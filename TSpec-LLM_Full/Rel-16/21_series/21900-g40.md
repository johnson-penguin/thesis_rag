Foreword
========

This Technical Specification has been produced by the 3^rd^ Generation
Partnership Project (3GPP).

The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work
within the TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the
TSG modify the contents of the present document, it will be re-released
by the TSG with an identifying change of release date and an increase in
version number as follows:

Version x.y.z

where:

x the first digit:

1 presented to TSG for information;

2 presented to TSG for approval;

3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.

y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e.
technical enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.

z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been
incorporated in the document.

Introduction
============

In order to ensure correctness and consistency of the specifications
(i.e., technical specifications and technical reports) under
responsibility of the Technical Specification Groups (TSG) of the 3^rd^
Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), clear, manageable and efficient
mechanisms are necessary to handle version control, change control,
document updating, distribution and management.

1 Scope
=======

This document outlines the working methods to be used by the 3GPP
Technical Specification Groups and their Working Groups and their
Sub-Groups, and by the 3GPP Support Team in relation to document
management, i.e. handling of specifications, updating procedures, Change
Request procedures, version control mechanisms, specifications status
information etc. It complements the rules and procedures defined for
3GPP. This document does not stipulate the details of the internal
working of the TSG Sub-Groups. From the Technical Specification Group
point of view, a task and responsibility is given to a Working Group
directly answering to the Technical Specification Group. In practice,
the work/task may be carried out in a subgroup of that Working Group.

1A References
=============

The following documents contain provisions which, through reference in
this text, constitute provisions of the present document.

\- References are either specific (identified by date of publication,
edition number, version number, etc.) or non‑specific.

\- For a specific reference, subsequent revisions do not apply.

\- For a non-specific reference, the latest version applies. In the case
of a reference to a 3GPP document (including a GSM document), a
non-specific reference implicitly refers to the latest version of that
document *in the same Release as the present document*.

\[8\] 3GPP TR 21.900 Release 17: \"Technical Specification Group working
methods\".

2 Definitions and abbreviations
===============================

For the purposes of the present document, the terms in 3GPP
TR 21.905 \[2\] apply.

3 to 9 void

10 Working methods for the present Release
==========================================

The provisions for this Release are identical with those for the latest
Release of 3GPP TR 21.900 \[8\].
