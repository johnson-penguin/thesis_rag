========

This Technical Specification has been produced by the 3^rd^ Generation
Partnership Project (3GPP).

The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work
within the TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the
TSG modify the contents of the present document, it will be re-released
by the TSG with an identifying change of release date and an increase in
version number as follows:

Version x.y.z

where:

x the first digit:

1 presented to TSG for information;

2 presented to TSG for approval;

3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.

y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e.
technical enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.

z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been
incorporated in the document.

1 Scope
=======

*The present document identifies the 3GPP system specifications for
Release 16. The specifications and reports of this Release have a major
version number 16 (i.e. 16.x.y). The listed Specifications are required
to build a system based on the Evolved Packet System.*

*The high-level architecture of such a system is defined in 3GPP TS
23.002 \[2\] (figure 1b).*
