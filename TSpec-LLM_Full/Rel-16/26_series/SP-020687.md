Speech Recognition Framework for Automated Voice Services; Stage 1 (SA1)

Stage 2 of Speech Recognition Framework for Automated Voice Services
(SA2)

SDP protocols extension to include Speech Enabled Services based on
Speech Recognition Framework (CN1)

**3 Justification**

This work is to support the codec aspects for speech enabled services as
specified in the requirements coming from SA1 in TS 22.243 v.6.0.0
"Speech Recognition Framework for Automated Voice Services; Stage 1"

**4 Objective**

**Will review and recommend codec(s)** **to support Speech Enabled
Services and include these in its specifications.** **To include**
**these** **within** **the stage 3** **specifications.**

A 3GPP speech recognition framework enables the use of conventional
codecs (e.g. AMR) or DSR optimized codecs to distribute in the network
the speech engines that process speech input or generate speech output.
It includes:

-   Default uplink and downlink codec specifications.

-   A stack of speech recognition protocols to support:

    -   Establishment of uplink and downlink sessions, along with codec
        negotiation

    -   Transport of speech recognition payload (uplink) with
        conversational QoS

    -   Support of transport (also at conversational QoS) of
        meta-information required for the deployment of speech
        recognition applications between the terminal and speech engines
        (meta-information may include terminal events and settings,
        audio sub-system events, parameters and settings, etc.).

SA4 will recommend a codec to be supported by default to deploy services
that rely on the 3GPP speech recognition framework.

Potential codecs to be considered are existing 3GPP speech codecs (e.g.
AMR, AMR-WB) or DSR optimized codecs.

This will be for packet switched network configurations and both UTRAN
and GERAN will be considered.
