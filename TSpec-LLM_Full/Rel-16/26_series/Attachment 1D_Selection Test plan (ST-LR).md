Introduction
============

This document contains the complete set of experimental designs for the
selection phase of the [Wideband Adaptive Multi-Rate extension codec
(AMR-WB+) as well as of the PSS/MMS low-rate audio codec
selection.]{.underline} The experiments are designed such that they are
relevant for both exercises.

The experiments are subdivided into two main blocks:

Experiments A: Intrinsic quality comparison of candidate codecs

Experiments B: Quality comparison under stressed operating conditions

Experimental block A will test the codecs in the following operational
modes:

-   14 kbps, mono, use case A (PSS)

-   18 kbps, stereo, use case A (PSS)

-   24 kbps, mono, use case A (PSS)

-   24 kbps, stereo, use case A (PSS)

Experimental block B will test the codecs under the following
operational conditions:

-   14 kbps, mono, use case B (MMS), 16 kHz input and output sampling
    rate.

-   18 kbps, stereo, use case B (MMS),

-   14 kbps, mono, use case A (PSS), 3% FER

-   24 kbps, stereo, use case A (PSS), 3% FER

Operational modes/conditions not covered by experimental blocks A and B,
for which performance requirements are defined, will be tested during
characterization of the selected codec.

Audio material classified according to the following four content types
will be used in all of the experiments:

-   Speech

-   Speech over Music

-   Speech and Music interlaced

-   Music

The experiments for each operational mode/condition further divide into
2 sub-experiments of manageable size with a mix of material out of each
content type class.

The following tables provide an overview of experimental block A and B:

Section 2 provides a list of candidate and reference codecs used in the
experiments.

Section 3 provides a list of reference documents related to the test
plan.

Section 4 specifies the kind of material to be used in the tests along
with a material selection procedure.

Section 5 gives general information relevant for all experiments.

Sections 6 and 7 contain the test plans for the two experimental blocks.

The specification of the processing functions of the audio material is
included in section 8

Annex A contains English language examples of instructions for the
listening subjects for the MUSHRA testss to be carried out.

Annex B presents the filename convention.

Responsibilities
----------------

The processing will be done by the host-lab T-Systems and Audio Research
Labs (mirror lab) and verified by the candidates. The funding for the
Selection and the characterization tests will be equally shared between
the proponents.

T-Systems will serve as host laboratory. The host laboratory will have
the following responsibilities:

-   Receive candidate testing material after the call for the material
    and distribute it to the material selection panel.

-   Prepare testing and training material based on the indications from
    the material selection panel.

-   Receive executables of the candidate codecs from the codec
    proponents.

-   Receive executables of the reference codecs.

-   Generate FER pattern file after receipt of the random generator
    seed.

-   Process reference, anchor and codec conditions (including
    re-sampling to sampling frequency of original material).

-   Cross-check the processing between the host laboratories and the
    codec proponents: provide the processed material to the codec
    proponents who cross-check.

-   Assemble the final distribution of the processed material to the
    listening laboratories, which includes blinding of the material.

Listening labs:

Fraunhofer Geselschaft (FhG), France Telecom (FT) , T-Systems (TS),
NTT-AT, Dynastat (D), Nokia (N), Ericsson (E), Coding Technologies (CT).

The selection experiments for each candidate codec are run by two
listening laboratories in parallel, as shown in Table 1-2.

Each listening lab will be asked to provide a full report of the
experiments performed. The test results will be included in spreadsheets
prepared to that purpose. Any deviations from the specifications
contained in this document will be documented along with the results.

The test results will then be combined by the Global Analysis Laboratory
(Audio Research Labs) and presented to SA4.

Codecs, Anchors and References
==============================

Candidate and Reference codecs
------------------------------

The experiments are designed to be able to accommodate 4 candidate
codecs. The number may however simply be adjusted downwards, if, e.g.
candidates decide to withdraw or decide not to be part in certain parts
of the experiments.

The following table provides an overview of the candidate codec
participating in the AMR-WB+ and PSS/MMS low-rate audio selection tests.

Anchors and references
----------------------

Besides the items encoded with the candidate and reference codecs,
anchor and reference items will be included in the tests. Their purpose
is to normalize the tests and to make them more comparable across
different realizations.

In the experiments testing mono signals two anchors will be used with
lowpass filtered original signal. In the experiments testing stereo
signals three anchors will be used, lowpass filtered and with reduced
stereo image.

Also included is the uncoded original signal, once as open and once as
hidden reference.

Test Material
=============

The test material will be composed according to the following approach.
First, a call will be sent out for test material (2-channels, sampled at
48 kHz) according to a number of generic audio signal categories. Then,
an independent selection entity \< tbd\> will identify a number of
items, which are representative for the application scenarios, out of
each category to be used in the experiments.

8 different sets of material covering 24 items according to the list
below will be used. Four for mono, four for stereo.

Original material will always be in stereo, for mono experiments it will
be downmixed following the procedures described in section 8
(processing).

The selection entity will identify based on uncoded material 8 sets of
material sampled at 48 kHz out of the following generic audio signal
categories:

-   Music with sub-categories (8 items)

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Single Instrument: e.g. piano, violin, clarinet

-   Vocal: e.g.: a cappella, solo singer

-   Choir

-   Pop

-   Classical (orchestra)

-   Other

-   Speech over music with sub-categories (4 items)

```{=html}

-   Speech with sub-categories (8 items)

```{=html}

```
-   Clean

-   Noisy: car/street/babble/sports event

For the items out of the speech category tested in the stereo
sub-experiments, the following stereo image categories apply:

-   Two talkers at different locations

-   Moving talker, fixed background

-   Fixed talker, moving background

Material with typical stereo images should be well represented in the
stereo experiments.

The selected number of items out of each sub-category shall be as
balanced as possible. The items containing speech or vocal elements
shall be balanced in speaker gender within each sub-category. The speech
items shall be in various languages.

The approximate lengths in time of the speech and speech over music
items will be 5 s. These items shall comprise one sentence of speech and
not contain speech pauses.

The music and speech between music items shall not exceed a length of 10
s.

The complete set of material will be split and equally distributed to
the sub-experiments.

Material selection
------------------

The selection entity is/are some independent organization(s) agreed by
SA4.

Proposed material has to be submitted to the selection entity after
submission date of the candidate codecs and before the material
submission deadline according to the schedule.

The selection entity will make the material selection according to the
material selection criteria specified in the above section 4.

All 3GPP members are invited to submit test material to host lab. The
submitting organization shall assign the items to the above-mentioned
content main- and sub-categories. The host lab will blind the material
and provide it to the material selection entity.

This ensures the selection is based on items whose origin is not
revealed to the selection entity.

The host lab will further maintain and report to SA4 a list indicating
the number of proposed items per submitting organization.

In case the submitted material is insufficient/inadequate to conduct the
tests, the selection entity will indicate out of the available and
suitable material 16 sets of material containing 12 items. As a
guideline, it should be ensured that each set contains the proper number
of items out of each sub-category. The criterion for defining the sets
should be to have a material distribution in each sub-experiment, which
is as broad and representative as possible -- according to the criteria
given above. The aim is thus to get 16 partly disjoint sets. By this it
is at least ensured to get the best possible material randomization and
each of the 16 different sub-experiments will be carried out with a
partly \'new\' set.

The selection entity will provide SA4 with a report about the selection
process.

Training material
-----------------

Limited material will be used in the training phase in which the
subjects familiarize with the testing methodology and environment.

The training will be made with four sound items, one out of each audio
signal category. These items will be identified by the selection entity
and shall not be re-used in the blind grading phase. The training phase
shall be executed as a separate short MUSHRA session.

Information relevant to all Experiments
=======================================

General Technical Notes
-----------------------

Any and all deviations from the specifications contained in this
document must be documented and submitted to TSG-SA-WG4 along with the
experimental results.

For all experiments, subjects should be seated in a quiet environment;
30dBA Hoth Spectrum (as defined by ITU-T, Recommendation P.800, Annex A,
section A.1.1.2.2.1 Room Noise, with table A.1 and Figure A.1) measured
at the head position of the subject. This will help ensure consistency
between the different subjects in the same laboratory as well as across
the different laboratories in which these experiments will be performed.

The test stimuli will be presented to the subjects over headphones
meeting one of the following requirements:

1\) Binaural listening using closed-back, supra-aural headphones;

2\) Binaural listening using open-back, circum-aural headphones.

Testing methodology
-------------------

The testing is carried out according to MUSHRA methodology \[1\], which
is suitable for evaluation of intermediate audio quality and gives
accurate and reliable results.

The labs carrying out the testing should have experience with the MUSHRA
method from earlier exercises.

The MUSHRA test method applied here uses the original unprocessed
material with full bandwidth as the reference signal (which is also used
as a hidden reference), a number of hidden anchors, the conditions of
the codecs under test as well as the reference conditions with which the
codecs under test are to be compared.

Error Patterns and Error Conditions
-----------------------------------

Error conditions will be applied in experimental block B according to
AMR-WB+ performance requirements, v. 2.0 (Tdoc S4-030434) and PSS/MMS
Audio Codec Selection, Design Constraints and Performance Requirements
-- Version 2.0. Details on the availability of the error pattern and its
application are given in section 8 (Processing). .

Training phase
--------------

Prior to the actual testing a training phase is carried out in which the
test subjects are familiarized with testing methodology and environment.
The training is done following the same MUSHRA methodology as the actual
test, though limited to four trials.

The training is based on the same codec, anchor and reference conditions
as the blind grading phase.

Selection of subjects
---------------------

The selection of subjects follows the guidelines given in \[1\].

In particular, it is recommended that experienced listeners should be
used. These listeners should have some experience in listening to sound
in a critical way. Such listeners will give a more reliable result more
quickly than non-experienced listeners.

### Screening of subjects

There is sometimes a reason for introducing a rejection technique either
before (pre-screening) or after (post-screening) the real test. In some
cases both types of rejections might be used. Here, rejection is a
process where all judgements from a particular subject are omitted.

Any type of rejection technique, not carefully analysed and applied, may
lead to a biased result. It is thus extremely important that, whenever
elimination of data has been made, the test report clearly describes the
criterion applied.

#### Pre-screening of subjects

The listening panel should be composed of experienced listeners, in
other words, people who understand and have been properly trained in the
described method of subjective quality evaluation. These listeners
should:

-   have experience in listening to sound in a critical way;

-   have normal hearing (ISO Standard 389 should be used as a
    guideline).

The training procedure might be used as a tool for pre-screening.

#### Post-screening of subjects

Post-screening methods can be roughly separated into at least two
classes:

-   one is based on the ability of the subject to make consistent
    repeated gradings;

-   the other relies on inconsistencies of an individual grading
    compared with the mean result of all subjects for a given item.

It is recommended to look to the individual spread and to the deviation
from the mean grading of all subjects.

The aim of this is to get a fair assessment of the quality of the test
items.

If few subjects use either extreme end of the scale (excellent, bad) and
the majority are concentrated at another point on the scale, these
subjects could be recognized as outliers and might be rejected.

Due to the fact that "intermediate quality" is tested, a subject should
be able to identify the coded version very easily and therefore find a
grade which is in the range of the majority of the subjects. Subjects
with grades at the upper end of the scale are likely to be less critical
and subjects who have grades only at the lowest end of the scale are
likely to be too critical. By rejecting these extreme subjects a more
realistic quality assessment is expected.

The methods are primarily used to eliminate subjects who cannot make the
appropriate discriminations. The application of a post-screening method
may clarify the tendencies in a test result. However, bearing in mind
the variability of subjects' sensitivities to different artefacts,
caution should be exercised.

Taking into account the size of the listening panel used throughout the
experiments, the effects of any individual subject's grades is low and
so the need to reject a subject's data is greatly diminished.

Experimental Block A
====================

Introduction
------------

The experiments in this block are designed to evaluate the error-free,
generic audio signal performance of the candidate codecs under ideal
conditions.

The experimental block covers four experiments:

-   14 kbps, mono, use case A (PSS)

-   18 kbps, stereo, use case A (PSS)

-   24 kbps, mono, use case A (PSS)

-   24 kbps, stereo, use case A (PSS)

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Each experiment comprises 2 sub-experiments, which are equally
    designed but carried out with set a, b or c, respectively, of the
    test material.

The details provided in this section are those that are specific to this
particular experiment. Generic information, relevant to this and other
experiments can be found in Section 5. Therefore Listening Laboratories
should use the information in Section 5 in conjunction with the
information given in this section.

+-----------------------------+-----+------------------------------+

Material
--------

See section 4.

Experimental Design
-------------------

See section 5.2

Opinion Scale
-------------

The question asked of the subject will be a continuous Listening Quality
Scale ranging from 0 to 100.

The intervals 0 to 20 correspond to BAD, 20 to 40 to POOR, 40-60 to
FAIR, 60 to 80 to GOOD, and 80 to 100 to EXCELLENT.

Processing
----------

Processing is specified in section 8.

Duration of the Experiment
--------------------------

The duration of the experiment per subject depends on the number of
trials and on the number of items per trial. However, it can be assumed
that each vote requires listening to the respective item, the open
reference and two (quality-wise) neighboring items 2 times. With an
assumed average length per item of 7.5 s, the test will consume a
listening time per subject of:

\#trial \* \#hidden items/trial \* (1+1+2) \* \#re-listenings \*
length/item.

For the blind grading phase in each of the sub-experiments this accounts
to

12 \* 8 \* 4 \* 2 \* 7.5s = 1.6 hours per subject (mono tests) or,
respectively,

12 \* 9 \* 4 \* 2 \* 7.5s = 1.8 hours per subject

For the training phase the number of re-listenings is assumed to be 1.
For each of the sub-experiments this accounts to

4 \* 8 \* 4 \* 1 \* 7.5s = 16 min per subject (mono tests) or,
respectively,

4 \* 9 \* 4 \* 1 \* 7.5s = 18 min per subject

In order to avoid listener fatigue, sufficient breaks are required
between the trials.

The experiments can be carried out with several subjects in parallel
provided that a corresponding number of proper listening facilities are
available.

Votes Per Condition
-------------------

The number of votes per conditions is identical with the number of
subjects per sub-experiment.

Randomizations
--------------

Each listener will be presented with the sound items in an individual
random presentation order. Also the order of the trials will be random
per individual.

Experimental Block B
====================

Introduction
------------

The experiments in this block are designed to evaluate the audio signal
performance of the candidate codecs under stressed operating conditions.

The experimental block covers four experiments:

-   14 kbps, mono, use case B (MMS), 16 kHz sampling rate

-   18 kbps, stereo, use case B (MMS),

-   14 kbps, mono, use case A (PSS), 3% FER

-   24 kbps, stereo, use case A (PSS), 3% FER

Each experiment comprises 2 sub-experiments, which are equally designed
but carried out with set a, b or c, respectively, of the test material.

The details provided in this section are those that are specific to this
particular experiment. Generic information, relevant to this and other
experiments can be found in Section 5. Therefore Listening Laboratories
should use the information in Section 5 in conjunction with the
information given in this section.

Material
--------

See section 4.

Experimental Design
-------------------

See section 5.2

Opinion Scale
-------------

The question asked of the subject will be a continuous Listening Quality
Scale ranging from 0 to 100.

The intervals 0 to 20 correspond to BAD, 20 to 40 to POOR, 40-60 to
FAIR, 60 to 80 to GOOD, and 80 to 100 to EXCELLENT.

Processing
----------

Processing is specified in section 8.

Duration of the Experiment
--------------------------

The duration of the experiment per subject depends on the number of
trials and on the number of items per trial. However, it can be assumed
that each vote requires listening to the respective item, the open
reference and two (quality-wise) neighboring items 2 times. With an
assumed average length per item of 7.5 s, the test will consume a
listening time per subject of:

\#trial \* \#hidden items/trial \* (1+1+2) \* \#re-listenings \*
length/item.

For the blind grading phase in each of the sub-experiments this accounts
to

12 \* 8 \* 4 \* 2 \* 7.5s = 1.6 hours per subject (mono tests) or,
respectively,

12 \* 9 \* 4 \* 2 \* 7.5s = 1.8 hours per subject

For the training phase the number of re-listenings is assumed to be 1.
For each of the sub-experiments this accounts to

4 \* 8 \* 4 \* 1 \* 7.5s = 16 min per subject (mono tests) or,
respectively,

4 \* 9 \* 4 \* 1 \* 7.5s = 18 min per subject

In order to avoid listener fatigue, sufficient breaks are required
between the trials.

The experiments can be carried out with several subjects in parallel
provided that a corresponding number of proper listening facilities are
available.

Votes Per Condition
-------------------

The number of votes per conditions is identical with the number of
subjects per sub-experiment.

Randomizations
--------------

Each listener will be presented with the sound items in an individual
random presentation order. Also the order of the trials will be random
per individual.

The statistical significance of the results obtained in the
sub-experiments with frame erasures may suffer from the effect that --
due to different frame sizes of the candidate codecs -- the frame
erasures become effective at different points in time. The subjective
relevancy of the frame erasure will thus not only depend on the frame
error mitigation procedure of the codec candidates but also on the
signal characteristic of the sound item at the erased frames.

In order to statistically mitigate this latter effect as much as
possible there will be a randomization of the error patterns across the
various listeners, the two sub-experiments B3 and B4 and the various
listening labs. I.e. for each individual listening different error
patterns will be used.

Processing
==========

Common for the processing of all conditions is that it will be done with
concatenated material. To that purpose in a pre-processing step, for
each experiment the material required for it including training material
will be concatenated to one single file. This file will then in the
main-processing step(s) be processed through the respective candidate or
reference codecs, or the specific anchor signal processing will be
applied. After processing and proper compensation of the processing
delay, the material will finally be sampling-rate converted and split-up
again to separate items.

Pre-processing
--------------

In general, the material selection panel is responsible for selection of
proper training and test material. However, for clean speech items, a
particular pre-processing is necessary for removing possible silence
segments included in the original speech item files.

After this speech-specific pre-processing the complete material will be
concatenated to one single file.

### Clean speech items

The pre-processing for the speech items has to make sure that leading
and trailing silence segments are removed. A corresponding program tool
will be provided by:

Volunteering organization Ericsson

The host lab will do the pre-processing applying that script.

### Concatenation of material 

The concatenation will be done using an executable script. The script
will take as input all items of the training material and the test
material belonging to the respective experiment. The order in the
concatenation is such that the training material will precede the test
material. In order to ensure that the last items in the concatenated
file will not be clipped as cause of frame-wise processing or codec
delay, a short artificial silence item will be added to the end of the
concatenated file. Output of the concatenation script will be a single
file containing the concatenated material and a time-file comprising
name identifiers and time markers of the individual items. The time-file
will be used after processing for split-up of the material to the
individual items.

The concatenation script will be provided by:

Volunteering organization Ericsson.

Main processing
---------------

### Processing of anchor conditions, 16 kHz downsampling, stereo to mono mixing

The anchor conditions as well as re-sampling and stereo to mono mixing
are performed using a script making use of tools of the AFSP library
such as "ResampAudio" and "CopyAudio".

The tools are freely available on the Internet, the processing script
and a copy of the required tools (including usage assistance, if
necessary) will be provided by Coding Technologies.

The command line syntax of the processing script is as follows:

anchor --lp\<cut-off\> --s\<stereo\_degree\> --fsout16000 --monoout
\<infile.wav\> \<outfile\>,

where --lp\<cut-off\>, --s\<stereo\_degree\>, --fsout16000, and
--monoout are optional arguments and

\<cut-off\> = {3500, 7000} is the cut-off frequency of the low-pass to
be used, and

\<stereo\_degree\> = {6, 12} is the side channel attenuation in dB.

The argument --fsout16000 is supplied if the signal has to be re-sampled
to 16 kHz sampling frequency.

The argument --monoout is supplied if the output signal has to be a
one-channel mono-signal.

The input file is assumed to be of wav format.

The output file format is wav if the name has the extension .wav. If it
contains the extension .raw, then a headerless 1-channel (mono) 16 bit
PCM file is generated.

### Candidate and reference codec processing

The concatenated material file will be created by the hostlab. After
processing, the encoded material as well as the concatenated original
files will be delivered to candidates for cross-checking. The candidates
make sure that possible codec delay is properly compensated. The
procedure of how the delay was compensated need to be reported as part
of the respective candidate codec descriptions.

The analogue processing procedure will be applied to the reference
codecs. For the AMR-WB reference codec, prior to actual codec processing
the concatenated material is P.341 filtered. This filtering operation is
performed using the *filter* program from the ITU-T STL (STL 2000):

> Source: ITU-T
>
> Location: STL sub-directory: fir
>
> Format: C source code
>
> Program: *filter*

To produce a P.341 filtered file use:

filter P341 input16 output16 320

#### Impaired channel processing

The host lab does the impaired channel processing with a FER pattern
file identifying correct and erroneous frames. The host lab will produce
that file using a script provided by:

Volunteering organization: Ericsson

The input to the script is a seed to the random generator included in
the script. It will be provided by ETSI Secretary, Paolo Usai after
candidate submission.

The format of the FER pattern file is ASCII text with one line per
frame. A '0' (zero) in a line indicates a correct frame, a '1' (one)
indicates a frame erasure.

The length of the file will be sufficient to cover the complete
concatenated training and test material, assuming a minimum frame length
of 10 ms. Note, that depending on the actual frame size of the
individual candidate codecs, the FER pattern file will not be applied in
its entire length.

In order to realize the randomization of the error patterns across each
individual listening (see paragraph 7.9), before application the error
pattern file will be circularly shifted with individual time offsets.
The time offset (in frames) for listener *s*, lab *p* and experiment *e*
(B3=1, B4=2) is calculated as follows:

$\text{offs} = \text{mod}(s \cdot \text{12345} + p \cdot \text{31415} + e \cdot \text{27183},\text{totlen})$,
where *totlen* is the total length of the FER pattern file (in frames).

The circular shift will be done using an executable script with the
command line syntax:

shiftcirc --\<offs\> \<inpat\> \<outpat\>

The script will be provided by Ericsson.

Post-processing
---------------

The post-processing comprises the steps of up-sampling to the original
sampling frequency of 48 kHz and split-up of the concatenated material.

### Up-sampling

Resampling to the original sampling frequency of 48 kHz will be done
using a script with the following command-line syntax:

upsamp48 --fs\<fsamp\> \<infile\> \<outfile.wav\>

The script will make use of AFSP tools such as "ResampAudio".

In order to avoid possible signal clipping distortions introduced after
re-sampling during the conversion of the internal floating-point to the
16-bit integer representation of the wav-file, before this conversion
the re-sampled signal is attenuated by applying a constant factor of
0.93 (â‰ˆ -0.3 dB).

Note, in order to ensure that this factor is consistently applied to all
codec, anchor and reference conditions, the program must always be
applied, even if actually no re-sampling is necessary since the sampling
rate of the respective signal is already 48 kHz.

The optional argument --fs\<fsamp\> to the processing script needs to be
supplied in case of a PCM input signal and specifies the sampling
frequency in Hz.

The input file format is wav if the name has the extension .wav. If it
has the extension .raw, then a headerless 1-channel (mono) 16 bit PCM
file is assumed. In this latter case, the --fs option has to be
supplied.

The tools are freely available on the Internet, the processing script
and a copy of the required tools (including usage assistance, if
necessary) will be provided by Coding Technologies.

### Split-up of processed material

The split-up of the processed material to partial sound files will be
done using a script which is functionally inverse to the concatenation
procedure described in section 8.1.2. The program will take the
concatenated and processed (and delay-compensated) file along with the
time-file as input. On time intervals of length 2*N* around the time
markers *n~i~* indicated by the time-file it will first apply a
roll-off/roll-on window with Hanning characteristic:

and then split-up the file at the time markers *n~i~*. *N* corresponds
to a roll-off/roll-on time of 100 ms. I.e. *N*=0.1 \* *f~s~* where
*f~s~* = 48 kHz. Partial sound files will be generated with names
according to the name identifiers comprised in the time-file and a
processing tag, identifying the kind of processing.

This actual split-up and windowing is performed using the *astrip*
program from the ITU-T STL (STL 2000):

> Source: ITU-T
>
> Location: STL sub-directory: unsupported
>
> Format: C source code
>
> Program: *astrip*

The split-up script will have the following command-line syntax:

splitup \<infile\> \<processing\_tag\> \<timefile\>

The processing tag is an arbitrary string which is added to the name
identifiers given in the time-file.

The generated output files are of wav format.

The script will be provided by Ericsson

Blinding of material
--------------------

The purpose of blinding is to unveil the identity of the different
codec, reference and anchor conditions. The blinding is done using a
script that maps the de-concatenated items onto files with names
unveiling the actual condition. The mapping shall vary across the
different items.

The blinding of the material is made by the host lab, based on a script
created by the host lab. The host lab is responsible to keep the mapping
confidential.

Annex A: Listeners Instructions {#annex-a-listeners-instructions .MyHeading-1}
===============================

The following is an example of the type of instructions that should be
given to or read to the subjects in order to instruct them on how to
perform the test.

Instructions to be given to subjects

1 Training phase {#training-phase-1 .list-paragraph}
================

The first step in the listening tests is to become familiar with the
testing process. This phase is called a training phase and it precedes
the formal evaluation or blind grading phase.

The purpose of the training phase is to allow you, as an evaluator, to
learn how to use the test equipment and the grading scale.

In the training phase you will make a short test similar to the one you
will make in the blind grading phase of the test.

No grades given during the training phase will be taken into account in
the actual tests.

2 Blind grading phase {#blind-grading-phase .list-paragraph}
=====================

The purpose of the blind grading phase is to invite you to assign your
grades using the quality scale. Your grades should reflect your
subjective judgement of the quality level for each of the sound excerpts
presented to you. Each trial will contain \<x\> signals to be graded.
Each of the items is approximately 5 to 10 s long. You should listen to
the reference and all the test conditions by clicking on the respective
buttons. In a first step it is recommended to browse through all signals
within each trial in order to get a coarse impression of the offered
quality range. Then you may listen more carefully and start to rank the
signals. You may listen to the signals in any order, any number of
times. Use the slider for each signal to indicate your opinion of its
quality. When you are satisfied with your grading of all signals you
should click on the "register scores" button at the bottom of the
screen.

You will use the quality scale as given in Fig. 1 when assigning your
grades.

The grading scale is continuous from "excellent" to "bad". A grade of 0
corresponds to the bottom of the "bad" category, while a grade of 100
corresponds to the top of the "excellent" category.

In evaluating the sound excerpts, please note that you should not
necessarily give a grade in the "bad" category to the sound excerpt with
the lowest quality in the test. However one or more excerpts must be
given a grade of 100 because the unprocessed reference signal is
included as one of the excerpts to be graded.

You should not discuss your personal interpretation or your gradings
with the other subjects at any time during the test.

B-4 File naming {#b-4-file-naming .list-paragraph}
===============

A suggested file naming convention is given below. It is though the
freedom of the host labs to choose other, possibly more appropriate
naming conventions as long as they are well documented and unambiguous.

1\. Unprocessed original signals:

\<main\_category\>\_\<sub\_category\>\_\<stereo\_category\>\_\<item\_no\>\_org.wav

where

-   \<main\_category\> is one out of {m, som, sbm, s} (for music, speech
    over music, speech between music, speech),

-   \<sub\_category\> is one out of

    -   {si, vo, ch, po, cl, ot} for music main category (single
        > instrument, vocal, choir, pop, classical, other)

    -   {ne, ad, fi, ot} for speech over music main category (news
        > trailer, advertisement, film sound track, other)

    -   {sm, ms, js, sj, as, ot} for speech between music main category,
        > and

    -   {cl, no} for speech main category (clean, noisy)

-   \<stereo\_category\> is one out of {2t, mt, ft} for the speech
    category tested in the stereo sub-experiments (two talkers, moving
    talker, fixed talker) and {x} for all other items without explicit
    stereo category.

-   \<item\_no\> is a number identifying the item out of the respective
    main and sub-category.

2\. Pre-processed original signals after (possible) speech-silence
clipping:

\<main\_category\>\_\<sub\_category\>\_\<stereo\_category\>\_\<item\_no\>.wav

Note, that even for non-speech files for which no silence-clipping will
be applied files according to this naming have to be created (by copy
operation) as these files will serve as input files to the sub-sequent
concatenation step.

3\. Pre-processed original signals after concatenation:

all\_cat.wav

The corresponding time-file comprising the segmentation information is:

all\_cat.tim

4\. Material after main processing:

all\_cat\_\<codec\_id\>\_\<exp\_id\>.wav

where

-   \<codec\_id\> is one out of

    -   {cand\_1, cand\_2, cand\_3, AAC, AMRWB, lp3500\_s12,
        lp7000\_s12, lp7000\_s6, hidref, opref} for the experiments
        involving stereo and

    -   {cand\_1, cand\_2, cand\_3, AAC, AMRWB, lp3500, lp7000, hidref,
        opref} for the experiments in mono.

    -   

-   \<exp\_id\> is one out of {A1, A2, A3, A4, B1, B2, B3, B4}

5\. Processed material after de-concatenation:

\<main\_category\>\_\<sub\_category\>\_\<stereo\_category\>\_\<item\_no\>\_\<codec\_id\>\_\<exp\_id\>.wav

6\. Processed material after allocation to sub-experiments:

\<main\_category\>\_\<sub\_category\>\_\<stereo\_category\>\_\<item\_no\>\_\<codec\_id\>\_\<exp\_id\>\_\<sub\_exp\>.wav

where \<sub\_exp\> is one out of {a, b}.

7\. Processed material after blinding:

\<main\_category\>\_\<sub\_category\>\_\<stereo\_category\>\_\<item\_no\>\_\<exp\_id\>\_\<sub\_exp\>\_\<cond\_id\>.wav

where \<cond\_id\> is one out of

-   {cond\[1-8\], opref} for the mono experiments and

-   {cond\[1-10\], opref} for the stereo experiments.
