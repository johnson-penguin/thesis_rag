3 Definitions and abbreviations
===============================

3.1 Definitions
---------------

For the purposes of the present document, the terms and definitions
given in 3GPP TS 42.068 and the following apply:

**group call anchor MSC:** the MSC responsible for managing and
maintaining a particular voice group call. The group call anchor MSC is
determined as the one controlling the cells of the group call area (see
also group call relay MSC). For a voice group call where the group call
area exceeds one MSC area, the group call anchor MSC is predefined in
the network. In a RANflex configuration with group call redundancy, the
group call anchor MSC redundancy pool (instead of a group call anchor
MSC) is predefined in a network for a given voice group call.

**Group Call Attributes (GCA):** group call area, dispatcher identities,
and the non-activity time which results in the release of the voice
group call by the network

**group call relay MSC:** the MSC controlling cells of a group call area
which are not under control of the group call anchor MSC for those voice
group call services where the group call area exceeds one MSC area. For
a voice group call where the group area exceeds one MSC area, the
address of the group call relay MSC is pre-configured in the anchor
MSC\'s GCR. In a RANflex configuration with group call redundancy this
preconfigured address identifies a group call relay MSC redundancy pool
(instead of a group call relay MSC).

**Group Call Register (GCR):** functionality in the network containing
the group call attributes

**group call serving MSC:** In a RANflex configuration the group call
serving MSC of a location area is a group call anchor MSC or a group
call relay MSC that controls the group call signalling for this location
area. A location area within the pool area has a unique group call
serving MSC, or - in a RANflex configuration with group call redundancy
- a unique group call serving MSC redundancy pool. For a given group
call at any location, the group call serving MSC is either the anchor
MSC or one of the relay MSCs controlling the group call. For a service
subscriber located in this location area the visited MSC may be
different from the location area\'s group call serving MSC.

In a RANflex configuration all location areas within a BSC service area
are assigned to the same group call serving MSC.

In a RANflex configuration with group call redundancy all location areas
within a BSC service area are assigned to the same group call serving
MSC redundancy pool.

**group call serving MSC redundancy pool:** A pool of group call serving
MSCs each of which can take the same role for a given group call (anchor
/relay) and serve the same location areas within a RANflex pool area
with group call services. For a given voice group call a location
area\'s group call serving MSC redundancy pool is either the group call
anchor MSC redundancy pool or one of the group call relay MSC redundancy
pools.

**group call anchor MSC redundancy pool:** A group call serving MSC
redundancy pool. Each MSC within the group call anchor MSC redundancy
pool can take the role of the group call anchor MSC for a given group
call. For a given instance of a voice group call one group call anchor
MSC is selected from the group call anchor MSC redundancy pool.

**group call relay MSC redundancy pool:** A group call serving MSC
redundancy pool. Each MSC within the group call relay MSC redundancy
pool can take the role of the group call relay MSC for a given group
call. For a given instance of a voice group call one group call relay
MSC is selected from every relevant group call relay MSC redundancy
pool.

**group members:** service subscribers entitled to belong to a
particular group classified by a certain group identification (group ID)

**group mode dedicated channel:** In this mode, a mobile station
participating in an ongoing voice group call is allocated at least two
dedicated channels, only one of them being a SACCH

**notification:** notifications are given on common control channels or
dedicated channels in order to inform group members which are either in
idle mode or in dedicated mode or participating in a voice group call or
voice broadcast call on the existence of voice group calls

**Notification CHannel (NCH):** common control channel on which the
notifications are sent by the network (equivalent to a paging channel)

**originator-to-dispatcher information:** information sent by the
service subscriber originating a voice group call to the network during
call setup for distribution to the dispatchers to be attached to the
group call during call setup

**RANflex configuration:** A network configuration that allows a
location area to be served by multiple MSCs in parallel. For details see
3GPP TS 23.236 \[17\]. In a RANflex configuration a given location area
is associated with a single group call serving MSC. There is no support
of group call redundancy.

**RANflex configuration with group call redundancy**: A RANflex
configuration where a given location area is associated with a group
call serving MSC redundancy pool (instead of with a single group call
serving MSC). For a given voice group call a location area\'s group call
serving MSC redundancy pool may be a group call anchor MSC redundancy
pool or a group call relay MSC redundancy pool.

**voice group call channel:** combined uplink/downlink to be allocated
in a cell of the group call area for a particular voice group call\
The uplink can be used by the presently talking service subscriber only.
All mobile stations of the listening service subscribers in one cell
shall listen to the common downlink.

**voice group call member:** any group member or dispatcher
participating in an on going voice group call

**point-to-point short message:** information that may be transferred
between a mobile station and a Service Center

**time-critical application-specific data:** application-specific data
which shall be transferred within the time limitation specified in 3GPP
TS 42.068.

For the purposes of the present document, the following terms and
definitions given in 3GPP TS 24.008 \[7\] apply.

**dedicated mode**

**group receive mode**

**group transmit mode**

4 Main concepts
===============

4.1 Group definition
--------------------

Service subscribers can become group members on a PLMN wide basis to one
or more groups pre-defined in the network by a corresponding group
identification (group ID). The membership enables them to initiate or
receive voice group calls associated with that group ID. Certain
dispatchers connected to external networks also require the capability
to initiate or receive voice group calls.

A prefix can be used together with the group ID to define a subset of
the group members and to restrict the group of service subscribers able
to receive a voice group call to this subset.

In addition to subscriber details in the HLR, it is necessary for the
mobile station to be aware of its group membership by storing details on
the SIM/USIM. This is required because it shall respond to notification
messages which include only the group ID (i.e. no IMSI or TMSI details).

Having become a group member, each service subscriber can set to active
state or deactive state the group ID or any one out of his several group
IDs on the SIM/USIM. In active state the subscriber can initiate voice
group calls to that group. When in deactive state the subscriber can not
make voice group calls to the group and the mobile station ignores any
notification for that group.

If no NCH is defined in the cell, mobiles shall assume VGCS service is
not available on that cell.

4.2 Group conversations
-----------------------

### 4.2.1 Group call initiation

#### 4.2.1.1 Normal operation with successful outcome

A group call area can be restricted to a single MSC area or can exceed
one MSC area. In a RANflex configuration (with or without group call
redundancy) a group call area can be restricted to a single pool area or
can exceed one pool area.

A voice group call shall be initiated by a calling service subscriber by
a related input function, e.g. via MMI, specifying the selected service
and the group ID dialled or by a calling dispatcher by the MSISDN
address (see subclause 9.2). As an option, a calling service subscriber
may add a prefix to the group ID. As an option, the request of the
calling service subscriber to set up a voice group call may specify
information to be sent as originator-to-dispatcher information to the
network; in this case the originator‑to‑dispatcher information is
included in the signalling for call setup from the mobile station to the
network. It is the responsibility of the input function to ensure that
the originator-to-dispatcher information has a correct format (in
particular, an allowed length).

As a further option, the request of the calling subscriber may indicate
one of the following talker priorities, listed in ascending order of
talker priority:

\- normal subscriber;

\- privileged subscriber;

\- emergency subscriber.

A mobile station supporting the use of talker priorities shall check
with the SIM/USIM whether the subscriber is allowed to use the requested
talker priority for the respective group ID before signalling the talker
priority to the network.

On reception of a VGCS setup request with a talker priority different
from \"normal subscriber\", the MSC shall check with the VLR whether the
subscriber has a subscription to use this talker priority. If the
subscriber is not allowed to use the requested talker priority, the MSC
shall reduce the talker priority to a value the subscriber is allowed to
use. In any case the talker priority used by the MSC shall be signalled
back to the calling service subscriber in the Connect message.

If a VGCS setup request with talker priority \"emergency subscriber\" is
received by the network and the subscription check is successful, the
network shall set the emergency mode for this voice group call. The
emergency mode may be reset during the voice group call (see subclause
4.2.2.1).

If a prefix is added to the group ID, the MSC shall ignore the prefix
when performing the subscription check.

The MSC in which a voice group call is initiated obtains the group call
attributes by requesting the Group Call Register (GCR, see clause 5).
Without a RANflex configuration or in a RANflex configuration (with or
without group call redundancy), if visited MSC and group call serving
MSC are identical, the MSC performs a local GCR interrogation.

The local GCR interrogation after call initiation also determines
whether the MSC shall act as anchor or as relay MSC. If the MSC is not
the anchor MSC then the call will be \"forwarded\" from the relay to the
respective anchor MSC (information also delivered by GCR) and further
\"call-establishment\" is done by the anchor MSC as described in the
following.

In a RANflex configuration the VMSC in which a voice group call is
initiated may be different from the group call serving MSC of the voice
group call initiating subscriber\'s location area. In this case the VMSC
derives the identity of the group call serving MSC from the initiating
subscriber\'s LAC and requests the group call anchor MSC address from
the group call serving MSC by means of the SEND\_GROUP\_CALL\_INFO MAP
service. The call is then \"forwarded\" from the VMSC to the anchor MSC
and further \"call-establishment\" is done by the anchor MSC as
described in the following.

In a RANflex configuration with group call redundancy the VMSC in which
a voice group call is initiated may not belong to the group call serving
MSC redundancy pool of the voice group call initiating subscriber\'s
location area. In this case the VMSC derives the identity of the group
call serving MSC redundancy pool from the initiating subscriber\'s LAC
and requests the group call anchor MSC redundancy pool address from the
group call serving MSC by means of the SEND\_GROUP\_CALL\_INFO MAP
service. The call is then \"forwarded\" from the VMSC to the anchor MSC
redundancy pool and further \"call-establishment\" is done by the
selected anchor MSC as described in the following.

When a calling service subscriber or calling dispatcher initiates a
voice group call, one voice group call channel shall be established in
each cell of the group call area and notifications for that call shall
be sent in each of these cells. As an alternative, voice group call
channels may only be established in cells in reaction to responses
received from mobile stations on the notifications using notification
response procedure. At the same time standard connections to dispatchers
in the mobile network or in an external network shall be established. If
originator-to-dispatcher information has been received in the signalling
for call setup from the mobile station to the network and if the
originating MSC supports processing of originator‑to‑dispatcher
information, this information is transformed into user-to-user
information and sent to the dispatchers as UUS1 when setting up the
standard connections.

A voice group call channel shall consist of a combined uplink/downlink.
The uplink will be used exclusively by the presently talking service
subscriber. All mobile stations of the listening service subscribers in
one cell shall only listen to the same common downlink.

During call establishment there are different options for the network to
allocate a speech channel for the calling service subscriber:

In the first option, the calling service subscriber shall have its
dedicated standard connection during call establishment and for the
first period when he will be the talking service subscriber up to the
time when the network decides that he shall join the voice group call
channel. The mobile station of the calling service subscriber shall then
go to the voice group call channel and the dedicated standard connection
shall be released.

In the second option, the network shall allocate a dedicated signalling
channel (e.g. SDCCH) to be used by the mobile station up to the time
when the voice group call channel in the originating cell is established
and the network decides that the mobile station shall join the voice
group call channel.

Only one voice group call channel shall be established in each cell for
any given voice group call, although there may be a number of
simultaneous voice group calls within the same cell.

Destination service subscribers shall be notified on the voice group
call in each cell. These voice group call notification messages shall be
broadcast on the Notification CHannel (NCH).

The notification messages use the group ID rather than individual
TMSIs/IMSIs. If the length of the group ID is less than 8 decimal digits
, then the group call area ID is used in order to enable a resolution in
the case of overlapping group call areas. A service subscriber\'s mobile
station needs to be able to recognise notification messages for those
group IDs subscribed to and presently activated. If the mobile station
supports the use of prefixes with group IDs and has stored prefixes for
a group ID, it shall take these prefixes into account following
detection of a match of the group ID.

The network may also send messages on appropriate voice group call
channel FACCHs, in order to notify group call members who may
participate in other voice group calls. In addition, also paging
information messages for standard calls may be sent in order to inform
group call members on actually paged point-to-point calls.

Further the network may provide notification on the voice group call to
service subscribers who have subscribed to the paged group ID and which
are in dedicated mode. The process of broadcasting messages on NCHs is
to be carried out throughout the call in order to provide the \"late
entry\" facility whereby group members entering the area can join the
call.

If the emergency mode is set for a voice group call, the network shall
include an emergency mode indication in the voice group call
notification messages sent on the NCH, the group call channel FACCHs of
all other ongoing voice group calls, voice broadcast calls, and the
FACCHs associated with dedicated channels.

On receiving notification of a voice group call a group call member\'s
mobile station shall adjust to the nominated channel to receive the
voice group call if this channel was described in the notification
message and receive the information on the downlink. Whilst receiving,
the mobile station shall not transmit on the uplink SACCH. This group
receive mode is different to the normal idle mode or dedicated mode. If
no channel description was provided in the notification message, the
mobile station shall establish a dedicated connection by use of the
notification response procedure in order to respond to the notification.
The network may then provide the mobile station with a channel
description for the voice group call.

As a further mobile station option, the mobile station may read its
paging subchannel in the current cell while in group receive mode or in
group transmit mode in order to receive paging messages for mobile
terminated calls.

#### 4.2.1.2 Exceptional procedures

Completion of links into congested cells where pre-emption did not occur
is required.

On receiving details of a voice group call the user may choose to move
to the notified call or the mobile station may automatically move to the
notified call if the new call is of higher priority than the existing
call and automatic acceptance applies for this priority level.

### 4.2.2 On-going group calls

#### 4.2.2.1 Normal operation with successful outcome

Within each voice group call starting from the instant where the calling
service subscriber first becomes a listening service subscriber, one
service subscriber has the access at any one time to the uplink of the
voice group call channel and his speech is then broadcast on all voice
group call channel downlinks accordingly. The mobile station of the
talking service subscriber who uses the uplink of the voice group call
channel can be commanded by the network to mute or unmute the downlink
of the voice group channel when needed. The mobile station is commanded:

\- to mute the downlink in order to avoid non intelligible echoes (in
this case, the talking service subscriber can not hear dispatcher\'s
voice); and

\- to unmute the downlink in order to hear dispatcher\'s voice .

Either DTMF or the signalling option specified in ETSI TS 103 389 \[19\]
shall be used by dispatchers to trigger network signalling to mute and
un-mute the downlink of a talking service subscriber as described in
subclause 11.3.7.2.

If more than one service subscriber applies for the uplink, contention
resolution shall be performed in the network. Contention resolution
shall be performed in the group call anchor MSC.

Additionally, in order to speed up the uplink access procedure, the BSS
may grant the uplink prior to contention resolution being performed by
the group call anchor MSC. This would mean that more than one service
subscriber may access to the uplink and the respective speech may be
combined in the group call bridge and broadcast onto all voice group
call downlink channels during a transitional period. The anchor MSC
shall then select one of the talking subscribers and pre-empt the uplink
use of the other talking subscribers.

Dispatchers' voice involved shall be broadcast on the voice group call
channel downlink at any time. Mobile dispatchers are provided with a
standard link and thus with a dedicated permanent uplink different from
the voice group call channel.

All non-dispatcher group call members are provided with an indication on
the voice group call channel of whether the uplink is in use. If a
network supports the use of talker priorities, it shall indicate the
talker priority of the current talking service subscriber together with
this uplink busy indication, and repeat the uplink busy indication
periodically. When the uplink is not in use, any non-dispatcher group
call member can request access to the uplink. Any speech from
dispatchers is combined with any speech from a talking service
subscriber.

The talker priorities specified in subclause 4.2.1.1 can be included by
the mobile station in the uplink access message or priority uplink
request message and used by the network to prioritize between different
uplink requests or between an uplink request and the priority of the
current talker. A mobile station shall not include a talker priority
different from \"normal subscriber\" in the uplink access message and
shall not send a priority uplink request message, if the network has
indicated in the uplink busy message that talker priorities are not
supported.

An uplink request with talker priority \"normal subscriber\" is
signalled as an uplink request without talker priority.

If a subscriber requests for the uplink while the uplink is in use, a
mobile station supporting the use of talker priorities shall signal the
request to the network only if:

\- the subscriber is allowed to use the requested talker priority for
the respective group ID;

\- the network supports the use of talker priorities. The mobile station
shall assume that the network supports talker priorities, until the
mobile station receives an uplink busy indication containing no talker
priority information; and

\- the requested talker priority is higher than the talker priority of
the current talking service subscriber. The mobile station shall
consider the talker priority of the current talking service subscriber
to be \"normal subscriber\", until it receives an uplink busy indication
indicating the actual talker priority.

If the BSS receives an uplink access message with a talker priority
different from \"normal subscriber\", a BSS supporting the use of talker
priorities shall delay the sending of the uplink request message to the
MSC, until the MS identity, IMSI or TMSI, is received from the MS with
the subsequent layer 3 message talker indication. The BSS shall then
include in the uplink request message the layer 3 message, the requested
talker priority, and the cell identity of the cell where the uplink
access message was received.

If the BSS receives a layer 3 message priority uplink request, it shall
include the MS identity received from the MS in the uplink request
message. The BSS shall also include, in the uplink request message, the
requested talker priority and the cell identity of the cell where the
priority uplink request message was received.

The BSS shall send the uplink request message to the MSC only if the
uplink is free or if the talker priority included in the uplink access
is higher than the talker priority of the current talking service
subscriber. If the layer 3 message is transmitted in the uplink request
message, the BSS may omit the sending of the uplink request confirm
message.

In a RANflex configuration (with or without group call redundancy), if
the group call serving MSC receives an uplink request message it shall
check by analysing the NRI of the requesting subscriber\'s TMSI whether
it is the requesting subscriber\'s VMSC. If it is not, the group call
serving MSC shall retrieve the IMSI and information about subscribed
talker priorities from the VLR of the VMSC by means of the MAP service
SEND\_GROUP\_CALL\_INFO. During this MAP operation the VMSC shall check
the subscription for the group ID.

In any configuration, if the MSC receives a talker request with a talker
priority different from \"normal subscriber\" from the BSS, the MSC
shall check whether the subscriber has a subscription to use this
priority:

\- if the subscriber is allowed to use the requested priority, the
network shall disconnect the uplink allocated to the current talking
service subscriber and assign the uplink to the requesting service
subscriber;

\- otherwise, the network shall reject the uplink request with cause
value \"requested option not authorized\".

If a talker request with talker priority \"emergency subscriber\" is
received from a subscriber who has a subscription to use this priority,
the network shall additionally set the emergency mode and signal the
emergency mode indication

\- to the listeners of the group call, and

\- to the other group members in the group call area with the group ID
active, regardless whether they are in idle mode or dedicated mode, or
participate in a different group call,

until the emergency mode is reset by a subscriber with a specific
subscription to do this. If the uplink is busy then the indication to
the listeners shall be given periodically every T1 seconds. The
emergency mode indication has no influence on the talker priority
handling.

If a subscriber requests to reset of the emergency mode, a mobile
station supporting the use of talker priorities shall send an uplink
access message or priority uplink request message indicating \"emergency
mode reset request\" only if

\- the subscriber has a subscription for this request for the respective
group ID; and

\- the network indicates that the emergency mode is set.

If the BSS receives an uplink access message with an \"emergency mode
reset request\", a BSS supporting the use of talker priorities shall
wait until the MS provides the MS identity, IMSI or TMSI, with the
subsequent layer 3 message talker indication. Then the BSS shall send an
emergency reset indication to the MSC including the layer 3 message and
the cell identity of the cell where the uplink access message was
received.

If the BSS receives a layer 3 message priority uplink request, it shall
include the MS identity received from the MS in the emergency reset
indication. The BSS shall also include, in the emergency reset
indication message, the cell identity of the cell where the priority
uplink request message was received.

If the MSC receives an emergency reset indication from the BSS, the MSC
shall check whether the subscriber has a subscription for this request.
If so, the network shall:

\- stop sending the emergency mode indication; and

\- set the talker priority to \"normal subscriber\", if the uplink
status is uplink busy with talker priority \"emergency subscriber\".

If the subscriber has no subscription for the request or if the
emergency mode is not set, then the MSC shall discard the request.

The receipt of an \"emergency mode reset request\" does not trigger a
talker change.

If more than one service subscriber applies for the uplink, the one with
the highest talker priority shall be accepted. An uplink access message
or priority uplink request message with an \"emergency mode reset
request\" shall be treated with higher priority than any uplink request
with talker priority \"normal subscriber\", \"privileged subscriber\" or
\"emergency subscriber\". If several requests with the same highest
priority are received, contention resolution between these requests
shall be performed in the network. For the ranking of uplink access
messages by the BSC, if the network additionally supports the transfer
of time-critical application-specific data, see subclause 4.2.8.2.2 a.

Contention resolution shall be performed by the BSC, relay MSC or anchor
MSC which is the first to detect that more than one request with the
same highest priority was received. An MSC performing contention
resolution shall select the service subscriber whose request was
received first by the MSC and pre-empt the uplink use of the other
service subscribers. For contention resolution performed by the BSC see
subclause 11.3.7.1.

Mobile stations shall support the reception of additional information
related to the current talking service subscriber. The transmission of
additional information is optional for the network. If additional
information is provided, then it is periodically repeated by the network
as long as the current talking service subscriber keeps the uplink. The
additional information consists of a string of up to 17 octets and is
stored in the HLR as part of the subscription data of the subscriber.
The contents and the encoding of the additional information is operator
specific.

The release of the uplink is triggered by the user and indicated by the
mobile station to the network. The network shall then indicate to the
listening mobile stations that the uplink is free.

Mobile stations in group receive mode use the group receive mode
procedure (see 3GPP TS 43.022) to \"camp-on\" in a new cell to be able
to listen to the group call channel. The mobile station may find the
voice group call channel details of a new cell on the related NCH.

A network may decide not to establish voice group call channels in all
cells. Instead, notifications containing no channel description may be
provided. If a mobile station moves to such a cell, it must establish a
dedicated connection and respond to the notification by use of the
notification response procedure in order to receive the voice group
call. The network may then establish a voice group call channel and
inform the mobile station on the channel position.

If the uplink reply procedure is applicable for the voice group call,
the network may obtain knowledge on whether mobile stations are
listening in a cell by sending an uplink access request (perform uplink
reply procedure) in an uplink free message on the voice group call
channel downlink when no talking service subscriber is present in the
cell. Mobile stations receiving such a request shall use uplink reply
procedure and send uplink access bursts on the voice group call channel
uplink with the establishment cause \"reply on uplink access request\".
If no uplink access bursts are received by the network, the network may
decide to release the voice group call channel in that cell and then
provide notifications containing no channel description.

NOTE: Concerning security aspects, whilst authentication and membership
checking of mobile call originators and of mobile uplink users can be
carried out, it is not possible to authenticate service subscribers in
group receive mode if they have not before established a dedicated
connection to respond to a notification. No equivalent of a group
\"TMSI\" is provided to protect the \"identity\" of established voice
group calls.

The network may decide to reconfigure an existing voice group call's
physical channel configuration, frequencies and/or hopping sequences as
well as the cell channel description. For the cell in which the group
call is being reconfigured, the network informs any listeners in group
receive mode and any talker in group transmit mode of the change in VGCS
channel description by using the VGCS reconfiguration procedure (see
3GPP TS 44.018 \[5\]). Mobile stations on receipt of the VBS/VGCS
reconfiguration messages shall remain on the existing group channel
until indicated starting time and then apply the new configuration to
the VGCS call that the mobile station is currently involved in.

#### 4.2.2.2 Exceptional procedures

When a talking subscriber\'s mobile station loses contact with the
network, the network must detect this loss and set the uplink free so
that other mobile stations may access the uplink. The talking
subscriber\'s mobile station which has lost the contact with the network
shall return immediately to the group receive mode.

If a mobile station in group receive mode indicates a failure due to
radio link time-out, the mobile station shall behave as specified in
3GPP TS 45.008 and go back to idle mode, possibly in another cell, as
determined by the cell re-selection algorithm. If a notification is
received for the same call, the mobile station shall try to reconnect.

### 4.2.3 Leaving of a group call without termination

A service subscriber can leave the voice group call at any point by
\"deselecting\" it via an MMI function. Having deselected the voice
group call the mobile station returns to idle mode and \"ignores\" any
further notification messages related to that voice group call.

NOTE: If a service subscriber does not wish to participate in calls to a
particular group ID for long periods of time, the group ID shall be
switched to deactive state by the subscriber.

The service subscriber shall have the capability to reselect the voice
group call. The mobile station shall not ignore notification messages to
that call any more.

The dispatcher shall be able to leave a voice group call without
terminating it.

### 4.2.4 Group call termination

A voice group call can only be terminated by the calling service
subscriber, by calling dispatcher, by an entitled dispatcher or due to
no activity timer expiry (see subclauses 8.1.2.3 and 11.3.2.3).

The calling service subscriber can terminate the call only if he has
access to the uplink. He shall remain the calling service subscriber
during the length of the particular voice group call even if he leaves
the call and then returns to it later.

An entitled dispatcher can terminate the call at any time by using a
network-defined user operation (via DTMF or the signalling option
specified in ETSI TS 103 389 \[19\]).

### 4.2.5 Acknowledgements

The acknowledgement is an application option.

For voice group calls which are identified by an acknowledgement flag
mobile stations which have acknowledgement facilities have to return an
acknowledgement message with a predefined content in a predefined
manner.

The acknowledgement shall be sent using an appropriate data service, to
a predefined address or with a predefined short code stored on the
SIM/USIM card. The network may apply geographical routing to a
predefined acknowledgement service centre.

### 4.2.6 Transactions between the mobile station and the network

Mobile stations which are in group receive mode may support the
reception of short messages to voice group calls, but shall not perform
any other transactions with the network while adjusted to the voice
group call channel. They shall leave the group receive mode and act in a
standard way to perform any transaction if necessary and return to the
voice group call afterwards.

Mobile stations which have access to the voice group call channel uplink
shall not perform any transactions for supplementary services, but may
support the transmission and reception of short messages as specified in
subclause 11.3.9. \[Other features such as DTMF are under discussion.
FFS\].

### 4.2.7 Processing of originator-to-dispatcher information

The calling service subscriber may include originator-to-dispatcher
information during call setup. If the originating MSC supports
processing of originator-to-dispatcher information, it transforms the
received originator-to-dispatcher information into UUS1, and sends it:

\- if the originating MSC is not the voice group call anchor MSC: to the
voice group call anchor MSC;

\- if the originating MSC is the voice group call anchor MSC: to the
dispatchers to be attached to the group call during call setup of the
connections to these dispatchers.

The anchor MSC receiving UUS1 in a voice group call setup from an
originating relay MSC forwards this UUS1 to the dispatchers to be
attached to the group call during call setup of the connections to these
dispatchers.

**Transformation of originator-to-dispatcher information:**
Originator-to-dispatcher information can be compressed or uncompressed.

\- Decompression of compressed originator-to-dispatcher information is
specified in 3GPP TS 44.068.

\- The transformation of uncompressed originator-to-dispatcher
information into UUS1 is the UUS1 containing the same user-user IE as
the originator-to-dispatcher information.

\- The transformation of compressed originator-to-dispatcher information
into UUS1 is the UUS1 resulting from transforming the decompressed
originator-to-dispatcher information into UUS1.

### 4.2.8 Transfer of application-specific data to group call members

#### 4.2.8.1 General

Mobile stations may support the transmission of application-specific
data to other group call members or VGCS applications in the network,
and the reception of application-specific data from other group call
members or VGCS applications in the network during an ongoing voice
group call, in parallel to the voice conversation.

Service subscribers can request the transmission of application-specific
data while they are talker or listener.

Editor\'s note: The transmission and reception of application-specific
data by dispatchers is ffs.

A mobile station supporting the transmission of application-specific
data shall check with the USIM whether the subscriber is allowed to
transmit application-specific data for the respective group ID before
starting the signalling procedures specified in subsclause 4.2.8.

The procedure specified in the following subclauses supports the
transfer of application-specific data.

The same procedure can also be used by the receiver of
application-specific data to confirm the reception of
application-specific data.

NOTE: For the exact upper limit of application-specific data that can be
sent in a single transmission see 3GPP TS 44.018 \[5\]. The upper limit
will be chosen so that the application-specific data together with the
necessary control information fit into a single SABM frame.

The support of the transfer of application-specific data by the network
is an operator option.

The exact format of the application-specific data is out of scope of the
3GPP specifications. If roaming service subscribers from other PLMNs are
to be the supported or if a group call area includes cells from more
than one PLMN, the use of application-specific data requires
coordination between the operators.

#### 4.2.8.2 Sending of application-specific data

##### 4.2.8.2.1 By the talking service subscriber 

When application-specific data is to be sent and the talking subscriber
is allowed to transmit application-specific data for the respective
group ID, the mobile station of the talking service subscriber shall
send a **DATA INDICATION** (Application\_Data) message to the network on
the uplink of the dedicated channel or group call channel. On receipt of
the application-specific data, the network shall transmit these data to
the other group call members as specified in subclause 4.2.8.4.

NOTE: If the talker has to release the uplink before sending
application-specific data, the MS follows the procedures specified in
subclause 4.2.8.2.2.

##### 4.2.8.2.2 By a listener

When application-specific data is to be sent and the network indicates
the uplink as free, the listener shall use the group call channel uplink
for the signalling as specified in item a) below.

Otherwise, when the network does not indicate the uplink as free, the
channel to be used by the listener is indicated by the network in the
\"uplink access indication\" IE sent in periodic transmissions of the
UPLINK BUSY message. If the talking service subscriber uses the group
call channel uplink in the current cell, the RACH shall be used, see
item b) below; otherwise the group call channel uplink shall be used,
see item a) below.

**a) Sending application-specific data via the group call channel
uplink**

When application-specific data is to be sent and the listener is allowed
to transmit application-specific data for the respective group ID, the
mobile station of the listener shall send an UPLINK ACCESS message with
an appropriate establishment cause (\"UL request for sending
application-specific data\") on the group call channel uplink to the
BSS.

It is an operator option whether the BSS treats an UPLINK ACCESS message
with establishment cause \"UL request for sending application-specific
data\" with higher or lower priority than UPLINK ACCESS messages with
any other establishment cause. The same order of priorities applies to
all voice group calls in a network.If the BSS grants the uplink of the
group call channel, then the MS sends a SABM (DATA INDICATION) message
with its mobile identity and the application data to the network. The
serving BSS responds with a UA (DATA INDICATION) message and releases
the group call channel uplink. The MS returns to group receive mode.

On receipt of the DATA INDICATION message, the BSC shall add the cell
identifier of the cell where the application data were sent from and
passes the L3 information by sending the UPLINK APPLICATION DATA message
to the MSC.

On receipt the UPLINK APPLICATION DATA message, the MSC shall distribute
the data to all members of the group call (see subclause 4.2.8.4).

NOTE 1: Procedure a) is used to achieve the transfer time target for
time-critical data. If all MSCs and BSCs involved in the voice group
call support the feature \"talker channel parameter\", the \"talker
channel parameter\" can be used to ensure that the voice group call
channel uplink is available for the uplink access and the transmission
of time-critical application-specific data.

NOTE 2: In a network that is intended to support the transfer of
time-critical data, the BSS will usually be configured to treat an
uplink request for sending application-specific data with higher
priority than any other uplink requests.

**b) Sending application-specific data via the RACH**

When application-specific data is to be sent and the listener is allowed
to transmit application-specific data for the respective group ID, the
mobile station of the listener shall leave the group call and send a
CHANNEL REQUEST message with an appropriate establishment cause on the
RACH to the BSS in order to request an SDCCH. When a new layer 2
connection is established on a SDCCH channel the data can be sent by the
mobile station to the network with the **DATA INDICATION 2** message on
the main DCCH (figure 7j).

In order to indicate to the network which group call the
application-specific data is addressed to, the **DATA INDICATION 2**
message shall include the group call reference.

On receipt of the DATA INDICATION 2 message the BSC shall add the cell
identifier of the cell from which the application data was sent and pass
the L3 information in the UPLINK APPLICATION DATA message to the MSC.

On receipt of the UPLINK APPLICATION DATA message, the MSC shall
distribute the data to all members of the group call (see subclause
4.2.8.4).

#### 4.2.8.3 Sending a confirmation of receipt of application-specific data

On receiving application-specific data, any service subscriber can send
a confirmation to the network which will send the confirmation to the
ongoing group call.

For the purpose of identifying the received data, the confirmation shall
include the data\_id which was received in the message that contained
the application data that is being confirmed.

The further proceeding is as described in 4.2.8.2.1 and 4.2.8.2.2 (see
also figure 7i).

#### 4.2.8.4 Distributing application-specific data to a voice group call

##### 4.2.8.4.1 Distribution via the MSC

On receipt of the UPLINK APPLICATION DATA, the MSC shall check if the
sending subscriber has a subscription to the group ID. If yes, the MSC
shall distribute the application-specific data dependent on the
distribution parameter included in the DATA INDICATION or DATA
INDICATION 2 message; otherwise the MSC shall discard the UPLINK
APPLICATION DATA message.

Without a RANflex configuration, the MSC can perform this check locally
with its own VLR. In a RANflex configuration with or without group call
redundancy, if the group call serving MSC receives an UPLINK APPLICATION
DATA message it shall check by analysing the NRI of the requesting
subscriber\'s TMSI whether it is the requesting subscriber\'s VMSC. If
it is not, the group call serving MSC shall retrieve the IMSI and
information about subscribed talker priorities from the VLR of the VMSC
by means of the MAP service SEND\_GROUP\_CALL\_INFO. During this MAP
operation the VMSC shall check the subscription for the group ID.

If the application-specific data are to be sent to the listeners and the
talking service subscriber, the MSC shall proceed as follows:

If the MSC is the anchor MSC, it shall put the application data and
optionally the mobile subscriber\'s MSISDN into the BSSMAP message
NOTIFICATION DATA and distribute the message towards all relay MSCs and
all BSSs in its MSC area involved in the group call (figure 7f). If the
MSC receives an indication from the originating BSC that the
application-specific data were immediately distributed to the
originating BSS area (see subclause 4.2.8.4.2), the **MSC shall not send
the** BSSMAP message NOTIFICATION DATA **to the originating BSS.**

If the MSC is a relay MSC, it shall put the application data and
optionally the mobile subscriber\'s MSISDN into the BSSMAP message
NOTIFICATION DATA and distribute the message to the anchor MSC and all
BSSs of the relay MSC area. If the MSC receives an indication from the
originating BSC that the application-specific data were immediately
distributed to the originating BSS area (see subclause 4.2.8.4.2), the
**MSC shall not send the** BSSMAP message NOTIFICATION DATA **to the
originating BSS.** On receiving the NOTIFICATION DATA message from the
relay MSC, the anchor MSC shall send the message towards all BSSs in its
MSC area involved in the group call and to all relay MSCs except the
relay MSC from which the NOTIFICATION DATA was received (figure 7h). The
BSS shall broadcast the notification data to all listeners and talking
service subscriber in the NOTIFICATION APPLICATION DATA message on the
FACCH.

The network may repeat the NOTIFY APPLICATION DATA message for
application-specific data on the group call channel downlink. If a
mobile station receives the NOTIFY APPLICATION DATA message more than
once, it shall deliver only the first received message to its local
application and discard any received repetitions of the message.

The mechanism how the mobile station detects a repetition of the NOTIFY
APPLICATION DATA message is application- specific.

Editor\'s note: The sending of application-specific data to other
destinations (e.g. dispatchers or applications) is ffs.

##### 4.2.8.4.2 Immediate distribution by the BSC

As a network option, on receipt of application-specific data from the
MS, the BSS may distribute the application-specific data immediately to
the cells within the BSC area belonging to the group call area, if the
**distribution parameter included in the DATA INDICATION message or DATA
INDICATION 2 message indicates that the application-specific data are to
be sent to the service subscribers**. **In addition, the BSC shall send
the application-specific data to the MSC with an indication that the
application-specific data were already distributed to the originating
BSC area.**

When this network option is used, the BSS cannot include the mobile
subscriber\'s MSISDN in the NOTIFY APPLICATION DATA message broadcast
immediately to the cells within the BSC area. Furthermore, the BSS
cannot check if the sending subscriber has a subscription for the group
ID.

If the network option of immediate distribution of application-specific
data by the BSS is activated, then during the establishment phase of the
voice group call the BSC shall **store the** cell identities of the
cells belonging to the group call area and served by the BSC.

NOTE: If this option is activated no subscription check by the MSC is
possible. It is also not possible to include the mobile subscriber\'s
MSISDN in the NOTIFY APPLICATION DATA message.

5 General architecture
======================

5.1 Group Call Register (GCR)
-----------------------------

The general architecture of GSM is maintained. In addition, a network
function is required which is used for registration of the group call
attributes, the Group Call Register (GCR).

The GCR function is mainly a database function, holding information
about voice group calls.

NOTE 1: The GCR implementation is not specified. It may be realized e.g.
as a new network node, in a PABX directly attached to an MSC, inside an
MSC or as an HLR. The interface between the GCR function and other
functions is not specified in the GSM technical specifications. As a
consequence, the functional split between MSC and GCR as developed in
the present document is only indicative, and other functional splits can
be implemented.

The GCR data for a specific voice group call is set at the creation of
the group call attributes, and can be subsequently modified. No support
for these functions is specified in the GSM technical specifications.

In a RANflex configuration with group call redundancy GCRs associated to
MSCs belonging to the same redundancy pool need to communicate with each
other by means of SYNC\_GCR messages.

Figure 1: Functional architecture with a Group Call Register

Note: Figure 1a shows the configuration with only one RANflex MSC pool.
Other configurations with more than one RANflex MSC pool are possible.

Figure 1a: Functional architecture with a Group Call Register in a
RANflex configuration

Note: Figure 1b shows the configuration with only one RANflex MSC pool.
Other configurations with more than one RANflex MSC pool are possible.

Figure 1b: Functional architecture with a Group Call Register in a
RANflex configuration with group call redundancy

Dashed lines in figure 1, figure 1a and figure 1b indicate MAP
interfaces, thin solid lines indicate ISUP interfaces, bold solid lines
indicate interfaces without standardized protocol.

Lines in figure 1b ending at an MSC Redundancy Pool actually connect to
the selected MSC within the redundancy pool. For MSC selection see
subclause 5.3.1.

The signalling between the entities shown in figure 1, figure 1a and
figure 1b, for the two cases of service subscriber and dispatcher
originated calls, shall be as defined in the following.

**Service subscriber originated:** The service subscriber\'s VMSC shall
perform subscription checking against VLR records. In a RANflex
configuration it shall then derive from the service subscriber\'s
current location area the address of the group call serving MSC which
may be different from the VMSC. In a RANflex configuration with group
call redundancy this address identifies a group call serving MSC
redundancy pool.

If one of the following configurations applies:

a\) no RANflex configuration;

b\) in a RANflex configuration, if the VMSC is the group call serving
MSC; or

c\) in a RANflex configuration with group call redundancy, if the VMSC
belongs to the group call serving MSC redundancy pool,

the VMSC shall consult its GCR to determine the group call attributes
related to its MSC area and whether it is the group call anchor MSC for
that voice group call. If it is not, the GCR shall provide with the
group call attributes the routing information identifying the group call
anchor MSC (the group call anchor MSC redundancy pool in a RANflex
configuration with group call redundancy) to the originating VMSC. The
originating VMSC shall then route the voice group call to the anchor
MSC.

If one of the following configurations applies:

d\) in a RANflex configuration, if the VMSC is not the group call
serving MSC; or

e\) in a RANflex configuration with group call redundancy, if the VMSC
does not belong to the group call serving MSC redundancy pool,

the VMSC shall consult the group call serving MSC by means of the MAP
service SEND\_GROUP\_CALL\_INFO and retrieve the group call anchor MSC
address. The originating VMSC shall then route the voice group call to
the anchor MSC or the anchor MSC pool.

If the initiation of the voice group call had specified
originator-to-dispatcher information and processing of
originator-to-dispatcher information is supported by the originating
VMSC, the originator-to-dispatcher information is transformed by the
originating VMSC into UUS1 and sent to the anchor MSC or the anchor MSC
pool. If the originating VMSC is the group call anchor MSC (or belongs
to the group call anchor MSC redundancy pool), along with the group call
attributes, the GCR shall provide information on all group call relay
MSCs or group call relay MSC pools to be involved.

The group call anchor MSC shall set up links to all group call relay
MSCs or relay MSC pools. It shall also initiate setup of point-to-point
connections to the dispatchers associated to the voice group call (see
subclause 8.1.2.2); if UUS1 information has been received in the
signalling for call setup from the originating VMSC, this UUS1
information is included in the setup of point-to-point connections to
the dispatchers. Each MSC involved in a voice group call obtains its own
group call attributes from the GCR related to the MSC.

The IMSI of the calling service subscriber must be provided to and
stored in the anchor MSC and each relay MSC in order to allow the
calling service subscriber to clear the group call later on.

**Dispatcher originated:** In the case of dispatchers calling from an
external network, the call request, in the form of an ISDN number, shall
be received at a GMSC. The number shall be analysed and the call shall
be directly routed to the group call anchor MSC or anchor MSC pool by
the GMSC based on the called identity without requesting an HLR. The
group call anchor MSC shall interrogate the GCR and obtain the group
call attributes. If an identical voice group call is currently in
progress, the dispatcher shall be connected to this call and no new call
shall be initiated. When interrogating the GCR, the identity of the
calling dispatcher is compared with the list of dispatchers which are
allowed to initiate the call. If the dispatcher is not in the list, or
an identity is not provided, the network shall reject the call.

NOTE 2: A dispatcher may be a user of the GSM network in which the VGCS
service is provided or may be connected to a PABX which is connected to
the MSC containing the GCR. A dispatcher which is registered in the GCR
for a certain voice group call and which also has a subscription for
VGCS with the same group ID as the voice group call for which he is
dispatcher shall deactivate this group ID when he is located in the
corresponding group call area in order to avoid conflicts between paging
for the dispatcher and notifications for the group ID.

5.2 Voice group call responsibility
-----------------------------------

The MSC responsible for the voice group call is the one nominated within
the GCR or the one to which the call is routed from the GMSC in the case
of a dispatcher originated call. This MSC is termed the group call
anchor MSC.

If the group call area extends beyond one MSC area then any MSCs
controlling cells in the area outside of the group call anchor MSC are
referred to as group call relay MSCs.

In a RANflex configuration a given location area within the pool area is
served (with group call services) by a single predefined group call
serving MSC which for a specific group call is either anchor or relay
MSC.

In a RANflex configuration with group call redundancy a given location
area within the pool area is served (with group call services) by
predefined group call serving MSCs which form up the location area\'s
group call serving MSC redundancy pool. One MSC shall not belong to more
than one group call MSC redundancy pool. For a specific ongoing group
call the group call serving redundancy pool is either an anchor or a
relay redundancy pool.

5.3 RANflex configuration with group call redundancy
----------------------------------------------------

### 5.3.1 MSC selection in a RANflex configuration with group call redundancy

In a RANflex configuration with group call redundancy, messages routed
towards a group call MSC redundancy pool eventually need to be processed
by a selected MSC out of the redundancy pool. MSC selection is done with
appropriate routing mechanisms at call setup time.

Mixed configurations where e.g. the anchor MSC belongs to an anchor MSC
redundancy pool but the relay MSC does not belong to a Relay MSC
redundancy pool may be considered a RANflex configuration with group
call redundancy where e.g. the relay MSC redundancy pool is formed up by
just one relay MSC.

In a RANflex configuration with group call redundancy the following
messages sent to an MSC do not address an individual MSC but an MSC
redundancy pool:

\- IAM (from dispatcher to Anchor MSC);

\- IAM (from VMSC to Anchor MSC);

\- SEND\_GROUP\_CALL\_INFO (from VMSC to Group Call Serving MSC);

\- PREPARE\_GROUP\_CALL (from Anchor MSC to Relay MSC); and

\- MT\_FORWARD\_SM\_FOR\_VGCS (from SMS-GMSC to Anchor MSC).

Network routing ensures that these messages are routed to one of the
available (i.e. not out of service) MSCs within the redundancy pool. MSC
selection by network routing can be based e.g. on a predefined
prioritization mechanism or a load distribution mechanism but the exact
mechanism is out of scope of this specification.

Once the message is received by one of the available MSCs, the receiving
MSC shall check whether there is the need to forward the message to
another specific MSC within the redundancy pool (for detailed behaviour
of the MSC see subclauses 11.4, 11.5, and 11.5A) . Network routing
ensures that the forwarded message is routed to the specific MSC.
Specific MSC routing may be done e.g. with address prefixes and is out
of scope of this specification.

If the message forwarding MSC detects that the specific target MSC is
out of service, it shall handle the request locally and repeat the GCR
interrogation with an override indication.

In a RANflex configuration with group call redundancy the following
messages sent to an MSC address an individual MSC and not an MSC
redundancy pool:

\- IAM (dispatcher originated) when forwarded within the group call
anchor MSC redundancy pool from selected Anchor MSC to the Anchor MSC
where the group call is on-going;

\- IAM (VMSC originated) when forwarded within the group call anchor MSC
redundancy pool from selected Anchor MSC to the Anchor MSC where the
group call is on-going;

\- IAM (from Anchor MSC to Relay MSC) routed with the temporary group
call number allocated by the Relay MSC;

\- SEND\_GROUP\_CALL\_INFO (VMSC originated) when forwarded within the
group call serving MSC redundancy pool from selected group call serving
MSC to the group call serving MSC where the group call is on-going;

\- Subsequent messages within a dialogue opened by a
PREPARE\_GROUP\_CALL message (PREPARE\_GROUP\_CALL\_ACK,
SEND\_GROUP\_CALL\_END\_SIGNAL, FORWARD\_GROUP\_CALL\_SIGNALLING;
PROCESS\_GROUP\_CALL\_SIGNALLING). MAP dialogue handling ensures that
messages are exchanged between origin and selected destination of the
dialogue; and

\- MT\_FORWARD\_SM\_FOR\_VGCS (SMS-GMSC originated) when forwarded
within the group call anchor MSC redundancy pool from selected Anchor
MSC to the Anchor MSC where the group call is on-going.

Network routing ensures that these messages are routed to the individual
MSC within the redundancy pool.

5.3.2 GCR synchronization in a RANflex configuration with group call redundancy
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

GCRs associated to MSCs which belong to the same redundancy pool need to
synchronize their transient data. This is done by means of SYNC\_GCR
messages. As soon as transient data are modified in a GCR as a result of
GCR interrogation from the associated MSC, the modification is
propagated to the other GCRs.

This mechanism prevents the establishment of two simultaneous group
calls with the same group call reference controlled by two different
anchor MSCs.

5.3.3 GCR Restoration in a RANflex configuration with group call redundancy
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

When a GCR (and its associated MSC) restarts after planned or unplanned
outage, its transient data may be lost or may be out of sync due to lost
SYNC\_GCR messages. To restore the transient data, the GCR shall after
restart

\- stop all T3 timers;

\- delete all stored initial talker information; and

\- mark all GCR records with \"transient data not reliable\".

When transient data are read while processing a GCR interrogation, the
GCR shall check whether the record is marked \"transient data not
reliable\". If so, the GCR shall retrieve transient data from the other
GCR(s) within the redundancy pool by means of a SYNC\_GCR message with
request indication, store it and reset the mark \"transient data not
reliable\" before processing the GCR interrogation. If the retrieval of
transient data is unsuccessful, the GCR shall assume that the call is
not on-going, reset the mark \"transient data not reliable\" and process
the GCR interrogation.

When processing a received SYNC\_GCR message without request indication
while the record is marked \"transient data not reliable\", the GCR
shall accept the request and reset the \"transient data not reliable\"
mark.

When processing a received SYNC\_GCR message with request indication
while the record is marked \"transient data not reliable\", the GCR
shall return a negative response (failure) and keep the \"transient data
not reliable\" mark.

6 Compatibility issues
======================

VGCS can not be used with standard Phase 1 or Phase 2 mobile stations. A
dedicated mobile station with VGCS capability is required.

A mobile station with VGCS capability shall also provide the complete
functionality in order to allow the use of Phase 2 services.

Standard Phase 1 and Phase 2 mobile stations in a network shall not be
impacted by the presence of VGCS services in that network due to VGCS
signalling, also if the mobile station is operated with a SIM/USIM of a
VGCS service subscriber.

7 Transmission
==============

7.1 Transmission architecture
-----------------------------

A conference bridge is required to connect the transmission paths of the
nominated cells. The bridge is to be located within the group call
anchor MSC.

Without a RANflex configuration: The group call anchor MSC is
responsible for setting up all connections, both to the nominated cells
(voice group call channels) in the group call anchor MSC and to any
related group call relay MSC, and to the dispatchers. Except when a
calling service subscriber, served by a relay MSC, is on the initial
dedicated link, there shall be one link towards every relay MSC and a
distribution function in the relay MSCs and from there one link per cell
within the group call relay MSC which is involved in the voice group
call.

In a RANflex configuration: The group call anchor MSC is responsible for
setting up all connections, both to those cells of the group call area
that belong to a location area for which the group call anchor MSC is
the group call serving MSC and to any related group call relay MSC, and
to the dispatchers. Except when a calling service subscriber, served by
a relay MSC, is on the initial dedicated link, there shall be one link
towards every relay MSC and a distribution function in the relay MSCs
and from there one link per cell of the group call area that belongs to
a location area for which the group call relay MSC is the group call
serving MSC which is involved in the voice group call.

In a RANflex configuration with group call redundancy: The group call
anchor MSC selected from the anchor MSC redundancy pool is responsible
for setting up all connections, both to those cells of the group call
area that belong to a location area for which the group call anchor MSC
is the group call serving MSC and to any related group call relay MSC
pool, and to the dispatchers. Except when a calling service subscriber,
served by a relay MSC, is on the initial dedicated link, there shall be
one link towards every relay MSC redundancy pool and a distribution
function in the selected relay MSCs and from there one link per cell of
the group call area that belongs to a location area for which the group
call relay MSC is the group call serving MSC which is involved in the
voice group call.

For all configurations the following applies:

While the calling service subscriber is on a dedicated link served by
his VMSC, there is an additional link from the anchor MSC to the VMSC
serving the calling service subscriber and an additional link from the
VMSC serving the calling service subscriber to the cell serving the
calling service subscriber. There shall be no secondary bridges in BSCs.

While a talker served by a relay MSC is on any other dedicated or group
channel than the initial dedicated channel , the following applies: The
distribution function shall be implemented using a secondary conference
bridge at the relay MSC so that VGCS talker speech sent on the current
channel uplink is transmitted to local relay cells as well as being
transmitted over the link back to the anchor MSC, for distribution to
the rest of the network, dispatchers and nominated cells at other relay
MSCs.

The conference bridge shall not mute the uplink speech.

7.1a Transmission architecture -- A interface circuit sharing
-------------------------------------------------------------

7.1a.1 Transmission architecture -- General
-------------------------------------------

The MSC and BSC shall negotiate during the setup of a voice group call
whether A-interface circuit sharing is supported by both entities. When
this optional feature is supported by both entities, the same
A-interface circuit can be shared for all cells belonging to a BSC for a
given voice group call. When AoIP is used, the same AoIP transport layer
information can be shared for all cells belonging to a BSC for a given
voice group call.

A conference bridge is required to connect the transmission paths of the
nominated cells. The bridge is to be located within the group call
anchor MSC. The group call anchor MSC is responsible for setting up all
connections, both to the nominated cells (voice group call channels) in
the group call anchor MSC and in any related group call relay MSC, and
to the dispatchers

The BSC contains a distribution function that distributes speech sent
from the MSC to each of the nominated cells.

### 7.1a.2 Transmission architecture -- Control Plane

The control plane signalling shall be the same as in sub-clause 7.1.

### 7.1a.3 Transmission architecture -- User Plane

In the case of an originator that is not on the initial dedicated link,
there shall be one link from the anchor MSC towards every relay MSC.
There will be one link from each of these relay MSCs and the group call
anchor MSC to each BSC controlled by the respective MSC and involved in
the voice group call. Each of these BSCs contains a distribution
function that distributes speech received from the MSC to each cell
involved in the group call.

When an originator, served by a relay MSC, is on the initial dedicated
link, there is an additional link from the anchor MSC to the relay MSC
serving the originator and an additional link from the relay MSC serving
the originator to the cell serving the originator.

When an originator, served by an anchor MSC, is on the initial dedicated
link, there shall be one link from the anchor MSC towards every relay
MSC. There will be one link from each of these MSCs and the group call
anchor MSC to each BSC controlled by the respective MSC and involved in
the voice group call. Each of these BSCs contains a distribution
function, with one link to each cell and involved in the group call.
There is an additional link from the anchor MSC to the cell serving the
originator.

While a talker served by an anchor MSC is on any other dedicated or
group channel than the initial dedicated channel, the following
distribution functions shall be implemented:

\- conference bridge at the anchor MSC so that VGCS talker speech sent
on the current channel uplink is transmitted to local cells as well as
being transmitted over the links to the relay MSCs, for distribution to
the rest of the network, dispatchers and nominated cells at other relay
MSCs;

\- distribution point at the BSC so that speech sent from the MSC is
distributed to each of the nominated cells.

While a talker served by a relay MSC is on any other dedicated or group
channel than the initial dedicated channel, the following distribution
functions shall be implemented:

\- secondary conference bridge at the relay MSC so that VGCS talker
speech sent on the current channel uplink is transmitted to local cells
as well as being transmitted over the link back to the anchor MSC, for
distribution to the rest of the network, dispatchers and nominated cells
at other relay MSCs;

\- distribution point at the BSC so that speech sent from the MSC is
distributed to each of the nominated cells.

The conference bridge shall not mute the uplink speech.

### 7.1b Transmission architecture -- A interface link sharing

7.1b.1 Transmission architecture -- General
-------------------------------------------

The MSC and BSC shall negotiate during the setup of a voice group call
whether A-interface link sharing is supported by both entities. When
this optional feature is supported by both entities, the same
A-interface link (user and control plane) can be shared for all cells
belonging to a BSC for a given voice group call.

A conference bridge is required to connect the transmission paths of the
nominated cells. The bridge is to be located within the group call
anchor MSC. The group call anchor MSC is responsible for setting up a
single A-interface link (i.e. either A-interface circuit or A interface
IP address and UDP port value in case of AoIP and resource controlling
SCCP connection) to each BSC containing nominated cells in the group
call anchor MSC and links to any group call relay MSCs and to the
dispatchers.

Each BSC is responsible for setting up a speech and signalling
connection (voice group call channel) to each nominated cell in the
group call area served by this BSC. The BSC contains a distribution
function that distributes speech and resource control related signalling
from the MSC to each of the nominated cells.

### 7.1b.2 Transmission architecture -- Control Plane

The MSC shall inform the BSC of the cells required to be setup for the
group call in the VGCS ASSIGMENT REQUEST. This message shall contain the
list of group call area cells served by this BSC. If the entire list of
cell identifiers does not fit into the message or if different methods
of radio resource allocation (e.g. \"immediate allocation\"or \"delay
allowed\") are to be used for different cells controlled by the BSC, the
MSC shall send one or more VGCS AREA CELL INFO messages containing the
remaining cell identifiers or the cell identifiers of cells using a
different method of radio resource allocation. Once a channel could be
established to the cell of origin or, if the cell of origin is not
served by this BSC, to any other cell, the VGCS ASSIGMENT RESULT shall
be sent to the MSC and timer Tast shall be started. Timer Tast is used
to measure the duration between periodic reports from the BSC to the MSC
of group call area cells for which channels have been assigned or
released since the last periodic report. When timer Tast expires, if new
cells in the group call area have been established or existing ones have
been released, pre-empted or failed, the MSC shall be informed of the
changes. If no changes have taken place nothing shall be sent. Timer
Tast shall be started again to measure the period of time until the next
report. The timer shall be stopped when the call is released.

Once all cells for a given group call area served by a BSC are
established this BSC shall immediately send a VGCS ASSIGNMENT\_STATUS
message to the MSC indicating this and restart timer Tast. This
information shall be used by the MSC to determine the conditions for
call set up as described in subclause 11.3.1.1.2.

The BSS is responsible to establish the channel to the different cells
and manage the signalling accordingly (e.g. HO decisions, pre-emption,
re-establishment of cells, priority uplink decision). The A-interface
link (user and control plane) between MSC and BSC shall only be released
when the call is released.

When the network supports uplink access option (i) as defined in
subclause 7.2 (i.e. indication in uplink busy instructs the MS to use
the group call channel to send the uplink access message if the talker
on the group call channel is not in the same cell as the MS) the network
shall include talker priority information in all relevant A-interface
messages on the resource controlling SCCP connection, to distinguish
between messages related to the current talker and messages related to
the subscriber requesting the uplink.

### 7.1b.3 Transmission architecture -- User Plane

The transmission architecture of the user plane as specified in
subclause 7.1a.3 applies.

7.2 Radio channels
------------------

In each cell of the group call area one voice group call channel may be
established consisting of a downlink received by all service
subscribers' mobile stations and an uplink which shall be used by the
talking subscriber\'s mobile station only.

If the network allocates a dedicated traffic channel for the calling
service subscriber, his mobile station shall use the dedicated standard
uplink/downlink which is connected to the conference bridge up to the
instant where the network decides that the mobile station shall join the
voice group call channel and the dedicated connection is released.

The network may decide to switch a talking subscriber\'s mobile station
from the voice group call channel to a dedicated standard
uplink/downlink at any time. The talking subscriber\'s voice group call
channel and the dedicated channel may belong to different cells within
the group call area, i.e. the network may request the talker to perform
a handover. The dedicated connection shall then be maintained up to the
instance where the network decides that the mobile station shall join
the voice group call channel again and the dedicated connection is
released.

When the network indicates the uplink as free, the mobile station uses
the group call channel uplink to signal an uplink request, \"emergency
mode reset request\" or uplink request for sending application-specific
data.

When the network does not indicate the uplink as free, there are two
options for the mobile station how to signal an uplink request with
talker priority higher than \"normal subscriber\", an \"emergency mode
reset request\" or an uplink request for sending application-specific
data:

i\) if the priority uplink access parameter broadcast on the NCH
indicates \"RACH access\" but the latest UPLINK BUSY message received in
the cell indicates that the group call channel uplink shall be used, the
mobile station sends an uplink access message on the group call channel
uplink; otherwise, the mobile station temporarily leaves the group
receive mode and sends a channel request message on the RACH. Once a
dedicated connection has been established by the network, the mobile
station sends a layer 3 message PRIORITY UPLINK REQUEST or DATA
INDICATION 2. The PRIORITY UPLINK REQUEST message contains the MS
identity (IMSI or TMSI), the group call reference, random reference, the
type of request and the token broadcast by the BSS, if the BSS
broadcasts a token. On receipt of this information, the network shall
release the dedicated connection, and the mobile station shall return to
the group receive mode and continue to listen on the downlink of the
group call channel for further instructions from the network.

NOTE 1: The indication in uplink busy instructs the MS to use the group
call channel uplink to send the uplink access message if the talker on
the group call channel is not in the same cell as the MS.

If the mobile station releases the uplink on request of the subscriber,
it shall use the group call channel uplink for signalling subsequent
uplink requests, until it performs a cell change or receives either an
UPLINK BUSY message indicating that RACH shall be used or a VGCS UPLINK
GRANT message destined for a different mobile station.

ii\) If the priority uplink access parameter broadcast on the NCH
indicates \"group call channel uplink access\" then the mobile station
always sends an uplink access message on the group call channel uplink.
If this option is used, the network shall always establish and maintain
a dedicated channel for the talking service subscriber.

NOTE 2: Otherwise, with option (ii) the BSC would not be able to detect
the requests of higher privileged talkers in the cell where the current
talking service subscriber is located.

Support of both options is mandatory for a mobile station supporting the
use of talker priorities or transfer of application-specific data and
optional for the network. A network supporting the use of talker
priorities or transfer of time-critical application-specific data shall
indicate the default procedure to be used on the NCH (i.e. either \"RACH
access\" or \"group call channel uplink access\"). The indication shall
have the same value throughout the network. If the \"talker channel
parameter\" is used in a network, then the value of the indication shall
be set to \"RACH access\".

A listening subscriber\'s mobile station which responds to a
notification because no description of the voice group call channel was
provided in the notification may be assigned a dedicated standard
uplink/downlink up to the instant where the radio access network decides
that the mobile station shall join the voice group call channel and the
dedicated connection is released.

Voice group call channels shall be standard full rate or half rate
speech channels, EFR speech channels, full rate AMR speech or half rate
AMR speech channels. The support of voice group call channels other than
full rate speech is a network option. A specific voice group call can
use either the same speech codec type in all cells of the group call
area or different speech codec types in different cells of the group
call area. Those implementations are optional for the network operator.

When establishing an AMR half rate or AMR full rate speech channel, the
BSC shall select a suitable AMR codec configuration:

\- for a dedicated channel used by a talking service subscriber, the BSC
may select any configuration permitted for a point-to-point call;

\- for a voice group call channel the BSC shall select one of the
preferred configurations as defined in 3GPP TS 28.062 \[16\],
Table 7.11.3.1.3-2. For the downlink the BSC shall disable the rate
adaptation mechanism and apply a single codec mode until the channel is
released. If the talking service subscriber uses the voice group call
channel uplink and the BSC selected a multi-mode configuration, the BSC
shall apply the rate adaptation mechanism for the uplink.

> Within a cell the BSC shall select the same codec configuration for
> all voice group and voice broadcast calls using the same AMR codec
> type, AMR FR or AMR HR, respectively. The selected configuration shall
> be broadcast on the NCH, as long as at least one voice group or voice
> broadcast call using the respective AMR codec type is active.

When A-interface circuit sharing or A-interface link sharing applies
there is one A-interface circuit allocated for the group call per BSC.
In case of AoIP, there is one A-interface IP and port allocated for the
group call per BSC. Therefore the same speech codec is applied for all
voice group channels in the part of the group call area served by one
BSC if the TRAU is located between the MSC and the BSC-internal
distribution function for speech (see subclause 7.1a.1 and 7.1b.1).

Mobile station using the uplink are in group transmit mode. Signalling
for this RR mode is specified in 3GPP TS 44.018. Mobile stations not
using the uplink and not in dedicated mode shall ignore any signalling
concerned only with uplink usage.

Full standard duplex channels shall be provided to all dispatchers
listed in the GCR. These may be provided either via GSM, or via an
external network. The links to the dispatchers are connected to the
conference bridge.

If the mobile station of the talking service subscriber joins the voice
group call channel, it will transmit on the uplink of the voice group
call channel.

7.3 Data confidentiality
------------------------

Data confidentiality on the radio can be provided as a network option.

If data confidentiality is provided, both the uplink and the downlink of
the voice group call channel within a cell of the group call area shall
be ciphered using voice group ciphering keys derived from the same group
key, see 3GPP TS 43.020 \[10\].

The group key is related to the group ID. For each group ID, there is a
number of group keys stored on the USIM which are identified by a group
key number. The group key number identifying the group key to be used
for a particular voice group call is provided with the notification to
the mobile stations. Mobile stations which have a dedicated connection
shall be informed of the group key number before they join the voice
group call channel.

USIM based VGCS ciphering uses a concept of short term keys where the
short term key is derived by the GCR and the USIM from the group key and
a RAND (random number) parameter. The actual voice group ciphering key
is then derived by the BSS and the ME from the short term key, the cell
global identifier, and a Cell Global Count parameter.

To include a subscriber into a voice group the required group data
(including the 2 master group keys) shall be stored on the USIM, e.g.
during the personalisation process or via OTA (over-the-air). To exclude
a subscriber from a voice group the group data shall be deleted from the
USIM. If a USIM is lost or stolen, all USIMs of the remaining members of
the voice groups that this USIM is a member of need to be changed (e.g.
via OTA or manual provisioning).

Details on data confidentiality for voice group calls are provided in
3GPP TS 42.009 \[9\]and 3GPP TS 43.020 \[10\].

NOTE 1: USIM based VGCS ciphering is not compatible with SIM based VGCS
ciphering which has not been completely specified. The SIM
specifications contain no support for the storage of the group keys. A
pre-Rel-6 VGCS capable mobile station will be able to participate in an
un-ciphered group call, if it is part of that group.

If data confidentiality is provided, then for a mobile station in group
mode dedicated channel the uplink and the downlink of the dedicated
channel shall be ciphered using the individual ciphering key of the
service subscriber.

NOTE 2: The individual ciphering key is the key generated during a
previous authentication procedure.

In order to start the ciphering for the calling service subscriber, the
MSC serving the mobile station shall initiate a cipher mode control
procedure during call setup, while the mobile station is in group mode
dedicated channel. When ciphering was started successfully, the mobile
station shall apply the individual ciphering key until it leaves group
mode dedicated channel or a new cipher mode control procedure is
performed successfully.

In order to start the ciphering on the dedicated channel, if the network
decides to move a talking subscriber\'s mobile station from group
transmit mode to group mode dedicated channel, the network shall include
cipher mode setting information in the assignment command or handover
command message (see 3GPP TS 43.020 \[10\], Annex F 3.2). On the
dedicated channel the mobile station shall apply the individual
ciphering key until it leaves group mode dedicated channel or a new
cipher mode control procedure is performed successfully.

If data confidentiality is provided, then for a mobile dispatcher the
uplink and the downlink of the dedicated channel shall be ciphered using
the individual ciphering key of the dispatcher.

If data confidentiality is provided, the priority uplink request
procedure can be validated by a handshake between the requesting MS and
the BSS. A32 bit token is generated randomly and broadcast by the BSS on
the ciphered downlink of the voice group call channel and stored in the
MS. When the MS sends a priority uplink request it includes the token as
a parameter and the BSS checks this against its stored value. If it
matches the request is processed further. If it does not match, the
request is ignored. A new token is broadcast on the ciphered downlink of
the voice group call channel each time a match occurs and each time a
periodic UPLINK\_BUSY message is sent (i.e. every T1 seconds) (refer to
Figure 7e in section 11.3.8).

If data confidentiality is provided for point-to-point SMS over the CS
domain, the network shall broadcast an SMS data confidentiality
indication in NOTIFICATION/ NCH messages, NOTIFICATION/ FACCH messages
and in the Connect message sent to the calling service subscriber of a
voice group call.

If guaranteed privacy is provided for SMS over the CS domain (see 3GPP
TS 42.068 \[2\]), the network shall broadcast an SMS guaranteed privacy
indication in NOTIFICATION/ NCH messages, NOTIFICATION/ FACCH messages
and in the Connect message sent to the calling service subscriber of a
voice group call.

NOTE 3: For backward compatibility with legacy networks the coding of
these indications in NOTIFICATION messages is chosen so that the default
settings are SMS data confidentiality = \"on\" and SMS guaranteed
privacy = \"on\".

8 Information storage
=====================

8.1 Information stored in the GCR
---------------------------------

### 8.1.1 Information used for routing of service subscriber originated voice group calls

Without a RANflex configuration, the GCR shall hold for a related MSC
area for each group ID and cell from which voice group calls can be
established by service subscribers the group call reference to be used
for a voice group call to be established and an indication whether the
originating MSC is the group call anchor MSC.

In a RANflex configuration, the GCR shall hold for a related MSC area
(i.e. for those location areas for which the related MSC is the group
call serving MSC) for each group ID and cell (within those location
areas for which the related MSC is the group call serving MSC) from
which voice group calls can be established by service subscribers the
group call reference to be used for a voice group call to be established
and an indication whether the group call serving MSC is the group call
anchor MSC.

In a RANflex configuration with group call redundancy, the GCR shall
hold for a related MSC area (i.e. for those location areas for which the
related MSC belongs to the group call serving MSC redundancy pool) for
each group ID and cell (within those location areas for which the
related MSC can act as the group call serving MSC) from which voice
group calls can be established by service subscribers the group call
reference to be used for a voice group call to be established and an
indication whether the group call serving MSC belongs to the group call
anchor MSC redundancy pool.

If one of the following configurations applies:

a\) without a RANflex configuration;

b\) in a RANflex configuration, if the VMSC is the group call serving
MSC; or

c\) in a RANflex configuration with group call redundancy, if the VMSC
belongs to the group call serving MSC redundancy pool:

If the VMSC is the group call anchor MSC or belongs to the group call
anchor MSC redundancy pool, the GCR shall provide the group call
attributes related to that group call reference as defined in
subclause 8.1.2 and 8.1.3 to the VMSC and the VMSC shall establish the
voice group call.

If the VMSC is not the anchor MSC or does not belong to the group call
anchor MSC redundancy pool, the GCR shall provide the group call
reference plus the routing information identifying the anchor MSC or
anchor MSC redundancy pool to the VMSC and the VMSC shall route the
voice group call to the anchor MSC or anchor MSC redundancy pool.

If the following configuration applies:

d\) in a RANflex configuration, if the VMSC is different from the group
call serving MSC:

If the group call serving MSC is a relay MSC for the group call, the GCR
shall provide the group call reference plus the routing information
identifying the anchor MSC to the group call serving MSC which passes
this information to the VMSC.

If the group call serving MSC is the anchor MSC for the group call, the
GCR shall provide the group call reference to the group call serving MSC
which adds the routing information identifying the anchor MSC (i.e. its
own MSC address) and passes the information to the VMSC.

Then the VMSC shall route the voice group call to the anchor MSC.

If the following configuration applies:

e\) in a RANflex configuration with group call redundancy, if the VMSC
does not belong to the group call serving MSC redundancy pool:

If the group call serving MSC redundancy pool is a group call relay MSC
redundancy pool for the group call, the GCR shall provide the group call
reference plus the routing information identifying the anchor MSC
redundancy pool to the requesting group call serving MSC which passes
this information to the VMSC.

If the group call serving MSC redundancy pool is the group call anchor
MSC redundancy pool for the group call, the GCR shall provide the group
call reference to the requesting group call serving MSC which adds the
routing information identifying the anchor MSC redundancy pool and
passes the information to the VMSC.

Then the VMSC shall route the voice group call to the anchor MSC
redundancy pool.

In a RANflex configuration with group call redundancy, the GCR shall
provide the requesting MSC with \"group call ongoing information\". If
the group call is ongoing at another MSC within the redundancy pool, the
requesting MSC shall forward the actual request to that MSC.

NOTE: In case the GCR function is distributed over different physical
entities, each may hold only the information needed to treat requests
coming from the MSCs connected to the physical GCR entity.

### 8.1.2 Static Group call attributes

The GCR stores a list of static Group Call Attributes for a given group
call reference. These lists shall be programmed by the service provider
at registration of the network specific service configuration. In
RANflex configurations with group call redundancy these lists shall be
identical in GCRs which are associated to MSCs belonging to the same
redundancy pool.

The contents of each list related to requests of the group call anchor
MSC is as follows:

\- a list of cells inside the MSC area of the group call anchor MSC (in
a RANflex configuration with or without group call redundancy, the cells
belonging to a location area for which the group call anchor MSC is the
group call serving MSC) into which the call is to be sent (part of the
group call area), see subclause 8.1.2.1;

\- a list of group call relay MSCs (or group call relay MSC redundancy
pools) into which the call is to be sent;

\- information on the cipher algorithm and the group key to be used for
this voice group call;

\- information on the codecs allowed for this voice group call. As an
operator option, the EFR codec, standard half rate codec, AMR half rate
codec, and AMR full rate codec can be supported;

NOTE: A pre-Rel-7 VGCS capable mobile station will not be able to
participate in a group call using the EFR codec, AMR half rate codec or
AMR full rate codec, if the mobile station is part of that group

\- a list of identities of dispatchers to which a dedicated link is to
be established, see subclause 8.1.2.2;

\- a list of identities of dispatchers which are allowed to initiate the
voice group call, see subclause 8.1.2.2;

\- a list of identities of dispatchers which are allowed to terminate
the voice group call, see subclause 8.1.2.2;

\- the length of time over which no activity is detected before the
voice group call is automatically terminated, see subclause 8.1.2.3;

\- the default priority level related to the voice group call if eMLPP
applies, see subclause 8.1.2.4;

\- a talker channel parameter indicating if the network shall always
establish and maintain a dedicated channel for the talking service
subscriber;

\- an indication whether the uplink reply procedure is applicable for
this voice group call.

\- in a RANflex configuration with group call redundancy: A list of GCR
addresses identifying GCRs associated to MSCs within the redundancy
pool.

The contents of each list related to requests of a group call relay MSC
is as follows:

\- a list of cells inside the MSC area of the group call relay MSC (in a
RANflex configuration with or without group call redundancy, cells
belonging to a location area for which the requesting MSC is the group
call serving MSC) into which the call is to be sent (part of the group
call area), see subclause 8.1.2.1;

\- identity of the group call anchor MSC (or group call anchor MSC
redundancy pool);

\- in a RANflex configuration with group call redundancy: A list of GCR
addresses identifying GCRs associated to MSCs within the redundancy
pool.

#### 8.1.2.1 Group call area

The group call area is defined as a list of cells. The cells shall be
defined by their cell identification consisting of the Location Area
Code and the Cell Identity as defined in 3GPP TS 24.008 and are
therefore uniquely identified in the network.

In the case the group call area extends over several MSCs, only the
cells belonging to the requesting MSC (in a RANflex configuration and in
a RANflex configuration with group call redundancy, cells belonging to
location areas for which the requesting MSC is the group call serving
MSC) are included in the group call attributes.

#### 8.1.2.2 Dispatcher identities

Dispatcher identities shall be ISDN numbers or MSISDN numbers with the
structure according to ITU‑T Recommendation E.164. They shall correspond
both to the number to be used to establish a call toward the dispatcher
and the number provided as calling line identification when the call is
originated by a dispatcher.

The list of dispatcher identities is used by the anchor MSC to establish
dedicated communication paths to each dispatcher and connect them to the
conference bridge of the call.

The list of dispatcher identities which are allowed to initiate voice
group calls is used by the anchor MSC for verification for a voice group
call establishment by a dispatcher.

The list of dispatcher identities which are allowed to terminate voice
group calls is used by the anchor MSC for verification for a voice group
call release by a dispatcher.

#### 8.1.2.3 No activity time

A timer in the anchor MSC used to release the voice group call because
of \"no activity\" can be set to a fixed value or can be set to a value
defined for each voice group call.

A group call is defined to be in the state of \"no activity\" in the
anchor MSC, if the following conditions are all fullfilled:

\- the uplink is free;

\- no dispatcher is connected;

\- no short message is waiting in the anchor MSC to be sent to the voice
group call; and

\- no application-specific data are waiting in the anchor MSC to be
relayed.

The anchor MSC shall check for the state of \"no activity\" if any of
the following events occur:

\- an uplink release is indicated to the anchor MSC;

\- a dispatcher leaves the ongoing group call;

\- the anchor MSC has completed the distribution of a short message to
the voice group call; or

\- the anchor MSC has completed the relay of application-specific data.

The anchor MSC has to start the \"no activity\" timer, when the
conditions for \"no activity\" are all fulfilled.

The timer shall be stopped and reset each time any of the following
events occurs:

\- an uplink request is indicated to the anchor MSC;

\- a dispatcher joins the ongoing group call;

\- a short message to the voice group call is received by the anchor
MSC; or

\- application-specific data are received by the anchor MSC.

When a variable timer is provided, there shall be sufficient timers such
that one can be associated with each on-going group call. The
corresponding time shall be stored in the GCR.

The length of the timer is not specified in the GSM technical
specifications.

#### 8.1.2.4 Priorities

If the eMLPP supplementary service is applied to a voice group call, the
priority level shall be stored in the GCR. For further details see 3GPP
TS 23.067.

### 8.1.3 Transient Group Call Attributes

#### 8.1.3.0 General

The GCR stores transient data for a given group call reference. These
data are maintained by the GCR to reflect the current status of the
corresponding group call.

In a RANflex configuration with group call redundancy Transient GCR Data
needs to be synchronized between all GCRs associated to MSCs belonging
to the same redundancy pool.

#### 8.1.3.1 Group Call Status Information

\- a status flag indicating if a voice group call with the related group
call reference is on-going, see subclause 11.3.1.1.1;

\- in a RANflex configuration with group call redundancy: Address of the
MSC within the redundancy pool, where the group call is ongoing (if so).

#### 8.1.3.2 Initial Talker Information

The relay MSC, and in a RANflex configuration (with or without group
call redundancy) the group call serving MSC of the initiating service
subscriber\'s current LAC, if this MSC is different from the VMSC,
interrogate the GCR twice when setting up the voice group call: The
first GCR interrogation is triggered in the relay MSC by the service
subscriber or in a RANflex configuration (with or without group call
redundancy) in the group call serving MSC by the MAP service
SEND\_GROUP\_CALL\_INFO received from the VMSC. The second GCR
interrogation is triggered in the relay MSC by the MAP service Prepare
Group Call or in a RANflex configuration (with or without group call
redundancy), if the anchor MSC is the group call serving MSC, by
receiving the IAM from the VMSC.

At the first GCR interrogation the GCR shall store transient data in the
GCR which are retrieved with the second GCR interrogation. These data
are:

\- the initiating service subscriber\'s IMSI;

\- the initiating service subscriber\'s talker priority;

\- the initiating service subscriber\'s additional information; and

\- the originating cell id.

8.2 Information managed per subscriber
--------------------------------------

### 8.2.1 Stored in the HLR

The following additional information shall be stored in the HLR:

\- the subscription option for voice group calls which can be made in
the HPLMN only or also in case of roaming;

\- a list of all the group IDs a service subscriber is entitled to use.

\- optionally, for each group ID a list of the talker priorities the
service subscriber is allowed to use. The permission to use talker
priority \"normal subscriber\" is implied by the subscription for the
group ID and does not need to be stored explicitly;

Editor\'s note : Whether the HLR additionally stores for each group ID
if the subscriber is allowed to transmit application-specific data is
ffs.

\- optionally, an information element containing operator specific
additional information about the subscriber.

The group IDs are defined in subclause 9.1.

A service subscriber shall not be provided with more than 50 group IDs.

### 8.2.2 Stored in the VLR

The list of all the group IDs and related subscription data a service
subscriber is entitled to use shall be brought forward to a VLR at the
same time as other subscriber information is copied, and VLR entries
shall be modified when corresponding HLR records are changed.

### 8.2.3 Stored in the SIM

The information detailed in subclause 8.2.1, except for the operator
specific additional information about the subscriber, also needs to be
stored on the SIM. The service subscriber shall be able to deactivate or
reactivate a group ID by MMI interaction so that the mobile station
ignores notification messages to this group ID, when the group ID is
deactivated.

If prefixes are used together with group IDs, these prefixes are not
stored on the SIM. Moreover the group IDs on the SIM are stored without
any prefix.

### 8.2.3a Stored in the USIM

The information detailed in subclause 8.2.1, except for the operator
specific additional information about the subscriber, also needs to be
stored on the USIM. The service subscriber shall be able to deactivate
or reactivate a group ID by MMI interaction so that the mobile station
ignores notification messages to this group ID, when the group ID is
deactivated.

For each group ID where data confidentiality may be applied, the USIM
needs to store the cipher algorithm to be used and the possible group
keys.

For each group ID the USIM needs to store indications whether the
service subscriber is allowed to transmit application-specific data.

If prefixes are used together with group IDs, these prefixes are not
stored on the USIM. Moreover the group IDs on the USIM are stored
without any prefix.

8.3 Information used for routing of dispatcher originated voice group calls
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Routing of dispatcher originated calls shall be performed on the MSISDN
number received at a GMSC in the Initial\_Address\_Message.

\- Because the group call reference is included in the called MSISDN
number as defined in subclause 9.2d the routing information can be
derived by the routing function of the GMSC. The GMSC afterwards
directly routes the call request to the group call anchor MSC without
requesting an HLR.

9 Identities
============

9.1 Elementary identities for group calls
-----------------------------------------

**a) Group ID**

The group ID is a sequence of decimal digits with a maximum length
depending on the composition of the group call reference defined under
c). The length of Group ID shall be in a range of 1 to 8 digits.

The mobile station derives the group ID from the group call reference by
identifying the longest group ID amongst those stored in the SIM/USIM
and matching the least significant digits of the group call reference.
If no group ID is stored in the SIM that matches the least significant
digits of the group call reference, the mobile station is not able to
derive the group ID from the group call reference.

NOTE 1: The network should use Group IDs matching an initial part of
other group IDs with greatest care, if at all.

EXAMPLE: A mobile station storing the group IDs 678, 2 678 and 42 678
(and only those) in the SIM will derive group ID 2 678 from group call
reference 13 452 678.

For definition of Group ID on the radio interface, A interface and Abis
interface, see 3GPP TS 44.068 \[11\].

For definition of Group ID coding on MAP protocol interfaces, see 3GPP
TS 29.002 \[13\].

**b) Group call area ID**

The group call area ID is a sequence of decimal digits uniquely assigned
to a group call area in one network and with a maximum length depending
on the composition of the group call reference defined under c).

**c) Group call reference**

Each voice group call in one network is uniquely identified by its Group
call reference. The group call reference is a concatenated sequence of
the group ID (as the least significant part) and the group call area ID
(as the most significant part). The group call reference shall have a
maximum length of 8 decimal digits. The composition of the group call
area ID and the group ID can be specific for each network operator.

  -------------------- ----------
  Group call area ID   Group ID
  -------------------- ----------

The group call reference is equal to the group ID when the group ID has
a length of 8 decimal digits.

For definition of Group Call Reference (with leading zeros inserted as
necessary) on the radio interface, A interface and Abis interface, see
3GPP TS 24.008 \[7\], 3GPP TS 44.018\[5\] and 3GPP TS 44.068 \[11\].

For definition of Group Call Reference coding (also known as ASCI Call
Reference, Voice Group Call Reference or Voice Broadcast Call Reference)
on MAP protocol interfaces, see 3GPP TS 29.002 \[13\].

NOTE 2: If prefixes are used together with group IDs, the least
significant digit of the group call area ID contains the prefix.

9.2 Use of identities in the network
------------------------------------

For each voice group call the identifications as defined in the
following shall be used within the network for the related purpose
mentioned.

For voice group call services which are to operate in more than one
PLMN, group identities have to be co-ordinated between the network
operators involved.

**a) Identities used for GCR requests for service subscriber originated
voice group calls**

For a service subscriber originated call, the identity of the call used
by the MSC in which the call is originated to interrogate the GCR shall
consist of the originating serving cell identity as defined in 3GPP
TS 48.008 and the group ID as defined in subclause 9.1. In a RANflex
configuration (with or without group call redundancy) the same identity
is used by the group call serving MSC to interrogate the GCR when it
receives the MAP Send Group Call Info service.

  --------------------- --------------
  Originating cell ID   **Group ID**
  --------------------- --------------

A service subscriber initiating a voice group call has to call the
wanted group ID. The MSC in which the call is originated shall
accumulate from the BSS the called group ID and the originating cell ID.

If the group call area exceeds one MSC area, the identity used to
interrogate the GCR by an MSC in which the call was not originated shall
consist of the group call reference as defined in subclause 9.1, except
for the case in a RANflex configuration (with or without group call
redundancy) where the GCR interrogation in the group call serving MSC is
triggered by receipt of the MAP Send Group Call Info service.

Without a RANflex configuration: If the group call area exceeds one MSC
area and the call was originated

\- in a relay MSC,

this relay MSC will perform a second GCR interrogation when the anchor
MSC sets up the link to the relay MSC (see subclause 11.5).

In a RANflex configuration: If the group call area exceeds one MSC area
and the call was originated

\- in a relay MSC; or

\- in a location area for which a relay MSC is the group call serving
MSC,

this relay MSC will perform a second GCR interrogation when the anchor
MSC sets up the link to the relay MSC (see subclause 11.5).

In a RANflex configuration with group call redundancy: If the group call
area exceeds one MSC area and the call was originated

\- in a relay MSC; or

\- in a location area for which a relay MSC (belonging to a redundancy
pool) is the group call serving MSC,

this relay MSC or another relay MSC belonging to the same redundancy
pool will perform a second GCR interrogation when the anchor MSC sets up
the link to the relay MSC (see subclause 11.5).

Independent of the configuration for the second GCR interrogation the
relay MSC shall use the group call reference as defined in subclause 9.1
as the identity.

**b) Identities used for GCR requests for dispatcher originated voice
group calls**

In case of dispatcher originated call the identity used by the MSC to
interrogate the GCR shall consist of the group call reference as defined
in subclause 9.1.

**c) Identities used for notifications to service subscribers**

Identities used for notification messages shall consist of the group
call reference as defined in subclause 9.1.

**d) Identities used by dispatchers for voice group call establishment**

For dispatcher originated calls an MSISDN is dialled. The Country Code
(CC) and National Destination Code (NDC) are used as normal for routing
purposes. The CC and NDC may be omitted for internal calls. The
numbering scheme is based on ITU‑T Recommendation E.164. The Subscriber
Number (SN) is used to indicate:

\- the request of a group call by use of a prefix. The length of the
prefix shall be 1 to 2 digits;

\- the wanted group call reference as defined in subclause 9.1.

  ---- ----- -------- ----------------------
  CC   NDC   Prefix   Group call reference
  ---- ----- -------- ----------------------

**e) Identities used for VLR requests for service subscriber originated
group calls**

The group ID shall be used on the B-Interface for VLR requests.

**f) Anchor MSC address for routing of service subscriber originated
calls from originating MSC to anchor MSC**

For service subscriber originated calls an anchor MSC address is used as
called party address to route the call from the originating MSC to the
anchor MSC. The anchor MSC address structure is the same as for
dispatcher originated calls (see subclause d)) The Country Code (CC) and
National Destination Code (NDC) are used as normal for routing purposes.
The numbering scheme is based on ITU‑T Recommendation E.164. The
Subscriber Number (SN) is used to indicate:

\- the request of a group call by use of a prefix. The length of the
prefix shall be 1 to 2 digits; the actual value of the prefix may be
different than the one dialled by dispatchers.

\- the wanted group call reference as defined in subclause 9.1.

  ---- ----- -------- ----------------------
  CC   NDC   Prefix   Group call reference
  ---- ----- -------- ----------------------

**g) Identities used for notifications to dispatchers**

Identities used for notification messages to dispatchers shall be
identical to those used by dispatchers to initiate calls as described in
subclause d).

A notification identity is presented to a dispatcher terminal by making
use of CLIP. Between the anchor MSC and MSC to which the dispatcher is
attached, the information may be carried using the Calling Party Number
parameter or Generic Number Parameter as agreed between the network
operators. The Country Code (CC) and National Destination Code (NDC) are
used as normal for routing purposes. The numbering scheme is based on
ITU‑T Recommendation E.164. The Subscriber Number (SN) is used to
indicate:

\- the indication of a group call by use of a prefix. The length of the
prefix shall be 1 to 2 digits; the actual value of the prefix shall be
the same as the one dialled by dispatchers

\- the group call reference as defined in subclause 9.1.

  ---- ----- -------- ----------------------
  CC   NDC   Prefix   Group call reference
  ---- ----- -------- ----------------------

The Screening Indicator shall be set to "Network Provided"

The Type of Number shall be set to "International"

10 Operation and maintenance aspects
====================================

NOTE: A list and short description of the operation and maintenance
aspects will be given. This includes the options and parameters which
can be set by the operator:

\- handling of timers;

\- registration aspects; etc.

11 Function and information flows
=================================

11.1 Group management
---------------------

The group call attributes, as given in subclause 8.1 shall be entered
and modified by the service provider. A list providing information on
necessary Operation and Maintenance actions is given in clause 10.

11.2 Group membership management
--------------------------------

Once the membership is established, the individual membership of the
group can be placed in an active or deactive state on the SIM/USIM by
the user. If a subscriber has a group ID in an active state, the
subscriber is able to establish voice group calls corresponding to that
group ID.

In a deactive state the mobile station prevents the service subscriber
from establishing calls using the group ID and the corresponding
notifications need to be \"ignored\" by the mobile station.

The active state and deactive state entries may be password protected as
an implementation option.

Group IDs are listed in the subscription data within the network and on
the SIM/USIM. The SIM/USIM must be returned to the network operator or
service provider for updating if the subscription is to be changed.

NOTE 1: Updating of subscription data over the radio interface is not
considered. However, this shall not preclude future applications if
corresponding mechanisms may be implemented.

Users can interrogate their mobile stations to determine to which groups
they are members and which subscriptions are currently in an active
state.

NOTE 2: Distribution and management of group ID prefixes is outside the
scope of this specification.

11.3 Call management
--------------------

### 11.3.1 Call establishment

A voice group call can be established by either a service subscriber or
by a dispatcher.

#### 11.3.1.1 Service subscriber call establishment

##### 11.3.1.1.1 Initial stage

The initial signalling from the calling service subscriber informs the
network that a voice group call is required and details the group ID; it
may specify originator-to-dispatcher information. No information
relative to the group call area is given by the calling service
subscriber. As an option the calling service subscriber may add a prefix
to the group ID, which is taken into acount by the network when
selecting the area.

The network shall perform a number of checks in order to determine how
to handle the call:

\- check of the ability of the subscriber to establish the call;

\- check whether the call can be initiated from the cell;

\- check of the existence of an on-going call of the same group call
reference.

The originating MSC shall check the VLR records for the ability of the
subscriber to start the call. If the service subscriber has no
subscription for the voice group call service with the indicated group
ID, the call shall be released. In addition, the VLR shall return
barring and identity presentation restriction checks to the MSC.

In a RANflex configuration the originating MSC shall then derive the
group call serving MSC address from the originating location area. If
the group call serving MSC is different from the originating MSC (or in
a RANflex configuration with group call redundancy if the originating
MSC does not belong to the group call serving MSC redundancy pool) then
the group call serving MSC is interrogated by means of the MAP service
SEND\_GROUP\_CALL\_INFO. The interrogation request contains the
originating Cell Id and the Group Id. It also contains the initiating
service subscriber\'s IMSI, the actual talker priority, and subscribed
additional information.\
If the group call serving MSC is a relay MSC for the group call, then
its GCR shall derive the anchor MSC address and the group call reference
from the originating Cell Id and Group Id, and return it to the VMSC. If
the group call serving MSC is the anchor MSC for the group call, then
its GCR shall derive the group call reference from the originating Cell
Id and Group Id, and return it to the VMSC.

Without RANflex configuration or if in a RANflex configuration with or
without group call redundancy the originating MSC is the group call
serving MSC (derived from the originating location area) it shall then
request information from the GCR by giving the group ID and the
originating cell ID as defined in subclause 9.2.

If the group ID has a length of 8 decimal digits, the operator can
define for this group ID only one group call and one group call area
within his network. If the length of the group ID is less than 8 decimal
digits, the operator can define more than one group call using the same
group ID, but different group call areas. Because of the possibility of
overlapping group call areas, each call requires a unique reference,
assigned by the GCR related to the originating MSC or the group call
serving MSC (in a RANflex configuration with or without group call
redundancy). The group call reference shall be composed of the group ID
and a group call area ID (see clause 9).

If the length of the group ID is less than 8 decimal digits, the GCR
first derives the group call area ID from the group ID and the
originating cell ID. If no group call area ID is related to the group ID
and originating cell ID, the call shall be released. If a group call
area ID is related to the group ID and originating cell ID, the GCR
shall transfer the corresponding group call attributes to the MSC.

In a network supporting prefixes together with group IDs, the operator
can define more than one group call area for a specific combination of
group ID and originating cell ID. In such a network, if the calling
service subscriber has added a prefix to the group ID, the GCR shall
derive the group call area ID from the prefix. The last digit of the
group call area ID shall match the prefix. If the prefix is not provided
or does not match the last digit of the group call area IDs to be
considered, the network shall select a default value for the prefix and
derive the group call area ID from this default prefix. The default
value for the prefix is dependent on the network of the originating MSC.

NOTE 1: Typically, the group call area ID derived from the default
prefix value will select a complete group call membership, not a subset,
and the group call area will include the group call areas derived from
the other prefix values.

NOTE 2: A mobile station not supporting the use of prefixes with group
IDs can only set up voice group calls to the group defined by the
default prefix.

If the group ID has a length of 8 decimal digits, the group call
reference is equal to the group ID. The GCR shall check whether the call
was initiated within the group call area stored in the GCR. If not, the
call shall be released; otherwise, the GCR shall transfer the
corresponding group call attributes to the MSC.

When the GCR has transfered the group call attributes to the MSC, the
call shall be considered as on-going by the GCR, unless the GCR\'s
associated MSC acts as group call relay MSC in a RANflex configuration
with or without group call redundancy.

The GCR of the relay MSC and in a RANflex configuration with or without
group call redundancy, if the group call serving MSC of the initiating
service subscriber\'s current LAC is different from the VMSC, the GCR of
this group call serving MSC shall store the initiating service
subscriber\'s IMSI, talker priority, additional information and
originating cell id for later processing.

If the originating MSC is not the group call anchor MSC for the voice
group call as indicated in the GCR, then the voice group call request
shall be passed to the group call anchor MSC; in that case, if the
initiation of the voice group call had specified
originator-to-dispatcher information and processing of
originator-to-dispatcher information is supported by the MSC, the
originator-to-dispatcher information is transformed by the originating
MSC into UUS1 and sent to the anchor MSC.

When passing the call request to the anchor MSC the originating MSC
shall include the VGCS prefix plus group call reference in the calling
party number of the IAM. If in a RANflex configuration the originating
MSC is not the group call serving MSC, it shall in addition include the
address of the group call serving MSC in the generic number parameter of
the IAM, with the number qualifier indicator set to \"additional calling
party number\". Without RANflex configuration or if in a RANflex
configuration with or without group call redundancy the originating MSC
is the group call serving MSC, it shall additionally include the address
of the originating relay MSC in the generic number parameter of the IAM,
with the number qualifier indicator set to \"additional calling party
number\", when passing the call request to the anchor MSC.

If the group call reference is composed of Group ID and group call area
ID, it is possible that two service subscribers or a service subscriber
and a dispatcher or two dispatchers may attempt to establish a call
using the same group ID and corresponding to the same group call area
ID. If the two voice group calls are established with the same group ID
but for different group call areas then separate voice group calls shall
be established. If the group call areas overlap, it is up to receiving
mobile station to determine which call to participate in. If more than
one call is made to identical group ID and group call area, the network
shall reject all but one of the call attempts.

If the group ID has a length of 8 decimal digits, if more than one call
attempt is made to the same group ID, the network shall reject all but
one of the call attempts.

A service subscriber which is entitled by his subscription to establish
voice group calls while roaming shall only be able to use supra-PLMN
group IDs as defined in subclause 9.1 in case of roaming. In case of
roaming, the mobile station shall only react on notifications for
supra-PLMN group IDs.

If the GCR receives a new interrogation related to a group call
reference where the call is indicated as on-going in the GCR, the GCR
shall provide the on-going status together with the group call reference
and - in a RANflex configuration with group call redundancy - together
with the address of the MSC within the redundancy pool where the group
call is ongoing back to the MSC. The MSC shall then

a\) in a configuration without RANflex;

b\) in a RANflex configuration; and

c\) in a RANflex configuration with group call redundancy, if the group
call is ongoing at the requesting MSC:

release the call with a cause user busy in case of a service subscriber
originated call request. The mobile station of the service subscriber
shall then look for notifications of the respective group ID on the NCH
and join the voice group call.

In case of a dispatcher originated voice group call request, the MSC
shall join the dispatcher to the conference bridge of the voice group
call, or

d\) in a RANflex configuration with group call redundancy, if the group
call is ongoing at another MSCwithin the redundanc pool:

forward the original request to the MSC within the redundancy pool where
the group call is ongoing.

Authentication of the calling service subscriber can be performed by the
network as for normal calls.

##### 11.3.1.1.2 Establishment of the transmission means

A voice group call channel shall be established in all the cells
throughout the identified group call area using physical channels
selected by the BSCs as appropriate. The downlink channels shall be
established without any return signalling from mobile stations. Whilst
the downlink channel is being established, the MSC shall form a
conference bridge containing the appropriate channels to all BTSs in the
group call area or in case of A-interface link sharing to all BSCs in
the group call area. The MSC is responsible for adding dispatchers to
the conference bridge.

Alternatively, the network may establish voice group call channels in a
cell on demand, i.e. if mobile stations respond to the notifications as
defined in subclause 4.2.2.1 (see \"uplink reply procedure\"). As a
network option the applicability of the uplink reply procedure for a
voice group call can be controlled by the GCR of the anchor MSC. If the
anchor MSC supports this feature, it shall allow all affected BSCs to
establish voice group call channels on demand only if the GCR indicates
that the uplink reply procedure is applicable. If the relay MSC supports
this feature, it shall allow all affected BSCs to establish voice group
call channels on demand only if the anchor MSC indicates during the
establishment of the voice group call that the uplink reply procedure is
applicable.

In parallel, a dedicated suitable traffic channel may be allocated to
the calling service subscriber if not already the case.

If the \"talker channel parameter\" is used and indicates that the
network shall always establish and maintain a dedicated channel for the
talking service subscriber, a dedicated suitable traffic channel shall
be allocated to the calling service subscriber. If there are not
sufficient radio resources in the originating cell to allocate a
dedicated channel and a group call channel, the group call establishment
fails and the voice group shall be released.

The call will be considered established provided that at least the
downlink channel in the originating cell, in the case of a service
subscriber originated voice group call, or the downlink channel in any
one cell within the group call area, in the case of a dispatcher
originated voice group call, is established. The MSC shall signal to the
calling service subscriber that this has occurred so that he knows when
to start speaking. If a voice group call does not meet the above
conditions in a pre-set time (Txx) then the call shall be released.

The mobile station shall indicate connection to the subscriber. If
channels could not be established in particular cells because of
congestion, channels are allocated to these cells as soon as possible.

The MSC may retry the VGCS Assignment procedure to establish channels in
cells where they are missing. If supported, the procedure may be
initiated when:

i\) congestion (i.e. a lack of A-interface circuits) prevented the VGCS
ASSIGNMENT REQUEST message from being sent to the BSS;

ii\) a VGCS ASSIGNMENT FAILURE message is received and the cause value
indicates an acceptable reason for retry (e.g. no radio resource
available);

iii\) the radio and terrestrial resources for the group call channel are
cleared (group call on-going) and the cause value indicates an
acceptable reason for retry (e.g. pre-emption);

iv\) no response to the VGCS ASSIGNMENT REQUEST message is received
(this is determined by the MSC in an implementation-dependent manner
such as expiry of a timer); or

v\) no response is received following receipt of a VGCS QUEUING
INDICATION (this is determined by the MSC in an implementation-dependent
manner such as expiry of a timer).

NOTE: If A-interface link sharing or group call re-establishment by the
BSS apply, the BSC is responsible for establishing/re-establishing
channels in cells and scenario (ii) and (iii) do not apply, unless
A-interface resources also need to be re-established (e.g. when the PCM
system serving the A-interface circuit fails (equipment failure)).
Scenario (v) does not apply to A-interface link sharing and group call
re-establishment by the BSS.

The MSC may repeat the VGCS assignment procedure until a VGCS ASSIGNMENT
RESULT message is received, the call is released or an unacceptable
reason for retry (e.g. protocol error between BSS and MSC) is received
by the MSC. The time between subsequent retries is
implementation-dependent. The MSC shall send each retry of the VGCS
ASSIGNMENT REQUEST over a new resource-controlling SCCP connection.

If a message is received with an unacceptable reason for retry then
existing procedures apply. I.e. the MSC shall initiate the clearing of
the radio and terrestrial resources, if necessary, and no further
attempts to establish a group call channel in the cell are made.

While using the retry procedure the MSC shall maintain the call
controlling SCCP connection to a BSS until the call is released or until
the MSC decides to stop any further attempts to establish group call
channels for the call on a BSS where no cells are established.

##### 11.3.1.1.3 Release of the dedicated transmission means of the calling service subscriber

The calling service subscriber shall be given a dedicated connection up
to the time where the network requests him to join the voice group call
channel. If the calling service subscriber is not talking, the network
requests him to join the voice group call channel as a listener by use
of a channel release procedure. Otherwise, the network shall request him
to join the voice group call channel as a talker by either a channel
assignment procedure or a handover procedure or a channel mode modify
procedure.

If the \"talker channel parameter\" is used and indicates that the
network shall always establish and maintain a dedicated channel for the
talking service subscriber, then the network shall not request the
calling service subscriber to join the group call channel as long as he
is talking.

For the time when the voice group call is established until the calling
service subscriber becomes a listening service subscriber for the first
time, the \"uplink busy\" flag is set (see subclause 11.3.8). Mobile
stations shall be programmed such that if they originate the call, they
indicate to the user that it is required that an indication of the
desire to speak should be made if he wants to speak. If this is not done
within a certain time, the mobile station sends an UPLINK\_REL message
to the network and the uplink shall become free.

##### 11.3.1.1.4 Release of the dedicated transmission means of mobile stations responding to a notification

Mobile stations which respond to a notification for which no description
of the voice group call channel was given in the notification message
may be given a dedicated connection up to the time where the network
requests the mobile station to join the voice group call channel. If the
service subscriber is not talking, the network requests him to join the
voice group call channel as a listener by use of a channel release
procedure. Otherwise, the network shall request him to join the voice
group call channel as a talker by either a channel assignment procedure
or a handover procedure or a channel mode modify procedure.

##### 11.3.1.1.5 void

##### 11.3.1.1.6 void

#### 11.3.1.2 Dispatcher call establishment

In the case of dispatchers originated calls the call request, in the
form of an MSISDN number, shall be received at a GMSC. Such a call can
be treated by the GMSC as a normal mobile terminated call. In this case,
the GMSC shall interrogate an HLR, determined on the basis of the MSISDN
number. The HLR in turn may either interrogate the appropriate MSC/VLR
to obtain an MSRN, or may supply an MSRN predefined in the HLR and
related to the respective group call reference in the MSC/VLR. If the
HLR interrogates the MSC/VLR for the MSRN, the HLR shall provide this
MSC/VLR with the related IMSI including the group call reference as
defined in clause 9.

Alternatively, the call request can be forwarded directly to the related
group call anchor MSC on basis of the GMSC\'s internal routing table. In
this case, the group call reference shall already be included in the
requested MSISDN number as defined in clause 9.

When interrogated by the group call anchor MSC, the GCR shall check if
the calling line identity is within the list of dispatcher identities
allowed to establish the voice group call. If not the case, the call
shall be rejected.

After reception of the call request, the group call anchor MSC checks
whether an on-going call of the same group call reference exists, in
which case for the following configurations

a\) for configurations with or without RANflex;

b\) for RANflex configurations; and

c\) for RANflex configurations with group call redundancy where the
group call is ongoing at the call request receiving MSC:

the group call anchor MSC shall add the dispatcher to the call, and for
the following configuration

d\) for RANflex configurations with group call redundancy where the
group call is ongoing at another MSC within the redundancy pool:

the call request receiving MSC shall forward the call request to the MSC
where the group call is ongoing.

At the point at which notification messages are sent to mobile stations,
a tone is relayed to the calling dispatcher to inform the dispatcher
that the message can commence.

#### 11.3.1.3 Notification procedures

Different notification procedures shall be applied in relation to the
mode of the mobile station as presented in Table 1 and Table 2 and
defined in the following sections.

Table 2: Overview on different information messages for incoming
point-to-point short messages

  ------------------------------- ---------------------------------------------
  MS states:                      Incoming point-to-point short messages
  Idle mode                       (standard paging)

  NOTE: see subclause 11.3.9.2.   
  ------------------------------- ---------------------------------------------

**a) Notification for mobile stations in idle mode**

Once the voice group call channel has been established in a cell or the
network is waiting to receive notification responses to establish a
voice group call channel, notifications shall be broadcast on the NCH in
that cell.

The position of the NCH is derived from the system information of the
BCCH.

The notification messages shall include the group call reference and
possibly the description of the voice group call channel, the call
priority if eMLPP is applied, the group cipher key number, and the
emergency mode indication, if applicable.

A notification message can contain no, one or more notifications.

The notification process needs to continue throughout the duration of
the group call, in order to permit the \"late entry\" of other mobile
stations. Mobile stations moving into the group call area which are in
idle mode shall be directed to the voice group call channel by the
notification messages, possibly by means of the notification response
procedure.

The scheduling of the notification messages in a cell shall be managed
by the BSS. Information can be added in the messages to limit the
required reception of NCH messages. The following constraints shall be
met:

\- the three first initial notifications (i.e. the first for a given
group call) shall have priority over subsequent notifications (i.e. the
messages for an on-going group call) and must be sent as soon as
possible;

NOTE 1: In addition initial notification messages for calls with or
above an operator defined priority level can be sent on all possible
paging or access grant channels to reduce the delay for those mobile
stations which are not using Discontinuous reception (DRX).

\- afterwards, an on-going group call in the cell shall be periodically
notified on the NCH.

Since the information for the establishment of a voice group call is
sent onto the NCH rather than on the PCH as for normal point-to-point
calls, the mobile station must listen to the PCH as well as to the NCH.
A \"reduced NCH monitoring\" mechanism can be used to save power in the
mobile station when listening to the NCH.

A mobile station able to receive voice group calls either, depending on
the implementation:

\- can use the \"reduced NCH monitoring\" mechanism. When entering a
cell, the mobile station shall listen to the NCH to get the
notifications of the voice group calls on-going in the cell. Afterwards,
the mobile station needs to listen to the NCH only if it is informed on
the availability of a notification for a new voice group call. This
shall be based on the NCH status information provided, as indicated in
3GPP TS 44.018;

\- do not apply the \"reduced NCH monitoring\" mechanism and read all
possible paging or access grant channels.

**b) Notifications for mobile stations in group mode dedicated channel,
group receive, group transmit or dedicated mode**

In addition to sending initial notification messages on the NCH for the
voice group call, the BSS can provide initial notification into on-going
voice broadcast, group calls and point to point calls informing mobile
stations partaking in these calls of new voice group calls that are
being set-up in the cell.

NOTE 2: The additional notification into on-going voice broadcast and
group calls and point to point calls should be provided by the BSS if
the priority level of the new call is equal or higher than the O&M
defined priority level.

In order to do this the BSS sends initial notification messages on FACCH
to all other ongoing voice broadcast, group calls, and point to point
calls in the cell. The initial notification message on FACCH shall
contain the group call reference, the priority level if eMLPP applies,
possibly the TCH description which allows the mobile station to connect
directly to the new call without reading the NCH, and the emergency mode
indication, if applicable.

An indication of change of notifications in the current cell may be
provided on SACCH by the BSS.

When the emergency mode is set or reset for a voice group call ongoing
in a cell, the BSS shall send additional notifications on FACCH to all
on-going voice broadcast, group calls, and point-to-point calls in the
respective cell.

As a mobile station option, the mobile station may read the NCH of the
current cell while in group mode dedicated channel, group receive, group
transmit or dedicated mode in order to be notified on other voice group
calls.

NOTE 3: Mobile stations may require an additional receiver to read the
NCH in order to ensure a higher probability of receiving notifications
for all present voice group calls without degradation of the received
speech quality.

Late entry of mobile stations into ongoing high priority group calls and
voice group calls in emergency mode is covered by the following
mechanisms:

\- Late entrance in dedicated mode

If a mobile station in dedicated mode is moving into an area where a
group call (VGCS or VBS) with priority level equal or higher to an
operator specific setting or a voice group call in emergency mode is
ongoing, the BSS shall resend the notification message to the mobile
station on FACCH, if the mobile station has ASCI capabilities. This
notification shall be triggered by completion of the dedicated channel
assignment.

Sending periodical notification on FACCH to the mobile station in
dedicated mode is optional, and is done as long as the group call (VGCS
or VBS) with priority level equal or higher to an operator specific
setting, is ongoing or as long as the emergency mode is set for the
voice group call, with a repetition period given by an operator specific
setting.

\- Late entrance in group receive or group transmit mode

When a group call (VGCS or VBS) with priority level equal or higher to
an operator specific setting, is established, or when the emergency mode
is set for a voice group call, the BSS shall send periodical
notification on FACCH to all ongoing voice broadcast and group calls in
the cell, except on the FACCH of the group call (VGCS or VBS) which has
initiated this periodical notification. By this method the mobile
station in group receive or group transmit mode moving into this cell is
notified. Periodical notification on FACCH is done as long as the group
call (VGCS or VBS) with priority level equal or higher to an operator
specific setting, is ongoing, or as long as the emergency mode is set
for the voice group call, with a repetition period given by an operator
specific setting.

NOTE 3a: The operator determined Periodical FACCH notification period
shall be a BSS specific operator setting and be a minimum of 1s and
maximum of 5s.

**c) Paging into on-going voice group calls**

Paging into on-going voice group calls shall be provided as an
implementation option.

In addition to establishing the links for the voice group call, the
network can provide paging information into on-going voice group calls
informing mobile stations partaking in a voice group call of new
incoming point-to-point calls. The network can also provide paging
information into ongoing voice group calls informing mobile stations in
group receive mode or group transmit mode of incoming point-to-point
short messages.

The mobile station shall be ready to receive a paging message on the
FACCH containing the mobile subscriber identity and the priority level
if eMLPP applies.

In the event of a reorganisation of the PCH the BSS shall inform the
mobile stations via the SACCH that paging reorganisation has occurred. A
mobile station receiving this indication shall decode the BCCH in order
to obtain the new paging configuration.

As a mobile station option, the mobile station may read its paging
subchannel in the current cell in group receive mode or group transmit
mode in order to receive paging messages.

NOTE 4: Mobile stations may require an additional receiver to read its
PCH subchannel in order to ensure a higher probability of receiving all
relevant paging messages without degradation of the received speech
quality. The additional receiver may be the same as used for reception
of the NCH described under b) above.

#### 11.3.1.4 Destination service subscribers

Mobile stations of destination service subscribers which are in idle
mode shall listen to notification messages on the NCH and move to the
voice group call channel or respond to the notification.

Mobile stations which are busy shall either pre-empt the current call
(if eMLPP is applied and the new call is of a sufficient priority), or
shall provide the service subscriber with an indication similar to call
waiting, when applicable.

If the mobile station supports group IDs with prefixes and has stored
prefixes for the group ID in the notification, the mobile station shall
only react as described previously in this subclause if the last digit
of the group call area ID included in the group call reference matches
the default prefix or one of the prefixes stored for the group ID. If
the last digit of the group call area ID does not match then the mobile
station shall not react as described previously in this subclause, but
may still react by making an acknowledgement as defined in
subclause 4.2.5.

NOTE: In a network supporting the use of prefixes together with the
group ID, a mobile station not supporting the use of prefixes will react
to notification messages and can participate in any voice group call for
a group ID for which it has a subscription, regardless of any prefix
used for setting up the voice group call.

#### 11.3.1.5 Destination dispatchers

Destination dispatchers are connected into the voice group call as a
standard point-to-point call. The notification of the identity of the
received group call shall be supplied in the Calling Line Identity,
formatted according to sub-clause 9.2.

### 11.3.2 Call release

The voice group call can be terminated by the calling service subscriber
or the calling dispatcher clearing it down, or by any dispatcher
nominated in the GCR allowed to terminate the call.

#### 11.3.2.1 Call termination by the calling subscriber

The calling service subscriber will need to gain the uplink before he
can issue a termination request.

If the mobile station uses the uplink with a talker priority different
from \"normal subscriber\" it shall include this talker priority in the
termination request message. If the network supports uplink access
option (i) as defined in subclause 7.2 and A-interface link sharing
applies, the MSC shall compare the talker priority included in the
termination request message with the talker priority stored for the
current talker. If they are equal, the termination request is processed
further; otherwise the MSC discards the termination request message.

The MSC has to store the identity of the calling service subscriber and
to check it against the identity of the service subscriber which sends
the voice group call termination request. If they are equal, the MSC
shall accept the termination request and release all resources. On the
radio interface a channel release message shall be sent on the FACCH of
all cells in the group call area and then all resources are freed.

#### 11.3.2.2 Call termination by dispatchers

A dispatcher entitled to terminate the call can be a mobile subscriber
or a fixed line subscriber. The dispatcher may use out-of-band DTMF
messages as a means for the control of the call termination, if it is a
mobile dispatcher. The dispatcher may use , or DTMF tones or the
signalling option specified in ETSI TS 103 389 \[19\], if it is a fixed
line dispatcher.

If the call is terminated by a mobile dispatcher using DTMF, the
out-of-band messages START\_DTMF(X) and STOP\_DTMF are sent via the
radio interface towards the network. If the out-of-band DTMF messages
are sent by a mobile dispatcher who is not controlled by the anchor MSC,
the DTMF messages will be converted by the controlling MSC (e.g. relay
MSC or visited MSC) into DTMF tones and these DTMF tones will be sent
through the network to the anchor MSC.

If a fixed dispatcher initiates DTMF tones, the DTMF tones will be sent
through the network to the anchor MSC.

Both in case of a mobile and a fixed line dispatcher the anchor MSC is
responsible for the detection and collection of the out-of-band DTMF
messages or in-band signals. After the evaluation of the received
information, the anchor MSC shall trigger the appropriate function (see
the figures 7b to 7d in 11.3.8).

In order to avoid the erroneous detection of the specific DTMF tone
sequence for call termination by the MSC, this sequence shall consist of
at least three DTMF digits.

#### 11.3.2.3 Call termination on expiry of no activity timer

A time-out mechanism is required such that, if the anchor MSC does not
detect any activity (as specified in subclause 8.1.2.3) within a pre-set
time, the call is terminated by the anchor MSC. For this a timer shall
be provided with a length as defined in the group call attributes in the
GCR.

The network may provide an in-band indication, e.g. a tone, to inform
the participants of the group call about the forthcoming expiry of the
\"no activity\" timer.

### 11.3.3 Leaving of a dispatcher

A dispatcher can disconnect from the call at any time without
terminating the call. In order to terminate the call a dispatcher who is
entitled to do this must use the explicit signalling described in
subclause 11.3.2.2.

### 11.3.4 Leaving and returning to a voice group call

A service subscriber shall automatically disconnect from the call when
leaving the group call area.

A service subscriber shall be able to disconnect from the voice group
call by a de-selection/re-selection process.

A mobile station shall leave the voice group call by no longer listening
to the voice group call downlink and returning to idle mode. A voice
group call is returned to by listening to the periodic notification
messages for that call, and reacting on them appropriately.

### 11.3.5 Cell change

#### 11.3.5.1 Listening subscriber

In all cases change of cell shall be initiated and performed by the
service subscriber\'s mobile station. In order for the service
subscribers changing from one cell to another within the group call area
a cell list for the neighbouring cells belonging to this group call area
is periodically broadcast on the downlink SACCH of the voice group call.
In this case, mobile stations entering a new cell shall perform cell
change according to the algorithm C2, see 3GPP TS 45.008 and 3GPP TS
43.022.

Mobile stations which want to enter a cell shall listen to the BCCH and
to the NCH to determine which channel they shall retune to so that they
can continue with the voice group call if available in that cell.

NOTE: Mobile stations may require an additional receiver to read the
BCCH and NCH of the neighbour cells in order to ensure a higher
probability of receiving the relevant messages without degradation of
the received speech quality. The additional receiver may be the same as
used in subclause 11.3.1.3.

Mobile stations entering a new location area shall perform location
updating as normal.

#### 11.3.5.2 Talking subscriber

Standard mobile station assisted handover shall be used for the cell
change of the talking service subscriber as defined in 3GPP TS 45.008.

If the \"talker channel parameter\" indicates that the network shall
always establish and maintain a dedicated channel for the talking
service subscriber, the channel allocated by the network in the target
cell shall always be a dedicated channel.

If the network supports uplink access option (i) as defined in subclause
7.2, collision cases between a handover of the talking service
subscriber to a voice group call channel and an uplink access message on
the same group call channel uplink shall be treated in the following
way:

\- when the BSS allocates the handover resources for the talking service
subscriber, the BSS shall send an updated UPLINK BUSY message in the
target cell and no longer accept uplink access messages on this group
call channel uplink ;

\- when the BSS already granted the uplink to another subscriber , the
BSS shall delay the resource allocation for the handover of the current
talker to the same cell. If the MSC accepts the uplink request for the
new talker , the BSS shall cancel the handover resource allocation .
Additionally, if the current talker is served by the BSS, the BSS shall
release the current talker. Otherwise, if the MSC does not accept the
uplink request for the new talker, the BSS shall release the new talker
and proceed with the handover of the current talker.

If the talking subscriber leaves the group call area or enters a BSC
area not belonging to the service area, the uplink shall not be
maintained by the network.

If the BSS does not know if one or more of the target cells are outside
the group call area, the BSS shall use the MSC controlled handover
procedure. The MSC shall reject the handover in the case that all target
cells are outside the GCA and as an option release the uplink.

In a RANflex configuration with or without group call redundancy, if the
target cell belongs to a location area for which the group call serving
MSC is not the old cell\'s serving MSC, an inter MSC handover shall be
performed.

#### 11.3.5.3 Dispatcher

Dispatchers which are mobile subscribers shall change the cell by
standard handover procedures.

### 11.3.6 New calls

Any service subscriber originated new voice group calls which have
identical group ID and group call area to on-going voice group calls
shall be rejected by the network with cause busy. The mobile station
shall then read the notifications for the corresponding group ID on the
NCH.

For any dispatcher originated new voice group calls which are identical
to on-going voice group calls as described above the network shall
include the dispatcher in the on-going call.

Otherwise, new calls are treated as detailed in subclause 11.3.8. In the
case of congestion, voice group calls are treated according to their
priority with each BSC treating each downlink depending on the situation
in each cell to which the call is sent. Therefore, it is possible that a
voice group call might be established only in a subset of the required
cells.

In the case where there are no conference bridges free, and pre-emption
is not performed, then the call request shall be rejected.

In the case of group members involved in group or point-to-point calls
who have been informed of a new voice group call, the mobile station
shall make a decision as to which to monitor as if both the on-going
call and new call were point-to-point calls, and follow the procedure
defined in 3GPP TS 23.067.

### 11.3.7 Uplink and Downlink management

#### 11.3.7.1 Uplink transmission management

The downlink FACCH channel shall be used to indicate whether the uplink
is in use.

If a request to talk is made by the user and the uplink has been free
the mobile station shall start to transmit UPLINK\_ACCESS messages as
defined in the 3GPP TS 44.018.

If the network supports the use of talker priorities, a mobile station
supporting the use of talker priorities may

\- send a request to talk even if an uplink busy indication is received,
if the talker priority of the new request is higher than the talker
priority of the current talking service subscriber; or

\- send an emergency mode reset request, if the emergency mode
indication is signalled by the network.

If a VGCS\_UPLINK\_GRANT message is received by the mobile station with
a different request reference than that of the access made by the mobile
station, the mobile station shall not signal for a further 1 s.

If in this time the uplink becomes busy, and the network does not
support the use of talker priorities, the mobile station shall indicate
to the user that the access has been denied.

If in this time the uplink becomes busy, and the network indicates in
the UPLINK\_BUSY message a talker priority equal or higher than the
talker priority used by the mobile station in the UPLINK\_ACCESS message
or PRIORITY\_UPLINK\_REQUEST message, the mobile station shall indicate
to the user that the access has been denied; otherwise, it shall resend
the UPLINK\_ACCESS message or PRIORITY\_UPLINK\_REQUEST message,
respectively.

The user shall be provided with a short indication immediately after the
reception of the VGCS\_UPLINK\_GRANT which indicates that he can speak.
Contention caused by simultaneous access messages on the uplink of the
voice group call channel shall be resolved as for standard random access
procedures. If the uplink access is rejected a further indication shall
be provided to the user to inform him that his access attempt was not
successful.

The network then shall send an UPLINK\_BUSY message on the FACCH of the
voice group call channel downlink in all cells involved in the group
call.

Signalling messages for call establishment and termination on the voice
group call channel shall then only apply for the mobile station
currently using the uplink. All other mobile stations shall not respond
to this downlink signalling. Once the request to talk is over, this
shall be indicated to the network by the mobile station, an UPLINK\_FREE
message is broadcast on all FACCHs in the group call area.

If the network supports the use of talker priorities, the BSS shall
include the priority of the current talker in the UPLINK\_BUSY message
and shall repeat the message on the FACCH every T1 seconds.

If the network supports uplink access option (i) as defined in subclause
7.2, the BSS shall indicate in the UPLINK\_BUSY message which channel
shall be used by service subscribers for an uplink request in the
current cell. The UPLINK\_BUSY message can contain two different
indications. The mobile station of the service subscriber shall act:

\- according to the \"uplink access indication for talker priority\"
when signalling an uplink request with talker priority higher than
\"normal subscriber\" or an \"emergency mode reset request; or

\- according to the \"uplink access indication for data\" when
signalling an uplink request for sending application-specific data.

If both indications are included in the UPLINK\_BUSY message, they
should be set to the same value.

If the \"talker channel parameter\" is used and indicates that the
network shall always establish and maintain a dedicated channel for the
talking service subscriber, then the BSS shall set any uplink access
indication included in the uplink busy message (i.e. \"uplink access
indication for data\", \"uplink access indication for talker priority\",
or both) to \"group call channel uplink access\".

Otherwise, the BSS shall apply the following procedures:

> If the talking service subscriber uses the group call channel uplink
> in the current cell, the BSS shall indicate in the UPLINK\_BUSY
> message that the RACH shall be used; otherwise it shall indicate that
> the group call channel uplink shall be used. The BSS shall immediately
> send an updated UPLINK\_BUSY message:

\- in the handover target cell when the BSS allocates the resources for
a handover of the talking service subscriber to the voice group call
channel in the target cell;

\- in the handover target cell when BSS releases the resources allocated
for the handover of the talking service subscriber to the voice group
call channel in the target cell, because handover failed;

\- in the handover source cell after reception of a HANDOVER SUCCEEDED
message;

\- in the current cell after the talking service subscriber has been
switched within the cell from the group call channel to a dedicated
channel or vice versa.

When the BSS receives an indication from the MSC that the emergency mode
is set in the network, the BSS shall immediately send an UPLINK\_BUSY
message on the FACCH and include also the \"emergency mode indication\".

If the BSS receives a VGCS Additional Info message from the MSC, an
ADDITIONAL\_INFO message is broadcasted on the FACCHs of the voice group
call channel downlink in all cells involved in the current group call.
If the BSS receives the additional information in the
UPLINK\_SEIZED\_CMD, UPLINK\_REQUEST\_ACKNOWLEDGE or UPLINK\_REJECT\_CMD
message then the BSS may include the information in the UPLINK BUSY
message instead of sending it in a separate ADDITIONAL\_INFO message on
the group call channel downlink. The BSS shall repeat the
ADDITIONAL\_INFO message on the SACCHs of the respective voice group
call channels every T2 seconds, until the uplink is released, or the BSS
receives an Uplink Release Command message or Uplink Seized Command
message for the respective voice group call from the MSC.

If the BSS receives a VGCS Additional Info message from the MSC and the
current talker on a dedicated channel is pre-empted by another service
subscriber with a higher talker priority, the BSS shall transmit the
additional information about the new talker also to the current talker
when releasing his dedicated channel.

#### 11.3.7.1a Transfer of a talking service subscriber to a dedicated connection

The network may decide to switch a talking service subscriber\'s mobile
station from the voice group call channel to a dedicated standard
uplink/downlink at any time. The talking subscriber\'s voice group call
channel and the dedicated channel may belong to different cells within
the group call area, i.e. the network may request the talker to perform
a handover. The dedicated connection shall then be maintained up to the
instance where the network decides that the mobile station shall join
the voice group call channel again.

If the \"talker channel parameter\" is used and indicates that the
network shall always establish and maintain a dedicated channel for the
talking service subscriber, a dedicated traffic channel shall be
allocated to the talking service subscriber. If there are not sufficient
radio resources to allocate a suitable dedicated channel in a cell
within the group call area, the MSC shall release the uplink of the
voice group call channel used by the talking service subscriber.

#### 11.3.7.1b Release of the dedicated transmission means of a talking service subscriber

For the release of the dedicated transmission means of a talking service
subscriber the procedures specified in subclause 11.3.1.1.3 apply
accordingly.

#### 11.3.7.2 Mute/Unmute downlink of the talker

This subclause applies to networks where the talking service subscriber
may use the voice group call channel. The handling of the Mute/Unmute
requests by the anchor MSC is shown in Figure 1a.

The mobile station of the talking service subscriber shall mute the
downlink to avoid non intelligible echoes when it is commanded by the
network to mute the downlink. On request of the dispatcher, the network
can command the mobile station of talking service subscriber to mute or
unmute the downlink.

If a dispatcher originates a VGCS call, he is allowed to talk
immediately when the VGCS call is established. If a dispatcher joins or
re-joins an ongoing VGCS call, he is allowed to talk to the ongoing VGCS
call at any time without need to indicate this by any kind of
signalling. If there is a talking service subscriber using the uplink of
the group call channel, he will not be able to hear the dispatcher\'s
voice.

If a dispatcher wishes to talk to the talking service subscriber and all
members of the ongoing group call, he shall indicate his wish by means
of an operator-defined operation. If the dispatcher has finished
speaking, he shall indicate this by means of another operator-defined
operation. These operations (via DTMF or the signalling option specified
in ETSI TS 103 389 \[19\]) will trigger the network to command the
talking service subscriber's MS to mute or unmute the downlink of voice
group call channel.

When the network has detected a valid unmute request from a dispatcher
it may optionally indicate the recognition of this request by playing a
"grant tone" to be received by the requesting dispatcher only. The grant
tone will be sent in-band. The attributes of the grant tone (e.g.
frequency and duration) are network operator specific.

A dispatcher can be a mobile subscriber or a fixed line subscriber. The
dispatcher uses out-of-band DTMF messages if it is a mobile dispatcher.
The dispatcher uses DTMF tones or the signalling option specified in
ETSI TS 103 389 \[19\], if it is a fixed line dispatcher. In case of a
mobile dispatcher, the out-of-band messages START\_DTMF(X) and
STOP\_DTMF are sent via the radio interface towards the network. If the
out-of-band DTMF messages are sent by a mobile dispatcher who is not
controlled by the anchor MSC, the DTMF messages will be converted by the
controlling MSC (e.g. visited MSC) into DTMF tones and these DTMF tones
will be sent through the network to the anchor MSC. If a fixed line
dispatcher initiates DTMF tones, the DTMF tones will be sent through the
network to the anchor MSC.

NOTE: The transport of DTMF tones within the network is detailed in
figures 7b, 7c and 7d.

Both for mobile and fixed line dispatchers the anchor MSC is responsible
for the detection and collection of the out-of-band or inband DTMF
signals. After the evaluation of the received information, the anchor
MSC shall trigger the appropriate action (i.e. send/not send the
SET\_PARAMETER message according to previous paragraphs, playing of the
optional grant tone).

The DTMF sequences used for signalling are implementation specific.
These two DTMF sequences shall not be the same.

### 11.3.7a Signalling procedures for the user plane

#### 11.3.7a.1 Group call re-establishment by the BSS

The MSC and BSC negotiate during the setup of a voice group call whether
\"group call re-establishment by the BSS\" is supported by both
entities.

If \"group call re-establishment by the BSS\" is supported by both
entities or the network uses a transmission architecture with
A-interface link sharing, the following procedures apply:

i\) If the BSS needs to release the group call channel in a cell due to
an equipment failure or another BSS-generated reason (e.g. preemption),
the BSS shall inform the MSC of the failure with either:

\- Uplink Release Indication and VGCS Assignment Status message if the
group call channel is serving the current talker; or

\- VGCS Assignment Status message if the group call channel is not
serving the current talker.

> The terrestrial resource for the group call channel is not released by
> the MSC.

ii\) When the condition that caused the failure is subsequently removed,
the BSS shall re-allocate a radio resource for the group call channel
and inform the MSC of the recovery with a VGCS Assignment Status
message.

iii\) If A-interface link sharing is used, each of the VGCS ASSIGNMENT
STATUS messages in item (i) and (ii) shall be sent after expiry of timer
Tast.

Otherwise, if \"group call re-establishment by the BSS\" is not
supported by both entities and the network does not use a transmission
architecture with A-interface link sharing, the following procedures
apply:

i\) If the BSS needs to release the group call channel in a cell due to
an equipment failure or another BSS-generated reason (e.g. preemption),
the BSS shall inform the MSC of the failure with either:

\- Uplink Release Indication if the group call channel is serving the
current talker; or

\- Clear Request if the group call channel is not serving the current
talker.

ii\) The MSC shall then initiate the clearing of the radio and
terrestrial resources for the group call channel. If supported, the MSC
may retry the VGCS Assignment procedure for the cell, depending on the
reason for release.

Group call re-establishment by the BSS does not apply to the dedicated
link of the talker. If the BSS needs to release the dedicated channel of
the talker due to an equipment failure or another BSS-generated reason
(e.g. preemption), the BSS shall inform the MSC of the failure with an
Uplink Release Indication. The MSC shall then initiate the clearing of
the radio and terrestrial resources for the dedicated channel.

### 11.3.8 Overview of signalling

In this overview, the messages required to implement the specified
concept are identified, and brief details are given of each message.

A diagrammatic representation of the voice group call message structure
proposed and actions required are given in figures 2 to7j.

In order to simplify the message flows for voice group call
establishment and call termination, the interaction between the MSC and
the GCR is only shown for the MSC where the originator of the group call
is located or, for the case of a group call originated by a dispatcher,
only for the anchor MSC. In all cases, a similar interaction also takes
place between the other MSC(s) and associated GCR(s) involved in the
group call.

allocated on the CCCH in the cell.

**Initial RACH CHAN\_REQ:** Standard message.

**IMM\_ASS:** Standard message sent on the AGCH.

**SERV\_REQ (voice group call):** Modified form of the current call
request message L3-MM CM SERVICE REQUEST sent on the allocated channel.
Teleservice Voice group call is indicated.

**UA (SERV\_REQ):** This message is used to acknowledge the layer 2 link
and provide contention resolution of the service request.

**COM\_L3\_INFO:** The MSC is provided with initial information about
the voice group call.

NOTE 1: Messages flows for authentication and ciphering are not
represented although performed as normal.

**PROC\_ACC\_REQ:** The MAP\_PROCESS\_ACC\_REQ message is sent to the
VLR to check the requested VGCS teleservice against the subscription
data.

**PROC\_ACC\_ACK:** The MAP\_PROCESS\_ACC\_ACK message acknowledges the
requested service.

**Authentication and Ciphering:** Authentication and Ciphering may be
performed. Acknowledgement of the service request can also be performed
by sending the CM SERVICE ACCEPT.

**SETUP:** The MSC is provided with details about the voice group call.
Optionally this message may contain a talker priority.

NOTE 2: Alternatively, an IMMEDIATE\_SETUP may have been send as the
initial message including all details of the voice group call. In this
case no SETUP message must be sent.

**SEND\_INFO\_OUT:** The requested group ID is transferred to the VLR in
the MAP\_SEND\_INFO\_FOR\_OUTGOING\_CALL message.

**COMPLETE\_CALL:** The VLR returns the MAP\_COMPLETE\_CALL message
confirming the use of the requested group ID. The VLR also returns
additional information about the calling service subscriber, if
available.

**GCR\_INT:** The group call attributes are requested from the GCR
through the GCR Interrogation message sent by the MSC.

**GCR\_INT\_ACK:** The requested information is returned from the GCR in
the GCR Interrogation Ack message.

**ASSIGNMENT\_REQUEST:** Standard message.

**CHAN\_MOD\_MODFY:** Standard message to modify the channel mode in
case of very early assignment.

**CHAN\_MOD\_MODFY\_ACK:** Standard message to acknowledge the
modification of the channel mode.

**ASSIGNMENT\_COMPLETE:** Standard message.

NOTE 3: Alternatively, early assignment or OACSU procedures might be
applied with the corresponding assignment messages not presented in
figure 2.

**VGCS\_SETUP:** This message is sent from the MSC to all affected
BSCs, \[one dedicated message for each BSC,\] including the group call
reference with the eMLPP priority, and optionally the call priority.

**VGCS\_SETUP\_ACK:** Acknowledgement message from the affected BSC in
answer to the VGCS\_SETUP message. If the setup is not successful, a
VGCS\_SETUP\_REFUSE message shall be sent instead.

**VGCS\_ASSIGNMENT\_REQ:** This message is sent from the MSC to all
affected BSCs, \[one dedicated message for every requested channel in a
cell\] including the group call reference, the channel type and possibly
the call priority and details on the ciphering.

In case of AoIP this message shall contain call identifier, codec list
and AoIP Transport layer address information.

NOTE 4: As an operator option the voice group call channels, the links
to them and optionally also the links to dispatchers can already be
established and permanently reserved in order to speed up the call
set-up for emergency voice group calls.

In case of A-interface link sharing this message shall contain a list of
all cells in the group call area served by this BSC. If the entire list
of cell identifiers does not fit into the message, one or more VGCS AREA
CELL INFO messages with additional cell identifier lists shall be sent.
If the cell of origin is served by this BSC, the cell shall be included
in the VGCS ASSIGNMENT REQUEST message.

**VGCS\_AREA\_CELL\_INFO:** This message shall contain the cell IDs that
did not fit into the VGCS ASSIGNMENT REQUEST message in case of
A-interface link sharing.

**VGCS\_ASSIGNMENT RESULT:** Acknowledgement message from the affected
BSC in answer to the assignment requests. If the assignment is not
successful, a VGCS\_ASSIGNMENT\_FAILURE message shall be sent instead.

In case of A-interface link sharing this message shall be sent as soon
as a channel could be established to the cell of origin or, if the cell
of origin is not served by this BSC, to any other cell. Then timer Tast
shall be started.

In case of AoIP this message shall contain AoIP Transport layer address,
call identifier and speech codec information.

**Tast:** In a network supporting A-interface link sharing timer Tast
shall be used to measure the duration between periodic reports from the
BSC to the MSC of Group Call Area cells for which channels have been
assigned or released since the last periodic report. When timer Tast
expires, if new cells in the Group Call Area have been established or
existing ones have been released, pre-empted or failed, the MSC shall be
informed of the changes (see subclause 7.1b). Timer Tast shall be
started again to measure the period of time until the next report. The
timer shall be stopped when the call is released.

**VGCS\_ASSIGNMENT\_STATUS:** This message shall be sent in case of
A-interface link sharing from the BSC to inform the MSC about the status
of the channel establishment to the cells of a given VGCS call. This
message shall be sent after timer Tast expires and new channels are
established or existing channels were released, pre-empted or failed.
This message shall also be immediately sent, and Tast restarted, when
all cells for a given group call area served by the BSC are established,
indicating this.

**SETUP to fixed network users:** Based on the information determined
about the users of external networks to be involved in the call, the MSC
shall initiate calls to these users in the normal manner, depending on
their mode of connection into the MSC, and shall connect them into the
conference bridge. Alternatively normal calls to GSM subscribers may be
established for dispatchers being GSM subscribers which are not
presented in the diagram.

**PREPARE\_GROUP\_CALL:** The group call attributes are sent to every
relay MSC and a Group Call number for call set-up to is requested.

**PREPARE\_GROUP\_CALL\_ACK:** The Group Call number for call set-up is
returned to the anchor MSC.

**SETUP to MSC-R:** The ISUP connection is set-up to the relay MSC.

**CONNECT from MSC-R:** Set-up of the ISUP connection to the relay MSC
is confirmed.

**SEND\_GROUP\_CALL\_END\_SIGNAL:** Indicates to the anchor MSC that at
least one voice group call channel has been established in the relay MSC
area.

**FORWARD\_GROUP\_CALL\_SIGNALLING (IMSI, additional info):** The IMSI
of the service subscriber who has established the voice group call and
who is allowed to terminate the call is sent to every relay MSC. If the
network supports the use of talker priorities, the message includes also
the talker priority. Furthermore, the message provides additional
information about the current talking service subscriber, if available.

**Txx:** Timer implemented in the MSC which is started with receipt of
the SETUP message from the calling service subscriber. If the timer
expires before the conditions for establishment have been met, as per
subclause 11.3.1.1.2, then the call shall be released.

**NOTIF\_REQ (NCH):** Messages for notification which contain the group
call reference, the priority of the call if eMLPP is applied, and
possibly the channel description of the voice group call channel to
which the mobile stations shall listen and the number of the group key
used for ciphering.

**NOTIF\_REQ (FACCH):** Message for notification sent on the FACCH to
the mobile stations currently involved in other calls. The notification
on the FACCH shall include the group call reference, and the priority
level and may also include the channel description and the group
ciphering key numbers.

**UPLINK\_SEIZED\_CMD:** If the network supports the use of talker
priorities, this message informs the BSS about the talker priority of
the current talking service subscriber and about the status of the
emergency mode. The MSC may also include additional information about
the current talking service subscriber, if the information is available
when sending this message.

**UPLINK\_BUSY:** If the network supports the use of talker priorities,
this connectionless RR message is sent on the downlink FACCH to inform
all mobile stations about the talker priority of the current talking
service subscriber and about the status of the emergency mode. The
network may also include additional information about the current
talking service subscriber, if the information is available when sending
this message and there is sufficient space available in the message. The
message is repeated on the FACCH every T1 seconds.

**VGCS\_ADD\_INFO:** The MSC sends additional information about the
current talking service subscriber to all BSCs, unless the information
was already included in the UPLINK\_SEIZED\_CMD message.

**ADD\_INFO:** The BSCs broadcast the additional information on the
FACCH to all listeners. , unless the information was already included in
the UPLINK\_BUSY message

**Periodic ADD\_ INFO (SACCH):** The message is repeated on the SACCH
every T2 seconds.

**Periodic NOTIF\_REQ (NCH):** The notifications are sent periodically
so that mobile stations moving into the area can join the voice group
call.

**Periodic SACCH Info:** Periodic messages sent on SACCH. This message
may include:

\- information of changes of notifications;

\- information used for cell re-selection.

**CONNECT:** Information to the mobile station of the calling service
subscriber that the VGCS is established with the related group call
reference as the connected number. The CONNECT message is sent as soon
as conditions for establishment are met, as per subclause 11.3.1.1.2. If
the SETUP message from the calling subscriber contained a talker
priority, the MSC returns the talker priority used by the network. This
will be lower than the requested talker priority, if the subscription
check for the requested talker priority was unsuccessful.

**UPLINK\_RELEASE:** When the calling service subscriber wants to become
a listening service subscriber for the first time, a message indicating
release of the uplink is required to be sent from the MS to the BSS in
order to set the uplink free.

NOTE 4a: For different cases of uplink release and the related message
flows refer to Figure 6.b to 6.g.

**UPLINK\_RELEASE\_INDICATION:** The BSS informs the MSC on the uplink
release.

**FORWARD\_GROUP\_CALL\_SIGNALLING (uplink release indication):** This
message is sent to every relay MSC to indicate that the uplink is free.

**CLEAR COMMAND :** The MSC requests the BSS to clear radio and
terrestrial resources associated with originator dedicated link if not
already done.

**CHAN\_RELEASE:** The BSS sends a channel release message to the
calling service subscriber\'s mobile station including the channel
description of the voice group call channel to which the mobile station
shall tune to.

NOTE 5: Alternatively, if no UPLINK\_RELEASE has been sent to the
network by the mobile station, the network may transfer the mobile
station to the voice group call channel by the channel mode modify
procedure or by an assignment procedure or by a handover procedure.

**DISC:** Two layer 2 disconnect messages shall be sent by the mobile

calls\
by a mobile dispatcher or fixed line dispatcher

**SETUP:** Mobile dispatcher or fixed line dispatcher sets up a VGCS
call. The visited MSC or the Gateway MSC receives the SETUP message with
details about the voice group call including the Group Call Reference
within the MSISDN dialled by the originating dispatcher.

**SETUP (IAM):** The visited MSC or the Gateway MSC sends an IAM message
to the anchor MSC of the group call based on the called party MSISDN
number.

**SETUP (Mobile dispatcher in anchor MSC area):** If the originating
mobile dispatcher is located in the anchor MSC area, the SETUP message
with details about the voice group call including the Group Call
Reference within the MSISDN dialled by the originating dispatcher is
received directly by the anchor MSC (further messages regarding the
standard SETUP procedure are not drawn in the Fig.)

**SEND\_INFO\_OUT:** The requested group ID is transferred to the VLR in
the internal MAP\_SEND\_INFO\_FOR\_OUTGOING\_CALL message.

**COMPLETE\_CALL:** The VLR returns the MAP\_COMPLETE\_CALL message
confirming the use of the requested group ID.

**GCR\_INT:** The group call attributes are requested from the GCR
through the GCR Interrogation message sent by the MSC.

**GCR\_INT\_ACK:** The requested information is returned from the GCR in
the GCR Interrogation Ack message.

**VGCS\_SETUP:** Anchor MSC sends to BSS's a VGCS SETUP message across
VGCS call controlling SCCP connection to initiate a VGCS call set-up
procedures.

**VGCS SETUP ACK**: After receiving the VGCS\_SETUP message, BSS will
allocate resources to the call and returns VGCS SETUP ACK message to the
MSC. This connection is established for the lifetime of the VGCS call.

**VGCS\_ASSIGNMENT\_REQ:** This message is sent from the MSC to all
affected BSCs, \[one dedicated message for every requested channel in a
cell,\] including the group call reference, the channel type and
possibly the call priority and details on the ciphering.

In case of AoIP this message shall contain call identifier, codec list
and AoIP Transport layer address information.

**PREPARE\_GROUP CALL:** The group call attributes are sent to every
relay MSC and a Group Call number for call set-up to is requested.

**PREPARE\_GROUP CALL ACK:** The Group Call number for call set-up is
returned to the anchor MSC.

**SETUP to MSC-R:** The ISUP connection is set-up to the relay MSC.

**VGCS\_SETUP:** Relay MSC sends to BSS's a VGCS SETUP message to
initiate a VGCS call set-up procedures.

**VGCS SETUP ACK**: After receiving the VGCS\_SETUP message, BSS will
allocate resources to the call and returns VGCS SETUP ACK message to the
MSC. This connection is established for the lifetime of the VGCS call.

**VGCS\_ASSIGNMENT\_REQ:** This message is sent from the relay MSC to
all affected BSCs, \[one dedicated message for every requested channel
in a cell,\] including the group call reference, the channel type and
possibly the call priority and details on the ciphering.

In case of AoIP this message shall contain call identifier, codec list
and AoIP Transport layer address information.

**CONNECT from MSC-R:** Set-up of the ISUP connection to the relay MSC
is confirmed.

**VGCS\_ASSIGNMENT RESULT:** Acknowledgement message from the affected
BSC in answer to the assignment requests. If the assignment is not
successful, a VGCS\_ASSIGNMENT\_FAILURE message shall be sent instead.

In case of AoIP this message shall contain AoIP Transport layer address,
call identifier and speech codec information.

**SEND\_GROUP CALL\_END\_SIGNAL:** Indicates to the anchor MSC that at
least one voice group call channel has been established in the relay MSC
area.

**Txx:** Timer implemented in the anchor MSC which is started with
receipt of the SETUP message from the dispatcher. If the timer expires
before the conditions for establishment have been met, as per subclause
11.3.1.1.2, then the call shall be released.

**FORWARD\_GROUP CALL\_SIGNALLING (uplink release indication):** The
anchor MSC indicates to all relay MSCs that the uplink is free. On
receipt of the uplink free indication the relay MSC shall send an UPLINK
RELEASE message to every BSS of the group call area to indicate that the
uplink free.

**UPLINK\_REL\_CMD and UPLINK\_FREE:** After having received the VGCS
SETUP ACK, the MSC sends to BSCs the UPLINK RELEASE CMD in order to
indicate that the call has been initiated by a dispatcher. As a
consequence, UPLINK FREE is sent on the common channel(s). Then a
service subscriber can request the uplink by using Uplink Request
procedure.

**NOTIF\_REQ (NCH):** Messages for notification which contain the group
call reference, the priority of the call if eMLPP is applied, and
possibly the channel description of the voice group call channel to
which the mobile stations shall listen and the number of the group key
used for ciphering.

**NOTIF\_REQ (FACCH):** Message for notification sent on the FACCH to
the mobile stations currently involved in other calls. The notification
on the FACCH shall include the group call reference; and the priority
level and may also include the channel description and the group
ciphering key numbers.

**CONNECT:** Information to the originating that the VGCS is established
with the related group call reference as the connected number.

**Periodic NOTIF\_REQ (NCH):** The notifications are sent periodically
so that mobile stations moving into the area can join the voice group
call.

**Periodic SACCH Info:** Periodic messages sent on SACCH. This message
may include:

\- information of changes of notifications;

> \- information used for cell re-selection.

calls\
by a service subscriber in a RANflex configuration with group call
redundancy

**See also figure 3a**

**1. SEND\_GROUP\_CALL\_INFO:** The V-MSC derives from the originating
cell\'s LAC the address of the group call serving MSC redundancy pool
and sends MAP\_SEND\_GROUP\_CALL\_INFO to it, to retrieve the group call
anchor MSC redundancy pool address. Network routing shall be configured
so that the message is routed to one of the available MSCs within the
redundancy pool. In this example MSC-R1 is selected. The message
includes initial talker information.

**2. GCR\_INT:** MSC-R 1 requests from its associated GCR the group call
reference and group call anchor MSC redundancy pool address. The message
may contain initial talker information.

**3a. SYNC\_GCR:** Initial Talker Information is propagated to all GCRs
associated to MSCs within the redundancy pool.

**3b. GCR\_INT\_ACK:** The requested information is returned from the
GCR in the GCR Interrogation Ack message. To avoid glare cases GCR 1 may
need to wait for message 5 before sending message 3b.

**4. SEND\_GROUP\_CALL\_INFO\_ACK:** The requested information is
returned to the visited MSC.

**5. SYNC\_GCR\_ACK:** Successfull GCR synchronization is acknowledged.

**6. SETUP to MSC-A:** Based on information received from the group call
serving MSC the VMSC shall set-up a dedicated connection for the calling
service subscriber to the group call anchor MSC redundancy pool. Network
routing shall be configured so that the message is routed to one of the
available MSCs within the redundancy pool. In this example MSC-A1 is
selected. The VGCS prefix plus group call reference shall be sent as
calling party number. The address of the calling service subscriber\'s
group call serving MSC pool shall be sent as generic number parameter,
with the number qualifier indicator set to \"additional calling party
number\"; this shall be the same address as used to route message 1.

**7. GCR\_INT:** MSC-A 1 requests from its associated GCR the group call
attributes and maks the group call \"on-going\".

**8a. SYNC\_GCR:** The \"on-going\" indication is propagated to all GCRs
associated to MSCs within the redundancy pool.

**8b. GCR\_INT\_ACK:** The requested information is returned from the
GCR in the GCR Interrogation Ack message. To avoid glare cases GCR 3 may
need to wait for message 9 before sending message 8b.

**9. SYNC\_GCR\_ACK:** Successfull GCR synchronization is acknowledged.

**10. PREPARE\_GROUP\_CALL:** MSC-A 1 sends PREPARE\_GROUP\_CALL to the
group call relay MSC redundancy pool. Network routing shall be
configured so that the message is routed to one of the available MSCs
within the redundancy pool. In this example MSC-R2 is selected.

**11. GCR\_INT:** MSC-R 2 interrogates its associated GCR to retrieve
the group call attributes and initial talker information and to mark the
group call \"on-going\" and to delete the initial talker information.

**12a. SYNC\_GCR:** The \"on-going\" indication is propagated to all
GCRs associated to MSCs within the redundancy pool.

**12b. GCR\_INT\_ACK:** The requested information is returned from the
GCR in the GCR Interrogation Ack message.

**13. SYNC\_GCR\_ACK:** Successfull GCR synchronization is acknowledged.

**ALLOCATE GROUP CALL NUMBER (not shown in figure 8a):** MSC-R2 requests
the Group Call number from its associated VLR

**ALLOCATE GROUP CALL NUMBER ACK (not shown in figure 8a):** The Group
Call number is returned from the VLR.

**14. PREPARE\_GROUP\_CALL\_ACK:** The Group Call number is sent to
MSC-A1.

**15. SETUP from MSC-A1:** The ISUP connection is set-up between MSC-A1
and MSC-R2 using the Group Call number received in step 14.

**RELEASE GROUP CALL NUMBER (not shown in figure 8a):** The VLR is
requested to release the Group Call number.

**16a. CONNECT to MSC-A:** Set-up of the ISUP connection from the anchor
MSC is confirmed.

**16b. SEND\_GROUP CALL\_END\_SIGNAL (IMSI, additional info):**
Indicates to the anchor MSC that conversation can start. In addition the
IMSI of calling service subscriber who has established the voice group
call and who is allowed to terminate the call is included. If the
network supports the use of talker priorities, the message includes also
the talker priority. Furthermore, the message provides additional
information about the current talking service subscriber, if available.
After sending message 16b MSC-R2 deletes initial talker information (if
any) as it may be invalid due to a lost race condition. Valid initial
talker information (if any) may be received with message 17b.

**17a. CONNECT (from MSC-A):** Call set-up of the dedicated connection
for the calling service subscriber is confirmed.

**17b. FORWARD\_GROUP\_CALL\_SIGNALLING:** Initial Talker Information is
propagated from MSC-A to MSC-R.

Figure 4: Signalling information required for the voice group call
uplink access\
in the anchor MSC without talker priority (normal case, without
contention resolution)

**UPLINK\_FREE:** This connectionless RR message is repeatedly sent by
the BSS on the main signalling link (FACCH) to inform all mobile
stations of the voice group call members that the uplink is free.

**UPLINK\_ACCESS:** This is sent on the uplink of the voice group call
channel using random access procedures. The UPLINK\_ACCESS message is
similar to a channel request but sent on the group call channel uplink.
The establishment cause for subsequent talker uplink request as defined
in 3GPP TS 44.018 shall be used for this purpose. The mobile station may
send repeated UPLINK\_ACCESS messages (see 3GPP TS 44.018).

**UPLINK\_REQUEST:** The request for the uplink is indicated to the MSC.
Only one request per BSC shall be forwarded.

**VGCS\_UPLINK\_GRANT:** The reply to the uplink request sent on the
voice group channel downlink containing information for synchronisation
of the mobile station to the network and uplink access contention
resolution. The VGCS\_UPLINK\_GRANT message shall therefore include a
request reference (reflecting the UPLINK\_ACCESS) and the physical
information required for transmission on the voice group call channel
uplink. On receipt of a VGCS\_UPLINK\_GRANT, the related mobile station
can start to send speech directly.

NOTE 11: UPLINK\_FREE messages are stopped immediately.

**UPLINK\_BUSY:** This connectionless RR message is sent on the downlink
FACCH to inform all mobile stations that the uplink is now busy.

NOTE 12: The order of UPLINK\_BUSY and SABM message is independent.

**SABM(L3msg):** The layer 2 link is set up and layer 3 information on
classmark and mobile station identity included.

**UA(L3msg):** The layer 2 link is acknowledged and the layer 3
information reflected for contention resolution.

**UPLINK\_REQUEST\_ACKNOWLEDGE:** The anchor MSC acknowledges the uplink
to one BSC. If uplink requests have been made by more than one BSC or
MSC-R, all remaining uplink requests shall be rejected by an
UPLINK\_REJECT\_CMD which is not presented in figure 4. On reception of
an UPLINK\_REJECT\_CMD the BSS shall send an UPLINK\_REL to the related
mobile station, followed by an UPLINK\_BUSY to indicate to the mobile
stations that the uplink is in use. The MSC shall send to other BSCs
which did not send an uplink request an UPLINK\_SEIZED\_CMD message
which is not presented in figure 4. On reception of an
UPLINK\_SEIZED\_CMD the BSS shall send an UPLINK\_BUSY to indicate to
the mobile stations that the uplink is in use.

**FORWARD\_GROUP CALL\_SIGNALLING (uplink seized command):** This
message is sent to all relay MSCs, to inform all mobile stations roaming
in parts of the group call area which are controlled by relay MSCs, that
the uplink is now busy.

**UPLINK\_REQUEST\_CONFIRM:** The BSS confirms the uplink use to the MSC
together with the mobile station identity.

> NOTE 12a**:** In a RANflex configuration (with or without group call
> redundancy) the uplink requesting subscriber\'s VMSC may be different
> from his current location area\'s group call serving MSC. In this case
> the retrieval of info from the (distant) VLR is done by means of the
> MAP service SEND\_GROUP\_CALL\_INFO.

**VGCS\_ADD\_INFO:** The MSC sends additional information about the new
talking service subscriber to all BSCs. The BSCs broadcast ADD\_INFO
messages containing the additional information to all listeners (not
shown in figure 4).

**FORWARD\_GROUP CALL\_SIGNALLING (additional info):** This message is
sent to all relay MSCs to provide information about the new talking
service subscriber.

**Conversation proceeds:** Once the mobile station has control of the
uplink, it shall be able to communicate directly. The two-way nature of
the conference bridge will ensure that they are already connected to all
appropriate downlink channels.

**UPLINK\_RELEASE:** When the service subscriber who has access to the
uplink wants to release the channel, then a message indicating release
of the uplink is required to be sent from the MS to the BSS on the
FACCH.

NOTE 12b: For different cases of uplink release and the related message
flows refer to Figure 6.b to 6.g.

**UPLINK\_RELEASE\_INDICATION:** The BSS informs the MSC on the uplink
release.

**FORWARD\_GROUP CALL\_SIGNALLING (uplink release indication):** The
anchor MSC indicates to all relay MSCs that the uplink is free. On
receipt of the uplink free indication the relay MSC shall send an UPLINK
RELEASE message to every BSS of the group call area to indicate that the
uplink free.

NOTE: The figure describes the handling, if MSC decides to have a
subsequent talker on a dedicated channel.

Figure 4a: Signalling information required for the voice group call
uplink access\
in the anchor MSC with talker priority \"privileged subscriber\" (normal
case, without contention resolution, subsequent talker on dedicated
channel)

**UPLINK\_FREE:** This connectionless RR message is repeatedly sent by
the BSS on the main signalling link (FACCH) to inform all mobile
stations of the voice group call members that the uplink is free.

**UPLINK\_ACCESS:** This is sent on the uplink of the voice group call
channel using random access procedures. The UPLINK\_ACCESS message is
similar to a channel request but sent on the group call channel uplink.
The establishment cause for a privileged subscriber request as defined
in 3GPP TS 44.018 shall be used for this purpose. The mobile station may
send repeated UPLINK\_ACCESS messages (see 3GPP TS 44.018).

**VGCS\_UPLINK\_GRANT:** The reply to the uplink request sent on the
voice group channel downlink containing information for synchronisation
of the mobile station to the network and uplink access contention
resolution. The VGCS\_UPLINK\_GRANT message shall therefore include a
request reference (reflecting the UPLINK\_ACCESS) and the physical
information required for transmission on the voice group call channel
uplink. On receipt of a VGCS\_UPLINK\_GRANT, the related mobile station
can start to send speech directly.

NOTE 13: UPLINK\_FREE messages are stopped immediately.

**UPLINK\_BUSY:** This connectionless RR message is sent on the downlink
FACCH to inform all mobile stations that the uplink is now busy. If the
network supports talker priorities, then the UPLINK\_BUSY indicates the
talker priority of the current talking service subscriber to all
listening service subscribers and additionally, if the emergency mode is
set in the network, the emergency mode indication. The message is
repeated on the FACCH every T1 seconds.

NOTE 14: The order of UPLINK\_BUSY and SABM message is independent.

**SABM(L3msg):** The layer 2 link is set up and layer 3 information on
classmark and mobile station identity included.

**UA(L3msg):** The layer 2 link is acknowledged and the layer 3
information reflected for contention resolution.

NOTE 15: Dedicated signalling connection on the main DCCH needs to be
established.

**UPLINK\_REQUEST:** The request for the uplink containing the MS
identity and the talker priority is indicated to the MSC. Only one
request per BSS shall be forwarded.

NOTE 16: As the BSS supports the use of talker priorities and receives
from the MS a talker priority different from \"normal subscriber\", the
BSS delays the sending of the UPLINK\_REQUEST message to the MSC, until
SABM(L3msg) with the MS identity is received from the MS. Then the BSS
includes the layer 3 message, the talker priority, and the cell identity
of the cell where the UPLINK\_ACCESS message was received in the
UPLINK\_REQUEST message. In this case the UPLINK\_REQUEST\_CONFIRM
message may be omitted by the BSS.

NOTE 16a: In a RANflex configuration (with or without group call
redundancy) the uplink requesting subscriber\'s VMSC may be different
from his current location area\'s group call serving MSC. In this case
the retrieval of info from the (distant) VLR is done by means of the MAP
service SEND\_GROUP\_CALL\_INFO.

**UPLINK\_REQUEST\_ACKNOWLEDGE:** The anchor MSC acknowledges the uplink
to one BSC. If uplink requests have been made by more than one BSC or
MSC-R, all remaining uplink requests shall be rejected by an
UPLINK\_REJECT\_CMD which is not presented in figure 4a. On reception of
an UPLINK\_REJECT\_CMD the BSS shall send an UPLINK\_REL to the related
mobile station, followed by an UPLINK\_BUSY to indicate to the mobile
stations that the uplink is in use. The MSC shall send to other BSCs
which did not send an uplink request an UPLINK\_SEIZED\_CMD message
which is not presented in figure 4a. On reception of an
UPLINK\_SEIZED\_CMD the BSS shall send an UPLINK\_BUSY to indicate to
the mobile stations that the uplink is in use.

The anchor MSC may also include additional information about the new
talking service subscriber in the UPLINK\_REQUEST\_ACKNOWLEDGE,
UPLINK\_REJECT\_CMD and UPLINK\_SEIZED\_CMD messages, if the information
is available when sending these messages. The BSS may include the
additional information in the UPLINK\_BUSY messages, if the information
is available when sending these messages and there is sufficient space
available in the messages.

**FORWARD\_GROUP CALL\_SIGNALLING (uplink seized command, privileged
subscriber, additional info):** This message is sent to all relay MSCs,
to inform all mobile stations roaming in parts of the group call area
which are controlled by relay MSCs that the uplink is now busy for a
talker with talker priority \"privileged subscriber\". Furthermore, the
message provides additional information about the new talking service
subscriber, if available.

**UPLINK\_REQUEST\_CONFIRM:** The BSS confirms the uplink use to the MSC
together with the mobile station identity.

**ASS\_REQ**: This message contains details of the resource(s) required
for the dedicated connection.

**ASSIGNMENT\_CMD**: This message contains details of the resource(s)
required and triggers the assignment procedure of the dedicated channel
at the MS.

**ASSIGNMENT\_COMP**: Standard message.

**ASS\_COMP**: Standard message.

**VGCS\_ADD\_INFO:** The MSC sends additional information about the new
talking service subscriber to all BSCs, unless the information was
already included in the UPLINK\_REQUEST\_ACKNOWLEDGE,
UPLINK\_REJECT\_CMD and UPLINK\_SEIZED\_CMD messages. The BSCs broadcast
ADD\_INFO messages containing the additional information to all
listeners (not shown in figure 4a) , unless the information was already
included in the UPLINK\_BUSY messages.

**Conversation proceeds:** Once the mobile station has control of the
uplink, it shall be able to communicate directly. The two-way nature of
the conference bridge will ensure that they are already connected to all
appropriate downlink channels.

**UPLINK\_RELEASE:** When the service subscriber who has access to the
uplink wants to release the channel, then a message indicating release
of the uplink is required to be sent from the MS to the BSS on the
FACCH.

NOTE 17: For different cases of uplink release and the related message
flows refer to Figure 6b to 6g.

**UPLINK\_RELEASE\_INDICATION:** The BSS informs the MSC of the uplink
release.

**FORWARD\_GROUP CALL\_SIGNALLING (uplink release indication):** The
anchor MSC indicates to all relay MSCs that the uplink is free. On
receipt of the uplink free indication the relay MSC shall send an UPLINK
RELEASE message to every BSS of the group call area to indicate that the

NOTE: The figure describes the handling, if the MSC decides to have a
subsequent talker on a dedicated channel.

Figure 4b: Signalling information required for the voice group call
uplink access in the anchor MSC with talker priority \"emergency
subscriber\" and pre-emption of the current talker (normal case,
subsequent talker on dedicated channel, without contention resolution)

**UPLINK\_ACCESS:** This is sent on the uplink of the voice group call
channel using random access procedures. The UPLINK\_ACCESS message is
similar to a channel request but sent on the group call channel uplink.
The establishment cause for an emergency subscriber request as defined
in 3GPP TS 44.018 shall be used for this purpose. The mobile station may
send repeated UPLINK\_ACCESS messages (see 3GPP TS 44.018).

**VGCS\_UPLINK\_GRANT:** The reply to the uplink request sent on the
voice group channel downlink containing information for synchronisation
of the mobile station to the network and uplink access contention
resolution. The VGCS\_UPLINK\_GRANT message shall therefore include a
request reference (reflecting the UPLINK\_ACCESS) and the physical
information required for transmission on the voice group call channel
uplink. On receipt of a VGCS\_UPLINK\_GRANT, the related mobile station
can start to send speech directly.

**UPLINK\_BUSY:** This connectionless RR message is sent on the downlink
FACCH to inform all mobile stations that the uplink is now busy.
UPLINK\_BUSY indicates the talker priority \"emergency subscriber\" of
the new talking service subscriber to all listening service subscribers.

NOTE 18: The order of UPLINK\_BUSY and SABM message is independent.

**SABM(L3msg):** The layer 2 link is set up and layer 3 information on
classmark and mobile station identity included.

**UA(L3msg):** The layer 2 link is acknowledged and the layer 3
information reflected for contention resolution.

NOTE 19: Dedicated signalling connection on the main DCCH needs to be
established.

**UPLINK\_REQUEST:** The request for the uplink containing the MS
identity and the talker priority is indicated to the MSC. Only one
request per BSS shall be forwarded.

NOTE 20: As the BSS supports the use of talker priorities and receives
from the MS a talker priority different from \"normal subscriber\", the
BSS delays the sending of the UPLINK\_REQUEST message to the MSC, until
SABM(L3msg) with the MS identity is received from the MS. Then the BSS
includes the layer 3 message, the talker priority, and the cell identity
of the cell where the UPLINK\_ACCESS message was received in the
UPLINK\_REQUEST message. In this case the UPLINK\_REQUEST\_CONFIRM
message may be omitted by the BSS.

NOTE 20a: In a RANflex configuration (with or without group call
redundancy) the uplink requesting subscriber\'s VMSC may be different
from his current location area\'s group call serving MSC. In this case
the retrieval of info from the (distant) VLR is done by means of the MAP
service SEND\_GROUP\_CALL\_INFO.

**UPLINK\_REQUEST\_ACKNOWLEDGE:** The anchor MSC acknowledges the uplink
to one BSC, including the talker priority and the emergency mode
indication. If uplink requests have been made by more than one BSC or
MSC-R, all remaining uplink requests shall be rejected by an
UPLINK\_REJECT\_CMD with an emergency mode indication (not presented in
figure 4b). On reception of an UPLINK\_REJECT\_CMD the BSS shall send an
UPLINK\_REL to the related mobile station, followed by an UPLINK\_BUSY
to indicate to the mobile stations that the uplink is in use. The MSC
shall send to other BSCs which did not send an uplink request an
UPLINK\_SEIZED\_CMD message with an emergency mode indication (not
presented in figure 4b). On reception of an UPLINK\_SEIZED\_CMD the BSS
shall send an UPLINK\_BUSY to indicate to the mobile stations that the
uplink is in use.

The anchor MSC may also include additional information about the new
talking service subscriber in the UPLINK\_REQUEST\_ACKNOWLEDGE,
UPLINK\_REJECT\_CMD and UPLINK\_SEIZED\_CMD messages, if the information
is available when sending these messages. The BSS may include the
additional information in the UPLINK\_BUSY messages, if the information
is available when sending these messages and there is sufficient space
available in the messages.

**UPLINK\_BUSY:** This connectionless RR message is sent on the downlink
FACCH to inform all mobile stations that the uplink is now busy with
talker priority \"emergency subscriber\" and that the emergency mode is
set in the network. The message is repeated on the FACCH every T1
seconds.

**FORWARD\_GROUP CALL\_SIGNALLING (uplink seized command, emergency
subscriber, add info):** This message is sent to all relay MSCs, to
inform all mobile stations roaming in parts of the group call area which
are controlled by relay MSCs, that the uplink is now busy for a talker
with talker priority \"emergency subscriber\" and that the emergency
mode indication shall be signalled. Furthermore, the message provides
additional information about the new talking service subscriber, if
available.

**ASS\_REQ**: This message contains details of the resource(s) required
for the dedicated connection.

**ASSIGNMENT\_CMD**: This message contains details of the resource(s)
required and triggers the assignment procedure of the dedicated channel
at the MS.

**ASSIGNMENT\_COMP**: Standard message.

**ASS\_COMP**: Standard message.

**VGCS\_ADD\_INFO:** The MSC sends additional information about the new
talking service subscriber to all BSCs, unless the information was
already included in the UPLINK\_REQUEST\_ACKNOWLEDGE,
UPLINK\_REJECT\_CMD and UPLINK\_SEIZED\_CMD messages. The BSCs broadcast
ADD\_INFO messages containing the additional information to all
listeners (not shown in figure 4b) , unless the information was already
included in the UPLINK\_BUSY messages.Additionally, the MSC sends the
additional information on the dedicated connection for the previous
talker, before this connection is released.

**CLEAR COMMAND:** The MSC requests the BSS to clear radio and
terrestrial resources associated with previous talker.

**CLEAR\_COMP**: Standard message.

**CHAN\_RELEASE:** The BSS sends a channel release message to the
previous talker\'s mobile station including the channel description of
the voice group call channel to which the mobile station shall tune to.
Additionally the BSS includes the talker priority of the new talker and
the additional information, if available, and the emergency mode
indication, if applicable.

**DISC:** Two layer 2 disconnect messages shall be sent by the mobile
station to the network.

**SCCP\_RLSD**: Standard message.

**SCCP\_RLC**: Standard message.

**Conversation proceeds:** Once the mobile station has control of the
uplink, it shall be able to communicate directly. The two-way nature of
the conference bridge will ensure that they are already connected to all
appropriate downlink channels.

Figure 4c: Signalling information required for the voice group call
uplink access\
in the anchor MSC with \"emergency mode reset request\"

**UPLINK\_ACCESS:** This is sent on the uplink of the voice group call
channel using random access procedures. The UPLINK\_ACCESS message is
similar to a channel request but sent on the group call channel uplink.
The establishment cause for emergency mode reset request as defined in
3GPP TS 44.018 shall be used for this purpose.

**EMERGENCY\_RESET\_IND:** The reception of an emergency mode reset
request is indicated to the MSC. Only one request per BSC shall be
forwarded.

NOTE 21: The BSS delays the sending of the EMERGENCY\_RESET\_IND message
to the MSC, until SABM(L3msg) with the MS identity is received from the
MS. Then the BSS includes the layer 3 message and the cell identity of
the cell where the UPLINK\_ACCESS message was received in the
EMERGENCY\_RESET\_IND message.

NOTE 21a: In a RANflex configuration (with or without group call
redundancy) the uplink requesting subscriber\'s VMSC may be different
from his current location area\'s group call serving MSC. In this case
the retrieval of info from the (distant) VLR is done by means of the MAP
service SEND\_GROUP\_CALL\_INFO.

**VGCS\_UPLINK\_GRANT:** The reply to the uplink request sent on the
voice group channel downlink containing information for synchronisation
of the mobile station to the network and uplink access contention
resolution. The VGCS\_UPLINK\_GRANT message shall therefore include a
request reference (reflecting the UPLINK\_ACCESS) and the physical
information required for transmission on the voice group call channel
uplink.

**SABM(L3msg):** The layer 2 link is set up and layer 3 information on
classmark and mobile station identity included.

**UA(L3msg):** The layer 2 link is acknowledged and the layer 3
information reflected for contention resolution.

**UPLINK\_RELEASE:** When the BSS has forwarded the emergency mode reset
request it releases the layer 2 link. A message indicating release of
the uplink is required to be sent from the BSS to the MS on the FACCH.

**EMERGENCY\_RESET\_COMMAND:** The anchor MSC commands all BSCs involved
in the voice group call to reset the emergency mode. If the BSC receives
an EMERGENCY\_RESET\_COMMAND message, it changes the content of the NCH
to indicate \"no emergency mode\" and the talker priority of the current
talking service subscriber to \"normal subscriber\", if the previous
uplink status was uplink busy with talker priority \"emergency
subscriber\".

**FORWARD\_GROUP CALL\_SIGNALLING (emergency mode reset command):** This
message is sent to all relay MSCs, to inform all BSCs controlled by
relay MSCs that the emergency mode indication shall not be sent any
longer and that the talker priority of the current talking service
subscriber is changed to \"normal subscriber\", if the previous uplink
status was uplink busy with talker priority \"emergency subscriber\".

**UPLINK\_BUSY:** This connectionless RR message is sent on the downlink
FACCH to inform all mobile stations that the voice group call is no
longer in emergency mode and that the talker priority was changed to
\"normal subscriber\", if the previous uplink status was uplink busy
with talker priority \"emergency subscriber\". The message is repeated
on the FACCH every T1 seconds.

**Conversation proceeds:** The conversation of the current talker is not
interrupted.

Figure 4d: Signalling information required for the voice group call
uplink request via RACH with talker priority \"privileged subscriber\"
in the anchor MSC and pre-emption of the current talker (normal case,
without contention resolution)

**RACH(CHAN\_REQ):** Standard message to request an SDCCH.

**IMM\_ASS:** Standard message sent on the AGCH.

**SABM (PRIORITY\_UPLINK\_REQ):** L3 message PRIORITY\_UPLINK\_REQ sent
on the allocated channel.

**UA (PRIORITY\_UPLINK\_REQ):** This message is used to acknowledge the
layer 2 link and provide contention resolution of the priority uplink
request.

**UPLINK\_BUSY (not presented in figure 4d):** If validation of Priority
Uplink Requests applies for the group call, the BSS, on receipt of a
valid Priority Uplink Request, shall send an UPLINK\_BUSY on the
downlink FACCH to inform all mobile stations that a priority request has
been made and to provide a new token. The message is sent on Tbb expiry.

**CHAN\_RELEASE:** The BSS sends a channel release message to the
service subscriber\'s mobile station.

**DISC:** Standard message to release the layer 2 link.

**UA:** Standard message to acknowledge release of the layer 2 link.

**UPLINK\_REQUEST:** The request for the uplink containing the MS
identity and the talker priority is indicated to the MSC. Only one
request per BSS shall be forwarded.

**UPLINK\_REQUEST\_ACKNOWLEDGE (privileged subscriber):** The anchor MSC
acknowledges the uplink to one BSC. If uplink requests have been made by
more than one BSC or MSC-R, all remaining uplink requests shall be
rejected by an UPLINK\_REJECT\_CMD which is not presented in figure 4d.
On reception of an UPLINK\_REJECT\_CMD the BSS shall send an UPLINK\_REL
to the related mobile station, followed by an UPLINK\_BUSY to indicate
to the mobile stations that the uplink is in use. The MSC shall send to
other BSCs which did not send an uplink request an UPLINK\_SEIZED\_CMD
message which is not presented in figure 4d. On reception of an
UPLINK\_SEIZED\_CMD the BSS shall send an UPLINK\_BUSY to indicate to
the mobile stations that the uplink is in use.

The anchor MSC may also include additional information about the new
talking service subscriber in the UPLINK\_REQUEST\_ACKNOWLEDGE,
UPLINK\_REJECT\_CMD and UPLINK\_SEIZED\_CMD messages, if the information
is available when sending these messages. The BSS may include the
additional information in the UPLINK\_BUSY messages, if the information
is available when sending these messages and there is sufficient space
available in the messages.

**UPLINK\_RELEASE:** Upon receipt of an UPLINK\_REQUEST\_ACKNOWLEDGE,
UPLINK\_REJ or UPLINK\_SEIZED\_CMD indicating the talker priority of the
new talker, the BSC releases the current talker from the uplink by
sending a message requesting release of the uplink to the mobile station
on the FACCH.

**DISC:** Standard message to release the layer 2 link.

**UA:** Standard message to acknowledge release of the layer 2 link.

NOTE 21b: In a RANflex configuration (with or without group call
redundancy) the uplink requesting subscriber\'s VMSC may be different
from his current location area\'s group call serving MSC. In this case
the retrieval of info from the (distant) VLR is done by means of the MAP
service SEND\_GROUP\_CALL\_INFO.

**FORWARD\_GROUP CALL\_SIGNALLING (uplink seized command, privileged
subscriber, add info):** This message is sent to all relay MSCs, to
inform all mobile stations roaming in parts of the group call area which
are controlled by relay MSCs, that the uplink is now busy for a talker
with talker priority \"privileged subscriber\". Furthermore, the message
provides additional information about the new talking service
subscriber, if available.

**VGCS\_UPLINK\_GRANT:** The reply to the priority uplink request sent
on the voice group channel downlink containing information for
synchronisation of the mobile station to the network and uplink access
contention resolution. The VGCS\_UPLINK\_GRANT message shall therefore
include a request reference (reflecting the PRIORITY\_UPLINK\_REQUEST)
and the physical information required for transmission on the voice
group call channel uplink. On receipt of a VGCS\_UPLINK\_GRANT, the
related mobile station can start to send speech directly.

**UPLINK\_BUSY:** This connectionless RR message is sent on the downlink
FACCH to inform all mobile stations that the uplink is now busy. If the
network supports talker priorities, then the UPLINK\_BUSY indicates the
talker priority of the current talking service subscriber to all
listening service subscribers and additionally, if the emergency mode is
set in the network, the emergency mode indication. The message is
repeated on the FACCH every T1 seconds. If validation of Priority Uplink
Requests applies each periodic UPLINK\_BUSY message shall include a new
token (i.e. a new token is broadcast every T1 seconds).

NOTE: The order of UPLINK\_BUSY and SABM message is independent.

**SABM(L3msg):** The layer 2 link is set up and layer 3 information on
classmark and mobile station identity included.

**UA(L3msg):** The layer 2 link is acknowledged and the layer 3
information reflected for contention resolution.

**UPLINK\_REQUEST\_CONFIRM:** The BSS confirms the uplink use to the MSC
together with the mobile station identity, classmark information and
optionally the CKSN.

**VGCS\_ ADD\_ INFO:** The MSC sends additional information about the
new talking service subscriber to all BSCs, unless the information was
already included in the UPLINK\_REQUEST\_ACKNOWLEDGE,
UPLINK\_REJECT\_CMD and UPLINK\_SEIZED\_CMD messages. The BSCs broadcast
ADD\_INFO messages containing the additional information to all
listeners (not shown in figure 4d) , unless the information was already
included in the UPLINK\_BUSY messages.

**Conversation proceeds:** Once the mobile station has control of the
uplink, it shall be able to communicate directly. The two-way nature of
the conference bridge will ensure that they are already connected to all
appropriate downlink channels.

Figure 4e: Signalling information required for the voice group call
uplink request via RACH with \"emergency mode reset request\" in the
anchor MSC (normal case, without contention resolution)

**RACH(CHAN\_REQ):** Standard message to request an SDCCH.

**IMM\_ASS:** Standard message sent on the AGCH.

**SABM (PRIORITY\_UPLINK\_REQ):** L3 message PRIORITY\_UPLINK\_REQ sent
on the allocated channel.

**UA (PRIORITY\_UPLINK\_REQ):** This message is used to acknowledge the
layer 2 link and provide contention resolution of the priority uplink
request.

**CHAN\_RELEASE:** The BSS sends a channel release message to the
service subscriber\'s mobile station.

**DISC:** Standard message to release the layer 2 link.

**UA:** Standard message to acknowledge release of the layer 2 link.

**UPLINK\_BUSY (not presented in figure 4e):** If validation of Priority
Uplink Requests applies for the group call, the BSS, on receipt of a
valid Priority Uplink Request, shall send an UPLINK\_BUSY on the
downlink FACCH to inform all mobile stations that a priority request has
been made and to provide a new token. The message is sent on Tbb expiry.

**EMERGENCY\_RESET\_IND:** The reception of an emergency mode reset
request is indicated to the MSC. Only one request per BSS shall be
forwarded.

**EMERGENCY\_RESET\_COMMAND:** The anchor MSC commands all BSCs involved
in the voice group call to reset the emergency mode. If the BSC receives
an EMERGENCY\_RESET\_COMMAND message, it changes the content of the NCH
to indicate \"no emergency mode\" and the talker priority of the current
talking service subscriber to \"normal subscriber\", if the previous
uplink status was uplink busy with talker priority \"emergency
subscriber\".

NOTE 21c: In a RANflex configuration (with or without group call
redundancy) the uplink requesting subscriber\'s VMSC may be different
from his current location area\'s group call serving MSC. In this case
the retrieval of info from the (distant) VLR is done by means of the MAP
service SEND\_GROUP\_CALL\_INFO.

**FORWARD\_GROUP CALL\_SIGNALLING (emergency mode reset command):** This
message is sent to all relay MSCs, to inform all BSCs controlled by
relay MSCs that the emergency mode indication shall not be sent any
longer and that the talker priority of the current talking service
subscriber is changed to \"normal subscriber\", if the previous uplink
status was uplink busy with talker priority \"emergency subscriber\".

**UPLINK\_BUSY:** This connectionless RR message is sent on the downlink
FACCH to inform all mobile stations that the voice group call is no
longer in emergency mode and that the talker priority was changed to
\"normal subscriber\", if the previous uplink status was uplink busy
with talker priority \"emergency subscriber\". The message is repeated
on the FACCH every T1 seconds. . If validation of Priority Uplink
Requests applies each periodic UPLINK\_BUSY message shall include a new
token (i.e. a new token is broadcast every T1 seconds).

**Conversation proceeds:** The conversation of the current talker is not
interrupted.

Figure 5: Signalling information required for the voice group call
uplink access\
in the relay MSC without talker priority (normal case, without
contention resolution)

**UPLINK\_FREE:** This connectionless RR message is repeatedly sent by
the BSS on the main signalling link (FACCH) to inform all mobile
stations of the voice group call members that the uplink is free.

**UPLINK\_ACCESS:** This is sent on the uplink of the voice group call
channel using random access procedures. The UPLINK\_ACCESS message is
similar to a channel request but sent on the group call channel uplink.
The establishment cause for subsequent talker uplink request as defined
in 3GPP TS 44.018 shall be used for this purpose. The mobile station may
send repeated UPLINK\_ACCESS messages (see 3GPP TS 44.018).

**UPLINK\_REQUEST:** The request for the uplink is indicated to the MSC.
Only one request per BSC shall be forwarded.

NOTE 22: If the BSS supports the use of talker priorities and receives
from the MS a talker priority different from \"normal subscriber\", the
BSS delays the sending of the UPLINK\_REQUEST message to the MSC, until
SABM(L3msg) is received from the MS. Then the BSS includes the layer 3
message, the talker priority, and the cell identity of the cell where
the UPLINK\_ACCESS message was received in the UPLINK\_REQUEST message.
In this case the UPLINK\_REQUEST\_CONFIRM message may be omitted by the
BSS.

**VGCS\_UPLINK\_GRANT:** The reply to the uplink request sent on the
voice group channel downlink containing information for synchronisation
of the mobile station to the network and uplink access contention
resolution. The VGCS\_UPLINK\_GRANT message shall therefore include a
request reference (reflecting the UPLINK\_ACCESS) and the physical
information required for transmission on the voice group call channel
uplink. On receipt of a VGCS\_UPLINK\_GRANT, the related mobile station
can start to send speech directly.

NOTE 23: UPLINK\_FREE messages are stopped immediately.

**UPLINK\_BUSY:** This connectionless RR message is sent on the downlink
FACCH to inform all mobile stations that the uplink is now busy.

NOTE 24: If the BSS supports the use of talker priorities, then it
indicates the talker priority of the current talking service subscriber
and the status of the emergency mode in the UPLINK\_BUSY message and
repeats the message on the FACCH every T1 seconds.

NOTE 25: The order of UPLINK\_BUSY and SABM message is independent.

**SABM (L3msg):** The layer 2 link is set up and layer 3 information on
classmark and mobile station identity included.

**UA (L3msg):** The layer 2 link is acknowledged and the layer 3
information reflected for contention resolution.

**PROCESS\_GROUP CALL\_SIGNALLING (uplink request):** This message is
sent to the anchor MSC, to indicate that the uplink is requested by a
subscriber roaming in the relay MSC area.

NOTE 26: If the UPLINK\_REQUEST message contained the layer 3 message,
the message provides additional information about the new talking
service subscriber, if available.

**FORWARD\_GROUP CALL\_SIGNALLING (uplink request ack):** This message
is sent to the relay MSC, to indicate that the uplink is granted to the
mobile station roaming in parts of the group call area which are
controlled by relay MSC.

**UPLINK\_REQUEST\_ACKNOWLEDGE:** The relay MSC acknowledges the uplink
to one BSC. If uplink requests have been made by more than one BSC, all
remaining uplink requests shall be rejected by an UPLINK\_REJECT\_CMD
which is not presented in figure 5. On reception of an
UPLINK\_REJECT\_CMD the BSS shall send an UPLINK\_REL to the related
mobile station, followed by an UPLINK\_BUSY to indicate to the mobile
stations that the uplink is in use. The MSC shall send to other BSCs
which did not send an uplink request an UPLINK\_SEIZED\_CMD message
which is not presented in figure 5. On reception of an
UPLINK\_SEIZED\_CMD the BSS shall send an UPLINK\_BUSY to indicate to
the mobile stations that the uplink is in use. If the BSS supports the
use of talker priorities, then it indicates the talker priority of the
current talking service subscriber and the status of the emergency mode
in the UPLINK\_BUSY message and repeats the message on the FACCH every
T1 seconds.

**UPLINK\_REQUEST\_CONFIRM :** The BSS confirms the uplink use to the
MSC together with the mobile station identity.

NOTE 26a: In a RANflex configuration (with or without group call
redundancy) the uplink requesting subscriber\'s VMSC may be different
from his current location area\'s group call serving MSC. In this case
the retrieval of info from the (distant) VLR is done by means of the MAP
service SEND\_GROUP\_CALL\_INFO.

**VGCS\_ADD\_INFO:** The MSC sends additional information about the new
talking service subscriber to all BSCs. The BSCs broadcast ADD\_INFO
messages containing the additional information to all listeners (not
shown in figure 5).

**PROCESS\_GROUP CALL\_SIGNALLING (additional info):** This message is
sent to the anchor MSC to provide information about the new talking
service subscriber. The anchor MSC forwards the message to all other
relay MSCs.

NOTE 27: This message is omitted, if the additional info was already
included in the PROCESS\_GROUP CALL\_SIGNALLING (uplink request)
message.

**Conversation proceeds:** Once the mobile station has control of the
uplink, it shall be able to communicate directly. The two-way nature of
the conference bridge will ensure that they are already connected to all
appropriate downlink channels.

**UPLINK\_RELEASE:** When the service subscriber who has access to the
uplink wants to release the channel, then a message indicating release
of the uplink is required to be sent from the MS to the BSS on the
FACCH.

NOTE 28: For different cases of uplink release and the related message
flows refer to Figure 6.b to 6.g.

**UPLINK\_RELEASE\_INDICATION:** The BSS informs the MSC on the uplink
release.

**PROCESS\_GROUP CALL\_SIGNALLING (uplink release indication):** The
relay MSC indicates to the anchor MSC that the uplink is free.

Figure 5a: Signalling information required for the voice group call
uplink request via RACH with talker priority \"privileged subscriber\"
in the relay MSC (normal case, without contention resolution)

**RACH(CHAN\_REQ):** Standard message to request an SDCCH.

**IMM\_ASS:** Standard message sent on the AGCH.

**SABM (PRIORITY\_UPLINK\_REQ):** L3 message PRIORITY\_UPLINK\_REQ sent
on the allocated channel.

**UA (PRIORITY\_UPLINK\_REQ):** This message is used to acknowledge the
layer 2 link and provide contention resolution of the service request.

**CHAN\_RELEASE:** The BSS sends a channel release message to the
service subscriber\'s mobile station.

**DISC:** Standard message to release the layer 2 link.

**UA:** Standard message to acknowledge release of the layer 2 link.

**UPLINK\_BUSY (not presented in figure 5a):** If validation of Priority
Uplink Requests applies for the group call, the BSS, on receipt of a
valid Priority Uplink Request, shall send an UPLINK\_BUSY on the
downlink FACCH to inform all mobile stations that a priority request has
been made and to provide a new token. The message is sent on Tbb expiry.

**UPLINK\_REQUEST:** The request for the uplink is indicated to the MSC.
Only one request per BSS shall be forwarded.

NOTE 28a: In a RANflex configuration (with or without group call
redundancy) the uplink requesting subscriber\'s VMSC may be different
from his current location area\'s group call serving MSC. In this case
the retrieval of info from the (distant) VLR is done by means of the MAP
service SEND\_GROUP\_CALL\_INFO.

**PROCESS\_GROUP\_CALL\_SIGNALLING (uplink request, privileged
subscriber, add info):** This message is sent to the anchor MSC, to
indicate that the uplink is requested by a subscriber with talker
priority \"privileged subscriber\" roaming in the relay MSC area.
Furthermore, the message provides additional information about the
service subscriber requesting the uplink, if additional information is
available.

**FORWARD\_GROUP\_CALL\_SIGNALLING (uplink request ack):** This message
is sent to the relay MSC, to indicate that the uplink is granted to the
mobile station roaming in parts of the group call area which are
controlled by the relay MSC.

**UPLINK\_REQUEST\_ACKNOWLEDGE:** The relay MSC acknowledges the uplink
to one BSC. If uplink requests have been made by more than one BSC, all
remaining uplink requests shall be rejected by an UPLINK\_REJECT\_CMD
which is not presented in figure 5a. On reception of an
UPLINK\_REJECT\_CMD the BSS shall send an UPLINK\_REL to the related
mobile station, followed by an UPLINK\_BUSY to indicate to the mobile
stations that the uplink is in use. The MSC shall send to other BSCs
which did not send an uplink request an UPLINK\_SEIZED\_CMD message
which is not presented in figure 5a. On reception of an
UPLINK\_SEIZED\_CMD the BSS shall send an UPLINK\_BUSY to indicate to
the mobile stations that the uplink is in use.

The anchor MSC may also include additional information about the new
talking service subscriber in the UPLINK\_REQUEST\_ACKNOWLEDGE,
UPLINK\_REJECT\_CMD and UPLINK\_SEIZED\_CMD messages, if the information
is available when sending these messages.

**UPLINK\_RELEASE:** Upon receipt of an UPLINK\_REQUEST\_ACKNOWLEDGE,
UPLINK\_REJECT\_CMD or UPLINK\_SEIZED\_CMD indicating the talker
priority of the new talker, the BSC releases the current talker from the
uplink by sending a message requesting release of the uplink to the
mobile station on the FACCH.

**DISC:** Standard message to release the layer 2 link.

**UA:** Standard message to acknowledge release of the layer 2 link.

**VGCS\_UPLINK\_GRANT:** The reply to the priority uplink request sent
on the voice group channel downlink containing information for
synchronisation of the mobile station to the network and uplink access
contention resolution. The VGCS\_UPLINK\_GRANT message shall therefore
include a request reference (reflecting the PRIORITY\_UPLINK\_REQUEST)
and the physical information required for transmission on the voice
group call channel uplink. On receipt of a VGCS\_UPLINK\_GRANT, the
related mobile station can start to send speech directly.

**UPLINK\_BUSY:** This connectionless RR message is sent on the downlink
FACCH to inform all mobile stations that the uplink is now busy. If the
network supports talker priorities, then the UPLINK\_BUSY indicates the
talker priority of the current talking service subscriber to all
listening service subscribers and additionally, if the emergency mode is
set in the network, the emergency mode indication. The message is
repeated on the FACCH every T1 seconds. If validation of Priority Uplink
Requests applies each periodic UPLINK\_BUSY message shall include a new
token (i.e. a new token is broadcast every T1 seconds). The BSS may
include the additional information about the new talking service
subscriber in the UPLINK\_BUSY message, if the information is available
when sending this message and there is sufficient space available in the
message.

NOTE: The order of UPLINK\_BUSY and SABM message is independent.

**SABM (L3msg):** The layer 2 link is set up and layer 3 information on
classmark and mobile station identity included.

**UA (L3msg):** The layer 2 link is acknowledged and the layer 3
information reflected for contention resolution.

**UPLINK\_REQUEST\_CONFIRM:** The BSS confirms the uplink use to the MSC
together with the mobile station identity, classmark information and
optionally the CKSN.

**VGCS\_ ADD\_ INFO:** The MSC sends additional information about the
new talking service subscriber to all BSCs, unless the information was
already included in the UPLINK\_REQUEST\_ACKNOWLEDGE,
UPLINK\_REJECT\_CMD and UPLINK\_SEIZED\_CMD messages. The BSCs broadcast
ADD\_INFO messages containing the additional information to all
listeners (not shown in figure 5a) , unless the information was already
included in the UPLINK\_BUSY messages.

**Conversation proceeds:** Once the mobile station has control of the
uplink, it shall be able to communicate directly. The two-way nature of
the conference bridge will ensure that they are already connected to all
appropriate downlink channels.

Figure 5b: Signalling information required when the talker is attached
to the Anchor MSC and a dispatcher sends DTMF signals

**Conversation proceeds:** The talker is in control of the uplink (see
figure 4) and is attached to the Anchor MSC. The mobile station's
downlink is muted to prevent any distracting echo being heard by the
mobile station user.

**DTMF Tones (start\_talking) or DTMF message (start\_talking):** This
signalling indicates the dispatcher's unmute request to the MSC. DTMF
Tones are used by a fixed line dispatcher while the DTMF message is used
by a mobile dispatcher.

**Grant Tone:** The Anchor MSC may optionally play an in-band tone to
the dispatcher to indicate that the dispatcher's request is recognized
and that the downlink of the talking service subscriber will be unmuted
The attributes of the grant tone (e.g. frequency and duration) are
network operator specific..

**Set Parameter (D-ATT = TRUE):** The Anchor MSC sends this message to
the mobile station to unmute the downlink so that the user can hear what
the dispatcher says.

NOTE 29: This message is sent only when the downlink of the talker is
muted.

**DTMF Tones (end\_talking) or DTMF message (end\_talking):** This
signalling indicates the dispatcher's mute request to the MSC. DTMF
Tones are used by a fixed line dispatcher while the DTMF message is used
by a mobile dispatcher.

**Set Parameter (D-ATT = FALSE):** Once the dispatcher indicates that he
has finished speaking, the Anchor MSC mutes the talker's downlink.

NOTE 30: This message is only sent when all dispatchers who have sent
the unmuting request have finished their talk.

Figure 5c: Signalling information required when the talker is attached
to a Relay MSC and a dispatcher sends DTMF signals

**Conversation proceeds:** The talker is in control of the uplink (see
figure 4) and is attached to a Relay MSC. The mobile station's downlink
is muted to prevent any distracting echo being heard by the mobile
station user.

**DTMF Tones (start\_talking or DTMF message (start\_talking):** This
signalling indicates the dispatcher's unmute request to the MSC. DTMF
Tones are used by a fixed line dispatcher while the DTMF message is used
by a mobile dispatcher.

**Grant Tone:** The Anchor MSC may optionally play an in-band tone to
the dispatcher to indicate that the dispatcher's request is recognized
and that the downlink of the talking service subscriber will be unmuted.
The attributes of the grant tone (e.g. frequency and duration) are
network operator specific.

**FORWARD\_GROUP\_CALL\_SIGNAL:** This message is sent to the Relay MSC
when anchor MSC wants to change the mute/unmute status of the talking
service subscriber. In this case **stateAttributes::DA = TRUE**, is set.

**Set Parameter (D-ATT = TRUE/FALSE):** The Relay MSC sends this message
to the talker when a FORWARD GROUP CALL SIGNAL containing a
STATE\_ATTRIBUTES information element is received. The D-ATT field is
set as received in STATE\_ATTRIBUTES element.

**DTMF Tones (end\_talking) or DTMF message (end\_talking):** This
signalling indicates the dispatcher's mute request to the MSC. DTMF
Tones are used by a fixed line dispatcher while the DTMF message is used
by a mobile dispatcher.

**FORWARD\_GROUP\_CALL\_SIGNAL:** This message is sent to the Relay MSC
when the anchor MSC wants to change the mute/unmute status of the
talking service subscriber. In this case **stateAttributes::DA = FALSE**
is set.

**Set Parameter (D-ATT = FALSE):** Once the dispatcher indicates that he
has finished speaking, the MSC mutes the talker's downlink again.

Figure 5d: Signalling information required when the talker is attached
to the Anchor MSC and a mobile dispatcher who is roaming in a non-Anchor
MSC area sends DTMF signals

**Conversation proceeds:** The talker is in control of the uplink (see
figure 4) and is attached to the Anchor MSC. The mobile station's
downlink is muted to prevent any distracting echo being heard by the
mobile station user.

**DTMF message (start\_talking):** This signalling indicates the mobile
dispatcher's unmute request to visited MSC. On reception of the DTMF
message, the visited MSC will convert it into DTMF tones and send these
DTMF tones through the network to the anchor MSC.

**Grant Tone:** The Anchor MSC may optionally play an in-band tone to
the dispatcher to indicate that the dispatcher's request is interpreted
as a request to talk and that the downlink of the talking service
subscriber will be unmuted. The attributes of the grant tone (e.g.
frequency and duration) are network operator specific.

**Set Parameter (D-ATT = TRUE):** The Anchor MSC sends this message to
the talker to force his mobile station to unmute its downlink so that
the user can hear what the dispatcher says.

**DTMF message (end\_talking):** This signalling indicates the mobile
dispatcher's mute request to the MSC.

**Set Parameter (D-ATT = FALSE):** Once the dispatcher indicates that he
has finished speaking, the Anchor MSC mutes the talker's downlink.

Figure 6a: Signalling information required for the voice group call
uplink release\
requested by the network; preemption of the current talker by a
privileged service subscriber

**UPLINK\_SEIZED\_CMD:** When the network wants to release the uplink
because a service subscriber with a higher priority has seized the
uplink in another BSS area, an UPLINK\_SEIZED\_CMD indicating the talker
priority of the new talking service subscriber is sent by the MSC. If
the BSS has sent an UPLINK\_REQUEST to the MSC, the MSC will either send
UPLINK\_REQUEST\_ACKNOWLEDGE or UPLINK\_REJECT instead of the
UPLINK\_SEIZED\_CMD.

The following figures 6.b to 6.g show the message flows applicable for
the uplink release in normal and error cases, dependent on whether the
talker is

\- on a dedicated link (e.g. the talker is the originator); or

\- on the group call channel (e.g. the talker is a subsequent talker).

NOTE: The messages CLEAR CMD, CLEAR COM, etc., are used to release the
dedicated connection of the talker.

Figure 6.b: Uplink release for the talker on a dedicated link: normal

NOTE: The messages CLEAR CMD, CLEAR COM, etc., are used to release the
dedicated connection of the talker. The same message flow applies for
all cause values different from \"call control\".

Figure 7: Signalling required to disconnect the group call

**TERMINATION REQUEST:** An authorized mobile station can send a
TERMINATION REQUEST message to clear down the entire voice group call.
To do this, the mobile station must have access to the uplink. The
network has to check the IMSI to verify the calling service subscriber.
If the IMSI of the mobile station which has uplink access is presently
not known to the network, the network shall send an identity request to
the mobile station

NOTE 31: Alternatively an authorized dispatcher can terminate the voice
group call in which case a release message is received from the external
network.

> NOTE 32: Alternatively an authorized mobile dispatcher can terminate
> the voice group call by using a specific DTMF message sequence. If the
> mobile dispatcher is controlled by the anchor MSC, the specific DTMF
> message sequence is received by the anchor MSC (see figure 7b).
>
> NOTE 33: If the mobile dispatcher is controlled by a relay MSC, the
> specific DTMF message sequence is received by the relay MSC. The relay
> MSC converts the DTMF messages into DTMF tones and sends them towards
> the anchor MSC (see figure 7c).
>
> NOTE 34: Alternatively an authorized fixed line dispatcher can
> terminate the voice group call by using a specific DTMF tone sequence
> or other applicable signalling. In case DTMF is used, the specific
> DTMF tone sequence is received by the anchor MSC (see figure 7d).

NOTE 35: Alternatively an authorized mobile station currently served by
a relay MSC can clear down the entire group call in which case either a
Release (normal call clearing) is received from the relay MSC (for the
case when the calling service subscriber still has the initial dedicated
connection to MSC-A) or a PROCESS\_GROUP CALL\_SIGNALLING message
indicating call release is received from the relay MSC (when the calling
service subscriber is on the group call channel or has a dedicated
connection to the relay MSC).

**CLEAR CMD:** This message is sent from the MSC to the BSS via each
Resource Controlling SCCP connection to clear radio and terrestrial
resources.

**VGCS\_TERMIN:** The MSC informs the GCR that the voice group call with
the related group call reference is terminated.

**CHANNEL RELEASE:** CHANNEL RELEASE messages are sent on all downlink
FACCH to the service subscribers. The CHANNEL RELEASE messages shall be
repeated for a predefined period in order to provide a high probability
that the listening mobile stations receive the message.

\- CHANNEL RELEASE message is sent using I frame for the talker.

\- CHANNEL RELEASE messages are sent using UI frames for listeners.

In addition, release messages are sent to all related dispatchers and
relay MSCs. If the group call termination is initiated by an entitled
dispatcher, and there is a dedicated connection for the calling service
subscriber between the anchor MSC and the relay MSC, the anchor MSC
shall release this connection with cause \'normal call clearing'.

**SEND\_GROUP CALL\_END\_SIGNAL\_ACK**: The dialogues to all relay MSCs
are closed.

**CLEAR COMPLETE:** standard message.

**SCCP\_RLSD:** standard message sent via resource controlling SCCP
connection.

**SCCP\_RLC:** standard message.

**CLEAR CMD:** This message is sent from the MSC to the BSS via the Call
Controlling SCCP connection, after all the terrestrial resources
associated with the BSS for this group call have been released.

**CLEAR COMPLETE:** standard message.

**SCCP\_RLSD:** standard message sent via call controlling SCCP
connection.

**SCCP\_RLC:** standard message.

Figure 7a: Signalling information required for establishing voice group
calls\
by a service subscriber using immediate setup

**SYS\_INFO (NCH allocated):** Message used to indicate if the NCH is
allocated on the CCCH in the cell.

**Initial RACH CHAN\_REQ:** Standard message.

**IMM\_ASSIGNMENT:** Standard message sent on the AGCH.

**IMMEDIATE\_SETUP:** This message including all details of the voice
group call is sent by the MS to the network in order to set-up a group
call immediately, i.e. without previous establishment of an MM
connection.

**UA (IMMEDIATE\_SETUP):** This message is used to acknowledge the layer
2 link and provide contention resolution of the immediate setup.

NOTE 36: Authentication and/ or activation of Ciphering may be performed
before or after sending a CONNECT message. If ciphering has not been
activated before sending a CONNECT message, a CM\_SERVICE ACCEPT may be
sent before the CONNECT message by the MSC, however sending of the
CM\_SERVICE\_ACCEPT is not mandatory.

Figure 7e: Validation of Priority Uplink Requests for ciphered group
calls

NOTE:\
MS = service subscriber requesting priority access to the uplink\
MSs = all service subscribers in the group, in this BSS area\
Token (A, B\...J) = 32bit random number, generated by the BSS. Broadcast
in UPLINK BUSY messages on the ciphered group channel downlink (FACCH)

**Figure 7e Scenarios:**

1\. For a service subscriber originated group call, if the call is
ciphered, the BSS includes a token in the first UPLINK BUSY message sent
on the group channel downlink. For a dispatcher originated group call,
if the call is ciphered, the BSS includes a token in the first UPLINK
BUSY message sent after the first successful uplink access by a service
subscriber. A new token is sent in each periodic UPLINK BUSY message,
every T1 seconds. If the old token has not been used it remains valid
for a further Ttv seconds along with the new token. Once Ttv expires
only the new token is valid. (If, within Ttv seconds, a Priority Uplink
Request is received with the old token, the request is accepted, the old
and new tokens are invalidated and an UPLINK BUSY, with another new
token and the priority of the accepted request, is sent after Tbb ms on
the group channel downlink.)

2\. Subscriber on the group call with \'Privilege' or \'Emergency'
subscription requests the uplink. Token matches in BSS. A new token, and
the priority of the accepted request, are sent after Tbb ms in an UPLINK
BUSY on the group channel downlink to ensure higher priority requests
can still be made in the cells covered by this BSS. Timer T1 is reset
and restarted.

3\. Subscriber on the group call with \'Emergency Mode Reset'
subscription requests an \'Emergency Mode Reset'. Token matches in BSS.
A new token is sent after Tbb ms in an UPLINK BUSY on the group channel
downlink. Timer T1 is reset and restarted.

4\. User not on the group call makes fraudulent uplink request. Token
does not match in BSS. BSS discards message. BSS continues to broadcast
tokens in periodic UPLINK BUSY messages.

5\. Subscriber on the group call with a \'Privilege', \'Emergency' or
\'Emergency Mode Reset' subscription requests the uplink. No token
included in the request. BSS discards message. BSS continues to
broadcast tokens in periodic UPLINK BUSY messages.

6\. Subscriber with a \'Privilege' subscription requests the uplink.
Token matches in BSS. A new token, and the priority of the accepted
request (i.e. \'Privilege'), are sent after Tbb ms in an UPLINK BUSY on
the group channel downlink, however a subscriber with an \'Emergency'
subscription requests the uplink before the new token has been received
by the MS (use of the old token, causes the message to be discarded by
BSS). On receipt of the UPLINK BUSY with new token and priority
\'Privilege', the MS resends the Priority Uplink Request (\'Emergency')
with the new token.

7\. When a subscriber releases the uplink, timer T1 is stopped and the
BSS broadcasts UPLINK FREE. A token is not broadcast while the uplink is
free.

8\. A subscriber requests the uplink by sending an UPLINK ACCESS on the
group channel uplink. The BSS grants the uplink and a UPLINK BUSY
including a new token, and the current talker priority, is sent on the
group channel downlink. A new token and the current talker priority is
also sent in UPLINK BUSY on the group channel downlink if the uplink
becomes busy because it is granted in another BSS or MSC area and an
UPLINK\_REJECT\_CMD or UPLINK\_SEIZED\_CMD is received by the BSS.

Figure 7f: A listener in the anchor MSC area sends application-specific
data to the other group call members, while the group call channel
uplink in the cell is free

**UPLINK\_ACCESS (Establishment\_cause=UL Request for sending
application-specific data):** This message is sent on the uplink of the
voice group call channel using random access procedures. The UPLINK
ACCESS message is similar to a channel request but sent on the group
call channel uplink.

**VGCS\_UPLINK\_GRANT:** The BSS grants the uplink of its group call
channel immediately. The reply to the uplink request sent on the voice
group channel downlink containing information for synchronisation of the
mobile station to the network and uplink access contention resolution.
The VGCS\_UPLINK\_GRANT message shall therefore include a request
reference (reflecting the UPLINK\_ACCESS) and the physical information
required for transmission on the voice group call channel uplink.

**SABM (DATA\_INDICATION (Application\_data)):** The MS sends a SABM
message with its mobile station identity and the Application data to the
BSS.

**UA(DATA\_INDICATION (Application\_data)):** This message is used to
acknowledge the layer 2 link and provide contention resolution of the
data indication.

**NOTIFY\_APPLICATION\_DATA (Application\_data):** If the network option
of immediate distribution of application-specific data by the BSS is
activated, on receiving the application data sent from the MS, the BSS
broadcasts the application data immediately to the cells within the BSC
area in a notification message on the FACCH. Optionally, the
NOTIFY\_APPLICATION\_DATA message for application-specific data is
repeated on the group call channel downlink. As a prerequisite for the
immediate distribution, during the establishment phase of the voice
group call the BSC stored the cell identities of the cells belonging to
the group call area and served by the BSC.

**UPLINK\_APPLICATION\_DATA (CID, IDI, DATA\_INDICATION):** The BSS adds
the sender's cell identifier (CID) and passes the L3 information
(DATA\_INDICATION) via the UPLINK\_APPLICATION\_DATA message to the MSC.
If the BSC has immediately distributed the application data to its BSC
area, the BSC shall additionally include the Immediate Distribution
Indicator (IDI).

**UPLINK\_RELEASE:** The BSS immediately releases the uplink by sending
this message to the MS on the FACCH.

**DISC:** Standard message to release the layer 2 link.

**UA:** Standard message to acknowledge release of the layer 2 link. The
mobile station returns to group receive mode.

**FORWARD\_GROUP CALL\_SIGNALLING (NOTIFICATION\_DATA):** On receipt of
the UPLINK\_APPLICATION\_DATA message, the anchor MSC shall put the
application data and optionally the mobile subscriber\'s MSISDN into the
BSSMAP message NOTIFICATION\_DATA and distribute the message towards all
relay MSCs.

Editor\'s note: The condition for including the MSISDN in the BSSMAP
message NOTIFICATION\_DATA is ffs.

**NOTIFICATION\_DATA:** The MSC sends NOTIFICATION\_DATA messages with
the application data to all BSSs in their MSC area involved in the group
call. If the originating BSC has immediately distributed the application
data to its BSC area, the **MSC shall not send the** NOTIFICATION DATA
message **to the originating BSC**.

**NOTIFY\_APPLICATION\_DATA (Application\_data):** The BSS broadcasts
the application data to all listeners and the talker, if any, in a
notification message on the FACCH. Optionally the
NOTIFY\_APPLICATION\_DATA message for application-specific data is
repeated on the group call channel downlink. (The broadcast of the
application data by the other BSSs is not shown in figure 7f.)

Figure 7g: A talker in the anchor MSC area sends application-specific
data to the other group call members.

**DATA\_INDICATION (Application\_data):** Since the talker has the
uplink and a layer 2 link is established, the MS can send the
application data to the BSS.

For the meaning of the other messages see figure 7f. The option of
immediate distribution of the application-specific data by the BSC can
be applied also in figure 7g, although it is not shown in the message
flow (for details see figure 7f).

Figure 7h: A listener in a relay MSC area sends application-specific
data to the other group call members, while the group call channel
uplink in the cell is free.

In the following only the messages different from figure 7f are
explained:

**PROCESS\_GROUP CALL\_SIGNALLING (NOTIFICATION\_DATA):** On receipt of
the UPLINK\_APPLICATION\_DATA message the relay MSC shall put the
application data and optionally the mobile subscriber\'s MSISDN into the
BSSMAP message NOTIFICATION\_DATA and send the message to the anchor
MSC.

Editor\'s note: The condition for including the MSISDN in the BSSMAP
message NOTIFICATION\_DATA is for FFS.

**FORWARD\_GROUP CALL\_SIGNALLING (NOTIFICATION\_DATA):** On receipt of
the NOTIFICATION\_DATA, the anchor MSC shall forward the message to all
relay MSCs except the relay MSC from which the NOTIFICATION\_DATA was
received. The relay MSCs shall send the NOTIFICATION\_DATA messages with
the application data to all BSSs in their MSC area involved in the group
call. The BSSs shall broadcast the data to all listeners.

For the meaning of the other messages see figure 7f. The option of
immediate distribution of the application-specific data by the BSC can
be applied also in figure 7h, although it is not shown in the message
flow (for details see figure 7f).

Figure 7i: After receiving application-specific data, a service
subscriber in the anchor MSC area sends a confirmation for the received
data to the other group call members, while the group call channel
uplink in the cell is free.

**UPLINK\_ACCESS (Establishment\_cause=UL Request for sending
application-specific data):** This message is sent on the uplink of the
voice group call channel using random access procedures. The
UPLINK\_ACCESS message is similar to a channel request but sent on the
group call channel uplink.

**VGCS\_UPLINK\_GRANT:** The BSS grants the Uplink of its group call
channel immediately. The reply to the uplink request sent on the voice
group channel downlink containing information for synchronisation of the
mobile station to the network and uplink access contention resolution.
The VGCS\_UPLINK\_GRANT message shall therefore include a request
reference (reflecting the UPLINK\_ACCESS) and the physical information
required for transmission on the voice group call channel uplink.

**SABM (DATA\_INDICATION (Application\_data)):** The MS sends a SABM
message with its mobile station identity and the Application\_data to
the BSS. For the purpose of identifying the received data, the data\_id
which was received in the message that contained the application data
that is being confirmed shall be included in the message.

For the meaning of the other messages see figure 7f. The option of
immediate distribution of the application-specific data by the BSC can
be applied also in figure 7i, although it is not shown in the message
flow (for details see figure 7f).

Figure 7j: A listener in the anchor MSC area sends application-specific
data that are not time-critical via RACH to the other group call
members, while the talker is using the group call channel uplink in the
same cell.

**RACH (CHAN\_REQ):** The network supports uplink access option (i) as
defined in subclause 7.2, and the talker is on the group call channel in
the same cell as the mobile station of the listener; therefore, the
\"uplink access indication for data\" in the uplink busy message
instructs the mobile station to use the RACH when application-specific
data is to be sent.

The mobile station leaves the group receive mode and sends the
CHANNEL\_REQUEST message with an appropriate establishment cause via the
RACH to request an SDCCH.

**IMM\_ASS:** Standard message sent on the AGCH.

**SABM (DATA\_INDICATION\_2 (Application\_data)):** The MS sends a SABM
message with its mobile station identity and the Application\_data to
the BSS on SDCCH. The network determines from the group call reference
included in the message which group call is addressed by this message.

**UA (DATA\_INDICATION\_2 (Application\_data)):** This message is used
to acknowledge the layer 2 link and provide contention resolution of the
data indication 2.

NOTE 1: Optionally, on receipt of the UA (DATA\_INDICATION\_2
(Application\_data) the mobile station performs a local release of the
layer 2 link, i.e. without exchange of DISC/UA, and returns to group
receive mode.

**NOTIFY\_APPLICATION\_DATA (Application\_data):** If the network option
of immediate distribution of application-specific data by the BSC is
activated, on receiving the application data sent from the MS, the BSS
broadcasts the application data immediately to the cells within the BSC
area in a notification message on the FACCH. Optionally, the
NOTIFY\_APPLICATION\_DATA message for application-specific data is
repeated on the group call channel downlink. As a prerequisite for the
immediate distribution, during the establishment phase of the voice
group call the BSC stored the cell identities of the cells belonging to
the group call area and served by the BSC.

**UPLINK\_APPLICATION\_DATA (CID, IDI, DATA\_INDICATION\_2):** The BSS
adds the sender's cell identifier (CID) and passes the L3 information
(DATA\_INDICATION\_2) via the UPLINK\_APPLICATION\_DATA message to the
MSC. If the BSC has immediately distributed the application data to its
BSC area, the BSC shall additionally include the Immediate Distribution
Indicator (IDI).

**CHANNEL\_RELEASE:** The BSS immediately releases the uplink by sending
this message to the MS on the SDCCH including the channel description of
the voice group call channel to which the mobile station shall tune to.
The mobile station returns to group receive mode.

NOTE 2: If the mobile station performed a local release of the layer 2
link, the following two messages will not be exchanged. Instead T3109 in
the BSS will expire and the BSS will release the channel.

**DISC:** Standard message to release the layer 2 link.

**UA:** Standard message to acknowledge release of the layer 2 link. The
mobile station returns to group receive mode.

**NOTIFICATION\_DATA:** The MSC sends NOTIFICATION\_DATA messages with
the application data to all BSSs in their MSC area involved in the group
call. If the originating BSC has immediately distributed the application
data to its BSC area, the **MSC shall not send the** NOTIFICATION DATA
message **to the originating BSC**.

**NOTIFY\_APPLICATION\_DATA (Application\_data):** The BSS broadcasts
the application data to all listeners and the talker, if any, in a
notification message on the FACCH. Optionally the
NOTIFY\_APPLICATION\_DATA message for application-specific data is
repeated on the group call channel downlink. (The broadcast of the
application data by the other BSSs is not shown in figure 7j.)

For the meaning of the other messages see figure 7f.

### 11.3.9 Short Message Service (SMS)

#### 11.3.9.1 Delivering SMS to the voice group call

If the talking service subscriber, the listening service subscriber, the
dispatcher in a voice group call, or any initiator of short messages who
is not part of the voice group call wants to send a short message to the
voice group call, it shall use the numbering scheme based on
ITU‑T Recommendation E.164 as the destination address illustrated below.

  -------- --------- ------------ --------------------------
  **CC**   **NDC**   **Prefix**   **Group call reference**
  -------- --------- ------------ --------------------------

The Country Code (CC) and National Destination Code (NDC) are used as
normal for routing purposes. The CC and NDC may be omitted for internal
SMS. The Subscriber Number (SN) is used to indicate:

> \- the request of an SMS to a voice group call by use of a prefix. The
> length of the prefix shall be 1 to 2 digits. The value of the prefix
> shall be the same as the value used by a dispatcher when originating
> the voice group call (see subclause 9.2 d);

\- the wanted group call reference as defined in subclause 9.1.

When receiving the short message, the SC may send Delivery Report
message containing the received group call reference of the voice group
to the sender of the short message, and furthermore the SC shall attempt
to deliver the short message to the voice group call addressed by the
group call reference. Figure 7k shows the MT SMS delivery procedure.

![](media/image61.png){width="6.638194444444444in"
height="6.310416666666667in"}

Figure 7k: Successful MT short message transfer attempt to a voice group
call

1\) The SC sends a Message Transfer message to forward a short message
to the SMS-GMSC.

2\) The SMS-GMSC sends the MT\_ForwardSM\_For\_VGCS\_REQ message to
transfer the received short message to the anchor MSC using the routing
information derived from the group call reference.

3\) The anchor MSC sends the GCR\_SMS\_Interrogation message to the GCR
to retrieve the voice group call attributes for short message transfer.

4\) The GCR sends the GCR\_SMS\_Interrogation\_Res message to the anchor
MSC containing the voice group call status and optionally the list of
identities of dispatchers.\
In RANflex configuration with Group Call redundancy message 4 may
indicate that the group call is ongoing at another anchor MSC within the
redundancy pool. If so, message 2 is relayed to that anchor MSC (not
shown in figure 7k).

5\) The anchor MSC sends the MT\_ForwardSM\_For\_VGCS\_RES message to
the SMS-GMSC containing the status of the voice group call and
optionally a list of identities of dispatchers if received from the GCR.
Optionally, if the voice group call is currently ongoing, the SMS-GMSC
may initiate point to point short message transfer attempts to the
dispatchers of the voice group call.

6\) If the voice group call is established, the anchor MSC sends the
FORWARD\_GROUP CALL\_SIGNALLING message to deliver the short message to
all related relay MSCs in the voice group call.

7\) If the voice group call is established, the anchor MSC sends Message
Transfer message to deliver the short message to the MSs participating
in the voice group call within its MSC area.

8\) If the voice group call is established, the relay MSCs sends Message
Transfer message to deliver the short message to the MSs participating
in the voice group call within its MSC area.

#### 11.3.9.2 Point-to-point short message during an ongoing voice group call

In this subclause the term point-to-point short message is used for
mobile terminating short messages destined to a single subscriber and
for mobile originating short messages, regardless whether their final
destination is a single subscriber or a voice group call.

For the transmission and reception of point-to-point short messages via
CS domain during an ongoing voice group call, an MS and a network
supporting this functionality shall apply the procedures specified in
3GPP TS 23.040 \[14\] and 3GPP TS 24.011 \[15\] as follows:

a\) When the talking service subscriber is on a dedicated channel,
point-to-point short messages to be sent or received via the CS domain
shall be transmitted on the SACCH of the dedicated channel. If the
talking service subscriber requests to release the uplink while a short
message transfer is ongoing, the MS shall initiate the release of the
uplink and abort the transfer of the short message.

b\) When the talking service subscriber is on a voice group call
channel, the MS shall send mobile originating short messages via the CS
domain on the SACCH of the voice group call channel, if at least one of
the following conditions is fulfilled:

\- the short message is destined to the ongoing voice group call of the
talker;

\- the network broadcasts neither an SMS data confidentiality indication
nor an SMS guaranteed privacy indication on the NCH; or

\- the network broadcasts an SMS data confidentiality indication, but no
SMS guaranteed privacy indication on the NCH, and the voice group call
channel is ciphered.

> Otherwise the MS shall leave the voice group call, send the short
> message as specified in 3GPP TS 24.011 \[15\] and return to the group
> call in group receive mode afterwards, if possible.
>
> If the talking service subscriber requests to release the uplink while
> a short message transfer on the voice group call channel is ongoing,
> the MS shall initiate the release of the uplink and abort the transfer
> of the short message.

c\) When the talking service subscriber is on a voice group call
channel, the network may deliver mobile terminating point-to-point short
messages via the CS domain on the SACCH of the voice group call channel,
if at least one of the following conditions is fulfilled:

\- the network does not broadcast an SMS data confidentiality indication
on the NCH; or

\- the network broadcasts an SMS data confidentiality indication on the
NCH, and the voice group call channel is ciphered.

> Otherwise the network shall perform paging into the ongoing voice
> group call as described in subclause 11.3.1.3 c. The paging
> information on the FACCH of the voice group call channel shall
> indicate explicitly that the paging is for a short message. When the
> paging is received in group transmit mode, the reception of the paging
> shall be indicated to the subscriber. It is then up to the subscriber
> to respond to the paging or not. On request of the subscriber to
> respond to the paging, the MS in group transmit mode shall release the
> uplink, leave the voice group call, receive the short message as
> specified in 3GPP TS 24.011 \[15\], and return to the group call in
> group receive mode afterwards, if possible.
>
> If the talking service subscriber requests to release the uplink while
> a short message transfer on the voice group call channel is ongoing,
> the MS shall initiate the release of the uplink and abort the transfer
> of the short message.

d\) If an MS on a voice group call channel is not the endpoint of the
layer 2 link for acknowledged message transfer, it shall ignore
point-to-point short messages received on the SACCH of the voice group
call channel.

e\) On request of a listening service subscriber to send a
point-to-point short message, the MS in group receive mode shall leave
the voice group call, send the short message as specified in 3GPP TS
24.011 \[15\], and return to the group call in group receive mode
afterwards, if possible.

> For the delivery of a point-to-point short message to a listening
> service subscriber, the network shall peform paging into ongoing voice
> group calls by means of the notification procedure as described in
> subclause 11.3.1.3. The notification messages on the FACCH of the
> voice group call channel shall indicate explicitly that the paging is
> for a short message. When the paging is received in group receive
> mode, the reception of the paging shall be indicated to the
> subscriber. It is then up to the subscriber to respond to the paging
> or not. On request of the subscriber to respond to the paging, the MS
> in group receive mode shall leave the voice group call, receive the
> short message as specified in 3GPP TS 24.011 \[15\], and return to the
> group call in group receive mode afterwards, if possible.

For the transmission and reception of point-to-point short messages via
PS domain during an ongoing voice group call, class A mobile stations
supporting this functionality shall apply the procedures specified in
3GPP TS 23.040 \[14\] and 3GPP TS 24.011 \[15\].

Editor\'s note: For DTM mobile stations the transmission and reception
of point-to-point short messages via PS domain during an ongoing voice
group call is ffs.

11.4 Functional requirement of Anchor MSC
-----------------------------------------

The VGCS handling process in the anchor MSC is shown in figure 8.

**Successful call set-up**

When the VGCS handling process in the anchor MSC receives a VGCS call
set-up request from either a dispatcher or a service subscriber
currently located in the anchor MSC\'s area or a service subscriber
currently located in a relay MSC\'s area, or - in a RANflex
configuration or in a RANflex configuration with group call redundancy -
from a service subscriber currently registered in a VMSC, it
interrogates its associated GCR to retrieve the group call attributes,
and waits for a response.

If the GCR returns a positive response containing the group call
attributes, the anchor MSC

> sets up the downlinks to the cells inside the MSC area of the group
> call anchor MSC into which the call is to be sent.; If the \"talker
> channel parameter\" is used, the anchor MSC shall additionally send
> the parameter to the affected BSCs;
>
> sets up the connections to the dispatchers to which a dedicated link
> is to be established;
>
> sets up the connections to the relay MSCs or relay MSC redundancy
> pools into which the call is to be sent;
>
> starts the No Activity Timer;
>
> sends Forward Group Call Signalling messages to all selected relay
> MSCs if the call was not initiated by a dispatcher (however in a
> non-RANflex configuration not to the relay MSC from which the IMSI was
> received within the Send Group Call End Signal message if the call was
> initiated by a service subscriber located in the relay MSC area). The
> Forward Group Call Signalling messages shall contain the IMSI, talker
> priority and additional information of the service subscriber who has
> initiated the call. In a RANflex configuration and in a RANflex
> configuration with group call redundancy, simultaneous group call
> setup of two service subscribers may result in two Send Group Call End
> Signal messages being received by the anchor MSC from two different
> relay MSCs, with both messages containing an IMSI. In this situation
> the anchor MSC shall discard the IMSI received from the relay MSC
> whose MSC address does not match the generic number with the number
> qualifier indicator set to \"additional calling party number\" from
> the IAM received and accepted from the originating MSC.

NOTE: In a network configuration involving also pre-Rel-7 relay MSCs,
the IAM sent by such a relay MSC as originating MSC will not include a
generic number parameter. If the anchor MSC accepts the IAM from the
pre-Rel-7 relay MSC and receives further IAM(s) including a generic
number with number qualifier indicator set to \"additional calling party
number\", the anchor MSC can store these additional calling party
numbers in a list and discard the IMSI received with a Send Group Call
End Signal message from a relay MSC whose MSC address matches any of the
numbers in the list.

> If the network supports talker priorities, the anchor MSC includes the
> talker priority of the service subscriber who has initiated the call
> in the Forward Group Call Signalling messages; and
>
> waits for uplink management messages.

**Procedure Set-up Connections to Relay MSCs and BSCs**

The procedure is shown in figure 9.

The procedure

\- sets up the downlinks to the cells inside the MSC area of the group
call anchor MSC into which the call is to be sent. If the network
supports talker priorities, the anchor MSC additionally sends the talker
priority of the service subscriber who has initiated the call and, if
applicable, the \"emergency mode indication\" with Uplink Seized Command
messages\" to the affected BSCs;

\- sends PREPARE\_GROUP\_CALL messages to all relay MSCs (in a RANflex
configuration with group call redundancy: to all group call relay MSC
redundancy pools) and waits for the responses. If the \"talker channel
parameter\" is used, the anchor MSC shall include this parameter in the
PREPARE\_GROUP\_CALL messages.

If a positive response containing a Group Call number is received from a
relay MSC, the anchor MSC constructs an IAM using the Group Call number
as called party address, sends it to the relay MSC and waits for the
SEND\_GROUP CALL\_END\_SIGNAL message.

If a SEND\_GROUP\_CALL\_END\_SIGNAL message without IMSI is received
from a relay MSC, this indicates to the anchor MSC that at least one
downlink to a cell has been successfully connected in the relay MSC
area.

If the call was originated by a service subscriber in a relay MSC area
and a SEND\_GROUP\_CALL\_END\_SIGNAL message with the IMSI of the
originator is received from this relay MSC, this indicates to the anchor
MSC that the downlink to the originating cell has been successfully
connected. If the negative response on the PREPARE\_GROUP\_CALL message
is received from originating relay MSC, the call shall be released.

Relay MSCs (in a RANflex configuration with group call redundancy: relay
MSC redundancy pools) that do not send positive responses to the
PREPARE\_GROUP\_CALL message are no longer considered to belong to the
list of relay MSCs (or relay MSC redundancy pools) for this VGCS call.

If, after receipt of a positive response containing a Group Call number
from a relay MSC, the anchor MSC receives an ABORT from the relay MSC,
the relay MSC or relay MSC redundancy pool will no longer be considered
to belong to the list of relay MSCs or relay MSC redundancy pools for
this VGCS call.

Optionally in both cases the anchor MSC may retry to establish the
connection to the relay MSC or relay MSC redundancy pool, instead of no
longer considering the relay MSC or relay MSC redundancy pool to belong
to the list of relay MSCs or relay MSC redundancy pools.

If an ABORT message is received from the relay MSC or relay MSC
redundancy pool the anchor MSC releases the connection, established with
the Group Call number, to the relay MSC or relay MSC redundancy pool and
the relay MSC or relay MSC redundancy pool is no longer considered to
belong to the list of relay MSCs or relay MSC redundancy pools for this
VGCS call.

If a Release message for the connection established with the Group Call
number is received from a relay MSC or relay MSC redundancy pool, then
the anchor MSC sends an ABORT message to that relay MSC or relay MSC
redundancy pool and the relay MSC or relay MSC redundancy pool is no
longer considered to belong to the list of relay MSCs or relay MSC
redundancy pools for this VGCS call.

**Unsuccessful call set-up**

If the call set-up is unsuccessful (i.e. conditions for call
establishment have not been met as per subclause 11.3.1.1.2) the anchor
MSC sends a SEND\_GROUP\_CALL\_END\_SIGNAL\_ACK message or ABORT
(depending on the state of the MAP dialogue) to all relay MSCs, releases
the connections to the relay MSCs, releases all connections to
dispatchers, all downlinks to cells inside the anchor MSC area are
released, the GCR is informed that the call is no longer on-going and
the process returns to the idle state.

**Negative response received from the GCR**

If the GCR returns a negative response to the anchor MSC indicating that
the call is already on-going locally i.e. at the associated MSC, the
anchor MSC checks whether the new call was initiated by a dispatcher. If
so, the dispatcher is connected to the on-going call and the process
returns to the idle state. If the new call was initiated by a service
subscriber, a Release message indicating \"user busy\" is returned in
order to force the mobile station of the service subscriber to look for
notifications of the respective group ID on the NCH and join the group
call.

If (in a RANflex configuration with group call redundancy) the GCR
returns a negative response to the selected anchor MSC indicating that
the call is already on-going at another MSC within the group call anchor
MSC redundancy pool, the selected anchor MSC checks whether the new call
was initiated by a dispatcher or a service subscriber served by another
VMSC. If so, the selected anchor MSC forwards the call setup request to
the anchor MSC where the group call is ongoing (possibly using a special
prefix for the called party number). The selected anchor MSC then acts
as a transit node unless it recognizes that the anchor MSC where the
group call is ongoing is out of service. In the latter case the selected
anchor MSC repeats the GCR interrogation including \"ongoing call
override indication\". If the call was initiated by a service subscriber
served by the selected anchor MSC, the selected anchor MSC interrogates
the anchor MSC where the group call is ongoing by means of the MAP
service SEND\_GROUP\_CALL\_INFO and waits for a response. If the
selected anchor MSC recognizes that the anchor MSC where the group call
is ongoing is out of service or if that anchor MSC responds with a
positive SEND\_GROUP\_CALL\_INFO response (i.e. the GCRs are out of
synch and the group call at the other anchor MSC is not ongoing), then
the selected anchor MSC repeats the GCR interrogation including
\"ongoing call override indication\". If the anchor MSC where the group
call is ongoing responds with a negative SEND\_GROUP\_CALL\_INFO
response (ongoing call), then the selected anchor MSC returns a Release
message indicating \"user busy\" in order to force the mobile station of
the service subscriber to look for notifications of the respective group
ID on the NCH and join the group call.

If the negative response from the GCR indicates any other reason than
\"on-going call\" the VGCS call set-up request is rejected by sending a
release message back to the initiator and the process returns to the
idle state.

**Uplink management**

If an anchor MSC not supporting talker priorities receives an Uplink
Release Indication message from a BSC, the anchor MSC marks the uplink
as free, sends Forward Group Call Signalling messages indicating
\"uplink release indication\" to all relay MSCs, sends Uplink Release
command messages to all other BSCs, restarts the No Activity Timer and
waits for further uplink management messages.

If an anchor MSC supporting talker priorities receives an Uplink Release
Indication message from a BSC, the anchor MSC compares the talker
priority included in the Uplink Release Indication with the stored
talker priority. If they are equal, the anchor MSC proceeds as specified
above for the anchor MSC not supporting talker priorities; otherwise the
anchor MSC discards the Uplink Release Indication.

If the anchor MSC receives an Uplink Request message without talker
priority or with talker priority \"normal subscriber\" from a BSC, it
checks whether the uplink is marked as free. If so, an Uplink Request
Acknowledge message is returned to the BSC, Forward Group Call
Signalling messages indicating that the uplink is no longer free are
sent to all relay MSCs, Uplink Seized Command messages are sent to all
other BSCs, the uplink is marked busy and the process waits for further
uplink management messages. If the uplink was not free when receiving
the Uplink Request message, the request is rejected.

If an anchor MSC supporting talker priorities receives an Uplink Request
message with a talker priority higher than \"normal subscriber\" from a
BSC, and the uplink is free or it was seized by the current talker with
a lower talker priority, the anchor MSC checks whether the subscriber
has the subscription for the requested talker priority for this group
ID. In a RANflex configuration (with or without group call redundancy)
this check may require retrieval of information from the visited MSC/VLR
by means of the MAP service SEND\_GROUP\_CALL\_INFO. If so, the anchor
MSC:

\- stores the received data;

\- sends Forward Group Call Signalling messages indicating \"uplink
seized command\" with the requested talker priority to the relay MSCs;

\- returns an Uplink Request Acknowledge message with the requested
talker priority to the BSC which has requested the uplink;

\- sends Uplink Seized Command messages with the requested talker
priority to all other BSCs;

\- releases the current talker by sending a Clear Command message, if
the talker is on a dedicated channel and is located in the anchor MSC;

\- marks the uplink busy; and

\- waits for further uplink management messages.

Additionally,

\- if the requested talker priority is \"emergency subscriber\", the
anchor MSC sets the emergency mode and includes the \"emergency mode
indication\" in the Uplink Request Acknowledge message and the Uplink
Seized Command messages; furthermore the anchor MSC alerts all active
dispatchers with an appropriate emergency indication (e.g. in-band tone
or announcement); furthermore the anchor MSC alerts all inactive
dispatchers by setting up dedicated connections with an appropriate
emergency indication (e.g. special CLI prefix or postfix, and in-band
tone or announcement) and connects the dispatchers to the voice group
call.

\- if the anchor MSC supports the transmission of additional
subscriber-related information, it interrogates the VLR to get the
\"additional information\" assigned to the new talker. In a RANflex
configuration (with or without group call redundancy) this may require
retrieval of information from the visited MSC/VLR by means of the MAP
service SEND\_GROUP\_CALL\_INFO. If \"additional information\" is
available, the anchor MSC includes the \"additional information\" in the
Forward Group Call Signalling messages indicating \"uplink seized
command\" to all relay MSCs and sends VGCS Additional Info messages to
all BSCs involved in the call and connected to the anchor MSC.
Furthermore, the anchor MSC sends a VGCS Additional Info message on the
dedicated connection to the BSC serving the current talker, before it
releases the current talker.

If an anchor MSC supporting talker priorities receives an Uplink Request
message with a talker priority higher than \"normal subscriber\" from a
BSC, and the uplink was seized by the current talker with the same or a
higher talker priority, then the anchor MSC sends an Uplink Reject
Command message with the current talker priority to the BSC.

If the anchor MSC receives an Uplink Request Confirm message from a BSC,
it stores the received data and waits for further uplink management
messages. Additionally, if the anchor MSC supports the transmission of
additional subscriber-related information, it interrogates the VLR to
get the \"additional information\" assigned to the subscriber. In a
RANflex configuration (with or without group call redundancy) this
interrogation may require retrieval of information from the visited
MSC/VLR by means of the MAP service SEND\_GROUP\_CALL\_INFO. If
\"additional information\" is available, the relay MSC sends VGCS
Additional Info messages to all BSCs involved in the call and connected
to this relay MSC, and Forward Group Call Signalling messages with the
additional info to all relay MSCs.

If an anchor MSC supporting talker priorities receives an Emergency
Reset Indication from a BSC and the subscription check is successful,
the anchor MSC resets the emergency mode, sends Emergency Reset Command
messages to all BSCs involved in the call and connected to the anchor
MSC, and Forward Group Call Signalling messages indicating \"emergency
reset command\" to all relay MSCs. If the talker priority at receipt of
the Emergency Reset Indication is \"emergency subscriber\", then it is
changed in the anchor MSC to \"normal subscriber\"; furthermore the
anchor MSC alerts all active dispatchers with an appropriate emergency
indication (e.g. in-band tone or announcement); furthermore the anchor
MSC alerts all inactive dispatchers by setting up dedicated connections
with an appropriate emergency indication (e.g. special CLI prefix or
postfix, and in-band tone or announcement) and connects the dispatchers
to the voice group call.

If an anchor MSC not supporting talker priorities receives a Process
Group Call Signalling message indicating \"uplink release indication\"
from a relay MSC , the anchor MSC marks the uplink as free, sends
Forward Group Call Signalling messages indicating \"uplink release
indication\" to all other relay MSCs, sends Uplink Release command
messages to all BSCs, restarts the No Activity Timer and waits for
further uplink management messages. If there is a dedicated connection
for the talking service subscriber between the relay MSC and the anchor
MSC, the anchor MSC shall release this connection with cause \'normal,
unspecified'.

If an anchor MSC supporting talker priorities receives a Process Group
Call Signalling message indicating \"uplink release indication\" from a
relay MSC, the anchor MSC compares the talker priority included in the
Process Group Call Signalling message with the stored talker priority.
If they are equal, the anchor MSC proceeds as specified above for the
anchor MSC not supporting talker priorities; otherwise the anchor MSC
discards the Process Group Call Signalling message.

If the anchor MSC receives a Process Group Call Signalling message from
a relay MSC indicating \"uplink request\" without talker priority or
with talker priority \"normal subscriber\", it checks whether the uplink
is marked as free. If so, a Forward Group Call Signalling message
indicating \"uplink request acknowledgement\" is returned to the relay
MSC, Forward Group Call Signalling messages indicating that the uplink
is no longer free are sent to all other relay MSCs, Uplink Seized
Command messages are sent to all BSCs, the uplink is marked busy and the
process waits for further uplink management messages. If the uplink was
not free when receiving the Process Group Call Signalling message
(Uplink Request), the request is rejected.

If an anchor MSC supporting talker priorities receives a Process Group
Call Signalling message from a relay MSC indicating \"uplink request\"
with a talker priority higher than \"normal subscriber\", and the uplink
is free or it was seized by the current talker with a lower talker
priority, then the anchor MSC:

\- returns a Forward Group Call Signalling message indicating \"uplink
request acknowledgement\" with the requested talker priority to the
relay MSC;

\- sends Forward Group Call Signalling messages indicating \"uplink
seized command\" and the requested talker priority to all other relay
MSCs;

\- sends Uplink Seized Command messages with the requested talker
priority to all BSSs involved in the call;

\- releases the current talker by sending a Clear Command message, if
the talker is on a dedicated channel and is located in the anchor MSC;

\- marks the uplink as busy; and

\- waits for further uplink management messages.

Additionally,

\- if the requested talker priority in the Process Group Call Signalling
message from the relay MSC is \"emergency subscriber\", the anchor MSC
sets the emergency mode and includes the \"emergency mode indication\"
in the Uplink Seized Command messages; furthermore the anchor MSC alerts
all active dispatchers with an appropriate emergency indication (e.g.
in-band tone or announcement); furthermore the anchor MSC alerts all
inactive dispatchers by setting up dedicated connections with an
appropriate emergency indication (e.g. special CLI prefix or postfix,
and in-band tone or announcement) and connects the dispatchers to the
voice group call.

\- if \"additional information\" about the new talker was included in
the Process Group Call Signalling message from the relay MSC, the anchor
MSC includes the \"additional information\" in the Forward Group Call
Signalling messages indicating \"uplink seized command\" to all other
relay MSCs and sends VGCS Additional Info messages to all BSCs involved
in the call and connected to the anchor MSC. Furthermore, the anchor MSC
sends a VGCS Additional Info message on the dedicated connection to the
BSC serving the current talker, before it releases the current talker.

If an anchor MSC supporting talker priorities receives a Process Group
Call Signalling message from a relay MSC indicating \"uplink request\"
with a talker priority higher than \"normal subscriber\", and the uplink
was seized by the current talker with the same or a higher talker
priority, then the anchor MSC returns a Forward Group Call Signalling
message indicating \"uplink reject command\" with the current talker
priority to the relay MSC.

If the anchor MSC receives a Process Group Call Signalling message with
\"additional info\" from a relay MSC, the anchor MSC sends VGCS
Additional Info messages to all BSCs involved in the group call and
connected to the anchor MSC, and Forward Group Call Signalling messages
with \"additional info\" to all other relay MSCs.

If an anchor MSC supporting talker priorities receives a Process Group
Call Signalling message with \"emergency mode reset command\" from a
relay MSC, the anchor MSC resets the emergency mode, sends Forward Group
Call Signalling messages with \"emergency mode reset command\" to all
other relay MSCs, and sends Emergency Reset Command messages to all BSCs
involved in the call and connected to the anchor MSC. If the talker
priority at receipt of the \"emergency mode reset command\" is
\"emergency subscriber\", then it is changed in the anchor MSC to
\"normal subscriber\"; furthermore the anchor MSC alerts all active
dispatchers with an appropriate emergency indication (e.g. in-band tone
or announcement); furthermore the anchor MSC alerts all inactive
dispatchers by setting up dedicated connections with an appropriate
emergency indication (e.g. special CLI prefix or postfix, and in-band
tone or announcement) and connects the dispatchers to the voice group
call.

If the anchor MSC receives an ABORT message from a relay MSC, the
connection to the relay MSC is released and the relay MSC is no longer
considered to be part of the call.

**Call release**

If the anchor MSC receives a termination request from an entitled
dispatcher (see figures 7b to 7d) or a Termination Request message from
the initiating service subscriber who currently has access to the
uplink, it sends Send Group Call End Signal ACK messages to all relay
MSCs, sends Release messages to all relay MSCs, sends Release messages
to all dispatchers and BSCs, informs the GCR that the call is no longer
on-going and the process returns to the idle state. If the group call
termination is initiated by an entitled dispatcher, and there is a
dedicated connection for the talking service subscriber between the
anchor MSC and the relay MSC, the anchor MSC shall release this
connection with cause \'normal call clearing'.

If the anchor MSC receives a Process Group Call Signalling message from
a relay MSC indicating \"release group call\" or an ISUP Release message
from a relay MSC indicating \"Normal call clearing\" for the calling
service subscriber's dedicated connection to the anchor MSC, then the
anchor MSC sends Send Group Call End Signal ACK messages to all relay
MSCs, sends Release messages to all relay MSCs, sends Release messages
to all dispatchers and BSCs, informs the GCR that the call is no longer
on-going and the process returns to the idle state.

If the anchor MSC receives an ISUP Release message from a relay MSC with
cause value other than \"Normal call clearing\" for the calling service
subscribers dedicated connection to the anchor MSC, then the anchor MSC
shall send Uplink Release Command messages to all BSCs and Forward Group
Call Signalling messages with Uplink Release Indication parameter to all
relay MSCs.

If the no activity time in the anchor MSC expires, i.e. \"no activity\"
(as specified in subclause 8.1.2.3) has been detected for the time
specified in the GCR, the anchor MSC sends Send Group Call End Signal
ACK messages to all relay MSCs, sends Release messages to all relay
MSCs, sends Release messages to all dispatchers and BSCs, informs the
GCR that the call is no longer on-going and the process returns to the
idle state.

**SM MT delivery**

When the VGCS handling process in the anchor MSC receives an
MT\_ForwardSM\_for\_VGCS\_REQ message from a SMS-GMSC, the anchor MSC
shall interrogate the GCR to retrieve the group call attributes for
short message transfer. The anchor MSC shall deliver to the SMS-GMSC the
status of the voice group call and optionally a list of identities of
dispatchers within the MT\_ForwardSM\_for\_VGCS\_RES message.

If the voice group call is established, the anchor MSC shall distribute
the short message TPDU to all connected relay MSCs using the
FORWARD\_GROUP CALL\_SIGNALLING message and shall deliver the short
message to the relevant cells using the already established downlink
channel for the voice group call.

If the voice group call is not established, the anchor MSC shall discard
the short message TPDU.

Figure 9: Procedure Set-up Connections to Relay MSCs and BSCs (sheet 1
of 1)

11.5 Functional requirement of Relay MSC
----------------------------------------

The VGCS handling process in the relay MSC is shown in figure 10.

**Successful call set-up initiated by a service subscriber**

When the VGCS handling process in the relay MSC receives a VGCS call
set-up request from a service subscriber currently located in a relay
MSC\'s area, it interrogates its associated GCR to retrieve the anchor
MSC address and waits for a response.

If the GCR returns a positive response containing the anchor MSC
address, the relay MSC sets up a dedicated connection for the initiating
service subscriber to the anchor MSC by constructing an IAM with calling
party number set to VGCS prefix plus group call reference, and with a
generic number parameter with the number qualifier indicator set to
\"additional calling party number\" and address signal set to the
address of this relay MSC, sending it to the anchor MSC, and waits for
call release.

**Negative response received from the GCR**

If the GCR returns a negative response to the relay MSC indicating that
the call is already on-going locally, i.e. at the associated MSC, the
relay MSC sends a Release message indicating \"user busy\" to the
service subscriber in order to force the mobile station of the service
subscriber to look for notifications of the respective group ID on the
NCH and join the group call.

If (in a RANflex configuration with group call redundancy) the GCR
returns a negative response to the relay MSC indicating that the call is
already on-going at another MSC within the group call relay MSC
redundancy pool, the selected relay MSC interrogates the relay MSC where
the group call is ongoing by means of the MAP service
SEND\_GROUP\_CALL\_INFO and waits for a response. If the selected relay
MSC recognizes that the relay MSC where the group call is ongoing is out
of service or if that relay MSC responds with a positive
SEND\_GROUP\_CALL\_INFO response (i.e. the GCRs are out of synch and the
group call at the other relay MSC is not ongoing), then the selected
relay MSC repeats the GCR interrogation including \"ongoing call
override indication\". If the relay MSC where the group call is ongoing
responds with a negative SEND\_GROUP\_CALL\_INFO response (ongoing
call), then the selected relay MSC returns a Release message indicating
\"user busy\" in order to force the mobile station of the service
subscriber to look for notifications of the respective group ID on the
NCH and join the group call.

If the negative response from the GCR indicates any other reason than
\"on-going call\" the VGCS call set-up request is rejected by sending a
release message back to the initiator and the process returns to the
idle state.

**Successful call set-up initiated by the anchor MSC**

When the VGCS handling process in the relay MSC receives a
PREPARE\_GROUP\_CALL message from the anchor MSC, it interrogates its
associated GCR to retrieve the list of cells inside the relay MSC area
into which the call is to be sent.

If the GCR returns a positive response, the relay MSC requests a Group
Call number from its VLR.

If the VLR returns a Group Call number, a PREPARE\_GROUP CALL
acknowledgement containing the Group Call number is returned to the
anchor MSC and the relay MSC waits for the incoming call.

If the incoming call identified by the Group Call number is received,
the relay MSC releases the Group Call number and sets up the downlinks
to the cells inside the relay MSC area into which the call is to be
sent.

If the \"talker channel parameter\" is used, the relay MSC shall
additionally send the parameter to the affected BSCs

If the network supports talker priorities and the group call was
initiated by a service subscriber currently located in the relay MSC\'s
area, then the relay MSC additionally sends the talker priority of the
service subscriber who has initiated the call and, if applicable, the
\"emergency mode indication\" with Uplink Seized Command messages to the
affected BSCs.

If the group call was initiated by a service subscriber currently
located in the relay MSC\'s area, then the relay MSC shall send a
SEND\_GROUP\_CALL\_END\_SIGNAL message, including the IMSI and
additional information of the service subscriber, to the anchor MSC when
the downlink has been set up successfully to the originating cell.
Additionally, if the network supports talker priorities, the relay MSC
includes the talker priority of the service subscriber in the
SEND\_GROUP\_CALL\_END\_SIGNAL message.

In a RANflex configuration, the IMSI, talker priority and additional
information (initial talker information) shall be deleted by the relay
MSC after sending SEND\_GROUP\_CALL\_END\_SIGNAL. If initial talker
information is received in a subsequent FORWARD\_GROUP\_CALL\_SIGNALLING
message, the relay MSC shall use this information for the voice group
call.

NOTE: The initial talker information sent within
SEND\_GROUP\_CALL\_END\_SIGNAL can be invalid, e.g. due to a race
condition, if the voice group call is simulateously set up by a
dispatcher or another service subscriber.

If the call was not originated by a service subscriber from the relay
MSC area, the relay MSC shall send a SEND\_GROUP\_CALL\_END\_SIGNAL
message without IMSI information element to the anchor MSC as soon as a
downlink has been set up successfully to any cell.

Then the relay MSC waits for uplink management messages.

**Negative response received from the GCR II**

If the GCR returns a negative response to the relay MSC, the relay MSC
returns a PREPARE\_GROUP\_CALL negative response to the anchor MSC and
returns to the idle state.

**No Group Call number received from VLR**

If the VLR could not allocate a Group Call number, the relay MSC returns
a PREPARE\_GROUP CALL\_CALL negative response to the anchor MSC, informs
the GCR that the call is no longer on-going and returns to the idle
state.

**Abort received from VLR**

If the VLR indicates that the Group Call number supervision timer has
expired, the relay MSC sends an ABORT message to the anchor MSC, informs
the GCR that the call is no longer on-going and returns to the idle
state.

**Abort received from Anchor MSC**

If, after returning a PREPARE\_GROUP\_CALL acknowledgement containing
the Group Call number, an ABORT is received from the anchor MSC the
relay MSC releases the Group Call number, informs the GCR that the call
is no longer on-going and returns to the idle state.

Abort initiated by Relay MSC

The relay MSC may Abort the dialogue by sending an ABORT message to the
anchor MSC(e.g. if the relay MSC fails to establish any downlinks in its
area). The relay MSC also releases any resources, informs the GCR that
the call is no longer on-going and returns to the idle state.

**Unsuccessful call set-up**

Unsuccessful call set-up is determined in the anchor MSC (as per
subclause 11.3.1.1.2). The relay MSC follows the procedures specified
for **\"**Abort received from Anchor MSC**\"** and **\"**Call
release**\"**.

**Uplink management**

If a relay MSC not supporting talker priorities receives an Uplink
Release Indication message from a BSC, the relay MSC marks the uplink as
free, sends a Process Group Call Signalling message indicating \"uplink
release indication\" to the anchor MSC, sends Uplink Release Command
messages to all other BSCs, and waits for further uplink management
messages.

NOTE: If there is a dedicated connection for the talking service
subscriber between the relay MSC and the anchor MSC, the anchor MSC will
release this connection with cause \'normal, unspecified'.

If a relay MSC supporting talker priorities receives an Uplink Release
Indication message from a BSC, the relay MSC compares the talker
priority included in the Uplink Release Indication with the stored
talker priority. If they are equal, the relay MSC proceeds as specified
above for the relay MSC not supporting talker priorities, except that it
includes the talker priority in the Process Group Call Signalling
message to the anchor MSC; otherwise the relay MSC discards the Uplink
Release Indication.

If the relay MSC receives an Uplink Request message without talker
priority or with talker priority \"normal subscriber\" from a BSC, the
relay MSC checks whether the uplink is marked as free. If so, a Process
Group Call Signalling message indicating \"uplink request\" is sent to
the anchor MSC, Uplink Seized Command messages are sent to all other
BSCs, the uplink is marked busy and the process waits for further uplink
management messages. If the uplink was not free when receiving the
Uplink Request, the request is rejected.

If a relay MSC supporting talker priorities receives an Uplink Request
message with a talker priority higher than \"normal subscriber\" from a
BSC and the uplink is free or it was seized by the current talker with a
lower talker priority, the relay MSC checks whether the subscriber has
the subscription for the requested talker priority for that group ID. In
a RANflex configuration and in a RANflex configuration with group call
redundancy this check may require retrieval of information from the
visited MSC/VLR by means of the MAP service SEND\_GROUP\_CALL\_INFO. If
so, the relay MSC:

\- stores the received data;

\- sends a Process Group Call Signalling message indicating \"uplink
request\" and the requested talker priority to the anchor MSC;

\- sends Uplink Seized Command messages with the requested talker
priority to all other BSCs involved in the call and connected to this
relay MSC;

\- releases the current talker by sending a Clear Command message, if
the talker is on a dedicated channel and is located in this relay MSC;

\- marks the uplink as busy; and

\- waits for further uplink management messages.

Additionally,

\- if the requested talker priority is \"emergency subscriber\", the
relay MSC sets the emergency mode and includes the \"emergency mode
indication\" in the Uplink Seized Command messages;

\- if the relay MSC supports the transmission of additional
subscriber-related information, it interrogates the VLR to get the
\"additional information\" assigned to the new talker. In a RANflex
configuration and in a RANflex configuration with group call redundancy
this may require retrieval of information from the visited MSC/VLR by
means of the MAP service SEND\_GROUP\_CALL\_INFO. If \"additional
information\" is available, the relay MSC includes the \"additional
information\" in the Process Group Call Signalling message indicating
\"uplink request\" to the anchor MSC.

If a relay MSC supporting talker priorities receives an Uplink Request
message with a talker priority higher than \"normal subscriber\" from a
BSC, and the uplink was seized by the current talker with the same or a
higher talker priority, then the relay MSC sends an Uplink Reject
Command message with the current talker priority to the BSC.

If the relay MSC receives an Uplink Request Confirm message from a BSC,
it stores the data and waits for further uplink management messages.
Additionally, if the relay MSC supports the transmission of additional
subscriber-related information, it interrogates the VLR to get the
\"additional information\" assigned to the subscriber. In a RANflex
configuration and in a RANflex configuration with group call redundancy
this interrogation may require retrieval of information from the visited
MSC/VLR by means of the MAP service SEND\_GROUP\_CALL\_INFO. If
\"additional information\" is available, the relay MSC sends VGCS
Additional Info messages to all BSCs involved in the call and connected
to this relay MSC, and a Forward Group Call Signalling message with the
additional info to the anchor MSC.

If a relay MSC supporting talker priorities receives an Emergency Reset
Indication from a BSC and the subscription check is successful, the
relay MSC sends a Progress Group Call Signalling message with
\"emergency mode reset command\" to the anchor MSC and Emergency Reset
Command messages to all BSCs involved in the call and connected to this
relay MSC, and waits for further uplink management messages. If the
talker priority at receipt of the Emergency Reset Indication is
\"emergency subscriber\", then it is changed in the relay MSC to
\"normal subscriber\".

If the relay MSC receives a Forward Group Call Signalling message from a
anchor MSC indicating \"uplink release indication\", it marks the uplink
as free, sends Uplink Release command messages to all BSCs and waits for
further uplink management messages.

If the relay MSC receives a Forward Group Call Signalling message from a
anchor MSC indicating \"uplink seized command\" with or without talker
priority, then the relay MSC

marks the uplink as busy,

sends Uplink Seized Command messages with the requested talker priority
to all BSCs involved in the call and connected to this relay MSC;

\- releases the current talker by sending a Clear Command message, if
the talker is on a dedicated channel and is located in this relay MSC;
and

\- waits for further uplink management messages.

Additionally,

\- if the Forward Group Call Signalling message from the anchor MSC
contained the talker priority \"emergency subscriber\", the relay MSC
sets the emergency mode and includes the \"emergency mode indication\"
in the Uplink Seized Command messages;

\- if \"additional information\" about the new talker was included in
the Forward Group Call Signalling message from the anchor MSC, the relay
MSC sends VGCS Additional Info messages to all BSCs involved in the call
and connected to the relay MSC. Furthermore, the relay MSC sends a VGCS
Additional Info message on the dedicated connection to the BSC serving
the current talker, before it releases the current talker.

If the relay MSC receives a Forward Group Call Signalling message with
the \"additional info\", the relay MSC sends VGCS Additional Info
message to all BSCs involved in the group call and connected to this
relay MSC, and waits for further uplink management messages.

If the relay MSC receives a Forward Group Call Signalling message from
an anchor MSC indicating \"uplink reject command\" with or without
talker priority, it returns an Uplink Reject message to the BSC which
has requested the uplink and waits for further uplink management
messages. If the \"uplink reject command\" included a talker priority,
the relay MSC includes the talker priority in the Uplink Reject Command
message

If the relay MSC receives a Forward Group Call Signalling message from
an anchor MSC indicating \"uplink request acknowledgement\" with or
without talker priority, then the relay MSC

> \- returns an Uplink Request Acknowledge message with the requested
> talker priority to the BSC which has requested the uplink;
>
> \- sets up a dedicated connection for the new talker to the anchor MSC
> (implementation option);
>
> \- releases the current talker by sending a Clear Command message, if
> the talker is on a dedicated channel and is located in this relay MSC;
> and
>
> \- waits for further uplink management messages.

Additionally,

\- if the requested talker priority is \"emergency subscriber\", the
relay MSC includes the \"emergency mode indication\" in the Uplink
Request Acknowledge messages;

\- if \"additional information\" about the new talker is available, the
relay MSC sends VGCS Additional Info messages to all BSCs involved in
the call and connected to the relay MSC. Furthermore, the relay MSC
sends a VGCS Additional Info message on the dedicated connection to the
BSC serving the current talker, before it releases the current talker.

If a relay MSC supporting talker priorities receives a Forward Group
Call Signalling message with \"emergency mode reset command\" from the
anchor MSC, the relay MSC resets the emergency mode, sends Emergency
Reset Command messages to all BSCs involved in the call and connected to
this relay MSC, and waits for further uplink management messages. If the
talker priority at receipt of the \"emergency mode reset command\" is
\"emergency subscriber\", then it is changed in the relay MSC to
\"normal subscriber\".

If the relay MSC receives a Forward Group Call Signalling message from
an anchor MSC indicating \"uplink release command\", it sends an Uplink
Release Command message to the BSC which currently has access to the
uplink and waits for further uplink management messages.

If the relay MSC receives an ABORT message from a anchor MSC, it sends
release messages to all BSCs, informs the GCR that the call is no longer
on-going and the process returns to the idle state.

**Call release**

When receiving a release message, with cause \'normal call clearing'
from the anchor MSC for the dedicated connection which was set-up for
the initiating service subscriber located in the relay MSC area, the
relay MSC releases the connection to the service subscriber and the
process returns to the idle state.

When the initiating service subscriber releases the call while a
dedicated connection to the anchor MSC is established, the relay MSC
sends a release message with cause \'normal call clearing' for the
dedicated connection to the anchor MSC and the process returns to the
idle state.

When the initiating service subscriber releases the call, while on a
group call channel or a dedicated connection to the relay MSC, the relay
MSC sends a Process Group Call Signalling message to the anchor MSC
indicating \"release group call\" and waits for the Release message and
the Send Group Call End Signal Acknowledgement from the anchor MSC.

When receiving a Send Group Call End Signal Acknowledgement or ABORT
from the anchor MSC, or a release message for the connection that was
set up using the Group Call number, the relay MSC releases all downlinks
to cells inside the relay MSC area, informs the GCR that the call is no
longer on-going and the process returns to the idle state.

**SM MT delivery**

When the VGCS handling process in the relay MSC receives a
FORWARD\_GROUP CALL\_SIGNALLING message containing a short message TPDU
from the anchor MSC, the R-MSC shall deliver the short message to the
relevant cells using the already established downlink channel for the
voice group call.

11.5A Functional requirement of group call serving MSC (within a RANflex pool)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The process in the group call serving MSC is shown in figure 10A1.

The group call serving MSC is either the anchor MSC or a relay MSC.

**Successful call set-up initiated by a service subscriber**

When receiving a SEND\_GROUP\_CALL\_INFO interrogation request from a
VMSC, the group call serving MSC (in a RANflex configuration with group
call redundancy: the selected group call serving MSC) interrogates its
associated GCR to retrieve the Group Call Reference and the Anchor MSC
address from the given cell Id / Group Id pair and return this
information to the VMSC. The group call serving MSC shall temporarily
store in its associated GCR the initiating subscriber\'s talker
priority, his subscribed additional information, his IMSI as received in
the interrogation request from the VMSC and the originating cell id. The
group call serving MSC shall then wait for the group call being set up:\
If the group call serving MSC is the anchor MSC, it waits for an IAM
from the VMSC; if the group call serving MSC is a relay MSC, it waits
for a PREPARE\_GROUP\_CALL from the anchor MSC.\
Waiting for the group call being set up shall be supervised by a timer
T3.\
When receiving IAM from the visited MSC, timer T3 is stopped and
processing continues in the process VGCS\_Handling\_Anchor\_MSC after
reception of the VGCS call setup request in Idle state.\
When receiving PREPARE\_GROUP\_CALL from the anchor MSC, timer T3 is
stopped and processing continues in the process
VGCS\_Handling\_Relay\_MSC after reception of PREPARE GROUP CALL in Idle
state.

**Unsuccessful call set-up**

In a RANflex configuration: If the group call reference could not be
retrieved or the GCR returns a negative response indicating \"on-going
call\" to the group call serving MSC, an error indication is returned to
the VMSC and the process returns to the idle state.

In a RANflex configuration with group call redundancy: If the GCR
returns a negative response indicating \"on-going call\" to the group
call serving MSC, the group call serving MSC forwards the
SEND\_GROUP\_CALL\_INFO message within the same redundancy pool to the
group call serving MSC where the group call is ongoing.

If the selected group call serving MSC recognizes that the group call
serving MSC where the group call is ongoing is out of service or if that
group call serving MSC responds with a positive SEND\_GROUP\_CALL\_INFO
response (i.e. the GCRs are out of synch and the group call at the other
group call serving MSC is not ongoing), then the selected group call
serving MSC repeats the GCR interrogation including \"ongoing call
override indication\". If the group call serving MSC where the group
call is ongoing responds with a negative SEND\_GROUP\_CALL\_INFO
response (ongoing call), then the selected group call serving MSC
returns a negative SEND\_GROUP\_CALL\_INFO response indicating
\"ongoingGroupCall\" to the VMSC in order to force the mobile station of
the service subscriber to look for notifications of the respective group
ID on the NCH and join the group call.

At timeout of timer T3 the temporarily stored initiating subscriber\'s
talker priority, his subscribed additional information and his IMSI
shall be deleted from the GCR.

Figure 10A1: The VGCS handling process in the group call serving MSC
(sheet 1 of 2)

Figure 10A1: The VGCS handling process in the group call serving MSC
(sheet 2 of 2)

**Retrieval of VGCS subscription data**

The procedure in the group call serving MSC to retrieve subscription
information from the VMSC is shown in figure 10A2.

In a RANflex configuration with or without group call redundancy, if the
group call serving MSC receives an uplink request or a request to
transmit application-specific data, it determines from the NRI in the
requesting subscriber\'s TMSI whether it is the requesting subscriber\'s
VMSC.

If it is not, then the group call serving MSC retrieves the IMSI and
information about subscribed talker priorities from the VLR of the VMSC
by means of the MAP service SEND\_GROUP\_CALL\_INFO.

\- If a response is received from the VMSC, the procedure ends.

As an implementation option the group call serving MSC may initiate a
MAP Update\_Location\_Area procedure towards its VLR in order to
retrieve the subscriber data from the HLR. During this procedure the VLR
allocates a new TMSI including an NRI referring to the group call
serving MSC.

As an alternative implementation option the group call serving MSC may
store the TMSI temporarily together with the IMSI and the other
information received from the VLR of the VMSC and use these data for
subscription checks during subsequent talker requests. Use of the
temporary subscriber data may be limited e.g. to an implementation
dependent time or for an implementation dependent number of subsequent
talker requests. The group call serving MSC shall delete the temporary
subscriber data when the group call is released.

\- If no response is received or if the VMSC is out of service, the
group call serving MSC should initiate a MAP Update\_Location\_Area
procedure towards its VLR. During this procedure the MSC requests the MS
to provide its IMSI and the VLR allocates a new TMSI including an NRI
referring to the group call serving MSC. The group call serving MSC
checks whether the MS has the necessary subscription for the requested
action when the Update\_Location\_Area procedure is completed.

NOTE: As an operator option, for this case of a network internal
failure, the group call serving MSC can skip the MAP
Update\_Location\_Area procedure and perform the subscription check
using a backup subscription profile.

As an operator option, the group call serving MSC may proceed with the
handling of the request received from the MS, assuming that the MS has
the necessary subscription, and perform the Update\_Location\_Area
procedure in parallel. If the result of the subscription check after
completion of the Update\_Location\_Area procedure is negative and the
MS still has the uplink seized, the group call serving MSC shall
initiate an uplink release procedure.

**Implicit location update procedure**

The procedure for the implict location update in the group call serving
MSC is shown in figure 10A3.

Sheet 1: The procedures Check\_IMEI\_MSC, Obtain\_IMEI\_MSC,
Obtain\_IMSI\_MSC and Authenticate\_MSC are specified in
3GPP TS 23.018 \[18\].

11.5B Functional requirement of VMSC (within a RANflex pool)
------------------------------------------------------------

The process in the visited MSC is shown in figure 10B.

**Successful call set-up initiated by a service subscriber**

When the VGCS handling process in the originating MSC receives a VGCS
call set-up request from a service subscriber, the VMSC derives the
address of the group call serving MSC or group call serving MSC
redundancy pool from the requesting subscriber\'s current LAC. If the
VMSC is the group call serving MSC or belongs to the group call serving
MSC redundancy pool of the requesting subscriber\'s current LAC,
processing continues in the process VGCS\_Handling\_Anchor\_MSC or
VGCS\_Handling\_Relay\_MSC after reception of the VGCS call setup
request in Idle state. Otherwise, the visited MSC interrogates the group
call serving MSC by means of the MAP service SEND\_GROUP\_CALL\_INFO to
retrieve the anchor MSC address and Group Call Reference and waits for a
response.

If the group call serving MSC returns a positive response containing the
address of the anchor MSC or anchor MSC redundancy pool and the address
is different from the visited MSC\'s address, the originating MSC sets
up a dedicated connection for the initiating service subscriber to the
anchor MSC by constructing an IAM with calling party number set to VGCS
prefix plus group call reference, and with a generic number parameter
with the number qualifier indicator set to \"additional calling party
number\" and address signal set to the address of the group call serving
MSC (in a RANflex configuration with group call redundancy this shall be
the same address as used to route the SEND\_GROUP\_CALL\_INFO message ,
i.e. identifying the redundancy pool), sending it to the anchor MSC, and
waits for call release. If the VMSC is the anchor MSC or belongs to the
anchor MSC redundancy pool, processing continues in the process
VGCS\_Handling\_Anchor\_MSC after reception of the VGCS call setup
request in Idle state.

**Negative response received from the group call serving** **MSC**

If the group call serving MSC returns a negative response to the
originating MSC indicating that the call is already on-going, the
originating MSC sends a Release message indicating \"user busy\" to the
service subscriber in order to force the mobile station of the service
subscriber to look for notifications of the respective group ID on the
NCH and join the group call.

If the negative response from the group call serving MSC indicates any
other reason than \"on-going call\" the VGCS call set-up request is
rejected by sending a release message back to the initiator and the
process returns to the idle state.

11.6 Functional requirement of GCR
----------------------------------

The process in the GCR for RANflex and without RANflex configurations is
shown in figure 11.

The process in the GCR for RANflex configuration with group call
redundancy is shown in figure 11A. Figure 11A does not show details on
GCR restoration (see subclause 5.3.3).

**Service subscriber initiated call**

If the GCR receives an interrogation request for a call initiated by a
service subscriber who is located in the MSC area of the associated MSC,
the GCR calculates the group call reference from the Group ID and the
originating cell ID.

If the group call reference was successfully calculated, the GCR checks
whether a VGCS call with that group call reference is already on-going.

If the call is not marked as on-going, the GCR checks whether an anchor
MSC address is stored in its group call reference record. If this is the
case and initial talker information is not yet stored, a positive
response including the anchor MSC address is returned to the MSC, the
initial talker information (IMSI, talker priority, originating cell id
and additional info) of the initiating service subscriber is stored in
the GCR and the process returns to the idle state. If anchor MSC address
and initial talker information are stored (this is the case where the
associated MSC is relay MSC, and timer T3 is running, i.e. group call
setup is in progress but the call is not yet fully established), a
negative response indicating \"on-going call\" is returned to the MSC
and the process returns to the idle state. If no anchor MSC address is
stored (i.e. the associated MSC is anchor MSC with respect to this group
call reference) the GCR marks its group call reference record with
\"on-going call\" and returns a positive response including the group
call attributes to the MSC and the process returns to the idle state.

If the group call reference could not be successfully calculated from
the Group ID and the originating cell ID, the GCR returns a negative
response indicating \"failure\" to the MSC and the process returns to
the idle state.

If the call was marked as on-going, the GCR returns a negative response
indicating \"on-going call\" to the MSC and the process returns to the
idle state.

**IAM initiated call**

If the GCR receives an interrogation request for a call initiated by a
dispatcher or by a service subscriber who is not located in the MSC area
of the associated MSC, the GCR checks the calling party number of the
initiator against the list of identities of dispatchers which are
allowed to initiate the voice group call and against the VGCS prefix
plus group call reference in order to determine whether the initiator is
allowed to set-up the call. If the check is successful the GCR checks
whether a VGCS call with the same group call reference is already
on-going.

If the call is not marked as on-going, the GCR marks its group call
reference record with \"on-going call\" and returns a positive response
including the group call attributes to the MSC and the process returns
to the idle state. In addition the GCR shall delete stored initial
talker information (if any).

If the calling party number check was not successful, the GCR returns a
negative response indicating \"failure\" to the MSC and the process
returns to the idle state.

If the call was marked as on-going, the GCR returns a negative response
indicating \"on-going call\" to the MSC and the process returns to the
idle state.

**Anchor MSC triggered call**

If the GCR (associated to a relay MSC) receives an interrogation request
for a call triggered by the anchor MSC, the GCR returns a positive
response to the MSC including:\
- the list of cells inside the MSC area of the requesting MSC in which
the call is to be sent\
- the stored initial talker information (if any)\
and\
- marks its group call reference with \"on-going call\",\
-deletes the stored initial talker information (if any)\
and the process returns to the idle state.

**VMSC triggered call (in a RANflex configuration)**

If the GCR (associated to a group call serving MSC) receives an
interrogation request for a call triggered by the VMSC, the GCR

\- calculates the group call reference from the Group ID and the
originating cell ID.

If for the calculated group call reference the record is marked with
\"on-going call\" or initial talker information is already stored, a
negative response indicating \"on-going call\" is returned to the GCSMSC
and the process returns to the idle state. Otherwise the GCR

\- stores the initial talker information (IMSI, talker priority,
originating cell id and additional information received with the
request); and

\- returns a positive response including group call reference and , if
the group call serving MSC is a relay MSC, the anchor MSC address.

**Call release**

If the GCR receives a call released indication from the MSC, the
\"on-going call\" indicator in the group call reference record is reset,
the initial talker information is deleted (if any) and the process
returns to the idle state.

**SM MT delivery**

When receiving an interrogation request from the anchorMSC, the GCR
shall check if the voice group call is established or not and shall send
a response containing the voice group call attributes for short message
transfer to the anchor MSC.

11.7 Functional requirement of VLR
----------------------------------

The Group Call number allocation process in the VLR is shown in figure
12.

**Successful procedure**

When receiving a request from the relay MSC to allocate a Group Call
number, the VLR checks if a Group Call number is available. If so it
selects a Group Call number, marks the number as allocated, returns a
positive response including the Group Call number to the MSC, starts a
supervision timer and waits for removal of the Group Call number. If the
VLR receives a request to release the Group Call number, the VLR marks
the Group Call number as free and the process returns to the idle state.

**No Group Call number available**

If no Group Call number is available, the VLR returns a negative
response indicating \"no Group Call number available\" to the MSC and
the process returns to the idle state.

**Supervision timer expires**

If the supervision timer expires, the VLR indicates to the relay MSC
that the dialogue has to be aborted.

11.8 Functional requirement of SMS Gateway MSC

**SM MT delivery**

When receiving a short message TPDU from the SC, the SMS‑GMSC shall
inspect the parameters and identify the group call reference.

NOTE: The SMS‑GMSC may be identical to the MSC.

If the parameters are incorrect then the SMS-GMSC shall return the
appropriate error information to the SC in a failure report (see
clauses 9 and 10 of 3GPP TS23.040 \[14\]).

If no errors are found within the parameters the SMS-GMSC shall send the
MT\_ForwardSM\_For\_VGCS\_REQ message to transfer the received short
message to the anchor MSC or anchor MSC redundancy pool using the
routing information derived from the group call reference.

If the SMS-GMSC receives the MT\_ForwardSM\_For\_VGCS\_RES message
indicating the voice group call is established and including a list of
identities of dispatchers, it may optionally initiate point-to-point
short message transfer attempts to the dispatchers who are connected to
the voice group call.

If the SMS-GMSC receives the MT\_ForwardSM\_For\_VGCS\_RES message
indicating the voice group call is not established, it shall either

i\) discard the short message and return the appropriate error
information to the SC, or

ii\) initiate point to point short message transfer attempts to the
members of the group.

NOTE: How the routing information of the voice group call subscribers
for the point to point SMS transfer can be derived from the group call
reference is out of scope of this specification and implementation
dependent. This can be achieved e.g. by an internal or external
database.

13 List of system parameters
============================

13.1 Timers
-----------

### 13.1.1 Txx

This is a supervision timer on the anchor MSC for the setup of the voice
group call. It is started on receipt of a SETUP message from the calling
subscriber when the calling subscriber is in the anchor MSC area and on
receipt of an ISUP IAM from the relay MSC when the calling subscriber is
in the relay MSC area. Refer to subclause 11.3.1.1.2 for procedures on
expiry.

The value of timer Txx is operator specific.

### 13.1.2 T1

In a network supporting talker priorities or uplink access option (i) as
defined in subclause 7.2, the uplink busy message on the FACCH of the
voice group call channel downlink is repeated by the BSS every T1
seconds (see subclause 11.3.7.1).

The value of timer T1 is operator specific. Its default value is 5
seconds.

### 13.1.3 T2

In a network supporting the transmission of additional
subscriber-related information, the additional info message on the SACCH
of the voice group call channel downlink is repeated by the BSS every T2
seconds, until the current talker releases the uplink or is released by
the network (see subclause 11.3.7.1).

The value of timer T2 is operator specific. Its default value is 5
seconds.

### 13.1.4 Tbb

In a network supporting validation of Priority Uplink Requests,
the timer Tbb supervises the broadcast of a new token (Y) after a valid
Priority Uplink Request has been received.

If a Priority Uplink Request is received, and the token matches the
token in the BSS (X) then the request is accepted, token X is
invalidated and Tbb is started. On Tbb expiry a new token (Y), and the
priority of the accepted request, is sent in the uplink busy message on
the FACCH of the voice group call channels. The Tbb timer should be set
to a value that allows other service subscribers who sent a Priority
Uplink Request with token X, at the same time as the one accepted by the
network, to be back on the voice group call channel in order to receive
the new token (Y).

The default value for Tbb is 500ms..

### 13.1.5 Ttv

In a network supporting validation of Priority Uplink Requests, the
timer Ttv supervises an additional validity period for an unused token
(A). When T1 (supervising the periodic uplink busy) expires a new token
(B) is sent in the uplink busy message on the FACCH of the voice group
call channels and timer Ttv is started. If a Priority Uplink Request is
received before Ttv expires and the token matches either token in the
BSS (A or B), the request is considered to be valid, both tokens (A and
B) in the BSS are invalidated and Ttv is stopped. If Ttv expires (i.e.
no valid Priority Uplink Request has been received within Ttv seconds)
the unused token (A) is invalidated.

The value of timer Ttv is operator specific. The value chosen should
allow for the reception of requests from service subscribers who have
left the group call channel before receipt of the UPLINK\_BUSY with new
token (B). Its default value is 1s.

### 13.1.6 Tast

In a network supporting A-interface link sharing timer Tast shall be
used to measure the duration between periodic reports from the BSC to
the MSC of Group Call Area cells for which channels have been assigned
or released, pre-empted or failed since the last periodic report. When
timer Tast expires, if new cells in the Group Call Area have been
established or existing ones have been released, pre-empted or failed,
the MSC shall be informed of the changes (see subclause 7.1b). If no
changes have occurred nothing shall be sent. Timer Tast shall be
restarted to measure the period of time until the next report. The timer
shall be stopped when the call is released.

The value of timer Tast is operator specific. Its default value is 5
seconds.

### 13.1.7 T3

In a RANflex configuration the group call serving MSC when receiving
Send Group Call Info from the VMSC shall supervise the setup of the
group call by timer T3. T3 is started when a positive Send Group Call
Info result is returned to the VMSC and it is stopped when the group
call is set up. At timeout the temporarily stored transient data are
deleted from the GCR.

In a RANflex configuration with group call redundancy T3 shall be
implemented in the GCR instead of in the MSC. T3 is started when initial
talker information is stored and stopped when initial talker information
is deleted. At timeout initial talker information is deleted from the
GCR.

The value of timer T3 is operator specific. Its default value is 5
seconds.
