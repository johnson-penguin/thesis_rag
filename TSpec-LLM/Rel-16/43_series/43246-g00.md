4 MBMS GERAN Architecture
=========================

4.1 General
-----------

One new transmission mode exists to provide the MBMS service:

\- Point-to-multipoint transmission (p-t-m)

Point-to-multipoint transmission is used to transfer MBMS specific
information between the network and an unspecified number of mobile
stations. It is used for both broadcast and multicast modes of MBMS.

4.2 GERAN A/Gb mode architecture
--------------------------------

### 4.2.1 Protocol structure

No modifications are required to the GPRS protocol stack (see 3GPP TS
23.060) for MBMS. However, some of the radio protocols in the GERAN will
require modifications to support MBMS p-t-m bearers.

### 4.2.2 void

### 4.2.3 MBMS reception

Table 4.2.3.1 shows whether a mobile station can support MBMS data
reception according to its mode (packet idle mode, packet transfer mode,
dedicated mode or dual transfer mode) at the time of the MBMS bearer
establishment i.e. immediately prior to MBMS reception.

Table 4.2.3.1: MBMS radio bearer available according to initial MAC mode
and MBMS service

1\) A mobile station is moved to dual transfer mode on establishment of
a TBF to request an MBMS p-t-p repair.

2\) Support is optional in the mobile station.

3\) Note that an MBMS broadcast service is only available on a p-t-m
radio bearer.

4.3 GERAN Iu mode architecture
------------------------------

### 4.3.1 Protocol structure 

No modifications are required to the GPRS protocol stack (see 3GPP TS
23.060 \[1\]) for MBMS. However, some of the radio protocols in the
GERAN will require modifications to support MBMS p-t-m bearers.

### 4.3.2 void

### 4.3.3 MBMS reception

Table 4.3.3.1 shows which type of MBMS radio bearer shall be assigned to
the mobile station according to its RRC and MAC states at the time of
the MBMS bearer establishment i.e. immediately prior to MBMS reception.

1\) A mobile station is moved to MAC-Shared state on establishment of an
MBMS p-t-p radio bearer

2\) A mobile station is moved to RRC-Cell\_Shared state on establishment
of an MBMS radio bearer (p-t-m or p-t-p)

3\) A mobile station is moved to MAC-DTM state on establishment of an
MBMS p-t-p radio bearer if it has no other PS connections established

4\) Support is optional in the mobile station

5\) Note that an MBMS broadcast service is only available on a p-t-m
radio bearer

5. MBMS channel structure 
=========================

5.1 Logical channels 
--------------------

For MBMS p-t-m transmission, the traffic data is carried on PDTCH (see
3GPP TS 45.002 \[8\]), whereas the control data is carried on PACCH (see
3GPP TS 45.002 \[8\]).

A new logical channel is defined, the MPRACH, which may be used during
the initial counting procedure (see sub-clause 6.1.1.3). On the MPRACH,
Packet Access Bursts or Extended Packet Access Bursts can be
transmitted.

5.2 Physical channels
---------------------

### 5.2.1 General

MBMS p-t-m radio bearers are transmitted on PDCH (see 3GPP TS 45.002
\[8\]).

On a PDCH it shall be possible to multiplex different MBMS p-t-m radio
bearers and GPRS and/or EGPRS TBFs using TFI.

### 5.2.2 Coding schemes

The existing GPRS and EGPRS coding schemes are used for MBMS.

An MBMS-capable mobile station shall support CS-1 to CS-4 and MCS-1 to
MCS-9 in the downlink. A network supporting MBMS may support only some
of the coding schemes.

### 5.2.3 Mapping of MPRACH onto physical channels

The MPRACH may be mapped on any uplink PDCH.

The MPRACH is dynamically allocated in groups of four MPRACH blocks By
(y=4x+i, i=0 ,.., 3) corresponding to one PDCH block Bx (x=0,\...,11),
indicated by a USF. The value of the USF allocated to the mobile station
is signalled by the network in the notification message.

6 MBMS procedures in GERAN
==========================

6.1 Resource management procedures
----------------------------------

### 6.1.1 Session start

#### 6.1.1.1 General

Upon receiving an MBMS SESSION START REQUEST message (or an MBMS SESSION
UPDATE REQUEST message for an ongoing MBMS broadcast session with an
updated MBMS service area) from the SGSN, if the network controls cells
in the MBMS service area the network creates an MBMS Service Context (if
not yet available for the ongoing MBMS broadcast session), and
acknowledges the SGSN using an MBMS SESSION START RESPONSE message (or
an MBMS SESSION UPDATE RESPONSE message). The network may receive an
Allocation/Retention Priority associated with the MBMS session in the
MBMS SESSION START REQUEST message (or in the MBMS SESSION UPDATE
REQUEST message).

The network may use the Allocation/Retention Priority to prioritise
between MBMS bearer services, and between MBMS bearer services and
non-MBMS bearer services. The network initiates the MBMS channel
establishment in each cell belonging to the MBMS service area where the
network has decided to provide this MBMS service (and where the MBMS
channel has not yet been established in case of an ongoing MBMS
broadcast session).

The channel establishment procedure consists of the following steps:

\- the optional pre-notification of the MBMS service which is starting a
data transmission;

\- the notification of all MBMS users in the cell of this MBMS service;

\- an optional counting procedure; and

\- a channel assignment message. The type of channel assigned may depend
on the number of users in the cell who respond to the notification in
the counting procedure.

If counting is not required, the notification and channel assignment
information may be transmitted in a single (PACKET) PAGING REQUEST
message in the case of an MBMS broadcast service or an MBMS multicast
service.

#### 6.1.1.1a Pre-notification

The network may indicate the incoming notification of a given MBMS
service and MBMS session by sending a pre-notification of this MBMS
service and MBMS session to MBMS mobile stations in packet idle mode.

A pre-notification may be sent in PAGING REQUEST TYPE 1 or 2 messages on
CCCH, or if PCCCH is present, in PACKET PAGING REQUEST message and
identifies the TMGI as well as, if available, the MBMS Session Identity.
Upon reception of a pre-notification for an MBMS service and MBMS
session, a mobile station in packet idle mode shall enter non-DRX mode
and monitor notifications as described in sub-clause 6.1.1.2 in the
following cases:

\- the MBMS service is a broadcast service and the mobile station is
required to receive this service; or

\- the MBMS service is a multicast service and the mobile station has
joined this service.

#### 6.1.1.2 Notification of session start

##### 6.1.1.2.1 General

When the network is informed that an MBMS session is starting or an
ongoing MBMS broadcast session has an updated MBMS service area, the
network notifies mobile stations in packet idle mode or MAC-Idle state,
and may notify mobile stations in packet transfer mode or MAC-Shared
state, or mobile stations in dedicated mode or MAC-Dedicated state, or
mobile stations in dual transfer mode or MAC-DTM state. The mobile
stations in packet idle mode or MAC-Idle state are notified on the
(P)PCH by the network. The mobile stations in packet transfer mode or
MAC-Shared state and the mobile stations in dual transfer mode or
MAC-DTM state may be notified on the PACCH by the network using a
distribution message. The mobile stations in dedicated mode or
MAC-Dedicated state may be notified on the main DCCH by the network.

The network may optionally initiate, on a per-cell basis, a counting
mechanism (i.e. to count up to an operator-defined user threshold \> 0)
to ascertain the interest of users in each cell. This may be used in
order to select the type of MBMS radio bearer (i.e. characterized by an
uplink feedback channel or not) to establish. If counting is activated
in a cell, mobile stations shall respond to the notification using the
initial counting procedure, see sub-clause 6.1.1.3.

If counting is not activated, the network may allocate the MBMS bearer
in a cell using the MBMS bearer establishment procedure, see sub-clause
6.1.1.4.

##### 6.1.1.2.2 Mobile stations in packet idle mode or MAC-Idle state

If the network controls cells in the MBMS service area of a starting
MBMS session (or of an ongoing MBMS broadcast session with an updated
MBMS service area), the network initiates the MBMS notification
procedure on each of these cells. A notification is sent in PAGING
REQUEST TYPE 1 or 2 messages on CCCH, or if PCCCH is present, in PACKET
PAGING REQUEST message and identifies the TMGI as well as, if available,
the MBMS Session Identity.

A notification may include the uplink resource description for a PRACH
dedicated to MBMS (MPRACH). If a PRACH is allocated in the cell, and no
MPRACH Control Parameters are included in the notification message, the
PRACH Control Parameters shall be used for the MPRACH. If the network
wishes to allocate an MPRACH and no PRACH is allocated in the cell, the
MBMS Notification message shall include the MPRACH Control Parameters.
If present, MPRACH Control Parameters take precedence over PRACH Control
Parameters.

If a mobile station has not joined the MBMS multicast service identified
by the TMGI or has already received the MBMS session identified by the
TMGI and MBMS Session Identity combination contained in the (PACKET)
PAGING REQUEST message, the mobile station shall discard the message.

If the mobile station has not previously received the MBMS session
identified by the TMGI and MBMS Session Identity (if available)
combination contained in the (PACKET) PAGING REQUEST message and the
message includes an indication that \"counting shall be used\", then the
mobile station shall initiate the initial counting procedure, see
sub-clause 6.1.1.3, otherwise if such an indication is not included then
the mobile station shall continue with the MBMS bearer establishment
procedure, see sub-clause 6.1.1.4.

##### 6.1.1.2.3 Mobile stations in packet transfer mode or MAC-Shared state and mobile stations in dual transfer mode or MAC-DTM state

If the network controls cells in the MBMS service area of a starting
MBMS session (or of an ongoing MBMS broadcast session with an updated
MBMS service area), the network may pass a PACKET MBMS ANNOUNCEMENT
message to all MBMS capable mobile stations that have a PACCH. The
PACKET MBMS ANNOUNCEMENT message includes the TMGI and, if available,
the MBMS Session Identity of an MBMS session and may optionally include
a parameter that dictates whether there is maximum reaction time for the
mobile station or the MBMS session (remaining) duration, the uplink
resource description for a PRACH dedicated to MBMS (MPRACH) possibly
with control parameters, or the channel assignment information for the
MBMS session.

If the mobile station has not previously joined the MBMS multicast
service identified by the TMGI or the mobile station has already
received the MBMS session identified by the TMGI and the MBMS Session
Identity combination contained in the PACKET MBMS ANNOUNCEMENT message,
the mobile station discards the message. If the mobile station has
joined the MBMS multicast service identified by the TMGI contained in
the PACKET MBMS ANNOUNCEMENT message and has not received the session,
optionally identified by the MBMS Session Identity, then the mobile
station stores the MBMS information contained in the PACKET MBMS
ANNOUNCEMENT message, initialises timer T3222 (see 3GPP TS 44.060) if
indicated to do so and the session duration timer for this MBMS session
if the MBMS session (remaining) duration is included in the PACKET MBMS
ANNOUNCEMENT message, and passes the received TMGI, and the MBMS Session
Identity if available, to the upper layers. If timer T3222 expires the
stored MBMS information associated with the timer is deleted.

If the mobile station returns to packet idle mode or MAC-Idle state when
MBMS information is stored, then:

\- if the channel assignment information for the MBMS session was not
included in the PACKET MBMS ANNOUNCEMENT message, the mobile station
initiates the initial counting procedure using the stored MBMS
information, (see sub-clause 6.1.1.3), once the Transfer non-DRX mode
period has elapsed;

\- if the channel assignment information for the MBMS session was
included in the PACKET MBMS ANNOUNCEMENT message, the mobile station
starts listening to the MBMS p-t-m radio bearer.

##### 6.1.1.2.4 Mobile stations in dedicated mode or MAC-Dedicated state

If the network controls cells in the MBMS service area of a starting
MBMS session (or of an ongoing MBMS broadcast session with an updated
MBMS service area), the network may pass an MBMS ANNOUNCEMENT message to
all mobile stations that have previously requested to be notified on the
main DCCH. The MBMS ANNOUNCEMENT message includes the TMGI and, if
available, the MBMS Session Identity of an MBMS session and may
optionally include a parameter that dictates whether there is maximum
reaction time for the mobile station or the MBMS session (remaining)
duration, the uplink resource description for a PRACH dedicated to MBMS
(MPRACH) possibly with control parameters, or the channel assignment
information for the MBMS session.

If the mobile station has not previously joined the MBMS multicast
service identified by the TMGI or the mobile station has already
received the MBMS session identified by the TMGI and the MBMS Session
Identity combination contained in the MBMS ANNOUNCEMENT message, the
mobile station discards the message. If the mobile station has joined
the MBMS Service identified by the TMGI and has not received the
session, optionally identified by the MBMS Session Identity, then the
mobile station stores the MBMS information contained in the MBMS
ANNOUNCEMENT message, initialises timer T3222 (see 3GPP TS 44.060) if
indicated to do so and the session duration timer for this MBMS session
if the MBMS session (remaining) duration is included in the MBMS
ANNOUNCEMENT message, and passes the received TMGI, and the MBMS Session
Identity if available, to the upper layers. If timer T3222 expires the
stored MBMS information associated with the timer is deleted.

If the mobile station returns to packet idle mode or MAC-Idle state when
MBMS information is stored, then:

\- if the channel assignment information for the MBMS session was not
included in the MBMS ANNOUNCEMENT message, the mobile station initiates
the initial counting procedure using the stored MBMS information, see
sub-clause 6.1.1.3;

\- if the channel assignment information for the MBMS session was
included in the MBMS ANNOUNCEMENT message, the mobile station starts
listening to the MBMS p-t-m radio bearer.

#### 6.1.1.3 Initial counting procedure

The mechanism in the requirements 11 and 12 in A.1.1 implies that an
MBMS channel should not be established if no interested users are in the
cell at the time of the notification of the MBMS session. The network
using such a mechanism would therefore wait for at least one response
from an MBMS user in each cell before assigning the MBMS bearer. The
initial counting procedure can also be used to count the number of
mobile stations when starting a broadcast session.

If the notification message or the (PACKET) MBMS ANNOUNCEMENT message
contains the uplink resource description for an MPRACH, packet access
for counting is initiated by the mobile station by sending on such
MPRACH a PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST message with access cause \"Single Block
MBMS Access\" requesting a single uplink block. The mobile station acts
on any response sent by the network to that mobile station.

If the notification message or the (PACKET) MBMS ANNOUNCEMENT message
does not contain any uplink resource description for an MPRACH, packet
access for counting is initiated by the mobile station by sending a
(PACKET) CHANNEL REQUEST message on the common (P)RACH, with access
cause \"Single Block MBMS Access\" requesting a single uplink block.

Upon reception by the network of a (PACKET) CHANNEL REQUEST message with
access cause \"Single Block MBMS Access\", the network sends an
IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT message on CCCH (or a PACKET UPLINK ASSIGNMENT
message on PAGCH) allocating one uplink block to the mobile station.

Upon reception by the mobile station of an IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT
(respectively PACKET UPLINK ASSIGNMENT) message corresponding to one of
its (PACKET) CHANNEL REQUEST messages and allocating one uplink radio
block for MBMS access, the mobile station sends in this radio block an
MBMS SERVICE REQUEST message on PACCH to the network including its TLLI,
the TMGI and, if available, the MBMS Session Identity of the session,
and enters non-DRX mode. In case the MBMS SERVICE REQUEST message is not
correctly received on the network side, the network may repeat the
IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT message on CCCH (or PACKET UPLINK ASSIGNMENT
message on PAGCH), allowing the mobile station to re-send the MBMS
SERVICE REQUEST message. The reception by the network of the MBMS
SERVICE REQUEST message from a number of mobile stations allows the
network to estimate in a given cell the number of mobile stations
interested in a given session.

FIGURE 6.1.1.3.a: No counting and no PTM Bearer defined

FIGURE 6.1.1.3.b: Counting used

FIGURE 6.1.1.3.c: PTM Bearer established

This estimate may be used by the network to establish a
point-to-multipoint channel for a given session, possibly characterized
by an uplink feedback channel, or to notify the mobile stations that no
point-to-multipoint channel will be established.

In case an uplink feedback channel is established, to receive MBMS
DOWNLINK ACK/NACK messages from the mobile stations addressing of mobile
stations is required. This procedure is described in sub-clause 6.1.1.5.
The network may address (i.e. distribute MS\_ID identifiers to) only a
subset of the counted mobile stations. In this case, mobile stations
without an allocated MS\_ID shall only listen to the MBMS p-t-m radio
bearer and will not send any feedback.

#### 6.1.1.4 MBMS bearer establishment

The network may allocate the MBMS bearer by including the bearer
description and the MBMS session duration in the notification message.
An MBMS bearer allocated via the notification message will initially
operate without ARQ at the RLC/MAC layer (see sub-clause 6.3.1.1).

The network may send the MBMS ASSIGNMENT message as a distribution
message on PAGCH or, if PCCCH is not present in the cell, the IMMEDIATE
ASSIGNMENT message including the *Multiple Blocks Packet Downlink
Assignment* construction on AGCH followed by the MBMS ASSIGNMENT message
sent on the PDCH specified by the *Packet Channel Description* IE in the
IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT message (see 3GPP TS 44.060 and 3GPP TS 44.018) to
all interested mobile stations in packet idle mode.

The network either assigns a point-to-multipoint bearer for the
transmission of the MBMS session in a cell, or notifies the mobile
stations that a p-t-m bearer will not be established in the cell. The
decision of whether to allocate resources in a cell is implementation
dependent.

The MBMS ASSIGNMENT message may be sent as a non-distribution message to
a specific mobile station that performs an access.

The MBMS ASSIGNMENT message includes the TMGI, the Session Id when
available, the MBMS session duration, the MBMS\_BEARER\_ID, the MBMS
In-band Signalling Indicator (see sub-clause 6.6) and the p-t-m channel
description to assign the p-t-m bearer in the cell, or, if the p-t-m
bearer is not assigned in the cell, a cause value indicating one of the
following reasons:

1\) Further MBMS access allowed for the current MBMS session in the
current cell; or

2\) No further MBMS access allowed for the current MBMS session in the
current cell (e.g. the cell is outside the MBMS Service Area for the
requested MBMS service); or

3\) No further MBMS access allowed for the current MBMS session in the
Routeing Area (e.g. the network does not have any information about the
requested session); or

4\) No further MBMS access allowed for the current MBMS session in any
cell of the PLMN.

> If the mobile station detects:

\- Cause 1. above, the mobile station may perform additional access
attempts for the current MBMS session in this cell. If the mobile
station moves cell whilst the session duration timer in the mobile
station is running, the mobile station may request the session in any
cell that supports MBMS.

\- Cause 2. above, the mobile station shall not perform any further
access attempts for the current MBMS session whilst the mobile station
remains in this cell. If the mobile station moves cell whilst the
session duration timer in the mobile station is running, the mobile
station may request the session in any other cell that supports MBMS.

\- Cause 3. above, the mobile station shall not perform any further
access attempts for the current MBMS session in the current Routeing
Area. If the mobile station moves Routeing Area whilst the session
duration timer in the mobile station is running, the mobile station may
request the session in any other cell that supports MBMS.

\- Cause 4. above, the mobile station shall not perform any further
access attempts for the current MBMS session.

When the session duration timer in the mobile station expires the mobile
station shall no longer attempt to request this MBMS session in any cell
and indicates to the upper layers that the multicast/broadcast delivery
of this MBMS session is complete.

Note that a mobile station is allowed to perform a new access attempt if
it has received a new (repeated) notification, irrespective of a
reception of a previous reject cause (i.e. cause 1 to 4 defined above)
and of the expiry of the session duration timer for the MBMS session in
the mobile station.

NOTE: The session duration timer in the mobile station is initialised
with a value equal to the estimated session duration which may be
included in the notification or in the (PACKET) MBMS ANNOUNCEMENT
message or in the MBMS ASSIGNMENT message.

The MBMS ASSIGNMENT message may be repeated by the network, in order to
overcome potential radio impairments on the PDCH on which it is
transmitted.

The network may send the MBMS ASSIGNMENT message at any time during the
counting procedure and before a maximum time limit after notification
elapses (see Annex A.1.1).

Upon reception of an MBMS ASSIGNMENT message including the
MBMS\_BEARER\_ID and the p-t-m channel description for a given session,
a mobile station that requires the reception of this session, does not
perform any further access attempts (see sub-clause 6.1.1.3) and
switches to the assigned p-t-m channel.

Upon reception of an MBMS ASSIGNMENT message not including the
MBMS\_BEARER\_ID and the p-t-m channel description for a given session,
all interested mobile stations in packet idle mode perform as specified
above depending on the cause indication why no p-t-m bearer was
established.

#### 6.1.1.5 Address assignment procedure

The assignment of an MS\_ID address to a counted mobile station is
performed by the network sending an MBMS MS\_ID ASSIGNMENT message on
the PACCH/D of the point-to-multipoint radio bearer addressed via the
MBMS\_BEARER\_ID. If an MBMS ASSIGNMENT message is sent as a
non-distribution message it can contain MS\_ID and then no MBMS MS\_ID
ASSIGNMENT message needs to be sent. On a given point-to-multipoint
bearer there is a one-to-one relationship between an MBMS\_BEARER\_ID +
MS\_ID combination and the TLLI of the mobile station. The MBMS MS\_ID
ASSIGNMENT message also includes the timing advance parameters for the
addressed mobile station.

The network may request an addressed mobile station to acknowledge, with
a PACKET CONTROL ACKNOWLEDGEMENT message, the reception of the MBMS
MS\_ID ASSIGNMENT message.

The mobile stations are identified with an MBMS\_BEARER\_ID + MS\_ID
combination, which is provided within the TFI field. Both the
MBMS\_BEARER\_ID and the MS\_ID are variable length fields inside the
TFI field. The MBMS\_BEARER\_ID may range from a 1-bit field up to a
5-bit field (in the latter case no mobile station may be addressed). The
MS\_ID may range from a 1-bit field up to a 4-bit field. At any time the
overall size of the MBMS\_BEARER\_ID + MS\_ID combination is a 5-bit
field, i.e. the size of the TFI field. On a PDCH an MBMS bearer is
identified by the MBMS\_BEARER\_ID contained in the most significant
bit(s) part of the TFI field; all TFI values whose most significant bits
are equal to a given MBMS\_BEARER\_ID are reserved for this MBMS bearer
and shall not be used for any other (E)GPRS TBFs or p-t-m radio bearer
on that PDCH. All the mobile stations receiving the MBMS p-t-m radio
bearer identified by a given MBMS\_BEARER\_ID shall try to decode all
the RLC/MAC blocks where the TFI field contains this MBMS\_BEARER\_ID.

The network may modify the lengths of the MBMS\_BEARER\_ID and the
MS\_ID fields during an ongoing MBMS session in order to dynamically
change the multiplexing of different MBMS p-t-m radio bearers and/or
(E)GPRS TBFs on the same PDCH(s). The network performs such identity
reassignment of an MBMS radio bearer by sending an MBMS ASSIGNMENT
message as a non-distribution message on the PACCH/D, containing the old
and the new MBMS\_BEARER\_ID and optionally the starting time of the
validity of the new MBMS\_BEARER\_ID.

The network may reallocate or delete the MS\_ID value assigned to a
specific MS with an MBMS MS\_ID ASSIGNMENT message.

#### 6.1.1.6 Repetition of notifications of an on-going MBMS session

The network may repeat notifications of an ongoing session (repeated
notifications). The same procedures as in sub-clause 6.1.1.2 shall be
used with the exception that the network shall provide the estimated
remaining duration of the MBMS session.

A mobile station that is receiving an MBMS session shall ignore repeated
(pre-)notifications of that session.

### 6.1.2 MBMS channel reconfiguration 

The network may modify the channel allocation for an MBMS bearer by
sending an MBMS ASSIGNMENT message as a non-distribution message
including the relevant MBMS\_BEARER\_ID. The MS shall use the same
MS\_ID on the new resource.

The MBMS ASSIGNMENT message includes the new MBMS bearer description,
the session duration value indicating the remaining duration of the MBMS
session and the MBMS In-band Signalling Indicator (see sub-clause 6.6).

### 6.1.3 MBMS channel release

When the GERAN receives an MBMS SESSION STOP REQUEST message from the
SGSN indicating that the MBMS session can be released, the network
acknowledges this request by sending the MBMS SESSION STOP RESPONSE
message to the SGSN. The network removes all radio resources allocated
for the MBMS session, identified in the MBMS SESSION STOP REQUEST
message.

During the MBMS session the network may decide that the bearer
supporting the MBMS session is to be released. If the network decides to
prematurely release the bearer, the network sends a PACKET TBF RELEASE
message.

At the end of an MBMS session, indicated by the expiry of the Session
Duration Timer, a mobile station shall notify the upper layers.

When the GERAN receives an MBMS SESSION UPDATE REQUEST message from the
SGSN the network releases the MBMS channel in each cell no longer
belonging to the MBMS service area in case of an ongoing MBMS broadcast
session with an updated MBMS service area. The network acknowledges this
request by sending the MBMS SESSION UPDATE RESPONSE message to the SGSN
(see sub-clause 6.1.1.1).

6.2 Mobility procedures
-----------------------

### 6.2.1 Distribution of MBMS neighbouring cell information

If in a given cell an MBMS session is being sent on a p-t-m channel; and
if in any neighbouring cell of that given cell, the same session is
being sent on a p-t-m channel, the network may provide in that given
cell for that MBMS session, information about the characteristics
(frequency and timeslot allocation) of the MBMS p-t-m channel and the
relevant MBMS\_BEARER\_ID of each of these neighbouring cells. The
network shall not provide neighbouring cell information for sessions
that are not being sent in that given cell.

This information is provided to mobile stations on the PACCH/D of the
p-t-m channel using the MBMS NEIGHBOURING CELL INFORMATION message. This
message also includes an indication of whether an uplink feedback
channel associated to the MBMS p-t-m channel is established in the
specific cell, and if so on which timeslot and whether an MPRACH is
allocated onto that timeslot or not, and the MBMS In-band Signalling
Indicator (see sub-clause 6.6).

In order to increase the likelihood that all mobile stations prior to
reselecting a cell, have received, if available, the MBMS NEIGHBOURING
CELL INFORMATION message(s) for that cell:

\- If feedback is in use, a mobile station when polled shall indicate in
the MBMS DOWNLINK ACK/NACK message as many as possible of and up to the
6 strongest non-serving carriers to the network. The network may in turn
prioritise the transmission of MBMS NEIGHBOURING CELL INFORMATION
messages according to the neighbouring cells reported by the mobile
stations.

In addition, if so ordered by the network in GPRS Cell Options IE, a
mobile station monitoring an MBMS session on a p-t-m channel shall not
reselect a suitable neighbouring cell until it has received, if
available, an MBMS NEIGHBOURING CELL INFORMATION message for that cell
and that session. If within a given time after having determined a
suitable neighbouring cell, the mobile station still has not received
any MBMS NEIGHBOURING CELL INFORMATION message for that neighbouring
cell and that session, the mobile station shall proceed with cell
reselection.

NOTE: The order in which the MBMS NEIGHBOURING CELL INFORMATION messages
are sent is implementation dependent.

### 6.2.2 MBMS reception resumption after cell reselection

#### 6.2.2.1 Default behaviour

If a mobile station receiving an MBMS session on a p-t-m channel
reselects a new cell for which it does not have any information about an
MBMS bearer being allocated in the cell for that MBMS session, the
mobile station, after having acquired a consistent set of (packet)
system information, shall request the MBMS service from the network
using the following procedure, if MBMS is supported in the cell.

![](media/image6.wmf){width="2.4138888888888888in"
height="1.6583333333333334in"}

1\. / 2. The mobile station requests resources using a (PACKET) CHANNEL
REQUEST message denoting \"Single Block MBMS Access\" and is allocated
resources from the network.

3\. The mobile station sends an MBMS SERVICE REQUEST message including
its TLLI, the TMGI and the session ID of the requested MBMS service. In
case the MBMS SERVICE REQUEST message is not correctly received on the
network side, the network may repeat the IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT message on
AGCH (or PACKET UPLINK ASSIGNMENT message on PAGCH), allowing the mobile
station to re-send the MBMS SERVICE REQUEST message.

4\. Upon receiving the MBMS SERVICE REQUEST message the network can
either:

\- Instruct the mobile station to move to an MBMS point-to-multipoint
bearer (MBMS ASSIGNMENT message including the MBMS\_BEARER\_ID and the
p-t-m channel description); or

\- Notify the mobile station that no p-t-m bearer will be available
(MBMS ASSIGNMENT message not including the MBMS\_BEARER\_ID and the
p-t-m channel description) and report the cause indication why no p-t-m
bearer was established (see sub-clause 6.1.1.4).

In case an uplink feedback channel is established, if there are further
MS\_ID identifiers available, after sending the MBMS ASSIGNMENT message,
the network may decide to send an MBMS MS\_ID ASSIGNMENT message on
PACCH to perform the addressing procedure (see sub-clause 6.1.1.5).

NOTE. The network may send a single assignment message including not
only the TMGI, the Session Id, the MBMS\_BEARER\_ID, the MBMS In-band
Signalling Indicator, the MBMS session duration and the p-t-m channel
description, but also the TLLI, the MS\_ID and the timing advance
parameters in the MBMS ASSIGNMENT message.

In case an uplink feedback channel is established, but there are no more
MS\_ID identifiers available, the network may:

\- Release the uplink feedback channel, adopting a retransmission
strategy that does not exploit user feedback; or

\- Retain the uplink feedback channel and decide not to address the new
mobile station. In this case, the mobile station shall only listen to
the MBMS p-t-m radio bearer and will not send any feedback.

#### 6.2.2.2 Fast reception resumption

If a mobile station receiving an MBMS session on a p-t-m channel
reselects a new cell for which it has received information about an MBMS
bearer being allocated for that session (as described in sub-clause
6.2.1), the mobile station shall immediately switch to this MBMS bearer
and continue receiving that MBMS session without waiting to receive a
consistent set of (packet) system information messages on (P)BCCH in
that cell. If the mobile station also has information about an uplink
feedback channel being established in the cell, the mobile station shall
initiate the address assignment procedure as described below, otherwise
the mobile shall not perform any access to the network. If the mobile
station is in DRX mode (e.g. it is not involved in a *routeing area
update* procedure) and has received the indication that an MPRACH is
allocated on the uplink feedback channel, it shall initiate the
procedure on that MPRACH, otherwise the procedure is initiated by the
mobile station either on a PCCCH or, if a packet control channel is not
allocated in the cell, on a CCCH.

1\. / 2. The mobile station requests resources using a MPRACH PACKET
CHANNEL REQUEST or (PACKET) CHANNEL REQUEST message denoting \"Single
Block MBMS Access\" and is allocated resources from the network.

3\. The mobile station sends an MBMS SERVICE REQUEST message including
its TLLI, the TMGI and the session ID of the requested MBMS service.

4\. Upon receiving the MBMS SERVICE REQUEST message, if there are still
MS\_ID identifiers available, the network may send:

\- an MBMS ASSIGNMENT message on the PAGCH, or on the PCCCH
corresponding to the mobile station PCCCH­\_GROUP if the mobile station
initiated the procedure on the MPRACH; or

\- if PCCCH is not present in the cell, an IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT message
including the *Multiple Blocks Packet Downlink Assignment* construction
on the AGCH, or on the CCCH corresponding to the mobile station
CCCH­\_GROUP if the mobile station initiated the procedure on the
MPRACH, followed by the MBMS ASSIGNMENT message sent on the PDCH
specified by the *Packet Channel Description* IE in the IMMEDIATE
ASSIGNMENT message (see 3GPP TS 44.060 and 3GPP TS 44.018).

> The MBMS ASSIGNMENT message includes not only the TMGI, the Session
> Id, the MBMS\_BEARER\_ID, the MBMS In-band Signalling Indicator, the
> MBMS session duration and the p-t-m channel description, but also the
> TLLI, the MS\_ID and the timing advance parameters. If there are no
> more MS\_ID identifiers available, the network shall answer with an
> MBMS ASSIGNMENT message containing no valid MS\_ID, to inform the
> mobile station to stop the address assignment procedure.

After receiving the MS\_ID, the mobile station shall -- upon polling -
send an MBMS DOWNLINK ACK/NACK message on the uplink feedback channel.

NOTE: The decision regarding which cell the mobile station should
reselect to is performed using the existing procedures (see 3GPP TS
45.008 \[9\]).

### 6.2.3 Cell change

The cell change procedures for mobile stations in broadcast/multicast
receive mode are described in 3GPP TS 43.022 \[10\].

6.3 MBMS data transfer for p-t-m transmission
---------------------------------------------

### 6.3.1 General

#### 6.3.1.1 Point-to-multipoint data transfer options

For *A/Gb mode*, MBMS data, in the form of LLC frames, is mapped into
the RLC/MAC-PTM\_DATA primitive and is distributed from the SGSN to each
network within the MBMS Service Area.

For the p-t-m transmission of MBMS data, the following alternatives are
available:

1\) Without the support of an uplink feedback channel, i.e. without ARQ
at the RLC/MAC layer. Each RLC/MAC block may be retransmitted an
unspecified number of times according to the principles outlined in
sub-clause 6.3.1.2 below and in 3GPP TS 44.060.

2\) With the support of an uplink feedback channel, i.e. with ARQ at the
RLC/MAC layer. A selective retransmission technique may be used; this
does not preclude the possibility to also retransmit blocks
independently on user feedback, as described in bullet 1 above.

For *A/Gb mode*, the LLC layer always operates in unacknowledged mode.

#### 6.3.1.2 RLC protocol behaviour

During an MBMS data transfer, the RLC protocol shall operate in
non-persistent mode (see 3GPP TS 44.060), regardless of the presence of
a feedback channel.

The RLC endpoints in the network and in the mobile stations shall not
expect that every RLC block is correctly received at the mobile station
side.

The mobile station shall consider as valid RLC blocks all the RLC blocks
higher than the next expected highest numbered RLC block as well as
those starting from the next expected highest numbered RLC block and
going backwards a number of blocks equal to the default window size in
the GPRS case or to the window size signalled by the network in the MBMS
ASSIGNMENT message in the EGPRS case. If an NPM Transfer Time limitation
is associated with the MBMS bearer, the mobile station shall consider as
valid RLC blocks all the RLC blocks meeting the conditions above for
which the corresponding timer has not expired. The network should avoid
(re)transmitting RLC blocks that will not be considered as valid by the
mobile stations, to avoid wasting radio resources (see 3GPP TS 44.060).

The RLC protocol behaviour in the mobile station is independent of the
availability of an MS\_ID identifier in the mobile station and is
independent of the transmission strategy used by the network.

### 6.3.2 Block retransmission based on mobile station feedback

During the MBMS session, the MS\_ID is used by the network in order to
address a mobile station, and by the mobile station in order to allow
the network to identify that mobile station among all the mobile
stations involved in that MBMS session. Each mobile station addressed
with an MS\_ID may at any time be requested to send an MBMS DOWNLINK
ACK/NACK message.

![](media/image2.wmf){width="5.166666666666667in" height="3.125in"}

The global identifier (MBMS\_BEARER\_ID + MS\_ID) allows the network to
address a specific mobile station on an MBMS p-t-m bearer.

1\) The mobile station addressed via the global identifier
(MBMS\_BEARER\_ID + MS\_ID) shall send an MBMS DOWNLINK ACK/NACK message
in the uplink radio block period specified by the RRBP value. The mobile
station includes the (MBMS\_BEARER\_ID + MS\_ID) in the MBMS DOWNLINK
ACK/NACK message in order to let the network detect the correct identity
of the responding mobile station.

2\) The network processes the received MBMS DOWNLINK ACK/NACK messages
and may perform retransmissions accordingly.

The mobile station shall notify, whenever possible, the network of the
release of the MS\_ID for that MBMS radio bearer, on the mobile station
side, for whatever reason, in the MBMS DOWNLINK ACK/NACK message. In
turn and consequently, the network may send an MBMS MS\_ID ASSIGNMENT
message to the mobile station, deleting the MS\_ID previously assigned
to that mobile station on that MBMS radio bearer. Any procedure
triggering the release of the MS\_ID on the mobile station side shall
not be delayed by such release indication (otherwise such release
indication shall not be sent).

6.4 Multiple sessions
---------------------

### 6.4.1 Transmission of multiple sessions

When transmitting multiple sessions on the same carrier, the network has
the following options:

1\) the sessions can be multiplexed on the same timeslot or group of
timeslots;

2\) the sessions can be transmitted on separate timeslots or groups of
timeslots;

3\) some sessions can be transmitted with partial overlap on a subset of
all the timeslots on which the sessions are located;

4\) a combination of the above.

When data transfer is with ARQ, separate groups of timeslots in the
downlink shall be associated with different timeslots in the uplink for
the transmission of MBMS DOWNLINK ACK/NACK messages.

If sessions, for which system information and paging messages are sent
on the PACCH (see sub-clause 6.6), are transmitted with partial overlap,
the network may send the system information on one of the timeslots
common to the overlapping sessions in order to reduce the signalling
load.

### 6.4.2 Reception of multiple sessions

The reception of multiple sessions in parallel shall be dependent upon
mobile station capabilities.

NOTE: Depending on the timeslot allocation for the sessions, a mobile
station may not be capable of transmitting MBMS DOWNLINK ACK/NACK
messages on more than one uplink feedback channel.

In the following the priority is an Individual Priority which is mobile
station-specific and user-defined. The Individual Priority allows for
prioritisation between MBMS bearer services on a per-mobile station
basis.

\- If there is a clash of MBMS notification messages, then the mobile
station acts on the MBMS Notification with the highest associated
priority. If the highest associated priority is the same for two or more
MBMS Notifications, then the mobile station shall perform an
implementation dependent selection of the MBMS sessions. The mobile
station shall not respond to other, lower (or equal) priority MBMS
Notifications but may still receive the corresponding sessions, if the
capabilities of the mobile station allow.

> 1\) Reception of notification of lower (or equal) priority MBMS
> session whilst receiving higher priority MBMS session(s):
>
> If the MBMS bearer configuration is contained in the Notification and
> the capabilities of the mobile station allow, the mobile station may
> receive the new session in parallel, otherwise, if the Notification
> does not contain the MBMS bearer configuration and requires the
> counting procedure, the mobile station shall not perform the counting
> procedure but may still receive the MBMS ASSIGNMENT message to check
> if the new MBMS bearer configuration is consistent with its
> capabilities. If so, the mobile station may receive the new session in
> parallel.
>
> 2\. Reception of notification of higher priority MBMS session whilst
> receiving lower priority MBMS session(s):
>
> If the MBMS bearer configuration is contained in the Notification and
> the capabilities of the mobile station allow, the mobile station may

Note: the application layer of the mobile station may decide to
terminate the reception of any MBMS bearer, e.g. the application layer
may terminate the MBMS bearer if a p-t-p repair is initiated and the
MBMS bearer is outside the radio access capabilities (e.g. multislot
capability) of the mobile station.

> 4\. MBMS channel reconfiguration:
>
> If a mobile station is receiving multiple MBMS bearers and any of
> these are reconfigured by the network in a way that does not fall
> within the radio access capabilities (e.g. multislot capability) of
> the mobile station, then the mobile station shall continue receiving
> (one of) the highest priority MBMS session(s) and any other MBMS
> sessions that fall within the mobile station capabilities.

General Note: If the uplink feedback channels are not allocated within
the multislot capabilities of the mobile station, then the mobile
station shall select (one of) the highest priority MBMS session(s) with
a feedback channel and any other MBMS sessions with feedback channels
that then fall within the multislot capabilities.

6.5 Suspension/Resumption of the reception of an MBMS session
-------------------------------------------------------------

In case where a suspension occurs, a mobile station supporting multiple
TBFs may retain the radio layer information for the suspended MBMS
session until the expiry of the timeout timer that controls the normal
operation during MBMS data transfer. The radio layer information is
anyway deleted if the mobile station performs a cell reselection or the
session duration timer for the suspended MBMS session expires.

When the mobile station returns to packet idle mode (or completes the
reception of higher priority MBMS session(s) preventing the mobile
station from receiving the suspended MBMS session), if the radio layer
information is still available, then the mobile station attempts to
resume the reception of the suspended MBMS session, otherwise the mobile
station shall perform an MBMS access, according to sub-clause 6.2.2.1.

6.6 Acquisition of system information and paging messages
---------------------------------------------------------

### 6.6.1 General

During the MBMS session, the mobile station needs to read system
information for the serving cell and be able to receive CS and/or PS
paging messages. The acquisition of system information (see sub-clause
6.6.2) and paging messages (see sub-clause 6.6.3) shall be done on
(P)BCCH and (P)CCCH or on the PACCH as indicated by the MBMS In-band
Signalling Indicator IE included in the MBMS ASSIGNMENT and MBMS
NEIGHBOURING CELL INFORMATION messages.

### 6.6.2 Acquisition of system information

The mobile station reads system information for the serving cell from
the (P)BCCH in parallel to the reception of the MBMS radio bearer,
unless the network has indicated, by setting the MBMS In-band Signalling
Indicator, that system information are sent on the PACCH of the MBMS
radio bearer.

### 6.6.3 Reception of paging messages

The mobile station reads paging messages from the (P)CCCH in parallel to
the reception of the MBMS radio bearer, unless the network has
indicated, by setting the MBMS In-band Signalling Indicator, that paging
messages are sent on the PACCH of the MBMS radio bearer, and the mobile
station has received an MS\_ID. If a mobile station has not (yet)
received an MS\_ID on the MBMS radio bearer, and the location of the
MBMS radio bearer with respect to the control channels does not allow
the mobile station to read the (P)CCCH, the mobile station shall skip
the reception of those radio blocks of the MBMS radio bearer that would
prevent the monitoring of its paging group on the paging channel(s).

NOTE: If the mobile station is in non-DRX mode period (e.g. during a
*routeing area update* procedure) it shall read all the paging
occurrences on the (P)CCCH.

The network does not need to send paging messages on the PACCH to a
mobile station whose MS\_ID has been released due to that the mobile
station has not responded when being polled (i.e. T3195 has started for
that MS\_ID).

If the network sets the MBMS In-band Signalling Indicator, MBMS
notifications are also sent on the PACCH.

7 Mobile Station requirements
=============================

7.1 General requirements
------------------------

An MBMS capable mobile station shall be able to receive at least one
MBMS service. The mobile station shall also be able to receive multiple
services if they are transmitted on the same carrier (provided that the
MBMS multislot capabilities of the mobile station are not exceeded). The
simultaneous reception of multiple services on different carriers shall
be dependent upon mobile station capabilities.

A mobile station receiving an MBMS p-t-m transmission shall be in
*broadcast/multicast receive mode.* This state is defined only for the
mobile station; from the network\'s point of view, the mobile station
shall be in packet idle mode. However, if the network has indicated in
the assignment message that the mobile station does not need to listen
to the (P)CCCH and (P)BCCH in parallel to the MBMS data, and the mobile
station has an MS\_ID on that MBMS radio bearer, the network needs to
keep track of such mobile station listening to that MBMS radio bearer in
order to send CS and/or PS paging messages on the PACCH/D.

Unless the network has indicated in the assignment message that the
mobile station does not need to listen to the (P)BCCH and (P)CCCH in
parallel to the MBMS data, the mobile station shall, in parallel to the
MBMS data, read system information for the serving cell from the
broadcast control channel and CS and/or PS paging messages from its
paging group on the paging channel(s) allocated in the cell. Reading
system information and paging messages takes precedence over listening
to the MBMS session.

NOTE: In case the network does not provide system information and paging
messages on the PACCH, the location of the MBMS bearer with respect to
the control channels should be chosen such that it will be possible for
the mobile station to read all the PDCHs of the MBMS radio bearer while
monitoring the control channels.

A mobile station receiving MBMS shall operate in Network Control mode
NC0 (see 3GPP TS 45.008 \[9\]) even if it had been commanded otherwise
by the network. If in GMM-Ready state, the mobile station shall move to
NC0 upon the start of the MBMS session. Upon termination of the MBMS
session, the mobile station shall revert to the control mode commanded
by the network before the start of the MBMS session if the mobile
station is still in GMM-Ready state.

7.2 Mobile Station tasks
------------------------

When in broadcast/multicast receive mode, the requirements for
monitoring the received signal level of neighbouring cells shall be the
same as those for packet idle mode (see 3GPP TS 45.008 \[9\]). For the
reconfirmation of the BSIC of neighbouring cells, however, the
requirements for packet transfer mode shall apply (see 3GPP TS 45.008
\[9\]).

If the PBCCH is not present in the serving cell, a mobile station in
broadcast/multicast receive mode shall not attempt to decode the BCCH
data block that contains the parameters affecting cell reselection for
non-serving cells that have been provided by the System Information (see
3GPP TS 45.008 \[9\]). Instead, this information shall be provided by
the serving cell either on BCCH or on PACCH.

The behaviour of the MS which does not receive in time or does not
receive at all this information is defined in 3GPP TS 43.022 \[10\].

Mobile stations in broadcast/multicast receive mode shall obey the
intra-RAT and inter-RAT cell reselection algorithms defined for the GMM
Ready state (see3GPP TS 45.008).

A mobile station in broadcast/multicast receive mode shall be able to
respond to a PACKET POLLING REQUEST message as defined in 3GPP TS 44.060
when addressed with its TLLI. It shall also be able to receive a PACKET
POWER CONTROL/TIMING ADVANCE message and act accordingly (see 3GPP TS
44.060).

7.3 Multislot capabilities
--------------------------

The multislot capability of an MBMS capable mobile station shall be such
that the mobile station is capable of receiving on up to 5 timeslots per
frame and the timeslots shall be assigned within a window of maximum
size Rx=6.

An MBMS capable mobile station shall be capable of receiving MBMS:

\- on up to 4 timeslots simultaneously, if the MS must listen to the
(P)BCCH and (P)CCCH in addition to the timeslots assigned for MBMS data
transfer; or

\- on up to 5 timeslots simultaneously, if PBCCH/PCCCH is mapped on one
of the PDCHs assigned to the MBMS session and the number of timeslots
assigned to the PCCCH is equal to one; or

\- on up to 5 timeslots simultaneously, if the network transmits system
information and paging messages on the PACCH of the MBMS radio bearer.

> NOTE: The downlink timeslots could be used to receive multiple MBMS
> sessions in parallel (see subclause 6.4).

If data transfer is with ARQ (see subclause 6.3), the mobile station
shall additionally be capable of transmitting on up to two timeslots.
The number of timeslots allocated for the reception of MBMS (*m*) and
the number of timeslots allocated for transmission (*n*) shall be such
that the sum of *m* and *n* does not exceed 6 (5 in case the mobile
station needs to listen to the (P)BCCH and (P)CCCH in addition to the
timeslots assigned for MBMS data transfer).

Regardless of the data transfer method, the mobile station shall
additionally be capable of reading the (P)BCCH and the (P)CCCH on up to
one additional timeslot in those frames where the mobile station is
required to read the (packet) broadcast control channel or the (packet)
common control channel. The network can however indicate in the
assignment message that the mobile station will receive system
information and CS and/or PS paging messages on the PACCH/D of the MBMS
radio bearer. In that case, the mobile station shall not listen to the
(P)BCCH and the (P)CCCH in parallel to the MBMS data (see sub-clause
6.6).

NOTE: This will be possible without interrupting the reception of MBMS
only if allowed by the relative location of the (packet) control
channels and of the MBMS traffic channel and depending on the number of
timeslots allocated to MBMS (see Annex B), unless system information for
the serving cell and CS and/or PS paging messages are transferred on the
PACCH/D.

If the number of timeslots allocated to the (P)CCCH is higher than one,
the number of timeslots on which MBMS can be received may be reduced.

7.4 MBMS notification for mobile stations in dedicated mode or packet transfer mode or dual transfer mode
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A mobile station in class A mode of operation which supports the MBMS
feature and requires notification of commencing MBMS sessions during
dedicated mode operation shall perform the service information sending
procedure:

\- at the earliest opportunity after the early Classmark sending
procedure and any DTM related signalling, if and only if the dedicated
mode MBMS notification feature is supported in the cell; or

\- if the P-TMSI of the MS is reallocated during the CS connection and
the dedicated mode MBMS notification feature is supported in the cell;
or

\- on the main DCCH of a target cell after successfully completing the
handover procedure, if indicated to do so in the HANDOVER COMMAND
message and the dedicated mode MBMS notification feature is supported in
the target cell.

8 Network requirements
======================

8.1 General requirements
------------------------

In a network providing MBMS services, the support of the PBCCH is not
mandatory.

If the PBCCH is not present in a cell, the network shall provide the
parameters affecting cell reselection towards neighbouring cells either
on BCCH or on the PACCH.

For each session in a given cell, the network may provide MBMS
neighbouring cell information as described in sub-clause 6.2.1.

If the PBCCH is allocated, the support of NMO I is mandatory.

NOTE: If NMO III is used, the mobile station may need to interrupt the
reception of MBMS to listen to CS paging messages.

The network may transmit an MBMS session on up to 4 timeslots,
regardless of whether data transfer is with or without ARQ (see
subclause 6.3).

8.2 MBMS notification for mobile stations in dedicated mode or packet transfer mode or dual transfer mode
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The network indicates whether the network supports the Dedicated MBMS
Notification mechanism and therefore whether the mobile stations are
allowed to send the SERVICE INFORMATION message or include information
in the GPRS SUSPENSION REQUEST message being sent to the network on the
main DCCH.

The network may notify a mobile station that has requested to be
notified on the main DCCH of starting MBMS sessions when in dedicated
mode or MAC-Dedicated state, using the MBMS ANNOUNCEMENT message.

The network may inform a mobile station in the HANDOVER COMMAND message
that a mobile station after completing the Handover procedure should
re-request the network to send notifications on the main DCCH for
starting MBMS sessions, if previously requested.

Note: The network should ensure that any transmissions of the MBMS
ANNOUNCEMENT message, for the purpose of notifying the mobile station of
the start of an MBMS session, are only sent to mobile stations that
joined that MBMS session.

######## Annex A (normative): Requirements and recommendations

--------------------------

1\) MBMS shall utilise the radio resource in an efficient manner.

2\) MBMS data transfer shall be downlink only.

3\) The reception of MBMS data blocks in p-t-m is not guaranteed at the

A.3.1 GERAN recommendations
---------------------------

1\) MBMS charging should be transparent to the GERAN.

######## Annex B (informative): Physical channel allocation scenarios

In this Annex, the maximum number of timeslots that can be received by
an MBMS capable mobile station in different scenarios is investigated.
This investigation is useful in the case of the reception of multiple
sessions. The maximum number of timeslots that an MBMS session can be
transmitted upon is 4. When transmitting multiple sessions on the same
carrier, the network can choose one of the options in subclause 6.4.1;
depending on the number of timeslots allocated to each session and which
of the options in subclause 6.4.1 is chosen, the mobile station may or
may not be able to listen to more than one session in parallel.

Only the cases where the mobile station needs to listen to the (P)CCCH
and (P)BCCH in parallel to the MBMS data are analysed in this Annex. The
analysis is carried out under the assumption that the mobile station is
able to read both the (packet) broadcast control channel and the
(packet) common control channel without having to interrupt the
reception of MBMS and the transmission on the uplink feedback channel,
if established. Additionally, in all the scenarios the maximum number of
timeslots is calculated assuming that both the (P)BCCH and the (P)CCCH
are located on only one timeslot; if this assumption is not satisfied
(i.e. additional timeslots are used for (P)CCCH), the number of
timeslots that MBMS can be received upon will be reduced.

Throughout the Annex, the maximum number of timeslots for each scenario
is calculated assuming that the mobile station capabilities require
T~tb~ = 1 and T~ra~ = 1 (see 3GPP TS 45.002 \[8\]).

NOTE: Due to the fact that T~ra~ = 1, neighbour cell measurements are
not indicated in the figures.

The maximum number of timeslots will depend on whether an uplink
feedback channel per MBMS session is established or not (see subclause
6.3). In case where an uplink feedback channel per MBMS session is
established, for simplicity reasons in the following it is assumed that
(any of) the uplink feedback channel(s) is(are) established on the same
uplink timeslot.

The material in this Annex is not meant to provide an exhaustive
analysis but only to give some general guidance.

B.1 Data transfer when no uplink feedback channel is established
================================================================

B.1.1 PBCCH not deployed, transmission with frequency hopping
-------------------------------------------------------------

Figure B.1

Figure B.1 shows that it is possible to have the simultaneous reception
of paging or broadcast channel and MBMS data if MBMS sessions are
received on up to 4 timeslots.

NOTE: In this scenario, it would be possible to receive multiple MBMS
sessions on up to 5 timeslots, still meeting the requirement of T~ra~ =
1; however, this exceeds the required multislot capabilities of an MBMS
capable mobile station.

It is assumed that channel combination iv (BCCH+CCCH+FCCH+SCH) is
allocated on TN 0 of the BCCH carrier. If the CCCH is located on other
timeslots in addition to timeslot 0, the number of timeslots that MBMS
can be received on is reduced. For example, if a second timeslot is
allocated to the CCCH (i.e. BS\_CC\_CHANS = 2), then it necessarily has
to be timeslot 2 (see 3GPP TS 45.002 \[8\]). Therefore only timeslots 4,
5 and 6 can be used for the transmission of MBMS, and the maximum number
of timeslots is reduced to 3.

B.1.2 PBCCH not deployed, transmission without frequency hopping
----------------------------------------------------------------

Figure B.2

Figure B.2 shows that in this scenario the maximum number of timeslots
that one or more MBMS sessions can be received upon is 4.

NOTE: It would be possible to receive multiple MBMS sessions on up to 6
timeslots, still meeting the requirement of T~ra~ = 1, but this exceeds
the required multislot capabilities of an MBMS capable mobile station.

B.1.3 PBCCH deployed, transmission with frequency hopping
---------------------------------------------------------

Figure B.3

Figure B.3 shows that in this scenario the maximum number of timeslots
that one or more MBMS sessions can be received upon is 4.

NOTE 1: It would be possible to receive multiple MBMS sessions on up to
6 timeslots, still meeting the requirement of T~ra~ = 1, but this
exceeds the required multislot capabilities of an MBMS capable mobile
station.

It is assumed that channel combination xi
(PBCCH+PCCCH+PDTCH/F+PACCH/F+PTCCH/F) is present on TN 0 and that all
the PCCCH blocks are located on the same timeslot as the PBCCH (i.e. no
PCCCH blocks are located on other timeslots).

NOTE 2: As paging coordination is mandatory in the network for MBMS, the
mobile station does not need to read the BCCH and the CCCH.

It is also assumed that both the PBCCH and the MBMS traffic channels use
frequency hopping, that the hopping pattern is the same and that, in
every frame, the PBCCH and the MBMS traffic channels are transmitted on
the same frequency. If the hopping pattern is not the same, the maximum
number of timeslots that one or more MBMS sessions can be received upon
is still 4.

B.2 Data transfer when an uplink feedback channel is established
================================================================

B.2.1 PBCCH not deployed, transmission with frequency hopping
-------------------------------------------------------------

Figure B.4

In this configuration, it is assumed that the BCCH and the CCCH are
located on timeslot 0 (with no additional timeslots assigned to CCCH).
As shown in Figure B.4, the mobile station is able to transmit also when
the BCCH or the CCCH need to be read, if one or more MBMS sessions are
received on up to 3 timeslots.

NOTE 1: If in a frame the MS needs to read the BCCH or CCCH and transmit
on the uplink, the MS will need to perform three switchings within that
frame.

NOTE 2: After receving a (pre-)notification for a new session while
listening to an ongoing session, the mobile station enters non-DRX mode
and listens to all the paging blocks on the CCCH to receive a(n)
(notification)assignment. As the time elapsing until the assignment
received on the mobile station side (see subclauses 6.1.1.2, 6.1.1.3,
6.1.1.4) could last for a considerable length of time (up to the value
of T3214, which is equal to 60 seconds, see 3GPP TS 44.018 and 3GPP TS
44.060), the worst case is in those frames where the mobile station is
required to: read 1 timeslot for BCCH or CCCH, use 1 timeslot for
switching from the reception of BCCH/CCCH to the reception of MBMS, read
3 timeslots for MBMS and transmit on 1 timeslot to send feedback. In
this scenario the sum of RX and TX is equal to 6; this leaves only 2
timeslots for switching. As the mobile station needs to be able to
perform neighbour cell measurements during these periods, it follows
that T~tb~ = 1 and T~ra~ = 1.

B.2.2 PBCCH not deployed, transmission without frequency hopping
----------------------------------------------------------------

Figure B.5

In this scenario, the maximum number of timeslots that one or more MBMS
sessions can be received upon is 4. This assumes that both the BCCH and
the CCCH are located on timeslot 0.

NOTE: After receving a (pre-)notification for a new session while
listening to an ongoing session, the mobile station enters non-DRX mode
and listens to all the paging blocks on the CCCH to receive a(n)
(notification)assignment. As the time elapsing until the assignment
received on the mobile station side (see subclauses 6.1.1.2, 6.1.1.3,
6.1.1.4) could last for a considerable length of time (up to the value
of T3214, which is equal to 60 seconds, see 3GPP TS 44.018 and 3GPP TS
44.060), the worst case is in those frames where the mobile station is
required to: read 1 timeslot for BCCH or CCCH, read 4 timeslots for MBMS
and transmit on 1 timeslot to send feedback. In this scenario the sum of
RX and TX is equal to 6; this leaves only 2 timeslots for switching. As
the mobile station needs to be able to perform neighbour cell
measurements during these periods, it follows that T~tb~ = 1 and T~ra~ =
1.

B.2.3 PBCCH deployed, transmission with frequency hopping
---------------------------------------------------------

Figure B.6

Figure B.6 shows that in this scenario the maximum number of timeslots
that one or more MBMS sessions can be received upon is 4.

It is assumed that the PBCCH and the PCCCH are located on a single
timeslot. If the PCCCH is transmitted on more than one timeslot, then
the number of timeslots that one or more MBMS sessions can be received
upon is reduced accordingly.

NOTE 1: As paging coordination is mandatory in the network for MBMS, the
mobile station does not need to read the BCCH and the CCCH.

NOTE 2: After receving a (pre-)notification for a new session while
listening to an ongoing session, the mobile station enters non-DRX mode
and listens to all the paging blocks on the PCCCH to receive a(n)
(notification)assignment. As the time elapsing until the assignment
received on the mobile station side (see subclauses 6.1.1.2, 6.1.1.3,
6.1.1.4) could last for a considerable length of time (up to the value
of T3214, which is equal to 60 seconds, see 3GPP TS 44.060), the worst
case is in those frames where the mobile station is required to: read 1
timeslot for PBCCH or PCCCH, read 4 timeslots for MBMS and transmit on 1
timeslot to send feedback. In this scenario the sum of RX and TX is
equal to 6; this leaves only 2 timeslots for switching. As the mobile
station needs to be able to perform neighbour cell measurements during
these periods, it follows that T~tb~ = 1 and T~ra~ = 1.

It is also assumed that both the PBCCH and the MBMS traffic channels use
frequency hopping, that the hopping pattern is the same and that, in
every frame, the PBCCH and the MBMS traffic channels are transmitted on
the same frequency. If the hopping pattern is not the same, the maximum
number of timeslots that multiple MBMS sessions can be received upon is
reduced to 3.

NOTE 3: If the hopping pattern is not the same and in a frame the MS
needs to read the PBCCH or PCCCH and transmit on the uplink, the MS will
need to perform three switchings within that frame.
