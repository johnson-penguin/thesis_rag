1 Scope
=======

1.1 General
-----------

The present document specifies the procedures used at the radio
interface (Reference Point Um, see 3GPPÂ TSÂ 24.002) for Radio Resource
management. The Radio Resource Control Protocol (RRC) is specified. RRC
is the Radio Resource control plane protocol for Radio Resource
management that is used when a mobile station is operating in Iu mode.

Notation \"Reserved sub-clauseÂ number\" is used to indicate which
sub-clauses of the specification were moved from this part of the
standard to the other part when this standard was split between RAN and
CN parts.

When the notations for \"further study\" or \"FS\" or \"FFS\" are
present in this specification they mean that the indicated text is not a
normative portion of this standard.

These procedures are defined in terms of messages exchanged over the
control channels of the radio interface. The control channels are
described in 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.003.

The structured functions and procedures of this protocol and the
relationship with other layers and entities are described in general
terms in 3GPPÂ TSÂ 24.007.

1.2 Scope of the Technical Specification
----------------------------------------

The procedures currently described in the present document are for radio
resource management for circuit switched and GPRS services.

3GPPÂ TSÂ 24.010 contains functional procedures for support of
supplementary services.

3GPPÂ TSÂ 24.011 contains functional procedures for support of
point-to-point short message services.

3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.012 contains functional description of short message cell
broadcast.

3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.060 contains procedures for radio link control and medium
access control (RLC/MAC) of packet data physical channels.

3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.071 contains functional descriptions and procedures for
support of location services.

3GPPÂ TSÂ 24.008 contains the procedures for CN protocols.

NOTE: \"layer 3\" includes the functions and protocols described in this
Technical Specification. The terms \"data link layer\" and \"layer 2\"
are used interchangeably to refer to the layer immediately below layer
3.

1.3 Application to the interface structures
-------------------------------------------

The layer 3 procedures apply to the interface structures defined in
3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.003. They use the functions and services provided by layer 2
defined in 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.005 and 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.006. 3GPPÂ TSÂ 24.007 gives the
general description of layer 3 including procedures, messages format and
error handling.

1.4 Structure of layer 3 procedures
-----------------------------------

A building block method is used to describe the layer 3 procedures.

The basic building blocks are \"elementary procedures\" provided by the
protocol control entities of the three sublayers, i.e. radio resource
management, mobility management and connection management sublayer.

Complete layer 3 transactions consist of specific sequences of
elementary procedures. The term \"structured procedure\" is used for
these sequences.

1.5 Test procedures
-------------------

Test procedures of the GSMÂ radio interface signalling are described in
3GPPÂ TSÂ 51.010 and 3GPPÂ TSÂ 51.02x series.

1.6 Applicability of implementations
------------------------------------

NOTE: This sub-clause is FFS.

3 Definitions, symbols and abbreviations
========================================

3.1 Definitions
---------------

The following terms are used in this Technical Specification:

***A/Gb mode*:** mode of operation of the MS when connected to the Core
Network via GERAN and the A and/or Gb interfaces.

***Access Stratum (AS)***: defined in 3GPPÂ TSÂ 23.101.

***Active Transport Channel***: a transport channel is active during a
TTI if it carries a transport block.

***\"channel set\"***: is used to identify TCHs that carry related user
information flows, e.g., in a multislot configuration used to support
circuit switched connection(s), which therefore need to be handled
together.

***Dynamic attributes***: for one transport channel, the values of the
dynamic attributes are different among transport formats. They are
configured by Layer 3 and can change on a TTI basis under the control of
the MAC sublayer.

***Empty Transport Format***: a transport format such that no transport
block is carried over the transport channel (i.e. the transport channel
is inactive).

***Empty Transport Format Combination***: a transport format combination
that is made up only of empty transport formats.

***Inactive Transport Channel***: a transport channel is inactive during
a TTI if it does not carry a transport block (i.e. the transport block
size is zero).

***Iu mode***: mode of operation of the MS when connected to the Core
Network via GERAN or UTRAN and the Iu interface.

***Non Access Stratum (NAS)***: defined in 3GPPÂ TSÂ 21.905.

***RR idle***: defined in 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.018.

***RR***: Radio Resource control plane protocol for radio resource
management that is used when a mobile station is operating in *A/Gb
mode*.

***RRC***: Radio Resource control plane protocol for radio resource
management that is used when a mobile station is operating in Iu mode.

***RRC Connection***: A point-to-point bi-directional connection between
RRC peer entities in the MS and the GERAN characterised by the
allocation of a G-RNTI. An MS has either zero or one RRC connection.

***RRC-Idle mode***: In RRC-Idle mode, the MS has no established RRC
connection.

***RRC-Connected mode***: In RRC-Connected mode, the MS has an
established RRC connection.

***Inter-RAT handover***: indicates the transfer of the connection,
under the control of the network, between the MS and two different radio
access technologies (e.g. UMTS to GERAN Iu mode).

***Inter-mode handover***: indicates the transfer of the connection,
under the control of the network, between the MS and GERAN *Iu mode*
to/from GERAN *A/Gb mode*.

***R:*** Retransmission number (*R* = 0 for first transmission, *R* = 1
for first retransmission, ..., *R* = *n* for the *n*^th^
retransmission). When there is no retransmission, *R* = 0 always.

***RR group receive mode***: defined in 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.018.

***RR dedicated mode***: defined in 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.018.

***RR group transmit mode***: defined in 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.018.

the semi-static attributes are common to all transport formats. They are
configured by Layer 3 and can only be changed by Layer 3 signalling.

***Transport Block (TB)***: block exchanged on a transport channel
between the physical layer and the MAC sublayer.

***Temporary block flow (TBF)***: is defined in 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.060.

***Transport Channel (TrCH)***: a transport channel is offered by the
physical layer to the MAC sublayer for exchange of transport blocks. A
transport channel is used to carry with a certain quality of service, a
data flow over the radio interface.

***Transport Format (TF)***: configuration of a transport channel,
including for instance channel coding, CRC size, etc.

***Transport Format Combination (TFC)***: allowed combination of
transport format(s) of the different transport channels that are
multiplexed together on a basic physical subchannel.

that indicates the transport channel combination that has been selected
for each radio packet.

***Transport Format Combination Set (TFCS)***: set of allowed transport
format combinations on a basic physical subchannel.

***Transport Format Indicator (TFIN)***: index identifying a particular
transport format within the transport format set.

***Transport Format Set (TFS)***: set of all transport formats defined

***Transmission Time Interval (TTI)***: rate at which transport blocks
are exchanged between the physical layer and the MAC sublayer on a
transport channel.

The network modes of operation for GERAN *Iu mode* are:

NMO I: the network has a Gs interface. The network sends CS paging and
PS paging messages for an attached MS via the SGSN and the Iu-ps
interface to GERAN Iu. Paging co-ordination is achieved at the SGSN
thanks to the Gs interface. GERAN Iu pages the MS on PACCH if available,
else PCCCH. MS can initiate combined procedures according to its
capabilities.

NMO II: the network has no Gs interface. For an attached MS, the network
sends CS paging messages, via the MSC plus the Iu-cs interface, and
sends PS paging messages, via the SGSN plus the Iu-ps interface to GERAN
Iu. GERAN Iu performs paging co-ordination and pages the MS on PACCH if
available, else PCCCH. MSs cannot initiate combined procedures.

NOTE: 3GPPÂ TSÂ 21.905 may need to be updated.

3.3 Random values
-----------------

In a number of places in this Technical Specification, it is mentioned
that some value must take a \"random\" value, in a given range, or more
generally with some statistical distribution. Such cases interest only
the Mobile Station.

It is required that there is a low probability that two MSs in the same
conditions (including the case of two MSs of the same type from the same
manufacturer) will choose the same value. Moreover, it is required that,
if it happens that two MSs in similar conditions choose the same value,
the probability of their choices being identical at the next occasion is
the same as if their first choices had been different.

The meaning of such a specification is that any statistical test for
these values, done on a series of similar events, will obtain a result
statistically compatible with the specified distribution. This shall
hold even in the cases where the tests are conducted with a subset of
possible events, with some common parameters. Moreover, basic tests of
independence of the values within the series shall pass.

Data against which correlation with the values shall not be found are
the protocol state, or the IMSI, or identities or other unrelated
information broadcast by the network, or the current TDMA frame number.

4 RRC Functions and Services provided to upper layers
=====================================================

4.1 RRC Functions
-----------------

RRC performs following functions. A more detailed description of the
functions can be found in 3GPPÂ TSÂ 43.051.

\- Broadcast of information provided by the Non-Access stratum (Core
Network)

\- Broadcast of information related to the access stratum

\- Establishment, re-establishment, maintenance and release of an RRC
connection between the MS and GERAN

\- Establishment, reconfiguration and release of Radio Bearers

\- Assignment, reconfiguration and release of radio resources for the
RRC connection

\- RRC connection mobility functions

\- Release of signalling connections

\- Paging/notification

\- Listening to BCCH

\- Routing of higher layer PDUs

\- Control of requested QoS

\- MS measurement reporting and control of the reporting

\- Power control

\- Control of ciphering

\- Integrity protection

\- Support for Location Services

\- Timing advance control

4.2 RRC Services provided to upper layers
-----------------------------------------

The RRC offers the following services to upper layers (NAS), a
description and primitives of these services are provided in
3GPPÂ TSÂ 43.051 and 3GPPÂ TSÂ 23.110.

\- General Control;

\- Notification;

\- Dedicated control.

The RRC layer provides the MS GERAN portion of signalling connections to
the upper layers to support the exchange of upper layer\'s information
flow. The signalling connection is used between the mobile station and
the core network to transfer upper layer information. For each core
network domain, at most one signalling connection may exist at the same
time. The RRC layer maps the signalling connections for one MS on a
single RRC connection. For the upper layer data transfer on signalling
connections, the RRC layer supports the discrimination between two
different classes, named \"High priority\" (corresponding to \"SAPI 0\"
when using RR) realised using SRB3 and \"Low priority\" (corresponding
to \"SAPI 3\" when using RR) realised using SRB4.

5 Services expected from lower layers
=====================================

5.1 Services required from layer 2 and physical layers
------------------------------------------------------

RRC uses RLC/MAC as layer 2 in the control plane, except for operation
on the BCCH, where the data link layer as specified in 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.006 is
used (see 3GPPÂ TSÂ 43.051).

5.2 Signalling Radio Bearers
----------------------------

The Radio Bearers used for transferring signalling messages are called
Signalling Radio Bearers (SRBs). The SRBs are defined as:

\- SRB1 is used to carry RRC signaling performed in support of Access
Stratum specific needs (RLC operates in unacknowledged mode).

\- SRB2 is used to carry RRC signaling performed in support of Access
Stratum specific needs (RLC operates in acknowledged mode).

\- SRB3 is used to carry RRC signaling performed in support of
Non-Access Stratum specific needs (RLC operates in acknowledged mode).

\- SRB4 is used to carry RRC signaling performed in support of
Non-Access Stratum specific needs (RLC operates in acknowledged mode).

6 RRC Protocol modes and states
===============================

6.1 General
-----------

An overall picture of the transitions between RR modes of operation and
RRC states and modes is in Figure 6.1.1. The RRC modes are RRC-Idle mode
and RRC-Connected mode. RRC-Connected mode consists of three different
RRC states RRC-Cell\_Shared, RRC-Cell\_Dedicated and RRC-GRA\_PCH. The
RR modes of operation are RR Dedicated mode, RR Group receive mode, RR
Group transmit mode, RR Packet Idle mode, RR Packet Transfer mode and RR
DTM (see 3GPPÂ TSÂ 43.064).

RR Group receive mode and RR Group transmit Mode are not described in
Figure 6.1.1.

Figure 6.1.1: Transitions between RR modes of operation and RRC states
and modes.

6.2 Relation between Iu mode and A/Gb mode
------------------------------------------

### 6.2.1 Handover between Iu and A/Gb modes

When a handover which results in change from *Iu mode* (i.e. from the
RRC-Cell\_Dedicated state) to *A/Gb mode* is performed, the RR dedicated
mode of operation shall be entered.

When a handover which results in change from *A/Gb mode* (i.e. from the
RR dedicated mode of operation) to *Iu mode* is performed, the
RRC-Cell\_Dedicated state shall be entered. If handover to *Iu mode* is
triggered in RR dual transfer mode of operation, the RR dedicated mode
of operation shall be entered before the handover is initiated.

### 6.2.2 Cell reselection between Iu and A/Gb mode

Cell reselection in this sub-clause refers to aborting the operation in
the old cell and switching to the new selected cell.

When a cell reselection which results in change from *Iu mode* (i.e from
the RRC-Idle Mode) to *A/Gb mode* is performed, the RR Idle/ RR Packet
Idle mode of operation shall be entered. If cell reselection is
triggered in RRC-Cell\_Shared or RRC-GRA\_PCH state, the RRC-Idle mode
shall be entered before the cell reselection is initiated.

When a cell reselection which result in change from *A/Gb mode* (i.e.
from the RR Idle/RR packet Idle mode of operation) to *Iu mode*, is
performed the RRC-Idle mode shall be entered. If cell reselection is
triggered in RR Packet Transfer mode of operation, the RR packet Idle
mode of operation shall be entered before the cell reselection is
initiated.

6.2a Relation between GERAN Iu mode RRC and UTRA RRC
----------------------------------------------------

### 6.2a.1 Handover between GERAN Iu mode and UTRAN

When a handover which results in change from GERAN *Iu mode* (i.e.
RRC-Cell\_Dedicated state) to UTRAN is performed, the UTRAN RRC
connected mode of operation shall be entered.

When a handover which results in change from UTRAN (i.e. from the UTRA
RRC Cell\_DCH state) to GERAN *Iu mode* is performed, the
RRC-Cell\_Dedicated state shall be entered.

### 6.2a.2 Cell reselection between GERAN Iu mode and UTRAN

Cell reselection in this sub-clause refers to aborting the operation in
the old cell and switching to the new selected cell.

When a cell reselection which results in change from GERAN *Iu mode* to
UTRAN is performed, when the MS is in RRC-Idle mode, the Idle mode of
operation shall be entered.

When a cell reselection which results in change from GERAN *Iu mode* to
UTRAN is performed, when the MS is in GERAN RRC-Cell\_Shared state, the
MS shall initiate the cell update procedure and enter the UTRAN RRC
CELL\_FACH state. If the cell update is rejected by UTRAN, the MS shall
release the RRC connection according to the cell update failure case and
enter Idle mode.

When a cell reselection which results in change from GERAN *Iu mode* to
UTRAN is performed, when the MS is in GERAN RRC-GRA\_PCH state, the MS
shall enter the UTRAN RRC URA\_PCH state. If the GRA identity which the
MS had been assigned to in GERAN is not present in the list of URA
identities broadcast in the UTRAN cell, the MS shall initiate the UTRAN
URA update procedure. If the URA update is rejected by UTRAN, the MS
shall release the RRC connection according to the URA update failure
case and enter Idle mode.

When a cell reselection which results in change from UTRAN to GERAN *Iu
mode* is performed, when the MS is in UTRAN RRC-Cell\_FACH or Cell\_PCH
state, the MS shall initiate the cell update procedure and enter the
GERAN RRC Cell Shared state. If the cell update is rejected by GERAN,
the MS shall release the RRC connection according to the cell update
failure case and enter RRC Idle mode in GERAN *Iu mode*.

When a cell reselection which results in change from UTRAN to GERAN *Iu
mode* is performed, when the MS is in UTRAN RRC-URA\_PCH state, the MS
shall enter the GERAN RRC GRA\_PCH state. . If the URA identity which
the MS had been assigned to in UTRAN is not present in the list of GRA
identities broadcast in the GERAN cell, the MS shall initiate the GERAN
GRA update procedure. If the GRA update is rejected by GERAN, the MS
shall release the RRC connection according to the GRA update failure
case and enter RRC Idle mode in GERAN *Iu mode*.

6.3 RR modes of operation
-------------------------

The RR modes of operation are described in 3GPPÂ TSÂ 43.064.

6.4 RRC modes and states
------------------------

### 6.4.1 RRC-Idle Mode

#### 6.4.1.1 General

After power on having selected the *Iu mode*, the MS enters RRC-Idle
mode. The MS stays in RRC-Idle mode until a successful establishment of
a RRC Connection. In RRC-Idle mode the connection of the MS is closed on
all layers of the access stratum. In RRC-Idle mode the MS is identified
by Non-Access stratum identities such as IMSI, TMSI and P-TMSI. In
addition, the GERAN has no own information about the individual MS\'s in
RRC-Idle mode, and it can only address e.g. all MS\'s in a cell
(broadcasting) or all MS\'s monitoring a paging occasion.

#### 6.4.1.2 Transition from RRC-Idle Mode to RRC-Connected mode

The transition to the RRC-Connected mode from the RRC-Idle mode can only
be initiated by the MS by transmitting a request for an RRC Connection.
The event is triggered by a request from upper layers in the MS.

At RRC connection establishment the MS is assigned a GERAN radio network
temporary identity (G-RNTI) to be used as MS identity on both common
control channels and traffic channels.

When the MS receives a message from the network that confirms the RRC
connection establishment, the MS enters the RRC-Connected mode. The
RRC-Connected mode is characterised by three states: RRC-Cell\_Shared,
RRC-Cell\_Dedicated and RRC-GRA\_PCH.

### 6.4.2 RRC-Connected mode: RRC-Cell\_Shared state

#### 6.4.2.1 General

RRC-Cell\_Shared state is characterized by:

\- no dedicated basic physical subchannel (DBPSCH) is allocated to the
MS.

\- the position of the MS is known by GERAN on cell level according to
the cell where the MS last made a cell update.

In RRC-Cell\_Shared state the MS shall perform the following actions:

1\> initiate a Cell Update procedure on cell change to *Iu mode* in
another GERAN or UTRAN cell;

1\> transmit signalling messages and user data in the uplink and/or the
downlink using PDTCH when the MS is assigned use of those resources;

1\> the management of radio resources within the cell is handled at MAC
level;

1\> listen to the PBCCH control channel of the serving cell for the
decoding of system information messages;

1\> listen to neighbouring cells for neighbour cell measurements (see
3GPPÂ TSÂ 45.008);

1\> use G-RNTI assigned in the current cell as the MS identity on common
control channels.

NOTE: In that state, if the network wants to initiate any activity, no
paging request is required to be sent. The network can directly allocate
radio resources to the MS.

#### 6.4.2.2 Transition from RRC-Cell\_Shared state to RRC-Idle Mode

The transition to RRC-Idle Mode is realised through the release of the
RRC connection.

#### 6.4.2.3 Transition from RRC-Cell\_Shared state to RRC-Cell\_Dedicated state

The transition from RRC-Cell\_Shared state to RRC-Cell\_Dedicated state
occurs when a DBPSCH is allocated to the MS.

#### 6.4.2.4 Transition from RRC-Cell\_Shared state to RRC-GRA\_PCH state

The transition occurs when GERAN orders the MS to move to RRC-GRA\_PCH
state via explicit signaling.

When such a transition occurs, the mobile station shall abort any TBF in
progress by immediately ceasing to decode the downlink, ceasing to
transmit on the uplink, stopping all RLC/MAC timers except for timers
related to measurement reporting, prior to moving to RRC-GRA\_PCH state.

#### 6.4.2.5 Radio resource allocation tasks

RRC is in this state responsible for allocating dedicated basic physical
subchannels, which causes the MS to enter the RRC-Cell\_Dedicated state.
MAC is responsible for allocating / reallocating / releasing shared
basic physical subchannels (SBPSCH) (see 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.160). This
allocation of the PDTCHs by MAC is done according to the QoS class of
the radio bearer and multislot capability of the MS. The RRC provides
the MAC with QoS class and indication of the MS multislot capability.

#### 6.4.2.6 RRC connection mobility tasks

In RRC-Cell\_Shared state the MS shall initiate a Cell Update procedure
when:

1\> a new GERAN cell has been selected and the MS operates in *Iu mode*,
or

1\> a UTRAN cell has been selected.

1\> when T305 in the MS expires and the MS is operating in *Iu mode*.

When the GERAN cell has been selected that would require the MS to
operate in the *A/Gb mode* then the MS shall enter the RRC-Idle Mode,
enter RR Idle or RR Packet Idle Mode of operation. Access in the cell
will then be made according to the *A/Gb* *mode* procedures.

#### 6.4.2.7 MS measurements

MAC is responsible for measurement reporting, using the procedures
defined in 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.060.

### 6.4.3 RRC-Connected mode: RRC-Cell\_Dedicated state

#### 6.4.3.1 General

RRC-Cell\_Dedicated state is characterized by:

\- the MS is assigned one or more dedicated basic physical subchannels
(see 3GPPÂ TSÂ 43.051) in the uplink and downlink, which it can use
anytime. Furthermore, the MS may be assigned one or more shared basic
physical subchannels.

\- the position of the MS is known by GERAN on cell level.

In RRC-Cell\_Dedicated state the MS shall perform the following actions:

1\> perform necessary procedures for measurement reporting;

1\> listen to neighbouring cells for neighbouring cell measurements (see
3GPPÂ TSÂ 45.008);

1\> perform a handover procedure of the dedicated basic physical
subchannels on cell change of another GERAN or UTRAN cell;

1\> transmit signalling message in the uplink using available signalling
radio bearers.

#### 6.4.3.2 Transition from RRC-Cell\_Dedicated state to RRC-Cell\_Shared state

The transition occurs when all the dedicated basic physical subchannels
are released and

1\> shared basic physical subchannels exist; or

1\> no shared basic physical subchannels exist and the network indicates
transition to the RRC-Cell\_Shared state.

#### 6.4.3.3 Transition from RRC-Cell\_Dedicated state to RRC-Idle Mode

The transition to RRC-Idle mode is realised through the release of the
RRC connection.

#### 6.4.3.4 Transition from RRC-Cell\_Dedicated state to RRC-GRA\_PCH state

The transition occurs when GERAN orders the MS to move to the
RRC-GRA\_PCH state via explicit signalling.

When such a signalling is received, the mobile station shall release all
the allocated dedicated basic physical suchannel(s) and, if any, all the
shared basic physical subchannels, prior to moving to RRC-GRA\_PCH
state.

#### 6.4.3.5 Radio resource allocation tasks

RRC is responsible for allocating new dedicated basic physical
subchannels, while MAC or RRC are responsible for allocation of new
shared basic physical subchannels depending on the MAC control state.
RRC is also responsible for intra-cell handovers of dedicated basic
physical sub-channels.

#### 6.4.3.6 RRC connection mobility tasks

RRC connection mobility tasks are realised in RRC-Cell\_Dedicated state
using RRC handover procedures.

#### 6.4.3.7 MS measurements

MS measurement results are signaled using RRC measurement procedures.

### 6.4.4 RRC-Connected mode: RRC-GRA\_PCH state

#### 6.4.4.1 General

The RRC-GRA\_PCH state is characterized by:

\- no physical subchannel is allocated to the MS.

\- the MS may use DRX for monitoring a PCCCH.

\- no uplink activity is possible.

\- the location of the MS is known on GERAN Registration area level.

In this state the MS performs the following actions:

1\> monitor the paging occasions according to the DRX cycle and receive
paging information on the PCCCH;

1\> listen to the PBCCH control channel of the serving cell for the
decoding of system information messages;

1\> initiate a GRA Update procedure upon GRA change.

If the network wants to initiate any activity, it shall make a paging
request on the PCCCH logical channel within the GRA where the MS is.

GRA updating is initiated by the MS, which, upon the detection of the
new GERAN registration area, sends the network the registration area
update information to the new cell. Any activity causes a transition to
either the RRC-Cell\_Shared state or the RRC-Cell\_Dedicated state,
depending on the activity.

#### 6.4.4.2 Transition from RRC-GRA\_PCH state to RRC-Cell\_Shared state

The transition can occur due to GRA update, cell update or answer to
paging. If there has been a cell change since last GRA update, the MS
has to do immediately a cell update except when GRA update is initiated.

#### 6.4.4.3 Transition from RRC-GRA\_PCH state to RRC-Cell\_Dedicated state

When the MS is in RRC-GRA\_PCH state, the MS may request a radio
resource to answer to a paging message or to perform a GRA/Cell Update
procedure. The network may choose to allocate a dedicated resource in
which case the MS enters RRC-Cell\_Dedicated state.

#### 6.4.4.4 Radio resource allocation tasks

No radio resource allocation tasks are executed within this state. In
case of transition to RRC-Cell\_Shared state is needed, the MAC is
responsible for allocating the shared physical subchannels. In case of
transition to RRC-Cell\_Dedicated state is needed, the RRC is
responsible for allocating the physical subdedicated channel.

#### 6.4.4.5 RRC connection mobility tasks

In the RRC-GRA\_PCH state the location of a MS is known on GERAN
Registration area level.

In this state, the MS mobility is performed through Cell Reselection
procedures. The MS shall perform cell reselection and upon selecting a
new GERAN cell belonging to a GRA which does not match the GRA used by
the MS, the MS shall move to RRC-Cell\_Shared state and initiate a GRA
update towards the network. After the GRA Update procedure has been
performed, the MS shall change its state back to RRC-GRA PCH state if
neither the MS nor the network has any more data to transmit.

In RRC-GRA\_PCH state the MS shall initiate:

1\> a GRA Update procedure when a new GERAN cell has been selected that
does not belong to the current registration area and the MS operates in
Iu mode, or

1\> a GRA Update procedure when T305 in the MS expires and the MS is
operating in Iu mode, or

1\> a URA Update procedure when a UTRAN cell has been selected that does
not belong to the current registration area (see 3GPPÂ TSÂ 25.331).

When the GERAN cell has been selected that would require the MS to
operate in the *A/Gb mode* then the MS shall enter the RRC-Idle mode,
then enter RR Idle or RR Packet Idle Mode of operation. Access in the
cell will then be made according to the *A/Gb mode* procedures.

#### 6.4.4.6 MS measurements

The MS monitors the broadcast channels on its own and neighbouring cells
and identifies the need for GRA updating. No measurement reports are
sent to the network in this state.

#### 6.4.4.7 Transfer and update of system information

The MS shall listen to the PBCCH to acquire a valid system information.

7 Radio Resource Control procedures
===================================

7.1 General
-----------

The mobile station can operate either in *A/Gb mode* or in *Iu mode*.
How mobile station selects the operation mode is specified in
3GPPÂ TSÂ 23.221. The behaviour of mobile stations operating in *A/Gb
mode* is specified in 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.018.

After the reception of a message which invoked a procedure, the MS shall
be prepared to receive and act on another message which invokes the
second procedure. Whether this second invocation of a procedure
(transaction) is accepted or rejected by the MS is specified in the
sub-clauses that specifies the procedure. On receiving a message the MS
shall first apply integrity check as appropriate and then proceed with
error handling as specified in clause 8 and 9 before continuing on with
the procedure as specified in the relevant sub-clause. The RRC entity in
the MS shall consider PDUs to have been transmitted when they are
submitted to the lower layers. If the RRC entity in the MS submits a
message for transmission using AM RLC, it shall consider the message
successfully transmitted when GERAN reception of all relevant PDUs is
acknowledged by RLC.

7.2 Change of channels in case of handover
------------------------------------------

### 7.2.1 Change of channel serving SRB1

The RLC procedures for unacknowledged mode, described in 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.160,
do not provide protection against message loss or duplication. No
functionality for handling SRB1 during change of channels is defined, as
SRB1 is used by RRC procedures that are not very sensitive to message
loss or duplication.

### 7.2.2 Change of channel serving SRB2

The RLC procedures for acknowledged mode, described in 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.160,
provide delivery of received messages to the upper layers in the order
they were originally transmitted, provide protection against message
loss, but do not provide protection against message duplication. SRB2 is
used by RRC procedures that need reliable transport service and are
sensitive to message duplication.

When changing channel, the RRC layer will request the RLC layer to
suspend operation on SRB2 before the mobile station leaves the old
channel. When the channel change has been completed, the RRC layer
station will request the RLC layer to resume operation on SRB2. The RLC
layer suspend/resume procedures are described in 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.160.

It may happen that the RLC layer duplicates a message, if it has been
transmitted but not yet completely acknowledged within the RLC layer,
before the mobile station leaves the old channel. However, the RRC layer
controls the channels change in such a way that duplication of RRC
messages does not occur.

### 7.2.3 Change of channel serving SRB3

The RLC procedures for acknowledged mode, described in 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.160,
provide delivery of received messages to the upper layers in the order
they were originally transmitted, provide protection against message
loss, but do not provide protection against message duplication. SRB3 is
used for RRC messages carrying upper layer (NAS) signalling. If these
messages are sensitive to message duplication, the upper layer protocol
should define its own protection mechanism.

### 7.2.4 Change of channel serving SRB4

The RLC procedures for acknowledged mode, described in 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.160,
provide delivery of received messages to the upper layers in the order
they were originally transmitted, provide protection against message
loss, but do not provide protection against message duplication. SRB4 is
used for RRC messages carrying upper layer (NAS) signalling. If these
messages are sensitive to message duplication, the upper layer protocol
should define its own protection mechanism.

7.3 System information broadcasting
-----------------------------------

### 7.3.1 General

The purpose of this procedure is to broadcast SYSTEM INFORMATION (SI)
messages from the GERAN to MSs in a cell.

GERAN is required to broadcast SI messages on BCCH as specified in
3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.018.

### 7.3.2 Broadcast of Iu mode specific System Information

The support of *Iu mode* shall be indicated in SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 3
message sent on BCCH. In addition, the support of *Iu mode* shall be
indicated in either SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPEÂ 4 or SYSTEM INFORMATION
TYPEÂ 7 and 8 messages. The SI3, SI4, SI7 and SI8 messages contain the
CBQ3 parameter that indicates if *Iu mode* is supported in the cell (see
3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.018).

If *Iu mode* is supported and Gb mode is not supported in the cell,
SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPEÂ 13alt message shall be sent and the mobile
station shall read SI13alt message. SI 13 message is not sent in this
case. SI13alt message shall not be sent if *Iu mode* is not supported.

If Gb mode is supported, SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPEÂ 13 message shall be
sent and the mobile station shall read SI 13 message in this case.
SI13alt message is not sent in this case. Additional requirements for
the broadcast of system information in a cell supporting *Iu mode* and
*Gb mode* are specified in 3GPPÂ TSsÂ 44.060 and 44.160.

Figure 7.3.2.1 presents the behaviour of *Iu mode* only capable mobile
station and figure 7.3.2.2 presents the behaviour of *A/Gb mode* and *Iu
mode* capable mobile station on BCCH (see 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.018).

FigureÂ 7.3.2.2: Behaviour of *A/Gb* and *Iu mode*s capable MS on BCCH.

7.4 Paging procedure
--------------------

### 7.4.1 General

The GERAN will start a Paging Request procedure to trigger:

1\> an Initial Direct Transfer procedure for CN originated paging; or

1\> a Cell Update procedure for GERAN initiated paging.

Paging is done by the GERAN on the PCCCH or PACCH (when available) when
the MS is in RRC-Idle mode, RRC-Cell\_Shared state or RRC-GRA\_PCH state
and on SRB2 when the MS is in RRC-Cell\_Dedicated state.

### 7.4.2 Paging initiation in RRC-Idle mode, RRC-Cell\_Shared or RRC-GRA\_PCH state

#### 7.4.2.1 General

The paging initiation in RRC-Idle mode, RRC-Cell\_Shared state or
RRC-GRA\_PCH state is done by sending a PAGING REQUEST service primitive
to the GERAN MAC layer.

![](media/image6.wmf){width="4.977777777777778in"
height="1.5652777777777778in"}

FigureÂ 7.4.2.1.1: Paging Request procedure

This procedure is used to initiate transmission of paging information by
the GERAN MAC to an MS in RRC-Idle mode, RRC-Cell\_Shared state, or
RRC-GRA\_PCH state. Upper layers in the network may request paging, to
e.g. establish a signalling connection between a mobile station and the
CN. The GERAN may initiate paging of an MS in RRC-GRA\_PCH state or
{RRC-Cell\_Shared, MAC-Idle state} to trigger a Cell Update procedure in
order to establish a signalling connection between the network and this
MS.

An MS may use Discontinuous Reception (DRX) to reduce its power
consumption. An MS in non-DRX mode monitors all paging blocks on the
monitored PCCCH. An MS in DRX mode needs only to monitor the blocks
corresponding to its paging group in order to reduce its battery
consumption, see 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.160.

#### 7.4.2.2 Initiation

GERAN RRC initiates the Paging procedure by transmitting a PAGING
REQUEST service primitive to the GERAN MAC sublayer.

The GERAN shall set the IEs in the PAGING service primitive as follows:

1\> if the Paging procedure was initiated by the CN

2\> if the MS is in RRC-Cell\_Shared or RRC-GRA\_PCH state, then

3\> the *MS Identity* IE shall be set to G-RNTI;

### 7.4.3 Paging initiation in RRC-Cell\_Dedicated state

FigureÂ 7.4.3.1.1: Dedicated Paging Request procedure

#### 7.4.3.1 General

This procedure is used to transmit dedicated paging information to one
MS in RRC-Cell\_Dedicated state.

#### 7.4.3.2 Initiation

For an MS in RRC-Cell\_Dedicated state the GERAN initiates the procedure
by transmitting a DEDICATED PAGING REQUEST message on the SRB2 assigned
to the MS. If not stated otherwise, the GERAN may initiate the Dedicated
Paging Request when another RRC procedure is ongoing, and in this case
the state of the latter procedure shall not be affected.

In the DEDICATED PAGING REQUEST message, the GERAN RRC shall set the IE
\"*Paging Cause*\", the IE \"*CN Domain Identity*\", the IE \"*Paging
Record Type Identifier*\" respectively to the Paging Cause, the CN
domain Indicator and the Paging Record Type Identifier received from
upper layers.

If no cause for pagingis received from upper layers, GERAN RRC shall set
the IE \"*Paging Cause*\" to the value \"Terminating -- cause unknown\".

#### 7.4.3.3 Reception of a DEDICATED PAGING REQUEST message by the MS

When the MS receives a DEDICATED PAGING REQUEST message on SRB 2, it
shall not affect the state of any other ongoing RRC procedures, if not
stated otherwise.

Upon receipt of a DEDICATED PAGING REQUEST message the MS shall:

1\> forward the *Paging Cause* IE, the *CN Domain Identity* IE and the
*Paging Record Type Identifier* IE to upper layers;

1\> the procedure ends.

### 7.4.4 Abnormal cases

If the MS receives a DEDICATED PAGING REQUEST message, which contains a
protocol error causing the variable PROTOCOL\_ERROR\_REJECT to be set to
TRUE, the MS shall perform procedure specific error handling as follows:

1\> transmit an RRC STATUS message on the uplink SRB2;

1\> include the IE \"*Identification of Received Message*\";

1\> set the IE \"*Received Message Type*\" to DEDICATED PAGING REQUEST;

1\> include the *Protocol Error Information* IE and set the content to
the value of the variable PROTOCOL\_ERROR\_INFORMATION.

1\> if the RRC STATUS message has been submitted to lower layers for
transmission:

2\> continue with any ongoing processes and procedures as if the invalid
DEDICATED PAGING REQUEST message was not received.

FigureÂ 7.5.2.1: RRC Connection Release procedure

#### 7.5.2.1 General

The purpose of this procedure is to release the RRC connection and all
radio bearers between the MS and the GERAN. By doing so, all established
signalling connections will be released.

#### 7.5.2.2 Initiation

When the MS is in state RRC-Cell\_Dedicated state or RRC-Cell\_Shared
state, the GERAN may at anytime initiate an RRC connection release by
transmitting an RRC CONNECTION RELEASE message using SRB2.

#### 7.5.2.3 Reception of an RRC CONNECTION RELEASE message by the MS

The MS shall receive and act on an RRC CONNECTION RELEASE message in
states RRC-Cell\_Dedicated state and RRC-Cell\_Shared state. Furthermore
this procedure can interrupt any ongoing procedures with the MS in the
above listed states.

When the MS receives the RRC CONNECTION RELEASE message, it shall:

1\> in state RRC-Cell\_Dedicated state:

2\> set the IE \"*RRC Transaction Identifier*\" in the RRC CONNECTION
RELEASE COMPLETE message to the value of \"RRC transaction identifier\"
in the entry for the RRC CONNECTION RELEASE message in the table
\"Accepted transactions\" in the variable TRANSACTIONS; and

2\> if the IE \"*RPLMN Information*\" is present:

3\> the MS may:

4\> store the IE on the ME together with the PLMN id for which it
applies;

3\> the MS may then:

4\> utilise this information, typically indicating where a number of
BCCH frequency ranges of a RAT may be expected to be found, during
subsequent RPLMN selections of the indicated PLMN.

If the RRC CONNECTION RELEASE message contains a protocol error causing
the variable PROTOCOL\_ERROR\_REJECT to be set to TRUE according to
sub-clause 8, and if the \"protocol error cause\" in
PROTOCOL\_ERROR\_INFORMATION is set to any cause value except \"CSN.1
violation or encoding error\", the MS shall perform procedure specific
error handling as follows.

The MS shall:

1\> ignore any IE(s) causing the error but treat the rest of the RRC
CONNECTION RELEASE message as normal according to sub-clause 7.5.2.3,
with an addition of the following actions;

1\> set the IE \"*RRC Transaction Identifier*\" in the RRC CONNECTION
RELEASE COMPLETE message to the value of \"RRC transaction identifier\"
in the entry for the RRC CONNECTION RELEASE message in the table
\"Rejected transactions\" in the variable TRANSACTIONS; and

1\> include the IE \"*Error Indication*\" in the RRC CONNECTION RELEASE
COMPLETE message with:

2\> the IE \"*Failure Cause*\" set to the cause value \"Protocol
error\"; and

2\> the IE \"*Protocol Error Information*\" set to the value of the
variable PROTOCOL\_ERROR\_INFORMATION.

#### 7.5.2.5 Cell re-selection or radio link failure

If the MS performs cell re-selection or the radio link failure criteria
in sub-clause 7.18 is met at any time during the RRC connection release
procedure and the MS has not yet entered idle mode, the MS shall:

1\> if cell re-selection occurred (RRC-Cell\_Shared state):

2\> perform a Cell Update procedure according to sub-clause 7.8 using
the cause \"cell reselection\";

entering RRC-Idle mode from RRC-Connected mode;

2\> and the procedure ends.

#### 7.5.2.6 Reception of an RRC CONNECTION RELEASE COMPLETE message by GERAN

When GERAN receives an RRC CONNECTION RELEASE COMPLETE message from the
MS, it shall:

1\> release all MS dedicated resources and the procedure ends on the
GERAN side.

#### 7.5.2.7 Unsuccessful transmission of the RRC CONNECTION RELEASE COMPLETE message, acknowledged mode transmission

When RLC does not succeed in transmitting the RRC CONNECTION RELEASE
COMPLETE message, the MS shall:

1\> release all its radio resources;

1\> indicate the release of the established signalling connections (as
stored in the variable ESTABLISHED\_SIGNALLING\_CONNECTIONS) and
established radio access bearers (as stored in the variable
ESTABLISHED\_RABS) to upper layers;

entering RRC-Idle mode from RRC-Connected mode;

1\> and the procedure ends.

#### 7.5.2.8 Detection of loss of dedicated physical channel by GERAN in RRC-Cell\_Dedicated state

If the release is performed from the state RRC-Cell\_Dedicated state,
and GERAN detects loss of the dedicated basic physical channel according
to sub-clause 7.18, GERAN may release all MS dedicated resources, even
if no RRC CONNECTION RELEASE COMPLETE message has been received.

#### 7.5.2.9 Failure to receive RRC CONNECTION RELEASE COMPLETE message by GERAN

If GERAN does not receive any RRC CONNECTION RELEASE COMPLETE message,
it shall release all MS dedicated resources.

7.6 Transmission of MS capability information
---------------------------------------------

### 7.6.1 General

FigureÂ 7.6.1.1 : Transmission of MS capability information, normal flow

The MS Capability Update procedure is used by the MS to convey MS
specific capability information to the GERAN.

### 7.6.2 Initiation

The MS shall initiate the MS Capability Update procedure in the
following situations:

1\> the MS receives a MS CAPABILITY ENQUIRY message from the GERAN;

1\> while in RRC-Connected mode the MS capabilities change compared to
those stored in the variable MS\_CAPABILITY\_TRANSFERRED.

If the MS CAPABILITY INFORMATION message is sent in response to a MS
CAPABILITY ENQUIRY message, the MS shall:

1\> include the IE \"*RRC Transaction Identifier*\"; and

1\> set it to the value of \"RRC Transaction Identifier\" in the entry
for the MS CAPABILITY ENQUIRY message in the table \"Accepted
transactions\" in the variable TRANSACTIONS;

1\> retrieve the GERAN *Iu mode* radio access capability information
elements from variable MS\_CAPABILITY\_REQUESTED; and

1\> include this in IE \" *MS* *GERAN Iu mode Radio Access

MS\_CAPABILITY\_REQUESTED.

If the MS CAPABILITY INFORMATION message is sent because one or more of
the MS capabilities change compared to those stored in the variable
MS\_CAPABILITY\_TRANSFERRED while in RRC-Connected mode, the MS shall
include the information elements associated with the capabilities that
have changed in the MS CAPABILITY INFORMATION message.

If the MS is in RRC-GRA\_PCH state, it shall first perform a Cell Update
procedure using the cause \"Uplink Data Transmission\", see sub-clause
7.8.

The MS RRC shall submit the MS CAPABILITY INFORMATION message to the
lower layers for transmission on the uplink using SRB2. The MS RRC
shall:

7.7 MS capability enquiry
-------------------------

### 7.7.1 General

FigureÂ 7.7.1.1: MS Capability Enquiry procedure, normal flow

The MS Capability Enquiry procedure can be used to request the MS to
transmit its capability information related to any radio access network
that is supported by the MS. For a multi-RAT MS this procedure allows in
addition to request UTRAN predefined configuration status informatio.

### 7.7.2 Initiation

The MS Capability Enquiry procedure is initiated by the GERAN by
transmitting a MS CAPABILITY ENQUIRY message using SRB2.

### 7.7.3 Reception of an MS CAPABILITY ENQUIRY message by the MS

Upon reception of an MS CAPABILITY ENQUIRY message, the MS shall act on
the received information elements as specified in sub-clause 7.19 and
7.18 and initiate the transmission of MS Capability Information
procedure, which is specified in sub-clause 7.6.

### 7.7.4 Invalid MS CAPABILITY ENQUIRY message

If the MS receives a MS CAPABILITY ENQUIRY message, which contains a
protocol error causing the variable PROTOCOL\_ERROR\_REJECT to be set to
TRUE according to sub-clause 8, the MS shall perform procedure specific
error handling as follows:

1\> transmit an RRC STATUS message on the uplink using SRB2;

1\> include the IE \"*Identification of Received Message\";* and

1\> set the IE \"*Received Message Type*\" to MS CAPABILITY ENQUIRY; and

1\> set the IE \"*RRC Transaction Identifier*\" to the value of \"RRC
transaction identifier\" in the entry for the MS CAPABILITY ENQUIRY
message in the table \"Rejected transactions\" in the variable
TRANSACTIONS; and

1\> clear that entry;

1\> include the IE \"*Protocol Error Information*\" with contents set to
the value of the variable PROTOCOL\_ERROR\_INFORMATION;

1\> when the RRC STATUS message has been submitted to lower layers for
transmission:

2\> continue with the ongoing processes and procedures as if the invalid
MS CAPABILITY ENQUIRY message has not been received.

FigureÂ 7.8.1.6: GRA Update procedure, basic flow

FigureÂ 7.8.1.7: GRA Update procedure with update of GERAN mobility
information

FigureÂ 7.8.1.8: GRA Update procedure, failure case

#### 7.8.1.1 General

The GRA Update and Cell Update procedures serve several main purposes:

\- to notify GERAN of an RLC unrecoverable error (see 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.160) on
an AM RLC entity;

\- to be used as a supervision mechanism in the RRC-Cell\_Shared state
or RRC-GRA\_PCH state by means of periodical update;

In addition, the GRA Update procedure also serves the following purpose:

\- to retrieve a new GRA identity after cell re-selection to a cell not
belonging to the current GRA assigned to the MS in RRC-GRA\_PCH state;

In addition, the Cell Update procedure also serves the following
purposes:

\- to update GERAN with the current cell the MS is camping on after cell
reselection;

\- to act on a radio link failure or notification of invalid RLC/MAC
control message in the RRC-Cell\_Dedicated state;

\- to act on the transmission failure of the MS CAPABILITY INFORMATION
message;

\- when triggered in the RRC-GRA\_PCH state, to notify GERAN of a
transition to the RRC-Cell\_Shared state due to the reception of GERAN
originated paging or due to a request to transmit uplink data.

The GRA Update and Cell Update procedures may:

\- include an update of mobility related information in the MS;

\- cause a state transition from the RRC-Cell\_Shared state to the
RRC-Cell\_Dedicated state, or from RRC-GRA\_PCH state to RRC-Idle mode.

The Cell Update procedure may also include:

\- a re-establish of layer 2, AM RLC entities;

\- a radio bearer release,or radio bearer reconfiguration;

\- a DBPSCH assignment.

#### 7.8.1.2 Initiation

#### 7.8.1.16 Reception of the GERAN MOBILITY INFORMATION CONFIRM message by the GERAN

See sub-clause 7.8.1.6.

#### 7.8.1.17 Inter-RAT cell reselection to GERAN *Iu mode*

##### 7.8.1.17.1 General

The purpose of the inter-RAT cell reselection procedure to GERAN *Iu
mode* is to transfer, under the control of the MS and to some extent the
source radio access technology, a connection between the MS and another
radio access technology (e.g. UTRAN) to GERAN *Iu mode*.

##### 7.8.1.17.2 Initiation

When the MS makes an inter-RAT cell reselection to GERAN *Iu mode*
according to the criteria specified in 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.160, it shall initiate
this procedure. The inter-RAT cell reselection made by the MS may use
system information broadcast from the source radio access technology or
MS dedicated information.

When the MS performs an inter-RAT cell reselection from a RAT other than
UTRAN, the MS shall:

1\> set the variable ESTABLISHMENT\_CAUSE to \"Inter-RAT cell
reselection\";

1\> initiate an RRC connection establishment procedure as specified in
sub-clause 7.5;

1\> after initiating an RRC connection establishment:

2\> release all resources specific to the other radio access technology.

When the MS performs an inter-RAT cell reselection from UTRAN Cell\_FACH
or Cell\_PCH state to GERAN *Iu mode*, the MS shall:

1\> initiate the cell update procedure as specified in sub-clause 7.8,
using the cause \"cell reselection\"and setting the U-RNTI in the IE
\"*G-RNTI*\".

When the MS performs an inter-RAT cell reselection from UTRAN URA\_PCH,
the MS shall:

1\> compare the URA identity which the MS had been assigned to in UTRAN
against the GRA identities which are broadcast in the GERAN cell.

2\> If the assigned URA identity is not present in the list of GRA
identities that are broadcast in the GERAN cell:

3\> initiate the GRA update procedure as specified for the GRA
reselection case in sub-clause 7.8, using the cause \"change of GRA\"
and setting the U-RNTI in the IE \"*G-RNTI*\".

##### 7.8.1.17.3 MS fails to complete an inter-RAT cell reselection

When the MS performs an inter-RAT cell reselection from a RAT other than
UTRAN, and if the inter-RAT cell reselection fails before the MS has
initiated the RRC connection establishment, the MS may return back to
the other radio access technology.

When the MS performs an inter-RAT cell reselection from a RAT other than
UTRAN, and if the RRC connection establishment fails, the MS shall enter
RRC-Idle mode.

When the MS performs an inter-RAT cell reselection from UTRAN to GERAN
*Iu mode*, and the cell reselection fails, the MS may return back to the
UTRAN RRC Connected state, from which it initiated the inter-RAT cell
reselection.

#### 7.8.1.18 Inter-RAT cell reselection from GERAN Iu mode

##### 7.8.1.18.1 General

The purpose of the inter-RAT cell reselection procedure from GERAN *Iu
mode* is to transfer, under the control of the MS and to some extent the
GERAN, a connection between the MS and GERAN *Iu mode* to another radio
access technology (e.g. UTRAN).

##### 7.8.1.18.2 Initiation

This procedure is applicable in states RRC-Cell\_Shared or RRC GRA\_PCH.

When the MS based on received system information makes a inter-RAT cell
reselection to a radio access technology other than UTRAN, according to
the criteria specified in 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.160, the MS shall:

1\> initiate the establishment of a connection to the target radio
access technology according to its specifications.

When the MS in RRC-Cell\_Shared state performs an inter-RAT cell
reselection to UTRAN, according to the criteria specified in
3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.160, the MS shall:

1\> initiate the cell update procedure according to 3GPPÂ TSÂ 25.331,
using the cause \"cell reselection\"and setting the G-RNTI in the IE
\"*U-RNTI*\". When the MS in RRC-GRA\_PCH state performs an inter-RAT
cell reselection to UTRAN, according to the criteria specified in
3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.160, the MS shall:

1\> compare the GRA identity which the MS had been assigned to in GERAN
against the URA identities which are broadcast in the UTRAN cell.

2\> If the assigned GRA identity is not present in the list of URA
identities that are broadcast in the UTRAN cell:

3\> initiate the URA update procedure as specified in 3GPPÂ TSÂ 25.331,
using the cause \"change of URA\"and setting the G-RNTI in the IE
\"*U-RNTI*\".

##### 7.8.1.18.3 Successful cell reselection

When the MS has succeeded in reselecting a cell in the target radio
access technology other than UTRAN and has initiated the establishment
of a connection, it shall release all GERAN specific resources.

When the MS has succeeded in reselecting to a UTRAN cell, it shall
release all GERAN specific radio resources.

##### 7.8.1.18.4 MS fails to complete an inter-RAT cell reselection

If the inter-RAT cell reselection to another radio access technology
fails, the MS shall resume the connection to GERAN *Iu mode* using the
resources used before initiating the inter-RAT cell reselection
procedure.

### 7.8.2 GRA update

See sub-clause 7.8.1.

### 7.8.3 GERAN mobility information

FigureÂ 7.8.3.1: GERAN Mobility Information procedure, normal flow

FigureÂ 7.8.3.2: GERAN Mobility Information procedure, failure case

#### 7.8.3.1 General

The purpose of this procedure is to allocate any one or a combination of
the following to a MS in Connected Mode:

\- a new G-RNTI;

\- other mobility related information.

#### 7.8.3.2 Initiation

To initiate the procedure GERAN transmits a GERAN MOBILITY INFORMATION
message to the MS on the downlink SRB2.

#### 7.8.3.3 Reception of GERAN MOBILITY INFORMATION message by the MS

When the MS receives a GERAN MOBILITY INFORMATION message, it shall:

1\> act on received information elements as specified in sub-clause
7.19;

1\> if the IE \"*MS Timers and Constants in Connected Mode*\" is
present:

2\> store the values of the IE \"*MS Timers and Constants in Connected
Mode*\" in the variable TIMERS\_AND\_CONSTANTS, replacing any previously
stored value; and

2\> for each updated timer value:

3\> start using the new value next time the timer is started;

NOTE: If a new value of timer T305 is included in the IE \"*MS Timers
and constants in connected mode*\", and the old value of timer T305 is
\"infinity\", the MS will not use the new value of the timer T305 until
the next cell reselection.

1\> set the IE \"RRC Transaction Identifier\" in the GERAN MOBILITY
INFORMATION CONFIRM message to the value of \"RRC transaction
identifier\" in the entry for the GERAN MOBILITY INFORMATION message in
the table \"Accepted transactions\" in the variable TRANSACTIONS; and

1\> clear that entry;

1\> if the GERAN MOBILITY INFORMATION message contained the IE
\"*Ciphering Mode Info*\" or contained the IE \"*Integrity Protection
Mode Info*\":

2\> set the IE \"*Status*\" in the variable SECURITY\_MODIFICATION for
all the CN domains in the variable SECURITY\_MODIFICATION to
\"Affected\";

1\> if the GERAN MOBILITY INFORMATION message contained the IE
\"Ciphering Mode Info\":

Info*\" in the GERAN MOBILITY INFORMATION CONFIRM message and set to the
value of the variable RB\_UPLINK\_CIPHERING\_ACTIVATION\_TIME\_INFO;

1\> if the variable PDCP\_SN\_INFO is non-empty:

2\> include the IE \"*RB with PDCP Information List*\" in the GERAN
MOBILITY INFORMATION CONFIRM message and set it to the value of the
variable PDCP\_SN\_INFO;

1\> if the received GERAN MOBILITY INFORMATION message included the
structure \"Downlink Counter Synchronisation Info\":

2\> if the variable PDCP\_SN\_INFO is empty:

3\> configure the corresponding RLC entity for all AM and UM radio
bearers and AM and UM signalling radio bearers except SRB2 to \"stop\";

2\> else:

3\> configure the RLC entity for signalling radio bearers SRB1, SRB3 and
SRB4 to \"stop\";

3\> configure the RLC entity for UM and AM radio bearers for which the
IE \"*PDCP SN Info*\" is not included to \"stop\";

2\> re-establish SRB2;

2\> for the downlink and the uplink, apply the ciphering configuration
as follows:

3\> if the received re-configuation message included the IE \"*Ciphering
Mode Info*\":

4\> use the ciphering configuration in the received message when
transmitting the response message;

3\> if the ciphering configuration for SRB2 from a previously received
SECURITY MODE COMMAND has not yet been applied because of the activation
times not having been reached:

4\> if the previous SECURITY MODE COMMAND was received due to new keys
being received:

5\> consider the new ciphering configuration to include the received new
keys;

5\> initialise the HFN component of the uplink COUNT-C and downlink
COUNT-C of SRB2 as indicated in subclause 7.16.1.2.3.1.

4\> if the ciphering configuration for SRB2 from a previously received
SECURITY MODE COMMAND has not yet been applied because of the
corresponding activation times not having been reached and the previous
SECURITY MODE COMMAND caused a change in LATEST\_CONFIGURED\_CN\_DOMAIN:

5\> initialise the HFN component of the uplink COUNT-C and downlink
COUNT-C of SRB2 to the most recently transmitted IE \"*START List*\" or
IE \"*START*\" for the LATEST\_CONFIGURED\_CN\_DOMAIN at the reception
of the previous SECURITY MODE COMMAND message.

5\> consider the new ciphering configuration to include the keys
associated with the LATEST\_CONFIGURED\_CN\_DOMAIN;

4\> apply the new ciphering configuration immediately following RLC
re-establishment.

3\> else:

4\> continue using the current ciphering configuration;

2\> set the new uplink and downlink HFN of SRB2 to MAX (uplink HFN of
SRB2, downlink HFN of SRB2) + 1;

2\> increment by one the downlink and uplink HFN values for SRB2;

2\> calculate the START value according to sub-clause 7.18;

2\> include the calculated START values for each CN domain in the IE
\"START List\" in the structure \"Uplink Counter Synchronisation Info\"
in the GERAN MOBILITY INFORMATION CONFIRM message;

1\> transmit a GERAN MOBILITY INFORMATION CONFIRM message on the uplink
SRB2;

1\> if the IE \"*Integrity Protection Mode Info*\" was present in the
GERAN MOBILITY INFORMATION message:

2\> start applying the new integrity protection configuration in the
uplink for signalling radio bearer SRB2 from and including the
transmitted GERAN MOBILITY INFORMATION CONFIRM message;

1\> if the structure \"*Downlink Counter Synchronisation Info*\" was
included in the received GERAN MOBILITY INFORMATION message:

2\> when RLC has confirmed the successful transmission of the response
message:

3\> if the variable PDCP\_SN\_INFO is empty:

4\> configure the RLC entity for all AM and UM radio bearers and AM and
UM signalling radio bearers except SRB2 to \"continue\";

3\> else:

### 7.8.4 Inter-mode handover from GERAN Iu mode

#### 7.8.4.1 General

FigureÂ 7.8.4.1.1: Inter-mode handover from GERAN, successful case

FigureÂ 7.8.4.1.2: Inter-mode handover from GERAN Iu mode, failure case

The purpose of the Inter-Mode Handover from GERAN Iu procedure is to,
under the control of the network, transfer a connection between the MS
and GERAN *Iu mode* to GERAN *A/Gb mode*.This procedure may be used to
request an intercell or intracell change of channel(s) by the network,
in RRC-Cell\_Dedicated state.

NOTE: This procedure is applicable to CS domain service.

#### 7.8.4.2 Initiation

The procedure is initiated when GERAN *Iu mode* orders a MS in
RRC-Cell\_Dedicated state, to make a handover to GERAN *A/Gb mode*.

To initiate the procedure, GERAN sends a HANDOVER FROM GERAN Iu COMMAND
message.

Upon the receipt of HANDOVER FROM GERAN Iu COMMAND message, the mobile
station shall:

1\> initiate reconfiguration of the layer 2 and disconnection of the
DBPSCHs;

1\> switch to the assigned cell(s) and establish the physical channels
as described in 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.018.

#### 7.8.4.3 Reception of a HANDOVER FROM GERAN Iu COMMAND message by the MS

The MS shall be able to receive a HANDOVER FROM GERAN Iu COMMAND message
and perform an inter-mode handover, even if no prior MS measurements
have been performed on the target cell. The connection is established in
GERAN *A/Gb mode* by using the contents of encapsulated message HANDOVER
COMMAND message (see 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.018)

If the IE \"*RAB information List*\" is included in the HANDOVER FROM
GERAN Iu COMMAND message:

1\> if the IE \"RAB information List\" includes one IE \"RAB Info\" with
the IE \"*CN domain Identity*\" set to \"CS domain\":

2\> connect upper layer entities corresponding to the indicated CS
domain RAB to the radio resources indicated in the encapsulated HANDOVER
COMMAND message.

2\> and act upon received information element as specified
3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.018.

NOTE: In this version of the specification the maximum number of CS
domain RABs which may be included in the IE \"RAB information List\" is
limited to 1.

#### 7.8.4.4 Successful completion of the inter-mode handover

Upon successfully completing the handover, GERAN shall:

1\> release the radio connection;

Upon successfully completing the handover, the MS shall:

1\> if inter-mode handover is performed and if there are any NAS
messages with the IE \"*CN domain identity*\" set to \"CS domain\" for
which the successful delivery of the INITIAL DIRECT TRANSFER message or
UPLINK DIRECT TRANSFER message on signalling radio bearer SRB3 or
signalling radio bearer SRB4 has not yet been confirmed by RLC:

2\> retransmit those NAS messages to the network on the newly
established radio connection to the system.

3\> clear or set variables upon leaving GERAN RRC-Connected mode as
specified in sub-clauses 7.19 and 10.4.

#### 7.8.4.5 Unsuccesful completion of the inter-mode handover at the MS side

If the MS does not succeed in establishing the connection to the target,
it shall:

1\> revert back to the GERAN configuration;

1\> establish the GERAN physical channel(s) used at the time for
reception of HANDOVER FROM GERAN Iu COMMAND;

1\> if the MS does not succeed to establish the GERAN physical
channel(s):

2\> select a suitable GERAN cell according to 3GPPÂ TSÂ 45.008.

2\> perform a Cell Update procedure according to sub-clause 7.8 with
cause \"radio link failure\";

2\> when the Cell Update procedure has completed successfully:

3\> proceed as below;

1\> transmit the HANDOVER FAILURE message setting the information
elements as specified below:

2\> include the IE \"RRC Transaction Identifier\"; and

2\> set it to the value of \"RRC Transaction Identifier\" in the entry
for the HANDOVER FROM GERAN Iu COMMAND message in the table \"Accepted
transactions\" in the variable TRANSACTIONS; and

2\> clear that entry;

2\> set the IE \"Failure Cause\" to \"physical channel failure\";

1\> when the HANDOVER FAILURE message has been submitted to lower layer
for transmission:

2\> the procedure ends.

#### 7.8.4.6 Invalid HANDOVER FROM GERAN Iu COMMAND message

If the received HANDOVER FROM GERAN Iu COMMAND message does not include
a valid encapsulated HANDOVER COMMAND message (see 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.018), the
MS shall perform procedure specific error handling as follows. The MS
shall:

1\> set the IE \"*Failure Cause*\" to the cause value \"Inter-mode
Protocol Error\";

1\> transmit a HANDOVER FAILURE message on the uplink SRB2;

1\> when the transmission of the HANDOVER FAILURE message has been
confirmed by RLC:

2\> continue with any ongoing processes and procedures as if the invalid
HANDOVER FROM GERAN Iu COMMAND message has not been received;

2\> and the procedure ends.

If the HANDOVER FROM GERAN Iu COMMAND message contains a protocol error
causing the variable PROTOCOL\_ERROR\_REJECT to be set to TRUE according
to sub-clause 8, the MS shall perform procedure specific error handling
as follows. The MS shall:

1\> set the IE \"*RRC Transaction Identifier*\" in the HANDOVER FAILURE
message to the value of \"RRC transaction identifier\" in the entry for
the HANDOVER FROM GERAN Iu COMMAND message in the table \"Rejected
transactions\" in the variable TRANSACTIONS; and

1\> clear that entry;

1\> set the IE \"Failure Cause\" to the cause value \"protocol error\";

1\> include the IE \"Protocol Error Information\" with contents set to
the value of the variable PROTOCOL\_ERROR\_INFORMATION;

1\> transmit a HANDOVER FAILURE message on the uplink SRB2;

1\> when the HANDOVER FAILURE message has been submitted to lower layers
for transmission:

2\> continue with any ongoing processes and procedures as if the invalid
HANDOVER FROM GERAN Iu COMMAND message has not been received;

2\> and the procedure ends.

#### 7.8.4.7 Reception of an HANDOVER FAILURE message by GERAN in Iu mode

Upon receiving an HANDOVER FAILURE message, GERAN may initiate the
release of the resources in the GERAN A/Gb mode (see 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.018 and
3GPPÂ TSÂ 25.413).

#### 7.8.4.8 Unsupported configuration in HANDOVER FROM GERAN Iu COMMAND message

If:

\- the GERAN instructs the MS to perform a non-supported handover
scenario; or

\- the GERAN instructs the MS to use a non-supported configuration; or

\- the IE \"*RAB Information List*\" is included in the HANDOVER FROM
GERAN Iu mode COMMAND message and this IE does not include any IE \"RAB
Info\" with the IE \"CN domain Identity\" set to \"CS domain\":

the MS shall:

1\> transmit a HANDOVER FAILURE message, setting the information
elements as specified below:

2\> include the IE \"RRC Transaction Identifier\"; and

2\> set it to the value of \"RRC Transaction Identifier\" in the entry
for the HANDOVER FROM GERAN Iu COMMAND message in the table \"Accepted
transactions\" in the variable TRANSACTIONS; and

2\> clear that entry;

2\> set the IE \"Failure Cause\" to \"configuration unsupported\";

2\> when the HANDOVER FAILURE message has been submitted to lower layers
for transmission:

3\> resume normal operation as if the invalid HANDOVER FROM GERAN Iu
COMMAND message has not been received;

3\> and the procedure ends.

#### 7.8.4.9 Reception of HANDOVER FROM GERAN Iu COMMAND message by MS in RRC-Cell\_Shared state

If the MS receives HANDOVER FROM GERAN Iu COMMAND while in
RRC-Cell\_Shared state, the MS shall:

1\> transmit a HANDOVER FAILURE message, setting the information
elements as specified below:

2\> include the IE \"RRC Transaction Identifier\"; and

2\> set it to the value of \"RRC Transaction Identifier\" in the entry
for the HANDOVER FROM GERAN Iu COMMAND message in the table \"Accepted
transactions\" in the variable TRANSACTIONS; and

2\> clear that entry;

2\> set the IE \"Failure Cause\" to \"protocol error\";

3\> include IE \"Protocol Error Information\";

3\> set the value of IE \"Protocol Error Cause\" to \"Message not
compatible with receiver state\"; and

for transmission:

3\> resume normal operation as if the invalid HANDOVER FROM GERAN Iu
COMMAND message has not been received;

3\> and the procedure ends.

7.9 Procedures for System Information transmission and Measurement reporting in RRC-Cell\_Dedicated state
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE: Any modification to this sub-clause may have impact on
3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.018.

### 7.9.1 General

In RRC-Cell\_Dedicated state, the mobile station sends measurement
report messages and receives system information on SRB1.

In the uplink direction, measurement report messages are sent using SRB1
at each possible occasion when no other RRC message has to be sent (see
sub-clause 7.9.2). Similarly, in the downlink direction, SYSTEM
INFORMATION TYPE 5, 6 and optionally 5bis and 5ter messages are sent on
SRB1 when no other RRC message has to be sent. The network may, in
addition, send MEASUREMENT INFORMATION messages on SRB1 to a mobile
station in RRC-Cell\_Dedicated state. This message may order the MS to
use the enhanced measurement reporting. The mapping of SRB1 onto logical
channels is specified in 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.160.

A mobile station with extended measurement capabilities, which receives
EXTENDED MEASUREMENT ORDER messages on SRB1, shall perform and report
extended measurements, see sub-clause 7.9.3.

The SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 5bis message shall be sent if and only if
the EXT IND bit in the *Neighbour Cell Description* information element
in both the SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 5 and TYPE 5bis messages indicates
that each information element only carries part of the BA.

A GSMÂ 900 mobile station which only supports the primary GSMÂ band
P-GSMÂ 900 (cf. 3GPPÂ TSÂ 45.005) may consider the EXT-IND bit in the
*Neighbour Cell Description* IE in the SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 5 message
bit as a spare bit, assume that the information element carries the
complete BA, and ignore any SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 5bis messages.

NOTE: The network should take into account limitations of certain mobile
stations to understand SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 5ter and TYPE 5bis
messages, the EXT-IND bit in the *Neighbour Cell Description* IE, and
formats used in the *Neighbour Cell Description* information element and
*Cell Channel Description* information element used in system
information messages, see 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.018.

Problems occurring in the reception of SACCH frames are interpreted as a
loss of communication means and appropriate procedures are then
triggered as specified in 3GPPÂ TSÂ 45.008.

### 7.9.2 Measurement Report and Enhanced Measurement Report

#### 7.9.2.2 Parameters for Measurements and Reporting

##### 7.9.2.2.1 General

Some parameters from the MEASUREMENT INFORMATION or PSI3quater messages
allow an MS to build lists which are used for Measurement reporting and
Enhanced Measurement reporting.

Full sets of MEASUREMENT INFORMATION messages and PSI3quater messages
are defined by a number of different instances indicated respectively by
the parameters MI\_COUNT and **PSI3\_QUATER\_COUNT**. Two different
instances of MEASUREMENT INFORMATION) messages and PSI3quater messages
are respectively distinguished by different MI\_INDEX and
**PSI3\_QUATER\_INDEX** parameter values.

If the MP\_CHANGE\_MARK parameter or the PSI3\_CHANGE\_MARK parameter is
changed, the MS shall re-read the Real Time differences, REP\_PRIORITY,
CCN\_SUPPORTED, Measurement Parameters and 3GÂ Measurement Parameters in
all instances of respectively MEASUREMENT INFORMATION messages or
PSI3quater messages. The MS shall start using the parameters as soon as
they have been received. In the case that not all the parameters have
been received in a full set of instances, then the default values shall
be used. If different values occur for the same parameter in different
instances of a MEASUREMENT INFORMATION message or PSI3quater message,
the instance with the highest index shall be used.

##### 7.9.2.2.2 Deriving the 3GÂ Neighbour Cell list from the 3GÂ Neighbour Cell Description

A multi-RAT MS shall form a 3GÂ Neighbour Cell list.

In RRC-Idle mode, the MS obtains the 3G Neighbour Cell Description
information on PBCCH by one or more instances of the PSI3quater message
as specified in 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.160 sub-clause 5.5.3. When the
PSI3\_CHANGE\_MARK parameter is changed in a PSI3quater message, the MS
shall re-read all instances and rebuild the 3GÂ Neighbour Cell list. This
3G neighbour cell list shall then be used for measurement reporting when
the MS enters RRC-Cell\_Dedicated state, until the MS has received a
given number of instances of MEASUREMENT INFORMATION messages that
contain 3GÂ Neighbour Cell Description. This number of instances is
defined by the 3G-WAIT parameter.

In RRC-Cell\_Dedicated state, the MS obtains the 3G Neighbour Cell
Description information on SRB1 by one or more instances of the
MEASUREMENT INFORMATION message with the same 3G\_BA\_INDÂ value as
defined in this sub-clause. When the 3G\_BA\_IND parameter in the
MEASUREMENT INFORMATION message is changed, the MS shall also re-read
all instances of MEASUREMENT INFORMATION messages, rebuild the
3GÂ Neighbour Cell list, and use the new list for measurement reporting
based on the parameter 3G-WAIT.

The 3GÂ Neighbour Cell list may contain up to 96 3GÂ Neighbour Cells.

Each *3GÂ Neighbour Cell Description* received is added to the
3GÂ Neighbour Cell list, starting with the index equal to the parameter
Index\_Start\_3G. If this parameter is not present then the value 0
shall be used.

For each 3GÂ Neighbour Cell Description, the cells are indexed in the
following order:

1\) UTRAN FDD cells: FDD ARFCNs are indexed in the order of occurrence
in the 3GÂ Neighbour Cell description. Then for each FDD ARFCN, the cells
are indexed in the order of increasing values of the decoded
FDD\_CELL\_INFORMATION parameters.

2\) UTRAN TDD cells: TDD ARFCNs are indexed in the order of occurrence
in the 3GÂ Neighbour Cell description. Then for each TDD ARFCN, the cells
are indexed in the order of increasing values of the decoded
TDD\_CELL\_INFORMATION parameters.

3\) CDMA 2000 cells: the cells are indexed in the order of occurrence in
the 3GÂ Neighbour Cell description.

If a *3GÂ Neighbour Cell Description* includes non-supported frequencies
or Radio Access Technologies, this shall not be considered as an error;
indices in the 3GÂ Neighbour Cell list shall be incremented accordingly.

If more than one cell with the same index in the 3G Neighbour Cell list
are provided by different instances of *3G Neighbour Cell Descriptions*,
the cell from the message instance with the highest index shall be used.
In case the same 3GÂ Cell occurs more than once in the resulting
3GÂ Neighbour Cell list, each occurrence shall be assigned an index but
only the cell with the highest index in the 3G Neighbour Cell list shall
be referred to in measurement reports.

If a cell is provided for an index higher than 95 in the 3G Neighbour
Cell list, this shall not be considered as an error; the cell shall not
be included in the 3G Neighbour Cell list.

##### 7.9.2.2.3 Deriving the GSM Neighbour Cell list from the BSICs and the BCCH Allocation

In RRC-Idle mode, the MS shall derive the GSM Neighbour Cell from
information received on PBCCH, by one or more instances of the PSI3 or
PSI3bis message as specified in 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.160. In RRC-Cell\_Dedicated
state, the GSM Neighbour Cell list shall be derived from information
received, on SRB1, by one or more instances of the MEASUREMENT
INFORMATION message as defined in this sub-clause. The GSM Neighbour
Cell list may contain up to 96 Neighbour Cells.

To obtain the GSM neighbour cell list, the MS shall combine the BA
(list) received in SI5/SI5bis/SI5ter with the BSIC list received in one
or more instances of the MEASUREMENT INFORMATION message with the same
BA\_IND value as the BA (list). The BSICs may be received before the
corresponding BA (list). The first BSIC in each instance applies to the
frequency in the BA (list) referenced by the parameter
BA\_Index\_Start\_BSIC. For each successive BSIC, one bit indicates if
the BSIC applies to the same frequency as the previous BSIC or to the
next frequency in the BA (list), as defined in 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.018. When the
BA\_IND is changed the MS shall rebuild the combined list and the BSIC
list shall also be rebuilt.

##### 7.9.2.2.4 Deriving the Neighbour Cell list from the GSM Neighbour Cell list and the 3GÂ Neighbour Cell list

For report with the ENHANCED MEASUREMENT REPORT message, the Neighbour
Cell list is the concatenation of the GSM Neighbour Cell list and the
3GÂ Neighbour Cell list (if any). In this concatenation the value of the
parameter Absolute\_Index\_Start\_EMR is added to the 3GÂ Neighbour Cell
list indices. The Neighbour Cell list may contain up to 96 Neighbour
Cells. If the same index occurs for a GSM Cell and a 3GÂ Cell, the GSM
Cell shall be used.

NOTE: For report with the MEASUREMENT REPORT message, the concatenated
list is not used. Instead, the two lists are used separately, as defined
in 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.018.

##### 7.9.2.2.5 Real Time Differences

To obtain the Real Time Differences, the MS shall combine the BA (list)
with the Real Time Differences parameters received in the MEASUREMENT
INFORMATION message with the same BA\_IND value as the BA (list). The
Real Time Difference list may contain up to 96 Real Time Difference
parameters. Each frequency in the BA (list) may be associated to 0, 1 or
more Real Time Difference parameters. The Real Time Difference
parameters may be received before the corresponding BA (list). The
parameter BA\_Index\_Start\_RTD in each structure indicates the index of
the frequency in the BA (list) to be taken as a starting reference. A
sub-structure is included for each frequency referenced. Each of those
sub-structures indicates if 0, 1 or more RTD parameters are present for
this frequency. If a frequency in the BA (list) is not provided with
Real Time Difference information by any of the message instances with
correct BA\_IND, it shall be assumed that no information is available
for that frequency, see 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.018. When the BA\_IND is changed the
MS shall re-read the Real Time Differences parameters in all instances.

The Real Time Difference may be received from the PSI3ter message in the
GPRS Real Time Difference Description (see 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.160).

##### 7.9.2.2.6 Report Priority Description

Report Priority information can be received in one instance of the
MEASUREMENT INFORMATION message. The Report Priority information is
associated with the Neighbour Cell list (see 7.9.2.2.4) having the same
BA\_IND value and 3G\_BA\_IND value. Each REP\_PRIORITY bit of this
field relates to indices of the Neighbour Cell list, starting with index
0. The Report Priority information may be received before the
corresponding Neighbour Cell list. When the BA\_IND or 3G\_BA\_IND are
changed the MS shall re-read the REP\_PRIORITY parameters in all
instances.

Indices exceeding the value 95 shall be ignored. If there are fewer
indices than the number of Neighbour Cells, the value 0 shall be assumed
for the missing bits.

Report Priority Description for GSM cells may also be received from the
PSI3ter message and Report Priority Description for 3G cells from the
PSI3quarter message(see 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.160).

##### 7.9.2.2.7 The 3GÂ Cell Reselection list

This applies only to a multi-RAT MS. The 3G Cell Reselection list is
defined in 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.160.

##### 7.9.2.2.8 CCN Support description

The CCN Support description may be received from the PSI3 message or any
instance of the PSI3bis or PSI3quater messages(see 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.160).

### 7.9.3 Extended measurement report

Only applicable to mobile stations which support extended measurement.

When in RRC-Cell\_Dedicated state, a mobile station may receive an
EXTENDED MEASUREMENT ORDER message from the network. As defined in
3GPPÂ TSÂ 45.008, the mobile station shall then perform measurements on
the frequencies specified by this EXTENDED MEASUREMENT ORDER message for
one reporting period. The mobile station shall thereafter send an
EXTENDED MEASUREMENT REPORT message. This message contains the
measurement results as defined in 3GPPÂ TSÂ 45.008.

If the mobile station has not started to send its EXTENDED MEASUREMENT
REPORT message within 10 seconds after the reception of the EXTENDED
MEASUREMENT ORDER message, no EXTENDED MEASUREMENT REPORT message shall
be sent. The mobile station shall after a successful channel change
abort any pending measurements or reporting related to an EXTENDED
MEASUREMENT ORDER message received on the old channel.

If a mobile station receives an EXTENDED MEASUREMENT ORDER message
indicating the same value of the sequence code as an EXTENDED
MEASUREMENT ORDER message received earlier on the same channel without
having received any EXTENDED MEASUREMENT ORDER message indicating a
different value of the sequence code in between, that EXTENDED
MEASUREMENT ORDER message shall be ignored. If the mobile station,
before the reporting related to an EXTENDED MEASUREMENT ORDER message
has started, receives a new EXTENDED MEASUREMENT ORDER message with a
different value of the sequence code, any pending measurements or
reporting related to the earlier EXTENDED MEASUREMENT ORDER message
shall be aborted and the new message treated.

The EXTENDED MEASUREMENT ORDER message and the EXTENDED MEASUREMENT
REPORT message are sent on SRB1.

7.10 Handover to UTRAN procedure
--------------------------------

### 7.10.1 General

This procedure is only valid for UTRAN capable MSs. A change to UTRAN
channel(s) can be requested by the network RRC sublayer in
RRC-Cell\_Dedicated state.

The handover to UTRAN procedure includes:

1\> the reconfiguration of the layer 2 established for the DBPSCHs;

1\> the disconnection and the deactivation of physical channels and
their release (layer 1).

1\> the establishment of UTRAN channel(s), see 3GPPÂ TSÂ 25.331.

### 7.10.2 Initiation

The network initiates the handover to UTRAN procedure by sending an
INTER SYSTEM TO UTRAN HANDOVER COMMAND message to the mobile station on
the SRB2 in GERAN in *Iu mode*. The INTER SYSTEM TO UTRAN HANDOVER
COMMAND message shall contain encapsulated the RADIO BEARER
RECONFIGURATION message. If the INTER SYSTEM TO UTRAN HANDOVER COMMAND
refers to a not known cell (see 3GPPÂ TSÂ 25.133 and 3GPPÂ TSÂ 25.123), this
shall not be considered as an error.

### 7.10.3 Reception of INTER SYSTEM TO UTRAN HANDOVER COMMAND message by the MS

Upon the receipt of INTER SYSTEM TO UTRAN HANDOVER COMMAND message, the
mobile station shall:

1\> initiate reconfiguration of the layer 2 and disconnection of the
DBPSCHs;

1\> switch to the assigned cell(s) and establish the physical channels
as described in 3GPPÂ TSÂ 25.331.

1\> establish the connection to the UTRA cell, by using the contents of
encapsulated RADIO BEARER RECONFIGURATION message.

### 7.10.4 Successful completion of the inter-RAT handover

When inter-RAT handover to UTRAN is performed, the MS shall:

1\> perform the actions on reception of RADIO BEARER RECONFIGURATION
message as specified in 3GPPÂ TSÂ 25.331;

1\> keep the ciphering and integrity keys that are stored in the
USIM/SIM for that CN domain.

1\> if inter-RAT handover to UTRAN is performed and if there are any NAS
messages for which the successful delivery of the INITIAL DIRECT
TRANSFER message or UPLINK DIRECT TRANSFER message on signalling radio
bearer SRB3 or signalling radio bearer SRB4 has not yet been confirmed
by RLC:

2\> retransmit those NAS messages to the network on the newly
established radio connection to the target radio access technology.

1\> clear or set variables upon leaving GERAN RRC connected mode as
specified in sub-clause 10.4.

After lower layer connections are successfully established, the mobile
station returns a RADIO BEARER RECONFIGURATION COMPLETE message on UTRAN
channels(s), see 3GPPÂ TSÂ 25.331.

When receiving the RADIO BEARER RECONFIGURATION COMPLETE message (see
3GPPÂ TSÂ 25.331), the network shall release the old channels (see
3GPPÂ TSÂ 25.413).

### 7.10.5 Unsuccesful inter-rat handover at the MS side

If the MS does not succeed in establishing the connection to the UTRA
cell, it shall:

1\> revert back to the old configuration;

1\> establish the GERAN physical channel(s) used at the time of
reception of the INTERSYSTEM HANDOVER TO UTRAN COMMAND message;

1\> if the lower layer failure happens while attempting to connect back
to the old channels;

2\> the PROTOCOL\_ERROR\_REJECT variable is set TRUE;

1\> if the MS does not succeed to establish the GERAN physical
channel(s):

2\> perform a Cell Update procedure according to sub-clause 7.8 with
cause \"radio link failure\";

2\> when the Cell Update procedure has been completed successfully:

3\> proceed as below.

1\> transmit the HANDOVER FAILURE message setting the information
elements as specified below:

2\> include the IE \"*RRC Transaction Identifier*\"; and

2\> set it to the value of \"RRC transaction identifier\" in the entry
for the INTER SYSTEM HANDOVER TO UTRAN COMMAND message in the table
\"Accepted transactions\" in the variable TRANSACTIONS; and

2\> clear that entry;

2\> set the IE \"*Failure Cause*\" to \"physical channel failure\".

2\> when the HANDOVER FAILURE message has been submitted to lower layer
for transmission the procedure ends.

If the INTER SYSTEM TO UTRAN HANDOVER COMMAND instructs the mobile to
use a predefined configuration not implemented or if the INTER SYSTEM TO
UTRAN HANDOVER COMMAND instructs the mobile to use a default
configuration not supported by the MS, the MS shall:

1\> set the variable PROTOCOL\_ERROR\_REJECT to TRUE; and

1\> if allowed by the source RAT:

2\> include the IE \"*Protocol Error Information*\" with contents set to
the value of the variable PROTOCOL\_ERROR\_INFORMATION;

1\> then stay on the current channel(s) and return a HANDOVER FAILURE
message on SRB2 with cause \"UTRAN configuration unknown\";

> 1\> clear all the UTRAN predefined configurations.

When sending a HANDOVER FAILURE message in response to an INTERSYSTEM TO
UTRAN HANDOVER COMMAND message, the mobile station shall erase all the
UTRAN predefined configurations.

If the INTER SYSTEM TO UTRAN HANDOVER COMMAND message instructs the
mobile station to use a frequency that it is not capable of, then the
mobile station shall:

1\> stay on the current channel(s) and return a HANDOVER FAILURE message
on SRB2 with cause \"frequency not implemented\".

### 7.10.6 Reception of an HANDOVER FAILURE message by GERAN in Iu mode

When HANDOVER FAILURE has been received, the network shall

1\> release the UTRAN channel(s), if they were dedicated channels;

1\> if a HANDOVER FAILURE message is received on the old channels on
SRB2; or

1\> if the GERAN has received CELL UPDATE message with the cause \"Radio
link failure\" then:

2\> the old channels shall be released if they were DBPSCHs and all
contexts related to the connections with that mobile station are
cleared.

7.11 Handover to CDMA2000 procedure
-----------------------------------

### 7.11.1 General

This procedure is only valid for CDMA2000 capable MSs. A change to
CDMA2000 channel(s) can be requested by the network RRC sublayer in
RRC-Cell\_Dedicated state.

The handover to CDMA2000 procedure includes:

\- the disconnection and the deactivation of physical channels and their
release (layer 1).

\- the establishment of CDMA2000 channel(s), see TIA/EIA/IS-833 and
TIA/EIA/IS-2000-5.

### 7.11.2 Initiation

The network initiates the handover to CDMA2000 procedure by sending an
INTER SYSTEM TO CDMA2000 HANDOVER COMMAND message to the mobile station
on the SRB2 in GERAN in *Iu mode*. The INTER SYSTEM TO CDMA2000 HANDOVER
COMMAND message shall contain encapsulated the HANDOVER TO CDMA2000
COMMAND. If the INTER SYSTEM TO CDMA2000 HANDOVER COMMAND refers to a
not known base station (see TIA/EIA/IS-98), this shall not be considered
as an error.

### 7.11.3 Reception of INTERSYSTEM TO CDMA2000 HANDOVER COMMAND message by the MS

Upon the receipt of INTER SYSTEM TO CDMA2000 HANDOVER COMMAND message,
the mobile station shall:

1\> switch to the assigned cell(s) and establish the physical channels
as described in TIA/EIA/IS-833 and TIA/EIA/IS-2000-5.

1\> establish the connection to the CDMA cell, by using the contents of
encapsulated message HANDOVER TO CDMA2000 COMMAND.

1\> in case one or more IEs \"*RAB Info*\" is included in the INTER
SYSTEM TO CDMA2000 HANDOVER COMMAND message:

2\> connect upper layer entities corresponding to indicated RABs to the
radio resources indicated in the inter-RAT message.

2\> and act upon received information element as specified in
sub-clauses 7.18 and 7.19.

### 7.11.4 Successful completion of the inter-RAT handover

NOTE: After lower layer connections are successfully established, the
mobile station returns a Handoff Completion message on CDMA2000
channels(s), see TIA/EIA/IS-833.

When receiving the Handoff Completion message (see TIA/EIA/IS-833 and
3GPPÂ TSÂ 25.413), the network shall release the old channels.

### 7.11.5 Unsuccesful inter-rat handover at the MS side

If the MS does not succeed in establishing the connection to the
CDMA2000 cell (see TIA/EIA/IS-2000-5), it shall:

> 1\> revert back to the old configuration;
>
> 1\> establish the GERAN physical channel(s) used at the time of
> reception of the INTER SYSTEM HANDOVER TO CDMA2000 COMMAND;

1\> if the lower layer failure happens while attempting to connect back
to the old channels;

2\> the PROTOCOL\_ERROR\_REJECT variable is set TRUE;

1\> if the MS does not succeed to establish the GERAN physical
channel(s):

> 2\> perform a Cell Update procedure according to sub-clause 7.8 with
> cause \"radio link failure\";
>
> 2\> when the Cell Update procedure has been completed successfully:

3\> proceed as below.

1\> transmit the HANDOVER FAILURE message setting the information
elements as specified below:

2\> include the IE \"*RRC Transaction Identifier*\"; and

2\> set it to the value of \"RRC transaction identifier\" in the entry
for the INTER SYSTEM HANDOVER TO CDMA2000 COMMAND message in the table
\"Accepted transactions\" in the variable TRANSACTIONS; and

2\> clear that entry;

2\> set the IE \"*Failure Cause*\" to \"physical channel failure\".

1\> when the HANDOVER FAILURE message has been submitted to lower layer
for transmission the procedure ends.

If the INTER SYSTEM TO CDMA2000 HANDOVER COMMAND message instructs the
mobile station to use a frequency that it is not capable of, then the
mobile station shall:

1\> stay on the current channel(s) and return a HANDOVER FAILURE message
on SRB2 with cause \"frequency not implemented\".

### 7.11.6 Reception of an HANDOVER FAILURE message by GERAN in Iu mode

When HANDOVER FAILURE has been received, the network shall

1\> release the CDMA2000 channel(s);

1\> if a HANDOVER FAILURE message is received on the old channels on
SRB2; or

1\> the mobile station has received CELL UPDATE with the cause \"radio
link failure\" then:

2\> the old channels shall be released and all contexts related to the
connections with that mobile station are cleared.

7.12 Mapping of user data substreams onto timeslots in a multislot configuration
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For multislot configurations the following rules for mapping of the user
data substreams onto timeslots shall apply for each channel set:

1\> at initial assignment, the lowest numbered user data substream shall
be mapped to the lowest numbered timeslot etc. in ascending order (the
user data substreams are numbered 0 to (n-1), where n is the number of
substreams)

1\> at channel changes using handover procedure or radio bearer
procedures, the lowest numbered user data substream shall be mapped to
the lowest numbered timeslot etc. in ascending order (the user data
substreams are numbered 0 to (n-1), where n is the number of substreams)

1\> at channel changes using radio bearer procedures:

2\> user data substream(s) mapped to timeslot(s) that are present in
both the old and the new configuration shall continue to be mapped to
the same timeslot(s) as before the channel change; and

2\> possibly added timeslot(s) shall carry the lowest numbered available
user data substream so that the lowest numbered data substream among the
added is mapped to the lowest numbered added timeslot and so on in
ascending order.

NOTE: The user data substream number is a number that need not be the
same as the inband number used for transparent services. The user data
substream number is only used as a point of reference to a specific user
data substream.

7.13 Application Procedures
---------------------------

### 7.13.1 LCS transfer

FigureÂ 7.13.1.1:Â LCS transfer

#### 7.13.1.1 General

The LCS Transfer procedure enables the SMLC on the network side and the
MS to exchange RRLP Protocol Data Units (PDUs). Only the GERAN may
initiate the exchange of RRLP PDU\'s (initiated by the SMLC). The MS
only sends RRLP PDU\'s in the uplink direction in response to RRLP
PDU\'s sent by the GERAN (SMLC).

The maximum size of the RRLP PDU in the LCS DOWNLINK INFORMATION and LCS
UPLINK INFORMATION messages is 242 octets. Since RRLP pseudo
segmentation limits the length of RRLP PDUs, segmentation is not defined
for the LCS Transfer procedure.

#### 7.13.1.2 Intiation of LCS transfer procedure in the GERAN

In the GERAN, the LCS transfer procedure is initiated when the the SMLC
requests the transfer of an RRLP PDU after the initial signaling
connection is established. The GERAN may also initiate the LCS transfer
procedure when another RRC procedure is ongoing, and in that case the
state of the latter procedure shall not be affected. The RRLP PDU in the
LCS DOWNLINK INFORMATION message shall contain a complete RRLP PDU
according to the RRLP protocol 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.031. The GERAN shall transmit
the LCS DOWNLINK INFORMATION message on the downlink using AM RLC on
signalling radio bearer SRB3.

The SMLC may be a \"stand alone SMLC\" (and therefore not tightly
integrated to the GERAN). This can lead to message loss or truncation
during the Handover procedure (during change of BPSCH).

#### 7.13.1.3 Reception of LCS DOWNLINK INFORMATION message by the MS

When the MS has received an LCS DOWNLINK INFORMATION message, the MS
shall deliver the RRLP PDU to the LCS local application.

The MS shall detect RRLP PDU truncation if an LCS DOWNLINK INFORMATION
message is received carrying an RRLP PDU that is shorter than the
indicated length. If a truncated RRLP PDU is received, RRLP PDU shall be
discarded.

#### 7.13.1.4 Transmission of a response message by the MS

When the LCS local application has received and processed an RRLP PDU
from the LCS DOWNLINK INFORMATION message, one or two RRLP PDU\'s shall
be returned to the GERAN. The MS shall

1\> encapsulate the RRLP PDU received from the LCS local application in
the LCS UPLINK INFORMATION message;

1\> transmit the LCS UPLINK INFORMATION message on the uplink using AM
RLC on signalling radio bearer SRB3;

1\> if a second RRLP PDU is received from the LCS local application,
repeat the previous two steps;

Suspend/Resume functions of lower layers will prevent message loss on
the uplink. If the BPSCH is changed before the RLC ACK is received in
the MS, message duplication is possible in the uplink after change of
the physical channel.

#### 7.13.1.5 Reception of a response message by the GERAN

When the GERAN has received an LCS UPLINK INFORMATION message, the GERAN
shall deliver the RRLP PDU to the SMLC.

The GERAN shall detect RRLP PDU truncation if an LCS UPLINK INFORMATION
message is received carrying an RRLP PDU that is shorter than the
indicated length. If a trucated RRLP PDU is received, the RRLP PDU shall
be discarded.

#### 7.13.1.6 Invalid LCS DOWNLINK INFORMATION message

If the MS receives a LCS DOWNLINK INFORMATION message, which contains a
protocol error causing the variable PROTOCOL\_ERROR\_REJECT to be set to
TRUE according to sub-clause 8, the MS shall perform procedure specific
error handling as follows. The MS shall:

1\> transmit an RRC STATUS message on the SRB2;

1\> include the IE \"*Identification of Received Message*\";

1\> set the IE \"*Received Message Type*\" to LCS DOWNLINK INFORMATION
message;

1\> set the IE \"*RRC Transaction Identifier*\" to the value of \"RRC
transaction identifier\" in the entry for the LCS DOWNLINK INFORMATION
message in the table \"Rejected transactions\" in the variable
TRANSACTIONS;

1\> clear that entry;

1\> include the IE \"*Protocol Error Information*\" with contents set to
the value of the variable PROTOCOL\_ERROR\_INFORMATION;

> 1\> when the RRC STATUS message has been submitted to lower layers for
> transmission;

2\> continue with any ongoing processes and procedures as if the invalid
LCS DOWNLINK INFORMATION message has not been received.

7.14 Radio Bearer control procedures
------------------------------------

### 7.14.1 Reconfiguration procedures

FigureÂ 7.14.1.1: Radio Bearer Establishment, normal case

FigureÂ 7.14.1.2: Radio Bearer Establishment, MS reverts to old
configuration

FigureÂ 7.14.1.3: Radio Bearer Reconfiguration, normal flow

FigureÂ 7.14.1.4: Radio Bearer Reconfiguration, failure case

FigureÂ 7.14.1.5: Radio Bearer Release, normal case

FigureÂ 7.14.1.6: Radio Bearer Release, MS reverts to old configuration

#### 7.14.1.1 General

The reconfiguration procedures include the following procedures:

\- the Radio Bearer Establishment procedure;

\- the Radio Bearer Reconfiguration procedure;

\- the Radio Bearer Release procedure;

The Radio Bearer Establishment procedure is used to establish new radio
bearer(s).

The Radio Bearer Reconfiguration procedure is used to reconfigure
parameters for a radio bearer.

The Radio Bearer Release procedure is used to release radio bearer(s).

The Radio Bearer Reconfiguration procedure is used to reconfigure
transport channel(s).

#### 7.14.1.2 Initiation

To initiate any one of the reconfiguration procedures, the GERAN shall:

1\> configure new radio links in any new physical channel;

1\> start transmission and reception on the new radio links;

1\> for a Radio Bearer Establishment procedure:

2\> transmit a RADIO BEARER SETUP message on the SRB2;

2\> if signaling radio bearer SRB4 is setup with this procedure and
signaling radio bearers SRB1-SRB3 were already established prior to the
procedure:

3\> if the variable \"LATEST\_CONFIGURED\_CN\_DOMAIN\" has been
initialised:

4\> any radio bearers setup by the same message as signalling radio
bearer SRB4 shall be connected to the CN domain indicated in the
variable \"LATEST CONFIGURED CN DOMAIN\";

1\> for a Radio Bearer Reconfiguration procedure:

2\> transmit a RADIO BEARER RECONFIGURATION message on the SRB2;

1\> for a Radio Bearer Release procedure:

2\> transmit a RADIO BEARER RELEASE message on the SRB2;

1\> for a transport channel reconfiguration (setup, reconfigure or
release) procedure:

2\> transmit a RADIO BEARER SETUP, RADIO BEARER RECONFIGURATION or RADIO
BEARER RELEASE message on the SRB2.

1\> if transport channels are setup, reconfigured or released in uplink
and/or downlink:

2\> set TFCS according to the new transport channel(s).

1\> if transport channels are added or deleted in uplink and/or
downlink, and the IE \"*RB Mapping Info\"* applicable to the new
configuration has not been previously provided to the MS, the GERAN
shall:

2\> send the IE \"*RB Mapping Info\"* for the new configuration.

The RADIO BEARER RECONFIGURATION message shall include in case of SBSS
relocation procedure the structure \"*Downlink Counter Synchronisation
Info*\"and

1\> if ciphering and/or integrity protection are activated:

2\> include new ciphering and/or integrity protection configuration
information to be used after reconfiguration.

If one of the reconfiguration messages is transmited then the IE \"*New
G-RNTI*\" may be present.

NOTE 1: The RADIO BEARER RECONFIGURATION message always includes the IE
\"*RB Information to Reconfigure*\", even if GERAN does not require the
reconfiguration of any RB. In these cases, GERAN may include only the IE
\"*RB Identity*\" within the IE \"*RB Information to Reconfigure*\".

GERAN shall take the MS capabilities into account when setting the new
configuration. If the message is used to initiate a transition from
RRC-Cell\_Dedicated state to RRC-Cell\_Shared state, the RRC may
allocate the new physical resources.

#### 7.14.1.3 Reception of RADIO BEARER SETUP or RADIO BEARER RECONFIGURATION or RADIO BEARER RELEASE message by the MS

If the MS receives the one of the following reconfiguration messages:

\- RADIO BEARER SETUP; or

\- RADIO BEARER RECONFIGURATION; or

\- RADIO BEARER RELEASE;

it shall:

1\> set the variable ORDERED\_RECONFIGURATION to TRUE;

1\> act upon all received information elements as specified in
sub-clause 7.18 and 7.19, unless specified in the following and perform
the actions below.

1\> if a complete reconfiguration, setup or release is indicated in the
reconfiguration messages:

2\> initiate the radio bearer, transport channel and physical channel
reconfiguration in accordance with the received radio bearer, transport
channel and physical channel information elements as is specified in
sub-clauses 7.18 and 7.19.

The MS may first release the physical channel used at reception of the
reconfiguration message (i.e a RADIO BEARER SETUP message, a RADIO
BEARER RECONFIGURATION message or a RADIO BEARER RELEASE message). The
MS shall:

1\> then stop the RLC operation for the duration of the reconfiguration
procedure;

\"*RB Information to Reconfigure*\". GERAN has to include it even if it
does not require the reconfiguration of any RB.

If the MS is in RRC-Cell\_Dedicated state upon reception of the
reconfiguration message and remains in RRC-Cell\_Dedicated state after
that, the MS shall:

1\> stop the RLC operation for the duration of the reconfiguration
procedure;

1\> then establish a new physical channel and act upon all received
information elements as specified in sub-clause 7.19.6 and:

2\> if the IE \"*DBPSCH Description\"* is present then set the network
response times as specified in sub-clause 7.18.12;1\> if the
reconfiguration messages contain the transport channel information
elements:

2\> then establish,reconfigure or release a new transport channel and
act upon all received information elements as specified in sub-clause

basic physical subchannel(s) indicated in the received message the MS
shall:

1\> revert to the configuration prior to the reception of the message
(old configuration);

transmission:

2\> continue with any ongoing processes and procedures as if no
reconfiguration attempt had occurred;

2\> if a lower layer failure happens while attempting to connect back to
the old channels, the standard rules are applied according to 7.19.4.5.

#### 7.14.1.10 Reception of a response message by the GERAN, failure case

When the GERAN has received:

\- the RADIO BEARER SETUP FAILURE message; or

sub-clause 7.18.6) attempt had occurred. The operational parameters
(e.g. ciphering mode) when returning on the old channel are those
applied before the RADIO BEARER RECONFIGURATION message was received.

If the mobile station receives a RADIO BEARER RECONFIGURATION message
and if at least one of the following IEs, IE \"*Handover Reference*\",
IE \"*Power Command and Access Type*\", IE \"*Cell Description*\" and IE
\"*Description of the first channel after time*\" is not present, the MS
shall:

1\> send a a failure message according with sublcause 7.14.1.9 on the
SRB2 and does not attempt that reconfiguration as defined in sublcause
7.14.3;

1\> act and set the variables according with the sub-clauses 7.19 and
10.4; and

sub-clause 7.18.6) attempt had occurred. The operational parameters
(e.g. ciphering mode) when returning on the old channel are those
applied before the reconfiguration message was received.

If IE \"*SBPSCH Description*\" is present in the reconfiguration
messages and if the mobile station has been assigned more PDCHs than it
supports according to its MS multislot class or if the mobile station
has been assigned a TBF in EGPRS TBF mode and the MS does not support
EGPRS, or if the MS has been assigned an MCS (e.g. 8-PSK in the uplink)
that the MS does not support or if the failure is due to any other
reason, return to MAC-Idle state and cell reselection continues.

The MS shall:

1\> then send a failure message as specified in sub-clause 7.14.1.9 with
a cause \"protocol error unspecified\"

### 7.14.2 MS initiated DTM procedures while in RRC-Cell\_Dedicated-MAC-Dedicated state

#### 7.14.2.1 General

While in RRC-Cell\_Dedicated-MAC-Dedicated state, the establishment of
one or more SBPSCHs may be initiated by the RRC entity of the mobile
station using the DTM Request procedure. The procedure is used only for
existing radio bearers and is triggered by a request from upper layers
to transfer an upper layer PDU.

#### 7.14.2.2 Initiation of the DTM Request procedure by the MS

The mobile station initiates the DTM Request procedure by sending a
GERAN Iu mode DTM REQUEST message on the SRB2.

The MS shall set the IEs in the GERAN Iu mode DTM REQUEST message as
follows:

1\> calculate the START according to sub-clause 7.19.4 for the CN domain
as set in the IE \"*CN Domain Identity*\"; and

2\> include the calculated START value for that CN domain in the IE
\"*START*\";

1\> include IE \"*Iu mode* *RRC Channel RequestDescription*\" to
indicate the establishment cause, as applicable, a request to send user
data, page response or a mobility management message;

1\> may include \"*Integrity Check Info*\" IE. If the IE is included,
act as is specified in sub-clause 7.19.4.6;

The MS shall:

1\> transmit the GERAN Iu mode DTM REQUEST message on the uplink SRB 2;

1\> start timer T3148.

#### 7.14.2.3 Reception of a GERAN Iu mode DTM REQUEST message by the GERAN

##### 7.14.2.3.1 General

Upon receiving a GERAN Iu mode DTM REQUEST message, GERAN shall either:

1\> transmit the RADIO BEARER RECONFIGURATION message on the downlink
SRB 2 as specified in sub-clause 7.14.2.3.2; or

1\> transmit the GERAN Iu mode DTM REJECT message on the downlink SRB 2
as specified in sub-clause 7.14.2.3.3.

##### 7.14.2.3.2 SBPSCH assignment

On receipt of a GERAN Iu mode DTM REQUEST message the network may
allocate one or more uplink SBPSCH(s) for the mobile station. The
SBPSCH(s) are assigned to the mobile station in the RADIO BEARER
RECONFIGURATION message.

The RADIO BEARER RECONFIGURATION is sent on SRB2 as specified in
sub-clause 7.14.1. If frequency hopping is applied, the mobile station
shall use the cell allocation defined for the cell to decode the mobile
allocation.

The allocation of the uplink SBPSCH(s) may imply the reallocation of the
DBPSCH(s). The RADIO BEARER RECONFIGURATION message shall not be used to
change to a dependent configuration.

On receipt of a RADIO BEARER RECONFIGURATION message the mobile station
shall stop T3148.

If the received RADIO BEARER RECONFIGURATION message includes uplink
SBPSCH(s), the mobile station shall proceed as specified in
sub-clauseÂ 7.14.1.3. If the received RADIO BEARER RECONFIGURATION
message includes downlink SBPSCH(s) and no uplink SBPSCH(s), the mobile
station shall stop T3148, abort the DTM request procedure and proceed as
specified in sub-clauseÂ 7.14.1.3, and then attempt an establishment of
uplink TBF, using the applicable procedure specified in 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.160.

If the RADIO BEARER RECONFIGURATION includes allocation of one or more
uplink SBPSCHs but the resources can not be allocated for all RBs
requested by the mobile station, then failure is triggered for the radio
bearers to which resources where not granted and T3148 is stopped.
Request of resources for failed RBs is then done as specified in
3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.160.

##### 7.14.2.3.3 DTM Request rejection

If the network cannot allocate the requested SBPSCH(s) it may send to
the mobile station a GERAN Iu mode DTM REJECT message on the SRB2. This
message shall contain

1\> the \"*Wait Indication*\" IE;

1\> the \"*RB Identity*\" IE set to the RB\_IDENTITY;

1\> the \"*RRC transaction identifier*\" IE set to the the value of
\"RRC transaction identifier\" in the entry for the GERAN Iu mode DTM
REJECT message in the table \"Rejected transactions\" in the variable
TRANSACTIONS;

1\> the \"*Failure Cause*\" IE set to the cause value \"protocol
error\";

1\> the \"*Protocol Error Information*\" IE with contents set to the
value of the variable PROTOCOL\_ERROR\_INFORMATION.

##### 7.14.2.3.4 Reception of a GERAN Iu mode DTM REJECT message by the MS, normal case

On receipt of the GERAN Iu mode DTM REJECT message, the mobile station
shall:

1\> stop T3148;

1\> notify upper layers of a SBPSCH establishment failure;

1\> start timer T3142 with the value given in the \"*Wait Indication*\"
information element.

The mobile station is not allowed to make a new attempt for a DTM
request procedure in the same cell until T3142 expires. The value of the
wait indication (i.e. T3142) relates to the cell from which it was
received.

After sending GERAN Iu mode DTM REQUEST message the MS shall wait for
the response from the network or expiry of timer T3148 before it may
initiate new DTM Request procedure.

The GERAN Iu mode DTM Reject procedure rejects all pending requests that
were sent in the previous GERAN Iu mode DTM Request message.

##### 7.14.2.3.5 Invalid GERAN Iu mode DTM REJECT message

If the MS receives an GERAN Iu mode DTM REJECT message which contains a
protocol error causing the variable PROTOCOL\_ERROR\_REJECT to be set to
TRUE according to sub-clause 8, the MS shall perform procedure specific
error handling as follows:

The MS shall:

1\> set the variable PROTOCOL\_ERROR\_INDICATOR to TRUE;

1\> set the IEs in the GERAN Iu mode DTM REQUEST message as specified in
sub-clause 7.14.2.2;

1\> transmit the GERAN Iu mode DTM REQUEST message on the uplink SRB 2;

1\> start timer T3148.

#### 7.14.2.4 Abnormal cases

Abnormal cases related to radio bearer reconfiguration procedures are
defined in sub-clause 7.14.1.14.

In the following cases a GERAN Iu mode DTM Request failure has occurred:

\- At expiry of T3148;

\- If a RADIO BEARER RECONFIGURATION message indicates resources in a
non-supported frequency band. The cause value is \"frequency not
implemented\". The actions are defined in sub-clause 7.14.1.14.

\- If the information available in the mobile station after the
reception of a RADIO BEARER RECONFIGURATION message does not
satisfactorily define uplink packet resources. The cause value is
\"protocol error unspecified\". The actions are defined in sub-clause
7.14.1.14.

\- If a RADIO BEARER RECONFIGURATION message includes a mobile
allocation or a frequency list that indexes frequencies in more than one
frequency band. The cause value is \"frequency not implemented\". The
actions are defined in sub-clause 7.14.1.14.

\- If a RADIO BEARER RECONFIGURATION message assigns resources not
compliant with the multislot capabilities of the mobile station. The
cause value is \"channel mode unacceptable\". The actions are defined in
sub-clause 7.14.1.14.

\- If the mobile station has no current CA and if it needs a CA to
analyse the RADIO BEARER RECONFIGURATION message. The cause value is
\"no cell allocation available\". The actions are defined in sub-clause
7.14.1.14.

\- If the RADIO BEARER RECONFIGURATION message instructs the mobile
station to use a channel description or mode that it does not support.
The cause value is \"channel mode unacceptable\". The actions are
defined in sub-clause 7.14.1.14.

\- If the RADIO BEARER RECONFIGURATION message does not include any
uplink or downlink packet resources. The cause value is \"protocol error
unspecified \". The actions are defined in sub-clause 7.14.1.4.

#### 7.14.2.5 T3148 expiry

> On expiry of timer T3148 DTM Request procedure has failed on the
> mobile station side. The mobile station shall then reinitiate DTM
> Request procedure unless it has already been reinitiated 4 times. In
> that case DTM Request procedure shall be aborted.

7.15 Signalling flow procedures
-------------------------------

### 7.15.1 Signalling connection release procedure

#### 7.15.1.1 General

FigureÂ 7.15.1.1.1: Signalling Connection Release procedure, normal case

The Signalling Connection Release procedure is used to notify to the MS
that one of its ongoing signalling connections has been released. The
procedure does not initiate the release of the RRC connection.

#### 7.15.1.2 Initiation of SIGNALLING CONNECTION RELEASE by the GERAN

To initiate the procedure, the GERAN transmits a SIGNALLING CONNECTION
RELEASE message on SRB 2 .

#### 7.15.1.3 Reception of SIGNALLING CONNECTION RELEASE by the MS

Upon reception of a SIGNALLING CONNECTION RELEASE message, the MS shall:

1\> indicate the release of the signalling connection and pass the value
of the IE \"*CN Domain Identity*\" to upper layers;

1\> remove the signalling connection with the identity indicated by the
IE \"*CN Domain Identity*\" from the variable
ESTABLISHED\_SIGNALLING\_CONNECTIONS;

1\> clear the entry for the SIGNALLING CONNECTION RELEASE message in the
table \"Accepted transactions\" in the variable TRANSACTIONS;

1\> the procedure ends.

#### 7.15.1.4 Invalid SIGNALLING CONNECTION RELEASE message

If the MS receives a SIGNALLING CONNECTION RELEASE message, which
contains a protocol error causing the variable PROTOCOL\_ERROR\_REJECT
to be set to TRUE according to sub-clause 8, the MS shall perform
procedure specific error handling as follows:

1\> include the IE \"*Identification of Received Message*\"; and

2\> set the IE \"*Received Message Type*\" to SIGNALLING CONNECTION
RELEASE;

2\> set the IE \"*RRC Transaction Identifier*\" to the value of \"RRC
transaction identifier\" in the entry for the SIGNALLING CONNECTION
RELEASE message in the table \"Rejected transactions\" in the variable
TRANSACTIONS; and

2\> clear that entry;

1\> include the IE \"*Protocol Error Information*\" with contents set to
the value of the variable PROTOCOL\_ERROR\_INFORMATION;

1\> transmit an RRC STATUS message on SRB 2 uplink;

1\> when the RRC STATUS message has been submitted to lower layers for
transmission:

2\> continue with any ongoing processes and procedures as if the invalid
SIGNALLING CONNECTION RELEASE message has not been received.

#### 7.15.1.5 Invalid configuration

If radio access bearers for the CN domain indicated by the IE \"CN
domain identity\" exist in the variable ESTABLISHED\_RABS, the MS shall:

1\> transmit an RRC STATUS message on SRB 2 uplink using AM RLC;

1\> include the IE \"*Identification of Received Message*\"; and

1\> set the IE \"*Received Message Type*\" to SIGNALLING CONNECTION
RELEASE; and

1\> set the IE \"*RRC Transaction Identifier*\" to the value of \"RRC
transaction identifier\" in the entry for the SIGNALLING CONNECTION
RELEASE message in the table \"Accepted transactions\" in the variable
TRANSACTIONS and clear that entry;

1\> include the IE \"*Protocol Error Information*\" with contents set to
the value \"Message not compatible with receiver state\";

1\> when the RRC STATUS message has been submitted to lower layers for
transmission:

2\> continue with any ongoing processes and procedures as if the invalid
SIGNALLING CONNECTION RELEASE message has not been received.

### 7.15.2 Signalling connection release indication procedure

#### 7.15.2.1 General

FigureÂ 7.15.2.1.1: Signalling Connection Release Indication procedure,
normal case

The Signalling Connection Release Indication procedure is used by the MS
to indicate to the GERAN that one of its signalling connections has been
released. The procedure may in turn initiate the RRC connection release
procedure.

#### 7.15.2.2 Initiation

The MS shall, on receiving a request to release (abort) the signalling
connection from upper layers:

1\> if a signalling connection in the variable
ESTABLISHED\_SIGNALLING\_CONNECTIONS for the specific CN domain
identified with the IE \"*CN domain identity*\" exists:

2\> initiate the signalling connection release indication procedure.

1\> otherwise:

2\> abort any ongoing establishment of signalling connection for that
specific CN domain as specified in 7.15.2.2a.

Upon Initiation of the Signalling Connection Release Indication
procedure in RRC-GRA\_PCH state, the MS shall:

1\> perform a Cell Update procedure, according to sub-clause 7.8, using
the cause \"uplink data transmission\";

1\> when the Cell Update procedure completed successfully:

2\> continue with the signalling connection release indication procedure
as described below;

The MS shall:

1\> set the IE \"*CN Domain Identity*\" to the value indicated by the
upper layers. The value of the IE indicates the CN domain whose
associated signalling connection the upper layers are indicating to be
released;

1\> remove the signalling connection with the identity indicated by
upper layers from the variable ESTABLISHED\_SIGNALLING\_CONNECTIONS;

1\> transmit a SIGNALLING CONNECTION RELEASE INDICATION message on SRB
2.

When the successful delivery of the SIGNALLING CONNECTION RELEASE
INDICATION message has been confirmed by RLC sub-layer the procedure
ends.

#### 7.15.2.2a RLC re-establishment, inter-mode handover or inter-RAT change

If a re-establishment of RLC on signalling radio bearer SRB2 occurs
before the successful delivery of the SIGNALLING CONNECTION RELEASE
INDICATION message has been confirmed by RLC sublayer, the MS shall:

1\> retransmit the SIGNALLING CONNECTION RELEASE INDICATION message on
the uplink using signalling radio bearer SRB2.

If an inter-RAT handover from GERAN procedure occurs before the
successful delivery of the SIGNALLING CONNECTION RELEASE INDICATION
message has been confirmed by RLC sublayer, the MS shall:

1\> abort the signalling connection while in the new RAT.

If an inter-mode handover procedure occurs before the successful
delivery of the SIGNALLING CONNECTION RELEASE INDICATION message has
been confirmed by RLC sublayer, the MS shall:

1\> abort the signalling connection while in A/Gb mode*.*

#### 7.15.2.3 Reception of SIGNALLING CONNECTION RELEASE INDICATION by the GERAN

Upon reception of a SIGNALLING CONNECTION RELEASE INDICATION message,
the GERAN requests the release of the signalling connection from upper
layers. Upper layers may then initiate the release of the signalling
connection.

7.16 Security mode control
--------------------------

### 7.16.1 Security mode control

FigureÂ 7.16.1.1: Security mode control procedure

#### 7.16.1.1 General

The purpose of this procedure is to trigger the start of ciphering or to
command the restart of the ciphering with a new ciphering configuration,
for the radio bearers of one CN domain and for all signalling radio
bearers.

It is also used to start integrity protection or to modify the integrity
protection configuration for all signalling radio bearers.

#### 7.16.1.2 Initiation

##### 7.16.1.2.1 Ciphering configuration change

To start/restart ciphering, GERAN sends a SECURITY MODE COMMAND message
on one downlink SRB2 using the most recent ciphering configuration. If
no such ciphering configuration exists then the SECURITY MODE COMMAND
message is not ciphered. The GERAN shall not transmit a SECURITY MODE
COMMAND message to signal a change in ciphering algorithm.

When configuring ciphering, GERAN shall ensure that the MS needs to
store at most two different ciphering configurations (keyset and
algorithm) per CN domain, in total over all radio bearers at any given
time. For signalling radio bearers the total number of ciphering
configurations that need to be stored is at most three.

Prior to sending the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message, for the CN domain
indicated in the IE \"*CN Domain Identity*\" in the SECURITY MODE
COMMAND message, the GERAN shall:

1\> suspend all radio bearers using RLC-AM or RLC-UM and suspend all
signalling radio bearers using RLC-AM or RLC-UM, except the signalling
radio bearer used to send the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message on the
downlink SRB2 according to the following:

2\> send an indication to lower layers:

3\> not to transmit RLC PDUs with sequence number greater than or equal
to the number in IE \"*RB Downlink Ciphering Activation Time Info*\" in
the IE \"*Ciphering Mode Info*\" on all suspended radio bearers and all
suspended signalling radio bearers;

3\> set, for the signalling radio bearer used to send the SECURITY MODE
COMMAND message, the \"RLC sequence number\" in IE \"*RB Downlink
Ciphering Activation Time Info*\" in the IE \"*Ciphering Mode Info*\",
at which time the new ciphering configuration shall be applied;

1\> if a transparent mode radio bearer for this CN domain exists

2\> include the \"Ciphering Activation Time for DBPSCH\" in IE
\"*Ciphering Mode Info*\", at which time the new ciphering configuration
shall be applied;

2\> GERAN chooses the value for the \" Ciphering Activation Time for
DBPSCH \" such that the new ciphering configuration will occur after all
the pending ciphering activation times have been reached for the
transparent mode radio bearers of this CN domain.

1\> consider an ciphering activation time in downlink to be pending
until the RLC sequence number of the next RLC PDU to be transmitted for
the first time is equal to or larger than the selected activation time;

1\> set, for each suspended radio bearer and signalling radio bearer
that has no pending ciphering activation time set by a previous security
mode control procedure, an \"RLC sequence number\" in IE \"*RB Downlink
Ciphering Activation Time Info*\" in the IE \"*Ciphering Mode Info*\",
at which time the new ciphering configuration shall be applied;

1\> set, for each suspended radio bearer and signalling radio bearer
that has a pending ciphering activation time set by a previous security
mode control procedure, the \"RLC sequence number\" in IE \"*RB Downlink
Ciphering Activation Time Info*\" in the IE \"*Ciphering Mode Info*\" to
the value used in the previous security mode control procedure, at which
time the latest ciphering configuration shall be applied.

1\> if Integrity protection has already been started for the MS; and

2\> if for the CN domain indicated in the IE \"*CN* *Domain Identity*\"
in the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message, a new security key set (new
ciphering and integrity protection keys) has been received from upper
layers since the transmission of the last SECURITY MODE COMMAND message
for that CN domain:

3\> include the IE \"*Integrity Protection Mode Info*\" in the SECURITY
MODE COMMAND message

1\> if integrity protection has already been started for the MS; and

2\> if the IE \"*CN Domain Identity*\" in the SECURITY MODE COMMAND
message is different from the IE \"*CN Domain Identity*\" that was sent
in the previous SECURITY MODE COMMAND message to the MS:

3\> include the IE \"*Integrity Protection Mode Info*\" in the SECURITY
MODE COMMAND message

1\> transmit the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message on the downlink SRB2.

##### 7.16.1.2.2 Integrity protection configuration change

To start or modify integrity protection, the GERAN sends a SECURITY MODE
COMMAND message on the downlink SRB2 using the new integrity protection
configuration. The GERAN shall not modify integrity protection for a CN
domain for which a SECURITY MODE COMMAND message configuring integrity
protection has been previously sent for an ongoing signalling connection
unless the application of new integrity keys needs to be signalled to
the MS. The GERAN shall not transmit a SECURITY MODE COMMAND message to
signal a change in integrity protection algorithm.

When configuring Integrity protection, the GERAN shall:

1\> ensure that the MS needs to store at most three different Integrity
protection configurations (keysets) at any given time. This includes the
total number of Integrity protection configurations for all signalling
radio bearers.

1\> if Ciphering has already been started for the MS for the CN domain
to be set in the IE \"*CN Domain Identity*\" in the SECURITY MODE
COMMAND message; and

2\> if for the CN domain indicated in the IE \"*CN* *Domain Identity*\"
in the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message, a new security key set (new
ciphering and integrity protection keys) has been received from upper
layers since the transmission of the last SECURITY MODE COMMAND message
for that CN domain:

3\> include the IE \"*Ciphering Mode Info*\" in the SECURITY MODE
COMMAND message;

COMMAND message;

Prior to sending the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message, for the CN domain
indicated in the IE \"*CN Domain Identity*\" in the SECURITY MODE
COMMAND message, the GERAN shall:

1\> if this is the first SECURITY MODE COMMAND message sent for this RRC
connection:

2\> if new keys have been received:

3\> initialise the hyper frame numbers as follows:

4\> set all bits of the hyper frame numbers of the COUNT-I values for
all signalling radio bearers to zero;

2\> else (if new keys have not been received):

3\> use the value \"START\" in the most recently received IE \"*START
List*\" or IE \"*START*\" that belongs to the CN domain indicated in the
IE \"*CN Domain Identity*\" to initialise all hyper frame numbers of
COUNT-I for all the signalling radio bearers; by:

4\> setting the 20 most significant bits of the hyper frame numbers for
all signalling radio bearers to the value \"START\" in the most recently
received IE \"*START List*\" or IE \"*START*\" for that CN domain;

4\> setting the remaining bits of the hyper frame numbers equal to zero;

1\> else (this is not the first SECURITY MODE COMMAND message sent for
this RRC connection):

2\> if new keys have been received;

3\> initialise the hyper frame number for COUNT-I for SRB2 as follows:

4\> set all bits of the HFN of the COUNT-I value for SRB2 to zero;

2\> if new keys have not been received;

3\> initialize the hyper frame number for COUNT-I for SRB2 as follows:

4\> set the 20 most significant bits of the HFN of the downlink and
uplink COUNT-I to the value of the most recently received IE \"*START*\"
or IE \"*START List*\" for the CN domain to be set in the the IE \"*CN
Domain Identity*\";

4\> set the remaining bits of the HFN of the downlink and uplink COUNT-I
to zero;

1\> if the IE \"*Integrity Protection Mode Command*\" has the value
\"Start\":

2\> prohibit the transmission of signalling messages with any RRC SN on

3\> prohibit the transmission of signalling messages with RRC SN greater
or equal to the RRC sequence number in entry for signalling radio bearer
n in the \"RRC message sequence number list\" in the IE \"*Downlink

2\> consider an integrity protection activation time in downlink to be
pending until the selected activation time is equal to the next RRC
sequence number to be used, which means that the last RRC message using
the old integrity protection configuration has been transmitted to lower
layers;

2\> set, for each signalling radio bearer SRBn, that has no pending
integrity protection activation time set by a previous security mode
control procedure, an RRC sequence number in entry for signalling radio

security mode control procedure, at which time the latest integrity
protection configuration shall be applied;

1\> transmit the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message on SRB2 using the new

NOTE 1: In the case of re-initialisation of Integrity Protection at HFN
wrap around, the network takes into account the MS actions as described
in sub-clauses 7.18.5.1 and 7.18.5.2

NOTE 2: After the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message is transmitted, the
network needs to ensure that it can revert back to the old integrity
protection until it receives a SECURITY MODE COMPLETE message, and take
into account the MS actions when the Security Mode Control procedure is
unsuccessful. The network is also aware that the MS may revert to old
configuration when waiting for the acknowledgement from layer 2 for
SECURITY MODE COMPLETE message, and it has to act accordingly.

belongs to the CN domain as indicated in the IE \"*CN Domain Identity*\"
to initialise all hyper frame numbers of the downlink and uplink COUNT-I
values respectively for all the signalling radio bearers other than SRB2
by:

5\> setting the 20 most significant bits of the hyper frame numbers of
the downlink and uplink COUNT-I respectively for all signalling radio
bearers to the value \"START\" in the most recently received IE \"*START
List*\" or IE \"*START*\" for that CN domain;

5\> setting the remaining bits of the hyper frame numbers equal to zero.

1\> send an indication to upper layers that the new integrity protection
configuration has been activated;

1\> resume in the downlink, all suspended radio bearers and all
signalling radio bearers;

1\> allow the transmission of RRC messages on all signalling radio

7.17 Delivery of Non-Access stratum messages
--------------------------------------------

### 7.17.1 Initial Direct transfer

FigureÂ 7.17.1.1: Initial Direct transfer in the uplink, normal flow

#### 7.17.1.1 General

The Initial Direct Transfer procedure is used in the uplink to establish
a signalling connection. It is also used to carry an initial upper layer
(NAS) messages over the radio interface.

#### 7.17.1.2 Initiation of Initial direct transfer procedure in the MS

In the MS, the Initial Direct Transfer procedure shall be initiated,
when the upper layers request establishment of a signalling connection.
This request also includes a request for the transfer of a NAS message.

Upon initiation of the Initial Direct Transfer procedure when the MS is
in RRC-Idle mode, the MS shall:

1\> set the variable ESTABLISHMENT\_CAUSE to the cause for establishment
indicated by upper layers;

1\> perform an RRC Connection Establishment procedure, according to
sub-clause 7.5;

1\> if the RRC Connection Establishment procedure was not successful:

2\> indicate failure to establish the signalling connection to upper
layers and end the procedure;

1\> when the RRC Connection Establishment procedure is completed
successfully:

2\> continue with the Initial Direct Transfer procedure as below;

Upon initiation of the Initial Direct Transfer procedure when the MS is
in RRC-GRA\_PCH state, the MS shall:

1\> perform a Cell Update procedure, according to sub-clause 7.8, using
the cause \"uplink data transmission\";

1\> when the Cell Update procedure completed successfully:

2\> continue with the Initial Direct Transfer procedure as below.

The MS shall, in the INITIAL DIRECT TRANSFER message:

1\> set the IE \"*NAS Message*\" as received from upper layers; and

1\> set the IE \"*CN* *Domain Identity*\" as indicated by the upper
layers; and

2\> set the IE \"*Intra Domain NAS Node Selector*\" as follows:

2\> derive the IE \"*Intra Domain NAS Node Selector*\" from TMSI/PMTSI,
IMSI, or IMEI; and

2\> provide the coding of the IE \"*Intra Domain NAS Node Selector*\"
according to the following priorities:

1\. derive the routing parameter for IDNNS from TMSI (CS domain) or
PTMSI (PS domain) whenever a valid TMSI/PTMSI is available;

2\. base the routing parameter for IDNNS on IMSI when no valid
TMSI/PTMSI is available;

3\. base the routing parameter for IDNNS on IMEI only if no (U)SIM is
inserted in the MS.

1\> calculate the START according to sub-clause 7.18.4 for the CN domain
as set in the IE \"*CN Domain Identity*\"; and

2\> include the calculated START value for that CN domain in the IE
\"*START*\";

The MS shall:

1\> transmit the INITIAL DIRECT TRANSFER message on the uplink using AM
RLC on signalling radio bearer SRB 3;

1\> when the INITIAL DIRECT TRANSFER message has been submitted to lower
layers for transmission:

2\> confirm the establishment of a signalling connection to upper
layers; and

2\> add the signalling connection with the identity indicated by the IE
\"*CN* *Domain Identity*\" in the variable
ESTABLISHED\_SIGNALLING\_CONNECTIONS; and

1\> when the successful delivery of the INITIAL DIRECT TRANSFER message
has been confirmed by RLC sub-layer:

2\> the procedure ends.

When not stated otherwise elsewhere, the MS may also initiate the
initial direct transfer procedure when another procedure is ongoing, and
in that case the state of the latter procedure shall not be affected.

A new signalling connection request may be received from upper layers
subsequent to the indication of the release of a previously established
signalling connection to upper layers. From the time of the indication
of release to upper layers until the MS has entered RRC-Idle mode, any
such upper layer request to establish a new signalling connection shall
be queued. This request shall be processed after the MS has entered
RRC-Idle mode.

#### 7.17.1.3 RLC re-establishment, inter-mode handover or inter-RAT change

If a re-establishment of RLC on SRB3 occurs before the successful
delivery of the INITIAL DIRECT TRANSFER message has been confirmed by
RLC, the MS shall:

1\> retransmit the INITIAL DIRECT TRANSFER message on the uplink using
SRB3.

If inter-mode handover occurs before the successful delivery of the
INITIAL DIRECT TRANSFER message has been confirmed by RLC, for messages
with the IE \"*CN Domain Identity*\" set to \"CS domain\", the MS shall:

1\> retransmit the NAS message as specified in sub-clause 7.8.4.4

If inter-RAT handover occurs before the successful delivery of the
INITIAL DIRECT TRANSFER message has been confirmed by RLC, the MS shall:

1.  retransmit the NAS message as specified in sub-clause 7.10.4.

#### 7.17.1.4 Abortion of signalling connection establishment

If the MS receives a request from upper layers to release (abort) the
signalling connection for the CN domain for which the initial direct
transfer procedure is ongoing, the MS shall:

1\> if the MS has not yet entered GERAN RRC-Connected mode:

2\> abort the RRC Connection Establishment procedure as specified in
sub-clause 7.5.1.6;

the procedure ends.

#### 7.17.1.5 Reception of INITIAL DIRECT TRANSFER message by the GERAN

On reception of the INITIAL DIRECT TRANSFER message the NAS message
should be routed using the IE \"*CN Domain Identity*\". GERAN may also
use the IE \"*Intra Domain NAS Node Selector*\" for routing among the CN
nodes for the addressed CN domain.

If no signalling connection exists towards the chosen node, then a
signalling connection is established.

When the GERAN receives an INITIAL DIRECT TRANSFER message, it shall not
affect the state of any other ongoing RRC procedures, when not stated
otherwise elsewhere.

The GERAN should:

1\> set the START value for the CN domain indicated in the IE \"*CN
Domain Identity*\" to the value of the IE \"*START*\".

### 7.17.2 Downlink Direct transfer

FigureÂ 7.17.2.1: Downlink Direct transfer, normal flow

#### 7.17.2.1 General

The Downlink Direct Transfer procedure is used in the downlink direction
to carry upper layer (NAS) messages over the radio interface.

#### 7.17.2.2 Initiation of downlink direct transfer procedure in the GERAN

In the GERAN, the Direct Transfer procedure is initiated when the upper
layers request the transfer of a NAS message after the initial
signalling connection is established. The GERAN may also initiate the
Downlink Direct Transfer procedure when another RRC procedure is
ongoing, and in that case the state of the latter procedure shall not be
affected. The GERAN shall transmit the DOWNLINK DIRECT TRANSFER message
on the downlink using AM RLC on signalling radio bearer SRB 3 or
signalling radio bearer SRB 4. The GERAN should:

1\> if upper layers indicate \"low priority\" for this message:

2\> select signalling radio bearer SRB4, if available. Specifically, for
a GSM-MAP based CN, signalling radio SRB4 should, if available, be
selected when \"SAPI 3\" is requested;

2\> select signalling radio SRB3 when signalling radio SRB 4 is not
available;

1\> if upper layers indicate \"high priority\" for this message:

2\> select signalling radio SRB3. Specifically, for a GSM-MAP based CN,
signalling radio bearer RB3 should be selected when \"SAPI 0\" is
requested.

The GERAN sets the IE \"*CN Domain Identity*\" to indicate, which CN
domain the NAS message is originated from*.*

#### 7.17.2.3 Reception of a DOWNLINK DIRECT TRANSFER message by the MS

Upon reception of the DOWNLINK DIRECT TRANSFER message, the MS RRC
shall, using the IE \"*CN Domain Identity*\", route the contents of the
IE \"*NAS Message*\" and the value of the IE\"*CN Domain Identity*\" to
the upper layers.

The MS shall clear the entry for the DOWNLINK DIRECT TRANSFER message in
the table \"Accepted transactions\" in the variable TRANSACTIONS.

When the MS receives a DOWNLINK DIRECT TRANSFER message, it shall not
affect the state of any other ongoing RRC procedures when not stated
otherwise elsewhere.

#### 7.17.2.4 No signalling connection exists

If the MS receives a DOWNLINK DIRECT TRANSFER message, and the
signalling connection identified with the IE \"*CN Domain Identity*\"
does not exist according to the variable
ESTABLISHED\_SIGNALLING\_CONNECTIONS, the MS shall:

1\> ignore the content of the DOWNLINK DIRECT TRANSFER message;

1\> transmit an RRC STATUS message on the uplink SRB2;

1\> include the IE \"*Identification of Received Message*\"; and

1\> set the IE \"*Received Message Type*\" to DOWNLINK DIRECT TRANSFER
message; and

1\> set the IE \"*RRC Transaction Identifier*\" to the value of \"RRC
transaction identifier\" in the entry for the DOWNLINK DIRECT TRANSFER
message in the table \"Accepted transactions\" in the variable
TRANSACTIONS; and

1\> clear that entry;

1\> include the IE \"*Protocol Error Information*\" with the IE
\"*Protocol Error Cause*\" set to \"Message not compatible with receiver
state\".

When the RRC STATUS message has been submitted to lower layers for
transmission, the MS shall:

1\> continue with any ongoing processes and procedures as if the
DOWNLINK DIRECT TRANSFER message has not been received.

#### 7.17.2.5 Invalid DOWNLINK DIRECT TRANSFER message

If the MS receives a DOWNLINK DIRECT TRANSFER message, which contains a
protocol error causing the variable PROTOCOL\_ERROR\_REJECT to be set to
TRUE according to clause 8 the MS shall perform procedure specific error
handling as follows:

1\> transmit an RRC STATUS message on the uplink SRB2;

1\> include the IE \"*Identification of Received Message*\"; and

1\> set the IE \"*Received Message Type*\" to DOWNLINK DIRECT TRANSFER;
and

1\> set the IE \"*RRC Transaction Identifier*\" to the value of \"RRC
transaction identifier\" in the entry for the DOWNLINK DIRECT TRANSFER
message in the table \"Rejected transactions\" in the variable
TRANSACTIONS; and

1\> clear that entry;

1\> include the IE \"*Protocol Error Information*\" with contents set to
the value of the variable PROTOCOL\_ERROR\_INFORMATION.

When the RRC STATUS message has been submitted to lower layers for
transmission, the MS shall:

1\> continue with any ongoing processes and procedures as if the invalid
DOWNLINK DIRECT TRANSFER message has not been received.

### 7.17.3 Uplink Direct transfer

FigureÂ 7.17.3.1: Uplink Direct transfer, normal flow

#### 7.17.3.1 General

The Uplink Direct Transfer procedure is used in the uplink direction to
carry all subsequent upper layer (NAS) messages over the radio interface
belonging to a signalling connection.

#### 7.17.3.2 Initiation of uplink direct transfer procedure in the MS

In the MS, the Uplink Direct Transfer procedure shall be initiated when
the upper layers request a transfer of a NAS message on an existing
signalling connection. When not stated otherwise elsewhere, the MS may
initiate the Uplink Direct Transfer procedure when another procedure is
ongoing, and in that case the state of the latter procedure shall not be
affected.

Upon initiation of the Uplink Direct Transfer procedure in RRC-GRA\_PCH
state, the MS shall:

1\> perform a Cell Update procedure, according to sub-clause 7.8, using
the cause \"uplink data transmission\";

1\> when the Cell Update procedure has been completed successfully:

2\> continue with the Uplink Direct Transfer procedure as below.

The MS shall transmit the UPLINK DIRECT TRANSFER message on the uplink
using AM RLC on signalling radio bearer SRB3 or signalling radio bearer
SRB4. The MS shall:

1\> if upper layers indicates \"low priority\" for this message:

2\> select signalling radio SRB4, if available. Specifically, for a
GSM-MAP based CN, signalling radio bearer SRB4 shall, if available, be
selected when \"SAPI 3\" is requested;

2\> select signalling radio bearer SRB3 when signalling radio bearer
SRB4 is not available;

1\> if upper layers indicates \"high priority\" for this message:

2\> select signalling radio bearer SRB3. Specifically, for a GSM-MAP
based CN, signalling radio bearer SRB3 shall be selected when \"SAPI 0\"
is requested.

The MS shall set the IE \"*NAS Message\"* as received from upper layers
and set the IE \"*CN Domain Identity*\" as indicated by the upper
layers.

When the sucessful delivery of the UPLINK DIRECT TRANSFER message has
been confirmed by RLC sub-layer the procedure ends.

#### 7.17.3.3 RLC re-establishment, inter-mode handover or inter-RAT change

If SRB n (where n equals to 3 or 4) was used when transmitting the
UPLINK DIRECT TRANSFER message and a re-establishment of RLC on the same
SRB n occurs before the successful delivery of the UPLINK DIRECT
TRANSFER message has been confirmed by RLC, the MS shall:

1\> retransmit the UPLINK DIRECT TRANSFER message on the uplink SRB n.

If inter-mode handover occurs before the successful delivery of the
UPLINK DIRECT TRANSFER message has been confirmed by RLC, for messages
with the IE \"CN Domain Identity\" set to \"CS domain\", the MS shall:

1\> retransmit the NAS message as specified in sub-clause 7.8.4.4

If inter-RAT handover occurs before the successful delivery of the
UPLINK DIRECT TRANSFER message has been confirmed by RLC, the MS shall:

1\> retransmit the NAS message as specified in sub-clause 7.10.4.

#### 7.17.3.4 Reception of UPLINK DIRECT TRANSFER message by the GERAN

On reception of the UPLINK DIRECT TRANSFER message the NAS message
should be routed using the value indicated in the IE \"*CN Domain
Identity*\".

When the GERAN receives an UPLINK DIRECT TRANSFER message, it shall not
affect the state of any other ongoing RRC procedures, when not stated
otherwise elsewhere.

7.18 General procedures
-----------------------

### 7.18.1 Selection of initial MS identity

The purpose of the IE \"*Initial MS Identity*\" is to provide a unique
MS identification at the establishment of an RRC connection. The MS
shall choose \"MS id type\" in the IE \"*Initial MS Identity*\" with the
following priority:

1\. TMSI (GSM-MAP): The TMSI (GSM-MAP) shall be chosen if available. The
IE \"*LAI*\" in the IE \"*Initial MS Identity*\" shall also be present
when TMSI (GSM-MAP) is used.

2\. P-TMSI (GSM-MAP): The P-TMSI (GSM-MAP) shall be chosen if available
and no TMSI (GSM-MAP) is available. The IE \"*RAI*\" in the IE
\"*Initial MS Identity*\" shall in this case also be present when P-TMSI
(GSM-MAP) is used.

3\. IMSI (GSM-MAP): The IMSI (GSM-MAP) shall be chosen if no TMSI
(GSM-MAP) or P-TMSI is available.

4\. IMEI: The IMEI shall be chosen when none of the above three
conditions are fulfilled.

When being used, the IEs \"*TMSI* *(GSM-MAP)*\", \"*P-TMSI (GSM-MAP)*\",
\"*IMSI (GSM-MAP)*\", \"*LAI*\" and \"*RAI*\" shall be set equal to the
values of the corresponding identities stored in the USIM.

If the variable SELECTED\_PLMN in the MS indicates \"ANSI-41\", the MS
shall choose \"*MS Id Type*\" in the IE \"*Initial MS Identity*\"
according to the procedure specified in the 3GPP2 document \"3GPP2
C.P0004-A\".

2\> if a new security key set was received for this CN domain but was
not used either for integrity protection or ciphering during this RRC
connection:

3\> set the \"START\" value for this domain to zero; and

3\> store this \"START\" value for this domain in the USIM.

2\> else:

3\> if the current \"START\" value, according to sub-clause 7.18 for a
CN domain, is greater than or equal to the value \"THRESHOLD\" of the
variable START\_THRESHOLD:

4\> delete the ciphering and integrity keys that are stored in the USIM
for that CN domain;

When entering GERAN *A/Gb mode* or CDMA2000 from GERAN *Iu mode*, RRC-
Connected mode (due to Inter-mode handover from GERAN or Inter-system
handover to CDMA2000), after successful completion of the procedure
causing the transition to the GERAN *A/Gb mode* or CDMA2000 from GERAN
*Iu mode*, the MS shall:

1\> if the USIM is present, for each CN domain:

2\> else

3\> after calculating the \"START\" value according to sub-clause
7.18.4, store the current \"START\" value for this CN domain in the MS.

### 7.18.3 Maintenance of Hyper Frame Numbers

The MSBs of both the ciphering sequence numbers (COUNT-C) and integrity
sequence numbers (COUNT-I), for the ciphering and integrity protection
algorithms, respectively (see 3GPPÂ TSÂ 33.102), are called the Hyper
Frame Numbers (HFN). For TM RLC bearers an extended TDMA frame number is
used, which is built by an HFN plus part of a TDMA frame number.

For integrity protection, the MS shall:

1\> maintain COUNT-I as specified in sub-clause 7.18.5;

The following hyper frame numbers types are defined:

1\> MAC HFN:\
11 MSB of COUNT-C for data sent over RLC TM

1\> RLC HFN:

2\> if the RLC sequence number is of length 7 bits(GPRS TBF mode, see
3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.160), then the HFN

3\> defines the 24 MSB of the COUNT-C parameter for data sent over RLC
UM, and

3\> defines the 24 MSB of the COUNT-C parameter for data sent over RLC
AM.

2\> if the RLC sequence number is of length 11bits ( EGPRS TBF mode, see
3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.160), then the HFN

3\> defines the 20 MSB of the COUNT-C parameter for data sent over RLC
UM, and

3\> defines the 20 MSB of the COUNT-C parameter for data sent over RLC
AM.

2\> if the RLC sequence number is of length 4 bits (DCCH TBF mode, see
3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.160), then the HFN

3\> defines the 27 MSB of the COUNT-C parameter for data sent over RLC
UM, and

3\> defines the 27 MSB of the COUNT-C parameter for data sent over RLC
AM.

2\> if the RLC sequence number is of length 8 bits (TCH TBF mode, see
3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.160), then the HFN

3\> defines the 23 MSB of the COUNT-C parameter for data sent over RLC
UM, and

3\> defines the 23 MSB of the COUNT-C parameter for data sent over RLC
AM.

2\> if the RLC sequence number is of length 10 bits (UDCH TBF mode, see
3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.160), then the HFN:

3\> defines the 21 MSB of the COUNT-C parameter for data sent over RLC
AM .

2\> if the RLC sequence number is of length 4 bits (UDCH TBF mode, see
3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.160), then the HFN:

3\> defines the 27 MSB of the COUNT-C parameter for data sent over RLC
UM.

2\> if the RLC sequence number is of length 4 bits (CDCH TBF mode, see
3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.160), then the HFN:

3\> defines the 27 MSB of the COUNT-C parameter for data sent over RLC
AM.

1\> RRC HFN:\
28 MSB of COUNT-I.

For non-transparent mode RLC radio bearers, the MS shall:

1\> maintain one uplink and one downlink COUNT-C per radio bearer and
one uplink and one downlink COUNT-I per signalling radio bearer.

For all transparent mode RLC signalling radio bearers and radio bearers
of the same CN domain, the MS shall:

1\> maintain one COUNT-C, common for all signalling radio bearers and
radio bearers in uplink and downlink;

1\> if the activation time for a new ciphering configuration set by an
RRC procedure is equal to zero:

2\> apply the configured MAC HFN at this activation time, i.e. the
configured HFN is not incremented;

1\> maintain one uplink and one downlink COUNT-I per signalling radio
bearer.

### 7.18.4 START value calculation

In RRC connected mode, if a Security Mode Command procedure has been
successfully completed for a CN domain during the current RRC
connection, the \"START\" value for that CN domain is calculated as

Let START~X~ = the \"START\" value for CN domain \'X\' prior to the
calculation below:

START~X~\' = MSB~20~ ( MAX {COUNT-C, COUNT-I \| radio bearers and
signalling radio bearers using CK~X~ and IK~X~}) + 2.

\- if START~X~\'= the maximum value = 20\^2 --1 = 1048575 then START~X~
= START~X~\';

\- if the current START~X~ \< START~X~\' then START~X~ = START~X~\',
otherwise START~X~ is unchanged.

NOTE: Here, \"most recently configured\" means that if there are more
than one key in use for a CN domain, due to non expiry of the ciphering
and/or integrity protection activation time for any signalling radio
bearers and/or radio bearers, do not include the COUNT-I/COUNT-C for
these signalling radio bearers and/or radio bearers in the calculation
of the START~X~\'.

COUNT-C corresponding to non-ciphered radio bearers (i.e. RBs with
ciphering status set to \"not started\") shall not be included in the
calculation of the START~X~\'. If a radio bearer is released and the
radio bearer was ciphered, the values of the COUNT-C at the time the
radio bearer is released shall be taken into account in the calculation
of the START~X~\'.

If a Security Mode Command procedure has not been successfully completed
for a CN domain during the current RRC connection, the MS shall use the
latest transmitted \"START\" value for this CN domain.

### 7.18.5 Integrity protection

#### 7.18.5.0 General

If the \"Status\" in the variable INTEGRITY\_ PROTECTION\_INFO has the
value \"Started\" then the MS and the GERAN shall:

1\> perform integrity protection (and integrity checking) on all RRC
messages, with the following exceptions:

RRC CONNECTION REJECT

RRC CONNECTION SETUP

RRC CONNECTION REQUEST

RRC CONNECTION SETUP COMPLETE

SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 5, 5bis, 5ter, 6

SYNCHRONIZATION CHANNEL INFORMATION

RRC STATUS

EXTENDED MEASUREMENT ORDER

EXTENDED MEASUREMENT REPORT

MEASURMENT REPORT

MEASUREMENT INFORMATION

ENHANCED MEASUREMENT REPORT

If the \"Status\" in the variable INTEGRITY\_ PROTECTION\_INFO has the
value \"Not started\" then integrity protection (and integrity checking)
shall not be performed on any RRC message.

For each signalling radio bearer, the MS shall use two RRC hyper frame
numbers:

1\> \"Uplink RRC HFN\";

1\> \"Downlink RRC HFN\".

and two message sequence numbers:

1\> \"Uplink RRC Message sequence number\";

1\> \"Downlink RRC Message sequence number\".

The above information is stored in the variable
INTEGRITY\_PROTECTION\_INFO per signalling radio bearer (RB1-RB4).

Upon the first activation of integrity protection for an RRC connection,
MS and GERAN initialise the \"Uplink RRC Message sequence number\" and
\"Downlink RRC Message sequence number\" for all signalling radio
bearers as specified in sub-clauses 7.18.5.2 and 7.18.5.1.

The RRC message sequence number (RRC SN) is incremented for every
integrity protected RRC message.

If the IE \"*Integrity Protection Mode Info*\" is present in a received
message, the MS shall:

1\> perform the actions in sub-clause 7.19.4.5 before proceeding with
the integrity check of the received message.

#### 7.18.5.1 Integrity protection in downlink

If the MS receives an RRC message on signalling radio bearer with RB
identity n, the \"Status\" in the variable INTEGRITY\_ PROTECTION\_INFO
has the value \"Started\" and the IE *\'Integrity Check Info*\' is
present the MS shall:

1\> check the value of the IE \"*RRC Message Sequence Number*\" included
in the IE \"*Integrity Check Info*\";

2\> if the \"Downlink RRC Message sequence number\" for signalling radio
bearer RBn is not present in the variable INTEGRITY\_PROTECTION\_INFO:

3\> initialise the \"Downlink RRC Message sequence number\" for
signalling radio bearer RBn in the variable INTEGRITY\_PROTECTION\_INFO
with the value of the IE \"*RRC Message Sequence Number*\" included in
the IE \"*Integrity Check Info*\" of the received message;

2\> if the \"Downlink RRC Message sequence number\" is present in the
variable INTEGRITY\_PROTECTION\_INFO:

3\> if the RRC message sequence number is lower than the \"Downlink RRC
Message sequence number\" for signalling radio bearer RBn in the
variable INTEGRITY\_PROTECTION\_INFO:

4\> increment \"Downlink RRC HFN\" for signalling radio bearer SRBn in
the variable INTEGRITY\_PROTECTION\_INFO with one.

NOTE: The actions above imply that also for the case the \"Downlink RRC
HFN\" is re-initialised by a security mode control procedure, this
\"Downlink RRC HFN\" value is incremented by one before it is applied
for the integrity protection of any received message if the conditions
above are fulfilled.

3\> if the RRC message sequence number is equal to the \"Downlink RRC
Message sequence number\" for signalling radio bearer RBn in the
variable INTEGRITY\_PROTECTION\_INFO:

4\> discard the message;

1\> calculate an expected message authentication code in accordance with
sub-clause 7.18.5.3;

1\> compare the expected message authentication code with the value of
the received IE \"*Message Authentication Code*\" contained in the IE
\"*Integrity* *Check Info*\";

2\> if the expected message authentication code and the received message
authentication code are the same, the integrity check is successful:

3\> update the \"Downlink RRC Message sequence number\" for signalling
radio bearer RBn in the variable INTEGRITY\_PROTECTION\_INFO with the
value of the IE \"*RRC* *Message Sequence Number*\" included in the IE
\"*Integrity Check Info*\" of the received RRC message;

2\> if the calculated expected message authentication code and the
received message authentication code differ:

3\> act as though the message was not received.

If the MS receives an RRC message on signalling radio bearer with
identity n, the \"Status\" in the variable INTEGRITY\_PROTECTION\_INFO
has the value \"Started\" and the IE *\'Integrity Check Info\'* is not
present the MS shall:

1\> discard the message.

#### 7.18.5.2 Integrity protection in uplink

Prior to sending an RRC message using the signalling radio bearer with
radio bearer identity n, and the \"Status\" in the variable
INTEGRITY\_PROTECTION\_INFO has the value \"Started\" the MS shall:

1\> increment \"Uplink RRC Message sequence number\" for signalling
radio bearer RBn in the variable INTEGRITY\_PROTECTION\_INFO with 1,
even if the message is a retransmission of a previously transmitted
message.

1\> if the \"Uplink RRC Message sequence number\" for signalling radio
bearer RBn in the variable INTEGRITY\_PROTECTION\_INFO equals zero :

2\> the MS shall increment \"Uplink RRC HFN\" for signalling radio
bearer RBn in the variable INTEGRITY\_PROTECTION\_INFO by one;

NOTE: The actions above imply that also for the case the \"Uplink RRC
HFN\" is re-initialised by a security mode control procedure, this
\"Uplink RRC HFN\" is incremented before it is applied in the integrity
protection of any transmitted message if the conditions above are
fulfilled.

1\> calculate the message authentication code in accordance with
sub-clause 7.18.5.3;

1\> replace the \"Message authentication code\" in the IE \"*Integrity
Check Info*\" in the message with the calculated message authentication
code;

1\> replace the \"RRC Message sequence number\" in the IE \"*Integrity
Check Info*\" in the message with contents set to the new value of the
\"Uplink RRC Message sequence number\" for signalling radio bearer RBn
in the variable INTEGRITY\_PROTECTION\_INFO;

In the response message for the procedure ordering the security
reconfiguration, the MS indicates the activation time, for each
signalling radio bearer. When the new integrity configuration is to be
applied in uplink, GERAN should then start to apply the new integrity
protection configuration according to the activation time for each
signalling radio bearer (except for the signalling radio bearer which is
used to send the message that is reconfiguring the security
configuration) where the new configuration is to be applied starting
from and including reception of the response message.

#### 7.18.5.3 Calculation of message authentication code

The MS shall calculate the message authentication code in accordance
with 3GPPÂ TSÂ 33.102. The construction of the input parameter MESSAGE
(see 3GPPÂ TSÂ 33.102) for the integrity algorithm is FFS.

For usage on an RRC message transmitted or received on the radio bearer
with identity n, the MS shall:

1\> construct the input parameter COUNT-I (see 3GPPÂ TSÂ 33.102) by
appending the following IEs from the IE \"*Signalling Radio Bearer
Specific Integrity Protection Information*\" for radio bearer n in the
variable INTEGRITY\_PROTECTION\_INFO:

2\> for uplink:

3\> \"Uplink RRC HFN\", as the MSB, and \"Uplink RRC Message sequence
number\", as LSB;

2\> for downlink:

3\> \"Downlink RRC HFN\", as the MSB, and the IE \"*RRC Message Sequence
Number*\" included in the IE \"*Integrity Check Info*\", as LSB.

### 7.18.6 Physical channel establishment

#### 7.18.6.0 General

![](media/image38.wmf){width="6.000694444444444in"
height="2.222916666666667in"}

FigureÂ 7.18.6.0.1: Handover Access procedure

The Handover Access procedure initiation in RRC-Cell\_Dedicated state is
done by sending a HANDOVER-Req primitive to the MS MAC layer as
described in 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.160. The MS MAC uses this procedure to initiate
access in the new cell. The reception of a HANDOVER ACCESS message at
GERAN MAC is indicated to GERAN RRC by sending the HANDOVER-Ind
primitive as specified in 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.160.

The Physical Information procedure initiation is done by sending a
PHYSICAL INFO-Req primitive to the GERAN MAC layer as specified in
3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.160 upon receipt of a HANDOVER-Ind primitive from the GERAN
MAC layer. When the network has the necessary mobile station\'s RF
characteristics it sends PHYSICAL INFORMATION message as specified in
sub-clause 7.18.6.2. The reception of a PHYSICAL INFORMATION message at
MS MAC is indicated to the MS RRC by sending the PHYSICAL INFO-Ind
primitive.

Four procedures are defined: Finely synchronized cell, Non-synchronized
cell, Pseudo-synchronized cell and Pre-synchronized cell. The support of
all of them except the pseudo-synchronized cell case is mandatory in the
mobile station. A pseudo-synchronized establishment can be commanded
only to a mobile station that can support it, as indicated in the
classmark.

#### 7.18.6.1 Finely synchronized cell case

When MS receives the RADIO BEARER RECONFIGURATION message and

1\> if the IE \"*Timing Advance*\"with the new cell is not out of range,
i.e. smaller than or equal to the maximum timing advance that can be
coded as specified in 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.004, or

1\> if the new cell does accept out of range timing advance as indicated
in the RADIO BEARER RECONFIGURATION message, the mobile station shall:

2\> after having switched to the assigned channels, send the HANDOVER
ACCESS message as specified in 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.160 The transmission of this
message is optional if so indicated by the network in the RADIO BEARER
RECONFIGURATION message.

The MS shall not transmit the HANDOVER ACCESS message in those cells
that support extended TA values if TA value in the new cell is greater
than 63 and the RADIO BEARER RECONFIGURATION message indicates that the
transmission of the HANDOVER ACCESS messages is optional.

Then the MS shall:

1\> activate the channels in sending and receiving mode.

If applicable, ciphering is immediately started.

#### 7.18.6.2 Non synchronized cell case

Upon reception of the RADIO BEARER RECONFIGURATION message and after
having switched to the assigned channels, the mobile station shall:

1\> send repeatedly the HANDOVER ACCESS message as specified in
3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.160;

1\> start timer T3124 at the start point of the timeslot in which the
HANDOVER ACCESS message is sent the first time;

1\> then, activate the channels in receiving mode; If applicable,
deciphering is then immediately started.

Upon receipt of a HANDOVER-ind primitive the GERAN RRC shall:

1\> set the value of the Timing Advance Value parameter in the PHYSICAL
INFO-Req primitive to the timing advance value received from the GERAN
MAC layer.

1\> initiate the transmission of PHYSICAL INFORMATION message by
transmitting a PHYSICAL INFO-Req service primitive to the GERAN MAC
sublayer.

When the network has the necessary mobile station\'s RF characteristics
it shall send aPHYSICAL INFORMATION message to the mobile station as
specified in 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.160. If applicable, ciphering and deciphering is
immediately started

The network shall start timer T3143 immediately after having sent the
PHYSICAL INFORMATION message. If this timer times out before the
reception of the RADIO BEARER RECONFIGURATION COMPLETE message from the
mobile station, the network shall send the PHYSICAL INFORMATION message
once more and shall restart timer T3143. The network shall not send the
PHYSICAL INFORMATION message more than N3143 times. The value of T3143
and N3143 is an implementation issue.

At the mobile side, when the MAC layer indicates the reception of a
PHYSICAL INFORMATION message, the MS shall:

1\> stop timer T3124;

1\> stop sending HANDOVER ACCESS messages;

1\> activate the physical channels in sending and receiving mode;

If the allocated channel is a DBPSCH/S, the performance of the mobile
station must enable the mobile station toaccept a correct PHYSICAL
INFORMATION message sent by the network in any block while T3124 is
running.

#### 7.18.6.3 Pseudo-synchronized cell case

The details of the use of this procedure are described in
3GPPÂ TSÂ 45.010.

If the RADIO BEARER RECONFIGURATION message is received by the MS and if
the IE \"*Timing Advance*\" and the IE \"*Real Time Difference*\" are
included in the message, then MS shall:

1\> compute the timing advance to be used with the new cell from the
real time difference value given in the RADIO BEARER RECONFIGURATION
message.

The mobile station shall switch to the new physical channel and proceed
as follows:

1\> if the \"*Timing Advance*\" IE is received in the RADIO BEARER
RECONFIGURATION; and

1\> if the mobile station knows that the timing advance with the new
cell is not out of range, i.e. smaller or equal to the maximum timing
advance that can be coded as specified in 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.004; or

1\> if the new cell accepts an out of range timing advance as indicated
in the RADIO BEARER RECONFIGURATION message after having switched to the
assigned channels, the mobile station shall:

2\> send the HANDOVER ACCESS message as specified in 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.160. The
transmission of this message is optional if so indicated by the network
in the RADIO BEARER RECONFIGURATION message.

The MS shall not transmit the HANDOVER ACCESS message in those cells
that support extended TA values if TA value in new cell is greater than
63 and the RADIO BEARER RECONFIGURATION message indicates that the
transmission of the HANDOVER ACCESS messages is optional.Then MS shall:

1\> activate the channels in sending and receiving mode while sending
the HANDOVER ACCESS message.

If applicable, ciphering is immediately started.

#### 7.18.6.4 Pre-synchronized cell case

The details of the use of this procedure are described in
3GPPÂ TSÂ 45.010.

Upon reception of the RADIO BEARER RECONFIGURATION message, the mobile
station shall:

1\> switch to the new channel; and

1\> send the HANDOVER ACCESS message as specified in 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.160. The
transmission of this message is optional if so indicated by the network
in the RADIO BEARER RECONFIGURATION message.

The MS shall not transmit the HANDOVER ACCESS message in those cells
that support extended TA values if TA value in new cell is greater than
63 and the RADIO BEARER RECONFIGURATION message indicates that the
transmission of the HANDOVER ACCESS messages is optional.Then MS shall
activate the channels in sending and receiving mode during the
transmission of the HANDOVER ACCESS message.The timing advance value to
be used with the new cell is:

1\> either the value contained in the RADIO BEARER RECONFIGURATION
message if the timing advance information element is present; or

1\> the default value for pre-synchronized handover as defined in
3GPPÂ TSÂ 45.010, if the timing advance information element is not
included in the RADIO BEARER RECONFIGURATION message. The MS may
activate the channels in receiving mode while sendingHANDOVER ACCESS
message.

If applicable, ciphering is immediately started.

### 7.18.7 (void)

### 7.18.8 Link failure and Radio link failure criteria and actions upon link or radio link failure

When a radio link failure is detected at L2, it is notified to RRC as
specified in 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.160.

When a link failure is reported by a given RLC entity to RRC, RRC shall:

1\> stop the RLC entity

When a radio link failure occurs signalled by the MAC sublayer or the
physical layer (see 3GPPÂ TSÂ 45.008), the MS shall:

1\> clear the dedicated physical channel configuration;

1\> perform actions as specified for the ongoing procedure;

1\> if no procedure is ongoing or no actions are specified for the
ongoing procedure:

2\> perform a Cell Update procedure according to sub-clause 7.8 using
the cause \"radio link failure\".

### 7.18.9 Unsupported configuration

The MS should set the variable UNSUPPORTED\_CONFIGURATION to TRUE if the
received message is not according to the MS capabilities.

### 7.18.10 Invalid RLC/MAC control message notification

When notification is received of the reception of an invalid RLC/MAC
acknowledgement message on DBPSCH, the MS shall:

1\> re-establish all RLC entities for the radio bearers currently
established on the DBPSCH(s);

1\> clear the dedicated physical channel configuration;

1\> perform actions as specified for the ongoing procedure;

1\> if no procedure is ongoing or no actions are specified for the
ongoing procedure:

2\> perform a Cell Update procedure according to sub-clause 7.8 using
the cause \"Invalid RLC/MAC control message\"

### 7.18.11 Actions related to Radio Bearer mapping

When the MS receives the IE \"*RB Mapping Info*\" and/or the IE
\"*Transport Format Set*\", when the MS performs a cell reselection or a
state transition, or when the MS releases a RB, the MS shall for each of
the configured Radio Bearers:

1\> configure the MAC with the appropriate transport format set (with
computed transport block sizes) for the transport channel used by that
RB;

1\> determine the sets of RLC sizes that apply to the RLC entity used by
that RB, based on the IE \"*RLC Size List*\" included in the applicable
\"Transport format set\" (either the ones received in the same message
or the ones stored if none were received);

1\> if that RB is using RLC AM and the RLC size list applicable to the
RLC entity transporting data PDUs is different from the one derived from
the previously stored configuration:

2\> if the old RLC size list is not contained in the new one then:

3\> re-establish the RLC entity;

3\> configure the corresponding RLC entity with the new RLC size list;

2\> else configure the corresponding RLC entity with the new RLC size
list;

2\> for each RLC AM radio bearer in the CN domain as indicated in the IE
*\"CN Domain Identity*\" in the IE \"*RAB Info*\" in the variable
ESTABLISHED\_RABS whose RLC size is changed; and

2\> for each RLC AM signalling radio bearer in the CN domain as
indicated in the IE \"*CN Domain Identity*\" in the variable
LATEST\_CONFIGURED\_CN\_DOMAIN whose RLC size is changed:

3\> if the IE \"*Status*\" in the variable CIPHERING\_STATUS of this CN
domain is set to \"Started\":

4\> set the HFN values for the corresponding RLC entity equal to the
value of the IE \"*START*\" for this CN domain that will be included in
the CELL UPDATE message following cell reselection.

4\> if the RLC re-establishment is caused by a CELL UPDATE CONFIRM:

5\> set the HFN values for the corresponding RLC entity equal to the
value of the IE \"*START*\" included in the latest transmitted CELL
UPDATE message for this CN domain.

4\> if the RLC re-establishment is caused by a reconfiguration message:

5\> set the HFN values for the corresponding RLC entity equal to the
value of the IE \"*START*\" that will be included in the reconfiguration
complete message for this CN domain.

1\> if that RB is using RLC UM:

2\> indicate the largest applicable RLC size to the corresponding RLC
entity.

1\> configure the MAC with the set of applicable RLC Sizes for each of
the RLC entity used for that RB;

1\> if there is no RLC information applicable for the transport channels
to be used:

2\> set the variable INVALID\_CONFIGURATION to TRUE.

### 7.18.12 Network response times for DBPSCH allocation

Upon reception of a CELL UPDATE CONFIRM message or one of the radio
bearer reconfiguration messages (RADIO BEARER SETUP or RADIO BEARER
RECONFIGURATION or RADIO BEARER RELEASE message) by the MS, and if the
IE \"*DBPSCH Description*\" and the structure \"Network Response Times\"
are included, the MS shall set the response times for layer 2 as
specified in 3GPP TS 44.160.

value of the IE \"*Signalling Connection Release Indication*\" to the
upper layers;

2\> remove the signalling connection identified with the value of the IE
\"*Signalling Connection Release Indication*\" from the variable
ESTABLISHED\_SIGNALLING\_CONNECTIONS;

1\> if radio access bearers for the CN domain identified with the value
of the IE \"*Signalling Connection Release Indication*\" would remain in
the variable ESTABLISHED\_RABS after processing of the received message:

2\> set the variable INVALID\_CONFIGURATION to TRUE.

### 7.19.3 GERAN mobility information elements

#### 7.19.3.1 GRA identity

The MS shall:

1\> if the IE \"*GRA Identity*\" is included in a received message:

2\> if the IE \"*RRC State Indicator*\" is included and set to
\"GRA\_PCH\":

3\> store this GRA identity in the variable GRA\_IDENTITY;

3\> after sending a possible message to GERAN and entering GRA\_PCH
state as specified elsewhere, read packet system information 16 in the
selected cell;

3\> if the stored GRA identity in the variable GRA\_IDENTITY is not
included in the list of GRA identities in System Information 16 in the
selected cell, the list of GRA identities in system information 16 is
empty or if the packet system information 16 can not be found, a
confirmation error of GRA identity list has occurred:

4\> if no GRA Update procedure is ongoing:

state as specified elsewhere, read System Information 16 in the selected
cell;

3\> if System Information 16 in the selected cell contains a single GRA
identity:

of the specification:

1\> ignore the contents of this IE.

### 7.19.4 MS information elements

#### 7.19.4.1 Activation time

If the MS receives a message containing the IE \"*Activation time*\"
with a value other than 0, the MS shall:

1\> select the beginning of the FN (TDMA Frame Number) indicated by the
IE \"*Activation Time*\" as the activation time T.

1\> at the activation time T:

2\> for a physical channel reconfiguration caused by the received
message:

3\> release the physical channel configuration, which was present before
T;

3\> initiate the establishment of the physical channel configuration as
specified for the physical channel information elements in the received
message as specified elsewhere.

2\> for actions, other than a physical channel reconfiguration, caused
by the received message:

3\> perform the actions for the information elements in the received
message as specified elsewhere.

If the MS receives a message containing the IE \"*Activation time*\"
with the value 0 meaning \"Now\", the MS shall:

1\> as an immediate reaction to the reception of the message (see
3GPPÂ TSÂ 45.010 for timing constraints):

2\> perform the actions for the information elements in the received
message as specified elsewhere,

NOTE: If the MS was in RRC-Idle mode or RRC- CELL\_Shared state upon
reception of the message, and the value of the IE \"*Activation Time*\"
in the received message is different from \"Now\", regardless of the
state the MS enters after reception of the message the MS behaviour is
unspecified.

#### 7.19.4.2 DRX parameters

##### 7.19.4.2.1 CN domain specific DRX cycle length coefficients

**The GERAN shall broadcast the** CN domain specific DRX cycle length
coefficients **parameter on PBCCH.** The MS may be attached to different
CN domains with different CN domain specific DRX cycle lengths. The MS
shall store each CN domain specific DRX cycle length for each CN domain
the MS is attached to.

For the CS CN domain, the CS CN specific DRX cycle length coefficient
shall be updated locally in the MS using information given in system
information.

For the PS CN domain, the PS CN specific DRX cycle length coefficient
may be updated after indication by the MS to the PS CN in NAS procedure.
If no specific value is indicated, the MS and PS CN shall use the DRX
cycle length given for PS CN domain in system information.

NOTE: Broadcast of CN domain specific DRX cycle length coefficients
shall be introduced with System Information broadcasting for GERAN *Iu
mode*.

##### 7.19.4.2.2 GERAN DRX cycle length coefficient

In RRC-Connected mode, GERAN shall determine and it may **send its**
GERAN specific DRX cycle length coefficients **parameter to a given MS**
in the following RRC messages:

\- CELL UPDATE CONFIRM

\- GRA UPDATE CONFIRM

\- RADIO BEARER RECONFIGURATION

\- RADIO BEARER RELEASE

\- RADIO BEARER SETUP

\- RRC CONNECTION SETUP

##### 7.19.4.2.3 Paging Group

In DRX mode, the MS shall compute its paging group and the GERAN shall
compute a paging group listened by the MS (see 3GPPÂ TSÂ 23.122) using the
SPLIT\_PG\_CYCLE parameter obtained with the following equation:

SPLIT\_PG\_CYCLE = 3 x 2 ^(9-\"main\ DRX\ cycle\ length\ coefficient\")^

In RRC-Idle mode, the \"main DRX cycle length coefficient\" is:

1\> for the MS, the smallest of the stored CN domain specific DRX cycle
length coefficients corresponding to the CN domains to which the MS is
attached;

1\> for the GERAN, the smallest of:

2\> the broadcast CN domain specific DRX cycle length coefficients
corresponding to the CN domains to which the MS is attached, and

2\> the DRX cycle length coefficient, if indicated in the PAGING message
received via RANAP.

In RRC-Connected mode, the \"main DRX cycle length coefficient\" is:

1\> for the MS, the smallest of:

2\> the stored CN domain specific DRX cycle length coefficients
corresponding to the CN domains to which the MS is attached, and,

2\> the GERAN DRX cycle length coefficient, if previously received.

1\> for the GERAN, the smallest of:

2\> the broadcast CN domain specific DRX cycle length coefficients
corresponding to the CN domains to which the MS is attached,

2\> the GERAN DRX cycle length coefficient, if previously received, and

2\> the DRX cycle length coefficient, if indicated in the PAGING message
received via RANAP.

The paging group is indicated to lower layers via primitives.

NOTE: Primitives between RLC/MAC and RRC shall be described in
3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.160.

#### 7.19.4.3 Generic state transition rules depending on received information elements

The IE \"*RRC State Indicator*\" indicates the state the MS shall enter.
The MS shall enter the state indicated by the IE \"*RRC State
Indicator*\" even if the received message includes other IEs relevant
only for states other than indicated by the IE \"*RRC State
Indicator*\". E.g. if the RRC state indicator is set to
\"RRC-Cell\_Shared\" while other IEs provide information about a
configuration including dedicated channels, the MS shall enter
RRC-Cell\_Shared state. If however the MS has no information about the
configuration corresponding to the state indicated by the IE \"*RRC
State Indicator*\", it shall consider the requested configuration as
invalid.

The MS shall, if the IE \"*RRC State Indicator*\" in the received
message has the value:

1\> \"RRC-Cell\_Shared\":

2\> enter RRC-Cell\_Shared state as dictated by the procedure governing
the message received;

1\> \"RRC-CELL\_Dedicated\":

2\> if neither DBPSCH is assigned in the message nor is the MS is
RRCRRC-CELL\_Dedicated state:

3\> set the variable INVALID\_CONFIGURATION to TRUE;

2\> else:

3\> enter RRC-Cell\_Dedicated state as dictated by the procedure
governing the message received;

1\> \"RRC-GRA\_PCH\":

2\> if the received message is RRC CONNECTION SETUP and IE \"*RRC State
Indicator*\" is set to RRC-GRA\_PCH:

3\> set the variable INVALID\_CONFIGURATION to TRUE;

2\> else:

3\> enter RRC-GRA\_PCH state as dictated by the procedure governing the
message received.

#### 7.19.4.4 Ciphering mode info

The IE \"*Ciphering Mode Info*\" defines the new ciphering
configuration. At any given time, the MS needs to store at most two
different ciphering configurations (keyset and algorithm) per CN domain
at any given time in total for all radio bearers, and three
configurations in total for all signalling radio bearers.

If the IE \"*Ciphering Mode Info*\" is present and if the IE
\"*Reconfiguration*\" in the variable CIPHERING\_STATUS is set to TRUE,
the MS shall:

1\> ignore this attempt to change the ciphering configuration; and

1\> set the variable INCOMPATIBLE\_SECURITY\_CONFIGURATION to TRUE.

If the IE \"*Ciphering Mode Info*\" is present and if the IE
\"*Reconfiguration*\" in the variable CIPHERING\_STATUS is set to FALSE,
the MS shall:

1\> if none of the IE \"*Status*\" in the variable CIPHERING STATUS has
the value \"Started\", and this IE \"*Ciphering Mode Info*\" was
included in a message that is not the message SECURITY MODE COMMAND
message; or

1\> if the IE \"*Ciphering Mode Info*\" was received in the message
SECURITY MODE COMMAND message and there does not exist exactly one
ciphering activation time in the IE \"*Radio Bearer Downlink Ciphering
Activation Time Info*\" for each established RLC-AM and RLC-UM radio
bearers included in the IE \"*RB Information*\" in the ESTABLISHED\_RABS
for the CN domain as indicated in the variable
LATEST\_CONFIGURED\_CN\_DOMAIN; or

1\> if the IE \"*Ciphering Mode Info*\" was received in the message
SECURITY MODE COMMAND message and the IE \"*Ciphering Activation Time
for DBPSCH*\" is not included in the message, and there exist radio
bearers using RLC-TM according to the IE \"*RB Information*\" in the IE
\"ESTABLISHED\_RABS\" for the CN domain as indicated in the variable
LATEST\_CONFIGURED\_CN\_DOMAIN; or

1\> if the IE \"*Ciphering Mode Info*\" was received in the message
SECURITY MODE COMMAND message and there does not exist excactly one
ciphering activation time in the IE \"*Radio Bearer Downlink Ciphering
Activation Time Info*\" for each established signalling radio bearer
included in the IE \"*Signalling Radio Bearer Information*\" in the
ESTABLISHED-RABS;

2\> ignore this attempt to change the ciphering configuration;

2\> set the variable INVALID\_CONFIGURATION to TRUE;

2\> perform the actions as specified in sub-clause 7.16.1.2.6;

If the IE \"*Ciphering Mode Info*\" is present and if the IE
*\"Reconfiguration*\" in the variable CIPHERING\_STATUS is set to FALSE,
the MS shall:

1\> set the IE \"*Reconfiguration*\" in the variable CIPHERING\_STATUS
to TRUE;

1\> set the IE \"*Status*\" in the variable CIPHERING\_STATUS of the the
CN domains for which the IE \"*Status*\" of the variable
SECURITY\_MODIFICATION is set to \"Affected\" to \"Started\";

1\> apply the new ciphering configuration in the lower layers for all
RBs that belong to a CN domain for which the IE \"*Status*\" of the
variable SECURITY\_MODIFICATION is set to \"Affected\" and all
signalling radio bearers:

2\> using the ciphering algorithm (UEA (see 3GPPÂ TSÂ 33.102)) indicated
by the IE \"*Ciphering Algorithm*\" as part of the new ciphering
configuration;

2\> for each radio bearer that belongs to a CN domain for which the IE
\"*Status*\" of the variable SECURITY\_MODIFICATION is set to
\"Affected\" and all signalling radio bearers:

3\> use the value of the IE \"*RB Identity*\" in the variable
ESTABLISHED\_RABS minus one as the value of BEARER (see 3GPPÂ TSÂ 33.102)
in the ciphering algorithm;

1\> for the downlink and the uplink, the new ciphering configuration
shall be applied as follows:

2\> if the ciphering configuration for a radio bearer or signalling
radio bearer from a previously received SECURITY MODE COMMAND message
has not yet been applied because of the corresponding activaton times
not having been reached and the current received message includes the IE
\"*Downlink Counter Synchronization Info*\" or the current received
message is a RADIO BEARER RECONFIGURATION message and includes the IE
\"*New G-RNTI*\":

3\> if the previous SECURITY MODE COMMAND message was received due to
new keys being received:

4\> consider the new ciphering configuration to include the received new
keys;

3\> else if the previous SECURITY MODE COMMAND caused a change in
LATEST\_CONFIGURED\_CN\_DOMAIN

4\> consider the new ciphering configuration to include the keys
associated with the LATEST\_CONFIGURED\_CN\_DOMAIN;

2\> apply the new ciphering configuration in uplink and downlink
immediately following RLC re-establishment.

2\> if the IE \"*Ciphering Activation Time for DBPSCH*\" is present in
the IE \"*Ciphering Mode Info*\" and the MS was in Cell\_Dedicated state
prior to this procedure:

3\> for radio bearers using RLC-TM:

4\> apply the old ciphering configuration for the TDMA frame number less
than the number indicated by the IE \"*COUNT-C activation time*\" in the
IE \"*Ciphering Activation Time for DBPSCH*\";

4\> apply the new ciphering configuration for the TDMA frame number
greater than or equal to the number indicated in IE \"*Ciphering
Activation Time for DBPSCH*\";

2\> if the IE \"*Radio Bearer Downlink Ciphering Activation Time Info*\"
is present:

3\> apply the following procedure for each radio bearer and signalling
radio bearers using RLC-AM or RLC-UM indicated by the IE \"*RB
Identity*\":

4\> suspend uplink transmission on the radio bearer or the signalling
radio bearer (except for the SRB where the response message is
transmitted) according to the following:

5\> do not transmit RLC PDUs with sequence number greater than or equal
to the uplink activation time, where the uplink activation time is
seclected according to the rules below;

4\> select an \"RLC sequence number\" at which (activation) time the new
ciphering configuration shall be applied in uplink for that radio bearer
according to the following:

5\> consider an ciphering activation time in uplink to be pending until
the RLC sequence number of the next RLC PDU to be transmitted for the
first time is equal to or larger than the selected activation time;

5\> for each radio bearer and signalling radio bearer that has no
pending ciphering activation time in the uplink as set by a previous
procedure changing the security configuration:

> 6\> set a suitable value that would ensure a minimised delay in the
> change to the latest ciphering configuration;

5\> for each radio bearer and signalling radio bearer that has a pending
ciphering activation time in uplink as set by a previous procedure
changing the security configuration:

> 6\> for radio bearers and signalling radio bearers except SRB2, set
> the same value as the pending ciphering activation time;

4\> store the selected \"RLC send sequence number\" for that radio
bearer in the entry for the radio bearer in the variable
RB\_UPLINK\_CIPHERING\_ACTIVATION\_TIME\_INFO;

4\> switch to the new ciphering configuration according to the
following:

5\> use the old ciphering configuration for the transmitted and received
RLC PDUs with RLC sequence number smaller than the corresponding RLC
sequence number indicated in the IE \"*Radio Bearer Uplink Ciphering
Activation Time Info*\" sent to GERAN and the received IE \"*Radio
Bearer Downlink Ciphering Activation Time Info*\" received from GERAN,
respectively;

5\> use the new ciphering configuration for the transmitted and received
RLC PDUs with RLC sequence numbers greater than or equal to the
corresponding RLC sequence number indicated in the IE \"*Radio Bearer
Uplink Ciphering Activation Time Info*\" sent to GERAN and in the
received IE \"*Radio Bearer Downlink Ciphering Activation Time Info*\"
received from GERAN, respectively;

5\> for a radio bearer using RLC-AM, when the RLC sequence number
indicated in the IE \"*Radio Bearer Downlink Ciphering Activation Time
Info*\" falls below the RLC receiving window and the RLC sequence number
indicated in the IE \"*Radio Bearer Uplink Ciphering Activation Time
Info*\" falls below the RLC transmission window, the MS may release the
old ciphering configuration for that radio bearer;

5\> if an RLC reset or re-establishment occurs before the activation
time for the new ciphering configuration has been reached, ignore the
activation time and apply the new ciphering configuration both in uplink
and downlink immediately after the RLC reset or RLC re-establishment.

If the IE \"*Ciphering Mode Info*\" is not present, the MS shall:

1\> for the downlink and the uplink, apply the ciphering configuration
as follows:

2\> if the ciphering configuration for a AM or UM radio bearer or
signalling radio bearer from a previously received SECURITY MODE COMMAND
has not yet been applied because of the corresponding activation times
not having been reached and the current received message includes the IE
\"*DL Counter Synch Info*\" or the current received message is a RADIO
BEARER RECONFIGURATION message and includes the IE \"*New G-RNTI*\":

3\> if the previous SECURITY MODE COMMAND was received due to new keys
being received:

4\> consider the ciphering configuration to include the received new
keys;

3\> else if the previous SECURITY MODE COMMAND caused a change in
LATEST\_CONFIGURED\_CN\_DOMAIN:

4\> consider the ciphering configuration to include the keys associated
with the LATEST\_CONFIGURED\_CN\_DOMAIN;

3\> apply the ciphering configuration in uplink and downlink immediately
following RLC re-establishment;

2\> else:

3\> not change the ciphering configuration.

#### 7.19.4.5 Integrity protection mode info

##### 7.19.4.5.1 General

The IE \"*Integrity Protection Mode Info\"* defines the new integrity
protection configuration. At any given time, the MS needs to store at
most three different integrity protection configurations (keysets) in
total for all signalling radio bearers for all CN domains.

If the IE \"*Integrity Protection Mode Info*\" is present and if the IE
\"*Reconfiguration*\" in the variable INTEGRITY\_PROTECTION\_INFO is set

1\> if the IE \"*Starting Time*\" is present and the IE \"*Channel
Description, Before The Starting Time*\" indicates frequency hopping,
and none of the above mentioned IE is present,

2\> the IE\"*Frequency List, After Time*\" must be present, and this
applies also for before the starting time.

2\> if frequency hopping is applied, the cell allocation if present in
the message is used to decode the mobile allocation. If the cell
allocation is not included, the mobile station shall use its current
cell allocation.

1\> if the RADIO BEARER RECONFIGURATION message contains only the IE
\"*Description of the Channel, After Time*\" and the handover is towards
a GERAN cell to which the mobile station is not synchronised for the
case of an intersystem handover to GERAN, the mobile station shall:

2\> wait up to the starting time before accessing the new channel;

2\> if the starting time has already elapsed, the mobile shall:

3\> access the new channel as an immediate reaction to the reception of
the message (see 3GPPÂ TSÂ 45.010 for the timing constraints). Between the
reception of the RADIO BEARER RECONFIGURATION and the starting time
there is no requirement for the mobile station to receive or transmit on
the old channel.

If MS receives the RADIO BEARER RECONFIGURATION and the IE \"*Power
Command and Access Type*\" is present, the MS shall:

1\> set the initial power on the new channel (s) to the the power level
defined in this power command (cf 3GPPÂ TSÂ 45.008). It shall not affect
the power used on the old channel(s).

else

1\> set the variable INVALID\_CONFIGURATION to TRUE.

If MS receives the RADIO BEARER RECONFIGURATION and if the IE
\"*Handover Reference*\" is present, the MS shall:

If MS receives the RADIO BEARER RECONFIGURATION and if the IE
\"*Synchronization Indication*\" is not be present then, the MS shall:

1\> assume the handover type is non-synchronized.

If MS receives the RADIO BEARER RECONFIGURATION and if the IE
\"*Timining Advance*\" is present then the MS shall:

1\> use this in the new cell;

1\> if in the case of a synchronous or pseudo-synchronous handover the
MS knows that the timing advance with the new cell is out of range, i.e.
is bigger than the maximum timing advance that can be coded as specified
in 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.004, and if the new cell does not accept out of range
timing advance as indicated in the RADIO BEARER RECONFIGURATION message,
the mobile station shall:

2\> set the variable INVALID\_CONFIGURATION to TRUE.

If the mobile station receives a RADIO BEARER RECONFIGURATION message
and if at least one of the following IEs, IE \"*Handover Reference*\",
IE \"*Power Command and Access Type*\", IE \"*Cell Description*\" and IE
\"*Description of the first channel after time*\" is not present, the MS
shall:

1\> set the variable INVALID\_CONFIGURATION to TRUE.

If the MS receives RADIO BEARER RECONFIGURATION and the IE \"*Starting
Time*\" may be present, then the MS shall:

1\> change the frequency paramters of the channels more or less at the
moment a change of channel occurs. In this case a number of parameters
can be included.

If the MS receives RADIO BEARER RECONFIGURATION and if the IE
\"*Starting Time*\" is present and none of the information elements
referring to before the starting time are present, the mobile station
shall:

1\> wait and access the channels at the indicated time.

If the MS receives RADIO BEARER RECONFIGURATION and if the IE
\"*Starting Time*\" is present and at least one of the information
elements referring to before the starting time is present, the mobile
station shall:

1\> not wait for the indicated time and access the channel using the
frequency parameters for before the starting time.

If the MS receives RADIO BEARER RECONFIGURATION and if the IE
\"*Starting Time*\" is not present and some of the information elements
referring to before the starting time are present, these information
elements shall be considered as IEs unnecessary in the message.

If the MS receives RADIO BEARER RECONFIGURATION and if the IE
\"*Description of the First Channel, Before Time*\" is not present, the
MS shall:

1\> apply for the channel description the information given for before
the time, if needed, in the IE \"*Description of tThe First Channel,
After Time\"*.

If the MS receives RADIO BEARER RECONFIGURATION and if the IE
\"*Description of the Second Channel, After Time*\" is present, and if
the IE \"*Description of the* *Second Channel, Before Time*\" not
present, and a description of the configuration for before the time
needed, the MS shall:

1\> use the channel configuration before the starting time, and the
channel description to apply to the second channel before the starting
time is given by the IE \"*Description of the Second Channel, After
Time*\".

If the MS receives RADIO BEARER RECONFIGURATION and if the IE
\"*Starting Time\"* is present and at least one of the channel
descriptions for before the starting time indicates frequency hopping,
one and only one of the following information elements may be present
and applies before the starting time to all assigned channels:

\- IE \"*Mobile Allocation, Before Time*\";

\- IE \"*Frequency Short List, Before Time*\";

If the IE \"*Starting Time*\" is present and at least one of the channel
descriptions for before the starting time indicates frequency hopping,
and if none of the above mentioned IE is present, the MS shall use:

1\> a frequency list for after the starting time must be present, and
this list applies also for the channels before the starting time.

If MS receives the RADIO BEARER RECONFIGURATION and if at least one of
the channel descriptions for after time indicates frequency hopping, one
and only one of the following information elements shall be present IE
\"*Frequency Channel Sequence, After Time\",* IE *\"Frequency List,
After Time\",* IE *\"Frequency Short List, After Time\",* IE*\"Mobile
Allocation, After Time*\".

If MS receives the RADIO BEARER RECONFIGURATION and if neither of the
*Channel Description* IEs indicate frequency hopping, and if they are
not required for the decoding of *Channel Description* IEs for before
time, and if any of the four information elements are present they shall
be considered as IEs unnecessary in the message.

The IE *\"Frequency Channel Sequence*\" element shall not be used unless
all the ARFCNs that it indicates are in the P-GSMÂ band.

If the RADIO BEARER RECONFIGURATION message instructs the mobile station
to use a frequency that it is not capable of, then the mobile station
shall:

1\> set the variable UNSUPPORTED\_CONFIGURATION to TRUE;

1\> remain on the current channel(s).

If the mobile station receives a RADIO BEARER RECONFIGURATION message
with a IE \"*Frequency List*\" or IE \"*Frequency Short List*\"
indicating frequencies that are not all in one band, then the mobile
station shall:

1\> stay on the current channel(s); and

1\> set the variable UNSUPPORTED\_CONFIGURATION to TRUE.

If MS receives the one of the messages RADIO BEARER SETUP, RADIO BEARER
RECONFIGURATION, RADIO BEARER RELEASE or CELL UPDATE CONFIRM message and
if the IE \"*Frequency List, After Time*\" or IE \"*Frequency List,
Before Time*\" is present, then MS shall:

1\> change the frequency according with the values of the IEs.

If the MS receives the reconfiguration message and if IE \"*Cell Channel
Description*\" is present in the message and if the frequency hopping is
applied, the MS may decode the mobile alocation based on the cell
allocation, if present in the message.

The network shall include the IE \"*Cell Channel Description*\" in the
RADIO BEARER RECONFIGURATION, RADIO BEARER SETUP, RADIO BEARER RELEASE
or CELL UPDATE CONFIRM message if no proper reference cell frequency
list (CA) has been sent previously to the mobile station.

If MS receives in the RADIO BEARER RECONFIGURATION message which
contains the \"*Cell Channel Description*\" IE or \"*Channel Mode*\" IE
which instruct the mobile station to use a Channel Description or Mode
that it does not support, or the Channel Mode indicated for use is not
defined for all channel sets, then the MS shall:

1\> set the variable UNSUPPORTED\_CONFIGURATION to TRUE

1\> remain on the current channel(s) and use the old Channel Description
or Mode(s).

If the cell allocation is not included, the mobile station shall use its
current cell allocation, the current CA is the last CA received. If the
mobile station receives RADIO BEARER RECONFIGURATION message with a IE
\"*Mobile Allocation*\" indexing frequencies that are not all in one
band and a IE *Starting Time* indicating a time that has not elapsed
then the mobile station shall:

1\> remain on the current channel(s).

1\> send a RRC STATUS message with cause \"frequency not implemented\";

1\> set the variable INVALID\_CONFIGURATION to TRUE.

If the mobile station receives a RADIO BEARER RECONFIGURATION message
with a IE \"Mobile Allocation\" indexing frequencies that are not all in
one band and a \"Starting Time\" IE indicating a time that has elapsed,
then the mobile station shall locally abort the radio connection and, if
permitted, attempt Call Re-establishment.

If the MS receives the RADIO BEARER RECONFIGURATION message and if IE
\"*Cell Description*\" is included in the message then MS shall:

1\> use its pre-knowledge about synchronization acquired by the
measurement process (i.e. BSIC + BCCH frequency)

else

\"*Timing Advance*\" is included then the MS shall:

1\> if IE \"*Synchronization Indication*\" indicates a presynchronized
handover, use presynchronous type of handover.

1\> else

2\> if IE \"*Synchronization Indication*\" not indicates a
presynchronized handover, use the default value as defined in
3GPPÂ TSÂ 45.010. The MS shall consider an unnecessary information element
for other types of handover.

The \"*Dynamic ARFCN\"* IE shall only be included if the network
supports dynamic ARFCN mapping and there is a need to define new dynamic
ARFCN mapping, e.g. at handover to another PLMN or from another RAT to
GSM. This information replaces any previously received information about
dynamic ARFCN mapping. After returning to idle mode or packet idle mode,
the mobile station shall acquire new dynamic ARFCN mapping information,
except for the cases specified in 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.018 (SI15). This mapping
shall apply to any ARFCN used in the RADIO BEARER RECONFIGURATION
message.

When one of the reconfiguration messages or CELL UPDATE CONFIRM message
is received and IE \"*PDTCH*\" is included, the MS shall

1\> set the structure \"Dynamic Allocation\" as specified in

RECONFIGURATION, RADIO BEARER RELEASE or CELL UPDATE CONFIRM messages
and if the structure \"*FLO Basic Physical Channels Parameters*\" is
present in the IE \"*DBPSCH*\"and none of the IE \"*Mode\",* IE
\"*Modulation*\" and IE \"*Interleaving*\" is present then the MS shall:

configuration not supported, the MS shall:

1\> set the variable INVALID\_CONFIGURATION to TRUE.

#### 7.19.6.2 SBPSCH parameters

The reconfiguration message can contain either the description of the
uplink TBF or the downlink TBF. The information on the power to be used
on the target TBF shall not affect the power used on the old channel(s).
The network may assign a radio resource on one or more PDCHs to be used
for the TBF. The amount of radio resource to be reserved is a network
dependent choice.

The IE \"*SBPSCH Description*\" message may indicate a frequency change
in progress, with a starting time and possibly alternative channel
descriptions.

1\> if the starting time has already elapsed, the mobile shall:

2\> use the TBF immediatly after the reception of the message (see
3GPPÂ TSÂ 45.010 for the timing constraints).

1\> if the message contains both the description of a TBF to be used
after the indicated time and of a TBF to be used before, the mobile
station shall:

2\> use the TBF as an immediate reaction to the reception of the
message.

1\> if the moment the mobile station is ready to access is before the
indicated time, the mobile station shall:

2\> use the TBF described for before the starting time.

2\> the mobile station shall then change to the TBF described for after
the starting time at the indicated time. New parameters shall be

after the starting time.

### 7.19.7 Transport channel information elements

#### 7.19.7.1 Transport Format Set

If the IE \"*Transport Format Set*\" is included, the MS shall:

1\> if that RB is using AM and the set of RLC sizes applicable to the
RLC entity transferring data PDUs has more than one element not equal to
zero:

2\> keep the transport format set if this exists for that transport
channel;

2\> set the variable INVALID\_CONFIGURATION to TRUE.

1\> if the total number of configured transport formats for the
transport channel exceeds maxTF:

2\> keep the transport format set if this exists for that transport
channel;

2\> set the variable INVALID\_CONFIGURATION to TRUE.

1\> if the IE \"*Transport Format Set*\" is considered as valid
according to the rules above:

2\> remove a previously stored transport format set if this exists for
that transport channel;

2\> store the transport format set for that transport channel;

2\> if the IE \"*Transport format Set*\" has the choice \"Transport
channel type\" set to \"Dedicated transport channel\":

3\> calculate the transport block size for all transport formats in the
TFS using the following

TB size = RLC/MAC block size if \"RLC size\" \<\> 0,\
TB size = 0 if \"RLC size\" = 0,

where:

\- RLC/MAC block size is calculated according to 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.160.

\- \'RLC size\' reflects the RLC PDU size.

2\> if the IE \"*Transport Format Set*\" contains IE \"*Semi-static
Transport Format Information*\" then:

3\> set the values of CRC size to 0,6,12 or 18 and the Rate matching
attribute any value between 1 and 256.

2\> else:

3\> set the variable INVALID\_CONFIGURATION to TRUE.

2\> if the *Transport Block Size* \<\> 0 and IE \"*RLC size*\" = 0, no
RLC PDU data exists but only parity bits exist for that transport
format;

2\> if the *Transport Block Size* = 0, neither RLC PDU neither data nor
parity bits exist for that transport format;

1.  perform the actions as specified in sub-clause 7.18.21.

#### 7.19.7.2 Transport format combination set

1\> store the new transport format combination set, or (if this exists)
modify a previously stored transport format combination set according to
IEs included in IE \"*Transport Format Combination Set*\";

1\> start to respect those transport format combinations;

If for a given TFCS in a given direction the size of the TFCI is changed
during reconfiguration, the network shall assign a new DBPSCH where the
TFCS will apply in the same direction after reconfiguration. A new
DBPSCH is a DBPSCH on which the TFCS did not apply prior to
reconfiguration.

If the IE \"*Transport Format Combination Set*\" is included and the
TFCI size is changed the MS shall:

1\> perform the TFCS reconfiguration of DBPSCH according to IEs included
in IE \"*Transport Format Combination Set*\".

If the IE \"*Transport Format Combination Set*\" is not included and if
there is no addition, removal or reconfiguration of transport channels,
the MS shall for that direction (uplink or downlink):

1\> use a previously stored transport format combination set if this
exists.

If the IE \"*Transport Format Combination Set*\" is not included; and

1\> if no transport format combination set is stored in the MS; or

1\> if transport channels are added or removed in the message; or

1\> if any transport channel is reconfigured in the message such that
the size of the transport format set is changed:

the MS shall:

1\> set the variable INVALID\_CONFIGURATION to TRUE.

In the uplink TFCS the minimum set of TFCs is the set of TFCs that is
needed for the TFC selection algorithm defined in 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.160. The
minimum set of TFCs consists of the following:

1\> for each RLC UM entity:

2\> a TFC with one transport block for this transport channel and empty
TFs for all the others. If more than one TFC fulfils this criteria, only
the TFC with the lowest number of bits should be included in the minimum
set of TFCs.

1\> for each RLC AM entity:

2\> a TFC with a non-empty TF for the corresponding transport channel
and empty TFs for all other transport channels, where the non-empty TF
includes one transport block with \"Configured RLC Size\" equal to the
RLC PDU size.

1\> for each RLC TM entity:

2\> a TFC with non-empty TFs for the corresponding transport channel,
and empty TFs for all other transport channels, where:

3\> for RLC TM entity the non-empty TFs include, for the smallest SDU
size that can be received in a single TTI from higher layer:

4\> a TF with non-zero number of transport blocks with \"Configured RLC
Size\" equal to the corresponding SDU size. If more than one TFC fulfils
this criteria, only the TFC with the lowest number of bits in the TFC is
included in the minimum set of TFCs.

1\> an \"empty\" TFC.

Furthermore, the GERAN should ensure that the uplink TFCS satisfies the
following rules:

1\> for the TTI length with which at least one transport channel is
configured:

2\> for each combination of TFs for the transport channels configured
with this TTI length included in the TFCS:

3\> a TFC with these TFs for the transport channels configured with this
TTI length and empty TFs on all transport channels configured with the
TTI length is also included in the TFCS.

specified in sub-clause 7.19.7.1.

1\> if the choice \"DL parameters\" is set to \'same as uplink\':

2\> if the IE \"*UL Transport Channel Identity*\" indicates an existing
or a new UL Transport Channel:

3\> store as transport format for this transport channel the transport
format associated with the transport channel identified by the IE \"*UL
Transport Channel Identity*\".

2\> else:

3\> set the variable INVALID\_CONFIGURATION to TRUE.

#### 7.19.7.6 Deleted UL TrCH information

always include a DL DCH TFCS configuration, either by including the IE
\"*DL DCH TFCS* \" or by specifying that the TFCS is the same as in UL.
If GERAN does not require the reconfiguration of the concerned
parameters, GERAN may replace one TFC with the value that is already
assigned for this IE.

#### 7.19.7.10 TFCS Reconfiguration/Addition Information

If the IE \"*TFCS Reconfiguration/Addition Information*\" is included
the MS shall:

1\> store the TFCs to be reconfigured/added indicated in the IE \"*CTFC
Information*\" as specified below;

In order to identify the TFCs included in this IE the MS shall calculate
the CTFC as specified in clause 11.

If the IE \"*TFCS Reconfiguration/Addition Information*\" is used in
case of TFCS \"Complete reconfiguration\" the MS shall:

1\> remove the TFCs indicated by the IE \"*TFCI*\" from the current
TFCS, and mark these positions (TFCI) in the TFCS as vacant.

2.  if \"*Compression Algorithm*\" flag is set to one and if the size of
    the TFCI can be reduced as a result of removing the vacant TFCIs,
    then the TFCI values shall be shifted as follows:

> For TFCI~loop~=1 on FR channels and 2 on HR channels, to (Number of
> non vacant positions in the TFCS - 1)
>
> If TFCI~loop~ is vacant then
>
> Assign to TFCI~loop~ the first remaining TFC for which the assigned
> TFCI \> TFCI~loop~ and then mark the position of that TFC (TFCI) as
> vacant.
>
> End if.
>
> End for.

2\> if \"*Compression Algorithm*\" flag is set to zero then no shift
shall be applied.

NOTE: whether the size of the TFCI can be reduced or not can easily be
assessed by:

$\left\lceil \text{log}_{2}\left( \text{NumberOfNonVacantPositions} \right) \right\rceil < \text{CurrentTFCISize}$

If TFC is used for SRB data transfer and layer 2 signalling as defined

8 Handling of unknown, unforeseen, and erroneous protocol data
==============================================================

8.1 General
-----------

This sub-clause specifies procedures for the handling of unknown,
unforeseen, and erroneous protocol data by the receiving entity. These
procedures are called \"error handling procedures\", but in addition to
provide recovery mechanisms for error situations they define a
compatibility mechanism for future extensions of the protocol.

The error handling procedures specified in this sub-clause shall apply
to all RRC messages. When there is a different handling for the same
message received on different logical channels, this is specified.

For system information, the error handling procedures applied on system
information messages are specified below.

When the MS receives an RRC message, it shall set the variable
PROTOCOL\_ERROR\_REJECT to FALSE and then perform the checks in the
order as defined below.

The error cases specified in the following include handling upon
reception of spare values. This behaviour also applies in case the
actual value of the IE results from mapping the originally sent IE
value. Moreover, in certain error cases, as specified in the following,
default values apply. In this case, the default values specified within
the procedure specifications apply.

The procedures for the handling of unknown, unforeseen, and erroneous
protocol data by the receiving entity for the ASN1 coded messages (CELL
UPDATE, GRA UPDATE and GRA UPDATE CONFIRM) sent on the SRB2 and IEs are
following the rules defined in 3GPP TS 25.331.

8.2 CSN.1 violation or encoding error
-------------------------------------

If the MS receives an RRC message on SRB 2, SRB 3 or SRB 4 for which the
encoded message does not result in any valid syntax value (or \"encoding
error\"), it shall perform the following. The MS shall:

1\> set the variable PROTOCOL\_ERROR\_REJECT to TRUE;

1\> transmit an RRC STATUS message on SRB2. The IE \"*Protocol Error
Information*\" shall contain an IE \"*Protocol Error Cause*\" set to
\"CSN.1 violation or encoding error\";

1\> when RRC STATUS message has been submitted to lower layers for
transmission:

2\> continue with any ongoing processes and procedures as if the invalid
message had not been received.

If the MS receives an RRC message sent via a radio access technology
other than GERAN, for which the encoded message does not result in any
valid syntax, the MS shall:

1\> set the variable PROTOCOL\_ERROR\_REJECT to TRUE;

1\> set the IE \"*Protocol Error Cause*\" in the variable
PROTOCOL\_ERROR\_INFORMATION to \"CSN.1 violation or encoding error\";

1\> perform procedure specific error handling according to clause 7.

If a set of system information message received on SRB 1 does not result
in any valid syntax value, the MS shall:

1\> ignore the set of system information message;

1\> treat the other sets of this system information message as if those
sets were not present.

If the MS receives an RRC message on SRB 1 for which the encoded message
does not result in any valid syntax value, it shall ignore the message.

If the MS receives an RRC message on SRB 2 and if the RRC message is
coded in ASN1 then MS shall follow the rules defined in 3GPP TS 25.331
for the DL messages sent on the DCCH.

If the MS receives an RRC message sent on SRB2 or via a radio access
technology other than GERAN, and the RRC message is coded in ASN1 for
which the encoded message does not result in any valid syntax, the MS
shall:

1\> set the variable PROTOCOL\_ERROR\_REJECT to TRUE;

1\> set the IE \"*Protocol Error Cause*\" in the variable
PROTOCOL\_ERROR\_INFORMATION to \"CSN.1 violation or encoding error\";

1\> perform procedure specific error handling according to clause 7.

8.3 Unknown or unforeseen message type
--------------------------------------

If a MS receives an RRC message on a SRB 2, SRB 3 or SRB 4 with a
message type not defined for that SRB it shall:

1\> set the variable PROTOCOL\_ERROR\_REJECT to TRUE;

1\> transmit an RRC STATUS message on SRB 2. The IE \"*Protocol Error
Information*\" shall contain an IE \"*Protocol Error Cause*\" set to
\"Message type non-existent or not implemented\";

1\> when the RRC STATUS message has been submitted to lower layers for
transmission:

2\> continue with any ongoing processes and procedures as if the invalid
message had not been received.

If the MS receives an RRC message on SRB 1 with a message type not
defined for the logical channel type the message was received on, it
shall ignore the message.

If the MS receives an RRC message on SRB2 with message type not defined for that SRB and if the RRC message is coded in ASN1 then MS shall follow the rules defined in 3GPP TS 25.331 for the DL messages sent on the DCCH.8.4 Unsolicited received message
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If the MS receives any of the following messages, on SRB 2:

\- an RRC CONNECTION SETUP message addressed to the MS; or

\- an RRC CONNECTION REJECT message addressed to the MS; or

\- a MS CAPABILITY INFORMATION CONFIRM message; or

\- a CELL UPDATE CONFIRM message addressed to the MS; or

\- a GRA UPDATE CONFIRM message addressed to the MS

and no procedure is ongoing according to clause 7 which expects the
message to be received:

the MS shall:

1\> ignore the received message.

8.5 Unexpected critical message extension
-----------------------------------------

If the MS receives an RRC message on SRB 2, SRB 3 or SRB 4, or sent via
a radio access technology other than GERAN, containing an undefined
critical message extension indicated with the error label: \'Critical
extension\', the MS shall:

1\> set the variable PROTOCOL\_ERROR\_REJECT to TRUE;

1\> set the IE \"*Protocol Error Cause*\" in the variable
PROTOCOL\_ERROR\_INFORMATION to \"Message extension not comprehended\";

1\> if the IE \"*Message Type*\" of the received message is not present
in the table \"Rejected transactions\" in the variable TRANSACTIONS:

2\> store the IE \"*Message Type*\" of the received message in the table
\"Rejected transactions\" in the variable TRANSACTIONS; and

2\> set the IE \"*RRC Transaction Identifier*\" to zero in that table
entry.

1\> perform procedure specific error handling according to clause 7.

If the MS receives an RRC message on the SRB 1, containing an undefined
critical message extension, the MS shall:

1\> ignore the message.

8.6 Message with error label: \'Content part error\'
----------------------------------------------------

If the MS receives an RRC message containing the error label: \'Content
part error\', the MS shall:

1\> set the variable PROTOCOL\_ERROR\_REJECT to TRUE;

1\> set the IE \"*Protocol Error Cause*\" in the variable
PROTOCOL\_ERROR\_INFORMATION to \"Message content part error\";

1\> if the IE \"*Message Type*\" of the received message is not present
in the table \"Rejected transactions\" in the variable TRANSACTIONS:

2\> store the IE \"*Message Type*\" of the received message in the table
\"Rejected transactions\" in the variable TRANSACTIONS; and

2\> set the IE \"*RRC Transaction Identifier*\" to zero in that table
entry;

1\> ignore the data corresponding to the description following the error
label;

1\> perform procedure specific error handling according to clause 7.

8.7 Unknown or unforeseen information element value, mandatory information element
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If the MS receives an RRC message on SRB 2, SRB 3 or SRB 4, or sent via
a radio access technology other than GERAN, with a mandatory IE having a
value, including choice, reserved for future extension (spare) or a
value not used in this version of the specification (e.g. a dummy
value), the MS shall:

1\> if a default value of the IE is defined in the procedure:

2\> treat the rest of the message using the default value of the IE.

1\> if no default value of the IE is defined in the procedure:

2\> set the variable PROTOCOL\_ERROR\_REJECT to TRUE;

2\> set the IE \"*Protocol Error Cause*\" in the variable
PROTOCOL\_ERROR\_INFORMATION to \"Information element value not
comprehended\";

2\> perform procedure specific error handling according to clause 7.

If the MS receives a system information message on SRB 1 with a
mandatory IE having a value reserved for future extension (spare) or a
value not used in this version of the specification (e.g. a dummy
value), the MS shall:

1\> if a default value of the IE is defined in the procedure:

2\> treat the rest of the system information message using the default
value of the IE.

1\> if no default value of the IE is defined in the procedure:

2\> ignore the system information message.

If the MS receives an RRC message on SRB 1 with a mandatory IE having a
value reserved for future extension (spare) or a value not used in this
version of the specification (e.g. a dummy value), the MS shall:

1\> if a default value of the IE is defined in the procedure:

2\> treat the rest of the message using the default value of the IE.

1\> if no default value of the IE is defined in the procedure:

2\> ignore the message.

If the MS receives an RRC message on SRB 2 or sent via a radio access
technology other than GERAN, with a mandatory IE having a value,
including choice, reserved for future extension (spare) or a value not
used in this version of the specification (e.g. a dummy value) and if
the RRC message is coded in ASN1 then MS shall follow the rules defined
in 3GPP TS 25.331 for the DL messages sent on the DCCH.

8.8 Unexpected non-critical message extension
---------------------------------------------

If the MS receives an RRC message on the SRB 2, SRB 3 or SRB 4, or sent
via a radio access technology other than GERAN, containing an undefined
non-critical message extension, the MS shall:

1\> ignore the content of the extension and the message contents after
the extension, but treat the parts of the message up to the extension
normally.

If the MS receives an RRC message on the SRB 1, containing an undefined
non-critical message extension, the MS shall:

1\> ignore the content of the extension and the message contents after
the extension, but treat the parts of the message up to the extension
normally.

If the MS receives an RRC message on the SRB 2,or sent via a radio
access technology other than GERAN, containing an undefined non-critical
message extension and if the RRC message is coded in the ASN1 then MS
shall follow the rules defined in 3GPP TS 25.331 for the DL messages
sent on the DCCH.

8.9 Message with error label: \'Message escape\'
------------------------------------------------

If the MS receives an RRC message containing the error label: \'Message
escape\' where the number of bits of the extension is not defined in
clause 9, the MS shall:

1\> ignore the message.

If the MS receives an RRC message containing the error label: \'Message
escape\' where the number of bits of the extension is defined in clause
9, the MS shall:

1\> ignore the extension by skiping the number of bits indicated in
clause 9;

1\> treat the rest of the message as if the extension was not present.

8.10 Handling of errors in nested information elements
------------------------------------------------------

This sub-clause specifies the handling of errors in mandatory IEs as
well as for conditional IEs for which the specified conditions for
presence are met, that are nested in another IE.

In case the MS receives an IE (Information Element 1) that includes a
mandatory IE (Information Field 1-1) having a value, including reserved
for future extension (spare) or a value not used in this version of the
specification (e.g. a dummy value), the MS shall:

1\> consider Information Element 1 to have an undefined value; and

1\> apply the corresponding generic error handling to Information
Element 1.

In case there are many IE nesting levels, in all of which the IE is
mandatory while no default value is defined, this treatment may need to
be repeated several times. The following example illustrates the general
principle.

Table 8.11.1: EXAMPLE MESSAGE information elements

+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| \< EXAMPLE MESSAGE message content \> ::=                            |

| };                                                                       |

+---------------------------------------------+

If in the above example, GERAN would include Information Element 1 and
set Information Field 1-1 to value 13, the MS experiences an error in a
mandatory IE. The guideline outlined in the previous then means that the
MS shall not discard the entire message but instead consider \"
Information Element 1\" to have an unknown value. Since Information
Element 1 is optional, the generic error handling would be to ignore \"
Information Element 1\".

In case the MS receives an IE (Information Element 1) that includes a
list of another IE (Information Field1-1) for which one or more entries
in the list have a value, including reserved for future extension
(spare) or a value not used in this version of the specification (e.g. a
dummy value), the MS shall:

1\> consider the list as if these entries were not included.

The rules of handling the errors for nested IE coded in ASN1 are defined
in 3GPP TS 25.331

8.11 Unknown or unforeseen information element value, optional information element coded in ASN1
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If the MS receives an RRC message coded in ASN1 on the SRB2, or sent via
a radio access technology other than GERAN, with an optional IE having a
value, including choice, reserved for future extension (spare) or a
value not used in this version of the specification (e.g. a dummy
value), it shall:

1\> ignore the value of the IE;

1\> treat the rest of the message as if the IE was not present.

9 Message functional definitions and contents
=============================================

9.1 General
-----------

### 9.1.1 Introduction

Padding is not needed for RRC messages since RRC is not a transmission
protocol.

For harmonization sake, it is assumed that GERAN RRC has to provide the
same extension capability as UTRAN RRC. The management of extension for
future releases is done at the message level or at Information Element
(IE) level when the IE uses the { \< Length of content \> \< Content \>
} format. The error handling is not defined at the IE level.

An IE can be structured or simple. A structured IE consists of other IEs
and/or fields. A simple IE consists of one field. A field defines
itself.

It was also agreed as working assumption that IEs in 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.018 to
be used in both modes (e.g. physical channel parameters) will not be
copied from 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.018 into 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.018. Instead, in
3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.118, two fields will be defined: the length in octets, as
bit(8), and a content placeholder with such length and whose definition
points to the value part of the IE in 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.018 should be included
in the 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.118. When the IE in 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.018 is coded in CSN.1
(e.g. RR PACKET UPLINK ASSIGNMENT) and it already includes the length, a
content placeholder with such length and whose definition points to the
value part of the IE in 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.018 should be included in
3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.118.

Bit fields within RRC messages shall have the highest numbered bit of
the bit field in the highest numbered bit of the lowest number octet.
The mapping of an 11 bit field is illustrated in figure 9.1.1.1.

  ------- ------- ------- ------- -------- -------- ------- ------- -----------
  bit                                                               
  8       7       6       5       4        3        2       1       
                                                                    Octet N
                                  bit 11   bit 10   bit 9   bit 8   Octet N+1
  bit 7   bit 6   bit 5   bit 4   bit 3    bit 2    bit 1           Octet N+2
                                                                    Octet N+3
  ------- ------- ------- ------- -------- -------- ------- ------- -----------

Figure 9.1.1.1: Field mapping within RRC messages

The encoding rules of the RRC messages (CELL UPDATE, GRA UPDATE and GRA
UPDATE CONFIRM) coded in ASN1 are following the ones defined in 3GPP TS
25.331.

### 9.1.2 Repetitions of Structure, IE or field:

The following coding shall be used for unbounded repetition:

> { { 1 \< **label** : \< IE \> \> } \*\* 0 } or,\
> { { 1 \< **field** : bit (integer) \> } \*\* 0 } or,\
> { { 1 \< repeated **struct** \> } \*\* 0 }

The following coding shall be used for bounded extension for optional
structures, IE\'s or fields:

> { 0 \| 1 \< **number of repetition** : bit (integer) \>\
> \< **label** : \< IE \> \>\* (n+val(number of repetition)) }
>
> or
>
> { 0 \| 1 \< **number of repetition** : bit (integer) \>\
> \< **field**: bit (integer) \>\* (n+val(number of repetition)) }
>
> or
>
> { 0 \| 1 \< **number of repetition** : bit (integer) \>\
> \< repeated **struct** \>\* (n+val(number of repetition)) }

where n â¥ 1.

The following coding shall be used for bounded extension for mandatory
structures, IE\'s or fields:

> { \< **number of repetition** : bit (integer) \>\
> \< **label** : \< IE \> \>\* (n+val(number of repetition)) }
>
> or
>
> { \< **number of repetition** : bit (integer) \>\
> \< **field** : bit (integer) \>\* (n+val(number of repetition)) }
>
> or
>
> { \< **number of repetition** : bit (integer) \>\
> \< repeated **struct** \>\* (n+val(number of repetition)) }

where n â¥ 1.

### 9.1.3 Message format and error labels

#### 9.1.3.1 General

The general format of messages, including these error labels, is:

+-----------------------------------------------------------+
| \< General message format \> ::=                          |
|                                                           |
| \< **MESSAGE\_TYPE** : \< bit (8) \> \>                   |
|                                                           |
| { \< contents \>                                          |
|                                                           |
| ! \< Content part error : bit (\*) = \< no string \> \> } |
|                                                           |
| ! \< Unknown message type : bit (8) = \< no string \> ;   |
+-----------------------------------------------------------+

Message type shall be coded using 8 bits with separate message type for
uplink and downlink, as follow:

+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| \< Uplink RRC messages \> ::=                                        |

|                                                                      |
| \< **MESSAGE\_TYPE** : 00000001 \> \< MESSAGE NAME2 message content  |

UPDATE CONFIRM) and the IEs coded in ASN1 are following the ones defined
in 3GPP TS 25.331.

#### 9.1.3.2 Message extension for new protocol version in RRC

Non-Critical message extension and critical message extension mechanism
from UTRAN RRC (3GPPÂ TSÂ 25.331) are duplicated in GERAN RRC.

The extension mechanism for the RRC messages (CELL UPDATE, GRA UPDATE
and GRA UPDATE CONFIRM) and the IEs coded in ASN1 is following the one
defined in 3GPP TS 25.331.

##### 9.1.3.2.1 Non-Critical extension

Non-critical extensions will be achieved by adding in the optional
references at the end of the message definition. The new elements
introduced to specify the extensions should be grouped together in a
structure with a name showing the version of the release.

+------------------------------------------------------------+

##### 9.1.3.2.2 Critical extension

At the beginning of the message, which may require critical extensions,
one bit is added for defining a choice of two branches. All Downlink
messages shall enable critical extension with an escape bit at the
beginning. One branch would include the message structure, the other
branch would be an empty sequence with the comment \'Message escape
critical extensions\'.

+----------------------------------------------------------------------+

When a new release is introduced, the empty sequence with \'Message
escape critical extensions\' will be replaced by a new structure that
includes a new type containing the message extensions, and the same
extension mechanism recursively for further extensions.

+----------------------------------------------------------------------+

The critical extension escape should be used as scarcely as possible in
order to preserve backward compatibility.

##### 9.1.3.2.3 Extension of IE\'s

If an IE is expected to be extended, the addition of a fixed length
extension length at the start of the IE, and \<spare bits \>\*\* at the
end will allow for future extension of the information element.

Table 9.1.3.2.3.1: Coding of IE extension in CSN.1

+------------------------------------+
| \< IE NAME message content \> ::=  |
|                                    |
| \< **IE Name Length** : bit (n) \> |
|                                    |
| \< **IE1** : \< IE1 \> \>          |
|                                    |
| \< **IE2** : \< IE2 \> \>          |
|                                    |
| \< spare bit \>\*\* ;              |
+------------------------------------+

Table 9.1.3.2.3.2: Example description of IE extension fields

  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **IE Name Length (n bit field)**\
  This field is the binary representation of the length in bits of the IE (excluding the length field) struct. Range 0-2...

  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

##### 9.1.3.2.4 \'Message escape\' error label

The \'Message escape\' error label is used to provide an escape for,
e.g. a future modification of the message syntax. The generic
description is:

+------------------------------------------------------+
| 0 \< Content \>                                      |
|                                                      |
| ! \< Message escapeÂ : 1 bit (N) = \< no string \> \> |
+------------------------------------------------------+

An \'Message escape\' error label shall be applied by the receiver of a
downlink RRC message when specified in the message description. The
description on the left of the error branch needs to be correctly
recognised. Otherwise, the error branch \'Message escape\' is called. N
should be an integer to enable the receiver to skip the exact number of
information bits in the message in case of error. N may also be \'\*\'
when the number of bits are not defined.

9.2 Messages for Radio Resources management
-------------------------------------------

### 9.2.1 General

Each definition given in the sub-clause 9.2 includes:

-   a brief description of the message direction and use;

-   a CSN.1 description of the message, information elements and fields
    (see CSN.1 Specification, Version 2.0). Definition of information
    elements may immediately follow the definition of the message. If
    the definition of an information element immediately follows the
    message definition, the information element name ends with
    \'struct\'. Otherwise the information element name ends with \'IE\'
    and the definition of the information element is defined in
    sub-clause 9.3 or in 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.160. The definition of a \'struct\'
    is valid only within the table in which it is defined. No references
    shall be made to a \'struct\' definition from outside of the table
    in which it is defined or from outside the present document. The
    definition of an information element is valid throughout clause 9. ;

-   a table follows which contains a definition for each field
    referenced in the message definition or in an information element
    struct immediately following the message definition. Presence
    requirement for information elements or fields may be indicated in
    this table to define when the information elements shall be included
    or not, what non-presence of such information elements or fields
    means, and, for IEs with conditional presence requirement, the
    static conditions for presence and/or non-presence of the
    information elements or fields. However, the normative text for the
    presence requirement for information elements or fields is specified
    in the appropriate procedure sub-clause;

  **Handover to CDMA2000 Command struct**\
  This structure contains the message HANDOVER to CDMA2000 COMMAND and the length of the HANDOVER to CDMA2000 COMMAND message. The HANDOVER to CDMA2000 COMMAND message is defined in TIA/EIA/IS-833 and TIA/EIA/IS-2000-5.
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE: The MSG\_TYPE of the cdma2000 message used for the intersystem
handover is included in the first octet of the Handover to CDMA2000
Command struct. It is specified in TIA/EIA/IS-2000 and in
TIA/EIA/IS-833. (E.g. MSG\_TYPE::= {00010001} if Extended Handoff
Direction Message (EHDM) is used, MSG\_TYPE::= {00011111} if General
Handoff Direction Message is used, etc.). The order of the bits in this
octet representing is given by the following example. If
MSG\_TYPE::={00010001} (EHDM), the bit number 1 of \'cdma2000 MSG\_TYPE
IEI\' is \'0\', the bit number 2 shall be \'0\', etc., and the bit
number 8 is \'1\'.\
\
The remaining octets in the Handover to CDMA2000 Command struct is coded
as the payload of the message used for the inter system handover, as
specified in TIA/EIA/IS-2000-5 and in TIA/EIA/IS-833. The bit ordering
is similar to the case described above. The bit number 1 of \'cdma2000
message payload\' is coded as the first bit of the first record of the
message defined in TIA/EIA/IS-2000-5 and in TIA/EIA/IS-833, reading the
records defined in TIA/EIA/IS-2000-5 and in TIA/EIA/IS-833 from left to
right.

### 9.3.47 MS RF Capability GSM

The purpose of the *MS RF Capability GSM* information element is to
provide the radio part of the network with information concerning radio
aspects of the mobile station. The contents might affect the manner in
which the network handles the operation of the mobile station.

The *MS RF Capability GSM* information element is coded as shown in
table 9.3.47.1.

For the indication of the Access Technology Types the following
conditions shall apply:

\- Among the three Access Type Technologies GSM 900-P, GSM 900-E and GSM
900-R only one shall be present.

\- Due to shared radio frequency channel numbers between GSM 1800 and
GSM 1900, the mobile station should provide the relevant radio access
capability for either GSM 1800 band OR GSM 1900 band, not both.

\- The MS shall indicate its supported Access Technology Types.

For error handling the following shall apply:

\- If a received Access Technology Type is unknown to the receiver, it
shall ignore all the corresponding fields.

\- If within a known Access Technology Type a receiver recognizes an
unknown field it shall ignore it.

\- For more details about error handling of MS radio access capability
see 3GPPÂ TSÂ 48.018.

The following table includes constants that are either used as multi
bounds (name starting with \"max\") or as high or low value in a type
specification (name starting with \"lo\" or \"hi\"). Constants are
specified only for values appearing more than once in the RRC
specification. In case a constant is related to one or more other
constants, an expression is included in the \"value\" column instead of
the actual value.

11 Specific functions
=====================

11.1 Provision and reception of RRC information between network nodes
---------------------------------------------------------------------

### 11.1.1 General

In certain cases, e.g., when performing handover to GERAN or when
performing SBSS relocation, RRC information may need to be transferred
between GERAN nodes, between GERAN and another RAT, between nodes within
another RAT or between the MS and another RAT.

The RRC information exchanged between network nodes or between the MS
and another RAT is typically transferred by means of RRC information
containers. An RRC information container is a self-contained and
extensible RRC information unit that may be used to transfer a number of
different RRC messages, one at a time. As stated before, RRC information
containers may be used to transfer RRC messages across interfaces other
than the Um interface. The RRC messages that may be included in RRC
information containers have similar characteristics as the RRC messages
that are transferred across the Um interface.

The RRC messages tht are sent to/ from the MS, e.g RADIO BEARER
RECONFIGURATION, INTER SYSTEM TO UTRAN HANDOVER COMMAND HANDOVER FROM
GERAN Iu MODE COMMAND are covered by (sub)clauses 7 and 9 of this
specification. The following sub-clauses concern RRC messages exchanged
between network nodes.

In future versions of this specification, it is possible to extend the
RRC messages transferred across interfaces other than Um. For these RRC
messages the same extension mechanism applies as defined for RRC
messages transferred across the Um interface, as is specified in
sub-clause 9, i.e., both critical and non-critical extensions may be
added.

The transfer syntax for RRC information containers and RRC messages
transferred between network nodes is derived from the description used
in the target node. The resulting bit or octet string is, carried in a
container, transferred between the network nodes.

When using a separate RRC information container for each endpoint, the
receiving RRC protocol entity is able to interpret the received
container; this means that the receiver need not take into account
information about the (network interface) message used in transferring
the container.

### 11.1.2 General error handling for RRC messages exchanged between network nodes

The error handling for RRC messages that are exchanged between network
nodes applies the same principles as defined for other RRC messages.

Although the same principles apply for network nodes receiving unknown,
unforeseen and erroneous RRC messages received in RRC information
containers, the notification of the error should be done in a different
manner, as specified in the following:

The network node receiving an invalid RRC message from another network
node should:

1\> if the received RRC message was unknown, unforeseen or erroneous:

2\> prepare an RRC FAILURE INFO message, including the IE \"*Failure
Cause*\" set to \"Protocol error\" and the IE \"Protocol error
information\" including an IE \"*Protocol Error Cause*\" which should be
set as follows:

3\> to \"CSN.1 violation or encoding error\" upon receiving an RRC
message for which the encoded message does not result in any valid c
syntax value;

3\> to \"Message type non-existent or not implemented\" upon receiving
an unknown RRC message type;

3\> to \"Message extension not comprehended\" upon receiving an RRC
message including an undefined critical message extension;

3\> to \"Information element value not comprehended\" upon receiving an
RRC message including an mandatory IE for which no default value is
defined and for which either the value is set to spare or for which the
encoded IE does not result in a valid transfer syntax. The same applies
for conditional IEs, for which the conditions for presence are met, the
IE is present but has a value set to spare or for which the encoded IE
does not result in a valid transfer syntax;

3\> to \"Information element missing\" upon receiving an RRC information
container with an absent conditional IE for which the conditions for
presence are met.

1\> if there was another failure to perform the operation requested by
the received RRC message:

2\> prepare an RRC FAILURE INFO message, including the IE \"*Failure
Cause*\" set to a value that reflects the failure cause.

1\> send the RRC FAILURE INFO message to the network node from which the
invalid RRC protocol information was received.

NOTE 1: The appropriate (failure) messages used across the network
interfaces may not support the inclusion of a RRC information container.
In this case, the information contained in the RRC FAILURE INFO message
may need to be transferred otherwise e.g. by mapping to a cause value
(e.g. a cause value in the RR-HANDOVER FAILURE message when there is a
error associated with the RRC-RADIO BEAERER RECONFIGURATION message).

NOTE 2 In case the RRC procedure used to perform SBSS relocation fails
e.g. due to non comprehension, the source BSS may notify the target BSS
by including the diagnostics information (IEs \"Protocol error\" and
\"Protocol error information\") in the \"RRC message \"SBSS Relocation\"
Info sent in the RRC information container\" used for a subsequent
relocation request.

### 11.1.3 RRC Information to target GERAN Iu mode BSS

The RRC information container \"RRC Information to target GERAN Iu mode
BSS\" may either be sent from source GERAN Iu mode BSS or from another
RAT. In case of Handover to GERAN, this information originates from
another RAT, while in case of SBSS relocation the RRC information
originates from the source BSS. In case of handover to GERAN, the RRC
information transferred may provide GERAN specific information, as
defined in the INTER RAT HANDOVER INFO WITH INTER RAT CAPABILITIES
message, that the target BSS needs when preparing the handover command
message. In case of SBSS relocation, the RRC information transferred
specifies the configuration of RRC and the lower layers it controls,
e.g., including the radio bearer and RLC configuration. It is used by
the target BSS to initialise RRC and the lower layer protocols to
facilitate SBSS relocation in a manner transparent to the MS.

### 11.1.4 RRC information, target BSS to source BSS

There are 2 possible cases for BSS relocation:

1 The MS is already under control of target BSS; and

2 The SBSS Relocation with Handover (MS still under control of SBSS),
but MS is moving to a location controlled by the target BSS (based on
measurement information).

In case 1 the relocation is transparent to the MS and there is no
\"reverse\" direction container. The SBSS just assigns the \'serving\'
function to the target BSS, which then becomes the Serving BSS.

In case 2 the relocation is initiated by SBSS, which also provides the
RRC INFORMATION TO TARGET GERAN IU MODE BSS Container to the target BSS.
Based upon this information, the target BSS prepares the RADIO BEARER
RECONFIGURATION Message.

The source BSS then transmits the Handover Message to the MS, which then
performs the handover.

In the successful case, the MS transmits a RADIO BEARER RECONFIGURATION
COMPLETE message, using the new configuration, to the target BSS.

In case of failure, the MS transmits an RADIO BEARER RECONFIGURATION
FAILURE, using the old configuration, to the source BSS and the RRC
context remains unchanged (has to be confirmed and checked with the SBSS
relocation procedure).

11.2 Provision and reception of RRC security information between network nodes
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 11.2.1 General

In certain cases, e.g., when performing handover or when performing SBSS
relocation, RRC security related information shall be transferred
between other RATs and GERAN or between GERAN nodes within GERAN.

The lengths of the RLC counters of non-transparent radio bearers are
different between GPRS (24bits) and EGPRS (20bits). The BSC shall set
the HFN values according the source cell (GPRS or EGPRS) and independent
from the target cell (UTRAN, GPRS or EGPRS).

In the following, the RRC security information to be transferred is
separeted into the three scenarious:

\- GERAN *A/Gb mode* to GERAN *Iu mode*.

\- GERAN *Iu mode* to GERAN *Iu mode* or UTRAN to GERAN *Iu mode*.

### 11.2.2 RRC Security Information, from GERAN-A/Gb to GERAN-Iu

The START value is used to initialise the most significant bits of all
the HFN counters (MAC HFN, RLC AM HFN, RLC UM HFN, RRC HFN).

  **Start-CS**\
  The *START* IE is used to intialise the most significant bits of all the HFN counters (MAC HFN, RLC AM HFN, RLC UM HFN, RRC HFN) for the CS domain. The *START* IE is defined in sub-clause 9.3.102.

  **Start-PS**\
  The *START* IE is used to intialise the most significant bits of all the HFN counters (MAC HFN, RLC AM HFN, RLC UM HFN, RRC HFN) for the PS domain. The *START* IE is defined in sub-clause 9.3.102.
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 11.2.3 RRC Security Information, from GERAN Iu mode/UTRAN to GERAN Iu mode

This IE contains security information required for continued
communication between the MS and GERAN after a handover or SRNS/SBSS
relocation

### 11.2.4 RRC Security Information, from GERAN Iu to UTRAN

NOTE: This information should be specified in 25.331 since UTRAN is the
target RAT.

11.3 HFN mapping rules for radio bearer using non-transparent mode RLC
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The length of RLC counters in UTRAN (RLC-AM 20bits, RLC-UM 25bits) and
GERAN-Iu are different. In GERAN-Iu there are additional differences
between GPRS (RLC-AM and RLC-UM 24bits) and EGPRS (RLC-AM and RLC-UM
20bits).

The network nodes shall use the following HFN mapping rules when sending
or receiving HFN values within the RRC information containers:

1\> the source network node shall set the HFN value as used in the
source cell,

1\> if the target network node receives an HFN value with the same
length as used in the target cell;

2\> increment this HFN by 1; and

2\> use this value as HFN in the target cell;

1\> if the target network node receives an HFN which is longer than the
one used in the target cell;

2\> take the MSBs as needed for the target cell;

2\> increment this value by 1; and

2\> use this value as HFN in the target cell;

1\> if the target network node receives an HFN which is shorter than the
one used in the target cell;

2\> increment this HFN by 1;

2\> add a number of least significant zero bits as needed; and

2\> use this value as HFN in the target cell.

11.4 Calculated Transport Format Combination
--------------------------------------------

The CTFCs are used to signal the transport format combination set. Every
possible transport format combination shall uniquely be identified by
one CTFC, including transport format combinations, which are not members
of the transport format combination set.

Two formulas shall be used to define the CTFC. Let *I* be the number of
transport channels that shall be included in the transport format
combination. Each transport channel TrCH*~i~*, *i* = 1, 2,..., *I*,
shall have *L~i~* transport formats, i.e. the transport format indicator
*TFIN~i~* can take *L~i~* values,
$\text{TFIN}_{i} \in \left\{ 0,1,2,\text{.}\text{.}\text{.},L_{i} - 1 \right\}$.
For each transport channel, the transport format such that *TFIN~i~* = 0
is the empty transport format.

*Define* $P_{i} = \prod_{j = 0}^{i - 1}L_{j}$*, where i = 1, 2, ..., I,
and L~0~ = 1*

Let *TFC*(*TFIN~1~*, *TFIN~2~*, ..., *TFIN~I~)* be the transport format
combination for which TrCH*~1~* shall transport format *TFIN~1~*,
TrCH~2~ shall transport format *TFIN~2~*, etc. The corresponding
*CTFC*(*TFIN~1~*, *TFIN~2~*, ..., *TFIN~I~*) is then computed as:

$\text{CTFC}(\text{TFIN}_{1},\text{TFIN}_{2},\ldots,\text{TFIN}_{I}) = \sum_{i = 1}^{I}\text{TFIN}_{i} \cdot P_{i}$

The transport format combination such that CTFC = 0 is the empty
transport format combination.

After computing the CTFC value for all allowed transport format
combinations (a CTFC is defined for all transport format combinations,
but it is only necessary to compute the CTFC for the allowed transport
format combinations), the CTFCs are signalled in order. The TFCIs are
then assigned in the same order, i.e. the first TFC signalled by its
CTFC will correspond to TFCI = 0, the next corresponds to TFCI = 1, etc.

In a Layer 3 signalling message, the CTFC values shall be encoded using
a variable size field, the size of which is the same for all values and
depends on the highest value to be signalled. The possible sizes are: 2
bits, 4 bits, 6 bits, 8 bits, 12 bits and 16 bits. The size of the
fields is signalled in the Layer 3 message.

11.5 Signalling TFC
-------------------

One TFC shall be defined that shall be used for SRB data transfer and
layer 2 signalling (see 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.160). That TFC shall be the first one
in the TFCS, for which the TFCI equals 0. In that TFC, only one TrCH
shall be active and shall have the following transport format:

\- 184 bits transport blocks;

\- 18 bits CRC;

\- 256 for the RMA.

NOTE: The value of the RMA does not matter since there is only one
active TrCH.
