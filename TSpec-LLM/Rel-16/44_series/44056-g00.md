1 Scope
=======

The present document specifies the procedures used at the CTS radio
interface (Reference Point Um\*, see GSM 03.56) for Call Control (CC),
Mobility Management (MM), Radio Resource (RR).

When the notations for \"further study\" or \"FS\" or \"FFS\" are
present in the present document they mean that the indicated text is not
a normative portion of the present document.

These procedures are defined in terms of messages exchanged over the
control channels of the radio interface. The CTS control channels are
described in GSM 03.52.

The structured functions and procedures of this protocol and the
relationship with other layers and entities are described in general
terms in GSM 04.07.

1.1 Scope of the Technical Specification
----------------------------------------

The procedures currently described in the present document are for the
call control of circuit-switched connections, mobility management and
radio resource management for circuit-switched services over the CTS
radio interface.

GSM 04.10 contains functional procedures for support of supplementary
services.

GSM 04.11 contains functional procedures for support of point-to-point
short message services.

NOTE: \"layer 3\" includes the functions and protocols described in the
present document. The terms \"data link layer\" and \"layer 2\" are used
interchangeably to refer to the layer immediately below layer 3.

1.2 Application to the interface structures
-------------------------------------------

The layer 3 procedures apply to the interface structures defined in
GSM 04.03. They use the functions and services provided by layer 2
defined in GSM 04.05 and GSM 04.06. GSM 04.07 gives the general
description of layer 3 including procedures, messages format and error
handling.

1.3 Structure of layer 3 procedures
-----------------------------------

A building block method is used to describe the layer 3 procedures.

The basic building blocks are \"elementary procedures\" provided by the
protocol control entities of the three sublayers, i.e. radio resource
management, mobility management and connection management sublayer.

Complete layer 3 transactions consist of specific sequences of
elementary procedures. The term \"structured procedure\" is used for
these sequences.

1.4 Test procedures
-------------------

Test procedures of the GSM-CTS radio interface signalling are described
in GSM 11.10 and GSM 11.56 series.

1.5 Use of logical channels
---------------------------

The logical control channels are defined in GSM 03.52. In the following
those control channels are considered which carry signalling information
or specific types of user packet information: \[to be completed\]:

i\) CTS Beacon CHannel (CTSBCH): downlink only, used to broadcast Cell
specific information and fixed part identification information;

ii\) CTS Paging CHannel (CTSPCH): downlink only, used to send page
requests to Mobile Stations (MSs);

iii\) CTS Access Random CHannel (CTSARCH): uplink only, used to request
a Dedicated Control CHannel;

iv\) CTS-Access Grant CHannel (CTSAGCH): downlink only, used to allocate
a Dedicated Control CHannel;

v\) Fast Associated Control CHannel (FACCH): bi-directional, associated
with a Traffic CHannel;

vi\) Slow Associated Control CHannel (SACCH): bi-directional, associated
with a Traffic CHannel;

Two service access points are defined on signalling layer 2 which are
discriminated by their Service Access Point Identifiers (SAPI) (see
GSM 04.06):

i\) SAPI 0: supports the transfer of signalling information including
user-user information;

ii\) SAPI 3: supports the transfer of user short messages.

Layer 3 selects the service access point, the logical control channel
and the mode of operation of layer 2 (acknowledged, unacknowledged or
random access, see GSM 04.05 and GSM 04.06) as required for each
individual message.

1.6 Overview of control procedures

3 Definitions, abbreviations and Random values
==============================================

3.1 Definitions
---------------

For the purposes of the present document, the terms and definitions
given in GSM 04.08 and the following apply:

**CTS-idle mode:** in this mode, the mobile station is not allocated any
dedicated channel; it listens to the BCH and to the CCH when requested

NOTE: In CTS‑RR connected mode, main DCCH means FACCH.4 CTS-Radio
Resource management procedures

3.2 Abbreviations
-----------------

For the purposes of the present document, the abbreviations given in GSM
01.04 apply.

3.3 Random values
-----------------

In a number of places in the present document, it is mentioned that some
value must take a \"random\" value, in a given range, or more generally
with some statistical distribution.

It is required that there is a low probability that two equipment\'s in
the same conditions (including the case of two equipment\'s of the same
type from the same manufacturer) will choose the same value. Moreover,
it is required that, if it happens that two equipment\'s in similar
conditions choose the same value, the probability of their choices being
identical at the next occasion is the same as if their first choices had
been different.

The meaning of such a specification is that any statistical test for
these values, done on a series of similar events, will obtain a result
statistically compatible with the specified distribution. This shall
hold even in the cases where the tests are conducted with a subset of
possible events, with some common parameters. Moreover, basic tests of
independence of the values within the series shall pass.

Data against which correlation with the values shall not be found are
the protocol state, or the IMSI, or identities or other unrelated
information broadcast by the network, or the current TDMA frame number.

4 Overview/General
==================

4.1 Overview
------------

### 4.1.1 General

CTS-Radio Resource management procedures include the functions related
to the management of the common transmission resources, e.g. the
physical channels and the data link connections on control channels.

The general purpose of CTS-Radio Resource procedures is to establish,
maintain and release RR connections that allow a point-to-point dialogue
between the CTS‑FP and a mobile station. Moreover, Radio Resource
management procedures at the CTS‑MS side include the reception of the
uni-directional CTSBCH and CTSPCH when no RR connection is established.
This permits automatic cell selection/reselection.

### 4.1.2 Services provided to upper layers

A CTS‑RR connection is a physical connection used by the two peer
entities to support the upper layers\' exchange of information flows.

#### 4.1.2.1 CTS-Idle mode

In CTS-idle mode no CTS-RR connection exists.

The RR procedures include (on the mobile station side) those for
automatic cell selection/reselection. The RR entity indicates to upper
layers the unavailability of a CTSBCH/CTSPCH and the cell change when
decided by the RR entity. Upper layers are advised of the CTSBCH
broadcast information when a new cell has been selected, or when a
relevant part of this information changes.

In Idle mode, upper layers can require the establishment of an CTS-RR
connection.

In Idle-mode, RR procedures provide the following service:

\- alive check (CTS‑FP side);

\- hunting;

\- connectionless group alerting;

\- CTS system information broadcasting.

Connectionless group alerting is a point-to-multipoint unidirectional
transmission on the CTSPCH. It can only be initiated by the CTS‑FP.

#### 4.1.2.2 Dedicated mode

In dedicated mode, the CTS‑RR connection is a physical point-to-point
bi-directional connection, and includes a SAPI 0 data link connection
operating in multiframe mode on the main DCCH. If dedicated mode is
established, RR procedures provide the following services:

\- establishment/release of multiframe mode on data link layer
connections other than SAPI 0, on the main DCCH or on the SACCH
associated with the channel carrying the main signalling link;

\- transfer of messages on any data link layer connection;

\- indication of temporary unavailability of transmission (suspension,
resuming);

\- indication of loss of CTS-RR connection;

\- setting/change of the transmission mode on the physical channels,
including change of type of channel, change of the
coding/decoding/transcoding mode and setting of ciphering;

\- release of an CTS-RR connection.

### 4.1.3 Services required from data link and physical layers

The CTS-RR sublayer uses the services provided by the data link layer as
defined in GSM 04.05.

Moreover, the RR sublayer directly uses services provided by the
physical layer such as CTSBCH searching, as defined in GSM 04.04.

### 4.1.4 Change of dedicated channels

NOTE: for this version of the protocol, no intra-cell handover is to be
defined.

#### 4.1.4.1 Change of dedicated channels using SAPI = 0

In case a change of dedicated channels is required using a dedicated
assignment procedure, the RR sublayer will request the data link layer
to suspend multiple frame operation before the mobile station leaves the
old channel. When the channel change has been completed, layer 3 will
request the data link layer to resume multiple frame operation again.
The layer 2 suspend/resume procedures are described in GSM 04.05 and
04.06.

These procedures are specified in such a way that a loss of a layer 3
message cannot occur on the radio interface. However, messages sent from
the mobile station to the CTS‑FP may be duplicated by the data link
layer if a message has been transmitted but not yet completely
acknowledged before the mobile station leaves the old channel (see
GSM 04.06).

As the RR sublayer is controlling the channel change, a duplication of
RR messages does not occur. However, there are some procedures for which
a duplication is possible, e.g. DTMF procedures. For all upper layer
procedures using the transport service of the RR sub-layer (e.g. MM and
CM procedures), the request messages sent by the mobile station contain
a sequence number in order to allow the CTS‑FP to detect duplicated
messages, which are then ignored by the CTS‑FP. The procedures for
sequenced transmission on layer 3 are described in subclause 4.1.4.2.

#### 4.1.4.2 Change of dedicated channels using other SAPIs than 0

For SAPIs other than 0, the data link procedures described in GSM 04.06
do not provide any guarantee against message loss or duplication.

Therefore, if an application uses a SAPI other than 0 and if this
application is sensitive to message loss or duplication, then it has to
define its own protection mechanism. No general protection mechanism is
provided by the protocol defined in the present document.

#### 4.1.4.3 Sequenced message transfer operation

Upper layer messages sent using the RR sub-layer transport service from
the mobile station to the CTS-FP can be duplicated by the data link
layer in the following case:

\- a channel change of dedicated channels is required (assignment
procedure) and the last layer 2 frame has not been acknowledged by the
peer data link layer before the mobile station leaves the old channel.

In this case, the mobile station does not know whether the CTS-FP has
received the message correctly. Therefore, the mobile station has to
send the message again after the new dedicated channel is established
(see GSM 04.06).

The CTS-FP must be able to detect the duplicated received message.
Therefore, each concerned upper layer message must be marked with a send
sequence number.

For historical reasons (see GSM 04.08), messages sent with the CC, SS
and MM PDs share the same sequence numbering.

##### 4.1.4.3.1 Variables and sequence numbers

###### 4.1.4.3.1.1 Send state variable V(SD)

The RR sublayer of the mobile station shall have one associated send
state variable V(SD) (\"Send Duplicated\") for each upper layer message
flow. The send state variable denotes the sequence number of the next in
sequence numbered message in the flow to be transmitted. The value of
the corresponding send state variable shall be incremented by one with
each numbered message transmission. Arithmetic operations on V(SD) are
performed modulo 2.

###### 4.1.4.3.1.2 Send sequence number N(SD)

At the time when such a message to be numbered is designated for
transmission, the value of N(SD) for the message to be transferred is
set equal to the value of the send state variable V(SD). See GSM 04.07.

##### 4.1.4.3.2 Procedures for the initiation, transfer execution and termination of the sequenced message transfer operation

###### 4.1.4.3.2.1 Initiation

The sequenced message transfer operation is initiated by establishing a
RR connection. The send state variables V(SD) are set to 0.

###### 4.1.4.3.2.2 Transfer Execution

The CTS-FP must compare the send sequence numbers of pairs of subsequent
messages in the same upper layer messages flow. In case the send
sequence numbers of two subsequent messages in a flow are not identical,
no duplication has occurred. In case the send sequence numbers are
identical, the CTS-FP must ignore the second one of the received
messages.

###### 4.1.4.3.2.3 Termination

The sequenced message transfer operation is terminated by the RR
connection release procedure.

### 4.1.5 Procedure for Service Request and Contention Resolution

Upon seizure of the assigned dedicated channel, the mobile station
establishes the main signalling link on this channel by sending a layer
2 SABM frame containing a layer 3 service request message. The data link
layer will store this message to perform the contention resolution. The
service request message will be returned by the CTS‑FP in the UA frame.

The data link layer in the mobile station compares the content of the
information field (i.e. the layer 3 service request message) received in
the UA frame with the stored message and leaves the channel in case they
do not match. This procedure resolves contentions in the case where
several mobile stations have accessed at the same random access slot and
with the same random reference and one has succeeded due to capture. The
full description of the procedure is given in GSM 04.06.

The purpose of the service request message is to indicate to the CTS‑FP
which service the mobile station is requesting. This then allows the
CTS‑FP to decide how to proceed (e.g. to authenticate or not).

The service request message must contain the identity of the mobile
station and may include further information which can be sent without
encryption.

4.2 Idle mode procedures
------------------------

### 4.2.1 Mobile Station side

#### 4.2.1.1 CTSBCH and CTSPCH monitoring

In CTS-idle mode, a MS which has recognised a known FPBI, listens to the
CTSBCH and to the CTSPCH when CTSPCH indicator flags indicates
\"*CTSPCH to decode*\".

#### 4.2.1.2 Alive check response

When the CTSPCH contains an CTS ALIVE CHECK REQUEST message, the
addressed CTS‑MS shall send a CTS ALIVE CHECK RESPONSE message. A
CTS ALIVE CHECK RESPONSE message shall be send by the CTS‑MS in response
to each CTS ALIVE CHECK REQUEST message received with the corresponding
CTSMSI.

The CTS ALIVE CHECK RESPONSE messages are sent on the CTSARCH and
contain as parameters:

\- an establishment cause which corresponds to \"*attachment update*\"
given by the RR entity in response to a CTS ALIVE CHECK REQUEST message;

\- the CTS‑MS Mobile Subscriber Identity.

### 4.2.2 CTS-FP side

#### 4.2.2.1 CTSBCH information broadcasting

FPBI and CTS-FP status are regularly broadcast by the CTS-FP on the
CTSBCH. Based on this information, the CTS-MS is able to decide whether
it may gain access to the CTS-FP.

The information broadcast may be grouped in the following classes:

\- information giving unique identification of the current CTS-FP cell;

\- information describing the Training Sequence Code to be used in
dedicated mode;

\- information describing the Radio Resource availability at the CTS-FP
side;

\- information describing the presence of a Paging Channel;

\- information describing the timeslot number to be used by the CTSCCH
except CTSBCH (i.e. CTSARCH, CTSPCH and CTSAGCH);

\- information describing the shifting status of the CTSBCH.

#### 4.2.2.2 CTSPCH information broadcasting

In pure idle mode, the Paging Channel is not used. The CTS-FP shall set
the CTSPCH indicator flag to \"*no CTSPCH*\" value.

#### 4.2.2.3 Alive check

The CTS-FP initiates the alive check procedure by broadcasting a
CTS PAGING REQUEST message with an indication of Alive Check, and start
timer TC3101. The CTSPCH indicator flag shall be set to
\"*CTSPCH to decode*\" and the CTSBCH‑SB Status field shall be set to
idle. The alive check procedure shall not be triggered if the CTS‑FP is
in a busy state (no radio resources available); i.e. CTS‑FP RR layer
shall reject upper layer alive check procedure initiation request.

When receiving a CTS PAGING REQUEST with an indication of Alive Check,
the CTS-MS shall send 2 CTS ACCESS REQUEST messages.

When receiving a valid CTS ACCESS REQUEST, the CTS‑FP shall stop timer
TC3101.

The CTS‑FP RR sublayer shall end the alive check procedure when:

\- a CTS ACCESS REQUEST with a valid cause has been received from the
polled CTS‑MS; or

\-- timer TC3101 expires; or

\- an end of alive check procedure is triggered by the upper layer; or

\- a paging procedure requiring a new PAGING REQUEST message to be
started; or

\- a busy state occurs (i.e. no more radio resource available).

The CTS‑FP shall ignore unsolicited or out of sequence CTS ACCESS
REQUEST.

#### 4.2.2.4 Hunting

The CTS-FP initiates the hunting procedure by continuously broadcasting
CTS HUNTING REQUEST messages on the CTSPCH channel, and start timer
TC3102. The CTSPCH indicator flag shall be set to
\"*CTSPCH to decode*\". The value of TC3102 is manufacturer dependant,
but shall be less than 120 s. The hunting procedure shall not be
triggered if the CTS‑FP is in a busy state (no radio resources
available); i.e. CTS‑FP RR layer shall reject upper layer hunting
procedure initiation request.

Upon receipt of a CTS HUNTING REQUEST, the CTS‑MSs shall act as
following:

\- if group alerting was requested, the CTS‑MS shall alert if the
received connectionless group CTSMSI is equal to its assigned
connectionless group CTSMSI (if any);

\- if collective alerting was requested, the CTS‑MS shall start
alerting.

Hunted CTS‑MS are required to receive and analyse the message sent on
the next CTSPCH occurrence. The CTS‑MSs shall consider that the hunting
procedure has been ended by the CTS‑FP when no CTS HUNTING REQUEST
message has been received within the 3 latest occurrences of the CTSPCH.
The CTS-MSs shall stop alerting.

The CTS‑FP shall end the hunting procedure when:

\- T~C3102~ expires; or

\- a paging procedure is to be started; or

\- an end of hunting procedure is triggered by the CTS‑FP user; or

\- a busy state occurs (i.e. no more radio resource available).

A CTS‑MS shall stop alerting when requested by the user.

#### 4.2.2.5 Connectionless group alerting

On receipt of a request for an incoming call, the CTS‑FP may decide to
alert part or all enrolled CTS‑MSs.

In this case the CTS‑FP shall request the RR sublayer to send a request
for alerting indicating which CTS‑MSs shall alert. Either the group mask
shall be used to alert all CTS‑MSs having an assigned connectionless
group CTSMSI matching the group mask, or the connectionless CTSMSI shall
be used to alert the CTS‑MSs having this connectionless CTSMSI assigned,
or the Collective Broadcast Identifier shall be used to alert all
CTS‑MSs.

This Connectionless CTS-MS paging procedure should be used for group or
collective connectionless alerting service when the number of paged
CTS‑MS is greater than the number of available CTS‑FP radio resources.

The CTS-FP initiates the connectionless group alerting procedure by
broadcasting continuously a GROUP ALERTING REQUEST message on the CTSPCH
subchannel.. The CTSPCH indicator flag shall be set to
\"*CTSPCH to decode*\" and the CTSBCH‑SB Status field shall be set to
idle. Only connectionless group CTSMSI or Connectionless Broadcast
Identifier are allowed in a CTS GROUP ALERTING REQUEST message.

Upon receipt of a CTS GROUP ALERTING REQUEST, the CTS‑MS shall react as
following:

\- if group alerting was requested, the CTS‑MS shall alert if the
received connectionless group CTSMSI is equal to its assigned
connectionless group CTSMSI (if any);

\- if collective alerting was requested, the CTS‑MS shall start
alerting.

Alerted CTS‑MSs are required to receive and analyse the message sent on
the next CTSPCH. Unless the user accept the call, the CTS‑MS shall not
answer to this paging. When the user accept the call, the \"off hook\"
shall trigger an outgoing call request. The CTS-FP shall initiate the
immediate assignment procedure as specified in subclause 4.3.1. The
CTS‑FP shall suspend the connectionless paging procedure. The
establishment of the main signalling link is initiated by the use of an
SABM. The SETUP message shall be then passed to the CTS‑FP.

At the CTS‑FP, this outgoing call is directly mapped to the awaiting
incoming call.

The CTS-FP shall stop the connectionless group alerting procedure when:

\- the awaiting call is answered by a paged CTS-MS; or

\- the fixed line end user hangs up before the call is answered; or

\- the call is answered by another device (e.g. answering machine); or

\- the paging timer expires.

The connectionless group alerting procedure could be resumed if the call
establishment failed.

The CTS‑MSs shall consider that the connectionless group alerting
procedure has been ended by the CTS‑FP when CTS GROUP ALERTING REQUEST
message has not been received within the 3 latest occurrences of the
CTSPCH. The CTS-MSs shall stop alerting.

#### 4.2.2.5 CTS system information broadcasting

CTS SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 1, 2 or 3 may be broadcast by the CTS‑FP on
the CTSPCH channel.

CTS SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 1, 2 or 3 may be sent to the attached
CTS‑MSs when the TFH list or the TFH parameters need to be changed.

The information broadcast may be group in the following classes:

\- information about the frequency list to used;

\- information about the Total Frequency Hopping parameters to used.

4.3 RR connection establishment
-------------------------------

### 4.3.1 RR connection establishment initiated by the mobile station

The purpose of the immediate assignment procedure is to establish an RR
connection between the mobile station and the CTS‑FP.

#### 4.3.1.1 Entering the dedicated mode: immediate assignment procedure

The immediate assignment procedure can only be initiated by the RR
entity of the mobile station. Initiation is triggered by request from
the MM sublayer to enter the dedicated mode or by the RR entity in
response to a CTS PAGING REQUEST message. Upon such a request:

\- if access to the CTS‑FP is allowed (as defined in subclause
4.3.1.1.1), the RR entity of the mobile station initiates the immediate
assignment procedure as defined in subclause 4.3.1.1.2;

\- otherwise, it rejects the request.

The request from the MM sublayer to establish an RR connection specifies
an establishment cause. Similarly, the request from the RR entity to
establish a RR connection in response to a paging message specifies one
of the establishment causes \"answer to paging\".

##### 4.3.1.1.1 Permission to access the CTS‑FP

Access to the CTS-FP is allowed to any enrolled CTS‑MS when the CTSBCH
status field indicates idle. CTS‑MS shall not try to access the CTS‑FP
when the status field indicates busy and it shall continue to decode
CTSBCH and if needed CTSPCH or CTSAGCH.

##### 4.3.1.1.2 Initiation of the immediate assignment procedure

The RR entity of the CTS‑MS initiates the immediate assignment procedure
by scheduling the sending on the CTSARCH and leaving idle mode. It then
send maximally M~CTS~ + 1 CTS ACCESS REQUEST messages on the CTSARCH.

The CTS ACCESS REQUEST messages are sent on the non-hopping CTSARCH for
the enrolment and attachment MM-procedures and on the hopping CTSARCH
for the other cases. They contain as parameters:

\- an establishment cause which corresponds to the establishment causes
given by the MM sublayer or which corresponds to one of the
establishment causes \"answer to paging\" given by the RR entity in
response to a CTS PAGING REQUEST message;

\- the CTS‑MS Mobile Subscriber Identity.

After sending the first CTS ACCESS REQUEST, the CTS‑MS shall start
listening continuously to the CTSAGCH. After having sent M~CTS~ + 1
CTS ACCESS REQUEST messages, the CTS‑RR entity of the CTS‑MS shall start
timer T~C3150~. At expiry of this timer, the immediate assignment
procedure is aborted. If the immediate assignment procedure was
triggered by a request from the CTS‑MM sublayer, a access failure is
indicated to the CTS‑MM sublayer.

##### 4.3.1.1.3 Answer from the CTS-FP

##### 4.3.1.1.3.1 On receipt of a CTS ACCESS REQUEST message

The CTS‑FP may allocate a dedicated channel to the CTS‑MS by sending an
CTS IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT message in unacknowledged mode. Timer T~C3103~
is then started by the CTS‑RR layer of the CTS‑FP.

The CTS IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT message contains:

\- the access request reference (cause, CTSMSI);

\- the description of the dedicated channel;

\- optionally the multiframe number reference.

##### 4.3.1.1.3.2 Assignment rejection

If no channel is available for assignment, the CTS‑FP may send to the
CTS-MS a CTS IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT REJECT in unacknowledged mode in the
CTSAGCH channel. This message contains an access request reference and a
wait indication.

##### 4.3.1.1.4 Assignment completion

The immediate assignment procedure is terminated on the CTS‑FP side when
the main signalling link is established. Timer T~C3103~ is stopped and
the MM sublayer on the CTS-FP side is informed that the RR entity has
entered the dedicated mode.

On the mobile station side, the procedure is terminated when the
establishment of the main signalling link is confirmed. The MM sublayer
is informed that the RR entity has entered the dedicated mode.

##### 4.3.1.1.4.1 Early classmark sending

Early classmark sending consists in the mobile station sending as early
as possible after access a CTS CLASSMARK CHANGE message to provide the
CTS-FP with additional classmark information.

A mobile station which implements the \"Controlled Early Classmark
Sending\" option shall indicate it in the classmark (ES IND bit).

##### 4.3.1.1.5 Abnormal cases

If a lower layer failure occurs on the mobile station side on the new
channel before the successful establishment of the main signalling link,
the allocated channels are released; the subsequent behaviour of the
mobile station depends on the type of failure and previous actions.

\- If the failure is due to information field mismatch in the contention
resolution procedure, see subclause 4.1.5, and no repetition as
described in this paragraph has been performed, the immediate assignment
procedure shall be repeated.

\- If the failure is due to any other reason or if a repetition
triggered by a contention resolution failure has been performed. The
mobile station returns to idle mode (RR connection establishment
failure), transactions in progress are aborted and cell reselection then
may take place.

### 4.3.2 Paging procedure for RR connection establishment

The CTS-FP can initiate the establishment of an RR connection by the
paging procedure for RR connection establishment. Such a procedure can
only be initiated by the CTS‑FP.

#### 4.3.2.1 Paging initiation by the CTS-FP

The CTS-FP initiates the paging procedure by broadcasting a
CTS PAGING REQUEST message on the CTSPCH subchannel and starts timer
T~C3104~. The CTSPCH indicator flag shall be set to
\"*CTSPCH to decode*\" and the CTSBCH‑SB Status field shall be set to
idle.

A CTS PAGING REQUEST message may include more than one CTS‑MS
identification. Only Assigned Individual CTSMSIs or are allowed in a
CTS PAGING REQUEST message.

The CTS‑MS is required to receive and analyse the paging messages sent
on the CTSPCH according to the multiframe paging period.

#### 4.3.2.2 Paging response

Upon receipt of an CTS PAGING REQUEST, the addressed CTS-MS shall
initiate the immediate assignment procedure as specified in subclause
4.3.1 The establishment of the main signalling link is then initiated by
the use of an SABM with information field containing the paging response
message. The MM sublayer in the CTS‑MS is informed that an CTS‑RR
connection exists.

Upon receipt of the paging response message, timer T~C3104~ is stopped
and the MM sublayer in the CTS‑FP is informed that a CTS‑RR connection
exits.

#### 4.3.2.3 Abnormal cases

The CTS-FP shall abort the paging procedure when:

\- an end of paging procedure is triggered by the upper layer i.e.:

\- the fixed line end user hangs up before the call is answered; or

\- the call is answered by another device (e.g. answering machine); or

\- the call is forwarded; or

\- the paging timer expires.

If timer T~C3104~ expires and a valid CTS PAGING RESPONSE message has
not been received, a specific failure indication shall be triggered to
the upper layer and the CTS‑FP upper layer may repeat the paging
procedure.

4.4 Procedures in dedicated mode
--------------------------------

Procedures described in this subclause apply to the dedicated mode.

Direct transition between dedicated mode and group transmit mode is
possible in both directions by use of the following procedures:

\- Channel assignment procedure;

\- Channel mode modify procedure.

### 4.4.1 SACCH procedures

#### 4.4.1.1 General

In RR connected mode, the SACCH is used in signalling at least for
measurement results transmission from the CTS‑MS. Continuous
transmission must occur in both directions. For that purpose, in CTS‑MS
to CTS‑FP direction, measurement result messages are sent at each
possible occasion when nothing else has to be sent. Similarly, empty UI
frames are sent in the CTS‑FP to CTS‑MS direction when nothing else has
to be sent.

#### 4.4.1.2 Measurement report 

When in RR connected mode, the CTS‑MS regularly sends
CTS MEASURMENT REPORT messages to the CTS‑FP. These messages contain
measurement results about reception characteristics from the current
cell. They are sent on the slow ACCH, in unacknowledged mode. If no
other message is scheduled on the SACCH at the instant when a layer 2
frame is due to be sent, then the CTS‑MS shall send a
CTS MEASUREMENT REPORT message. The interval between two successive
layer 2 frame containing CTS MEASUREMENT REPORT messages shall not
exceed one layer 2 frame.

### 4.4.2 Transfer of messages and link layer service provision

When in dedicated mode or in group transmit mode, upper layers can send
messages in multiframe or unacknowledged mode on SAPI 0.

Moreover, but only when in dedicated mode, upper layers have access to
the full link layer services for SAPIs other than 0, with the exception
of the error indication and local end release that are directly treated
by the RR sublayer, as specified in particular places of clause 4.

### 4.4.3 Intracell handover procedure

In dedicated mode, an intracell change of channel can be requested by
upper layers for changing the channel type, or decided by the RR
sublayer, e.g. for an internal handover. This change may be performed
through the dedicated channel assignment procedure.

The purpose of the channel assignment procedure is to completely modify
the physical channel configuration of the mobile station without
frequency redefinition or change in synchronisation while staying in the
same CTS-cell.

This procedure shall not be used for changing between dependent
configurations, i.e. those sharing Radio Resource for the main
signalling link. An example of dependent channels is a full rate channel
and one of the corresponding half rate channels. In multislot operation
however, it is allowed to use the same timeslots before and after the
assignment, as long as the main signalling link has been changed. The
only procedures provided for changing between dependent configurations
for the main signalling link are the additional assignment and the
partial release procedures.

The channel assignment procedure happens only in dedicated mode. This
procedure cannot be used in the idle mode; in this case the immediate
assignment procedure is used.

The channel assignment procedure includes:

\- the suspension of normal operation except for RR management (layer
3);

\- the release of the main signalling link, and of the other data links
as defined in subclause 4.1.4, and the disconnection of TCHs if any;

\- the deactivation of previously assigned channels (layer 1);

\- the activation of the new channels and their connection if
applicable;

\- the triggering of the establishment of the data link connections for
SAPI = 0.

The channel assignment procedure is always initiated by the CTS‑FP.

#### 4.4.3.1 Intracell handover initiation

The CTS‑FP initiates the intracell handover procedure by sending a CTS
INTRACELL HANDOVER COMMAND message to the CTS‑MS on the main signalling
link. The CTS‑FP then starts timer T~C3105~. When sending this message
on the CTS‑FP side, and receiving it on the CTS‑MS side, all
transmission of signalling layer message except for those RR messages
needed for this procedure and for abnormal cases is suspended until
resumption is indicated.

Upon receipt of the CTS INTRACELL HANDOVER COMMAND message, the CTS-MS
initiates a local end release of link layer connections, disconnects the
physical channels, commands the switching to the assigned channel and
initiates the establishment of lower layer connections.

The CTS‑MS shall wait up to the starting time before accessing the
channel. If the starting time has already elapsed, the CTS‑MS shall
access the channel as an immediate reaction to the reception of the
message.

#### 4.4.3.2 Intracell handover completion

After the main signalling link is successfully established, the CTS‑MS
returns a CTS INTRACELL HANDOVER COMPLETE message specifying cause
\"normal event\'\' to the CTS‑FP on the main DCCH.

The sending of this message on the CTS‑MS side and its receipt on the
CTS‑FP side allow the resumption of the transmission of signalling layer
messages other than those belonging to RR management.

At the receipt of the CTS INTRACELL HANDOVER, the CTS‑FP releases the
previously allocated resources and stops timer TC3105.

#### 4.4.3.3 Abnormal cases

If the CTS INTRACELL HANDOVER COMMAND instruct the CTS‑MS to use a
parameter that it is not capable of, then the CTS-MS shall return a CTS
INTRACELL HANDOVER FAILURE message, and the CTS-MS shall remain on the
current channel(s) and use the old channel description or channel mode.

When receiving a CTS INTRACELL HANDOVER FAILURE message, the CTS‑FP
stops TC3105.

On the CTS‑FP side, if timer T~C3105~ elapses before either the CTS
INTRACELL HANDOVER COMPLETE message has been receive on the new channel
or a CTS INTRACELL HANDOVER FAILURE message is received or the CTS‑MS
has re-established the call, the old and the new channels are released
and all contexts related to the connection with that CTS‑MS are cleared.

### 4.4.4 Intercell handover procedure

Intercell handover is a CTS phase 2 issue.

### 4.4.5 Frequency hopping definition procedure

This procedure is used by the CTS‑FP to update the Total Frequency
Hopping List and Total Frequency Hopping parameters in the MS. The
CTS‑FP send a CTS FREQUENCY HOPPING DEFINITION message containing the
new parameters together with a reference time indication. The TFH
parameters are split in general static parameters and current dynamic
parameters which are valid for a given TDMA frame number. The values
indicated by the current parameters IE are those used by the TFH
algorithm at the frame number indicated by the reference time. These
parameters shall be used after the RR connection is released when the MS
is returning in idle mode.

### 4.4.6 Channel mode modify procedure

In dedicated mode, higher layers can request the setting of the channel
mode.

The channel mode modify procedure allows the CTS‑FP to request the
mobile station to set the channel mode for one channel or one channel
set. The channel mode covers the coding, decoding and transcoding mode
used on the indicated channel.

This procedure is always initiated by the CTS‑FP.

NOTE: Direct transitions between full rate speech coder version 1 and
full rate speech coder version 2 (and vice versa) may cause unpleasant
audio bursts.

#### 4.4.6.1 Normal channel mode modify procedure

##### 4.4.6.1.1 Initiation of the channel mode modify procedure

The FP initiates the procedure by sending a message CTS CHANNEL MODE
MODIFY to the CTS‑MS. This message contains:

\- a channel description of the channel(s) on which the specified mode
shall be applied; and

\- the mode to be used on that channel.

##### 4.4.6.1.2 Completion of channel mode modify procedure

When it has received the CTS CHANNEL MODE MODIFY message, the CTS‑MS
sets the mode for the indicated channel, and if that is in a multislot
configuration, the whole channel set and then replies by a CTS CHANNEL
MODE MODIFY ACKNOWLEDGE message indicating the ordered channel mode.

This applies whether the mode commanded by the CTS CHANNEL MODE MODIFY
message is different from the one used by the CTS‑MS or whether it is
already in use.

##### 4.4.6.1.3 Abnormal cases

No specific action for a lower layer failure is specified in this
subclause. If the mobile station does not support the indicated mode, it
shall retain the old mode and return the associated channel mode
information in CTS CHANNEL MODE MODIFY message.

### 4.4.7 Ciphering mode setting procedure

In dedicated mode, the ciphering mode setting procedure is used by the
FP to set the ciphering mode, i.e. whether or not the transmission is
ciphered, and if so which algorithm to use. The procedure shall only be
used to change from \"not ciphered\" mode to \"ciphered\" mode, or
vice-versa, or to pass a CTS CIPHERING MODE COMMAND message to the
mobile station while remaining in the \"not ciphered\" mode. The
ciphering mode setting procedure is always triggered by the FP and it
only applies to dedicated resources.

#### 4.4.7.1 Ciphering mode setting initiation

The CTS‑FP initiates the ciphering mode setting procedure by sending a
CTS CIPHERING MODE COMMAND message to the mobile station on the main
signalling link, indicating whether ciphering shall be used or not, and
if yes which algorithm to use.

The new mode is applied for reception on the CTS‑FP side after the
message has been sent.

#### 4.4.7.2 Ciphering mode setting completion

Whenever the CTS‑MS receives a CTS CIPHERING MODE COMMAND message, it
shall, if a SIM is present and considered valid by the mobile equipment
and the ciphering key sequence number stored on the SIM indicates that a
CTS ciphering key is available, load the ciphering key stored on the SIM
into the ME. A valid CTS CIPHERING MODE COMMAND message is defined to be
one of the following:

\- one that indicates \"start ciphering\" and is received by the mobile
station in the \"not ciphered\" mode;

\- one that indicates \"no ciphering\" and is received by the MS in the
\"not ciphered\" mode; or

\- one that indicates \"no ciphering\" and is received by the mobile
station in the \"ciphered\" mode.

Other CTS CIPHERING MODE COMMAND messages shall be regarded as
erroneous, an CTS RR STATUS message with cause \"Protocol error
unspecified\" shall be returned, and no further action taken.

Upon receipt of the CTS CIPHERING MODE COMMAND message indicating
ciphering, the mobile station shall start transmission and reception in
the indicated mode.

When the appropriate action on the CTS CIPHERING MODE COMMAND has been
taken, the mobile station sends back a CTS CIPHERING MODE COMPLETE
message. If the \"cipher response\" field of the cipher response
information element in the CTS CIPHERING MODE COMMAND message specified
\"IMEI must be included\" the mobile station shall include its IMEISV in
the CTS CIPHERING MODE COMPLETE message.

Upon receipt of the CTS CIPHERING MODE COMPLETE message or any other
correct layer 2 frame which was sent in the new mode, the CTS‑FP starts
transmission in the new mode.

### 4.4.8 \[Reserved: Additional channel assignment procedure\]

This is a CTS phase 2 issue.

### 4.4.9 \[Reserved: Partial channel release procedure\]

This is a CTS phase 2 issue.

### 4.4.10 Classmark change procedure

In dedicated mode, this procedure allows the mobile station to indicate
to the CTS‑FP a change of characteristics reflected in the classmark
(e.g. due to addition of power amplification). Furthermore, a mobile
station which implements the \"controlled early classmark sending\"
option may also send a CTS CLASSMARK CHANGE message as described in
subclause 4.3.1.1.4, even if no change of characteristics has occurred.

The mobile station sends a CTS CLASSMARK CHANGE message to the CTS‑FP.
This message contains the new mobile station classmark 2 information
element. It may also contain a Classmark 3 Information Element. There is
no acknowledgement from the CTS‑FP at layer 3.

### 4.4.11 Classmark interrogation procedure

This procedure allows the CTS‑FP to request additional classmark
information from the mobile station (e.g. if the information initially
sent by the mobile station is not sufficient for CTS‑FP decisions).

The CTS-FP initiate the classmark interrogation procedure by sending a
CTS CLASSMARK ENQUIRY message to the CTS‑MS on the main DCCH.

on receipt of the CTS CLASSMARK ENQUIRY message, the CTS‑MS sends a CTS
CLASSMARK CHANGE message to the CTS‑FP on the main DCCH.

### 4.4.12 \[Reserved\]

### 4.4.13 RR connection release procedure

#### 4.4.13.1 Normal release procedure

The release of the RR connection can be requested by upper layers.

The purpose of this procedure is to deactivate all the dedicated
channels in use for this RR connection. When the channels are released,
the mobile station returns to the idle mode. The channel release
procedure can be used in a variety of cases, including TCH release after
a call release, and DCCH release when a dedicated channel allocated for
signalling is released.

In dedicated mode, the channel release procedure is always initiated by
the CTS‑FP.

##### 4.4.13.1.1 Channel release procedure initiation

The CTS-FP initiates the channel release procedure by sending a CTS
CHANNEL RELEASE message to the CTS-MS on the main DCCH, starts timer
T~C3106~ and deactivates the SACCH.

On receipt of a CTS CHANNEL RELEASE message, the CTS-MS starts timer
T~C3151~ and disconnect the main signalling link. When TC3151 times out
or when the disconnection is confirmed, the CTS‑MS deactivates all
signalling link, considers the RR connection as released, and returns to
idle mode.

On CTS‑FP side, when the main signalling link is disconnected, the
CTS-FP stops timer TC3106 and starts timer TC3107. When timer TC3107
times out, the CTS-FP deactivates the channels. If timer TC3106 times
out, the CTS‑FP deactivates the channels.

##### 4.4.13.1.2 Abnormal case

Abnormal cases are taken into account in the main part of the
description of the procedure.

#### 4.4.13.2 Radio link fai2lure in dedicated mode

The main part of these procedures concerns the \"normal\" cases, i.e.
those without any occurrence of loss of communication means. A separate
paragraph at the end of the description of each procedure treats the
cases of loss of communication, called a radio link failure. In
dedicated mode, in most of the cases the reaction of the mobile station
or the CTS-FP is the same. Those reactions are described in this
subclause to avoid repetitions.

A radio link failure can be detected by several ways:

1\) by analysis of reception at layer 1, as specified in GSM 05.08 and
subclause 4.4.1.1;

2\) by a data link layer failure as specified in GSM 04.06, on the main
signalling link. A data link failure on any other data link shall not be
considered as a radio link failure;

3\) when a lower layer failure happens while the mobile station attempts
to connect back to the old channels in a channel assignment procedure or
handover procedure;

4\) in some cases where timers are started to detect the lack of answer
from the other party, as described in clause 3.

The two first cases are known by the term \"lower layer failure\".

##### 4.4.13.2.1 Mobile side

When a radio link failure is detected by the mobile station:

‑ the MS shall perform a local end release on all signalling links
unless otherwise specified;

‑ the mobile station shall deactivate all channels;

‑ the RR sublayer of the mobile station shall indicate an RR connection
failure to the MM sublayer unless otherwise specified.

NOTE: Upper layers may decide on a re-establishment (see subclause
5.5.4).

##### 4.4.13.2.2 CTS-FP side

When a radio link failure has been detected, an indication is passed to
the upper sublayer on CTS‑FP side.

The CTS‑FP should release the connection except when otherwise
specified, either with the channel release procedure as specified in
subclause 4.4.13.1 or with the following procedure. The CTS‑FP start
timer TC3106 and deactivates the SACCH and hence stops transmission on
the SACCH. When timer TC3106 expires, the CTS-FP can regard the channel
as released.

NOTE: The CTS‑FP The network should maintain for a while the transaction
context in order to allow call re‑establishment.

#### 4.4.13.3 RR connection abortion in dedicated mode

The mobile station aborts the RR connection by initiating a normal
release of the main signalling link, performing local end releases on
all other signalling links and disconnecting all traffic channels, if
any.

### 4.4.14 Receiving CTS RR STATUS message by a CTS-RR entity

If the CTS‑RR entity of the mobile station receives a CTS RR STATUS
message no transition and no specific action shall be taken as seen from
the radio interface, i.e. local actions are possible.

The actions to be taken on receiving a CTS RR STATUS message in the
CTS‑FP are defined in GSM 04.08. See also clause 8.

### 4.4.15 CTS RR parameters update

This procedure allows the CTS-FP to provide mandatory parameters to the
mobile station. It shall be initiated during enrolment and attachment
MM-procedures.

The CTS-FP sends the CTS RR PARAMETERS UPDATE message containing the
relevant parameters.

5 Elementary procedures for Mobility Management
===============================================

5.1 General
-----------

This subclause describes the procedures used for mobility management at
the CTS radio interface (Reference Point Um\*).

The general purpose of CTS Mobility Management sublayer is to support
the mobility of the mobile stations, such as informing the fixed part of
its presence and providing user identity confidentiality. The CTS‑MM
sublayer provides also connection management services to the different
entities of the upper Connection Management (CM) sublayer.

All the CTS‑MM procedures can only be performed if a CTS-RR connection
has been established between the mobile station and the fixed part. If
no CTS‑RR connection is currently established, the CTS‑MM sublayer has
to initiate such establishment.

Depending of the CTS‑MM procedure, they can be initiated either by the
mobile station or by the fixed part or even indifferently by one of the
two parties.

The CTS-FP may also start all mobility management procedures defined in
GSM 04.08, including:

\- the GSM authentication procedure;

\- the GSM identity request procedure.

The messages defined in GSM 04.08 shall be used for these procedures.

### 5.1.1 Type of CTS-MM procedures

Depending on how they can be initiated, two types of CTS-MM procedures
can be distinguished:

\(i\) CTS-MM common procedures:

A CTS-MM common procedure can always be initiated whilst a CTS-RR
connection exists. The procedures belonging to this type are:

\- Initiated by the fixed part:

\- CTS mutual authentication procedure;

\- CTSMSI update procedure;

\- CTS de-enrolment procedure.

\- Initiated by the mobile station

\- CTS detach procedure.

\(ii\) CTS-MM specific procedures:

A CTS-MM specific procedure can only be initiated if no other MM
specific procedure is running or no MM connection exists. The procedures
belonging to this type are:

\- Initiated by the mobile station:

\- CTS enrolment procedure;

\- CTS attach procedure;

\- CTS re-attach procedure.

\- Initiated by the fixed part:

\- CTS periodic attach update procedure.

These running procedures do not preclude from running procedures defined
in the CTS supervising system layer 3 specification.

### 5.1.2 CTS-MM sublayer states

#### 5.1.2.1 CTS-MM sublayer states in the mobile station

An additional machine describes the states related to the CTS.

##### 5.1.2.1.1 Main states

1\. WAIT FOR CTS-RR ACTIVE

The CTS-MM sublayer has requested activation of the CTS-RR sublayer.

2\. WAIT FOR CTS-RR CONNECTION (ENROLMENT OR ATTACH)

The CTS-MM sublayer has requested CTS-RR connection establishment for
starting the enrolment procedure or the attach one.

3\. ATTACH INITIATED

The attach procedure has been started and the CTS-MM awaits a response
from the fixed part. The timer TC3250 is running.

4\. ENROLMENT INITIATED

The enrolment procedure has been started and the CTS-MM awaits a
response from the fixed part. The timer TC3254 is running.

5\. ATTACH REJECTED

The attach procedure has been rejected and CTS-RR connection release is
awaited. The timer TC3256 is running.

6\. ENROLMENT REJECTED

The enrolment procedure has been rejected and CTS-RR connection release
is awaited.

7\. AUTHENTICATION INITIATED

The mutual authentication procedure has been started by the fixed part.

8\. CTS-MM IDLE

There is no MM procedure running and no RR connection exist. This is a
compound state.

##### 5.1.2.1.2 Substates of the CTS-MM IDLE state

8.1 NORMAL SERVICE

The mobile station is attached to a fixed part and it is reachable.

8.2 FP SEARCH

The mobile station is searching for fixed parts on which the mobile
station is enrolled.

8.3 NO FP AVAILABLE

No fixed part can be selected. This state is entered after a first
intensive search failed. Fixed parts are searched at a low rhythm. No
CTS services are offered.

#### 5.1.2.2 CTS-MM sublayer states in the fixed part

1\. IDLE

The CTS-MM sublayer is not active.

2\. WAIT FOR CTS-RR CONNECTION

The CTS-MM sublayer has requested activation of the CTS-RR sublayer.

3\. CTS-MM CONNECTION ACTIVE

The CTS-MM sublayer has a CTS-RR connection to a mobile station. One or
more MM connections are active.

4\. CTS AUTHENTICATION INITIATED

The authentication procedure has been started by the fixed part.

5\. CTS DE-ENROLMENT INITIATED

The de-enrolment procedure has been started by the fixed part.

6\. CTS CIPHERING MODE INITIATED

The cipher mode setting procedure has been requested to the
CTS-RR-sublayer.

5.2 CTS-MM common procedures
----------------------------

### 5.2.1 CTS detach procedure

The purpose of the CTS detach procedure is to detach a mobile station
from a fixed part. The mobile station may launch the detach procedure
during the CTS mode deactivation (e.g. at the power off, when the SIM is
extracted, when the mobile station is set in GSM mode only).

The CTS detach procedure is always initiated by the mobile station.

#### 5.2.1.1 CTS detach initiation by the mobile station

The mobile station initiates the CTS detach procedure by sending a CTS
DETACH INDICATION to the fixed part. The mobile station then starts
timer TC3253.

If no RR connection exists, the MM sublayer within the mobile station
will request the RR sublayer to establish a RR connection. If a RR
connection exists, the MM sublayer will release locally any ongoing MM
connections before the CTS DETACH INDICATION message is sent.

#### 5.2.1.2 CTS detach procedure in the fixed part

On reception of a CTS DETACH INDICATION, the fixed part shall consider
the mobile station as detached. No response is returned to the mobile
station. After reception of the CTS DETACH INDICATION message, the fixed
part shall release locally any ongoing MM connections, and start the
normal RR connection release procedure.

#### 5.2.1.3 CTS detach completion by the mobile station

Timer TC3253 is stopped when the RR connection is released. The mobile
station should, if possible, delay the local release of the channel to
allow a normal release from the fixed part until TC3253. If this is not
possible (e.g. detach at power down) the RR sublayer on the mobile side
should be aborted.

#### 5.2.1.4 Abnormal cases

If establishment of an RR connection is not possible, or the RR
connection is lost, the CTS detach procedure is aborted by the mobile
station.

### 5.2.2 CTS de-enrolment procedure

The purpose of the CTS de-enrolment procedure is to inform a CTS MS that
it is no more enrolled on this CTS-FP.

The CTS de-enrolment procedure is always launched by the fixed part.

This procedure shall be launched when the mobile station has no more
right to be enrolled (e.g. expiration of validity period, de-enrolment
requested by the CTS operator). Any reference to this mobile station
should be removed in the fixed part.

#### 5.2.2.1 CTS de-enrolment initiation by the fixed part

The fixed part initiates the CTS de-enrolment procedure by sending a CTS
DE-ENROLMENT INDICATION to the mobile station. Then the fixed part will
request the RR sublayer to release the RR connection.

#### 5.2.2.2 CTS de-enrolment procedure in the mobile station

On reception of a CTS DE-ENROLMENT INDICATION, the CTS-MS shall remove
the corresponding CTS-FP of the list of the fixed parts on which the
mobile station is enrolled.

The mobile station should inform the user that it is no more enrolled on
this CTS-FP.

#### 5.2.2.3 Abnormal cases

If establishment of an RR connection is not possible, or the RR
connection is lost, the CTS de-enrolment procedure is aborted by the
fixed part. Nevertheless, any reference to the corresponding mobile
station should be removed in the fixed part.

### 5.2.3 CTS mutual authentication procedure

The purpose of the CTS mutual authentication procedure is:

\- to permit the fixed part to check whether the identity provided by
the mobile station is acceptable or not (see GSM 03.20 annex E);

\- to permit the mobile station to check whether the identity provided
by the fixed part is acceptable or not (see GSM 03.20 annex E);

\- to agree on required parameters between the fixed part and mobile
station to calculate a new ciphering key (see GSM 03.20 annex E).

The authentication procedure uses the CTSMSI if it is available. If it
is not available or if the authentication fails using this identity, the
authentication procedure shall be started again using the IMSI.

The CTS authentication procedure is always initiated by the CTS-FP on
the radio interface.

This procedure shall be used each time an enrolment procedure or an
attach procedure is started.

#### 5.2.3.1 CTS authentication initiation by the fixed part

The fixed part initiates the CTS authentication procedure by sending a
CTS MS AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message to the CTS-MS and starts the timer
TC3211.

The CTS MS AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message specifies the authentication
parameter.

#### 5.2.3.2 CTS authentication response by the mobile station

The mobile station shall be ready to respond upon a CTS MS
AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message at any time whilst a CTS-RR connection
exists.

On reception of a CTS MS AUTHENTICATION REQUEST from the fixed part, the
mobile station shall send a CTS MS AUTHENTICATION RESPONSE and starts
the timer TC3260.

The CTS MS AUTHENTICATION RESPONSE message specifies the authentication
parameter CH2 and the authentication parameter SRES1.

#### 5.2.3.3 CTS authentication processing by the fixed part

On reception of the CTS MS AUTHENTICATION RESPONSE from the mobile
station, the fixed part shall stop the timer TC3211 and shall check the
validity of the response (see GSM 03.20 annex E).

The fixed part shall respond with a CTS FP AUTHENTICATION RESPONSE
message. This message specifies the authentication parameter SRES2.

#### 5.2.3.4 CTS authentication completion by the mobile station

On reception of the CTS FP AUTHENTICATION RESPONSE from the fixed part,
the mobile station shall stop the timer TC3260 and shall check the
validity of the response (see GSM 03.20 annex E).

#### 5.2.3.5 Unsuccessful authentication

If mobile station authentication fails, i.e. the response given by the
mobile station is not valid, the fixed part may distinguish between the
two different ways of identification: IMSI or CTSMSI. If the mobile
station identifies itself using the CTSMSI, the fixed part may request
the IMSI using the identity request procedure and may start a new mutual
authentication procedure using the IMSI.

If the fixed part does not start a new authentication procedure, it
shall sent a CTS MS AUTHENTICATION REJECT message to the mobile station.
After having sent this message, the fixed part shall release any ongoing
MM connections and shall initiate the RR connection release procedure.
If fixed part authentication fails, i.e. the response given by the fixed
part is not valid, the mobile station may abort the RR connection. In
this case, the CTS-MS shall abort any MM ongoing procedure.

#### 5.2.3.6 Abnormal cases

Fixed part side

\(a\) CTS-RR connection failure

Upon a detection of a CTS-RR connection failure before the CTS MS
AUTHENTICATION RESPONSE is received, the fixed part shall release all MM
connections (if any) and abort any ongoing MM specific procedure.

\(b\) Expiry of timer TC3211

The mutual authentication procedure is supervised on the fixed part by
the timer TC3211. At expiry of this timer the fixed part may release the
CTS-RR connection. In this case the fixed part shall abort the mutual
authentication procedure and any ongoing MM specific procedure, release
all MM connections if any, and initiate the CTS-RR connection release
procedure described in subclause 4.4.13.

Mobile station side

\(a\) CTS-RR connection failure

Upon a detection of a CTS-RR connection failure before the CTS FP
AUTHENTICATION RESPONSE is received, the mobile station shall release
all MM connections (if any) and abort any ongoing MM specific procedure.

\(b\) Expiry of timer TC3260

The mutual authentication procedure is supervised on the mobile station
by the timer TC3260. At expiry of this timer the mobile station may
abort the CTS-RR connection. In this case the mobile station shall abort
the mutual authentication procedure and any ongoing MM specific
procedure, release all MM connections if any, and initiate the CTS-RR
connection release procedure described in subclause 4.4.13.

### 5.2.4 CTSMSI update procedure

The purpose of the CTSMSI update procedure is to provide identity
confidentiality, i.e. to protect a user against being identified and
located by an intruder (see GSM 03.20 annex E).

The CTSMSI update procedure is always initiated by the CTS-FP on the
radio interface.

The structure of the CTSMSI is specified in GSM 03.03. The CTSMSI has
significance only for a specific CTS-FP.

The CTSMSI update procedure shall be performed after each access to the
fixed part done by a mobile station

#### 5.2.4.1 CTSMSI update initiation by the fixed part

The fixed part initiates the CTSMSI update procedure by sending a CTSMSI
UPDATE COMMAND message to the CTS-MS and starts the timer TC3202.

The CTSMSI UPDATE COMMAND message specifies the new CTSMSI of the mobile
station. The CTSMSI UPDATE COMMAND message shall be sent to the mobile
station using a CTS-RR connection in ciphering mode (see GSM 03.20 annex
E).

#### 5.2.4.2 CTSMSI update response by the mobile station

Upon receipt of the CTSMSI UPDATE COMMAND message the mobile station
stores the new CTSMSI related to the corresponding fixed part in the
SIM.

The mobile station sends a CTSMSI UPDATE COMPLETE message to the fixed
part.

#### 5.2.4.3 CTSMSI update completion in the fixed part

Upon receipt of the CTSMSI UPDATE COMPLETE message the fixed part stops
the timer TC3202 and considers the new CTSMSI as valid.

#### 5.2.4.4 Abnormal cases

Mobile station side:

Any CTS-RR connection failure after storage of the new CTSMSI value in
the SIM does not have any impact on this storage.

Fixed part side

\(a\) CTS-RR connection failure:

If the CTS-RR connection is lost before the CTSMSI UPDATE COMPLETE
message is received, all MM connections (if any) shall be released and
both the old and the new CTSMSIs should be maintained in order to be
able to recover from unsuccessful CTSMSI update.

\(b\) No response from the mobile station (expiry of timer TC3202)

The fixed part should maintain the old and the new CTSMSI in order to be
able to recover from unsuccessful CTSMSI update.

5.3 CTS-MM specific procedures
------------------------------

### 5.3.1 CTS enrolment procedure

The purpose of the CTS enrolment procedure is:

\- to define an association between a certain CTS-MS and a certain
CTS-FP;

\- to ensure the rights of the CTS-MS to use CTS services on this
CTS-FP.

The CTS enrolment procedure is always initiated by the mobile station.

The user shall provide the CTS-PIN (see GSM 03.20 annex E) on the mobile
station and shall take a physical action on the CTS-FP.

#### 5.3.1.1 CTS enrolment initiation by the mobile station

The mobile station initiates the CTS enrolment procedure by sending a
CTS ENROLMENT REQUEST message to the CTS-FP. The mobile station shall
start the timer TC3254.

#### 5.3.1.2 CTS enrolment completion by the fixed part

After mutual authentication, the fixed part shall request the mobile
station identity to perform the verification of its rights to use CTS
services on this fixed part. This verification is done either locally by
the fixed part or by the CTS operator via the Cf interface (see GSM
03.20 annex E). Upon these rights are verified, the CTS-FP shall enrol
the CTS-MS and shall send a CTS ENROLMENT ACCEPT to the mobile station.
The CTS ENROLMENT ACCEPT contains the identity of the fixed part (IFPSI
or IFPEI), and the first CTSMSI value of the mobile station.

#### 5.3.1.3 CTS enrolment completion by the mobile station

On reception of a CTS ENROLMENT ACCEPT, the CTS-MS shall stop the timer
TC3254 and enters in CTS MM IDLE state.

#### 5.3.1.4 Unsuccessful enrolment

If the mobile station has not the rights to be enrolled, the fixed part
shall send a CTS ENROLMENT REJECT message to the mobile station. This
message contains a reject cause and the identity of the fixed part.

On reception of a CTS ENROLMENT REJECT, the CTS-MS shall stop the timer
TC3254 and enters in ENROLMENT REJECTED state.

#### 5.3.1.5 Abnormal cases

\(a\) CTS-RR connection failure

If the CTS-RR connection is lost before the CTS ENROLMENT ACCEPT message
is received, the enrolment procedure has failed. A new enrolment attempt
may be done by the user.

\(b\) No response from the fixed part (expiry of timer TC3254)

The mobile station should warn the mobile station user. A new enrolment
attempt may be done by the user.

### 5.3.2 CTS attach procedure

The purpose of the CTS attach procedure is to attach the corresponding
mobile station to a specific fixed part. Before performing the attach
procedure, the corresponding mobile station has to be enrolled on this
fixed part.

The attach procedure is always initiated by the mobile station.

#### 5.3.2.1 CTS attach initiation by the mobile station

The mobile station initiates the CTS attach procedure by sending a CTS
ATTACH REQUEST message to the CTS-FP and starts the timer TC3250.

The CTS ATTACH REQUEST message specifies the CTSMSI, and the classmark
of the mobile station.

#### 5.3.2.2 CTS attach completion by the fixed part

If the mobile identity corresponds to an enrolled mobile station on the
CTS-FP, the fixed part shall send a CTS ATTACH ACCEPT to the mobile
station.

If the mobile station sends its CTSMSI as identity and it does not
correspond to any enrolled mobile station, the fixed part could use the
identity request procedure (see GSM 04.08) to obtain the IMSI of the
mobile station. If the IMSI corresponds to an enrolled mobile station,
the fixed part shall complete the attachment as described before.

The fixed part shall send a CTS ATTACH REJECT with its identity (IFPSI
or IFPEI) when the mobile shall not be attached:

\- the mobile station is not enrolled on this fixed part: the reject
cause shall be \#4 (IMSI unknown in VLR);

\- the fixed part is not able to complete all the operations it has to
perform at mobile station attachment (e.g. FMC registration).

#### 5.3.2.3 CTS attach completion by the mobile station

On reception of a CTS ATTACH ACCEPT, the mobile station shall stop the
timer TC3250 and shall start the timer TC3252.

The CTS-MS enters in CTS MM IDLE state.

#### 5.3.2.4 CTS attach rejection treatment by the mobile station

On reception of a CTS ATTACH REJECT, the mobile station shall verify if
the CTS-FP identity (IFPSI or IFPEI) is the expected one and shall stop
the timer TC3250.

If the fixed part identity is the expected one and the reject cause is
equal to \#4 (IMSI unknown in VLR), the mobile station shall not
re-attempt to attach automatically to the same fixed part. The CTS-MS
should inform the user that it is no more enrolled on this fixed part.

If the fixed part identity is the expected one and the reject cause is
different of \#4, the mobile station shall not attempt to attach to any
fixed part having the same FPBI before expiration of the timer TC3257.

If the fixed part identity is not the expected one, the mobile station
shall start the timer TC3256. The mobile shall not attempt to attach to
any fixed part having the same FPBI before expiration of the timer
TC3256. This does not forbid attachment attempts to fixed parts having
an other FPBI.

#### 5.3.2.5 Abnormal cases

\(a\) CTS-RR connection failure:

Upon a detection of a CTS-RR connection failure before the CTS ATTACH
ACCEPT is received, the mobile station shall abort the ongoing attach
procedure and shall stop the timer TC3250.

\(b\) No response from the fixed part (expiry of TC3250 timer):

The mobile station shall start the timer TC3251. The mobile station
shall not re-attempt to attach again to the same fixed part before
expiry of timer TC3251.

### 5.3.3 CTS re-attach procedure

The purpose of the CTS re-attach procedure is to inform the presence of
a mobile station to the fixed part on which it is attached.

The CTS re-attach procedure is always started by the mobile station.

This procedure is started at expiry of the timer TC3252.

#### 5.3.3.1 CTS re-attach initiation by the mobile station

The mobile station initiates the CTS re-attach procedure by sending a
CTS ATTACH REQUEST message with an indication of re-attachment to the
CTS‑FP and starts the timer TC3255.

#### 5.3.3.2 CTS re-attach completion by the fixed part

On reception of a CTS ATTACH REQUEST message with an indication of
re-attachment, the fixed part shall respond with a CTS ATTACH ACCEPT and
shall start again the CTS periodic attach update procedure (see
subclause 5.3.4).

#### 5.3.3.3 Abnormal cases

\(a\) RR connection failure:

Upon a detection of a RR connection failure before the CTS ATTACH ACCEPT
is received, the mobile station shall consider to be detached from the
fixed part.

\(b\) RR not available:

If no radio resource is currently available on the fixed part (STATUS
field set to busy in the BCH-SB), the timer TC3252 shall be started
again with its initial value.

\(c\) Expiry of timer TC3255

The mobile station shall be considered to be detached of the
corresponding fixed part.

### 5.3.4 CTS periodic attach update procedure

The purpose of the CTS periodic attach update procedure is to verify the
presence of the attached mobile stations.

The CTS periodic attach update procedure is started by the fixed part
when it enters the MM IDLE state.

#### 5.3.4.1 CTS periodic attach update procedure behaviour in the fixed part

At the begin of this procedure, the timer TC3201 is started.

At expiry of TC3201, the MM sublayer shall trigger the RR sublayer to
launch the alive check procedure (see subclause 4.2.2.3) with the CTSMSI
corresponding to the mobile.

The fixed part can trigger up to NC320 times the alive check procedure
using the same CTSMSI. At the next expiry of TC3201, the fixed part
shall launch the CTSMSI update procedure instead of the alive check.

#### 5.3.4.2 Abnormal cases

After alive check triggering done by MM, the following abnormal cases
may occur:

\(a\) RR not available

The fixed part shall start again the timer TC3201 with its initial
value.

\(b\) No response from the mobile station

The fixed part shall considered that the mobile station is detached.

6 Elementary procedures for circuit-switched Call Control
=========================================================

6.1 Overview
------------

### 6.1.1 General

This subclause describes the Call Control (CC) protocol, which is one of
the protocols of the Connection Management (CM) sublayer (see
GSM 04.07).

As a general rule, the CC protocol on the CTS radio interface Um\* is
the same as the one used in the GSM radio interface Um. However, several
specific procedures are introduced: the hook flash procedure and the
internal call procedure.

6.2 Hook flash procedure
------------------------

The hook flash is used for the control of some fixed-line supplementary
services, associated with DTMF tones.

The mobile station shall be capable of transmitting hook flash request
with the same conditions as the ones required for DTMF transmission but
only on the Um\* interface. The hook flash itself is generated by the
CTS-FP on the fixed line. As a general rule, the hook flash procedure is
the same procedure as the one used to perform DTMF transmission except
that a specific keypad value is used. The DTMF protocol control
procedure is defined in GSM 04.08.

### 6.2.1 Hook flash request by the mobile station

A user may cause a hook flash to be generated e.g. by depression of a
key in the mobile station. The relevant action is interpreted by the
mobile station as a requirement for a hook flash to be sent in a START
DTMF message on an established FACCH.

### 6.2.2 Hook flash response by the fixed part

Upon receiving the START DTMF message indicating \"hook flash\", the
fixed part shall generate a hook flash on the fixed line and shall
return a START DTMF ACKNOWLEDGE message to the mobile station indicating
successful initiation of the procedure.

If the fixed line can not accept the hook flash (e.g. ISDN), a START
DTMF REJECT message shall be sent to the mobile station.

### 6.2.3 Stop hook flash request by the mobile station

When the user indicates that the hook flash generation should cease e.g.
by releasing the key the mobile station will send a STOP DTMF message to
the fixed part.

### 6.2.4 Stop hook flash response by fixed part

After receiving the STOP DTMF message the fixed part returns a STOP DTMF
ACKNOWLEDGE message to the mobile station when it has finished to
generate the hook flash on the fixed line.

NOTE 1: The Fixed Part may implement the time limit option where the
hook flash duration is controlled by the Fixed Part irrespective of the
receipt of a stop hook flash request from the mobile station. The
maximum duration of the hook flash to be generated on the fixed line is
outside the scope of the present document and may be determined by
specific regulations.

NOTE 2: The Fixed Part shall ensure that the minimum length of hook
flash and minimum gap between hook flash and tones according to specific
regulations are fulfilled.

6.3 Internal call procedure
---------------------------

To perform a internal call, the same procedure as the one used to
perform a normal call shall be used except that the internal numbering
plan is used.

7 Examples of structured procedures
===================================

Clause 7 is informative.

7.1 General
-----------

Clause 7 contains examples of how the fixed part may group together the
elementary procedures (i.e. the procedures defined in clauses 3 to 5) in
order to provide normal service.

### 7.1.1 CTS paging request

The paging procedure is used to page a mobile station to which a
connection shall be established.

Upon receipt of a CTS PAGING REQUEST message the addressed mobile
station initiates the immediate assignment procedure.

Mobile Station Fixed Part

CTS PAGING REQUEST

\<───────────────────────────────────────

Figure 7.1/GSM 04.56: CTS paging request

### 7.1.2 CTS immediate assignment

The CTS immediate assignment procedure is always initiated by the mobile
station. It may be triggered by a CTS paging request or by a mobile
originating service request.

The mobile station sends a CTS ACCESS REQUEST message on the Access
Request Channel. The fixed part responds with a CTS IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT
message on the CTS Access Grant Channel.

The purpose of CTS mutual authentication procedure is to validate the
identity provided by the mobile station and the one provided by the
fixed part. It is initiated by the fixed part. The CTS mutual
authentication procedure also provides the mobile station with
information from which a new ciphering key can be derived. The fixed
part shall use the CTS mutual authentication at the beginning of each MM
connection establishment (see GSM 03.20 annex E).

8 Handling of unknown, unforeseen, and erroneous protocol data
==============================================================

8.1 General
-----------

The procedures specified in GSM 04.56 and call-related supplementary
service handling in GSM 04.10 apply to those messages which pass the
checks described in this subclause.

This subclause also specifies procedures for the handling of unknown,
unforeseen, and erroneous protocol data by the receiving entity. These
procedures are called \"error handling procedures\", but in addition to
providing recovery mechanisms for error situations they define a
compatibility mechanism for future extensions of the protocols.

Error handling concerning the value part of the Facility IE and of the
SS Version Indicator IE are not in the scope of the present document. It
is defined in GSM 04.10 and the GSM 04.8x series.

Subclauses 8.1 to 8.8 shall be applied in order of precedence.

Most error handling procedures are mandatory for the CTS‑MS.

Detailed error handling procedures in the CTS‑FP are implementation
dependent and may vary. However, when extensions of this protocol are
developed, CTS-FP will be assumed to have the error handling that is
indicated in this subclause as mandatory (\"shall\") and that is
indicated as strongly recommended (\"should\"). Subclauses 8.2, 8.3,
8.4, 8.5 and 8.7.2 do not apply to the error handling in the CTS‑FP
applied to the receipt of initial layer 3 message: If the CTS-FP
diagnoses an error described in one of these subclauses in the initial
layer 3 message received from the CTS‑MS, it shall either:

\- try to recognise the classmark and then take further implementation
dependent actions; or

\- release the RR-connection.

Also, the error handling of the CTS‑FP is only considered as mandatory
or strongly recommended when certain thresholds for errors are not
reached during a dedicated connection.

In this subclause the following terminology is used:

\- An IE is defined to be syntactically incorrect in a message if it
contains at least one value defined as \"reserved\" in clause 10, or if
its value part violates rules of clause 10. However it is not a
syntactical error that a type 4 IE specifies in its length indicator a
greater length than defined in clause 10.

\- A message is defined to have semantically incorrect contents if it
contains information which, possibly dependent on the state of the
receiver, is in contradiction to the resources of the receiver and/or to
the procedural part (i.e. clauses 4 and 5) of GSM 04.58, GSM 04.10, or
relevant GSM 04.8X series.

8.2 Message too short
---------------------

When a message is received that is too short to contain a complete
message type information element, that message shall be ignored, see
GSM 04.07.

8.3 Unknown or unforeseen transaction identifier
------------------------------------------------

See GSM 04.08 clause 8.3. The CTS-FP shall act as the \"network\",
whereas it is stated so.

8.4 Unknown or unforeseen message type
--------------------------------------

If a CTS‑MS receives a message with message type not defined for the PD
and SPD or not implemented by the receiver in unacknowledged mode, it
shall ignore the message.

If a CTS‑MS receives a message with message type not defined for the PD
and SPD or not implemented by the receiver in acknowledged mode, it
shall return a status message (STATUS, CTS RR STATUS or MM STATUS
depending on the protocol discriminator and sub-protocol discriminator)
with cause \# 97 \"message type non-existent or not implemented\".

If the CTS‑FP receives an RR message or MM message with message type not
defined for the PD or not implemented by the receiver in a protocol
state where reception of an unsolicited message with the given PD from
the CTS‑MS is not foreseen in the protocol, the CTS‑FP actions are
implementation dependent. Otherwise, if the CTS-FP receives a message
with message type not defined for the PD and the SPD or not implemented
by the receiver, it shall ignore the message except that it should
return a status message (STATUS, CTS RR STATUS or MM STATUS depending on
the protocol discriminator and Sub-Protocol Discriminator) with cause
\#97 \"message type non-existent or not implemented\".

NOTE: A message type not defined for the PD and SPD in the given
direction is regarded by the receiver as a message type not defined for
the PD and SPD, see GSM 04.07 \[20\].

If the CTS‑MS receives a message not compatible with the protocol state,
the CTS‑MS shall ignore the message except for the fact that, if an RR
connection exists, it returns a status message (STATUS, CTS RR STATUS or
MM STATUS depending on the protocol discriminator and sub-protocol
discriminator) with cause \#98 \"Message type not compatible with
protocol state\".

If the CTS‑FP receives a message not compatible with the protocol state,
the CTS‑FP actions are implementation dependent.

8.5 Non-semantical mandatory information element errors
-------------------------------------------------------

When on receipt of a message:

\- an \"imperative message part\" error; or

\- a \"missing mandatory IE\" error;

is diagnosed or when a message containing:

\- a syntactically incorrect mandatory IE; or

\- an IE unknown in the message, but encoded as \"comprehension
required\" (see subclause 10.5); or

\- an out of sequence IE encoded as \"comprehension required\" (see
subclause 10.5)

is received,

\- the CTS‑MS station shall proceed as follows:

If the message is not one of the messages listed in subclauses 8.5.1,
8.5.2, and 8.5.3, the CTS‑MS shall ignore the message except for the
fact that, if an RR connection exists, it shall return a status message
(STATUS, CTS RR STATUS or MM STATUS depending on the protocol
discriminator and sub-protocol discriminator) with cause \# 96 \"invalid
mandatory information\".

\- the CTS‑FP shall proceed as follows:

When the message is not one of the messages listed in subclause 8.5.3
b), c), d) or e), the CTS‑FP shall either

\- try to treat the message (the exact further actions are
implementation dependent); or

\- ignore the message except that it should return a status message
(STATUS, CTS RR STATUS, or MM STATUS depending on the protocol
discriminator and sub-protocol discriminator) with cause \# 96 \"invalid
mandatory information\".

### 8.5.1 Radio resource management

For the CTS‑MS the following procedures shall apply:

\- If the message is a CTS CHANNEL RELEASE message, the actions taken
shall be the same as specified in subclause 4.4.13 \"RR connection
release\".

### 8.5.2 Mobility management

No exceptional cases are described for mobility management messages.

### 8.5.3 Call control

See GSM 04.08 subclause 8.5.3.

8.6 Unknown and unforeseen IEs in the non-imperative message part
-----------------------------------------------------------------

### 8.6.1 IEIs unknown in the message

The CTS‑MS shall ignore all IEs unknown in a message which are not
encoded as \"comprehension required\".

The CTS‑FP shall take the same approach.

### 8.6.2 Out of sequence IEs

The CTS‑MS shall ignore all out of sequence IEs in a message which are
not encoded as \"comprehension required\".

The CTS-FP should take the same approach.

### 8.6.3 Repeated IEs

If an information element with format T, TV, or TLV is repeated in a
message in which repetition of the information element is not specified
in clause 9 of the present document, only the contents of the
information element appearing first shall be handled and all subsequent
repetitions of the information element shall be ignored. When repetition
of information elements is specified, only the contents of specified
repeated information elements shall be handled. If the limit on
repetition of information elements is exceeded, the contents of
information elements appearing first up to the limit of repetitions
shall be handled and all subsequent repetitions of the information
element shall be ignored.

The CTS‑FP should follow the same procedures.

8.7 Non-imperative message part errors
--------------------------------------

This category includes:

\- syntactically incorrect optional IEs;

\- conditional IE errors.

### 8.7.1 Syntactically incorrect optional IEs

The CTS‑MS shall treat all optional IEs that are syntactically incorrect
in a message as not present in the message.

The CTS‑FP shall take the same approach.

### 8.7.2 Conditional IE errors

When the CTS‑MS upon receipt of a message diagnoses a \"missing
conditional IE\" error or an \"unexpected conditional IE\" error or when
it receives a message containing at least one syntactically incorrect
conditional IE, it shall ignore the message except for the fact that, if
an RR connection exists, it shall return a status message (STATUS, CTS
RR STATUS, or MM STATUS depending on the PD and SPD) with cause value
\# 100 \"conditional IE error\".

When the CTS‑FP receives a message and diagnose a \"missing conditional
IE\" error or an \"unexpected conditional IE\" error or when it receives
a message containing at least one syntactically incorrect conditional
IE, the CTS‑FP shall either:

\- try to treat the message (the exact further actions are
implementation dependent); or

\- ignore the message except that it should return a status message
(STATUS, CTS RR STATUS or MM STATUS depending on the protocol
discriminator and sub-protocol discriminator) with cause \# 100
\"conditional IE error\".

8.8 Messages with semantically incorrect contents
-------------------------------------------------

When a message with semantically incorrect contents is received, the
foreseen reactions of the procedural part of GSM 04.56 (i.e. of clauses
5, 5, 6) are performed. If however no such reactions are specified, the
CTS‑MS shall ignore the message except for the fact that, if an RR
connection exists, it returns a status message (STATUS, CTS RR STATUS,
or MM STATUS depending on the PD and SPD) with cause value \# 95
\"semantically incorrect message\".

The CTS‑FP should follow the same procedure except that a status message
is not normally transmitted.

Semantic checking of the Facility information element value part
(defined in GSM 04.80) is the subject of the technical specifications
GSM 04.10 and the GSM 04.8x series.

9 Message functional definitions and contents
=============================================

This subclause defines the structure of the messages of those layer 3
protocols defined in GSM 04.56. These are standard L3 messages as
defined in GSM 04.07 with the exception of those sent on the SCH, ARCH.

Each definition given in the present subclause includes:

a\) a brief description of the message direction and use, including
whether the message has:

1\. Local significance, i.e. relevant only on the originating or
terminating access;

2\. Access significance, i.e. relevant in the originating and
terminating access, but not in the CTS‑FP;

3\. Dual significance, i.e. relevant in either the originating or
terminating access and in the network; or

4\. Global significance, i.e. relevant in the originating and
terminating access and in the network.

b\) a table listing the information elements known in the message and
their order of their appearance in the message. All information elements
that may be repeated are explicitly indicated. (V and LV formatted IEs,
which compose the imperative part of the message, occur before T, TV,
and TLV formatted IEs which compose the non-imperative part of the
message, see GSM 04.07.) In a (maximal) sequence of consecutive
information elements with half octet length, the first information
element with half octet length occupies bits 1 to 4 of octet N, the
second bits 5 to 8 of octet N, the third bits 1 to 4 of octet N+1 etc.
Such a sequence always has an even number of elements.

For each information element the table indicates:

1\. the information element identifier, in hexadecimal notation, if the
IE has format T, TV, or TLV. Usually, there is a default IEI for an
information element type; default IEIs of different IE types of the same
protocol are different. If the IEI has half octet length, it is
specified by a notation representing the IEI as a hexadecimal digit
followed by a \"-\" (example: B-).

NOTE: The same IEI may be used for different information element types
in different messages of the same protocol.

2\. the name of the information element (which may give an idea of the
semantics of the element). The name of the information element (usually
written in italics) followed by \"IE\" or \"information element\" is
used in GSM 04.08 as reference to the information element within a
message.

3\. the name of the type of the information element (which indicates the
coding of the value part of the IE), and generally, the referenced
subclause of clause 10 of GSM 04.08 describing the value part of the
information element.

4\. the presence requirement indication (M, C, or O) for the IE as
defined in GSM 04.07.

5\. The format of the information element (T, V, TV, LV, TLV) as defined
in GSM 04.07.

6\. The length of the information element (or permissible range of
lengths), in octets, in the message, where \"?\" means that the maximum
length of the IE is only constrained by link layer protocol, and in the
case of the Facility IE by possible further conditions specified in
GSM 04.10. This indication is non-normative.

c\) subclauses specifying, where appropriate, conditions for IEs with
presence requirement C or O in the relevant message which together with
other conditions specified in GSM 04.08 define when the information
elements shall be included or not, what non-presence of such IEs means,
and - for IEs with presence requirement C - the static conditions for
presence and/or non-presence of the IEs (see GSM 04.07).
