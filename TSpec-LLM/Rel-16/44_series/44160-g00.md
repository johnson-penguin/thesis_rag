=======

1.1 General
-----------

The present document specifies procedures for the following layers of
the radio interface (*Um* reference point), the interface between the
GSM/EDGE Radio Access Network (GERAN) and the Mobile Station (MS) in
GERAN *Iu mode*:

\- Radio Link Control (RLC).

\- Medium Access Control (MAC), including Physical Link Control
functions.

1.2 Related documents
---------------------

The following documents provide information related to the present
document:

\- 3GPPÂ TSÂ 43.051 is an overall description of the GSM/EDGE Radio Access
Network (GERAN) in *Iu mode*.

\- 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.003 specifies channel types, access capabilities and
channel configurations at the *Um* reference point.

\- 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.004 specifies services offered by the physical layer of
the *Um* reference point. It also specifies control channels. RLC and
MAC use these services and control channels.

\- 3GPPÂ TSÂ 24.007 specifies, in general terms, this protocol\'s
structured functions, its procedures and its relationship with other
layers and entities. It also specifies the basic message format and
error handling applied by layer 3 protocols.

\- 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.118 specifies the RRC procedures when operating in *Iu
mode*.

\- 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.060 specifies RLC/MAC procedures specific to *A/Gb mode*
as well as the procedures that are common to both *A/Gb mode* and *Iu
mode*. It also specifies the messages and Information Elements for both
modes.

\- 3GPPÂ TSÂ 51.010 specifies test procedures for radio-interface
signalling.

1.3 Use of logical control channels
-----------------------------------

3GPPÂ TSÂ 45.002 defines the following logical control channels:

\- Broadcast Control Channel (BCCH): downlink only, used to broadcast
Cell specific information.

\- Packet Broadcast Control Channel (PBCCH): downlink only, used to
broadcast Cell specific information.

\- Packet Paging Channel (PPCH): downlink only, used to send page
requests to Mobile Stations (MSs).

\- Packet Random Access Channel (PRACH): uplink only, used to request
GPRS resources.

\- Packet Access Grant Channel (PAGCH): downlink only, used to allocate
GPRS resources.

\- Packet Associated Control Channel (PACCH): bi-directional, associated
with a Temporary Block Flow (TBF).

\- Packet Timing advance control channel uplink (PTCCH/U): used to
transmit random access bursts to allow estimation of the timing advance
for one MS in transfer state.

\- Packet Timing advance control channel downlink (PTCCH/D): used to
transmit timing advance updates for several MS. One PTCCH/D is paired
with several PTCCH/U\'s.

1.4 Use of logical traffic channels
-----------------------------------

3GPPÂ TSÂ 45.002 defines the following logical traffic channels used by
RLC and MAC:

\- Traffic Channel (TCH): bidirectional, carries encoded speech or user
data using GMSK on a dedicated basic physical subchannel (DBPSCH). TCH
can be full-rate (TCH/F) or half-rate (TCH/H).

\- Octal Traffic Channel (O-TCH): bidirectional, carries encoded speech
using 8-PSK on a DBPSCH. O-TCH can be full-rate (OâTCH/F) or half-rate
(O-TCH/H).

\- Enhanced Traffic Channel (E-TCH): bidirectional, carries user data
using 8-PSK on a DBPSCH.

\- Packet Data Traffic Channel (PDTCH): downlink or uplink, carries user
data using GMSK or 8-PSK on a shared basic physical subchannel (SBPSCH)
or a DBPSCH. PDTCHs can be full-rate (PDTCH/F) or half-rate (PDTCH/H).

1.4a Use of transport channels
------------------------------

For the flexible layer one (FLO) 3GPPÂ TSÂ 45.002 defines the following
transport channel type:

\- Dedicated Channel (DCH): carries user or control data using GMSK or
8-PSK on a DBPSCH. A mobile station may have one or more transport
channels of type DCH active at the same time in each direction.

In the present document, the following notations are used:

\- UDCH: refers to a transport channel of type DCH used exclusively for
carrying RLC/MAC blocks for data transfer belonging to user-plane;

\- CDCH: refers to a transport channel of type DCH used exclusively for
carrying RLC/MAC blocks for data transfer belonging to control-plane.
The signalling TFC (see 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.118) shall be used when CDCH is
active;

\- ADCH: refers to a transport channel of type DCH used exclusively for
carrying RLC/MAC blocks for control message transfer. The signalling TFC
(see 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.118) shall be used when ADCH is active.

1.5 Conventions
---------------

Unless explicitly stated otherwise, the following conventions apply:

\- The notations \"further study\", \"FS\" or \"FFS\" indicate the

4.1 Layer services
------------------

The RLC/MAC sublayer provides services for the transfer over the
physical layer between the network and mobile station of upper layer
PDUs for one mobile station when operating on a dedicated basic physical
subchannel, or for one or more mobile stations when operating on a
shared basic physical subchannel.

The RLC function provides the following services to the upper layers:

**- Transparent data transfer:** This service transmits higher layer
PDUs without adding any protocol information.

**- Acknowledged data transfer:** This service transmits higher layer
PDUs and guarantees delivery to the peer entity.

**- Unacknowledged data transfer:** This service transmits higher layer
PDUs without guaranteeing delivery to the peer entity.

**- Notification of unrecoverable errors:** RLC notifies the upper layer
of errors that cannot be resolved by RLC itself by normal exception
handling procedures.

**- Notification of discard:** RLC notifies the upper layer of the
higher layer PDUs (RLC SDUs) it discards.

\- **Suspend:** The RLC entity does not transmit any new RLC PDUs to the
lower layer.

\- **Resume:** The RLC entity resumes data transmission.

\- **Stop:** The RLC entity does not transmit any RLC PDUs to the lower
layer and does not receive any PDUs from the lower layer.

\- **Continue:** The RLC entity resumes data transmission and reception.

\- **Re-establishment:** The RLC entity is re-established.

The MAC function provides the following service to the upper layer:

\- **Data transfer.**

  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------- ------------------------- ----------------------

### 4.2.2 MAC layer function

The functions of the MAC layer include:

**- Configuring the mapping between logical channels and basic physical
subchannels:** The MAC layer is responsible for configuring the mapping
of logical channel(s) onto the appropriate basic physical subchannel(s).

**- Mapping between TBFs and transport channels.** When FLO is used, the
MAC layer is responsible for mapping TBF(s) onto the appropriate
transport channel(s).

**- Selecting logical channels to be used for each signalling radio
bearer service:** The MAC layer is responsible for mapping SRBs onto
logical channels. There are a set of rules defined for this mapping (see
sub-clause 5.6) which shall be used in the uplink and should be used in
the downlink. The mapping is dependent on the SRB to be sent, the MAC
state, and the logical channels available. The SFACCH may be selected in
preference to the PDTCH if a TBF is not already established for the SRB.
In the downlink there is an additional requirement that the PHYSICAL
INFORMATION message is always sent on the FACCH.

\- **Selecting transport channel to be used for signalling radio bearer
service:** When FLO is used, the MAC layer is responsible for mapping
some SRBs onto transport channels. There is a set of rules defined for
this mapping (see sub-clause 5.6) which shall be used in the uplink and
should be used in the downlink. The mapping is dependent on the SRB to
be sent, the MAC state, and the logical channels and transport channels
available. When SRB data is sent using FLO on a DBPSCH/F, the signalling
TFC shall be used. When SRB data is sent using FLO on a DBPSCH/H, the
MAC layer shall send every RLC/MAC block for data transfer twice in a
row. The corresponding first and second transport blocks shall use the
signalling TFC.

**- Selecting logical channels to be used for each user radio bearer
service:** The logical channels used by the MAC for user radio bearers
are set up by configuration from RRC.

\- **Selecting transport channels to be used for each user radio bearer
service:** When FLO is used, the transport channels used by the MAC for
user radio bearers are set up by configuration from RRC.

\- **Selection of the appropriate transport format per transport
channel.** When FLO is used, the MAC layer is responsible for selecting
the appropriate transport format for each transport channel within the
transport format set configured by RRC for each transport channel so
that the resulting transport format combination belongs to the transport
format combination set configured by RRC.

**- Assignment, reconfiguration and release of shared radio resources
for a TBF:** The MAC layer may handle the assignment of radio resources
needed for a TBF including needs from both the control and user plane.
The MAC layer may reconfigure radio resources of a TBF.

**- MS measurement reporting and control of the reporting:** The MAC
layer is responsible for sending information that control the MS
measurement reporting when using PBCCH or PACCH channels. The MAC layer
also performs the reporting of the measurements from the MS to the
network using PACCH.

**- Broadcasting/listening of/to PBCCH and PCCCH:** The MAC layer
broadcasts/listens (to) the PBCCH of the serving cell for the
sending/decoding of packet system information messages. The MAC layer
also sends paging information on the PCCCH or and monitors the paging
occasions according to the DRX cycle. Within the Mobile Station, the MAC
layer notifies the RRC layer when receiving a paging message; within the
network, it is responsible for aggregating and sending paging messages
addressed to one or more Mobile Stations when received from the RRC
layer.

**- Timing advance control:** The MAC layer controls the operation of
timing advance on shared basic physical subchannels.

**- Ciphering and deciphering** (only in combination with transparent
RLC mode).

**- Priority handling between data flows of one MS. When FLO is used,
the MAC layer is responsible for prioritization between data flows of
one MS on DBPSCH.**

When the MAC layer is providing services to a non-transparent RLC mode
entity, the MAC layer supports the following additional functions:

**- Ciphering.**

**- Identification of different traffic flows of one or more MSs on the
basic physical subchannels:** Inband identification is needed to address
a flow to an MS in the downlink or identify a flow from an MS in the
uplink.

**- Multiplexing/demultiplexing** **of higher layer PDUs:** This may
include priority handling between data flows of one or more mobile
stations, e.g. by attributes of Radio Bearer services.

**- Multiplexing/demultiplexing user and control plane data to/from the
physical layer for PDTCHs:** The MAC layer is responsible for
multiplexing/demultiplexing RLC data blocks carried on PDTCH and RLC/MAC
control blocks carried on PACCH.

**- Scheduling of RLC/MAC data and control PDUs delivered to the
physical layer on shared basic physical subchannels:** This includes USF
and RRBP field monitoring for uplink transfer and sharing radio
resources on the downlink.

**- Splitting/recombining:** This includes splitting/recombining of the
RLC/MAC PDU flow belonging to one or more TBF(s) onto/from several
shared logical channels. This function does not apply for RLC/MAC
control blocks.

4.4 Services required from lower layers
---------------------------------------

The RLC/MAC function uses the services provided by the physical link
layer as defined in 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.004.

The following services are required of the physical layer:

**- Access capabilities: In configurations where FLO is not used,** the
physical layer offers logical channels and the transmission services
associated to higher layers. Logical channels are multiplexed either in
a fixed predefined manner (multiframe structure) or dynamically by the
MAC layer on basic physical subchannels. In configurations where FLO is
used, the physical layer offers transport channels and the transmission
services associated to higher layers. Transport channels are multiplexed
in a dynamic manner on dedicated basic physical subchannels. Basic
physical subchannels are the units scheduled on the radio medium. Some
are reserved by the network for common use (e.g. for use by a
combination of CCCH and BCCH), others are assigned to dedicated
connections with MSs (dedicated basic physical subchannels), or are
assigned to a shared usage between MSs (shared basic physical
subchannels).

**- Error detection:** The physical layer offers an error protected
transmission service, it includes error detection functions and to a
lower level, error correction functions. Erroneous received frames may
be notified to upper layers and, depending on the need of the upper
layer, offered to it. The probability of one or more errors in a
physical block transferred by the physical layer is defined in
3GPPÂ TSÂ 45.005. Due to non-specified methods of quality detection, the
probability of residual errors in transferred blocks may vary between
implementations.

> **- Measurement of the signal strength of neighbouring base
> stations**. Measurements are transferred to RRC.

**- Measurement of the signal quality of the basic physical subchannel
used**. Measurements are transferred to the MAC layer for reporting to
the base station.

**- Cell/PLMN selection in MAC-Idle state**. In MAC-Idle state the
physical layer selects the best cell with its BCCH in close coâoperation
with layerÂ 3, meeting requirements for PLMN selection specified in
3GPPÂ TSÂ 42.011.

5 Introduction to the Medium Access Control (MAC) procedures
============================================================

5.1 General
-----------

The Medium Access Control procedures include the functions related to
the management of the shared transmission resources (e.g. the packet
data physical channels and the radio link connections on packet data
physical channels) and dedicated transmission resources (e.g. the
multiplexing of logical channels onto DBPSCHs).

The Medium Access Control procedures support the provision of Temporary
Block Flows that allow the point-to-point transfer of signalling and
user data within a cell between the network and a mobile station.

Moreover, the Medium Access Control procedures include the procedures
for reception of PBCCH and PCCCH, which permits autonomous cell
reselection performed by the mobile station (see 3GPPÂ TSÂ 45.008).

5.2 Multiplexing principles
---------------------------

### 5.2.1 Temporary Block Flow

A TBF is a logical connection used by two MAC entities to support the
unidirectional transfer of upper-layer PDUs on basic physical
sub-channels. A mobile station shall support eight TBFs in each
direction (uplink and downlink) . The network shall not assign more than
eight TBFs to a mobile station. The total amount of TBFs assigned to a
mobile station in a given direction shall always be lower than or equal
to eight.

The TBF is allocated radio resources on one or more BPSCHs of the same
type (i.e. either SBPSCH(s) or DBPSCH(s)) and may only be mapped on one
logical channel type at a time. A TBF shall not be mapped on more than
one DBPSCH/S. The TBF comprises a number of RLC/MAC blocks carrying one
or more upper-layer PDUs.

A TBF mapped on PDTCH(s) may operate in either GPRS TBF mode or EGPRS
TBF mode. If this TBF is operating on SBPSCH(s), the network sets the
TBF mode in the PACKETÂ UPLINKÂ ASSIGNMENT message, MULTIPE TBF UPLINK
ASSIGNMENT message, PACKETÂ DOWNLINKÂ ASSIGNMENT message, MUTLIPLE TBF
DOWNLINK ASSIGNMENT message, PACKET TIMESLOT RECONFIGURE message,
MULTIPLE TBF TIMESLOT RECONFIGURE message. If this TBF is operating on
DBPSCH(s), the network sets the TBF mode using RRC procedures (see
3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.118). The EGPRS TBF mode is only supported by EGPRS capable
MSs.

A TBF mapped on FACCH, SACCH or SDCCH operates implicitly in DCCH TBF
mode.

A TBF mapped on TCH operates implicitly in TCH TBF mode.

A TBF mapped on UDCH(s) operates in UDCH TBF mode. UDCH TBF mode is
applicable only when FLO is used.

A TBF mapped on CDCH(s) operates in CDCH TBF mode. CDCH TBF mode is
applicable only when FLO is used.

A TBF associated with a URB may operate in either GPRS TBF mode, EGPRS
TBF mode, DCCH TBF mode, TCH TBF mode or UDCH TBF mode.

A TBF associated with a SRB may operate in either GPRS TBF mode (CS-1
coding only), DCCH TBF mode or CDCH TBF mode. It shall not operate in
EGPRS TBF mode.

### 5.2.2 Temporary Flow Identity

#### 5.2.2.1 Temporary Flow Identity for SBPSCH

See 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.060 sub-clause 5.2.2.

Global\_TFI is used in an uplink or a downlink RLC/MAC control message
to unambiguously identify the mobile station or one of its TBFs on
SBPSCH. If present, the Global TFI addresses the mobile station using
either an uplink TFI or a downlink TFI. The TFI used shall obey the
rules below:

\- If the TFI is used to identify the mobile station, any TFI may be
used provided:

\- The timeslot number (TN) of the SBPSCH on which the RLC/MAC control
message is sent corresponds to a timeslot assigned to the TBF in the
direction of the TBF.

\- If the TFI is used to identify a TBF, the TFI of this TBF shall be
used. Additionally if the RLC/MAC control message is sent in uplink, and
the TBF is a downlink TBF:

\- If the timeslot number (TN) of the SBPSCH on which the RLC/MAC
control message is sent is different from the TN of each of the
timeslots assigned to the TBF in the direction of the TBF, the TN of the
TBF shall be included in the RLC/MAC control message to uniquely
identify this TBF.

#### 5.2.2.2 Temporary Flow Identity for DBPSCH

A TBF mapped on DBPSCH(s) may operate in either GPRS, EGPRS, DCCH, TCH,
CDCH or UDCH TBF mode. A TBF mapped on DBPSCH/S shall operate in DCCH
TBF mode.

A TBF in either GPRS TBF mode, EGPRS TBF mode or UDCH TBF mode (NT-RLC)
is implicitly assigned a TFI that equals the identity (RBid) of the
radio bearer it carries. An RLC/MAC block associated with such TBF shall
contain a TFI. The TBF to which a RLC data block belongs is identified
by the TFI and the direction (uplink or downlink) in which this RLC data
block is sent. The TBF to which a RLC/MAC control message belongs is
identified by the TFI, the direction in which this RLC/MAC control
message is sent and the message type.

A TBF in TCH TBF mode is not assigned a TFI. This TBF is in its
direction the only user of the TCH on which it is mapped, as described
in sub-clause 9.2.2.

A TBF in UDCH TBF mode running in T-RLC is not assigned a TFI.

A TBF in DCCH TBF mode is implicitly assigned a Reduced Radio Bearer
identity (RRBid) that provides a one-to-one mapping with the RBid of the
radio bearer it carries. In case this radio bearer is a User-plane Radio
Bearer (URB), the mapping between RRBid and RBid is given at radio
bearer set-up of this URB by means of primitive exchange between RRC and
MAC (CMAC-CONFIG). An RLC/MAC block associated with a DCCH TBF mode
shall contain a RRBid. The TBF to which a RLC data block belongs is
identified by the RRBid and the direction (uplink or downlink) in which
this RLC data block is sent. The TBF to which a RLC/MAC control message
belongs is identified by the RRBid, the direction in which this RLC/MAC
control message is sent and the message type.

A TBF in CDCH TBF mode is implicitly assigned a Reduced Radio Bearer
identity (RRBid) that provides a one-to-one mapping with the RBid of the
signalling radio bearer it carries. An RLC/MAC block associated with a
CDCH TBF mode shall contain a RRBid. The TBF to which a RLC data block
belongs is identified by the RRBid and the direction (uplink or
downlink) in which this RLC data block is sent. The TBF to which a
RLC/MAC control message belongs is identified by the TFI or RRBid, the
direction in which this RLC/MAC control message is sent and the message
type.

### 5.2.3 Uplink State Flag

See 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.060 sub-clause 5.2.3.

### 5.2.4 Medium Access modes

#### 5.2.4.1 Medium Access modes for SBPSCH

See 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.060 sub-clause 5.2.4.

#### 5.2.4.2 Medium Access modes for DBPSCH

The dedicated allocation is applicable exclusively on a dedicated
channel (i.e. mapped onto a DBPSCH). No other MAC mode may apply on
DBPSCH. If the mobile station is assigned a DBPSCH (e.g. PACKET DBPSCH
ASSIGNMENT), dedicated allocation shall be used in both uplink and
downlink directions on this DBPSCH.

### 5.2.5 Multiplexing of GPRS and EGPRS TBF mode capable mobile stations

See 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.060 sub-clause 5.2.4a.

5.3 MAC States
--------------

### 5.3.1 MAC-Idle state

#### 5.3.1.1 General

In MAC-Idle state no TBF exists and the mobile station monitors relevant
paging subchannels on the PCCCH. The mobile station may use DRX for
monitoring the PCCCH.

#### 5.3.1.2 Establishment of a SBPSCH

In MAC-Idle state, upper layers may require the transfer of an
upper-layer PDU, which may trigger the establishment of a TBF on
SBPSCH(s) and the transition to MAC-Shared state.

#### 5.3.1.3 Establishment of a DBPSCH

In MAC-Idle state upper layers may require the transfer of an
upper-layer PDU, which may trigger the establishment of a TBF on
DBPSCH(s) either through RRC procedures (see 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.118) or RLC/MAC
procedures, in which case the mobile station leaves MAC-Idle state and
enters the MAC-Dedicated state immediately after assignment of the
DBPSCH(s). A mobile station shall not be assigned more than one
DBPSCH/S.

### 5.3.2 MAC-Shared state

#### 5.3.2.1 General

In MAC-Shared state, the mobile station is allocated radio resources
providing a TBF for a point-to-point connection on one or more SBPSCHs.
The TBF is used for the unidirectional transfer of upper-layer PDUs
between the network and the mobile station. In MAC-Shared state the
following services are offered:

\- transfer of upper-layer PDUs in RLC acknowledged mode;

\- transfer of upper-layer PDUs in RLC unacknowledged mode.

#### 5.3.2.2 Release of all SBPSCHs

In MAC-Shared state, when all TBFs have been released in the downlink
and uplink direction, the mobile station returns to MAC-Idle state.

#### 5.3.2.3 Establishment of a DBPSCH

In MAC-Shared state upper layers may require the transfer of an
upper-layer PDU, which may trigger the establishment of a TBF on a
DBPSCH through RRC procedures (see 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.118), in which case the
mobile station leaves MACâShared state and enters the MAC-DTM state.

#### 5.3.2.4 Radio bearer reconfiguration

Upon reconfiguration of all Radio Bearers from SBPSCH(s) to DBPSCH(s),
the mobile station shall leave the MACâShared state and enter the
MAC-Dedicated state after release of all TBFs on SBPSCH(s) and set-up of
the first DBPSCH. See 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.118.

### 5.3.3 MAC-DTM state

#### 5.3.3.1 General

In MAC-DTM state a mobile station has been allocated radio resources
providing one or more DBPSCHs and one or more SBPSCHs. A mobile station
shall not be allocated radio resources providing a DBPSCH/S with any
other BPSCH(s). The allocation of radio resources is co-ordinated by the
network, in agreement with the capabilities of the mobile station.

The transfer of upper-layer PDUs in RLC acknowledged, RLC unacknowledged
mode or RLC transparent mode is provided.

#### 5.3.3.2 Release of all SBPSCHs

In MAC-DTM state, when all TBFs on SBPSCHs have been released, in
downlink and uplink directions, the mobile station enters MAC-Dedicated
state.

#### 5.3.3.3 Release of all DBPSCHs

In MAC-DTM state, upon release of all DBPSCHs, the mobile station enters
the MAC-Shared state.

#### 5.3.3.4 Release of all SBPSCHs and DBPSCHs

In MAC-DTM state, upon release of all SBPSCHs and DBPSCHs, the mobile
station enters the MAC-Idle state.

### 5.3.4 MAC-Dedicated state

#### 5.3.4.1 General

In MAC-Dedicated state a mobile station has been allocated radio
resources providing one or more DBPSCHs. A mobile station shall not be
allocated more than one DBPSCH/S. The allocation of radio resources is
co-ordinated by the network, in agreement with the capabilities of the
mobile station.

The transfer of upper-layer PDUs in RLC acknowledged, RLC unacknowledged
mode or RLC transparent mode is provided.

#### 5.3.4.2 Release of all DBPSCHs

In MAC-Dedicated state, upon release of all DBPSCHs, the mobile station
shall enter the MAC-Idle state.

#### 5.3.4.3 Radio bearer reconfiguration

Upon reconfiguration of all Radio Bearers from DBPSCH(s) to SBPSCH(s),
the mobile station shall leave the MACâDedicated state and enter the
MAC-Shared state after release of all DBPSCH(s) and set-up of the first
TBF on SBPSCH(s) (see 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.118).

5.4 General MAC procedures in MAC-Idle state and MAC-Shared state
-----------------------------------------------------------------

### 5.4.1 Mobile station side

#### 5.4.1.1 General

A mobile station in MAC-Idle state or MAC-Shared state shall monitor the
system information broadcast in the cell.

In MAC-Idle state, the mobile station shall monitor the radio blocks on
PCCCH as defined in sub-clauses 5.4.1.8 and 5.4.1.9. The determination
of the paging group for the mobile station is defined in 3GPPÂ TSÂ 45.002.

#### 5.4.1.2 Cell reselection

Cell reselection in MAC-Idle state and MAC-Shared state is specified in
3GPPÂ TSÂ 45.008. The MAC entity on the mobile station side indicates to
the RRC layer the availability of a cell and a cell change when decided
by the MAC sublayer. RRC is advised of system information broadcast in
the cell when a new cell has been selected or when a relevant part of
this information changes.

If the new cell supports *Iu mode* the mobile station shall operate in
*Iu mode* unless ordered to operate in *A/Gb mode* by the network. If
the new cell does not support *Iu mode*, a mobile station which supports
*A/Gb mode* shall operate in *A/Gb mode* as described in 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.060.
If operating in *Iu mode*, the mobile station shall perform packet
access in *Iu mode otherwise the mobile station shall perform packet
access in A/Gb mode*.

When a cell reselection is determined by the mobile station or ordered
by the network, the mobile station may continue its operation in
MAC-Idle state or MAC-Shared state in the old serving cell, while
acquiring certain system information for the target cell.

If the old cell does not support CCN, the operation in the old cell
shall be aborted when one of the following conditions are met:

\- the mobile station starts to receive information on PBCCH in the
target cell;

\- the mobile station has received the SI13 message (see 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.018)
and there is no PBCCH present in the target cell; or

\- the criteria for camping on the old cell are no longer fulfilled (see
3GPPÂ TSÂ 45.008).

If PBCCH is present in the target cell, the mobile station shall delay
the start of receiving information on PBCCH until the first occurrence
of PSI1 in block B0. If the reception of PSI1 or PSI2 messages fails
(see sub-clause 5.4.1.5) the mobile station may re-establish and
continue its operation in the old cell, until the next occurrence of
PSI1 in block B0.

While the operation is maintained in the old cell, the mobile station
may suspend its TBF(s) or suspend the monitoring of radio blocks on
PCCCH, in order to receive necessary information on BCCH in the target
cell. Such suspension may be required in MAC-Idle state and MAC-Shared
state. It is performed without notification to the network.

Suspension of the operation in the old cell for this purpose is allowed
during the time required, for each message and according to the mobile
station\'s multislot class, to receive the required messages on BCCH in
the target cell. The allowable suspension of an uplink TBF may be
extended with one block period, in case of dynamic or extended dynamic
allocation, if the mobile station is unable to receive the corresponding
USF due to the suspension of downlink operation.

When the conditions are fulfilled to switch to the new cell, the mobile
station shall abort any TBF in progress by immediately ceasing to decode
the downlink, ceasing to transmit on the uplink, stopping all RLC/MAC
timers except for timers related to measurement reporting. The mobile
station shall then switch to the identified specified new cell and shall
obey the relevant RLC/MAC procedures on this new cell.

If the old cell supports CCN, a mobile station shall, when the cell
reselection has been determined, follow the procedures for Network
Assisted Cell Change as specified in 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.060 sub-clauses
5.5.1.1a.2 and 8.8.2.

Under no circumstances and independent of whether CCN mode is supported,
operations in the old cell shall be continued more than 5Â seconds after
a cell reselection has been determined.

#### 5.4.1.3 Network Assisted Cell Change

See 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.060 sub-clause 5.5.1.1a.

#### 5.4.1.4 Release of DBPSCHs

##### 5.4.1.4.1 General

The mobile station shall acquire system information broadcast in the
serving cell when in MAC-Idle state, after the release of all DBPSCHs if
the mobile station had been unable to monitor the system information
broadcast on PBCCH while one or more DBPSCHs were allocated:

> \- The acquisition of system information shall be performed according
> to the requirements in sub-clause 5.4.1.5.

\- The mobile station shall not attempt a packet access or accept a
packet downlink assignment before these requirements are fulfilled.

The following exceptions, stated in sub-clauses 5.4.1.4.2 and 5.4.1.4.3,
may apply.

##### 5.4.1.4.2 Continuation of PBCCH information

At the allocation of a DBPSCH, the mobile station may keep the PSI
messages received on PBCCH before the allocation of the DBPSCH. If all
DBPSCHs are released in the same serving cell within 30Â s after the PSI1
message was last received, the mobile station may resume the supervision
of PBCCH\_CHANGE\_MARK and update of PBCCH information, defined in
3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.060 sub-clause 5.5.1.2.1, and need not initiate a *complete
acquisition* of PBCCH information, as specified in sub-clause 5.4.1.5.

##### 5.4.1.4.3 Receipt of PSI14 message in MAC-DTM state

In MAC-DTM state, the mobile station may receive the PSI14 message on
PACCH in the serving cell. If all DBPSCHs are released in the same
serving cell within 30Â s after the PSI14 message was last received, the
mobile station may use the PSI14 message as a substitute for the SI13 or
SI13-Alt message after the release of all DBPSCHs, until either the SI13
or SI13-Alt message has been received or the mobile station starts to
receive information on PBCCH.

The presence of a PBCCH in the cell is indicated by a PBCCH description
in the PSI14 message. If the message does not contain the PBCCH
description, the mobile station shall assume that PBCCH is not present
in the cell.

After the release of all of DBPSCHs, the mobile station shall perform a
*complete acquisition* of PBCCH information, as defined in sub-clause
5.4.1.5.

#### 5.4.1.5 System information on PBCCH

See 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.060 sub-clause 5.5.1.2.

#### 5.4.1.6 System information on BCCH

##### 5.4.1.6.1 General

The support of *Iu mode* shall be indicated in SI3 message sent on BCCH.
In addition, the support of *Iu mode* shall be indicated in either SI4
or SI7 and 8 messages. The SI3, SI4, SI7 and SI8 messages contain the
CBQ3 parameter that indicates if *Iu mode* is supported in the cell
*(see 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.018)*.

If CBQ3 parameter sent on BCCH indicates that *Iu mode* is supported in
the cell then a mobile station shall acquire a PBCCH description from
either SI13 or SI13-Alt and shall operate in *Iu mode (see
3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.118)*.

If CBQ3 indicates that *Iu mode* is not supported in the cell then a
mobile station may operate in *A/Gb mode* as described in
3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.060.

When a new cell has been selected where PBCCH is not present, the mobile
station shall operate as described in 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.060.

##### 5.4.1.6.2 Establishment of PBCCH

The mobile station may receive an SI13, SI13-Alt or PSI13 message
providing a PBCCH description indicating that PBCCH is present in the
cell. The mobile station shall then perform a *complete acquisition* of
PBCCH messages using the indicated PBCCH (see sub-clause 5.4.1.7).

##### 5.4.1.6.3 (void)

#### 5.4.1.7 (void)

#### 5.4.1.8 Discontinuous reception (DRX)

A mobile station in MAC-Idle state may use Discontinuous Reception (DRX)
to reduce its power consumption.

In DRX mode, the MAC layer receives the paging group relevant for the
mobile station from the RRC layer via the CMAC-CONFIG primitive. The
computation of the paging group is defined in 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.118. The mobile
station shall only monitor the blocks corresponding to its paging group.
The GERAN shall initiate paging procedures for this mobile station on
the blocks corresponding to its paging group.

In non-DRX mode, the mobile station shall monitor all paging blocks on
the monitored PCCCH (see 3GPPÂ TSÂ 45.002).

There are three cases when the mobile station enters a non-DRX mode
period:

1\) When entering the MAC-Idle state, the mobile station shall enter the
non-DRX mode period.

> The duration of the non-DRX mode period is determined by the value of
> the DRX\_TIMER\_MAX parameter broadcast in the cell.
>
> If the mobile station receives a new value of the DRX\_TIMER\_MAX
> parameter during the non-DRX mode period, the mobile station may wait
> to apply the new value until the next time the non-DRX mode period is
> entered.

2\) When the network operates in NC2 mode and the MS sends a NC
measurement report, both the MS and the network shall enter the NC2
non-DRX mode period. The duration of this period is defined by the
NC\_NON\_DRX\_PERIOD parameter.

3\) When initiating the MM procedures for GPRS attach and routeing area
update defined in 3GPPÂ TSÂ 24.008, the mobile station shall enter the MM
non-DRX mode period. This period ends when either of the messages GPRS
ATTACH ACCEPT, GPRS ATTACH REJECT, ROUTING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT or ROUTING
AREA UPDATE REJECT is received by the mobile station. This period also
ends after timeout when waiting for any of these messages.

The non-DRX mode periods defined above run independent of each other and
may overlap. In RRC-Idle mode, the mobile station shall be in non-DRX
mode during any of the non-DRX mode periods.

#### 5.4.1.9 Page mode procedures on PCCCH

See 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.060 sub-clause 5.5.1.6.

#### 5.4.1.10 Frequency Parameters

See 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.060 sub-clause 5.5.1.7.

#### 5.4.1.11 G-RNTI Management

G-RNTI is used to identify a mobile station during contention resolution
and is allocated by RRC in the GERAN. If a mobile station does not
possess a GERAN allocated G-RNTI when making a contention access it
shall use a Random G-RNTI. Upon receiving a G-RNTI allocation from the
GERAN a mobile station shall use it for subsequent contention accesses
for as long as it remains valid.

### 5.4.2 Network side

#### 5.4.2.1 System Information broadcasting

##### 5.4.2.1.1 System information on PBCCH

If PBCCH is present in the cell, the network regularly broadcasts PACKET
SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE (PSI) 1, 2, 3, 3bis and PSI16 messages, and
optionally PSI3ter, PSI3quater and some types of PSI messages on the
PBCCH. The PSI 2, PSI 3bis, PSI3 ter, PSI3quater messages and some
further types of PSI messages may be broadcast in multiple number of
instances. Based on the information broadcast in PSI messages, a mobile
station is able to decide whether and how it may gain access to the
system via the current cell.

NOTE: The network should take into account the limitations of earlier
version of mobile equipments to understand the 3-digit MNC format of the
location area identification, see 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.060 sub-clauseÂ 12.23 and
3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.018, table \"Location Area Identification information
element\".

Instances of the PSIÂ 5 message are broadcast on PBCCH if the mobile
stations camping on the cell shall perform measurement reporting (see
3GPPÂ TSÂ 45.008).

Instances of the PSI6 and PSI7 message may be broadcast on the PBCCH if
non-GSM broadcast information is transmitted.

The PSI8 message may be broadcast on the PBCCH if additional information
(i.e. CBCH configuration and dynamic ARFCN mapping) shall be provided to
the mobile station camping on the cell.

The PSI16 message shall be broadcast on the PBCCH to provide mobile
stations with additional information required for *Iu mode* operation.

The PSI1 message contains the PBCCH\_CHANGE\_MARK and PSI\_CHANGE\_FIELD
parameters. The value of the PBCCH\_CHANGE\_MARK may be incremented by
one, moduloÂ 8, each time the network makes a change in the PBCCH
information. Such change includes any addition, removal or replacement
of PSI messages, contents of PSI messages, or change in the scheduling
of PSI messages on PBCCH. A change in the contents of the PSI1 message
alone shall not be reflected in the PBCCH\_CHANGE\_MARK. When the
PBCCH\_CHANGE\_MARK is incremented, the PSI\_CHANGE\_FIELD parameter
shall be set to an appropriate value to indicate the nature of the
latest change in the PBCCH information.

The network may increment the PBCCH\_CHANGE\_MARK value by more than
one, moduloÂ 8, in order to enforce a complete acquisition of PBCCH
information of all mobile stations.

In order to avoid extensive TBF suspensions following an increment of
the PBCCH\_CHANGE\_MARK parameter, the network may send PSI messages on
PACCH to mobile stations in MAC-Shared state.

The network indicates the support of the PACKET PSI STATUS and EGPRS
PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST messages in the PSI1 message.

##### 5.4.2.1.2 System information on BCCH

In addition to the requirements in 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.018, a SYSTEM INFORMATION
TYPE 13 (SI13) message or a SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 13 Alt (SI13-Alt)
message is regularly broadcast by the network on the BCCH to support *Iu
mode*. Note that either the SI13 message or the SI13-Alt message is
required on BCCH to support *Iu mode*.

##### 5.4.2.1.3 System information on PACCH (and other logical channels)

See 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.060 sub-clause 5.5.2.1.3.

##### 5.4.2.1.4 Consistent sets of system information messages

Certain types of PSI messages are sent on PBCCH in a multiple number of
instances. If such a PSI message type is sent on (P)BCCH, a mobile
station shall receive a consistent set of that type of PSI message. In
some cases, more than one type of PSI messages may be joined into one
consistent set, see table 5.4.2.1.4.1.

Table 5.4.2.1.4.1: Consistent sets of system information messages

  ------------------- ------------ --------------------- --------------------- ------------------- -------------------

  ------------------- ------------ --------------------- --------------------- ------------------- -------------------

A consistent set of system information messages is identified by a PSI
*change mark* parameter included in each message in the set. All
messages within a consistent set shall have the same value of this
parameter.

The total number of system information messages of a certain type within
a consistent set is indicated by a PSI *count* parameter included in
each message in the set. The position of a certain message instance
within the consistent set of system information messages is indicated by
a PSI *index* parameter.

The PSI *count* parameter shall have the value N--1, where N is the
number of instances of the particular message type present in the
consistent set. The PSI *index* parameter shall have a range from zero
to N--1. Different instances of a particular message type in a
consistent set shall have different values of the PSI *index* parameter.

See 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.060 sub-clause 5.5.2.2.

#### 5.4.2.3 Network Assisted Cell Change

See 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.060 sub-clause 5.5.2.3.

5.5 Measurement reports
-----------------------

### 5.5.1 General

See 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.060 sub-clause 5.6.0.

### 5.5.2 Network Control (NC) measurement reporting

The behaviour of the mobile station is controlled by the parameter
NETWORK\_CONTROL\_ORDER broadcast in the PSI5 message on PBCCH, in the
SI13, SI13-Alt and SI2quater messages on the BCCH and in the PSI13
message on PACCH. Alternatively, the network may send the
NETWORK\_CONTROL\_ORDER parameters in a PACKET MEASUREMENT ORDER or in a
PACKET CELL CHANGE ORDER message on PCCCH or PACCH to a particular
mobile station. The parameter NETWORK\_CONTROL\_ORDER may have one of
the values NC0, NC1, NC2 or RESET (see 3GPPÂ TSÂ 45.008).

When in mode NC1 or NC2, the mobile station shall perform the NC
measurements as defined in 3GPPÂ TSÂ 45.008. The reporting periods are
indicated in the NC\_REPORTING\_PERIOD\_I and NC\_REPORTING\_PERIOD\_T
field of the PSI5, the SI2quater, the PACKET CELL CHANGE ORDER or the
PACKET MEASUREMENT ORDER message. If NC\_NON\_DRX\_PERIOD,
NC\_REPORTING\_PERIOD\_I or NC\_REPORTING\_PERIOD\_T have not been
received by the mobile station the default values shall be used. The
mobile station shall apply to the timer T3158 either the
NC\_REPORTING\_PERIOD\_I when in MAC-Idle state or the
NC\_REPORTING\_PERIOD\_T when in MAC-Shared state. The measurement
results shall be sent to the network using the procedures specified in
sub-clause 7.4 for MAC Idle state, and in sub-clause 8.4 for MAC-Shared
state.

On expiry of timer T3158, the mobile station shall restart timer T3158
with the indicated reporting period, perform the measurements and send
either the PACKETÂ MEASUREMENTÂ REPORT message or the
PACKETÂ ENHANCEDÂ MEASUREMENTÂ REPORT to the network. The condition for
sending the PACKETÂ ENHANCEDÂ MEASUREMENTÂ REPORT message instead of the
PACKETÂ MEASUREMENTÂ REPORT message is based on the REPORT\_TYPE parameter
and if the MS has received BSIC information for all cells. For the
detailed conditions see 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.060 sub-clause 11.2.23, sub-clause
11.2.4 and sub-clause 11.2.9b and also 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.018 sub-clause
10.5.2.33b.

A mobile station in mode NC1 or NC2 may receive a new indicated
reporting period while timer T3158 is active. If the new indicated
reporting period is less than the time to expiry of timer T3158, the
mobile station shall immediately restart timer T3158 with the new
indicated reporting period. Otherwise, the timer T3158 shall continue to
run.

When changing from MAC-Shared state to MAC-Idle state, a mobile station
in mode NC1 or NC2 shall restart the timer T3158 with the reporting
period determined by the NC\_REPORTING\_PERIOD\_I parameter if at least
one PACKET MEASUREMENT REPORT or PACKET ENHANCED MEASUREMENT REPORT
message was sent in MAC-Shared state. Otherwise the timer T3158 shall
continue to run.

When changing from MAC-Idle state to MAC-Shared state, a mobile station
in mode NC1 or NC2 shall restart the timer T3158 with the reporting
period determined by the NC\_REPORTING\_PERIOD\_T parameter if the
reporting period is less than the time to expiry of timer T3158.
Otherwise the timer T3158 shall continue to run.

When a mobile station in *Iu mode* leaves RRC-Cell Shared state and
enters RRC-GRA\_PCH state or RRC-Idle mode, the timer T3158 shall be
stopped and no more measurement reports shall be sent to the network.

A mobile station may reselect a new cell or may be ordered to reselect a
new cell with mode NC1 or NC2 while timer T3158 is active. If time to
expiry of timer T3158 is greater than the indicated reporting period for
the new cell, the mobile station shall immediately restart timer T3158
with the indicated reporting period for the new cell. Otherwise, the
timer T3158 shall continue to run.

At cell reselection the NC measurement parameters valid for the mobile
station in the new cell (NETWORK\_CONTROL\_ORDER, NC\_NON\_DRX\_PERIOD,
NC\_REPORTING\_PERIOD\_I and NC\_REPORTING\_PERIOD\_T) are either:

\- brought from the old cell (if received in a PACKET MEASUREMENT ORDER
or PACKET CELL CHANGE ORDER message); or

\- received in a broadcast PSI5, SI13, SI13-Alt, PSI13 or SI2quater
message in the new cell. If no parameters have been brought from the old
cell, and until individual measurement parameters are received in the
new cell, the mobile station shall use the broadcast measurement
parameters from PSI5 or use the default parameter values.

The default frequency list to be applied in the new cell shall be the
BA(GPRS) list of that cell until a new PACKET MEASUREMENT ORDER message
is received. The BA(GPRS) list could also have been modified by
frequency parameters received in a PACKET\_CELL\_CHANGE\_ORDER message
in the old cell.

For (NC) measurement reporting, the Mobile Station shall use
PACKETÂ ENHANCEDÂ MEASUREMENTÂ REPORT messages instead of
PACKETÂ MEASUREMENTÂ REPORT messages if that is indicated by the parameter
REPORT\_TYPE and if at least one BSIC is allocated to each frequency in
the BA(GPRS) list.

For a multi-RAT mobile station, reports on 3G cells may also be included
in the reporting. For report with the PACKETÂ MEASUREMENTÂ REPORT message,
reporting is performed on two separate lists: the BA(GPRS) and the 3G
Neighbour Cell List (for a multi-RAT MS). For report with the PACKET
ENHANCED MEASUREMENT REPORT message, reporting is performed on the
Neighbour Cell List (defined in 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.060 sub-clause 5.6.3.3).

A mobile station that has been allocated one or more DBPSCHs, shall not
send Network Control measurement reports to the network during that
period. The mobile station shall return to the previous reporting mode
when all the DBPSCHs have been released.

### 5.5.4 Additional measurement and reporting parameters

See 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.060 sub-clause 5.6.4.

5.6 Mapping of Signalling Radio Bearers (SRB) onto logical channels / transport channels
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 5.6.1 Downlink

In downlink direction, the mapping of SRBs onto logical channels or, in
case of FLO, transport channels is left up to network implementation.
The rules defined in sub-clause 5.6.2 should be used. The MS shall be
able to receive SRB data on any of the following logical channels if
available: SDCCH, SACCH, FACCH, PDTCH and SFACCH. Additionaly, a MS
supporting FLO shall be able to receive SRB data on CDCH.

### 5.6.2 Uplink

#### 5.6.2.1 MAC-Dedicated State

Table 5.6.2.1.1 represents the alternatives for mapping a given SRB onto
a given logical channel or, in case of FLO, transport channel when the
MS is in MACâDedicated state. The MS shall obey the rules given in this
table. Only the logical channels or transport channels available for
SRBs are listed.

In case more than one DBPSCHs are assigned, with a mixed allocation of
TCH(s) and PDTCH(s) (e.g. TCH on one DBPSCH, and PDTCH on the other
DBPSCH), any ongoing transfer of a given SRB shall continue in the same
TBF mode.

5.7 Multiplexing principles with Flexible Layer One
---------------------------------------------------

### 5.7.1 General

The Flexible Layer One may only be used on DBPSCH in MAC-Dedicated and
MAC-DTM states. The allowed channel combinations are defined in
3GPPÂ TSÂ 45.002.

Multiplexing of TBFs in UDCH TBF mode or CDCH TBF mode with TBFs in GPRS
TBF mode, EGPRS TBF mode, TCH TBF mode or DCCH TBF mode on the same
DBPSCH is not allowed with the exceptions of TBFs on SACCH and half-rate
configurations.

A mobile station may have up to four simultaneous active transport
channels in the same TTI on a DBPSCH (see 3GPPÂ TSÂ 45.002)

### 5.7.2 Mutliplexing between user-plane and control-plane

The figure below illustrates the multiplexing between user-plane and
control-plane onto transport channels.

A TBF may send data onto one transport channel at a time per TTI per
DBPSCH, following the rules below:

\- RLC/MAC blocks for data transfer associated with an SRB shall be sent
on CDCH.

\- RLC/MAC blocks for data transfer associated with a URB shall be sent
on UDCH.

\- RLC/MAC blocks for control message transfer shall be sent on ADCH.

There may be up to four simultaneous UDCHs active during the same TTI on
a DBPSCH, allowing for transfer of data from four different TBFs during
the same TTI.

On a DBPSCH, when either CDCH or ADCH is active during a TTI, no other
transport channel may be active at the same time.

NOTE: User-plane and control-plane data are effectively multiplexed on
the same DBPSCH on a TTI-basis.

6 Paging procedures
===================

6.1 General
-----------

The Packet Paging procedure is always initiated upon request by RRC. RRC
shall provide all the necessary information to construct a PACKET PAGING
REQUEST message. The MAC layer shall include in the PACKET PAGING
REQUEST message all information received from the RRC layer. A number of
mobile stations can be paged in the same paging message.

On receipt of a PACKET PAGING REQUEST message, the MAC shall forward all
received information for this mobile station to RRC.

6.2 Paging initiation in MAC-Idle state
---------------------------------------

In MAC-Idle state and upon request from RRC, the MAC layer initiates the
Packet Paging procedure by transmitting a PACKET PAGING REQUEST message
on an appropriate paging subchannel on the PCCCH, taking into account
the DRX parameters valid for each targeted mobile station (see
sub-clause 5.4.1.8).

The following IEs shall be included in the in the PACKET PAGING REQUEST
message. RRC determines the values of the IEs (see 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.118).

\- MS Identity (IMSI, TMSI, P-TMSI or G-RNTI).

The following IEs may be included in the in the PACKET PAGING REQUEST
message. RRC determines which IEs to include and their values (see
3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.118).

\- CN domain identity.

\- Paging cause.

\- Paging Record Type Identifier.

6.3 Paging initiation in MAC-Shared state
-----------------------------------------

In MAC-Shared state and upon request from RRC, the MAC layer initiates
the paging procedure by transmitting a PACKET PAGING REQUEST message on
the PACCH.

The following IEs shall be included in the in the PACKET PAGING REQUEST
message. RRC determines the values of the IEs (see 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.118).

\- MS Identity (IMSI, TMSI, P-TMSI or G-RNTI).

The following IEs may be included in the in the PACKET PAGING REQUEST
message. RRC determines which IEs to include and their values (see
3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.118).

\- CN domain identity.

\- Paging cause.

\- Paging Record Type Identifier.

6.4 Reception of PACKET PAGING REQUEST by an MS
-----------------------------------------------

Upon reception of a PACKET PAGING REQUEST message on either PCCCH or
PACCH, the MAC shall forward all received information for this mobile
station to RRC.

7 Medium Access Control (MAC) procedures on PCCCH
=================================================

7.1 General
-----------

The establishment of a Temporary Block Flow (TBF) can be initiated by
either the mobile station or the network.

The request for establishment of a TBF using the PCCCH is described in
this sub-clause. For mobile stations in MAC-Idle state measurement
reports messages are sent on temporary fixed allocations without the
establishment of an uplink TBF (see sub-clause 7.4).

7.2 TBF establishment initiated by the mobile station on PCCCH
--------------------------------------------------------------

### 7.2.1 General

The purpose of the packet access procedure is to establish a TBF to
support the transfer of upper-layer PDUs in the direction from the
mobile station to the network. Packet access shall be done on PCCCH, as
defined in this sub-clause. The packet access can be done in either one
phase (sub-clause 7.2.3) or in two phases (sub-clauses 7.2.3 and 7.2.4).

TBF establishment can also be done on PACCH if a TBF for transfer of
upper-layer PDUs in the direction from the network to the mobile station
is already established (see sub-clause 8.2.2.1.3). TBF establishment can
also be done on PACCH if the mobile station is releasing its last TBF
for transfer of upper-layer PDUs in the direction from the mobile
station to the network and TBF for transfer of upper-layer PDUs in the
direction from the network to the mobile station is not established (see
sub-clause 10.4.5.5 and sub-clause 10.4.6.4).

If the mobile station is in MAC-Dedicated state the establishment of a
TBF shall be performed by the procedures specified in 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.118.

The packet access procedure is initiated by the mobile station.
Initiation is triggered by a request from upper layers to transfer an
upper-layer PDU using the primitives that are defined in sub-clause 4.3.

Upon such a request:

\- if access to the network is allowed (sub-clause 7.2.2), the mobile
station shall initiate the packet access procedure as defined in
sub-clause 7.2.3.1.1;

\- otherwise, the MAC sublayer in the mobile station shall reject the
request.

### 7.2.2 Permission to access the network

See 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.060 sub-clause 7.1.1.

### 7.2.3 Initiation of a TBF establishment

#### 7.2.3.1 Initiation of the packet access procedure

##### 7.2.3.1.1 General

The mobile station shall initiate the packet access procedure by
scheduling the sending of (EGPRS) PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST messages on the
PRACH corresponding to its PCCCH\_GROUP. The mobile station shall use
the last access parameters received on PBCCH. At sending of the first
(EGPRS) PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST message, the mobile station shall store
the value for the Retry (R) bit to be transmitted in all the subsequent
MAC headers for this TBF as \'MS sent channel request message once\'. If
a second (EGPRS) PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST message is sent, the mobile
station shall change the value for the Retry (R) bit to \'MS sent
channel request message once or more\'.

While waiting for a response to the (EGPRS) PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST
message, the mobile station shall monitor the full PCCCH corresponding
to its PCCCH\_GROUP. The mobile station shall perform signal strength
measurements as they are defined for MAC-Idle state (see
3GPPÂ TSÂ 45.008).

While monitoring the full PCCCH, the mobile station shall decode any
occurrence of the PERSISTENCE\_LEVEL parameter included in a message
received on PCCCH. When the mobile station receives the
PERSISTENCE\_LEVEL parameter, the value of the PERSISTENCE\_LEVEL
parameter shall be taken into account at the next (EGPRS) PACKET CHANNEL
REQUEST attempt that follows.

The (EGPRS) PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST messages are sent on PRACH and
contain an indication of the type of access and parameters required to
indicate the mobile station\'s demand of radio resource.

There are two formats of the PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST message containing
either 8 bits or 11 bits of information. The format to be applied on
PRACH is controlled by the parameter ACC\_BURST\_TYPE which is broadcast
on PBCCH. The cause value to be used in the PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST
message for a non-EGPRS TBF mode capable MS depends on the purpose of
the packet access procedure as follows:

\- If the mobile station intends to use the TBF to send user data it
shall determine the RLC mode from the configuration of the radio bearer
for which the TBF is to be established. If the requested RLC mode is
acknowledged mode, the mobile station shall request either one phase
access or two phase access. If the requested RLC mode is unacknowledged
mode, the mobile station shall indicate in the PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST
message either One phase Access Request in RLC unacknowledged mode or
two phase access.

\- If the purpose of the packet access procedure is to send a message on
SRB1; in this case, the mobile station shall indicate either \'Single
Block Without TBF Establishment\' or \'One phase Access Request in RLC
unacknowledged mode\' in the PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST message.

\- If the purpose of the packet access procedure is to send a message on
SRB2-4 and a dedicated channel is not needed; in this case the mobile
station shall indicate \'MM Procedure\' in the PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST
message.

\- If the purpose of the packet access procedure is to send a message on
SRB2-4 and a dedicated channel is needed; in this case, the mobile
station shall indicate \'Dedicated channel request\' in the PACKET
CHANNEL REQUEST message

\- If the purpose of the packet access procedure is to initiate an
Emergency Call; in this case, the mobile station shall indicate
\'Emergency Call\' in the PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST message.

\- If the purpose of the packet access procedure is to request multiple
TBFs, the mobile station shall request a two phase access.

EGPRS TBF mode capable MSs shall monitor the GPRS Cell Options IE on the
PBCCH(PSI1/PSI13) for the cell\'s EGPRS capability. In the GPRS Cell
Options IE it is also indicated if the EGPRS PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST is
supported in the cell.

\- If the cell is EGPRS TBF mode capable and EGPRS PACKET CHANNEL
REQUEST is supported in the cell the EGPRS PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST
messages shall be used at one-phase access attempts (in RLC acknowledged
or unacknowledged mode), two-phase access attempts, sending of a message
on SRB2-4 if a dedicated channel is needed or initiation of an emergency
call. The corresponding cause value shall be used.

\- If the cell is EGPRS TBF mode capable and EGPRS PACKET CHANNEL
REQUEST messages are not supported in the cell or if the cell is not
EGPRS TBF mode capable, the EGPRS TBF mode capable mobile station shall
use the PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST message as for non-EGPRS TBF mode capable
MSs (see above).

##### 7.2.3.1.2 Access persistence control on PRACH

See 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.060 sub-clause 7.1.2.1.1.

#### 7.2.3.2 Packet assignment procedure

##### 7.2.3.2.1 On receipt of a PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST or EGPRS PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST message

##### 7.2.3.2.1.1 General {#general-15 .H6}

On receipt of a PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST or EGPRS PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST
message, the network may assign to the mobile station a radio resource
on either one or more SBPSCHs or on one or more DBPSCHs, based on the
cause field in the received message. The network shall not assign more
than one DBPSCH/S to the mobile station.

###### 7.2.3.2.1.2 Allocation of resource on SBPSCH(s)

See 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.060 sub-clause 7.1.2.2.1

###### 7.2.3.2.1.3 Allocation of resource on DBPSCH(s)

When the mobile station has been allocated a resource on one or more
DBPSCHs, the allocated dedicated resource is assigned to the mobile
station in a PACKETÂ DBPSCHÂ ASSIGNMENT message, sent on any PAGCH block
on the same PCCCH on which the network has received the PACKET CHANNEL
REQUEST or EGPRS PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST message. The *Packet Request
Reference* information element shall be used to address the mobile
station and frequency parameters shall be included.

The mobile station may use information received on PBCCH or a previous
assignment message to decode the frequency parameters contained in the
assignment message. If the mobile station detects an invalid *Frequency
Parameters* information element in the assignment message, it shall
abort the procedure, if required initiate a partial acquisition of PBCCH
information, and may then re-initiate this procedure.

In case the allocated channel type is PDTCH+PACCH+SACCH (see
3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.060), the network shall include the USF value to be used on
PDTCH and PACCH in the PACKETÂ DBPSCHÂ ASSIGNMENT message.

On receipt of a PACKETÂ DBPSCHÂ ASSIGNMENT message corresponding to one of
its 3 last PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST or EGPRS PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST
messages the mobile station shall stop timers T3186 and T3170 if running
and stop sending PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST or EGPRS PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST
messages. The mobile station shall then switch to the assigned
DBPSCH(s), enter the MAC-Dedicated state and proceed with contention
resolution of the one phase packet access procedure according to
sub-clause 7.2.3.3.2.

When the mobile station switches to the assigned DBPSCH(s), it shall
take into account the power control parameters received in downlink
SACCH blocks, perform signal strength measurements and apply output
power control procedures as they are defined for MAC-Dedicated state
(see 3GPPÂ TSÂ 45.008). The mobile station shall not send any measurement
reports until contention resolution is complete. It shall follow the
procedures in sub-clauses 9 and 11.

##### 7.2.3.2.1.4 Packet access queuing notification procedure {#packet-access-queuing-notification-procedure .H6}

See 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.060 sub-clause 7.1.2.2.2.

##### 7.2.3.2.1.5 Packet polling procedure {#packet-polling-procedure .H6}

See 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.060 sub-clause 7.1.2.2.3.

##### 7.2.3.2.1.6 Packet access reject procedure {#packet-access-reject-procedure .H6}

The network may, as response to a PACKETÂ CHANNELÂ REQUEST or
EGPRSÂ PACKETÂ CHANNELÂ REQUEST message, send to the mobile station a
PACKETÂ ACCESSÂ REJECT message on any PAGCH block on the same PCCCH on
which the channel-request message was received. This message contains
the request reference with time of reception of the
PACKETÂ CHANNELÂ REQUEST or EGPRSÂ PACKETÂ CHANNELÂ REQUEST message and
optionally a WAIT\_INDICATION field in the *Reject structure* of the
PACKETÂ ACCESSÂ REJECT message.

On receipt of a [PACKETÂ ACCESSÂ REJECT]{.smallcaps} message containing a
*Reject structure* addressed to the mobile station, where the *Packet
Request Reference* in the *Reject structure* corresponds to one of the
mobile station\'s last 3 [PACKETÂ CHANNELÂ REQUEST]{.smallcaps} or
EGPRSÂ [PACKETÂ CHANNELÂ REQUEST]{.smallcaps} messages:

\- The mobile station shall stop T3186, stop sending
[PACKETÂ CHANNELÂ REQUEST]{.smallcaps} or
EGPRSÂ [PACKETÂ CHANNELÂ REQUEST]{.smallcaps} messages, start T3172 with
the value indicated in the WAIT\_INDICATION field, start T3170 if it has
not already been started, and listen to the downlink PCCCH until T3170
expires. During this time, the mobile station shall ignore additional
[PACKETÂ ACCESSÂ REJECT]{.smallcaps} messages, but on reception of any
[PACKETÂ UPLINKÂ ASSIGNMENT]{.smallcaps} or
[PACKETÂ DBPSCHÂ ASSIGNMENT]{.smallcaps} message corresponding to any
other of its last 3 [PACKETÂ CHANNELÂ REQUEST]{.smallcaps} or
EGPRSÂ [PACKETÂ CHANNELÂ REQUEST]{.smallcaps} messages, the mobile station
shall stop T3170, stop T3172, and follow the procedure defined in
sub-clause 7.2.3.2.1.

\- If no [PACKETÂ UPLINKÂ ASSIGNMENT]{.smallcaps} or
[PACKETÂ DBPSCHÂ ASSIGNMENT]{.smallcaps} message is received before
expiration of T3170, the mobile station shall indicate a packet access
failure to upper layer and return to *MAC-Idle state.* As an option, the
mobile station may stop T3170, indicate a packet access failure to upper
layer and return to *MAC-Idle state* as soon as it has received
responses from the network on all, or in case more than 3 were sent, the
last 3 of its [PACKETÂ CHANNELÂ REQUEST]{.smallcaps} or
EGPRSÂ [PACKETÂ CHANNELÂ REQUEST]{.smallcaps} messages.

\- If an erroneous [PACKETÂ UPLINKÂ ASSIGNMENT]{.smallcaps} or
[PACKETÂ DBPSCHÂ ASSIGNMENT]{.smallcaps} message (*e.g.*, the mobile
station has been assigned more PDCHs than it supports according to its
multislot class) addressed to the mobile station is received before
expiration of T3170, the mobile station shall stop T3170 and act as
stated in sub-clause 7.2.5.

\- If the mobile station receives a
[PACKETÂ DOWNLINKÂ ASSIGNMENT]{.smallcaps} message, it shall stop T3170
and respond to the message (see sub-clause 7.3.2).

\- If the mobile station receives a
[PACKETÂ DBPSCHÂ ASSIGNMENT]{.smallcaps} message, it shall stop T3170 and
respond to the message (see sub-clause 7.3.3).

\- The mobile station shall not make a new attempt for packet access in
the same cell until T3172 expires, but may attempt packet access in
another cell after successful cell reselection for radio-conditions
reasons (see 3GPPÂ TSÂ 45.008).

\- The value of the WAIT\_INDICATION field (*i.e.*, T3172) relates to
the cell from which it was received.

#### 7.2.3.3 Contention resolution at one phase access

##### 7.2.3.3.1 Contention resolution at one phase access on SBPSCHs

The G-RNTI is used to uniquely identify the mobile station when sending
on uplink. The Radio bearer Id is used to identify the RLC instance to
which the RLC/MAC block belongs. Every RLC data block that is sent on
the TBF shall include the G-RNTI of the mobile station and the RB Id of
the RLC instance being addressed, until the contention resolution is
completed on the mobile station side. If MCS-7, MCS-8 or MCS-9 is used
for the transmission of the GâRNTI and RB Id in EGPRS TBF mode (i.e. the
RLC/MAC block is carrying two RLC data blocks), the G-RNTI and RB Id
shall be inserted in both RLC data blocks. The G-RNTI and RB Id shall
also be included in the PACKET RESOURCE REQUEST message, if sent during
the contention resolution. If ciphering is used, the least significant
bit of the uplink HFN of this radio bearer shall be inserted in each RLC
data block sent on the TBF and if applicable in the PACKET RESOURCE
REQUEST message until the contention resolution is completed on the
mobile station side. If the least significant bit of the HFN in the
network for the same radio bearer in the same direction is different
from the one received from the mobile station, the network shall
increase its HFN by one unit.

The retransmission of an RLC data block shall include the G-RNTI and RB
Id if the RLC data block was originally transmitted including these
fields, also if the retransmission occurs after the completion of the
contention resolution.

At sending of the first RLC data block, the mobile station shall stop
timer T3164, set counter N3104 to 1, and start timer T3166. The counter
N3104 shall be stepped each time the mobile station sends an RLC data
block.

The network shall respond by including the G-RNTI in the PACKET UPLINK
ACK/NACK message after the first correctly received RLC data block that
comprises the G-RNTI and RB Id. In EGPRS TBF mode, the network may
instead respond by addressing the mobile station with the TFI of the
assigned TBF and including the G-RNTI (in the
CONTENTION\_RESOLUTION\_TLLI field) in a PACKETÂ UPLINKÂ ASSIGNMENT
message, if the resources allocated for the TBF need to be reallocated
(see sub-clause 8.2.2.1.2).

The contention resolution is completed on the network side when the
network receives an RLC data block that comprises the G-RNTI value that
identifies the mobile station, the RB Id that identifies the RLC
instance being addressed and the TFI value associated with the TBF.

The contention resolution is successfully completed on the mobile
station side when the mobile station receives a PACKET UPLINK ACK/NACK
message addressing the mobile station with the TFI value associated with
the uplink TBF and including the same G-RNTI value that the mobile
station has included in the RLC header of the first RLC data blocks, or
alternatively, in EGPRS TBF mode, a PACKET UPLINK ASSIGNMENT message
addressing the mobile station with the TFI value associated with the
uplink TBF and including the same G-RNTI value that the mobile station
included in the RLC header of the first RLC data blocks. The mobile
shall then stop timer T3166 and counter N3104.

The contention resolution has failed on the mobile station side when the
counter N3104 reaches its maximum value, or timer T3166 expires. The
contention resolution also fails, if the mobile station receives a
PACKET UPLINK ACK/NACK message or in EGPRS TBF mode alternatively a
PACKETÂ UPLINKÂ ASSIGNMENT message addressing the mobile station with the
TFI associated with the uplink TBF and including a G-RNTI value other
than that the mobile station included in the RLC header of the first RLC
data blocks; in such a case, the mobile station shall not transmit a
PACKET CONTROL ACKNOWLEDGEMENT in the uplink radio block specified if a
valid RRBP field is received as part of the PACKET UPLINK ACK/NACK
message or in EGPRS TBF mode alternatively as part of the
PACKETÂ UPLINKÂ ASSIGNMENT message.

In case of a contention resolution failure on the mobile station side,
the mobile station shall reset the counter N3104 and stop timer T3166.
The mobile station shall stop transmitting on the TBF and reinitiate the
packet access procedure, unless the packet access procedure has already
been attempted four times. In that case, a TBF failure has occurred, see
sub-clause 7.2.5.

##### 7.2.3.3.2 Contention resolution at one phase access on DBPSCH

##### 7.2.3.3.2.1 General {#general-16 .H6}

During contention resolution the mobile station shall only send on the
RB for which packet access was initiated via the PCCCH. The RB may be
mapped onto a PDTCH, SDCCH or FACCH logical channel.

##### 7.2.3.3.2.2 Contention resolution at one phase access on PDTCH {#contention-resolution-at-one-phase-access-on-pdtch .H6}

The G-RNTI is used to identify uniquely the mobile station when sending
on uplink. The Radio bearer Id is used to identify the RLC instance to
which the RLC/MAC block belongs. Every RLC data block that is sent on
any of the mobile station\'s TBFs, shall include the G-RNTI of the
mobile station, until the contention resolution is completed on the
mobile station side.

The retransmission of an RLC data block shall include the G-RNTI if the
RLC data block was originally transmitted including this field, also if
the retransmission occurs after the completion of the contention
resolution.

At sending of the first RLC data block, the mobile station shall set
counter N3104 to 1, and start timer T3166. The counter N3104 shall be
incremented each time the mobile station sends a RLC data block.

The network shall respond by including the G-RNTI in the PACKET UPLINK
ACK/NACK message after the first correctly received RLC data block that
comprises the G-RNTI and valid RB Id.

The contention resolution is completed on the network side when the
network receives an RLC data block that comprises the G-RNTI value that
identifies the mobile station, and a valid RB Id that identifies the RLC
instance to which the RLC/MAC block belongs.

The contention resolution is successfully completed on the mobile
station side when the mobile station receives a PACKET UPLINK ACK/NACK
message addressing the mobile station with a valid RBId (contained in
the UPLINK\_TFI field, see 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.060) and including the same G-RNTI
value that the mobile station included in the RLC header of the first
RLC data blocks. The mobile station shall then stop timer T3166 and
counter N3104.

The contention resolution has failed on the mobile station side when the
counter N3104 reaches its maximum value, or timer T3166 expires. The
contention resolution also fails, if the mobile station receives a
PACKET UPLINK ACK/NACK message addressing the mobile station with a
G-RNTI value other than that the mobile station included in the RLC
header of the first RLC data blocks; in such a case, the mobile station
shall not transmit a PACKET CONTROL ACKNOWLEDGEMENT in the uplink radio
block specified if a valid RRBP field is received as part of the PACKET
UPLINK ACK/NACK message.

In case of a contention resolution failure on the mobile station side,
the mobile station shall reset the counter N3104 and stop timer T3166.
The mobile station shall stop transmitting on the TBF and reinitiate the
packet access procedure, unless the packet access procedure has already
been attempted four times. In that case, a TBF failure has occurred, see
sub-clause 7.2.5.

##### 7.2.3.3.2.3 Contention resolution at one phase access on SDCCH or FACCH {#contention-resolution-at-one-phase-access-on-sdcch-or-facch .H6}

The G-RNTI is used to identify uniquely the mobile station when sending
on uplink. The Reduced Radio bearer Id is used to identify the RLC
instance to which the RLC/MAC block belongs. Every RLC data block that
is sent on any of the mobile station\'s TBFs, shall include the G-RNTI
of the mobile station, until the contention resolution is completed on
the mobile station side.

The retransmission of an RLC data block shall include the G-RNTI if the
RLC data block was originally transmitted including this field, also if
the retransmission occurs after the completion of the contention
resolution.

At sending of the first RLC data block, the mobile station shall set
counter N3104 to 1, and start timer T3166. The counter N3104 shall be
incremented each time the mobile station sends a RLC data block.

The network shall respond by including the G-RNTI in the PACKET DBPSCH
UPLINK ACK/NACK message after the first correctly received RLC data
block that comprises the G-RNTI and valid RRB Id.

The contention resolution is completed on the network side when the
network receives an RLC data block that comprises the G-RNTI value that
identifies the mobile station, and a valid RRB Id that identifies the
RLC instance to which the RLC/MAC block belongs.

The contention resolution is successfully completed on the mobile
station side when the mobile station receives a PACKET DBPSCH UPLINK
ACK/NACK message addressing the mobile station with a valid RBId (i.e.
associated with an assigned RRB Id) and including the same G-RNTI value
that the mobile station included in the RLC header of the first RLC data
blocks. The mobile station shall then stop timer T3166 and counter
N3104.

The contention resolution has failed on the mobile station side when the
counter N3104 reaches its maximum value, or timer T3166 expires. The
contention resolution also fails, if the mobile station receives a
PACKET DBPSCH UPLINK ACK/NACK message addressing the mobile station with
a G-RNTI value other than that the mobile station included in the RLC
header of the first RLC data blocks; in such a case, the mobile station
shall not transmit a PACKET CONTROL ACKNOWLEDGEMENT even if the poll bit
is set in the received message.

In case of a contention resolution failure on the mobile station side,
the mobile station shall reset the counter N3104 and stop timer T3166.
The mobile station shall stop transmitting on the TBF and reinitiate the
packet access procedure, unless the packet access procedure has already
been attempted four times. In that case, a TBF failure has occurred, see
sub-clause 7.2.5.

#### 7.2.3.4 RLC/MAC procedures during contention resolution

##### 7.2.3.4.1 RLC/MAC procedures during contention resolution on SBPSCHs

During the contention resolution, the mobile station may receive a
non-distribution RLC/MAC control message addressing the mobile station
by G-RNTI or the TFI value associated with the uplink TBF. The mobile
station shall act on that message using the procedure defined for the
message when it is received in MAC-Shared state during operation on an
uplink TBF (see sub-clauseÂ 8), with the following restrictions:

\- The mobile station shall not accept a PACKET MEASUREMENT ORDER
message, a PACKET CELL CHANGE ORDER message and a PACKET POWER
CONTROL/TIMING ADVANCE message addressing the mobile station with the
TFI value associated with the uplink TBF.

\- The mobile station shall not accept a PACKET DOWNLINK ASSIGNMENT, a
MULTIPLE TBF DOWNLINK ASSIGNMENT, a PACKET TIMESLOT RECONFIGURE or a
MULTIPLE TBF TIMESLOT RECONFIGURE message.

If a valid RRBP field is received as part of the RLC/MAC control block
and the mobile station acts on the message, then it shall transmit a
PACKET CONTROL ACKNOWLEDGEMENT message in the uplink radio block
specified (see 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.060 sub-clause 10.4.5); The mobile station
shall not transmit a PACKET CONTROL ACKNOWLEDGEMENT message if it does
not act on the received message.

In either case, the mobile station shall continue with the contention
resolution on the uplink TBF, till it either completes successfully or
fails, or that the uplink TBF is released as a result of the procedure
defined for the message that is received.

During the contention resolution at one phase access, the mobile station
shall not send a Packet Resource Request message to request the
establishment of additional UL TBFs.

##### 7.2.3.4.2 RLC/MAC procedures during contention resolution on DBPSCHs

During the contention resolution, the mobile station may receive a
non-distribution RLC/MAC control message addressing the mobile station
by G-RNTI, RB Id (PACCH) or the RRB Id (SDCCH or FACCH) value associated
with one its uplink TBFs. The mobile station shall act on that message
using the procedure defined for the message in sub-clauseÂ 9.

If a RLC/MAC control block is received with the poll bitset or with
valid RRBP field and the mobile station acts on the message, then it
shall transmit a PACKET CONTROL ACKNOWLEDGEMENT message in the next
possible uplink occurrence on the same logical channel. The mobile
station shall continue with the contention resolution on the uplink TBF,
until it either completes successfully or fails, or that the uplink TBF
is released through release of the dedicated resource using the
CRLC-CONFIG primitive (see sub-clause 4.3.3.1)

#### 7.2.3.5 One phase packet access completion

##### 7.2.3.5.1 One phase packet access completion on SBPSCHs

See 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.060 sub-clause 7.1.2.4.

##### 7.2.3.5.2 One phase packet access completion on DBPSCHs

The one phase packet access procedure is completed upon a successful
contention resolution.

#### 7.2.3.6 Timing Advance

##### 7.2.3.6.1 Timing advance on SBPSCHs

See 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.060 sub-clause 7.1.2.5.

##### 7.2.3.6.2 Timing advance on DBPSCHs

Initial timing advance may be provided in the PACKETÂ DBPSCHÂ ASSIGNMENT
message in the TIMING\_ADVANCE\_VALUE field.

### 7.2.4 TBF establishment using two phase access

#### 7.2.4.1 Initiation of the Packet resource request procedure

In the first phase of a two-phase access, the same procedures as for
one-phase access shall be used until the network sends to the mobile
station a PACKETÂ UPLINKÂ ASSIGNMENT message including a *Single Block
Allocation struct* or a *Multi Block Allocation struct.*. The network
may only include a *Multi Block Allocation struct* if it sends the
PACKET UPLINK ASSIGNMENT message in response to an EGPRS PACKET CHANNEL
REQUEST.

A two-phase access may be initiated:

\- by the network, by ordering the mobile station to send a PACKET
RESOURCE REQUEST message. The order shall be sent implicitly to the
mobile station in the PACKETÂ UPLINKÂ ASSIGNMENT message by including a
*Single Block Allocation struct* or a *Multi Block Allocation struct*;

\- by a mobile station, by requiring a two-phase access in the PACKET
CHANNEL REQUEST or EGPRS PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST message. If access is
granted, the network shall order the mobile station to send a PACKET
RESOURCE REQUEST message. The order shall be sent implicitly to the
mobile station in the PACKETÂ UPLINKÂ ASSIGNMENT message by including a
*Single Block Allocation struct* or a *Multi Block Allocation struct*.

When the mobile station has received the PACKETÂ UPLINKÂ ASSIGNMENT
message, it shall respond with a PACKET RESOURCE REQUEST message in the
first allocated radio block. If the network allocated more than a single
radio block, the mobile station shall send any of the following in each
additional block:

-- Another control block (*e.g.*, a PACKET UPLINK DUMMY CONTROL BLOCK or
a PACKET MEASUREMENT REPORT message); however, the mobile station shall
not send an ADDITIONAL MS RADIO ACCESS CAPABILITIES message or a PACKET
RESOURCE REQUEST message.

-- Nothing.

The mobile station may request the establishment of multiple UL TBFs in
the PACKET RESOURCE REQUEST message. The *MS Radio Access Capability* IE
shall not be included in the PACKET RESOURCE REQUEST message. If
ciphering is used, the least significant bit of the uplink HFN of the
radio bearer for which radio resources are requested, shall be inserted
in the PACKET RESOURCE REQUEST message. If the least significant bit of
the HFN in the network for the same radio bearer in the same direction
is different from the one received from the mobile station, the network
shall increase its HFN by one unit.

When the mobile station switches to the assigned PDCH, it shall take the
power control parameters received in the PACKETÂ UPLINKÂ ASSIGNMENT
message into account, perform signal strength measurements and apply
output power control procedures as they are defined for MAC-Shared state
(see 3GPPÂ TSÂ 45.008).

At sending of the PACKET RESOURCE REQUEST message, the mobile station
shall start timer T3168 for each of the radio bearers for which
resources were requested. Furthermore, the mobile station shall not
respond to PACKETÂ DOWNLINKÂ ASSIGNMENT or MULTIPLE TBF DOWNLINK
ASSIGNMENT messages - but may acknowledge such messages if they contain
a valid RRBP field - while timer T3168 is running, before contention
resolution is completed on the mobile station side.

The mobile station may indicate in the PACKET RESOURCE REQUEST message
the number of octets of user data it has to transfer.

#### 7.2.4.2 Packet resource assignment for uplink procedure

##### 7.2.4.2.1 (void)

##### 7.2.4.2.2 On receipt of a PACKET RESOURCE REQUEST message

On receipt of a PACKET RESOURCE REQUEST message, the network shall
respond by sending a PACKETÂ UPLINKÂ ASSIGNMENT or MULTIPLE TBF UPLINK
ASSIGNMENT message (radio resources assignment on one or more PDCHs to
be used by the mobile station for the TBF in EGPRS or GPRS TBF mode) or
a PACKET ACCESS REJECT message to the mobile station on PACCH on the
same PDCH on which the mobile station has sent the PACKET RESOURCE
REQUEST message. These messages may only be for a subset of the
resources requested in the PACKET RESOURCE REQUEST message. For the
resource requests that have not been processed by the first assignment
or reject message, additional PACKETÂ UPLINKÂ ASSIGNMENT, MULTIPLE TBF
UPLINK ASSIGNMENT or PACKET ACCESS REJECT messages may be sent to the
mobile station on the PACCH to which the mobile station has been
assigned.

On receipt of a PACKETÂ UPLINKÂ ASSIGNMENT or MULTIPLE TBF UPLINK
ASSIGNMENT message the mobile station shall switch to the assigned
PDCHs. If dynamic or extended dynamic allocation is assigned then start
timer T3164 for each of the TBFs that have been assigned resources.

At sending of the first RLC data block on a TBF, the mobile station
shall stop timer T3164 for that TBF.

The mobile station may use information received on PBCCH or a previous
assignment message to decode the frequency parameters contained in the
assignment message. If the mobile station detects an invalid Frequency
Parameters information element in the assignment message, it shall abort
the procedure, if required initiate a *partial acquisition* of PBCCH
information, and may then re-initiate the access on the PRACH.

On receipt of a PACKET ACCESS REJECT message that contains a Reject
structure addressed to the mobile station, the mobile station shall stop
timer T3168 and indicate a packet access failure to upper layer for
those TBFs identified as rejected in the message.

If the PACKET ACCESS REJECT message contains a WAIT\_INDICATION field in
a Reject structure addressed to the mobile station, the mobile station
shall start timer T3172 with the indicated value (Wait Indication). The
mobile station is not allowed to make a new attempt for packet access in
the same cell until all instances of timer T3172 expires, but may
attempt packet access in another cell after successful cell reselection.

#### 7.2.4.3 Contention resolution at two phase access

The contention resolution is completed on the network side when the
network receives a G-RNTI value identifying the mobile station, as part
of the contention resolution procedure on the TBF.

The contention resolution is completed on the mobile station side when
the mobile station receives a PACKETÂ UPLINKÂ ASSIGNMENT message or
MULTIPLE TBF UPLINK ASSIGNMENT message with the same G-RNTI as the
mobile station has included in the PACKET RESOURCE REQUEST message and
assigning resource to at least one radio bearer that requested resource
in the PACKET RESOURCE REQUEST message. The mobile station shall then
stop timer T3168 for each radio bearer for which resource is granted. It
does not include its G-RNTI in any RLC data block.

The contention resolution has failed on the mobile station side when the
mobile station does not receive a PACKETÂ UPLINKÂ ASSIGNMENT message or
MULTIPLE TBF UPLINK ASSIGNMENT message with its G-RNTI, assigning
resource to at least one radio bearer that requested resource in the
PACKET RESOURCE REQUEST message, before expiry of timer T3168. The
mobile station shall then reinitiate the packet access procedure unless
the packet access procedure has already been attempted four times. In
that case, TBF failure has occurred for all of the requested TBF(s) and
an RLC/MAC error should be reported to the higher layer for each of the
radio bearers that requested resources.

On expiry of an instance of timer T3168 after contention resolution is
completed on the mobile station side, TBF establishment for the
corresponding radio bearer has failed. In that case the mobile station
shall reinitiate resource request for that radio bearer using the
procedures described in sub-clause 8.2.2.1.2

#### 7.2.4.4 Two phase packet access completion

See 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.060 sub-clause 7.1.3.4.

#### 7.2.4.5 Timing Advance

See 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.060 sub-clause 7.1.3.5.

### 7.2.5 Abnormal cases

If a failure occurs on the mobile station side of the new TBF before the
mobile station has successfully completed contention resolution, the
newly reserved resources are released; the subsequent behaviour of the
mobile station depends on the type of failure and previous actions.

\- If the failure is due to a G-RNTI mismatch, or to the expiry of
timers T3166 or T3168, or to the fact that the counter N3104 reaches its
maximum value in the contention resolution procedure, and repetition as
described in sub-clauses 7.2.3.3, 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.060 sub-clause 7.1.3.2.1 or
sub-clause 7.1.3.3 has been performed, the mobile station shall return
to MAC-Idle state, notify higher layer (TBF establishment failure),
transactions in progress shall be aborted and cell reselection may take
place, unless the failure takes place during a Packet Cell Change Order
procedure, in which case the mobile behaviour shall be as described in
the Abnormal cases of theNetwork controlled cell reselection procedure
in 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.060 sub-clause 8.4.2.

\- If the mobile station has been assigned more PDCHs than it supports
according to its MS multislot class, the mobile station shall reinitiate
the packet access procedure unless the packet access procedure has
already been attempted four times. In that case, TBF failure has
occurred.

\- If the information in the PACKETÂ UPLINKÂ ASSIGNMENT message does not
properly specify an uplink PDCH or violates the mobile station\'s
multislot capabilities, the mobile station shall reinitiate the packet
access procedure unless the packet access procedure has already been
attempted four times. In that case, TBF failure has occurred.

\- If the mobile station has been assigned more than one DBPSCH/S, the
mobile station shall reinitiate the packet access procedure unless the
packet access procedure has been attempted four times. In that case, TBF
failure has occurred.

\- If the information in the PACKET DBPSCH ASSIGNMENT message does not
properly specify a DBPSCH or violates the mobile station\'s multislot
capabilities, the mobile station shall reinitiate the packet access
procedure (i.e. using access cause \"dedicated channel request\") unless
the packet access procedure has already been attempted four times. In
that case, TBF failure has occurred.

\- If the mobile station has been assigned a TCH that it does not
support (e.g. using 8-PSK), the mobile station shall return to MAC-Idle
state and notify higher layers (TBF establishment failure).

\- If the information in the MULTIPLE TBF UPLINKÂ ASSIGNMENT message does
not properly specify an uplink PDCH or violates the mobile station\'s
multislot capabilities, the mobile station shall reinitiate the packet
access procedure for each of the TBFs for which there is an error unless
the procedure has already been attempted 4 times for the TBF. In that
case, TBF failure has occurred.

> \- If the MULTIPLE TBF UPLINKÂ ASSIGNMENT message contains assignments
> for radio bearers for which a TBF was not requested, the mobile
> station shall not act upon these assignments. The mobile station shall
> act upon the valid assignments.
>
> \- If the MULTIPLE TBF UPLINKÂ ASSIGNMENT message contains assignments
> such that more than one RB is mapped onto one TBF, then TBF failure
> has occurred for each of the RBs that are mapped onto the same TBF.

\- If the mobile station has been assigned a TBF in EGPRS mode and the
MS does not support EGPRS, or has been assigned an MCS (e.g. 8-PSK in
the Uplink) that the MS does not support, the MS shall return to
MAC-Idle state and notify higher layers (TBF establishment failure).

\- On expiry of timer T3164, the mobile station shall reinitiate the
packet access procedure for the related RB unless the packet access
procedure has already been attempted four times for this RB, in which
case the mobile station shall notify higher layers of TBF establishment
failure. If the mobile station has no remaining TBFs it shall return to
MAC-Idle state.

\- If the failure is due to any other reason, the mobile station shall
return to MAC-Idle state, notify higher layer (TBF establishment
failure), transactions in progress shall be aborted and cell reselection
continues.

7.3 TBF establishment initiated by the network on PCCCH
-------------------------------------------------------

### 7.3.1 General

The purpose of network initiated TBF establishment is to establish a TBF
to support the transfer of upper layer PDUs in the direction from the
network to the mobile station. The procedure may be entered when the
mobile station is in MACâIdle state. Network initiated TBF establishment
can also be done on PACCH if a TBF for transfer of upper layer PDUs in
the direction from the mobile station to the network is already
established (sub-clause 8.2.3.5).

If the mobile station is in MAC-Dedicated state the establishment of a
TBF shall be performed by procedures that are specified in
3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.118.

### 7.3.2 Entering the MAC-Shared state

#### 7.3.2.1 General

The procedure is triggered by a request from upper layers on the network
side to transfer an upper layer PDU to a mobile station in MAC-Idle
state. The request is implicit when receiving an upper layer PDU to a
mobile station not already having any assigned radio resources. Upon
such a request, the network shall initiate a packet downlink assignment
procedure as defined in sub-clause 7.3.2.2.

#### 7.3.2.2 Packet downlink assignment procedure

##### 7.3.2.2.1 Packet downlink assignment procedure

See 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.060 sub-clause 7.2.1.1.

##### 7.3.2.2.2 HFN synchronization

If ciphering is used, the least significant bit of the downlink HFN of
this radio bearer shall be inserted in the PACKET DOWNLINK ASSIGNMENT
message sent in the packet downlink assignment procedure (see sub-clause
7.3.2.2.1). If the least significant bit of the HFN in the mobile
station for the same radio bearer in the same direction is different
from the one received from the network, the mobile station shall
increase its HFN by one unit.

#### 7.3.2.3 Packet downlink assignment procedure completion

See 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.060 sub-clause 7.2.1.2.

#### 7.3.2.4 Packet polling procedure

See 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.060 sub-clause 7.2.1.3.

#### 7.3.2.5 Abnormal cases

See 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.060 sub-clause 7.2.2.

### 7.3.3 Entering the MAC-Dedicated state

#### 7.3.3.1 General

The procedure is triggered by a request from upper layers on the network
side to transfer an upper layer PDU to a mobile station in MAC-Idle
state. The request is implicit when receiving an upper layer PDU to a
mobile station not already having any assigned radio resources and the
request requires dedicated resources. Upon such a request, the network
shall initiate a packet DBPSCH assignment procedure as defined in
sub-clause 7.3.3.2.

#### 7.3.3.2 Packet DBPSCH assignment procedure

The network may assign a radio resource on one or more DBPSCHs to be
used for the TBF. The amount of radio resources to be reserved is a
network dependent choice. The network shall not assign radio resources
on more than one DBPSCH/S to the TBF.

The allocated radio resource is assigned to the mobile station in a
PACKET DBPSCHÂ ASSIGNMENT message to the mobile station. The
PACKETÂ DBPSCHÂ ASSIGNMENT message is transmitted on the PCCCH timeslot
corresponding to the PCCCH group the mobile station belongs to. The
appropriate PCCCH group is calculated from the IMSI (see
3GPPÂ TSÂ 45.002). The behaviour of the network when the IMSI is not
provided by the upper layers is implementation dependent for the
calculation of the PCCCH group where the PACKETÂ DBPSCHÂ ASSIGNMENT
message has to be sent. If the mobile station is in non-DRX mode or if
the IMSI or the DRX parameters are not provided by the upper layers,
there is no further restriction on what part of the downlink PCCCH
timeslot this PACKET DBPSCH ASSIGNMENT message can be sent, provided
that this part corresponds to one or more blocks where paging may
appear. If the mobile station applies DRX, this message shall be sent in
one or more PCCCH block(s) corresponding to a paging group determined
for the mobile station in MAC-Idle state (see 3GPPÂ TSÂ 45.002). The
multislot capabilities of the mobile station shall be considered.

Initial timing advance can be provided in the PACKETÂ DBPSCHÂ ASSIGNMENT
message as Timing Advance Value field. For the case where Timing Advance
Value is not provided in the assignment message, the mobile station is
not allowed to send normal bursts (e.g. PACKET DOWNLINK ACK/NACK
message) on the uplink until it receives a valid timing advance on the
SACCH.

The mobile station shall use information received on the PBCCH to decode
the channel descriptions contained in the assignment. If frequency
hopping is applied, the mobile station shall use the last CA received on
PBCCH to decode the Mobile Allocation. Alternatively, the network may
provide a Mobile Allocation in the assignment. The radio resource is
assigned to the mobile station in a PACKETÂ DBPSCHÂ ASSIGNMENT message. On
receipt of a PACKET DBPSCH ASSIGNMENT message, the mobile station shall
switch to the assigned DBPSCHs.

If the mobile station receives more than one PACKETÂ DBPSCHÂ ASSIGNMENT
message while it monitors the PCCCH, it shall act upon the most recently
received message and shall ignore the previous message.

When the PACKETÂ DBPSCHÂ ASSIGNMENT message is received the mobile station
shall switch to the assigned DBPSCH(s), start timer T3190 and enters the
MAC-Dedicated state. The timer T3190 is restarted when receiving the
first valid RLC data block addressed to itself.

When the mobile station switches to the assigned DBPSCHs, it shall take
the power control parameters received in the PACKETÂ DBPSCHÂ ASSIGNMENT
message into account, perform signal strength measurements and apply
output power control procedures as they are defined for MAC-Dedicated
state (see 3GPPÂ TSÂ 45.008).

On expiry of timer T3190, the mobile station shall abort the procedure
and return to MAC-Idle state.

#### 7.3.3.3 Packet DBPSCH assignment procedure completion

The Packet DBPSCH assignment procedure is completed when the mobile
station receives a valid RLC/MAC block.

#### 7.3.3.4 Packet polling procedure

On receipt of a control message with the poll bit set, the mobile
station shall respond to the network with the PACKET CONTROL
ACKNOWLEDGEMENT message.

#### 7.3.3.5 Abnormal cases

If a failure occurs on the mobile station side of the new TBF before
mobile station has successfully entered the MAC-Dedicated state, the
newly reserved resources are released; the subsequent behaviour of the
mobile station depends on the type of failure and previous actions.

\- If the mobile station has been assigned more DBPSCHs than it supports
according to its MS multislot class, the mobile station shall ignore the
assignment and return to MAC-Idle state.

\- If the mobile station has been assigned more than one DBPSCH/S, the
mobile station shall ignore the assignment and return to MAC-Idle state

\- On expiry of timer T3190, the mobile station shall return to MAC-Idle
state.

\- If the failure is due to any other reason, the mobile station shall
ignore the assignment and return to MAC-Idle state and cell reselection
continues.

7.4 Procedure for measurement report sending in MAC-Idle state
--------------------------------------------------------------

### 7.4.1 General

The procedure for measurement report sending shall be initiated by the
mobile station at expiry the NC measurement report interval timer T3158.
At expiry of the timer T3158 shall restart the expired timer T3158,
perform the measurements and initiate the packet access.

The procedure for measurement report sending is initiated by the mobile
station on PCCCH (sub-clause 7.4.2).

If the mobile station initiates the establishment of a DBPSCH, the timer
T3158 shall be stopped and no measurement reports shall be sent. When
the last DBPSCH is released and if the mobile station has not changed
cell, the measurement reporting procedure shall be restarted.

If a cell change has occurred while the mobile station had one or more
DBPSCHs allocated, the measurements shall be cancelled until new NC
orders have been received (see sub-clause 5.5).

### 7.4.2 Measurement report sending procedure initiated on PCCCH

#### 7.4.2.1 General

The packet access procedure is initiated by the MAC entity in the mobile
station as specified in sub-clauses 7.2.3.1 and 7.2.3.2 but with access
type \"Single block without TBF establishment\" indicated in the PACKET
CHANNEL REQUEST message.

#### 7.4.2.2 On receipt of a PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST message

See 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.060 sub-clause 7.3.1.1.

#### 7.4.2.3 On receipt of a PACKETÂ UPLINKÂ ASSIGNMENT message

See 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.060 sub-clause 7.3.1.2.

#### 7.4.2.4 On receipt of a PACKET ACCESS REJECT message

See 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.060 sub-clause 7.3.1.3.

#### 7.4.2.5 Abnormal cases

See 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.060 sub-clause 7.3.1.4.

7.5 Cell Change Order procedures in MAC-Idle state
--------------------------------------------------

### 7.5.1 General

For an individual mobile station in MAC-Idle state, the network may
initiate the cell change order procedure on PCCCH.

The network may initiate the cell change order procedure by sending a
PACKET CELL CHANGE ORDER message in a PCCCH block monitored by the
mobile station. No TBF shall be established.

The PACKET CELL CHANGE ORDER message contains:

\- The characteristics of the new cell that are necessary to identify it
(i.e. BSIC + BCCH frequency).

\- The NC measurement parameters valid for the mobile station in the new
cell (NETWORK\_CONTROL\_ORDER and optionally: NC\_NON\_DRX\_PERIOD,
NC\_REPORTING\_PERIOD\_I and NC\_REPORTING\_PERIOD\_T).

For a multi-RAT mobile station, the PACKET CELL CHANGE ORDER message may
contain information on a 3G target cell; in the case of UTRAN, the
establishment of channel(s) and subsequent measurement reporting are
defined in 3GPPÂ TSÂ 25.331.

Upon receipt of the PACKET CELL CHANGE ORDER message, the mobile station
shall stop all relevant RLC/MAC timers except for timers related to
measurement reporting and start timer T3174. The mobile station shall
then switch to the specified new cell and obey the relevant RLC/MAC
procedures on this new cell. If a valid RRBP field was received in the
PACKET CELL CHANGE ORDER message then the MS shall send a PACKET CONTROL
ACKNOWLEDMENT message in the reserved uplink radio block specified by
the RRBP field before switching to the new cell. If the timers related
to measurement reporting expire while the reselection procedure has not
yet been completed, these timers shall be restarted so that the mobile
station resumes the measurement reporting procedures once camped on the
new cell. The mobile station shall obey the PACKET CELL CHANGE ORDER
message irrespective of whether or not the mobile station has any
knowledge of the relative synchronisation of the target cell to the
serving cell. A UTRAN capable mobile station shall obey the command
irrespective of whether the cell is known or not known (see
3GPPÂ TSÂ 25.133 and 3GPPÂ TSÂ 25.123).

The procedure for completion of the cell change order is defined in
3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.060 sub-clause 8.4.1 and abnormal procedures are defined in
3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.060 sub-clause 8.4.2.

7.6 Measurement Order procedures in MAC-Idle state
--------------------------------------------------

### 7.6.1 General

To send the NC Measurement order to an individual mobile station in
MACâIdle state, the network may establish a connection on PCCCH.

### 7.6.2 Measurement Order procedures initiated on PCCCH

See 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.060 sub-clause 7.5.1.

8 Medium Access Control (MAC) procedures on SBPSCH
==================================================

8.1 General
-----------

The MAC procedures defined in this sub-clause are applicable in
MAC-Shared state and MAC-DTM state.

The full set of downlink assignment messages comprises the PACKET
DOWNLINK ASSIGNMENT, PACKET TIMESLOT RECONFIGURE, MULTIPLE TBF DOWNLINK
ASSIGNMENT and MULTIPLE TBF TIMESLOT RECONFIGURE messages.

The full set of uplink assignment messages comprises the PACKET UPLINK
ASSIGNMENT, PACKET TIMESLOT RECONFIGURE, MULTIPLE TBF UPLINK ASSIGNMENT
and MULTIPLE TBF TIMESLOT RECONFIGURE messages.

The network may choose to send either single assignment messages (PACKET
UPLINK ASSIGNMENT, PACKET DOWNLINK ASSIGNMENT, PACKET TIMESLOT
RECONFIGURE) or multiple TBF assignment messages (MULTIPLE TBF DOWNLINK
ASSIGNMENT, MULTIPLE TBF UPLINK ASSIGNMENT, MULTIPLE TBF TIMESLOT
RECONFIGURE) on the PACCH. The network shall only use the multiple TBF
assignment messages when assigning or reallocating the mobile station
with more than one uplink TBF and/or more than one downlink TBF.

8.1a Resource stealing (SFACCH)
-------------------------------

The use of SFACCH in MAC-Shared state for SRBs 1 through 4 is specified
in sub-clause 5.6.2.2.

The use of SFACCH in MAC-DTM state for SRBs 3 and 4 is specified in
sub-clause 5.6.2.3. SFACCH shall not be used for SRBs 1 and 2 in MAC-DTM
state.

If the mobile station has data to send for an SRB that can be sent on
SFACCH, and neither a TBF nor a TBF establishment request is ongoing for
this SRB, the following procedure applies:

\- The mobile station may select a current TBF on an SBPSCH, construct
an uplink RLC data block that includes octet 3 (this octet contains the
SRBid), and send the SRB data at the TBF\'s next scheduled transmission
opportunity for an RLC data block. GERAN shall use the SRBid to route
the SRB data to the correct RLC instance.

\- Otherwise, the mobile station shall initiate a new TBF operating on
an SBPSCH (see sub-clause 8.2.2.0.2).

If the mobile station has data to send for an SRB, and a TBF exists for
this SRB, the following procedure applies:

\- The mobile station shall construct an uplink RLC data block that does
not include octet 3 and send the SRB data on the TBF.

If GERAN has data to send for an SRB that can be sent on SFACCH, and no
TBF exists for this SRB, the following procedure applies:

\- GERAN may select a current TBF on an SBPSCH, construct a downlink RLC
data block that includes octet 3, and send the SRB data at the TBF\'s
next scheduled transmission opportunity for an RLC data block. The
mobile station shall use the SRBid to route the SRB data to the correct
RLC instance.

\- Otherwise, GERAN shall establish a new TBF operating on an SBPSCH
(see sub-clause 8.2.2.0.2).

If GERAN has data to send for an SRB, and a TBF exists for this SRB, the
following procedure applies:

\- GERAN shall construct a downlink RLC data block that does not include
octet 3 and send the SRB data on the TBF.

8.2 Transfer of RLC data blocks
-------------------------------

### 8.2.1 Medium access mode

The transfer of RLC data blocks on SBPSCH is governed by different
principles on both uplink and downlink for each of the defined medium
access modes: dynamic allocation, extended dynamic allocation, and
exclusive allocation.

The medium access mode the mobile station is to use, except when
exclusive allocation is applied in MAC-DTM state, is given by the
MAC\_MODE parameter. The MAC\_MODE parameter is included in the downlink
assignment (e.g. PACKETÂ DOWNLINKÂ ASSIGNMENT or PACKET TIMESLOT
RECONFIGURE) message, whereas in the uplink the MAC\_MODE parameter is
given by the EXTENDED\_DYNAMIC\_ALLOCATION parameter. The value of the
MAC\_MODE parameter shall not be changed while the mobile station is in
MAC-Shared state or MAC-DTM state.

Exclusive allocation is applicable only in MAC-DTM state when a single
TBF is allocated on a half-rate PDCH.

When the conditions for exclusive allocation are fulfilled, the mobile
station shall store the value of the MAC\_MODE parameter. The MAC\_MODE
parameter has no effect as long as exclusive allocation is used. When
the conditions for exclusive allocation are not fulfilled, the mobile
station shall use the medium access mode given by the value of the
MAC\_MODE parameter.

### 8.2.2 Uplink RLC data block transfer

##### 8.2.2.0 General

##### 8.2.2.0.1 General

See 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.060 sub-clause 8.1.1.

##### 8.2.2.0.2 Establishment of additional uplink TBF(s)

When the mobile station has data to send that does not have the same
radio bearer identity as (any of) the uplink TBF(s) or TBF request(s) in
progress, the mobile station shall request uplink resources through one
of the following procedures:

\- If the data belongs to a signalling radio bearer

\- Use the SFACCH (see sub-clause 8.1a)

\- Establish an additional TBF (sub-clause 8.2.2.1.2)

\- If the mobile station cannot support the establishment of an
additional TBF, then the network may release an on-going TBF in order to
establish a new TBF (sub-clause 8.2.2.1.2)

\- If the data belongs to a user radio bearer

\- Establish an additional TBF (sub-clause 8.2.2.1.2)

\- If the mobile station cannot support the establishment of an
additional TBF, then the network may release an on-going TBF in order to
establish a new TBF (sub-clause 8.2.2.1.2)

##### 8.2.2.0.3 Uplink resource reallocation / reconfiguration

Neither the mobile station nor the network are allowed to modify the RLC
mode, TBF mode or radio bearer identity of an already established TBF.
If the mobile station has data to send that requires a modification of
existing uplink resources, an uplink resource request shall be sent, see
sub-clause 8.2.2.0.2.

If no modifications to the uplink resources are required, the network
may reallocate existing resources through one of the following
procedures:

\- The network may send a PACKET TIMESLOT RECONFIGURE or MULTIPLE TBF
TIMESLOT RECONFIGURE message to the mobile station on the PACCH to
reallocate uplink (and also downlink) resources, see sub-clause
8.2.2.1.2.2.

\- The network may send a PACKET UPLINK ASSIGNMENT or MULTIPLE TBF
UPLINK ASSIGNMENT message to the mobile station on the PACCH to
reallocate uplink resources, see sub-clause 8.2.2.1.2.2.

##### 8.2.2.0.4 Establishment of downlink TBF(s)

During uplink data transfer, the network may initiate downlink data
transfer for one or more TBFs by sending a downlink assignment message
to the mobile station on the downlink PACCH.

The network initiates assignment of a single downlink TBF by sending a
PACKETÂ DOWNLINKÂ ASSIGNMENT or a PACKET TIMESLOT RECONFIGURE message. The
network initiates assignment of more than one downlink TBF by sending a
MULTIPLE TBFÂ DOWNLINKÂ ASSIGNMENT or a MULTIPLE TBF TIMESLOT RECONFIGURE
message.

The procedure to be followed is described in sub-clause 8.2.2.1.3.

#### 8.2.2.1 Dynamic Allocation uplink RLC data block transfer

See 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.060 sub-clause 8.1.1.1.

##### 8.2.2.1.1 PACCH operation

See 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.060 sub-clause 8.1.1.1.1.

##### 8.2.2.1.2 Resource Allocation / Reallocation for Uplink

##### 8.2.2.1.2.1 General {#general-27 .H6}

The mobile station shall initiate the uplink resource (re)allocation
procedure by sending a PACKET RESOURCE REQUEST message on the PACCH and
starting timer T3168 for each TBF request included in the Iu mode
Channel Request Description IE.

####### 8.2.2.1.2.2 On receipt of the PACKET RESOURCE REQUEST

On receipt of the PACKET RESOURCE REQUEST message the network shall
respond by sending one or more uplink assignment messages (e.g. PACKET
UPLINK ASSIGNMENT, MULTIPLE TBF UPLINK ASSIGNMENT, MULTIPLE TBF TIMESLOT
RECONFIGURE or PACKET TIMESLOT RECONFIGURE) and/or a PACKET ACCESS
REJECT message and/or a PACKET TBF RELEASE message to the mobile station
on the downlink PACCH.

When the mobile station has already been allocated the maximum number of
TBFs in the uplink direction that it can support, the network shall
respond with either a PACKET ACCESS REJECT message, or a PACKET TBF
RELEASE message followed by an uplink assignment message.

On receipt of an uplink assignment message the mobile station shall stop
timer T3168 for each uplink TBF assigned in the assignment message and
switch to the assigned SBPSCHs. A new assignment shall not terminate the
previous assignment unless the uplink assignment message explicitly
contains a reassignment for an on-going TBF.

On expiry of timer T3168 the mobile station shall retransmit the PACKET
RESOURCE REQUEST message for the TBF(s) for which T3168 has expired
unless the PACKET RESOURCE REQUEST message has already been transmitted
four times for this TBF in which case the mobile station shall indicate
a packet access failure to upper layer and perform an abnormal release
without retry (see sub-clause 8.7.1).

If no uplink assignment message is received for a TBF for which timer
T3168 is running before the mobile station has completed its currently
assigned TBF(s), the mobile station shall stop timer T3168 for that TBF,
return to MAC-Idle state and start the packet access procedure on the
PCCCH.

The network may at any time during an uplink TBF initiate a change of
resources or allocation of new resources by sending on the downlink
PACCH monitored by the MS, an unsolicited uplink assignment message to
the mobile station.

On receipt of a PACKET ACCESS REJECT message, the mobile station shall
stop timer T3168, if running, for each TBF request rejected in the
PACKET ACCESS REJECT message and indicate a packet access failure to the
upper layer. If no other uplink or downlink TBFs exist, the mobile
station in MAC-Shared state shall return to MAC-Idle state; the mobile
station in MAC-DTM state shall return to MAC-Dedicated state. The DRX
mode procedures shall be applied, as specified in sub-clause 5.5.1.5.

If the PACKET ACCESS REJECT message contains a WAIT\_INDICATION field in
a Reject structure addressed to the mobile station, the mobile station
shall

\- start timer T3172 for each TBF request rejected in the message
(listed by radio bearer identity). The mobile station is not allowed to
make a new attempt for an uplink TBF establishment for this radio bearer
in the same cell until this instance of timer T3172 expires. It may
attempt a TBF establishment for another radio bearer while T3172 is
running. It may attempt an uplink TBF establishment in another cell
after successful cell reselection. While T3172 is running, the mobile
station shall ignore all received PACKET PAGING REQUEST messages.

The value of the WAIT\_INDICATION field (i.e. timer T3172) relates to
the cell from which it was received.

##### 8.2.2.1.2.3 Abnormal cases {#abnormal-cases-4 .H6}

The following abnormal cases apply:

\- If the mobile station receives a PACKETÂ UPLINKÂ ASSIGNMENT, MULTIPLE
TBF UPLINKÂ ASSIGNMENT, PACKET TIMESLOT RECONFIGURE or MULTIPLE TBF

##### 8.2.2.1.3 Establishment of downlink TBF

###### 8.2.2.1.3.1 General

During uplink transfer, the network may initiate one or more downlink
TBFs by sending a downlink assignment message (e.g.
PACKETÂ DOWNLINKÂ ASSIGNMENT, PACKET TIMESLOT RECONFIGURE, MULTIPLE TBF
DOWNLINK ASSIGNMENT, MULTIPLE TBF TIMESLOT RECONFIGURE) to the mobile
station on the PACCH.

If a PACKET TIMESLOT RECONFIGURE message is sent, then the message shall
contain the DOWNLINK\_TFI\_ASSIGNMENT field. The multislot restrictions
of the mobile station shall be observed.

A mobile allocation or reference frequency list, received as part of a
downlink assignment, replaces the previous parameters and shall be used
until a new assignment is received or the mobile station has released
all TBFs.

On receipt of a downlink assignment message, and after the TBF starting
time, if present, the mobile station shall switch to the assigned
SBPSCHs, and start timer T3190 for each TBF. The operation of the
downlink TBF follows the procedures in sub-clause 8.2.3 and
3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.060 sub-clause 8.1.2 with the following additions:

\- the mobile station shall prioritise transmission of RLC/MAC control
blocks associated with the downlink TBF over RLC/MAC control blocks
associated with the uplink TBF;

\- if a timer or counter expiry causes the uplink TBF to be aborted in
the mobile station triggering an abnormal release with access retry on
PCCCH (see sub-clause 8.8.3), the mobile station shall also abort all
downlink TBF(s). The mobile station shall not abort the downlink TBF(s)
in case an abnormal release with access retry on PACCH is triggered;

\- If both uplink and downlink TBFs are already established and if more
than one TBF is already established in either/both direction(s), then
the network may send a MULTIPLE TBF TIMESLOT RECONFIGURE message. If
this message contains a change in frequency in the frequency parameters
and does not contain a reassignment for one or more of the mobile
station\'s TBFs, these TBFs are to be released upon moving to the new
frequency. If no change in frequency parameters is included, the TBFs
not explicitly reconfigured shall continue according to their original
assignment.

###### 8.2.2.1.3.2 Abnormal cases

In the following abnormal cases it is assumed that at least one uplink
TBF exists. The subsequent behaviour of the mobile station depends on
the type of failure and previous actions:

> \- If the information in the PACKET TIMESLOT RECONFIGURE or MULTIPLE
> TBF TIMESLOT RECONFIGURE message incorrectly specifies an uplink
> and/or downlink PDCH, the mobile station shall perform an abnormal
> release of the downlink TBF(s) with erroneous assignments (see
> sub-clause 8.8.6). The mobile station shall act upon the valid
> assignments.
>
> \- If the information in the PACKET TIMESLOT RECONFIGURE or MULTIPLE
> TBF TIMESLOT RECONFIGURE message violates the mobile station\'s
> multislot capabilities, the mobile station shall perform an abnormal
> release with access retry (see sub-clause 8.8.3).

\- If a downlink TBF is not already established and the PACKET TIMESLOT
RECONFIGURE message does not include a DOWNLINK\_TFI\_ASSIGNMENT field,
then the mobile station shall perform an abnormal release with access
retry (sub-clause 8.8.3).

\- If a downlink TBF is not already established and the MULTIPLE TBF
TIMESLOT RECONFIGURE message does not assign any downlink TBFs, then the
mobile station shall perform an abnormal release with access retry
(sub-clause 8.8.3).

\- If the mobile station receives a PACKETÂ DOWNLINKÂ ASSIGNMENT, MULTIPLE
TBF DOWNLINKÂ ASSIGNMENT, PACKET TIMESLOT RECONFIGURE or MULTIPLE TBF
TIMESLOT RECONFIGURE message containing assignments such that more than
one radio bearer is mapped onto a TBF, then the mobile station shall
perform an abnormal release with access retry (see sub-clause 8.8.3).

\- If the PACKETÂ DOWNLINKÂ ASSIGNMENT, MULTIPLE TBF DOWNLINKÂ ASSIGNMENT,
PACKET TIMESLOT RECONFIGURE or MULTIPLE TBF TIMESLOT RECONFIGURE message
specifies a RB Id not assigned to the mobile station, then the mobile
station shall perform an abnormal release with access retry (sub-clause
8.8.3).

\- If a mobile station in MAC-DTM state receives a
PACKETÂ DOWNLINKÂ ASSIGNMENT, MULTIPLE TBF DOWNLINKÂ ASSIGNMENT, PACKET
TIMESLOT RECONFIGURE or MULTIPLE TBF TIMESLOT RECONFIGURE message
including the Frequency Parameters information element, the mobile
station shall perform an abnormal release with access retry (sub-clause
8.8.3).

\- If a failure in the PACKETÂ DOWNLINKÂ ASSIGNMENT, MULTIPLE TBF
DOWNLINKÂ ASSIGNMENT, PACKET TIMESLOT RECONFIGURE or MULTIPLE TBF
TIMESLOT RECONFIGURE message is due to any other reason, the mobile
station shall abort the procedure. If other uplink TBFs exist, the
mobile station shall perform an abnormal release with access retry
(sub-clause 8.8.3). If only downlink TBFs exist, the mobile station
shall continue the normal operation of these TBFs. If no other TBFs
exist, the mobile station shall perform an abnormal release without
retry (see sub-clause 8.8.2).

#### 8.2.2.2 Extended Dynamic Allocation uplink RLC data block transfer

##### 8.2.2.2.0 General

The Extended Dynamic Allocation medium access method extends the Dynamic
Allocation medium access method to allow higher uplink throughput.

This sub-clause defines the extensions to the Dynamic Allocation medium
access method. All procedures defined in sub-clause 8.2.2.1 apply,
except where this sub-clause defines a new procedure. In cases where
this sub-clause conflicts with sub-clause 8.2.2.1, this sub-clause takes
precedence.

##### 8.2.2.2.1 Uplink PDCH Allocation

#### 8.2.2.4 Network initiated release of uplink TBF

See 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.060 sub-clause 8.1.1.4.

#### 8.2.2.5 Abnormal cases

The following additional abnormal cases are applicable to an uplink
transfer:-

\- if the mobile station receives a PACKETÂ UPLINKÂ ACK/NACK message with
missing mandatory fields, the mobile station shall perform an abnormal
release with access retry of the uplink TBF (sub-clause 8.8.5)
associated with this message.

\- if the mobile station receives a PACKETÂ UPLINKÂ ACK/NACK message that
contains a RB Id that is not assigned to the mobile station or that is
assigned to the mobile station but without any corresponding uplink TBF,
the mobile station shall perform an abnormal release with access retry
(sub-clause 8.8.3).

### 8.2.3 Downlink RLC data block transfer

#### 8.2.3.1 General

##### 8.2.3.1.0 General

The network initiates assignment of a single downlink TBF by sending a
PACKETÂ DOWNLINKÂ ASSIGNMENT or a PACKET TIMESLOT RECONFIGURE message on
the downlink PACCH. The network initiates assignment of more than one
downlink TBF by sending a MULTIPLE TBFÂ DOWNLINKÂ ASSIGNMENT or a MULTIPLE
TBF TIMESLOT RECONFIGURE message on the downlink PACCH. Prior to the
initiation of RLC data block transfer on the downlink, the network
assigns the following parameters to the downlink TBF in the downlink
assignment message:

\- a Temporary Flow Identity (TFI). The TFI applies to all radio blocks
transferred in regards to the downlink Temporary Block Flow (TBF).

\- a radio bearer identity (RB Id). There is a one-to-one mapping
between the TFI and the RB Id of the radio bearer for which the downlink
TBF is established.

\- a set of PDCHs to be used for the downlink transfer;

\- optionally, a TBF starting time indication.

For each TBF, the network shall prioritise RLC/MAC control blocks, not
containing a PACKET DOWNLINK DUMMY CONTROL BLOCK message, to be
transmitted ahead of RLC data blocks for that TBF. If the network has no
other RLC/MAC block to transmit, but wishes to transmit on the downlink,
the network shall transmit an RLC/MAC control block containing a
PACKETÂ DOWNLINKÂ DUMMY CONTROL BLOCK message.

##### 8.2.3.1.1 Downlink resource reallocation

Neither the mobile station nor the network are allowed to modify the RLC
mode, TBF mode or radio bearer identity of an already established TBF.

If no modifications to the downlink resources are required, the network
may reallocate existing resources through one of the following
procedures:

\- The network may send a PACKET TIMESLOT RECONFIGURE or MULTIPLE TBF
TIMESLOT RECONFIGURE message to the mobile station on the PACCH to
reallocate downlink (and also uplink) resources, see sub-clause 8.2.3.2.

\- The network may send a PACKET DOWNLINK ASSIGNMENT or MULTIPLE TBF
DOWNLINK ASSIGNMENT message to the mobile station on the PACCH to
reallocate downlink resources, see sub-clause 8.2.3.2.

##### 8.2.3.1.2 (void)

#### 8.2.3.2 Downlink RLC data block transfer procedure

##### 8.2.3.2.0 General

Upon reception of a downlink assignment message (e.g.
PACKETÂ DOWNLINKÂ ASSIGNMENT, PACKET TIMESLOT RECONFIGURE, MULTIPLE TBF
DOWNLINK ASSIGNMENT, MULTIPLE TBF TIMESLOT RECONFIGURE) that does not
contain a TBF starting time the mobile station shall start timer T3190
for each downlink TBF assigned in the downlink assignment message and,
within the reaction time defined in 3GPPÂ TSÂ 45.010, it shall attempt to
decode every downlink block on its assigned SBPSCH(s). If the downlink
assignment message contains a TBF starting time information element and
there are no downlink TBFs in progress, but one or more uplink TBFs are
in progress, the mobile station shall remain on the assigned SBPSCHs
until the TDMA frame number indicated by the TBF starting time, at which
time the mobile station shall start timer T3190 for each downlink TBF
assigned in the downlink assignment message and immediately begin
decoding the assigned downlink SBPSCH(s).

If the downlink assignment message contains a TBF starting time and
there are one or more downlink TBFs already in progress, the mobile
station shall continue to use the parameters of the downlink TBFs in
progress until the TDMA frame number indicated in the TBF starting time
occurs, at which time the mobile station shall immediately begin to use
the new assigned downlink TBF parameters. If, while waiting for the
frame number indicated by the TBF starting time, the mobile station
receives another downlink assignment for the same TBF, the mobile
station shall act upon the most recently received downlink assignment
and shall ignore the previous downlink assignment. Procedures on receipt
of a downlink assignment message (e.g. PACKETÂ DOWNLINKÂ ASSIGNMENT
message) while no TBF is in progress are specified in sub-clause
sub-clause 7.3.2.1 and 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.060 sub-clause 7.2.1.1.

If the mobile station receives a valid RLC data block addressed to (one
of) its TBF(s), the mobile station shall restart timer T3190 for that
TBF. If timer T3190 expires for a TBF and if one or more uplink TBFs are
in progress, the mobile station shall perform an abnormal release with
access retry (see sub-clause 8.8.3, 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.060 sub-clause 8.7.2). If
no other TBFs are in progress, the mobile station shall perform an
abnormal release without retry (see sub-clause 8.7.1).

Upon receipt of a PACKET TBF RELEASE message referring to the downlink
TBF, the mobile station shall follow the procedure in sub-clause
8.2.3.6.

##### 8.2.3.2.1 Abnormal cases

The following abnormal cases apply:

\- If a mobile station receives a PACKET TIMESLOT RECONFIGURE, MULTIPLE
TBF TIMESLOT RECONFIGURE, PACKETÂ DOWNLINKÂ ASSIGNMENT or MULTIPLE TBF
DOWNLINKÂ ASSIGNMENT PACKETÂ DOWNLINKÂ ASSIGNMENT or PACKET TIMESLOT
RECONFIGURE message and detects an invalid Frequency Parameters
information element in the message, it shall perform an abnormal release
with system information (see sub-clause 8.8.4), performing a partial
acquisition of system information messages containing frequency
information.

> \- If the information in the PACKETÂ DOWNLINKÂ ASSIGNMENT or MULTIPLE
> TBF DOWNLINKÂ ASSIGNMENT message incorrectly specifies one or more
> downlink PDCHs, the mobile station shall perform an abnormal release
> of the downlink TBF(s) with erroneous assignments (see sub-clause
> 8.8.6). The mobile station shall act upon the valid assignments.
>
> \- If the information in the PACKET TIMESLOT RECONFIGURE or MULTIPLE
> TBF TIMESLOT RECONFIGURE message incorrectly specifies one or more
> uplink and/or downlink PDCHs, the mobile station shall perform an
> abnormal release of the downlink TBF(s) with erroneous assignments
> (see sub-clause 8.8.6). The mobile station shall act upon the valid
> assignments.
>
> \- If the information in the PACKETÂ DOWNLINKÂ ASSIGNMENT, MULTIPLE TBF
> DOWNLINKÂ ASSIGNMENT, PACKET TIMESLOT RECONFIGURE or MULTIPLE TBF
> TIMESLOT RECONFIGURE message violates the mobile station\'s multislot
> capabilities, the mobile station shall perform an abnormal release
> without retry (see sub-clause 8.8.2).

\- If a mobile station in MAC-DTM state receives a
PACKETÂ DOWNLINKÂ ASSIGNMENT or MULTIPLE TBF DOWNLINKÂ ASSIGNMENT message
including the Frequency Parameters information element, the mobile
station shall abort the procedure. If another TBF exists on a SBPSCH,
the mobile station shall continue the normal operation of these TBFs. If
no other TBF exists, the mobile station shall perform an abnormal
release without retry (see sub-clause 8.8.2).

\- If a mobile station in MAC-DTM state receives a PACKET TIMESLOT
RECONFIGURE or MULTIPLE TBF TIMESLOT RECONFIGURE message including the
Frequency Parameters information element, the mobile station shall
perform an abnormal release without retry (see sub-clause 8.8.2).

\- If one or more uplink TBFs are already established and the mobile
station receives a PACKETÂ DOWNLINKÂ ASSIGNMENT or MULTIPLE TBF
DOWNLINKÂ ASSIGNMENT message containing different frequency parameters
than are currently in effect for the uplink TBF(s), the mobile station
shall ignore the received message and continue normal operation of the
existing TBFs.

\- If a downlink TBF is not already established and the PACKET TIMESLOT
RECONFIGURE message does not include a DOWNLINK\_TFI\_ASSIGNMENT field,
then the mobile station shall perform an abnormal release without retry
(sub-clause 8.8.2).

\- If a downlink TBF is not already established and the MULTIPLE TBF
TIMESLOT RECONFIGURE message does not assign any downlink TBFs, then the
mobile station shall perform an abnormal release without retry
(sub-clause 8.8.2).

\- If the mobile station receives a PACKETÂ DOWNLINKÂ ASSIGNMENT, MULTIPLE
TBF DOWNLINKÂ ASSIGNMENT PACKET TIMESLOT RECONFIGURE or MULTIPLE TBF
TIMESLOT RECONFIGURE message containing assignments such that more than
one radio bearer is mapped onto a TBF, then the mobile station shall
perform an abnormal release without retry (see sub-clause 8.8.2).

\- If the PACKETÂ DOWNLINKÂ ASSIGNMENT, MULTIPLE TBF DOWNLINKÂ ASSIGNMENT,
PACKET TIMESLOT RECONFIGURE or MULTIPLE TBF TIMESLOT RECONFIGURE message
specifies an RB Id that is not assigned to the mobile station, then the
mobile station shall perform an abnormal release without retry
(sub-clause 8.8.2).

\- If the mobile station receives a PACKETÂ DOWNLINKÂ ASSIGNMENT, MULTIPLE
TBF DOWNLINKÂ ASSIGNMENT message so that the total amount of downlink
TBFs assigned to the mobile station (i.e. new and existing TBFs) is
larger than the maximum number of downlink TBFs the mobile station
supports, the mobile station shall ignore the message and continue
normal operation of the existing TBFs.

\- If the mobile station receives a PACKET TIMESLOT RECONFIGURE or
MULTIPLE TBF TIMESLOT RECONFIGURE message so that the total amount of
TBFs assigned to the mobile station (i.e. new and existing TBFs) in any
direction is larger than the maximum number of TBFs the mobile station
supports in any direction, the mobile station shall perform an abnormal
release with access retry (sub-clause 8.8.3).

\- If a failure in the PACKETÂ DOWNLINKÂ ASSIGNMENT, MULTIPLE TBF
DOWNLINKÂ ASSIGNMENT, PACKET TIMESLOT RECONFIGURE or MULTIPLE TBF
TIMESLOT RECONFIGURE message is due to any other reason, the mobile
station shall abort the procedure. If other uplink TBFs exist, the
mobile station shall perform an abnormal release with access retry
(sub-clause 8.8.3). If only downlink TBFs exist, the mobile station
shall continue the normal operation of these TBFs. If no other TBFs
exist, the mobile station shall perform an abnormal release without
retry (see sub-clause 8.8.2).

#### 8.2.3.3 Polling for Packet Downlink Ack/Nack

Whenever the mobile station receives an RLC data block addressed to (one
of) its TBF(s) with a valid RRBP field in the RLC data block header
(i.e. is polled), the mobile station may transmit one of the following
messages in the uplink radio block specified by the RRBP field whatever
the BSN value of the received RLC data block, according to the
subsequent decreasing order of priority:

1\) (EGPRS) PACKETÂ DOWNLINKÂ ACK/NACK message containing a Final Ack
Indicator,

2\) PACKET CELL CHANGE NOTIFICATION, if such a message is waiting to be
transmitted,

3\) (EGPRS) PACKETÂ DOWNLINKÂ ACK/NACK message containing a Channel
Request Description IE,

4\) any other RLC/MAC control message, if such a message is waiting to
be transmitted, other than a (EGPRS) PACKETÂ DOWNLINKÂ ACK/NACK,

5\) (EGPRS) PACKETÂ DOWNLINKÂ ACK/NACK message not containing a Final Ack
Indicator or a Channel Request Description IE.

However, the mobile station shall transmit an RLC/MAC control message
other than a (EGPRS) PACKETÂ DOWNLINKÂ ACK/NACK message at most every
second time it is polled for that TBF.

The mobile station shall not send a PACKET CONTROL ACKNOWLEDGEMENT
message unless otherwise specified.

In EGPRS TBF mode the mobile station shall react on a poll inside an
erroneously received RLC data block for which the header is correctly
received and which addresses the mobile station.

Whenever the network receives a valid RLC/MAC control message from the
TBF, it shall reset counter N3105. The network shall increment counter
N3105 for each radio block allocated to that TBF with the RRBP field,
for which no RLC/MAC control message is received. If N3105 = N3105max,
the network shall release the downlink TBF internally and start timer
T3195 for that TBF. When T3195 expires, the network may reuse the TFI*.*

The PACKETÂ DOWNLINKÂ ACK/NACK message contains a Channel Quality Report
(see 3GPPÂ TSÂ 45.008). The optional I\_LEVEL measurement results shall be
included in at least every other PACKETÂ DOWNLINKÂ ACK/NACK message.

The EGPRS PACKETÂ DOWNLINKÂ ACK/NACK message may contain an EGPRS Channel
Quality Report (see 3GPPÂ TSÂ 45.008).

In the case of simultaneous uplink and downlink TBFs, the transmission
of the polling response takes precedence over the transmission of
allocated uplink radio blocks.

A mobile station of multislot class 1 to 12 need not respond to the poll
if it is not compliant with the mobile station\'s multislot class (see
3GPPÂ TSÂ 45.002).

A mobile station of multislot class 13 to 18 shall always respond to the
poll.

NOTE: The mobile station is required to make neighbour cell measurements
while transmitting the polling response (see 3GPPÂ TSÂ 45.008).

#### 8.2.3.4 Resource Reassignment for downlink

The network initiates downlink resource reassignment by sending a
downlink assignment message (e.g. PACKETÂ DOWNLINKÂ ASSIGNMENT, PACKET
TIMESLOT RECONFIGURE, MULTIPLE TBF DOWNLINK ASSIGNMENT or MULTIPLE TBF
TIMESLOT RECONFIGURE) to the mobile station on the PACCH.

If the mobile station has a TBF for which T3192 is running, the network
may choose to reallocate this existing TBF and reuse the TFI value for
the new data by setting the Control Ack bit to \'1\' as specified in
3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.060 sub-clauses 9.3.2.6 and 9.3.3.5.

On receipt of a downlink assignment message and after the TBF starting
time, if present, the mobile station shall switch to the assigned
SBPSCHs. Upon switching to the new SBPSCHs the mobile station shall
restart timer T3190 for each newly assigned downlink TBF.

When the mobile station receives an RLC/MAC block addressed to (one of)
its TBF(s) on any of the new assigned resources it shall restart timer
T3190 for the TBF. If timer T3190 expires, the mobile station shall
perform an abnormal release without retry (see sub-clause 8.7.1).

#### 8.2.3.5 Establishment of uplink TBF

##### 8.2.3.5.0 General

The mobile station initiates the packet access procedure by sending the
Iu mode Channel Request Description information element in the (EGPRS)
PACKETÂ DOWNLINKÂ ACK/NACK message on the PACCH and starting timer T3168
for each TBF requested.

On receipt of an Iu mode Channel Request Description information element
in the (EGPRS) PACKETÂ DOWNLINKÂ ACK/NACK message, the network may assign
radio resources to the mobile station on one or more SBPSCHs by
transmitting an uplink assignment (e.g. PACKETÂ UPLINKÂ ASSIGNMENT, PACKET
TIMESLOT RECONFIGURE, MULTIPLE TBF UPLINK ASSIGNMENT or MULTIPLE TBF
TIMESLOT RECONFIGURE) message on the PACCH, or may reject the request by
sending a PACKET ACCESS REJECT message on the PACCH. If the PACKET
TIMESLOT RECONFIGURE message is sent, then the message shall contain the
UPLINK\_TFI\_ASSIGNMENT field.

A mobile allocation or reference frequency list, when received in the
Frequency Parameters IE, as part of an uplink assignment, replaces the
previous parameters and shall be used until a new assignment is received
or the mobile station has released all TBFs.

On receipt of an uplink assignment message the mobile station shall
follow the procedure below. On reception of an uplink assignment message
the mobile station shall stop timer T3168 for each TBF assigned in the
message.

The mobile station shall, after expiry of the TBF starting time, if
present, act upon the uplink assignment.

The mobile station shall then switch to the assigned uplink SBPSCHs and
begin to send RLC data blocks on the assigned SBPSCH(s). The G-RNTI
shall not be included in any of the uplink RLC data blocks.

On receipt of a PACKET ACCESS REJECT message that contains a Reject
structure addressed to the mobile station, the mobile station shall stop
timer T3168 for each TBF rejected in the PACKET ACCESS REJECT message
and indicate a packet access failure to the upper layer.

If the PACKET ACCESS REJECT message contains a WAIT\_INDICATION field in
a Reject structure addressed to the mobile station, the mobile station
shall start timer T3172 for each TBF rejected with the indicated value
(Wait Indication). The mobile station is not allowed to make a new
attempt for an uplink TBF establishment in the same cell until all
instances of timer T3172 expire, but it may attempt uplink TBF
establishment in another cell after successful cell reselection.

If timer T3168 expires for a TBF, the mobile station shall:

\- if the mobile station has no existing uplink TBF:

\- retransmit the Iu mode Channel Request Description information
element in the next (EGPRS) PACKETÂ DOWNLINKÂ ACK/NACK message unless the
Iu mode Channel Request Description has already been transmitted four
times for that TBF in which case the mobile station shall perform an
abnormal release with access retry (see sub-clause 8.8.3, 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.060
sub-clause 8.7.2).

\- if the mobile station has at least one uplink TBF:

\- proceed with uplink TBF establishment as defined in sub-clause
8.2.2.1.2.

If the downlink TBF is released, including expiry of timer T3192, before
expiry of timer T3168, the mobile station shall stop timer T3168 for
each TBF and perform an abnormal release with access retry (see
sub-clause 8.8.3, 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.060 sub-clause 8.7.2).

##### 8.2.3.5.1 Abnormal cases

In the following abnormal cases it is assumed that at least one downlink
TBF exists. The subsequent behaviour of the mobile station depends on
the type of failure and previous actions.

> \- If the information in the PACKETÂ UPLINKÂ ASSIGNMENT or MULTIPLE TBF
> UPLINKÂ ASSIGNMENT message incorrectly specifies one or more uplink
> PDCHs, the mobile station shall perform an abnormal release with
> access retry of the uplink TBF(s) with erroneous assignments (see
> sub-clause 8.8.5). The mobile station shall act upon the valid
> assignments.
>
> \- If the information in the PACKET TIMESLOT RECONFIGURE or MULTIPLE
> TBF TIMESLOT RECONFIGURE message incorrectly specifies one or more
> uplink and/or downlink PDCHs, the mobile station shall perform an
> abnormal release with access retry of the uplink TBF(s) with erroneous
> assignments (see sub-clause 8.8.5). The mobile station shall act upon
> the valid assignments.
>
> \- If the information in the PACKETÂ UPLINKÂ ASSIGNMENT, MULTIPLE TBF
> UPLINKÂ ASSIGNMENT, PACKET TIMESLOT RECONFIGURE or MULTIPLE TBF
> TIMESLOT RECONFIGURE message violates the mobile station\'s multislot
> capabilities, the mobile station shall perform an abnormal release
> with access retry (see sub-clause 8.8.3).

\- If the mobile station receives a PACKETÂ UPLINKÂ ASSIGNMENT or MULTIPLE
TBF UPLINKÂ ASSIGNMENT message containing different frequency parameters
than are currently in effect for its existing TBFs, the mobile station
shall ignore the PACKETÂ UPLINKÂ ASSIGNMENT or MULTIPLE TBF
UPLINKÂ ASSIGNMENT message, continue normal operation of the existing
TBFs, and reinitiate the establishment of the new uplink TBFs unless the
establishment of any of these TBFs has already been attempted four
times, in which case, the mobile station shall perform an abnormal
release with access retry (see sub-clause 8.8.3).

\- If a mobile station in MAC-DTM state receives a
PACKETÂ UPLINKÂ ASSIGNMENT or MULTIPLE TBF UPLINKÂ ASSIGNMENT message
including the Frequency Parameters information element, the mobile
station shall perform an abnormal release with access retry (see
sub-clause 8.8.3).

\- If an uplink TBF is not already established and the PACKET TIMESLOT
RECONFIGURE message does not include a UPLINK\_TFI\_ASSIGNMENT field,
then the mobile station shall perform an abnormal release with access
retry (sub-clause 8.8.3).

\- If an uplink TBF is not already established and the MULTIPLE TBF
TIMESLOT RECONFIGURE message does not assign any uplink TBFs, then the
mobile station shall perform an abnormal release with access retry
(sub-clause 8.8.3).

\- If the mobile station receives a PACKETÂ UPLINKÂ ASSIGNMENT, MULTIPLE
TBF UPLINKÂ ASSIGNMENT PACKET TIMESLOT RECONFIGURE or MULTIPLE TBF
TIMESLOT RECONFIGURE message contains assignments such that more than
one radio bearer is mapped onto a TBF, then the mobile station shall
perform an abnormal release with access retry (see sub-clause 8.8.3).

> \- If the MULTIPLE TBF UPLINKÂ ASSIGNMENT or MULTIPLE TBF TIMESLOT
> RECONFIGURE message does not specify a Channel Coding scheme for all
> of the uplink TBFs that it is assigning, then the mobile station shall
> perform an abnormal release with access retry of the uplink TBFs with
> erroneous assignments (see sub-clause 8.8.5). The mobile station shall
> act upon the valid assignments.

\- If the PACKETÂ UPLINKÂ ASSIGNMENT, MULTIPLE TBF UPLINKÂ ASSIGNMENT,
MULTIPLE TBF TIMESLOT RECONFIGURE message assigns the same USF to more
than one TBF on the same timeslot, then the mobile station shall perform
an abnormal release with access retry (sub-clause 8.8.3).

\- If the PACKETÂ UPLINKÂ ASSIGNMENT, MULTIPLE TBF UPLINKÂ ASSIGNMENT,
PACKET TIMESLOT RECONFIGURE, MULTIPLE TBF TIMESLOT RECONFIGURE message
specifies a RB Id that is not assigned to the mobile station, then the
mobile station shall perform an abnormal release with access retry
(sub-clause 8.8.3).

> \- If the PACKET ACCESS REJECT message does not specify a
> G-RNTI\_extension field in the Iu mode Reject structure for each
> G-RNTI included in the TLLI / G-RNTI field in the Reject structure,
> then the mobile station shall ignore the message.

\- If the PACKET ACCESS REJECT message includes one or more RB Id fields
in the Iu mode Reject structure which were not included by the mobile
station in the Iu mode Channel Request Description structure, then the
mobile station shall perform abnormal release with access retry (see
sub-clause 8.8.3).- If a mobile station in MAC-DTM state receives a
PACKET TIMESLOT RECONFIGURE or MULTIPLE TBF TIMESLOT RECONFIGURE message
including the Frequency Parameters information element, the mobile
station shall perform an abnormal release with access retry (see
sub-clause 8.8.3).

\- If a failure in the PACKETÂ UPLINKÂ ASSIGNMENT, MULTIPLE TBF
UPLINKÂ ASSIGNMENT, PACKET TIMESLOT RECONFIGURE or MULTIPLE TBF TIMESLOT
RECONFIGURE message is due to any other reason, the mobile station shall
perform an abnormal release with access retry (see sub-clause 8.8.3).

### 9.2.1 Dedicated allocation

#### 9.2.1.1 General

On DBPSCH, the transfer of RLC/MAC blocks is governed by the principles
of the dedicated allocation. Dedicated allocation is applicable to GPRS
TBF mode, EGPRS TBF mode, TCH TBF mode, DCCH TBF mode, UDCH TBF mode and
CDCH TBF mode. No other medium access mode shall apply for TCH TBF mode,
DCCH TBF mode, UDCH TBF mode and CDCH TBF mode.

A mobile station in dedicated allocation shall monitor the assigned
DBPSCH(s). The mobile station shall attempt to decode every downlink
RLC/MAC block on the assigned DBPSCH(s). Whenever the mobile station
receives an RLC/MAC block containing an RLC/MAC control block, the
mobile station shall attempt to interpret the message contained therein
and act upon it.

Except for TCH TBF mode in T-RLC mode, PACKET UPLINK DUMMY CONTROL
block(s) (respectively PACKET DOWNLINK DUMMY CONTROL block(s)) shall be
sent in periods when no RLC/MAC block is scheduled for transmission in
uplink direction (respectively downlink direction, following the
scheduling requirements defined in 3GPPÂ TSÂ 45.008). For TCH TBF mode and
UDCH TBF mode in T-RLC mode, DTX may apply.

#### 9.2.1.2 Performance requirements for TCH and DCCH TBF modes

When the mobile station receives a DBPSCH assignment, the mobile station
shall switch to the assigned DBPSCH(s) and be ready to transmit within
the reaction time defined in 3GPPÂ TSÂ 45.010.

The network (NW) and the mobile station (MS) shall follow the
performance requirements defined in the table below. These performance
requirements are given on a logical channel and MAC state basis, and
define the response time of the network and the mobile station upon
receipt of a request from the remote peer entity, where:

\- Trmin and Tresp denote respectively the minimum and maximum response
times following the reception of a given request, expressed in TDMA
frames, as follows:

\- if a polling request is received whose last burst has been physically
transmitted in the TDMA frame number FNcomm, then the first burst
carrying a segment of the corresponding response shall be physically
transmitted in the TDMA frame number FNresp where:

FNcomm + Trmin + 1 â¤ FNresp â¤ FNcomm + Tresp +1

\- following the mapping of logical channels onto physical channels and
the arithmetics on TDMA frame numbers specified in 3GPPÂ TSÂ 45.002.

#### 9.2.1.3 Performance requirements for UDCH and CDCH TBF modes

On a DBPSCH where FLO is used, the network (NW) and the mobile station
(MS) shall follow the performance requirements defined in the table
below. These performance requirements are given on a transport channel
and MAC state basis, and define the response time of the network and the
mobile station upon receipt of a request from the remote peer entity,
where:

\- Trmin and Tresp denote respectively the minimum and maximum response
times following the reception of a given request, expressed in TDMA
frames, as follows:

\- if a polling request is received whose last burst has been physically
transmitted in the TDMA frame number FNcomm, then the first burst
carrying a segment of the corresponding response shall be physically
transmitted in the TDMA frame number FNresp where:

FNcomm + Trmin + 1 â¤ FNresp â¤ FNcomm + Tresp +1

\- following the mapping of transport channels onto physical channels
and the arithmetics on TDMA frame numbers specified in 3GPPÂ TSÂ 45.002.

### 9.2.2 Transfer of RLC/MAC blocks on TCH

One and only one TBF in TCH TBF mode may be mapped onto a TCH.

No RLC/MAC control blocks shall be sent on TCH. RLC/MAC control blocks
belonging to a TBF in TCH TBF mode operating in NT-RLC mode shall be
sent on FACCH with Payload Type (PT) = \"10\". No RLC/MAC control block
shall be sent on FACCH if the corresponding TCH is occupied by a TBF
operating in T-RLC mode unless this RLC/MAC control block belongs to a
TBF in DCCH TBF mode mapped on this FACCH or carries a PHYSICAL
INFORMATION message. The HANDOVER ACCESS message shall be sent on FACCH
irrespective of the TBF mapped on TCH, following the rules defined in
sub-clause 9.2.3.

An RLC/MAC control block carrying a PHYSICAL INFORMATION message on
FACCH shall be sent with Payload Type (PT) = \"01\".

RLC/MAC blocks shall be transmitted with the following priority (highest
priority first):

\- RLC/MAC blocks on FACCH, except Packet Uplink/Downlink Dummy Control
Blocks;

\- RLC data blocks on TCH;

\- RLC/MAC control blocks on FACCH containing Packet Uplink/Downlink
Dummy Control Blocks.

### 9.2.3 Transfer of RLC/MAC blocks on FACCH, SACCH and SDCCH

A TBF associated with a URB may operate in DCCH TBF mode but shall not
be mapped on SACCH.

On SACCH, MAC shall ensure the following as long as there is data to
send for SRB1, and SRB3 and/or SRB4:

\- every second RLC/MAC block sent on SACCH shall belong to SRB1, and
the other to SRB3 or SRB4, and

\- every second RLC/MAC block belonging to SRB1 shall be discarded, the
other shall be sent on SACCH.

All RLC data blocks belonging to a TBF in DCCH TBF mode shall be encoded
using CS-1.

The mobile station shall attempt to decode every downlink RLC/MAC block
on FACCH, SACCH or SDCCH. Whenever the mobile station receives an
RLC/MAC block containing an RLC/MAC control block, the mobile station
shall attempt to interpret the message contained therein, and shall act
on it.

Each RLC data block sent on FACCH, SACCH or SDCCH shall contain a
Reduced Radio Bearer identity (RRBid) field corresponding to the radio
bearer to which the RLC data block belongs.

On SDCCH, all the RLC data blocks of an uplink TBF shall each contain a
G-RNTI field in the RLC data block header until contention resolution is
completed on the mobile station side (see sub-clause 7.2.3.3.2.3). After
the reaction time specified in 3GPPÂ TSÂ 45.010 no other RLC data blocks
shall contain a G-RNTI field, except for those retransmitted RLC data
blocks that originally contained a G-RNTI, which will be repeated
including the same G-RNTI.

RLC/MAC blocks and HANDOVER ACCESS message shall be transmitted with the
following priority (highest priority first):

\- HANDOVER ACCESS message

\- RLC/MAC control blocks with a Payload Type (PT) = \"01\" i.e. related
to a TBF in DCCH TBF mode or carrying a PHYSICAL INFORMATION message,
except Packet Uplink/Downlink Dummy Control blocks;

\- RLC data blocks containing a piggy-backed acknowledgement;

\- RLC/MAC control blocks with a Payload Type (PT) = \"10\" i.e. related
to a TBF in TCH TBF mode, except Packet Uplink/Downlink Dummy Control
blocks;

\- RLC data blocks not containing a piggy-backed acknowledgement;

\- RLC/MAC control blocks containing Packet Uplink/Downlink Dummy
Control Blocks.

### 9.2.4 Transfer of RLC/MAC blocks on PDTCH and PACCH

#### 9.2.4.1 General

##### 9.2.4.1.1 Downlink transfer

###### 9.2.4.1.1.1 General

RLC/MAC blocks shall be transmitted in the downlink with the following
priority (highest priority first):

\- RLC/MAC control blocks except Packet Downlink Dummy Control blocks;

\- RLC data blocks;

\- RLC/MAC control blocks containing Packet Downlink Dummy Control
Blocks.

If the network has no other RLC/MAC block to transmit, but wishes to
transmit on the downlink (e.g. to provide USF), the network shall
transmit an RLC/MAC control block containing a Packet Downlink Dummy
Control block.

###### 9.2.4.1.1.2 Polling for Packet Downlink Ack/Nack

Whenever the mobile station receives an RLC data block addressed to (one
of) its TBF(s) with a valid RRBP field in the RLC data block header
(i.e. is polled), the mobile station may transmit a (EGPRS) Packet
Downlink ACK/NACK message in the uplink radio block specified by the
RRBP field whatever the BSN value of the received RLC data block, unless
another RLC/MAC control message is waiting to be transmitted, in which
case the other RLC/MAC control message shall be sent. The mobile station
shall transmit an RLC/MAC control message other than a (EGPRS)
PACKETÂ DOWNLINKÂ ACK/NACK message at most every second time it is polled
for that TBF. Furthermore the mobile station shall not transmit an
RLC/MAC control message on this TBF other than a (EGPRS)
PACKETÂ DOWNLINKÂ ACK/NACK message if the (EGPRS) PACKETÂ DOWNLINKÂ ACK/NACK
message contains a Final Ack Indicator set to \'1\' and shall not start
T3192. The mobile station shall not send a PACKET CONTROL
ACKNOWLEDGEMENT message unless otherwise specified (see sub-clause
9.3).The mobile station shall not send the Iu mode channel request
description field in the (EGPRS) PACKET DOWNLINK ACK/NACK message.

In EGPRS TBF mode the mobile station shall react on a poll inside an
erroneously received RLC data block for which the header is correctly
received.

Whenever the network receives a valid RLC/MAC control message from the
TBF, it shall reset counter N3105. The network shall increment counter
N3105 for each radio block allocated to that TBF with the RRBP field,
for which no RLC/MAC control message is received. If N3105 = N3105max,
the network shall start timer T3195. When T3195 expires, the network
shall notify a link failure to the RRC layer.

The PACKETÂ DOWNLINKÂ ACK/NACK message contains a Channel Quality Report
(see 3GPPÂ TSÂ 45.008). The optional I\_LEVEL measurement results shall be
included in at least every other PACKETÂ DOWNLINKÂ ACK/NACK message.

The EGPRS PACKETÂ DOWNLINKÂ ACK/NACK message may contain an EGPRS Channel
Quality Report (see 3GPPÂ TSÂ 45.008).

In the case of simultaneous uplink and downlink TBFs, the transmission
of the polling response takes precedence over the transmission of
allocated uplink radio blocks.

A mobile station of multislot class 1 to 12 need not respond to the poll
if it is not compliant with the mobile station\'s multislot class (see
3GPPÂ TSÂ 45.002).

A mobile station of multislot class 13 to 18 shall always respond to the
poll.

##### 9.2.4.1.2 Uplink transfer

###### 9.2.4.1.2.1 General

RLC/MAC blocks and HANDOVER ACCESS message shall be transmitted with the
following priority (highest priority first):

\- HANDOVER ACCESS message

\- RLC/MAC control blocks except Packet Uplink Dummy Control blocks;

\- RLC data blocks;

> \- RLC/MAC control blocks containing Packet Uplink Dummy Control
> Blocks.

Uplink TBFs are scheduled with USF. USF is assigned as described in
sub-clause 9.2.4.1.2.2.

Whenever the mobile station detects an assigned USF value on an assigned
DBPSCH, the mobile station shall transmit either a single RLC/MAC block
or a sequence of four RLC/MAC blocks on the same DBPSCH and, in case
there are more DBPSCHs assigned in uplink than in downlink, also on all
higher numbered assigned DBPSCHs. The time relation between an uplink
block, which the mobile station shall use for transmission, and the
occurrence of the USF value is defined in 3GPPÂ TSÂ 45.002. The number of
RLC/MAC blocks to transmit is controlled by the USF\_GRANULARITY
parameter characterising the uplink TBF.

When the mobile station transmits an RLC/MAC block to the network, it
shall start timer T3180 for the uplink TBF on which the block was sent.
When the mobile station detects an assigned USF value on an assigned
DBPSCH for the TBF, the mobile station shall restart timer T3180. If
timer T3180 expires, the mobile station shall notify a link failure to
the RRC layer.

Whenever the network receives a valid RLC/MAC block from the TBF, it
shall reset counter N3101. The network shall increment counter N3101 for
each radio block, allocated to that TBF, for which no data is received.
If N3101 = N3101max, the network shall stop the scheduling of RLC/MAC
blocks from the TBF and start timer T3169. When T3169 expires, the
network shall notify a link failure to the RRC layer.

The mobile station shall attempt to decode every downlink RLC/MAC block
on all assigned DBPSCHs. Whenever the mobile station receives an RLC/MAC
block containing an RLC/MAC control block, the mobile station shall
attempt to interpret the message contained therein and act on the
message.

Whenever the mobile station detects an assigned USF value on any
assigned DBPSCH, the mobile station may transmit a PACCH block on the
same DBPSCH in the next block period (see 3GPPÂ TSÂ 45.002). The mobile
station shall not transmit an RLC data block in any uplink radio block
allocated via the polling mechanism (see 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.060 sub-clause
10.4.4).

In case there are more DBPSCHs assigned in uplink than in downlink, the
network shall transmit all PACCH messages on the DBPSCH carried on the
lowest numbered timeslot in the allocation.

###### 9.2.4.1.2.2 On receipt of a Packet Uplink Assignment message

The USF of a TBF belonging to a URB is initially assigned by RRC using
radio bearer control procedures (see 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.118). The USF of a TBF
belonging to a SRB is assigned by RLC/MAC.

The network may send a PACKET UPLINK ASSIGNMENT message to the mobile
station on the PACCH on DBPSCH addressing a particular TBF on DBPSCH
(identified in the Global\_TFI field) in order to:

\- assign a USF to this TBF only in case this TBF does not already have
any assigned USF and/or to

\- change one or more of the following parameters of this TBF: (EGPRS)
channel coding command field, resegment bit, BEP\_PERIOD2 field. All
other parameters may only be changed through radio bearer control
procedures (see 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.118)

The network shall include a valid RRBP field in the RLC/MAC control
block header and clear counter N3105.

In case the mobile station receives a PACKET UPLINK ASSIGNMENT message
on PACCH (DBPSCH) addressing a particular uplink TBF on DBPSCH
(identified in the Global\_TFI field), the mobile station shall only act
on the following fields:

\- USF granularity and USF value per timeslot fields in the message (see
3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.060) if the mobile station does not already have a USF
assigned to this TBF,

\- starting time (if included),

\- (EGPRS) Channel coding command,

\- Resegment bit (if included), and

\- BEP\_PERIOD2 field (if included) and ignore other fields.

When the mobile station receives an uplink assignment that does not
contain a TBF starting time, the mobile station shall begin to use the
newly assigned parameters immediately for this TBF. If a TBF starting
time information element is present the mobile station shall wait until
the starting time before beginning to use these parameters for this TBF.
If while waiting for the frame number indicated by the TBF starting time
the mobile station receives another uplink assignment for the same TBF,
the mobile station shall act upon the most recently received uplink
assignment and shall ignore the previous uplink assignment.

When the mobile station receives the PACKET UPLINK ASSIGNMENT message,
it shall transmit the PACKET CONTROL ACKNOWLEDGEMENT message in the
radio block indicated by the RRBP field.

If the network does not receive the PACKET CONTROL ACKNOWLEDGEMENT
message in the radio block indicated by the RRBP field, it shall
increment counter N3105 and retransmit the PACKETÂ UPLINKÂ ASSIGNMENT
message. If counter N3105 exceeds its limit, the network shall stop
scheduling new uplink resources for the TBF, stop sending the PACKET
UPLINK ASSIGNMENT message to the mobile station and start timer T3195.

When timer T3195 expires the network shall notify a link failure to the
RRC layer.

###### 9.2.4.1.2.3 Release of the USF

The network may initiate the release of the USF of a particular TBF by
sending a PACKET UPLINK ACK/NACK message with the Final Ack Indicator
set to \'1\'. The network shall include a valid RRBP field in the
RLC/MAC control block header and clear counter N3103. The release of the
USF, using this procedure, may be initiated at a point determined by the
network.

If the mobile station receives a PACKETÂ UPLINKÂ ACK/NACK message with the
Final Ack Indicator bit set to \'1\', it shall transmit a PACKET CONTROL
ACKNOWLEDGEMENT message in the radio block indicated by the RRBP field
and release the USF.

When the network receives the PACKET CONTROL ACKNOWLEDGEMENT message in
the radio block indicated by the RRBP field, it may reuse the USF
resource.

If the network does not receive the PACKET CONTROL ACKNOWLEDGEMENT
message in the radio block indicated by the RRBP field, it shall
increment counter N3103 and retransmit the PACKETÂ UPLINKÂ ACK/NACK
message. If counter N3103 exceeds its limit, the network shall stop
scheduling new uplink resources for the TBF, stop sending the PACKET
UPLINK ACK/NACK message to the mobile station and start timer T3169.

When timer T3169 expires the network shall notify a link failure to the
RRC layer.

#### 9.2.4.2 Scheduling an inactive TBF on a DBPSCH

When a previously inactive TBF (i.e. for which the latest transmitted CV
was equal to 0 and for which no USF is assigned) has data to send, the
mobile station shall send one RLC data block for this TBF the next time
the network schedules any of the mobile station\'s TBFs using the
assigned USFs. This TBF shall be considered inactive until a USF is
assigned to it. This RLC data block shall not be sent in a block that
has been reserved for sending a RLC/MAC control message via the RRBP
field. On sending a RLC data block on a radio block that has been stolen
by this mechanism, the mobile station start timer T3194 for the
associated radio bearer. The mobile station shall stop timer T3194 on
receipt of the USF for this radio bearer (see sub-clause 9.2.4.1.2.2).
The mobile station shall be able to steal further blocks from any of its
scheduled TBFs, provided that no more than one block is stolen for a
particular radio bearer during an interval defined by the duration of
timer T3194. On expiry of timer T3194 the mobile station shall restart
the timer unless it has expired four times, in which case the mobile
station shall notify a link failure to the RRC layer.

#### 9.2.4.3 Further USF handling

If the mobile station has more than one active TBF with data to send,
the mobile station shall send data for the TBF corresponding to the
received USF, with the exception given in sub-clause 9.2.4.2. If the
mobile station has no data to send for the scheduled TBF (i.e. no RLC
data block or no RLC/MAC control message other than PACKET UPLINK DUMMY
CONTROL BLOCK message), and if the MS has data to send for one or more
other TBFs mapped onto the same DBPSCH, the mobile station may send data
from one of these other TBFs.

If the mobile station has only one TBF with data to send, the mobile
station shall ignore the USF and shall transmit data for this TBF.

### 9.2.5 Transfer of RLC/MAC blocks on UDCH, CDCH and ADCH

#### 9.2.5.1 General

On the DBPSCH(s) where FLO is used, the transfer of RLC/MAC blocks on
transport channels shall follow the rules below:

\- RLC/MAC blocks for data transfer belonging to a SRB shall only be
sent on CDCH, with Payload Type = \'00\';

\- RLC/MAC blocks for data transfer belonging to a URB operating in
NT-RLC mode shall only be sent on UDCH, with Payload Type = \'01\';

\- RLC/MAC blocks for data transfer belonging to a URB operating in
T-RLC mode shall only be sent on UDCH. No RLC/MAC overhead is used (see
sub-clauses 12.8b.1.3 and 12.8b.2.3);

\- RLC/MAC blocks for control message transfer shall only be sent on
ADCH, with Payload Type = \'10\'.

RLC/MAC blocks shall be transmitted with the following priority (highest
priority first):

\- HANDOVER ACCESS message;

\- RLC/MAC blocks for control message transfer on ADCH, except Packet
Uplink/Downlink Dummy Control blocks;

\- RLC/MAC blocks for SRB data transfer on CDCH containing a
piggy-backed acknowledgement;

\- RLC/MAC blocks for SRB data transfer on CDCH not containing a
piggy-backed acknowledgement;

\- RLC/MAC blocks for URB data transfer on UDCH;

\- RLC/MAC blocks for control message transfer on ADCH containing Packet
Uplink/Downlink Dummy Control blocks.

In addition, on DBPSCH/H where FLO is used, the transfer of RLC/MAC
blocks on transport channels shall follow the rule below:

\- Every RLC/MAC block for data transfer belonging to a SRB shall be
sent twice in a row. The first and second transport blocks used for the
RLC/MAC block shall be sent with the signalling TFC.

\- Every RLC/MAC block for control message transfer shall be sent twice
in a row. The first and second transport blocks used for the RLC/MAC
block shall be sent with the signalling TFC. In case ciphering is used,
the RLC/MAC block shall only be ciphered with the parameters used with
the first transport block, in both transport blocks.

The mobile station shall attempt to decode every downlink RLC/MAC block
on DBPSCH. Whenever the mobile station receives an RLC/MAC block
containing an RLC/MAC control block, the mobile station shall attempt to
interpret the message contained therein, and shall act on it.

#### 9.2.5.2 Transport format combination (TFC) selection

##### 9.2.5.2.1 General requirements

On each DBPSCH where FLO is used, the MAC layer shall select a TF for
each TrCH within the TFS configured by RRC for each TrCH so that the
resulting TFC belongs to the TFCS configured by RRC.

For RLC/MAC block for data transfer belonging to a TBF in CDCH TBF mode,
the MAC layer shall always select the signalling TFC(s) specified in
3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.118.

For RLC/MAC block for data transfer belonging to a TBF in UDCH TBF mode,
the MAC layer shall select a TF within the TFS of the TrCH on which the
corresponding radio bearer is mapped. It shall not select a TF that does
not belong to this TFS.

For RLC/MAC block for control message transfer, the MAC layer shall
always select the signalling TFC specified in 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.118.

##### 9.2.5.2.2 Downlink

The selection of the TFC in the downlink is left up to network
implementation. The network shall follow the requirements defined in
sub-clause 9.2.5.2.1.

##### 9.2.5.2.3 Uplink

The mobile station shall be notified of the highest allowed TFC in the
TFCS, that may be used for uplink transmission. The mobile station shall
not select any TFC of which the TFCI is higher than the TFCI of the
highest allowed TFC. If no highest allowed TFC is notified to the mobile
station, the highest allowed TFC shall be the highest TFC in the TFCS.
All the TFCs up to and including the highest allowed TFC are valid TFCs.
All other TFCs are invalid.

Every TTI, the mobile station shall select a valid TFC as follows:

\- No other TFC shall allow the transmission of more highest priority
data than the selected TFC

\- No other TFC shall allow the transmission of more data from the next
lower priority TBF. This shall be applied for each TBF for the remaining
priority levels.

#### 9.2.5.3 Polling for PACKET DBPSCH DOWNLINK ACK/NACK TYPE 2

Upon receipt by the mobile station of a polling request within an
RLC/MAC block for data transfer, the mobile station shall send a PACKET
DBPSCH DOWNLINK ACK/NACK TYPE 2 message within the next possible uplink
occurrence on ADCH, following the requirements defined in sub-clause
9.2.1.3.

9.3 PACKET CONTROL ACKNOWLEDGEMENT
----------------------------------

Upon receipt by the mobile station of a polling request (see sub-clauses
12.7.4 and 12.9.3) within an RLC/MAC control message sent on a given
logical channel, the mobile station shall send a corresponding PACKET
CONTROL ACKNOWLEDGEMENT message within the next possible uplink
occurrence on the same logical channel or ADCH (FLO only). The PACKET
CONTROL ACKNOWLEDGEMENT message shall be formatted using the normal
burst format. The next possible uplink occurrence is defined following
the rules below:

\- If the RLC/MAC control message is received on PACCH with a valid RRBP
field as part of this RLC/MAC control message, the mobile station shall
transmit a PACKET CONTROL ACKNOWLEDGEMENT message in the uplink radio
block specified (see 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.060 sub-clause 10.4.5)

\- Otherwise, the mobile station shall send the PACKET CONTROL
ACKNOWLEDGEMENT message following the requirements defined in
sub-clauses 9.2.1.2 and 9.2.1.3, considering the PACKET CONTROL
ACKNOWLEDGEMENT message has higher priority than any other RLC/MAC
control messages, and any RLC data block. Upon reception by the network
of a PACKET CONTROL ACKNOWLEDGEMENT message that does not target a
specific RLC entity, within the requirements defined in sub-clauses
9.2.1.2 and 9.2.1.3, the network shall reset counter N3105. If the
network does not receive a PACKET CONTROL ACKNOWLEDGEMENT message before
the response time specified in sub-clauses 9.2.1.2 and 9.2.1.3, it shall
increment counter N3105. If counter N3105=N3105max, the network shall
indicate a link failure to the RRC layer.

9.3a Handover Access and Physical Information
---------------------------------------------

### 9.3a.1 Handover Access

During a handover, upon trigger from RRC through the HANDOVER-Req
primitive, the mobile station shall send a HANDOVER ACCESS message
containing the necessary handover reference value (see sub-clause 4.3.4)
to the network on either FACCH, PACCH (on DBPSCH), ADCH (FLO only) or
SDCCH. While the HANDOVER ACCESS message is being sent on FACCH, PACCH
(on DBPSCH) , ADCH (FLO only) or SDCCH, the mobile station may send
additional HANDOVER ACCESS messages on SACCH. In this case, the HANDOVER
ACCESS message may be sent on any TDMA frame block (Bn) belonging to the
allocated SACCH (see 3GPPÂ TSÂ 45.002). The mobile station shall not send
any HANDOVER ACCESS message on SACCH if no HANDOVER ACCESS message is
being sent on FACCH, PACCH, ADCH (FLO only) or SDCCH.

Upon reception of a HANDOVER ACCESS message by the network, the RRC
shall be notified through the HANDOVER-Ind primitive (see sub-clause
4.3.4) and the network shall then proceed as specified in
3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.118.

In case of non-synchronized cells (see 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.118), no other RLC/MAC
block than those containing the HANDOVER ACCESS message shall be sent by
the mobile station while the PHYSICAL INFORMATION message has not been
received by this mobile station.

### 9.3a.2 Physical Information

During a handover, upon trigger from RRC layer through the
PHYSICAL-INFO-Req primitive, the network shall send a PHYSICAL
INFORMATION message containing the necessary timing advance value (see
sub-clause 4.3.4) to the mobile station, on FACCH, PACCH (on DBPSCH) ,
ADCH (FLO only) or SDCCH. The PHYSICAL INFORMATION message shall be
ciphered if applicable i.e. if ciphering is started (see
3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.118).

Upon reception of a PHYSICAL INFORMATION message, the RRC shall be
notified through the PHYSICAL-INFO-Ind primitive and the mobile station
shall then proceed as specified in 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.118.

9.4 Abnormal cases
------------------

\- If the mobile station receives an RLC/MAC control message on a
logical channel where this RLC/MAC control message is not allowed (see
sub-clause 9.2.0), the mobile station shall ignore the message.

\- If the mobile station receives an acknowledgement message (PACKET
UPLINK ACK/NACK, PACKET DBPSCH UPLINK ACK/NACK, PACKET DBPSCH UPLINK
ACK/NACK TYPE 2) with missing mandatory fields, the mobile station shall
notify the RRC layer, which shall in turn re-establish all RLC entities
for the radio bearers currently established on the DBPSCH(s) and release
the DBPSCH(s), as specified in 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.118.

\- If the mobile station receives an acknowledgement message (PACKET
UPLINK ACK/NACK, PACKET DBPSCH UPLINK ACK/NACK, PACKET DBPSCH UPLINK
ACK/NACK TYPE 2) for a radio bearer that is either not established on
the DBPSCH(s) or for which no data has been sent in the direction of the
acknowledgement on the DBPSCH(s), the mobile station shall notify the
RRC layer, which shall in turn re-establish all RLC entities for the
radio bearers currently established on the DBPSCH(s) and release the
DBPSCH(s), as specified in 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.118.

RLC/MAC control blocks shall be collected at the receiver until all
RLC/MAC control blocks comprising an RLC/MAC control message have been
received.

In MAC-Idle state, the mobile station shall be capable of receiving
eight RLC/MAC control messages in parallel. If the mobile station
receives RLC/MAC control blocks containing part of a ninth RLC/MAC

discard the RLC/MAC control block of the oldest partially received
message.

In MAC-Shared state, MAC-Dedicated state or MAC-DTM state, the mobile
station shall be capable of receiving sixteen RLC/MAC control messages
in parallel. If the mobile station receives RLC/MAC control blocks
containing part of a seventeenth RLC/MAC control message while it still
has RLC/MAC control blocks for sixteen partially received RLC/MAC
control messages, the mobile station shall discard the RLC/MAC control
block of the oldest partially received message.

The mobile station shall start an instance of timer T3200 following the
receipt of an RLC/MAC control block whose RTI value does not correspond
to the RTI value of a partially received RLC/MAC control message or if
the RLC/MAC control blocks were received on different SBPSCHs
(respectively DBPSCHs). In non-DRX mode the duration of timer T3200
shall be four BS\_CV\_MAX block periods. In DRX mode the duration of
timer T3200 shall be four times the DRX period (see 3GPPÂ TSÂ 43.064).

On receipt of an RLC/MAC control block containing a segment of an
RLC/MAC control message such that the mobile station now has the
complete RLC/MAC control message, the mobile station shall stop the
corresponding instance of timer T3200.

If the mobile station discards a partially received RLC/MAC control
message while the corresponding instance of timer T3200 is running, the
mobile station shall stop the corresponding instance of timer T3200.

On expiry of an instance of timer T3200, the mobile station shall
discard and ignore all segments of the corresponding partially received
RLC/MAC control message.

Upon successful change of SBPSCH (respectively DBPSCH) allocation, the
mobile station shall discard all partially received RLC/MAC control
messages on SBPSCH (respectively DBPSCH) and stop the corresponding

See 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.060 sub-clause 9.3.1.

The countdown value that is included in each uplink RLC data block by
the mobile station shall correspond to the RLC instance to which the RLC
data block belongs. In case SFACCH is used, a TBF shall have a countdown
value for each of the RLC instances multiplexed onto the TBF.

### 10.4.3 Delayed release of downlink Temporary Block Flow

This procedure is applicable in MAC-Shared state and in MAC-DTM state,
on SBPSCH only. See 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.060 sub-clause 9.3.1a.

### 10.4.4 Extended uplink TBF mode

This procedure is applicable in MAC-Shared state and in MAC-DTM state,
on SBPSCH only.

See 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.060 sub-clause 9.3.1b.

### 10.4.5 Acknowledged mode operation

#### 10.4.5.1 General

See 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.060 sub-clause 9.3.2.0.

See 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.060 sub-clause 9.3.2.1.

#### 10.4.5.3 Establishment of Temporary Block Flow

The establishment of a TBF occurs as described in clause 7. RLC
functions related to the ARQ function shall not operate until RLC data
block transfer has been initiated.

If for a given radio bearer, the uplink TBF ended with an incompletely
transmitted upper layer PDU or any unacknowledged upper layer PDUs, the
mobile station shall begin transmission on the new TBF corresponding to

See 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.060 sub-clause 9.3.3.0.

#### 10.4.6.2 Establishment of Temporary Block Flow

If for a given radio bearer, the uplink TBF ended with an incompletely
transmitted upper layer PDU, the mobile station shall begin transmission
on the new TBF corresponding to this radio bearer with the last
incompletely transmitted upper layer PDU.

#### 10.4.6.3 Operation of uplink Temporary Block Flow

The network shall send PACKETÂ UPLINKÂ ACK/NACK messages when needed.

The mobile station shall set the Stall indicator (SI) bit to \'0\' in
all RLC data blocks of the TBF.

On SBPSCH, if the mobile station transmits the number of RLC data blocks
corresponding to the RLC window size (WS),without receiving a Packet
Ack/Nack message the mobile station shall start timer T3182 for the TBF.
Timer T3182 shall be stopped upon reception of a PACKETÂ UPLINKÂ ACK/NACK
message for this TBF. If timer T3182 expires, the mobile station shall
decrement counter N3102 by PAN\_DEC, and perform an abnormal release
with access retry (see sub-clause 8.7.2).

On SBPSCH, whenever the mobile station receives a PACKETÂ UPLINKÂ ACK/NACK
message, the mobile station shall increment N3102 by PAN\_INC, however
N3102 shall never exceed the value PAN\_MAX. Upon cell reselection the
mobile station shall set counter N3102 to the value PAN\_MAX. When N3102
â¤ 0 is reached, the mobile station shall perform an abnormal release
with cell re-selection (see sub-clause 9.4.2). If PAN\_DEC, PAN\_INC, or
PAN\_MAX are set to the value 0, counter N3102 shall be disabled.

On SBPSCH, a mobile station operating with an exclusive allocation shall
start or restart timer T3184 upon reception of a PACKETÂ UPLINKÂ ACK/NACK
message. If timer T3184 expires, the mobile station shall perform an
abnormal release with access retry (see sub-clause 9.4.1).

10.5 Abnormal release cases
---------------------------

### 10.5.1 Abnormal release with access retry

Abnormal release with access retry is described in sub-clause 8.8.3. It
is applicable in MAC-Shared state and in MACâDTM state, on SBPSCH only.

### 10.5.2 Abnormal release with cell reselection

Abnormal release with cell reselection is applicable in MAC-Shared state
only.

See 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.060 sub-clause 9.4.2.

10.6 Uplink TBF release in extended uplink TBF mode
---------------------------------------------------

This procedure is applicable in MAC-Shared state and in MAC-DTM state,
on SBPSCH only.

In the extended uplink TBF mode (see sub-clause 10.4.4), the network may
initiate the release an uplink TBF by sending a PACKET UPLINK ACK/NACK
message with the Final Ack Indicator set to \'1\'. The network shall
include a valid RRBP field in the RLC/MAC control block header and clear
counter N3103. The network may use the TBF Est field in the
PACKETÂ UPLINKÂ ACK/NACK message to allow the mobile station to request
the establishment of new TBF. The release of the uplink TBF, using this
procedure, may be initiated at a point determined by the network.

If the PACKETÂ UPLINKÂ ACK/NACK message has the Final Ack Indicator bit
set to \'1\' and the following conditions are fulfilled: TBF Est field
is set to \'1\'; the mobile station has new data to transmit; the mobile
station has no ongoing downlink TBF, the mobile station shall release
the TBF and may request the establishment of new TBF using one of the
following procedures:

\- If Control Ack Type parameter in System Information indicates
acknowledgement is access burst, the mobile station shall transmit the
PACKET CONTROL ACKNOWLEDGEMENT message with the Ctrl Ack bits set to
\'00\'. The mobile station shall start timer T3168 and continue to
monitor the PDCH used for transmitting the PACKET CONTROL
ACKNOWLEDGEMENT message. The mobile station shall stop timer T3168 upon
reception of the PACKETÂ UPLINKÂ ASSIGNMENT message including Single Block
Allocation structure or the PACKET ACCESS REJECT message. The mobile
station shall use the same procedures as are used for TBF establishment
using two phase access described in sub-clause 7.2.4 starting from the
point where the mobile station receives the PACKETÂ UPLINKÂ ASSIGNMENT
message including Single Block Allocation structure or the PACKET ACCESS
REJECT message.

\- If Control Ack Type parameter in System Information indicates
acknowledgement is RLC/MAC control block, the mobile station shall
transmit the PACKET RESOURCE REQUEST message and start timer T3168. The
mobile station shall use the same procedures as are used for TBF
establishment using two phase access described in sub-clause 7.2.4
starting from the point where the mobile station transmits the PACKET
RESOURCE REQUEST message.

If the PACKETÂ UPLINKÂ ACK/NACK message has the Final Ack Indicator bit
set to \'1\' and the mobile station does not initiate the establishment
of a new uplink TBF according to one of the procedures described above,
the mobile station shall transmit the PACKET CONTROL ACKNOWLEDGEMENT
message and release the TBF. If there is no ongoing downlink TBF, the
mobile station in MAC-Shared state shall return to respectively MAC-Idle
state; the mobile station in MAC-DTM state shall return to MAC-Dedicated
state. The DRX mode procedures shall be applied as specified in
sub-clause 5.4.1.8.

When the network receives the PACKET CONTROL ACKNOWLEDGEMENT message or
the PACKET RESOURCE REQUEST message in the radio block indicated by the
RRBP field, it may reuse the TFI and USF resources.

If the network receives the PACKET CONTROL ACKNOWLEDGEMENT message with
Ctrl Ack bits set to \'00\' or the PACKET RESOURCE REQUEST message in
the radio block indicated by the RRBP field and the network has set the
TBF Est field to \'1\' in the PACKETÂ UPLINKÂ ACK/NACK message, the
network shall follow one of the following procedures:

\- In case the mobile station requested the establishment of new TBF
with the PACKET CONTROL ACKNOWLEDGEMENT message, the network shall
respond to the mobile station with the PACKETÂ UPLINKÂ ASSIGNMENT message
including Single Block Allocation structure or the PACKET ACCESS REJECT
message on the same PDCH as the mobile station has sent the PACKET
CONTROL ACKNOWLEDGEMENT message. The G-RNTI shall be used to identify
the mobile station. The network shall use the same procedures as are
used for TBF establishment using two phase access described in
sub-clause 7.2.4 starting from the point where the network transmits the
PACKETÂ UPLINKÂ ASSIGNMENT message including Single Block Allocation
structure or the PACKET ACCESS REJECT message.

\- In case the mobile station requested the establishment of new TBF
with the PACKET RESOURCE REQUEST message, the network shall use the same
procedures as are used for TBF establishment using two phase access
described in sub-clause 7.2.4 starting from the point where the network
has received the PACKET RESOURCE REQUEST message. The G-RNTI shall be
used to identify the mobile station.

If the network does not receive the PACKET CONTROL ACKNOWLEDGEMENT
message or the PACKET RESOURCE REQUEST message in the radio block
indicated by the RRBP field, it shall increment counter N3103 and
retransmit the PACKETÂ UPLINKÂ ACK/NACK message. If counter N3103 exceeds
its limit, the network shall stop scheduling new uplink resources for
the TBF, stop sending the PACKET UPLINK ACK/NACK message to the mobile
station and start timer T3169.

When timer T3169 expires, the network may reuse the TFI and USF
resources.

If for a given radio bearer the uplink TBF was operating in RLC
acknowledged mode and there is an incompletely transmitted upper layer
PDU or an upper layer PDU, which is not fully acknowledged, it shall be
transmitted after establishing a new uplink TBF for this radio bearer.

11 Radio Link Control (RLC) procedures on TCH, FACCH, SACCH, SDCCH and CDCH
===========================================================================

11.1 General
------------

This sub-clause describes the RLC procedures in TCH TBF mode, DCCH TBF
mode and CDCH TBF mode applicable in MAC-Dedicated state and MAC-DTM
state. Unless explicitly stated otherwise, the procedures and parameters
in this sub-clause are not applicable in T-RLC mode.

In TCH TBF mode, the following definitions apply in NT-RLC mode only:

\- Sequence Number Space (SNS): 256.

\- Window Size (WS): 128.

In DCCH TBF mode and CDCH TBF mode, the following definitions apply:

\- Sequence Number Space (SNS): 16.

\- Window Size (WS): 8.

11.2 Procedures and parameters for peer-to-peer operation
---------------------------------------------------------

### 11.2.1 Send state variable V(S)

See 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.060 sub-clause 9.1.1.

### 11.2.2 Control send state variable V(CS)

See 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.060 sub-clause 9.1.1a.

### 11.2.3 Acknowledge state variable V(A)

See 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.060 sub-clause 9.1.2.

### 11.2.4 Acknowledge state array V(B)

In RLC acknowledged mode, each RLC endpoint transmitter shall have an
associated acknowledge state array (V(B)). V(B) is an array of SNS
elements indicating the acknowledgement status of WS previous RLC data
blocks. The array is indexed relative to the acknowledge state variable
V(A) modulo SNS. The values of V(B) shall be updated from the latest
values received from its peer in the received block bitmap (RBB) of
either the piggy-backed acknowledgement (DCCH TBF mode and CDCH TBF mode
only) or the Packet Ack/Nack message (DCCH TBF mode, CDCH TBF mode or
TCH TBF mode) (see sub-clauseÂ 11.2.10).

The transmitter shall transmit the oldest RLC data block whose
corresponding element in V(B) indexed relative to V(A) has the value
NACKED. As each RLC data block is transmitted the corresponding element
in V(B) is set to the value PENDING\_ACK.

If \[Â V(S)Â \<Â V(A)Â +Â WSÂ \]Â moduloÂ SNS and no RLC data blocks have a
corresponding element in V(B) with the value NACKED, the RLC data block
with BSN = V(S) shall be transmitted and the corresponding element in
V(B) shall be set to the value PENDING\_ACK. If there are no further RLC
data blocks available for transmission (i.e. the RLC data block with BSN
= V(S) does not exist), the sending side shall transmit the oldest RLC
data block whose corresponding element in V(B) has the value
PENDING\_ACK, then the next oldest block whose corresponding element in
V(B) has the value PENDING\_ACK, etc. If all RLC data blocks whose
corresponding element in V(B) has the value PENDING\_ACK have been
transmitted once, the process shall be repeated beginning with the
oldest RLC data block.

If V(S)Â =Â V(A)Â +Â WS modulo SNS (i.e. the transmit window is stalled),
the sending side shall transmit the oldest RLC data block whose
corresponding element in V(B) has the value PENDING\_ACK, then the next
oldest RLC data block whose corresponding element in V(B) has the value
PENDING\_ACK, etc. If all RLC data blocks whose corresponding element in
V(B) has the value PENDING\_ACK have been transmitted once, the process
shall be repeated beginning with the oldest RLC data block. This process
of transmitting the oldest RLC data blocks whose value in V(B) has the
value PENDING\_ACK shall continue, as long as equation \[V(S)=V(A)+WS\]
modulo SNS holds.

When an element in V(B) falls outside of the active transmit window,
i.e. \[Â V(A) â¤Â BSNÂ \<Â V(S)Â \]Â modulo SNS, the element shall be set to
the value INVALID.

If V(S)Â =Â V(A) and there is no RLC data block with BSNÂ =Â V(S) available,
the mobile station shall stop sending RLC data blocks. The mobile
station shall continue sending RLC data blocks when a RLC data block
with BSNÂ =Â V(S) is available.

### 11.2.5 Block sequence number BSN

#### 11.2.5.1 Block sequence number for TCH TBF mode

Each RLC data block contains a block sequence number (BSN) field that is
8 bits in length. At the time that an inâsequence RLC data block is
designated for transmission, the value of BSN is set equal to the value
of the send state variable V(S).

#### 11.2.5.2 Block sequence numer for DCCH TBF mode and CDCH TBF mode

Each RLC data block contains a block sequence number (BSN) field that is
4 bits in length. At the time that an inâsequence RLC data block is
designated for transmission, the value of BSN is set equal to the value
of the send state variable V(S).

### 11.2.6 Reduced block sequence number RBSN

See 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.060 sub-clause 9.1.4a.

### 11.2.7 Receive state variable V(R)

See 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.060 sub-clause 9.1.5.

### 11.2.8 Receive window state variable V(Q)

See 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.060 sub-clause 9.1.6.

### 11.2.9 Receive state array V(N)

See 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.060 sub-clause 9.1.7.1.

### 11.2.10 Starting sequence number (SSN) and received block bitmap (RBB)

The Ack/Nack description IE contains a starting sequence number (SSN)
and a received block bitmap (RBB). The Ack/Nack description IE is sent
by the RLC receiver in a Packet Ack/Nack message (TCH TBF mode, DCCH TBF
mode and CDCH TBF mode) or by piggy-backing within RLC data blocks (DCCH
TBF mode and CDCH TBF mode) and is received by the RLC transmitter. The
SSN and RBB are determined as defined in this sub-clause and transmitted
in both RLC acknowledged and RLC unacknowledged mode. The SSN and RBB
may be ignored by the RLC transmitter in unacknowledged mode.

The RBB is defined as a binary valued array of WS elements, where the
index of each element takes value 0,Â 1,Â 2,Â ...,Â WS-1 in the given order,
respectively. The BSN values specified in the RBB are interpreted by
subtracting the bit position in the bitmap from the starting sequence
number (SSN) modulo SNS.

A valid BSN value in the RBB is one that is in the range
\[Â V(A)Â â¤Â BSNÂ \<Â V(S)Â \]Â moduloÂ SNS.

These inequalities shall be interpreted in the following way:

BSN is valid if, and only if, \[Â BSNÂ -Â V(A)Â \]Â moduloÂ SNS
\<Â \[Â V(S)Â -Â V(A)Â \]Â moduloÂ SNS.

At the RLC transmitter:

\- For each bit in the RBB whose corresponding BSN value is within the
transmit window, if the bit contains the value \'1\', the corresponding
element in V(B) indexed relative to SSN shall be set to the value ACKED.
If the bit contains the value \'0\', the element in V(B) shall be set to
the value NACKED. A bit within the RBB whose corresponding BSN is not
within the transmit window, shall be ignored. If the bit contains the
value \'0\', the last burst of the corresponding RLC data block has been
physically transmitted in the TDMA frame number FNcomm, and the first
burst carrying a segment of the PACKET DBPSCH UPLINK ACK/NACK or PACKET
DBPSCH DOWNLINK ACK/NACK messages or of the piggy-backed acknowledgement
has been physically transmitted in the TDMA frame number FNresp where
FNresp \< FNcomm + Trmin +1 (i.e. the RLC data block was recently
(re)transmitted and thus can not be validly negatively acknowledged in
this particular acknowledgement), the element in V(B) shall not be
modified. See sub-clauses 9.2.1.2 and 9.2.1.3 for the definition of
Trmin.

At the RLC receiver:

\- The starting sequence number (SSN) is assigned the value of the
receive state variable V(R). The received block bitmap (RBB) is assigned
the WS elements whose indices, with incrementing order, correspond to
elements in the receive state array V(N) at the receiver whose indices,
with decrementing order, range backwards from \[Â V(R)Â âÂ 1Â \] to
\[Â V(R)Â âÂ WSÂ \]Â (moduloÂ SNS). For each bit in the bitmap, the bit is
assigned the value \'1\' if the corresponding element in V(N) indexed
relative to SSN has the value RECEIVED. The bit is assigned the value
\'0\' if the element in V(N) has the value INVALID.

\- When polled within a downlink RLC data block, the mobile station
shall acknowledge all the RLC data blocks that have been correctly
received up to and including the radio block where the mobile station is
polled.

\- As an implementation option, the mobile station may also acknowledge
as many as possible of the RLC data blocks that are correctly received
after the radio block where the mobile station is polled.

### 11.2.11 Window Size

#### 11.2.11.1 TCH

For TCH TBF mode, the window size (WS) shall be128.

#### 11.2.11.2 FACCH, SACCH, SDCCH and CDCH

For DCCH TBF mode and CDCH TBF mode, the window size (WS) shall be 8.

### 11.2.11a RLC buffer

See 3GPP TS 44.060 sub-clause 9.1.9.3.

### 11.2.12 Segmentation of upper layer PDUs into RLC data units

See 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.060 sub-clause 9.1.11.

Once an RLC data block has been transmitted over the physical link,
should it be necessary to re-transmit the RLC data block, it shall be
re-transmitted using the same channel coding scheme and BSN as it had in
the previous transmission.

NOTE: The only coding scheme available in DCCH TBF mode is CS-1 coding.

If so ordered by RRC for a given signalling radio bearer using RLC
acknowledged mode, in order to assure duplication avoidance at higher
layer, RLC shall guarantee that no more than three upper layer PDUs
shall be outstanding in the transmit window at any given time: there may
be at most three upper layer PDUs that are being transmitted i.e. that
have been segmented and for which the RLC PDUs are being transferred to
the receiving end.

If so ordered by RRC (CRLC-CONFIG-Req primitive), the RLC transmitter
may discard:

\- in RLC acknowledged mode, RLC SDU(s) not yet segmented into RLC PDUs.
The RLC transmitter shall notify the higher layer of all discarded RLC
SDUs, if indicated (RLC-AM-DATA-DiscardReq primitive).

\- in RLC unacknowledged mode, RLC SDU(s).

### 11.2.13 Re-assembly of upper layer PDUs from RLC data units

See 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.160 sub-clause 10.2.15:

The duration of timer T3200 shall be so that, if the last burst of the
RLC/MAC control block that triggered the start of timer T3200 has been
physically transmitted in the TDMA frame number FNcomm, then the first
burst carrying a segment of the RLC/MAC control block that triggered the
stop of timer T3200 shall at the latest be physically transmitted in the
TDMA frame number FNresp where:

FNresp = FNcomm + Trmax +1, with Trmax defined as shown in the table
below

11.3 Operation during RLC/MAC control message transfer
------------------------------------------------------

RLC/MAC control blocks shall be used to transport RLC/MAC control
messages. Segments of only one RLC/MAC control message shall be
transported per RLC/MAC control block.

RLC/MAC control blocks shall be sent at a higher priority than RLC data
blocks.

The receiving side shall determine the length of the RLC/MAC control
message contents by interpreting the RLC/MAC control block contents.

No general acknowledgement shall be made as part of the transfer of
RLC/MAC control blocks or RLC/MAC control messages. The receiver shall
not acknowledge an RLC/MAC control block except when it is polled by the
transmitter as indicated by the polling (P) bit in the MAC header of
this RLC/MAC control block. The receiver shall not acknowledge an
RLC/MAC control message except when the RLC/MAC procedures explicitly
specify an acknowledgement. Upon reception of a polling request, the
receiver shall respond following the rules defined in sub-clause 9.2.3
and the requirements defined in sub-clauses 9.2.1.2 and 9.2.1.3.

A RLC/MAC control block header, may contain a Radio Transaction
Identifier (RTI) field that is 2 bits in length and performs in effect a
modulo 4 count of the downlink RLC/MAC control messages sent on FACCH or
ADCH. The RTI field shall be used to group the RLC/MAC control blocks
that make up an RLC/MAC control message. The RTI field allows the
transmitting and receiving entities to distinguish between up to 4
RLC/MAC control messages in a single transmit direction therefore
allowing up to 4 parallel transactions per FACCH or ADCH.

The network shall not use the same RTI value at the same time on the
same FACCH for two separate RLC/MAC control messages. The network shall
transmit both segments of a segmented control message on the same FACCH.
When FLO is used on a given DBPSCH, the network shall not use the same
RTI value at the same time on this same DBPSCH for two separate RLC/MAC
control messages. The network shall transmit both segments of a
segmented control message on the same DBPSCH.

11.4 Operation during RLC data block transfer
---------------------------------------------

### 11.4.1 General

The RLC ARQ functions are applicable in NT-RLC mode only and support two
modes of operation: RLC acknowledged mode and RLC unacknowledged mode.
RLC acknowledged mode operation uses retransmission of RLC data blocks
to achieve high reliability. RLC unacknowledged mode operation does not
utilize retransmission of RLC data blocks. No ARQ function shall apply
in T-RLC mode.

A TBF may operate in either RLC acknowledged mode, RLC unacknowledged
mode or RLC transparent mode.

For a URB, the RLC mode of the corresponding TBF is set to either RLC
acknowledged mode, RLC unacknowledged mode or RLC transparent mode at
set-up of this particular URB by means of primitive exchange between RRC
and RLC (CRLC-CONFIG) (see 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.118).

For a SRB, the RLC mode of the corresponding TBF is set implicitly to
the proper RLC mode, according to the identity of this particular SRB as
follows:

\- SRB1: RLC unacknowledged mode.

\- SRB2, SRB3, SRB4: RLC acknowledged mode.

11.4.2 Acknowledged mode operation
----------------------------------

#### 11.4.2.1 General

The transfer of RLC data blocks in RLC acknowledged mode uses
retransmissions of RLC data blocks. The transmitting side numbers the
RLC data blocks via the block sequence number (BSN). The BSN is used for
retransmission and for reassembly. The receiving side sends
acknowledgement in order to request retransmission of RLC data blocks.
The operation in RLC acknowledged mode shall be as described in
sub-clause 11.2.

#### 11.4.2.2 On TCH

##### 11.4.2.2.1 General

In TCH TBF mode, the transfer of RLC data blocks in RLC acknowledged
mode is controlled by a selective type IÂ ARQ mechanism coupled with the
numbering of the RLC data blocks.

##### 11.4.2.2.2 Uplink

The selection of the proper channel coding scheme (E-TCH/F28.8,
E-TCH/F32.0 and E-TCH/F43.2) is controlled by the network and ordered by
RRC during radio bearer set-up and reconfiguration procedures (see
3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.118). The RLC/MAC block format used shall be the one
corresponding to this channel coding scheme (see sub-clause 12.8).

The network shall send PACKET DBPSCH UPLINK ACK/NACK messages on FACCH
when needed. The mobile station may poll the network for sending a
PACKET DBPSCH UPLINK ACK/NACK message by setting the polling (P) bit in
an uplink RLC data block. Upon reception by the network of a polling
request, the network shall send a PACKET DBPSCH UPLINK ACK/NACK message
for the corresponding RLC entity to the mobile station in the next
possible downlink radio block on FACCH following the rules described in
sub-clause 9.2.3 and the requirements defined in sub-clause 9.2.1.2.
Upon reception by the mobile station of a PACKET DBPSCH UPLINK ACK/NACK
message for this RLC entity, the mobile station shall reset counter
N3106. If the mobile station does not receive any PACKET DBPSCH UPLINK
ACK/NACK message for this RLC entity before the response time specified
in sub-clause 9.2.1.2, the mobile station shall increment counter N3106.
If counter N3106=N3106max, the mobile station shall indicate a link
failure to the RRC layer which in turn shall stop the corresponding RLC
entity (see sub-clause 14.3 and 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.118).

The mobile station shall indicate a transmit window stall condition when
V(S)=V(A) + WS. Upon detecting a transmit window stall condition the
mobile station shall set the Stall Indicator (SI) bit in all subsequent
uplink RLC data block until the stall condition ceases to exist.

Upon detecting the stall condition the mobile station shall also start
timer T3182. Timer T3182 shall be stopped upon reception of a PACKET
DBPSCH UPLINK ACK/NACK message that makes V(S)\<V(A)+WS. If timer T3182
expires, the mobile station shall notify a link failure to the RRC layer
which in turn shall stop the corresponding RLC entity (see sub-clause
14.3 and 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.118).

##### 11.4.2.2.3 Downlink

The mobile station receives RLC/MAC blocks for data transfer on TCH.

The selection of the proper channel coding scheme (E-TCH/F28.8,
E-TCH/F32.0 and E-TCH/F43.2) is controlled by the network and ordered by
RRC during radio bearer set-up and reconfiguration procedures (see
3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.118). The RLC/MAC block format used shall be the one
corresponding to this channel coding scheme (see sub-clause 12.8). The
network may poll the mobile station for sending a PACKET DBPSCH DOWNLINK
ACK/NACK message by setting the polling (P) bit in a downlink RLC data
block. Upon reception by the mobile station of a polling request, the
mobile station shall send a PACKET DBPSCH DOWNLINK ACK/NACK message to
the network for the corresponding RLC entity in the next possible uplink
radio block on FACCH following the rules described in sub-clause 9.2.3
and the requirements defined in sub-clause 9.2.1.2. Upon reception by
the network of a PACKET DBPSCH DOWNLINK ACK/NACK message for this RLC
entity, the network shall reset counter N3107. If the network does not
receive any PACKET DBPSCH DOWNLINK ACK/NACK message for this RLC entity
before the response time specified in sub-clause 9.2.1.2, the network
shall increment counter N3107. If counter N3107=N3107max, the network
shall indicate a link failure to the RRC layer which shall in turn stop
the corresponding RLC entity (see sub-clause 14.3 and 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.118).

#### 11.4.2.3 On FACCH, SACCH, SDCCH or CDCH

##### 11.4.2.3.1 General

In DCCH TBF mode and CDCH TBF mode, the transfer of RLC Data Blocks in
RLC acknowledged mode is controlled by a selective type I ARQ mechanism
coupled with the numbering of the RLC data blocks.

##### 11.4.2.3.2 Uplink

The mobile station shall transmit an RLC/MAC block in each assigned
uplink radio block following the rules described in sub-clause 9.2.3.
The network shall send acknowledgement when needed. The mobile station
may poll the network for sending an acknowledgement by setting the
polling (P) bit in an uplink RLC data block. Upon reception by the
network of a polling request, the network shall send an acknowledgement
(PACKET DBPSCH UPLINK ACK/NACK message, PACKET DBPSCH UPLINK ACK/NACK
TYPE 2 message or piggy-backed acknowledgement) to the mobile station
for the corresponding RLC entity in the next possible downlink radio
block following the rules defined in sub-clause 9.2.3 and the
requirements defined in sub-clause 9.2.1.2. Piggy-backing of
acknowledgement is possible following the rules below:

\- If on the corresponding logical channel or transport channel an RLC
data block is scheduled for transmission in the next radio block:

\- if this RLC data block is an initial transmission, the
acknowledgement shall be piggy-backed within this RLC data block;

\- if this RLC data block is a retransmission of an RLC data block
wherein an acknowledgement was initially piggy-backed, the
acknowledgement shall be piggy-backed within this retransmitted RLC data
block.

\- Otherwise a PACKET DBPSCH UPLINK ACK/NACK message or PACKET DBPSCH
UPLINK ACK/NACK TYPE 2 message shall be sent.

Upon reception by the mobile station of a acknowledgement for this RLC
entity, the mobile station shall reset counter N3106. If the mobile
station does not receive any acknowledgement for this RLC entity before
the response time specified in sub-clause 9.2.1.2, the mobile station
shall increment counter N3106. If N3106=N3106max, the mobile station
shall indicate a link failure to the RRC layer which in turn shall stop
the corresponding RLC entity (see sub-clause 14.3 and 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.118).

The mobile station shall indicate a transmit window stall condition when
V(S)Â =Â V(A)Â +Â WS. Upon detecting a transmit window stall condition, the
mobile station shall set the Stall indicator (SI) bit in all subsequent
uplink RLC data block until the stall condition ceases to exist.

Upon detecting the stall condition the mobile station shall also start
timer T3182. Timer T3182 shall be stopped upon reception of a
PACKETÂ DBPSCH UPLINKÂ ACK/NACK message or PACKET DBPSCH UPLINK ACK/NACK
TYPE 2 message that makes V(S) \< V(A) + WS. If timer T3182 expires, the
mobile station shall notify a link failure to the RRC layer which in
turn shall stop the corresponding RLC entity (see sub-clause 14.3 and
3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.118).

##### 11.4.2.3.3 Downlink

The mobile station shall be able to receive RLC/MAC blocks in RLC
acknowledged mode on FACCH, SACCH and SDCCH. The mobile station shall,
in the RLC/MAC header, identify the RRBid and decode the RLC data blocks
belonging to the corresponding radio bearer.

The network may poll the mobile station for sending an acknowledgement
by setting the polling (P) bit in a downlink RLC data block. Upon
reception by the mobile station of a polling request, the mobile station
shall send an acknowledgement (PACKET DBPSCH DOWNLINK ACK/NACK message
or PACKET DBPSCH DOWNLINK ACK/NACK TYPE 2 message or piggy-backed
acknowledgement) for the corresponding RLC entity to the network in the
next possible uplink radio block following the rules defined in
sub-clause 9.2.3 and the requirements defined in sub-clause 9.2.1.2.
Piggy-backing of acknowledgement is possible following the rules below:

\- If on the corresponding logical channel or transport channel an RLC
data block is scheduled for transmission in the next radio block:

\- if this RLC data block is an initial transmission, the
acknowledgement shall be piggy-backed within this RLC data block.

\- if this RLC data block is a retransmission of an RLC data block
wherein an acknowledgement was initially piggy-backed, the
acknowledgement shall be piggy-backed within this retransmitted RLC data
block.

\- Otherwise a PACKET DBPSCH DOWNLINK ACK/NACK message or PACKET DBPSCH
DOWNLINK ACK/NACK TYPE 2 message shall be sent.

Upon reception by the network of an acknowledgement for this RLC entity,
the network shall reset counter N3107. If the network does not receive
any acknowledgement for this RLC entity before the response time
specified in sub-clausesÂ 9.2.1.2 and 9.2.1.3, the network shall
increment counter N3107. If counter N3107=N3107max, the network shall
indicate a link failure to the RRC layer which shall in turn stop the
corresponding RLC entity (see sub-clause 14.3 and 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.118).

11.4.3 Unacknowledged mode operation
------------------------------------

#### 11.4.3.1 General

The transfer of RLC data blocks in RLC unacknowledged mode does not
include any retransmissions. The block sequence number (BSN) in the RLC
data block header is used to number the RLC data blocks for reassembly.
The operation in RLC unacknowledged mode shall be as described in
sub-clause 11.2.

#### 11.4.3.2 On TCH 

##### 11.4.3.2.1 Uplink

The network shall send acknowledgements when needed.

The mobile station shall set the Stall Indicator (SI) bit to \"0\" in
all RLC data blocks.

##### 11.4.3.2.2 (void)

#### 11.4.3.3 On FACCH, SACCH, SDCCH or CDCH

##### 11.4.3.3.1 Uplink

The network shall send acknowledgements when needed.

The mobile station shall set the Stall indicator (SI) bit to \'0\' in
all RLC data blocks.

##### 11.4.3.3.2 Downlink

The mobile station shall be able to receive RLC/MAC blocks in RLC
unacknowledged mode on FACCH, SACCH and SDCCH. The mobile station shall,
in the RLC/MAC header, identify the RRBid and decode the RLC data blocks
belonging to the corresponding radio bearer.

### 11.4.4 Transparent mode operation (TCH TBF mode only)

When operating in transparent mode, the RLC protocol has no
functionality. The incoming RLC SDUs are transferred to the MAC layer
without being altered. No upper layer protocol information is removed.
No RLC protocol information is added.

### 11a.2.9 Receive state array V(N)

See 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.060 sub-clause 9.1.7.1.

### 11a.2.10 Starting sequence number (SSN) and received block bitmap (RBB)

#### 11a.2.10.1 General

The Packet Ack/Nack message (PACKET DBPSCH UPLINK/DOWNLINK ACK/NACK TYPE
2 message) contains a starting sequence number (SSN) and a reported
bitmap. The Packet Ack/Nack message is sent by the RLC receiver and is
received by the RLC transmitter. The SSN and reported bitmap are
determined as defined in this sub-clause 11a.2.10 and transmitted in RLC
acknowledged mode.

The BSN values specified in the reported bitmap are interpreted by
substracting the bit position in the bitmap to the starting sequence
number (SSN), modulo SNS (where the bit in first position in the bitmap
has the bit position \'1\').

A valid BSN value in the reported bitmap is one that is in the range
\[Â V(A)Â â¤Â BSNÂ \<Â V(S)Â \]Â moduloÂ SNS. These inequalities shall be
interpreted in the following way: BSN is valid if, and only if,
\[BSNÂ -Â V(A)Â \]Â moduloÂ SNSÂ \<Â \[Â V(S)Â -Â V(A)Â \]Â moduloÂ SNS.

#### 11a.2.10.2 Polling

Upon reception of polling in uplink (respectively downlink) TBFs, the
network (respectively mobile station) may select any composition (first
partial bitmap or next partial bitmap) of the Packet Ack/Nack message to
send to the mobile station (respectively network).

#### 11a.2.10.3 Determination of SSN and generation of the reported bitmap

If the receiving side is the network, the network may select any SSN
within the receive window. If the receiving side is the mobile station,
SSN shall be determined as follows: let PBSN represent a partial bitmap
sequence number variable stored at the receiver which helps to determine
the SSN for the next partial bitmap to be transmitted. SSN and PBSN
shall be determined as follows.

First, a Full Received Bitmap (FRB) is built from the receive state
array V(N) by extracting the part between V(Q) and V(R) similar to the
GPRS case: it is assigned the elements whose indices in the receive
state array V(N) at the receiver range from \[V(Q)+Â 1\]Â to \[V(R)
-1\]Â (moduloÂ SNS). For each bit in the bitmap, the bit is assigned the
value \'1\' if the corresponding element in V(N) indexed relative to SSN
has the value RECEIVED. The bit is assigned the value \'0\' if the
element in V(N) has the value INVALID.

![](media/image7.wmf){width="4.413194444444445in" height="1.05in"}

Figure 11a.2.10.3.1: Representation of bitmaps and variables

From the FRB, a reported bitmap shall be generated. The FRB shall be
recalculated before each reported bitmap is generated. For uplink TBFs,
the network may transmit any reported bitmap size to the mobile station.
For downlink TBFs, the mobile station shall follow the rules given in
this sub-clause 11a.2.10.3. The reported bitmap is either uncompressed
or compressed.

If the compressed reported bitmap covers more RLC data blocks than the
uncompressed reported bitmap, the receiver shall send the compressed
reported bitmap, otherwise the receiver shall send the uncompressed
reported bitmap. If FRB can be reported uncompressed, the receiver shall
send the uncompressed reported bitmap without attempting compression
(see below). The compression algorithm is defined in 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.060
sub-clause 9.1.10.

Let N be the maximum possible size in bits of the uncompressed reported
bitmap in the acknowledgement message when no compressed bitmap is
included.

If \[V(R)-V(Q)\] mod SNS â¤Â N (i.e. FRB can be reported uncompressed),
then SSN=V(R) and the reported bitmap covers N RLC data blocks (with a
BSN smaller than SSN). PBSN shall then be set to V(Q). The reported
bitmap shall be uncompressed. The bits corresponding to RLC data blocks
that may fall outside the FRB shall be set to \'1\', except for V(Q)
which shall be set to \'0\'.

If \[V(R) -- V(Q)\] mod SNS \> N (i.e. FRB cannot be reported
uncompressed), the mobile station shall determine whether a first
partial bitmap or a next partial bitmap is transmitted, as follows:

\- If \[PBSN-V(Q)\] mod SNS \< WS and if \[V(R) -- (PBSN +
PBSN\_Threshold)\] mod SNS \< WS, then a next partial bitmap is sent.

\- Otherwise a first partial bitmap is sent.

NOTE: The PBSN\_Threshold value intends at identifying a limit for the
difference between PBSN and V(R) beyond which a next partial bitmap is
generated. Its value is MS implementation dependent.

If a first partial bitmap is determined, then SSN shall be set to the
last sequence number + 1 (mod SNS) for which the Ack/Nack status can be
indicated in the reported bitmap. The reported bitmap covers the RLC
data blocks having a BSN within the interval \[V(Q), SSN\[. PBSN shall
then be set to the last sequence number for which the Ack/Nack status
can be indicated in the reported bitmap i.e. SSN-1.

NOTE: The first partial bitmap may cover the entire FRB when compression
is used

If a next partial bitmap is determined, then

\- If \[V(R) - (PBSN + 1)\] mod SNS \> N then SSN shall be set to the
last sequence number + 1 (mod SNS) for which the Ack/Nack status can be
indicated in the reported bitmap and the reported bitmap covers the RLC
data blocks having a BSN within the interval \[PBSN+1, SSN-1\]. PBSN
shall then be set to the last sequence number for which the Ack/Nack
status can be indicated in the reported bitmap i.e. SSN-1.

\- If \[V(R) -- (PBSN+1)\] mod SNS â¤ N, then SSN = V(R) and the reported
bitmap covers as many RLC data blocks having a BSN smaller than the SSN
as can fit in the reported bitmap. PBSN shall then be set to V(Q).

NOTE: The next partial bitmap may cover the entire FRB when compression
is used

The beginning of window (BOW) bit shall be set to \'0\' when the
reported bitmap does not cover V(Q), and to \'1\' otherwise. The end of
window (EOW) bit shall be set to \'0\' when the reported bitmap does not
cover \[V(R)-1\], and to \'1\' otherwise.

If V(Q) equals V(R), then SSN shall be set to the value SSN = V(R), BOW
bit shall be set to the value \'1\', EOW shall be set to the value \'1\'
and the reported bitmap size shall equal 0 bits.

#### 11a.2.10.4 Interpretation of the bitmap

If a compressed bitmap is received, the bitmap shall first be
decompressed according to the one-dimensional run length coding
algorithm specified in 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.060 sub-clause 9.1.10. The
uncompressed bitmap shall be treated as follows:

The first bit in the uncompressed bitmap corresponds to the block SSN-1
(mod SNS). The second bit in the uncompressed bitmap corresponds to the
block SSN-2 (mod SNS), and so on.

If the BOW bit in the Packet Ack/Nack message has the value \'1\', then
the bitmap acknowledges all blocks between V(A) and the block
corresponding to V(Q)-1 (the block corresponding to V(Q) corresponds to
the first \'0\' starting from the end of the bitmap), and the
corresponding elements in V(B) shall be set to the value ACKED.

If the EOW bit in the Packet Ack/Nack message has the value \'1\', then
bitmap value \'0\' shall be assumed for all RLC blocks with a BSN value
higher than the last entry in the bitmap but less than V(S) (i.e. \[
V(R) - 1 \< BSN \< V(S)\] modulo SNS).

For each bit in the uncompressed bitmap whose corresponding BSN value is
within the transmit window, if the bit contains the value \'1\', the
corresponding element in V(B) indexed relative to SSN shall be set to
the value ACKED. If the bit contains the value \'0\', the element in
V(B) shall be set to the value NACKED. A bit within the uncompressed
bitmap whose corresponding BSN is not within the transmit window, shall
be ignored. If the bit contains the value \'0\', the last burst of the
corresponding RLC data block has been physically transmitted in the TDMA
frame number FNcomm, and the first burst carrying a segment of the
Packet Ack/Nack message has been physically transmitted in the TDMA
frame number FNresp where FNresp \< FNcomm + Trmin +1 (i.e. the RLC data
block was recently (re)transmitted and thus can not be validly
negatively acknowledged in this particular acknowledgement), the element
in V(B) shall not be modified. See sub-clause 9.2.1.3 for the definition
of Trmin.

### 11a.2.11 Window Size

The window size (WS) shall be 512 in RLC acknowledged mode.

The window size (WS) shall be 8 in RLC unacknowledged mode.

### 11a.2.11a RLC buffer

See 3GPP TS 44.060 sub-clause 9.1.9.3.

### 11a.2.12 Segmentation of upper layer PDUs into RLC data units

See 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.060 sub-clause 9.1.11.

Once an RLC data block has been transmitted over the physical link,
should it be necessary to re-transmit the RLC data block, it shall be
re-transmitted using the same payload and BSN as it had in the previous
transmission.

If so ordered by RRC (CRLC-CONFIG-Req primitive), the RLC transmitter
may discard:

\- in RLC acknowledged mode, RLC SDU(s) not yet segmented into RLC PDUs.
The RLC transmitter shall notify the higher layer of all discarded RLC
SDUs, if indicated (RLC-AM-DATA-DiscardReq primitive).

\- in RLC unacknowledged mode, RLC SDU(s).

### 11a.2.13 Re-assembly of upper layer PDUs from RLC data units

See 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.060 sub-clause 9.1.12.

### 11a.2.14 Segmentation of RLC/MAC control messages into RLC/MAC control blocks

See 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.060 sub-clause 9.1.12a.

### 11a.2.15 Re-assembly of RLC/MAC control messages from RLC/MAC control blocks

See 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.160 sub-clause 10.2.15:

The duration of timer T3200 shall be so that, if the last burst of the
RLC/MAC control block that triggered the start of timer T3200 has been
physically transmitted in the TDMA frame number FNcomm, then the first
burst carrying a segment of the RLC/MAC control block that triggered the
stop of timer T3200 shall at the latest be physically transmitted in the
TDMA frame number FNresp where:

FNresp = FNcomm + Trmax +1, with Trmax defined as shown in the table
below

Table 11.2.15.1: Maximum difference between two segments of the same
RLC/MAC control message

  ----------------------- -------------------

  ----------------------- -------------------

11a.3 Operation during RLC/MAC control message transfer
-------------------------------------------------------

RLC/MAC control blocks shall be used to transport RLC/MAC control
messages. Segments of only one RLC/MAC control message shall be
transported per RLC/MAC control block.

RLC/MAC control blocks shall be sent at a higher priority than RLC data
blocks.

RLC/MAC control blocks shall be sent on ADCH.

The receiving side shall determine the length of the RLC/MAC control
message contents by interpreting the RLC/MAC control block contents.

No general acknowledgement shall be made as part of the transfer of
RLC/MAC control blocks or RLC/MAC control messages. The receiver shall
not acknowledge an RLC/MAC control block except when it is polled by the
transmitter as indicated by the polling (P) bit in the MAC header of
this RLC/MAC control block. The receiver shall not acknowledge an
RLC/MAC control message except when the RLC/MAC procedures explicitly
specify an acknowledgement. Upon reception of a polling request, the
receiver shall respond following the rules defined in sub-clause 9.2.3
and the requirements defined in sub-clauses 9.2.1.2 and 9.2.1.3.

A RLC/MAC control block header, may contain a Radio Transaction
Identifier (RTI) field that is 2 bits in length and performs in effect a
modulo 4 count of the downlink RLC/MAC control messages sent on ADCH.
The RTI field shall be used to group the RLC/MAC control blocks that
make up an RLC/MAC control message. The RTI field allows the
transmitting and receiving entities to distinguish between up to 4
RLC/MAC control messages in a single transmit direction therefore
allowing up to 4 parallel transactions per ADCH.

The network shall not use the same RTI value at the same time on the
same DBPSCH for two separate RLC/MAC control messages. The network shall
transmit both segments of a segmented control message on the same
DBPSCH.

11a.4 Operation during RLC data block transfer
----------------------------------------------

### 11a.4.1 General

The RLC ARQ functions are applicable in NT-RLC mode only and support two
modes of operation: RLC acknowledged mode and RLC unacknowledged mode.
RLC acknowledged mode operation uses retransmission of RLC data blocks
to achieve high reliability. RLC unacknowledged mode operation does not
utilize retransmission of RLC data blocks. No ARQ function shall apply
in T-RLC mode.

A TBF may operate in either RLC acknowledged mode, RLC unacknowledged
mode or RLC transparent mode.

For a URB, the RLC mode of the corresponding TBF is set to either RLC
acknowledged mode, RLC unacknowledged mode or RLC transparent mode at
set-up of this particular URB by means of primitive exchange between RRC
and RLC (CRLC-CONFIG) (see 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.118).

11a.4.2 Acknowledged mode operation
-----------------------------------

#### 11a.4.2.1 General

The transfer of RLC data blocks in RLC acknowledged mode uses
retransmissions of RLC data blocks. The transmitting side numbers the
RLC data blocks via the block sequence number (BSN). The BSN is used for
retransmission and for reassembly. The receiving side sends
acknowledgement in order to request retransmission of RLC data blocks.
The operation in RLC acknowledged mode shall be as described in
sub-clause 11.2.

The transfer of RLC data blocks in RLC acknowledged mode is controlled
by a selective type IÂ ARQ mechanism coupled with the numbering of the
RLC data blocks.

#### 11a.4.2.2 Uplink

The selection of the transport format set is under control of the
network and ordered by RRC during radio bearer set-up and
reconfiguration procedures (see 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.118).

The network shall send PACKET DBPSCH UPLINK ACK/NACK TYPE 2 messages on
ADCH when needed. The mobile station may poll the network for sending a
PACKET DBPSCH UPLINK ACK/NACK TYPE 2 message by setting the polling (P)
bit in an uplink RLC data block. Upon reception by the network of a
polling request, the network shall send a PACKET DBPSCH UPLINK ACK/NACK
TYPE 2 message for the corresponding RLC entity to the mobile station in
the next possible downlink occurence following the rules described in
sub-clause 9.2.3 and the requirements defined in sub-clauses 9.2.1.2 and
9.2.1.3. Upon reception by the mobile station of a PACKET DBPSCH UPLINK
ACK/NACK TYPE 2 message for this RLC entity, the mobile station shall
reset counter N3106. If the mobile station does not receive any PACKET
DBPSCH UPLINK ACK/NACK TYPE 2 message for this RLC entity before the
response time specified in sub-clause 9.2.1.2, the mobile station shall
increment counter N3106. If counter N3106=N3106max, the mobile station
shall indicate a link failure to the RRC layer which in turn shall stop
the corresponding RLC entity (see sub-clause 14.3 and 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.118).

The mobile station shall indicate a transmit window stall condition when
V(S)=V(A) + WS. Upon detecting a transmit window stall condition the
mobile station shall set the Stall Indicator (SI) bit in all subsequent
uplink RLC data block until the stall condition ceases to exist.

Upon detecting the stall condition the mobile station shall also start
timer T3182. Timer T3182 shall be stopped upon reception of a PACKET
DBPSCH UPLINK ACK/NACK TYPE 2 message that makes V(S)\<V(A)+WS. If timer
T3182 expires, the mobile station shall notify a link failure to the RRC
layer which in turn shall stop the corresponding RLC entity (see
sub-clause 14.3 and 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.118).

#### 11a.4.2.3 Downlink

The mobile station receives RLC/MAC blocks for data transfer on UDCH.

The selection of the transport format set is controlled by the network
and ordered by RRC during radio bearer set-up and reconfiguration
procedures (see 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.118). The RLC/MAC block format used shall be
the one corresponding to the transport channel (UDCH, CDCH, ADCH) on
which it is sent (see sub-clause 12.8). The network may poll the mobile
station for sending a PACKET DBPSCH DOWNLINK ACK/NACK TYPE 2 message by
setting the polling (P) bit in a downlink RLC data block. Upon reception
by the mobile station of a polling request, the mobile station shall
send a PACKET DBPSCH DOWNLINK ACK/NACK TYPE 2 message to the network for
the corresponding RLC entity in the next possible uplink occurence on
ADCH following the rules described in sub-clause 9.2.3 and the
requirements defined in sub-clauses 9.2.1.2 and 9.2.1.3. Upon reception
by the network of a PACKET DBPSCH DOWNLINK ACK/NACK TYPE 2 message for
this RLC entity, the network shall reset counter N3107. If the network
does not receive any PACKET DBPSCH DOWNLINK ACK/NACK TYPE 2 message for
this RLC entity before the response time specified in sub-clause
9.2.1.2, the network shall increment counter N3107. If counter
N3107=N3107max, the network shall indicate a link failure to the RRC
layer which shall in turn stop the corresponding RLC entity (see
sub-clause 14.3 and 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.118).

11a.4.3 Unacknowledged mode operation
-------------------------------------

#### 11a.4.3.1 General

The transfer of RLC data blocks in RLC unacknowledged mode does not
include any retransmissions. The block sequence number (BSN) in the RLC
data block header is used to number the RLC data blocks for reassembly.
The operation in RLC unacknowledged mode shall be as described in
sub-clause 11.2.

##### 11a.4.3.2 Uplink

The network shall send acknowledgements when needed.

##### 11a.4.3.3.2 Downlink

The mobile station shall be able to receive RLC/MAC blocks in RLC
unacknowledged mode on UDCH. The mobile station shall, in the RLC/MAC
header, identify the TFI and decode the RLC data blocks belonging to the
corresponding radio bearer.

### 11a.4.4 Transparent mode operation

When operating in transparent mode, the RLC protocol has no
functionality. The incoming RLC SDUs are transferred to the MAC layer
without being altered. No upper layer protocol information is removed.
No RLC protocol information is added.

NOTE: The field mapping convention for EGPRS (see 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.060
sub-clause 10.0b.3.2) applies. According to that, in particular
regarding the TLLI/G-RNTI field, the *least significant octet* of the
TLLI/G-RNTI value shall be mapped on octet M+1 and the *most significant
octet* of the TLLI/G-RNTI value shall be mapped on octet M+4 of the
uplink EGPRS RLC data block.

12.7 RLC/MAC block formats on FACCH, SACCH, SDCCH and CDCH
----------------------------------------------------------

### 12.7.1 RLC/MAC block

The size of an RLC/MAC block on FACCH, SDCCH and CDCH is 23 octets. On
SACCH, it is 21 octets, due to a 2 octets physical layer header (see
3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.003). RLC/MAC blocks for FACCH and SDCCH, as well as SACCH
blocks (RLC/MAC block together with the 2 octet physical layer header)
shall always be encoded using the coding scheme CS-1 (see 3GPPÂ TSÂ 45.003
and 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.004). RLC/MAC blocks for CDCH shall always use the
signalling TFC as specified in 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.118.

An RLC/MAC block may be for either data or control message transfer.

### 12.9.3 Polling (P) bit

The polling bit indicates whether or not the transmitter is polling for
acknowledgement. With FLO, when included in an RLC/MAC block for data
transfer, it also allows the reporting of link quality measurements
along with the requested acknowledgement. It is encoded as shown in
tableÂ 12.9.3.1.

### 12.9.11 Segmentation (S) bit

The Segmentation bit indicates whether or not the RLC/MAC control block
is a segment of an RLC/MAC control message. It is encoded as shown in
table 12.9.11.1.

Table 12.9.11.1: Segmentation (S) bit

  ----- ----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Bit   S: Segmentation bit
  0     The RLC/MAC control block contains an entire RLC/MAC control message
  1     The RLC/MAC control block is a segment of an RLC/MAC control message
  ----- ----------------------------------------------------------------------

### 12.9.12 Reduced Block Sequence Number (RBSN) bit

The Reduced Block Sequence Number (RBSN) bit carries the sequence number
of the RLC/MAC control blocks. The RBSN bit is encoded as a binary
number with rangeÂ 0Â toÂ 1. The RBSN bit is present if and only if the S
bit is set (see sub-clause 12.9.11).

### 12.9.13 (void)

### 12.9.14 Radio Transaction Identifier (RTI) field

The Radio Transaction Identifier (RTI) field is used to group the
RLC/MAC control blocks that make up an RLC/MAC control message and
identifies the segmented control message sequence with which the RLC/MAC
control block is associated. The RTI field is 2 bits in length with
range 0 to 3. The RTI field is present if and only if the S bit is set
(see sub-clause 12.9.11). The RTI is unique on a given logical channel
in a given direction.

NOTE: An RTI value may be repeated in both directions on a given logical
channel (e.g. FACCH uplink and FACCH downlink), and across logical
channels (e.g.. FACCH and SACCH).

### 12.9.15 Block Sequence Number (BSN) field

The Block Sequence Number (BSN) field carries the sequence absolute
Block Sequence Number (BSN\') modulo Sequence Number Space (SNS) (16 in
DCCH TBF mode, 256 in TCH TBF mode (NT-RLC)) of each RLC data block
within the TBF.

In DCCH TBF mode and CDCH TBF mode, the BSN is 4 bits in length and is
encoded as a binary number with range 0 to 15.

In TCH TBF mode (NT-RLC), the BSN is 8 bits in length and is encoded as
a binary number with range 0 to 255.

In UDCH TBF mode, in RLC unacknowledged mode, the BSN is 4 bits in
length and is encoded as a binary number with range 0 to 15.

In UDCH TBF mode, in RLC acknowledged mode, the BSN is 10 bits in length
and is encoded as a binary number with range 0 to 1023.

### 12.9.16 Radio Bearer Identity (RB Id) field

The Rb Id uniquely identifies a Radio Bearer. This field is encoded as a
binary number with range 0-31.

### 12.9.17 Signalling Radio Bearer Identity (SRB Id) field

The Signalling Radio Bearer Identity (SRB Id) field is used to identify
the SRB to which the RLC data block belongs. It is encoded as shown in
table 12.9.17.1.

Table 12.9.17.1: Signalling Radio Bearer Identity (SRB Id) field

+-----+------------------------------------------+
| Bit | SRB Id: Signalling Radio Bearer Identity |

### 12.9.18 GERAN Radio Network Temporary Identity Extension (G-RNTI Extension) field

This field contains the extra 4 bits of the G-RNTI not included in the
TLLI / G-RNTI field.

### 12.9.19 Length Indicator (LI) field

In GPRS TBF mode, EGPRS TBF mode, TCH TBF mode, DCCH TBF mode and CDCH
TBF mode, the Length Indicator bit is used as is described in
3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.060 sub-clauses 10.4.14 and 10.4.14a.

In UDCH TBF mode, the Length Indicator is used as described in
3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.060 sub-clauses 10.4.14 and 10.4.14a, with the following
exceptions:

\- The Length Indicator field is 8 bits in length and shall be encoded
as a binary number.

\- The valid values are the values ranging from 0 to 171, and the value
255. All other values are reserved.

\- An 8-bit Length Indicator of value 255 shall be treated as described
in 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.060 for a 7-bit Length Indicator of value 127

\- An 8-bit Length Indicator of value 127 shall be treated as a length
indication of 127 octets, and not as a 7-bit Length Indicator of value
127

The interpretation of the value contained in the length indicator with
corresponding E bit in UDCH TBF mode is summarized in tableÂ 12.9.19.1.

### 12.9.20 PFI Indicator (PI) field

The PFI Indicator is not used in *Iu mode*.

### 12.9.21 HFN Least Significant Bit (HFN\_LSB) field

The HFN Least Significant Bit (HFN\_LSB) field contains the least
significant bit of the HFN of the radio bearer to which the RLC/MAC
block belongs, in the direction where this RLC/MAC block is sent.

13 Ciphering
============

13.1 General
------------

The ciphering function is performed either in the RLC sublayer or in the
MAC sublayer according to the following rules:

\- The RLC sublayer is responsible for ciphering/deciphering RLC data
blocks in case of non-transparent RLC mode (unacknowledged or
acknowledged).

\- The MAC sublayer is responsible for ciphering/deciphering user data
in case of transparent RLC mode. It is also responsible for
ciphering/deciphering some RLC/MAC control messages.

The ciphering function shall use the ciphering algorithm f8 specified in
3GPPÂ TSÂ 35.201. Four input parameters are necessary to configure the
ciphering algorithm:

\- *Ciphering key*: the 128-bit *ciphering key* is received from RRC by
means of interlayer primitive.

\- *Bearer*: the 5-bit *bearer* indicates, when available, the radio
bearer identity of the radio bearer to cipher. It is received from RRC
by means of interlayer primitive.

\- *Direction*: the 1-bit *direction* indicates the direction of
transmission, uplink or downlink, of the flow to cipher.

\- *Count*: the 32-bit *count* is used to ensure that the blocks of a
same flow are all ciphered differently.

A fifth parameter, *Length*, is used to indicate the length in bits of
the plain data to cipher. Plain, ciphered and deciphered data are of the
same length. Length is not input to the ciphering algorithm.

13.2 Applicability of ciphering
-------------------------------

Ciphering may apply only between the mobile station and the serving BSS
when contention resolution is successfully completed, i.e. uplink data
(respectively downlink data) between the mobile station and the serving
BSS may be ciphered after contention is successfully completed on mobile
station side (respectively serving BSS side).

13.3 Ciphering at RLC sublayer
------------------------------

### 13.3.1 General

The RLC sublayer is responsible for ciphering/deciphering RLC data
blocks in case of non-transparent RLC mode (unacknowledged or
acknowledged).

For a given radio bearer, ciphering/deciphering is ordered by RRC by
means of the CRLC-CONFIG-Req primitive containing the necessary
ciphering elements (see sub-clause 4.3.3). Upon receipt of the
CRLC-CONFIG-Req primitive containing the ciphering elements, ciphering
shall be performed at RLC sublayer according to these ciphering elements
for the corresponding radio bearer. Ciphering shall not be performed at
RLC sublayer otherwise.

### 13.3.2 Parameter settings

#### 13.3.2.1 Input parameters to the ciphering algorithm

Table 13.3.2.1.1 defines how to set the input parameters to the
ciphering algorithm.

#### 13.3.2.2 Handling of the HFN

The HFN is radio bearer specific.

In RLC acknowledged mode, the HFN used at retransmission of an RLC data
block shall be the same as the one used at original transmission of this
RLC data block.

The HFN shall be increased by one at every cycle of the BSN, when the
BSN reaches 0.

Further handling of the HFN is described in 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.118.

### 13.3.3 Ciphering of RLC PDUs in non-transparent RLC mode

Ciphering may only apply on the payload of the RLC PDUs. For instance,
if MCS-9 is used, only the 592 bits of the payload of each of the two
RLC data blocks in the RLC/MAC block may be ciphered.

13.4 Ciphering at MAC sublayer
------------------------------

### 13.4.1 General

The MAC sublayer is responsible for ciphering/deciphering user data in
case of transparent RLC mode. It is also responsible for ciphering some
RLC/MAC control messages.

For a given radio bearer, ciphering/deciphering is ordered by RRC by
means of the CMAC-CONFIG-Req primitive containing the necessary
ciphering elements (see sub-clause 4.3.4). Upon receipt of the
CMAC-CONFIG-Req primitive containing the ciphering elements,
ciphering/deciphering shall be performed at MAC sublayer according to
these ciphering elements for the corresponding radio bearer. Ciphering
shall not be performed at MAC sublayer otherwise.

### 13.4.2 Parameter settings

#### 13.4.2.1 Input parameters to the ciphering algorithm

Table 13.4.2.1.1 defines how to set the input parameters to the
ciphering algorithm in case of transparent RLC mode.

Figure 13.4.2.1.1: 17-bit TDMA Frame Number

T1\' (6 bits) range 0 to 63 = T1 mod 64.

T2 (5 bits) range 0 to 25 = FN mod 26 as defined in 3GPPÂ TSÂ 45.002.

T3 (6 bits) range 0 to 50 = FN mod 51 as defined in 3GPPÂ TSÂ 45.002.

where

T1 = FN div (26 x 51) as defined in 3GPPÂ TSÂ 45.002.

and

FN = TDMA frame number as defined in 3GPPÂ TSÂ 45.002.

#### 13.4.2.2 Handling of the HFN

##### 13.4.2.2.1 Ciphering in transparent RLC mode

The HFN is radio bearer specific. It shall obey the following rules for
the lifetime of the corresponding radio bearer:

\- It shall be incremented by 1 every time the TDMA Frame Number is
smaller than the previous one.

\- It shall also be incremented by 1 at every cell change.

Further handling of the HFN is described in 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.118.

##### 13.4.2.2.2 Ciphering of RLC/MAC control messages

The HFN presented in table 13.3 shall obey the following rules:

\- It shall be reset to START value every time a new authentication is
made.

\- During an RRC connection:

\- It shall be incremented by 1 every time the TDMA Frame Number is
smaller than the previous one.

### 13.4.4 Ciphering of RLC PDUs in transparent RLC mode

Ciphering applies on the complete RLC PDUs.

14 RLC suspension, stop and re-establishment procedures
=======================================================

14.1 General
------------

This sub-clause describes the following RLC procedures: suspend/resume,
stop/continue and re-establishment. These procedures are requested by
RRC (see 3GPPÂ TSÂ 44.118), and are applicable in NT-RLC only.
Suspend/resume is used when e.g. ciphering parameters are changed.
Stop/continue and re-establishment are used during e.g. RB
reconfiguration.

14.2 Local suspend/resume function (NT-RLC)
-------------------------------------------

The upper layers may suspend/resume a RLC entity. Suspension of a RLC
entity is ordered through the CRLCâSUSPEND-Req primitive (see sub-clause
4.3.3). Resumption is ordered through the CRLC-RESUME-Req primitive (see
sub-clause 4.3.3).

When a RLC entity operating in unacknowledged mode is suspended by upper
layers with the parameter N, the RLC entity shall:

\- acknowledge the suspend request through the CRLC-SUSPEND-Conf
primitive containing the current value of the send-state variable V(S);

\- not send any RLC data block with a \"Block Sequence Number\"
BSNâ¥(V(S)+N) modulo SNS;

\- send Packet Uplink/Downlink Dummy control blocks on allocated radio
resources if there is no other RLC/MAC control message to be sent.

When a RLC entity operating in acknowledged mode is suspended by upper
layers with the parameter N, the RLC entity shall:

\- acknowledge the suspend request through the CRLC-SUSPEND-Conf
primitive containing the current value of the send-state variable V(S);

\- not send any RLC data block with \"Block Sequence Number\" BSN â¥
(V(S) + N) modulo SNS;

\- proceed with retransmission procedures for RLC data blocks with BSN
\< (V(S) + N) modulo SNS as defined in sub-clauses 10.4.5 and 11.4.2;

\- send Packet Uplink/Downlink Dummy control blocks on allocated radio
resources if there is no other RLC/MAC control message or RLC data block
to be sent.

When a RLC entity operating in unacknowledged mode is resumed by upper
layers, the RLC entity shall:

\- resume data transfer procedure.

When a RLC entity operating in acknowledged mode is resumed by upper
layers, the RLC entity shall:

\- resume data transfer procedure.

14.3 Stop/continue function (NT-RLC)
------------------------------------

The RLC stop/continue procedure is applicable on DBPSCHs only.

The upper layer may stop/continue a RLC entity. Stop of a RLC entity is
ordered through the CRLC-CONFIG-Req primitive (see sub-clause 4.3.3).
Continuation of a RLC entity is ordered through the CRLC-CONFIG-Req
primitive (see sub-clause 4.3.3).

When a uplink RLC entity is stopped, the mobile station shall pause the
timers T3180 and T3182 if running. When a downlink RLC entity is
stopped, the mobile station shall pause timer T3190 if running.

When an uplink RLC entity is continued, the mobile station shall
continue the timers T3180 and T3182 if paused. When a downlink RLC
entity is continued, the mobile station shall start timer T3190 if
paused.

When a RLC entity is stopped by upper layers, the RLC entity shall:

\- not submit any RLC data blocks to lower layer or accept any RLC data
blocks;

\- not submit any RLC/MAC control message to lower layer or accept any
RLC/MAC control message;

\- save all state variables.

When a RLC entity is continued by upper layers, the RLC entity shall:

\- if the RLC entity is stopped:

> \- continue the data transmission and reception from the stored state
> variables.

\- otherwise, if the RLC is not stopped:

\- take no action.

14.4 RLC re-establishment function (NT-RLC)
-------------------------------------------

The RLC re-establishment function is applicable in NT-RLC only, on
DBPSCHs only.

The upper layers may re-establish a RLC entity. Re-establishment of a
RLC entity is ordered through the RLC-CONFIG-Req primitive (see
sub-clause 4.3.3).

When a RLC entity is re-established by upper layers, the RLC entity
shall:

\- reset the state variables to their initial value;

\- set the configurable parameters (e.g. EGPRS RLC window size) to their
configured value;

\- set the hyper frame number (HFN) in UL and DL to the value configured
by upper layers;

\- if the RLC entity is operating in unacknowledged mode:

\- if it is a receiving RLC entity:

\- discard all RLC data blocks (PDUs).

\- if it is a transmitting RLC entity:

\- discard the RLC SDUs for which one or more segments have been
submitted to the MAC layer.

\- otherwise if the RLC entity is operating in acknowledged mode:

\- discard all RLC data blocks (PDUs) and RLC/MAC control messages for
this RLC entity.
