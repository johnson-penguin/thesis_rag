4 Generic procedures for the control of location services
=========================================================

4.1 Overview of the generic protocol and its scope
--------------------------------------------------

One generic protocol is defined for the control of location services at
the radio interface. This protocol operates at layerÂ 3 of the radio
interface and assumes the use of layers 1 and 2 conform to 3GPP TS
45â€‘series and 3GPP TSÂ 44.004, 3GPP TSÂ 44.005 and 3GPP TS 44.006. The
generic protocol uses the acknowledged information transfer service
available at the layer 2 â€‘ layer 3 interface.

The Functional protocol is based on the use of the Facility information
element and the FACILITY message as well as other specific functional
messages specified in the present document.

4.2 Functional procedures for the control of location services
--------------------------------------------------------------

### 4.2.1 General

This subclause specifies the functional signalling procedures for the
control of location services at the radio interface.

The functional protocol utilizes functions and services defined in 3GPP
TS 24.008, 3GPP TS 44.018 and the functions of the data link layer as
defined in 3GPP TS 44.006. This protocol utilizes also definitions in
3GPP TS 24.007.

The Common Information Element Category utilizes the Facility
information element to transport the protocol defined in the present
document. The use of the Facility information element is common to many
services, and its contents indicates what type of procedure is being
requested. This category can be signalled both in the LMU to network and
the network to LMU directions.

The correlation of location service operations and their responses, is
provided by the combination of the transaction identifier of the
messages containing the Facility information element and the Invoke
identifier present within the Facility information element itself.

### 4.2.2 Common Information Element Category

The Common Information Element Category uses operations defined in the
present document for location services signalling. Procedures are
initiated by sending an operation including an invoke component. The
invoke component may yield a Return Error, Return Result or Reject
component (also included in an operation) depending on the outcome of
the procedure.

The operation state machines, and procedures for management of Invoke
IDs specified in ITU-T RecommendationÂ Q.774 White Book are used.

A REGISTER message, a FACILITY message or RELEASE COMPLETE message is
used to carry the Facility information element which includes these
operations. These operations request, acknowledge or reject the desired
location service procedure.

### 4.2.3 Location service procedures

#### 4.2.3.1 Introduction

For location service procedures independent of any call, the initiating
side must establish a MMâ€‘connection between the network and the LMU
according to the rules given in 3GPP TS 24.007 and 3GPP TS 24.008. The
LMU or the network starts the transaction by transferring a REGISTER
message across the radio interface. This transaction is identified by
the transaction identifier associated with the REGISTER message present
in the component part of the Facility information element. Following the
REGISTER message one or more FACILITY messages may be transmitted, all
of them related by the use of the same transaction identifier. If the
transaction is no longer used, it shall be released by sending a RELEASE
COMPLETE message. This procedure is specified in detail in clause 5, and
the text in clause 5 takes precedence over this introduction.

To convey the location service invocation, the Facility information
element is used. The Facility information element present either in the
REGISTER message or a subsequent message identifies the location service
involved and the type of component (i.e. Invoke, Return result, Return
error or Reject component).

When the REGISTER or FACILITY message contains a Facility information
element and the requested service is available, a FACILITY message
containing a Facility information element may be returned. One or more
exchanges of FACILITY messages may subsequently occur. To terminate the
service interaction and release the transaction identifier value, a
RELEASE COMPLETE message is sent as specified for the specific location
service procedure. The RELEASE COMPLETE message may also contain the
Facility information element.

#### 4.2.3.2 Handling of protocol errors in LCS procedures

Messages containing a Facility information element shall be checked for
protocol errors before the contents of the Facility IE is acted on. The
checks shall be performed in the following order:

1\) The message carrying the Facility IE shall be checked for protocol
errors as specified in subclauseÂ 5.7. If a protocol error is found then
the procedures in subclause 5.7 apply.

2\) The contents of the Facility IE shall be checked for protocol errors
as specified in subclauseÂ 4.2.6. If a protocol error is found then the
procedures in subclause 4.2.6 apply.

#### 4.2.3.3 Handling of other errors in LCS procedures

If the tests specified in subclause 4.2.3.2 have been passed without the
detection of a protocol error, the receiver will attempt to process the
contents of the Facility Information Element. If errors occur during
this processing (e.g. system failure, or information in the Facility IE
is incompatible with the requested operation) then the procedures
specified in the individual service specifications apply.

An example of the behaviour that could occur in this case is:

\- the LMU or network sends a Facility information element containing a
return error component in a FACILITY or RELEASE COMPLETE message. If the
FACILITY message is used then the MM Connection may continue to be used
for further signalling.

### 4.2.4 Multiple location service invocations

It is possible for several LCS transactions to be used simultaneously.
LCS transactions can also exist in parallel with other CMâ€‘Layer and MM
transactions. The handling of multiple MM connections is defined in 3GPP
TS 24.007 and 3GPP TS 24.008.

A single Facility Information Element shall not contain more than one
component.

### 4.2.5 Recovery procedures

In case a transaction is not terminated according to the normal
procedure as described in the present document the network side has to
ensure that the transaction is terminated e.g. by a supervision timer.

### 4.2.6 Generic protocol error handling for the component part of location services operations

If a location service operation is to be rejected the operation will be
denied, and provided the transaction is still in progress, an
appropriate reject component will be returned in a Facility Information
Element.

#### 4.2.6.1 Single component errors

The reject component shall be sent in a RELEASE COMPLETE message.

If the component containing the error was itself sent in a RELEASE
COMPLETE message then the contents of the component shall be ignored,
and no reject component is sent.

#### 4.2.6.2 Multiple component errors

If a single Facility IE contains more than one component then a RELEASE
COMPLETE message with the cause \"Facility rejected\" and without any
component shall be sent.

5 Location service support procedures
=====================================

5.1 General
-----------

This clause describes the location service support procedures at the
radio interface. These procedures are provided by the location service
support entity defined in 3GPP TS 24.007. The location service support
procedures provide the means to transfer messages for the location
service procedures. These procedures are regarded as the user of the
location service support.

5.2 Location service support establishment
------------------------------------------

At the beginning of each location service procedure a location service
support must be established.

### 5.2.1 Location service support establishment at the originating side

If the entity that uses the location support procedures needs to send a
REGISTER message, the location service support entity shall first
request the establishment of an MMâ€‘connection. This MMâ€‘connection is
established according to 3GPPÂ TS 24.008 and 3GPP TS 24.007. If the
network is the initiating side then MMâ€‘connection establishment may
involve paging the LMU.

The location service support entity shall send the REGISTER message as
the first CMâ€‘message on the MMâ€‘connection. The REGISTER message is sent
to the corresponding peer entity on the MMâ€‘connection and the location
service support shall be regarded as being established.

### 5.2.2 Location service support establishment at the terminating side

At the terminating side a location service support is regarded as being
established when an MMâ€‘connection is established. According 3GPP TS
24.008 this can be ascertained by the receipt of the first message, with
a new transaction identifier. For successful establishment of location
service support this message shall be a REGISTER message.

If the terminating side needs to reject the establishment of location
services support then it may be immediately initiate location services
support release (see subclause 5.4).

5.3 Location service support information transfer phase
-------------------------------------------------------

After the establishment of the location service support both users may
exchange FACILITY messages by use of the location service support.

5.4 Location service support release
------------------------------------

At the end of each location service procedure the established location
service support is released, if a permanent connection is not used.

The side closing the transaction shall release the transaction by
sending the RELEASE COMPLETE message to its corresponding peer entity.

Both location service support entities release the MMâ€‘connection
locally.

5.5 Recovery procedures
-----------------------

The location service support does not provide recovery procedures, i.e.
the operations are transparent to the location service support.

5.6 Message flow (single operation example)
-------------------------------------------

This subclause contains examples of message flows for a single
transaction consisting of a single operation. These examples may not
show all possibilities.

NOTE 1: If the network initiated operation does not require a result,
reject or error to be returned then the LMU may release the transaction
by sending a RELEASE COMPLETE message without a Facility Information
Element and release of transaction by LMU is allowed (i.e. Release
Forbidden has not been present in Register message). If release is not
allowed by LMU, the LMU sends the result using Facility message.

NOTE 2: To prevent transactions being kept open following exceptional
cases, either side of the transaction may release it by sending a
RELEASE COMPETE message without a Facility IE.

5.7 Handling of unknown, unforeseen, and erroneous protocol data
----------------------------------------------------------------

### 5.7.1 General

These procedures only apply to messages where the protocol discriminator
is set to indicate LCS operations according to the rules in 3GPP TS
24.007 and the present document. Messages that do not meet this criteria
are treated according to other GSM technical specifications.

This subclause specifies procedures for handling of unknown, unforeseen
and erroneous protocol data by the receiving entity. The procedures are
called \"error handling procedures\", but they also define a
compatibility mechanism for future extension of the protocol.

Most error handling procedures are mandatory in the LMU, but optional in
the network. Detailed error handling procedures may vary from PLMN to
PLMN.

In this subclause, the following terminology is used:

\- An IE is defined to be syntactically incorrect in a message if it
contains at least one value defined as \"reserved\" in the present
document or 3GPP TS 44.018. However, it is not a syntactical error if a
type 4 IE specifies a length indicator greater than that defined. The
component part of the Facility information element is handled by a
separate mechanism, and errors in the component part are not covered by
this subclause.

The following procedures are listed in order of precedence.

Handling of errors in the contents of the Facility IE is described in
subclause 4.2.6, and is outside the scope of this subclause.

### 5.7.2 Message too short

When a message is received that is too short to contain a complete
message type information element, that message shall be ignored.

### 5.7.3 Unknown or unforeseen transaction identifier

The LMU shall ignore messages with the transaction identifier value set
to \"111\".

If the transaction identifier value is not \"111\" the following
procedures shall apply to the LMU:

a\) If a RELEASE COMPLETE message is received specifying a transaction
identifier that is not recognized as relating to a LCS transaction that
is in progress then the message shall be ignored.

b\) If a FACILITY message is received specifying a transaction
identifier that is not recognized as relating to a LCS transaction that
is in progress then a RELEASE COMPLETE message shall be sent.

c\) If a REGISTER message is received specifying a transaction
identifier that is not recognized as relating to a LCS transaction that
is in progress and with a transaction identifier flag incorrectly set to
\"1\", this message shall be ignored.

The network may follow the same procedures.

### 5.7.4 Unknown or unforeseen message type

If the LMU receives a message type not defined for the protocol
discriminator or not implemented by the receiver, then a RELEASE
COMPLETE message shall be sent with cause value \#97 \"message type
nonâ€‘existent or not implemented\".

If the LMU receives a message type not consistent with the transaction
state then a RELEASE COMPLETE message shall be sent with cause value
\#98 \"message not compatible with control state\".

The network may follow the same procedures.

### 5.7.5 Non-semantical mandatory Information Element Error

When on receipt of a message:

\- an \"imperative message part\" error; or

\- a \"missing mandatory IE\" error;

is diagnosed, or when a message containing:

\- a syntactically incorrect mandatory IE; or

\- an IE unknown in the message, but encoded as \"comprehension
required\" (see 3GPP TS 24.007); or

\- an out of sequence IE encoded as \"comprehension required\";

is received, the LMU shall proceed as follows:

a\) If the message is not RELEASE COMPLETE it shall send a RELEASE
COMPLETE message with cause \"\#96 - Invalid mandatory information\".

b\) If the message is RELEASE COMPLETE, it shall be treated as a normal
RELEASE COMPLETE message.

The network may follow the same procedures.

### 5.7.6 Unknown and Unforeseen IEs in the nonâ€‘imperative part

#### 5.7.6.1 IEIs unknown in the message

The LMU shall ignore all IEs unknown in the message which are not
encoded as \"comprehension required\". The network shall take the same
approach.

#### 5.7.6.2 Out of sequence IEs

The LMU shall ignore all out of sequence IEs in a message which are not
encoded as \"comprehension required\".

The network may take the same approach.

#### 5.7.6.3 Repeated IEs

If an information element with format T, TV or TLV (see 3GPP TS 24.007)
is repeated in a message in which repetition of the information element
is not specified, only the contents of the information element appearing
first shall be handled and all subsequent repetitions of the information
element shall be ignored. When repetition of information elements is
specified, only the contents of specified repeated information elements
shall be handled. If the limit on repetition of information elements is
exceeded, the contents of information elements appearing first up to the
limit of repetitions shall be handled and all subsequent repetitions of
the information element shall be ignored.

The network may follow the same procedures.

### 5.7.7 Non-imperative message part errors

This category includes:

\- syntactically incorrect optional IEs;

\- conditional IE errors.

Errors in the content of the Facility IE are handled according to
subclause 4.2.6.

#### 5.7.7.1 Syntactically incorrect optional IEs (other than Facility)

The LMU shall treat all optional IEs that are syntactically incorrect in
a message as not present in the message

The network shall take the same approach.

#### 5.7.7.2 Conditional IE errors

When the LMU upon receipt of a message diagnoses a \"missing conditional
IE\" error, or an \"unexpected conditional IE error\", or when it
receives a message containing at least one syntactically incorrect
conditional IE (other than Facility), it shall send a RELEASE COMPLETE
message with cause \#100 \"conditional IE error\".

The network may follow the same procedure.

6 Message functional definitions and contents
=============================================

6.1 General
-----------

This subclause defines the structure of the messages of the layer 3
protocol defined in 3GPP TS 43.059. These messages are standard L3
messages as defined in 3GPP TS 24.007.

Each definition includes:

a\) a brief description of the message;

b\) a table listing the information elements in the order of their
appearance in the message. In a sequence of consecutive IEs with half
octet length, the first IE occupies bits 1 to 4 of octet N, the second
bits 5 to 8 of octet N, the third bits 1 to 4 of octet N+1 etc.;

For each IE the table indicates:

1\) the information element identifier, in hexadecimal notation, if the
IE has format T, TV or TLV. If the IEI has half octet length, it is
specified by a notation representing the IEI as a hexadecimal digit
followed by a \"-\" (example: B-);

2\) the name of the IE (which gives an idea of the semantics of the
element), which is used in this and other specifications as a reference
to the IE within the message;

3\) the name of the type of the IE (which indicates the coding of the
value part of the IE), and a reference to a description of the value
part of the IE;

4\) the presence requirement indication (M, C or O) for the IE, as
defined in 3GPP TS 24.007;

5\) the format of the IE (T, V, TV, LV, TLV) as defined in 3GPP TS
24.007;

6\) the length of the IE (or permissible range of lengths), in octets,
in the message, where \"?\" means that the maximum length of the IE is
only constrained by the link layer protocol, and in the case of the
facility IE by possible further considerations specified in 3GPP TS
43.059. This indication is non-normative.

c\) subclauses specifying conditions for IEs with presence requirement C
or O in the relevant message. Together with other conditions specified
in the present document and 3GPP TS 43.059 defines when the IE shall be
included or not, what non-presence of such IEs means, and (for IEs with
presence requirement C) the static conditions for presence and/or
non-presence of the IEs (see 3GPP TS 24.007).

6.2 Messages for location services control
------------------------------------------

TableÂ 6.2 summarises the messages for location services control.

The logical DTAP LCS Information Request and DTAP LCS Information Report
messages, that are used in LCS StageÂ 2 (3GPP TS 43.059), are transported
using REGISTER, FACILITY and RELEASE COMPLETE messages.

If there exists no LCS transaction between LMU and SMLC, REGISTER
message is used to deliver the logical message. If LCS transaction
between LMU and SMLC exists, FACILITY message is used to deliver the
logical message. RELEASE COMPLETE message is used to indicate that LCS
transaction is not any more needed, LMU can also use this message to
transport logical LCS Information Response message.

  --------------------------------------- -----------

6.3 Facility
------------

This message is sent by the Location Measurement Unit (LMU) or the
network to request or acknowledge a location service. It is used when
information is to be conveyed and the transaction already exists, but is
not to be released. The location service to be invoked, and its
associated parameters, are specified in the Facility information element
(see tableÂ 6.3).

### 6.5.1 Cause

This information element shall be included when the functional handling
of the Cause IE is specified in the service description. If the
functional handling of the Cause IE is not specified, the receiving
entity may ignore the IE. The Cause IE used in location services is
defined in 3GPP TS 44.018 in subclause 10.5.4.11 (only applicable Cause
values are used).

### 6.5.2 Facility

This information element shall be included as required by the service
description and the procedures defined in the present document and in
3GPP TS 43.059.

7 General message format and information elements coding
========================================================

The figures and text in this clause describe message contents. Within
each octet, the bit designated \"bit 1\" is transmitted first, followed
by bits 2, 3, 4, etc. Similarly, the octet shown at the top of each
figure is sent first.

7.1 Overview
------------

Within the layer 3 protocol defined in the present document, every
message is a standard L3 message as defined in 3GPPÂ TSÂ 24.007. This
means that the message consists of the following parts:

a\) protocol discriminator;

b\) transaction identifier;

c\) message type;

d\) other information elements, as required.

Unless specified otherwise, a particular information element may be
present only once in a given message.

When a field extends over more than one octet, the order of bit values
progressively decreases as the octet number increases. The least
significant bit of the field is represented by the lowest numbered bit
of the highest numbered octet of the field.

7.2 Protocol discriminator
--------------------------

The Protocol Discriminator (PD) and its use are defined in 3GPP TS
24.007. The present document defines the protocols relating to the PD
values:

1 1 0 0 location services

7.3 Transaction identifier
--------------------------

For general rules, format and coding of transaction identifier values,
see 3GPP TS 24.008.

7.4 Message type
----------------

The message type IE and its use are defined in 3GPP TS 24.007. Table 7.4
defines the value part of the message type IE used in the location
service protocol.

7.5 Facility information element
--------------------------------

The purpose of the Facility information element is to indicate the
invocation and operation of location services, identified by the
corresponding operation code within the Facility information element.

The Facility information element is coded as shown in figure 7.5 and
clause 8.

The Facility is a type 4 information element with no upper length limit
except that given by the maximum number of octets in a L3 message, see
3GPP TS 44.006.

Figure 7.5: Facility information element

7.6 Release forbidden
---------------------

This information element is used only in SMLC to LMU messages. The
presence of IE indicates that the release of LCS transaction is not
allowed by LMU.

8 Detailed message format and information elements coding
=========================================================

8.1 Transparent LCS Information
-------------------------------

This clause provides the formats and encoding of Transparent LCS
Information component in the Facility information element. The contents
of this component are copied directly from Signal Info (defined in
subclause 11.1). Encoding methods for the entire LLP component are based
on BASIC-PER; unaligned variant is used. Format and encoding of the
entire LLP component - part of which can be seen as a subset of ITU-T
Recommendation Q.773 - is based on and consistent with the following
ITU-T recommendations:

\- Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) \"Specification of Basic
Notation\" ITU-T Recommendation X.680 \| ISO/IEC 8824-1.

\- ASN.1 encoding rules \"Specification of Packed Encoding Rules (PER)\"
ITU-T Recommendation X.691 \| ISO/IEC 8825-2.

NOTE 1: Concerning the general rules for encoding (structure of
encoding, identifier octets, length octets, etc.) see ITU-T
Recommendations X.680 and ITU-T Recommendation X.691. For these general
rules the same exceptions apply as stated in 3GPP TS 29.002. Following
ASN.1 definitions are exactly same than in ITU-T Recommendation Q.773.

NOTE 2: invokeNotLast component is added to the Component list. This
change impacts to the coding of the Component type and thus to coding of
the LLP messages.

The Component portion of the TCAP used in this protocol, LLP, is a
modification of the TCAP Component portion defined in ITU-T
Recommendation, Q.773. Even though part of the LLP component can be seen
as a subset of TCAP, BER encoding is not used.

9 LMU LCS Protocol operation specifications
===========================================

9.1 General
-----------

This clause specifies the abstract syntax for the LMU LCS Protocol using
the Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1), defined in ITU-T
Recommendation X.680.

The encoding rules which are applicable to the defined abstract syntax
are the Packet Encoding Rules for Abstract Syntax Notation One, defined
in ITU-T Recommendation X.691. For each Location Service parameter which
has to be transferred by a Location Service message, there is a PDU
field (an ASN.1 NamedType) whose ASN.1 identifier has the same name as
the corresponding parameter, except for the differences required by the
ASN.1 notation (blanks between words are removed, the first letter of
the first word is lower-case and the first letter of the following words
are capitalized (e.g. \"bearer service\" is mapped to
\"bearerService\"). In addition some words may be abbreviated as
follows:

\- lmu location measurement unit;

\- lcs location services.

The ASN.1 data type which follows the keywords ARGUMENT \"PARAMETER\" or
\"RESULT\" (for OPERATION and ERROR) is always optional from a syntactic
point of view. However, except specific mention, it has to be considered
as mandatory from a semantic point of view. When in an invoke component,
a mandatory element is missing in any component or inner data structure,
a reject component is returned with the problem code \"Mistyped
Parameter\". When an optional element is missing in an invoke component
or in an inner data structure while it is required by the context, an
error component is returned; the associated type of error is
\"DataMissing\".

In case an element is defined as mandatory in the protocol description
(including imports from 3GPP TS 29.002), but is not present according to
the service description (stageÂ 1 to stageÂ 3), the ASN.1 protocol
description takes precedence over the diagrams in the 3GPP TS 24.08x and
3GPP TS 24.09x-series of technical specifications.

When possible operations and errors are imported from 3GPP TS 29.002.

Timer values for operations which require timers are shown as ASN.1
comments.

Ellipsis Notation shall be used in the same way as described in 3GPP TS
29.002 and shall be supported on the radio interface by the LMU and the
network for all operations defined in the present document including
those imported from 3GPP TS 29.002.

9.2 Operation types
-------------------

Table 9.2 summarizes the operations defined for LMU LCS Protocol in the
present document, and shows which of these operations are Radio
Interface Timing (RIT) related and general LMU procedures related. In
this ASN.1 module, ASN.1/88 defined in ITU-T Recommendation X.680 (ASN.1
1997) is used.

operation types from the ASN.1 module described in subclause 9.2 and
operation and error types from MAP. It defines operations by allocating
operations and errors a local value. For the involved operations and
errors the same local values as in MAP are allocated. In this ASN.1
module, ASN.1/88 defined in ITU-T Recommendation X.680 (ASN.1 1997) is
used.

------------

The messages below are considered to be transported between the SMLC and
the LMU.

### A.2.1 RIT Measurement Request Message

The RIT Measurement Request is a message from the SMLC to the LMU. As a
response to it the LMU performs Real Time Difference (RTD) or Absolute
Time Difference (ATD) measurements. It contains the following
information elements.

Table A.2.1: RIT Measurement Request message content

  -------------------------- ------------------------------------ ----------

  -------------------------- ------------------------------------ ----------

#### A.2.1.1 RIT Measurement Request Message Information Elements

##### A.2.1.1.1 Message Type IE

This IE contains the type of the message. This IE is mandatory.

##### A.2.1.1.2 Measurement Instructions IE

The purpose of the Measurement Instructions IE is to inform the LMU
about the measurement type (RTD/ATD), measurement result reporting rate,
and tell which BTSs should be measured. This IE is mandatory, and it
contains the following fields:

##### Measurement Type {#measurement-type .H6}

> This field indicates whether AT of reference BTS is required.

\'0\': AT of reference BTS should be reported. If AT of reference BTS
can not be measured, no ATD/RTD measurements are reported, but RIT Error
IE is sent instead.

\'1\': AT of reference BTS should be reported . If AT of reference BTS
can not be measured, ATD/RTD measurements are reported anyhow.

\'2\': ATD/RTD measurements timestamped with frame number of the
reference BTS should be performed.

##### Reporting Period Format {#reporting-period-format .H6}

> This field describes the units of the Reporting Period field. This
> field is optional. If this field is included, RIT Measurement
> Responses shall be send with the period indicated in this and
> Reporting Period fields.

\'0\': Reporting Period is told in tens of seconds.

\'1\': Reporting Period is in tens of minutes.

##### Reporting Period  {#reporting-period .H6}

> This field describes the value for the reporting period, i.e. the
> required time period between the RIT Measurement Response messages.
> Its units and multiplication factor are defined in the Reporting
> Period Format field. This field is conditional and included only if
> the Reporting Period Format is included.

Range: 1-120.

##### Change Limit {#change-limit .H6}

> This field indicates the limit for the change of AT or ATD /RTD values
> in units of 0.02 micro-seconds. If any AT or ATD/RTD value has changed
> more than the value in this field since the last RIT Measurement
> Response, a new RIT Measurement Response message is sent. This field
> is optional. If this field is included, RIT Measurement Responses
> shall be send when some RIT value has changed more than this limit.

Range: 1-255.

##### Deviation Limit  {#deviation-limit .H6}

> This field indicates the limit for the deviation of the AT or ATD/RTD
> values. If any time the predicted AT or ATD/RTD value (based on
> reported AT or ATD/RTD values and changes in the last RIT Measurement
> Response) has deviated more than the value in this field compared to
> the current measurement result, a new RIT Measurement Response message
> is sent. This field is optional. If this field is included, RIT
> Measurement Responses shall be send when the first deviation of some
> RIT value is more than this limit. The values are in units of 0.02
> micro-seconds.

Range: 1-255.

NOTE: Predicted AT or ATD/RTD value means the value that is calculated
(extrapolated) based on AT or ATD/RTD value and AT or ATD/RTD Change
value in last RIT Measurement Response message.

##### Monitor Period  {#monitor-period .H6}

> This field indicates the requested time period for monitoring the time
> derivative of AT or ATD/RTD values, i.e. on how long monitor period
> the reported AT or ATD/RTD change is based. The value is in tens of
> seconds. This field is optional.

Range: 1- 64.

##### Environment Characterization {#environment-characterization .H6}

> Environment Characterization field gives a LMU information about
> expected multipath and NLOS in the area.

\'0\': possibly heavy multipath and NLOS conditions (e.g. bad urban or
urban).

\'1\': no or light multipath and usually LOS conditions (e.g. suburban
or rural).

\'2\': not defined or mixed environment.

\'3\': reserved.

\'4\': reserved (i.e. several values should be reserved).

##### Neighbor Number {#neighbor-number .H6}

> This field indicates the maximum number of neighbor BTSs that the LMU
> should try to report.

Range: 0-15.

##### Neighbor Type {#neighbor-type .H6}

> This field indicates which neighbor BTSs are used for RIT
> measurements. If the value of the Neighbor Number field is lower than
> the total number of BTSs in the required list, then the BTS are
> selected in the order of the list.

\'0\': Neighbor BTSs listed in the BTS List IE are used for RIT
measurements in the order of the list.

\'1\': If possible, neighbor BTSs listed in the BTS List IE are used,
otherwise neighbors received in SYSTEM INFORMATION 2 or 5 message are
used in the order of received signal strength.

\'2\': Neighbor BTSs indicated in SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 2 or 5 are
used for RIT measurements (i.e.Â this is normal operation) in the order
of received signal strength.

\'3\': All neighbor BTSs that can be received (i.e. reported BTSs are
not limited to BTSs listed in SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 2 or 5 or BTS List
IE). Support of this option in LMU is optional.

##### CellIdMethod {#cellidmethod .H6}

> CellIdMethod field indicates whether CI or BSIC and BCCH carrier is
> used to identify neighbor BTSs in RIT Measurement Responses.

\'0\' = BSIC and BCCH carrier are used to identify the cell, even if CI
is available.

\'1\' = CI is used to identify the neighbor cell, if it is available,
otherwise BSIC and BCCH carrier are used.

##### A.2.1.1.3 BTS List IE

This information element indicates neighbor BTSs that are used for RIT
measurements. This IE is conditional. If Neighbor Type field in the
Measurement Instructions IE is \'0\' or \'1\' this field must be
included. The first BTS on the list is the reference BTS that should be
used as reference when reporting the RTD or AT values. If this reference
BTS is not available, the LMU can select the used reference BTS based on
signal strength.

This IE contains the following fields.

##### Number of BTSs  {#number-of-btss .H6}

> This field indicates, how many BTSs are included in this IE.

Range: 1 to 31.

> The following fields are repeated the number of times included in
> Number of BTSs field.

##### CI {#ci .H6}

> This field indicates the Cell Identity of the particular BTS. The
> purpose of the Cell Identity value is to identify a BTS within a
> location area.

Range: 0 - 65535.

NOTE: Here is assumed that when LMU starts to make measurements, it
firsts goes to the requested frequencies, and starts to decode BSICs and
CIs from those specific frequencies. Because of this procedure the risk
that there would be two BTSs with same CIs and same Channel numbers is
minimal (i.e. there is no need to transmit LAC).

##### Time Slot Scheme {#time-slot-scheme .H6}

> The Time Slot Scheme field indicates what kind of transmission scheme
> the particular BTS is using. If the LMU measures signals from BTSs
> from other time slots than 0 or 4, and it is informed about the burst
> length schemes used by BTSs, then it can compensate for the possible
> error. (This is necessary if the LMU averages bursts from different
> time slots, and the BTS uses varying lengths of bursts.)

\'0\' = the burst scheme is unknown (The time slot should remain the
same).

\'1\' = all time slots are 156.25 bits long.

\'2\' = time slots 0 and 4 are 157 bits long and other time slots are
156 bits long.

##### BSIC {#bsic .H6}

> This field indicates the BSIC (Base Station Identity Code) of the
> particular BTS.

Range: 0 - 63.

##### BCCH Carrier {#bcch-carrier .H6}

> This field indicates the absolute RF channel number of the particular
> BTS.

Range: 0 - 1023.
