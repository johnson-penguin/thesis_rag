4 General
=========

The present document describes the frame structure, elements of
procedure, format of fields and procedures for the proper operation of
the Link Access Procedure on the Dm channel, LAPDm.

NOTE 1: The term Dm channel is used for convenience to designate the
collection of all the various signalling channels required in the GSM
system. See also 3GPP TS 44.003.

The concepts, terminology, overview description of LAPDm functions and
procedures, and the relationship with other Technical Specifications are
described in general terms in 3GPP TS 44.005.

The frame formats defined for LAPDm are based on those defined for LAPD.
However, there are important differences between LAPDm and LAPD, in
particular with regard to frame delimitation methods and transparency
mechanisms. These differences are necessary for operation within the
constraints set by the radio path.

LAPDm supports two modes of operation:

‑ unacknowledged operation using UI frames;

‑ acknowledged operation using the multiple frame procedure.

As a choice of implementation, the two modes of operation may be
implemented independently of each other. This is possible since there is
no interactions between the two modes, other than queuing at the
transmitter, even when they coexist on the same physical channel. For
BCCHs and CCCHs only the unacknowledged mode of operation needs to be
implemented.

LAPDm is used for information sent on the control channels BCCH, AGCH,
NCH, PCH, FACCH, SACCH and SDCCH as defined in 3GPP TS 44.003.

NOTE 2: AGCH, NCH and PCH are sometimes referred to by the collective
name CCCH and FACCH, SACCH and SDCCH are, similarly, referred to by the
collective name DCCH.

LAPDm may also be used on other types of channel.

NOTE 3: As stated in 3GPP TS 44.005, the term \"data link layer\" is
used in the main text of this Technical Specification. However, mainly
in figures and tables, the terms \"layer 2\" and \"L2\" are used as
abbreviations. Furthermore, in accordance with 3GPP TS 24.007 and
3GPP TS 44.018, the term \"layer 3\" is used to indicate the layer above
the data link layer.

This Technical Specification is organized as follows:

The frame structure for peer‑to‑peer communication is given in clause 5.
The elements of procedure and formats of fields are given in clause 6.
The elements of layer‑to‑layer communication are contained in clause 7.
The details of the peer‑to‑peer procedures are given in clause 8. clause
6 summarizes the special protocol operations used mandatorily with
SAPI=0 and SAPI = 3.

The specification for the random access channel is contained in annex A,
even though it is not a LAPDm function. The present document is
descriptive and does not constrain the implementation of the random
access function. The procedure is used for CHANNEL REQUEST on the RACH
and HANDOVER ACCESS on the main DCCH.

(Annexes B to F are deleted).

Annex G gives an overview of actions taken on frames containing
parameter errors.

4.1 Options
-----------

Support of short L2 header type 1 is an option in both the mobile
station and the network; under certain conditions the support is
mandatory, as specified in other Specifications. A layer 2 protocol
entity not implementing short L2 header type 1 shall diagnose an E/A bit
error and proceed as defined in annex G.2.3.

5 Frame structure for peer-to-peer communication
================================================

5.1 General
-----------

All data link layer peer‑to‑peer exchanges are in frames conforming to
one of the formats shown in figure 1. Several format types are shown in
the figure:

‑ Format A is used on DCCHs for frames where there is no information
field.

‑ Formats B, Bter and B4 are used on DCCHs for frames containing an
information field:

‑ format Bter is used on request of higher layers if and only if short
L2 header type 1 is supported and a UI command is to be transmitted on
SAPI 0;

\- format B4 is used for UI frames transmitted by the network on SACCH;

‑ format B is applied in all other cases.

‑ Format Bbis is used only on BCCH, PCH, NCH, and AGCH.

‑ In addition there is a Format C for transmission of random access
signals.

Format C frames are described in annex A. Format A, B, Bbis, Bter and B4
frames are described in the remainder of the present document.

  ----- ------- ----------------------- ------- ------- ------- ------- ------------------ ------- ----------

Format type Bter

Figure 1 (sheet 3 of 3): General frame formats

The parameter N201 is the maximum number of octets which are partially
or entirely available for the information field of a frame. It depends
on the type of channel and the format, see sub-clause 8.8.3.

5.2 Frame delimitation and fill bits
------------------------------------

Frame delimitation is provided by the physical layer:

‑ in format type A, B and B4 frames at the beginning of the frame for
determining the start of the first octet in the address field, in format
type Bter frames for determining the start of the octet containing the
short L2 header type 1 (which is also the first octet used for the
information field), and in format type Bbis frames for determining the
start of the first octet for the information field;

‑ at the end of the frame for determining the last bit of the frame.

The end of the useful part of the frame, i.e. the end of the length
indicator field in type A frames and the end of the information field in
type B frames, is determined by a length indicator contained in the
length indicator field. The useful part of a Bbis frames takes all N201
octets of that frame. The useful part of a Bter frame takes all N201
octets of that frame except those bits of octet 1 which contain the
short L2 header type 1. The useful part of a B4 frame takes all N201
octets of that frame except those octets which contain the address field
and the control field.

If a frame contains a length indicator that has a value less than N201,
the frame contains fill bits. Each fill bit shall be set to a random
value when sent by the mobile station. Except for the first octet
containing fill bits which shall be set to the binary value
\"00101011\", each fill bit should be set to a random value when sent by
the network. Otherwise, the network shall set all octets containing fill
bits to the binary value \"00101011\".

5.3 Address field
-----------------

The address field may consist of a variable number of octets. However,
for applications on control channels the field consists of only one
octet. The address field identifies the SAP for which a command frame is
intended and the SAP transmitting a response frame. The format of the
address field is defined in sub-clause 6.2.

5.4 Control field
-----------------

The control field consists of one octet. The format of the control field
is defined in sub-clause 6.4.

5.5 Length indicator field
--------------------------

The length indicator field may consist of a variable number of octets.
However, for applications on control channels the field consists of only
one octet. The format of the field is defined in sub-clause 6.6.

5.5a Short L2 header type 1
---------------------------

The short L2 header type 1 consists of two bits. Its contents are
defined in sub-clause 6.4a.

5.6 Information field
---------------------

The information field of a frame, when present, has the position in the
frame defined in sub-clause 5.1.

The maximum number of octets in the information field (N201) is defined
in sub-clause 8.8.3.

5.7 Transparency
----------------

Because of the frame delimitation technique used (see sub-clause 5.2),
the frame can include any possible sequence of bits without the need for
additional transparency mechanisms.

5.8 Format convention
---------------------

### 5.8.1 Numbering convention

The basic convention used in this Technical Specification is illustrated
in figure 2. The bits are grouped into octets.

The bits of an octet are shown horizontally and are numbered from 1 to
8. Multiple octets are shown vertically and are numbered from 1 to n.

  ----- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ----------
  Bit   8   7   6   5   4   3   2   1   Octet no
                                        1

                                        ;
                                        
                                        ;
                                        n

### 5.8.2 Order of bit transmission

The order of bit transmission is defined in 3GPP TS 44.004.

### 5.8.3 Field mapping convention

When a field is contained within a single octet, the lowest bit number
of the field represents the lowest order value.

When a field spans more than one octet, the order of bit values within
each octet progressively decreases as the octet number increases. In
that part of the field contained in a given octet the lowest bit number
represents the lowest order value.

For example, a bit number can be identified as a couple (o, b) where o
is the octet number and b is the relative bit number within the octet.
Figure 3 illustrates a field that spans from bit (1, 3) to bit (2, 7).
The high order bit of the field is mapped on bit (1, 3) and the low
order bit is mapped on bit (2, 7).

6 Elements of procedures and formats of fields for Data Link Layer peer-to-peer communication
=============================================================================================

6.1 General
-----------

The elements of procedures define the commands and responses that are
used on the data link connections carried on the Dm channel.

Procedures are derived from these elements of procedures and are
described in clause 8.

If a bit position is marked as \"spare\", it shall be coded as \"0\".
For future compatibility reasons, an entity receiving frames, where
spare bit positions are coded otherwise, shall ignore those values
without notification of any error.

6.2 Address field format
------------------------

The field consists of:

‑ the address field extension bit EA;

‑ the command/response bit C/R;

‑ the SAPI;

‑ and the Link Protocol Discriminator LPD.

The format of the address field for control channels is shown in
figure 4.

The address field extension bit, EA, enables extension of the field to
span more than one octet. The value \"0\" is used to indicate an
extension, the value \"1\" shall be used for the final address field
octet.

The Link Protocol Discriminator (LPD) corresponding to the use in this
Technical Specification shall take the value \"0 0\", all other values
are reserved.

NOTE: LPD = \"0 1\" corresponds to the data link protocol used for SMSCB
(see 3GPP TS 44.012).

  ----- ------- ----- ------ ----- ----- --- --- ---

Figure 4: Address field format

6.3 Address field variables
---------------------------

### 6.3.1 Address field extension bit (EA)

The address field range is extended by reserving the first transmitted
bit of the address field octets to indicate the final octet of the
address field. The presence of a \"1\" in the first bit of an address
field octet signals that it is the final octet of the address field.
Figure 4 shows the case where the field consists of one octet.

### 6.3.2 Command/response field bit (C/R)

The C/R bit identifies a frame as either a command or a response. The MS
side shall send commands with the C/R bit set to \"0\", and responses
with the C/R bit set to \"1\". The BS side shall do the opposite; that
is commands are sent with C/R set to \"1\", and responses are sent with
C/R set to \"0\". The combinations for the BS side and MS side are shown
in table 1.

### 6.3.3 Service access point identifier (SAPI)

The service access point identifier (SAPI) identifies a point at which
data link layer services are provided by the data link layer to a
layer 3 entity (see 3GPP TS 44.005). The SAPI allows 8 service access
points to be specified initially, where bit 3 of the address field octet
containing the SAPI is the least significant binary digit and bit 5 is
the most significant.

The SAPI values are allocated as shown in table 2.

Table 2: Allocation of SAPI values

  All others   Reserved for future standardization
  ------------ ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

6.4 Control field formats
-------------------------

The control field identifies the type of frame, which will be either a
command or a response. The control field will contain sequence numbers,
where applicable.

Three types of control field formats are specified: numbered information
transfer (I format), supervisory functions (S format), and unnumbered
information transfer and control functions (U format). The control field
formats for LAPDm are shown in table 3.

### 6.4.1 Information transfer format - I

The I format shall be used to perform an information transfer between
layer 3 entities. The functions of N(S), N(R) and P are independent;
that is, each I frame has an N(S) sequence number, an N(R) sequence
number which may or may not acknowledge additional I frames received by
the data link layer entity, and a P bit that may be set to \"0\" or
\"1\". The use of N(S), N(R) and P is defined in sub-clause 8.

### 6.4.2 Supervisory format - S

The S format shall be used to perform data link supervisory control
functions such as: acknowledge I frames, request retransmission of
I frames, and request a temporary suspension of transmission of
I frames. The functions of N(R) and P/F are independent; that is, each
supervisory frame has an N(R) sequence number which may or may not
acknowledge additional I frames received by the data link layer entity,
and a P/F bit that may be set to \"0\" or \"1\".

The use of N(R) and the P/F bit is described in sub-clause 8.

### 6.4.3 Unnumbered format - U

The U format shall be used to provide additional data link control
functions and unacknowledged information transfer.

This format does not contain sequence numbers. It does include a P/F bit
that may be set to \"0\" or \"1\".

+-----------------------------+------+-----+------+-----+---+---+---+---+

For definition of values for supervisory function bits and unnumbered
function bits, see table 4.

6.4a Short L2 header type 1
---------------------------

The short L2 header type 1 field is used in format Bter frames, see
sub-clause 5.1. It consists of 2 bits, both shall take value 0.

NOTE: Introduction of further short L2 header types (longer than 2 bits,
setting bit 2 to \"1\" and bit 1 to \"0\") is for further study.

The short L2 header type 1 implicitly defines a UI command frame
belonging to SAPI=0, with length N201. All other parameters of a L2
frame header are irrelevant.

6.5 Control field parameters and associated state variables
-----------------------------------------------------------

The various parameters associated with the control field formats are
described in this sub-clause. The coding of the bits within these
parameters is such that the lowest numbered bit within the parameter
field is the least significant bit.

### 6.5.1 Poll/Final bit

All frames contain P/F, the Poll/Final bit. The Poll/Final (P/F) bit
serves a function in both command frames and response frames. In command
frames the P/F bit is referred to as the P bit. In response frames it is
referred to as the F bit.

The P bit set to \"1\" is used by a data link layer entity to create
(poll) a response frame from the peer data link layer entity. The F bit
set to \"1\" is used by a data link layer entity to indicate the
response frame transmitted as a result of a soliciting (poll) command.

The use of the P/F bit is described in sub-clause 8.

### 6.5.2 Multiple frame operation - variables and sequence numbers

#### 6.5.2.1 Modulus

Each I frame is sequentially numbered by a sequence number which may
have the value 0 through 7.

Arithmetics acting on variables which are related to such sequence
numbers (i.e. N(S), N(R), V(S), V(R), V(A); see following sub-clauses)
operate modulo 8.

NOTE: Modulo 8 operation on negative numbers is performed by adding
multiples of 8 to the negative number until the result becomes
nonnegative. Then common modulo 8 operation is applied.

#### 6.5.2.2 Send state variable V(S)

Each point‑to‑point data link connection endpoint shall have an
associated send state variable (V(S)) when using I frame commands. The
send state variable denotes the sequence number of the next in‑sequence
I frame to be transmitted.

The send state variable can take on the value 0 through 7.

The value of the send state variable shall be incremented by 1 with each
successive I frame transmission, and shall not exceed V(A) by more than
the maximum number of outstanding I frames k (The window size k is
defined in sub-clause 8.8.4.). The value of k may be in the range of
1=\<k=\<7.

#### 6.5.2.3 Acknowledge state variable V(A)

Each point‑to‑point data link connection endpoint shall have an
associated acknowledge state variable (V(A)) when using I frame commands
and supervisory frame commands/responses.

The acknowledge state variable identifies the last frame that has been
acknowledged by its peer (V(A) ‑ 1 equals the N(S) of the last
acknowledged I frame). The acknowledge state variable can take on the
value 0 through 7. The value of the acknowledge state variable shall be
updated by the valid N(R) values received from its peer (see 6.5.2.6). A
valid N(R) value is one that is in the range V(A)=\<N(R)=\<V(S).

NOTE: These inequalities shall be interpreted in the following way:\
N(R) is called valid, if and only if (N(R)‑V(A)) mod 8 \<= (V(S)‑V(A))
mod 8.\
Furthermore, from sub-clause 6.5.2.2., it is obvious that (V(S)‑V(A))
mod 8 \<= k.

#### 6.5.2.4 Send sequence number N(S)

Only I frames contain N(S), the send sequence number of transmitted
I frames. At the time that an in‑sequence I frame is designated for
transmission, the value of N(S) is set equal to the value of the send
state variable V(S).

#### 6.5.2.5 Receive state variable V(R)

Each point‑to‑point data link connection endpoint shall have an
associated receive state variable (V(R)) when using I frame commands and
supervisory frame commands/responses. The receive state variable denotes
the sequence number of the next in‑sequence I frame expected to be
received. The receive state variable can take on the value 0 through 7.

The value of the receive state variable shall be incremented by one with
the receipt of an error‑free, in‑sequence I frame whose send sequence
number N(S) equals the receive state variable V(R).

#### 6.5.2.6 Receive sequence number N(R)

All I frames and supervisory frames contain N(R), the expected send
sequence number of the next received I frame.

At the time that a frame of the above types is designated for
transmission, the value of N(R) is set equal to the current value of the
receive state variable V(R). N(R) indicates that the data link layer
entity transmitting the N(R) has correctly received all I frames
numbered up to and including N(R) ‑ 1.

#### 6.5.2.7 Other parameters and variables

For definition and values of parameters and variables such as timer
T200, maximum number of retransmissions (N200), window size (k) and the
maximum number of octets in an information field (N201), see sub-clause
8.8.

### 6.5.3 Unacknowledged operation variables and parameters

The only parameter defined for unacknowledged operation is the number of
octets (N201) in the information field of the UI frame. See sub-clause
8.8.3.

6.6 Length indicator field format
---------------------------------

The format of the length indicator field for control channels is shown
in figure 5.

The length indicator field extension bit, EL, enables extension of the
field to span more than one octet.

  ----- --- --- ----- --- --- --- --- ---
  Bit   8   7   6     5   4   3   2   1

        L   M   EL\                   
                =1                    
  ----- --- --- ----- --- --- --- --- ---

Figure 5: Length indicator field format

The field consists of the field extension bit, EL, the more data bit, M,
and the length indicator, L.

6.7 Length indicator field variables
------------------------------------

### 6.7.1 Length indicator field extension bit (EL)

The length indicator field is extended by reserving the first
transmitted bit of the length indicator field octets to indicate the
final octet of the field. Presence of a \"1\" in the first bit of a
length indicator field octet signals that it is the final octet of the
field. Figure 5 shows the case where the field consists of one octet.

### 6.7.2 More data bit (M)

The more data bit, M, is used to indicate segmentation of layer 3
message units on data link layer frames. Layer 3 messages, which need to
be segmented, shall only be transported by I‑frames.

When the M bit is set to \"1\", it indicates that the information field
of the frame contains only a segment of the layer 3 message unit.

The M bit set to \"0\" indicates:

i\) that the information field contains a complete layer 3 message unit
provided that the M bit of the previous frame was set to \"0\";

ii\) that the information field contains the last segment of a layer 3
message unit if the M bit of the previous frame was set to \"1\".

When the M bit is set to \"1\", the information field shall contain the
maximum number of octets, N201, that an information frame can contain,
see sub-clause 8.8.3 for the value of N201.

In frames other than information (I) frames the M bit shall be set to
\"0\".

### 6.7.3 Length indicator (L)

The length indicator consists of 6 bits and is used to indicate the
number of octets contained in the information field of UI, SABM, UA or
I frames, i e any value from 0 to N201 inclusive.

The L = 0 shall be used in frames not containing an information field.

6.8 Commands and responses
--------------------------

The following commands and responses are used by either the MS or the BS
data link layer entities and are represented in table 4. Each data link
connection supports the appropriate set of commands and responses for
the type of operation desired (see sub-clause 8).

For purposes of the LAPDm procedures, frames with the supervisory
function bit encoding \"11\" and those encodings of the unnumbered
function bits in table 3 not identified in table 4 are identified as
\"invalid or not implemented\" command and response control fields and
shall be treated as defined in sub-clause 8.7.3.

The commands and responses in table 4 are defined as follows.

### 6.8.1 Information (I) commands

The function of the information (I) command is to transfer, across a
data link connection, sequentially numbered frames containing
information fields provided by layer 3. This command is used in the
multiple frame operation.

  ---------------------- ----------------------- -------------- ----------------- ----- --------- -----

### 6.8.2 Set asynchronous balanced mode (SABM) command

The SABM unnumbered command is used to place the addressed user side or
network side into the modulo 8 multiple frame acknowledged operation.

An information field is permitted with the SABM command only if it is
used in the MS to BSS direction in order to establish a SAPI 0 data link
(for contention resolution after having transmitted a random access
frame on the RACH or in response to a PACKET CS COMMAND message).
Layer 3 will indicate when an information field is to be included (see
sub-clause 8.4.1 for procedures).

A data link layer entity confirms acceptance of a SABM command by the
transmission at the first opportunity of a UA response. Upon acceptance
of this command, the data link layer entity\'s send state variable V(S),
acknowledge state variable V(A), and receive state variable V(R), are
set to 0. The transmission of an SABM command indicates the clearance of
any exception condition, in particular a busy condition that was
reported by the earlier transmission of an RNR frame by that same data
link layer entity.

Previously transmitted I frames that are unacknowledged when this
command is actioned remain unacknowledged and shall be discarded. It is
the responsibility of a higher layer (for example, layer 3) to recover
from the possible loss of the contents of such I frames.

NOTE: SABM frames cannot contain layer 3 message units which have to be
segmented.

### 6.8.3 Disconnect (DISC) command

The DISC unnumbered command is transmitted in order to terminate the
multiple frame operation.

NOTE: See sub-clause 8.4.4.4 for local end release where the multiple
frame operation is terminated without transmitting a DISC command frame.

No information field is permitted with the DISC command.

Prior to actioning the command, the data link layer entity receiving the
DISC command confirms the acceptance of a DISC command by the
transmission of a UA response. The data link layer entity sending the
DISC command terminates the multiple frame operation when it receives
the acknowledging UA or DM response.

Previously transmitted I frames that are unacknowledged when this
command is actioned remain unacknowledged and shall be discarded. It is
the responsibility of a higher layer (for example, layer 3) to recover
from the possible loss of the contents of such I frames.

### 6.8.4 Unnumbered information (UI) command

When a layer 3 entity requests unacknowledged information transfer, the
UI unnumbered command shall be used to send information to its peer
without affecting data link layer variables. UI command frames do not
carry a sequence number. Therefore, the UI frame may be lost without
notification to the layer 3 entity if a data link exception occurs
during transmission of the command.

The request of unacknowledged information transfer may require short L2
header type 1. If the layer 2 entity does not support short L2 header
type 1, it shall report an MDL‑ERROR‑INDICATION with error cause \"short
L2 header type 1 not supported\". If short L2 header type 1 is not
applicable for the intended information transfer, it shall report an
MDL‑ERROR‑INDICATION with error cause \"short L2 header type 1 not
applicable\". If the request is not erroneous, it shall transfer the
information as specified in a format Bter frame.

### 6.8.5 Receive ready (RR) command/response

The receive ready (RR) supervisory frame is used by a data link layer
entity to:

a\) indicate it is ready to receive an I frame;

b\) acknowledge previously received I frames numbered up to and
including N(R) ‑ 1 (as defined in sub-clause 8);

c\) clear a busy condition that was indicated by the earlier
transmission of an RNR frame by that same data link layer entity.

In addition to indicating the status of a data link layer entity, the RR
command with the P bit set to \"1\" may be used by the data link layer
entity to ask for the status of its peer data link layer entity.

No information field is permitted with the RR command/response.

### 6.8.6 Reject (REJ) command/response

The reject (REJ) supervisory frame is used by a data link layer entity
to request retransmission of I frames starting with the frame numbered
N(R). The value of N(R) in the REJ frame acknowledges I frames numbered
up to and including N(R) ‑ 1. New I frames pending initial transmission
shall be transmitted following the retransmitted I frames.

Only one REJ exception condition for a given direction of information
transfer shall be established at a time. The REJ exception condition is
cleared (reset) upon the receipt of an I frame with an N(S) equal to the
N(R) of the REJ frame.

The transmission of an REJ frame shall also indicate the clearance of
any busy condition within the sending data link layer entity that was
reported by the earlier transmission of an RNR frame by that same data
link layer entity.

In addition to indicating the status of a data link layer entity, the
REJ command with the P bit set to \"1\" may be used by the data link
layer entity to ask for the status of its peer data link layer entity.

No information field is permitted with the REJ command/response.

### 6.8.7 Receive not ready (RNR) command/response

The receive not ready (RNR) supervisory frame shall be used by a data
link layer entity to indicate a busy condition; that is, a temporary
inability to accept additional incoming I frames. The value of N(R) in
the RNR frame acknowledges I frames numbered up to and including N(R) ‑
1.

Acknowledgement of subsequent I frames transmitted before the indication
of the peer receiver busy is received, will be made in subsequent
exchanges if they arrive after the peer receiver busy condition has been
cleared.

In addition to indicating the status of a data link layer entity, the
RNR command with the P bit set to \"1\" may be used by the data link
layer entity to ask for the status of its peer data link layer entity.

No information field is permitted with the RNR command/ response.

NOTE: The protocol operation used on control channels with SAPI=0 or
SAPI=3 shall not utilize the RNR frame type and related procedures.
Therefore RNR frames received in those cases can be ignored.

### 6.8.8 Unnumbered acknowledgement (UA) response

The UA unnumbered response is used by a data link layer entity to
acknowledge the receipt and acceptance of the mode setting commands
(SABM or DISC). Received mode setting commands are not actioned until
the UA response is transmitted.

An information field is permitted with the UA response, i e if an SABM
command with an information field is received and the SABM is to be
acknowledged, the UA response to that command shall contain the same
information field as received in the SABM command.

The transmission of the UA response indicates the clearance of any busy
condition that was reported by the earlier transmission of an RNR frame
by that same data link layer entity.

### 6.8.9 Disconnected mode (DM) response

The DM unnumbered response is used by a data link layer entity to report
to its peer that the data link layer is in a state such that multiple
frame operation cannot be performed. A data link layer entity shall
transmit a DM response to any valid command received which it cannot
action.

No information field is permitted with the DM response.

7 Elements for layer-to-layer communication
===========================================

7.1 Definition of primitives and parameters
-------------------------------------------

Communications between layers and between the data link layer and
layer 3 are accomplished by means of primitives.

Primitives represent, in an abstract way, the logical exchange of
information and control between the data link layer and adjacent layers.
They do not specify or constrain implementations.

Primitives consist of commands and their respective responses associated
with the services requested of a lower layer. The general syntax of a
primitive is:

XX ‑ Generic name ‑ Type (Parameters);

where XX designates the layer providing the service. For the present
document XX is DL for the data link layer, PH for the physical layer and
MDL for administrative functions (e.g. error reporting and recovery).

### 7.1.1 Generic names

The generic name specifies the activity that the identified layer should
perform. Table 5 illustrates the primitives defined in the present
document.

The primitive generic names that are defined in the present document
are:

#### 7.1.1.1 DL‑ESTABLISH

The DL‑ESTABLISH primitives are used to request, confirm and indicate
the outcome of the procedures for establishing multiple frame operation.

#### 7.1.1.2 DL‑RELEASE

The DL‑RELEASE primitives are used to request, confirm and indicate the
outcome of the procedures for terminating a previously established
multiple frame operation.

In the case of a data link layer malfunction, layer 3 will be notified
by a RELEASE indication.

#### 7.1.1.3 DL‑DATA

The DL‑DATA primitives are used to pass to and from the data link layer
layer 3 message units which are to be transmitted, or have been
received, using multiple frame acknowledged operation.

#### 7.1.1.4 DL‑UNIT DATA

The DL‑UNIT DATA primitives are used to pass to and from the data link
layer, layer 3 message units which are to be transmitted, or have been
received, using unacknowledged operation.

#### 7.1.1.5 DL‑SUSPEND

The DL‑SUSPEND primitive is used in the mobile station by the radio
resource management entity to perform a local end release in such a way,
that the layer 3 data units and the state of the transmit and receive
counters are saved.

#### 7.1.1.6 DL-RESUME

The DL‑RESUME primitive is used in the mobile station by the radio
resource management entity to establish multiple frame operation and
resume communication with the network without loss of layer 3 messages.
The layer 3 data unit passed to layer 2 together with that primitive is
sent with priority (e.g. ASSIGNMENT COMPLETE or HANDOVER COMPLETE).

#### 7.1.1.7 DL-RECONNECT

The DL‑RECONNECT primitive is used in the mobile station by the radio
resource management entity to restore multiple frame operation on the
old channel after failure of the channel change. The layer 3 data unit
passed to layer 2 with previous DL‑RESUME‑REQUEST (i.e. ASSIGNMENT
COMPLETE or HANDOVER COMPLETE) is discarded and the layer 3 data unit
passed together with that primitive is sent with priority (e.g.
ASSIGNMENT FAILURE or HANDOVER FAILURE).

#### 7.1.1.8 DL-RANDOM ACCESS

The DL‑RANDOM ACCESS primitives are used to request (in the MS) the
sending of a random access message, to confirm (in the MS) the
transmission of the random access message including the time slot in
which it was sent, and to indicate (in the network) the arrival of a
random access message.

#### 7.1.1.9 MDL-RELEASE

The MDL‑RELEASE primitives are used by layer 3 entity to request local
end termination of a previously established acknowledged mode operation.

#### 7.1.1.10 MDL‑ERROR 

The MDL‑ERROR primitives are used to notify layer 3 that an error has
occurred, detected as a result of communication with the data link peer
entity, which cannot be corrected by the data link layer.

#### 7.1.1.11 PH‑DATA

The PH‑DATA primitives are used to pass message units containing frames
used for data link layer peer‑to‑peer communications to and from the
physical layer.

#### 7.1.1.12 PH‑RANDOM ACCESS

The PH‑RANDOM ACCESS primitives are used to request (in the MS) the
sending of a random access frame, to confirm (in the MS) the
transmission of the random access frame including the time slot in which
it was sent, and to indicate (in the network) the arrival of a random
access frame.

#### 7.1.1.13 PH‑CONNECT

The PH‑CONNECT primitive is used to indicate that a specific type of
channel has been connected at the physical layer.

#### 7.1.1.14 PH‑READY‑TO‑SEND

The PH‑READY‑TO‑SEND primitive is generated by the physical layer to
enable the data link layer to synchronize to the next instant of
physical transmission. On receipt of this indication layer 2 may trigger
piggy backing (if applicable), the start of T200 and the forwarding of
data units to layer 1.

#### 7.1.1.15 PH‑EMPTY‑FRAME

The PH‑EMPTY‑FRAME primitive can be used by the data link layer instead
of a PH‑DATA‑REQUEST primitive, when no frame has to be transmitted
after receiving the PH‑READY‑TO‑SEND indication. It enables handling of
several layer 2 entities by layer 1 and transmission of fill frames, if
necessary.

### 7.1.2 Primitives types

The primitives types defined in the present document are:

NOTE: For the action sequence of these primitive types, see
3GPP TS 44.001.

#### 7.1.2.1 REQUEST

The REQUEST primitive type is used when a higher layer is requesting a
service from the next lower layer.

#### 7.1.2.2 INDICATION

The INDICATION primitive type is used by a layer providing a service to
notify the next higher layer of activities related to the REQUEST
primitive type.

#### 7.1.2.3 RESPONSE

The RESPONSE primitive type is used by a layer to acknowledge receipt,
from the next lower layer, of the INDICATION primitive type.

#### 7.1.2.4 CONFIRM

The CONFIRM primitive type is used by the layer providing the requested
service to confirm that the activity has been completed.

Figure 6 illustrates the relationship of the primitive types to the
layer 3 and the data link layer.

data link layer

### 7.1.3 Parameter definition

#### 7.1.3.1 Message unit

The message unit contains additional layer‑to‑layer information
concerning actions and results associated with requests. In the case of
the DATA and UNIT DATA primitives, the message unit contains the
requesting layer peer‑to‑peer messages For example, the DL‑DATA message
unit contains the layer 3 message unit; the PH‑DATA message unit
contains the data link layer frame.

NOTE: The operations across the data link layer/layer 3 boundary shall
be such that the layer sending the DATA or UNIT DATA primitive can
assume a temporal order of the bits within the message unit and that the
layer receiving the primitive can reconstruct the message with its
assumed temporal order.

#### 7.1.3.2 Channel type

Since the Dm channel procedures are distributed on several types of
channel (CCCH, BCCH and various types of DCCH), a parameter will be
needed in order to distribute the layer 3 message units correctly on the
various types of channel. The control channel types to be used are
defined in 3GPP TS 44.003.

#### 7.1.3.3 Service Access Point

Since data links on different SAPIs may be multiplexed, the SAPI
parameter is used to indicate the respective association.

#### 7.1.3.4 Release mode

The release mode parameter is used to enable the data link layer to
operate in different release modes depending on whether the data link is
to be released in the normal way or that a local end release shall take
place on command from the layer 3. The values of the parameter are:

‑ normal;

‑ local end release.

#### 7.1.3.5 Error cause

This parameters is used by the data link layer to report procedure error
to layer 3. The following causes may be reported:

‑ timer T200 expired (N200 +1) times: perform abnormal release;

‑ re‑establishment request;

‑ unsolicited UA response;

‑ unsolicited DM response;

‑ unsolicited DM response, multiple frame established state: perform
abnormal release;

‑ unsolicited supervisory response;

‑ sequence error: perform abnormal release;

‑ U frame with incorrect parameters;

\- short L2 header type 1 not supported;

\- short L2 header type 1 not applicable;

‑ S frame with incorrect parameters;

‑ I frame with incorrect use of M bit;

‑ I frame with incorrect length;

‑ frame not implemented;

‑ SABM command, multiple frame established state;

‑ SABM command with information field not allowed in this state.

#### 7.1.3.6 Establish mode

This parameter is used in the MS to indicate to the data link layer the
type of establishment that is required. The parameter takes the
following values:

‑ normal;

‑ contention resolution.

#### 7.1.3.7 L2 header type

This parameter is used by higher layers to ask for application of a
specific L2 header type; as values for the parameter, only \"short L2
header type 1\" and \"normal L2 header\" are actually defined.

#### 7.1.3.8 Priority

This parameter is used by the higher layers to indicate the priority of
a Layer 3 message on SAPI 0 with multiple frame operation. The parameter
is not applicable to unacknowledged information transfer or to other
SAPIs. The parameter takes the following values:

\- high;

\- normal;

\- low.

The parameter need not be included if the higher layers do not support
the sending of low priority messages as defined in 3GPP TS 44.018. If
the parameter is not included, the data link layer shall assume a
priority value of \"normal\".

NOTE 1: Table 5 and table 6 do not contain a complete list of
conditional dependencies of service primitive parameters. If a field is
left blank, the respective parameter shall not be used or is not
applicable. If a field is marked by \"any\", the respective parameter
shall be used and shall be set to a valid value according its
specification.

NOTE 2: In table 5 and table 6, the term \"DCCH\" denotes the respective
main DCCH (i.e. SDCCH or FACCH).

7.2 Primitive procedures
------------------------

The procedures in the MS and the network are described by use of the
primitives defined above. See also 3GPP TS 44.018.

8 Definition of the peer‑to‑peer protocol LAPDm
===============================================

8.1 General
-----------

In the following sub-clauses, a protocol for use by the data link layer
on the radio interface is specified, referred to as \"LAPDm\". Beside
this, there may be signalling and data transfer between layer 3
entities, which does not comply to the procedures described hereafter
(e.g. for the random access procedure see annex A; for short message
cell broadcast see 3GPP TS 44.012).

The LAPDm elements of procedure (frame types) which apply are:

a\) for unacknowledged information transfer (sub-clause 8.3):

UI‑command.

b\) for multiple frame acknowledged information transfer
(sub-clauses 8.4 to 8.8):

SABM‑command;

UA‑response;

DM‑response;

DISC‑command;

RR‑command/response;

RNR‑command/response;

REJ‑command/response;

I‑command.

For the various channel types the following applies:

‑ BCCH; unacknowledged operation only;

‑ CCCH; unacknowledged operation only;

‑ all types of DCCH; unacknowledged operation and multiple frame
acknowledged operation.

For acknowledged mode (multiple frame operation) on SAPI=0 and SAPI=3, a
special protocol operation shall be used mandatorily, as specified in
sub-clause 9.

For handling of timers, the procedures and terminology of CCITT
Recommendation Z.100 will be used, i.e.

set \<timer name\> means that:

a\) if the timer is inactive, the timer becomes active, i e a timer
value is associated with the timer and it starts running;

b\) if the timer is active, the timer is first reset, as in c) below and
then set as in a) above;

reset \<timer name\> means that:

c\) if the timer is active, the timer becomes inactive, i e the
association with the timer value is lost and it stops running;

d\) if the timer is inactive, it remains inactive.

NOTE: The task set T200 shall be performed at the instant right before
transmitting a frame, when the PH‑READY‑TO‑SEND primitive is received
from the physical layer.

8.2 General Protocol Procedures
-------------------------------

### 8.2.1 Unacknowledged information transfer

Higher layers may ask for unacknowledged transmission transfer with
normal L2 header; higher layers may also ask for unacknowledged
transmission transfer on SAPI 0 using short L2 header type 1.

When a protocol entity receives a valid UI frame, this requires no
further response to the transmitting entity.

For unacknowledged information transfer with normal L2 header, the P/F
bit is not used and shall be set to \"0\".

### 8.2.2 Acknowledged multiple frame information transfer

A data link layer entity receiving an SABM, DISC, RR, REJ or I command,
shall respond to the originating entity by an appropriate response frame
(as specified in sub-clauses 8.4 through 8.7 ) within the time limits
given in sub-clause 8.9.

If the received command frame carries a P bit set to \"1\", the F bit in
the corresponding response frame shall be set to \"1\", too.

Frames containing SAPI values not used by the current version of the
present document, shall be ignored without any notification.

8.3 Procedures for unacknowledged information transfer
------------------------------------------------------

### 8.3.1 General

The procedures which apply to the transmission of information in
unacknowledged operation are defined below.

No data link layer error recovery procedures are defined for
unacknowledged operation.

### 8.3.2 Transmission of unacknowledged information

NOTE 1: The term \"transmission of a UI frame\" refers to the delivery
of a UI frame by the data link layer to the physical layer.

Unacknowledged information is passed to the data link layer by layer 3
using the primitive DL‑UNIT DATA‑REQUEST. This DL‑UNIT DATA‑REQUEST
specifies whether a short L2 header type 1 is to be used or not. The
layer 3 message unit shall be transmitted in a UI command frame.

Layer 2 shall construct a layer 2 message unit from the layer 3 message
unit and pass it to layer 1 for transmission using the primitive
PH‑DATA‑REQ. The layer 2 message unit uses the frame type as defined in
sub-clause 5.1.

If the layer 2 message unit contains a control field, the P bit shall be
set to \"0\".

NOTE 2: On a DCCH, UI frames with the length indicator set to \"0\" may
be used as fill frames, see sub-clause 8.4.2.3.

### 8.3.3 Receipt of unacknowledged information

On receipt of a UI command frame with a SAPI which is supported by the
receiver, the contents of the information field shall be passed to the
layer 3 entity identified by the SAPI using the data link layer to
layer 3 primitive DL‑UNIT DATA‑INDICATION. UI frames with invalid SAPI
values shall be discarded. UI frames received with the length indicator
set to \"0\" shall be ignored.

8.4 Procedures for establishment and release of multiple frame operation
------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 8.4.1 Establishment of multiple frame operation

#### 8.4.1.1 General

These procedures shall be used to establish multiple frame operation
between the BS and a designated MS entity.

Layer 3 will initiate the establishment procedure after a physical
channel supporting this type of operation (see sub-clause 8.1) has been
allocated to the MS.

NOTE: In order to avoid loss of layer 3 information if the SABM has to
be retransmitted because the UA response message is lost, the data link
layer should be established when needed by the entity that will send an
I command frame. For SAPI 0 the data link is always established by the
MS.

Two establishment procedures are specified:

‑ normal establishment where the SABM does not contain an information
field. Layer 3 will indicate a request for this type of establishment by
the use of the DL‑ESTABLISH‑REQUEST primitive (sub-clauses 8.4.1.2 and
8.4.1.3);

‑ contention resolution where the SABM contains an information field.
The procedure is always initiated by the MS, i e the SABM is sent by the
MS. Layer 3 will indicate a request for this type of establishment by
the use of the DL‑ESTABLISH‑REQUEST primitive containing the layer 3
message unit (sub-clauses 8.4.1.4 and 8.4.1.5). This procedure is only
applicable for SAPI 0.

Re‑establishment may be initiated, using the normal establishment
procedure, as a result of the data link layer procedure defined in
sub-clause 8.6.

#### 8.4.1.2 Normal establishment procedures

A data link layer entity shall initiate a request for the multiple frame
operation to be set by transmitting the Set Asynchronous Balanced Mode
(SABM) command with the P bit set to \"1\". Since the
DL‑ESTABLISH‑REQUEST primitive does not contain a layer 3 message unit,
the length indicator, L, is set to \"0\".

All existing exception conditions shall be cleared, the retransmission
counter shall be reset, and timer T200 shall be set right before
transmitting a frame, when the PH‑READY‑TO‑SEND primitive is received
from the physical layer (timer T200 is defined in sub-clause 8.8.1).

The establishment procedure implies the discard of any outstanding
DL‑DATA‑REQUEST primitive which has been invoked prior to the
DL‑ESTABLISH‑REQUEST. It also implies the discard of any segmented
layer 3 message unit for which the last segment has not been received
(see sub-clause 8.5.2 for the concatenation procedure).

All frames other than unnumbered frame formats received during the
establishment procedures shall be ignored.

A data link layer entity receiving an SABM, if it is able to enter the
multiple‑frame‑established state, shall:

‑ respond with an Unnumbered Acknowledgement (UA) response with the F
bit set to the same binary value as the P bit in the received SABM
command, the same SAPI value as in the received SABM command, and with
the length indicator, L, set to \"0\";

‑ set the send state variable V(S), receive state variable V(R) and
acknowledge state variable V(A) to 0;

‑ enter the multiple‑frame‑established state and inform the associated
layer 3 entity using the primitive DL‑ ESTABLISH‑INDICATION;

‑ clear all existing exception conditions;

‑ clear an existing peer receiver busy condition.

If the data link layer entity is unable to enter the
multiple‑frame‑established state, it shall respond to the SABM command
with a DM response with the F bit set to the same binary value as the P
bit in the received SABM command.

Upon reception of the UA response with the F bit set to \"1\", the
originator of the SABM command shall:

‑ reset timer T200;

‑ set the send state variable V(S), the receive state variable V(R) and
the acknowledge state variable V(A) to 0;

‑ enter the multiple‑frame‑established state and inform the associated
layer 3 entity using the primitive DL‑ ESTABLISH‑CONFIRM.

A UA response with the F bit set to \"0\" shall be ignored.

Upon reception of a DM response with F bit set to \"1\", the originator
of the SABM command shall indicate this to the layer 3 entity by means
of the primitive DL‑RELEASE‑ INDICATION and reset timer T200. DM
responses with the F bit set to \"0\" shall be ignored.

#### 8.4.1.3 Procedure on expiry of timer T200: Normal establishment

If timer T200 expires before the UA or DM response is received, the data
link layer entity shall:

‑ retransmit the SABM command as above;

‑ set timer T200 right before transmitting a frame, when the
PH‑READY‑TO‑SEND primitive is received from the physical layer; and

‑ increment the retransmission counter.

After retransmission of the SABM command N200 times, the data link layer
entity shall indicated this to the associated layer 3 entity by means of
the primitive DL‑ RELEASE‑INDICATION. Layer 3 shall also be notified by
using the primitive MDL‑ERROR‑INDICATION with the cause \"timer T200
expired N200 + 1 times: perform abnormal release\".

The value of N200 is defined in sub-clause 8.8.2.

#### 8.4.1.4 Contention resolution establishment procedure

This procedure is always initiated by the MS for establishing a data
link in order to resolve contention after having accessed the BS on the
RACH. The procedure may also be used by the MS for establishing a data
link in response to a PACKET CS COMMAND message (see 3GPP TS 44.060).
Layer 3 decides when this establishment procedure is to be used and will
request the data link layer to initiate the procedure by a
DL‑ESTABLISH‑REQUEST primitive containing the layer 3 message unit and
with the parameter established mode set to contention resolution.

The data link layer shall, however, ignore any such service request if
it is not in the idle state when the request is received.

The data link layer entity in the MS shall initiate the establishment by
transmitting an SABM command with the P bit set to \"1\". The SABM
command shall contain the layer 3 message unit received in the
DL‑ESTABLISH‑REQUEST primitive and the length indicator, L, shall be set
to the appropriate value.

NOTE 1: According to sub-clause 9, the contention resolution procedure
is only permitted with SAPI value 0.

The information field of the SABM command shall be stored in the data
link layer entity of the MS. The information field is removed when the
data link layer enters the multiple frame established state or the idle
state, see below.

All existing exception conditions shall be cleared, the retransmission
counter shall be reset, and timer T200 shall be set when right before
transmitting a frame, when the PH‑READY‑TO‑SEND primitive is received
from the physical layer.

The peer data link layer entity in the BS receiving the SABM shall, if
the entity is in the idle state and an \"establishment in progress\"
flag has not been set:

‑ set the \"establishment in progress\" flag;

‑ store the information field received in the SABM command;

‑ respond, at the earliest possible opportunity, with a UA response
with:

\- the same SAPI value as received in the SABM command;

\- the F bit set to the same binary value as the P bit received in the
SABM command;

\- the length indicator, L, set to the same value as that contained in
the SABM command;

\- the same information field as that contained in the SABM command;

‑ set the send state variable V(S), the receive state variable V(R) and
the acknowledge state variable V(A) to 0;

‑ enter the \"contention resolution receiver\" state and inform the
layer 3 entity using the DL‑ESTABLISH‑ INDICATION primitive. The
primitive shall contain the received layer 3 message unit;

‑ clear all existing exception conditions.

If an SABM command with an information field is received when the
\"establishment in progress\" flag has been set, the data link layer
entity in the BS shall compare the stored information field with the
information field received in the SABM command. If they are not
identical, the SABM command shall be ignored without any notification.
If they are identical, the data link entity shall respond, at the
earliest possible opportunity, with a UA response with:

‑ the same SAPI value as received in the SABM command;

‑ the F bit set to the same binary value as the P bit contained in the
SABM command;

‑ the length indicator, L, set to the same value as that contained in
the SABM command;

‑ the stored information field.

NOTE 2: This case corresponds to a retransmission of the SABM command by
the MS (see sub-clause 8.4.1.5).

NOTE 3: The specification is very different from the normal
establishment procedure: in the latter case the reception of a
subsequent SABM frame triggers a re‑establishment (see sub-clause 8.6).

The data link layer entity in the BS shall remove the \"establishment in
progress\" flag and delete the stored information field when:

‑ an I frame or supervisory frame is received. If the frame is in
sequence, the data link layer entity shall enter the multiple frame
established state and process the frame as specified for operation in
the multiple frame established state. If the frame is out of sequence,
the BS shall initiate abnormal release using the procedure of sub-clause
8.6;

‑ a release request is received from layer 3. In this case the data link
layer entity shall enter the idle state if the primitive received is
DL‑RELEASE‑REQUEST or the null state if the primitive is
MDL‑RELEASE‑REQUEST.

The procedure when awaiting acknowledgement in the MS is as follows:

Upon reception of a UA response containing an information field and with
the F bit set to \"1\", the data link layer entity in the MS shall
compare the stored information field with the information field received
in the UA response. If the two fields are identical, the data link layer
entity shall:

‑ reset timer T200;

‑ set the send state variable V(S), the receive state variable V(R) and
the acknowledge state variable V(A) to 0;

‑ delete the stored information field;

‑ enter the multiple‑frame‑established state and inform the layer 3
entity using the DL‑ESTABLISH‑CONFIRM primitive.

If the two fields are different, the data link layer entity shall:

‑ reset timer T200;

‑ delete the stored information field;

‑ enter the idle state and inform the layer 3 entity using the
DL‑RELEASE‑INDICATION primitive.

All frames other than unnumbered frame formats received for the SAPI in
use during the establishment procedures shall be ignored.

The reception of unnumbered frames other than UA is treated as specified
for the normal establishment case.

NOTE 4: In fact, there are no foreseen cases in which the network will
send SABM, DISC or DM, but for sake of completeness these occurrences
are specified and must be treated.

#### 8.4.1.5 Procedure on expiry of timer T200: contention resolution (MS only)

If timer T200 expires before a UA response has been received, the data
link layer entity shall:

‑ retransmit the SABM command as in sub-clause 8.4.1.4;

‑ set timer T200 right before transmitting a frame, when the
PH‑READY‑TO‑SEND primitive is received from the physical layer; and

‑ increment the retransmission counter by 1.

After retransmission of the SABM command N200 times, the data link layer
shall enter the idle state and issue a DL‑ RELEASE‑INDICATION primitive
to the layer 3 entity. Layer 3 shall also be notified by using the
primitive MDL‑ERROR‑ INDICATION with cause \"timer T200 expired N200 + 1
times: perform abnormal release\".

### 8.4.2 Information transfer

#### 8.4.2.1 General requirements

Having either transmitted the UA response to a received SABM command or
received the UA response to a transmitted SABM command, I frames and
supervisory frames shall be transmitted and received according to the
procedures described in sub-clause 8.5.

If an SABM command is received while in the multiple‑frame‑established
state, the data link layer entity shall proceed as follows:

‑ if the SABM command carries no information field (i.e. L=0), then the
data link layer entity shall conform to the re‑establishment procedure
described in sub-clause 8.6;

‑ if the SABM command carries an information field (i.e. L\>0), and can
be considered as a part of a contention resolution procedure, then the
SABM command shall be ignored without any notification;

‑ otherwise, the SABM command shall be ignored, and the layer 3 shall be
informed by issuing a MDL‑ERROR‑INDICATION indicating \"SABM command
with information field not allowed in this state\" or \"U frame with
incorrect parameters\".

On receipt of a UI command, the procedures defined in sub-clause 8.3
shall be followed.

#### 8.4.2.2 Error conditions

Error conditions which will require abnormal release of the data link
are given in sub-clause 8.6.

Cases which do not lead to release but may cause the data link layer
entity to issue an MDL‑ERROR‑INDICATION are summarized in table 7.

  ----------------------- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### 8.4.2.3 Fill frames

In periods where no other frames are scheduled for transmission and
something must be sent on the radio path, a fill frame as defined below
shall be sent (3GPP TS 44.018 and 3GPP TS 45.002 prohibit such periods
for PCH and BCCH).

On a DCCH, a fill frame is a UI command frame for SAPI 0 with P=0 and
with an information field of 0 octet length (hence, it is a frame of
type A). It has the following structure:

  ----- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---------- ----------
  Bit   8   7   6   5   4   3   2   1              
        0   0   0   0   0   0   C   1   1          (note 1)
        0   0   0   0   0   0   1   1   2          
        0   0   0   0   0   0   0   1   3          
        X   X   X   X   X   X   X   X   4          (note 2)
                                                   
                                                   
                                                   
        X   X   X   X   X   X   X   X   21 or 23   (note 2)
  ----- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---------- ----------

NOTE 1: Bit C is set to:\
0 if sent by MS\
1 if sent by network.

NOTE 2: See sub-clause 5.2.

Fill frame for a BCCH, PCH, AGCH, or NCH is the following:

  ----- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---- --------
  Bit   8   7   6   5   4   3   2   1        
        0   0   0   0   0   0   0   1   1    
        0   0   1   0   1   0   1   1   2    (note)
                                             
                                             
                                             
        0   0   1   0   1   0   1   1   23   (note)
  ----- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---- --------

NOTE: The value \"00101011\" is chosen due to the modulation and
interleaving scheme used in the GSM system.

### 8.4.3 Suspension and resumption of multiple frame operation

#### 8.4.3.1 General

These procedures shall be used in a MS entity to suspend the uplink
multiple frame operation for SAPI=0 during a change of dedicated
channels (dedicated channel assignment or handover procedure on layer 3)
and to resume the operation after the new physical channel has been
connected. The purpose of these procedures is to provide a mechanism for
reliably avoiding message loss during a change of dedicated channels.
The procedures are only described for the case where the window size is
one; it should, however, be obvious how to adapt them to larger window
sizes.

As the procedures may delay the actual channel change, they shall only
be used to protect layer 3 messages pertaining to SAPI=0. Applications
using the multiple frame established service on SAPIs other than 0 are
expected to cope with message loss or duplication autonomously, i.e. on
layers above layer 2.

Both layer 3 procedures, dedicated channel assignment and handover, are
initiated and controlled by a network entity (BSS or MSC). This entity
therefore will suspend the flow of layer 3 messages towards the MS after
the ASSIGNMENT or HANDOVER COMMAND message has been issued. When the
data link on the new channel has been established, the message flow may
resume. Obviously, no provisions in layer 2 are needed on the network
side to prevent message loss or duplication on the downlink during
channel change.

In the following, the procedures in the MS are described. For the
description of the procedures, a conceptual configuration of a send
queue, a send buffer and a transmit buffer are assumed.

In order to ease the description of the procedures in the MS, it is
assumed that any layer 3 message passed to layer 2 via SAPI 0 in
DL‑DATA‑REQUEST or DL‑UNIT‑DATA primitive is first placed in the send
queue. The layer 2 entity will take out the messages \"first in‑first
out\" and put them into a send buffer. The send buffer can hold no more
than one layer 3 message at a time. From the contents of the send
buffer, an I frame or UI frame is constructed, only one at a time, and
placed in a transmit buffer. (If the layer 3 message needs to be
segmented, then this last step will be performed several times). The
frame is then transmitted.

Upon transmission and after it has been acknowledged if it has been an
I frame, the transmit buffer is cleared and filled with the next frame.
When the contents of the send buffer have been transmitted and
acknowledged, the send buffer is cleared and filled with the next
layer 3 message from the send queue.

#### 8.4.3.2 Suspension

A layer 3 entity in the MS shall indicate a request for the suspension
of multiple frame operation by use of the DL‑SUSPEND‑REQUEST primitive.
The layer 2 entity, upon receipt of this primitive, shall act as
follows:

No further layer 3 messages shall be taken from the send queue for
SAPI=0.

‑ If there is a layer 3 message in the send buffer which has not yet
been transmitted, it shall not be transmitted. The contents of the send
buffer shall be put back to the first position of the send queue. The
send and transmit buffers shall be cleared. A layer 3 message is
considered to be transmitted as soon as its final segment has been
transmitted at least once; it need not yet have been acknowledged. (This
ensures that all segments of a segmented and possibly partly transmitted
layer 3 message will be transmitted on the new channel. Those segments
already transmitted and received on the network side will be discarded
by the network upon release of the old channel because the layer 3
message is not yet complete).

‑ If there is a layer 3 message in the send buffer, the last segment of
which has been transmitted but is not yet fully acknowledged, i.e. the
frame carrying the last segment of the message has been transmitted but
is not yet acknowledged, then the contents of the send buffer shall be
put back to the first position of the send queue and the send and
transmit buffers shall be cleared.

‑ The layer 2 entity shall then return a DL‑SUSPEND‑CONFIRM primitive to
layer 3.

The data link layer entity is now in the suspended state. the only
difference to the multiple frame established state is that no UI frames
and no I frames are transmitted (all SAPIs).

The MS may now change to the new channel.

#### 8.4.3.3 Resumption

##### 8.4.3.3.1 Procedure after channel change

This procedure is initiated by the DL‑RESUME primitive. A data link
layer entity shall initiate a request for the multiple frame operation
by transmitting the SABM command.

All existing exception conditions shall be cleared and the
retransmission counter shall be reset. All outstanding DL‑DATA‑ REQUEST
primitives and layer 3 message units, which are not fully acknowledged,
shall be saved. Any segmented layer 3 message unit, for which the last
segment has not been received shall be discarded.

The send buffer is cleared.

A layer 3 message included in the DL‑RESUME‑REQUEST primitive (in
general, ASSIGNMENT COMPLETE or HANDOVER COMPLETE) is put into the send
buffer for transmission in acknowledged mode.

Upon reception of UA response the data link layer shall:

‑ reset T200;

‑ set send variable V(S), the receive state variable V(R) and the
acknowledge state variable V(A) to 0;

‑ enter the multiple established state;

‑ confirm establishment to layer 3 using DL‑ESTABLISH‑CONFIRM;

‑ send the layer 3 message unit passed together with the DL‑RESUME
primitive.

The data link layer shall then continue normal operation.

##### 8.4.3.3.2 Procedure after returning to the old channel (MS only)

This procedure is initiated by the DL‑RECONNECT primitive. A data link
layer entity shall initiate a request for the multiple frame operation
by transmitting the SABM command. All existing exception conditions
shall be cleared and the retransmission counter shall be reset. All
outstanding DL‑DATA‑REQUEST primitives and layer 3 message units, which
are not fully acknowledged, shall be saved; this does not include a
message carried by a possible previous DL‑RESUME‑REQUEST. Any segmented
layer 3 message units, for which the last segment has not been received
shall be discarded.

The send buffer is cleared.

A layer 3 message included in the DL‑RECONNECT‑REQUEST primitive (in
general, ASSIGNMENT FAILURE or HANDOVER FAILURE) is put into the send
buffer for transmission in acknowledge mode.

Upon reception of a UA response the data link layer shall:

‑ reset T200;

‑ set send state variable V(S), the receive state variable V(R) and the
acknowledge state variable V(A) to 0;

‑ enter the multiple frame established state;

‑ confirm establishment to layer 3 using DL‑ESTABLISH‑CONFIRM;

‑ send the layer 3 message unit passed together with
DL‑RECONNECT‑REQUEST primitive.

The data link layer shall then continue normal operation.

### 8.4.4 Termination of multiple frame operation

#### 8.4.4.1 General

These procedures shall be used to terminate the multiple frame operation
between the BS and a designated MS entity.

A layer 3 entity shall indicate a request for termination of the
multiple frame operation by use of the DL‑RELEASE‑ REQUEST primitive.
The DL‑RELEASE‑REQUEST primitive will contain a parameter indicating
whether normal release or local end release shall take place. In the
first case the data link layer will initiate the release procedure of
sub-clause 8.4.4.2. In the second case the data link layer shall follow
the procedures of sub-clause 8.4.4.4.

If a physical channel is disconnected at the physical layer, layer 3
will request release (i e local end release) by issuing an
MDL‑RELEASE‑REQUEST primitive. The actions to be taken are defined in
sub-clause 8.4.4.4.

All frames other than unnumbered frames received during the release
procedure shall be ignored.

For normal release the release procedure implies the discard of any
outstanding DL‑DATA‑REQUEST primitive which has been invoked prior to
the DL‑RELEASE‑REQUEST. It also implies the discard of any segmented
layer 3 data units for which the last segment has not been received (see
sub-clause 8.5.2 for the concatenation procedure).

#### 8.4.4.2 Normal release procedure

A data link layer entity shall initiate a request for release of
multiple frame operation by transmitting the Disconnect (DISC) command
with the P bit set to \"1\". Timer T200 shall then be set right before
transmitting a frame, when the PH‑READY‑TO‑SEND primitive is received
from the physical layer. The retransmission counter shall be set to
\"0\" (RC=0).

A data link layer entity receiving a DISC command while in the
multiple‑frame‑established state or timer recovery state shall transmit
a UA response with the F bit set to the same binary value as the P bit
in the received DISC command. A DL‑RELEASE‑INDICATION shall be passed to
layer 3, timer T200 shall be reset and the idle state shall be entered.

If the originator of the DISC command receives either:

‑ a UA response with the F bit set to \"1\"; or

‑ a DM response with F bit set to \"1\", indicating that the peer data
link layer entity was in the idle state, it shall reset timer T200 and
inform the layer 3 entity using the primitive DL‑RELEASE‑CONFIRM.

The data link layer entity which issued the DISC command will now be in
the idle state. The conditions relating to this state are defined in
sub-clause 8.4.5.

The DL‑RELEASE‑INDICATION or ‑ CONFIRM primitives shall contain an
indication whether or not there are outstanding acknowledgements or
unserved DL‑DATA‑REQUEST primitives.

#### 8.4.4.3 Procedure on expiry of timer T200 for normal release

If timer T200 expires before a UA or DM response is received, the
originator of the DISC command shall:

‑ retransmit the DISC command as defined in sub-clause 8.4.4.2;

‑ set timer T200 right before transmitting a frame, when the
PH‑READY‑TO‑SEND primitive is received from the physical layer; and

‑ increment the retransmission counter.

If the data link layer entity has not received the correct response as
defined in sub-clause 8.4.4.2, after N200 attempts to recover, the data
link layer entity shall enter the idle state and inform the layer 3
entity using the primitive DL‑ RELEASE‑CONFIRM and MDL‑ERROR‑IND with
cause \"Timer T200 expired (N200+1) times: perform abnormal release\".

The value of N200 is defined in sub-clause 8.8.2.

#### 8.4.4.4 Local end release procedure

When receiving a DL‑RELEASE‑REQUEST primitive from layer 3 with the
release mode parameter set to \"local end release\", the data link layer
shall in all states:

‑ return a DL‑RELEASE‑CONFIRM primitive;

‑ enter the idle state without issuing any commands to the peer entity.

The DL‑RELEASE‑CONFIRM primitive shall contain an indication whether or
not there are outstanding acknowledgements or unserved DL‑DATA‑REQUEST
primitives.

When receiving an MDL‑RELEASE‑REQUEST primitive, the data link layer
entity, when in the idle state, shall enter the null state. In all other
states the data link layer shall:

‑ if there is no outstanding DL‑RELEASE‑REQUEST primitive, issue a
DL‑RELEASE‑INDICATION primitive to layer 3;

‑ if there is an outstanding DL‑RELEASE‑REQUEST primitive, issue a
DL‑RELEASE‑CONFIRM primitive to layer 3;

‑ enter the null state without issuing any commands to the peer entity.

NOTE: The null state is the state, as viewed from the data link layer,
where no physical resource exists for the specific data link layer
entity.

### 8.4.5 Idle state

While in the idle state:

‑ the receipt of a DISC command shall result in the transmission of a DM
response with the F bit set to the value of the received P bit;

‑ the receipt of an I frame or supervisory frame with the P bit set to
\"1\" shall result in the transmission of a DM response with the F bit
set to \"1\" (as defined in sub-clause 8.2.2);

‑ the content of any received I frame shall be discarded;

‑ on receipt of an SABM command, the procedures defined in sub-clause
8.4.1 shall be followed;

‑ on receipt of UI commands, the procedures defined in sub-clause 8.3
shall be followed;

‑ all other frame types shall be discarded.

### 8.4.6 Collision of unnumbered commands and responses

Collision situations shall be resolved in the following way:

#### 8.4.6.1 Identical transmitted and received commands

If the transmitted and received unnumbered commands (SABM or DISC) are
the same, the data link layer entities shall send the UA response at the
earliest possible opportunity. The indicated state shall be entered
after receiving the UA response. The data link layer entities shall each
notify its respective layer 3 entity by means of the appropriate confirm
primitive, i.e. DL‑ESTABLISH‑CONFIRM or DL‑RELEASE‑CONFIRM.

#### 8.4.6.2 Different transmitted and received commands

If the transmitted and received unnumbered commands (SABM or DISC) are
different, the data link layer entities shall issue a DM response at the
earliest possible opportunity. Upon receipt of a DM response with the F
bit set to 1, the data link layer shall enter the idle state and notify
layer 3 by means of the appropriate primitive. The entity receiving the
DISC command will issue a DL‑RELEASE‑INDICATION primitive, while the
other entity will issue a DL‑RELEASE‑CONFIRM primitive.

Timer T200 shall be reset.

#### 8.4.6.3 Unsolicited DM response and SABM or DISC command

In order to avoid misinterpretation of the DM response received, a data
link layer entity shall always send its SABM or DISC command with the P
bit set to \"1\".

A DM response with the F bit set to \"0\" colliding with the SABM or
DISC command shall be ignored.

8.5 Procedures for information transfer in multiple frame operation
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The procedures which apply to the transmission of I frames are defined
below.

NOTE: The term \"transmission of an I frame\" refers to the delivery of
an I frame by the data link layer to the physical layer.

### 8.5.1 Transmitting I frames

Information received by the data link layer entity from a layer 3 entity
by means of a DL‑DATA‑REQUEST primitive shall be transmitted in one or
more I frames. If the layer 3 message unit consists of N201 or fewer
octets, the message unit is to be contained in one I frame. The M bit of
6.7.2 shall be set to \"0\" in such I frames. If the layer 3 message
unit exceeds N201 octets, the data link layer shall segment the message
unit in such a way that all segments, possibly except the last segment,
consist of N201 octets.

The M bit of sub-clause 6.7.2 shall be set to \"1\" for each segment
except for the last segment for which the M bit shall be set to \"0\".

The parameter N201 is defined in sub-clause 8.8.3.

When transmitting an I frame, the control field parameters N(S) and N(R)
shall be assigned the values of the send and receive state variables
V(S) and V(R), respectively. The value of the send state variable V(S)
shall be incremented by 1 at the end of the transmission of the I frame.

If timer T200 is not running at the time right before transmitting a
frame, when the PH‑READY‑TO‑SEND primitive is received from the physical
layer., it shall be set. If timer T200 expires, the procedures defined
in sub-clause 8.5.7 shall be followed.

If the send state variable V(S) is equal to V(A) plus k (where k is the
maximum number of outstanding I frames ‑ see sub-clause 8.8.4), the data
link layer entity shall not transmit any new I frames, but shall
retransmit an I frame as a result of the error recovery procedures as
described in sub-clauses 8.5.4 and 8.5.7.

When the BS side or MS side is in the own receiver busy (note 2)
condition, it may still transmit I frames, provided that a peer receiver
busy condition does not exist.

NOTE 1: Any DL‑DATA‑REQUEST primitive received while in the timer
recovery condition shall be stored and serviced on clearance of this
condition.

NOTE 2: In the following text in the present document, the term own/peer
receiver busy refers to the peer‑to‑ peer flow control state in the data
link layer entities.

### 8.5.2 Receiving I frames

When a data link layer entity is not in an own receiver busy condition
and receives a valid I frame whose send sequence number is equal to the
current receive state variable V(R), the data link layer entity shall:

‑ if the M bit is set to \"0\", concatenate it with previously received
frames with the M bit set to \"1\", if any, and pass the complete
layer 3 message unit to the layer 3 entity using the primitive
DL‑DATA‑INDICATION;

‑ if the M bit is set to \"1\", store the information field of the frame
and concatenate it with previously received frames with the M bit set to
\"1\", if any (Note: no information is passed to the layer 3 entity);

‑ increment by 1 its receive state variable V(R), and act as indicated
below.

NOTE: The M bit is defined in sub-clause 6.7.2.

#### 8.5.2.1 P bit of the received I frame set to \"1\"

If the P bit of the received I frame was set to \"1\", the data link
layer entity shall respond to its peer in one of the following ways:

‑ if the data link layer entity receiving the I frame is still not in an
own receiver busy condition, it shall send an RR response with the F bit
set to \"1\";

‑ if the data link layer entity receiving the I frame enters the own
receiver busy condition upon the receipt of the I frame, it shall send
an RNR response with the F bit set to \"1\".

#### 8.5.2.2 P bit of the received I frame set to \"0\"

If the P bit of the received I frame was set to \"0\" and:

a\) if the data link layer entity is still not in an own receiver busy
condition:

‑ if no I frame is available for transmission or if an I frame is
available for transmission but a peer receiver busy condition exists,
the data link layer entity shall transmit an RR response with the F bit
set to \"0\"; or

‑ if an I frame is available for transmission and no peer receiver busy
condition exists, the data link layer entity shall transmit the I frame
with the value of N(R) set to the current value of V(R) as defined in
sub-clause 8.5.1 (this I frame then acknowledges the receipt of an
I frame); or

b\) if, on receipt of this I frame, the data link layer entity is now in
an own receiver busy condition, it shall transmit an RNR response with
the F bit set to \"0\".

When the data link layer entity is in an own receiver busy condition, it
shall process any received I frame according to sub-clause 8.5.6.

NOTE 1: The term \"available for transmission\" should be interpreted to
mean available for transmission at the instant when the physical layer
is ready to transmit the next frame. Making this decision as close as
possible to that instant, will ensure minimum delay in the transmission
of I frames.

NOTE 2: Any I frame received in the timer recovery condition shall be
handled as stated above.

### 8.5.3 Receiving acknowledgement

#### 8.5.3.1 On receipt of a valid I frame

On receipt of a valid I frame or supervisory frame (RR, RNR or REJ),
even in the own receiver busy or timer recovery conditions, the data
link layer entity shall treat the N(R) contained in this frame as an
acknowledgement for all the I frames it has transmitted with an N(S) up
to and including the received N(R) ‑ 1. The value of the acknowledge
state variable V(A) shall be set to the value of N(R). When not in the
timer recovery condition, the data link layer entity shall reset the
timer T200 on receipt of a valid I frame or supervisory frame with N(R)
higher than V(A) (actually acknowledging some I frames), or an REJ with
an N(R) equal to V(A).

NOTE 1: If a supervisory command frame with P bit set to \"1\" or an
I frame command with P bit set to \"1\" has been transmitted and not
acknowledged, by a supervisory frame response with F bit set to \"1\"
timer T200 shall not be reset.

NOTE 2: Upon the receipt of a valid I frame, timer T200 shall not be
reset if the data link layer entity is in the peer receiver busy
condition.

If timer T200 has been reset by the receipt of an I, RR or RNR frame,
and if there are outstanding I frames still unacknowledged, the data
link layer entity shall set timer T200. If timer T200 then expires, the
data link layer entity shall follow the recovery procedure as defined in
sub-clause 8.5.7 with respect to the unacknowledged I frames.

If timer T200 has been reset by the receipt of an REJ frame, the data
link layer entity shall follow the retransmission procedures in
sub-clause 8.5.4.

#### 8.5.3.2 Receiving supervisory command frames with the P bit set to \"1\"

When receiving supervisory command frames with the P bit set to \"1\",
the following responses with the F bit set to \"1\" shall be given:

‑ if the data link layer entity is neither in an own receiver busy
condition nor in an N(S) sequence error exception condition, the
appropriate supervisory response is the RR response;

‑ if the data link layer entity is not in an own receiver busy
condition, but is in an N(S) sequence error exception condition (i e an
N(S) sequence error has been detected but a REJ frame has not yet been
transmitted), the appropriate supervisory response is the REJ response;

‑ if the data link layer is in its own receiver busy condition, the
appropriate supervisory response is the RNR response.

### 8.5.4 Receiving REJ frames

#### 8.5.4.1 Receipt of a valid REJ frame

On receipt of a valid REJ frame the data link layer entity shall act as
follows:

i\) if it is not in the timer recovery condition:

‑ clear an existing peer receiver busy condition;

‑ set its send state variable V(S) and its acknowledge state variable
V(A) to the value of the N(R) contained in the REJ frame control field;

‑ reset timer T200;

‑ if it was an REJ command frame with the P bit set to \"1\", transmit
an appropriate supervisory frame with the F bit set to \"1\" (see
sub-clause 8.5.3.2);

‑ transmit the corresponding I frame as soon as possible as defined in
sub-clause 8.5.1 taking into account the conditions given in sub-clause
8.5.4.2;

‑ if it was an REJ response frame with the F bit set to \"1\", notify a
protocol violation to layer 3 by means of the MDL‑ERROR‑INDICATION
primitive (cause: unsolicited supervisory response);

ii\) if it is in a timer recovery condition and it was an REJ response
frame with the F bit set to \"1\":

‑ clear an existing peer receiver busy condition;

‑ clear the timer recovery condition;

‑ set its send state variable V(S) and its acknowledge state variable
V(A) to the value of the N(R) contained in the REJ frame control field;

‑ reset timer T200;

‑ transmit the corresponding I frame as soon as possible as defined in
sub-clause 8.5.1 taking into account the conditions given in sub-clause
8.5.4.2;

iii\) if it is in a timer recovery condition and it was an REJ frame
other than an REJ response with the F bit set to \"1\":

‑ clear an existing peer receiver busy condition;

‑ set its acknowledge state variable V(A) to the value of the N(R)
contained in the REJ frame control field; and

‑ if it was an REJ command frame with the P bit set to \"1\", transmit
an appropriate supervisory response frame with the F bit set to \"1\"
(see sub-clause 8.5.3.2).

If the network receives a valid REJ frame following the application of
the *Repeated Downlink FACCH* functionality (see sub-clause 10), and if
it can be established that this frame is resulting from the reception of
a repeated FACCH block by the Mobile Station , then this REJ frame may
be ignored by the network.

NOTE: This case could typically occur when *Repeated Downlink FACCH* is
used toward a Mobile Station not supporting the functionality (i.e. a
pre-Release 6 Mobile Station).

#### 8.5.4.2 Transmitting frames

When transmitting frames the following conditions are to be observed:

1\) if the data link layer entity is transmitting a supervisory frame
when it receives the REJ frame, it shall complete that transmission
before commencing transmission of the requested I frame;

2\) if the data link layer entity is transmitting an SABM or DISC
command or a UA or DM response when it receives the REJ frame, it shall
ignore the request for retransmission;

3\) if the data link layer entity is not transmitting a frame when the
REJ is received, it shall immediately commence transmission of the
requested I frame.

All outstanding unacknowledged I frames, commencing with the I frame
identified in the received REJ frame, shall be transmitted. Other
I frames not yet transmitted may be transmitted following the
transmitted I frames.

### 8.5.5 Receiving RNR frame

After receiving a valid RNR command or response, provided that the data
link layer entity is not engaged in a mode setting operation, the data
link layer entity shall set a peer receiver busy condition.

For RNR commands/responses with the P/F bit set to 1, the following
special conditions apply:

‑ if it was an RNR command with the P bit set to \"1\", it shall respond
with an RR response with the F bit set to \"1\" if the data link layer
entity is not in an own receiver busy condition, and shall respond with
an RNR response with the F bit set to \"1\" if the data link layer
entity is in an own receiver busy condition;

‑ if it was an RNR response with the F bit set to \"1\" and timer
recovery condition exists, the timer recovery condition shall be cleared
and the N(R) contained in this RNR response shall be used to update the
send state variable V(S).

The data link layer entity shall take note of the peer receiver busy
condition and not transmit any I frame towards the peer having indicated
a busy condition.

NOTE 1: This condition may not apply if the protocol operation on SAPI=0
and SAPI=3 is implemented (see sub-clause 9).

NOTE 2: The N(R) in any received supervisory command, irrespective of
the setting of the P bit, will not be used to update the send state
variable V(S).

The data link layer entity shall then:

‑ treat the receive sequence number N(R) contained in the received
RNR frame as an acknowledgement for all the I frames that have been
transmitted or retransmitted with an N(S) up to and including N(R) ‑1,
and set its acknowledge state variable V(A) to the value of the N(R)
contained in the RNR frame; and

‑ set timer T200 unless a supervisory response frame with the F bit set
to \"1\" is still expected.

If timer T200 expires, the data link layer entity shall:

‑ if it is not yet in a timer recovery condition, enter a timer recovery
condition, and set the retransmission count variable to 0;

‑ if it is already in a timer recovery condition, add one to its
retransmission count variable.

The data link layer entity shall then:

‑ if the value of the retransmission count variable is less than N200,
transmit an appropriate supervisory command (see sub-clause 8.5.3.2)
with the P bit set to \"1\", and set timer T200 right before
transmitting a frame, when the PH‑READY‑TO‑SEND primitive is received
from the physical layer; or

‑ if the value of the retransmission count variable is equal to N200, it
shall initiate the abnormal release procedure described in sub-clause
8.6. Layer 3 shall be notified via the MDL‑ERROR‑INDICATION primitive
with cause \"timer T200 expired N200 + 1 times: perform abnormal
release\".

The peer data link layer entity receiving the supervisory frame with the
P bit set to \"1\" shall respond, at the earliest opportunity, with the
appropriate supervisory response frame (see sub-clause 8.5.3.2) with the
F bit set to \"1\", to indicate whether or not its own receiver busy
condition still exists.

Upon receipt of the supervisory response with the F bit set to \"1\",
the data link layer entity shall reset timer T200, and:

‑ if the response is an RR or REJ response, the peer receiver busy
condition is cleared and the data link layer entity may transmit new
I frames or retransmit I frames as defined in sub-clauses 8.5.1 or
8.5.4, respectively; or

‑ if the response is an RNR response, the data link layer entity
receiving the response shall proceed according to sub-clause 8.5.5,
first paragraph.

If a supervisory command (RR, RNR or REJ) with the P bit set to \"0\" or
\"1\", or a supervisory response frame with the F bit set to \"0\" is
received during the enquiry process, the data link layer entity shall:

‑ if the supervisory frame is an RR or REJ command or response frame
with the F bit set to \"0\", clear the peer receiver busy condition and
if the supervisory frame was a command with the P bit set to \"1\",
transmit the appropriate supervisory response (see sub-clause 8.5.3.2)
frame with the F bit set to \"1\". However, the transmission or
retransmission of I frames shall not be undertaken until the appropriate
supervisory response frame with the F bit set to \"1\" is received or
until the expiry of timer T200; or

‑ if the supervisory frame is an RNR command or an RNR response with the
P/F bit set to \"0\", retain the peer receiver busy condition, and if
the supervisory frame received was an RNR command with the P bit set to
\"1\", transmit the appropriate supervisory response (see sub-clause
8.5.3.2) with the F bit set to \"1\".

Receiving an SABM command, the data link layer entity shall clear the
peer receiver busy condition.

### 8.5.6 Data link layer own receiver busy condition

When the data link layer entity enters an own receiver busy condition,
it shall transmit an RNR frame at the earliest opportunity. The
RNR frame may be either:

‑ an RNR response with the F bit set to \"0\"; or

‑ if this condition is entered when receiving a command frame with the P
bit set to \"1\", an RNR response frame with the F bit set to \"1\"; or

‑ if this condition is entered on expiry of timer T200, an RNR command
with the P bit set to \"1\".

All received I frames with the P bit set to \"0\" shall be discarded,
after updating the acknowledge state variable V(A).

All received supervisory frames with the P/F bit set to \"0\" shall be
processed, including updating the acknowledge state variable V(A).

All received I frames with the P bit set to \"1\" shall be discarded,
after updating the acknowledge state variable V(A). However, an RNR
response frame with the F bit set to \"1\" shall be transmitted.

All received supervisory frames with the P bit set to \"1\" will be
processed including updating the acknowledge state variable V(A). An RNR
response with the F bit set to \"1\" shall be transmitted.

To indicate to the peer data link layer entity the clearance of the own
receiver busy condition, the data link layer entity shall transmit an
RR frame, or, if a previously detected N(S) sequence error has not yet
been reported, an REJ frame with the N(R) set to the current value of
the receive state variable V(R).

The transmission of an SABM command or a UA response (in reply to an
SABM command) also indicates to the peer data link layer entity the
clearance of the own receiver busy condition.

### 8.5.7 Waiting acknowledgement

The data link layer entity shall maintain an internal retransmission
count variable.

If timer T200 expires, the data link layer entity shall:

‑ if it is not yet in the timer recovery condition, enter the timer
recovery condition and set the retransmission count variable to 0; or

‑ if it is already in the timer recovery condition, add one to its
retransmission count variable.

The data link layer entity shall then:

a\) if the value of the retransmission count variable is less than N200:

‑ retransmit the last transmitted I frame (V(S)‑1) with the P bit set to
\"1\"; or

‑ send the appropriate supervision frame, with the P bit set to \"1\";

‑ set timer T200 right before transmitting a frame, when the
PH‑READY‑TO‑SEND primitive is received from the physical layer; or

b\) if the value of the retransmission count variable is equal to N200,
indicate this by means of the primitive MDL‑ERROR‑INDICATION with cause
\"timer T200 expired N200 + 1 times: perform abnormal release\" to
layer 3.

NOTE: It is then the responsibility of layer 3 to release or
re‑establish the data link. The data link layer remains in the timer
recovery state until further actions are taken by layer 3.

The following paragraph applies only for data link layer being in the
timer recovery condition as the case of receiving acknowledgement in
multiframe established state is described in sub-clause 8.5.3.1.

The timer recovery condition is only cleared if the data link layer
entity receives a valid supervisory frame response with the F bit set to
\"1\". If the N(R) of this received supervisory frame is within the
range from its current state variable V(A) to its current send state
variable V(S) inclusive, it shall set its send state variable V(S) to
the value of the received N(R). Timer T200 shall be reset if the
received supervisory frame response is an RR or REJ response with F bit
set to \"1\". The data link layer entity shall then resume with I frame
transmission or retransmission, as appropriate.

Timer T200 shall be set if the received supervisory response is an RNR
response, and the data link layer shall proceed with the enquiry process
in accordance with sub-clause 8.5.5.

### 8.5.8 Preemption

The preemption capability allows high priority layer 3 messages to avoid
significant queuing delay at layer 2 due to the transmission of
preceding low priority layer 3 messages.

#### 8.5.8.1 Sender Requirements

If higher layers do not send any message defined in 3GPP TS 44.018 to
have a \"low\" priority, the data link layer may treat all layer 3
messages as having \"normal\" priority. This provides backward
compatibility with previous versions of this standard.

For multiple frame operation on SAPI 0, the Layer 3 shall indicate the
priority of each message by providing a priority value in a
DL-DATA-REQUEST primitive. Layer 3 messages with a priority value of
\"high\" are allowed to preempt preceeding untransmitted and partially
transmitted layer 3 messages with a priority value of \"low\". Layer 3
messages with a priority value of \"normal\" shall neither preempt not
be preempted by other Layer 3 messages.

On receiving a DL-DATA-REQUEST carrying a Layer 3 message with a
\"high\" priority value, the data link layer entity shall discard all
preceding untransmitted Layer 3 messages using the same data link layer
connection (i.e. same SAPI and channel) that have a \'low\" priority
value. Layer 3 messages with a \"low\" priority value whose entire
contents have been transmitted, but for which acknowledgements are still
outstanding, shall not be affected. If there is any layer 3 message (at
most one) with a \"low\" priority value for which some but not all
octets were transmitted, the data link layer shall discard all
untransmitted octets following the first N201 untransmitted octets if
the total number of untransmitted octets exceeds N201. If there are N201
or fewer untransmitted octets, no data shall be discarded. When
untransmitted octets are discarded, the remaining N201 untransmitted
octets shall be transmitted when permitted by flow control in a single I
frame with the M bit set to \"0\".

Low priority data that is not discarded (i.e. previously transmitted but
unacknowledged data and up to N201 octets of untransmitted data) shall
be retransmitted if necessary until acknowledged by receiving data link
layer entity.

#### 8.5.8.2 Receiver Requirements

The receiving data link layer entity is not affected by, nor aware of,
preemption at a sender. Detection of and recovery from preemption is the
responsibility of the higher layers. The procedures employed at the data
link layer ensure that when a \"low\" priority message is truncated, at
least the first 2\*N201 octets are delivered reliably to the receiving
layer 3.

8.6 Abnormal release and re‑establishment of multiple frame operation
---------------------------------------------------------------------

### 8.6.1 Criteria for re‑establishment

The procedures for re‑establishing the multiple frame operation are
initiated by:

a\) the receipt of a DL‑ESTABLISH‑REQUEST;

b\) the receipt, while in the multiple frame established or timer
recovery state, of an SABM command.

### 8.6.2 Criteria for abnormal release

The procedures for abnormal release of the multiple frame operation are
initiated by:

a\) the receipt of a frame containing an invalid N(R) (see note);

b\) the receipt, while in the multiple‑frame‑established state, of an
unsolicited DM response with the F bit set to \"0\".

A valid N(R) is one that is in the range V(A)\<=N(R)\<=V(S).

NOTE: These inequalities shall be interpreted in the following way:\
N(R) is called valid, if and only if (N(R)‑V(A)) mod 8 \<= (V(S)‑V(A))
mod 8.

### 8.6.3 Procedures for re‑establishment

When the data link layer receives in the multiple frame established
state or timer recovery state a DL‑ESTABLISH‑ REQUEST primitive from
layer 3 or an SABM (with L=0), the normal establishment procedure of
sub-clause 8.4.1.2 shall be initiated. Any information frames in the I
queue (including I frames for DL‑DATA‑REQUEST primitives and any
received segmented layer 3 message units for which the last segment has
not been received) shall be discarded.

A DL‑ESTABLISH‑INDICATION or ‑CONFIRM primitive sent to layer 3 shall
contain an indication whether or not there are outstanding
acknowledgements or unserved DL‑DATA‑REQUEST primitives.

### 8.6.4 Procedures for abnormal release

The data link layer shall inform layer 3 that an exception condition
exists from which the data link layer cannot recover. The information is
provided in an MDL‑ERROR‑ INDICATION primitive with causes \"sequence
error: perform abnormal release\" or \"unsolicited DM response, multiple
frame established state: perform abnormal release\".

The release of the data link shall then be performed by layer 3 by
either of the following primitives:

‑ DL‑RELEASE‑REQUEST (release mode=normal release). Then the data link
layer shall follow the procedures of sub-clause 8.4.4.2.

‑ DL‑RELEASE‑REQUEST (release mode=local end release). Then the data
link layer shall follow the procedure of sub-clause 8.4.4.4.

‑ MDL‑RELEASE‑REQUEST. Then the data link layer shall follow the
procedure of sub-clause 8.4.4.4.

The data link layer shall remain in the same state (i e multiple frame
established or timer recovery) until the primitive is received.

8.7 Exception condition reporting and recovery for multiple frame operation
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Exception conditions may occur as the result of physical layer errors or
data link layer procedural errors.

The error recovery procedures which are available to effect recovery
following the detection of an exception condition at the data link layer
are defined in this sub-clause.

### 8.7.1 N(S) sequence error

An N(S) sequence error exception condition occurs in the receiver when a
valid I frame is received which contains an N(S) value which is not
equal to the receive state variable V(R) at the receiver. The
information field of all I frames whose N(S) does not equal the receive
state variable V(R) shall be discarded.

The receiver shall not acknowledge (nor increment its receive state
variable) the I frame causing the sequence error, nor any I frames which
may follow, until an I frame with the correct N(S) is received.

A data link layer entity which receives one or more I frames having
sequence errors but otherwise error‑free, or subsequent supervisory
frames (RR, RNR and REJ), shall use the control field information
contained in the N(R) field and the P or F bit to perform data link
control functions; for example, to receive acknowledgement of previously
transmitted I frames and to cause the data link layer entity to respond
if the P bit is set to \"1\". Therefore, a retransmitted I frame may
contain an N(R) field value and P bit that are updated from, and
therefore different from, the ones contained in the originally
transmitted I frame.

The REJ frame is used by a receiving data link layer entity to initiate
an exception condition recovery (retransmission) following the detection
of an N(S) sequence error.

Only one REJ exception condition for a given direction of information
transfer shall be established at a time.

A data link layer entity receiving an REJ command or response shall
initiate sequential transmission (retransmission) of I frames starting
with the I frame indicated by the N(R) contained in the REJ frame.

An REJ exception condition is cleared when the requested I frame is
receive or when an SABM or DISC command is received.

### 8.7.2 Timer recovery

If a data link layer entity, due to a transmission error, does not
receive a single I frame or the last I frame(s) in a sequence of
I frames, it will not detect an out‑of‑sequence exception condition and
therefore will not transmit a REJ frame.

The data link layer which transmitted the unacknowledged I frame(s)
shall, on the expiry of timer T200, take appropriate recovery action as
defined in sub-clause 8.5.7 to determine at which I frame retransmission
must begin.

### 8.7.3 Invalid frame condition

Any frame received which satisfies one or more of the following
conditions shall be discarded after notification to layer 3 by means of
the primitive MDL‑ERROR‑INDICATION (with cause as indicated):

‑ a supervisory or unnumbered frame with incorrect parameters (e g a
length indicator L\>0 in frames where an information field is not
permitted, an M bit set to \"1\", a length indicator set to L\>N201 in
frames permitted with an information field) (causes \"S frame with
incorrect parameters\" and \"U frame with incorrect parameters\",
respectively);

‑ an I frame with length indicator which indicates more than N201 octets
in the frame (cause \"I frame with incorrect length\");

‑ an I frame with the M bit set to \"1\" and the length indicator set to
less than N201 octets (cause \"I frame with incorrect use of M bit\");

‑ a command or response frame with a control field which is not
implemented (cause \"frame not implemented\").

No other action shall be taken as a result of such frames, i e
information fields shall be discarded and N(S) fields, N(R) fields and
P/F bits shall be ignored.

### 8.7.4 N(R) sequence error

An N(R) sequence error exception condition occurs in the transmitter
when a valid supervisory frame or I frame is received which contains an
invalid N(R) value.

A valid N(R) is one that is in the range V(A)=\<N(R)=\<V(S).

NOTE: These inequalities shall be interpreted in the following way:\
N(R) is called valid, if and only if (N(R)‑V(A)) mod 8 \<= (V(S)‑V(A))
mod 8.

The information field contained in an I frame which is correct in
sequence and format but contains an invalid N(R) shall be delivered to
layer 3 by means of the primitive DL‑ DATA‑INDICATION (if it contains a
complete layer 3 message unit or the last segment of a segmented layer 3
message unit; otherwise the information field is discarded) and a P bit
set to \"1\" shall be processed before taking subsequent actions.

The data link layer entity shall then inform layer 3 on this exception
condition by means of the primitive MDL‑ERROR‑ INDICATION with the cause
\"sequence error: perform abnormal release\", as defined in 8.6.4. The
data link shall remain in the current state until it is released by
layer 3.

8.8 List of system parameters
-----------------------------

The system parameters listed below are associated with each individual
service access point and apply to both unacknowledged operation and
multiple frame operation.

NOTE 1: The only parameter required for unacknowledged operation is the
maximum number of octets in the information field (sub-clause 8.8.3).

NOTE 2: The values given below for the parameters may be changed as a
result of optimization of the system performance.

### 8.8.1 Timer T200

#### 8.8.1.1 For SAPI=0 and SAPI=3

The exact value of timer T200 for data links with SAPI=0 and SAPI=3 is
implementation dependent. It depends on synchronization mechanisms and
processing delays both in layer 1 and layer 2 entities. Generally, it
shall be chosen such that a predictable behaviour at the Um reference
point can be guaranteed. The general principles for choosing a value for
timer T200 are:

‑ a possible loss of frames on the radio path should be detected as soon
as possible;

‑ a necessary retransmission of a frame should take place at the
earliest possible opportunity;

> \- the use of Repeated Downlink FACCH (see sub-clause 10);

‑ T200 shall not time out before the next frame in the other direction
is received and treated, assuming some reasonable response delays for
the peer entities (see sub-clause 8.9);

‑ if T200 times out, provided no other frame takes priority, the
repeated frame is sent in the block following immediately after the next
PH‑READY‑TO‑SEND indication.

Values of T200 shall be chosen implementation dependent for the various
types of channels according to the rules given above and the performance
requirements of sub-clause 8.9.

#### 8.8.1.2 For SAPIs other than 0 or 3

The value of timer T200 for data links with SAPIs other than 0 or 3 is
for further study.

### 8.8.2 Maximum number of retransmissions (N200)

#### 8.8.2.1 For SAPI=0 and 3

For SAPI=0 and 3, the maximum number of retransmissions N200 depends on
the state and on the channel used. This ensures a common time value for
layer 2 link failure on all channels when multiple frame operation is
established. The N200 value for layer 2 link establishment and release
is 5.

In the state \"timer recovery\", N200 is set to:

\- 5 for use on SACCH;

\- 23 for use on SDCCH;

\- 34 for use on FACCH/full rate (Note 1);

\- 48 for use on E‑FACCH/full rate;

\- 29 for use on FACCH/half rate.

NOTE 1: All types of FACCH/Full rate except E-FACCH/F.

#### 8.8.2.2 For SAPIs other than 0 or 3

For SAPIs other than 0 or 3, the value of N200 is 5.

### 8.8.3 Maximum number of octets in an I, UI, SABM and UA frame partially or entirely available for the information field (N201)

The maximum number of octets partially or entirely available for the
information field (N201) is:

\- for frames of format A and B:

‑ for the SACCH: N201 = 18;

‑ for the FACCH and SDCCH: N201 = 20.

\- for frames of format Bbis:

‑ for BCCH, AGCH, NCH and PCH: N201 = 23;

\- for frames of format Bter:

\- for the SACCH: N201 = 21;

\- for the FACCH and SDCCH: N201 = 23;

\- for frames of format B4:

\- for the SACCH: N201 = 19.

### 8.8.4 Maximum number of outstanding I frames (k)

The maximum number (k) of sequentially numbered I frames that may be
outstanding (that is, unacknowledged) at any given time is a system
parameter which shall not exceed 7.

For data links with SAPI=0 or 3 (see sub-clause 9), the value of k shall
be k = 1.

The value of k for other values of SAPI is for further study.

### 8.8.5 Maximum number of octets in a Layer 3 message

The number of octets in a L3‑message passed to layer 2 for transmission
in acknowledged mode shall not exceed 251, due to corresponding limits
in 3GPP TS 48.056.

The number of octets in a L3‑message passed to layer 2 for transmission
in unacknowledged mode is limited by the maximum number of octets in the
information field of an UI‑frame, as defined in sub-clause 8.8.3.

8.9 System performance requirements
-----------------------------------

An implementation of data link layer service for SAPI=0 and SAPI=3
consisting of a data link layer entity and an entity necessary for
physical transmission on the GSM radio channels, shall have sufficient
processing capacity to satisfy the following performance requirements.
Those requirements are to be satisfied by a local implementation without
reference to the (remote) peer implementation:

‑ Available response delay:

If a data link entity receives a data link command frame requesting
response whose last burst has been physically transmitted in the TDMA
frame number FNcomm, then the first burst carrying a segment of the
corresponding data link response shall be physically transmitted in the
TDMA frame number FNresp, where:

FNresp \<= FNcomm + Tresp +1;

and Tresp denotes the number of TDMA frames corresponding to the
available response delay for the logical channel in use, as indicated in
table 8. When Repeated Downlink FACCH is used (see clause 10) to send a
command frame, FNcomm denotes the TDMA frame number of the last burst of
the FACCH block used to recover the LAPDm frame. When Repeated Downlink
FACCH is used to send a response frame (see clause 10), FNresp denotes
the TDMA frame number of the first burst of the FACCH block used to send
the first instance of the repeated LAPDm frame.

‑ Observable repetition delay:

if a data link entity transmits a data link command frame whose first
burst is physically contained in the TDMA frame number FNcomm1, then in
case of retransmission the first burst carrying a segment of the
retransmitted data link command frame shall be contained in the TDMA
frame number FNcomm2 satisfying;

FNcomm1 + Trmin \<= FNcomm2 \<= FNcomm1 + Trmax;

where Trmin resp. Trmax denote the number of TDMA frames corresponding
to the minimum resp. maximum observable repetition delay for the logical
channel in use, as indicated in table 8. When Repeated Downlink FACCH is
used (see clause 10) to send a command frame, FNcomm1 denotes the TDMA
frame number of the first burst of the FACCH block used to send the
repeated LAPDm frame.

NOTE: Arithmetics on TDMA frame numbers as specified in 3GPP TS 45.002
operates modulo (FN\_MAX+1) = 2715648.

9 Special protocol operation on SAPI=0 and SAPI=3
=================================================

This sub-clause summarizes the specialities of the LAPDm protocol
regarding the acknowledged mode operation on SAPI=0 and SAPI=3.

The purpose is to adapt the multiple frame operation of LAPDm to the
needs and the characteristics of the GSM system.

The adaptations and simplifications specified in this sub-clause are
mandatory for both entities, Mobile Station and Network for SAPI=0 and
SAPI=3.

As indicated in sub-clause 8, the protocol operates on SAPI=0 in the
following way:

‑ Data link establishment for SAPI=0 is always initiated by the Mobile
Station.

‑ Data link establishment according to the contention resolution
procedure (see sub-clause 8.4.1.4) is supported when initiated by the MS
on the main DCCH immediately after \"immediate assignment\" of that
radio channel. In other cases of link establishment contention
resolution is not used.

‑ When changing the radio channel during assignment or handover
procedures (layer 3 procedures), in acknowledged mode on SAPI=0, the MS
supports continuous transmission of layer 3 messages without loss by
offering the SUSPEND, RESUME and RECONNECT primitives, as specified in
sub-clause 8.4.3. However, duplication of at most one layer 3 data unit
(in the MS to network direction) is possible.

For protocol operation on SAPI=0 as well as on SAPI=3 the following
holds:

‑ For multiple frame operation, the window size k = 1 shall be used.

‑ The data link layer entity is not allowed to transmit an RNR frame and
therefore shall never enter the own‑receiver busy state. The same
applies to the peer‑receiver‑busy condition. This is applicable, because
buffer capacities necessary for avoiding such exception conditions are
limited.

‑ When receiving, the data link layer entity may ignore RNR frames
without notification.

‑ The procedure of enquiring the peer entity status by spontaneous
transmission of a RR or REJ command frame, as indicated in sub-clauses
6.8.5 and 6.8.7, need not be supported. However, reaction on receiving
such frames shall be as specified throughout the present document.

10 Repeated Downlink FACCH 
==========================

10.1 General
------------

The Repeated Downlink FACCH functionality is applicable when sending
LAPDm frames on the TCH/F or TCH/H channel (excluding O-TCH and E-TCH
channels). An MS supporting the TCH/F or TCH/H, as described above,
shall support the Repeated Downlink FACCH functionality. The BSS may use
the Repeated Downlink FACCH functionality when it considers it to be
appropriate.

10.2 The FACCH Repetition
-------------------------

A repeated FACCH block shall be sent in such a way that, if the first
burst of the downlink FACCH block containing the first instance of a
LAPDm frame is sent in TDMA frame M, the first burst of the downlink
FACCH block containing the repeated instance of the LAPDm frame is sent
in TDMA frame M+8 or M+9 (the latter corresponding to the case where the
two FACCH blocks are separated by either a SACCH frame or an idle frame,
see 3GPP TS 45.002).

NOTE: On a channel using Repeated Downlink FACCH the value of T200
should be increased to cope with the case where the receiving entity
failed to decode the downlink FACCH block used to send the first
instance of a repeated LAPDm frame. This applies to a BSS supporting
Repeated Downlink FACCH and to an MS that has signalled the Repeated
ACCH Capability bit as \'1\' (see 3GPP TS 24.008).

10.3 BSS requirements
---------------------

The BSS may, based on implementation-dependent criteria (e.g. downlink
measurements), decide to repeat any downlink LAPDm command frame sent in
a FACCH block over the radio interface. If the MS has signalled the
Repeated ACCH Capability bit as \'1\' (see 3GPP TS 24.008), the BSS may
also, based on implementation-dependent criteria, decide to repeat any
downlink LAPDm response frame sent in a FACCH block over the radio
interface. In both cases, the repeated FACCH block shall be sent as
specified in sub-clause 10.2.

NOTE: If an MS has not signalled a Repeated ACCH Capability bit as \'1\'
the BSS may only use Repeated Downlink FACCH to send command frames.

10.4 MS requirements
--------------------

The MS shall, when receiving a downlink FACCH block, always attempt to
decode it without combining with any previously received FACCH block.

If the current FACCH block is successfully decoded and an identical
FACCH block was previously received (successfully decoded and spaced in
time from the current FACCH block as specified in sub-clause 10.2), the
MS shall not send the LAPDm frame of the current FACCH block to the
LAPDm entity.

If the current FACCH block is successfully decoded and there was no such
previously received identical FACCH block the LAPDm frame of the current
FACCH block is sent to the LAPDm entity.

If the current FACCH block is unsuccessfully decoded and there was an
unsuccessfully decoded FACCH block spaced in time from the current FACCH
block as specified in sub-clause 10.2, a new decoding using the
information from both these FACCH blocks shall be performed. If this
decoding is successful the LAPDm frame produced by the new decoding is
sent to the LAPDm entity.

11 Repeated SACCH 
=================

11.1 General
------------

The Repeated SACCH functionality is applicable when a layer 3 message
unit is to be sent or received in a SAPI=0 frame (i.e. in unacknowledged
mode) on the SACCH channel. The MS shall support the Repeated SACCH
functionality. The BSS may use the Repeated SACCH functionality when it
considers it to be appropriate.

11.2 Procedure for Repeated SACCH on the downlink
-------------------------------------------------

If a downlink SACCH block is incorrectly decoded (prior to combining
with any previously received SACCH block), and the next uplink SACCH
block is not a repetition as per the Repeated SACCH procedure (see
sub-clause 11.3), then the MS shall set the SACCH Repetition Request in
the next uplink SACCH block to \"Repeated SACCH required\" (see 3GPP TS
44.004). If a downlink SACCH block is correctly decoded (prior to
combining with any previously received SACCH block), and the next uplink
SACCH block is not a repetition as per the Repeated SACCH procedure (see
sub-clause 11.3), the MS shall set the SACCH Repetition Request in the
next uplink SACCH block to \"Repeated SACCHnot required\".

At the BSS side, if a transmitted downlink SACCH block contains a SAPI 0
frame and is not already a repetition, then it is a repetition
candidate. If a SACCH block is a repetition candidate then the BSS may,
based on the value of the last correctly received SACCH Repetition
Request from the MS, or based on implementation-dependent criteria,
repeat this SACCH block at the next SACCH period. If a SAPI 3 frame was
also scheduled to be sent at this next SACCH period, the BSS may delay
the sending of the SAPI 3 frame by one SACCH period in order to make
room for the repetition.

When receiving a downlink SACCH block, the MS shall first attempt to
decode it without combining with any previously received SACCH block. If
this decoding fails, then a new decoding using the information from this
SACCH block and from the SACCH block received at the previous SACCH
block period shall be performed.

11.3 Procedure for Repeated SACCH on the uplink
-----------------------------------------------

The BSS may set the value of the SACCH Repetition Order (see 3GPP TS
44.004) of any downlink SACCH block based on implementation-dependent
criteria.

At the MS side, if a transmitted uplink SACCH block contains a SAPI 0
frame and is not already a repetition, then it is a repetition
candidate. If a SACCH block is a repetition candidate and if the last
correctly received SACCH Repetition Order was set to \"Repeated SACCH
required\", then the MS shall repeat this SACCH block at the next SACCH
block period. If a SAPI 3 frame was also scheduled to be sent at this
next SACCH period, the MS shall delay the sending of the SAPI 3 frame by
one SACCH period in order to make room for the repetition.

When receiving an uplink SACCH block, the BSS may first attempt to
decode it without combining with any previously received SACCH block. If
this decoding fails, then a new decoding using the information from this
SACCH block and from the SACCH block received at the previous SACCH
block period may be performed.

######## Annex A (normative): Random access procedures

A.1 Description of the procedure
================================

A.1.1 Procedure in the MS
-------------------------

The random access procedure is initiated by layer 3. The data link layer
will receive the 8 bit information content of the random access burst in
a DL‑RANDOM ACCESS‑REQUEST primitive. The primitive will also contain an
indication of the type of channel to be used. The data link layer will
then pass the information field to the indicated physical layer entity
in a PH‑RANDOM ACCESS‑REQUEST primitive.

The physical layer will, upon sending the random access burst, send a
PH‑RANDOM ACCESS‑CONFIRM primitive containing the time slot in which the
burst was sent. This information is passed then to layer 3 in a
DL‑RANDOM ACCESS‑CONFIRM primitive.

A.1.2 Procedure in the BS
-------------------------

The physical layer will provide the random access information field and
an indication of the time slot in which the random access burst was
received to the data link layer in a PH‑RANDOM ACCESS‑INDICATION
primitive. The primitive will also contain an indication of the type of
channel on which the burst was received. The data link layer will pass
the information to layer 3 in a DL‑RANDOM‑ACCESS‑INDICATION primitive.

A.2 Format
==========

The format of the random access message at the data link layer consists
of 8 bits. The order of bit transmission is defined in 3GPP TS 44.004.

######## Annex G (normative): Handling of frames with parameter errors in the address, control and length indicator fields

G.1 General
===========

The parameters contained in frames received with parameter errors in the
address, control and length indicator fields shall be ignored and an
information field shall be discarded.

For some parameter errors an indication is given to the mobile
management entity in an MDL‑ERROR‑INDICATION primitive.

G.2 Parameter errors in the address field
=========================================

G.2.1 Unallocated SAPI
----------------------

No action shall be taken on frames containing an unallocated SAPI.

G.2.2 Wrong value of the C/R bit
--------------------------------

‑ I frame, C/R bit indicates response;

‑ SABM frame, C/R bit indicates response;

‑ UI frame, C/R bit indicates response;

‑ UA frame, C/R bit indicates command;

‑ DISC frame, C/R bit indicates response;

‑ DM frame, C/R bit indicates command.

Actions:

\- An MDL‑ERROR‑INDICATION primitive with cause \"frame not
implemented\" is sent to the mobile management entity.

G.2.3 EA bit set to \"0\"
-------------------------

Frames with EA bit set to \"0\" are not allowed in the GSM system.

Actions:

\- An MDL‑ERROR‑INDICATION primitive with cause \"frame not
implemented\" is sent to the mobile management entity.

G.3 Parameter errors in the control field
=========================================

G.3.1 Supervisory frames
------------------------

The control field coding:

bit 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1

N(R) P/F 1 1 0 1

is not allowed:

Actions:

\- An MDL‑ERROR‑INDICATION primitive with cause \"frame not
implemented\" is sent to the mobile management entity.

G.3.2 Unnumbered frames
-----------------------

The control field coding.

G.4 Parameter errors in the length indicator field
==================================================

G.4.1 EL bit error
------------------

If the EL bit is set to \"0\", an MDL‑ERROR‑INDICATION primitive with
cause \"frame not implemented\" is sent to the mobile management entity.

G.4.2 Information frames
------------------------

If the length indicator of an I frame is set to a numerical value
L\>N201 or L=0, an MDL‑ERROR‑INDICATION primitive with cause \"I frame
with incorrect length\" is sent to the mobile management entity.

If the numerical value of L is L\<N201 and the M bit is set to \"1\",
then an MDL‑ERROR‑INDICATION primitive with cause \"I frame with
incorrect use of M bit\" is sent to the mobile management entity.

G.4.3 Supervisory frames
------------------------

If a supervisory frame is received with L\>0 or with the M bit set to
\"1\", an MDL‑ERROR‑INDICATION primitive with cause \"S frame with
incorrect parameters\" is sent to the mobile management entity.

G.4.4 DISC and DM frames
------------------------

If a DISC or DM frame is received with L\>0 or with the M bit set to
\"1\", an MDL‑ERROR‑INDICATION primitive with cause \"U frame with
incorrect parameters\" is sent to the mobile management entity.

G.4.5 SABM UA and UI frames
---------------------------

If SABM, UA or UI frames are received with L\>N201 or with the M bit set
to \"1\" an MDL‑ERROR‑INDICATION primitive with cause \"U frame with
incorrect parameters\" is sent to the mobile management entity.
