Foreword
========

This Technical Specification has been produced by the 3^rd^ Generation
Partnership Project (3GPP).

The present document specifies the functions needed for terminal
adaptation within the 3GPP system.

The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work
within the TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the
TSG modify the contents of the present document, it will be re-released
by the TSG with an identifying change of release date and an increase in
version number as follows:

Version x.y.z

where:

x the first digit:

1 presented to TSG for information;

2 presented to TSG for approval;

3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.

y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e.
technical enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.

z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been
incorporated in the document.

1 Scope
=======

The present document is based on the principles of terminal adaptor
functions presented in the ITU-T I-series of Recommendations (I.460 to
I.463).

The PLMN supports a wide range of voice and non-voice services in the
same network. In order to enable non-voice traffic in the PLMN there is
a need to connect various kinds of terminal equipment to the Mobile
Termination (MT). The target of the present document is to outline the
functions needed for the terminal adaptation.

The bearer services are described in 3GPP TS 22.002 and the general
network configuration is described in 3GPP TS 23.002. The PLMN access
reference configuration is defined in 3GPP TS 24.002. The various
connection types used in the A/Gb mode or GERAN Iu mode PLMN are
presented in 3GPP TS 43.010. Terminology used in the present document is
presented in 3GPP TR 21.905 and 3GPP TS 29.990. For support of data
services between a PLMN and other networks see 3GPP TS 29.007.

The present document is valid for a 2^nd^ generation PLMN (A/Gb mode) as
well as for a 3^rd^ generation PLMN (Iu mode). If text applies only for
one of these systems it is explicitly mentioned by using the terms
\"A/Gb mode\" and \"UTRAN Iu mode\". If text applies to both of the
systems, but a distinction between the ISDN/PSTN and the PLMN is
necessary, the term \"PLMN\" is used.

NOTE 1: From R99 onwards the following services are no longer required
by a PLMN:

\- the dual Bearer Services \"alternate speech/data\" and \"speech
followed by data\";

\- the dedicated services for PAD and Packet access;

\- BS 21 \... 26 and BS 31 \... 34.

> From REL-4 onwards the following service is no longer required by a
> PLMN:
>
> \- the synchronous Bearer Service non-transparent (BS 30 NT).
>
> \- non-transparent facsimile (TS 61/62 NT) for the A/Gb mode and GERAN
> Iu mode.

The support of these services is still optional. The specification of
these services is not within the scope of the present document. For
that, the reader is referred to former releases.

NOTE2 : The Gb interface does not play any role in the scope of the
present document although the term \"A/Gb mode\" is used.

5 Functions to support data services
====================================

The main functions of the MT to support data services are:

\- functions to ensure conformity of terminal service requests to
network capability;

\- physical connection of the R reference point;

\- flow control of signalling and mapping of user signalling to/from the
PLMN access signalling;

\- rate adaptation of user data (see 3GPP TS 44.021) and data formatting
for the transmission SAP (3GPP TS 25.322);

\- flow control of non-transparent user data and mapping of flow control
for asynchronous data services;

\- support of data integrity between the MS and the interworking
function in the PLMN;

\- end-to-end synchronization between terminals;

\- filtering of status information;

\- functions to support non-transparent bearer services e.g. termination
of the Radio Link Protocol (RLP) and the Layer 2 Relay function (L2R)
including optional data compression function (where applicable);

\- terminal compatibility checking;

\- optional support of local test loops.

In addition, functions to support autocalling and autoanswering are
optionally specified in accordance with ITU‑T Recommendation V.250
(although the use of other autocalling/auto-answering procedures are not
prohibited provided that mapping in a functionally equivalent way to
3GPP TS 24.008 call control is also provided).

Other functional entities may be envisaged apart from the TAF. One of
the physical interface to all these functions is the DTE/DCE interface
to the MT. Normally, this DTE/DCE interface is associated with the TAF,
if available. Therefore the access to any of these other functional
entities, if implemented, via the DCE/DTE interface, are triggered by
appropriate command sequences which are described in the applicable
specifications (although the use of other procedures is not prohibited
provided that mapping in a functionally equivalent way is also
provided). These command sequences shall be issued by the DTE only when
the MT is in the appropriate command status and there is no data
connection pending. They are interpreted by an MT internal control
function and result in an association of the DTE/DCE interface with the
addressed function, if available.

6 Support of non transparent Bearer Services
============================================

In order to support asynchronous non transparent bearer services a Layer
2 Relay (L2R) function is included in the mobile termination. The
details of the particular L2R function for the different asynchronous
non transparent bearer services are contained in the appropriate 3GPP
27-series Specification. This clause describes the general aspects of
the L2R function.

The Layer 2 Relay (L2R) function provides for the reliable
transportation of known, i.e. asynchronous non transparent, user
protocols across the radio interface of a PLMN. The L2R functions are
located in the Mobile Termination (MT) and the Interworking Function
(IWF) associated with a Mobile Switching Centre (MSC). The L2R uses the
services provided by the Radio Link Protocol (RLP) to transport the
asynchronous non transparent protocol information between the MS and the
IWF.

6.1 Functions of the Layer 2 Relay
----------------------------------

The complete protocol reference models for data and telematic services
are described in 3GPP TS 43.010. The subset of those protocol reference
models relating to the L2R function is reproduced in figure 2A.

NTP Non Transparent Protocol

IFP Interface Protocol

Figure 2A

The Non Transparent Protocol (NTP) is normally a layer 2 protocol for
OSI conformant protocols or an equivalent in the case of non OSI
protocols. The Interface Protocol (IFP) is normally a layer 1 protocol
for OSI conformant systems or equivalent for non OSI systems.

The L2R can be considered to consist of 3 sub-functions, see figure 3.

Figure 3

The 3 sub-functions are:

\- a Non Transparent Protocol Entity;

\- a L2R Protocol Entity;

\- a Relay Entity.

The NTP-entity interfaces the L2R to the IFP-entity and provides an
interface to the particular NTP.

The L2RP-entity interfaces the L2R to the RLP-entity and provides an
interface to the appropriate L2R protocol.

The Relay-entity provides the mapping between the NTP-entity and the
L2R-entity. If applicable, it contains the data compression function.
The negotiable parameters are exchanged with the remote Relay-entity by
means of the RLP XID frame.

It should be noted that the inter-layer interfaces within the MS and the
IWF and within the L2R is not specified by 3GPP, The description given
is for explanatory purposes only and is not intended to indicate a
method of implementation. Therefore, the specification of the L2R is in
terms of the peer-peer protocols. Generally, the non transparent and
interface protocols are specified elsewhere, e.g. ITU-T Recommendations
V.110 or V.120. Thus the main specification for the L2R consists of the
L2R peer‑peer protocols.

### 6.1.1 Layer 2 Relay in Frame Tunneling Mode

L2R is used in FTM to transport asynchronous HDLC (see \[44\]) frames
between the MS and the IWF. In this case there is no NTP entity on the
IWF side. Instead, the L2R entity interfaces a conversion function that
performs a mapping between asynchronous and synchronous HDLC frames,
which are transported on a UDI or RDI bearer with X.31 flag stuffing as
rate adaptation. Consequently there is no error correction or flow
control on the fixed network leg. (The HDLC FCS is used by the higher
layer protocol, and error correction and flow control are performed
end-to-end between the two DTEs.)

6.2 Radio Link Services Used
----------------------------

The L2R function uses services defined in 3GPP TS 24.022.

6.3 Flow Control - General Description
--------------------------------------

A flow control active condition may take place under a number of
circumstances:

\- end-to-end flow control (DTE to DTE matter);

\- backpressure (buffers filling);

\- receive not ready (RLP condition).

It is possible that there may be an interaction between flow control
active and inactive conditions in each circumstance.

### 6.3.1 End to End Flow Control

A DTE may wish to send a flow control active condition to another DTE.

Provisions exist in the L2R entity to transfer a flow control active
condition (sent by its associated DTE) to the other L2R entity as soon
as possible. This mechanism in the L2R entities allows such a flow
control condition to be put ahead of any queuing which exists in the L2R
entities.

Such a mechanism avoids undesirable build up of data buffers.

The L2R entity, receiving a flow control active condition from its
associated DTE, stops sending data to that associated DTE immediately.

### 6.3.2 Back Pressure

The L2R and RLP entities have buffers which may become full to a
predetermined threshold for a number of reasons, e.g. severe radio
fading, failure or slowness of DTE to react to end to end flow control,
certain RNR conditions. When this predetermined threshold is reached, a
flow control active condition is sent to the associated DTE which is
then prevented from sending any data. Subsequently, the flow control
inactive condition is sent to the associated DTE when the L2R or RLP
entities have indicated that there is sufficient free capacity in their
buffers for data flow from the associated DTE to proceed.

The corresponding peer-layer procedure to assess the respective buffer
conditions is a layer management matter and is not dealt with here. It
is also considered an implementation matter to ensure that such
procedure do not result in loss of data or considerable reduction in
throughput.

In FTM, back pressure is not applicable towards the DTE on the fixed
network side, because there is no flow control mechanism on the fixed
network leg. Consequently buffer overflow may occur leading to loss of
data, which is left to the higher layer protocol to handle.

### 6.3.3 Receive not Ready

When the RNR condition arises, an RLP indication is sent to the other
RLP entity which in turn shall send a flow control active condition to
its associated L2R entity. That L2R entity shall then send a flow
control active condition to its associated DTE.

An RNR condition may result in the Execution of \"back pressure\" as
mentioned under subclause 6.3.2.

6.4 User initiated service level up and down grading (applies to A/Gb and GERAN Iu mode only)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When the value of the negotiated UIMI parameter is greater than 0, the
MS may at any time during the call, control, to some extent, the number
of traffic channels to be used. This is done by signalling a higher or
lower value for the Wanted Air Interface User Rate (WAIUR) and maximum
number of traffic channels (mTCH). The network may assign an AIUR
matching the WAIUR using up to mTCH traffic channels, provided that the
resources are available (3GPP TS 22.034, 3GPP TS 23.034 and 3GPP TS
24.008).

If the value of the RLP optional feature \'Up signalling\' is negotiated
to 1, the MS may receive a suggestion from the network to initiate an
upgrading. This occurs when the following condition holds:

The IWF:

1\) is receiving user data from the fixed network side at a higher rate
than the current AIUR; or

2\) in symmetrical calls only, can send user data towards the fixed
network side at a higher rate than the current AIUR.

The MS can detect the condition stated in 1) and 2) above by examining
the value of the UP bit in the received RLP S and I+S frames. When the
condition does not hold, the value of the UP bit is continuously 0. If
the condition does hold, the number of 1s between two consecutive 0s
indicates the number of traffic channels to upgrade by. There is no need
to repeat this indication since the FCS protects it. For instance, if
the UP bit sequence is \...01100\... and the current number of assigned
traffic channels is 2, then an upgrading 4 traffic channels is
suggested.

NOTE: From MSC/IWF\'s perspective a TCH/F28.8 or TCH/F43.2 EDGE
configuration is identical to a multislot 2×TCH/F14.4 or 3×TCH/F14.4
configuration. Therefore, a factor of 1/2 or 1/3 has to be applied to
the suggested increase when the assigned up link channel is TCH/F28.8 or
TCH/F43.2 respectively.

The MS may use the information signalled in the UP bit to find out when
a service level upgrading may increase the data throughput. In order to
initiate a service level upgrading, the value of UIMI shall be greater
than the number of currently assigned channels.

In order to determine when to downgrade, the MS may compare the rate of
received and sent information in the RLP frames to the AIUR. If the rate
of received and sent information is less than the current AIUR the MS
may initiate a downgrading.

User initiated service level up and down grading mechanism may also be
used to modify the asymmetry preference, see subclause 6.5. This is
achieved by sending a new value of the asymmetry preference in the
BC-IE.

6.5 Asymmetry preference indication (applies to A/Gb and GERAN Iu mode only)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The MS\'s classmark may restrict the possible number of channels or
modulation that may be assigned by the network in one of the directions.
This may result in an asymmetric transmission, i.e., different numbers
of channels or modulations are assigned in each direction.

Asymmetric transmission may also result from a preference indication. At
call set up, the MS may send an asymmetry preference indication in the
BC-IE (see 3GPP TS 24.008). There are three options:

1\) no preference;

2\) up link biased asymmetry preferred;

3\) down link biased asymmetry preferred.

If down or up link asymmetry preference is indicated, the network shall
not assign EDGE channels on the unbiased link. If the network assigns
EDGE channels on the biased link, it shall assign TCH/F14.4 on the
unbiased link. The WAIUR shall then apply to the biased link.

7 Structure of the 3GPP TS 27-series of Specifications
======================================================

The structure of the Specifications is as follows:

3GPP TS 27.001 General on Terminal Adaptation Functions for Mobile
Stations.

3GPP TS 27.002 Terminal Adaptation Functions for Services using
Asynchronous Bearer Capabilities.

This document defines the interfaces and terminal adaption functions
integral to a MT which enable the attachment of Asynchronous Terminals
to a MT.

3GPP TS 27.003 Terminal Adaptation Functions for Services using
Synchronous Bearer Capabilities.

This document defines the interfaces and terminal adaptation functions
integral to a MT which enable the attachment of Synchronous Terminals to
a MT.

8 Functions common to all interfaces
====================================

8.1 Synchronization of the Traffic Channel
------------------------------------------

As long as there is no connection between the traffic channel and the
interface to the TE this interface shall be terminated in the
appropriate way.

Prior to exposing the traffic channel of a PLMN connection to
transmission of user data, the controlling entities of the connection
shall assure the availability of the traffic channel(s). This is done by
the so called synchronization process:

\- starting on the indication of \"physical connection established\"
resulting from the PLMN inherent outband signalling procedure. This
indication is given:

\- for MO calls: on reception of the CONNECT message;

\- for MT calls: on reception of the CONNECT ACKNOWLEDGE message;

\- for mobile initiated in-call modification: on reception of the MODIFY
COMPLETE message; and

\- for network initiated in-call modification: on sending the RR/RRC
message confirming the reconfiguration of the traffic channel (in A/Gb
mode: ASSIGNMENT COMPLETE, HANDOVER COMPLETE, or CHANNEL MODE MODIFY
ACKNOWLEDGE; in Iu mode: RADIO BEARER RECONFIGURATION COMPLETE,
TRANSPORT CHANNEL RECONFIGURATION COMPLETE, or PHYSICAL CHANNEL
RECONFIGURATION COMPLETE);

\- ending by indicating the successful execution of this process to the
controlling entity, which then takes care of the further use of the
inband information (data, status).

During the call control phases (set-up and clear), the procedures at the
V.-series DTE interfaces may be mapped completely to the out-of-band
signalling procedure. The state of the S-bits and X-bits during the call
control phases are in this case irrelevant to the DTE interface
procedures. However, the \"ready for data\" condition (i.e. CTs 106 and
109) is derived from the status bits received by the TAF once
synchronization is complete. Since half duplex operation is not
supported by a PLMN, status bit SB is not needed to signal the turn
around of the connection.

### 8.1.1 Transparent services

#### 8.1.1.1 Initial procedure for traffic channel types TCH/F4.8 and TCH/F9.6

With respect to the TAF, for the transparent bearer capability support
the synchronization procedure with the channel codings 2.4 kbit/s, 4.8
kbit/s and 9.6 kbit/s is as follows:

\- sending of synchronization pattern 1/OFF (all data bits \"1\" / all
status bits \"OFF\", all E-bits \"1\") to the IWF. In multislot
transparent operation, the synchronisation pattern sent is 1/OFF with
the exception of the bit positions S1, first X, S3, and S4 which contain
the substream number and multiframe alignment pattern (see 3GPP TS
44.021);

\- searching for detection of the synchronization pattern received from
the IWF, and in multislot operation, also searching for the multiframe
alignment pattern \"0000 1001 0110 0111 1100 0110 1110 101\" (see 3GPP
TS 44.021) in bit position S4 and substream numbers in bit positions S1,
first X, and S3. The value of the bits E4-E7 shall not be checked.

#### 8.1.1.2 Initial procedure for traffic channel types TCH/F14.4 and TCH/F28.8

With respect to the TAF, for the transparent bearer capability support,
the procedure with the TCH/F14.4 or TCH/F28.8 is as follows:

\- sending of synchronization pattern 1/OFF (all data bits \"1\" /
status bits in M2 \"OFF\") to the network in the multiframe structure
with the multiframe alignment pattern \"0000 1001 0110 0111 1100 0110
1110 101\" in the M1 (see 3GPP TS 44.021) and, in a multislot or
TCH/F28.8 case, sending substream numbers in the bit M2;

\- searching for the detection of the multiframe alignment pattern
\"0000 1001 0110 0111 1100 0110 1110 101\" (see 3GPP TS 44.021) in the
bit M1 originating from the network, and, in a multislot or TCH/F28.8
case, searching for substream numbers in the bit M2. (Any 5 bits
sequence in the multiframe alignment pattern is unique, i.e. the
multiframe alignment can take place by the recognition of five
successive S1 bits).

#### 8.1.1.3 Subsequent procedures for traffic channel types TCH/F4.8, TCH/F9.6, TCH/F14.4, and TCH/F28.8

When the synchronisation pattern and, in case of multislot, TCH/F14.4 or
TCH/F28.8 operation the multiframe alignment pattern from the IWF have
been recognized as a steady state (see note) the TAF continues sending
the synchronization patterns to the IWF until a timer T (= 500 ms)
expires.

NOTE: An idle frame sent by the BSS and received by the MS has the same
pattern as the synchronization pattern 1/OFF.

At the moment when the message CONNECT (MO) or CONNACK (MT) is received
at the MS, it is guaranteed that this pattern is received from the
MSC/IWF with the exception of a loss of frame synchronization on the
Abis interface.

The handling of frame stealing in case of 2400 bit/s full rate data
channels is implementation dependent.

##### 8.1.1.3.1 V.-series interface

During the synchronization process described above, i.e. while the
synchronization pattern is being sent by the MT, CT106, 107 and 109
remain in the OFF condition.

After the expiration of the timer T of each allocated traffic channel
for the call, the X and SB bits received from the IWF are mapped on to
CT 106 and CT 109, respectively, at the MT/DTE interface according to
the filtering process described in subclause 8.2. The received SA bit,
if available, is ignored. The condition on CT107 is changed from \"OFF\"
to \"ON\", the data bits received from the IWF are mapped to CT104, and
CT103 is mapped to the data bits sent towards the IWF. The transmitted
SA (if available), SB and X bits shall be set to \"ON\".

##### 8.1.1.3.2 X.-series interface

Void.

##### 8.1.1.3.3 S interface (I.420)

Void.

##### 8.1.1.4 Procedures for RLC

With respect to the TAF for T bearer support, the procedure is as
follows:

\- no access stratum SDUs are transmitted until an access stratum SDU is
received.

##### 8.1.1.4.1 V-series interface

Until the first access stratum SDU is received at the transmission SAP,
CT 106, 107 and 109 remain in the OFF condition. At the reception of the
first SDU, CT 106, CT 107 and CT 109 are changed from OFF to ON at the
DCE/DTE (TE/TAF) interface. The data received in each SDU are mapped to
CT 104 and data on CT 103 are mapped to SDUs sent toward the RNC.

### 8.1.2 Non-transparent services

With respect to the TAF, for non-transparent bearer capability support,
the synchronization procedure in A/Gb and GERAN Iu mode is as follows:

\- firstly, receiving frames on all allocated traffic channels for the
call;

\- secondly, initiating the RLP link establishment by sending a RLP-SABM
across the radio interface.

In UTRAN Iu mode, the TAF shall initiate the RLP after the physical
connection has been established.

#### 8.1.2.1 V.-series interface

During the synchronization process described above, i.e. while the
synchronization pattern is being sent by the MT, CT106, 107 and 109
remain in the OFF condition.

When the RLP link has been established, CT107 shall be changed from
\"OFF\" to \"ON\". From this time the information from/to the RLP,
including status changes, shall be mapped by the L2R entity applicable
to the particular bearer capability (3GPP TS 27.002 \"L2R
functionality\").

#### 8.1.2.2 X.-series interface

Void.

#### 8.1.2.3 S interface (I.420) (does not apply to UTRAN Iu mode)

Void.

### 8.1.3 Action on loss of synchronization

#### 8.1.3.1 Loss at the TAF-radio interface

In A/Gb and GERAN Iu mode, if the TAF detects a loss of synchronisation
on one or more channels, it initiates the re-synchronisation process.
The TAF searches for the data frame structure in those channels in which
the synchronisation has been lost according to the initial procedures
described in subclauses 8.1.1 and 8.1.2. The information received from
the channels shall continue to be processed as if the synchronisation
had not been lost, i.e. corrupted data is forwarded towards RLP entity
or TE during the re-synchronisation process. No action shall be taken on
the frames being transmitted towards the MSC, other than to continue
sending them normally.

In UTRAN Iu mode, no action shall be taken.

#### 8.1.3.2 Loss at the TAF-terminal interface

Void.

8.2 Filtering of Channel Control Information (A/Gb or GERAN Iu mode transparent mode only)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 8.2.1 General

The DTEs used at the MS side of the PLMN conforms to ITU-T\'s DTE/DCE
interface specifications, which assume basically an error-free
environment, i.e.:

\- limited distance, point-to-point local interconnection of the
interface circuits for data and status;

\- steady state signalling.

The envisaged use of these DTEs in the PLMN environment leads to the
exposure of these \"interconnections\" to the PLMN radio channel. To
assure proper operation even under these conditions appropriate measures
have to be taken. In the non transparent case the RLP satisfies the
requirement for both data and status lines.

In the transparent case the:

\- data line aspects have to be dealt with end-to-end by the users;
while

\- status line aspects are of concern to the network, and are dealt with
in the following.

### 8.2.2 Filtering process to be applied

Filtering of channel control information is relevant only at the MS side
and in the transparent mode of operation. By applying filtering measures
the condition of a DTE/DCE control interchange circuit, for which the
DTE constitutes the information sink, is preserved until another
condition is signalled for an \"integration time\" period by the channel
control information (status bits) of the rate adaptation scheme.

The filtering mechanism is understood to reside between the rate
adaptation function (information source) and the DTE (information sink).
It receives the unfiltered condition of the respective control
interchange circuit set according to the actual sequential appearance of
the individual associated status bits and forwards the filtered
condition to the DTE.

The filtering process starts when the traffic channel synchronization
ends with the expiry of timer T.

#### 8.2.2.1 V.-series interface

##### **CT 106** {#ct-106 .H6}

In the transparent mode the remote inband control of this circuit is
needed to support a modem retrain procedure.

OFF-ON transition at the MS authorizes the DTE to send data; if wrongly
set, loss of data may occur.

ON-OFF transition at the MS causes the DTE to cease transmitting data;
set wrongly may impair the performance in connection usage.

##### **CT 109** {#ct-109 .H6}

In the transparent mode the remote inband control of this circuit is
needed to:

\- trigger the interpretation of received data;

\- indicate to the DTE the state of the connection.

OFF-ON transition at the MS authorizes the DTE to rely on the condition
of the received data interchange circuit, set wrongly may cause receipt
of wrong data, while setting late may cause loss of data.

ON-OFF transition at the MS:

\- causes the DTE to cease receiving data;

\- may initiate release of the connection during a data phase by the DTE
giving an ON-OFF transition on circuit 108/2.

Setting this condition wrongly may cause loss of data and potentially
release the connection.

#### 8.2.2.2 X.-series interface

Void.

#### 8.2.2.3 Filtering mechanism

##### 8.2.2.3.1 Traffic channel types TCH/F4.8 and TCH/F9.6

A filtering mechanism shall be provided by an integration process on
those SB and X bits carrying status information in the V.110 frame or in
the multiframe structure. The integration periods applied are:

  -------------- ---------------- ----------------- ------------
  **V-series**   **Transition**   **Integration**   **Status**
                                  **period**        **stream**
                                                    
  CT 106         Off-On           1 s               X
  CT 106         On-Off           1 s               X
  CT 109         Off-On           200 ms            SB
  CT 109         On-Off           5 s               SB
  -------------- ---------------- ----------------- ------------

The integration process shall ensure that the interchange circuits do
not change state in response to spurious transitions of the status bits
during the integration period.

The integration process shall operate reliably with error
characteristics as specified in 3GPP TS 45.005.

##### 8.2.2.3.2 Traffic channel type TCH/F14.4

To change the state of CT 109 or CT 106, it is required that at least
two consecutive SB-bits or X-bits, respectively, carry the same value.

8.3 Terminal Compatibility Decision
-----------------------------------

The establishment of a mobile terminated connection depends on a
positive decision on the terminal compatibility. The Mobile Station (MS)
contributes to this process by performing (depending on the individual
call set-up condition):

\- a compatibility check;

\- the selection of the appropriate terminal function; and

\- the indication of compatibility requirements to the PLMN;

initiated by a call set-up request from the PLMN. The aforementioned
functions shall be carried out as follows.

### 8.3.1 Compatibility Check

Annex B of 3GPP TS 24.008 applies, particularly clause B.3, subclauses
B.3.1 and B.3.2. As regards the therein mentioned user-to-user
compatibility checking the following applies:

When the calling user requests a service with user-to-user compatibility
significance indicated by the presence of HLC and LLC information
element in the call set-up request, the MS shall check that the service
supported by the called user matches concerning the contents of the
HLC/LLC information element. If a mismatch is detected, then the MS
shall reject the offered call using the cause No.88 \"Incompatible
Destination\".

### 8.3.2 Selection of Appropriate Terminal Function

The MS shall select the appropriate terminal functions following a
positive result of the compatibility check and/or forwarding the
indication of compatibility requirements to the PLMN.

### 8.3.3 Indication of Compatibility Requirements to the PLMN

#### 8.3.3.1 Indication in case of Mobile terminating calls

In support of:

\- PSTN originated calls; and

\- ISDN originated calls using 3,1 kHz audio Bearer Capability (BC); as
well as

\- ISDN originated calls using unrestricted digital Bearer Capability
but not specifying all parameters for deducing a Bearer Service.

Mobile specific requirements to be dealt with in the Bearer Capability
information element the call confirmed message has been introduced in
the call control protocol (3GPP TS 24.008). This also allows for
re-negotiation of specific parameters at the beginning of the connection
set-up process. The specific parameters are:

a\) mobile specific requirements:

\- Connection element (transparent/non transparent);

\- Structure (note 1);

\- Synchronous/Asynchronous (note 8);

\- Rate adaptation/other rate adaptation (note 9);

\- User information layer 2 protocol (note 1);

\- Intermediate rate (note 2), (note 3);

\- Modem Type (note 1), (note 3);

\- User Rate (note 3);

\- Compression ,

\- Fixed network user rate, (note 3) (note 4);

\- Other modem type, (note 3) (note 4);

\- User initiated modification indication (note 4).

The following parameters are indicated by the MS to the network, only:

\- Radio Channel Requirement;

\- Acceptable channel codings (note 5);

\- Maximum number of traffic channels, (note 5);

\- Wanted air interface user rate (note 6) (note 7);

\- Asymmetry preference indication (note 7).

NOTE 1: This parameter is correlated with the value of the parameter
connection element.

NOTE 2: For non-transparent services this parameter is correlated with
the value of the parameter negotiation of intermediate rate requested.

NOTE 3: Modification of these parameters may be proposed by the MS. The
Network may accept it or not.

NOTE 4: This parameter shall be included by the MS only if it was
received from the network.

NOTE 5: This parameter shall be included only if the parameter \'fixed
network user rate\' is included.

NOTE 6: This parameter shall be included only for non-transparent
services and if the parameter \'fixed network user rate\' is included.

NOTE 7: This parameter has to be included if EDGE channel coding(s) are
included in Acceptable channel codings. In cases where this parameter
would not otherwise be included, the value is set to \'Air interface
user rate not applicable\' or \'User initiated modification not
requested\' or \"No preference\".

NOTE 8: For FTM and PIAFS, this parameter may be negotiated as in table
B.4e. How the subscription for BS20 is assured, is an operator matter.

NOTE 9: For FTM, PIAFS or Multimedia, this parameter may be negotiated
as in table B.4f.

b\) requirements with effects at the partner terminal:

\- Number of data bits;

\- Number of stop bits;

\- Parity.

The MS indicates the radio channel requirement in the call confirmed
message. If the MS indicates the support of \"dual\" (HR and FR
channels) the final decision, which radio channel is chosen, is done by
the network in an RR message. The radio channel requirement is ignored
in UTRAN Iu mode, see table B.5a in Annex B.

If the network proposes optional support of both transparent and non
transparent connection elements, but does not indicate a user
information layer 2 protocol, the MS shall set the appropriate value, if
choosing non transparent in the call confirmed message and out-band flow
control is not requested, see B.1.1.2.

Additionally the values of the parameters structure, modem type and
intermediate rate have to be set in conformance with the values of the
parameters radio channel requirements, negotiation of intermediate rate
requested and connection element.

Subclause B.1.1.2 and table B.1 in the annex B describe the negotiation
procedure. Annex B table B.4 describes the selection of the modem type
and the dependence on the value of the parameter connection element.
Annex B table B.4 describes the selection of the intermediate rate and
user rate and their dependence upon the value of the NIRR parameter and
the equipment capabilities.

The following MT cases can be deduced from the individual call set-up
request conditions:

a\) If the set-up does not contain a BC information element, the MS in
the call confirmed message shall include any BC information (single or
multiple BC-IE). The MS may use the information provided in the BACKUP
BC information element (see 3GPP TS 29.007 and 3GPP TS 24.008) to deduce
the requested service. Note, that the presence of the BACKUP BC-IE does
not change the condition of \"no BC-IE received\", that means in
particular that the MS shall include any BC-IE (as mentioned before) and
shall not negotiate parameter values where the MSC has to offer a value
in the BC-IE first, as e.g., for the parameter \"compression\". If
multiple BC-IEs are present, one BC-IE shall indicate the information
transfer capability \"speech\". A 3,1 kHz multimedia BC-IE together with
a speech BC-IE indicates the support of a fallback to speech. A UDI/RDI
multimedia BC-IE together with a speech BC-IE indicates the support of
service change and fallback (see 3GPP TS 29.007 and 3GPP TS 24.008).

b\) If the set-up message contains a single BC-IE, the MS in the call
confirmed message shall use either a single BC‑IE, if it wants to
negotiate mobile specific parameter values or, unless otherwise
specified, no BC-IE, if it agrees with the requested ones.

c\) If the set-up contains a multiple BC-IE, the MS in the call
confirmed message shall use either a multiple BC-IE, if it wants to
negotiate mobile specific parameter values or, unless otherwise
specified, no BC-IE, if it agrees with the requested ones.

\- For a 3,1kHz multimedia setup the MS may either accept the
possibility of a fallback to speech by responding with two BC-IEs, or
turn the call to a speech call by sending only a speech BC-IE in the
call confirmed message or turn the call to a multimedia only call (i.e.
no fallback to speech allowed) by sending only a multimedia BC-IE, in
the call confirmed message.

\- For a UDI/RDI multimedia setup, the MS may either accept the
possibility of service change by responding with two BC-IEs , or turn
the call to a speech call by sending only a speech BC-IE in the call
confirmed message, or turn the call to a multimedia call by sending only
a multimedia BC-IE in the call confirmed message.

\- For facsimile, a single BC-IE, containing fax group 3 only, shall be
used if a multiple BC-IE requesting speech alternate fax group 3 is
received and the MS is not able to support the speech capability. Annex
B, table B.7, describes the negotiation rules.

If the BC-IE contains 3,1 kHz ex PLMN, the MS is allowed to negotiate
all mobile specific parameter values listed above. If the BC-IE contains
facsimile group 3, the MS is not allowed to negotiate any mobile
specific parameter value. In any case, if the set-up message requests a
\"single service\", the MS shall not answer in the call confirmed
message requesting a \"dual service\".

However, for dual services with repeat indicator set to \"circular
(alternate)\" or to \"service change and fallback\" the MS may change
the sequence of dual BC‑IEs within the call confirmed message (preceded
by the same value of the repeat indicator), if it wants to start with a
different Bearer Capability than proposed by the network as the initial
one.

In addition, the MS may propose to the network to modify User Rate,
Modem Type and Intermediate Rate in the CALL CONFIRMED message. The
network may accept or release the call.

If the BC-IE received from the network contains the parameters \'fixed
network user rate\', \'other modem type\' and possibly the \'user
initiated modification\', the MS shall either:

a\) include no BC-IE or a BC-IE without these parameters in the call
confirmed message, i.e. the MS discards these parameters (only allowed
in A/Gb mode); or

b\) include the possibly modified values for the \'fixed network user
rate\' and \'other modem type\' in the BC-IE of the call confirmed
message. The network might accept or reject the modified values. In this
case the MS shall also include the parameters \'maximum number of
traffic channels\' and \'acceptable channel codings\'. Additionally for
non-transparent services, the MS shall also include the parameters
\'wanted air interface user rate\' and the \'user initiated modification
indication\'. The parameters \'acceptable channel codings extended\' and
\'asymmetry indication\' may also be included.

In case a), the MS shall use the fall-back bearer service indicated by
the remaining parameters of the BC-IE on a single slot configuration
(reference 3GPP TS 44.021).

In case b), the MS shall use in A/Gb or GERAN Iu mode a singleslot or
multislot configuration according to the rules defined in 3GPP TS
44.021, 3GPP TS 48.020 and 3GPP TS 24.022.

If the \'acceptable channel codings\' is indicated by the MS, the
decision which channel coding is used is done by the network and
indicated to the mobile station with a RR message. This RR message may
also assign an asymmetric channel coding. The \'acceptable channel
codings\' parameter takes precedence over the \'negotiation of
intermediate rate requested\' parameter for non-transparent services.
Also the intermediate rate and user rate per traffic channel in a
multislot configuration are not indicated by the \'intermediate rate\'
and \'user rate\' parameters of the BC-IE, but depend on the chosen
channel coding only.

If no BC-IE is received in the SETUP message, the MS may include the
parameters \'fixed network user rate\', \'other modem type\' etc. (i.e.
octets 6d, 6e, 6f, and 6g, see 3GPP TS 24.008) in the BC-IE of the CALL
CONFIRMED message. However, in this case, the network may release the
call if it does not support these parameters.

If FNUR = 33.6 kbit/s is agreed on in the setup of a 3.1 kHz multimedia
call, the modems may handshake to 31.2 kbit/s or 28.8 kbit/s. In this
case the MS receives a MODIFY message from the MSC to indicate the new
data rate, and shall respond with a MODIFY COMPLETE message (see 3GPP TS
24.008), if it supports the requested modification. If the MS does not
support the requested modification, it shall respond with a MODIFY
REJECT message. The MT shall indicate the new data rate to the TE (e.g.
using the ITU-T Recommendation V.80 inband signalling) in order to cause
the TE to use stuffing to adapt the 31.2 or 28.8 kbit/s data rate to the
33.6 kbit/s traffic channel between the TE and IWF.

#### 8.3.3.2 Indication in case of Mobile originating calls

In support of mobile originating calls the values of BC-IE parameters
are requested in the set-up message from the MS. If the MS indicates the
support of both transparent and non transparent connection elements the
network shall return its choice in the call proceeding message. The MS
is not allowed to indicate support of both transparent and non
transparent, if the MS also requests out-band flow control, i.e. it does
not indicate a layer 2 protocol.

Additionally the value of the parameter modem type has to be set
depending on the value of the parameter connection element as described
in annex B, table B.4a.

The set-up message contains a single or multiple BC-IE. If multiple
BC-IEs are present, one BC-IE shall indicate the information transfer
capability \"speech\".

For a 3,1 kHz multimedia call, the setup message contains either a
multimedia BC-IE indicating a multimedia only call request (i.e. no
fallback to speech allowed) or both a 3,1 kHz multimedia BC-IE and a
speech BC-IE to indicate the support of a fallback to speech (see 3GPP
TS 29.007 and 3GPP TS 24.008).

For a UDI/RDI multimedia call, the setup message contains either a
multimedia BC-IE indicating a multimedia only call request, or both a
multimedia BC-IE and a speech BC-IE (in any order) to indicate the
support of service change and fallback (see 3GPP TS 29.007 and 3GPP TS
24.008). The latter is not applicable to multimedia calls with FNUR=32.0
kbit/s.

If the set-up message requests a \"single service\", the network shall
not answer in the call proceeding message requesting a \"dual service\".
Alternatively the network shall answer with a single BC-IE containing
fax group 3 if a multiple BC-IE requesting speech alternate fax group 3
is received but the network does not allow the use of this alternate
service. Annex B, table B.7, describes the negotiation rules.

If the MS requests a \"dual service\" the network is not allowed to
change the sequence of the service, a change may however occur due to
the called user and this may then be relayed back to the originating MS
by the network.

If the setup message requests a 3.1 kHz multimedia service with
fallback, the network may return both BC-IEs in the same order to accept
the request, or a single BC-IE if fallback or one of the requested
services are not allowed.

If the setup message requests a UDI/RDI multimedia service with
fallback, the network may return both BC-IEs in the same order to accept
the request, both BC-IEs in the reverse order (relayed from terminating
User), or a single BC-IE if fallback, service change or one of the
requested services are not allowed.

If the set-up message indicates that negotiation of intermediate rate is
requested then the network shall behave as described in annex B, table
B.4b.

Unless otherwise specified, if no BC-IE parameter needs negotiation it
is up to the network if it sends a CALL PROCEEDING message (with or
without a BC-IE) towards the MS or not.

For MS to network direction, octet 6e shall be included whenever octet
6d is included (see 3GPP TS 24.008).

For multislot, TCH/F14.4, and EDGE operations and in Iu mode the MS
shall include an appropriate set of the parameters \'fixed network user
rate\', \'other modem type\', \'maximum number of TCH\' and \'acceptable
channel codings\' in the BC-IE of the SETUP message. If EDGE channel
coding(s) are included in ACC for transparent calls, the \'Wanted air
interface user rate\'-parameter shall be set to \'Air interface user
rate not applicable\' and the \'User initiated modification
indication\'-parameter to \'User initiated modification not requested\'.
In a non-transparent multislot operation, the MS shall also include the
parameters \'wanted air interface user rate\' and \'user initiated
modification indication\' in the BC-IE of the SETUP message. In a
non-transparent TCH/F14.4 or EDGE operation or in Iu mode the MS shall
also include the parameter \'wanted air interface user rate\'. In
non-transparent EDGE operation the MS shall also include the parameter
\'asymmetry preference indication\'. It shall also set the other
parameters of the BC-IE (i.e. \'user rate\') to values identifying
fall-back values. Depending on the network two situations can be
distinguished:

a\) The network supports the requested operation:

\- in this case the network shall include the parameter \'fixed network
user rate\', \'other modem type\' and possibly \'user initiated
modification\' in the BC-IE(s) of the CALL PROCEEDING message,
irrespective whether or not they contain modified values or just a copy
of the received ones;

\- the \'acceptable channel codings\' indicated by the MS in the SETUP
message takes precedence over the \'negotiation of intermediate rate
requested\' parameter for non-transparent services. The intermediate
rate per traffic channel and the user rate per traffic channel is
dependent on the chosen channel coding only. The chosen channel coding
is indicated to the mobile station by the network with an RR message.

b\) The network does not support the requested operation:

\- in this case, in A/Gb mode, the BC-IE of the CALL PROCEEDING message
does not contain the parameters fixed network user rate\' and \'other
modem type\' or no BC-IE is included in the CALL PROCEEDING message at
all. The mobile station shall then discard the parameters \'fixed
network user rate\', \'other modem type\', \'maximum number of TCH\',
\'acceptable channel codings\' \'wanted air interface user rate\' and
\'user initiated modification indication\' sent with the SETUP message
and apply the fall-back bearer service;

\- in Iu mode the network shall release the call.

In case a), the MS shall use in A/Gb and GERAN Iu mode a singleslot or
multislot configuration according to the rules defined in 3GPP TS
44.021, 3GPP TS 48.020 and 3GPP TS 24.022.

In case b), the MS shall use in A/Gb mode the fall-back bearer service
indicated by the remaining parameters of the BC-IE on a single slot
configuration (reference 3GPP TS 44.021).

If FNUR = 33.6 kbit/s is agreed on in the setup of a 3.1 kHz multimedia
call, the modems may handshake to 31.2 kbit/s or 28.8 kbit/s. In this
case the MS receives a MODIFY message from the MSC to indicate the new
data rate, and shall respond with a MODIFY COMPLETE message (see 3GPP TS
24.008), if it supports the requested modification. If the MS does not
support the requested modification, it shall respond with a MODIFY
REJECT message. The MT shall indicate the new data rate to the TE (e.g.
using the ITU-T Recommendation V.80 inband signalling) in order to cause
the TE to use stuffing to adapt the 31.2 kbit/s or 28.8 kbit/s data rate
to the 33.6 kbit/s traffic channel between the TE and IWF.

#### 8.3.3.3 Differences in validity of BC parameter values in A/Gb mode, GERAN Iu mode and UTRAN Iu mode

The validity of a BC parameter value, either in the SETUP or CALL
CONFIRMED message, may differ from A/Gb mode to GERAN Iu mode and to
UTRAN Iu mode. Certain parameters are irrelevant in UTRAN or GERAN Iu
mode and any value given is valid and ignored. These parameters may be
available in the BC IE. For those parameters that are relevant in UTRAN
Iu mode, GERAN Iu mode and A/Gb mode, certain values may be invalid in
one of the systems. Invalid parameter values may cause rejection of the
BC and subsequent release of the call.

Parameters that are ignored in UTRAN or GERAN Iu mode may be set to
default values, or to specific values in view of an eventual handover to
A/Gb mode. They may also be set to values that make call setup in
current system impossible. This indicates the need for a handover to
another radio access technology. Parameter values that are invalid in
one system may also result in unsuccessful handover from the other
system.

Table B.5a in annex B lists parameters that are ignored in UTRAN or
GERAN Iu mode and parameter values which validity is different in A/Gb
mode, GERAN Iu mode and UTRAN Iu mode.

8.4 Test Loops
--------------

In principle, both V -series and X -series interfaces allow for an
activation of local or remote test loops by the terminal (see ITU-T
Recommendations V.54/X.150). A comprehensive solution of such test loops
in a PLMN system has to consider the special conditions of the interface
between the terminal (part of the MS) and the transmission equipment
(part of the modem pool of a particular IWF within the MSC). In
addition, the impact of the radiolink is to be taken into account with
respect to the test objectives. Due to those special conditions a PLMN
system is not capable to support remote test loops. It is an
implementation choice to what extent the activation of local test loops
by the terminal is supported in the MT.

8.5 Alternate speech/facsimile group 3
--------------------------------------

### 8.5.1 In case of A/Gb mode

This alternate service may be initiated by a manual procedure where
CT106, CT107, CT108.2 and CT109 are set in the OFF condition.

Selection of the data phase (from the speech phase) may be by manual
intervention via the MS causing ICM by means of CT108.2 going to ON
condition, refer to 3GPP TS 03.45. The ensuing data phase shall follow
all the operational procedures as described in 3GPP 27-series.

Selection of the speech phase (from the data phase) may be by manual
intervention via the MS causing ICM (phone off-hook condition at the MT
and data call end condition at the TE).

During the ensuing speech phases, CT107, CT106 and CT109 shall be
maintained in the OFF condition.

Subsequent re-selection of the data phase may be by manual intervention
via the MS causing CT108.2 going to ON condition initiating ICM. At this
point, re-synchronization shall take place as described in subclause
8.1.

### 8.5.2 In case of UTRAN Iu mode

Refer to subclauses 9.2.1.1 and 9.2.2.1 in 3GPP TS 23.146.

8.6 Multislot configuration split/combine function
--------------------------------------------------

In multislot configurations using multiple parallel channels the data
flow is split into substreams between the Spit/Combine-function in the
TAF and the network.

### 8.6.1 Non-transparent data

In non-transparent data operations the N(S)-numbering in the RLP-header
is used for controlling the order of the data in the substreams
(reference 3GPP TS 24.022).

### 8.6.2 Transparent data

In transparent multislot configurations (TCH/F9.6 or TCH/F4.8) status
bits S1, S3 and the X-bit between the D12 and D13 are used for
transferring substream numbering information. This S4-bit is used for
frame synchronization between the parallel substreams (reference 3GPP TS
44.021).

In case of a transparent multislot configuration using TCH/F14.4 channel
coding, bit M1 in the 290-bit radio interface block is used for frame
synchronization between the parallel substreams, whereas bit M2 carries
status information, NIC codes and substream numbering as described in
3GPP TS 44.021.

In transparent TCH/F28.8 channels, bits M1 and M2 are used as described
above for transparent TCH/F14.4 channels.

8.7 EDGE multiplexing function 
------------------------------

In EDGE configurations the number of channels across the air interface
and that of substreams between BTS and MSC do not necessarily match. In
such cases a multiplexing function is included at MS and BTS (3GPP TS
44.021 and 3GPP TS 48.020). These functions distribute data between the
substreams and radio channels.

8.8 Seamless data rate change
-----------------------------

If the modems change the data rate during an ongoing multimedia call
(using the ITU-T Recommendation V.34 seamless data rate change
mechanism), the MSC initiates a MODIFY message (see 3GPP TS 24.008) to
indicate the new data rate to the MS. The MT shall indicate the new data
rate to the TE (e.g. using the ITU-T Recommendation V.80 inband
signaling) in order to cause the TE to use stuffing to adapt the 31.2
kbit/s or 28.8 kbit/s data rate to the 33.6 kbit/s traffic channel
between the TE and IWF.

provided to support Terminal adaptation function to Interworking control
procedures. Some parameters are ignored in GERAN or UTRAN Iu mode

For a configuration with data rates 9.6kbit/s or higher, the following
applies to the parameters contained in the BC-IE:

\- Half rate channels are not supported. The MS shall code the radio
channel requirement as \"Full rate support only MS\" or \"Dual rate
support MS, full rate preferred\'. In the second case, the network shall
assign full rate channel(s) only.

\- The \'fixed network user rate\' and \'other modem type\' takes
precedence over the \'user rate\' and \'modem type\', unless the \'modem
type\' indicates \"autobauding\".

\- The ACC indicates which channel coding is acceptable and supported by
the MS. In case of CE:NT the TCH/F4.8 and TCH/F9.6 acceptable is
equivalent to the support of NIRR. If TCH/F4.8 acceptable only or
TCH/F9.6 acceptable only or TCH/F14.4 acceptable only is indicated, the
assigned channel type which can be chosen by the network is TCH/F4.8 or
TCH/F9.6 or TCH/F14.4, respectively.

\- The \'intermediate rate\' parameter is overridden. The intermediate
rate used per each TCH/F is derived from the chosen channel type:

  ------------------ ------------------------------------
  **channel type**   **IR per TCH/F**
  TCH/F4.8           8 kbit/s
  TCH/F9.6           16 kbit/s
  TCH/F14.4          intermediate rate is to be defined
  ------------------ ------------------------------------

\- The user rate per TCH is derived from the chosen channel type:

  ------------------ -----------------------
  **channel type**   **user rate per TCH**
  TCH/F4.8           4.8 kbit/s
  TCH/F9.6           9.6 kbit/s
  ------------------ -----------------------

For CE:T, the padding procedure described in 3GPP TS 44.021 can be
applied.

######## Annex B (normative): Setting of Bearer Capability, Low Layer Compatibility and High Layer Compatibility Information Element for PLMN Bearer Services and PLMN TeleServices

B.0 Scope
=========

This annex describes the relationship between the various parameters of
the PLMN Bearer Capability Information Element (BC-IE), their validity
and the possible settings with reference to each PLMN Bearer
service/Teleservice defined in 3GPP TS 22.002 and 3GPP TS 22.003 and
various occurrences during the connection control (clause B.1).
Furthermore, the contents of the Low Layer (LLC) and the High Layer
(HLC) Compatibility Information Elements are described (clause B.2).

B.1 Bearer Capability Information Element
=========================================

B.1.1 Introduction
------------------

### B.1.1.1 General Consideration

In general, the purpose of the Bearer Capability Information Element
(BC-IE) is to request a particular bearer service to be provided by the
network. This indication is carried by certain connection control
messages which for the subject matter of the present document may be
categorized into those messages:

\- related to the call set-up phase; and

\- those used during the established connection.

During the call set-up phase the PLMN BC-IE (single or multiple) is
included in:

\- the SETUP message generated by the requesting entity (either MS or
MSC) to establish a mobile‑originated or mobile-terminated call,
respectively, and in

> \- the CALL CONFIRMED or CALL PROCEEDING messages, respectively,
> generated by the responding entity (either MS or MSC) in order to
> negotiate certain parameter values. If no BC-IE is contained in the
> SETUP message (a mobile terminated call with the single-numbering
> scheme) the CALL CONFIRMED message indicates the complete applicable
> BC-IE. The network may release the call if it does not support the
> service indicated by the BC-IE. Also, if the service does not match
> with the service requested from the fixed network terminal the MSC/IWF
> may release the call.

NOTE: In the latter case also the fixed network terminal may release the
call.

During the established connection the PLMN BC-IE is included in the
MODIFY, MODIFY COMPLETE, and MODIFY REJECT messages in order to change
the service (bearer capability) or to change the maximum number of
traffic channels and/or wanted air interface user rate when a
non-transparent multislot data service is in use.

If the maximum number of traffic channels and/or wanted air interface
user rate is to be changed, the BC-IE included in the MODIFY message
shall not indicate a different bearer service than the one used at this
stage of the connection - the values of the parameters \'maximum number
of traffic channels\' and/or \'wanted air interface user rate\' may be
changed, only.

The subsequent tables and subclauses of clause B.1 deal with the
representation of the individual contents of the PLMN BC-IE during the
call set-up phase. For the use during the established connection refer
to 3GPP TS 24.008.

With respect to the individual parameter settings at the MS the
following cases may be distinguished (see 3GPP TS 27.002 and 3GPP TS
27.003):

\- Mobile-originated call set up by a MS:

\- The setting results from respective MMI actions and/or MT internal
settings.

\- Mobile-terminated call set up to a MS:

\- The BC related part of the compatibility check is carried out
according to the knowledge of the MT concerning its implemented
functions (i.e. answering the call). The requested field values of the
non‑negotiable parameters and the selected field values of the
negotiable parameters determine the selection of the terminal function
to be used for the intended connection.

### B.1.1.2 Interpretation of the Diagrams

The purpose of the subsequent diagrams is to achieve unambiguous
representation of the individual contents of the PLMN BC-IE for the
various occurrences during the call set-up phase, covering all bearer
services and teleservices according to 3GPP TS 22.002 and 3GPP TS
22.003.

The basic principle adopted is a graphic scheme, or mask, wherein the
ordinate designates the individual parameters of the PLMN BC-IE and the
abscissa gives the possible field values of these parameters. The
abbreviations used in these sections are defined in table B.5. The
allowed content of any PLMN BC-IE is represented by a number of graphs
connecting parameter values (abscissa points) of all parameters
(ordinate points). Each graphic scheme is subdivided into two
independent parts:

\- \"Layer/Protocol related\" part; and

\- \"Radio Channel related\" part.

The generation of all PLMN BC-IEs in all call set-up messages shall be
in accordance with these graphs. Subclauses B.1.2 through B.1.11 show
individual sets of graphs for each service group (BS/TS) and for each
type of applicable Information Transfer Capability.

In addition, the following rules apply:

\- Those parameters which have only one possible field value for all
recognized services are shown in table B.5, where they are marked
accordingly in the column \"common setting of field values\". They are
not represented in the graphic scheme.

\- Not all parameters of the PLMN BC-IE are relevant for each service
(BS/TS). This is represented by specific abscissa points with a value of
\"NA\" (Not Applicable) allocated to these parameters. The graphs pass
through these points for each such parameter. The actual field value to
be used in the PLMN BC-IE is marked in the column \"default setting of
field values (NA)\" of table B.5. An abscissa point with a value of
\"NAV\" (Not AVailable) indicates that the entire octet carrying this
parameter (see table B.2 \"General Structure of the PLMN BC-Information
Element\") shall be omitted.

\- Unless FTM is applied, there is a particular dependency of the
parameters \"User Information Layer 2 Protocol (UIL2P)\" and
\"Connection Element (CE)\":

\- If the MS sends a PLMN BC-IE with a CE value other than \"Transparent
(T)\", the parameter UIL2P is essential. Its field value must be set as
indicated in the applicable graph.

\- If the MSC sends a PLMN BC-IE in the SETUP message, the parameter
UIL2P may also be absent in the case of the CE parameter value being
other than \"Transparent (T)\".

\- In case FTM is applied, the PLMN BC-IE shows a CE value
\"non-transparent\", SA value \"asynchronous\", and RA value X.31 flag
stuffing. The UIL2P is not available.

\- Certain parameters of the PLMN BC-IE may be negotiated during the
connection establishment phase. Table B.1 shows these parameters and the
relations of their values in the SETUP message and in the CALL
CONFIRMED/CALL PROCEEDING message, respectively, both for the
mobile-originated and mobile-terminated case. A parameter may indicate a
field value of one of the following types:

\- \"requested value\" indicating a request which cannot be changed by
the responding entity;

\- \"offered value\" indicating a proposal which may be changed by the
responding entity;

\- a particular choice value leaving it up to the responding entity
which value ultimately applies;

\- \"as requested\" indicating that the requested value applies and is
confirmed (by returning it);

\- \"selected value\" indicating that a particular value applies either
out of the offered set or as a free choice out of the defined set of
values;

\- \"supported value\" indicating a value supported by the responding
entity.

1\) No autobauding capability in the IWF:MSC.

2\) CE:T selected by IWF/MSC.

3\) Free choice if the SETUP contains no BC-IE (single numbering
scheme).

If the IWF/MSC has no autobauding capability, a V-series modem type is
used.

4\) When the MS does not allow the use of autobauding capability.

5\) CE:T selected by the MS.

6\) When the MT indicates \"autobauding\" , \"modem for undefined
interface\" or \"none\", the OMT shall be set to \"no other modem
type\". Any other values of the MT is overridden by the OMT value.

Table B.4b: Intermediate Rate negotiation procedure

If the user rate is 9.6 kbit/s the intermediate rate negotiation
procedure is not applicable and NIRR shall be set to \"No meaning\".

Recipient of SETUP supports full rate, non transparent, 6 kbit/s radio
interface rate and the user rate is up to/equal 4,8 kbit/s:

  -------------- ------------------------ --------------------------------
  BC-parameter   Message SETUP            Message CALL CONF or CALL PROC
  NIRR           6 kbit/s                 6 kbit/s
  IR             16 kbit/s                8 kbit/s
  User Rate      up to/equal 4,8 kbit/s   as requested
  -------------- ------------------------ --------------------------------

NOTE 1: In case of a Mobile Terminated Call, if the SETUP message does
not contain a BC‑IE, the MS shall behave as if NIRR set to \"No
meaning\".

In case of a MO CALL or a MT CALL where no BC-IE is included in the CALL
PROCEEDING or CALL CONFIRMED message, respectively, the MS or the
network shall behave as if the NIRR was set to \"No meaning\".

Recipient of SETUP does support full rate, non transparent, but not in
connection with 6 kbit/s radio interface rate:

  -------------- ------------------------ --------------------------------
  BC-parameter   Message SETUP            Message CALL CONF or CALL PROC
  NIRR           6 kbit/s                 No meaning
  IR             16 kbit/s                16 kbit/s
  User Rate      up to/equal 4,8 kbit/s   as requested
  -------------- ------------------------ --------------------------------

NOTE 2: If no other parameter needs negotiation, the CALL CONF/PROC
message need not contain any BC-IE.

In case of a MO CALL or a MT CALL where no BC-IE is included in the CALL
PROCEEDING or CALL CONFIRMED message, respectively, the MS or the
network shall behave as if the NIRR was set to \"No meaning\".

NOTE 3: In case a GBS-operation is requested and acknowledged, the MS
indicates the acceptable channel codings. The indicated acceptance of
TCH/F4.8 is equivalent to the support of 6 kbit/s radio interface rate
per TCH/F and therefore overrides the NIRR parameter.

NOTE: Although a parameter value is marked as \"valid\", the validity
may be restricted by rules given elsewhere in the present document.

NOTE 1: This parameter is relevant in UTRAN Iu mode for NT calls, in
conjunction with WAIUR, for deciding which RLP version to negotiate in
order to avoid renegotiation of RLP version in case of handover, see
3GPP TS 24.022 \[9\]. It is otherwise irrelevant for specifying the
UTRAN Iu mode radio access bearer.

NOTE 2: The MS can indicate that the requested service is not supported
in A/Gb or GERAN Iu mode by setting all Acceptable Channel Codings to
"none" (all zeros) and the Maximum Number of Traffic Channels parameter
to the value "one TCH" (zero). The network will interpret these values
as an indication that a handover to another mode (e.g. UTRAN Iu mode) is
needed before the call setup can proceed. Similarly, while in another
mode, the MS can inform the network that the MS does not support the
requested service in A/Gb or GERAN Iu mode.

the BSS during the Assignment procedure subject to the restrictions that
the number of assigned TCH/F may not exceed the mTCH, that the channel
coding is among the ACC and that the AIUR equals the FNUR.

The radio interface configuration may be changed by the BSS during the
call as long as the channel coding used is among the ACC, the mTCH is
not exceeded and the AIUR is kept constant (ref. 3GPP TS 22.034).

### B.1.12.2 Non-transparent services

The MS is allowed to signal any combination of WAIUR, ACC and mTCH
compliant to the following table. A combination is compliant to the
table, if there exists at least one row that it is compliant to. A
combination is compliant to a row if each parameter value meets the
conditions given in that row. When a WAIUR, ACC, mTCH combination is
compliant to a row, the network is allowed to assign any Channel Mode
compliant to that row. The notes of the table provide further details on
the compliance conditions.

The final decision about the radio interface configuration is taken by
the BSS during the Assignment procedure. The BSS may assign any number
of TCH/F ranging from 1 to mTCH and use any of the channel codings among
the ACC. The BSS shall try to reach the WAIUR if the resource situation
allows it. The maximum possible AIUR shall not exceed the WAIUR unless
the higher AIUR can be reached with a smaller number of TCH/F (ref. 3GPP
TS 22.034).

The radio interface configuration may be changed by the BSS during the
call as long as the channel coding used is among the ACC and the mTCH is
not exceeded.

B.2 Low Layer/High Layer Compatibility Information Element
==========================================================

B.2.1 Introduction
------------------

### B.2.1.1 General Consideration

The purpose of the Low Layer/High Layer Compatibility Information
Element (LLC/HLC-IE) is to provide a means for additional end-to-end
compatibility checking by an addressed entity (e.g. a remote user, an
interworking unit or a high layer function network node). The LLC/HLC-IE
may be manipulated by the PLMN to maintain consistency with the setup
parameter negotiation between the mobile station and the network (ref.
to 3GPP TS 29.007). The LLC/HLC-IE is transferred transparently by the
ISDN between the call originating PLMN and the addressed entity.

With respect to the individual parameter settings at the MS the
following cases may be distinguished (see 3GPP TS 27.002 and 3GPP TS
27.003):

\- Mobile-originated call set up by a MS consisting of a MT with R
interface:

\- The setting results from respective MMI actions and/or MT internal
settings.

\- Mobile-terminated call set up to a MS consisting of a MT with R
interface:

\- The LLC/HLC related part of the compatibility check is carried out
according to the knowledge of the MT concerning its implemented
functions (i.e. answering the call). The offered field values determine
the selection of the terminal function for the intended connection.

Where applicable, the same settings and rules concerning LLC and/or HLC
apply as for ISDN use (ref. ITU-T Recommendation Q.931 and ETR 018).
However, considering that PLMN data transmission is based on ITU-T V.110
rate adaptation, the MS shall provide the LLC-IE for mobile-originated
calls when using unrestricted or restricted digital information transfer
capability. This is to assure the conveyance of the e.g. \"ITU-T V.110\"
indication towards the called entity, as the comparable indication in
the ISDN BC-IE may be lost. It shall also be possible to choose whether
or not the LLC-IE is provided for the case of an information transfer
capability \"3,1 kHz audio ex PLMN\".

There shall be no contradiction of the information between the BC-IE and
LLC-IE at the originating side. However, as some parts of the bearer
capability may be modified during the transport of the call, there
should be minimum duplication of this information between the BC-IE and
the LLC-IE.

If as a result of duplication, a contradiction occurs between the BC-IE
and the LLC-IE at the terminating side, the receiving entity shall
ignore the conflicting information in the LLC-IE.

### B.2.1.2 Interpretation of the Tables

The individual contents of the LLC/HLC-IE are represented in the
following tables. The indication of the applicable service group defines
the link between the PLMN BC-IE and its associated LLC/HLC-IEs.

If the appropriate message includes multiple BC-IEs and if LLC and/or
HLC information is available, multiple LLCs and HLCs shall be included
in the message. The LLC/HLC associated with the BC-IE indicating speech
shall be marked as \"not applicable\" (3GPP TS 24.008).
