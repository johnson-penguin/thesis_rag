Foreword
========

This Technical Specification has been produced by the 3rd Generation
Partnership Project (3GPP).

The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work
within the TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the
TSG modify the contents of the present document, it will be re-released
by the TSG with an identifying change of release date and an increase in
version number as follows:

Version x.y.z

where:

x the first digit:

1 presented to TSG for information;

2 presented to TSG for approval;

3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.

y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e.
technical enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.

z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been
incorporated in the document.

In the present document, modal verbs have the following meanings:

**shall** indicates a mandatory requirement to do something

**shall not** indicates an interdiction (prohibition) to do something

The constructions \"shall\" and \"shall not\" are confined to the
context of normative provisions, and do not appear in Technical Reports.

The constructions \"must\" and \"must not\" are not used as substitutes
for \"shall\" and \"shall not\". Their use is avoided insofar as
possible, and they are not used in a normative context except in a
direct citation from an external, referenced, non-3GPP document, or so
as to maintain continuity of style when extending or modifying the
provisions of such a referenced document.

**should** indicates a recommendation to do something

**should not** indicates a recommendation not to do something

**may** indicates permission to do something

**need not** indicates permission not to do something

The construction \"may not\" is ambiguous and is not used in normative
elements. The unambiguous constructions \"might not\" or \"shall not\"
are used instead, depending upon the meaning intended.

**can** indicates that something is possible

**cannot** indicates that something is impossible

The constructions \"can\" and \"cannot\" are not substitutes for \"may\"
and \"need not\".

**will** indicates that something is certain or expected to happen as a
result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside
the scope of the present document

**will not** indicates that something is certain or expected not to
happen as a result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which
is outside the scope of the present document

**might** indicates a likelihood that something will happen as a result
of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document

**might not** indicates a likelihood that something will not happen as a
result of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside
the scope of the present document

In addition:

**is** (or any other verb in the indicative mood) indicates a statement
of fact

**is not** (or any other negative verb in the indicative mood) indicates
a statement of fact

The constructions \"is\" and \"is not\" do not indicate requirements.

1 Scope
=======

The present document specifies the set of protocols and APIs for 5G
Media Streaming (5GMS) services based on the 5G Media Streaming
Architecture (5GMSA). 5GMS supports services including MNO and
third-party Downlink Media Streaming Services, and MNO and third-party
Uplink Media Streaming Services.

2 References
============

The following documents contain provisions which, through reference in
this text, constitute provisions of the present document.

\- References are either specific (identified by date of publication,
edition number, version number, etc.) or non‑specific.

\- For a specific reference, subsequent revisions do not apply.

\- For a non-specific reference, the latest version applies. In the case
of a reference to a 3GPP document (including a GSM document), a
non-specific reference implicitly refers to the latest version of that
document *in the same Release as the present document*.

4.3 Procedures of the M1 (5GMS Provisioning) interface
------------------------------------------------------

### 4.3.1 General

A 5GMS Application Provider may use the procedures in this clause to
provision the network for media streaming sessions that are operated by
that 5GMS Application Provider. For downlink media streaming, these
sessions may be DASH streaming sessions, progressive download sessions,
or any other type of media streaming or distribution (e.g. HLS)
sessions. For uplink media streaming, the content format and delivery
protocol are defined by the 5GMSu Application Provider, and may be
either non-fully standardized or employ standardized HTTP-based
streaming of ISO BMFF content fragments as profiled by CMAF \[39\].

The M1 interface offers three different sets of procedures:

\- For downlink media streaming, configuration of content ingest at M2d
for onward distribution over M4d by the 5GMSd AS: designed as an API
that is equivalent to the functionality of a public CDN. For uplink
media streaming, configuration of content egest at M2u for the media
content received by the 5GMSu AS from the 5GMSu Client over M4u. The
resource types involved in content hosting configuration are
provisioning session (see clause 4.3.2), content hosting procedures (see
clause 4.3.3), ingest protocols (see clause 4.3.4), content preparation
template (see clause 4.3.5), and server certificates (see clause 4.3.6).

\- Configuration of dynamic policies: allows the configuration of Policy
Templates at M5 that can be applied to M4 downlink/uplink media
streaming sessions.

\- Configuration of reporting: permits the MNO to collect, at M5, QoE
metrics and consumption reports about M4 downlink sessions, as well as
permits the MNO to collect, at M5, QoE metrics reports about M4 uplink
sessions.

A 5GMS Application Provider may use any of these procedures, in any
combination, to support its media streaming sessions.

### 4.3.2 Provisioning Session procedures

#### 4.3.2.1 General

Prior to configuring content hosting, dynamic policies, or reporting,
the 5GMS Application Provider shall create a new Provisioning Session.
The following CRUD operations are used to manage a provisioning session.

#### 4.3.2.2 Create Provisioning Session

This procedure is used by the 5GMS Application Provider to create a new
Provisioning Session. The 5GMS Application Provider shall use the HTTP
POST method to create a new Provisioning Session. Upon successful
creation, the 5GMS AF shall respond with a *201 (Created)* response
message that includes the resource identifier of the newly created
Provisioning Session in the body of the reply and the URL of the
resource, including its resource identifier, shall be returned as part
of the HTTP Location header field.

#### 4.3.2.3 Read Provisioning Session properties

This procedure is used by the 5GMS Application Provider to obtain the
properties of the Provisioning Session from the 5GMS AF. The 5GMS
Application Provider uses the GET method for this purpose.

#### 4.3.2.4 Update Provisioning Session properties

The Update operation is not allowed on Provisioning Sessions.

#### 4.3.2.5 Destroy Provisioning Session

This procedure is used by the 5GMS Application Provider to destroy a
Provisioning Session. The 5GMS AF will release any associated resources,
purge any cached data, delete all QoS and reporting configurations
associated with this Provisioning Session. The 5GMS AF shall use the
HTTP DELETE method for this purpose.

### 4.3.3 Content Hosting Provisioning procedures

#### 4.3.3.1 General

These procedures are used by the 5GMSd Application Provider and the
5GMSd AF on M1d to provision the content hosting feature for downlink
streaming.

#### 4.3.3.2 Create Content Hosting Configuration

This procedure is used by the 5GMSd Application Provider to create a new
Content Hosting Configuration. The 5GMSd Application Provider shall use
the HTTP POST method for this purpose and the request message body shall
include a *ContentHostingConfiguration* resource, as specified in
clause 7.6.3.1.

\- If the Content Hosting Configuration uses the Pull-based content
ingest method, i.e. the *pull* attribute is set to True, then the
*IngestConfiguration.baseURL* property shall be nominated by the 5GMSd
Application Provider in the request message body.

\- If the Content Hosting Configuration uses the Push-based content
ingest method, i.e. the *pull* attribute is set to False, then the
*IngestConfiguration.baseURL* property shall be nominated by the
5GMSd AF and returned in the response message body. It shall not be set
by the 5GMSd Application Provider in the request message body.

In all cases, the *DistributionConfiguration.baseURL* property is
read-only: it shall be omitted from the creation request and shall be
assigned by the 5GMSd AF, allowing the value to be inspected by the
5GMSd Application Provider in the returned *ContentHostingConfiguration*
resource representation, or by using the procedure specified in
clause 4.3.3.3 below.

If the procedure is successful, the 5GMSd AF shall generate a resource
identifier representing the new Content Hosting Configuration. In this
case, the 5GMSd AF shall respond with a *201 (Created)* HTTP response
message and shall provide the URL to the newly created resource in the
Location header field. The response message body may include a
*ContentHostingConfiguration* resource (see clause 7.6.3.1) that
represents the current state of the Content Hosting Configuration,
including any fields set by the 5GMSd AF.

If the procedure is not successful, the 5GMSd AF shall provide a
response code as defined in clause 6.3.

#### 4.3.3.3 Read Content Hosting Configuration properties

This procedure is used by the 5GMSd Application Provider to obtain the
properties of an existing Content Hosting Configuration resource from
the 5GMSd AF. The HTTP GET method shall be used for this purpose.

If the procedure is successful, the 5GMSd AF shall respond with a *200
(OK)* response message that includes the *ContentHostingConfiguration*
resource in the response message body.

If the procedure is not successful, the 5GMSd AF shall provide a
response code as defined in clause 6.3.

#### 4.3.3.4 Update Content Hosting Configuration properties

The update operation is invoked by the 5GMSd Application Provider to
modify the properties of an existing *ContentHostingConfiguration*
resource. All writeable properties except *domainNameAlias* may be
updated. The HTTP PATCH or HTTP PUT methods shall be used for the update
operation.

If the procedure is successful, the 5GMSd AF shall respond with a *200
(OK)* and provide the content of the resource in the response,
confirming the successful update operation.

If the procedure is not successful, the 5GMSd AF shall provide a
response code as defined in clause 6.3.

#### 4.3.3.5 Destroy Content Hosting Configuration

This operation is used by the 5GMS Application Provider to destroy a
Content Hosting Configuration resource and to terminate the related
distribution. The HTTP DELETE method shall be used for this purpose. As
a result, the 5GMS AF will release any associated network resources,
purge any cached content, and delete any corresponding configurations.

If the procedure is successful, the 5GMSd AF shall respond with a *200
(OK)* response message.

If the procedure is not successful, the 5GMSd AF shall provide a
response code as defined in clause 6.3.

### 4.3.4 Content Protocols Discovery procedures

#### 4.3.4.1 General

The set of downlink content ingest or uplink content egest protocols
supported by the 5GMS AS at interface M2 is described by the
*ContentProtocols* resource at M1, as specified in clause 7.5.3.1.

#### 4.3.4.2 Create Content Protocols

The Create operation is not permitted for the *ContentProtocols*
resource.

#### 4.3.4.3 Read Content Protocols

This procedure is used by the 5GMS Application Provider to retrieve a
list of content ingest protocols supported by the 5GMS AS. The HTTP GET
method shall be used for this purpose.

If the procedure is successful, the 5GMS AF shall respond with a *200
(OK)* response that includes a *ContentProtocols* resource in the
response message body, as specified in clause 7.5.3.1. If the procedure
is not successful, the 5GMS AF shall provide a response code as defined
in clause 6.3.

#### 4.3.4.4 Update Ingest Protocols

The Update operation is not permitted for the *ContentProtocols*
resource.

#### 4.3.4.5 Destroy Ingest Protocols

The Delete operation is not permitted for the *ContentProtocols*
resource.

### 4.3.5 Content Preparation Template Provisioning procedures

#### 4.3.5.1 General

For downlink media streaming, the 5GMSd AS may be required to process
content ingested at interface M2d before serving it on interface M4d.
For uplink media streaming, the 5GMSu AS may be required to process
content it receives from the 5GMSu Client before passing it to the 5GMSu
Application Provider on the egest interface M2u. The content processing
operations are specified in a Content Preparation Template resource, as
specified in clause 7.4.2.

#### 4.3.5.2 Create Content Preparation Template

This procedure is used by the 5GMS Application Provider to register a
new Content Preparation Template with a Provisioning Session. The 5GMS
Application Provider shall use the HTTP POST method to upload a new
Content Preparation Template resource. The MIME content type of the
Content Preparation Template shall be supplied in the Content-Type HTTP
request header.

Upon successful creation, the 5GMS AF shall respond with a *201
(Created)* response message and the URL of the newly created resource,
including its resource identifier, shall be returned as part of the HTTP
Location header field.

If the MIME content type indicated in Content-Type is not understood by
the 5GMS AF, the creation of the Content Preparation Template resource
shall fail with HTTP error response status code *422 (Unprocessable
entity)*.

If the 5GMS AF is unable to provision the resources indicated in the
supplied Content Preparation Template, the creation operation shall fail
with an HTTP response status code of *503 (Service Unavailable)*.

If the procedure is not successful, the 5GMS AF shall provide a response
code as defined in clause 6.3.

#### 4.3.5.3 Read Content Preparation Template

This procedure is used by the 5GMS Application Provider to download a
copy of a Content Preparation Template resource from the 5GMS AF. The
5GMS Application Provider shall use the GET method for this purpose.

If the procedure is successful, the 5GMS AF shall respond with *200
(OK)* and shall provide the requested resource in the HTTP message
response body. The Content-Type response header shall have the same
value as that supplied when the Content Preparation Template resource
was created.

If the procedure is not successful, the 5GMS AF shall provide a response
code as defined in clause 6.3.

#### 4.3.5.4 Update Content Preparation Template

The update procedure is used by the 5GMS Application Provider to modify
or replace an existing Content Preparation Template resource. The HTTP
PATCH or HTTP PUT methods shall be used for the update operation.

If the procedure is successful, the 5GMS AF shall respond with a *200
(OK)* and provide the content of the resource in the response,
reflecting the successful update operation.

If the procedure is not successful, the 5GMS AF shall provide a response
code as defined in clause 6.3.

#### 4.3.5.5 Destroy Content Preparation Template

This operation is used by the 5GMS Application Provider to destroy a
Content Preparation Template resource. The HTTP DELETE method shall be
used for this purpose.

If the procedure is successful, the 5GMS AF shall respond with a *200
(OK)* response message.

If the procedure is not successful, the 5GMS AF shall provide a response
code as defined in clause 6.3. If the Content Preparation Template is in
use as part of a Content Hosting Configuration, the procedure shall fail
with HTTP error response status code *409 (Conflict)*.

### 4.3.6 Server Certificate Provisioning procedures

#### 4.3.6.1 General

Each X.509 server certificate \[8\] presented by the 5GMSd AS at
interface M4d is represented by a Server Certificate resource at M1d.
The Server Certificates Provisioning API as specified in clause 7.3
enables a Server Certificate resource to be created within the scope of
a Provisioning Session, and subsequently referenced by a Content Hosting
Configuration created in the scope of the same Provisioning Session.
That API supports two alternative provisioning methods for Server
Certificate resources: one in which a certificate is generated by the
5GMS System operator on behalf of the 5GMSd Application Provider; the
other in which a certificate is generated by the 5GMSd Application
Provider from a Certificate Signing Request solicited from the 5GMSd AF.
Both methods shall be supported by implementations of the 5GMSd AF.

#### 4.3.6.2 Create Server Certificate

This procedure is used by the 5GMSd Application Provider to request that
the 5GMS System generates a new X.509 certificate on its behalf within
the scope of a Provisioning Session. In this case, the certificate\'s
Common Name (*CN*) is assigned in a domain under the control of the
5GMSd System operator and the use of supplementary domain name aliases
is not supported.

The 5GMSd Application Provider shall use the HTTP POST method to create
a new Server Certificate resource. Upon successful creation, the
5GMSd AF shall respond with a *201 (Created)* response message and the
URL of the resource, including its resource identifier, shall be
returned in the HTTP Location header. The response message body may
optionally include a copy of the X.509 certificate corresponding to the
newly created Server Certificate resource, as specified in
clause 7.3.3.2.

NOTE: The X.509 certificate corresponding to the newly created Server
Certificate resource may not be available immediately for interrogation
and use. See clause 4.3.6.4 below for more details.

If the procedure is not successful, the 5GMSd AF shall provide a
response code as defined in clause 6.3.

#### 4.3.6.3 Reserve Server Certificate

This procedure is used by the 5GMSd Application Provider to solicit a
Certificate Signing Request from the 5GMSd AF for the purpose of
generating an X.509 certificate independently of the 5GMSd System. In
this case, the certificate\'s Common Name (*CN*) is assigned in a domain
under the control of the 5GMSd Application Provider itself, or that of a
third party acting on its behalf. The 5GMSd Application Provider shall
separately arrange for the FQDN carried in the Common Name of the
certificate generated, or that of a Subject Alternative Name
(*subjectAltName*) extension in the same certificate (see
section 4.2.1.6 of RFC 5280 \[20\]), to resolve to the address of a
5GMSd AS in the target 5GMS System.

The 5GMSd Application Provider may specify additional domain name
aliases in its certificate reservation request to the 5GMSd AF. If
provided, these shall be included in the returned Certificate Signing
Request using the Subject Alternative Name (*subjectAltName*) extension
(see section 4.2.1.6 of RFC 5280 \[20\]). In this case, the 5GMSd
Application Provider is responsible for ensuring that these FQDN aliases
resolve to the Common Name of the 5GMSd AS in the target 5GMS System.

The 5GMSd Application Provider shall use the HTTP POST method to create
a new Server Certificate. Upon successful creation of the resource, the
5GMSd AF shall respond with a *201 (Created)* response message and the
URL of the resource, including its resource identifier, shall be
returned in the HTTP Location header. The Content‑Type response header
and the body of the HTTP response message shall be as specified in
clause 7.3.3.1.

If the procedure is not successful, the 5GMSd AF shall provide a
response code as defined in clause 6.3.

#### 4.3.6.4 Retrieve Server Certificate

This procedure is used by the 5GMSd Application Provider to download a
Server Certificate resource for inspection. The HTTP GET method shall be
used for this purpose. If the requested resource exists and is populated
with an X.509 certificate, the 5GMSd AF shall respond with *200 (OK)*
and shall return the requested Server Certificate in accordance with
clause 7.3.3.2.

In the case where the X.509 certificate was provisioned by the 5GMSd
System on behalf of the 5GMSd Application Provider according to
clause 4.3.6.2 above, the HTTP response *503 (Service Unavailable)*
shall be returned until such time as the X.509 certificate is generated
and available for download. The optional HTTP response header
Retry-After should be included in such a response, indicating when the
certificate is expected to become available for inspection and use.

In cases where the X.509 certificate is to be generated by the 5GMSd
Application Provider from a Certificate Signing Request obtained
according to clause 4.3.6.3 above, the HTTP response *204 (No Content)*
shall be returned until such time as the X.509 certificate has been
uploaded using the procedure specified in clause 4.3.6.5 below.

#### 4.3.6.5 Upload Server Certificate

This procedure is used by a 5GMSd Application Provider to upload an
X.509 certificate that it has generated in response to a Certificate
Signing Request solicited using the reservation procedure specified in
clause 4.3.6.3 above. The HTTP PUT method shall be used for this
purpose. The Content‑Type request header and the body of the HTTP
request message shall be as specified in clause 7.3.3.2.

Before accepting the supplied X.509 certificate, the 5GMSd AF shall
verify that the party originating the upload is the same party that
reserved the Server Certificate resource using the procedure specified
in clause 4.3.6.3 above. If there is a mismatch, the HTTP response *403
(Forbidden)* shall be returned.

Attempting to upload an X.509 certificate to a Server Certificate
resource that has not been reserved shall elicit a *404 (Not Found)*
HTTP response.

#### 4.3.6.6 Update Server Certificate

Updating a previously uploaded Server Certificate is not permitted for
security reasons. Any attempt to do so using the PUT method shall result
in the HTTP response *405* *(Method Not Allowed)*.

To supply a replacement X.509 certificate, for example when a previously
supplied certificate is shortly due to expire, the 5GMSd Application
Provider should instead use one of the procedures specified in
clause 4.3.6.2 or 4.3.6.3 above to create or reserve a new Server
Certificate resource and, once the certificate is available for use,
update the Content Hosting Configuration to reference it.

#### 4.3.6.7 Destroy Server Certificate

This procedure is used to remove a Server Certificate resource from a
Provisioning Session. The HTTP DELETE method shall be used for this
purpose. On success, the HTTP response *200 (OK)* or *204 (No content)*
shall be returned and afterwards the identifier of the Service
Certificate resource is no longer valid.

Only the party that created (see clause 4.3.6.2) or reserved (see
clause 4.3.6.3) the Server Certificate resource is permitted to destroy
it. Any attempt by another party to destroy a Server Certificate
resource shall elicit the HTTP response *405 (Method Not Allowed)*.

The HTTP response *409 (Conflict)* shall be returned if an attempt is
made to destroy a Server Certificate resource that is currently
referenced by a Content Hosting Configuration resource.

Attempting to destroy a Server Certificate resource that has been
reserved but never uploaded shall elicit a *200 (OK)* HTTP response. In
this case, the 5GMSd AF should release any resources associated with the
reservation.

If the procedure is not successful, the 5GMSd AF shall provide a
response code as defined in clause 6.3.

### 4.3.7 Dynamic Policy Provisioning procedures

#### 4.3.7.1 General

These procedures are used by the 5GMS Application Provider to configure
the Policy Templates for streaming sessions of a particular Provisioning
Session.

Figure 4.3.7.1‑1 below is a state diagram showing the life-cycle of a
Policy Template resource.

Figure 4.3.7.1‑1: Policy Template Resource State Diagram

Since Policy Templates require 5GMS System operator verification, a
Policy Template resource that is newly created cannot be used
immediately. Upon creation, a Policy Template resource shall be in the
*PENDING* state. Once all mandatory properties are provided, the 5GMS AF
triggers validation. If the Policy Template is not deemed to be valid by
the operator of the 5GMS System, it shall move to the *INVALID* state,
from where it can be updated to remedy the defect. Once it has been
successfully validated by the 5GMS System operator, a Policy Template
resource shall take the *READY* state, indicating that it may be applied
to media streaming sessions. If it is subsequently updated by the 5GMS
Application Provider, a Policy Template resource shall return to the
*PENDING* state, awaiting revalidation by the operator of the 5GMS
System. Finally, a Policy Template resource may be *SUSPENDED* by the
5GMS System operator, e.g. in case of a violation of the usage terms or
for some other reasons, which renders it unusable. The update of any
property moves the state into *PENDING* and triggers revalidation.

A Policy Template resource may be destroyed when it is in any of the
abovementioned states.

The 5GMS AF shall verify the status of a Policy Template resource prior
to allowing a Dynamic Policy Instance to instantiate it. Only a Policy
Template resource in the *READY* state is eligible to be instantiated in
this way.

The 5GMS AF shall indicate the current state of a Policy Template in the
Policy Template resource in machine-readable form as well as indicating
a human-readable reason for this state.

#### 4.3.7.2 Create Policy Template

This procedure is used by the 5GMS Application Provider to create a new
Policy Template resource. The HTTP POST method shall be used for this
purpose.

If the procedure is successful, the 5GMS AF shall generate a resource
identifier to uniquely identify the newly created Policy Template
resource. In that case, it shall respond with a *201 (Created)* HTTP
response message and provide the URL to the newly created resource in
the Location header field.

If the procedure is not successful, the 5GMS AF shall provide a response
code as defined in clause 6.3.

The default state of a newly created Policy Template resource is
*PENDING*. If all mandatory property values have been provided, the
Policy Template resource is eligible for validation.

#### 4.3.7.3 Read Policy Template

This procedure is used by the 5GMS Application Provider and other 5GMS
AFs to query the properties of an existing Policy Template resource from
the 5GMS AF. The HTTP GET method shall be used for this purpose.

If the procedure is successful, the 5GMS AF shall respond with a *200
(OK)* response that includes a copy of the Policy Template resource in
the response message body.

If the procedure is not successful, the 5GMS AF shall provide a response
code as defined in clause 6.3.

#### 4.3.7.4 Update Policy Template

The update operation is invoked by the 5GMS Application Provider to
modify the properties of an existing Policy Template resource. All
available properties except *state* may be updated. The HTTP PATCH or
HTTP PUT methods shall be used for the update operation.

Any update to the Policy Template resource will change its state back to
*PENDING*, which makes it temporarily unusable. If all mandatory
property values have been provided, the Policy Template is eligible for
revalidation.

If the procedure is successful, the 5GMS AF shall respond with a *200
(OK)* response message that includes a copy of the Policy Template
resource in the response message body. Modifications to read-only
properties, such as changes to the state of a Policy Template, shall be
rejected with a *403 (Forbidden)* HTTP response.

If the procedure is not successful, the 5GMS AF shall provide a response
code as defined in clause 6.3.

#### 4.3.7.5 Destroy Policy Template

This operation is used by the 5GMS Application Provider to destroy a
Policy Template resource. The HTTP DELETE method shall be used for this
purpose. As a result, the 5GMS AF will remove the Policy Template from
any Provisioning Sessions that reference it.

Currently active media streaming sessions using the destroyed Policy
Template, if any exist, shall be stopped by the removal of the Policy
Template.

If the procedure is successful, the 5GMS AF shall respond with a *200
(OK)* response message.

If the procedure is not successful, the 5GMS AF shall provide a response
code as defined in clause 6.3.

### 4.3.8 Consumption Reporting Configuration procedures

#### 4.3.8.1 General

These procedures are used by the 5GMSd Application Provider to activate
and to configure consumption reporting. This clause defines the basic
procedures. More details are provided in clause 7.7.

#### 4.3.8.2 Create Consumption Reporting Configuration

This procedure is used by the 5GMSd Application Provider to activate
consumption reporting for a particular Provisioning Session. The 5GMSd
Application Provider shall use the HTTP POST method to activate the
consumption reporting procedure and to transmit the Consumption
Reporting Configuration to the 5GMSd AF. Upon successful operation, the
5GMSd AF shall respond with a *201 (Created)* response message and the
same resource URL shall be returned in the Location header field.

If the procedure is not successful, the 5GMSd AF shall provide a
response code as defined in clause 6.3.

#### 4.3.8.3 Read Consumption Reporting Configuration

This procedure is used by the 5GMSd Application Provider to obtain the
current Consumption Reporting Configuration from the 5GMSd AF. The 5GMSd
Application Provider uses the GET method for this purpose.

#### 4.3.8.4 Update Consumption Reporting Configuration

The update operation is invoked by the 5GMSd Application Provider to
modify the current Consumption Reporting Configuration. All available
parameters may be updated. The HTTP PATCH or HTTP PUT methods shall be
used for the update operation.

If the procedure is successful, the 5GMSd AF shall respond with a *200
(OK)* reflecting the successful update operation.

If the procedure is not successful, the 5GMSd AF shall provide a
response code as defined in clause 6.3.

#### 4.3.8.5 Destroy Consumption Reporting Configuration

This operation is used by the 5GMSd Application Provider to terminate
the related consumption reporting procedure. The HTTP DELETE method
shall be used for this purpose. As a result, the 5GMSd AF will release
any associated resources, purge any cached data, and delete any
corresponding configurations.

If the procedure is successful, the 5GMSd AF shall respond with a *200
(OK)* response message. If the procedure is not successful, the 5GMSd AF
shall provide a response code as defined in clause 6.3.

### 4.3.9 Metrics Reporting Provisioning procedures

#### 4.3.9.1 General

These procedures are used by the 5GMS Application Provider to configure
QoE metrics reporting functionality associated with downlink or uplink
media streaming. This clause defines the basic procedures. More details
are provided in clause 7.8.3.1.

A given instance of a Metrics Reporting Configuration resource is
identified by the *metricsReportingConfigurationId* property of the
*MetricsReportingConfiguration* resource, The properties of that
resource, as described in clause 7.8.3.1, pertain to metrics collection
and reporting by the Media Session Handler to the 5GMS AF.

#### 4.3.9.2 Create Metrics Reporting Configuration

This procedure is used by the 5GMS Application Provider to create a
Metrics Reporting Configuration resource for a particular Provisioning
Session. The 5GMS Application Provider shall use the HTTP POST method
for this purpose and the request message body may include a
*MetricsReportingConfiguration* resource, as specified in clause
7.8.3.1. Upon successful operation, the 5GMS AF shall respond with a
*201 (Created)* response message and the resource URL for the
newly-created Metrics Reporting Configuration resource shall be returned
in the Location header field. If the procedure is unsuccessful, the 5GMS
AF shall provide a response code as defined in clause 6.3.

This procedure may be performed multiple times to provision different
Metrics Reporting Configurations in the scope of a particular
Provisioning Session. Each such configuration resource is represented by
a different value of *metricsReportingConfigurationId*.

#### 4.3.9.3 Read Metrics Reporting Configuration

This procedure is used by the 5GMS Application Provider to obtain the
properties of an existing Metrics Reporting Configuration resource from
the 5GMS AF. The 5GMS Application Provider shall use the GET method for
this purpose. If successful, the 5GMS AF shall respond with a *200 (OK)*
and the requested *MetricsReportingConfiguration* resource (see
clause 7.8.3.1) shall be returned in the body of the HTTP response
message. If the procedure is unsuccessful, the 5GMS AF shall provide a
response code as defined in clause 6.3.

#### 4.3.9.4 Update Metrics Reporting Configuration

The update operation is invoked by the 5GMS Application Provider to
initially upload the Metrics Reporting Configuration resource, or in the
case of an existing Metrics Reporting Configuration resource, to
entirely replace or modify certain properties of that resource. All
available properties may be updated. The HTTP PATCH or HTTP PUT methods
shall be used for the update operation.

If the procedure is successful, the 5GMS AF shall respond with a *200
(OK)* reflecting the successful update operation. If the procedure is
unsuccessful, the 5GMS AF shall provide a response code as defined in
clause 6.3.

#### 4.3.9.5 Destroy Metrics Reporting Configuration

This operation is used by the 5GMS Application Provider to destroy a
Metrics Reporting Configuration resource and to terminate the related
metrics reporting procedure. The HTTP DELETE method shall be used for
this purpose. As a result, the 5GMS AF should release any associated
resources, discard any pending metrics reports, and delete any
corresponding configurations.

If the procedure is successful, the 5GMS AF shall respond with a *200
(OK)* response message. If the procedure is unsuccessful, the 5GMS AF
shall provide a response code as defined in clause 6.3.

4.4 Procedures of the M2d (5GMS content ingest) interface
---------------------------------------------------------

The following 5GMS AS content ingest protocols are specified by the
present document at reference point M2d to support downlink media
streaming:

\- An *HTTP pull-based content ingest protocol* is specified in
clause 8.2, including specific handling for HTTP redirects issued to the
5GMS AS by the 5GMS Application Provider\'s origin server.

\- A *DASH-IF push-based content ingest protocol* is specified in
clause 8.3.

4.5 Procedures of the M3d interface
-----------------------------------

Interface M3d is internal and no procedures on this interface are
specified.

4.6 Procedures of the M4d (Media Streaming) interface
-----------------------------------------------------

### 4.6.1 Procedures for DASH Session

This procedure is used by a 5GMSd Client to establish a DASH session via
the M4d interface. In order to establish such a session, the 5GMSd AS
shall host an MPD as defined in ISO/IEC 23009-1 \[32\] or TS 26.247
\[4\] and the MPD URL is known to the 5GMSd Client typically using M8d.

The Media Player receives an MPD URL from the 5GMSd-Aware Application
through M7d by methods defined in clause 13. The Media Player shall send
an HTTP GET message to the 5GMSd AS including the URL of the MPD
resource. On success, the 5GMSd AS shall respond with a *200 (OK)*
message that includes the requested MPD resource.

Additional procedures for reactions to different HTTP status codes are
provided in TS 26.247 \[4\], clause A.7 and ISO/IEC 23009-1 \[32\]
clause A.7.

Additional procedures for handling partial file responses are provided
in TS 26.247 \[4\], clause A.9.

This information is provided through M7d to the application for
selection. In addition, the currently used service description
parameters are provided as status information through M7d in order for
the Media Session Handler to make use of this information, for example
for Dynamic Policy and Network Assistance.

The detailed handling of service description information is documented
in clause 13.2 of the present document.

### 4.6.2 Procedures for Progressive Download Session

This procedure is used by a 5GMSd client to establish a Progressive
Download session via the M4d interface. In order to establish such a
session, the 5GMSd AS shall host an 3GP/MP4 file as defined in TS
26.247 \[4\]. The 3GP/MP4 URL is known to the Media Player (in this case
a progressive download player), typically by using M8d.

The Media Player receives a URL from the 5GMSd-Aware Application through
M7d by methods defined in clause 13. The Media Player shall send an HTTP
GET message to the 5GMSd AS including the URL of the 3GP/MP4 resource.
On success, the 5GMSd AS shall respond with a *200 (OK)* message that
includes the requested 3GP/MP4 resource.

Additional procedures for reactions to different HTTP status codes are
provided in TS 26.247 \[4\].

4.7 Procedures of the M5 (Media Session Handling) interface
-----------------------------------------------------------

### 4.7.1 Introduction {#introduction-1}

The M5 APIs are used by a Media Session Handler within a 5GMS Client to
invoke services relating to downlink or uplink media streaming at the
5GMS AF.

### 4.7.2 Procedures for Service Access Information

#### 4.7.2.1 General

Service Access Information is the set of parameters and addresses needed
by the 5GMSd Client to activate reception of a downlink media streaming
session or by a 5GMSu Client to activate an uplink media streaming
session for contribution. The data model of the
*ServiceAccessInformation* resource acquired by the Media Session
Handler of the 5GMS Client is shown in clause 11.2.3. Service Access
Information additionally includes configuration information to allow the
Media Session Handler to invoke procedures for dynamic policy (see
clause 4.7.3), consumption reporting (clause 4.7.4), metrics reporting
(clause 4.7.5) and network assistance (clause 4.7.6).

\- For downlink media streaming, the Media Session Handler may obtain
Service Access Information from either the 5GMSd-Aware Application (via
M6d) or the 5GMSd AF (via M5d). In the former case, the Service Access
Information is initially acquired by the 5GMSd-Aware Application from
the 5GMSd Application Provider via M8d. In the latter case, the Service
Access Information is derived by the 5GMSd AF from the Provisioning
Session established via M1d.

Typically, the Service Access Information for downlink media streaming
includes a media entry point (e.g. a URL to a DASH MPD or a URL to a
progressive download file) that can be consumed by the Media Player and
is handed to the Media Player through M7d.

\- For uplink media streaming, the 5GMSu Client may obtain Service
Access Information from either the 5GMSu-Aware Application (via M6u/M7u)
or the 5GMSu AF (via M5u). In the former case, the Service Access
Information is initially acquired by the 5GMSu-Aware Application from
the 5GMSu Application Provider via M8u. In the latter case, the Service
Access Information is derived by the 5GMSu AF from the Provisioning
Session established via M1u.

This clause specifies the procedures whereby the 5GMS Client fetches
Service Access Information from the 5GMS AF.

#### 4.7.2.2 Create Service Access Information

The Create operation is not allowed on Service Access Information.

#### 4.7.2.3 Retrieve Service Access Information properties

This procedure shall be used by the Media Session Handler to acquire
Service Access Information from the 5GMS AF. The Media Session Handler
uses the GET method for this purpose.

The downlink or uplink media streaming session for which the Media
Session Handler is requesting data is identified by a unique reference
contained in the path of the URL, as specified in clause 11.2.2.

Once it has obtained an initial set of Service Access Information, the
Media Session Handler shall periodically check for updated Service
Access Information by issuing a conditional HTTP GET request containing
either:

> \- an If-None-Match request header with the value of the entity tag
> (ETag) that was returned with the most recently acquired
> *ServiceAccessInformation* resource; or else
>
> \- an If-Modified-Since request header with the Last-Modified value of
> that most recently acquired resource.

The periodicity of polling for updated Service Access Information shall
be guided by the value of the Expires and/or Cache-control: max-age
headers that shall be included along with every response message for
this procedure.

#### 4.7.2.4 Update Service Access Information properties

The Update operation is not allowed on Service Access Information.

#### 4.7.2.5 Destroy Service Access Information properties

The Destroy operation is not allowed on Service Access Information.

### 4.7.3 Procedures for dynamic policy invocation

This procedure is used by a Media Session Handler to manage Dynamic
Policy Instance resources via the M5 interface. A dynamic policy
invocation consists of a Policy Template Id, flow description(s), a 5GMS
Application Service Configuration Id and potentially other parameters,
according to TS 26.501 clause 5.7.

A Policy Template Id identifies the desired Policy Template to be
applied to an application flow. A Policy Template includes properties
such as specific QoS (e.g. background data) or different charging
treatments. The 5GMS AF combines the information from the Policy
Template with dynamic information from the Media Session Handler to
gather a complete set of parameters to invoke the N33 or N5 API call.
The Policy Template may contain for example the AF identifier.

The flow description allows the identification and classification of the
media traffic, such as the packet filter sets given in clause 5.7.6 of
\[2\].

In order to instantiate a new dynamic policy, the Media Session Handler
shall first create a resource for the Dynamic Policy Instance on the
5GMS AF. When the Media Session Handler needs several dynamic policies,
it repeats the step as often as needed.

The Media Session Handler creates a new Dynamic Policy Instance by
sending an HTTP POST message to the 5GMS AF. The body of the HTTP POST
message shall include a Provisioning Session Id, the Policy Template Id
and the Service Data Flow description. The Service Data Flow description
identifies the actual application flow(s) to be policed according to the
Policy Template. If the operation is successful, the 5GMS AF creates a
new resource URL representing the Dynamic Policy Instance. In this case,
the 5GMS AF shall respond to the Media Session Handler with a *201
Created* HTTP response message, including the URL for the newly created
Dynamic Policy Instance resource as the value of the Location header
field.

When the Dynamic Policy Instance is successfully instantiated, the 5GMS
AF triggers the creation of a corresponding policy in the 5G System.
Depending on the selected *sdfMethod*, the 5GMS AF fills in a
*flowDescription* object and / or provides an application identifier
referring to a *PFD* (Packet Flow Description) object containing the
domain name.

NOTE 1: It is not defined in this Release how a 5GMS AF in an external
Data Network provides an application identifier.

NOTE 2: It is not defined in this Release how a 5GMS AF in an external
Data Network selects a specific DNN or S‑NSSAI.The Media Session Handler
can modify the parameters of an existing Dynamic Policy Instance
resource using either the HTTP PUT or PATCH methods, as appropriate to
the desired update. The 5GMS AF shall trigger the appropriate actions
towards other Network Functions like PCF or NEF when all information is
set.

The Media Session Handler can destroy a Dynamic Policy Instance resource
using the HTTP DELETE method. As a result, the 5GMS AF shall trigger the
appropriate actions towards other Network Functions like PCF or NEF to
remove the associated PCC rule.

### 4.7.4 Procedures for consumption reporting

These procedures are used by the Media Session Handler and the
Consumption Reporting functions of the 5GMSd Client to submit a
consumption report via the M5d interface if Consumption Reporting is
applied for a downlink streaming session.

The Service Access Information indicating whether Consumption Reporting
is provisioned for downlink streaming sessions is described in clause
11.2.3. When the
*clientConsumptionReportingConfiguration.samplePercentage* value is 100,
the Media Session Handler shall activate the consumption reporting
procedure. If the *samplePercentage* is less than 100, the Media Session
Handler shall generate a random number which is uniformly distributed in
the range of 0 to 100, and the Media Session Handler shall activate the
consumption report procedure when the generated random number is of a
lower value than the *samplePercentage* value.

If the consumption reporting procedure is activated, the Media Session
Handler shall produce and submit a consumption report to the 5GMSd AF
when any of the following conditions occur:

> \- Start of consumption of a downlink streaming session;
>
> \- Stop of consumption of a downlink streaming session;
>
> \- Upon determining the need to report ongoing 5GMS consumption at
> periodic intervals determined by the
> *clientConsumptionReportingConfiguration.reportingInterval* property.
>
> \- Upon determining a location change, if the
> *clientConsumptionReportingConfiguration.locationReporting* property
> is set to *True*.

Whenever a consumption report is produced, the Media Session Handler
shall reset its reporting interval timer to the value of the
c*lient‌Consumption‌Reporting‌Configuration.‌reportingInterval* property
and it shall begin countdown of the timer again. Whenever the Media
Session Handler stops the consumption of a downlink streaming session,
it shall disable its reporting interval timer.

In order to submit a consumption report, the Media Session Handler shall
send an HTTP POST message to the 5GMSd AF. If several 5GMSd AF addresses
are listed in the
c*lient‌Consumption‌Reporting‌Configuration.‌serverAddresses* array (see
table 11.2.3.1-1), the Media Session Handler shall choose one at random
and shall send the consumption report to the selected server endpoint.
The request body shall be a *ConsumptionReport* structure, as specified
in clause 11.3.3.1. The server shall respond with a *200 (OK)* message
to acknowledge successful processing of the consumption report.

NOTE: If the connection via M5d for consumption reporting is temporarily
unavailable, the consumption reports are expected to be stored on the UE
for some time until connectivity to the 5GMSd AF is restored and sent
later to the 5GMSd AF as a collection. Details are left to
implementation.

The Consumption Reporting API, defining the data formats and structures
and related procedures for consumption reporting, is described in clause
11.3.

A reporting client identifier shall be included in the consumption
report. If available to the Media Session Handler, its value should be a
GPSI value as defined by TS 23.003 \[7\]. Otherwise, the reporting
client identifier should be represented by a stable and globally unique
string.

### 4.7.5 Procedures for metrics reporting

The M5 procedures for QoE metrics reporting pertain to the combination
of the provisioning of metrics collection and reporting in the Media
Session Handler using relevant Service Access Information, and the
sending of collected metrics by the Media Session Handler to the 5GMS AF
in accordance with the configured metrics scheme(s). A metrics scheme
may be 3GPP-defined or non-3GPP-defined.

When the metrics collection and reporting feature is activated for a
downlink media streaming session, one or more metrics configuration
sets, each associated with a metrics scheme, may be provided to the 5GMS
Client. A given metrics configuration set contains information such as
the 5GMS AF address(es) to which metrics are to be sent by the Media
Session Handler, metrics reporting interval, target percentage of media
streaming sessions for which reports should be sent, and the set of
metrics to be collected and reported. See TS 26.501 \[2\] for additional
details.

For progressive download and DASH streaming services, the listed metrics
in a given metrics configuration set are associated with the 3GPP
metrics scheme and shall correspond to one or more of the metrics as
specified in clauses 10.3 and 10.4, respectively, of TS 26.247 \[4\].
Metrics related to virtual reality media, as specified in TS 26.118
\[42\] clause 9.3, may also be listed in the metrics configuration.

Whenever a metrics report is produced for a given metrics configuration,
the Media Session Handler shall reset its reporting interval timer for
that configuration to the value of the
c*lientMetrics‌Reporting‌Configurations\[\].‌reportingInterval* property
and it shall begin countdown of the timer again. Whenever the Media
Session Handler stops the consumption of a downlink streaming session,
it shall disable its reporting interval timer for all metrics
configurations.

In order to submit a metrics report, the Media Session Handler shall
send an HTTP POST message to the 5GMS AF. If several 5GMS AF addresses
are listed in the
c*lientMetrics‌Reporting‌Configurations\[\].‌serverAddresses* array (see
table 11.2.3.1-1), the Media Session Handler shall choose one at random
and shall send the metrics report to the selected server endpoint. The
request body shall be formatted according to the metrics scheme
indicated in
*clientMetrics‌Reporting‌Configurations\[\].‌metrics‌Reporting‌ConfigurationId*
(see table 11.2.3.1-1), as specified in clause 11.4.3. The server shall
respond with a *200 (OK)* message to acknowledge successful processing
of the metrics report.

NOTE: If the connection via M5 for metrics reporting is temporarily
unavailable, the metrics reports are expected to be stored on the UE for
some time until connectivity to 5GMS AF is restored and sent later to
the 5GMS AF as a collection. Details are left to implementation.

Details of the metrics reporting API are provided in clause 11.4, and
for 3GP-DASH based downlink media streaming services, the 3GPP-defined
metrics reporting scheme and metrics report format are defined in clause
11.4.3.

A reporting client identifier may be included in the metrics report. If
available to the Media Session Handler, its value should be a GPSI value
as defined by TS 23.003 \[7\]. Otherwise, the reporting client
identifier should be represented by a stable and globally unique string.

### 4.7.6 Procedures for network assistance

These procedures are used by the 5GMS Client to request Network
Assistance from one of the 5GMS AF instances listed in the
*networkAssistanceConfiguration.serverAddresses* property of the Service
Access Information resource retrieved using the procedure in
clause 4.7.2.3. Details of the APIs supporting these procedures are
specified in clause 11.6.

The 5GMS Client first creates a Network Assistance Session with its
chosen 5GMS AF instance. It provides information that will later be used
by the 5GMS AF to request a particular network QoS to be applied by the
PCF to one or more application data flows, and to recommend a bit rate
to the 5GMS Client. This procedure is further specified in
clause 11.6.4.1.

The *NetworkAssistanceSession* resource may be retrieved by the Media
Session Handler using the procedure specified in clause 11.6.4.2.

When a Network Assistance Session is created, the responding 5GMS AF
instance may nominate an MQTT endpoint URL in the
*NetworkAssistanceSession.notificationURL* property. The Media Session
Handler may subscribe to the MQTT channel provided at this endpoint and
receive notifications with an up-to-date bit rate recommendation
whenever this changes.

At any time after the Network Assistance Session resource is created,
the 5GMS Client may use the Network Assistance Session identifier to
explicitly request a bit rate recommendation by invoking a remote
procedure call provided for this purpose by the 5GMS AF. This procedure
is further specified in clause 11.6.4.3.

Using the Network Assistance identifier, the 5GMS Client may also
request a delivery boost to be provided by the 5G System at any time by
invoking a remote procedure call provided for this purpose by the
5GMS AF. This procedure is further specified in clause 11.6.4.4.

The information provided when first creating a Network Assistance
Session may be modified subsequently by the Media Session Handler using
the session modification procedure specified in clause 11.6.4.5.

In order to terminate a Network Assistance Session, the 5GMS Client
deletes the Network Assistance session resource. This procedure is
further specified in clause 11.6.4.6.

4.8 Procedures of the M6d (UE Media Session Handling) interface
---------------------------------------------------------------

### 4.8.1 General

This clause contains the procedures for the interaction between the
5GMSd-Aware application or the Media Player and the Media Session
Handler through the M6d API. Details are provided in clause 12.

### 4.8.2 Consumption reporting procedures

Before a streaming session is started, the Media Session Handler shall
check if the Service Access Information contains any Consumption
reporting configuration, as specified in clause 4.7.3. If such a
configuration is present, the Media Session Handler shall initiate
consumption reporting based on this configuration for the current
streaming session.

The Media Session Handler shall first determine whether consumption
reporting is active for the session. The determination shall be based on
the *samplePercentage* attribute specified in the consumption reporting
configuration. When the *samplePercentage* is not present or its value
is 100, consumption reporting is active for the session. If the
*samplePercentage* is less than 100, the Media Session Handler generates
a random number which is uniformly distributed in the range 0 to100;
consumption reporting is active for the session when the generated
random number is of a lower value than the *samplePercentage* value.

If consumption reporting for this session is active, the Media Session
Handler shall regularly determine the consumption reporting parameters
defined in clause 11.3.2.4 from the Media Player through the M7d
interface and shall report these values according to the
*reportingInterval* specified in the Client Consumption Reporting
Configuration.

4.9 Procedures of the M7d (UE Media Player) interface
-----------------------------------------------------

### 4.9.1 General

This clause contains the procedures for the interaction between the
5GMSd-Aware Application or the Media Session Handler and the Media
Player through the M7d API. Details are provided in clause 13.

### 4.9.2 Metrics reporting procedures

These procedures shall be used by the Media Session Handler function to
control metrics reporting when such reporting is configured via metadata
sent in-band via the media manifest.

When a streaming session is started, the Media Session Handler shall
check if the manifest contains any metrics configuration, as specified
in TS 26.247 clauses 10.4 and 10.5, or TS 26.118 \[42\] clause 9.3. If
such a configuration is found, the Media Session Handler shall use it
for the current streaming session.

The Media Session Handler shall first determine whether metrics from
this session shall be reported. The determination shall be based on the
*samplePercentage* attribute specified in the metrics configuration,
according to TS 26.247 clause 10.5.

If metrics are reported for the session, the Media Session Handler shall
request the Media Player to create a metrics collection job. The Media
Player shall return a reference to the created job, which the Media
Session Handler shall use in all subsequent actions related to this job.

The Media Session Handler shall configure the metrics collector job with
the set of metrics which shall be collected during the session. The
format of the configuration shall be according to TS 26.247 Annex L.2,
but note that only the *metrics* attribute in the configuration shall be
used for this purpose.

The Media Session Handler shall regularly request the collected metrics
from the Media Player according to the *reportingInterval* specified in
the metrics configuration. The metrics returned by the Media Player
shall use the format as described in TS 26.247 clause 10.6, and (for
virtual reality media) in TS 26.118 \[42\] clause 9.4 and the Media
Session Handler shall forward these to the server address*(es) specified
in the metrics configuration* using the specified *DNN* according to the
procedures described in TS 26.247 clause 10.6.

When the session is finished the Media Session Handler shall delete the
metrics collection job.

4.10 Procedures of the M8d interface
------------------------------------

This clause defines basic procedures for M8d.

No specific procedures are defined but it is expected that the 5GMSd
Application Provider can provide media session entry points to a
5GMSd-Aware Application through M8d. The 5GMSd-Aware Application would
then initiate the media session by providing such an entry point to the
5GMSd Client through M7d.

5 Procedures for Uplink Media streaming
=======================================

5.1 General
-----------

Uplink media streaming functional entities in the 5GMS System include
the 5GMSu Application Provider, 5GMSu AF, 5GMSu AS and the UE. To make
use of these other entities, the UE includes a 5GMSu-Aware Application
that is provided by the 5GMS Application Provider and a 5GMSu Client
comprising the Media Session Handler and the Media Streamer.

The M1 Provisioning API enables the 5GMSu Application Provider to
establish and manage the uplink media session handling and streaming
options of the 5GMSu system.

The M2u Egest interface enables Uplink media streaming content sent by
the 5GMSu Client to the 5GMSu AS over interface M4u to be subsequently
delivered to the 5GMSu Application Provider. Uplink media streaming
media transfer from the 5GMSu AS to the 5GMSu Application Provider may
be either pull-based and initiated by the 5GMSu Application Provider
using the HTTP GET method, or push-based and initiated by the 5GMSu AS
using the HTTP PUT method. The resource identifier of the 5GMSu
Application Provider for push-based streaming content delivery is
provided to the 5GMSu AS by the 5GMSu AF over the M3u interface, as part
of the M1 Provisioning Session.

The 5GMSu AF, having acquired M1 Provisioning information, sets up the
M5 interface that the 5GMSu Client can use for Uplink media streaming
session management, remote control, metrics reporting, network
assistance and request for policy and/or charging treatment. Certain
types of configuration and policy information accessed over M5 by the
Media Session Handler, such as uplink metrics reporting, QoS policy, or
support for AF-based network assistance are further passed to the Media
Streamer via the M7u API.

Based on the configuration information received on M5 and a request from
the Media Streamer received over the M6u interface, the Media Session
Handler sets up an Uplink media streaming session with the 5GMSu AF.
Upon successful session establishment, the Media Session Handler
triggers the Media Streamer to begin Uplink media streaming of media
content to the 5GMSu AS over the M4u interface.

Subscription to status and other event notification services are offered
by the Media Session Handler to the 5GMSu-Aware Application and to the
Media Streamer via the M6u APIs exposed by the Media Session Handler.

Subscription to status and other event notification services are also
offered by the Media Streamer to the 5GMSu-Aware Application and to the
Media Session Handler via the M7u APIs exposed by the Media Player.

6 General aspects of APIs for 5G Media Streaming
================================================

6.1 HTTP resource URIs and paths
--------------------------------

The resource URI used in each HTTP request to the API provider shall
have the structure defined in subclause 4.4.1 of TS 29.501 \[22\], i.e.:

*{apiRoot}*/*{apiName}*/*{apiVersion}*/*{apiSpecificResourceUriPart}*

with the following components:

\- *{apiRoot}* shall be set as described in TS 29.501 \[22\].

\- *{apiName}* shall be set as defined by the following clauses.

\- *{apiVersion}* shall be set to \"v1\".

\- *{apiSpecificResourceUriPart}* shall be set as described in the
following clauses.

6.2 Usage of HTTP
-----------------

### 6.2.1 HTTP protocol version

#### 6.2.1.1 5GMS AF

Implementations of the 5GMS AF shall expose both HTTP/1.1 \[24\] and
HTTP/2 \[31\] endpoints at interfaces M1 and M5, including support for
the HTTP/2 starting mechanisms specified in section 3 of RFC 7540
\[31\]. In both protocol versions, TLS \[29\] shall be supported and
HTTPS interactions should be used on these interfaces in preference to
cleartext HTTP.

The 5GMS Application Provider may use any supported HTTP protocol
version at interface M1.

The Media Session Handler may use any supported HTTP protocol version at
interface M5.

All responses from the 5GMS AF that carry a message body shall include a
strong entity tag in the form of an ETag response header and a
modification timestamp in the form of a Last-Modified response header.

All endpoints shall support the conditional HTTP requests If-None-Match
and If-Modified-Since.

#### 6.2.1.2 5GMS AS

Implementations of the 5GMS AS shall expose HTTP/1.1 \[24\] endpoints at
interfaces M2 and M4 and may additionally expose HTTP/2 \[31\] endpoints
at these interfaces. In both protocol versions, TLS \[30\] shall be
supported and HTTPS interactions should be used on these interfaces in
preference to cleartext HTTP.

For pull-based content ingest, the 5GMS Application Provider shall
expose an HTTP/1.1-based origin endpoint to the 5GMSd AS at interface M2
and may additionally expose an HTTP/2-based origin endpoint.

For push-based content ingest, the 5GMS Application Provider may use any
supported HTTP protocol version at interface M2.

The Media Stream Handler may use any supported HTTP protocol version at
interface M4.

### 6.2.2 HTTP message bodies for API resources

The OpenAPI \[23\] specification of HTTP messages and their content
bodies is contained in annex C.

### 6.2.3 Usage of HTTP headers

#### 6.2.3.1 General

Standard HTTP headers shall be used in accordance with clause 5.2.2 of
TS 29.500 \[21\] for both HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 messages.

#### 6.2.3.2 User Agent identification

##### 6.2.3.2.1 Media Stream Handler identification

The Media Stream Handler in the 5GMS Client shall identify itself to the
5GMS AS at interface M4 using a User-Agent request header (see section
5.5.3 of RFC 7231 \[25\]) that should include the *product* token
5GMS‌Media‌Stream‌Handler. If this product identifier is supplied, the
optional *product-version* suffix shall be present. This should indicate
the version number of the present document (without the leading \"V\")
with which the Media Stream Handler implementation complies and shall,
at minimum, indicate the 3GPP release number with which the
implementation complies.

The Media Stream Handler may additionally supply a *comment* element in
the User-Agent request header containing vendor-specific information.

EXAMPLE 1: 5GMSMediaStreamHandler/17.5.0 (build2634) ExoPlayerLib/2.17.1

EXAMPLE 2: 5GMSMediaStreamHandler/17

##### 6.2.3.2.2 Media Session Handler identification

The Media Session Handler in the 5GMS Client shall identify itself to
the 5GMSd AF at interface M5d using a User-Agent request header (see
section 5.5.3 of RFC 7231 \[25\]) in which the first element shall be a
*product* identified by the token 5GMSMediaSessionHandler. The optional
*product-version* suffix shall be present. This should indicate the
version number of the present document (without the leading \"V\") with
which the Media Session Handler implementation complies and shall, at
minimum, indicate the 3GPP release number with which the implementation
complies.

The Media Session Handler may supply additional vendor-specific product
identifiers in the User-Agent request header and may additionally supply
a *comment* element containing vendor-specific information.

EXAMPLE 1: 5GMSMediaSessionHandler/17.5.0 (build1536)
lib5gmsclient/0.3.1

EXAMPLE 2: 5GMSMediaSessionHandler/17

#### 6.2.3.3 Server identification

##### 6.2.3.3.1 5GMS AF identification

The 5GMS AF shall identify itself at reference points M1 and M5 using a
Server response header (see section 7.4.2 of RFC 7231  \[25\]) that
includes a product string of the following form:

5GMSAF-*{FQDN}*/*{complianceInformation}*

where *{FQDN}* shall be the Fully-Qualified Domain Name of the 5GMSd AF
exposed to the requesting client, and *{complianceInformation}* should
indicate the version number of the present document (without the leading
\"V\") with which the 5GMS AF implementation complies and shall, at
minimum, indicate the 3GPP release number with which the implementation
complies.

The Server response header may also include comments strings and
vendor-specific subproduct strings compliant with the syntax and
guidance provided in section 7.4.2 of \[25\].

EXAMPLE 1: 5GMSAF-vm10664.mno.net/16.9.0 (api=1.1.0) libsbi/2.1
libnf/1.2 libaf/1.1

EXAMPLE 2: 5GMSAF-vm10664.mno.net/16 (api=1.1.0) libsbi/2.1 libnf/1.2
libaf/1.1

#### 6.2.3.4 Support for conditional HTTP GET requests

All responses from the 5GMS AF that carry a resource message body shall
include:

\- a strong entity tag for the resource, conveyed in an ETag response
header,

\- a resource modification timestamp, conveyed in a Last-Modified
response header, and

\- a predicted time-to-live period for the resource, conveyed in a
Cache-Control: max-age response header.

All API endpoints on the 5GMS AF that expose the HTTP GET method shall
support conditional requests using the If-None-Match and
If-Modified-Since request headers. API clients should not attempt to
revalidate their cached copy of a resource using a conditional GET
request before the indicated time-to-live period has elapsed.

#### 6.2.3.5 Support for conditional HTTP POST, PUT, PATCH and DELETE requests

All API endpoints on the 5GMS AF that expose the HTTP POST, PUT, PATCH
or DELETE methods shall support conditional requests using the If-Match
request header. The API client should supply a strong entity tag in an
ETag request header when invoking any of these HTTP methods.

6.3 HTTP response codes
-----------------------

Guidelines for error responses to the invocation of APIs of NF services
are specified in clause 4.8 of TS 29.501 \[22\]. API-specific error
responses are specified in the respective technical specifications.

6.5 Explanation of API data model notation
------------------------------------------

The data models in the following API clauses are specified using the
following notational conventions:

1\. Data models are expressed as an unordered list of JSON properties
\[38\] with one property defined in each row of the data model table.

2\. The *Data type* column defines the type of the property, according
to JSON notation \[38\].

3\. The keyword \"Array\" in the *Data type* column indicates that zero
or more elements of the data type in brackets are included. The number
of elements in the array may additionally be constrained by normative
text in the *Description* column.

4\. The *Cardinality* column defines whether a property is optional or
mandatory. An array with cardinality 0 indicates that the array property
is optional in the data structure. An array with cardinality 1 indicates
that the property is mandatory in the data structure, even when the
array is empty.

5\. The keyword \"Object\" in the *Data type* column indicates a
structured sub-object of an unnamed type whose properties are defined
inline in the indented table rows immediately afterwards. The \"Object\"
type may be combined with the \"Array\" type.

6\. In the case of data types specifying RESTful resources, the
additional *Usage* column defines the property behaviour for each CRUD
Operation as follows:

\- \"C\" (Create), \"R\" (Read) and \"U\" (Update) refers to the CRUD
procedure during which the property is present in the resource type.
(The Delete operation never takes any input data type.)

\- \"RO\" signifies a read-only property. Only the API provider function
is permitted to modify the property value. The API invoker can only read
the value.

\- \"RW\" signifies a read/write property. The API provider and API
invoker may both modify the property value.

7\. An additional read-only property is included at the start of all
data models defining resources that are members of a RESTful collection.
This property is populated with the unique identifier of the resource
within its parent collection, and corresponds to the leaf path element
in the RESTful URL of that resource.

7 Provisioning (M1) APIs
========================

7.1 General
-----------

This clause defines the provisioning API used by a 5GMS Application
Provider to configure downlink or uplink 5G Media Streaming services.

7.2 Provisioning Sessions API
-----------------------------

### 7.2.1 Overview

The Provisioning Sessions API is used by the 5GMS Application Provider
to instantiate and manipulate Provisioning Sessions in the 5GMS System,
as described in clause 4.3.2. Having created a Provisioning Session, the
5GMS Application Provider can then go on to provision other 5GMS
features in the context of that Provisioning Session, using the APIs
specified in clause 7.3 *et seq*. Certain of these features are only
applicable to the type of Provisioning Session created.

### 7.2.2 Resource structure

The Provisioning Sessions API is accessible through the following URL
base path:

*{apiRoot}*/3gpp-m1/v1/provisioning-sessions/

Table 7.4.2‑1 specifies the operations and the corresponding HTTP
methods that are supported by this API. In each case, the sub-resource
path specified in the second column of the table shall be appended to
the above URL base path.

7.3 Server Certificates Provisioning API
----------------------------------------

### 7.3.1 Overview

The Server Certificates Provisioning API is used to provision X.509
\[8\] server certificates that can be referenced by a Content Hosting
Configuration and subsequently presented by the 5GMSd AS when it
distributes content to 5GMSd Clients at interface M4d using Transport
Layer Security \[30\]. Server Certificate resources are provisioned
within the scope of an enclosing Provisioning Session.

### 7.3.2 Resource structure

The Server Certificates Provisioning API is accessible through the
following URL base path:

*{apiRoot}*/3gpp-m1/v1/provisioning-sessions/*{provisioningSessionId}*/

Table 7.3.2‑1 specifies the operations and the corresponding HTTP
methods that are supported by this API. In each case, the Provisioning
Session identifier shall be substituted into *{provisioningSessionId}*
in the above URL template and the sub-resource path specified in the
second column shall be appended to the URL base path.

Provisioning API

### 7.3.3 Data model

#### 7.3.3.1 Certificate Signing Request

The Certificate Signing Request shall comply with the Privacy-Enhanced
Mail (PEM) textual format specified in RFC 7468 \[17\], i.e. a
Base64-encoded DER certificate request or certificate, including leading
and trailing encapsulation boundary lines.

The MIME content type shall be *application/x-pem-file*.

#### 7.3.3.2 Server Certificate resource

The Server Certificate resource shall comply with the Privacy-Enhanced
Mail (PEM) textual format specified in RFC 7468 \[17\], i.e. a
Base64-encoded DER certificate request or certificate, including leading
and trailing encapsulation boundary lines. The resource shall include
only the public parts of the X.509 certificate. In particular, the
private key shall not be included.

The MIME content type shall be *application/x-pem-file*.

### 7.3.4 Operations

Under no circumstances shall the 5GMSd AF reveal the private key
associated with the Certificate Signing Request to the 5GMSd Application
Provider.

7.4 Content Preparation Templates Provisioning API
--------------------------------------------------

### 7.4.1 Overview

Content Preparation Templates are used to specify manipulations applied
by a 5GMS AS to downlink media resources ingested at interface M2d for
distribution at interface M4d, or to uplink media resources contributed
at interface M4u for egest at interface M2u. The Content Preparation
Templates Provisioning API is used to provision a Content Preparation
Template within the scope of a Provisioning Session that can
subsequently be referenced from a Content Hosting Configuration.

### 7.4.2 Resource structure

The Content Preparation Templates Provisioning API is accessible through
the following URL base path:

*{apiRoot}*/3gpp-m1/v1/provisioning-sessions/*{provisioningSessionId}*/

Table 7.4.2‑1 specifies the operations and the corresponding HTTP
methods that are supported by this API. In each case, the Provisioning
Session identifier shall be substituted into *{provisioningSessionId}*
in the above URL template and the sub-resource path specified in the
second column shall be appended to the URL base path.

### 7.6.4 Operations

#### 7.6.4.1 Overview

This clause defines the behaviour that is expected from the 5GMSd AS
when the Content Hosting Configuration has been successfully
provisioned. The main operations that are performed affect the caching
and purging of cached content as well as the processing for media
preparation and at the edge.

#### 7.6.4.2 Content caching

A Content Hosting Configuration may specify caching rules to be applied
to media resources when they are distributed by the 5GMSd AS over
interface M4d. The distribution shall use the *urlPatternFilter* in the
*CachingConfiguration* object to determine which caching directives
apply to that object. In case a media resource\'s URL matches the
pattern filter of more than one *CachingConfiguration,* the first match
shall apply. In case no *CachingConfiguration* is identified as a match,
the 5GMSd AS shall apply the caching directives that were received from
the origin. In the case where no match is found and the origin server
does not supply caching directives at M2d, then default caching
directives based on the media resource type shall be applied.

A caching directive shall either indicate that a matching media resource
is not to be cached by the 5GMSd AS, nor by downstream M4d clients
(*noCache* set to *True*), or that the 5GMSd AS and downstream M4d
clients are to cache it for *maxAge* seconds. The *maxAge* value applies
relative to the time when a media resource was ingested, *t\_ingest*.
For an HTTP-based ingest, this corresponds to the *Date* header field in
the HTTP request/response that carries the media resource at M2d. At the
time *t\_ingest + maxAge*, the object is considered stale and should not
be served at M4d from the 5GMSd AS cache. The 5GMSd AS shall compensate
for any synchronization skew between the origin and its own clock. This
can be for instance done by including the max-stale HTTP cache directive
in its M4d responses.

The *maxAge* value may be signalled at M4d by the 5GMSd AS using the
Expires HTTP response header or the HTTP Cache-Control directives
max‑age or s‑maxage.

When distributing a media resource using HTTP, a *no-cache* request may
be translated into a no-cache and no-store HTTP Cache-Control directive
and/or a max-age=0 HTTP Cache-Control directive.

By default, all origin HTTP header fields shall be assumed as not
forwarded by the 5GMSd AS, unless specified otherwise by setting the
flag *originCacheHeaders* to *True*.

#### 7.6.4.3 Cache purging

The 5GMSd Application Provider may perform a purge operation to
invalidate some or all cached media resources of a particular Content
Hosting Configuration. A regular expression describing the set of media
resource URLs to be purged from the 5GMSd AS cache for the Content
Hosting Configuration in question shall be supplied in the body of the
request. The body shall be encoded using the
*application/x-www-form-urlencoded* MIME content type as a key--value
pair, with the key being the string *pattern* and the value being the
regular expression.

On receiving a purge request, the 5GMSd AF shall immediately invalidate
all media resources in the 5GMSd AS cache matching the regular
expression by declaring them as stale. Any request at reference point
M4d for a purged media resource will trigger the fetching (and possible
caching) of the current version from the origin via M2d in case of a
Pull-based ingest. For Push-based ingest, M4d requests for purged
content shall be responded to with a *404 (Not Found)* HTTP response,
until a new version of the object is pushed by the origin to the
5GMSd AS via M2d.

If the procedure is successful, the 5GMSd AF shall respond with one of
the following response messages:

\- *204 (No Content)* if no cache entries were purged, for example
because no current cache entries matched the regular expression supplied
in the original request.

\- *200 (OK)* if some cache entries were purged. The body of the
response message shall indicate the total number of cache entries purged
in all 5GMSd AS instances distributing the Provisioning Session in
question.

If the procedure is not successful, the 5GMSd AF shall provide a
response code as defined in clause 6.3. In addition, the HTTP response
*422 (Unprocessable Entity)* shall be returned in the case where the
request message body -- or the regular expression contained in it -- are
found by the 5GMSd AF to be syntactically malformed.

#### 7.6.4.4 Content processing

The 5GMSd AS can perform various content processing tasks (such as
repackaging, encryption, ABR transcoding) on media resources ingested at
M2d prior to serving them at M4d. These processing tasks shall be
specified in a Content Preparation Template resource referenced from the
Content Hosting Configuration object.

#### 7.6.4.5 URL signing

The URL signing procedure allows the 5GMSd Application Provider to
prevent deep linking and unauthorized access to M4d media resources. It
works by cryptographically signing some elements of the M4d request URL
and then appending this authentication token to the URL as an additional
query parameter. The token is generated by the 5GMSd Application
Provider and supplied to the player, for example as part of an initial
URL. When it receives a request that requires URL signing, the 5GMSd AS
verifies the presence and validity of the token in the M4d request URL
before allowing access to the requested media resource. The 5GMSd AS(s)
and the origin share a secret that is encoded as part of the query
parameter hash, but not shared with the 5GMSd Media Player.

The validity of the authentication token can also be limited to a single
UE. If *useIPAddress* is set to True, then the public IP address of the
UE as viewed by the 5GMSd AS, *ue\_public\_ip\_address*, shall be
incorporated into the token calculation. The parameter name shall be
indicated by *ipAddressName*.

The shared secret shall be provided in *UrlSignature.passphrase* as a
string of length between 6 and 50 characters. The parameter name for the
passphrase shall be provided by *passphraseName*.

The expiry time of the signed URL, *tokenExpiry*, shall be included as
an additional query parameter in the URL exposed at M4d with the name
indicated in *tokenExpiryName*. The expiry time shall be the string
representation of the number of seconds from 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z UTC
until the specified UTC date/time, ignoring leap seconds, as defined in
section 4.16 of POSIX.1 \[11\].

Given the above, the authentication token shall be calculated as:

*token* :=
SHA512(*url*&*UrlSignature.tokenExpiryName*=*token\_expiry*&*UrlSignature.ipAddressName*=‌*ue\_public\_ip\_address*&‌*UrlSignature.passphraseName*=*passphrase*)

where the SHA512 function shall be the SHA‑512 hash \[6\] of the
enclosed string. The *url* parameter shall be the original M4d media
resource request URL, including the scheme, authority and path
components but excluding any query and fragment components.

The resulting token value shall be \"base64url\" encoded, as specified
in section 5 of RFC 4648 \[10\], prior to inclusion in the M4d URL.

The query part of the signed URL presented by the 5GMSd Media Player at
M4d as proof of authenticity shall be composed as follows:

> *query* :=
> *UrlSignature.tokenExpiryName*=*token\_expiry*&*UrlSignature.tokenName*=base64url(*token*)

For all media resources requested at reference point M4d that match the
regular expression specified in *UrlSignature.urlPattern*, the 5GMSd AS
shall validate the *query* presented in the request URL according to the
following steps:

1\) If the parameter indicated by *UrlSignature.tokenName* is absent
from *query*, or if the supplied *token* value is malformed, the
5GMSd AS shall respond with a *403 (Forbidden)* error response message
and terminate further processing of the M4d request.

2\) If the parameter indicated by *UrlSignature.tokenExpiryName* is
absent from *query*, or if the supplied *token\_expiry* value has
expired, or if the supplied *token\_expiry* is malformed, the 5GMSd AS
shall respond with a *403 (Forbidden)* error response message and
terminate further processing of the M4d request.

3\) The 5GMSd AS shall compute the authentication token according to the
*token* production specified above using the requesting UE\'s public IP
address as the value of *ue\_public\_ip\_address* if required by
*UrlSignature.useIPAddress* being set to *True*. After applying
\"base64url\" encoding, the 5GMSd AS shall compare this with the value
supplied in the URL *query* parameter whose name is
*UrlSignature.tokenName*. If the two values differ, the 5GMSd AS shall
respond with a *403 (Forbidden)* error response message and terminate
further processing of the M4d request.

4\) Otherwise, the presented authentication token is valid. The 5GMSd AS
shall either return the media resource in a *200 (OK)* response message
(if it is able to serve that media resource), or else return an
appropriate error response, such as *404 (Not Found)* or *503 (Service
Unavailable*)*.*

#### 7.6.4.6 Geofencing

The 5GMSd Application Provider may wish to limit access to its media
content at interface M2d to UEs located in certain geographical zones.
Geofencing is used to configure the zone from which content is
accessible.

Two different types of locator are specified here:

**- Administrative area locator:** the value of *GeoFencing.locatorType*
shall be *urn:3gpp:5gms:locator‑type:‌iso3166* and each member of the
*GeoFencing.locators* array shall be either a string representation of
an ISO 3166‑1 alpha‑2 country code \[18\] (e.g. *US*, *CN*, *KR*, *GB*,
*FR*) or an ISO 3166-2 code \[19\] comprising an alpha‑2 country code
and a country subdivision code valid for that country (e.g. *US‑CA*,
*CN-GD*, *KR‑26*, *GB‑ENG*, *GB‑WSM*, *FR‑IDF*, *FR‑75*).

**\[-** **Tracking Area locator:** the value of *GeoFencing.locatorType*
shall be *urn:3gpp:5gms:locatortype:‌trackingAreaCode* and each member
of the *GeoFencing.locators* array shall be the Fully-Qualified Domain
Name representation of a Tracking Area Code, as defined in
clause 19.4.2.3 of TS 23.003 \[7\].\]

7.7 Consumption Reporting Provisioning API

7.9 Policy Templates Provisioning API
-------------------------------------

### 7.9.1 Overview

The Policy Templates Provisioning API allow a 5GMS Application Provider
to configure a set of Policy Templates within the scope of a
Provisioning Session that can subsequently be applied to downlink or
uplink media streaming sessions belonging to that Application Provider
using the Dynamic Policies API specified in clause 11.5. A Policy
Template is used to specify the traffic shaping and charging policies to
be applied to these media streaming sessions.

A Policy Template, identified by its *policyTemplateId*, represents a
set of PCF/NEF API parameters which defines the service quality and
associated charging for the corresponding downlink or uplink media
streaming session(s). The Policy Template is configured as part of the
provisioning procedures with the 5GMS AF and is then used by the 5GMS AF
to request specific QoS and charging policies for that session from the
PCF or NEF.

The state of a Policy Template can be:

\- *pending*: The Policy Template is awaiting validation, potentially
because not all required parameters have yet been provided. This is the
default state after Policy Template creation.

\- *invalid*: One or more of the Policy Template\'s properties failed
validation by the 5GMS AF.

\- *ready*: After successful validation by the 5GMS AF the Policy
Template moves into this state.

\- *suspended*: The 5GMS AF may move a Policy Template into this state
under certain conditions defined within the Service Level Agreement.

When the Policy Template is used for QoS Flows, the *qoSSpecification*
object (of type *M1QoSSpecification*) shall be present:

\- The *qosReference* value is obtained with the Service Level
Agreement. See TS 23.502 for detailed usage.

\- The *maxBtrUl* and *maxBtrDl* properties define the maximal bit rate
which can be used for QoS Flows. This value is defined by the 5G System.

\- The *maxAuthBtrUl* and *MaxAuthBtrDl* properties define the maximal
authorized bit rate values which can be requested by a Media Session
Handler. Higher bit rate values are not authorized for use by the 5GMS
Application Provider.

\- The *minPacketLossRateDl* and *minPacketLossRateUl* properties define
the minimal authorized packet loss rate, which can be requested by a
Media Session Handler.

When the Policy Template is used for differential charging the
*chargingSpecification* property shall be present.

*applicationSessionContext* is a mandatory child object, which contains
at least the *aspId* property.

\- The *aspId* identifies the API invoker.

\- The *dnn* property contains the Data Network Name of the data
network, in which the 5GMS AF is hosted.

\- When Network Slicing is used, the *sliceInfo* property contains
information about the network slice, which is serving the UE.

\- When present, the *afAppId* property contains an application
identifier referencing one or more *PFD* objects. The value of the
*afAppId* property is provided to the PCF with each new
*Npcf\_PolicyAuthorization* service instance.

### 7.9.2 Resource structure

The Policy Template Provisioning API is accessible through the following
URL base path:

*{apiRoot}*/3gpp-m1/v1/provisioning-sessions/*{provisioningSessionId}*/

Table 7.9.2‑1 below specifies the operations and the corresponding HTTP
methods that are supported by this API. In each case, the Provisioning
Session identifier shall be substituted into *{provisioningSessionId}*
in the above URL template and the sub-resource path specified in the
second column shall be appended to the URL base path.

8 Media Ingest and Publish (M2) protocols
=========================================

8.1 General
-----------

The set of content protocols supported by the 5GMS AS is listed in
table 8.1-1 below:

Table 8.1-1: Supported content protocols

  Description                                  Term identifier                                     Clause
  -------------------------------------------- --------------------------------------------------- --------
  Content ingest protocols at interface M2d                                                        
  HTTP pull-based content ingest protocol      *urn:3gpp:5gms:content-protocol:http-pull-ingest*   8.2
  DASH-IF push-based content ingest protocol   *urn:3gpp:5gms:content-protocol:dash-if-ingest*     8.3
  Content egest protocols at interface M2u                                                         
                                                                                                   

8.2 HTTP pull-based content ingest protocol
-------------------------------------------

If *IngestConfiguration.protocol* is set to
*urn:3gpp:5gms:content-protocol:http-pull-ingest* in the Content Hosting
Configuration, media resources shall be ingested by the 5GMSd AS using
HTTP \[9\]. The *IngestConfiguration.pull* property shall be set to
*True*, indicating that a Pull-based protocol is used. The
*IngestConfiguration.baseURL* property shall point at the 5GMSd
Application Provider\'s origin server, as specified in table 7.6.3.1‑1,
and may indicate the use of HTTPS \[16\].

When the 5GMSd AS receives a request for a media resource at interface
M4d that cannot be satisfied from its content cache, the request shall
be transformed into a corresponding HTTP GET request directed to the
5GMSd Application Provider\'s origin server via interface M2d as
follows:

1\. The prefix of the request URL indicated in the
*Distribution‌Configuration.‌baseURL* of the applicable Content Hosting
Configuration is replaced with that of the corresponding
*Ingest‌Configuration‌.baseURL*.

NOTE 1: It is the responsibility of the 5GMSd AF to assign unique M4d
base URLs to each provisioned Content Hosting Configuration so as to
ensure that this substitution is unambiguous.

2\. The path rewrite rules (if provisioned in
*DistributionConfiguration.PathRewriteRules*) are applied in strict
order to the remainder of the request URL (i.e., the path segments
following *Distribution‌Configuration.‌baseURL*). The
*requestPathPattern* of the first matching path rewrite rule is replaced
with the corresponding *mappedPath*.

In the case where the 5GMSd Application Provider\'s origin server issues
an HTTP *3xx* redirect at reference point M2d pointing to another
location, the 5GMSd AS shall issue an equivalent HTTP redirect to the
Media Player via reference point M4d whose location is a dynamically
generated M4d endpoint. Requests to this location shall be rewritten by
the 5GMSd AS to the target location of the M2d redirection.

NOTE 2: This explicit handling of HTTP redirects received by the
5GMSd AS at reference point M2d ensures that it is not bypassed by the
Media Player. The general concept underlying this is commonly referred
to as a \"reverse mapping rule\" by HTTP reverse proxies.

8.3 DASH-IF push-based content ingest protocol
----------------------------------------------

If *IngestConfiguration.protocol* is set to
*urn:3gpp:5gms:content-protocol:dash-if-ingest* in the Content Hosting
Configuration, media resources shall be ingested by the 5GMSd AS as
specified by the DASH‑IF Live Media Ingest specification \[3\]. The
*IngestConfiguration.pull* property shall be set to False, indicating
that a Push-based protocol is used. The *IngestConfiguration.baseURL*
property shall be set by the 5GMSd AF to the base URL that is to be used
by the 5GMSd Application Provider to upload the DASH segments and MPD(s)
to the 5GMSd AS at reference point M2d.

9 Internal (M3) APIs
====================

APIs of this reference point are not specified within this release.

10 Media Streaming (M4) APIs
============================

10.1 General
------------

This clause deals with the interface and APIs for media streaming for
different distribution formats and protocols.

10.2 DASH Distribution
----------------------

In the case of DASH distribution, M4d is relevant for the distribution
as shown in Figure 10.2-1.

Figure 10.2-1: M4d usage for DASH distribution

For DASH-based distribution according to TS 26.247 \[4\] and ISO/IEC
23009-1 \[32\], two main formats are of relevance:

1\) The Media Presentation Description (MPD) that is processed in the
DASH Access Client.

2\) The Segment formats that are passed through the DASH Access Client
and processed in the Media Playback and Content Decryption Platform.
Note that the DASH Access Client may parse Segments to extract for
example Inband Events or producer reference times.

Other resources may be referenced in the MPD, for example DRM related
information.

The Segment formats for DASH Streaming in the context of 5G Media
Streaming are defined in TS 26.511 \[35\] based on the CMAF
encapsulation. The DASH Access Client downloads the Segments from the
5GMSd AS based on the instructions in the MPD and the instructions from
the 5GMSd-Aware Application through M7d (see clause 13 for details).

The interface between the DASH Access Client and the Media Playback and
Content Decryption Platform as well as the 5GMSd Client requirements for
media codecs are documented in TS 26.511 \[35\].

The following requirements apply for M4d:

1\) The Media Presentation Description (MPD) and Segments shall conform
to an MPD according to ISO/IEC 23009-1 \[32\] or TS 26.247 \[4\].

2\) The Segment formats should conform to CMAF addressable resources as
well as to the requirements in TS 26.511 \[35\].

3\) The Media Presentation should conform to the 5G Media Streaming DASH
Interoperability Point as defined in clause 7.3.11 of TS 26.247 \[4\].

A 5GMSd Client shall support the 5G Media Streaming DASH
Interoperability Point as defined in TS 26.247 \[4\], clause 7.3.11. A
5GMSd Client may support additional DASH profiles and interoperability
points.

The MPD may contain a one or several **ServiceDescription** elements
that include operational parameters. The MPD may also include multiple
configurations for the media (different codecs, different content
protection, different resolutions, etc.), for example for playback under
different operating policies. The handling of this information is
documented in clause 13.2.

11 Media Session Handling (M5) APIs
===================================

11.1 General
------------

This clause defines the Media Session Handling APIs used by the Media
Session Handler to access resources exposed by the 5GMS AF at interface
M5.

NOTE: While the entirety of the Media Session Handling APIs apply to
downlink media streaming, only a subset is applicable to uplink media
streaming. Specifically, the Consumption Reporting API is not applicable
to uplink media streaming.

11.2 Service Access Information API
-----------------------------------

### 11.2.1 General

The Service Access Information API is used by the Media Session Handler
to obtain configuration information from the 5GMS AF that enables it to
use the other Media Session Handling APIs specified in clause 11.3 *et
seq.*

### 11.2.2 Resource structure

The Service Access Information API is accessible through the following
URL base path:

*{apiRoot}*/3gpp-m5/v1/service-access-information/

The operations and the corresponding HTTP methods in Table 11.2.2-1 are
supported. In each case, the sub-resource path specified in the second
column shall be appended to the URL base path.

### 11.2.4 Operations

This clause defines the behaviour that is expected from the 5GMS AF when
a Service Access Information resource is acquired by the Media Session
Handler. The main operation that is performed is to look up or generate
the Service Access Information corresponding to the requested
Provisioning Session.

11.3 Consumption Reporting API
------------------------------

### 11.3.1 General

The Consumption Reporting API allows the Media Session Handler to report
downlink media consumption to the 5GMSd AF. The API defines data models,
resources and the related procedures for the creation and management of
the consumption reporting procedures. This procedure is configured by
the *ServiceAccessInformation* resource, as defined in clause 11.2.3.

### 11.3.2 Reporting procedure

Consumption reports shall be submitted to a 5GMSd AF endpoint according
to the following general URL format:

*{apiRoot}*/3gpp-m5*/{apiVersion}/*consumption-reporting/*{provisioningSessionId}*

where the first three elements shall be substituted by the 5GMSd Client
with one of the base URLs selected from the
*client‌Consumption‌Reporting‌Configuration.‌serverAddresses* array of
the *ServiceAccessInformation* resource (see clause 11.2.3.1) and
*{provisioningSessionId}* shall be substituted with the relevant
Provisioning Session identifier obtained from Service Access Information
(see clause 11.2.3).

The only HTTP method supported by this endpoint is POST.

### 11.3.3 Report format

#### 11.3.3.1 ConsumptionReport format

This type represents the format of consumption report instance. This
structure is used by the Media Session Handler to report the
consumption.

11.4 Metrics Reporting API
--------------------------

### 11.4.1 General

The Metrics Reporting API allows the Media Session Handler to send QoE
metrics reports to the 5GMS AF. This procedure is configured by the
*ServiceAccessInformation* resource, as defined in clause 11.2.3. Note
that multiple metrics configurations can be active at the same time,
each identified by a unique *metricsReportingConfigurationId*.

### 11.4.2 Reporting procedure

Metrics reports related to a specific *metricsReportingConfigurationId*
shall be submitted according to the following general format:

{apiRoot}/3gpp-m5*/*{apiVersion}*/*metrics-reporting/‌{provisioningSessionId}/‌{metricsReporting‌ConfigurationId}

where the first three elements shall be substituted by the 5GMS Client
with one of the base URLs selected from the
*client‌Metrics‌Reporting‌Configurations.serverAddresses* array of the
*ServiceAccessInformation* resource (see clause 11.2.3.1),
*{provisioning‌Session‌Id}* shall be substituted with the relevant
Provisioning Session identifier obtained from Service Access Information
(see clause 11.2.3) and *{metricsReportingConfigurationId}* shall be
substituted with the relevant Metrics Reporting Configuration
identifier.

The only HTTP method supported by this endpoint is POST.

### 11.4.3 Report format

Metrics reports shall be submitted by the Media Session Handler in a
format specified by the metrics reporting scheme in question. The
Content-Type HTTP request header shall be set in accordance with the
relevant metrics reporting scheme specification.

NOTE: For downlink media streaming, TS 26.247 \[7\] clauses 10.6.1 and
10.6.2 specify the required MIME content type and metrics report format
for the 3GPP *urn:‌3GPP:‌ns:‌PSS:‌DASH:‌QM10* metrics reporting scheme.
For virtual reality media the report format is further extended as
defined in TS 26.118 \[42\] clause 9.4.

In XML documents representing metrics reports for 3GP-DASH downlink
media streaming services, the **ReceptionReport**\@clientID attribute,
if present and is available to the Media Session Handler, should be a
GPSI value as defined by TS 23.003 \[7\]. Otherwise, this attribute
should be represented by a stable and globally unique string.

11.5 Dynamic Policies API
-------------------------

### 11.5.1 Overview

The Dynamic Policies API allows the Media Session Handler to request a
specific policy and charging treatment to be applied to a particular
application data flow of a downlink or uplink media streaming session by
invoking RESTful operations on the 5GMS AF at interface M5. The API
defines a set of data models, resources and the related procedures for
the creation and management of the dynamic policy request.

Application Identifiers, referring to one or more Packet Flow
Description (PFD), may be used as alternative traffic filtering
parameters for dynamic policy invocation. The 5GMSd AF shall first
provision a PFD in the PFDF for one or more (external) Application IDs
by sending an HTTP POST message to the NEF as specified in clause 4.4.10
of TS 29.122 \[12\]. The mapping between the (external) Application
Identifiers and PFDs stored in the PFDF will then be pushed to or pulled
from the SMF and installed in the UPF for future traffic
identifications.

NOTE: The PFDF is a functionality within the NEF.

### 11.5.2 Resource structure

The Dynamic Policies API is accessible through the following URL base
path:

*{apiRoot}*/3gpp-m5*/*v1*/*dynamic-policies/

where the first three elements shall be substituted by the 5GMS Client
with one of the URLs selected from the
*dynamicPolicy‌Invocation‌Configuration.serverAddresses* array of the
*ServiceAccessInformation* resource (see clause 11.2.3.1).

Table 11.5.2‑1 below specifies the operations and the corresponding HTTP
methods that are supported by this API. The sub-resource path specified
in the second column shall be appended to the URL base path.

### 11.5.4 Operations

This clause defines the behaviour that is expected when activating a
Dynamic Policy Instance.

The *policyTemplateId* property uniquely identifies the Policy Template
with which the Dynamic Policy Instance is associated.

The *provisioningSessionId* property associates the Dynamic Policy
Instance with a Provisioning Session.

The Dynamic Policy resource contains a *serviceDataFlowDescriptions*
property which contains a set of service data flow templates according
to TS 23.503 \[33\]. Each service data flow template contains one of:

\- a *flowDescription* object (including 5-tuples, Type of Service,
Security Parameter Index, etc.).

\- a *domainName.*

When the Media Session Handler is attempting to activate a QoS-related
Dynamic Policy Template, then the *qosSpecification* property shall be
present and it shall contain the following properties:

\- *marBwDlBitRate* or *marBwUlBitRate*, indicating the maximum
requested bit rate by the Media Session Handler.

\- *mirBwDlBitRate* or *mirBwUlBitRate*, indicating the minimum
requested bit rate by the Media Session Handler.

\- *minDesBwDlBitRate* or *minDesBwUlBitrate*, indicating the minimum
bit rate desired by the Media Session Handler.

When the 5G System employs a traffic enforcement function to ensure that
the traffic is complying a certain traffic policy, the Dynamic Policy
resource may contain the following two properties:

\- an *enforcementMethod*, indicating the type of enforcement method
(like leaky bucket).

\- an *enforcementBitrate* property, indicating the maximal permitted
bit rate.

11.6 Network Assistance API
---------------------------

### 11.6.1 Overview

If AF-based Network Assistance is supported, then the Network Assistance
API component of interface M5, as defined in the present sub-clause, is
first used to provision a Network Assistance Session resource. The
Network Assistance Resource can then be used to obtain bit rate
recommendations and to issue delivery boost requests during the ongoing
media streaming session.

### 11.6.2 Resource structure

The Network Assistance API is accessible via the following URL base
path:

*{apiRoot}*/3gpp‑m5*/*v1*/*network-assistance/

where the first three elements shall be substituted by the 5GMS Client
with one of the URLs selected from the
*network‌Assistance‌Configuration.serverAddresses* array of the
*ServiceAccessInformation* resource (see clause 11.2.3.1).

Table 11.6.2‑1 below specifies the operations and the corresponding HTTP
methods that are supported by this API. In each case, the sub-resource
path specified in the second column of the table shall be appended to
the URL base path.

Table 11.6.2-1: Operations supported by the Network Assistance API

### 11.6.4 Operations

#### 11.6.4.1 Create Network Assistance session

This clause defines the behaviour that is expected when creating a
Network Assistance session.

The Media Session Handler uses the POST HTTP method to create a Network
Assistance session with the 5GMS AF. The request includes a
*NetworkAssistanceSession* resource representation in the message body.

The *provisioningSessionId* property associates the Network Assistance
session with a Provisioning Session.

The Media Session Handler populates the *NetworkAssistanceSession*
resource representation in the request with service data flow
information and optionally the Policy Template identifier of the network
QoS policy currently in force on the media streaming session for which
Network Assistance operations are to be performed. (The 5GMS AF
subsequently uses this information to execute Network Assistance
operations in the 5GC.)

The *serviceDataFlowDescriptions* property contains a set of service
data flow templates according to TS 23.503 \[33\]. Each service data
flow template contains one of:

\- a *flowDescription* object (including 5-tuples, Type of Service,
Security Parameter Index, etc.).

\- a *domainName.*

The *requestedQoS* property is used by the Media Session Handler to
specify a network QoS it initially wishes to use for the media streaming
session. If the *policyTemplateId* property is also populated in the
*NetworkAssistanceSession* resource, the 5GMS AF shall return a *400 Bad
Request* HTTP response message if the requested network QoS lies outside
the limits specified in the referenced Policy Template.

If the *requestedQoS* property is omitted from the
*NetworkAssistanceSession* resource but the *policyTemplateId* is
populated, the 5GMS AF shall use the network QoS currently provisioned
in the referenced Policy Template as the floor/ceiling for bit rate
recommendations and delivery boosts within the scope of the Network
Assistance session.

If neither a *policyTemplateId* nor a *requestedQoS* are supplied when
creating a Network Assistance session, operations invoked on the 5GMS AF
within the scope of the Network Assistance session are constrained only
by the policies of the PCF.

The 5GMS AF returns the Network Assistance session identifier if session
setup was successful, otherwise an error code is returned without a
Network Assistance session identifier.

The 5GMS Client uses the Network Assistance session resource identifier
(*naSessionId*) provided by the 5GMS AF to refer all subsequent API
calls to the 5GMS AF applicable to that Network Assistance session.

#### 11.6.4.2 Retrieve Network Assistance session

The 5GMS Client uses the GET HTTP method with the Network Assistance
Session resource identifier to retrieve a Network Assistance Session
resource from the 5GMS AF. The 5GMS AF returns the Network Assistance
Session resource if retrieval was successful, otherwise an appropriate
error code is returned without the session resource in case of failure.

#### 11.6.4.3 Request bit rate recommendation

The Media Session Handler uses the GET HTTP method with the sub-resource
path specified in table 11.6.2‑1 to request a bit rate recommendation
from the 5GMS AF. The 5GMS AF shall return the recommended bit rate in
an HTTP response body of type *M5QoSSpecification* if a bit rate
recommendation could be obtained, otherwise an appropriate HTTP error
code shall be returned with no response body.

\- For a downlink media streaming session, the recommended minimum and
maximum downlink bit rates shall be indicated in the properties
*mirBwDlBitRate* and *marBwDlBitRate* respectively. The 5GMSd Client
shall ignore the mandatory properties related to uplink streaming, i.e.
*mirBwUlBitRate* and *marBwUlBitRate*.

\- For an uplink media streaming session, the recommended minimum and
maximum uplink bit rates shall be indicated in the properties
*mirBwUlBitRate* and *marBwUlBitRate*, respectively. The 5GMSu Client
shall ignore the mandatory properties related to downlink streaming,
i.e. *mirBwDlBitRate* and *marBwDlBitRate*.

If a unique recommendation is given by the 5GMS AF then this recommended
bit rate shall be set in both of these properties. The optional
properties *minDesBwDlBitRate*, *minDesBwUlBitRate*, *desLatency* and
*desLoss* shall not be included in the response.

#### 11.6.4.4 Request delivery boost

The Media Session Handler uses the POST HTTP method with the
sub-resource path specified in table 11.6.2‑1 to request a delivery
boost from the 5GMS AF. The 5GMS AF shall respond with the
*OperationSuccessResponse* data type indicating whether or not the
delivery boost will be attempted by the network within an upcoming
nominal time period.

#### 11.6.4.5 Update Network Assistance session

The Media Session Handler uses the PUT or PATCH HTTP methods to replace
the existing steaming session parameters with new settings. For example,
any change to the Policy Template currently in force resulting from an
invocation of the Dynamic Policies API (see clause 11.5) should also be
notified to the 5GMS AF using this operation if a Network Assistance
session has been created for the media streaming session in question.

The 5GMS AF returns the *NetworkAssistanceSession* resource with
settings resulting from the PUT or PATCH update operation.

#### 11.6.4.6 Destroy Network Assistance session

The Media Session Handler uses the DELETE HTTP method to terminate the
indicated Network Assistance session. The 5GMS AF returns an appropriate
response code. If the termination was successful, then any subsequent
calls referring to the terminated session will result in the error *404
(Not Found)*.

12 UE Media Session Handling (M6) APIs for uplink and downlink
==============================================================

12.1 General
------------

This clause defines the client APIs for Media Session Handling to be
used by other 5G System components such as a Media Player in a 5GMSd
client or the Media Streamer in a 5GMSu client.

12.2 Media Session Handling for Downlink media streaming -- APIs and Functions
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 12.2.1 Overview

In the following, it is assumed that the Media Session Handler for
downlink media streaming adheres to a basic set of functionalities as
shown in Figure 12.2.1-1.

Figure 12.2.1-1: Usage of M6d in Media Downlink Streaming

The Media Session Handler is considered to run as a service in the
background, and is invoked for a media session once a media player in
the 5GMSd streaming client is activated with an MPD URL of media MIME
type \"application/dash+xml\". Based on the MPD URL, the Media Session
Handler may initiate communication with the 5GMSd AF through M5d.

NOTE: The initiation of the Media Session Handler for other media types
than DASH is for further study.

For an ongoing 5G Media Streaming session, the Media Session Handler is
given the following authorizations:

> 1\) The ability to do status query on M7d. For details see clause 13.
>
> 2\) The ability to process notifications and error on M7d. For details
> see clause 13.
>
> 3\) The ability to configure certain parameters on the media player
> based on M7d. For details again see clause 13.

In addition, the MSH can provide information on M6d to the application
and possibly delegated to Media Player using M6d for each of the Media
Session Handler functionalities, namely providing:

> 1\) Notification and Error Events;
>
> 2\) Status Information.

### 12.2.2 Media Session Handler model

#### 12.2.2.1 State model

An informative state model for the Media Session Handler is for further
study.

  *\_status\[\]*          The Media Session Handler maintains a status record.                              

#### 12.2.2.3 Media Session Handler internal operations

This aspect is for further study.

#### 12.2.2.4 Starting and Stopping a Media Session Handler

There are different ways to start a Media Session Handler. The most
typical one is that the start is bound to the call of a Media Player
with an MPD URL. That start method offers a client--server like
interface realized by M6d. The service is bound such that the Media
Session Handler communicates back to the Media Player.

12.3 Media Session Handling for Uplink Streaming -- APIs and Functions
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Details are for further study.

13 UE Media Stream Handler (M7) APIs for uplink and downlink
============================================================

13.1 General
------------

This clause defines a set of APIs and methods that permit an application
or other UE functions to communicate with a Media Player or Media
Streamer. The main focus of this clause is to formalize and harmonize
commonly available proprietary APIs in order to support the usage of a
Media Player or a Media Streamer in a 5G Media Streaming context.

The APIs specified in this clause are language- and runtime-independent.
Implementations are expected to provide language bindings appropriate to
the UE runtime environment.

13.2 DASH Media Player -- APIs and Functions
--------------------------------------------

### 13.2.1 Overview

In the following, it is assumed that the Media Player (in this case a
DASH client) adheres to a basic set of functionalities as shown in
Figure 13.2-1. The DASH client downloads, processes and presents a DASH
Media Presentation by instruction of a 5GMSd-Aware Application using the
M7d interface.

The 5GMSd-Aware Application can, in addition, configure the presentation
of the media, can receive notifications on events, or can query the
internal status of the DASH Player, also supported through M7d.
Different functions of the DASH Access Client that are typically
necessary to process a DASH Media Presentation, are shown in
Figure 13.2-1. Additional functions may be available as well.

Figure 13.2.1-1: DASH Client Architecture

The key functionalities of each of the functions as shown in
Figure 13.2-1 are summarized in the following:

> \- *5GMSd-Aware Application:* Application that makes use of the
> DASH/Media Player to playback a DASH Media Presentation using the APIs
> defined in this clause.
>
> \- *Media Player:* A complete player for the playback of a Media
> Presentation, including the Media Playback and Content Decryption
> Platform as defined in TS 26.511 \[35\].
>
> \- *Access Client:* A part of the DASH Player that accesses and
> downloads of the resources and provides the downloaded resources to
> the Media Playback Platform and Content Decryption for the playback of
> DASH content.
>
> \- *Management:* Controls all internal processes and the communication
> with the 5GMSd-aware application. In particular this includes the
> handling of service descriptions and operation points.
>
> \- *MPD Processing:* parses and processes the MPD and extracts the
> relevant information.
>
> \- *Adaptation Set Selection:* selects the Adaptation Set based on
> user, application and/or device capability information. Information
> provided through M7d may be used.
>
> \- *ABR Controller and Dynamic Switching:* runs adaptive bit rate
> logic and triggers adaptive switching of Representations. Information
> provided to the DASH client through M7d may be used.
>
> \- *Throughput Estimation:* estimates the throughput from the 5GMSd
> Application Server.
>
> \- *Metrics Logging:* logs relevant low-level metrics and provides
> those to the metrics aggregation and reporting functions in the Media
> Session Handler.
>
> \- *Media Playback Management and Protection Controller:* manages the
> media playback by moving downloaded information into media playback
> platform and also addresses handling of protection and DRM related
> information.
>
> \- *Media Playback and Content Decryption Platform:* plays back
> CMAF-based media content according to the playback requirements in
> TS 26.511 \[35\]. It also provides status information as well as
> events that maybe be provided through M7d.
>
> \- *Event Processing:* Processes DASH events and provides information
> to application as defined in TS 26.247 \[4\].

This clause focuses on Media Player related communication through M7d.
In particular, the following aspects of M7d are defined:

> 1\) Methods to interact with the Media Player are defined in
> clause 13.2.3.
>
> 2\) Notification and Error Events are defined in clause 13.2.4.
>
> 3\) Configuration and Settings APIs are defined in clause 13.2.5.
>
> 4\) Status Information API is defined in clause 13.2.6.

The communication to the media playback platform is defined through the
details in TS 26.511 \[35\].

A 5GMSd client for DASH distribution shall support the APIs defined in
this clause 13.

NOTE: The initial APIs have largely been designed based on the dash.js
APIs documented here: <http://cdn.dashjs.org/latest/jsdoc>.

### 13.2.2 Media Player model

Figure 13.2.2-1 provides an informative client state model in order to
appropriately describe the messages on the Media streaming service API.
Six different states are defined.

State changes may happen based on:

\- Calls from application.

\- Information provided in the Media Presentation Description (MPD).

![](media/image7.png){width="6.489583333333333in"
height="4.159419291338582in"}

Figure 13.2.2-1: State Diagram for Media Player

Table 13.2.2-1 defines states for the Media Player. Detailed
descriptions are provided in the following subclauses.

Table 13.2.2-1: States of Media Player

  States          Definition
  --------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  *IDLE*          The Media Player is not associated with any application.
  *INITIALIZED*   The Media Player is associated with an application and the M7d API communication is established.
  *READY*         The Media Player has loaded an MPD and is able to playback the media in this Media Presentation. It also updates the MPD according to the MPD update mechanism.
  *PRELOADED*     The Media Player has pre-loaded all media information in order to start playback instantaneously. It also updates the MPD according to the MPD update mechanism.
  *PLAYING*       The Media Player is playing the Media Presentation. It also updates the MPD according to the MPD update mechanism.
  *PAUSED*        The playback of the Media Presentation is paused. It also updates the MPD according to the MPD update mechanism.

It is assumed that the DASH Access Client manages the playback of at
most one CMAF track for each media type, namely one for video, one for
audio and one for subtitles as defined in TS 26.511 \[35\]. Playback of
multiple CMAF tracks of the same media type is not excluded for 5GMS,
but details is for further study.

### 13.2.3 Methods

#### 13.2.3.1 General

Based on the state model in clause 13.2.2, this clause introduces
relevant procedures and API calls.

Table 13.2.3.1-1 provides an overview over the methods defined for the
DASH-based streaming API. Note that in implementations, additional
methods may be supported.

+------------+------------------+------------------------------------+

The following Media Player Actions are expected:

\- The *Request Scheduling* and *Download* functions are established.

\- If the input is a URL, the Media Player requests the MPD at the
corresponding URL through M4d.

\- If the MPD is not found after multiple retries, an error
*ERROR\_MPD\_NOT\_FOUND* is returned and the process is terminated.

\- The *MPD Processing* function is established and the MPD parsed.

\- If the MPD is not valid, an error *ERROR\_MPD\_NOT\_VALID* is
returned and the process is terminated.

\- If the DASH Player does not support the profiles as indicated in the
MPD, an error *ERROR\_PROFILE\_NOT\_SUPPORTED* is returned and the
process is terminated.

\- Depending on the type of the MPD, possibly present anchors as well as
the wall-clock time, the Media Player selects the Period in the content
that is expected to be played next.

\- The *Media Playback Management and Protection Controller* is
established.

\- The MPD is parsed for available Service Descriptions (including Media
Subsets and Adaptation Sets). By using capability mechanisms defined in
TS 26.511 \[35\] as well as using other information (language settings,
output capabilities, accessibility settings), the Media Player
identifies a set of permissible Service Descriptions including Media
Subsets and Adaptation Sets. If no Adaptation Sets are capable to be
played, an error *ERROR\_MEDIA\_NOT\_SUPPORTED* is returned and the
process is terminated.

\- The available Service Descriptions including included Adaptation Sets
are provided to the application through M7d.

\- The application may select a Service Description instance as well as
Adaptation Sets. Additional Service Descriptions parameters may be
configured through M7d.

\- Based on the service description parameters and selected Adaptation
Sets:

\- the Operation Point parameters are set.

\- the *Media Playback Platform and Content Decryption* is established
using the methods defined in TS 26.511.

\- The selected Adaptation Sets are initialized by downloading the
relevant Initialization Segments/CMAF Headers through M4d in the Media
Playback Platform as in TS 26.511 \[35\] establishing a track buffer for
each selected media type.

\- Depending on the MPD information and/or M7d configuration, one or
more of the following functions may be established:

\- Metrics Logging and Collection

\- Event Processing and Notification

\- Client Metadata handling

\- The Media Player is left in the *READY* state.

### 13.2.7 Usage of M7d Information by Media Session Handler

The media session handler may use the notifications, errors and status
information provided through M7d to execute relevant tasks.

14 Application (M8) APIs for uplink and downlink
================================================

APIs of this reference point are not specified within this release.

15 Miscellaneous UE-internal APIs
=================================

15.1 General
------------

While the core functionality of 5GMS is specified in terms of the
dedicated system interfaces and APIs that impact the UE, specified in
clauses 10 to 14 (M4 to M8 respectively), certain features of 5GMS rely
on interfaces and APIs that are essentially UE-internal.

Each usage of a UE-internal interface is specified in subsequent
sub-clauses of the present clause.

15.2 RAN Signaling-based Network Assistance API
-----------------------------------------------

If RAN Signaling-based Network Assistance is supported, the Media
Session Handler uses an interface to the RAN Modem (specifically, the UE
MAC entity in the modem) to send and receive bit rate recommendation
messages. The interface to the modem may be based on the AT commands
*+CGBRRREQ* and *+CGBRRREP* as defined in \[15\].

Furthermore, messaging across that interface corresponds to the logical
translations of the *Bit Rate Recommendation* and/or *Bit Rate
Recommendation Query* messages, carried by the Recommended bit rate MAC
CE, exchanged between the RAN Modem and the RAN, as specified in \[13\]
for 5G NR and \[14\] for LTE. The association between the LCID for which
the recommendation applies and the actual flow (including the
intermediate RLC channel) is performed by the modem.

NOTE: The *+C5GQOSRDP=?* command may be used to get a list of CID values
that are associated with QoS flows (both network and MT/TE
initiated).When used for requesting a bit rate boost, the query shall
not request a bit rate that may exceed the MFBR for the corresponding
QoS Flow. Failure to ensure this may result in unexpected
congestion-induced packet delays and dropping.

The *Bit Rate Recommendation Query* shall indicate the bit rate desired
by the application, as described by \[13\] and \[14\]. This request may
be used by the 5GMSd Media Session Handler to request for a temporary
increase in bit rate for the corresponding flow (bit rate boost). The
RAN responds with a Bit Rate Recommendation message that confirms the
recommended bit rate after the boost grant. Once the bit rate drops
again after a boost grant, the network shall inform the Media Session
Handler about the new recommended bit rate by means of an ANBR message.

Whenever the Media Session Handler receives a message from the RAN
Modem, corresponding to the logical translation of the *Bit Rate
Recommendation* message for the associated RAN uplink or downlink, it
shall indicate the associated bit rate recommendation to either the
Media Player (via M7d, in the case of downlink streaming) or Media
Streamer (via M7u, in the case of uplink streaming) function of an
affiliated PDU session. Furthermore, whenever the Media Session Handler
receives a request for a bit rate boost from either the Media Player
(via M6d in the case of downlink streaming) or the Media Streamer (via
M6u, in the case of uplink streaming) function of an affiliated PDU
session, it may send a bit rate boost message to the RAN Modem. That bit
rate boost request is logically translated by the modem to the *Bit Rate
Recommendation Query* message which is then sent to the RAN on the
associated RAN uplink or downlink.

It is left to the implementer of the media player to decide how to best
use the bit rate recommendation and the bit rate recommendation query
information for the media streaming sessions.

15.3 RAN-based Metrics Reporting API
------------------------------------

These procedures shall be used by the Media Session Handler to control
metrics reporting when such reporting is configured by the OAM via the
5G control channel.

The Media Session Handler shall subscribe to metrics configurations from
the OAM according to TS 26.247 Annex L.1. This configuration may also
include virtual reality metrics as specified in TS 26.118 \[42\] clause
9.3. When a metrics configuration is received, the Media Session Handler
shall store this configuration and use it for all subsequent streaming
sessions.

When a streaming session is started the Media Session Handler shall
determine whether metrics from this session shall be reported. The
determination shall be based on the *sample percentage* and *streaming
source filter* specified in the stored metrics configuration, according
to TS 26.247 Annex F.

If metrics are to be reported for the session, the Media Session Handler
shall request the Media Player to create a metrics collection job. The
Media Player shall return a reference to the created job, which the
Media Session Handler shall use in all subsequent actions related to
this job.

The Media Session Handler shall configure the metrics collection job
with the set of metrics that shall be collected during the session. The
format of the configuration shall be according to TS 26.247 Annex L.2,
but note that only the *metrics* attribute in the configuration shall be
used for this purpose.

The Media Session Handler shall regularly request the collected metrics
from the Media Player according to the *reportingInterval* specified in
the metrics configuration. The metrics returned by the Media Player
shall use the format as described in TS 26.247 clause 10.6, and (for
virtual reality media) in TS 26.118 \[42\] clause 9.4, and the Media
Session Handler shall forward these to the OAM according to TS 26.247
Annex L.1.

When the session is finished the Media Session Handler shall delete the
metrics collection job.

16 Usage of 5GC interfaces and APIs
===================================

16.1 General
------------

While the core functionality of 5GMS is specified in terms of the
dedicated system interfaces and APIs specified in clauses 7 to 14 (for
M1 to M8 respectively), certain features of 5GMS rely on interfaces and
APIs defined within the scope of the 5GC.

Each such case of usage of a 5GC interface and API is documented in
subsequent sub-clauses of the present clause.

NOTE: The 5GMS architecture may be applied to an EPS although such an
application is not specified in the present document and is left to the
discretion of deployments and implementations.

16.2 Usage of N5/N33 for AF-based Network Assistance
----------------------------------------------------

The AF-based Network Assistance feature operates at reference point M5
between the Media Session Handler in the 5GMS Client and a 5GMS AF that
provides Network Assistance capabilities. The Network Assistance API at
reference point M5 (see clause 11.6) is specified in a generic way such
that the associated Network Assistance functionality in the 5GC may be
realised by various means.

NOTE 1: This clause does not limit the possible set of 5G System
exposure functionalities for obtaining Network Assistance information.

In this release, the 5GMS AF converts Network Assistance API invocations
received at reference point M5 into direct or indirect invocations of
the Policy Authorization Service exposed by the PCF, and converts
responses and notifications from the PCF into their equivalents at
reference point M5 for delivery to the Media Session Handler.

If it supports the Network Assistance feature, the 5GMS AF shall offer
the bit rate recommendation (throughput estimation) and delivery boost
request API based on existing Policy Templates that match the filtering
criteria for a media streaming session, and the 5GMS AF shall interact
with the PCF using one of the following methods:

A. If the 5GMS AF is deployed in the Trusted DN, it may directly invoke
the *Npcf\_Policy‌Authorization* service at reference point N5, as
specified in TS 29.514 \[34\].

NOTE 2: It is the responsibility of the 5GMS AF in this case to discover
and track changes to the PCF instance responsible for the PDU Session
supporting the media streaming session at reference point M4 using the
discovery services provided by the NRF and/or BSF.

B. If the 5GMS AF is deployed outside the Trusted DN, or if it is more
convenient for a 5GMS AF deployed in the Trusted DN to do so, it invokes
the *Nnef\_AFSessionWithQoS* service exposed by the NEF, as specified in
clause 4.4.9 of TS 29.522 \[50\], to indirectly invoke the PCF at
reference point N33.

NOTE 3: Per clause 4.4.9 of TS 29.522 \[50\], the
*Nnef\_AFSession‌With‌QoS* service is realised at reference point N33 by
the *AsSession‌With‌QoS* exposure API.

NOTE 4: Configuration of the NEF endpoint address and access credentials
in the 5GMS AF in this case is beyond the scope of the present document.

When a Network Assistance session is created by the Media Session
Handler (per clauses 4.7.6 and 11.6.4.1), the 5GMS AF shall create an
*AF application session context* in the PCF responsible for the PDU
Session corresponding to the M4 application flows listed in the
*NetworkAssistanceSession.‌serviceDataFlow‌Descriptions* property.

If no corresponding AF application session context already exists, the
5GMS AF shall use the *Npcf\_‌Policy‌Authorization\_‌Create* operation
at reference point N5 (or, if deployed outside the Trusted DN, the
equivalent *AsSession‌WithQoS* service operation) with the appropriate
service information to create and provision a new AF application session
context. The information in the *AppSessionContext‌ReqData* shall be
derived from the service data flow descriptions in the Network
Assistance session resource, as well as from the referenced Policy
Template (if any) and/or the requested QoS.

The AF application session context shall declare exactly one media
component per media streaming session. A separate sub-component shall be
declared for each M4 application flow listed in the
*NetworkAssistanceSession.‌serviceDataFlow‌Descriptions* array.

For each of the Network Assistance sessions it is managing, the 5GMS AF
shall subscribe to the following PCF notifications on the corresponding
AF application session context:

\- Service Data Flow QoS notification control;

\- Service Data Flow deactivation;

\- Resources allocation outcome.

When requesting QoS provisioning for a media streaming session, the
5GMS AF shall use the configured Policy Templates of the Provisioning
Session to determine the list of the QoS references within the
\"altSerReqs\". The lowest priority index shall be assigned to the
policy template with the lowest QoS requirement, and the highest
priority shall be assigned to the requested operation point by the UE
(if the UE is allowed to use that operation point).

When a Network Assistance session is subsequently destroyed by the Media
Session Handler (per clauses 4.7.6 and 11.6.4.6), the 5GMS AF shall
destroy the corresponding AF application session context in the relevant
PCF instance.

16.3 Usage of N5/N33 for dynamic policies
-----------------------------------------

The dynamic policies feature operates at reference point M5 between the
Media Session Handler in the 5GMS Client and a 5GMS AF that has been
appropriately provisioned with Policy Templates. The Dynamic Policies
API at reference point M5 (see clause 11.5) is specified in a generic
way such that the associated functionality in the 5GC may be realised by
various means.

NOTE 1: This clause does not limit the possible set of 5G System
exposure functionalities for realising dynamic policies.

In this release, the 5GMS AF converts Dynamic Policies API invocations
received at reference point M5 into direct or indirect invocations of
the Policy Authorization Service exposed by the PCF, and converts
responses from the PCF into their equivalents at reference point M5 for
return to the Media Session Handler.

To realise dynamic policies, the 5GMS AF shall interact with the PCF
using one of the following methods:

A. If the 5GMS AF is deployed in the Trusted DN, it may directly invoke
the *Npcf\_Policy‌Authorization* service at reference point N5, as
specified in TS 29.514 \[34\].

NOTE 2: It is the responsibility of the 5GMS AF in this case to discover
and track changes to the PCF instance responsible for the PDU Session
supporting the media streaming session at reference point M4 using the
discovery services provided by the NRF and/or BSF.

B. If the 5GMS AF is deployed outside the Trusted DN, or if it is more
convenient for a 5GMS AF deployed in the Trusted DN to do so, it invokes
the *Nnef\_AFSession‌With‌QoS* and/or *Nnef\_Chargeable‌Party* services
exposed by the NEF, as specified in clauses 4.4.9 and 4.4.8 respectively
of TS 29.522 \[50\], to indirectly invoke the PCF at reference point
N33.

NOTE 3: Per clause 4.4.9 of TS 29.522 \[50\], the
*Nnef\_AFSession‌With‌QoS* service is realised at reference point N33 by
the *AsSession‌With‌QoS* exposure API. Similarly, the
*Nnef\_Chargeable‌Party* service is realised by the *Chargeable‌Party*
exposure API per clause 4.4.8 of \[50\].

NOTE 4: Configuration of the NEF endpoint address and access credentials
in the 5GMS AF in this case is beyond the scope of the present document.

When a dynamic policy is instantiated by the Media Session Handler (per
clause 4.7.3), the 5GMS AF shall create an *AF application session
context* in the PCF responsible for the PDU Session corresponding to the
M4 application flows listed in the
*DynamicPolicy.‌serviceDataFlow‌Descriptions* property.

If no corresponding AF application session context already exists, the
5GMS AF shall use the *Npcf\_‌Policy‌Authorization\_‌Create* operation
at reference point N5 (or, if deployed outside the Trusted DN, the
equivalent *AsSession‌WithQoS* service operation) with the appropriate
service information to create and provision a new AF application session
context. The information in the *AppSessionContext‌ReqData* shall be
derived from the service data flow descriptions in the dynamic policy
resource and/or the requested QoS.

The AF application session context shall declare exactly one media
component per media streaming session. A separate sub-component shall be
declared for each M4 application flow listed in the
*NetworkAssistanceSession.‌serviceDataFlow‌Descriptions* array.

For each of the dynamic policies it is managing, the 5GMS AF shall
subscribe to the following PCF notifications on the corresponding AF
application session context:

\- Service Data Flow QoS notification control;

\- Service Data Flow deactivation;

\- Resources allocation outcome.

When requesting QoS provisioning for a media streaming session, the
5GMS AF shall use the configured Policy Template of the dynamic policy
to determine the list of the QoS references within the \"altSerReqs\".
The lowest priority index shall be assigned to the policy template with
the lowest QoS requirement, and the highest priority shall be assigned
to the requested operation point by the UE (if the UE is allowed to use
that operation point).

When a dynamic policy is subsequently destroyed by the Media Session
Handler (per clause 4.7.3), the 5GMS AF shall destroy the corresponding
AF application session context in the relevant PCF instance.

######## Annex A (informative): 5GMS Parameter propagation for DASH Streaming

A.1 End-to-end model
====================

Figure A.1‑1 below depicts an end-to-end model for the 5GMS parameter
propagation for DASH streaming with dynamic policy. The arrows indicate
the main information flow. The interfaces specified in TS 26.501 \[2\]
are used throughout. However, there are additional interfaces (i.e. P1
or U1), which are not in the 5GMS Architecture.

![](media/image8.jpg){width="6.75in" height="2.8333333333333335in"}

Figure A.1‑1: End-to-end model for dynamic policy parameter propagation

The interfaces involved and their roles in this feature are as follows:

> \- M1: Provisioning interface between the 5GMS Application Provider
> and the 5GMS AF.
>
> \- P1: The 5GMS Application Provider provisions the DASH MPD
> generator, e.g. by annotating the MPD with Service Descriptions.
>
> \- U1: User Interface to the 5GMS-Aware Application.

NOTE: The 5GMS Application Provider controls the application, i.e.
controls the GUI choices.

> \- M8: Non-standardized input from the 5GMS Application Provider to
> the 5GMS-Aware Application, such as country-specific application
> behaviours (languages, on-demand catalogue, etc).

\- Input on subscriptions (e.g. 4K subscription versus SD subscription).

\- Device-specific content selection rules (e.g. SmartPhone versus Smart
TV).

\- Additional service offering features (e.g. background download
possible).

> \- C1 (one of M6 or M7): Information from the 5GMS-Aware Application
> to the 5GMS Client, e.g. user content selections.
>
> \- M6: Information flow from the DASH Player to the Media Session
> Handler.
>
> \- M7: Information flow from the Media Session Handler to the DASH
> Player.
>
> \- M5\_1: Information flow into the Media Session Handler for
> parameter provisioning (Policy Descriptions, which originate from 5GMS
> AF and 5GMS Application Provider). The Policy Descriptions contain or
> reference the detailed Service Access Information, i.e. URLs to
> activate a certain policy.
>
> \- M5\_2: Information flow from the Media Session Handler to the 5GMS
> AF. This includes:

\- input to create the Service Data Flow Templates (see TS 23.503
\[33\]) for identifying the application data flows within a PDU Session,

\- an identifier for the Dynamic Policy instance (e.g. QoS, Conditional
Zero-rating, charging, etc) and

\- optionally, Network Assistance information, e.g. bit rate
recommendations.

In its Annex K, the DASH standard \[32\] specifies so-called \"Service
Descriptions\". The purpose of Service Descriptions is to provide
additional information to a DASH player to influence its \"Selection
Logic\", e.g. a DASH player should prefer a certain set of
representations within an adaptation set. It is assumed in the following
that the DASH MPD can be annotated using Service Descriptions to give
hints for subscription models and different device types.

The 5G System specifies a number of different means to detect
application flows. When activating a Dynamic Policy, the Media Session
Handler provides a Service Data Flow Template to the 5GMS System, which
identifies the application flow(s) of interest. It is assumed here that
multiple applications are executing simultaneously on a given UE and
that each application may independently access the network. Therefore,
the Media Session Handler needs to provide (and update) these Service
Data Flow Templates in order that the application traffic can be treated
according to the corresponding Dynamic Policy.

In the following clauses, the parameter propagation for a number of
different use cases is described.

A.2 Premium QoS dynamic policy
==============================

A.2.1 General
-------------

To realise a Premium QoS service offering, the 5GMS Client should
activate a QoS Flow with characteristics matching the service needs. It
is assumed that the DASH content is prepared for different subscription
levels, e.g. 4K, HDR or SD, and for different target device types, e.g.
SmartPhone or SmartTV. When commencing playback of a DASH presentation
according to a particular subscription level (e.g. 4K), the 5GMS Client
needs to activate a QoS Flow with a matching bit rate setting.

NOTE: The 5GMS Client may choose to activate a QoS Flow with a lower bit
rate than the maximum supported by the 5G System, e.g. a small screen
SmartPhone may select different QoS settings from a large screen device.

The per-title quality and the subscription levels of an example
on-demand catalogue are illustrated in the figure below. The
subscription levels in this example are 4K, FullHD, HD, SD and 480p.
Only devices entitled to activate a 4K quality should actually select
the according representations from the MPDs. In this example, all titles
are available in SD and HD quality. Often, not all titles are available
in 4K quality. Thus, a device with a 4K subscription can only activate
reception of the HD or SD representations.

![](media/image9.jpg){width="5.09375in" height="3.75in"}

Figure A.2.1‑1: Subscription Levels for Premium QoS

The bit rate required to sustain a certain quality varies from title to
title. In the figure, the bit rate needed for *Title4* in HD is in the
same range as SD quality of *Title3*.

The various consumer-facing Network Subscription Levels define a set of
bounded Operation Ranges, as illustrated on the right side of the
figure. Each such Operation Range is conveniently modelled in the 5GMS
architecture as a Policy Template. The Policy Template for SD
subscription level (*SD Operation Range*) is authorized to activate a
maximal bit rate of *btr\#1*. The Policy Template for 4K subscription
level is authorized to activate between any low bit rate and a maximal
bit rate of *btr\#3*.

When activating a Dynamic Policy instance, the 5GMSd Client provides a
desired bit rate for the selected title. The desired bit rate can be
smaller than the maximal bit rate allowed by the Policy Template. The
5GMSd Client always activates a Dynamic Policy instance from its
assigned Network Subscription Level, even when the desired bit rate
justifies a different Policy Template.

When activating a QoS Flow for a certain subscription level and title,
the 5GMSd Client should preferably select a desired bit rate matching
the quality needed. For example, a device with an *HD Operation Range*
subscription needs a higher desired bit rate when consuming *Title3* in
HD quality and a lower desired bit rate when consuming *Title4* in HD
quality.

In some cases, the system rejects a requested QoS Flow or drops an
established QoS Flow due to insufficient available network resource. The
5GMSd Client can then try to activate a different QoS Flow with a lower
desired bit rate.

A.2.2 Procedure
---------------

The procedure for activating a Premium Qos dynamic policy is illustrated
in figure A.2.2‑1 below.

Figure A.2.2-1: Procedure for activating Premium QoS dynamic policy

Steps:

1\. The 5GMS Application Provider interacts with the 5GMS AF to set up
one or more Policy Templates (using M1). Each Policy Template is
identified by a Policy Template identifier and contains information
about how to activate the corresponding policy within the 5G System
(e.g. N5 URLs and parameters).

2\. The 5GMS Application Provider interacts with its DASH content
generation function (e.g. an MPD provider) to annotate the DASH MPD with
Service Descriptions (using P1). The Service Descriptions define the
Operational Ranges within the Media Player should operate. The DASH MPD
and the DASH Media Segments are then ingested by the 5GMS AS.

3\. The 5GMS-Aware Application is configured via M8 (step 3) with
information about the available content catalogue (e.g. resolving MPD
URLs), the available subscription identifiers (e.g. the user has a 4K
subscription or the user has an SD subscription), device type
identifiers and network policy identifiers.

The subscription identifiers and the device type identifiers are
collectively referred to as Service Description Filters in the
following.

NOTE 1: It is for further study whether network policy identifiers are
embedded in the MPD Service Descriptions or derived from the Service
Descriptions.

NOTE 2: The network policy identifier can be equal to a Policy Template
identifier when the 5GMS-Aware Application is aware about its usage
(e.g. for QoS streaming or background download). It is assumed here,
that a unique Network Policy identifier is assigned to each subscription
level.

4\. When the user selects an item via the User Interface (U1), the
5GMS-Aware Application translates the input to the needed 5GMSd API
calls.

5\. The 5GMS-Aware Application provides input (via C1) on the selected
presentation entry (i.e. MPD URL) together with a Network Policy
Identifier (the value indicates here a \"HD Premium QoS\" policy
(alternative Network Policy Identifiers can refer to e.g. 4K quality),
i.e. make the Media Session Handler request a QoS Flow) and Service
Description Filters. The Service Description Filter is used by the Media
Player to identify the usable Service Descriptions from the MPD. The
Network Policy Identifier is used by the Media Session Handler to find
the according Policy Description containing information on the Dynamic
Policy instantiation method (i.e. procedure and parameters such as
Policy Template identifier).

6\. The DASH player fetches the MPD.

7\. The Media Player selects the Service Description and applies the
Service Description Filter.

8\. The DASH player indicates to the Media Session Handler (M6) that a
\"HD Premium QoS\" network service should be activated (value of the
Network Policy Identifier). The DASH player provides input on bit rate
ranges (which may depend on the device type and the title quality). The
Media Session Handler has received one or more Policy Descriptions
together with matching Service Access Information (via M5\_1). When the
Media Session Handler has received the policy indication, the Media
Session Handler uses the Network Policy Identifier to find the procedure
and the parameters to activate the Dynamic Policy instance (i.e. find
the matching Policy Description). The Media Session Handler activates a
Dynamic Policy instance in the 5GMS AF, providing Service Data Flow
Templates identifying the DASH media flows (audio, video, etc) and to
provide the desired bit rate of the video.

9\. The Media Session Handler activates a Dynamic Policy instance with
the 5GMS AF. The 5GMS AF uses the Policy Template identifier to look up
the matching Policy Template in order to create the PCF or NEF API
invocation. As result, the Media Session Handler receives the
enforcement bit rate in the 5GMS AF response. The 5GMS Client should not
exceed this bit rate threshold.

The Service Access Information (via M5\_1) includes a list of
recommended traffic detection methods. The Media Session Handler selects
a Service Data Flow description method (e.g. 5-Tuples). When the Media
Session Handler selects:

\- 5-Tuples: For each new TCP connection, the Media Session Handler
updates the Dynamic Policy instances and adds a new 5-Tuple. For each
closed TCP connection, the Media Session Handler updates the Dynamic
Policy instances and removes the 5-Tuple of the closed TCP connection.

\- TOS or Traffic Class: The Media Session Handler sets the TOS or
Traffic Class for each new TCP connection.

\- Domain name: The Media Session Handler provides the domain name with
the Dynamic Policy Instance.

A.3 (Conditional) Zero Rating dynamic policy
============================================

A.3.1 General
-------------

In the case of (Conditional) Zero Rating, the quality of a video
streaming service should not exceed a certain bit rate threshold (called
the policy threshold). This can be realized by deploying a traffic
shaper in the network (e.g. a policing function in the UPF) or by
instructing the DASH Player not to exceed a certain policy threshold bit
rate. The policy threshold may be network-specific, i.e. depending on
the 5G System. The following realization assumes the latter, i.e. the
DASH Player is not exceeding the bit rate policy and the UPF is just
monitoring the compliance of the application flows (one or more TCP
and/or UDP flows). The MPD is annotated using DASH Service Descriptions
in such a way that the DASH Player can identify which maximal
representation bit rates still comply with the policy threshold.

Figure A.3.1-1 below illustrates the per-title quality and the policy
threshold. For *Title1* and *Title2*, the 5GMSd Client can activate the
SD and HD representations. For *Title3*, the 5GMSd Client can activate
the 480p and the SD representations. For *Title4*, the 5GMSd Client can
activate all available representations (i.e. SD and HD).

Figure A.3.1‑1: Policy threshold versus quality

When the 5GMSd Client receives the bit rate of the policy threshold from
the network, the 5GMSd Client filters the MPD for policy-compliant
representations (i.e. those that lie at or below the policy threshold).

A.3.2 Procedure
---------------

The procedure for activating a (Conditional) Zero Rating dynamic policy
is illustrated in figure A.3.2‑1 below.

Figure A.3.2‑1: Procedure for activating (Conditional) Zero Rating
dynamic policy

Steps:

1\. The 5GMS Application Provider interacts with the 5GMS AF to set up
one or more Policy Templates. Each Policy Template is identified by a
Policy Template identifier and contains information about how to
activate the corresponding policy within the 5G System (e.g. N5 URLs and
parameters).

2\. The 5GMS Application Provider interacts with its DASH content
generation function (e.g. an MPD provider) to annotate the DASH MPD with
Service Descriptions (step 2). The intention of the Service Descriptions
here is that the DASH Player can identify those representation
combinations which do not exceed the bit rate requirement.

3\. The 5GMSAware Application is configured via M8 with information
about the available content catalogue (e.g. resolving MPD URLs), the
available subscription identifiers (e.g. the user has a 4K content
subscription or the user has an SD subscription), device type
identifiers.

The 5GMSd-Aware Application is configured via M8 about the available
(Conditional) Zero Rating policy. This includes the Network Policy Ids.

4\. When a user selects an item via the User Interface (U1), the
5GMS-Aware Application translates the input to the needed 5GMSd API
calls.

5\. The 5GMS Aware Application provides input (via C1) on the selected
presentation entry (i.e. MPD URL) and also on the Network Policy Id (the
value in this case indicates a (Conditional) Zero-Rating policy, i.e.
make the Media Session Handler request the policy threshold parameter
from the network).

NOTE: C1 is an abstract interface and indicates that the 5GMS-Aware
Application may either first use M6 or M7 for the interactions with the
5GMS Client.

6\. The Media Session Handler uses the Network Policy Identifier to find
the procedure and the parameters to activate the Dynamic Policy Instance
(here a (Conditional) Zero Rating policy). The Media Session Handler has
received one or more Policy Descriptions together with matching Service
Access Information (via M5\_1). The Media Session Handler uses the
Network Policy Identifier as a key to find the correct Policy
Description. Here, the Network Policy Identifier indicates a
(Conditional) Zero Rating policy. The Media Session Handler should
activate a dynamic policy in the 5GMS AF, providing Service Data Flow
Template information about the DASH media flows (audio, video, etc.) and
retrieving the bit rate threshold, which cannot be exceeded to comply
with the policy. The Media Session Handler receives (as result of the
Dynamic Policy activation) some information on the policy enforcement
(*enforcementMethod* and/or *enforcementBitrate*), so that the
representation selection logic (bit rate adaptation function) in the
DASH Player can consider the effects of the enforcement scheme.

7\. The Media Session Handler activates the Dynamic Policy instance on
M5, providing a Policy Template identifier. Upon positive response, the
Media Session Handler notifies the DASH Player, providing Service
Descriptor Filters. The Media Session Handler may receive these Service
Descriptor Filters with the response, or it may look up the Service
Descriptor Filter values by a response value. Alternatively, the Media
Session Handler receives a maximum bit rate with the response and the
Media Session Handler derives the Service Descriptor Filter. The Media
Session Handler may also receive information about Policy Enforcement,
e.g. what type of traffic shaper will throttle the bit rate.

The Media Session Handler may need to update the Dynamic Policy
instance, depending on the selected traffic detection method. For
example, when the Media Session Handler uses 5-Tuples, the Media Session
Handler needs to update the Dynamic Policy instance with every newly
opened and every closed TCP connection.

8\. The DASH Player fetches the MPD of the selected content.

9.The Service Descriptor Filter is used by the DASH Player to filter
policy-compliant Service Descriptions from the MPD. The DASH Access
Engine or Selection Logic (see ISO/IEC 23009-1 \[32\] figure K.1)
selects only adaptation sets and representations according to the
filter. Here, the DASH Player fetches the MPD after the notification
from the Media Session Handler.

A.4 Background Download
=======================

A.4.1 General
-------------

In the case of Background Download, the asset is acquired in the
background, prior to viewing. Many application services offer the
capability of acquiring a VoD item for later consumption. The 5GMS-Aware
Application triggers the Media Session Handler to acquire the item,
providing a background download network policy id.

NOTE: Here, the DASH Player is handling the acquisition, since the DASH
Player contains the MPD processing and the DASH Access engine parts.
Other realizations would use a separate background download agent, which
is not even try to decode and render the video.

Figure A.4.1‑1 below illustrates the representation marking for
background download. The MPD may be annotated with Service Descriptions
clearly identifying representations intended for download. Here,
*Title1* should be downloaded in Full HD quality and all other titles in
regular HD quality.

A.4.2 Procedure
---------------

The procedure for activating a Background Download dynamic policy is
illustrated in figure A.3.2‑1 below.

Figure A.3.2‑1: Procedure for activating Background Download dynamic
policy

Steps:

1\. The 5GMS Application Provider interacts with the 5GMS AF to set up
one or more Policy Templates (M1). Each Policy Template is identified by
a Policy Template identifier and contains information about how to
activate the according policy within the 5G System (e.g. N5 URLs and
parameters).

2\. The 5GMS Application Provider also interacts with its DASH content
generation function (e.g. an MPD provider) to annotate the DASH MPD with
Service Descriptions, e.g. to identify, which representation is intended
for background download.

3\. The 5GMS-Aware Application is configured via M8 with information
about the available content catalogue (e.g. resolving MPD URLs), the
available subscription identifiers (e.g. the user has a 4K subscription
or the user has an SD subscription), device type identifiers.

The 5GMSd-Aware Application is configured via M8 about the available
background download policy. This includes the Network Policy Id which
hints a background download policy.

4\. When a user selects an item via the User Interface (U1) for
Background Download the 5GMS-Aware Application translates the input to
the needed 5GMSd API calls.

5\. The 5GMS-Aware Application provides input (via C1) on the selected
presentation entry (i.e. MPD URL) and also on the Network Policy
Identifier (indicating a background download policy, i.e. make the Media
Session Handler request a bearer suitable for Background Download).

NOTE: C1 is an abstract interface and indicates that the 5GMS-Aware
Application may either first use M6 or M7 for the interactions with the
5GMS Client.

6\. The Media Session Handler uses the Network Policy Identifier to find
the procedure and the parameters to activate the Dynamic Policy Instance
(here a Background Download policy). The Media Session Handler has
received one or more Policy Descriptions together with matching Service
Access Information (via M5\_1). The Media Session Handler uses the
Network Policy Identifier as a key to find the correct Policy
Description. The Media Session Handler should activate a Dynamic Policy
in the 5GMS AF, providing Service Data Flow Template information of the
media flows (audio, video, etc). The Media Session Handler can also
receive information on a bit rate policing (*enforcementMethod* and/or
*enforcementBitrate*), e.g. that the bit rate is actively limited.

7\. The Media Session Handler activates the Dynamic Policy instance on
M5, providing the Policy Template identifier and additional parameters.
Upon positive response, the Media Session handler notifies the DASH
Player to start the Background Download. The notification contains a
Service Descriptor Filters, which is used by the DASH Player to filter
policy-compliant Service Descriptions from the MPD. The Media Session
Handler may receive the Service Descriptor Filters with the response or
may look up the Service Descriptor Filter values by a response value
(e.g. derived from a maximum bit rate indication).

The Media Session Handler may need to update the Dynamic Policy
instance, depending on the selected traffic detection method. For
example, when the Media Session Handler uses 5-Tuples, it needs to
update the Dynamic Policy instance with every newly opened and every
closed TCP connection.

8\. The DASH Player fetches the MPD of the selected content.

9\. The DASH Access Engine / Selection Logic (see ISO 23009-1 \[32\]
figure K.1) selects only adaptation sets and representations according
to the filter (i.e. suitable for Background Download). Here, the DASH
Player fetches the MPD after the notification from the Media Session
Handler.

######## Annex B (informative): Content Hosting Configuration examples

B.1 Pull-based content ingest example
=====================================

B.1.1 Overview
--------------

1\. The 5GMSd Client on the UE requests a media resource via M4d.

2\. The 5GMSd AS determines that it does not have a cached copy of the
requested media resource.

3\. The 5GMSd AS transforms the M4d request URL into a request to the
5GMSd Application Provider\'s origin server via M2d.

B.1.2 Desired URL mapping
-------------------------

In the example shown in table B.1.2‑1 below, media resources are exposed
at M4d from a default canonical domain 5gmsd-as.mno.net determined by
the 5GMSd System operator, and also from a custom domain name alias
mno‑cdn.5gmsd-ap.com that has been configured by the 5GMSd Application
Provider.

B.2 Push-based content ingest example
=====================================

B.2.0 Overview
--------------

1\. The 5GMSd Application Provider uploads content to the 5GMSd AS via
M2d.

2\. The 5GMSd AS rewrites the M2d upload URL to an M4d downlink URL that
is exposed to the 5GMSd Client on the UE.

B.2.1 Desired URL mapping
-------------------------

In the example shown in table B.2.1‑1, media resources are pushed into
the 5GMSd AS at M2d by the 5GMSd Application Provider and exposed to the
5GMSd Client at M4d using the canonical name of the 5GMSd AF
5gmsd-as.mno.net and an additional domain name alias
mno-cdn.5gmsd-ap.com configured by the 5GMSd Application Provider.

the present document with respect to the encoding of information
elements and methods within the API(s).

NOTE 2: The semantics and procedures, as well as conditions, e.g. for
the applicability and allowed combinations of attributes or values, not
expressed in the OpenAPI definitions but defined in other parts of the
specification also apply.

C.2 Data Types applicable to several APIs
=========================================

For the purpose of referencing entities defined in this clause, it shall
be assumed that the OpenAPI definitions below are contained in a
physical file named \"TS26512\_CommonData.yaml\".
