This Telecommunication Standard (TS) describes the detailed mapping from
input blocks of monophonic or stereophonic audio samples in 16 bit
uniform PCM format to encoded blocks and from encoded blocks to output
blocks of reconstructed monophonic or stereophonic audio samples. The
coding scheme is an extension of the AMR-WB coding scheme \[3\] and is
referred to as extended AMR-WB or AMR-WB+ codec. It comprises all AMR-WB
speech codec modes including VAD/DTX/CNG \[2\]\[8\]\[10\] as well as
extended functionality for encoding general audio signals such as music,
speech, mixed, and other signals.

In the case of discrepancy between the requirements described in the
present document and the ANSI-C code computational description of these
requirements contained in \[4\], \[5\], the description in \[4\], \[5\],
respectively, will prevail. The ANSI-C code is not described in the
present document, see \[4\], \[5\] for a description of the
floating-point or, respectively, fixed-point ANSI-C code.

3 Definitions and abbreviations
===============================

3.1 Definitions
---------------

For the purposes of the present document, the following terms and apply.

**adaptive codebook:** The adaptive codebook contains excitation vectors
that are adapted for every subframe. The adaptive codebook is derived
from the long-term filter state. The lag value can be viewed as an index
into the adaptive codebook.

**algebraic codebook:** A fixed codebook where algebraic code is used to
populate the excitation vectors (innovation vectors). The excitation
contains a small number of nonzero pulses with predefined interlaced
sets of potential positions. The amplitudes and positions of the pulses
of the k^th^ excitation codevector can be derived from its index k
through a rule requiring no or minimal physical storage, in contrast
with stochastic codebooks whereby the path from the index to the
associated codevector involves look-up tables.

**anti-sparseness processing:** An adaptive post-processing procedure
applied to the fixed codebook vector in order to reduce perceptual
artifacts from a sparse fixed codebook vector.

**closed‑loop pitch analysis:** This is the adaptive codebook search,
i.e., a process of estimating the pitch (lag) value from the weighted
input speech and the long term filter state. In the closed‑loop search,
the lag is searched using error minimization loop
(analysis‑by‑synthesis). In the adaptive multi-rate wideband codec,
closed‑loop pitch search is performed for every subframe.

**direct form coefficients:** One of the formats for storing the short
term filter parameters. In the adaptive multi-rate wideband codec, all
filters which are used to modify speech samples use direct form
coefficients.

**fixed codebook:** The fixed codebook contains excitation vectors for
speech synthesis filters. The contents of the codebook are non‑adaptive
(i.e., fixed). In the adaptive multi-rate wideband codec, the fixed
codebook is implemented using an algebraic codebook.

**fractional lags:** A set of lag values having sub‑sample resolution.
In the adaptive multi-rate wideband codec a sub‑sample resolution of
¼^th^ or ½^nd^ of a sample is used.

**super frame:** A time interval equal to 1024 samples (80ms at a 12.8
kHz sampling rate).

**frame:** A time interval equal to 256 samples (20ms at a 12.8 kHz
sampling rate).

**Immittance Spectral Frequencies:** (see Immittance Spectral Pair)

**Immittance Spectral Pair:** Transformation of LPC parameters.
Immittance Spectral Pairs are obtained by decomposing the inverse filter
transfer function A(z) to a set of two transfer functions, one having
even symmetry and the other having odd symmetry. The Immittance Spectral
Pairs (also called as Immittance Spectral Frequencies) are the roots of
these polynomials on the z-unit circle.

**integer lags:** A set of lag values having whole sample resolution.

**interpolating filter:** An FIR filter used to produce an estimate of
sub-sample resolution samples, given an input sampled with integer
sample resolution. In this implementation, the interpolating filter has
low pass filter characteristics. Thus the adaptive codebook consists of
the low-pass filtered interpolated past excitation.

**inverse filter:** This filter removes the short term correlation from
the speech signal. The filter models an inverse frequency response of
the vocal tract.

**lag:** The long term filter delay. This is typically the true pitch
period, or its multiple or sub‑multiple.

**LP analysis window:** For each frame, the short term filter
coefficients are computed using the high pass filtered speech samples
within the analysis window. In the adaptive multi-rate wideband codec,
the length of the analysis window is always 384 samples. For all the
modes, a single asymmetric window is used to generate a single set of LP
coefficients. The 5 ms look-ahead is used in the analysis.

**LP coefficients:** Linear Prediction (LP) coefficients (also referred
as Linear Predictive Coding (LPC) coefficients) is a generic descriptive
term for the short term filter coefficients.

**open‑loop pitch search:** A process of estimating the near optimal lag
directly from the weighted speech input. This is done to simplify the
pitch analysis and confine the closed‑loop pitch search to a small
number of lags around the open‑loop estimated lags. In the adaptive
multi-rate wideband codec, an open‑loop pitch search is performed in
every other subframe.

**residual:** The output signal resulting from an inverse filtering
operation.

**short term synthesis filter:** This filter introduces, into the
excitation signal, short term correlation which models the impulse
response of the vocal tract.

**perceptual weighting filter:** This filter is employed in the
analysis‑by‑synthesis search of the codebooks. The filter exploits the
noise masking properties of the formants (vocal tract resonances) by
weighting the error less in regions near the formant frequencies and
more in regions away from them.

**subframe:** A time interval equal to 64 samples (5ms at 12.8 kHz
sampling rate).

**vector quantization:** A method of grouping several parameters into a
vector and quantizing them simultaneously.

**zero input response:** The output of a filter due to past inputs, i.e.
due to the present state of the filter, given that an input of zeros is
applied.

**zero state response:** The output of a filter due to the present
input, given that no past inputs have been applied, i.e., given that the
state information in the filter is all zeroes.

4 Outline description
=====================

This TS is structured as follows:

Section 4.1 contains a functional description of the audio parts
including the A/D and D/A functions. Section 4.2 describes input format
for the AMR-WB+ encoder and the output format for the AMR-WB+ decoder.
Section 4.3 presents a simplified description of the principles of the
AMR-WB codec. In subclause 4.4, the sequence and subjective importance
of encoded parameters are given.

Section 5 presents the functional description of the encoding functions
of the AMR-WB+ extension modes, whereas clause 6 describes the decoding
procedures for the extension modes. In section 7, the detailed bit
allocation of the AMR-WB+ codec extension modes is tabulated. The AMR-WB
speech modes are functionally unchanged as well as their bit allocation.
Detailed information on them is found in \[1\].

4.1 Functional description of audio parts
-----------------------------------------

The analogue‑to‑digital and digital‑to‑analogue conversion will in
principle comprise the elements given below. In case of stereo codec
operation, the given principles will be applied to the 2 available audio
channels.

1\) Analogue to uniform digital PCM

\- microphone;

\- input level adjustment device;

‑ input anti‑aliasing filter;

‑ sample‑hold device sampling at 16/24/32/48 kHz;

‑ analogue‑to‑uniform digital conversion to 16‑bit representation.

The uniform format shall be represented in two\'s complement.

2\) Uniform digital PCM to analogue

‑ conversion from 16‑bit uniform PCM sampled at 16/24/32/48 kHz to
analogue;

‑ a hold device;

‑ reconstruction filter including x/sin( x ) correction;

‑ output level adjustment device;

‑ earphone or loudspeaker.

In the terminal equipment, the A/D function may be achieved

‑ by direct conversion to 14‑bit uniform PCM format;

For the D/A operation, the inverse operations take place.

4.2 Preparation of input samples
--------------------------------

The encoder is fed with data from one/two input channels comprising of
samples with a resolution of 16 bits in a 16‑bit word. The decoder
outputs data in the same format and number of output channels. Though,
mono output of decoded stereo signals is supported.

4.3 Principles of the extended adaptive multi-rate wideband codec
-----------------------------------------------------------------

The AMR-WB+ audio codec contains all the AMR-WB speech codec modes 1-9
and AMR-WB VAD and DTX. AMR-WB+ extends the AMR-WB codec by adding TCX,
bandwidth extension, and stereo.

The AMR-WB+ audio codec processes input frames equal to 2048 samples at
an internal sampling frequency *F~s~* . The internal sampling frequency
is limited to the range 12800-38400 Hz, see section 8 for more details.
The 2048-sample frames are split into two critically sampled equal
frequency bands. This results in two superframes of a 1024 samples
corresponding to the low frequency (LF) and high frequency (HF) band.
Each superframe is divided into four 256-samples frames.

Sampling at the internal sampling rate is obtained by using a variable
sampling conversion scheme, which re-samples the input signal.

The LF and HF signals are then encoded using two different approaches:
the LF is encoded and decoded using the \"core\" encoder/decoder, based
on switched ACELP and transform coded excitation (TCX). In ACELP mode,
the standard AMR-WB codec is used. The HF signal is encoded with
relatively few bits (16 bits/frame) using a bandwidth extension (BWE)
method.

The basic set of rates are built based on AMR-WB rates in addition to
bandwidth extension. The basic set of mono rates are shown in Table 1.

Table 1: Basic set of mono rates

+----------------------+---------------------------+
| Mono rate(incl. BWE) | Corresponding AMR-WB mode |
|                      |                           |
| *(bits/frame)*       |                           |
+----------------------+---------------------------+
| 208                  | NA                        |
+----------------------+---------------------------+
| 240                  | NA                        |
+----------------------+---------------------------+
| 272                  | 12.65                     |
+----------------------+---------------------------+
| 304                  | 14.25                     |
+----------------------+---------------------------+
| 336                  | 15.85                     |
+----------------------+---------------------------+
| 384                  | 18.25                     |
+----------------------+---------------------------+
| 416                  | 19.85                     |
+----------------------+---------------------------+
| 480                  | 23.05                     |
+----------------------+---------------------------+

Note that in ACELP mode of operation, compared to AMR-WB, the VAD bit is
removed, two bits per frame are added for gain prediction, and 2 bits
are added for signaling frame encoding type. This adds 3 bits per frame.
Note also that 16 bits/frame is always used for bandwidth extension (to
encode the HF band). The first two basic mono rates are similar to other
rates except that they use a fixed codebook with 20 bits or 28 bits,
respectively.

For stereo coding, the set of stereo extension rates given in Table 2
are used.

Table 2: Basic set of stereo rates

+------------------------------------+-----+
| Stereo extension rates (incl. BWE) |     |
|                                    |     |
| (Bits/frame)                       |     |
+------------------------------------+-----+
| 40                                 | 104 |
+------------------------------------+-----+
| 48                                 | 112 |
+------------------------------------+-----+
| 56                                 | 120 |
+------------------------------------+-----+
| 64                                 | 128 |
+------------------------------------+-----+
| 72                                 | 136 |
+------------------------------------+-----+
| 80                                 | 144 |
+------------------------------------+-----+
| 88                                 | 152 |
+------------------------------------+-----+
| 96                                 | 160 |
+------------------------------------+-----+

Note that the bandwidth extension is applied to both channels which
requires additional 16 bits/frame for the stereo extension.

A certain mode of operation is obtained by choosing a rate from Table 1,
in case of mono operation, or by combining a rate from Table 1 with a
stereo extension rate from Table 2, in case of stereo operation. The
resulting coding bitrate is (mono rate + stereo rate) Fs / 512.

**Examples**:

\- For an internal sampling frequency of 32 kHz by choosing mono rate
equal to 384 bits/frame and without stereo, we can obtain a bit-rate
equal to 24 kbps and the frame length would be of a 16 ms duration.

\- For an internal sampling frequency of 25.6 kHz by choosing mono rate
equal to 272 bits/frame and stereo rate equal to 88 bits/frame, we can
obtain a bit-rate equal to 18 kbps and the frame length would be of a 20
ms duration.

**Note**. The documentation of the AMR-WB+ floating-point C-code in
\[4\] contains further information on how to use the executables
compiled from this source code to exercise the various possible uses, in
the codec, of mono bit rate, stereo bit rate and internal sampling
frequency, and the resulting total bit rates.

### 4.3.1 Encoding and decoding structure

Figure 1 presents the AMR-WB+ encoder structure. The input signal is
separated in two bands. The first band is the low-frequency (LF) signal,
which is critically sampled at Fs/2 . The second band is the
high-frequency (HF) signal, which is also downsampled to obtain a
critically sampled signal. The LF and HF signals are then encoded using
two different approaches: the LF signal is encoded and decoded using the
\"core\" encoder/decoder, based on switched ACELP and transform coded
excitation (TCX). In ACELP mode, the standard AMR-WB codec is used. The
HF signal is encoded with relatively few bits using a bandwidth
extension (BWE) method.

The parameters transmitted from encoder to decoder are the mode
selection bits, the LF parameters and the HF parameters. The parameters
for each 1024-sample super-frame are decomposed into four packets of
identical size.

When the input signal is stereo, the Left and right channels are
combined into mono signal for ACELP/TCX encoding, whereas the stereo
encoding receives both input channels.

Figure 2 presents the AMR-WB+ decoder structure. The LF and HF bands are
decoded separately after which they are combined in a synthesis
filterbank. If the output is restricted to mono only, the stereo
parameters are omitted and the decoder operates in mono mode.

### 4.3.2 LP analysis and synthesis in low-frequency band

The AMR-WB+ codec applies LP analysis for both the ACELP and TCX modes
when encoding the LF signal. The LP coefficients are interpolated
linearly at every 64-sample sub-frame. The LP analysis window is a
half-cosine of length 384 samples.

### 4.3.3 ACELP and TCX coding

To encode the core mono signal (0-Fs/4 kHz band), the AMR-WB+ codec
utilises either ACELP or TCX coding for each frame. The coding mode is
selected based on closed-loop analysis-by-synthesis method. Only
256-sample frames are considered for ACELP frames (as in AMR-WB),
whereas frames of 256, 512 or 1024 samples are possible in TCX mode.

ACELP encoding and decoding are similar to standard AMR-WB speech codec.
The ACELP coding consists of LTP analysis and synthesis and algebraic
codebook excitation. The ACELP coding mode is used in AMR-WB operation
within AMR-WB+ codec.

In TCX mode the perceptually weighted signal is processed in the
transform domain. The Fourier transformed weighted signal is quantised
using split multi-rate lattice quantisation (algebraic VQ). Transform is
calculated in 1024, 512 or 256 samples windows. The excitation signal is
recovered by inverse filtering the quantised weighted signal through the
inverse weighting filter (same weighting filter as in AMR-WB).

### 4.3.4 Coding of high-frequency band

Whereas the LF signal (0-Fs/4 kHz band) is encoded using the previously
described switched ACELP/TCX encoding approach, the HF signal is encoded
using a low-rate parametric bandwidth extension (BWE) approach. Only
gains and spectral envelope information are transmitted in the BWE
approach used to encode the HF signal.

The bandwidth extension is done separately for left and right channel in
stereo operation.

### 4.3.5 Stereo coding

In the case of stereo coding, a similar band decomposition as in the
mono case is used. The two channels L and R are decomposed into LF and
HF signals. The LF signals of the two channels are down-mixed to form an
LF mono signal, (0-Fs/4 kHz band). This mono signal is encoded
separately by the core codec.

The LF part of the two channels is further decomposed into two bands
(0-5Fs/128 kHz band) and (5Fs/128 kHz- Fs/4 kHz band). The very low
frequency (VLF) band is critically down-sampled, and the side signal is
computed. The resulting signal is semi-parametrically encoded in the
frequency domain using the algebraic VQ. The frequency domain encoding
is performed in closed loop by choosing among 40-, 80- and 160-sample
frame lengths.

The high frequency part of the LF signals (Midband) are parametrically
encoded. In the decoder, the parametric model is applied on the mono
signal excitation in order to restore the high frequency part of the
original LF part of the two channels.

The HF part of the two channels are encoded by using parametric BWE
described below.

### 4.3.6 Low complexity operation

In the low complexity operation (use case B) the decision on the usage
of ACELP and TCX mode is done in an open-loop manner. This approach
introduces computational savings in the encoder.

### 4.3.7 Frame erasure concealment

When missing packets occur at the receiver, the decoder applies
concealment. The concealment algorithm depends on the mode of the
correctly received packets preceding and following the missing packet.
Concealment uses either time-domain coefficient extrapolation, as in
AMR-WB, or frequency-domain interpolation for some of the TCX modes.

### 4.3.8 Bit allocation

The bit allocation for the different parameters in the low-frequency
band coding (Core) (0-Fs/4 kHz band) is shown in Tables 3, 4, 5, and 6.
Note that there are two mode bits sent in each 256-sample packet. These
mode bits are not shown in the bit allocation tables. The bit
allocations for the stereo part is shown in Tables 7, 8, and 9. Note
that there are also two additional mode bits for the VLF stereo encoder,
which are not shown in the bit allocation. The bit allocation for the
stereo HF part is by definition that of the bandwidth extension, as
presented in Tables 7,8 and 9.

Tables 2 and 3 show the total bits per 256-sample packet, including mode
bits.

5 Functional description of the encoder
=======================================

In this clause, the different functions of the encoder extension modes
represented in Figure 1 are described. Input signals are understood as
internal, i.e. sampled at the internal sampling frequency *Fs*.

5.1 Input signal pre-processing
-------------------------------

Input signals are pre-processed in order to bring them to the internal
sampling frequency of the encoder *Fs kHz*. The signal is upsampled by a
factor *K* (related to the desired internal sampling frequency),
filtered by a a low pass filter and then downsampled by a factor 180.
This operation is efficiently implemented by a polyphase filter
implementation.

The resulting signals are further decomposed into two equal critically
sampled bands as shown in the following figure:

![](media/image6.wmf){width="5.346527777777778in"
height="1.4319444444444445in"}

At an internal sampling rate of *Fs kHz*, the lower band signals are
obtained by first low-pass filtering to *Fs*/4 kHz critically
downsampling the low-pass filtered signal to Fs/2 kHz. The higher band
signals are obtained by band-pass filtering the input signals to
frequencies above Fs/4 kHz, and critically downsampling the high-pass
filtered signal to Fs/2kHz sampling frequency.

### 5.1.1 High Pass Filtering

The lower band signals are high pass filtered. The high-pass filter
serves as a precaution against undesired low frequency components. A
high pass filter is used, and it is given by

![](media/image7.wmf){width="1.875in" height="0.5in"}

where the filter parameters are dependent on the internal sampling rate.

### 5.1.2 Stereo Signal Downmixing/Bandsplitting

When the input audio signal is stereo, the lower band mono signal is
obtained by downmixing the left and right channels according to the
following

![](media/image8.wmf){width="1.9583333333333333in"
height="0.2361111111111111in"}

where ![](media/image9.wmf){width="0.4722222222222222in"
height="0.2361111111111111in"}, resp.
![](media/image10.wmf){width="0.4722222222222222in"
height="0.2361111111111111in"}, is the lower band signal from the left,
resp. right, channels. The lower band mono signal is supplied to the
core low band encoder for TCX/ACELP encoding.

For stereo encoding, the obtained downmixed mono signal
![](media/image11.wmf){width="0.4861111111111111in"
height="0.2361111111111111in"} and the right channel signal
![](media/image12.wmf){width="0.4722222222222222in"
height="0.2361111111111111in"} are further split into two bands: a
critically sampled low frequency band and a residual high frequency band
according to the following diagram

![](media/image13.wmf){width="5.378472222222222in"
height="1.4229166666666666in"}

The critically sampled low band output signals,
![](media/image14.wmf){width="0.5416666666666666in" height="0.25in"} and
![](media/image15.wmf){width="0.5138888888888888in" height="0.25in"} are
fed to the stereo low band encoder, while the signals
![](media/image16.wmf){width="0.5965277777777778in" height="0.25in"} and
![](media/image17.wmf){width="0.5833333333333334in" height="0.25in"} to
the stereo mid band encoder.

5.2 Principle of the hybrid ACELP/TCX core encoding
---------------------------------------------------

The encoding algorithm at the core of the AMR-WB+ codec is based on a
hybrid ACELP/TCX model. For every block of input signal, the encoder
decides (either in open-loop or closed-loop) which encoding model (ACELP
or TCX) is best. The ACELP model is a time-domain, predictive encoder,
best suited for speech and transient signals. The AMR-WB encoder is used
in ACELP modes. Alternatively, the TCX model is a transform-based
encoder, and is more appropriate for typical music samples. Frame
lengths of variable sizes are possible in TCX mode, as will be explained
in Section 5.2.1.

In Sections 5.2.1 to 5.2.4, the general principles of the hybrid
ACELP/TCX core encoder will be presented. Then Section 5.3 and its
subsections will give the details of the ACELP and TCX encoding modes.

### 5.2.1 Timing chart of the ACELP and TCX modes

The ACELP/TCX core encoder takes a mono signal as input, at a sampling
frequency of Fs/2 kHz. This signal is processed in super-frames of 1024
samples in duration. Within each 1024-sample super-frame, several
encoding modes are possible, depending on the signal structure. These
modes are: 256-sample ACELP, 256-sample TCX, 512-sample TCX and
1024-sample TCX. These encoding modes will be described further, but
first we look at the different possible mode combinations, described by
a timing chart.

Figure 4 shows the timing chart of all possible modes within an
1024-sample superframe. As the figure shows, each 256-sample frame
within a super-frame can be into one of four possible modes, which we
call ACELP, TCX256, TCX512 and TCX1024. When in ACELP mode, the
corresponding 256-sample frame is encoded with AMR-WB. In TCX256 mode,
the frame is encoded using TCX with a 256-sample support, plus 32
samples of look-ahead used for overlap-and add since TCX is a transform
coding approach. The TCX512 mode means that two consecutive 256-sample
frames are grouped to be encoded as a single 512-sample block, using TCX
with a 512-sample support plus 64 samples look-ahead. Note that the
TCX512 mode is only allowed by grouping either the first two 256-sample
frames of the super-frame, or the last two 256-sample frames. Finally,
the TCX1024 mode indicates that all 256-sample frames within the
super-frame are grouped together to be encoded in a single block using
TCX with an 1024-sample support plus 128 samples look-ahead.

height="5.219444444444444in"}

### 5.2.2 ACELP/TCX mode combinations and mode encoding

From Figure 4, there are exactly 26 different ACELP/TCX mode
combinations within an 1024-sample superframe. These are shown in
Table10.

Table 10: Possible mode combinations in an 1024-sample super-frame

  -------------- -------------- -------------- --------------
  (0, 0, 0, 0)   (0, 0, 0, 1)   (2, 2, 0, 0)   
  (1, 0, 0, 0)   (1, 0, 0, 1)   (2, 2, 1, 0)   
  (0, 1, 0, 0)   (0, 1, 0, 1)   (2, 2, 0, 1)   
  (1, 1, 0, 0)   (1, 1, 0, 1)   (2, 2, 1, 1)   
  (0, 0, 1, 0)   (0, 0, 1, 1)   (0, 0, 2, 2)   
  (1, 0, 1, 0)   (1, 0, 1, 1)   (1, 0, 2, 2)   
  (0, 1, 1, 0)   (0, 1, 1, 1)   (0, 1, 2, 2)   (2, 2, 2, 2)
  (1, 1, 1, 0)   (1, 1, 1, 1)   (1, 1, 2, 2)   (3, 3, 3, 3)
  -------------- -------------- -------------- --------------

We interpret each quadruplet of numbers (*m*~0~, *m*~1~, *m*~2~, *m*~3~)
in Table 10 as follows: *m*~k~ is the mode indication for the *k^th^*
256-sample frame in the 1024-sample super-frame, where *m*~k~ can take
the following values:

*- m*~k~ = 0 means the mode for frame *k* is 256-sample ACELP

*- m*~k~ = 1 means the mode for frame *k* is 256-sample TCX

*- m*~k~ = 2 means the mode for frame *k* is 512-sample TCX

*- m*~k~ = 3 means the mode for frame *k* is 1024-sample TCX

Obviously, when the first 256-sample frame is in mode \"2\" (512-sample
TCX), the second 256-sample frame must also be in mode 2. Similarly,
when the third 256-sample frame is in mode \"2\" (512-sample TCX), the
fourth 256-sample frame must also be in mode 2. And there is only one
possible mode configuration including the value \"3\" (1024-sample TCX),
namely all four 256-sample frames are in the same mode (*m*~k~ = 3 for
*k* = 0, 1, 2 and 3). This rigid frame structure can be exploited to aid
in frame erasure concealment.

As discussed above, the parameters for each 1024-sample super-frame are
actually decomposed into four frames of identical size. To increase
robustness, the mode bits are actually sent as two bits (the values of
*m*~k~) in each transmitted frame. For example, if the superframe is
encoded in a full 1024-sample TCX frame, which is then decomposed into
four packets of equal size, then each of these four packets will contain
the binary value \"11\" (mode *m*~k~ = 3) as mode indicator.

### 5.2.3 ACELP/TCX closed-loop mode selection

The best mode combination out of the 26 possible combinations of Table
10 is determined in closed-loop. This means that the signal in each
256-sample frame within an 1024-sample super-frame has to be encoded in
several modes before selecting the best combination. This closed-loop
approach is explained in Figure 5.

The left portion of Figure 5 (Trials) shows what encoding mode is
applied to each 256-sample frame in 11 successive trials. Fr0 to Fr3
refer to Frame 0 to Frame 3 in the super-frame. The trial number (1 to
11) indicates a step in the closed-loop mode-selection process. Note
that each 256-sample frame is involved in only four of the 11 encoding
trials. When more than 1 frame is involved in a trial (lines 5, 10 and
11 of Figure 5), then TCX of the corresponding length is applied (TCX512
or TCX1024). The right portion of Figure 5 gives an example of mode
selection, where the final decision (after Trial 11) is 1024-sample TCX.
This would result in sending a value of 3 for the mode in all four
packets for this super-frame. Bold numbers in the example at the right
of Figure 5 show at what point a mode decision is taken in the
intermediate steps of the mode selection process. The final mode
decision is only known after Trial 11.

The mode selection process shown in Figure 5 proceeds as follows. First,
in trials 1 and 2, ACELP (AMR-WB) then 256-sample TCX encoding are tried
in the first 256-sample frame (Fr0). Then, a mode selection is made for
Fr0 between these two modes. The selection criterion is the average
segmental SNR between the weighted speech *x~w~*(*n*) and the
synthesized weighted speech
![](media/image19.wmf){width="0.4166666666666667in" height="0.25in"}.
The segmental SNR in subframe *i* is defined as

![](media/image20.wmf){width="2.8055555555555554in" height="0.94375in"}

where *N* is the length of the subframe (equivalent to a 64-sample
sub-frame in the encoder). Then, the average segmental SNR is defined as

![](media/image21.wmf){width="1.9027777777777777in" height="0.5in"}

where *N~SF~* is the number of subframes in the frame. Since a frame can
be either 256, 512 or 1024 samples in length, *N~SF~* can be either 4, 8
or 16. In the example of Figure 5, we assume that, according to the
![](media/image22.wmf){width="0.5833333333333334in"
height="0.2638888888888889in"}decision criterion, mode ACELP was
retained over TCX. Then, in trials 3 and 4, the same mode comparison is
made for Fr1 between ACELP and 256-sample TCX. Here, we assume that
256-sample TCX was better than ACELP, based again on the segmental SNR
measure described above. This choice is indicated in bold on line 4 of
the example at the right of Figure 5. Then, in trial 5, Fr0 and Fr1 are
grouped together to form a 512-sample frame which is encoded using
512-sample TCX. The algorithm now has to choose between 512-sample TCX
for the first 2 frames, compared to ACELP in the first frame and TCX256
in the second frame. In this example, on line 5 in bold, the sequence
ACELP-TCX256 was selected over TCX-512, according to the segmental SNR
criterion.

Figure 5: Closed-loop selection of ACELP/TCX mode combination

The same procedure as trials 1 to 5 is then applied to the third and
fourth frames (Fr2 and Fr3), in trials 6 to 10. After trial 10, in the
example of Figure 5, the four 256-sample frames are classified as: ACELP
for F0, then TCX256 for F1, then TCX512 for F2 and F3 grouped together.
A last trial (line 11) is then performed where all four 256-sample
frames (the whole super-frame) are encoded with 1024-sample TCX. Using
the segmental SNR criterion, again with 64-sample segments, this is
compared with the signal encoded using the mode selection in trial 10.
In this example, the final mode decision is 1024-sample TCX for the
whole frame. The mode bits for each 256-sample frame would then be (3,
3, 3, 3) as discussed in Table10.

### 5.2.4 ACELP/TCX open-loop mode selection

**The alternative method for ACELP/TCX mode selection is the low
complexity open-loop method. The open-loop mode selection is divided
into three selection stages: Excitation classification (EC), excitation
classification refinement (ECR) and TCX selection (TCXS). The mode
selection is done purely open-loop manner in EC and ECR. The usage of
TCXS algorithm depends on EC and ECR and it is closed loop TCX mode
selection.**

**1. stage**

The first stage excitation classification **is done before LP analysis.
The EC algorithm** is based on the frequency content of the input signal
using the VAD algorithm filter bank.

AMR-WB VAD produces signal energy ***E(n)*** in the 12 non-uniform bands
over the frequency range from 0 to Fs/4 kHz for every 256-sample frame.
Then energy levels of each band are normalised by dividing the energy
level ***E(n)*** from each band by the width of that band in Hz
producing normalised ***E~N~(n)*** energy levels of each band where n is
the band number from 0 to 11. Index 0 refers to the lowest sub band.

For each of the 12 bands, the standard deviation of the energy levels is
calculated using two windows: a short window ***std~short~(n)*** and a
long window ***std~long~(n)***. The length of the short and long window
is 4 and 16 frames, respectively. In these calculations, the 12 energy
levels from the current frame together with past 3 or 15 frames are used
to derive two ***stda~short~*** and ***stda~long~*** standard deviation
values. The standard deviation calculation is performed only when VAD
indicates active signal.

The relation between lower frequency bands and higher frequency bands
are calculated in each frame. The energy of lower frequency bands
***LevL*** from 1 to 7 are normalised by dividing it by the length of
these bands in Hz. The higher frequency bands 8 to 11 are normalised
respectively to create ***LevH***. Note that the lowest band 0 is not
used in these calculations because it usually contains so much energy
that it will distort the calculations and make the contributions from
other bands too small. From these measurements the relation ***LPH =
LevL / LevH*** is defined. In addition, for each frame a moving average
***LPHa*** is calculated using the current and 3 past ***LPH*** values.
The final measurement of the low and high frequency relation ***LPHaF***
for the current frame is calculated by using weighted sum of the current
and 7 past ***LPHa*** values by setting slightly more weighting for the
latest values.

The average level (***AVL***) in the current frame is calculated by
subtracting the estimated level of background noise from each filter
bank level after which the filter bank levels are normalised to balance
the high frequency bands containing relatively less energy than the
lower bands. In addition, total energy of the current frame,
***TotE~0,~*** is derived from all the filter banks subtracted by
background noise estimate of the each filter bank. Total energy of
previous frame is therefore ***TotE~-1~**.*

After calculating these measurements, a choice between ACELP and TCX
excitation is made by using the following pseudo-code:

> if (***stda~long~*** \< 0.4)

SET TCX\_MODE

> else if (LPHaF \> 280)

SET TCX\_MODE

> else if (***stda~long~*** \>= 0.4)
>
> if ((5+(1/( ***stda~long~*** -0.4))) \> LPHaF)

SET TCX\_MODE

> else if ((-90\* ***stda~long~*** +120) \< LPHaF)

SET ACELP\_MODE

> else

SET UNCERTAIN\_MODE

> if (ACELP\_MODE or UNCERTAIN\_MODE) and (***AVL*** \> 2000)

SET TCX\_MODE

> if (UNCERTAIN\_MODE)
>
> if (***stda~short~*** \< 0.2)

SET TCX\_MODE

> else if (***stda~short~*** \>= 0.2)
>
> if ((2.5+(1/( ***stda~short~*** -0.2))) \> LPHaF)

SET TCX\_MODE

> else if ((-90\* ***stda~short~*** +140) \< LPHaF)

SET ACELP\_MODE

> else

SET UNCERTAIN\_MODE

> if (UNCERTAIN\_MODE)
>
> if ((***TotE~0~*** / ***TotE~-1\ ~***)\>25)

SET ACELP\_MODE

> if (TCX\_MODE \|\| UNCERTAIN\_MODE))
>
> if (***AVL*** \> 2000 and ***TotE~0\ ~***\< 60)

SET ACELP\_MODE

**2. stage**

**ECR is done after open-loop LTP anlysis.**

If VAD flag is set and mode has been classified in EC algorithm as
uncertain mode (defined as TCX\_OR\_ACELP), the is mode is selected as
follows:

> if (***SD~n~*** \> 0.2)
>
> Mode = ACELP\_MODE;
>
> else
>
> if (***LagDif~buf~*** \< 2 )
>
> if (***Lag~n\ ~***== HIGH LIMIT or ***Lag~n~*** == LOW LIMIT){
>
> if (***Gain~n~***-***NormCorr~n~***\<0.1 and ***NormCorr~n~***\>0.9)
>
> Mode = ACELP\_MODE
>
> else
>
> Mode = TCX\_MODE
>
> else if (***Gain~n~***- ***NormCorr~n~*** \< 0.1 and ***NormCorr~n~***
> \> 0.88)
>
> Mode = ACELP\_MODE
>
> else if (***Gain~n~*** -- ***NormCorr~n~*** \> 0.2)
>
> Mode = TCX\_MODE
>
> else
>
> ***NoMtcx*** = ***NoMtcx*** +1
>
> if (***MaxEnergy~buf~*** \< 60 )
>
> if (***SD~n~*** \> 0.15)
>
> Mode = ACELP\_MODE;
>
> else
>
> ***NoMtcx*** = ***NoMtcx*** +1.

Where spectral distance, ***SD~n~***, of the frame *n* is calculated
from ISP parameters as follows:

![](media/image23.wmf){width="2.0694444444444446in"
height="0.4722222222222222in"},

where ISP~n~ is the ISP coefficients vector of the frame *n* and
ISP~n~(i) is *i*th element of it.

***LagDif~buf\ ~***is the buffer containing open loop lag values of
previous ten frames (256 samples).

***Lag~n~*** contains two open loop lag values of the current frame *n*.

***Gain~n~*** contains two LTP gain values of the current frame *n*.

***NormCorr~n~*** contains two normalised correlation values of the
current frame *n*.

***MaxEnergy~buf~*** is the maximum value of the buffer containing
energy values. The energy buffer contains last six values of current and
previous frames (256 samples).

***lph~n\ ~***indicates the spectral tilt.

If VAD flag is set and mode has been classified in EC algorithm as ACELP
mode, the mode decision is verified according to following algorithm
where mode can be switched to TCX mode.

> if (***LagDif~buf~*** \< 2)
>

>
> Mode = TCX\_MODE;
>
> if (***lph~n~*** \> 200 and ***SD~n~*** \< 0.1)
>
> Mode = TCX\_MODE

If VAD flag is set in current frame and VAD flag has set to zero at
least one of frames in previous super-frame and the mode has been
selected as TCX mode, the usage of TCX1024 is disabled (the flag
***NoMtcx*** is set).

> if (***vadFlag~old~*** == 0 and ***vadFlag*** == 1 and Mode ==
> TCX\_MODE))
>
> ***NoMtcx*** = ***NoMtcx*** +1

If VAD flag is set and mode has been classified as uncertain mode
(TCX\_OR\_ACELP) or TCX mode, the mode decision is verified according to
following algorithm.

> if (***Gain~n~*** - ***NormCorr~n~*** \< 0.006 and ***NormCorr~n~***

>
> Mode = TCX\_MODE;
>

>
> Mode = ACELP\_MODE;

> ***NoMtcx*** = ***NoMtcx*** +1

***vadFlag~old\ ~***is the VAD flag of the previous frame and
***vadFlag*** is the VAD flag of the current frame.

***NoMtcx*** is the flag indicating to avoid TCX transformation with
long frame length (1024 samples), if TCX coding model is selected.

***Mag*** is a discete Fourier transformed (DFT) spectral envelope
created from LP filter coefficients, ***Ap,*** of the current frame.
***DFTSum*** is the sum of first 40 elements of the vector ***mag*** ,
excluding the first element (***mag(0)***) of the vector ***mag***.

If VAD flag is set and the mode, ***Mode(Index)***, of the ***Index***th
frame of current superframe has still been classified as uncertain mode
(TCX\_OR\_ACELP), the mode is decided based on selected modes in the
previous and current superframes. The counter, ***TCXCount***, gives the
number of selected long TCX frames (TCX512 and TCX1024) in previous
superframe (1024 samples). The counter, ***ACELPCount***, gives the
number of ACELP frames (256 samples) in previous and current
superframes.

> if ((***prevMode(i)*** == TCX1024 or ***prevMode(i)*** == TCX512) and
> ***vadFlag~old~(i)***== 1 and ***TotE~i~*** \> 60)

>
> if (***Index*** != ***i***)
>
> if (***Mode(i)*** == ACELP\_MODE)
>
> ***ACELPCount*** = ***ACELPCount*** + 1

Where ***prevMode(i)*** is the ***i**th* frame (256 samples) in the
previous superframe, ***Mode(i)*** is the ***i**th* frame in the current
superframe. ***i*** is the frame (256 samples) number in superframe (1,
2, 3, 4), The mode, ***Mode(Index)***, is selected based on the counters
***TCXCount*** and ***ACELPCount*** as follows

> if (***TCXCount*** \> 3)

> ***Mode(Index)*** = TCX\_MODE;
>
> else if (***ACELPCount*** \> 1)
>
> ***Mode(Index)*** = ACELP\_MODE
>
> else
>
> ***Mode(Index)*** = TCX\_MODE

**3. stage: TCXS is done only if** the number of ACELP modes selected in
EC and ECR is less than three (ACELP\<3) within an 1024-sample
super-frame. The Table11 shows the possible mode combination which can
be selected in TCXS. TCX mode is selected according to segmental SNR
described in Chapter 5.2.3 (ACELP/TCX closed-loop mode selection).

5.3 Hybrid ACELP/TCX core encoding description 
----------------------------------------------

### 5.3.1 Pre-emphasis

The input (mono) signal to the core ACELP/TCX encoder is first
pre-processed through a high-pass filter. Then, a first-order, fixed
pre-emphasis filter is applied with transfer function:

![](media/image24.wmf){width="1.2222222222222223in" height="0.25in"}

This pre-emphasis filter reduces the signal energy at low frequency and
increases the signal energy at high frequency. The result is a signal
with a less spectral dynamics, which enhances the resolution of LPC
analysis. This is particularly important in fixed-point implementations.

### 5.3.2 LP analysis and interpolation

The principles are similar to 3GPP TS 26.190 (Section 5.2) except for
the window shape and position, and the interpolation factors.

LPC analysis is performed every 256 samples in the superframe. The
analysis window has 448 samples in duration, and has the shape of a
half-sine cycle. It is symmetrical, and centred, for each LP analysis,
at the middle of the first 64-sample sub-frame following each 256-sample
frame. Hence, the lookahead required for LP analysis is half the
analysis window length plus 32 samples, for a total of 256 samples.

The autocorrelations of windowed speech are converted to the LP
coefficients using the Levinson-Durbin algorithm. Then the LP
coefficients are transformed to the ISP domain for quantization and
interpolation purposes. The interpolated quantized and unquantized
filters are converted back to the LP filter coefficients (to construct
the synthesis and weighting filters at each subframe).

The LP coefficients are quantized in the ISF domain, and interpolated
every 64 samples. Depending on the coding mode selected (ACELP or TCX),
the LP coefficients are transmitted at different update rates. For
ACELP, which is based on the AMR-WB encoder, the LP coefficients are
transmitted every 256 samples. For TCX, the LPC coefficients are
transmitted every 256, 512 or 1024 samples, depending on the TCX frame
length.

The LPC analysis is identical for ACELP or TCX.

#### **5.3.2.1 Windowing and auto‑correlation computation**

A 448-sample symmetrical sine window is used. The window is given by

![](media/image25.wmf){width="1.625in" height="0.4722222222222222in"}
![](media/image26.wmf){width="0.8888888888888888in"
height="0.2222222222222222in"}

where *L*=488 is the window length.

Autocorrelation computation and lag windowing are similar to 3GPP TS
26.190 (Section 5.2.1) with the exception that the window length is 488
samples and centred at the middle of the first subframe of the next
256-sample frame.

#### **5.3.2.2 Levinson‑Durbin algorithm**

Same as 3GPP TS 26.190.

#### **5.3.2.3 LP to ISP conversion**

Same as 3GPP TS 26.190.

#### **5.3.2.4 ISP to LP conversion**

Same as 3GPP TS 26.190.

#### **5.3.2.5 Quantization of the ISP coefficient**

Same as 3GPP TS 26.190. The difference is that the in case of TCX, the
LP parameters are quantized and transmitted once per TCX frame (256,
512, or 1024 samples).

#### **5.3.2.6 Interpolation of the ISPs**

Since the LP analysis window shape and position is changed compared to
AMR-WB, the interpolation factors have changed.

The interpolation is performed on the ISPs in the
![](media/image27.wmf){width="0.18888888888888888in"
height="0.17777777777777778in"}domain (cosine domaine).
Let![](media/image28.wmf){width="0.2916666666666667in"
height="0.25in"}be the ISP vector from LP analysis at frame *n* (centred
at the 1^st^ subframe of the frame *n*+1), and
![](media/image29.wmf){width="0.375in" height="0.25in"} the ISP vector
from LP analysis at frame *n*-1 (centred at the 1^st^ subframe of the
frame n). The interpolated ISP vectors in each subframe are given by

![](media/image30.wmf){width="3.0555555555555554in"
height="0.4305555555555556in"}.

The interpolated ISP vectors are used to compute a different LP filter
at each subframe using the ISP to LP conversion method.

The interpolation is performed for both unquantized and quantized
parameters. In case TCX frames, the LP parameters are quantized once per
256-sample, 512-sample, or 1024-sample TCX frame, depending on the
selected TCX mode. Thus the interpolation of quantized ISPs is performed
as follows. In case of ACELP or 256-sample TCX frames, the interpolated
quantized parameters are given by

![](media/image31.wmf){width="3.0555555555555554in"
height="0.4305555555555556in"}.

In case of 512-sample TCX frames, comprised of 256-sample frames *n* and
*n*+1, the interpolated quantized parameters are given by

![](media/image32.wmf){width="3.3194444444444446in"
height="0.4305555555555556in"}.

In case of 1024-sample TCX frames, comprised of 256-sample frames *n*,
*n*+1, n+2, and n+3, the interpolated quantized parameters are given by

![](media/image33.wmf){width="3.5555555555555554in"
height="0.4305555555555556in"}.

### 5.3.3 Perceptual weighting

Same as 3GPP TS 26.190, using a filter of the form
![](media/image34.wmf){width="1.6111111111111112in"
height="0.2222222222222222in"}. Note that in case of TCX coding,
quantized filter coefficients are used at the numerator, so that the
filter is given by ![](media/image35.wmf){width="1.8611111111111112in"
height="0.2916666666666667in"}.

### 5.3.4 ACELP Excitation encoder

#### **5.3.4.1 Open‑loop pitch analysis**

Same as 3GPP TS 26.190 but with the minimum and maximum pitch lags as
functions of the internal sampling rate.

#### **5.3.4.2 Impulse response computation**

Same as 3GPP TS 26.190.

#### **5.3.4.3 Target signal computation**

Same as 3GPP TS 26.190

#### 5.3.4.4 Adaptive codebook

Same as 3GPP TS 26.190 but with the minimum and maximum pitch lags as
functions of the internal sampling rate.

#### **5.3.4.5 Algebraic codebook**

Same as 3GPP TS 26.190. The codebooks used in some basic core rates are
the same as used in AMR-WB at 12.65, 14.25, 15.85, 18.25, 19.85, and
23.05, respectively. The codebook used in mono rate 208 bits/frame is
the same as the one used in AMR-WB at 8.85 kbps (20 bit codebook). The
codebook used in mono rate 240 bits/frame is a 28 bit codebook where two
tracks contain one pulse each and two tracks contain two pulses each
according to the following table:

Table 12: Potential positions of individual pulses in the 28-bit
algebraic codebook

  ------- -------- --------------------------------------------------------------

  ------- -------- --------------------------------------------------------------

##### 5.3.4.5.1 Codebook structure

Same as 3GPP TS 26.190.

##### 5.3.4.5.2 Pulse indexing

Same as 3GPP TS 26.190.

##### 5.3.4.5.3 Codebook search

> Same as 3GPP TS 26.190.

#### **5.3.4.6 Quantization of the adaptive and fixed codebook gains**

The adaptive codebook gain (pitch gain) and the fixed (algebraic)
codebook gain are vector quantized using the same 7-bit codebook used in
AMR-WB for modes 2 to 8. However, instead of using MA prediction to
obtain the predicted gain *g*\'*~c~* , it is found by directly
quantizing the average innovation energy in the whole frame.

Let *E~s~*(*n*) be the innovation energy (in dB) at subframe *n*, and
given by

![](media/image36.wmf){width="3.3194444444444446in" height="0.5in"}

where *N*=64 is the subframe size, *c*(*i*) is the fixed codebook
excitation, and *E~i~* is the un-scaled innovation energy given by

![](media/image37.wmf){width="1.1111111111111112in"
height="0.4722222222222222in"}

An estimated innovation energy
![](media/image38.wmf){width="0.20833333333333334in"
height="0.2638888888888889in"} is computed and quantized, and used to
find the estimated gain *g*\'*~c~* . That is,

![](media/image39.wmf){width="1.0965277777777778in"
height="0.2777777777777778in"}

which is derived from the relation
![](media/image40.wmf){width="1.4583333333333333in"
height="0.2638888888888889in"}.

A correction factor between the gain *g~c~* and the estimated one
*g*\'*~c~* is given by

![](media/image41.wmf){width="0.8055555555555556in"
height="0.2638888888888889in"}

The pitch gain, *g~p~*, and correction factor γ are jointly vector
quantized using the same 7-bit codebook used in AMR-WB, and using the
same error minimization procedure. That is, the gain codebook search is
performed by minimizing the mean-square of the weighted error between
original and reconstructed signal.

The estimated innovation energy is computed and quantized as follows.
First, the LP residual energy is computed in each subframe *n* by

![](media/image42.wmf){width="2.111111111111111in" height="0.5in"}

then the average residual energy per subframe is found by

> ![](media/image43.wmf){width="1.2777777777777777in"
> height="0.4722222222222222in"}

The innovation energy is estimated from the residual energy by removing
an estimate of the adaptive codebook contribution. This is done by
removing an energy related to the average normalized correlation
obtained from the two open-loop pitch analyses performed in the frame.
That is

> ![](media/image44.wmf){width="1.0965277777777778in"
> height="0.2638888888888889in"}

where ![](media/image45.wmf){width="0.18055555555555555in"
height="0.20833333333333334in"} is the average of the normalized pitch
correlations obtain for each half-frame from the open-loop pitch
analysis.

The estimated innovation energy is quantized once per frame using 2
bits, with the quantization levels: 18, 30, 42, and 54. Further, the
quantized estimated innovation energy
![](media/image38.wmf){width="0.20833333333333334in"
height="0.2638888888888889in"} is constrained to be larger than
*E~max~*-37, where *E~max~* is the maximum value of *E~res~*(*n*) from
the 4 subframes. This is done by incrementing
![](media/image38.wmf){width="0.20833333333333334in"
height="0.2638888888888889in"} by 12 (and the quantization index by 1)
until ![](media/image46.wmf){width="1.0416666666666667in"
height="0.2638888888888889in"} or
![](media/image47.wmf){width="0.5694444444444444in"
height="0.2638888888888889in"}.

The quantized estimated innovation energy is then used to compute the
estimated gain in each subframe is explained above.

### 5.3.5 TCX Excitation encoder

This section presents the details of the TCX encoder, which is one of
the possible modes to encode the mono, low-frequency signal in the
0-Fs/4 kHz band. Section 5.3.5.1 first presents the block diagram of the
TCX encoder. Then, the details of each module are given in sections
5.3.5.2 to 5.3.5.13.

#### **5.3.5.1 TCX encoder block diagram**

Figure 6 shows a block diagram of the TCX encoding mode. The TCX
encoding principle is similar for TCX frames of 256, 512 and 1024
samples, with a few differences mostly involving the windowing and
filter interpolation. The input audio signal is first filtered through a
time-varying weighting filter (same perceptual filter as in AMR-WB) to
obtain a weighted signal ***x***. The weighting filter coefficients are
interpolated in the ISP domain as in Section 5.3.2.6. The interpolation
is linear, and the beginning and end of the interpolation depend on the
refresh rate of the LPC filter. The LPC filter is transmitted only once
per TCX frame. For longer frames (TCX512 and TCX1024) the interpolated
LPC filters will be farther apart that in the case of TCX256 or ACELP
frames.

Continuing in Figure 6, if the past frame was an ACELP frame, the
zero-input response (ZIR) of the weighting filter is removed from the
weighted signal, using the filter state at the end of the previous
(ACELP) frame. The signal is then windowed (the window shape will be
described in section 5.3.5.4) and a transform is applied to the windowed
signal. In the transform domain, the signal is first pre-shaped, to
minimize coding noise artefact in the low-frequencies, and then
quantized using a specific lattice quantizer. Specifically, an
8-dimensional multi-rate lattice quantizer is used, based on an
extension of the Gosset lattice.

After quantization, the inverse pre-shaping function is applied to the
spectrum which is then inverse transformed to provide a quantized
time-domain signal. The gain for that frame is then rescaled to optimize
the correlation with the original weighted signal. After gain rescaling,
a window is again applied to the quantized signal to minimize the block
effects due to quantizing in the transform domain. Overlap-and-add is
used with the previous frame if it was also in TCX mode. Finally, the
excitation signal is found through inverse filtering with proper filter
memory updating. This TCX excitation is in the same \"domain\" as the
ACELP (AMR-WB) excitation.

Figure 6: Principle of TCX encoding

Each module of Figure 6 will now be detailed in the following
subsections.

#### 5.3.5.2 Computation of the target signal for transform coding

To obtain the weighted signal, the input frame of audio samples is
filtered with a perceptual filter having the following transfer
function:

![](media/image49.wmf){width="1.3055555555555556in"
height="0.4583333333333333in"}

Here, ![](media/image50.wmf){width="0.3611111111111111in"
height="0.2638888888888889in"}is the quantized LP filter, interpolated
at every 64-sample sub-frame in the ISP domain as in Section 5.3.2.6,
and ![](media/image51.wmf){width="0.75in"
height="0.2638888888888889in"}is the weighted version of that filter.
The denominator of *W*(*z*) is a constant polynomial of order 1, which
is equal to the numerator of the pre-emphasis filter in Section 5.3.1.

#### 5.3.5.3 Zero-input response subtraction

If the previous encoded frame was ACELP, then the zero-input response
(ZIR) of the combination of the weighting filter and synthesis filter is
removed from the weighted signal. The ZIR is truncated to 128 samples
and windowed in such a way that its amplitude monotonically decreases to
zero at after 128 samples. The truncated ZIR is computed through the
following steps:

Using the filter states at the end of the previous frame, compute the
ZIR of the following transfer function over 2 consecutive subframes (128
samples duration):

![](media/image52.wmf){width="1.6666666666666667in" height="0.5in"}

where ![](media/image50.wmf){width="0.3611111111111111in"
height="0.2638888888888889in"}and ![](media/image51.wmf){width="0.75in"
height="0.2638888888888889in"} are as defined in Section 5.3.5.2.

Then, calling *z*(*n*) the truncated ZIR of *H*(*z*) (truncated to the
first 2*N* samples, where N=64 is the subframe length), compute
*z~w~*(*n*), the windowed ZIR such that it is always forced to zero at
the last sample:

*z~w~*(*n*) = *z*(*n*)\**w*(*n*) for *n* = 0 to 2*\*N*-1

where

*w*(*n*) = 1 for *n* = 0 to *N*-1

and *w*(*n*) = (2\**N*-*n*) / *N* for *n* = *N* to 2*\*N*-1

The shape of *w*(*n*) is shown in Figure 7 below, for a value of *N*=
64.

![](media/image53.wmf){width="4.789583333333334in" height="2.8875in"}

Figure 7: Shape of window to truncate the ZIR

After computing *z~w~*(*n*), it is removed from the first 2\**N* samples
of the weighted signal *x(n)*. This removal of the ZIR from the past
frame is performed only when the past frame was in ACELP mode.

#### 5.3.5.4 Windowing of target signal

In TCX mode, windowing in applied prior to the transform, and after the
inverse transform, in order to apply overlap-and-add to minimize the
framing effects due to quantization.

To smooth the transition between ACELP and TCX modes, proper care has to
be given to windowing and overlap of successive frames. Figure 8 shows
the window shapes depending on the TCX frame length and the type of the
previous frame (ACELP of TCX).

![](media/image54.png){width="6.104861111111111in"
height="7.063194444444444in"}

Figure 8: Target signal windowing in TCX coding

The window is defined as the concatenation of the following three
sub-windows:

*w*~1~(*n*) = sin(*2* π *n* / (4 *L*~1~) ) for *n* = 0, ..., *L*~1~-1

*w*~2~(*n*) = 1 for *n* = 0, \..., *L*- *L*~1~-1

*w*~3~(*n*) = sin(*2* π *n* / (4 *L*2) ) for *n* = *L*~2~, ...,
2*L*~2~-1

The constants *L*~1~, *L*~2~ and *L* are defined as follows.

*L*~1~ = 0 when the previous frame is a 256-sample ACELP frame

*L*~1~ = 32 when the previous frame is a 256-sample TCX frame

*L*~1~ = 64 when the previous frame is a 512-sample TCX frame

*L*~1~ = 128 when the previous frame is an 1024-sample TCX frame

Additionally:

**For 256**-sample **TCX**: *L* = 256 and *L*~2~ = 32

**For 512**-sample **TCX**: *L* = 512, and *L*~2~ = 64

**For 1024**-sample **TCX**: *L* = 1024, and *L*~2~ = 128 and

We note again that all these window types are applied to the weighted
signal, only when the present frame is a TCX frame. Frames of type ACELP
are encoded as in AMR-WB encoding (i.e. through analysis-by-synthesis
encoding of the excitation signal, so as to minimize the error in the
target signal -- the target signal is essentially the weighted signal
from which the zero-input response of the weighting filter is removed).

#### **5.3.5.5 Transform** 

After windowing, the signal is mapped to the frequency domain through a
Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT), defined as:

![](media/image55.wmf){width="2.138888888888889in"
height="0.5416666666666666in"}

where *L~TOT~* is the number of samples in the DFT. *L~TOT~* depends on
the frame length (256, 512 or 1024 samples, plus the lookahead which is
a function of the frame length).

An FFT is used to accelerate the computation of the Fourier
coefficients. A radix-9 FFT is used to adapt to the frame length which
is not a power of 2. Including the overlap in the windowing described in
Section 5.3.5.4, the number of samples at the input of the FFT is,
respectively, *L~TOT~* = 288 for 256-sample TCX frames (256 samples in
the frame plus 32 samples in the look-ahead), *L~TOT~* =576 for
512-sample TCX (512 samples in the frame plus 64 samples in the
lookahead), and *L~TOT~* =1152 samples for 1024-sample TCX (1024 samples
in the frame plus 128 samples in the lookahead).

#### 5.3.5.6 Spectrum pre-shaping

Once the Fourier spectrum (FFT) is computed, an adaptive low-frequency
emphasis module is applied to the spectrum, to minimize the perceived
distortion in the lower frequencies. The inverse low-frequency emphasis
will be applied at the decoder, as well as in the encoder to allow
obtaining the excitation signal necessary to encode the next frames. The
adaptive low-frequency emphasis is applied only on the first quarter of
the spectrum, as follows.

First, we call *X* the transformed signal at the output of the transform
(FFT) in Figure 6. The Fourier coefficient at Nyquist frequency is
systematically set to 0. Then, if *L~TOT~* is the number of samples in
the FFT (*L~TOT~* is thus the window length), the *K*= *L~TOT~* /2
complex-valued Fourier coefficients are grouped in blocks of four
consecutive coefficients, forming 8-dimensional real-valued blocks. This
block size of 8 is chosen to coincide with the 8-dimensional lattice
quantizer used for spectral quantization. The energy of each block is
computed, up to the first quarter of the spectrum. The energy *E~max~*
and position index *I* of the block with maximum energy are stored.
Then, we calculate a factor for each 8-dimensional block with position
index *m* smaller than *I*, as follows:

\- calculate the energy *E~m~* of the 8-dimensional block at position
index *m*

\- compute the ratio *R~m~* = *E~max~* / *E~m~*

\- compute the value (*R~m~*) ^¼^

\- if *R~m~* \> 10, then set *R~m~* = 10 (maximum gain of 20 dB)

\- also, if *R~m~* \> *R~m-1~* then *R~m~* = *R ~m-1~*

This last condition ensures that the ratio function *R~m~* decreases
monotonically. Further, limiting the ratio *R~m~* to be smaller or equal
to 10 means that no spectral components in the low-frequency emphasis
function will be modified by more than 20 dB.

After computing the ratio *R~m~* = (*E~max~* / *E~m~*) ^¼^ for all
blocks with position index smaller that *I* (and with the limiting
conditions described above), we then apply these ratios as a gain for
each corresponding block. This has the effect of increasing the energy
of blocks with relatively low energy compared to the block with maximum
energy *E~max~*. Applying this procedure prior to quantization has the
effect of shaping the coding noise in the lower band, such that low
energy components before the first spectral peak will be better encoded.

#### 5.3.5.7 Split multi-rate lattice VQ

To quantize the pre-shaped spectrum *X* of the weighted signal in TCX
mode, a method based on lattice quantizers is used. Specifically, the
spectrum is quantized in 8-dimensional blocks using vector codebooks
composed of subsets of the Gosset lattice, referred to as the *RE~8~*
lattice (see \[6\]). All points of a given lattice can be generated from
the so-called *generator matrix G* of the lattice, as *c* = *k* *G*,
where *k* is a line vector with integer values and *c* is the generated
lattice point. To form a vector codebook at a given rate, only lattice
points inside a sphere (in 8 dimensions) of a given radius are taken.
Multi-rate codebooks can thus be formed by taking subsets of different
radii.

In lattice quantization, the operation of finding the nearest neighbour
of an input vector *x* among all codebook points is reduced to a few
simple operations, involving rounding the components of a vector and
verifying a few constraints. Hence, no exhaustive search is carried out
as in stochastic quantization, which uses stored tables. Once the best
lattice codebook point is determined, further calculations are also
necessary to compute the binary index that will be sent to the decoder.
The larger the components of the input vector *x*, the more bits will be
required to encode the index of its nearest neighbour in the lattice
codebook. Hence, to remain within a pre-defined bit budget, a gain-shape
approach has to be used, where the input vector is first scaled down,
i.e. divided by a gain which has to be estimated, then quantized in the
lattice, then scaled up again to produce the quantization result. To
reduce computation complexity, the binary indices will actually only be
calculated if a given TCX mode is retained as the best mode for a frame.

For simplicity, we let *N* be the length of the DFT. Since the transform
used to obtain *X* is a Discrete Fourier Transform, there are *N*/2+1
Fourier coefficients including *X*(*N*/2) at Nyquist frequency. In the
quantization process, coefficient *X*(*N*/2) is always set to 0, so
there are exactly *N*/2 Fourier coefficients to quantize. Then, all
coefficients of *X* are complex, except *X*(0) which is real.

To be quantized using the *RE~8~* lattice codebooks, the pre-shaped
spectrum *X* is split into consecutive blocks of 8 real values (4
consecutive complex coefficients). There are *K*=*N*/8 such blocks in
the whole spectrum. We call *B~k~* the *k^th^* block, with *k* = 0, 1,
..., *K*-1. To remain within the total bit budget, the spectrum *X* will
have to be divided by a global gain *g* prior to quantization, and
multiplied by the quantized global gain after each block *B~k~* is
encoded using the *RE~8~* lattice. We call *X*\'=*X*/*g* the scaled
spectrum and *B\'~k~* = *B~k~* / *g* the *k^th^* scaled block. Thus, the
parameters sent to the decoder to encode the TCX spectrum *X* are the
global gain *g* and the index of the nearest neighbour of each block
*B~k~* within the lattice codebook.

The index of the nearest neighbour in the lattice is actually composed
of three parts: 1) a codebook index, which essentially represents the
bit allocation for each 8-dimensional vector; 2) a vector index, which
uniquely identifies a lattice vector in a so-called *base codebook C*;
and 3) an extention index *k*, which is used to extend the base codebook
when the selected point in the lattice is not in the base codebook *C*.
The extension used, called the *Voronoi* extension, will be described in
Step 5 below.

These parameters are encoded using the 5 Steps described below.

**Step 1** Find the energy *E~k~* of each block *B~k~*:

![](media/image56.wmf){width="1.9861111111111112in"
height="0.4722222222222222in"}

and obtain from *E~k~* a first estimate of the bit budget using the
starting assumption that the global gain *g* equals 1 (i.e. that the
spectrum *X* is quantized without scaling first):

![](media/image57.wmf){width="1.125in" height="0.3611111111111111in"}

The formula for *R~k~*(1) is based on the properties of the underlying
*RE~8~* lattice, and the method used for encoding the index of a lattice
point selected by the quantizer. These properties and encoding method
will be described in Steps 3 and 5.

Unless the energy of the frame is very small, the block energies *E~k~*
will be too large to ensure that the total bit consumption (sum of all
*R~k~*(1)) remains within the total bit budget for the frame. Hence, it
is necessary to estimate a gain *g* so that the quantization of
*X*\'=*X*/*g* in the *RE~8~* lattice will produce a set of indices that
stay within the bit budget. This gain estimation is performed in Step 2.

**Step 2** The estimation of the global gain *g* for the TCX frame is
performed in an iteration, as follows.

**Initialisation:** Set *fac* = 128, *offset* = 0 and *nbits\_max* =
0.95\*(NB\_BITS\_ - *K*)

**Iteration:** Do the following block of operations *NITER* times (here,
*NITER* = 10).

1- offset = offset + fac

2- ![](media/image58.wmf){width="1.9722222222222223in"
height="0.44375in"}

3- if nbits \<= nbits\_max, then offset = offset -- fac

fac = fac / 2

After the iteration, the global gain is estimated as

![](media/image59.wmf){width="1.4375in" height="0.48194444444444445in"}

The scaled spectrum can then be obtained as X\'=X/g. The input to the
lattice quantizer described in Step 3 are the scaled blocks B\'~k~ =
B~k~ / g, each an 8-dimensional vector of real components. The
assumption if that the total number of bits used to quantize B\'~k~ into
the lattice codebook will be close to the bit budget.

**Step 3** In this step, each 8-dimensional block *B\'~k~* of the scaled
spectrum *X*\'=*X*/*g* is rounded as a point in the *RE~8~* lattice, to
produce its quantized
version,![](media/image60.wmf){width="0.17708333333333334in"
height="0.17708333333333334in"}. Before looking at the quantization
procedure, it is worthwhile to look at the properties of this lattice.
*RE~8~* is defined as follows:

![](media/image61.wmf){width="1.7777777777777777in"
height="0.2361111111111111in"}

that is as the union of the 2*D*~8~ lattice and a version of 2*D*~8~
shifted by the vector (1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1). Therefore, searching for the
nearest neighbour in the lattice *RE~8~* is equivalent to searching for
the nearest neighbour in the lattice 2*D*~8~, then searching for the
nearest neighbour in the lattice 2*D*~8~ + (1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1), and
finally selecting the best of those two lattice points. The lattice
2*D*~8~ is just the *D*~8~ lattice scaled by a factor of 2, with the
*D*~8~ lattice defined as:

![](media/image62.wmf){width="3.986111111111111in"
height="0.2777777777777778in"}

That is, the lattice points in *D*~8~ are all integers, with the
constraint that the sum of all components is even. This also implies
that the sum of the components of a lattice point in 2*D*~8~ is an
integer multiple of 4.

From this definition of *RE~8~*, it is straightforward to develop a fast
algorithm to search for the nearest neighbour of an 8-dimensional block
*B\'~k~* among all lattice points in *RE~8~*. This is done by applying
the following operations. We note that the components of *B\'~k~* are
floating point values. The result of the quantization,
![](media/image63.wmf){width="0.23055555555555557in" height="0.25in"},
will be a vector of integers.

*1. z*~k~ = 0.5 \* *B\'~k~*

2\. Round each component of *z*~k~ to the nearest integer, to generate
![](media/image64.wmf){width="0.18055555555555555in"
height="0.20833333333333334in"}

*3. y*1~k~ = 2![](media/image64.wmf){width="0.18055555555555555in"
height="0.20833333333333334in"}

4\. calculate *S* as the sum of the components of *y*1~k~

5\. If *S* is not an integer multiple of 4 (negative values are
possible), then modify one of its components as follows:

\- find the position *I* where abs(*z*~k~(*i*)- *y*1~k~(*i*)) is the
highest

\- if *z*~k~(*I*)- *y*1~k~(*I*) \< 0, then *y*1~k~(*I*) = *y*1~k~(*I*) -
2

\- if *z*~k~(*I*)- *y*1~k~(*I*) \> 0, then *y*1~k~(*I*) = *y*1~k~(*I*) +
2

*6. z*~k~ = 0.5 \* (*B\'~k~* - **1.0**) where **1.0** denotes a vector
with all 1\'s

7\. Round each component of *z*~k~ to the nearest integer, to generate
![](media/image64.wmf){width="0.18055555555555555in"
height="0.20833333333333334in"}

*8. y*2~k~ = 2![](media/image64.wmf){width="0.18055555555555555in"
height="0.20833333333333334in"}

9\. calculate *S* as the sum of the components of *y*2~k~

10\. If *S* is not an integer multiple of 4 (negative values are
possible), then modify one of its components as follows:

\- find the position *I* where abs(*z*~k~(*i*)- *y*2~k~(*i*)) is the
highest

\- if *z*~k~(*I*)- *y*2~k~(*I*) \< 0, then *y*2~k~(*I*) = *y*2~k~(*I*) -
2

\- if *z*~k~(*I*)- *y*2~k~(*I*) \> 0, then *y*2~k~(*I*) = *y*2~k~(*I*) +
2

*11. y*2~k~ = *y*2~k~ + **1.0**

12\. Compute *e*1~k~ = (*B\'~k~* - *y*1~k~)^2^ and *e*2~k~ = (*B\'~k~* -
*y*2~k~)^2^

13\. If *e*1~k~ \> *e*2~k~, then the best lattice point (nearest
neighbour in the lattice) is *y*1~k~

otherwise the best lattice point is *y*2~k~ .

This is noted as ![](media/image65.wmf){width="0.4722222222222222in"
height="0.2361111111111111in"}where *c~k~* is the best lattice point as
selected above.

Through this quantization procedure, the scaling gain *g*, estimated in
Step 2, is left unquantized. The gain will be quantized only after being
recomputed as in Section 5.3.5.10, to obtain
![](media/image66.wmf){width="0.1527777777777778in"
height="0.2222222222222222in"}. The quantized spectrum will then be
obtained as ![](media/image67.wmf){width="0.625in" height="0.25in"}.

We note that after this lattice quantization step, the indices of the
selected lattice points are not known. The indices will only be computed
if a particular TCX mode is selected instead of an ACELP mode. (See Step
5 for the lattice index computation)

**Step 4** A last step in the quantization procedure is the
determination and quantization of a comfort noise factor. Comfort noise
enhances the perceived quality in transform-based coders, which is the
case for the TCX modes. Comfort noise will be added only to unquantized
spectral components in the upper-half of the spectrum (Fs/8 kHz and
above). Taking again *K* as the total number of 8-dimensional blocks in
the spectrum, the comfort noise factor is calculated as follows:

**Initialisation:** Set *nbits* = 0, *n* = 1 and take the *offset* value
at the end of the iteration in Step 2 above.

**Iteration** : For *k* = *K* / 2 to *K*-1, do

*1 tmp* = *R~k~*(1) - *offset* ( with *R~k~*(1) as calculated in Step 1)

2\. if (*tmp* \< 5), then *nbits = nbits + tmp* and *n = n +* 1

**Noise factor calculation:**

Set *nbits* = *nbits*/ *n*, and evaluate the noise factor as

![](media/image68.wmf){width="2.138888888888889in" height="0.375in"}

The noise factor will be comprised between 0 and 1.

**Noise level quantization**

The comfort noise factor is quantized using 3 bits in the range from 0.8
to 1.0.

**Step 5** In Step 3, each scaled block *B\'~k~* was rounded as a point
in the *RE~8~* lattice. The result is
![](media/image69.wmf){width="0.5833333333333334in"
height="0.2777777777777778in"}, the quantized version of *B\'~k~*. If
the corresponding TCX mode is actually retained as the best encoding
mode for that frame (in open-loop fashion as in Section 5.2.4 or in
closed-loop fashion as in Section 5.2.3), then an index has to be
computed for each ![](media/image70.wmf){width="0.18055555555555555in"
height="0.25in"}for transmission to the decoder. The computation of
these indices is described in this final Step.

The calculation of an index for a given point in the *RE~8~* lattice is
based on two basic principles:

1- All points in the lattice *RE~8~* lie on concentric spheres of radius
![](media/image71.wmf){width="0.32222222222222224in"
height="0.22083333333333333in"}with *m* = 0, 1, 2, 3, etc., and each
lattice point on a given sphere can be generated by permuting the
coordinates of reference points called *leaders.* There are very few
leaders on a sphere, compared to the total number of lattice points
which lie on the sphere. Codebooks of different bit rates can be
constructed by including only spheres up to a given number *m*. See
reference \[6\] for more details, where codebooks *Q*~0~, *Q*~1~,
*Q*~2~, *Q*~3~, *Q*~4~, and *Q*~5~ are constructed with respectively 0,
4, 8, 12, 16 and 20 bits. Hence, codebook *Q~n~* requires 4*n* bits to
index any point in that codebook.

2- From a base codebook *C* (i.e. a codebook containing all lattice
points from a given set of spheres up to a number *m*), an extended
codebook can be generated by multiplying the elements of *C* by a factor
*M*, and adding a second-stage codebook called the *Voronoi extension*.
This construction is given by *y* = *M z* + *v*, where *M* is the scale
factor, *z* is a point in the base codebook and *v* is the Voronoi
extension. The extension is computed in such a way that any point *y* =
*M z* + *v* is also a lattice point in *RE~8~*. The extended codebook
includes lattice points that extend further out from the origin than the
base codebook.

The base codebook C in the present TCX modes can be either codebook
*Q*~0~, *Q*~2~, *Q*~3~ or *Q*~4~ from reference \[6\]. When a given
lattice point ![](media/image72.wmf){width="0.18055555555555555in"
height="0.20833333333333334in"}is not included in these base codebooks,
the Voronoi extension is applied, using this time only the *Q*~3~ or
*Q*~4~ part of the base codebook. Note that here, *Q*~2~
![](media/image73.wmf){width="0.16666666666666666in"
height="0.1388888888888889in"} *Q*~3~ but *Q*~3~
![](media/image74.wmf){width="0.16666666666666666in"
height="0.16666666666666666in"} *Q*~4~.

Then, the calculation of the index for each lattice point
![](media/image72.wmf){width="0.18055555555555555in"
height="0.20833333333333334in"} (quantization result in Step 3) is done
according to the following operations.

**Verify if** ![](media/image72.wmf){width="0.18055555555555555in"
height="0.20833333333333334in"} **is in the base codebook *C*.** Here,
this implies verifying if
![](media/image70.wmf){width="0.18055555555555555in" height="0.25in"}is
an element of *Q*~0~, *Q*~2~, *Q*~3~ or *Q*~4~ from \[6\]. If *y* is in
*C,* the index used to encode
![](media/image70.wmf){width="0.18055555555555555in" height="0.25in"} is
thus the codebook number ![](media/image75.wmf){width="0.19375in"
height="0.25in"}plus the index *I~k~* of codevector
![](media/image70.wmf){width="0.18055555555555555in" height="0.25in"} in
![](media/image76.wmf){width="0.2916666666666667in" height="0.25in"}.
The codebook number ![](media/image75.wmf){width="0.19375in"
height="0.25in"}is encoded as a unary code, as follows:

Q~0~ → unary code for![](media/image75.wmf){width="0.19375in"
height="0.25in"}is 0

Q~2~ → unary code for ![](media/image75.wmf){width="0.19375in"
height="0.25in"}is 10

Q~3~ → unary code for ![](media/image75.wmf){width="0.19375in"
height="0.25in"}is 110

Q~4~ → unary code for ![](media/image75.wmf){width="0.19375in"
height="0.25in"}is 1110

The terminating \"0\" in this unary code will indicate to the decoder
the separation between the successive blocks
![](media/image70.wmf){width="0.18055555555555555in" height="0.25in"} in
the bit stream.

The index *I~k~* indicates the rank of
![](media/image70.wmf){width="0.18055555555555555in" height="0.25in"},
i.e. the permutation to be applied to a specific leader to obtain
![](media/image70.wmf){width="0.18055555555555555in" height="0.25in"}
(see \[6\]). Note that if ![](media/image75.wmf){width="0.19375in"
height="0.25in"}= 0, then *I~k~* uses no bits. Otherwise, the index
*I~k~* uses 4![](media/image75.wmf){width="0.19375in"
height="0.25in"}bits. Hence, a total of
5![](media/image75.wmf){width="0.19375in" height="0.25in"}bits are
required to index any lattice point in the base codebook:
![](media/image75.wmf){width="0.19375in" height="0.25in"}bits for the
unary code specifying the codebook number (with the exception that 1 bit
is required for Q~0~), and 4![](media/image75.wmf){width="0.19375in"
height="0.25in"} bits to index the lattice point
![](media/image72.wmf){width="0.18055555555555555in"
height="0.20833333333333334in"}in that codebook.

If ![](media/image72.wmf){width="0.18055555555555555in"
height="0.20833333333333334in"}is not in the base codebook, then apply
the Voronoi extension through the following sub-steps, using this time
only *Q*~3~ or *Q*~4~ as the base codebook.

**V0** Set the extension order *r* = 1 and the scale factor *M* = 2*^r^*
= 2.

**V1** Compute the Voronoi index *k* of the lattice point
![](media/image70.wmf){width="0.18055555555555555in" height="0.25in"}.
The Voronoi index *k* depends on the extension order *r* and the scale
factor *M*. The Voronoi index is computed via modulo operations such
that *k* depends only on the relative position of
![](media/image70.wmf){width="0.18055555555555555in" height="0.25in"} in
a scaled and translated Voronoi region:

![](media/image77.wmf){width="1.2777777777777777in"
height="0.2777777777777778in"}

Here,![](media/image78.wmf){width="0.18055555555555555in"
height="0.19375in"}is the generator matrix and mod*~m~*(*·*) is the
component-wise modulo-*M* operation. Hence, the Voronoi index *k* is a
vector of integers with each component comprised in the interval 0 to
*M*-- 1.

**V2** Compute the Voronoi codevector *v* from the Voronoi index *k*.
This can be implemented using an algorithm described in \[7\].

**V3** Compute the difference vector *w* =
![](media/image70.wmf){width="0.18055555555555555in" height="0.25in"} --
*v*. This difference vector *w* always belongs to the scaled lattice
*mΛ*, where *Λ is the lattice RE~8~*. Compute *z* = *w*/*M*, i.e., apply
the inverse scaling to the difference vector *w*. The codevector *z*
belongs to the lattice *Λ, *since *w* belongs to *MΛ*.

**V4** Verify if *z* is in the base codebook *C (i.e. in Q*~3~ or
*Q*~4~*)*

If *z* is not in *C*, increment the extension order *r* by 1, multiply
the scale factor *M* by 2, and go back to sub-step V1.

Otherwise, if *z* is in *C*, then we have found an extension order *r*
and a scaling factor *M* = 2*^r^* sufficiently large to encode the index
of ![](media/image70.wmf){width="0.18055555555555555in"
height="0.25in"}. The index is formed of three parts: 1) the codebook
index *n~k~* as a unary code defined below; 2) the rank *I~k~* of *z* in
the corresponding base codebook (either *Q*~3~ or *Q*~4~); and 3) the 8
indices of the Voronoi index vector *k* calculated in sub-step V1, where
each index requires exactly *r* bits (*r* is the Voronoi extension order
set in sub-step V0).

The codebook index *n~k~* is encoded in unary code as follows:

*n~k~* = 11110 when the base codebook is *Q*~3~

and the Voronoi extension order is *r* = 1

*n~k~* = 111110 when the base codebook is *Q*~4~

and the Voronoi extension order is *r* = 1

*n~k~* = 1111110 when the base codebook is *Q*~3~

and the Voronoi extension order is *r* = 2

*n~k~* = 11111110 when the base codebook is *Q*~5~

and the Voronoi extension order is *r* = 2

*etc.*

The lattice point ![](media/image70.wmf){width="0.18055555555555555in"
height="0.25in"} is then described as

![](media/image70.wmf){width="0.18055555555555555in" height="0.25in"} =
*M* *z* + *v*

*The packetisation of these indices into transmission packets will be
described in Section 5.6.1.*

#### **5.3.5.8 Spectrum de-shaping**

Spectrum de-shaping is applied to the quantized spectrum prior to
applying the inverse FFT. The de-shaping is done according to the
following steps:

\- calculate the energy *E~m~* of the 8-dimensional block at position
index *m*

\- compute the ratio *R~m~* = *E~max~* / *E~m~*

\- compute the value (*R~m~*) ^½^

\- if *R~m~* \> 10, then set *R~m~* = 10 (maximum gain of 20 dB)

\- also, if *R~m~* \> *R~m-1~* then *R~m~* = *R ~m-1~*

After computing the ratio *R~m~* = (*E~max~* / *E ~m~*) ^½^ for all
blocks with position index smaller that *I* (and with the limiting
conditions described above), we then divide each block by the
corresponding ratio. Note that if we neglect the effects of
quantization, this de-shaping is the inverse of the pre-shaping function
as applied in Section 5.3.5.6.

#### 5.3.5.9 Inverse transform

The quantized spectrum
![](media/image79.wmf){width="0.4027777777777778in" height="0.25in"}is
inverse transformed to obtain the time-domain quantized signal
![](media/image80.wmf){width="0.34652777777777777in"
height="0.2222222222222222in"}. The Inverse DFT is applied, as defined
by:

![](media/image81.wmf){width="1.6805555555555556in"
height="0.5277777777777778in"}

where *L~TOT~* is the number of samples in the TCX frame, as defined in
Section 5.3.5.5. An Inverse FFT is used to optimize the computation time
of the inverse DFT.

#### 5.3.5.10 Gain optimization and quantization

The global gain estimated in Section 5.3.5.7 to scale the spectrum prior
to the multi-rate lattice quantization is not guaranteed to maximize the
correlation between the original weighted signal *x* and the quantized
weighted signal ![](media/image82.wmf){width="0.1388888888888889in"
height="0.19375in"}. Thus, after the inverse transform of the quantized
spectrum (Section 5.3.5.9), the optimal gain between *x* and
![](media/image83.wmf){width="0.1388888888888889in" height="0.19375in"}
is computed as follows:

![](media/image84.wmf){width="1.2777777777777777in" height="0.94375in"}

with *L~TOT~* as defined previously. Then, the gain *g\** is quantized
on a logarithmic scale to a 7-bit index, using the following procedure.
The procedure is purely algebraic and does not require storing a gain
codebook.

1\. Calculate the energy of the quantized weighted
signal:![](media/image85.wmf){width="0.125in"
height="0.2361111111111111in"}![](media/image86.wmf){width="0.9861111111111112in"
height="0.4861111111111111in"}

2\. Compute the RMS value:
![](media/image87.wmf){width="1.0277777777777777in"
height="0.5277777777777778in"} (known also at the decoder)

3\. Set *G* = *g\** x *rms* (normalization step)

4\. Calculate the index as
![](media/image88.wmf){width="1.8333333333333333in" height="0.25in"}
where ![](media/image89.wmf){width="0.2638888888888889in"
height="0.25in"} denotes removing the fractional part of *x* (rounding
towards 0).

5\. If *index* \< 0, then set *index* =0, and if *index* \>127, then set
*index* = 127.

The quantized gain ![](media/image90.wmf){width="0.25in"
height="0.2222222222222222in"}can be calculated as follows, both as the
encoder and decoder since the decoder can calculate locally the value of
*rms*:

![](media/image91.wmf){width="0.875in" height="0.375in"}

#### 5.3.5.11 Windowing for overlap-and-add

After gain scaling, the quantized weighted signal is windowed again,
according to the TCX frame length and the mode of the previous frame.
The window shapes are as shown in Figure 8 and defined in Section
5.3.5.4.

To reconstruct the complete quantized weighted signal, overlap-and-add
is applied between the memory of the past frame and the beginning of the
present frame corresponding to the non-flat portion of the window.
Recall that if the past frame was in ACELP mode, the memory of the past
frame corresponds to the windowed, truncated ZIR of the perceptual
filter, as calculated in Section 5.3.5.3.

#### **5.3.5.12 Memory update** 

The samples in the lookahead (windowed portion to the right of the TCX
frames in Figure 8) are kept in memory for the overlap-and-app procedure
in the next TCX frame.

#### **5.3.5.13 Excitation signal computation**

The excitation signal is finally computed by filtering the quantized
weighted signal through the inverse weighting filter with zero-memory.
The excitation is needed at the encoder in particular to update the
long-term predictor memory.

5.4 Mono Signal High-Band encoding (BWE)
----------------------------------------

The encoding of the HF signal is detailed in Figure 9. The HF signal is
composed of the frequency components above Fs/4 kHz in the input signal.
The bandwidth of this HF signal depends on the input signal sampling
rate. To encode the HF signal at a low rate, a bandwidth extension (BWE)
approach is employed. In BWE, energy information is sent to the decoder
in the form of spectral envelope and frame energy, but the fine
structure of the signal is extrapolated at the decoder from the received
(decoded) excitation signal in the LF signal.

The down-sampled HF signal is called *s~HF~*(*n*) in Figure 9. The
spectrum of this signal can be seen as a folded version of the
high-frequency band prior to down-sampling. An LP analysis is performed
on *s~HF~*(*n*) to obtain a set of coefficients which model the spectral
envelope of this signal. Typically, fewer parameters are necessary than
in the LF signal. Here, a filter of order 8 is used. The LP coefficients
are then transformed into ISP representation and quantized for
transmission. The number of LP analysis in an 1024-sample super-frame
depends on the frame lengths in the super-frame.

![](media/image92.wmf){width="6.690972222222222in"
height="2.932638888888889in"}

Figure 9: High frequency encoding

The LP filter for the HF signal is denoted by *A~HF~*(*z*), and its
quantized version is denoted by
![](media/image93.wmf){width="0.16666666666666666in"
height="0.2222222222222222in"}*~HF~* (*z*). From the LF signal (*s*(*n*)
in Figure 9), a residual signal is first obtained by filtering *s*(*n*)
through the inverse filter
![](media/image94.wmf){width="0.16666666666666666in"
height="0.2222222222222222in"}(*z*). Then, this residual is filtered
through the quantized HF synthesis filter,
1/![](media/image93.wmf){width="0.16666666666666666in"
height="0.2222222222222222in"}*~HF~* (*z*). Up to a gain factor, this
produces a good approximation of the HF signal, but in a spectrally
folded version. The actual HF synthesis signal will be recovered when
up-sampling is applied to this signal

Since the excitation is taken from the LF signal, an important step is
to compute the proper gain for the HF signal. This is done by comparing
the energy of the reference HF signal (*s~HF~*(*n*)) with the energy of
the synthesized HF signal. The energy is computed once per 64-sample
subframe, with energy match ensured at the Fs/4 kHz subband boundary.
Specifically, the synthesized HF signal and the reference HF signal are
filtered through a perceptual filter derived from *A~HF~*(*z*). The
ratio of the energy of these two filtered signals is computed every 64
samples, and expressed in dB. There are 4 such gains in a 256-sample
frame (one for every 64-sample subframe). This 4-gain vector represents
the gain that should be applied to the HF signal to properly match the
HF signal energy. Instead of transmitting this gain directly, an
estimated gain ratio is first computed by comparing the gains of filters
![](media/image94.wmf){width="0.16666666666666666in"
height="0.2222222222222222in"}(*z*) from the lower band and
![](media/image93.wmf){width="0.16666666666666666in"
height="0.2222222222222222in"}*~HF~* (*z*) from the higher band. This
gain ratio estimation is detailed in Figure 10 and will be explained
below. The gain ratio estimation is interpolated every 64 samples,
expressed in dB and subtracted from the measured gain ratio. The
resulting gain differences or gain corrections, noted
![](media/image95.wmf){width="0.19375in" height="0.25in"} to
![](media/image96.wmf){width="0.34652777777777777in" height="0.25in"} in
Figure 9, are quantized as 4-dimensional vectors, i.e. 4 values per
256-sample frame.

The gain estimation computed from filters
![](media/image94.wmf){width="0.16666666666666666in"
height="0.2222222222222222in"}(*z*) and
![](media/image93.wmf){width="0.16666666666666666in"
height="0.2222222222222222in"}*~HF~* (*z*) is detailed in Figure 12.
These two filters are available at the decoder side. The first 64
samples of a decaying sinusoid at Nyquist frequency *π* radians per
sample is first computed by filtering a unit impulse through a one-pole
filter. The Nyquist frequency is used since the goal is to match the
filter gains at around Fs/4 kHz, i.e. at the junction frequency between
the LF and HF signals. Note the 64-sample length of this reference
signal is the sub-frame length (64 samples). The decaying sinusoid is
then filtered first through
![](media/image94.wmf){width="0.16666666666666666in"
height="0.2222222222222222in"}(*z*), to obtain a low-frequency residual,
then through 1/![](media/image93.wmf){width="0.16666666666666666in"
height="0.2222222222222222in"}*~HF~* (*z*) to obtain a synthesis signal
from the HF synthesis filter. We note that if filters
![](media/image94.wmf){width="0.16666666666666666in"
height="0.2222222222222222in"}(*z*) and
![](media/image93.wmf){width="0.16666666666666666in"
height="0.2222222222222222in"}*~HF~* (*z*) have identical gains at the
normalized frequency of *π* radians per sample, the energy of the output
of 1/![](media/image93.wmf){width="0.16666666666666666in"
height="0.2222222222222222in"}*~HF~* (*z*) would be equivalent to the
energy of the input of
![](media/image94.wmf){width="0.16666666666666666in"
height="0.2222222222222222in"}(*z*) (the decaying sinusoid). If the
gains differ, then this gain difference is taken into account in the
energy of the signal at the output, noted *x*(*n*). The correction gain
should actually increased as the energy of *x*(*n*) decreases. Hence,
the gain correction is computed as the multiplicative inverse of the
energy of signal *x*(*n*), in the logarithmic domain (i.e. in dB). To
get a true energy ratio, the energy of the decaying sinusoid, in dB,
should be removed from the output. However, since this energy offset is
a constant, it will simply be taken into account in the gain correction
encoder.

At the decoder, the gain of the HF signal can be recovered by adding
![](media/image97.wmf){width="0.20833333333333334in" height="0.25in"} to
![](media/image98.wmf){width="0.34652777777777777in" height="0.25in"}
(known at the decoder) to the decoded gain corrections.

5.5 Stereo signal encoding
--------------------------

### 5.5.1 Stereo Signal Low-Band Encoding

![](media/image100.wmf){width="4.679166666666666in"
height="8.771527777777777in"}

#### 5.5.1.1 Principle

The stereo Low band encoder receives the signals
![](media/image101.wmf){width="0.5416666666666666in" height="0.25in"}
and ![](media/image15.wmf){width="0.5138888888888888in" height="0.25in"}
for encoding. The Low band encoder is based on fidelity optimized
encoding of the low band side signal. The Lo side signal is obtained by
computing the difference

![](media/image102.wmf){width="1.7916666666666667in" height="0.25in"},

The encoding of the side signal is performed following a similar
approach to that of the core encoder, except that the ACELP mode is not
used. For each input signal block, the encoder decides in closed loop
which encoding models to use. A signal to noise ratio fidelity criterion
is used.

All 4 encoding models are based on encoding in the frequency domain a
redundancy reduced side signal. In order to account for transients,
there is an encoding model that uses pre-echo reduction. Encoding in the
frequency domain uses the same split multi-rate lattice VQ.

Within each super-frame, the different encoding modes are:

  ------ ----------------------------- ----------------------
  mode   Duration (length + overlap)   Encoding
  0      40 + 8                        RR + Pre-echo + AVEQ
  1      40 + 8                        RR + AVEQ
  2      80 + 16                       RR + AVEQ
  3      160 + 32                      RR + AVEQ
  ------ ----------------------------- ----------------------

The timing chart as well as the possible mode combinations is similar to
that of the core encoder and is described in the following figure:

![](media/image103.wmf){width="5.293055555555555in"
height="3.890972222222222in"}

Selection of the encoding mode is done by closed loop search identical
to the one used for the core encoder.

#### 5.5.1.2 Signal Windowing

The two signals ![](media/image104.wmf){width="0.5in" height="0.25in"}
and ![](media/image101.wmf){width="0.5416666666666666in"
height="0.25in"} are windowed prior to redundancy removal and frequency
transformation. This is necessary in order to apply overlap-add to
minimize the framing effects due to quantization. The window shape is
adaptive depending on the previous coding mode and is similar to that
described in section 5.3.5.4. The windowed signals are denoted by
![](media/image105.wmf){width="0.5138888888888888in" height="0.25in"}
and ![](media/image106.wmf){width="0.5416666666666666in"
height="0.25in"}.

#### 5.5.1.3 Pre-echo mode

In order to encode transients more efficiently, a pre-echo mode is used.
It is often the case in transients that the energy envelope of the mono
signal is highly correlated with that of the side signal. The energy
envelope of the mono signal is derived and normalized, it is then used
to compensate for the energy envelope of the side signal.

#### 5.5.1.4 Redundancy reduction

For all encoding modes, a balance factor is used in order to remove the
portion of the side signal that is correlated with the mono signal. The
balance factor is given by

![](media/image107.wmf){width="2.486111111111111in"
height="0.7222222222222222in"}

the balance factor is quantized by a uniform scalar quantizer with 7
bits.

### 5.5.2 Stereo Signal Mid-Band Processing

#### 5.5.2.1 Principle

The encoder takes the mid band mono and right channel signals,
![](media/image16.wmf){width="0.5965277777777778in" height="0.25in"} and
![](media/image17.wmf){width="0.5833333333333334in" height="0.25in"},
and inverse filters it with the core codec LPC filters derived from the
mono signal. In the residual domain a shape constrained FIR filter is
computed for approximating the side signal. The filter is computed by
means of the covariance method using a novel spectral shape constraint.
A new filter is computed for each *Ldiv*=256 sample frame with an
analysis frame of 320 samples. The energy of the filter is smoothed to
avoid sudden energy changes.The smoothed filter is quantized with a
multistage predictive vector quantizer (MSPVQ).

The mono residual signal
![](media/image108.wmf){width="0.5965277777777778in" height="0.25in"}is
filtered with the quantized filter and gain factors are computed for the
left and right channels respectively.

![](media/image109.wmf){width="6.688194444444444in"
height="2.2784722222222222in"}

#### 5.5.2.2 Residual computation

The residual signal is computed according to

![](media/image110.wmf){width="3.513888888888889in"
height="0.4722222222222222in"}

![](media/image111.wmf){width="3.388888888888889in"
height="0.4722222222222222in"}

The quantized and interpolated LPC coefficients from the core codec are
used in the inverse filter operation, in addition an extra subframe is
computed for the overlapped analysis section. The residual side signal
is computed as

![](media/image112.wmf){width="3.3055555555555554in"
height="0.2638888888888889in"}

#### 5.5.2.3 Filter computation, smoothing and quantization

The filter is computed that minimizes the expression
![](media/image113.wmf){width="2.486111111111111in"
height="0.5277777777777778in"}under the constraint of a spectral null at
0Hz. The filter coefficients for the filter are computed with the well
know covariance method using a modified cholesky algorithm taking into
account the shape constraint.

To avoid to fast changes in the filter energy, the filter energy is
smoothed over time. The filter energy is first computed as

![](media/image114.wmf){width="0.8055555555555556in"
height="0.4722222222222222in"}

the new filter energy is computed such that the filter energy is
saturated to 16 and that transitions between frames are limited within a
+/- 1.5 dB interval.

After the smoothing operation the filter coefficients are quantized
using a predictive multistage vector quantizer.

In the stereo case two bandwith extensions are used. Both use the mono
coder excitation as excitation source.

5.6 Packetization
-----------------

### 5.6.1 Packetization of TCX encoded parameters

This section explains how the TCX encoded parameters are put in one or
several binary packets for transmission. One packet is used for
256-sample TCX, while respectively 2 and 4 packets are used for 512- and
1024-sample TCX. To split the TCX spectral information in multiple
packets (in case of 512- and 1024-sample TCX), the spectrum is divided
into interleaved *tracks*, where each track contains a subset of the
splits in the spectrum (each split represent 8-dimensional vectors
encoded with algebraic VQ, and the bits of individual splits are not
divided across different tracks). If we number the splits in the
spectrum, from low to high frequency, with the split numbers 0, 1, 2, 3,
etc. up to the last split at the highest frequency, then the tracks are
as shown in the following table

Table 13: Dividing spectral splits in different tracks for packetization

                    Split numbers   
  256-sample- TCX   Track 1         0, 1, 2, 3, etc (only one track)
  512-sample TCX    Track 1         0, 2, 4, 6, etc.
                    Track 2         1, 3, 5, 7, etc.
  1024-sampleTCX    Track 1         0, 4, 8, 12, etc.
                    Track 2         1, 5, 9, 13, etc.
                    Track 3         2, 6, 10, 14, etc.
                    Track 4         3, 7, 11, 15, etc.
  ----------------- --------------- ----------------------------------

Then, recall that the parameters of each split in algebraic VQ consist
of the codebook numbers **n** = \[*n~0~* \... *n~K-1~*\] and the indices
**i** = \[*i~0~* \... *i~K-1~*\] of all splits. The values of codebooks
numbers **n** are in the set of integers {0, 2, 3, 4,...}. The size
(number of bits) of each index *i~k~* is given by 4*n~k~*. To write
these bits into the different packets, we associate a track number to
each packet. In the case of 256-sample TCX, only one track is used (i.e.
all the splits in the spectrum) and it is written in a single packet. In
the case of 512-sample TCX, two packets are used: the first packet is
used for Track 1 and the second packet for Track 2. In the case of
1024-sample TCX, four packets are used: the first packet is used for
Track 1, the second packet for Track 2, the third packet for Track 3 and
the fourth packet for Track 4. However, the spectrum quantization and
bit allocation was performed without constraining each track to have the
same amount of bits, so in general the different tracks do not have the
same number of bits allocated to the respective splits. Hence, when
writing the encoded splits (codebook numbers and lattice point indices)
of a track into their respective packet, two situations can occur: 1)
there are not enough bits in the track to fill the packet or 2) there
are more bits in a track than the size of the packet so there is
overflow. The third possibility (exactly the same number of bits in a
track as the packet size) occurs rarely. This overflow has to be managed
properly, so all packets are completely filled, and so the decoder can
properly interpret and decode the received bits. This overflow
management will be explained below when the multiplexing for the case of
multiple binary tables (i.e. tracks) is detailed.

The split indices are written in their respective packets starting from
the lowest frequency split and scanning the track in the spectrum in
increasing value of frequency. The codebook number *n~K~* and index
*i~K~* of each split are written in separate sections of the packet.
Specifically, the bits of the codebook number *n~K~* (actually, its
unary code representation) are written sequentially starting from one
end of the packet, and the bits of the index *i~K~* are written
sequentially starting from the other end of the packet. Hence, overflow
occurs when these concurrent bit writing processes attempt to overwrite
each other. Alternatively, when the bits in one track do not completely
fill a packet, there will be a \"hole\" (i.e. available position for
writing more bits) somewhere in the middle of the packet. In 512-sample
TCX, overflow will only occur in one of the two packets, while the other
packet will have this \"hole\" where the overflowing bits of the other
packet will be written. In 1024-sample TCX, there can be \"holes\" in
more than one of the four packets after overflow has happened. In this
case, all the \"holes\" will be grouped together and the overflowing
bits of the other packets will be written into these \"holes\". Details
of this procedure are given below.

Then, we note that the use of a unary code to encode the lattice
codebook numbers (**n**) implies that each split requires actually
5*n~k~* bits, when it is quantized using a point in the lattice codebook
with number *n~k~*. That is, *n~k~* bits are used by the unary code
(*n~k~* -1 successive \"1\'s\" and a final \"0\") to indicate how many
blocks of 4 bits are used in the codebook index, and 4*n~k~* bits are
used to form the actual lattice codebook index in codebook *n~k~*) for
the split. Note also that when a split is not quantized (i.e. set to
zero by the TCX quantizer), it still requires 1 bit (a \"0\") in the
unary code, to indicate that the decoder must skip this split and set it
to zero.

Now, more details related to the multiplexing of algebraic vector
quantizer indices in one or several packets are given below, in
particular regarding the splitting of TCX indices in more than one
packet (for 512-and 1024-sample TCX) and the management of overflow in
writing the bits into the packets.

Recall that the codebook numbers are integers defined in the set
{0,2,3,4,\...., 36}. Each *n~k~* has to be represented in a proper
binary format, denoted hereafter *n*^E^*~k~*, for multiplexing.

#### 5.6.1.1 Multiplexing principle for a single binary table

The multiplexing in a single binary table **t** consists of writing
bit-by-bit all the elements of **n** and **i** inside **t**, where the
table **t** = (*t*~0~,..., *t*~R-1~) contains *R* bits (which
corresponds to the number of bits allocated to algebraic VQ).

A straightforward strategy amounts to writing sequentially the elements
of **n**^E^ and **i** in the binary table **t**, as follows:

\[*n*^E^*~0~* *i~0\ ~* *n*^E^*~1~* *i~1~* *n*^E^*~2~* *i~2~* \.... \]

In this case, the bits of *n*^E^*~0~* are written from position 0 in
**t** and upward, the bits of *i*~0~ then follow, etc. This format is
uniquely decodable, because the encoded codebook number *n*^E^*~k~*
indicates the size of *i~k~*.

Instead, an alternative format is used as described below:

\[ i~0~ i~1~ i~2\ ......~ n^E^~2~ n^E^~1~ n^E^~0~ \]

The codebook numbers are written sequentially and downward from the end
of the binary table **t**, whereas the indices are written sequentially
and upward from the beginning of the table. This format has the
advantage to separate codebook numbers and indices. This allows to take
into account the different bit sensitivity of codebook numbers and
indices. Indeed, with the multi-rate lattice vector quantization used,
the codebooks numbers are the most sensitive parametersThus, they are
written from the beginning of the table **t** and take around 20% of the
total bit consumption, giving bitstream ordering according to bit
sensitivity.

For the actual multiplexing, two pointers are then defined on the binary
table **t**: one for (encoded) codebooks numbers *pos~n~*, another for
indices *pos~i~*. The pointer *pos~i~* is initialized to 0 (i.e. the
beginning of the binary table), and *pos~n~* to R-1 (i.e. the end of the
binary table). Positive increments are used for *pos~i~*, and negative
ones for *pos~n~*. At any time, the number of bits left in the binary
table is given by *pos~n~*-*pos~i~*+1.

The table **t** is initialized to zero. This guarantees that if no data
is written, the data inside this table will correspond to an all-zero
codebook numbers **n** (this follows from the definition of the unary
code used here). The splits are then written sequentially in the binary
table from *k=0* to *K-1*: \[*n*^E^*~0~* *i~0~*\] then \[*n*^E^*~1~*
*i~1~*\] then \[*n*^E^*~2~* *i~2~*\], etc.

The data of the *k*th split are really written in the binary table **t**
only if the minimal bit consumption of the *k*th split, denoted *R~k~*
hereafter, is less than the number of bits left in table **t**, i.e. if
*R~k~* ≤ *pos~n~*-*pos~i~*+1. For the multi-rate lattice vector
quantization used here, the minimal bit consumption *R~k~* equals to 0
bit if *n~k~*=0, or 5*n~k~*-1 bits if *n~k~*≥2.

The multiplexing works as follows as shown in the algorithm of Figure
11.

+----------------------------------------------------------------------+

Figure 11: Multiplexing algorithm for one binary table

In practice, the binary table **t** is physically represented as having
4-bit elements instead of binary (1-bit) elements, so as to accelerate
the write-in-table operations and avoid too many bit manipulations. This
optimization is significant because the indices *i~k~* are typically
formatted into 4-bit blocks. In this case, the value of pos~i~ is always
a multiple of 4. However, this implies to use bit shifts and modular
arithmetic on pointers pos~n~ and pos~i~ to locate positions in the
table.

#### 5.6.1.2 Multiplexing in case of multiple binary tables

In the case of multiple binary tables, the algebraic VQ parameters are
written in *P* tables t*~0~*, ..., t*~P-1~* (*P*≥1) containing
respectively *r~0~*, ..., *r~P-1~* bits, such that *r~0~*+...+*r~P-1~* =
*R*. In other words, the bit budget allocated to algebraic VQ
parameters, *R*, is distributed to *P* binary tables. Here, *L* is set
to 1 in the 256-sample TCX mode, 2 in the 512-sample TCX mode or 4 in
the 1024-sample TCX mode.

Note that the multiplexing of algebraic VQ parameters in TCX modes
employs frame-zero-fill if the bit budget allocated to algebraic VQ is
not fully used.

We assume that the number of sub-vectors, *K*, is a multiple of *P*.
Under this assumption, the algebraic VQ parameters are then divided into
*P* groups of equal cardinality: each group comprises *K/P* (encoded)
codebook numbers and *K/P* indices. By convention, the *p*th group is
defined as the set (*n^E^~p+jP~*, *i~p+jP~*)*~j=0..K/P-1~*. This can be
seen as a decimation operation (in the usual multi-rate signal
processing sense).

Assuming the size of table t*~p~* is sufficient, the parameters of the
*p*th group are written in table t*~p~*. For the sake of clarity, the
division of sub-vectors is explained below in more details for *P*=1 and
2:

**If *P*=1, the set (*n^E^~p+jP~*, *i~p+jP~*)*~j=0..K/P-1~* for *l*=0
simply corresponds to (*n^E^~0~*, *i~0,~* ..., *n^E^~K-1~*, *i~K-1~*).
These parameters are written in table** t***~0~*. This is the
single-table case.**

**If *P*=2, we have (*n^E^~p+jP~*, *i~p+jP~*)*~j=0..K/P-1~* =
(*n^E^~0~*, *i~0,~* *n^E^~2~*, *i~2~*..., *n^E^~K-2~*, *i~K-2~*) for
*p*=0 and (*n^E^~1~*, *i~1,~* *n^E^~3~*, *i~3~*..., *n^E^~K-1~*,
*i~K-1~*) for *p*=1. Assuming the table sizes are sufficient, the
parameters (*n^E^~0~*, *i~0,~* *n^E^~2~*, *i~2~*..., *n^E^~K-2~*,
*i~K-2~*) are written in table** t***~0~*, while the other parameters
(*n^E^~1~*, *i~1,~* *n^E^~3~*, *i~3~*..., *n^E^~K-1~*, *i~K-1~*) are
written in table** t***~1~*.**

**The case of *P*=4 can be readily understood from the case of *P*=2.**

**As a consequence, in principle the multiplexing in the multiple-table
case boils down to applying several times the single-table multiplexing
principle: the (encoded) codebook numbers (*n^E^~p+jP~*)*~j=0..K/P-1~*
can be written upward from the bottom of each table** t***~p~* and the
indices (*i~p+jP~*)*~j=0..K/P-1~* can be written downward from the end
of each table** t***~p~*. Two pointers are defined for each binary
table** t***~p~*: *pos~n,p~* and *pos~i,p~*. These pointers are
initialized to *pos~i,p\ ~*= 0 and *pos~n,p\ ~*= *r~p\ ~*--1, and are
respectively incremented and decremented.**

**Nonetheless, the multiple-table case is not a straightforward
extension of the single-packet case. It may happen indeed that the
number of bits in (*n^E^~p+jP~*, *i~p+jP~*)*~j=0..K/P-1~* exceeds, for a
given *p,* the number of bits, *r~p~*, available in the binary table**
t**~p~. To deal with such an \"overflow\", an extra table** t***~ex~* is
defined as temporary buffer to write the bits in excess (which have to
be distributed in another table** t***~q~* with *q* ≠ *p*). The size
of** t**~ex~ is set to 4\*36 bits.**

**The actual multiplexing algorithm in the multiple-table case is
detailed below:**

*1) Initialize*: (We assume that a size of r*~p~* bits for each binary
table t*~p~*.)

Set total number of bits to *R*: *nb* = *R*

Initialize the maximum position *last* such that *n~last~* ≥ 2:

last = -1

For *p*=0...*P-1,*

pos~i,p~ = 0 and pos~n,p~ = r~p~ --1~l~

set table t~p~ to zero

*2) Split and write all codebook numbers:*

**For *p*=0...*P-1*, the (encoded) codebook numbers
(*n^E^~p+jP~*)*~j=0..K/P-1~* are written sequentially (downward from the
end) in table** t***~p~*. This is done through two nested loops over *p*
and *j*. In the illustrative embodiment a single loop is used with
modular arithmetic, as detailed below:**

**For *k*=0,...,*K*-1**

*p* =*k* mod *P*

Compute the minimal bit consumption of the *k*th split: *R~k~* = *0* if
*n~k~*=0, 5*n~k\ ~*-1 if *n~k\ ~*≥ 2

If *R~k~* \> *nb, n~k~*=0 else *nb* = *nb* - *R~k~*

If *n~k\ ~*≥ 2, *last* = *k*

Write downward *n^E^~k~* (except the stop bit) in table **t***~p~*
starting from *pos~n~*,*~p~*, and decrement *pos~n~*,*~p~* by *n~k~* -1

If *nb* ≥ 0, write the stop bit of the unary code and decrement
*pos~n~*,*~p~* by 1

It can be checked that for *P*≤4 with a near-equal distribution of *R*
in *r~p~*, no overflow (i.e. bit in excess) in tables t*~l~* can happen
at this step (for *p*=0,..,*P*-1). In general this property must be
verified to apply the algorithm.

*3) Split and write all indices:*

This is the tricky part of the multiplexing algorithm due to the
possibility of overflow.

Find the positions *pos^ovf^~p~* in each binary table t*~p~* (with *p* =
1...*P*) from which the bits in overflow can be written. These positions
are computed assuming the indices are written by 4-bit block.

For *p* = 0..*P*-1

*pos = 0*

*nb = pos~n,p~ + 1*

**For *k* = *p* to *last* with a step of *P***

If *n~k~* \> 0,

If *4n~k~ ≤ nb, nb~1~* = *n~k~*

else *nb~1\ ~*= *nb* \>\> 2 (where \>\> is a bit shift operator)

*nb* = *nb* -- 4\* *nb~1~*

*pos* = *pos* + *nb~1~*

pos^ovf^~p~ = pos\*4

The indices can then be written as follows:

**For *p* = 0..*P*-1**

***pos* = 0**

**For *l* = *p* to *N*-1 with a step of *P***

***nb* = *pos~n,p~* -- *pos***

*Write the 4n~k~ bits of i~k~:*

Compute the number, *nb~1~*, of 4-bit blocks which can fit in table
**t***~p~* and the number, *nb~2~*, of 4-bit blocks in excess (to be
written temporarily in table **t***~ex~*):

If 4n~k~ ≤ nb, nb~1~ = n~k~, nb~2~ = 0

else nb~1~ = nb \>\> 2 (where \>\> is a bit shift operator), nb~2~ =
n~k~ -- nb~1~

Write upward the *4nb~1~* bits of *i~k~* from *pos~i,p~* to
*pos~i,p~*+4*nb~1~*-1 in table **t***~p~*, and increment *pos~i,p~* by
*4nb~1~*

If *nb~2\ ~*≥ 0,

Initialize *pos~ovf~* to 0

Write upward the remaining *4nb~2~* bits of *i~k~* from *pos~ovf~* to
*pos~ovf~*+4*nb~2~*-1 in table **t***~ex~*, and increment *pos~ovf~* by
*4nb~ovf~*

**Distribute the 4*nb*~2~** **bits in table** t*~p~* **(with *q* ≠ *p*)
based on the pointers *pos^ovf^~q~* and *pos~n,q~* and the pointers
*pos^ovf^~q~* are updated.**

### 5.6.2 Packetization procedure for all parameters

The coding parameters computed in a 1024-sample super-frame at the
encoder are multiplexed into 4 binary packets of equal size. The
packetization consists of a multiplexing loop over 4 iterations. The
size of each packet is set to *R~total~ / 4* where *R~total~* is the
number of bits allocated to the super-frame.

Recall that the mode selected in the 1024-sample super-frame has the
form *(m~1~, m~2~, m~3~, m~4~)*, where *m~k~*=0, 1, 2 or 3, with the
mapping: 0 → 256-sample ACELP, 1 → 256-sample TCX, 2 → 512-sample TCX, 3
→ 1024-sample TCX

![](media/image124.wmf){width="6.694444444444445in" height="6.7in"}

Figure 12: Structure of transmission packets for all four frame types

The multiplexing in the *k*-th packet is performed according to the
value of *m~k~*. The corresponding packet format is shown in Figure 12.
There are 3 cases:

If *m~k~*=0 or 1, the *k*-th packet simply contains all parameters
related to a 256-sample frame, where the parameters are the 2-bit mode
information (\'00\' or \'01\' in binary format), the parameters of ACELP
or those of 256-sample TCX, and the parameters of 256-sample HF coding.

If *m~k~*=2, the *p*-th packet contains half of the bits of the
512-sample TCX mode, half of the bits of 512-sample HF coding, plus the
2-bit mode information (\'10\' in binary format).

If *m~k~*=3, the *k*-th packet contains one fourth of the bits
describing the 512-sample TCX mode, one fourth of the bits of
1024-sample HF coding, plus the 2-bit mode information (\'11\' in binary
format).

The packetization is therefore straightforward if the *k*-th packet
corresponds to ACELP or 256-sample TCX. The packetization is slightly
more involved if 512- or 1024-sample TCX mode is used, because the bits
of the 512- or 1024-sample modes have to be shared into even parts.

### 5.6.3 TCX gain multiplexing

It was found that the TCX gain is important to maintain audible quality
in case of packet loss. Thus, in 512-sample and 1024-sample TCX frames,
the TCX gain value is encoded redundantly in multiple packets to protect
against packet loss. The TCX gain is encoded at a resolution of 7 bits,
and these bits are labelled \"Bit 0\" to \"Bit 6\", where \"Bit 0\" is
the Least Significant Bit (LSB) and \"Bit 6\" is the Most Significant
Bit (MSB). We consider two cases, TCX512 and TCX1024, where the encoded
bits are split into two or four packets, respectively.

***At the Encoder side***

**TCX512**: The first packet contains the full gain information (7
bits). The second packet repeats the most significant 6 bits (\"Bit 1\"
to \"Bit 7\").

**TCX1024**: The first packet contains the full gain information (7
bits). The third packet contains a copy of the three bits \"Bit 4\",
\"Bit 5\" and \"Bit 6\". The fourth packet contains a copy of the three
bits \"Bit 1\", \"Bit 2\" and \"Bit 3\".

Additionally, a 3-bit \"parity\" is formed as thus: combining by logical
XOR \"Bit 1\" and \"Bit 4\" to generate \"Parity Bit 0\", combining by
logical XOR \"Bit 2\" and \"Bit 5\" to generate \"Parity Bit 1\", and
combining by logical XOR \"Bit 3\" and \"Bit 6\" to generate \"Parity
Bit 2\". These three parity bits are sent in the second packet.

***At the Decoder side***

*The logic applied at the decoder to recover the TCX gain when missing
packets occur for 512-sample TCX and 1024-sample TCX. We assume that
there is at least one packet missing before entering the flowchart.*

**TCX512**: If the fist packet is flagged as being lost, the TCX global
gain is taken from the second packet, with the LSB (\"Bit 0\") being set
to zero. If only the second packet is lost, then the full TCX gain is
obtained from the first packet.

**TCX1024**: The gain recovery algorithm is only used if 1 or 2 packets
forming an 1024-sample TCX frame are lost; as described in Section
6.5.1.1. If 3 or more packets are lost in a TCX1024 frame, the MODE is
changed to (1,1,1,1) and BFI=(1,1,1,1). When only 1 or 2 packets are
lost in a TCX1024 frame, the recovery algorithm is as follows:

As described above, the second, third and fourth packets of a TCX1024
frame contain the parity bits, \"Bit 6\" to \"Bit 4\", and \"Bit 3\" to
\"Bit 1\" of the TCX gain. These bits (three each) are stored in
\"parity\", \"index0\" and \"index1\" respectively.

If the third packet is lost, \"index0\" is replaced by the logical XOR
combination of \"parity\" and \"index1\". That is, \"Bit 6\" is
generated from the logical XOR of \"Parity Bit 2\" and \"Bit 3\", \"Bit
5\" is generated from the logical XOR of \"Parity Bit 1\" and \"Bit 2\",
and \"Bit 4\" is generated from the logical XOR of \"Parity Bit 0\" and
\"Bit 1\".

If the fourth packet is lost, \"index1\" is replaced by the logical XOR
combination of \"parity\" and \"index0. That is, \"Bit 3\" is generated
from the logical XOR of \"Parity Bit 2\" and \"Bit 6\", \"Bit 2\" is
generated from the logical XOR of \"Parity Bit 1\" and \"Bit 5\", and
\"Bit 1\" is generated from the logical XOR of \"Parity Bit 0\" and
\"Bit 4\".

Finally, the 7-bit TCX gain value is taken from the recovered bits
(\"Bit 1\" to \"Bit 6\") and \"Bit 0\" is set to zero.

### 5.6.4 Stereo Packetization

![](media/image125.wmf){width="6.6930555555555555in"
height="4.5152777777777775in"}

Stereo parameters computed in a 1024-sample super-frame at the encoder
are multiplexed into 4 binary packets of equal size. The packetization
consists of a similar multiplexing loop as for the core encoder. The
stereo packets are appended at the end of the mono packets.

6 Functional description of the decoder
=======================================

The function of the decoder consists of decoding the transmitted
parameters (LP parameters, ACELP/TCX mode, adaptive codebook vector,
adaptive codebook gain, fixed codebook vector, fixed codebook gain, TCX
parameters, high-band parameters, stereo information) and performing
synthesis to obtain the reconstructed low-frequency and high-frequency
signals. For stereo signal synthesis, the stereo low- and mid-band
signals are reconstructed using the low-frequency mono signal and the
transmitted and decoded stereo parameters (...).

Section 6.1 describes the reconstruction, by the decoder, of the mono
low-band signal in the 0-Fs/4 kHz bandwidth (core ACELP/TCX decoder).
The reconstruction of the higher frequency band using bandwidth
extension and the mixing of the low and high frequencies of the mono
signal will be described respectively in Sections 6.2 and 6.3. The
generation of the stereo signals will be described in Section 6.4.
Finally, Section 6.5 describes the concealment algorithm in the case of
missing frames.

6.1 Mono Signal Low-Band synthesis
----------------------------------

The 0-Fs/4 kHz band of the mono signal is reconstructed by the core
ACELP/TCX decoder. In ACELP mode, the decoder is the same as AMR-WB. The
TCX mode of the decoder will be described in more details below.
Selection between ACELP and TCX decoding in each 256-sample frame is
controlled by the mode indicators described in Section 5.2.2 of the
encoder. These mode indicators are transmitted as 2 bits in each
256-sample packet.

### 6.1.1 ACELP mode decoding and signal synthesis

Same as 3GPP TS 26.190.

### 6.1.2 TCX mode decoding and signal synthesis

The TCX decoder is shown in Figure 13.

![](media/image126.wmf){width="6.690972222222222in" height="5.56875in"}

Figure 13: Block diagram of the TCX decoder

Figure 13 shows a block diagram of the TCX decoder including the
following two cases:

**Case 1**: Packet-erasure concealment in TCX-256 when the TCX frame
length is 256 samples and the related packet is lost i.e. **BFI\_TCX** =
(1), as shown in Figure 13-a.

**Case 2**: Normal TCX decoding, possibly with partial packet losses, as
shown in Figure 13-b..

In Case 1, no information is available to decode the 256-sample TCX
frame. The TCX synthesis is found by processing the past excitation
delayed by *T*, where *T=pitch\_tcx* is a pitch lag estimated in the
previously decoded TCX frame, by a non-linear filter roughly equivalent
to ![](media/image127.wmf){width="0.5138888888888888in"
height="0.2638888888888889in"}. A non-linear filter is used instead of
![](media/image127.wmf){width="0.5138888888888888in"
height="0.2638888888888889in"} to avoid clicks in the synthesis. This
filter is decomposed in 3 steps:

**Step 1**: filtering by

![](media/image128.wmf){width="1.2222222222222223in"
height="0.5277777777777778in"}

to map the excitation delayed by *T* into the TCX target domain;

**Step 2**: applying a limiter (the magnitude is limited to ±
*rms*~wsyn~)

**Step 3**: filtering by

![](media/image129.wmf){width="0.5833333333333334in"
height="0.5138888888888888in"}

to find the synthesis. Note that the buffer **OVLP\_TCX** is set to zero
in this case.

**Decoding of the algebraic VQ parameters**

In Case 2, TCX decoding involves decoding the algebraic VQ parameters
describing each quantized block
![](media/image130.wmf){width="0.2361111111111111in"
height="0.2604166666666667in"} of the scaled spectrum *X\'*, where *X\'*
is as described in Step 2 of Section 5.3.5.7. Recall that ***X\'*** has
dimension *N*, where *N* = 288, 576 and 1152 for TCX-256, 512 and 1024
respectively, and that each block *B\'~k~* has dimension 8. The number
*K* of blocks *B\'~k~* is thus 36, 72 and 144 for TCX-256, 512 and 1024
respectively. The algebraic VQ parameters for each block *B\'~k~* are
described in Step 5 of Section 5.3.5.7. For each block *B\'~k~* , three
sets of binary indices are sent by the encoder:

a\) the [codebook index]{.underline} *n~k~*, transmitted in unary code
as described in Step 5 of Section 5.3.5.7;

b\) the [rank]{.underline} *I~k~* of a selected lattice point *c* in a
so-called *base codebook*, which indicates what permutation has to be
applied to a specific *leader* (see Step 5 of Section 5.3.5.7) to obtain
a lattice point ***c***;

c\) and, if the quantized
block![](media/image130.wmf){width="0.2361111111111111in"
height="0.2604166666666667in"} (a lattice point) was not in the base
codebook, the 8 indices of the [Voronoi extension index]{.underline}
vector ***k*** calculated in sub-step V1 of Step 5 in Section; from the
Voronoi extension indices, an extension vector ***z*** can be computed
as in reference \[7\]. The number of bits in each component of index
vector ***k*** is given by the extension order *r*, which can be
obtained from the unary code value of index *n~k~* . The scaling factor
*M* of the Voronoi extension is given by *M* = 2*^r^*.

Then, from the scaling factor *M*, the Voronoi extension vector ***z***
(a lattice point in *RE~8~*) and the lattice point ***c*** in the base
codebook (also a lattice point in *RE~8~*), each quantized scaled block
![](media/image130.wmf){width="0.2361111111111111in"
height="0.2604166666666667in"} can be computed as

![](media/image130.wmf){width="0.2361111111111111in"
height="0.2604166666666667in"} = *M* **c + *z***

When there is no Voronoi extension (i.e. *n~k~* \< 5, *M*=1 and *z*=0),
the base codebook is either codebook *Q*~0~, *Q*~2~, *Q*~3~ or *Q*~4~
from reference \[6\]. No bits are then required to transmit *vector
**k***. Otherwise, when Voronoi extension is used because
![](media/image130.wmf){width="0.2361111111111111in"
height="0.2604166666666667in"} is large enough, then only *Q*~3~ or
*Q*~4~ from reference \[6\] is used as a base codebook. The selection of
*Q*~3~ or *Q*~4~ is implicit in the codebook index value *n~k~*,, as
described in Step 5 of Section 5.3.5.7.

**Decoding of the noise-fill parameter**

The noise fill-in level *σ*~noise~ is decoded by inverting the 3-bit
uniform scalar quantization calculated at the encoder as in Step 4 of
Section 5.3.5.7 . For an index 0 ≤ *idx*~1~ ≤ *7*, *σ*~noise~ is given
by: *σ*~noise~ = 0.1 \* (8 - *idx*~1~). However, it may happen that the
index *idx*~1~ is not available. This is the case when **BFI\_TCX** =
(1) in TCX-256, (1 *X*) in TCX-512 and (X 1 X *X*) in TCX-1024, with X
representing an arbitrary binary value. In this case, *σ*~noise~ is set
to its maximal value, i.e. *σ*~noise~ = 0.8.

Comfort noise is injected in the subvectors *B*~k~ rounded to zero and
which correspond to a frequency above Fs/2 kHz 4. More precisely,
***Z*** is initialized as ***Z*** = ***Y*** and for K/6 *≤ k ≤ K*
(only), if ***Y***~k\ =~ (0, 0, ...,0), ***Z***~k~ is replaced by the
8-dimensional vector:

*σ*~noise~ \* \[ cos(θ~1~) sin(θ~1~) cos(θ~2~) sin(θ~2~) cos(θ~3~)
sin(θ~3~) cos(θ~4~) sin(θ~4~) \],

where the phases θ~1~, θ~2~, θ~3~ and θ~4~ are randomly selected.

Low-frequency de-emphasis

After decoding the algebraic VQ parameters and noise-fill parameter, we
obtain the quantized pre-shaped TCX spectrum *X\'*. De-shaping is then
applied as in Section 5.3.5.6.

**Estimation of the dominant pitch value**

The estimation of the dominant pitch is performed so that the next frame
to be decoded can be properly extrapolated if it corresponds to TCX-256
and if the related packet is lost. This estimation is based on the
assumption that the peak of maximal magnitude in spectrum of the TCX
target corresponds to the dominant pitch. The search for the maximum *M*
is restricted to a frequency below Fs/64 kHz

M = max~i=1..N/32~ ( X**\'**~2i~ )^2^+ ( X**\'**~2i+1~ )^2^

and the minimal index 1 ≤ *i*~max~ ≤ *N*/32 such that (
*X**\'***~2*i\ *~)^2^+ ( *X**\'***~2*i+1\ *~)^2^ = *M* is also found.
Then the dominant pitch is estimated in number of samples as *T*~est~ =
*N* / *i*~max~ (this value may not be integer). Recall that the dominant
pitch is calculated for packet-erasure concealment in TCX-256. To avoid
buffering problems (the excitation buffer being limited to 256 samples
), if *T*~est~ \> 256 samples, *pitch\_tcx* is set to 256 ; otherwise,
if *T*~est~ ≤ 256, multiple pitch period in 256 samples are avoided by
setting *pitch\_tcx* to

*pitch\_tcx* = max {  *n* *T*~est~  \| *n* integer \> 0 and *n*
*T*~est~ ≤ 256}

where *.* denotes the rounding to the nearest integer towards -∞.

Inverse transform

To obtain the quantized perceptual signal, an inverse transform is
applied to the de-shaped spectrum *X\'.* The transform used at the
encoder and decoder is a the discrete Fourier transform, and is
implemented as an FFT and IFFT, respectively. Recall that due to the
ordering used at the TCX encoder, the transform coefficients
**X\'**=(*X\'~0~*,...,*X\'~N-1~*) are such that:

*X\'~0\ ~*corresponds to the DC coefficient,

*X\'~1\ ~*corresponds to the Nyquist frequency, and

the coefficients X\'*~2k~* and X\'*~2k+1~*, for *k*=1..N/2-1, are the
real and imaginary parts of the Fourier component of frequency of
*k(*/*N*/2) \* Fs/4 kHz.

*X\'~1~* is always forced to 0. After this zeroing, the time-domain TCX
target signal ***x\'***~w~ is found by applying an inverse FFT to the
quantized scaled spectrum *X*. Rescaling will be applied in the
following section, to obtain the total quantized weighted signal prior
to windowing and overlapping.

Decoding of the glocal TCX gain and scaling

The (global) TCX gain *g*~TCX~ is decoded by inverting the 7-bit
logarithmic quantization calculated in the TCX encoder as in Section
5.2.5.10 . First, the r.m.s. value of the TCX target signal ***x\'***~w~
is computed as:

*rms* = sqrt(1/*N* (*x*\'~w0~^2^ + *x*\'~w1~^2^ +...+ *x*\'~w*L-1*~^2^))

From the received 7-bit index 0 ≤ *idx*~2~ ≤ 127, the TCX gain is given
by:

![](media/image131.wmf){width="1.4583333333333333in"
height="0.2638888888888889in"}

The (logarithmic) quantization step is around 0.71 dB.

This gain is used to scale ***x\'***~w~ into ***x***~w~. Note that from
the mode extrapolation and the gain repetition strategy, the index
*idx*~2~ is available in case of frame loss. However, in case of partial
packet losses (1 loss for TCX-512 and up to 2 losses for TCX-1024) the
least significant bit of *idx*~2~ may be set by default to 0 in the
demultiplexer.

Windowing and overlap

Since the TCX encoder employs windowing with overlap and weighted ZIR
removal prior to transform coding of the target signal, the
reconstructed TCX target signal ***x*** = (*x*~0~, *x*~1~, ...,
*x~N~*~-1~) is actually found by overlap-add. The overlap-add depends on
the type of the previous decoded frame (ACELP or TCX). The TCX target
signal is first multiplied by a window **w** = \[*w*~0~ w~1~ ...
w*~N-1~*\], whose shape is described in Section 5.3.5.4.

Then, the overlap from the past decoded frame (**OVLP\_TCX**) is added
to the present windowed signal **x**. The overlap length OVLP\_TCX
depends on the past TCX framelength and on the mode of the past frame
(ACELP or TCX).

Computation of the synthesis signal

The reconstructed TCX target is then filtered through the zero-state
inverse perceptual filter
![](media/image132.wmf){width="1.8194444444444444in"
height="0.2638888888888889in"} to find the synthesis signal which will
be applied to the synthesis filter. The excitation is also calculated to
update the ACELP adaptive codebook and allow to switch from TCX to ACELP
in a subsequent frame. Note that the length of the TCX synthesis is
given by the TCX frame length (without the overlap): 256, 512 or 1024
samples.

### 6.1.3 Post-processing of Mono Low-Band signal

In the low-frequency pitch enhancement, two-band decomposition is used
and adaptive filtering is applied only to the lower band. This results
in a total post-processing that is mostly targeted at frequencies near
the first harmonics of the synthesized speech signal.

![](media/image133.wmf){width="6.233333333333333in"
height="3.4659722222222222in"}

Figure 14: Block diagram of the low frequency pitch enhancer

Figure 14 shows the block diagram of the two-band pitch enhancer. In the
higher branch the decoded signal is filtered by a high-pass filter to
produce the higher band signal (*s*~H~). In the lower branch, the
decoded signal is first processed through an adaptive pitch enhancer,
and then filtered through a low-pass filter to obtain the lower band
post-processed signal (*s*~LEF~). The post-processed decoded signal is
obtained by adding the lower band post-processed signal and the higher
band signal. The object of the pitch enhancer is to reduce the
inter-harmonic noise in the decoded signal, which is achieved here by a
time-varying linear filter with a transfer function

![](media/image134.wmf){width="2.0833333333333335in"
height="0.4305555555555556in"}

and described by the following equation:

![](media/image135.wmf){width="3.0555555555555554in"
height="0.4305555555555556in"} (1)

where *α* is a coefficient that controls the inter-harmonic attenuation,
*T* is the pitch period of the input signal
![](media/image136.wmf){width="0.3333333333333333in"
height="0.2222222222222222in"},
and![](media/image137.wmf){width="0.4583333333333333in"
height="0.2361111111111111in"} is the output signal of the pitch
enhancer. Parameters *T* and *α* vary with time and are given by the
pitch tracking module. With a value of *α* = 1, the gain of the filter
described by Equation (1) is exactly 0 at frequencies 1/(2*T*),3/(2*T*),
5/(2*T*), etc.; i.e. at the mid-point between the harmonic frequencies
1/*T,* 3*/T,* 5*/T,* etc. When *α* approaches 0, the attenuation between
the harmonics produced by the filter of Equation (1) decreases.

To confine the post-processing to the low frequency region, the enhanced
signal *s~LE~* is low pass filtered to produce the signal *s~LEF~* which
is added to the high-pass filtered signal *s~H~* to obtain the
post-processed synthesis signal *s~E~*.

Another configuration equivalent to the one in Figure 14 is used here
which eliminates the need to high-pass filtering. This is explained as
follows.

Let *h~LP~*(*n*) be the impulse response of the low-pass filter and
*h~HP~*(*n*) is the impulse response of the complementary high-pass
filter. The post-processed signal *s~E~*(*n*) is given by

![](media/image138.wmf){width="5.388888888888889in"
height="1.9722222222222223in"}

Thus, the post-processing is equivalent to subtracting the scaled
low-pass filtered long-term error signal from the synthesis signal
![](media/image136.wmf){width="0.3333333333333333in"
height="0.2222222222222222in"}. The transfer function of the long-term
prediction filter is given by

![](media/image139.wmf){width="1.8333333333333333in" height="0.25in"}

The alternative post-processing configuration is depicted in Figure 15.

![](media/image140.wmf){width="6.233333333333333in"
height="3.2319444444444443in"}

Figure 15: Implemented post-processing configuration

The value *T* is given by the received closed-loop pitch lag in each
subframe (the fractional pitch lag rounded to the nearest integer). A
simple tracking for checking pitch doubling is performed. If the
normalized pitch correlation at delay T/2 is larger than 0.95 then the
value T/2 is used as the new pitch lag for post-processing.

The factor ![](media/image141.wmf){width="0.16666666666666666in"
height="0.1527777777777778in"} is by

![](media/image142.wmf){width="0.7777777777777778in"
height="0.2638888888888889in"} constrained to
![](media/image143.wmf){width="0.7916666666666666in" height="0.19375in"}

where ![](media/image144.wmf){width="0.2222222222222222in"
height="0.2638888888888889in"} is the decoded pitch gain. Note that in
TCX mode the value of
![](media/image141.wmf){width="0.16666666666666666in"
height="0.1527777777777778in"} is set to zero.

A linear phase FIR low-pass filter with 25 coefficients is used, with a
cut-off frequency at 5Fs/256 kHz (the filter delay is 12 samples).

6.2 Mono Signal High-Band synthesis
-----------------------------------

The synthesis of the HF signal implements a kind of bandwidth extension
(BWE) mechanism and uses some data from the LF decoder. It is an
evolution of the BWE mechanism used in the AMR-WB speech decoder. The HF
decoder is detailed in Figure 16. The HF signal is synthesized in 2
steps: calculation of the HF excitation signal and computation of the HF
signal from the HF excitation. The HF excitation is obtained by shaping
in time-domain the LF excitation signal with scalar factors (or gains)
per 64-sample subframes. This HF excitation is post-processed to reduce
the \"buzziness\" of the output, and then filtered by a HF
linear-predictive synthesis filter 1/*A*~HF~(*z*). Recall that the LP
order used to encode and then decode the HF signal is 8. The result is
also post-processed to smooth energy variations.

![](media/image145.wmf){width="6.680555555555555in"
height="4.428472222222222in"}

Figure 16: Block diagram of high frequency decoder

The HF decoder synthesizes an 1024-sample HF superframe. This superframe
is segmented according to **MODE** = (*m*~0~, *m*~1~, *m*~2~, *m*~3~).
To be more specific, the decoded frames used in the HF decoder are
synchronous with the frames used in the LF decoder. Hence, *m*~k~ ≤ 1,
*m*~k~ = 2 and *m*~k~ = 3 indicate respectively a 256, 512 and
1024-sample frame. These frames are referred to as HF-256, HF-512 and
HF-1024, respectively.

From the synthesis chain described above, it is clear that the only
parameters needed for HF decoding are ISF and gain parameters. The ISF
parameters represent the filter 1/*A*~HF~(*z*), while the gain
parameters are used to shape the LF excitation signal. These parameters
are demultiplexed based on **MODE** and knowing the format of the
bitstream.

Control data which are internal to the HF decoder are generated from the
bad frame indicator vector **BFI** = (*bfi*~0~, *bfi*~1~, *bfi*~2~,
*bfi*~3~). These data are *bfi\_isf\_hf*, **BFI\_GAIN**, and the number
of subframes for ISF interpolation. The nature of these data is defined
in more details below:

*bfi\_isf\_hf* is a binary flag indicating loss of the ISF parameters.
Its definition is given below from **BFI**.

For HF-256 in packet *k,* *bfi\_isf\_hf* = *bfi*~k~ ,

For HF-512 in packets *k* and *k+1, bfi\_isf\_hf* = *bfi*~k~ ,

For HF-1024 (in packets k=*0 to 3), bfi\_isf\_hf* = *bfi*~0~

This definition can be readily understood from the bitstream format.
Recall that the ISF parameters for the HF signal are always in the first
packet describing HF-256, -512 or --1024 frames.

**BFI\_GAIN** is a binary vector used to signal packet losses to the HF
gain decoder: **BFI\_GAIN** = ( *bfi*~k~ ) for HF-256 in packet *k*, (
*bfi*~k~ *bfi*~k+1~ ) for HF-512 in packets *k* and *k+1*, **BFI\_GAIN**
= **BFI** for HF-1024.

The number of subframes for ISF interpolation refers to the number of
64-sample subframes in the decoded frame. This number is 4 for HF-256, 8
for HF-512 and 16 for HF-1024.

The ISF vector **isf\_hf\_q** is decoded using AR(1) predictive VQ. If
*bfi\_isf\_hf* = 0, the 2-bit index *i*~1~ of the 1^st^ stage and the
7-bit index *i*~2~ of the 2^nd^ stage are available and **isf\_hf\_q**
is given by

**isf\_hf\_q** = **cb1**(*i*~1~) + **cb2**(*i*~2~) + **mean\_isf\_hf** +
μ~isf\_hf~ \* **mem\_isf\_hf**

where **cb1**(*i*~1~) is the *i*~1~--th codevector of the 1^st^ stage,
**cb2**(*i*~2~) is the *i*~2~--th codevector of the 2^st^ stage,
**mean\_isf\_hf** is the mean ISF vector, μ~isf\_hf~ = 0.5 is the AR(1)
prediction coefficient and **mem\_isf\_hf** is the memory of the ISF
predictive decoder.

If *bfi\_isf\_hf* = 1, the decoded ISF vector corresponds to the
previous ISF vector shifted towards the mean ISF vector:

**isf\_hf\_q** = α ~isf\_hf~ \* **mem\_isf\_hf** + **mean\_isf\_hf**

with α ~isf\_hf~ = 0.9. After calculating **isf\_hf\_q**, the ISF
reordering defined in AMR-WB speech coding is applied to **isf\_hf\_q**
with an ISF gap of 9 Fs/1280 Hz. Finally the memory **mem\_isf\_hf** is
updated for the next HF frame as:

**mem\_isf\_hf** = **isf\_hf\_q** - **mean\_isf\_hf**

Note that the initial value of **mem\_isf\_hf** (at the reset of the
decoder) is zero.

A simple linear interpolation between the ISP parameters of the previous
decoded HF frame (HF-256, HF-512 or HF-1024) and the new decoded ISP
parameters is performed. The interpolation is conducted in the ISP
domain and results in ISP parameters for each 64-sample subframe,
according to the formula:

**isp**~subframe-*i*~ = *i*/*nb* \* **isp**~new~ + (1-*i*/*nb)* \*
**isp**~old~,

where *nb* is the number of subframes in the current decoded frame
(*nb*=4 for HF-256, 8 for HF-512, 16 for HF-1024), *i*=0,...,*nb*-1 is
the subframe index, **isp**~old~ is the set of ISP parameters obtained
from the ISF parameters of the previously decoded HF frame and
**isp**~new~ is the set of ISP decoded. The interpolated ISP parameters
are then converted into linear-predictive coefficients for each
subframe.

The computation of the gain *g*~match~ in dB is detailed in the next
paragraphs. This gain is interpolated for each 64-sample subframe based
on its previous value *old*\_*g*~match~ as:

![](media/image146.wmf){width="0.19375in" height="0.25in"} = *i*/*nb* \*
*g*~match~ + (1-*i*/*nb)* \* *old*\_*g*~match~,

where *nb* is the number of subframes in the current decoded frame
(*nb*=4 for HF-256, 8 for HF-512, 16 for HF-1024), *i*=0,...,*nb*-1 is
the subframe index. This results in a vector

![](media/image148.wmf){width="0.34652777777777777in" height="0.25in"}
).

*[Decoding of correction gains and gain computation]{.underline}*

Recall that after gain interpolation the HF decoder gets the estimated
gains (*g*^est^~0~, *g*^est^~1~, ..., *g*^est^~nb-1~) in dB for each of
the *nb* subframes of the current decoded frame. Furthermore, *nb* = 4,
8 and 16 in HF-256, -512 and --1024, respectively. The correction gains
in dB are then decoded which will be added to the estimated gains per
subframe to form the decode gains

= (*g^c1^*~1~, *g^c1^*~1~, ..., *g^c1^*~nb-1~) + (*g^c2^*~0~,
*g^c2^*~1~, ..., *g^c2^*~nb-1~).

Therefore, the gain decoding corresponds to the decoding of predictive
two-stage VQ-scalar quantization, where the prediction is given by the
interpolated Fs/4 kHz junction matching gain. The quantization dimension
is variable and is equal to *nb*.

*Decoding of the 1^st^ stage:*

The 7-bit index 0 ≤ *idx* ≤ 127 of the 1^st^ stage 4-dimensional HF gain
codebook is decoded into 4 gains (*G*~0~, *G*~1~, *G*~2~, *G*~3~). A bad
frame indicator *bfi = BFI\_GAIN~0~* in HF-256, -512 and --1024 allows
to handle packet losses. If *bfi* = 0, these gains are decoded as

(*G*~0~, *G*~1~, *G*~2~, *G*~3~) = **cb\_gain\_hf**(idx) +
*mean\_gain\_hf*

where **cb\_gain\_hf**(*idx*) is the *idx*-th codevector of the codebook
**cb\_gain\_hf**. If *bfi* =1, a memory *past\_gain\_hf\_q* is shifted
towards --20 dB:

*past\_gain\_hf\_q*:= α~gain\_hf~ \* (*past\_gain\_hf\_q + 20) -- 20.*

where α~gain\_hf~ = 0.9 and the 4 gains (*G*~0~, *G*~1~, *G*~2~, *G*~3~)
are set to the same value:

*G*~k~ = *past\_gain\_hf\_q* + *mean\_gain\_hf*, for *k* = 0,1,2 and 3

Then the memory *past\_gain\_hf\_q* is updated as:

*past\_gain\_hf\_q*:= (G~0~ + G~1~ + G~2~ + G~3~)/4 - *mean\_gain\_hf*.

The computation of the 1^st^ stage reconstruction is then given as:

HF-256: (*g^c1^*~0~, *g^c1^*~1~, *g^c1^*~2~ , *g^c1^*~3~) = (*G*~0~,
*G*~1~, *G*~2~, *G*~3~).

HF-512: (*g^c1^*~0~, *g^c1^*~1~, *...,* *g^c1^*~7~) = (*G*~0~, *G*~0~,
*G*~1~, *G*~1~, *G*~2~, *G*~2~, *G*~3~, *G*~3~).

HF-1024: (*g^c1^*~0~, *g^c1^*~1~, *...,* *g^c1^*~15~) = (*G*~0~, *G*~0~,
*G*~0~, *G*~0~, *G*~1~, *G*~1~, *G*~1~, *G*~1~, *G*~2~, *G*~2~, *G*~2~,
*G*~2~, *G*~3~, *G*~3~, *G*~3~, *G*~3~).

*Decoding of 2^nd^ stage:*

In TCX-256, (*g^c2^*~0~, *g^c2^*~1~, *g^c2^*~2~*,* *g^c2^*~3~) is simply
set to (0,0,0,0) and there is no real 2^nd^ stage decoding. In HF-512,
the 2-bit index 0 ≤ *idx*~i~ ≤ 3 of the *i*-th subframe, where *i*=0,
..., 7, is decoded as:

If *bfi* = 0, *g^c2^*~i~ = 3 \* *idx*~i~ -- 4.5 else *g^c2^*~i~ = 0.

In TCX-1024, 16 subframes 3-bit index the 0 ≤ *idx*~i~ ≤ 7 of the *i*-th
subframe, where *i*=0, ..., 15, is decoded as:

If *bfi* = 0, *g^c2^*~i~ = 3 \* idx -- 10.5 else *g^c2^*~i~ = 0.

In TCX-512 the magnitude of the second scalar refinement is up to ± 4.5
dB and in TCX-1024 up to ± 10.5 dB. In both cases, the quantization step
is 3 dB.

*HF gain reconstruction:*

The gain for each subframe is then computed
as:![](media/image159.wmf){width="0.4722222222222222in"
height="0.2222222222222222in"}

**[*Buzziness reduction* *and energy smoothing*]{.underline}**

The role of energy smoothing is to attenuate pulses in the time-domain
HF excitation signal *r*~HF~(*n*), which often cause the audio output to
sound \"buzzy\". Pulses are detected by checking if the absolute value
\| r~HF~(n) \| \> 2 \* *thres*(*n*), where *thres*(*n*) is an adaptive
threshold corresponding to the time-domain envelope of *r*~HF~(*n*). The
samples *r*~HF~(*n*) which are detected as pulses are limited to ± 2 \*
*thres*(*n*), where ± is the sign of *r*~HF~(*n*).

Each sample *r*~HF~(*n*) of the HF excitation is filtered by a 1^st^
order low-pass filter 0.02/(1 - 0.98 *z*^-1^) to update *thres*(*n*).
Note that the initial value of *thres*(*n*) (at the reset of the
decoder) is 0. The amplitude of the pulse attenuation is given by:

∆ = max( \|*r*~HF~(*n*)\|-2\**thres*(*n*) , 0.0).

Thus, ∆ is set to 0 if the current sample is not detected as a pulse,
which will let *r*~HF~(*n*) unchanged. Then, the current value
*thres*(*n*) of the adaptive threshold is changed as:

*thres*(*n*):= *thres*(*n*) + 0.5 \* ∆.

Finally each sample *r*~HF~(*n*) is modified to: *r\'*~HF~(*n*) =
*r*~HF~(*n*) --∆ if *r*~HF~(*n*) ≥ 0, and *r\'*~HF~(*n*) = *r*~HF~(*n*)
+∆ otherwise.

The short-term energy variations of the HF synthesis *s*~HF~(*n*) are
then smoothed. The energy is measured by subframe. The energy of each
subframe is modified by up to ± 1.5 dB based on an adaptive threshold.

For a given subframe *s*~HF~(*n*), *n*=0,...,63, the subframe energy is
calculated as

![](media/image160.wmf){width="1.5416666666666667in"
height="0.4722222222222222in"}

The value *t* of the threshold is updated as:

*t* := min( ε\* 1.414, *t* ), if ε \< *t*

max( ε / 1.414, *t* ), otherwise.

The current subframe is then scaled by
![](media/image161.wmf){width="0.4166666666666667in" height="0.25in"}:

![](media/image162.wmf){width="1.5416666666666667in"
height="0.2638888888888889in"}, *n*=0,...,63

6.3 Stereo Signal synthesis
---------------------------

![](media/image163.wmf){width="5.092361111111111in"
height="1.4694444444444446in"}

For stereo signal decoding, the mono signal is needed. First, the output
of the core decoder is split into two bands , these two signals
![](media/image14.wmf){width="0.5416666666666666in" height="0.25in"} and
![](media/image164.wmf){width="0.6111111111111112in" height="0.25in"}
are fed to the low band and high band stereo decoder.

### 6.3.1 Stereo signal low-band synthesis

![](media/image165.wmf){width="5.35625in" height="5.4006944444444445in"}

The AVQ parameters are decoded in a similar way as described in section
6.1.2, after decoding the step of spectrum de-shaping is performed in
order to de-emphasize the spectral coefficients.

The global gain decoding is performed according to Section 6.1. by
inverting the 7-bit logarithmic quantization calculated in the encoder
as in Section 5.5.1. The signal after inverse transform is multiplied by
the global gain in order to produce a time domain signal
![](media/image166.wmf){width="0.34652777777777777in"
height="0.2222222222222222in"}.

Decoding the balance factor is done by inverting the 7 bit scalar
quantizer. In the case of mode 0, a signal envelope is estimated from
the mono signal ![](media/image14.wmf){width="0.5416666666666666in"
height="0.25in"} and this signal is compensated for the envelope. The
resulting signal is multiplied by the balance factor and added to the
time domain signal ![](media/image166.wmf){width="0.34652777777777777in"
height="0.2222222222222222in"}. The estimated time domain envelope is
used in order to shape the resulting signal and reduce the pre-echo
artefact when mode 0 is selected in the encoder.

Adaptive overlap-add is used in order to synthesise the time domain side
signal ![](media/image167.wmf){width="0.5138888888888888in"
height="0.25in"}which is used to produce the low frequencies left and
right signal ![](media/image168.wmf){width="0.5277777777777778in"
height="0.25in"}, ![](media/image169.wmf){width="0.5138888888888888in"
height="0.25in"}.

### 6.3.2 Stereo Signal Mid-Band synthesis

![](media/image170.wmf){width="6.694444444444445in"
height="2.717361111111111in"}

The mono mid-band signal is filtered in order to obtain the mid-band
excitation signal ![](media/image171.wmf){width="0.5965277777777778in"
height="0.25in"}. The filter and the corresponding gains are decoded by
using the inverse operation of the predictive multistage quantizer
(MSPVQ^-1^) and the predictive 2 dimensional vector quantizer (PVQ^-1^).

The filter is used to filter the excitation signal
![](media/image171.wmf){width="0.5965277777777778in" height="0.25in"}
according to

![](media/image172.wmf){width="3.3194444444444446in"
height="0.4722222222222222in"}

the two channels pseudo-excitations are computed as:

![](media/image173.wmf){width="4.375in" height="0.4722222222222222in"}

![](media/image174.wmf){width="4.346527777777778in"
height="0.4722222222222222in"}

Windowing and overlap add is used in norder to smooth the frame
transitions. The anount of overlap is equal to
![](media/image175.wmf){width="0.3611111111111111in"
height="0.2638888888888889in"}according to the following figure

![](media/image176.wmf){width="3.8513888888888888in"
height="2.345833333333333in"}

The output of the overlap add sections are finally inverse filtered by
the core low band signal lpc filter
![](media/image177.wmf){width="0.5138888888888888in"
height="0.2222222222222222in"} to produce the left and right mid-band
signals ![](media/image178.wmf){width="0.5833333333333334in"
height="0.25in"}and ![](media/image179.wmf){width="0.5833333333333334in"
height="0.25in"}.

### 6.3.3 Stereo Signal High-Band synthesis

Same as mono signal high band synthesis, the high band for each signal
is delayed slightly to be aligned with the low and midband stereo signal

### 6.3.4 Stereo output signal generation

The low and high frequencies of the low band left and right channels are
combined together according to the following figure

![](media/image180.wmf){width="4.295138888888889in" height="0.975in"}

The obtained low band left and right channels are combined with the high
band signals in order to restore the full band left and right channels.

6.4 Stereo to mono conversion
-----------------------------

In the case the application or hardware does not support stereo output,
the output of the synthesised output stereo bit stream needs to be mixed
to mono.

### 6.4.1 Low-Band synthesis

The low band stereo output is converted to mono by omitting the stereo
information in the bit stream and skipping the stereo decoder. Hence,
the mono output is synthesised only according to Section 6.1.

### 6.4.2 High-Band synthesis

The stereo bit stream contains separate bandwidth extensions for left
and right High-Band synthesis. To minimise the decoder complexity, the
stereo to mono down mixing is done on parameter level.

First the High-Band gain factors for both left and right channel are
decoded as explained in Section 6.2. The gain difference of left and
right channels is calculated in dB scale. When the difference is greater
than 20 dB, the LP synthesis filter coefficients of the higher energy
channel are selected for the mono output synthesis filtering and the LP
parameters from the lower energy channel are omitted completely. On the
other hand, when the gain difference is less than the 20 dB threshold,
the LP synthesis filter coefficients of left and right channel are
averaged in ISP domain. The gain parameters from left and right channels
are averaged in both cases. When the LP synthesis filter coefficients
and gain factor is determined, the High-Band synthesis is done according
to mono signal High-Band synthesis in Section 6.2.

6.5 Bad frame concealment
-------------------------

### 6.5.1 Mono

#### 6.5.1.1 Mode decoding and extrapolation

In the presence of packet losses, the decoder tries to recover the
missing mode indicators from the available ones (including also mode
indicators of previous superframes). Recall that the mode selected in a
given super-frame is given by **MODE** = (*m*~0~, *m*~1~, *m*~2~,
*m*~3~) where 0 ≤ *m*~k~ ≤ 3 and k=0,..,3. The 26 valid modes are
enumerated in Table10. When frame *k* is missing at the receiver,
*bfi*~k~ is set to 1. When *bfi*~k~ = 1, the value *m*~k~ is not
available and has to be estimated from other received information.

The mode extrapolation is essentially based on a mode repetition logic.
The mode indicators from the previous super-frame only are reused in the
extrapolation. More precisely, only the last indicator of the previous
mode is used. Hence, the modes of the four 256-sample frames in the
previous superframe are seen as (X, X, X, *m~-1~*) where the value X is
not relevant (this value is not used here) and 0 ≤ *m~-1\ ~* ≤ 3 is the
final indicator of the previous mode. Note that if *m~-1\ ~* was not
available, the extrapolated value of *m~-1\ ~* is used.

A high-level block diagram of the mode extrapolation module is given in
Figure 17.

![](media/image181.wmf){width="4.745833333333334in"
height="1.3715277777777777in"}

Figure 17: High-level block diagram of mode extrapolation module

Based on the values in **BFI**, the available mode indicators are set
from the bits coming from the demultiplexer. The number of packet losses
*n*~loss~ is counted as the number of *bfi*~k~ values set to 1. The mode
is given by **MODE =** (*m*~0~, *m*~1~, *m*~2~, *m*~3~) with 0 ≤ *m*~k~
≤ 3 when the indicator *m*~k~ is available (i.e. *bfi*~k~ = 0), and
*m*~k~ = -1 when *bfi*~k~ = 1. Then, the missing mode indicators (for
which *m*~k~ = -1) are extrapolated. The logic of this mode
extrapolation is shown in Figure 18.

![](media/image182.wmf){width="5.975in" height="8.049305555555556in"}

Figure 18: Mode extrapolation logic

The rationale behind the mode extrapolation logic in Figure 18 is as
follows:

\- There exists redundancy in the definition of mode indicators. A
TCX-1024 frame is described by **MODE** = (3,3,3,3), and a TCX-512 frame
is described by (2,2,X,X) or (X,X,2,2). Therefore, *in the absence of
bit errors*, the mode indicators describing a TCX-512 or TCX-1024 frame
can be easily extrapolated in case of partial packet losses, when a
single value *m*~k~ = 2 or 3 is available.

\- The frame-erasure concealment in ACELP mode relies on the pitch delay
and codebook gains of the previous ACELP frame. However in switched
ACELP/TCX coding there is no guarantee that the frame preceding an ACELP
frame was also encoded by ACELP. Assuming that *m*~k~ is not available
and that the extrapolation has to choose between *m*~k~ = 0 or *m*~k~ =
1, the extrapolation will select ACELP decoding (*m*~k~ = 0) only if
*m~k-1~* = 0 Otherwise the ACELP parameters needed for concealment would
not be up-to-date. As a consequence, under the above assumptions, if
*m*~k-1~\>0, the value *m*~k~ = 1 will be selected.

\- If 3 packets are lost and if the only available mode indicator is
*m*~k~ = 3 with *k* =0,1,2 or 3, a mode (3,3,3,3) corresponding to
TCX-1024 should normally be extrapolated. Yet, with the bitstream format
described in Section 5.6, losing 3 packets out of 4 in TCX-1024 means

1\) losing roughly 3 quarters of the TCX target spectrum and

2\) having no information about the TCX global gain since the gain
repetition in TCX-1024 is designed to perform well for up to 2 packet
losses.

As a consequence, the mode (3,3,3,3) is rather replaced by the mode
(1,1,1,1) in the extrapolation when more than 2 packets are lost. Note
that this causes the concealment of TCX-256 to be used (the synthesis
will actually be progressively faded out).

#### 6.5.1.2 TCX bad frame concealment

Concealment of TCX256 erased frames was described in Section 6.2.1.

In the case of a TCX1024 partial frame loss and given that the previous
decoded frame was also a TCX1024 frame a spectral fill-in strategy is
used in order to conceal the lost packets. The fill-in strategy assumes
that since we have a case of two consecutive 1024-sample TCX frames, the
signal is quasi stationary so that lost subvectors can be interpolated
from the previous frame.

##### 6.5.1.2.1 Spectrum de-shaping

Spectrum de-shaping is applied to the quantized spectrum as described in
Section 5.3.5.8. In case of frame erasure, the de-shaping uses a
prediction of the new maximum using the previously saved quantized
spectrum. De-shaping is done according to the following steps:

\- Compute the maximum energy *OldE~max~* of the 8-dimensional block at
position index *m* of the previous 1024-sample TCX frame

\- Compute the maximum energy *E~max~* of the 8-dimensional block at
position index *m* of the current 1024-sample TCX frame

\- If *E~max~* \< *OldE~max~*, then set *E~max~* = *OldE~max~*

\- Calculate the energy *E~m~* of the 8-dimensional block at position
index *m*

\- Compute the ratio *R~m~* = *E~max~* / *E~m~*

\- Compute the value (*R~m~*) ^½^

\- if *R~m~* \> 10, then set *R~m~* = 10 (maximum gain of 20 dB)

\- also, if *R~m~* \> *R ~m-1~* then *R~m~* = *R~m-1~*

This allows in case of the loss of the 8-dimensional block corresponding
to the maximum to use the previous maximum.

##### 6.5.1.2.2 Spectrum Extrapolation

Spectrum extrapolation is applied to the quantized spectrum prior to
applying the inverse FFT. Spectrum extrapolation consists of amplitude
and phase extrapolation applied to the lost spectral coefficients. The
extrapolated amplitude and phase are combined to form the extrapolated
spectral coefficient. Combining the extrapolated and the received
spectral coefficients is done in order to form quantized spectrum
![](media/image183.wmf){width="0.3888888888888889in" height="0.25in"}.

##### 6.5.1.2.3 Amplitude Extrapolation

Spectral amplitude extrapolation consists of is performed according to
the following steps;

\- Compute the previous frame amplitude spectrum,
![](media/image184.wmf){width="1.3055555555555556in"
height="0.3055555555555556in"}

\- Compute the current frame spectrum,
![](media/image185.wmf){width="0.9027777777777778in"
height="0.3055555555555556in"}

\- Compute the gain difference of energy of non-lost spectral
coefficients between the previous and the current frame\
![](media/image186.wmf){width="1.5694444444444444in"
height="0.8194444444444444in"}

\- Extrapolate the amplitude of the missing spectral coefficients using\
if (*lost\[k\]*) ![](media/image187.wmf){width="1.4305555555555556in"
height="0.2222222222222222in"}

##### 6.5.1.2.4 Phase Extrapolation

![](media/image188.wmf){width="5.888194444444444in"
height="3.4138888888888888in"}

Phase extrapolation uses the principle of group delay conservation for
quasi-stationary signals. First the group delay is estimated on the
previous frame and then used in the current frame in order to
extrapolate the phase on the missing spectral coefficients. The
estimation of the group delay is done by computing

![](media/image189.wmf){width="2.313888888888889in"

### 6.5.2 Stereo

The stereo error concealment is controlled by the bad frame indicators
*bfi*~k~ , k = 0...3. In response to the bad frame indicators of the
present super frame together with some bad frame indicator history
proper actions are taken mitigating the perceptual impact of bad frames.
Particular error mitigation actions are taken on the stereo low-band,
the mid-band, and the high-band.

#### 6.5.2.1 Low-band

*Balance factor*

The balance factor to be used for the derivation of the side signal is
not available depending on *bfi*~k~ and on the stereo TCX frame length,
i.e. if

*bfi*~k~ = 1, k = 0...3 in case of 256-sample stereo TCX frames,

*bfi*~k~ = 1, k = 0, 2 in case of 512-sample stereo TCX frames, or

*bfi*~k~ = 1, k = 0 in case of 1024-sample stereo TCX frames,

In this case, the balance factor is derived from the balance factor of
the previous stereo TCX frame, however, attenuated by 0.9.

For the case of a future frame loss, the balance factor of the present
stereo TCX frame is stored in a history buffer.

*Side signal error signal*

The side signal error signal is derived using the TCX decoder and the
associated bad frame concealment described above (6.6.1.3). Input to the
TCX bad frame concealment is a flag, signalling if any of the frames
associated with the present stereo TCX frame is bad.

*Side signal*

Stereo TCX frames of size 512 samples and 1024 samples are reconstructed
as in the case without bad frames, however using the balance factor and
side signal error signal derived as specified above.

Bad stereo TCX frames of size 256 samples are, however, reconstructed
differently. A parametric model with transfer function

![](media/image195.wmf){width="1.3194444444444444in"
height="0.4722222222222222in"}, *P*=8

is applied to the windowed mono signal for reconstructing a substitution
signal for the side signal. The filter coefficients are taken from a
state memory and are always derived during preceding stereo TCX frames
if the associated *bfi*~k~ flags are equal to zero. The coefficients are
calculated by solving the following equation system:

![](media/image196.wmf){width="0.875in" height="0.2777777777777778in"},

where ![](media/image197.wmf){width="0.3194444444444444in"
height="0.2777777777777778in"} is a Toeplitz matrix of autocorrelations
*r~mm~* of the windowed mono signal:

![](media/image198.wmf){width="2.263888888888889in"
height="0.2777777777777778in"},

and where ![](media/image199.wmf){width="0.25in"
height="0.2361111111111111in"}is a vector of cross-correlations *r~ms~*
of the windowed mono signal and the side signal*:*

![](media/image200.wmf){width="1.8055555555555556in" height="0.25in"}.

*Left/right signal reconstruction*

The side signal used for left/right signal reconstruction is attenuated
in case of severe frame loss conditions of an estimated frame loss rate
of greater than 1%. Using an estimate
![](media/image201.wmf){width="0.16666666666666666in" height="0.25in"}
of the present average frame loss rate, an attenuation factor α is
derived according to the following formula:

![](media/image202.wmf){width="2.19375in" height="0.25in"},

where, in addition, α is limited to be within the range of 0...1.

Before reconstructing left and right signals, the side signal is
multiplied with factor α.

The average frame loss rate is estimated according to the following
algorithm.

A first estimate *f* is calculated according to

![](media/image203.wmf){width="2.0555555555555554in"
height="0.4861111111111111in"}, *N*=500,

where *w~j~* is a weighting factor defined as

![](media/image204.wmf){width="1.3888888888888888in"
height="0.4305555555555556in"},

and *bfi\_buf* is a buffer comprising the *N* most recent flags
*bfi*~k~.

The final frame loss rate estimate is then obtained by AR-1 filtering:

![](media/image205.wmf){width="1.3611111111111112in" height="0.25in"},

where ![](media/image206.wmf){width="0.20833333333333334in"
height="0.25in"} is the frame loss estimate calculated during processing
of the preceding frame.

#### 6.5.2.2 Mid-band

The mid-band synthesis is performed on every frame. When a frame is lost
the parameters of the mid-band decoder are extrapolated by using the
predictive decoders fed with a zero error signal. This implies that the
error will propagate to few frames which does not impact the overall
quality. The extrapolated parameters are the filter coefficients and the
channel gains and are computed as:

![](media/image207.wmf){width="2.736111111111111in" height="0.75in"}

6.6 Output signal generation
----------------------------

The decoder output signal(s) are generated by combining the low and high
band signal to produce full band signals. This operation is the inverse
of the encoder band-splitting operation described in section 5.1. The
following figure shows how the operation is performed.

![](media/image208.wmf){width="4.749305555555556in" height="1.2125in"}

The exact same filters used in the encoder are re-used in the decoder.
Furthermore, if the desired output sampling rate is different from the
internal sampling rate, then a resampling operation is preformed which
is the reverse operation of that performed in the encoder.

7 Detailed bit allocation of the Extended AMR-WB codec
======================================================

The detailed allocation of the bits in the AMR-WB+ audio encoder is
shown for each frame type in tables 14-17 for mono and tables 18-20 for
stereo. These tables show the order of the bits produced by the audio
encoder. Note that the most significant bit (MSB) of each codec
parameter is always sent first. For TCX512 frames, the frame is split in
two equal packets. For TCX1024 frames, the frame is split in four equal
packets. The splitting of TCX512 and TCX1024 frames in several packets
is explained in Section 5.6.1.

8 Storage and Transport Interface formats
=========================================

The AMR-WB+ codec storage and transport interface formats are described
in this section.

8.1 Available Modes and Bitrates
--------------------------------

The AMR-WB+ format contains the AMR-WB modes and a set of AMR-WB+
extension modes.

The AMR-WB+ codec includes the AMR-WB modes, as shown in Table 21 below.

Table 21: AMR-WB+ modes.

There are four special extension modes (Index 10-13 in table 21) that
have a fixed internal sampling frequency (25600 Hz) and audio input
frequencies (16 or 24 kHz). These modes share the property with the
AMR-WB modes that each frame is only capable of representing 20 ms.

Besides the AMR-WB+ operation according to the modes specified in table
21, AMR-WB+ operation is specified by three parameters: mono bit-rate as
given in Table 22, stereo bit-rate as given in Table 23, and internal
sampling frequency (ISF) as given in Table 24.

It is to be noted that the number of samples each frame corresponds to
is always the same but the duration of each frame varies depending on
the internal sampling frequency. There is no preferred sampling
frequency for the codec to operate at, but in order to limit the
possible settings for an effective transmission, the format supports the
sampling frequencies given in Table 24. . Herein, index 0 is used for
AMR-WB and the 4 extension modes of Table 21.

The bit-rate will be dependent on the internal sampling frequency. The
last column of Table 24 indicates which multiplication factor, any
bit-rate value for 25600 Hz internal sampling factor should be converted
with. The ISF index is carried in the bitstream format to indicate which
internal sampling frequency is used for each AMR-WB+ encoded frame.

The frame type is used to identify the content of an AMR-WB+ encoded
frame. This type indicates if it is; an AMR-WB mode, Comfort noise,
NO\_DATA, AMR-WB+ core mode in mono usage, or a combination of a core
mode and a stereo mode. The frame types are presented in Table 25 below.
The core mode and stereo mode index values are according to Table 22 and
23 respectively. The bit-rate value assumes an internal sampling
frequency of 25600 Hz.

internal sampling frequency.

8.2 AMR-WB+ Transport Interface Format
--------------------------------------

The transport interface format serves as an intermediate interface to
the transport format. The transport interface frame contains a two-octet
header followed by data octets.

The header in each frame contains the following two octets.

  ----------- ------- ----------------- ------------------- ------- ------- ------- ------- -------
              MSB                       LSB

  ----------- ------- ----------------- ------------------- ------- ------- ------- ------- -------

**Frame type** (FT) (7 bits): Indicates the frame type setting of the
codec used for the corresponding frame (the combination of AMR-WB+ core
and stereo mode, the AMR-WB mode, or comfort noise, as specified by
Table 25 above).

**Transport Frame Index (TFI)** (2 bits): An index from 0 (first) to 3
(last) indicating this transport frame\'s position in the superframe.

**ISF index** (5 bits): Indicates the internal sampling frequency
employed for the corresponding frame. The index values correspond to
internal sampling frequency as specified in Table 24 above. This field
SHALL be set to 0 for operation according to the AMR-WB+ modes defined
in table 21 (Frame types 0-13).

FT=14 (AUDIO\_LOST) is used to indicate frames that are lost. NO\_DATA
(FT=15) frame could mean either that there is no data produced by the
audio encoder for that frame or that no data for that frame is
transmitted in the current packet (i.e., valid data for that frame could
be sent in either an earlier or later packet). The duration for these
non-included frames is dependent on the internal sampling frequency
indicated by the ISF mode field.

For operation according to FT 0-13 the ISF field shall be set 0 and has
no meaning. The frame length for that operation is fixed to 20 ms in
time.

If receiving a frame with an FT value not defined the whole frame SHOULD
be discarded and assumed erased.

The AMR-WB+ SCR/DTX is identical with AMR-WB SCR/DTX described in \[8\]
and SHALL only be used in combination with the AMR-WB modes (0-8).

The audio data follows the header octets. The number of data octets per
frame corresponding to a certain frame type is given in Table 25.

***Example***

The following diagram (Table 26) shows a frame of AMR-WB+ using 14
kbit/s frame type (FT=26) with a frame length of 35 octets (280 bits).
The internal sampling frequency in this example is 25.6 kHz (ISF mode =
8). FT 26 corresponds to mono mode 0 (208 bits/frame) and stereo mode 4
(72 bits/frame). The frame is the first frame in the superframe (TFI=0).

The data octets are placed according to the detailed bit allocation
given in tables 14 to 20. The first bit of the AMR-WB+ data b0 is placed
in bit 8 of octet 3.

8.3 AMR-WB+ File Storage Format
-------------------------------

This format is relevant only for file storage and defines a storage unit
contained in an AMR-WB+ sample of a 3GP file \[9\]. It is quite similar
to transport interface format with the exception that the two-octet
header is used once per superframe for AMR-WB+ extension modes and once
per frame for AMR-WB modes. Note that in AMR-WB+, the operation code and
internal sampling frequency can be switched only on a superframe basis
boundaries so the header octets are needed only once per superframe.

All media streams in a 3GP file are stored in timed units called
samples. This format defines the syntax of the basic component of a
sample, which is here called a storage unit..

A storage unit consists of a two-octet header followed by data octets
corresponding to either:

1\) A whole superframe (4 transport frames) when FT = 10..13 or OC =
16...47 .

2\) A frame otherwise

For the first case, the number of data octets per superframe is given by
4 times the number of octets per frame (the right-most column in Table
25).

The length of an AMR-WB+ storage unit in ms (corresponding to one
superframe) depends on the internal sample frequency and given by
80×ISF/25600 where ISF is the internal sampling frequency in Hz (ISF
modes are shown in Table 24).

The header in each storage unit contains the following two octets.

  ----------- ------- --------------------- ------- ------------------- ------- ------- ------- -------
              MSB                           LSB                                                 
  **Octet**   bit 8   bit 7                 bit 6   bit 5               bit 4   bit 3   bit 2   bit 1
  **1**       0       Frame type (7 bits)                                                       
  **2**       0       0                     0       ISF mode (5 bits)                           
  ----------- ------- --------------------- ------- ------------------- ------- ------- ------- -------

**Frame type** (FT) (7 bits): Indicates the frame type setting of the
codec used for the corresponding frame (the combination of AMR-WB+ core
and stereo mode, the AMR-WB mode, or comfort noise, as specified by
Table 25 above).

**ISF index** (5 bits): Indicates the internal sampling frequency
employed for the corresponding frame. The index values correspond to
internal sampling frequency as specified in Table 24 above. This field
SHALL be set to 0 for operation according to the AMR-WB+ modes defined
in table 21 (frame types 0-13).

For frame types according to FT 0-13 the ISF field shall be set 0 and
has no meaning. The frame length for that operation is fixed to 20 ms in
time.

The audio data follows the header octets. The number of data octets per
storage unit corresponding to frame types 10..13 and 16...47 are given
as 4 times the number of octets per frame (right-most column in Table
25), for the other frame types, the number of octets are those
corresponding to 1 frame only.

It should be noticed that when FT \<10, i.e. AMR-WB frames, the original
AMR-WB storage format should be preferred in order to ensure backward
decoding compatibility.

***Example***

The following diagram (Table 27) shows a storage sample of AMR-WB+ using
14 kbit/s frame types (FT=26) with a superframe length of 4×35=140
octets. The internal sampling frequency in this example is 25.6 kHz (ISF
mode = 8). FT 26 corresponds to mono mode 0 (208 bits/frame) and stereo
mode 4 (72 bits/frame).

The data octets are packetized according to the detailed bit allocation
given in tables 14 to 20. The first bit of the AMR-WB+ data b0 is placed
in bit 8 of octet 3.
