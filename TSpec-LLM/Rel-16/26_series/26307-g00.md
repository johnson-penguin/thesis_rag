4 Required Mark-up Support
==========================

4.1 Introduction
----------------

The present document defines a 3GPP HTML5 profile for use in 3GPP
services, such as PSS \[2\], MBMS \[3\] and MMS \[5\]. In this clause,
the set of required mark-up and APIs for the 3GPP HTML5 profile is
defined.

The present document defines requirements and recommendations for
Applications and UEs conforming to the 3GPP HTML5 Profile.

4.2 Markup 
----------

The HTML5 \[1\] specification defines conformance requirements for
user-agents and documents:

\- Applications shall comply with conformance requirements for documents
in \[1\].

\- UEs shall comply with conformance requirements for user agents as
defined in \[1\].

4.3 Style
---------

### 4.3.1 Introduction

Support for CSS as a whole is not required by HTML5, even though some
features are defined in terms of specific CSS requirements. This clause
defines requirements for CSS and other style and/or graphic related
technologies.

### 4.3.2 Basic Graphic

\- UEs shall support CSS 2.1 \[9\].

\- UEs shall support CSS Color Module Level 3 \[12\].

\- UEs shall support CSS Image Values and Replaced Content Module Level
3 \[15\].

\- UEs shall support CSS Backgrounds and Borders \[16\].

\- UEs should support CSS Basic User Interface \[14\].

### 4.3.3 Device Adaptation, Layout and Processing

\- UEs should support CSS Media Queries \[17\].

\- UEs should support CSS Flexible Box Layout \[19\].

### 4.3.4 Advanced Graphic

\- UEs shall support the CSS Transforms \[10\].

\- UEs shall support CSS Transitions \[11\].

\- UEs shall support CSS Animations \[18\].

4.4 Scripting
-------------

Scripts are small programs that can be embedded into applications. While
defining features that rely on scripting, HTML5 does not mandate support
for scripting for all user-agents. Furthermore, scripting is defined
using a syntax that in most cases is independent from the underlying
scripting language. For such reasons, the present document has
additional requirements as defined in this clause.

\- UEs shall support scripting as defined in \[1\].

\- UEs shall support ECMA scripting language \[13\].

5 API Support
=============

A number of specifications from W3C or other organizations define APIs
that provide additional functionalities to applications. This clause
lists the specifications that SHALL and SHOULD be supported by a UE.

\- UEs shall support the Forms API \[1\].

\- UEs shall support the Canvas API \[22\].

\- UEs shall support the XMLHttpRequest API \[23\].

\- UEs shall support the Media Source Extensions \[24\].

\- UEs shall support the ISO BMFF Byte Stream Format \[25\] with the
MIME type and subtypes audio/mp4 and video/mp4.

\- UEs should support the GeoLocation API \[21\].

\- UEs should support the Encrypted Media Extensions \[26\].

\- UEs should support the Web Socket API \[8\] with the protocol defined
in RFC 6455 \[28\].

\- UEs should support the Server-Sent Events API \[7\].

\- UEs should support the WebCrypto API \[27\].

6 Service-Specific Aspects
==========================

6.1 Introduction
----------------

Additional requirements and usage restrictions are necessary depending
on the service type that uses the 3GPP HTML5 profile. In this clause,
these aspects are addressed.

6.2 DASH
--------

When an HTML5 presentation uses DASH \[4\] for media streaming, then the
HTML5 presentation may reference one or more DASH presentations through
a reference to the MPD either as a source of an HTML5 media element or
as a reference from one of the referenced resources.

The user agent should support DASH MPD as a supported MIME type for its
source elements and attributes, in which case the DASH playback is done
by the user agent.
