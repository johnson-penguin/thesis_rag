=================

Figure 1 shows a reference model of MCPTT support over UC and BC. The
GCS AS interacts with UE over GC1 interface for application signalling.
The GCS AS determines whether to deliver the audio over UC or BC. GCS AS
interacts with BM-SC over MB2 interface to deliver audio to BM-SC. The
BM-SC delivers the audio over broadcast channel to the UE via SGi-mb
interface. The GCS AS interacts with P-GW over SGi interface to deliver
audio to the UE. The **red** line represents the audio delivered over UC
channel. The **green** line represents the audio delivered over BC
channel.

Note: The UE interacts with the BM-SC using HTTP method via SGi
interface for MBMS Associated Delivery Procedure. Whether the ADP
procedure applies to the MCPTT is TBD.

5 Key Issues for Supporting MCPTT
=================================

5.1 Key Issue\#1: Codec for MCPTT
---------------------------------

### 5.1.1 Review of Codec Alternatives and their Relative Perceptual Performance

#### 5.1.1.1 Overview of the 3GPP Codec Comparison

The EVS Selection and Characterization Phase Test Results provided in
the main body and Annex D of TR 26.952 \[3\] give a detailed assessment
of the performance of the EVS Codec in realistic scenarios compared to
both AMR and AMR-WB. A summary of this comparison is provided in the
next two subclauses.

In the fourth subclause the relative performance of different audio
bandwidths coded with AMR, AMR-WB and EVS is provided showing that the
SWB modes of EVS outperform the WB and NB Primary modes of EVS, AMR-WB
and AMR.

In the fifth subclause, a review of the TETRA codec performance in
comparison to the 3GPP Codecs is provided.

This version of the document includes a review of codec alternatives and
their relative intelligibility in high noise conditions, e.g., at SNRs
in the range of -30 dB to 5 dB. The NTIA report \[16\] covered six noise
types for an intelligibility study that included a range of public
safety and civilian environments. Results of intelligibility testing for
additional public safety specific high noise background conditions are
not included in this document.

#### 5.1.1.2 Narrowband Comparison vs AMR

For Narrowband (NB) signals, four experiments were conducted in the EVS
Selection and four in the EVS Characterization. Taken together, these
results provide a complete picture of the performance of EVS with
respect to AMR but the highlights are provided in Figures 2 to 6 below.

It can be seen that EVS always significantly out-performs AMR in terms
of intrinsic audio quality for both speech and Mixed/Music signals. EVS
is also significantly more robust to frame erasures; both randomly
distributed or according to the Delay and Error profiles from TS 26.114
\[4\] using the EVS JBM.

#### 5.1.1.3 Wideband Comparison vs AMR-WB

For Wideband (WB) signals, seven experiments were conducted during the
EVS Selection and five experiments during Characterization; focused on
determining the performance of the EVS Wideband Primary Modes of
operation. Taken together these experiments provide unique information
about the performance of EVS with respect to AMR-WB but the highlights
are provided below in Figures 7 to 10.

As in the case of AMR and NB, it can be seen that EVS always
significantly out-performs AMR-WB or AMR-WB/G.718IO in terms of
intrinsic audio quality for both speech and Mixed/Music signals. EVS is
also significantly more robust to input level and frame erasures; both
randomly distributed or using the EVS JBM in conjunction with the packet
delay and error profiles taken from either TS 26.114 or the new profiles
defined for LTE.

What is less clear from the frame erasure plots is that AMR-WB, in its
basic form, performs significantly less well than these curves would
suggest. Work in ITU-T as part of the G.718 exercise led to significant
improvements to the packet loss concealment of AMR-WB (G.722.2) and
these improvements are shown in Figures 11 & 12 (FER and BFER); taken
from the Characterization Report of Recommendation ITU-T G.718 \[5\].
The enhancements achieved during the development of G.718 formed part of
the justification of the EVS work item and thus it can be assumed that
EVS will perform even better than suggested by Figures 8, 9 and 10.

#### 5.1.1.4 Super-wideband EVS and Relationships to Other Bandwidths

Three mixed bandwidth tests were performed during the EVS
Characterization and the results are shown in Figure 13.

It is clear from Figure 13 that the Super-wideband (SWB) modes of EVS
outperform the WB modes, which themselves outperform the NB modes. On
the whole it is clear that these trends hold across input types and bit
rates. The EVS codec can also be seen to scale well with bit rate within
each bandwidth and asymptotically approaches the Direct Source (DS) in
the case of SWB and progressively lower value in the cases of the
reduced bandwidth signals; WB and NB.

These mixed bandwidth test results also reinforce the performance
advantages of EVS compared to AMR and AMR-WB.

#### 5.1.1.5 Comparison of the 3GPP Codecs to TETRA

The details of the TETRA codec may be found in ETSI EN 300 395-2 \[6\].
The bit rate of the TETRA codec is 4,567 kbps and it makes use of the
ACELP paradigm and 30ms frames. At the time of its selection in 1993,
the TETRA ACELP codec represented the state-of-the-art in low bit rate
speech codecs and it was well adapted to its specific application and
the TETRA 4:1 TDMA air interface.

According to the Characterization tests conducted during the
standardization of the TETRA ACELP codec which are also provided in
\[6\]:

> *\"For clean speech at a nominal input level of -22 dB the average Q
> value obtained for the TETRA codec is 13,0 dB for the linear input
> condition and 16,5 dB for the IRS input condition. For comparison
> purposes the corresponding values obtained for the Global System for
> Mobile communications (GSM) full-rate codec are 17,4 dB and 18,9 dB
> respectively.\"*

These differences in dBQ are reproduced below (from \[6\]) in Tables 1 &
2 for various input signals.

From Tables 1 & 2 it is clear that the TETRA codec is consistently
inferior to the original GSM Full Rate Speech Codec of the order of 2.4
- 4.4 dBQ.

Since the selection of the TETRA speech coding standard in 1993, firstly
SMG, and latterly 3GPP, has developed several generations of codec
upgrades for NB speech; firstly the Enhanced Full-Rate Codec (EFR), then
the Adaptive Multi-Rate codec (AMR) which included the EFR as the 12.2
kbps mode and most recently the EVS codec. Each of these developments
has provided clear and measurable quality improvements over the
generation that went before.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Figure 14: (Figure 5.4 from \[7\]): AMR Family of Curves for
Experiment 1b (Clean Speech in Half Rate)**

Examining the performance gains of GSM EFR (= AMR 12.2 - ETSI ETR 305 or
GSM 06.55 \[8\]) over the GSM Full Rate Codec it is clear that EFR
significantly outperformed the GSM Full Rate Codec in all tests \[8\]:

> *\"The EFR codec is better than the actual FR codec for clear speech,
> for all error conditions (EP1, EP2 andEP3) and for tandeming under
> error EP1; it is equivalent to G.728 for its intrinsic quality, for
> background noise conditions and talker dependency.\"*

Considering GSM AMR (ETSI TR 126 975 \[7\]), from Figure 14 (Figure 5.4
of \[7\]) it can be seen that all of the AMR coding modes are at least
as good as the GSM Full Rate Codec for clean speech \[7\]. Data is
somewhat lacking on noisy speech performance with AMR in \[7\] but it
can be reasonably expected that In noisy speech, the higher bit rates of
AMR would exceed the performance of GSM FR due to the increasing
similarity with EFR but that the margin would diminish at lower bit
rates. However, all of the bit rates of the AMR modes exceed the 4.567
kbps of TETRA.

It can therefore be confidently concluded that the overall perceptual
quality of the TETRA Codec will be inferior to that of any mode of the
AMR codec.

Such a conclusion is anecdotally supported by the adoption of the AMR
4.75 kbps codec as a codec upgrade to TETRA during the development of
the TETRA-2 feature set.

From the EVS Characterization results in TR 26.952 \[3\] (reproduced in
subclause 5.1.1.2) the comparisons between AMR & EVS show an improvement
for the EVS codec over all of the coding modes of AMR.

It can therefore be confidently concluded that the perceptual quality of
the TETRA Codec is going to be noticeably inferior to any of the EVS NB
codec modes. It is also clear from subclause 5.1.1.4 that AMR-WB and the
WB, SWB and FB modes of EVS are capable of significantly improving not
only the quality, but also the intelligibility, of any MCPTT system when
compared to narrowband communication systems such as TETRA and P25. The
increased intelligibility of the wider audio bandwidths are also
available at bit rates approaching the lower bit rates of AMR with the
EVS codec i.e. EVS Wideband VBR (nominally 5.9 kbps) and 7.2 kbps
compared to AMR 4.75, 5.9, 6.7 and 7.4 kbps. This feature of the EVS
codec simultaneously satisfies the requirements for improved
intelligibility and for radio resource efficiency given in subclauses
5.14, 6.15.5 and 6.15.6 of \[2\].

#### 5.1.1.6 Comparison of Performance over MCPTT Bearers

##### 5.1.1.6.1 \"HD-Voice\" AMR-WB performance over 3GPP networks

The \"HD Voice\" reference describes the quality of experience across
the listed KPIs (speech quality, speech intelligibility, error
resiliency, and call capacity) of AMR-WB in today\'s commercial VoLTE
networks.

For instance AMR-WB at 12.65 kbps operating over a unicast LTE PS
channel with 1% FER per mobile link (as specified for QCI=1) resulting
in 2% total FER in mobile-to-mobile calls.

To characterize the reference coverage in a VoLTE system using unicast
power-controlled channels with HARQ Re-TX and QCI = 1 this document uses
the VoLTE field test results illustrated in figures 5.1.1.6.1-1 and
5.1.1.6.1-2 below. Figure 5.1.1.6.1-2 excludes the zero RTP loss rate
data to allow the reader to see the non-zero cases more clearly.

![](media/image33.jpeg){width="4.8in" height="4.925in"}

Figure 5.1.1.6.1-1 CDF of end-to-end RTP packet loss rate for VoLTE
mobile-to-mobile calls. Zero RTP loss values INCLUDED.

These measurements are based on logs taken over 6000 calls over various
commercial LTE networks spanning multiple continents, with each call
averaging 34 seconds in duration (actually a mix of many short 30s calls
and several hours of long calls). The RTP loss rate is calculated over 1
second windows and includes stationary and mobile UE\'s in good and bad
coverage conditions.

It can that seen that about only about 90% of the cell area has an
end-to-end FER \<=2%. This is interpreted to mean that the reference
\"HD Voice\" coverage is equivalent to 90% of the cell area. In the
remaining 10% the AMR-WB codec speech quality starts to degrade at FERs
above 2%.

Figure 5.1.1.6.1-2 CDF of end-to-end RTP packet loss rate for VoLTE
mobile-to-mobile calls. Zero RTP loss values EXCLUDED.

##### 5.1.1.6.2 MCPTT Bearers

The MCPTT service can be operated over three types of bearers depending
on the network topology that is most appropriate among those available.
The following clauses describe these bearers and also the channel models
used to provide the simulation results in the next clause.

##### 5.1.1.6.2.1 Unicast bearer {#unicast-bearer .H6}

MCPTT can be operated over unicast channels in the same way the
teleconferencing is performed in today\'s mobile networks using a
central conferencing server for duplicating and distributing media
(Figure 5.1.1.6.2.1-1).

Each of the LTE unicast channels is a power-controlled channel that also
use retransmission schemes such as HARQ to provide a target BLER or
packet loss rate to the VoIP frames transmitted over the channel.

Figure 5.1.1.6.2.1-1 MCPTT topology using unicast bearers

When using AMR-WB in this topology, the coverage, error-resiliency,
speech quality, speech intelligibility, and call capacity is equivalent
to that of \"HD Voice.\"

When evaluating the performance of EVS and AMR-WB over the unicast
bearers, the EVS characterization report \[3\] used the delay-loss
profiles defined in \[4\] and introduced additional delay-loss profiles.

##### 5.1.1.6.2.2 MBMS bearer {#mbms-bearer .H6}

When multiple participants in a group are in a single cell the system
can reduce the resources needed to support the users by having them
share a common downlink MBMS bearer. This shared channel has the
following characteristics:

1\) It is not power-controlled. There is no dynamic feedback by which
the eNB can decide to dynamically adjust its transmission resources to
improve error performance or meet a target error rate.

2\) Use of retransmissions is \"blind\" in that the retransmissions are
not sent based on dynamic feedback such as ACK/NACKs. These
retransmissions cannot be used to guarantee a certain level of
performance or target error rate throughout the cell.

Therefore, error rates on the MBMS bearer can vary considerably
throughout the cell, e.g., indoors, basements, elevators, stairwells, or
the edge of cell in an SC-PTM topology (see below).

The topology for using an MBMS bearer can be configured in two ways:

1\) As a Single-Cell Point-to-Multipoint (SC-PTM) bearer where adjacent
cells do not necessarily transmit the same group\'s content on the same
MBMS bearer. In this topology the adjacent cells typically interfere
with the MBMS bearer in the serving cell resulting in poorer coverage
than the MBSFN topology.

2\) As part of a MBSFN, where all the cells are broadcasting the same
content on the same MBMS bearers, preventing inter-cell interference and
allowing the users to combine these transmissions to improve coverage
and reception.

The simulation model used to evaluate the performance of 3GPP speech
codecs over MBMS bearers is described in clause A.1

##### 5.1.1.6.2.3 LTE-D bearer {#lte-d-bearer .H6}

LTE-Direct communication is a broadcast mechanism (no physical layer
feedback) that defines two physical channels, control and data, for
communication between two (or more) UEs. The resources used for direct
communication comprise of control and data resources. For in-network
operation, a control resource pool is provided via RRC signalling while
for off-network operation, the control resource pool is pre-configured.
Further, two modes of resource allocation are supported: Mode 1
(in-network) and Mode 2 (in-network and off-network) as illustrated in
Figure 5.1.1.6.2.3-1.

Figure 5.1.1.6.2.3-1 LTE-D operation

Here, the focus is on Mode 2 (off-network) scenario. In Mode 2, the
transmitting UEs determine the resources to be used for control and data
transmission. UE transmits control to announce resources to be used for
subsequent data transmission. Receiving UEs monitor the control
resources to determine when to wake-up and listen for data transmission.

The performance of LTE-D based on system and link level simulations for
off-network scenario is evaluated. In particular, the mandatory Option 5
hotspot drop has been used for system level simulations.

##### 5.1.1.6.3 AMR-WB and EVS Performance over the MCPTT Bearers

##### 5.1.1.6.3.0 General {#general .H6}

Enhanced Voice Services (EVS) is a new speech codec standard (part of
3GPP Release 12) which offers a wide range of new features and
improvements for low delay real-time communication. The key advancements
fall into three categories namely significantly improved quality for
clean/noisy speech and music content, higher compression efficiency and
unprecedented error resiliency to packet loss and delay jitter
experienced in PS systems. In addition to voice quality and
intelligibility aspects, we present methods on how to utilize some of
the EVS codec advancements to realize MCPTT system level benefits such
as improved coverage and call capacity gains.

###### 5.1.1.6.3.1 EVS Speech Quality

EVS Selection and Characterization Phase Test Results are summarized in
the main body and detailed in Annex D of TR 26.952 \[3\]. In this clause
a few test results are highlighted to quantify the improvements of the
EVS codec along the three dimensions listed above, i.e., speech quality,
compression efficiency, and error resiliency. To further simplify the
performance comparison a reference point for benchmarking is
established, namely AMR-WB at a bit-rate of 12.65 kbps based on
commercial grade HD Voice services available today.

NOTE. The correlation between voice quality and intelligibility is
dependent on the test parameters. In general, improved voice quality may
result in improved intelligibility. However, it is also possible e.g.,
in noisy conditions of \[-30 dB to 5 dB SNR\], that the improvements
observed using subjective voice quality testing and the improvements
observed using subjective intelligibility testing may not correlate
well. In the other end of spectrum, e.g., in clean speech, while the
voice quality may have improved significantly, the intelligibility may
already have approached a level of saturation.

Three mixed bandwidth DCR (Degradation Category Rating) tests were
performed as a part of EVS Characterization testing whose results are
shown in Figure 13.

In general, EVS-WB codec offers quality significantly better than AMR-WB
at a similar bit-rate and quality equivalent to AMR-WB at a lower bit
rate. The EVS-SWB codec performance is significantly better than both
AMR-WB and corresponding bit rates of EVS-WB.

For clean speech content (Figure 13a), the lowest bit-rate of EVS-WB
namely 5.9 kbps can offer quality significantly better than AMR-WB at
8.85 kbps and equivalent to AMR-WB at 12.65 kbps. The subjective quality
of EVS-WB coding starting at 9.6 kbps is significantly better than the
AMR-WB coding at its highest bit rate of 23.85 kbps. The super-wideband
mode of EVS at 13.2 kbps achieves transparency to the direct source and
offers quality significantly better than both 23.85 kbps of AMR-WB and
24.4 kbps of EVS-WB.

For noisy speech (Figure 13b), EVS-WB at 9.6 kbps offers quality on par
with AMR-WB at 12.65 kbps. This has also been shown across different
languages/noise types and summarized in TR 26.952. However, none of the
noisy speech tests included the presence of a front end noise
suppression, which is expected to establish the equivalence to AMR-WB
12.65 kbps quality at a bit-rate lower than 9.6 kbps by providing a
higher SNR at the input to the coder. EVS-WB at 13.2 kbps offers quality
on par with AMR-WB at approximately twice the bit-rate with consistent
progression in subjective quality with increasing bit-rates. The
subjective quality of EVS-SWB coding at 13.2 kbps is significantly
better than that of AMR-WB at 23.85 kbps and EVS-WB at the same
bit-rate.

For mixed/music coding (Figure 13c, 13d) under clean channel conditions,
both the EVS-WB and SWB codec starting at 13.2 kbps achieves subjective
quality that is significantly better than that of AMR-WB at any
bit-rate. For North American English music and mixed content (Figure
13d), EVS-SWB coding performs significantly better than EVS-WB at the
same bit rate.

Figure 5.1.1.6.3.1-1: EVS-SWB Channel aware mode clean speech
performance under clean and impaired channels (Mixed bandwidth DCR
Test), (a) Danish, (b) North American English

Figure 5.1.1.6.3.1-1 shows the EVS-SWB channel aware mode performance at
13.2 kbps under clean channel as well as under five different delay/loss
profiles (Profiles 5, 7, 8, 9, and 10) which simulate impaired channel
characteristic with varying delay and jitter. Profile 5 is a MTSI delay
loss profile from TS 26.114 \[4\] and profiles 8-10 are VoLTE delay loss
profile used for characterization testing of EVS channel aware mode
\[http://www.3gpp.org/ftp/tsg\_sa/WG4\_CODEC/EVS\_Permanent\_Documents/EVS-7c\_S4-141392.zip\]

Most 3GPP networks are expected to be configured such that the FER is
around 1% for each link. While the 2% data point was not tested in this
test, comparisons were made between the EVS modes versus AMR-WB at the
nearest data points namely, 0% (clean channel) and 3% FER.

In general, the 13.2 kbps EVS-SWB clean speech performance under
impaired channel with channel aware mode enabled is significantly better
than without channel aware mode which in turn is significantly better
than AMR-WB at its highest bit-rate of 23.85 kbps. For both languages,
the quality of EVS SWB 13.2 kbps channel aware and non-channel aware
modes in clean channel are significantly better than AMR-WB at its
highest bit-rate of 23.85 kbps.

For North American English (Figure 5.1.1.6.3.1-1b), EVS SWB 13.2 kbps
channel aware mode operating at around 6% FER delivers quality on par
with that of the highest bit-rate of AMR-WB (23.85 kbps) under no loss.
The 13.2 kbps SWB non-channel aware mode is able to achieve the quality
equivalence to AMR-WB 23.85 clean channel when operating at around 3%
FER. EVS 13.2 kbps channel aware mode even at 10% FER delivers quality
better than AMR-WB 23.85 kbps at 3% FER, while the 13.2 kbps EVS SWB
non-channel aware mode can operate at 8% FER but achieve quality
equivalence to AMR-WB 23.85 kbps at 3% FER.

For Danish (Figure 5.1.1.6.3.1-1a), EVS SWB 13.2 kbps channel aware mode
operating at around 3% FER delivers quality on par with that of the
highest bit-rate of AMR-WB (23.85 kbps) under no loss. EVS 13.2 kbps
channel aware mode even at 10% FER delivers quality equivalent to AMR-WB
23.85 kbps at 3% FER, while the 13.2 kbps EVS SWB non-channel aware mode
can operate at 6% FER to achieve quality equivalence to AMR-WB 23.85
kbps at 3% FER.

Figure 5.1.1.6.3.1-2: EVS-SWB Channel aware mode noisy speech
performance under clean and impaired channels (North American English

In general, the 13.2 kbps EVS-SWB noisy speech performance under
impaired channel with channel aware mode enabled is significantly better
than without channel aware mode which in turn is significantly better
than AMR-WB at its highest bit-rate of 23.85 kbps.

For North American English with car noise at 15 dB SNR, EVS SWB 13.2
kbps channel aware mode operating at 10% FER and the EVS SWB non-channel
aware mode operating at 6% FER can achieve quality equivalence to AMR-WB
23.85 kbps at 3% FER.

under clean and impaired channels (Single bandwidth ACR test
--Experiment W1 from EVS Characterization Testing) (a) North American
English, (b) Mandarin

For North American English (Figure 5.1.1.6.3.1-3a), the 13.2 kbps EVS-WB
clean speech performance under impaired channel with channel aware mode
enabled is significantly better than without channel aware mode which in
turn is significantly better than AMR-WB at 15.85 kbps. The quality of
EVS WB 13.2 kbps channel aware and non-channel aware modes in clean
channel are significantly better than AMR-WB at 15.85 kbps.

Specifically, it can be seen that for both languages tested, the EVS
13.2 kbps channel aware mode operating at 10% FER can deliver quality on
par with AMR-WB at 15.85 kbps at 3% FER. In addition, the 13.2 kbps
non-channel aware mode can operate at 6% FER to achieve equivalence to
AMR-WB 15.85 kbps at 3% FER.

Since AMR-WB 12.65 kbps at 2% FER (\"HD Voice\" center of cell speech
quality) quality benchmark was not included in the tests summarizes in
Figures 5.1.1.6.3.1-3a and 5.1.1.6.3.1-3b, the source used P.OLQA to
determine the frame error rate at which the 13.2 kbps EVS WB channel
aware and non-channel aware modes is equal to the \"HD Voice\" reference
speech quality.

The source presents below the result of a study to characterize the
correlation between subjective MOS and P.OLQA \[10\] for the North
American English Absolute Category Rating (ACR) MOS test results shown
in Figure 5.1.1.6.3.1-3a. A North American English database comprising
of 3 male and 3 female talkers with 5 sentence pairs per talker was used
for computing the P.OLQA scores. The sentence pair wise scores for each
condition was averaged to obtain a single P.OLQA score for the
condition.

NOTE. As per \[12\], POLQA has been tested to work with background noise
levels. A fixed lower SNR limit at which POLQA can be applied was not
reported in \[12\] and it was noted that it is highly signal-dependent.
POLQA analysis in this Clause is done on clean speech in clean and noisy
channel conditions. POLQA analysis for extreme noisy conditions \[10 to
-5 dB\] is not performed.

To study the correlation between the POLQA and subjective MOS, the
relationship between the two sre plotted in Figure 5.1.1.6.3.1-4. The
data points in this plot include the subjective MOS scores from Figure
5.1.1.6.3.1-3a and POLQA scores computed as described above. The data
points used for this plot include all conditions (clean channel and all
delay loss profiles tested) of AMR-WB 15.85 kbps, EVS-WB 13.2 kbps
non-channel aware and channel aware modes (a plot showing the
correlation with the channel and non-channel aware modes separated is
provided in clause A.2 of the Annex). The \"Linear (AMR-WB)\" line
represents the linear regression between AMR-WB MOS and the
corresponding POLQA scores. Therefore, assuming that the \"Linear
(AMR-WB)\" represents the true relationship between POLQA and subjective
MOS, then it is seen that POLQA underestimates the subjective quality of
EVS WB 13.2 kbps modes.

12.65 kbps at 2% FER. The corresponding data point for the non-channel
aware mode is 4% FER. The 3, 6, 8 and 10% FER data points (anchors)
shown on the X-axis in Figure 4.1.6 were simulated via delay loss
profiles 7, 8, 9 and 10 respectively (used in ACR MOS results shown in
Figure 4.1.4a). Delay loss profiles to simulate the other FER data
points were created as a random subset of the nearest highest FER
anchor. For example the 1 and 2% FER profiles were created as a subset
of delay loss profile 7 (3% FER).

Taking into account the under estimation observed in Figure
5.1.1.6.3.1-4 and results from the subjective MOS tests shown in Figure
5.1.1.6.3.1-3a and 5.1.1.6.3.1-3b, it can be seen that the above
determination of frame error rate for EVS-WB 13.2 kbps channel aware and
non-channel aware modes to achieve the same speech quality as AMR-WB
12.65 kbps at 2% FER, is conservative. The respective SWB modes will
provide significantly improved voice quality as compared to the 13.2
kbps WB modes which will result in even higher frame error rates than
what is determined above for the WB modes.

###### 5.1.1.6.3.2 Unicast bearer

**Speech quality:** Power controlled LTE unicast channels are typically
configured to operate at a target BLER of 1% per link. The results
presented in clause 5.1.1.6.3.1 show that EVS WB at 13.2 kbps (channel
aware or non-channel aware) can offer significant quality improvement
over \"HD Voice\" quality. Furthermore the EVS-SWB mode operating at
13.2 kbps (channel aware and non channel aware) offers significantly
better audio quality than EVS-WB at the same bit-rate. This applies to a
wide range of input signals which include clean speech, speech with
background noise and mixed/music content.

**Speech intelligibility:** EVS offers significant voice quality
improvement over AMR-WB (HD voice). The improved robustness to
background noise and resiliency to errors are particularly relevant to
MCPTT service. In clean channel conditions, as observed in the NTIA
report \[16\] for the very low SNR conditions in the range of \[10 to -5
dB\], the intelligibility performance of EVS FB codec is equivalent or
better than that of AMR-WB (HD voice). Intelligibility in channel errors
is not evaluated and is for further study.

**Error resiliency and Coverage:** Although retransmission schemes such
as HARQ maybe used for tight control of the target BLER, due to the
power limited uplink, the cell edge or deep indoors may still experience
higher BLER (\>1%). As seen in clause 5.1.1.6.3.1, under these
conditions the EVS WB and SWB channel aware mode will offer
significantly better speech quality than AMR-WB at 12.65 kbps due to
improved error resiliency. It can be appreciated that the EVS WB channel
aware mode at 13.2 kbps can tolerate up to 8% FER and still deliver the
same speech quality as AMR-WB 12.65 kbps operating at 2% FER which is
center of the cell \"HD Voice\" speech quality. The ability to sustain
the link while tolerating higher path loss results in improved link
budget/coverage. The EVS SWB channel aware mode at 13.2 kbps can
tolerate even higher FER (up to 10%) for further extending coverage
while maintain HD Voice center of cell speech quality. The 13.2 kbps EVS
WB and SWB non-channel aware modes can also operate at higher FER(4% for
WB non-channel aware mode as shown in clause 4.1) and deliver \"HD
Voice\" center of cell speech quality thereby resulting in improved
coverage, albeit lower than that of the channel aware mode.

**Call capacity:** The 13.2 kbps EVS modes utilize the same transport
block size as AMR-WB 12.65 kbps. This results in the same cell site
voice capacity as AMR-WB 12.65 kbps. If coverage is kept a constant, the
improved error resiliency can be utilized for capacity gains by
increasing the packet loss rate by not transmitting the packet at the UE
itself. The power at which each packet is transmitted would not be
lowered but this mechanism can result in power savings at the UE due to
reduced ON time or reduced number of transmissions (analogous to DTX or
blanking but for active speech). Incorporating this into the scheduler
can reduce the average number of resource blocks required thereby
freeing up resources either to add more users or for best effort
traffic. The capacity gains are directly proportional to the maximum FER
rate at which the EVS mode can still maintain HD voice centre of cell
voice quality. Correlating to speech quality discussed in clause
5.1.1.6.3.1, at 13.2 kbps the EVS SWB channel aware mode would offer the
highest capacity gains followed by EVS WB channel aware, EVS SWB and WB
non-channel aware modes. For example, reducing ON time by 10% (i.e.
blanking 10% of the active frame vocoder packets) when operating in EVS
SWB channel aware mode can result in 18% capacity gains measured in
terms of number of additional users per cell site.

The lower bit-rates of EVS namely the 5.9 VBR and 7.2 kbps WB modes can
offer significant cell site voice capacity improvements due to utilizing
smaller transport block sizes/resource blocks. It has been demonstrated
that the EVS VBR 5.9 mode can achieve 41% more capacity than AMR 12.2,
which has the same capacity as AMR-WB 12.65. EVS 7.2 kbps can offer 35%
more capacity than AMR 12.65 kbps. Correlating to speech quality results
discussed in clause 5.1.1.6.3.1, it can be seen that this significant
capacity gain improvement is achieved while maintaining \"HD Voice\"
speech quality.

###### 5.1.1.6.3.3 MBMS bearer

The simulation results in this clause demonstrate EVS and AMR-WB
performance on the downlink MBMS bearer and compare this to the
reference. The error conditions and scheduler assumptions considered in
the MBMS downlink bearer in these simulations, including the definition
of Case 1 and Case2, are detailed in clause A.1. The results provided
are the output of simulations conducted by one source company using the
models described in clause A.1.

Figures 5.1.1.6.3.3-1 (Superwideband) and 5.1.1.6.3.3-2 (Wideband) show
speech quality comparison of EVS vs AMR-WB for Case 1. Simulated error
conditions in the downlink MBMS bearer channel is given in Table
A.1.3-1. In all MBMS bearer scenarios considered, EVS significantly
outperforms AMR-WB in terms of voice quality.

Figure 5.1.1.6.3.3-2: P.OLQA scores for Case 1 -- Wideband Speech

Figures 5.1.1.6.3.2-3 and 5.1.1.6.3.2-4 show speech quality for Case 2
described in clause A.1.3. Total uplink and network error levels of 1%
FER are considered with various MBMS bearer conditions in the downlink
with 40ms scheduling at eNB, and de-jitter buffering at the receiving
MCPTT UE.

AMR-WB is unable to meet the reference error resilience, speech quality,
and speech intelligibility in all scenarios except for the 1% FER cases.
EVS meets or exceeds these reference KPIs in most cases. In addition,
both EVS wideband and superwideband modes offer notable improvement in
voice quality over AMR-WB under various error conditions considered
here.

In certain cases (e.g. v120\_b5\_4 profile in Figure 5.1.1.6.3.2-3) the
improvement in P.OLQA scores by EVS over AMR-WB is 0.65, while AMR-WB
yield low P.OLQA scores around 2.84. This may translate into scenarios
where an end user may not understand certain portions of speech with
AMR-WB under certain FER conditions in the MBMS coverage area, while EVS
would provide clear and meaningful speech.

In most test cases considered under Case 1 and Case 2 above, AMR-WB is
unable to meet the reference \"HD Voice\" quality as it suffers from a
significant reduction in voice quality during channel errors. From a
coverage perspective, this would be experienced as significant
degradation in voice quality in areas exhibiting above channel
characteristics with errors. Above results also demonstrate how the EVS
can compensate for errors significantly better than AMR-WB. Note that
the improvement of speech quality over AMRWB offered by EVS Channel
Aware mode increases, when more errors are present in the downlink MBMS
bearer channel.

**Error resiliency, Speech Quality, and Speech Intelligibility:**

The results in this clause show that EVS can withstand MBMS channel
errors much better than AMR-WB. With increasing error rates in the MBMS
downlink, AMR-WB speech quality degrades at a faster pace, while EVS is
able to maintain a reasonable level of speech quality.

In all of the MBMS bearer scenarios, with the exception of FERs \>= 3%
in Case 2 wideband, the EVS channel-aware mode is able to meet or exceed
the performance of the reference error resiliency, speech quality, and
speech intelligibility.

In most of the MBMS bearer scenarios (FER\<4% for SWB and FER\<3% for
WB), EVS non-channel aware mode is able to meet or exceed the
performance of the reference.

In all the cases where EVS non-channel aware mode cannot meet the
reference, it significantly outperforms AMR-WB. AMR-WB fails to meet the
reference in all scenarios except for the 1% FER cases.

**Coverage:**

Figures 5.1.1.6.3.3-1, 5.1.1.6.3.3-2, 5.1.1.6.3.3-3, and 5.1.1.6.3.3-4
show that EVS channel aware and non-channel aware modes provide
significantly better and better coverage than AMR-WB, respectively, due
to their ability to handle higher FERs with less degradation in voice
quality.

The simulations discussed in clause A.1.1 demonstrated that less than
95% of the cell coverage area can support FER \<=1% on the MBMS bearer
downlink in SC-PTM when two rings of adjacent cells are only
transmitting at 50% interference. Unfortunately, it was not possible to
generate more simulation results showing exactly how much cell coverage
area provides \<=1% FER and how much provides \<=5% FER using SC-PTM.

However, it is expected that relaxing the FER target to 5% in the
simulations will improve the coverage enough to cover at least 90% of
the cell and thus demonstrate that EVS channel aware mode operated over
the SC-PTM in the simulated conditions can at least meet the reference
coverage.

A comparison of MBMS MBSFN coverage to the reference was not provided as
the source did not have simulations that could be used for this
analysis.

**Call Capacity:**

It is not possible to make a reasonable comparison of the capacity of an
MBMS bearer with the capacity of an HD Voice unicast bearer system. For
example, the number of users supported by the MBMS bearer could be very
high when there\'s a very dense concentration of listeners near the
center of the cell.

Nevertheless, the following observations and statements can be made
regarding MBMS capacity.

When operating EVS at 13.2 kbps it consumes the same MBMS bearer
resources as AMR-WB 12.65kbps. However, due to the higher
error-resiliency of EVS, the number of EVS users that can receive the
MBMS speech traffic intelligibly is greater than that of AMR-WB users.
Therefore EVS provides better call capacity than AMR-WB.

The EVS VBR mode with a lower average rate of 5.9kbps, which provides
the same voice quality as AMR-WB 12.65, can also provide an improvement
in capacity by using less of the MBMS bearer resources. This would allow
the MBMS bearer to carry concurrently more speech streams of EVS VBR
than AMR-WB.

###### 5.1.1.6.3.4 LTE-D bearer

In order to study and quantify potential coverage (range extension) and
power savings benefits of EVS as compared to AMR-WB, the following
parameters of RAN1 VoIP traffic model for D2D group broadcast were
adapted to reflect EVS codec modes and characteristics.

\- Number of Bytes every 20 ms

\- ON time -- Markov chain modelling for ON-OFF to transition.

\- Outage criteria or BLER target

\- All other parameters were kept the same,

Gains to KPIs such as link budget/coverage and fraction of successful
links can be realized by either relaxation of target BLER requirements
(possible due to the EVS codec\'s improved error resiliency) or via
lower bit-rates (utilizing the EVS codec\'s improved efficiency). The
results provided are the output of simulations conducted by one source
company.

The EVS bit-rates and operating FER rates (BLER target) summarized in
Table 5.1.1.6.3.3-1 were chosen for RAN1 LTE-D link budget and system
simulations. It is important to note each of these EVS configurations
provide equivalent speech quality to AMR-WB at 12.65 kbps under 2% FER
(\"HD Voice center of cell experience), i.e. speech quality has been
equalized to this benchmark for purpose of quantifying KPI improvements
offered by the EVS modes. In-depth details on audio quality are provided
in clause 5.1.1.6.3.1.

Activity Factor on encoding using the AMR-12.2 kbps or AMR-WB 12.65 kbps
codec (used in current VoIP traffic model) is 75%. Note that EVS Voice

kbps.

The amount of gain in coverage will depend on the scenario. An exponent
of 4 in path loss (used for O2O LOS and NLOS) was assumed in translation
of link budget gains to coverage gain (distance and area).

**Power Consumption comparison of EVS modes to AMR/AMR-WB**

Table 5.1.1.6.3.4-3 summarizes the transmit (TX) and receive (RX) side
power gains offered by the EVS modes. For the 13.2 kbps channel aware
mode Option 2, it is assumed that the RX on time is not reduced as the
receiver would keep decoding in the absence of information regarding
number of packets being sent (as per Rel-12).

AMR/AMR-WB and the different EVS modes. Capacity is measured in terms of
the fraction of successful links, i.e. the fraction of links where
fraction of packets missed by a link \<=Target BLER.

The system level simulation to study capacity gains of the EVS modes
over AMR/AMR-WB was repeated after increasing the number of TX from 3 to
4 per cell. As shown in Table 5.1.1.6.3.4-5, this results in a lower
fraction of successful links (RX side) when compared to the
corresponding entry in Table 5.1.1.6.3.4-4, but results in higher gains
when TX and RX are combined.

**Error Resiliency and Coverage:**

EVS 13.2 kbps channel aware mode (Option 1) offers the highest gain
(over AMR 12.2kbps/AMR-WB 12.65 kbps) in terms of link budget (2.8 dB)
and coverage (17% gain in distance and 38% gain in area) followed by the
13.2 kbps non channel aware mode (Option 1) and 5.9 VBR/7.2/8 kbps low
bit-rate WB modes.

As seen in Figure 5.1.1.6.3.4-2, for AMR-WB 12.65 kbps case (red curve),
only 80% of links have BLER \<= 2% i.e. are at HD-Voice center of cell
speech quality. The 20% of links where BLER \>2% may be classified as
regions of bad coverage which will experience significantly lower speech
quality than the center of the cell. With EVS 13.2 kbps channel aware
mode (Option 1) or non-channel aware mode (Option 1), the fraction of
links which will experience \"HD Voice\" center of cell speech quality,
increases to 96% or 89% respectively which roughly speaking brings EVS
over LTE-D coverage closer to that of the reference \"HD-Voice\"
coverage. The respective SWB modes will further increase the fraction of
links which experience \"HD Voice\" center of cell speech quality.

**Speech Quality and Intelligibility:**

EVS offers significantly improved voice quality over \"HD Voice\" center
of cell experience for 80% of links which experience BLER \<=2% (Figure
5.1.1.6.3.4-2). The conclusions drawn in clause 5.1.1.6.3.2 (Speech
Quality and Intelligibility on LTE unicast bearer) also apply to this
scenario. Techniques described in this paper such as increasing the
target BLER or lowering of bit-rate can be applied to AMR-WB to realize
range/coverage extension. However this will result in significantly
degraded speech quality and intelligibility failing the \"HD Voice\"
quality requirement.

Power Consumption: The EVS modes offer power consumption gains over
AMR/AMR-WB due reduced ON time. The 13.2 kbps EVS channel aware mode
(Option 2) can achieve 8.5% reduction in the ON time when compared to
AMR/AMR-WB, which translates to 11% TX Power gain followed by the
non-channel aware mode (Option 2), channel aware/non-channel aware modes
(Option 1) and 5.9 VBR/7.2/8 kbps low bit-rate WB modes.

**Fraction of successful links (Call Capacity):**

It is not possible to make a reasonable comparison of the capacity of an
LTE-D bearer with the capacity of an HD Voice unicast bearer system. For
example, the capacity of LTE-D could be very high when there\'s a very
dense concentration of listeners near the talker.

Nevertheless, the following observations and statements can be made
regarding LTE-D capacity.

The EVS 13.2 kbps channel aware mode (Option 1) offers the highest gain
in fraction of successful links followed by the non-channel aware mode
(Option1) and channel aware mode Option 2/5.9 VBR/7.2/8 kbps low
bit-rate WB modes. The ability of EVS, especially in channel-aware mode,
to support another transmitter without causing as severe interference to
EVS listeners as to AMR-WB listeners in the cell is very relevant in
that it allows the cell to support another MCPTT group. This is
essentially increasing capacity for the cell to support MCPTT groups by
33% (from 3 to 4) which could be critical in disaster situations where
multiple public safety groups (e.g., police, fire-fighters, medical,
hazardous materials teams) may be operating concurrently in a particular
cell.

The target BLER operating points in Table 5.1.1.6.3.3-1 for the 13.2
kbps EVS channel aware and non-channel aware modes were determined for
the WB modes and were based on speech quality results presented in
clause 5.1.1.6.3.1. The 13.2 kbps SWB channel aware and non-channel
aware modes will provide significantly better quality than the
corresponding WB modes. Alternatively, the improvement in voice quality
by going to SWB, can be used to further relax the target BLER
requirement or reduce the ON time which will translate to even further
gains to the corresponding KPIs (coverage, fraction of successful links
or power consumption)

##### 5.1.1.6.4 Conclusions

Coverage:

\- EVS exceeds the reference coverage for unicast and LTE-D bearers.

\- EVS exceeds the coverage of AMR-WB over MBMS SC-PTM bearers.
Furthermore, it is expected that EVS should meet, if not exceed, the
reference coverage for MBMS SC-PTM bearers.

\- AMR-WB meets the reference coverage for unicast bearers

\- AMR-WB does not meet the reference coverage for LTE-D bearers.

\- Based on the analysis in Clause 5.1.1.6.3.3, AMR-WB does not appear
to meet the reference coverage for MBMS SC-PTM bearers.

The simulations shows the coverage improvement benefits using EVS Codec
for the unicast and MBMS bearers. Coverage may be improved by deploying
more infrastructure, including emergency deployments (e.g. cells on
wheels). In this case, the EVS channel aware mode will still provide
improved coverage benefits relative to AMR-WB, however, the relative
benefit in coverage may need to be re-evaluated.

Speech Quality/Error-resiliency:

\- When the MCPTT bearer channel conditions are similar to that of the
reference (end-to-end FER \<=2%), EVS provides better speech quality
than the reference. When the channel conditions get worse, EVS can
maintain the same speech quality as the reference for all the MCPTT
bearers due to its improved error resiliency.

\- AMR-WB is able to provide the reference error-resiliency/speech
quality over the unicast bearer.

\- AMR-WB is unable to provide the reference error-resiliency/speech
quality for both the MBMS SC-PTM and LTE-D bearers.

In this report, the subjective MOS evaluations from 3GPP TS 26.952
contained both clean speech and noise while the POLQA evaluations are
based on a clean speech database.

Speech Intelligibility:

\- EVS offers significant voice quality improvements over the reference.
The improved robustness to background noise and resiliency to errors are
particularly relevant to the MCPTT service and in general is expected to
result in equal or better speech intelligibly compared to the reference.

\- AMR-WB meets the reference speech intelligibility for unicast
bearers.

\- AMR-WB does not meet the reference speech intelligibility for LTE-D
bearers.

\- Based on the analysis in Clause 5.1.1.6.3.3, AMR-WB does not appear
to meet the reference speech intelligibility for MBMS SC-PTM bearers.

Call Capacity:

\- EVS exceeds the reference capacity for unicast bearers.

\- AMR-WB meets the reference capacity for unicast bearers.

\- For LTE-D and MBMS (SC-PTM and MBSFN) bearers, it is not possible to
make a relevant comparison to the reference capacity. However EVS
provides better capacity than AMR-WB for all of these MCPTT bearers.

In summary:

\- In summary, in the cases where the KPIs and MCPTT bearers allow a
comparison to the reference \"HD Voice\" experience, EVS meets or
exceeds (or is expected to at least meet in the case of MBMS SC-PTM
coverage) the performance of the reference for all the bearers. For the
LTE-D bearers, AMR-WB does not meet the reference requirements, while
for the MBMS SC-PTM bearers, AMR-WB does not appear to meet the
reference requirements.

#### 5.1.1.7 Listening effort evaluation of AMR-WB and EVS under impaired channels

##### 5.1.1.7.1 Test setup

For the evaluation of the listening effort, a P.800 listening effort
test was conducted at Fraunhofer IIS in German language. The P.800
\[24\] procedure was simply chosen because listening effort evaluation
is a key application part of the standard. The scale defined in \[24\]
is given in the following:

> 5 Complete relaxation possible; no effort required.\
> 4 Attention necessary; no appreciable effort required.\
> 3 Moderate effort required.\
> 2 Considerable effort required.\
> 1 No meaning understood with any feasible effort.

The speech material consisted of six talkers (3 male, 3 female), 4
samples of each talker, where each sample contains two sentences of the
Berlin sentence corpus. The clean speech material was combined with the
two noise types (coffee and siren), kindly provided by the NTIA over the
3GPP reflector, according to the EVS characterization processing. For
concatenation, a long noise sequence was assembled out of the provided
short samples. As SNR levels 10dB for coffee noise and 5dB for the siren
noise were chosen. Each noise type was evaluated in a separate
experiment.

26 conditions were evaluated consisting of 6 codec modes times 4 channel
conditions, plus 2 direct condtions. The codecs AMR-WB, EVS-WB, and
EVS-SWB have been included operating at the bit rates 13.2kbps
(12.85kbps for AMR-WB) and 24.4kbps (23.85kbps for AMR-WB), all using
DTX. The 13.2 kbps EVS modes were operated in channel-aware (CA) mode
(CA parameters: p=HI, o=3). All conditions have been evaluated using
clean channel and error profiles for 5%, 10%, 20% frame loss rate, using
the informative EVS-JBM for MTSI \[4\], specified in \[26\].

The delay and error profiles have been derived with the tool provided by
Qualcomm over the 3GPP SA4 reflector. For the EVS decoder, the JBM
correction for low jitter but high loss in \[25\] was active.

The listening test was conducted in a listening room according to the
requirements of P.800 using Sennheiser HD280 pro as the instrument for
diotic listening. The randomization of the samples was done according to
P.800 using the balanced block design method.

##### 5.1.1.7.2 Test results

The following plots show the mean scores and 95% confidence intervals
for the experiment with coffee background noise, where 25 naive subjects
participated. Unfortunately, not enough subjects did follow the lab
invitation for the siren noise experiment and it was not possible to
compensate the missing subjects. As a consequence, the it was decided to
omit this experiment. It should be noted that the number of listeners is
rather small for a codec selection process, however at least the number
of 24 listeners has been reached which is the usual minimum requirement
for listening tests in a codec qualification process. It should also be
noted that this experiment can only be considered a snapshot of
listening effort in a single language. Those results do therefore not
claim to be exhaustive and should only be used to evaluate trends.

Given that 25 listeners participated in the test and there were six
trials per condition, a total number of 3900 trials were reported,
meaning 150 trials per condition.

Figure 5.1.1.7.2-1: Plot of listening effort in 10dB SNR coffee
background noise for 13.2 kbps gross bit rate incl. AMR-WB, EVS-WB in
channel aware mode and EVS-SWB in channel aware mode

Figure 5.1.1.7.2-2: Plot of listening effort in 10dB SNR coffee
background noise for 24.4 kbps gross bit rate incl. AMR-WB, EVS-WB and
EVS-SWB

The following points can be observed:

-   All error-free conditions show an average score above 4 on the
    listening effort scale. These operation points seem to guarantee
    sufficiently low listening effort and are not considered as
    critical.

-   As the experiment design is focusing on high packet loss conditions,
    conclusions on other influencing factors such as audio bandwidth or
    bit rate can not be drawn

-   For packet loss rates of 5% and 10%, EVS always shows a
    significantly higher score compared to corresponding AMR-WB
    conditions

-   EVS with 10% packet loss rate performs similar to AMR-WB at 5%
    packet loss rate

-   Using the channel aware mode, EVS\@13.2kbps with 20% packet loss
    rate performs similar to AMR-WB\@12.65 with 10% packet loss rate.

### 5.1.2 Review of the Codec Alternatives and their Relative Speech Intelligibility in Clean and Low SNRs

The high noise intelligibility results in NTIA Report 15-520 \[16\]
provide valuable information for the selection of the codec for MCPTT.
For simplicity, operating conditions of codecs are not repeated in the
following paragraphs but they can be found in \[16\].

The report provides intelligibility scores, as measured with the
Modified Rhyme Test (MRT) methodology, across a range of noise
conditions for different codecs, bit rates and bandwidths but for SA4
only 3 codecs are really of direct interest; namely AMR (Sometimes
referred to as AMR NB in \[16\]), AMR-WB and EVS although the benchmarks
of Analogue FM and the P25 codec are of interest. These intelligibility
results were conducted without radio channel impairments.

In clean channel conditions, in two cases out of 12 EVS-NB performed
statistically significantly better than AMR but in the other 10 cases
there was no statistically significant difference.

In one case out of 18, EVS-WB performed statistically worse than AMR-WB,
but in this case EVS was operating at its lowest bit rate with DTX/CNG
enabled and at a lower bit rate than AMR-WB. In the other 17 cases there
was no statistically significant difference.

In three cases out of 24, EVS-FB performed statistically significantly
better than AMR-WB or EVS-WB, in one case EVS-FB performed statistically
worse than AMR-WB (Alarm noise -30dB SNR) and in the other 20 cases
there was no statistically significant difference.

\- From the NTIA report \[16\] using a WB codec results in higher
intelligibility than using a NB codec in noisy conditions.

\- In the NTIA report \[16\] for SNRs within the range 10dB to -5dB, FB
is always equivalent to or better than WB and NB in noisy conditions
from an intelligibility point of view.

\- The NTIA report \[16\] shows that the intelligibility increases (up
to a saturation level) with coded bitrate within confidence limits for a
given audio bandwidth.

#### 5.1.2.1 Speech Intelligibility

This Clause presents results from a subjective intelligibility test,
P.INTELL (as specified in ITU.T P.807 \[27\]), conducted by an
independent laboratory Dynastat, Inc.

**P.INTELL - Method and Procedure**

The P.INTELL test is designed to evaluate the Speech Intelligibility of
eight test conditions. The experimental design of P.INTELL is based on
the partially-balanced/randomized-blocks experimental design that has
been used in most codec standardization testing efforts in the past
decade for Speech Quality tests, i.e., tests described in ITU-T Rec.
P.800 \[24\]. The partially-balanced/randomized-blocks experimental
design is described and recommended in the ITU-T Handbook of Subjective
Testing Practical Procedures.

The test parameters for the P.INTELL test included:

-   Eight test conditions

-   Four talkers - two males and two females

-   Four samples per talker, where \"sample\" is described in the next
    section

-   32 subjects - four panels of eight naive subjects, each panel with
    an independent randomization of the speech materials

**Structure of the P.INTELL Test**

The P.INTELL source speech database includes 96 items, where each item
is a pair of single-syllable English words. For half of the items, the
words differ only in the initial consonant, i.e., rhyming word pairs.
For the other half, the words differ only in the final consonant, i.e.,
alliterative word pairs. The critical consonants in both the rhyming and
alliterative test-items differ only in a single Distinctive Feature,
either *Voicing*, *Nasality*, *Sustention*, *Sibilation*, *Graveness* or
*Compactness*. In P.INTELL a \"sample\" results from a single subject
selecting one of two words for each of the 96 presentation pairs. Table
5.1.2.1-0 shows the P.INTELL test items with the six distinctive
features, four samples, and four vowel/consonant start-stop
characteristic.

Table 5.1.2.1-0. P.INTELL test items

**Test Conditions**

Table 5.1.2.1-1 shows the test conditions list to evaluate the speech
intelligibility of the two codecs AMR-WB and the EVS-SWB CA. The AMR-WB
at 12.65 kbps and EVS-SWB CA at 13.2 kbps are tested at the frame
erasure rates of 2%, 8%, and 20%. The test also included the original
un-coded signal.

The intelligibility test was conducted in high noise and in impaired
channels. A background noise that mimics that of US police car Siren is
mixed with the input source at 5 dB. The Siren noise characteristic is
as shown in Figure 5.1.2.1-1 below (which has most of the noise energy
around 500-1500 Hz). The following procedure is used for noise mixing
(similar to that of the steps used in 3GPP tests): The input source is
normalized to -26 dBov, and noise is scaled such that the Siren noise
loudness is at -31 dBov. The normalized input source and the scaled
noise is mixed at SNR of 5 dB.

Figure 5.1.2.1-2. Steps to simulate impaired channel conditions

Figure 5.1.2.1-2 shows the steps to simulate the impaired channel
conditions that combines the Markov model based error traces with the
VoLTE uplink jitter and the MBMS/LTE-D downlink scheduler jitter. The
steps are further elaborated below.

**Step 1:** Apply Markov channel models (Table A.1.2-3 in Annex A.1.2)
to produce the error traces. 

**Step 2:** Simulate the eNB scheduling procedures described in Case1 in
clause A.1.3.  This models the minimum amount of jitter that would be
introduced in both the MBMS and LTE-D bearers and is caused by the MSP
for MBMS (see clause 5.3.6) and a similar minimum scheduling period for
LTE-D bearers. To simulate the VoLTE uplink jitter, the MTSI profile 2
is used.

**Step 3:** Convert the Markov model error traces to error profile.

**Step 4:** For EVS, use the \*.dat file and the following command lines
to generate the decoder output.

**Step 5:** For AMR-WB, the procedure is the same through the eNB
scheduler simulation.  Then, since no JBM is available for AMR-WB, we
used the 3GPP utility function (dlyerr\_2\_errpat.exe) made available by
SA4 that simulates jitter-buffer handling, resulting in a
circuit-switched packet file that can be passed to the normal AMR-WB
decoder.

**Low jitter scenario -- 3GPP EVS JBM Behavior**

The 3GPP EVS JBM was used for testing in EVS selection and
characterization tests. During the tests, the MTSI profiles 1 through 10
were used that are representative of VoLTE and HSPA, covering a wide
range of jitter and packet losses. The informative 3GPP EVS JBM was
never evaluated for other profiles such as MBMS. While investigating the
MBMS downlink packet scheduler, a bug in the 3GPP EVS de-jitter buffer
handling was uncovered in case of low jitter scenarios. In particular,
the JBM was not exercising the partial copy recovery logic as it was
locking up in a low jitter, high FER scenario. This scenario is a direct
consequence of using the informative-only 3GPP JBM, which was developed
specifically for EVS on VoLTE (not MBMS) using 3GPP VoLTE delay-loss
profiles. In Figure **5.1.2.1-2**, we are simulating the test case using
an approximation of the jitter based on modelling the MBMS downlink
packet scheduler, which triggers the problem. This does not happen for
the delay-loss profiles derived from commercial VoLTE field testing. In
the subjective evaluation testing that we conducted on Jan 07, 2016 the
3GPP EVS JBM included a bug fix provided by Fraunhofer IIS. A CR that
addresses the JBM issue was agreed at the January SA4\#87 meeting.

**Test Results -- Summary**

**ANOVA Statistical Analysis (AMR-WB vs EVS-SWB)**

Two sets of conditions, i.e., AMR-WB set 1: c02, c03, c04 and EVS-SWB CA
set 2: c05, c06, c07 are analyzed based on the Analysis of Variance
(ANOVA) metric. The appropriate statistical model is a three factor
Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) for Sets (2) x Conditions (3) x Scores (128
- 32 Subjects x 4 Talkers). Table 5.1.2.1-6 shows results of the ANOVA.

Table 5.1.2.1-6. Results of ANOVA for Sets x Conditions x Scores

The main effect for **Sets** factor is highly significant (p\<0.0001),
which means that the average scores for the two sets of conditions are
significantly different (AMR-WB: 79.830 and EVS-SWB CA: 83.140). The
main effect for **Conditions** factor is also highly significant
(p\<0.0001), which means that there is significant variation among the
average scores for the three conditions (86.950, 82.505, 75.000).
Finally, the interaction effect, **Sets x Conditions**, is significant
(p\<0.05), which indicates that the pattern of scores for the two Sets
across the three Conditions is statistically different. Figure 5.1.2.1-5
illustrates the significant interaction between the AMR-WB and the
EVS-SWB CA intelligibility scores.

##### 5.1.2.1.1 MCPTT bearers -- speech intelligibility 

Based on the results in clause 5.1.2.1, it can be concluded that EVS-SWB
CA offers a statisically significant improvement in speech
intelligibilty over AMR-WB (HD voice). The improved robustness to
background noise and resiliency to errors are particularly relevant to
the MCPTT service. For example, results for car noise at 20 dB and music
and mixed content in clean channel conditions in Clause 5.1.1.4 show
robustness to low levels of background noise. Results with other types
of noise (e.g., street noise and office babble @ 15-20dB SNR) and in
impaired channels (e.g., at FERs in the range of 3-10%) are elaborated
in TR 26.952. The test results in Clause 5.1.1.4 and TR 26.952 show
voice quality improvements based on the P.800 ACR/DCR test methodology,
but may not be fully indicative of speech intelligibility. The speech
intelligibility test results based on the P.INTELL test presented in
Clause 5.1.2.1 evaluates under high background noise (siren at 5dB) and
impaired channel conditions.

**Unicast bearer**

By definition of the reference summarized in clause 5.1.1.6.1, *AMR-WB
meets the reference performance.*

From the results in clause 5.1.2.1, it can be seen that *EVS-SWB CA
speech intelligiblity exceeds that of the reference.*

It is important to understand the coverage improvement provided by the
improved speech intelligibility of EVS-SWB CA. Based on the analysis in
clause 5.1.2.1 showing that speech intelligiblity of EVS-SWB CA @ 8% FER
is similar to that of AMR-WB @ 2%, the field test results identified in
clause 5.1.1.6.1 demonstrate that for FER\<=2%, the VoLTE system
achieves 90% coverage while for FER \<=8%, the system achieves 99.5%
coverage.

Table 5.1.2.1.1-1. AMR-WB and EVS-SWB CA Coverage Over MCPTT Unicast
Bearer

  --------------------------- ------------------- --------------------
  Codec and mode              **Operating FER**   **VoLTE Coverage**
  AMR-WB 12.65 kbps           **2%**              **90.0%**
  EVS 13.2 kbps SWB CA mode   **8%**              **99.5%**
  --------------------------- ------------------- --------------------

This demonstrates how *EVS-SWB CA can provide similar speech
intelligibilty as AMR-WB with better coverage in VoLTE networks.*

**MBMS bearer**

Based on the results in clause 5.1.2.1 it is expected that *EVS-SWB CA
speech intelligiblity exceeds that of AMR-WB under all the MBMS bearer
conditions tested.*

To understand the coverage improvement provided by the improved speech
intelligibility of EVS-SWB CA, Figure 5.1.2.1.1-1 below shows a CDF of
the coverage in an MBSFN cell embedded in a 57-cell system simulation at
different FERs on the MBMS downlink[^1]. Each curve is constructed by
looking at the SNR trace for each terminal in the cell and determining
the lowest SNR level below which the terminal experiences at least the
target FER, then plots the CDF of all the users against the SNR values.
The x-axis then represents the SNR that the MBMS Modulation and Coding
Scheme (MCS) needs to work with to achieve the target FER of each curve
for the percentage of users represented on the y-axis. Realistically,
the most robust MCS (MCS 0) needs an SNR of at least -4dB to operate, so
the curves to the left of -4dB SNR are not achievable.

Based on the data provided by this simulation, the MBMS system provides
less than 90% coverage at 2% end-to-end FER (1% uplink, 1% downlink). On
the other hand, the MBMS system can provide an MCS that would allow for
at least 90% coverage at 8% end-to-end FER (1% FER uplink, 7% FER
downlink).

This clearly demonstrates how a codec that is more resilient to FER can
have improved coverage area compared to a codec that is less resilient
to FER.

Therefore, neither AMR-WB nor EVS-SWB CA at 2% end-to-end FER (1%
uplink, 1% downlink) can meet the reference coverage KPI because the
underlying MBMS system can not provide at least 90% coverage at 2% FER.
AMR-WB speech intelligibility performance at 8% FER is statistically
lower than AMR-WB speech intelligibility performance at 2% FER. However
it is possible for EVS-SWB CA with 8% end-to-end FER (7% downlink and 1%
uplink) to exceed the reference coverage KPI without a statistically
significant intelligibility performance decrease compared to the
reference intelligibility performance.

Figure 5.1.2.1.1-1. Coverage in an MBSFN cell (embedded in a 57-cell
system simulation) at different FERs on the MBMS downlink

Comparing the 1% and 7% FER curves at any particular SNR value shows how
*EVS-SWB CA can provide similar speech intelligibilty as AMR-WB with
better coverage over the MBMS bearer.*

**LTE-D bearer**

The similarities in speech intelligibility between AMR-WB @ 2% FER and
EVS-SWB CA @ 8% FER demonstrated in clause 5.1.2.1 can be used to make
preliminary estimates about the coverage, power consumption, and
capacity improvement provided by the improved speech intelligibility of
EVS-SWB CA as was done in clause 5.1.1.6.4.3. The gains based on
similarities of subjective speech intelligibility are similar to the
gains based on equivalence of voice quality (based on objective P.OLQA
measure, Clause 5.1.1.6.3.4), and are listed in Tables 5.1.2.1.1-2 to
5.1.2.1.1-4.

+---------+--------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+

A comparison of the EVS-SWB CA and AMR-WB performance with respect to
the reference can be performed using Figure 5.1.1.6.3.4-2 as was done in
Clause 5.1.1.6.3.4. From the graph, it can be seen that AMR-WB can only
get 80% coverage at 2% FER, and to get to the reference 90% coverage
would introduce up to 5% FER. Given the trend that AMR-WB speech
intelligibility degrades with increasing FER beyond 2%, it is
questionable whether AMR-WB can meet the reference coverage for LTE-D
bearers. However, more data is needed to show this with statistical
significance.

On the other hand, as illustrated in Figure 5.1.1.6.3.4-2, EVS-SWB CA
(Option 1) can operate with 90% coverage and 4.5% FER while exceeding
the reference speech intelligibility. EVS-SWB CA can also achieve \~96%
coverage (at about 8% FER) with the intelligibility similar to the
reference. Therefore *EVS-SWB CA exceeds the reference over LTE-D
bearers in these three KPIs.*

The above simulations and calculations of coverage focused on the LTE-D
data channel and assumed the lower coding rate and lower RB usage of the
control (SA) channel would allow the data channel not to exceed 8% BLER.

A further analysis to account for data channel losses caused by errors
on the SA channel is calculated using the simulation data illustrated in
Figure 5.1.2.1.1-2 on the SA channel link performance and Figure
5.1.1.6.3.4-1 on the link budget performance for the data channel. A
link budget of 0.63 dB on the data channel provides 7.4% BLER if the SA
channel does not introduce more errors. Since the SA channel uses only 1
RB, the effective SNR is 3.63 dB. The SA channel with 2 HARQs reduces
the SA channel BLER to 0.65% which results in an effective BLER 8.0% for
the data channel carrying the voice packets which represents the BLER
needed for EVS-CA. Performing the same analysis for the BLER needed for
AMR-WB, a link budget of 3.56 dB on the data channel results in a data
channel BLER of 1.91% and a SA channel BLER of 0.1%, resulting in an
effective BLER of 2.0%.

This provides the following results on coverage and capacity over LTE-D
bearers.

##### 5.1.2.1.2 Conclusions 

Speech Intelligibility:

-   EVS-SWB offers significant speech intelligibility improvements over
    the reference. It also offers even more improvements over AMR-WB
    under the same bearer conditions. The improved robustness to
    background noise and resiliency to errors are particularly relevant
    to the MCPTT service and result in better speech intelligibly
    compared to the reference and AMR-WB across all the MCPTT bearers.

-   AMR-WB meets the reference speech intelligibility for unicast
    bearers.

-   A downward trend in intelligibility performance with increasing FER
    raises a question about whether AMR-WB can meet the reference speech
    intelligibility for the MBMS and LTE-D bearers.  However more data
    is needed to show this with statistical significance.

In summary, based on the select speech intelligibility test results
presented in clause 5.1.2.1,

-   EVS-SWB outperforms AMR-WB in the selected KPIs and across all the
    MCPTT bearers.

-   There are some MCPTT bearers where some KPIs cannot be meaningfully
    compared to the reference \"HD Voice\" experience:

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   In the cases that allow a comparison to the reference (call capacity
    on unicast, coverage and error-resiliency/intelligibility on all
    MCPTT bearers), EVS exceeds the performance of the reference for all
    the bearers. In these cases, AMR-WB meets the reference for unicast
    bearers. A downward trend in speech intelligibility performance with
    increasing FER raises a question about whether AMR-WB can meet the
    reference KPI for the MBMS and LTE-D bearers.  However more data is
    needed to show this with statistical significance.

-   In the cases that do not allow a comparison to the reference
    (capacity on MBMS and LTE-D), the EVS codec outperforms AMR-WB
    across all MCPTT bearers. Based on a similar analysis as in Clause
    5.1.1.6.3.2-4, the call capacity of EVS-SWB CA exceeds that of
    AMR-WB across all MCPTT bearers.

The Table 5.1.2.1.2-1 below provides a comparison based on the above
conclusions and highlights some key results.

### 5.1.3 Review of Codec Alternatives and their Relative Complexity

The complexity of the EVS codec is described in subclause 13.2 of TR
26.952 \[3\]. Tables 13.2a, 13.2c and 13.2d from \[3\], reproduced below
as Tables 3, 4,and 5, provide a comparison of the mean of the
per-audio-frame complexity for EVS and AMR-WB, analysed with a source
file comprising 8.5 minutes of mixed speech and music. In the case of
the decoders the complexity is measured in the presence of 30% frame
erasures and the EVS operation is analysed by bandwidth and sample rate.

From Table 5 it can be seen that under the same conditions, the EVS
codec requires 69% more processing on average to reproduce twice the
audio bandwidth in a SWB capable UE than the AMR-WB codec providing WB.
It can also be seen that in a WB-only capable UE, the EVS codec requires
41% more processing on average..

The worst-case observed complexity of EFR and AMR is given in \[7\] as
15.21 and 15.33 WMOPs respectively but both the bit-exact instruction
weights and methodology have changed in arriving at the complexity
figures for EVS and for AMR-WB above. The complexity of the 3GPP Codecs,
beginning with GSM EFR in 1995 \[7 & 8\], followed by AMR in 1999 \[7\],
AMR-WB in 2001 \[13\] and EVS in 2015 \[3\] is plotted in Figure 1.

Figure 15: Complexity of 3GPP Codecs over time

The computational complexity is one metric which can be considered
amongst others. It is acknowledged that there are other important
complexity metrics, such as the physical footprint or area, but these
are not readily available and not provided in the document.

### 5.1.4 Recommended requirements

It is important that at least one of the codecs supported in all MCPTT
terminals is capable of providing equivalent or better performance than
3GPP wideband voice (\"HD Voice\") in terms of coverage,
error-resiliency, speech quality, speech intelligibility, and call
capacity across all MCPTT radio bearers.

It is recommended that a codec that is important for MCPTT
communications be mandated for MCPTT terminals.

It is recommended that a codec that has features that are only \"nice to
have\", but not essential, for MCPTT communications be recommended for
MCPTT terminals. The network transcoding functions have to support this
codec if the codec is to be used between terminals in MCPTT sessions.

Requirements for interworking with legacy public safety systems is
outside the scope of this release.

### 5.1.5 GAP Analysis and Evaluation

#### 5.1.5.1 Requirements on Audio/Voice Quality 

With regard to Audio/Voice Quality (TS 22.179 \[2\] subclause 6.15.5),
several narrowband quality benchmarks, met by the P25 codecs and perhaps
also the TETRA codec, should be surpassed. Whilst these benchmarks are
expressed in terms of objective predictions of subjective MOS (ACR) test
scores (Recommendations ITU-T P.862 and ITU-T P.863), it is well known
that such techniques have shortcomings when comparing codecs of
different technologies, not to mention codecs with different audio
bandwidths. It is nevertheless clear that high audio quality is to be
preferred.

Interestingly there is no mention in TS 22.179 about requirements for
speech intelligibility but it is quite obvious that for the MCPTT
application, speech intelligibility is a key requirement. Neither audio
quality nor intelligibility in noise is mentioned, apart from in the
context of the inherent noise reduction capabilities of the coding
algorithm. Again though, high quality and intelligibility in background
noise would appear to be self-evident requirements.

#### 5.1.5.2 Discrete/Ambient Listening and Remotely Initiated Monitoring

For Discrete/Ambient Listening (TS 22.179 \[2\] subclauses 6.16.1 &
6.16.2) and Remotely Initiated Monitoring (TS 22.179 \[2\] subclause
6.16.3) it is clearly desirable to encode the audio/speech signals
present in the foreground and any background signal.

These requirements clearly favour high quality audio codecs able to cope
with non-speech signals. It also seems self-evident that wider audio
bandwidths, able to capture more details, are to be preferred. It may
also be preferred for noise suppression algorithms present in UE\'s and
DTX to be disabled in discrete/ambient listening and remotely initiated
monitoring for optimum performance.

#### 5.1.5.3 Noise Reduction 

From examination of the Noise Reduction requirements described in
subclause 5.14 of \[2\] it is clear that the contributors to TS 22.179
wish to emphasize the inherent noise suppression capabilities of the low
bit rate coding algorithms of P25 and TETRA. This emphasis, whilst one
possible approach to the problem of background noise, is however in
conflict with the requirements for high audio/voice quality and with the
requirements for ambient listening which are best delivered by accurate
rendering at the decoder of the input signal to the codec.

3GPP is well aware of the need for high quality audio in the presence of
background noise and, rather than rely on the inherent weaknesses of the
coding algorithms, has developed and encouraged the adoption of adaptive
noise suppression technologies in UE\'s prior to the audio encoding
stage to address these challenges. See \[14\] and \[15\]. As mentioned
above though, a method of disabling the noise suppression algorithms
present in the UE\'s would be advantageous for the Discrete/Ambient
Listening and Remotely Initiated Monitoring applications.

#### 5.1.5.4 Common Codec Constraints of MCPTT

MCPTT has the following scenarios/use cases that impact the use of
mandatory/recommended codecs:

\- The group communication can be off-network using the D2D physical
layer, in which case a transcoding function is not available. The lack
of transcoding requires that the codec selected has to be supported by
all terminals in the session. Furthermore, the D2D physical layer for
group call uses a broadcast channel that is received by the group
members. This also requires that the codec selected has to be supported
by all terminals in the session.

\- The group communication can be on-network using a broadcast bearer.
This also requires that the codec selected has to be supported by all
terminals in the session.

The need to use a common codec among all the participants impacts the
ability to use any recommended codecs due to the following:

1\) If one of the participants does not support the recommended codec
then the call set-up will fail or require codec re-negotiation. This
raises the following issues:

a\) Codec renegotiation delays the call set-up and may not be acceptable
in all scenarios, especially for mission-critical communications.

b\) Codec re-negotiation for MCPTT is more cumbersome than for typical
point-to-point calls due to the following:

i\) The responses to the session initiator regarding its selected
recommended codec can come at different times from the other
participants. If some terminals are in poor radio conditions their
responses may be lost or delayed due to transport layer retransmissions.
Thus the need to re-negotiate the codec may not be known until later
into the call. If the initiator waits for confirmation from all
participants before sending media then the media start could be very
delayed. If the initiator starts sending media immediately, it will mean
that some terminals (the ones unable to use the codec) will still
experience much delay before being able to render media to the user. The
others will be interrupted when the codec is re-negotiated, likely down
to a lower quality codec, thus causing a poor user experience.

ii\) If the initiating terminal does not get any additional information
about the other session participants (aside from a call rejection), then
the initiator may have to try different recommended codecs multiple
times before selecting one that all the terminals can use.

iii\) If the initiating terminal receives additional codec capability
information from the session participants in response to its proposed
codec, this requires transmission of more information (e.g. codec
capabilities/profile of the terminal) to the initiator in the reverse
direction. This will require more time to send the additional
information from multiple participants and require that the initiator
wait even longer before deciding on what to include in the codec
renegotiation proposal, thus delaying the transmission of media.

2\) To avoid setting up a session that might require codec
re-negotiation the terminal can resort to the following:

a\) Not use any recommended codecs and only use a mandatory codec

b\) Attempt to determine out-of-band and beforehand, the codec
capabilities of all the terminals it wishes to add to the call

i\) This could be done by pre-provisioning the terminals with a profile
that is shared among a group of callers, i.e., the Rennes Police
Department; the members of the MBS SWG.

ii\) Or this could be obtained through some capabilities exchange
performed out-of-band which may be application- or lower-layer based.

3\) Even when all the terminals in a session can support the selected
recommended codec, this still places constraints or impacts performance
if the group wants to add another caller to the existing session. This
raises the following issues:

a\) The participants would have to know beforehand that the new caller
can support the codec they are using. How can this be easily done in a
user-friendly way?

b\) If the above is not known, there is a chance they would have to
renegotiate their codec and \"dumb-down\" their media to match that of
the new caller.

c\) If there is a re-negotiation to another codec there will be
disruption in the call and the existing callers will most likely notice
a degradation in call quality, e.g. going from SWB to WB, or from WB to
NB audio. This results in a very poor user experience.

#### 5.1.5.5 Requirements on Transcoding Functions in the Network

In on-network point-to-point communications which allow use of a
transcoder function, there are some challenges that need to be
considered when attempting to use a recommended codec for MCPTT.

1\) There needs to be a transcoder function to support use of
recommended codecs. How does the terminal know that there is a
transcoder function in the network?

2\) The transcoder function has to support the recommended codec in
order for the terminal to be able to use the codec, even if all the
other terminals in the call support the recommended codec. An MRFC
cannot allow a recommended codec that its MRFP does not support to be
included in the SDP Offers relayed to the called participants. If some
of the participants answer using the recommended codec while others do
not, the MRFP will not have the proper codecs to support the session.

Therefore, for a MCPTT group to be able to use a recommended codec for
its own-network sessions without codec-renegotiation **requires that the
network transcoding function supports the recommended codec**. This
becomes complicated to ensure when the MCPTT group is not closely
coordinated with the MNO who owns and operates the transcoder function
in the network. For example, how does the MBS SWG user group
ask/guarantee that the Orange network in Rennes supports EVS
transcoding?

### 5.1.6 Criteria with respect to MCPTT codec selection

Many factors were considered in the evaluation of codecs for use in
MCPTT. In addition to the analysis in the preceding clauses some of
these factors and trade-offs are described in this clause.

For example, public safety grade communications (e.g. MCPTT) are
required to operate with high levels of reliability and availability
(e.g. minimum downtown time). Another example is the importance of
conservation of battery across a first responder's long shift.

While the following list is not meant to be exhaustive (there are
selection factors that may not be captured here), these factors give
additional information.

1\) Availability of devices that include the codec --

This can be described as time to market. The sooner a large number of
UEs that utilize the codec are available for MCPTT the better the
timeline of early MCPTT deployments can be met. Related to this factor
are:

a\) use of the MCPTT application on existing devices

b\) large volume of devices that utilize the codec may help drive down
cost

2\) Maturity of the codec vs. the benefits of the latest standardized
codec --

This can be described as a trade-off balancing the benefits in
performance afforded from the latest standardized codec vs. the known
performance and reliability of an existing codec that has been deployed
on millions of devices for several years. Related to this factor:

a\) stability -- trade-off balancing the benefits from improvements
afforded from the latest standardized codec vs. the stability of using a
codec that is less likely to change over time

3\) Flexibilty, complexity, and configuration --

This can be described as a trade-off balancing the benefits in
flexibility, and improved performance under certain conditions, afforded
from the latest standardized codec vs. code complexity and additional
configuration options. Related to this factor are:

a\) use of the codec on non-3GPP terminals (wireline), e.g. consoles and
dispatch terminals

b\) power consumption for terminals with chipsets containing the codec
and processing demands for terminals without chipsets containing the
codec (e.g. software downloadable)

c\) integration effort to effectively utilize a codec in terminals

NOTE: Despite disagreement on the importance of the factors in this
clause and the previous clauses, a codec decision is documented in
clause 6.

### 5.1.7 Solution

After consideration of all factors in Release 13 the currently widely
deployed and available AMR-WB codec meets the needs of MCPTT services
and is recommended as the mandatory codec for MCPTT. Based on operator /
MCPTT service provider policy, it is recommended that EVS operating in
super-wideband mode be supported as an optional codec that can be used
for MCPTT services.

5.2 Key Issue\#2: User Experience
---------------------------------

### 5.2.1 Description

A building in the business area, which is covered by cellular network,
is on fire, an MCPTT group call is set up and fire fighters involved in
the mission join this MCPTT group. Most MCPTT group members, who stay
inside of building, receive the MCPTT group call over broadcast channel,
some fire fighters, who stay outside of building, receive the MCPTT
group call over unicast channel. All fire fighters have the same
experience of mouth-to-ear latency and floor control regardless the
audio is transferred over unicast or broadcast delivery. A fire fighter
carrying an injured person moves out of building and waits the ambulance
in a safe zone. After the injured person is transferred away, he reports
this information to the MCPTT group while he is moving back into the
building and helps other wounded people. He notices that the fire in the
room will be out of control; he immediately reports this information to
the MCPTT group and starts to move the wounded person away from this
area. After several hours of hard work, the fire in the building is
finally put out and the MCPTT group is dismissed.

### 5.2.2 Recommended requirements

The following recommended requirements are derived from the uses case.

\- For on-network mode case, it is recommended that the service
interruption is minimized when the MCPTT UE moves into/out of MBMS
coverage.

\- For on-network mode case, it is recommended that all MCPTT users will
have the same experience, e.g. access delay regardless the MCPTT call is
transferred over UC or BC.

\- For on-network mode case, it is recommended that the difference of
Mouth-to-ear of latency of audio payload between MCPTT users using
unicast delivery method and MCPTT users using broadcast delivery method
is minimized.

Note: In TS 22.179, the user experience related requirement is also
copied below:

*\"\[R-6.15.3.2-002\] The MCPTT Service shall provide the MCPTT Access
time and Mouth-to-ear latency specified in this subclause to all MCPTT
Users related to an MCPTT call regardless of call type (e.g. group,
Private Call), group size and/or user density.*

NOTE: This ensures that all MCPTT Users experience the same performance
regardless of whether the audio is transferred over unicast or multicast
delivery.\"

### 5.2.3 GAP Analysis and Evaluation

#### 5.2.3.1 Longer e2e delay over BC bearer issue

Per TR 36.868, The minimum end to end delay for media transport for
Group Communications over eMBMS is about160 ms (refers to TR 36.868,
clause 5.2.1.1.3), and end to end delay for media transport over unicast
bearers is about 40 ms (refers to TR 36.868, clause 5.1.1.3).

The RTP payload transmission timing sequence is depicted in figure 15a.

Figure 15a: The RTP payload timing sequence

The longer delay over BC degrades MCPTT user\'s experience.
Consequently, the delay for unicast reception and for MBMS reception may
be different. This identified gap needs to be addressed.

#### 5.2.3.2 Mobility issue

Per TS \[, the GCS AS acts as the media source, the BM-SC receives the
RTP payload from the GCS-AS. The received RTP payload will be put on the
MBMS bearer without modifying any RTP headers like SSRC, SN and TS, as
this information is filled by GCS AS.

Figure 16 presents a case that the UE in a MCPTT call moving in/out of
MBMS coverage.

![](media/image67.wmf){width="6.5in" height="1.3229166666666667in"}

Figure 16: Handoff scenarios between UC bearer and BC bearer

When the distribution delay of unicast and broadcast is different, then
the quality may be distorted during handoffs.

##### 5.2.3.2.1 BC handoff to UC

When the UE moves out of MBMS coverage, for the break before make case
(refers to TS 23.468 \[12\], clause 5.3.3), the UE starts receiving DL
data over unicast after it has stopped receiving data over eMBMS. As
showed in figure 17, UE receives RTP payload (SN=1,2,\...,m) at MBMS
coverage, BC HO to UC occurs at time t0, the UE receives the RTP payload
with SN=m+n due to longer transmission delay over MBMS bearer.

Figure 17: RTP advance and rewind caused by handoff between BC and UC

This SN number advancing issue impacts user\'s experience.

For the make before break case, when the UE notifies the GCS AS that the
UE is moving out of MBMS coverage and the GCS AS starts to send the data
over UC. The UE simultaneously receives data by Unicast Delivery and
MBMS Delivery. As showed in figure 17, During HO period from t0 to t1,
the UE receives the RTP payload with SN=m+1 to p-1 over MBMS bearer, the
UE receives the RTP payload with SN=m+n to q over UC bearer. UE has two
sequences of RTP payloads with discontinuous SN number.

The RTP sequence selection and SN number advancing issue needs to be
fixed.

##### 5.2.3.2.2 UC handoff to BC

For switching from unicast delivery to MBMS delivery case (refers to TS
23.468, clause 5.3.2), the UE simultaneously receives data by Unicast
Delivery and MBMS Delivery. As shown in Figure 17, from t2 to t3 period,
the UE receives duplicated RTP payloads (SN number from s-j to s) over
MBMS bearer. At the same time, the UE continues receiving new RTP
payloads (SN number from s+1 to s+j+1) over unicast bearer.

The UE notifies the GCS AS via GC1 that it is in MBMS coverage and
receiving the MBMS bearer service. At time t3, the GCS AS stops sending
the data over by Unicast Delivery to this UE. The UE now receives the
content only by MBMS Delivery. The UE receives RTP payload with SN
starting from s+1 over broadcast bearer. During time t3 to t4, the UE
receives RTP payload with SN starting from s+j+1 over BC bearer.

The RTP sequence selection issue needs to be fixed during t2 to t4.

### 5.2.4 Assumptions

The following list of working assumptions is derived from the uses case.

\-- For on-network mode case, an MCPTT user\'s service experience is not
interrupted by the movement of the MCPTT UE and the change of delivery
method of audio.

\- For on-network mode case, the MCPTT service is able to grant the
floor control regardless of the MCPTT UE\'s reception mode (unicast
reception, broadcast reception).

### 5.2.5 Solution

#### 5.2.5.1 Transport delay difference adjustment

To mitigate delay differences between MBMS bearer and unicast bearers,
the transport delay difference of MBMS bearer is proposed to be reported
back to GCS AS. The GCS AS adjusts the timing of RTP payload over
unicast to minimize the transport delay between UC and BC.

The reporting method has 3 options.

\- Option A: RTCP method (RFC 3550)

\- Option B: QoE procedure of MBMS

\- Option C: GC1 interface enhancement

Option A requires RFC enhancement or 3GPP defined extensions, RTCP
reporting interval is another concern. Option B only requires QoE
enhancement, however, whether MBMS QoE procedure is applied to MCPTT is
open now. Option C requires SA6 co-ordination.

It is proposed to consider option B considering re-using existing MBMS
mechanism as much as possible.

#### 5.2.5.2 RTP payload treatment

Once UE receives 2 RTP flows from both UC and BC with same and/or
different SN value (but the same SSRCs), UE should accept those 2 RTP
flows, discard redundant RTP payloads, reorder those RTP payloads and
submit ordered RTP payloads to the upper layer.

If RTP SN advancing is detected, the UE should reports advancing
information back to GCS AS to allow transport delay adjustment if the
majority of participants use MBMS reception. The GCS may not perform any
delay adjustment if the majority of participants use unicast delivery.

5.3 Key Issue\#3: MCPTT over MBMS support
-----------------------------------------

### 5.3.1 Description

The main purpose of MCPTT is one to many communications. The speech
contributions from a single user is distributed to many receivers. A
central floor control arbitrator (here, logically located in the MCPTT
server) \[2\] controls the floor.

![](media/image69.wmf){width="6.729166666666667in" height="3.125in"}

Figure 18: PTT Groups

MCPTT needs to support many simultaneous and possibly large groups. A
MCPTT user may be affiliated to one or more groups at a time. The groups
may be used by different organizations such as police and fire brigade.
MCPTT users are typically affiliated to the groups of a single
organization. MCPTT users may also be affiliated to groups of multiple
organizations. It should be assumed that MCPTT users are generally
affiliated to more than one group at a time.

MCPTT Group call media may be carried over unicast and/or MBMS bearer
services. For the media plane, the MCPTT server decides on one of the
three cases:

1: which MCPTT group call media is forwarded over unicast-only,

2: which MCPTT group call media is forwarded over broadcast-only or

3: which MCPTT group call media is forwarded over unicast for some users
and broadcast at the same time for other users.

It is unclear, whether case 2 can be regarded as a sub-case of case 3 or
needs to be explicitly supported.

Note, service continuity between unicast and broadcast needs to be
supported for case 3 (above). MCPTT devices may move into the broadcast
coverage or may leave the broadcast coverage without or without
significant (ffs) service interruption.

An MCPTT group is defined in a group management system. The group
definition includes a list of members of the group. When a MCPTT user is
authenticated and registered to the MCPTT system the user can affiliate
to one or more MCPTT groups that the user is a member of. The definition
of being affiliated is found in TS 22.179 \[2\]:

**Affiliated MCPTT Group Member**: An MCPTT Group Member who has
indicated an interest in the group and is prepared to receive and/or
transmit Group Communications from/to the particular MCPTT Group.

![](media/image70.wmf){width="6.747916666666667in"
height="2.123611111111111in"}

Figure 19: Example MCPTT calls (downlink only)

The figure above illustrates some MCPTT calls of two different groups as
example. Note that user 5 belongs to both groups. Each MCPTT Group Call
consists of one or more speech contributions from different users. Each
speech contribution is called a Talk Burst. Note that User 1 in the
above example had two Talk Bursts in the first MCPTT Group Call.

An MCPTT Group Call is typically short and lasts for typically not more
than 30 sec (these are only considerations, a talk burst can be 10 sec,
but may be longer or shorter) . Resources are released based on idle
timers. The MCPTT Group Call setup (Access Time) time will be below 300
ms.

In order to achieve low Group Call Setup times, the MBMS bearer is
already established and devices inside of the MBMS coverage have already
activated the reception of the bearer. MBMS MCPTT Call setup is
triggered by the first floor request. Devices will continuously receive
the MBMS bearer traffic, when in broadcast coverage, in order to receive
the MBMS MCPTT floor control messages.

The MBMS Bearers used for MCPTT will be pre-established. In order to
increase efficiency, each MBMS Bearer Service is provisioned to carry
the traffic of multiple MCPTT groups. For example, an MBMS Bearer
Service is provisioned to carry 20 different MCPTT groups, but allow
only talk bursts of up to 4 groups at a time. In this example, the MBMS
bearer is provisioned to carry 4 simultaneous talk bursts (e.g. GBR set
to 80kbps, while each talk bursts needs 20kbps). Devices become aware
about the different, possible MBMS MCPTT groups during service
announcement.

Devices will locally discard data, which belongs to not-affiliated
groups (the device may receive data, which belongs to other groups). One
MBMS bearer service should typically only carry MCPTT group data for
groups within one organization, to minimize that data that is discarded
by the MCPTT client.

Speech contributions (called Talk Bursts) from one or more users can be
distributed during the MCPTT Group Call. The MCPTT server decides which
user gets the floor (floor control). For each MCPTT Group Call (or for
each talk burst), the MCPTT server decides whether to map the Call onto
unicast or broadcast. If another MCPTT Group Call with a higher priority
or with a larger receiver size becomes active (or increases in
priority), the MCPTT changes the decision and moves an ongoing MCPTT
Group call to unicast. There may be multiple different reasons why the
MCPTT server decides to reallocate an on-going MCPTT call to broadcast
or to unicast. The service continuity realization should allow the
reallocation of on-going group call from unicast to broadcast and vice
versa without or with minor (ffs) service interruptions.

The MCPTT system may utilize multiple MBMS Bearers based on network
operator policy. Note, per 3GPP Rel 12 standards, existing MBMS UEs are
only required to receive a single MBMS bearer at a time. Further, per
3GPP Rel 12 standard, existing MBMS UEs are not required to support
unicast interactions while receiving MBMS bearers (simultaneous usage of
unicast & MBMS bearers). Note, the on-going 3GPP Rel 13 PRoSE work
assumes that at least relay UEs are capable of handle unicast and
multiple MBMS bearer services simultaneously.

There are requirements to allow overriding in MCPTT. An on-going MCPTT
talk burst may be overridden. Thus, the MCPTT client will monitor the
reception while talking in order to detect overrides (i.e. receive MCPTT
data while transmitting MCPTT data).

Audio rendering details (i.e. when the device needs to render
contributions from multiple sources) are left to implementation.

Any service announcement will be done well in advance, likely at the
time, when the device affiliates with the group. The precise time and
procedure for service announcement is open.

### 5.3.2 Deployment Considerations

MBMS is currently deployed in several networks. The present MCPTT
architecture assumes, that all MBMS related functions are re-implemented
and realized in the MCPTT server and the MCPTT Client.

The deployment option should be studied, where the MCPTT Server can
delegate functions into the BM-SC and whether the MCPTT client can
leverage functions from a separately implemented MBMS Client. The
present MEPRO-API work illustrates the possible realization of APIs
between an App (here the MCPTT client) and the MBMS client.

### 5.3.3 Realization (Stage 3) Considerations (On-Network)

From the general MCPTT description, a couple of Stage 3 considerations
and requirements can be derived.

The MCPTT client may be affiliated to multiple MCPTT groups.

The MCPTT clients have always established unicast uplink EPS bearer for
media for a given group (e.g. for requesting the floor and providing
speech contributions) simultaneously with downlink MBMS bearer for media
plane.

The MCPTT client has established downlink EPS bearer for media plane
while it is able to receive the MBMS bearer for that group.

RTP session for broadcast may have also RTCP uplink associated to it.

The MCPTT client notifies the MCPTT server, once it is able to receive
the MBMS bearer which is associated with the group. The MCPTT server may
not provide the MCPTT Group Call over unicast EPS bearer to that MCPTT
client until the MCPTT client informs the MCPTT server that the MCPTT
client has left or is leaving the MBMS bearer coverage. Note that the
MCPTT server may not always provide the MCPTT Group Call over MBMS
bearers, if other Group Calls are given higher priority for that MBMS
bearer.

Per indication by MCPTT server that MBMS bearer is established, the
MCPTT client will continuously receive and monitor the MBMS Bearer, when
inside of the broadcast coverage, in order to understand, whether the
content of an affiliated group is sent over the associated MBMS bearer.
The MCPTT client notifies the MCPTT server over GC1 interface, once it
does not finding the MBMS bearer anymore.

It is assumed, that the MCPTT client will select receiving MCPTT group
call over MBMS if it is available. When MBMS access information (see
clause 5.3.7) is provided for an MCPTT group, then the MCPTT client will
activate MBMS reception through the time of affiliation with the group.

MCPTT clients have to be prepared that traffic from non-affiliated
groups is received on MBMS bearers. The MCPTT client will silently
discard the traffic of non-affiliated groups, when receiving MCPTT via
MBMS bearers.

Usage of UDP sessions and destination UDP ports (in downlink direction
from MCPTT server to the MCPTT client): In case of unicast, the UDP
destination port (scoped with the IP unicast address of the device) is
allocated by the receiver and communicated back to the MCPTT server.

Each MBMS Bearer Service may be provisioned to carry the traffic of
multiple MCPTT groups, not all Groups are active at a time. The device
may need to monitor multiple MBMS bearers.

### 5.3.4 Media Handling

In unicast delivery mode, the UE address is assigned by the P-GW. The UE
registers its IP address to the MCPTT server. The MCPTT server
encapsulates with UE\'s IP address as destination IP address of RTP
payload. The P-GW routes IP packets from the MCPTT server to the UE.

In broadcast delivery mode, the group\'s multicast IP-address is
provided by the MCPTT server to the UEs. Therefore the MCPTT server
encapsulates with the multicast IP address as used by the UEs as
destination IP address of RTP packets and floor control packets. Once
the BM-SC receives UDP/IP packets over MB2-U interface, the received
packets will be put on the MBMS bearer associated with TMGI/flow
identifier for the MCPTT group without any modification.

### 5.3.5 QoE for MCPTT over MBMS

#### 5.3.5.1 QoE for both MNO and MCPTT service provider

In TS 26.346 \[11\], the MBMS reception reporting server is configured
by the BM-SC, the UE reports the QoE result to the MBMS reception
reporting server. The QoE report is used by MNO to evaluate the MBMS
user service and MBMS transport network performance.

The MCPTT server may be located outside of MNO network; it will benefit
MNO if the current QoE reception report mechanism is kept to allow MNO
evaluating the eMBMS transport layer performance. Besides the benefit to
MNO, it is foreseen that the QoE result also helps MCPTT service
provider evaluating the MCPTT service QoE via MBMS bearer.

It is proposed that:

\- The MBMS client reports QoE to the network to benefit MNO for MBMS
transport network performance evaluation.

\- The MCPTT UE reports QoE to the MCPTT provider for MCPTT service
quality evaluation with maximum re-use of existing MBMS QoE support.

### 5.3.6 eNB Scheduling on the MBMS Bearer

When carrying traffic over MBMS/MBSFN, the eNB schedules and transmits
the packets received from the MCPTT AS according to the timestamp within
the SYNC packet (see clause 15.3.3 in TS 36.300 \[19\]) corresponding to
the MCH Scheduling Period (MSP), e.g., 40 or 80 ms, on the MBMS bearer.

It is recommended that a MCPTT UE that receives traffic over an MBSFN
bearer uses a de-jitter buffer that can manage this type of jitter.

### 5.3.7 Needed information to describe an MCPTT User Plane

Rel 13 MCPTT is limited to support to Speech related media streams.
Other media streams may be added in later releases.

In order to describe a speech related media stream over MBMS bearers,
the device needs to receive at least the following information

\- The number of media in the session.

\- The destination IP address and port number for each RTP sessions in
the MBMS bearer service.

\- The protocol ID (e.g. RTP/AVPMedia type(s) and fmt-list.

\- Mode of MBMS bearer per media.

\- Multi-Carrier deployments should be supported. The UE needs to
interpret SIB15 correctly.

\- The start time and end time of the session.

\- In case Source Specific IP Multicast (SSM) is required for MCPTT,
also the Sender IP Address will be present.

\- In order to support nation wide services through multiple PLMN-IDs, a
list of alternative TMGIs may be present. Note, it is unclear whether
this case is relevant for MCPTT.

Note, all above information except the information for Multi-Carrier
support can be encoded in SDP.

6 Conclusion
============

In this document, many issues related to MCPTT, from media handling and
codec perspective have been documented.

On the key issue \"codec for MCPTT\", analysis of various 3GPP codecs is
provided, along with a recommendation for Release 13 to mandate that the
AMR-WB codec be supported for MCPTT applications and, based on operator
/ MCPTT service provider policy, have EVS in super-wideband mode
supported as an optional codec. The EVS codec was shown to provide
statistically significant performance improvements relative to the
AMR-WB codec for some of the MCPTT KPIs as studied and reported in this
document

On the key issue \"User Experience\", it is recommended that the UE
discards redundant RTP payloads in the case that the received RTP
payloads by the UE contain identical SN and SSRC.

On the key issue \"MCPTT over MBMS support\", the following points have
been made

\- Realization considerations for MCPTT client operation in support of
MBMS have been documented

\- The media handling for unicast delivery mode and broadcast delivery
mode has been documented

\- It is recommended MCPTT UE uses a de-jitter buffer, when receiving
traffic over an MBMS bearer

\- The session information needed to describe the MCPTT user plane is
provided.

######### Annex A: Simulation Models and Parameters

A.1 MBMS Bearer Simulation Model
================================

A.1.1 Coverage
--------------

As described in clause 5.1.1.6.2.1, coverage using an MBMS bearer cannot
guarantee a target FER throughout the entire coverage area. In SC-PTM,
the limitations of geometry/SNR and the interference from adjacent cells
limits the throughput and error rate that can be achieved.

Simulations of a single cell surrounded by two rings of adjacent cells
that transmit at only 50% of their total unicast traffic were performed
using the following simulation parameters:

Figure A.1.1.-1 Serving cell (green) in the center is surrounded by the
two rings of (yellow) cells that are only transmitting at 50% to reduce
their interference on the serving cell.

The results of the simulation showed that even with the two rings of
neighbouring cells reducing their load to 50%, the serving cell could
not guarantee an FER \<=1% for the entire cell (the coverage was less
than 95% of the cell). The coverage in the serving cell would be even
worse when the neighbouring cells are transmitting closer to their full
load. Furthermore, other challenging environments such as indoor,
basement, elevator, stairwell, etc.... reception would further impair
the MBMS bearer error rate.

Therefore the MBMS error traces used to evaluate the performance of 3GPP
speech codecs were chosen with FER values in the range of 1 to 5%.

A.1.2 Error Traces
------------------

During the Application Layer FEC work of Rel-12 an MBMS bearer model was
defined and documented in \[20\] , clause 5.3. In communication with
RAN1 and RAN2, it was agreed to use a two-state Markov model for the
simulation of LTE RLC-PDU losses as shown in Figure A.1.2-1:

The simulation was carried out with a 19 sites configuration as shown in
Figure A.1.2-2:. Each site has 3 cells. All sites have 100% SFN
operation. 30 UEs are uniformly dropped into the center site (dark green
one) in each simulation run of 50 sec. In total 900 UEs are dropped and
the SNR is sampled accordingly. The overall SNR distribution is also
shown in Figure A.1.2-2.

Figure A.1.2-2 Simulation Grid and SNR distribution

Based on those SNR traces, two representative traces were selected that
in combination with MCS24 result in a 1%, 5%, 10% and 20% target BLER.

The parametrization of the Markov model is as follows:

\- each state persists for 10ms, and

\- a state is good if it has:

\- less than 10% packet loss probability for the 1% and 5% BLER
simulations,

\- less than 40% packet loss probability for the 10% and 20% BLER
simulations.

\- MCS=24 was used for all cases and then users at different \'MBMS
geometry\' were picked to get the different average error rate.

The time in a good state Tg or time in a bad state Tb may be computed by
multiplying the average length of a good (bad) segment by the sampling
period. The probability of the good state and probability of a bad state
may be computed as q/(p+q) and p/(p+q), respectively.

Regarding the MCS selection, the optimum operating MCS strongly depends
on the deployment scenario, including site-to-site distance, operating
frequency, interference conditions at MBSFN area boundaries, etc.
Therefore, one specific value is not suitable. Using two different MCS
cases can give some diversity in the assumptions, hence a good approach
to use the following two values:

\- higher value MCS=21 resulting in RLC-SDU size of 1332 byte.

\- lower value corresponding to 1 bit/s/Hz, with MCS=9 resulting in
RLC-SDU size of 498 byte.

It is additionally from the following list of available simulation
conditions the following were selected as a good candidate
representative:

\- RLC-SDU distance of 10 ms and 40 ms for MCS=21

\- RLC-SDU distance of 10 ms for MCS=9

However, in call cases above, the RLC-SDU size is sufficiently large to
contain multiple speech frames. Therefore, the focus in the simulation
is on the loss patterns and delay. We focus on 10ms and 40ms RLC-SDU
distance in the following. Also, the focus for the scenario here is on
error rates of at most 5%, as it is believed that higher error rates are
unrealistic if no Application Layer FEC is applied, which is the case
for MCPTT speech due to tight latency requirements.

In order to generate appropriate error patterns, the tools attached to
TR 26.947 and as described in Annex B.2 are used. Specifically the
following error patterns are generated.

Subsampling of the traces from 10ms to 40ms is done by dropping 3 out of
4 packets from the error trace.

A.1.3 eNB Scheduling
--------------------

The eNB has scheduling opportunities on the MBMS bearer every 40ms and
transmits all the packets it has received from the MCPTT AS at the next
scheduling opportunity. The eNB is not specified to have a de-jitter
buffer and can be considered to forward whatever packets it has received
in the last 40ms to the UE, without re-ordering or further buffering of
the packets.

Although a de-jitter buffer is not specified at the eNB, the simulations
used introduced two cases: with and without de-jitter buffering at the
eNB.

**Case1 eNB dejitter buffer**: The uplink channel conditions were
simulated with a 1% delay-error profile and the eNB includes a dejitter
buffer to compensate for jitter in the uplink.

The downlink MBMS bearer channel was simulated using the profiles
described in the previous clause for 120 km/h and 3 km/h velocities, and
copied into Table A.1.3.1. The channel models for error rates of 3.22%
and 3.85% at 120km/h were produced using a random error model since
\[20\] did not provide traces at these error rates and it was confirmed
that the errors are very uncorrelated as this velocity.

Table A.1.3-1: Downlink MBMS Error Profiles for different coverage areas
\[20\]

  -------------------------- ---------------------------- ------------
  Downlink Channel Profile   Speech / Fading conditions   Error rate
  v120\_b1                   120 kmph                     0.88 %
  v120\_b3                   120 kmph                     3.22 %
  v120\_b4                   120 kmph                     3.85 %
  v120\_b5                   120 kmph                     5.70 %
  v3\_b1                     3 kmph                       0.81 %
  v3\_b5                     3 kmph                       4.73 %
  -------------------------- ---------------------------- ------------

The downlink MBMS channel packets are scheduled at 40 ms intervals and
there is a playout buffer of length 60ms in the MCPTT UE. If the
scheduler does not have any of the two 20 ms VoIP packets that are
supposed to send in a particular 40 ms interval, it does not substitute
the missing packet with a future packet.

**Case2 no eNB dejitter buffer**: Two uplink scenarios are considered
here under this case.

a\) uplink channel conditions were simulated with same 1% delay-error
profile as in case 1,

b\) uplink channel conditions were simulated with 3% error profile

In both cases, no de-jitter buffer is present in the eNB, all packets
arriving with variable delay jitter in the uplink channel are scheduled
on the downlink MBMS bearer channel at the next 40ms scheduling
opportunity interval. The downlink MBMS bearer channel was simulated
using the same profiles described in Table A.1.3-1 with various error
rates.

The simulations use a de-jitter buffer at the MCPTT UE to compensate for
the jitter introduced in both the uplink and downlink path from the
talker to the listener.
