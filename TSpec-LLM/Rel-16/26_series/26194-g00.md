3.2 General
-----------

The function of the VAD algorithm is to indicate whether each 20 ms
frame contains signals that should be transmitted, e.g. speech, music or
information tones. The output of the VAD algorithm is a Boolean flag
(VAD\_flag) indicating presence of such signals.

3.3 Functional description
--------------------------

The block diagram of the VAD algorithm is depicted in Figure 1. The VAD
algorithm uses parameters of the speech encoder to compute the Boolean
VAD flag (VAD\_flag). This input frame for VAD is sampled at the 6.4 kHz
frequency and thus it contains 256 samples. Samples of the input frame
(s(i)) are divided into sub-bands and level of the signal (level\[n\])
in each band is calculated. Input for the tone detection function are
the normalized open-loop pitch gains which are calculated by open-loop
pitch analysis of the speech encoder. The tone detection function
computes a flag (tone\_flag) which indicates presence of a signalling
tone, voiced speech, or other strongly periodic signal. Background noise
level (bckr\_est\[n\]) is estimated in each band based on the VAD
decision, signal stationarity and the tone-flag. Intermediate VAD
decision is calculated by comparing input SNR
(level\[n\]/bckr\_est\[n\]) to an adaptive threshold. The threshold is
adapted based on noise and long term speech estimates. Finally, the VAD
flag is calculated by adding hangover to the intermediate VAD decision.

Figure 1: Simplified block diagram of the VAD algorithm

### 3.3.1 Filter bank and computation of sub-band levels

The input signal is divided into frequency bands using a 12-band filter
bank (Figure 2). Cut-off frequencies for the filter bank are shown in
Table 1.

Table 1. Cut-off frequencies for the filter bank

  ------------- -----------------
  Band number   Frequencies
  1             0 -- 200 Hz
  2             200 -- 400 Hz
  3             400 -- 600 Hz
  4             600 -- 800 Hz
  5             800 -- 1200 Hz
  6             1200 -- 1600 Hz
  7             1600 -- 2000 Hz
  8             2000 -- 2400 Hz
  9             2400 - 3200 Hz
  10            3200 -- 4000 Hz
  11            4000 -- 4800 Hz
  12            4800 -- 6400 Hz
  ------------- -----------------

Input for the filter bank is a speech frame pointed by the new\_speech
pointer of the speech encoder \[1\]. Input values for the filter bank
are scaled down by one bit. This ensures safe scaling, i.e. saturation
can not occur during calculation of the filter bank.

Figure 2: Filter bank

The filter bank consists of 5^th^ and 3^rd^ order filter blocks. Each
filter block divides the input into high-pass and low-pass parts and
decimates the sampling frequency by 2. The 5^th^ order filter block is
calculated as follows:

$x_{\text{lp}}(i) = 0\text{.}5 \ast (A_{1}(x(2 \ast i)) + A_{2}(x(2 \ast i + 1)))$
(1a)

$x_{\text{hp}}(i) = 0\text{.}5 \ast (A_{1}(x(2 \ast i)) - A_{2}(x(2 \ast i + 1)))$
(1b)

where

x(i) input signal for a filter block

$x_{\text{lp}}(i)$ low-pass component

$x_{\text{hp}}(i)$ high-pass component

The 3^rd^ order filter block is calculated as follows:

$x_{\text{lp}}(i) = 0\text{.}5 \ast (x(2 \ast i + 1) + A_{3}(x(2 \ast i)))$
(2a)

$x_{\text{hp}}(i) = 0\text{.}5 \ast (x(2 \ast i + 1) - A_{3}(x(2 \ast i)))$
(2b)

The filters $A_{1}()$,$A_{2}()$, and$A_{3}()$are first order direct form
all-pass filters, whose transfer function is given by:

$A(z) = \frac{C + z^{- 1}}{1 + C \ast z^{- 1}}$, (3)

where C is the filter coefficient.

Coefficients for the all-pass filters $A_{1}()$,$A_{2}()$, and$A_{3}()$
are COEFF5\_1, COEFF5\_2, and COEFF3, respectively.

Signal level is calculated at the output of the filter bank at each
frequency band as follows:

$\text{level}(n) = \sum_{i = \text{START}_{n}}^{\text{END}_{n}}\left| x_{n}(i) \right|$,
(4)

where:

n index for the frequency band

$x(i)$ sample i at the output of the filter bank at frequency band n

$\text{START}_{n}$ =$\begin{matrix}
\left\{ - \text{6,\ \ 1} \leq n \leq 4 \middle| \right.\ \left\{ - \text{12},\text{\ \ 5} \leq n \leq 8 \middle| \right.\ \left\{ - \text{24,\ \ 9} \leq n \leq \text{11} \middle| \right.\  \\
\end{matrix}$

$\text{END}_{n}$ =$\begin{matrix}
\left\{ 7,\text{\ \ \ \ 1\ } \leq \text{n\ } \leq \text{\ 4} \middle| \right.\ \left\{ \text{15,\ \ 5\ } \leq \text{\ n\ } \leq \text{\ 8} \middle| \right.\ \left\{ \text{31,\ \ 9\ } \leq \text{\ n\ } \leq \text{\ 11} \middle| \right.\  \\
\end{matrix}$

Negative indices of $x(i)$ refer to the previous frame.

### 3.3.2 Tone detection

The purpose of the tone detection function is to detect information
tones, vowel sounds and other periodic signals. The tone detection uses
normalized open-loop pitch gains (ol\_gain), which are received from the
speech encoder. If the pitch gain is higher than the constant TONE\_THR,
tone is detected and the tone flag is set:

if (ol\_gain \> TONE\_THR)

tone\_flag = 1

The open-loop pitch search and correspondingly the tone flag is computed
twice in each frame, except for mode 6.60 kbit/s, where it is computed
only once.

### 3.3.3 VAD decision

The block diagram of the VAD decision algorithm is shown in figure 3.

Figure 3: Simplified block diagram of the VAD decision algorithm

Power of the input frame is calculated as follows:

$\text{frame}_{\text{pow}} = \sum_{i = 0}^{\text{FRAME}_{\text{LEN}}}{s(i) \ast s(i)}$,
(5)

where samples s(i) of the input frame are pointed by the new\_speech
pointer of the speech encoder. Variable pow\_sum is sum of the powers of
the current and previous frames. If pow\_sum is lower than the constant
POW\_TONE\_THR, tone-flag is set to zero.

The difference between the signal levels of the input frame and the
background noise estimate is calculated as follows:

$\text{snr}_{\text{sum}} = \sum_{n = 1}^{\text{12}}{\text{MAX}(1\text{.}0,\frac{\text{level}\left\lbrack n \right\rbrack}{\text{bckr}_{\text{est}}\left\lbrack n \right\rbrack})^{2}}$,
(6)

where:

level\[n\] signal level at band n

bckr\_est\[n\] level of background noise estimate at band n

VAD decision is made by comparing the variable snr\_sum to a threshold.
The threshold (vad\_thr) is adapted to get desired sensitivity depending
on estimated speech and background noise levels.

Average background noise level is calculated by adding noise estimates
at each band except the lowest band:

$\text{noise}_{\text{level}} = \sum_{n = 2}^{\text{12}}{\text{bckr}_{\text{est}}\left\lbrack n \right\rbrack}$
(7)

If SNR is lower that the threshold (MIN\_SPEECH\_SNR), speech level is
increased as follows:

If (speech\_level/noise\_level \< MIN\_SPEECH\_SNR)

Speech\_level = MIN\_SPEECH\_SNR \* noise\_level

Logarithmic value for noise estimate is calculated as follows:

$i\text{log}2\text{\_noise\_level} = \text{log}_{2}(\text{noise\_level})$
(8)

Before logarithmic value from the speech estimate is calculated,
MIN\_SPEECH\_SNR\*noise\_level is subtracted from the speech level to
correct its value in low SNR situations.

$i\text{log}2\text{\_speech\_level} = \text{log}_{2}(\text{speech\_level} - \text{MIN}_{\text{SPEECH}_{\text{SNR}}} \ast \text{noise}_{\text{level}})$
(9)

Threshold for VAD decision is calculated as follows:

> *Vad\_thr = NO\_SLOPE \* (ilog2\_noise\_level - NO\_P1) + THR\_HIGH +
> MIN(SP\_CH\_MAX,\
> MAX(SP\_CH\_MIN, SP\_CH\_MIN + SP\_SLOPE \* (ilog2\_speech\_level --
> SP\_P1))),* (10)

where NO\_SLOPE, SP\_SLOPE, NO\_P1, SP\_P1, THR\_HIGH, SP\_CH\_MAX and
SP\_CH\_MIN are constants.

The variable vadreg indicates intermediate VAD decision and it is
calculated as follows:

if (snr\_sum \> vad\_thr)

vadreg = 1

else

vadreg = 0

#### 3.3.3.1 Hangover addition

Before the final VAD flag is given, a hangover is added. The hangover
addition helps to detect low power endings of speech bursts, which are
subjectively important but difficult to detect.

VAD flag is set to \"1\" if less that hang\_len frames with \"0\"
decision have been elapsed since burst\_len consecutive \"1\" decisions
have been detected. The variables hang\_len and burst\_len are computed
using vad\_thr as follows:

hang\_len = MAX(HANG\_LOW, (HANG\_SLOPE \* (vad\_thr -- HANG\_P1) +
HANG\_HIGH)) (11)

burst\_len = BURST\_SLOPE \* (vad\_thr -- BURST\_P1) + BURST\_HIGH) (12)

The power of the input frame is compared to a threshold (VAD\_POW\_LOW).
If the power is lower, the VAD flag is set to \"0\" and no hangover is
added. The VAD\_flag is calculated as follows:

Vad\_flag = 0;

if (pow\_sum \< VAD\_POW\_LOW)

burst\_count = 0

hang\_count = 0

else

if (vadreg = 1)

> burst\_count = burst\_count + 1
>
> if (burst\_count \>= burst\_len)
>
> hang\_count = hang\_len

VAD\_flag = 1

else

> burst\_count = 0
>
> if (hang\_count \> 0)
>
> hang\_count = hang\_count - 1
>
> VAD\_flag=1

#### 3.3.3.2 Background noise estimation

Background noise estimate (bckr\_est\[n\]) is updated using amplitude
levels of the previous frame. Thus, the update is delayed by one frame
to avoid undetected start of speech bursts to corrupt the noise
estimate. The update speed for the current frame is selected using
intermediate VAD decisions (vadreg) and stationarity counter
(stat\_count) as follows:

if (vadreg for the last 4 frames has been zero)

alpha\_up = ALPHA\_UP1

alpha\_down = ALPHA\_DOWN1

else if (stat\_count = 0)

alpha\_up = ALPHA\_UP2

alpha\_down = ALPHA\_DOWN2

else

alpha\_up = 0

alpha\_down = ALPHA3

The variable stat\_count indicates stationary and its purpose is
explained later in this subclause. The variables alpha\_up and
alpha\_down define the update speed for upwards and downwards,
respectively. The update speed for each band \"n\" is selected as
follows:

if ($\text{bckr}_{\text{est}_{m}}\left\lbrack n \right\rbrack$ \<
$\text{level}_{m - 1}\left\lbrack n \right\rbrack$)

alpha\[n\] = alpha\_up

else

alpha\[n\] = alpha\_down

Finally, noise estimate is updated as follows:

$\text{bckr}_{\text{est}_{m + 1}}\left\lbrack n \right\rbrack = (1\text{.}0 - \text{alpha}\left\lbrack n \right\rbrack) \ast \text{bckr}_{\text{est}_{m}}\left\lbrack n \right\rbrack + \text{alpha}\left\lbrack n \right\rbrack \ast \text{level}_{m - 1}\left\lbrack n \right\rbrack$,
(13)

where:

n index of the frequency band

m index of the frame

Level of the background estimate (bckr\_est\[n\]) is limited between
constants NOISE\_MIN and NOISE\_MAX.

If level of background noise increases suddenly, vadreg will be set to
\"1\" and background noise is not normally updated upwards. To recover
from this situation, update of the background noise estimate is enabled
if the intermediate VAD decision (vadreg) is \"1\" for long enough time
and spectrum is stationary. Stationary (stat\_rat) is estimated using
following equation:

$\text{stat}_{\text{rat}} = \sum_{n = 1}^{\text{12}}\frac{\text{MAX}(\text{STAT\_THR\_LEVEL,MAX}(\text{ave}_{\text{level}_{m}}\left\lbrack n \right\rbrack,\text{level}_{m}\left\lbrack n \right\rbrack))}{\text{MAX}(\text{STAT\_THR\_LEVEL,MIN}(\text{ave}_{\text{level}_{m}}\left\lbrack n \right\rbrack,\text{level}_{m}\left\lbrack n \right\rbrack))}$,
(14)

where:

STAT\_THR\_LEVEL a constant

n index of the frequency band

m index of the frame

ave\_level average level of the input signal

If the stationary estimate (stat\_rat) is higher than a threshold, the
stationary counter (stat\_count) is set to the initial value defined by
constant STAT\_COUNT. If the signal is not stationary but speech has
been detected (VAD decision is \"1\"), stat\_count is decreased by one
in each frame until it is zero.

if (5 last tone flags have been one)

stat\_count = STAT\_COUNT

else

if (8 last internal VAD decisions have been zero) OR (stat\_rat \>
STAT\_THR)

> stat\_count = STAT\_COUNT

else

> if (vadreg) AND (stat\_count ≠ 0)
>
> stat\_count = stat\_count -- 1

The average signal levels (ave\_level\[n\]) are calculated as follows:

$\text{ave}_{\text{level}_{m + 1}}\left\lbrack n \right\rbrack = (1\text{.}0 - \text{alpha}) \ast \text{ave}_{\text{level}_{m}}\left\lbrack n \right\rbrack + \text{alpha} \ast \text{level}_{m}\left\lbrack n \right\rbrack$
(15)

The update speed (alpha) for the previous equation is selected as
follows:

if (stat\_count = STAT\_COUNT)

alpha = 1.0

else if (vadreg = 1)

alpha=ALPHA5

else

alpha = ALPHA4

#### 3.3.3.3 Speech level estimation

First, full-band input level is calculated by summing input levels in
each band except the lowest band as follows:

$\text{in}_{\text{level}} = \sum_{n = 2}^{\text{12}}{\text{level}\left\lbrack n \right\rbrack}$
(16)

A frame is assumed to contain speech if its level if high enough
(MIN\_SPEECH\_LEVEL1), and the intermediate VAD flag (vadreg) is set or
the input level is higher than the current speech level estimate.
Maximum level (sp\_max) from SP\_EST\_COUNT frames is searched. If the
SP\_ACTIVITY\_COUNT number of speech frames is located in within
SP\_EST\_COUNT number of frames, speech level estimate is updated by the
maximum signal level (sp\_max). The pseudocode for the speech level
estimation is as follows:

If (SP\_ACTIVITY\_COUNT \> SP\_EST\_COUNT -- sp\_est\_cnt +
sp\_max\_cnt)

sp\_est\_cnt = 0

sp\_max\_cnt = 0

sp\_max = 0

sp\_est\_cnt = sp\_est\_cnt + 1

if (in\_level \> MIN\_SPEECH\_LEVEL1) AND ((vadreg = 1) OR (in\_level \>
speech\_level))

sp\_max\_cnt = sp\_max\_cnt + 1

sp\_max = MAX(sp\_max, in\_level)

if (sp\_max\_cnt \> SP\_ACTIVITY\_COUNT)

if (sp\_max \> MIN\_SPEECH\_LEVEL2)

if (sp\_max \> speech\_level)

speech\_level = speech\_level + SP\_ALPHA\_UP \* (sp\_max --
speech\_level)

else

speech\_level = speech\_level + SP\_ALPHA\_DOWN \* (sp\_max --
speech\_level)

sp\_max\_cnt = 0

sp\_max = 0

sp\_est\_cnt = 0
