Introduction
============

The on-going commercialization of LTE networks has precipitated
increasing interest in the deployment of eMBMS. As the industry is
considering the first deployments of eMBMS it is important to enhance
the performance and usability of its core features.

After development of the initial MBMS specifications, SA4 has focused
its subsequent work on adding new features to the service. While
application layer FEC usage in support of download and streaming
delivery methods have been specified since Rel-6, those mechanisms have
not been updated to reflect performance improvement developments in more
recent years. Examples of ongoing FEC enhancement efforts are the latest
activities in IETF\'s RMT and FECFRAME working groups. Such FEC
improvements can also provide more efficient support of MBMS use cases.

The objective of this TR is to document the progress of the work item to
investigate and evaluate proposed FEC technologies and, if appropriate,
adopt one which provides the most significant enhancement to the
performance of the MBMS system over the Rel-6 application layer FEC in
MBMS. Aspects of system performance, which would provide benefit to the
system, include, but are not limited to

\- Improving the bandwidth efficiency of streaming and download services
delivery over MBMS

\- Improving the reliability of streaming and download services delivery
over MBMS, e.g. by increasing the amount of tolerable lost packets for a
given FEC overhead

\- Reducing the required computational and memory resources for decoding
in UEs

\- Addressing backward compatibility issues by considering deployments
of pre-Rel-11 MBMS FEC

The evaluation and selection process for the proposed improvements is
documented in this TR.

4 Use of FEC in MBMS
====================

4.1 Introduction
----------------

Application Layer FEC is used in MBMS to compensate remaining losses on
or below the IP layer in unidirectional delivery environments.

4.2 Architecture
----------------

Figure 1 depicts the MBMS network architecture showing MBMS related
entities involved in providing MBMS user services as specified in TS
26.346 \[3\] with special focus to the FEC component. The FEC is
included in the MBMS User Services which are part of the BM-SC on the
network side and MBMS receiver on the UE side. FEC is specifically
included in the File Delivery over Unidirectional Transport (FLUTE)
\[4\] protocol and the Forward Error Correction (FEC) Framework
(FECFRAME) \[6\] protocol.

4.3 MBMS Bearer in UTRAN
------------------------

The MBMS UTRAN Bearer service reuses most of the legacy UMTS protocol
stack in the packet-switched domain. Only minor modifications are
introduced to support MBMS. The IP packets are processed in the Packet
Data Convergence Protocol (PDCP) layer where for example header
compression might be applied. In the Radio Link Control (RLC) the
resulting PDCP-Protocol Data Units (PDUs), generally of arbitrary
length, are mapped to fixed length RLC-PDUs. The RLC layer operates in
unacknowledged mode as feedback links on the radio access network are
not available for point-to-multipoint bearers. Functions provided at the
RLC layer are for example segmentation and reassembly, concatenation,
padding, sequence numbering, reordering and out-of-sequence and
duplication detection. The Medium Access Control (MAC) layer maps and
multiplexes the RLC-PDUs to the transport channel and selects the
transport format depending on the instantaneous source rate. The MAC
layer and physical layer appropriately adapt the RLC-PDU to the expected
transmission conditions by applying, among others, channel coding, power
and resource assignment, and modulation.

4.4 MBMS Bearer in E-UTRAN
--------------------------

The MBMS E-UTRAN Bearer service reuses most of the legacy LTE protocol
stack in the packet-switched domain. Only minor modifications are
introduced to support MBMS. The IP packets are processed in the Packet
Data Convergence Protocol (PDCP) layer where for example header
compression might be applied. In the Radio Link Control (RLC) the
resulting PDCP-Protocol Data Units (PDUs), generally of arbitrary
length, are mapped to fixed length RLC-PDUs. The RLC layer operates in
unacknowledged mode as feedback links on the radio access network are
not available for point-to-multipoint bearers. Functions provided at the
RLC layer are for example segmentation and reassembly, concatenation,
padding, sequence numbering, reordering and out-of-sequence and
duplication detection. The Medium Access Control (MAC) layer maps and
multiplexes the RLC-PDUs to the transport channel and selects the
transport format depending on the instantaneous source rate. The MAC
layer and physical layer appropriately adapt the RLC-PDU to the expected
transmission conditions by applying, among others, channel coding, power
and resource assignment, and modulation.

4.5 Streaming Delivery User Service
-----------------------------------

### 4.5.1 Introduction

The purpose of the MBMS streaming delivery method is to deliver
continuous multimedia data (i.e. speech, audio, video and DIMS) over an
MBMS bearer. The streaming delivery method is particularly useful for
multicast and broadcast of scheduled streaming content. RTP is the
transport protocol for MBMS streaming delivery. RTP provides means for
sending real-time or streaming data over UDP.

TS 26.346 defines a generic mechanism for applying Forward Error
Correction to streaming media. The mechanism consists of three
components:

\(i\) construction of an FEC source block from the source media packets
belonging to one or several UDP packet flows related to a particular
segment of the stream(s) (in time). The UDP flows include RTP, RTCP,
SRTP and MIKEY packets.

\(ii\) modification of source packets to indicate the position of the
source data from the source packet within the source block

\(iii\) definition of repair packets, sent over UDP, which can be used
by the FEC decoder to reconstruct missing portions of the source block.

The details on transport for the streaming delivery service are provided
below.

An alternative way to deliver streaming services over MBMS is the use of
DASH and FLUTE. This is use case is discussed in section 4.7.

### 4.5.2 Transport in streaming delivery service

The MBMS streaming framework operates on RTP packets or more precisely
UDP payloads, incoming at same or different UDP ports. According to TS
26.346, clause 8.2.2, the FEC layer for streaming delivery is based on
top of the UDP layer. The legacy RTP packets and the UDP port
information are used in order to generate FEC repair symbols. Original
UDP payloads become FEC source packets by appending a 3 byte FEC source
payload ID field at the end of each UDP payload. These packets are then
UDP encapsulated and transported on the IP multicast bearer.

According to Figure 2 a copy of these packets is forwarded to the FEC
encoder and is arranged in a source block with row width *T* bytes at
the first empty row. The encoding symbol starts at the beginning of a
new row, but it is preceded by a 3 byte field containing the UDP flow ID
(1 byte) and the length field (2 bytes). In case the length of the
packet is not an integer of the symbol the remaining bytes in the last
row are filled up with zero bytes. The source block is filled up to *k*
rows whereby *k* is flexible and can be changed dynamically for each
source block. The selection of *k* depends on the desired delay, the
available terminal memory and also might depend on aspects such as
desired zapping time in mobile TV applications. Typically for a
streaming service a *protection period* is defined and the value of the
protection period dynamically determines the source block size.

![](media/image4.wmf){width="5.555555555555555in"
height="3.7222222222222223in"}

Figure 2: MBMS Streaming Framework

After processing all packets to be protected within one source block,
the FEC encoder generates *n*-*k* FEC repair symbols of size *T* by
applying FEC. The generated FEC repair symbols can be transmitted
individually or as blocks of symbols as payload of a single UDP packet.
Each FEC source and repair packet contains sufficient information such
that the receiver can correctly insert them in the receiver source and
repair block.

### 4.5.3 Examples

Examples are audio streaming applications or video streaming
applications with bitrates ranging from 32 kbit/s to one or several
MBit/s. The protection period is typically in the range of several
seconds.

4.6 Download Delivery User Service
----------------------------------

### 4.6.1 Introduction

According to TR 26.946, the MBMS Download Delivery Method allows the
error-free transmission of files via the unidirectional MBMS Bearer
Services. The files are \"downloaded\" and stored in the local
files-system of the user equipment. Files may contain multimedia content
or any other binary data. The MBMS Download Delivery Method allows the
transmission of an arbitrary number of files within a single data
transfer phase.

![](media/image5.wmf){width="5.9875in" height="1.53125in"}

Figure 3: Definition of MBMS Download Sessions

Figure 3 is an example of an MBMS User Service based on the Download
Delivery Method. The file transmission events are organized in MBMS
Download Sessions. Each session is started with a File Delivery Table
(FDT) instance, which describes in this example each file within the
MBMS Download Session in terms of file name and file type (MIME Content
Type). The service operator and the actual service determine the timing
of MBMS Download Sessions. Depending on the service type, the MBMS
Download session may require strict or more relaxed time-constraint
delivery of content.

### 4.6.2 Transport in download delivery service

This clause explains briefly how files are constructed for and
transported during a FLUTE session. The BM-SC takes a file, e.g. a video
clip or a still image, which is used as the transport object for FLUTE
(see figure 4). The BM-SC constructs source blocks by breaking the file
into contiguous portions of approximately equal size. Each source block
is broken into source symbols. One or more encoding symbols are carried
as the payload of a FLUTE packet, thus the FLUTE packet size be
divisible by the encoding symbol size. The target FLUTE packet size is
configured by the BM-SC and, together with the file size, is used to
determine the encoding symbol length. When FEC is used it may be
beneficial to include several symbols in each FLUTE packet. Based on the
transport object size, the encoding symbol size and the maximum source
block length, FLUTE calculates the source block structure (i.e., the
number of source blocks and their length).

![](media/image6.wmf){width="5.34375in" height="1.726388888888889in"}

Figure 4: Constructing FLUTE packets

The BM-SC communicates the transport object size, the encoding symbol
size and the file size to the receivers within the FLUTE session
transmission such that the receiver can also calculate the source block
structure in advance of receiving a file.

The FLUTE packet is constructed from FLUTE header and payload containing
one or more encoding symbols.

The distinction between file and transport object is that the file is
the object provided to the BM-SC and played-out or stored at the MBMS
UE. Within the scope of FLUTE sessions, content encoding may be used,
for instance to compress the file with gzip for delivery. In the
presence of FLUTE session content encoding, the file and the transport
object will be different binary objects, and in the absence of content
encoding the transport object will be identical to the file. Any symbol
calculations (including FEC) are performed on transport objects.

### 4.6.3 Download Examples

In a typical use case, multimedia files typically in 3GP or MP4 format
are distributed through download delivery method. In this case the
delivery rate and the media rate may be completely different as no
real-time consumption is considered.

Table 1 shows some typical examples of file sizes for different types of
multimedia content.

Table 1: Examples for Download delivery use cases

  -------- --------------------------------- -------------------------------------
  Number   File Size                         Example
  1        50 kByte (51 200 bytes)           JPEG coded logo
  2        1 MByte (1 048 576 bytes)         AAC encoded audio clip
  3        3 MByte (3 145 728 bytes)         MP3 audio clip
  4        128 MByte (134 217 728) bytes     30 min SD movie coded at 500 kbit/s
  5        1.8 GByte (1 887 436 800) bytes   2 hours HD movie coded at 2 MBit/s
  -------- --------------------------------- -------------------------------------

4.7 Streaming using DASH and Download Delivery User Service
-----------------------------------------------------------

In another use case as indicated in TS 26.346, section 5.6, the download
delivery method may be used to distribute DASH formatted content over
MBMS. MBMS is designed to serve large receive groups with same content.
The MBMS Download Delivery Method is designed to deliver an arbitrary
number of (binary) files via MBMS to a large receiver population. MBMS
Download defines several methods to increase reliability such as file
repair. The download delivery method supports the delivery of media
segments and even media presentation descriptions. Media segment URIs
are described using the FDT in FLUTE.

In this case the media bit-rate and the delivery bitrate are typically
the same to maintain real-time delivery capabilities and therefore the
delivery delay of a segment is typically lower bounded by the segment
duration.

Table 2 shows some typical examples of DASH media segment files for live
services. In these examples, only one representation with constant media
rate is being delivered over download delivery service.

Table 2: Examples for DASH segments

  -------- ---------------------------------------- ---------------------------------
  Number   Segment duration and media rate          FLUTE object (one segment) Size
  1        1 sec DASH segment 250 kbit/s stream     32 kByte (32 768 bytes)
  2        1 sec DASH segment for 1 Mbit/s stream   128 kByte (131 072 bytes)
  3        2 sec DASH segment 250 kbit/s stream     64 kByte (65 536 bytes)
  4        2 sec DASH segment for 1 Mbit/s stream   256 kByte (262 144 bytes)
  5        4 sec DASH segment 250 kbit/s stream     128 kByte (131 072 bytes)
  6        4 sec DASH segment for 1 Mbit/s stream   512 kByte (524 288 bytes)

5 MBMS Bearer Service Channel Modelling
=======================================

5.1 Introduction
----------------

In order to investigate the performance of application layer FEC in the
context of UTRAN and E-UTRAN, appropriate modelling of radio bearers is
necessary.

5.2 Modelling of UTRAN MBMS Bearer
----------------------------------

During the initial MBMS specification phase for Release-6, appropriate
settings for UTRAN bearers for the simulation of FEC parameters had been
defined and are summarized in Table 3.

Table 3: Typical UTRAN bearer parameters

  ----------------------------- ------------------------ --------------------------------------------------

5.3 Modelling of E-UTRAN MBMS Bearer
------------------------------------

To obtain some representative numbers for the performance of an FEC code
in an LTE MBMS environment, some simple models are necessary for AL-FEC
evaluation.

Figure **5** shows the mapping of RLC-SDUs to RLC-PDUs. RLC-SDUs in the
context of MBMS are IP packets. The RLC header is 1 byte if the RLC SDU
consists of 1 IP packet. The header is longer, if multiple IP packets
are multiplexed in an RLC-SDU. A reasonable assumption is to use 3 byte
header of the RLC-PDU assuming a 5 bit sequence number. The loss of one
RLC-PDU results in the loss of all IP packets included in the RLC-PDU.

The MAC PDU consists of a number of MAC SDUs, where a MAC-SDUs is an
RLC-PDU. The MAC multiplexer notifies the RLC layer of the available
bits. The RLC layer would then create an RLC PDU that fits exactly into
the available space in the MAC PDU. There is no need for fragmentation
of MAC SDUs across subframes. Based on this, it can be assumed that the
loss of one MAC-PDU results in the loss of one RLC-PDU.

Figure 5: Mapping of IP packets (RLC-SDUs) to RLC-PDUs (see TS 36.300,
section 6.2.2)

LTE MBMS defines modulations and coding schemes with a MAC-PDU size
ranging from 680 bit to 18336 bit for a 5 MHz bandwidth.

Each MAC-PDU is mapped to a subframe. At allocation level 1, LTE MBMS
can use up to 6 out of the 10 subframes of a 10ms frame. Each subframe
is 1ms.

The interleaving for MBMS in LTE is the same as for regular unicast LTE
delivery of 1 ms.

In communication with RAN1 and RAN2, it was agreed to use a two-state
Markov model for the simulation of LTE RLC-PDU losses as shown in Figure
6:.

The model was parametrized based on the D1 simulation settings of 3GPP
TR 36.942 \[7\] as reported in Table 4.

The simulation is carried out with a 19 sites configuration as shown in
Figure 7:. Each site has 3 cells. All sites have 100% SFN operation. 30
UEs are uniformly dropped into the center site (dark green one) in each
simulation run of 50 sec. In total 900 UEs are dropped and the SNR is
sampled accordingly. The overall SNR distribution is also shown in
Figure 7.

Figure 7: Simulation Grid and SNR distribution

Based on those SNR traces, two representative traces were selected that
in combination with MCS24 result in a 1%, 5%, 10% and 20% target BLER.

The parametrization of the Markov model is as follows:

\- each state persists for 10ms, and

\- a state is good if it has:

\- less than 10% packet loss probability for the 1% and 5% BLER
simulations,

\- less than 40% packet loss probability for the 10% and 20% BLER
simulations.

\- MCS=24 was used for all cases and then users at different \'MBMS
geometry\' were picked to get the different average error rate.

The parameters for Markov channel modelling are provided in Table 5.

The time in a good state Tg or time in a bad state Tb may be computed by
multiplying the average length of a good (bad) segment by the sampling
period. The probability of the good state and probability of a bad state
may be computed as q/(p+q) and p/(p+q), respectively.

Specifically, the following parameters for the LTE MBMS channel
simulations:

\- MCS=9 and MCS=21 with 498 byte RLC-SDU size and 1332 byte RLC-SDU
size.

\- RLC-SDU distance of 10ms and 40ms for MCS=21

\- RLC-SDU distance of 10ms for MCS=9

\- Channel model with Markov model loss rate of 1%, 5%, 10% and 20%

3.2 with speed 3 kph. The table is duplicated below as Table 6 with a

Regarding the MCS selection, the optimum operating MCS strongly depends
on the deployment scenario, including site-to-site distance, operating
frequency, interference conditions at MBSFN area boundaries, etc.
Therefore, one specific value is not suitable. Using two different MCS
cases can give some diversity in the assumptions, hence a good approach
to use the following two values:

\- higher value MCS=21 resulting in RLC-SDU size of 1332 byte.

\- lower value corresponding to 1 bit/s/Hz, with MCS=9 resulting in
RLC-SDU size of 498 byte.

It is additionally from the following list of available simulation
conditions the following were selected as a good candidate
representative:

\- RLC-SDU distance of 10 ms and 40ms for MCS=21

\- RLC-SDU distance of 10 ms for MCS=9

This results in total in 24 different channel configurations as
summarized in Table 8.

6.3 Code Performance
--------------------

### 6.3.1 Introduction

For the evaluation of the code performance, two different methods are
defined.

### 6.3.2 Method 1

#### 6.3.2.1 Evaluation Procedure

Data to be transmitted is partitioned into *K* symbols. These *K*
symbols are used to generate N total symbols to be transmitted, where
*N*\>=*K*. The N symbols are transmitted through an erasure channel with
erasure probability *P*~e~ (on the FEC symbol level). The erasure
channel is IID and it operates on the data symbol by symbol. The IID
erasure channel is illustrated in Figure 8 and Figure 9. Successful
decoding requires at least *K* symbols to be received, but in some cases
additional received symbols may be necessary. Denote the number of
symbols *received* in excess of *K* to be *O*. The decoding failure
probability distribution is a function of *O* and is given as
*P*(*O*)=Pr{decoding with *O* overhead symbols or less fails}.

![](media/image17.wmf){width="4.65in" height="1.4520833333333334in"}

Figure 8: Illustration of the IID erasure channel. Data is passed
through the channel with probability 1-Pe, and erased with probability
Pe.

![](media/image18.wmf){width="6.522916666666666in"
height="1.0291666666666666in"}

Figure 9: Data is passed through the IID erasure channel, with erasure
probability of Pe. Data is delivered to the decoder in the order in
which it was transmitted.

To obtain the distribution *P*(*O*) a statistical evaluation procedure
is proposed as follows:

1)  Fix K, the number of encoded symbols

2)  Fix N, the maximum number of symbols (systematic or repair) to be
    transmitted

3)  Use an Erasure Channel with probability of error Pe for each symbol.

4)  Loop over 5 to 10 for N\_iterations=10,000

5)  Set O= -1 and TX= -1

6)  Set RX=0

7)  While (RX \< K)

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
a.  If (TX+1\>N)

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
i.  Note the case as \"undecodable\"

ii. Goto 5

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
b.  TX=TX+1

c.  Transmit a symbol through the Erasure Channel. If the symbol is
    delivered by the Erasure Channel

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
i.  RX = RX + 1

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
8)  Attempt to Decode with the received symbols

9)  If decoding is not successful

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
a.  If(TX+1\>N)

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
i.  Note O and that the case was \"undecodable\"

ii. Goto 5

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
b.  TX = TX+1

c.  Transmit a symbol through the Erasure Channel. If the symbol is
    delivered by the Erasure Channel

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
i.  O=O+1

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
d.  Goto 8

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
10) If decoding is successful

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
a.  Note O

b.  Goto 5

#### 6.3.2.2 Test Cases

The following test cases are determined for the purpose of evaluating
the code performance.

  CP10     8192   9831   IID *P*~e~=10%
  -------- ------ ------ ----------------

#### 6.3.2.3 Performance Metrics

For each of the above test cases the following performance metrics are
reported for N\_iterations=10,000:

-   The probability that decoding is not successful with O = i symbols,
    P(O=i), where i=\[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\]

-   The probability that decoding is not successful P(undecodable).

-   The probability that decoding is not successful with less than *O*=0
    symbols *P*~f~(*O=0*),

-   The necessary overhead *O\** to achieve *P*~f~(*O=O\**) \<= 0.5, *O
    (P*~f~=0.5)

-   The necessary overhead *O\** to achieve *P*~f~(*O=O\**) \<= 0.1, *O
    (P*~f~=1e-1)

-   The necessary overhead *O\** to achieve *P*~f~(*O=O\**) \<= 0.01, *O
    (P*~f~=1e-2)

-   The necessary overhead *O\** to achieve *P*~f~(*O=O\**) \<= 0.001,
    *O (P*~f~=1e-3)

-   The necessary overhead *O\** to achieve *P*~f~(*O=O\**) \<= 1e-4, *O
    (P*~f~=1e-4)

-   The necessary overhead *O\** to achieve *P*~f~(*O=O\**) \<= 1e-5, *O
    (P*~f~=1e-5)

-   The average symbol overhead E{*O*} for the test case.

### 6.3.3 Method 2

#### 6.3.3.1 Evaluation Procedure

The distribution of the code overhead *O* for different permutations of
received symbols is a relevant measure for the code performance.
Specifically, the failure probability distribution defined as
*P*~f~(*O*)*=* Pr{decoding with exactly *O* overhead symbols fails} is
relevant and may be used to determine the code performance.

To obtain the distribution *P*~f~(*O*) *a statistical evaluation
procedure is proposed based on the following four parameters:*

-   the source block size *K* providing the total number of source
    symbols

-   the maximum encoding symbol ID (ESI) *N* for any repair symbol

Given these numbers the following procedure is proposed to obtain the
*O* for one experiment:

1.  Generate a source block with *K* symbols

2.  Generate *N-K* repair symbols with ESI=*K*+1, \..., *N*

3.  Randomly pick *K* among the *N* symbols

4.  Set *O* to 0

5.  Attempt decoding using the available *K*+*O* encoding symbols. The
    symbols are ordered in sequence for decoding.

6.  If decoding is not successful then

    a.  pick one additional not yet included encoding symbol randomly
        chosen from the *N* symbols.

    b.  Set *O* to *O*+1,

    c.  If *K*+*O* == N+1 then goto 7, else goto 5

7.  Report *O* as the overhead result for this experiment

To obtain the distribution for the necessary overhead *O* at least
10,000 of the above experiments are carried out.

#### 6.3.3.2 Test Cases

The following test cases are determined for the purpose of evaluating
the code performance.

Table 13: Test Cases for Code Performance

  -------- ------ -------
  Number   *K*    *N*
  CP11     32     34

  CP21     8192   9830
  CP22     8192   30000
  -------- ------ -------

Notes that a code does not necessarily have to provide *N* different
encoding symbols, but the code may have less symbols *N\'*. To use such
codes in an environment were *N* symbols are required, the code with
*N\'\<N* independent encoding symbols may repeat encoding symbols to
generate *N* symbols in total.

#### 6.3.3.3 Performance Metrics

For the above test cases CP11-CP22 the following performance metrics are
reported for at least N\_iterations=10,000:

-   The probability that decoding is not successful with *O* = *i*
    symbols, P(*O*=*i*), where *i*=\[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\]

-   The probability that decoding is not successful with less than *O*=0
    symbols *P*~f~(*O=0*),

-   The necessary overhead *O\** to achieve *P*~f~(*O=O\**) \<= 0.5, *O
    (P*~f~=0.5)

-   The necessary overhead *O\** to achieve *P*~f~(*O=O\**) \<= 0.1, *O
    (P*~f~=1e-1)

-   The necessary overhead *O\** to achieve *P*~f~(*O=O\**) \<= 0.01, *O
    (P*~f~=1e-2)

-   The necessary overhead *O\** to achieve *P*~f~(*O=O\**) \<= 0.001,
    *O (P*~f~=1e-3)

-   The necessary overhead *O\** to achieve *P*~f~(*O=O\**) \<= 1e-4, *O
    (P*~f~=1e-4)

-   The necessary overhead *O\** to achieve *P*~f~(*O=O\**) \<= 1e-5, *O
    (P*~f~=1e-5)

-   The average symbol overhead E{*O*} for the test case.

6.4 Download Performance
------------------------

### 6.4.1 Performance Metrics

For download delivery, the FEC Overhead required to achieve 99%
probability of recovery of the file provides a very good indication for
the system level performance.

The FEC Overhead required for 99 % probability of recovery is computed
the Transmission overhead as described in Annex A.1 of this document.

In addition, the following parameters are be reported:

-   The symbol size, T, in bytes

-   The total number of symbols required to represent the source data of
    the object, Kt

-   The number of source blocks, Z

-   The number of sub-blocks in each source block, Ns

-   The maximum number of symbols to be transported in a single packet,
    G

For details refer to RFC 3926 \[4\] and RFC 5053 \[5\].

6.5 UTRAN Streaming Performance
-------------------------------

For RTP-based streaming delivery, as a suitable measure it was
considered to evaluate the maximum supported Media Rate (kbit/s) for
Mean Time Between FEC Block Loss of 1 hour.

**For streaming services simulation we assume the following:**

\- All source RTP packets and UDP repair packets have the same total SDU
size (500 bytes for 64/128 kbit/s, 800 bytes for 256 kbit/s) and number
of symbols *G*: this is not exactly true, but it is considered
sufficient FEC code evaluation.

\- Receiver working memory is large enough to decode the highest bitrate
with the longest protection period.

\- Total bitrate of source data plus repair is always matched to the
bearer rate. Consequently the SDU loss transcript is always the same for
a given stream duration and fixed SDU size, only amount of repair and
the associated maximum possible streaming rate are changing.

Results following the mode as provided in Annex A of TR 26.946 are
expected.

The simulation conditions as provided in Annex A.2 of the present
document are be applied.

In addition, the following parameters are reported:

-   The symbol size, T, in bytes

-   The total number of symbols within a protection period, N\'

-   The number of symbols per packet, G

-   The source block size K

The stream total duration is 24 hours and target Mean Time Between
Failure (MTBF) is set to 1 block error per hours. In addition, the MBTF
over the source block rate may be reported as well. This translates into
a maximum of 24 errors over a 24 hour period.

Table 17 provides a reporting format for UTRAN streaming test cases.

6.6 Streaming Performance over LTE
----------------------------------

For DASH-based streaming delivery, as a similarly suitable measure it is
considered to evaluate the media rate to support a Mean Time Between FEC
Block Loss of 1 hour.

Test cases are considered for 1, 2 and 4 seconds segment duration as
well as bearer bitrates of 260 kbit/s and 1 MBit/s.

The simulation conditions as provided in Annex A.2 of this document are
applied.

In addition, the following parameters are reported:

-   The symbol size, T, in bytes

-   The total number of symbols within a protection period, N\'

-   The number of symbols per packet, G

-   The source block size K

The stream total duration is 24 hours and target Mean Time Between
Failure (MTBF) is set to 1 block error per hours. In addition, the MBTF
over the source block rate may be reported as well. This translates into
a maximum of 24 errors over a 24 hour period.

6.6a Implementation-specific Performance Metrics
------------------------------------------------

Codes not only differ in terms of the code efficiency but also in other
performance criteria. Two important aspects are the required memory for
decoding in the MBMS client as well as the complexity of the considered
decoding algorithm.

Therefore, to judge the *complexity* of a decoding algorithm, the
decoding speed in terms of bit/s on top of a recognized mobile processor
platform running a recognized mobile operating system can provide good
insight into the feasibility of executing the code for mobile
applications.

Another important aspect is the global latency of the global system
(i.e. From the video making to the video rendering on the device). Thus,
encoding complexity is also considered. Therefore, to judge the
*complexity* of an encoding algorithm, the encoding speed in terms of
bit/s on top of a recognized PC platform running a recognized PC
operating system can provide good insight into the impact of the
encoding on the global latency.

In terms of *memory requirements*, a reasonable measure is the required
random access memory in the MBMS client to decode large files, such as
considered in the video delivery use cases from above.

Another performance metric for successful integration into mobile
platforms is the *library footprint* of the code and the footprint of
hardware functions if any.

The complexity and memory requirements is in particular provided for the
following use cases:

-   1.8 GByte at 20% Markov model error rate;

-   4sec @ 1MBit/s streaming at the 20% Markov model error rate;

-   20sec protection period for RTP based streaming at 384 kbit/s and
    the 20% error rate.

### 6.7.3 Test Conditions & Test Procedure

#### 6.7.3.1 Overview Test Platform and Operation Conditions

Figure 10 shows the considered test platform that is to be used.

Figure 10: Test Platform

Figure 10 may suggest that data would be transmitted from laptop to
device and experience errors over the connection. Despite this may be
considered conceptually, in practice a local procedure on the PC is
applied to go from the original PCAP file to an errored PCAP file. Prior
knowledge of the error traces was not used by the FEC encoder or
decoder.

##### 6.7.3.2.1 Summary Test Cases

The following parameters for each test case parameters are specified:

-   FS is the file size in bytes

-   T\' is the FEC payload size.

-   T is the symbol size. Typically T = T\' unless there are multiple
    symbols per packet

-   Kt is the total number of source symbols, i.e., Kt = ceil(FS/T)

-   Z is the total number of source blocks

-   O is the transmission overhead in percent according to the table
    provided by the proponents

-   Nt is the resulting number of total symbols defined as Kt\*(1+O/100)

-   The code specific FEC-OTI (see TS 26.346, clause 7.2.9), e.g. the
    partitioning and sub-blocking parameters

-   SeSt is the sending strategy with IL = Interleaved, n/a not
    applicable and SQ sequential:

    -   Sequential = send all packets for the first source block,
        followed by all packets for the second source block, followed by
        all symbols for the third source block, etc. In addition, send
        all packets in order of the ESI.

    -   Interleaved = send a first packet for each of the Z source
        blocks, followed by a second packet for each of the Z source
        blocks, followed by a third packet for each of the Z source
        blocks, etc.

    -   Unless otherwise noted the symbols within each source block are
        assumed sent in order of increasing ESI-value starting with the
        first source symbol. If any other sending order for symbols
        within each source block is utilized it should be explicitly
        noted under Notes.

It is further expected that of the Z source blocks:

-   the first Z1 have source block size K1 = ceil(Kt/Z)

-   the remaining Z2 have source block size K2 = floor(Kt/Z)

-   and Z1 = Kt -- K2\*Z and Z2=Z-Z1.

The test cases are summarized in Table 19. The test cases LD60\_110,
LD118\_108 and LD119\_109 are done to apply the error streams of lower
loss rates to higher overhead streams. The test cases LD60\_110,
LD\_118\_108 and LD119\_109 are optional.

##### 6.7.3.2.2 Generate FLUTE Packet Test Streams

##### 6.7.3.2.2.1 Process {#process .H6}

To generate the FLUTE packet test streams, the following actions are
applied on the host. Some UNIX operation system is assumed with basic
UNIX commands available.

-   Download the following file http://media.xiph.org/ED/ed-pixlet.mov

-   for each test case LDX according to Table 19

    -   generate segments and MD5

        -   generate temporary file of size FS:\
            head -c \<file size\> ed-pixlet.mov \> data.tmp

        -   create the MD5 for the file:\
            cat data.tmp \| openssl md5 \| awk \'{ print \$2 }\' \>
            ldX.md5

    -   FEC encode to PCAP file as follows

        -   Put FDT for the file in first packet specifying at least the
            following parameters

            -   TOI

            -   FEC-OTI

Note: Content-Location and Content-Length may not be added as they are
not necessary. Transfer-Length in the FEC-OTI is sufficient.

-   encode file into ALC/LCT packets using the test case parameters
    > according to Table 19 for the candidate. The end of session and
    > end of object transmission signalling may be used by setting the A
    > and B flag in the LCT header.

-   provide packets with UDP payload size according to Table 19. The
    ALC/LCT/UDP/IPv4 header is in total 44 bytes.

##### 6.7.3.2.2.2 Output {#output .H6}

The output from this process is, for each test case:

-   TOI and MD5 for the file. Note that the TOI and MD5 are not code
    specific. Note that the TOI in this case is typically 1.

-   PCAP file that contains encoded file preceded with an FDT (for
    details refer to TS 26.346 \[3\], clause 7.2.9). The PCAP file name
    for an example code with code name X is provided in Table 20 along

##### 6.7.3.2.3 Generate Erroneous Packet Streams

##### 6.7.3.2.3.1 LTE Traces {#lte-traces .H6}

Several LTE Error Trace are provided for each test case in the attached
package. The files are named error\_trace\_ld\<testcase\>\_\<trno\>.txt.
The details are summarized in Table 21.

The format of the error traces is as follows

> \<Number L of loss/received events in ASCII\>\[newline\]
>
> *L* x {01}

where *L* is the maximum number of packets in ASCII that the input PCAP
file may have followed on the next line with a string of length *L* made
of ASCII characters \'0\' (packet received) and \'1\' (packet is lost).
One example would be:

> 12
>
> 001011100100

i.e. the length of the of string of 0s and 1s is given by the integer on
the first line.

A process for generating the error traces independently is provided in
Annex B.2.

##### 6.7.3.2.3.2 Apply to LTE traces to PCAP streams {#apply-to-lte-traces-to-pcap-streams .H6}

In order to introduce loss into a controlled manner to the PCAP files
using the Markov error traces, a tool called pcaploss, available in
source code form, is available and attached in the package (including
Makefile). This tool takes a pcap file as input and transforms it into
another altered pcap. The usage message for pcaploss is:

> pcaploss: Usage: ./pcaploss \<pcap\_in\> \<pcap\_out\> \<loss\_file\>
> \[\<\#pkts\>\]

where the format of the loss trace file is according to the format
introduced in section 6.7.3.3.2.1. If the optional integer argument
\#pkts is present, only the number of packets indicated by \#pkts will
be read in from pcap\_in before pcaploss closes the output file and
stops.

The pcap for transmission may be prepped with the right MAC/IP addresses
for both sender and receiver. On the sender side MAC and IP can be
obtained with command \'ipconfig/ all\' on Windows, e.g.:

where hardware and IP addresses are 02:65:64:60:6E:0B and 192.168.42.149
respectively. On the receiver side a multicast IP address and associated
MAC could be 230.20.20.10 and 01:00:5e:66:14:14:0a.

With the information above and for each test case LDY in Table 26 and
each trace number trno, the following process is applied:

> errortrace\_ldZ\_\<trno\>.txt

Note that the integration of the Ethernet and IP addresses with
tcprewrite is optional and may only be done absence of any other
knowledge. tcprewrite is included in the TCPreplay suite, for details
refer to section B.6.2.

##### 6.7.3.2.3.3 Output {#output-1 .H6}

The outputs of this process are *S* PCAP file for each test case. The

##### 6.7.3.2.5 Evaluation

##### 6.7.3.2.5.1 General {#general .H6}

After all test cases are completed the output files as presented in
Table 23 are available. These files may be moved back to the host for
evaluation.

##### 6.7.3.2.5.2 Correct Decoding {#correct-decoding .H6}

To verify that decoding was successful for each test case or to identify
the number of unsuccessful attempts, the result files
ldY\_codeX\_ldZ\_\<trno\>.out are collected and for each one it is
compared if the TOI and MD5 are identical with ldY.md5. If not
identical, one error event is recorded.

##### 6.7.3.2.5.3 Performance Evaluation {#performance-evaluation .H6}

The output will then be extracted from the two files which include the
output from the time command similar as seen below:

Command being timed: \"ld\_decoder\"

**User time (seconds): 1.49**

**System time (seconds): 0.36**

**Percent of CPU this job got: 73%**

**Elapsed (wall clock) time (h:mm:ss or m:ss): 0m 2.52s**

Average shared text size (kbytes): 0

Average unshared data size (kbytes): 0

Average stack size (kbytes): 0

Average total size (kbytes): 0

**Maximum resident set size (kbytes): 165456**

Average resident set size (kbytes): 0

Major (requiring I/O) page faults: 1

Minor (reclaiming a frame) page faults: 21740

Voluntary context switches: 9659

Involuntary context switches: 10442

Swaps: 0

File system inputs: 0

File system outputs: 0

Socket messages sent: 0

Socket messages received: 0

Signals delivered: 0

Page size (bytes): 4096

Exit status: 0

The relevant entries here are \"system time\", \"user time\" (the sum of
which is to be reported as the processing cost), and \"Maximum resident
set size\". The memory usage to be reported is 1/4 of that given as the
\"Maximum resident set size\" in an unpatched busybox 1.19.0. The reason
for this division by 4 is that busybox has a bug which causes it to
overestimate memory usage by a factor of 4, just like the GNU time
utility from which it is presumably inheriting this mistake. See the bug
report [here]{.underline} (see note).

NOTE:
http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-gnu-utils/2008-12/msg00047.html

The following performance data measurement is proposed:

-   Generate the numbers from above for the considered test case

-   Generate the numbers from above for a zero loss trace

-   Report the following numbers for each test case and the zero loss
    trace:

    -   *U*: User time (seconds)

    -   *S*: System time (seconds)

    -   *P*: Percent of CPU this job got

    -   *W*: Elapsed (wall clock) time (h:mm:ss or m:ss):

    -   *M*: Maximum resident set size (kbytes)

-   Generate the following numbers for performance evaluation based on
    the above results and the object size *F* (in bytes) for each test
    case and trace number:

    -   Speed: Average decoding speed (in MBit/s):
        *F\*8*/(1000000\*(*U*+*S*))

    -   Time1: Decoding time (in s): *U*+*S*

    -   Time2: weighted elapsed time (in s): *P*\**W*/100

    -   Memory: Peak memory usage (in MBytes): *M*/4096

##### 6.7.3.2.5.4 Performance Documentation {#performance-documentation .H6}

The following values are to be reported for each test case be using the
results from each **trno** = 0, \..., *S*-1 and the error free decoding:

-   *Np* the total number of packets used for decoding

-   *E* the total number of file delivery attempts that failed (should
    be 0)

-   AvSpeed the average speed over all *S* decoding attempts

-   AvTime1 the average decode time over all *S* decoding attempts

-   AvTime2 the weighted elapsed time over all *S* decoding attempts

-   MinSpeed the minimum speed over all *S* decoding attempts

-   MaxTime1 the maximum decoding over all *S* decoding attempts

-   MaxTime2 the weighted elapsed time over all *S* decoding attempts

-   MaxMem the maximum memory over all *S* decoding attempts

-   AvCPU the average value of *P* over all *S* decoding attempts

-   EfSpeed the speed for error-free decoding attempt

-   EfTime1 the Time for error-free decoding attempt

-   EfTime2 the Time for error-free decoding attempt

-   EfMem the Memory for error-free decoding attempt

Note that

-   the error-free results are not required, but recommended to be
    provided.

-   the data are obviously expected to be provided for the network2sd
    (in Table 25) and ld\_decoder process (in Table 24).

-   The test cases LD60\_110, LD118\_108 and LD119\_109 are optional

##### 6.7.3.3.2 Generate FLUTE Packet Test Streams

##### 6.7.3.3.2.1 Process {#process-2 .H6}

In order to generate the FLUTE Packet Test streams, the following
actions are to be applied on the host

-   Download the following file http://media.xiph.org/ED/ed-pixlet.mov

-   for each test case LSX according to Table 26

    -   generate segments and MD5

        -   split the file in to Y segments, each of size S

        -   create the MD5 for each of the segments and create a file
            that lists the TOI and the MD5

        -   the shell script in section 0 can be used for this purpose.
            It creates as output the segment number as well as the MD5
            for the segment

    -   FEC encode to PCAP file as follows:

        -   Provide FDT for each segment just before first packet of a
            segment specifying at least the following parameters

            -   TOI

            -   FEC-OTI

> Note:

-   Content-Location and Content-Length are not added as they are not
    necessary. Transfer Encoding is sufficient.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   encode each segment sequentially with increasing TOI numbers *1*
    > \... *Y* into ALC/LCT packets using the test case parameters
    > according to Table 26 for the candidate

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   number of source symbols K,

-   number of transmitted symbols N,

-   symbol size T,

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   sub-blocking parameters if needed

> Note: End of session and end of object transmission signalling may be
> used by setting the A and B flag in the LCT header.

-   for all ALC/LCT packets with TOI not equal to 0,

    -   provide packets with UDP payload size according to Table 26. The
        ALC/LCT/UDP/IPv4 header is in total 44 bytes.

    -   If in doubt or unclear what to use, include the timing for the
        real-time bitrate, i.e. 1 packet every according to the packet
        interval in Table 26. Note that the tool pcaploss rewrites
        correctly the packet timestamps with the right transmission time
        interval.

-   for all ALC/LCT packets with TOI equal to 0, i.e. FDT packets

    -   provide packets with UDP payload size according to Table 26. The
        ALC/LCT/UDP/IPv4 header is in total 44 bytes.

    -   If in doubt or unclear what to use, include a timing that is 50%
        of the packet interval in Table 26 earlier than the one in the
        first packet of the object with the TOI included in this FDT.
        Note that the tool pcaploss rewrites correctly the packet
        timestamps with the right transmission time interval.

##### 6.7.3.3.2.2 Output {#output-3 .H6}

The output from this process is for each test case:

-   File that contains TOI and MD5 for each of the segments

-   PCAP file that contains a sequence of segments prefixed with a
    single multi-packet FDT that summarizes the entire sequence. The
    PCAP file name for a code with code name X is provided in Table 27
    along with the total number of packets

##### 6.7.3.3.3 Generate Erroneous Packet Streams

##### 6.7.3.3.3.1 LTE Traces {#lte-traces-1 .H6}

One LTE Error Trace is provided for each test case in the attached
package. The files are named error\_trace\_ls\<testcase\>.txt. The
details are summarizes in Table 28.

The format of the error traces is as follows

> \<Number L of loss/received events in ASCII\>\[newline\]
>
> *L* x {01}

where *L* is the maximum number of packets that the input pcap file may
have followed on the next line with a string made of characters \'0\'
(packet received) and \'1\' (packet is lost) of length L. One example
would be:

> 12
>
> 001011100100

i.e. the length of the of string of 0s and 1s is given by the integer on
the first line.

A process for generating the error traces independently is provided in
Annex B.

##### 6.7.3.3.3.2 Apply to LTE traces to PCAP streams {#apply-to-lte-traces-to-pcap-streams-1 .H6}

In order to introduce loss into a controlled manner to the PCAP files
using the Markov error traces, a tool called pcaploss, available in
source code form, is available and attached in the package (including
Makefile). This tool takes a pcap file as input and transforms it into
another altered pcap. The usage message for pcaploss is:

> pcaploss: Usage: ./pcaploss \<pcap\_in\> \<pcap\_out\> \<loss\_file\>
> \[\<\#pkts\>\]

where the format of the loss trace file is according to the format
introduced in clause 6.7.3.3.2.1. If the optional integer argument
\#pkts is present, only the number of packets indicated by \#pkts will
be read in from pcap\_in before pcaploss closes the output file and
stops.

The pcap for transmission may be prepped with the right MAC/IP addresses
for both sender and receiver. On the sender side MAC and IP can be
obtained with command \'ipconfig/ all\' on Windows, e.g.:

where hardware and IP addresses are 02-65-64-60-6E-0B and 192.168.42.149
respectively. On the receiver side a multicast IP address and associated
MAC could be 230.20.20.10 and 01:00:5e:66:14:14:0a.

With the information above and for each test case LSY(\_Z) in Table 26,
the following process is applied:

> ./tcprewrite \--distip=0.0.0.0/0:230.20.20.10 \--enet-dmac=
> 01:00:5e:66:14:14:0a \--srcip=0.0.0.0/0:192.168.42.149

> temp.cap
>
> ./pcaploss temp.cap ldY\_codeX\_ldZ\_\<trno\>.cap
> errortrace\_ldZ\_\<trno\>.txt

Note that the integration of the Ethernet and IP addresses with
tcprewrite is optional and may only be done absence of any other
knowledge. tcprewrite is included in the TCPreplay suite, for details
refer to Annex B.6.2.

##### 6.7.3.3.3.3 Output {#output-4 .H6}

The output of this process is one PCAP file for each test case. The PCAP
files are summarized in Table 29. The length of the PCAP file depends on
the loss statistics.

##### 6.7.3.3.4 Generate Device Performance Measures

##### 6.7.3.3.4.1 Setup {#setup-1 .H6}

The following device/operating conditions are used:

NOTE: \"Trade name(s) of product(s)\] are an example(s) of a suitable
product(s) available commercially. This information is given for the
convenience of users of the present document and does not constitute an
endorsement by 3GPP of these product(s).\"

-   Device:

    -   Samsung Galaxy S2™ (GT-I9100) Smartphone, running Android 4.0.3.
        The processor is a Dual-core Exynos 4210 1.2GHz processor ARM
        Cortex-A9.

    -   Root access is applied to the device, for details see Annex B.3.

    -   ls\_decoder executable for FEC decoding available on the device,
        for details on functionalities, see clause 6.7.3.3.3.2.

    -   verifysegm for generating the md5 or a received segment push the
        data to stdout with TOI and length. For details on
        functionalities, see Annex B.8.

    -   push the Unix \'time\' command on the device, for details see
        Annex B.4.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   The host PC:

    -   can be any OS, but typically Windows or Linux

    -   The host PC is connected to the Device using USB tethering
        through an interface. It is assumed that the interface has
        assigned name Samsung.

    -   the host does have a functionality installed that permits to
        push the stored PCAP files to the device. For details, see Annex
        B.6. In the following it is assumed that ColaSoft Packet Player
        is available.

-   The details of connecting device and host PC are provided in Annex
    B.5.

##### 6.7.3.3.4.2 Decoder {#decoder .H6}

The ls\_ecoder executable receives its input data via the network
interface card (UDP/ALC/LCT packets) and writes on stdout decoded source
block.

If correction of the segment is successful, this application writes on
stdout:

> \[ TOI (32-bit) \| length (32-bit) \| \<sequence of segment bytes\>\]

where TOI is the segment Transport Object Identifier followed by the
length of the decoded segment in bytes and the actual recovered segment
data. TOI and length are in network-byte order.

Note that the proponent need not use the provided verifysegm, but
provide its own verification program. In this case the interface between
the decoder and the verification program may for example use the segment
name instead of the TOI.

##### 6.7.3.3.4.3 Process {#process-3 .H6}

For each test case LSX from Table 26, the following processes are
carried out in the following sequence:

-   On the device start the following process in directory
    /data/data/berserker.android.apps.sshdroid/home with device Wifi IP
    of 192.168.2.102 and an ssh server running on port 2222:

1.  ssh -p 2222 root\@192.168.2.102

2.  When asked for password, type \'admin\'

3.  time -v ls\_decoder 2\> time.txt \| time -v verifysegm \> out.txt

-   On the host start the Colasoft Packet Player with the following:

    -   Adapter: Samsung

    -   Packet File: Add -\> File of type: libpcap (\*.cap)

    -   Select file lsY\_codeX\_lsZ\_\<trno\>.cap

    -   Click button Play

-   After termination at the device, the following is carried out on the
    host:

> scp --P 2222
> root\@192.168.2.102:/data/data/berserker.android.apps.sshdroid/home/out.txt
> lsY\_codeX\_lsZ.out
>
> scp --P 2222
> root\@192.168.2.102:/data/data/berserker.android.apps.sshdroid/home/time.txt
> lsY\_codeX\_lsZ.time

##### 6.7.3.3.4.4 Error-Free Process {#error-free-process-1 .H6}

The same process as described in section 6.7.3.3.3.3 is carried out for
the error-free pcap files. To do so, all files lsY\_codeX\_lsZ.\* are
replaces by lsY\_codeX.\*.

##### 6.7.3.3.4.5 Output {#output-5 .H6}

The output of this process is one performance file and one result file
for each test case. The files are summarized in Table B.1.

##### 6.7.3.3.5 Evaluation

##### 6.7.3.3.5.1 General {#general-1 .H6}

After all test cases are completed the output files as presented in
Table 30 are available. These files are moved back to the host for
evaluation.

##### 6.7.3.3.5.2 Correct Decoding {#correct-decoding-1 .H6}

The number of successfully decoded segments can be computed as follows
(on a UNIX machine):

cat lsY\_codeX.md5 lsY\_codeX.out \| sort \| uniq --d \| wc --l

##### 6.7.3.3.5.3 Performance Evaluation {#performance-evaluation-1 .H6}

The output of lsY\_codeX(\_lsY).time will be something like this:

Command being timed: \"ls\_decoder\"

User time (seconds): 1.49

System time (seconds): 0.36

Percent of CPU this job got: 73%

Elapsed (wall clock) time (h:mm:ss or m:ss): 0m 2.52s

Average shared text size (kbytes): 0

Average unshared data size (kbytes): 0

Average stack size (kbytes): 0

Average total size (kbytes): 0

Maximum resident set size (kbytes): 165456

Average resident set size (kbytes): 0

Major (requiring I/O) page faults: 1

Minor (reclaiming a frame) page faults: 21740

Voluntary context switches: 9659

Involuntary context switches: 10442

Swaps: 0

File system inputs: 0

File system outputs: 0

Socket messages sent: 0

Socket messages received: 0

Signals delivered: 0

Page size (bytes): 4096

Exit status: 0

The relevant entries here are system time, user time (the sum of which
is to be reported as the processing cost), and Maximum resident set
size. The memory usage to be reported is 1/4 of that given as the
Maximum resident set size in an unpatched busybox 1.19.0. The reason for
this division by 4 is that busybox has a bug which causes it to
overestimate memory usage by a factor of 4, just like the GNU time
utility from which it is presumably inheriting this mistake. See the bug
report [here]{.underline} (see note).

NOTE:
http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-gnu-utils/2008-12/msg00047.htm

The following performance data measurement is proposed:

-   Generate the numbers from above for the considered test case

-   Generate the numbers from above for a zero loss trace

-   Report the following numbers for each test case and the zero loss
    trace:

    -   *U*: User time (seconds)

    -   *S*: System time (seconds)

    -   *P*: Percent of CPU this job got

    -   *W*: Elapsed (wall clock) time (h:mm:ss or m:ss):

    -   *M*: Maximum resident set size (kbytes)

-   Generate the following numbers for performance evaluation based on
    the above results and the segment duration *D* (in seconds), the
    media bitrate *R* (in kBit/s), and the duration of the media data
    *t* (in seconds):

    -   Speed: Average decoding speed (in MBit/s):
        *R*\**t*/(1000\*(*U*+*S*))

    -   Latency: Average decoding latency (in ms):
        *D*\*(1000\*(*U*+*S*))/*t*

    -   Memory: Peak memory usage (in MBytes): *M*/4096

##### 6.7.3.3.5.4 Performance Documentation {#performance-documentation-1 .H6}

The performance should be documented according to Table 31. The right
three columns document the performance for error-free transmission. Also
the values for *U*, *S*, *P*, *W* and *M* should be provided.

9 Other FEC Enhancements 
========================

9.1 Introduction
----------------

During the work item on EMM-EFEC other technologies beyond pure codes
were submitted. The technologies are documented in this clause.

9.2 Graceful Degradation (GD) - FEC
-----------------------------------

### 9.2.1 Introduction

Graceful Degradation (GD)-FEC sub-layer is performed at the first
process in Transport layer and directly applied for the received data
from the Media layer. GD-FEC mechanism provides unequal error protection
(UEP) technique that protects important parts of media bit stream(s)
more strongly than others. FEC layer is located in the lower and at the
RTP/RCTP or SRTP sections to fully protect the packets and headers
generated in the upper sub-layers. GD-FEC sub-layer may also be located
in above FLUTE protocol layer when it used for DASH-based streaming
service over FLUTE.

### 9.2.2 GD-FEC Operations and Requirements

When a system needs to supply a certain level of service quality for
radio impaired mobiles that are suffered frequent burst losses in
broadcasting, it may adopt GD-FEC and in this case, the system should
inform all mobiles about the following information using in-band and/or
out-band signalling:

\- The kind of media data that is be protected by GD-FEC (e.g. audio,
text, ...)

\- The location of GD-FEC source and repair packets in the source flows

\- The GD-FEC format and encoded method

The portion of the source data protected by GD-FEC (referred to as
target source) should be relatively small (e.g. audio data can be chosen
for the target source, because the size of audio data is typically below
10% of that of video data) so that the required amount of repair packets
can be small. With an enough amount of repair data, GD-FEC may provide a
media protection with a low burden in computational complexity.

In GD-FEC, the encoding delay introduced by the GD-FEC encoder may
increase, but may still be good enough for typical media coding systems.
However, for receivers ignoring the GD-FEC system should not add
additional decoding delay. Next section describes an example of GD-FEC
implementation which fulfils these requirements.

In fact, GD-FEC can be flexibly adopted as: Good receiving status
mobiles can be configured to not use GD-FEC decoding, however, bad
receiving status mobiles may use GD-FEC repair packets when GD-FEC is
deployed in media systems at the expense of possibly increased delay.

### 9.2.3 GD-FEC Encoding/Decoding Examples

This section describes an example of GD-FEC implementation which fulfils
the requirements described in previous section. In this example, the
audio packets are selected as the target source data for GD-FEC
protection.

There are two important terminologies for GD-FEC: Encoded multimedia
data group (EMDG) and GD-FEC encoding group (GDEG) as shown in figure
11. EMDG is a packet group that contains a group of media data providing
a certain amount of information (e.g. all media data in one picture
frame unit). GDEG is defined as a group of L EMDGs where L=1, 2, ...
(e.g. L=4 in figure 11).

![](media/image20.png){width="6.503472222222222in" height="2.625in"}

Figure 11: Encoded Multimedia Data Group (EMDG) and GD-FEC Encoding
Group (GDEG)

It should be noted that, an important requirement for the GD-FEC
described in previous section is the decoding delay of GD-FEC. Figure 12
shows none or minimum delay for the GD-FEC decoding whereas enough delay
is yielded in the GD-FEC encoding (in the case of *L*=4).

![](media/image21.wmf){width="6.445833333333334in" height="4.35in"}

Figure 12: None or Minimum Delay GD-FEC Decoding Whereas Enough Delay
Yielded\
by GD-FEC Encoding (e.g. L=4)

Another example of the low latency GD-FEC scheme is shown in Figure 13.
In the figure, the duration of a GD-FEC encoding group is the same as
that required to process a FLUTE segment file. With this alignment, an
additional processing delay for the GD-FEC encoding is not required
because it can be performed in the time slot of the FLUTE segment file
process. Using the same reasoning, an additional processing delay for
the GD-FEC decoding is also not required. The FLUTE segment packet units
are smaller units than FLUTE file segments. Interleaving can be
performed with these FLUTE segment packet units (e.g. predetermined
random order sending). In the total streaming file for the FLUTE, the
source data packets have headers and these headers are more important
than others; furthermore, they can be GD-FEC target sources for stronger
protection (e.g. UEP for the headers).

![](media/image22.wmf){width="6.689583333333333in" height="2.4125in"}

Figure 13: GD-FEC encoding delay aligned with the FLUTE segment file
processing delay (e.g. the duration of the FLUTE file segment equals
that of the GD-FEC encoding group)

### 9.2.4 Conclusion on GD-FEC

Although the study of GD-FEC during the EMM-EFEC work item produced
results that showed positive benefits in some use cases and
environments, it was considered that this technology could not be
adopted within a normative specification at this time. Further
consideration of GD-FEC may be made during later releases as a solution
to various use cases including, but not limited to:

\- Small segment delivery over FLUTE

\- Low latency for good covered mobiles and increased latency for UEs in
worse coverage

\- Fast start-up

\- OTA (over the air overheads)

10 Conclusions
==============

There were significant investigations into the capabilities, performance
and suitability of the qualifying EMM-EFEC candidates. The attached
results and verification documents present a full view of the work
performed in this area.

6330 and RS+LDPC each received significant support as MBMS Application
Layer FEC (AL-FEC).

As a final conclusion of the work, no new AL-FEC code was adopted.

The existing FEC provides sufficient features and performance to ensure
successful operation of MBMS User Services.

######### Annex A: Simulation Conditions 

A.1 Simulation Procedure for download delivery
==============================================

For file downloads simulations the following assumptions are made:

\- All source blocks have the same size, i.e. the size the largest
source blocks (this would slightly overestimate FEC overhead but
simplifies simulation code)

\- The working size memory is 256KB for UTRAN MBMS and 1MB for LTE MBMS

The download procedure is:

-   Generate IP packet loss transcripts, one per user, with mapping
    algorithm according to the access technology and the IP packet size
    according to the table. The transcript length has to be long enough
    to cover transmission of the biggest file subject to maximum
    simulated loss and transmission overhead to meet target success
    rate.

-   Using the following as input: file size F, payload size P, receiver
    memory size WS. Then compute the number of source blocks Z and their
    size in symbols KT, the number of symbols per packet G (always 1 for
    Ideal) according to the following schemes per FEC:

> \- In the case of Ideal code, there is always a single source block
> with symbol size T=P with a total of K=ceil(F/P) symbols.
>
> \- In the case of Raptor, the parameters are computed using Section
> 9.1 Block Partitioning Algorithm of RFC 5052.
>
> \- In case of other codes, the algorithm for computing the different
> parameters should be provided

-   For each user U do

    -   Encoding symbol index I = 0

    -   Until all Z source block are received

        -   For each Z source block

            1.  Add a received symbol of ESI I for the block if not lost
                according to lost transcript A for user

            2.  Move loss transcript pointer to next item

            3.  If the block is not decoded and number of received
                symbols is equal or bigger than K\*T do:

                -   Try decoding with the set of received ESIs

                -   If successful, mark block as decoded, record number
                    of symbols necessary for this block

        -   I = I + 1

    -   Find maximum of necessary symbols maxSymbol across Z blocks for
        user U, report Transmission overhead as (maxSymbol\*T \*Z/ F) in
        percent

-   Rank all users according to their Transmission overhead

-   If X is the target success rate, keep the last (1 -- X) \* N last
    users where N is the number of simulated users

-   Report Transmission overhead (reported as FEC overhead in TR26.346)
    of the first user (i.e. with lowest FEC overhead) from remaining
    users of step 5.

A.2 Simulation Procedure for streaming delivery
===============================================

**The streaming simulation procedure is:**

-   Select a streaming service with source data rate and stream duration
    (24 hours)

-   Generate IP packet loss transcripts, one per user, with mapping
    algorithm according to the access technology and the IP packet size
    according to the table. The transcript length has to be long enough
    to cover transmission of the whole stream duration.

-   Compute number of symbols N per protection period for FEC under
    consideration (for RFC5053, this is the number of packets if G \> 1)

-   R = 0, the number of repair symbols

-   Loop 1: Until number of segment in error E is less than target error
    maxE do:

    -   K = N -- R, where K = number of symbols for block

    -   For all segments in stream do:

        -   For ESI = 0 up to N-1 do:

            -   If SDU is received according to loss transcript A,
                record ESI as received

        -   Try decoding with set of received ESI

        -   If not successful, E = E + 1

        -   If E \> maxE, R = R + 1, restart Loop 1

-   Record last value of K as maxK

-   Report maximum streaming rate as (G\*K\*T\*8 / protection period )
    where T is the symbol size.

B.3 Root access for Galaxy S2
=============================

Here is procedure to root the Samsung S2: 

-   http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1501719

Once the phone is rooted, to turn on performance mode and disable the
second CPU core:

-   cd /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq

-   cat scaling\_governor

    -   this will tell the current mode (on-demand or performance)

-   echo performance \> scaling\_governor

    -   turn on performance mode. *echo ondemand to turn off*

    -   NOT a sticky command i.e. value resets to ondemand after reset

        -   note: *performance* mode will keep it at 1.5GHz, even at
            idle

        -   In *ondemand* mode - at idle, without a data transfer or
            anything else running on the device, cpu0 should be running
            at much lower speed

-   cat scaling\_cur\_freq

    -   display current clock frequency in kHz

-   cd /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu1/cpufreq

    -   to check the settings for cpu1

        -   NOTE: if core 1 is not on, the cpufreq directory won\'t
            exist

-   cd /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu1; cat online

    -   if it outputs 1, cpu1 is still up

-   echo 0 \> /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu1/online

    -   shuts a given cpu down

-   chmod 444 /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu1/online

    -   ensures that the cpu is not restarted again (needs to be finally
        verified)

B.4 Time Command on Android Device
==================================

To enable the time command on an android device, the Busybox needs to be
installed.

\- ARM pre-compiled busybox can be downloaded from
<http://busybox.net/downloads/binaries/1.19.0/> (the ARMv6l works well
on Android).

\- Then push it on the phone by

\- renaming it \'time\': adb push busybox-armv6l /data/local/tmp/time

\- make sure it\'s executable (adb shell chmod 0777
/data/local/tmp/time).

B.5 USB tethering of Android Devices
====================================

B.5.1 Requirements
------------------

Android device running 2.2 Froyo or higher

B.5.2 Enable USB tethering on Android
-------------------------------------

\- Switch ON \"Tethering\" option in \"Setting-\>Wireless and Networks.

You can check the IP address of the newly created interface using the
\"adb\" tool from the Android SDK. Once in the Android shell use the
\"netcfg\" command. The IP address should be \"192.168.42.129\"
(Hardcoded in Android source code).

B.5.3 Network structure
-----------------------

Android terminal Linux/Win PC

========================= =========================

\|  \|  \| \|

\| \<\<connection status\>\> \|  \| \<\<connection status\>\> \|

\| - USB Tethering mode \|  \| - Recognizes Android \|

\| \| \| terminal as NIC \|

\| \<\<interface\>\> \| USB Connection \|  \|

\| - New NIC \|\<==============\> \| \<\<interface\>\>  \|

\| 192.168.42.129 \|  \| - New NIC \| 

\| \| \| IP from Android \|

\| \| \| device (DHCP) \|

\| \<\<action\>\> \| \| \<\<action\>\> \|

\|- Receive multicast \| \|- Send multicast \|

\| packets (pcap) \| \| packets (pcap) \|

========================= =========================

B.6 Play a PCAP
===============

B.6.1 Windows
-------------

In order to play a PCAP file on a Windows based host, one can use the
following tools:

-   http://www.colasoft.com/packet\_player/

B.6.2 Unix & Win32/Cygwin
-------------------------

In order to play a pcap file on a Unix based host, one can use the
following tools:

-   TCP Replay as available here: http://tcpreplay.synfin.net/

-   or here as source http://sourceforge.net/projects/tcpreplay/

B.7 Android SSH server
======================

An SSH server for Android is SSHDroid available from Google Marketplace.
Search for \'SSHDroid\'. Once installed, make sure to configure port
2222 in its settings. For some reason when SSHDroid defaults to port 22
when running in root mode, it is not possible to ssh in. Port 2222 has
no such restriction.

B.8 Verify Segment Decoding
===========================

This tool is attached in source code in verifysegm.zip with compilation
instructions for Android.

The tool reads from stdin a repeated sequence

> \[ TOI (32-bit) \| length (32-bit) \| \<sequence of segment bytes\>\]

where TOI is the segment Transport Object Identifier followed by the
length of the decoded segment in bytes and the actual recovered segment
data. TOI and length are in network-byte order.

For each such triplet, the output is

> \<TOI as a human readable integer\> \<one space\> \<human readable hex
> MD5\> \<newline\>

The output is human readable, unlike the input. Exactly one such line is
printed to stdout per TOI (assuming the TOI is received a single time).

Example input in hex:

> 00 00 00 01 00 00 00 03 a0 a1 a2 00 00 00 02 00 00 00 01 b0
>
> (end of file after that.)

This corresponds to two objects, first having TOI 1, and a length of 3
bytes, the file content being (in hex) a0 a1 a2, and the second one
being TOI 1 the file containing a single byte b0.

The output produced by that should be:

> 1 b33326d4c1d789e9651d526f420b6801
>
> 2 ec655b6da8b9264a7c7c5e1a70642fa7

and no other line.
