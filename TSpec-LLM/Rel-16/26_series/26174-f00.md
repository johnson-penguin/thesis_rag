3.1 Definitions
---------------

For the purposes of the present document, the terms and definitions
given in TS 26.190 \[2\], TS 26.091 \[6\], TS 26.192 \[3\], TS 26.193
\[4\] and TS 26.194 \[5\] apply.

-----------------

For the purposes of the present document, the following abbreviations
apply:

 

4 General
=========

Digital test sequences are necessary to test for a bit exact
implementation of the adaptive multi-rate wideband (AMR-WB) speech
transcoder (TS 26.190 \[2\]), voice activity detection (TS 26.194
\[5\]), comfort noise generation (TS 26.192 \[3\]), and source
controlled rate operation (TS 26.193 \[4\]).

The test sequences may also be used to verify installations of the ANSI
C code in TS 26.173 \[7\].

Clause 5 describes the format of the files which contain the digital
test sequences. Clause 6 describes the test sequences for the speech
transcoder. Clause 7 describes the test sequences for the VAD, comfort
noise and source controlled rate operation.

Clause 8 describes the method by which synchronisation is obtained
between the test sequences and the speech codec under test.

5 Test sequence format
======================

This clause provides information on the format of the digital test
sequences for the adaptive multi-rate wideband (AMR-WB) speech
transcoder (TS 26.190 \[3\]), voice activity detection (TS 26.194
\[5\]), comfort noise generation (TS 26.192 \[3\]), and source
controlled rate operation (TS 26.193 \[4\]).

5.1 File format
---------------

The test sequence files in PC (little-endian) byte order are provided in
archive files (ZIP format) which accompany the present document.

Following decompression, three types of file are provided:

> \- Files for input to the speech encoder: \*.INP
>
> \- Files for comparison with the encoder output and for input to the
> speech decoder: \*.COD
>
> \- Files for comparison with the decoder output: \*.OUT
>
> \- One mode control file for the mode switching test T22.MOD

All file formats are described in TS 26.173 \[7\].

5.2 Codec homing
----------------

Each \*.INP file includes two homing frames (see TS 26.173 \[7\]) at the
start of the test sequence. The function of these frames is to reset the
speech encoder state variables to their initial value. In the case of a
correct installation of the ANSI-C simulation (TS 26.173 \[7\]), all
speech encoder output frames shall be identical to the corresponding
frame in the \*.COD file. In the case of a correct hardware
implementation undergoing testing, the first speech encoder output frame
is undefined and need not be identical to the first frame in the \*.COD
file, but all remaining speech encoder output frames shall be identical
to the corresponding frames in the \*.COD file.

The function of the two homing frames in the \*.COD files is to reset
the speech decoder state variables to their initial value. In the case
of a correct installation of the ANSI-C simulation (TS 26.173 \[7\]),
all speech decoder output frames shall be identical to the corresponding
frame in the \*.OUT file. In the case of a correct hardware
implementation undergoing testing, the first speech decoder output frame
is undefined and need not be identical to first frame in the \*.OUT
file, but all remaining speech decoder output frames shall be identical
to the corresponding frames in the \*.OUT file.

The output using these input sequences will be different depending on
the tested adaptive multi-rate mode. In the notation used below \<mode\>
should be changed to the number of the tested mode, i.e. one of 2385,
2305, 1985, 1825, 1585, 1425, 1265, 885 or 660.

The T00.INP and T01.INP sequences were designed to test the pitch lag of
the adaptive multi-rate wideband speech encoder. In a correct
implementation, the resulting speech encoder output parameters shall be
identical to those specified in the T00\_\<mode\>.COD and
T01\_\<mode\>.COD sequences, respectively.

The T02.INP and T03.INP sequences are particularly suited for testing
the LPC analysis, as well as for finding saturation problems. In a
correct implementation, the resulting speech encoder output parameters
shall be identical to those specified in the T02\_\<mode\>.COD and
T03\_\<mode\>.COD sequences, respectively.

The T04.INP and T05.INP sequences contain a lot of low-frequency
components. In a correct implementation, the resulting speech encoder
output parameters shall be identical to those specified in the
T04\_\<mode\>.COD and T05\_\<mode\>.COD sequences, respectively.

The T18.INP and T21.INP sequences contain \"all zeros\" frames (silence)
in between segments of speech. In a correct implementation, the
resulting speech encoder output parameters shall be identical to those
specified in the T18\_\<mode\>.COD and T21\_\<mode\>.COD sequences,
respectively.

The T20.INP sequence was designed to exercise the LPC code indices and
the ROM table indices of the codec.

The sequences T06.INP to T17.INP and T19.INP were selected on the basis
of bringing various input characteristics (background noise) and levels
to the test sequence set. Homing frame test is also included in T17.INP.
T17.INP has homing frames with length 320 smp, 640 smp and 960 smp
starting from 32000 smp, 16000 smp and 48000 smp in a respective order.
In a correct implementation, the resulting speech encoder output
parameters shall be identical to those specified in the
T06\_\<mode\>.COD to T17\_\<mode\>.COD sequences, respectively.

The T22.INP sequence was designed to test mode switching in the encoder.
For testing mode switching this sequence is used together with the mode
control file T22.MOD. See TS 26.173 \[7\] for the format of the mode
control file. In a correct implementation, the resulting speech encoder
output parameters shall be identical to those specified in the sequence
T22.COD. Note that T22.COD contains parameter frames in different codec
modes.

### 6.2.2 Speech decoder test sequences

Twenty-two times nine speech decoder input sequences TXX\_\<mode\>.COD
(XX = 00..21, \<mode\> = {2385, 2305, 1985, 1825, 1585, 1425, 1265, 885
or 660}) are provided for the static mode tests. These are the output of
the corresponding TXX.INP sequences, one set per mode. In a correct
implementation, the resulting speech decoder output shall be identical
to the corresponding TXX\_\<mode\>.OUT sequences.

The switching test decoder input T22.COD shall result in decoder output
identical to the T22.OUT sequence. For the decoder switching test no
special mode control file is needed since the mode information is
included in the .COD file according to the file format (see TS 26.173
\[7\]).

### 6.2.3 Codec homing sequence

In addition to the test sequences described above, the homing sequences
are provided to assist in codec testing. T23.INP contains one
encoder-homing-frame. The sequences T23\_\<mode\>.COD (\<mode\> = {2385,
2305, 1985, 1825, 1585, 1425, 1265, 885 or 660}) contain one
decoder-homing-frame each for the corresponding mode. The use of these
sequences is described in TS 26.171 \[1\].

All files are contained in the archive T.zip which accompanies the
present document.

7 Test sequences for source controlled rate operation
=====================================================

This clause describes the test sequences designed to exercise the VAD
algorithm (TS 26.194 \[5\]), comfort noise (TS 26.192 \[3\]), and source
controlled rate operation (TS 26.193 \[4\]).

Test sequences DTX1.\*, DT2.\*, DTX4.\* and DTX5.\* shall be run only
with speech codec 23.85 kbit/s. Test sequence DTX3.\* shall be run for
all the speech codec modes.

7.1 Codec configuration
-----------------------

The VAD, comfort noise and source controlled rate operation shall be
tested in conjunction with the speech coder (TS 26.190 \[2\]). The
speech encoder shall be configured to operate in the source controlled
rate mode, with VAD.

7.2 Test Sequences
------------------

Each DTX test sequence consists of three files:

> \- Files for input to the speech encoder: \*.INP
>
> \- Files for comparison with the encoder output and input to the
> speech decoder: \*.COD
>
> \- Files for comparison with the decoder output: \*.OUT

The \*.COD and \*.OUT file names has the format DTXA\_\<mode\>.\*, \"A\"
is the test case number (1, 2, 3, 4 or 5) and \<mode\> is the speech
codec mode.

In a correct implementation, the speech encoder parameters generated by
the \*.INP file shall be identical to those specified in the \*.COD
file; and the speech decoder output generated by the \*.COD file shall
be identical to that specified in the \*.OUT file.

### 7.2.1 Test sequences for background noise estimation

Background noise estimation algorithm is tested by the following test
sequences:

> DTX1.\*
>
> DTX2.\*

### 7.2.2 Test sequences for tone signal detection

Tone signal detection algorithm is tested by the following test
sequence:

> DTX3.\*

### 7.2.3 Real speech and tones

This test sequence consists of very clean speech, barely detectable
speech and a swept frequency tone.

> DTX4.\*

### 7.2.4 Test sequence for signal-to-noise ratio estimation

The full range of SNR estimates are tested by the following test
sequence:

> DTX5.\*

8 Sequences for finding the 20 ms framing of the adaptive multi-rate speech encoder
===================================================================================

When testing the decoder, alignment of the test sequences used to the
decoder framing is achieved by the air interface (testing of MS) or can
be reached easily on the Abis-interface (testing on network side).

When testing the encoder, usually there is no information available
about where the encoder starts its 20 ms segments of speech input to the
encoder.

In the following, a procedure is described to find the 20 ms framing of
the encoder using special synchronisation sequences. This procedure can
be used for MS as well as for network side.

Synchronisation can be achieved in two steps. First, bit synchronisation
has to be found. In a second step, frame synchronisation can be
determined. This procedure takes advantage of the codec homing feature
of the adaptive multi-rate codec, which puts the codec in a defined home
state after the reception of the first homing frame. On the reception of
further homing frames, the output of the codec is predefined and can be
triggered to.

8.1 Bit synchronisation
-----------------------

The input to the speech encoder is a series of 14 bit long words (224
kbit/s, 14 bit linear PCM). When starting to test the speech encoder, no
knowledge is available on bit synchronisation, i.e., where the encoder
expects its least significant bits, and where it expects the most
significant bits.

The encoder homing frame consists of 320 samples, all set to 0x0008 hex.
If two such encoder homing frames are input to the encoder
consecutively, the corresponding decoder homing frame of the used codec
mode is expected at the output as a reaction of the second encoder
homing frame.

Since there are only 14 possibilities for bit synchronisation, after a
maximum of 14 trials bit synchronisation can be reached for each codec
mode. In each trial three consecutive encoder homing frames are input to
the encoder. If the corresponding decoder homing frame is not detected
at the output, the relative bit position of the three input frames is
shifted by one and another trial is performed. As soon as the decoder
homing frame of the used codec mode is detected at the output, bit
synchronisation is found, and the first step can be terminated.

The reason why three consecutive encoder homing frames are needed is
that frame synchronisation is not known at this stage. To be sure that
the encoder reads two complete homing frames, three frames have to be
input. Wherever the encoder has its 20 ms segmentation, it will always
read at least two complete encoder homing frames.

An example of the 14 different frame triplets is given in sequence
BITSYNC.INP.

8.2 Frame synchronisation
-------------------------

Once bit synchronisation is found, frame synchronisation can be found by
inputting two identical frames consecutively to the encoder. There exist
320 different output sequences depending on the 320 different positions
that the beginning of this sequence of frames can possibly have with
respect to the encoder framing.

Before inputting this special synchronisation sequence to the encoder,
again the encoder has to be reset by one encoder homing frame. A second
encoder homing frame is needed to provoke a decoder homing frame at the
output that can be triggered to. And since the framing of the encoder is
not known at that stage, three encoder homing frames have to precede the
special synchronisation sequence to ensure that the encoder reads at
least two homing frames, and at least one decoder homing frame is
produced at the output, serving as a trigger for recording.

After the last decoder homing frame of the used codec mode it is
required to detect two consecutive output frames that are different from
the preceding decoder homing frame.

The special synchronisation sequence preceded by three encoder homing
frames are given in SEQSYNC.INP.

Generally, the output sequences will be different depending on the
tested adaptive multi-rate wideband mode. In the notation below \<mode\>
should be changed to the number of the tested mode, i.e. one of 2385,
2305, 1985, 1825, 1585, 1425, 1265, 885 or 660.

In all 320 output sequences only the second frame after the last decoder
homing frame is given in SYNC000\_\<mode\>.COD through
SYNC319\_\<mode\>.COD. These output frames were calculated by shifting
the sequence SEQSYNC.INP through the positions 0 to 319, where the
samples at the beginning were set to zero. For each codec mode it was
finally verified that the last frame in each of the 320 output sequences
is different to all other last frames.

The three digit number in the filenames above indicates the number of
samples by which the input was retarded with respect to the encoder
framing. By a corresponding shift in the opposite direction, alignment
with the encoder framing for the used codec mode can be reached.

8.3 Formats and sizes of the synchronisation sequences
------------------------------------------------------

BITSYNC.INP:

This sequence consists of 14 frame triplets. It has the format of the
speech encoder input test sequences.

The size of it is therefore:

> SIZE (BITSYNC.INP) = 14 \* 3 \* 320 \* 2 bytes = 26880 bytes

SYNCXXX\_\<mode\>.COD:

These sequences consists of 1 encoder output frame each. They have the
format of the speech encoder output test sequences. In these frames the
values of the TX/RX\_TYPE is fixed to indicate transmit frame type and
FRAME\_TYPE and MODE\_INFO fields are set to the transmit frame type and
to the corresponding encoding mode information \[3\].

The sizes of them are therefore:

> SIZE (SYNCXXX\_2385.COD) = (477 + 3) \* 2 bytes = 960 bytes\
> SIZE (SYNCXXX\_2305.COD) = (461 + 3) \* 2 bytes = 928 bytes\
> SIZE (SYNCXXX\_1985.COD) = (397 + 3) \* 2 bytes = 800 bytes\
> SIZE (SYNCXXX\_1825.COD) = (365 + 3) \* 2 bytes = 736 bytes\
> SIZE (SYNCXXX\_1585.COD) = (317 + 3) \* 2 bytes = 640 bytes\
> SIZE (SYNCXXX\_1425.COD) = (285 + 3) \* 2 bytes = 576 bytes\
> SIZE (SYNCXXX\_1265.COD) = (253 + 3) \* 2 bytes = 512 bytes\
> SIZE (SYNCXXX\_885.COD) = (177 + 3) \* 2 bytes = 360 bytes\
> SIZE (SYNCXXX\_660.COD) = (132 + 3) \* 2 bytes = 270 bytes
