**Summary**

This document provides the recommendation criteria for the default codec
for speech enabled services (SES) as agreed at SQ SWG, SA4\#27.

Updated to remove the 16kHz Mandarin Name dialling task and include
agreed values for recommendations.

Introduction
============

This document defines recommendation criteria for the selection of the
default codec for speech enabled services. These criteria are based on
the design constrains \[1\] and performance evaluations described in the
test and processing plan \[2\]. The recommendation is based on speech
recognition performance and the details of the scoring system are
described below.

**2. Recognition performance**
==============================

2.1 Overview
------------

The set of databases used for the evaluations are defined in the Test
and Processing Plan \[2\]. Each of these databases contains different
types speech material covering a variety of tasks, environments and
languages. Recommendation will be based on a score obtained from the
recognition performance measured on each of these different databases.
Section 2.3 describes how the scores from all the individual databases
are combined using a weighting table (see also appendix 2).

2.2 Scoring on individual databases
-----------------------------------

For each database the reference performance is measured as the word
error rate obtained from the ASR vendor's system. This is the
performance obtained from a state-of-the-art system from the ASR vendor
assuming a transparent channel.

The performance (word error rate) on a given database is also measured
with the ASR vendors system for a codec under test as described in the
test and processing plan.

Scoring for tests performed with channel BLER described in section 3.1.2
of \[2\] will also be computed in a similar way. Note that only BLER of
1% and 3% are considered as part of the recommendation criteria.

**2.3 Performance metric over all databases**

The overall performance will be determined by averaging the absolute
word error rate using the weightings presented in tables A2.1 for 8kHz
sampling rate and A2.2 for 16kHz sampling rate of Appendix 2. The result
of this weighted average is an overall measure of the average word error
rate for each codec. This metric is called the "average word error
rate".

2.4 Comparisons between codecs 
------------------------------

**2.4.1 Low data-rate codec comparison**

The two codecs under consideration at low data-rate are AMR 4.75 and DSR
AFE with extension (5.6kbit/s). Only 8kHz sampling rate is considered
since there is no AMR-WB codec at low data rate.

Table A2.1 in Appendix 2 shows the list of databases that will be tested
and the weightings to be given to the scores obtained for each of these
databases.

**2.4.2 High data-rate codec comparison**

At high data-rates the comparisons are made separately at 8kHz and 16kHz
sampling rates.

**2.4.2.1 8kHz sampling rate**

The two codecs under consideration at high data-rate at 8kHz sampling
are AMR 12.2 & DSR AFE and extension (5.6kbit/s).

Table A2.1 in Appendix 2 shows the list of databases that will be tested
and the weightings to be given to the scores obtained for each of these
databases.

**2.4.2.2 16kHz sampling rate**

The two codecs under consideration at high data-rate at 16kHz sampling
are AMR-WB 12.65, & DSR AFE (5.6kbit/s).

Table A2.2 in Appendix 2 shows the list of databases that will be tested
and the weightings to be given to the scores obtained for each of these
databases.

**3. Recommendation criteria**
==============================

The recommendation procedure will consist of the following:

1.  Candidates not compliant with all Design Constraints will be
    excluded from further consideration. (For the selection meeting, all
    candidates must provide justification document for meeting the
    Design Constraints.)

2.  For the low data-rate comparison:

-   If the relative reduction in average word error rate for the DSR AFE
    codec and its extension compared to the AMR 4.75kbps codec is more
    than 35% then the DSR codec and its extension will be recommended.

-   If the relative reduction in average word error rate for the DSR AFE
    codec and its extension compared to the AMR 4.75kbps codec is less
    than 20% then the DSR codec will not be recommended.

-   If the relative reduction in average word error rate for the DSR AFE
    codec and its extension compared to the AMR 4.75kbps codec is less
    than 20% then AMR will be recommended.

-   If the relative reduction in average word error rate for the DSR AFE
    codec and its extension compared to the AMR 4.75kbps codec is
    between 20% and 35% then the performance results will be further
    considered by SA4 and if there is no consensus the results will be
    passed to SA for decision on what recommendation to make.

3.  For the high data-rate comparison at 8kHz:

-   If the relative reduction in average word error rate for the DSR AFE
    codec and its extension compared to the AMR 12.2kbps codec is more
    than 30% then the DSR codec and its extension will be recommended.

-   If the relative reduction in average word error rate for the DSR AFE
    codec and its extension compared to the AMR 12.2kbps codec is less
    than 20% then the DSR codec will not be recommended.

-   If the relative reduction in average word error rate for the DSR AFE
    codec and its extension compared to the AMR 12.2kbps codec is less
    than 20% then AMR will be recommended.

-   If the relative reduction in average word error rate for the DSR AFE
    codec and its extension compared to the AMR 12.2kbps codec is
    between 20% and 30% then the performance results will be further
    considered by SA4 and if there is no consensus the results will be
    passed to SA for decision on what recommendation to make.

4.  For the high data-rate comparison at 16kHz:

-   If the relative reduction in average word error rate for the DSR AFE
    codec and its extension compared to the AMR-WB codec is more than
    25% then the DSR codec and its extension will be recommended.

-   If the relative reduction in average word error rate for the DSR AFE
    codec and its extension compared to the AMR-WB codec is less than
    15% then the DSR codec will not be recommended.

-   If the relative reduction in average word error rate for the DSR AFE
    codec and its extension compared to the AMR-WB codec is less than
    15% then AMR-WB will be recommended.

-   If the relative reduction in average word error rate for the DSR AFE
    codec and its extension compared to the AMR-WB codec is between 15%
    and 25% then the performance results will be further considered by
    SA4 and if there is no consensus the results will be passed to SA
    for decision on what recommendation to make.

**Appendix 1: Weighting scheme for results on each database**

Each database in the test and processing plan \[2\] produces a set of
results for different training conditions and test sets. The weighting
scheme to be used to combine the different results to give a single
average performance on each database is defined below

1. 3GPP supplied databases
==========================

**1.1 Aurora 2**

  ---------------------------- ---------- ------- -------
  **Database**                 Aurora 2           
  **Test Set**                 Set A      Set B   Set C
  **Weight of the test set**   40 %       40 %    20 %
  ---------------------------- ---------- ------- -------

Table A1: Weighting scheme within the databases Aurora 2

Multicondition and clean trained results to be weighted equally.

**2.2 Aurora 3**

For the Aurora 3 databases there are three test sets, well matched,
medium mismatch and high mismatch. These will be weighted equally.

**2. ASR vendor supplied databases**

Test sets within the ASR vendor supplied databases will be weighted
equally.
