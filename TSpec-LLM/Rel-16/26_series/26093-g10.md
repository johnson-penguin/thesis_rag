4 General
=========

Source Controlled Rate operation (SCR) is a mechanism for the AMR Speech
Codec, which allows to encode the input signal at a lower average rate
by taking speech inactivity into account. The SCR scheme may be used for
the following purposes:

\- to save power in the User Equipment;

\- to reduce the overall interference and load in the networks.

SCR in the transmitting path (uplink) shall be in operation in UEs, if
commanded so by the network. Note that for UMTS AMR and UMTS AMR2 codec
types, the uplink SCR operation shall always be activated. The UE shall
handle SCR in the receiving path (downlink) at any time, regardless,
whether SCR in the transmitting path is enabled or not.

4.1 General organisation
------------------------

The default SCR mechanism described in this document requires the
following functions:

\- a Voice Activity Detector (VAD) on the transmit (TX) side;

\- evaluation of the background acoustic noise on the transmit (TX)
side, in order to transmit characteristic parameters to the receive (RX)
side;

\- generation on the receive (RX) side of a similar noise, called
comfort noise, during periods where the transmission is switched off.

The Voice Activity Detector (VAD) is defined in \[7\] and the AMR-mode
comfort noise functions in \[6\]. Both are based partly on the speech
Codec and its internal variables, defined in \[4\].

In addition to these functions, if the parameters arriving at the RX
side are detected to be seriously corrupted by errors, the speech or
comfort noise must be generated from substituted data in order to avoid
seriously annoying effects for the listener. These functions are defined
in \[5\].

An overall description of the speech processing parts can be found in
\[1\]. An overview of one link SCR operation is shown in Figure 1.

### 5.1.1 General operation

The TX SCR handler passes traffic frames, individually marked by
TX\_TYPE, to the Framing unit. Each frame consists of bit fields
containing the information bits, the codec mode indication, and the
TX\_TYPE. TX\_TYPE shall be used to specify the contents of the frame.
The table below provides an overview of the different TX\_TYPEs used and
explains the required contents in the information bit and the mode
indication bit fields.

Table 1: SCR TX\_TYPE identifiers for UMTS\_AMR and UMTS\_AMR2

  -------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **TX\_TYPE**   **Information Bits**                                                                              **Mode Indication**
  SPEECH\_GOOD   Speech frame, size 95..244 bits, depending on codec mode                                          Current codec mode
  SPEECH\_BAD    Corrupt speech frame (bad CRC), size 95..244 bits, depending on codec mode                        Current codec mode
  SID\_FIRST     Marker for the end of talkspurt, no further information, all 35 comfort noise bits set to \"0\"   The codec mode that would have been used if TX\_TYPE had been \"SPEECH\_GOOD\"
  SID\_UPDATE    35 comfort noise bits                                                                             The codec mode that would have been used if TX\_TYPE had been \"SPEECH\_GOOD\"
  SID\_BAD       Corrupt SID update frame (bad CRC)                                                                The codec mode that would have been used if TX\_TYPE had been \"SPEECH\_GOOD\"
  NO\_DATA       No useful information, nothing to be transmitted                                                  No useful information
  -------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TX\_TYPE = \"NO\_DATA\" indicates that the Information Bit and Codec
Mode fields do not contain any useful data (and should not be
transmitted over AN). The purpose of this TX\_TYPE is to provide the
option to save network transmission between the transcoder and AN. Note,
the TX\_TYPEs \"SPEECH\_BAD\" and \"SID\_BAD\" may occur in TFO and TrFO
situations.

The scheduling of the frames for transmission on the Access Network is
controlled by the TX SCR handler by the use of the TX\_TYPE field.

### 5.1.2 Functions of the TX SCR handler

If TX SCR operation is disabled, the TX SCR handler continuously
generates speech frames, i.e. frames marked with
TX\_TYPE=\"SPEECH\_GOOD\".

If the TX SCR operation is enabled, the VAD flag controls the TX SCR
handler operation as described in the following paragraphs.

Note that the TX SCR operation is always enabled on the UE side for UMTS
AMR and UMTS AMR2 codec types.

#### 5.1.2.1 AMR SCR Timing procedures

To allow an exact verification of the TX SCR handler functions, all
frames before the reset of the system are treated as if there were
speech frames of an infinitely long time. Therefore, and in order to
ensure the correct estimation of comfort noise parameters at RX SCR
side, the first 7 frames after the reset or after enabling the SCR
operation shall always be marked with TX\_TYPE= \"SPEECH\_GOOD\", even
if VAD flag =\"0\" (hangover period, see figure 3).

The Voice Activity Detector (VAD) shall operate all the time in order to
assess whether the input signal contains speech or not. The output is a
binary flag (VAD flag =\"1\" or VAD flag =\"0\", respectively) on a
frame by frame basis (see \[7\]).

The VAD flag controls indirectly, via the TX SCR handler operations
described below, the overall SCR operation on the transmit side.

Whenever VAD flag =\"1\", the speech encoder output frame along with
mode information shall be passed directly to the AN, marked with
TX\_TYPE =\" SPEECH\_GOOD \"

At the end of a speech burst (transition VAD flag =\"1\" to VAD flag
=\"0\"), it takes eight consecutive frames to make a new updated SID
analysis available (see \[6\]). Normally, the first seven  speech
encoder output frames after the end of the speech burst shall therefore
be passed directly to the AN, marked with TX\_TYPE =\" SPEECH\_GOOD \"
(\"hangover period\").

The end of the speech is then indicated by passing frame eight after the
end of the speech burst to the AN, marked with TX\_TYPE = \"SID\_FIRST\"
(see figure 3). SID\_FIRST frames do not contain data.

![](media/image5.wmf){width="6.325in" height="3.1597222222222223in"}

Figure 3: Normal hangover procedure for AMR (Nelapsed \> 23)

If, however, at the end of the speech burst, less than 24 frames have
elapsed since the last SID\_UPDATE frame was computed, then this last
analysed SID\_UPDATE frame should be passed to the AN whenever a
SID\_UPDATE frame is to be produced, until a new updated SID analysis is
available (8 consecutive frames marked with VAD flag =\"0\").This
reduces the load on the network in cases where short background noise
spikes are taken for speech, by avoiding the \"hangover\" waiting for
the SID frame computation.

Once the SID\_FIRST frame has been passed to the AN, the TX SCR handler
shall at regular intervals compute and pass updated SID\_UPDATE (Comfort
Noise) frames to the AN as long as VAD flag = \"0\". SID\_UPDATE frames
shall be generated every 8^th^ frame. The first SID\_UPDATE shall be
sent as the third frame after the SID\_FIRST frame.

The speech encoder is operated in full speech modality if TX\_TYPE = \"
SPEECH\_GOOD \" and otherwise in a simplified mode, because not all
encoder functions are required for the evaluation of comfort noise
parameters and because comfort noise parameters are only to be generated
at certain times.

### 5.1.3 The TX part of the AN

The TX part of the AN has the following overall functionality. The
transmission is cut after the transmission of a SID\_FIRST frame when
the speaker stops talking. During speech pauses the transmission is
resumed at regular intervals for transmission of one SID\_UPDATE frame,
in order to update the generated comfort noise on the RX side. The
operation of

the TX part of the AN is controlled by the TX SCR handler via the
TX\_TYPE.

All frames, marked with SPEECH\_GOOD, SID\_FIRST or SID\_UPDATE shall be
transmitted by the TX part of the AN.

5.2 Receive (RX) side
---------------------

A block diagram of the receive side SCR functions is shown in Figure 4
below.

![](media/image6.wmf){width="5.625in" height="2.1041666666666665in"}

Figure 4: Block diagram of the receive side SCR functions

### 5.2.1 General operation

The AN passes all the received traffic frames to the RX SCR handler,
classified with RX\_TYPE, as described in Table 2 (see TS 26.102). The
RX SCR handles the frame accordingly.

Table 2: RX\_TYPE identifiers for UMTS\_AMR and UMTS\_AMR2

  ------------------ --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **RX\_TYPE**       **Information Bits**
  **SPEECH\_GOOD**   Speech frame without detected errors.
  **SPEECH\_BAD**    (likely) speech frame with bad CRC (or estimated to be very bad by the RX part of the AN )
  **SID\_FIRST**     This SID-frame marks the beginning of a comfort noise period.
  **SID\_UPDATE**    Correct SID update frame
  **SID\_BAD**       Corrupt SID update frame (bad CRC; applicable only for SID\_UPDATE frames)
  **NO\_DATA**       Nothing useable was received. The synthesis mode of the previous frame type is used.
  ------------------ --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 5.2.3 Demands on the RX SCR handler

The RX SCR handler is responsible for the overall SCR operation on the
RX side. It consists of two main modes: SPEECH and COMFORT\_NOISE. The
initial mode shall be SPEECH.

The SCR operation on the RX side shall be as follows:

\- The RX SCR handler shall enter mode SPEECH, when a frame classified
as SPEECH\_GOOD is received.

\- whenever a frame classified as SPEECH\_GOOD is received the RX SCR
handler shall pass it directly on to the speech decoder;

\- if the RX SCR handler is in mode SPEECH, then frames classified as
SPEECH\_BAD or NO\_DATA shall be substituted and muted as defined in
\[5\]. Frames classified as NO\_DATA shall be handled like SPEECH\_BAD
frames without valid speech information;

\- frames classified as SID\_FIRST, SID\_UPDATE or SID\_BAD shall bring
the RX SCR handler into mode COMFORT\_NOISE and shall result in comfort
noise generation, as defined in \[6\]. SID\_BAD frames shall be
substituted and muted as defined in \[5\];;

\- in mode COMFORT\_NOISE the RX SCR handler shall ignore all unusable
frames (NO\_DATA, SPEECH\_BAD); comfort noise generation shall continue,
until timeout may apply (\[5\]).

5.3 AMR SID Information format
------------------------------

The SID\_UPDATE frame format is according to \[5\]. This is the default
and only mandatory operating mode of the SCR handler.

######## Annex A (normative): AMR DTX handler for the GSM system (corresponding to GSM 06.93)

A.1 Scope
=========

The present document gives a description of the general baseband
operation of Adaptive Multi-Rate speech traffic channels in the
transmitter and in the receiver of GSM Mobile Stations (MS)s and Base
Station Systems (BSS)s during Discontinuous Transmission (DTX).

For clarity, the description is structured according to the block
diagrams in figures 1 and 3. Except in the case described next, this
structure of distributing the various functions between system entities
is not mandatory for implementation, as long as the operation on the air
interface and on the speech decoder output remains the same.

In the case of BSSs where the speech transcoder is located remote from
the Base Transceiver Station (BTS), the implementation of the interfaces
between the DTX handlers and the Radio Sub System (RSS) as described in
the present document together with all their flags is mandatory, being
part of the A‑bis interface as described in GSM 08.60 and GSM 08.61.

The DTX functions described in this technical specification are
mandatory for implementation in the GSM MSs. The receiver requirements
are mandatory for implementation in all GSM BSSs, the transmitter
requirements only for those where downlink DTX or Tandem Free Operation
will be used.

A.4 General
===========

Discontinuous Transmission (DTX) is a mechanism, which allows the radio
transmitter to be switched off most of the time during speech pauses for
the following two purposes:

to save power in the Mobile Station (MS);

to reduce the overall interference level over the air interface.

DTX in uplink shall be in operation within the GSM MS, if commanded so
by the network, see 3GPP TS 204.08. The MS shall handle DTX in downlink
at any time, regardless, whether DTX in uplink is commanded or not.

A.4.1 General organisation
--------------------------

The overall DTX mechanism described in the present document requires the
following functions:

a Voice Activity Detector (VAD) on the transmit (TX) side;

evaluation of the background acoustic noise on the transmit (TX) side,
in order to transmit characteristic parameters to the receive (RX) side;

generation on the receive (RX) side of a similar noise, called comfort
noise, during periods where the radio transmission is switched off.

The Voice Activity Detector (VAD) is defined in 3GPP TS 26.094 and the
comfort noise functions in 3GPP TS 26.092. Both are based partly on the
speech transcoder and its internal variables, defined in 3GPP TS 26.090.

In addition to these functions, if the parameters arriving at the RX
side are detected to be seriously corrupted by errors, the speech or
comfort noise must be generated from substituted data in order to avoid
seriously annoying effects for the listener. This function is defined in
3GPP TS 26.091.

An overall description of the speech processing parts can be found in
3GPP TS 26.071.

The description for Tandem Free Operation is given in 3GPP TS 28.062.

A.5.1 General operation
-----------------------

The TX DTX handler passes traffic frames, individually marked by
TX\_TYPE, to the Radio Subsystem (RSS). Each frame passed to the RSS
consists of bit fields containing the information bits, the codec mode
indication, and the TX\_TYPE. TX\_TYPE is used to specify the contents
of the frame. The table below provides an overview of the different
TX\_TYPEs used and explains the required contents in the information bit
and the mode indication bit fields. In case of ongoing Tandem Free
Operation (see 3GPP TS 28.062) frames with errors may arrive in downlink
in the BTS.

  --------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------

TX\_TYPE = \"NO\_DATA\" indicates that the Information Bit and Codec
Mode fields do not contain any useful data (and shall not be transmitted
over the air interface). The purpose of this TX\_TYPE is to provide the
option to save transmission between the transcoder and the radio base
station if a packet oriented transmission is used.

The scheduling of the frames for transmission on the air interface is
controlled by the TX DTX handler by the use of the TX\_TYPE field.

### A.5.1.1 Functions of the TX DTX handler

To allow an exact verification of the TX DTX handler functions, all
frames before the reset of the system are treated as if there were
speech frames of an infinitely long time. Therefore, and in order to
ensure the correct estimation of comfort noise parameters at RX DTX
side, the first 7 frames after the reset or after enabling the DTX
operation shall always be marked with TX\_TYPE= \" SPEECH\_GOOD \", even
if VAD flag =\"0\" (hangover period, see figure 2).

The Voice Activity Detector (VAD) shall operate all the time in order to
assess whether the input signal contains speech or not. The output is a
binary flag (VAD flag =\"1\" or VAD flag =\"0\", respectively) on a
frame by frame basis (see 3GPP TS 26.094).

The VAD flag controls indirectly, via the TX DTX handler operations
described below, the overall DTX operation on the transmit side.

Whenever VAD flag =\"1\", the speech encoder output frame along with
mode information shall be passed directly to the radio subsystem (RSS),
marked with TX\_TYPE =\" SPEECH\_GOOD \"

At the end of a speech burst (transition VAD flag =\"1\" to VAD flag
=\"0\"), it takes 8 consecutive frames to make a new updated SID
analysis available at receiver side (see 3GPP TS 26.092). Normally, the
first 7 speech encoder output frames after the end of the speech burst
shall therefore be passed directly to the RSS, marked with TX\_TYPE =\"
SPEECH\_GOOD \" (\"hangover period\"). The end of the speech is then
indicated by passing frame 8 after the end of the speech burst to the
RSS, marked with TX\_TYPE = \"SID\_FIRST\" (see figure 2).

![](media/image8.wmf){width="6.325in" height="3.1597222222222223in"}

Figure 6: Normal hangover procedure (Nelapsed \> 23)

If, however, at the end of the speech burst, less than 24 frames have
elapsed since the last SID\_UPDATE frame was computed and passed to the
RSS, then this last analysed SID\_UPDATE frame shall repeatedly be
passed to the RSS whenever a SID\_UPDATE frame is to be produced, until
a new updated SID analysis is available (8 consecutive frames marked
with VAD flag =\"0\").This reduces the activity on the air in cases
where short background noise spikes are taken for speech, by avoiding
the \"hangover\" waiting for the SID frame computation.

Once the first SID analysis after the end of a speech burst has been
computed and the SID\_FIRST frame has been passed to the Radio
Subsystem, the TX DTX handler shall at regular intervals compute and
pass updated SID\_UPDATE (Comfort Noise) frames to the Radio Subsystem
(RSS) as long as VAD flag = \"0\". SID\_UPDATE frames shall be generated
every 8^th^ frame. The first SID\_UPDATE shall be sent as the third
frame after the SID\_FIRST frame.

The speech encoder is operated in full speech modality if TX\_TYPE = \"
SPEECH\_GOOD \" and otherwise in a simplified mode, because not all
encoder functions are required for the evaluation of comfort noise
parameters and because comfort noise parameters are only to be generated
at certain times.

In order to ensure TX/RX DTX handler synchronisation at handover, the
uplink TX DTX handler in the MS shall accept messages from TX RSS with
control parameter NSYNC, resulting in the following operation during a
period of the next NSYNC frames:

\- The TX DTX handler shall send SID\_UPDATE instead of NO\_DATA frames
to the TX RSS.

\- If, however, during this period of NSYNC frames, VAD flag is equal to
1 at least for one speech frame, TX DTX handler shall send SPEECH frames
for the rest of the period of the NSYNC frames. Note the TX DTX handler
shall send SPEECH frames at least for the duration of the hangover
period.

### A.5.1.2 Functions of the TX Radio Subsystem

The TX Radio Subsystem has the following overall functionality. The
radio transmission is cut after the transmission of a SID\_FIRST frame
when the speaker stops talking. During speech pauses the transmission is
resumed at regular intervals for transmission of one SID\_UPDATE frame,
in order to update the generated comfort noise on the RX side (and to
improve the measurement of the link quality by the RSS). Note that the
transcoder knows what frames to send. In the case when nothing is to be
transmitted it outputs frames marked with TX\_TYPE = \"NO\_DATA\".

Within the TX Radio Subsystem the TX\_TYPE Monitoring unit controls the
operation of the Channel Encoder (as specified in 3GPP TS 25.003) and
the Transmission of the frame. Control input to the TX\_TYPE Monitoring
unit is the TX\_TYPE. Control output and input to the Channel Encoder
are indicators specifying the frame format. These frame format
indicators are defined in 3GPP TS 25.003, they are different for TCH/AFS
and TCH/AHS.

#### A.5.1.2.1 Functions of the TX Radio Subsystem for TCH/AFS

The TX Radio Subsystem operates in the following way regarding DTX
(without TFO):

\- all frames marked with TX\_TYPE = \" SPEECH\_GOOD \" are scheduled
for normal channel coding and transmission. The frame format for CHE
operation shall be SPEECH. If, however, the previous frame was not of
TX\_TYPE = \"SPEECH\_GOOD\", an ONSET frame format followed by
SPEECH\_GOOD shall be signalled to the CHE;

\- for frames marked with TX\_TYPE = \"SID\_FIRST\" a SID\_FIRST frame
format is signalled to the CHE;

\- frames marked with TX\_TYPE = \"SID\_UPDATE\" are scheduled for
SID\_UPDATE frame channel coding and transmission. The frame format
signalled to CHE is SID\_UPDATE;

\- for frames marked with TX\_TYPE = \"NO\_DATA\" no processing or
transmission is carried out.

If a FACCH needs to be sent during a speech pause, and:

\- if the frame preceding the FACCH is not of TX\_TYPE=\"SPEECH\_GOOD\",
then an ONSET frame shall be signalled to the CHE, followed by the FACCH
frame(s);

\- if the frame following the FACCH frame is not of
TX\_TYPE=\"SPEECH\_GOOD\", then a SID\_FIRST shall be signalled to the
CHE.

A stolen SID\_UPDATE should be rescheduled on the frame subsequent to
the SID\_FIRST marker that follows the FACCH frame(s) (when that marker
exists), unless that rescheduling would steal a frame of
TX\_TYPE=\"SPEECH\_GOOD\", or if a frame of TX\_TYPE=\"SID\_UPDATE\" has
been received before the rescheduling could take place. This
rescheduling shall not affect the timing of subsequent SID\_UPDATE
frames.

Note: a SID\_UPDATE frame is considered as stolen when this frame must
be replaced by a FACCH frame.

At handover, TX/RX DTX handler synchronisation shall be initiated. At
the time instant before the MS starts sending to the new base station, a
message shall be sent to the uplink TX DTX handler with the parameter
NSYNC = 12.

#### A.5.1.2.2 Functions of the TX Radio Subsystem for TCH/AHS

The TX Radio Subsystem operates in the following way regarding DTX:

all frames marked with TX\_TYPE = \" SPEECH\_GOOD \" are scheduled for
normal channel coding and transmission. The frame format for CHE
operation shall be SPEECH. However, if the previous frame was of
TX\_TYPE = \"SID\_FIRST\", a SID\_FIRST\_INH frame format followed by
SPEECH\_GOOD shall be signalled to the CHE. If the previous frame was of
TX\_TYPE = \"SID\_UPDATE\", a SID\_UPDATE\_INH frame format followed by
SPEECH\_GOOD shall be signalled to the CHE. If the previous frame was of
TX\_TYPE \"NO\_DATA\", an ONSET frame format followed by SPEECH\_GOOD
shall be signalled to the CHE;

for frames marked with TX\_TYPE = \"SID\_FIRST\" a SID\_FIRST\_P1 frame
format is signalled to the CHE. Note: All 4 TDMA frames carrying the
bits of this frame shall be transmitted. The Mode Indication received
with the frame is stored for potential use in the next frame;

for frames marked with TX\_TYPE = \"SID\_UPDATE\" a SID\_UPDATE frame
format is signalled to the CHE. All 4 TDMA frames carrying the bits of
this frame shall be transmitted;

for frames marked with TX\_TYPE = \"NO\_DATA\", no processing or
transmission is carried out. However, if the preceding frame was marked
with TX\_TYPE = \"SID\_FIRST\", a SID\_FIRST\_P2 frame format is
signalled to CHE. Note: The 2 TDMA frames carrying bits of this frame
shall be transmitted. If, depending on the current frame number, the
Mode Indication is to be transmitted with these TDMA frames, the Mode
Indication shall be used that was stored during the processing of the
preceding SID\_FIRST frame.

If a FACCH needs to be sent during a speech pause, and:

> if the frame preceding the FACCH is of TX\_TYPE=\"SID\_FIRST\", then a
> SID\_FIRST\_INH frame format followed by the FACCH shall be signalled
> to the CHE;
>
> if the frame preceding the FACCH [ ]{.underline} is of
> TX\_TYPE=\"SID\_UPDATE\", then a SID\_UPDATE\_INH frame format
> followed by the FACCH shall be signalled to the CHE;
>
> if the frame preceding the FACCH [ ]{.underline} is of
> TX\_TYPE=\"NO\_DATA\", then an ONSET frame format followed by the
> FACCH shall be signalled to the CHE;

if the frame following the FACCH [ ]{.underline} is not of
TX\_TYPE=\"SPEECH\_GOOD\", then a SID\_FIRST shall be signalled to the
CHE. Both SID\_FIRST\_P1 and SID\_FIRST\_P2 frame formats shall be
consecutively signalled to CHE.

A stolen SID\_UPDATE should be rescheduled on the frame subsequent to
the SID\_FIRST\_P1 and SID\_FIRST\_P2 markers that follow the FACCH
frame(s) (when these markers exist), unless that rescheduling would
steal a frame of TX\_TYPE=\"SPEECH\_GOOD\", or if a frame of
TX\_TYPE=\"SID\_UPDATE\" has been received before the rescheduling could
take place. This rescheduling shall not affect the timing of subsequent
SID\_UPDATE frames.

Note: a SID\_UPDATE frame is considered as stolen when this frame must
be replaced by a FACCH frame.

At handover, TX/RX DTX handler synchronisation shall be initiated. At
the time instant before the MS starts sending to the new base station, a
message shall be sent to the uplink TX DTX handler with the parameter
NSYNC = 12.

#### A.5.1.2.3 Functions of the Downlink TX Radio Subsystem for TFO

The TX Radio Subsystem in the BTS shall in addition operate in the
following way regarding DTX, if TFO is ongoing (see 3GPP TS 28.062):

\- Frames with TX\_TYPE = SPEECH\_GOOD, SID\_FIRST and SID\_UPDATE shall
be handled as usual in DTX, regardless whether DTX in downlink is
requested or not. Also NO\_DATA shall be handled as usual, if DTX is
requested.

\- Frames with TX\_TYPE = NO\_DATA shall be replaced by SID\_FILLER
frames, if DTX in downlink is not requested. By this the radio
transmission continues in downlink, although no parameters are
transmitted in speech pauses on the Abis interface. The MS generates
Comfort Noise in these speech pauses.

\- Frames with TX\_TYPE = SPEECH\_DEGRADED shall be handled exactly like
SPEECH\_GOOD frames.

\- For frame with TX\_TYPE = SPEECH\_BAD and SID\_BAD the CHE shall
perform its regular processing, but then shall invert the six,
respectively 14 CRC bits before convolutional encoding and transmitting
the frames on the air interface. By this the error concealment mechanism
in the MS is triggered to handle these corrupted frames.

\- ONSET frames may be ignored by the TX Radio Subsystem and need not to
be processed.

**Definition:** SID\_FILLER frames are like SID\_BAD frames, but with
all information bits set to \"1\". The 14 CRC bits shall artificially be
inverted by the CHE before convolutional encoding and transmission.

#### A.5.1.2.4 Functions of the TX Radio Subsystem for RATSCCH

During regular speech transmission (in the middle of a speech burst)
RATSCCH replaces (steals) one (TCH/AFS) respectively two (TCH/AHS)
speech frames (see 3GPP TS 25.009). Also in all non speech cases the
RATSCCH shall be handled like speech. The respective RATSCCH frame
formats (RATSCCH in case of TCH/AFS, respectively RATSCCH\_MARKER and
RATSCCH\_DATA in case of TCH/AHS) shall be signalled to the CHE.

RATSCCH should be handled in the same way as a FACCH.

A.6 Receive (RX) side
=====================

A block diagram of the receive side DTX functions is shown in figure 7.

Figure 7: Block diagram of the receive side DTX functions

A.6.1 General operation
-----------------------

Whatever their context (speech, SID, FACCH or none), the RSS
continuously passes the received traffic frames to the RX DTX handler,
individually marked by various pre‑processing functions with RX\_TYPE as
described in subclause 6.1.1 and table 2, which serves to classify the
traffic frame. This classification allows the RX DTX handler to
determine in a simple way how the received frame is to be handled.

Table 4: RX\_TYPE identifiers

  ---------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  RX\_TYPE Legend        Description
  **SPEECH\_GOOD**       Speech frame with CRC OK, Channel Decoder soft values also OK
  **SPEECH\_DEGRADED**   Speech frame with CRC OK, but 1B bits and class2 bits may be corrupted
  **SPEECH\_BAD**        (likely) speech frame, bad CRC (or very bad Channel Decoder measures)
  **SID\_FIRST**         first SID marks the beginning of a comfort noise period
  **SID\_UPDATE**        SID update frame (with correct CRC)
  **SID\_BAD**           Corrupt SID update frame (bad CRC; applicable only for SID\_UPDATE frames)
  **ONSET**              ONSET frames precede the first speech frame of a speech burst
  **NO\_DATA**           Nothing useable (for the speech decoder) was received. This applies for the cases of no received frames (DTX) or received FACCH or RATSCCH or SID\_FILLER signalling frames.
  ---------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### A.6.1.1 Functions of the RX radio subsystem

The RX radio subsystem uses a combination of gross-bit markers, receiver
measurements, and CRC checks to classify each received frame. The basic
operation for each frame is outlined below:

\- the receiver first searches for the RATSCCH, SID\_UPDATE, SID\_FIRST
or ONSET gross bit markers.

\- If the RATSCCH signalling is detected, then the RATSCCH frame
(TCH/AFS) respectively the RATSCCH\_MARKER and RATSCCH\_DATA frames
(TCH/AHS) shall be decoded and handled as described in 3GPP TS 25.009.
They shall be passed to the RX DTX handler as a NO\_DATA frame(s).

\- If the SID\_FIRST marker is detected the frame is passed to the RX
DTX handler as a SID\_FIRST frame.

\- If the SID\_UPDATE marker is detected, then the frame shall be
decoded and passed to the RX DTX handler as a SID\_UPDATE or a SID\_BAD
or a NO\_DATA frame, depending on the CRC and the information bits,
along with the comfort noise parameters, if applicable. A NO\_DATA frame
shall be passed on, if all information bits of a SID\_UPDATE frame are
set to \"1\" and the CRC is bad (see SID\_FILLER in subclause 5.1.2.3).

\- If the ONSET marker is detected, then an ONSET frame shall be passed
to the RX DTX handler.

\- if neither SID\_UPDATE nor SID\_FIRST markers are detected, the frame
shall be channel decoded assuming it to be a speech frame. Depending on
the CRC for speech frame channel decoding along with other receiver
measurements the frame shall then be passed to the RX DTX handler marked
as either SPEECH\_GOOD, SPEECH\_ DEGRADED, SPEECH\_BAD or NO\_DATA
frame.

### A.6.1.2 Functions of the RX DTX handler

The RX DTX handler is responsible for the overall DTX operation on the
RX side. It consists of two main modes: SPEECH and COMFORT\_NOISE. The
initial mode shall be SPEECH.

The DTX operation on the RX side shall be as follows:

\- The RX DTX handler shall enter mode SPEECH, when a frame classified
as SPEECH\_GOOD or SPEECH\_DEGRADED is received. ONSET frames may be
taken into account to identify the beginning of a speech burst;

\- whenever a frame classified as SPEECH\_GOOD is received the RX DTX
handler shall pass it directly on to the speech decoder;

\- if the RX DTX handler is in mode SPEECH, then frames classified as
SPEECH\_DEGRADED, SPEECH\_BAD or NO\_DATA shall be substituted and muted
as defined in 3GPP TS 26.091. Frames classified as NO\_DATA shall be
handled like SPEECH\_BAD frames without valid speech information;

frames classified as SID\_FIRST, SID\_UPDATE or SID\_BAD shall bring the
RX DTX handler into mode COMFORT\_NOISE and shall result in comfort
noise generation, as defined in 3GPP TS 26.092. SID\_BAD frames shall be
substituted and muted as defined in 3GPP TS 26.091. In mode
COMFORT\_NOISE the RX DTX handler shall ignore all unusable frames
(NO\_DATA, SPEECH\_BAD) delivered by the RSS; comfort noise generation
shall continue, until timeout may apply (see 3GPP TS 26.091).

######## Annex B (normative): ETSI GSM-EFR SCR handler

The interworking operation of AMR (only 12.2 kbit/s mode) with GSM-EFR
is F.F.S. This annex provides the basis for the AMR operation under this
condition.

B.1 Transmit (TX) side
======================

Speech coding internetworking aspects with ETSI-EFR are described in
\[TBD\].

B.1.1 General operation
-----------------------

The TX SCR handler passes traffic frames, individually marked by
TX\_TYPE, to the TX Framing Unit part of the Access Network. Each frame
passed to the AN consists of bit fields containing the information bits,
the codec mode indication, and the TX\_TYPE. TX\_TYPE shall be used to
specify the contents of the frame. The table below provides an overview
of the different TX\_TYPEs used and explains the required contents in
the information bit and the mode indication bit fields.

Table 5: TX TYPE identifiers for GSM-EFR

  -------------- ------------- ---------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **TX\_TYPE**   **Legend**    **Information Bits**                           **Mode Indication**
  00             SPEECH        speech frame, size depending on codec mode     current codec mode
  10             SID\_UPDATE   comfort noise information , information bits   the codec mode that would have been used if TX\_TYPE had been 00 (SPEECH)
  11             NO\_DATA      no useful information                          no useful information
  -------------- ------------- ---------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

TX\_TYPE = \"NO\_DATA\" indicates that the Information Bit and Codec
Mode fields do not contain any useful data (and should not be
transmitted over AN). The purpose of this TX\_TYPE is to provide the
option to save network transmission between the transcoder and AN.

The scheduling of the frames for transmission on the Access Network is
controlled by the TX SCR handler by the use of the TX\_TYPE field and
the given SCR operation mode.

B.1.2 Functions of the TX SCR handler
-------------------------------------

### B.1.2.1 GSM-EFR SCR Timing procedures

To allow an exact verification of the TX SCR handler functions, all
frames before the reset of the system are treated as if there were
speech frames of an infinitely long time.

The SID\_UPDATE timing is according to ETSI GSM 06.81.

B.1.3 The TX part of the AN
---------------------------

### B.1.3.1 Demands on the TX part of the Access Network

The TX part of the AN operates in the following way regarding SCR:

\- frames marked with TX\_TYPE = (SPEECH) are scheduled for
transmission.

\- frames marked with TX\_TYPE = (SID\_UPDATE) are scheduled for
transmission

\- for frames marked with TX\_TYPE = (NO\_DATA) no processing or
transmission is carried out.

SPEECH frames shall override other frames in these exceptional cases.

B.2 Receive (RX) side
=====================

Whatever their context (speech, SID, or none), the deframing unit after
AN continuously passes the received traffic frames to the RX SCR
handler, individually marked by various pre‑processing functions with a
3 bit type indicator RX\_TYPE described in Table 4, which serve to
classify the traffic frame. This classification allows the RX SCR
handler to determine in a simple way how the received frame is to be
handled.

======================

E.1.1 General operation
-----------------------

The TX SCR handler passes traffic frames, individually marked by
TX\_TYPE, to the TX Framing Unit part of the Access Network. Each frame
passed to the AN consists of bit fields containing the information bits,
the codec mode indication, and the TX\_TYPE. TX\_TYPE shall be used to
specify the contents of the frame. The table below provides an overview
of the different TX\_TYPEs used and explains the required contents in
the information bit and the mode indication bit fields.

+--------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+

TX\_TYPE = \"NO\_DATA\" indicates that the Information Bit and Codec
Mode fields do not contain any useful data (and should not be
transmitted over AN). The purpose of this TX\_TYPE is to provide the
option to save network transmission between the transcoder and AN.

The scheduling of the frames for transmission on the Access Network is
controlled by the TX SCR handler by the use of the TX\_TYPE field and
the given SCR operation mode.

Speech coding internetworking aspects with PDC-EFR are described in
XX.YY.D.\[TBD\]

E.1.2 Functions of the TX SCR handler
-------------------------------------

### E.1.2.1 PDC\_EFR SCR Timing procedures

To allow an exact verification of the TX SCR handler functions, all
frames before the reset of the system are treated as if there were
speech frames of an infinitely long time.

SID-frame timing is according to ARIB XXX.

E.1.3 The TX part of the AN
---------------------------

### E.1.3.1 Demands on the TX part of the Access Network

The TX part of the AN operates in the following way regarding SCR:

\- frames marked with TX\_TYPE = (SPEECH) are scheduled for
transmission.

\- frames marked with TX\_TYPE = (POST0) are scheduled for transmission.

\- frames marked with TX\_TYPE = (POST1) are scheduled for transmission

\- frames marked with TX\_TYPE = (PRE) are scheduled for transmission

\- for frames marked with TX\_TYPE = (NO\_DATA) no processing or
transmission is carried out.

SPEECH frames shall override other frames in these exceptional cases.

E.2 Receive (RX) side
=====================

Whatever their context (speech, SID, or none), the deframing unit after
AN continuously passes the received traffic frames to the RX SCR
handler, individually marked by various pre‑processing functions with a
3 bit type indicator RX\_TYPE described in Table 6, which serve to
classify the traffic frame. This classification allows the RX SCR
handler to determine in a simple way how the received frame is to be
handled.
