4.1 Introduction
----------------

This Technical Report studies use cases and solutions for both video
scalability and 3D stereoscopic video and investigates their performance
in a variety of setups using 3GPP\'s streaming and multicast/broadcast
services. Subclause 5.1 introduces use cases on 2D service, and the
codec solutions enabling the use cases are described in subclause 6.1.1.
Subclause 6.1.2 introduces some applications integrating the 2D
solutions and codecs, and the performance of the solutions is evaluated
in subclause 6.1.3. Stereoscopic 3D use cases are introduced in
subclause 5.2. Enabling codecs for the 3D use cases are described in
subclause 6.2.1, and the performance is evaluated in subclause 6.2.2.
This document includes two attachment files which are the config files
used in the evaluations of codecs. Annexes for helping understanding the
simulation conditions are also included. Finally conclusion based on the
study of this TR is presented in subclause 7.

5 Use Cases
===========

5.1 2D Video Use Cases
----------------------

### 5.1.1 Adaptive HTTP Streaming and Caches

This use case considers HTTP-based streaming delivery of video content.
Caching of popular content can significantly decrease the average and
peak load within a 3GPP backbone. Using HTTP streaming, caching can be
performed by standard HTTP caches.

![](media/image5.wmf){width="6.4944444444444445in"
height="1.2673611111111112in"}

Figure 1: System architecture for adaptive HTTP streaming \[2\].

In this use case the media coding, especially the video coding (e.g.
multi-layered SVC compared to multi bitrate versions of H.264/AVC single
layer coding), and its integration into HTTP Streaming framework will be
evaluated with respect to improvement in usage of originating server,
backbone and caches, and in general its impact on the system, including
the impact on encoders and clients. Furthermore the effect of rate
adaptation will be evaluated in such scenarios.

### 5.1.2 UE Power Saving and Fast Stream Switching in MBMS

Efficient power usage is an important criterion in providing MBMS TV
service. When the TV stream is transmitted continuously, UE should
receive data continuously in active mode, as a result, battery power is
consumed. Typical method used for UE power saving is scheduling the
transmission and sleep period that UE may turn-off radio component
during the sleep interval. This requires discontinuous transmission of
MBMS streams. However, a trade-off is that user may experience long
delay when switching between streams, if the sleep interval is increased
Therefore, it should be able to support efficient power usage of UE as
well as fast content switching.

### 5.1.3 Graceful Degradation

#### 5.1.3.1 Rate Adaptation in PSS When Entering Bad Reception Conditions

A mobile TV service may have to cope with varying reception conditions
at the UE to avoid service interruptions. A desired behaviour would be
to apply by rate adaptation of the video stream to the achievable
service bit rate. Since a reduced media rate results in a reduced video
play out quality, such a video stream adaptation should be performed in
a graceful way. Therefore, the service should allow a fine granular rate
adaptation to avoid abrupt quality changes in an efficient way

#### 5.1.3.2 Graceful Degradation in MBMS Services When Entering Bad Reception Conditions

In contrary to a PSS service, an MBMS service cannot adapt to individual
receivers need. That is, users entering difficult reception conditions
may experience sudden service interruption instead of soft degradation
of e.g. video quality. To keep users satisfied when switching from PSS
services to MBMS, a Graceful Degradation of the broadcast service is a
desired feature. Such a feature can be applied to a broadcast service by
allowing differentiation transmission robustness for different parts of
the video stream. The service should allow minimum acceptable quality to
the user perception at the service coverage configured by operator.

#### 5.1.3.3 Graceful Degradation in Traffic Congestion

In a situation where multiple service users converge in a cell,
available bandwidth of the cell depletes quickly. In such case, service
to lately incoming UEs may be refused, or all UEs in the cell may suffer
severe quality degradation. The situation can be improved when bandwidth
of the streams can be reduced with graceful quality degradation using
IVS. The service quality is recovered as congestion state of the cell is
relieved.

#### 5.1.3.4 Combined Support of Heterogeneous Devices and Graceful Degradation

It is expected, that there will be a coexistence of a variety of device
capabilities within 3GPP system and each of these devices may be in
different reception conditions. Therefore to cope with both of these
challenges in an efficient way, a service should be able to support the
heterogeneous devices and to provide Graceful Degradation behaviour at
the same time.

5.2 Stereoscopic 3D Video Use Cases
-----------------------------------

### 5.2.1 Stereoscopic 3D Video Delivery

Stereoscopic 3D video content is becoming increasingly available. A
steadily growing share of professionally produced content is captured in
stereoscopic 3D format. On the other hand, mobile devices with 3D
rendering capabilities will gradually enter the market. Since capturing
clean stereoscopic 3D video is extremely challenging, it is expected
that the main short-term usage of these device capabilities will be for
the consumption of professionally produced stereoscopic 3D content.
Figure 2 depicts an example setup for the distribution of stereoscopic
3D content. While 3D capable devices will enjoy the stereo video, it
should be possible to author so that legacy devices can consume the same
content in 2D.

![](media/image6.jpeg){width="6.207638888888889in"
height="2.917361111111111in"}

Figure 2: Example scenario of distribution of 2D and stereoscopic 3D
video

Services such as PSS and MBMS provide the right channels for
distributing the content to 3D capable mobile devices. The specified
delivery options include multicast, RTP streaming, adaptive HTTP
streaming and progressive download.

This use case may be enabled through different video coding solutions
such as H.264/MVC \[3\] and frame-compatible H.264/AVC (with SEI
signaling). These solutions will be studied and their performances will
be evaluated.

It is in the scope of the study to consider not only coding and
backwards-compatibility, but also the suitability of mobile devices in
general for viewing 3D content (considering issues such as screen size,
viewing distance, and resolution, for example). It is also in scope to
consider whether 3D content from other domains could be re-targeted or
whether the mobile environment might need custom 3D content preparation.
Finally, consideration of whether different mobile devices might need
different content (not just, for example, different encodings or
resolutions), is in scope.

### 5.2.2 External Viewing 3D Experience

#### 5.2.2.1 Introduction

The following use cases are based on the same access conditions as
presented in 5.2.1. They propose the ability to decode a 3D video
content directly on the UE with using an external display to provide the
3D experience.

#### 5.2.2.2 Video Eyewear 3D Experience

This use case describes a 3D experience provided thanks to video glasses
(also called video eyewear headsets) compatible with stereoscopic video.
During the recent years, progress has been achieved on the ability to
use such video glasses in order to simulate large screen viewing
experience. When connected to a mobile terminal receiving a stereoscopic
video the video glasses display the left view on the left eye and the
right view on the right eye. Each eye receiving a different view, the
depth is provided to the user.

Figure 3 illustrates the current use case.

![](media/image7.jpeg){width="4.68125in" height="1.5743055555555556in"}

Figure 3: Use case of 3D content viewed on video glasses

#### 5.2.2.3 Mobile Terminal Connected to a 3DTV Set

This use case can be associated to the mobile 3D concept in the way it
enables 3D experience when receiving a video content over the 3GPP
access network. A user wants to watch a 3D movie on its 3D compatible TV
set at home. He may take advantage of its LTE coverage to get the
streamed video which is decoded in its mobile terminal. The terminal has
a digital connectivity which enables the connection with a 3DTV display
(e.g. via a micro-HDMI/HDMI cable). In this use case the mobile terminal
acts as a mobile Set top box.

Figure 4 hereafter illustrates the current use case.

6 Evaluation of Solutions
=========================

6.1 2D Use Cases
----------------

### 6.1.1 Enabling Codecs and Formats

#### 6.1.1.1 Scalable Video Coding

##### 6.1.1.1.1 Introduction

Scalable Video Coding (SVC) \[3\] has been defined as an extension to
the H.264/AVC \[3\] video coding standard. SVC enhances H.264/AVC with a
set of new profiles and encoding tools that may be used to produce
scalable bitstreams. SVC supports three different types of scalability:
spatial scalability, temporal scalability, and quality scalability.
Temporal scalability is realized using the already existing reference
picture selection flexibility in H.264/AVC \[3\] as well as
bi-directionally predicted B-pictures. The prediction dependencies of
B-pictures are arranged in a hierarchical structure. Furthermore,
appropriate rate control is used to adjust the bit budget of each
picture to be proportional to its temporal importance in a procedure
called quantization parameter cascading. The slightly and gradually
reduced picture quality of the hierarchical B-pictures has been shown
not to significantly impact the subjective quality and the watching
experience, while showing high compression efficiency. Figure 5 shows an
example of the realization of temporal scalability using hierarchical
B-pictures. The example shows 4 different temporal levels, resulting in
one base layer and 3 temporal enhancement layers. This allows the frame
rate to be scaled by a factor up to 8 (e.g. from 60Hz to 7.5Hz). This
approach has the drawback that it incurs a relatively high decoding
delay that is exponentially proportional to the number of temporal
layers, since the pictures have to be decoded in a different order than
their display order. As the coding gain also diminishes with the
increasing number of hierarchy levels, it is not appropriate to generate
a high number of temporal layers. An alternative to the above mentioned
approach for temporal scalability is the use of low-delay
uni-directional prediction structures, hence avoiding the
out-of-display-order decoding at the cost of reduced coding efficiency.

![](media/image9.wmf){width="6.065972222222222in"
height="2.6993055555555556in"}

Figure 5: Temporal scalability with hierarchical B-picture structure in
SVC

Spatial scalability is the most important scalability type in SVC. It
enables encoding a video sequence into a video bit stream that contains
one or more subset bit streams and where each of these subsets provides
a video at a different spatial resolution. The spatially scalable video
caters for the needs of different consumer devices with different
display capabilities and processing power. Figure 6 depicts an example
for a prediction structure for spatial scalability (QCIF to CIF
resolution). The spatial scalability layer is enhanced with an
additional temporal scalability layer that doubles the frame rate at the
CIF resolution.

![](media/image10.wmf){width="5.895138888888889in"
height="3.1729166666666666in"}

Figure 6: Example prediction structure for spatial scalability

SVC defines three different inter-layer prediction modes that are
designed to enable the single-loop low complexity decoding at the
decoder. In other words, motion compensation is performed only once at
the target layer at the decoder. The inter-layer prediction tools are
inter-layer INTRA (texture) prediction, inter-layer motion prediction,
and inter-layer residual prediction.

Inter-layer INTRA prediction enables texture prediction from the base
layer at co-located macro-blocks (after upsampling). It is restricted to
INTRA coded macroblocks at the lower layer. The up-sampling of the
macroblock texture is performed using well-specified up-sampling filters
(a 4-tap filter for Luma samples and bi-linear filter from chroma
samples). Inter-layer motion prediction implies prediction of the base
layer motion vector from the co-located INTER-coded macro-block (after
upsampling) of the lower layer. The prediction involves all components
of the motion vector: the macro-block partitioning structures, the
reference picture indices, and the x- and y- components representing the
motion direction. Finally, the inter-layer residual prediction allows
inter-layer prediction from the residual after INTER-prediction at the
lower layer. At the decoder side, the residual information of the target
layer is built up by summing all correctly up-scaled residuals of the
lower dependent layers.

The third prediction type in SVC is quality scalability. Quality
scalability enables the achievement of different operation points, each
yielding a different video quality. Coarse Grain Scalability (CGS) is a
form of quality scalability that uses the same tools as the spatial
scalability, hence operating in the spatial domain. Alternatively,
Medium Grain Scalability (MGS) may be used to achieve quality
scalability performing the inter-layer prediction at the transform
domain. Two techniques are advocated for MGS scalability: splitting
number of transform coefficients and encoding difference of transform
coefficients quantized using different quantization parameters. MGS
significantly reduces the complexity at encoder and decoder. CGS may be
seen as a variant of spatial scalability where the spatial scaling
factor is set to one. Quality scalability may be used to address
different use cases such as rate adaptation or for offering a high
quality pay service.

SVC MGS scalability offers an increased flexibility for bit stream
adaptation and error robustness. Scalable streams providing a variety of
bit rates can be effectively encoded. For MGS coding in SVC, two new
features have been introduced: *motion-compensated prediction for the
base layer from the enhancement* layer and the supported of so-called
*key pictures*.

These concepts are illustrated in Figure 7.

Figure 7: Key picture concept of SVC for hierarchical prediction
structures

The first feature enables a simple but effective drift control for
hierarchical prediction structures. For each picture it is signalled
whether the base layer representation (when available) or the
enhancement layer representation of the reference pictures is employed
for motion-compensated prediction. Pictures that use the base layer
representation for motion-compensated prediction are called *key
pictures* (see Figure 7). This has the advantage that if any enhancement
layer data are lost, no drift occurs between encoder and decoder
reconstruction.

##### 6.1.1.1.2 Solution Configuration

For the purposes of improved video support in 3GPP services, a profile
of SVC \[3\] is selected that allows backwards compatibility to basic
terminals. This is inherently provided by SVC by requesting the base
layer to be H.264/AVC \[3\] compatible. Furthermore, it has to be
ensured that the base layer also conforms to the minimal requirements
for basic services. In order to ensure the conformance with the
constrained baseline profile of H.264/AVC \[3\]. SVC has to be used
according to the Scalable Baseline profile with the same constraints.

Additionally, the level selection for a base layer has to be aligned
with the minimal level requirements for 3GPP services. For enhancement
layers, the level selection is proposed to be set to level 3, which has
the following characteristics:

The proposed solution should be optional for service provider and for
UE. Appropriate mechanisms to properly announce and setup the session
(either including or excluding enhancement layers) are available or
should be extended. If UE supports SVC and it detects that the service
also provides SVC enhancement layer(s), then the UE is able to consume
the service at an improved quality/resolution.

### 6.1.2 Solution Integration Approaches

#### 6.1.2.1 Rate Adaptation for PSS using SVC with Priority-Based Transmission Scheduling

This solution integration is related to the use case \"Rate adaptation
in PSS when entering bad reception conditions\" (subclause 5.1.3.1).

In order to overcome outages and phases with reduced bit rate, a
priority-based transmission scheduling (PBTS) algorithm is proposed to
be used to pre-buffer larger amounts of more important data for longer
playouts than data with less importance for the resulting video playout
quality. The adaptation of the transmission scheduling and the media
rate is only based on buffer status reports from client to PSS server as
depicted in Figure 8.

![](media/image12.wmf){width="6.729861111111111in"
height="1.5069444444444444in"}

Figure 8: Transmission scheduling and media rate adaptation based on
priority based buffer status reports

Typically, the size of a UEs buffer is fixed which is assumed in this
scenario. The maximum buffering time is depicted in Figure 8 for a
standard buffer with one media quality and a priority based buffer with
exemplary two quality levels, either temporal, spatial or quality levels
or combination of those.

![](media/image13.wmf){width="2.292361111111111in"
height="2.2416666666666667in"}

Figure 9: Priority (PBTS) buffer using different qualities (*Q1* and
*Q2*) vs. standard buffer with one quality (Q), with *t+y* respectively
*t* being the maximum sustainable outage time

In this example, the maximum buffer time for the standard buffer is *t,*
which is dependent on the bit rate of the video stream (Q). The priority
buffer allows to prebuffer a longer time of the lowest quality level
(Q1) *t+y* by reducing the prebuffer time of the higher quality level
(Q2) to *t-x*, where *t+y* and *t-x* depend on the bit rate of the
quality levels.

To fill up a standard buffer, the PSS server uses a transmission
scheduling in decoding order of the video stream. Whereas to fill up a
priority based buffer, the PSS server uses a priority based transmission
scheduling, where it first fills up the lowest quality level to *t+y*
and after that the higher quality layer to *t-x*. After that it switches
to the standard transmission scheduling in decoding order.

When the UE enters difficult reception conditions, the available bit
rate may no longer be sufficient for the transmission of the highest
quality. Having a standard buffer, in such a case users would experience
a video outage. In case of having a buffer filled with a priority
scheduling algorithm, the high quality data in the buffer runs out
earlier than lower qualities. Using SVC, the PSS server would adapt the
media stream bit rate to the available service bit rate by dropping
quality layers, which still allows to keep the buffer state of the
lowest quality level fully filled. Compared to the use of a standard
buffer, the highest quality runs out even faster with the priority based
approach. Nevertheless, the priority based scheduling allows for keeping
the playout alive during longer outages than in the standard case.

Dependent on the buffer reports, the PSS streaming server adapts the
media stream bit rate to the quality of the available service bit rate.
If the clients\' reception condition allows a higher quality, the
transmission scheduling is adapted to allow rebuffering of the priority
buffer to the maximum quality of the available service bit rate.

Although PBTS can be based on H.264/AVC temporal scalability (AVC-PBTS),
SVC has the handy advantage to allow a bit rate reduction using quality
or spatial scalability instead of relying on pure temporal scalability
as described in \[4\].

#### 6.1.2.2 Rate Adaptation using SVC MGS Scalability

##### 6.1.2.2.1 Rate Adaptation Approach

The SVC bit rate adaptation approach is based on multiple Operation
Points within the same MGS-encoded scalable stream. An Operation Point
(OP) is defined as a unique combination of temporal and quality levels,
where reasonable combinations of different pairs of Temporal ID and
Quality ID are selected in a way so that OPs can be dropped from the bit
stream one after the other. An SVC MGS bit-stream consists of different
NAL (Network Abstraction Layer) units with different importance for the
decoding process. A Quality ID indicating the quality level and a
Temporal ID indicating the temporal level are included in the NAL unit
SVC header extension of each SVC NAL unit.

Tables 3 and 4 show for example a number of reasonable combinations of
different pairs of Temporal ID and Quality ID regarding SVC encoding of
a video sequence with 2 MGS quality layers and respectively 4 (GOP 8)
and 5 (GOP 16) temporal levels. Operation points are chosen in such a
way that at least the base layer stream remains and the frame rate of a
stream isn\'t reduced. If necessary, streams with reduced frame rates
can be also built.

From one row to the next row below, exactly one additional pair of {T,
Q} is dropped from the SVC bit stream. The bit rate of a video stream is
decreased by choosing of the next highest Operation Point (OP) for this
stream and dropping all packets which are not needed for decoding the
content at this OP. In this way an efficient bit rate adaptation is
achieved.

Figure 10 shows an example for the composition of each frame within a
GOP for the OPs highlighted in the Table 2. It becomes apparent that
dropping the quality layers Q1 of the temporal levels T2 and T3 reduces
the video rate from x to y (OP2). Further, dropping the quality layer Q1
of all temporal levels results to the video bit rate of *z* (OP4) where
*z \< y \< x*. In general, several OPs can be selected for bandwidth
optimization. It should be noted that the base layer should be selected
at an acceptable quality for the viewer, in order to limit the quality
degradation of the video.

##### 6.1.2.2.2 Example

Table 4 illustrates an example of the rate adaptation approach using the
SVC MGS scalability with three quality layers and multiple operation
points for the given video test sequence *IceDance* \[19\] at 720p
resolution and 50 fps (GOP 8).

For each combination of remaining NAL units, corresponding to a certain
temporal and quality layer, the average bit-rate and the corresponding
average PSNR value are given in the rightmost columns. The rows are
sorted according to the resulting PSNR value in descendent order. Note
that the frame rate is kept constant until OP8. As soon as only the base
layer bit-stream remains (OP 8, shaded in green), dropping of the
temporal layers starts, and hence streams with reduced frame rates can
be built.

#### 6.1.2.3 Unequal Error Protection with SVC in eMBMS

The presented solution is related to the use cases \"Graceful
Degradation in MBMS services when entering bad reception conditions\"
(subclause 5.1.3.2) and \"Combined support of heterogeneous devices and
Graceful Degradation\" (subclause 5.1.3.4).

The layered structure of SVC allows for transmission of the video in
separate network streams. Thereby, SVC allows services providing
different quality steps either by temporal, spatial, quality scalability
or combination of those. Using unequal error protection (UEP), such a
service can provide different quality levels of different robustness,
which allows for Graceful Degradation behaviour in MBMS scenarios. An
exemplary UEP scheme is depicted in Figure 9, where the more important
layer (Base) has a higher protection than the enhancement layers.

height="1.1076388888888888in"}

Figure 15: UEP (Unequal Error Protection): Important packets are
protected with higher code rate

In the exemplary scenario in Figure 16, there are two layers, using
quality, spatial or temporal scalability or combinations of those, with
different robustness. UEs in good reception conditions will receive the
highest quality and UEs entering worse reception conditions can still
receive the base layer, which results in a drop in quality when entering
bad reception conditions.

unequal error protection with SVC either with temporal, spatial or

Such a differentiation in robustness of the scalable layers can be
applied by a MBMS service at the application layer using different code
rates at the application layer forward error correction (AL-FEC).

In this subclause, we assume that multiple MBMS radio bearers of
different MCS (Modulation and Coding Scheme) levels \[6\] can be
allocated to each SVC layer. The high-priority base layer can be
transmitted using robust, but low rate MCS channel, while the
enhancement layers can be transmitted using high rate MCS channels. The
combined effect of allocating multi-level MCS channels for SVC is that
UEs in an area of good signal strength may receive all base and
enhancement layers, however the UEs in an area of poor signal strength
may only receive base layer data. Compared to the case where uniform MCS
level is assigned to MBMS bearers, the multi-level MCS allocation for
SVC is adaptive to channel condition and provides graceful quality
degradation.

For example, Figure 17 shows typical MBMS bearer allocation, that
H.264/AVC \[3\] single layer stream is allocated to a radio bearer of 16
QAM modulation. Assuming that eNodeB signal power is set to cover 90% of
the MBMS service area, UEs may loss data or experience service outage in
the rest of 10% area with this MCS allocation.

Figure 18 shows the case of SVC channel allocation where the radio
resource is divided to carry SVC layers in different MCS channels. The
base layer is transmitted using robust QPSK modulation, hence the signal
can reach almost entire area of MBMS cells. The remaining radio resource
is given to enhancement layers, therefore the enhancement layer needs
much higher rate channel. In this example, 64 QAM modulation channel is
allocated for transmitting enhancement data. Since the coverage of 64QAM
signal is smaller (e.g. less than 80%) than QPSK, only the UEs in 80%
area may receive high quality video. The quality may degrade in the rest
of 20% area, however it will be no worse than the minimum level (i.e.
base quality).

#### 6.1.2.5 Fast Stream Switching in eMBMS

In this subclause, a solution integration approach for fast MBMS stream
switching is presented.

In TS 22.246 subclause 5.1, it is stated that \"*The MBMS service shall
add no more than 1 second when switching between different TV streams to
any delay introduced with regards to the coding of the TV stream. It
shall be possible for an operator to configure the MBMS Television
service so that the typical switching time, from the end user\'s
perspective, does not exceed 2 seconds.*\"

In order to comply with the stringent latency requirement, a solution,
as depicted in **Figure 19**, is proposed that a bundle of base streams
is used for instant decoding of low resolution video while high
resolution video is being switched.

In **Figure 19**, it is assumed the content providers of MBMS TV service
support scalable video. The MBMS server (e.g. BMSC) separates base layer
streams from the received video streams and collects them into a bundle
of base streams (i.e. preview stream). The preview stream and
enhancement streams are transmitted in distinct MBMS bearers. Baseline
UEs are able to decode low quality video using the preview stream, while
advanced type UEs receive both the preview stream and the enhancement
stream, and decode the high quality video as following description.

In the initial service start-up phase, the advanced type UEs receive the
preview data and buffer them for sufficient period of time that can
exceed the latency for performing stream switching. This stream
switching latency usually includes the period for buffering,
de-interleaving, FEC recovery and decoding the high quality video, etc.
When the sufficient amount of preview data is stored, the advanced type
UE starts to receive enhancement data, and extracts base layer data from
the preview buffer, and decodes the scalable video. Old preview data is
disposed as new preview data is buffered.

When the user requests MBMS stream switching, the UE retrieves the base
data of the requested TV stream from the buffered preview data and
decodes low quality video instantly. While the low quality video is
being played, the UE performs stream switching to receive the
enhancement data stream. High quality video is recovered soon after the
enhancement stream switching is completed. As a result, the user does
not experience latency for stream switching except the initial decoding
delay of low quality video.

It is note that the similar feature of fast stream switching may also be
achieved using simulcast of H.264/AVC.

### 6.1.3 Performance Evaluation

#### 6.1.3.1 Unequal Error Protection in eMBMS

In this subclause, evaluation result of SVC UEP (Unequal Error
Protection) method against single layer H.264/AVC is presented. The
related use case is presented in subclause 5.1.3, and a solution of UEP
is described in subclause 6.1.2.3.

In this evaluation, MBSFN channel of 9*Mbps* throughput in 7 sectors
layout is applied commonly to the video streams. Only the ratio of
application layer FEC packets is manipulated to test the UEP
performance. In this experiment, Raptor code as in TS26.346 Multimedia
Broadcast/Multicast Service (MBMS) is used as an FEC method.

In order for fair comparison, the PSNR of H.264/AVC encoded source file
and SVC two layer files are produced to be identical (=35.4*dB*). Due to
slightly high coding overhead of SVC, the file size of SVC becomes 7% \~
15% larger than H.264/AVC file. Foreman QCIF and CIF sequences are
encoded with the JSVM 13.1. The bitrate of H.264/AVC stream is 398kbps,
while those of SVC base layer and enhancement layer are 48*kbps* and
383*kbps*, respectively if PSNR is set to be identical. Bitrate of SVC
in total is 431*kbps*, which is 8% more than that of H.264/AVC.

Since equal amount of radio resources should be allocated for
transmitting the AVC and SVC streams, the numbers of FEC redundancy
packets are adjusted to make the total amount of physical blocks of the
two streams identical. Therefore, FEC stream of 126*kbps* is added to
H.264/AVC stream, and FEC streams of 90*kbps* is added to SVC stream, as
a result, total bitrate of both codecs become 524 *kbps* (=
*video+parity*).

The code rate of H.264/AVC single layer including the FEC overhead is
0.72. The protection period of FEC is 4 GoP length (=2 seconds), of
which the size of GoP is 16 in 30*Hz* frame rate.

SVC two layer file is generated in 1:8 ratio of base: enhancement. The
code rate of base layer including the FEC overhead is 0.41, and 0.87 in
enhancement layer. Hence the base layer protection is enforced while
sacrificing the enhancement protection.

Detail of the sample file specification is further described below.

\% Common Factors:

GOP size: 16

FEC Protection Period: 4 GoP (=2 seconds)

MBSFN Layout: 7 sector layout (ISD=500 m)

Physical Channel: MCS-3, 64 QAM, 1/2 rate (=9 *Mbps* throughput)

The MBMS channel loss model described in Annex A is applied in this
experiment. The MBSFN signal transmission area and the service reception
area are identical in this layout, therefore the video quality at the
border cells of the MBSFN area are also considered in the evaluation. 9
*Mbps* throughput channel (i.e. 64QAM modulation and 1/2 coding rate) is
selected to apply the block loss rate equally to the AVC and SVC
streams. In consequence, PSNR performance, as described in following
equation, is measured at each coverage point.

In the example, the number of H.264/AVC video packets is 208 ***(=k),***
and the number of parity packets for it is 82. Therefore the coding
ratio ***(n, k) = (290, 208),*** where ***n*** is total sum of the
packets.

According to \[10\], the failure probability of Raptor is calculated as
following Equation (1).

![](media/image24.png){width="2.872916666666667in"
height="0.44166666666666665in"} (1)

In the Equation (1), ***m*** is the number of packets including video
and parity received correctly through the radio channel, and ***k*** is
the number of original video packets before transmission. Note that
***k*** doesn\'t include the number of parity packets. It is an
important characteristic of Raptor code that failure probability is
subject to ***m-k*** regardless of ***k***.

Assuming that we are measuring PSNR, GOP by GOP, the PSNR of AVC single
layer (i.e. ***PSNR~single~***(dB)) is calculated as following Equation
(2).

![](media/image25.jpeg){width="4.3180555555555555in"
height="0.4826388888888889in"}(2)

In the above Equation (2), it is assumed that a damaged GOP is replaced
by the last decoded frame of previous GOP, hence the ***PSNR~o~***
denotes the PSNR of the freezed GOP. ***P~sm~*** is the probability that
***m*** packets are received successfully among ***n*** transmitted
packets. This probability is typically calculated using Poison function.
***PSNR~s~*** is the original undamaged PSNR of the GOP.

The PSNR of SVC (i.e. ***PSNR~scalable~***(dB)) is calculated as
Equation (3) when it consists of only 2 layers.

![](media/image26.jpeg){width="4.875in"
height="0.8423611111111111in"}(3)

where, ***n~b~***: number of original base layer packets + parity
packets for base layer:

***k~b~***: number of base layer packets

***n~e~***: number of original enhancement layer packets + parity
packets for enhancement layer

***k~e~***: number of enhancement layer packets

***P~bi~***: probability that ***i*** packets are received successfully
among ***n~b~*** transmitted packets

***P~ej~***: probability that ***j*** packets are received successfully
among ***n~e~*** transmitted packets

***PSNR~0~***: PSNR of freezed GOP, when the whole GOP is damaged

***PSNR~b~***: PSNR of original undamaged base layer GOP

***PSNR~e~***: PSNR of original undamaged enhancement layer GOP

In Equation (3), note that ***P~f~ (i , k~b~)*** is the failure
probabilities of Raptor decoding given that ***i*** packets are received
out of ***n~b~*** transmitted packets. Similarly, ***P~f~ (j , k~e~)***
is the failure probabilities of Raptor decoding given that ***j***
packets are received out of ***n~e~*** transmitted packets.

Figure 20 shows the evaluation result of PSNR performance at each
coverage point. Note that the coverage in this context is the ratio of
area that can guarantee the level of PSNR in the 7 sector MBSFN area.

In the Figure 20, it is observed that the source file PSNR (=35.4*dB*)
of both the H.264/AVC stream and the SVC stream are maintained up to 45%
coverage. The PSNR of SVC (solid red curve) degrades to 27.5 *dB* which
is the PSNR of original base layer.

H.264/AVC (dotted line) results in the same PSNR until 55% coverage.
PSNR degrades thereafter. PSNR for SVC shows three PSNR levels, one
below 45% of 35.4*dB*, one between 45% and 60% coverage of 27.5*dB* and
one for greater 60% coverage.

may slightly be reduced, the effect of graceful quality degradation of
SVC is observed identical in different sector layouts.

#### 6.1.3.2 SVC Layer Aware Transmission for Coverage Improvement in eMBMS

In subclause 6.1.2.4, a solution for SVC layer aware bearer allocation
is described. In this subclause, the effect of Differentiated Modulation
(i.e. layer aware bearer allocation) when combined with application
layer UEP (Unequal Error Protection) method is presented. Similar to the
case of UEP, the PSNR performance of SVC, as described in equations (2)
and (3) in subclause 6.1.3.1, is evaluated to the case of single layer
H.264/AVC when the MBSFN channel loss model is applied.

In this evaluation, two MBSFN channels of 9*Mbps* throughput and 3*Mbps*
throughput are used for carrying SVC enhancement layer stream and base
layer stream respectively. The MBSFN signal transmission area and the
service reception area are identical in this layout, therefore the video
quality at the border cells of the MBSFN area are also considered in the
evaluation. In addition, FECs using Raptor code is applied to the two
streams in several different ratios to test the combined effect of UEP.
H.264/AVC stream is transmitted using 6*Mbps* throughput channel. Due to
different channel efficiency, the number of physical blocks used for
carrying the streams may be different. In order for fair comparison, the
same number of physical blocks are used for transmitting SVC streams and
AVC stream. Table 3 describes the MCS levels used in the three physical
channels and physical block size.

Table 7: MCS levels, data rates and physical block size

Soccer CIF and 4CIF sequences are encoded with the JSVM 13.1. The size
of H.264/AVC encoded file is 4,845,608 bits (PSNR = 35.2*dB*), and the
size of SVC encoded file is 5,082,762 bits (enhancement=4,565,728,
base=517,064). The number of FEC packets added to AVC file is 119, hence
the code rate of H.264/AVC single layer is 0.91. The protection period
of FEC is 4 GoP length (=2 seconds), of which the size of GoP is 16 in
30 *Hz* frame rate. Since 6*Mbps* throughput channel is used for
H.264/AVC, total 889 physical blocks are transmitted through the radio
channel. FEC redundancy packets for SVC layers are produced to match the
physical block usage of 889.

Three different FEC ratios are tested to evaluate the effect of UEP. In
the Case-1 test, 113 FEC packets are given to enhancement layer (code
rate = 0.91) and 115 FEC packets are assigned for base layer (code
rate=0.52). As a result, base layer pretention is enhanced while
sacrificing enhancement layer protection. In the Case-2 test,
enhancement layer data transmitted via 9*Mbps* channel is protected more
with FEC packets, and in the Case-3 test, the FEC coding ratio of the
enhancement layer and base layer are relatively even.

Detail of the sample file generation and FEC rates are described in
Table 8.

\% Common Factors

GOP size: 16

FEC Protection Period: 4 GoP (=2 seconds)

MBSFN Layout: 7 sector layout (ISD=500 m)

Figure 23 shows the evaluation result of PSNR performance at each
coverage point in 7 MBSFN sector layout.

In the Figure 23, it is observed that the source file PSNR (=35.2*dB*)
of both the H.264/AVC stream and the SVC stream are maintained up to 45%
area. The PSNR curves of the three UEP cases degrade in different
pattern respectively to the coding ratios of enhancement layers. The
Case-1 curve falls first because enhancement layer protection is weaker
than base layer protection. The Case-2 curve falls next and followed by
Case-2 curve in the order of FEC coding ratio of enhancement layer.

The video quality of H.264/AVC (dotted line) drops quickly to the
minimum level after the 67% coverage area, however the PSNR of SVC
streams maintain 30.2 *dB* up to 95% \~ 98% coverage. It is also
observed that the effect of base layer protection by FEC is relatively
minimal in the three cases, although the Case-2 curve drops slightly
earlier than others.

#### 6.1.3.3 SVC Layer Aware Transmission for Capacity Improvement in eMBMS

##### 6.1.3.3.1 Introduction

MBMS service delivery over MBSFN cannot adapt to the reception of
individual receivers. Delivery of Scalable Video Coding (SVC) coded
layered video data with different modulation and coding schemes (MCS)
for the individual layers could be used to cope with varying reception
conditions by providing physical layer unequal error protection (UEP).

Hierarchically layered video, such as SVC coded video, allows separate
transmission of video layers that can be decoded with graceful
degradation on the UE. Multi-level MCS allocation schemes can be used to
realise physical layer unequal error protection (PL-UEP) for the
individual SVC layers.

Based on the MCS schemes and BLER performance data in Figures A.2 to A.6
in Annex A, the presented results analyze the theoretical gain in terms
of additional services or capacity when using multi-level MCS SVC
transmission with physical layer UEP compared to single MCS AVC
transmission. It furthermore compares the theoretical results using SVC
with a similar setup using simulcast.

##### 6.1.3.3.2 Evaluation Setup

The presented setup targets a reduction of the overall required
transmission cost of a service by the use of SVC in combination with
PL-UEP. The general idea is to provide a basic quality using more robust
MCS and the quality enhancement layer using less robust MCS. In
comparison with a single layer service in the more robust MCS, such a
service could give the same robustness in terms of continuous playout
while allocating less resources in the more robust and more expensive
channel. The cost reduction is gained by providing lower quality video
to the users within bad reception conditions. UE with good reception
receive the SVC base and enhancement layer stream with highest quality
while UE with bad reception may only receive the lower quality SVC base
layer. The percentage of users with bad reception depends on the
difference in coverage of the chosen MCS schemes for base and
enhancement layer. Figure 26 shows an exemplary setup, where the AVC
single layer and the SVC base layer is allocated to MCS 1 and the
enhancement layer in MCS 2. The figure shows the resulting difference in
terms of coverage.

Figure 26: Exemplary setup considered in the evaluation

Three different transmission scenarios are under consideration. For
scenario A, AVC transmission with MCS 1 serves as reference for SVC
transmission using MCS 1 for the SVC base layer and MCS 2 for the SVC
enhancement layer. AVC Simulcast transmission of low quality (LQ)
streams with MCS 1 and high quality (HQ) streams with MCS 2 is evaluated
accordingly. Scenario B continues in this manner with higher MCS
schemes, as can be seen from Table 10.

Table 10: MCS levels for AVC and SVC layers for scenario A, B and C

  ------------ ------- ------------------ -------------------------
  *Scenario*   *AVC*   *SVC base layer\   *SVC enhancement layer\
                       Simulcast LQ*      Simulcast HQ*

  A            MCS 1   MCS 1              MCS 2

  B            MCS 2   MCS 2              MCS 3
  ------------ ------- ------------------ -------------------------

##### 6.1.3.3.3 Capacity Improvement

Transmission with multi-level MCS setup directly affects the achievable
data rate for a given bandwidth. For SVC and Simulcast transmission, MCS
are (time- or frequency-) multiplexed according to the SVC base layer
ratio or the ratio of Simulcast LW to Simulcast HQ bitrates, which will
be referred to as multiplex rate in the following. Thus, the channel
capacity for a given constant bitrate changes according to the multiplex
ratio. For instance, with 50% average base layer ratio of all SVC
services in scenario A, 50% of MCS 1 data rate for base layer (= 0.5
*Mbps*) plus 50% of MCS 2 data rate for enhancement layer (= 1.5 *Mbps*)
are available. AVC Simulcast transmission with a high quality AVC stream
of twice the bitrate in the low quality AVC stream behaves accordingly.
This leads to 2 *Mbps* total channel capacity for multi-level MCS SVC
transmission while single MCS AVC transmission with MCS 1 allows 1
*Mbps* at the same coverage.

A wide range of multiplex ratios has been considered in order to provide
multiple operation points with varying quality for the SVC base layer
and the Simulcast LQ stream. Note that the selection of optimal
operation point is considered to be up to the needs of the service
providers. For the selected scenarios, gains in terms of additional
channel capacity can be observed for SVC and AVC Simulcast transmission
compared to AVC transmission due to the multi-level MCS allocation, as
depicted in Figure 27.

height="2.4680555555555554in"}

Figure 27: Available data rate per scenario and SVC base layer ratio

The reference AVC stream for all following calculations has a bitrate of
500 *kbps*. In order to provide a satisfying quality of the SVC base
layer and of the Simulcast LQ stream, a bitrate range from 100 to 300
*kbps* has been considered, preserving equal quality of both. The SVC
enhancement layer and the Simulcast HQ stream are assumed to have the
same quality as the AVC reference stream. For overall evaluation, it is
further necessary to consider the coding overhead introduced by SVC.
Table 11 gives an exemplary calculation of gains in terms of additional
services with multi-level MCS SVC transmission compared to the 500
*kbps* reference AVC stream in scenario A. Available channel capacity
for AVC is 1 *Mbps* for MCS 1 in the selected scenario and a SVC
overhead of 10% is assumed. In Table 11 UCC refers to used channel
capacity which is the required channel allocation ratio per service. UCC
is calculated by the overall media bitrate divided by the AVC or SVC
channel capacity. E.g. for the AVC reference stream with 500 *kbps* and
the AVC channel capacity of 1 *Mbps* the AVC UCC is 50%. For SVC case at
a multiplex ratio of 18% the SVC UCC is calculated by the overall SVC
media bitrate of 550 *kbps* divided by the SVC Channel Capacity of 2636
*kbps* which leads to a SVC UCC of 21%.The number of services per
channel can be calculated by 1/UCC.

Figures A.2 to A.5 in Annex A give an estimate on the coverage of a
specific MCS setting given a minimum BLER. In order to establish a
satisfying quality in terms of image fidelity and continuous playout of
video without additional application-layer FEC, it is assumed that a
BLER of less than 0.001 has to be maintained. According to these
constrains, costs for multi-level MCS allocation with SVC or Simulcast
can be estimated for the specified scenarios. The difference in coverage
is calculated as the percentage of measured area that is provided only
low quality video. Table 8 give the coverage of all MCS schemes at a
BLER of 0.001 for different amounts of cooperating MBSFN cells and the
cost in terms of coverage.

##### 6.1.3.3.4 Performance Evaluation

This evaluation considers the most promising scenarios A and B which are
listed again in Table 10. Each scenario is investigated within an MBSFN
area that consists of 19 cooperating sectors of an 57 sectors cell
layout.

A set of target coverage areas was defined by a circle around the middle
sector, thus all user trajectories proceed within this target area. It
covers \~96% of the area of cooperating sectors in Scenario A and \~83%
in Scenario B, thereby omitting areas with bad reception in the AVC /
SVC base layer MCS, which are predominately located nearby the edge of
the cooperating sectors in the channel model. This is done to ensure a
well performing AVC transmission as reference for evaluation of
multi-level MCS SVC transmission.

The error trace files are generated in a simulation environment where
100 UEs randomly traverse the MBSFN area with the given restrictions and
cover a distance of 600 m, therefore total traversing distance is 60 km
(= 100 UE x 600 m). The simulation settings are described in detail in
Annex A. Figure 32 shows the trajectories of all UEs movement in a 19
sector layout (thick blue lines) with scenario A (left) and scenario B
(right) within the target coverage area (green circle), where the
colours of the trajectory represent the values of BLER measurements. The
top plots show the MCS used for AVC reference and SVC base layer,
whereas the bottom plots depict BLER values achieved by the MCS used for
the SVC Enhancement layer.

![](media/image39.wmf){width="5.488888888888889in" height="5.80625in"}

Figure 32: Trajectories of 100 UEs in 19 sector cell area with MCS1
(top) and MCS2 (bottom)

The distance between the measurement points is 1m. A pedestrian walking
speed is assumed, where the UE is moving at approximately 3.6 km/h (= 1
m / sec). Since the distance between the measurement points is 1m, the
period between measurements is 1 sec, and the total measurement time is
16,7 hours (= 100UEs x 600 measurement points x 1 sec / 3600). It is
assumed that the BLER of a measurement point generally represents the
average BLER experienced by the UE until moving 1 m to next measurement
point.

We compare a single layer AVC stream with an SVC stream using CGS with 2
layers. The source video consists of a concatenation of 4 sequences,
where each sequences has been encoded with a constant bitrate for AVC
and slightly higher bitrate for SVC in order to achieve a total average
bitrate of approximately 270kbit for AVC and 300kbit for SVC, leading to
a SVC overhead of about 10%. The GOP size is 8 frames at a frame rate of
15fps. The SVC Streams have been encoded with two unique base layer
ratios of roughly 30% and 50%. All coding parameters can be found in
Table 13.

All encodings provide approximately similar video quality in terms of
PSNR. The enhancement layer PSNR of the SVC stream with 30% base layer
ratio matches the AVC PSNR precisely, whereas the SVC stream with 50%
base layer ratio has 0.15*dB* lower PSNR quality on encoding side. This
is due to the limited rate control of the used JSVM reference encoder
and has to be considered when interpreting simulation results.

The selected video streams are encapsulated in RTP packets according to
their specific RTP payload format and subsequently into IP streams.
Real-time transmission of transport-blocks was simulated according to
the BLER measurements over time of the recorded UE traces as described
in Annex A. This process is repeated 100 times for each UE with a
time-seeded random generator in order to obtain statistically relevant
results.

Averaged frame-wise peak-SNR (PSNR) of the transmitted, decoded video is
used for the evaluation of video quality on the UE. Measurement of
playout robustness utilizes Erroneous Seconds Ratio (ESR). ESR is the
ratio of video seconds that contain at least an erroneous frame to the
length of the video in seconds. We use (1-ESR), where a measurement of
100% corresponds to an error free video and 0% translates into erroneous
frames within every second of the video.

Subsequently, quality evaluation of the transmission results was done as
described in \[16\]. This approach features precalculation of a PSNR
database based on real decoding with error concealment techniques.
Further evaluation of video quality in terms of PSNR is conducted on
packet-level, thus omitting redundant video decoding operations. ESR
measurements take coding dependencies of frames within the video into
account.

Due to the lower robustness for the SVC enhancement layer, users will
experience a graceful degradation behaviour when entering areas with bad
reception conditions of the enhancement layer. The simulation results
allow analyzing the video quality degradation experienced by users for
each scenario during traversing the user trajectories with transmission
scheduling scenario A and B using AVC, or SVC encodings. Figure 27 shows
the cumulative distribution of average user PSNR for both scenarios,
whereas Figure 33 shows the cumulative distribution of video quality
(PSNR) degradation of SVC compared to AVC. Note that SVC stream with 50%
base layer ratio has 0.15*dB* lower PSNR quality on encoding side, which
has to be considered when interpreting Figures 27 and 33. Furthermore,
Figure 34 shows the cumulative distribution of play out robustness (1 -
ESR) for AVC reference and SVC, where both SVC base layer ratios are
represented with a single line due to equal performance and for the sake
of legibility.

The results in Figure 27 and Figure 33 show that the average quality
degradation of both scenarios is below 0.2 dB in terms of PSNR. Less
than 5% of users experience a quality degradation of more than 0.3dB
PSNR and the maximum PSNR degradation observed in the simulation setup
is 0.46 dB for scenario A and 1.4dB for scenario B, where the latter is
experienced by an outlying single user with 99% of users experiencing a
quality degradation below 0.8 dB PSNR.

The (1-ESR) measurements in Figure 34 show the difference of base layer
(SVC ESR\_BL) and enhancement layer play out robustness (SVC ESR\_EL).
It can be seen that the play out robustness of AVC reference is
preserved for the SVC base layer when using multi-level MCS SVC
transmission.

#### 6.1.3.4 Graceful Degradation for MBMS Using SVC 

##### 6.1.3.4.1 Introduction

In this subclause, a test system for graceful degradation for MBMS Rel-6
is presented. Quality metrics for degraded video are introduced.
Furthermore, test results for graceful degradation in MBMS are given.

##### 6.1.3.4.2 Test system

Figure 36: Test system for graceful degradation in MBMS

A MBMS simulation chain has been built (Figure 36), which simulates
transmission of video and audio data over multiple streams over one MBMS
channel. Each of these streams can be protected with an MBMS standard
compliant Raptor FEC by different code rates. The MBMS channel is
simulated by using traces of MBMS loss patterns. The loss patterns
contain transport block (TB) loss probabilities for different
transmission powers and different bearer rates. Figure 36 shows the test
system. The Raptor FEC needs a small amount of additional received
symbol overhead λ for successful decoding. During the following
simulations this overhead is set to *λ = 3* *%* of the number of source
symbols. One FEC code block extends over *2s* considering the resulting
bitrate after RTP encapsulation.

The size of a transport block (TB) is fixed to 82 Byte. The number of
TBs in each TTI and the length of each TTI depend on the selected bearer
rate. Due to common channel coding and interleaving of the TBs in a TTI,
in our simulations either all TBs in a TTI are lost or all are not lost.

Table 14 depicts the settings for each bearer rate.

Table 14: MBMS parameters for simulating different bearer rates

The MBMS simulation is based on loss patterns measured in a simulated
MBMS Rel-6 system for different transmission power and bearer rates. The
main radio network simulation assumptions are listed in Table 15.
Details of the simulation assumptions can be found in \[13\]. 500 users
are dropped randomly and then traces are recorded for 40s while users
are moving. As users move with only 3km/h, users move only a few *10s*
of meters, so considering the inter-site distance of 1500m users can be
macroscopically regarded as stationary. Mainly the fast fading changes
during a trace.

Only the 128 *kBit/s* and 256 *kBit/s* bearers are used for the
simulations. For the 128 *kBit/s* case we used loss patterns with
transmission power from -13*dB* to -5*dB* (relative to *P~max~=17.4W*)
and for the 256 *kBit/s* we used loss patterns with transmission power
from -10*dB* to -2*dB*. Note that a double bearer rate requires approx.
3*dB* higher transmission power to provide similar loss behaviour.

Depending on the selected bearer rate the data of the media stream is
mapped on the MBMS transport blocks. The losses for each TTI are
simulated by comparing a random value with the probability of the
utilized loss pattern. If TTI is lost, all TBs of this TTI are lost too.

Figure 37 depicts the mapping of the RTP packets into the MBMS transport
blocks. First RTP packets are fragmented to fit the MTU size. The
resulting RTP fragment units are packed together with the parity packets
into IP packets. Then the IP packets are mapped into the transport
stream of the MBMS service.

##### 6.1.3.4.2 Test sequences

Three different test sequences are considered for simulation where each
of them containing an audio track. The associated properties are
depicted in Table 16.

Table 16: Properties of simulated video sequences

For both H.264/AVC and SVC encoding the JSVM 8.8 software was used in
the simulations. We used a hierarchical coding structure with a GOP size
of 16 and an I-frame period of around 2 seconds. In the SVC encodings,
we used SNR scalability with one MGS enhancement layer. The quantization
parameters were selected such that H.264/AVC and SVC bit streams
(including both base and enhancement layer) yielded similar PSNR values.

Audio encoding parameters are fixed for all sequences and test runs. The
bit rate is set to 32 *kBit/s* and the sample frequency to 48 *kHz*.

Figure 38 and Figure 39 depict the resulting bit rates for H.264/AVC and
SVC with one MGS layer encoding.

##### 6.1.3.4.4 Transmission Schemes

Six different transmission schemes are simulated. Two of them provide
single layer and four multilayer transmissions. The issue is to compare
different settings of multi layer transmission providing graceful
degradation behaviour by the use of application layer Raptor FEC or
power spreading between the different video layers (2--6) with single
layer transmission with and without additional application layer FEC
(1--2) . The abbreviations for each transmission scheme later used in
the results subclause are:

1\) Single layer transmission\
(\"**SingleLayer**\")

2\) Single layer transmission with additional raptor FEC\
(\"**SingleLayerFEC**\")

3\) Layered transmission with unequal error protection\
(\"Unequal Error Protection\" (**UEP**))

4\) Layered transmission over different transmission power\
(\"Unequal Transmit Power\" (**UTP**))

5\) Layered transmission over different transmission power and
additional FEC (**UTP\_FEC**)

6\) Layered transmission over different transmission power and
additional unequal error protection (**UTP\_UEP**)

Each transmission scheme has a certain transmission cost which is
affected by the transmission power and the total content bit rate. As
metric for the necessary transmission cost we define the \"Used cell
capacity\" (Ucc) metric. A Ucc value of 1 means, that the full
transmission capacity of a cell is necessary for transmitting one
\"Content channel\" with the selected transmission scheme. A Content
channel defines the transmission of one audio/video stream with the
selected transmission scheme.

**For instance, if Ucc value is about 0.3 there can be three \"Content
channels\" with the same characteristic (bit rate) provided in a certain
cell.**

**Used cell capacity (Ucc):**

Percentage of total cell capacity used for transmission of one content
channel.

**Example calculation with transmission scheme 6:**

*power~x~ (x = layer): power~1~ = -5dB; power~2~ = -7dB*

bit rate (including FEC): *b~1~ = 194 kBit/s; b~2~ = 48 kBit/s*;

Power fraction:

*pf~1~ = 10 ^power1/10^ = 10 ^-5/10^ = 0.32*;

*pf~2~ = 10 ^power2/10^ = 10 ^-7/10^ = 0.20*

Percentage of cell capacity used for payload transmission = 80 % (20%
pilots/control channels)

*Bearer rate~12~ = 256 kBit/s*

\- channels~1~ = 80% / pf~1~ = 0.8 / 0.32 = 2.5

\- channels~2~ = 80% / pf~2~ = 0.8 / 0.20 = 4.0

\- Total cell capacity~1~ = channels~1~ \* bearer rate~1~ = 2.5 \* 256
kBit/s = 640 kBit/s

\- Total cell capacity~2~ = channels~2~ \* bearer rate~2~ = 4.0 \* 256
kBit/s = 1024 kBit/s

*Percentage of used cell capacity~1~ = b~1~/Total cell capacity~1~ =
0.30*

*Percentage of used cell capacity~2~ = b~2~/Total cell capacity~2~ =
0.05*

***Ucc** = percentage of used cell capacity~1~ + percentage of used cell
capacity~2~ = 0.35*

***Content channels** = round(1 / Ucc) = 3*

##### 6.1.3.4.5 Quality metric

One major challenge is the quality evaluation of the received media
stream. The Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) measure is commonly used
in the area of video coding. According to \[21\], PSNR is not suited for
evaluating the effect of packet losses or freezing frames of a video.
Taking into account the work in \[19\] and \[20\] we defined appropriate
objective quality categories from maximum to inacceptable quality based
on three different measured values described below:

**Measured values:**

**1) Lost video play out\
**percentage of freeze frame which reflects the amount of losses in the
SVC base layer.\
à a value of 0.3 means 30 % of whole stream is affected by errors

**2) Lost audio play out**\
percentage of time where there is no audio\
à a value of 0.3 means 30 % of audio is lost

**3) Playout frames with reduced quality\
**percentage of non decodable SNR layer without freeze frames\
à a value of 0.3 means 30 % of all non referenced frames are lost

The four introduced quality categories try to reflect the scalability
behaviour using SVC with one SNR layer. The user experiences the
appropriate quality if the already described metrics lie in the
following defined ranges.

**Four quality categories:**

**1. Maximum:**

\- Lost video play out \< 0.02 &&

\- Lost audio play out \< 0.02 &&

\- Playoutframes with reduced quality \< 0.02

**2. Medium:**

\- Lost video play out \< 0.02 &&

\- Lost audio play out \< 0.02 &&

\- Playoutframes with reduced quality \< 0.7

**3. Minimum:**

\- Lost video play out \< 0.1 &&

\- Lost audio play out \< 0.1 &&

\- Playoutframes with reduced quality \<= 1

**4. Inacceptable:**

\- Lost video play out \>= 0.1 \|\|

\- Lost audio play out \>= 0.1

To get an overview of the received quality in a transmission cell, we
define the \"Coverage\" metric which shows the percentage of users
receiving at least a certain quality.

Example**:** 250 out of the total of 500 users achieve constraints of
medium quality à Coverage of simulated transmission scheme at medium
quality is 50 % coverage.

##### 6.1.3.4.6 Simulation Results 

For SVC, two layer transmission schemes are applied whereas audio and
video base layer belong to one transmission layer (with higher FEC
protection and/or higher transmission power) and the video SNR layer to
another transmission layer.

For the different transmission schemes, FEC code rates (in the range
between 0.4 and 1.0) and transmission power levels are varied. The plots
in this subclause show coverage at the y-axis and Ucc at the x-axis.

Results are given for the sequence \"Reuter\". Figures 41 to 43 show the
results for all transmission settings for each quality category.

#### 6.1.3.5 Coding Results using KTA 

##### 6.1.3.5.1 Experimental Setup

In this subclause, QVGA/VGA encoding using SVC and an optimized
H.264/AVC encoder is compared.

For the experiments, the publicly available JSVM 9.17 and KTA 2.3
software packages \[14\] and \[8\] are used. The simulation settings
were aligned with the VCEG recommended simulation conditions \[15\].

Four publicly available test sequences were used (Table 17). For each
sequence a basis resolution (QVGA) and an enhanced resolution (VGA) is
used, so as to compare SVC spatial scalability against H.264/AVC coding.

Table 17: Test sequences

  ---------- ------------------ ---------------------

  ---------- ------------------ ---------------------

For SVC encoding, the scalable baseline profile is used. For H.264/AVC
encoding, baseline profile for encoding of the basis resolution and high
profile for encoding of the enhanced resolution is used. The common
coding tools that were used in the SVC and H.264/AVC simulations are
shown in Table 18. (A complete description of the coding settings for
JSVM and KTA are provided in attachment A). Note that KTA was operated
in H.264/AVC mode, which means that only H.264/AVC compliant coding
tools were used.

For KTA simulations, a QP range of 22-37 was used. For JSVM simulations,
{37, 33, 29, 25} was used as base layer QPs, and a QP offset of 2, i.e.
the corresponding enhancement layer QPs were {39, 35, 31, 27}.

On average, SVC induces average bit rate costs of 5.6% and 28.1% over
non-scalable H.264/AVC at QVGA and VGA resolution, respectively. The
average SVC bit rate reduction over H.264/AVC simulcast is 2.9%.

#### 6.1.3.6 Coding Results using JSVM

##### 6.1.3.6.1 JSVM

The JSVM (Joint Scalable Video Model) software is the reference software
for the Scalable Video Coding (SVC) project of the Joint Video Team
(JVT) of the ISO/IEC Moving Pictures Experts Group (MPEG) and the ITU-T
Video Coding Experts Group (VCEG). JSVM can be used to encode standard
compliant H.264/AVC streams as well as scalable video streams.

##### 6.1.3.6.2 Experimental Setup

In the conducted experiments, we used the JSVM software package version
9.17 \[14\].

The presented encodings are comprised of a 2-layer SVC based stream with
SNR or resolution scalability. The respective resolutions used in our
tests were 320x240 to 320x240 (QVGA/QVGA) for SNR scalability
(Configuration 1 and configuration 2).

are depicted in Table 23.

##### 6.1.3.6.5 Results

The Rate-Distortion (RD) curves for the selected sequences are shown in
subclauses 6.1.3.6.5.1 and 6.1.3.6.5.2

The plots show the performance of SVC and AVC encodings. Each plot shows
the Rate-Distortion (RD) curve for the base layer (AVC 0) and the
enhancement layer (SVC 1) as well as for the corresponding single layer
(AVC 1) providing the same quality level as the SVC enhancement layer
and the accumulated simulcast curve.

Sample configuration files used to generate these results can be found
in the Attachment B.

The video sequences used in this subclause are publicly available.

#### 6.1.3.7 Caching Efficiency Improvement with SVC for Adaptive HTTP VoD

##### 6.1.3.7.1 Overview

Adaptive HTTP streaming in a VoD system takes advantage of the widely
deployed network caches to relieve video servers from sending the same
content to a high number of users in the same access network. Since the
connection characteristics may vary over the time, with adaptive
Streaming over HTTP, a technique that has been recently proposed, video
clients may dynamically adapt the requested video quality for ongoing
video flows, to match their current download rate as good as possible.
One possibility to provide adaptive streaming over HTTP is to encode
multiple representations of each of the videos with H.264/AVC at the
server and offer them side-by-side. Another is offering all these
representations embedded in one file via Scalable Video Coding (SVC).
The presented simulations compare the impact of multiple chunk based
content representations on the caching efficiency either using H.264/AVC
or SVC. Similar simulation results within an HTTP based progressive
download scenario have already been presented in \[22\].

Figure 60 schematically shows a network over which a video library is
offered by a Video on Demand (VoD) service. The operator of the access
network (i.e., the cloud in the figure), offers connectivity to its
customers via access links and connects to the Internet (where the
content library is offered on an origin server by a third party) over a
\"transit\" link, in the following referred to as the cache feeder link.
In that way the customers of the access network operator can access
video content, in particular the movies on the origin server. The
network operator deploys a proxy and a cache in its network to minimize
the amount of transmitted data through the \"transit\" link relieving
the server of having to send an extremely high amount of video data.
Since the cache is usually too small to host the complete video library
and the content library on the origin video server often changes, the
video files that are stored in the cache at every moment need to be
carefully selected. This is accomplished by an appropriate caching
algorithm.

Figure 60: A typical network, hosting a cache, over which content is
offered.

There are many different cache replacement algorithms that have been
proposed over the last years that optimize the caching performance based
on some special criteria. Most algorithms make decisions based either on
how recently an object has been requested or on how frequently an object
has been requested over a time period or a combination thereof. In
\[21\] the chunk-based delivery (video files downloaded in smaller parts
thereof, i.e. chunks/segments) is exploited in a caching context. In
this work the chunks that will be consumed in a near future with a high
probability are predicted, assuming that it is very likely that a user
playing chunk n of a given video file at the current moment will play
chunk ***n+k*** of the same video file ***k*** time instants later.

##### 6.1.3.7.2 Effect of Multiple Representations on the Caching Efficiency

In this contribution, we consider the scenario where users may request a
certain video clip in one of a possible set of resolutions or quality
versions. Hence, each video offered by the origin server must be encoded
in a given number (N) of bit rates. These N versions can be encoded
separately with AVC and offered side by side, a scenario we refer to as
\"Multi-Representation VoD (MR-VoD)\", or can be embedded in a
multi-layer representation which allows for further separation into file
subsets (layers) using SVC, a scenario we refer to as \"SVC-VoD\". We
discuss the impact of the former first and comment on the latter.

Compared to the scenario in which only one version is offered (which we
refer to as the \"Single-Representation VoD (SR-VoD)\" scenario), in the
MR-VoD scenario, the requests for a particular video clip are
distributed over its *N* versions.

height="2.567361111111111in"}

Figure 61: Caching efficiency reduction result of offering a higher
variety of representations\
(e.g. 4) for each file

If each of the versions associated with a video clip is requested with
more or less equal probability, the ranking in the MR-VoD scenario is
almost the same as in the scenario with only one version: instead of
occurring only once, each video clip occurs N times in that ranking, but
with high probability in a block of N consecutive ranks. A consequence
of this is that if a certain version of a video is cached it is highly
likely that all other versions need to be cached as well. Consequently,
in order to attain the same cache-hit-ratio in the MR-VOD scenario as in
the SR-VOD scenario, the cache should be able to store all N versions of
the video instead of just one. Since storing N versions side by side
requires more storage, a larger cache size/capacity is needed to attain
the same hit ratio. Conversely, if the same cache capacity is used, a
lower cache-hit-ratio results, as illustrated in Figure 61. Note that
based on a similar reasoning (and as described in more detail in clause
6.1.3.7.3) the SVC-VoD scenario could attain the same hit ratio with
practically the same cache size.

##### 6.1.3.7.3 Scalable Video Coding and Impact on the Caching Efficiency

The main difference between MR-VoD and SVC-VoD is illustrated in Figure
62. It can be seen that by using SVC much more video clips at different
representations can be stored in the cache, while with MR-VoD many files
have to be removed from the cache to obtain additional space for the new
incoming files or versions of them.

![](media/image69.wmf){width="3.0034722222222223in"
height="2.341666666666667in"}

Figure 62: Caching performance comparison for MR-VoD and SVC-VoD

When considering a VoD service with multiple available representations
based on layers of SVC, first the amount of data that has to be
transmitted to and stored in the cache is reduced compared to the MR-VoD
case, and second, more clients request the same data (layers) since
clients requesting different representations of a same video clip are
expecting to receive a set of layers, where some layers are common for
all of those requests, e.g. the base layer. Thus, the HTTP request for a
certain quality results in a multiple HTTP request for each of the
mentioned layers and all requests for a single content incorporate at
least the base layer representation. Consequently, the probability of a
cache-hit for files containing the lowest layers of SVC streams, which
most of the users are interested in, is increased.

Note that requesting multiple layers for each segment could be done in
twofold manner. One is within one single TCP connection requesting each
layer after the other. The first approach (single TCP connection)
introduces additional buffering requirement (for lower layer segments)
at the clients, in addition to the playout delay, since client has to
wait until highest layer segment is received before playout can start.
Another possibility could be to setup parallel TCP connections. The
second approach (parallel TCP connections) would reduce (but not
eliminate) this buffering and playout delay but introduces additional
HTTP overhead (new connection per layer). The simulation results analyze
the effect of different video codings on the caching efficiency.
Therefore, the impact on the buffering requirements at the clients and
the additional HTTP overhead is not considered here.

##### 6.1.3.7.4 Caching Algorithm

The performance of the cache is here analyzed for two different caching
algorithms (operating on chunks):

> • LRU: where the most recently requested chunks are kept in the cache.
>
> • CC: An algorithm described in \[1\] that takes into account the
> number of guaranteed hits of chunks (if the HTTP streaming client
> keeps on selecting the same version as it currently does), which uses
> an improved movie content scoring algorithm that combines the LRU and
> LFU basics.

In case of considering SVC there are n chunks per time interval, where n
corresponds to the number of layers. In other words, the layers are
transmitted and stored in the cache separately and therefore count as
different objects for the cache-hit-ratio evaluation. In case of
offering the n version side by side via AVC, each time interval has n
independent versions, in the sense that if one version is cached and
another is requested no cache hit can be counted.

##### 6.1.3.7.5 Congestion Control

Clients (on the same access network) of a multimedia service typically
share (transport and caching) resources with other multimedia clients
and/or users downloading any type of data from the Internet, which
produces some cross-traffic in the network causing congestion. This
results in a temporarily reduced available download rate for the clients
of the service.

These clients (HTTP streaming-clients) detect these variations in the
connection rate available to them and adapt the bit rate at which they
download their ongoing video stream, by requesting the following
chunks/segments in an appropriate version. Therefore, every time a user
requests a new chunk of a video an additional decision has to be made
with respect to which version it will be download. This choice depends
on:

• The capability of the terminal of the user.

• The congestion state between the cache and the end user (i.e., the
access). If requesting the version that a user wants to download would
congest the link, this request is downgraded as many times as needed to
alleviate congestion.

On the access link other services run (i.e., a user may be downloading a
large file, may be browsing the web, etc.) besides the HTTP streaming
video client streaming a video. This type of congestion can occur any
time of the day and is not necessarily restricted to peak hours. The
model for this type of congestion that we have simulated in this paper
is shown in Figure 63. This figure illustrates a Markov-chain with four
states corresponding to four possible download rates and selected OPs.

![](media/image70.wmf){width="3.1222222222222222in"
height="1.0743055555555556in"}

Figure 63: Model for congestion due to cross-traffic

In fact we assume that the cross traffic on the access link which is the
result of sharing this link with one or more HTTP streaming clients or
any other client requesting data from the Internet is such that the HTTP
streaming client requesting the version in the next slot, can be
described by a Markov chain.

As seen in Figure 63 this Markov chain consists of four states where the
transition probabilities ***p~ij~*** of the transition matrix
***P=*\[*p~ij~*\]** with ***\| j-i \|\>1*** are set to zero, i.e. it is
only possible to go from a state to its neighbour states. The rest of
the parameters (represented in the figure) were set to values that lead
to realistic situations.

The most important parameters to take into account to consider whether
the selected values correspond to a realistic situation or not are the
mean state sojourn time (mean duration of being in a state:
***E*\[*t~i~*\]**) and average percentage of time in each of the states
(***p~i~***), which can be derived easily from the transition
probabilities, as shown in ***Eq.(4)*** and ***Eq.(5)***.

(4)

![](media/image72.wmf){width="0.9638888888888889in" height="0.35in"} (5)

where, ***π={p~1~,p~2~,p~3~,p~4~}***is the left eigenvector of ***P***
(associated with eigenvalue 1), a.k.a. steady state vector, which
fulfils

![](media/image73.wmf){width="0.6354166666666666in"
height="0.5159722222222223in"} (6)

The simulation time step in the presented Markov-chain model corresponds
to the selected chunk size, since the adaptation is performed by the
HTTP streaming clients on a chunk basis.

##### 6.1.3.7.6 Performance Targets

In order to compare the system where the different version of a video
are offered encoded in AVC side by side with the system in which the
versions are embedded in one SVC stream, we consider cache-hit-ratio and
cache capacity:

• The cache-hit-ratio: calculated on a chunk basis, or when SVC is
considered on smaller objects, corresponding to each of the layers of
each of the chunks. It represents the percentage of these objects that
can be served from the cache and do not need not to be transported over
the cache feeder link.

> • The cache capacity is measured in media units, which are equivalent
> to the size of a video clip of 90 minutes at 500 *kbps* (1 media
> unit=337.5 MB).

##### 6.1.3.7.7 Simulation Results

The results presented in the following show the performance of the
system comparing both multiple representations encoded with AVC (MR-VoD)
offered side-by-side and multiple representations encoded with SVC
(SVC-VoD). The rate distribution for the different video representations
is summarized in the table below with an SVC overhead of 10% using bit
rate adaptation with quality scalability and one quality layer as
similarly shown in \[22\].

Each of the video clips is offered at four different encoding bitrates.
The bitrate assumptions for AVC and SVC encodings are summarized in
Table 34.

Table 34: Rate distribution for the video representations

  ----- ------------ ------------- ------------- -------------
        Rep. 1       Rep.2         Rep.3         Rep. 4
  AVC   500 *kbps*   1000 *kbps*   1500 *kbps*   2000 *kbps*
  SVC   500 *kbps*   1066 *kbps*   1633 *kbps*   2200 *kbps*
  ----- ------------ ------------- ------------- -------------

The chunk length is 10s.

The results shown in Table 3 correspond to the case where the bottleneck
is the access link, as a consequence of some cross-traffic produced by
other users. The transition probabilities can be found in the following
transition matrix.

![](media/image74.wmf){width="1.9166666666666667in"
height="0.7833333333333333in"}

The shown transition probabilities correspond to an adaptive HTTP client
that spend on average an equal percentage of time in each state of 25%,
in the following referred to as heavy cross traffic.

Table 35: Cache-hit-ratio for congestion in access links

+----------------+--------+-----------------+--------+-----------------+
| Cache capacity | LRU    | CC              |        |                 |
|                |        |                 |        |                 |

+----------------+--------+-----------------+--------+-----------------+
| 500            | 30.9 % | 45.6 % (+14.7%) | 42.9 % | 56.6 % (+13.7%) |
+----------------+--------+-----------------+--------+-----------------+
| 1000           | 42.1 % | 58.2 % (+16.1%) | 52.0 % | 64.5 % (+12.5%) |
+----------------+--------+-----------------+--------+-----------------+
| 2000           | 54.6%  | 69.0% (+14.4%)  | 61.5%  | 72.0% (+11.5%)  |
+----------------+--------+-----------------+--------+-----------------+

The results in Table 35 show the difference between the use of AVC and
SVC for both caching algorithms LRU and CC. Different versions of the
requested videos are stored in the cache which leads to a spoilage of
the available storing capacity of the cache when a single layer codec is
considered, whereas when SVC is used the available resources are much
more efficiently used. Furthermore, the hit-ratio increases due to the
fact that many users make requests for the same data since, even though
they may be interested in different version of the same video, their
requests are split into multiple request, one associated with each layer
that they are requesting. Since the layers built on top of each other, a
user requesting layer ***k***, needs to request layer 1 to ***k-1***
too. In particular the base layer is requested by everyone.

Since the difference between both AVC and SVC are more disparate for
this case we have conducted the simulations for a higher range of values
for cache capacity (***C***) only focusing on the LRU caching algorithm,
leading to the results shown in Figure 64.

![](media/image75.wmf){width="3.325in" height="2.588888888888889in"}

Figure 64: Congestion due to heavy cross traffic

In this figure, the cache-hit-ratio over cache capacity is depicted. It
can clearly be seen how the use of SVC improves the performance of the
system in terms of cache-hit-ratio compared to the use of MR-VoD. It is
also noticeable that the cache-hit-ratio for the AVC case is even lower
than for the highest layer (layer 4) when SVC is used almost for all
cache capacity values, since the storage capacity at the cache runs out
faster with the higher diversity in requested files due to using the
MR-VoD approach. Furthermore, the caching performance for the base layer
is significantly higher compared to the other files and layers as the
number of request for this is higher than for the other layers or
different representations when AVC is considered.

The increased cache hit ratio leads to an reduced traffic through the
\"transit\" link, which is shown in Figure 65 for SVC-VoD and MR-VoD for
heavy cross traffic and LRU algorithm.

Figure 67: Cache hit-ratio for different SVC encoding overhead (0% to 20
%)

Figure 68 shows the cash-hit-ratio for a different set up of the
simulation, simulating a situation with less heavy cross traffic,
resulting in the HTTP streaming client residing in the highest state (4)
more often. In this case, the percentage of time in each state is
unequal with ***p**={9.1%, 9.5%, 19.1%, 62.3%}*, as well as the mean
state sojourn time ***E*\[*t~i~*\]***=(approx.){2s, 2s, 10s, 40s}*,
which may be closer to that which may happen in the reality. The
correspondent transition matrix is shown below:

![](media/image79.wmf){width="1.9166666666666667in"
height="0.7833333333333333in"}

![](media/image80.wmf){width="3.325in" height="2.588888888888889in"}

Figure 68: Cache hit-ratio for congestion due to light cross traffic

Although the variety of versions requested for this set up is supposed
to be lower than in the case before, the gains of SVC-VoD compared to
MR-VoD are still noticeable. Due to this reduced variability the MR-VoD
performs slightly better than before but still quite poorly when
compared to SVC-VoD. It can be also clearly seen how the cache-hit-ratio
for the base layer is reduced (layer 1) and the cache-hit-ratio for the
highest layer is increased (layer 4). If we keep on reducing the
congestion all lines would converge.

The SVC penalty influences the traffic on the last mile. It is
influenced by the SVC coding penalty itself but also by the congestion
behaviour, since the base layer does not involve any overhead. Table 36
shows the average overhead for the two scenarios for two different
assumed SVC overheads. With the assumed SVC overhead of 10% for heavy
congestion it is 6.4% since the base layer is requested more often and
8.6% with light congestion, since the highest quality is requested more
often. With an assumed SVC overhead of 20% the last mile overhead for
the heavy congestion case is 12.7% and the light congestion of 17.2%.

6.2 Stereoscopic 3D Video
-------------------------

### 6.2.1 Enabling Codecs and Formats

#### 6.2.1.1 Introduction

There are 2 major ways of formatting the views of a stereoscopic video:
spatial compression and temporal interleaving. Other formats such color
shifting and 2D+Depth are possible but are either outdated or still
subject to research and development.

Finally, the left and right views may also be encoded as separate views,
possibly exploiting redundancies between the two views to enhance the
compression efficiency. This technique is standardized by MPEG as part
of the H.264/AVC standard.

#### 6.2.1.2 Packing Formats

##### 6.2.1.2.1 Frame Compatible Video

This technique uses spatial compression to pack the two views of the
stereoscopic video into a single frame (thus the name frame compatible).
This allows the usage of deployed encoding and transport infrastructure
and keeping similar bandwidth requirements at the cost of information
loss. The two views are first down-sampled and then packed. The
down-sampling may be performed horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
The packing may use a side-by-side, top-bottom, interleaved, or
checkerboard format. The different alternatives are illustrated in the
following figures.

![](media/image81.wmf){width="4.16875in" height="6.156944444444444in"}

Figure 69: Spatial packing formats

##### 6.2.1.2.2 Temporal Interleaving

In temporal interleaving, the video is encoded at double the frame rate
of the original video. Each pair of subsequent pictures constitutes a
stereo pair (left and right view). The rendering of the time interleaved
stereoscopic video is typically performed at the high frame rate, where
active (shutter) glasses are used to blend the incorrect view at each
eye. This requires accurate synchronization between the glasses and the
screen.

height="2.248611111111111in"}

Figure 70: Temporal interleaving

#### 6.2.1.3 Multi-view Video

MVC \[3\] has recently been standardized for the compression of multiple
view video as an addition to the H.264/AVC standard family. In MVC, the
views from different cameras are encoded into a single bit-stream that
is backwards compatible with single view H.264/AVC. MVC introduces new
coding tools to exhibit the spatial redundancy among the different
views.

MVC is able to efficiently compress stereoscopic video in a backwards
compatible manner and without compromising the view resolutions. The NAL
units from the secondary view are ignored by legacy decoders as the NAL
unit type will not be recognized. If the server is aware of the UE
capabilities, it can omit sending NAL units from the secondary view to a
device that does not support 3D or does not have enough bitrate to
deliver both views.

The following figure depicts a possible prediction chain for a
stereoscopic video.

### 6.2.2 Performance Evaluation

#### 6.2.2.1 Performance Evaluation of the Compression Efficiency

##### 6.2.2.1.1 Simulation Setup

The following formats for stereoscopic 3D video are compared:

\- Side-by-Side frame packing

\- Top-Bottom frame packing

\- Vertical Interleaving frame packing

\- Horizontal Interleaving frame packing

\- Separate Left and Right view encoding

\- Multi-view Video Coding (MVC)

For the different frame packing formats, the left and right views are
sub-sampled to yield a packed frame that has the same resolution as the
original view resolution.

For the AVC encoding of the packed formats, JM \[7\], KTA \[8\], as well
as the Nokia AVC encoder have been used. The open source Nokia MVC \[9\]
encoder has been used to encode the MVC sequences.

The following encoding parameters have been used:

\- No B pictures to maintain compatibility with Baseline profile

\- Fixed QP for I and P pictures: 20-34

\- Reference Frames: 2

\- GOP period: 30 pictures

\- Baseline profile conformance

\- Motion estimation search range: 16

The test sequences that have been used are:

\- Alt Moabit: 432x240, 100 pictures

\- Book Arrival: 432x240, 100 pictures

\- Door Flowers: 432x240, 100 pictures

\- Leaving Laptop: 432x240, 100 pictures

All sequences may be downloaded from the MPEG FTP server.

For the down-sampling, the tool from the JSVM and JMVM reference
software has been used. The tool implements a dyadic down-sampling
filter.

For evaluating the performance, PSNR has been calculated over the
different sequences. For the case of frame packing, the PSNR is
calculated compared to the original frame-packed video sequence. For MVC
and the separate view encoding, the PSNR is calculated for the left and
right views separately and then averaged.

##### 6.2.2.1.2 Performance Evaluation

The following figures depict the Rate-Distortion curves for the
different frame packing and compression configurations and for the
different video sequences.

7 Conclusions
=============

This Technical Report provides a set of use cases for video services in
PSS and MBMS environments. The 2D use cases have been selected in order
to highlight the potentially added value of scalable video coding. The
3D use cases provide initial considerations of video formats and codecs
to be used in order to convey stereoscopic 3D video to a 3D capable
device.

In the MBMS context, scalable video coding is compared to single layer
H.264 AVC as recommended in TS26.346. Specifically, the potential
benefits of SVC have been evaluated when combined with transport layer
features, e.g. unequal error protection modes, layer aware transmission,
in order to provide graceful degradation behaviour at client side.

In the PSS context, the ability to optimize caching and CDN traffic load
has been discussed when SVC is used for adaptive HTTP streaming
services.

Despite potential gains having been shown for selected use cases, some
drawbacks have also been reported regarding the coding efficiency of
SVC. Some concerns were raised on the implementation complexity of SVC,
however this is out of the scope of the TR. More detailed analysis would
be needed in order to evaluate this complexity issue on both the codec
and transport level.

All the SVC performance results are either based on theoretical
simulation models or make use of the SVC reference software. At the time
this report was generated SVC was facing a lack of available commercial
encoding/decoding solutions.

The evaluation tools collected in the TR for SVC may serve as a basis
for more detailed investigations in the future.

There are no changes expected on the 3GPP specifications as a result of
this TR.

Regarding the mobile 3D use cases, different representation formats have
been considered in this study, such as full resolution per view, and
several frame-packing arrangements, such as side-by-side or
top-and-bottom (also called \"frame compatible\") formats. The video
codecs under consideration included H.264 AVC and its 3D extension
called MVC. The performance evaluation highlighted the coding efficiency
of MVC. However, beyond coding efficiency other aspects, such as the
rendering technology need to be taken into account (e.g. parallax
barrier, lenticular network, external display device, etc.).

The first 3D capable mobile devices are expected to be available in the
market in 2011. They will allow further study of the video formats
(codec, bitrate, source representation format) and (most important)
evaluate their associated quality of experience. Backward compatibility
with 2D services and devices may have to be considered. Additional work
in 3GPP is encouraged in this area to identify the potential areas and
interfaces where 3GPP can provide relevant specifications to support 3D
services in the context of 3GPP services. This technical report should
be considered as the basis for such future work on 3D.

######### Annex A: Assumptions for Simulation Method for Solutions on MBMS Services

This Annex A presents assumptions for simulation study for solutions
within MBMS services (i.e. MBSFN). The information in the present
document has been collected with the best knowledge that was available
at the time when the present document was produced and may not
necessarily represent a realistic MBMS deployment. It is up to the
reader of the TR to identify if the parameters in this Annex are
relevant for their use. Note that the packet loss pattern proposed in
this Annex A is time uncorrelated model.

The cell layouts frequently found in performance studies in RAN working
groups are similar as Figure A.1. These layouts are composed of 19 cells
of which each cell consists of 3 sectors. Therefore, total number of
sectors is 57.

Figure A.1 shows 4 cases of MBSFN sector deployments over 57 sectors.
The sectors of MBSFN transmission mode are synchronized in transmission
time, frequency band, modulation and channel coding rate. The effect of
synchronized MBSFN transmission is increased spectral efficiency.
Therefore UEs surrounded by MBSFN cells achieve good signal quality as
the size of MBSFN area becomes large. Other surrounding sectors are all
interference sectors.

In Figure A.1, MBSFN participating sectors are increased from single
sector (1/57 case), 7 sectors which is a formation of a centre sector
surrounded by a ring of MBSFN cooperating sectors (7/57 case), 19
sectors (19/57 case) and 37 sectors (37/57 case).

The performance metric measured in this layout is coverage versus BLER.
The \"coverage\" denotes normalized ratio of measured area to the size
of entire MBSFN area (i.e. total size of MBSFN sectors). Therefore, 50%
coverage in single sector deployment usually means only half area of a
sector size. However, 50% coverage in an area consists of 37 MBSFN
sectors may encompass the area of 7 sectors. The signal strength
degrades gradually from centre of the MBSFN area to the edge because the
interference from surrounding cells is increased. Therefore BLER (Block
Error Rate) is generally increased as the coverage is increased. Figures
in A.1 show scatter graphs of BLER level in different MBSFN layouts and
channels. In the figures, it is illustrated that 64 QAM signal of 10%
loss rate (purple dots) may only cover less than 20% area in single
sector layout, however in 7 sector layout, the coverage of 10% loss rate
increases to 45%, and it becomes 65% in 19 sectors layout, 75% in 37
sectors layout. The red dots\' area is high-loss rate area due to strong
interference. BLER figures of 16QAM and QPSK channel in the case of 19
sector layout are also described.

Two types of cell density models are considered. The urban macro dense
deployment model uses inter-site distance (ISD) 500m, and the sparse
model uses *ISD = 1732m*. The pedestrian mobility speed of UE is limited
to *3km/hr*.

There are 4 combinations of channel modulation and coding schemes (MCS)
tested to generate the BLER trace. Table A.2 summarizes the MCS
settings, information data rates (i.e. channel throughput) available to
application layer and physical block size. Note that a physical block in
LTE channel corresponds to subframe of *1 msec*. Therefore the size of
block may range from *125 bytes/block* to *1125 bytes/block*
respectively to each MCS level. If a block contains corrupted bit, the
block is counted as error.

Only the downlink performance is measured and uplink feedback channel is
not defined in this broadcast channel model.

Figures A.2 to A.6 show the BLER curves of the 4 MCS channels in various
cell layouts. Figure A.2 is the BLER curves in single MBSFN sector
(*ISD=500m*). The graph shows that almost *90%* of the single sector
area can be guaranteed less than *0.1%* of BLER, if MCS-1 channel of
1*Mbps* throughput (i.e. QPSK and 1/6 rate coding) is used for
application. If one wants to increase the channel throughput to 3*Mbps*
(i.e. QPSK and 1/2 rate coding), the coverage drops to 65%. The highest
throughput channel of 9*Mbps* (i.e. 64QAM and 1/2 rate coding) may only
cover 10% area if BLER is less than 0.10%.

Figure A.6: BLER Curves in Different Layouts (9*Mbps* and 3*Mbps*)

The presented results so far within Annex A assumed that the MBSFN area
is equal to the MBMS service reception area. An alternative for the
simulation setup include an increase of the MBSFN area beyond the
intended MBMS service reception area. The MBSFN area can be made equal
to the size of the intended reception area plus one or more ring of
cells.

Figure A.7 shows the simulation setup with an MBSFN area size of 19
cells surrounded by interfering cells. For the moment we assume that the
surrounding cells transmit unicast data. 3 reference circles close to
the border of the MBSFN area are also shown in Figure A.7. Figure A.8
shows the scatter plot of SINR (*dB*-averaged over frequency domain)
from the simulation scenario in Figure A.7. The radius of the 3
reference circles is shown as vertical lines. It can be seen that below
500m distance the mean of the SINR distribution versus the distance is
quite constant. At a distance larger than 500m a strong drop of the SINR
is noted. This strong drop can be avoided if the MBSFN area is extended
beyond the service reception area resulting in a more uniform SINR
within the reception area. In order to get similar simulation results,
locations in the border cells of the MBSFN area may be excluded from the
evaluation of reception locations.

Figure A.8: SINR versus distance from MBSFN center; interfering unicast
cells

In another simulation setting the cells surrounding the considered MBSFN
reception area are assumed to belong to another MBSFN. In this case,
techniques such as interference rejection combining (IRC) in the UE are
more efficient, because the signals from all the cells of the adjacent
MBSFN area coherently aggregate (as long as they arrive within the
cyclic prefix) and thereby the adjacent MBSFN area is seen as one single
large interfering cell. IRC is most efficient in this case of a dominant
single interferer. Figure A.9 shows the SINR results for this scenario.
Compared with Figure A.8 the SINR is significant higher. Therefore, the
assumptions of simulations should distinguish whether the cells outside
of the considered MBSFN area transmit unicast data or belong to another
MBSFN area.

######### Annex B: Impact of Screen Size on Stereoscopic Video 

B.1 Geometry of Stereoscopic Video
==================================

In case of stereoscopic video, two separate images (one for the left eye
and one for the right eye) are provided. Figure B.1 shows the basic
geometry in case of stereoscopic video and how the depth of an object is
perceived.

![](media/image100.png){width="5.704861111111111in"
height="1.9916666666666667in"}

Figure B.1: Geometry of stereoscopic video

Using simple geometry, the following formula using the symbols from
Figure B.1 is derived

![](media/image101.png){width="0.7833333333333333in"
height="0.4409722222222222in"} (***.***B.1)

The formula shows that the perceived depth is inversely proportional to
the separation of the renditions. Scaling the separation (as in the case
of a display size reduction) does not have a linear impact on the depth
at which the object is perceived.

B.2 Depth Range
===============

Figure B.2 shows the perceived depth placement for several objects based
on the separation of the left and right rendition of the objects. Each
object is also labelled with the separation of its left and right
renditions on the screen as a multiple of eye separation. From
(***Eq.*** B.1), it can be noted that an object with rendition
separation ***s=e*** would appear at infinite depth.

Typically, objects in a scene appear in a certain depth range. Placing
objects at the border or outside the depth range will limit the comfort
of the viewing experience.

height="2.290277777777778in"}

Figure B.2: Depth placements of objects and the related left-right
separations (from \[23\])

B.3 Effect of Display Size Changes
==================================

Now, the stereoscopic image pair is displayed on a screen with a reduced
size. Since the screen size scales, the separations of the object
renditions scale, and so the perceived depth of the objects.

Figure B.3 shows the effect on the depth range when the objects are
displayed on a screen half of the size, showing the objects at their
newly labelled positions. One result of this scaling is that objects
that were previously at infinity are moved to a depth of ***2t~2~***
(this is shown as **∞** in Figure B.3), where ***t~2~*** is the viewing
distance from the scaled screen.

height="2.082638888888889in"}

Figure B.3: Scene from Figure B.2, as perceived on a screen of half size
(from \[23\])

As seen from Figure 3 reducing the screen size compresses the depth
range. The perceived depths for the original and half screen sizes are
listed in Table B.1.

It should be noted that due to the reduced screen size the viewing
distance ***t~2~*** is significantly smaller than the viewing distance
***t~1~***.

  Object   Separation   Depth           
                        Original size   Half size

  ∞        e            ∞               2t~2~
  -------- ------------ --------------- -----------

B.4 Discussion
==============

Looking at the results from Figure B.3 and Table B.1 the following
effects are observed when the screen size is reduced:

• All objects seem to move towards the screen.

• Distant objects move closer (e.g. from ∞ to 2t2)

• Depth range is non-linear compressed

• An object travelling with constant speed towards the viewer seems to
change speed (accelerating when approaching screen, slowing down when
moving away from screen)

• Impossible to place objects at infinity distance

• \"Close\" objects move even closer to the viewer (and also to the
screen)

• Objects may move out of stereoscopic comfort zone.

Taken these effects into account, corrections of object separations may
be necessary to improve the perceived depth of stereoscopic video
content, if content that is produced for a larger screen is displayed on
the 3D display of a mobile device. Proposals for such depth correction
can be found in \[23\].

######### Annex C: Real World Statistics of VoD User Request

This annex describes real world statics of VoD service used in the
evaluation of this TR. The statistics have been measured within the time
period of one month. The provided VoD service offers a wide variety of
movies of more than 5000 files among which the users can make their
selection from. In these statistics an average of about 3400 requests
per day is reported. Further statistics on the data are given in Figure
C.1, Figure C.2, Figure C.3, and Table C.1.

Figure C.1 shows the number of requests issued by all users for all
files grouped per hour. A clear diurnal and weekly pattern can be
observed. Day 1, 8, 15, 22 and 29 seem to have the largest peaks and
these days were identified as Saturdays.

Figure C.1: Requests statistics

Figure C.2 shows the average over 30 days of the diurnal pattern. That
is, the evolution over each individual day was cut out of the evolution
shown in Figure C.1 and these 30 curves were averaged. It can be seen
that the peak demand occurs at 8pm.

Figure C.3 shows the popularity evolution for the 10 most popular
multimedia objects. The number of requests for a particular media object
is accumulated over a day (so that diurnal effects cannot be seen). The
weekly patterns can be observed with peaks on the Saturdays and although
not very prominent some multimedia objects expose an aging effect, i.e.,
as time goes by the interest in them decreases.
