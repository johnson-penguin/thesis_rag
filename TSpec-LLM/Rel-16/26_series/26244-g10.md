4 Overview
==========

The 3GPP file format (3GP) is defined in this specification as an
instance of the ISO base media file format \[7\]. 3GP is mandated in
\[8\] to be used for continuous media along the entire delivery chain
envisaged by the MMS, independent of whether the final delivery is done
by streaming or download, thus enhancing interoperability.

In particular, the following stages are considered:

\- upload from the originating terminal to the MMS proxy;

\- file exchange between MMS servers;

\- transfer of the media content to the receiving terminal, either by
file download , by streaming or MBMS download delivery \[40\]. In the
first and last case the self-contained file is transferred, whereas in
the second case, for RTP streaming, the content is extracted from the
file and streamed according to open payload formats. In this case, no
trace of the file format remains in the content that goes on the wire/in
the air. In segmented streaming over DASH \[49\], the file is divided
into segments for transfer.

For the PSS, the 3GPP file format is mandated in \[3\] to be used for
timed text and it should be supported by PSS servers; 3GP files with
streaming-server extensions should be used for storage in streaming
servers and the \"hint track\" mechanism should be used for the
preparation for streaming. For Adaptive HTTP Streaming, HTTP streaming
extensions are defined.

This specification also defines the necessary structure for integration
over several codecs into the ISO base media file format \[7\]. In
particular, this specification defines:

-   the necessary structure for integration of 3GPP defined codecs such
    as AMR, AMR-WB, Enhanced aacPlus and EVS in clauses 6.

-   the necessary structure for integration of H.263 video \[9\] in
    clause 6.6.

5 Conformance
=============

5.1 General
-----------

The 3GPP file format is structurally based on the ISO base media file
format defined in \[7\]. However, the conformance statement for 3GP
files is defined here by addressing constraints and extensions to the
ISO base media file format, registration of codecs, file identification
(file extension, brand identifier and MIME type) and profiles. If a 3GP
file contains codecs or functionalities not conforming to this
specification they may be ignored, i.e. a 3GP compliant file parser may
ignore non-compliant boxes.

5.2 Definition
--------------

### 5.2.1 Limitations to the ISO base media file format

The following limitation to the ISO base media file format \[7\] shall
apply to a 3GP file:

\- compact sample sizes (\'stz2\') shall not be used for tracks
containing H.263, AMR, AMR-WB, AAC or Timed text.

NOTE: The extended presentation format (see clause 11) is defined by
using the Meta box of the ISO base media file format \[7\] that was not
present in the first edition. Hence, extended presentations in 3GP files
are explicitly signalled via the Extended-presentation profile (see
clause 5.4.6).

### 5.2.2 Registration of codecs

Code streams for H.263 video \[9\], H.264 (AVC) video \[29\], H.265
(HEVC) video \[51\], AMR narrow-band speech \[11\], AMR wide-band speech
\[12\], Extended AMR wide-band audio \[21\], EVS \[55\], Enhanced
aacPlus audio \[23, 24, 25\], MPEG-4 AAC audio \[13\], and timed text
\[4\] can be included in 3GP files as described in clause 6 of the
present document.

### 5.2.3 Extensions

The following extensions to the ISO base media file format \[7\] can be
used in a 3GP file:

\- streaming-server extensions (see clause 7);

\- asset information (see clause 8);

\- video-buffer information (see clause 9);

\- AVC file format (see clause 5 of \[20\]), for which the use of sample
entry types other than \'avc1\' is disallowed;

\- MVC file format (see clause 7 of \[20\]);

\- H.265 (HEVC) file format (see clause 8 of \[20\]);

\- RTP and RTCP reception hint tracks (see \[38\]);

\- SRTP and SRTCP reception hint tracks with key management information
for SRTP recordings (see \[38\] and clause 12);

\- Quality metrics timed metadata track (see clause 4 of \[53\] and
clause 16 of this specification).

If SDP information is included in a 3GP file, it shall be used as
defined by the streaming-server extensions.

### 5.2.4 MPEG-4 systems specific elements

For the storage of MPEG-4 media specific information in 3GP files, this
specification refers to MP4 \[14\], the AVC file format as specified in
clause 5 of \[20\], and the H.265 (HEVC) file format as specified in
clause 8 of \[20\], which are also based on the ISO base media file
format. However, tracks relative to MPEG-4 system architectural elements
(e.g. BIFS scene description tracks or OD Object descriptors) are
optional in 3GP files and shall be ignored. The inclusion of MPEG-4
media does not imply the usage of MPEG-4 systems architecture. Terminals
and servers are not required to implement any of the specific MPEG-4
system architectural elements.

### 5.2.5 Template fields

The ISO base media file format \[7\] defines the concept of template
fields that may be used by derived file formats. The template field
\"alternate group\" can be used in 3GP files, as defined in clause 7.2.
No other template fields are used.

### 5.2.6 Interpretation of the 3GPP file format

All index numbers used in the 3GPP file format start with the value one
rather than zero, in particular \"first-chunk\" in Sample to chunk box,
\"sample-number\" in Sync sample box and \"shadowed-sample-number\",
\"sync-sample-number\" in Shadow sync sample box.

5.3 Identification
------------------

### 5.3.1 General

3GP files can be identified using several mechanisms: file extension,
MIME types and brands.

### 5.3.2 File extension

When stored in traditional computer file systems, 3GP files should be
given the file extension \'.3gp\'. Readers should allow mixed case for
the alphabetic characters.

### 5.3.3 MIME types

The MIME types \'video/3gpp\' (for visual or audio/visual content, where
visual includes both video and timed text) and \'audio/3gpp\' (for
purely audio content) shall be used as defined in \[27\].

### 5.3.4 Brands

This specification defines several brand identifiers corresponding to
the profiles defined in clause 5.4. Brands are indicated in a file-type
box, defined in \[7\], which shall be present in conforming files. The
fields of the file-type box shall be used as follows:

**- Brand**: Identifies the \'best use\' of the file and should match
the file extension. For files with extension \'.3gp\' and conforming to
this specification, the brand shall be one of the profile brands defined
in clause 5.4.

**- MinorVersion**: This identifies the minor version of the brand. For
files with brand \'3gLZ\', where L is a letter and Z a digit, and
conforming to version Z.x.y of this specification, this field takes the
value x\*256 + y.

**- CompatibleBrands**: a list of brand identifiers (to the end of the
box). Any profile of a 3GP file is declared by including the
corresponding brand from clause 5.4 in this list.

The brand identifier (of one of the profiles) must occur in the
compatible-brands list, and may also be the primary brand. Conformance
to more than one profile is indicated by listing the corresponding
brands in the compatible-brands list. If the file is also conformant to
earlier releases of this specification, it is recommended that the
corresponding brands (\'3gp4\', \'3gp5\', \'3gp6\', \'3gp7\' and/or
\'3gp8\') also occur in the compatible-brands list. If, for instance,
\'3gp4\' is not in the compatible-brands list, then the file will not be
processed by a Release 4 reader. Readers should check the
compatible-brands list for the identifiers they recognize, and not rely
on the file having a particular primary brand, for maximum
compatibility. Files may be compatible with more than one brand, and
have a \'best use\' other than this specification, yet still be
compatible with this specification.

5.4 Profiles
------------

### 5.4.1 General

All 3GP files of this release shall conform to the general definitions
in clauses 5.1-5.3. Additional profile-specific constraints are listed
below. A 3GP file must conform to at least one profile and may conform
to several profiles.

### 5.4.2 General profile

The 3GP General profile is branded \'3gg9\' and is a superset of all
other profiles. It is used to identify 3GP files conformant to this
specification, although they may not conform to any of the specific
profiles listed below.

NOTE: The General profile of 3GP has fewer restrictions than other
profiles and is suitable for files not yet ready to be delivered by MMS
or to be streamed by a PSS server. A General 3GP file may for instance
contain several alternative tracks of media. After extracting a suitable
set of tracks the file may be ready for MMS and can be re-profiled as a
Basic file. Alternatively, by adding streaming-server extensions, it may
be re-profiled as a Streaming-server profile.

### 5.4.3 Basic profile

The 3GP Basic profile is branded \'3gp9\'.

The following constraints shall apply to a 3GP file conforming to Basic
profile:

\- there shall be no references to external media outside the file, i.e.
a file shall be self-contained;

\- the maximum number of tracks shall be one for video (or alternatively
one for scene description), one for audio and one for text;

\- the maximum number of sample entries shall be one per track for video
and audio (but unrestricted for text and scene description);

\- there shall be no references between tracks, e.g., a scene
description track shall not refer to a media track since all tracks are
on equal footing and played in parallel by a conforming player.

NOTE 1: The Basic profile of 3GP in Release 6 or higher corresponds to
3GP files of earlier releases, which did not define profiles.

NOTE 2: In order to maintain backward compatibility with Release 4 and
Release 5, it is not recommended to use movie fragments in 3GP files for
MMS.

NOTE 3: For H.264 (AVC) or H.265 (HEVC) video in a Basic profile 3GP
file, the restriction on the number of video tracks implies in
particular that there shall be no alternative tracks (including
switching tracks) and no separate tracks for parameter sets.

NOTE 4: For DIMS scene description in a Basic profile 3GP file, the
restriction on the number of scene description tracks implies in
particular that there shall be no separate tracks for redundant DIMS
units.

NOTE 5: The handler types for tracks with video, audio, text and scene
description are \'vide\', \'soun\', \'text\', and \'sdsm\',
respectively.

### 5.4.4 Streaming-server profile

The 3GP Streaming-server profile is branded \'3gs9\' and is used in PSS.
Conformance to this profile will guarantee interoperability between
content creation tools and streaming servers, in particular for the
selection of alternative encodings of content and adaptation during
streaming.

The following constraints shall apply to 3GP files conforming to
Streaming-server profile:

\- RTP hint tracks shall be included for all media tracks;

\- RTP hint tracks shall comply with streaming as specified by PSS
\[3\];

\- SDP information shall be included, as specified in clause 7.5, where
SDP fragments shall be stored in the hint tracks with media-level
control URLs referring to (the same) hint tracks.

\- streaming-server extensions should be used for hint tracks, as
defined in chapter 7.

The following requirements shall apply to servers conforming to this
profile. A conforming server

\- shall understand and respect directions given in the streaming-server
extensions, as defined in chapter 7;

\- should understand hint tracks;

\- may override instructions in hint tracks.

NOTE 1: The instructions given in RTP hint tracks shall be consistent
with the PSS. In particular, sending times of RTP packets shall respect
buffer constraints and be consistent with parameters used in SDP.

NOTE 2: Earlier releases of the 3GPP file format did not define
streaming-server extensions or profiles. The usage of hint tracks was an
internal implementation matter for servers outside the scope of the PSS
specification.

### 5.4.5 Progressive-download profile

The 3GP Progressive-download profile is branded \'3gr9\'. It is used to
label 3GP files that are suitable for progressive download, i.e. a
scenario where a file may be played during download (with some delay).

The following constraints shall apply to 3GP files conforming to
Progressive-download profile:

\- the \'moov\' box shall be placed right after the \'ftyp\' box in the
beginning of the file;

\- all media tracks (if more than one) shall be interleaved with an
interleaving depth of one second or less.

NOTE 1: This profile functions as an aid and not a requirement for
progressive download, which has been an inherent feature of the 3GPP
file format since the first version in Release 4. By parsing a 3GP file,
a client can always determine whether a file can be progressively
downloaded, and then calculate the interleaving depth from the meta-data
in the \'moov\' box.

NOTE 2: The \'interleaving depth of one second or less\' means that:

\- Each chunk contains one or more samples, with the total duration of
the samples being either: no greater than 1 second, or the duration of a
single sample if that sample\'s duration is greater than 1 second;

\- Within a track, chunks must be in decoding time order within the
media-data box \'mdat\';

\- It is recommended that, in \'mdat\', regardless of media type, the
chunks for all tracks are stored in ascending order by decoding time.
However, this order may be perturbed so that, when two chunks from
different tracks overlap in time, the chunk of one track (e.g. audio) is
stored before the chunk of the other track (e.g. video), even if the
first sample in the second track has a slightly earlier timestamp than
the first sample in the first track.

### 5.4.6 Extended-presentation profile

The 3GP Extended-presentation profile is branded \'3ge9\'. It enables a
3GP file to carry any kind of multimedia presentation composed of
tracks, media files and a scene description.

The following constraint shall apply to 3GP files conforming to
Extended-presentation profile:

\- there shall be an extended presentation as defined in clause 11.

The following requirement shall apply to a player conforming to this
profile. A conforming player

\- shall render the content of the 3GP file as prescribed by the
contained scene description (primary item).

NOTE: The scene description can address resources by using URLs as
described in clause 11.3. In particular, it can refer to media in tracks
and items and also to scene description updates in scene description
tracks.

### 5.4.7 Media Stream Recording profile

The 3GP Media Stream Recording Profile is branded \'3gt9\'. It is used
to label 3GP files that contain recordings of multimedia streams, e.g.,
from a PSS or an MBMS session.

The following constraints apply to 3GP files conforming to the Media
Stream Recording Profile:

\- Non-protected media streams may be contained in RTP reception hint
tracks or in media tracks or in both as specified in \[38\]

\- One RTCP hint track per media stream may be contained as specified in
\[38\].

\- Protected media data may be contained in SRTP reception hint tracks
as specified in \[38\].

\- Control information, i.e., SRTCP sender reports, necessary to render
the protected media in SRTP reception hint tracks shall be contained in
one SRTCP reception hint track per SRTP reception hint tracks specified
in \[38\].

\- MIKEY MBMS Traffic Key messages \[39\] necessary to access the
information stored in SRTP and SRTCP reception hint tracks shall be
contained in key message tracks as described in clause 12.2.

\- Key management information necessary to render the content of the 3GP
file shall be contained as described in clause 12.2, provided that at
least one SRTP reception hint track is present.

\- SDP information shall be included as specified in clause 12.3.

The following requirements shall apply to 3GP players conforming to this
profile. A conforming player:

\- shall be able to reconstruct the received media stream from media
tracks and RTP/RTCP hint tracks.

\- shall be able to extract the unprotected content from the 3GP file,
provided that the player has access to required MBMS Service Keys or is
able to obtain these using the methods specified in \[39\].

### 5.4.8 File-delivery server profile

The File-delivery server profile is branded \'3gf9\'. Conformance to
this profile will guarantee interoperability between content creation
tools and file delivery servers.

The following constraints shall apply to 3GP files conforming to
File-delivery server profile:

\- File Delivery Hint Tracks and File Delivery Format Extensions, as
specified in \[7\], shall be used for files intended for transmission
over FLUTE \[42\].

The following requirements shall apply to servers conforming to this
profile.

\- A conforming server shall understand and respect Filed Delivery Hint
Tracks and File Delivery Format Extensions, as specified in \[7\].

### 5.4.9 Adaptive-Streaming profile

The 3GP Adaptive-Streaming profile is branded \'3gh9\'. It is used to
label 3GP files that are primarily suitable for adaptive file-based
streaming.

The following constraints shall apply to 3GP files conforming to
Adaptive-Streaming profile:

\- the \'moov\' box shall be placed in the beginning of the file right
after the \'ftyp\' box and a possibly present \'pdin\' box;

\- all movie data shall be contained in Movie Fragments, i.e. the tracks
in the \'moov\' box shall not contain any samples (i.e. the entry\_count
in the \"stts\", \"stsc\", and \"stco\" boxes shall be set to 0).

\- the \'moov\' box shall contain an \'mvex\' box to indicate the
presence of movie fragments.

\- the \'moov\' box shall be followed by one or more \'moof\' and
optionally \'mdat\' box pairs.

\- each \'moof\' box shall contain at least one track fragment.

\- The \'moof\' boxes shall use movie-fragment relative addressing for
media data that does not use external data references and the flag
\'default-base-is-moof\' shall also be set; absolute byte-offsets shall
not be used for this media data. In a movie fragment, the durations by
which each track extends should be as close to equal as practical. In
particular, as movie fragments are accumulated, the track durations
should remain close to each other and there should be no \'drift\'.

\- For any track, any \'tfad\' or any \'tfdt\' box, if present, shall
duplicate the operations of a possibly present \'elst\' box; when any
\'tfad\' or any \'tfdt\' is used, the \'elst\' box, if present, shall be
ignored.

3GP files conforming to this profile may contain:

\- segment (\'styp\') type boxes as specified in clause 13.2,

\- track fragment adjustment (\'tfad\') boxes as specified in clause
13.3, and

\- segment index (\'sidx\') boxes as specified in clause 13.4,

\- track fragment decode time (\'tfdt\') as specified in clause 13.5.

If the \'meta\' box is present and contains the Media Presentation
Description (MPD as defined in TS 26.234 \[3\]) then the \'meta\' box
shall be contained within the \'moov\' box. In this case the \'meta\'
box shall contain a \'hdlr\' box with handler\_type \'mpd \' followed by
an \'xml \' box containing the MPD.

If the \'meta\' box is present and contains a link to the MPD, then the
\'meta\' box shall be contained within the \'moov\' box. In this case
the \'meta\' box shall contain a \'hdlr\' box with handler\_type
\'mpdl\' followed by a \'dinf\' box. The \'dinf\' box shall contain a
\'dref\' box with exactly one entry, which is a \'url \' box containing
the URL of the MPD.

### 5.4.10 Media Segment Profile

The 3GP Media Segment profile is branded \'3gm9\'. It is used to label
segments conforming to this release. Media Segments are defined in 3GPP
TS 26.247 \[49\].

5.5 File-branding guidelines
----------------------------

The file-type brands defined in this specification are used to label 3GP
files belonging to this release and conforming to one or more profiles.
3GP files may also conform to earlier Releases or even to other file
formats, such as MP4, which is also derived from the ISO base media file
format \[7\].

Table 5.1 contains a non-exhaustive list of examples with 3GP files for
various purposes. Note, however, that it only gives typical or suggested
uses. Both writers and readers of files should exercise care when using
brand identifiers. It is worth repeating the general guidelines here,
remembering that a brand identifies a specification or a conformance
point in a specification; its presence in a file indicates both:

\- that the file conforms to the specification; it includes everything
required by, and nothing contrary to the specification (though there may
be other material);

\- that a reader implementing that specification (possibly only that
specification) is given permission to read and interpret the file.

All 3GP files of Release 5 or later shall contain the compatible brand
\'isom\' indicating that they conform to the ISO base media file format,
unless the reader is required to interpret extensions specific to the
AVC file format as specified in clause 5 of \[20\], for which case the
compatible brand \'avc1\' shall be used instead (see note 2), or
extensions specific to extended presentations (see clause 11), for which
case the compatible brand \'iso2\' shall be used (see note 3). The major
brand shall be included in the compatible brands list as well. If a file
contains more than one (3GPP) brand in the compatible brands list, the
major brand indicates the \"best use\" of the file. For example, a
Release-5 file with audio combined with Timed text is best played by a
Release-5 player, but may also be played by a Release-4 player that does
not support timed text.

NOTE 1: Since movie fragments are not allowed in Release 4 and Release
5, a fragmented 3GP file should not contain \'3gp4\' or \'3gp5\' as
brand or compatible brand. A player that does not support movie
fragments will only be able to play the first fragment of a fragmented
file.

NOTE 2: Consider the brands \'isom\' and \'avc1\'. The first indicates
conformance to the base structure of the ISO base media file format
\[7\]. The second indicates conformance to the structures such as sample
groups \[7\]. A file labelled as \'isom\' and \'avc1\' conformant is
indicating that either these extensions are not present, or if present,
they can be ignored (as an \'isom\' reader will not understand them). If
the writer desires that only readers supporting the extensions read a
file, then the \'isom\' brand would be omitted. These extensions are all
optional (i.e. none are required to be in a file, though if they are, an
\'avc1\'-conformant reader must interpret them), and therefore a file
not using them is still \'avc1\' conformant.

NOTE 3: The second version of the ISO base media file format defines the
brand \'iso2\' that in addition to \'isom\' indicates conformance to
extensions to the first version.

about the MP4AudioSampleEntry box in the MPEG-4 file format \[14\]. The
definitions of the Sample Entry boxes for AMR, AMR-WB, AMR-WB+ and H.263
are given in clauses 6.5 to 6.10. The definition of the Sample Entry box
for EVS is given in clause 6.14. The integration of timed text in a 3GP
file is specified in \[4\], the integration of H.264 (AVC) is specified
in \[20\], the integration of H.265 (HEVC) is specified in clause 8 of
\[20\], the integration of Quality metrics timed metadata track is
specified in clause 4 of \[53\] and clause 16 of this specification and
the integration of DIMS is specified in \[36\] and clauses 5.4.3, 5.4.6
and 11 of the present document. Requirements for integrating video
codecs in the context of the TV Video Profile are documented in TS
26.116 \[56\].

AMR and AMR-WB data is stored in the stream according to the AMR and
AMR-WB storage format for single channel header of Annex E \[15\],
without the AMR magic numbers. The 3GPP file format is the native
storage format for AMR-WB+. The data stream, stored in samples of a 3GP
file, shall be formatted according to clause 8.3 of \[21\]. Each sample
contains one or more AMR-WB+ storage units. The number of storage units
per sample may differ from sample to sample.

For EVS each sample of the media is one speech frame block as specified
in Annex A.2.6.2 of \[55\]. A speech frame block consists of N ToC
entries and N speech frames, where N is the value of channelcount in the
EVSSampleEntry box specified in clause 6.14 of the present document.

6.2 Sample Description box
--------------------------

In an ISO file, Sample Description Box gives detailed information about
the coding type used, and any initialisation information needed for that
coding. The Sample Description Box can be found in the ISO file format
Box Structure Hierarchy shown in figure 6.1.

Figure 6.1: ISO File Format Box Structure Hierarchy

The Sample Description Box can have one or more Sample Entries.

Valid Sample Entries already defined for ISO and MP4 include
MP4AudioSampleEntry and HintSampleEntry. Other Sample Entries shall be
according to the following:

\- AMR, AMR-WB AMRSampleEntry

\- AMR-WB+ AMRWPSampleEntry

\- EVS EVSSampleEntry

\- H.263 H263SampleEntry

\- H.264(AVC) AVCSampleEntry

\- H.265(HEVC) HEVCSampleEntry

\- Timed text TextSampleEntry

\- DIMS DIMSSampleEntry

\- CVO timed metadata CVOSampleEntry

\- Location timed metadata LocationSampleEntry

\- Quality metrics timed metadata QualityMetricsSampleEntry

\- Orientation timed metadata OrientationSampleEntry

The format of SampleEntry and its fields are explained as follows:

**SampleEntry ::= MP4AudioSampleEntry \|\

If one compares the MP4VisualSampleEntry -- H263SampleEntry Box the main
difference is in the replacement of the ESDBox, which is specific to
MPEG-4 systems, with a box suitable for H.263. The **H263SpecificBox**
field structure for H.263 is described in clause 6.8.

6.7 AMRSpecificBox field for AMRSampleEntry box
-----------------------------------------------

The AMRSpecificBox fields for AMR and AMR-WB shall be as defined in
table 6.6. The AMRSpecificBox for the AMRSampleEntry Box shall always be
included if the 3GP file contains AMR or AMR-WB media.

Table 6.6: The AMRSpecificBox fields for AMRSampleEntry

  ----------------- ------------------ --------------------------------------------------------------- ----------
  Field             Type               Details                                                         Value
  BoxHeader.Size    Unsigned int(32)                                                                   
  BoxHeader.Type    Unsigned int(32)                                                                   \'damr\'
  DecSpecificInfo   AMRDecSpecStruc    Structure which holds the AMR and AMR-WB Specific information   
  ----------------- ------------------ --------------------------------------------------------------- ----------

**BoxHeader Size and Type:** indicate the size and type of the AMR
decoder-specific box. The type must be \'damr\'.

**DecSpecificInfo:** the structure where the AMR and AMR-WB stream
specific information resides.

The AMRDecSpecStruc is defined as follows:

*struct* **AMRDecSpecStruc**{\
Unsigned int (32) **vendor**\
Unsigned int (8) **decoder\_version\
** Unsigned int (16) **mode\_set\
** Unsigned int (8) **mode\_change\_period\
** Unsigned int (8) **frames\_per\_sample\
**}

The definitions of AMRDecSpecStruc members are as follows:

**vendor:** four character code of the manufacturer of the codec, e.g.
\'VXYZ\'. The vendor field gives information about the vendor whose
codec is used to create the encoded data. It is an informative field,
which may be used by the decoding end. If a manufacturer already has a
four-character code, it is recommended that it uses the same code in
this field. Else, it is recommended that the manufacturer creates a four
character code which best addresses the manufacturer\'s name. It can be
safely ignored.

**decoder\_version:** version of the vendor\'s decoder which can decode
the encoded stream in the best (i.e. optimal) way. This field is closely
tied to the vendor field. It may give advantage to the vendor which has
optimal encoder-decoder version pairs. The value is set to 0 if decoder
version has no importance for the vendor. It can be safely ignored.

**mode\_set:** the active codec modes. Each bit of the mode\_set
parameter corresponds to one mode. The bit index of the mode is
calculated according to the 4 bit FT field of the AMR or AMR-WB frame
structure. The mode\_set bit structure is as follows:
(B15xxxxxxB8B7xxxxxxB0) where B0 (Least Significant Bit) corresponds to
Mode 0, and B8 corresponds to Mode 8.

The mapping of existing AMR modes to FT is given in table 1.a in \[16\].
A value of 0x81FF means all modes and comfort noise frames are possibly
present in an AMR stream.

The mapping of existing AMR-WB modes to FT is given in Table 1.a in TS
26.201 \[17\]. A value of 0x83FF means all modes and comfort noise
frames are possibly present in an AMR-WB stream.

As an example, if mode\_set = 0000000110010101b, only Modes 0, 2, 4, 7
and 8 are present in the stream.

**mode\_change\_period:** defines a number N, which restricts the mode
changes only at a multiple of N frames. If no restriction is applied,
this value should be set to 0. If mode\_change\_period is not 0, the
following restrictions apply to it according to the frames\_per\_sample
field:

*if (mode\_change\_period \< frames\_per\_sample)*

*frames\_per\_sample = k x (mode\_change\_period)*

*else if (mode\_change\_period \> frames\_per\_sample)*

*mode\_change\_period = k x (frames\_per\_sample)*

*where k : integer \[2, ...\]*

If mode\_change\_period is equal to frames\_per\_sample, then the mode
is the same for all frames inside one sample.

**frames\_per\_sample:** defines the number of frames to be considered
as \'one sample\' inside the 3GP file. This number shall be greater than
0 and less than 16. A value of 1 means each frame is treated as one
sample. A value of 10 means that 10 frames (of duration 20 msec each)
are put together and treated as one sample. It must be noted that, in
this case, one sample duration is 20 (msec/frame) x 10 (frame) = 200
msec. For the last sample of the stream, the number of frames can be
smaller than frames\_per\_sample, if the number of remaining frames is
smaller than frames\_per\_sample.

NOTE1: The \"hinter\", for the creation of the hint tracks, can use the
information given by the AMRDecSpecStruc members.

NOTE2: The following AMR MIME parameters are not relevant to PSS:
{mode\_set, mode\_change\_period, mode\_change\_neighbor}. PSS servers
should not send these parameters in SDP, and PSS clients shall ignore
these parameters if received.

6.8 H263SpecificBox field for H263SampleEntry box
-------------------------------------------------

The H263SpecificBox fields for H. 263 shall be as defined in table 6.7.
The H263SpecificBox for the H263SampleEntry Box shall always be included
if the 3GP file contains H.263 media.

** Unsigned int (8) **H263\_Profile**\
}

The definitions of H263DecSpecStruc members are as follows:

**vendor:** four character code of the manufacturer of the codec, e.g.
\'VXYZ\'. The vendor field gives information about the vendor whose
codec is used to create the encoded data. It is an informative field
which may be used by the decoding end. If a manufacturer already has a
four-character code, it is recommended that it uses the same code in
this field. Else, it is recommended that the manufacturer creates a four
character code which best addresses the manufacturer\'s name. It can be
safely ignored.

**decoder\_version:** version of the vendor\'s decoder which can decode
the encoded stream in the best (i.e. optimal) way. This field is closely
tied to the vendor field. It may give advantage to the vendor which has
optimal encoder-decoder version pairs. . The value is set to 0 if
decoder version has no importance for the vendor. It can be safely
ignored.

**H263\_Level and H263\_Profile:** These two parameters define which
H263 profile and level is used. These parameters are based on the MIME
media type video/H263-2000. The profile and level specifications can be
found in \[9\].

EXAMPLE 1: H.263 Baseline = {H263\_Level = 10, H263\_Profile = 0}

EXAMPLE 2: H.263 Profile 3 @ Level 10 = {H263\_Level = 10 ,
H263\_Profile = 3}

NOTE: The \"hinter\", for the creation of the hint tracks, can use the
information given by the H263DecSpecStruc members.

The BitrateBox field shall be as defined in table 6.8. The BitrateBox
may be included if the 3GP file contains H.263 media.

The BitrateBox is composed of the following fields.

  ---------------------- ------------------------------ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ ----------

If one compares the MP4AudioSampleEntry Box - AMRWPSampleEntry Box the
main difference is in the replacement of the ESDBox, which is specific
to MPEG-4 systems, with a box suitable for AMR-WB+. The
**AMRWPSpecificBox** field structure is described in clause 6.10.

NOTE 1: In order to maintain backward compatibility with Release 4 and
5, the AMRWPSampleEntry should not be used for AMR-WB+ streams that only
contain AMR-WB modes. Such streams should be stored as AMR-WB, i.e. by
using the AMRSampleEntry with box type \'sawb\', defined in clause 6.5,
and the storage format for single channel header of Annex E \[15\],
without the AMR magic numbers. This way file readers of previous
releases will always be able to read AMR-WB streams stored in 3GP files.

NOTE 2: In order to enhance interoperability in Release 6, file readers
capable of parsing tracks with AMR-WB+ should also be capable of parsing
AMR-WB tracks (see note 1).

NOTE 3: The timescale of AMR-WB+ is fixed to 72kHz to accommodate the
internal sampling rate which may vary over time. The sampling rate field
of the AMRWPSampleEntry is therefore not coupled to the timescale, but
contains the recommended playback sampling rate.

6.10 AMRWPSpecificBox field for AMRWPSampleEntry box
----------------------------------------------------

The AMRWPSpecificBox fields for AMR-WB+ shall be as defined in table
6.10. The AMRWPSpecificBox for the AMRWPSampleEntry Box shall always be
included if the 3GP file contains AMR-WB+ media.

  ----------------- ------------------- -------------------------------------------------------- ----------

**BoxHeader Size and Type:** indicate the size and type of the AMR-WB+
decoder-specific box. The type must be \'dawp\'.

**DecSpecificInfo:** the structure where the AMR-WB+ stream specific
information resides.

The AMRWPDecSpecStruc is defined as follows:

*struct* **AMRWPDecSpecStruc**{\
Unsigned int (32) **vendor**\
Unsigned int (8) **decoder\_version\

The definitions of AMRWPDecSpecStruc members are as follows:

**vendor:** four character code of the manufacturer of the codec, e.g.
\'VXYZ\'. The vendor field gives information about the vendor whose
codec is used to create the encoded data. It is an informative field,
which may be used by the decoding end. If a manufacturer already has a
four-character code, it is recommended that it uses the same code in
this field. Else, it is recommended that the manufacturer creates a four

**decoder\_version:** version of the vendor\'s decoder which can decode
the encoded stream in the best (i.e. optimal) way. This field is closely
tied to the vendor field. It may give advantage to the vendor which has
optimal encoder-decoder version pairs. The value is set to 0 if decoder
version has no importance for the vendor. It can be safely ignored.

NOTE: For AMR and AMR-WB the AMRSpecificBox defines the number of frames
that are stored in a sample. For AMR-WB+, however, the AMRWPSpecificBox
does not specify an overall sample structure, as the number of storage
units per sample may differ from sample to sample.

6.11 CVOSampleEntry box
-----------------------

The box type of the CVOSampleEntry Box shall be \'3gvo\'.

The CVOSampleEntry Box is defined as follows:

7 Streaming-server extensions
=============================

7.1 General
-----------

This clause defines extensions to 3GP files to be used by streaming
servers. The extensions enable a PSS server to relate different tracks
and use them for selection and adaptation. In particular, they enable a
PSS server to

\- generate SDP descriptions with alternatives, as specified in
subclauses 5.3.3.3 - 5.3.3.4 of \[3\];

\- select and combine tracks with alternative encodings of media before
a presentation;

\- switch between tracks with alternative encodings during a streaming
session;

\- determine the decoding order, playout timestamp, and size for any ADU
in an RTP payload.

In addition, the streaming server extensions enable a PSS server to

\- use SRTP hint tracks for integrity protection.

The streaming-server extensions are intended to be used with hint
tracks, although they are not limited to be used with hint tracks. Hint
tracks are defined in the ISO base media file format \[7\] and provide
(RTP) packetization instructions for media stored in a file.

NOTE: The present document defines syntax and semantics for
streaming-server extensions in 3GP files. It does not define protocols
for, e.g., how a PSS server signals alternative encodings or switches
between different bitrate encodings. All protocols used by a PSS server
are defined in \[3\].

7.2 Groupings of alternative tracks
-----------------------------------

By default all enabled tracks in a 3GP file are streamed (played)
simultaneously. However, the ISO base media file format \[7\] specifies
that tracks that are alternatives to each other can be grouped into an
alternate group. Tracks in an alternate group that can be used for
switching can be further grouped into a switch group, as defined here.

### 7.2.1 Alternate group

Alternate group is identified by an integer, alternate\_group, in the
Track Header box of each track. If this integer is 0 (default value),
there is no information on possible relations to other tracks. If this
integer is not 0, it should be the same for tracks that contain
alternate data for one another and different for tracks belonging to
different such groups. Only one track within an alternate group should
be streamed or played at any time and must be distinguishable from other
tracks in the group via attributes such as bitrate, codec, language,
packet size etc.

### 7.2.2 Switch group

Switch group is identified by an integer, switch\_group, in the Track
Selection box of each track, as defined below. If this box is absent or
if this integer is 0 (default value), there is no information on whether
the track can be used for switching during streaming or playing. If this
integer is not 0, it shall be the same for tracks that can be used for
switching between each other. Tracks that belong to the same switch
group shall belong to the same alternate group.

7.3 Track Selection box
-----------------------

This subclause defines an optional box that aids the selection between
tracks. It is used to encode switch groups and the criteria that should
be used to differentiate tracks within alternate and switch groups.

The Track Selection box is defined in table 7.1. It is contained in the
User data box of the track it modifies.

Note that Track Selection box is also defined in \[7\], with a slightly
different set of defined attributes. One difference is that herein the
definition of the attribute \"Language\" identified by \'lang\' is
included; while in \[7\] the definition of the attribute \"Media
language\" identified by \'mela\' is included.

Table 7.1: Track Selection box fields

  ----------------------- ------------------------ --------------------------------------------- -------------
  Field                   Type                     Details                                       Value
  **BoxHeader**.Size      Unsigned int(32)                                                       
  **BoxHeader**.Type      Unsigned int(32)                                                       \'tsel\'
  **BoxHeader**.Version   Unsigned int(8)                                                        0
  **BoxHeader**.Flags     Bit(24)                                                                0
  SwitchGroup             int(32)                  Switch group of track.                        0 (default)
  AttributeList           Unsigned int(32) \[N\]   List of N attributes to the end of the box.   
  ----------------------- ------------------------ --------------------------------------------- -------------

**BoxHeader Size, Type, Version and Flags:** indicate the size, type,
version and flags of the Track Selection box. The type shall be \'tsel\'
and the version shall be 0. No flags are defined.

**SwitchGroup:** indicates switch group as defined in clause 7.2.2. It
shall be 0 if the track is not intended for switching.

**AttributeList:** is a list of attributes to the end of the box. The
attributes in this list should be used as differentiation criteria for
tracks in the same alternate or switch group. Each attribute is
associated with a pointer to the field or information that distinguishes
the track. Attributes and pointers are listed in table 7.2.

Table 7.2: Attributes for AttributeList of the Track Selection box

  ----------------- ----------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Name              Attribute   Pointer
  Language          \'lang\'    Value of grouping type LANG of \"alt-group\" attribute in session-level SDP (defined in clause 5.3.3.4 of \[3\])
  Bandwidth         \'bwas\'    Value of \"b=AS\" attribute in media-level SDP
  Codec             \'cdec\'    SampleEntry (in Sample Description box of media track)
  Screen size       \'scsz\'    Width and height fields of MP4VisualSampleEntry and H263SampleEntry (in media track)
  Max packet size   \'mpsz\'    Maxpacketsize field in RTPHintSampleEntry
  Media type        \'mtyp\'    Handlertype in Handler box (of media track)
  ----------------- ----------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

7.4 Combining alternative tracks
--------------------------------

Tracks from different alternate groups are streamed (played)
simultaneously. However, all combinations of tracks may not form
suitable presentations. In order to suggest suitable combinations of
tracks and also to reduce the number of possible combinations, a content
provider can encode preferred combinations of alternative tracks in a
3GP file. Such combinations are encoded by the \"alt-group\" attribute
in the session-level SDP fragment, as described in clause 7.5.3.

If information on suitable combinations of tracks is missing, tracks
with the lowest track IDs of each alternate group should be streamed
(played) by default.

7.5 SDP
-------

### 7.5.1 Session- and media-level SDP

Fragments that together constitute an SDP description shall be contained
in a 3GP file with streaming-server extensions. Session-level SDP, i.e.
all lines before the first media-specific line (\"m=\" line), shall be
stored as Movie SDP information within the User Data box, as specified
in \[7\]. Media-level SDP, i.e. an \"m=\" line and the lines before the
next \"m=\" line (or end of SDP) shall be stored as Track SDP
information within the User data box of the corresponding track.
Media-level SDP shall be contained in hint tracks (if provided).

### 7.5.2 Stored versus generated SDP fields

The SDP information stored in a 3GP file should be as complete as
possible, although some fields must be generated or modified by the
server when a presentation is composed. Table 7.3 gives an overview of
the SDP fields used by PSS, c.f. Table A.1 in \[3\], and whether they
are required to be included in 3GP files or whether the server is
required to generate them.

### 7.5.3 SDP attributes for alternatives

Clauses 5.3.3.3 and 5.3.3.4 of \[3\] define SDP attributes that a server
can use for presenting options to a client. These attributes can be used
to encode suggested groupings of tracks, e.g. for selecting a certain
language or target bitrate.

Suggested groupings of tracks from different alternate groups, i.e.
groupings of tracks that should be streamed together, are encoded by
using the \"alt-group\" attribute in the session-level SDP. Note that a
server may have to prune options from such groupings if certain tracks
are not presented to the client.

Media-level SDP fragments shall not contain alternative-media attributes
(\"alt\" and \"alt-default-id\") as they are difficult to pre-encode.
When the server combines several media-level SDP fragments from
alternative tracks into one media-level SDP, it must generate the
appropriate \"alt\" and \"alt-default-id\" attributes. This can be done
by using the information provided in the \"alt-group\" attributes in the
session-level SDP.

NOTE 1: Track IDs given by the Track Header boxes shall be used for
alternative IDs (\"alt-id\") in attributes for SDP alternatives.

NOTE 2: Tracks with the lowest track IDs of each alternate group should
be used as default tracks, i.e. used with the \"alt-default-id\"
attributes.

7.6 SRTP
--------

Hinted content may require the use of SRTP \[19\] for streaming, e.g.
for integrity protection, by using the hint-track format for SRTP
defined here. It consists of a dedicated sample entry, which will be
ignored by 3GP servers not capable of handling SRTP.

SRTP hint tracks are formatted identically to RTP hint tracks defined in
\[7\], except that:

\- the sample entry name is changed from \'rtp \' to \'srtp\' to
indicate to the server that SRTP is required;

\- an extra box is added to the sample entry which can be used to
instruct the server in the nature of the on-the-fly encryption and
integrity protection that must be applied.

Samples of an SRTP hint track follow the same syntax for constructing
RTP packets as RTP hint tracks.

An SRTP Hint Sample Entry (\'srtp\') shall include an SRTP Process Box
(\'srpp\') that may instruct the server as to which SRTP algorithms
should be applied. It is defined in \[7\] and included in Table 7.4 for
information.

  **SchemeInformationBox**                      Box containing the scheme information.   
  -------------------------- ------------------ ---------------------------------------- ----------

The **SchemeTypeBox** and **SchemeInformationBox** have the syntax
defined in Tables 10.7 and 10.8, respectively. They serve to provide the
parameters required for applying SRTP. The Scheme Type Box is used to
indicate the necessary key management and security policy for the stream
in extension to the defined algorithmic pointers provided by the SRTP
Process Box. The key management functionality is also used to establish
all the necessary SRTP parameters. The key management functionality is
also used to establish all the necessary SRTP parameters as listed in
section 8.2 of \[19\]. The exact definition of protection schemes is out
of the scope of the file format.

The algorithms for encryption and integrity protection are defined by
SRTP. Table 7.5 summarizes the format identifiers defined here. An entry
of four spaces (\$20\$20\$20\$20) may be used to indicate that a process
outside the file format decides the choice of algorithm for either
encryption or integrity protection.

7.7 Aggregated RTP payloads
---------------------------

An application data unit (ADU), normally being the smallest
independently usable data unit, is specified as follows for coding
formats and RTP payload formats allowed in 3GP files:

\- For audio and speech, an ADU is specified as a coded frame intended
for transport.

\- For H.263 an ADU consists of an entire RTP payload.

\- For H.264 (AVC) or H.265 (HEVC), an ADU is a Network Adaptation Layer
Unit (NALU).

\- For timed text, an ADU consists of any of the type 1-5 RTP payload
units \[28\].

For encrypted RTP payloads, the actual ADUs are hidden within the
encrypted payload. Some RTP payload formats allow aggregation of
multiple ADUs into a single RTP payload. When any hint sample in an RTP
hint track defines a payload including multiple ADUs, each hint sample
in the hint track shall comply with the following requirements:

\- The extra-flag in the RTPPacket class of the hint sample shall be set
to 1. This indicates that there is extra information before the RTP
constructors in the form of type-length-value sets.

\- The extra information in the hint sample shall include a \'3gau\'
structure as specified below.

class 3gppApplicationDataUnitInfoTLV extends Box(\'3gau\') {\
unsigned int(16) entrycount;\
for(i=1; i\<=entrycount; i++){\
unsigned int(32) numbytes;\
unsigned int(64) decorder;\
unsigned int(32) timestampoffset\
}\
}

**entrycount** indicates the number of ADUs in the RTP payload.

**numbytes** indicates the number of bytes of the i\'th ADU in the RTP
payload.

**decorder** indicates the decoding order of ADUs within the RTP hint
track. The smaller value of decorder, the earlier the ADU is in decoding
order. All ADUs shall have a unique value of decorder, and the
assignment shall be done using consecutive numbers. If two or more ADUs
can be decoded virtually simultaneously, i.e. their relative decoding
order is undefined, they shall still be assigned consecutive numbers.

**timestampoffset** indicates the RTP timestamp offset of the i\'th ADU
relative to the timestamp of RTP header of the packet it will be
transmitted in. Where the ADU\'s timestamp value is equal to what it

8 Asset information
===================

8.1 General
-----------

Asset information in a 3GP file describes the contained media. Clause
8.2 defines 3GPP asset meta data that is backward compatible with
Release 6. However, in order to provide more enriched information for
audio, it is also possible to include ID3 version 2 (ID3v2) tags as
described in clause 8.3.

8.2 3GPP asset meta data
------------------------

A user-data box (\'udta\'), as defined in \[7\] may be present in
conforming files. It should reside within the Movie box, but may reside
within the Track box, following the hierarchy of boxes described in
Clause 6.2.

Within the user-data box, there may reside sub-boxes that contain asset
meta-data, taken from the list of boxes in tables 8.1 through 8.10 below
(zero or more sub-boxes of each kind, zero or one for each language or
role of location information). Each of the sub-boxes conforms to the
definition of a \"full box\" as specified in \[7\] (hence the
\'Version\' and \'Flags\' fields).

The following sub-boxes are in use for the following purposes:

\- titl -- title for the media (see table 8.1)

\- dscp -- caption or description for the media (see table 8.2)

\- cprt -- notice about organisation holding copyright for the media
file (see table 8.3)

\- perf -- performer or artist (see table 8.4)

\- auth -- author of the media (see table 8.5)

\- gnre -- genre (category and style) of the media (see table 8.6)

\- rtng -- media rating (see table 8.7)

\- clsf -- classification of the media (see table 8.8)

\- kywd -- media keywords (see table 8.9)

\- loci -- location information (see table 8.10)

\- albm -- album title and track number for the media (see table 8.11)

\- yrrc -- recording year for the media (see table 8.12)

\- coll -- name of the collection from which the media comes (see table
8.12a)

\- urat -- user \'star\' rating of the media (see table 8.12b)

\- thmb --- thumbnail image of the media (see table 8.12c)

\- orie -- orientation information (see table 8.12d)

NOTE 1: If the location information refers to a time-variant location,
\'Name\' should express a high-level location, such as \"Finland\" for
several places in Finland or \"Finland-Sweden\" for several places in
Finland and Sweden. Further details on time-variant locations can be
provided as \'Additional notes\'.

NOTE 2: The values of longitude, latitude and altitude provide cursory
Global Positioning System (GPS) information of the media content.

NOTE 3: A value of longitude (latitude) that is less than --180 (-90) or
greater than 180 (90) indicates that the GPS coordinates (longitude,
latitude, altitude) are unspecified, i.e. none of the given values for
longitude, latitude or altitude are valid.

  ----------------------- ------------------ ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------

**Digital zoom:** fixed-point 8.8 number indicating the enlargement
scale factor of the image due to cropping and interpolating the pixel
dimensions back to the original size.

**Optical zoom:** fixed-point 8.8 number indicating the optical
magnification scale factor.

**Pan\_indication:** When the value is 1 indicates whether the direction
is \"true\"; when the value is 0 indicates whether the direction is
\"magnetic\".

**Pan:** fixed-point 16.15 number indicating the compass direction of
the component in the plane parallel to the earth\'s surface of any
vector which points in the same direction that the camera is facing.
North corresponds to 0 degrees, East corresponds to 90 degrees; West
correspond to -90 degrees, South corresponds to 180 degrees.If the
camera is pointing in a direction perpendicular to the earth\'s surface
(either straight up at the sky or straight down at the ground), then the
value of Pan is undefined.

**Rotation:** fixed-point 16.16 number in degrees indicating the
rotational position around the axis corresponding to the direction that
the camera is facing. Since Tilt and Rotation are independent
parameters, Rotation is defined for a Tilt value of 0, i.e. the camera
is first tilted to be pointing parallel to the earth\'s surface in the
direction that would correspond to Pan. Rotation is then the amount of
counter-clockwise rotation about the axis that the camera is facing
needed to bring a vector initially pointing straight up towards the sky
into alignment with the camera \"up\" direction. In the event that Pan
is undefined as the camera is either pointing straight up or straight
down, Rotation can be defined as the amount of rotation needed to bring
a vector initially pointing North into alignment with the camera \"up\"
direction.

NOTE: The Rotation and CVO convey the same information.

**Tilt:** fixed-point 16.16 number in degrees indicating the rotational
position around the axis in the plane of constant altitude through the
camera centre that is perpendicular to the Pan direction.When the camera
is pointing parallel to the earth\'s surface, Tilt is 0. When the camera
is pointing straight up towards the sky, the Tilt is 90 degrees and if
the camera is pointing straight down towards the earth Tilt is -90
degrees.

8.3 ID3 version 2 meta data
---------------------------

ID3 version 2 meta-data can be stored in 3GP files by using the Meta box
defined by the ISO base media file format \[7\]. The procedure is
specified by MP4REG, the MP4 Registration Authority \[32\] and is
provided here for information.

The ID3v2 meta data is stored in the Meta box (\'meta\'), which shall
contain a Handler box with handler \'ID32\'. The actual meta data is
either stored in one or more ID3v2 box(es) inside the meta-data box, or
this entire set of box(es) is referenced as the primary item, and stored
elsewhere. The ID3v2 box is defined in Table 8.13.

**Language**: declares the language code for the following text. See ISO
639-2/T for the set of three character codes. Each character is packed
as the difference between its ASCII value and 0x60. The code is confined
to being three lower-case letters, so these values are strictly
positive. If there are some language fields inside ID3 tag, language
must not conflict with them. Instead codes \'mul\' (multiple languages)
and \'und\' (undetermined language) should be used in such cases.

**ID3v2data**: binary data that corresponds to ID3v2 tag format (e.g.
for v.2.4.0: <http://www.id3.org/id3v2.4.0-structure.txt>) and its
native frames (e.g. for v.2.4.0:
<http://www.id3.org/id3v2.4.0-frames.txt>). ID3 tag must not contain any
footer information, because it is never needed. Both ID3v2 tag format
and its native frames must use the same version of the specification.
Size of this field can be derived from the box size. The version of the
ID3 data may be found by inspecting it

The ID3v2 box contains a complete ID3 version 2.x.x data. It should be
parsed according to ID3v2 \[33\] specifications for v.2.x.x tags. There
may be multiple ID3v2 boxes using different language codes.

9 Video buffer information
==========================

9.1 General
-----------

A 3GP file can include video-buffer parameters associated with video
streams. For the case when only one set of parameters is associated to
an entire video stream, these can be included in the corresponding
media-level SDP fragment. However, in order to provide buffer parameters
for different operation points, as defined below, and for different
synchronization points, a track can contain a video buffer sample
grouping. The type of sample grouping depends on which video-buffer
model that is used for a particular video codec.

For H.264 (AVC) or H.265 (HEVC), there are two types of buffers:

\- Hypothetical Reference Decoder (HRD) model;

\- For H.264 (AVC) the de-interleaving buffer of the interleaved RTP
packetization mode as specified in \[30\], or for H.265 (HEVC), the
de-packetization buffer as specified in \[52\].

Buffer parameters for several operation points and synchronization
points of the HRD model may be specified by a video HRD sample grouping
as defined in clause 9.2.2.

Only one set of de-interleaving parameters for H.264 (AVC) and only one
set of de-packetization parameters for H.265 (HEVC) can be associated to
a stream and therefore the de-interleaving or de-packetization
parameters are included in the corresponding media-level SDP fragment
according to the H.264 (AVC) MIME/SDP specification in \[30\] or the
H.265 (HEVC) MIME/SDP specification in \[52\].

NOTE: Any HRD parameters in parameter sets and SEI message in the
bitstream or included in the MIME/SDP parameters of a media-level SDP
fragment must not contradict each other or the information in the video
HRD sample grouping, if any.

9.2 Sample groupings for video-buffer parameters
------------------------------------------------

A sample grouping is an assignment of each sample in a track to be a
member of one (or none) of several sample groups, based on a grouping
criterion. The assignment of buffer parameters to synchronization points
(sync samples) provides one sample grouping of the samples in a track.
The usage of sample groups in 3GP files shall follow the syntax defined
in \[7\].

Each sample is associated to zero or one sample group entries of any
given grouping type in the sample group description box (\'sgpd\').
Sample group entries for sample groups defined by the grouping type
\'3gag\' are given by the 3GPP PSS Annex G Sample group entry, defined
in Table 9.1, and sample group entries for sample groups defined by the
grouping type \'avcb\' are given by the video HRD Sample group entry,
defined in Table 9.2.

Sample group entries provide buffer parameters relevant to all samples
in the corresponding sample group(s). A sync sample and all following
non-sync samples before the next sync sample shall be members of the
same sample group with respect to the video-buffer grouping type. The
indicated buffer parameters for a sync sample are applicable for the
stream from that sync sample onwards.

NOTE: A file, in which some but not all samples are associated with
sample groups with respect to the grouping type \'3gag\' or \'avcb\',
may have been edited and may therefore no longer conform to
corresponding buffer model.

### 9.2.1 3GPP PSS Annex G sample grouping

The grouping type \'3gag\' defines the grouping criterion for 3GPP PSS
Annex G buffer parameters. Zero or one sample-to-group box (\'sbgp\')
for the grouping type \'3gag\' can be contained in the sample table box
(\'stbl\') of a track. It shall reside in a hint track, if a hint track
is used, otherwise in the video track. The presence of this box and
grouping type indicates that the associated video stream complies with
PSS Annex G. Note that the nature of the track defines the media
transport for which the buffer parameters are calculated, e.g. for an
RTP hint track, the media transport is RTP.

  BufferParameters   AnnexGstruc   Structure which holds the buffer parameters of PSS Annex G   
  ------------------ ------------- ------------------------------------------------------------ -------

**BufferParameters**: the structure where the PSS Annex G buffer
parameters reside.

AnnexGstruc is defined as follows:

*struct* **AnnexGstruc**{\
Unsigned int(16) **operation\_point\_count\
** for (i = 0; i \< operation\_point\_count; i++){\
Unsigned int (32) **tx\_byte\_rate\
** Unsigned int (32) **dec\_byte\_rate\
** Unsigned int (32) **pre\_dec\_buf\_size**\
Unsigned int (32) **init\_pre\_dec\_buf\_period\
** Unsigned int (32) **init\_post\_dec\_buf\_period\
** }\
}

The definitions of the AnnexGstruc members are as follows:

**operation\_point\_count:** specifies the number of operation points,
each characterized by a pair of transmission byte rate and decoding byte
rate. Values of buffering parameters are specified separately for each
operation point. The value of operation\_point\_count shall be greater
than 0.

**tx\_byte\_rate:** indicates the transmission byte rate (in bytes per
second) that is used to calculate the transmission timestamps of
media-transport packets for the PSS Annex G buffering verifier as
follows. Let t1 be the transmission time of the previous media-transport
packet and size1 be the number of bytes in the payload of the previous
media-transport packet in transmission order, excluding the
media-transport payload header and any lower-layer headers. For the
first media-transport packet of the stream, t1 and size1 are equal to 0.
The media track shall comply with PSS Annex G when each sample is
packetized in one media-transport packet, the transmission order of
media-transport packets is the same as their decoding order, and the
transmission time of an media-transport packet is equal to t1 + size1 /
tx\_byte\_rate. The value of tx\_byte\_rate shall be greater than 0.

**dec\_byte\_rate:** indicates the peak decoding byte rate that was used
in this operation point to verify the compatibility of the stream with
PSS Annex G. Values are given in bytes per second. The value of
dec\_byte\_rate shall be greater than 0.

**pre\_dec\_buf\_size:** indicates the size of the PSS Annex G
hypothetical pre-decoder buffer in bytes that guarantees pauseless
playback of the entire stream under the assumptions of PSS Annex G.

**init\_pre\_dec\_buf\_period:** indicates the required initial
pre-decoder buffering period that guarantees pauseless playback of the
entire stream under the assumptions of PSS Annex G. Values are
interpreted as clock ticks of a 90-kHz block. That is, the value is
incremented by one for each 1/90 000 seconds. For example, value 180 000
corresponds to a two second initial pre-decoder buffering.

**init\_post\_dec\_buf\_period:** indicates the required initial
post-decoder buffering period that guarantees pauseless playback of the
entire stream under the assumptions of PSS Annex G. Values are
interpreted as clock ticks of a 90-kHz clock.

### 9.2.2 Video HRD sample grouping

The grouping type \'avcb\' defines the grouping criterion for video HRD
parameters. Zero or one sample-to-group box (\'sbgp\') for the grouping
type \'avcb\' can be contained in the sample table box (\'stbl\') of a
track. It shall reside either in a hint track or a video track for H.264
(AVC) or H.265 (HEVC). The presence of this box and grouping type
indicates that the associated video stream complies with the HRD with
the indicated parameters.

Table 9.2: Video HRD sample group entry

  ------------------ ------------- ------------------------------------------------ -------
  Field              Type          Details                                          Value
  AVCHRDParameters   AVCHRDstruc   Structure which holds the video HRD parameters   
  ------------------ ------------- ------------------------------------------------ -------

**AVCHRDParameters**: the structure where the video HRD parameters
reside.

AVCHRDstruc is defined as follows:

*struct* **AVCHRDstruc**{\
Unsigned int(16) **operation\_point\_count\
** for (i = 0; i \< operation\_point\_count; i++){\
Unsigned int (32) **tx\_byte\_rate\
** Unsigned int (32) **pre\_dec\_buf\_size\
** Unsigned int (32) **post\_dec\_buf\_size**\
Unsigned int (32) **init\_pre\_dec\_buf\_period\
** Unsigned int (32) **init\_post\_dec\_buf\_period\
** }\
}

The definitions of the AVCHRDstruc members are as follows:

**operation\_point\_count**: specifies the number of operation points.
Values of the HRD parameters are specified separately for each operation
point. The value of operation\_point\_count shall be greater than 0.

**tx\_byte\_rate**: indicates the input byte rate (in bytes per second)
to the coded picture buffer (CPB) of the HRD.

For H.264 (AVC), the bitstream is constrained by the value of BitRate
equal to 8 \* the value of tx\_byte\_rate for NAL HRD parameters as
specified in \[29\]. For VCL HRD parameters, the value of BitRate is

For H.265 (HEVC), the bitstream is constrained such that, for the NAL
HRD parameters, the value of BitRate\[ i \] for at least one value of i
in the range of 0 to cpb\_cnt\_minus1\[ HighestTid \], inclusive, as
specified in \[51\], is less than or equal to 8 \* tx\_byte\_rate, and
for the VCL HRD parameters, the value of BitRate\[ i \] for at least one
value of i in the range of 0 to cpb\_cnt\_minus1\[ HighestTid \], is
less than or equal to tx\_byte\_rate \* 80 / 11.

**pre\_dec\_buf\_size**: gives the required size of the pre-decoder
buffer or coded picture buffer in bytes.

For H.264 (AVC), the bitstream is constrained by the value of CpbSize
equal to pre\_dec\_buf\_size \* 8 for NAL HRD parameters as specified in
\[29\]. For VCL HRD parameters, the value of CpbSize is equal to
pre\_dec\_buf\_size \* 40 / 6.

For H.265 (HEVC), the bitstream is constrained such that, for the NAL
HRD parameters, the value of CpbSize\[ i \] for at least one value of i
in the range of 0 to cpb\_cnt\_minus1\[ HighestTid \], inclusive, as
specified in \[51\], is less than or equal to pre\_dec\_buf\_size \* 8,
and for the VCL HRD parameters, the value of CpbSize\[ i \] for at least
one value of i in the range of 0 to cpb\_cnt\_minus1\[ HighestTid \], is
less than or equal to pre\_dec\_buf\_size \* 80 / 11.

At least one pair of values of tx\_byte\_rate and pre\_dec\_buf\_size of
the same operation point shall conform to the maximum bitrate and CPB
size allowed by profile and level of the stream.

**post\_dec\_buf\_size**: gives the required size of the post-decoder

) / ( PicWidthMbs \* FrameHeightInMbs \* 256 \* ChromaFormatFactor ) ) )
as specified in \[29\]. If the SDP attribute 3gpp-videopostdecbufsize is
not present for an H.264 (AVC) stream, the value of
max\_dec\_frame\_buffering is inferred as specified in \[29\].

For H.265 (HEVC) Main profile, the bitstream is constrained such that
the value of sps\_max\_dec\_pic\_buffering\_minus1\[ HighestTid \] + 1
as specified in \[51\] is less than or equal to Floor(
post\_dec\_buf\_size / ( PicSizeInSamplesY \* 3 / 2 ) ), where
PicSizeInSamplesY is as specified in \[51\].

**init\_pre\_dec\_buf\_period**: gives the required delay between the
time of arrival in the pre-decoder buffer of the first bit of the first
access unit and the time of removal from the pre-decoder buffer of the
first access unit. It is in units of a 90 kHz clock.

For H.264 (AVC), the bitstream is constrained by the value of the
nominal removal time of the first access unit from the coded picture
buffer (CPB), *t*~r,n~( *0 *), equal to init\_pre\_dec\_buf\_period as
specified in \[29\].

For H.265 (HEVC), the bitstream is constrained such that the value of
the nominal removal time of the first access unit from the coded picture
buffer (CPB), *AuNominalRemovalTime\[* *0 \]*, as specified in \[51\] is
equal to init\_pre\_dec\_buf\_period.

**init\_post\_dec\_buf\_period**: gives the required delay between the
time of arrival in the post-decoder buffer of the first decoded picture
and the time of output from the post-decoder buffer of the first decoded
picture. It is in units of a 90 kHz clock.

For H.264 (AVC), the bitstream is constrained by the value of
dpb\_output\_delay for the first decoded picture in output order equal
to init\_post\_dec\_buf\_period as specified in \[29\] assuming that the
clock tick variable, *t*~c~, is equal to 1 / 90 000.

For H.265 (HEVC), the bitstream is constrained such that the value of
pic\_dpb\_output\_delay for the first decoded picture in output order,
*as specifeid in \[51\], is* equal to init\_post\_dec\_buf\_period,
assuming that the clock tick, *ClockTick,* is equal to 1 / 90 000.

9a Stereoscopic 3D video
========================

9a.1 General
------------

Stereoscopic 3D video can be encapsulated and delivered in 3GP files (or
3GP segments in the case of DASH). Frame compatible H.264/AVC and
temporally interleaved H.264/AVC use the AVC file format as specified in
clause 5 of \[20\] where information about the stereo arrangement is
carried in an SEI message \"frame packing arrangement SEI\". Multiview
Video Coding (MVC) on the other hand uses the MVC file format as
specified in clause 7 of \[20\] which specify separate signalling for
MVC streams.

Storing frame compatible or temporally interleaved stereoscopic 3D video
in a 3GP file as described above ensures that a UE can decode the
bitstreams correctly (if it has the corresponding decoding capability),
but it does not ensure that a UE renders the 3D video correctly. For
instance, a UE that is not aware of the SEI message indicating that a
bitstream represents frame compatible 3D or temporally interleaved 3D
will simply render the video frames as consecutive 2D frames. The output
will most likely look like garbage or with disturbing artefacts to the
viewer.

The above problem is avoided by enforcing post-decoder requirements with
the restricted video mechanism specified in the ISO base media file
format \[7\]. The mechanism is similar to the content protection
transformation where sample entries are hidden behind generic sample
entries, \'encv\', \'enca\', etc., indicating encrypted or encapsulated
media. The analogous mechanism for restricted video uses a
transformation with the generic sample entry \'resv\'. The method should
be applied when the content should only be decoded by clients that
present it correctly. For the above cases with frame compatible and
temporally interleaved 3D video, the scheme type for stereoscopic video
\'stvi\' \[7\] should be used.

In addition, UEs consuming content provided in the 3GP file format
expect to identify the content based on the MIME Type of the 3GP file in
order to accept or reject content. RFC6381 \[34\] provides an ability to
signal profile and codec parameters and may be considered to be used in
this context as well. For more details refer to clause 9a.5.

The following sub-clauses describe stereoscopic 3D file format
signalling in more detail including the case of mixed services.

9a.2 Frame compatible H.264/AVC
-------------------------------

Frame compatible H.264/AVC is stored in a 3GP file as defined for
H.264/AVC in the AVC file format as specified in clause 5 of \[20\]
where the AVC sample entry has been transformed according to the
restricted video mechanism using the sample entry \'resv\' and the
stereo video scheme type \'stvi\' \[7\]. The stereo scheme of the stereo
video box is 1, i.e. the stereo indication type identifies the frame
packing arrangement type by using the values defined by the frame
packing arrangement SEI (Table D-8 of ISO/IEC 14496-10), for example 3
for Side by Side or 5 for temporal interleaved.

NOTE: It is recommended to use the \"frame packing arrangement SEI\"
rather than the \"stereo video SEI\".

9a.3 Multiview Video Coding MVC
-------------------------------

Multiview Video Coding MVC is stored and signalled in a 3GP file as
defined for MVC in the MVC file format as specified in clause 7 of
\[20\]. In order to ensure compatibility with H.264 (AVC) file readers,
at least one track shall use the sample entry type \'avc1\'.

9a.4 Mixed 2D/3D video
----------------------

Decoding and rendering requirements are signalled in the sample entry
descriptions as detailed above. In fact, each video sample in a 3GP file
is associated with a sample entry description, which in turn specifies
if the video data is 2D H,264/AVC or any of the above types of 3D
H.264/AVC. If a file contains both 2D and 3D video, separate sample
entry descriptions are used where 2D parts of the file are associated
with the 2D sample entry description and 3D parts of the file with the
appropriate 3D sample entry description.

9a.5 MIME type signaling for 3D stereoscopic video files
--------------------------------------------------------

UEs consuming content provided in the 3GP file format expect to identify
the content based on the MIME Type of the 3GP file in order to accept or
reject content. RFC6381 \[34\] provides an ability to signal profile and
codec parameters and may be considered to may be used in this context as
well.

To signal content provided in MVC, the codecs parameter as defined in
RFC6381 \[34\] may be used. The details on how to signal MVC content are
provided in RFC6381 \[34\], clause 3.3. The clause addresses also the
use case when MVC content is coded in an H.264/AVC-compatible fashion.

In case of mixed content, all required capabilities may be signalled in
the MIME type parameters.

10 Encryption
=============

10.1 General
------------

A 3GP file may include encrypted media together with information on key
management and requirements for decrypting and/or serving encrypted
media. Tracks containing encrypted media use dedicated sample entries
for encrypted media, which will be ignored by 3GP readers not capable of
handling encrypted media. 3GP readers capable of detecting encrypted
media are able to obtain \"in the clear\" the sample entries that apply
to the decrypted media as well as all requirements for decrypting the
media. Moreover, 3GP readers supporting extended presentations (see
clause 11) referring to media files rather than media tracks are
provided with all requirements for decrypting media files.

Clause 10.2 and 10.3 are provided here for information in the context of
3GP files. The definitions follow from \[7\].

10.2 Sample entries for encrypted media tracks
----------------------------------------------

The sample entries stored in the sample description box of a media track
in a 3GP file identify the format of the encoded media, i.e. codec and
other coding parameters. All valid sample entries for unencrypted media
in a 3GP file are described in Clause 6. The principle behind storing
encrypted media in a track is to \"disguise\" the original sample entry
with a generic sample entry for encrypted media. Table 10.1 gives an
overview of the formats (identifying sample entries) that can be used in
3GP files for signalling encrypted video, audio and text.

Table 10.1: Formats for encrypted media tracks

  -------------- --------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------
  Format         Original format                               Media content
  **\'encv\'**   \'s263\', , \'avc1\', ...                     encrypted video: H.263, H.264(AVC), ...
  **\'enca\'**   \'samr\', \'sawb\', \'sawp\', \'mp4a\', ...   encrypted audio: AMR, AMR-WB, AMR-WB+, Enhanced aacPlus, AAC, ...
  **\'enct\'**   \'tx3g\', ...                                 encrypted text: timed text, ...
  -------------- --------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------

The generic sample entries for encrypted media replicate the original
sample entries and include a Protection scheme information box with
details on the original format, as well as all requirements for
decrypting the encoded media. The EncryptedVideoSampleEntry and the
EncryptedAudioSampleEntry are defined in Tables 10.2 and 10.3, where the
ProtectionSchemeInfoBox (defined in clause 10.2) is simply added to the
list of boxes contained in a sample entry.

  All fields and boxes in an audio sample entry, e.g. MP4AudioSampleEntry or AMRSampleEntry.                                                                                   
  **ProtectionSchemeInfoBox**                                                                                     Box with information on the original format and encryption   
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------ ------------------------------------------------------------ ----------

The EncryptedVideoSampleEntry and the EncryptedAudioSampleEntry can also
be used with any additional codecs added to the 3GP file format, as long
as their sample entries are based on the SampleEntry of the ISO base
media file format \[7\].

The EncryptedTextSampleEntry is defined in Table 10.4. Text tracks are
specific to 3GP files and defined by the Timed text format \[4\]. In
analogy with the cases for audio and video, a ProtectionSchemeInfoBox is
added to the list of contained boxes.

  ------------------------------------------ ------------------ ------------------------------------------------------------ ----------

NOTE: The boxes within the sample entries defined in Tables 10.2-10.4
may not precede any of the fields. The order of the boxes (including the
ProtectionSchemeInfoBox) is not important though.

10.3 Key management
-------------------

The necessary requirements for decrypting media are stored in the
Protection scheme information box. For the case of media tracks, it
contains the Original format box, which identifies the codec of the
decrypted media. For both media tracks and media files, it contains the
Scheme type box, which identifies the protection scheme used to protect
the media, and the Scheme information box, which contains
scheme-specific data (defined for each scheme). It is out of the scope
of this specification to define a protection scheme.

The Protection scheme information box and its contained boxes are
defined in Tables 10.5 -- 10.8.

  -------------------- ------------------ ----------------------------------------------------- ----------

The boxes contained in the Scheme information box are defined by the
scheme type, which is out of the scope of this specification to define.

11 Extended presentation format
===============================

11.1 General
------------

A 3GP file may include an extended presentation that consists of media
files in addition to tracks for audio, video and text. Examples of such
media files are static images, e.g. JPEG files, which can be stored in a
3GP \"container file\". A 3GP container file that includes an extended
presentation must include a scene description that governs the rendering
of all parts of the 3GP file.

11.2 Storage format
-------------------

A 3GP file with an extended presentation shall include a Meta box
(\'meta\') at the top level of the file as defined in \[7\]. The Meta
box shall include the following boxes:

\- Handler box with handler type \'3gsd\' (3GPP scene description);

\- Primary item box or XML box identifying the scene description;

\- Item information box;

\- Item location box (see below).

A scene description (e.g. an SVG scene, in the case of DIMS, or a SMIL
file) shall be included either in an XML box or as an item located by
the Item location box. The scene description may refer to both tracks
and media files (items).

A 3GP file that contains media files and/or a scene description not
stored in an XML box shall include an Item location box locating all
contained files and the scene description. Each item corresponding to a
media file of the Item location box shall also be included in the Item
information box in order to specify its filename (item name) and MIME
type. The Item information box shall also include an entry for the scene
description that specifies its MIME type. By referring to a Protection
scheme information box in the Item protection box, the Item information
box can also indicate whether the content of an item is protected
(encrypted) as defined in \[7\] and discussed in clause 10 of the
present specification.

11.3 URL forms for items and tracks
-----------------------------------

All media files and the scene description included in a 3GP file are
logically located in the same directory as the 3GP file itself. In
general, the Meta box of a 3GP file serve as a container of files that
logically \"shadow\" files outside the 3GP file. See the description of
URL forms for Meta boxes in \[7\] for further details. The Movie box
(\'moov\') of a 3GP file contains all media tracks and possible scene
description update tracks.

The scene description (primary item) of a 3GP file addresses other
resources by using relative URLs. In particular it addresses

\- media files (items) by referring to their filenames;

\- media tracks by referring to the Movie box with the relative URL
\"\#box=moov\".

The default is to address all tracks of the Movie box. However, it is
possible to address individual media tracks in the Movie box by
referring to their track IDs. The relative URL of a track is defined in
terms of ABNF \[31\] as follows:

relative-track-URL = \"\#box=moov;track\_ID=\" track-number\* (\",\"
track-number)

track-number = 1\*digit

Hence, individual tracks are referenced by listing their numbers, e.g.
\"\#box=moov;track\_ID=1,3\".

A DIMS (SVG) scene description (primary item) can also address scene
updates in a track using the above URL forms. For instance, applying
updates to the scene description stored in track 1 after 10 seconds is
done as follows:

\<updates xlink:href=\"\#box=moov;track\_ID=1\" begin=\"10\"/\>

Note: It is possible to include a 3GP file with tracks as a media file
(addressed by filename) rather than using a top-level Movie box for
tracks. However, this way the included 3GP file will be \"hidden\" one
layer and interleaving between individual tracks and items less
transparent.

11.4 Examples
-------------

### 11.4.1 SMIL presentation

The following example consists of a slide show in SMIL consisting of
three images shown with the duration of 3 seconds each and an AMR clip
that is played in parallel. The presentation is built from a number of
separate files:

\- SMIL file: \"scene.smil\";

\- 3GP file with AMR: \"audioclip.3gp\";

\- Image files: \"pic1.jpg\", \"pic2.jpg\" and \"pic3.jpg\".

These files can be packaged into a single 3GP file \"presentation.3gp\"
as an extended presentation. The overall presentation is governed by the
SMIL file located as the primary item of \"presentation.3gp\":

> \<smil xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/SMIL20/Language\"\>\
> \<head\>\
> \<layout\>\
> \<root-layout width=\"176\" height=\"144\"/\>\
> \<region id=\"pics\" left=\"0\" width=\"176\" height=\"144\"/\>\
> \</layout\>\
> \</head\>\
> \<body\>\
> \<par\>\
> \<audio src=\"\#box=moov\" dur=\"9s\"/\>\
> \<seq\>\
> \<img region=\"pics\" src=\"pic1.jpg\" dur=\"3s\"/\>\
> \<img region=\"pics\" src=\"pic2.jpg\" dur=\"3s\"/\>\
> \<img region=\"pics\" src=\"pic3.jpg\" dur=\"3s\"/\>\
> \</seq\>\
> \</par\>\
> \</body\>\
> \</smil\>

The audio track resides in the Movie box and is referred to as
\"\#box=moov\", whereas the images are included as media files in the
Meta box.

### 11.4.2 DIMS presentation

The following example consists of a DIMS presentation that refers to
images, an AMR clip and scene updates. The presentation is contained in
a single Extended-presentation profile 3GP file containing:

\- DIMS scene description (SVG scene) stored as item 1 identified by a
Primary item box;

\- DIMS updates stored as a DIMS track (track ID 1);

\- AMR clip stored as an AMR track (track ID 2);

\- Image files: \"pic1.jpg\", \"pic2.jpg\" and \"pic3.jpg\" stored as
items 2, 3 and 4.

All references to the DIMS and AMR tracks and the images are made by
relative URLs from the DIMS Unit in the primary item:

> \<svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" version=\"1.2\"
> baseProfile=\"tiny\"\
> xmlns:xlink=http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\
> width=\"320\" height=\"240\" viewBox=\"0 0 320 240\"\>\
> \<desc\>DIMS example\</desc\>\
> \<updates xlink:href=\"\#box=moov;track\_ID=1\" begin=\"10\"/\>\
> \<audio xlink:href=\"\#box=moov;track\_ID=2\" audio-level=\"0.7\"\
> type=\"audio/AMR\" begin=\"10\"/\>\
> \<image x=\"0\" y=\"0\" width=\"100\" height=\"100\"
> xlink:href=\"pic1.jpg\"\>\
> \<image x=\"0\" y=\"100\" width=\"100\" height=\"100\"
> xlink:href=\"pic2.jpg\"\>\
> \<image x=\"100\" y=\"0\" width=\"100\" height=\"100\"
> xlink:href=\"pic3.jpg\"\>\
> \</svg\>

An Item information box specifies the MIME type of the scene description
(SVG scene) and the filenames and MIME types of the image files. An Item
location box specifies the locations of all items.

12 Media Stream Recording
=========================

12.1 Unprotected Stream Recording
---------------------------------

Received RTP media streams may be stored in 3GP files conforming to the
Media Stream Recording profile. RTP packets may be stored in RTP
reception hint tracks. RTCP packets may be stored in RTCP reception hint
tracks.

12.2 Protected Stream recording
-------------------------------

SRTP protected media may be stored in 3GP files conforming to the 3GP
Media Stream Recording Profile. SRTP and corresponding SRTCP packets are
stored in SRTP reception hint tracks and SRTCP reception hint tracks,
respectively, as described in \[38\]. Corresponding MIKEY MBMS Traffic
Key messages are stored in OMA BCAST STKM tracks as described in clause
12.2.1. Additionally, SDP and Protection Description information is
stored as described in clauses 12.3 and 12.2.2.

### 12.2.1 Key message tracks

MIKEY MBMS Traffic Key messages as defined in \[39\] shall be stored in
OMA BCAST STKM tracks \'oksd\' as defined in \[37\]. A 3GP file with
SRTP recording extensions shall contain at least one STKM track.
Furthermore, all key messages related a specific SRTP reception hint
track shall be recorded in the same STKM track. Track references of type
\'cdsc\' shall be used to link STKM tracks to SRTP reception hint tracks
as described in \[37\].

In the Sample Description Entry of the STKM track, the filed
sample\_version shall be set to 0x00 and the field sample\_type shall be
set to 0xf7. The value 0xf7 indicates MIKEY MBMS Traffic Key messages.

Each Sample Entry of a STKM track shall contain exactly one MIKEY MBMS
Traffic Key messages in the STKM field. That is, the STKM field shall
contain the payload of the received MIKEY package (without IP and UDP
headers) including all MIKEY headers and all MIKEY payloads and the
MIKEY MAC/Signature field.

### 12.2.2 Protection Description

The ServiceProtectionDescription box shall be defined as stated in table
12.1. The ServiceProtectionDescription box shall be included for each
Sample Description Entry of a SRTP reception hint track as a sub box of
the SchmeInformationBox \'schi\' in the SRTPProcessBox box \'srpp\' as
defined in \[7\].

**BoxHeader Size, Type, Version:** indicate the size, type and version
of the ServiceProtectionDescription box. The type shall be \'spdb\' and
the version shall be 0.

**SecurityDescription:**. This field shall contain the XML encoded
Service Protection Description Metadata Fragment as specified in \[40\]
with the restriction that only the mediaFlow element referring to the
SRTP stream from which this SRTP reception hint track was recorded is
contained. That is, the SecurityDescription shall contain exactly one
mediaFlow element and this element shall correspond to the stored SRTP
packets described by the Sample Description which also contains this
SecurityDescription.

12.3 SDP
--------

Fragments that together constitute an SDP description shall be contained
in a 3GP file with Media Stream recording extensions. Session-level SDP,
i.e. all lines before the first media-specific line (\"m=\" line), shall
be stored as Movie SDP information within the User Data box, as
specified in \[7\]. Media-level SDP, i.e. an \"m=\" line and the lines
before the next \"m=\" line (or end of SDP) shall be stored as Track SDP
information within the User data box of the corresponding track.
Media-level SDP shall be contained in each corresponding reception hint
track or media track.

13 HTTP streaming extensions
============================

13.1 Introduction
-----------------

This clause describes extensions to the 3GP file format related to
Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP as specified in 3GPP TS 26.247
\[49\] using HTTP \[48\] as delivery protocol for segments.

13.2 Segment types
------------------

It is possible in HTTP streaming to form files from segments - or
concatenated segments - which would not necessarily form 3GP compliant
files (e.g. they do not contain a movie box). If such segments are
stored in separate files (e.g. on a standard HTTP server) it is
recommended that these \'segment files\' start with a segment-type box,
to enable identification of those files, and declaration of the
specifications with which they are compliant.

A segment type has the same format as an \'ftyp\' box \[7\], except that
it takes the box type \'styp\'. The brands within it should include the
same brands that were included in the \'ftyp\' box that preceded the
\'moov\' box, and may also include additional brands to indicate the
compatibility of this segment with various specification(s) such as the
3GP Media Segment Profile defined in clause 5.4.10 of this
specification.

Valid segment type boxes shall be the first box in a segment. Segment
type boxes may be removed if segments are concatenated (e.g. to form a
full 3GP file), but this is not required. Segment type boxes that are
not first in their files may be ignored.

13.3 Track Fragment Adjustment Box
----------------------------------

Track Fragment Adjustment Boxes describe the relative time difference of
the first samples of tracks within a movie fragment. When randomly
accessing a 3GP file or a Media Segment at a movie fragment that
contains a Track Fragment Adjustment Box, the Track Fragment Adjustment
Box provides instructions on how the timeline of one or more of the
tracks may be modified to generate synchronization between the tracks.
For example, if, in the previous fragment, one track ended later than
another, the first sample of that track in this fragment will need to be
presented later also; an edit-list in the track fragment adjustment box
containing an empty edit, and then a media edit, achieves that effect.

The syntax of a Track Fragment Adjustment Box as described below is
identical to that of edit-lists. However, unlike edit-lists, which must
always be applied, when present, to adjust the timelines of the
containing tracks, a Track Fragment Adjustment Box may only be applied
when randomly accessing a 3GP file or a Media Segment at a movie
fragment containing the Track Fragment Adjustment Box. In continuous
playback, wherein the track alignment is known (e.g. from decoding the
previous segment) and sync between tracks has been achieved, Track
Fragment Adjustment Box shall not be applied.

The container of the Track Fragment Adjustment Box is the Track Fragment
Box. If present, the Track Fragment Adjustment Box should be positioned
after the Track Fragment Header Box and before the first Track Fragment
Run box. The Track Fragment Adjustment Box is a container for the Track
Fragment Media Adjustment Boxes.

aligned(8) class TrackFragmentAdjustmentBox extends Box(\'tfad\') {\
}

The Track Fragment Media Adjustment Box provides explicit time line
offsets. By indicating \'empty\' time, or by defining a \'dwell\', the
offset can advantageously delay the playback time of the media in the
track so that media in different tracks can be synchronized.
Alternatively, the media\_time value may be used to discard part of the
\"earlier\" tracks.

aligned(8) class TrackFragmentMediaAdjustmentBox extends
FullBox(\'tfma\', version, 0) {\
unsigned int(32) entry\_count;\
for (i=1; i \<= entry\_count; i++) {\
if (version==1) {\
unsigned int(64) segment\_duration;\
int(64) media\_time;\
} else { // version==0\
unsigned int(32) segment\_duration;\
int(32) media\_time;\
}\
int(16) media\_rate\_integer;\
int(16) media\_rate\_fraction = 0;\
}\
}

**version** is an integer that specifies the version of this box (0 or
1).

**entry\_count** is an integer that gives the number of entries in the
following table.

**segment\_duration** is an integer that specifies the duration of this
adjustment segment in units of the timescale in the Movie Header Box.
\"Adjustment segment\" in this context does not refer to the \"Media
Segment\" that contains the \'tfma\' but refers to the operation that is
performed to place the track at appropriate composition time.

**media\_time** is an integer containing the starting time within the
media of this adjustment segment (in media time scale units, in
composition time). If this field is set to -1, it is an empty edit. The
last adjustment in a track shall never be an empty edit.

**media\_rate\_integer** specifies the relative rate at which to play
the media corresponding to this adjustment segment. If this value is 0,
then the adjustment is specifying a \'dwell\': the media at media-time
is presented for the segment-duration. Otherwise this field shall
contain the value 1.

13.4 Segment Index Box
----------------------

The Segment Index box (\'sidx\') provides a compact index of one track
within the media segment to which it applies. The index is referring to
movie fragments and other Segment Index Boxes in a segment.

Each Segment Index Box documents how a (sub)segment is divided into one
or more subsegments (which may themselves be subdivided using Segment
Index boxes). A subsegment is defined as a time interval of the
containing (sub)segment, and corresponds to a single range of bytes of
the containing (sub)segment. The durations of all the subsegments sum to
the duration of the containing (sub)segment.

Specifically for this file format a subsegment is a self-contained set
of one or more consecutive movie fragment boxes with corresponding Media
Data box(es) and a Media Data Box containing data referenced by a Movie
Fragment Box must follow that Movie Fragment box and precede the next
Movie Fragment box containing information about the same track. The
presentation times documented in the Segment Index are in the movie
timeline that is they are composition times after the application of any
edit list for the track.

Each entry in the Segment Index box contains a reference type that
indicates whether the reference points directly to the media bytes of a
referenced leaf subsegment, or to a Segment Index box that describes how
the referenced subsegment is further subdivided; as a result, the
segment may be indexed in a \'hierarchical\' or \'daisy-chain\' or other
form by documenting time and byte offset information for other Segment
Index boxes applying to portions of the same (sub)segment.

A Segment Index box provides information about a single track of the
Segment, referred to as the reference stream. If provided, the first
Segment Index box in a segment, for a given track, shall document the
entirety of that track in the segment, and shall precede any other
Segment Index box in the segment for the same track.

**If a Segment Index is present for at least one track but not all
tracks in the segment, then** normally a track in which not every sample
is independently coded, such as video, is selected to be indexed. F**or
any track for which no segment index is present, referred to as
non-indexed stream, the track associated with the first Segment Index
box in the segment serves as a reference stream in a sense that it also
describes the subsegments for any non-indexed track.**

A Segment Index box contains a sequence of references to subsegments of
the (sub)segment documented by the box. The referenced subsegments are
contiguous in presentation time. Similarly, the bytes referred to by a
Segment Index box are always contiguous within the segment. The
referenced size gives the count of the number of bytes in the material
referenced.

> NOTE: A media segment may be indexed by more than one \"top-level\"
> Segment Index box that are independent of each other, each of which
> indexes one track within the media segment. In segments containing
> multiple tracks the referenced bytes may contain media from multiple
> tracks, even though the Segment Index box provides timing information
> for only one track.

The anchor point for a Segment Index box is the first byte after that
box.

Within the two constraints (a) that, in time, the subsegments are
contiguous, that is, each entry in the loop is consecutive from the
immediately preceding one and (b) within a given segment the referenced
bytes are contiguous, there are a number of possibilities, including:

1\) a reference to a segment index box may include, in its byte count,
immediately following Segment Index boxes that document subsegments;

2\) using the first\_offset field, it is possible to separate Segment
Index boxes from the media that they refer to;

3\) it is possible to locate Segment Index boxes for subsegments close
to the media they index.

The Segment Index box documents the presence of Stream Access Points
(SAPs), as specified in Annex G.6 of TS26.247 \[49\], in the referenced
subsegments. The annex specifies characteristics of SAPs, such as
I~SAU~, I~SAP~ and T~SAP~, as well as SAP types, which are all used in
the semantics below. A subsegment starts with a SAP when the subsegment
contains a SAP, and for the first SAP, I~SAU~ is the index of the first
sample that follows I~SAP~, and I~SAP~ is contained in the subsegment.

The container for \'sidx\' box is the file or segment directly.

}\
}

**reference\_track\_ID** provides the track\_ID for the reference track;
if this Segment Index box is referenced from a \"parent\" Segment Index
box, the value of reference\_ID shall be the same as the value of
reference\_ID of the \"parent\" Segment Index box

**timescale** provides the timescale, in ticks per second, for the time
and duration fields within this box; it is recommended that this match
the timescale of the reference track, i.e. the timescale field of the
Media Header Box of the track.

**earliest\_presentation\_time** is the earliest presentation time of
any sample in the reference track in the first subsegment, expressed in
the timescale of the timescale field.

**first\_offset** is the distance in bytes from the first byte following
the containing Segment Indexing Box, to the first byte of the first
referenced box.

**reference\_count**: the number of elements indexed by second loop.

**reference\_type**: when set to 0 indicates that the reference is to a
movie fragment (\'moof\') box; when set to 1 indicates that the
reference is to a segment index (\'sidx\') box.

**referenced\_size**: the distance in bytes from the first byte of the
referenced box to the first byte of the next referenced box or in the
case of the last entry, the first byte not indexed by this Segment Index
Box.

**subsegment\_duration**: when the reference is to Segment Index Box,
this field carries the sum of the subsegment\_duration fields in that
box; when the reference is to a subsegment, this field carries the
difference between the earliest presentation time of any sample of the
reference track in the next subsegment (or the first subsegment of the
next segment, if this is the last subsegment of the segment or the end
composition time of the reference track if this is the last subsegment
of the representation) and the earliest presentation time of any sample
of the reference track in the referenced subsegment; the duration is
expressed in the timescale value in this box.

**starts\_with\_SAP:** indicates whether the referenced subsegments
start with a SAP. For the detailed semantics of this field in
combination with other fields, see the table below.

**SAP\_type**: indicates a SAP type as specified in TS26.247 \[49\],
Annex G.6, or the value 0. Other type values are reserved. For the
detailed semantics of this field in combination with other fields, see
the table below.

**SAP\_delta\_time**: indicates T~SAP~ of the first SAP, in decoding
order, in the referenced subsegment for the reference stream. If the
referenced subsegments do not contain a SAP, SAP\_delta\_time is
reserved with the value 0; otherwise SAP\_delta\_time is the difference
between the earliest presentation time of the subsegment, and the T~SAP~
(note that this difference may be zero, in the case that the subsegment
starts with a SAP).

  1                   1 to 6,\    1 (index)         All the referenced subsegments start with a SAP of at most the given SAP\_type and none of these SAPs is of an unknown type.
                      inclusive                     
  ------------------- ----------- ----------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

13.5 Track Fragment Decode Time Box
-----------------------------------

The Track Fragment Base Media Decode Time (\'tfdt\') Box provides the
decode time of the first sample in the track fragment. This can be
useful, for example, when performing random access in a file; it is not
necessary to sum the sample durations of all preceding samples in
previous fragments to find this value (where the sample durations are
the deltas in the Decoding Time to Sample Box and the sample\_durations
in the preceding track runs).

The Track Fragment Base Media Decode Time Box, if present, shall be
positioned after the Track Fragment Header Box and before the first
Track Fragment Run box.

> Note: the decode timeline is a media timeline, established before any
> explicit or implied mapping of media time to presentation time, for
> example by an edit list or similar structure.

aligned(8) class TrackFragmentBaseMediaDecodeTimeBox\
extends FullBox(\'tfdt\', version, 0) {\
if (version==1) {\
unsigned int(64) baseMediaDecodeTime;\
} else { // version==0\
unsigned int(32) baseMediaDecodeTime;\
}\
}

**version** is an integer that specifies the version of this box (0 or 1
in this specification).

**baseMediaDecodeTime** is an integer equal to the sum of the decode
durations of all earlier samples in the media, expressed in the media\'s
timescale. It does not include the samples added in the enclosing track
fragment.

14 Storage of CVO (Coordination of Video Orientation) data in the 3GPP File Format
==================================================================================

When CVO data is stored in the 3GPP File Fomat, a timed metadata track
shall be used with CVOSampleEntry box as described in clause 6.11.
CVOSampleEntry indicates that the metadata sample format is a single
byte of CVO data as defined in 26.114 \[50\]. Each metadata track
containing CVO data should reference the video track which it describes
using the \'cdsc\' track reference as defined in the ISO base media file
format \[7\].

15 Location timed metadata in the 3GPP File Format
==================================================

When Location timed metadata is stored in the 3GPP File Fomat, a timed
metadata track shall be used with LocationSampleEntry box as described
in clause 6.12. The presence of LocationSampleEntry indicates that the
metadata sample format are the fields of the Location Information box in
Table 8.10 starting from the Role field, i.e. as shown in the table
below:

Table 15.1: Location timed metadata Sample Format

  -------------------- ------------------ ------------------------------------------------- -----------
  **Field**            **Type**           **Details**                                       **Value**
  Role                 Unsigned int(8)    Non-negative value indicating role of location    
  Longitude            Unsigned int(32)   Fixed-point value of the longitude                
  Latitude             Unsigned int(32)   Fixed-point value of the latitude                 
  Altitude             Unsigned int(32)   Fixed-point value of the Altitude                 
  Astronomical\_body   String             Text of astronomical body                         
  Additional\_notes    String             Text of additional location-related information   
  -------------------- ------------------ ------------------------------------------------- -----------

For the definitions of these fields, see the definitions of the Location
Information box in clause 8.2.

16 Quality timed metadata in the 3GPP File Format
=================================================

Quality metadata refers to video quality metrics based on associated
measurements of the media data, as described in clause 4 of \[53\] and
clause 6.17 of \[54\]. When quality metadata data is stored in the 3GPP
File Fomat, a timed metadata track shall be used with
QualityMetricsSampleEntry box as described in clause 4 of \[53\].

17 Orientation timed metadata in the 3GPP File Format
=====================================================

WhenOrientation timed metadata is stored in the 3GPP File Fomat, a timed
metadata track shall be used with OrientationSampleEntry box as
described in clause 6.13. The presence of OrientationSampleEntry
indicates that the metadata sample format are the fields of the
Orientation Information box in Table 8.12d starting from the field
Digital\_zoom. Each metadata track containing Orientation data should
reference the video track which it describes using the \'cdsc\' track
reference as defined in the ISO base media file format \[7\]

######## Annex A (normative): MIME Type Registrations for 3GP files

A.1 MIME Types
==============

A.1.1 General
-------------

This registration is an update and replacement of RFC 3839. It applies
to all files defined as using the \'3GP\' file format and identified
with a suitable brand in a 3GPP specification. The usual file suffix for
all these files is \".3gp\". The difference between the current
registration and RFC 3839 is the inclusion of two optional parameters.

A.1.2 Files with audio but no visual content
--------------------------------------------

The type \"audio/3gpp\" may be used for files containing audio but no
visual presentation (neither video nor timed text, for example).

Type name: audio

Subtype name: 3gpp

Required parameters: none

Optional parameters:

> codecs: is a single value or a comma-separated list that identifies
> the codec(s) needed for rendering the content contained (in tracks) of
> a file. The codecs parameter is defined in RFC 6381 \[32\]. The ISO
> file format name space and ISO syntax in clauses 3.3 and 3.4 of RFC
> 6381, respectively, shall be used together with additions defined in
> clause A.2.2 of the present document.
>
> types: is a single value or a comma-separated list that identifies the
> MIME media types of the content contained (in items) in a file. It is
> defined in clause A.2.3 of the present document.

Encoding considerations: files are binary and should be transmitted in a
suitable encoding without CR/LF conversion, 7-bit stripping etc.; base64
(RFC 4648 \[35\]) is a suitable encoding.

Security considerations: see the security considerations section in A.3
of the present document.

Interoperability considerations: The 3GPP organization has defined the
specification, interoperability, and conformance. IMTC conducts
interoperability testing.

Published specification: 3GPP TS 26.234, Release 5; 3GPP TS 26.244,
Release 6 or later. 3GPP specifications are publicly accessible at the
3GPP web site, www.3gpp.org.

Applications which use this media type: Multi-media

Additional information: The type \"audio/3gpp\" may be used for files
containing audio but no visual presentation. Files served under this
type must not contain any visual material. (Note that timed text is
visually presented and is considered to be visual material).

Magic number(s): None. However, the file-type box must occur first in
the file, and must contain a 3GPP brand in its compatible brands list.

File extension(s): \'3gp\' and \'3gpp\' are both declared at
http://www.nist.gov/nics/; 3gp is preferred

Macintosh File Type Code(s): \'3gpp\'

Intended usage: COMMON

Restrictions on usage: Note that this MIME type is used only for files;
separate types are used for real-time transfer, such as for the RTP
payload format for AMR audio (RFC 4867 \[15\]).

A.2 Optional parameters
=======================

A.2.1 General
-------------

Two optional parameters are defined here for the \"audio/3gpp\" and
\"video/3gpp\" media types. Additional parameters may be specified by
updating the media type registrations. Any unknown parameter shall be
ignored.

A.2.2 Codecs parameter
----------------------

The codecs parameter is defined in RFC 6381. The ISO file format name
space and ISO syntax in clauses 3.3 and 3.4 of RFC 6381 \[32\] shall be
used together with extensions to the ISO syntax specified here.

The syntax in clause 3.4 of RFC 6381 defines the usage of the codecs
parameter for files based on the ISO base media file format and
specifies that the first element of a parameter value is a sample
description entry four-character code. It also includes specific
definitions for MPEG audio (\'mp4a\') where each value in addition to
the four-character code includes two elements signalling Object Type
Indications and Profile Level Indications (video only). It also includes
specific definitions for Advanced Video Coding (\'avc1\') where each
value in addition to the four-character code includes a second element
(referred to as \'avcoti\' in the formal syntax), which is the
hexadecimal representation of the following three bytes in the (subset)
sequence parameter set Network Abstraction Layer (NAL) unit specified in
\[29\]: (1) profile\_idc,(2) the byte containing the constraint\_set
flags (currently constraint\_set0\_flag through constraint\_set5\_flag,
and the reserved\_zero\_2bits), and (3) level\_idc. Note also that
reserved\_zero\_2bits is required to be equal to 0 in \[29\], but other
values for it may be specified in the future by ITU-T or ISO/IEC. These
definitions apply to the MPEG codecs used by the 3GP file format, such
as H.264 (AVC) \[29\], MPEG-4 AAC \[13\] and Enhanced aacPlus \[23, 24,
25\]. Values for other codecs used by the 3GP file format are specified
below.

When the first element of a value is \'s263\', indicating H.263 video
\[9\], the second element is the decimal representation of the profile,
e.g., 0 or 3, and the third element is the decimal representation of the
level, e.g. 10 or 45.

When the first element of a value is one of the following elements, no
other elements are defined for that value:

\- \'samr\', indicating AMR narrow-band speech \[11\];

\- \'sawb\', indicating AMR wide-band speech \[12\];

\- \'sawp\', indicating Extended AMR wide-band audio \[21\];

> \- \'sevs\', indicating EVS speech \[55\];

\- \'tx3g\', indicating timed text \[4\];

\- \'3gvo\', indicating CVO as defined in clauses 6.11 and 14.

The following syntax defines all values above in ABNF (RFC 4234 \[31\])
by extending the definition in clause 3.4 of RFC 6381:

> id-iso = iso-gen / iso-mpega / iso-mpegv / iso-amr / iso-amr-wb /
> iso-amr-wbp / iso-evs / iso-tt / iso-h263; = iso-gen, iso-mepga,
> iso-mpegv, iso-avc as defined in RFC 6381
>
> iso-amr = %x73.61.6d.72 ; \'samr\'
>
> iso-amr-wb = %x73.61.77.62 ; \'sawb\'
>
> iso-amr-wbp = %x73.61.6d.70 ; \'sawp\'
>
> iso-evs = %x73.65.76.73 ; \'sevs\'
>
> iso-tt = %x74.78.33.67 ; \'tx3g\'
>
> iso-cvo = %x33.67.76.6f ; \'3gvo\'
>
> iso-h263 = s263 \".\" h263-profile \".\" h263-level
>
> s263 = %x73.32.36.33 ; \'s263\'
>
> h263-profile = 1\*DIGIT
>
> h263-level = 1\*DIGIT

The elements of the codecs parameter for H.265 (HEVC) are specified as
below.

> NOTE: The following specification replaces that in clause E.3 of
> \[20\].

When the first element of a value is a code indicating a codec from the
High Efficiency Video Coding specification (ISO/IEC 23008-2), as
documented in clause 8 of \[20\] (such as \'hev1\' or \'hvc1\'), the
elements following are a series of values from the HEVC decoder
configuration record, separated by period characters (\".\"). In all
numeric encodings, leading zeroes may be omitted,

\- the general\_profile\_space, encoded as no character
(general\_profile\_space == 0), or \'A\', \'B\', \'C\' for
general\_profile\_space 1, 2, 3, followed by the general\_profile\_idc
encoded as a decimal number;

\- the 32 bits of the **general\_profile\_compatibility\_flags, but in
reverse bit order, i.e. with
general\_profile\_compatibility\_flag\[ 31 \] as the most significant
bit, followed by , general\_profile\_compatibility\_flag\[ 30 \], and
down to general\_profile\_compatibility\_flag\[ 0 \] as the least
significant bit, where general\_profile\_compatibility\_flag\[ i \] for
i in the range of 0 to 31, inclusive, are specified in** ISO/IEC
23008-2, encoded in hexadecimal (leading zeroes may be omitted);

\- the general\_tier\_flag, encoded as \'L\' (general\_tier\_flag==0) or
\'H\' (general\_tier\_flag==1), followed by the general\_level\_idc,
encoded as a decimal number;

\- each of the 6 bytes of the constraint flags, starting from the byte
containing the general\_progressive\_source\_flag, each encoded as a
hexadecimal number, and the encoding of each byte separated by a period;
trailing bytes that are zero may be omitted.

Examples:

> codecs=hev1.1.6.L93.B0
>
> a progressive, non-packed stream, Main Profile, Main Tier, Level 3.1.
> (Only one byte of the constraint flags is given here; The value after
> the second period is 6 instead of 2 because according to ISO/IEC
> 23008-2 a Main Profile bitstream should also be marked as compatible
> to the Main 10 Profile).
>
> codecs=hev1.A4.41.H120.B0.23
>
> a (mythical) progressive, non-packed stream in profile space 1, with
> general\_profile\_idc 4, some compatibility flags set, and in High
> tier at Level 4 and two bytes of constraint flags supplied.

For Quality metrics metadata track, the usage of the codecs parameter is
specified in \[53\].

A.2.3 Types parameter
---------------------

The types parameter is a single value or a comma-separated list that
identifies the MIME media types of the content contained (in items) of a
3GP file. Each value consists of a type-subtype pair and corresponds to
a value of the content\_type field provided for an item in the item
information box.

If the types parameter is present, then it shall include all MIME types
needed for rendering the content contained (in items) of a file.

The types parameter is defined in ABNF (RFC 5234 \[44\]) below:

types = \"types\" \"=\" type-list

type-entry = type-name \"/\" subtype-name \*( \*WSP\";\" \*WSP parameter
)

parameter = attribute \*WSP \"=\" \*WSP value

attribute = token

value = token / quoted-string

token = 1\*(%x21 / %x23-27 / %x2A-2B / %x2D-2E / %x30-39

/ %x41-5A / %x5E-7E)

; 1\*\<any CHAR except SP, CTLs or tspecials\>

type-list = DQUOTE type-entry \*( \",\" type-entry ) DQUOTE

\"type-name\" and \"subtype-name\" are defined in RFC4288\[42\].

\"tspecials\" is defined in RFC2045\[45\]

\"quoted-string\" is defined in RFC5322\[43\].

\"CHAR\", \"CTL\", \"SP\", \"WSP\" and \"DQUOTE\" are defined in RFC
5234 \[31\].

NOTE: any \<\"\> character in \"type-entry\" needs to be escaped with
\"\\\". This is not shown in the above grammar.

A.3 Security considerations
===========================

The 3GPP file format may contain audio, video, displayable text data,
images, graphics, scene descriptions, etc. Clearly it is possible to
author malicious files which attempt to call for an excessively large
picture size, high sampling-rate audio etc. However, clients can and
usually do protect themselves against this kind of attack. It should be
noted that selected metadata fields may encompass information partly
intended to protect the media against unauthorized use or distribution.
In this case, the intention is that alteration or removal of the data in
the field would be treated as an offense under national agreements based
on World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) treaties.

There is no current provision in the standards for signing or
authentication of these file formats.
