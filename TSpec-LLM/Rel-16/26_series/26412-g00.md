Foreword
========

This Technical Specification has been produced by the 3^rd^ Generation
Partnership Project (3GPP).

The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work
within the TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the
TSG modify the contents of the present document, it will be re-released
by the TSG with an identifying change of release date and an increase in
version number as follows:

Version x.y.z

where:

x the first digit:

1 presented to TSG for information;

2 presented to TSG for approval;

3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.

y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e.
technical enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.

z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been
incorporated in the document.

Introduction
============

This document provides information on obtaining reference software for
the 3GPP File Format.

1 Scope
=======

The present document serves as a \"cover note\" for the source code of
the 3GPP file format.

2 References
============

The following documents contain provisions which, through reference in
this text, constitute provisions of the present document.

\- References are either specific (identified by date of publication,
edition number, version number, etc.) or non‑specific.

\- For a specific reference, subsequent revisions do not apply.

\- For a non-specific reference, the latest version applies. In the case
of a reference to a 3GPP document (including a GSM document), a
non-specific reference implicitly refers to the latest version of that
document *in the same Release as the present document*.

Service (PSS); 3GPP file format (3GP)\".

3 Source code
=============

The definition of the 3GPP file format \[1\] is derived from the ISO
Base Media File Format, as published by ISO/IEC in ISO/IEC 14496-12
(technically identical to 15444-12) \[2\]. The reference software for
the file format is also therefore maintained by ISO/IEC, as part of the
overall reference software \[3\]. However, that reference software was
\"frozen\" some time ago, and more recent versions may be available from
the registration authority for the file format, called (for historical
reasons) MP4 REG\[4\].

For convenience, a compiled copy of the library and appropriate headers,
for Windows, are included here. The library can be built for other
operating systems platforms also, from the source.
