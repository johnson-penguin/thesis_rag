Introduction
============

Mobile telephony devices and voice services continue to develop and
evolve and their associated minimum performance requirements and test
methodologies also need to stay relevant and representative of quality
demands.

While many advances were made in Release 11 to the acoustic requirements
and test specifications in TS 26.131 \[13\] and TS 26.132 \[8\] many
items therein were left marked \"for further study\" and require a final
decision by SA4. Additionally, there are new acoustic requirements and
emerging tests worth considering in a future release, but that require
further study before incorporation into specifications.

This technical report will, first and foremost, address the remaining
items presently designated as \"for further study\" in TS 26.131 \[13\]
and TS 26.132 \[8\].

The present document will also examine opportunities for new acoustic
tests and requirements that help us to better characterize the UE
acoustic experience, opportunities to replace existing test methods with
others that are more accurate or more efficient and make specific
recommendations for their inclusion in existing or new specifications.

1 Scope
=======

The scope of the present document is to investigate, first and foremost,
the existing items presently designated as \"for further study\" in TS
26.131 \[13\] and TS 26.132 \[8\].

The investigation will additionally identify, examine and evaluate
opportunities for new acoustic tests and requirements that better help
characterize the UE acoustic experience, opportunities to replace
existing test methods with others that are more accurate or more
efficient and to make specific recommendations for their inclusion in
existing or new specifications.

While many advances were made in Release 11 to the acoustic requirements
and test specifications in TS 26.131 \[13\] and TS 26.132 \[8\] many
items therein were left marked \"for further study\" and require a final
disposition by SA4 including:

\- NB & WB Stability loss, Headset UE (TS 26.131 \[13\], subclauses 5.6
& 6.6).

\- NB & WB Delay, Wireless Headset (TS 26.131 \[13\], subclauses
5.12.2.2 & 6.11.2.2).

\- NB & WB Echo control (\"double-talk\") characteristics (TS 26.131
\[13\], subclauses 5.13 & 6.12, TS 26.132 \[8\], subclause 8.11).

\- Handset, Headset, Handheld hands-free, Desktop and vehicle mounted
hands-free are all marked FFS.

\- NB& WB Free-field measurements for vehicle-mounted hands-free (TS
26.132 \[8\], subclauses 7.2.3 & 8.2.3).

\- NB & WB Idle Channel Noise, Sending/Receiving of test signal (TS
26.132 \[8\], subclauses 7.3.1, 7.3.2, 8.3.1 & 8.3.2).

Additionally, there are new acoustic requirements and emerging tests
that may be considered in a future release, but require further study
before incorporation to our specifications. It has been anticipated that
topics in this area would include, but would not be limited to, an
evaluation of:

\- Time-variant user behaviour.

\- Additional UE usage environments.

\- New or refined test methods for existing requirements.

\- Acceptance of updates (if any) to existing ETSI and ITU-T
dependencies.

### 4.3.1 Results from a study on NB Echo control (\"double-talk\") characteristics using P.835 methodology

#### 4.3.1.1 Background

In Release 11 of TS 26.132 \[8\], new methods for evaluation of echo
control characteristics were introduced in Clauses 7.11 and 8.11.
However, corresponding requirements were not defined in
TS 26.131 \[13\].

A subjective listening test based on methods from Recommendation ITU-T
P.835 \[4\] was conducted in order to provide some data for purposes of
investigating possible requirements.

Instead of a conversational test, or talking and listening test, the
present document provides results from listening only test, so
participants did not experience echo while talking, only while passively
listening. Below are presented results of the subjective evaluation of
real speech double talk test, for 12 devices, in both handset and
handheld speakerphone for narrow band.

#### 4.3.1.2 Test Method & Results

##### 4.3.1.2.1 Methods

The categories defined in Clauses 7.11, Figure 17b5, (copied below in
Figure 1 for convenience) and Table 1 (Table 2c, and 8.11, Figure 19b5,
and Table 2g), are described in perceptually-relevant terms.

  ---------- ----------------------- --------------------- -----------------------------------------------

##### 4.3.1.2.1.1 Rating scales {#rating-scales .H6}

The impairments in categories A2, B, C, and D can be understood as
distortions of the uplink speech. In contrast, the impairments in
categories E, F, and G can be understood as intrusions of residual or
continuous echo. Based on these observations, the rating scales of P.835
\[4\], SIG, BAK, and OVRL, as shown in Figures 2 below, were adopted for
this listening evaluation. In this study, the BAK rating scale was used
to quantify the level of intrusiveness of any echo. In other P.835
studies, the BAK rating scale has been more typically used to quantify
the level of intrusiveness of background noise.

height="2.634027777777778in"}

Figure 2c (Figure 7/P.835): Overall quality rating scale

It was anticipated that the impairments in categories A2, B, C and D,
would be related to ratings on the SIG (speech distortion) scale, and
that impairments in categories E, F, and G would be related to the
ratings on the BAK background intrusiveness scale.

##### 4.3.1.2.1.2 Speech Source {#speech-source .H6}

The speech source used is Segment 2 (four sentences) of the current
double talk test, British English from Recommendation ITU-T P.501
\[21\]. This includes two male and two female talkers. While this is
rather limited in comparison to some subjective tests, the exact signal
and conditions are used to facilitate direct comparisons with the
objective measures. For each presentation and rating, a single sentence
was presented (total of four sentences, from two male and two female
speakers).

##### 4.3.1.2.1.3 Reference Signals {#reference-signals .H6}

For the SIG dimension, the Wiener-filter based reference system proposed
in \[5\] and used in \[6\] was used. While this reference system has
been primarily used as a reference for noise suppression, as many echo
control systems provide echo suppression using a multi-band attenuation
mechanism, it seems reasonable to use that reference system in this
context. Expert listening to the reference system and the distortions
introduced by the devices exhibiting higher levels of impairments in the
A2, B, C and D categories indicated qualitatively similar perceptions.
Four levels of Wiener-filter-based distortion, similar to those used in
P.835 tests for noise suppression and judged by expert listeners to span
the range from 1 to 5, were used.

For the BAK dimension, recordings of echo were made on a device with the
ability to disable the AEC system, and to capture signals at the
microphone. To acquire the BAK echo component, the signal defined in TS
26.132 \[8\], Clause 7.11.1, for use in the receiving direction was
injected into the input of a network simulator. The resulting echo
signal from the device was recorded at the microphone of the device. The
level of the receiving signal was adjusted to yield a range of echo
levels. To construct the BAK references, the speech and echo signals
were mixed at a range of Speech to Echo Ratios (SER): 0, 12, 24 and 36
dB SER. It is noted, in Figure 5, that the resulting range of BAK scales
using these SER values is somewhat compressed to below 2.5 MOS. Use of
an alternative range of SER (e.g. 0, 24, 36, 48 dB) may provide a more
uniform range of BAK scores.

Three additional reference signals consisting of a combination of
Wiener-filter distortion and echo, with increasing levels of both, were
also constructed, resulting in a total of 11 impaired references (4
Wiener-filter, 4 echo-only, 3 Wiener-filter and echo). Clean speech was
used as the twelfth reference signal.

##### 4.3.1.2.1.4 Listening mode and level {#listening-mode-and-level .H6}

Presentation was made monaurally, at 79 dB SPL, using closed-back
Sennheiser HD-280 Pro headphones, without any additional equalization.

##### 4.3.1.2.1.5 Listening Panel {#listening-panel .H6}

Results are reported for a listening panel that consisted of 32 naïve
listeners, native speakers of American English, all with self-reported
normal hearing.

Listeners were presented with a practice block of signals including
references for familiarization with the task. The rating scales
described in Clause 4.3.1.2.1.1 were used.

##### 4.3.1.2.1.6 Measurement Set up {#measurement-set-up .H6}

As noted above, the measurements were taken corresponding to the method
defined in Clause 7.11 of TS 26.132 \[8\]. To clarify the relationships
between input signals and measurements used in the listening-only test,
schematic depictions of the input signal paths and measurements are
provided below, with the single talk configuration shown in Figure 3a
and the double-talk configuration shown in Figure 3b.

![](media/image5.png){width="6.692361111111111in"

![](media/image6.png){width="6.684722222222222in"
height="2.1597222222222223in"}

Figure 3b: Signal paths for double talk configuration

In the double talk configuration, there is a double talk situation at
the terminal, as indicated by the dotted line enclosing the signals in
sending and receiving direction (note that the methods in TS 26.132
\[8\] include provisions to time-align the acoustic signals at the
terminal).

In both Figures 3a and 3b, the dotted box enclosing a portion of the
Uplink measurement indicates that portion of the test signal that is
used in the listening-only experiments.

In the single talk configuration, there is no possibility of impairment
of the uplink measurement/listening file due to the presence of the
downlink. In contrast, in the double talk configuration, the signal in
the receiving direction is present simultaneously with the signal in the
sending direction. There is the possibility of impairment of the speech
in the sending direction due the action of the echo canceller in the
terminal. Also, there is the possibility of the presence of residual
echo induced by the receiving signal in the uplink measurement and
listening file.

##### 4.3.1.2.1.7 Test Conditions {#test-conditions .H6}

Twelve commercially-available devices were tested using the methods of
TS 26.132 \[8\], Clause 7.11, in both handset and hand-held speakerphone
modes to obtain test stimuli. Recordings of Segment 2 in both
single-talk (ST) and double-talk (DT) conditions were collected and used
for testing.

A total of 48 listening conditions, comprised of 12 UEs, 2 use cases
(handset and hand-held speakerphone) and 2 echo conditions (single-talk
and double-talk), were tested. A fully balanced design using all four
sentences was used, resulting in 192 votes per condition.

##### 4.3.1.2.2 Results

##### 4.3.1.2.2.0 General {#general .H6}

Results for the reference signals are shown in Figures 4, 5, and 6. The
error bars indicated 95^th^ percentile confidence intervals, based on 34
participants.

![](media/image9.wmf){width="4.70625in" height="3.6375in"}

Figure 6: Speech distortion and SER vary

From Figures 4, 5, and 6, it can be seen that the selected reference
systems result in listeners\' using the full range of the scales, with
good separation of the SIG and BAK scales for the NS and SER references
respectively.

##### 4.3.1.2.2.1 Results for test conditions, Handset mode {#results-for-test-conditions-handset-mode .H6}

Figures 7, 8 and 9 show the ratings for 12 devices in handset, SIG, BAK,
and OVRL, respectively. The error bars show 95% confidence intervals.
Blue bars show single-talk (no echo) while red bars show ratings for
double-talk (with echo). The test conditions are as defined in Clause
7.11.

Figure 7: SIG ratings for Handset mode

The SIG ratings for all devices in ST are uniformly high, as might be
expected. A few devices, I and K, show significant SIG degradations in
double talk.

Figure 8: BAK ratings for Handset mode

The BAK ratings for all devices in ST are also uniformly high (except
possibly device B). A few devices, G and L, show significant BAK
degradations in double talk.

Figure 9: OVRL ratings for Handset mode

The OVRL ratings for all devices in ST are also uniformly high. A few
devices, G, I, K, and L, show significant OVRL degradations in double
talk, consistent with the results in Figures 7 and 8.

##### 4.3.1.2.2.2 Results for test conditions, Hand-held Hands-free mode {#results-for-test-conditions-hand-held-hands-free-mode .H6}

Figures 10, 11 and 12 show the ratings for 12 devices in hand-held
hands-free, SIG, BAK, and OVRL, respectively. The error bars show 95 %
confidence intervals. Blue bars show single-talk (no echo) while red
bars show ratings for double-talk (with echo).

Figure 10: SIG ratings for Hand-held Hands-free mode

The SIG ratings for all devices in ST are generally high with the
possible exception of devices B, G, and I. As might be expected, the SIG
results in doubletalk for hand-held hands-free mode show substantial
impairments, with a relatively large range from 3.0 (device A) to nearly
1.0 (Device G).

Figure 11: BAK ratings for Hand-held Hands-free mode

The BAK ratings for all devices in ST show some reduction over handset
mode, with more devices showing performance below 4.0 (devices A, B, and
I. For double talk, the BAK results are fairly consistent, above 3.0,
with the exception of relatively poor performance of device H and
relatively good performance of device J.

Figure 12: OVRL ratings for Handheld Hands-free mode

The OVRL ratings for all devices in ST show some reduction over handset
mode, with more devices showing performance below 4.0 (devices A, B, G,
and I). The OVRL results for double talk have more variability, driven
primarily by the large variation in SIG scores.

*The correlation between sending only tests based on recorded
distortions and the perception in live conversation is not known
(*Recommendation *ITU-T P.831 \[24\]). Hence, the correlation of the
results from this listening test and the category classification needs
further study.*

### 4.3.2 Comparison of predictions from objective metrics to subjective double talk ratings

#### 4.3.2.1 Background and metrics

In TS 26.132 \[8\], computational methods are provided to compute the
categories and levels described in Clause 4.3.1.2.1 from real-speech
recordings from terminals. In this clause, the eight categories and
corresponding levels defined in Table 1 for echo canceller performance
are compared to the subjective ratings reported in Clause 4.3.1.2.2. In
addition to the categories and levels from TS 26.132 \[8\], two
additional metrics are considered. The first is found in Recommendation
ITU-T P.502, Amendment II \[16\], defining a method for computing the
attenuation in the sending direction under double-talk conditions,
A~s,DT~. The second is found in Recommendation ITU-T P.863 \[6\]. While
the application to impairments resulting from double-talk is not
explicitly within scope of P.863, it has been used for this purpose in
some instances.

#### 4.3.2.1.1 Method for P.863 computations

For P.863 computations, guidance from P.863.1 \[17\] was followed. The
four sentences of segment 2 of the double-talk test signal from TS
26.132 \[8\] were grouped sequentially into two sentence-pairs. The
reference signal for the P.863 NB mode was the full-band source,
filtered by a NB filter according to P.863.1 Table 3. The reference
signal for the P.863 SWB mode was the full band source, filtered by a
SWB filter according to P.863.1 Table 3. The validation tests defined in
P.863.1 Clause 8.8 were passed, with both sentence-pair references
scoring 4.50 for MOS-LQOn and 4.75 for MOS‑LQOw. For each test
condition, the P.863 scores MOS-LQOn and MOS-LQOw were computed using
the uplink measurements from that test condition, grouped into two
sentence-pairs. The MOS-LQOn and MOS-LQOw for the test condition are
reported as the average of the scores for each of the two sentence-pairs
from the measurements for that condition.

#### 4.3.2.2 Comparison of metrics to subjective SIG ratings

Table 2 contains summary values for the fit of the above-described
metrics to the SIG DT ratings for both HS and HHHF combined.

Table 2 reports the R^2^, correlation, rmse, and ANOVA results for the
Class (% frames) and Level (dB atten) according to the 3GPP analysis,
the Sending attenuation analysis A~s,DT~ of updated Appendix III of
P.502, and both MOS-LQOn and MOS-LQOw according to P.863.

These results show that the best single predictor of the SIG results for
both HS and HHHF taken together is the P.863 MOS-LQOn (correlation
0,994, rmse 0,189) followed by the 3GPP DT Class A1 (correlation 0,981,
rmse 0,256). Scatter plots are shown in Figures 13, 14, 15 and 16, where
filled symbols are for HHHF and open symbols are for HS.

Since several of the 3GPP metrics appear to have some predictive
capability, the analysis was extended to include the SIG ratings in
Single Talk (ST) as well. An optimal (in Akaike Information Criterion
sense) linear combination of the 3GPP metrics is compared to P.863
MOS-LQOn for the combined SIG ratings. The linear combination of Class
B, C, and D was AIC optimal (AIC=21,0098), with scatter plot and fit for
this model shown in Figure 17.

For P.863, linear fit (red line) and 3^rd^ order polynomial fit (green
line), according to Recommendation ITU-T P.1401 \[18\] are provided.
Details of the fits shown in Figures 17 and 18 are provided in Table 3.

The 3^rd^ order mapping of MOS-LQOn appears to provide the best overall
prediction of combined SIG ratings for combined ST and DT.

#### 4.3.2.3 Comparison of metrics to subjective BAK ratings

Table 4 contains summary values for the fit of the above-described
metrics to the BAK DT ratings.

![](media/image38.wmf){width="5.053472222222222in"
height="4.4944444444444445in"}

For BAK (intrusiveness of echo), the correlations reported here are
generally higher than in Recommendation ITU-T P.502, Amendment II
revised Appendix 3 as in that report, the analysis was restricted to
only HHHF, whereas the results in Table 4 include both HHHF and HS. As
there can be no echo in the ST condition, an AIC-optimal linear
combination of the 3GPP components was performed. Figure 19 shows
scatter plots and fits to this optimal combination (Class B and C) and
the P.863 MOS-LQOn.

Figure 19: Scatter plot, BAK DT by 3GPP (left) and P.863 MOS-LQOn
(right)

For P.863, linear fit (red line) and 3^rd^ order polynomial fit (green

shown in Figure 19 are provided in Table 5.

![](media/image41.wmf){width="4.809722222222222in"
height="0.9090277777777778in"}.

The 3^rd^ order mapping of MOS-LQOn appears to provide the best overall
prediction of combined BAK ratings for DT, in terms of correlation. The
rmse for the 3^rd^ order mapping is somewhat higher than the rmse for
the linear mapping.

#### 4.3.2.4 Comparison of metrics to subjective OVRL ratings

Table 6 contains summary values of the fit of the above-described
metrics to the OVRL DT ratings.

Table 6: Summary of model fits for OVRL DT

![](media/image42.wmf){width="4.8125in" height="4.28125in"}

For OVRL (overall listening quality), the correlations reported here are
generally slightly lower than those reported for SIG in Table 2, but
higher than those reported for BAK in Table 4. Values in Table 6 include
the R^2^, correlation, rmse, and ANOVA results for the Class (% frames)
and Level (dB atten) according to the 3GPP analysis, the Sending
attenuation analysis A~s,DT~ of updated Appendix3 of P.502, and both
MOS-LQOn and MOS-LQOw according to P.863, as for Tables 2 and 4.

Similar to results for SIG in Table 2, these results show that the best
single predictor of the OVRL results for both HS and HHHF taken together
is the P.863 MOS-LQOn (correlation 0.988, rmse 0.188) followed by the
3GPP DT Class A1 (correlation 0.964, rmse 0.324). As the scatter plots
for OVRL are generally similar to those shown above in Figures 13, 14,
15 and 16, they will not be included here, as very little additional
information is provided.

#### 4.3.2.5 Summary of comparison of metrics to subjective ratings for double-talk

Clause 4.3.2 compares subjective results for double talk to three
classes of metrics. For speech distortion, SIG, the best single-value
predictor among the set considered is the MOS-LQOn according to P.863,
with a 3^rd^ order polynomial remapping.

In contrast to SIG, for echo intrusiveness, BAK, the metrics
investigated here do not perform as well. This may be due to the
specifics of the UEs used, their echo behaviour, or it may be due to
spectral aspects of the echo signal that are not captured in the metrics
examined here. However, the best performing metric is again MOS-LQOn
according to P.863. The reasons for the superiority of MOS-LQOn over
MOS-LQOw are not examined herein.

Note that:

\- The evaluated 3GPP metrics (categories, attenuations) described in
Clause 4.3.2.1 were not designed to be quality predictors, rather they
are technical parameters that characterize the behaviour of echo
controllers.

\- The ITU-T metric described in Clause 4.3.2.1 is intended to predict
only the attenuation aspect of DT behaviour,

\- P.863 is not designed for predicting the subjective tests used here
(P.835).

\- The P.835 test methodology was not designed for echo evaluation

\- For practical reasons, the subjective evaluation used listening-only
experiments which does not include all aspects of a conversational
situation.

Nevertheless, the results presented are of interest when evaluating echo
controller related performance.

5 New Acoustic Tests 
====================

5.1 Time-variant user behaviour
-------------------------------

In current terminal testing specifications for handset mode, e.g.
according to TS 26.132 \[8\], only one default positioning of the device
is issued. The study presented in clause 5.3 considered multiple
positions of a DUT and identified critical test cases.

5.2 Additional UE usage environments
------------------------------------

The background noise simulation system according to ETSI ES 202 396-1
\[7\] is used for terminal testing in TS 26.132 \[8\]. Especially for
the handheld hands-free mode, the reproduction of the sound field method
may be inaccurate at the position of the DUT. For this reason, the
background noise playback system according to ETSI TS 103 224 \[14\] was
introduced here as an additional method. It provides an automated
equalization procedure. An example for the usage and comparison of this
reproduction system is given in clause 5.3.

Another UE usage environment for consideration in terminal testing
specifications are reverberant rooms. The upcoming specification
ETSI TS 103 557 \[22\] describes methods for the simulation of
reverberation in laboratories.

5.3 Results from a study on positional robustness tests and background noise simulations
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 5.3.1 General

Following current standards for acoustic handset testing, a mobile phone
is positioned according to \[12\]. The annex of \[12\] defines how to
position a handset for artificial ears of type 3.3 which should
correspond to typical human usage of a handset. It furthermore defines
how to select different positions.

This position does not cover all possible human holding positions of a
mobile phone handset today.

More extreme positioning are not covered by existing 3GPP
specifications. This clause presents an evaluation of an alternative
\"down position\". This position where the phone is tilted downwards
might be used by people when not really concentrating on positioning the
phone the proper way. Users may have little awareness of the impact on
speech quality when using the phone in this way since there is no
acoustical feedback in sending which would help them to relocate the
phone back in a proper position. In some cases the other party on the
call may provide feedback that the other user is hard to understand
which may indicate to re-position the phone. But this is not intuitively
understood by all users.

The positioning effects in sending are illustrated using analyses in
silence and in background noise situations. Additionally, two types of
background noise simulations are compared for the evaluation

### 5.3.2 Setup

#### **5.3.2.0 General**

A calibrated system consisting of HATS HMS II.3 (head and torso
simulator), MFE VI.1 (analogue/digital reference interface) and a 3G
radio tester (Rohde & Schwarz CMW 500 with analogue audio output / audio
board) according to Figure 20 was used. Four modern mobile phones from
four different manufacturers in wideband operational mode (AMR-WB, 12,65
kbit/s) were used. Table **7** provides some technical data on these
devices under test (DUT). It is not known if any device uses one, two or
more microphones e.g. for noise cancellation.

The DUT was mounted with *HEAD Handset Positioner* *IV* (HHP IV),

This mounting is named \"norm\" in the following clauses.

Figure 21b shows an alternative version of mounting. The handheld
positioner was set to the delta angles (A, B, C) = (45°, 0°, 5°) .
Additionally, a larger distance between mouth and DUT was simulated;
this was realized by shifting the device 1 cm higher than the default
mounting. This shift takes into account that the dimensions of HATS as
defined in \[15\] are felt to be too small compared to the head size of
many people today and such the distance from mouth to microphone and the
cheek shadow effect might not be properly taken into account in tests.
To some extent this shadowing effect can be compensated in sending by
shifting the DUT. In order to provide a better separation to the
existing positions, this new alternative position is named \"vertical\"
in the following clauses.

#### 5.3.2.2 Background Noise Systems

##### 5.3.2.2.0 General

For the generation of background noise during the measurements two
different simulation approaches were used: the new simulation technique
described in ETSI TS 103 224 \[14\] and the present industry standard
described in ETSI ES 202 396-1 \[7\]. Both systems were set up and
equalized in a small, mostly non-reverberant room (RT60 \< 100 ms). The
next two paragraphs summarize the properties of these two systems.

##### 5.3.2.2.1 Equalization process according to ETSI ES 202 396-1

![](media/image46.wmf){width="2.9472222222222224in" height="2.575in"}

Figure 22: Setup for equalization according to ETSI ES 202 396-1 \[7\]\
The green checkmarks show where the frequency response is correctly
equalized\
(note that only the magnitude is taken into account)

Figure 22 shows the setup used for the system described in ETSI ES 202
396-1 \[7\]. It uses four loudspeakers placed around the HATS and
additionally a subwoofer. The goal is that the frequency response of the
background noise corresponds between 50 Hz to 10 kHz at the two ears of
the HATS to the original recording.

Both left and right loudspeakers respectively are handled as a group and
one FIR-Filter is calculated for each side automatically. To compensate
for the crosstalk between both sides IIR filters are adjusted for each
side manually. It has to be emphasized that the phase of the signal is
not equalized and that in addition to that every loudspeaker introduces
an individual delay. This creates a more diffuse sound field in the
vicinity of the HATS.

With the equalized system binaural recordings can be played back and
used as background noise during measurements. When doing hands-free
measurements the system has to be equalized with the HATS and after that
the DUT has to be positioned at the position of the HATS.

The HEAD acoustics implementation *HEAD Automated Equalization for
Background Noise Simulation in Laboratories* (HAE-BGN) of the present
document was used for this evaluation.

##### 5.3.2.2.2 Equalization process according to ETSI TS 103 224

![](media/image47.wmf){width="2.9472222222222224in" height="2.575in"}

Figure 23: Setup for equalization according to ETSI TS 103 224 \[14\]\
The green checkmarks show where the frequency response is correctly
equalized\
(note that also the phase is taken into account up to a frequency of
about 2 kHz)

As it can be seen in Figure 23 eight loudspeakers are used for
generating the background noise. This system achieves a close-to-reality
simulation of the frequency responses of the background noise at a
minimum of eight positions around the HATS. For this purpose 64 FIR
filters are calculated automatically from the impulse responses between
every loudspeaker and every microphone (8x8). These filters also ensure
that the characteristics of the simulated sound field correspond to the
original situation also in-between the microphone positions up to 2 kHz
regarding magnitude and phase. The locations of the microphones are
selected such that a close to real sound field is generated close to the
HATS which makes the sound field less diffuse and brings it closer to
reality.

After equalization, recordings which were made using the same 8
positions can be reproduced. For hands-free measurements, the microphone
array has to be positioned at the position of the DUT in hands-free
position (cf. ETSI TS 103 224 \[14\]).

The HEAD acoustics implementation *HEAD 3-dimensional Playback of
Acoustic Sound Scenarios* (3PASS) of the present document was used for
this evaluation.

##### 5.3.2.2.3 Background noises

Four different background noises were selected for this evaluation:

\- Road noise (\~71 dBSPL(A))

\- Train Station (\~78 dBSPL(A))

\- Full-size Car 130 km/h (\~68 dBSPL(A))

\- Cafeteria noise (\~69 dBSPL(A))

Those background noises were recorded simultaneously with the microphone
array described in ETSI TS 103 224 \[14\] for handset setup as well as
for hands-free setup. In addition to that, a binaural recording was also
made for the system from ETSI ES 202 396-1 \[7\]. Thus the same noises
can be played back on both systems.

### 5.3.3 Measurement Results

#### 5.3.3.1 Measurements in Silence Condition

Figure 24 shows the frequency responses (1/12^th^ octave resolution) for
each device. The green curves indicate the transfer functions in normal
position, red curves were measured with the alternative vertical
position. Beside a constant offset for devices A-C, all devices show
issues in the upper frequency region (\> 2 kHz). Device D at least tries
to compensate the absolute level difference, the lower frequency content
almost matches in both positions.

Figure 24: Frequency Responses for different devices and positioning

**Table 8** shows some more typical metrics for measurements under
silence conditions for each device which can describe these differences
by single values:

\- Sending Loudness Rating (acc. to Recommendation ITU-T P. 79 \[19\])

\- TOSQA 2001 (WB mode, electrical recording)

\- POLQA according to Recommendation ITU-T P.863 \[6\], Version 2.4
(fixed active speech level of 73 dB SPL)

The absolute values are given in the column \"norm\", the difference to
the vertical position is given as \"vert. - norm.\".

  ------------------------- --------- ------- ------------- ------- ------------- ------- ------------- ------- -------------

All loudness ratings increase by at least 3,1 dB (up to 4.6), which is
mainly caused by the modified frequency responses shown in Figure 24.
The large differences in the spectral domain are not leading to huge
differences in the speech quality measures TOSQA and POLQA. In fact, all
MOS scores decrease for POLQA as well as for TOSQA when comparing normal
vs. vertical position. The maximum difference for POLQA is -0,24 for
Device C, whereas the largest difference for TOSQA is found for device B
(-0,37). Please note that the effect of decreased loudness is not
captured by TOSQA and POLQA, because a constant listening level of 73 dB
(A) SPL was set.

#### 5.3.3.2 Measurements with Ambient Noise

The following tables provide the results according to ETSI TS 103 106
\[5\] for each device and each positioning. Each MOS value is determined
as the average over 16 American English test sentences taken from annex
C of \[5\]. Note that MOS values as well as the calculated differences
are round to one decimal place.

![](media/image55.wmf){width="4.945138888888889in"
height="2.9319444444444445in"}

The decrease of S-/N-/G-MOS for the vertical position is observable for
all devices. The minimum and maximum differences between vertical and
normal position for each category is shown in Table **13**. In overall,
scores decreases at least by 0,1 and up to 1,0 MOS for S-, N- and G-MOS.

When using the two different background noise simulation systems very
similar scores are obtained for S-, N- and G‑MOS in the normal position
with a tendency to slightly bigger differences in the vertical position.
An exception here is device D. This device shows significant differences
between the playback systems, for both positions. N-MOS scores increase
up to 1,0 for the background noise simulation according to ETSI TS 103
224 \[14\]. Since the sound field reproduction system according to ETSI
TS 103 224 \[14\] provides an accurate sound field reproduction at the
location of the hand-held terminal (in contrast to an almost diffuse
noise field generated when using ETSI ES 202 396-1 \[7\] which does not
reproduce the physical characteristics of the real sound field at the
location of the terminal) it can be assumed that these results might
represent more accurately the \"real life\" behaviour of this device.

### 5.3.4 Summary

The study shows that degradations of device performance can be expected
when using different positioning as used in the study. The degradations
depend on device implementations. Different behaviour can be observed
for some devices with different background noise simulations.

5.4 Results from a study on objective measures with noise suppression and background noise
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 5.4.1 Comparison of P.862 to subjective results for noise suppression

Recommendation ITU-T P.862, *Perceptual Evaluation of Speech Quality*
(PESQ) \[1\], was published in 2001 to predict subjective scores as
obtained in Recommendation ITU-T P.800 Absolute Category Rating (ACR)
tests of Overall Speech Quality \[2\]. P.862 \[1\] is a very useful tool
for assessing the speech quality of devices in many situations; however
it has significant limitations for assessing speech quality when noise
suppression is used, primarily because the model was developed and
trained before modern UE noise suppression evolved. Since almost all
modern UE\'s contain some form of noise suppression algorithm, P.862
\[1\] should not be used for testing UE\'s in background noise as it
produces misleading results as demonstrated in the following clauses.

The inadequacy of P.862 \[1\] for devices incorporating noise
suppression is well documented. ITU-T Recommendation P.862.3 \[3\],
*Application Guide for Objective Quality Measurement Based on
Recommendations ITU-T P.862 \[1\], P.862.1 \[9\], and P.862.2 \[10\]*
provides unambiguous guidance regarding usage with noise suppression as
can be seen in the following excerpt \[p3-4\]:

![](media/image56.png){width="6.502777777777778in"
height="1.4916666666666667in"}![](media/image57.wmf){width="6.504166666666666in"
height="0.40069444444444446in"}

Figure 24a: See Figure 1 from ITU-T P.862.3 \[3\]

ITU-T Recommendation P.835 is used for subjective evaluation of systems
with noise suppression \[4\]. P.835 \[4\] evaluations use three rating
scales: SIG assessing the amount of speech distortion; BAK assessing the
degree of intrusiveness of any background noise; OVRL providing an
overall speech quality assessment. ETSI TS 103 106 \[5\] was designed
specifically to predict the three ratings from a P.835 \[4\] test and
was explicitly trained on noise reduction. In contrast, both P.862 \[1\]
and P.863 \[6\] were designed to predict results from P.800 \[2\]
listening tests, which only have one rating scale, overall speech
quality, MOS-LQS. In fact, P.835 \[4\] was developed partly in reaction
to a high degree of uncertainty observed in P.800 \[2\] tests on
conditions with noise reduction. Studies directly comparing P.800 \[2\]
MOS-LQS scores to P.835 \[4\] OVRL scores are predominantly proprietary,
but experience has shown that there is generally good correlation
between these two metrics.

An objective quality predictor is normally trained on a wide variety of
conditions, while a single subjective experiment includes a more limited
set of conditions which potentially changes the experimental context.
Therefore results from a specific subjective experiment may deviate from
objective predictions, hence the results below should be considered as
case studies, not as exhaustive and definitive results. However, these
case studies can be considered as indicative of the nature of issues
that could arise when predictors are applied outside their scope.

### 5.4.2 Experiment 1 - NB P.835 versus P.862.1

#### 5.4.2.1 Setup

In Experiment 1, a recording of American English speech consisting of
four sentences from each of two male and two female native talkers, as
used in ETSI TS 103 106 \[5\], was reproduced through an equalized HATS
artificial at 92,3 dB SPL active speech level at the MRP of HATS. The
background noise generation method described in ETSI ES 202 396‑1 \[7\]
was used to reproduce eight noises described in Table 2d of Clause 7.12
of 3GPP TS 26.132 \[8\]. Six handsets were used, denoted as A, B, C, D,
E, and F in the following plots. Each device was mounted on the HATS in
standard position and recordings made of clean speech, and speech mixed
with the eight noises described above, at the output of a UMTS
base-station simulator with AMR speech encoding at 12.2 kbit/s.

Recommendation ITU-T P.835 \[4\] is the recommended methodology for
assessing the listening quality of systems incorporating noise
suppression. A group of 32 naïve listeners, all native speakers of
American English, using the P.835 \[4\] methodology, rated all sentences
in all conditions in a partially balanced randomized blocks design,
resulting in 128 votes per condition. Results were used as training data
for ETSI TS 103 106 \[5\] with further details in Clause 7.2.1 of that
document.

For computing metrics, all recordings were taken at 48 kHz sample rate.
For P.862.1 \[9\], the clean source file was filtered to NB for use as
reference and the scores were computed separately on sentence pairs then
averaged to obtain per-condition values. For ETSI TS 103 106 \[5\], the
NB operational mode was selected and scores were computed on individual
sentences and then averaged to obtain per-condition values.

#### 5.4.2.2 Results

The results of this experiment are shown below, for four noise types.

![](media/image58.wmf){width="6.5in" height="3.886111111111111in"}

Figure 24b: Results of Experiment 1: comparing scores from P.835 \[4\]
and P.862.1 \[9\] in 4 noise types

It can be seen from these graphs that P.862.1 \[9\] significantly
underestimates the performance of the various handsets when compared to
the results obtained from the P.835 \[4\] test with human listeners. In
addition the crossing of the lines shows that the results obtained using
P.862.1 \[9\] do not preserve the rank order that is obtained with human
listeners. For example handset D is the top or almost top performing
handset for all noise types when human listeners are used, with a score
of fair to good, however when tested with P.862.1 \[9\], it is the 4^th^
or 5^th^ ranking handset in 3 of the noise types with a score of only
poor.

Figure 25 shows a scatter plot of the subjective P.835 \[4\] OVRL
ratings against objective scores. The red-coloured symbols are for
P.862.1 \[9\] while the blue-coloured symbols are for the GMOS output
from the P.835 \[4\] predictor of TS 103 106 \[5\]. As noted above, the
range of the P.862.1 \[9\] predictions is compressed relative to the
range of subjective ratings. For example, subjective ratings in the
range of 3.5, or mid-way between 3 \"Fair\" and 4 \"Good\" are predicted
by P.862.1 \[9\] in the region of 2 \"Poor\". In contrast, for GMOS, the
predicted scores span the full range of the subjective ratings, and fall
very close to the diagonal line of slope 1.

Spearman rank-order correlation, accounting for 95 % confidence
interval,\

### 5.4.3 Experiment 2 - Problems with tuning for P.862.1

#### 5.4.3.1 Setup

In Experiment 2, a recording of American English speech consisting of
four sentences from each of two male and two female native talkers, as
used in ETSI TS 103 106 \[5\], was reproduced through an equalized
artificial mouth. The active speech level was -1.7 dBPa at the MRP of
HATS. The background noise generation method described in ETSI
ES 202 396-1 \[7\] was used to reproduce eight noises described in Table
2d of Clause 7.12 of 3GPP TS 26.132 \[8\]. In this case, a single
handset was used, but with noise suppression parameters adjusted in two
ways. The tuning labelled \"Tuned for P.862.1\" was defined so as to
provide high values of Recommendation ITU-T P.862.1 \[9\]. The tuning
labelled \"Alternative Tuning\" was defined in general accordance with
the requirements of the marketplace, based on network operator
requirements. The device was mounted on the HATS in standard position,
and recordings made of clean speech, and speech mixed with the eight
noises described above, at the output of a UMTS base-station simulator
with AMR speech encoding at 12.2 kbit/s.

A group of 32 naïve listeners, all native speakers of American English,
using the Recommendation ITU-T P.835 \[4\] methodology, rated all
sentences in all conditions in a partially balanced randomized blocks
design, resulting in 128 votes per condition.

Figure 28: Results of Experiment 2 - P.835 \[4\] Background Score

The results for the overall performance in the P.835 \[4\] listening
test of figure 26 show that tuning an algorithm to get the best P.862.1
\[9\] score does not produce an optimum result. The version of the
algorithm tuned for P.862.1 \[9\] significantly underperforms in 6 of
the 9 noise types. The graphs in Figures 27 and 28 break down the
performance in terms of the signal and background noise scores. These
show that while tuning an algorithm to maximize the P.862.1 \[9\] score
slightly improves the perceived quality of the speech signal, Figure 27,
it significantly degrades the perception of the background noise signal,
figure 28, leading to the degraded overall score as shown Figure 26.

### 5.4.4 Experiment 3: WB P.835 v P.862.2, P.863 and TS 103 106

#### 5.4.4.1 Setup

The method used was very similar to the one described for narrow-band in
Clause 5.4.2.1. However, the UMTS base-station simulator was set to use
speech encoding with AMR-WB at 12.65 kbit/s.

For computing metrics, all recordings were taken at 48 kHz sample rate.
For P.862.2 \[10\] the clean source file was filtered to WB for use as
reference and the scores were computed separately on sentence pairs then
averaged to obtain per-condition values. For P.863 \[6\], version 2.4
was used; the clean source was filtered to SWB for use as reference and
the scores were computed using the SWB mode, separately on sentence
pairs then averaged to obtain per-condition values. For ETSI TS 103 106
\[5\], scores were computed on individual sentences and then averaged to
obtain per-condition values.

#### 5.4.4.2 WB Correlation Results

Figure 29 shows a scatter plot of the subjective P.835 OVRL \[4\]
ratings against objective scores. The red-coloured (+) symbols are for
P.862.2 (MOS-LQOw) \[10\], while the blue-coloured (x) symbols are for
the GMOS output from the P.835 \[4\] predictor of \[5\] and the
green-coloured (o) symbols are for P.863 Version 2.4 \[6\].

As for narrowband, the range of the P.862.2 \[10\] predictions is
compressed relative to the range of the subjective ratings. Subjective
ratings of about 3.5, or midway between \"Fair\" and \"Good\" are scored
by P.862.2 \[10\] at about 1.7, or below \"Poor\", and the RMSE is
1,659.

For P.863 \[6\] (MOS-LQOs), there is some compression and offset of the
predictions relative to the subjective ratings, but the compression is
not as severe as for P.862.2 \[10\]. Subjective ratings of about 3.5 are
predicted as about 2.0 by P.863, and the RMSE is 1.108.

The ETSI TS 103 106-WB \[5\] scores generally span the same range as the
subjective ratings, and fall close to the reference line, without the
compression observed in the P.862.2 \[10\] predictions. The RMSE is
0.196; however for some cases, particularly at lower scores, the error
can again be large. These larger errors are not unexpected, since during
the training phase of ETSI TS 103 106 \[5\] there was relatively little
data available with low scores.

#### 5.4.4.3 WB Rank Order Results

The graphs in figure 30 compare the scores of the various measures for
each of the six phones (A-F), in each noise type. Figure 31 then shows
the number of absolute rank order errors for each metric in each noise
type when compared to the results from the listening test. These results
do not take account of overlapping confidence intervals; hence the
errors may be exaggerated, especially for the clean condition where the
listening tests results were very similar.

For P.862.2 \[10\] the rank order is not preserved, again there are
frequent shifts of one and two positions, as well as shifts of three
positions in cafeteria and car noise. For P.863 \[6\] rank order errors
are observed, but not as many as for P.862.2 \[10\]. There are still
frequent single rank switches, but fewer two-rank switches, although
there are larger errors observed in the clean condition where the
confidence intervals overlap. TS 103 106 \[5\] has the best performance;
however single rank switches are still common and occasional two and
three-rank switches also occur in clean, cafeteria and pub noise.

### 5.4.5 Experiment 4 SWB P.835 v P.862.2, P.863 and TS 103 106

#### 5.4.5.1 Setup

The method used was similar to the one described in Clause 5.4.2.1.
However, the following differences should be noted. As commercial
super-wideband terminals are not generally available, a mock- up of a
handset was used. The mock-up was the size and shape of a typical mobile
handset, and was equipped with several microphones, as in some current
commercially available wideband terminals. The same speech and
background noise generation as for NB and WB was used, but recordings
were made from the microphones on the mock-up. The signals were
processed with offline processing to produce the noise-reduced signals.
No speech encoding was used.

For computing metrics, all recordings were taken at 48 kHz sample rate.
For P.862.2 \[10\], the source file was filtered to WB and the scores
were computed separately on sentence pairs then averaged to obtain
per-condition values. For P.863 \[6\] version 2.4 was used; the source
was filtered to SWB and the scores were computed separately on sentence
pairs then averaged to obtain per-condition values. For ETSI TS 103 106
\[5\], the source file was used as SWB and scores were computed on
individual sentences using the WB mode of the tool, and then averaged to
obtain per-condition values.

#### 5.4.5.2 SWB Correlation Results

Figure 32 shows a scatter plot of the subjective P.835 \[4\] OVRL
ratings against objective scores. The red-coloured (+) symbols are for
P.862.2 (MOS-LQOw) \[10\], while the blue-coloured (x) symbols are for
the GMOS output from the P.835 predictor of \[5\] and the green-coloured
(o) symbols are for P.863 (ITU-T P.863) V2.4 \[6\].

As expected the P.862.2 \[10\] results show a poor correlation with the
SWB listening scores with an RMSE of 1.458. SWB P.863 \[6\] scores are
more consistent and have an RMSE of 0.815, however they show a similar
compression of the range of scores as was observed for NB and WB. Also
as expected, the ETSI TS 103 106-WB \[5\] scores are less well
correlated in SWB than in WB with an RMSE of 0.345.

Maximum absolute error for P.862.2 \[10\] is 2,463, for P.863 \[6\] is
1,326,\
and for ETSI TS 103 106 \[5\] is 0,842. Spearman rank-order correlation,
accounting\
for 95 % confidence interval, for P.862.2 \[10\] is 0,755, for P.863
\[6\] is 0,855,\
and for ETSI TS 103 106 \[5\] is 0,956

#### 5.4.5.3 SWB Rank Order Results

The graphs in figure 33 compare the scores of the various measures for
the mock-up phones with various levels of noise suppression (0-15), in
each noise type. Figure 34 then shows the number of absolute rank order
errors for each metric in each noise type when compared to the results
from the listening test.

None of the objective measures preserve the rank order of the listening
tests for SWB. All three measures have frequent shifts of up to three
ranks and occasional larger shifts. P.863 \[6\] also commonly shifts by
four positions.

It can also be seen from the graphs in figure 33 that if these scores
were used to try and tune the noise suppression parameter in this
algorithm, different results would be obtained depending on which
objective measure was used, and in addition none of the measures would
reliably select the same optimization as that determined by the human
listeners.

### 5.4.6 Conclusions

The use of P.862.1 \[9\] and P.862.2 \[10\] for assessing the
performance of handsets in noise should be avoided. Almost all modern
UEs now provide noise suppression as part of their default operation and
it is shown that P.862.1 \[9\] and P.862.2 \[10\] produce misleading
results when used in conjunction with noise suppression algorithms.
Using P.862.1 \[9\] and P.862.2 \[10\] to compare UE\'s is unreliable
since a comparison of the results with actual listening tests shows a
different rank order between the two tests, i.e. the best P.862.1 \[9\]
and P.862.2 \[10\] score does not always produce the best overall score
from a listening test. The P.862.1 \[9\] and P.862.2 \[10\] scores
(MOS\_LQO) also substantially underpredict the P.835 \[4\] OVRL scores
obtained from the listening test. In addition, in Annex B of ETSI
EG 202 396‑3 \[11\], results for P.835 \[4\] listening tests are
compared to predictions from P.862.1 \[9\] and P.862.2 \[10\] and are
shown to not correlate well with the subjective results.

Finally, the use of P.862.1 \[9\] and P.862.2 \[10\] for comparing
handsets may steer manufacturers to tune their algorithms to maximize
the P.862.1 \[9\] and P.862.2 \[10\] score. For the reasons exposed,
such tuning may actually degrade the speech quality as perceived by
human listeners.

For WB it is not too surprising that the objective tools that are
intended to predict the perceived quality of telephone speech with noise
reduction (e.g. ETSI TS 103 106 \[5\]) perform that task better than
tools which were not initially designed to do so. However there is still
room for improvement, as even ETSI TS 103 106 \[5\] does not
consistently preserve the rank order, which can make comparative
evaluations unreliable.

For SWB none of the three predictors performed particularly well. Again
this is to be expected since P.862.2 \[10\] and ETSI TS 103 106 \[5\]
were not designed to be used on SWB speech, and P.863 \[6\] was not
designed for use with modern terminal noise suppression algorithms.

Further work has since been done to develop more effective objective
measures especially for wider bandwidths ETSI TS 103 281 \[20\]. It is
particularly important to ensure that maximum error and rank order are
taken into account as well as just RMSE, which would enable more
reliable comparative evaluations of solutions across a range of
operation scenarios including different background noises and noise
suppression technologies.

5.5 Validation results for combination of model A and B according to ETSI TS 103 281
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 5.5.1 Introduction

In ETSI TS 103 281 \[20\], two models for predicting results of ITU-T
P.835 \[4\] evaluations of the sending speech quality in noise are
described. Due to a desire by 3GPP SA4 to reference a single model in
3GPP TS 26.132 \[8\], a model consisting of the combination of the
predictions from Model A and Model B of \[20\] was proposed in \[8\].

Below are described the combination of the models and an analysis of the
performance of the combined model on three validation databases of
\[20\] based on the input from ETSI TC STQ.

### 5.5.2 Description of combination of model predictions

As defined in \[8\], the predictions from Model A and Model B of \[20\]
are combined as follows:

S-MOS-LQO~fb~ = (S-MOS-LQO~fb\_modelA~ + S-MOS-LQO~fb\_modelB~)/2

N-MOS-LQO~fb~ = (1.438\*N-MOS-LQO~fb\_modelA~ -- 1.959 +
N-MOS-LQO~fb\_modelB~)/2

G-MOS-LQO~fb~ = (G-MOS-LQO~fb\_modelA~ + G-MOS-LQO~fb\_modelB~)/2

Except for a linear post-mapping of N-MOS from Model A, the combination
is simply the average of the corresponding predictions from each Model.
The linear post-mapping of N-MOS from Model A was derived from
validation databases 3 (DES-25) and 4 (DES-26). Figure 35 shows a
scatter plot of unmapped model N-MOS predictions and subjective BAK
ratings for both databases separately. In addition, linear regression
lines are also shown separately for each database.

height="4.021527777777778in"}

Figure 35: Scatter plot of N-MOS from Model A versus subjective BAK
ratings for validation databases DES-25 and DES-26

Note that the scatter plots for both databases are nearly the same, as
are the linear regression lines. From this, it was proposed to combine
the results from both databases and compute a single regression line, as
shown in Figure 36.

height="4.054166666666666in"}

Figure 36: Scatter plot of N-MOS from Model A versus subjective BAK
ratings for combined validation databases DES-25 and DES-26

The regression equation obtained from the combined databases was then
used as post-mapping for the N-MOS predictions from Model A. Using the
combined model, comparisons to validation databases 3, 4, and 5 are
shown in the following clauses.

### 5.5.3 Validation database 3 (DES-25): Results for combined model

Results are shown as scatter plots, comparing instrumental predicted
ratings to subjective ratings. Results from the combined model on
validation database 3 for each of the three ratings, SIG, BAK, and OVRL,
are shown in Figure 37. For each rating (rows), two scatter plots are
shown, one before a monotonic mapping is applied (right column) and one
after a monotonic 3^rd^ order mapping is applied (left column).

The rmse\* and maximum absolute error\* (maxabs\*) after mapping are
shown on all figures, with and orange-coloured symbol indicating the
condition with the largest overall maximum absolute error. The mapping
polynomial is shown in the upper left corner of each panel. The dashed
green lines show error of ± 0.5 MOS. The error bars indicate the 95%
confidence interval before mapping (left column) and after mapping
(right column).

### 5.5.6 Conclusions

The provided data indicated that the combined model A and B performs
better than the individual models on their own. The results support the
use of the combined model in TS 26.132 \[8\].

6 Conclusions 
=============

The present document presented several further analyses and studies
related to the terminal testing specification TS 26.132 \[8\].

A large auditory evaluation was conducted to investigate the relation
between human perception and echo control characteristics (\"double talk
performance" according to clauses 7.11 and 8.11 of \[8\]). However, even
though extensive analyses on instrumental and auditory data were carried
out, adequate and reasonable requirements for TS 26.131 \[13\] could
still not be derived for this measurement method.

Clause 5 of the present document presented several studies regarding new
and/or advanced acoustic testing of terminals.

The usage of alternative and more challenging handset positions as well
as the background noise simulation system in ETSI TS 103 224 \[14\] were
evaluated for handset devices. Results on both methods are presented in
this document.

Another study investigated the usage of several speech quality
prediction models for noise-suppressed speech. Even though the methods
according to ITU-T P.862 \[9\] and P.862.2 \[10\] explicitly excluded
this application in their scope, they are widely used for this purpose.
The systematic score under-prediction of P.862.2 was analysed in ITU-T
SG12 and the incorrect transformation of the sound pressure level was
found as a reason of the bias; the Corrigendum in \[23\] improves the
performance. Substantial amounts of auditory tests were compared with
such metrics, concluding that they provide poor correlation with the
subjective data. Even the more recent speech quality prediction method
according ITU-T P.863 \[6\] does not perform well for noise-suppressed
speech.

The recently introduced method for assessing the quality of
noise-suppressed SWB/FB speech according to ETSI TS 103 281 provides two
models (A and B). In order to benefit from the performance of both
models, a combined approach is presented as a separate analysis here.
The data of two validation listening test databases indicate that the
performance of an average model performs better than the single ones and
confirms the usage of this approach in TS 26.132 \[8\]. Further terminal
investigations based on ETSI TS 103 281 is expected to provide the basis
for agreement on adequate and reasonable requirements/objectives for TS
26.131 \[13\].
