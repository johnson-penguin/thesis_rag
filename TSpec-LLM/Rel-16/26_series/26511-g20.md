3A Overview
===========

3A.1 Introduction
-----------------

This specification defines profiles, codecs and formats for 5G Media
Streaming. In this clause, the connection to 5G Media Streaming
Architecture in TS 26.501 \[5\] is introduced.

3A.2 Codecs and Formats in Downlink Media Streaming
---------------------------------------------------

### 3A.2.1 Architecture, Interfaces and APIs

According to TS 26.501 \[5\], Downlink Media Streaming provides the
ability for content to be distributed using procedures and protocols
defined by 5G Media Streaming as shown in Figure 3A.2.1-1. The detailed
procedures for the interfaces and APIs for 5G Media Streaming are
defined in TS 26.512 \[10\].

![](media/image3.wmf){width="5.924305555555556in" height="3.7375in"}

Figure 3A.2.1-1: Downlink 5G Media Streaming architecture

The present document primarily deals with the segment formats delivered
on M4d and the requirements applicable to the media playback platform
and content decryption module. According to Figure 3A.2.1-1, the Access
Client in the 5GMSd Client uses the manifest, typically the Media
Presentation Description (MPD) for Dynamic Streaming over HTTP (DASH) as
defined in ISO/IEC 23009-1 \[20\] and TS 26.247 \[21\] or the Master
Playlist for HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) as defined in IETF RFC 8216
\[22\] to download Segments to initiate a media playback session. A
5GMSd Application Provider may publish these segments directly through
M2d such that the 5GMSd AS acts as a hosting server but does not require
the media to be either transcoded or repackaged. Using these unified
formats maximizes cacheability and improves general Content Delivery
Network (CDN) operations, including usage of secure transport protocols
such as HTTPS on interface M4d.

5G Media Streaming segment formats are defined based on the Common Media
Application Format (CMAF) as specified in ISO/IEC 23000-19 \[7\]. By
using this format, 5G Media Streaming is compatible with a broad set of
segment-based streaming protocols including Dynamic Streaming over HTTP
(DASH) and HTTP Live Streaming (HLS). For example, ISO/IEC 23009-1
\[20\] defines a detailed DASH profile for delivering CMAF content
within a DASH Media Presentation using a converged format for segmented
media content.

Readers of the present document are encouraged to familiarize themselves
with terms defined in CMAF such as CMAF Headers, CMAF Fragments, CMAF
Tracks and CMAF Switching Sets. CMAF defines a content model for
adaptive playback of segmented media (enabling seamless switching across
tracks encoded from the same media) and late binding of tracks from
different media types, associated with the same presentation. CMAF also
defines a content protection and encryption framework for multi-DRM
support based on ISO/IEC 23001-7 \[8\]. Furthermore, CMAF defines media
profiles, i.e. encoding constraints on a CMAF track and its contained
media samples associated with a specific codec. This specification only
uses the structural constraints of CMAF as defined in clause 7 of
ISO/IEC 23000-19 \[7\] and in clause 8 of ISO/IEC 23000-19 \[7\] for
encrypted content. Specific 5GMS media profiles for video, audio and
subtitles based on the general constraints of ISO/IEC 23000-19 \[7\],
clauses 9, 10 and 11, respectively, are defined in the present document.
However, Downlink Media Streaming is not restricted to the media
profiles defined in the present document: any codec that defines a CMAF
media profile may be used and distributed with Downlink Media Streaming.

### 3A.2.2 Hypothetical Device Playback Model

The media playback platform is initiated and used by the Access Client
to create a streaming session and experience. The Access Client itself
handles the download of segmented media content via interface M4d. This
specification is based on a hypothetical playback model that permits an
5GMSd-Aware Application and/or a media Access Client to play back
segmented media content streamed via 5G Media Streaming for downlink.
Playback receiver requirements for CMAF content are defined in the CTA
WAVE Device Playback Specification \[9\] documenting how an Access
Client can use manifest information for establishing and performing
playback of CMAF content based on a CMAF Reference Player model.

Following the details in Figure 3A.2-1, playback functionalities
include:

> 1\) Querying the capabilities of the device to determine if it
> supports the playback of a specific media profile. Different means
> exist and are described in CTA-5003 \[9\], but minimally a
> well-defined MIME type and a well-defined codecs parameter following
> the requirements in RFC 6381 \[11\] is needed.
>
> 2\) Initializing the playback platform with the codec by providing
> appropriate initialization information. At minimum, a CMAF Header is
> needed for initializing the decoder. Initialization of content
> decryption, if needed, depends on the used DRM system.
>
> 3\) Playback itself, by appending data to source and track buffers and
> providing additional instructions such as seek, accelerated playback,
> random access, etc
>
> 4\) The ability to check the status of the playback platform, for
> example the size and duration of the media buffers, current playback
> time, etc. Relevant APIs exposed by the 5GMSd Client via M7d are
> defined in TS 26.512 \[21\].
>
> 5\) The ability to receive notifications and and error events from the
> playback platform, for example non-conforming content, buffer
> unde-runs, etc. Relevant APIs exposed by the 5GMSd Client via M7d are
> defined in TS 26.512 \[21\].

### 3A.2.3 Necessary Conditions for Codecs and Formats in 5GMSd

In order to use a media codec or a specific media profile of the codec
in the context of 5G Media Streaming, the following aspects need to be
defined:

> \- A CMAF media profile definition with all the requirements according
> to ISO/IEC 23000-19 \[7\] for a media profile.
>
> \- A definition of how capability discovery can be done, at the
> minimum a suitable and well-defined MIME type following the
> requirements in RFC 6381 \[11\], and in particular the definition of
> the codecs and profiles parameters.
>
> \- The mapping of media profile parameters to a DASH MPD. The mapping
> includes the static information (i.e. fixed parameters in the MPD) and
> dynamic information (e.g., depending on information in the CMAF
> Header).
>
> \- Potential requirements and restrictions for encrypted content.

This specification defines the above information for several media
codecs in clause 4, and provides requirements and recommendations for
the support of these media profiles in specific 5G Media Streaming
profiles in clause 5.

NOTE: Downlink Media Streaming is not restricted to the media profiles
defined in this specification: any CMAF media profile may be used and
distributed within Downlink Media Streaming as long as it can be used
with APIs and interfaces defined in TS 26.512 \[21\] and the above
information is provided.

3A.3 Codecs and Formats in Uplink Media Streaming
-------------------------------------------------

Codecs and formats for uplink streaming are defined in the remainder of
this specification.

4 5GMS codecs and formats capabilities
