Foreword
========

This Technical Specification has been produced by the 3^rd^ Generation
Partnership Project (3GPP).

The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work
within the TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the
TSG modify the contents of the present document, it will be re-released
by the TSG with an identifying change of release date and an increase in
version number as follows:

Version x.y.z

where:

x the first digit:

1 presented to TSG for information;

2 presented to TSG for approval;

3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.

y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e.
technical enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.

z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been
incorporated in the document.

Introduction
============

The present document specifies minimum performance requirements for the
acoustic characteristics of 3G, LTE, NR and WLAN terminals when used to
provide narrowband, wideband, super-wideband or fullband telephony.

The objective for narrowband services is to reach a quality as close as
possible to ITU-T standards for PSTN circuits. However, due to technical
and economic factors, there cannot be full compliance with the general
characteristics of international telephone connections and circuits
recommended by the ITU-T.

The performance requirements are specified in the main body of the text;
the test methods and considerations are described in TS 26.132.

1 Scope
=======

The present document is applicable to any terminal capable of supporting
narrowband, wideband, super-wideband or fullband telephony, either as a
stand-alone service or as the telephony component of a multimedia
service. The present document specifies minimum performance requirements
for the acoustic characteristics of 3G, LTE, NR and WLAN terminals when
used to provide narrowband, wideband, super-wideband or fullband
telephony.

The set of minimum performance requirements enables a guaranteed level
of speech quality while taking possible physical limits of the terminal
design into account. Some performance objectives are also defined, if
such design limits can be overcome. Care must be taken in applying
performance objectives in isolation, not to degrade overall end-user
speech quality.

3 Definitions, symbols and abbreviations
========================================

3.1 Definitions
---------------

For the purposes of the present document the terms *narrowband,
wideband,* *super-wideband* and *fullband* refer to signals associated
with the corresponding operating modes of the speech codecs specified in
TS 26.132.

For the purposes of the present document, the terms dB, dBr, dBm0, dBm0p
and dBA, shall be interpreted as defined in ITU-T Recommendation B.12
\[2\]; the term dBPa shall be interpreted as the sound pressure level
relative to 1 pascal expressed in dB (0 dBPa is equivalent to
94 dB SPL).

The overload point (maximum load capacity) is for the purposes of this
document defined as the RMS level of a digital representation of a
full-scale pure tone at the input of the speech encoder. The overload
point is defined at 3,14 dBm0 for AMR, AMR-WB and EVS speech codecs.

A 3GPP softphone is a telephony system running on a general purpose
computer or PDA complying with the 3GPP terminal acoustic requirements
(TS 26.131 and 26.132).

For the purposes of the present document the term *clock skew* is
defined as the difference between the clock of the device under test
(C~DUT~) and the clock of the reference client (C~REF~). The skew of
C~DUT~ relative to C~REF~ is defined in parts per million (PPM) as:
(C~DUT~ -C~REF~).10^6^/ C~REF~.

4 Interfaces
============

The interfaces required to define terminal acoustic characteristics are
shown in TS 26.132. These are the air interface and the point of
interconnect (POI). The interfaces are shown for one-channel (mono)
operation, interfaces for two-channel (stereo) operation is for further
study.

The Air Interfaces for GSM, 3G, LTE and NR are specified by GSM 05, 3GPP
45, 3GPP 25, 3GPP 36 and 3GPP 38 series specifications, and the Air
Interface for WLAN access to EPC is specified by WLAN access to EPC as
defined in TS 23.402 \[19\] and TS 24.302 \[20\]. MTSI speech aspects
are specified by TS 26.114 \[17\].

Measurements can be made using the system simulator (SS) described in TS
26.132.

The POI with the public switched telephone network (PSTN) is considered
to have a relative level of 0 dBr.

Five classes of acoustic interface are considered in this specification:

\- Handset UE including softphone UE used as a handset;

\- Headset UE including softphone UE used with headset;

\- Desktop-mounted hands-free UE including softphone UE with external
loudspeaker(s) used in hands-free mode;

\- Vehicle-mounted hands-free UE including softphone UE mounted in a
vehicle;

\- Hand-held hands-free UE including softphone UE with internal
loudspeaker(s) used in hands-free mode.

(See definition of softphone in Clause 3.1)

NOTE: The requirements and performance objectives for a softphone UE
shall be derived according to the following rules:

\- When using a softphone UE as a handset: requirements and performance
objectives shall correspond to handset mode.

\- When using a softphone UE with headset: requirements and performance
objectives shall correspond to headset mode.

\- When a softphone UE is mounted in a vehicle: requirements and
performance objectives shall correspond to vehicle-mounted handsfree
mode.

\- When using a softphone UE in hands-free mode:

\- When using internal loudspeaker(s), requirements and performance
objectives shall correspond to hand-held hands-free.

\- When using external loudspeaker(s), requirements and performance
objectives shall correspond to desktop-mounted hands-free.

5 Narrowband telephony transmission performance
===============================================

5.1 Applicability
-----------------

The performance requirements in this sub-clause shall apply when UE is
used to provide narrowband telephony, either as a stand-alone service,
or as part of a multimedia service.

5.2 Overall loss/loudness ratings
---------------------------------

### 5.2.1 General

An international connection involving a 3G, LTE, NR or WLAN network and
the PSTN should meet the overall loudness rating (OLR) limits in ITU-T
Recommendation G.111 \[4\]. The national parts of the connection should
therefore meet the send and receive loudness rating (SLR, RLR) limits in
ITU-T Recommendation G.121 \[5\].

For the case where digital routings are used to connect the 3G, LTE, NR
or WLAN network to the international chain of circuits, the SLR and RLR
of the national extension will be largely determined by the SLR and RLR
of the 3G, LTE, NR or WLAN network. The limits given below are
consistent with the national extension limits and long term objectives
in ITU-T Recommendation G.121 \[5\].

The SLR and RLR values for the 3G, LTE, NR or WLAN network apply up to
the POI. However, the main determining factors are the characteristics
of the UE, including the analogue to digital conversion (ADC) and
digital to analogue conversion (DAC). In practice, it is convenient to
specify loudness ratings to the Air Interface. For the normal case,
where the 3G, LTE, NR or WLAN network introduces no additional loss
between the Air Interface and the POI, the loudness ratings to the PSTN
boundary (POI) will be the same as the loudness ratings measured at the
Air Interface. However, in some cases loss adjustment may be needed for
interworking situations in individual countries.

### 5.2.2 Connections with handset UE

The nominal values of SLR/RLR to the POI shall be:

SLR = 8 ± 3 dB;

RLR = 2 ± 3 dB.

Where a user-controlled receiving volume control is provided, the RLR
shall meet the nominal value for at least one setting of the control.
When the control is set to maximum, the RLR shall not be ≤ (equal or
louder than) ‑13 dB.

With the volume control set to the minimum position the RLR shall not be
≥ (equal or quieter than) 18 dB.

Compliance shall be checked by the relevant tests described in TS
26.132.

### 5.2.2a Connections with handset UE in the presence of background noise

In the presence of background noise, the RLR at maximum volume control
shall not be ≤ (equal or louder than) ‑13 dB.

Compliance shall be checked by the relevant tests described in TS
26.132.

### 5.2.3 Connections with desktop and vehicle-mounted hands-free UE

The nominal values of SLR/RLR to/from the POI shall be:

SLR = 13 ± 4 dB;

RLR = 2 ± 4 dB (for vehicle-mounted hands-free UE);

RLR = 5 ± 4 dB (for desktop hands-free UE).

1\. For a vehicle-mounted hands-free UE:\
Where a user-controlled volume control is provided, the RLR shall meet
the nominal value for at least one setting of the control. It is
recommended that a volume control giving at least 15 dB increase from
the nominal RLR (louder) is provided for hands-free units intended to
work in the vehicle environment. This is to allow for the increased
acoustic noise level in a moving vehicle.\
RLR at the maximum volume control setting should be ≤ (equal or louder
than) -2 dB.

2\. For a desktop hands-free UE:\
Where a user-controlled volume control is provided, the RLR shall meet
the nominal value for at least one setting of the control. It is
recommended that a volume control giving at least 15 dB increase from
the nominal RLR (louder) is provided for hands-free units. This is to
allow for the increased acoustic noise level in the usage environment.\
RLR at the maximum volume control setting should be ≤ (equal or louder
than) 1 dB.

Compliance shall be checked by the relevant tests described in TS
26.132.

NOTE: The target value for nominal RLR, as recommended in ITU-T G.111
Annex B -- Table B.1 \[4\], lies between 1 and 3 dB. The higher RLR
requirement of 5 dB for desktop hands-free is appreciative of the
limitations in transducer output with current typical form factors.

### 5.2.4 Connections with hand-held hands-free UE

The nominal values of SLR/RLR to/from the POI shall be:

SLR = 13 ± 4 dB;

RLR = 9 +9 / -7 dB.

As a performance objective it is recommended that the RLR at the maximum
volume control setting is ≤ (equal or louder than) 2 dB.

Where a user-controlled volume control is provided, the RLR shall meet
the nominal value for at least one setting of the control. It is
recommended that a volume control range ≥ 15 dB be provided. Compliance
shall be checked by the relevant tests described in TS 26.132.

NOTE: The target value for nominal RLR, as recommended in ITU-T G.111
Annex B -- Table B.1 \[4\], lies between 1 and 3 dB. The higher RLR
requirement of 9 dB for hand-held hands-free is appreciative of the
limitations in transducer output with typical form factors.

### 5.2.5 Connections with headset UE

The nominal values of SLR/RLR to/from the POI shall be:

SLR = 8 ± 3 dB;

RLR = 2 ± 3 dB;

> RLR (binaural headset) = 8 ± 3 dB for each earphone.

Where a user-controlled receiving volume control is provided, the RLR
shall meet the nominal value for at least one setting of the control.
When the control is set to maximum, the RLR shall not be ≤ (equal or
louder than) -13 dB.

With the volume control set to the minimum position the RLR shall not be
≥ (equal or quieter than) 18 dB and shall not be ≥ (equal or quieter
than) 24 dB for a binaural headset.

Compliance shall be checked by the relevant tests described in 3GPP TS
26.132.

### 5.2.5a Connections with headset UE in the presence of background noise

In the presence of background noise, the RLR at maximum volume control
shall not be ≤ (equal or louder than) ‑13 dB.

Compliance shall be checked by the relevant tests described in TS
26.132.

5.3 Idle channel noise (handset and headset UE)
-----------------------------------------------

### 5.3.1 Sending

The maximum noise level produced by the apparatus at the output of the
SS under silent conditions in the sending direction shall be ≤
-64 dBm0p.

NOTE 1: This level includes the eventual noise contribution of an
acoustic echo canceller under the condition that no signal is received.

NOTE 2: This figure applies to the total noise level with psophometric
weighting. It is recommended that the level of single frequency
disturbances should be ≤ -74 dBm0p in the frequency range from 300 Hz to
3.4 kHz.

Compliance shall be checked by the relevant test described in TS 26.132.

### 5.3.2 Receiving

The maximum (acoustic) A-weighted noise level at the handset and headset
UE when no signal is applied to the input of the SS shall be as follows:

If no user-controlled receiving volume control is provided, or, if it is
provided, at the setting of the user-controlled receiving volume control
at which the RLR is equal to the nominal value, the noise measured at
the DRP with diffuse-field correction contributed by the receiving
equipment alone shall be ≤ -57 dBPa(A).

Where a volume control is provided, the measured noise shall be ≤
-54 dBPa(A) at the maximum setting of the volume control.

For the nominal volume control setting, the level of single frequency
disturbances should be ≤ ‑60 dBPa(A) in the frequency range from 100 Hz
to 10 kHz. As a performance objective it is recommended that the level
should be ≤ ‑64 dBPa(A).

NOTE: In a connection with the PSTN, noise conditions as described in
ITU-T Recommendation G.103 \[3\] can be expected at the input (POI) of
the 3G, LTE, NR or WLAN network. The characteristics of this noise may
be influenced by the speech transcoding process (for further study).

Compliance shall be checked by the relevant test described in 3GPP TS
26.132.

5.4 Sensitivity/frequency characteristics
-----------------------------------------

### 5.4.1 Handset and headset UE sending

The sensitivity/frequency characteristics shall be as follows:

The sending sensitivity frequency response, measured either from the
mouth reference point (MRP) to the digital interface or from the MRP to
the SS audio output (digital output of the reference speech decoder of
the SS), shall be within a mask, which can be drawn between the points
given in table 1. The mask is drawn with straight lines between the
breaking points in table 1 on a logarithmic (frequency) - linear (dB
sensitivity) scale.

### 5.4.2 Handset and headset UE receiving

The sensitivity/frequency characteristics shall be as follows:

The receiving sensitivity frequency response, measured either from the
digital interface to the DRP with diffuse-field correction or from the
SS audio input (analogue or digital input of the reference speech
encoder of the SS) to the DRP with diffuse-field correction shall be
within a mask, which can be drawn with straight lines between the

### 5.4.6 Hand-held hands-free UE receiving

The receiving sensitivity frequency response from the SS audio input
(analogue or digital input of the reference speech encoder of the SS) to
the free-field shall be as follows:

The receiving sensitivity frequency response shall be within the mask
which can be drawn with straight lines between the breaking points in
table 6 on a logarithmic (frequency) - linear (dB sensitivity) scale.

**Figure 6: Hand-held hands-free receiving sensitivity/frequency mask**

Compliance shall be checked by the relevant test described in TS 26.132.

5.5 Sidetone characteristics (handset and headset UE)
-----------------------------------------------------

### 5.5.1 Sidetone loss

The talker sidetone masking rating (STMR) shall be ≥ 15 dB and should be
≤ 23 dB for the nominal setting of the volume control. For all other
positions of the volume control, the STMR shall be ≥ 10 dB.

In case the STMR is below the lower limit also when the electrical
sidetone path has been disabled, the result shall not be regarded as a
failure.

Compliance shall be checked by the relevant test described in 3GPP TS
26.132. The bandwidth for the sidetone path provided by the UE may in
some terminals not be restricted to the narrowband range. In case the
sidetone path operates in a mode other than narrowband (to be declared
by the manufacturer), compliance shall be checked using the test
described for \"Wideband telephony transmission performance\".

NOTE 1: Where a user-controlled receiving volume control is provided, it
is recommended that the sidetone loss is independent of the volume
control setting.

NOTE 2: In general, it is recommended to provide a terminal sidetone
path for handset and headset UEs.

NOTE 3: In case the human air-conducted sidetone paths are obstructed
(one example being some binaural insert type headset UEs), it is
important to provide a terminal sidetone path.

NOTE 4: The STMR calculation algorithm being used was developed for
quantifying the audibility of the electrical sidetone path using a
sealed coupler. The air-conducted path was not intended to be included
in the test setup. A lower STMR limit was specified to avoid annoying
effects (e.g. howling, increase of ambient noise level in the ear) of an
excessive electrical sidetone. In HATS-based measurements, the
air-conducted path cannot be avoided in the test setup. With some UE
form factors the air-conducted path can be substantial resulting in low
STMR figures also when there are no annoying effects from any excessive
electrical sidetone. See ITU-T Recommendation P.76 for definitions of
sidetone paths.

### 5.5.2 Sidetone delay

The maximum sidetone delay should be ≤ 5 ms, measured in an echo-free
setup.

NOTE: The measured result is only applicable where the level of the
electrical sidetone is sufficiently high to be measured. While the STMR
value may indicate the presence of sidetone it should be ensured that
this is not primarily due to the acoustical or mechanical sidetone path
when interpreting sidetone delay results.

Compliance shall be checked by the relevant test described in TS 26.132.

5.6 Stability loss
------------------

The stability loss presented to the PSTN by the 3G, LTE, NR or WLAN
network at the POI should meet the principles of the requirements in
clauses 2 and 3 of ITU-T Recommendation G.122 \[6\]. These requirements
will be met if the attenuation between the digital input and digital
output at the POI is ≥ 6 dB at all frequencies in the range 200 Hz to
4 kHz under the worst case acoustic conditions at the UE (any acoustic
echo control should be enabled). For the normal case of digital
connection between the Air Interface and the POI, the stability
requirement can be applied at the Air Interface.

The worst case acoustic conditions will be as follows (with volume
control set to maximum for each following condition):

> **Handset UE:** the handset lying on, and the transducers facing, a
> hard surface with the ear-piece uncapped;
>
> **Headset UE:** for further study;
>
> **Hands-free UE:** no requirement other than echo loss.

NOTE: The test procedure must take into account the switching effects of
echo control and discontinuous transmission (DTX).

5.7 Acoustic echo control
-------------------------

### 5.7.1 General

The echo loss (EL) presented by the 3G, LTE, NR or WLAN network at the
POI should be sufficient during single-talk. This takes into account the
fact that the UE is likely to be used in connections with high
transmission delay and in a wide range of noise environments.\
See ITU-T Recommendation G.131 for general guidance.

The use of acoustic echo control is not mandated for 3G, LTE, NR or WLAN
networks and the connection between the UE and the POI is zero loss.
Therefore the acoustic echo control provided in the UE should provide a
sufficient TCLw at the POI over the likely range of acoustic end delays.

If acoustic echo control is provided by voice switching, comfort noise
should be injected. This comfort noise shall operate in the same way as
that used in DTX.

### 5.7.2 Acoustic echo control in desktop and vehicle-mounted hands-free UE

The TCLw for the desktop and vehicle-mounted hands-free UE shall be ≥
40 dB for any setting of the volume control.

The TCLw for the desktop hands-free and vehicle-mounted hands-free UE
shall be ≥ 46 dB when measured under free-field conditions at the
nominal setting of the volume control.

NOTE: A TCLw for the desktop hands-free and vehicle-mounted hands-free
UE of ≥ 55 dB is recommended as a performance objective when measured
under free-field conditions at the nominal setting of the volume
control. Depending on the UE idle channel noise in the sending
direction, it may not always be possible to measure an echo loss ≥ 55
dB.

The echo canceller should be designed to cope with the expected
reverberation and dispersion. In the case of the hands-free UE, this
reverberation and dispersion may be time variant. Compliance with this
requirement shall be checked by the relevant test described in TS
26.132.

### 5.7.3 Acoustic echo control in hand-held hands-free UE

The TCLw for hand-held hands-free UE shall be ≥ 40 dB for any setting of
the volume control.

The TCLw for hand-held hands-free UE shall be ≥ 46 dB at the nominal
setting of the volume control.

NOTE: A TCLw for the hand-held hands-free UE of ≥ 55 dB is recommended
as a performance objective when measured under free-field conditions at
the nominal setting of the volume control. Depending on the UE idle
channel noise in the sending direction, it may not always be possible to
measure an echo loss ≥ 55 dB.

The echo canceller should be designed to cope with the expected
reverberation and dispersion. In the case of the hands-free UE, this
reverberation and dispersion may be time variant. Compliance with this
requirement shall be checked by the relevant test described in TS
26.132.

### 5.7.4 Acoustic echo control in a handset UE

The TCLw for handset UE shall be ≥ 46 dB for any setting of the volume
control.

The TCLw for handset UE should be ≥ 55 dB at the nominal setting of the
volume control.

NOTE: It is recommended that the volume control should be set back to
nominal after each call unless TCLw ≥ 55 dB can also be maintained with
the maximum volume setting. Depending on the UE idle channel noise in
the sending direction, it may not always be possible to measure an echo
loss ≥ 55 dB.

The echo canceller should be capable of dealing with the variations in
handset positions when in normal use. The implications of this are under
study. Compliance with this requirement shall be checked by the relevant
test described in TS 26.132.

### 5.7.5 Acoustic echo control in a headset UE

The TCLw for headset UE shall be ≥ 46 dB for any setting of the volume
control.

The TCLw for headset UE should be ≥ 55 dB at the nominal setting of the
volume control.

NOTE: It is recommended that the volume control should be set back to
nominal after each call unless TCLw ≥ 55 dB can also be maintained with
the maximum volume setting. Depending on the UE idle channel noise in
the sending direction, it may not always be possible to measure an echo
loss ≥ 55 dB.

The echo canceller should be designed to cope with the expected
reverberation and dispersion.

Compliance with this requirement shall be checked by the relevant test
described in TS 26.132.

5.8 Distortion
--------------

### 5.8.1 Sending distortion

The sending part shall meet the following distortion requirements:

NOTE 1: Digital signal processing other than the transcoder itself is
included in this requirement (e.g. echo cancelling).

Distortion shall be measured between the MRP and the SS audio output
(output of the reference speech decoder of the SS). The ratio of
signal‑to‑total distortion power measured with the proper noise
weighting (see table 4 of ITU‑T Recommendation G.223) shall be above the
limits given in table 7.

Table 7: Limits for signal‑to‑total distortion ratio

+-------------------+--------------------+
| Sending level     | Sending Ratio (dB) |
|                   |                    |
| (dBPa at the MRP) |                    |
+-------------------+--------------------+
| 5                 | 30                 |
+-------------------+--------------------+
| 0                 | 35                 |
+-------------------+--------------------+
| -4,7              | 35                 |

+-------------------+--------------------+
| -15               | 30                 |
+-------------------+--------------------+
| -20               | 27                 |
+-------------------+--------------------+

Limits for intermediate levels are found by drawing straight lines
between the breaking points in table 7 on a linear (dB signal level) ‑
linear (dB ratio) scale.

Compliance of the sending distortion shall be checked by the test
described in TS 26.132.

NOTE 2: It should be ensured that the test signal is treated by speech
processing algorithms as a speech-like signal, and not a noise-like
signal. Test signals with a time-stationary envelope may be treated by
certain algorithms, e.g., noise suppression algorithms defined in 3GPP
TS 06.77 R99 \[16\], as a noise-like signal. If speech processing
algorithms, including but not limited to noise suppression algorithms,
are shown to treat the test signal as a noise-like signal, even where an
activation signal has been utilized, then the test should be repeated
with said speech processing algorithms disabled. The results of both
sets of tests and the state of the processing algorithms should be
documented in the test report.

### 5.8.2 Receiving

The receiving part between the SS audio input (input of the reference
speech encoder of the SS) and the applicable acoustic measurement point
(DRP with diffuse-field correction for handset and headset modes; free
field correction for hands-free modes) shall meet the requirements in
this clause at the nominal setting of the volume control:

The ratio of signal to total distortion power measured with the proper
noise weighting (see table 4 of ITU-T Recommendation G.223) shall be
above the limits given in table 8 when the sound pressure at the
applicable acoustic measurement point is up to 10 dBPa. For a sound
pressure ≥ 10 dBPa at the applicable acoustic measurement point there is
no distortion requirement.

Table 8: Limits for signal‑to‑total distortion ratio

+----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+

Limits for intermediate levels are found by drawing straight lines
between the breaking points in the table on a linear (dB signal level) ‑
linear (dB ratio) scale.

Compliance of the receiving distortion shall be checked by the
appropriate test method in TS 26.132.

NOTE 1: It should be ensured that the test signal is treated by speech
processing algorithms as a speech-like signal, and not a noise-like
signal. Test signals with a time-stationary envelope may be treated by
certain algorithms, e.g. noise suppression algorithms defined in 3GPP TS
06.77 R99 \[16\], as a noise-like signal. If speech processing
algorithms, including but not limited to noise suppression algorithms,
are shown to treat the test signal as a noise-like signal, even where an
activation signal has been utilized, then the test should be repeated
with said speech processing algorithms disabled. The results of both
sets of tests and the state of the processing algorithms should be
documented in the test report.

NOTE 2: Frequencies from 315 Hz to 816 Hz do not apply to the hands-free
UE case, only to handset and headset UE.

5.10 Information on other parameters (not normative)
----------------------------------------------------

Information about additional parameters relevant to speech quality,
e.g., for terminals where signal processing is used, can be found in
ITU-T Recommendations P.340, P.501 and P.502.

5.11 Sending performance in the presence of ambient noise
---------------------------------------------------------

### 5.11.1 General

For sending, in handset mode, the UE shall reduce the ambient noise
picked up by the microphone(s) without significantly degrading the
quality of the speech signal.

### 5.11.2 Connections with handset UE

The UE shall comply with the following requirements:

> S-MOS-LQOn

\- The average of S-MOS-LQOn scores across all test conditions shall be
≥ 3.0

\- As a performance objective, the average of the S-MOS-LQOn scores
across all test conditions should be ≥ 3.5

> N-MOS-LQOn

\- The average of the N-MOS-LQOn scores across all test conditions shall
be ≥ 2.3

\- As a performance objective, the average of N-MOS-LQOn scores across
all test conditions should be ≥ 3.0

> G-MOS-LQOn

\- No requirement.

Compliance shall be checked by the relevant tests described in 3GPP TS
26.132.

### 5.11.3 Connections with Handheld hands-free UE

It is recommended that the UE meets the following performance
objectives:

> S-MOS-LQOn

\- The average of S-MOS-LQOn scores across all five test conditions
should be ≥ 3.3

N-MOS-LQOn

\- The average of N-MOS-LQOn scores across all test conditions should be
≥ 2.2

> G-MOS-LQOn

\- No performance objective.

Compliance shall be checked by the relevant tests described in 3GPP TS
26.132.

5.12 Delay
----------

### 5.12.0 UE delay definition

For UMTS circuit-switched operation and MTSI-based speech with LTE, NR
or WLAN access, the UE delays in the send and receive directions are
defined as:

\- The UE delay in the send (uplink) direction is the delay between the
first acoustic event at the MRP to the last bit of the corresponding
speech frame at the UE antenna

\- The UE delay in the receive (downlink) direction is the delay between
the first bit of a speech frame at the UE antenna and the first acoustic
event at the DRP corresponding to that speech frame

NOTE: In order to harmonize UMTS and LTE delay definitions, the
reference points for UMTS UE delay have been changed in Rel-12. Prior to
Rel-12, the UE reference points for UMTS were implicitly defined by the
compensation factors declared by system simulator vendors, i.e. half of
the air interface delay was attributed to the UE, and the last acoustic
event at DRP was used for the receive measurement instead of the first.

Considering 10ms for half of the transmission time in each direction of
a UMTS call, a speech frame size of 20ms, a codec look-ahead of 5ms, and
a difference between the first and the last acoustic event of 20 ms, the
previous reference points took into account a UE implementation
independent delay of 2x10ms + 25 ms + 20 ms = 65 ms. The same UE delay
remains in the new definition above, which attributes the full air
interface delay to the UE but uses the first acoustic event at the DRP,
instead of the last (2x20ms + 25 ms + 0 ms = 65 ms). Hence, the UMTS
requirements with these new reference points remain the same.

### 5.12.1 Handset UE

It is in general desirable to minimize UE delays to ensure low enough
end-to-end delays and hence a good conversational experience, guidance
is found in ITU-T Recommendation G.114.

For UMTS circuit-switched AMR speech codec operation, the sum of the UE
delays in sending and receiving directions (T~S~ + T~R~) shall in any
case be ≤ 220ms and should be ≤ 185ms.

NOTE: A delay ≤ 185 ms might not be achievable in some cases due to UE
implementation trade-offs between delay and other parameters such as
speech quality enhancement, performance of noise reduction or UE power
consumption optimization, and UE implementation issues such as
rebuffering between components.

For MTSI-based speech-only with LTE, NR or WLAN access in error and
jitter free conditions and AMR speech codec operation, the sum of the UE
delays in sending and receiving directions (T~S~ + T~R~) should be ≤
150ms. *If this performance objective cannot be met, the sum of the UE
delays* in sending and receiving directions (T~S~ + T~R~) *shall in* any
case be ≤ 190ms.

For MTSI-based speech-only with LTE, NR or WLAN access in conditions
with simulated packet arrival time variations and packet loss and AMR
speech codec operation, the sum of the UE delays in sending and
receiving directions (T~S~ + T~R~) shall be less than or equal to the
delay requirements in Table 8bis, while meeting the speech quality
targets defined.

NOTE: The UE delay requirements for MTSI-based speech-only with LTE, NR
or WLAN access are derived from:

> \- A speech frame buffering and codec look-ahead of 25ms.
>
> \- An air interface transmission time of 1ms on receive and 1ms on the
> send direction.
>
> \- A budget allowance for a jitter buffer depth of 40ms for error and
> jitter free conditions and test conditions 0 and 1 of Table 8bis, and
> 80ms for test condition 2 of Table 8bis.
>
> \- A budget allowance for vendor specific implementation of 83ms
> corresponding to the performance objective and 123ms corresponding to
> the required maximum UE send and receive delay.

### 5.12.2 Headset UE

#### 5.12.2.1 Wired headset

It is in general desirable to minimize UE delays to ensure low enough
end-to-end delays and hence a good conversational experience, guidance
is found in ITU-T Recommendation G.114.

For UMTS circuit-switched AMR speech codec operation, the sum of the UE
delays in sending and receiving directions (T~S~ + T~R~) shall in any
case be ≤ 220ms and should be ≤ 185ms.

NOTE: A delay ≤ 185 ms might not be achievable in some cases due to UE
implementation trade-offs between delay and other parameters such as
speech quality enhancement, performance of noise reduction or UE power
consumption optimization, and UE implementation issues such as
rebuffering between components.

For MTSI-based speech-only with LTE, NR or WLAN access in error and
jitter free conditions and AMR speech codec operation, the sum of the UE
delays in sending and receiving directions (T~S~ + T~R~) should be ≤
150ms. *If this performance objective cannot be met, the sum of the UE
delays* in sending and receiving directions (T~S~ + T~R~) *shall in* any
case be ≤ 190ms.

For MTSI-based speech-only with LTE, NR or WLAN access in conditions
with simulated packet arrival time variations and packet loss and AMR
speech codec operation, the sum of the UE delays in sending and
receiving directions (T~S~ + T~R~) shall be less than or equal to the
delay requirements in Table 8ter, while meeting the speech quality
targets defined.

NOTE: The UE delay requirements for MTSI-based speech-only with LTE, NR
or WLAN access are derived from:

> \- A speech frame buffering and codec look-ahead of 25ms.
>
> \- An air interface transmission time of 1ms on receive and 1ms on the
> send direction.
>
> \- A budget allowance for a jitter buffer depth of 40ms for error and
> jitter free conditions and test conditions 0 and 1 of Table 8ter, and
> 80ms for test condition 2 of Table 8ter.
>
> *- A budget allowance for vendor specific implementation of 83ms
> corresponding to the performance objective and 123ms corresponding to
> the required maximum UE send and receive delay.*

WLAN access

#### 5.12.2.2 Wireless headset

For further study.

5.13 Echo control characteristics
---------------------------------

Echo cancellation is commonly deployed in the UE to fulfil the Acoustic
echo control requirements. Echo cancellers are complex devices of which
the subjective performance is affected by several attributes. The main
attribute is its ability to suppress echo. The process of suppressing
the echo may introduce impairments to the near-end speech signal, mainly
manifested as distortion or clipping of the near-end signal during
simultaneous speech from both the far and near-end (\"double-talk\").

To characterise the echo control performance, the activity (in % of
total time) and averaged level difference (in dB) of the duration of any
level difference according to Figure 6a and Table 8a between the clean
near-end signal and the send-signal shall be reported for
\"double-talk\" as well as the far-end single talk periods adjacent to
the \"double-talk\".

NOTE: The limits for specifying the categories in Figure 6a and Table 8a
are provisional pending further analysis and validation.

NOTE: The categories in Figure 6a and Table 8a are labelled in a
functional order and the subjective impression of the respective
categories is for further study.

All percentage values and averaged level differences described in the
relevant test of 3GPP TS 26.132 shall be reported.

  ---------- -----------------------------------------------
  Category   Description
  **A1**     Full-duplex and full transparency
  **A2**     Full-duplex with level loss in Tx
  **B**      Very short clipping
  **C**      Short clipping resulting in loss of syllables
  **D**      Clipping resulting in loss of words
  **E**      Very short residual echo
  **F**      Echo bursts

### 5.13.1 Handset

Requirements are for further study.

### 5.13.2 Headset

Requirements are for further study.

### 5.13.3 Handheld hands-free

Requirements are for further study.

### 5.13.4 Desktop and vehicle mounted hands-free

Requirements are for further study.

5.14 Clock accuracy
-------------------

For MTSI-based speech-only with LTE, NR or WLAN access, the clock skew
in send direction between the device under test and the reference client
should be less than 50 PPM (in absolute value) in error-free conditions.

Compliance shall be checked by the relevant test described in TS 26.132.

5.15 Jitter buffer management behaviour
---------------------------------------

For MTSI-based speech-only with LTE, NR or WLAN access, a jitter buffer
is used in receiving to handle the variation in packet receiver timing
(see clause 8 of TS 26.114 \[17\]).

If the jitter buffer management (JBM) behaviour is evaluated, the
following statistics shall be reported for conditions specified in TS
26.132:

\- Delay histogram (on a per sentence basis)

\- Quality loss histogram (on a per sentence pair basis)

and all measured delay and quality loss values for these conditions
shall be reported as a function of measurement time, together with
minimum and maximum values.

The relevant test is described in 3GPP TS 26.132.

6 Wideband telephony transmission performance
=============================================

6.1 Applicability
-----------------

The performance requirements in this clause shall apply when UE is used
to provide wideband telephony, either as a stand-alone service, or as
part of a multimedia service. The requirements in the clause apply only
when the far-end terminal is also providing wideband, and not narrowband
telephony. When a wideband-enabled terminal is providing narrowband
telephony, the requirements in clause 5, 'narrowband telephony
transmission performance' shall apply.

6.2 Overall loss/loudness ratings
---------------------------------

### 6.2.1 General

An international connection involving a 3G, LTE, NR or WLAN network and
the PSTN should meet the overall loudness rating (OLR) limits in ITU-T
Recommendation G.111 \[4\]. The national parts of the connection should
therefore meet the send and receive loudness rating (SLR, RLR) limits in
ITU-T Recommendation G.121 \[5\].

For the case where digital routings are used to connect the 3G, LTE, NR
or WLAN network to the international chain of circuits, the SLR and RLR
of the national extension will be largely determined by the SLR and RLR
of the 3G, LTE, NR or WLAN network. The limits given below are
consistent with the national extension limits and long term objectives
in ITU-T Recommendation G.121 \[5\].

The SLR and RLR values for the 3G, LTE, NR or WLAN network apply up to
the POI. However, the main determining factors are the characteristics
of the UE, including the analogue to digital conversion (ADC) and
digital to analogue conversion (DAC). In practice, it is convenient to
specify loudness ratings to the Air Interface. For the normal case,
where the 3G, LTE, NR or WLAN network introduces no additional loss
between the Air Interface and the POI, the loudness ratings to the PSTN
boundary (POI) will be the same as the loudness ratings measured at the
Air Interface. However, in some cases loss adjustment may be needed for
interworking situations in individual countries.

### 6.2.2 Connections with handset UE

The nominal values of SLR/RLR to the POI shall be:

SLR = 8 ± 3 dB;

RLR = 2 ± 3 dB.

Where a user-controlled receiving volume control is provided, the RLR
shall meet the nominal value for at least one setting of the control.
When the control is set to maximum, the RLR shall not be ≤ (equal or
louder than) -13 dB and shall not be ≥ (equal or quieter than) ‑3 dB.

With the volume control set to the minimum position the RLR shall not be
≥ (equal or quieter than) 18 dB.

Compliance shall be checked by the relevant tests described in TS
26.132.

### 6.2.2a Connections with handset UE in the presence of background noise

In the presence of background noise, the RLR at maximum volume control
shall not be ≤ (equal or louder than) ‑13 dB.

Compliance shall be checked by the relevant tests described in TS
26.132.

### 6.2.3 Connections with desktop and vehicle-mounted hands-free UE

The nominal values of SLR/RLR to/from the POI shall be:

SLR = 13 ± 4 dB;

RLR = 2 ± 4 dB (for vehicle-mounted hands-free UE);

RLR = 5 ± 4 dB (for desktop hands-free UE).

1\. For a vehicle-mounted hands-free UE:\
Where a user-controlled volume control is provided, the RLR shall meet
the nominal value for at least one setting of the control. It is
recommended that a volume control giving at least 15 dB increase from
the nominal RLR (louder) is provided for hands-free units intended to
work in the vehicle environment. This is to allow for the increased
acoustic noise level in a moving vehicle.\
RLR at the maximum volume control setting should be ≤ (equal or louder
than) -2 dB.

2\. For a desktop hands-free UE:\
Where a user-controlled volume control is provided, the RLR shall meet
the nominal value for at least one setting of the control. It is
recommended that a volume control giving at least 15 dB increase from
the nominal RLR (louder) is provided for hands-free units. This is to
allow for increased acoustic noise level in the usage environment.\
RLR at the maximum volume control setting should ≤ (equal or louder
than) 1 dB.

Compliance shall be checked by the relevant tests described in TS
26.132.

NOTE: The target value for nominal RLR, as recommended in ITU-T G.111
Annex B -- Table B.1 \[4\], lies between 1 and 3 dB. The higher RLR
requirement of 5 dB for desktop hands-free is appreciative of the
limitations in transducer output with current typical form factors.

### 6.2.4 Connections with hand-held hands-free UE

The nominal values of SLR/RLR to/from the POI shall be:

SLR = 13 ± 4 dB;

RLR = 9 +9/-7 dB.

Where a user-controlled volume control is provided, the RLR shall meet
the nominal value for at least one setting of the control.

The value of RLR at the maximum volume control shall be ≤ (equal or
louder than) 12 dB. As a performance objective it is recommended that
the RLR at the maximum volume control setting is ≤ (equal or louder
than) 2 dB.

Where a user-controlled volume control is provided, the RLR shall meet
the nominal value for at least one setting of the control. It is
recommended that a volume control range ≥ 15 dB be provided.

Compliance shall be checked by the relevant tests described in TS
26.132.

### 6.2.5 Connections with headset UE

The SLR and RLR should be measured and computed using methods given in
ITU-T Recommendation P.380 \[9\]. This Recommendation currently gives a
measuring technique for supra-aural earphone and insert type receivers.
Study is continuing on other types of ear-pieces in ITU-T Study Group
12.

The nominal values of SLR/RLR to/from the POI shall be:

SLR = 8 ± 3 dB;

RLR = 2 ± 3 dB;

RLR (binaural headset) = 8 ± 3 dB for each earphone.

Where a user-controlled receiving volume control is provided, the RLR
shall meet the nominal value for at least one setting of the control.
When the control is set to maximum, the RLR shall not be ≤ (equal or
louder than) -13 dB.

With the volume control set to the minimum position the RLR shall not be
≥ (equal or quieter than) 18 dB and shall not be ≥ (equal or quieter
than) 24 dB for a binaural headset.

Compliance shall be checked by the relevant tests described in 3GPP TS
26.132.

### 6.2.5a Connections with headset UE in the presence of background noise

In the presence of background noise, the RLR at maximum volume control
shall not be ≤ (equal or louder than) ‑13 dB.

Compliance shall be checked by the relevant tests described in TS
26.132.

6.3 Idle channel noise (handset and headset UE)
-----------------------------------------------

### 6.3.1 Sending

The maximum noise level produced by the apparatus at the output of the
SS under silent conditions in the sending direction shall not exceed
-64 dBm0(A).

NOTE 1: This level includes the eventual noise contribution of an
acoustic echo canceller under the condition that no signal is received.

NOTE 2: This figure applies to the total noise level with A-weighting.
It is recommended that the level of single frequency disturbances should
be ≤ -74 dBm0(A) in the frequency range from 100 Hz to 8 kHz.

Compliance shall be checked by the relevant test described in TS 26.132.

### 6.3.2 Receiving

The maximum (acoustic) noise level at the handset and headset UE when no
signal is transmitted to the input of the SS shall be as follows:

\- If no user-controlled receiving volume control is provided, or, if it
is provided, at the setting of the user-controlled receiving volume
control at which the RLR is equal to the nominal value, the noise
measured at the DRP with diffuse-field correction contributed by the
receiving equipment alone shall not exceed -57 dBPa(A).

\- Where a volume control is provided, the measured noise shall be ≤
-54 dBPa(A) at the maximum setting of the volume control.

For the nominal volume control setting, the level of single frequency
disturbances shall be ≤ ‑60 dBPa(A) in the frequency range from 100 Hz
to 10 kHz. As a performance objective it is recommended that the level
should be ≤ ‑64 dBPa(A).

NOTE: In a connection with the PSTN, noise conditions as described in
ITU-T Recommendation G.103 \[3\] can be expected at the input (POI) of
the 3G, LTE, NR or WLAN network. The characteristics of this noise may
be influenced by the speech transcoding process (for further study).

Compliance shall be checked by the relevant test described in TS 26.132.

6.4 Sensitivity/frequency characteristics
-----------------------------------------

In general it is recommended for all configurations to have a flat
sending frequency response.

### 6.4.1 Handset and headset UE sending

The sensitivity/frequency characteristics shall be as follows:

The sending sensitivity frequency response, measured either from the
mouth reference point (MRP) to the digital interface or from the MRP to
the SS audio output (digital output of the reference speech decoder of
the SS), shall be within a mask, which can be drawn between the points
given in table 9. The mask is drawn with straight lines between the
breaking points in table 1 on a logarithmic (frequency) - linear (dB
sensitivity) scale.

Compliance shall be checked by the relevant test described in TS 26.132.

### 6.4.2 Handset and headset UE receiving

The sensitivity/frequency characteristics shall be as follows:

The receiving sensitivity frequency response, measured either from the
digital interface to the DRP with diffuse-field correction or from the
SS audio input (analogue or digital input of the reference speech
encoder of the SS) to the DRP with diffuse-field correction, shall be
within a mask, which can be drawn with straight lines between the
breaking points in table 10 on a logarithmic (frequency) - linear (dB
sensitivity) scale.

**Figure 14.a: Performance objective for hand-held hands-free receiving
sensitivity/frequency mask**

Compliance shall be checked by the relevant test described in TS 26.132.

6.5 Sidetone characteristics (handset and headset UE)
-----------------------------------------------------

### 6.5.1 Sidetone loss

The talker sidetone masking rating (STMR) shall be ≥ 15 dB and should be
≤ 23 dB for the nominal setting of the volume control. For all other
positions of the volume control, the STMR shall be ≥ 10 dB.

In case the STMR is below the lower limit also when the electrical
sidetone path has been disabled, the result shall not be regarded as a
failure.

Compliance shall be checked by the relevant test described in TS 26.132.

NOTE 1: Where a user-controlled receiving volume control is provided, it
is recommended that the sidetone loss is independent of the volume
control setting.

NOTE 2: In general, it is recommended to provide a terminal sidetone
path for handset and headset UEs.

NOTE 3: In case the human air-conducted sidetone paths are obstructed
(one example being some binaural insert type headset UEs), it is
important to provide a terminal sidetone path.

NOTE 4: The STMR calculation algorithm being used was developed for
quantifying the audibility of the electrical sidetone path using a
sealed coupler. The air-conducted path was not intended to be included
in the test setup. A lower STMR limit was specified to avoid annoying
effects (e.g. howling, increase of ambient noise level in the ear) of an
excessive electrical sidetone. In HATS-based measurements, the
air-conducted path cannot be avoided in the test setup. With some UE
form factors the air-conducted path can be substantial resulting in low
STMR figures also when there are no annoying effects from any excessive
electrical sidetone. See ITU-T Recommendation P.76 for definitions of
sidetone paths.

### 6.5.2 Sidetone delay

The maximum sidetone delay shall be ≤ 5 ms, measured in an echo-free
setup.

NOTE: The measured result is only applicable where the level of the
electrical sidetone is sufficiently high to be measured. While the STMR
value may indicate the presence of sidetone it should be ensured that
this is not primarily due to the acoustical or mechanical sidetone path
when interpreting sidetone delay results.

Compliance shall be checked by the relevant test described in TS 26.132.

6.6 Stability loss
------------------

The stability loss presented to the PSTN by the 3G, LTE, NR or WLAN
network at the POI should meet the principles of the requirements in
clauses 2 and 3 of ITU-T Recommendation G.122 \[6\]. These requirements
will be met if the attenuation between the digital input and digital
output at the POI is ≥ 6 dB at all frequencies in the range 100 Hz to
8 kHz under the worst case acoustic conditions at the UE (any acoustic
echo control should be enabled). For the normal case of digital
connection between the Air Interface and the POI, the stability
requirement can be applied at the Air Interface.

The worst case acoustic conditions will be as follows (with volume
control set to maximum for each following condition):

> **Handset UE:** the handset lying on, and the transducers facing, a
> hard surface with the ear-piece uncapped;
>
> **Headset UE:** for further study;
>
> **Hands-free UE:** no requirement other than echo loss.

NOTE: The test procedure must take into account the switching effects of
echo control and discontinuous transmission (DTX) if applicable.

6.7 Acoustic echo control
-------------------------

### 6.7.1 General

The echo loss (EL) presented by the 3G, LTE, NR or WLAN network at the
POI should be sufficient during single-talk. This takes into account the
fact that the UE is likely to be used in connections with high
transmission delay and in a wide range of noise environments.

The use of acoustic echo control is not mandated for 3G, LTE, NR or WLAN
networks and the connection between the UE and the POI is zero loss.
Therefore the acoustic echo control provided in the UE should provide a
sufficient TCLw at the POI over the likely range of acoustic end delays.

If acoustic echo control is provided by voice switching, comfort noise
should be injected. This comfort noise shall operate in the same way as
that used in DTX.

### 6.7.2 Acoustic echo control in desktop and vehicle-mounted hands-free UE

The TCLw for the desktop and vehicle-mounted hands-free UE shall be ≥
40 dB for any setting of the volume control.

The TCLw for the desktop hands-free and vehicle-mounted hands-free UE
shall be ≥ 46 dB when measured under free-field conditions at the
nominal setting of the volume control.

NOTE: A TCLw for desktop hands-free and vehicle-mounted hands-free UE of
≥ 55 dB is recommended as a performance objective when measured under
free-field conditions at the nominal setting of the volume control.
Depending on the UE idle channel noise in the sending direction, it may
not always be possible to measure an echo loss ≥ 55 dB.

The echo canceller should be designed to cope with the expected
reverberation and dispersion. In the case of the hands-free UE, this
reverberation and dispersion may be time variant. Compliance with this
requirement shall be checked by the relevant test described in TS
26.132.

### 6.7.3 Acoustic echo control in hand-held hands-free UE

The TCLw for hand-held hands-free UE shall be ≥ 40 dB for any setting of
the volume control.

The TCLw for hand-held hands-free UE shall be ≥ 46 dB at the nominal
setting of the volume control.

NOTE: A TCLw for the hand-held hands-free UE of ≥ 55 dB is recommended
as a performance objective when measured under free-field conditions at
the nominal setting of the volume control. Depending on the UE idle
channel noise in the sending direction, it may not always be possible to
measure an echo loss ≥ 55 dB.

The echo canceller should be designed to cope with the expected
reverberation and dispersion. In the case of the hands-free UE, this
reverberation and dispersion may be time variant. Compliance with this
requirement shall be checked by the relevant test described in TS
26.132.

### 6.7.4 Acoustic echo control in a handset UE

The TCLw for handset UE shall be ≥ 46 dB for any setting of the volume
control.

The TCLw for handset UE should be ≥ 55 dB at the nominal setting of the
volume control.

With the volume control set to maximum TCLw should be ≥55 dB.

It is recommended that the volume control should be set back to nominal
after each call unless TCLw ≥ 55 dB can also be maintained with the
maximum volume setting.

> NOTE. Depending on the UE idle channel noise in the sending direction,
> it may not always be possible to measure an echo loss ≥ 55 dB.

The echo canceller should be capable of dealing with the variations in
handset positions when in normal use. The implications of this are under
study.

Compliance with this requirement shall be checked by the relevant test
described in TS 26.132.

### 6.7.5 Acoustic echo control in a headset UE

The TCLw for headset UE shall be ≥ 46 dB for any setting of the volume
control.

The TCLw for headset UE shall be ≥ 55 dB at the nominal setting of the
volume control.

The volume control shall be set back to nominal after each call unless a
TCLw ≥ 55 dB can also be maintained with the maximum volume setting.

> NOTE: Depending on the UE idle channel noise in the sending direction,
> it may not always be possible to measure an echo loss ≥ 55 dB.

Due to the obstacle effect of the head in this type of terminal, careful
design might mean that no active echo control is necessary.

The echo cancellation algorithm should be designed to cope with the
expected reverberation and dispersion.

Compliance with this requirement shall be checked by the relevant test
described in TS 26.132.

6.8 Distortion
--------------

### 6.8.1 Sending distortion

The sending part shall meet the following distortion requirements:

NOTE 1: Digital signal processing other than the transcoder itself is
included in this requirement (e.g., echo cancelling).

Distortion shall be measured between the MRP and the SS audio output
(output of the reference speech decoder of the SS). The ratio of
signal‑to‑total distortion power measured with the proper noise
weighting (see table 4 of ITU‑T Recommendation G.223) shall be above the
limits given in table 15.

NOTE 2: Frequencies from 315 Hz to 816 Hz do not apply to the hands-free
UE case, but only to handset and headset UE.

Table 15: Limits for signal‑to‑total distortion ratio

+----------------+-------------------+--------------------+
| Frequency (Hz) | Sending level     | Sending Ratio (dB) |
|                |                   |                    |

Limits for intermediate levels are found by drawing straight lines
between the breaking points in table 15 on a linear (dB signal level) ‑
linear (dB ratio) scale.

Compliance of the sending distortion shall be checked by the test
described in TS 26.132.

NOTE 3: It should be ensured that the test signal is treated by speech
processing algorithms as a speech-like signal, and not a noise-like
signal. Test signals with a time-stationary envelope may be treated by
certain algorithms, e.g., noise suppression algorithms defined in 3GPP
TS 06.77 R99 \[16\], as a noise-like signal. If speech processing
algorithms, including but not limited to noise suppression algorithms,
are shown to treat the test signal as a noise-like signal, even where an
activation signal has been utilized, then the test should be repeated
with said speech processing algorithms disabled. The results of both
sets of tests and the state of the processing algorithms should be
documented in the test report.

### 6.8.2 Receiving

The receiving part between the SS audio input (input of the reference
speech encoder of the SS) and the applicable acoustic measurement point
(DRP with diffuse-field correction for handset and headset modes; free
field correction for hands-free modes) shall meet the requirements in
this clause at the nominal setting of the volume control (except where
another volume setting is specified):

The ratio of signal to total distortion power measured with the proper
noise weighting (see table 4 of ITU-T Recommendation G.223) shall be
above the limits given in table 16 when the sound pressure at the
applicable acoustic measurement point is \< 10 dBPa. For a sound
pressure ≥ 10 dBPa at the applicable acoustic measurement point there is
no distortion requirement.

NOTE 1: Frequencies from 315 Hz to 816 Hz do not apply to the hands-free
UE case, only to handset and headset UE.

> N-MOS-LQOw

\- The average of the N-MOS-LQOw scores across all test conditions shall
be ≥ 2.3

\- As a performance objective, the average of N-MOS-LQOw scores across

> S-MOS-LQOw

\- The average of S-MOS-LQOw scores across all five test conditions
should be ≥ 3.4

N-MOS-LQOw

\- The average of N-MOS-LQOw scores across all test conditions should be
≥ 2.3

6.11 Delay
----------

### 6.11.0 UE delay definition

For UMTS circuit-switched operation and MTSI-based speech with LTE, NR
or WLAN access, the UE delays in the send and receive directions are
defined as:

\- The UE delay in the send (uplink) direction is the delay between the
first acoustic event at the MRP to the last bit of the corresponding
speech frame at the UE antenna

\- The UE delay in the receive (downlink) direction is the delay between
the first bit of a speech frame at the UE antenna and the first acoustic
event at the DRP corresponding to that speech frame

NOTE: In order to harmonize UMTS and LTE delay definitions, the
reference points for UMTS UE delay have been changed in Rel-12. Prior to
Rel-12, the UE reference points for UMTS were implicitly defined by the
compensation factors declared by system simulator vendors, i.e. half of
the air interface delay was attributed to the UE, and the last acoustic
event at DRP was used for the receive measurement instead of the first.

Considering 10ms for half of the transmission time in each direction of
a UMTS call, a speech frame size of 20ms, a codec look-ahead of 5ms, and
a difference between the first and the last acoustic event of 20 ms, the
previous reference points took into account a UE implementation
independent delay of 2x10ms + 25 ms + 20 ms = 65 ms. The same UE delay
remains in the new definition above, which attributes the full air
interface delay to the UE but uses the first acoustic event at the DRP,
instead of the last (2x20ms + 25 ms + 0 ms = 65 ms). Hence, the UMTS
requirements with these new reference points remain the same.

### 6.11.1 Handset UE

It is in general desirable to minimize UE delays to ensure low enough
end-to-end delays and hence a good conversational experience, guidance
is found in ITU-T Recommendation G.114.

For UMTS circuit-switched AMR-WB speech codec operation, the sum of the
UE delays in sending and receiving directions (T~S~ + T~R~) shall in any
case be ≤ 220ms and should be ≤ 185ms.

NOTE: A delay ≤ 185 ms might not be achievable in some cases due to UE
implementation trade-offs between delay and other parameters such as
speech quality enhancement, performance of noise reduction or UE power
consumption optimization, and UE implementation issues such as
rebuffering between components.

For MTSI-based speech-only with LTE, NR or WLAN access in error and
jitter free conditions and AMR-WB speech codec operation, the sum of the
UE delays in sending and receiving directions (T~S~ + T~R~) should be ≤
150ms. *If this performance objective cannot be met, the sum of the UE
delays* in sending and receiving directions (T~S~ + T~R~) *shall in* any
case be ≤ 190ms.

For MTSI-based speech-only with LTE, NR or WLAN access in conditions
with simulated packet arrival time variations and packet loss and AMR-WB
speech codec operation, the sum of the UE delays in sending and
receiving directions (T~S~ + T~R~) shall be less than or equal to the
delay requirements in Table 16a1, while meeting the speech quality
targets defined.

NOTE: The UE delay requirements for MTSI-based speech-only with LTE, NR
or WLAN access are derived from:

\- A speech frame buffering and codec look-ahead of 25ms.

\- An air interface transmission time of 1ms on receive and 1ms on the
send direction.

\- A budget allowance for a jitter buffer depth of 40ms for error and
jitter free conditions and test conditions 0 and 1 of Table 16a1, and
80ms for test condition 2 of Table 16a1.

*- A budget allowance for vendor specific implementation of 83ms
corresponding to the performance objective and 123ms corresponding to
the required maximum UE send and receive delay.*

WLAN access

### 6.11.2 Headset UE

#### 6.11.2.1 Wired headset

It is in general desirable to minimize UE delays to ensure low enough
end-to-end delays and hence a good conversational experience, guidance
is found in ITU-T Recommendation G.114.

For UMTS circuit-switched AMR-WB speech codec operation, the sum of the
UE delays in sending and receiving directions (T~S~ + T~R~) shall in any
case be ≤ 220ms and should be ≤ 185ms.

NOTE: A delay ≤ 185 ms might not be achievable in some cases due to UE
implementation trade-offs between delay and other parameters such as
speech quality enhancement, performance of noise reduction or UE power
consumption optimization, and UE implementation issues such as
rebuffering between components.

For MTSI-based speech-only with LTE, NR or WLAN access in error and
jitter free conditions and AMR-WB speech codec operation, the sum of the
UE delays in sending and receiving directions (T~S~ + T~R~) should be ≤
150ms. *If this performance objective cannot be met, the sum of the UE
delays* in sending and receiving directions (T~S~ + T~R~) *shall in* any
case be ≤ 190ms.

For MTSI-based speech-only with LTE, NR or WLAN access in conditions
with simulated packet arrival time variations and packet loss and AMR-WB
speech codec operation, the sum of the UE delays in sending and
receiving directions (T~S~ + T~R~) shall be less than or equal to the
delay requirements in Table 16a2, while meeting the speech quality
targets defined.

NOTE: The UE delay requirements for MTSI-based speech-only with LTE, NR
or WLAN access are derived from:

\- A speech frame buffering and codec look-ahead of 25ms.

\- An air interface transmission time of 1ms on receive and 1ms on the
send direction.

\- A budget allowance for a jitter buffer depth of 40ms for error and
jitter free conditions and test conditions 0 and 1 of Table 16a2, and
80ms for test condition 2 of Table 16a2.

*- A budget allowance for vendor specific implementation of 83ms
corresponding to the performance objective and 123ms corresponding to
the required maximum UE send and receive delay.*

WLAN access

Echo cancellation is commonly deployed in the UE to fulfil the Acoustic
echo control requirements. Echo cancellers are complex devices of which
the subjective performance is affected by several attributes. The main
attribute is its ability to suppress echo. The process of suppressing
the echo may introduce impairments to the near-end speech signal, mainly
manifested as distortion or clipping of the near-end signal during
simultaneous speech from both the far and near-end (\"double-talk\").

To characterise the echo control performance, the activity (in % of
total time) and averaged level difference (in dB) of the duration of any
level difference according to Figure 14b and Table 16b between the clean
near-end signal and the send-signal shall be reported for
\"double-talk\" as well as the far-end single talk periods adjacent to
the \"double-talk\".

NOTE: The limits for specifying the categories in Figure 14b and Table
16b are provisional pending further analysis and validation.

NOTE: The categories in Figure 14b and Table 16b are labelled in a
functional order and the subjective impression of the respective
categories is for further study.

All percentage values and averaged level differences described in the
relevant test of 3GPP TS 26.132 shall be reported.

### 6.12.1 Handset

Requirements are for further study.

### 6.12.2 Headset

Requirements are for further study.

### 6.12.3 Handheld hands-free

Requirements are for further study.

### 6.12.4 Desktop and vehicle mounted hands-free

Requirements are for further study.

6.13 Clock accuracy
-------------------

For MTSI-based speech-only with LTE, NR or WLAN access, the clock skew
in send direction between the device under test and the reference client
should be less than 50 PPM (in absolute value) in error-free conditions.

Compliance shall be checked by the relevant test described in TS 26.132.

6.14 Jitter buffer management behaviour
---------------------------------------

For MTSI-based speech-only with LTE, NR or WLAN access, a jitter buffer
is used in receiving to handle the variation in packet receiver timing
(see clause 8 of TS 26.114 \[17\]).

If the jitter buffer management (JBM) behaviour is evaluated, the
following statistics shall be reported for conditions specified in TS
26.132:

\- Delay histogram (on a per sentence basis)

\- Quality loss histogram (on a per sentence pair basis)

and all measured delay and quality loss values for these conditions
shall be reported as a function of measurement time, together with
minimum and maximum values.

The relevant test is described in 3GPP TS 26.132.

7 Super-wideband telephony transmission performance
===================================================

7.1 Applicability
-----------------

The performance requirements in this clause shall apply when a UE is
used to provide super-wideband telephony, either as a stand-alone
service, or as part of a multimedia service. The requirements in the
clause apply only when the far-end terminal is also providing
super-wideband telephony. When a super-wideband-enabled terminal is
providing narrowband telephony, the requirements in clause 5,
'narrowband telephony transmission performance' shall apply. When a
super-wideband-enabled terminal is providing wideband telephony, the
requirements in clause 6, 'Wideband telephony transmission performance'
shall apply.

7.2 Overall loss/loudness ratings
---------------------------------

### 7.2.1 General

An international connection involving a 3G, LTE, NR or WLAN network and
the PSTN should meet the overall loudness rating (OLR) limits in ITU-T
Recommendation G.111 \[4\]. The national parts of the connection should
therefore meet the send and receive loudness rating (SLR, RLR) limits in
ITU-T Recommendation G.121 \[5\].

For the case where digital routings are used to connect the 3G, LTE, NR
or WLAN network to the international chain of circuits, the SLR and RLR
of the national extension will be largely determined by the SLR and RLR
of the 3G, LTE, NR or WLAN network. The limits given below are
consistent with the national extension limits and long term objectives
in ITU-T Recommendation G.121 \[5\].

The SLR and RLR values for the 3G, LTE, NR or WLAN network apply up to
the POI. However, the main determining factors are the characteristics
of the UE, including the analogue to digital conversion (ADC) and
digital to analogue conversion (DAC). In practice, it is convenient to
specify loudness ratings to the Air Interface. For the normal case,
where the 3G, LTE, NR or WLAN network introduces no additional loss
between the Air Interface and the POI, the loudness ratings to the PSTN
boundary (POI) will be the same as the loudness ratings measured at the
Air Interface. However, in some cases loss adjustment may be needed for
interworking situations in individual countries.

### 7.2.2 Connections with handset UE

The nominal values of SLR/RLR to the POI shall be:

SLR = 8 ± 3 dB;

RLR = 2 ± 3 dB.

Where a user-controlled receiving volume control is provided, the RLR
shall meet the nominal value for at least one setting of the control.
When the control is set to maximum, the RLR shall not be ≤ (equal or
louder than) -13 dB and shall not be ≥ (equal or quieter than) ‑3 dB.

With the volume control set to the minimum position the RLR shall not be
≥ (equal or quieter than) 18 dB.

Compliance shall be checked by the relevant tests described in TS
26.132.

### 7.2.2a Connections with handset UE in the presence of background noise

In the presence of background noise, the RLR at maximum volume control
shall not be ≤ (equal or louder than) ‑13 dB.

Compliance shall be checked by the relevant tests described in TS
26.132.

### 7.2.3 Connections with desktop and vehicle-mounted hands-free UE

The nominal values of SLR/RLR to/from the POI shall be:

SLR = 13 ± 4 dB;

RLR = 2 ± 4 dB (for vehicle-mounted hands-free UE);

RLR = 5 ± 4 dB (for desktop hands-free UE).

1\. For a vehicle-mounted hands-free UE:\
Where a user-controlled volume control is provided, the RLR shall meet
the nominal value for at least one setting of the control. It is
recommended that a volume control giving at least 15 dB increase from
the nominal RLR (louder) is provided for hands-free units intended to
work in the vehicle environment. This is to allow for the increased
acoustic noise level in a moving vehicle.\
RLR at the maximum volume control setting should be ≤ (equal or louder
than) -2 dB.

2\. For a desktop hands-free UE:\
Where a user-controlled volume control is provided, the RLR shall meet
the nominal value for at least one setting of the control. It is
recommended that a volume control giving at least 15 dB increase from
the nominal RLR (louder) is provided for hands-free units. This is to
allow for increased acoustic noise level in the usage environment.\
RLR at the maximum volume control setting should ≤ (equal or louder
than) 1 dB.

Compliance shall be checked by the relevant tests described in TS
26.132.

NOTE: The target value for nominal RLR, as recommended in ITU-T G.111
Annex B -- Table B.1 \[4\], lies between 1 and 3 dB. The higher RLR
requirement of 5 dB for desktop hands-free is appreciative of the
limitations in transducer output with current typical form factors.

### 7.2.4 Connections with hand-held hands-free UE

The nominal values of SLR/RLR to/from the POI shall be:

SLR = 13 ± 4 dB;

RLR = 9 +9/-7 dB.

Where a user-controlled volume control is provided, the RLR shall meet
the nominal value for at least one setting of the control.

The value of RLR at the maximum volume control shall be ≤ (equal or
louder than) 12 dB. As a performance objective it is recommended that
the RLR at the maximum volume control setting is ≤ (equal or louder
than) 2 dB.

Where a user-controlled volume control is provided, the RLR shall meet
the nominal value for at least one setting of the control. It is
recommended that a volume control range ≥ 15 dB be provided.

Compliance shall be checked by the relevant tests described in TS
26.132.

### 7.2.5 Connections with headset UE

The SLR and RLR should be measured and computed using methods given in
ITU-T Recommendation P.380 \[9\]. This Recommendation currently gives a
measuring technique for supra-aural earphone and insert type receivers.
Study is continuing on other types of ear-pieces in ITU-T Study Group
12.

The nominal values of SLR/RLR to/from the POI shall be:

SLR = 8 ± 3 dB;

RLR = 2 ± 3 dB;

RLR (binaural headset) = 8 ± 3 dB for each earphone.

Where a user-controlled receiving volume control is provided, the RLR
shall meet the nominal value for at least one setting of the control.
When the control is set to maximum, the RLR shall not be ≤ (equal or
louder than) -13 dB.

With the volume control set to the minimum position the RLR shall not be
≥ (equal or quieter than) 18 dB and shall not be ≥ (equal or quieter
than) 24 dB for a binaural headset.

Compliance shall be checked by the relevant tests described in 3GPP TS
26.132.

### 7.2.5a Connections with headset UE in the presence of background noise

In the presence of background noise, the RLR at maximum volume control
shall not be ≤ (equal or louder than) ‑13 dB.

Compliance shall be checked by the relevant tests described in TS
26.132.

7.3 Idle channel noise (handset and headset UE)
-----------------------------------------------

### 7.3.1 Sending

The maximum noise level produced by the apparatus at the output of the
SS under silent conditions in the sending direction shall not exceed
-64 dBm0(A).

NOTE 1: This level includes the eventual noise contribution of an
acoustic echo canceller under the condition that no signal is received.

NOTE 2: This figure applies to the total noise level with A-weighting.
It is recommended that the level of single frequency disturbances should
be ≤ -74 dBm0(A) in the frequency range from 100 Hz to 16 kHz.

Compliance shall be checked by the relevant test described in TS 26.132.

### 7.3.2 Receiving

The maximum (acoustic) noise level at the handset and headset UE when no
signal is transmitted to the input of the SS shall be as follows:

\- If no user-controlled receiving volume control is provided, or, if it
is provided, at the setting of the user-controlled receiving volume
control at which the RLR is equal to the nominal value, the noise
measured at the DRP with diffuse-field correction contributed by the
receiving equipment alone shall not exceed -57 dBPa(A).

\- Where a volume control is provided, the measured noise shall be ≤
-54 dBPa(A) at the maximum setting of the volume control.

For the nominal volume control setting, the level of single frequency
disturbances shall be ≤ ‑60 dBPa(A) in the frequency range from 100 Hz
to 16 kHz. As a performance objective it is recommended that the level
should be ≤ ‑64 dBPa(A).

NOTE: In a connection with the PSTN, noise conditions as described in
ITU-T Recommendation G.103 \[3\] can be expected at the input (POI) of
the 3G, LTE, NR or WLAN network. The characteristics of this noise may
be influenced by the speech transcoding process (for further study).

Compliance shall be checked by the relevant test described in TS 26.132.

7.4 Sensitivity/frequency characteristics
-----------------------------------------

### 7.4.0 General

It is recommended for all configurations (handset, headset etc) to have
a flat sending frequency response in super-wideband mode.

Tolerance masks apply to the center frequencies of the fractional octave
bands specified for the respective tests in TS 26.132.

### 7.4.1 Handset and headset UE sending

The sensitivity/frequency characteristics shall be as follows:

The sending sensitivity frequency response, measured either from the
mouth reference point (MRP) to the digital interface or from the MRP to
the SS audio output (digital output of the reference speech decoder of
the SS), shall be within a mask, which can be drawn between the points
given in table 17.

The masks are drawn with straight lines between the breaking points in
the tables on a logarithmic (frequency) - linear (dB sensitivity) scale.

A UE operating in super-wideband mode shall pass the super-wideband
requirements (i.e. when measured according to in 1/3rd octaves) as
specified in Table 17, and shall also pass the wideband
sensitivity/frequency characteristics requirements in the wideband range
using the wideband measurement (i.e. measured in 1/12th octaves) as

7.5 Sidetone characteristics (handset and headset UE)
-----------------------------------------------------

### 7.5.1 Sidetone loss

The talker sidetone masking rating (STMR) shall be ≥ 15 dB and should be
≤ 23 dB for the nominal setting of the volume control. For all other
positions of the volume control, the STMR shall be ≥ 10 dB.

In case the STMR is below the lower limit also when the electrical
sidetone path has been disabled, the result shall not be regarded as a
failure.

Compliance shall be checked by the relevant test described in TS 26.132.

NOTE 1: Where a user-controlled receiving volume control is provided, it
is recommended that the sidetone loss is independent of the volume
control setting.

NOTE 2: In general, it is recommended to provide a terminal sidetone
path for handset and headset UEs.

NOTE 3: In case the human air-conducted sidetone paths are obstructed
(one example being some binaural insert type headset UEs), it is
important to provide a terminal sidetone path.

NOTE 4: The STMR calculation algorithm being used was developed for
quantifying the audibility of the electrical sidetone path using a
sealed coupler. The air-conducted path was not intended to be included
in the test setup. A lower STMR limit was specified to avoid annoying
effects (e.g. howling, increase of ambient noise level in the ear) of an
excessive electrical sidetone. In HATS-based measurements, the
air-conducted path cannot be avoided in the test setup. With some UE
form factors the air-conducted path can be substantial resulting in low
STMR figures also when there are no annoying effects from any excessive
electrical sidetone. See ITU-T Recommendation P.76 for definitions of
sidetone paths.

### 7.5.2 Sidetone delay

The maximum sidetone delay shall be ≤ 5 ms, measured in an echo-free
setup.

NOTE: The measured result is only applicable where the level of the
electrical sidetone is sufficiently high to be measured. While the STMR
value may indicate the presence of sidetone it should be ensured that
this is not primarily due to the acoustical or mechanical sidetone path
when interpreting sidetone delay results.

Compliance shall be checked by the relevant test described in TS 26.132.

7.6 Stability loss
------------------

The stability loss presented to the PSTN by the 3G, LTE, NR or WLAN
network at the POI should meet the principles of the requirements in
clauses 2 and 3 of ITU-T Recommendation G.122 \[6\]. These requirements
will be met if the attenuation between the digital input and digital
output at the POI is ≥ 6 dB at all frequencies in the range 100 Hz to
16 kHz under the worst case acoustic conditions at the UE (any acoustic
echo control should be enabled). For the normal case of digital
connection between the Air Interface and the POI, the stability
requirement can be applied at the Air Interface.

The worst case acoustic conditions will be as follows (with volume
control set to maximum for each following condition):

> **Handset UE:** the handset lying on, and the transducers facing, a
> hard surface with the ear-piece uncapped;
>
> **Headset UE:** for further study;
>
> **Hands-free UE:** no requirement other than echo loss.

NOTE: The test procedure must take into account the switching effects of
echo control and discontinuous transmission (DTX) if applicable.

7.7 Acoustic echo control
-------------------------

### 7.7.1 General

The echo loss (EL) presented by the 3G, LTE, NR or WLAN network at the
POI should be sufficient during single-talk. This takes into account the
fact that the UE is likely to be used in connections with high
transmission delay and in a wide range of noise environments.

The use of acoustic echo control is not mandated for 3G, LTE, NR or WLAN
networks and the connection between the UE and the POI is zero loss.
Therefore the acoustic echo control provided in the UE should provide a
sufficient TCLw at the POI over the likely range of acoustic end delays.

If acoustic echo control is provided by voice switching, comfort noise
should be injected. This comfort noise shall operate in the same way as
that used in DTX.

### 7.7.2 Acoustic echo control in desktop and vehicle-mounted hands-free UE

The TCLw for the desktop and vehicle-mounted hands-free UE shall be ≥
40 dB for any setting of the volume control.

The TCLw for the desktop hands-free and vehicle-mounted hands-free UE
shall be ≥ 46 dB when measured under free-field conditions at the
nominal setting of the volume control.

NOTE: A TCLw for desktop hands-free and vehicle-mounted hands-free UE of
≥ 55 dB is recommended as a performance objective when measured under
free-field conditions at the nominal setting of the volume control.
Depending on the UE idle channel noise in the sending direction, it may
not always be possible to measure an echo loss ≥ 55 dB.

The echo canceller should be designed to cope with the expected
reverberation and dispersion. In the case of the hands-free UE, this
reverberation and dispersion may be time variant. Compliance with this
requirement shall be checked by the relevant test described in TS
26.132.

### 7.7.3 Acoustic echo control in hand-held hands-free UE

The TCLw for hand-held hands-free UE shall be ≥ 40 dB for any setting of
the volume control.

The TCLw for hand-held hands-free UE shall be ≥ 46 dB at the nominal
setting of the volume control.

NOTE: A TCLw for the hand-held hands-free UE of ≥ 55 dB is recommended
as a performance objective when measured under free-field conditions at
the nominal setting of the volume control. Depending on the UE idle
channel noise in the sending direction, it may not always be possible to
measure an echo loss ≥ 55 dB.

The echo canceller should be designed to cope with the expected
reverberation and dispersion. In the case of the hands-free UE, this
reverberation and dispersion may be time variant. Compliance with this
requirement shall be checked by the relevant test described in TS
26.132.

### 7.7.4 Acoustic echo control in a handset UE

The TCLw for handset UE shall be ≥ 46 dB for any setting of the volume
control.

The TCLw for handset UE should be ≥ 55 dB at the nominal setting of the
volume control.

With the volume control set to maximum TCLw should be ≥55 dB.

It is recommended that the volume control should be set back to nominal
after each call unless TCLw ≥ 55 dB can also be maintained with the
maximum volume setting.

NOTE. Depending on the UE idle channel noise in the sending direction,
it may not always be possible to measure an echo loss ≥ 55 dB.

The echo canceller should be capable of dealing with the variations in
handset positions when in normal use. The implications of this are under
study.

Compliance with this requirement shall be checked by the relevant test
described in TS 26.132.

### 7.7.5 Acoustic echo control in a headset UE

The TCLw for headset UE shall be ≥ 46 dB for any setting of the volume
control.

The TCLw for headset UE shall be ≥ 55 dB at the nominal setting of the
volume control.

The volume control shall be set back to nominal after each call unless a
TCLw ≥ 55 dB can also be maintained with the maximum volume setting.

NOTE: Depending on the UE idle channel noise in the sending direction,
it may not always be possible to measure an echo loss ≥ 55 dB.

Due to the obstacle effect of the head in this type of terminal, careful
design might mean that no active echo control is necessary.

The echo cancellation algorithm should be designed to cope with the
expected reverberation and dispersion.

Compliance with this requirement shall be checked by the relevant test
described in TS 26.132.

7.8 Distortion
--------------

### 7.8.1 Sending distortion

The sending part shall meet the following distortion requirements:

NOTE 1: Digital signal processing other than the transcoder itself is
included in this requirement (e.g., echo cancelling).

Distortion shall be measured between the MRP and the SS audio output
(output of the reference speech decoder of the SS). The ratio of
signal‑to‑total distortion power measured with the proper noise
weighting (see table 4 of ITU‑T Recommendation G.223) shall be above the
limits given in table 31.

NOTE 2: Frequencies from 315 Hz to 816 Hz do not apply to the hands-free
UE case, but only to handset and headset UE.

Table 31: Limits for signal‑to‑total distortion ratio

+----------------+-------------------+--------------------+
| Frequency (Hz) | Sending level     | Sending Ratio (dB) |
|                |                   |                    |
|                | (dBPa at the MRP) |                    |
+----------------+-------------------+--------------------+
| 315            | -4,7              | 28                 |

|                | -20               | 27                 |
+----------------+-------------------+--------------------+

Limits for intermediate levels are found by drawing straight lines
between the breaking points in table 31 on a linear (dB signal level) ‑
linear (dB ratio) scale.

Compliance of the sending distortion shall be checked by the test
described in TS 26.132.

NOTE 3: It should be ensured that the test signal is treated by speech
processing algorithms as a speech-like signal, and not a noise-like
signal. Test signals with a time-stationary envelope may be treated by
certain algorithms, e.g., noise suppression algorithms defined in 3GPP
TS 06.77 R99 \[16\], as a noise-like signal. If speech processing
algorithms, including but not limited to noise suppression algorithms,
are shown to treat the test signal as a noise-like signal, even where an
activation signal has been utilized, then the test should be repeated
with said speech processing algorithms disabled. The results of both
sets of tests and the state of the processing algorithms should be
documented in the test report.

### 7.8.2 Receiving

The receiving part between the SS audio input (input of the reference
speech encoder of the SS) and the applicable acoustic measurement point
(DRP with diffuse-field correction for handset and headset modes; free
field correction for hands-free modes) shall meet the requirements in
this sub-clause at the nominal setting of the volume control (except
where another volume setting is specified):

The ratio of signal‑to‑total distortion power measured with the proper
noise weighting (see table 4 of ITU-T Recommendation G.223) shall be
above the limits given in table 32 when the sound pressure at the
applicable acoustic measurement point is \< 10 dBPa. For a sound
pressure ≥ 10 dBPa at the applicable acoustic measurement point there is
no distortion requirement.

NOTE 1: Frequencies from 315 Hz to 816 Hz do not apply to the hands-free
UE case, only to handset and headset UE.

Table 32: Limits for signal-to-total distortion ratio

Limits for intermediate levels are found by drawing straight lines
between the breaking points in the table on a linear (dB signal level) ‑

Compliance of the receiving distortion shall be checked by the
appropriate method in TS 26.132.

NOTE 2: It should be ensured that the test signal is treated by speech
processing algorithms as a speech-like signal, and not a noise-like
signal. Test signals with a time-stationary envelope may be treated by
certain algorithms, e.g., noise suppression algorithms defined in 3GPP
TS 06.77 R99 \[16\], as a noise-like signal.

7.9 Void

7.10 Sending performance in the presence of ambient noise
---------------------------------------------------------

### 7.10.1 General

For sending, in handset mode, the UE shall reduce the ambient noise
picked up by the microphone(s) without significantly degrading the
quality of the speech signal.

### 7.10.2 Connections with handset UE

The UE shall comply with the following requirements:

> S-MOS-LQO~fb~

\- The average of S-MOS-LQO~fb~ scores across all test conditions shall
be ≥ 3.7

\- As a performance objective, the average of the S-MOS-LQO~fb~ scores
across all test conditions should be ≥ 3.9

> N-MOS-LQO~fb~

\- The average of the N-MOS-LQO~fb~ scores across all test conditions
shall be ≥ 2.7

\- As a performance objective, the average of N-MOS-LQO~fb~ scores
across all test conditions should be ≥ 3.3

> G-MOS-LQO~fb~

\- No requirement.

Compliance shall be checked by the relevant tests described in 3GPP TS
26.132.

### 7.10.3 Connections with Handheld hands-free UE

It is recommended that the UE meets the following performance
objectives:

> S-MOS-LQO~fb~

\- The average of S-MOS-LQO~fb~ scores across all five test conditions
should be ≥ 3.4

N-MOS-LQO~fb~

\- The average of N-MOS-LQO~fb~ scores across all test conditions should
be ≥ 2.3

> G-MOS-LQO~fb~

\- No performance objective.

Compliance shall be checked by the relevant tests described in 3GPP TS
26.132.

7.11 Delay
----------

### 7.11.0 UE delay definition

For MTSI-based speech with LTE, NR or WLAN access, the UE delays in the
send and receive directions are defined as:

\- The UE delay in the send (uplink) direction is the delay between the
first acoustic event at the MRP to the last bit of the corresponding
speech frame at the UE antenna

\- The UE delay in the receive (downlink) direction is the delay between
the first bit of a speech frame at the UE antenna and the first acoustic
event at the DRP corresponding to that speech frame

### 7.11.1 Handset UE

It is in general desirable to minimize UE delays to ensure low enough
end-to-end delays and hence a good conversational experience, guidance
is found in ITU-T Recommendation G.114.

For MTSI-based speech-only with LTE, NR or WLAN access in error and
jitter free conditions and EVS speech codec operation, the sum of the UE
delays in sending and receiving directions (T~S~ + T~R~) should be ≤
157ms. *If this performance objective cannot be met, the sum of the UE
delays* in sending and receiving directions (T~S~ + T~R~) *shall in* any
case be ≤ 197ms.

For MTSI-based speech-only with LTE, NR or WLAN access in conditions
with simulated packet arrival time variations and packet loss and EVS
speech codec operation, the sum of the UE delays in sending and
receiving directions (T~S~ + T~R~) shall be less than or equal to the
delay requirements in Table 32a1, while meeting the speech quality
targets defined.

NOTE: The UE delay requirements for MTSI-based speech-only with LTE, NR
or WLAN access are derived from:

\- A codec algorithmic delay of 32ms including speech frame buffering
and encoder lookahead.

\- An air interface transmission time of 1ms on receive and 1ms on the
send direction.

\- A budget allowance for a jitter buffer depth of 40ms for error and
jitter free conditions and test conditions 0 and 1 of Table 32a1, and
80ms for test condition 2 and 3 of Table 32a1. This budget is also
applied in Table 32b1 (when testing in EVS 13.2 kbit/s channel-aware
mode).

\- A budget allowance for vendor specific implementation of 83ms
corresponding to the performance objective and 123ms corresponding to
the required maximum UE send and receive delay.

WLAN access

### 7.11.2 Headset UE

#### 7.11.2.1 Wired headset

It is in general desirable to minimize UE delays to ensure low enough
end-to-end delays and hence a good conversational experience, guidance
is found in ITU-T Recommendation G.114.

For MTSI-based speech-only with LTE, NR or WLAN access in error and
jitter free conditions and EVS speech codec operation, the sum of the UE
delays in sending and receiving directions (T~S~ + T~R~) should be ≤
157ms. *If this performance objective cannot be met, the sum of the UE
delays* in sending and receiving directions (T~S~ + T~R~) *shall in* any
case be ≤ 197ms.

For MTSI-based speech-only with LTE, NR or WLAN access in conditions
with simulated packet arrival time variations and packet loss and EVS
speech codec operation, the sum of the UE delays in sending and
receiving directions (T~S~ + T~R~) shall be less than or equal to the
delay requirements in Table 32a2, while meeting the speech quality
targets defined.

NOTE: The UE delay requirements for MTSI-based speech-only with LTE, NR
or WLAN access are derived from:

\- A codec algorithmic delay of 32ms including speech frame buffering
and encoder lookahead.

\- An air interface transmission time of 1ms on receive and 1ms on the
send direction.

\- A budget allowance for a jitter buffer depth of 40ms for error and
jitter free conditions and test conditions 0 and 1 of Table 32a2, and
80ms for test condition 2 and 3 of Table 32a2. This budget is also
applied in Table 32b2 (when testing in EVS 13.2 kbit/s channel-aware
mode).

*- A budget allowance for vendor specific implementation of 83ms
corresponding to the performance objective and 123ms corresponding to
the required maximum UE send and receive delay.*

WLAN access

7.12 Echo control characteristics
---------------------------------

Echo cancellation is commonly deployed in the UE to fulfil the Acoustic
echo control requirements. Echo cancellers are complex devices of which
the subjective performance is affected by several attributes. The main
attribute is its ability to suppress echo. The process of suppressing
the echo may introduce impairments to the near-end speech signal, mainly
manifested as distortion or clipping of the near-end signal during
simultaneous speech from both the far and near-end (\"double-talk\").

To characterise the echo control performance, the activity (in % of
total time) and averaged level difference (in dB) of the duration of any
level difference according to Figure 22 and Table 33 between the clean
near-end signal and the send-signal shall be reported for
\"double-talk\" as well as the far-end single talk periods adjacent to
the \"double-talk\".

NOTE: The limits for specifying the categories in Figure 22 and Table 33
are provisional pending further analysis and validation.

NOTE: The categories in Figure 22 and Table 33 are labelled in a
functional order and the subjective impression of the respective
categories is for further study.

All percentage values and averaged level differences described in the
relevant test of 3GPP TS 26.132 shall be reported.

Figure 22: Classification of echo canceller performance

Table 33: Categories for echo canceller performance classification

  ---------- -----------------------------------------------
  Category   Description
  **A1**     Full-duplex and full transparency
  **A2**     Full-duplex with level loss in Tx
  **B**      Very short clipping
  **C**      Short clipping resulting in loss of syllables
  **D**      Clipping resulting in loss of words
  **E**      Very short residual echo
  **F**      Echo bursts
  **G**      Continuous echo

Requirements are for further study.

### 7.12.3 Handheld hands-free

Requirements are for further study.

### 7.12.4 Desktop and vehicle mounted hands-free

Requirements are for further study.

7.13 Clock accuracy
-------------------

For MTSI-based speech-only with LTE, NR or WLAN access, the clock skew
in send direction between the device under test and the reference client
should be less than 50 PPM (in absolute value) in error-free conditions.

Compliance shall be checked by the relevant test described in TS 26.132.

7.14 Jitter buffer management behaviour
---------------------------------------

For MTSI-based speech-only with LTE, NR or WLAN access, a jitter buffer
is used in receiving to handle the variation in packet receiver timing
(see clause 8 of TS 26.114 \[17\]).

If the jitter buffer management (JBM) behaviour is evaluated, the
following statistics shall be reported for conditions specified in TS
26.132:

\- Delay histogram (on a per sentence basis)

\- Quality loss histogram (on a per sentence pair basis)

and all measured delay and quality loss values for these conditions
shall be reported as a function of measurement time, together with
minimum and maximum values.

The relevant test is described in 3GPP TS 26.132.

8 Fullband telephony transmission performance
=============================================

8.1 Applicability
-----------------

The performance requirements in this clause shall apply when UE is used
to provide fullband telephony, either as a stand-alone service, or as
part of a multimedia service. The requirements in the clause apply only
when the far-end terminal is also providing fullband telephony. When a
fullband-enabled terminal is providing narrowband telephony, the
requirements in clause 5, 'narrowband telephony transmission
performance' shall apply. When a fullband-enabled terminal is providing
wideband telephony, the requirements in clause 6, 'Wideband telephony
transmission performance' shall apply. When a fullband-enabled terminal
is providing super-wideband telephony, the requirements in clause 7,
'Super-wideband telephony transmission performance' shall apply.

8.11 Delay
----------

### 8.11.0 UE delay definition

For MTSI-based speech with LTE, NR or WLAN access, the UE delays in the
send and receive directions are defined as:

\- The UE delay in the send (uplink) direction is the delay between the
first acoustic event at the MRP to the last bit of the corresponding
speech frame at the UE antenna

\- The UE delay in the receive (downlink) direction is the delay between
the first bit of a speech frame at the UE antenna and the first acoustic
event at the DRP corresponding to that speech frame

NOTE: In order to harmonize UMTS and LTE delay definitions, the
reference points for UMTS UE delay have been changed in Rel-12. Prior to
Rel-12, the UE reference points for UMTS were implicitly defined by the
compensation factors declared by system simulator vendors, i.e. half of
the air interface delay was attributed to the UE, and the last acoustic
event at DRP was used for the receive measurement instead of the first.

Considering 10ms for half of the transmission time in each direction of
a UMTS call, a speech frame size of 20ms, a codec look-ahead of 5ms, and
a difference between the first and the last acoustic event of 20 ms, the
previous reference points took into account a UE implementation
independent delay of 2x10ms + 25 ms + 20 ms = 65 ms. The same UE delay
remains in the new definition above, which attributes the full air
interface delay to the UE but uses the first acoustic event at the DRP,
instead of the last (2x20ms + 25 ms + 0 ms = 65 ms). Hence, the UMTS
requirements with these new reference points remain the same.

### 8.11.1 Handset UE

It is in general desirable to minimize UE delays to ensure low enough
end-to-end delays and hence a good conversational experience, guidance
is found in ITU-T Recommendation G.114.

For MTSI-based speech-only with LTE, NR or WLAN access in error and
jitter free conditions and EVS speech codec operation, the sum of the UE
delays in sending and receiving directions (T~S~ + T~R~) should be ≤
157ms. *If this performance objective cannot be met, the sum of the UE
delays* in sending and receiving directions (T~S~ + T~R~) *shall in* any
case be ≤ 197ms.

For MTSI-based speech-only with LTE, NR or WLAN access in conditions
with simulated packet arrival time variations and packet loss and EVS
speech codec operation, the sum of the UE delays in sending and
receiving directions (T~S~ + T~R~) shall be less than or equal to the
delay requirements in Table 33a1, while meeting the speech quality
targets defined.

NOTE: The UE delay requirements for MTSI-based speech-only with LTE, NR
or WLAN access are derived from:

\- A codec algorithmic delay of 32ms including speech frame buffering
and encoder lookahead.

\- An air interface transmission time of 1ms on receive and 1ms on the
send direction.

\- A budget allowance for a jitter buffer depth of 40ms for error and
jitter free conditions and test conditions 0 and 1 of Table 33a1, and
80ms for test condition 2 of Table 33a1.

\- A budget allowance for vendor specific implementation of 83ms
corresponding to the performance objective and 123ms corresponding to
the required maximum UE send and receive delay..

WLAN access

### 8.11.2 Headset UE

#### 8.11.2.1 Wired headset

It is in general desirable to minimize UE delays to ensure low enough
end-to-end delays and hence a good conversational experience, guidance
is found in ITU-T Recommendation G.114.

For MTSI-based speech-only with LTE, NR or WLAN access in error and
jitter free conditions and EVS speech codec operation, the sum of the UE
delays in sending and receiving directions (T~S~ + T~R~) should be ≤
157ms. *If this performance objective cannot be met, the sum of the UE
delays* in sending and receiving directions (T~S~ + T~R~) *shall in* any
case be ≤ 197ms.

For MTSI-based speech-only with LTE, NR or WLAN access in conditions
with simulated packet arrival time variations and packet loss and EVS
speech codec operation, the sum of the UE delays in sending and
receiving directions (T~S~ + T~R~) shall be less than or equal to the
delay requirements in Table 33a2, while meeting the speech quality
targets defined.

NOTE: The UE delay requirements for MTSI-based speech-only with LTE, NR
or WLAN access are derived from:

\- A codec algorithmic delay of 32ms including speech frame buffering
and encoder lookahead.

\- An air interface transmission time of 1ms on receive and 1ms on the
send direction.

\- A budget allowance for a jitter buffer depth of 40ms for error and
jitter free conditions and test conditions 0 and 1 of Table 33a2, and
80ms for test condition 2 of Table 33a2.

*- A budget allowance for vendor specific implementation of 83ms
corresponding to the performance objective and 123ms corresponding to
the required maximum UE send and receive delay.*

WLAN access

Compliance shall be checked by the relevant tests described in 3GPP TS
26.132.

#### 8.11.2.2 Wireless headset

For further study.

8.12 Echo control characteristics
---------------------------------

See requirements for super-wideband.

### 8.12.1 Handset

Requirements are for further study.

### 8.12.2 Headset

Requirements are for further study.

### 8.12.3 Handheld hands-free

Requirements are for further study.

### 8.12.4 Desktop and vehicle mounted hands-free

Requirements are for further study.

8.13 Clock accuracy
-------------------

For MTSI-based speech-only with LTE, NR or WLAN access, the clock skew
in send direction between the device under test and the reference client
should be less than 50 PPM (in absolute value) in error-free conditions.

Compliance shall be checked by the relevant test described in TS 26.132.

8.14 Jitter buffer management behaviour
---------------------------------------

For MTSI-based speech-only with LTE, NR or WLAN access, a jitter buffer
is used in receiving to handle the variation in packet receiver timing
(see clause 8 of TS 26.114 \[17\]).

If the jitter buffer management (JBM) behaviour is evaluated, the
following statistics shall be reported for conditions specified in TS
26.132:

> \- Delay histogram (on a per sentence basis)
>
> \- Quality loss histogram (on a per sentence pair basis)

and all measured delay and quality loss values for these conditions
shall be reported as a function of measurement time, together with
minimum and maximum values.

The relevant test is described in 3GPP TS 26.132.
