Summary
=======

This document summarizes the results of a Round Robin test conducted
between April and August 2015. The document introduces the results and
analyzes the accuracy of the different simulation methods when used in
different labs. It furthermore shows the impact of the different
analysis methods on the results measured with different mobile
terminals.

Introduction
============

The aim of the Round Robin test conducted under the ATeMPO\_SPINE work
item \[1\] was mainly to answer the following questions:

-   How good is the reproducibility of the different methods?

-   Are there differences in the measured performance when using the
    different devices with different setups?

The following labs were participating in the test:

-   Audience Inc.

-   HEAD acoustics GmbH

-   Orange

-   Sony Mobile Communications

In the Round Robin test 7 different devices were used, some labs tested
only a subset of 6 devices as agreed upon in advance. Not all labs
conducted the full set of tests in Narrowband and Wideband. At HEAD
acoustics two rooms were used to conduct the tests, in all other labs
the tests were conducted in one room.

For measurements using the ES 202 396-1 background playback methodology,
occasional playback problems were observed in the 2.1 lab. This explains
the outliers and might have partly contributed to some other (lower) MOS
values for this lab, for this playback method. The overall tendencies
observed in the complete data set are not strongly affected by these
issues.

General test setup
==================

In order to minimize all variabilities coming from other sources than
the different setups and rooms used all test and the sequencing of all
tests was prepared by HEAD acoustics and provided to all test labs. All
labs used HEAD acoustics ACQUA with the HAE-BGN and 3PASS background
noise systems with the identical database. All data were integrated in a
final database containing the results of all labs. Based on this
procedure it was easy to perform all types of analyses as needed for the
Round Robin experiment.

The selection of the rooms was up to the test labs. However, the
requirements as found in \[2\] and \[3\] was followed. The detailed test
setup is described in the individual reports of the test labs (\[4\],
\[7\], \[8\], \[9\]).

Figure 1and Figure 2 show the general test setup for the two background
noise simulation methods.

103 224 \[3\]

The calibration of the setups was made by each lab individually. The
calibration procedures as described in \[2\] and \[3\] which are
integrated in HAE-BGN and 3PASS were followed by each lab. The
calibration results are found in the individual test reports of the test
labs.

HHHF: Comparison of inter-lab accuracy for the different background noise simulation methods
============================================================================================

In this section we compare the S- N- G- MOS results as measured in the
different rooms with the different terminals. The comparison is focused
on the accuracy of the different background noise simulation systems.
The comparison is made for each method and each set of background noise
separately. Arbitrarily one room can be taken as a reference and the
results measured in the other rooms are referred to this reference room.
In our case Lab 2.1 was taken as a reference room since at Sony all
tests were conducted with all devices

The following plots show the differences between the (arbitrarily
chosen) Sony test room (RT60 = 140 ms) and the other rooms:

  --------- ----------------------- ------------------- -----------------------

Dealing with outliers
---------------------

Four outliers could be observed which could clearly be traced back to an
error in the measurement setup and therefore do not represent any
characteristics of the background noise generation method used. In this
chapter the diagrams contain these outliers while the RMSE-values are
calculated without outliers. In the following chapter these outliers are
ignored.

The outliers are:

### No background noise

In this chapter we see basically the variance to be expected in
different labs with no background noise simulation present. This
variance may be influenced by:

-   Calibration differences

-   Setup differences

-   Room differences

-   Time variant behavior of the device under test

It seems that these parameters may have impact on the results in a
similar or even bigger range than the experiments which include the
background noise simulation. The main impact is on S-MOS resulting in
somewhat scattered G-MOS results as well.

-   N-MOS shows the highest variation in results up to about 0.5 MOS

-   S-MOS shows a high variation of the results for Pub-noise and Train
    station noise

Please note that outliers as indicated by the test labs Sony and
Audience are excluded from the RMSE calculations.

### Background Noises & Simulation acc. to TS 103 224

The results shown in this section are based on using the TS 103 224
Simulation as well as the background noises from this standard. For this
setup the following observations can be made:

-   All results line up fairly well, no offset between the labs can be
    observed

-   The results are less scattered leading to low RMSE values between
    0.11 and 0.14

-   Especially N-MOS values are measured very consistent

HHHF: Comparison of measurement results between ES 202 396-1 and TS 103 224 background noise simulation technique
=================================================================================================================

In this section we compare the S- N- G- MOS results as measured in the
different rooms with the different terminals. The comparison is focused
on the difference of the different background noise simulation systems.
The comparison is made between each method and the different sets of
background noises. The results measured using the ETSI ES 202 396-1
background noise simulation system \[2\]f or all noises in all labs with
all terminals are used as the reference. The results measured using the
ETSI TS 103 224 simulation system \[3\] are plotted on the abscissa
(y-axis) for comparison.

The results of the different devices are color coded as indicated in the
figures.

### Background Noises & Simulation acc. to ES 202 396-1 compared to TS 103 224 simulation - including differences due to different noise recordings

While for crossroad, inside car office and pub noise the measurements
lead to quite comparable results deviations are seen for the cafeteria
and train station noise. The reason for these differences is the
different nature of the noises in the different noise databases. E.g.
the cafeteria noise is in average about 6 dB lower in level for the
recordings in EG 202 396-1, the train station noise is about 7 dB higher
in level.

### Simulation acc. to ES 202 396-1 with noises from TS 103 224 (binaural) compared to TS 103 224 simulation

When choosing the same type of recordings by taking the binaurally
recorded noises form TS 103 224 the differences between the methods
become smaller, the results line up in general. More variation can be
seen for the N-MOS results than for the S-MOS results. This is clearly
indicating the difference in the background noise simulation method. The
S-MOS seems to be mainly determined by the speech signal which is
unchanged in the experiments.

### Differences between TS 103 224 and ES 202 396-1

Differences in the absolute values when comparing ES 202 396-1 with TS
103 224 can be seen for all terminals (see Figure 40). The offset is not
constant but depending on the type of terminal. The main difference is
found in the N-MOS values indication the different sensitivity of
individual terminals to the different types of noise. The performance
for all terminals is better when using the ES 202 396-1. Again, this is
due to the less stressing noises in this standard.

HHHF: Analyses of the noise spectra reproduced at the reference microphone
==========================================================================

The background noises spectra measured at the reference microphone of
all devices under test are plotted into one diagram for all background
noises which were used in this test. Each diagram contains background
noise spectra from

-   6 DUTs from Lab 1 (DUT7 was not measured)

    -   Two times because two different rooms were available

-   7 DUTs from Lab 2

-   7 DUTs from Lab 3

-   7 DUTs from Lab 4

    -   Two times because two different setups were made

 Simulation acc. to ES 202 396-1 with recordings from TS 103 224, reference recording at place of DUT-microphone
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For all background noise quite big differences can be found in the
spectra reproduced by the ES 202 396-1 simulation method. The
differences depend to some extent on the noise type. More uniform
background noises such as e.g. car show less spectral variance than e.g.
the train station which performs worst.

The differences range from 5 dB up to 15 dB. Consistently big
differences are found in the low frequency domain.

Simulation & Recordings acc. to TS 103 224, reference recording at place of DUT-microphone
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The differences in the spectra reproduced by the TS 103 224 simulation
method are significantly lower compared to the ES 202 396-1 simulation
method. The differences seem to be independent of the noise type.

The differences range from 1 dB up to 10 dB. As expected the sound field
reproduction is very consistent between labs in the low frequency domain
up to about 2 kHz, there where the maximum of energy is found. The
spectral differences are in the range of 1-2 dB. Up to about 8 kHz the
differences are still less than 3 dB from 10 -20 kHz the differences
remain below 5 dB.

==========================================================================================================

Wideband
--------

In this chapter we see basically the variance to be expected in
different labs with no background noise simulation present. This
variance may be influenced by:

-   Calibration differences

-   Setup differences

-   Room differences

-   Time variant behavior of the device under test

It seems that these parameters may have impact on the results in a
similar or even bigger range than the experiments which include the
background noise simulation.

In this section we compare the S- N- G- MOS results as measured in the
different rooms with the different terminals. The comparison is focused
on the difference of the different background noise simulation systems.
The comparison is made between each method and the desktop office noise.
The results measured using the ETSI ES 202 396-1 background noise

results measured using the ETSI TS 103 224 simulation system \[3\] are
plotted on the abscissa (y-axis) for comparison.

In general we see a fairly good agreement between the background noise

in N-MOS which leads to some deviation in G-MOS as well.

As for already seen for the HHHFT experiments quite big differences can
be found in the spectra reproduced by the ES 202 396-1 simulation method
in the different labs.

The differences range from 5 dB up to 15 dB. Consistently big
differences are found in the low frequency domain.

Simulation & Recordings acc. to TS 103 224, reference recording at place of DUT-microphone
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The differences in the spectra reproduced by the TS 103 224 simulation
method are significantly lower compared to the ES 202 396-1 simulation
method. The differences seem to be independent of the noise type.

The differences range from 1 dB up to 8 dB. As expected the sound field
reproduction is very consistent between labs in the low frequency domain
up to about 2 kHz, there where the maximum of energy is found. The
spectral differences are in the range of 1-2 dB. Up to about 8 kHz the
differences are still less than 5 dB from 10 -20 kHz the differences
remain below 8 dB.

Conclusions
===========

The following conclusions can be drawn from the Round Robin Experiment:

-   In general the inter-lab consistency of the results is good.

-   When using the background noises from ES 202 396-1 \[2\] somewhat
    higher performance results can be expected due to the different
    nature of the background noises and the different signal levels
    especially for Cafeteria noise and train station noise

-   When using the binaurally recorded background noises from TS 103 224
    \[3\] for the tests the differences when comparing ES 202 396-1
    \[2\] with TS 103 224 \[3\] are small. The offset is not constant
    but depending on the type of terminal. The performance for all
    terminals is measured slightly better when using the ES 202 396 in
    hand-held HFT. For desktop HFT the variations observed are slightly
    bigger, the differences are not consistent.The inter-lab correlation
    when using TS 103 224 \[3\] is higher than with ES 202 396-1 \[2\].
    For ES 202 396-1 the RMSE values are between 0.13 and 0.25. For TS
    103 224 the RMSE values of the results between labs are in the range
    of 0.07 to 0.2.

-   The differences when analyzing in hand-held hands-free mode
    according to the current version of TS 26.131 \[5\] and TS 26.132
    \[6\] and averaging S-, N- and G-MOS over all background noises are
    small when comparing TS 103 224 and ES 202 396-1 with background
    noises from TS 103 224. The differences are in the range of 0.1 --
    0.2 MOS. The differences are terminal dependent. Surprisingly the
    performance for all terminals is slightly better when using the ES
    202 396-1 \[2\] simulation method compared to the sound field
    simulation technique described in TS 103 224 \[3\].

-   When testing in Desktop position the differences when analyzing
    according to the current version of TS 26.131 \[5\] and TS 26.132
    \[6\] and averaging S-, N- and G-MOS over all background noises are
    slightly bigger compared to hand-held hands-free mode. However, it
    should be noted that only 2 labs with 3 different rooms were
    participating in this experiment.

-   The accuracy and consistency of the background noise reproduction at
    the terminal is significantly better especially in the low frequency
    domain below 2 kHz when using TS 103 224 \[3\]. Spectral differences
    measured at the reference microphone drop from 5-15 dB when
    measuring in 1/3^rd^ octaves for the ES 202 396-1 \[2\] simulation
    method to 1-5 dB when using the TS 103 224 \[3\] simulation method.
    It was discussed whether might be possible to reduce the variability
    of the ES 202 396-1 sound field reproduction further by defining and
    validation the delays between the loudspeakers in a different way
    than it is currently made in ES 202 396-1. However, whether this is
    possible and leads to less variability is unknown and needs to be
    addressed in ETSI TC STQ.
