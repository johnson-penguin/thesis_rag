Introduction
============

This document provides a verification plan for the SES codec selection.
The SES candidate selected during SA4\#30 (February 23-27, 2004) will be
brought to TSG-SA for approval (TSG-SA\#23, March 15-17, 2003). Some
critical items (as listed in \[1\]) will be verified by volunteering
organizations before the candidate is brought to TSG-SA.

The codecs under consideration are the AFE/X-AFE codec (Advanced DSR
front-end and its extension, cf. \[3,4\]), the AMR-NB codec and the
AMR-WB codec. In case of the AMR-NB and AMR-WB codecs are selected then
the independent complexity assessment results that are already available
from earlier standardisation efforts will be used to verify the
complexity. In the case of the AFE/X-AFE codec the fixed-point
implementation will be verified.

In the case that SA4 passes decision to TSG-SA because the performance
falls in the "grey area" of the recommendation criteria (cf. \[11\]) and
SA4 is unable to reach consensus then verification will also be
performed before it is brought to TSG-SA.

Verification of bit-exactness
=============================

Motivation
----------

The motivation is to check that the executable used by the ASR vendors
corresponds to the executable built from the source code of the selected
candidate. A test of \"bit-exactness\" is used to verify the match of
the output bitstreams of the compiled version of the source code of the
selected candidate and the executables provided to the two test
laboratories for selection testing. Output files from both versions are
compared with respect to the bit-exactness.

Definition
----------

The verification laboratories will make use of:

1.  Executables obtained by compiling the source code of the candidate

2.  Executables used for selection testing

3.  A subset of the samples used for the selection phase.

During the evaluation phase of the AFE/X-AFE algorithm conducted by the
testing laboratories, two sampling rates were used, one for the
narrowband case (T8) and one for the wideband case (T16). The binaries
were delivered for two different platforms: I386/linux RH7.3 (resp.
T8\_linux and T16\_linux) and AIX (resp. T8\_AIX and T16\_AIX).

Source codes will be provided to the verification laboratories. The
executables compiled from the source code are the reference executables
to be run at the different sampling rates (resp. B8 and B16).

Bit exactness will be checked with the VAD flag off since ASR vendors
did not use VAD in their evaluations \[section 2.3 of 10\].

The bit-exactness verification will be made on a subset of the samples
used for the selection phase:

Task
----

### Narrowband verification

The verification laboratory tests the bit-exactness of the output
bitstream of the candidate B8 vs. the output bitstream of the executable
T8\_linux or T8\_AIX provided to the testing laboratories.

> height="2.2756944444444445in"}
>
> Figure 1: Verification of the bit-exactness of the narrowband
> candidate

The platform used for verifying the bit-exactness of the candidate is
not relevant because the source code of the narrowband candidate is
platform independent (i.e. bit-exact on any supported platform). The
verification laboratories can use any supported platform for verifying
T8\_linux or T8\_AIX, i.e. the executable used by the test laboratories.

### Wideband verification

The verification laboratory tests the bit-exactness of the output
bitstream of the candidate B16\_linux vs. the output bitstream of the
executable T16\_linux provided to the testing laboratories.

![](media/image2.wmf){width="4.0in" height="1.863888888888889in"}

> Figure 2: Verification of the bit-exactness of the wideband candidate

Motorola notified to the committee that 6 lines of the code delivered to
the testing laboratories were incorrect. Only the wideband case
(T16\_linux and T16\_AIX) is affected (cf. \[5\]). The code delivered to
the testing laboratories contains a processing block using the
floating-point arithmetic (cf. \[6\]). The verification laboratory
checks that the compilation of the source code with the floating-point
arithmetic mentioned by Motorola and the executables delivered to the
testing laboratories generate identical bitstreams. However, since the
IEEE floating-point arithmetic is not bit-exact (cf. \[7,8\]), the
verification of the binaries can be conducted only on a similar platform
(same hardware, same compiler, same compilation options).

WMOPS Complexity verification
=============================

Motivation
----------

The compiled version of the fixed-point ANSI-C source code must meet the
design constraints (cf. \[9\]). The WMOPS complexity of the candidate
will be estimated in the framework of the worst observed frame on a
subset of the samples used for the selection phase.

  --------------- -----------------------------
  **Bandwidth**   **WMOPS design constraint**
  narrowband      ≤25 WMOPS
  wideband        ≤39 WMOPS
  --------------- -----------------------------

> Table 2: complexity requirements for the SES candidate

Source-code verification
------------------------

The source code is used to verify the complexity of the codec. The
verification laboratory checks that the C-code has been correctly
implemented with basic operators and that the C-code correctly
implements the instrumentation that generates a maximum WMOPS score for
each sample file.

Complexity verification
-----------------------

### Task

The verification laboratories compile the C-code on one of the supported
platforms (gcc on AIX, i386/linux RH7, Sun Solaris 8 or possibly VC++ on
win32) and build an executable to be run at the different sampling rates
(resp. A8 for the narrowband and A16 for the wideband) (Note: the
versions A8 and B8 are identical).

The verification laboratories check that the complexity of the VAD
processing is included in the WMOPS complexity verification as indicated
in \[9\].

The executable generates a log file with the maximum observed WMOPS
score for each sample file. The verification laboratories process all
the files from the selected subset and evaluate the maximum observed
WMOPS score. The maximum observed WMOPS score is evaluated by selecting
the maximum WMOPS score from every sample file. The obtained maximum
observed WMOPS score is compared with the design constraints (cf. Table
2).

### Database selection

The verification of the WMOPs complexity is made on a subset of the
samples used for the selection phase (cf. Table 1).

### Narrowband verification

The verification laboratory processes the selected databases (**A3I8**
and **MND8**) through the A8 executable and produces the maximum WMOPS
score.

>
> Figure 3: Verification of the complexity of the narrowband candidate

The platform used for the complexity verification is not relevant for
the purpose of the WMOPS complexity verification.

### Wideband verification

The verification laboratory processes the selected databases (**A3I16**)
through the A16 executable and produces the maximum WMOPS score.

The platform used for the complexity verification is not relevant for
the purpose of the WMOPS complexity verification.

RAM and ROM Complexity verification
===================================

Motivation
----------

The memory used by the fixed-point ANSI-C source code must meet the
design constraints (cf. \[9\]). The memory complexity of the candidate
will be estimated from the source code.

  --------------- --------------------------- ---------------------------
  **Bandwidth**   **ROM design constraint**   **RAM design constraint**
  narrowband      ≤20 kwords                  ≤7 kwords
  wideband        ≤34 kwords                  ≤8 kwords
  --------------- --------------------------- ---------------------------

> Table 3: memory requirements for the SES candidate (16-bit words)

Definition
----------

The RAM memory used by the software is the sum of all the non-const
arrays or variables defined with a global visibility, all the static
arrays or variables (known as the static memory or permanent allocation)
and the maximum amount of RAM required by the stack (known as the
scratch memory).

The ROM memory used by the software is the sum of all the const arrays
or variables (defined in a global or in local visibility). The ROM
memory does not include the program ROM (cf. \[9\]).

The following sample source code explains how the RAM and the ROM memory
are evaluated.

> Word16 buff\[16\];
>
> const Word32 tab\[32\];
>
> Word16
>
> func(void \*state, Word16 a, const Word16 v\[\])
>
> {
>
> Word16 ret;
>
> Word16 local\_buff\[8\];
>
> static Word16 state=START;
>
> \[\...\]
>
> return ret;
>
> }
>
> Code 1: Example of instrumented C-code

In this small example, the memory complexity would be evaluated as
follow:

+---------------------------+--------------------+-------------------+

+---------------------------+--------------------+-------------------+

### Static RAM array initialization

Arrays that are allocated and initialised in the static RAM are
accounted simultaneously in static RAM and in ROM.

### Stack array initialization

Arrays that are allocated and initialised in the stack are accounted
only in static RAM. Furthermore, the code shall be instrumented with as
many move16() (resp. move32()) basic operations than necessary in order
to take into account the actual initialisation process. Here follows a
small example:

> Word16
>
> func\_proc(Word16 a, Word32 b)
>
> {
>
> \[\...\]
>
> Word16 autoBuff\[4\]={0x4000, 0x1400, 0xFC00, 0xAFF0};
>
> move16();move16();move16();move16();
>
> \[\...\]
>
> return 0;
>
> }
>
> Code 2: Instrumented C-code initializing an array in the stack

Said differently, the process of initialising an array allocated in the
stack is formally equivalent to the following C-code fragment:

> Word16
>
> func\_proc(Word16 a, Word32 b)
>
> {
>
> \[\...\]
>
> Word16 autoBuff\[4\];
>
> autoBuff\[0\] = 0x4000; move16();
>
> autoBuff\[1\] = 0x1400; move16();
>
> autoBuff\[2\] = 0xFC00; move16();
>
> autoBuff\[3\] = 0xAFF0; move16();
>
> \[\...\]
>
> return 0;
>
> }
>
> Code 3: Unambiguous equivalent C-code for initializing an array in the
> stack

### Constant value usage

Most C compilers for DSP will inline Word16 and Word32 constant values
directly in the assembly language code. Therefore, constant values (such
as 0x00400000L and 25798L) will not be included in the data ROM; instead
they are included in the program source code.

### Summary

The following table sums up the different configurations considered for
assessing the complexity and the memory usage regarding the usage of
constant values in the reference C-code.

+---------------------------+--------------------+-------------------+
| **C instruction**         | **Type of memory** | **Accounted for** |
+---------------------------+--------------------+-------------------+
| ### Word16 sw             | ROM + static RAM   | 4 each            |

ROM verification
----------------

The source code is used to evaluate the ROM complexity. The amount of
ROM memory used by the candidate, as evaluated by the verification
laboratories, is compared to the design constraints (cf. Table 3).

RAM verification
----------------

### Permanent RAM verification

The source code is used to evaluate the RAM usage that is not related to
the use of the stack. The verification laboratory enumerates all the
array and variable definitions corresponding to a permanent allocation.

### Stack verification

The source code is used to evaluate the stack usage. The verification
laboratory builds the calling tree of the source code and evaluates the
worst case for the stack usage.

### Conclusion

The verification laboratory sums the amount of static RAM and the
maximum amount of RAM required by the stack. The amount of RAM memory is
compared to the design constraints (cf. Table 3).
