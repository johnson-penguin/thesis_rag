=======

This specification defines an error concealment procedure, also termed
frame substitution and muting procedure, which shall be used by the
AMR-WB speech codec receiving end when one or more erroneous/lost speech
or lost Silence Descriptor (SID) frames are received.

The requirements of this document are mandatory for implementation in
all networks and User Equipment (UE)s capable of supporting the AMR-WB
speech codec. It is not mandatory to follow the bit exact implementation
outlined in this document and the corresponding C source code.

4 General
=========

The purpose of the error concealment procedure is to conceal the effect
of erroneous/lost AMR-WB speech frames. The purpose of muting the output
in the case of several erroneous/lost frames is to indicate the
breakdown of the channel to the user and to avoid generating possible
annoying sounds as a result from the error concealment procedure.

The network shall indicate erroneous/lost speech or lost SID frames by
setting the RX\_TYPE values \[3\] to SPEECH\_BAD, SID\_BAD or
SPEECH\_LOST. If these flags are set, the speech decoder shall perform
parameter substitution to conceal errors.

The example solution provided in paragraph 6 apply only to bad frame
handling on a complete speech frame basis. Sub-frame based error
concealment may be derived using similar methods.

5 Requirements
==============

5.1 Error detection
-------------------

If the most sensitive bits of the AMR-WB speech data (class A in \[4\])
are received in error, the network shall indicate RX\_TYPE = SPEECH\_BAD
in which case the BFI flag is set. When the frame is not received, the
network shall indicate RX\_TYPE = RX\_SPEECH\_LOST in which case the BFI
flag is set as well. If a SID frame is received in error, the network
shall indicate RX\_TYPE = SID\_BAD..

5.2 Erroneous or lost speech frames
-----------------------------------

Normal decoding of erroneous/lost speech frames would result in very
unpleasant noise effects. In order to improve the subjective quality,
erroneous/lost speech frames shall be substituted with either a
repetition or an extrapolation of the previous good speech frame(s).
This substitution is done so that it gradually will decrease the output
level, resulting in silence at the output. Subclause 6 provides example
solution.

5.3 First lost SID frame
------------------------

A lost SID frame shall be substituted by using the SID information from
earlier received valid SID frames and the procedure for valid SID frames
be applied as described in \[3\].

5.4 Subsequent lost SID frames 
------------------------------

For many subsequent lost SID frames, a muting technique shall be applied
to the comfort noise that will gradually decrease the output level. For
subsequent lost SID frames, the muting of the output shall be
maintained. Subclause 6 provides example solutions.

6 Example ECU/BFH Solution 
==========================

6.1 State Machine
-----------------

This example solution for substitution and muting is based on a state
machine with seven states (Figure 1).

The system starts in state 0. Each time a bad frame is detected, the
state counter is incremented by one and is saturated when it reaches 6.
Each time a good speech frame is detected, the state counter is
right-shifted by one. The state indicates the quality of the channel:
the larger the value of the state counter, the worse the channel quality
is. The control flow of the state machine can be described by the
following C code (**BFI** = bad frame indicator, **State** = state
variable):

**if(BFI != 0 )**

**State = State + 1;**

**if(State \> 6)**

**State = 6;**

**else**

**State = State \>\> 1;**

In addition to this state machine, the **Bad Frame Flag** from the
previous frame is checked (**prevBFI**). The processing depends on the
value of the **State**-variable. In states 0 and 6, the processing
depends on the **BFI** flag.

The procedure can be described as follows:

6.2 Substitution and muting of erroneous/lost speech frames
-----------------------------------------------------------

### 6.2.1 BFI = 0, prevBFI = 0, State = 0 or 1

No error is detected in the received or in the previous received speech
frame. The received speech parameters are used normally in the speech
synthesis. The current frame of speech parameters is saved.

### 6.2.2 BFI = 0, prevBFI = 1, State = 0 to3

No error is detected in the received speech frame but the previous
received speech frame was bad. The LTP gain is used normally in the
speech synthesis and fixed codebook gain are limited below the values
used for the last received good subframe:

$g^{c}(n) = \begin{matrix}
\left\{ g_{\text{received}}^{c},g_{\text{received}}^{c} \leq \text{100}\text{or}g_{\text{received}}^{c} \leq g^{c}(n - 1) \times 1\text{.}\text{25} \middle| \right.\  \\
\end{matrix}$ (1)

where

$g_{\text{received}}^{c}$ = current decoded fixed codebook-gain\
$g^{c}(n - 1)$ = fixed codebook gain used for the last good subframe
(BFI = 0)\
$g^{c}(n)$ = fixed codebook gain to be used for the current frame.

The rest of the received speech parameters are used normally in the
speech synthesis. The current frame of speech parameters is saved.

### 6.2.3 BFI = 1, prevBFI = 0 or 1, State = 1\...6

An error is detected in the received speech frame and the substitution
and muting procedure is started.

#### 6.2.3.1 LTP gain & fixed codebook gain concealment when RX\_FRAMETYPE = SPEECH\_BAD

The LTP gain $g^{p}$ and fixed codebook gain $g^{c}$ are replaced by
attenuated values from the previous subframes:

$g^{p} = P^{p}(\text{state}) \ast \text{median}5(g^{p}(n - 1),\text{.}\text{.}\text{.},g^{p}(n - 5))$
(2)

$g^{c} = \begin{matrix}
\left\{ P^{c}(\text{state}) \ast \text{median}5(g^{c}(n - 1),\text{.}\text{.}\text{.},g^{c}(n - 5))\text{,VAD\_HIST} \leq 2 \middle| \right.\  \\
\end{matrix}$ (3)

where:

$g^{p}$= current decoded LTP gain,\
$g^{c}$= current decoded fixed codebook gain,\
$g^{p}(n - 1),\text{.}\text{.}\text{.},g^{p}(n - 5)$= LTP gains used for
the last 5 subframes,\
$g^{c}(n - 1),\text{.}\text{.}\text{.},g^{c}(n - 5)$= fixed codebook
gains used for the last 5 subframes,\
*median5()* = 5-point median operation,\
$P^{p}(\text{state})$ = attenuation factor (*P^p^(1)* = 0.98, *P^p^ (2)*
= 0.96, *P^p^ (3)* = 0.75, *P^p^ (4)* = 0.23, *P^p^ (5)* = 0.05,\
*P^p^(6)* = 0.01),\
$P^{c}(\text{state})$ = attenuation factor (*P^c^ (1)* = 0.98, *P^c^
(2)* = 0.98, *P^c^ (3)* = 0.98, *P^c^ (4)* = 0.98, *P^c^ (5)* = 0.98,\
*P^c^ (6)* = 0.70),\
*state* = state number {0..6},\
VAD\_HIST is number of consecutive VAD=0 decisions.

The higher the state value is, the more the gains are attenuated. Also
the memory of the predictive fixed codebook gain is updated by using the
average value of the past four values in the memory:

$\text{ener}\left( 0 \right) = \frac{1}{4}\left\lbrack \sum_{i = 1}^{4}{\text{ener}\left( n - i \right)} \right\rbrack - 3$
(4)

#### 6.2.3.2 LTP gain & fixed codebook gain concealment when RX\_FRAMETYPE = SPEECH\_LOST

The LTP gain $g^{p}$ and fixed codebook gain $g^{c}$ are replaced by
attenuated values from the previous subframes:

$g^{p} = P^{p}(\text{state}) \ast \text{median}5(g^{p}(n - 1),\text{.}\text{.}\text{.},g^{p}(n - 5))$
(5)

$g^{c} = \begin{matrix}
\left\{ P^{c}(\text{state}) \ast \text{median}5(g^{c}(n - 1),\text{.}\text{.}\text{.},g^{c}(n - 5))\text{,VAD\_HIST} \leq 2 \middle| \right.\  \\
\end{matrix}$ (6)

where:

$g^{p}$= current decoded LTP gain,\
$g^{c}$= current decoded fixed codebook gain,\
$g^{p}(n - 1),\text{.}\text{.}\text{.},g^{p}(n - 5)$= LTP gains used for
the last 5 subframes,\
$g^{c}(n - 1),\text{.}\text{.}\text{.},g^{c}(n - 5)$= fixed codebook
gains used for the last 5 subframes,\
*median5()* = 5-point median operation,\
$P^{p}(\text{state})$ = attenuation factor (*P^p^(1)* = 0.95, *P^p^ (2)*
= 0.90, *P^p^ (3 )* = 0.75, *P^p^ (4)* = 0.23, *P^p^ (5)* = 0.05,\
*P^p^ (6)* = 0.01),\
$P^{c}(\text{state})$ = attenuation factor (*P^c^ (1)* = 0.50, *P^c^ (2)
=* 0.25, *P^c^ (3)* = 0.25, *P^c^ (4)* = 0.25, *P^c^ (5)* = 0.15,\
*P^c^ (6)* = 0.01),\
*state* = state number {0..6},\
VAD\_HIST is number of consecutive VAD=0 decisions.

The higher the state value is, the more the gains are attenuated. Also
the memory of the predictive fixed codebook gain is updated by using the
average value of the past four values in the memory:

$\text{ener}\left( 0 \right) = \frac{1}{4}\left\lbrack \sum_{i = 1}^{4}{\text{ener}\left( n - i \right)} \right\rbrack - 3$
(7)

#### 6.2.3.3 ISF concealment

The past ISFs are shifted towards their partly adaptive mean:

$\text{ISF}_{q}(i) = \alpha \ast \text{past}_{\text{ISF}_{q}}(i) + (1 - \alpha) \ast \text{ISF}_{\text{mean}}(i)$
*i = 0..16* (8)

where

$\alpha$ = 0.9,\
$\text{ISF}_{q}(i)$ is ISF-vector for a current frame,\
$\text{past}_{\text{ISF}_{q}}(i)$ is ISF-vector from the previous
frame,\
$\text{ISF}_{\text{mean}}(i)$ vector is combination of adaptive mean and
constant mean ISF-vectors in the following manner:

$\text{ISF}_{\text{mean}}(i) = \beta \ast \text{ISF}_{\text{const}_{\text{mean}}}(i) + (1 - \beta) \ast \text{ISF}_{\text{adaptive}_{\text{mean}}}(i)$*,
i = 0..16* (9)

*where*

$\beta$ = 0.75,\
$\text{ISF}_{\text{adaptive}_{\text{mean}}}(i) = \frac{1}{3}\sum_{i = 0}^{2}{\text{past}_{\text{ISF}_{q}}(i)}$
and is updated whenever BFI =0.\
$\text{ISF}_{\text{const}_{\text{mean}}}(i)$ is a vector containing long
time average of ISF-vectors.

#### 6.2.3.4 LTP-lag concealment 

The histories of five last good LTP-lags and LTP-gains are used for
finding the best method to update.

##### 6.2.3.4.1 LTP-lag concealment when RX\_FRAMETYPE = SPEECH\_BAD

The usability of the received LTP lag
(![](media/image4.wmf){width="0.2916666666666667in"
height="0.2638888888888889in"}) is defined as follows: (Predicts if the
received lag is most probably very close to one that was sent and
therefore its usage should not introduce any bad artifacts)

$$$Q_{\text{lag}} = \begin{matrix}
\left\{ 1,T_{\text{dif}} < \text{10}\text{\ and\ T}_{\text{min}} - 5 < T_{\text{received}} < T_{\text{min}} + 5 \middle| \right.\ \left\{ 1\text{,g}^{p}(n - 1) > 0\text{.}5\text{\ and\ g}^{p}(n - 2) > 0\text{.}5\text{\ and\ T}(\text{n-1})\text{-10} < T_{\text{received}} < T(\text{n-1}) + \text{10} \middle| \right.\ \left\{ 1,g_{\text{min}}^{p} < 0\text{.}4\text{\ and\ }g^{p}(n - 1) = g_{\text{min}}^{p}\text{\ and\ T}_{\text{min}} < T_{\text{received}} < T_{\text{max}} \middle| \right.\ \left\{ 1,T_{\text{dif}} < \text{70}\text{\ and\ \ T}_{\text{min}} < T_{\text{received}} < T_{\text{max}} \middle| \right.\ \left\{ 1,T_{\text{mean}} < T_{\text{received}} < T_{\text{max}} \middle| \right.\  \\
\end{matrix}$ (10)

where:

$T(n - 1)$ is LTP lag from the previous good frame,\
$T_{\text{dif}} = \left| T_{\text{received}} - T(n - 1) \right|$,\
$T_{\text{min}} = \text{min}(T_{\text{buffer}})$,\
$T_{\text{max}} = \text{max}(T_{\text{buffer}})$,\
$T_{\text{received}}$is received lag,\
$g_{\text{min}}^{p} = \text{min}(g_{\text{buffer}}^{p})$,\
$g^{p}$is LTP gain of the current frame,\
$g^{p}$(-1) is LTP gain of the previous good frame,\
$g^{p}$(-2) is LTP gain of the frame before previous good frame,\
$T_{\text{mean}} = \text{average}(T_{\text{buffer}})$

LPT lag value for the current frame is defined as follows:

$T = \begin{matrix}
\left\{ T_{\text{received}}\text{,Q}_{\text{lag}} = 1 \middle| \right.\  \\
\end{matrix}$ (11)

where:\
$T_{\text{max}} = \text{max}(T_{\text{buffer}})$,\
$T_{\text{max} - 1}$is second largest value in $T_{\text{buffer}}$,\
$T_{\text{max} - 2}$is second largest value in $T_{\text{buffer}}$,\
$\text{RND}(x)$is random value generated to range
$\left\lbrack - \frac{x}{2}, + \frac{x}{2} \right\rbrack$

##### 6.2.3.4.2 LTP-lag concealment when RX\_FRAMETYPE = SPEECH\_LOST

The usability of the LTP lag from last good frame
($Q_{\text{lag}_{t} - 1}$) is defined as follows: (Predicts if the
received lag is most probably very close to one that was sent and
therefore its usage should not introduce any bad artifacts)

$Q_{\text{lag}_{t} - 1} = \begin{matrix}
\left\{ 1,g_{\text{min}}^{p} > 0\text{.}5\text{\ and\ T}_{\text{dif}} < \text{10} \middle| \right.\ \left\{ 1,g^{p}(n - 1) > 0\text{.}5\text{\ and\ g}^{p}(n - 2) > 0\text{.}5 \middle| \right.\  \\
\end{matrix}$ (12)

where:

$g_{\text{min}}^{p} = \text{min}(g_{\text{buffer}}^{p})$,\
$g^{p}$(n-1) is LTP gain of the previous good frame,\
$g^{p}$(n-2) is LTP gain of the frame before previous good frame

LPT lag value for the current frame is defined as follows:

$T = \begin{matrix}
\left\{ T(n - 1)\text{,Q}_{\text{lag\_t-1}} = 1 \middle| \right.\  \\
\end{matrix}$ (13)

where:

$T(n - 1)$ is LTP lag from the previous good frame,\
$T_{\text{max}} = \text{max}(T_{\text{buffer}})$,\
$T_{\text{max} - 1}$is second largest value in $T_{\text{buffer}}$,\
$T_{\text{max} - 2}$is second largest value in $T_{\text{buffer}}$,\
$\text{RND}(x)$is random value generated to range
$\left\lbrack - \frac{x}{2}, + \frac{x}{2} \right\rbrack$

### 6.2.4 Innovation sequence

When RX\_FRAMETYPE = SPEECH\_BAD, the received fixed codebook innovation
pulses from the erroneous frame are used as they are received.

When RX\_FRAMETYPE = SPEECH\_LOST, the received fixed codebook
innovation pulses from the erroneous frame are not used and the fixed
codebook innovation vector is filled with random signal (values limited
to\
range \[-1, +1\]).

### 6.2.5 High-band gain (for 23.85 kbit/s mode)

When RX\_FRAMETYPE = SPEECH\_BAD or RX\_FRAMETYPE = SPEECH\_LOST the
received high-band energy parameter of the frame is not used and the
estimation for the high-band gain is used instead. This means that in
case of bad/lost speech frames, the high-band reconstruction operates in
the same way for all the modes.

6.3 Substitution and muting of lost SID frames
----------------------------------------------

In the speech decoder a single frame classified as SID\_BAD shall be
substituted by the last valid SID frame information and the procedure
for valid SID frames be applied. If the time between SID information
updates (updates are specified by SID\_UPDATE arrivals and occasionally
by SID\_FIRST arrivals) is greater than one second this shall lead to
attenuation.
