**Title: Proposed test plan for a Round Robin Test for comparison of
background noise simulations -- Rev. 1**

Document for: Information 
-------------------------

Questions to answer:
--------------------

1.  How good is the reproducibility of the ETSI ES 202 396-1 and ETSI TS
    103 224 background noise (BGN) simulation methods?

2.  Find out whether the different BGN simulation methods lead to
    different S-MOS-LQO and N-MOS-LQO results when measuring the same
    UE.

Noises & Setup
--------------

8 Noises binaural old recordings from ES 202 396-1 (as listed in 3GPP TS
26.132 v12.3.0)

8 Noises binaural new recordings from ES 202 396-1 (compatible to TS 103
224)

8 Noises 8-channel new recordings from TS 103 224

1 silent condition (speech only)

1 new Recordings for table top with call center noise (to be collected
and possibly proposed for inclusion in ETSI database)

Bandwidths
----------

Narrowband & wideband - UMTS

Devices
-------

6 recent commercial devices, covering a variety of noise suppression
solutions and number of microphones.

Rooms
-----

2 rooms each lab (may include anechoic and/or office type)

Analysis
--------
