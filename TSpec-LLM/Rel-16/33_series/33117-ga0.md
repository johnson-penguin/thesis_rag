===========================================================

4.1 Introduction
----------------

### 4.1.1 Pre-requisites for testing 

The SCAS tests, as described in the present specification, are to be
applied to a network product whose software and hardware has been
brought into use so that the network product can provide the intended
functionality, either in a real network environment or in a simulated
environment. This implies that, before any testing is performed, the
hardware and software has been installed correctly, the network product
is powered on, and communication has been established over all
standardized interfaces and OAM interfaces related with the network
product\'s functionality, as described in the vendor\'s documentation.

Communication over external non standardized Interfaces that may exist
and are marked as optional, according to the vendor\'s documentation,
shall also be established during testing unless they are explicitly
marked as \"not recommended\" in the vendor\'s documentation.

For each of the enabled external communication interfaces there may be
various optional capabilities. During testing, all such capabilities
shall be enabled unless they are explicitly marked as \"not
recommended\" in the vendor\'s documentation.

In some cases a testcase might require configuration changes as part of
the execution steps or pre-conditions. After such test is executed and
prior to any further test execution it needs to be ensured that the
state of the ToE is restored back in the original state.

SCAS testing is not about security in operations and deployments. So, in
particular, SCAS testing is independent of any operator guidelines or
considerations on specific deployment scenarios.

### 4.1.2 Use of tools in testing

The following text shall apply to all test cases described in the
present document:

The present document takes into account that the landscape of testing
tools evolves more rapidly than SCAS specifications. It is therefore
allowed that, for each requirement, the actual test carried out may
deviate from the stepwise description of the test case in the present
document if the following conditions are fulfilled:

\(1\) The test is carried out by preferably using
Commercial-of-the-Shelf (COTS) and Free-Open-Source-Software (FOSS)
tools that are available for other testers that may want to repeat the
test. In case a tool not in any of these two categories is used then
evidence of the quality assurance of the tool needs to be provided. This
applies only to tools used to perform the actual test and not supportive
tools needed for setting up the testing environment like for example
traffic generators/ simulators.

> In cases where a test lab is not able to obtain the necessary tools to
> perform the test, vendor proprietary test tools may be used by the
> test lab as long the test tool is controlled under a suitable quality
> management system (QMS). The test lab ensures that this QMS is in
> place in order to avail of a vendor's test tool.
>
> Additionally in cases where the accredited test lab does not have the
> necessary test environment to perform a test, it shall be possible for
> the accredited test lab personnel to perform the test in a vendor\'s
> test lab. In such cases the accredited lab should record details of
> test environment, test set-up used and how the test was performed.

\(2\) The tester provides evidence, e.g. by referring to the
documentation of the tool, that the tool is suitable to verify the
requirement, and the scope of testing is equal or larger to the one of
the test case described in the present document. The evidence needs to
be sufficiently detailed for experts in the field of testing, not for
the general public.

\(3\) The tester provides evidence that the tool has been actually used
for testing the network product (e.g. by providing a trace).

### 4.1.3 Documentation Requirements 

When a test case makes an assumption on the availability of certain
items in the product documentation then this assumption is to be
considered part of the requirement even if the requirements text does
not mention the documentation.

4.2 Security functional requirements and related test cases
-----------------------------------------------------------

### 4.2.1 Introduction

The present clause describes the security functional requirements and
the corresponding test cases, independent of a specific network product
class. In particular the proposed security requirements are classified
in two groups:

\- Security functional requirements deriving from 3GPP specifications
and detailed in clause 4.2.2

\- General security functional requirements which include requirements
not already addressed in the 3GPP specifications but whose support is
also important to ensure a network product conforms to a common security
baseline detailed in clause 4.2.3.

### 4.2.2 Security functional requirements deriving from 3GPP specifications and related test cases

#### 4.2.2.1 Security functional requirements deriving from 3GPP specifications -- general approach

The present clause describes the general approach taken towards security
functional requirements deriving from 3GPP specifications and the
corresponding test cases, independent of a specific network product
class.

It is assumed for the purpose of the present SCAS that a network product
conforms to all mandatory security-related provisions in 3GPP
specifications pertaining to it, in particular:

\- all 3GPP specifications of the 33-series (security specifications)
that are pertinent to the network product class;

\- other 3GPP specifications that make reference to security
specifications or are referred to from one of them.

3GPP has decided to develop test specifications for the UE in the TSs of
the 34-series under the responsibility of Working Group RAN5. 3GPP saw,
however, no need to develop test specifications for network elements.
For network elements, 3GPP rather trusts that tests are run under the
responsibility of the vendors.

Security procedures pertaining to a network product are typically
embedded in non-security procedures and are hence assumed to be tested
together with them.

It is the purpose of the present SCAS to identify security requirements
from the EPS and 5G security architecture that require special attention
in testing as they may:

\(a\) lead to vulnerabilities when not satisfied;

\(b\) not be captured through ordinary testing activity for non-security
procedures;

\(c\) address security-relevant failure cases and exceptions or
\'negative\' requirements of the kind: \"The network product shall
not...\"

It is not an intention of the present document to provide an exhaustive
set of test cases that would be sufficient to demonstrate conformance of
all security procedures with the above-mentioned specifications.

#### 4.2.2.*2* Security functional requirements derived from 3GPP specifications -- general SBA/SBI aspects

##### 4.2.2.*2*.1 Introduction

The purpose of the sub-clauses in 4.2.2.2 is to identify and describe
the general baseline requirements from SBA security architecture and the
corresponding test cases. The general baseline requirements are
applicable to all Network Function (NF) within the 5G Core (5GC)
utilizing Service-Based Interfaces (SBI), independent of a specific
network product class.

##### 4.2.2.*2*.2 Protection at the transport layer

*Requirement Name:* Protection at the transport layer

*Requirement Reference:* TS 33.501 \[10\], clause 5.9.2.1, clause 13.1,
clause 13.3.2

*Requirement Description*:

\"NF Service Request and Response procedure shall support mutual
authentication between NF consumer and NF producer\" as specified in TS
33.501 \[10\], clause 5.9.2.1;

\"All network functions shall support TLS. Network functions shall
support both server-side and client-side certificates.

The TLS profile shall follow the profile given in Annex E of TS 33.310
\[9\] with the restriction that it shall be compliant with the profile
given by HTTP/2 as defined in RFC 7540 \[11\]. \"

as specified in TS 33.501 \[10\], clause 13.1.

\"Authentication between network functions within one PLMN shall use one
of the following methods:

\- If the PLMN uses protection at the transport layer as described in
clause 13.1, authentication provided by the transport layer protection
solution shall be used for authentication between NFs.\"

as specified in TS 33.501 \[10\], clause 13.3.2.

*Threat References*: TR 33.926 \[4\], clause 5.3.6.3, Weak cryptographic
algorithms

*Test case*:

**Test Name:** TC\_PROTECT\_TRANSPORT\_LAYER

**Purpose:**

Verify that TLS protocol for NF mutual authentication and NF transport
layer protection is implemented in the network products based on the
profile required.

**Procedure and execution steps:**

**Pre-Conditions:**

Network product documentation containing information about supported TLS
protocol and certificates is provided by the vendor.

A peer implementing the TLS protocol configured by the vendor shall be
available.

The tester shall base the tests on the profile defined by 3GPP in Annex
E of TS 33.310 \[9\] with the restriction that it shall be compliant
with the profile given by HTTP/2 as defined in RFC 7540 \[11\].

**Execution Steps**

1\. The tester shall check that compliance with the TLS profile can be
inferred from detailed provisions in the network product documentation.

2\. The tester shall establish a secure connection between the network
product under test and the peer and verify that all TLS protocol
versions and combinations of cryptographic algorithms that are mandated
by the TLS profile are supported by the network product under test.

3\. The tester shall try to establish a secure connection between the
network product under test and the peer and verify that this is not
possible when the peer only offers a feature, including protocol version
and combination of cryptographic algorithms, that is forbidden by the
TLS profile.

**Expected Results:**

\- The network product under test and the peer establish TLS if the TLS
profiles used by the peer are compliant with the profile requirements in
TS 33.310 \[9\] Annex E and RFC 7540 \[11\].

\- The network product under test and the peer fail to establish TLS if
the TLS profiles used by the peer are forbidden in TS 33.310 \[9\] Annex
E or RFC 7540 \[11\].

**Expected format of evidence:**

Provide evidence of the check of the product documentation in plain
text. Save the logs and the communication flow in a .pcap file.

##### 4.2.2.*2*.3 Authorization of NF service access

###### 4.2.2.*2*.3.1 Authorization token verification failure handling wthin one PLMN

*Requirement Name*: Authorization token verification failure handling
wthin one PLMN

*Requirement Reference:* TS 33.501 \[10\], clause 13.4.1.1

*Requirement Description*:

\"13.4.1.1 Service access authorization within the PLMN

2\. The NF Service producer shall verify the access token as follows:

\- The NF Service producer ensures the integrity of the access token by
verifying the signature using NRF's public key or checking the MAC value
using the shared secret. If integrity check is successful, the NF
Service producer shall verify the claims in the access token as follows:

NOTE: Void.

\- It checks that the audience claim in the access token matches its own
identity or the type of NF service producer.

\- If scope is present, it checks that the scope matches the requested
service operation.

\- It checks that the access token has not expired by verifying the
expiration time in the access token against the current data/time.

3\. If the verification is successful, the NF Service producer shall
execute the requested service and responds back to the NF Service
consumer. Otherwise it shall reply based on Oauth 2.0 error response
defined in RFC 6749 \[43\].\"

*Threat References*: TR 33.926 \[4\], clause 6.3.3.1, Incorrect
Verification of Access Tokens

*Test Case*:

**Test Name:**
TC\_AUTHORIZATION\_TOKEN\_VERIFICATION\_FAILURE\_ONE\_PLMN

**Purpose:**

> Verify that the NF service producer does not grant service access if
> the verification of authorization token from a NF service consumer in
> the same PLMN fails.

**Procedure and execution steps:**

> **Pre-Conditions:**

\- Test environment with a NF service consumer.

\- The NF service consumer may be simulated.

\- The network product under test has already mutually authenticated
with the NF service consumer.

\- The tester shall have access to the interface between the NF service
consumer and the network product under test.

\- The tester has the NRF's private key or the shared key.

\- The network product under test is preconfigured with the NRF's public
key or the shared key.

> **Execution Steps**
>
> The network product under test receives the access token sent from the
> NF service consumer, verifies the access token based on Oauth 2.0.
>
> Test Case 1: Verification failure of the access token integrity

1\) The tester computes an access token correctly, except that the
signature or the MAC is incorrect, e.g., the signature or the MAC is
randomly selected, and then includes the access token in the NF Service
Request sent from the NF service consumer to the network product under
test.

2\) The integrity verification of the access token by the network
product under test fails.

> Test Case 2: Incorrect audience claim in the access token

1\) The tester computes an access token correctly, except that the
audience claim is incorrect, i.e., the audience claim in the access
token does not match the identity or the type of the network product

sent from NF service consumer to the network product under test.

2\) The network product under test verifies that the audience claim in
the access token does not match its identity or type.

> Test Case 3: Incorrect scope claim in the access token

1\) The tester computes an access token correctly, except that the scope
is incorrect, i.e., the scope does not match the requested service
operation, and then includes the access token in the NF Service Request

### 4.2.3 Technical baseline

#### 4.2.3.1 Introduction

The technical baseline is a generic set of security requirements to be
fulfilled by all network products.

In particular these requirements counter the security threats and
objectives identified in the TR 33.926 \[4\] and they basically aim to
guarantee the network product confidentiality, integrity and
availability.

#### 4.2.3.2 Protecting data and information

##### 4.2.3.2.1 Protecting data and information -- general

Adequate security measures for protecting sensitive data shall be
implemented as defined in the present document. Further measures (that
are beyond the scope of the present document) may be required by local
regulation depending on the classification of the data and other factors
such as type of network used during transmission, storage location for
data, etc.

##### 4.2.3.2.2 Protecting data and information -- Confidential System Internal Data

*Requirement Name*: Unauthorized Viewing

*Requirement Description*: When the system is not under maintenance,
there shall be no system function that reveals confidential system
internal data in the clear to users and administrators. Such functions
could be, for example, local or remote OAM CLI or GUI, logging messages,
alarms, configuration file exports etc. Confidential system internal
data contains authentication data (i.e. PINs, cryptographic keys,
passwords, cookies) as well as system internal data that is not required
for systems administration and could be of advantage to attackers (i.e.
stack traces in error messages).

*Security Objective references*: tba.

*Test case*:

**Test Name**: TC\_CONFIDENTIAL\_SYSTEM\_INTERNAL\_DATA

**Purpose:**

Verify that no system function reveals sensitive data in the clear

**Procedure and execution steps:**

**Pre-Condition:**

The vendor shall provide documentation describing how confidential
system internal information that could possibly be revealed in
clear-text is handled by system functions.

A list of all system functions in the network product, information on
how to enable and execute them should be provided as a part of the
vendor\'s documentation. A system function is every function implemented
in the network product needed by the services/functionalities provided
by the network product itself.

**Execution Steps**

**Execute the following steps:**

1\. Review the documentation provided by the vendor describing how
confidential system internal information is handled by system functions.

2\. The tester checks whether any system functions as described in the
product documentation (e.g. local or remote OAM CLI or GUI, logging
messages, alarms, error messages, configuration file exports, stack
traces) reveal any confidential system internal data in the clear (for
example, passphrases).

**Expected Results:**

There should be no confidential system internal data revealed in the
clear by any system function.

**Expected format of evidence:**

Evidence suitable for the interface, e.g. screenshot containing the
operational results.

##### 4.2.3.2.3 Protecting data and information in storage

*Requirement Name*: Protecting data and information in storage

*Requirement Description*:

For sensitive data in (persistent or temporary) storage read access
rights shall be restricted. Files of a system that are needed for the
functionality shall be protected against manipulation.

In addition, the following rules apply for:

\- Systems that need access to identification and authentication data in
the clear, e.g. in order to perform an authentication. Such systems
shall not store this data in the clear, but scramble or encrypt it by
implementation-specific means.

\- Systems that do not need access to sensitive data (e.g. user
passwords) in the clear. Such systems shall hash this sensitive data .

\- Stored files on the network product: examples for protection against
manipulation are the use of checksum or cryptographic methods.

*Security Objective references:* tba

*Test case:*

**Test Name**: TC\_PSW\_STOR\_SUPPORT

**Purpose:**

Verify that Password storage use one-way hash algorithm.

**Procedure and execution steps:**

> **Pre-Conditions:**

\- The tester can access the storage of own user account password.

\- The tester has privileges to change the password.

\- The original password is P1.

> **Execution Steps**

1\. The tester accesses the storage where the result of P1 is, and the
corresponding hash value is recorded as A

2\. The tester changes the password with P2, then the tester records the
storage hash value of the new password as B

3\. The tester repeats the step 2 to get other records.

> 4\. The tester verifies whether all the records comply with the
> characteristic of one-way hash result.
>
> **Expected Results:**

All records comply with the characteristic of one-way hash result.

> **Expected format of evidence:**

Evidence suitable for the interface, e.g. screenshot containing the
operation results.

##### 4.2.3.2.4 Protecting data and information in transfer

*Requirement Name*: tba

*Requirement Description*:

\- Usage of cryptographically protected network protocols is required.

\- The transmission of data with a need of protection shall use industry
standard network protocols with sufficient security measures and
industry accepted algorithms. In particular, a protocol version without
known vulnerabilities or a secure alternative shall be used.

*Security Objective references*: tba

*Test case*:

**Test Name:** TC\_PROTECT\_DATA\_INFO\_TRANSFER\_1

**Purpose:**

Verify the mechanisms implemented to protect data and information in
transfer to and from the Network Product\'s OAM interface.

NOTE: The test is limited to the OAM interface although the requirement
does not have this limitation because the protection of standardised
interfaces will be covered by regular interoperability testing and the
proprietary use of HTTPS is covered in clause 4.2.5.1.

**Procedure and execution steps:**

**Pre-Conditions:**

Network product documentation containing information about supported OAM
protocols is provided by the vendor,

A peer implementing the security protocol configured by the vendor (e.g.
SSH client supporting SSHv2 or HTTPS client) shall be available.

Network product documentation stating which security protocols for
protection of data in transit are implemented and which profiles in TS
33.310 \[9\] and TS 33.210 \[X\] are applicable is provided by the
vendor

For TLS, the tester shall base the tests on the profile defined by 3GPP
in TS 33.310 \[9\]. For IKE and IPsec, the tester shall base the tests
on the profile defined by 3GPP in TS 33.210 \[X\]. For protocols, for
which 3GPP did not define a security profile, e.g. SSH, the tester shall
base the tests on a widely recognised and publicly available security
profile.

**Execution Steps**

1\. The tester shall check that compliance with the selected security
profile can be inferred from detailed provisions in the product
documentation.

2\. The tester shall establish a secure connection between the network
product and the peer and verify that all protocol versions and
combinations of cryptographic algorithms that are mandated by the
security profile are supported by the network product.

3\. The tester shall try to establish a secure connection between the
network product and the peer and verify that this is not possible when
the peer only offers a feature, including protocol version and
combination of cryptographic algorithms, that is forbidden by the
security profile.

**Expected Results:**

The traffic is properly protected, and insecure options are not accepted
by the Network Product.

**Expected format of evidence:**

Provide evidence of the check of the product documentation in plain
text. Save the logs and the communication flow in a .pcap file.

##### 4.2.3.2.5 Logging access to personal data

*Requirement Name*: Logging access to personal data

*Requirement Description*:

In some cases access to personal data in clear text might be required.
If such access is required, access to this data shall be logged, and the
log shall contain who accessed what data without revealing personal data
in clear text. When for practical purposes such logging is not
available, a coarser grain logging is allowed.

In some cases, the personal data stored in the log files may allow the
direct identification of a subscriber. In such cases, the revealed
personal information may not expose the subscriber to any kind of
privacy violation.

*Test case*:

**Test Name**: TC\_LOGGING\_ACCESS\_TO\_PERSONAL\_DATA

**Purpose:**

Verify that in cases where a network product presents personal data in
clear text, access attempts to such data are logged and the log
information includes the user identity that has accessed the data. The
test case also verifies that the personal data itself is not included in
clear text in the log.

**Procedure and execution steps:**

> **Pre-Conditions:**

A document which provides a description of where personal data in clear
text is accessible on the network product, how it can be accessed, and
details of where such access attempts are logged and how to view these
logs.

> **Execution Steps**

\- The tester verifies, for cases where personal data is accessible in
clear text, that attempts to access it are recorded in a log, that the
log includes the identity of the user that has attempted to access the
data, and that the log does not include the actual personal data in
clear-text.

\- The tester repeats the check for each case where personal data is
accessible.

**Expected Results:**

All access attempts to personal data (in clear text) are recorded in the
described logs, with the user identity included and no personal data
visible in the log.

**Expected format of evidence:**

Sample copies of the log files.

#### 4.2.3.3 Protecting availability and integrity

##### 4.2.3.3.1 System handling during overload situations 

*Requirement Name*: System handling during overload situations

*- Requirement Description:*

The system shall provide security measures to deal with overload
situations which may occur as a result of a denial of service attack or
during periods of increased traffic, or reach the congestion threshold.
In particular, partial or complete impairment of system availability
shall be avoided. Potential protective measures include:

\- Restricting available RAM per application.

\- Restricting maximum sessions for a Web application.

\- Defining the maximum size of a dataset.

\- Restricting CPU resources per process.

\- Prioritizing processes.

\- Overload control method, e.g. limiting amount or size of transactions
of a user or from an IP address in a specific time range.

\- *Security Objective references*: tba.

*Test case*: Refer to test case in clauseÂ 4.2.3.3.3.

##### 4.2.3.3.2 Boot from intended memory devices only

*Requirement name*: Boot from intended memory devices only

*Requirement reference*: to be done later

*Requirement Description*:

The network product can boot only from the memory devices intended for
this purpose.

*Test case*:

**Test Name:** TC\_BOOT\_INT\_MEM\_1

**Purpose:**

Verify that the network product can only boot from memory devices
intended for this purpose (e.g. not from external memory like USB key).

**Procedure and execution steps:**

**Pre-Conditions:**

A document which contains information regarding the firmware access
mechanism supported by the product and about the memory devices from
which the network product can boot.

**Execution Steps**

1\. The tester verifies that the network product is configured to boot
from memory devices declared in the network product document only.

2\. The tester verifies that there is no possibility to access and
modify the firmware of the network product without successful
authentication.

**Expected Results:**

The network product cannot boot from a memory device that is not
configured in its firmware, and access to the firmware is only possible
with the correct authentication.

**Expected format of evidence: NA**

##### 4.2.3.3.3 System handling during excessive overload situations

*Requirement Name*: System handling during excessive overload situations

*Requirement Description*: The system shall act in a predictable way if
an overload situation cannot be prevented. A system shall be built in
this way that it can react on an overload situation in a controlled way.
However it is possible that a situation happens where the security
measures are no longer sufficient.

In such case it shall be ensured that the system cannot reach an
undefined and thus potentially insecure state. In an extreme case this
means that a controlled system shutdown is preferable to uncontrolled
failure of the security functions and thus loss of system protection.

The vendor shall provide a technical description of the network
product\'s Over Load Control mechanisms (especially whether these
mechanisms rely on cooperation of other network elements e.g. eNode B)
and the accompanying test case for this requirement will check that the
description provides sufficient detail in order for an evaluator to
understand how the mechanism is designed.

*Security Objective references*: tba.

product uses to trigger overload control mechanisms.

\- Description of the types of attacks that may cause an overload to the
network product and how these are handled.

\- A description of how the network product discards or handles input
during various overload situations including excessive overloads. i.e.
where the overload is significantly greater than the thresholds where
overload detection is triggered.

\- A description of how the network product security functions operate
and perform during overload.

\- A description of how the network product shuts down or performs or

Note: If some of the items listed above are not applicable to a network
product then, in those cases, it should be clarified by the vendor why
these items are not applicable.

The test results should:

\- Contain details of the overload conditions used in the test execution
that are consistent with the technical description document.

\- Describe the test procedures used to verify the overload control
mechanisms.

\- Contain data which demonstrates/indicates that the overload control
mechanisms described in the technical description document have been
implemented.

\- Contain details of the test set-up including the mechanisms for
creating the overload.

**Expected format of evidence:**

on the network product, that the software package integrity check is
executed (check for evidence of execution as described in network
product documentation) and that valid software is allowed to be
installed but invalid software is rejected.

The tester checks the access control permissions for the software
package integrity checking process, the list of public keys of
authorised software sources, and any related credentials or keys for the
process, to ensure that the process cannot be controlled by persons that
are not authorized to do so.

without successful authentication and authorization.

*Requirement Description*:

The usage of a system function without successful authentication on
basis of the user identity and at least one authentication attribute
(e.g. password, certificate) shall be prevented. System functions
comprise, for example network services (like SSH, SFTP, Web services),
local access via a management console, local usage of operating system
and applications. This requirement shall also be applied to accounts
that are only used for communication between systems. An exception to
the authentication and authorization requirement are functions for
public use such as those for a Web server on the Internet, via which
information is made available to the public.

*Security Objective references*: tba.

*Test case*:

**Test Name**: TC\_SYS\_FUN\_USAGE

**Purpose:**

To ensure that system functions shall not be used without successful
authentication and authorization.

**Procedure and execution steps:**

**Pre-Conditions:**

1\. The manufacturer shall supply the list of system functions which
include network services, local access via a management console, local
usage of operating system and applications.

2\. The manufacturer shall supply the list of access entries for system
functions.

following steps:

1\. The tester verifies, based on his/her own experience, that the list
is adequate.

2\. The tester verifies that the access entries to use system functions,
which are listed by the manufacturer, require successful authentication
on basis of the user name and at least one authentication attribute.
This applies to both system functions that are locally accessible and
those that are remotely accessible via a network interface.

**Expected Results:**

1\. The network product does not allow access to any system function
provided by the manufacturer without a successful user authentication.

**Expected format of evidence:**

A testing report provided by the testing agency which will consist of
the following information:

\- Description of executed tests and commands

\- Relevant output (e.g. Screenshot)

##### 4.2.3.4.1.2 Accounts shall allow unambiguous identification of the user. {#accounts-shall-allow-unambiguous-identification-of-the-user. .H6}

*Requirement name:* The network product shall use accounts that allow
unambiguous identification of the user.

*Requirement Description*: Users shall be identified unambiguously by
the network product. The network product shall support assignment of
individual accounts per user, where a user could be a person, or, for
Machine Accounts, an application, or a system. The network product shall
not enable the use of group accounts or group credentials, or sharing of
the same account between several users, by default. The network product
shall support a minimum number of 50 individual accounts per user data
base if not explicitly specified in a SCAS of a particular network
product, so that accountability for each user is ensured even in large
operator networks. The network product shall not support user access
credentials unrelated to an account.

NOTE 1: The network product may support independent user data bases for
different access methods, e.g. one data base for command shell access on
OS level and another data base for GUI access. User data bases may be
stored locally on the network product or on a central AAA system that
the network product accesses for user authentication.

NOTE 2: This requirement does not preclude user group concepts for
access control.

*Security Objective references*: tba.

*Test case*:

NOTE 3: Some typical default accounts suggest that they are shared
amongst several persons (e.g. vendor\_xy, support), or do not allow
identification of individual users (e.g. guest, ftp, anonymous). In
order to avoid overlap of this test case with clause 4.2.3.4.2.2, it is
assumed for this test case that such accounts have been deleted or
disabled in line with clause 4.2.3.4.2.2.

**Test Name**: TC\_ACCOUNT\_DOCUMENTATION

Authentication attributes include:

\- Cryptographic keys

\- Token

\- Passwords

This means that authentication based on a parameter that can be spoofed
(e.g. phone numbers, public IP addresses or VPN membership) is not
permitted. Exceptions are attributes that cannot be faked or spoofed by
an attacker.

NOTE: Several of the above options can be combined (dual-factor
authentication) to achieve a higher level of security. Whether or not
this is suitable and necessary depends on the protection needs of the
individual system and its data and is evaluated for individual cases.

##### 4.2.3.4.2.2 Predefined accounts shall be deleted or disabled. {#predefined-accounts-shall-be-deleted-or-disabled. .H6}

*Requirement Name:* Predefined accounts shall be deleted or disabled.

*Requirement Description:* All predefined or default accounts shall be
deleted or disabled. Many systems have default accounts (e.g. guest,
ctxsys), some of which are preconfigured with or without known
passwords. These standard users shall be deleted or disabled. Should
this measure not be possible the accounts shall be locked for remote
login. In any case disabled or locked accounts shall be configured with
a complex password as specified in clause 4.2.3.4.3.1 Password
Structure. This is necessary to prevent unauthorized use of such an
account in case of misconfiguration.

Exceptions to this requirement to delete or disable accounts are
accounts that are used only internally on the system involved and that
are required for one or more applications on the system to function.
Also for these accounts remote access or local login shall be forbidden
to prevent abusive use by users of the system.

*Security Objective references*: TBA.

the vendor before any operator-specific configuration has been applied.
The special characters may be categorized in sets according to their
Unicode category.

The network product shall at least support passwords of a length of 64
characters or a length greater than 64 characters.

If a central system is used for user authentication, password policy is
performed on the central system and additional assurance shall be
provided that the central system enforces the same password complexity
rules as laid down for the local system in this subclause. If a central
system is not used for user authentication, the assurance on password
complexity rules shall be performed on the Network Product.

When a user is changing a password or entering a new password, the
system checks and ensures that it meets the password requirements. Above

##### 4.2.3.4.3.3 Protection against brute force and dictionary attacks {#protection-against-brute-force-and-dictionary-attacks .H6}

*Requirement Name*: Protection against brute force and dictionary
attacks

*Requirement Description*:

If a password is used as an authentication attribute, a protection
against brute force and dictionary attacks that hinder password guessing
shall be implemented.

Brute force and dictionary attacks aim to use automated guessing to
ascertain passwords for user and machine accounts. Various measures or a
combination of these measures can be taken to prevent this.

The most commonly used protection measures are:

1\) Using the timer delay (this delay could be the same or increased
depending the operator\'s policy for each attempt, e.g. double the
delay, or 5 minutes delay, or 10 minutes delay) for each newly entered
password input following an incorrect entry (\"tar pit\").

2\) Blocking an account following a specified number of incorrect
attempts, refer to 4.2.3.4.5. However it has to be taken into account
that this solution needs a process for unlocking and an attacker can
force this to deactivate accounts and make them unusable.

3\) Using CAPTCHA to prevent automated attempts (often used for Web
applications).

4\) Using a password blacklist to prevent vulnerable passwords.

NOTE 1: Password management and blacklist configuration may be done in a
separate node that is different to the node under test, e.g. a SSO
server or any other central credential manager.

In order to achieve higher security, it is often meaningful to combine
two or more of the measures named here. It is left to the vendor to
select appropriate measures.

Above requirements shall be applicable for all passwords used (e.g.
application-level, OS-level, etc.). An exception to this requirement is
machine accounts.

*Security Objective references*: tba.

*Test case*:

**Test Name**:
TC\_PROTECT\_AGAINST\_BRUTE\_FORCE\_AND\_DICTIONARY\_ATTACKS

This test applies only when the most commonly used protection measures
used in the requirement are implemented. If they are not implemented,
then the vendor documentation needs to provide alternative measures and
the tester needs to develop suitable tests for these alternative
measures. Since a vendor is free to select appropriate measures, only
the vendor selected measures are to be tested.

**Purpose:**

To ensure that the system uses a mechanism with adequate protection
against brute force and dictionary attacks

To check whether system follows commonly used preventive measures which
are mentioned below.

1\. Using the timer delay (e.g. doubling wait times after every
incorrect attempt, or 5 minutes delay, or 10 minutes delay) after each
incorrect password input (\"tar pit\").

2\. Blocking an account following a specified number of incorrect
attempts (typically 5). However administrator has to keep in account
that this solution needs a process for unlocking and an attacker can
utilize this process to deactivate the accounts and make them unusable.

3\. Using CAPTCHA to prevent automated attempts (often used for Web
interface).

4\. Using a password blacklist to prevent vulnerable passwords.

**Procedure and execution steps:**

**Pre-Conditions:**

1\. The password policy management of the network product is configured
to use the timer delay after each incorrect password input.

2\. The password policy management is configured to block an account
following a specified number of incorrect password attempts (typically
5).

3\. The web interface should be configured with CAPTCHA feature to
prevent automated attempts.

4\. CAPTCHA feature is optional and test is done only if implemented.

5\. A password blacklist is configured by the tester. At least one
blacklisted password (a password that meets the complexity criteria but
is blacklisted) is documented.

NOTE 2: Password management and blacklist configuration may be done in a
separate node that is different to the node under test, e.g. a SSO
server or any other central credential manager.

6\. Tester has valid credentials as an authorized user.

**Execution Steps**

Execute the following steps:

A. Positive Test

Case 1:

Test case to use the timer delay after each incorrect password input is
covered in clause 4.2.3.4.5.

attempts is covered in clause 4.2.3.4.5.

Case 3:

1\. The network product\'s login web interface is configured with
CAPTCHA feature.

2\. Tester enters the valid password and correct CAPTCHA

3\. Tester can successfully log into the network product.

In some cases the network product class can have two or more of the
attack prevention methods available, which are a combination of Cases
1-3. In such cases the tester will need to run a combination of these
test cases.

B. Negative Test

Case 1:

Test case to use the timer delay after each incorrect password input is
covered in clause 4.2.3.4.5.

Case 2:

Test case to block an account following a specified number of incorrect

### 4.2.4 Operating systems

#### 4.2.4.1 General operating system requirements and related test cases

##### 4.2.4.1.1 Availability and Integrity

##### 4.2.4.1.1.1 Handling of growing content {#handling-of-growing-content .H6}

*Requirement Name*: Growing (dynamic) content shall not influence system
functions.

*Requirement Description*:

Growing or dynamic content (e.g. log files, uploads) shall not influence
system functions. A file system that reaches its maximum capacity shall
not stop a system from operating properly. Therefore, countermeasures
shall be taken such as usage of dedicated filesystems, separated from
main system functions, or quotas, or at least a file system monitoring
to ensure that this scenario is avoided.

*Test Case*:

**Test Name: TC\_HANDLING\_OF\_GROWING\_CONTENT**

**Purpose:**

To verify that the growing or dynamic content does not influence system
functions.

**Procedure and execution steps:**

**Pre-Conditions:**

1\. Growing or dynamic content sources like e.g. log files and their
paths are documented.

2\. Measures that are taken to protect system functions from growing or
dynamic content that may exhaust file system capacity are documented.

3\. All logging capabilities that are not enabled by default are enabled
manually as per the documentation instructions.

**Execution Steps**

1\. Tester checks that the sources that are susceptible to being
exhausted have been documented and measures aimed to counteract this are
described.

2\. Tester enables monitoring of the system operation.

3\. Tester initiates traffic that causes increase of log files and
monitors the system behaviour until the log file either reaches its
quota or until file system is exhausted.

4\. In case file uploading is allowed (e.g. via SFTP) the tester
initiates file uploading and tries to exhaust the file system.

**Expected Results:**

1\. It is verified that the taken measures are sufficient so that system
operation is not influenced by growing or dynamic content at any case.

**Expected format of evidence:**

System monitoring data (e.g. Alarms, logs, CPU utilization, etc.).

##### 4.2.4.1.1.2 Handling of ICMP {#handling-of-icmp .H6}

*Requirement Name*: Processing of ICMPv4 and ICMPv6 packets

*Requirement Description*:

*Test Case*:

The test for this requirement can be carried out using a suitable tool
or manually by performing the steps described below. If a tool is used
then the tester needs to provide evidence, e.g. by referring to the
documentation of the tool, that the tool actually provides functionality
equivalent to the steps described below.

**Test Name:** TC\_HANDLING\_OF\_ICMP

**Purpose:**

To verify that the network product does not reply to certain ICMP types
in accordance with the requirement. To verify that the network product
does not send \'Time Exceeded\'.

To verify that the network product does not process the following ICMPv4
and ICMPv6 types:

\- \"Redirect (5)\"

\- Router Solicitation

\- Router Advertisement

**Procedure and execution steps:**

**Pre-Conditions:**

\- The tester knows whether the network product supports IPv4 and/or
IPv6:

\- If applicable, the tester has the needed system privileges for
confirming that the ICMP messages with types \"Not Permitted\" to
process are indeed not leading to configuration changes..

\- If applicable, the tester has the needed system privileges for
confirming that certain ICMP message types are dropped by the network
product on receipt.

\- A tester machine is available and equipped with a suitable ICMP
packets generator tool.

**Execution Steps**

The following needs to be done for all IP protocol versions (IPv4 and/or
IPv6) supported by the network element.

For verifying that the network product does not reply to ICMP messages
with types where this is not permitted: The tester sends samples of the
applicable ICMP messages from the tester machine to the network product
and verifies by appropriate means that

\- the messages are dropped on receipt by the network product (e.g. by
means of appropriate firewall rules),

\- or no response is sent out towards the test machine,

\- or there are other means ensuring that the ICMP messages cannot
trigger a response.

For verifying that the network product does not change its configuration
due to receiving ICMP messages with types where this is not permitted:
The tester sends samples of the applicable ICMP messages from the tester
machine to the network product and verifies by appropriate means that

\- the messages are dropped on receipt by the network product (e.g. by
means of appropriate firewall rules),

\- or the network product\'s applicable system configuration remains
unchanged upon receipt of the messages,

\- or there are other means ensuring that the ICMP messages cannot lead
to configuration changes.

The tester utilizes appropriate means to verify consistency between the
documentation in regard to ICMP and the network product.

**Expected Results:**

The ICMP messages which are \"Not Permitted\" to generate a response
from the network product do not generate a response.

The ICMP messages which are \"Not Permitted\" to change the
configuration of the network element do not change the configuration.

ICMP message types which lead to responses or to configuration changes
on receipt, if neither mentioned in the requirement nor in the
documentation, are not enabled.

**Expected format of evidence:**

The following information needs to be retained and included into the
report as appropriate:

\- Tools used and their configuration

\- Tool output

\- Test result (Passed or not)

##### 4.2.4.1.1.3 Handling of IP options and extensions {#handling-of-ip-options-and-extensions .H6}

*Requirement Name*: IP packets with unnecessary options or extension
headers shall not be processed.

*Requirement Description*:

IP packets with unnecessary options or extension headers shall not be
processed. IP options and extension headers (e.g. source routing) are
only required in exceptional cases. So, all packets with enabled IP
options or extension headers shall be filtered.

*Test Case*:

The test for this requirement can be carried out using a suitable tool
or manually by performing the steps described below. If a tool is used
then the tester needs to provide evidence, e.g. by referring to the
documentation of the tool, that the tool actually provides functionality
equivalent to the steps described below.

**Test Name**: TC\_HANDLING-IP-OPTIONS-AND-EXTENSIONS

**Purpose:** To verify that the network product provides functionality
to filter out IP packets with unnecessary options or extension headers.

**Procedure and execution steps:**

**Pre-Conditions:**

\- The manufacturer declares in the documentation accompanying the
network product at least the following information:

> \- The support of filtering capability for IP packets with unnecessary
> options or extensions headers.
>
> \- The actions performed by the network product when an IP packet with
> unnecessary options or extensions headers is received (e.g. the packet
> is dropped, the options or extensions are ignored and the packet is
> treated as if it has no IP options, etc.) .
>
> \- Guidelines on how to enable and configure this filtering
> capability.

\- The network product has at least one physical interface named if1
supporting both IPv4 and IPv6. If the network product does not support
IPv6 then IPv6 related steps and checks may be skipped**.**

\- A network traffic analyser on the network product (e.g. TCPDUMP) or
an external traffic analyser directly connected to the network product
is available .

\- The tester has administrative privileges.

\- A tester machine is available with a tool able to send IPv4 packets
with the IP Options and IPv6 packets (if supported by the network
product) with Extension Header set (e.g. Scapy).

**Execution Steps**

1\. The tester logs in the network product.

2\. The tester configures on the network product a filtering rule to
drop all IP packets containing an IP Option set

> a\) The tester establishes an O&M session on if1 interface
>
> b\) Using the tool (e.g. Scapy) the tester sends from the tester
> machine an IPv4 TCP SYN packet with an appropriate destination portto
> if1 interface without setting any IP Options
>
> c\) Using the network traffic analyser, the tester verifies that the
> IP packet is received by the network product and the tester verifies
> that the corresponding ACK message is sent back.
>
> d\) Using the tool (e.g. Scapy) the tester sends an IPv4 TCP SYN
> packet with an appropriate destination port and an IP Option set to
> the if1 interface
>
> e\) Using the network traffic analyser, the tester verifies that the
> IP packet is received by the network product but no ACK message is
> sent back. This confirms the packet is dropped as expected from the
> filtering rule.

3\. The tester configures on the network product a filtering rule to
drop all incoming packets based on specific Extension Header Types, e.g.
packets with the Routing Header extension. Step 3 may be skipped if the
network product does not support IPv6.

> a\) Using the tool (e.g. Scapy) the tester sends from the tester
> machine an IPv6 TCP SYN packet with an appropriate destination port to
> if1 interface without setting any extension header
>
> b\) Using the network traffic analyser, the tester verifies that the
> IP packet is received by the network product and the tester verifies
> that the corresponding ACK message is sent back.
>
> c\) Using the tool (e.g. Scapy) the tester sends an IPv6 TCP SYN
> packet with an appropriate destination port and an extension header
> set to the if1 interface
>
> d\) Using the network traffic analyser, the tester verifies that the
> IP packet is received by the network product but no ACK message is
> sent back. This confirms the packet is dropped as expected from the
> filtering rule.

**Expected Results:**

The network product discards IPv4 packets with unnecessary options or
IPv6 packets (assuming the network product supports IPv6) with extension
header.

**Expected format of evidence:**

A testing report provided by the testing agency which will consist of
the following information:

\- Used tools and their configurations

\- Settings and configurations used

\- Pcap trace

\- Screenshot

\- Test result (Passed or not)

##### 4.2.4.1.2 Authentication and Authorization

##### 4.2.4.1.2.1 Authenticated Privilege Escalation only {#authenticated-privilege-escalation-only .H6}

*Requirement Name*: There shall not be a privilege escalation method in
interactive sessions (CLI or GUI) which allows a user to gain
administrator/root privileges from another user account without
re-authentication.

*Requirement Description*:

There shall not be a privilege escalation method in interactive sessions
(CLI or GUI) which allows a user to gain administrator/root privileges
from another user account without re-authentication.. Implementation
example: Disable insecure privilege escalation methods so that users are
required to (re-)login directly into the account with the required
permissions.

*Test Case*:

**Test Name**: TC\_OS\_PRIVILEGE

**Purpose:**

To ensure that privileged operating system functions shall not be used
without successful authentication and authorization, and that violations
of this requirement are documented and strictly limited in number and
functionality.

**Procedure and execution steps:**

**Pre-Conditions:**

1\. The manufacturer shall provide documentation of the operating
system(s) used in the network product.

2\. The manufacturer shall supply a list \"A\" of operating system
functions which a system user can use to explicitly gain higher
privileges, and how these functions are configured. UnixÂ® example: sudo
command and its configuration file /etc/sudoers.

3\. The manufacturer shall supply a list \"B\" of operating system
commands, GUI functions, and files which will execute specifically
limited tasks automatically with higher privileges, even when used by a
low-privileged user. List \"B\" shall also contain:

\- configuration of these commands and GUI functions;

\- owner and permission settings of files;

\- justification for having the command, GUI function or file on the
network product\
UnixÂ® example: root-owned files with SUID and SGID permissions.

**Execution Steps**

The accredited evaluator\'s test lab is required to execute the
following steps:

1\. The tester logs into the network product and verifies that list
\"A\" is accurate, based on his expert knowledge of the operating
system(s) used in the network product, and operating system
documentation.

2\. The tester verifies that entries in the list \"A\" require
successful authentication for all users without exception, on basis of
the user name and at least one authentication attribute.

3\. The tester logs into the network product and verifies that list
\"B\" is accurate, based on his expert knowledge of the operating
system(s) used in the network product, and operating system
documentation. UnixÂ® example: To list files with SUID and SGID
permissions, the following commands can be used:

> SUID: find / -perm -4000 -type f -exec ls {} \\; \> suid\_files.txt
>
> SGID: find / -perm -2000 -type f -exec ls {} \\; \> sgid\_files.txt

4\. The tester verifies that file entries in the list \"B\" do not have
write permissions for anyone else than the owner.

5\. The tester verifies that entries in the list \"B\" only allow
execution of specifically limited tasks which are needed on this network
product, based on his expert knowledge of the operating system(s) used
in the network product, and operating system documentation.

6\. The tester logs into the network product and tests for every entry
in the list \"B\" that it does not provide a means to execute arbitrary
functions with administrator/root privileges, e.g. via a shell escape.

**Expected Results:**

1\. The network product does not allow a user to gain administrator/root
privileges from another user account without re-authentication.

2\. If a network product provides functions and files which execute
specifically limited tasks automatically with higher privileges, it
ensures that these limits cannot be bypassed.

3\. The system documentation about means for a user to gain
administrator/root privileges from another user account accurately
describes the network product.

**Expected format of evidence:**

A test report provided by the accredited evaluator\'s test lab which
will consist of the following information:

\- Documentation provided by the vendor: lists \"A\" and \"B\"

\- Description of executed tests and commands

\- Relevant output (e.g. screenshot or terminal log)

\- Test result (passed or not passed)

information.

#### 4.2.5.3 HTTP User sessions

*Requirement Name*: User sessions

*Requirement Description*:

To protect user sessions the Network Product shall support the following
session ID and session cookie requirements:

1\. The session ID shall uniquely identify the user and distinguish the
session from all other active sessions.

2\. The session ID shall be unpredictable.

3\. The session ID shall not contain sensitive information in clear text
(e.g. account number, social security, etc.).

4\. In addition to the Session Idle Timeout (see clause 4.2.3.5.2
Protecting sessions -- Inactivity timeout), the Network Product shall
automatically terminate sessions after a configurable maximum lifetime
This maximum lifetime defines the maximum session span. When the maximum
lifetime expires, the session shall be closed, the session ID shall be
deleted and the user shall be forced to (re)authenticate in the web
application and to establish a new session. The default value for this
maximum lifetime shall be set to 8 hours.

5\. Session ID\'s shall be regenerated for each new session (e.g. each
time a user logs in).

6\. The session ID shall not be reused or renewed in subsequent
sessions.

7\. The Network Product shall not use persistent cookies to manage
sessions but only session cookies. This means that neither the
\"expire\" nor the \"max-age\" attribute shall be set in the cookies.

8\. Where session cookies are used the attribute \'HttpOnly\' shall be
set to true.

9\. Where session cookies are used the \'domain\' attribute shall be set
to ensure that the cookie can only be sent to the specified domain.

10\. Where session cookies are used the \'path\' attribute shall be set
to ensure that the cookie can only be sent to the specified directory or
sub-directory.

11\. The Network Product shall not accept session identifiers from
GET/POST variables.

12\. The Network Product shall be configured to only accept server
generated session ID\'s.

*Security Objective references*: tba.

*Test case*:

**Purpose:**

Verify that the above 12 session ID and session cookie requirements have
been met.

**Procedure and execution steps:**

**Pre-Conditions:**

\- The Network Product uses a session ID that is communicated between
the client and Network Product to establish and maintain a session.

\- Documentation describing how a session is maintained and where the
session ID is stored / and how this is communicated and after how long
sessions expire.

\- The documentation should describe the algorithm used to generate the
session IDs.

**Execution Steps**

1\. The tester logs in repeatedly with different user IDs and a number
of times with the same user ID in a row and collects the session IDs
according to the documentation and the user IDs associated with them.
The tester verifies that:

a\. The session IDs are different between sessions of the same and
different users;

b\. The session IDs seems random based on his/her own experience. The
tester may use tests like the bitstream test or the count-the-1s-tests
from the diehard test suite. The tester documents how randomness was
verified;

c\. The session IDs are always different between sessions, also when the
user ID is the same.

2\. The tester verifies that when session cookies are used

a\. neither the \"expire\" or the \"max-age\" is set;

b\. the \'HttpOnly\' is set to true;

c\. the \'domain\' attribute is set to the correct domain;

d\. the \'path\' attribute is set to the correct directory or
sub-directory.

3\. The tester verifies that it is impossible to:

a\. access a session by retrieving the session ID and communicating the
session ID through a POST or GET variable.

b\. generate a session ID on the client by attempting to login with a
custom generated session ID.

c\. keep a session alive for longer than the configured maximum lifetime
(by default 8 hours).

**Expected Results:**

1\. A list of session IDs and user IDs that are different between
sessions even when the tester has logged in with the same user and that
are unpredictable as is confirmed by the entropy calculation.

2\. A confirmation from the tester that the correct variables are indeed
set.

3\. A denied access to the tester when attempting the two login steps of
step 3 and an expired session in step 3c.

**Expected format of evidence:**

A confirmation that the tester has confirmed that:

1\. Session IDs follow the rules 1-3, 5, 6.

2\. A session times out after 8 hours or sooner according to the
documentation.

3\. The correct cookie settings are used.

4\. The network product does not accept customly generated session IDs
and that session IDs over GET or POST are ignored.

#### 4.2.5.4 HTTP input validation

*Requirement Name*: Input validation

*Requirement Description*:

The Network Product shall have a mechanism in place to ensure that web
application inputs are not vulnerable to command injection or cross-site
scripting attacks. The Network Product shall validate, filter, escape,
and encode user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is
used as a web page that is served to other users.

*Security Objective references*: tba.

*Test case*:

This requirement is covered by the basic vulnerability testing as
described in clause 4.4.

### 4.2.6 Network Devices

#### 4.2.6.1 Protection of Data and Information

Refer to clause 4.2.3.2 for requirements on protection of data and
information.

#### 4.2.6.2 Protecting availability and integrity

##### 4.2.6.2.1 Packet filtering

*Requirement Name:* Packet filtering

*Requirement Description*:

The Network Product shall provide a mechanism to filter incoming IP
packets on any IP interface (see RFC 3871 for further information).

In particular the Network Product shall provide a mechanism:

1\) To filter incoming IP packets on any IP interface at Network Layer
.and Transport Layer of the stack ISO/OSI.

2\) To allow specified actions to be taken when a filter rule matches.
In particular at least the following actions should be supported:

\- Discard/Drop: the matching message is discarded, no subsequent rules
are applied and no answer is sent back.

\- Accept: the matching message is accepted.

\- Account: the matching message is accounted for i.e. a counter for the
rule is incremented. This action can be combined with the previous ones.
This feature is useful to monitor traffic before its blocking.

3\) To enable/disable for each rule the logging for Dropped packets,
i.e. details on messages matching the rule for troubleshooting.

4\) To filter on the basis of the value(s) of any portion of the
protocol header.

5\) To reset the accounting.

6\) The Network Product shall provide a mechanism to disable/enable each
defined rule.

*Security Objective references*: PROTECTED COMMUNICATIONS, HARDENING.

*Test case*:

**Test Name**: TC\_PACKET\_FILTERING

**Purpose:**

Verify that the system provides functionality for incoming packet
filtering

**Procedure and execution steps:**

**Pre-Conditions:**

\- The Network Product has packet filtering enabled.

\- The Network Product has 2 different logical or physical Ethernet
ports and each port is connected to a host**.**

**Execution Steps**

1\. The tester configures the Network Product to only allow ICMP traffic
from host 1.

2\. The tester initiates ping traffic from host 1.

3\. The tester initiates ping traffic from host 2.

**Expected Results:**

Host 1 will receive a \'ping\' answer back, but host 2 will not.

**Expected format of evidence:**

NA

##### 4.2.6.2.2 Interface robustness requirements

*Requirement Name*: Manipulated packets that are sent to an address of
the network device shall not lead to an impairment of availability.

*Requirement Description*:

A network device shall be not affected in its availability or robustness
by incoming packets, from other network element, that are manipulated or
differing the norm. This means that appropriate packets shall be
detected as invalid and be discarded. The process shall not be affecting
the performance of the network device. This robustness shall be just as
effective for a great mass of invalid packets as for individual or a
small number of packets.

Examples of such packets are:

\- Mass-produced TCP packets with a set SYN flag to produce half-open
TCP connections (SYN flooding attack).

\- Packets with the same IP sender address and IP recipient address
(Land attack).

\- Mass-produced ICMP packets with the broadcast address of a network as
target address (Smurf attack).

\- Fragmented IP packets with overlapping offset fields (Teardrop
attack).

---------------------------------------------------------------------

### 4.3.1 Introduction

The requirements proposed hereafter (with the relative test cases) aim
to securing network products (including the network functions in
service-based architecture) by reducing its surface of vulnerability. In
particular the identified requirements aim to ensure that all the
default network product configurations (including operating system
software, firmware and applications) are appropriately set.

### 4.3.2 Technical Baseline

#### 4.3.2.1 No unnecessary or insecure services / protocols

*Requirement Name*: No unnecessary or insecure services / protocols

*Requirement Description*:

The network product shall only run protocol handlers and services which
are needed for its operation, and which do not have any known security
vulnerabilities. In particular, by default the following services shall
be initially configured to be disabled on the network product by the
vendor except if services are needed during deployment. In that case
those services shall be disabled according to vendor's instructions
after deployment is done. Disabled protocols may still need to be
enabled for other reasons by the operators, e.g. remote diagnostics.

\- FTP

\- TFTP

\- Telnet

\- rlogin, RCP, RSH

\- HTTP

\- SNMPv1 and v2

\- SSHv1

\- TCP/UDP Small Servers (Echo, Chargen, Discard and Daytime)

\- Finger

\- BOOTP server

\- Discovery protocols (CDP, LLDP)

\- IP Identification Service (Identd)

\- PAD

\- MOP

NOTE 1: As an alternative to disabling the HTTP service, it is also
possible for this service to remain active for reasons of user
friendliness. In this case, however, queries to the web service may not
be answered directly on this port but from a redirected to HTTPS
service.

Note 2: Full documentation of required protocols and services of the
network product and their purpose needs to be provided by the vendor as
prerequisite for the test case.

restricted to interfaces in the management network to support separation
of management traffic from user traffic.

*Test Case*:

**Test Name***:* TC\_RESTRICTED\_REACHIBILITY\_OF\_SERVICES

**Purpose:**

To verify that it is possible to bind the services only to the
interfaces from which they are expected to be reachable.

To verify that the network product provides anti-spoofing function that
is, before a packet is processed, the network product checks whether the
source IP of the received packet is reachable through the interface it
comes in.

To verify that if the received packet source address is not routable
through the interface on which it comes, then the network product drops
this packet.

**Procedure and execution steps:**

> **Pre-Conditions:**

\- A node N1 is available with:

> \- Two interfaces named respectively if1-n1 connected to the network
> product and if2-n1 to which the tester connects a tester machine
>
> \- routing capabilities
>
> \- if2-n1 has a static IP address (e.g. 192.168.3.1 belonging to the
> subnet 192.168.3.0/24)

\- A node N2 is available with:

> \- Two interfaces named respectively if1-n2 connected to the network
> product and if2-n2 to which the tester connects a tester machine
>
> \- Routing capabilities. In particular N2 has a default route to
> if1-np subnet via if2-np (e.g. 192.168.2.1)
>
> \- if2-n2 has a static IP address . This ip is the same as if2-n1
> (e.g. 192.168.3.1 belonging to the subnet 192.168.3.0/24)

\- The network product has at least 2 enabled interfaces said if1-np and
if2-np:

\- The interface if1-np is connected to interface if1-n1 of the node N1
on the subnet, e.g., 192.168.1.0/24.

> \- The interface if2-np is connected to interface if1-n2 of the node
> N2 on the subnet, e.g., 192.168.2.0/24.
>
> \- The network product is configured with a static route for the
> subnet where if2-n1 is connected to (e.g. 192.168.3.0/24), so this
> subnet can be reached via if1-n1 through if1-np.

Figure 1: Configurations for the network product, N1 and N2

\- The vendor shall declare, in the documentation accompanying the
network product, the supported anti-spoofing mechanism (e.g. RPF or
similar function) and if it is enabled for all interfaces (e.g.
net.ipv4.conf.all.rp\_filter = 1 and net.ipv4.conf.default.rp\_filter =
1 in the linux sysctl.conf file) or per interface bases.

\- The vendor shall declare if the dropped packets can be logged and how
to enable this logging

\- The tester has administrator privileges

\- A tester machine is available and configured with:

\- A static IP address belonging to the subnet where if2-n1 and if2-n2
are connected to (e.g. 192.168.3.2/24)

> \- A default gateway set to if2-n1 and if2-n2 IP Address (e.g.
> 192.168.3.1)

\- A network traffic analyser (e.g. tcpdump) on the network product is
available

> **Execution Steps**

1\. The tester starts to send ping messages to if1-np interface of the
network product.

2\. The tester verifies, through the network traffic analyser, that the
ping reaches correctly the if1-np interface and that responses are sent
back.

3\. The tester disconnects the tester machine from if2-n1 interface of
the node N1 and reconnects it to the interface if2-n2 of the node N2:

> \- The testers uses the same network configuration of the tester
> machine.
>
> \- The tester sends ping messages to if1-np interface of the network
> product.
>
> \- The tester verifies, through the network traffic analyser, that the
> pings reach the if1-np interface of the network product, but they are
> dropped and no response is sent back since the source of the received
> packet is not reachable through the interface it came in.
>
> \- The tester sends ping messages to if2-np interface of the network
> product.
>
> \- The tester verifies, through the network traffic analyser, that the
> pings reach the if2-np interface of the network product, but they are
> dropped and no response is sent back since there is a default route
> via if2-np.
>
> \- If the dropped packets are logged, the testers verifies that these
> packets are recorded.

**Expected Results:**

The network product supports an anti-spoofing mechanism (e.g. the RPF
function) and it accepts a packet only if it reaches the network product
on the expected interface (i.e. this packet has a source ip address
belonging to the same network as the interface where it came in or if it
is routable through the interface on which it came in), otherwise it
discards the packet.

**Expected format of evidence:**

A testing report provided by the testing agency which will consist of
the following information:

\- The user settings and configurations

\- Pcap files

\- Log file if available

\- Test result (Passed or not)

##### 4.3.3.1.2 Minimized kernel network functions

*Requirement Name*: Minimized kernel network functions.

*Requirement Description*:

Kernel based network functions not needed for the operation of the
network element shall be deactivated.

In particular the following ones shall be disabled by default:

Note: Void

\- Proxy ARP (to prevent resource exhaustion attack and
man-in-the-middle attacks.

\- Directed broadcast (to prevent Smurf, Denial of Service attack and
others like it*.*

\- IPv4 Multicast handling. In particular all packets with IP source or
destination address belonging to the multicast IP ranges (224.0.0.0
through 239.255.255.255) shall be discarded by default and multicast
route caching and forwarding shall be disabled to prevent smurf and
fraggle attacks. A configuration option shall be available to enable the
IPv4 multicast handling if required.

\- Gratuitous ARP messages (to prevent ARP Cache Poisoning attacks
\[ef\]). A Gratuitous ARP request can be used mainly to inform the
neighbours about the change in the MAC for the specified IP and
consequently to update their ARP tables or to update the switches with
the new MAC address or to defend link-local IP addresses in the Zeroconf
protocol. By default, the network product shall not send Unsolicited ARP
and any incoming Gratuitous ARP requests shall be discarded.

Note: The above text does not preclude that Gratuitous ARP can be
enabled in certain deployment scenarios.

Answering routine for broadcast ICMP packets. In particular all ICMP
ECHO and TIMESTAMP requests sent to network product via
broadcast/multicast shall not be answered by default.

*Test Case*:

**Test Name**: TC\_PROXY\_ARP\_DISABLING

**Purpose:**

Verify that the Proxy ARP feature is disabled by default on the network
product. In particular this test case verifies that the network product
does not respond to ARP requests intended for another host.

**Procedure and execution steps:**

> **Pre-Conditions:**

\- The network product shall have at least 2 different physical or
logical Ethernet interface IF1 and IF2. E.g.

> \- Host 1 is connected to IF1 on subnet A (for example
> 172.16.10.0/16).
>
> \- Host 2 is connected to IF2 on subnet B (for example
> 172.16.20.0/24).

\- Network traffic analyser on the network product (e.g. TCPDUMP) or an
external traffic analyser directly connected to the network product is
available.

> **Execution Steps**

1\. If the feature is available in a configuration file, verify that it
is disabled by default.

2\. Broadcast an ARP request from Host 1 on Subnet A to discover the MAC
of Host 2 on subnet B. Since the ARP request is a broadcast, it reaches
all nodes in the Subnet A, which include the IF1 interface of the
network product, but it does not reach Host 2.

3\. Verify that the network product correctly receives this packet but
that it does not send an ARP reply to Host 1 with its own MAC address.

**Expected Results:**

No Arp Reply is received by Host 1.

**Expected format of evidence:**

Pcap trace, snapshot of ARP Cache of Host 1

**Test Name**: TC\_DIRECTED\_BROAD\_DISABLING

**Purpose:**

Verify that the Directed broadcast is disabled by default on the network
product. In particular this test case verifies that a packet received by
a network product whose destination address is a valid broadcast address
is dropped.

**Procedure and execution steps:**

> **Pre-Conditions:**

\- The network product has at least 2 different physical or logical
Ethernet interface IF1 and IF2.

\- Host 1 is connected to IF1 on Subnet A and Host 2 is connected to IF2
on Subnet B.

\- Network traffic analyser on the network product (e.g. TCPDUMP) or an
external traffic analyser directly connected to the network product is
available.

> **Execution Steps**

1\. If the feature is available in a configuration file, verify that it
is disabled by default.

2\. Send an IP packet from Host 1 whose IP destination address is a
valid broadcast address belonging to the subnet B.

3\. Verify that the Host 2 on Subnet B does not receive the packet
because it will be dropped by the network product, rather than being
broadcasted.

**Expected Results:**

The packet is not broadcasted by the network product and Host 2 cannot
receive it.

**Expected format of evidence:**

Pcap trace showing that packet from host 1only incomes to the network
product.

**Test Name:** TC\_ IP\_MULTICAST\_HANDLING

**Purpose:**

Verify that IP Multicast is disabled by default on the network product.
In particular this test case verifies that packets with IP source or
destination address belonging to the multicast IP ranges (224.0.0.0
through 239.255.255.255) are not handled by the network product.

**Procedure and execution steps:**

> **Pre-Conditions:**

\- Network traffic analyser on the network product or an external
traffic analyser directly connected to the network product is available.

external traffic analyser directly connected to the network product is
available.

\- Host 1 is connected to the network product

\- The network product ARP Cache already contains an entry for Host 1

\- The network product documentation does not state any reason why
gratuitous ARP may be deliberately enabled in order to satisfy certain
deployment scenarios. If the network product documentation does,
however, state that the usage of gratuitous ARP is enabled in certain
deployment scenarios, then this test case is not applicable (refer to
the NOTE in the requirement).

> **Execution Steps**

1\. If the feature is available in a configuration file, verify that it
is disabled by default.

2\. Send a Gratuitous ARP request from Host 1, i.e. an ARP *request*
where the source and destination IP are both set to an IP address
different from the one already cached in the network product ARP Cache
for Host 1 and the destination MAC is the broadcast address
ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff.

### 4.3.6 Network Functions in service-based architecture

#### 4.3.6.1 Introduction

The purpose of the sub-clauses in 4.3.6 is to identify and describe the
hardening related requirements for all Network Function (NF) within the
5G Core (5GC) utilizing Service-Based Interfaces (SBI) and the
corresponding test cases.

#### 4.3.6.2 No code execution or inclusion of external resources by JSON parsers

*Requirement Name*: No code execution or inclusion of external resources
by JSON parsers.

*Requirement Description*:

Parsers used by Network Functions (NF) shall not execute JavaScript or
any other code contained in JSON objects received on Service Based
Interfaces (SBI). Further, these parsers shall not include any resources
external to the received JSON object itself, such as files from the NF's
filesystem or other resources loaded externally.

*Threat References*: TR 33.926 \[4\], clause 6.3.2.1, JSON Parser
Exploits

*Test Case*:

**Test Name:** TC\_JSON\_PARSER\_CODE\_EXEC\_INCL

**Purpose:**

NFs implementing SBI transfer application data serialized as JSON
objects. When receiving such data, an NF parses this JSON representation
and creates equivalent internal data structures. Since the contents of
the JSON objects must be considered untrusted, blindly executing code
fragments or loading resources from a local path or Uniform Resource
Identifier (URI) must not be possible.

**Procedure and execution steps:**

> **Pre-Conditions:**

\- The tester has the privileges to log in the network product and to
access to the all system resources (e.g. log files)

\- A list of all available network services containing at least the
following information shall be included in the documentation
accompanying the Network Product:

\- all interfaces providing IP-based protocols;

\- the available transport layer protocols on these interfaces;

\- their open ports and associated services in the form of an OpenAPI3.0
interface specification;

\- The tester should have access to an effective Web Application
Security (WAS) test tool that allows to generate HTTP messages
exploiting JSON parsers that do not prevent the above-mentioned
scenarios of code execution and loading external resources. The
accredited test lab is expected to have sufficient expertise to
recognize the level of effectiveness of the available tools.

\- A network traffic analyser on the network product (e.g. TCPDUMP) or
an external traffic analyser directly connected to the network product
and on a tester machine is available.

> **Execution Steps**

1\. Execution of available WAS test tools against the network product's
API endpoints via its Service Based Interfaces.

2\. Using a network traffic analyser on the network product, e.g.
TCPDUMP or an external traffic analyser directly connected to the
network product, the tester verifies that no external resources get
loaded during JSON parsing.

3\. Depending on the actual JavaScript code in the HTTP message, the
tester verifies that the network product does not execute any of the
contained actions.

**Expected Results:**

\- The NF does not load any resources external to the JSON object
itself.

\- The NF does not execute any JavaScript code contained in JSON
objects.

**Expected format of evidence:**

A testing report provided by the testing agency which will consist of
the following information:

\- The used tool(s) name and version information

\- Settings and configurations used

\- The output log file of the chosen tool that displays the results
(passed/failed).

\- Screenshot

\- Test result (Passed or not)

4.4 Basic vulnerability testing requirements
--------------------------------------------

### 4.4.1 Introduction

Basic Vulnerability Testing activities consist of requirements for
running automated Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) and Commercial
off-the-shelf (COTS) security testing tools against the external
interfaces of a Network Product. These activities cover at least four
aspects: Port Scanning, Vulnerability Scanner by the use of
Vulnerability scanners and robustness/fuzz testing, and endpoint
scanning. For each of these aspects, test requirements and test results
are described in the present clause.

NOTE: The individual tools used for Basic Vulnerability Testing are
selected by the evaluator. The SECAM accreditation body will ensure
during accreditation of the evaluator\'s laboratory that the testers are
able to utilize adequate tools.

### 4.4.2 Port Scanning

*Requirement Name*: Port scaning

*Requirement Description*:

It shall be ensured that on all network interfaces, only documented
ports on the transport layer respond to requests from outside the
system.

The test for this requirement can be carried out using a suitable tool
or manually performed as described below. If a tool is used then the
tester needs to provide evidence, e.g. by referring to the documentation
of the tool, that the tool actually provides functionality equivalent to
the steps described below.

*Test Case*:

**Test Name**: TC\_BVT\_PORT\_SCANNING

**Purpose:**

To ensured that on all network interfaces, only documented ports on the
transport layer respond to requests from outside the system

**Procedure and execution steps:**

**Pre-Conditions:**

A list of all available network services containing at least the
following information shall be included in the documentation
accompanying the Network Product:

1\. all interfaces providing IP-based protocols;

2\. the available transport layer protocols on these interfaces;

3\. their open ports and associated services per transport layer
protocol;

4\. and a free-form description of their purposes.

The port scanning tool that is used shall be capable to detect open
ports on the relevant transport layer protocols.

NOTE: It might not be possible for certain transport layer protocols
(like UDP) to unambiguously detect whether a port is open or not by
means of external port scanning. Also in some circumstances it might not
be efficient to do external port scanning, e.g. if there are security
measures to limit the rate a system can be probed. In those cases the
accredited evaluator\'s test laboratory determines another means
suitable to verify which ports are open.

**Execution Steps**

The accredited evaluator\'s test lab is required to execute the
following steps:

1\. Verification of the compliance to the prerequisites:

a\. Verification that the list of available network services is
available in the documentation of the Network Product

b\. Validation that all entries in the list of services are meaningful
and reasonably necessary for the operation of the Network Product class

2\. Identification of the open ports by means of capable port scanning
tools or other suitable testing means

3\. Verification that the list of identified open ports matches the list
of available network services in the documentation of the Network
Product

**Expected Results:**

The used tool(s) name, their unambiguous version (also for plug-ins if
applicable), used settings, and the relevant output containing all the
technically relevant information about test results is evidence and
shall be part of the testing documentation.

All discrepancies between the list of identified open ports and the list
of available network services in the documentation shall be highlighted
in the testing documentation.

**Expected format of evidence:**

Output of portscan and list of identified discrepancies.

### 4.4.3 Vulnerability scanning

*Requirement Name:* Vulnerability scanning

*Requirement Description*:

The purpose of vulnerability scanning is to ensure that there are no
known vulnerabilities (or that relevant vulnerabilities are identified
and remediation plans in place to mitigate them) on the Network Product,
both in the OS and in the applications installed, that can be detected
by means of automatic testing tools via the Internet Protocol enabled
network interfaces.

Vulnerability scanning tools may also report false positives and they
shall be investigated and documented in the test report.

The test for this requirement can be carried out using a suitable tool
or manually performed as described below. If a tool is used then the
tester needs to provide evidence, e.g. by referring to the documentation
of the tool, that the tool actually provides functionality equivalent to
the steps described below.

*Test case*:

**Test Name**: TC\_BVT\_VULNERABILITY\_SCANNING

**Purpose:**

The purpose of vulnerability scanning is to ensure that there are no
known vulnerabilities (or that relevant vulnerabilities are identified
and remediation plans in place to mitigate them) on the Network Product
that can be detected by means of automatic testing tools via the
Internet Protocol enabled network interfaces.

**Procedure and execution steps:**

**Pre-Conditions:**

A list of all available network services containing at least the
following information shall be included in the documentation
accompanying the Network Product:

\- all interfaces providing IP-based protocols;

\- the available transport layer protocols on these interfaces;

\- their open ports and associated services;

\- and a free-form description of their purposes.

NOTE 1: This list is to be validated as part of the BVT port scanning
activity.

The used vulnerability scanning tool shall be capable to detect known
vulnerabilities on common services. The used vulnerability information
shall be reasonably recent at the time of testing.

**Execution Steps**

The accredited evaluator\'s test lab is required to execute the
following steps:

1\. Execution of the suitable vulnerability scanning tool against all
interfaces providing IP-based protocols of the Network Product.

2\. Evaluation of the results based on their severity.

**Expected Results:**

The used tool(s) name, their unambiguous version (also for plug-ins if
applicable), used settings, and the relevant output is evidence and
shall be part of the testing documentation.

The discovered vulnerabilities (including source, example CVE ID),
together with a rating of their severity, shall be highlighted in the
testing documentation.

COTS Vulnerability scanners, by their nature, (e.g. depending on how
they are configured) may result in false findings/positives. The tool's
documentation may even mention that the failing test shall be repeated
to check whether it is really a recurring problem or not. The tester
shall make best effort to determine if there is an issue with NE or the
test tool and if necessary, work with the vendor of the network product
to come to a consensus on the test result outcome.

NOTE 2: This testing documentation is input to the vulnerability
mitigation process (that may include patching). This is part of the
product lifecycle management process developed by GSMA SECAG.

**Expected format of evidence:**

Output of BVT tool.

### 4.4.4 Robustness and fuzz testing 

*Requirement Name:* Robustness and fuzz testing

*Requirement Reference:* 4.2.6.2.2. -- Interface Robustness requirements

*Requirement Description*:

It shall be ensured that externally reachable services are reasonably
robust when receiving unexpected input

*Test case*:

**Test Name**: TC\_BVT\_ROBUSTNESS AND FUZZ TESTING

**Purpose:**

To verify that the network product provides externally reachable
services which are robust against unexpected input. The target of this
test are the protocol stacks (e.g. diameter stack) rather than the
applications (e.g. web app).

**Procedure and execution steps:**

**Pre-Conditions:**

\- The tester has the privileges to log in the network product and to
access all system resources (e.g. log files)

\- A list of all available network services containing at least the
following information shall be included in the documentation
accompanying the Network Product:

\- all interfaces providing IP-based protocols;

\- the available transport layer protocols on these interfaces;

\- their open ports and associated services;

\- and a free-form description of their purposes.

NOTE: This list is to be validated as part of the BVT port scanning
activity.

\- The robustness and fuzzing tools that are selected for this test
shall utilize state-of-the-art technology to identify input which causes
the Network Product to behave in an unspecified, undocumented, or
unexpected manner.

\- Fuzz testing tools are a highly sophisticated technology and
adaptation to the individual protocols in question is needed to be
effective. Therefore, there is a lack of available effective fuzz
testing tools available especially for protocols proprietary to the
Telco industry. Taking into account note 4 of TR 33.916\'s clause 7.2.4,
test labs shall acquire fuzz testing tools for those protocols where
commercially feasible.

\- It needs to be taken into account that fuzz testing tools might show
drastic differences in terms of effectiveness. The accredited test lab
is expected to have sufficient expertise to recognize the level of
effectiveness of the available tools.

\- A network traffic analyser on the network product (e.g. TCPDUMP) or
an external traffic analyser directly connected to the network product
and on a tester machine is available.

**Execution Steps**

The accredited evaluator\'s test lab is required to execute the
following steps:

1\. Execution of available effective fuzzing tools against the protocols
available via interfaces providing IP-based protocols of the Network
Product for an amount of time sufficient to be effective.

2\. Execution of available effective robustness test tools against the
protocols available via interfaces providing IP-based protocols of the
Network Product for an amount of time sufficient to be effective.

3\. For both step 1 and 2:

a\. Using a network traffic analyser on the network product (e.g.
TCPDUMP) or an external traffic analyser directly connected to the
network product, the tester verifies that the packets are correctly
processed by the network product.

b\. The testers verifies that the network product and any running
network service does not crash.

c\. The execution of tests shall run sufficient times.

**Expected Results:**

A list of all of the protocols of the network product reachable
externally on an IP-based interface, together with an indication whether
effective available robustness and fuzz testing tools have been used
against them, shall be part of the testing documentation. If no tool can
be acquired for a protocol, a free form statement should explain why
not.

The used tool(s) name, their unambiguous version (also for plug-ins if
applicable), used settings, and the relevant output is evidence and
shall be part of the testing documentation.

Any input causing unspecified, undocumented, or unexpected behaviour,
and a description of this behaviour shall be highlighted in the testing
documentation.

COTS fuzzing tools, by their nature, may have an acceptable failure rate
(e.g. 0.1%) due to different non-deterministic variables in their
implementation. At some point the tool's documentation may even mention
that the failing test shall be repeated to check whether it is really a
recurring problem or not. The tester shall make best effort to determine
if there is an issue with NE or the test tool and if necessary, work
with the vendor of the network product to come to a consensus on the
test result outcome.

**Expected format of evidence:**

A testing report provided by the testing agency which will consist of
the following information:

\- The used tool(s) name and version information,

\- Settings and configurations used

\- The output log file of the chosen tool that displays the results
(passed/failed).

\- Screenshot

\- Test result (Passed or not)

\- Log/evidence tracing possible crashes

\- Any input causing unspecified, undocumented, or unexpected behaviour
