In the present document, modal verbs have the following meanings:

**shall** indicates a mandatory requirement to do something

**shall not** indicates an interdiction (prohibition) to do something

The constructions \"shall\" and \"shall not\" are confined to the
context of normative provisions, and do not appear in Technical Reports.

The constructions \"must\" and \"must not\" are not used as substitutes
for \"shall\" and \"shall not\". Their use is avoided insofar as
possible, and they are not used in a normative context except in a
direct citation from an external, referenced, non-3GPP document, or so
as to maintain continuity of style when extending or modifying the
provisions of such a referenced document.

**should** indicates a recommendation to do something

**should not** indicates a recommendation not to do something

**may** indicates permission to do something

**need not** indicates permission not to do something

The construction \"may not\" is ambiguous and is not used in normative
elements. The unambiguous constructions \"might not\" or \"shall not\"
are used instead, depending upon the meaning intended.

**cannot** indicates that something is impossible

The constructions \"can\" and \"cannot\" are not substitutes for \"may\"
and \"need not\".

**will** indicates that something is certain or expected to happen as a
result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside
the scope of the present document

**will not** indicates that something is certain or expected not to
happen as a result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which
is outside the scope of the present document

4 Overview of advanced V2X security architecture 
================================================

4.1 General
-----------

The V2X architecture is described in TS 23.287 \[2\] which describes V2X
communication over both the Uu reference point supported by E-UTRA
connected to 5GC and/or NR connected to 5GC and PC5 reference point
supported by E-UTRA and/or NR. The NR based PC5 reference point supports
unicast, groupcast and broadcast modes (see TS 23.287 \[2\]).

The security for PC5 reference point supported by E-UTRA is given in
TS 33.185 \[5\]. The security for the other cases is given in the
present document.

5 Security for V2X over NR based PC5 reference point
====================================================

5.1 General
-----------

This clause contains the security and privacy requirements and specifies
procedures that can achieve the requirements for V2X over NR based PC5
reference point except those for PC5 over E-UTRA which are given in TS
33.185 \[5\].

5.2 Common security 
-------------------

### 5.2.1 General

This clause describes the security requirements and the procedures that
are commonly applied for the all kinds of communication modes, i.e.
unicast mode, groupcast mode and broadcast mode, which the NR based PC5
reference point supports.

### 5.2.2 Requirements

#### 5.2.2.1 Requirements for Cross-RAT control authorization indication

The 5G System shall provide means to manage the cross-RAT PC5 control
authorization.

### 5.2.3 Procedures

#### 5.2.3.1 Cross-RAT PC5 control authorization indication

The procedures for the cross-RAT PC5 control authorization indication
are specified in TS 23.287 \[2\] clause 6.5.

5.3 Security for unicast mode
-----------------------------

### 5.3.1 General

This clause describes the security requirements and the procedures that
can be specifically applied for the NR based PC5 unicast mode.

### 5.3.2 Requirements

#### 5.3.2.1 Requirements for securing the PC5 unicast link 

The initiating UE shall establish a different security context for each
receiving UE during the PC5 unicast link establishment if the security
is activated.

PC5 unicast link security establishment between the initiating UE and
each receiving UE shall be protected from man-in-the-middle attacks.

The system shall support confidentiality protection, integrity
protection and replay protection of the user plane data of PC5 unicast.

The system shall support confidentiality protection, integrity
protection and replay protection of signalling for PC5 unicast link.

The system shall support means of configuring the signalling and user
plane security policies to UEs for a particular PC5 unicast link.

Signalling plane protection of the PC5 unicast link for a V2X service
shall align with the PC5 signalling security policies of the
communicating UEs.

User plane protection of the PC5 unicast link for a V2X service shall
align with the PC5 user plane security policies of the communicating
UEs.

#### 5.3.2.2 Identity privacy requirements for the PC5 unicast link 

The 5G System should provide means for mitigating trackability attacks
on a UE during PC5 unicast communications.

The 5G System should provide means for mitigating link ability attacks
on a UE during PC5 unicast communications.

NOTE: The 5G system provides means for mitigating trackability and link
ability if security of the connection is activated.

### 5.3.3 Procedures

#### 5.3.3.1 Securing the PC5 unicast link

##### 5.3.3.1.1 General

The NR based PC5 unicast communication procedures are described in TS
23.287 \[2\]. Clause 5.3.3.1 details how the security for this
communication is established and used.

##### 5.3.3.1.2 Overview 

##### 5.3.3.1.2.0 Security Context {#security-context .H6}

The UE establishes a security context for each unicast link. The
security context includes K~NRP-sess~, NRPEK (if applicable), NRPIK, the
chosen confidentiality (if applicable) and integrity algorithms, and
PDCP counters used with each bearer. The UE updates the security context
associated to the unicast link when the unicast link is rekeyed. The UE
deletes the security context associated to a unicast link once the
unicast link is released.

##### 5.3.3.1.2.1 Key hierarchy {#key-hierarchy .H6}

PC5 unicast link uses 4 different layers of keying material as shown in
figure 5.3.3.1.2.1-1.

Figure 5.3.3.1.2.1-1: Key Hierarchy for PC5 unicast link

The different layers of keys are the following:

\- Long term credentials: These are the credentials that are provisioned
into the UE(s) and form the root of the security of the PC5 unicast
link. The credentials may include symmetric key(s) or public/private key
pair depending on the particular use case. Authentication signalling
(see clause 5.3.3.1.3.2) is exchanged between the UEs to derive the
K~NRP~.

\- K~NRP~: This is a 256-bit root key that is shared between the two
entities that communicating using NR PC5 unicast link. It may be
refreshed by re-running the authentication signalling using the
long-term credentials. Nonces are exchanged between the UEs and used
with the K~NRP~ to generate a K~NRP-sess~ (the next layer of keys).
K~NRP~ may be kept even when the UEs have no active unicast
communication session between them. The 32-bit K~NRP~ ID is used to
identify K~NRP.~

\- K~NRP-sess~: This is the 256-bit key that is derived by UE from
K~NRP~ and is used derive keys that to protect the transfer of data
between the UEs. The K~NRP-sess~ is derived per unicast link. During
activated unicast communication session between the UEs, the K~NRP-sess~
may be refreshed by running the rekeying procedure. The actual keys (see
next bullet) that are used in the confidentiality and integrity
algorithms are derived directly from K~NRP-sess~. The 16-bit K~NRP-sess~
ID identifies the K~NRP-sess~.

NOTE 1: A K~NRP-sess~ ID with a zero value indicates that no security is
used and hence the UEs do not assign an all zero value of K~NRP-sess~ ID
when creating a security context.

\- NRPEK and NRPIK: The NR PC5 Encryption Key (NRPEK) and NR PC5
Integrity Key (NRPIK) are used in the chosen confidentiality and
integrity algorithms respectively for protecting PC5-S signalling, PC5
RRC signalling, and PC5 user plane data. They are derived from
K~NRP-sess~ and are refreshed automatically every time K~NRP-sess~ is
changed.

NOTE 2: Whether the above keys (i.e. K~NRP~, K~NRP-sess~, NRPEK and
NRPIK) are derived is based on the result of the security activation for
the signalling security.

NOTE 3: K~NRP~ is used to derive the keys for a security context for a
unicast link established between a pair of UEs and could be used to
derive keys for additional links established between a certain pair of
UEs. The K~NRP~ and its accompanying K~NRP~ ID values are not part of
the security context for a unicast link and do not have to be deleted
after unicast link release.

##### 5.3.3.1.2.2 Security states {#security-states .H6}

A UE may be in one of the three different security states with respect
to another UE as follows:

\- Provisioned-security: This is where a UE just has its own long term
keys.

\- Partial-security: This is where a UE has recently communicated with
another UE and still has the K~NRP~ that it used with the other UE, but
no other derived keys.

\- Full-security: This is where a UE is actually communicating with
another UE and has K~NRP~, and a security context per unicast link (see
clause 5.3.3.1.2.0). Within a security context, the NRPEK and the chosen
confidentiality algorithm may not exist if both signalling and user
plane confidentiality are inactivated.

Once a UE ends its unicast communication session with another UE in
Full-security state, it shall delete K~NRP-sess~, NRPEK, and NRPIK, the
choice of algorithms and the counters, and may also delete K~NRP~.

##### 5.3.3.1.2.3 High level flows for the security establishment {#high-level-flows-for-the-security-establishment .H6}

Figure 5.3.3.1.2.3-1 provides a high-level flow of a UE establishing a
connection with other UE(s).

Figure 5.3.3.1.2.3-1: High-level flow of connection establishment

The flow proceeds as follow:

1\. UE\_1 sends a Direct Communication Request. This message may be
received by multiple UEs.

2a/3a/4a. UE\_2a chooses to respond to the message and may initiate the
Direct Auth and Key Establishment procedure (if needed based clause
5.3.3.1.3) to generate the key K~NRP~. UE\_2a then runs the Direct
Security Mode Command procedure with UE\_1 to continue the connection
establishment procedures. If this is successful, UE\_2a sends the Direct
Communication Accept message.

2b. UE\_2b chooses not to respond the UE\_1

2c/3c/4c. UE\_2c responds to UE\_1 using the same sequence of messages
as UE\_2a.

When each responder decides to activate signalling integrity protection
and/or signalling confidentiality protection, each responder establishes
a different security context with UE\_1 that is not known to the other
UEs, i.e. the security context used between UE\_1 and UE\_2a is not
known to UE\_2b and UE\_2c.

The Direct Communication Request is always sent unprotected and only
contains enough information for a secure connection to be established
with the other UE. Any information UE\_1 needs to send to the other UEs
in order to establish the connection is included in the Direct Security
Mode Complete message (sent as part of the Direct Security Mode
procedure, see TS 23.287 \[2\]) from UE\_1 as this message is both
confidentiality and integrity protected under the condition of activated
non-NULL signalling confidentiality protection of the link.

##### 5.3.3.1.3 Key establishment procedures 

##### 5.3.3.1.3.1 General  {#general-5 .H6}

Clause 5.3.3.1.3 provides the details on the establishment of K~NRP~.
The key establishment procedures in clause 5.3.3.1.3.1 and 5.3.3.1.3.2
shall be skipped if the receiving UE decides to not activate the
signalling integrity protection of this PC5 unicast link. The long-term
credentials and associated authentication method that are used to
establish the keys used to protect the PC5 unicast link may either be
specified in 3GPP specification or be a method described outside of 3GPP
specifications. In the latter case, it is not practical for all cases to
specify the signalling in individual IEs on the NR PC5 interface for all
these applications, hence all the authentication is specified to be
carried in a generic container (called Key\_Est\_Info in the following
clause) on the NR PC5 interface. This allows, for example, an
application to change the authentication method without affecting the NR
PC5 interface.

##### 5.3.3.1.3.2 Key establishment {#key-establishment .H6}

At each step of the flow (and the possible multiple times that step 2
can be run), the Key\_Est\_Info contains the different data that is
required for key establishment. Such data is transparent to the PC5
layer, i.e. the PC5 layer does not need to understand the content of
Key\_Est\_info.

NOTE: The endpoint in the UEs that understands the contents of
Key\_Est\_Info may be an application on the UEs. Between the PC5 layer
and the application layer on the vehicles, the information contained in
Key\_Est\_Info can be passed in an implementation-specific manner, e.g.
as one block or several IEs.

Figure 5.3.3.1.3.2-1 shows the message flows for establishing security
at PC5 using the key established at the layer above PC5. The need for
both steps 2a and 2b (and the number of times both steps 2a and step 2b
are run) depends on the authentication method being used.

Figure 5.3.3.1.3.2-1: Message flow for the establishment of PC5 security
key using a generic container

The steps are as follows and apply to establishment of the initial key
or rekeying:

1\. In the case, UE\_1 determines it needs to establish a PC5 connection
with another UE, UE\_1 sends the Direct Communication Request message
and this message is received by UE\_2. In case of rekeying an existing
connection with UE\_2, UE\_1 shall send a Direct Rekeying Request
message to UE\_2 instead of Direct Communication Request. The Direct
Communication Request message shall include the Key\_Est\_Info unless
UE\_1\'s signalling integrity security policy is NOT NEEDED. In the
former case, the message may include Key\_Est\_Info. The Direct Rekeying
Request message shall include Key\_Est\_Info unless the Null integrity
algorithm is currently in use.

2\. This step is optional and may be run multiple times depending on the
authentication method used.

a\. UE\_2 shall send a Direct Auth and Key Establish message including
the Key\_Est\_Info to UE\_1.

b\. UE\_1 shall send respond with a Direct Auth and Key Establish
Response message including the Key\_Est\_Info to UE\_2.

3\. In case the UE\_2 decides to activate the signalling integrity
protection, UE\_2 shall calculate (if not already done) K~NRP~. UE\_2
shall send a Direct Security Mode Command messages to UE\_1. These
messages may include Key\_Est\_Info if need by the authentication method
being used and shall contain MSB of K~NRP~ ID unless the Null integrity
algorithm is selected by UE\_2. The MSB of K~NRP~ ID are chosen so that
they uniquely identify K~NRP~ at UE\_2.

4\. On receiving the Direct Security Mode Command, UE\_1 shall calculate
(if not already done) K~NRP~ based on Key\_Est\_Info (if provided).
UE\_1 shall execute the following procedures unless the Null integrity
algorithm is selected by UE\_2: UE\_1 shall choose the LSB of K~NRP~ ID
so that they uniquely identify K~NRP~ at UE\_1. UE\_1 shall form K~NRP~
ID from the received MSB of K~NRP~ ID and its chosen LSB of K~NRP~ ID
and shall store the complete K~NRP~ ID with K~NRP~.

UE\_1 shall send a Direct Security Mode Complete message to UE\_2 which
shall contain the LSB of K~NRP~ ID. UE\_2 shall form K~NRP~ ID from its
chosen MSB of K~NRP~ ID and the received LSB of K~NRP~ ID and shall
store the complete K~NRP~ ID with K~NRP~.

##### 5.3.3.1.4 Security establishment procedures 

##### 5.3.3.1.4.1 General  {#general-6 .H6}

Clause 5.3.3.1.4.2 describes the security policy and how the UEs handle
the policy. There are two different cases when an overall security
context may be established; to set up a new connection and to re-key an
ongoing connection. These cases are described in clauses 5.3.3.1.4.3 and
5.3.3.1.4.4 respectively. Clause 5.3.3.1.4.5 describes the establishment
of security for a user plane bearer.

##### 5.3.3.1.4.2 Security policy  {#security-policy .H6}

##### 5.3.3.1.4.2.1 General {#general-7 .H6}

The PC5 unicast link shall support activation or deactivation of
security based on the security policy similar to Uu, as defined in TS
33.501\[6\]. The security policy shall be provisioned for PC5 unicast
link as well, as detailed in clause 5.3.3.1.4.2.2 of the present
document and handled as detailed in clause 5.3.3.1.4.2.3 of the present
document.

##### 5.3.3.1.4.2.2 Procedure for security policy provisioning for PC5 unicast link {#procedure-for-security-policy-provisioning-for-pc5-unicast-link .H6}

For selectively activating or deactivation the security of the PC5
unicast link, the PCF may provision the security policy per V2X service,
during service authorization and information provisioning procedure as
defined in TS 23.287 \[2\].

##### 5.3.3.1.4.2.3 Security policy handling {#security-policy-handling .H6}

For a NR PC5 unicast link, the UE shall be provisioned with the
following:

\- The list of V2X services, e.g. PSIDs or ITS-AIDs of the V2X
applications, with Geographical Area(s) and their security policy which
indicates the following:

\- Signalling integrity protection: REQUIRED/PREFERRED/NOT NEEDED

\- Signalling confidentiality protection: REQUIRED/PREFERRED/NOT NEEDED

\- User plane integrity protection: REQUIRED/PREFERRED/NOT NEEDED

\- User plane confidentiality protection: REQUIRED/PREFERRED/NOT NEEDED

NOTE 1: No integrity protection on signalling traffic enables services
that do not require security.

> NOTE 2: Ensuring that only a connection with security is used for a
> V2X service is guaranteed if the signalling integrity security policy
> of at least one of the UEs for that V2X service is set to REQUIRED. It
> is recommended to set this security policy to REQUIRED in order to
> guarantee security protection.

NOTE 3: While some V2X applications are similar to Emergency Services
and may require similar security policies handling, such V2X
applications are outside of the scope of 3GPP.

REQUIRED means the UE shall only accept the connection if a non-NULL
confidentiality or integrity algorithm is used for protection of the
traffic.

NOT NEEDED means that the UE shall only establish a connection with no
security.

PREFFERED means that the UE may try to establish security but may will
accept the connection with no security. One use of PREFERRED is to
enable a security policy to be changed without updating all UEs at once.

The handling of signalling security policy proceeds as follows:

\- At initial connection, the initiating UE includes its signalling
security policy in the Direct Communication Request message. The
receiving UE(s) takes this into account when deciding whether to accept
or reject the request and when deciding the agreed security policy to be
sent back in the Direct Security Mode Command message. The initiating UE
can reject the Direct Security Mode Command if the algorithm choice does
not match its policy (see clause 5.3.3.1.4.3 for full details of the
handling).

All the UP data of PC5 unicast link shall have the same security.

The handling of the user plane security policy proceeds with the
following sequence:

a\) At initial connection, the UE that sent the Direct Communications
Request shall include the user plane security policy for the service in
the Direct Security Mode Complete message.

b\) If the signalling confidentiality protection is not activated, then
UEs shall treat their user plane confidentiality policy for the V2X
service for this connection as NOT NEEDED and the receiving UE shall set
confidentiality for the user plane to off. The receiving UE may accept
the Direct Communication Request and the response message (i.e. Direct
Communication Accept) shall include the configuration of not activating
(i.e. set to off) the user plane confidentiality protection.

c\) The receiving UE shall reject the Direct Communication Request when
the following cases occur: 1) if the received user plane security policy
had either confidentiality/integrity set to NOT NEEDED and its own
corresponding policy is set to REQUIRED or, 2) if the received user
plane security policy had either confidentiality/integrity set to
REQUIRED and its own corresponding policy is set to NOT NEEDED.

d\) Otherwise, the receiving UE may accept the Direct Communication
Request and the response message (i.e. Direct Communication Accept)
shall include the configuration of user plane confidentiality protection
based on the agreed user plane security policy, set as follows:

1\) User plane confidentiality protection set to off if the received
user plane security policy had either confidentiality set to NOT NEEDED
and/or its own user plane security policy for the service is set to NOT
NEEDED; or

2\) User plane confidentiality protection set to on if the received user
plane security policy had either confidentiality set to REQUIRED and/or
its own user plane security policy for the service its own corresponding
policy is set to REQUIRED; or

3\) User plane confidentiality protection set to off or on otherwise
(i.e. when both the received user plane security policy and its own user
plane security policy for the service had the confidentiality set to
PREFERRED).

User plane integrity protection set following the same rules as
confidentiality protection but based on the received and its own user
plane integrity protection policy for the service.

NOTE: When both UE's signalling and the user plane security policies are
PREFERRED, the receiving UE sets the confidentiality and/or integrity
protection to on. There might be UE constraints limiting the enablement
of confidentiality and/or integrity protection, e.g. UE hardware
platform resource constraints/limitations.

Due to the purpose of adding a new V2X service to an existing PC5
unicast link, if the signalling and user plane security policies of the
new V2X service are satisfied by the security in use for the PC5 unicast
link, the initiating UE shall send the Link Modification Request to the
receiving UE. The receiving UE shall reject the Link Modification
Request if the security in use for the PC5 unicast link does not match
the signalling and user plane security policies of the new V2X service.

The V2X layer of the UE shall pass the security configurations to its AS
layer. The security configurations are mutually agreed by both sides\'
UEs, including the configuration of confidentiality and integrity
protection.

##### 5.3.3.1.4.3 Security establishment during connection set-up {#security-establishment-during-connection-set-up .H6}

The clause describes how security is established during connection
set-up. The signalling flow is shown in figure 5.3.3.1.4.3-1.

Figure 5.3.3.1.4.3-1: Security establishment at connection set-up

1\. UE\_1 has sent a Direct Communication Request to UE\_2. This message
shall include UE\_1\'s security capabilities (the list of algorithms
that UE\_1 will accept for this connection) and UE\_1\'s signalling
security policy. The UE\_1 shall also include Nonce\_1 (for session key
K~NRP-sess~ generation), and the most significant 8-bits of the
K~NRP-sess~ ID in this message if UE\_1\'s signalling integrity
protection policy is either \"REQUIRED\" or \"PREFERRED\". The most
significant 8-bits of the K~NRP-sess~ ID shall be chosen such that UE\_1
will be able to locally identify a security context that is created by
this procedure using the K~NRP-sess~ ID. The message may also include a
K~NRP~ ID if the UE\_1 has an existing K~NRP~ for the UE that it is
trying to communicate with. The absence of the K~NRP~ ID parameter
indicates that UE\_1 does not have a K~NRP~ for UE\_2. The message also
contains Key\_Est\_Info (see clause 5.3.3.1.3.2).

2\. UE\_2 shall reject the Direct Communication Request if UE\_1\'s
signalling security policy is \"NOT NEEDED\" while UE\_2\'s security
policy is \"REQUIRED\". UE\_2 shall also reject the Direct Communication
Request if UE\_1\'s signalling security policy is \"REQUIRED\" while
UE\_2\'s security policy is \"NOT NEEDED\". UE\_2 may initiate a Direct
Authentication and Key Establishment procedure with UE\_1. This is
mandatory if the UE\_2 does not have the K~NRP~ and K~NRP~ ID pair
indicated in step 1, and signalling is needed to establish the keys for
the particular use case. If the Direct Authentication and Key
Establishment procedure is initiated, the two UEs authenticate each
other using the information exchanged in Key\_Est\_Info, where the used
authentication method is application-specific. (See clause 5.3.3.1.3.2).
During Direct Authentication and Key Establishment procedure, either of
the UE's may reject the authentication procedure.

3\. UE\_2 shall send the Direct Security Mode Command message to UE\_1.
This message shall only contain the MSB of K~NRP~ ID unless the Null
integrity algorithm is selected by UE\_2 and optionally Key\_Est\_Info
if a fresh K~NRP~ is to be generated (see clause 5.3.3.1.3). UE\_2 shall
include the Chosen\_algs parameter to include the selected integrity and
confidentiality algorithm. Non-Null security algorithm in the
Chosen\_algs indicates the corresponding security protection is
activated and the security algorithm the UEs will use to protect the
data in the message. Null security algorithm in the Chosen\_algs
indicates the corresponding security protection is unprotected. The
Chosen\_algs may only indicate the use of the NULL integrity algorithm
if UE\_2\'s signalling integrity security policy is either NOT NEEDED or
PREFERRED. UE\_2 shall also return the UE\_1\'s security capabilities
and UE\_1\'s signalling security policy to provide protection against
bidding down attacks. In the case that the NULL integrity algorithm is
chosen, the NULL confidentiality algorithm shall also be chosen and
UE\_2 shall set the K~NRP-sess~ ID of this security context to the all
zero value.

The following procedures in step 3 shall only be executed if the UE\_2
decides to at least activate the integrity security protection for this
connection: UE\_2 shall also include Nonce\_2 to allow a session key to
be calculated, as well as the least significant 8-bits of K~NRP-sess~ ID
in the messages. These bits are chosen so that UE\_2 will be able to
locally identify a security context that is created by this procedure.
UE\_2 shall calculate K~NRP-Sess~ from K~NRP~ and both Nonce\_1 and
Nonce\_2 (see clause A.3) and then derive the confidentiality (if
applicable) and integrity keys based on the chosen algorithms (clause
A.2). The lower layer shall be provided with the new security context
and indication(s) to signal that the Direct Security Mode Command
message needs integrity protection with the new security context and the
signalling messages can be received using the new security context. The
confidentiality key, NRPEK, shall be derived in this step if and only if
signalling confidentiality protection is activated for this connection.
The integrity protection key, NRPIK, shall be derived in this step if
and only if signalling integrity protection is activated for this
connection. UE\_2 shall integrity protect the Direct Security Mode
Command before sending it to UE\_1. UE\_2 is then ready to receive
signalling and messages protected with the new security context. UE\_2
shall form the K~NRP-sess~ ID from the most significant bits it received
in step1 and least significant bits it sent in step3.

4\. On receiving the Direct Security Mode Command, the UE\_1 shall first
check the Chosen\_algs and shall accept the NULL integrity algorithm
only if its security policy for signalling integrity protection is
either NOT NEEDED or PREFERRED. Then UE\_1 shall check the returned
UE\_1\'s security capabilities and UE\_1\'s signalling security to avoid
bidding down attacks if the NULL integrity algorithm is selected for
signalling integrity protection. If the above check passes, UE\_1 shall
send an unprotected Direct Security Mode Complete message to UE\_2.
UE\_1 shall set the K~NRP-sess~ ID of this security context to the all
zero value.

Under the condition of non-NULL integrity algorithm indicated in the
Chosen\_algs, UE\_1 shall first check that the received LSB of
K~NRP-sess~ ID is unique by checking that it has not been sent by
another UE responding to this Direct Communication Request i.e. such
that resulting K~NRP-sess~ ID is not already being used for another
link. If the LSB of K~NRP-sess~ ID is not unique, then UE\_1 shall
respond with a Direct Security Mode Reject message including a cause
value to specify that the LSB of K~NRP-sess~ ID is not unique. The peer
UE-2 receiving a Direct Security Mode Reject message shall inspect the
cause value and, if the cause is related to the session identifier
uniqueness then, the UE-2 shall generate a new LSB of K~NRP-sess~ ID and
reply to UE-1 again (i.e., UE-2 shall send a Direct Security Mode
Command message with the new LSB of K~NRP-sess~ ID). UE\_2 shall
associate the new LSB of K~NRP-sess~ ID with the security context that
is created in step 3. UE-2 shall erase the former LSB of K~NRP-sess~ ID
from its memory. On receiving this new Direct Security Mode Command,
UE\_1 shall process the message from the start of step 4.

If the LSB of K~NRP-sess~ ID is unique, UE\_1 shall calculate
K~NRP-sess~ and the confidentiality key (if applicable) and integrity
key in the same way as UE\_2. The confidentiality key, NRPEK, shall be
derived in this step if and only if the Chosen\_algs includes non-NULL
confidentiality algorithm. The integrity protection key, NRPIK, shall be
derived in this step if and only if signalling integrity protection is
activated for this connection. UE\_1 shall check that the returned UE\_1
security capabilities and UE\_1\'s signalling security policy are the
same as those it sent in step 1. UE\_1 shall also check the integrity
protection on the message. If both these checks pass, then UE\_1 creates
a security context to be associated with the K~NRP-sess~ ID. UE\_1 is
ready to send and receive signalling and message with the new security
context. The lower layer shall be provided with the new security context
and indication to signal that signalling starting with the Direct
Security Mode Complete needs protection with new security context and
the signalling messages can be received using the new security context.
UE\_1 shall send integrity protected and confidentiality protected (if
applicable) Direct Security Mode Complete message to UE\_2. UE\_1 shall
form the K~NRP-sess~ ID from the most significant bits it sent in step1
and least significant bits it received in step3. K~NRP-sess~ ID is used
to locally identify the security context that is created by this
procedure.

5\. If the Chosen\_algs in step 3 includes non-NULL integrity algorithm,
UE\_2 checks the integrity protection on the received Direct Security
Mode Complete. If this passes, UE\_2 is now ready to send signalling
message and send and receive user plane traffic protected with the new
security context. UE\_2 shall send integrity protected and
confidentiality (if applicable) protected Direct Communication Accept
message to UE\_1 with the new security context. The lower layer shall be
provided with an indication before sending Direct Communication Accept
message to indicate that the signalling message starting with the Direct
Communication Accept is protected with the new security context and an
indication after sending Direct Communication Accept message to indicate
that the user plane traffic is protected with the new security context.
UE\_2 deletes any old security context it has for UE\_1.

6\. After receiving the Direct Communication Accept message, the lower
layer of UE\_1 shall be provided with an indication of activation of the
PC5 unicast user plane security protection for the PC5 unicast link (if
applicable). UE\_1 is now ready to send and receive user plane traffic
protected with the new security context. UE\_1 deletes any old security
context it has for UE\_2.

##### 5.3.3.1.4.4 Security establishment during re-keying {#security-establishment-during-re-keying .H6}

By rekeying, the UEs ensure fresh session keys K~NRP-sess~ are used.
Optionally the rekeying can also enforce refresh of K~NRP~. Either UE
may rekey the connection at any time. This shall be done before the
counter for a PDCP bearer repeats with the current keys. A rekeying
operation shall refresh the K~NRP-sess~ and NRPEK and NRPIK, and may
refresh K~NRP~. There is no benefit in running the rekeying procedure if
the NULL integrity algorithm is in use, hence it is recommended not to
trigger it when using the NULL integrity algorithm. A rekeying operation
follows the flows given in figure 5.3.3.1.4.4-1.

NOTE: The rekeying procedure is not required from security point of view
if the connection is unprotected.

Figure 5.3.3.1.4.4-1: Security establishment during rekeying

1\. UE\_1 sends a Direct Rekey Request to UE\_2. This message shall
include UE\_1 security capabilities (the list of algorithms that UE\_1
will accept for this connection). In addition, if a non-Null integrity
algorithm is in use, the message shall include Nonce\_1 (for session key
generation) and the most significant 8-bits of the K~NRP-sess~ ID. These
bits are chosen such that UE\_1 will be able to locally identify a
security context that is created by this procedure. The message may also
include a Re-auth Flag if UE\_1 wants to rekey K~NRP~. The message also
contains Key\_Est\_Info (see clause 5.3.3.1.3.2).

2\. UE\_2 may initiate a Direct Auth Key Establish procedure with UE\_1.
This is mandatory if UE\_1 included the Re-auth Flag and signalling is
needed to establish K~NRP.~

3\. This step is the same as step 3 in clause 5.3.3.1.4.3 except the
following differences: the chosen integrity algorithm shall only be NULL
if and only if the NULL integrity algorithm is currently in use, the
chosen confidentiality algorithm shall only be NULL if and only if the
NULL confidentiality algorithm is currently in use and UE\_1\'s
signalling security policy is not included in this message. UE\_2 is
then ready to receive both signalling and user plane traffic protected
with the new security context. The lower layer shall be provided with an
indication that the new security context can be used to receive
protected user plane traffic in addition to the indication(s) from step
3 in clause 5.3.3.1.4.3.

4\. This step is the same as step 4 in clause 5.3.3.1.4.3 except the
following differences:the UE\_1 shall only accept the NULL integrity
algorithm if and only if the NULL integrity algorithm is currently in
use, UE\_1 shall only accept the NULL confidentiality algorithm if and
only if the NULL confidentiality algorithm is currently in use, and
UE\_1 does not check the returned signalling security policy (as it is
not sent in this case). UE\_2 is then ready to both send and receive
both signalling and user plane traffic protected with the new security
context. The lower layer shall receive an indication that the new
security context shall be used to send and can be used to receive
protected user plane traffic after the Direct Security Mode Complete
message has been sent in addition to the indications given in step 4.

5\. This step is the same as step 5 in clause 5.3.3.1.4.3 except the
following changes: the Direct Communication Accept message is replaced
by Direct Link Rekeying Response message. There is no need for the
indication to be ready to receive user plane with the new context as
this indication was received at step 3 but the rest of the indication
from step 5 of clause 5.3.3.1.4.3 are needed.

6\. This step is the same as step 6 in clause 5.3.3.1.4.3 except the
following: the Direct Communication Accept message is replaced by Direct
Link Rekeying Response message. No indication to the AS layer is needed
at this step.

##### 5.3.3.1.4.5 Security establishment for user plane bearers {#security-establishment-for-user-plane-bearers .H6}

The UEs handle the user plane security policies as described in clauses
5.3.3.1.4.2.3.

The UE initiating the establishment of a user plane bearer shall select
an LCID whose associated value of Bearer for input to the security
algorithms (see clauses 5.3.3.1.5.2 and 5.3.3.1.5.3) has not been used
with the current keys, NRPEK and NRPIK. If this is not possible the UE
shall initiate a re-keying (see clause 5.3.3.1.4.4) before establishing
the user plane bearer.

When establishing or re-configuring the user plane bearers, the UEs
shall activate the user plane security for the bearers according to the
configuration of confidentiality and integrity protection received from
its V2X layer. The confidentiality and/or integrity protection
algorithms are same as those selected for protecting the signalling
bearers if confidentiality and/or integrity protection are required for
both signalling and user plane. The user plane confidentiality
protection algorithm is the same as the selected signalling
confidentiality algorithm if signalling confidentiality protection is
not activated.

Both UEs shall ensure that the user plane for each V2X service is only
sent or received (e.g. dropped if received on a bearer with incorrect
security) on user plane bearers with the necessary security if security
protection of this link is activated.

##### 5.3.3.1.5 Protection of the PC5 unicast link 

##### 5.3.3.1.5.1 General  {#general-8 .H6}

Protection for the signalling and user plane data between the UEs is
provided at the PDCP layer. As the security is not preserved through a
drop of the connection, all signalling messages that need to be sent
before security is established for a connection may be sent with no
protection. The PC5-S signalling messages that can be sent and processed
unprotected are given in TS 24.587 \[8\]. Once security is established
for a connection all signalling messages for that connection are sent
integrity protected and confidentiality protected with the chosen
algorithms except the Direct Security Mode Command which is sent
integrity protected only.

##### 5.3.3.1.5.2 Integrity protection  {#integrity-protection .H6}

UEs shall implement NIA0, 128-NIA1 and 128-NIA2 and may implement
128-NIA3 for integrity protection of the unicast link. The algorithm
identifiers from clause 5.11.1.2 of TS 33.501 \[6\] are reused for
PC5-S, PC5-RRC, and PC5-U.

These integrity algorithms are as specified in TS 33.501 \[6\] and are
reused with the following modifications:

\- The key used is NRPIK;

\- Direction is set to 1 for direct link signalling transmitted by the
UE that sent the Direct Security Mode Command for this security context
and 0 otherwise;

\- Bearer\[0\] to Bearer\[4\] are set to 5 LSB of LCID;

\- COUNT\[0\] to COUNT\[31\] are filled with counter value (see clause
6.3.5 of TS 38.323 \[9\]).

NOTE: The above input parameters do not apply to NIA0 as specified in
Annex D.1 of TS 33.501 \[6\].

The receiving UE ensures that received protected signalling messages and
user plane data that is integrity protected are not replayed.

##### 5.3.3.1.5.3 Confidentiality protection {#confidentiality-protection .H6}

UEs shall implement NEA0, 128-NEA1 and 128-NEA2 and may implement
128-NEA3 for ciphering of the unicast link. The algorithm identifiers
from clause 5.11.1.1 of TS 33.501 \[6\] are reused for PC5-S, PC5-RRC,
and PC5-U.

These ciphering algorithms are as specified in TS 33.501 \[6\] and are
used with the following modifications:

\- The key used in NRPEK;

\- Direction is set as for integrity protection (see 5.3.3.1.5.2);

\- Bearer\[0\] to Bearer\[4\] are set to 5 LSB of LCID;

\- COUNT\[0\] to COUNT\[31\] are filled with counter value.

NOTE: The above input parameters do not apply to NEA0 as specified in
Annex D.1 of TS 33.501 \[6\].

##### 5.3.3.1.5.4 Content of the PDCP packet {#content-of-the-pdcp-packet .H6}

The Key ID and least significant bits of the counter are carried in the
PDCP header, along with any MAC that is needed for integrity protection
if integrity protection is activated. The key ID is used to signal which
security context is being used and shall be set to K~NRP-sess~ ID. The
payload field and MAC (if required) fields are ciphered if
confidentiality protection is activated.

This is illustrated in Figure 5.3.3.1.5.4-1.

based PC5 unicast mode

#### 5.3.3.2 Identity privacy for the PC5 unicast link 

##### 5.3.3.2.1 General

The link identifier update procedure given in TS 23.287 \[2\] is used to
provide privacy for the identities in the unicast link. This procedure
only provides privacy if a non-NULL confidentiality algorithm is
selected. This means the messages in this procedure are sent
confidentiality protected (i.e. using a non-NULL confidentiality
algorithm) and hence the new identities agreed by the UEs are only known
to the involved UEs. A three-way message exchange procedure is required
with this procedure since both UEs need to change their identifiers
during the same procedure and to allow these new values to be
acknowledged before them being used. *This procedure is used to preserve
the privacy for the identities that are seen in the clear for an ongoing
unicast connection.*

NOTE: From a security point of view, it is assumed that the link
identifier update procedure is used with a protected connection.

A separate privacy threat that allows to link two subsequent connections
is caused by either the same *K~NRP~ ID* or same partial *K~NRP~ ID*
value being sent in the Direct Communication Request message for
subsequent connections. The Layer-2 link release procedure given in TS
23.287 \[2\] is used to provide privacy for the *K~NRP~ ID*. The
messages in the Layer-2 link release procedure are always sent protected
and hence the new *K~NRP~ ID* agreed by the UEs is only known to the
involved UEs.

##### 5.3.3.2.2 Procedures

##### 5.3.3.2.2.1 Link identifier update {#link-identifier-update .H6}

Figure 5.3.3.2.2-1 shows the flows for changing the identities of the
UEs involved in PC5 unicast link. The figure only displays the security
parameters (K~NRP-sess~ ID)that are changed and the Layer-2 IDs but not
the other parameters described in TS 23.287 \[2\].

Figure 5.3.3.2.2.1-1: Link identifier update procedure

The procedure proceeds with the following steps and provides additional
handling on top of what is provided in TS 23.287 \[2\].

0\. UE\_1 and UE\_2 are communicating via a unicast link and have
established the security for the link.

1\. UE\_1 decides to change its identifiers and sends a Link Identifier
Update Request message to UE\_2 (see TS 23.287 \[2\]). In addition to
the changed identifiers, UE\_1 shall include the new MSB of K~NRP-sess~
ID in the Link Identifier Update Request message. These bits shall be
chosen so that they uniquely identify K~NRP-sess~ at UE\_1. The new MSB
of K~NRP-sess~ ID shall be selected randomly.

2\. UE\_2 shall choose the new LSB of K~NRP-sess~ ID so that they
uniquely identify K~NRP-sess~ at UE\_2. The new LSB of K~NRP-sess~ ID
shall be selected randomly. UE\_2 shall form the new K~NRP-sess~ ID from
the MSB received from UE\_1 and the LSB that UE\_2 chose. UE\_2 shall
associate the new K~NRP-sess~ ID with the updated Layer-2 IDs (see TS
23.287 \[2\]) and shall use this new K~NRP-sess~ ID when it uses the
updated Layer-2 IDs. In addition to its updated identifiers, UE\_2 shall
send the LSB of K~NRP-sess~ ID to UE\_1 along with the received MSB of
K~NRP-sess~ ID and other identifiers received from UE\_1 in the Link
Identifier Update Response message. UE\_1 shall check that the returned
MSB of K~NRP-sess~ ID is identical to the one sent in step 1.

3\. UE\_1 shall form the new K~NRP-sess~ ID from the LSB received from
UE\_2 and the MSB chosen by UE\_1 (in step 1). UE\_1 shall associate the
new K~NRP-sess~ ID with the updated Layer-2 IDs (see TS 23.287 \[2\])
and shall use this new K~NRP-sess~ ID when it uses the updated Layer-2
IDs. UE\_1 shall send the Link Identifier Update Ack message to UE\_2
including the LSB of K~NRP-sess~ ID and other identifiers received from
UE\_2. UE\_2 shall check that the returned LSB of K~NRP-sess~ ID are
identical to the one sent in step 2.

##### 5.3.3.2.2.2 Layer-2 link release {#layer-2-link-release .H6}

Figure 5.3.3.2.2.2-2 shows the message flows for changing the *K~NRP~
ID* of the UEs involved in PC5 unicast link to remediate the privacy
threat for the *K~NRP~ ID*. This message flow is based on the Layer-2
link release procedure provided in clause 6.3.3.3 of TS 23.287 \[2\].
The messages in the Layer-2 link release procedure are always sent
protected and hence the new *K~NRP~ ID* agreed by the UEs is only known
to the involved UEs. The new *K~NRP~ ID is used on a subsequent unicast
link establishment procedure (see clause* 5.3.3.1.4.3)*.*

Figure 5.3.3.2.2.2-2: Layer-2 link release procedure

0\. UE\_1 and UE\_2 have a unicast link established as described in TS
23.287 \[2\].

1\. UE\_1 sends a Disconnect Request message to UE\_2 in order to
release the layer-2 link (see TS 23.287 \[2\]). UE\_1 shall include the
new MSB of K~NRP~ ID in the Disconnect Request message. These bits shall
be chosen so that they uniquely identify K~NRP~ at UE\_1. The new MSB of
K~NRP~ ID shall be selected randomly.

2\. UE\_2 shall choose the new LSB of K~NRP~ ID so that they uniquely
identify K~NRP~ at UE\_2. The new LSB of K~NRP~ ID shall be selected
randomly. UE\_2 shall form the new K~NRP~ ID from the MSB received from
UE\_1 and the LSB that UE\_2 chose. UE\_2 may use this new K~NRP~ ID
when it reconnects with UE\_1. UE\_2 shall send the LSB of K~NRP~ ID to
UE\_1 in the Disconnect Response message. Upon reception of the
Disconnect Response message, UE\_1 shall form the new K~NRP~ ID from the
LSB received from UE\_2 and the MSB that was chosen by UE\_1 (in step
1). UE\_1 may use this new K~NRP~ ID when it reconnects with UE\_2.

prefix (if used) at other times (e.g. see clause 5.6.1.1 in TS 23.287
\[2\]). The UE shall provide an indication to the V2X application layer
whenever the source Layer-2 ID and/or source IP address are changed.

NOTE: There are no additional procedures defined for privacy of
destination Layer-2 ID in this release.

5.5 Security for broadcast mode

address are the same as that given in clause 5.4.3.2 for the source
identities in the UE.

6 Security for V2X over Uu reference point
==========================================

6.1 General
-----------

This clause contains the security and privacy requirements and
procedures that meet the requirements over Uu connectivity with 5G core
network.

6.2 Requirements
----------------

There are no additional security or privacy requirements for V2X beyond
those given in TS 33.501 \[6\] for Uu connectivity with 5G core network.

6.3 Procedures
--------------

There are no additional security or privacy procedures of V2X beyond
those given in TS 33.501 \[6\] for Uu connectivity with 5G core network.

NOTE: The present document does not provide technical solutions to
address any privacy concerns specific to V2X service that require
privacy for a UE being attached to the network, or that due to the data
traversing the network in Uu mode. However, there are general privacy
principles applicable outside of 3GPP scope; data minimization and user
consent if privacy impacting data collection is unavoidable for
providing the V2X service.
