Foreword
========

This Technical Specification has been produced by the 3rd Generation
Partnership Project (3GPP).

The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work
within the TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the
TSG modify the contents of the present document, it will be re-released
by the TSG with an identifying change of release date and an increase in
version number as follows:

Version x.y.z

where:

x the first digit:

1 presented to TSG for information;

y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e.
technical enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.

z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been
incorporated in the document.

In the present document, modal verbs have the following meanings:

**shall** indicates a mandatory requirement to do something

**shall not** indicates an interdiction (prohibition) to do something

The constructions \"shall\" and \"shall not\" are confined to the
context of normative provisions, and do not appear in Technical Reports.

The constructions \"must\" and \"must not\" are not used as substitutes
for \"shall\" and \"shall not\". Their use is avoided insofar as
possible, and they are not used in a normative context except in a
direct citation from an external, referenced, non-3GPP document, or so
as to maintain continuity of style when extending or modifying the
provisions of such a referenced document.

**should** indicates a recommendation to do something

**should not** indicates a recommendation not to do something

**may** indicates permission to do something

**need not** indicates permission not to do something

The construction \"may not\" is ambiguous and is not used in normative
elements. The unambiguous constructions \"might not\" or \"shall not\"
are used instead, depending upon the meaning intended.

**can** indicates that something is possible

**cannot** indicates that something is impossible

The constructions \"can\" and \"cannot\" are not substitutes for \"may\"
and \"need not\".

**will** indicates that something is certain or expected to happen as a
result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside
the scope of the present document

**will not** indicates that something is certain or expected not to
happen as a result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which
is outside the scope of the present document

**might** indicates a likelihood that something will happen as a result
of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document

**might not** indicates a likelihood that something will not happen as a
result of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside
the scope of the present document

In addition:

**is** (or any other verb in the indicative mood) indicates a statement
of fact

**is not** (or any other negative verb in the indicative mood) indicates
a statement of fact

The constructions \"is\" and \"is not\" do not indicate requirements.

4.1 Introduction
----------------

SMF specific security requirements include both SMF-specific security
functional requirements in relevant specifications as well as security
requirements introduced in the present document derived from the threats
specific to SMF as described in TR 33.926 \[4\].

4.2 SMF-specific adaptations of security functional requirements and related test cases
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 4.2.1 Introduction

Present clause contains SMF-specific security functional adaptations of
requirements and related test cases.

### 4.2.2 Security functional requirements on the SMF deriving from 3GPP specifications and related test cases

#### 4.2.2.1 Security functional requirements on the SMF deriving from 3GPP specifications 

#### 4.2.2.1.0 General

The general approach in TS 33.117 \[2\] clause 4.2.2.1 and all the
requirements and test cases in TS 33.117 \[2\] clause 4.2.2.2 related to
SBA/SBI aspect apply to the SMF network product class.

##### 4.2.2.1.1 Priority of UP security policy

> *Requirement Name*: Priority of UP security policy
>
> *Requirement Reference:* TS 23.501 \[1\], clause 5.10.3
>
> *Requirement Description*: \"User Plane Security Policy from UDM takes
> precedence over locally configured User Plane Security Policy.\" as
> specified in TS 23.501 \[1\], clause 5.10.3
>
> *Threat References*: TR 33.926 \[4\], clause J.2.2.1 Non-compliant UP
> security policy handling
>
> *Test Case*:
>
> **Test Name: TC\_UP\_POLICY\_PRECEDENCE\_SMF**
>
> **Purpose:**
>
> Verify that the user plane security policy from the UDM takes
> precedence at the SMF under test over locally configured user plane
> security policy.
>
> **Pre-Conditions:**
>
> Test environment with AMF and UDM may be simulated.
>
> Both UDM and SMF under test are configured with UP security policy,
> and the UP security policies are different.
>
> There is no Session Management Subscription data in SMF.
>
> **Execution Steps**

1\) The tester triggers PDU session establishment procedure by sending
Nsmf\_PDUSession\_CreateSMContext Request message to the SMF.

2\) The SMF under test retrieves the Session Management Subscription
data using Nudm\_SDM\_Get service from UDM, where the Session Management
Subscription data includes the user plane security policy stored in UDM.

3\) The tester captures the Namf\_Communication\_N1N2MessageTransfer
message sent from the SMF under test to the AMF.

> **Expected Results:**
>
> There is a Security Indication IE in the N2 SM information contained
> in the Namf\_Communication\_N1N2MessageTransfer message, which is the
> same with the UP security policy configured in the UDM.
>
> **Expected format of evidence:**
>
> Evidence suitable for the interface, e.g., Screenshot containing the
> operational results.

##### 4.2.2.1.2 Void

##### 4.2.2.1.3 Security functional requirements on the SMF checking UP security policy 

*Requirement Name:* UP security policy check.

*Requirement Reference:* TS 33.501 \[8\], clause 6.6.1

*Requirement Description:*

\"The SMF shall verify that the UE\'s UP security policy received from
the target ng-eNB/gNB is the same as the UE\'s UP security policy that
the SMF has locally stored. If there is a mismatch, the SMF shall send
its locally stored UE\'s UP security policy of the corresponding PDU
sessions to the target gNB. This UP security policy information, if
included by the SMF, is delivered to the target ng-eNB/gNB in the
Path-Switch Acknowledge message. The SMF shall log capabilities for this
event and may take additional measures, such as raising an alarm. \"

*Threat References:* TR 33.926 \[4\], clause J.2.2.4, Unchecked UP
security policy.

**TEST CASE:**

**Test Name:** TC\_UP\_SECURITY\_POLICY \_SMF

**Purpose:**

Verify that the SMF checks the UP security policy that is sent by the
ng-eNB/gNB during handover.

**Pre-Conditions:**

The SMF under test is preconfigured with a UE UP security policy.

**Execution**

1\. The tester sends the Nsmf\_PDUSession\_UpdateSMContext Request
message to the SMF under test. A UE UP security policy different than
the one preconfigured at the SMF under test is included in the Request
message.

2\. The tester captures the Nsmf\_PDUSession\_UpdateSMContext Response
message sent from the SMF under test.

**Expected Results:**

The preconfigured UE security policy is contained in the 'n2SmInf' IE in
the captured Response message.

**Expected format of evidence:**

Files containing the triggered GTP messages (e.g. pcap trace).

##### 4.2.2.1.4 Charging ID Uniqueness

*Requirement Name:* Charing ID uniqueness.

*Requirement Reference:* TS 32.255 \[6\], clause 5.1.2

*Requirement Description:* :

\"- The SMF shall support PDU session charging using service based
interface.

\- The SMF shall collect charging information per PDU session for UEs
served under 3GPP access and non-3GPP access.

\- Every PDU session shall be assigned a unique identity number for
billing purposes per PLMN. (i.e. the Charging Id). \"

*Threat Reference:* TR 33.926 \[4\], clause J.2.2.3, \"Failure to assign
unique Charging ID for a session\"

**TEST CASE:**

**Test Name:** TC\_CHARGING\_ID\_UNIQUENESS\_SMF

**Purpose:**

Verify that the charging ID generated by the SMF for each PDU session is
unique.

**Pre-Conditions:**

Test environment is set up with a Charging Function (CHF), which may be
real or simulated, and the SMF under test. The tester is able to capture
the traffic between the SMF under test and the CHF.

**Execution Step**

1\) The tester intercepts the traffic between the SMF under test and the
CHF.

2\) The tester triggers the establishment of the maximum number of
concurrent PDU sessions that the SMF under test can handle.

3\) The tester captures each Charging Data Request \[initial\] sent from
the SMF under test to the CHF, and verifies the charging ID contained in
the 'PDU Session Charging Information' IE in each Charging Data Request
\[initial\] is unique.

**Expected Results:**

The charging ID in each Charging Data Request \[initial\] is unique.

**Expected format of evidence:**

Files containing the Charging Data Request \[initial\] messages (e.g.
pcap trace).
