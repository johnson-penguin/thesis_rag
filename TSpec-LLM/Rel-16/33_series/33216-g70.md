> screenshot.

*Test Case 2:*

**Test Name:** TC\_ENB\_KEY\_REFRESH\_DRB\_ID

**Purpose:**

Verify that the eNB performs K~eNB~ refresh when DRB-IDs are about to be
reused under the following conditions:

-   the successive Radio Bearer establishment uses the same RB identity
    while the PDCP COUNT is reset to 0, or

-   the PDCP COUNT is reset to 0 but the RB identity is increased after
    multiple calls and wraps around.

**Pre-Conditions:**

The UE and MME may be simulated.

**Execution Steps**

1\) The eNB sends the AS Security Mode Command message to the UE.

2\) the UE responds with the AS Security Mode Complete message.

3\) A DRB is set up.

4\) DRB is set up and torn down for multiple times within one active
radio connection without the UE going to idle (e.g. by the UE making
multiple IMS calls, or by the MME requesting bearer setup and bearer
deactivation), until the DRB ID is reused.

**Expected Results:**

Before DRB ID reuse, the eNB takes a new K~eNB~ into use by e.g.
triggering an intra-cell handover or triggering a transition from
RRC\_CONNECTED to RRC\_IDLE or RRC\_INACTIVE and then back to
RRC\_CONNECTED.

**Expected format of evidence:**

Part of log that shows all the DRB identities and the intra-cell
handover or the transition from RRC\_CONNECTED to RRC\_IDLE or
RRC\_INACTIVE and then back to RRC\_CONNECTED. This part can be
presented, for example, as a screenshot.

*Requirement Name*: AS protection algorithm selection in eNB change.

*Requirement Reference:* TS 33.401 \[3\], clause 7.2.4.2.2, and
clause 7.2.4.2.3

*Requirement Description*: \"The target eNB shall select the algorithm
with highest priority from the UE EPS security capabilities according to
the prioritized locally configured list of algorithms (this applies for
both integrity and ciphering algorithms). The chosen algorithms shall be
indicated to the UE in the handover command if the target eNB selects
different algorithms compared to the source eNB\" as specified in TS
33.401 \[3\], clause 7.2.4.2.2, and clause 7.2.4.2.3.

*Threat References*: TBA

*Test Case*:

**Purpose:**

*Requirement Description:* \"The eNB shall start RRC and UP downlink
ciphering after sending the AS security mode command message\" .

*Threat References:* TBA

*Test Case:*

**Test Name:** TC\_eNB\_DL\_Cipher

**Purpose:** To verify that the eNB performs RRC and UP downlink
ciphering after sending the AS security mode command message.

**Pre-Condition:**

\- The UE and eNB network products are connected in the test
environment. UE may be simulated.

\- The tester shall have access to the AS security context and the
corresponding cryptographic keys (e.g. RRC and UP cipher keys).

\- The tester has access to Uu interface and ability to capture the Uu
interface messages with the debug port enabled in the UE.

**Execution Steps:**

1\) The tester shall POWER ON the UE to trigger the registration
procedures (Attach and SMC).

2\) The tester performs packet capturing over the Uu interface using any
packet analyser.

3\) The tester filters the AS SMC command message and the following RRC
and UP downlink packets from eNB to UE.

4\) The tester proceeds the testing based on the parameters (algorithm
identifier and algorithm distinguisher) present in the AS SMC command
message.

Case 1: If the parameters refer to null ciphering algorithm, the tester
verifies that the downlink packets filtered in step 3 are unciphered.

Case 2: If the parameters refer to algorithms such as SNOW, AES, ZUC,
the tester verifies that the downlink packets filtered in step 3 are
ciphered.

> The tester also checks if the packets are ciphered in accordance with
> the selected algorithm stated in the AS SMC command message.

NOTE: The requirement mentioned in this clause is tested in accordance
with the procedure mentioned in clause 4.2.3.2.4 of TS 33.117 \[2\].
