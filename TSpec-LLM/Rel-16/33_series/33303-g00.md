4 Overview of ProSe security
============================

4.1 General
-----------

The overall architecture for ProSe is given in TS 23.303 \[2\]. ProSe
includes several features that may be deployed independently of each
other. For this reason, no overall security architecture is provided and
each feature describes its own architecture.

Although made of several different features, those features share many
procedures, for example, both ProSe Direct Discovery and ProSe Direct
Communication utilize the same procedure for service authorization (see
TS 23.303 \[2\]). Security for this common procedures are described in
clause 5 of the present document, while the overall security of the
ProSe features is described in clause 6 of the present document (which
refers back to clause 5 as necessary).

4.2 Reference points and Functional Entities
--------------------------------------------

> **PC8**: The reference point between the UE and the ProSe Key
> Management Function. PC8 relies on EPC user plane for transport (i.e.
> an \"over IP\" reference point). It is used to transport security
> material to UEs for ProSe one-to-many communications.

5 Common security procedures
============================

5.1 General
-----------

This clause contains a description of the security procedures that are
used by more than one ProSe feature.

5.2 Network domain security
---------------------------

### 5.2.1 General

ProSe uses several interfaces between network entities, e.g. PC4a
between the ProSe Function and the HSS\
(see TS 23.303 \[2\]). This subclause describes the security for those
interfaces.

### 5.2.2 Security requirements

The ProSe network entities shall be able to authenticate the source of
the received data communications.

The transmission of data between ProSe network entities shall be
integrity protected.

The transmission of data between ProSe network entities shall be
confidentiality protected.

The transmission of data between ProSe network entities shall be
protected from replays.

### 5.2.3 Security procedures

For all interfaces between network elements,

> TS 33.210 \[3\] shall be applied to secure signalling messages on the
> reference points unless specified otherwise, and
>
> TS 33.310 \[4\] may be applied regarding the use of certificates with
> the security mechanisms of TS 33.210 \[3\] unless specified otherwise
> in the present document.

NOTE: For the case of an interface between two entities in the same
security domain, TS 33.210 \[3\] does not mandate the protection of the
interface by means of IPsec.

5.3 Security of UE to ProSe Function interface
----------------------------------------------

### 5.3.1 General

The ProSe-enabled UEs have many interactions with the ProSe Function
over the PC3 in the ProSe features described in TS 23.303 \[2\].

### 5.3.2 Security requirements

Only the ProSe Function may provide configuration data impacting the
ProSe-related network operations to the ProSe-enabled UE. 3rd parties
shall not be allowed to provide such parameters.

The ProSe-enabled UE and the ProSe Function shall mutually authenticate
each other.

The transmission of configuration data between the ProSe Function and
the ProSe-enabled UE shall be integrity protected.

The transmission of configuration data between the ProSe Function and
the ProSe-enabled UE shall be confidentiality protected.

The transmission of configuration data between the ProSe Function and
the ProSe-enabled UE shall be protected from replays.

The configuration data shall be stored in the UE in a protected way to
prevent modification.

Some configuration data may require to be stored in the UE in a
protected way to prevent eavesdropping.

The transmission of UE identity should be confidentiality protected on
PC3 interface.

### 5.3.3 Security procedures

#### 5.3.3.1 Security procedures for configuration transfer to the UICC

After deployment of the ProSe-enabled UE the configuration parameters
stored in the UICC may need to be updated to reflect the changes in the
configuration applied.

In case that configuration data of ProSe-enabled UE are stored in the
UICC, the UICC OTA mechanism (as specified in ETSI TS 102 225 \[6\] / TS
102 226 \[7\] and 3GPP TS 31.115 \[8\] / TS 31.116 \[9\]) shall be used
to secure the transfer of the configuration data to be updated in the
UICC.

#### 5.3.3.2 Security procedures for data transfer to the UE

This subclause describes procedures for protecting data transfer between
UE and ProSe Function (called the network function in the below
procedures).Between the UE and network function,

for UE initiated messages, the procedures specified by clause 5.4 of TS
33.222 \[22\] shall be used with the following addition. The network
function may optionally include an indication in the PSK-identity hint
in the ServerKeyExchange message over the Ua interface to inform the UE
of the FQDN of the BSF with which the UE shall run the bootstrapping
procedure over the Ub interface as specified in TS 33.220\[5\] to
provide the key material for establishment of the TLS tunnel. When
performing such bootstrapping with the indicated BSF, the UE and BSF
shall use the provided FQDN as the BSF Identity in all places, e.g.
forming the B-TID. If there is no such indication, the UE shall perform
the bootstrapping with the BSF at the address given in TS 23.003 \[39\].

The UE may also hold a B-TID, Ks and other associated material from
bootstrapping runs with different BSFs simultaneously.

A network function that implements the NAF functionality (cf Annex F.2
or Annex F.3) shall request USSs from the BSF when requesting the
Ks\_(ext/int)\_NAF key and the network function shall check in the USS
if the USIM is authorized to be used for ProSe services. If the
authorization in the network function fails then the network function
shall release the PSK-TLS connection with the UE. Otherwise (cf Annex
F.4) the retrieval of authentication vectors and authorization of the
ProSe UE shall be performed using the PC4a interface instead of the Zh
interface. If the ProSe Function does not have a unused Authentication
vector associated with the ProSe UE, the ProSe Function shall request
one Authentication Vector from the HSS over the PC4a interface. ProSe
Function shall always indicate to the UE, in the Ua message carrying the
ServerKeyExchange of the PSK-TLS handshake, that the Ks\_NAF key shall
be used to bootstrap the PSK-TLS security on the PC3 interface, by
setting the psk\_identity\_hint field to a static string
\"3GPP-bootstrapping\".

NOTE 1: Annex F describes the possible network options for PC3 security.
The UE behaviour remains the same regardless of the network option used.

NOTE 2: When the termination points of both the Ua and Ub interfaces
reside in the network function then the implementation of the Zn
interface is an operator decision. However, if the operator considers
deploying a stand-alone BSF for use by the network function, then the
operator should use the canonical BSF name from TS 23.003 and the Zn
interface should be available in the network function already from the
start although it would only be used internally to the network function
until a stand-alone BSF was deployed. Otherwise, implementation changes
to the network function will become necessary at the time of introducing
the stand-alone BSF.

For network initiated messages one of the following mechanisms shall be
used:

\- If a PSK TLS connection has been established as a part of a pull
message and is still available, the available PSK TLS session shall be
used.

\- Otherwise, PSK TLS with GBA push based shared key-based mutual
authentication between the UE and the network function shall be used.
GBA push is specified in TS 33.223 \[38\]. The network function
(pushNAF) shall request USSs from the BSF when requesting a GPI, and the
network function shall check in the USS if the USIM is authorized to be
used for ProSe services. If the authorization in the network function
fails then the network function shall refrain from establish PSK TLS
with GBA push.

NOTE 3: If a TLS connection is released, it can only be re-established
by the client, i.e. UE, even though the TLS session including security
association would be alive on both sides. TLS connection, in turn, is
dependent on the underlying TCP connection.

5.4 Security of the PC2 reference point
---------------------------------------

### 5.4.1 Requirements on PC2 reference point 

When the the ProSe Application Server is controlled by a 3rd party, then
the PC2 reference point shall fulfil the following requirements:

Integrity protection, replay protection, confidentiality protection and
privacy protection for communication between the ProSe Function and
ProSe Application Server shall be supported;

\- mutual authentication between ProSe Function and ProSe Application
Server shall be supported;

\- integrity protection and replay protection shall be used;

\- confidentiality protection should be used;

\- privacy of the 3GPP user shall be provided (e.g. IMSI shall not be
sent outside the 3GPP operator's domain);

the ProSe Function in the 3GPP network shall be able to determine
whether the ProSe Application Server is authorized to send request
messages to the ProSe Function in the 3GPP network;

### 5.4.2 Security procedures for PC2 reference point

The security procedure defined for the Tsp interface in TS 29.368 \[41\]
shall be supported and used for the PC2 reference point, where the ProSe
Function takes the role as the MTC-IWF and the ProSe Application Server
takes the role as the SCS.

6 Security for ProSe features
=============================

6.1 ProSe direct discovery
--------------------------

### 6.1.1 Overview of ProSe direct discovery in network coverage

The Direct Discovery in network coverage feature in clause 5.2 and 5.3
of TS 23.303 \[2\] describes several procedures applicable for open
discovery, model A.\
They are the following:

1\. The **Service Authorization** procedure: The UE contacts the ProSe
Function(s) in the HPLMN in order to obtain authorization to use direct
discovery in the various PLMNs. This step also includes the ability of
the HPLMN to revoke authorization via a push message.

2\. The **Discovery Request** procedure: This allows an announcing or a
monitoring UE to obtain the necessary configuration information to be
able to announce a code or monitor for codes in a particular PLMN. Among
other things, the configuration information includes the ProSe
Application Codes to be announced or Discovery Filters to be monitored
for.

3\. The **Discovery** procedure: The ProSe App Code is announced by the
announcing UE and received by the monitoring UE.

> 4\. The **Match Report** procedure: This allows a ProSe App Code
> received by the monitoring UE to be checked and confirmed by the
> network. As part of this procedure the network provides the UE with
> the ProSe Application Id Name of that code and possibly the meta-data
> corresponding to that ProSe Application ID Name.

The same procedures are also used for model A and B restricted discovery
(see TS 23.303 \[2\] for more details).

### 6.1.2 Security requirements

Procedures 1, 2, and 4 include traffic between the UE and ProSe
Function, between other network entities and over the PC2 reference
point, therefore the requirements in clause 5.3.2, 5.2.2 and 5.4.1 apply
to this case.

In addition, for the overall open discovery procedure, the following
security requirement applies:

The system shall support a method to mitigate the replay and
impersonation attacks for ProSe open discovery.

For Restricted Discovery, the following requirements apply:

ProSe Restricted discovery shall allow a UE to discover only other UEs
which it is currently authorized to discover. That is, the identities
announced on the air interface shall be able to be protected from being
understood by currently unauthorized UEs.

The possibility of tracking of UEs based on the content of their
discovery messages over time should be minimized.

The possibility of replay attacks on discovery messages sent over the
air interface should be minimized.

The system shall support the prevention of impersonation attacks.

The system shall support integrity protection and confidentiality
protection of Restricted Discovery ProSe Codes.

NOTE 1: Any structure present in the ProSe Code before any security
processing should be preserved to enable checking for matches.
Preserving the structure needs to be done in a way that does not affect
the security.

NOTE 2: These requirements apply to both model A and model B restricted
discovery.

NOTE 3: The restricted discovery system requirements above indicate
mandatory support of the various protection mechanisms. The Prose
Function decides which of these mechanisms are applied to a specific
discovery (i.e. it is not mandatory to apply all the protection
mechanisms to each discovery).

### 6.1.3 Security procedures

#### 6.1.3.1 Interface between the UE and ProSe Function

In order to protect the messages between the UE and ProSe Function over
PC3, the UE shall support the procedures for the UE given in subclause
5.3.3.2 and the ProSe Function shall support the procedures for the
network function given in subclause 5.3.3.2. In order to protect the
messages between the UE and ProSe Function CTF (ADF) (Accounting Data
Forwarding function block of the Charging Trigger Function) over PC3ch,
the same communication security shall apply for PC3ch as is used for
PC3.

#### 6.1.3.2 Interfaces between network elements

This uses the procedures described in clause 5.2.3 of the present
document, except the PC2 interface which uses the procedures in clause
5.4.2.

#### 6.1.3.3 Integrity protection and validation of the transmitted code for open discovery

##### 6.1.3.3.1 Open discovery security flows

The message flows apply when both the UEs are roaming or when one or
both are in their HPLMN.

Note that integrity protection via this Message Integrity Check (MIC)
furthermore enables the ProSe Function to verify that the announcing UE
was indeed authorized to announce this ProSe App Code at that time
instance. A UTC-based counter associated with the discovery slot is used
to calculate the MIC and verify the MIC. To help ensure that the
announcing and monitoring UEs end up with the same value of the
UTC-based counter, the announcing UE includes the 4 least significant
bits of its couter value in the discovery message, which the monitoring
UE uses when setting the value of the UTC-based counter that is passed
to the ProSe Function.

Figure: 6.1.3.3.1-1: Integrity protection of the transmitted code

1\. The Announcing UE sends a Discovery Request message containing the
ProSe Application ID to the ProSe Function in its HPLMN in order to be
allowed to announce a code on its serving PLMN (either VPLMN or HPLMN).

2./3. If the announcing UE wants to send announcements while in the
VPLMN, it needs to be authorised from the VPLMN ProSe Function: The
ProSe Function in the HPLMN requests authorization for sending
announcements from the VPLMN ProSe Function by sending Announce Auth.()
message. VPLMN ProSe Function responds with an Announce Auth. Ack ()
message, if authorization is granted. There are no changes to these
messages for the purpose of protecting the transmitted code for open
discovery. If the Announcing UE is not roaming, these steps do not take
place.

4\. The ProSe Function in HPLMN of the announcing UE returns the ProSe
App Code that the announcing UE can announce and a 128-bit Discovery Key
associated with it. The ProSe Function stores the Discovery Key with the
ProSe App Code. In addition, the ProSe Function provides the UE with a
CURRENT\_TIME parameter, which contains the current UTC-based time at
the ProSe Function, a MAX\_OFFSET parameter, and a Validity Timer (see
TS 23.303 \[2\]). The UE sets a clock which is used for ProSe
authentication (i.e. ProSe clock) to the value of CURRENT\_TIME and the
UE stores the MAX\_OFFSET parameter, overwriting any previous values.
The announcing UE obtains a value for a UTC-based counter associated
with a discovery slot based on UTC time. The counter is set to a value
of UTC time in a granularity of seconds. The UE may obtain UTC time from
any sources available, e.g. the RAN via SIB16, NITZ, NTP, GPS, via Ub
interface (in GBA) (depending on which is available).

NOTE 1: The UE may use unprotected time to obtain the UTC-based counter
associated with a discovery slot. This means that the discovery message
could be successfully replayed if a UE is fooled into using a time
different to the current time. The MAX\_OFFSET parameter is used to
limit the ability of an attacker to successfully replay discovery
messages or obtain correctly MICed discovery message for later use. This
is achieved by using MAX\_OFFSET as a maximum difference between the
UTC-based counter associated with the discovery slot and the ProSe clock
held by the UE.

NOTE 2: A discovery slot is the time at which an announcing UE sends the
announcement.

5\. The UE starts announcing, if the difference between UTC-based
counter provided by the system associated with the discovery slot and
the UE's ProSe clock is not greater than the MAX\_OFFSET and if the
Validity Timer has not expired (see TS 23.303 \[2\]).For each discovery
slot it uses to announce, the announcing UE calculates a 32-bit Message
Integrity Check (MIC) to include with the ProSe App Code in the
discovery message. Four least significant bits of UTC-based counter are
transmitted along with the discovery message. The MIC is calculated as
described in sub clause A.2 using the Discovery Key and the UTC-based
counter associated with the discovery slot.

6\. The Monitoring UE sends a Discovery Request message containing the
ProSe Application ID to the ProSe Function in its HPLMN in order to get
the Discovery Filters that it wants to listen for.

7/8. The ProSe Functions in the HPLMN of the monitoring UE and HPLMN of
the announcing UEs exchange Monitor Req./Resp. messages. There are no
changes to these messages for the purpose of protecting the transmitted
code for open discovery.

9\. The ProSe Function returns the Discovery Filter containing either
the ProSe App Code(s), the ProSe App Mask(s) or both along with the
CURRENT\_TIME and the MAX\_OFFSET parameters. The UE sets its ProSe
clock to CURRENT\_TIME and stores the MAX\_OFFSET parameter, overwriting
any previous values. The monitoring UE obtains a value for a UTC-based
counter associated with a discovery slot based on UTC time. The counter
is set to a value of UTC time in a granularity of seconds. The UE may
obtain UTC time from any sources available, e.g. the RAN via SIB16,
NITZ, NTP, GPS (depending on which is available).

10\. The Monitoring UE listens for a discovery message that satisfies
its Discovery Filter, if the difference between UTC-based counter
associated with that discovery slot and UE's ProSe clock is not greater
than the MAX\_OFFSET of the monitoring UE\'s ProSe clock.

11\. On hearing such a discovery message, and if the UE has either not
checked the MIC for the discovered ProSe App Code previously or has
checked a MIC for the ProSe App Code and the associated Match Report
refresh timer (see steps 14 and 15 for details of this timer) has
expired, or as required based on the procedures specified in TS 23.303
\[2\], the Monitoring UE sends a Match Report message to the ProSe
Function in the HPLMN of the monitoring UE. The Match Report contains
the UTC-based counter value with four least significant bits equal to
four least significant bits received along with discovery message and
nearest to the monitoring UE's UTC-based counter associated with the
discovery slot where it heard the announcement, and other discovery
message parameters including the ProSe App Code and MIC.

12\. The ProSe Function in the HPLMN of the monitoring UE passes the
discovery message parameters including the ProSe App Code and MIC and
associated counter parameter to the ProSe Function in the HPLMN of the
announcing UE in the Match Report message.

13\. The ProSe Function in the HPLMN of the announcing UE shall check
the MIC is valid. The relevant Discovery Key is found using the ProSe
App Code.

14\. The ProSe Function in the HPLMN of the announcing UE shall
acknowledge a successful check of the MIC to the ProSe Function in the
HPLMN of the monitoring UE in the Match Report Ack message. The ProSe
Function in the HPLMN of the announcing UE shall include a Match Report
refresh timer in the Match Report Ack message. The Match Report refresh
timer indicates how long the UE will wait before sending a new Match
Report for the ProSe App Code.

15\. The ProSe Function in the HPLMN of the monitoring UE returns an
acknowledgement that the integrity checked passed to the Monitoring UE.
The ProSe Function returns the parameter ProSe Application ID to the
UE.\
It also provides the CURRENT\_TIME parameter, by which the UE (re)sets
its ProSe clock The ProSe Function in the HPLMN of the monitoring UE may
optionally modify the received Match Report refresh timer based on local
policy and then shall include the Match Report refresh timer in the
message to the Monitoring UE..

#### 6.1.3.4 Restricted discovery

##### 6.1.3.4.1 General

The security for both models of restricted discovery is similar to that
of open discovery described in subclause 6.1.3.3. Both models also use a
UTC-based counter (see step 9 in clause 6.1.3.3) to provide freshness
for the protection of the restricted discovery message on the PC5
interface. The parameters CURRENT\_TIME and MAX\_OFFSET are also
provided to the UE from the ProSe Function in its HPLMN to ensure that
the obtained UTC-based counter is sufficiently close to real time to
protect against replays.

The major differences are that restricted discovery requires
confidentiality protection of the discovery messages (e.g. to ensure a
UE is not discovered by unauthorized parties or tracked due to
constantly sending the same ProSe Restricted/Response Code in the clear)
and that the MIC checking may be performed by the receiving UE (if
allowed by the ProSe Function).

The security parameter needed by a sending UE to protect a discovery
message (i.e., in model A the announcing UE and in model B the
Discoverer UE sending the ProSe Query Code and the Discoveree UE sending
the ProSe Response Code) are provided in the Code-Sending Security
Parameters. Similarly the security parameters needed by a UE receiving a
discovery message (i.e., in model A the monitoring UE and in model B the
Discoverer UE receiving a ProSe Response Code and the Discoveree
receiving a ProSe Query Code) are provided in the Code-Receiving
Security Parameters.

##### 6.1.3.4.2 Security flows

###### 6.1.3.4.2.1 Model A security flows

This subclause contains the message flows for the protection of a model
A restricted discovery. The flows show how a particular discovery is
protected. The exact details of the actual protection to be applied to a
discovery message are given in subclause 6.1.3.4.3. The message flows
apply when both the UEs are roaming or when one or both are in their
HPLMN. If either of the UEs is not roaming some steps in the flows are
omitted as detailed in the flows.

The flows are broken down into 4 boxed stages to better relate to the
procedures given in TS 23.303 \[2\]. The first, second and fourth stage
correspond to subclause 5.3.3.4A, 5.3.3.5A and 5.3.4.2A of TS 23.303
\[2\] respectively. The interaction between the ProSe Function(s) and
HSS is omitted for simplicity.

Figure 6.1.3.4.2.1-1: Flows for securing model A restricted discovery

Steps 1-4 refer to an Announcing UE.

1\. Announcing UE sends a Discovery Request message containing the
RPAUID to the ProSe Function in its HPLMN in order to get the ProSe Code
to announce and to get the associated security material. The command
indicates that this is for announce (Model A) operation, i.e. for an
Announcing UE.

2\. The ProSe Function may check for the announce authorization with the
ProSe Application Server depending on ProSe Function configuration.

3\. The ProSe Functions in the HPLMN and VPLMN of the Announcing UE
exchange Announce Auth. messages. If the Announcing UE is not roaming,
these steps do not take place.

4\. The ProSe Function in the HPLMN of the Announcing UE returns the
ProSe Code and the corresponding Code-Sending Security Parameters, along
with the CURRENT\_TIME and MAX\_OFFSET parameters. The Code-Sending
Security Parameters provide the necessary information for the Announcing
UE to protect the transmission of the ProSe Code (see subclause
6.1.3.4.3.2) and are stored with the ProSe Code. The Announcing UE takes
the same actions with CURRENT\_TIME and MAX\_OFFSET as described for the
Announcing UE in step 4 of subclause 6.1.3.3.1 of the current
specification.

Steps 5-10 refer to a Monitoring UE

5\. The Monitoring UE sends a Discovery Request message containing the
RPAUID to the ProSe Function in its HPLMN in order to be allowed to
monitor for one or more Restricted ProSe Application IDs.

6\. The ProSe Function in the HPLMN of the Monitoring UE sends an
authorization request to the ProSe Application Server. If, based on the
permission settings, the RPAUID is allowed to discover at least one of
the Target RPAUIDs contained in the Application Level Container, the
ProSe Application Server returns an authorization response.

7\. If the Discovery Request is authorized, and the PLMN ID in the
Target RPAUID indicates a different PLMN, the ProSe Function in the
HPLMN of the Monitoring UE contacts the indicated PLMN's ProSe Function
i.e. the ProSe Function in the HPLMN of the Announcing UE, by sending a
Monitor Request message.

8\. The ProSe Function in the HPLMN of the Monitoring UE may exchange
authorization messages with the ProSe Application Server.

9\. The ProSe Function in the HPLMN of the Announcing UE responds to the
ProSe Function in the HPLMN of the Monitoring UE with a Monitor Response
message including the ProSe Code, the corresponding Code-Receiving
Security Parameters (see subclause 6.1.3.4.3.3) and an optional
Discovery User Integrity Key (DUIK). The Code-Receiving Security
Parameters provide the information needed by the Monitoring UE to undo
the protection applied by the announcing UE. The DUIK shall be included
as a separate parameter if the Code-Receiving Security Parameters
indicate that the Monitoring UE shall use Match Reports for MIC
checking. The ProSe Function in the HPLMN of the Monitoring UE stores
the ProSe Code and the Discovery User Integrity Key (if it received one
outside of the Code-Receiving Security Parameters).

NOTE 1: There are two configurations possible for integrity checking,
namely, MIC checked by the ProSe Function, and MIC checked at the UE
side. Which of the configuration is used is decided by the ProSe
Function that assigned the ProSe Code being monitored, and signalled to
the Monitoring UE in the Code-Receiving Security Parameters.

10\. The ProSe Function in the HPLMN of the Monitoring UE returns the
Discovery Filter and the Code-Receiving Security Parameters, along with
the CURRENT\_TIME and MAX\_OFFSET parameters. The Monitoring UE takes
the same actions with CURRENT\_TIME and MAX\_OFFSET as described for the
Monitoring UE in step 9 of subclause 6.1.3.3.1 of the current
specification. The UE stores the Discovery Filter and Code-Receiving
Security Parameters.

Steps 11 and 12 occur over PC5.

11\. The UE starts announcing, if the UTC-based counter provided by the
system associated with the discovery slot is within the MAX\_OFFSET of
the announcing UE\'s ProSe clock and if the Validity Timer has not
expired. The UE forms the discovery message and protects it as described
in 6.1.3.4.3.2. The four least significant bits of UTC-based counter are
transmitted along with the protected discovery message.

12\. The Monitoring UE listens for a discovery message that satisfies
its Discovery Filter, if the UTC-based counter associated with that
discovery slot is within the MAX\_OFFSET of the monitoring UE\'s ProSe
clock. In order to find such a matching message, it processes the
message as described in 6.1.3.4.3.3. If the Monitoring UE was not asked
to send Match Reports for MIC checking, it stops at this step from a
security perspective. Otherwise it proceeds to step 13.

NOTE 2: The UE checking the integrity of the discovery message on its
own does not prevent the UE from sending a Match Report due to
requirements in TS 23. 303 \[2\]. If such a Match Report is sent, then
there is no security functionality involved.

Steps 13-16 refer to a Monitoring UE that has encountered a match.

13\. If the UE has either not had the ProSe Function check the MIC for
the discovered ProSe Code previously or the ProSe Function has checked a
MIC for the ProSe Code and the associated Match Report refresh timer
(see step 15 for details of this timer) has expired, then the Monitoring
UE sends a Match Report message to the ProSe Function in the HPLMN of
the monitoring UE. The Match Report contains the UTC-based counter value
with four least significant bits equal to four least significant bits
received along with discovery message and nearest to the monitoring UE's
UTC-based counter associated with the discovery slot where it heard the
announcement, and other discovery message parameters including the ProSe
Code and MIC. The ProSe Function checks the MIC.

14\. The ProSe Function in the HPLMN of the Monitoring UE may exchange
an Auth Req/Auth Resp with the ProSe App Server to ensure that
Monitoring UE is authorised to discover the Announcing UE.

15\. The ProSe Function in the HPLMN of the monitoring UE returns to the
Monitoring UE an acknowledgement that the integrity check passed. It
also provides the CURRENT\_TIME parameter, by which the UE (re)sets its
ProSe clock. The ProSe Function in the HPLMN of the Monitoring UE shall
include the Match Report refresh timer in the message to the Monitoring
UE. The Match Report refresh timer indicates how long the UE will wait
before sending a new Match Report for the ProSe Code.

16\. The Prose Function in the HPLMN of the Monitoring UE may send a
Match Report Info message to the ProSe Function in the HPLMN of the
Announcing UE.

###### 6.1.3.4.2.2 Model B security flows

This subclause contains the message flows for the protection of a model
B restricted discovery. The flows show how a particular discovery is
protected. The exact details of the actual protection to be applied to a
discovery message are given in subclause 6.1.3.4.3. The message flows
apply when both the UEs are roaming or when one or both are in their
HPLMN. If either of the UEs is not roaming some steps in the flows are
omitted as detailed in the flows.

The flows are broken down into 4 boxed stages to better to relate to the
procedures given in TS 23.303 \[2\]. The first, second and fourth stage
correspond to subclause 5.3.3A.3, 5.3.3A.5 and 5.3.4A.2 of TS 23.303
\[2\] respectively. The interaction between the ProSe Function(s) and
HSS is omitted for simplicity.

Figure 6.1.3.4.2.2-1: Flows for securing model B restricted discovery

Steps 1-4 refer to a Discoveree UE.

1\. Discoveree UE sends a Discovery Request message containing the
RPAUID to the ProSe Function in its HPLMN in order to get the ProSe Code
to announce and associated security material. The command indicates that
this is for ProSe Response (Model B) operation, i.e. for a Discoveree
UE.

2\. The ProSe Function may check for the announce authorization with the
ProSe Application Server depending on ProSe Function configuration.

3\. The ProSe Functions in the HPLMN and VPLMN of the Discoveree UE
exchange Announce Auth. messages. If the Discoveree UE is not roaming,
these steps do not take place.

4\. The ProSe Function in the HPLMN of the Discoveree UE returns the
ProSe Response Code and the Code-Sending Security Parameters, Discovery
Query Filter(s) and their Code-Receiving Security Parameters
corresponding to each discovery filter along with the CURRENT\_TIME and
MAX\_OFFSET parameters. The Code-Sending Security Parameters provide the
necessary information for the Discoveree UE to protect the transmission
of the ProSe Response Code (see subclause 6.1.3.4.3.2) and are stored
with the ProSe Response Code. The Code-Receiving Security Parameters
provide the information needed by the Discoveree UE to undo the
protection applied to the ProSe Query Code by the Discoverer UE (see
subclause 6.1.3.4.3.3). The Code-Receiving Security Parameters shall
indicate a Match Report will not be used for MIC checking. The UE stores
each Discovery Filter with its associated Code-Receiving Security
Parameters. The Discoveree UE takes the same actions with CURRENT\_TIME
and MAX\_OFFSET as described for the Announcing UE in step 4 of
subclause 6.1.3.3.1 of the current specification.

Steps 5-10 refer to a Discoverer UE

5\. The Discoverer UE sends a Discovery Request message containing the
RPAUID to the ProSe Function in its HPLMN in order to be allowed to
discover one or more Restricted ProSe Application IDs.

6\. The ProSe Function in the HPLMN of the Discoverer UE sends an
authorization request to the ProSe Application Server. If, based on the
permission settings, the RPAUID is allowed to discover at least one of
the Target RPAUIDs contained in the Application Level Container, the
ProSe Application Server returns an authorization response.

7\. If the Discovery Request is authorized, and the PLMN ID in the
Target RPAUID indicates a different PLMN, the ProSe Function in the
HPLMN of the Discoverer UE contacts the indicated PLMN's ProSe Function
i.e. the ProSe Function in the HPLMN of the Discoveree UE, by sending a
Discovery Request message.

8\. The ProSe Function in the HPLMN of the Discoveree UE may exchange
authorization messages with the ProSe Application Server.

9\. The ProSe Function in the HPLMN of the Discoveree UE responds to the
ProSe Function in the HPLMN of the Discoverer UE with a Discovery
Response message including the ProSe Query Code(s) and their associated
Code-Sending Security Parameters, ProSe Response Code and its associated
Code-Receiving Security Parameters (see subclause 6.1.3.4.3.3), and an
optional Discovery User Integrity Key (DUIK) for the ProSe Response
Code. The Code-Receiving Security Parameters provide the information
needed by the Discoverer UE to undo the protection applied by the
Discoveree UE. The DUIK shall be included as a separate parameter if the
Code-Receiving Security Parameters indicate that the Discoverer UE shall
use Match Reports for MIC checking. The ProSe Function in the HPLMN of
the Discoverer UE stores the ProSe Response Code and the Discovery User
Integrity Key (if it received one outside of the Code-Receiving Security
Parameters). The Code-Sending Security Parameters provide the
information needed by the Discoverer UE to protect the ProSe Query Code
(see subclause 6.1.3.4.3.2)

NOTE 1: There are two configurations possible for integrity checking,
namely, MIC checked by the ProSe Function, and MIC checked at the UE
side; this is decided by the ProSe Function that assigned the ProSe Code
being monitored, and signalled to the Monitoring UE in the
Code-Receiving Security Parameters.

10\. The ProSe Functions in the HPLMN and VPLMN of the Discoverer UE
exchange Announce Auth. messages. If the Discoverer UE is not roaming,
these steps do not take place.

11\. The ProSe Function in the HPLMN of the Discoverer UE returns the
Discovery Response Filter and the Code-Receiving Security Parameters,
the ProSe Query Code and the Code-Sending Security Parameters along with
the CURRENT\_TIME and MAX\_OFFSET parameters. The Discoverer UE takes
the same actions with CURRENT\_TIME and MAX\_OFFSET as described for the
Monitoring UE in step 9 of subclause 6.1.3.3.1 of the current
specification. The UE stores the Discovery Response Filter and its
Code-Receiving Security Parameters and the ProSe Query Code and its
Code-Sending Security Parameters.

Steps 12 to 14 occur over PC5.

12\. The Discoverer UE sends the ProSe Query Code and also listens for a
response message, if the UTC-based counter provided by the system
associated with the discovery slot is within the MAX\_OFFSET of the
announcing UE\'s ProSe clock and if the Validity Timer has not expired.
The Discoverer UE forms the discovery message and protects it as
described in 6.1.3.4.3.2. The four least significant bits of UTC-based
counter are transmitted along with the protected discovery message.

> 13a. The Discoveree UE listens for a discovery message that satisfies
> its Discovery Filter, if the UTC-based counter associated with that
> discovery slot is within the MAX\_OFFSET of the Discoverer UE\'s ProSe
> clock. In order to find such a matching message, it processes the
> message as described in 6.1.3.4.3.3.

NOTE 1a: Match Reports are not used for the MIC checking of ProSe Query
Codes.

13b. The Discoveree sends the ProSe Response Code associated with the
discovered ProSe Query Code. The Discoveree UE forms the discovery
message and protects it as described in 6.1.3.4.3.2. The four least
significant bits of UTC-based counter are transmitted along with the
protected discovery message.

14\. The Discoverer UE listens for a discovery message that satisfies
its Discovery Filter. In order to find such a matching message, it
processes the message as described in 6.1.3.4.3.3. If the Discoverer UE
was not asked to send Match Reports for MIC checking, it stops at this
step from a security perspective. Otherwise it proceeds to step 15.

NOTE 2: The UE checking the integrity of the discovery message on its
own does not prevent the UE from sending a Match Report due to
requirements in TS 23. 303 \[2\]. If such a Match Report is sent, then
there is no security functionality involved.

Steps 15-18 refer to a Discoverer UE that has encountered a match.

15\. If the Discoverer UE has either not had the ProSe Function check
the MIC for the discovered ProSe Response Code previously or the ProSe
Function has checked a MIC for the ProSe Response Code and the
associated Match Report refresh timer (see step 17 for details of this
timer) has expired, then the Discoverer UE sends a Match Report message
to the ProSe Function in the HPLMN of the Discoverer UE. The Match
Report contains the UTC-based counter value with four least significant
bits equal to four least significant bits received along with discovery
message and nearest to the monitoring UE's UTC-based counter associated
with the discovery slot where it heard the announcement, and other
discovery message parameters including the ProSe Response Code and MIC.
The ProSe Function checks the MIC.

16\. The ProSe Function in the HPLMN of the Discoverer UE may exchange
an Auth Req/Auth Resp with the ProSe App Server to ensure that
Discoverer UE is authorised to discover the Discoveree UE.

17\. The ProSe Function in the HPLMN of the Discoverer UE returns to the
Discoverer UE an acknowledgement that the integrity check passed. It
also provides the CURRENT\_TIME parameter, by which the UE (re)sets its
ProSe clock. The ProSe Function in the HPLMN of the Discoverer UE shall
include the Match Report refresh timer in the message to the Discoverer
UE. The Match Report refresh timer indicates how long the UE will wait
before sending a new Match Report for the ProSe Response Code.

18\. The Prose Function in the HPLMN of the Discoverer UE may send a
Match Report Info message to the ProSe Function in the HPLMN of the
Discoveree UE.

##### 6.1.3.4.3 Protection of the discovery messages over the PC5 interface

###### 6.1.3.4.3.1 General

There are three general types of security that are used to protect the
restricted discovery messages as they are transferred over the PC5
interface between the UEs.

Firstly, integrity protection is provided by appending a MIC as in Open
Discovery (see subclauses 6.1.3.3.1). The MIC is calculated in the
sending UE using a received Discovery User Integrity Key (DUIK) and may
either be checked at the receiving UE using the supplied DUIK or at the
ProSe Function using the DUIK.

Secondly, scrambling protection, which ensures that there is no
relationship between the discovery messages sent by a particular UE,
i.e. to prevent tracking of a UE over time. A scrambling keystream is
calculated from the Discovery User Scrambling Key (DUSK) and the
UTC-based counter associated with the discovery slot (see 6.1.3.4.3.5
for more details on the calculation).

Finally, message-specific confidentiality, which provides
confidentiality protection for part of the discovery message. This is
used either when several UEs use the same DUSK or if it is desired to
obfuscate part of the discovery message from some of the UEs that are
allowed to discover the UE. A keystream is calculated from the Discovery
User Confidentility Key (DUCK), the content of the message and the
UTC-based counter associated with the discovery slot (see 6.1.3.4.3.6
for more details on the calculation).

The security procedures that are applied at the sending and receiving UE
are controlled by the ProSe Function by sending the Code-Sending
Security Parameters and/or Code-Receiving Security Parameters to the
appropriate UE (i.e. the UE shall support all of integrity protection,
scrambling and message specific confidentiality) To achieve integrity
protection for a ProSe restricted discovery message, either a DUSK or a
DUIK needs to be provided. When a DUCK is used to apply message specific
confidentiality, a DUIK is required for integrity protection as more
than one message is being protected. Examples of combinations of
Discovery User Keys according to use case type is provided in Annex G..

At the receiving side, the scrambling protection must be undone before
any matching can be attempted. Given that the operation of undoing
message-specific confidentiality is computationally intense, the
matching operation that precedes it should have a very minimal chance of
a false positive. To this end, the ProSe Function should ensure the
number of bits in a discovery message that can be matched after any
scrambling has been undone is at least 16 (leading to a false positive
chance of 1 in 65,536 or less).

###### 6.1.3.4.3.2 Message Processing in the sending UE

The UE sending a discovery message receives the Code-Sending Security
Parameters from the ProSe Function (as described in the security flows)
to indicate how to protect the message. The Code-Sending Security
Parameters may contain a DUSK and may contain a DUIK. The Code-Sending
Security Parameters may contain both, a DUCK and an
Encrypted\_bits\_mask.

The UE sending a discovery message does the following steps:

1\. Form Discovery Message (e.g. add Suffix if only Prefix was
allocated).

2\. Calculate MIC if a DUIK was provided, otherwise set MIC to all zeros

3\. Add message-specific confidentiality to the message if DUCK was
received

4\. Append MIC to the output of step 3.

5\. Add scrambling over the output of step 4 if the DUSK was received.

###### 6.1.3.4.3.3 Protected message processing in the receiving UE

The Code-Receiving Security Parameters received from the ProSe Function
(as described in the security flows) are used to indicate to a UE how a
received discovery message is protected. The Code-Receiving Security
Parameters may contain a DUSK, may contain either a DUIK or an
indication whether to use Match Reports for MIC checking. The Match
Reports option is not allowed for ProSe Query Codes. The Code-Receiving
Security Parameters may also contain both a DUCK and a corresponding
Encrypted\_bits\_mask.

The UE receiving a Discovery Message does the following steps:

1\. Undo scrambling (as in step 5 of sending UE) if a DUSK was received.

2\. Check for match on the bits of the message that are not encrypted
using message specific confidentiality. If no match, then abort.

> NOTE 1: Some bits that the discovery filter indicates to be matched,
> may be encrypted by message-specific confidentiality at this stage.
> The UE can look for a match on the other bits after this step to
> minimise the amount of processing performed before finding a match.

3\. Undo message-specific confidentiality if a DUCK was received (as in
step 3 of sending UE)

4\. Check for full match if only a match on non-encrypted bits was found
in 3. If no match then abort

5\. If a MIC check is required, check MIC directly (if a DUIK was given
in the Discovery Filter Security Parameters) or via Match Report if
indicated in the Discovery Filter Security Parameters.

> NOTE 2: Requiring a checking of the MIC (at either the UE or via Match
> Reports) may only be omitted when the scrambling protection provides
> integrity protection of the bits of the message that are of interest
> to the receiving UE. Such integrity protection is only provided when
> (1) a given DUSK protects exactly one ProSe Code that the receiver
> matches, or (2) when message-specific confidentiality is applied to a
> ProSe Code but the receiving UE is not provided with the DUSK to
> remove the message-specific confidentiality and all the non-encrypted
> bits take a fixed value that the receiver matches. In the first case,
> if an attacker changes any bit of the message, the match will fail. In
> the second case, if an attacker changes a non-encrypted bit the match
> will fail and changing an encrypted does nothing as the receiving UE
> ignores these bits anyway. In latter case, the receiving UE could not
> successfully check the MIC.

###### 6.1.3.4.3.4 Integrity protection description 

The sending UE does the following

1\. Compute output bitsequence from DUIK, Message, and UTC-based counter
passed through a MIC calculation function in Annex A.2.

2\. Take the 4 bytes of the output of the function and set that as the
value of the MIC for this Message.

The receiving UE or ProSe Function does the exact same steps but also
does a comparison between the computed MIC and the received MIC.

###### 6.1.3.4.3.5 Scrambling description

The sending UE does the following:

1\. Set the 4 LSBs of the UTC-based counter equal zero, for the purpose
of this scrambling calculation only.

2\. Compute the time-hash-bitsequence from DUSK and the UTC-based
counter(modified as in step 1), passed through a keyed hash function.

3\. XOR the time-hash-bitsequence with the entire Discovery Message
(including MIC) being processed.

The receiving UE does the exact same steps except applied to the
received message being processed.

###### 6.1.3.4.3.6 Message-specific confidentiality description

The sending UE does the following:

1\. Compute *Key\_calc\_mask* = (*Encrypted\_bits\_mask* XOR 0xFF..FF)
\|\| 0xFFFFFFFF

2\. Calculate *Keystream* = KDF (DUCK, UTC-based counter,
(*Key\_calc\_mas*k AND (Message \|\| MIC))).

3\. XOR (*Keystream* AND *Encrypted\_bits\_mask*) into the Message.

The receiving UE does the exact same steps except applied to the
received Discovery Message being processed.

6.2 Security for One-to-many ProSe direct communication 
-------------------------------------------------------

### 6.2.1 Overview of One-to-many ProSe direct communication 

The One-to-many ProSe direct communication consists of the following
procedures based on TS 23.303 \[2\]:

1\. One-to-many ProSe Direct communication transmission;

2\. One-to-many ProSe Direct communication reception.

The functionality in this clause may only be supported by ProSe-enabled
Public Safety UEs.

Security for one-to-many ProSe direct communication consists of bearer
level security mechanism (specified in subclause 6.2.3).

### 6.2.2 Security requirements

The requirements in clause 5.3.2 apply for the signalling between the UE
and ProSe Function.

For the distribution of the keys, the following requirements apply:

\- The shared keys and session keys shall be protected in integrity and
confidentiality during their distribution.

\- Only authorized Public Safety ProSe-enabled UEs shall receive the
shared keys.

\- It shall be possible for the Public Safety ProSe-enabled UE to
authenticate the network entity distributing the shared keys.

\- The Public Safety ProSe-enabled UE should support authentication of
the group member distributing the session keys.

\- It shall be possible for the Public Safety ProSe-enabled UE to store
shared keys for past and future cryptoperiods.

\- The mechanism for distributing session keys shall support late entry
to group communications.

\- Authorized Public Safety Prose-enabled UEs shall securely store the
shared keys.

For the protection of the data transmission between the UEs, the
following requirements apply

\- The system shall support providing the Public Safety ProSe-enabled
UEs with the all the necessary keying material and chosen algorithms
that are used to protect the data sent between the Public Safety
ProSe-enabled UE(s). This material shall be provided without requiring
signalling between the Public Safety ProSe-enabled UEs.

\- Confidentiality of one-to-many communications should be supported.
Its use would be a configuration option related to network operations
and should hence be under control of the network operator.

\- Security mechanisms shall scale effectively to large groups, and be
compatible with rapid setup of group communications.

\- Security mechanism shall support multiple logical channels between
the same source/destination pair. Security mechanism shall avoid key
stream repetition (COUNTs is about to be re-used with the same key),
when multiple PDCP entities exist in the Public Safety ProSe-enabled UE.

### 6.2.3 Bearer layer security mechanism

#### 6.2.3.1 Security keys and their lifetimes

As part of the TLS protected signalling between the UE and ProSe Key
Management Function, a ProSe MIKEY Key (PMK) may be sent from the ProSe
Key Management Function to the UE. This key is used to protect the MIKEY
messages that are used to carry the PGKs to the UE. The usage of PMK to
protect the MIKEY messages is described in clause 6.2.3.3.2.3. The UE
keeps the PMK until it receives a new one from the ProSe Key Management
Function.

A UE needs to have an algorithm identity and a PGK (ProSe Group Key)
provisioned for each group that they belong to. From this key, a UE that
wishes to broadcast data shall first generate a PTK (ProSe Traffic Key).
The parameters used in this generation ensure that PTKs are unique for
each UE and need to be transferred in the header of the user data packet
(see below for more information). The PTK is derived when the first PDCP
entity for a group is created and then PDCP entities created further for
the same group shall use the PTK derived for the group.

From the PTK, a UE derives the needed ProSe Encryption Key (PEK) to be
able to encrypt the data. The UE can protect the data to be sent with
the relevant keys and algorithms at the bearer level (see clause 6.2.3.3
for more details).\
A receiving UE would need to derive the PTK using the information in the
bearer header and then the PEK used to decrypt the data.

When the PGKs are provided to the UE, they shall be provided with an
Expiry Time. The Expiry Time of the PGK needs to be set such that the
keys for later periods have a longer expiration period. Each PGK for
each group shall be associated with a different Expiry Time value.

When protecting data that is to be sent, the UE uses the PGK that has
not expired and with the earliest expiration time to derive the PTK etc,
for that group. When receiving protected data the UE shall only use a
PGK that has not expired or the PGK that has most recently expired. All
other expired PGK(s) should be deleted.

When a PGK key is deleted in the sending UE and receiving UE, all
related keys as PTK and PEK derived from the expired PGK shall be
deleted as well as the related PGK Identity, PTK Identity and Counter.
After releasing all the PDCP entities of a group, the PTK and PEK
derived for the group is deleted.

#### 6.2.3.2 Identities

The ProSe Key Management Function sends to the UE a PMK along with a 64
bit PMK identity. The UE uses both the PMK identity and the FQDN of the
ProSe Key Management Function to identify the PMKs locally (e.g.,
PMK\_id\@FQDN). The ProSe Key Management Function shall only allocate
currently (and locally) unused PMK identities.

The PGKs are specific to a particular group and hence have a Group
Identity associated with that group. This Group Identity is referred to
as \"ProSe Layer-2 Group ID\" in TS 23.303 \[2\] and is 24 bits long. In
addition, each PGK associated with a group has 8-bit PGK Identity to
identify it. This allows several PGKs for a group to be held
simultaneously as each can be uniquely identified. When allocating PGK
ID, the ProSe Key Management Function shall ensure that all allocated
PGKs that have not expired shall be uniquely identifiable by the 5 least
significant bits of the PGK ID. This means that the combination of Group
Identity and PGK Identity uniquely identifies a PGK. The Group Identity
is the destination Layer 2 identity of the group. An all zero PGK
Identity is used to signal special cases between the UE and ProSe Key
Management Function, and hence is never used to identify a PGK.

Each member of a group has a unique 24-bit Group Members Identity,
identifying a UE within a group and referred to as \"ProSe UE ID\" in TS
23.303 \[2\]. This is used a part of the PTK derivation to ensure each
user generates unique PTKs for protecting the data that they send. The
Group Members Identity is the source Layer 2 identity when the UE sends
data.

The PTK identity shall be a 16-bit counter set to a unique value in the
sending UE that has not been previously used together with the same PGK
and PGK identity in the UE. Every time a new PTK needs to be derived,
the PTK Identity counter is incremented.

A PTK is uniquely identified by the combination of Group Identity, PGK
Identity, Group Member Identity of the sending UE and a 16-bit PTK
identity. The PTK Identity is used as part of the derivation of PTK to
ensure that all PTKs are unique. Under a particular PGK, the PTK
identities are used in order starting with 1.

A Logical Channel ID (LCID) associated with the PDCP/RLC entity is used
as an input for ciphering in order to avoid key stream repetition (i.e.,
to avoid counter being re-used with the same PEK by one or more PDCP
entities corresponding to a group).

A 16 bit counter is maintained per PDCP entity. Counter and LCID ensures
key stream freshness across the transmission by multiple PDCP entities
of the same group. The counter is same as the PDCP SN in regular LTE.

For each group that the UE is a member of, the ME shall store a value of
PTK ID and counter in either the USIM or non-volatile memory on the ME
to prevent the re-use of the same values with a LCID under a PGK in case
the UE unexpectedly powers down. These stored values shall be associated
with the PGK that is being used to send the data.

After power on but before sending any one-to-many data for a group, the
ME shall handle the PTK ID and counter from the USIM or non-volatile
memory of the ME as follows. The ME shall copy the values PTK ID and
counter into volatile memory.

NOTE 1: The values stored in volatile memory represent the smallest
values of PTK ID and Counter that the UE knows have not been used with
currently unused LCIDs.

For USIM storage of PTK ID and counter, the ME shall also increase the
PTK ID in the USIM by 3 if it is less than 2\^16-4 or to 2\^16 -- 1
otherwise, and set the value of counter to 2\^16-1 (its maximum value).
If storage in non-volatile memory of the ME is used, the ME shall keep
the value of PTK ID in the non-volatile memory of the ME the same, and
set the counter to 2\^16-1.

NOTE 2: The PTK ID on the USIM is set higher than if it was held in
non-volatile memory of the ME to reduce the number of writes to the
USIM. It is not set to the maximal value in both cases as this would
invalidate a PGK for a possibly out of coverage UE.

When a new PDCP entity is created for sending traffic, the UE shall
select a currently unused LCID. If a previously unused PGK is to be used
to provide the keys for protecting this PDCP entity, then the UE acts as
below. Otherwise the ME selects a PTK Identity and counter values to use
with the new PDCP entity, such that no larger PTK ID has been used for
this PGK and LCID and no larger counter values have been used with this
PGK, PTK ID and LCID.

NOTE 3: It is enough for the ME to use the values stored in the volatile
memory of the ME to ensure keystream freshness, but more sophisticated
methods may allow more efficient use of PTK ID and counters.

If a previously unused PGK is to be used with the PDCP entity, then for
a PGK already stored on the USIM, the ME sets the PTK identity and
counter on the USIM to 3 and 2\^16-1 respectively and associates them
with this PGK. For a new PGK stored in non-volatile memory in the ME,
the ME shall set the PTK identity and counter in the non-volatile memory
of the ME to one and 2\^16-1 respectively and associates them with this
PGK. The ME shall set both the PTK ID and counter in volatile memory to
one. The ME shall use the new PGK, a PTK ID of one and a counter of one
to protect the traffic on the PDCP entity.

To encrypt the data for a PDCP entity, the ME shall calculate PTK (as
described in Annex A.3) and then PEK from PTK (as described in Annex
A.4). The ME then uses the PEK, LCID, PTK ID and counter to encrypt the
next data packet as described in subclause 6.2.3.6.1. Immediately after
encrypting the data packet, the ME shall increase the counter associated
with the PDCP entity by one. If this causes the counter to wrap, then
the ME shall behave as follows:

\- If PTK ID \< 2\^16-1, then the ME shall increase the PTK ID
associated with the PDCP entity by one and set the counter associated
with this PDCP entity to one. Furthermore for USIM storage of PTK ID,
the ME shall increase the PTK ID stored on the USIM by 3 if it is less
than 2\^16-4 or to 2\^16-1 otherwise if the stored PTK ID in USIM would
be less than the one about to be used in ME. If non-volatile memory on
the ME is used to store the PTK ID, the ME shall increase the PTK ID in
non-volatile memory by one.

\- If PTK ID = 2\^16-1 (i.e. PTK ID would wrap) and if the next PGK is
previously unused (i.e. does not have the PTK ID and Counter in either
the USIM or non-volatile memory of the ME associated with it), the ME
shall act as though it just created a new PDCP entity with a previously
unused PGK.

\- Otherwise (i.e. PTK ID = 2\^16-1 and the next PGK has already been
used in some other PDCP entity), the ME shall use the next PGK to
generate keys for this PDCP entity and set the PTK ID and counter
associated with this PDCP entity to one.

In all case of counter wrap, new PTK shall be derived from the PGK
taking the new PTK Identity into use. A new PEK shall be derived from
the new PTK as well. The old PTK associated with this PDCP entity shall
be deleted together with the corresponding old PEK derived from the old
PTK key.

When closing a PDCP entity, if the PGK being used by that PDCP context
is the most recently used one, the ME shall update the PTK ID and
counter values stored in the volatile memory of the ME as follows:

\- If the PTK ID in the PDCP entity is greater than the stored one, the
ME shall update the PTK ID and counter stored in volatile memory of the
ME to be the values from the PDCP entity;

\- If the PTK ID in the PDCP entity is equal to the stored one and the
counter values in the PDCP entity is greater than the stored one, the ME
shall update the counter in the volatile memory of the ME to the value
from the PDCP entity;

\- Otherwise, no changes are made to the values stored in the volatile
memory of the ME.

At power down, the UE first closes all its PDCP entities. Then for USIM
storage of the PTK ID, the ME shall set the PTK ID and counter values in
the USIM equal to those held in the volatile memory of the ME (i.e. the
values that would be used to protect the next packet). Otherwise the ME
shall set the PTK ID and counter values in the non-volatile memory equal
to those held in the volatile memory of the ME.

If the receiving UE receives a PDCP packet on a PDCP entity with a new
PTK Identity that has not been previously used with the same PGK and PGK
identity in the receiving UE, then the receiving UE shall delete any old
PTK for this PDCP entity and also delete the corresponding old PEK
derived from the old PTK.

#### 6.2.3.3 Security flows

##### 6.2.3.3.1 Overview

The protection of one-to-many communication proceeds as shown in the
figure below.

Figure 6.2.3.3-1: One-to-many security flows

0a or 0b: If needed the UE could be configured with any private keys,
associated certificates or root certificate that they may need for
contacting the ProSe Key Management Function to allow the keys to be
kept secret from the operator. If none are provided, then the USIM
credentials are used to protect that interface. The UE may also be
pre-configured with the address of the ProSe Key Management Function.

NOTE 1: The ProSe Key Management Function is shown as a separate logical
entity to allow the network operator to provision the radio level
parameters and a 3^rd^ party, e.g. public safety service, to have
control over provisioning the keys. If such a separation is not needed
then the ProSe Key Management Function may be deployed as part of the
ProSe Function

0c and 0d: The ProSe Function and ProSe Key Management Function need to
be configured with which subscriptions (either mobile subscriptions or
identities in certificates) are member of which groups.The ProSe Key
Management Function needs to pre-select an encryption algorithm for each
group based on a local policy.

1a or 1b: The UE fetches the one-to-many communication parameters from
the ProSe Function. As part of this procedure the UE gets its Group
Identity (see TS 23.303 \[2\]) and is informed whether bearer layer
security is needed for this group. In addition the UE may be provided
with the address of the ProSe Key Management Function that it uses for
obtaining keys for this group.

2a.i or 2b.i: The UE sends the Key Request message to the ProSe Key
Management Function including the Group Identity of the group for which
it wants to fetch keys and UE EPS security capabilities (including the
set of EPS encryption algorithms the UE supports).

2a.ii or 2b.ii: The ProSe Key Management Function checks whether the
group encryption algorithm is supported by the UE according to the UE
EPS security capabilities, i.e. whether the group encryption algorithm
is included in the set of EPS encryption algorithms the UE supports.

2a.iii or 2b.iii: The ProSe Key Management Function responds with the
Key Response message. If the check of step 2a.ii or 2b.ii is successful
for a particular group, this message contains the Group Member Identity
and the EPS encryption algorithm identifier that the UE should use when
sending or receiving protected data for this group. Otherwise, this
message contains an indicator of algorithm support failure as the UE
does not support the required algorithm. This message may also contain a
PMK and associated PMK ID if the ProSe Key Management Function decides
to use a new PMK.

2a.iv or 2b.iv: The ProSe Key Management Function sends the relevant
PGKs, PGK IDs and expiry time to the UE using MIKEY.

3a or 3b: The UE calculates the PTK and PEK to protect the traffic it
sends to the group. It does this by selecting the PGK as described in
subclause 6.2.3.1 and uses the next unused combination of PTK Identity
and Counter. It then protects the data using the algorithm given in step
2x.ii.

4a or 4b: A receiving UE gets the LC ID, Group Identity and Group Member
Identity from the layer 2 header. It then uses the received bits of the
PGK Identity to identify which PGK was used by the sender. The UE first
checks that the PGK is valid (see subclause 6.2.3.1) and if so
calculates the PTK and PEK to process the received message.

##### 6.2.3.3.2 Messages between UE and ProSe Key Management Function

###### 6.2.3.3.2.1 General

There are two types of messages that flow between the UE and ProSe Key
Management Function. Firstly, there are the Key Request and Response
messages. The UE uses these messages to request keys for particular
groups, while the ProSe Key Management Function uses these messages to
provide the UE with its group member identifier(s) and the security
algorithms to use with the various groups. Secondly, there are the MIKEY
messages, which the ProSe Key Management Function uses to send the PGKs
to the UE. These messages are detailed in the following subclauses.

###### 6.2.3.3.2.2 Key Request and Key Response messages

The purpose of these messages is for the UE to inform the ProSe Key
Management Function of the groups that the UE wishes to receive keys for
and the groups for which the UE no longer wishes to receive keys. The UE
knows which ProSe Key Management Function to contact for each group as
it is either pre-provisioned or provided by the ProSe Function. This is
the FQDN of the ProSe Key Management Function.

The UE shall not release the PDN connection used to receive MIKEY
messages containing PGKs until the UE has informed the ProSe Key
Management Function that it no longer requires PGKs. This is to ensure
that the ProSe Key Management Function is aware of the correct UE IP
address for the purpose of performing PGK deliveries as specified in
clause 6.2.3.3.2.3.

If the UE detects that a PDN connection, which is used for receiving
PGKs is released by the network, the UE should try to send a new Key
Request to inform the ProSe Key Management Function of its new IP
address. This is to ensure that the ProSe Key Management Function
becomes aware of the new UE IP address for the purpose of performing PGK
deliveries. Any new IP address should override any existing ones of the
UE at the ProSe Key Management Function.

Figure 6.2.3.3.2.2-1: Key Request/Key Response transaction

The protection for the Key Request and Key Response message is described
in subclause 6.2.3.5.

When sending a Key Request message to request the ProSe Key Management
Function to send PGKs or to change the groups for which it wants to
receive keys, the UE shall include the following information;

\- The indication of security algorithms that the UE supports for
one-to-many communications;

\- List of Group Identities for which the UE would like to receive keys;

\- For each Group Identity, the PGK IDs of any keys for that group. If
the UE holds no keys for this group, then it sends an all zero PGK ID;

\- List of Group Identities for which the UE would like to stop
receiving keys.

The ProSe Key Management Function shall check that the UE is authorised
to receive keys for the requested groups. This is done by using the UE
identity that is bound to the keys that established the TLS tunnel in
which the message is sent. It also checks that the UE supports the
confidentiality algorithm required for each group. If the UE doesn't
then the ProSe Key Management Function responds with the appropriate
error for that group. The ProSe Key Management Function shall update the
stored set of the groups for which the UE will be sent keys.

The ProSe Key Management Function responds to the UE with a Key Response
message that includes the following parameters:

\- List of the Group Identities that were included in the Key Request
message;

\- For each group that keys will be supplied for, the group member
identity and the security algorithm that should be used to protect the
data; and

\- For each of the other groups, a status code to indicate why keys will
not be supplied for that group.

\- An optional PMK and PMK Identity.

For the groups that the UE will get keys for, the UE shall store the
received information associated with that group identity. If a PMK and
PMK identity are included, the UE shall store these and delete any
previously stored ones for this ProSe Key Management Function.

The ProSe Key Management Function shall initiate the PGK delivery
procedures for the keys that are needed by the UE.

###### 6.2.3.3.2.3 MIKEY messages

####### 6.2.3.3.2.3.1 General

MIKEY is used to transport the PGKs from the ProSe Key Management
Function to the UE. MIKEY shall be used with pre-shared keys as
described in RFC 3830 \[13\]. The PMK shared by the ProSe Key Management
Function and the UE shall be used as the pre-shared secret. The UDP port
for MIKEY is 2269.

The ProSe Key Management Function may use the initial message to send
the PGK to the UE. Alternatively the ProSe Key Management Function may
use the initial MIKEY message (by setting the PGK\_ ID to all zeros) to
trigger a Key Request message from the UE. As part of this Key Request
Message, the ProSe Key Management Function may refresh the PMK used
between the UE and ProSe Key Management Function.

The response message is optional and only used if explicitly requested
in an initial message containing a PGK.

The replay protection of the MIKEY messages is provided by a 32-bit
counter that is associated with each PMK. It is initially set to zero
and is increased by one for every message sent. A received message is
discarded if the counter value is not greater than the largest
successfully received message.

####### 6.2.3.3.2.3.2 Creation of the MIKEY key delivery message

The initial MIKEY message is formed of the payloads which are filled as
follows:

**- MIKEY common header**: The CSB ID field of the MIKEY common header
id shall be set to a random number. If the ProSe Key Management Function
requires an acknowledgement of the PGK delivery message, then, it sets
the V-Bit to 1. The \#CS field shall be set to zero. The CS ID map type
subfield shall be set to \"Empty map\" as defined in RFC 4563 \[35\].

**- Timestamp payload**: The timestamp field shall be of type 2 and
contain the value of the replay counter that is associated with this
message.

**- MIKEY-RAND field**: The MIKEY-RAND field shall contain a 128-bit
random number that is chosen by the ProSe Key Management Function.

**- IDi payload**: The ID Type shall be set to the value 0 to indicate
an NAI with the identity formed from the Group Identity \|\| PGK ID @
FQDN of the ProSe Key Management Function.

**- IDr payload**: The ID Type shall be set to the value 0 to indicate
an NAI with the identity formed of the PMK identity of the PMK used to
protect the MIKEY message @ the FQDN of the ProSe Key Management
Function.

**- KEMAC Payload**: The Type Subfield shall be set to value 2. The use
of the NULL algorithm in MAC field is not allowed. The use of the NULL
alg in the Encr field is not allowed. The KV (Key Validity) subfield
shall be set to the value 2. The lower and upper limits of the validity
period of the PGK are expressed in unit of seconds and coded in binary
format as the 40 least significant bits of the Coordinated Universal
Time as defined in 3GPP TS 36.331 \[40\]. . In order to get the UE to
delete a PGK, the ProSe Management Function shall set the lower and
upper limits to be the same.

####### 6.2.3.3.2.3.3 Processing the MIKEY key delivery message

When a MIKEY message arrives at the ME, the processing process as
follows:

\- The UE shall extract PMK @ FQDN of the ProSe Key Management Function
for the IDr payload to establish which PMK was used to protect the MIKEY
message.

\- The Timestamp Payload is checked and compared against the stored
Counter for the PMK, and the message is rejected if that counter is not
larger then the current Counter.

\- The integrity of the message is checked. If this fails, the message
is discarded, otherwise the processing continues as follows.

\- The counter associated with the PMK shall be set to the values
conveyed in the Timestamp payload.

\- If the PMK used to protect the message is the not the last
successfully used one, then it becomes the last successfully used one
and any other PMK related to this ProSe Key Management Function is
deleted.

\- The UE shall extract the Group ID and PGK ID from the received IDi
Payload. If PGK ID is all zeros, then the UE shall stop processing the
message and send a Key Request message (as described in subclause
6.3.2.2.3.3).

\- The UE shall extract the PGK and Key Validity data from the KEMAC
payload as described in section 5 of RFC 3830 \[5\]. If the lower and
upper limits are the same, then the UE shall delete any key with the
Group ID and PGK ID contained in the MIKEY messages. Otherwise the UE
shall store the PGK along PGK ID and the validity limits.

####### 6.2.3.3.2.3.4 MIKEY Verification message

If the ProSe Key Management Function is expecting a response (i.e. set
the V-bit in the MIKEY common header to 1), then the UE shall respond
with a verification message. The verification message is made up of the
payloads which are filled as described:

**- MIKEY common header**: The CS ID is the same as in the MIKEY message
carrying the PGK. The \#CS field shall be set to zero. The CS ID map
type subfield shall be set to \"Empty map\" as defined in RFC 4563
\[35\].

**- Timestamp payload**: The timestamp field shall be of type 2 and
contain the value of the replay counter that is associated with this
message.

**- IDr payload**: The ID Type shall be set to the value 0 to indicate
an NAI with the identity formed of the PMK identity of the PMK used to
protect the MIKEY message @ the FQDN of the ProSe Key Management
Function.

**- Verification payload**: The use of the NULL algorithm in the MAC
field is not allowed. The MAC included in the verification payload shall
be calculated over both the initiator's and the responder's identities
as well as the timestamp in addition to over the response message as
defined in RFC 3830 \[13\].

#### 6.2.3.4 Protection of traffic between UE and ProSe Function

In order to protect the messages between the UE and ProSe Function, the
UE shall support the procedures for the UE given in subclause 5.3.3.2
and the ProSe Function shall support the procedures for the network
function given in subclause 5.3.3.

#### 6.2.3.5 Protection of traffic between UE and ProSe Key Management Function

In order to protect the UE-initiated messages between the UE and ProSe
Key Management Function, the UE shall support the procedures for the UE
given in subclause 5.3.3.2 and the ProSe Key Management Function shall
support the procedures for the network function given in subclause
5.3.3.2.

The MIKEY messages are protected as described in subclause 6.2.3.3.2.3.

#### 6.2.3.6 Protection of traffic between UEs

##### 6.2.3.6.1 Protection of data

ProSe enabled Public Safety UEs shall implement EEA0, 128-EEA1 and
128-EEA2 and may implement 128-EEA3 for ciphering one-to-many traffic.

The LTE ciphering algorithms (see TS 33.401 \[21\]) are used with the
following modifications;

\- Direction is always set to 0;

\- Bearer\[0\] to Bearer\[4\] are set to LCID;

\- COUNT\[0\] to COUNT\[15\] are set to PTK ID;

\- Counter is input into COUNT\[16\] to COUNT\[31\].

##### 6.2.3.6.2 Key derivation data in PDCP header

In terms of signalling between the UEs to transfer the relevant security
information, e.g. to indicate the correct PTK to use to calculate PEK,
the header of the PDCP packet for user plane data shall contain the 5
least significant bits of the PGK Identity, PTK Identity and Counter.
This is illustrated in figure 6.2.3.6.2-1.

Figure 6.2.3.6.2-1: Security aspects of the PDCP packet for user plane
data

NOTE: The Group Identity and Group Member Identity are carried in layers
below the PDCP layer.

If the network configuration is not to use confidentiality protection,
then the tramsmitting UE shall set the values of the security
information (PGK Identity, PTK Identity and Counter) to zero in the
header of the PDCP packet.

### 6.2.4 Solution description for media security of one-to-many communications

Media security for Mission Critical Push-To-Talk (MCPTT) is defined in
TS 33.179 \[43\]. The defined media security solution is designed to
support public-safety users when operating either on-network or
off-network (e.g. when using Proximity-based Services).

NOTE: The media security solution defined in TS 33.179 \[43\] is not
back compatible with the ProSe media security solution defined in Rel-12
in this clause.

6.3 EPC-level discovery of ProSe-enabled UEs
--------------------------------------------

### 6.3.1 Security for proximity request authentication and authorization

#### 6.3.1.1 General

The ProSe Function of two UEs may belong to different PLMNs and,
according to the current version of TS 23.303 \[2\], the application
server is the entity which discloses the EPUID of a particular target UE
to a ProSe Function so that it can request to the Prose Function
managing that target UE the sending of its location information for a
particular period of time.

The risk is that it would take just one Proximity Request from the UE
for the ProSe Function to actually keep a record of \[ALUID\_B,
EPUID\_B, PFID\_B\] mapping and have the capability to later send a
proximity request (step 4 of Proximity Request procedure in clause 5.5.5
of TS 23.303 \[2\]) although the UE didn\'t actually send a proximity
request at all (step 4 of Proximity Request procedure in clause 5.5.5 of
TS 23.303 \[2\]). This could lead to massive surveillance of users by
other PLMNs that may be very difficult to detect by the PLMN which
serves particular ProSe UEs.

Figure 6.3.1.1-1: extract from 3GPP TS 23.303 \[2\], Proximity request
procedure (clause 5.5.5)

#### 6.3.1.2 Application Server-signed proximity request

UE A doesn\'t sign the proximity request sent to its ProSe Function A,
but trusts the Application Server to control the authorization of the
proximity request sent on its behalf.

The authorization criteria can be based on detection mechanisms of very
high volume of incoming proximity requests from a ProSe Function that
doesn\'t match with the frequency usage of the ProSe Application by the
users, or it can be based on a presence detection mechanism over the PC1
interface.

ProSe Function A requests an authorization to the Application Server for
each proximity request it shall transmit over the PC2 interface. The
Application Server returns parameters which specify which operations are
authorized (e.g. authorized to send only one request, authorized to send
X requests until particular date, etc...).

ProSe Function B is assured of the authenticity of the proximity request
received from ProSe Function A by verifying the signature with a
verification key from the Application Server.

The token verification key is fetched over the PC2 interface between the
ProSe Function B and the Application Server.

The procedure below further defines the Proximity Request procedure in
clause 5.5.5 of TS 23.303 \[2\] to support authenticity of the request.

Figure 6.3.1.2-1: Application Server-signed Proximity Request

1\. Same as Step 1 of procedure in clause 5.5.5 of TS 23.303 \[2\]

2\. Same as Step 2 of procedure in clause 5.5.5 of TS 23.303 \[2\]

3\. The Application Server returns as part of the Map Response the
following additional data: the authorized operations (e.g. authorized to
send only one request, authorized to send X requests until particular
date, etc...), a timestamp, the signature AS\_signature of the
cryptographic hash of the concatenation of the EPUID\_A, the ALUID\_A,
the ALUID\_B, the authorized operations and the timestamp value, and
optionally the associated certificate CertKey\_AS of Application
Server\'s verification key.

4\. ProSe Function A sends as part of the Proximity Request to ProSe
Function B the following additional data: the AS\_signature, ALUID\_A,
ALUID\_B, the timestamp, the authorized operations, the Application ID
and optionally the CertKey\_AS\'s certificate.

4a . If the CertKey\_AS\'s certificate wasn\'t part of the Proximity
request, or that either the CertKey\_AS\'s certificate or verification
key wasn\'t stored in internal memory, then ProSe Function B sends a
Verification Key fetching requests to Application Server\'s verification
key (identifiable with the Application ID).

4b . The Application Server returns the verification key.

4c . If the verification of signature from the Application Server is
successful then the procedure continues the procedure from step 5 in
clause 5.5.5 of TS 23.303 \[2\].

#### 6.3.1.3 Proximity request digital signature algorithms and key strength

The cryptographic length of the signing asymmetric keys shall have at
least a key strength equivalent to a 128-bits symmetric key. The
following digital signature algorithms may be used:

RSA as specified in FIPS 186-4 \[15\]: the minimum key length shall be
3072 bits. The minimal size for the hash function shall at least be
SHA-256 which shall be used as specified by NIST \[20\].

DSA as specified in FIPS 186-4 \[15\]: the minimum key length shall be
256 bits.

ECDSA as specified in BSI TR-03111 \[16\]: the minimum key length shall
be 256 bits, the elliptic curve domain parameters shall be selected
among those available in RFC 5639 \[17\]. The corresponding hash
function shall be chosen depending on the previously selected elliptic
curve domain parameters (cf. clause 5 in RFC 5639 \[17\]).

#### 6.3.1.4 Proximity request hash input format

The input to the hash function shall be encoded as specified in Annex
B.1 of TS 33.220 \[5\] and shall consist of the concatenation of
proximity request parameters and their respective lengths:

FC = 0x00

P0 = EPUID\_A

L0 = Length of P0 value

P1 = ALUID\_A

L1 = Length of P1 value

P2 = ALUID\_B

L2 = Length of P2 value

P3 = Timestamp. It shall use the date-time format as defined in clause
5.6 of RFC 3339 \[18\] and shall be encoded according to Annex B.2.1.2
of TS 33.220 \[5\]

L3 = Length of P3 value

P4 = Authorized operations

L4 = Length of P4 value

NOTE: The key derivation function defined in Annex B.1 of TS 33.220
\[5\] is not used, therefore the FC value should only be considered as a
dummy value.

#### 6.3.1.5 Verification key format

The following shall be supported by the Application Server and the ProSe
Function:

The verification key shall be formatted like the \"Subject Public Key
Info\" element of a X.509 certificate.\
The \"Subject Public Key Info\" is specified in clause 4.1.2.7 of RFC
5280 \[19\].\
RFC 5639 \[17\] shall also be supported in order to include ECDSA with
Brainpool elliptic curve domain parameters.

#### 6.3.1.6 Profile for Application Server certificate

The following may be supported by the Application Server and the ProSe
Function:

Certificates used for authentication of the Proximity Request shall meet
the certificate profiles given in TS 33.310 \[4\] as follows:

\- clause 6.1.3, for SEG certificates, shall apply to ALUID-associated
certificates, and

\- clause 6.1.4, for SEG CA certificates, shall apply to any CA
certificates used in a chain to validate the certificates, with the
following additions and exceptions:

\- Mandatory critical key usage: only digitalSignature shall be set.

### 6.3.2 Protection of traffic between UE and ProSe Function

In order to protect the messages between the UE and ProSe Function, the
UE shall support the procedures for the UE given in subclause 5.3.3.2
and the ProSe Function shall support the procedures for the network
function given in subclause 5.3.3.2.

6.4 Security for EPC support WLAN direct discovery and communication
--------------------------------------------------------------------

For EPC support for WLAN Direct Discovery, the security mechanisms as
defined for EPC-level ProSe Discovery (clause 6.3) apply.

For EPC support for WLAN Direct communication, based on the UEs WLAN
security capabilities the ProSe Function may provide only such WLAN
security parameters to the ProSe-enabled UEs that ensure confidentiality
and integrity of the ProSe-assisted WLAN direct communication path to a
level comparable with that provided by the existing 3GPP system.

NOTE: Release 12 does not provide stage 3 specification.

6.5 Security for One-to-one ProSe Direct communication 
------------------------------------------------------

### 6.5.1 General 

The one-to-one ProSe Direct communication procedures are described in TS
23.303 \[2\]. One-to-one ProSe Direct Communication is used by two UEs
that want to directly exchange traffic or when a remote UE attaches to a
ProSe UE-to-network relay.

Security requirements are summarised in section 6.5.2. An overview of
one-to-one ProSe Direct Communication is given in section 6.5.3. The
authentication and key establishment procedures for the basic one-to-one
communications are described in section 6.5.4. In section 6.5.5 the
general security establishment that is used in all use cases is
described.

The functionality in this clause may only be supported by ProSe-enabled
Public Safety UEs.

### 6.5.2 Security Requirements

The following are the security requirements for ProSe Direct One-to-one
Communication:

A ProSe-enabled UE shall use different security contexts for ProSe
one-to-one communication with different ProSe-enabled UEs.

Direct link signalling ciphering shall be supported and may be used.
Direct link signalling ciphering is a configuration option.

Direct link user plane ciphering shall be supported and may be used.

Direct link signalling integrity protection and replay protection shall
be supported and used.

Direct link user plane packets between UEs shall not be integrity
protected.

Establishment of the security between the UEs shall be protected from
man-in-the-middle attacks.

The system should support mutual authentication of public safety UEs out
of network coverage.

Compromise of a single UE should not affect the security of the others.

Authentication credentials should be securely stored in UE.

### 6.5.3 Overview of One-to-one ProSe Direct communication

#### 6.5.3.1 Description of differet layers of keys and their identities

ProSe Direct One-to-one communication uses 4 different layers of keys.
These are the following:

Long term key: This is the key that is provisioned (see the individual
cases in 6.5.4 for more information on the provisioning) into the UE and
is the root of the security for one-to-one communications. It may be a
symmetric key or public/private key pair depending on the particular use
case. Authentication signalling (denoted as "Direct Authentication and
Key Establishment" - see subclause 6.5.4) is exchanged between the UEs
and possibly some entities in the network, for example in the ProSe
UE-to-network relay case to derive the K~D~. The long term key is
identified by the Long term ID.

K~D~: This is a 256-bit root key that is shared between the two entities
communicating using ProSe Direct one-to-one communications. It may be
refreshed by re-running the authentication signalling using the Long
term key. In order to generate a K~D-sess~ (the next layer of keys),
nonces are exchanged between the communicating entities. K~D~ may be
kept even when the UEs have no active one-to-one communication session
between them. The K~D~ ID is used to identify K~D.~

K~D-sess~: This is the 256-bit key that is the root of the actual
security context that is being used (or at least in the process of being
established) to protect the transfer of data between the UEs. During a
communication between the UEs, the K~D-sess~ may be refreshed by running
the rekeying procedure (see subclause 6.X.5.3). The actual keys (see
next bullet) that are used in the confidentiality and integrity
algorithms are derived directly from K~D-sess~. The 16 bit K~D-sess~ ID
identifies the K~D-sess~.

A K~D-sess~ ID with a zero value indicates no security is used and hence
the UEs shall not assign an all zero value of K~D-sess~ ID when creating
a security context.

PEK and PIK: The ProSe Encryption Key (PEK) and ProSe Integrity Key
(PIK) are used in the chosen confidentiality and integrity algorithms
respectively. They are derived from K~D-sess~ and are refreshed
automatically every time K~D-sess~ is changed.

#### 6.5.3.2 Security states

A UE may be in one of the three different security states with respect
to another UE as follows:

Provisioned-security: This is where a UE just has its own long term
keys.

Partial-security: This is where a UE has recently communicated with
another UE and still has the K~D~ that it used with the other UE, but no
other derived keys.

Full-security: This is where a UE is actually communicating with another
UE and has K~D~, K~D-sess~, PEK and PIK, the chosen confidentiality and
integrity algorithms and PDCP counters used with each bearer.

Once a UE ends its communication session with another UE, it shall
delete K~D-sess~, PEK and PIK, the choice of algorithms and the
counters. It may also delete K~D~.

#### 6.5.3.3 High level overview of security establishment

Figure 6.5.3.3-1: Overview of security establishment of ProSe Direct
One-to-one communications

Figure 6.5.3.3-1 provides a high level overview of security
establishment. In this flow, authentication and key establishment
happens during steps 1 to 3 with the requirement that UE\_2 must know
K~D~ at the end of step 2. Step 2 may involve several messages, and
these messages depend on the type of Long term key(s). More details on
this are provided in subclause 6.5.4. The actual establishment of a
security context happens during steps 1, 3 and 4. More details on this
are provided in subclause 6.5.5.

The integrity and confidentiality protection is applied at the PDCP
layer. The details of this are given in subclause 6.5.6.

### 6. 5.4 Direct Authentication and Key Establishment

#### 6.5.4.1 General

There are various methods that ProSe Direct one-to-one communications
may use to provide authentication and establishment of K~D~. These
methods may vary from case to case and the description of any necessary
Direct Authentication and Key Establishment signalling that is needed in
addition to the Direct Security Mode Command and Complete message will
be covered with each specific case.

NOTE: None of the cases included in this release require any Direct
Authentication and Key Establishment signalling.

### 6.5.5 Security Establishment procedures

#### 6.5.5.1 General

There are two different cases when a security context may be
established; to set up a new connection and to re-key an ongoing
connection. These cases are described in the following subclauses.

#### 6.5.5.2 Security establishment during connection set-up

The subclause describes how security is established during connection
set-up. The signalling flow is shown in figure 6.5.5.2-1.

Figure 6.5.5.2-1: Security establishment at connection set-up

1\. UE\_1 has sent a Direct Communication Request to UE\_2. This message
shall include Nonce\_1 (for session key generation), UE\_1 security
capabilities (the list of algorithms that UE\_1 will accept for this
connection) and the most significant 8-bits of the K~D-sess\ ID~. These
bits shall be chosen such that UE\_1 will be able to locally identify a
security context that is created by this procedure. The message may also
include a K~D~ ID if the UE\_1 has an exisiting K~D~ with the UE that it
trying to communicate with. The absence of the K~D~ ID parameter
indicates that UE\_1 does not have a K~D~ for UE\_2. The message shall
also contain the necessary information to establish a K~D~ from the
revelvant long terms keys held on the UE (see subclause 6.X.4). Long
term ID is the info needed by the UE\_2 in order to retrieve the right
Long term Key.

2\. UE\_2 may initiate a Direct Auth and Key Establish procedure with
UE\_1. This is mandatory if the UE\_2 does not have the K~D~ and K~D~ ID
pair indicated in step 1, and signalling is needed to establish the keys
for the particular use case.

3\. UE\_2 sends the Direct Security Mode Command to UE\_1. It shall
include the most significant bits of K~D~ ID if a fresh K~D~ is
generated, Nonce\_2 to allow a session key to be calculated and the
Chosen\_algs parameter to indicate which security algorithms the UEs
will use to protect the data. The included bits of K~D~ ID shall
uniquely identify the K~D~ at UE\_2. UE\_2 shall also return the UE\_1
security capabilities to provide protection against bidding down
attacks. UE\_2 also includes the least significant 8-bits of K~D-sess~
ID in the messages. This bits are chosen so that UE\_2 will be able to
locally identify a security context that is created by this procedure.
UE\_2 calculates K~D-Sess~ from K~D~ and Nonce\_1 and Nonce\_2 (see
Annex A.9) and then derives the confidentiality and integrity keys based
on the chosen algorithms (Annex A.4).

> UE\_2 then integrity protects the Direct Security Mode Command before
> sending it to UE\_1. UE\_2 is then ready to receive both signalling
> and user plane traffic protected with the new security context. UE\_2
> shall form the K~D-sess~ ID from the most significant bits it received
> in message 1 and least significant bits it sent in message 3.

4\. On receieving the Direct Security Mode Command, UE\_1 shall
calculate K~D-sess~ and the confidentiality and integrity keys in the
same way as UE\_2. UE\_1 shall check that the returned UE\_1 security
capabilities are the same as those it sent in step 1. UE\_1 shall also
check the integrity protection on the message. If both these checks
pass, then UE\_1 is ready to send and receive signalling and user
traffic with the new security context. If most significant bits of K~D~
ID were included in the Direct Security Mode Command, UE\_1 shall
generate the least significant bits of K~D~ ID such that these bits
uniquely identify K~D~ at UE\_1 and shall store the complete K~D~ ID
with K~D~. UE\_1 shall send an integrity protected and confidentiality
protected (with the chosen algorithm which may be the null algorithm)
Direct Security Mode Complete message to UE\_2. UE\_1 shall include the
least significant bits of K~D~ ID in this message. UE\_1 shall form the
K~D-sess~ ID from the most significant bits it sent in message 1 and
least significant bits it received in message 3.

5\. UE\_2 checks the integrity protection on the received Direct
Security Mode Complete. If this passes, UE\_2 is now ready to send user
plane data and control signalling protected with the new security
context. UE\_2 deletes any old security context it has for UE\_1. UE\_2
shall form the K~D~ ID from the most significant bits it sent in step 3
and least significant bits it received in the Direct Security Mode
Complete.UE\_2 shall store the complete K~D~ ID with K~D~.

#### 6.5.5.3 Rekeying security

By rekeying, the UEs ensure fresh session keys K~D\_sess~ are used.
Optionally the rekeying can also enforce refresh of K~D~. Either UE may
rekey the connection at any time. This shall be done before the counter
for a particular LCID repeats with the current keys. A rekeying
operation shall refresh the K~D-sess~ and PEK and PIK, and may refresh
K~D~. A rekeying operation follows the flows given in figure 6.5.5.3-1.

NOTE 1: The UE that initiates a rekeying does not need to be the same
one that iniated the connection set-up.

Figure 6.5.5.3-1: Security establishment during rekeying

1\. UE\_1 sends a Direct Rekey Request to UE\_2. This message shall
include Nonce\_1 (for session key generation), UE\_1 security
capabilities (the list of algorithms that UE\_1 will accept for this
connection) and the most significant 8-bits of the K~D-sess\ ID~. These
bits are chosen such that UE\_1 will be able to locally identify a
security context that is created by this procedure. The message may also
include a Re-auth Flag, if UE\_1 wants to rekey K~D~. The message shall
also contain the necessary information to establish a K~D~ from the
relevant long terms keys held on the UE (see subclause 6.5.4).

2\. UE\_2 may initiate a Direct Auth Key Establish procedure with UE\_1.
This is mandatory if UE\_1 included the Re-auth Flag and signalling is
needed to establish K~D.~

3\. This step is the same as step 3 in 6.5.5.2 except the most
significant bits of K~D~ ID are included if a fresh K~D~ is generated
during this rekeying.

4\. This step is the same as step 4 in 6.5.5.2.

5\. This step is the same as step 5 in 6.5.5.2.

6\. When UE\_1 receives a message integrity protected with the new
security context, it shall delete any old security context is has still
stored for UE\_2.

### 6.5.6 Protection of the one-to-one traffic

#### 6.5.6.1 General

Protection for the signalling and user plane databetween the UEs is
provided at the PDCP layer. As the security is not preserved through a
drop of the connection, all signalling messages that need to be sent
before security is established, may be sent with no protection.

Editor's note: This exact message that may be sent without protection
are FFS.

All other signalling messages shall be integrity protected and may be
confidentiality protected except the Direct Security Mode Command which
is sent integrity protected only.

The bearer with LCID = 28 shall be used to carry signalling messages
that are not protected.

The bearer with LCID = 29 shall be used for Direct Security Mode Command
and Direct Security Mode Complete.

The bearer with LCID = 30 shall be used for other signalling messages
that are confidentiality and integrity protected.

The bearer with LCID = 1 to 10 may be used for user plane traffic with
confidentiality protection.

#### 6.5.6.2 Integrity protection

ProSe enabled Public Safety UEs shall implement 128-EIA1 and 128-EIA2
and may implement 128-EIA3 for integrity protection of one-to-one direct
link signalling.

The LTE integrity algorithms (see TS 33.401 \[21\]) are used with the
following modifications;

\- The key used is PIK;

\- Direction is set to 1 for direct link signalling transmitted by the
UE that sent the Direct Security Mode Command for this security context
and 0 otherwise;

\- Bearer\[0\] to Bearer\[4\] are set to LCID;

\- COUNT\[0\] to COUNT\[15\] are set to K~D-sess~ ID;

\- Counter is input into COUNT\[16\] to COUNT\[31\].

The receiving UE shall ensure that received messages are not replayed.

#### 6.5.6.3 Confidentiality protection

ProSe enabled Public Safety UEs shall implement EEA0, 128-EEA1 and
128-EEA2 and may implement 128-EEA3 for ciphering of one-to-one traffic.

The LTE ciphering algorithms (see TS 33.401 \[21\]) are used with the
following modifications;

\- The key used in PEK;

\- Direction is set as for integrity protection (see 6.5.6.2);

\- Bearer\[0\] to Bearer\[4\] are set to LCID;

\- COUNT\[0\] to COUNT\[15\] are set to K~D-sess~ ID;

\- Counter is input into COUNT\[16\] to COUNT\[31\].

#### 6.5.6.4 Security contents in the PCDP header

The 16-bit K~D-sess~ ID and 16-bit Counter parameters are carried in the
PDCP header, along with any MAC that is needed for integrity protection.
This is illustrated in the Figure 6.5.6.4-1.

Figure 6.5.6.4-1: Security contexts of the PDCP header for one-to-one
communications

If the configuration is not to use confidentiality protection for
one-to-one communication user plane, then the UE shall set the values of
the security information (K~D-sess~ ID and Counter) to zero in the
header of the user plane PDCP packets.

For the signalling messages that are not protected, the K~D-sess~ and
Counter in PDCP format are set to zeros in the header of the PDCP
packet.

### 6.5.7 ProSe one-to-one commuication security using ECCSI and SAKKE

#### 6.5.7.1 General

The solution uses the \"Elliptic Curve-based Certificateless Signatures
for Identity-based Encryption\" (ECCSI) signature scheme, as defined in
RFC 6507 \[14\]. And, Sakai-Kasahara Key Encryption (SAKKE), as defined
in RFC 6508 \[24\] to generate a shared secret that is used as a K~D~
(root key) for establishing a secure connection between the two UEs.

#### 6.5.7.2 Key and their identities

The UEs are provisioned with the required credentials (as defined in RFC
6507 \[14\] and RFC 6508\[24) in advance, when the UEs have a secure
access to their Key ManagementServer (KMS).

The KMS, common root of trust for the UEs, provisions the UEs with a set
of credentials for ECCSI and SAKKE schemes.

Upon successful provisioning for ECCSI, each UE will be configured with
the public key of the KMS, and a set of credentials associated with the
UE's identity, which are: Secret Signing Key (SSK) and Public Validation
Token (PVT). The UE must act as \"signer\" and \"verifier\". As a
signer, the UE uses its SSK to sign a message, and when acting as a
verifier, the UE uses the public key of the KMS and the signer's PVT to
verify the signature.

Upon successful provisioning for SAKKE, each UE will be configured with
the public key of the KMS, and a Receiver Secret Key (RSK) which is
associated with the UE's identity. The sender UE uses the receiver's UE
identity (receiving entity for SAKKE payload) and the public key of the
KMS to create an encrypted SAKKE payload. The receiving UE uses its
identity, its Receiver Secret Key and the public key of the KMS to
decrypt SAKKE payload.

The public identity of a UE may be encoded in any format that is
compatible with the guidelines provided in RFC 6509 \[12\]. For example,
the public identity of a UE may be a concatenation of a fixed part (in
the form of IMSI, SIP URI, TEL URI, other user\@domain types of URI,
etc.) and a varying part (in the form of a timestamp).

### 6.5.7.3 Security flows

#### 6.5.7.3.1 Direct Connection Request

Figure 6.5.7.3.1-1 illustrates the establishment of a secure one-to-one
ProSe Direct communication. It relies on the generic signalling set that
is described in subclause6.5.5. The figure only includes the additional
information in the messages.

Figure 6.5.7.3.1-1: Security establishment at connection setup

1\. UE-1 wishing to engage in one-to-one ProSe Direct Communication with
UE-2 sends a Direct Communication Request message including the
following parameters:

\- User of UE-1 Info = upper layer information identifying the user of
UE-1. This information is used to derive the Signer's identifier (used
by ECCSI).

\- SIGN -- an ECCSI signature (as defined in RFC 6507 \[14\]) of the
Direct Communication Request message. The signature is computed over the
User of UE-1 Info parameters and the Nonce 1 (see subclause 6.5.5).

Editor's note: The exact format of input parameters to calculation of
the signature is FFS

2\. Upon reception of the Direct Communication Request message, UE-2
verifies the signature payload SIGN. If the verification test is
successful, UE-2 presents the authenticated identity ("User of UE-1
Info") to the user of UE-2. If user of UE-2 decides to accept the
request, UE-2 sends a Direct Security Mode Command message including the
following parameters:

\- User of UE-2 Info = upper layer information identifying the user of
UE-2. This information is used to derive the Signer's identifier (used
by ECCSI).

\- SIGN -- an ECCSI signature (as defined in RFC 6507 \[14\]) of the
Direct Communication Response message. The signature is computed over
the User of UE-2 Info, Nonce 1 and the SAKKE parameters.

Editor's note: The exact parameters of input parameters to calculation
of the signature is FFS

SAKKE -- UE-2 generates a 256-bit key Shared Secret Value (SSV), which
is used as K~D~ (root key), and encodes SSV value into a SAKKE payload
according to the algorithm described in RFC 6508 \[24\], using the KMS
Pubic Key and the public identity of the user of UE-1.

Upon receipt of the Direct Security Mode message, the UE-1 verifies the
signature payload SIGN. If the verification test is successful, it
decrypts SAKKE payload to extract the SSV which is used as a K~D~ (root
key) from which other keys can be derived.

3\. Upon successful processing of the Direct Security Mode Command
message, UE-1 responds with a Direct Security Mode Complete.

Both UEs shall store their own and the other UE's User Info with the
K~D~.

##### 6.5.7.3.2 Direct Rekeying Request

Figure 6.5.7.3.2-1 illustrates rekeying of an existing secure connection
when K~D~ is changed. It relies on the generic signalling set that is
described in subclauses 6.5.5 over an existing secure connection. The
figure only includes the additional information in the messages. When
K~D~ is not changed the rekeying proceeds exactly as described in
subclause 6.5.5.3.

Figure 6.5.7.3.2-1: Security establishment when rekeying an existing
connection

1\. UE-1 send a Direct Rekeying Request to UE-2.

2\. UE-2 responds with a Direct Security Mode Command message including
the following parameters:

\- SIGN -- an ECCSI signature (as defined in RFC 6507 \[14\]) of the
Direct Communication Response message. The signature is computed over
the User of UE-2 Info, Nonce 1 and the SAKKE parameters.

Editor's note: The exact parameters of input parameters to calculation
of the signature is FFS

SAKKE -- UE-2 generates a 256-bit key Shared Secret Value (SSV), which
is used as K~D~ (root key), and encodes SSV value into a SAKKE payload
according to the algorithm described in RFC 6508 \[24\], using the KMS
Pubic Key and the public identity of the user of UE-1.

Upon receipt of the Direct Security Mode message, the UE-1 verifies the
signature payload SIGN. If the verification test is successful, it
decrypts SAKKE payload to extract the SSV which is used as a K~D~ (root
key) from which other keys can be derived.

3\. Upon successful processing of the Direct Security Mode Command
message, UE-1 responds with a Direct Security Mode Complete.

Both UEs shall store their own and the other UE's User Info with the
K~D~.

6.6 Security for ProSe Public Safety Discovery 
----------------------------------------------

### 6.6.1 General 

The ProSe Public Saftey Discovery procedures are described in TS 23.303
\[2\]. This clause details the security procedures for ProSe Public
Safety Discovery.

The functionality in this clause may only be supported by ProSe-enabled
Public Safety UEs.

### 6.6.2 Security Requirements

The requirements in clause 5.3.2 apply for the signalling between the UE
and ProSe Function.

For the distribution of the keys used to protect the discovery message,
the following requirements apply:

\- The keys shall be protected in integrity and confidentiality during
their distribution.

\- Only authorized Public Safety ProSe-enabled UEs shall receive the
keys.

\- It shall be possible for the Public Safety ProSe-enabled UE to
authenticate the network entity distributing the keys.

\- It shall be possible for the Public Safety ProSe-enabled UE to store
shared keys for past and future cryptoperiods.

\- Authorized Public Safety Prose-enabled UEs shall securely store the
shared keys.For the discovery messages over the PC5 interface, the
following security requirements apply:

\- The system shall support a method to mitigate the replay attack,
source authenticity verification and integrity protection of public
safety discovery messages.

\- The system should provide a means of minimising the possibility of
tracking of UEs based on the content of their discovery messages over
time.

\- The system shall support the confidentiality of information added to
the messages.

### 6.6.3 Overview of ProSe Public Safety Discovery

#### 6.6.3.1 General

There are two types of ProSe Public Safety Discovery described in TS
23.303 \[2\]: Relay Discovery (including the additonal Discovery
messages) and Group Member Discovery. The security measures for both of
these are identical and are reusing the following aspects:

\- the key provisioning mechanism that ProSe one-to-many commuication
uses, whereby a root key is fetched (the PGK -- see subclause 6.2.3.1 of
the present specification) along with associated security information;
and

> \- the mechanisms defined for restricted discovery in terms of
> protecting the discovery messages over the air (see subclause
> 6.1.3.4.3 of the present specification with the needed DUIK, DUCK and
> DUSKs derived from the root key). It is optional to support scrambling
> for Public Safety Discovery.

Like open and restricted discovery, ProSe Public Safety Discovery also
uses a UTC-based counter (see step 9 in clause 6.1.3.3) to provide
freshness for the protection of the restricted discovery message on the
PC5 interface. The parameters CURRENT\_TIME and MAX\_OFFSET are also
provided to the UE from the PKMF to ensure that the obtained UTC-based
counter is sufficiently close to real time to protect against replays.

#### 6.6.3.2 Key and their identities

The Public Safety Discovery Key (PSDK) is the root key that is used for
the protection of the Pubic Safet Discovery messages. It is identified
by an 8-bit PSDK ID and each PSDK is assocciated with one or more Relay
Service Codes and/or Discovery Group IDs. This association is achieved
by allocating a 24-bit Key Type ID to the Relay Service Codes (RSCs) and
Discovery Group IDs during the Key Request/Key Response procedure. The
Key Type ID is also included in the MIKEY message, so a delivered PSDK
can be associated with the correct RSCs and/or Discovery Group IDs.

NOTE: The allocation of RSC and/or Discovery Group ID to a particular
Key Type ID is specific to a UE and does not need to be common across
all UEs.

When the PSDKs are provided to the UE, they shall be provided with an
Expiry Time. The Expiry Time of the PSDK needs to be set such that the
keys for later periods have a longer expiration period. Each PSDKs for
each Key Type ID shall be associated with a different Expiry Time value.

All expired PSDK, except the most recently expired of the PSDK(s),
should be deleted.

Public Safety discovery also uses the PMK and PMK ID for the MIKEY
messages as described in subclauses 6.2.3.1 and 6.2.3.2 of the present
specification.

### 6.6.4 Security flows

#### 6.6.4.1 Overview

The configuration of the security material for the protection of direct
discovery messages is shown in the figure 6.6.4.1-1:

![](media/image17.png){width="6.25in" height="5.0625in"}

Figure 6.6.4.1-1: Configuration of parameters for public safety
discovery

0: If needed the UE could be configured with any private keys,
associated certificates or root certificate that may be needed for
contacting the ProSe Key Management Function to allow the keys to be
kept secret from the operator. If none are provided, then the USIM
credentials are used to protect that interface.

1: The UE fetches the Relay Service Codes and Discovery Group IDs from
its HPLMN ProSe Function. Each one of these is associated with the ProSe
Key Management Function address that shall be used to fetch security
parameters for these types of discovery. These parameters may also be
pre-configured into the UE.

2.i: The Key Request and Response message are protected as described in
subclause 6.Y.6. The UE sends the Key Request message to the ProSe Key
Management Function including the relevant Relay Service Codes or the
Discovery Group ID that it wishes to get security material for.

2.ii: The ProSe Key Management Function checks the authorization for the
requested discoveries, and what types of protection to apply to it. The
authorisation check performed by PKMF will be successful only if the
Remote UE has subscribed to the relay service, the UE-to-Network relay
is authorised to act as a relay, or if the requesting UE is in the group
identified by the Discovery Group ID.

2.iii: The ProSe Key Management Function responds with the Key Response
message. If the check of step 2.ii is successful, this message contains
the *security metadata* associated with the discovery. Such *security
metadata* include information on how to protect the discovery and the
Key Type for that discovery.

2.iv: The ProSe Key Management Function sends the relevant PSDKs to the
UE using MIKEY.

2.v. The UE responds with a MIKEY Verification message if requested by
the PKMF

3\. The UE is now ready to send or receive protected discovery messages.

#### 6.6.4.2 Messages between UE and ProSe Key Management Function

##### 6.6.4.2.1 General

There are two types of messages that are exchanged between the UE and
ProSe Key Management Function. Firstly, there are the Key Request and
Response messages. The UE uses these messages to request and receive the
relevant PSDK and associated security material for the Public Safety
Discoveries it wishes to protect. Secondly, there are the MIKEY
messages, which the ProSe Key Management Function uses to send the PSDKs
to the UE. These messages are detailed in the following subclauses.

##### 6.6.4.2.2 Key Request and Key Response messages

The purpose of these messages is for the UE to request the PSDK from the
ProSe Key Management Function. The UE knows from which ProSe Key
Management Function(s) to get the needed PSDK(S), as the FQDN of the
PKMF are either pre-provisioned or provided by the ProSe Function.

The UE shall not release the PDN connection used to receive MIKEY
messages containing PSDKs until the UE has informed each ProSe Key
Management Function that it no longer requires PSDK(s). This is to
ensure that the ProSe Key Management Function is aware of the correct UE
IP address for the purpose of performing PSDK deliveries as specified in
clause 6.6.4.2.3.

If the UE detects that a PDN connection, which is used for receiving
PSDKs is released by the network, the UE should try to send a new Key
Request to inform the ProSe Key Management Function of its new IP
address. This is to ensure that the ProSe Key Management Function
becomes aware of the new UE IP address for the purpose of performing
PSDK deliveries. Any new IP address should override any existing ones of
the UE at the ProSe Key Management Function.

When sending a Key Request for a PSDK, the UE shall include all the
relevant details of all types of keys that the UE is expecting to
receive form the PKMF, e.g. any PGKs for one-to-many ProSe
communication.

Figure 6.6.4.2.2-1: Key Request/Response message

The protection for the Key Request and Key Response message is described
in subclause 6.6.6.

When sending a Key Request message to request the ProSe Key Management
Function to send PSDKs or to change the Relay Service Codes or Group
Discovery IDs for which it wants to receive keys, the UE shall include
the following information;

\- The UE's public safety discovery security capabilities, which
indicate whether the UE supports scrambling or not;

\- List of Relay Service Codes and Discovery Group IDs for which the UE
would like to receive keys;

\- For each Relay Service Code or Discovery Group ID, the PSDK ID of any
keys for those discovery that the UE holds. If the UE holds no keys for
this discovery, then it sends an all zero PSDK ID;

\- List of Relay Service Codes and Discovery Group IDs for which the UE
would like to stop receiving keys.

The ProSe Key Management Function shall check that the UE is authorised
to receive keys for the requested discoveries. This is done by using the
UE identity that is bound to the keys that established the TLS tunnel in
which the message is sent. If the UE isn't then the ProSe Key Management
Function responds with the appropriate error. The ProSe Key Management
Function shall also check UE's public safety discovery security
capabilities to find out whether UE supports scrambling or not, and
responds with an appropriate error if not. The ProSe Key Management
Function shall update the stored set of the discoveries for which the UE
will be sent keys.

The ProSe Key Management Function responds to the UE with a Key Response
message that includes the following parameters:

\- List of the Relay Service Codes and Discovery Group IDs that were
included in the Key Request message;

\- For each discovery (relay or group member) that keys will be supplied
for, the security meta-data that should be used to indicate how to
protect the discovery message and the Key Type ID for the discovery; and

\- for each of the other groups, a status code to indicate why keys will
not be supplied for that group.

\- An optional PMK and PMK Identity.

\- CURRENT\_TIME and MAX\_OFFSET.

For the groups that the UE will get keys for, the UE shall store the
received information associated with that discovery. If a PMK and PMK
identity are included, the UE shall store these and delete any
previously stored ones for this ProSe Key Management Function. The
security meta-data inform the UE whether it needs to apply scrambling,
message specific confidentiality and/or MIC checking (see subclause
6.1.3.4.3). If message-specific confidentiality is needed, then the
security meta-data includes the Encrypted\_bit\_mask.

The UE uses CURRENT\_TIME and MAX\_OFFSET in the same way as from Open
Discovery: the UE may start announcing only if the UTC-based counter
provided by the system associated with the discovery slot is within the
MAX\_OFFSET of the announcing UE\'s ProSe clock. The UE's ProSe clock is
(re)set based on the provided CURRENT\_TIME.

The ProSe Key Management Function shall initiate the PGK delivery
procedures for the keys that are needed by the UE.

##### 6.6.4.2.3 MIKEY messages

##### 6.6.4.2.3.1 General

MIKEY is used to transport the PSDKs from the ProSe Key Management
Function to the UE. MIKEY is used exactly as in subclause 6.2.3.3.2.3
(which is for carrying PGKs), except as follows:

\- IDi payload is formed from the Key Type ID \|\| PSDK ID @ FQDN of the
ProSe Key Management Function at the PKMF.

\- The UE recognises that it is receiving a PSDK rather than PGK based
on the Key Type ID in the IDi payload.

\- An all zero PSDK ID is used to trigger the UE to send a Key Request
message.

### 6.6.5 Protection of traffic between UE and ProSe Function

In order to protect the messages between the UE and ProSe Function, the
UE shall support the procedures for the UE given in subclause 5.3.3.2
and the ProSe Function shall support the procedures for the network
function given in subclause 5.3.3.

### 6.6.6 Protection of traffic between UE and ProSe Key Management Function

In order to protect the UE-initiated messages between the UE and ProSe
Key Management Function, the UE shall support the procedures for the UE
given in subclause 5.3.3.2 and the ProSe Key Management Function shall
support the procedures for the network function given in subclause
5.3.3.2.

The MIKEY messages are protected as described in subclause 6.6.4.2.3.1.

### 6.6.7 Protection of discovery messages between the UEs

The protection of ProSe Public Safety Discovery Message over PC5 is very
similar to that of Restricted Discovery. When sending and receieving a
discovery message, the UE uses the PSDK that has not expired (using the
time in the UTC based counter associated with the discovery slot to
check expiry) and has the earliest expiration time to derive the needed
subkeys for the security of that message.

In order to protect the discovery messages over PC5, the UE first
calculates the necessary (as indicated in the security meta-data) DUSK,
DUCK and DUIK for the particular discovery using the appropriate PSDK.
To this end, a KDF is used to derive each of the keys indicated in the
security meta-data, as follows:

\- If the security meta-data indicates a DUSK should be used, then the
UE derives the DUSK from the PSDK using a KDF as in Annex A.8.

\- If the security meta-data indicates a DUCK should be used, and an
Encrypted\_bits\_mask is included, then the UE derives the DUCK from the
PSDK using a KDF as in Annex A.8

If the security meta-data indicates a DUIK should be used, then the UE
derives the DUIK from the PSDK using a KDF as in Annex A.8.

A sending UE then follows subclause 6.1.3.4.3.2, while a receiving UE
follows subclause 6.1.3.4.3.3 except that it never sends the discovery
message to the ProSe Function for MIC checking.

6.7 Security for ProSe UE-to-network relays 
-------------------------------------------

### 6.7.1 General 

The ProSe UE-to-network relays procedures are described in TS 23.303
\[2\]. This clause details the security procedures for ProSe
UE-to-network relays.

The functionality in this clause may only be supported by ProSe-enabled
Public Safety UEs.

### 6.7.2 Security Requirements

The requirements in clause 5.3.2 apply for the signalling between the UE
and ProSe Function.

For the discovery, the security requirement in subclause 6.6.2 apply.

For the distribution of the keys used to protect the relay signalling,
the following requirements apply:

\- The keys shall be protected in integrity and confidentiality during
their distribution.

\- Only authorized Public Safety ProSe-enabled UEs shall receive the
keys.

\- It shall be possible for the Public Safety ProSe-enabled UE to
authenticate the network entity distributing the keys.

\- Authorized Public Safety Prose-enabled UEs shall securely store the
shared keys.For the non-discovery communication between the Remote UE
and relay, the requirements on one-to-one communication in subclause
6.5.2 apply except the one on mutual authentication of out of coverage
UEs.

The system shall support mutual authentication between Remote UE and
UE-to-Network Relay.

Both Remote UE and UE-to-Network Relay shall be authorised by the ProSe
Function.

### 6.7.3 Overview of ProSe UE-to-network relay security

#### 6.7.3.1 General

The ProSe UE-to-network relay procedures consist of two distinct phases,
i.e. the discovery of the UE-to-network relay and the communication
between the Remote UE and UE-to-network relay.

The security of the discovery messages uses the procedures provided in
the current specification. The security of the communication between the
Remote UE and UE-to-network relay uses the procedures described in
clause 6.5 to establish the security context and protect the actual
communication. The part of the security establishment that is specific
to the UE-to-network relay use case is the establishment of the shared
key K~D~. The procedures for this operation are described in the next
subclause.

Following the general sequence of flows for public safety one to one
communication, a shared key K~D~ needs to be established. This key
serves to derive session keys between the Remote UE and the
UE-to-network relay.

In order to generate K~D~, the Remote UE needs a ProSe Relay User Key
(PRUK) and an associated 64-bit PRUK ID from a PKMF. The PRUK ID is used
to identify the PRUK to the PKMF of the UE-to-network relay. The PRUK
can be used to generate K~D~ for any of the relays under a particular
PKMF and hence only one PRUK for each Remote UE is needed from a
particular PKMF. This PRUK needs to the fetched by the Remote UE while
it is still in coverage. This implies that the Remote UE must contact
all the PKMFs of any potential relays it wants to be able to use.

The Remote UE fetches its PRUK from the PKMF using the Key
Request/Response messages or may receive one through GBA PUSH as part of
establishing the communication with the relay. The UE-to-network relay
fetches the K~D~ that will be used to secure the communication by
sending to its PKMF the PRUK ID or IMSI if the Remote UE does not have a
PRUK for the relay or the supplied PRUK has been rejected. At the PKMF
side, the corresponding PRUK is retrieved. The K~D~ is then derived from
the PRUK using a K~D~ Freshness Parameter (a locally generated random
number), which the PKMF then passes to the Remote UE via the
UE-to-network Relay, a nonce sent by the Remote UE via the UE-to-network
Relay and the Relay Service Code the Remote UE wishes to access. The
UE-to-network Relay receives the K~D~ and the K~D~ Freshness Parameter,
and stores the K~D~. Having obtained the K~D~ Freshness Parameter
enables the Remote UE to derive the same K~D~ as the PKMF did.

If the Remote UE receives a new PRUK in a Key Response message, it
deletes any previous one for that PKMF. If it receives a new one through
a GBA PUSH message, it shall overwrite any PRUK received through a GBA
PUSH message that has not been successfully used to establish a relay
connection. Once a PRUK received through a GBA PUSH Message has been
used to calculate a K~D~ for a sucessful relay connection establishment,
the Remote UE shall delete any previous PRUKs for this PKMF.

#### 6.7.3.2 Security flows

##### 6.7.3.2.1 Overview

This subclause describes the overall security flows for UE-to-network
relays. These includes the basic attach flows, dealing with
re-synchronisation errors in GPI and the rekeying flows.

###### 6.7.3.2.1.1 Remote UE attaching to a ProSe UE-to-network relay

There are several possible ways that the parameters needed for
UE-to-network relay can be provisioned onto the Remote UE and
UE-to-network relay. The flow described in Figure 6. 7.3.2.1.1-1 is for
the case when the general pararmeters are fetched from the ProSe
Function(s). In other cases some of the steps can be omited if the
relevant parameters are already in place. The figure shows only the
parameters that are relevant to the UE-to-network relay security and not
all the parameters carried by each message.

Figure 6.7.3.2.1.1-1: UE-to-network relay security flows

0\. The Remote UE and the UE-to-network relay fetch the parameters
necessary to act as a Remote UE and UE-to-network relay respectively
(see TS 23.303\[2\]), the PKMF address for accessing the relay and the
security parameters required to protect the relay discovery messages
(see subclause 6.6).

NOTE: Part of step 0b may be performed at the same time as step 1a to 1b
as the same messages are used to initiate fetching the keys for
protecting relay discovery.

1a. The Remote UE sends a Key Request message to the PKMF of the
UE-to-network relay. The message indicates that the Remote UE is
requesting a ProSe Relay User Key (PRUK) from the PKMF. If the Remote UE
already has a PRUK from this PKMF, the message shall also contain the
PRUK ID of the PRUK.

1b. The ProSe Key Management Function shall check that the Remote UE is
authorised to receive UE-to-network Relay service from one of its
relays. This is done by using the Remote UE identity that is bound to
the keys that established the TLS tunnel in which the message is sent.
If the Remote UE is successfully authorised, the PKMF sends a Key
Response message to the Remote UE that may contain a PRUK and PRUK ID.
If a PRUK and PRUK ID are included, the Remote UE shall store these and
delete any previously stored ones for this ProSe Key Management
Function.

2\. The Remote UE discovers the UE-to-network Relay using either model A
or model B discovery.

3\. The Remote UE sends a Direct Communication Request. The Long Term ID
shall contain the PRUK ID of the PRUK that the Remote UE want to use to
get relay connectivity if the Remote UE has a PRUK for this relay and an
attempt to connect to this relay has not been rejected due to the PRUK
ID not being recognised. Otherwise the Remote UE shall use its IMSI in
the Long Term ID. The Direct Communication Request contains the Relay
Service Code that the Remote UE would like to access.

4a. The UE-to-network relay sends a Key Request message to the PKMF. The
message shall contain the PRUK ID or IMSI, the Relay Service Code and
Nonce\_1 (see subclause 6.5.5.2) provided by the Remote UE. The PKMF
identifies the UE by the PRUK ID or IMSI. The PKMF checks the context of
the Remote UE to confirm whether it can connect to the network via the
selected ProSe UE-to-network Relay for the given Relay Service Code.

4b. If the PKMF confirms the Remote UE can connect to the network via
the selected ProSe UE-to- network Relay, the PKMF decides if it requires
a new PRUK for this UE, i.e. policy in the PKMF decides that PRUK ID
needs refreshing or the relay provided the IMSI of the UE. If so the
PKMF proceeds as follows:

If the PKMF supports the Zpn interface to the BSF of the UE, the PKMF
shall request a GBA Push Info (GPI -- see TS 33.223\[38\]) for the
Remote UE from the BSF. When requesting the GPI, it includes a non-zero
64-bit PRUK ID in the P-TID field. On reception of the GPI, the PKMF
uses Ks(\_ext)\_NAF as the PRUK.

If the PKMF support the PC4a interface to the HSS of the UE, then the
PKMF shall request an Authentication Vector (AV) for the UE. On
receiving the AV, the PKMF locally forms the GPI including a non-zero
64-bit PRUK ID in the P-TID field and sets PRUK as above.

4c. The PKMF generate a random number as the K~D~ Freshness Parameter.
The PKMF uses the PRUK to calculate K~D~ with the Relay Service Code,
Nonce\_1 and K~D~ Freshness Parameter as inputs. The PKMF shall send the
Remote UE Identity, K~D~, K~D~ Freshness Parameter and the GPI if used
to calculate a fresh PRUK to the UE-to-network relay.

5a. Using the supplied K~D~ to protect the message, the UE-to-network
relay sends a Direct Security Mode Command message to the Remote UE (see
6.5.2.2). This message shall contain the K~D~ Freshness Parameter and
the GPI if it received them from the PKMF.

5b. If the Remote UE receives a GPI, it calculates a new PRUK and
associated PRUK ID (see step 4b above). The Remote UE derives K~D~ from
its PRUK and the received K~D~ Freshness Parameter, Nonce\_1 and the
Relay Service Code (as described in Annex A.Y). It then processes the
Direct Security Mode Command as described in 6.5.2.2. If this is
successful, the Remote UE responds with a Direct Security Mode Complete
message and the Remote UE and UE-to-network relay may start to exchange
user data.

###### 6.7.3.2.1.2 Re-synchronisation in GBA Push authentication

This subclause provides the flows when the UE discovers a
synchronisation failure when processing the authentication challenge
that was sent to it as part of the GPI (for details of synchronisation
failures -- see TS 33.102\[42\]). Synchronisation failures can happen in
both the attachment flow (described in subclause 6.7.3.2.1.1) and the
rekeying flow (described in subclause 6.7.3.1.3). The re-synchronisation
flow is shown in figure 6.7.3.2.1.2-1, which only shows the contents of
messages that are different for the synchronisation case.

Figure 6. 7.3.2.1.2-1: Re-synchronisation flows

This steps are the identical to the Attach and rekeying flows up to the
Direct Security Mode Command in these flows

1a. The Direct Security Mode Command contains the same parameters as the
Direct Security Mode Command in the Attach or rekeying flows. On
processing the GPI parameter contained in this message, the ME receives
a synchronisation failure response for the USIM.

1b. The Remote UE send a Direct Security Mode Failure to the relay that
contains the RAND and AUTS parameters

2a. The relay send a Key Request message to the PKMF of the Relay and
includes the RAND and AUTS received from the Remote UE.

2b. If the PKMF supports the Zpn interface to the BSF of the UE, the
PKMF shall request a GBA Push Info (GPI -- see TS 33.223\[38\]) for the
Remote UE from the BSF and include the RAND and AUTS parameters. When
requesting the GPI, it includes the 64-bit PRUK ID in the P-TID field.
On reception of the GPI, the PKMF uses Ks(\_ext)\_NAF as the PRUK.

If the PKMF support the PC4a interface to the HSS of the UE, then the
PKMF shall request an Authentication Vector (AV) for the UE and include
the RAND and AUTS parameters. On receiving the AV, the PKMF locally
forms the GPI including the 64-bit PRUK ID in the P-TID field and sets
PRUK as above.

2c, 3a and 3b. These messages are identical to the corresponding
messages in the Attach and rekeying flows.

###### 6.7.3.2.1.3 Rekeying procedures

Due to the asymmetric nature of the keying for relays, there are three
rekeying cases that need to be considered. Firstly there is the rekeying
that only changes K~D-Sess~ but not K~D~. Secondly there is the rekeying
that is initiated by the Remote UE that changes K~D~ and finally
rekeying that is initiated by the relay that changes K~D~. Each of these
is described in turn.

Rekeying without changing K~D~ happens exactly as described in subclause
6.5.5.3. The Remote UE includes its PRUK ID as the Long Term ID in the
Direct Rekey Request messages, whereas the relay does not include a Long
Term Key ID.

A rekeying that changes K~D~ that is triggered by the Remote UE is shown
in figure 6.7.3.2.1.3-1. The steps follow subclause 6.5.5.3 and only
message contents that are specific to this use are included

Figure 6.7.3.2.1.3-1: Rekeying K~D~ when rekeying was initiated by the
Remote UE

1; The Remote UE send a Direct Rekey Request including its PRUK ID to
the Relay.

2a, 2b, 2c, 3a and 3b. The content and handling of these messages are
the same as messages in the Attach flow (subclause 6. 7.3.2.1.1) except
the security contexts are handled as in subclause 6.5.5.3.

A rekeying that changes K~D~ that is initiated by the relay proceeds as
follows. The relay sends a Direct Key Request that does not contain a
Long Term ID. Instead of responding to this message, the Remote UE sends
its own Direct Rekey Request and the procedure continues as for the
rekeying that changes K~D~ that is triggered by the Remote UE.

##### 6.7.3. 2.2 Messages between the Remote UE and ProSe Key Management Function

###### 6.7.3. 2.2.1 General

Key Request and Response messages are exchanged between the Remote UE
and ProSe Key Management Function. The Remote UE uses these messages to
request a PRUK to use with relays. These messages are detailed in the
following subclauses.

###### 6.7.3. 2.2.2 Key Request and Key Response messages

The purpose of these messages is for the Remote UE to request the PRUK
from the ProSe Key Management Function. The Remote UE knows from which
ProSe Key Management Function(s) to get the needed PRUK(s) as the
FQDN(s) of the PKMF(s) are either pre-provisioned or provided by the
ProSe Function in the HPLMN of the Remote UE.

When sending a Key Request for a PRUK, the Remote UE shall include all
the relevant details of all types of keys that the Remote UE is
expecting to receive from the PKMF, e.g. any PGKs for one-to-many ProSe
communication.

Figure 6.7.3. 2.2.2-1: Key Request/Response for Remote UE

The protection for the Key Request and Key Response message is described
in subclause 6.7.3.4.

When sending a Key Request message to request the ProSe Key Management
Function to send to either get a PRUK or ensure its PRUK is upto date,
the Remote UE shall include the following information;

\- An indication of whether the Remote UE wants to receive PRUKs from
this PKMF.

\- PRUK ID (if any) that the Remote UE has for this PKMF. If it has none
it send an all zero PRUK ID.

The ProSe Key Management Function shall check that the Remote UE is
authorised to receive PRUKs. This is done by using the Remote UE
identity that is bound to the keys that established the TLS tunnel in
which the message is sent. If the Remote UE is not authorised, then the
ProSe Key Management Function responds with the appropriate error.

The ProSe Key Management Function responds to the Remote UE with a Key
Response message that includes the following parameters:

\- If the Remote UE is authorised to receive PRUKs, then the message may
include a PRUK and PRUK ID

\- Otherwise, a status code to indicate why PRUKs will not be supplied.

If a PRUK and PRUK ID are included, the Remote UE shall store these and
delete any previously stored ones that were obtained from this ProSe Key
Management Function.

##### 6.7.3. 2.3 Messages between the Relay and ProSe Key Management Function

###### 6.7.3. 2.3.1 General

There are only Key Request/Response messages exchanged between the
UE-to-network Relay and ProSe Key Management Function.

###### 6.7.3. 2.3.2 Key Request and Key Response messages

The purpose of these messages is for the Relay to request the K~D~ from
the ProSe Key Management Function.

Figure 6.7.3. 2.3.2-1: Key Request/Response for Relay

The protection for the Key Request and Key Response message is described
in subclause 6. 7.3.4.

When sending a Key Request message to request the ProSe Key Management
Function to request a K~D~, the UE-to-network relay shall include the
following information;

\- Either the PRUK ID or the IMSI that was provided in the Direct
Communication Request message or Direct Rekey Request;

\- Relay Service Code that the Remote UE requested to use;

\- Nonce\_1 that was sent from the Remote UE to the UE-to-network relay
in either the Direct Commuications Request or Direct Rekey Request that
triggered this Key Request; and

\- RAND and AUTS, in the case of a synchronisation failure of the AV in
the GPI.

The ProSe Key Management Function shall check that the Relay is
authorised to serve the identified Remote UE for the supplied Relay
Service Code. This is done by using the Relay's identity that is bound
to the keys that established the TLS tunnel in which the message is
sent. If the Relay is not authorised or the Remote UE can not be
identified, then the ProSe Key Management Function responds with the
appropriate error.

If the ProSe Key Management Function decides to provide a K~D~ to the
UE-to-network relay, then it generates a random number that it sends as
the K~D~ Freshness parameter to the UE-to-network relay. The ProSe Key
Management Function also calculates the K~D~ (as described in Annex A.Y)
from either the PRUK related to the supplied PRUK ID or the new PRUK if
this is to be updated (see subclause 6.X.3.2.1.1). In addition to these
parameter, the ProSe Key Management Function also provides a Remote UE
Identity that the UE-to-network relay provides to the MME. The Remote UE
Identity is either the IMSI, MSISDN or a 128-bit string.

NOTE: In general, IMSI should not be sent outside of the operator
network in order to protect user privacy. The UE-to-Network Relay cannot
be regarded as a network entity in the traditional sense e.g. as an eNB.
On the other hand, the PKMF may have a sufficient level of trust in a
UE-to-Network Relays to provide the IMSI. Instead of sending the IMSI,
the PKMF can send a 128-bit string to the UE-to-Network Relay instead of
the IMSI. The string should be such that the MME map the character
string to a wanted Remote UE identity (e.g. IMSI) but that the
UE-to-Network Relay cannot deduce the Remote UE identity. How this
mapping is done in the MME has not be specified by SA3. The mapping
information needs to be provisioned into the MME.

The ProSe Key Management Function responds to the Relay with a Key
Response message that includes the following parameters:

\- For a successful case,

\- a K~D~;

\- K~D~ Freshness parameter;

\- an optional GPI; and

\- Remote UE Identity.

\- Otherwise, a status code to indicate why K~D~ will not be supplied.

#### 6.7.3.3 Protection of traffic between Remote UE or Relay and ProSe Function

In order to protect the messages between the Remote UE/UE-to-network
Relay and ProSe Function, the Remote UE/UE-to-network relay shall
support the procedures for the UE given in subclause 5.3.3.2 and the
ProSe Function shall support the procedures for the network function
given in subclause 5.3.3.2.

#### 6.7.3.4 Protection of traffic between Remote UE or Relay and ProSe Key Management Function

In order to protect the messages between the Remote UE/ UE-to-network
Relay and ProSe Key Management Function, the Remote UE/UE-to-network
Relay shall support the procedures for the UE given in subclause 5.3.3.2
and the ProSe Key Management Function shall support the procedures for
the network function given in subclause 5.3.3.2.

#### 6.7.3.5 Protection of traffic between Remote UE and Relay

The signalling and user plane traffic sent between the Remote UE and
UE-to-network relay are protected as described in subclause 6.5.6

E.5 General message format and information elements coding
==========================================================

E.5.1 Overview

This clause contains general message format and information elements
coding for the messages used in the procedures described in the present
document.

E.5.2 ProSe direct discovery message formats

E.5.2.1 Data types format in XML schema

To exchange structured information over the transport protocol, XML text
format/notation is introduced.

The corresponding XML data types for the data types used in Key
Management messages are provided in table E.5.5.1-1.

Table E.2.5.1-1: Primitive or derived types for ProSe Parameter Type

  ---------------------- --------------------
  ProSe Parameter Type   Type in XML Schema
  Integer                decimal
  String                 string
  Boolean                boolean
  Binary                 hexBinary
  Date and Time          dateTime
  ---------------------- --------------------

For complex data types described in subclause E.5.2.2, an XML
\"complexType\" can be used.

Message construction shall be compliant with
W3C REC-xmlschema-2-20041028: \"XML Schema Part 2: Datatypes\" \[36\]

### E.5.2.2 Parameters in ProSe key management messages

#### E.5.2.2.1 Transaction ID 

This parameter is used to uniquely identify a ProSe Key management
transaction. The UE shall set this parameter to a new number for each
outgoing new discovery request. The transaction ID is an integer in the
0-255 range.

#### E.5.2.2.2 Supported Algorithm

This parameter is used to indicate which encryption algorithm the UE
supports for one-to-many commuications. It is a 1 octet long binary
parameter encoded as shown in table E.5.2.2.2-1:

######## Annex F (Informative): Network options for PC3 security

F.1 General 
===========

The present annex describes the network options for securing PC3 and PC8
interfaces.

F.2 Prose Function using standalone BSF
=======================================

The network option for Prose Function using standalone BSF is described
below:

Figure F.2-1: Prose Function using standalone BSF.

This architecture follows the GBA architecture, where the ProSe Function
and the ProSe Key Management Function are acting asa NAF.

F.3 BSF - Prose Function/NAF colocation 
=======================================

The network option for Prose Function using colocated BSF is described
below:

Figure F.3-1: BSF -- Prose Function colocation

In this architecture the BSF is colocated with the ProSe Function and
the ProSe Key Management Function acting as a NAF. Zn interface is
present between BSF and ProSe Function and also between BSF and ProSe
Key Management Function.

F.4 Prose Function with bootstrapping entity
============================================

The network option for Prose Function with bootstrapping entity is
described below:

Figure F.4-1: Prose Function with bootstrapping entity

In this architecture the ProSe Function and the ProSe Key Management
Function are enhanced in the way that the subset of BSF and NAF
functionality towards the UE is reused, specifically the protocols
defined for Ub and Ua reference points. Interfaces Zn and Zh are not
used. Functionality of retrieving the authentication vector in order to
support the mutually authenticated key exchange is the responsibility of
the PC4a interface between the ProSe Function and the HSS, or the PC4a\*
interface between ProSe Key Management Function and HSS.

######## Annex G (Informative): Protection of Restricted Discovery and Public Safety Discovery messages

G.1 General 
===========

Both Restricted Discovery messages and Public Saftey Discovery message
are to be protected by some combination of scrambling, message-specific
confidentiality and integrity protection (see subclause 6.1.3.4.3). The
particular combinations that may be applied to each of these cases are
not restricted by the standard, but are controlled by the ProSe
Function(s) (in the case of Restricted Discovery) and the PKMF (in the
case of Public Safety Discovery). This control is applied by the ProSe
Function or PKMF signalling the chosen security measures for a
particular discovery to the UE. The UE then applies the requested
security to discovery messages that it sends or receives. This Annex
provides information on the security provided by the combinations of
security mechanisms.

G.2 Different combinations of security mechanisms
=================================================

Table G.2-1 provides details of the security provided and sample use
case(s) for the various combinations of security mechanisms that are
possible for Restricted Discovery and Public Safety Discovery. This
table is provided to help with the configuration in the ProSe Function
or PKMF of the appropriate security mechanisms for a particular
discovery and does not restrict the combination of security mechansisms
that the UE supports for either Restricted or Public Safety Discovery
(for details on UE processing of discovery messages, see subclauses
6.1.3.4.3.2 and 6.1.3.4.3.3).

The \"Sending UE\" column describes what keys need to be known to the
sending UE in the case of Restricted Discovery or signalled for use by
the PKMF in the case of Public Safety Discovery. The \"Receiving side\"
column shows what keys need to be sent to the receiving UE for
Restricted Discovery, except if ProSe Function MIC checking is required
(when the DUIK is kept at the ProSe Function in the HPLMN of the
receiving UE), or signalled for use by the PKMF. The \"Security
provided\" column details the security that this combination of security
mechanisms provide. The final column provides example use case(s) where
this combination of security mechanisms can be used.
