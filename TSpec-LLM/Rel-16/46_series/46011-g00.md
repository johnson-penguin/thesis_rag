Foreword
========

This Technical Specification has been produced by the 3^rd^ Generation
Partnership Project (3GPP).

The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work
within the TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the
TSG modify the contents of the present document, it will be re-released
by the TSG with an identifying change of release date and an increase in
version number as follows:

Version x.y.z

where:

x the first digit:

1 presented to TSG for information;

2 presented to TSG for approval;

3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.

y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e.
technical enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.

z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been
incorporated in the document.

1 Scope
=======

The present document defines a frame substitution and muting procedure
which shall be used by the RX DTX handler when one or more lost speech
or SID frames are received from the radio subsystem.

The requirements of the present document are mandatory for
implementation in all GSM Base Station Systems (BSS) and Mobile Stations
(MS).

3 Definitions and abbreviations

GSM 06.31 \[3\].

4 General
=========

The purpose of the frame substitution is to conceal the effect of lost
frames.

The purpose of muting the output in the case of several lost frames is
to indicate the breakdown of the channel to the user.

5 Requirements
==============

5.1 First lost speech frame
---------------------------

Normal decoding of lost speech frames would result in very unpleasant
noise effects. In order to improve the subjective quality, the first
lost speech frame shall be substituted with either a repetition or an
extrapolation of the previous good speech frame(s). Lost speech frames
shall not be delivered to the speech decoder, nor shall the output be
muted directly.

5.2 Subsequent lost speech frames
---------------------------------

For subsequent lost speech frames, a muting technique shall be used that
will gradually decrease the output level, resulting in silencing of the
output after a maximum of 320 ms. Clause 6 gives an example solution.

5.3 First lost SID frame
------------------------

A single lost SID frame shall be substituted by the last valid SID frame
and the procedure for valid SID frames be applied as described in GSM
06.31 \[3\].

5.4 Subsequent lost SID frame
-----------------------------

For the second lost SID frame, a muting technique shall be used on the
comfort noise that will gradually decrease the output level, resulting
in silencing of the output after a maximum of 320 ms. Clause 6 gives an
example solution.

For subsequent lost SID frames, the muting of the output shall be
maintained.

6 Example solution
==================

For guidance, an example solution is given.

The first lost speech frame is replaced at the speech decoder input by
the previous good speech frame. Normal decoding is then performed.

The muting procedure to be used in the case of subsequent lost speech
frames or for comfort noise frames following the second lost SID frame
is as follows:

The pseudo‑logarithmic encoded block amplitude Xmaxcr (GSM 06.10 \[2\]),
coded on the interval from 0 to 63, is decreased with a constant value
d=4 in each frame, down to the lowest possible value. Consequently,
Xmaxcr will be reduced gradually, and the output muted after a maximum
of 320 ms. The grid position parameters are chosen randomly between 0
and 3 during this time.

For subsequent unusable frames, after the frame where Xmaxcr reached the
lowest possible value, \"silence frames\" are passed from the RX DTX
handler to the speech decoder to guarantee a low output level under all
conditions. The silence frame is defined in table 1.
