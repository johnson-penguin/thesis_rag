4 Introduction
==============

Figure 1 presents a reference configuration where the various speech
processing functions are identified. In this figure, the relevant
technical specifications for each function are also indicated.

In figure 1, the audio parts including analogue to digital and digital
to analogue conversion are included to show the complete speech path
between the audio input/output in the Mobile Station (MS) and the
digital interface to the PSTN. The specification of the audio parts are
contained in GSM 03.50 \[2\] (Transmission plan aspects of the speech
service in the GSM PLMN system). These aspects are only considered in
the GSM 06‑series to the extent that the performance of the audio parts
affect the performance of the speech transcoder.

5 Full rate speech transcoding (GSM 06.10)
==========================================

As shown in figure 1, the speech encoder takes its input as a 13 bit
uniform PCM signal either from the audio part of the mobile station or
on the network side, from the PSTN via an 8 bit/A‑law or μ-law (PCS
1900) to 13 bit uniform PCM conversion. The encoded speech at the output
of the speech encoder is delivered to the channel coding function
defined in GSM 05.03 to produce an encoded block consisting of 456 bits
leading to a gross bit rate of 22,8 kbit/s.

In the receive direction, the inverse operations take place. GSM
06.10 \[3\] describes the detailed mapping between input blocks of 160
speech samples in 13 bit uniform PCM format to encoded blocks of 260
bits and from encoded blocks of 260 bits to output blocks of 160
reconstructed speech samples. The sampling rate is 8 000 sample/s
leading to an average bit rate for the encoded bit stream of 13 kbit/s.
The coding scheme is the so‑called Regular Pulse Excitation ‑ Long Term
prediction ‑ Linear Predictive Coder, here‑after referred to as RPE‑LTP.

The technical specification describes the codec down to the bit level,
thus enabling the verification of compliance to the technical
specification to a high degree of confidence by use of a set of digital
test sequences. These test sequences are also described and are
available on floppy disks.

6 Full rate Discontinuous Transmission (DTX) (GSM 06.31)
========================================================

During a normal conversation, the participants alternate so that, on the
average, each direction of transmission is occupied about 50 % of the
time. Discontinuous transmission (DTX) is a mode of operation where the
transmitters are switched on only for those frames which contain useful
information. This may be done for the following two purposes:

1\) in the MS, battery life will be prolonged or a smaller battery could
be used for a given operational duration;

2\) the average interference level on the \"air\" is reduced, leading to
better spectrum efficiency.

The overall DTX mechanism is implemented in the DTX handlers (TX and RX)
described in GSM 06.31 \[6\] and requires the following functions which
are described in separate technical specifications:

‑ a Voice Activity Detector on the transmit side;

‑ evaluation of the background acoustic noise on the transmit side, in
order to transmit characteristic parameters to the receive side;

‑ generation on the receive side of a similar noise, called comfort
noise, during periods where the radio transmission is cut.

The transmission of comfort noise information to the receive side is
achieved by means of a special frame (Silence descriptor = SID). This
frame is transmitted at the end of speech bursts and serves as an end of
speech marker for the receive side. In order to update the comfort noise
characteristics at the receive side, SID frames are transmitted at
regular intervals also during speech pauses. This also serves the
purpose of improving the measurement of the radio link quality by the
radio subsystem.

For the overall DTX functionality, the DTX handlers interwork via
various flags with the Radio Subsystem, which is in control of the
actual transmitter keying on the TX side and which performs various
pre‑processing functions on the RX side. This is also described in GSM
06.31 \[6\].

A common terminology used throughout the GSM 06‑series of technical
specifications is also defined in the present document.

7 Full rate Voice Activity Detection (VAD) (GSM 06.32)
======================================================

The input to the VAD is a set of parameters computed by the full‑rate
speech encoder defined in GSM 06.10 \[3\]. The VAD uses this information
to decide whether each 20 ms speech coder frame contains speech or not.
Note that the VAD flag is an input to TX DTX handler and does not
control the transmitter keying directly.

The technical specification describes the VAD algorithm down to the bit
level. The conventions used in the bit‑exact specification are the same
as those used in GSM 06.10 \[3\]. The verification of compliance to the
technical specification is achieved by use of digital test sequences
applied to the same interface as the test sequences for the speech
codec. These test sequences are also described and are available on
floppy disks.

8 Full rate comfort noise insertion (GSM 06.12)
===============================================

When switching the transmission on and off during DTX operation, the
effect would be a modulation of the background noise at the receiving
end if no precautions were taken. When transmission is on, the
background noise is transmitted together with the speech to the
receiving end. As the speech burst ends, the connection is off and the
perceived noise would drop to a very low level. This step modulation of
noise is perceived as very annoying and may reduce the intelligibility
of speech if presented to a listener without modification.

This so‑called \"noise contrast effect\" is reduced in the GSM system by
inserting an artificial noise, termed comfort noise, at the receiving
end when speech is absent.

GSM 06.12 \[5\] deals with the detailed aspects of the comfort noise
process:

‑ the evaluation of the acoustic background noise in the transmitter;

‑ the noise parameter encoding (SID frames) and decoding;

‑ and the generation of comfort noise in the receiver.

The algorithm for updating the noise parameters during speech pauses is
also defined.

The comfort noise mechanism is based on the full rate speech codec
defined in GSM 06.10 \[3\].

9 Full rate lost speech frame substitution and muting (GSM 06.11)
=================================================================

In the receiver, frames may be lost due to transmission errors or frame
stealing. GSM 06.11 \[4\] describes the actions to be taken in these
cases, both for lost speech frames and for lost SID‑frames in DTX
operation.

In order to mask the effect of an isolated lost frame, a scheme is used,
where the lost speech frame is substituted by a predicted frame based on
previous frames. Insertion of silence frames is not allowed. For several
lost frames in a row, some muting technique must be used to indicate to
the customer that transmission is interrupted.

10 Full Rate codec homing (GSM 06.10, optional feature)
=======================================================

A codec homing procedure has been introduced to the GSM Full Rate speech
codec as an optional feature.

The GSM Full Rate speech transcoder and VAD algorithm (see figure 1) are
defined in bit exact arithmetic. Consequently, they shall react on a
given input sequence always with the corresponding bit exact output
sequence, provided that the internal state variables are also always
exactly in the same state at the beginning of the experiment.

The input test sequences provided in GSM 06.10 \[3\] shall force the
corresponding output test sequences, provided that the tested modules
are in their home‑state when starting.

The modules may be set into their home states by provoking the
appropriate homing‑functions.

NOTE: This is normally done during reset (initialization of the codec).

Special inband signalling frames (encoder‑homing‑frame and
decoder‑homing‑frame) also described in GSM 06.10 \[3\] have been
defined to provoke these homing‑functions also in remotely placed
modules.

This mechanism is specified to support three main areas:

\- type approval and laboratory test of mobile terminal equipment;

\- type approval and laboratory test of infrastructure equipment;

\- remote control and testing for operation and maintenance.

At the end of the first received homing frame, the audio functions that
are defined in a bit exact way shall be rendered into their predefined
home states. The output corresponding to the first homing frame is
dependent on the codec state when the frame was received. Any
consecutive homing frames shall produce corresponding homing frames at
the output.

11 Speech transmission functions of the half rate traffic channel
=================================================================

The gross bit rate of the half rate speech traffic channel is 11,4
kbit/s. The algorithm for the half rate speech transcoder as well as the
associated DTX functions are defined in GSM 06.02 \[8\], GSM
06.20 \[9\], GSM 06.21 \[10\], GSM 06.22 \[11\], GSM 06.41 \[12\] and
GSM 06.42 \[13\].
