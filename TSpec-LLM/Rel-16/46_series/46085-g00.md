4 General
=========

Clause 5 describes the testing methodologies adopted for the
internationally co-ordinated subjective evaluation of the
interoperability HR-FR-EFR.

Clause 6 describes the tools and procedures used by the host laboratory
to produce the processed speech material (speech was added with
environmental noise, when requested by the experimental design).

Clause 7 describes the results obtained from the set of tests carried
out by four laboratories.

Clause 8 describes the conclusions that can be drawn from the analysis
of all data that were produced over the two main phases of testing.

5 Testing methodology
=====================

A series of internationally co-ordinated subjective listening
experiments were carried out in four different laboratories. These
experiments were designed to investigate the performance issues
surrounding interoperability across the three GSM standards; Full Rate,
Half Rate, and Enhanced Full Rate GSM. The purpose of the experiments
was to determine the:

1\) quality under error conditions for single encodings, providing a
baseline when considering the results for tandemed connections;

2\) quality under tandem conditions, where all possible tandemings of
the three GSM standards are characterised under a range of channel
errors;

3\) quality with far end background noise, where both single encodings
and all possible combinations of the three GSM standards are
characterised under a range of channel errors;

4\) quality enhancements through the use of the TFO scheme;

5\) differences in perceived quality between the input frequency
responses \"flat\" and \"complying with ITU-T Modified IRS definition\".

To investigate these aspects, the testing was split into two phases:

\- phase 1 investigated all the possible tandem connections between the
three GSM standards in environments free of background noise. Also, the
potential quality benefits resulting from tandem-free operation were
investigated, as well as the effects of input frequency response;

\- phase 2 investigated all the possible tandem connections with the far
end was immersed in noisy environment. The noisy environments used were
street noise (with a 15 dB Signal to Noise Ratio) and vehicular noise
(with a 10 dB Signal to Noise Ratio). Only the Modified IRS input
frequency characteristic was used.

In both these phases, all of the investigations spanned the range of
channel error conditions; no errors, EP1, and EP2 (corresponding to C/I
= 10 dB and 7 dB, respectively, with ideal Frequency Hopping). Both
phases also checked the performance of each of the three GSM standards
as a single encoding (i.e. no tandeming).

MNRU reference conditions were included in all experiments. These serve
two main purposes. The first is to ensure that a suitable range of
qualities is presented to the subjects; not doing so can lead to unusual
results. The second is to provide a calibration of the judgement scale,
which allows for the possibility of comparing results across experiments
and laboratories.

Previous Technical Reports on GSM standards (GSM 06.08 and 06.55) used
an input level to the speech codec of ‑16 dBm0 (22 dB OVL). However, in
light of the recent availability of updated average distributions of
speech levels in fixed networks throughout the world (source ITU-T Rec.
G.117), a new nominal level of -20 dBm0 (-26 dB OVL) was used in the
investigations reported here. The use of this figure, sourced from
information drawn from the fixed network was selected in the absence of
any reliable statistics on the levels found in mobile networks. It
should also be noted that no reliable information is available on the
responses of microphones adopted for use in mobile terminals. It was for
this reason that the Modified IRS response (again sourced from
information on the fixed network) was used in the majority of these
experiments.

The remainder of this clause will discuss the two phases of
experimentation.

5.1 Phase 1: Investigation under conditions free of environmental noise
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Phase one was designed to characterise GSM performance in noise free
environments in order to provide information on the optimum performance
figures likely to be obtained across the three different standards.
Single encodings as well as tandemed connections between the available
GSM standards, both with and without the use of the TFO scheme were
investigated. The methodology used the ACR (Absolute Category Rating)
method based on a 5-point rating scale, as given in ITU-T Recommendation
P.800. To ensure that the maximum amount of information could be
extracted from the experiment, the following precautions were taken in
the experiment design:

\- to ensure that all the subjects started the experiments with similar
levels of expectation, a standard set of instructions was given to each
subject, and they were all given the same set of practice trials at the
start of the experiment. These practice trials covered a range of
conditions representative of the qualities in the main body of the
experiment. The scores from the practice trials are recorded, but are
not used in any further analysis, and hence are not reported on in the
present document;

\- it is known, particularly in ACR tests, that the order in which the
test material is presented to the subjects can have an effect on the
results due to carry-over effects. Three different presentation orders
were therefore used to minimise this;

\- subjects can experience fatigue if listening sessions are too long,
leading to an increase in the inherent variability of the results. The
phase 1 tests, required subjects to spend approximately one hour in the
experiment. For the reasons given, this was split into three sessions,
each of approximately 20 minutes separated by short breaks.

The results from this phase are discussed in subclauses 7.1 (single
encoding), 7.2 (tandem operation), 7.4 (TFO enhancements), and 7.5
(input frequency response).

5.2 Phase 2: Investigation under conditions with far end environmental noise
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Phase two was designed to evaluate the GSM algorithms with regard to
transmission quality in the presence of far end background noise. Two
types of noise were investigated, street noise at a signal to noise
ratio of 15 dB and vehicle noise at a signal to noise ratio of 10 dB.
The phase was split into two experiments, each of which investigated one
of the noise types. Other than this difference, these experiments were
identical in design. The methodology used the DCR (Degradation Category
Rating) method, where the opinions given by subjects are a measure of
the perceived difference between a quality reference and a degraded
sample. To ensure that the maximum amount of information could be
extracted from the experiment, the following precautions were taken in
the experiment design:

\- when investigating far end background noise, the effects of the noise
itself can dominate the results to such an extent that the influence of
the factors of interest are hidden. The Degradation Category Rating
method was selected to minimise this, as was the decision to place each
of the two different types of noise in separate experiments;

\- to ensure that all the subjects started the experiments with similar
levels of expectation, a standard set of instructions was given to each
subject, and they were all given the same set of practice trials at the
start of the experiment. These practice trials covered a range of
conditions representative of the qualities in the main body of the
experiment. The scores from the practice trials are recorded, but are
not used in any further analysis, and hence are not reported on in the
present document;

\- three different presentation orders were used to minimise the
possibility of carry-over effects;

\- subjects can experience fatigue if listening sessions are too long,
leading to an increase in the inherent variability of the results. The
phase 2 tests, required subjects to spend approximately one hour 15
minutes in the experiment. For the reasons given, this was split into
four sessions, each of just over 20 minutes separated by short breaks.

The results from this phase are discussed in subclause 7.3.

6 Test set-up
=============

**Overview of the Host Lab Simulation Tool**

In this section the different software components that are used by the
Host Lab simulation. We present also the way they are used by the
simulator.

**The software components**

**The UIT-T STL96**

In 1990 a group was set up within the CCITT to develop common software
tools to help the development of speech coding standards. The first
formal release of the library was the STL92. Matra Communication had
used \"IUT-T Software Tool Library Manual,\" ITU-T Users\' Group on
Software Tools, Geneva, May 1996, to develop the Software Tool used for
the optimization of the Half Rate GSM codec.

It includes many different tools but more precisely all the tools needed
to properly condition speech signals. It was mainly used for
pre-processing and post-processing. However it was also used for A-Law
PCM and MNRU.

**The Speech codecs**

The three speech codecs were simulated using 16-bit fixed point
libraries that are part of the codecs\' source code.

The test vectors of the three GSM speech codecs were successfully
processed by their respective codecs.

**[The Full Rate GSM]{.underline}**

The Full-Rate GSM simulation used (ETSI GSM Recommendation 06.10, \"GSM
full-rate speech transcoding\") has been developed in Matra\'s Speech
Processing Department. It was found easier to use this version rather
than the one which is provided in STL96. Bad Frame Handling was included
in the channel decoder function delivered by Nokia.

**[The Half-Rate GSM]{.underline}**

The Half-Rate simulation used is based on that described in ETSI GSM
Recommendation 06.20, \"GSM half-rate speech transcoding\". It was
checked that it corresponds to the latest version available on the ETSI
ftp server. The Bad Frame Handling simulation was that provided in ETSI
GSM Recommendation 06.06, \"ANSI-C code for the GSM half rate speech
codec\".

**[The Enhanced Full Rate GSM]{.underline}**

The Enhanced Full Rate (ETSI GSM Recommendation 06.60, \"GSM enhanced
full-rate speech transcoding\") simulation was based on versions 5.0 and
5.1 of ETSI GSM Recommendation 06.53, , \"ANSI-C code for the GSM
enhanced full rate codec\"). Version 5.0 was upgraded taking into
account the changes brought by version 5.1, i.e. initialization in the
pulse search and modification of the basic operators. The pre-channel
coding and the post-channel decoding of version 5.0 were kept.

**[The G.711 PCM codec]{.underline}**

A-Law PCM coding was performed using the functions provided in the STL96
\[\"IUT-T Software Tool Library Manual,\" ITU-T Users\' Group on
Software Tools, Geneva, May 1996\].

**The Channel codecs**

**[The Full Rate GSM]{.underline}**

It was agreed that the channel codec and above all the error Concealment
would have to be \"state-of-the-art\" as it had already been done for
the pre-qualification test of the EFR. In consequence it was asked to
Nokia if they could, as they had already done for the pre-qualification
tests, deliver such a simulation to the Host Lab.

An NDA was signed between Nokia and Matra Communication to enable the
use of these functions. Since Sun workstation are used in both
companies, it was decided to exchange object code compiled for such
systems.

**[The Half Rate GSM]{.underline}**

An NDA was signed between Motorola and Matra Communication in order to
use the Channel codec simulation that has already been used during the
complexity estimation and the Optimization of the Half Rate GSM.

The interfaces were updated with the help of Eric Winter of Motorola.

**[The Enhanced full Rate GSM]{.underline}**

Matra Communication received together with the source code of the EFR
v1.4 speech codec the source code of the channel codec. This was the one
that has been used so far to measure the performances of the EFR codec
in error conditions.

Therefore it was decided to use it in the Host Lab simulation.

**The Modulated Noise Reference Unit (MNRU)**

The so-called \"Duo-MNRU\" \[11\] \[12\] tool of STL96 was included in
the Host LAB simulation.

6.1 Host Lab processing for the evaluation of HR-FR-EFR interoperability (phase 1)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The processing carried out by Matra Communication under contract of the
ETSI were made using a Host Lab simulator. This section contains the
description of the Host Lab simulator.

**Modified IRS filtering procedure**

The first problem in phase 1A was due to a wrong interpretation of the
test plan by the Host Lab. The « HQN » key word of the command line was
wrongly interpreted as \"the spectral characteristic must be flat\".

We replace the « HQN » key word by « MIRS » in the test plan file and we
created a pre‑processing procedure to filter and adjust the level of the
speech material. This procedure is based on the function available in
the STL96. Figure 1 shows the scheme of this pre-processing.

Figure 1: Scheme of the pre-processing procedure: M-IRS filtering and
level adjustment

6.2 Error concealment for TCH/FS
--------------------------------

The second problem in phase 1A concerns the Error Concealment function
included in the TCH ‑ FS Channel Codec Libraries. During phase 1A this
function has been implicitly switched off by the provider. As decided
during the SEG \#8 meeting the provider sent to Matra a correct version
of the libraries. This version works correctly for all the possible
channel simulations (with or without noise insertion). In the demo tape
delivered by Matra (cf. SMG11 Tdoc 18/96) we provided some examples of
sentences in EP1 and EP2 conditions obtained by using the old and the
new versions of these libraries.

6.3 Control of codec simulation
-------------------------------

All the codecs used in this simulation have been tested using the test
vectors defined in the GSM recommendations. When the Host Lab simulator
is used in the « test mode » the pre‑processing, post‑processing and
channel coding procedure are bypassed as illustrated by figure 2. No
errors have been observed in the output file.

Figure 2: Scheme of the testing procedure using the test vectors

6.4 Pre-processing and post-processing procedure
------------------------------------------------

Figure 3 and figure 4 show the frequency response of the M-IRS filtering
module and the frequency response for the pre and post processing. The
behaviours of these frequency responses are closed to the frequency
responses presented in the STL96 documents.

6.5 Conclusion of Phase 1
-------------------------

All the accessible components of the Host Lab simulator have been tested
by Matra. No particular problem was observed during this phase of test.

6.6 Host Lab processing for the evaluation of HR-FR-EFR interoperability (phase 2)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The phase 2 of interoperability test have been carried out to evaluate
the performances of GSM speech codecs in environmental noise conditions.
The present document describes the noise mixing procedure used to
produce the speech material.

**Noise mixing process**

The original speech material used during phase 1 of test has been the
starting point to produce the input databases for phase 2. The procedure
used to produce these samples is the following (cf. figure 6). First of
all the sources (speech and noise) are filtered using the FIR version of
Modified IRS filter (M-IRS). Then they are gain‑scaled to obtain a -30
dBOv level for speech samples and the (‑30‑SNR) dBOv level for noise
source. The value of SNR is dependent on the noise characteristic: this
value is fixed to 15 dB for street noise and 10 dB for car noise.

Figure 6: Noise and speech mixing procedure

The gain scaling values are obtained using the STL\'96 speech voltmeter
for the speech samples (according with ITU-T Recommendation. P.56) and
using RMS measure for noise files.

The files filtered and scaled are then mixed by summing the samples. An
automatic control of overload is performed during the mixing procedure.
If a saturation occurred an expert listener checked if the quality of
the speech + noise sample is acceptable. If the clipping effect was
annoying the level of the speech after the M-IRS filter was down‑scaled
in a maximum range of 1 dB and the mixing procedure is restarted. During
the mixing procedure any saturation has been observed.

6.7 Processing
--------------

The data-bases obtained by the noise mixing procedure are processed
according to the test using the Host-Lab simulator.

6.8 Conclusion of Phase 2
-------------------------

During phase 2, test have been performed without any problem. Quality of
processed speech has been checked by MATRA speech expert. The processed
files were sent to the listening test laboratories in January 1997,
according to the time schedule defined during the first SMG11 meeting.

7 Summary of results
====================

The test results obtained from the subjective evaluation of the
interoperability HR-FR-EFR, considering the different combinations of
the three GSM standards, and also the so called TFO (Tandem-Free or
Transcoding-Free Operation), are summarised in the following
sub-clauses.

7.1 Quality under error conditions
----------------------------------

Statistical analysis and significance tests (at 95 % confidence level)
on the full set of raw data were performed in terms of Mean Opinion
Scores (MOS) and confidence intervals (C. I.), that were calculated to
interpret the statistical significance of differences between the given
scores.

An analysis of variance (using the General Linear Model) of all opinion
scores was carried out to show which factors under test (laboratories,
talkers, order of presentation, experimental conditions, and listeners)
did account for the subjective judgements. The analysis showed that all
factors were significant; anyway, the \'common behaviour\' showed by all
the individual results, justified the decision of amalgamating the data
coming from the different laboratories.

A statistical method based on a simple Tukey\'s Honestly Significant
Difference (HSD) procedure, by utilising the measure MSE obtained from
the analysis of variance**,** at the 95% confidence level, was used to
accept or reject the hypothesis that the average score obtained by a
certain condition was \"significantly\" (in statistical sense) worse
than another one.

The number of votes cast by each listener was: 4 (talkers) x 48
(conditions) = **192**. There were 24 listeners (e.g. 12 male and 12
female) per experiment, organized in a number of sub-groups, e.g. 3
sub-groups made up of 8 persons each, each sub-group of listeners
hearing the sequence in a different order. The number of votes per
condition was: 4 (talkers) x 4 (languages/countries) x 24 (subjects) =
**384**.

A primary elaboration of data was performed for the individual raw data,
averaging Male and Female talkers (see Annex C for Tables of
experimental results).

The following figure was obtained for the \"reference conditions\"
inserted in the tests, i.e. the MNRU (Modulated Noise Reference Unit)
and the \"Direct\" signal. The figure correlates Mean Opinion Scores
(MOS, Yq) with Equivalent Q (dB) values, and is usually considered the
\"transfer curve\" to convert data coming from different countries, i.e.
taking into account cultural, or language, or other differences among
laboratories conducting the \"same\" subjective test.

The effect of errors on the three algorithms, HR FR, EFR, in single
encoding and for quiet conditions is depicted in the following figure.

Single encoding

7.2 Quality under tandeming conditions
--------------------------------------

Tandeming conditions were tested in EP0, EP1 and EP2 error conditions
(see Annex C for tables of results). The following figures clearly
indicate the performance of HR, FR, and EFR when interworking with each
of the other standards (i.e. the combinations of codecs in the figures
should be read: Coder in the Legenda is tandemed with codec in the
abscissa). The following figures were obtained from the experiments that
adopted the Modified IRS input frequency characteristics.

EP0 Tandem

EP1 Tandem

EP2 Tandem

The following figures were obtained from the experiments adopting the
flat input frequency characteristics.

7.3 Quality with far end background noise
-----------------------------------------

Any of the listening laboratories had to report their results from
Exp\#1 or Exp\#2 in a way that the effects of environmental noise, error
pattern and transcoding of the different standards are documented as
DMOS values with their confidence interval (two-tailed t-distribution
with a=0,05).

An individual analysis of data was conducted by each participant
laboratory (see Bibliography). Tables of \"averaged\" results are given
in DMOS, and confidence intervals. An analysis of variance revealed that
conditions, talkers and groups of listeners were highly significant
factors (p\<0,0001) in both experiments.

A global analysis over the laboratories was performed and results were
produced in a similar form to the one produced for global analysis for
Phase 1 of testing (see Annex D for Tables of results).

In Exp. 1 the two laboratories were not significantly different each
other, while in Exp. 2 the LAB factor was a highly significant one. The
Tukey\'s minimum significant difference between DMOS values was around
0,35 in both experiments, such value being used to group conditions that
were not \"statistically\" different in the same \"class\". The
following figures illustrate the results obtained during Phase 2 of
testing.

7.4 Quality enhancement using TFO techniques
--------------------------------------------

The following table summarises the relevant results for the TFO
conditions, i.e. the average improvement achievable with TFO technique
(DMOS, **bold** means significant, **NA** stands for NOT APPLICABLE).
Values were calculated using the Honestly Significant Difference (HSD)
Tukey\'s test at the 95% significance level. The Table was derived from
the experiments that used the flat input characteristics for recording
speech.

The results show that the \"Modified IRS\" input frequency
characteristic was [slightly]{.underline} preferred to the \"flat\" one.

8 Conclusion
============

A number of experimental conditions for the performance characterisation
of GSM interworking standards, including codecs in single, tandem, and
tandem-free operation with and without errors, plus some MNRU conditions
and Direct, have been tested subjectively.

The present document summarised the subjective test results obtained by
CNET, CSELT, DT AG and NORTEL.

The similar or slightly lower quality behaviour showed by the FR codec
in all conditions, in comparison with the HR codec, suggested to
consider the analysis of results from previous exercises pertaining to
those experimental conditions, and to undertake proper investigations on
their reliability. Even if the results seem to be in line with the
content of GSM 06.08, it is not advised to draw any conclusion on the
relative performances of the HR and FR codecs from the limited test
results contained in the present document. The HR characterization test
results (GSM 06.08) provides a more complete picture of the HR
performances in multiple environment. Specifically, GSM 06.08 shows that
the HR is more sensitive than the GSM FR to the type of filtering
(Modified IRS or Linear \'flat\') used for the pre-processing of the
speech samples (see subclause 6.1, table 3 of GSM 06.08).

On grounds of the estimated Mean Opinion Scores, and considering the
statistically significant differences among the simulated network
configurations (computed using the Honestly Significant Difference (HSD)
Tukey\'s test at the 95% significance level), the main positive results
from this test are in general the rather good performance showed by the
EFR and the quantification of improvement achievable by implementing the
proposed TFO schemes, and by replacing the present FR by the EFR codec.

For the HR-HR tandem and EP1, the TFO scheme showed a significant
improvement of 0,7 MOS; the same significant improvement (0.7 MOS) was
obtained by EFR codec for both error-free (EP0) and EP1 (C/I=10 dB)
conditions.

Based on the analysis of experimental results, the following conclusions
can be drawn, in general, for speech mixed to street noise at SNR = 15
dB, or to vehicular noise at SNR = 10 dB:

1\) in single encoding, the Enhanced Full-Rate codec performs
significantly better than the Full-Rate and Half-Rate codecs,
respectively;

2\) in tandem encoding, for EP0 and EP1 error conditions (i.e.
error-free and C/I=10 dB), the ranking order EFR, FR and HR is still
kept, with HR performance significantly worse, while differences between
Full-Rate and Enhanced Full-Rate were in a few cases \"statistically\"
NOT significant;

3\) In tandem encoding, for EP2 error conditions (i.e. C/I= 7 dB), the
performance differences between the codecs decline.
