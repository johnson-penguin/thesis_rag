Introduction
============

To evaluate conformance of a particular implementation, it is necessary
to have a statement of which capabilities and options have been
implemented for a telecommunication specification. Such a statement is
called an Implementation Conformance Statement (ICS).

The present document is 2^nd^ part of a multi-part conformance test
specification for UE and is *valid for 3GPP Release 5 (respectively
Release 15 for 5GS test cases)*. The specification contains the UE IMS
CC capability and the applicability of the UE IMS CC conformance test
cases.

3GPP TS 34.229-1 \[5\]: Internet Protocol (IP) multimedia call control
protocol based on Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) and Session
Description Protocol (SDP); User Equipment (UE) conformance
specification; Part 1: Protocol conformance specification.

**3GPP TS 34.229-2 (the present document): \"Internet Protocol (IP)
multimedia call control protocol based on Session Initiation Protocol
(SIP) and Session Description Protocol (SDP); User Equipment (UE)
conformance specification; Part 2: Implementation Conformance Statement
(ICS) proforma specification\" - current document.**

3GPP TS 34.229-3 \[6\]: \"Internet Protocol (IP) multimedia call control
protocol based on Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) and Session
Description Protocol (SDP); User Equipment (UE) conformance
specification; Part 3: Abstract Test Suites (ATS)\".

3GPP TS 34.229-5 \[95\]: \"Internet Protocol (IP) multimedia call
control protocol based on Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) and Session
Description Protocol (SDP); User Equipment (UE) conformance
specification; Part 5: Protocol conformance specification using 5G
System (5GS)\"

Note: For conformance testing of the UTRAN requirements refer to 3GPP TS
34.123 Parts 1 to 3 \[2\] \[3\] \[4\].

 1 Scope
=======

The present document provides the Implementation Conformance Statement
(ICS) proforma for 3^rd^ Generation User Equipment (UE) supporting the
Internet Protocol (IP) multimedia call control protocol based on Session
Initiation Protocol (SIP) and Session Description Protocol (SDP), in
compliance with the relevant requirements, and in accordance with the
relevant guidance given in ISO/IEC 9646-7 \[8\] and ETS 300 406 \[9\].

The present document also specifies a recommended applicability
statement for the test cases included in TS 34.229-1 \[5\] and TS
34.229-5 \[95\]. These applicability statements are based on the
features implemented in the UE.

The present document is valid for UE implemented according to 3GPP
releases starting from Release 5 up to the Release indicated on the
cover page of the present document.

Also, it is generally assumed that an IMS capable UE is compliant to
GSMA PRD IR.92 \[83\] and GSMA PRD IR.94 \[75\];any update of
requirements in these GSMA PRD documents, which are relevant to the
present document will be handled on a case by case basis, with due
consideration given for grace period to be granted for the UE to comply
to any updated requirements.

completed for an implementation or system becomes an ICS

3.2 Abbreviations
-----------------

For the purposes of the present document, the abbreviations given in
TR 21.905 \[1\] and the following apply. An abbreviation defined in the
present document takes precedence over the definition of the same
abbreviation, if any, in TR 21.905 \[1\].

ICS Implementation Conformance Statement

SCS System Conformance Statement

UEUT User Equipment Under Test

4 Recommended test case applicability
=====================================

The applicability of each individual test is identified in the table 1.
This is just a recommendation based on the purpose for which the test
case was written.

The applicability of every test is formally expressed by the use of
Boolean expression that are based on parameters (ICS) included in annex
A of the present document.

Additional information related to the Test Case (TC), e.g. affecting its
dynamic behaviour or its execution may be provided as well.

The columns in table 1 have the following meaning:

##### Clause {#clause .H6}

The clause column indicates the clause number in TS 34.229-1 \[5\] that
contains the test body.

##### Title {#title .H6}

The title column describes the name of the test.

##### Release {#release .H6}

The release column indicates the earliest release from which each
testcase is applicable, except if otherwise stated of an individual test
case.

NOTE: For the IMS Emergency Service test cases, the 3GPP Release of
UTRAN and GERAN is independent of that indicated in the release column.

##### Applicability {#applicability .H6}

The following notations are used for the applicability column:

R recommended - the test case is recommended

O optional -- the test case is optional

N/A not applicable - in the given context, the test case is not
recommended.

Ci conditional - the test is recommended (\"R\") or not (\"N/A\")
depending on the support of other items. \"i\" is an integer identifying
an unique conditional status expression which is defined immediately
following the table. For nested conditional expressions, the syntax \"IF
\... THEN (IF \... THEN \... ELSE\...) ELSE \...\" is used to avoid
ambiguities.

##### Comments {#comments .H6}

This column contains a verbal description of the condition included in
the applicability column.

NOTE 1: Applicability of test cases 13.2 and 13.3 are currently marked
as FFS. The reason to this is that the contents of the specific messages
sent by the SS (as currently specified within those Call Control test
cases) do not match the contents of those messages as expected by any
specific IMS application known. Further on the test specification
apparently lacks support for certain application specific message
exchanges which are however mandatory for a few specific IMS
applications specified outside of TS 24.229. It is necessary to fully
resolve the problem (by e.g. defining the applications for which the
Call Control test cases would be applicable, possibly specifying the
extensions to the test cases like required by those applications and
creating the corresponding application profiles) before the
applicability statements of Call Control test cases can be unambiguously
defined.

NOTE 2: Either one of the two adjacent test cases, i.e. (19.1.3 or
19.1.3a), (19.3.2 or 19.3.2a), shall be executed.

NOTE 3: This TC can optionally be executed against Rel-8 and onwards
UEs.

NOTE 4: In case the UE supports both GBA and HTTP Digest, GBA shall be
used as XCAP authentication.

NOTE 5: In case the UE supports both GBA and HTTP Digest, HTTP Digest
shall be used as XCAP authentication.

NOTE 6: The TC contains multi-RAT branches not all mandatory in the
scope of the TC. The E-UTRA/EPC branch will be executed always; the TC
will go through any other RAT branch depending on the UE capability.
Execution only of the E-UTRA/EPC branch regardless of the UE
capabilities can also be imposed by setting the IXIT px\_RATComb\_Tested
= EUTRA\_only. For UEs supporting both UTRA and GERAN the TC should be
executed once only for the E-UTRA/EPC and UTRA combination by setting
the px\_RATComb\_Tested = EUTRA\_UTRA.

NOTE 7: This TC can optionally be executed against Rel-9 and onwards
UEs.

########  Annex A (normative): ICS proforma for 3^rd^ Generation User Equipment supporting IP multimedia call control based on SIP and SDP

Notwithstanding the provisions of the copyright related to the text of
the present document, The Organizational Partners of 3GPP grant that
users of the present document may freely reproduce the ICS proforma in
this annex so that it can be used for its intended purposes and may
further publish the completed ICS.

A.1 Guidance for completing the ICS proforma
--------------------------------------------

### A.1.1 Purposes and structure

The purpose of this ICS proforma is to provide a mechanism whereby a
supplier of an implementation of the requirements defined in relevant
specifications may provide information about the implementation in a
standardised manner.

The ICS proforma is subdivided into clauses for the following categories
of information:

\- instructions for completing the ICS proforma;

\- identification of the implementation;

\- identification of the protocol;

\- ICS proforma tables (for example: UE roles specific to additional
capabilities, Major capabilities etc).

### A.1.2 Abbreviations and conventions

This annex does not reflect dynamic conformance requirements but static
ones. In particular, a condition for support of a PDU parameter does not
reflect requirements about the syntax of the PDU (i.e. the presence of a
parameter) but the capability of the implementation to support the
parameter.

In the sending direction, the support of a parameter means that the
implementation is able to send this parameter (but it does not mean that
the implementation always sends it).

In the receiving direction, it means that the implementation supports
the whole semantic of the parameter that is described in the main part
of this specification.

As a consequence, PDU parameter tables in this annex are not the same as
the tables describing the syntax of a PDU in the reference
specification, e.g. RFC 3261 \[15\] tables 2 and 3. It is not rare to
see a parameter which is optional in the syntax but mandatory in
subclause below.

The ICS proforma contained in this annex is comprised of information in
tabular form in accordance with the guidelines presented in
ISO/IEC 9646‑7 \[8\].

##### Item column {#item-column .H6}

The item column contains a number which identifies the item in the
table.

##### Item description column {#item-description-column .H6}

The item description column describes in free text each respective item
(e.g. parameters, timers, etc.). It implicitly means "is \<item
description\> supported by the implementation?".

##### Reference column {#reference-column .H6}

The reference column gives reference to the relevant 3GPP core
specifications and optional IMS profile documents (e.g. GSMA PRD IR.92).

##### Status column {#status-column .H6}

The various statii used in this annex are in accordance with the rules
in table A.1. The status column can also be used for IMS profile
documents.

Table A.1: Key to status codes

  --------------- ----------------------- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Status code     Status name             Meaning
  m               mandatory               the capability shall be supported. It is a static view of the fact that the conformance requirements related to the capability in the reference specification are mandatory requirements. This does not mean that a given behaviour shall always be observed (this would be a dynamic view), but that it shall be observed when the implementation is placed in conditions where the conformance requirements from the reference specification compel it to do so. For instance, if the support for a parameter in a sent PDU is mandatory, it does not mean that it shall always be present, but that it shall be present according to the description of the behaviour in the reference specification (dynamic conformance requirement).
  o               optional                the capability may or may not be supported. It is an implementation choice.
  n/a             not applicable          it is impossible to use the capability. No answer in the support column is required.
  x               prohibited (excluded)   It is not allowed to use the capability. This is more common for a profile.
  c \<integer\>   conditional             the requirement on the capability (\"m\", \"o\", \"n/a\" or \"x\") depends on the support of other optional or conditional items. \<integer\> is the identifier of the conditional expression.
  o.\<integer\>   qualified optional      for mutually exclusive or selectable options from a set. \<integer\> is the identifier of the group of options, and the logic of selection of the options.
  --------------- ----------------------- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

##### Release column {#release-column .H6}

The release column indicates the earliest release from which the
capability or option is relevant.

##### Mnemonic column {#mnemonic-column .H6}

The Mnemonic column contains mnemonic identifiers for each item.

##### Support column {#support-column .H6}

The support column shall be filled in by the supplier of the
implementation. The following common notations, defined in
ISO/IEC 9646‑7 \[8\], are used for the support column:

Y or y supported by the implementation

N or n not supported by the implementation

N/A, n/a or ‑ no answer required (allowed only if the status is N/A,
directly or after evaluation of a conditional status)

##### References to items {#references-to-items .H6}

For each possible item answer (answer in the support column) within the
ICS proforma there exists a unique reference, used, for example, in the
conditional expressions. It is defined as the table identifier, followed
by a solidus character "/", followed by the item number in the table.

EXAMPLE: A.5/4 is the reference to the answer of item 4 in table A.5.

### A.1.3 Instructions for completing the ICS proforma

The supplier of the implementation may complete the ICS proforma in each
of the spaces provided. More detailed instructions are given at the
beginning of the different clauses of the ICS proforma.

A.2 Identification of the User Equipment
----------------------------------------

Identification of the User Equipment should be filled in so as to
provide as much detail as possible regarding version numbers and
configuration options.

The product supplier information and client information should both be
filled in if they are different.

A person who can answer queries regarding information supplied in the
ICS should be named as the contact person.
