8.7 Measurements Performance Requirements
-----------------------------------------

Unless explicitly stated:

\- Reported measurements shall be within defined range in 90 % of the
cases.

\- Measurement channel is 12.2 kbps as defined in Annex C, sub-clause
C.3.1. This measurement channel is used both in active cell and cells to
be measured.

\- Physical channels used as defined in Annex E.

\- Cell 1 is the active cell.

\- Single task reporting.

\- Power control is active.

Note: For the UE which supports both Band III and Band IX operating
frequencies, the measurement performance requirements for Band III shall
apply to the multi-band UE.

When DRX is configured in state CELL\_FACH, the accuracy specified for
idle mode reselections in chapter 4 of TS25.133\[2\] is applicable to UE
measurements.

NOTE: The requirements for Band XXXII are applicable only with dual band
configuration (e.g., DB-DC-HSDPA or dual band 4C-HSDPA).

### 8.7.1 CPICH RSCP

#### 8.7.1.1 Intra frequency measurements accuracy

##### 8.7.1.1.1 Absolute accuracy requirement

##### 8.7.1.1.1.1 Definition and applicability {#definition-and-applicability .H6}

The absolute accuracy of CPICH RSCP is defined as the CPICH RSCP
measured from one cell compared to the actual CPICH RSCP power from same
cell.

The requirements and this test apply to all types of UTRA for the FDD
UE.

##### 8.7.1.1.1.2 Minimum Requirements {#minimum-requirements .H6}

The accuracy requirements in table 8.7.1.1.1.1 are valid under the
following conditions:

CPICH\_RSCP1\|~dBm~.according to Annex L.3.1 for a corresponding Band

##### 8.7.1.1.1.3 Test purpose {#test-purpose .H6}

The purpose of this test is to verify that the CPICH RSCP absolute
measurement accuracy is within the specified limits in clause
8.7.1.1.1.2. This measurement is for handover evaluation, DL open loop
power control, UL open loop control and for the calculation of pathloss.

##### 8.7.1.1.1.4 Method of test {#method-of-test .H6}

##### 8.7.1.1.1.4.1 Initial conditions {#initial-conditions .H6}

Test environment: normal, TL/VL, TL/VH, TH/VL, TH/VH; see clauses G.2.1
and G.2.2.

Frequencies to be tested: mid range; see clause G.2.4.

In this case all cells are on the same frequency. CPICH RSCP intra
frequency absolute accuracy requirements are tested by using test
parameters in table 8.7.1.1.1.2.

##### 8.7.1.1.1.4.2 Procedure {#procedure .H6}

1\) A call is set up according to the test procedure specified in TS
34.108 \[3\] clause 7.3.2. The RF parameters for Test 1 are set up
according to table 8.7.1.1.1.4.

2\) SS shall transmit MEASUREMENT CONTROL message.

3\) UE shall transmit periodically MEASUREMENT REPORT messages.

4\) SS shall check CPICH\_RSCP value in MEASUREMENT REPORT messages.
CPICH RSCP power of Cell 1 and Cell 2 reported by UE is compared to
actual CPICH RSCP power for each MEASUREMENT REPORT message.

5\) SS shall check MEASUREMENT REPORT messages transmitted by UE until
statistical significance according to Annex F.6.2.8 is achieved.

6\) The RF parameters are set up according to table 8.7.1.1.1.4 for Test
2. While RF parameters are being set up, MEASUREMENT REPORT messages
from UE are ignored. SS shall wait for additional 1s and ignore the
MEASUREMENT REPORT messages during this period. Then, step 4) and 5)
above are repeated.

7\) The RF parameters are set up according to table 8.7.1.1.1.4 for Test
3. While RF parameters are being set up, MEASUREMENT REPORT messages
from UE are ignored. SS shall wait for additional 1s and ignore the
MEASUREMENT REPORT messages during this period. Then, step 4) and 5)
above are repeated.

8\) The SS shall transmit RRC CONNECTION RELEASE message.

9\) UE shall transmit RRC CONNECTION RELEASE COMPLETE message.

##### Specific Message Contents {#specific-message-contents .H6}

All messages indicated above shall use the same content as described in
the default message content in clause 9 of 34.108 \[3\], with the

NOTE 1: If the above Test Requirement differs from the Minimum
Requirement then the Test Tolerance applied for this test is non-zero.
The Test Tolerance for this test is defined in clause F.2 and the
explanation of how the Minimum Requirement has been relaxed by the Test
Tolerance is given in clause F.4.

NOTE 2: This value applies for a UE complying to release 5 or later. The
corresponding value for a pre-release 5 UE is CPICH\_RSCP\_0.

##### 8.7.1.1.2 Relative accuracy requirement

##### 8.7.1.1.2.1 Definition and applicability {#definition-and-applicability-1 .H6}

The relative accuracy of CPICH RSCP is defined as the CPICH RSCP
measured from one cell compared to the CPICH RSCP measured from another
cell on the same frequency.

The requirements and this test apply to all types of UTRA for the FDD
UE.

##### 8.7.1.1.2.2 Minimum Requirements {#minimum-requirements-1 .H6}

The accuracy requirements in table 8.7.1.1.2.1 are valid under the
following conditions:

CPICH\_RSCP1,2\|~dBm~ according to Annex B.3.2 for a corresponding Band.

$\left| \text{CPICH}_{\text{RSCP}}1|_{\text{in}\ \text{dBm}} - \text{CPICH}_{\text{RSCP}}2|_{\text{in}\ \text{dBm}} \right| \leq \text{20}\text{dB}$

$\frac{I_{o}}{\left( {\hat{I}}_{\text{or}} \right)}|_{\text{in}\ \text{dB}}\  - \ \left( \frac{\text{CPICH}_{}}{I_{\text{or}}} \right)|_{\text{in}\ \text{dB}} \leq \text{20}\text{dB}$

The normative reference for this requirement is TS 25.133 \[2\] clauses
9.1.1.1.2 and A.9.1.1.2.

##### 8.7.1.1.2.3 Test purpose {#test-purpose-1 .H6}

The purpose of this test is to verify that the CPICH RSCP relative
measurement accuracy is within the specified limits in clause
8.7.1.1.2.2. This measurement is for handover evaluation, DL open loop
power control, UL open loop control and for the calculation of pathloss.

##### 8.7.1.1.2.4 Method of test {#method-of-test-1 .H6}

##### 8.7.1.1.2.4.1 Initial conditions {#initial-conditions-1 .H6}

Test environment: normal, TL/VL, TL/VH, TH/VL, TH/VH; see clauses G.2.1
and G.2.2.

Frequencies to be tested: mid range; see clause G.2.4.

In this case all cells are on the same frequency. CPICH RSCP intra
frequency relative accuracy requirements are tested by using test
parameters in table 8.7.1.1.1.2.

##### 8.7.1.1.2.4.2 Procedure {#procedure-1 .H6}

1\) A call is set up according to the test procedure specified in TS
34.108 \[3\] clause 7.3.2. The RF parameters for Test 1 are set up
according to table 8.7.1.1.2.3.

2\) SS shall transmit MEASUREMENT CONTROL message.

3\) UE shall transmit periodically MEASUREMENT REPORT messages.

4\) SS shall check CPICH\_RSCP value of Cell 1 and Cell 2 in MEASUREMENT
REPORT messages. CPICH RSCP power value measured from Cell 1 is compared
to CPICH RSCP power value measured from Cell 2 for each MEASUREMENT
REPORT message.

5\) The result of step 4) is compared to actual power level difference
of CPICH RSCP of Cell 1 and Cell 2.

6\) SS shall check MEASUREMENT REPORT messages transmitted by UE until
statistical significance according to Annex F.6.2.8 is achieved.

7\) The RF parameters are set up according to table 8.7.1.1.2.3 for Test
2. While RF parameters are being set up, MEASUREMENT REPORT messages
from UE are ignored. SS shall wait for additional 1s and ignore the
MEASUREMENT REPORT messages during this period. Then, steps 4), 5) and
6) above are repeated.

8\) The RF parameters are set up according to table 8.7.1.1.2.3 for Test
3. While RF parameters are being set up, MEASUREMENT REPORT messages
from UE are ignored. SS shall wait for additional 1s and ignore the
MEASUREMENT REPORT messages during this period. Then, steps 4), 5) and
6) above are repeated.

9\) The SS shall transmit RRC CONNECTION RELEASE message.

10\) UE shall transmit RRC CONNECTION RELEASE COMPLETE message.

##### Specific Message Contents  {#specific-message-contents-1 .H6}

All messages indicated above shall use the same content as described in
the default message content in clause 9 of 34.108 \[3\], with the
following exceptions:

MEASUREMENT CONTROL message for Intra frequency measurement in clause
8.7.1.1.1.4.2 is used.

##### MEASUREMENT REPORT message for Intra frequency test cases {#measurement-report-message-for-intra-frequency-test-cases-1 .H6}

This message is common for all intra frequency test cases in clause 8.7
and is described in Annex I.

The normative reference for this requirement is TS 25.133 \[2\] clauses
9.1.1.2.1 and A.9.1.1.2.

##### 8.7.1.2.1.3 Test purpose {#test-purpose-2 .H6}

The purpose of this test is to verify that the CPICH RSCP relative
measurement accuracy is within the specified limits in clause
8.7.1.2.1.2. This measurement is for handover evaluation, DL open loop
power control, UL open loop control and for the calculation of pathloss.

##### 8.7.1.2.1.4 Method of test {#method-of-test-2 .H6}

##### 8.7.1.2.1.4.1 Initial conditions {#initial-conditions-2 .H6}

Test environment: normal, TL/VL, TL/VH, TH/VL, TH/VH; see clauses G.2.1
and G.2.2.

Frequencies to be tested: mid range; see clause G.2.4.

In this case both cells are on different frequencies.

For UEs that require compressed mode, compressed mode is applied. The
gap length is 7, detailed definition is in clause C.5, set 1 of table
C.5.2 except for TGRRC and TGCFN. TGPRC and TGCFN shall set to
\"Infinity\" and \"(Current CFN + (256 -- TTI/10msec))mod 256\".

For UEs that do not require compressed mode, compressed mode is not
applied and therefore no Physical Channel Reconfiguration message will
be sent.

CPICH RSCP inter frequency relative accuracy requirements are tested by
using test parameters in table 8.7.1.2.1.2.

##### 8.7.1.2.1.4.2 Procedure {#procedure-2 .H6}

1\) A call is set up according to the test procedure specified in TS
34.108 \[3\] clause 7.3.2. The RF parameters for Test 1 are set up
according to table 8.7.1.2.1.4.

2\) If compressed mode is required, SS shall transmit PHYSICAL CHANNEL
RECONFIGURATION message. Otherwise, go to step 4.

3\) UE shall transmit PHYSICAL CHANNEL RECONFIGURATION COMPLETE message.

4\) SS shall transmit MEASUREMENT CONTROL message for intra frequency
measurement and transmit MEASUREMENT CONTROL message for inter frequency
measurement.

5\) UE shall transmit periodically MEASUREMENT REPORT messages.

6\) SS shall check CPICH\_RSCP value of Cell 1 and Cell 2 in MEASUREMENT
REPORT messages. CPICH RSCP power value measured from Cell 1 is compared
to CPICH RSCP power value measured from Cell 2 for each MEASUREMENT
REPORT message.

7\) The result of step 6) is compared to actual power level difference
of CPICH RSCP of Cell 1 and Cell 2.

8\) SS shall check MEASUREMENT REPORT messages transmitted by UE until
statistical significance according to Annex F.6.2.8 is achieved.

9\) The RF parameters are set up according to table 8.7.1.2.1.4 for Test
2. While RF parameters are being set up, MEASUREMENT REPORT messages
from UE are ignored. SS shall wait for additional 1s and ignore the
MEASUREMENT REPORT messages during this period. Then, steps 6), 7) and
8) above are repeated.

10\) The SS shall transmit RRC CONNECTION RELEASE message.

11\) UE shall transmit RRC CONNECTION RELEASE COMPLETE message.

##### Specific Message Contents {#specific-message-contents-2 .H6}

All messages indicated above shall use the same content as described in
the default message content in clause 9 of 34.108 \[3\], with the
following exceptions:

##### PHYSICAL CHANNEL RECONFIGURATION message for Inter frequency measurement (step 1): {#physical-channel-reconfiguration-message-for-inter-frequency-measurement-step-1 .H6}

##### 8.7.2.1.1.4.2 Procedure {#procedure-3 .H6}

1\) A call is set up according to the test procedure specified in TS
34.108 \[3\] subclause 7.3.2. The RF parameters for Test 1 are set up
according to table 8.7.2.1.1.5.

2\) SS shall transmit MEASUREMENT CONTROL message.

3\) UE shall transmit periodically MEASUREMENT REPORT messages.

4\) SS shall check CPICH\_Ec/No value in MEASUREMENT REPORT messages.
According to table 8.7.2.1.1.3 the SS calculates CPICH\_Ec/Io power
ratio of Cell 1, which is compared to the actual CPICH Ec/Io power ratio
from the same cell for each MEASUREMENT REPORT message.

5\) SS shall check MEASUREMENT REPORT messages transmitted by UE until
statistical significance according to Annex F.6.2.8 is achieved.

6\) The RF parameters are set up according to table 8.7.2.1.1.5 for Test
2. While RF parameters are being set up, MEASUREMENT REPORT messages
from UE are ignored. SS shall wait for additional 1s and ignore the
MEASUREMENT REPORT messages during this period. Then, step 4) and 5)
above are repeated.

7\) The RF parameters are set up according to table 8.7.2.1.1.5 for Test
3. While RF parameters are being set up, MEASUREMENT REPORT messages
from UE are ignored. SS shall wait for additional 1s and ignore the
MEASUREMENT REPORT messages during this period. Then, step 4) and 5)
above are repeated.

8\) The SS shall transmit RRC CONNECTION RELEASE message.

9\) UE shall transmit RRC CONNECTION RELEASE COMPLETE message.

NOTE: If the above Test Requirement differs from the Minimum Requirement
then the Test Tolerance applied for this test is non-zero. The Test
Tolerance for this test is defined in clause F.2 and the explanation of
how the Minimum Requirement has been relaxed by the Test Tolerance is
given in clause F.4.

##### 8.7.2.1.2 Relative accuracy requirement

##### 8.7.2.1.2.1 Definition and applicability {#definition-and-applicability-4 .H6}

The relative accuracy of CPICH Ec/Io is defined as the CPICH Ec/Io
measured from one cell compared to the CPICH Ec/Io measured from another
cell on the same frequency.

The requirements and this test apply to all types of UTRA for the FDD
UE.

##### 8.7.2.1.2.2 Minimum Requirements {#minimum-requirements-4 .H6}

The accuracy requirements in table 8.7.2.1.2.1 are valid under the
following conditions:

CPICH\_RSCP1,2\|~dBm~ according to Annex B.3.5 for a corresponding Band

$\left| \text{CPICH}_{\text{RSCP}}1|_{\text{in}\ \text{dBm}} - \text{CPICH}_{\text{RSCP}}2|_{\text{in}\ \text{dBm}} \right| \leq \text{20}\text{dB}$

$\frac{I_{o}}{\left( {\hat{I}}_{\text{or}} \right)}|_{\text{in}\ \text{dB}}\  - \ \left( \frac{\text{CPICH}_{}}{I_{\text{or}}} \right)|_{\text{in}\ \text{dB}} \leq \text{20}\text{dB}$

The normative reference for this requirement is TS 25.133 \[2\] clauses
9.1.2.1.2 and A.9.1.2.2.

##### 8.7.2.1.2.3 Test purpose {#test-purpose-4 .H6}

The purpose of this test is to verify that the CPICH Ec/Io relative
measurement accuracy is within the specified limits in clause
8.7.2.1.2.2. This measurement is for Cell selection/re-selection and for
handover evaluation.

##### 8.7.2.1.2.4 Method of test {#method-of-test-4 .H6}

##### 8.7.2.1.2.4.1 Initial conditions {#initial-conditions-4 .H6}

Test environment: normal, TL/VL, TL/VH, TH/VL, TH/VH; see clauses G.2.1
and G.2.2.

Frequencies to be tested: mid range; see clause G.2.4.

In this case all cells are in the same frequency. CPICH Ec/Io intra
frequency relative accuracy requirements are tested by using test
parameters in table 8.7.2.1.1.2.

##### 8.7.2.1.2.4.2 Procedure {#procedure-4 .H6}

1\) A call is set up according to the test procedure specified in TS
34.108 \[3\] subclause 7.3.2. The RF parameters for Test 1 are set up
according to table 8.7.2.1.2.3.

2\) SS shall transmit MEASUREMENT CONTROL message.

3\) UE shall transmit periodically MEASUREMENT REPORT messages.

4\) SS shall check CPICH\_Ec/No value of Cell 1 and Cell 2 in
MEASUREMENT REPORT messages. According to table 8.7.2.1.1.3 the SS
calculates CPICH\_Ec/Io power ratio of Cell 1 and Cell 2. CPICH\_Ec/Io
power ratio value measured from Cell 1 is compared to CPICH\_Ec/Io power
ratio value measured from Cell 2 for each MEASUREMENT REPORT message.

5\) The result of step 4) is compared to actual power level difference
of CPICH\_Ec/Io of Cell 1 and Cell 2.

6\) SS shall check MEASUREMENT REPORT messages transmitted by UE until
statistical significance according to Annex F.6.2.8 is achieved.

7\) The RF parameters are set up according to table 8.7.2.1.2.3 for Test
2. While RF parameters are being set up, MEASUREMENT REPORT messages
from UE are ignored. SS shall wait for additional 1s and ignore the
MEASUREMENT REPORT messages during this period. Then, steps 4), 5) and
6) above are repeated.

8\) The RF parameters are set up according to table 8.7.2.1.2.3 for Test
3. While RF parameters are being set up, MEASUREMENT REPORT messages
from UE are ignored. SS shall wait for additional 1s and ignore the
MEASUREMENT REPORT messages during this period. Then, steps 4), 5) and
6) above are repeated.

9\) The SS shall transmit RRC CONNECTION RELEASE message.

10\) UE shall transmit RRC CONNECTION RELEASE COMPLETE message.

##### Specific Message Contents  {#specific-message-contents-4 .H6}

All messages indicated above shall use the same content as described in
the default message content in clause 9 of 34.108 \[3\], with the
following exceptions:

MEASUREMENT CONTROL message for Intra frequency measurement in clause
8.7.2.1.1.4.2 is used.

##### MEASUREMENT REPORT message for Intra frequency test cases {#measurement-report-message-for-intra-frequency-test-cases-3 .H6}

This message is common for all intra frequency test cases in clause 8.7
and is described in Annex I.

NOTE: If the above Test Requirement differs from the Minimum Requirement
then the Test Tolerance applied for this test is non-zero. The Test
Tolerance for this test is defined in clause F.2 and the explanation of
how the Minimum Requirement has been relaxed by the Test Tolerance is
given in clause F.4.

#### 8.7.2.2 Inter frequency measurement accuracy

Void

##### 8.7.2.2.2 Relative accuracy requirement

##### 8.7.2.2.2.1 Definition and applicability {#definition-and-applicability-5 .H6}

The relative accuracy of CPICH Ec/Io in the inter frequency case is
defined as the CPICH Ec/Io measured from one cell compared to the CPICH
Ec/Io measured from another cell on a different frequency.

The relative accuracy is defined using the lower CPICH\_Ec/Io of cell 1
and cell 2.

The requirements and this test apply to all types of UTRA for the FDD
UE.

##### 8.7.2.2.2.2 Minimum Requirements {#minimum-requirements-5 .H6}

The accuracy requirements in table 8.7.2.2.2.1 are valid under the
following conditions:

CPICH\_RSCP1\|~dBm~ according to Annex L.3.7 for a corresponding Band

$\left| \text{CPICH}_{\text{RSCP}}1|_{\text{in}\ \text{dBm}} - \text{CPICH}_{\text{RSCP}}2|_{\text{in}\ \text{dBm}} \right| \leq \text{20}\text{dB}$

\| Channel 1\_Io\|~dBm/3.84\ MHz~ ‑Channel 2\_Io\|~dBm/3.84\ MHz~ \| ≤
20 dB.

$\frac{I_{o}}{\left( {\hat{I}}_{\text{or}} \right)}|_{\text{in}\ \text{dB}}\  - \ \left( \frac{\text{CPICH}_{}}{I_{\text{or}}} \right)|_{\text{in}\ \text{dB}} \leq \text{20}\text{dB}$

The normative reference for this requirement is TS 25.133 \[2\] clauses
9.1.2.2.2 and A.9.1.2.2.

##### 8.7.2.2.2.3 Test purpose {#test-purpose-5 .H6}

The purpose of this test is to verify that the CPICH Ec/Io relative
measurement accuracy is within the specified limits in clause
8.7.2.2.2.2. This measurement is for Cell selection/re-selection and for
handover evaluation.

##### 8.7.2.2.2.4 Method of test {#method-of-test-5 .H6}

##### 8.7.2.2.2.4.1 Initial conditions {#initial-conditions-5 .H6}

Test environment: normal, TL/VL, TL/VH, TH/VL, TH/VH; see clauses G.2.1
and G.2.2.

Frequencies to be tested: mid range; see clause G.2.4.

In this case both cells are on different frequencies.

For UEs that require compressed mode, compressed mode is applied. The
gap length is 7, detailed definition is in clause C.5, set 1 of table
C.5.2 except for TGRRC and TGCFN. TGPRC and TGCFN shall set to
\"Infinity\" and \"(Current CFN + (256 -- TTI/10msec)) mod 256\".

For UEs that do not require compressed mode, compressed mode is not
applied and therefore no Physical Channel Reconfiguration message will
be sent.

CPICH Ec/Io inter frequency relative accuracy requirements are tested by
using test parameters in table 8.7.2.2.2.2.

##### 8.7.2.2.2.4.2 Procedure {#procedure-5 .H6}

1\) A call is set up according to the test procedure specified in TS
34.108 \[3\] subclause 7.3.2. The RF parameters for Test 1 are set up
according to table 8.7.2.2.2.4.

2\) If compressed mode is required, SS shall transmit PHYSICAL CHANNEL
RECONFIGURATION message. Otherwise, go to step 4.

3\) UE shall transmit PHYSICAL CHANNEL RECONFIGURATION COMPLETE message.

4\) SS shall transmit a MEASUREMENT CONTROL message for intra frequency
measurement and transmit another MEASUREMENT CONTROL message for inter
frequency measurement.

5\) UE shall transmit periodically MEASUREMENT REPORT messages.

6\) SS shall check CPICH\_Ec/No value of Cell 1 and Cell 2 in
MEASUREMENT REPORT messages. According to table 8.7.2.1.1.3 the SS
calculates CPICH\_Ec/Io power ratio of Cell 1 and Cell 2. CPICH\_Ec/Io
power ratio measured from Cell 1 is compared to CPICH\_Ec/Io power value
measured from Cell 2 for each MEASUREMENT REPORT message.

7\) The result of step 6) is compared to actual power level difference
of CPICH\_Ec/Io of Cell 1 and Cell 2.

8\) SS shall check MEASUREMENT REPORT messages transmitted by UE until
statistical significance according to Annex F.6.2.8 is achieved.

9\) The RF parameters are set up according to table 8.7.2.2.2.4 for Test
2. While RF parameters are being set up, MEASUREMENT REPORT messages
from UE are ignored. SS shall wait for additional 1s and ignore the
MEASUREMENT REPORT messages during this period. Then, steps 6), 7) and
8) above are repeated.

10\) The RF parameters are set up according to table 8.7.2.2.2.4 for
Test 3. While RF parameters are being set up, MEASUREMENT REPORT
messages from UE are ignored. SS shall wait for additional 1s and ignore
the MEASUREMENT REPORT messages during this period. Then, steps 6), 7)
and 8) above are repeated.

11\) The SS shall transmit RRC CONNECTION RELEASE message.

12\) UE shall transmit RRC CONNECTION RELEASE COMPLETE message.

The normative reference for this requirement is TS 25.133 \[2\] clause
9.1.3.1.

##### 8.7.3.1.3 Test purpose

The purpose of this test is to verify that the UTRA Carrier RSSI
measurement is within the specified limits. This measurement is for
inter-frequency handover evaluation.

##### 8.7.3.1.4 Method of test

##### 8.7.3.1.4.1 Initial conditions {#initial-conditions-6 .H6}

Test environment: normal, TL/VL, TL/VH, TH/VL, TH/VH; see clauses G.2.1
and G.2.2.

Frequencies to be tested: mid range; see clause G.2.4.

In this case both cells are on different frequencies.

For UEs that require compressed mode, compressed mode is applied. The
gap length is 7, detailed definition is in clause C.5, Set 1 of table
C.5.2 except for TGRRC and TGCFN. TGPRC and TGCFN shall set to
\"Infinity\" and \"(Current CFN + (256 -- TTI/10msec)) mod 256\".

For UEs that do not require compressed mode, compressed mode is not
applied and therefore no Physical Channel Reconfiguration message will
be sent.

UTRA Carrier RSSI absolute accuracy requirements are tested by using
test parameters in table 8.7.3.1.2.

##### 8.7.3.1.4.2 Procedure {#procedure-6 .H6}

1\) A call is set up according to the test procedure specified in TS
34.108 \[3\] subclause 7.3.2. The RF parameters for Test 1 are set up
according to table 8.7.3.1.2.

2\) If compressed mode is required, SS shall transmit PHYSICAL CHANNEL
RECONFIGURATION message. Otherwise, go to step 4.

3\) UE shall transmit PHYSICAL CHANNEL RECONFIGURATION COMPLETE message.

4\) SS shall transmit MEASUREMENT CONTROL message.

5\) UE shall transmit periodically MEASUREMENT REPORT messages.

6\) SS shall check UTRA carrier RSSI value of Channel 2 in MEASUREMENT
REPORT messages. UTRA carrier RSSI power of Channel 2 reported by UE is
compared to actual UTRA Carrier RSSI value of Channel 2 for each
MEASUREMENT REPORT message.

7\) SS shall check MEASUREMENT REPORT messages transmitted by UE until
statistical significance according to Annex F.6.2.8 is achieved.

8\) The RF parameters are set up according to table 8.7.3.1.2 for Test
2. While RF parameters are being set up, MEASUREMENT REPORT messages
from UE are ignored. SS shall wait for additional 1s and ignore the
MEASUREMENT REPORT messages during this period. Then, step 6) and 7)
above are repeated.

9\) The RF parameters are set up according to table 8.7.3.1.2 for Test
3. While RF parameters are being set up, MEASUREMENT REPORT messages
from UE are ignored. SS shall wait for additional 1s and ignore the
MEASUREMENT REPORT messages during this period. Then, step 6) and 7)
above are repeated.

10\) The SS shall transmit RRC CONNECTION RELEASE message.

11\) UE shall transmit RRC CONNECTION RELEASE COMPLETE message.

NOTE: If the above Test Requirement differs from the Minimum Requirement
then the Test Tolerance applied for this test is non-zero. The Test
Tolerance for this test is defined in clause F.2 and the explanation of
how the Minimum Requirement has been relaxed by the Test Tolerance is
given in clause F.4.

#### 8.7.3.2 Relative measurement accuracy requirement

##### 8.7.3.2.1 Definition and applicability

The relative accuracy requirement is defined as the UTRA Carrier RSSI
measured from one frequency compared to the UTRA Carrier RSSI measured
from another frequency.

The requirements and this test apply for Release 6 and later releases to
all types of UTRA for the FDD UE.

##### 8.7.3.2.2 Minimum Requirements

The accuracy requirements in table 8.7.3.2.1 are valid under the
following condition:

\|Channel 1\_Io\|~dBm/3.84\ MHz~ ‑ \|Channel 2\_Io\|~dBm/3.84\ MHz~ \<
20 dB.

1\) A call is set up according to the test procedure specified in TS
34.108 \[3\] clause 7.3.2. The RF parameters for Test 1 are set up
according to table 8.7.3.2.3.

2\) SS shall transmit PHYSICAL CHANNEL RECONFIGURATION message.

3\) UE shall transmit PHYSICAL CHANNEL RECONFIGURATION COMPLETE message.

4\) SS shall transmit MEASUREMENT CONTROL message. The SS shall wait 6.8
seconds to allow UE to be ready for inter frequency measurements.

5\) UE shall transmit periodically MEASUREMENT REPORT messages.

6\) SS shall check UTRA carrier RSSI value of Channel 2 and Channel 3 in
MEASUREMENT REPORT messages. UTRA carrier RSSI power value measured from
Channel 3 is compared to UTRA carrier RSSI power value measured from
Channel 2 for each MEASUREMENT REPORT message.

7\) The result of step 6) is compared to actual power level difference
of UTRA Carrier RSSI of Channel 3 and Channel 2.

8\) SS shall check MEASUREMENT REPORT messages transmitted by UE until
statistical significance according to Annex F.6.2.8 is achieved.

9\) The RF parameters are set up according to table 8.7.3.2.3 for Test
2. While RF parameters are being set up, MEASUREMENT REPORT messages
from UE are ignored. SS shall wait for additional 1s and ignore the
MEASUREMENT REPORT messages during this period. Then, steps 6), 7) and
8) above are repeated.

10\) The RF parameters are set up according to table 8.7.3.2.3 for Test
3. While RF parameters are being set up, MEASUREMENT REPORT messages
from UE are ignored. SS shall wait for additional 1s and ignore the
MEASUREMENT REPORT messages during this period. Then, steps 6), 7) and

NOTE: If the above Test Requirement differs from the Minimum Requirement
then the Test Tolerance applied for this test is non-zero. The Test
Tolerance for this test is defined in clause F.2 and the explanation of
how the Minimum Requirement has been relaxed by the Test Tolerance is
given in clause F.4.

### 8.7.3A GSM Carrier RSSI

#### 8.7.3A.1 Definition and applicability

The GSM carrier RSSI measurement is used for handover between UTRAN and
GSM.

The requirements and this test apply to the combined FDD and GSM UE.

#### 8.7.3A.2 Minimum Requirements

The UE shall meet the measurement accuracy requirements stated for RXLEV
below, when the given measurement time allows the UE to take at least 3
GSM carrier RSSI samples per GSM carrier in the monitored set during the
measurement period.

The absolute accuracy shall be as follows:

The R.M.S received signal level at the receiver input shall be measured
by the UE and the BSS over the full range of ‑110 dBm to ‑48 dBm with an
absolute accuracy of ±4 dB from ‑110 dBm to ‑70 dBm under normal
conditions and ±6 dB over the full range under both normal and extreme
conditions. The R.M.S received signal level at the receiver input shall
be measured by the UE above -48 dBm up to -38 dBm with an absolute
accuracy of ± 9 dB under both normal and extreme conditions.

If the received signal level falls below the reference sensitivity level
for the type of UE or BSS, then the measured level shall be within the
range allowing for the absolute accuracy specified above. In case the
upper limit of this range is below the reference sensitivity level for
the type of UE or BSS, then the upper limit shall be considered as equal
to the reference sensitivity level.

The relative accuracy shall be as follows:

If signals of level x1 and x2 dBm are received (where x1 ≤ x2) and
levels y1 and y2 dBm respectively are measured, if x2 ‑ x1 \< 20 dB and
x1 is not below the reference sensitivity level, then y1 and y2 shall be
such that:

(x2 ‑ x1) ‑ a ≤ y2 ‑ y1 ≤ (x2 ‑ x1 + b) if the measurements are on the
same or on different RF channel within the same frequency band;

and

(x2 ‑ x1 ) ‑ c ≤ y2 ‑ y1 ≤( x2 ‑ x1 + d) if the measurements are on
different frequency bands:

a, b, c and d are in dB and depend on the value of x1 as follows:

  ------------------------- --- --- --- ---
                            a   b   c   d
  x1 ≥ s+14, x2\< -48 dBm   2   2   4   4
  s+14 \> x1 ≥ s+1          3   2   5   4
  s+1 \> x1                 4   2   6   4
                                        
  ------------------------- --- --- --- ---

For single band MS or BTS and measurements between ARFCN in the same
band for a multiband

MS or BTS;

s = reference sensitivity level as specified in 3GPP TS 05.05 \[28\] for
R99 and in 3GPP TS 45.005 \[29\] for Rel-4 and later releases.

For measurements between ARFCN in different bands;

s = the reference sensitivity level as specified in \[28\] and \[29\]
for the band including x1.

At extreme temperature conditions an extra 2 dB shall be added to c and
d in above table.

The selectivity of the received signal level measurement shall be as
follows:

‑ for adjacent (200 kHz) channel ≥ 16 dB;

‑ for adjacent (400 kHz) channel ≥ 48 dB;

‑ for adjacent (600 kHz) channel ≥ 56 dB.

The selectivity shall be met using random, continuous, GSM‑modulated
signals with the wanted signal at the level 20 dB above the reference
sensitivity level.

The reporting range and mapping specified for RXLEV in TS 05.08\[20\]
for R99 and in TS 45.008 \[30\] for Rel-4 and later releases shall
apply.

The rate of correct measurements observed during repeated tests shall be
at least 90%.

The normative reference for this requirement is:

For R99: TS 25.133 \[2\] clause 8.1.2.5 and 9.1.4 and TS 05.08 \[20\]
clause 8.1.2.

For Rel-4 and later releases: TS 25.133 \[2\] clause 8.1.2.5 and 9.1.4
and TS 45.008 \[30\] clause 8.1.2.

#### 8.7.3A.3 Test purpose

*The purpose of this test is to verify that the GSM Carrier RSSI
measurement accuracy in CELL\_DCH state, for UE that* needs compressed
mode to perform GSM measurements, *is within the specified limits.* This
measurement is for UTRAN to GSM handover evaluation.

#### 8.7.3A.4 Method of test

##### 8.7.3A.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: normal, TL/VL, TH/VH; see clauses G.2.1 and G.2.2.

Frequencies to be tested: mid range; see clause G.2.4.

In the test in Cell\_DCH state compressed mode with purpose \"GSM
Carrier RSSI Measurement\" is applied to measure on GSM. The gap length
is 7, *detailed definition is in clause C.5, Set 2 of table C.5.2 except
for TGPRC and TGCFN. TGPRC and TGCFN shall set to \'\"Infinity\" and
\"(Current CFN + (256 -- TTI/10msec))mod 256\"*. Table 8.7.3A.1 defines
the limits of signal strengths and code powers on the UMTS FDD cell,
where the requirement is applicable. In the measurement control
information it is indicated to the UE that periodic reporting of the GSM
RSSI measurement.

The requirements are also applicable for a UE not requiring compressed
mode, in which case no compressed mode pattern should be sent for the
parameters specified in table 8.7.3A.1.

NOTE 1: The following BCCH ARFCN's specified for FDD Band VIII provide
enough gap for a UMTS cell and its AWGN to be setup with centre
frequency at UARFCN number 3013.

NOTE 2: The following BCCH ARFCN's specified for FDD Band III and IX
provide enough gap for a UMTS cell and its AWGN to be setup with centre
frequency at UARFCN number 1375 and 9312.

NOTE 3: The following BCCH ARFCN's specified for FDD Band II provide
enough gap for a UMTS cell and its AWGN to be setup with centre
frequency at UARFCN number 9800.

NOTE 4: The following BCCH ARFCN's specified for FDD Band V, VI and XIX
provide enough gap for a UMTS cell and its AWGN to be setup with centre
frequency at UARFCN number 4400.

##### 8.7.3A.4.2 Procedure

1\) A call is set up according to the test procedure specified in TS
34.108 \[3\] clause 7.3.2. The RF parameters for cell 1 are set up
according to table to table 8.7.3A.1 and 8.7.3A.2.

2\) The RF parameters for two GSM cells are set up according to the step
1 in table 8.7.3A.5. The fading profile for the BCCHs will be set to
static, see 51.010-1 \[25\]. The ARFCN numbers for GSM cells are set up
according to table 8.7.3.A.4.

3\) If compressed mode is required , SS shall transmit PHYSICAL CHANNEL
RECONFIGURATION message. Otherwise go to step 5.

4\) UE shall transmit PHYSICAL CHANNEL RECONFIGURATION COMPLETE message.

5\) SS shall transmit MEASUREMENT CONTROL message.

6\) UE shall transmit periodically MEASUREMENT REPORT messages.

7\) SS shall check GSM carrier RSSI value of the two GSM cells in
MEASUREMENT REPORT messages. The GSM CARRIER RSSI values reported in the
first measurement report are discarded. The SS records repeatedly GSM
CARRIER RSSI values reported for the two BCCHs in each step. One report
produces more than one mapped level or level difference. If the UE
reports a value compliant with the applicable Table 8.7.3A.6 or 8.7.3A.7
or 8.7.3A.8 or 8.7.3A.9 then a success is recorded. Otherwise a failure
is recorded. The successes and failures are assigned to the individual
mapped levels or level differences. Repeat steps 7 according to Annex
F.6.2 table 6.2.8. The repetition shall be continued, until the last
mapped level or level difference experiences an early decision according
to Annex F.6.2.

8\) The RF parameters for two GSM cells are set up according to the next
test step in table 8.7.3A.5.

9\) Repeat procedure steps 7 and 8 until MEASUREMENT REPORT messages
from the test step 12 of Table 8.7.3A.5 have been recorded.

##### Specific Message Contents {#specific-message-contents-8 .H6}

All messages indicated above shall use the same content as described in
the system information in clause 6.1.0b of 34.108 \[3\] and in default
message content in clause 9 of 34.108 \[3\], with the following
exceptions:

##### PHYSICAL CHANNEL RECONFIGURATION message for Inter-RAT measurement (step 3): {#physical-channel-reconfiguration-message-for-inter-rat-measurement-step-3 .H6}

For the UE finally to pass, all preliminary decisions must be decided
pass.

FFS: 3 test-environments \* 12 reporting periods \* 3 levels per report
= 108 individual pass fail decisions

An individual pass/fail decision has a wrong decision risk of 5%. All
individual decisions must pass, to pass the entire test. As a
consequence a UE with marginal performance for each individual level
will pass each individual test with a probability of 95%, but will fail
the entire test with high probability. It is for further study whether
to:

\- Accept this situation.

\- Decrease the wrong decision risk for each individual test at the
expense of additional test time, to increase the pass probability for
the entire test.

\- Introduce allowance to fail a limited number of individual tests.

  -------------------- ------------------------------------------ ------------------------

NOTE 1: Although test requirements are given for all UE reported values,
a good UE will likely report values between PUEMAX and PUEMAX - 10 dB.
However, even a good UE may report also wider range of values due to
errors in TPC command reception and allowed range specified for UE
transmit power setting accuracy when Maximum Allowed UL TX Power has
been signalled. On the other hand, a faulty UE may report any power
value but then it does not fulfil the Table 8.7.3C.5 requirements for
mean power or then it will not pass some other tests e.g. TC 5.2 of this
specification.

NOTE 2: If the above Test Requirement differs from the Minimum
Requirement then the Test Tolerance applied for this test is non-zero.
The Test Tolerance for this test is defined in clause F.2 and the
explanation of how the Minimum Requirement has been relaxed by the Test
Tolerance is given in clause F.4.

### 8.7.3D UE transmitted power (Rel-5 and later)

#### 8.7.3D.1 Definition and applicability

The UE transmitted power absolute accuracy is defined as difference
between the UE reported value and the UE transmitted power measured by
test system. The reference point for the UE transmitted power shall be
the antenna connector of the UE.

The requirements and this test apply to Release 5 and later releases for
the FDD UE.

#### 8.7.3D.2 Minimum requirements

This requirement is applicable in CELL\_DCH state. The measured quantity
is the transmitted power averaged over the longest period (excluding a
25 µs period either side of any expected composite power change) during
which the nominal composite symbol power reaches the maximum during 1
DPCH slot interval.

The normative reference for this requirement is TS 25.133 \[2\] clause
9.1.6.

#### 8.7.3D.3 Test purpose

The purpose of this test is to verify that for any reported value of UE
Transmitted Power in the range specified in table 8.7.3D.5 that the
actual UE mean power lies within the range specified in clause 8.7.3D.5.

#### 8.7.3D.4 Method of test

##### 8.7.3D.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: normal, TL/VL, TL/VH, TH/VL, TH/VH; see clauses G.2.1
and G.2.2.

Frequencies to be tested: mid range; see clause G.2.4.

1\) Connect SS to the UE antenna connector as shown in figure A.1.

The test parameters are given in Table 8.7.3D.4.1 and 8.7.3D.4.2 below.
In the measurement control information it shall be indicated to the UE
that periodic reporting of the UE transmitted power measurement shall be
used. The UE measured quantity absolute accuracy is defined in Table
8.7.3D.4.3.

##### 8.7.3D.4.2 Procedure

> 1\) A call is set up according to the test procedure specified in TS
> 34.108 \[3\] subclause 7.3.2. The RF parameters are set up according
> to table 8.7.3D.4.1 and 8.7.3D.4.2. Set the UE power and Maximum
> allowed UL TX power to the maximum power for the UE power class.
>
> 2\) SS shall send continuously during the entire test Up power control
> commands to the UE.

3\) SS shall transmit the MEASUREMENT CONTROL message as defined in the
specific message contents below.

> 4\) Decode the UE Transmitted power reported by the UE in the next
> available MEASUREMENT REPORT message.

5\) Measure the mean power of the UE over the longest period (excluding
a 25 µs period either side of any expected composite power change)
during which the nominal composite symbol power reaches the maximum
during one DPCH slot interval.

> 6\) Steps 4 and 5 shall be repeated until statistical significance
> according to Annex F.6.2.8 is achieved.

7\) Decrease the Maximum allowed UL TX power by 1 dB. The SS shall
transmit the PHYSICAL CHANNEL RECONFIGURATION message, as defined in the
specific message contents below.

> 8\) SS shall wait for the PHYSICAL CHANNEL RECONFIGURATION COMPLETE
> message from the UE.

9\) Repeat from step 4) until the Maximum allowed UL TX Power reaches
PUEMAX-10.

NOTE 1: If the above Test Requirement differs from the Minimum
Requirement then the Test Tolerance applied for this test is non-zero.
The Test Tolerance for this test is defined in clause F.2 and the
explanation of how the Minimum Requirement has been relaxed by the Test
Tolerance is given in clause F.4.

### 8.7.4 SFN-CFN observed time difference

#### 8.7.4.1 Intra frequency measurement requirement

##### 8.7.4.1.1 Definition and applicability

The intra frequency SFN-CFN observed time difference is defined as the
SFN-CFN observed time difference from the active cell to a neighbour
cell that is in the same frequency. This measurement is specified in
clause 5.1.8 of TS 25.215 \[22\].

The reference point for the SFN-CFN observed time difference shall be
the antenna connector of the UE.

The requirements and this test apply to all types of UTRA for the FDD
UE.

##### 8.7.4.1.2 Minimum requirements

The accuracy requirement in table 8.7.4.1.1 is valid under the following
conditions:

CPICH\_RSCP1,2\|~dBm~ according to Annex L.3.8 for a corresponding Band

$\left| \text{CPICH}_{\text{RSCP}}1|_{\text{in}\ \text{dBm}} - \text{CPICH}_{\text{RSCP}}2|_{\text{in}\ \text{dBm}} \right| \leq \text{20}\text{dB}$

$\frac{I_{o}}{\left( {\hat{I}}_{\text{or}} \right)}|_{\text{in}\ \text{dB}}\  - \ \left( \frac{\text{CPICH}_{}}{I_{\text{or}}} \right)|_{\text{in}\ \text{dB}} \leq \text{20}\text{dB}$

$\frac{I_{o}}{\left( {\hat{I}}_{\text{or}} \right)}|_{\text{in}\ \text{dB}}\  - \ \left( \frac{P - \text{CCPCH}_{}}{I_{\text{or}}} \right)|_{\text{in}\ \text{dB}}$
is low enough to ensure successful SFN decoding.

The normative reference for this requirement is TS 25.133 \[2\] clauses
9.1.7.1 and A.9.1.4.2.

##### 8.7.4.1.3 Test Purpose

The purpose of this test is to verify that the SFN-CFN observed time
difference measurement accuracy is within the specified limits in the
clause 8.7.4.1.2. This measurement is for handover timing purposes to
identify active cell and neighbour cell time difference.

##### 8.7.4.1.4 Method of test

##### 8.7.4.1.4.1 Initial conditions {#initial-conditions-8 .H6}

Test environment: normal, TL/VL, TL/VH, TH/VL, TH/VH; see clauses G.2.1
and G.2.2.

Frequencies to be tested: mid range; see clause G.2.4.

During the test the timing difference between Cell 1 and 2 can be set to
value from 0...9830399 chips.

In this case all cells are in the same frequency. Table 8.7.4.1.2
defines the limits of signal strengths and code powers, where the
requirements are applicable.

##### 8.7.4.1.4.2 Procedure {#procedure-8 .H6}

1\) A call is set up according to the test procedure specified in TS
34.108 \[3\] subclause 7.3.2. The RF parameters for Test 1 are set up
according to table 8.7.4.1.4.

2\) SS shall transmit MEASUREMENT CONTROL message.

3\) UE shall transmit periodically MEASUREMENT REPORT message.

4\) SS shall check \"OFF\" and \"Tm\" values in MEASUREMENT REPORT
message and calculate SFN-CFN observed time difference value according
to the definition in clause 5.1.8 of TS 25.215 \[22\]. This value shall
be compared to the actual SFN-CFN observed time difference value for
each MEASUREMENT REPORT message.

5\) SS shall check MEASUREMENT REPORT messages transmitted by UE until
statistical significance according to Annex F.6.2.8 is achieved

6\) The RF parameters are set up according to table 8.7.4.1.4 for Test
2. While RF parameters are being set up, MEASUREMENT REPORT messages
from UE are ignored. SS shall wait for additional 1s and ignore the
MEASUREMENT REPORT messages during this period. Then, step 4) and 5)
above are repeated.

7\) The RF parameters are set up according to table 8.7.4.1.4 for Test
3. While RF parameters are being set up, MEASUREMENT REPORT messages
from UE are ignored. SS shall wait for additional 1s and ignore the
MEASUREMENT REPORT messages during this period. Then, step 4) and 5)
above are repeated.

8\) The SS shall transmit RRC CONNECTION RELEASE message.

9\) UE shall transmit RRC CONNECTION RELEASE COMPLETE message.

##### Specific Message Contents {#specific-message-contents-11 .H6}

All messages indicated above shall use the same content as described in
the default message content in clause 9 of 34.108 \[3\], with the

#### 8.7.4.2 Inter frequency measurement requirement

##### 8.7.4.2.1 Definition and applicability

The inter frequency SFN-CFN observed time difference is defined as the
SFN-CFN time difference from the active cell to a neighbour cell that is
in a different frequency. This measurement is specified in clause 5.1.8
of TS 25.215 \[22\].

The reference point for the SFN-CFN observed time difference shall be
the antenna connector of the UE.

The requirements and this test apply to all types of UTRA for the FDD
UE.

The normative reference for this requirement is TS 25.133 \[2\] clauses
9.1.7.2 and A.9.1.4.2.

##### 8.7.4.2.3 Test purpose

The purpose of this test is to verify that the SFN-CFN observed time
difference measurement accuracy is within the specified limits in the
clause 8.7.4.2.2. This measurement is for handover timing purposes to
identify active cell and neighbour cell time difference.

##### 8.7.4.2.4 Method of test

##### 8.7.4.2.4.1 Initial conditions {#initial-conditions-9 .H6}

Test environment: normal, TL/VL, TL/VH, TH/VL, TH/VH; see clauses G.2.1
and G.2.2.

Frequencies to be tested: mid range; see clause G.2.4.

During the test the timing difference between Cell 1 and 2 can be set to
value from 0...9830399 chips.

In this test case both cells are on different frequencies.

For UEs that require compressed mode, compressed mode is applied. The
gap length is 7, detailed definition is in clause C.5, set 1 of table
C.5.2 except for TGRRC and TGCFN. TGPRC and TGCFN shall set to
\"Infinity\" and \"(Current CFN + (256 -- TTI/10msec))mod 256\". When
compressed mode is in use, the OFF parameter will always be set to 0 as
described in TS 25.215 clause 5.1.8

For UEs that do not require compressed mode, compressed mode is not
applied and therefore no Physical Channel Reconfiguration message will
be sent. In this case, the OFF parameter will be a measured value.

Table 8.7.4.2.2 defines the limits of signal strengths and code powers,
where the requirement is applicable.

##### 8.7.4.2.4.2 Procedure {#procedure-9 .H6}

1\) A call is set up according to the test procedure specified in TS
34.108 \[3\] subclause 7.3.2. The RF parameters for Test 1 are set up
according to table 8.7.4.2.4.

2\) If compressed mode is required, SS shall transmit PHYSICAL CHANNEL
RECONFIGURATION message. Otherwise go to step 4.

3\) UE shall transmit PHYSICAL CHANNEL RECONFIGURATION COMPLETE message.

4\) SS shall transmit MEASUREMENT CONTROL message.

5\) UE shall transmit periodically MEASUREMENT REPORT messages.

6\) SS shall check \"OFF\" and \"Tm\" values in MEASUREMENT REPORT
message and calculate SFN-CFN observed time difference value according
to the definition in clause 5.1.8 of TS 25.215 \[22\]. Note that
according to TS 25.215 \[22\] UE will always report the \"OFF\"
parameter as zero in the specific case where compressed mode is in use.
In other cases, the \"OFF\" parameter will be a measured value. This
should be taken into account when calculating the SFN-CFN observed time
difference value. This calculated value shall be compared to the actual
SFN-CFN observed time difference value for each MEASUREMENT REPORT
message.

7\) SS shall check MEASUREMENT REPORT messages transmitted by UE until
statistical significance according to Annex F.6.2.8 is achieved.

8\) The RF parameters are set up according to table 8.7.4.2.4 for Test
2. While RF parameters are being set up, MEASUREMENT REPORT messages
from UE are ignored. SS shall wait for additional 1s and ignore the
MEASUREMENT REPORT messages during this period. Then, steps 5), 6) and
7) above are repeated.

9\) The RF parameters are set up according to table 8.7.4.2.4 for Test
3. While RF parameters are being set up, MEASUREMENT REPORT messages
from UE are ignored. SS shall wait for additional 1s and ignore the
MEASUREMENT REPORT messages during this period. Then, steps 5), 6) and
7) above are repeated.

10\) The SS shall transmit RRC CONNECTION RELEASE message.

11\) UE shall transmit RRC CONNECTION RELEASE COMPLETE message.

##### Specific Message Contents {#specific-message-contents-12 .H6}

All messages indicated above shall use the same content as described in
the default message content in clause 9 of 34.108 \[3\], with the
following exceptions:

NOTE: If the above Test Requirement differs from the Minimum Requirement
then the Test Tolerance applied for this test is non-zero. The Test
Tolerance for this test is defined in clause F.2 and the explanation of
how the Minimum Requirement has been relaxed by the Test Tolerance is
given in clause F.4.

### 8.7.5 SFN-SFN observed time difference

#### 8.7.5.1 SFN-SFN observed time difference type 1

##### 8.7.5.1.1 Definition and applicability

This measurement is specified in clause 5.1.9 of TS 25.215 \[22\]. The
reference point for the SFN-SFN observed time difference type 1 shall be
the antenna connector of the UE.

The requirements and this test apply to all types of UTRA for the FDD
UE.

##### 8.7.5.1.2 Minimum requirements

The accuracy requirement in table 8.7.5.1.1 is valid under the following
conditions:

CPICH\_RSCP1\|~dBm~ according to Annex L.3.10 for a corresponding Band

$\left| \text{CPICH}_{\text{RSCP}}1|_{\text{in}\ \text{dBm}} - \text{CPICH}_{\text{RSCP}}2|_{\text{in}\ \text{dBm}} \right| \leq \text{20}\text{dB}$

$\frac{I_{o}}{\left( {\hat{I}}_{\text{or}} \right)}|_{\text{in}\ \text{dB}}\  - \ \left( \frac{\text{CPICH}_{}}{I_{\text{or}}} \right)|_{\text{in}\ \text{dB}} \leq \text{20}\text{dB}$

$\frac{I_{o}}{\left( {\hat{I}}_{\text{or}} \right)}|_{\text{in}\ \text{dB}}\  - \ \left( \frac{P - \text{CCPCH}_{}}{I_{\text{or}}} \right)|_{\text{in}\ \text{dB}}$
is low enough to ensure successful SFN decoding.

9.1.8.1.1 and A.9.1.5.1.2.

##### 8.7.5.1.3 Test purpose

The purpose of this test is to verify that the measurement accuracy of
SFN-SFN observed time difference type 1 is within the limit specified in
clause 8.7.5.1.2. This measurement is for identifying time difference
between two cells.

##### 8.7.5.1.4 Method of test

##### 8.7.5.1.4.1 Initial conditions {#initial-conditions-10 .H6}

Test environment: normal; see clauses G.2.1 and G.2.2.

Frequencies to be tested: mid range; see clause G.2.4.

During the test the timing difference between Cell 1 and 2 can be set to
value from 0...9830399 chips.

1\) Connect SS to the UE antenna connector as shown in figure A.14.

In this case all cells are in the same frequency. Table 8.7.5.1.2
defines the limits of signal strengths and code powers, where the
requirements are applicable.

##### 8.7.5.1.4.2 Procedure {#procedure-10 .H6}

1\) A call is set up according to the test procedure specified in TS
34.108 \[3\] subclause 7.3.5. The RF parameters for Test 1 are set up
according to table 8.7.5.1.4.

2\) SS shall transmit MEASUREMENT CONTROL message.

3\) UE shall transmit periodically MEASUREMENT REPORT messages.

4\) SS shall check \"SFN-SFN observed time difference type 1\" value in
MEASUREMENT REPORT message. The reported value shall be compared to
actual SFN-SFN observed time difference type 1 value for each
MEASUREMENT REPORT message.

5\) SS shall check MEASUREMENT REPORT messages transmitted by UE until
statistical significance according to Annex F.6.2.8 is achieved.

6\) The RF parameters are set up according to table 8.7.5.1.4 for Test
2. While RF parameters are being set up, MEASUREMENT REPORT messages
from UE are ignored. SS shall wait for additional 1s and ignore the
MEASUREMENT REPORT messages during this period. Then, step 4) and 5)
above are repeated

7\) The RF parameters are set up according to table 8.7.5.1.4 for Test
3. While RF parameters are being set up, MEASUREMENT REPORT messages
from UE are ignored. SS shall wait for additional 1s and ignore the
MEASUREMENT REPORT messages during this period. Then, step 4) and 5)
above are repeated.

8\) The SS shall transmit RRC CONNECTION RELEASE message.

9\) UE shall transmit RRC CONNECTION RELEASE COMPLETE message.

The accuracy requirement in table 8.7.5.3.1 is valid under the following
conditions:

CPICH\_RSCP1,2\|~dBm~ according to Annex B.3.11 for a corresponding Band

$\frac{I_{o}}{\left( {\hat{I}}_{\text{or}} \right)}|_{\text{in}\ \text{dB}}\  - \ \left( \frac{\text{CPICH}_{}}{I_{\text{or}}} \right)|_{\text{in}\ \text{dB}} \leq \text{20}\text{dB}$

Additionally the accuracy requirement in table 8.7.5.3.1 is also valid
for neighbour cells for which the following conditions apply to during
idle periods provided idle periods have a length of 1 slot:

CPICH\_RSCPx,y\|~dBm~ ≥ -114 dBm.

$\frac{I_{o_{\text{idle}_{\text{period}}}}}{\left( {\hat{I}}_{\text{or}} \right)}|_{\text{in}\ \text{dB}}\  - \ \left( \frac{\text{CPICH}_{}}{I_{\text{or}}} \right)|_{\text{in}\ \text{dB}} \leq \text{20}\text{dB}$,

where *x* and *y* represent cells measured using idle periods and
I~o\_idle-period~ is the total received power during the idle period.

NOTE: Additional general conditions are needed for the requirements in
table 8.7.5.3.1 to be valid.

NOTE: If the above Test Requirement differs from the Minimum Requirement
then the Test Tolerance applied for this test is non-zero. The Test
Tolerance for this test is defined in clause F.2 and the explanation of
how the Minimum Requirement has been relaxed by the Test Tolerance is
given in clause F.4.

#### 8.7.6.1A UE Rx-Tx time difference type 1 (Release 6 and later)

##### 8.7.6.1A.1 Definition and applicability

The UE Rx-Tx time difference is defined as the time difference between
the UE uplink DPCCH/DPDCH frame transmission and the first detected path
(in time) of the downlink DPCH frame from the measured radio link. The
reference point of the UE Rx-Tx time difference shall be the antenna
connector of the UE. This measurement is specified in clause 5.1.10 of
TS 25.215.

The connection is started using Cell 1, and then Cell 2 is added to the
active set so that Cell 1 is the timing reference. During the test the
downlink DPCH time difference between Cell 1 and Cell 2 can be set to
any value from ‑148 to +148 chips.

The requirements and this test apply to all types of UTRA for the FDD UE
for Release 6 and later releases.

##### 8.7.6.1A.4.2 Procedure {#a.4.2-procedure-1 .H6}

1\) A call is set up according to the test procedure specified in TS
34.108 \[3\] subclause 7.3.2. The RF parameters are set up according to
table 8.7.6.1A.4 for Test 1.

2\) SS shall send an ACTIVE SET UPDATE message with activation time
\"now \", adding cell 2 to the active set.

3\) SS shall transmit MEASUREMENT CONTROL message.

4\) UE shall transmit periodically MEASUREMENT REPORT message.

5\) SS shall check \"UE Rx-Tx time difference type 1\" value in
MEASUREMENT REPORT message. The reported value shall be compared to
actual UE Rx-Tx time difference value for each MEASUREMENT REPORT
message. The \"UE Rx-Tx time difference type 1\" measurement is measured
for Cell 2. The comparison should be repeated until statistical
significance according to Annex F.6.2.8 is achieved.

6\) The RF parameters are set up according table 8.7.6.1A.4 for Test 2.
While RF parameters are being set up, MEASUREMENT REPORT messages from
UE are ignored. SS shall wait for additional 1s and ignore the
MEASUREMENT REPORT messages during this period.

7\) SS shall check \"UE Rx-Tx time difference type 1\" value in
MEASUREMENT REPORT message. The reported value shall be compared to
actual UE Rx-Tx time difference value for each MEASUREMENT REPORT
message. The \"UE Rx-Tx time difference type 1\" measurement is measured
for Cell 2. The comparison should be repeated until statistical
significance according to Annex F.6.2.8 is achieved.

8\) The RF parameters are set up according table 8.7.6.1A.4 for Test 3.
While RF parameters are being set up, MEASUREMENT REPORT messages from
UE are ignored. SS shall wait for additional 1s and ignore the
MEASUREMENT REPORT messages during this period.

9\) SS shall check \"UE Rx-Tx time difference type 1\" value in
MEASUREMENT REPORT message. The reported value shall be compared to
actual UE Rx-Tx time difference value for each MEASUREMENT REPORT
message. The \"UE Rx-Tx time difference type 1\" measurement is measured
for Cell 2. The comparison should be repeated until statistical
significance according to Annex F.6.2.8 is achieved .

10\) SS shall transmit RRC CONNECTION RELEASE message.

11\) UE shall transmit RRC CONNECTION RELEASE COMPLETE message.

NOTE 1: Only one value from -148 to +148 chips need to be set during the
test for the downlink DPCH time difference between Cell 1 and Cell 2.

#### 8.7.6.2 UE Rx-Tx time difference type 2

NOTE: This test case is not complete and there are currently no plans to
complete it.

##### 8.7.6.2.1 Definition and applicability

The UE Rx-Tx time difference is defined as the time difference between
the UE uplink DPCCH/DPDCH frame transmission and the first detected path
(in time) of the downlink DPCH frame from the measured radio link. The
reference point of the UE Rx-Tx time difference shall be the antenna
connector of the UE. This measurement is specified in clause 5.1.10 of
TS 25.215.

The requirements and this test apply to all types of UTRA for the FDD UE
supporting this measurement.

The normative reference for this requirement is TS 25.133 \[2\] clause
9.1.9.2.1.

##### 8.7.6.2.3 Test purpose

The purpose of this test is to verify that the measurement accuracy of
Rx-Tx time difference type 2 is within the limit specified in clause
8.7.6.2.2.

The connection is started using cell 1, then cell 2 is added to the
active set so that cell 1 is the timing reference. *During the test the
downlink DPCH time difference between Cell 1 and 2 can be set to any
value from ‑148 to 148 chips.*

Table 8.7.6.2.2 defines the limits of signal strengths and code powers,
where the requirements are applicable.

The normative reference for this requirement is TS 25.133 \[2\] clauses
9.1.11.1 and A.9.1.8.

##### 8.7.8.1.3 Test purpose

The purpose of this test is to verify that the P-CCPCH RSCP absolute
measurement accuracy is within the specified limits.

##### 8.7.8.1.4 Method of test

##### 8.7.8.1.4.1 Initial conditions {#initial-conditions-12 .H6}

##### 8.7.8.1.4.1.1 3.84Mcps TDD option {#mcps-tdd-option-2 .H6}

Test environment: normal, TL/VL, TL/VH, TH/VL, TH/VH; see clauses G.2.1
and G.2.2.

Frequencies to be tested: mid range; see clause G.2.4.

In this case both cells are on different frequencies. Cell 1 is a UTRA
FDD cell and cell 2 is a 3.84Mcps TDD cell. The second Beacon timeslot
shall be provided for cell 2 in timeslot 8. Compressed mode as specified
in TS 25.101 \[1\] section A.5, set 3 of table A.22, is applied. *TGPRC
and TGCFN shall be set to \"Infinity\" and \"(Current CFN + (256 --
TTI/10msec)) mod 256\".* P-CCPCH RSCP inter frequency absolute accuracy
requirements are tested by using test parameters in Table 8.7.8.1.2.

##### 8.7.8.1.5 Test requirements

The PCCPCH RSCP measurement accuracy shall meet the requirements in
clause 8.7.8.1.2.

NOTE: If the above Test Requirement differs from the Minimum Requirement
then the Test Tolerance applied for this test is non-zero. The Test
Tolerance for this test is defined in clause F.2 and the explanation of
how the Minimum Requirement has been relaxed by the Test Tolerance is
given in clause F.4.

### 8.7.9 UE Transmission Power Headroom

#### 8.7.9.1 Definition and applicability

The accuracy requirements for the UE transmission power headroom depends
on the total power transmitted by the UE as defined in the functionality
in section 9.2.5.3.2 of TS 25.321 \[13\], section 9.1.13.4 of TS 25.133
\[2\] and section 5.1.14 of TS 25.215 \[22\]. The requirements and this
test apply to Release 6 and later releases for all types of UTRA for the
FDD UE that support E-DCH and HSDPA.

#### 8.7.9.2 Minimum Requirements

The UE transmission power headroom (UPH) is defined in section 5.1.14 of
TS 25.215 \[22\] as the ratio of the maximum UE transmission power and
the corresponding DPCCH code power, and shall be calculated as
following:

where:

Pmax,tx = min {Maximum allowed UL TX Power, Pmax} is the UE maximum
transmission power;

Maximum allowed UL TX Power is set by UTRAN and defined in \[8\];

Pmax is the UE nominal maximum output power according to the UE power
class and specified in \[1\] table 6.1;

PDPCCH is the transmitted code power on DPCCH.

The accuracy requirements for UE transmission power headroom depends on
the total power transmitted by the UE. Table 8.7.9.1 defines the
accuracy of the measured quantity as defined in section 9.1.13.4 of TS
25.133 \[2\].

##### 8.7.9.4.2 Test procedure

1\) The Scheduling Information configuration for the E-DCH indicates to
the UE that it shall periodically report Scheduling Information, which
contains UPH measurement every E-DCH TTI. During the test the system
simulator shall not send any scheduling grant to the UE, and therefore
the UE will not send any payload data on the E-DCH.

2\) The SS shall set the UE DPCCH power to be between -11.1 dBm and -8
dBm for a power class 3 UE, or between -14.1 dBm and -11dBm for a power
class 4 UE by using uplink power control.

3\) The SS measures both the power transmitted by the UE on DPCCH and
the total output power of the UE every time slot. The SS averages both
the DPCCH output power and total output power of the UE over 100 ms.

4\) The SS estimates the UE transmission power headroom as the
difference between the maximum allowed uplink transmit power (*P*~max~)
and the average DPCCH power measured in step 3.

5\) The SS notes the UE transmission power headroom value reported in
the Scheduling Information.

6\) The SS calculates the difference between the UE transmission power
headroom value estimated in step 4 and the reported UE transmission
power headroom noted in step 5. The SS notes this as the UE transmission
power headroom accuracy, and compares it to the applicable limit
according to the total output power measured in step 3.

7\) If the UE transmission power headroom accuracy exceeds the value in
Table 8.7.9.5 count a bad result, otherwise a good result with respect
to the actually set TX power (DTX on E-DPDCH is not considered a bad
result).

8\) Repeat steps 3 to 7 in order to collect more good or bad results for
the currently set power level. Continue the repetition, until
statistical significance according to Annex F.6.2.8 is achieved.

9\) The SS sends 5 up TPC commands at the frame boundary to bring the Tx
power of the UE up by a nominal 1 dB step, then alternate UP/DOWN to
maintain constant Tx power.

10\) Repeat steps 3 through 9 and note the UE transmission power
headroom accuracy for each UE total power value until the UE stops
reporting UPH or does not give lower UPH values for 8 consecutive
repetitions of steps 3 through 9. If the lowest reported UPH is
UE\_POWER\_HEADROOM\_13 or higher for a power class 3 UE, or
UE\_POWER\_HEADROOM\_14 or higher for a power class 4 UE, then count a
bad result (DTX on E-DPDCH is not considered a bad result).

#### 8.7.9.5 Test requirements

The UE transmission power headroom measurement report accuracy recorded
in steps 6, 9 and 10 above shall meet the requirements in table 8.7.9.5.
The rate of correct measurements observed during repeated tests shall be
at least 90%. To pass the test, the UE transmission power headroom
accuracy for each power level in the reporting range must pass. Once a
power level is passed, no more results need be collected on this power
level.

### 8.7.10 E-UTRAN FDD RSRP absolute accuracy (CELL\_DCH)

##### 8.7.10.1 Definition and applicability

The absolute accuracy of RSRP is defined as the RSRP measured from a
cell that has different carrier frequency from the serving cell.

The E-UTRAN FDD RSRP absolute accuracy measurement is used for handover
between UTRAN FDD and E-UTRAN FDD.

The requirements and this test apply to the combined UTRAN FDD and
E-UTRAN FDD UE for Rel.9 and later.

##### 8.7.10.2 Minimum Requirements

The accuracy requirements for E-UTRA RSRP measurements in CELL\_DCH
state shall be the same as the inter-frequency RSRP accuracy
requirements in3GPP TS36.133\[34\], as follows:

Cell specific reference signals are transmitted either from one, two or
four antenna ports.

Conditions defined in TS 36.101 \[37\] clause 7.3 for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled.

RSRP\|dBm according to TS 36.133 \[34\] Annex B.3.3 for a corresponding
Band

##### 8.7.10.3 Test purpose

*The purpose of this test is to verify that the* E-UTRAN FDD RSRP
*measurement accuracy in CELL\_DCH state, for UE that* needs compressed
mode to perform E-UTRAN FDD measurements, *is within the specified
limits.* This measurement is for UTRAN FDD to E-UTRAN FDD handover
evaluation.

##### 8.7.10.4 Method of test

##### 8.7.10.4.1 Initial conditions {#initial-conditions-14 .H6}

Test environment: normal, TL/VL, TL/VH, TH/VL, TH/VH; see clauses G.2.1
and G.2.2.

Frequencies to be tested: see table K.2 in Annex K.

In the test in Cell\_DCH state compressed mode with purpose \"E-UTRAN
FDD RSRP Measurement\" is applied to measure on E-UTRAN FDD. The
compressed mode pattern repeats every 80 ms and uses a gap length of 10
slots. Further details are found in TS 25.101 annex A.5.

Tables 8.7.10.4.1.1 and 8.7.10.4.1.2 define the limits of signal
strengths and code powers on the UTRA FDD cell where requirements are
applicable. In the measurement control information periodic reporting of
E-UTRAN FDD RSRP is indicated to the UE. The E-UTRAN FDD test parameters
are given in Table 8.7.10.4.1.3.

##### 8.7.10.4.2 Test Procedure {#test-procedure-1 .H6}

1\) A call is set up according to the test procedure specified in TS
34.108 \[3\] subclause 7.3.2. The RF parameters for Test 1 are set up
according to table 8.7.10.5.2 and table 8.7.10.5.3.

2\) If compressed mode is required,SS shall transmit PHYSICAL CHANNEL
RECONFIGURATION message (compressed gaps). Otherwise, Go to Step4.

3\) UE shall transmit PHYSICAL CHANNEL RECONFIGURATION COMPLETE message
(compressed gaps).

4\) SS shall transmit MEASUREMENT CONTROL message for inter RAT
measurement. In the measurment control information periodic reporting of
the E-UTRAN FDD RSRP is requested to the UE.

5\) After sending the measurement control message, wait for 10s, UE
shall transmit periodically MEASUREMENT REPORT messages.

6\) After 10s wait in step 5, SS shall check E-UTRAN FDD RSRP value of
Cell 2 in periodical MEASUREMENT REPORT messages. E-UTRAN FDD RSRP power
of Cell 2 reported by UE is compared to actual E-UTRAN FDD RSRP value of
Cell 2 for each MEASUREMENT REPORT message. If the UE fails to report
the measurement values including neighbor cell RSRP, the number of
failure tests is increased by one.

7\) SS shall check MEASUREMENT REPORT messages transmitted by UE until
statistical significance according to Tables G.2.3-1 in TS36.521-3
\[38\] is achieved.

8\) The RF parameters are set up according to table 8.7.10.5.3 for Test
2. While RF parameters are being set up, MEASUREMENT REPORT messages
from UE are ignored. SS shall wait for additional 3s and ignore the
MEASUREMENT REPORT messages during this period. Then, steps 5) to 7)
above are repeated.

9\) The SS shall transmit RRC CONNECTION RELEASE message.

10\) UE shall transmit RRC CONNECTION RELEASE COMPLETE message.

##### Specific Message Contents {#specific-message-contents-17 .H6}

### 8.7.11 E-UTRAN TDD RSRP absolute accuracy (CELL\_DCH)

##### 8.7.11.1 Definition and applicability

The absolute accuracy of RSRP is defined as the RSRP measured from a
cell that has different carrier frequency from the serving cell.

The E-UTRAN TDD RSRP absolute accuracy measurement is used for handover
between UTRAN FDD and E-UTRAN TDD.

The requirements and this test apply to the combined UTRAN FDD and
E-UTRAN TDD UE Release 9 and later.

##### 8.7.11.3 Test purpose

*The purpose of this test is to verify that the* E-UTRAN TDD RSRP
*measurement accuracy in CELL\_DCH state, for UE that* needs compressed
mode to perform E-UTRAN TDD measurements, *is within the specified
limits.* This measurement is for UTRAN FDD to E-UTRAN TDD handover
evaluation.

##### 8.7.11.4 Method of test

##### 8.7.11.4.1 Initial conditions {#initial-conditions-15 .H6}

Test environment: normal, TL/VL, TL/VH, TH/VL, TH/VH; see clauses G.2.1
and G.2.2.

Frequencies to be tested: see table K.2 in Annex K.

In the test in Cell\_DCH state compressed mode with purpose \"E-UTRAN
TDD RSRP Measurement\" is applied to measure on E-UTRAN TDD. The
compressed mode pattern repeats every 80 ms and uses a gap length of 10
slots. Further details are found in table A.22 in annex A.5 of 3GPP TS
25.101.

Tables 8.7.11.4.1.1 and 8.7.11.4.1.2 define the limits of signal
strengths and code powers on the UTRA FDD cell where requirements are
applicable. In the measurement control information periodic reporting of
E-UTRAN TDD RSRP is indicated to the UE. The E-UTRAN TDD test parameters
are given in Table 8.7.11.4.1.3.

##### 8.7.11.4.2 Procedure {#procedure-13 .H6}

1\) A call is set up according to the test procedure specified in TS
34.108 \[3\] subclause 7.3.2. The RF parameters for Test 1 are set up
according to table 8.7.11.5.2 and table 8.7.11. 5.3.

2\) If compressed mode is required, SS shall transmit PHYSICAL CHANNEL
RECONFIGURATION message (compressed gaps). Otherwise, Go to Step4.

3\) UE shall transmit PHYSICAL CHANNEL RECONFIGURATION COMPLETE message.

4\) SS shall transmit MEASUREMENT CONTROL message for inter RAT
measurement. In the measurment control information periodic reporting of
the E-UTRAN TDD RSRP is requested to the UE.

5\) After sending the measurement control message, wait for 10s, UE
shall transmit periodically MEASUREMENT REPORT messages.

6\) After 10s wait in step 5, SS shall check E-UTRAN TDD RSRP value of
Cell 2 in periodical MEASUREMENT REPORT messages. E-UTRAN TDD RSRP power
of Cell 2 reported by UE is compared to actual E-UTRAN TDD RSRP value of
Cell 2 for each MEASUREMENT REPORT message. If the UE fails to report
the measurement values including neighbor cell RSRP, the number of
failure tests is increased by one.

7\) SS shall check MEASUREMENT REPORT messages transmitted by UE until

### 8.7.12 E-UTRAN FDD RSRQ absolute accuracy (CELL\_DCH)

##### 8.7.12.1 Definition and applicability

The absolute accuracy of RSRQ is defined as the RSRQ measured from a
cell that has different carrier frequency from the serving cell.

The E-UTRAN FDD RSRQ absolute accuracy measurement is used for handover
between UTRAN FDD and E-UTRAN FDD.

The requirements and this test apply to the combined UTRAN FDD and
E-UTRAN FDD UE for Rel.9 and later.

##### 8.7.12.2 Minimum Requirements

The accuracy requirements for E-UTRA RSRQ measurements in CELL\_DCH
state shall be the same as the inter-frequency RSRQ accuracy
requirements in3GPP TS36.133\[34\], as follows:

\- Cell specific reference signals are transmitted either from one, two
or four antenna ports.

\- Conditions defined in TS 36.101 \[37\] clause 7.3 for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled.

\- RSRP\|dBm according to TS 36.133 Annex B.3.3 \[34\] for a
corresponding Band.

##### 8.7.12.3 Test purpose

*The purpose of this test is to verify that the* E-UTRAN FDD RSRQ
*measurement accuracy in CELL\_DCH state, for UE that* needs compressed
mode to perform E-UTRAN FDD measurements, *is within the specified
limits.* This measurement is for UTRAN FDD to E-UTRAN FDD handover
evaluation.

##### 8.7.12.4 Method of test

##### 8.7.12.4.1 Initial conditions {#initial-conditions-16 .H6}

Test environment: normal, TL/VL, TL/VH, TH/VL, TH/VH; see clauses G.2.1
and G.2.2.

Frequencies to be tested: see table K.2 in Annex K

In the test in Cell\_DCH state compressed mode with purpose \"E-UTRAN
FDD RSRQ Measurement\" is applied to measure on E-UTRAN FDD. The
compressed mode pattern repeats every 80 ms and uses a gap length of 10
slots. Further details are found in TS 25.101 annex A.5.

Tables 8.7.12.4.1.1 and 8.7.12.4.1.2 define the limits of signal
strengths and code powers on the UTRA FDD cell where the UTRA Carrier
RSSI absolute accuracy requirements are applicable. In the measurement
control information periodic reporting of E-UTRAN FDD RSRQ is indicated
to the UE. The E-UTRAN FDD test parameters are given in Table
8.7.12.4.1.3.

##### 8.7.12.4.2 Test Procedure {#test-procedure-2 .H6}

1\) A call is set up according to the test procedure specified in TS
34.108 \[3\] subclause 7.3.2. The RF parameters for Test 1 are set up
according to tables 8.7.12.5.2 and 8.7.12. 5.3.

2\) If compressed mode is required, SS shall transmit PHYSICAL CHANNEL
RECONFIGURATION message (compressed gaps). Otherwise, Go to Step4.

3\) UE shall transmit PHYSICAL CHANNEL RECONFIGURATION COMPLETE message
(compressed gaps).

4\) SS shall transmit MEASUREMENT CONTROL message for inter RAT
measurement. In the measurment control information periodic reporting of
the E-UTRAN FDD RSRQ is requested to the UE.

5\) After sending the measurement control message, wait for 10s, UE
shall transmit periodically MEASUREMENT REPORT messages.

6\) After 10s wait in step 5, SS shall check E-UTRAN FDD RSRQ value of
Cell 2 in periodical MEASUREMENT REPORT messages. The E-UTRAN FDD RSRQ
value of Cell 2 reported by UE is compared to actual E-UTRAN FDD RSRQ
value of Cell 2 for each MEASUREMENT REPORT message. If the UE fails to
report the measurement values including neighbor cell RSRQ, the number
of failure tests is increased by one.

7\) SS shall check MEASUREMENT REPORT messages transmitted by UE until
statistical significance according to Tables G.2.3-1 in TS36.521-3
\[38\] is achieved.

8\) The RF parameters are set up according to table 8.7.12. 5.3 for Test
2. While RF parameters are being set up, MEASUREMENT REPORT messages
from UE are ignored. SS shall wait for additional 3s and ignore the
MEASUREMENT REPORT messages during this period. Then, steps 5) to 7)
above are repeated.

9\) The RF parameters are set up according to table 8.7.12. 5.3 for Test
3. While RF parameters are being set up, MEASUREMENT REPORT messages
from UE are ignored. SS shall wait for additional 3s and ignore the
MEASUREMENT REPORT messages during this period. Then, steps 5) to 7)
above are repeated.

10\) The SS shall transmit RRC CONNECTION RELEASE message.

11\) UE shall transmit RRC CONNECTION RELEASE COMPLETE message.

### 8.7.13 E-UTRAN TDD RSRQ absolute accuracy (CELL\_DCH)

##### 8.7.13.1 Definition and applicability

The absolute accuracy of RSRQ is defined as the RSRQ measured from a
cell that has different carrier frequency from the serving cell.

The E-UTRAN TDD RSRQ absolute accuracy measurement is used for handover
between UTRAN FDD and E-UTRAN TDD.

The requirements and this test apply to the combined UTRAN FDD and
E-UTRAN TDD UE for Rel.9 and later.

##### 8.7.13.2 Minimum Requirements

The accuracy requirements for E-UTRA RSRQ measurements in CELL\_DCH
state shall be the same as the inter-frequency RSRQ accuracy
requirements in3GPP TS36.133\[34\], as follows:

\- Cell specific reference signals are transmitted either from one, two
or four antenna ports.

\- Conditions defined in TS 36.101 \[2\] clause 7.3 for reference
sensitivity are fulfilled.

\- RSRP\|dBm according to 36.133 Annex B.3.3 for a corresponding Band.

*The purpose of this test is to verify that the* E-UTRAN TDD RSRQ
*measurement accuracy in CELL\_DCH state, for UE that* needs compressed
mode to perform E-UTRAN TDD measurements, *is within the specified
limits.* This measurement is for UTRAN FDD to E-UTRAN TDD handover
evaluation.

##### 8.7.13.4 Method of test

##### 8.7.13.4.1 Initial conditions {#initial-conditions-17 .H6}

Test environment: normal, TL/VL, TL/VH, TH/VL, TH/VH; see clauses G.2.1
and G.2.2.

Frequencies to be tested: see table K.2 in Annex K.

In the test in Cell\_DCH state compressed mode with purpose \"E-UTRAN
TDD RSRQ Measurement\" is applied to measure on E-UTRAN TDD. The
compressed mode pattern repeats every 80 ms and uses a gap length of 10
slots. Further details are found in table A.22 in annex A.5 of 3GPP TS
25.101.

Tables 8.7.13.4.1.1 and 8.7.13.4.1.2 define the limits of signal
strengths and code powers on the UTRA FDD cell where the UTRA Carrier
RSSI absolute accuracy requirements are applicable. In the measurement
control information periodic reporting of E-UTRAN TDD RSRQ is indicated
to the UE. The E-UTRAN TDD test parameters are given in Table
8.7.13.4.1.3.

##### 8.7.13.4.2 Test Procedure {#test-procedure-3 .H6}

1\) A call is set up according to the test procedure specified in TS
34.108 \[3\] subclause 7.3.2. The RF parameters for Test 1 are set up
according to tables 8.7.13.5.2 and 8.7.13.5.3.

2\) If compressed mode is required, SS shall transmit PHYSICAL CHANNEL
RECONFIGURATION message(compressed gaps). Otherwise, Go to Step4.

3\) UE shall transmit PHYSICAL CHANNEL RECONFIGURATION COMPLETE message.

4\) SS shall transmit MEASUREMENT CONTROL message for inter RAT
measurement. In the measurment control information periodic reporting of
the E-UTRAN TDD RSRQ is requested to the UE.

5\) After sending the measurement control message, wait for 10s, UE
shall transmit periodically MEASUREMENT REPORT messages.

6\) After 10s wait in step 5, SS shall check E-UTRAN TDD RSRQ value of
Cell 2 in MEASUREMENT REPORT messages. The E-UTRAN TDD RSRQ value of
Cell 2 reported by UE is compared to actual E-UTRAN TDD RSRQ value of
Cell 2 for each MEASUREMENT REPORT message. If the UE fails to report
the measurement values including neighbor cell RSRQ, the number of
failure tests is increased by one.

7\) SS shall check MEASUREMENT REPORT messages transmitted by UE until
statistical significance according to Tables G.2.3-1 in TS36.521-3
\[38\] is achieved.

8\) The RF parameters are set up according to table 8.7.13.5.3 for Test
2. While RF parameters are being set up, MEASUREMENT REPORT messages
from UE are ignored. SS shall wait for additional 3s and ignore the
MEASUREMENT REPORT messages during this period. Then, step 5) to 7)
above are repeated.

9\) The RF parameters are set up according to table 8.7.13.5.3 for Test
3. While RF parameters are being set up, MEASUREMENT REPORT messages
from UE are ignored. SS shall wait for additional 3s and ignore the
MEASUREMENT REPORT messages during this period. Then, step 5) to 7)
above are repeated.

10\) The SS shall transmit RRC CONNECTION RELEASE message.

11\) UE shall transmit RRC CONNECTION RELEASE COMPLETE message.

All messages indicated above shall use the same content as described in
default message content in clause 9 of TS 34.108 \[3\] and clause 4.4
