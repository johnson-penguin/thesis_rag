9 Performance requirements for HSDPA
====================================

9.1 General
-----------

The performance requirements for the UE in this clause are specified for
the measurement channels specified in Annex C, the propagation
conditions specified in Annex D and the Down link Physical channels
specified in Annex E. Unless stated otherwise, DL power control is OFF.

Unless otherwise stated the performance requirements are specified at
the antenna connector of the UE. For UE(s) with more than one receive
antenna connector the fading of the signals and the AWGN signals applied
to each receiver antenna connector shall be uncorrelated. The levels of
the test signal applied to each of the antenna connectors shall be as
defined in the respective sections below.

A UE with one antenna connector may also fulfil the enhanced performance
requirements Type 1 and Type 3. The levels of the test signal are
applied to the single antenna connector as defined in the respective
sections below.

When DCCH has been configured on downlink DCH then DCCH Data shall be
continuously transmitted on downlink DCH during the measurement period.
When there is no signalling to transmit on downlink DCCH then dummy DCCH
transmission as described in Annex C.9 shall be used.

When DTCH has been configured on downlink DCH then DTCH Data shall be
continuously transmitted on downlink DCH during the measurement period.

The MAC headers on HS-DSCH shall be according to Annex C.9A.

The common RF test conditions of Performance requirements are defined in
clause E.5, and each test conditions in clause 9 should refer to clause
E.5. Individual test conditions are defined in the paragraph of each
test.

All throughput measurements in clause 9 shall be performed according to
the general rules for statistical testing in Annex F.6.3.

Unless otherwise stated, the UE output power for the tests shall be
greater than -10 dBm.

The requirement for a FDD UE that support HSDPA shall be tested
according to the declared UE HS-DSCH category. For Release 6 and later
UEs that support either the optional Type 1 or the Type 2 enhanced
performance requirement, the UE shall be tested according to this
enhanced performance requirement as well. For Release 7 and later UEs
that support optional Type 3 enhanced performance requirement, the UE
shall be tested according to this enhanced performance requirement as
well. For Release 8 and later UEs that support optional Type 3i enhanced
performance requirement, the UE shall be tested according to both type3
and type 3i enhanced performance requirement as well.

For the requirements for UEs supporting HS-DSCH categories 21, 22, 23,
24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 19, 30, 31 or 32, when the carriers are located in
the same frequency band, the spacing of the carrier frequencies of the
two cells shall be 5 MHz.9.1.1 Definition of Additive White Gaussian

During the Fixed Reference Channel tests the behaviour of the Node-B
emulator in response to the ACK/NACK signalling field of the HS-DPCCH is
specified in Table 9.2.4:

Table 9.2.4: Node-B Emulator Behaviour in response to ACK/NACK/DTX

  ------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  HS-DPCCH ACK/NACK Field State   Node-B Emulator Behaviour
  ACK                             ACK: new transmission using 1^st^ redundancy and constellation version (RV)
  NACK                            NACK: retransmission using the next RV (up to the maximum permitted number or RV's)
  DTX                             DTX: retransmission using the RV previously transmitted to the same H-ARQ process
  ------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE: Performance requirements in this section assume a sufficient power
allocation to HS-SCCH\_1 so that probability of reporting DTX is very
low.

The reference for this requirement is TS 25.101 \[1\] clauses 9.2.

### 9.2.1 Single Link Performance

The test cases in the following sections 9.2.1A to 9.2.1I define the
Single Link Performance tests for the different H-Sets for the different
HS-DSCH Categories as defined in tables 9.2.1, 9.2.2, 9.2.3 and 9.2.3A.

### 9.2.1A Single Link Performance - QPSK/16QAM, Fixed Reference Channel (FRC) H-Set 1/2/3

#### 9.2.1A.1 Definition and applicability

The receiver single link performance of the High Speed Physical Downlink
Shared Channel (HS-DSCH) in different multi-path fading environments are
determined by the information bit throughput R.

The requirements and this test apply to Release 5 and later releases for
all types of UTRA for the FDD UE that support HSDPA UE capability
categories 1 to 6.

#### 9.2.1A.2 Minimum requirements

Requirements for a particular UE belonging to certain HS-DSCH category
are determined according to the relevant part of Table 9.2.1.

The requirements are specified in terms of minimum information bit
throughput R for the DL reference channels H-set 1/2/3 specified in
Annex C.8.1.1, C.8.1.2 and C.8.1.3 respectively, with the addition of
the relevant parameters in Tables 9.2.1A.1 and 9.2.1A.3 plus the
downlink physical channel setup according to table E.5.1.

Using this configuration the throughput shall meet or exceed the minimum
requirements specified in tables 9.2.1A.2 and 9.2.1A.4.

The reference for this requirement is TS 25.101 \[1\] clauses 9.2.1.1
and 9.2.1.2.

#### 9.2.1A.3 Test purpose

To verify the ability of the receiver to receive a predefined test
signal, representing a multi-path fading channel with information bit
throughput R not falling below a specified value. The test stresses the
multicode reception and channel decoding with incremental redundancy.

#### 9.2.1A.4 Method of test

##### 9.2.1A.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: normal; see clauses G.2.1 and G.2.2.

Frequencies to be tested: mid range; see clause G.2.4.

1\) Connect the SS (node B emulator) and fader and AWGN noise source to
the UE antenna connector as shown in figure A.21 for UEs that support
receive diversity or figure A.10 for UEs that do not support receive
diversity.

2\) Set up an HSDPA call with looping back 12.2kbps RMC according to TS
34.108 \[3\] clause 7.3.6 with levels according to table E.5.0.

3\) Set the node B emulator behaviour according to table 9.2.4. Set the
test parameters for tests 1-4 according to tables 9.2.1A.1 and 9.2.1A.3
and levels according to tables 9.2.1A.5 to 9.2.1A.8 as appropriate. The
configuration of the downlink channels is defined in table E.5.1.

4\) The information bit data shall be pseudo random and not repeated
before 10 different information bit payload blocks are processed. (e.g.
Fixed reference Channel Definition H-set 1 (16 QAM): The information bit
payload block is 4664 bits long. Hence the PRBSequence must be at least
4664 \* 10 bits long. ) Use a PRBS from ITU-T O.153 Ref \[27\]

5\) The SS shall not time the transmission freely. It shall time the
transmission strictly according to the reference measurement channels:
i.e. Process number i is continued exactly after 6 TTIs.

6\) Setup the fading simulator with fading conditions as described in
table D.2.2.1.A

##### 9.2.1A.4.2 Procedure

1\) Once the HSDPA connection is setup, change levels according to
Tables E.5.6 to E.5.8B as specified by table E.5.9 and start
transmitting HSDPA Data.

2\) For all relevant propagation conditions, for all relevant Ioc
levels, for all relevant Ec/Ior, for all relevant Îor/Ioc, for all
relevant H-sets in tables 9.2.1A.5 to 9.2.1A.8 count the number of NACK,
ACK and statDTX on the UL HS-DPCCH during the test interval and decide
pass or fail according to Annex F.6.3 tables F.6.3.5.2.1 and
F.6.3.5.2.2.

#### 9.2.1A.5 Test Requirements

Tables 9.2.1A.5 to 9.2.1A.8 define the primary level settings including
test tolerance for all relevant throughput tests. The pass / fail
decision for throughput is done according to Annex F.6.3.

Tables E.5.6 to E.5.8B define the secondary and subsequently ranked
level settings including test tolerance. As those level settings are not
uniform for the throughput tests in this clause, Table E.5.9 indicates
which levels are applied, when the primary level settings (Ec/Ior and
Ior/Ioc) and propagation conditions (PA3,PB3, VA30, VA 120) vary.

### 9.2.1B Single Link Performance - QPSK, Fixed Reference Channel (FRC) H-Set 4/5

#### 9.2.1B.1 Definition and applicability

The receiver single link performance of the High Speed Physical Downlink
Shared Channel (HS-DSCH) in different multi-path fading environments are
determined by the information bit throughput R.

The requirements and this test apply to Release 5 and later releases for
all types of UTRA for the FDD UE that support HSDPA UE capability
categories 11 and 12.

#### 9.2.1B.2 Minimum requirements

Requirements for a particular UE belonging to certain HS-DSCH category
are determined according to the relevant part of Table 9.2.1.

The requirements are specified in terms of minimum information bit
throughput R for the DL reference channels H-set 4/5 specified in Annex
C.8.1.4 and C.8.1.5 respectively, with the addition of the relevant
parameters in Table 9.2.1B.1 plus the downlink physical channel setup
according to table E.5.1.

Using this configuration the throughput shall meet or exceed the minimum
requirements specified in Tables 9.2.1B.2 and 9.2.1B.3.

The reference for this requirement is TS 25.101 \[1\] clauses 9.2.1.3.

#### 9.2.1B.3 Test purpose

To verify the ability of the receiver to receive a predefined test
signal, representing a multi-path fading channel with information bit
throughput R not falling below a specified value. The test stresses the
multicode reception and channel decoding with incremental redundancy.

#### 9.2.1B.4 Method of test

##### 9.2.1B.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: normal; see clauses G.2.1 and G.2.2.

Frequencies to be tested: mid range; see clause G.2.4.

1\) Connect the SS (node B emulator) and fader and AWGN noise source to
the UE antenna connector as shown in figure A.21 for UEs that support
receive diversity or figure A.10 for UEs that do not support receive
diversity.

2\) Set up an HSDPA call with looping back 12.2kbps RMC according to TS
34.108 \[3\] clause 7.3.6 with levels according to table E.5.0.

3\) Set the node B emulator behaviour according to table 9.2.4. Set the
test parameters for tests 1-4 according to table 9.2.1B.1 and levels
according to tables 9.2.1B.4 to 9.2.1B.6 as appropriate. The
configuration of the downlink channels is defined in table E.5.1.

4\) The information bit data shall be pseudo random and not repeated
before 10 different information bit payload blocks are processed. (e.g.
Fixed reference Channel Definition H-set 5: The information bit payload
block is 3202 bits long. Hence the PRBSequence must be at least 3202 \*
10 bits long. ) Use a PRBS from ITU-T O.153 Ref \[27\]

5\) The SS shall not time the transmission freely. It shall time the
transmission strictly according to the reference measurement channels:
i.e. Process number is continued exactly after 6 TTIs.

6\) Setup the fading simulator with fading conditions as described in
table D.2.2.1.A

##### 9.2.1B.4.2 Procedure

1\) Once the HSDPA connection is setup, change levels according to
Tables E.5.6 to E.5.8B as specified by table E.5.9 and start
transmitting HSDPA Data.

2\) For all relevant propagation conditions, for all relevant Ioc
levels, for all relevant Ec/Ior, for all relevant Îor/Ioc, for all
relevant H-sets in tables 9.2.1B.4 to 9.2.1B.6 count the number of NACK,
ACK and statDTX on the UL HS-DPCCH during the test interval and decide
pass or fail according to Annex F.6.3 tables F.6.3.5.2.3 and
F.6.3.5.2.4.

#### 9.2.1B.5 Test Requirements

Tables 9.2.1B.4 to 9.2.1B.6 define the primary level settings including
test tolerance for all relevant throughput tests. The pass / fail
decision for throughput is done according to Annex F.6.3.

Tables E.5.6 to E.5.8B define the secondary and subsequently ranked
level settings including test tolerance. As those level settings are not
uniform for the throughput tests in this clause, Table E.5.9 indicates
which levels are applied, when the primary level settings (Ec/Ior and
Ior/Ioc) and propagation conditions (PA3,PB3, VA30, VA 120) vary.

### 9.2.1C Single Link Performance - QPSK/16QAM, Fixed Reference Channel (FRC) H-Set 6/3

#### 9.2.1C.1 Definition and applicability

The receiver single link performance of the High Speed Physical Downlink
Shared Channel (HS-DSCH) in different multi-path fading environments are
determined by the information bit throughput R.

The requirements and this test apply to Release 6 and later releases for
all types of UTRA for the FDD UE that support HSDPA UE capability
categories 7 - 10 but not supporting the optional enhanced performance
requirements types 1, 2, 3 or 3i.

#### 9.2.1C.2 Minimum requirements

Requirements for a particular UE belonging to certain HS-DSCH category
are determined according to the relevant part of Table 9.2.1.

The requirements are specified in terms of minimum information bit
throughput R for the DL reference channels H-set 6/3 specified in Annex
C.8.1.6 and C.8.1.3 respectively, with the addition of the relevant
parameters in Tables 9.2.1C.1, 9.2.1C.3, 9.2.1C.5 and 9.2.1C.7 plus the
downlink physical channel setup according to table E.5.1.

Using this configuration the throughput shall meet or exceed the minimum
requirements specified in Tables 9.2.1C.2, 9.2.1C.4, 9.2.1C.6, and
9.2.1C.8.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------ ----------------- ------------------

The reference for this requirement is TS 25.101 \[1\] clauses 9.2.1.1,
9.2.1.2, 9.2.1.4 and 9.2.1.5.

#### 9.2.1C.3 Test purpose

To verify the ability of the receiver to receive a predefined test
signal, representing a multi-path fading channel with information bit
throughput R not falling below a specified value. The test stresses the
multicode reception and channel decoding with incremental redundancy.

#### 9.2.1C.4 Method of test

##### 9.2.1C.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: normal; see clauses G.2.1 and G.2.2.

Frequencies to be tested: mid range; see clause G.2.4.

1\) Connect the SS (node B emulator) and fader and AWGN noise source to
the UE antenna connector as shown in figure A.10.

2\) Set up an HSDPA call with looping back 12.2kbps RMC according to TS
34.108 \[3\] clause 7.3.6 with levels according to table E.5.0.

3\) Set the node B emulator behaviour according to table 9.2.4. Set the
test parameters for tests 1-4 according to tables 9.2.1C.1, 9.2.1C.3,
9.2.1C.5 or 9.2.1C.7 and levels according to tables 9.2.1C.9 to
9.2.1C.16 respectively. The configuration of the downlink channels is
defined in table E.5.1.

4\) The information bit data shall be pseudo random and not repeated
before 10 different information bit payload blocks are processed. (e.g.
Fixed reference Channel Definition H-set 3 (16QAM): The information bit
payload block is 4664 bits long. Hence the PRBSequence must be at least
4664 \* 10 bits long. ) Use a PRBS from ITU-T O.153 Ref \[27\]

5\) The SS shall not time the transmission freely. It shall time the
transmission strictly according to the reference measurement channels:
i.e. Process number is continued exactly after 6 TTIs.

6\) Setup the fading simulator with fading conditions as described in
table D.2.2.1.A

##### 9.2.1C.4.2 Procedure

1\) Once the HSDPA connection is setup, change levels according to
Tables E.5.6 to E.5.8B as specified by table E.5.9 and start
transmitting HSDPA Data.

2\) For all relevant propagation conditions, for all relevant Ioc
levels, for all relevant Ec/Ior, for all relevant Îor/Ioc, for all
relevant H-sets in tables 9.2.1C.9 to 9.2.1C.16 count the number of
NACK, ACK and statDTX on the UL HS-DPCCH during the test interval and
decide pass or fail according to Annex F.6.3 tables F.6.3.5.2.1,
F.6.3.5.2.2, F.6.3.5.2.5 and F.6.3.5.2.6.

#### 9.2.1C.5 Test Requirements

Tables 9.2.1C.9 to 9.2.1C.16 define the primary level settings including
test tolerance for all relevant throughput tests. The pass / fail
decision for throughput is done according to Annex F.6.3.

Tables E.5.6 to E.5.8B define the secondary and subsequently ranked
level settings including test tolerance. As those level settings are not
uniform for the throughput tests in this clause, Table E.5.9 indicates
which levels are applied, when the primary level settings (Ec/Ior and
Ior/Ioc) and propagation conditions (PA3,PB3, VA30, VA 120) vary.

### 9.2.1D Single Link Performance - Enhanced Performance Requirements Type 1 - QPSK/16QAM, Fixed Reference Channel (FRC) H-Set 1/2/3

#### 9.2.1D.1 Definition and applicability

The receiver single link performance of the High Speed Physical Downlink
Shared Channel (HS-DSCH) in different multi-path fading environments are
determined by the information bit throughput R.

The requirements and this test apply for Release 6 and later releases to
all types of UTRA for the FDD UE that support: the HSDPA UE capability
categories 1 to 6 and the optional enhanced performance requirements
type 1.

#### 9.2.1D.2 Minimum requirements

The performance requirements for a particular UE belonging to certain
HS-DSCH category and supporting the optional enhanced performance
requirements type 1 are determined according to the relevant part of
Table 9.2.2.

During the Fixed Reference Channel (FRC) tests the behaviour of the
Node-B emulator in response to the ACK/NACK signalling field of the
HS-DPCCH is specified in Table 9.2.4.

The requirements are specified in terms of minimum information bit
throughput R for the DL reference channels H-set 1/2/3 specified in
Annex C.8.1.1, C.8.1.2 and C.8.1.3 respectively, with the addition of
the relevant parameters in Tables 9.2.1D.1 and 9.2.1D.3 plus the
downlink physical channel setup according to table E.5.1.

Using this configuration the throughput shall meet or exceed the minimum
requirements specified in tables 9.2.1D.2 and 9.2.1D.4.

+----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+

The reference for this requirement is TS 25.101 \[1\] clauses 9.2.1.1
and 9.2.1.2.

#### 9.2.1D.3 Test purpose

To verify the ability of the receiver to receive a predefined test
signal, representing a multi-path fading channel with information bit
throughput R not falling below a specified value. The test stresses the
multicode reception and channel decoding with incremental redundancy.

#### 9.2.1D.4 Method of test

##### 9.2.1D.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: normal; see clauses G.2.1 and G.2.2.

Frequencies to be tested: mid range; see clause G.2.4.

1\) Connect the SS (node B emulator) and faders and AWGN noise sources
to the UE antenna connectors as shown in figure A.21 for UEs that
support receive diversity or figure A.10 for UEs that do not support
receive diversity.

2\) Set up an HSDPA call with looping back 12.2kbps RMC according to TS
34.108 \[3\] clause 7.3.6 with levels according to table E.5.0.

3\) Set the node B emulator behaviour according to table 9.2.4. Set the
test parameters for tests 1-4 according to table 9.2.1D.1 or 9.2.1D.3
and the levels according to tables 9.2.1D.5 to 9.2.1D.8 as appropriate.
The configuration of the downlink channels is defined in table E.5.1.

4\) The information bit data shall be pseudo random and not repeated
before 10 different information bit payload blocks are processed. (e.g.
Fixed reference Channel Definition H-set 1 (16 QAM): The information bit
payload block is 4664 bits long. Hence the PRBSequence must be at least
4664 \* 10 bits long. ) Use a PRBS from ITU-T O.153 Ref \[27\]

5\) The SS shall not time the transmission freely. It shall time the
transmission strictly according to the reference measurement channels:
i.e. Process number i is continued exactly after 6 TTIs.

6\) Setup the fading simulators with fading conditions as described in
table D.2.2.1.A and for UEs that support receive diversity as also
described in clause D.2.5.

##### 9.2.1D.4.2 Procedure

1\) Once the HSDPA connection is setup, change levels according to
Tables E.5.6 to E.5.8B as specified by table E.5.9 and start
transmitting HSDPA Data.

2\) For all relevant propagation conditions, for all relevant Ioc
levels, for all relevant Ec/Ior, for all relevant Îor/Ioc, for all
relevant H-sets in tables 9.2.1D.5 to 9.2.1D.8 count the number of NACK,
ACK and statDTX on the UL HS-DPCCH during the test interval and decide
pass or fail according to Annex F.6.3 tables F.6.3.5.2.1A and
F.6.3.5.2.2A.

#### 9.2.1D.5 Test Requirements

Tables 9.2.1D.5 to 9.2.1D.8 define the primary level settings including
test tolerance for all relevant throughput tests. The pass / fail
decision for throughput is done according to Annex F.6.3.

Tables E.5.6 to E.5.8B define the secondary and subsequently ranked
level settings including test tolerance. As those level settings are not
uniform for the throughput tests in this clause, Table E.5.9 indicates
which levels are applied, when the primary level settings (Ec/Ior and
Ior/Ioc) and propagation conditions (PA3,PB3, VA30, VA 120) vary.

### 9.2.1E Single Link Performance - Enhanced Performance Requirements Type 1- QPSK/16QAM, Fixed Reference Channel (FRC) H-Set 6/3

#### 9.2.1E.1 Definition and applicability

The receiver single link performance of the High Speed Physical Downlink
Shared Channel (HS-DSCH) in different multi-path fading environments are
determined by the information bit throughput R.

The requirements and this test apply for Release 6 and later releases to
all types of UTRA for the FDD UE that support: HSDPA UE capability
categories 7 - 10; and the optional enhanced performance requirements
type 1.

#### 9.2.1E.2 Minimum requirements

The performance requirements for a particular UE belonging to certain
HS-DSCH category and supporting the optional enhanced performance
requirements type 1 are determined according to the relevant part of
Table 9.2.2.

During the Fixed Reference Channel (FRC) tests the behaviour of the
Node-B emulator in response to the ACK/NACK signalling field of the
HS-DPCCH is specified in Table 9.2.4.

The requirements are specified in terms of minimum information bit
throughput R for the DL reference channels H-set 6/3 specified in Annex
C.8.1.6 and C.8.1.3 respectively, with the addition of the relevant
parameters in Tables 9.2.1E.1, 9.2.1E.3, 9.2.1E.5 and 9.2.1E.7 plus the
downlink physical channel setup according to table E.5.1.

Using this configuration the throughput shall meet or exceed the minimum
requirements specified in tables 9.2.1E.2, 9.2.1E.4, 9.2.1E.6 and
9.2.1E.8.

The reference for this requirement is TS 25.101 \[1\] clauses 9.2.1.1,
9.2.1.2, 9.2.1.4, and 9.2.1.5.

#### 9.2.1E.3 Test purpose

To verify the ability of the receiver to receive a predefined test
signal, representing a multi-path fading channel with information bit
throughput R not falling below a specified value. The test stresses the
multicode reception and channel decoding with incremental redundancy.

#### 9.2.1E.4 Method of test

##### 9.2.1E.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: normal; see clauses G.2.1 and G.2.2.

Frequencies to be tested: mid range; see clause G.2.4.

1\) The SS (node B emulator) and faders and AWGN noise sources to the UE
antenna connectors as shown in figure A.21 for UEs that support receive
diversity or figure A.10 for UEs that do not support receive diversity.

2\) Set up an HSDPA call with looping back 12.2kbps RMC according to TS
34.108 \[3\] clause 7.3.6 with levels according to table E.5.0.

3\) Set the node B emulator behaviour according to table 9.2.4. Set the
test parameters for tests 1-4 according to table 9.2.1E.1, 9.2.1E.3 or
9.2.1E.5 and levels according to tables 9.2.1E.9 to 9.2.1E.16 as
appropriate. The configuration of the downlink channels is defined in
table E.5.1.

4\) The information bit data shall be pseudo random and not repeated
before 10 different information bit payload blocks are processed. (e.g.
Fixed reference Channel Definition H-set 3 (16 QAM): The information bit
payload block is 4664 bits long. Hence the PRBSequence must be at least
4664 \* 10 bits long. ) Use a PRBS from ITU-T O.153 Ref \[27\]

5\) The SS shall not time the transmission freely. It shall time the
transmission strictly according to the reference measurement channels:
i.e. Process number i is continued exactly after 6 TTIs.

6\) Setup the fading simulators with fading conditions as described in
table D.2.2.1.A and for UEs that support receive diversity as also
described in clause D.2.5.

##### 9.2.1E.4.2 Procedure

1\) Once the HSDPA connection is setup, change levels according to
Tables E.5.6 to E.5.8B as specified by table E.5.9 and start
transmitting HSDPA Data.

2\) For all relevant propagation conditions, for all relevant Ioc
levels, for all relevant Ec/Ior, for all relevant Îor/Ioc, for all
relevant H-sets in tables 9.2.1E.9 to 9.2.1E.16 count the number of
NACK, ACK and statDTX on the UL HS-DPCCH during the test interval and
decide pass or fail according to Annex F.6.3 tables F.6.3.5.2.1A,
F.6.3.5.2.2A, F.6.3.5.2.5A and F.6.3.5.2.6A.

#### 9.2.1E.5 Test Requirements

Tables 9.2.1E.9 to 9.2.1E.16 define the primary level settings including
test tolerance for all relevant throughput tests. The pass / fail
decision for throughput is done according to Annex F.6.3.

Tables E.5.6 to E.5.8B define the secondary and subsequently ranked
level settings including test tolerance. As those level settings are not
uniform for the throughput tests in this clause, Table E.5.9 indicates
which levels are applied, when the primary level settings (Ec/Ior and
Ior/Ioc) and propagation conditions (PA3,PB3, VA30, VA 120) vary.

### 9.2.1F Single Link Performance - Enhanced Performance Requirements Type 2 - QPSK/16QAM, Fixed Reference Channel (FRC) H-Set 6/3

#### 9.2.1F.1 Definition and applicability

The receiver single link performance of the High Speed Physical Downlink
Shared Channel (HS-DSCH) in different multi-path fading environments are
determined by the information bit throughput R.

The requirements and this test apply for Release 6 and later releases to
all types of UTRA for the FDD UE that support: HSDPA UE capability
categories 7 - 10 and the optional enhanced performance requirements
type 2 or type 3 or type 3i.

The requirements and this test apply also for Release 7 and later
releases to all types of UTRA for the FDD UE that support: HSDPA UE
capability categories 13-14.

#### 9.2.1F.2 Minimum requirements

The performance requirements for a particular UE belonging to a certain
HS-DSCH category and supporting the optional enhanced performance
requirements type 2 are determined according to the relevant part of
Table 9.2.3.

During the Fixed Reference Channel (FRC) tests the behaviour of the
Node-B emulator in response to the ACK/NACK signalling field of the
HS-DPCCH is specified in Table 9.2.4.

The requirements are specified in terms of minimum information bit
throughput R for the DL reference channels H-set 6/3 specified in Annex
C.8.1.6 and C.8.1.3 respectively, with the addition of the relevant
parameters in Tables 9.2.1F.1, 9.2.1F.3 and 9.2.1F.5 plus the downlink
physical channel setup according to table E.5.1.

Using this configuration the throughput shall meet or exceed the minimum
requirements specified in tables 9.2.1F.2, 9.2.1F.4 and 9.2.1F.6.

NOTE: Table 9.2.1F.6 is based on core requirements for minimum
requirement as explained in Table 9.2.3.

The reference for this requirement is TS 25.101 \[1\] clauses 9.2.1.1,
9.2.1.2, 9.2.1.4, and 9.2.1.5.

#### 9.2.1F.3 Test purpose

To verify the ability of the receiver to receive a predefined test
signal, representing a multi-path fading channel with information bit
throughput R not falling below a specified value. The test stresses the
multicode reception and channel decoding with incremental redundancy.

#### 9.2.1F.4 Method of test

##### 9.2.1F.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: normal; see clauses G.2.1 and G.2.2.

Frequencies to be tested: mid range; see clause G.2.4.

1\) Connect the SS (node B emulator) and fader and AWGN noise source to
the UE antenna connector as shown in figure A.10 for UEs that do not
support receive diversity and for UEs supporting Type 3 or 3i, or figure
A.21 for non-Type3 or 3i UEs that support receive diversity.

2\) Set up an HSDPA call with looping back 12.2kbps RMC according to TS
34.108 \[3\] clause 7.3.6 with levels according to table E.5.0.

3\) Set the node B emulator behaviour according to table 9.2.4. Set the
test parameters for tests 1-4 according to table 9.2.1F.1, 9.2.1F.3 or
9.2.1F.5 and levels according to tables 9.2.1F.7 to 9.2.1F.12 as
appropriate. The configuration of the downlink channels is defined in
table E.5.1.

4\) The information bit data shall be pseudo random and not repeated
before 10 different information bit payload blocks are processed. (e.g.
Fixed reference Channel Definition H-set 6 (16 QAM): The information bit
payload block is 9377 bits long. Hence the PRBSequence must be at least
9377 \* 10 bits long. ) Use a PRBS from ITU-T O.153 Ref \[27\]

5\) The SS shall not time the transmission freely. It shall time the
transmission strictly according to the reference measurement channels:
i.e. Process number is continued exactly after 6 TTIs.

6\) Setup the fading simulator with fading conditions as described in
table D.2.2.1.A.

##### 9.2.1F.4.2 Procedure

1\) Once the HSDPA connection is setup, change levels according to
Tables E.5.6 to E.5.8B as specified by table E.5.9 and start
transmitting HSDPA Data.

2\) For all relevant propagation conditions, for all relevant Ioc
levels, for all relevant Ec/Ior, for all relevant Îor/Ioc, for all
relevant H-sets in tables 9.2.1F.7 to 9.2.1F.12 count the number of
NACK, ACK and statDTX on the UL HS-DPCCH during the test interval and
decide pass or fail according to Annex F.6.3 tables F.6.3.5.2.1,
F.6.3.5.2.5B and F.6.3.5.2.6B.

#### 9.2.1F.5 Test Requirements

Tables 9.2.1F.7 to 9.2.1F.12 define the primary level settings including
test tolerance for all relevant throughput tests. The pass / fail
decision for throughput is done according to Annex F.6.3.

Tables E.5.6 to E.5.8B define the secondary and subsequently ranked
level settings including test tolerance. As those level settings are not
uniform for the throughput tests in this clause, Table E.5.9 indicates
which levels are applied, when the primary level settings (Ec/Ior and
Ior/Ioc) and propagation conditions (PA3,PB3, VA30, VA 120) vary.

### 9.2.1FA Single Link Performance - Enhanced Performance Requirements Type 2 - QPSK/16QAM, Fixed Reference Channel (FRC) H-Set 6A/3A

#### 9.2.1FA.1 Definition and applicability

The receiver single link performance of the High Speed Physical Downlink
Shared Channel (HS-DSCH) in different multi-path fading environments are
determined by the information bit throughput R.

The requirements and this test apply for Release 8 and later releases to
all types of UTRA for the FDD UE that support: HSDPA UE capability
categories 21 - 24 but not supporting Dual band operation.

#### 9.2.1FA.2 Minimum requirements

The performance requirements for a particular UE belonging to HS-DSCH
categories 21- 24 are determined according to the relevant part of Table
9.2.3C.

During the Fixed Reference Channel (FRC) tests the behaviour of the
Node-B emulator in response to the ACK/NACK signalling field of the
HS-DPCCH is specified in Table 9.2.4.

The requirements are specified in terms of minimum information bit
throughput R for the DL reference channels H-set 6A/3A specified in
Annex C.8.1.6 and C.8.1.3 respectively, with the addition of the
relevant parameters in Tables 9.2.1FA.1, 9.2.1FA.3 and 9.2.1FA.5 plus
the downlink physical channel setup according to table E.5.1.

Using this configuration the throughput shall meet or exceed the minimum
requirements specified in tables 9.2.1FA.2, 9.2.1FA.4 and 9.2.1FA.6.

NOTE: Table 9.2.1FA.6 is based on core requirements for minimum
requirement as explained in Table 9.2.3C.

The reference for this requirement is TS 25.101 \[1\] clauses 9.2.1.1,
9.2.1.2, 9.2.1.4, and 9.2.1.5.

#### 9.2.1FA.3 Test purpose

To verify the ability of the receiver to receive a predefined test
signal, representing a multi-path fading channel with information bit
throughput R not falling below a specified value. The test stresses the
multicode reception and channel decoding with incremental redundancy.

#### 9.2.1FA.4 Method of test

##### 9.2.1FA.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: normal; see clauses G.2.1 and G.2.2.

Frequencies to be tested: mid range; see clause G.2.4.

1\) Connect the SS (node B emulator) and fader and AWGN noise source to
the UE antenna connector as shown in figure A.35 for UEs that do not
support receive diversity and for UEs supporting Type 3 or 3i, or figure
A.37 for non-Type3 or 3i UEs that support receive diversity.

2\) Set up an HSDPA call according to TS 34.108 \[3\] clause 7.3.13 with
levels according to table E.5.0.

3\) Set the node B emulator behaviour according to table 9.2.4. Set the
test parameters for tests 1-4 according to table 9.2.1FA.1, 9.2.1FA.3 or
9.2.1FA.5 and levels according to tables 9.2.1FA.7 to 9.2.1FA.12 as
appropriate for both the serving HS-DSCH cell and secondary serving
HS-DSCH cell. The configuration of the downlink channels is defined in
table E.5.1 for the serving HS-DSCH cell, and for secondary serving
HS-DSCH cell set up P-CPICH, HS-PDSCH and HS-SCCH channels only per
table E.5.1.

4\) The information bit data shall be pseudo random and not repeated
before 10 different information bit payload blocks are processed. (e.g.
Fixed reference Channel Definition H-set 6 (16 QAM): The information bit
payload block is 9377 bits long. Hence the PRBSequence must be at least
9377 \* 10 bits long. ) Use a PRBS from ITU-T O.153 Ref \[27\]

5\) The SS shall not time the transmission freely. It shall time the
transmission strictly according to the reference measurement channels:
i.e. Process number is continued exactly after 6 TTIs.

6\) Setup the fading simulator with fading conditions on each of the
serving cells as described in table D.2.2.1.A.

##### 9.2.1FA.4.2 Procedure

1\) Once the HSDPA connection is setup, change levels according to
Tables E.5.6 to E.5.8B as specified by table E.5.9 and start
transmitting HSDPA Data on both the serving cells. For secondary serving
HS-DSCH cell only P-CPICH, HS-PDSCH and HS-SCCH are configured.

2\) For all relevant propagation conditions, for all relevant Ioc
levels, for all relevant Ec/Ior, for all relevant Îor/Ioc, for all
relevant H-sets in tables 9.2.1FA.7 to 9.2.1FA.12 count the number of
NACK, ACK and statDTX on the UL HS-DPCCH during the test interval on
both the cells and decide pass or fail according to Annex F.6.3 tables
F.6.3.5.2.1, F.6.3.5.2.5B and F.6.3.5.2.6B. Throughput shall be measured
per cell and compared to requirements in these tables.

#### 9.2.1FA.5 Test Requirements

Tables 9.2.1FA.7 to 9.2.1FA.12 define the primary level settings
including test tolerance for all relevant throughput tests. The pass /
fail decision for throughput is done according to Annex F.6.3.

Tables E.5.6 to E.5.8B define the secondary and subsequently ranked
level settings including test tolerance to be applied on both the
serving cells. As those level settings are not uniform for the
throughput tests in this clause, Table E.5.9 indicates which levels are
applied, when the primary level settings (Ec/Ior and Ior/Ioc) and
propagation conditions (PA3,PB3, VA30, VA 120) vary.

### 9.2.1FB Single Link Performance - Enhanced Performance Requirements Type 2 - QPSK/16QAM, Fixed Reference Channel (FRC) H-Set 6A/3A for DB-DC-HSDPA

#### 9.2.1FB.1 Definition and applicability

The receiver single link performance of the High Speed Physical Downlink
Shared Channel (HS-DSCH) in different multi-path fading environments are
determined by the information bit throughput R.

The requirements and this test apply for Release 9 and later releases to
all types of UTRA for the FDD UE that support DB-DC-HSDPA and HSDPA UE
capability categories 21-24.

#### 9.2.1FB.2 Minimum requirements

The performance requirements for a particular UE belonging to HS-DSCH
categories 21- 24 are determined according to the relevant part of Table
9.2.3C.

During the Fixed Reference Channel (FRC) tests the behaviour of the
Node-B emulator in response to the ACK/NACK signalling field of the
HS-DPCCH is specified in Table 9.2.4.

The requirements are specified in terms of minimum information bit
throughput R for the DL reference channels H-set 6A/3A specified in
Annex C.8.1.6 and C.8.1.3 respectively, with the addition of the
relevant parameters in Tables 9.2.1FB.1, 9.2.1FB.3 and 9.2.1FB.5 plus
the downlink physical channel setup according to table E.5.1.

Using this configuration the throughput shall meet or exceed the minimum

NOTE: Table 9.2.1FB.6 is based on core requirements for minimum
requirement as explained in Table 9.2.3C.

The reference for this requirement is TS 25.101 \[1\] clauses 9.2.1.1,
9.2.1.2, 9.2.1.4, and 9.2.1.5.

#### 9.2.1FB.3 Test purpose

To verify the ability of the receiver to receive a predefined test
signal, representing a multi-path fading channel with information bit
throughput R not falling below a specified value. The test stresses the
multicode reception and channel decoding with incremental redundancy.

#### 9.2.1FB.4 Method of test

##### 9.2.1FB.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: normal; see clauses G.2.1 and G.2.2.

Frequencies to be tested: mid range; see clause G.2.4.

1\) Connect the SS (node B emulator) and fader and AWGN noise source to
the UE antenna connector as shown in figure A.35 for UEs that do not
support receive diversity and for UEs supporting Type 3 or 3i, or figure
A.37 for non-Type3 or 3i UEs that support receive diversity.

2\) Set up an HSDPA call according to TS 34.108 \[3\] clause 7.3.13 with
levels according to table E.5.0. 3) Set the node B emulator behaviour
according to table 9.2.4. Set the test parameters for tests 1-4
according to table 9.2.1FB.1, 9.2.1FB.3 or 9.2.1FB.5 and levels
according to tables 9.2.1FB.7 to 9.2.1FB.12 as appropriate for both the
serving HS-DSCH cell and secondary serving HS-DSCH cell. The primary and
secondary serving cells are set on different bands according to
DB-DC-HSDPA configurations defined in Section 4.2. The configuration of
the downlink channels is defined in table E.5.1 for the serving HS-DSCH
cell, and for secondary serving HS-DSCH cell set up P-CPICH, HS-PDSCH
and HS-SCCH channels only per table E.5.1.

4\) The information bit data shall be pseudo random and not repeated
before 10 different information bit payload blocks are processed. (e.g.
Fixed reference Channel Definition H-set 6 (16 QAM): The information bit
payload block is 9377 bits long. Hence the PRBSequence must be at least
9377 \* 10 bits long. ) Use a PRBS from ITU-T O.153 Ref \[27\].

5\) The SS shall not time the transmission freely. It shall time the
transmission strictly according to the reference measurement channels:
i.e. Process number is continued exactly after 6 TTIs.

6\) Setup the fading simulator with fading conditions on each of the
serving cells as described in table D.2.2.1.A.

##### 9.2.1FB.4.2 Procedure

1\) Once the HSDPA connection is setup, change levels according to
Tables E.5.6 to E.5.8B as specified by table E.5.9 and start
transmitting HSDPA Data on both the serving cells. For secondary serving
HS-DSCH cell only P-CPICH, HS-PDSCH and HS-SCCH are configured.

2\) For all relevant propagation conditions, for all relevant Ioc
levels, for all relevant Ec/Ior, for all relevant Îor/Ioc, for all
relevant H-sets in tables 9.2.1FB.7 to 9.2.1FB.12 count the number of
NACK, ACK and statDTX on the UL HS-DPCCH during the test interval on
both the cells and decide pass or fail according to Annex F.6.3 tables
F.6.3.5.2.1, F.6.3.5.2.5B and F.6.3.5.2.6B. Throughput shall be measured
per cell and compared to requirements in these tables.

#### 9.2.1FB.5 Test Requirements

Tables 9.2.1FB.7 to 9.2.1FB.12 define the primary level settings
including test tolerance for all relevant throughput tests. The pass /
fail decision for throughput is done according to Annex F.6.3.

Tables E.5.6 to E.5.8B define the secondary and subsequently ranked
level settings including test tolerance to be applied on both the
serving cells. As those level settings are not uniform for the
throughput tests in this clause, Table E.5.9 indicates which levels are
applied, when the primary level settings (Ec/Ior and Ior/Ioc) and
propagation conditions (PA3,PB3, VA30, VA 120) vary.

### 9.2.1FC Single Link Performance - Enhanced Performance Requirements Type 2 - QPSK/16QAM, Fixed Reference Channel (FRC) H-Set 6B/3B

#### 9.2.1FC.1 Definition and applicability

The receiver single link performance of the High Speed Physical Downlink
Shared Channel (HS-DSCH) in different multi-path fading environments are
determined by the information bit throughput R.

The requirements and this test apply for Release 10 and later releases
to all types of UTRA for the FDD UE that support 4C-HSDPA and HSDPA UE
capability category 29.

#### 9.2.1FC.2 Minimum requirements

The performance requirements for a particular UE belonging to HS-DSCH
category 29 are determined according to the relevant part of Table
9.2.3F.

During the Fixed Reference Channel (FRC) tests the behaviour of the
Node-B emulator in response to the ACK/NACK signalling field of the
HS-DPCCH is specified in Table 9.2.4.

The requirements are specified in terms of minimum information bit
throughput R for the DL reference channels H-set 6B/3B specified in
Annex C.8.1.6 and C.8.1.3 respectively, with the addition of the
relevant parameters in Tables 9.2.1FC.1, 9.2.1FC.3 and 9.2.1FC.5 plus
the downlink physical channel setup according to table E.5.1.

Using this configuration the throughput shall meet or exceed the minimum
requirements specified in tables 9.2.1FC.2, 9.2.1FC.4 and 9.2.1FC.6.

NOTE: Table 9.2.1FC.6 is based on core requirements for minimum
requirement as explained in Table 9.2.3C.

The reference for this requirement is TS 25.101 \[1\] clauses 9.2.1.1,
9.2.1.4, and 9.2.1.5.

#### 9.2.1FC.3 Test purpose

To verify the ability of the receiver to receive a predefined test
signal, representing a multi-path fading channel with information bit
throughput R not falling below a specified value. The test stresses the
multicode reception and channel decoding with incremental redundancy.

#### 9.2.1FC.4 Method of test

##### 9.2.1FC.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: normal; see clauses G.2.1 and G.2.2.

Frequencies to be tested: mid range; see clause G.2.4.

1\) Connect the SS (node B emulator) and fader and AWGN noise source to
the UE antenna connector as shown in figure A.35 for UEs that do not
support receive diversity and for UEs supporting Type 3 or 3i, or figure
A.37 for non-Type3 or 3i UEs that support receive diversity.

2\) Set up an HSDPA call according to TS 34.108 \[3\] clause 7.3.16 with
levels according to table E.5.0.

3\) Set the node B emulator behaviour according to table 9.2.4. Set the
test parameters for tests 1-4 according to table 9.2.1FC.1, 9.2.1FC.3 or
9.2.1FC.5 and levels according to tables 9.2.1FC.7 to 9.2.1FC.12 as
appropriate for both the serving HS-DSCH cell and secondary serving
HS-DSCH cell. The configuration of the downlink channels is defined in
table E.5.1 for the serving HS-DSCH cell, and for secondary serving
HS-DSCH cell set up P-CPICH, HS-PDSCH and HS-SCCH channels only per
table E.5.1.

4\) The information bit data shall be pseudo random and not repeated
before 10 different information bit payload blocks are processed. (e.g.
Fixed reference Channel Definition H-set 6 (16 QAM): The information bit
payload block is 9377 bits long. Hence the PRBSequence must be at least
9377 \* 10 bits long. ) Use a PRBS from ITU-T O.153 Ref \[27\]

5\) The SS shall not time the transmission freely. It shall time the
transmission strictly according to the reference measurement channels:
i.e. Process number is continued exactly after 6 TTIs.

6\) Setup the fading simulator with fading conditions on each of the
serving cells as described in table D.2.2.1.A.

##### 9.2.1FC.4.2 Procedure

1\) Once the HSDPA connection is setup, change levels according to
Tables E.5.6 to E.5.8B as specified by table E.5.9 and start
transmitting HSDPA Data on both the serving cells. For secondary serving
HS-DSCH cell only P-CPICH, HS-PDSCH and HS-SCCH are configured.

2\) For all relevant propagation conditions, for all relevant Ioc
levels, for all relevant Ec/Ior, for all relevant Îor/Ioc, for all
relevant H-sets in tables 9.2.1FC.7 to 9.2.1FC.12 count the number of
NACK, ACK and statDTX on the UL HS-DPCCH during the test interval on
both the cells and decide pass or fail according to Annex F.6.3 tables
F.6.3.5.2.1, F.6.3.5.2.5B and F.6.3.5.2.6B. Throughput shall be measured
per cell and compared to requirements in these tables.

#### 9.2.1FC.5 Test Requirements

Tables 9.2.1FC.7 to 9.2.1FC.12 define the primary level settings
including test tolerance for all relevant throughput tests. The pass /
fail decision for throughput is done according to Annex F.6.3.

Tables E.5.6 to E.5.8B define the secondary and subsequently ranked
level settings including test tolerance to be applied on both the
serving cells. As those level settings are not uniform for the
throughput tests in this clause, Table E.5.9 indicates which levels are
applied, when the primary level settings (Ec/Ior and Ior/Ioc) and
propagation conditions (PA3,PB3, VA30, VA 120) vary.

### 9.2.1FD Single Link Performance - Enhanced Performance Requirements Type 2 - QPSK/16QAM, Fixed Reference Channel (FRC) H-Set 6C/3C

#### 9.2.1FD.1 Definition and applicability

The receiver single link performance of the High Speed Physical Downlink
Shared Channel (HS-DSCH) in different multi-path fading environments are
determined by the information bit throughput R.

The requirements and this test apply for Release 10 and later releases
to all types of UTRA for the FDD UE that support 4C-HSDPA and HSDPA UE
capability category 31.

#### 9.2.1FD.2 Minimum requirements

The performance requirements for a particular UE belonging to HS-DSCH
category 31 are determined according to the relevant part of Table
9.2.3F.

During the Fixed Reference Channel (FRC) tests the behaviour of the
Node-B emulator in response to the ACK/NACK signalling field of the
HS-DPCCH is specified in Table 9.2.4.

The requirements are specified in terms of minimum information bit
throughput R for the DL reference channels H-set 6C/3C specified in
Annex C.8.1.6 and C.8.1.3 respectively, with the addition of the
relevant parameters in Tables 9.2.1FD.1, 9.2.1FD.3 and 9.2.1FD.5 plus
the downlink physical channel setup according to table E.5.1.

Using this configuration the throughput shall meet or exceed the minimum
requirements specified in tables 9.2.1FD.2, 9.2.1FD.4 and 9.2.1FD.6.

NOTE: Table 9.2.1FD.6 is based on core requirements for minimum
requirement as explained in Table 9.2.3C.

The reference for this requirement is TS 25.101 \[1\] clauses 9.2.1.1,
9.2.1.4, and 9.2.1.5.

#### 9.2.1FD.3 Test purpose

To verify the ability of the receiver to receive a predefined test
signal, representing a multi-path fading channel with information bit
throughput R not falling below a specified value. The test stresses the
multicode reception and channel decoding with incremental redundancy.

#### 9.2.1FD.4 Method of test

##### 9.2.1FD.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: normal; see clauses G.2.1 and G.2.2.

Frequencies to be tested: mid range; see clause G.2.4.

1\) Connect the SS (node B emulator) and fader and AWGN noise source to
the UE antenna connector as shown in figure A.35 for UEs that do not
support receive diversity and for UEs supporting Type 3 or 3i, or figure
A.37 for non-Type3 or 3i UEs that support receive diversity.

2\) Set up an HSDPA call according to TS 34.108 \[3\] clause 7.3.16 with
levels according to table E.5.0.

3\) Set the node B emulator behaviour according to table 9.2.4. Set the
test parameters for tests 1-4 according to table 9.2.1FD.1, 9.2.1FD.3 or
9.2.1FD.5 and levels according to tables 9.2.1FD.7 to 9.2.1FD.12 as
appropriate for both the serving HS-DSCH cell and secondary serving
HS-DSCH cell. The configuration of the downlink channels is defined in
table E.5.1 for the serving HS-DSCH cell, and for secondary serving
HS-DSCH cell set up P-CPICH, HS-PDSCH and HS-SCCH channels only per
table E.5.1.

4\) The information bit data shall be pseudo random and not repeated
before 10 different information bit payload blocks are processed. (e.g.
Fixed reference Channel Definition H-set 6 (16 QAM): The information bit
payload block is 9377 bits long. Hence the PRBSequence must be at least
9377 \* 10 bits long. ) Use a PRBS from ITU-T O.153 Ref \[27\].

5\) The SS shall not time the transmission freely. It shall time the
transmission strictly according to the reference measurement channels:
i.e. Process number is continued exactly after 6 TTIs.

6\) Setup the fading simulator with fading conditions on each of the
serving cells as described in table D.2.2.1.A.

##### 9.2.1FD.4.2 Procedure

1\) Once the HSDPA connection is setup, change levels according to
Tables E.5.6 to E.5.8B as specified by table E.5.9 and start
transmitting HSDPA Data on both the serving cells. For secondary serving
HS-DSCH cell only P-CPICH, HS-PDSCH and HS-SCCH are configured.

2\) For all relevant propagation conditions, for all relevant Ioc
levels, for all relevant Ec/Ior, for all relevant Îor/Ioc, for all
relevant H-sets in tables 9.2.1FD.7 to 9.2.1FD.12 count the number of
NACK, ACK and statDTX on the UL HS-DPCCH during the test interval on
both the cells and decide pass or fail according to Annex F.6.3 tables
F.6.3.5.2.1, F.6.3.5.2.5B and F.6.3.5.2.6C. Throughput shall be measured
per cell and compared to requirements in these tables.

#### 9.2.1FD.5 Test Requirements

Tables 9.2.1FD.7 to 9.2.1FD.12 define the primary level settings
including test tolerance for all relevant throughput tests. The pass /
fail decision for throughput is done according to Annex F.6.3.

Tables E.5.6 to E.5.8B define the secondary and subsequently ranked
level settings including test tolerance to be applied on both the
serving cells. As those level settings are not uniform for the
throughput tests in this clause, Table E.5.9 indicates which levels are
applied, when the primary level settings (Ec/Ior and Ior/Ioc) and
propagation conditions (PA3,PB3, VA30, VA 120) vary.

### 9.2.1G Single Link Performance - Enhanced Performance Requirements Type 3 - QPSK/16QAM, Fixed Reference Channel (FRC) H-Set 6/3

#### 9.2.1G.1 Definition and applicability

The receiver single link performance of the High Speed Physical Downlink
Shared Channel (HS-DSCH) in different multi-path fading environments are
determined by the information bit throughput R.

The requirements and this test apply for Release 7 and later releases to
all types of UTRA for the FDD UE that support: HSDPA UE capability
categories 7, 8, 9, 10, 13 or 14, and the optional enhanced performance
requirements type 3.

The requirements and this test apply also for Release 7 and later
releases to all types of UTRA for the FDD UE that support HSDPA UE
capability categories 15 - 18.

The requirements and this test apply for Release 8 and later releases to
all types of UTRA for the FDD UE that support: HSDPA UE capability
categories 7, 8, 9, 10, 13 or 14, and the optional enhanced performance
requirements type 3i.

The requirements and this test apply also for Release 8 and later
releases to all types of UTRA for the FDD UE that support HSDPA UE
capability categories 19 - 20.

#### 9.2.1G.2 Minimum requirements

The performance requirements for a particular UE belonging to a certain
HS-DSCH category and supporting the optional enhanced performance
requirements type 3 are determined according to the relevant part of
Table 9.2.3A.

During the Fixed Reference Channel (FRC) tests the behaviour of the
Node-B emulator in response to the ACK/NACK signalling field of the
HS-DPCCH is specified in Table 9.2.4.

The requirements are specified in terms of minimum information bit
throughput R for the DL reference channels H-set 6/3 specified in Annex
C.8.1.6 and C.8.1.3 respectively, with the addition of the relevant
parameters in Tables 9.2.1G.1, 9.2.1G.4 and 9.2.1G.7 plus the downlink
physical channel setup according to table E.5.1.

Using this configuration the throughput shall meet or exceed the minimum
requirements specified in tables 9.2.1G.2, 9.2.1G.3, 9.2.1G.5, 9.2.1G.6,
and 9.2.1G.8.

NOTE: Table 9.2.1G.8 is based on core requirements for enhanced
requirements type 1 as explained in Table 9.2.3A.

The reference for this requirement is TS 25.101 \[1\] clauses 9.2.1.1,
9.2.1.2, 9.2.1.4, and 9.2.1.5.

#### 9.2.1G.3 Test purpose

To verify the ability of the receiver to receive a predefined test
signal, representing a multi-path fading channel with information bit
throughput R not falling below a specified value. The test stresses the
multicode reception and channel decoding with incremental redundancy.

#### 9.2.1G.4 Method of test

##### 9.2.1G.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: normal; see clauses G.2.1 and G.2.2.

Frequencies to be tested: mid range; see clause G.2.4.

1\) Connect the SS (node B emulator) and fader and AWGN noise source to
the UE antenna connector as shown in figure A.21 for UEs that support
receive diversity or figure A.10 for UEs that do not support receive
diversity.

2\) Set up an HSDPA call with looping back 12.2kbps RMC according to TS
34.108 \[3\] clause 7.3.6 with levels according to table E.5.0.

3\) Set the node B emulator behaviour according to table 9.2.4. Set the
test parameters for tests 1-4 according to table 9.2.1G.1, 9.2.1G.4 and
9.2.1G.7 and levels according to tables 9.2.1G.9 to 9.2.1G.16 as
appropriate. The configuration of the downlink channels is defined in
table E.5.1.

4\) The information bit data shall be pseudo random and not repeated
before 10 different information bit payload blocks are processed. (e.g.
Fixed reference Channel Definition H-set 6 (16 QAM): The information bit
payload block is 9377 bits long. Hence the PRBSequence must be at least
9377 \* 10 bits long. ) Use a PRBS from ITU-T O.153 Ref \[27\]

5\) The SS shall not time the transmission freely. It shall time the
transmission strictly according to the reference measurement channels:
i.e. Process number is continued exactly after 6 TTIs.

6\) Setup the fading simulator with fading conditions as described in
table D.2.2.1.A and clause D.2.6.

##### 9.2.1G.4.2 Procedure

1\) Once the HSDPA connection is setup, change levels according to
Tables E.5.6 to E.5.8B as specified by table E.5.9 and start
transmitting HSDPA Data.

2\) For all relevant propagation conditions, for all relevant Ioc
levels, for all relevant Ec/Ior, for all relevant Îor/Ioc, for all
relevant H-sets in tables 9.2.1G.9 to 9.2.1G.16 count the number of
NACK, ACK and statDTX on the UL HS-DPCCH during the test interval and
decide pass or fail according to Annex F.6.3 tables F.6.3.5.2.1A,
F.6.3.5.2.5C and F.6.3.5.2.6C.

#### 9.2.1G.5 Test Requirements

Tables 9.2.1G.9 to 9.2.1G.16 define the primary level settings including
test tolerance for all relevant throughput tests. The pass / fail
decision for throughput is done according to Annex F.6.3.

Tables E.5.6 to E.5.8B define the secondary and subsequently ranked
level settings including test tolerance. As those level settings are not
uniform for the throughput tests in this clause, Table E.5.9 indicates
which levels are applied, when the primary level settings (Ec/Ior and

### 9.2.1GA Single Link Performance - Enhanced Performance Requirements Type 3 - QPSK/16QAM, Fixed Reference Channel (FRC) H-Set 6A/3A

#### 9.2.1GA.1 Definition and applicability

The receiver single link performance of the High Speed Physical Downlink
Shared Channel (HS-DSCH) in different multi-path fading environments are
determined by the information bit throughput R.

The requirements and this test apply for Release 8 and later releases to
all types of UTRA for the FDD UE that support: HSDPA UE capability
categories 21-24 and support the optional enhanced performance
requirements type 3 or 3i but not support DB-DC-HSDPA operation.

The requirements and this test apply for Release 9 and later releases to
all types of UTRA for the FDD UE that support: HSDPA UE capability
categories 25-28 and support the optional enhanced performance
requirements type 3 or 3i but not support DB-DC-HSDPA operation.

#### 9.2.1GA.2 Minimum requirements

The performance requirements for a particular UE belonging to HS-DSCH
categories 21 -28 and supporting the optional enhanced performance
requirements type 3 are determined according to the relevant part of
Table 9.2.3D.

During the Fixed Reference Channel (FRC) tests the behaviour of the
Node-B emulator in response to the ACK/NACK signalling field of the
HS-DPCCH is specified in Table 9.2.4.

The requirements are specified in terms of minimum information bit
throughput R for the DL reference channels H-set 6A/3A specified in
Annex C.8.1.6 and C.8.1.3 respectively, with the addition of the
relevant parameters in Tables 9.2.1GA.1, 9.2.1GA.4 and 9.2.1GA.7 plus
the downlink physical channel setup according to table E.5.1.

Using this configuration the throughput shall meet or exceed the minimum
requirements specified in tables 9.2.1GA.2, 9.2.1GA.3, 9.2.1GA.5,
9.2.1GA.6, and 9.2.1GA.8.

NOTE: Table 9.2.1GA.8 is based on core requirements for enhanced
requirements type 1 as explained in Table 9.2.3D.

The reference for this requirement is TS 25.101 \[1\] clauses 9.2.1.1,
9.2.1.2, 9.2.1.4, and 9.2.1.5.

#### 9.2.1GA.3 Test purpose

To verify the ability of the receiver to receive a predefined test
signal, representing a multi-path fading channel with information bit
throughput R not falling below a specified value. The test stresses the
multicode reception and channel decoding with incremental redundancy.

#### 9.2.1GA.4 Method of test

##### 9.2.1GA.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: normal; see clauses G.2.1 and G.2.2.

Frequencies to be tested: mid range; see clause G.2.4.

1\) Connect the SS (node B emulator) and fader and AWGN noise source to
the UE antenna connector as shown in figure A.37 for UEs that support
receive diversity or figure A.35 for UEs that do not support receive
diversity.

2\) Set up an HSDPA call with according to TS 34.108 \[3\] clause 7.3.13
with levels according to table E.5.0.

3\) Set the node B emulator behaviour according to table 9.2.4. Set the
test parameters for tests 1-4 according to table 9.2.1GA.1, 9.2.1GA.4
and 9.2.1GA.7 and levels according to tables 9.2.1GA.9 to 9.2.1GA.16 as
appropriate for both serving HS-DSCH cell and secondary serving HS-DSCH
cell. The configuration of the downlink channels is defined in table
E.5.1 for the serving HS-DSCH cell. and for secondary serving HS-DSCH
cell set up P-CPICH, HS-PDSCH and HS-SCCH channels only per table E.5.1

4\) The information bit data shall be pseudo random and not repeated
before 10 different information bit payload blocks are processed. (e.g.
Fixed reference Channel Definition H-set 6 (16 QAM): The information bit
payload block is 9377 bits long. Hence the PRBSequence must be at least
9377 \* 10 bits long. ) Use a PRBS from ITU-T O.153 Ref \[27\]

5\) The SS shall not time the transmission freely. It shall time the
transmission strictly according to the reference measurement channels:
i.e. Process number is continued exactly after 6 TTIs.

6\) Setup the fading simulator with fading conditions as described in
table D.2.2.1.A and clause D.2.6 on each of the serving cells..

##### 9.2.1GA.4.2 Procedure

1\) Once the HSDPA connection is setup, change levels according to
Tables E.5.6 to E.5.8B as specified by table E.5.9 and start
transmitting HSDPA Data on both the serving cells For secondary serving
HS-DSCH cell only P-CPICH, HS-PDSCH and HS-SCCH are configured.

2\) For all relevant propagation conditions, for all relevant Ioc
levels, for all relevant Ec/Ior, for all relevant Îor/Ioc, for all
relevant H-sets in tables 9.2.1GA.9 to 9.2.1GA.16 count the number of
NACK, ACK and statDTX on the UL HS-DPCCH during the test interval on
both the cells and decide pass or fail according to Annex F.6.3 tables
F.6.3.5.2.5C and F.6.3.5.2.6C. Throughput shall be measured per cell and
compared to requirements in these tables.

##### 9.2.1GA.5 Test Requirements

Tables 9.2.1GA.9 to 9.2.1GA.16 define the primary level settings
including test tolerance for all relevant throughput tests. The pass /
fail decision for throughput is done according to AnnexF.6.3.

Tables E.5.6 to E.5.8B define the secondary and subsequently ranked
level settings including test tolerance for both the serving cells. As
those level settings are not uniform for the throughput tests in this
clause, Table E.5.9 indicates which levels are applied, when the primary
level settings (Ec/Ior and Ior/Ioc) and propagation conditions (PA3,PB3,
VA30, VA 120) vary.

### 9.2.1GB Single Link Performance - Enhanced Performance Requirements Type 3 - QPSK/16QAM, Fixed Reference Channel (FRC) H-Set 6A/3A for DB-DC-HSDPA

#### 9.2.1GB.1 Definition and applicability

The receiver single link performance of the High Speed Physical Downlink
Shared Channel (HS-DSCH) in different multi-path fading environments are
determined by the information bit throughput R.

The requirements and this test apply for Release 9 and later releases to
all types of UTRA for the FDD UE that support: DB-DC-HSDPA and HSDPA UE
capability categories 21-28 and support the optional enhanced
performance requirements type 3 or 3i.

DB-DC-HSDPA is designed to operate in configurations specified in clause
4.2.

#### 9.2.1GB.2 Minimum requirements

The performance requirements for a particular UE belonging to HS-DSCH
categories 21 -28 and supporting the optional enhanced performance
requirements type 3 are determined according to the relevant part of
Table 9.2.3D.

During the Fixed Reference Channel (FRC) tests the behaviour of the
Node-B emulator in response to the ACK/NACK signalling field of the
HS-DPCCH is specified in Table 9.2.4.

The requirements are specified in terms of minimum information bit
throughput R for the DL reference channels H-set 6A/3A specified in
Annex C.8.1.6 and C.8.1.3 respectively, with the addition of the
relevant parameters in Tables 9.2.1GB.1, 9.2.1GB.4 and 9.2.1GB.7 plus
the downlink physical channel setup according to table E.5.1.

Using this configuration the throughput shall meet or exceed the minimum
requirements specified in tables 9.2.1GB.2, 9.2.1GB.3, 9.2.1GB.5,
9.2.1GB.6, and 9.2.1GB.8.

NOTE: Table 9.2.1GB.8 is based on core requirements for enhanced
requirements type 1 as explained in Table 9.2.3D.

The reference for this requirement is TS 25.101 \[1\] clauses 9.2.1.1,
9.2.1.2, 9.2.1.4, and 9.2.1.5.

#### 9.2.1GB.3 Test purpose

To verify the ability of the receiver to receive a predefined test
signal, representing a multi-path fading channel with information bit
throughput R not falling below a specified value. The test stresses the
multicode reception and channel decoding with incremental redundancy.

#### 9.2.1GB.4 Method of test

##### 9.2.1GB.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: normal; see clauses G.2.1 and G.2.2.

Frequencies to be tested: mid range; see clause G.2.4.

1\) Connect the SS (node B emulator) and fader and AWGN noise source to
the UE antenna connector as shown in figure A.37 for UEs that support
receive diversity or figure A.35 for UEs that do not support receive
diversity.

2\) Set up an HSDPA call with according to TS 34.108 \[3\] clause 7.3.13
with levels according to table E.5.0.

3\) Set the node B emulator behaviour according to table 9.2.4. Set the
test parameters for tests 1-4 according to table 9.2.1GB.1, 9.2.1GB.4
and 9.2.1GB.7 and levels according to tables 9.2.1GB.9 to 9.2.1GB.16 as
appropriate for both serving HS-DSCH cell and secondary serving HS-DSCH
cell. The primary and secondary serving cells are set on different bands
according to DB-DC-HSDPA configurations defined in Section 4.2. The
configuration of the downlink channels is defined in table E.5.1 for the
serving HS-DSCH cell. and for secondary serving HS-DSCH cell set up
P-CPICH, HS-PDSCH and HS-SCCH channels only per table E.5.1

4\) The information bit data shall be pseudo random and not repeated
before 10 different information bit payload blocks are processed. (e.g.
Fixed reference Channel Definition H-set 6 (16 QAM): The information bit
payload block is 9377 bits long. Hence the PRBSequence must be at least
9377 \* 10 bits long. ) Use a PRBS from ITU-T O.153 Ref \[27\]

5\) The SS shall not time the transmission freely. It shall time the
transmission strictly according to the reference measurement channels:
i.e. Process number is continued exactly after 6 TTIs.

6\) Setup the fading simulator with fading conditions as described in
table D.2.2.1.A and clause D.2.6 on each of the serving cells..

##### 9.2.1GB.4.2 Procedure

1\) Once the HSDPA connection is setup, change levels according to
Tables E.5.6 to E.5.8B as specified by table E.5.9 and start
transmitting HSDPA Data on both the serving cells For secondary serving
HS-DSCH cell only P-CPICH, HS-PDSCH and HS-SCCH are configured.

2\) For all relevant propagation conditions, for all relevant Ioc
levels, for all relevant Ec/Ior, for all relevant Îor/Ioc, for all
relevant H-sets in tables 9.2.1GB.9 to 9.2.1GB.16 count the number of
NACK, ACK and statDTX on the UL HS-DPCCH during the test interval on
both the cells and decide pass or fail according to Annex F.6.3 tables
F.6.3.5.2.5C and F.6.3.5.2.6C. Throughput shall be measured per cell and
compared to requirements in these tables.

##### 9.2.1GB.5 Test Requirements

Tables 9.2.1GB.9 to 9.2.1GB.16 define the primary level settings
including test tolerance for all relevant throughput tests. The pass /
fail decision for throughput is done according to AnnexF.6.3.

Tables E.5.6 to E.5.8B define the secondary and subsequently ranked
level settings including test tolerance for both the serving cells. As
those level settings are not uniform for the throughput tests in this
clause, Table E.5.9 indicates which levels are applied, when the primary
level settings (Ec/Ior and Ior/Ioc) and propagation conditions (PA3,
PB3, VA30, VA120) vary.

### 9.2.1GC Single Link Performance - Enhanced Performance Requirements Type 3 - QPSK/16QAM, Fixed Reference Channel (FRC) H-Set 6B/3B

\- -

#### 9.2.1GC.1 Definition and applicability

The receiver single link performance of the High Speed Physical Downlink
Shared Channel (HS-DSCH) in different multi-path fading environments are
determined by the information bit throughput R.

The requirements and this test apply for Release 10 and later releases
to all types of UTRA for the FDD UE that support 4C-HSDPA and HSDPA UE
capability categories 29 or 30 and support the optional enhanced
performance requirements type 3 or 3i.

#### 9.2.1GC.2 Minimum requirements

The performance requirements for a particular UE belonging to HS-DSCH
categories 29-30 and supporting the optional enhanced performance
requirements type 3 are determined according to the relevant part of
Table 9.2.3H

During the Fixed Reference Channel (FRC) tests the behaviour of the
Node-B emulator in response to the ACK/NACK signalling field of the
HS-DPCCH is specified in Table 9.2.4.

The requirements are specified in terms of minimum information bit
throughput R for the DL reference channels H-set 6B/3B specified in
Annex C.8.1.6 and C.8.1.3 respectively, with the addition of the
relevant parameters in Tables 9.2.1GC.1, 9.2.1GC.4 and 9.2.1GC.7 plus
the downlink physical channel setup according to table E.5.1.

Using this configuration the throughput shall meet or exceed the minimum
requirements specified in tables 9.2.1GC.2, 9.2.1GC.3, 9.2.1GC.5,
9.2.1GC.6, and 9.2.1GC.8.

NOTE: Table 9.2.1GC.8 is based on core requirements for enhanced
requirements type 3 as explained in Table 9.2.3H.

The reference for this requirement is TS 25.101 \[1\] clauses 9.2.1.1,
9.2.1.4, and 9.2.1.5.

#### 9.2.1GC.3 Test purpose

To verify the ability of the receiver to receive a predefined test
signal, representing a multi-path fading channel with information bit
throughput R not falling below a specified value. The test stresses the
multicode reception and channel decoding with incremental redundancy.

#### 9.2.1GC.4 Method of test

##### 9.2.1GC.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: normal; see clauses G.2.1 and G.2.2.

Frequencies to be tested: mid range; see clause G.2.4.

1\) Connect the SS (node B emulator) and fader and AWGN noise source to
the UE antenna connector as shown in figure 47 for UEs that support
receive diversity or figure 46 for UEs that do not support receive
diversity.

2\) Set up an HSDPA call with according to TS 34.108 \[3\] clause 7.3.16
with levels according to table E.5.0.

3\) Set the node B emulator behaviour according to table 9.2.4. Set the
test parameters for tests 1-4 according to table 9.2.1GC.1, 9.2.1GC.4
and 9.2.1GC.7 and levels according to tables 9.2.1GC.9 to 9.2.1GC.16 as
appropriate for serving HS-DSCH cell and secondary HS-DSCH cells. The
configuration of the downlink channels is defined in table E.5.1A and is
to be applied to serving HS-DSCH cell and for secondary serving HS-DSCH
cells set up P-CPICH, HS-PDSCH and HS-SCCH channels only per table
E.5.1.

4\) The information bit data shall be pseudo random and not repeated
before 10 different information bit payload blocks are processed. (e.g.
Fixed reference Channel Definition H-set 6 (16 QAM): The information bit
payload block is 9377 bits long. Hence the PRBSequence must be at least
9377 \* 10 bits long. ) Use a PRBS from ITU-T O.153 Ref \[27\].

5\) The SS shall not time the transmission freely. It shall time the
transmission strictly according to the reference measurement channels:
i.e. Process number is continued exactly after 6 TTIs.

6\) Setup the fading simulator with fading conditions as described in
table D.2.2.1.A and clause D.2.6 on each of the serving cells.

##### 9.2.1GC.4.2 Procedure

1\) Once the HSDPA connection is setup, change levels according to
Tables E.5.6 to E.5.8B as specified by table E.5.9 and start
transmitting HSDPA Data on all the cells. For secondary serving HS-DSCH
cells only P-CPICH, HS-PDSCH and HS-SCCH are configured.

2\) For all relevant propagation conditions, for all relevant Ioc
levels, for all relevant Ec/Ior, for all relevant Îor/Ioc, for all
relevant H-sets in tables 9.2.1GC.9 to 9.2.1GC.16 count the number of
NACK, ACK and statDTX on the UL HS-DPCCH during the test interval on
both the cells and decide pass or fail according to Annex F.6.3 tables
F.6.3.5.2.5C and F.6.3.5.2.6C. Throughput shall be measured per cell and
compared to requirements in these tables.

##### 9.2.1GC.5 Test Requirements

Tables 9.2.1GC.9 to 9.2.1GC.16 define the primary level settings
including test tolerance for all relevant throughput tests. The pass /
fail decision for throughput is done according to Annex F.6.3.

Tables E.5.6 to E.5.8B define the secondary and subsequently ranked
level settings including test tolerance for serving cells. As those
level settings are not uniform for the throughput tests in this clause,
Table E.5.9 indicates which levels are applied, when the primary level
settings (Ec/Ior and Ior/Ioc) and propagation conditions (PA3, PB3,
VA30, VA120) vary.

### 9.2.1GD Single Link Performance - Enhanced Performance Requirements Type 3 - QPSK/16QAM, Fixed Reference Channel (FRC) H-Set 6C/3C

#### 9.2.1GD.1 Definition and applicability

The receiver single link performance of the High Speed Physical Downlink
Shared Channel (HS-DSCH) in different multi-path fading environments are
determined by the information bit throughput R.

The requirements and this test apply for Release 10 and later releases
to all types of UTRA for the FDD UE that support 4C-HSDPA and HSDPA UE
capability categories 31 or 32 and support the optional enhanced
performance requirements type 3 or 3i.

#### 9.2.1GD.2 Minimum requirements

The performance requirements for a particular UE belonging to HS-DSCH
categories 31-32 and supporting the optional enhanced performance
requirements type 3 are determined according to the relevant part of
Table 9.2.3H

During the Fixed Reference Channel (FRC) tests the behaviour of the
Node-B emulator in response to the ACK/NACK signalling field of the
HS-DPCCH is specified in Table 9.2.4.

The requirements are specified in terms of minimum information bit
throughput R for the DL reference channels H-Set 6C/3C specified in
Annex C.8.1.6 and C.8.1.3 respectively, with the addition of the
relevant parameters in Tables 9.2.1GD.1, 9.2.1GD.4 and 9.2.1GD.7 plus
the downlink physical channel setup according to table E.5.1.

Using this configuration the throughput shall meet or exceed the minimum
requirements specified in tables 9.2.1GD.2, 9.2.1GD.3, 9.2.1GD.5,
9.2.1GD.6, and 9.2.1GD.8.

NOTE: Table 9.2.1GD.8 is based on core requirements for enhanced
requirements type 3 as explained in Table 9.2.3H.

The reference for this requirement is TS 25.101 \[1\] clauses 9.2.1.1,
9.2.1.4, and 9.2.1.5.

#### 9.2.1GD.3 Test purpose

To verify the ability of the receiver to receive a predefined test
signal, representing a multi-path fading channel with information bit
throughput R not falling below a specified value. The test stresses the
multicode reception and channel decoding with incremental redundancy.

#### 9.2.1GD.4 Method of test

##### 9.2.1GD.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: normal; see clauses G.2.1 and G.2.2.

Frequencies to be tested: mid range; see clause G.2.4.

1\) Connect the SS (node B emulator) and fader and AWGN noise source to
the UE antenna connector as shown in figure 47 for UEs that support
receive diversity or figure 46 for UEs that do not support receive
diversity.

2\) Set up an HSDPA call with according to TS 34.108 \[3\] clause 7.3.16
with levels according to table E.5.0.

3\) Set the node B emulator behaviour according to table 9.2.4. Set the
test parameters for tests 1-4 according to table 9.2.1GD.1, 9.2.1GD.4
and 9.2.1GD.7 and levels according to tables 9.2.1GD.9 to 9.2.1GD.16 as
appropriate for both serving HS-DSCH cell and secondary HS-DSCH cells.
The configuration of the downlink channels is defined in table E.5.1A
and is to be applied to serving HS-DSCH cell and for secondary serving
HS-DSCH cells set up P-CPICH, HS-PDSCH and HS-SCCH channels only per
table E.5.1.

4\) The information bit data shall be pseudo random and not repeated
before 10 different information bit payload blocks are processed. (e.g.
Fixed reference Channel Definition H-set 6 (16 QAM): The information bit
payload block is 9377 bits long. Hence the PRBSequence must be at least
9377 \* 10 bits long. ) Use a PRBS from ITU-T O.153 Ref \[27\].

5\) The SS shall not time the transmission freely. It shall time the
transmission strictly according to the reference measurement channels:
i.e. Process number is continued exactly after 6 TTIs.

6\) Setup the fading simulator with fading conditions as described in
table D.2.2.1.A and clause D.2.6 on each of the serving cells.

##### 9.2.1GD.4.2 Procedure

1\) Once the HSDPA connection is setup, change levels according to
Tables E.5.6 to E.5.8B as specified by table E.5.9 and start
transmitting HSDPA Data on all the cells. For secondary serving HS-DSCH
cells only P-CPICH, HS-PDSCH and HS-SCCH are configured.

2\) For all relevant propagation conditions, for all relevant Ioc
levels, for all relevant Ec/Ior, for all relevant Îor/Ioc, for all
relevant H-sets in tables 9.2.1GD.9 to 9.2.1GD.16 count the number of
NACK, ACK and statDTX on the UL HS-DPCCH during the test interval on
both the cells and decide pass or fail according to Annex F.6.3 tables
F.6.3.5.2.5C and F.6.3.5.2.6C. Throughput shall be measured per cell and
compared to requirements in these tables.

##### 9.2.1GD.5 Test Requirements

Tables 9.2.1GD.9 to 9.2.1GD.16 define the primary level settings
including test tolerance for all relevant throughput tests. The pass /
fail decision for throughput is done according to AnnexF.6.3.

Tables E.5.6 to E.5.8B define the secondary and subsequently ranked
level settings including test tolerance for serving cells. As those
level settings are not uniform for the throughput tests in this clause,
Table E.5.9 indicates which levels are applied, when the primary level
settings (Ec/Ior and Ior/Ioc) and propagation conditions (PA3, PB3,
VA30, VA120) vary.

### 9.2.1H Single Link Performance - Enhanced Performance Requirements Type 2 - 64QAM, Fixed Reference Channel (FRC) H-Set 8 

#### 9.2.1H.1 Definition and applicability

The receiver single link performance of the High Speed Physical Downlink
Shared Channel (HS-DSCH) in different multi-path fading environments are
determined by the information bit throughput R.

The requirements and this test apply for Release 7 and later releases to
all types of UTRA for the FDD UE that support: HSDPA UE capability
categories 13 and 14 but not the optional enhanced performance
requirements Type 3 or Type 3i.

#### 9.2.1H.2 Minimum requirements

The performance requirements for a particular UE belonging to HS-DSCH
categories 13 and 14 and supporting the optional enhanced performance
requirements type 2 are determined according to the relevant part of
Table 9.2.3.

During the Fixed Reference Channel (FRC) tests the behaviour of the
Node-B emulator in response to the ACK/NACK signalling field of the
HS-DPCCH is specified in Table 9.2.4.

The requirements are specified in terms of minimum information bit
throughput R for the DL reference channels H-set 8 specified in Annex
C.8.1.8, with the addition of the relevant parameters in Table 9.2.1H.1
plus the downlink physical channel setup according to table E.5.1A.

Using this configuration the throughput shall meet or exceed the minimum
requirements specified in tables 9.2.1H.2.

The reference for this requirement is TS 25.101 \[1\] clause 9.2.1.6.

#### 9.2.1H.3 Test purpose

To verify the ability of the receiver to receive a predefined test
signal, representing a multi-path fading channel with information bit
throughput R not falling below a specified value. The test stresses the
multicode reception and channel decoding with incremental redundancy.

#### 9.2.1H.4 Method of test

##### 9.2.1H.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: normal; see clauses G.2.1 and G.2.2.

Frequencies to be tested: mid range; see clause G.2.4.

1\) Connect the SS (node B emulator) and fader and AWGN noise source to
the UE antenna connector as shown in figure A.21 for UEs that support
receive diversity or figure A.10 for UEs that do not support receive
diversity.

2\) Set up an HSDPA call with looping back 12.2kbps RMC according to TS
34.108 \[3\] clause 7.3.6 with exceptions for information elements
listed in table 9.2.1H.2A and with levels according to table E.5.0.

3\) Set the node B emulator behaviour according to table 9.2.4. Set the
test parameters for test 1 according to table 9.2.1H.1 and levels
according to tables 9.2.1H.3 and 9.2.1H.4 as appropriate. The
configuration of the downlink channels is defined in table E.5.1A.

4\) The information bit data shall be pseudo random and not repeated
before 10 different information bit payload blocks are processed. (e.g.
Fixed reference Channel Definition H-set 8 (64 QAM): The information bit
payload block is 26600 bits long. Hence the PRBSequence must be at least
26600 \* 10 bits long.) Use a PRBS from ITU-T O.153 Ref \[27\].

5\) The SS shall not time the transmission freely. It shall time the
transmission strictly according to the reference measurement channels:
i.e. Process number is continued exactly after 6 TTIs.

6\) Setup the fading simulator with fading conditions as described in
table D.2.2.1.A.

##### 9.2.1H.4.2 Procedure

1\) Once the HSDPA connection is setup, change levels according to
Tables E.5.6 to E.5.8C as specified by table E.5.9 and start
transmitting HSDPA Data.

2\) For all relevant propagation conditions, for all relevant Ioc
levels, for all relevant Ec/Ior, for all relevant Îor/Ioc,1 for all
relevant H-sets in tables 9.2.1H.3 and 9.2.1H.4 count the number of
NACK, ACK and statDTX on the UL HS-DPCCH during the test interval and
decide pass or fail according to Annex F.6.3 table F.6.3.5.2.7.

#### 9.2.1H.5 Test Requirements

Tables 9.2.1H.3 and 9.2.1H.4 define the primary level settings including
test tolerance for all relevant throughput tests. The pass / fail
decision for throughput is done according to Annex F.6.3.

Tables E.5.6 to E.5.8C define the secondary and subsequently ranked
level settings including test tolerance. As those level settings are not
uniform for the throughput tests in this clause, Table E.5.9 indicates
which levels are applied, when the primary level settings (Ec/Ior and
Ior/Ioc) and propagation conditions (PA3) vary.

### 9.2.1HA Single Link Performance - Enhanced Performance Requirements Type 2 - 64QAM, Fixed Reference Channel (FRC) H-Set 8 A

#### 9.2.1HA.1 Definition and applicability

The receiver single link performance of the High Speed Physical Downlink
Shared Channel (HS-DSCH) in different multi-path fading environments are
determined by the information bit throughput R.

The requirements and this test apply for Release 8 and later releases to
all types of UTRA for the FDD UE that support: HSDPA UE capability
categories 23-24 but not the optional enhanced performance requirements
Type 3 or Type 3i and not supporting Dual band operation.

#### 9.2.1HA.2 Minimum requirements

The performance requirements for a particular UE belonging to HS-DSCH
categories 23 -24 are determined according to the relevant part of
Table9.2.3C.

During the Fixed Reference Channel (FRC) tests the behaviour of the
Node-B emulator in response to the ACK/NACK signalling field of the
HS-DPCCH is specified in Table 9.2.4.

The requirements are specified in terms of minimum information bit
throughput R for the DL reference channels H-set 8A specified in Annex
C.8.1.8, with the addition of the relevant parameters in Table 9.2.1HA.1
plus the downlink physical channel setup according to table E.5.1A.

Using this configuration the throughput shall meet or exceed the minimum
requirements specified in tables 9.2.1HA.2.

The reference for this requirement is TS 25.101 \[1\] clause 9.2.1.6.

#### 9.2.1HA.3 Test purpose

To verify the ability of the receiver to receive a predefined test
signal, representing a multi-path fading channel with information bit
throughput R not falling below a specified value. The test stresses the
multicode reception and channel decoding with incremental redundancy.

#### 9.2.1HA.4 Method of test

##### 9.2.1HA.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: normal; see clauses G.2.1 and G.2.2.

Frequencies to be tested: mid range; see clause G.2.4.

1\) Connect the SS (node B emulator) and fader and AWGN noise source to
the UE antenna connector as shown in figure A.37 for UEs that support
receive diversity or figure A.35 for UEs that do not support receive
diversity.

2\) Set up an HSDPA call according to TS 34.108 \[3\] clause 7.3.13 with
exceptions for information elements listed in table 9.2.1HA.2A and with
levels according to table E.5.0.

3\) Set the node B emulator behaviour according to table 9.2.4. Set the
test parameters for test 1 according to table 9.2.1HA.1 and levels
according to tables 9.2.1HA.3 and 9.2.1HA.4 as appropriate on both
serving HS-DSCH cell and secondary serving HS-DSCH cell. The
configuration of the downlink channels is defined in table E.5.1A and is
to be applied to serving HS-DSCH cell. and for secondary serving HS-DSCH
cell set up P-CPICH, HS-PDSCH and HS-SCCH channels only per table
E.5.1A.

4\) The information bit data shall be pseudo random and not repeated
before 10 different information bit payload blocks are processed. (e.g.
Fixed reference Channel Definition H-set 8 (64 QAM): The information bit
payload block is 26600 bits long. Hence the PRBSequence must be at least
26600 \* 10 bits long.) Use a PRBS from ITU-T O.153 Ref \[27\].

5\) The SS shall not time the transmission freely. It shall time the
transmission strictly according to the reference measurement channels:
i.e. Process number is continued exactly after 6 TTIs.

6\) Setup the fading simulator with fading conditions as described in
table D.2.2.1.A.

##### 9.2.1HA.4.2 Procedure

1\) Once the HSDPA connection is setup, change levels according to
Tables E.5.6 to E.5.8B as specified by table E.5.9 and start
transmitting HSDPA Data on both serving cells For secondary serving
HS-DSCH cell only P-CPICH, HS-PDSCH and HS-SCCH are configured.

2\) For all relevant propagation conditions, for all relevant Ioc
levels, for all relevant Ec/Ior, for all relevant Îor/Ioc,1 for all
relevant H-sets in tables 9.2.1HA.3 and 9.2.1HA.4 count the number of
NACK, ACK and statDTX on the UL HS-DPCCH during the test interval on
both the cells and decide pass or fail according to Annex F.6.3 table
F.6.3.5.2.7 Throughput shall be measured per cell and compared to
requirements in table F.6.3.5.2.7.

##### 9.2.1HA.5 Test Requirements

Tables 9.2.1HA.3 and 9.2.1HA.4 define the primary level settings
including test tolerance for all relevant throughput tests to be applied
to both serving cells. The pass / fail decision for throughput is done
according to Annex F.6.3.

Tables E.5.6 to E.5.8B define the secondary and subsequently ranked
level settings including test tolerance to be applied to both serving
cells. As those level settings are not uniform for the throughput tests
in this clause, Table E.5.9 indicates which levels are applied, when the
primary level settings (Ec/Ior and Ior/Ioc) and propagation conditions
(PA3) vary.

### 9.2.1HB Single Link Performance - Enhanced Performance Requirements Type 2 - 64QAM, Fixed Reference Channel (FRC) H-Set 8 A for DB-DC-HSDPA

#### 9.2.1HB.1 Definition and applicability

The receiver single link performance of the High Speed Physical Downlink
Shared Channel (HS-DSCH) in different multi-path fading environments are
determined by the information bit throughput R.

The requirements and this test apply for Release 9 and later releases to
all types of UTRA for the FDD UE that support DB-DC-HSDPA and HSDPA UE
capability categories 23-24 but not the optional enhanced performance
requirements Type 3 or Type 3i.

#### 9.2.1HB.2 Minimum requirements

The performance requirements for a particular UE belonging to HS-DSCH
categories 23 -24 are determined according to the relevant part of
Table9.2.3C.

During the Fixed Reference Channel (FRC) tests the behaviour of the
Node-B emulator in response to the ACK/NACK signalling field of the
HS-DPCCH is specified in Table 9.2.4.

The requirements are specified in terms of minimum information bit
throughput R for the DL reference channels H-set 8A specified in Annex
C.8.1.8, with the addition of the relevant parameters in Table 9.2.1HB.1
plus the downlink physical channel setup according to table E.5.1A.

Using this configuration the throughput shall meet or exceed the minimum
requirements specified in tables 9.2.1HB.2.

The reference for this requirement is TS 25.101 \[1\] clause 9.2.1.6.

#### 9.2.1HB.3 Test purpose

To verify the ability of the receiver to receive a predefined test
signal, representing a multi-path fading channel with information bit
throughput R not falling below a specified value. The test stresses the
multicode reception and channel decoding with incremental redundancy.

#### 9.2.1HB.4 Method of test

##### 9.2.1HB.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: normal; see clauses G.2.1 and G.2.2.

Frequencies to be tested: mid range; see clause G.2.4.

1\) Connect the SS (node B emulator) and fader and AWGN noise source to
the UE antenna connector as shown in figure A.37 for UEs that support
receive diversity or figure A.35 for UEs that do not support receive
diversity.

2\) Set up an HSDPA call according to TS 34.108 \[3\] clause 7.3.13 with
exceptions for information elements listed in table 9.2.1HB.2A and with
levels according to table E.5.0.

3\) Set the node B emulator behaviour according to table 9.2.4. Set the
test parameters for test 1 according to table 9.2.1HB.1 and levels
according to tables 9.2.1HB.3 and 9.2.1HB.4 as appropriate on both
serving HS-DSCH cell and secondary serving HS-DSCH cell. The primary and
secondary serving cells are set on different bands according to
DB-DC-HSDPA configurations defined in Section 4.2. The configuration of
the downlink channels is defined in table E.5.1A and is to be applied to
serving HS-DSCH cell. and for secondary serving HS-DSCH cell set up
P-CPICH, HS-PDSCH and HS-SCCH channels only per table E.5.1A.

4\) The information bit data shall be pseudo random and not repeated
before 10 different information bit payload blocks are processed. (e.g.
Fixed reference Channel Definition H-set 8 (64 QAM): The information bit
payload block is 26600 bits long. Hence the PRBSequence must be at least
26600 \* 10 bits long.) Use a PRBS from ITU-T O.153 Ref \[27\].

5\) The SS shall not time the transmission freely. It shall time the
transmission strictly according to the reference measurement channels:
i.e. Process number is continued exactly after 6 TTIs.

6\) Setup the fading simulator with fading conditions as described in
table D.2.2.1.A.

##### 9.2.1HB.4.2 Procedure

1\) Once the HSDPA connection is setup, change levels according to
Tables E.5.6 to E.5.8B as specified by table E.5.9 and start
transmitting HSDPA Data on both serving cells For secondary serving
HS-DSCH cell only P-CPICH, HS-PDSCH and HS-SCCH are configured.

2\) For all relevant propagation conditions, for all relevant Ioc
levels, for all relevant Ec/Ior, for all relevant Îor/Ioc,1 for all
relevant H-sets in tables 9.2.1HB.3 and 9.2.1HB.4 count the number of
NACK, ACK and statDTX on the UL HS-DPCCH during the test interval on
both the cells and decide pass or fail according to Annex F.6.3 table
F.6.3.5.2.7 Throughput shall be measured per cell and compared to
requirements in table F.6.3.5.2.7.

##### 9.2.1HB.5 Test Requirements

Tables 9.2.1HB.3 and 9.2.1HB.4 define the primary level settings
including test tolerance for all relevant throughput tests to be applied
to both serving cells. The pass / fail decision for throughput is done
according to Annex F.6.3.

Tables E.5.6 to E.5.8B define the secondary and subsequently ranked
level settings including test tolerance to be applied to both serving
cells. As those level settings are not uniform for the throughput tests
in this clause, Table E.5.9 indicates which levels are applied, when the
primary level settings (Ec/Ior and Ior/Ioc) and propagation conditions
(PA3) vary.

### 9.2.1HC Single Link Performance - Enhanced Performance Requirements Type 2 - 64QAM, Fixed Reference Channel (FRC) H-Set 8B

#### 9.2.1HC.1 Definition and applicability

The receiver single link performance of the High Speed Physical Downlink
Shared Channel (HS-DSCH) in different multi-path fading environments are
determined by the information bit throughput R.

The requirements and this test apply for Release 10 and later releases
to all types of UTRA for the FDD UE that support 4C-HSDPA and HSDPA UE
capability category 29 but not the optional enhanced performance
requirements Type 3 or Type 3i.

#### 9.2.1HC.2 Minimum requirements

The performance requirements for a particular UE belonging to HS-DSCH
category 29 are determined according to the relevant part of Table
9.2.3F.

During the Fixed Reference Channel (FRC) tests the behaviour of the
Node-B emulator in response to the ACK/NACK signalling field of the
HS-DPCCH is specified in Table 9.2.4.

The requirements are specified in terms of minimum information bit
throughput R for the DL reference channels H-Set 8B specified in Annex
C.8.1.8, with the addition of the relevant parameters in Table 9.2.1HC.1
plus the downlink physical channel setup according to table E.5.1A.

Using this configuration the throughput shall meet or exceed the minimum
requirements specified in tables 9.2.1HC.2.

The reference for this requirement is TS 25.101 \[1\] clause 9.2.1.6.

#### 9.2.1HC.3 Test purpose

To verify the ability of the receiver to receive a predefined test
signal, representing a multi-path fading channel with information bit
throughput R not falling below a specified value. The test stresses the
multicode reception and channel decoding with incremental redundancy.

#### 9.2.1HC.4 Method of test

##### 9.2.1HC.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: normal; see clauses G.2.1 and G.2.2.

Frequencies to be tested: mid range; see clause G.2.4.

1\) Connect the SS (node B emulator) and fader and AWGN noise source to
the UE antenna connector as shown in figure A.46.

2\) Set up an HSDPA call according to TS 34.108 \[3\] clause 7.3.16 and
with levels according to Table E.5.0.

3\) Set the node B emulator behaviour according to table 9.2.4. Set the
test parameters for test 1 according to table 9.2.1HC.1 and levels
according to tables 9.2.1HC.3 and 9.2.1HC.4 as appropriate on serving
HS-DSCH cell and secondary serving HS-DSCH cells. The configuration of
the downlink channels is defined in table E.5.1A and is to be applied to
serving HS-DSCH cell. For secondary serving HS-DSCH cells set up
P-CPICH, HS-PDSCH and HS-SCCH channels only per table E.5.1A.

4\) The information bit data shall be pseudo random and not repeated
before 10 different information bit payload blocks are processed. (e.g.
Fixed reference Channel Definition H-set 8 (64 QAM): The information bit
payload block is 26600 bits long. Hence the PRBSequence must be at least
26600 \* 10 bits long.) Use a PRBS from ITU-T O.153 Ref \[27\].

5\) The SS shall not time the transmission freely. It shall time the
transmission strictly according to the reference measurement channels:
i.e. Process number is continued exactly after 6 TTIs.

6\) Setup the fading simulator with fading conditions as described in
table D.2.2.1.A.

##### 9.2.1HC.4.2 Procedure

1\) Once the HSDPA connection is setup, change levels according to
Tables E.5.6 to E.5.8B as specified by table E.5.9 and start
transmitting HSDPA Data on serving cell and on all secondary serving
cells. For secondary serving HS-DSCH cells only P-CPICH, HS-PDSCH and
HS-SCCH are configured.

2\) For all relevant propagation conditions, for all relevant Ioc
levels, for all relevant Ec/Ior, for all relevant Îor/Ioc, for all
relevant H-sets in tables 9.2.1HC.3 and 9.2.1HC.4 count the number of
NACK, ACK and statDTX on the UL HS-DPCCH during the test interval on
both the cells and decide pass or fail according to Annex F.6.3 table
F.6.3.5.2.7 Throughput shall be measured per cell and compared to
requirements in table F.6.3.5.2.7.

##### 9.2.1HC.5 Test Requirements

Tables 9.2.1HC.3 and 9.2.1HC.4 define the primary level settings
including test tolerance for all relevant throughput tests to be applied
to the serving and secondary serving cells. The pass / fail decision for
throughput is done according to Annex F.6.3.

Tables E.5.6 to E.5.8B define the secondary and subsequently ranked
level settings including test tolerance to be applied to serving cell
and secondary serving cells. As those level settings are not uniform for
the throughput tests in this clause, Table E.5.9 indicates which levels
are applied, when the primary level settings (Ec/Ior and Ior/Ioc) and
propagation conditions (PA3) vary.

### 9.2.1HD Single Link Performance - Enhanced Performance Requirements Type 2 - 64QAM, Fixed Reference Channel (FRC) H-Set 8C 

#### 9.2.1HD.1 Definition and applicability

The receiver single link performance of the High Speed Physical Downlink
Shared Channel (HS-DSCH) in different multi-path fading environments are
determined by the information bit throughput R.

The requirements and this test apply for Release 10 and later releases
to all types of UTRA for the FDD UE that support 4C-HSDPA and HSDPA UE
capability category 31 but not the optional enhanced performance
requirements Type 3 or Type 3i.

#### 9.2.1HD.2 Minimum requirements

The performance requirements for a particular UE belonging to HS-DSCH
category 31 are determined according to the relevant part of Table
9.2.3F.

During the Fixed Reference Channel (FRC) tests the behaviour of the
Node-B emulator in response to the ACK/NACK signalling field of the
HS-DPCCH is specified in Table 9.2.4.

The requirements are specified in terms of minimum information bit
throughput R for the DL reference channels H-Set 8C specified in Annex
C.8.1.8, with the addition of the relevant parameters in Table 9.2.1HD.1
plus the downlink physical channel setup according to table E.5.1A.

Using this configuration the throughput shall meet or exceed the minimum
requirements specified in tables 9.2.1HD.2.

The reference for this requirement is TS 25.101 \[1\] clause 9.2.1.6.

#### 9.2.1HD.3 Test purpose

To verify the ability of the receiver to receive a predefined test
signal, representing a multi-path fading channel with information bit
throughput R not falling below a specified value. The test stresses the
multicode reception and channel decoding with incremental redundancy.

#### 9.2.1HD.4 Method of test

##### 9.2.1HD.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: normal; see clauses G.2.1 and G.2.2.

Frequencies to be tested: mid range; see clause G.2.4.

1\) Connect the SS (node B emulator) and fader and AWGN noise source to
the UE antenna connector as shown in figure A.46.

2\) Set up an HSDPA call according to TS 34.108 \[3\] clause 7.3.16 and
with levels according to table E.5.0.

3\) Set the node B emulator behaviour according to table 9.2.4. Set the
test parameters for test 1 according to table 9.2.1HD.1 and levels
according to tables 9.2.1HD.3 and 9.2.1HD.4 as appropriate on serving
HS-DSCH cell and secondary serving HS-DSCH cells. The configuration of
the downlink channels is defined in table E.5.1A and is to be applied to
serving HS-DSCH cell. For secondary serving HS-DSCH cells set up
P-CPICH, HS-PDSCH and HS-SCCH channels only per table E.5.1A.

4\) The information bit data shall be pseudo random and not repeated
before 10 different information bit payload blocks are processed. (e.g.
Fixed reference Channel Definition H-set 8 (64 QAM): The information bit
payload block is 26600 bits long. Hence the PRBSequence must be at least
26600 \* 10 bits long.) Use a PRBS from ITU-T O.153 Ref \[27\].

5\) The SS shall not time the transmission freely. It shall time the
transmission strictly according to the reference measurement channels:
i.e. Process number is continued exactly after 6 TTIs.

6\) Setup the fading simulator with fading conditions as described in
table D.2.2.1.A.

##### 9.2.1HD.4.2 Procedure

1\) Once the HSDPA connection is setup, change levels according to
Tables E.5.6 to E.5.8B as specified by table E.5.9 and start
transmitting HSDPA Data on both serving cells For secondary serving
HS-DSCH cells only P-CPICH, HS-PDSCH and HS-SCCH are configured.

2\) For all relevant propagation conditions, for all relevant Ioc
levels, for all relevant Ec/Ior, for all relevant Îor/Ioc, for all
relevant H-sets in tables 9.2.1HD.3 and 9.2.1HD.4 count the number of
NACK, ACK and statDTX on the UL HS-DPCCH during the test interval on
both the cells and decide pass or fail according to Annex F.6.3 table
F.6.3.5.2.7. Throughput shall be measured per cell and compared to
requirements in table F.6.3.5.2.7.

##### 9.2.1HD.5 Test Requirements

Tables 9.2.1HD.3 and 9.2.1HD.4 define the primary level settings
including test tolerance for all relevant throughput tests to be applied
to both serving cells. The pass / fail decision for throughput is done
according to Annex F.6.3.

Tables E.5.6 to E.5.8B define the secondary and subsequently ranked
level settings including test tolerance to be applied to serving and
secondary serving cells. As those level settings are not uniform for the
throughput tests in this clause, Table E.5.9 indicates which levels are
applied, when the primary level settings (Ec/Ior and Ior/Ioc) and
propagation conditions (PA3) vary.

### 9.2.1I Single Link Performance - Enhanced Performance Requirements Type 3 - 64QAM, Fixed Reference Channel (FRC) H-Set 8

#### 9.2.1I.1 Definition and applicability

The receiver single link performance of the High Speed Physical Downlink
Shared Channel (HS-DSCH) in different multi-path fading environments are
determined by the information bit throughput R.

The requirements and this test apply for Release 7 and later releases to
all types of UTRA for the FDD UE that support HSDPA UE capability
categories 13 or 14, and the optional enhanced performance requirements
type 3.

The requirements and this test apply also for Release 7 and later
releases to all types of UTRA for the FDD UE that support HSDPA UE
capability categories 17 or 18.

The requirements and this test apply for Release 8 and later releases to
all types of UTRA for the FDD UE that support HSDPA UE capability
categories 13 or 14, and the optional enhanced performance requirements
type 3i.

The requirements and this test apply also for Release 8 and later
releases to all types of UTRA for the FDD UE that support HSDPA UE
capability categories 19 - 20.

#### 9.2.1I.2 Minimum requirements

The performance requirements for a particular UE belonging to a certain
HS-DSCH category and supporting the optional enhanced performance
requirements type 3 are determined according to the relevant part of
Table 9.2.3A.

During the Fixed Reference Channel (FRC) tests the behaviour of the
Node-B emulator in response to the ACK/NACK signalling field of the

The reference for this requirement is TS 25.101 \[1\] clause 9.2.1.6.

#### 9.2.1I.3 Test purpose

To verify the ability of the receiver to receive a predefined test
signal, representing a multi-path fading channel with information bit
throughput R not falling below a specified value. The test stresses the
multicode reception and channel decoding with incremental redundancy.

#### 9.2.1I.4 Method of test

##### 9.2.1I.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: normal; see clauses G.2.1 and G.2.2.

Frequencies to be tested: mid range; see clause G.2.4.

1\) Connect the SS (node B emulator) and fader and AWGN noise source to
the UE antenna connector as shown in figure A.21 for UEs that support
receive diversity or figure A.10 for UEs that do not support receive
diversity.

2\) Set up an HSDPA call with looping back 12.2kbps RMC according to TS
34.108 \[3\] clause 7.3.6 with exceptions for information elements
listed in table 9.2.1I.2A and with levels according to table E.5.0.

3\) Set the node B emulator behaviour according to table 9.2.4. Set the
test parameters for test 1 according to table 9.2.1I.1 and levels
according to tables 9.2.1I.3 and 9.2.1I.14 as appropriate. The
configuration of the downlink channels is defined in table E.5.1A.

4\) The information bit data shall be pseudo random and not repeated
before 10 different information bit payload blocks are processed. (e.g.
Fixed reference Channel Definition H-set 8 (64QAM): The information bit
payload block is 26600 bits long. Hence the PRBSequence must be at least
26600 \* 10 bits long. ) Use a PRBS from ITU-T O.153 Ref \[27\]

5\) The SS shall not time the transmission freely. It shall time the
transmission strictly according to the reference measurement channels:
i.e. Process number is continued exactly after 6 TTIs.

6\) Setup the fading simulator with fading conditions as described in
table D.2.2.1.A and clause D.2.6.

##### 9.2.1I.4.2 Procedure

1\) Once the HSDPA connection is setup, change levels according to
Tables E.5.6 to E.5.8C as specified by table E.5.9 and start
transmitting HSDPA Data.

2\) For all relevant propagation conditions, for all relevant Ioc
levels, for all relevant Ec/Ior, for all relevant Îor/Ioc, for all
relevant H-sets in tables 9.2.1I.3 and 9.2.1I.4 count the number of
NACK, ACK and statDTX on the UL HS-DPCCH during the test interval and
decide pass or fail according to Annex F.6.3 table F.6.3.5.2.7A.

#### 9.2.1I.5 Test Requirements

Tables 9.2.1I.3 and 9.2.1I.4 define the primary level settings including
test tolerance for all relevant throughput tests. The pass / fail
decision for throughput is done according to Annex F.6.3.

Tables E.5.6 to E.5.8C define the secondary and subsequently ranked
level settings including test tolerance. As those level settings are not
uniform for the throughput tests in this clause, Table E.5.9 indicates
which levels are applied, when the primary level settings (Ec/Ior and
Ior/Ioc) and propagation conditions (PA3) vary.

### 9.2.1IA Single Link Performance - Enhanced Performance Requirements Type 3 - 64QAM, Fixed Reference Channel (FRC) H-Set 8A

#### 9.2.1IA.1 Definition and applicability

The receiver single link performance of the High Speed Physical Downlink
Shared Channel (HS-DSCH) in different multi-path fading environments are
determined by the information bit throughput R.

The requirements and this test apply for Release 8 and later releases to
all types of UTRA for the FDD UE that support: HSDPA UE capability
categories 23-24 and support the optional enhanced performance
requirements type 3 or 3i but not support DB-DC-HSDPA operation.

The requirements and this test apply for Release 9 and later releases to
all types of UTRA for the FDD UE that support: HSDPA UE capability
categories 27-28 and support the optional enhanced performance
requirements type 3 or 3i but not support DB-DC-HSDPA operation.

#### 9.2.1IA.2 Minimum requirements

The performance requirements for a particular UE belonging to a certain
HS-DSCH category and supporting the optional enhanced performance
requirements type 3 are determined according to the relevant part of
Table 9.2.3D.

During the Fixed Reference Channel (FRC) tests the behaviour of the
Node-B emulator in response to the ACK/NACK signalling field of the
HS-DPCCH is specified in Table 9.2.4.

The requirements are specified in terms of minimum information bit
throughput R for the DL reference channels H-set 8A specified in Annex
C.8.1.8, with the addition of the relevant parameters in Table 9.2.1IA.1
plus the downlink physical channel setup according to table E.5.1A.

Using this configuration the throughput shall meet or exceed the minimum
requirements specified in tables 9.2.1IA.2.

The reference for this requirement is TS 25.101 \[1\] clause 9.2.1.6.

#### 9.2.1IA.3 Test purpose

To verify the ability of the receiver to receive a predefined test
signal, representing a multi-path fading channel with information bit
throughput R not falling below a specified value. The test stresses the
multicode reception and channel decoding with incremental redundancy.

#### 9.2.1IA.4 Method of test

##### 9.2.1IA.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: normal; see clauses G.2.1 and G.2.2.

Frequencies to be tested: mid range; see clause G.2.4.

1\) Connect the SS (node B emulator) and fader and AWGN noise source to
the UE antenna connector as shown in figure A.37 for UEs that support
receive diversity or figure A.35 for UEs that do not support receive
diversity.

2\) Set up an HSDPA call according to TS 34.108 \[3\] clause 7.3.13 with
exceptions for information elements listed in table 9.2.1IA.2A and with
levels according to table E.5.0.

3\) Set the node B emulator behaviour according to table 9.2.4. Set the
test parameters for test 1 according to table 9.2.1IA.1 and levels
according to tables 9.2.1IA.3 and 9.2.1IA.14 as appropriate on both
serving HS-DSCH cell and secondary serving HS-DSCH cell. The
configuration of the downlink channels is defined in table E.5.1A and is
to be applied to serving HS-DSCH cell and for secondary serving HS-DSCH
cell set up P-CPICH, HS-PDSCH and HS-SCCH channels only per table
E.5.1A.

4\) The information bit data shall be pseudo random and not repeated
before 10 different information bit payload blocks are processed. (e.g.
Fixed reference Channel Definition H-set 8 (64QAM): The information bit
payload block is 26600 bits long. Hence the PRBSequence must be at least
26600 \* 10 bits long. ) Use a PRBS from ITU-T O.153 Ref \[27\]

5\) The SS shall not time the transmission freely. It shall time the
transmission strictly according to the reference measurement channels:
i.e. Process number is continued exactly after 6 TTIs.

6\) Setup the fading simulator with fading conditions as described in
table D.2.2.1.A and clause D.2.6.

##### 9.2.1IA.4.2 Procedure

1\) Once the HSDPA connection is setup, change levels according to
Tables E.5.6 to E.5.8B as specified by table E.5.9 and start
transmitting HSDPA Data on both serving cells for secondary serving
HS-DSCH cell only P-CPICH, HS-PDSCH and HS-SCCH are configured

2\) For all relevant propagation conditions, for all relevant Ioc
levels, for all relevant Ec/Ior, for all relevant Îor/Ioc, for all
relevant H-sets in tables 9.2.1IA.3 and 9.2.1IA.4 count the number of
NACK, ACK and statDTX on the UL HS-DPCCH during the test interval on
both the cells and decide pass or fail according to Annex F.6.3 table
F.6.3.5.2.7A. Throughput shall be measured per cell and compared to
requirements in table F.6.3.5.2.7A.

##### 9.2.1IA.5 Test Requirements

Tables 9.2.1IA.3 and 9.2.1IA.4 define the primary level settings
including test tolerance for all relevant throughput tests. The pass /
fail decision for throughput is done according to Annex F.6.3.

Tables E.5.6 to E.5.8B define the secondary and subsequently ranked
level settings including test tolerance to be applied on both serving
cells. As those level settings are not uniform for the throughput tests
in this clause, Table E.5.9 indicates which levels are applied, when the
primary level settings (Ec/Ior and Ior/Ioc) and propagation conditions
(PA3) vary.

### 9.2.1IB Single Link Performance - Enhanced Performance Requirements Type 3 - 64QAM, Fixed Reference Channel (FRC) H-Set 8A for DB-DC-HSDPA

#### 9.2.1IB.1 Definition and applicability

The receiver single link performance of the High Speed Physical Downlink
Shared Channel (HS-DSCH) in different multi-path fading environments are
determined by the information bit throughput R.

The requirements and this test apply for Release 9 and later releases to
all types of UTRA for the FDD UE that support: DB-DC-HSDPA and HSDPA UE
capability categories 23, 24, 27 or 28 and support the optional enhanced
performance requirements type 3 or 3i.

DB-DC-HSDPA is designed to operate in configurations specified in clause
4.2.

#### 9.2.1IB.2 Minimum requirements

The performance requirements for a particular UE belonging to a certain
HS-DSCH category and supporting the optional enhanced performance
requirements type 3 are determined according to the relevant part of
Table 9.2.3D.

During the Fixed Reference Channel (FRC) tests the behaviour of the
Node-B emulator in response to the ACK/NACK signalling field of the
HS-DPCCH is specified in Table 9.2.4.

The requirements are specified in terms of minimum information bit
throughput R for the DL reference channels H-set 8A specified in Annex
C.8.1.8, with the addition of the relevant parameters in Table 9.2.1IB.1
plus the downlink physical channel setup according to table E.5.1A.

Using this configuration the throughput shall meet or exceed the minimum
requirements specified in tables 9.2.1IB.2.

The reference for this requirement is TS 25.101 \[1\] clause 9.2.1.6.

#### 9.2.1IB.3 Test purpose

To verify the ability of the receiver to receive a predefined test
signal, representing a multi-path fading channel with information bit
throughput R not falling below a specified value. The test stresses the
multicode reception and channel decoding with incremental redundancy.

#### 9.2.1IB.4 Method of test

##### 9.2.1IB.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: normal; see clauses G.2.1 and G.2.2.

Frequencies to be tested: mid range; see clause G.2.4.

1\) Connect the SS (node B emulator) and fader and AWGN noise source to
the UE antenna connector as shown in figure A.37 for UEs that support
receive diversity or figure A.35 for UEs that do not support receive
diversity.

2\) Set up an HSDPA call according to TS 34.108 \[3\] clause 7.3.13 with
exceptions for information elements listed in table 9.2.1IB.2A and with
levels according to table E.5.0.

3\) Set the node B emulator behaviour according to table 9.2.4. Set the
test parameters for test 1 according to table 9.2.1IB.1 and levels
according to tables 9.2.1IB.3 and 9.2.1IB.4 as appropriate on both
serving HS-DSCH cell and secondary serving HS-DSCH cell. The primary and
secondary serving cells are set on different bands according to
DB-DC-HSDPA configurations defined in Section 4.2. The configuration of
the downlink channels is defined in table E.5.1A and is to be applied to
serving HS-DSCH cell and for secondary serving HS-DSCH cell set up
P-CPICH, HS-PDSCH and HS-SCCH channels only per table E.5.1A.

4\) The information bit data shall be pseudo random and not repeated
before 10 different information bit payload blocks are processed. (e.g.
Fixed reference Channel Definition H-set 8 (64QAM): The information bit
payload block is 26600 bits long. Hence the PRBSequence must be at least
26600 \* 10 bits long. ) Use a PRBS from ITU-T O.153 Ref \[27\]

5\) The SS shall not time the transmission freely. It shall time the
transmission strictly according to the reference measurement channels:
i.e. Process number is continued exactly after 6 TTIs.

6\) Setup the fading simulator with fading conditions as described in
table D.2.2.1.A and clause D.2.6.

##### 9.2.1IB.4.2 Procedure

1\) Once the HSDPA connection is setup, change levels according to
Tables E.5.6 to E.5.8B as specified by table E.5.9 and start
transmitting HSDPA Data on both serving cells for secondary serving
HS-DSCH cell only P-CPICH, HS-PDSCH and HS-SCCH are configured.

2\) For all relevant propagation conditions, for all relevant Ioc
levels, for all relevant Ec/Ior, for all relevant Îor/Ioc, for all
relevant H-sets in tables 9.2.1IB.3 and 9.2.1IB.4 count the number of
NACK, ACK and statDTX on the UL HS-DPCCH during the test interval on
both the cells and decide pass or fail according to Annex F.6.3 table
F.6.3.5.2.7A. Throughput shall be measured per cell and compared to
requirements in table F.6.3.5.2.7A.

##### 9.2.1IB.5 Test Requirements

Tables 9.2.1IB.3 and 9.2.1IB.4 define the primary level settings
including test tolerance for all relevant throughput tests. The pass /
fail decision for throughput is done according to Annex F.6.3.

Tables E.5.6 to E.5.8B define the secondary and subsequently ranked
level settings including test tolerance to be applied on both serving
cells. As those level settings are not uniform for the throughput tests
in this clause, Table E.5.9 indicates which levels are applied, when the
primary level settings (Ec/Ior and Ior/Ioc) and propagation conditions
(PA3) vary.

### 9.2.1IC Single Link Performance - Enhanced Performance Requirements Type 3 - 64QAM, Fixed Reference Channel (FRC) H-Set 8B

#### 9.2.1IC.1 Definition and applicability

The receiver single link performance of the High Speed Physical Downlink
Shared Channel (HS-DSCH) in different multi-path fading environments are
determined by the information bit throughput R.

The requirements and this test apply for Release 10 and later releases
to all types of UTRA for the FDD UE that support 4C-HSDPA and HSDPA UE
capability categories 29 or 30 and support the optional enhanced
performance requirements type 3 or 3i.

#### 9.2.1IC.2 Minimum requirements

The performance requirements for a particular UE belonging to a certain
HS-DSCH category and supporting the optional enhanced performance
requirements type 3 are determined according to the relevant part of
Table 9.2.3H.

During the Fixed Reference Channel (FRC) tests the behaviour of the
Node-B emulator in response to the ACK/NACK signalling field of the
HS-DPCCH is specified in Table 9.2.4.

The requirements are specified in terms of minimum information bit
throughput R for the DL reference channels H-set 8B specified in Annex
C.8.1.8, with the addition of the relevant parameters in Table 9.2.1IC.1
plus the downlink physical channel setup according to table E.5.1A.

Using this configuration the throughput shall meet or exceed the minimum
requirements specified in tables 9.2.1IC.2.

The reference for this requirement is TS 25.101 \[1\] clause 9.2.1.6.

#### 9.2.1IC.3 Test purpose

To verify the ability of the receiver to receive a predefined test
signal, representing a multi-path fading channel with information bit
throughput R not falling below a specified value. The test stresses the
multicode reception and channel decoding with incremental redundancy.

#### 9.2.1IC.4 Method of test

##### 9.2.1IC.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: normal; see clauses G.2.1 and G.2.2.

Frequencies to be tested: mid range; see clause G.2.4.

1\) Connect the SS (node B emulator) and fader and AWGN noise source to
the UE antenna connector as shown in figure A.47 for UEs that support
receive diversity or figure A.46 for UEs that do not support receive
diversity.

2\) Set up an HSDPA call according to TS 34.108 \[3\] clause 7.3.16 with
exceptions for information elements listed in table 9.2.1IC.2A and with
levels according to table E.5.0.

3\) Set the node B emulator behaviour according to table 9.2.4. Set the
test parameters for test 1 according to table 9.2.1IC.1 and levels
according to tables 9.2.1IC.3 and 9.2.1IC.4 as appropriate on both
serving HS-DSCH cell and secondary serving HS-DSCH cells. The
configuration of the downlink channels is defined in table E.5.1A and is
to be applied to serving HS-DSCH cell and for secondary serving HS-DSCH
cells set up P-CPICH, HS-PDSCH and HS-SCCH channels only per table
E.5.1A.

4\) The information bit data shall be pseudo random and not repeated
before 10 different information bit payload blocks are processed. (e.g.
Fixed reference Channel Definition H-set 8 (64QAM): The information bit
payload block is 26600 bits long. Hence the PRBSequence must be at least
26600 \* 10 bits long. ) Use a PRBS from ITU-T O.153 Ref \[27\]

5\) The SS shall not time the transmission freely. It shall time the
transmission strictly according to the reference measurement channels:
i.e. Process number is continued exactly after 6 TTIs.

6\) Setup the fading simulator with fading conditions on each cell as
described in table D.2.2.1.A and clause D.2.6.

##### 9.2.1IC.4.2 Procedure

1\) Once the HSDPA connection is setup, change levels according to
Tables E.5.6 to E.5.8B as specified by table E.5.9 and start
transmitting HSDPA Data on each cell.

2\) For all relevant propagation conditions, for all relevant Ioc
levels, for all relevant Ec/Ior, for all relevant Îor/Ioc, for all
relevant H-sets in tables 9.2.1IC.3 and 9.2.1IC.4 count the number of
NACK, ACK and statDTX on the UL HS-DPCCH during the test interval on
both the cells and decide pass or fail according to Annex F.6.3 table
F.6.3.5.2.7A. Throughput shall be measured per cell and compared to
requirements in table F.6.3.5.2.7A.

##### 9.2.1IC.5 Test Requirements

Tables 9.2.1IC.3 and 9.2.1IC.4 define the primary level settings
including test tolerance for all relevant throughput tests. The pass /
fail decision for throughput is done according to Annex F.6.3.

Tables E.5.6 to E.5.8B define the secondary and subsequently ranked
level settings including test tolerance to be applied on each cell. As
those level settings are not uniform for the throughput tests in this
clause, Table E.5.9 indicates which levels are applied, when the primary
level settings (Ec/Ior and Ior/Ioc) and propagation conditions (PA3)
vary.

### 9.2.1ID Single Link Performance - Enhanced Performance Requirements Type 3 - 64QAM, Fixed Reference Channel (FRC) H-Set 8C

#### 9.2.1ID.1 Definition and applicability

The receiver single link performance of the High Speed Physical Downlink
Shared Channel (HS-DSCH) in different multi-path fading environments are
determined by the information bit throughput R.

The requirements and this test apply for Release 10 and later releases
to all types of UTRA for the FDD UE that support 4C-HSDPA and HSDPA UE
capability categories 31 or 32 and support the optional enhanced
performance requirements type 3 or 3i.

#### 9.2.1ID.2 Minimum requirements

The performance requirements for a particular UE belonging to a certain
HS-DSCH category and supporting the optional enhanced performance
requirements type 3 are determined according to the relevant part of
Table 9.2.3H.

During the Fixed Reference Channel (FRC) tests the behaviour of the
Node-B emulator in response to the ACK/NACK signalling field of the
HS-DPCCH is specified in Table 9.2.4.

The requirements are specified in terms of minimum information bit
throughput R for the DL reference channels H-set 8C specified in Annex
C.8.1.8, with the addition of the relevant parameters in Table 9.2.1ID.1
plus the downlink physical channel setup according to table E.5.1A.

Using this configuration the throughput shall meet or exceed the minimum
requirements specified in tables 9.2.1ID.2.

The reference for this requirement is TS 25.101 \[1\] clause 9.2.1.6.

#### 9.2.1ID.3 Test purpose

To verify the ability of the receiver to receive a predefined test
signal, representing a multi-path fading channel with information bit
throughput R not falling below a specified value. The test stresses the
multicode reception and channel decoding with incremental redundancy.

#### 9.2.1ID.4 Method of test

##### 9.2.1ID.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: normal; see clauses G.2.1 and G.2.2.

Frequencies to be tested: mid range; see clause G.2.4.

1\) Connect the SS (node B emulator) and fader and AWGN noise source to
the UE antenna connector as shown in figure A.47 for UEs that support
receive diversity or figure A.46 for UEs that do not support receive
diversity.

2\) Set up an HSDPA call according to TS 34.108 \[3\] clause 7.3.16 with
exceptions for information elements listed in table 9.2.1ID.2A and with
levels according to table E.5.0.

3\) Set the node B emulator behaviour according to table 9.2.4. Set the
test parameters for test 1 according to table 9.2.1ID.1 and levels
according to tables 9.2.1ID.3 and 9.2.1ID.4 as appropriate on both
serving HS-DSCH cell and secondary serving HS-DSCH cells. The
configuration of the downlink channels is defined in table E.5.1A and is
to be applied to serving HS-DSCH cell and for secondary serving HS-DSCH
cells set up P-CPICH, HS-PDSCH and HS-SCCH channels only per table
E.5.1A.

4\) The information bit data shall be pseudo random and not repeated
before 10 different information bit payload blocks are processed. (e.g.
Fixed reference Channel Definition H-set 8 (64QAM): The information bit
payload block is 26600 bits long. Hence the PRBSequence must be at least
26600 \* 10 bits long. ) Use a PRBS from ITU-T O.153 Ref \[27\]

5\) The SS shall not time the transmission freely. It shall time the
transmission strictly according to the reference measurement channels:
i.e. Process number is continued exactly after 6 TTIs.

6\) Setup the fading simulator with fading conditions on each cell as
described in table D.2.2.1.A and clause D.2.6.

##### 9.2.1ID.4.2 Procedure

1\) Once the HSDPA connection is setup, change levels according to
Tables E.5.6 to E.5.8B as specified by table E.5.9 and start
transmitting HSDPA Data on each cell.

2\) For all relevant propagation conditions, for all relevant Ioc
levels, for all relevant Ec/Ior, for all relevant Îor/Ioc, for all
relevant H-sets in tables 9.2.1ID.3 and 9.2.1ID.4 count the number of
NACK, ACK and statDTX on the UL HS-DPCCH during the test interval on
both the cells and decide pass or fail according to Annex F.6.3 table
F.6.3.5.2.7A. Throughput shall be measured per cell and compared to
requirements in table F.6.3.5.2.7A.

##### 9.2.1ID.5 Test Requirements

Tables 9.2.1ID.3 and 9.2.1ID.4 define the primary level settings
including test tolerance for all relevant throughput tests. The pass /
fail decision for throughput is done according to Annex F.6.3.

Tables E.5.6 to E.5.8B define the secondary and subsequently ranked
level settings including test tolerance to be applied on each cell. As
those level settings are not uniform for the throughput tests in this
clause, Table E.5.9 indicates which levels are applied, when the primary
level settings (Ec/Ior and Ior/Ioc) and propagation conditions (PA3)
vary.

The reference for this requirement is TS 25.101 \[1\] clauses 9.2.1.7
and 9.2.1.8.

#### 9.2.1J.3 Test purpose

To verify the ability of the receiver to receive a predefined test
signal, representing a multi-path fading channel with information bit
throughput R not falling below a specified value. The test stresses the
multicode reception and channel decoding with incremental redundancy.

#### 9.2.1J.4 Method of test

##### 9.2.1J.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: normal; see clauses G.2.1 and G.2.2.

Frequencies to be tested: mid range; see clause G.2.4.

1\) Connect the SS (node B emulator) and fader and AWGN noise source to
the UE antenna connector as shown in figure A.21 for UEs that support
receive diversity or figure A.10 for UEs that do not support receive
diversity.

2\) Set up an HSDPA call with looping back 12.2kbps RMC according to TS
34.108 \[3\] clause 7.3.6 with exceptions for information elements
listed in table 9.2.1J.4A and with levels according to table E.5.0.

3\) Set the node B emulator behaviour according to table 9.2.4. Set the
test parameters for test 1 according to table 9.2.1J.1 or 9.2.1J.3 and
levels according to tables 9.2.1J.5 to 9.2.1J.8 as appropriate. The
configuration of the downlink channels is defined in table E.5.1A.

4\) The information bit data shall be pseudo random and not repeated
before 10 different information bit payload blocks are processed. (e.g.
Fixed reference Channel Definition H-set 10 (16 QAM): The information
bit payload block is 17548 bits long. Hence the PRBSequence must be at
least 17548 \* 10 bits long. ) Use a PRBS from ITU-T O.153 Ref \[27\]

5\) The SS shall not time the transmission freely. It shall time the
transmission strictly according to the reference measurement channels:
i.e. Process number is continued exactly after 6 TTIs.

6\) Setup the fading simulator with fading conditions as described in
table D.2.2.1C.

The reference for this requirement is TS 25.101 \[1\] clauses 9.2.1.7
and 9.2.1.8.

#### 9.2.1JA.3 Test purpose

To verify the ability of the receiver to receive a predefined test
signal, representing a multi-path fading channel with information bit
throughput R not falling below a specified value. The test stresses the
multicode reception and channel decoding with incremental redundancy.

#### 9.2.1JA.4 Method of test

##### 9.2.1JA.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: normal; see clauses G.2.1 and G.2.2.

Frequencies to be tested: mid range; see clause G.2.4.

1\) Connect the SS (node B emulator) and fader and AWGN noise source to
the UE antenna connector as shown in figure A.37 for UEs that support
receive diversity or figure A.35 for UEs that do not support receive
diversity.

2\) Set up an HSDPA call according to TS 34.108 \[3\] clause 7.3.13 with
exceptions for information elements listed in table 9.2.1JA.4A and with
levels according to table E.5.0.

3\) Set the node B emulator behaviour according to table 9.2.4. Set the
test parameters for test 1 according to table 9.2.1JA.1 or 9.2.1JA.3 and
levels according to tables 9.2.1JA.5 to 9.2.1JA.8 as appropriate to be
applied to both serving HS-DSCH cell and secondary serving HS-DSCH cell.
The configuration of the downlink channels is defined in table E.5.1A to
be applied on serving HS-DSCH cell and for secondary serving HS-DSCH
cell set up P-CPICH, HS-PDSCH and HS-SCCH channels only per table
E.5.1A.

4\) The information bit data shall be pseudo random and not repeated
before 10 different information bit payload blocks are processed. (e.g.
Fixed reference Channel Definition H-set 10 (16 QAM): The information
bit payload block is 17548 bits long. Hence the PRBSequence must be at
least 17548 \* 10 bits long. ) Use a PRBS from ITU-T O.153 Ref \[27\]

5\) The SS shall not time the transmission freely. It shall time the
transmission strictly according to the reference measurement channels:
i.e. Process number is continued exactly after 6 TTIs.

6\) Setup the fading simulator with fading conditions as described in
table D.2.2.1C.

##### 9.2.1JA.4.2 Procedure

1\) Once the HSDPA connection is setup, change levels according to Table
E.5.6 to E.5.8B as specified by table E.5.9 and start transmitting HSDPA
Data on both serving cells For secondary serving HS-DSCH cell only
P-CPICH, HS-PDSCH and HS-SCCH are configured

2\) For all relevant propagation conditions, for all relevant Ioc
levels, for all relevant Ec/Ior, for all relevant Îor/Ioc, for all
relevant H-sets in tables 9.2.1JA.5 to 9.2.1JA.8 count the number of
NACK, ACK and statDTX on the UL HS-DPCCH during the test interval on
both the cells and decide pass or fail according to Annex F.6.3 table
F.6.3.5.2.7B Throughput shall be measured per cell and compared to
requirements in table F.6.3.5.2.7B.

#### 9.2.1JA.5 Test Requirements

Tables 9.2.1JA.5 to 9.2.1JA.8 define the primary level settings
including test tolerance for all relevant throughput tests to be applied
to both serving cells. The pass / fail decision for throughput is done
according to Annex F.6.3.

Table E.5.6 to E.5.8B define the secondary and subsequently ranked level
settings including test tolerance and to be applied to both serving
cells.

### 9.2.1JB Single Link Performance - Enhanced Performance Requirements Type 2 - QPSK/16QAM, Fixed Reference Channel (FRC) H-Set 10A DB-DC-HSDPA

#### 9.2.1JB.1 Definition and applicability

The receiver single link performance of the High Speed Physical Downlink
Shared Channel (HS-DSCH) in different multi-path fading environments are
determined by the information bit throughput R.

The requirements and this test apply for Release 9 and later releases to
all types of UTRA for the FDD UE that support: DB-DC-HSDPA and HSDPA UE
capability categories 21 - 24 but not the optional enhanced performance
requirements Type 3 or Type 3i.

#### 9.2.1JB.2 Minimum requirements

The performance requirements for a particular UE belonging to a certain
HS-DSCH category are determined according to the relevant part of Table
9.2.3C.

During the Fixed Reference Channel (FRC) tests the behaviour of the
Node-B emulator in response to the ACK/NACK signalling field of the
HS-DPCCH is specified in Table 9.2.4.

The requirements are specified in terms of minimum information bit
throughput R for the DL reference channel H-set 10A specified in Annex
C.8.1.10, with the addition of the relevant parameters in Tables
9.2.1JB.1 and 9.2.1JB.3 plus the downlink physical channel setup
according to table E.5.1A.

Using this configuration the throughput shall meet or exceed the minimum
requirements specified in tables 9.2.1JB.2, and 9.2.1JB.4.

The reference for this requirement is TS 25.101 \[1\] clauses 9.2.1.7
and 9.2.1.8.

#### 9.2.1JB.3 Test purpose

To verify the ability of the receiver to receive a predefined test
signal, representing a multi-path fading channel with information bit
throughput R not falling below a specified value. The test stresses the
multicode reception and channel decoding with incremental redundancy.

#### 9.2.1JB.4 Method of test

##### 9.2.1JB.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: normal; see clauses G.2.1 and G.2.2.

Frequencies to be tested: mid range; see clause G.2.4.

1\) Connect the SS (node B emulator) and fader and AWGN noise source to
the UE antenna connector as shown in figure A.37 for UEs that support
receive diversity or figure A.35 for UEs that do not support receive
diversity.

2\) Set up an HSDPA call according to TS 34.108 \[3\] clause 7.3.13 with
exceptions for information elements listed in table 9.2.1JB.4A and with
levels according to table E.5.0.

3\) Set the node B emulator behaviour according to table 9.2.4. Set the
test parameters for test 1 according to table 9.2.1JB.1 or 9.2.1JB.3 and
levels according to tables 9.2.1JB.5 to 9.2.1JB.8 as appropriate to be
applied to both serving HS-DSCH cell and secondary serving HS-DSCH cell.
The Primary and secondary serving cells are set on different bands
according to DB-DC-HSDPA configurations defined in Section 4.2.The
configuration of the downlink channels is defined in table E.5.1A to be
applied on serving HS-DSCH cell and for secondary serving HS-DSCH cell
set up P-CPICH, HS-PDSCH and HS-SCCH channels only per table E.5.1A.

4\) The information bit data shall be pseudo random and not repeated
before 10 different information bit payload blocks are processed. (e.g.
Fixed reference Channel Definition H-set 10 (16 QAM): The information
bit payload block is 17548 bits long. Hence the PRBSequence must be at
least 17548 \* 10 bits long. ) Use a PRBS from ITU-T O.153 Ref \[27\]

5\) The SS shall not time the transmission freely. It shall time the
transmission strictly according to the reference measurement channels:
i.e. Process number is continued exactly after 6 TTIs.

6\) Setup the fading simulator with fading conditions as described in
table D.2.2.1C.

##### 9.2.1JB.4.2 Procedure

1\) Once the HSDPA connection is setup, change levels according to Table
E.5.6 to E.5.8B as specified by table E.5.9 and start transmitting HSDPA
Data on both serving cells For secondary serving HS-DSCH cell only
P-CPICH, HS-PDSCH and HS-SCCH are configured

2\) For all relevant propagation conditions, for all relevant Ioc
levels, for all relevant Ec/Ior, for all relevant Îor/Ioc, for all
relevant H-sets in tables 9.2.1JB.5 to 9.2.1JB.8 count the number of
NACK, ACK and statDTX on the UL HS-DPCCH during the test interval on
both the cells and decide pass or fail according to Annex F.6.3 table
F.6.3.5.2.7B Throughput shall be measured per cell and compared to
requirements in table F.6.3.5.2.7B.

#### 9.2.1JB.5 Test Requirements

Tables 9.2.1JB.5 to 9.2.1JB.8 define the primary level settings
including test tolerance for all relevant throughput tests to be applied
to both serving cells. The pass / fail decision for throughput is done
according to Annex F.6.3.

Table E.5.6 to E.5.8B define the secondary and subsequently ranked level
settings including test tolerance and to be applied to both serving
cells.

### 9.2.1JC Single Link Performance - Enhanced Performance Requirements Type 2 - QPSK/16QAM, Fixed Reference Channel (FRC) H-Set 10B

#### 9.2.1JC.1 Definition and applicability

The receiver single link performance of the High Speed Physical Downlink
Shared Channel (HS-DSCH) in different multi-path fading environments are
determined by the information bit throughput R.

The requirements and this test apply for Release 10 and later releases
to all types of UTRA for the FDD UE that support 4C-HSDPA and HSDPA UE
capability category 29 but not the optional enhanced performance
requirements Type 3 or Type 3i.

#### 9.2.1JC.2 Minimum requirements

The performance requirements for a particular UE belonging to a certain
HS-DSCH category are determined according to the relevant part of Table
9.2.3F.

During the Fixed Reference Channel (FRC) tests the behaviour of the
Node-B emulator in response to the ACK/NACK signalling field of the
HS-DPCCH is specified in Table 9.2.4.

The requirements are specified in terms of minimum information bit
throughput R for the DL reference channel H-set 10B specified in Annex
C.8.1.10, with the addition of the relevant parameters in Tables
9.2.1JC.1 and 9.2.1JC.3 plus the downlink physical channel setup
according to table E.5.1A.

Using this configuration the throughput shall meet or exceed the minimum
requirements specified in tables 9.2.1JC.2, and 9.2.1JC.4.

The reference for this requirement is TS 25.101 \[1\] clauses 9.2.1.7
and 9.2.1.8.

#### 9.2.1JC.3 Test purpose

To verify the ability of the receiver to receive a predefined test
signal, representing a multi-path fading channel with information bit
throughput R not falling below a specified value. The test stresses the
multicode reception and channel decoding with incremental redundancy.

#### 9.2.1JC.4 Method of test

##### 9.2.1JC.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: normal; see clauses G.2.1 and G.2.2.

Frequencies to be tested: mid range; see clause G.2.4.

1\) Connect the SS (node B emulator) and fader and AWGN noise source to
the UE antenna connector as shown in figure A.47 for UEs that support
receive diversity or figure A.46 for UEs that do not support receive
diversity.

2\) Set up an HSDPA call according to TS 34.108 \[3\] clause 7.3.16 with
exceptions for information elements listed in 9.2.1JC.4A and with levels
according to table E.5.0.

3\) Set the node B emulator behaviour according to table 9.2.4. Set the
test parameters for test 1 according to table 9.2.1JC.1 or 9.2.1JC.3 and
levels according to tables 9.2.1JC.5 to 9.2.1JC.8 as appropriate to be
applied to serving HS-DSCH cell and secondary serving HS-DSCH cells. The
configuration of the downlink channels is defined in table E.5.1A to be
applied on serving HS-DSCH cell and for secondary serving HS-DSCH cells
set up P-CPICH, HS-PDSCH and HS-SCCH channels only per table E.5.1A.

4\) The information bit data shall be pseudo random and not repeated
before 10 different information bit payload blocks are processed. (e.g.
Fixed reference Channel Definition H-set 10 (16 QAM): The information
bit payload block is 17548 bits long. Hence the PRBSequence must be at
least 17548 \* 10 bits long. ) Use a PRBS from ITU-T O.153 Ref \[27\]

5\) The SS shall not time the transmission freely. It shall time the
transmission strictly according to the reference measurement channels:
i.e. Process number is continued exactly after 6 TTIs.

6\) Setup the fading simulator with fading conditions as described in
table D.2.2.1C.

##### 9.2.1JC.4.2 Procedure

1\) Once the HSDPA connection is setup, change levels according to Table
E.5.6 to E.5.8B as specified by table E.5.9 and start transmitting HSDPA
Data on each cell.

2\) For all relevant propagation conditions, for all relevant Ioc
levels, for all relevant Ec/Ior, for all relevant Îor/Ioc, for all
relevant H-sets in tables 9.2.1JC.5 to 9.2.1JC.8 count the number of
NACK, ACK and statDTX on the UL HS-DPCCH during the test interval on
both the cells and decide pass or fail according to Annex F.6.3 table
F.6.3.5.2.7B Throughput shall be measured per cell and compared to
requirements in table F.6.3.5.2.7B.

#### 9.2.1JC.5 Test Requirements

Tables 9.2.1JC.5 to 9.2.1JC.8 define the primary level settings
including test tolerance for all relevant throughput tests to be applied
to both serving cells. The pass / fail decision for throughput is done
according to Annex F.6.3.

Table E.5.6 to E.5.8B define the secondary and subsequently ranked level
settings including test tolerance and to be applied to both serving
cells.

### 9.2.1JD Single Link Performance - Enhanced Performance Requirements Type 2 - QPSK/16QAM, Fixed Reference Channel (FRC) H-Set 10C

#### 9.2.1JD.1 Definition and applicability

The receiver single link performance of the High Speed Physical Downlink
Shared Channel (HS-DSCH) in different multi-path fading environments are
determined by the information bit throughput R.

The requirements and this test apply for Release 10 and later releases
to all types of UTRA for the FDD UE that support 4C-HSDPA and HSDPA UE
capability category 31 but not the optional enhanced performance
requirements Type 3 or Type 3i.

#### 9.2.1JD.2 Minimum requirements

The performance requirements for a particular UE belonging to a certain
HS-DSCH category are determined according to the relevant part of Table
9.2.3F.

During the Fixed Reference Channel (FRC) tests the behaviour of the
Node-B emulator in response to the ACK/NACK signalling field of the
HS-DPCCH is specified in Table 9.2.4.

The requirements are specified in terms of minimum information bit
throughput R for the DL reference channel H-set 10C specified in Annex
C.8.1.10, with the addition of the relevant parameters in Tables
9.2.1JD.1 and 9.2.1JD.3 plus the downlink physical channel setup
according to table E.5.1A.

Using this configuration the throughput shall meet or exceed the minimum
requirements specified in tables 9.2.1JD.2, and 9.2.1JD.4.

The reference for this requirement is TS 25.101 \[1\] clauses 9.2.1.7
and 9.2.1.8.

#### 9.2.1JD.3 Test purpose

To verify the ability of the receiver to receive a predefined test
signal, representing a multi-path fading channel with information bit
throughput R not falling below a specified value. The test stresses the
multicode reception and channel decoding with incremental redundancy.

#### 9.2.1JD.4 Method of test

##### 9.2.1JD.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: normal; see clauses G.2.1 and G.2.2.

Frequencies to be tested: mid range; see clause G.2.4.

1\) Connect the SS (node B emulator) and fader and AWGN noise source to
the UE antenna connector as shown in figure A.47 for UEs that support
receive diversity or figure A.46 for UEs that do not support receive
diversity.

2\) Set up an HSDPA call according to TS 34.108 \[3\] clause 7.3.16 with
exceptions for information elements listed in 9.2.1JD.4A and with levels
according to table E.5.0.

3\) Set the node B emulator behaviour according to table 9.2.4. Set the
test parameters for test 1 according to table 9.2.1JD.1 or 9.2.1JD.3 and
levels according to tables 9.2.1JD.5 to 9.2.1JD.8 as appropriate to be
applied to serving HS-DSCH cell and secondary serving HS-DSCH cells. The
configuration of the downlink channels is defined in table E.5.1A to be
applied on serving HS-DSCH cell and for secondary serving HS-DSCH cells
set up P-CPICH, HS-PDSCH and HS-SCCH channels only per table E.5.1A.

4\) The information bit data shall be pseudo random and not repeated
before 10 different information bit payload blocks are processed. (e.g.
Fixed reference Channel Definition H-set 10 (16 QAM): The information
bit payload block is 17548 bits long. Hence the PRBSequence must be at
least 17548 \* 10 bits long. ) Use a PRBS from ITU-T O.153 Ref \[27\]

5\) The SS shall not time the transmission freely. It shall time the
transmission strictly according to the reference measurement channels:
i.e. Process number is continued exactly after 6 TTIs.

6\) Setup the fading simulator with fading conditions as described in
table D.2.2.1C.

##### 9.2.1JD.4.2 Procedure

1\) Once the HSDPA connection is setup, change levels according to Table
E.5.6 to E.5.8B as specified by table E.5.9 and start transmitting HSDPA
Data on each cell.

2\) For all relevant propagation conditions, for all relevant Ioc
levels, for all relevant Ec/Ior, for all relevant Îor/Ioc, for all
relevant H-sets in tables 9.2.1JD.5 to 9.2.1JD.8 count the number of
NACK, ACK and statDTX on the UL HS-DPCCH during the test interval on
both the cells and decide pass or fail according to Annex F.6.3 table
F.6.3.5.2.7B Throughput shall be measured per cell and compared to
requirements in table F.6.3.5.2.7B.

#### 9.2.1JD.5 Test Requirements

Tables 9.2.1JD.5 to 9.2.1JD.8 define the primary level settings
including test tolerance for all relevant throughput tests to be applied
to both serving cells. The pass / fail decision for throughput is done
according to Annex F.6.3.

Table E.5.6 to E.5.8B define the secondary and subsequently ranked level
settings including test tolerance and to be applied to both serving
cells.

### 9.2.1K Single Link Performance - Enhanced Performance Requirements Type 3 - QPSK/16QAM, Fixed Reference Channel (FRC) H-Set 10

#### 9.2.1K.1 Definition and applicability

The receiver single link performance of the High Speed Physical Downlink
Shared Channel (HS-DSCH) in different multi-path fading environments are
determined by the information bit throughput R.

The requirements and this test apply for Release 8 and later releases to
all types of UTRA for the FDD UE that support: HSDPA UE capability
categories 9, 10 and 13 to 14, and either the optional enhanced
performance requirements type 3 or the optional enhanced performance
requirements type 3i.

The requirements and this test apply for Release 8 and later releases to
all types of UTRA for the FDD UE that support: HSDPA UE capability
categories 15 to 18.

The requirements and this test apply also for Release 8 and later
releases to all types of UTRA for the FDD UE that support HSDPA UE
capability categories 19 - 20.

#### 9.2.1K.2 Minimum requirements

The performance requirements for a particular UE belonging to certain
HS-DSCH category are determined according to the relevant part of Table
9.2.3A.

During the Fixed Reference Channel (FRC) tests the behaviour of the
Node-B emulator in response to the ACK/NACK signalling field of the
HS-DPCCH is specified in Table 9.2.4.

The requirements are specified in terms of minimum information bit
throughput R for the DL reference channel H-set 10 specified in Annex
C.8.1.10, with the addition of the relevant parameters in Tables
9.2.1K.1 and 9.2.1K.3 plus the downlink physical channel setup according
to table E.5.1A.

Using this configuration the throughput shall meet or exceed the minimum
requirements specified in tables 9.2.1K.2, and 9.2.1K.4.

The reference for this requirement is TS 25.101 \[1\] clauses 9.2.1.7
and 9.2.1.8.

#### 9.2.1K.3 Test purpose

To verify the ability of the receiver to receive a predefined test
signal, representing a multi-path fading channel with information bit
throughput R not falling below a specified value. The test stresses the
multicode reception and channel decoding with incremental redundancy.

#### 9.2.1K.4 Method of test

##### 9.2.1K.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: normal; see clauses G.2.1 and G.2.2.

Frequencies to be tested: mid range; see clause G.2.4.

1\) Connect the SS (node B emulator) and fader and AWGN noise source to
the UE antenna connector as shown in figure A.21 for UEs that support
receive diversity or figure A.10 for UEs that do not support receive
diversity.

2\) Set up an HSDPA call with looping back 12.2kbps RMC according to TS
34.108 \[3\] clause 7.3.6 with exceptions for information elements
listed in table 9.2.1K.4A and with levels according to table E.5.0.

3\) Set the node B emulator behaviour according to table 9.2.4. Set the
test parameters for test 1 according to table 9.2.1K.1 or 9.2.1K.3 and
levels according to tables 9.2.1K.5 to 9.2.1K.8 as appropriate. The
configuration of the downlink channels is defined in table E.5.1A.

4\) The information bit data shall be pseudo random and not repeated
before 10 different information bit payload blocks are processed. (e.g.
Fixed reference Channel Definition H-set 10 (16 QAM): The information
bit payload block is 17548 bits long. Hence the PRBSequence must be at
least 17548 \* 10 bits long. ) Use a PRBS from ITU-T O.153 Ref \[27\]

5\) The SS shall not time the transmission freely. It shall time the
transmission strictly according to the reference measurement channels:
i.e. Process number is continued exactly after 6 TTIs.

6\) Setup the fading simulator with fading conditions as described in
table D.2.2.1C.

### 9.2.1KA Single Link Performance - Enhanced Performance Requirements Type 3 - QPSK/16QAM, Fixed Reference Channel (FRC) H-Set 10A

#### 9.2.1KA.1 Definition and applicability

The receiver single link performance of the High Speed Physical Downlink
Shared Channel (HS-DSCH) in different multi-path fading environments are
determined by the information bit throughput R.

The requirements and this test apply for Release 8 and later releases to
all types of UTRA for the FDD UE that support: HSDPA UE capability
categories 21-24 and support the optional enhanced performance
requirements type 3 or 3i but not support DB-DC-HSDPA operation.

The requirements and this test apply for Release 9 and later releases to
all types of UTRA for the FDD UE that support: HSDPA UE capability
categories 25-28 and support the optional enhanced performance
requirements type 3 or 3i but not support DB-DC-HSDPA operation.

#### 9.2.1KA.2 Minimum requirements

The performance requirements for a particular UE belonging to certain
HS-DSCH category are determined according to the relevant part of Table
9.2.3D.

During the Fixed Reference Channel (FRC) tests the behaviour of the
Node-B emulator in response to the ACK/NACK signalling field of the
HS-DPCCH is specified in Table 9.2.4.

The requirements are specified in terms of minimum information bit
throughput R for the DL reference channel H-set 10A specified in Annex
C.8.1.10, with the addition of the relevant parameters in Tables
9.2.1KA.1 and 9.2.1KA.3 plus the downlink physical channel setup
according to table E.5.1A.

Using this configuration the throughput shall meet or exceed the minimum
requirements specified in tables 9.2.1KA.2, and 9.2.1KA.4.

The reference for this requirement is TS 25.101 \[1\] clauses 9.2.1.7
and 9.2.1.8.

#### 9.2.1KA.3 Test purpose

To verify the ability of the receiver to receive a predefined test
signal, representing a multi-path fading channel with information bit
throughput R not falling below a specified value. The test stresses the
multicode reception and channel decoding with incremental redundancy.

#### 9.2.1KA.4 Method of test

##### 9.2.1KA.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: normal; see clauses G.2.1 and G.2.2.

Frequencies to be tested: mid range; see clause G.2.4.

1\) Connect the SS (node B emulator) and fader and AWGN noise source to
the UE antenna connector as shown in figure A.37 for UEs that support
receive diversity or figure A.35 for UEs that do not support receive
diversity.

2\) Set up an HSDPA call according to TS 34.108 \[3\] clause 7.3.13 with
exceptions for information elements listed in table 9.2.1KA.4A and with
levels according to table E.5.0.

3\) Set the node B emulator behaviour according to table 9.2.4. Set the
test parameters for test 1 according to table 9.2.1KA.1 or 9.2.1KA.3 and
levels according to tables 9.2.1KA.5 to 9.2.1KA.8 as appropriate on both
serving HS-DSCH cell and secondary HS-DSCH cell. The configuration of
the downlink channels is defined in table E.5.1A and is to be applied to
serving HS-DSCH cell and for secondary serving HS-DSCH cell set up
P-CPICH, HS-PDSCH and HS-SCCH channels only per table E.5.1A.

4\) The information bit data shall be pseudo random and not repeated
before 10 different information bit payload blocks are processed. (e.g.
Fixed reference Channel Definition H-set 10 (16 QAM): The information
bit payload block is 17548 bits long. Hence the PRBSequence must be at
least 17548 \* 10 bits long. ) Use a PRBS from ITU-T O.153 Ref \[27\]

5\) The SS shall not time the transmission freely. It shall time the
transmission strictly according to the reference measurement channels:
i.e. Process number is continued exactly after 6 TTIs.

6\) Setup the fading simulator with fading conditions as described in
table D.2.2.1C.

##### 9.2.1KA.4.2 Procedure

1\) Once the HSDPA connection is setup, change levels according to Table
E.5.8C and start transmitting HSDPA Data on both the serving cells For
secondary serving HS-DSCH cell only P-CPICH, HS-PDSCH and HS-SCCH are
configured.

2\) For all relevant propagation conditions, for all relevant Ioc
levels, for all relevant Ec/Ior, for all relevant Îor/Ioc, for all
relevant H-sets in tables 9.2.1KA.5 to 9.2.1KA.8 count the number of
NACK, ACK and statDTX on the UL HS-DPCCH during the test interval on
both the cells and decide pass or fail according to Annex F.6.3 table
F.6.3.5.2.7C. Throughput shall be measured per cell and compared to
requirements in table F.6.3.5.2.7C.

#### 9.2.1KA.5 Test Requirements

Tables 9.2.1KA.5 to 9.2.1KA.8 define the primary level settings
including test tolerance for all relevant throughput tests to be applied
to both the serving cells. The pass / fail decision for throughput is
done according to Annex F.6.3.

Table E.5.6 to E.5.8C defines the secondary and subsequently ranked
level settings including test tolerance to be applied to both the
serving cells.

### 9.2.1KB Single Link Performance - Enhanced Performance Requirements Type 3 - QPSK/16QAM, Fixed Reference Channel (FRC) H-Set 10A for DB-DC-HSDPA

#### 9.2.1KB.1 Definition and applicability

The receiver single link performance of the High Speed Physical Downlink
Shared Channel (HS-DSCH) in different multi-path fading environments are
determined by the information bit throughput R.

The requirements and this test apply for Release 9 and later releases to
all types of UTRA for the FDD UE that support: DB-DC-HSDPA and HSDPA UE
capability categories 21-28 and support the optional enhanced
performance requirements type 3 or 3i.

DB-DC-HSDPA is designed to operate in configurations specified in clause
4.2.

#### 9.2.1KB.2 Minimum requirements

The performance requirements for a particular UE belonging to certain
HS-DSCH category are determined according to the relevant part of Table
9.2.3D.

During the Fixed Reference Channel (FRC) tests the behaviour of the
Node-B emulator in response to the ACK/NACK signalling field of the
HS-DPCCH is specified in Table 9.2.4.

The requirements are specified in terms of minimum information bit
throughput R for the DL reference channel H-set 10A specified in Annex
C.8.1.10, with the addition of the relevant parameters in Tables
9.2.1KB.1 and 9.2.1KB.3 plus the downlink physical channel setup
according to table E.5.1A.

Using this configuration the throughput shall meet or exceed the minimum
requirements specified in tables 9.2.1KB.2, and 9.2.1KB.4.

The reference for this requirement is TS 25.101 \[1\] clauses 9.2.1.7
and 9.2.1.8.

#### 9.2.1KB.3 Test purpose

To verify the ability of the receiver to receive a predefined test
signal, representing a multi-path fading channel with information bit
throughput R not falling below a specified value. The test stresses the
multicode reception and channel decoding with incremental redundancy.

#### 9.2.1KB.4 Method of test

##### 9.2.1KB.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: normal; see clauses G.2.1 and G.2.2.

Frequencies to be tested: mid range; see clause G.2.4.

1\) Connect the SS (node B emulator) and fader and AWGN noise source to
the UE antenna connector as shown in figure A.37 for UEs that support
receive diversity or figure A.35 for UEs that do not support receive
diversity.

2\) Set up an HSDPA call according to TS 34.108 \[3\] clause 7.3.13 with
exceptions for information elements listed in table 9.2.1KB.4A and with
levels according to table E.5.0.

3\) Set the node B emulator behaviour according to table 9.2.4. Set the
test parameters for test 1 according to table 9.2.1KB.1 or 9.2.1KB.3 and
levels according to tables 9.2.1KB.5 to 9.2.1KB.8 as appropriate on both
serving HS-DSCH cell and secondary HS-DSCH cell. The Primary and
secondary serving cells are set on different bands according to
DB-DC-HSDPA configurations defined in Section 4.2. The configuration of
the downlink channels is defined in table E.5.1A and is to be applied to
serving HS-DSCH cell and for secondary serving HS-DSCH cell set up
P-CPICH, HS-PDSCH and HS-SCCH channels only per table E.5.1A.

4\) The information bit data shall be pseudo random and not repeated
before 10 different information bit payload blocks are processed. (e.g.
Fixed reference Channel Definition H-set 10 (16 QAM): The information
bit payload block is 17548 bits long. Hence the PRBSequence must be at
least 17548 \* 10 bits long. ) Use a PRBS from ITU-T O.153 Ref \[27\]

5\) The SS shall not time the transmission freely. It shall time the
transmission strictly according to the reference measurement channels:
i.e. Process number is continued exactly after 6 TTIs.

6\) Setup the fading simulator with fading conditions as described in
table D.2.2.1C.

##### 9.2.1KB.4.2 Procedure

1\) Once the HSDPA connection is setup, change levels according to Table
E.5.8C and start transmitting HSDPA Data on both the serving cells For
secondary serving HS-DSCH cell only P-CPICH, HS-PDSCH and HS-SCCH are
configured.

2\) For all relevant propagation conditions, for all relevant Ioc
levels, for all relevant Ec/Ior, for all relevant Îor/Ioc, for all
relevant H-sets in tables 9.2.1KB.5 to 9.2.1KB.8 count the number of
NACK, ACK and statDTX on the UL HS-DPCCH during the test interval on
both the cells and decide pass or fail according to Annex F.6.3 table
F.6.3.5.2.7C. Throughput shall be measured per cell and compared to
requirements in table F.6.3.5.2.7C.

#### 9.2.1KB.5 Test Requirements

Tables 9.2.1KB.5 to 9.2.1KB.8 define the primary level settings
including test tolerance for all relevant throughput tests to be applied
to both the serving cells. The pass / fail decision for throughput is
done according to Annex F.6.3.

Table E.5.6 to E.5.8C defines the secondary and subsequently ranked
level settings including test tolerance to be applied to both the
serving cells.

### 9.2.1KC Single Link Performance - Enhanced Performance Requirements Type 3 - QPSK/16QAM, Fixed Reference Channel (FRC) H-Set 10B

#### 9.2.1KC.1 Definition and applicability

The receiver single link performance of the High Speed Physical Downlink
Shared Channel (HS-DSCH) in different multi-path fading environments are
determined by the information bit throughput R.

The requirements and this test apply for Release 10 and later releases
to all types of UTRA for the FDD UE that support 4C-HSDPA and HSDPA UE
capability categories 29 or 30 and support the optional enhanced
performance requirements type 3 or 3i.

#### 9.2.1KC.2 Minimum requirements

The performance requirements for a particular UE belonging to a certain
HS-DSCH category and supporting the optional enhanced performance
requirements type 3 are determined according to the relevant part of
Table 9.2.3H.

During the Fixed Reference Channel (FRC) tests the behaviour of the
Node-B emulator in response to the ACK/NACK signalling field of the
HS-DPCCH is specified in Table 9.2.4.

The requirements are specified in terms of minimum information bit
throughput R for the DL reference channel H-set 10B specified in Annex
C.8.1.10, with the addition of the relevant parameters in Tables
9.2.1KC.1 and 9.2.1KC.3 plus the downlink physical channel setup
according to table E.5.1A.

Using this configuration the throughput shall meet or exceed the minimum
requirements specified in tables 9.2.1KC.2, and 9.2.1KC.4.

The reference for this requirement is TS 25.101 \[1\] clauses 9.2.1.7
and 9.2.1.8.

#### 9.2.1KC.3 Test purpose

To verify the ability of the receiver to receive a predefined test
signal, representing a multi-path fading channel with information bit
throughput R not falling below a specified value. The test stresses the
multicode reception and channel decoding with incremental redundancy.

#### 9.2.1KC.4 Method of test

##### 9.2.1KC.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: normal; see clauses G.2.1 and G.2.2.

Frequencies to be tested: mid range; see clause G.2.4.

1\) Connect the SS (node B emulator) and fader and AWGN noise source to
the UE antenna connector as shown in figure A.47 for UEs that support
receive diversity or figure A.46 for UEs that do not support receive
diversity.

2\) Set up an HSDPA call according to TS 34.108 \[3\] clause 7.3.16 with
exceptions for information elements listed in table 9.2.1KC.4A and with
levels according to table E.5.0.

3\) Set the node B emulator behaviour according to table 9.2.4. Set the
test parameters for test 1 according to table 9.2.1KC.1 or 9.2.1KC.3 and
levels according to tables 9.2.1KC.5 to 9.2.1KC.8 as appropriate on both
serving HS-DSCH cell and secondary HS-DSCH cells. The configuration of
the downlink channels is defined in table E.5.1A and is to be applied to
serving HS-DSCH cell and for secondary serving HS-DSCH cells set up
P-CPICH, HS-PDSCH and HS-SCCH channels only per table E.5.1A.

4\) The information bit data shall be pseudo random and not repeated
before 10 different information bit payload blocks are processed. (e.g.
Fixed reference Channel Definition H-set 10 (16 QAM): The information
bit payload block is 17548 bits long. Hence the PRBSequence must be at
least 17548 \* 10 bits long. ) Use a PRBS from ITU-T O.153 Ref \[27\]

5\) The SS shall not time the transmission freely. It shall time the
transmission strictly according to the reference measurement channels:
i.e. Process number is continued exactly after 6 TTIs.

6\) Setup the fading simulator with fading conditions as described in
table D.2.2.1C and clause D.2.6.

##### 9.2.1KC.4.2 Procedure

1\) Once the HSDPA connection is setup, change levels according to Table
E.5.8C and start transmitting HSDPA Data on each cell.

2\) For all relevant propagation conditions, for all relevant Ioc
levels, for all relevant Ec/Ior, for all relevant Îor/Ioc, for all
relevant H-sets in tables 9.2.1KC.5 to 9.2.1KC.8 count the number of
NACK, ACK and statDTX on the UL HS-DPCCH during the test interval on
both the cells and decide pass or fail according to Annex F.6.3 table
F.6.3.5.2.7C. Throughput shall be measured per cell and compared to
requirements in table F.6.3.5.2.7C.

#### 9.2.1KC.5 Test Requirements

Tables 9.2.1KC.5 to 9.2.1KC.8 define the primary level settings
including test tolerance for all relevant throughput tests to be applied
on each cell. The pass / fail decision for throughput is done according
to Annex F.6.3.

Table E.5.6 to E.5.8C defines the secondary and subsequently ranked
level settings including test tolerance to be applied on each cell.

### 9.2.1KD Single Link Performance - Enhanced Performance Requirements Type 3 - QPSK/16QAM, Fixed Reference Channel (FRC) H-Set 10C

#### 9.2.1KD.1 Definition and applicability

The receiver single link performance of the High Speed Physical Downlink
Shared Channel (HS-DSCH) in different multi-path fading environments are
determined by the information bit throughput R.

The requirements and this test apply for Release 10 and later releases
to all types of UTRA for the FDD UE that support 4C-HSDPA and HSDPA UE
capability categories 31 or 32 and support the optional enhanced
performance requirements type 3 or 3i.

#### 9.2.1KD.2 Minimum requirements

The performance requirements for a particular UE belonging to a certain
HS-DSCH category and supporting the optional enhanced performance
requirements type 3 are determined according to the relevant part of
Table 9.2.3H.

During the Fixed Reference Channel (FRC) tests the behaviour of the
Node-B emulator in response to the ACK/NACK signalling field of the
HS-DPCCH is specified in Table 9.2.4.

The requirements are specified in terms of minimum information bit
throughput R for the DL reference channel H-set 10C specified in Annex
C.8.1.10, with the addition of the relevant parameters in Tables
9.2.1KD.1 and 9.2.1KD.3 plus the downlink physical channel setup
according to table E.5.1A.

Using this configuration the throughput shall meet or exceed the minimum
requirements specified in tables 9.2.1KD.2, and 9.2.1KD.4.

The reference for this requirement is TS 25.101 \[1\] clauses 9.2.1.7
and 9.2.1.8.

#### 9.2.1KD.3 Test purpose

To verify the ability of the receiver to receive a predefined test
signal, representing a multi-path fading channel with information bit
throughput R not falling below a specified value. The test stresses the
multicode reception and channel decoding with incremental redundancy.

#### 9.2.1KD.4 Method of test

##### 9.2.1KD.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: normal; see clauses G.2.1 and G.2.2.

Frequencies to be tested: mid range; see clause G.2.4.

1\) Connect the SS (node B emulator) and fader and AWGN noise source to
the UE antenna connector as shown in figure A.47 for UEs that support
receive diversity or figure A.46 for UEs that do not support receive
diversity.

2\) Set up an HSDPA call according to TS 34.108 \[3\] clause 7.3.16 with
exceptions for information elements listed in table 9.2.1KD.4A and with
levels according to table E.5.0.

3\) Set the node B emulator behaviour according to table 9.2.4. Set the
test parameters for test 1 according to table 9.2.1KD.1 or 9.2.1KD.3 and
levels according to tables 9.2.1KD.5 to 9.2.1KD.8 as appropriate on both
serving HS-DSCH cell and secondary HS-DSCH cells. The configuration of
the downlink channels is defined in table E.5.1A and is to be applied to
serving HS-DSCH cell and for secondary serving HS-DSCH cells set up
P-CPICH, HS-PDSCH and HS-SCCH channels only per table E.5.1A.

4\) The information bit data shall be pseudo random and not repeated
before 10 different information bit payload blocks are processed. (e.g.
Fixed reference Channel Definition H-set 10 (16 QAM): The information
bit payload block is 17548 bits long. Hence the PRBSequence must be at
least 17548 \* 10 bits long. ) Use a PRBS from ITU-T O.153 Ref \[27\]

5\) The SS shall not time the transmission freely. It shall time the
transmission strictly according to the reference measurement channels:
i.e. Process number is continued exactly after 6 TTIs.

6\) Setup the fading simulator with fading conditions as described in
table D.2.2.1C and clause D.2.6.

##### 9.2.1KD.4.2 Procedure

1\) Once the HSDPA connection is setup, change levels according to Table
E.5.8C and start transmitting HSDPA Data on each cell.

2\) For all relevant propagation conditions, for all relevant Ioc
levels, for all relevant Ec/Ior, for all relevant Îor/Ioc, for all
relevant H-sets in tables 9.2.1KD.5 to 9.2.1KD.8 count the number of
NACK, ACK and statDTX on the UL HS-DPCCH during the test interval on
both the cells and decide pass or fail according to Annex F.6.3 table
F.6.3.5.2.7C. Throughput shall be measured per cell and compared to
requirements in table F.6.3.5.2.7C.

#### 9.2.1KD.5 Test Requirements

Tables 9.2.1KD.5 to 9.2.1KD.8 define the primary level settings
including test tolerance for all relevant throughput tests to be applied

### 9.2.1L Single Link Performance - Enhanced Performance Requirements Type 3i - QPSK, Fixed Reference Channel (FRC) H-Set 6

#### 9.2.1L.1 Definition and applicability

The receiver single link performance of the High Speed Physical Downlink
Shared Channel (HS-DSCH) in different multi-path fading environments are
determined by the information bit throughput R.

The requirements and this test apply for Release 8 and later releases to
all types of UTRA for the FDD UE that support: HSDPA UE capability
categories 7, 8, 9, 10 and 13 - 20, and the optional enhanced
performance requirements type 3i.

#### 9.2.1L.2 Minimum requirements

The performance requirements for a particular UE belonging to a certain
HS-DSCH category and supporting the optional enhanced performance
requirements type 3i are determined according to the relevant part of
Table 9.2.3B.

During the Fixed Reference Channel (FRC) tests the behaviour of the
Node-B emulator in response to the ACK/NACK signalling field of the
HS-DPCCH is specified in Table 9.2.4.

The requirements are specified in terms of a minimum information bit
throughput R for the DL reference channel H-Set 6 specified in Annex
C.8.1.6 with the addition of the relevant parameters in Table 9.2.1L.1
and the downlink physical channel setup according to table E.5.1.

Using this configuration the throughput shall meet or exceed the minimum
requirements specified in tables 9.2.1L.2.

listed in table 9.2.1L.2A and with levels according to table E.5.0.

3\) Set the node B emulator behaviour according to table 9.2.4. Set the
test parameters for test 1 according to table 9.2.1L.1 and levels
according to tables 9.2.1L.3 to 9.2.1L.4 as appropriate. The
configuration of the downlink channels is defined as per E.5E and table
E.5.1.

4\) The information bit data shall be pseudo random and not repeated
before 10 different information bit payload blocks are processed. (e.g.
Fixed reference Channel Definition H-set 6 (QPSK): The information bit
payload block is 6438 bits long. Hence the PRBSequence must be at least
6438 \* 10 bits long. ) Use a PRBS from ITU-T O.153 Ref \[27\]

5\) The SS shall not time the transmission freely. It shall time the
transmission strictly according to the reference measurement channels:
i.e. Process number is continued exactly after 6 TTIs.

6\) Setup the fading simulator with fading conditions as described in
table D.2.2.1A.

##### 9.2.1L.4.2 Procedure {#l.4.2-procedure .H6}

1\) Once the HSDPA connection is setup, change levels according to Table
E.5.6 to E.5.8B as specified by table E.5.9 and start transmitting HSDPA
Data.

2\) For all relevant propagation conditions, for all relevant Ioc
levels, for all relevant Ec/Ior, for all relevant Îor/Ioc, for all
relevant H-sets in tables 9.2.1L.3 to 9.2.1L.4 count the number of NACK,
ACK and statDTX on the UL HS-DPCCH during the test interval and decide
pass or fail according to Annex F.6.3 table F.6.3.5.2.7D

#### 9.2.1L.5 Test Requirements

Tables 9.2.1L.3 to 9.2.1L.4 define the primary level settings including
test tolerance for all relevant throughput tests. The pass / fail
decision for throughput is done according to Annex F.6.3.

Table E.5.6 to E.5.8B define the secondary and subsequently ranked level
settings including test tolerance. As those level settings are not
uniform for the throughput tests in this clause, Table E.5.9 indicates
which levels are applied, when the primary level settings (Ec/Ior and
Ior/Ioc) and propagation conditions (PB3, VA30) vary.

### 9.2.1LA Enhanced Performance Requirements Type 3i - QPSK, Fixed Reference Channel (FRC) H-Set 6A 

#### 9.2.1LA.1 Definition and applicability

The receiver single link performance of the High Speed Physical Downlink
Shared Channel (HS-DSCH) in different multi-path fading environments are
determined by the information bit throughput R.

The requirements and this test apply for Release 8 and later releases to
all types of UTRA for the FDD UE that support: DC-HSDPA UE capability
categories 21-24, and the optional enhanced performance requirements
type 3i.

The requirements and this test apply for Release 9 and later releases to
all types of UTRA for the FDD UE that support DC-HSDPA UE capability
categories 25-28 and the optional enhanced performance requirements type
3i.

#### 9.2.1LA.2 Minimum requirements

The performance requirements for a particular UE belonging to a certain
HS-DSCH category and supporting the optional enhanced performance
requirements type 3i are determined according to the relevant part of
Table 9.2.3E.

During the Fixed Reference Channel (FRC) tests the behaviour of the
Node-B emulator in response to the ACK/NACK signalling field of the
HS-DPCCH is specified in Table 9.2.4.

The requirements are specified in terms of a minimum information bit
throughput R for the DL reference channel H-Set 6A specified in Annex
C.8.1.6 with the addition of the relevant parameters in Table 9.2.1LA.1
and the downlink physical channel setup according to table E.5.1.

Using this configuration the throughput shall meet or exceed the minimum
requirements specified in tables 9.2.1LA.2.

+----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+

For DC-HSDPA, DB-DC-HSDPA or 4C-HSDPA tests which require more than 8
independent faders, the resulting propagation channel(s) shall be
generated by considering a number of independent faders needed for one
carrier and connecting them to the signal of randomly chosen carrier(s).
The maximum number of channel faders on the test will be less than or
equal to 8. The remaining carrier(s) shall be connected without a
channel fader but with AWGN. The throughput shall be collected only for
the carrier(s) connected to channel faders.

The test shall be repeated by choosing carrier(s) excluding already
chosen carrier(s) until all the carrier(s) are tested under fading
conditions. The sum of all the collected throughputs from each carrier
shall be compared against the reference value in the requirements.

All supported carriers shall be configured and activated during the
test.

The reference for this requirement is TS 25.101 \[1\] clauses 9.2.1.4
and C.5.4.

#### 9.2.1LA.3 Test purpose

To verify the ability of the receiver to receive a predefined test
signal, representing a multi-path fading channel with information bit
throughput R not falling below a specified value. The test stresses the
multicode reception and channel decoding with incremental redundancy.

#### 9.2.1LA.4 Method of test

##### 9.2.1LA.4.1 Initial conditions {#la.4.1-initial-conditions .H6}

Test environment: normal; see clauses G.2.1 and G.2.2.

Frequencies to be tested: mid range; see clause G.2.4.

1\) Connect the SS (node B emulator) and fader and AWGN noise source to
the UE antenna connector as shown in figure A.39 for UEs that support
receive diversity

2\) Set up an HSDPA call with according to TS 34.108 \[3\] clause 7.3.13
with levels according to table E.5.0.

3\) Set the node B emulator behaviour according to table 9.2.4. Set the
test parameters for test 1-2 according to table 9.2.1LA.1 and levels
according to tables 9.2.1LA.3 to 9.2.1LA.4 as appropriate for both the
serving HS-DSCH cell and secondary serving HS-DSCH cell. The
configuration of the downlink channels is defined as per E.5E and table
E.5.1 for the serving HS-DSCH cell and for secondary serving HS-DSCH
cell setup P-CPICH, HS-PDSCH and HS-SCCH channels as per E.5E and table
E.5.1

4\) The information bit data shall be pseudo random and not repeated
before 10 different information bit payload blocks are processed. (e.g.
Fixed reference Channel Definition H-set 6 (QPSK): The information bit
payload block is 6438 bits long. Hence the PRBSequence must be at least
6438 \* 10 bits long. ) Use a PRBS from ITU-T O.153 Ref \[27\]

5\) The SS shall not time the transmission freely. It shall time the
transmission strictly according to the reference measurement channels:
i.e. Process number is continued exactly after 6 TTIs.

6\) Setup the fading simulator with fading conditions as described in
table D.2.2.1A.

##### 9.2.1LA.4.2 Procedure {#la.4.2-procedure .H6}

1\) Once the HSDPA connection is setup, change levels according to Table
E.5.6 to E.5.8B as specified by table E.5.9 and start transmitting HSDPA
Data on both the serving cells. For secondary serving HS-DSCH cell only
P-CPICH, HS-PDSCH and HS-SCCH are configured.

2\) For all relevant propagation conditions, for all relevant Ioc
levels, for all relevant Ec/Ior, for all relevant Îor/Ioc, for all
relevant H-sets in tables 9.2.1LA.3 to 9.2.1LA.4 count the number of
NACK, ACK and statDTX on the UL HS-DPCCH during the test interval on
both the cells and decide pass or fail according to Annex F.6.3 table
F.6.3.5.2.7D. Throughput is measured per cell in 2 part tests according
to table 9.2.1LA.2A

3\) To swap from part test 1 to part test 2, terminate the call and
repeat the test, starting from initial conditions step 1 with the other
part test connection in A.39.

+----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+

#### 9.2.1LA.5 Test Requirements

Tables 9.2.1LA.3 to 9.2.1LA.4 define the primary level settings
including test tolerance for all relevant throughput tests. The pass /
fail decision for throughput is done according to Annex F.6.3, where the
test time is applicable per part test. The sum of all the collected
throughputs from each carrier shall be compared against the reference
value in the test requirements, including note 3.

Table E.5.6 to E.5.8B define the secondary and subsequently ranked level
settings including test tolerance to be applied on both the serving
cells. As those level settings are not uniform for the throughput tests
in this clause, Table E.5.9 indicates which levels are applied, when the
primary level settings (Ec/Ior and Ior/Ioc) and propagation conditions
(PB3, VA30) vary.

### 9.2.1LB Enhanced Performance Requirements Type 3i - QPSK, Fixed Reference Channel (FRC) H-Set 6A for DB-DC-HSDPA

#### 9.2.1LB.1 Definition and applicability

The receiver single link performance of the High Speed Physical Downlink
Shared Channel (HS-DSCH) in different multi-path fading environments are
determined by the information bit throughput R.

The requirements and this test apply for Release 9 and later releases to
all types of UTRA for the FDD UE that support: DB-DC-HSDPA UE capability
categories 21-28, and the optional enhanced performance requirements
type 3i.

#### 9.2.1LB.2 Minimum requirements

The performance requirements for a particular UE belonging to a certain
HS-DSCH category and supporting the optional enhanced performance
requirements type 3i are determined according to the relevant part of
Table 9.2.3E.

During the Fixed Reference Channel (FRC) tests the behaviour of the
Node-B emulator in response to the ACK/NACK signalling field of the
HS-DPCCH is specified in Table 9.2.4.

The requirements are specified in terms of a minimum information bit
throughput R for the DL reference channel H-Set 6A specified in Annex
C.8.1.6 with the addition of the relevant parameters in Table 9.2.1LB.1
and the downlink physical channel setup according to table E.5.1.

Using this configuration the throughput shall meet or exceed the minimum
requirements specified in tables 9.2.1LB.2.

+----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+

For DC-HSDPA, DB-DC-HSDPA or 4C-HSDPA tests which require more than 8
independent faders, the resulting propagation channel(s) shall be
generated by considering a number of independent faders needed for one
carrier and connecting them to the signal of randomly chosen carrier(s).
The maximum number of channel faders on the test will be less than or
equal to 8. The remaining carrier(s) shall be connected without a
channel fader but with AWGN. The throughput shall be collected only for
the carrier(s) connected to channel faders.

The test shall be repeated by choosing carrier(s) excluding already
chosen carrier(s) until all the carrier(s) are tested under fading
conditions. The sum of all the collected throughputs from each carrier
shall be compared against the reference value in the requirements.

All supported carriers shall be configured and activated during the
test.

The reference for this requirement is TS 25.101 \[1\] clauses 9.2.1.4
and C.5.4.

#### 9.2.1LB.3 Test purpose

To verify the ability of the receiver to receive a predefined test
signal, representing a multi-path fading channel with information bit
throughput R not falling below a specified value. The test stresses the
multicode reception and channel decoding with incremental redundancy.

#### 9.2.1LB.4 Method of test

##### 9.2.1LB.4.1 Initial conditions {#lb.4.1-initial-conditions .H6}

Test environment: normal; see clauses G.2.1 and G.2.2.

Frequencies to be tested: mid range; see clause G.2.4.

1\) Connect the SS (node B emulator) and fader and AWGN noise source to
the UE antenna connector as shown in figure A.45.

2\) Set up an HSDPA call according to TS 34.108 \[3\] clause 7.3.13 with
levels according to table E.5.0.

3\) Set the node B emulator behaviour according to table 9.2.4. Set the
test parameters for test 1-2 according to table 9.2.1LB.1 and levels
according to tables 9.2.1LB.4 to 9.2.1LB.5 as appropriate for both the
serving HS-DSCH cell and secondary serving HS-DSCH cell. The
configuration of the downlink channels is defined as per E.5E and table
E.5.1 for the serving HS-DSCH cell and for secondary serving HS-DSCH
cell setup P-CPICH, HS-PDSCH and HS-SCCH channels as per E.5E and table
E.5.1.

4\) The information bit data shall be pseudo random and not repeated
before 10 different information bit payload blocks are processed. (e.g.
Fixed reference Channel Definition H-set 6 (QPSK): The information bit
payload block is 6438 bits long. Hence the PRBSequence must be at least
6438 \* 10 bits long. ) Use a PRBS from ITU-T O.153 Ref \[27\].

5\) The SS shall not time the transmission freely. It shall time the
transmission strictly according to the reference measurement channels:
i.e. Process number is continued exactly after 6 TTIs.

6\) Setup the fading simulator with fading conditions as described in
table D.2.2.1A.

##### 9.2.1LB.4.2 Procedure {#lb.4.2-procedure .H6}

1\) Once the HSDPA connection is setup, change levels according to Table
E.5.6 to E.5.8B as specified by table E.5.9 and start transmitting HSDPA
Data on both the serving cells. For secondary serving HS-DSCH cell only
P-CPICH, HS-PDSCH and HS-SCCH are configured.

2\) For all relevant propagation conditions, for all relevant Ioc
levels, for all relevant Ec/Ior, for all relevant Îor/Ioc, for all
relevant H-sets in tables 9.2.1LB.4 to 9.2.1LB.5 count the number of
NACK, ACK and statDTX on the UL HS-DPCCH during the test interval on
both the cells and decide pass or fail according to Annex F.6.3 table
F.6.3.5.2.7D.Throughput is measured per cell in 2 part tests according
to table 9.2.1LB.3

+----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+

3\) To swap from part test 1 to part test 2, terminate the call and
repeat the test, starting from initial conditions step 1 with the other
part test connection in A.43.

#### 9.2.1LB.5 Test Requirements

Tables 9.2.1LB.4 to 9.2.1LB.5 define the primary level settings
including test tolerance for all relevant throughput tests. The pass /
fail decision for throughput is done according to Annex F.6.3, where the
test time is applicable per part test. The sum of all the collected
throughputs from each carrier shall be compared against the reference
value in the test requirements, including note 3

Table E.5.6 to E.5.8B define the secondary and subsequently ranked level
settings including test tolerance to be applied on both the serving
cells. As those level settings are not uniform for the throughput tests
in this clause, Table E.5.9 indicates which levels are applied, when the
primary level settings (Ec/Ior and Ior/Ioc) and propagation conditions
(PB3, VA30) vary.

### 9.2.1LC Enhanced Performance Requirements Type 3i - QPSK, Fixed Reference Channel (FRC) H-Set 6B

#### 9.2.1LC.1 Definition and applicability

The receiver single link performance of the High Speed Physical Downlink
Shared Channel (HS-DSCH) in different multi-path fading environments are
determined by the information bit throughput R.

The requirements and this test apply for Release 10 and later releases
to all types of UTRA for the FDD UE that support 4C-HSDPA and HSDPA UE
capability categories 29 or 30 and support the optional enhanced
performance requirements type 3i.

#### 9.2.1LC.2 Minimum requirements

The performance requirements for a particular UE belonging to HS-DSCH
category 29-30 and supporting the optional enhanced performance
requirements type 3i are determined according to the relevant part of
Table 9.2.3G.

During the Fixed Reference Channel (FRC) tests the behaviour of the
Node-B emulator in response to the ACK/NACK signalling field of the
HS-DPCCH is specified in Table 9.2.4.

The requirements are specified in terms of a minimum information bit
throughput R for the DL reference channel H-Set 6B specified in Annex
C.8.1.8 with the addition of the relevant parameters in Table 9.2.1LC.1
and the downlink physical channel setup according to table E.5.1A.

Using this configuration the throughput shall meet or exceed the minimum
requirements specified in tables 9.2.1LC.2.

+----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+

For DC-HSDPA, DB-DC-HSDPA or 4C-HSDPA tests which require more than 8
independent faders, the resulting propagation channel(s) shall be
generated by considering a number of independent faders needed for one
carrier and connecting them to the signal of randomly chosen carrier(s).
The maximum number of channel faders on the test will be less than or
equal to 8. The remaining carrier(s) shall be connected without a
channel fader but with AWGN. The throughput shall be collected only for
the carrier(s) connected to channel faders.

The test shall be repeated by choosing carrier(s) excluding already
chosen carrier(s) until all the carrier(s) are tested under fading
conditions. The sum of all the collected throughputs from each carrier
shall be compared against the reference value in the requirements.

All supported carriers shall be configured and activated during the
test.

The reference for this requirement is TS 25.101 \[1\] clauses 9.2.1.4
and C.5.4.

#### 9.2.1LC.3 Test purpose

To verify the ability of the receiver to receive a predefined test
signal, representing a multi-path fading channel with information bit
throughput R not falling below a specified value. The test stresses the
multicode reception and channel decoding with incremental redundancy.

#### 9.2.1LC.4 Method of test

##### 9.2.1LC.4.1 Initial conditions {#lc.4.1-initial-conditions .H6}

Test environment: normal; see clauses G.2.1 and G.2.2.

Frequencies to be tested: mid range; see clause G.2.4.

1\) Connect the SS (node B emulator) and fader and AWGN noise source to
the UE antenna connector as shown in figure A.45.

2\) Set up an HSDPA call according to TS 34.108 \[3\] clause 7.3.16 with
levels according to table E.5.0.

3\) Set the node B emulator behaviour according to table 9.2.4. Set the
test parameters for test 1-2 according to table 9.2.1LC.1 and levels
according to tables 9.2.1LC.4 to 9.2.1LC.5 as appropriate for the
serving HS-DSCH cell and all the secondary serving HS-DSCH cell. The
configuration of the downlink channels is defined as per E.5E and table
E.5.1 for the serving HS-DSCH cell and for all the secondary serving
HS-DSCH cell setup P-CPICH, HS-PDSCH and HS-SCCH channels as per E.5E
and table E.5.1

4\) The information bit data shall be pseudo random and not repeated
before 10 different information bit payload blocks are processed. (e.g.
Fixed reference Channel Definition H-set 6 (QPSK): The information bit
payload block is 6438 bits long. Hence the PRBSequence must be at least
6438 \* 10 bits long. ) Use a PRBS from ITU-T O.153 Ref \[27\]

5\) The SS shall not time the transmission freely. It shall time the
transmission strictly according to the reference measurement channels:
i.e. Process number is continued exactly after 6 TTIs.

6\) Setup the fading simulator with fading conditions as described in
table D.2.2.1A.

##### 9.2.1LC.4.2 Procedure {#lc.4.2-procedure .H6}

1\) Once the HSDPA connection is setup, change levels according to Table
E.5.6 to E.5.8B as specified by table E.5.9 and start transmitting HSDPA
Data on all the serving cells. For secondary serving HS-DSCH cells only
P-CPICH, HS-PDSCH and HS-SCCH are configured.

2\) For all relevant propagation conditions, for all relevant Ioc
levels, for all relevant Ec/Ior, for all relevant Îor/Ioc, for all
relevant H-sets in tables 9.2.1LC.4 to 9.2.1LC.5 count the number of
NACK, ACK and statDTX on the UL HS-DPCCH during the test interval on
primary cell and all the secondary cells and decide pass or fail
according to Annex F.6.3 table F.6.3.5.2.7D.Throughput is measured per
cell in 3 part tests according to table 9.2.1LC.3.

3\) To swap from one part test to another part test, terminate the call
and repeat the test, starting from initial conditions step 1 with the
other part test connection in A.43.

#### 9.2.1LC.5 Test Requirements

Tables 9.2.1LC.4 to 9.2.1LC.5 define the primary level settings
including test tolerance for all relevant throughput tests. The pass /
fail decision for throughput is done according to Annex F.6.3, where the
test time is applicable per part test. The sum of all the collected
throughputs from each carrier shall be compared against the reference
value in the test requirements, including note 3.

Table E.5.6 to E.5.8B define the secondary and subsequently ranked level
settings including test tolerance to be applied on all the serving
cells. As those level settings are not uniform for the throughput tests
in this clause, Table E.5.9 indicates which levels are applied, when the
primary level settings (Ec/Ior and Ior/Ioc) and propagation conditions
(PB3, VA30) vary.

### 9.2.1LD Enhanced Performance Requirements Type 3i - QPSK, Fixed Reference Channel (FRC) H-Set 6C

#### 9.2.1LD.1 Definition and applicability

The receiver single link performance of the High Speed Physical Downlink
Shared Channel (HS-DSCH) in different multi-path fading environments are
determined by the information bit throughput R.

The requirements and this test apply for Release 10 and later releases
to all types of UTRA for the FDD UE that support 4C-HSDPA and HSDPA UE
capability categories 29 or 30 and support the optional enhanced
performance requirements type 3i.

#### 9.2.1LD.2 Minimum requirements

The performance requirements for a particular UE belonging to HS-DSCH
category 31-32 and supporting the optional enhanced performance
requirements type 3i are determined according to the relevant part of
Table 9.2.3G.

During the Fixed Reference Channel (FRC) tests the behaviour of the
Node-B emulator in response to the ACK/NACK signalling field of the
HS-DPCCH is specified in Table 9.2.4.

The requirements are specified in terms of a minimum information bit
throughput R for the DL reference channel H-Set 6C specified in Annex
C.8.1.8 with the addition of the relevant parameters in Table 9.2.1LD.1
and the downlink physical channel setup according to table E.5.1A.

Using this configuration the throughput shall meet or exceed the minimum
requirements specified in tables 9.2.1LD.2.

+----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+

For DC-HSDPA, DB-DC-HSDPA or 4C-HSDPA tests which require more than 8
independent faders, the resulting propagation channel(s) shall be
generated by considering a number of independent faders needed for one
carrier and connecting them to the signal of randomly chosen carrier(s).
The maximum number of channel faders on the test will be less than or
equal to 8. The remaining carrier(s) shall be connected without a
channel fader but with AWGN. The throughput shall be collected only for
the carrier(s) connected to channel faders.

The test shall be repeated by choosing carrier(s) excluding already
chosen carrier(s) until all the carrier(s) are tested under fading
conditions. The sum of all the collected throughputs from each carrier
shall be compared against the reference value in the requirements.

All supported carriers shall be configured and activated during the
test.

The reference for this requirement is TS 25.101 \[1\] clauses 9.2.1.4
and C.5.4.

#### 9.2.1LD.3 Test purpose

To verify the ability of the receiver to receive a predefined test
signal, representing a multi-path fading channel with information bit
throughput R not falling below a specified value. The test stresses the
multicode reception and channel decoding with incremental redundancy.

#### 9.2.1LD.4 Method of test

##### 9.2.1LD.4.1 Initial conditions {#ld.4.1-initial-conditions .H6}

Test environment: normal; see clauses G.2.1 and G.2.2.

Frequencies to be tested: mid range; see clause G.2.4.

1\) Connect the SS (node B emulator) and fader and AWGN noise source to
the UE antenna connector as shown in figure A.45.

2\) Set up an HSDPA call according to TS 34.108 \[3\] clause 7.3.16 with
levels according to table E.5.0.

3\) Set the node B emulator behaviour according to table 9.2.4. Set the
test parameters for test 1-2 according to table 9.2.1LD.1 and levels
according to tables 9.2.1LD.4 to 9.2.1LD.5 as appropriate for the
serving HS-DSCH cell and all the secondary serving HS-DSCH cells. The
configuration of the downlink channels is defined as per E.5E and table
E.5.1 for the serving HS-DSCH cell. For all the secondary serving
HS-DSCH cell setup P-CPICH, HS-PDSCH and HS-SCCH channels as per E.5.E
and table E.5.1A

4\) The information bit data shall be pseudo random and not repeated
before 10 different information bit payload blocks are processed. (e.g.
Fixed reference Channel Definition H-set 6 (QPSK): The information bit
payload block is 6438 bits long. Hence the PRBSequence must be at least
6438 \* 10 bits long. ) Use a PRBS from ITU-T O.153 Ref \[27\]

5\) The SS shall not time the transmission freely. It shall time the
transmission strictly according to the reference measurement channels:
i.e. Process number is continued exactly after 6 TTIs.

6\) Setup the fading simulator with fading conditions as described in
table D.2.2.1A.

##### 9.2.1LD.4.2 Procedure {#ld.4.2-procedure .H6}

1\) Once the HSDPA connection is setup, change levels according to Table
E.5.6 to E.5.8B as specified by table E.5.9 and start transmitting HSDPA
Data on both the serving cells. For secondary serving HS-DSCH cells only
P-CPICH, HS-PDSCH and HS-SCCH are configured.

2\) For all relevant propagation conditions, for all relevant Ioc
levels, for all relevant Ec/Ior, for all relevant Îor/Ioc, for all
relevant H-sets in tables 9.2.1LD.4 to 9.2.1LD.5 count the number of
NACK, ACK and statDTX on the UL HS-DPCCH during the test interval on
primary cell and all the secondary cells and decide pass or fail
according to Annex F.6.3 table F.6.3.5.2.7D.Throughput is measured per
cell in 4 part tests according to table 9.2.1LD.3

3\) To swap from one part test to another part test , terminate the call
and repeat the test, starting from initial conditions step 1 with the
other part test connection in A.43.

#### 9.2.1LD.5 Test Requirements

Tables 9.2.1LD.4 to 9.2.1LD.5 define the primary level settings
including test tolerance for all relevant throughput tests. The pass /
fail decision for throughput is done according to Annex F.6.3, where the
test time is applicable per part test. The sum of all the collected
throughputs from each carrier shall be compared against the reference
value in the test requirements, including note 3

Table E.5.6 to E.5.8B define the secondary and subsequently ranked level
settings including test tolerance to be applied on all the serving
cells. As those level settings are not uniform for the throughput tests
in this clause, Table E.5.9 indicates which levels are applied, when the
primary level settings (Ec/Ior and Ior/Ioc) and propagation conditions
(PB3, VA30) vary.

### 9.2.1M Single Link Performance - Enhanced Performance Requirements Type 3i -- 16QAM/QPSK, Fixed Reference Channel (FRC) H-Set 6 for Multiflow HSDPA (2 cells)

Editor's note: This test case is incomplete. The following aspects are
either missing or not yet determined:

-   Connection diagram is FFS.

-   Test procedure may need to be modified to consider test steps with
    interferer and without interferer.

#### 9.2.1M.1 Definition and applicability

The receiver single link performance for Multiflow HSDPA in multi-path
fading environments is determined by the information bit throughput R.

The requirements and this test apply for Release 11 and later releases
to all types of UTRA for the FDD UE that support Multiflow HSDPA and
HSDPA UE capability categories 21-38.

#### 9.2.1M.2 Minimum requirements

The performance requirements for a particular UE belonging to a certain
HS-DSCH category and supporting the optional enhanced performance
requirements type 3i are determined according to the relevant part of
Table 9.2.3E.

During the Fixed Reference Channel (FRC) tests the behaviour of the
Node-B emulator in response to the ACK/NACK signalling field of the
HS-DPCCH is specified in Table 9.2.4.

The requirements are specified in terms of minimum information bit
throughput R for the DL reference channels H-set 6 16QAM (HS-DSCH
serving cell) and QPSK (assisting HS-DSCH serving cell) specified in
Annex C.8.1.6, with the addition of the relevant parameters in Tables
9.2.1M.1 plus the downlink physical channel setup according to Table E.5
F.1 to E.5 F.4 as applicable.

Using this configuration the throughput shall meet or exceed the minimum
requirements specified in tables 9.2.1M.2

The reference for this requirement is TS 25.101 \[1\] clause 9.2.5.1.

#### 9.2.1M.3 Test purpose

To verify the ability of the receiver with Multiflow HSDPA to receive a
predefined test signal, representing a multi-path fading channel with
information bit throughput R not falling below a specified value. The
test stresses the multicode reception and channel decoding with
incremental redundancy.

#### 9.2.1M.4 Method of test

##### 9.2.1M.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: normal; see clauses G.2.1 and G.2.2.

Frequencies to be tested: mid range; see clause G.2.4.

the UE antenna connector as shown in figure FFS.

2\) Set up an HSDPA call with looping back 12.2kbps RMC according to TS
34.108 \[3\] clause 7.3.6 with the following exception in the messages
in table 9.2.1M.3. These exceptions allows the call to be setup with 2
cells Multiflow HSDPA configuration with levels according to table E.5.0

3\) Set the node B emulator behaviour according to table 9.2.4. Set the
test parameters for tests 1-4 according to table 9.2.1M.1, and levels
according to table 9.2.1M.2. The configuration of the downlink channels
is defined in tables E.5F.1 to E.5F.4.

4\) The information bit data shall be pseudo random and not repeated
before 10 different information bit payload blocks are processed. (e.g.
Fixed reference Channel Definition H-set 6 (16 QAM): The information bit
payload block is 9377 bits long. Hence the PRBSequence must be at least
9377 \* 10 bits long. ) Use a PRBS from ITU-T O.153 Ref \[27\]

5\) The SS shall not time the transmission freely. It shall time the
transmission strictly according to the reference measurement channels:
i.e. Process number is continued exactly after 6 TTIs.

6\) Setup the fading simulator with fading conditions as described in
table D.2.2.1.A and clause D.2.6 on each of the cells..

##### 9.2.1M.4.2 Procedure

1\) Once the HSDPA connection is setup, change levels according to table
9.2.1M.4 and start transmitting HSDPA Data.

2\) For all relevant propagation conditions, for all relevant Ioc
levels, for all relevant Ec/Ior, for all relevant Îor/Ioc, for all
relevant H-sets in tables 9.2.1M.4 count the number of NACK, ACK and
statDTX on the UL HS-DPCCH during the test interval and decide pass or
fail according to Annex F.6.3 tables F.6.3.5.2.1A, F.6.3.5.2.5C and
F.6.3.5.2.6C.

### 9.2.1MA Single Link Performance - Enhanced Performance Requirements Type 3i -- 16QAM/QPSK, Fixed Reference Channel (FRC) H-Set 6 for Multiflow HSDPA (3 cells)

Editor's note: This test case is incomplete. The following aspects are
either missing or not yet determined:

-   The Test Tolerances applicable to this test are undefined..

-   Connection diagram is FFS.

-   Test procedure may need to be modified to consider test steps with
    interferer and without interferer

-   Test procedure may also need to take into account method to
    calculate ACK/NACK for all three DL cells.

#### 9.2.1MA.1 Definition and applicability

The receiver single link performance for Multiflow HSDPA in multi-path
fading environments is determined by the information bit throughput R.

The requirements and this test apply for Release 11 and later releases
to all types of UTRA for the FDD UE that support Multiflow HSDPA and
HSDPA UE capability categories 29-36, or 38.

#### 9.2.1MA.2 Minimum requirements

The performance requirements for a particular UE belonging to a certain
HS-DSCH category and supporting the optional enhanced performance
requirements type 3i are determined according to the relevant part of
Table 9.2.3G.

During the Fixed Reference Channel (FRC) tests the behaviour of the
Node-B emulator in response to the ACK/NACK signalling field of the
HS-DPCCH is specified in Table 9.2.4.

The requirements are specified in terms of minimum information bit
throughput R for the DL reference channels H-set 6 16QAM (HS-DSCH
serving cell) and QPSK (assisting HS-DSCH serving cell) specified in
Annex C.8.1.6, with the addition of the relevant parameters in Tables
9.2.1MA.1 plus the downlink physical channel setup according to table
E.5F.6.

Using this configuration the throughput shall meet or exceed the minimum
requirements specified in tables 9.2.1M.2

The reference for this requirement is TS 25.101 \[1\] clause 9.2.5.1.

#### 9.2.1MA.3 Test purpose

To verify the ability of the receiver with Multiflow HSDPA to receive a
predefined test signal, representing a multi-path fading channel with
information bit throughput R not falling below a specified value. The
test stresses the multicode reception and channel decoding with
incremental redundancy.

#### 9.2.1MA.4 Method of test

##### 9.2.1MA.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: normal; see clauses G.2.1 and G.2.2.

Frequencies to be tested: mid range; see clause G.2.4.

1\) Connect the SS (node B emulator) and fader and AWGN noise source to
the UE antenna connector as shown in figure FFS and depending upon
Multiflow HSDPA configuration, cell 3 would be added.

2\) Set up an HSDPA call with looping back 12.2kbps RMC according to TS
34.108 \[3\] clause 7.3.13 with the following exception in the messages
in table 9.2.1MA.3. These exceptions allows the call to be setup with 3
cells Multiflow HSDPA configuration with levels according to table E.5.0

3\) Set the node B emulator behaviour according to table 9.2.4. Set the
test parameters for tests 1-4 according to table 9.2.1MA.1, and levels
according to table 9.2.1MA.2. The configuration of the downlink channels
is defined in table E.5F.6.

4\) The information bit data shall be pseudo random and not repeated
before 10 different information bit payload blocks are processed. (E.g.
fixed reference Channel Definition H-set 6 (16 QAM): The information bit
payload block is 9377 bits long. Hence the PRBSequence must be at least
9377 \* 10 bits long. ) Use a PRBS from ITU-T O.153 Ref \[27\]

5\) The SS shall not time the transmission freely. It shall time the
transmission strictly according to the reference measurement channels:
i.e. Process number is continued exactly after 6 TTIs.

6\) Setup the fading simulator with fading conditions as described in
table D.2.2.1.A and clause D.2.6 on each of the cells.

##### 9.2.1MA.4.2 Procedure

1\) Once the HSDPA connection is setup, change levels according to table
9.2.1MA.4 and start transmitting HSDPA Data.

2\) For all relevant propagation conditions, for all relevant Ioc
levels, for all relevant Ec/Ior, for all relevant Îor/Ioc, for all
relevant H-sets in tables 9.2.1MA.4 count the number of NACK, ACK and
statDTX on the UL HS-DPCCH during the test interval and decide pass or
fail according to Annex F.6.3 tables F.6.3.5.2.1A, F.6.3.5.2.5C and
F.6.3.5.2.6C.

### 9.2.2 Open Loop Diversity Performance

The test cases in the following sections 9.2.2A to 9.2.2D define the
Open Loop Diversity Performance tests for the different H-Sets for the
different HS-DSCH Categories as defined in tables 9.2.1, 9.2.2 and
9.2.3.

### 9.2.2A Open Loop Diversity Performance - QPSK/16QAM, Fixed Reference Channel (FRC) H-Set 1/2/3

#### 9.2.2A.1 Definition and applicability

The receiver open loop transmit diversity performance of the High Speed
Physical Downlink Shared Channel (HS-DSCH) in multi-path fading
environments are determined by the information bit throughput R.

The requirements and this test apply to Release 5 and later releases for
all types of UTRA for FDD UE that support HSDPA UE capability categories
1 to 6 but not supporting the optional enhanced performance requirements
types 1, 2, 3, or 3i.

The requirements and this test apply for Release 6 and later releases to
all types of UTRA for the FDD UE that support HSDPA UE capability
categories 7 - 10 but not supporting the optional enhanced performance
requirements types 1, 2, 3, or 3i.

#### 9.2.2A.2 Minimum requirements

Requirements for a particular UE belonging to certain HS-DSCH category
are determined according to the relevant part of Table 9.2.1.

The requirements are specified in terms of minimum information bit
throughput R for the DL reference channels H-set 1/2/3 specified in
Annex C.8.1.1, C.8.1.2 and C.8.1.3 respectively, with the addition of
the relevant parameters in Tables 9.2.2A.1 and 9.2.2A.3 plus the
downlink physical channel setup according to table E.5.2.

Using this configuration the throughput shall meet or exceed the minimum
requirements specified in tables 9.2.2A.2 and 9.2.2A.4.

The reference for this requirement is TS 25.101 \[1\] clauses 9.2.2.1
and 9.2.2.2.

#### 9.2.2A.3 Test purpose

To verify the ability of the receiver to receive a predefined test
signal, representing a multi-path fading channel with information bit
throughput R not falling below a specified value. The test stresses the
multi-code reception and channel decoding with incremental redundancy.

#### 9.2.2A.4 Method of test

##### 9.2.2A.4.1 Initial conditions {#a.4.1-initial-conditions-1 .H6}

Test environment: normal; see clauses G.2.1 and G.2.2.

Frequencies to be tested: mid range; see clause G.2.4.

1.  Connect the SS (Node B Emulator) and faders and AWGN noise sources
    to the UE antenna connector as shown in figure A.12.

2\. Set the node B emulator behaviour according to table 9.2.4. Set the
test parameters for tests 1-3 according to table 9.2.2A.1 or 9.2.2A.3
and levels according to tables 9.2.2A.6 to 9.2.2A.9. The configuration
of the downlink channels is defined in table E.5.2.

3\. The information bit data shall be pseudo random and not repeated
before 10 different information bit payload blocks are processed. (e.g.
Fixed reference Channel Definition H-set 1 (16 QAM): The information bit
payload block is 4664 bits long. Hence the PRBS must be at least 4664 \*
10 bits long ) Use a PRBS from ITU-T O.153 Ref \[27\].

4\. Setup the fading simulators with fading conditions as described in
table D.2.2.1.A and clause D.2.7.

##### 9.2.2A.4.2 Procedure {#a.4.2-procedure-1 .H6}

1\. Set up a HSDPA with looping back 12.2kbps RMC connection according
to the generic HSDPA set-up procedure specified in TS 34.108 \[3\] sub
clause 7.3.6 with the exceptions for information elements listed in
table 9.2.2A.5, with levels according to table E.5.0.

2\. Once the HSDPA connection is setup, change levels according to
Tables E.5.6 to E.5.8B as specified by table E.5.9 and start
transmitting HSDPA Data.

3\. For all relevant propagation conditions, for all relevant Ioc
levels, for all relevant Ec/Ior, for all relevant Îor/Ioc, for all
relevant H-sets in tables 9.2.2A.6 to 9.2.2A.9 count the number of NACK,
ACK and statDTX on the UL HS-DPCCH during the test interval and decide
pass or fail according to Annex F.6.3 tables F.6.3.5.3.1 and
F.6.3.5.3.2. ACK is counted as a pass. NACK and statDTX are counted as a
failure.

##### 9.2.2A.5 Test Requirements {#a.5-test-requirements-1 .H6}

Tables 9.2.2A.6 to 9.2.2A.9 define the primary level settings including
test tolerance and test parameters for all relevant throughput tests.
The pass / fail decision for throughput is done according to Annex
F.6.3.

Tables E.5.6 to E.5.8B define the secondary and subsequently ranked
level settings including test tolerance. As those level settings are not
uniform for the throughput tests in this clause, Table E.5.9 indicates
which levels are applied, when the primary level settings (Ec/Ior and
Ior/Ioc) and propagation conditions (PA3,PB3, VA30, VA 120) vary.

Note that the levels in tables E.5.6 to E.5.8B, when applied in this
subclause (open loop transmit diversity) are equal to the sum of the
levels at both antennas. They are equally divided between both antennas
according to Table E.5.2: column Note.

### 9.2.2B Open Loop Diversity Performance - QPSK, Fixed Reference Channel (FRC) H-Set 4/5

#### 9.2.2B.1 Definition and applicability

The receiver open loop transmit diversity performance of the High Speed
Physical Downlink Shared Channel (HS-DSCH) in multi-path fading
environments are determined by the information bit throughput R.

The requirements and this test apply to Release 5 and later releases for
all types of UTRA for FDD UE that support HSDPA UE capability categories
11 and 12.

#### 9.2.2B.2 Minimum requirements

Requirements for a particular UE belonging to certain HS-DSCH category
are determined according to the relevant part of Table 9.2.1.

The requirements are specified in terms of minimum information bit
throughput R for the DL reference channels H-set 4/5 specified in Annex
C.8.1.4 and C.8.1.5 respectively, with the addition of the relevant
parameters in Table 9.2.2B.1 plus the downlink physical channel setup
according to table E.5.2.

Using this configuration the throughput shall meet or exceed the minimum
requirements specified in tables 9.2.2B.2 and 9.2.2B.3.

The reference for this requirement is TS 25.101 \[1\] clause 9.2.2.3.

#### 9.2.2B.3 Test purpose

To verify the ability of the receiver to receive a predefined test
signal, representing a multi-path fading channel with information bit
throughput R not falling below a specified value. The test stresses the
multi-code reception and channel decoding with incremental redundancy.

#### 9.2.2B.4 Method of test

##### 9.2.2B.4.1 Initial conditions {#b.4.1-initial-conditions-1 .H6}

Test environment: normal; see clauses G.2.1 and G.2.2.

Frequencies to be tested: mid range; see clause G.2.4.

1\. Connect the SS (Node B Emulator) and faders and AWGN noise sources
to the UE antenna connector as shown in figure A.22 for UEs that support
receive diversity or figure A.12 for UEs that do not support receive
diversity.

2\. Set the node B emulator behaviour according to table 9.2.4. Set the
test parameters for tests 1-3 according to table 9.2.2B.1 and levels
according to tables 9.2.2B.5 to 9.2.2B.7. The configuration of the
downlink channels is defined in table E.5.2.

3\. The information bit data shall be pseudo random and not repeated
before 10 different information bit payload blocks are processed. (e.g.
Fixed reference Channel Definition H-set 1 (16 QAM): The information bit
payload block is 4664 bits long. Hence the PRBS must be at least 4664 \*
10 bits long ) Use a PRBS from ITU-T O.153 Ref \[27\].

4\. Setup the fading simulators with fading conditions as described in
table D.2.2.1.A and clause D.2.7.

##### 9.2.2B.4.2 Procedure {#b.4.2-procedure-1 .H6}

1\. Set up a HSDPA connection with looping back 12.2kbps RMC according
to the generic HSDPA set-up procedure specified in TS 34.108 \[3\] sub
clause 7.3.6 with the exceptions for information elements listed in
table 9.2.2B.4, with levels according to table E.5.0.

2\. Once the HSDPA connection is setup, change levels according to
Tables E.5.6 to E.5.8B as specified by table E.5.9 and start
transmitting HSDPA Data.

3\. For all relevant propagation conditions, for all relevant Ioc
levels, for all relevant Ec/Ior, for all relevant Îor/Ioc, for all
relevant H-sets in tables 9.2.2B.5 to 9.2.2B.7 count the number of NACK,
ACK and statDTX on the UL HS-DPCCH during the test interval and decide
pass or fail according to Annex F.6.3 tables F.6.3.5.3.3 and
F.6.3.5.3.4. ACK is counted as a pass. NACK and statDTX are counted as a
failure.

##### 9.2.2B.5 Test Requirements {#b.5-test-requirements-1 .H6}

Tables 9.2.2B.5 to 9.2.2B.7 define the primary level settings including
test tolerance and test parameters for all relevant throughput tests.
The pass / fail decision for throughput is done according to Annex
F.6.3.

Tables E.5.6 to E.5.8B define the secondary and subsequently ranked
level settings including test tolerance. As those level settings are not
uniform for the throughput tests in this clause, Table E.5.9 indicates
which levels are applied, when the primary level settings (Ec/Ior and
Ior/Ioc) and propagation conditions (PA3,PB3, VA30, VA 120) vary.

Note that the levels in tables E.5.6 to E.5.8B, when applied in this
subclause (open loop transmit diversity) are equal to the sum of the
levels at both antennas. They are equally divided between both antennas
according to Table E.5.2: column Note.

### 9.2.2C Open Loop Diversity Performance - Enhanced Performance Requirements Type 1 - QPSK/16QAM, Fixed Reference Channel (FRC) H-Set 1/2/3

#### 9.2.2C.1 Definition and applicability

The receiver open loop transmit diversity performance of the High Speed
Physical Downlink Shared Channel (HS-DSCH) in multi-path fading
environments are determined by the information bit throughput R.

The requirements and this test apply for Release 6 and later releases to
all types of UTRA for the FDD UE that support HSDPA UE capability
categories 1 to 10 and the optional enhanced performance requirements
type 1.

#### 9.2.2C.2 Minimum requirements

Requirements for a particular UE belonging to certain HS-DSCH category
are determined according to the relevant parts of Table 9.2.2..

The requirements are specified in terms of minimum information bit
throughput R for the DL reference channels H-set 1/2/3 specified in
Annex C.8.1.1, C.8.1.2 and C.8.1.3 respectively, with the addition of
the relevant parameters in Tables 9.2.2C.1 and 9.2.2C.3 plus the
downlink physical channel setup according to table E.5.2.

Using this configuration the throughput shall meet or exceed the minimum
requirements specified in tables 9.2.2C.2 and 9.2.2C.4.

The reference for this requirement is TS 25.101 \[1\] clauses 9.2.2.1
and 9.2.2.2.

#### 9.2.2C.3 Test purpose

To verify the ability of the receiver to receive a predefined test
signal, representing a multi-path fading channel with information bit
throughput R not falling below a specified value. The test stresses the
multi-code reception and channel decoding with incremental redundancy.

#### 9.2.2C.4 Method of test

##### 9.2.2C.4.1 Initial conditions {#c.4.1-initial-conditions-1 .H6}

Test environment: normal; see clauses G.2.1 and G.2.2.

Frequencies to be tested: mid range; see clause G.2.4.

1\. Connect the SS (Node B Emulator) and faders and AWGN noise sources
to the UE antenna connector as shown in figure A.22 for UEs that support
receive diversity or figure A.12 for UEs that do not support receive
diversity.

2\. Set the node B emulator behaviour according to table 9.2.4. Set the
test parameters for tests 1-3 according to table 9.2.2C.1 or 9.2.2C.3
and levels according to tables 9.2.2C.6 to 9.2.2C.9. The configuration
of the downlink channels is defined in table E.5.2.

3\. The information bit data shall be pseudo random and not repeated
before 10 different information bit payload blocks are processed. (e.g.
Fixed reference Channel Definition H-set 1 (16 QAM): The information bit
payload block is 4664 bits long. Hence the PRBS must be at least 4664 \*
10 bits long ) Use a PRBS from ITU-T O.153 Ref \[27\].

4\. Setup the fading simulators with fading conditions as described in
table D.2.2.1.A and clause D.2.5.

##### 9.2.2C.4.2 Procedure {#c.4.2-procedure-1 .H6}

1\. Set up a HSDPA connection with looping back 12.2kbps RMC according
to the generic HSDPA set-up procedure specified in TS 34.108 \[3\] sub
clause 7.3.6 with the exceptions for information elements listed in
table 9.2.2C.5, with levels according to table E.5.0.

2\. Once the HSDPA connection is setup, change levels according to
Tables E.5.6 to E.5.8B as specified by table E.5.9 and start
transmitting HSDPA Data.

3\. For all relevant propagation conditions, for all relevant Ioc
levels, for all relevant Ec/Ior, for all relevant Îor/Ioc, for all
relevant H-sets in tables 9.2.2C.6 to 9.2.2C.9 count the number of NACK,
ACK and statDTX on the UL HS-DPCCH during the test interval and decide
pass or fail according to Annex F.6.3 tables F.6.3.5.3.5 and
F.6.3.5.3.6. ACK is counted as a pass. NACK and statDTX are counted as a
failure.

##### 9.2.2C.5 Test Requirements {#c.5-test-requirements-1 .H6}

Tables 9.2.2C.6 to 9.2.2C.9 define the primary level settings including
test tolerance and test parameters for all relevant throughput tests.
The pass / fail decision for throughput is done according to Annex
F.6.3.

Tables E.5.6 to E.5.8B define the secondary and subsequently ranked
level settings including test tolerance. As those level settings are not
uniform for the throughput tests in this clause, Table E.5.9 indicates
which levels are applied, when the primary level settings (Ec/Ior and
Ior/Ioc) and propagation conditions (PA3,PB3, VA30, VA 120) vary.

Note that the levels in tables E.5.6 to E.5.8B, when applied in this
subclause (open loop transmit diversity) are equal to the sum of the
levels at both antennas. They are equally divided between both antennas
according to Table E.5.2: column Note.

### 9.2.2D Open Loop Diversity Performance - Enhanced Performance Requirements Type 2 - QPSK/16QAM, Fixed Reference Channel (FRC) H-Set 3

#### 9.2.2D.1 Definition and applicability

The receiver open loop transmit diversity performance of the High Speed
Physical Downlink Shared Channel (HS-DSCH) in multi-path fading
environments are determined by the information bit throughput R.

The requirements and this test apply to Release 6 and later releases for
all types of UTRA for FDD UE that support HSDPA UE capability categories
7 - 10 and the optional enhanced performance requirements type 2 but not
the optional enhanced performance requirements Type 3 or Type 3i.

The requirements and this test apply also for Release 7 and later
releases to all types of UTRA for the FDD UE that support: HSDPA UE
capability categories 13 and 14 but not the optional enhanced
performance requirements Type 3 or Type 3i.

#### 9.2.2D.2 Minimum requirements

Requirements for a particular UE belonging to certain HS-DSCH category
are determined according to the relevant part of Table 9.2.1.

The requirements are specified in terms of minimum information bit
throughput R for the DL reference channels H-set 3 specified in Annex
C.8.1.3, with the addition of the relevant parameters in Tables 9.2.2D.1
and 9.2.2D.3 plus the downlink physical channel setup according to table
E.5.2.

Using this configuration the throughput shall meet or exceed the minimum
requirements specified in tables 9.2.2D.2 and 9.2.2D.4.

NOTE: Tables 9.2.2D.2 and 9.2.2D.4 are based on core requirements for
minimum requirement as explained in Table 9.2.3.

The reference for this requirement is TS 25.101 \[1\] clauses 9.2.2.1
and 9.2.2.2.

#### 9.2.2D.3 Test purpose

To verify the ability of the receiver to receive a predefined test
signal, representing a multi-path fading channel with information bit
throughput R not falling below a specified value. The test stresses the
multi-code reception and channel decoding with incremental redundancy.

#### 9.2.2D.4 Method of test

##### 9.2.2D.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: normal; see clauses G.2.1 and G.2.2.

Frequencies to be tested: mid range; see clause G.2.4.

1\. Connect the SS (Node B Emulator) and faders and AWGN noise sources
to the UE antenna connector as shown in figure A.22 for UEs that support
receive diversity or figure A.12 for UEs that do not support receive
diversity.

2\. Set the node B emulator behaviour according to table 9.2.4. Set the
test parameters for tests 1-3 according to table 9.2.2D.1 or 9.2.2D.3
and levels according to tables 9.2.2D.6 to 9.2.2D.9. The configuration
of the downlink channels is defined in table E.5.2.

3\. The information bit data shall be pseudo random and not repeated
before 10 different information bit payload blocks are processed. (e.g.
Fixed reference Channel Definition H-set 1 (16 QAM): The information bit
payload block is 4664 bits long. Hence the PRBS must be at least 4664 \*
10 bits long ) Use a PRBS from ITU-T O.153 Ref \[27\].

4\. Setup the fading simulators with fading conditions as described in
table D.2.2.1.A and clause D.2.7.

##### 9.2.2D.4.2 Procedure

1\. Set up a HSDPA connection with looping back 12.2kbps RMC according
to the generic HSDPA set-up procedure specified in TS 34.108 \[3\] sub
clause 7.3.6 with the exceptions for information elements listed in
table 9.2.2D.5, with levels according to table E.5.0.

2\. Once the HSDPA connection is setup, change levels according to
Tables E.5.6 to E.5.8B as specified by table E.5.9 and start
transmitting HSDPA Data.

3\. For all relevant propagation conditions, for all relevant Ioc
levels, for all relevant Ec/Ior, for all relevant Îor/Ioc, for all
relevant H-sets in tables 9.2.2D.6 to 9.2.2D.9 count the number of NACK,
ACK and statDTX on the UL HS-DPCCH during the test interval and decide
pass or fail according to Annex F.6.3 tables F.6.3.5.3.1 and
F.6.3.5.3.2. ACK is counted as a pass. NACK and statDTX are counted as a
failure.

##### 9.2.2D.5 Test Requirements

Tables 9.2.2D.6 to 9.2.2D.9 define the primary level settings including
test tolerance and test parameters for all relevant throughput tests.
The pass / fail decision for throughput is done according to Annex
F.6.3.

Tables E.5.6 to E.5.8B define the secondary and subsequently ranked
level settings including test tolerance. As those level settings are not
uniform for the throughput tests in this clause, Table E.5.9 indicates
which levels are applied, when the primary level settings (Ec/Ior and
Ior/Ioc) and propagation conditions (PA3,PB3, VA30, VA 120) vary.

Note that the levels in tables E.5.6 to E.5.8B, when applied in this
subclause (open loop transmit diversity) are equal to the sum of the
levels at both antennas. They are equally divided between both antennas
according to Table E.5.2: column Note.

### 9.2.2E Open Loop Diversity Performance - Enhanced Performance Requirements Type 3 - QPSK/16QAM, Fixed Reference Channel (FRC) H-Set 3

Editor's note: This test is copied from 9.2.2C with the change that only
H-Set3 is tested and that applicability is enhanced performance
requirements type 3 instead of type 1.

#### 9.2.2E.1 Definition and applicability

The receiver open loop transmit diversity performance of the High Speed
Physical Downlink Shared Channel (HS-DSCH) in multi-path fading
environments are determined by the information bit throughput R.

The requirements and this test apply for Release 7 and later releases to
all types of UTRA for the FDD UE that support HSDPA UE capability
categories 7 to 10, and 13 to 14, and the optional enhanced performance
requirements type 3.

The requirements and this test apply also for Release 7 and later
releases to all types of UTRA for the FDD UE that support HSDPA UE
capability categories 15 to 18.

The requirements and this test apply for Release 8 and later releases to
all types of UTRA for the FDD UE that support HSDPA UE capability
categories 7 to 10, and 13 to 14, and the optional enhanced performance
requirements type 3i.

The requirements and this test apply also for Release 8 and later
releases to all types of UTRA for the FDD UE that support HSDPA UE
capability categories 19 - 20.

#### 9.2.2E.2 Minimum requirements

Requirements for a particular UE belonging to certain HS-DSCH category
are determined according to the relevant parts of Table 9.2.3A.

The requirements are specified in terms of minimum information bit
throughput R for the DL reference channels H-set 1/2/3 specified in
Annex C.8.1.1, C.8.1.2 and C.8.1.3 respectively, with the addition of
the relevant parameters in Tables 9.2.2E.1 and 9.2.2E.3 plus the
downlink physical channel setup according to table E.5.2.

Using this configuration the throughput shall meet or exceed the minimum
requirements specified in tables 9.2.2E.2 and 9.2.2E.4.

NOTE: Tables 9.2.2E.2 and 9.2.2E.4 are based on core requirements for
enhanced requirement type 1 as explained in Table 9.2.3A.

The reference for this requirement is TS 25.101 \[1\] clauses 9.2.2.1
and 9.2.2.2.

#### 9.2.2E.3 Test purpose

To verify the ability of the receiver to receive a predefined test
signal, representing a multi-path fading channel with information bit
throughput R not falling below a specified value. The test stresses the
multi-code reception and channel decoding with incremental redundancy.

#### 9.2.2E.4 Method of test

##### 9.2.2E.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: normal; see clauses G.2.1 and G.2.2.

Frequencies to be tested: mid range; see clause G.2.4.

1\. Connect the SS (Node B Emulator) and faders and AWGN noise sources
to the UE antenna connector as shown in figure A.22 for UEs that support
receive diversity or figure A.12 for UEs that do not support receive
diversity.

2\. Set the node B emulator behaviour according to table 9.2.4. Set the
test parameters for tests 1-3 according to table 9.2.2E.1 or 9.2.2E.3
and levels according to tables 9.2.2E.6 to 9.2.2E.9. The configuration
of the downlink channels is defined in table E.5.2.

3\. The information bit data shall be pseudo random and not repeated
before 10 different information bit payload blocks are processed. (e.g.
Fixed reference Channel Definition H-set 1 (16 QAM): The information bit
payload block is 4664 bits long. Hence the PRBS must be at least 4664 \*
10 bits long ) Use a PRBS from ITU-T O.153 Ref \[27\].

4\. Setup the fading simulators with fading conditions as described in
table D.2.2.1.A and clause D.2.5.

##### 9.2.2E.4.2 Procedure

1\. Set up a HSDPA connection with looping back 12.2kbps RMC according
to the generic HSDPA set-up procedure specified in TS 34.108 \[3\] sub
clause 7.3.6 with the exceptions for information elements listed in
table 9.2.2E.5, with levels according to table E.5.0.

2\. Once the HSDPA connection is setup, change levels according to
Tables E.5.6 to E.5.8B as specified by table E.5.9 and start
transmitting HSDPA Data.

3\. For all relevant propagation conditions, for all relevant Ioc
levels, for all relevant Ec/Ior, for all relevant Îor/Ioc, for all
relevant H-sets in tables 9.2.2E.6 to 9.2.2E.9 count the number of NACK,
ACK and statDTX on the UL HS-DPCCH during the test interval and decide
pass or fail according to Annex F.6.3 tables F.6.3.5.3.5 and
F.6.3.5.3.6. ACK is counted as a pass. NACK and statDTX are counted as a
failure.

##### 9.2.2E.5 Test Requirements

Tables 9.2.2E.6 to 9.2.2E.9 define the primary level settings including
test tolerance and test parameters for all relevant throughput tests.
The pass / fail decision for throughput is done according to Annex
F.6.3.

Tables E.5.6 to E.5.8B define the secondary and subsequently ranked
level settings including test tolerance. As those level settings are not
uniform for the throughput tests in this clause, Table E.5.9 indicates
which levels are applied, when the primary level settings (Ec/Ior and
Ior/Ioc) and propagation conditions (PA3,PB3, VA30, VA 120) vary.

Note that the levels in tables E.5.6 to E.5.8B, when applied in this
subclause (open loop transmit diversity) are equal to the sum of the
levels at both antennas. They are equally divided between both antennas
according to Table E.5.2: column Note.

### 9.2.3 Closed Loop Diversity Performance

The test cases in the following sections 9.2.3A to 9.2.3D define the
Closed Loop Diversity Performance tests for the different H-Sets for the
different HS-DSCH Categories as defined in tables 9.2.1, 9.2.2 and
9.2.3.

### 9.2.3A Closed Loop Diversity Performance - QPSK/16QAM, Fixed Reference Channel (FRC) H-Set 1/2/3

#### 9.2.3A.1 Definition and applicability

The receiver closed loop transmit diversity performance of the High
Speed Physical Downlink Shared Channel (HS-DSCH) in multi-path fading
environments are determined by the information bit throughput R.

The requirements and this test apply to Release 5 and later releases for
all types of UTRA for FDD UE that support HSDPA UE capability categories
1 to 6 but not supporting the optional enhanced performance requirements
types 1, 2, 3 or 3i.

The requirements and this test apply also for Release 6 and later
releases to all types of UTRA for the FDD UE that support HSDPA UE
capability categories 7 - 10 but not supporting the optional enhanced
performance requirements types 1, 2, 3 or 3i.

#### 9.2.3A.2 Minimum requirements

Requirements for a particular UE belonging to certain HS-DSCH category
are determined according to the relevant part of Table 9.2.1.

The requirements are specified in terms of minimum information bit
throughput R for the DL reference channels H-set 1/2/3 specified in
Annex C.8.1.1, C.8.1.2 and C.8.1.3 respectively, with the addition of
the relevant parameters in tables 9.2.3A.1 and 9.2.3A.3 plus the
downlink physical channel setup according to table E.5.3.

Using this configuration the throughput shall meet or exceed the minimum
requirements specified in tables 9.2.3A.2 and 9.2.3A.4.

The reference for this requirement is TS 25.101 \[1\] clauses 9.2.3.1
and 9.2.3.2.

#### 9.2.3A.3 Test purpose

To verify the ability of the receiver to receive a predefined test
signal, representing a multi-path fading channel with information bit
throughput R not falling below a specified value. The test stresses the
multi-code reception and channel decoding with incremental redundancy.

#### 9.2.3A.4 Method of test

##### 9.2.3A.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: normal; see clauses G.2.1 and G.2.2.

Frequencies to be tested: mid range; see clause G.2.4.

1\. Connect the SS ( Node B Emulator) and faders and AWGN noise sources
to the UE antenna connector as shown in figure A.12.

2\. Set the node B emulator behaviour according to table 9.2.4. Set the
test parameters for tests 1-3 according to table 9.2.3A.1 or 9.2.3A.3
and levels according to tables 9.2.3A.6 to 9.2.3A.9. The configuration
of the downlink channels is defined in table E.5.3.

3\. The information bit data shall be pseudo random and not repeated
before 10 different information bit payload blocks are processed. (e.g.
Fixed reference Channel Definition H-set 1 (16 QAM): The information bit
payload block is 4664 bits long. Hence the PRBS must be at least 4664 \*
10 bits long ) Use a PRBS from ITU-T O.153 Ref \[27\].

4\. Setup the fading simulators with fading conditions as described in
table D.2.2.1.A and clause D.2.7.

##### 9.2.3A.4.2 Procedure

1\. Set up a HSDPA connection with looping back 12.2kbps RMC according
to the generic HSDPA set-up procedure specified in TS 34.108 \[3\] sub
clause 7.3.6 with the exceptions for information elements listed in
table 9.2.3A.5, with levels according to table E.5.0.

2\. Once the HSDPA connection is setup, change levels according to
Tables E.5.6 to E.5.8B as specified by table E.5.9 and start
transmitting HSDPA Data.

3\. For all relevant propagation conditions, for all relevant Ioc
levels, for all relevant Ec/Ior, for all relevant Îor/Ioc, for all
relevant H-sets in tables 9.2.3A.6 to 9.2.3A.9 count the number of NACK,
ACK and statDTX on the UL HS-DPCCH during the test interval and decide
pass or fail according to Annex F.6.3 tables F.6.3.5.4.1 and
F.6.3.5.4.2. ACK is counted as a pass. NACK and statDTX are counted as a
failure.

#### 9.2.3A.5 Test Requirements

Tables 9.2.3A.6 to 9.2.3A.9 define the primary level settings including
test tolerance and test parameters for all relevant throughput tests.
The pass / fail decision for throughput is done according to Annex
F.6.3.

Tables E.5.6 to E.5.8B define the secondary and subsequently ranked
level settings including test tolerance. As those level settings are not
uniform for the throughput tests in this clause, Table E.5.9 indicates
which levels are applied, when the primary level settings (Ec/Ior and
Ior/Ioc) and propagation conditions (PA3, PB3, VA30, VA 120) vary.

Note that the levels in tables E.5.6 to E.5.8B, when applied in this
subclause (closed loop transmit diversity) are equal to the sum of the
levels at both antennas. They are equally divided between both antennas
according to Table E.5.3: column Note.

### 9.2.3B Closed Loop Diversity Performance - QPSK, Fixed Reference Channel (FRC) H-Set 4/5

#### 9.2.3B.1 Definition and applicability

The receiver closed loop transmit diversity performance of the High
Speed Physical Downlink Shared Channel (HS-DSCH) in multi-path fading
environments are determined by the information bit throughput R.

The requirements and this test apply to Release 5 and later releases for
all types of UTRA for FDD UE that support HSDPA UE capability categories
11 and 12

#### 9.2.3B.2 Minimum requirements

Requirements for a particular UE belonging to certain HS-DSCH category
are determined according to the relevant part of Table 9.2.1.

The requirements are specified in terms of minimum information bit
throughput R for the DL reference channels H-set 4/5 specified in Annex
C.8.1.4 and C.8.1.5 respectively, with the addition of the relevant
parameters in Tables 9.2.3B.1 plus the downlink physical channel setup
according to table E.5.3.

Using this configuration the throughput shall meet or exceed the minimum
requirements specified in tables 9.2.3B.2 and 9.2.3B.3.

The reference for this requirement is TS 25.101 \[1\] clause 9.2.3.3.

#### 9.2.3B.3 Test purpose

To verify the ability of the receiver to receive a predefined test
signal, representing a multi-path fading channel with information bit
throughput R not falling below a specified value. The test stresses the
multi-code reception and channel decoding with incremental redundancy.

#### 9.2.3B.4 Method of test

##### 9.2.3B.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: normal; see clauses G.2.1 and G.2.2.

Frequencies to be tested: mid range; see clause G.2.4.

1\. Connect the SS (Node B Emulator) and faders and AWGN noise sources
to the UE antenna connector as shown in figure A.22 for UEs that support
receive diversity or figure A.12 for UEs that do not support receive
diversity.

2\. Set the node B emulator behaviour according to table 9.2.4. Set the
test parameters for tests 1-3 according to table 9.2.3B.1 and levels
according to tables 9.2.3B.5 to 9.2.3B.7. The configuration of the
downlink channels is defined in table E.5.3.

3\. The information bit data shall be pseudo random and not repeated
before 10 different information bit payload blocks are processed. (e.g.
Fixed reference Channel Definition H-set 1 (16 QAM): The information bit
payload block is 4664 bits long. Hence the PRBS must be at least 4664 \*
10 bits long ) Use a PRBS from ITU-T O.153 Ref \[27\].

4\. Setup the fading simulators with fading conditions as described in
table D.2.2.1.A and clause D.2.7.

##### 9.2.3B.4.2 Procedure

1\. Set up a HSDPA connection with looping back 12.2kbps RMC according
to the generic HSDPA set-up procedure specified in TS 34.108 \[3\] sub
clause 7.3.6 with the exceptions for information elements listed in
table 9.2.3B.4, with levels according to table E.5.0.

2\. Once the HSDPA connection is setup, change levels according to
Tables E.5.6 to E.5.8B as specified by table E.5.9 and start
transmitting HSDPA Data.

3\. For all relevant propagation conditions, for all relevant Ioc
levels, for all relevant Ec/Ior, for all relevant Îor/Ioc, for all
relevant H-sets in tables 9.2.3B.5 to 9.2.3B.7 count the number of NACK,
ACK and statDTX on the UL HS-DPCCH during the test interval and decide
pass or fail according to Annex F.6.3 tables F.6.3.5.4.3 and
F.6.3.5.4.4. ACK is counted as a pass. NACK and statDTX are counted as a
failure.

#### 9.2.3B.5 Test Requirements

Tables 9.2.3B.5 to 9.2.3B.7 define the primary level settings including
test tolerance and test parameters for all relevant throughput tests.
The pass / fail decision for throughput is done according to Annex
F.6.3.

Tables E.5.6 to E.5.8B define the secondary and subsequently ranked
level settings including test tolerance. As those level settings are not
uniform for the throughput tests in this clause, Table E.5.9 indicates
which levels are applied, when the primary level settings (Ec/Ior and
Ior/Ioc) and propagation conditions (PA3, PB3, VA30, VA 120) vary.

Note that the levels in tables E.5.6 to E.5.8B, when applied in this
subclause (closed loop transmit diversity) are equal to the sum of the
levels at both antennas. They are equally divided between both antennas
according to Table E.5.3: column Note.

The reference for this requirement is TS 25.101 \[1\] clauses 9.2.3.1
and 9.2.3.2.

#### 9.2.3C.3 Test purpose

To verify the ability of the receiver to receive a predefined test
signal, representing a multi-path fading channel with information bit
throughput R not falling below a specified value. The test stresses the
multi-code reception and channel decoding with incremental redundancy.

#### 9.2.3C.4 Method of test

##### 9.2.3C.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: normal; see clauses G.2.1 and G.2.2.

Frequencies to be tested: mid range; see clause G.2.4.

1\. Connect the SS (Node B Emulator) and faders and AWGN noise sources
to the UE antenna connector as shown in figure A.22 for UEs that support
receive diversity or figure A.12 for UEs that do not support receive
diversity.

2\. Set the node B emulator behaviour according to table 9.2.4. Set the
test parameters for tests 1-3 according to table 9.2.3C.1 or 9.2.3C.3
and levels according to tables 9.2.3C.6 to 9.2.3C.9. The configuration
of the downlink channels is defined in table E.5.3.

3\. The information bit data shall be pseudo random and not repeated
before 10 different information bit payload blocks are processed. (e.g.
Fixed reference Channel Definition H-set 1 (16 QAM): The information bit
payload block is 4664 bits long. Hence the PRBS must be at least 4664 \*
10 bits long ) Use a PRBS from ITU-T O.153 Ref \[27\].

4\. Setup the fading simulators with fading conditions as described in
table D.2.2.1.A and clause D.2.5.

##### 9.2.3C.4.2 Procedure

1\. Set up a HSDPA connection with looping back 12.2kbps RMC according
to the generic HSDPA set-up procedure specified in TS 34.108 \[3\] sub
clause 7.3.6 with the exceptions for information elements listed in
table 9.2.3C.5, with levels according to table E.5.0.

2\. Once the HSDPA connection is setup, change levels according to
Tables E.5.6 to E.5.8B as specified by table E.5.9 and start
transmitting HSDPA Data.

3\. For all relevant propagation conditions, for all relevant Ioc
levels, for all relevant Ec/Ior, for all relevant Îor/Ioc, for all
relevant H-sets in tables 9.2.3C.6 to 9.2.3C.9 count the number of NACK,
ACK and statDTX on the UL HS-DPCCH during the test interval and decide
pass or fail according to Annex F.6.3 tables F.6.3.5.4.1 and
F.6.3.5.4.2. ACK is counted as a pass. NACK and statDTX are counted as a
failure.

#### 9.2.3C.5 Test Requirements

Tables 9.2.3C.6 to 9.2.3C.9 define the primary level settings including
test tolerance and test parameters for all relevant throughput tests.
The pass / fail decision for throughput is done according to Annex
F.6.3.

Tables E.5.6 to E.5.8B define the secondary and subsequently ranked
level settings including test tolerance. As those level settings are not
uniform for the throughput tests in this clause, Table E.5.9 indicates
which levels are applied, when the primary level settings (Ec/Ior and
Ior/Ioc) and propagation conditions (PA3, PB3, VA30, VA 120) vary.

Note that the levels in tables E.5.6 to E.5.8B, when applied in this
subclause (closed loop transmit diversity) are equal to the sum of the
levels at both antennas. They are equally divided between both antennas
according to Table E.5.3: column Note.

### 9.2.3D Closed Loop Diversity Performance - Enhanced Performance Requirements Type 2 - QPSK/16QAM, Fixed Reference Channel (FRC) H-Set 6/3

#### 9.2.3D.1 Definition and applicability

The receiver closed loop transmit diversity performance of the High
Speed Physical Downlink Shared Channel (HS-DSCH) in multi-path fading
environments are determined by the information bit throughput R.

The requirements and this test apply for Release 6 and later releases to
all types of UTRA for the FDD UE that support HSDPA UE capability
categories 7 - 10 and the optional enhanced performance requirements
type 2 but not the optional enhanced performance requirements Type 3 or
Type 3i.

The requirements and this test apply also for Release 7 and later
releases to all types of UTRA for the FDD UE that support: HSDPA UE
capability categories 13 and 14 but not the optional enhanced
performance requirements Type 3 or Type 3i.

#### 9.2.3D.2 Minimum requirements

Requirements for a particular UE belonging to certain HS-DSCH category
are determined according to the relevant part of Table 9.2.3.

The requirements are specified in terms of minimum information bit
throughput R for the DL reference channels H-set 6/3 specified in Annex
C.8.1.6 and C.8.1.3 respectively, with the addition of the relevant
parameters in Tables 9.2.3D.1, 9.2.3D.3, 9.2.3D.5 and 9.2.3D.7 plus the
downlink physical channel setup according to table E.5.3.

Using this configuration the throughput shall meet or exceed the minimum
requirements specified in tables 9.2.3D.2, 9.2.3D.4, 9.2.3D.6 and
9.2.3D.8.

NOTE: Tables 9.2.3D.2, 9.2.3D.4, 9.2.3D.6 and 9.2.3D.8 are based on core
requirements for minimum requirement as explained in Table 9.2.3.

The reference for this requirement is TS 25.101 \[1\] clauses 9.2.3.1,
9.2.3.2, 9.2.3.4 and 9.2.3.5.

#### 9.2.3D.3 Test purpose

To verify the ability of the receiver to receive a predefined test
signal, representing a multi-path fading channel with information bit
throughput R not falling below a specified value. The test stresses the
multi-code reception and channel decoding with incremental redundancy.

#### 9.2.3D.4 Method of test

##### 9.2.3D.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: normal; see clauses G.2.1 and G.2.2.

Frequencies to be tested: mid range; see clause G.2.4.

1\. Connect the SS (Node B Emulator) and faders and AWGN noise sources
to the UE antenna connector as shown in figure A.22 for UEs that support
receive diversity or figure A.12 for UEs that do not support receive
diversity.

2\. Set the node B emulator behaviour according to table 9.2.4. Set the
test parameters for tests 1-3 according to table 9.2.3D.1, 9.2.3D.3,
9.2.3D.5 or 9.2.3D.7 and levels according to tables 9.2.3D.10 to
9.2.3D.17. The configuration of the downlink channels is defined in
table E.5.3.

3\. The information bit data shall be pseudo random and not repeated
before 10 different information bit payload blocks are processed. (e.g.
Fixed reference Channel Definition H-set 1 (16 QAM): The information bit
payload block is 4664 bits long. Hence the PRBS must be at least 4664 \*
10 bits long ) Use a PRBS from ITU-T O.153 Ref \[27\].

4\. Setup the fading simulators with fading conditions as described in
table D.2.2.1.A and clause D.2.7.

##### 9.2.3D.4.2 Procedure

1\. Set up a HSDPA connection with looping back 12.2kbps RMC according
to the generic HSDPA set-up procedure specified in TS 34.108 \[3\] sub
clause 7.3.6 with the exceptions for information elements listed in
table 9.2.3D.9, with levels according to table E.5.0.

2\. Once the HSDPA connection is setup, change levels according to
Tables E.5.6 to E.5.8B as specified by table E.5.9 and start
transmitting HSDPA Data.

3\. For all relevant propagation conditions, for all relevant Ioc
levels, for all relevant Ec/Ior, for all relevant Îor/Ioc, for all
relevant H-sets in tables 9.2.3D.10 to 9.2.3D.17 count the number of
NACK, ACK and statDTX on the UL HS-DPCCH during the test interval and
decide pass or fail according to Annex F.6.3 tables F.6.3.5.4.1,
F.6.3.5.4.2, F.6.3.5.4.5 and F.6.3.5.4.6. ACK is counted as a pass. NACK
and statDTX are counted as a failure.

#### 9.2.3D.5 Test Requirements

Tables 9.2.3D.10 to 9.2.3D.17 define the primary level settings
including test tolerance and test parameters for all relevant throughput
tests. The pass / fail decision for throughput is done according to
Annex F.6.3.

Tables E.5.6 to E.5.8B define the secondary and subsequently ranked
level settings including test tolerance. As those level settings are not
uniform for the throughput tests in this clause, Table E.5.9 indicates
which levels are applied, when the primary level settings (Ec/Ior and
Ior/Ioc) and propagation conditions (PA3, PB3, VA30, VA 120) vary.

Note that the levels in tables E.5.6 to E.5.8B, when applied in this
subclause (closed loop transmit diversity) are equal to the sum of the
levels at both antennas. They are equally divided between both antennas
according to Table E.5.3: column Note.

### 9.2.3E Closed Loop Diversity Performance Enhanced Performance Requirements Type 3, QPSK/16QAM, Fixed Reference Channel (FRC) H-Set 3

Editor's note: This test is copied from 9.2.3C with the change that only
H-Set3 is tested and that applicability is enhanced performance
requirements type 3 instead of type 1.

#### 9.2.3E.1 Definition and applicability

The receiver closed loop transmit diversity performance of the High
Speed Physical Downlink Shared Channel (HS-DSCH) in multi-path fading
environments are determined by the information bit throughput R.

The requirements and this test apply also for Release 7 and later
releases to all types of UTRA for the FDD UE that support: HSDPA UE
capability categories 7 - 10 and 13 - 14 and the optional enhanced
performance requirements type 3.

The requirements and this test apply also for Release 7 and later
releases to all types of UTRA for the FDD UE that support: HSDPA UE
capability categories 15 - 18.

The requirements and this test apply also for Release 8 and later
releases to all types of UTRA for the FDD UE that support: HSDPA UE
capability categories 7 - 10 and 13 - 14 and the optional enhanced
performance requirements type 3i.

The requirements and this test apply also for Release 8 and later
releases to all types of UTRA for the FDD UE that support HSDPA UE
capability categories 19 - 20.

#### 9.2.3E.2 Minimum requirements

Requirements for a particular UE belonging to certain HS-DSCH category
are determined according to the relevant part of Table 9.2.3A.

The requirements are specified in terms of minimum information bit
throughput R for the DL reference channels H-set 1/2/3 specified in
Annex C.8.1.1, C.8.1.2 and C.8.1.3 respectively, with the addition of
the relevant parameters in Tables 9.2.3E.1 and 9.2.3E.3 plus the
downlink physical channel setup according to table E.5.3.

Using this configuration the throughput shall meet or exceed the minimum
requirements specified in tables 9.2.3E.2 and 9.2.3E.4.

NOTE: Tables 9.2.3E.2 and 9.2.3E.4 are based on core requirements for
enhanced requirement type 1 as explained in Table 9.2.3.

The reference for this requirement is TS 25.101 \[1\] clauses 9.2.3.1
and 9.2.3.2.

#### 9.2.3E.3 Test purpose

To verify the ability of the receiver to receive a predefined test
signal, representing a multi-path fading channel with information bit
throughput R not falling below a specified value. The test stresses the
multi-code reception and channel decoding with incremental redundancy.

#### 9.2.3E.4 Method of test

##### 9.2.3E.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: normal; see clauses G.2.1 and G.2.2.

Frequencies to be tested: mid range; see clause G.2.4.

1\. Connect the SS (Node B Emulator) and faders and AWGN noise sources
to the UE antenna connector as shown in figure A.22 for UEs that support
receive diversity or figure A.12 for UEs that do not support receive
diversity.

2\. Set the node B emulator behaviour according to table 9.2.4. Set the
test parameters for tests 1-3 according to table 9.2.3E.1 or 9.2.3E.3
and levels according to tables 9.2.3E.6 to 9.2.3E.9. The configuration
of the downlink channels is defined in table E.5.3.

3\. The information bit data shall be pseudo random and not repeated
before 10 different information bit payload blocks are processed. (e.g.
Fixed reference Channel Definition H-set 1 (16 QAM): The information bit
payload block is 4664 bits long. Hence the PRBS must be at least 4664 \*
10 bits long ) Use a PRBS from ITU-T O.153 Ref \[27\].

4\. Setup the fading simulators with fading conditions as described in
table D.2.2.1.A and clause D.2.5.

##### 9.2.3E.4.2 Procedure

1\. Set up a HSDPA connection with looping back 12.2kbps RMC according
to the generic HSDPA set-up procedure specified in TS 34.108 \[3\] sub
clause 7.3.6 with the exceptions for information elements listed in
table 9.2.3E.5, with levels according to table E.5.0.

2\. Once the HSDPA connection is setup, change levels according to
Tables E.5.6 to E.5.8B as specified by table E.5.9 and start
transmitting HSDPA Data.

3\. For all relevant propagation conditions, for all relevant Ioc
levels, for all relevant Ec/Ior, for all relevant Îor/Ioc, for all
relevant H-sets in tables 9.2.3E.6 to 9.2.3E.9 count the number of NACK,
ACK and statDTX on the UL HS-DPCCH during the test interval and decide
pass or fail according to Annex F.6.3 tables F.6.3.5.4.1 and
F.6.3.5.4.2. ACK is counted as a pass. NACK and statDTX are counted as a
failure.

#### 9.2.3E.5 Test Requirements

Tables 9.2.3E.6 to 9.2.3E.9 define the primary level settings including
test tolerance and test parameters for all relevant throughput tests.
The pass / fail decision for throughput is done according to Annex
F.6.3.

Tables E.5.6 to E.5.8B define the secondary and subsequently ranked
level settings including test tolerance. As those level settings are not
uniform for the throughput tests in this clause, Table E.5.9 indicates
which levels are applied, when the primary level settings (Ec/Ior and
Ior/Ioc) and propagation conditions (PA3, PB3, VA30, VA 120) vary.

Note that the levels in tables E.5.6 to E.5.8B, when applied in this
subclause (closed loop transmit diversity) are equal to the sum of the
levels at both antennas. They are equally divided between both antennas
according to Table E.5.3: column Note.

### 9.2.4 MIMO Performance

The test case in section 9.2.4A defines the MIMO Performance test for
the Fixed Reference Channel (FRC) H-Set 9.

### 9.2.4A MIMO Performance - Fixed Reference Channel (FRC) H-Set 9

#### 9.2.4A.1 Definition and applicability

The MIMO performance of the High Speed Physical Downlink Shared Channel
(HS-DSCH) in multi-path fading environments is determined by the
information bit throughput R.

The requirements and this test apply to Release 7 and later releases for
all types of UTRA for FDD UE that support HSDPA UE capability categories
15 - 18.

#### 9.2.4A.2 Minimum requirements

The requirements are specified in terms of a minimum information bit
throughput R for the DL reference channels H-Set 9 specified in Annex
C.8.1.9, with the addition of the parameters in Table 9.2.4A.1 and the
downlink physical channel setup according to Table E.5.2. Precoding
weight set restriction shall not be enabled. The primary precoding
vector signalled on the HS-SCCH and applied on the associated HS-DSCH
subframe shall correspond to the preferred primary precoding vector
reported immediately before the start of the HS-SCCH subframe.

The determination of applied precoding vector for single transport block
transmission shall be as follows: the reported preferred primary
precoding vector shall be applied to the primary transport block.

The determination of applied precoding vector for two transport block
transmission shall be as follows: If the CQI reported by the UE
indicates a preference for a single transport block, the preferred
primary precoding vector shall be applied to the primary transport
block. If the CQI reported by the UE indicates a preference for two
transport blocks, and the preferred primary precoding vector corresponds
to the highest reported CQI value, the preferred primary precoding
vector shall be applied to the primary transport block. If the CQI
reported by the UE indicates a preference for two transport blocks, and
the preferred primary precoding vector does not correspond to the
highest reported CQI value, the preferred primary precoding vector shall
be applied to the secondary transport block.

Using this configuration the throughput shall meet or exceed the minimum
requirements specified in Table 9.2.4A.2 with the downlink physical
channel setup in Table E.5.2.

before 10 different information bit payload blocks are processed. (e.g.
Fixed reference Channel Definition H-set 9 dual stream \[tests 1 & 2\]:
The information bit payload block is 17568 bits for the primary block
using 16QAM and 9736 bits for the secondary block using QPSK. Hence the
PRBS must be at least 17568 \* 10 bits long for the primary block and
9736 \* 10 bits for the secondary block. Also. For fixed reference

##### 9.2.4A.4.2 Procedure

1\. Set up a HSDPA with looping back 12.2kbps RMC connection according
to the generic HSDPA set-up procedure specified in TS 34.108 \[3\] sub
clause 7.3.6 with the exceptions for information elements listed in
table 9.2.4A.3 and exceptions in Annex I, with levels according to table
E.5.0.

2\. Once the HSDPA connection is setup, change levels according to
Tables E.5.6 to E.5.8C as specified by table E.5.9 and start
transmitting HSDPA Data.

3\. For all relevant propagation conditions, for all relevant Ioc
levels, for all relevant Ec/Ior, for all relevant Îor/Ioc, for H-set 9
count the number of NACK, ACK and statDTX on the UL HS-DPCCH during the
test interval and, for test 3 and 4, decide pass or fail according to
Annex F.6.3 table F.6.3.5.4.10. ACK is counted as a success. NACK and
statDTX are counted as a failure.

4\. For test 1 and 2 there are 4 possible contributions to the
throughput per TTI.

+----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+
| Primary stream       | ACK on the Primary   | NACK on the Primary  |
|                      | stream               | stream               |
| Secondary stream     |                      |                      |
|                      | (16 QAM)             |                      |
+----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+

| stream (QPSK)        | per TTI              |                      |
+----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+
| NACK on the          | 17568 bit per TTI    | 0 bit per TTI        |
| secondary stream     |                      |                      |
|                      |                      | (also counted in     |
|                      |                      | case of statDTX)     |
+----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+

At the end of the test interval calculate the throughput and relate it
to the nominal throughput. This is the relative throughput RT. Decide
pass or fail according to Annex F.6.3 Table F.6.3.5.4.10

##### 9.2.4A.5 Test Requirements

Tables 9.2.4A.4 and 9.2.4A.5 define the primary level settings including
test tolerance and test parameters for all relevant throughput tests.
The pass / fail decision for throughput is done according to Annex
F.6.3.

Tables E.5.6 to E.5.8C define the secondary and subsequently ranked
level settings including test tolerance. As those level settings are not
uniform for the throughput tests in this clause, Table E.5.9 indicates
which levels are applied, when the primary level settings (Ec/Ior and
Ior/Ioc) and propagation conditions (PA3, VA3) vary.

Note that the levels in tables E.5.6 to E.5.8C, when applied in this
subclause (MIMO performance) are equal to the sum of the levels at both
antennas. They are equally divided between both antennas according to
Table E.5.2: column Note.

### 9.2.4B MIMO Performance - Fixed Reference Channel (FRC) H-Set 11

#### 9.2.4B.1 Definition and applicability

The MIMO performance of the High Speed Physical Downlink Shared Channel
(HS-DSCH) in multi-path fading environments is determined by the
information bit throughput R.

The requirements and this test apply to Release 8 and later releases for
all types of UTRA for FDD UE that support HSDPA UE capability categories
19-20.

#### 9.2.4B.2 Minimum requirements

The requirements are specified in terms of a minimum information bit
throughput R for the DL reference channels H-Set 11 specified in Annex
C.8.1.11, with the addition of the parameters in Table 9.2.4B.1 and the
downlink physical channel setup according to Table E.5.2. Precoding
weight set restriction shall not be enabled.

The primary precoding vector signalled on the HS-SCCH and applied on the
associated HS-DSCH subframe shall correspond to the preferred primary
precoding vector reported immediately before the start of the HS-SCCH
subframe.

The determination of applied precoding vector for two transport block
transmission shall be as follows: If the CQI reported by the UE
indicates a preference for a single transport block, the preferred
primary precoding vector shall be applied to the primary transport
block. If the CQI reported by the UE indicates a preference for two
transport blocks, and the preferred primary precoding vector corresponds
to the highest reported CQI value, the preferred primary precoding
vector shall be applied to the primary transport block. If the CQI
reported by the UE indicates a preference for two transport blocks, and
the preferred primary precoding vector does not correspond to the
highest reported CQI value, the preferred primary precoding vector shall
be applied to the secondary transport block.

Using this configuration the throughput shall meet or exceed the minimum
requirements specified in Table 9.2.4B.2 with the downlink physical
channel setup in Table E.5.2.

The reference for this requirement is TS 25.101 \[1\] clause 9.2.4.2.

#### 9.2.4B.3 Test purpose

To verify the ability of the receiver to receive a predefined test
signal, representing a multi-path fading channel with information bit
throughput R not falling below a specified value. The test stresses the
multi-code reception and channel decoding with incremental redundancy.

#### 9.2.4B.4 Method of test

##### 9.2.4B.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: normal; see clauses G.2.1 and G.2.2.

Frequencies to be tested: mid range; see clause G.2.4.

2.  Connect the SS (Node B Emulator) and faders and AWGN noise sources
    to the UE antenna connectors as shown in figure A.22.

2\. Set the node B emulator behaviour according to table 9.2.4. Set the
test parameters according to table 9.2.4B.1 and levels according to
tables 9.2.4B.4 and 9.2.4B.5. The configuration of the downlink channels
is defined in table E.5.2.

3\. The information bit data shall be pseudo random and not repeated
before 10 different information bit payload blocks are processed. (the
information bit payload block is 26504 bits for the primary block using
64QAM and 17568 bits for the secondary block using 16QAM. Hence the PRBS
must be at least 26504 \* 10 bits long for the primary block and 17568
\* 10 bits for the secondary block.). Use a PRBS from ITU-T O.153 Ref
\[27\].

4\. Setup the fading simulators with fading conditions as described in
tables D.2.2.1A and D.2.2.1C and clause D.2.

##### 9.2.4B.4.2 Procedure

1\. Set up a HSDPA with looping back 12.2kbps RMC connection according
to the generic HSDPA set-up procedure specified in TS 34.108 \[3\] sub
clause 7.3.6 with the exceptions for information elements listed in
table 9.2.4B.3 and exceptions in Annex I, with levels according to table
E.5.0.

2\. Once the HSDPA connection is setup, change levels according to
Tables E.5.6 to E.5.8C as specified by table E.5.9 and start
transmitting HSDPA Data.

3\. For all relevant propagation conditions, for all relevant Ioc
levels, for all relevant Ec/Ior, for all relevant Îor/Ioc, for H-set 11
count the number of NACK, ACK and statDTX on the UL HS-DPCCH during the
test interval. ACK is counted as a success. NACK and statDTX are counted
as a failure.

4\. There are 4 possible contributions to the throughput per TTI.

+----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+
| Primary stream       | ACK on the Primary   | NACK on the Primary  |
|                      | stream               | stream               |

|                      |                      | case of statDTX)     |
+----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+

At the end of the test interval calculate the throughput and relate it
to the nominal throughput. This is the relative throughput RT. Decide
pass or fail according to Annex F.6.3 Table F.6.3.5.4.7

##### 9.2.4B.5 Test Requirements

Tables 9.2.4B.4 and 9.2.4B.5 define the primary level settings including
test tolerance and test parameters. The pass / fail decision for
throughput is done according to Annex F.6.3.

Tables E.5.6 to E.5.8D define the secondary and subsequently ranked
level settings including test tolerance. As those level settings are not
uniform for the throughput tests in this clause, Table E.5.9 indicates
which levels are applied, when the primary level settings (Ec/Ior and
Ior/Ioc) and propagation conditions (PA3, VA3) vary.

Note that the levels in tables E.5.6 to E.5.8D, when applied in this
subclause (MIMO performance) are equal to the sum of the levels at both
antennas. They are equally divided between both antennas according to
Table E.5.2: column Note.

### 9.2.4C MIMO Performance - Fixed Reference Channel (FRC) H-Set 9A

#### 9.2.4C.1 Definition and applicability

The MIMO performance of the High Speed Physical Downlink Shared Channel
(HS-DSCH) in multi-path fading environments is determined by the
information bit throughput R.

The requirements and this test apply to Release 9 and later releases for
all types of UTRA for FDD UE that support HSDPA UE capability categories
25 - 28 but not supporting Dual band operation.

#### 9.2.4C.2 Minimum requirements

The requirements are specified in terms of a minimum information bit
throughput R for the DL reference channels H-Set 9A specified in Annex
C.8.1.9, with the addition of the parameters in Table 9.2.4C.1 and the
downlink physical channel setup according to Table E.5.2. Precoding
weight set restriction shall not be enabled.

The primary precoding vector signalled on the HS-SCCH and applied on the
associated HS-DSCH subframe shall correspond to the preferred primary
precoding vector reported immediately before the start of the HS-SCCH
subframe.

The determination of applied precoding vector for single transport block
transmission shall be as follows: the reported preferred primary
precoding vector shall be applied to the primary transport block.

The determination of applied precoding vector for two transport block
transmission shall be as follows: If the CQI reported by the UE
indicates a preference for a single transport block, the preferred
primary precoding vector shall be applied to the primary transport
block. If the CQI reported by the UE indicates a preference for two
transport blocks, and the preferred primary precoding vector corresponds
to the highest reported CQI value, the preferred primary precoding
vector shall be applied to the primary transport block. If the CQI
reported by the UE indicates a preference for two transport blocks, and
the preferred primary precoding vector does not correspond to the
highest reported CQI value, the preferred primary precoding vector shall
be applied to the secondary transport block.

Using this configuration the throughput shall meet or exceed the minimum
requirements specified in table 9.2.4C.2 with the downlink physical
channel setup in Table E.5.2.

#### 9.2.4C.3 Test purpose

To verify the ability of the receiver to receive a predefined test
signal, representing a multi-path fading channel with information bit
throughput R not falling below a specified value. The test stresses the
multi-code reception and channel decoding with incremental redundancy.

#### 9.2.4C.4 Method of test

##### 9.2.4C.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: normal; see clauses G.2.1 and G.2.2.

Frequencies to be tested: mid range; see clause G.2.4.

1.  Connect the SS (Node B Emulator) and faders and AWGN noise sources
    to the UE antenna connectors as shown in figure A.40.

2.  Set the node B emulator behaviour according to table 9.2.4. Set the
    test parameters for tests 1-4 according to table 9.2.4C.1 and levels
    according to tables 9.2.4C.4 and 9.2.4C.5. The configuration of the
    downlink channels is defined in table E.5.2.

3.  The information bit data shall be pseudo random and not repeated
    before 10 different information bit payload blocks are processed.
    (e.g. Fixed reference Channel Definition H-Set 9A dual stream
    \[tests 1 & 2\]: The information bit payload block is 17568 bits for
    the primary block using 16QAM and 9736 bits for the secondary block
    using QPSK. Hence the PRBS must be at least 17568 \* 10 bits long
    for the primary block and 9736 \* 10 bits for the secondary block.
    Also. For fixed reference Channel Definition H-Set 9A single stream
    \[tests 3 & 4\]: The information bit payload block, there is only
    one payload block size which is 17568 bits using 16QAM, hence the
    PRBS must be at least 17568 \* 10 bits long for the single stream
    case). Use a PRBS from ITU-T O.153 Ref \[27\].

4.  Setup the fading simulators with fading conditions as described in
    tables D.2.2.1A and D.2.2.1C and clause D.2. on each of the serving
    cells.

##### 9.2.4C.4.2 Procedure

1.  Set up a HSDPA with looping back 12.2kbps RMC connection according
    to the generic HSDPA set-up procedure specified in TS 34.108 \[3\]
    sub clause 7.3.13 with the exceptions for information elements
    listed in table 9.2.4C.3 and exceptions in Annex I, with levels
    according to table E.5.0.

2.  Once the HSDPA connection is setup, change levels according to
    Tables E.5.6 to E.5.8B as specified by table E.5.9 and start
    transmitting HSDPA Data on both the serving cells. For secondary
    serving HS-DSCH cell only P-CPICH, HS-PDSCH and HS-SCCH are
    configured.

3.  For all relevant propagation conditions, for all relevant Ioc
    levels, for all relevant Ec/Ior, for all relevant Îor/Ioc, for H-Set
    9A count the number of NACK, ACK and statDTX on the UL HS-DPCCH
    during the test interval and, for test 3 and 4, decide pass or fail
    according to Annex F.6.3 table F.6.3.5.4.9. ACK is counted as a
    success. NACK and statDTX are counted as a failure. Throughput shall
    be measured per cell and compared to requirements in these tables.

4.  For test 1 and 2 there are 4 possible contributions to the
    throughput per TTI.

+----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+
| Primary stream       | ACK on the Primary   | NACK on the Primary  |
|                      | stream               | stream               |
| Secondary stream     |                      |                      |
|                      | (16 QAM)             |                      |
+----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+
| ACK on the secondary | (17568 + 9736) bit   | 9736 bit per TTI     |
| stream (QPSK)        | per TTI              |                      |
+----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+
| NACK on the          | 17568 bit per TTI    | 0 bit per TTI        |
| secondary stream     |                      |                      |
|                      |                      | (also counted in     |
|                      |                      | case of statDTX)     |
+----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+

At the end of the test interval calculate the throughput for each cell
and relate it to the nominal throughput. This is the relative throughput
RT. Decide pass or fail according to Annex F.6.3 Table F.6.3.5.4.10

#### 9.2.4C.5 Test Requirements

Tables 9.2.4C.4 and 9.2.4C.5 define the primary level settings including
test tolerance and test parameters for all relevant throughput tests.
The pass / fail decision for throughput is done according to Annex
F.6.3.

Tables E.5.6 to E.5.8C define the secondary and subsequently ranked
level settings including test tolerance for both the serving cells. As
those level settings are not uniform for the throughput tests in this
clause, Table E.5.9 indicates which levels are applied, when the primary
level settings (Ec/Ior and Ior/Ioc) and propagation conditions (PA3,
VA3) vary.

Note that the levels in tables E.5.6 to E.5.8C, when applied in this
subclause (MIMO performance) are equal to the sum of the levels at both
antennas. They are equally divided between both antennas according to
Table E.5.2: column Note.

### 9.2.4CA MIMO Performance - Fixed Reference Channel (FRC) H-Set 9A for DB DC-HSDPA

#### 9.2.4CA.1 Definition and applicability

The MIMO performance of the High Speed Physical Downlink Shared Channel
(HS-DSCH) in multi-path fading environments is determined by the
information bit throughput R.

The requirements and this test apply to Release 10 and later releases
for all types of UTRA for FDD UE that support DB-DC-HSDPA and HSDPA UE
capability categories 25 - 28.

#### 9.2.4CA.2 Minimum requirements

The requirements are specified in terms of a minimum information bit
throughput R for the DL reference channels H-Set 9A specified in Annex
C.8.1.9, with the addition of the parameters in Table 9.2.4CA.1 and the
downlink physical channel setup according to Table E.5.2. Precoding
weight set restriction shall not be enabled.

The primary precoding vector signalled on the HS-SCCH and applied on the
associated HS-DSCH subframe shall correspond to the preferred primary
precoding vector reported immediately before the start of the HS-SCCH
subframe.

The determination of applied precoding vector for single transport block
transmission shall be as follows: the reported preferred primary
precoding vector shall be applied to the primary transport block.

The determination of applied precoding vector for two transport block
transmission shall be as follows: If the CQI reported by the UE
indicates a preference for a single transport block, the preferred
primary precoding vector shall be applied to the primary transport
block. If the CQI reported by the UE indicates a preference for two
transport blocks, and the preferred primary precoding vector corresponds
to the highest reported CQI value, the preferred primary precoding
vector shall be applied to the primary transport block. If the CQI
reported by the UE indicates a preference for two transport blocks, and
the preferred primary precoding vector does not correspond to the
highest reported CQI value, the preferred primary precoding vector shall
be applied to the secondary transport block.

Using this configuration the throughput shall meet or exceed the minimum
requirements specified in table 9.2.4CA.2 with the downlink physical
channel setup in Table E.5.2.

The reference for this requirement is TS 25.101 \[1\] clause 9.2.4.1.

#### 9.2.4CA.3 Test purpose

To verify the ability of the receiver to receive a predefined test
signal, representing a multi-path fading channel with information bit
throughput R not falling below a specified value. The test stresses the
multi-code reception and channel decoding with incremental redundancy.

#### 9.2.4CA.4 Method of test

##### 9.2.4CA.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: normal; see clauses G.2.1 and G.2.2.

Frequencies to be tested: mid range; see clause G.2.4.

1\. Connect the SS (Node B Emulator) and faders and AWGN noise sources
to the UE antenna connectors as shown in figure A.40.

2\. Set the node B emulator behaviour according to table 9.2.4. Set the
test parameters for tests 1-4 according to Table 9.2.4CA.1 and levels
according to tables 9.2.4CA.4 and 9.2.4CA.5. The primary and secondary
serving cells are set on different bands according to DB-DC-HSDPA
configurations defined in Section 4.2. The configuration of the downlink
channels is defined in table E.5.2.

3\. The information bit data shall be pseudo random and not repeated
before 10 different information bit payload blocks are processed. (e.g.
Fixed reference Channel Definition H-Set 9A dual stream \[tests 1 & 2\]:
The information bit payload block is 17568 bits for the primary block
using 16QAM and 9736 bits for the secondary block using QPSK. Hence the
PRBS must be at least 17568 \* 10 bits long for the primary block and
9736 \* 10 bits for the secondary block. Also for fixed reference
Channel Definition H-Set 9A single stream \[tests 3 & 4\]: The
information bit payload block, there is only one payload block size
which is 17568 bits using 16QAM, hence the PRBS must be at least 17568
\* 10 bits long for the single stream case). Use a PRBS from ITU-T O.153
Ref \[27\].

4\. Setup the fading simulators with fading conditions as described in
tables D.2.2.1A and D.2.2.1C and clause D.2. on each of the serving
cells.

##### 9.2.4CA.4.2 Procedure

1\. Set up a HSDPA with looping back 12.2kbps RMC connection according
to the generic HSDPA set-up procedure specified in TS 34.108 \[3\] sub
clause 7.3.13 with the exceptions for information elements listed in
table 9.2.4CA.3 and exceptions in Annex I, with levels according to
table E.5.0.

2\. Once the HSDPA connection is setup, change levels according to
Tables E.5.6 to E.5.8B as specified by Table E.5.9 and start
transmitting HSDPA Data on both the serving cells. For secondary serving
HS-DSCH cell only P-CPICH, HS-PDSCH and HS-SCCH are configured.

3\. For all relevant propagation conditions, for all relevant Ioc
levels, for all relevant Ec/Ior, for all relevant Îor/Ioc, for H-Set 9A
count the number of NACK, ACK and statDTX on the UL HS-DPCCH during the
test interval and, for test 3 and 4, decide pass or fail according to
Annex F.6.3 table F.6.3.5.4.10. ACK is counted as a success. NACK and
statDTX are counted as a failure. Throughput shall be measured per cell
and compared to requirements in these tables.

4\. For test 1 and 2 there are 4 possible contributions to the
throughput per TTI.

+----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+
| Primary stream       | ACK on the Primary   | NACK on the Primary  |
|                      | stream               | stream               |
| Secondary stream     |                      |                      |
|                      | (16 QAM)             |                      |
+----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+
| ACK on the secondary | (17568 + 9736) bit   | 9736 bit per TTI     |
| stream (QPSK)        | per TTI              |                      |
+----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+
| NACK on the          | 17568 bit per TTI    | 0 bit per TTI        |
| secondary stream     |                      |                      |
|                      |                      | (also counted in     |
|                      |                      | case of statDTX)     |
+----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+

At the end of the test interval calculate the throughput for each cell
and relate it to the nominal throughput. This is the relative throughput
RT. Decide pass or fail according to Annex F.6.3 Table F.6.3.5.4.10

#### 9.2.4CA.5 Test Requirements

Tables 9.2.4CA.4 and 9.2.4CA.5 define the primary level settings
including test tolerance and test parameters for all relevant throughput
tests. The pass / fail decision for throughput is done according to
Annex F.6.3.

Tables E.5.6 to E.5.8C define the secondary and subsequently ranked
level settings including test tolerance for both the serving cells. As
those level settings are not uniform for the throughput tests in this
clause, Table E.5.9 indicates which levels are applied, when the primary
level settings (Ec/Ior and Ior/Ioc) and propagation conditions (PA3,
VA3) vary.

Note that the levels in tables E.5.6 to E.5.8C, when applied in this
subclause (MIMO performance) are equal to the sum of the levels at both
antennas. They are equally divided between both antennas according to
Table E.5.2: column Note.

### 9.2.4D MIMO Performance - Fixed Reference Channel (FRC) H-Set 11A

#### 9.2.4D.1 Definition and applicability

The MIMO performance of the High Speed Physical Downlink Shared Channel
(HS-DSCH) in multi-path fading environments is determined by the
information bit throughput R.

The requirements and this test apply to Release 9 and later releases for
all types of UTRA for FDD UE that support HSDPA UE capability categories
27-28 but not supporting Dual band operation.

#### 9.2.4D.2 Minimum requirements

The requirements are specified in terms of a minimum information bit
throughput R for the DL reference channels H-Set 11A specified in Annex
C.8.1.11, with the addition of the parameters in Table 9.2.4D.1 and the
downlink physical channel setup according to Table E.5.2. Precoding
weight set restriction shall not be enabled.

The primary precoding vector signalled on the HS-SCCH and applied on the
associated HS-DSCH subframe shall correspond to the preferred primary
precoding vector reported immediately before the start of the HS-SCCH
subframe.

The determination of applied precoding vector for two transport block
transmission shall be as follows: If the CQI reported by the UE
indicates a preference for a single transport block, the preferred
primary precoding vector shall be applied to the primary transport
block. If the CQI reported by the UE indicates a preference for two
transport blocks, and the preferred primary precoding vector corresponds
to the highest reported CQI value, the preferred primary precoding
vector shall be applied to the primary transport block. If the CQI
reported by the UE indicates a preference for two transport blocks, and
the preferred primary precoding vector does not correspond to the
highest reported CQI value, the preferred primary precoding vector shall
be applied to the secondary transport block.

The reference for this requirement is TS 25.101 \[1\] clause 9.2.4.2.

#### 9.2.4D.3 Test purpose

To verify the ability of the receiver to receive a predefined test
signal, representing a multi-path fading channel with information bit
throughput R not falling below a specified value. The test stresses the
multi-code reception and channel decoding with incremental redundancy.

#### 9.2.4D.4 Method of test

##### 9.2.4D.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: normal; see clauses G.2.1 and G.2.2.

Frequencies to be tested: mid range; see clause G.2.4.

1.  Connect the SS (Node B Emulator) and faders and AWGN noise sources
    to the UE antenna connectors as shown in figure A.40.

2.  Set the node B emulator behaviour according to table 9.2.4. Set the
    test parameters according to table 9.2.4D.1 and levels according to
    tables 9.2.4D.4 and 9.2.4D.5. The configuration of the downlink
    channels is defined in table E.5.2.

3.  The information bit data shall be pseudo random and not repeated
    before 10 different information bit payload blocks are processed.
    (the information bit payload block is 26504 bits for the primary
    block using 64QAM and 17568 bits for the secondary block using
    16QAM. Hence the PRBS must be at least 26504 \* 10 bits long for the
    primary block and 17568 \* 10 bits for the secondary block.). Use a
    PRBS from ITU-T O.153 Ref \[27\].

4.  Setup the fading simulators with fading conditions as described in
    tables D.2.2.1A and clause D.2 on both the serving cells.

##### 9.2.4D.4.2 Procedure

1.  Set up a HSDPA with looping back 12.2kbps RMC connection according
    to the generic HSDPA set-up procedure specified in TS 34.108 \[3\]
    sub clause 7.3.13 with the exceptions for information elements
    listed in table 9.2.4D.3 and exceptions in Annex I, with levels
    according to table E.5.0.

2.  Once the HSDPA connection is setup, change levels according to
    Tables E.5.6 to E.5.8C as specified by Table E.5.9 and start
    transmitting HSDPA Data on both the serving cells. For secondary
    serving HS-DSCH cell only P-CPICH, HS-PDSCH and HS-SCCH are
    configured.

3.  For all relevant propagation conditions, for all relevant Ioc
    levels, for all relevant Ec/Ior, for all relevant Îor/Ioc, for H-Set
    11A count the number of NACK, ACK and statDTX on the UL HS-DPCCH
    during the test interval. ACK is counted as a success. NACK and
    statDTX are counted as a failure. Throughput shall be measured per
    cell and compared to requirements in these tables.

4.  There are 4 possible contributions to the throughput per TTI.

+----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+
| Primary stream       | ACK on the Primary   | NACK on the Primary  |
|                      | stream               | stream               |
| Secondary stream     |                      |                      |
|                      | (64QAM)              |                      |
+----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+
| ACK on the secondary | (26504 + 17568) bit  | 17568 bit per TTI    |
| stream (16QAM)       | per TTI              |                      |
+----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+
| NACK on the          | 26504 bit per TTI    | 0 bit per TTI        |
| secondary stream     |                      |                      |
|                      |                      | (also counted in     |
|                      |                      | case of statDTX)     |
+----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+

At the end of the test interval calculate the throughput for each cell
and relate it to the nominal throughput. This is the relative throughput
RT. Decide pass or fail according to Annex F.6.3 Table F.6.3.5.4.11

#### 9.2.4D.5 Test Requirements

Tables 9.2.4D.4 and 9.2.4D.5 define the primary level settings including
test tolerance and test parameters. The pass / fail decision for
throughput is done according to Annex F.6.3.

Tables E.5.6 to E.5.8D define the secondary and subsequently ranked
level settings including test tolerance for both the serving cells. As
those level settings are not uniform for the throughput tests in this
clause, Table E.5.9 indicates which levels are applied, when the primary
level settings (Ec/Ior and Ior/Ioc) and propagation conditions (PA3,
VA3) vary.

Note that the levels in tables E.5.6 to E.5.8D, when applied in this
subclause (MIMO performance) are equal to the sum of the levels at both
antennas. They are equally divided between both antennas according to
Table E.5.2: column Note.

### 9.2.4DA MIMO Performance - Fixed Reference Channel (FRC) H-Set 11A for DB DC-HSDPA

#### 9.2.4DA.1 Definition and applicability

The MIMO performance of the High Speed Physical Downlink Shared Channel
(HS-DSCH) in multi-path fading environments is determined by the
information bit throughput R.

The requirements and this test apply to Release 10 and later releases
for all types of UTRA for FDD UE that support DB-DC-HSDPA and HSDPA UE
capability categories 27-28.

#### 9.2.4DA.2 Minimum requirements

The requirements are specified in terms of a minimum information bit
throughput R for the DL reference channels H-Set 11A specified in Annex
C.8.1.11, with the addition of the parameters in Table 9.2.4DA.1 and the
downlink physical channel setup according to Table E.5.2. Precoding
weight set restriction shall not be enabled.

The primary precoding vector signalled on the HS-SCCH and applied on the
associated HS-DSCH subframe shall correspond to the preferred primary
precoding vector reported immediately before the start of the HS-SCCH
subframe.

The determination of applied precoding vector for two transport block
transmission shall be as follows: If the CQI reported by the UE
indicates a preference for a single transport block, the preferred
primary precoding vector shall be applied to the primary transport
block. If the CQI reported by the UE indicates a preference for two
transport blocks, and the preferred primary precoding vector corresponds
to the highest reported CQI value, the preferred primary precoding
vector shall be applied to the primary transport block. If the CQI
reported by the UE indicates a preference for two transport blocks, and
the preferred primary precoding vector does not correspond to the
highest reported CQI value, the preferred primary precoding vector shall
be applied to the secondary transport block.

Using this configuration the throughput shall meet or exceed the minimum
requirements specified in Table 9.2.4DA.2 with the downlink physical
channel setup in Table E.5.2.

The reference for this requirement is TS 25.101 \[1\] clause 9.2.4.2.

#### 9.2.4DA.3 Test purpose

To verify the ability of the receiver to receive a predefined test
signal, representing a multi-path fading channel with information bit
throughput R not falling below a specified value. The test stresses the
multi-code reception and channel decoding with incremental redundancy.

#### 9.2.4DA.4 Method of test

##### 9.2.4DA.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: normal; see clauses G.2.1 and G.2.2.

Frequencies to be tested: mid range; see clause G.2.4.

1\. Connect the SS (Node B Emulator) and faders and AWGN noise sources
to the UE antenna connectors as shown in figure A.40.

2\. Set the node B emulator behaviour according to table 9.2.4. Set the
test parameters according to Table 9.2.4DA.1 and levels according to
tables 9.2.4DA.4 and 9.2.4DA.5. The primary and secondary serving cells
are set on different bands according to DB-DC-HSDPA configurations
defined in Section 4.2. The configuration of the downlink channels is
defined in table E.5.2.

3\. The information bit data shall be pseudo random and not repeated
before 10 different information bit payload blocks are processed. (the
information bit payload block is 26504 bits for the primary block using
64QAM and 17568 bits for the secondary block using 16QAM. Hence the PRBS
must be at least 26504 \* 10 bits long for the primary block and 17568
\* 10 bits for the secondary block.). Use a PRBS from ITU-T O.153 Ref
\[27\].

4\. Setup the fading simulators with fading conditions as described in
tables D.2.2.1A and clause D.2 on both the serving cells.

##### 9.2.4DA.4.2 Procedure

1\. Set up a HSDPA with looping back 12.2kbps RMC connection according
to the generic HSDPA set-up procedure specified in TS 34.108 \[3\] sub
clause 7.3.13 with the exceptions for information elements listed in
table 9.2.4DA.3 and exceptions in Annex I, with levels according to
table E.5.0.

2\. Once the HSDPA connection is setup, change levels according to
Tables E.5.6 to E.5.8C as specified by Table E.5.9 and start
transmitting HSDPA Data on both the serving cells. For secondary serving
HS-DSCH cell only P-CPICH, HS-PDSCH and HS-SCCH are configured.

3\. For all relevant propagation conditions, for all relevant Ioc
levels, for all relevant Ec/Ior, for all relevant Îor/Ioc, for H-Set 11A
count the number of NACK, ACK and statDTX on the UL HS-DPCCH during the
test interval. ACK is counted as a success. NACK and statDTX are counted
as a failure. Throughput shall be measured per cell and compared to
requirements in these tables.

4\. There are 4 possible contributions to the throughput per TTI.

+----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+
| Primary stream       | ACK on the Primary   | NACK on the Primary  |
|                      | stream               | stream               |
| Secondary stream     |                      |                      |
|                      | (64QAM)              |                      |
+----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+
| ACK on the secondary | (26504 + 17568) bit  | 17568 bit per TTI    |
| stream (16QAM)       | per TTI              |                      |
+----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+
| NACK on the          | 26504 bit per TTI    | 0 bit per TTI        |
| secondary stream     |                      |                      |
|                      |                      | (also counted in     |
|                      |                      | case of statDTX)     |
+----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+

At the end of the test interval calculate the throughput for each cell
and relate it to the nominal throughput. This is the relative throughput
RT. Decide pass or fail according to Annex F.6.3 Table F.6.3.5.4.11

#### 9.2.4DA.5 Test Requirements

Tables 9.2.4DA.4 and 9.2.4DA.5 define the primary level settings
including test tolerance and test parameters. The pass / fail decision
for throughput is done according to Annex F.6.3.

Tables E.5.6 to E.5.8D define the secondary and subsequently ranked
level settings including test tolerance for both the serving cells. As
those level settings are not uniform for the throughput tests in this
clause, Table E.5.9 indicates which levels are applied, when the primary
level settings (Ec/Ior and Ior/Ioc) and propagation conditions (PA3,
VA3) vary.

Note that the levels in tables E.5.6 to E.5.8D, when applied in this
subclause (MIMO performance) are equal to the sum of the levels at both
antennas. They are equally divided between both antennas according to
Table E.5.2: column Note.

### 9.2.4E MIMO Performance - Fixed Reference Channel (FRC) H-Set 9 Asymmetric CPICHs

#### 9.2.4E.1 Definition and applicability

The MIMO performance of the High Speed Physical Downlink Shared Channel
(HS-DSCH) in multi-path fading environments is determined by the
information bit throughput R.

The requirements and this test apply to Release 10 and later releases
for all types of UTRA for FDD UE that support HSDPA UE capability
categories 15 - 18.

NOTE: This test case can be optionally tested for Rel-7 and onward UE's
supporting MIMO feature.

#### 9.2.4E.2 Minimum requirements

The requirements are specified in terms of a minimum information bit
throughput R for the DL reference channels H-Set 9A specified in Annex
C.8.1.9, with the addition of the parameters in Table 9.2.4E.1 and the
downlink physical channel setup according to Table E.5.4D. Precoding
weight set restriction shall not be enabled.

The primary precoding vector signalled on the HS-SCCH and applied on the
associated HS-DSCH subframe shall correspond to the preferred primary
precoding vector reported immediately before the start of the HS-SCCH
subframe.

The determination of applied precoding vector for single transport block
transmission shall be as follows: the reported preferred primary
precoding vector shall be applied to the primary transport block.

The determination of applied precoding vector for two transport block
transmission shall be as follows: If the CQI reported by the UE
indicates a preference for a single transport block, the preferred
primary precoding vector shall be applied to the primary transport
block. If the CQI reported by the UE indicates a preference for two
transport blocks, and the preferred primary precoding vector corresponds
to the highest reported CQI value, the preferred primary precoding
vector shall be applied to the primary transport block. If the CQI
reported by the UE indicates a preference for two transport blocks, and
the preferred primary precoding vector does not correspond to the
highest reported CQI value, the preferred primary precoding vector shall
be applied to the secondary transport block.

Using this configuration the throughput shall meet or exceed the minimum
requirements specified in Table 9.2.4E.2 with the downlink physical
channel setup in Table E.5.4D.

The reference for this requirement is TS 25.101 \[1\] clause 9.2.4.1.

#### 9.2.4E.3 Test purpose

To verify the ability of the receiver to receive a predefined test
signal, representing a multi-path fading channel with information bit
throughput R not falling below a specified value. The test stresses the
multi-code reception and channel decoding with incremental redundancy.

#### 9.2.4E.4 Method of test

##### 9.2.4E.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: normal; see clauses G.2.1 and G.2.2.

Frequencies to be tested: mid range; see clause G.2.4.

1.  Connect the SS (Node B Emulator) and faders and AWGN noise sources
    to the UE antenna connectors as shown in figure A.22.

2\. Set the node B emulator behaviour according to table 9.2.4. Set the
test parameters for tests 1-4 according to Table 9.2.4E.1 and levels
according to tables 9.2.4E.4 and 9.2.4E.5. The configuration of the
downlink channels is defined in table E.5.4D.

3\. The information bit data shall be pseudo random and not repeated
before 10 different information bit payload blocks are processed. (e.g.
Fixed reference Channel Definition H-set 9 dual stream \[tests 1 & 2\]:
The information bit payload block is 17568 bits for the primary block
using 16QAM and 9736 bits for the secondary block using QPSK. Hence the
PRBS must be at least 17568 \* 10 bits long for the primary block and
9736 \* 10 bits for the secondary block. Also. For fixed reference
Channel Definition H-set 9 single stream \[tests 3 & 4\]: The
information bit payload block, there is only one payload block size
which is 17568 bits using 16QAM, hence the PRBS must be at least 17568
\* 10 bits long for the single stream case). Use a PRBS from ITU-T O.153
Ref \[27\].

4\. Setup the fading simulators with fading conditions as described in
tables D.2.2.1A and D.2.2.1C and clause D.2.

##### 9.2.4E.4.2 Procedure

1\. Set up a HSDPA with looping back 12.2kbps RMC connection according
to the generic HSDPA set-up procedure specified in TS 34.108 \[3\] sub
clause 7.3.6 with the exceptions for information elements listed in
table 9.2.4E.3 and exceptions in Annex I, with levels according to table
E.5.0.

2\. Once the HSDPA connection is setup, change levels according to
Tables E.5.6 to E.5.8C as specified by Table E.5.9. In addition, set the
power offset for S-CPICH for MIMO to -3dB and start transmitting HSDPA
Data.

3\. For all relevant propagation conditions, for all relevant Ioc
levels, for all relevant Ec/Ior, for all relevant Îor/Ioc, for H-set 9
count the number of NACK, ACK and statDTX on the UL HS-DPCCH during the
test interval and, for test 3 and 4, decide pass or fail according to
Annex F.6.3 table F.6.3.5.4.10. ACK is counted as a success. NACK and
statDTX are counted as a failure.

4\. For test 1 and 2 there are 4 possible contributions to the
throughput per TTI.

+----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+
| Primary stream       | ACK on the Primary   | NACK on the Primary  |
|                      | stream               | stream               |
| Secondary stream     |                      |                      |
|                      | (16 QAM)             |                      |
+----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+
| ACK on the secondary | (17568 + 9736) bit   | 9736 bit per TTI     |
| stream (QPSK)        | per TTI              |                      |
+----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+
| NACK on the          | 17568 bit per TTI    | 0 bit per TTI        |
| secondary stream     |                      |                      |
|                      |                      | (also counted in     |
|                      |                      | case of statDTX)     |
+----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+

At the end of the test interval calculate the throughput and relate it
to the nominal throughput. This is the relative throughput RT. Decide
pass or fail according to Annex F.6.3 Table F.6.3.5.4.10

##### 9.2.4E.5 Test Requirements

Tables 9.2.4E.4 and 9.2.4E.5 define the primary level settings including
test tolerance and test parameters for all relevant throughput tests.
The pass / fail decision for throughput is done according to Annex
F.6.3.

Tables E.5.6 to E.5.8C define the secondary and subsequently ranked
level settings including test tolerance. As those level settings are not
uniform for the throughput tests in this clause, Table E.5.9 indicates
which levels are applied, when the primary level settings (Ec/Ior and
Ior/Ioc) and propagation conditions (PA3, VA3) vary.

### 9.2.4F MIMO Performance - Fixed Reference Channel (FRC) H-Set 11 Asymmetric CPICHs

#### 9.2.4F.1 Definition and applicability

The MIMO performance of the High Speed Physical Downlink Shared Channel
(HS-DSCH) in multi-path fading environments is determined by the
information bit throughput R.

The requirements and this test apply to Release 10 and later releases
for all types of UTRA for FDD UE that support HSDPA UE capability
categories 19-20.

NOTE: This test case can be optionally tested for Rel-8 and onward UE's
supporting MIMO feature.

#### 9.2.4F.2 Minimum requirements

The requirements are specified in terms of a minimum information bit
throughput R for the DL reference channels H-Set 11 specified in Annex
C.8.1.11, with the addition of the parameters in Table 9.2.4F.1 and the
downlink physical channel setup according to Table E.5.4D. Precoding
weight set restriction shall not be enabled.

The primary precoding vector signalled on the HS-SCCH and applied on the
associated HS-DSCH subframe shall correspond to the preferred primary
precoding vector reported immediately before the start of the HS-SCCH
subframe.

The determination of applied precoding vector for two transport block
transmission shall be as follows: If the CQI reported by the UE
indicates a preference for a single transport block, the preferred
primary precoding vector shall be applied to the primary transport
block. If the CQI reported by the UE indicates a preference for two
transport blocks, and the preferred primary precoding vector corresponds
to the highest reported CQI value, the preferred primary precoding
vector shall be applied to the primary transport block. If the CQI
reported by the UE indicates a preference for two transport blocks, and
the preferred primary precoding vector does not correspond to the
highest reported CQI value, the preferred primary precoding vector shall
be applied to the secondary transport block.

Using this configuration the throughput shall meet or exceed the minimum
requirements specified in Table 9.2.4F.2 with the downlink physical
channel setup in Table E.5.4D.

The reference for this requirement is TS 25.101 \[1\] clause 9.2.4.2.

#### 9.2.4F.3 Test purpose

To verify the ability of the receiver to receive a predefined test
signal, representing a multi-path fading channel with information bit
throughput R not falling below a specified value. The test stresses the
multi-code reception and channel decoding with incremental redundancy.

#### 9.2.4F.4 Method of test

##### 9.2.4F.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: normal; see clauses G.2.1 and G.2.2.

Frequencies to be tested: mid range; see clause G.2.4.

1.  Connect the SS (Node B Emulator) and faders and AWGN noise sources
    to the UE antenna connectors as shown in figure A.22.

2\. Set the node B emulator behaviour according to table 9.2.4. Set the
test parameters according to Table 9.2.4F.1 and levels according to
tables 9.2.4F.4 and 9.2.4F.5. The configuration of the downlink channels
is defined in table E.5.4D.

3\. The information bit data shall be pseudo random and not repeated
before 10 different information bit payload blocks are processed. (the
information bit payload block is 26504 bits for the primary block using
64QAM and 17568 bits for the secondary block using 16QAM. Hence the PRBS
must be at least 26504 \* 10 bits long for the primary block and 17568
\* 10 bits for the secondary block.). Use a PRBS from ITU-T O.153 Ref
\[27\].

4\. Setup the fading simulators with fading conditions as described in
tables D.2.2.1A and D.2.2.1C and clause D.2.

##### 9.2.4F.4.2 Procedure

1\. Set up a HSDPA with looping back 12.2kbps RMC connection according
to the generic HSDPA set-up procedure specified in TS 34.108 \[3\] sub
clause 7.3.6 with the exceptions for information elements listed in
table 9.2.4F.3 and exceptions in Annex I, with levels according to table
E.5.0.

2\. Once the HSDPA connection is setup, change levels according to
Tables E.5.6 to E.5.8C as specified by Table E.5.9. In addition, set the
power offset for S-CPICH for MIMO to -3dB and start transmitting HSDPA
Data.

3\. For all relevant propagation conditions, for all relevant Ioc
levels, for all relevant Ec/Ior, for all relevant Îor/Ioc, for H-set 11
count the number of NACK, ACK and statDTX on the UL HS-DPCCH during the
test interval. ACK is counted as a success. NACK and statDTX are counted
as a failure.

4\. There are 4 possible contributions to the throughput per TTI.

+----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+
| Primary stream       | ACK on the Primary   | NACK on the Primary  |
|                      | stream               | stream               |
| Secondary stream     |                      |                      |
|                      | (64QAM)              |                      |
+----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+
| ACK on the secondary | (26504 + 17568) bit  | 17568 bit per TTI    |
| stream (16QAM)       | per TTI              |                      |
+----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+
| NACK on the          | 26504 bit per TTI    | 0 bit per TTI        |
| secondary stream     |                      |                      |
|                      |                      | (also counted in     |
|                      |                      | case of statDTX)     |
+----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+

At the end of the test interval calculate the throughput and relate it
to the nominal throughput. This is the relative throughput RT. Decide
pass or fail according to Annex F.6.3 Table F.6.3.5.4.7

##### 9.2.4F.5 Test Requirements

Tables 9.2.4F.4 and 9.2.4F.5 define the primary level settings including
test tolerance and test parameters. The pass / fail decision for
throughput is done according to Annex F.6.3.

Tables E.5.6 to E.5.8D define the secondary and subsequently ranked
level settings including test tolerance. As those level settings are not
uniform for the throughput tests in this clause, Table E.5.9 indicates
which levels are applied, when the primary level settings (Ec/Ior and
Ior/Ioc) and propagation conditions (PA3, VA3) vary.

### 9.2.4G MIMO Performance - Fixed Reference Channel (FRC) H-Set 9A Asymmetric CPICHs

#### 9.2.4G.1 Definition and applicability

The MIMO performance of the High Speed Physical Downlink Shared Channel
(HS-DSCH) in multi-path fading environments is determined by the
information bit throughput R.

The requirements and this test apply to Release 10 and later releases
for all types of UTRA for FDD UE that support HSDPA UE capability
categories 25 - 28.

NOTE: This test case can be optionally tested for Rel-9 and onward UE's
supporting MIMO feature.

#### 9.2.4G.2 Minimum requirements

The requirements are specified in terms of a minimum information bit
throughput R for the DL reference channels H-Set 9A specified in Annex
C.8.1.9, with the addition of the parameters in Table 9.2.4G.1 and the
downlink physical channel setup according to Table E.5.4D. Precoding
weight set restriction shall not be enabled.

The primary precoding vector signalled on the HS-SCCH and applied on the
associated HS-DSCH subframe shall correspond to the preferred primary
precoding vector reported immediately before the start of the HS-SCCH
subframe.

The determination of applied precoding vector for single transport block
transmission shall be as follows: the reported preferred primary
precoding vector shall be applied to the primary transport block.

The determination of applied precoding vector for two transport block
transmission shall be as follows: If the CQI reported by the UE
indicates a preference for a single transport block, the preferred
primary precoding vector shall be applied to the primary transport
block. If the CQI reported by the UE indicates a preference for two
transport blocks, and the preferred primary precoding vector corresponds
to the highest reported CQI value, the preferred primary precoding
vector shall be applied to the primary transport block. If the CQI
reported by the UE indicates a preference for two transport blocks, and
the preferred primary precoding vector does not correspond to the
highest reported CQI value, the preferred primary precoding vector shall
be applied to the secondary transport block.

Using this configuration the throughput shall meet or exceed the minimum
requirements specified in table 9.2.4G.2 with the downlink physical
channel setup in Table E.5.4D.

The reference for this requirement is TS 25.101 \[1\] clause 9.2.4.1.

#### 9.2.4G.3 Test purpose

To verify the ability of the receiver to receive a predefined test
signal, representing a multi-path fading channel with information bit
throughput R not falling below a specified value. The test stresses the
multi-code reception and channel decoding with incremental redundancy.

#### 9.2.4G.4 Method of test

##### 9.2.4G.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: normal; see clauses G.2.1 and G.2.2.

Frequencies to be tested: mid range; see clause G.2.4.

1.  Connect the SS (Node B Emulator) and faders and AWGN noise sources
    to the UE antenna connectors as shown in figure A.40.

2.  Set the node B emulator behaviour according to table 9.2.4. Set the
    test parameters for tests 1-4 according to table T.2.4G.1 and levels
    according to tables 9.2.4G.4 and 9.2.4G.5. The configuration of the
    downlink channels is defined in table E.5.4D.

3.  The information bit data shall be pseudo random and not repeated
    before 10 different information bit payload blocks are processed.
    (e.g. Fixed reference Channel Definition H-Set 9A dual stream
    \[tests 1 & 2\]: The information bit payload block is 17568 bits for
    the primary block using 16QAM and 9736 bits for the secondary block
    using QPSK. Hence the PRBS must be at least 17568 \* 10 bits long
    for the primary block and 9736 \* 10 bits for the secondary block.
    Also. For fixed reference Channel Definition H-Set 9A single stream
    \[tests 3 & 4\]: The information bit payload block, there is only
    one payload block size which is 17568 bits using 16QAM, hence the
    PRBS must be at least 17568 \* 10 bits long for the single stream
    case). Use a PRBS from ITU-T O.153 Ref \[27\].

4.  Setup the fading simulators with fading conditions as described in
    tables D.2.2.1A and D.2.2.1C and clause D.2. on each of the serving
    cells.

##### 9.2.4G.4.2 Procedure

1.  Set up a HSDPA with looping back 12.2kbps RMC connection according
    to the generic HSDPA set-up procedure specified in TS 34.108 \[3\]
    sub clause 7.3.13 with the exceptions for information elements
    listed in table 9.2.4G.3 and exceptions in Annex I, with levels
    according to table E.5.0.

2.  Once the HSDPA connection is setup, change levels according to
    Tables E.5.6 to E.5.8B as specified by Table E.5.9. In addition, set
    the power offset for S-CPICH for MIMO to -3dB and start transmitting
    HSDPA Data on both the serving cells. For secondary serving HS-DSCH
    cell only P-CPICH, HS-PDSCH and HS-SCCH are configured.

3.  For all relevant propagation conditions, for all relevant Ioc
    levels, for all relevant Ec/Ior, for all relevant Îor/Ioc, for H-Set
    9A count the number of NACK, ACK and statDTX on the UL HS-DPCCH
    during the test interval and, for test 3 and 4, decide pass or fail
    according to Annex F.6.3 table F.6.3.5.4.9. ACK is counted as a
    success. NACK and statDTX are counted as a failure. Throughput shall
    be measured per cell and compared to requirements in these tables.

4.  For test 1 and 2 there are 4 possible contributions to the
    throughput per TTI.

+----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+
| Primary stream       | ACK on the Primary   | NACK on the Primary  |
|                      | stream               | stream               |
| Secondary stream     |                      |                      |
|                      | (16 QAM)             |                      |
+----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+
| ACK on the secondary | (17568 + 9736) bit   | 9736 bit per TTI     |
| stream (QPSK)        | per TTI              |                      |
+----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+
| NACK on the          | 17568 bit per TTI    | 0 bit per TTI        |
| secondary stream     |                      |                      |
|                      |                      | (also counted in     |
|                      |                      | case of statDTX)     |
+----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+

At the end of the test interval calculate the throughput for each cell
and relate it to the nominal throughput. This is the relative throughput
RT. Decide pass or fail according to Annex F.6.3 Table F.6.3.5.4.10

#### 9.2.4G.5 Test Requirements

Tables 9.2.4G.4 and 9.2.4G.5 define the primary level settings including
test tolerance and test parameters for all relevant throughput tests.
The pass / fail decision for throughput is done according to Annex
F.6.3.

Tables E.5.6 to E.5.8C define the secondary and subsequently ranked
level settings including test tolerance for both the serving cells. As
those level settings are not uniform for the throughput tests in this
clause, Table E.5.9 indicates which levels are applied, when the primary
level settings (Ec/Ior and Ior/Ioc) and propagation conditions (PA3,
VA3) vary.

### 9.2.4H MIMO Performance - Fixed Reference Channel (FRC) H-Set 11A Asymmetric CPICHs

Editor\'s note: This Test case is not complete. Message contents and
distribution of P-CPICH and S-CPICH powers need clarification.

#### 9.2.4H.1 Definition and applicability

The MIMO performance of the High Speed Physical Downlink Shared Channel
(HS-DSCH) in multi-path fading environments is determined by the
information bit throughput R.

The requirements and this test apply to Release 10 and later releases
for all types of UTRA for FDD UE that support HSDPA UE capability
categories 27-28.

NOTE: This test case can be optionally tested for Rel-9 and onward UE's
supporting MIMO feature.

#### 9.2.4H.2 Minimum requirements

The requirements are specified in terms of a minimum information bit
throughput R for the DL reference channels H-Set 11A specified in Annex
C.8.1.11, with the addition of the parameters in Table 9.2.4H.1 and the
downlink physical channel setup according to Table E.5.4D. Precoding
weight set restriction shall not be enabled.

The primary precoding vector signalled on the HS-SCCH and applied on the
associated HS-DSCH subframe shall correspond to the preferred primary
precoding vector reported immediately before the start of the HS-SCCH
subframe.

The determination of applied precoding vector for two transport block
transmission shall be as follows: If the CQI reported by the UE
indicates a preference for a single transport block, the preferred
primary precoding vector shall be applied to the primary transport
block. If the CQI reported by the UE indicates a preference for two
transport blocks, and the preferred primary precoding vector corresponds
to the highest reported CQI value, the preferred primary precoding
vector shall be applied to the primary transport block. If the CQI
reported by the UE indicates a preference for two transport blocks, and
the preferred primary precoding vector does not correspond to the
highest reported CQI value, the preferred primary precoding vector shall
be applied to the secondary transport block.

Using this configuration the throughput shall meet or exceed the minimum
requirements specified in Table 9.2.4H.2 with the downlink physical
channel setup in Table E.5.4D.

The reference for this requirement is TS 25.101 \[1\] clause 9.2.4.2.

#### 9.2.4H.3 Test purpose

To verify the ability of the receiver to receive a predefined test
signal, representing a multi-path fading channel with information bit
throughput R not falling below a specified value. The test stresses the
multi-code reception and channel decoding with incremental redundancy.

#### 9.2.4H.4 Method of test

##### 9.2.4H.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: normal; see clauses G.2.1 and G.2.2.

Frequencies to be tested: mid range; see clause G.2.4.

1.  Connect the SS (Node B Emulator) and faders and AWGN noise sources
    to the UE antenna connectors as shown in figure A.40.

2.  Set the node B emulator behaviour according to table 9.2.4. Set the
    test parameters according to Table 9.2.4H.1 and levels according to
    tables 9.2.4H.4 and 9.2.4H.5. The configuration of the downlink
    channels is defined in table E.5.4D.

3.  The information bit data shall be pseudo random and not repeated
    before 10 different information bit payload blocks are processed.
    (the information bit payload block is 26504 bits for the primary
    block using 64QAM and 17568 bits for the secondary block using
    16QAM. Hence the PRBS must be at least 26504 \* 10 bits long for the
    primary block and 17568 \* 10 bits for the secondary block.). Use a
    PRBS from ITU-T O.153 Ref \[27\].

4.  Setup the fading simulators with fading conditions as described in
    tables D.2.2.1A and clause D.2 on both the serving cells.

##### 9.2.4H.4.2 Procedure

1.  Set up a HSDPA with looping back 12.2kbps RMC connection according
    to the generic HSDPA set-up procedure specified in TS 34.108 \[3\]
    sub clause 7.3.13 with the exceptions for information elements
    listed in table 9.2.4H.3 and exceptions in Annex I, with levels
    according to table E.5.0.

2.  Once the HSDPA connection is setup, change levels according to
    Tables E.5.6 to E.5.8C as specified by Table E.5.9. In addition, set
    the power offset for S-CPICH for MIMO to -3dB and start transmitting
    HSDPA Data on both the serving cells. For secondary serving HS-DSCH
    cell only P-CPICH, HS-PDSCH and HS-SCCH are configured.

3.  For all relevant propagation conditions, for all relevant Ioc
    levels, for all relevant Ec/Ior, for all relevant Îor/Ioc, for H-Set
    11A count the number of NACK, ACK and statDTX on the UL HS-DPCCH
    during the test interval. ACK is counted as a success. NACK and
    statDTX are counted as a failure. Throughput shall be measured per
    cell and compared to requirements in these tables.

4.  There are 4 possible contributions to the throughput per TTI.

+----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+
| Primary stream       | ACK on the Primary   | NACK on the Primary  |
|                      | stream               | stream               |
| Secondary stream     |                      |                      |
|                      | (64QAM)              |                      |
+----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+
| ACK on the secondary | (26504 + 17568) bit  | 17568 bit per TTI    |
| stream (16QAM)       | per TTI              |                      |
+----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+
| NACK on the          | 26504 bit per TTI    | 0 bit per TTI        |
| secondary stream     |                      |                      |
|                      |                      | (also counted in     |
|                      |                      | case of statDTX)     |
+----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+

At the end of the test interval calculate the throughput for each cell
and relate it to the nominal throughput. This is the relative throughput
RT. Decide pass or fail according to Annex F.6.3 Table F.6.3.5.4.11

#### 9.2.4H.5 Test Requirements

Tables 9.2.4H.4 and 9.2.4H.5 define the primary level settings including
test tolerance and test parameters. The pass / fail decision for
throughput is done according to Annex F.6.3.

Tables E.5.6 to E.5.8D define the secondary and subsequently ranked
level settings including test tolerance for both the serving cells. As
those level settings are not uniform for the throughput tests in this
clause, Table E.5.9 indicates which levels are applied, when the primary
level settings (Ec/Ior and Ior/Ioc) and propagation conditions (PA3,
VA3) vary.

9.3 Reporting of Channel Quality Indicator
------------------------------------------

The propagation conditions for this subclause are defined in table
D.2.2.1B for non-MIMO operation under fading conditions, in subclause
D.2.9.1 for MIMO operation under single stream conditions, and in
subclause D.2.9.2 for MIMO operation under dual stream conditions.

For the cases in this subclause where CQI reporting is evaluated under
fading conditions or under MIMO single/dual stream conditions it is
expected that the UE will not always detect the HS-SCCH, resulting in a
DTX for the uplink ACK/NACK transmission. The downlink configuration for
evaluating CQI performance does not use retransmission. Therefore any
BLER calculations must exclude any packets where the UE may have
attempted to combine data from more than one transmission due to having
missed one or more new data indicators or initial transmissions in MIMO
operation from lost HS-SCCH transmissions.

The implication of this situation is covered in the procedure for each
test.

### 9.3.1 Single Link Performance - AWGN Propagation Conditions

#### 9.3.1.1 Definition and applicability

The reporting accuracy of channel quality indicator (CQI) under AWGN
environments is determined by the reporting variance and the BLER
performance using the transport format indicated by the reported CQI
median.

The requirements and this test apply to Release 5 for all types of UTRA
for the FDD UE that support HSDPA UE capability categories 1 - 8, 11 and
12.

The requirements and this test apply to Release 6 and later releases for
all types of UTRA for the FDD UE that support HSDPA UE capability
categories 1 to 12.The requirements and this test apply to Release 7 and
later releases for all types of UTRA for the FDD UE that support HSDPA
UE capability categories 13 to 20.

#### 9.3.1.2 Minimum requirements

For the parameters specified in Table 9.3.1.1, and using the downlink
physical channels specified in table E.5.1 for HSDPA categories 1-8, 11
and 12 or in Table E.5.1A for other HSDPA categories the reported CQI
value shall be in the range of +/-2 of the reported median more than 90%
of the time. If the HS-PDSCH BLER using the transport format indicated
by median CQI is less than or equal to 0.1, the BLER using the transport
format indicated by the (median CQI +2) shall be greater than 0.1. If
the HS-PDSCH BLER using the transport format indicated by the median CQI
is greater than 0.1, the BLER using transport format indicated by
(median CQI -1) shall be less than or equal to 0.1.

The reference for this requirement is TS 25.101 \[1\] clause 9.3.1.1.

#### 9.3.1.3 Test purpose

To verify that the variance of the CQI reports when using TF based on
CQI 16 is within the limits defined and that a BLER of 10% falls between
the TF based on Median CQI-1 and the TF based on Median CQI TF or
between the TF based on Median CQI and the TF based on Median CQI+2.

#### 9.3.1.4 Method of test

##### 9.3.1.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: normal; see clauses G.2.1 and G.2.2.

Frequencies to be tested: mid range; see clause G.2.4.

1\. Connect SS and an AWGN noise source to the UE antenna connector as
shown in figure A.9.

2\. Set Ack/Nack handling at the SS such that regardless of the response
from the UE (Ack, Nack or DTX) new data is sent each time, this is
because HARQ transmissions are set to one, i.e. no re-transmission of
failed blocks. The sending of new data means that for each HARQ process
the new data indicator bit in the HS-SCCH toggles for consecutive
transmissions.

##### 9.3.1.4.2 Procedure

1\) Set up an HSDPA call with looping back 12.2kbps RMC according to TS
34.108 \[3\] clause 7.3.6 with levels according to table E.5.0, and with
the following exceptions in the RADIO BEARER SETUP message.

  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2\) Set test conditions according to test 1 in table 9.3.1.1. The
configuration of the downlink channels is defined in table E.5.1.

NOTE: The following part of the procedure will test if the UE reports a
limited range of CQI values under the predefined channel conditions.

3\) The SS shall send the TF according to CQI value 16 and keep it
regardless of the CQI value sent by the UE. Continue transmission of the
HS-PDSCH until 2000 CQI reports have been gathered. In this process the
SS collects CQI reports every 2 ms and also cases where UE transmits
nothing in its CQI field (CQI0) are counted as CQI reports.

4\) Set up a relative frequency distribution for the CQI-values,
reported. Calculate the median value (Median CQI is the CQI that is at
or crosses 50% distribution from the lower CQI side). This CQI-value is
declared as Median CQI value,

5\) If 1800 or more of the CQI values are in the range (Median CQI - 2)
≤ Median CQI ≤ (Median CQI + 2) then continue with step 6), otherwise
fail the UE.

NOTE: The following part of the procedure will test if BLER versus CQI
has the correct sense.

6\) The SS shall transmit the TF according to the median-CQI value and
shall not react to the UE's CQI reports. For any HSDPA block transmitted
by the SS, record the associated ACK, NACK and statDTX responses. The
responses are then filtered as follows: for the sequence of responses
for each HARQ process, discard all the statDTX responses. If the number
of consecutive discarded statDTX for any one process is an odd number
including one, also discard the next response for that HARQ process
regardless whether it is an ACK or NACK. Continue to gather data until
the number of filtered ACK+NACK responses reaches 1000.

For the filtered ACK and NACK responses if the ratio ( NACK / ACK +
NACK) \< 0.1 then goto step 7), otherwise goto step 8)

7\) The SS shall transmit the TF according to the median-CQI+2 value and
shall not react to the UE's CQIreports. For any HSDPA block, transmitted
by the SS, record and filter the ACK, NACK and statDTX responses as in
step 6 until 1000 filtered ACK+NACK responses are gathered.

If the ratio (NACK /ACK + NACK ) ≥ 0.1

then pass the UE, otherwise fail the UE

8\) The SS shall transmit the TF according to the median-CQI-1 value and
shall not react to the UE's CQI value. For any HSDPA block, transmitted
by the SS, record and filter the ACK, NACK and statDTX responses as in
step 6 until 1000 filtered ACK+NACK responses are gathered.

If the ratio ( NACK / ACK + NACK) \< 0.1

then pass the UE, otherwise fail the UE.

NOTE: The statistical selectivity based on 1000 samples is not
sufficient to distinguish between BLER \< 0.1 and \> 0.1. However, it is
assumed that the difference between\
\
\[true BLER on Median CQI - true BLER on (Median CQI + 2)\] and\
\[true BLER on Median CQI - true BLER on (Median CQI - 1)\]\
\
is large enough to exceed the statistical uncertainty and hence the
measurement can indicate the correct sense of BLER.

9\) Repeat the same procedure (steps 3 to 8 ) with test conditions
according to the table 9.3.1.1 for Test 2 and Test 3.

#### 9.3.1.5 Test Requirements

The pass fail decision is as specified in the test procedure in clause
9.3.1.4.2.

There are no parameters in the test setup or measurement process whose
variation impacts the results so there are no applicable test tolerances
for this test.

### 9.3.1A Single Link Performance - AWGN Propagation Conditions, 64QAM

#### 9.3.1A.1 Definition and applicability

The reporting accuracy of channel quality indicator (CQI) under AWGN
environments is determined by the reporting variance and the BLER
performance using the transport format indicated by the reported CQI
median.

The requirements and this test apply to Release 7 for all types of UTRA
for the FDD UE that support HSDPA UE capability categories 13, 14, 17
and 18.

The requirements and this test apply to Release 8 and later releases for
all types of UTRA for the FDD UE that support HSDPA UE capability
categories 13, 14, 17, 18, 19 and 20.

#### 9.3.1A.2 Minimum requirements

For the parameters specified in Table 9.3.1A.1, and using the downlink
physical channels specified in table E.5.1A the reported CQI value shall
be in the range of +/-2 of the reported median more than 90% of the
time. If the HS-PDSCH BLER using the transport format indicated by
median CQI is less than or equal to 0.1, the BLER using the transport
format indicated by the (median CQI +2) shall be greater than 0.1. If
the HS-PDSCH BLER using the transport format indicated by the median CQI
is greater than 0.1, the BLER using transport format indicated by
(median CQI -1) shall be less than or equal to 0.1.

The reference for this requirement is TS 25.101 \[1\] clause 9.3.1.1.2.

#### 9.3.1A.3 Test purpose

To verify that the variance of the CQI reports when using TF based on
CQI 16 is within the limits defined and that a BLER of 10% falls between
the TF based on Median CQI-1 and the TF based on Median CQI TF or
between the TF based on Median CQI and the TF based on Median CQI+2.

#### 9.3.1A.4 Method of test

##### 9.3.1A.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: normal; see clauses G.2.1 and G.2.2.

Frequencies to be tested: mid range; see clause G.2.4.

1\. Connect SS and an AWGN noise source to the UE antenna connector as
shown in figure A.9.

2\. Set Ack/Nack handling at the SS such that regardless of the response
from the UE (Ack, Nack or DTX) new data is sent each time, this is
because HARQ transmissions are set to one, i.e. no re-transmission of
failed blocks. The sending of new data means that for each HARQ process
the new data indicator bit in the HS-SCCH toggles for consecutive
transmissions.

##### 9.3.1A.4.2 Procedure

1\. Set up an HSDPA call with looping back 12.2kbps RMC according to TS
34.108 \[3\] clause 7.3.6 with levels according to table E.5.0, and with
the following exceptions.

2\. Set test conditions according to test 1 in table 9.3.1A.1. The
configuration of the downlink channels is defined in table E.5.1A.

NOTE: The following part of the procedure will test if the UE reports a
limited range of CQI values under the predefined channel conditions.

3\. The SS shall send the TF according to CQI value 16 and keep it
regardless of the CQI value sent by the UE. Continue transmission of the
HS-PDSCH until 2000 CQI reports have been gathered. In this process the
SS collects CQI reports every 2 ms and also cases where UE transmits
nothing in its CQI field (CQI0) are counted as CQI reports.

4\. Set up a relative frequency distribution for the CQI-values,
reported. Calculate the median value (Median CQI is the CQI that is at
or crosses 50% distribution from the lower CQI side). This CQI-value is
declared as Median CQI value,

5\. If 1800 or more of the CQI values are in the range (Median CQI - 2)
≤ Median CQI ≤ (Median CQI + 2) then continue with step 6), otherwise
fail the UE.

NOTE: The following part of the procedure will test if BLER versus CQI
has the correct sense.

6\) The SS shall transmit the TF according to the median-CQI value and
shall not react to the UE's CQI reports. For any HSDPA block transmitted
by the SS, record the associated ACK, NACK and statDTX responses. The
responses are then filtered as follows: for the sequence of responses
for each HARQ process, discard all the statDTX responses. If the number
of consecutive discarded statDTX for any one process is an odd number
including one, also discard the next response for that HARQ process
regardless whether it is an ACK or NACK. Continue to gather data until
the number of filtered ACK+NACK responses reaches 1000.

> For the filtered ACK and NACK responses if the ratio ( NACK / ACK +
> NACK) \< 0.1 then goto step 7), otherwise goto step 8)

7\. The SS shall transmit the TF according to the median-CQI+2 value and
shall not react to the UE's CQIreports. For any HSDPA block, transmitted
by the SS, record and filter the ACK, NACK and statDTX responses as in
step 6 until 1000 filtered ACK+NACK responses are gathered.

If the ratio (NACK /ACK + NACK ) ≥ 0.1

then pass the UE, otherwise fail the UE

8\. The SS shall transmit the TF according to the median-CQI-1 value and
shall not react to the UE's CQI value. For any HSDPA block, transmitted
by the SS, record and filter the ACK, NACK and statDTX responses as in
step 6 until 1000 filtered ACK+NACK responses are gathered.

If the ratio ( NACK / ACK + NACK) \< 0.1

then pass the UE, otherwise fail the UE.

NOTE: The statistical selectivity based on 1000 samples is not
sufficient to distinguish between BLER \< 0.1 and \> 0.1. However, it is
assumed that the difference between\
\
\[true BLER on Median CQI - true BLER on (Median CQI + 2)\] and\
\[true BLER on Median CQI - true BLER on (Median CQI - 1)\]\
\
is large enough to exceed the statistical uncertainty and hence the
measurement can indicate the correct sense of BLER.

#### 9.3.1A.5 Test Requirements

The pass fail decision is as specified in the test procedure in clause
9.3.1A.4.2.

There are no parameters in the test setup or measurement process whose
variation impacts the results so there are no applicable test tolerances
for this test.

### 9.3.1B Single Link Performance - AWGN Propagation Conditions, DC-HSDPA requirements

#### 9.3.1B.1 Definition and applicability

The reporting accuracy of channel quality indicator (CQI) under AWGN
environments is determined by the reporting variance and the BLER
performance using the transport format indicated by the reported CQI
median.

The requirements and this test apply to Release 8 and later releases for
all types of UTRA for the FDD UE that support DC- HSDPA UE capability
categories 21, 22, 23 and 24.

The requirements and this test apply for Release 9 and later releases to
all types of UTRA for the FDD UE that support DC-HSDPA UE capability
categories 25-28.

#### 9.3.1B.2 Minimum requirements

For the parameters specified in Table 9.3.1B.1, and using the downlink
physical channels specified in table E.5.1, with both primary and
secondary cells configured, for each of the serving cells, the reported
CQI value for the cell shall be in the range of +/-2 of the
cell-specific reported median more than 90% of the time. If the HS-PDSCH
BLER, for any of the cells, using the transport format indicated by
cell-specific median CQI is less than or equal to 0.1, the BLER for this
cell using the transport format indicated by the (cell-specific median
CQI +2) shall be greater than 0.1. If the HS-PDSCH BLER, for any of the
cells, using the transport format indicated by the cell-specific median
CQI is greater than 0.1, the BLER for this cell using transport format
indicated by (cell-specific median CQI -1) shall be less than or equal
to 0.1.

The reference for this requirement is TS 25.101 \[1\] clause 9.3.1.1.3.

#### 9.3.1B.3 Test purpose

To verify that the variance of the CQI reports when using TF based on
CQI 16 on each of the serving cells is within the limits defined and
that a BLER of 10% falls between the TF based on cell specific Median
CQI-1 and the TF based on cell specific Median CQI TF or between the TF
based on cell specific Median CQI and the TF based on cell specific
Median CQI+2.

#### 9.3.1B.4 Method of test

##### 9.3.1B.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: normal; see clauses G.2.1 and G.2.2.

Frequencies to be tested: mid range; see clause G.2.4.

1\. Connect the SS and an AWGN noise source to the UE antenna connector
as shown in figure A.38.

2\. Set Ack/Nack handling at the SS for each cell such that regardless
of the response from the UE (Ack, Nack or DTX) new data is sent each
time, this is because HARQ transmissions are set to one, i.e. no
re-transmission of failed blocks. The sending of new data means that for
each HARQ process the new data indicator bit in the HS-SCCH toggles for
consecutive transmissions.

##### 9.3.1B.4.2 Procedure

1\) Set up an HSDPA call according to TS 34.108 \[3\] clause 7.3.13 with
levels according to table E.5.0, and with the exceptions for information
elements listed in table 9.3.1B.2.

2\) Set test conditions according to test 1 in table 9.3.1B.1 for both
serving HS-DSCH cell and the secondary serving HS-DSCH cell. The
configuration of the downlink channels is defined in table E.5.1 for
serving HS-DSCH cell, and for secondary serving HS-DSCH cell set up
P-CPICH, HS-PDSCH and HS-SCCH channels only per table E.5.1.

NOTE: The following part of the procedure will test if the UE reports a
limited range of CQI values under the predefined channel conditions.

3\) The SS shall send the TF according to CQI value 16 on each of the
serving HS-DSCH cell and keep it regardless of the CQI value sent by the
UE. Continue transmission of the HS-PDSCH until 2000 composite CQI
reports have been gathered. In this process the SS collects composite
CQI reports every 2 ms.

4\) Set up a relative frequency distribution for each of the reported
cell specific CQI-values. Calculate the cell specific median value for
each cell (Median CQI is the CQI that is at or crosses 50% distribution
from the lower CQI side). This CQI-value is declared as Median CQI value
of that cell.

5\) If 1800 or more of the cell specific CQI values are in the range
(cell specific Median CQI - 2) ≤ (cell specific Median CQI) ≤ (cell
specific Median CQI + 2) for each cell then continue with step 6),
otherwise fail the UE.

NOTE: The following part of the procedure will test if BLER versus CQI
has the correct sense.

6\) The SS shall transmit the TF according to the cell specific
median-CQI value on each of the cell and shall not react to the UE's
composite CQI reports. For any HSDPA block transmitted by the SS, record
the associated ACK, NACK and statDTX responses on each of the cell. The
responses are then filtered as follows: for the sequence of responses
for each HARQ process, discard all the statDTX responses. If the number
of consecutive discarded statDTX for any one process is an odd number
including one, also discard the next response for that HARQ process
regardless whether it is an ACK or NACK. Continue to gather data until
the number of filtered ACK+NACK responses on each of the cell reaches
1000.

Based on the ratio (NACK/ACK + NACK) for each of the cell, follow the
below condition:

If (NACK/ACK+NACk) \< 0.1 Goto step 7

Else Goto step 8

7\) The SS shall transmit the TF according to the cell specific
median-CQI+2 value and shall not react to the UE's composite CQIreports.
For any HSDPA block, transmitted by the SS on any of the serving cell,
record and filter the ACK, NACK and statDTX responses as in step 6 until
1000 filtered ACK+NACK responses are gathered for that cell.

If the ratio (NACK /ACK + NACK ) ≥ 0.1

then pass the UE, otherwise fail the UE

8\) The SS shall transmit the TF according to the cell specific
median-CQI-1 value and shall not react to the UE's composite CQI value.
For any HSDPA block, transmitted by the SS on any of the serving cell,
record and filter the ACK, NACK and statDTX responses as in step 6 until
1000 filtered ACK+NACK responses are gathered for that cell.

If the ratio ( NACK / ACK + NACK) \< 0.1

then pass the UE, otherwise fail the UE.

NOTE: The statistical selectivity based on 1000 samples is not
sufficient to distinguish between BLER \< 0.1 and \> 0.1. However, it is
assumed that the difference between\
\
\[true BLER on Median CQI - true BLER on (Median CQI + 2)\] and\
\[true BLER on Median CQI - true BLER on (Median CQI - 1)\]\
\
is large enough to exceed the statistical uncertainty and hence the
measurement can indicate the correct sense of BLER.

9\) The test case is considered pass only if steps 5-8 are satisfied for
both the cells.

#### 9.3.1B.5 Test Requirements

The pass fail decision is as specified in the test procedure in clause
9.3.1B.4.2.

There are no parameters in the test setup or measurement process whose
variation impacts the results so there are no applicable test tolerances
for this test.

### 9.3.1BA Single Link Performance - AWGN Propagation Conditions, DB-DC-HSDPA requirements

#### 9.3.1BA.1 Definition and applicability

The reporting accuracy of channel quality indicator (CQI) under AWGN
environments is determined by the reporting variance and the BLER
performance using the transport format indicated by the reported CQI
median.

The requirements and this test apply for Release 9 and later releases to
all types of UTRA for the FDD UE that support DB-DC-HSDPA UE capability
categories 21-28.

DB-DC-HSDPA is designed to operate in configurations specified in clause
4.2.

#### 9.3.1BA.2 Minimum requirements

For the parameters specified in Table 9.3.1BA.1, and using the downlink
physical channels specified in table E.5.1, with both primary and
secondary cells configured, for each of the serving cells, the reported
CQI value for the cell shall be in the range of +/-2 of the
cell-specific reported median more than 90% of the time. If the HS-PDSCH
BLER, for any of the cells, using the transport format indicated by
cell-specific median CQI is less than or equal to 0.1, the BLER for this
cell using the transport format indicated by the (cell-specific median
CQI +2) shall be greater than 0.1. If the HS-PDSCH BLER, for any of the
cells, using the transport format indicated by the cell-specific median
CQI is greater than 0.1, the BLER for this cell using transport format
indicated by (cell-specific median CQI -1) shall be less than or equal
to 0.1.

The reference for this requirement is TS 25.101 \[1\] clause 9.3.1.1.3.

9.3.1BA.3 Test purpose

To verify that the variance of the CQI reports when using TF based on
CQI 16 on each of the serving cells is within the limits defined and
that a BLER of 10% falls between the TF based on cell specific Median
CQI-1 and the TF based on cell specific Median CQI TF or between the TF
based on cell specific Median CQI and the TF based on cell specific
Median CQI+2.

#### 9.3.1BA.4 Method of test

##### 9.3.1BA.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: normal; see clauses G.2.1 and G.2.2.

Frequencies to be tested: mid range; see clause G.2.4.

1\. Connect the SS and an AWGN noise source to the UE antenna connector
as shown in figure A.38.

2\. Set Ack/Nack handling at the SS for each cell such that regardless
of the response from the UE (Ack, Nack or DTX) new data is sent each
time, this is because HARQ transmissions are set to one, i.e. no
re-transmission of failed blocks. The sending of new data means that for
each HARQ process the new data indicator bit in the HS-SCCH toggles for
consecutive transmissions.

##### 9.3.1BA.4.2 Procedure

1\) Set up an HSDPA call according to TS 34.108 \[3\] clause 7.3.13 with
levels according to table E.5.0, and with the exceptions for information
elements listed in table 9.3.1BA.2.

  ---------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------

2\) Set test conditions according to test 1 in table 9.3.1BA.1 for both
serving HS-DSCH cell and the secondary serving HS-DSCH cell. The
configuration of the downlink channels is defined in table E.5.1 for
serving HS-DSCH cell, and for secondary serving HS-DSCH cell set up
P-CPICH, HS-PDSCH and HS-SCCH channels only per table E.5.1.

NOTE: The following part of the procedure will test if the UE reports a
limited range of CQI values under the predefined channel conditions.

3\) The SS shall send the TF according to CQI value 16 on each of the
serving HS-DSCH cell and keep it regardless of the CQI value sent by the
UE. Continue transmission of the HS-PDSCH until 2000 composite CQI
reports have been gathered. In this process the SS collects composite
CQI reports every 2 ms.

4\) Set up a relative frequency distribution for each of the reported
cell specific CQI-values. Calculate the cell specific median value for
each cell (Median CQI is the CQI that is at or crosses 50% distribution
from the lower CQI side). This CQI-value is declared as Median CQI value
of that cell.

5\) If 1800 or more of the cell specific CQI values are in the range
(cell specific Median CQI - 2) ≤ (cell specific Median CQI) ≤ (cell
specific Median CQI + 2) for each cell then continue with step 6),
otherwise fail the UE.

> NOTE: The following part of the procedure will test if BLER versus CQI
> has the correct sense.

6\) The SS shall transmit the TF according to the cell specific
median-CQI value on each of the cell and shall not react to the UE's
composite CQI reports. For any HSDPA block transmitted by the SS, record
the associated ACK, NACK and statDTX responses on each of the cell. The
responses are then filtered as follows: for the sequence of responses
for each HARQ process, discard all the statDTX responses. If the number
of consecutive discarded statDTX for any one process is an odd number
including one, also discard the next response for that HARQ process
regardless whether it is an ACK or NACK. Continue to gather data until
the number of filtered ACK+NACK responses on each of the cell reaches
1000.

> Based on the ratio (NACK/ACK + NACK) for each of the cell, follow the
> below condition:
>
> If (NACK/ACK+NACk) \< 0.1 Goto step 7
>
> Else Goto step 8

7\) The SS shall transmit the TF according to the cell specific
median-CQI+2 value and shall not react to the UE's composite CQIreports.
For any HSDPA block, transmitted by the SS on any of the serving cell,
record and filter the ACK, NACK and statDTX responses as in step 6 until
1000 filtered ACK+NACK responses are gathered for that cell.

> If the ratio (NACK /ACK + NACK ) ≥ 0.1
>
> then pass the UE, otherwise fail the UE

8\) The SS shall transmit the TF according to the cell specific
median-CQI-1 value and shall not react to the UE's composite CQI value.
For any HSDPA block, transmitted by the SS on any of the serving cell,
record and filter the ACK, NACK and statDTX responses as in step 6 until
1000 filtered ACK+NACK responses are gathered for that cell.

> If the ratio ( NACK / ACK + NACK) \< 0.1
>
> then pass the UE, otherwise fail the UE.

NOTE: The statistical selectivity based on 1000 samples is not
sufficient to distinguish between BLER \< 0.1 and \> 0.1. However, it is
assumed that the difference between\
\
\[true BLER on Median CQI - true BLER on (Median CQI + 2)\] and\
\[true BLER on Median CQI - true BLER on (Median CQI - 1)\]\
\
is large enough to exceed the statistical uncertainty and hence the
measurement can indicate the correct sense of BLER.

9\) The test case is considered pass only if steps 5-8 are satisfied for
both the cells.

#### 9.3.1BA.5 Test Requirements

The pass fail decision is as specified in the test procedure in clause
9.3.1BA.4.2.

There are no parameters in the test setup or measurement process whose
variation impacts the results so there are no applicable test tolerances
for this test.

### 9.3.1BB Single Link Performance - AWGN Propagation Conditions, 4C-HSDPA requirements (3 Carriers)

#### 9.3.1BB.1 Definition and applicability

The reporting accuracy of channel quality indicator (CQI) under AWGN
environments is determined by the reporting variance and the BLER
performance using the transport format indicated by the reported CQI
median.

The requirements and this test apply for Release 10 and later releases
to all types of UTRA for the FDD UE that support 4C-HSDPA UE capability
categories 29 and 30.

#### 9.3.1BB.2 Minimum requirements

For the parameters specified in Table 9.3.1BB.1, and using the downlink
physical channels specified in table E.5.1, with both primary and
secondary cells configured, for each of the serving cells, the reported
CQI value for the cell shall be in the range of +/-2 of the
cell-specific reported median more than 90% of the time. If the HS-PDSCH
BLER, for any of the cells, using the transport format indicated by
cell-specific median CQI is less than or equal to 0.1, the BLER for this
cell using the transport format indicated by the (cell-specific median
CQI +2) shall be greater than 0.1. If the HS-PDSCH BLER, for any of the
cells, using the transport format indicated by the cell-specific median
CQI is greater than 0.1, the BLER for this cell using transport format
indicated by (cell-specific median CQI -1) shall be less than or equal
to 0.1.

The reference for this requirement is TS 25.101 \[1\] clause 9.3.1.1.3.

9.3.1BB.3 Test purpose

To verify that the variance of the CQI reports when using TF based on
CQI 16 on each of the serving cells is within the limits defined and
that a BLER of 10% falls between the TF based on cell specific Median
CQI-1 and the TF based on cell specific Median CQI TF or between the TF
based on cell specific Median CQI and the TF based on cell specific
Median CQI+2.

#### 9.3.1BB.4 Method of test

##### 9.3.1BB.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: normal; see clauses G.2.1 and G.2.2.

Frequencies to be tested: mid range; see clause G.2.4.

1\. Connect the SS and an AWGN noise source to the UE antenna connector
as shown in figureA.46.

2\. Set Ack/Nack handling at the SS for each cell such that regardless
of the response from the UE (Ack, Nack or DTX) new data is sent each
time, this is because HARQ transmissions are set to one, i.e. no
re-transmission of failed blocks. The sending of new data means that for
each HARQ process the new data indicator bit in the HS-SCCH toggles for
consecutive transmissions.

##### 9.3.1BB.4.2 Procedure

1\) Set up an HSDPA call according to TS 34.108 \[3\] clause 7.3.16 with
levels according to table E.5.0, and with the exceptions for information
elements listed in table 9.3.1BB.2.

2\) Set test conditions according to test 1 in table 9.3.1BB.1 for both
serving HS-DSCH cell and the secondary serving HS-DSCH cells. The
configuration of the downlink channels is defined in table E.5.1 for
serving HS-DSCH cell, and for secondary serving HS-DSCH cells set up
P-CPICH, HS-PDSCH and HS-SCCH channels only per table E.5.1.

NOTE 1: The following part of the procedure will test if the UE reports
a limited range of CQI values under the predefined channel conditions.

3\) The SS shall send the TF according to CQI value 16 on each of the
serving HS-DSCH cell and keep it regardless of the CQI value sent by the
UE. Continue transmission of the HS-PDSCH until 2000 composite CQI
reports have been gathered. In this process the SS collects composite
CQI reports every 2 ms.

4\) Set up a relative frequency distribution for each of the reported
cell specific CQI-values. Calculate the cell specific median value for
each cell (Median CQI is the CQI that is at or crosses 50% distribution
from the lower CQI side). This CQI-value is declared as Median CQI value
of that cell.

5\) If 1800 or more of the cell specific CQI values are in the range
(cell specific Median CQI - 2) ≤ (cell specific Median CQI) ≤ (cell
specific Median CQI + 2) for each cell then continue with step 6),
otherwise fail the UE.

NOTE: The following part of the procedure will test if BLER versus CQI
has the correct sense.

6\) The SS shall transmit the TF according to the cell specific
median-CQI value on each of the cell and shall not react to the UE's
composite CQI reports. For any HSDPA block transmitted by the SS, record
the associated ACK, NACK and statDTX responses on each of the cell. The
responses are then filtered as follows: for the sequence of responses
for each HARQ process, discard all the statDTX responses. If the number
of consecutive discarded statDTX for any one process is an odd number
including one, also discard the next response for that HARQ process
regardless whether it is an ACK or NACK. Continue to gather data until
the number of filtered ACK+NACK responses on each of the cell reaches
1000.

> Based on the ratio (NACK/ACK + NACK) for each of the cell, follow the
> below condition:
>
> If (NACK/ACK+NACk) \< 0.1 Goto step 7
>
> Else Goto step 8

7\) The SS shall transmit the TF according to the cell specific
median-CQI+2 value and shall not react to the UE's composite CQIreports.
For any HSDPA block, transmitted by the SS on any of the serving cell,
record and filter the ACK, NACK and statDTX responses as in step 6 until
1000 filtered ACK+NACK responses are gathered for that cell.

> If the ratio (NACK /ACK + NACK ) ≥ 0.1
>
> then pass the UE, otherwise fail the UE

8\) The SS shall transmit the TF according to the cell specific
median-CQI-1 value and shall not react to the UE's composite CQI value.
For any HSDPA block, transmitted by the SS on any of the serving cell,
record and filter the ACK, NACK and statDTX responses as in step 6 until
1000 filtered ACK+NACK responses are gathered for that cell.

> If the ratio ( NACK / ACK + NACK) \< 0.1
>
> then pass the UE, otherwise fail the UE.

NOTE 2: The statistical selectivity based on 1000 samples is not
sufficient to distinguish between BLER \< 0.1 and \> 0.1. However, it is
assumed that the difference between\
\[true BLER on Median CQI - true BLER on (Median CQI + 2)\] and\
\[true BLER on Median CQI - true BLER on (Median CQI - 1)\]\
is large enough to exceed the statistical uncertainty and hence the
measurement can indicate the correct sense of BLER.

9\) The test case is considered pass only if steps 5-8 are satisfied for
all 3 cells.

#### 9.3.1BB.5 Test Requirements

The pass fail decision is as specified in the test procedure in clause
9.3.1BB.4.2.

There are no parameters in the test setup or measurement process whose
variation impacts the results so there are no applicable test tolerances
for this test.

### 9.3.1BC Single Link Performance - AWGN Propagation Conditions, 4C-HSDPA requirements

#### 9.3.1BC.1 Definition and applicability

The reporting accuracy of channel quality indicator (CQI) under AWGN
environments is determined by the reporting variance and the BLER
performance using the transport format indicated by the reported CQI
median.

The requirements and this test apply for Release 10 and later releases
to all types of UTRA for the FDD UE that support 4C-HSDPA UE capability
categories 31 and 32.

#### 9.3.1BC.2 Minimum requirements

For the parameters specified in Table 9.3.1BC.1, and using the downlink
physical channels specified in table E.5.1, with both primary and
secondary cells configured, for each of the serving cells, the reported
CQI value for the cell shall be in the range of +/-2 of the
cell-specific reported median more than 90% of the time. If the HS-PDSCH
BLER, for any of the cells, using the transport format indicated by
cell-specific median CQI is less than or equal to 0.1, the BLER for this
cell using the transport format indicated by the (cell-specific median
CQI +2) shall be greater than 0.1. If the HS-PDSCH BLER, for any of the
cells, using the transport format indicated by the cell-specific median
CQI is greater than 0.1, the BLER for this cell using transport format
indicated by (cell-specific median CQI -1) shall be less than or equal
to 0.1.

The reference for this requirement is TS 25.101 \[1\] clause 9.3.1.1.3.

9.3.1BC.3 Test purpose

To verify that the variance of the CQI reports when using TF based on
CQI 16 on each of the serving cells is within the limits defined and
that a BLER of 10% falls between the TF based on cell specific Median
CQI-1 and the TF based on cell specific Median CQI TF or between the TF
based on cell specific Median CQI and the TF based on cell specific
Median CQI+2.

#### 9.3.1BC.4 Method of test

##### 9.3.1BC.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: normal; see clauses G.2.1 and G.2.2.

Frequencies to be tested: mid range; see clause G.2.4.

1\. Connect the SS and an AWGN noise source to the UE antenna connector
as shown in figureA.46.

2\. Set Ack/Nack handling at the SS for each cell such that regardless
of the response from the UE (Ack, Nack or DTX) new data is sent each
time, this is because HARQ transmissions are set to one, i.e. no
re-transmission of failed blocks. The sending of new data means that for
each HARQ process the new data indicator bit in the HS-SCCH toggles for
consecutive transmissions.

##### 9.3.1BC.4.2 Procedure

1\) Set up an HSDPA call according to TS 34.108 \[3\] clause 7.3.16 with
levels according to table E.5.0, and with the exceptions for information
elements listed in table 9.3.1BC.2.

2\) Set test conditions according to test 1 in table 9.3.1BC.1 for both
serving HS-DSCH cell and the secondary serving HS-DSCH cells. The
configuration of the downlink channels is defined in table E.5.1 for
serving HS-DSCH cell, and for secondary serving HS-DSCH cells set up
P-CPICH, HS-PDSCH and HS-SCCH channels only per table E.5.1.

NOTE 1: The following part of the procedure will test if the UE reports
a limited range of CQI values under the predefined channel conditions.

3\) The SS shall send the TF according to CQI value 16 on each of the
serving HS-DSCH cell and keep it regardless of the CQI value sent by the
UE. Continue transmission of the HS-PDSCH until 2000 composite CQI
reports have been gathered. In this process the SS collects composite
CQI reports every 2 ms.

4\) Set up a relative frequency distribution for each of the reported
cell specific CQI-values. Calculate the cell specific median value for
each cell (Median CQI is the CQI that is at or crosses 50% distribution
from the lower CQI side). This CQI-value is declared as Median CQI value
of that cell.

5\) If 1800 or more of the cell specific CQI values are in the range
(cell specific Median CQI - 2) ≤ (cell specific Median CQI) ≤ (cell
specific Median CQI + 2) for each cell then continue with step 6),
otherwise fail the UE.

> NOTE 2: The following part of the procedure will test if BLER versus
> CQI has the correct sense.

6\) The SS shall transmit the TF according to the cell specific
median-CQI value on each of the cell and shall not react to the UE's
composite CQI reports. For any HSDPA block transmitted by the SS, record
the associated ACK, NACK and statDTX responses on each of the cell. The
responses are then filtered as follows: for the sequence of responses
for each HARQ process, discard all the statDTX responses. If the number
of consecutive discarded statDTX for any one process is an odd number
including one, also discard the next response for that HARQ process
regardless whether it is an ACK or NACK. Continue to gather data until
the number of filtered ACK+NACK responses on each of the cell reaches
1000.

> Based on the ratio (NACK/ACK + NACK) for each of the cell, follow the
> below condition:
>
> If (NACK/ACK+NACk) \< 0.1 Goto step 7
>
> Else Goto step 8

7\) The SS shall transmit the TF according to the cell specific
median-CQI+2 value and shall not react to the UE's composite CQIreports.
For any HSDPA block, transmitted by the SS on any of the serving cell,
record and filter the ACK, NACK and statDTX responses as in step 6 until
1000 filtered ACK+NACK responses are gathered for that cell.

> If the ratio (NACK /ACK + NACK ) ≥ 0.1
>
> then pass the UE, otherwise fail the UE

8\) The SS shall transmit the TF according to the cell specific
median-CQI-1 value and shall not react to the UE's composite CQI value.
For any HSDPA block, transmitted by the SS on any of the serving cell,
record and filter the ACK, NACK and statDTX responses as in step 6 until
1000 filtered ACK+NACK responses are gathered for that cell.

> If the ratio ( NACK / ACK + NACK) \< 0.1
>
> then pass the UE, otherwise fail the UE.

NOTE 3: The statistical selectivity based on 1000 samples is not
sufficient to distinguish between BLER \< 0.1 and \> 0.1. However, it is
assumed that the difference between\
\[true BLER on Median CQI - true BLER on (Median CQI + 2)\] and\
\[true BLER on Median CQI - true BLER on (Median CQI - 1)\]\
is large enough to exceed the statistical uncertainty and hence the
measurement can indicate the correct sense of BLER.

9\) The test case is considered pass only if steps 5-8 are satisfied for
all 4 cells.

#### 9.3.1BC.5 Test Requirements

The pass fail decision is as specified in the test procedure in clause
9.3.1BC.4.2.

There are no parameters in the test setup or measurement process whose
variation impacts the results so there are no applicable test tolerances
for this test.

### 9.3.2AB Single Link Performance - Fading Propagation Conditions, 4C-HSDPA requirements(3 Carriers)

#### 9.3.2AB.1 Definition and applicability

The reporting accuracy of the channel quality indicator (CQI) under
fading environments is determined by the BLER performance using the
transport format indicated by the reported CQI median.

The requirements and this test apply for Release 10 and later releases
to all types of UTRA for the FDD UE that support 4C-HSDPA UE capability
categories 29 and 30.

#### 9.3.2AB.2 Minimum requirements

For the parameters specified in Table 9.3.2AB.1 and using the downlink
physical channels specified in table E.5.1, with both primary and
secondary serving cells configured, for each of the serving cells, the
requirements are specified in terms of maximum BLERs at particular
reported CQIs when transmitting a cell specific fixed transport format
given by the cell specific CQI median as shown in Table 9.3.2AB.2. The
BLER at a particular reported CQI for a specific serving cell is
obtained by associating a particular CQI reference measurement period
with the HS-PDSCH subframe transmitted from this serving cell
overlapping with the end of this CQI reference measurement period and
calculating the fraction of erroneous HS-PDSCH subframes.

The reference for this requirement is TS 25.101 \[1\] clause 9.3.1.2.3.

#### 9.3.2AB.3 Test purpose

To verify that when using the TF based on the cell specific Median CQI
the BLER for blocks associated with composite CQI reports of cell
specific Median CQI is ≤ 60% and that the BLER for blocks associated
with composite CQI reports of cell specific Median CQI+3 is ≤ 15%.

#### 9.3.2AB.4 Method of test

##### 9.3.2AB.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: normal; see clauses G.2.1 and G.2.2.

Frequencies to be tested: mid range; see clause G.2.4.

1\) Connect SS, multipath fading simulator and an AWGN noise source to
the UE antenna connector as shown in figure A.46.

2\) Set Ack/Nack handling at the SS on each cell such that regardless of
the response from the UE (Ack, Nack or DTX) new data is sent each time,
this is because HARQ transmissions are set to one, i.e. no
re-transmission of failed blocks. The sending of new data means that for
each HARQ process the new data indicator bit in the HS-SCCH toggles for
consecutive transmissions.

##### 9.3.2AB.4.2 Procedure

1\) Set up an HSDPA call according to TS 34.108 \[3\] clause 7.3.16 with
levels according to table E.5.0, and with the exceptions for information
elements listed in table 9.3.2AB.3.

2\) Set test conditions according to test 1 in table 9.3.2AB.1 on both
the serving HS-DSCH cell and the secondary serving HS-DSCH cells. The
configuration of the downlink channels is defined in table E.5.1 for

FFS

2\) The SS shall send TF according to CQI value 16 on each of the
serving cell and keep it regardless of the CQI value sent by the UE.
Continue transmission of the HS-PDSCH until 8200 composite CQI reports
have been gathered. In this process the SS collects composite CQI
reports every 2 ms.

3\) Set up a relative frequency distribution for each of the cell
specific reported CQI values. Calculate the cell specific median value
for each cell (Median CQI is the CQI that is at or crosses 50%
distribution from the lower CQI side). This CQI-value is declared as
Median CQI value for that serving cell.

4\) The SS shall transmit the TF according to the cell specific
median-CQI value and shall not react to the UE's reported CQI value on
each cell. For any HSDPA block transmitted by the SS, record the ACK,
NACK and statDTX responses on each cell, and associate with each
response the CQI report that corresponds to the CQI evaluation period in
which the end of the HS-PDSCH is received. (See figure 9.3.2AB.4
below.)\
\
The responses are then filtered as follows: for the sequence of
responses for each HARQ process, discard all the statDTX responses. If
the number of consecutive discarded statDTX for any one process is an
odd number including one, also discard the next response for that HARQ
process regardless whether it is an ACK or NACK. Continue to gather and
filter responses until 1000 filtered responses for each serving cell
with CQI = Median CQI and 1000 filtered responses with CQI = Median CQI
+ 3 have been collected.

5\) Measure BLER as described below.

In the test there are two BLER requirements to be tested:

R1: HSDPA block with corresponding reported cell specific CQI = cell
specific Median CQI BLER ≤ 60%

R2: HSDPA block with corresponding reported cell specific CQI = cell
specific Median CQI + 3 BLER ≤ 15%

Figure 9.3.2AB.4: Combination of ACK/NACK message and the CQI report for
BLER calculation

For each set of samples R1 and R2 the BLER = (NACK) / (ACK + NACK)

Repeat the same procedure with test conditions according to the test 2
of table 9.3.2AB.1.

#### 9.3.2AB.5 Test Requirements

The measured BLER shall not exceed values specified in table 9.3.2AB.2
for each of the serving cells.

There are no parameters in the test setup or measurement process whose
variation impacts the results so there are no applicable test tolerances
for this test.

### 9.3.2AC Single Link Performance - Fading Propagation Conditions, 4C-HSDPA requirements

#### 9.3.2AC.1 Definition and applicability

The reporting accuracy of the channel quality indicator (CQI) under
fading environments is determined by the BLER performance using the
transport format indicated by the reported CQI median.

The requirements and this test apply for Release 10 and later releases
to all types of UTRA for the FDD UE that support 4C-HSDPA UE capability
categories 31 and 32.

#### 9.3.2AC.2 Minimum requirements

For the parameters specified in Table 9.3.2AC.1 and using the downlink
physical channels specified in table E.5.1, with both primary and
secondary serving cells configured, for each of the serving cells, the
requirements are specified in terms of maximum BLERs at particular
reported CQIs when transmitting a cell specific fixed transport format
given by the cell specific CQI median as shown in Table 9.3.2AC.2. The
BLER at a particular reported CQI for a specific serving cell is
obtained by associating a particular CQI reference measurement period
with the HS-PDSCH subframe transmitted from this serving cell
overlapping with the end of this CQI reference measurement period and
calculating the fraction of erroneous HS-PDSCH subframes.

The reference for this requirement is TS 25.101 \[1\] clause 9.3.1.2.3.

#### 9.3.2AC.3 Test purpose

To verify that when using the TF based on the cell specific Median CQI
the BLER for blocks associated with composite CQI reports of cell
specific Median CQI is ≤ 60% and that the BLER for blocks associated
with composite CQI reports of cell specific Median CQI+3 is ≤ 15%.

#### 9.3.2AC.4 Method of test

##### 9.3.2AC.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: normal; see clauses G.2.1 and G.2.2.

Frequencies to be tested: mid range; see clause G.2.4.

1\) Connect SS, multipath fading simulator and an AWGN noise source to
the UE antenna connector as shown in figure A.46.

2\) Set Ack/Nack handling at the SS on each cell such that regardless of
the response from the UE (Ack, Nack or DTX) new data is sent each time,
this is because HARQ transmissions are set to one, i.e. no
re-transmission of failed blocks. The sending of new data means that for
each HARQ process the new data indicator bit in the HS-SCCH toggles for

3\) The SS shall send TF according to CQI value 16 on each of the
serving cell and keep it regardless of the CQI value sent by the UE.
Continue transmission of the HS-PDSCH until 8200 composite CQI reports
have been gathered. In this process the SS collects composite CQI
reports every 2 ms.

4\) Set up a relative frequency distribution for each of the cell
specific reported CQI values. Calculate the cell specific median value
for each cell (Median CQI is the CQI that is at or crosses 50%
distribution from the lower CQI side). This CQI-value is declared as
Median CQI value for that serving cell.

5\) The SS shall transmit the TF according to the cell specific
median-CQI value and shall not react to the UE's reported CQI value on
each cell. For any HSDPA block transmitted by the SS, record the ACK,
NACK and statDTX responses on each cell, and associate with each
response the CQI report that corresponds to the CQI evaluation period in
which the end of the HS-PDSCH is received. (See figure 9.3.2AC.4
below.)\
The responses are then filtered as follows: for the sequence of
responses for each HARQ process, discard all the statDTX responses. If
the number of consecutive discarded statDTX for any one process is an
odd number including one, also discard the next response for that HARQ
process regardless whether it is an ACK or NACK. Continue to gather and
filter responses until 1000 filtered responses for each serving cell
with CQI = Median CQI and 1000 filtered responses with CQI = Median CQI
+ 3 have been collected.

6\) Measure BLER as described below.

In the test there are two BLER requirements to be tested:

R1: HSDPA block with corresponding reported cell specific CQI = cell
specific Median CQI BLER ≤ 60%

R2: HSDPA block with corresponding reported cell specific CQI = cell
specific Median CQI + 3 BLER ≤ 15%

Figure 9.3.2AC.4: Combination of ACK/NACK message and the CQI report for
BLER calculation

For each set of samples R1 and R2 the BLER = (NACK) / (ACK + NACK)

Repeat the same procedure with test conditions according to the test 2
of table 9.3.2AC.1.

#### 9.3.2AC.5 Test Requirements

The measured BLER shall not exceed values specified in table 9.3.2AC.2
for each of the serving cells.

There are no parameters in the test setup or measurement process whose
variation impacts the results so there are no applicable test tolerances
for this test.

### 9.3.1C Single Link Performance - AWGN Propagation Conditions, Periodically Varying Radio Conditions

-   *Editor's note: Applicability statement in 34.121-2 to be added*

#### 9.3.1C.1 Definition and applicability

The reporting accuracy of the channel quality indicator (CQI) when
subject to AWGN propagation conditions with periodically varying radio
conditions, is determined by the reporting variance.

The requirements and this test apply to Release 8 and later releases for
all types of UTRA for the FDD UE that support HSDPA UE capability
categories 1 to 20.

#### 9.3.1C.2 Minimum requirements

The reporting accuracy of the channel quality indicator (CQI) when
subject to AWGN propagation conditions with periodically varying , is
determined by the reporting variance, as measured during selected parts
of a predetermined pattern, as depicted in Figure 9.3.1C.1.

Figure 9.3.1C.1 Test scenario for CQI reporting test under varying
interference conditions. is varied between α1 and α2 according to a
predetermined square wave pattern.

For the parameters specified in Table 9.3.1C.1, and using the downlink
physical channels specified in table E.5.1 for HSDPA categories 1-8, 11
and 12 or in Table E.5.1A for other HSDPA categories, let M~1~ be
defined as the median CQI that the UE reports in static propagation
conditions, with Ior/Ioc set to α~1~, and M~2~ be the median CQI that
the UE reports in static propagation conditions, with set to α~2~. The
minimum difference between M~1~ and M~2~ is required to be larger than
6.

For the parameters specified in Table 9.3.1C.1, and using the downlink
physical channels specified in table E.5.1 for HSDPA categories 1-8, 11
and 12 or in Table E.5.1A for other HSDPA categories, 90% of the
reported CQI values, during T~measure~ as depicted in Figure 9.3.1C.1,
shall be in the range of +/-3 of M1, for the cases when T~measure~
occurs during time-periods where is set to α~1,~ and in the range of
+/-3 of M2, for the cases when T~measure~ occurs during time-periods
where is set to α~2~.

The measurement equipment is allowed to start the ramping of 13 slots
before the start of the HS-DPCCH slot that contains the first CQI report
in T~measure~.

The measurement equipment shall have settled to its nominal value 10
slots before the start of the HS-DPCCH slot that contains the first CQI
report in T~measure~.

An illustration of these timing relations is provided in Figure
9.3.1C.2.

Figure 9.3.1C.2 Timing relation between HS-DPCCH, DPCCH/DPDCH and
ramping. The measurement equipment starts ramping the at point 1. The
should be settled to its nominal value at point 2. The first CQI report
that is counted in the statistics of the requirement is transmitted in
the uplink at point 3.

The reference for this requirement is TS 25.101 \[1\] clause 9.3.1.3.1

#### 9.3.1C.3 Test purpose

To verify that the variance of the CQI reports is within the limits
defined and that the difference between the average reported CQI values,
for two different , is within the defined limit.

#### 9.3.1C.4 Method of test

##### 9.3.1C.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: normal; see clauses G.2.1 and G.2.2.

Frequencies to be tested: mid range; see clause G.2.4.

1\. Connect SS and an AWGN noise source to the UE antenna connector as
shown in figure A.9.

2\. Set Ack/Nack handling at the SS such that regardless of the response
from the UE (Ack, Nack or DTX) new data is sent each time, this is
because HARQ transmissions are set to one, i.e. no re-transmission of
failed blocks. The sending of new data means that for each HARQ process
the new data indicator bit in the HS-SCCH toggles for consecutive
transmissions.

##### 9.3.1C.4.2 Procedure

1\) Set up an HSDPA call with looping back 12.2kbps RMC according to TS
34.108 \[3\] clause 7.3.6 with levels according to table E.5.0, and with
the following exceptions in the RADIO BEARER SETUP message.

2\) Set test conditions according to test 1 in table 9.3.1C.1. The
configuration of the downlink channels is defined in table E.5.1. Every
24 ms the SS shall toggle the I~oc~ level between I~oc1~ and I~oc2~.

3\) The SS shall send the TF according to CQI value 16 and keep it
regardless of the CQI value sent by the UE.

4\) Wait for one second and then start to gather CQI reports during
continuous transmission of the HS-PDSCH. In this process the SS collects
chunks of 8 consecutive CQI reports (T~measure)~, starting with the sub
frame occurring 8 ms after a change of I~oc~ level, according to figure
9.3.1C.2. All other CQI reports (T~settle~ + T~delay~) will be
discarded. Cases where UE transmits nothing in its CQI field (CQI0) are
counted as CQI reports. The collected CQI pattern would be
"...OOOOHHHHHHHHOOOOLLLLLLLLOOOO...", where "O" indicates discarded CQI
reports, "H" indicates CQI reports corresponding to high and "L"
indicates CQI reports corresponding to low . Stop when 4000 reports have
been gathered.

5\) Set up a relative frequency distribution for the collected
CQI-values, belonging to the I~oc1~ value. Calculate the median CQI
value (Median CQI is the CQI that is at or crosses 50% distribution from
the lower CQI side). This CQI-value is declared as Median CQI value,
M~1~.

6\) Set up a relative frequency distribution for the collected
CQI-values, belonging to the I~oc2~ value. Calculate the median CQI
value (Median CQI is the CQI that is at or crosses 50% distribution from
the lower CQI side). This CQI-value is declared as Median CQI value,
M~2~.

7\) If 1800 or more of the collected CQI values, reported for I~oc1~,
are in the range (Median CQI M~1~ - 3) ≤ Median CQI ≤ (Median CQI M~1~ +
3) then continue with step 8), otherwise fail the UE.

8\) If 1800 or more of the CQI values, reported for I~oc2~, are in the
range (Median CQI M~2~ - 3) ≤ Median CQI ≤ (Median CQI M~2~ + 3) then
continue with step 9), otherwise fail the UE.

9\) If the difference between M~1~ and M~2~ is greater than 6-TT=5 then
pass the UE, otherwise fail the UE.

#### 9.3.1C.5 Test Requirements

The pass fail decision is as specified in the test procedure in clause
9.3.1C.4.2.

### 9.3.2 Single Link Performance - Fading Propagation Conditions

#### 9.3.2.1 Definition and applicability

The reporting accuracy of the channel quality indicator (CQI) under
fading environments is determined by the BLER performance using the
transport format indicated by the reported CQI median.

The requirements and this test apply to Release 5 for all types of UTRA
for the FDD UE that support HSDPA UE capability categories 1 - 8, 11 and
12.

The requirements and this test apply to Release 6 and later releases for
all types of UTRA for the FDD UE that support HSDPA UE capability
categories 1 to 12.

The requirements and this test apply to Release 7 and later releases for
all types of UTRA for the FDD UE that support HSDPA UE capability
categories 13 to 20.

#### 9.3.2.2 Minimum requirements

For the parameters specified in Table 9.3.2.1, and using the downlink
physical channels specified in table E.5.1, the requirements are
specified in terms of maximum BLERs at particular reported CQIs when
transmitting a fixed transport format given by the CQI median as shown
in Table 9.3.2.2. The BLER at a particular reported CQI is obtained by
associating a particular CQI reference measurement period with the
HS-PDSCH subframe overlapping with the end of this CQI reference
measurement period and calculating the fraction of erroneous HS-PDSCH
subframes.

  ---------------- -------------- -------

The reference for this requirement is TS 25.101 \[1\] clause 9.3.1.2.

#### 9.3.2.3 Test purpose

To verify that when using the TF based on the Median CQI that the BLER
for blocks associated with CQI reports of Median CQI is ≤ 60% and that
the BLER for blocks associated with CQI reports of Median CQI+3 is ≤
15%.

#### 9.3.2.4 Method of test

##### 9.3.2.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: normal; see clauses G.2.1 and G.2.2.

Frequencies to be tested: mid range; see clause G.2.4.

1\) Connect SS, multipath fading simulator and an AWGN noise source to
the UE antenna connector as shown in figure A.10.

2\) Set Ack/Nack handling at the SS such that regardless of the response
from the UE (Ack, Nack or DTX) new data is sent each time, this is
because HARQ transmissions are set to one, i.e. no re-transmission of
failed blocks. The sending of new data means that for each HARQ process
the new data indicator bit in the HS-SCCH toggles for consecutive
transmissions.

##### 9.3.2.4.2 Procedure

1\) Set up an HSDPA call with looping back 12.2kbps RMC according to TS
34.108 \[3\] clause 7.3.6 with levels according to table E.5.0, and with
the following exceptions in the RADIO BEARER SETUP message. Set test
conditions according to test 1 in table 9.3.2.1. The configuration of
the downlink channels is defined in table E.5.1.

  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2\) The SS shall send TF according to CQI value 16 and keep it
regardless of the CQI value sent by the UE. Continue transmission of the
HS-PDSCH until 8200 CQI reports have been gathered. In this process the
SS collects CQI reports every 2 ms and also cases where UE transmits
nothing in its CQI field (CQI0) are counted as CQI reports.

3\) Set up a relative frequency distribution for the reported CQI
values. Calculate the median value (Median CQI is the CQI that is at or
crosses 50% distribution from the lower CQI side). This CQI-value is
declared as Median CQI value,

4\) The SS shall transmit the TF according to the median-CQI value and
shall not react to the UE's reported CQI value. For any HSDPA block
transmitted by the SS, record the ACK, NACK and statDTX responses, and
associate with each response the CQI report that corresponds to the CQI
evaluation period in which the end of the HS-PDSCH is received. (See
figure 9.3.2.1 below.)\
\
The responses are then filtered as follows: for the sequence of
responses for each HARQ process, discard all the statDTX responses. If
the number of consecutive discarded statDTX for any one process is an
odd number including one, also discard the next response for that HARQ
process regardless whether it is an ACK or NACK. Continue to gather and
filter responses until 1000 filtered responses with CQI = Median CQI and
1000 filtered responses with CQI = Median CQI + 3 have been collected.

5\) Measure BLER as described below.

In the test there are two BLER requirements to be tested:

R1: HSDPA block with corresponding reported CQI = Median CQI BLER ≤ 60%

R2: HSDPA block with corresponding reported CQI = Median CQI + 3 BLER ≤
15%

Figure 9.3.2.1 Combination of ACK/NACK message and the CQI report for
BLER calculation

For each set of samples R1 and R2 the BLER = (NACK) / (ACK + NACK)

Repeat the same procedure with test conditions according to the test 2
of table 9.3.2.1.

#### 9.3.2.5 Test Requirements

The measured BLER shall not exceed values specified in table 9.3.2.2.

There are no parameters in the test setup or measurement process whose
variation impacts the results so there are no applicable test tolerances
for this test.

### 9.3.2A Single Link Performance - Fading Propagation Conditions, DC-HSDPA requirements

#### 9.3.2A.1 Definition and applicability

The reporting accuracy of the channel quality indicator (CQI) under
fading environments is determined by the BLER performance using the
transport format indicated by the reported CQI median.

The requirements and this test apply to Release 8 and later releases for
all types of UTRA for the FDD UE that support DC- HSDPA UE capability
categories 21, 22, 23 and 24.

The requirements and this test apply for Release 9 and later releases to
all types of UTRA for the FDD UE that support DC-HSDPA UE capability
categories 25-28.

#### 9.3.2A.2 Minimum requirements

For the parameters specified in Table 9.3.2A.1 and using the downlink
physical channels specified in table E.5.1, with both primary and
secondary serving cells configured, for each of the serving cells, the
requirements are specified in terms of maximum BLERs at particular
reported CQIs when transmitting a cell specific fixed transport format
given by the cell specific CQI median as shown in Table 9.3.2A.2. The
BLER at a particular reported CQI for a specific serving cell is
obtained by associating a particular CQI reference measurement period
with the HS-PDSCH subframe transmitted from this serving cell
overlapping with the end of this CQI reference measurement period and
calculating the fraction of erroneous HS-PDSCH subframes.

  ---------------- -------------- -------

The reference for this requirement is TS 25.101 \[1\] clause 9.3.1.2.

#### 9.3.2A.3 Test purpose

To verify that when using the TF based on the cell specific Median CQI
the BLER for blocks associated with composite CQI reports of cell
specific Median CQI is ≤ 60% and that the BLER for blocks associated
with composite CQI reports of cell specific Median CQI+3 is ≤ 15%.

#### 9.3.2A.4 Method of test

##### 9.3.2A.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: normal; see clauses G.2.1 and G.2.2.

Frequencies to be tested: mid range; see clause G.2.4.

1\) Connect SS, multipath fading simulator and an AWGN noise source to
the UE antenna connector as shown in figure A.36.

2\) Set Ack/Nack handling at the SS on each cell such that regardless of
the response from the UE (Ack, Nack or DTX) new data is sent each time,
this is because HARQ transmissions are set to one, i.e. no
re-transmission of failed blocks. The sending of new data means that for
each HARQ process the new data indicator bit in the HS-SCCH toggles for
consecutive transmissions.

##### 9.3.2A.4.2 Procedure

1\) Set up an HSDPA call according to TS 34.108 \[3\] clause 7.3.13 with
levels according to table E.5.0, and with the exceptions for information
elements listed in table 9.3.2A.3.

2\) Set test conditions according to test 1 in table 9.3.2A.1 on both
the serving HS-DSCH cell and the secondary serving HS-DSCH cell. The
configuration of the downlink channels is defined in table E.5.1 for
serving S\_DSCH cell. For secondary serving cell set up P-CPICH,
HS-PDSCH and HS-SCCH channels only per table E.5.1.

  ---------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------

2\) The SS shall send TF according to CQI value 16 on each of the
serving cell and keep it regardless of the CQI value sent by the UE.
Continue transmission of the HS-PDSCH until 8200 composite CQI reports
have been gathered. In this process the SS collects composite CQI
reports every 2 ms.

3\) Set up a relative frequency distribution for each of the cell
specific reported CQI values. Calculate the cell specific median value
for each cell (Median CQI is the CQI that is at or crosses 50%
distribution from the lower CQI side). This CQI-value is declared as
Median CQI value for that serving cell.

4\) The SS shall transmit the TF according to the cell specific
median-CQI value and shall not react to the UE's reported CQI value on
each cell. For any HSDPA block transmitted by the SS, record the ACK,
NACK and statDTX responses on each cell, and associate with each
response the CQI report that corresponds to the CQI evaluation period in
which the end of the HS-PDSCH is received. (See figure 9.3.2A.4 below.)\
\
The responses are then filtered as follows: for the sequence of
responses for each HARQ process, discard all the statDTX responses. If
the number of consecutive discarded statDTX for any one process is an
odd number including one, also discard the next response for that HARQ
process regardless whether it is an ACK or NACK. Continue to gather and
filter responses until 1000 filtered responses for each serving cell
with CQI = Median CQI and 1000 filtered responses with CQI = Median CQI
+ 3 have been collected.

5\) Measure BLER as described below.

In the test there are two BLER requirements to be tested:

R1: HSDPA block with corresponding reported cell specific CQI = cell
specific Median CQI BLER ≤ 60%

R2: HSDPA block with corresponding reported cell specific CQI = cell
specific Median CQI + 3 BLER ≤ 15%

Figure 9.3.2A.4: Combination of ACK/NACK message and the CQI report for
BLER calculation

For each set of samples R1 and R2 the BLER = (NACK) / (ACK + NACK)

Repeat the same procedure with test conditions according to the test 2
of table 9.3.2A.1.

#### 9.3.2A.5 Test Requirements

The measured BLER shall not exceed values specified in table 9.3.2A.2
for each of the serving cells.

There are no parameters in the test setup or measurement process whose
variation impacts the results so there are no applicable test tolerances
for this test.

### 9.3.2AA Single Link Performance - Fading Propagation Conditions, DB-DC-HSDPA requirements

#### 9.3.2AA.1 Definition and applicability

The reporting accuracy of the channel quality indicator (CQI) under
fading environments is determined by the BLER performance using the
transport format indicated by the reported CQI median.

The requirements and this test apply for Release 9 and later releases to
all types of UTRA for the FDD UE that support DB-DC-HSDPA UE capability
categories 21-28.

DB-DC-HSDPA is designed to operate in configurations specified in clause
4.2.

#### 9.3.2AA.2 Minimum requirements

For the parameters specified in Table 9.3.2AA.1 and using the downlink
physical channels specified in table E.5.1, with both primary and
secondary serving cells configured, for each of the serving cells, the
requirements are specified in terms of maximum BLERs at particular
reported CQIs when transmitting a cell specific fixed transport format
given by the cell specific CQI median as shown in Table 9.3.2AA.2. The
BLER at a particular reported CQI for a specific serving cell is
obtained by associating a particular CQI reference measurement period
with the HS-PDSCH subframe transmitted from this serving cell
overlapping with the end of this CQI reference measurement period and
calculating the fraction of erroneous HS-PDSCH subframes.

The reference for this requirement is TS 25.101 \[1\] clause 9.3.1.2.

#### 9.3.2AA.3 Test purpose

To verify that when using the TF based on the cell specific Median CQI
the BLER for blocks associated with composite CQI reports of cell
specific Median CQI is ≤ 60% and that the BLER for blocks associated
with composite CQI reports of cell specific Median CQI+3 is ≤ 15%.

#### 9.3.2AA.4 Method of test

##### 9.3.2AA.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: normal; see clauses G.2.1 and G.2.2.

Frequencies to be tested: mid range; see clause G.2.4.

1\) Connect SS, multipath fading simulator and an AWGN noise source to
the UE antenna connector as shown in figure A.36.

2\) Set Ack/Nack handling at the SS on each cell such that regardless of
the response from the UE (Ack, Nack or DTX) new data is sent each time,
this is because HARQ transmissions are set to one, i.e. no
re-transmission of failed blocks. The sending of new data means that for
each HARQ process the new data indicator bit in the HS-SCCH toggles for
consecutive transmissions.

##### 9.3.2AA.4.2 Procedure

1\) Set up an HSDPA call according to TS 34.108 \[3\] clause 7.3.13 with
levels according to table E.5.0, and with the exceptions for information
elements listed in table 9.3.2AA.3.

2\) Set test conditions according to test 1 in table 9.3.2AA.1 on both
the serving HS-DSCH cell and the secondary serving HS-DSCH cell. The
configuration of the downlink channels is defined in table E.5.1 for
serving S\_DSCH cell. For secondary serving cell set up P-CPICH,
HS-PDSCH and HS-SCCH channels only per table E.5.1.

2\) The SS shall send TF according to CQI value 16 on each of the
serving cell and keep it regardless of the CQI value sent by the UE.
Continue transmission of the HS-PDSCH until 8200 composite CQI reports
have been gathered. In this process the SS collects composite CQI
reports every 2 ms.

3\) Set up a relative frequency distribution for each of the cell
specific reported CQI values. Calculate the cell specific median value
for each cell (Median CQI is the CQI that is at or crosses 50%
distribution from the lower CQI side). This CQI-value is declared as
Median CQI value for that serving cell.

4\) The SS shall transmit the TF according to the cell specific
median-CQI value and shall not react to the UE's reported CQI value on
each cell. For any HSDPA block transmitted by the SS, record the ACK,
NACK and statDTX responses on each cell, and associate with each
response the CQI report that corresponds to the CQI evaluation period in
which the end of the HS-PDSCH is received. (See figure 9.3.2AA.4
below.)\
\
The responses are then filtered as follows: for the sequence of
responses for each HARQ process, discard all the statDTX responses. If
the number of consecutive discarded statDTX for any one process is an
odd number including one, also discard the next response for that HARQ
process regardless whether it is an ACK or NACK. Continue to gather and
filter responses until 1000 filtered responses for each serving cell
with CQI = Median CQI and 1000 filtered responses with CQI = Median CQI
+ 3 have been collected.

5\) Measure BLER as described below.

In the test there are two BLER requirements to be tested:

R1: HSDPA block with corresponding reported cell specific CQI = cell
specific Median CQI BLER ≤ 60%

R2: HSDPA block with corresponding reported cell specific CQI = cell
specific Median CQI + 3 BLER ≤ 15%

Figure 9.3.2AA.4: Combination of ACK/NACK message and the CQI report for
BLER calculation

For each set of samples R1 and R2 the BLER = (NACK) / (ACK + NACK)

Repeat the same procedure with test conditions according to the test 2
of table 9.3.2AA.1.

#### 9.3.2AA.5 Test Requirements

The measured BLER shall not exceed values specified in table 9.3.2AA.2
for each of the serving cells.

There are no parameters in the test setup or measurement process whose
variation impacts the results so there are no applicable test tolerances
for this test.

### 9.3.2B Single Link Performance - Fading Propagation Conditions, 64QAM

#### 9.3.2B.1 Definition and applicability

The reporting accuracy of the channel quality indicator (CQI) under
fading environments is determined by the BLER performance using the
transport format indicated by the reported CQI median.

The requirements and this test apply to Release 7 for all types of UTRA
for the FDD UE that support HSDPA UE capability categories 13, 14, 17
and 18.

The requirements and this test apply to Release 8 and later releases for
all types of UTRA for the FDD UE that support HSDPA UE capability
categories 13, 14, 17, 18, 19 and 20.

#### 9.3.2B.2 Minimum requirements

For the parameters specified in Table 9.3.2B.1, and using the downlink
physical channels specified in table E.5.1A, the requirements are
specified in terms of maximum BLERs at particular reported CQIs when
transmitting a fixed transport format given by the CQI median as shown
in Table 9.3.2B.2. The BLER at a particular reported CQI is obtained by
associating a particular CQI reference measurement period with the
HS-PDSCH subframe overlapping with the end of this CQI reference
measurement period and calculating the fraction of erroneous HS-PDSCH
subframes.

Table 9.3.2B.2: Minimum requirement for CQI test in fading - single link

  ---------------- --------------
  Reported CQI     Maximum BLER
                   Test 1
  CQI median       60%
  CQI median + 3   15%
  ---------------- --------------

The reference for this requirement is TS 25.101 \[1\] clause 9.3.1.2.2.

#### 9.3.2B.3 Test purpose

To verify that when using the TF based on the Median CQI that the BLER
for blocks associated with CQI reports of Median CQI is ≤ 60% and that
the BLER for blocks associated with CQI reports of Median CQI+3 is ≤
15%.

#### 9.3.2B.4 Method of test

##### 9.3.2B.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: normal; see clauses G.2.1 and G.2.2.

Frequencies to be tested: mid range; see clause G.2.4.

1\) Connect SS, multipath fading simulator and an AWGN noise source to
the UE antenna connector as shown in figure A.10.

2\) Set Ack/Nack handling at the SS such that regardless of the response
from the UE (Ack, Nack or DTX) new data is sent each time, this is
because HARQ transmissions are set to one, i.e. no re-transmission of
failed blocks. The sending of new data means that for each HARQ process
the new data indicator bit in the HS-SCCH toggles for consecutive
transmissions.

##### 9.3.2B.4.2 Procedure

1\) Set up an HSDPA call with looping back 12.2kbps RMC according to TS
34.108 \[3\] clause 7.3.6 with levels according to table E.5.0, and with
the following exceptions in the RRC CONNECTION SETUP and RADIO BEARER
SETUP messages.

2\) Set test conditions according to test 1 in table 9.3.2B.1. The
configuration of the downlink channels is defined in table E.5.1A.

3\) The SS shall send TF according to CQI value 16 and keep it
regardless of the CQI value sent by the UE. Continue transmission of the
HS-PDSCH until 8200 CQI reports have been gathered. In this process the
SS collects CQI reports every 2 ms and also cases where UE transmits
nothing in its CQI field (CQI0) are counted as CQI reports.

4\) Set up a relative frequency distribution for the reported CQI
values. Calculate the median value (Median CQI is the CQI that is at or
crosses 50% distribution from the lower CQI side). This CQI-value is
declared as Median CQI value,

5\) The SS shall transmit the TF according to the median-CQI value and
shall not react to the UE's reported CQI value. For any HSDPA block
transmitted by the SS, record the ACK, NACK and statDTX responses, and
associate with each response the CQI report that corresponds to the CQI
evaluation period in which the end of the HS-PDSCH is received. (See
figure 9.3.2B.1 below.)\
\
The responses are then filtered as follows: for the sequence of
responses for each HARQ process, discard all the statDTX responses. If
the number of consecutive discarded statDTX for any one process is an
odd number including one, also discard the next response for that HARQ
process regardless whether it is an ACK or NACK. Continue to gather and
filter responses until 1000 filtered responses with CQI = Median CQI and
1000 filtered responses with CQI = Median CQI + 3 have been collected.

6\) Measure BLER as described below.

In the test there are two BLER requirements to be tested:

R1: HSDPA block with corresponding reported CQI = Median CQI BLER ≤ 60%

R2: HSDPA block with corresponding reported CQI = Median CQI + 3 BLER ≤
15%

Figure 9.3.2B.1: Combination of ACK/NACK message and the CQI report for
BLER calculation

For each set of samples R1 and R2 the BLER = (NACK) / (ACK + NACK)

#### 9.3.2B.5 Test Requirements

The measured BLER shall not exceed values specified in table 9.3.2B.2.

There are no parameters in the test setup or measurement process whose
variation impacts the results so there are no applicable test tolerances
for this test.

### 9.3.2C Single Link Performance - Fading Propagation Conditions, Multiflow HSDPA requirements (2 Cells)

Editor's note: This test case is incomplete. The following aspects are
either missing or not yet determined:

-   The Test Tolerances applicable to this test are undefined.

-   Connection diagram is FFS

#### 9.3.2C.1 Definition and applicability

The reporting accuracy of the channel quality indicator (CQI) under
fading environments is determined by the BLER performance using the
transport format indicated by the reported CQI median.

The requirements and this test apply for Release 11 and later releases
to all types of UTRA for the FDD UE that support Multiflow HSDPA and
HSDPA UE capability categories 21-38.

#### 9.3.2C.2 Minimum requirements

For the parameters specified in Table 9.3.2C.1 and using the downlink
physical channels specified in table E.5F.1 to E.5F.4 as applicable,
with both serving & assisting cells configured, the requirements are
specified in terms of maximum BLERs at particular reported CQIs when
transmitting a cell specific fixed transport format given by the cell
specific CQI median as shown in Table 9.3.2C.2. The BLER at a particular
reported CQI for a specific serving cell is obtained by associating a
particular CQI reference measurement period with the HS-PDSCH subframe
transmitted from this serving cell overlapping with the end of this CQI
reference measurement period and calculating the fraction of erroneous
HS-PDSCH subframes.

##### 9.3.2C.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: normal; see clauses G.2.1 and G.2.2.

Frequencies to be tested: mid range; see clause G.2.4.

1\) Connect SS, multipath fading simulator and an AWGN noise source to
the UE antenna connector as shown in figure FFS.

2\) Set Ack/Nack handling at the SS on each cell such that regardless of
the response from the UE (Ack, Nack or DTX) new data is sent each time,
this is because HARQ transmissions are set to one, i.e. no
re-transmission of failed blocks. The sending of new data means that for
each HARQ process the new data indicator bit in the HS-SCCH toggles for
consecutive transmissions.

##### 9.3.2C.4.2 Procedure

1\) Set up an HSDPA call according to TS 34.108 \[3\] clause 7.3.6 with
levels according to table E.5.0, and with the exceptions for information
elements listed in table 9.3.2C.3.

2\) Set test conditions according to test 1 in table 9.3.2C.1 on both
the serving HS-DSCH cell and the assisting serving HS-DSCH cell. The
configuration of the downlink channels is defined in table E.5F.2 for
serving HS\_DSCH cell and in table E.5F.3 for assisting serving HS-DSCH
cell.

  -------------------------------------------- --------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------

3\) The SS shall send TF according to CQI value 16 on each of the
serving cell and keep it regardless of the CQI value sent by the UE.
Continue transmission of the HS-PDSCH until 8200 composite CQI reports
have been gathered. In this process the SS collects composite CQI
reports every 2 ms.

4\) Set up a relative frequency distribution for each of the cell
specific reported CQI values. Calculate the cell specific median value
for each cell (Median CQI is the CQI that is at or crosses 50%
distribution from the lower CQI side). This CQI-value is declared as
Median CQI value for that serving cell.

5\) The SS shall transmit the TF according to the cell specific
median-CQI value and shall not react to the UE's reported CQI value on
each cell. For any HSDPA block transmitted by the SS, record the ACK,
NACK and statDTX responses on each cell, and associate with each
response the CQI report that corresponds to the CQI evaluation period in
which the end of the HS-PDSCH is received. (See figure 9.3.2C.4 below.)\
\
The responses are then filtered as follows: for the sequence of
responses for each HARQ process, discard all the statDTX responses. If
the number of consecutive discarded statDTX for any one process is an
odd number including one, also discard the next response for that HARQ
process regardless whether it is an ACK or NACK. Continue to gather and
filter responses until 1000 filtered responses for each serving cell
with CQI = Median CQI and 1000 filtered responses with CQI = Median CQI
+ 3 have been collected.

6\) Measure BLER as described below.

In the test there are two BLER requirements to be tested:

R1: HSDPA block with corresponding reported cell specific CQI = cell
specific Median CQI BLER ≤ 60%

R2: HSDPA block with corresponding reported cell specific CQI = cell
specific Median CQI + 3 BLER ≤ 15%

Figure 9.3.2C.4: Combination of ACK/NACK message and the CQI report for
BLER calculation

For each set of samples R1 and R2 the BLER = (NACK) / (ACK + NACK)

#### 9.3.2C.5 Test Requirements

The measured BLER shall not exceed values specified in table 9.3.2C.2
for each of the serving cells.

There are no parameters in the test setup or measurement process whose
variation impacts the results so there are no applicable test tolerances
for this test.

### 9.3.2CA Single Link Performance - Fading Propagation Conditions, Multiflow HSDPA requirements (3 Cells)

Editor's note: This test case is incomplete. The following aspects are
either missing or not yet determined:

-   The Test Tolerances applicable to this test are undefined.

-   Connection diagram is FFS.

#### 9.3.2CA.1 Definition and applicability

The reporting accuracy of the channel quality indicator (CQI) under
fading environments is determined by the BLER performance using the
transport format indicated by the reported CQI median.

The requirements and this test apply for Release 11 and later releases
to all types of UTRA for the FDD UE that support Multiflow HSDPA and
HSDPA UE capability categories 29-36 or 38.

#### 9.3.2CA.2 Minimum requirements

For the parameters specified in Table 9.3.2CA.1 and using the downlink
physical channels specified in table E.5F.6 for primary and secondary
serving cells and table E.5F.6 for assisting primary serving cell
configured, the requirements are specified in terms of maximum BLERs at
particular reported CQIs when transmitting a cell specific fixed
transport format given by the cell specific CQI median as shown in Table
9.3.2CA.2. The BLER at a particular reported CQI for a specific serving
cell is obtained by associating a particular CQI reference measurement
period with the HS-PDSCH subframe transmitted from this serving cell
overlapping with the end of this CQI reference measurement period and
calculating the fraction of erroneous HS-PDSCH subframes.

The reference for this requirement is TS 25.101 \[1\] clause 9.3.6.1.1.

#### 9.3.2CA.3 Test purpose

To verify that when using the TF based on the cell specific Median CQI
the BLER for blocks associated with composite CQI reports of cell
specific Median CQI is ≤ 60% and that the BLER for blocks associated
with composite CQI reports of cell specific Median CQI+3 is ≤ 15%.

#### 9.3.2CA.4 Method of test

##### 9.3.2CA.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: normal; see clauses G.2.1 and G.2.2.

Frequencies to be tested: mid range; see clause G.2.4.

1\) Connect SS, multipath fading simulator and an AWGN noise source to
the UE antenna connector as shown in figure FFS.

2\) Set Ack/Nack handling at the SS on each cell such that regardless of
the response from the UE (Ack, Nack or DTX) new data is sent each time,
this is because HARQ transmissions are set to one, i.e. no
re-transmission of failed blocks. The sending of new data means that for
each HARQ process the new data indicator bit in the HS-SCCH toggles for
consecutive transmissions.

##### 9.3.2CA.4.2 Procedure

1\) Set up an HSDPA call according to TS 34.108 \[3\] clause 7.3.13 with
levels according to table E.5.0, and with the exceptions for information
elements listed in table 9.3.2CA.3.

2\) Set test conditions according to test 1 in table 9.3.2CA.1 on all
the serving HS-DSCH cell, secondary serving HS-DSCH cell and the
assisting serving cell. The configuration of the downlink channels is
defined in table E.5F.6 for primary and secondary serving HS\_DSCH cell
and table E.5F.6 for assisting serving HS-DSCH cell.

3\) The SS shall send TF according to CQI value 16 on each of the
serving cell and keep it regardless of the CQI value sent by the UE.
Continue transmission of the HS-PDSCH until 8200 composite CQI reports
have been gathered. In this process the SS collects composite CQI
reports every 2 ms.

4\) Set up a relative frequency distribution for each of the cell
specific reported CQI values. Calculate the cell specific median value
for each cell (Median CQI is the CQI that is at or crosses 50%
distribution from the lower CQI side). This CQI-value is declared as
Median CQI value for that serving cell.

5\) The SS shall transmit the TF according to the cell specific
median-CQI value and shall not react to the UE's reported CQI value on
each cell. For any HSDPA block transmitted by the SS, record the ACK,
NACK and statDTX responses on each cell, and associate with each
response the CQI report that corresponds to the CQI evaluation period in
which the end of the HS-PDSCH is received. (See figure 9.3.2CA.4
below.)\
\
The responses are then filtered as follows: for the sequence of
responses for each HARQ process, discard all the statDTX responses. If
the number of consecutive discarded statDTX for any one process is an
odd number including one, also discard the next response for that HARQ
process regardless whether it is an ACK or NACK. Continue to gather and
filter responses until 1000 filtered responses for each serving cell
with CQI = Median CQI and 1000 filtered responses with CQI = Median CQI
+ 3 have been collected.

6\) Measure BLER as described below.

In the test there are two BLER requirements to be tested:

R1: HSDPA block with corresponding reported cell specific CQI = cell
specific Median CQI BLER ≤ 60%

R2: HSDPA block with corresponding reported cell specific CQI = cell
specific Median CQI + 3 BLER ≤ 15%

Figure 9.3.2CA.4: Combination of ACK/NACK message and the CQI report for
BLER calculation

For each set of samples R1 and R2 the BLER = (NACK) / (ACK + NACK)

#### 9.3.2CA.5 Test Requirements

The measured BLER shall not exceed values specified in table 9.3.2CA.2
for each of the serving cells.

There are no parameters in the test setup or measurement process whose
variation impacts the results so there are no applicable test tolerances
for this test.

### 9.3.3 Open Loop Diversity Performance - AWGN Propagation Conditions

##### 9.3.3.1 Definition and applicability

The reporting accuracy of channel quality indicator (CQI) under AWGN
environments is determined by the reporting variance and the BLER
performance using the transport format indicated by the reported CQI
median.

The requirements and this test apply to Release 6 and later releases for
all types of UTRA for the FDD UE that support HSDPA UE capability
categories 1 to 12.The requirements and this test apply to Release 7 and
later releases for all types of UTRA for the FDD UE that support HSDPA
UE capability categories 13 to 20.

##### 9.3.3.2 Minimum requirements

For the parameters specified in Table 9.3.3.1, and using the downlink
physical channels specified in table E.5.2 the reported CQI value shall
be in the range of +/-2 of the reported median more than 90% of the
time. If the HS-PDSCH BLER using the transport format indicated by
median CQI is less than or equal to 0.1, the BLER using the transport
format indicated by the (median CQI +2) shall be greater than 0.1. If
the HS-PDSCH BLER using the transport format indicated by the median CQI
is greater than 0.1, the BLER using transport format indicated by
(median CQI -1) shall be less than or equal to 0.1.

The reference for this requirement is TS 25.101 \[1\] clause 9.3.2.1.

#### 9.3.3.3 Test purpose

To verify that the variance of the CQI reports when using TF based on
CQI 16 is within the limits defined and that a BLER of 10% falls between
the TF based on Median CQI-1 and the TF based on Median CQI TF or
between the TF based on Median CQI and the TF based on Median CQI+2.

#### 9.3.3.4 Method of test

##### 9.3.3.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: normal; see clauses G.2.1 and G.2.2.

Frequencies to be tested: mid range; see clause G.2.4.

1\. Connect SS and an AWGN noise source to the UE antenna connector as
shown in figure A.12a.

2\. Set Ack/Nack handling at the SS such that regardless of the response
from the UE (Ack, Nack or DTX) new data is sent each time, this is
because HARQ transmissions are set to one, i.e. no re-transmission of
failed blocks. The sending of new data means that for each HARQ process
the new data indicator bit in the HS-SCCH toggles for consecutive
transmissions.

##### 9.3.3.4.2 Procedure

1\) Set up an HSDPA call with looping back 12.2kbps RMC according to TS
34.108 \[3\] clause 7.3.6 with the exceptions for information elements
listed in table 9.3.3.2, with levels according to table E.5.0.

2\) Set test conditions according to test 1 according table 9.3.3.1. The
configuration of the downlink channels is defined in table E.5.2.

NOTE: The following part of the procedure will test if the UE reports a
limited range of CQI values under the predefined channel conditions.

3\) The SS shall send the TF according to CQI value 16 and keep it
regardless of the CQI value sent by the UE. Continue transmission of the
HS-PDSCH until 2000 CQI reports have been gathered. In this process the
SS collects CQI reports every 2 ms and also cases where UE transmits
nothing in its CQI field (CQI0) are counted as CQI reports.

4\) Set up a relative frequency distribution for the CQI-values,
reported. Calculate the median value (Median CQI is the CQI that is at
or crosses 50% distribution from the lower CQI side). This CQI-value is
declared as Median CQI value,

5\) If 1800 or more of the CQI values are in the range (Median CQI - 2)
≤ Median CQI ≤ ( Median CQI + 2) then continue with step 6), otherwise
fail the UE.

NOTE: The following part of the procedure will test if BLER versus CQI
has the correct sense.

6\) The SS shall transmit the TF according to the median-CQI value and
shall not react to the UE's CQI reports. For any HSDPA block transmitted
by the SS, record the associated ACK, NACK and statDTX responses. The
responses are then filtered as follows: for the sequence of responses
for each HARQ process, discard all the statDTX responses. If the number
of consecutive discarded statDTX for any one process is an odd number
including one, also discard the next response for that HARQ process
regardless whether it is an ACK or NACK. Continue to gather data until
the number of filtered ACK+NACK responses reaches 1000.

For the filtered ACK and NACK responses if the ratio ( NACK / ACK +
NACK) \< 0.1 then goto step 7), otherwise goto step 8)

7\) The SS shall transmit the TF according to the median-CQI+2 value and
shall not react to the UE's CQIreports. For any HSDPA block, transmitted
by the SS, record and filter the ACK, NACK and statDTX responses as in
step 6 until 1000 filtered ACK+NACK responses are gathered.

If the ratio (NACK /ACK + NACK ) ≥ 0.1

then pass the UE, otherwise fail the UE

8\) The SS shall transmit the TF according to the median-CQI-1 value and
shall not react to the UE's CQI value. For any HSDPA block, transmitted
by the SS, record and filter the ACK, NACK and statDTX responses as in
step 6 until 1000 filtered ACK+NACK responses are gathered.

If the ratio ( NACK / ACK + NACK) \< 0.1

then pass the UE, otherwise fail the UE.

NOTE: The statistical selectivity based on 1000 samples is not
sufficient to distinguish between BLER \< 0.1 and \> 0.1. However, it is
assumed that the difference between\
\
\[true BLER on Median CQI - true BLER on (Median CQI + 2)\] and\
\[true BLER on Median CQI - true BLER on (Median CQI - 1)\]\
\
is large enough to exceed the statistical uncertainty and hence the
measurement can indicate the correct sense of BLER.

9\) Repeat the same procedure (steps 3 to 8 ) with test conditions
according to the table 9.3.3.1 for Test 2 and Test 3.

#### 9.3.3.5 Test Requirements

The pass fail decision is as specified in the test procedure in clause
9.3.3.4.2.

There are no parameters in the test setup or measurement process whose
variation impacts the results so there are no applicable test tolerances
for this test.

### 9.3.4 Open Loop Diversity Performance - Fading Propagation Conditions

#### 9.3.4.1 Definition and applicability

The reporting accuracy of the channel quality indicator (CQI) under
fading environments is determined by the BLER performance using the
transport format indicated by the reported CQI median.

The requirements and this test apply to Release 6 and later releases for
all types of UTRA for the FDD UE that support HSDPA UE capability
categories 1 to 12.

The requirements and this test apply to Release 7 and later releases for
all types of UTRA for the FDD UE that support HSDPA UE capability
categories 13 to 20.

#### 9.3.4.2 Minimum requirements

For the parameters specified in Table 9.3.4.1, and using the downlink
physical channels specified in table E.5.2, the requirements are
specified in terms of maximum BLERs at particular reported CQIs when
transmitting a fixed transport format given by the CQI median as shown
in Table 9.3.4.2.. The BLER at a particular reported CQI is obtained by
associating a particular CQI reference measurement period with the
HS-PDSCH subframe overlapping with the end of this CQI reference
measurement period and calculating the fraction of erroneous HS-PDSCH
subframes.

from the UE (Ack, Nack or DTX) new data is sent each time, this is
because HARQ transmissions are set to one, i.e. no re-transmission of
failed blocks. The sending of new data means that for each HARQ process
the new data indicator bit in the HS-SCCH toggles for consecutive
transmissions.

3\) Setup the fading simulators with fading conditions as described in
table D.2.2.1B and clause D.2.7.

##### 9.3.4.4.2 Procedure

1\) Set up an HSDPA call with looping back 12.2kbps RMC according to TS
34.108 \[3\] clause 7.3.6 with the exceptions for information elements
listed in table 9.3.4.3, with levels according to table E.5.0. Set test
conditions according to test 1 according table 9.3.4.1. The
configuration of the downlink channels is defined in table E.5.2.

2\) The SS shall send TF according to CQI value 16 and keep it
regardless of the CQI value sent by the UE. Continue transmission of the
HS-PDSCH until 8200 CQI reports have been gathered. In this process the
SS collects CQI reports every 2 ms and also cases where UE transmits
nothing in its CQI field (CQI0) are counted as CQI reports.

3\) Set up a relative frequency distribution for the reported CQI
values. Calculate the median value (Median CQI is the CQI that is at or
crosses 50% distribution from the lower CQI side). This CQI-value is
declared as Median CQI value,

4\) The SS shall transmit the TF according to the median-CQI value and
shall not react to the UE's reported CQI value. For any HSDPA block
transmitted by the SS, record the ACK, NACK and statDTX responses, and
associate with each response the CQI report that corresponds to the CQI
evaluation period in which the end of the HS-PDSCH is received. (See
figure 9.3.4.1 below.)\
\
The responses are then filtered as follows: for the sequence of
responses for each HARQ process, discard all the statDTX responses. If
the number of consecutive discarded statDTX for any one process is an
odd number including one, also discard the next response for that HARQ
process regardless whether it is an ACK or NACK. Continue to gather and
filter responses until 1000 filtered responses with CQI = Median CQI and
1000 filtered responses with CQI = Median CQI + 3 have been collected.

5\) Measure BLER as described below.

In the test there are two BLER requirements to be tested:

R1: HSDPA block with corresponding reported CQI = Median CQI BLER ≤ 60%

R2: HSDPA block with corresponding reported CQI = Median CQI + 3 BLER ≤
15%

Figure 9.3.4.1 Combination of ACK/NACK message and the CQI report for
BLER calculation

For each set of events R1 and R2 the BLER = (NACK) / (ACK + NACK)

Repeat the same procedure with test conditions according to the test 2
of table 9.3.4.1.

#### 9.3.4.5 Test Requirements

The measured BLER shall not exceed values specified in table 9.3.4.2.

There are no parameters in the test setup or measurement process whose
variation impacts the results so there are no applicable test tolerances
for this test.

### 9.3.5 Closed Loop Diversity Performance - AWGN Propagation Conditions

##### 9.3.5.1 Definition and applicability

The reporting accuracy of channel quality indicator (CQI) under AWGN
environments is determined by the reporting variance and the BLER
performance using the transport format indicated by the reported CQI
median.

The requirements and this test apply to Release 6 and later releases for
all types of UTRA for the FDD UE that support HSDPA UE capability
categories 1 to 12.The requirements and this test apply to Release 7 and
later releases for all types of UTRA for the FDD UE that support HSDPA
UE capability categories 13 to 20.

##### 9.3.5.2 Minimum requirements

For the parameters specified in Table 9.3.5.1, and using the downlink
physical channels specified in table E.5.3 the reported CQI value shall
be in the range of +/-2 of the reported median more than 90% of the
time. If the HS-PDSCH BLER using the transport format indicated by
median CQI is less than or equal to 0.1, the BLER using the transport
format indicated by the (median CQI +2) shall be greater than 0.1. If
the HS-PDSCH BLER using the transport format indicated by the median CQI
is greater than 0.1, the BLER using transport format indicated by
(median CQI -1) shall be less than or equal to 0.1.

The reference for this requirement is TS 25.101 \[1\] clause 9.3.3.1.

#### 9.3.5.3 Test purpose

To verify that the variance of the CQI reports when using TF based on
CQI 16 is within the limits defined and that a BLER of 10% falls between
the TF based on Median CQI-1 and the TF based on Median CQI TF or
between the TF based on Median CQI and the TF based on Median CQI+2.

#### 9.3.5.4 Method of test

##### 9.3.5.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: normal; see clauses G.2.1 and G.2.2.

Frequencies to be tested: mid range; see clause G.2.4.

1\. Connect SS and an AWGN noise source to the UE antenna connector as
shown in figure A.12a.

2\. Set Ack/Nack handling at the SS such that regardless of the response
from the UE (Ack, Nack or DTX) new data is sent each time, this is
because HARQ transmissions are set to one, i.e. no re-transmission of
failed blocks. The sending of new data means that for each HARQ process
the new data indicator bit in the HS-SCCH toggles for consecutive
transmissions.

##### 9.3.5.4.2 Procedure

1\) Set up an HSDPA call with looping back 12.2kbps RMC according to TS
34.108 \[3\] clause 7.3.6 with the exceptions for information elements
listed in table 9.3.5.2, with levels according to table E.5.0.

2\) Set test conditions according to test 1 according table 9.3.5.1. The
configuration of the downlink channels is defined in table E.5.3.

NOTE: The following part of the procedure will test if the UE reports a
limited range of CQI values under the predefined channel conditions.

3\) The SS shall send the TF according to CQI value 16 and keep it
regardless of the CQI value sent by the UE. Continue transmission of the
HS-PDSCH until 2000 CQI reports have been gathered. In this process the
SS collects CQI reports every 2 ms and also cases where UE transmits
nothing in its CQI field (CQI0) are counted as CQI reports.

4\) Set up a relative frequency distribution for the CQI-values,
reported. Calculate the median value (Median CQI is the CQI that is at
or crosses 50% distribution from the lower CQI side). This CQI-value is
declared as Median CQI value,

5\) If 1800 or more of the CQI values are in the range (Median CQI - 2)
≤ Median CQI ≤ ( Median CQI + 2) then continue with step 6), otherwise
fail the UE.

NOTE: The following part of the procedure will test if BLER versus CQI
has the correct sense.

6\) The SS shall transmit the TF according to the median-CQI value and
shall not react to the UE's CQI reports. For any HSDPA block transmitted
by the SS, record the associated ACK, NACK and statDTX responses. The
responses are then filtered as follows: for the sequence of responses
for each HARQ process, discard all the statDTX responses. If the number
of consecutive discarded statDTX for any one process is an odd number
including one, also discard the next response for that HARQ process
regardless whether it is an ACK or NACK. Continue to gather data until
the number of filtered ACK+NACK responses reaches 1000.

For the filtered ACK and NACK responses if the ratio ( NACK / ACK +
NACK) \< 0.1 then goto step 7), otherwise goto step 8)

7\) The SS shall transmit the TF according to the median-CQI+2 value and
shall not react to the UE's CQIreports. For any HSDPA block, transmitted
by the SS, record and filter the ACK, NACK and statDTX responses as in
step 6 until 1000 filtered ACK+NACK responses are gathered.

If the ratio (NACK /ACK + NACK ) ≥ 0.1

then pass the UE, otherwise fail the UE

8\) The SS shall transmit the TF according to the median-CQI-1 value and
shall not react to the UE's CQI value. For any HSDPA block, transmitted
by the SS, record and filter the ACK, NACK and statDTX responses as in
step 6 until 1000 filtered ACK+NACK responses are gathered.

If the ratio ( NACK / ACK + NACK) \< 0.1

then pass the UE, otherwise fail the UE.

NOTE: The statistical selectivity based on 1000 samples is not
sufficient to distinguish between BLER \< 0.1 and \> 0.1. However, it is
assumed that the difference between\
\
\[true BLER on Median CQI - true BLER on (Median CQI + 2)\] and\
\[true BLER on Median CQI - true BLER on (Median CQI - 1)\]\
\
is large enough to exceed the statistical uncertainty and hence the
measurement can indicate the correct sense of BLER.

9\) Repeat the same procedure (steps 3 to 8 ) with test conditions
according to the table 9.3.5.1 for Test 2 and Test 3.

#### 9.3.5.5 Test Requirements

The pass fail decision is as specified in the test procedure in clause
9.3.5.4.2.

There are no parameters in the test setup or measurement process whose
variation impacts the results so there are no applicable test tolerances
for this test.

### 9.3.6 Closed Loop Diversity Performance - Fading Propagation Conditions

#### 9.3.6.1 Definition and applicability

The reporting accuracy of the channel quality indicator (CQI) under
fading environments is determined by the BLER performance using the
transport format indicated by the reported CQI median.

The requirements and this test apply to Release 6 and later releases for
all types of UTRA for the FDD UE that support HSDPA UE capability
categories 1 to 12.

The requirements and this test apply to Release 7 and later releases for
all types of UTRA for the FDD UE that support HSDPA UE capability
categories 13 to 20.

#### 9.3.6.2 Minimum requirements

For the parameters specified in Table 9.3.6.1, and using the downlink
physical channels specified in table E.5.3, the requirements are
specified in terms of maximum BLERs at particular reported CQIs when
transmitting a fixed transport format given by the CQI median as shown
in Table 9.3.6.2. The BLER at a particular reported CQI is obtained by
associating a particular CQI reference measurement period with the
HS-PDSCH subframe overlapping with the end of this CQI reference
measurement period and calculating the fraction of erroneous HS-PDSCH
subframes.

The reference for this requirement is TS 25.101 \[1\] clause 9.3.3.2.

#### 9.3.6.3 Test purpose

To verify that when using the TF based on the Median CQI that the BLER
for blocks associated with CQI reports of Median CQI is ≤ 60% and that
the BLER for blocks associated with CQI reports of Median CQI+3 is ≤
15%.

#### 9.3.6.4 Method of test

##### 9.3.6.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: normal; see clauses G.2.1 and G.2.2.

Frequencies to be tested: mid range; see clause G.2.4.

1\) Connect SS, multipath fading simulator and an AWGN noise source to
the UE antenna connector as shown in figure A.12.

2\) Set Ack/Nack handling at the SS such that regardless of the response
from the UE (Ack, Nack or DTX) new data is sent each time, this is
because HARQ transmissions are set to one, i.e. no re-transmission of
failed blocks.

3\) Setup the fading simulators with fading conditions as described in
table D.2.2.1B and clause D.2.7.

##### 9.3.6.4.2 Procedure

1\) Set up an HSDPA call with looping back 12.2kbps RMC according to TS
34.108 \[3\] clause 7.3.6 with the exceptions for information elements
listed in table 9.3.6.3, with levels according to table E.5.0. Set test
conditions according to test 1 according table 9.3.6.1. The
configuration of the downlink channels is defined in table E.5.3.

2\) The SS shall send TF according to CQI value 16 and keep it
regardless of the CQI value sent by the UE. Continue transmission of the
HS-PDSCH until 8200 CQI reports have been gathered. In this process the
SS collects CQI reports every 2 ms and also cases where UE transmits
nothing in its CQI field (CQI0) are counted as CQI reports.

3\) Set up a relative frequency distribution for the reported CQI
values. Calculate the median value (Median CQI is the CQI that is at or
crosses 50% distribution from the lower CQI side). This CQI-value is
declared as Median CQI value,

4\) The SS shall transmit the TF according to the median-CQI value and
shall not react to the UE's reported CQI value. For any HSDPA block
transmitted by the SS, record the ACK, NACK and statDTX responses, and
associate with each response the CQI report that corresponds to the CQI
evaluation period in which the end of the HS-PDSCH is received. (See
figure 9.3.6.1 below.)\
\
The responses are then filtered as follows: for the sequence of
responses for each HARQ process, discard all the statDTX responses. If
the number of consecutive discarded statDTX for any one process is an
odd number including one, also discard the next response for that HARQ
process regardless whether it is an ACK or NACK. Continue to gather and
filter responses until 1000 filtered responses with CQI = Median CQI and
1000 filtered responses with CQI = Median CQI + 3 have been collected.

5\) Measure BLER as described below.

In the test there are two BLER requirements to be tested:

R1: HSDPA block with corresponding reported CQI = Median CQI BLER ≤ 60%

R2: HSDPA block with corresponding reported CQI = Median CQI + 3 BLER ≤
15%

Figure 9.3.6.1 Combination of ACK/NACK message and the CQI report for
BLER calculation

For each set of events R1 and R2 the BLER = (NACK) / (ACK + NACK)

Repeat the same procedure with test conditions according to the test 2
of table 9.3.6.1.

#### 9.3.6.5 Test Requirements

The measured BLER shall not exceed values specified in table 9.3.6.2.

There are no parameters in the test setup or measurement process whose
variation impacts the results so there are no applicable test tolerances
for this test.

### 9.3.7 MIMO Performance - Reporting of Channel Quality Indicator

The test cases in this section define the MIMO Performance test for
Reporting of Channel Quality Indicator.

### 9.3.7A MIMO Single Stream Fading Conditions

#### 9.3.7A.1 Definition and applicability

The minimum performance requirements of channel quality indicator (CQI)
reporting under MIMO single stream conditions are defined based on a CQI
Type A versus Type B reporting ratio of 1 / 2, i.e. the parameters
*N*\_cqi\_typeA and *M*\_cqi (see \[5\]) are assumed to be set to 1 and
2, respectively. The propagation conditions assumed for minimum
performance requirements of CQI reporting under MIMO single stream
conditions are defined in subclause D.2.9.1. The precoding used at the
transmitter is one randomly picked but fixed precoding vector for single
transport block transmission out of the set of possible precoding
vectors as defined in \[5\]. The same precoding vector shall be used to
generate the resulting channel coefficients as described for MIMO single
stream conditions in subclause D.2.9.1.

The reporting accuracy of CQI under MIMO single stream conditions is
determined by the BLER performance when transmitting with a transport
format indicated by the reported CQI median determined over all single
transport block Type A CQI reports and all Type B CQI reports that were
reported together with PCI reports matching the precoding vector
embedded in the propagation channel as defined in subclause D.2.9.1.

The requirements and this test apply for Release 7 and later for all
types of UTRA for the FDD UE that support HSDPA UE capability categories
15 - 18.

The requirements and this test also apply for Release 8 and later for
all types of UTRA for the FDD UE that support HSDPA UE capability
categories 19 - 20.

#### 9.3.7A.2 Minimum requirements

For the parameters specified in Table 9.3.7A.1, and using the downlink
physical channels specified in table E.5.2, the requirements are
specified in terms of maximum BLERs at particular reported CQIs when
transmitting a fixed transport format given by the CQI median as shown
in Table 9.3.7A.2. The CQI median shall be determined over all single
transport block Type A CQI reports and all Type B CQI reports that were
reported together with PCI reports matching the precoding vector
embedded in the propagation channel as defined in subclause D.2.9.1. The
BLER at a particular reported CQI is obtained by associating a
particular CQI reference measurement period for all single transport
block Type A CQI reports and all Type B CQI reports that were reported
together with PCI reports matching the precoding vector embedded in the
propagation channel as defined in subclause D.2.9.1 with the HS-PDSCH
subframe overlapping with the end of this CQI reference measurement
period and calculating the fraction of erroneous HS-PDSCH subframes to
which the same CQI value was associated.

  CQI median       60%
  CQI median + 3   15%
  ---------------- --------------

The reference for this requirement is TS 25.101 \[1\] clause 9.3.4.1.

#### 9.3.7A.3 Test purpose

To verify that when using the TF based on the Median CQI that the BLER
for blocks associated with CQI reports of Median CQI is ≤ 60% and that
the BLER for blocks associated with CQI reports of Median CQI+3 is ≤
15%.

#### 9.3.7A.4 Method of test

##### 9.3.7A.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: normal; see clauses G.2.1 and G.2.2.

Frequencies to be tested: mid range; see clause G.2.4.

1\) Connect SS, multipath fading simulator and an AWGN noise source to
the UE antenna connector as shown in figure A.22.

2\) Set Ack/Nack handling at the SS such that regardless of the response
from the UE (Ack, Nack or DTX) new data is sent each time, this is
because HARQ transmissions are set to one, i.e. no re-transmission of
failed blocks. The sending of new data means that for each HARQ process
the new data indicator bit in the HS-SCCH toggles for consecutive
transmissions.

3\) Setup the fading simulators with fading conditions as described in
table D.2.9.1.

##### 9.3.7A.4.2 Procedure

1\) Set up an HSDPA call with looping back 12.2kbps RMC according to TS
34.108 \[3\] clause 7.3.6 with the exceptions for information elements
listed in table 9.3.7A.3 and exceptions in Annex I, with levels
according to table E.5.2. Set test conditions according to test 1
according table 9.3.7A.1. The configuration of the downlink channels is
defined in table E.5.2.

2\) The SS shall send TF according to CQI value 16 and keep it
regardless of the CQI value sent by the UE. Continue transmission of the
HS-PDSCH until 82000 CQI reports have been gathered. In this process the
SS collects CQI reports every 2 ms and also cases where UE transmits
nothing in its CQI field (CQI0) are counted as CQI reports.

3\) Set up a relative frequency distribution for the reported CQI values
that were reported together with PCI reports matching the precoding
vector embedded in the propagation channel as defined in subclause
D.2.9.1. Calculate the median value (Median CQI is the CQI that is at or
crosses 50% distribution from the lower CQI side). This CQI-value is
declared as Median CQI value.

4\) The SS shall transmit the TF according to the median-CQI value and
shall not react to the UE's reported CQI value. For any HSDPA block
transmitted by the SS, record the ACK, NACK and statDTX responses, and
associate with each response the CQI report that corresponds to the CQI
evaluation period in which the end of the HS-PDSCH is received. (See
figure 9.3.7A.1 below.)\
\
The responses are then filtered as follows: for the sequence of
responses for each HARQ process, discard all the statDTX responses. If
the number of consecutive discarded statDTX for any one process is an
odd number including one, also discard the next response for that HARQ
process regardless whether it is an ACK or NACK.\
Then filter the responses based on the PCI values. Keep only the
responses that have the PCI reports matching the precoding vector
embedded in the propagation channel as defined in subclause D.2.9.1.\
Continue to gather and filter responses until 1000 filtered responses
with CQI = Median CQI and 1000 filtered responses with CQI = Median CQI
+ 3 have been collected.

5\) Measure BLER as described below.

In the test there are two BLER requirements to be tested:

R1: HSDPA block with corresponding reported CQI = Median CQI BLER ≤ 60%

R2: HSDPA block with corresponding reported CQI = Median CQI + 3 BLER ≤
15%

BLER calculation

For each set of events R1 and R2 the BLER = (NACK) / (ACK + NACK)

#### 9.3.7A.5 Test Requirements

The measured BLER shall not exceed values specified in table 9.3.7A.2.

There are no parameters in the test setup or measurement process whose
variation impacts the results so there are no applicable test tolerances
for this test.

### 9.3.7B MIMO Dual Stream Fading Conditions

#### 9.3.7B.1 Definition and applicability

The minimum performance requirements of channel quality indicator (CQI)
reporting under MIMO dual stream conditions are defined based on a Type
A reporting fraction of 100%, i.e. the parameters *N*\_cqi\_typeA and
*M*\_cqi (see \[5\]) are assumed to be both set to 1. The propagation
conditions assumed for minimum performance requirements of CQI reporting
under MIMO dual stream conditions are defined in subcaluse D.2.9.2. The
precoding used at the transmitter is one randomly picked but fixed
precoding matrix for dual transport block transmission out of the set of
possible precoding matrices as defined in \[5\]. The same precoding
matrix shall be used to generate the resulting channel coefficients as
described for MIMO dual stream conditions in subcaluse D.2.9.2.

The reporting accuracy of CQI under MIMO dual stream conditions is
determined by the BLER performance of two streams of transport blocks
using the transport formats indicated by the respective stream specific
reported CQI median over all dual transport block CQI reports for each
stream that were reported together with PCI reports matching the
precoding matrix embedded in the propagation channel as defined in
subcaluse D.2.9.2.

The requirements and this test apply for Release 7 and later for all
types of UTRA for the FDD UE that support HSDPA UE capability categories
15 - 18.

The requirements and this test also apply for Release 8 and later for
all types of UTRA for the FDD UE that support HSDPA UE capability
categories 19 - 20.

#### 9.3.7B.2 Minimum requirements

For the parameters specified in Table 9.3.7B.1, and using the downlink
physical channels specified in table E.5.2, the requirements are
specified in terms of maximum BLERs at particular reported CQIs for each
stream when transmitting a fixed transport format per stream given by
the stream specific CQI median as shown in Table 9.3.7B.2. The stream
specific CQI median shall be determined over all dual transport block
CQI reports that were reported together with PCI reports matching the
precoding matrix embedded in the propagation channel as defined in
subcaluse D.2.9.2. When the reported preferred primary precoding vector
is matching with the first column of the precoding matrix embedded in
the propagation channel as defined in subcaluse D.2.9.2, the reported
values CQI~1~ and CQI~2~ shall be used respectively to determine the
median CQI values for stream \#1 and stream \#2 as depicted in Figure
D.2.9.2 in subclause D.2.9.2. When the reported preferred primary
precoding vector is matching with the second column of the precoding
matrix embedded in the propagation channel as defined in subclause
D.2.9.2, the reported values CQI~1~ and CQI~2~ shall be used to
determine the median CQI values for stream \#2 and stream \#1,
respectively. The stream specific BLER at a particular reported CQI is
obtained by associating a particular CQI reference measurement period
for all dual transport block CQI reports that were reported together
with a PCI report that was matching the precoding matrix embedded in the
propagation channel as defined in subclause D.2.9.2 with the two
transport blocks of the HS-PDSCH subframe overlapping with the end of
this CQI reference measurement period and calculating the fractions of
erroneous HS-PDSCH subframes to which the same CQI values were
associated.

fading conditions

  ---------------- --------------
  Reported CQI     Maximum BLER
                   Test 1
  CQI median       60%
  CQI median + 3   15%
  ---------------- --------------

The reference for this requirement is TS 25.101 \[1\] clause 9.3.4.2.

#### 9.3.7B.3 Test purpose

To verify that when using the TF based on the Median CQI that the BLER
for blocks associated with CQI reports of Median CQI is ≤ 60% and that
the BLER for blocks associated with CQI reports of Median CQI+3 is ≤
15%.

#### 9.3.7B.4 Method of test

##### 9.3.7B.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: normal; see clauses G.2.1 and G.2.2.

Frequencies to be tested: mid range; see clause G.2.4.

1\) Connect SS, multipath fading simulator and an AWGN noise source to
the UE antenna connector as shown in figure A.22.

2\) Set Ack/Nack handling at the SS such that regardless of the response
from the UE (Ack, Nack or DTX) new data is sent each time, this is
because HARQ transmissions are set to one, i.e. no re-transmission of
failed blocks. The sending of new data means that for each HARQ process
the new data indicator bit in the HS-SCCH toggles for consecutive
transmissions.

3\) Setup the fading simulators with fading conditions as described in
table D.2.9.2.

##### 9.3.7B.4.2 Procedure

1\) Set up an HSDPA call with looping back 12.2kbps RMC according to TS
34.108 \[3\] clause 7.3.6 with the exceptions for information elements
listed in table 9.3.7B.3 and exceptions in Annex I, with levels
according to table E.5.2. Set test conditions according to test 1
according table 9.3.7B.1. The configuration of the downlink channels is
defined in table E.5.2.

2\) For each stream, the SS shall send TF according to CQI value 7 and
keep it regardless of the CQI value sent by the UE. Continue
transmission of the HS-PDSCH until 82000 CQI reports have been gathered.
In this process the SS collects CQI reports every 2 ms and also cases
where UE transmits nothing in its CQI field (CQI0) are counted as CQI
reports.

3\) The stream specific CQI median shall be determined over all dual
transport block CQI reports that were reported together with PCI reports
matching the precoding matrix embedded in the propagation channel as
defined in subcaluse D.2.9.2. When the reported preferred primary
precoding vector is matching with the first column of the precoding
matrix embedded in the propagation channel as defined in subcaluse
D.2.9.2, the reported values CQI~1~ and CQI~2~ shall be used
respectively to determine the median CQI values for stream \#1 and
stream \#2 as depicted in Figure D.2.9.2 in subclause D.2.9.2. When the
reported preferred primary precoding vector is matching with the second
column of the precoding matrix embedded in the propagation channel as
defined in subclause D.2.9.2, the reported values CQI~1~ and CQI~2~
shall be used to determine the median CQI values for stream \#2 and
stream \#1, respectively. Set up a relative frequency distribution for
the reported CQI values for each stream. Calculate the median value
(Median CQI is the CQI that is at or crosses 50% distribution from the
lower CQI side). This CQI-value is declared as Median CQI value for that
stream.

4\) For each stream, the SS shall transmit the TF according to the
median-CQI value and shall not react to the UE's reported CQI value. For
each stream, for any HSDPA block transmitted by the SS, record the ACK,
NACK and statDTX responses, and associate with each response the CQI
report that corresponds to the CQI evaluation period in which the end of
the HS-PDSCH is received. (See figure 9.3.7B.1 below.)\
\
For each stream, the responses are then filtered as follows: for the
sequence of responses for each HARQ process, discard all the statDTX
responses. If the number of consecutive discarded statDTX for any one
process is an odd number including one, also discard the next response
for that HARQ process regardless whether it is an ACK or NACK.\
Then, for each stream, filter the responses based on the PCI values.
Keep only the responses that have the PCI reports matching the precoding
matrix embedded in the propagation channel as defined in subclause
D.2.9.2.\
Continue to gather and filter responses until 1000 filtered responses
with CQI = Median CQI and 1000 filtered responses with CQI = Median CQI
+ 3 have been collected.

5\) Measure BLER as described below for each stream.

In the test there are two BLER requirements to be tested:

R1: HSDPA block with corresponding reported CQI = Median CQI BLER ≤ 60%

R2: HSDPA block with corresponding reported CQI = Median CQI + 3 BLER ≤
15%

BLER calculation

For each set of events R1 and R2 the BLER = (NACK) / (ACK + NACK)

#### 9.3.7B.5 Test Requirements

For each stream, the measured BLER shall not exceed values specified in
table 9.3.7B.2.

There are no parameters in the test setup or measurement process whose
variation impacts the results so there are no applicable test tolerances
for this test.

### 9.3.7C MIMO Dual Stream Fading Conditions - UE categories 19-20

#### 9.3.7C.1 Definition and applicability

The minimum performance requirements of channel quality indicator (CQI)
reporting under MIMO dual stream conditions are defined based on a Type
A reporting fraction of 100%, i.e. the parameters *N*\_cqi\_typeA and
*M*\_cqi (see \[5\]) are assumed to be both set to 1. The propagation
conditions assumed for minimum performance requirements of CQI reporting
under MIMO dual stream conditions are defined in subclause D.2.9.2. The
precoding used at the transmitter is one randomly picked but fixed
precoding matrix for dual transport block transmission out of the set of
possible precoding matrices as defined in \[5\]. The same precoding
matrix shall be used to generate the resulting channel coefficients as
described for MIMO dual stream conditions in subclause D.2.9.2.

The reporting accuracy of CQI under MIMO dual stream conditions is
determined by the BLER performance of two streams of transport blocks
using the transport formats indicated by the respective stream specific
reported CQI median over all dual transport block CQI reports for each
stream that were reported together with PCI reports matching the
precoding matrix embedded in the propagation channel as defined in
subclause D.2.9.2.

The requirements and this test apply for Release 8 and later for all
types of UTRA for the FDD UE that support HSDPA UE capability categories
19and 20.

#### 9.3.7C.2 Minimum requirements

For the parameters specified in Table 9.3.7C.1, and using the downlink
physical channels specified in table E.5.2, the requirements are
specified in terms of maximum BLERs at particular reported CQIs for each
stream when transmitting a fixed transport format per stream given by
the stream specific CQI median as shown in Table 9.3.7C.2. The stream
specific CQI median shall be determined over all dual transport block
CQI reports that were reported together with PCI reports matching the
precoding matrix embedded in the propagation channel as defined in
subclause D.2.9.2. When the reported preferred primary precoding vector
is matching with the first column of the precoding matrix embedded in
the propagation channel as defined in subclause D.2.9.2, the reported
values CQI~1~ and CQI~2~ shall be used respectively to determine the
median CQI values for stream \#1 and stream \#2 as depicted in Figure
D.2.9.2 in subclause D.2.9.2. When the reported preferred primary
precoding vector is matching with the second column of the precoding
matrix embedded in the propagation channel as defined in subclause
D.2.9.2, the reported values CQI~1~ and CQI~2~ shall be used to
determine the median CQI values for stream \#2 and stream \#1,
respectively. The stream specific BLER at a particular reported CQI is
obtained by associating a particular CQI reference measurement period
for all dual transport block CQI reports that were reported together
with a PCI report that was matching the precoding matrix embedded in the
propagation channel as defined in subclause D.2.9.2 with the two
transport blocks of the HS-PDSCH subframe overlapping with the end of
this CQI reference measurement period and calculating the fractions of
erroneous HS-PDSCH subframes to which the same CQI values were
associated.

Table 9.3.7C.2: Minimum requirement for CQI test in MIMO dual stream
fading conditions

  ---------------- --------------
  Reported CQI     Maximum BLER
                   Test 1
  CQI median       60%
  CQI median + 2   15%
  ---------------- --------------

The reference for this requirement is TS 25.101 \[1\] clause 9.3.4.2.

#### 9.3.7C.3 Test purpose

To verify that when using the TF based on the Median CQI that the BLER
for blocks associated with CQI reports of Median CQI is ≤ 60% and that
the BLER for blocks associated with CQI reports of Median CQI+2 is ≤
15%.

#### 9.3.7C.4 Method of test

##### 9.3.7C.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: normal; see clauses G.2.1 and G.2.2.

Frequencies to be tested: mid range; see clause G.2.4.

1\. Connect SS, multipath fading simulator and an AWGN noise source to
the UE antenna connector as shown in figure A.22.

2\. Set Ack/Nack handling at the SS such that regardless of the response
from the UE (Ack, Nack or DTX) new data is sent each time, this is
because HARQ transmissions are set to one, i.e. no re-transmission of
failed blocks. The sending of new data means that for each HARQ process
the new data indicator bit in the HS-SCCH toggles for consecutive
transmissions.

3\. Setup the fading simulators with fading conditions as described in
table D.2.9.2.

##### 9.3.7C.4.2 Procedure

1\. Set up an HSDPA call with looping back 12.2kbps RMC according to TS
34.108 \[3\] clause 7.3.6 with the exceptions for information elements
listed in table 9.3.7C.3 and exceptions in Annex I, with levels
according to table E.5.2. Set test conditions according to test 1
according table 9.3.7C.1. The configuration of the downlink channels is
defined in table E.5.2.

2\. For each stream, the SS shall send TF according to CQI value 6 and
keep it regardless of the CQI value sent by the UE. Continue
transmission of the HS-PDSCH until 82000 CQI reports have been gathered.
In this process the SS collects CQI reports every 2 ms and also cases
where UE transmits nothing in its CQI field (CQI0) are counted as CQI
reports.

3\. The stream specific CQI median shall be determined over all dual
transport block CQI reports that were reported together with PCI reports
matching the precoding matrix embedded in the propagation channel as
defined in subcaluse D.2.9.2. When the reported preferred primary
precoding vector is matching with the first column of the precoding
matrix embedded in the propagation channel as defined in subcaluse
D.2.9.2, the reported values CQI~1~ and CQI~2~ shall be used
respectively to determine the median CQI values for stream \#1 and
stream \#2 as depicted in Figure D.2.9.2 in subclause D.2.9.2. When the
reported preferred primary precoding vector is matching with the second
column of the precoding matrix embedded in the propagation channel as
defined in subclause D.2.9.2, the reported values CQI~1~ and CQI~2~
shall be used to determine the median CQI values for stream \#2 and
stream \#1, respectively. Set up a relative frequency distribution for
the reported CQI values for each stream. Calculate the median value
(Median CQI is the CQI that is at or crosses 50% distribution from the
lower CQI side). This CQI-value is declared as Median CQI value for that
stream.

4\. For each stream, the SS shall transmit the TF according to the
median-CQI value and shall not react to the UE's reported CQI value. For
each stream, for any HSDPA block transmitted by the SS, record the ACK,
NACK and statDTX responses, and associate with each response the CQI
report that corresponds to the CQI evaluation period in which the end of
the HS-PDSCH is received. (See figure 9.3.7C.1 below.)\
\
For each stream, the responses are then filtered as follows: for the
sequence of responses for each HARQ process, discard all the statDTX
responses. If the number of consecutive discarded statDTX for any one
process is an odd number including one, also discard the next response
for that HARQ process regardless whether it is an ACK or NACK.\
Then, for each stream, filter the responses based on the PCI values.
Keep only the responses that have the PCI reports matching the precoding
matrix embedded in the propagation channel as defined in subclause
D.2.9.2.\
Continue to gather and filter responses until 1000 filtered responses
with CQI = Median CQI and 1000 filtered responses with CQI = Median CQI
+ 2 have been collected.

5\. Measure BLER as described below for each stream.

In the test there are two BLER requirements to be tested:

R1: HSDPA block with corresponding reported CQI = Median CQI BLER ≤ 60%

R2: HSDPA block with corresponding reported CQI = Median CQI + 2 BLER ≤
15%

Figure 9.3.7C.1: Combination of ACK/NACK message and the CQI report for
BLER calculation

For each set of events R1 and R2 the BLER = (NACK) / (ACK + NACK)

### 9.3.7D MIMO Dual Stream Static Orthogonal Conditions - UE categories 15-20

#### 9.3.7D.1 Definition and applicability

The minimum performance requirements of channel quality indicator (CQI)
reporting under MIMO dual stream conditions are defined based on a Type
A reporting fraction of 100%, i.e. the parameters *N*\_cqi\_typeA and
*M*\_cqi (see \[5\] are assumed to be both set to 1. The propagation
conditions assumed for minimum performance requirements of CQI reporting
under MIMO dual stream static orthogonal conditions are defined in
subclause D.2.9.3. The precoding matrix used in the transmitter shall be
one randomly picked but fixed precoding matrix
![](media/image1050.wmf){width="0.11944444444444445in"
height="0.11944444444444445in"}out of the set defined in equation as
defined in \[5\].

The requirements and this test apply for Release 8 and later for all
types of UTRA for the FDD UE that support HSDPA UE capability categories
15 to 20.

#### 9.3.7D.2 Minimum requirements

For the parameters specified in Table 9.3.7D.1, and using the downlink
physical channels specified in table E.5.2, the reported CQI value, for
each of the streams, shall be in the range of +/-2 of the reported
stream specific CQI median more than 90% of the time. The stream
specific CQI median shall be determined over all dual transport block
CQI reports.

For each of the streams, if the HS-PDSCH BLER using the transport format
indicated by the stream specific CQI median is less than or equal to
0.1, the BLER using the transport format indicated by the (stream
specific CQI median + 2) shall be greater than 0.1. For each of the
streams, if the HS-PDSCH BLER using the transport format indicated by
the stream specific CQI median is greater than 0.1, the BLER using
transport format indicated by (stream specific CQI median -1) shall be
less than or equal to 0.1.

+--------------------------+--------------+--------------------------+

The reference for this requirement is TS 25.101 \[1\] clause 9.3.4.3.1

#### 9.3.7D.3 Test purpose

To verify that the variance of the CQI reports when using TF based on
CQI 16 is within the limits defined and that a BLER of 10% falls between
the TF based on Median CQI-1 and the TF based on Median CQI TF or
between the TF based on Median CQI and the TF based on Median CQI+2 for
each stream.

#### 9.3.7D.4 Method of test

##### 9.3.7D.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: normal; see clauses G.2.1 and G.2.2.

Frequencies to be tested: mid range; see clause G.2.4.

1\. Connect SS, multipath fading simulator and an AWGN noise source to
the UE antenna connector as shown in figure A.22.

2\. Set Ack/Nack handling at the SS such that regardless of the response
from the UE (Ack, Nack or DTX) new data is sent each time, this is
because HARQ transmissions are set to one, i.e. no re-transmission of
failed blocks. The sending of new data means that for each HARQ process
the new data indicator bit in the HS-SCCH toggles for consecutive
transmissions.

##### 9.3.7D.4.2 Procedure

1\. Set up an HSDPA call with looping back 12.2kbps RMC according to TS
34.108 \[3\] clause 7.3.6 with the exceptions for information elements
listed in table 9.3.7D.2 and exceptions in Annex I, with levels
according to table E.5.2. Set test conditions according to test 1
according table 9.3.7D.1. The configuration of the downlink channels is
defined in table E.5.2.

NOTE: The following part of the procedure will test if the UE reports a
limited range of CQI values under the predefined channel conditions.

2\. For each stream, the SS shall send TF according to CQI value 7 and
keep it regardless of the CQI value sent by the UE. Continue
transmission of the HS-PDSCH until 2000 CQI reports have been gathered.
In this process the SS collects CQI reports every 2 ms and also cases
where UE transmits nothing in its CQI field (CQI0) are counted as CQI
reports.

3\. Set up a relative frequency distribution for the reported CQI values
for each stream. Calculate the median value (Median CQI is the CQI that
is at or crosses 50% distribution from the lower CQI side). This
CQI-value is declared as Median CQI value for that stream.

4\. For each stream, If 1800 or more of the CQI values are in the range
(Median CQI - 2) ≤ Median CQI ≤ (Median CQI + 2) then continue with step
5, otherwise fail the UE.

NOTE: The following part of the procedure will test if BLER versus CQI
has the correct sense.

5\. For each stream ,SS shall transmit the TF according to the
median-CQI value and shall not react to the UE's CQI reports. For each
stream, for any HSDPA block transmitted by the SS, record the associated
ACK, NACK and statDTX responses. The responses are then filtered as
follows: for the sequence of responses for each HARQ process, discard
all the statDTX responses. If the number of consecutive discarded
statDTX for any one process is an odd number including one, also discard
the next response for that HARQ process regardless whether it is an ACK
or NACK. Continue to gather data until the number of filtered ACK+NACK
responses reaches 1000.

For each stream, and for the filtered ACK and NACK responses if the
ratio ( NACK / ACK + NACK) \< 0.1 then goto step 6), otherwise goto step
7)

6\. The SS shall transmit the TF according to the median-CQI+2 value and
shall not react to the UE's CQIreports. For any HSDPA block, transmitted
by the SS, record and filter the ACK, NACK and statDTX responses as in
step 5 until 1000 filtered ACK+NACK responses are gathered.

If the ratio (NACK /ACK + NACK ) ≥ 0.1

then pass the UE, otherwise fail the UE

7\. The SS shall transmit the TF according to the median-CQI-1 value and
shall not react to the UE's CQI value. For any HSDPA block, transmitted
by the SS, record and filter the ACK, NACK and statDTX responses as in
step 5 until 1000 filtered ACK+NACK responses are gathered.

If the ratio ( NACK / ACK + NACK) \< 0.1

then pass the UE, otherwise fail the UE.

NOTE: The statistical selectivity based on 1000 samples is not
sufficient to distinguish between BLER \< 0.1 and \> 0.1. However, it is
assumed that the difference between\
\
\[true BLER on Median CQI - true BLER on (Median CQI + 2)\] and\
\[true BLER on Median CQI - true BLER on (Median CQI - 1)\]\
\
is large enough to exceed the statistical uncertainty and hence the
measurement can indicate the correct sense of BLER.

#### 9.3.7D.5 Test Requirements

Pass fail decision is as specified in the test procedure in 9.3.7D.4.2

There are no parameters in the test setup or measurement process whose
variation impacts the results so there are no applicable test tolerances
for this test.

### 9.3.7E MIMO Dual Stream Static Orthogonal Conditions - UE categories 19-20

#### 9.3.7E.1 Definition and applicability

The minimum performance requirements of channel quality indicator (CQI)
reporting under MIMO dual stream conditions are defined based on a Type
A reporting fraction of 100%, i.e. the parameters *N*\_cqi\_typeA and
*M*\_cqi (see \[5\]) \]) are assumed to be both set to 1. The
propagation conditions assumed for minimum performance requirements of
CQI reporting under MIMO dual stream static orthogonal conditions are
defined in subclause D.2.9.3. The precoding matrix used in the
transmitter shall be one randomly picked but fixed precoding matrix
![](media/image1050.wmf){width="0.11944444444444445in"
height="0.11944444444444445in"}out of the set defined in equation as
defined in \[5\].

The requirements and this test apply for Release 8 and later for all
types of UTRA for the FDD UE that support HSDPA UE capability categories
19 to 20.

#### 9.3.7E.2 Minimum requirements

For the parameters specified in Table 9.3.7E.1, and using the downlink
physical channels specified in table E.5.2, the reported CQI value, for
each of the streams, shall be in the range of +/-2 of the reported
stream specific CQI median more than 90% of the time. The stream
specific CQI median shall be determined over all dual transport block
CQI reports.

For each of the streams, if the HS-PDSCH BLER using the transport format
indicated by the stream specific CQI median is less than or equal to
0.1, the BLER using the transport format indicated by the (stream
specific CQI median + 2) shall be greater than 0.1. For each of the
streams, if the HS-PDSCH BLER using the transport format indicated by
the stream specific CQI median is greater than 0.1, the BLER using
transport format indicated by (stream specific CQI median -1) shall be
less than or equal to 0.1.

The reference for this requirement is TS 25.101 \[1\] clause 9.3.4.3.2

#### 9.3.7E.3 Test purpose

To verify that the variance of the CQI reports when using TF based on
CQI 16 is within the limits defined and that a BLER of 10% falls between
the TF based on Median CQI-1 and the TF based on Median CQI TF or
between the TF based on Median CQI and the TF based on Median CQI+2 for
each stream.

#### 9.3.7E.4 Method of test

##### 9.3.7E.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: normal; see clauses G.2.1 and G.2.2.

Frequencies to be tested: mid range; see clause G.2.4.

1\. Connect SS, multipath fading simulator and an AWGN noise source to
the UE antenna connector as shown in figure A.22.

2\. Set Ack/Nack handling at the SS such that regardless of the response
from the UE (Ack, Nack or DTX) new data is sent each time, this is
because HARQ transmissions are set to one, i.e. no re-transmission of
failed blocks. The sending of new data means that for each HARQ process
the new data indicator bit in the HS-SCCH toggles for consecutive
transmissions.

##### 9.3.7E.4.2 Procedure

1\. Set up an HSDPA call with looping back 12.2kbps RMC according to TS
34.108 \[3\] clause 7.3.6 with the exceptions for information elements
listed in table 9.3.7E.2 and exceptions in Annex I, with levels
according to table E.5.2. Set test conditions according to test 1
according table 9.3.7D.1. The configuration of the downlink channels is
defined in table E.5.2.

NOTE: The following part of the procedure will test if the UE reports a
limited range of CQI values under the predefined channel conditions.

2\. For each stream, the SS shall send TF according to CQI value 6 and
keep it regardless of the CQI value sent by the UE. Continue
transmission of the HS-PDSCH until 2000 CQI reports have been gathered.
In this process the SS collects CQI reports every 2 ms and also cases
where UE transmits nothing in its CQI field (CQI0) are counted as CQI
reports.

3\. Set up a relative frequency distribution for the reported CQI values
for each stream. Calculate the median value (Median CQI is the CQI that
is at or crosses 50% distribution from the lower CQI side). This
CQI-value is declared as Median CQI value for that stream.

4\. For each stream, If 1800 or more of the CQI values are in the range
(Median CQI - 2) ≤ Median CQI ≤ (Median CQI + 2) then continue with step
5, otherwise fail the UE.

NOTE: The following part of the procedure will test if BLER versus CQI
has the correct sense.

5\. For each stream ,SS shall transmit the TF according to the
median-CQI value and shall not react to the UE's CQI reports. For each
stream, for any HSDPA block transmitted by the SS, record the associated
ACK, NACK and statDTX responses. The responses are then filtered as
follows: for the sequence of responses for each HARQ process, discard
all the statDTX responses. If the number of consecutive discarded
statDTX for any one process is an odd number including one, also discard
the next response for that HARQ process regardless whether it is an ACK
or NACK. Continue to gather data until the number of filtered ACK+NACK
responses reaches 1000.

For each stream, and for the filtered ACK and NACK responses if the
ratio ( NACK / ACK + NACK) \< 0.1 then goto step 6), otherwise goto step
7)

6\. The SS shall transmit the TF according to the median-CQI+2 value and
shall not react to the UE's CQIreports. For any HSDPA block, transmitted
by the SS, record and filter the ACK, NACK and statDTX responses as in
step 5 until 1000 filtered ACK+NACK responses are gathered.

If the ratio (NACK /ACK + NACK ) ≥ 0.1

then pass the UE, otherwise fail the UE

7\. The SS shall transmit the TF according to the median-CQI-1 value and
shall not react to the UE's CQI value. For any HSDPA block, transmitted
by the SS, record and filter the ACK, NACK and statDTX responses as in
step 5 until 1000 filtered ACK+NACK responses are gathered.

If the ratio ( NACK / ACK + NACK) \< 0.1

then pass the UE, otherwise fail the UE.

NOTE: The statistical selectivity based on 1000 samples is not
sufficient to distinguish between BLER \< 0.1 and \> 0.1. However, it is
assumed that the difference between\
\
\[true BLER on Median CQI - true BLER on (Median CQI + 2)\] and\
\[true BLER on Median CQI - true BLER on (Median CQI - 1)\]\
\
is large enough to exceed the statistical uncertainty and hence the
measurement can indicate the correct sense of BLER.

#### 9.3.7E.5 Test Requirements

Pass fail decision is as specified in the test procedure in 9.3.7E.4.2

There are no parameters in the test setup or measurement process whose
variation impacts the results so there are no applicable test tolerances
for this test.

### 9.3.7F MIMO Single Stream Fading Conditions - Asymmetric CPICHs

#### 9.3.7F.1 Definition and applicability

The minimum performance requirements of channel quality indicator (CQI)
reporting under MIMO single stream conditions are defined based on a CQI
Type A versus Type B reporting ratio of 1/2, i.e. the parameters
*N*\_cqi\_typeA and *M*\_cqi (see \[5\]) are assumed to be set to 1 and
2, respectively. The propagation conditions assumed for minimum
performance requirements of CQI reporting under MIMO single stream
conditions are defined in subclause D.2.9.1. The precoding used at the
transmitter is one randomly picked but fixed precoding vector for single
transport block transmission out of the set of possible precoding
vectors as defined in \[5\]. The same precoding vector shall be used to
generate the resulting channel coefficients as described for MIMO single
stream conditions in subclause D.2.9.1.

The reporting accuracy of CQI under MIMO single stream conditions is
determined by the BLER performance when transmitting with a transport
format indicated by the reported CQI median determined over all single
transport block Type A CQI reports and all Type B CQI reports that were
reported together with PCI reports matching the precoding vector
embedded in the propagation channel as defined in subclause D.2.9.1.

The requirements and this test apply to Release 10 and later releases
for all types of UTRA for FDD UE that support HSDPA UE capability
categories 15-20.

NOTE: This test case can be optionally tested for Rel-7 and onward UE's
supporting MIMO feature.

#### 9.3.7F.2 Minimum requirements

For the parameters specified in Table 9.3.7F.1, and using the downlink
physical channels specified in table E.5.4D, the requirements are
specified in terms of maximum BLERs at particular reported CQIs when
transmitting a fixed transport format given by the CQI median as shown
in Table 9.3.7F.2. The CQI median shall be determined over all single
transport block Type A CQI reports and all Type B CQI reports that were
reported together with PCI reports matching the precoding vector
embedded in the propagation channel as defined in subclause D.2.9.1. The
BLER at a particular reported CQI is obtained by associating a
particular CQI reference measurement period for all single transport
block Type A CQI reports and all Type B CQI reports that were reported
together with PCI reports matching the precoding vector embedded in the
propagation channel as defined in subclause D.2.9.1 with the HS-PDSCH
subframe overlapping with the end of this CQI reference measurement
period and calculating the fraction of erroneous HS-PDSCH subframes to
which the same CQI value was associated.

conditions

  ---------------- --------------
  Reported CQI     Maximum BLER
                   Test 1
  CQI median       60%
  CQI median + 3   15%
  ---------------- --------------

The reference for this requirement is TS 25.101 \[1\] clause 9.3.4.1.

#### 9.3.7F.3 Test purpose

To verify that when using the TF based on the Median CQI that the BLER
for blocks associated with CQI reports of Median CQI is ≤ 60% and that
the BLER for blocks associated with CQI reports of Median CQI+3 is ≤
15%.

#### 9.3.7F.4 Method of test

##### 9.3.7F.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: normal; see clauses G.2.1 and G.2.2.

Frequencies to be tested: mid range; see clause G.2.4.

1\) Connect SS, multipath fading simulator and an AWGN noise source to
the UE antenna connector as shown in figure A.22.

2\) Set Ack/Nack handling at the SS such that regardless of the response
from the UE (Ack, Nack or DTX) new data is sent each time, this is
because HARQ transmissions are set to one, i.e. no re-transmission of
failed blocks. The sending of new data means that for each HARQ process
the new data indicator bit in the HS-SCCH toggles for consecutive
transmissions.

3\) Setup the fading simulators with fading conditions as described in
table D.2.9.1.

##### 9.3.7F.4.2 Procedure

1\) Set up an HSDPA call with looping back 12.2kbps RMC according to TS
34.108 \[3\] clause 7.3.6 with the exceptions for information elements
listed in table 9.3.7F.3 and exceptions in Annex I, with levels
according to table E.5.4D. Set test conditions according to test 1
according table 9.3.7F.1. The configuration of the downlink channels is
defined in table E.5.4D.

2\) The SS shall send TF according to CQI value 16 and keep it
regardless of the CQI value sent by the UE. Continue transmission of the
HS-PDSCH until 82000 CQI reports have been gathered. In this process the
SS collects CQI reports every 2 ms and also cases where UE transmits
nothing in its CQI field (CQI0) are counted as CQI reports.

3\) Set up a relative frequency distribution for the reported CQI values
that were reported together with PCI reports matching the precoding
vector embedded in the propagation channel as defined in subclause
D.2.9.1. Calculate the median value (Median CQI is the CQI that is at or
crosses 50% distribution from the lower CQI side). This CQI-value is
declared as Median CQI value.

4\) The SS shall transmit the TF according to the median-CQI value and
shall not react to the UE's reported CQI value. For any HSDPA block
transmitted by the SS, record the ACK, NACK and statDTX responses, and
associate with each response the CQI report that corresponds to the CQI
evaluation period in which the end of the HS-PDSCH is received. (See
figure 9.3.7F.1 below.)\
\
The responses are then filtered as follows: for the sequence of
responses for each HARQ process, discard all the statDTX responses. If
the number of consecutive discarded statDTX for any one process is an
odd number including one, also discard the next response for that HARQ
process regardless whether it is an ACK or NACK.\
Then filter the responses based on the PCI values. Keep only the
responses that have the PCI reports matching the precoding vector
embedded in the propagation channel as defined in subclause D.2.9.1.\
Continue to gather and filter responses until 1000 filtered responses
with CQI = Median CQI and 1000 filtered responses with CQI = Median CQI
+ 3 have been collected.

5\) Measure BLER as described below.

In the test there are two BLER requirements to be tested:

R1: HSDPA block with corresponding reported CQI = Median CQI BLER ≤ 60%

R2: HSDPA block with corresponding reported CQI = Median CQI + 3 BLER ≤
15%

Figure 9.3.7F.1: Combination of ACK/NACK message and the CQI report for
BLER calculation

For each set of events R1 and R2 the BLER = (NACK) / (ACK + NACK)

#### 9.3.7F.5 Test Requirements

The measured BLER shall not exceed values specified in table 9.3.7F.2.

There are no parameters in the test setup or measurement process whose
variation impacts the results so there are no applicable test tolerances
for this test.

### 9.3.7G MIMO Dual Stream Fading Conditions- Asymmetric CPICHs

#### 9.3.7G.1 Definition and applicability

The minimum performance requirements of channel quality indicator (CQI)
reporting under MIMO dual stream conditions are defined based on a Type
A reporting fraction of 100%, i.e. the parameters *N*\_cqi\_typeA and
*M*\_cqi (see \[5\]) are assumed to be both set to 1. The propagation
conditions assumed for minimum performance requirements of CQI reporting
under MIMO dual stream conditions are defined in subcaluse D.2.9.2. The
precoding used at the transmitter is one randomly picked but fixed
precoding matrix for dual transport block transmission out of the set of
possible precoding matrices as defined in \[5\]. The same precoding
matrix shall be used to generate the resulting channel coefficients as
described for MIMO dual stream conditions in subcaluse D.2.9.2.

The reporting accuracy of CQI under MIMO dual stream conditions is
determined by the BLER performance of two streams of transport blocks
using the transport formats indicated by the respective stream specific
reported CQI median over all dual transport block CQI reports for each
stream that were reported together with PCI reports matching the
precoding matrix embedded in the propagation channel as defined in
subcaluse D.2.9.2.

The requirements and this test apply to Release 10 and later releases
for all types of UTRA for FDD UE that support HSDPA UE capability
categories 15-20.

NOTE: This test case can be optionally tested for Rel-7 and onward UE's
supporting MIMO feature.

#### 9.3.7G.2 Minimum requirements

For the parameters specified in Table 9.3.7G.1, and using the downlink
physical channels specified in Table E.5.4D, the requirements are
specified in terms of maximum BLERs at particular reported CQIs for each
stream when transmitting a fixed transport format per stream given by
the stream specific CQI median as shown in Table 9.3.7G.2. The stream
specific CQI median shall be determined over all dual transport block
CQI reports that were reported together with PCI reports matching the
precoding matrix embedded in the propagation channel as defined in
subcaluse D.2.9.2. When the reported preferred primary precoding vector
is matching with the first column of the precoding matrix embedded in
the propagation channel as defined in subcaluse D.2.9.2, the reported
values CQI~1~ and CQI~2~ shall be used respectively to determine the
median CQI values for stream \#1 and stream \#2 as depicted in Figure
D.2.9.2 in subclause D.2.9.2. When the reported preferred primary
precoding vector is matching with the second column of the precoding
matrix embedded in the propagation channel as defined in subclause
D.2.9.2, the reported values CQI~1~ and CQI~2~ shall be used to
determine the median CQI values for stream \#2 and stream \#1,
respectively. The stream specific BLER at a particular reported CQI is
obtained by associating a particular CQI reference measurement period
for all dual transport block CQI reports that were reported together
with a PCI report that was matching the precoding matrix embedded in the
propagation channel as defined in subclause D.2.9.2 with the two
transport blocks of the HS-PDSCH subframe overlapping with the end of
this CQI reference measurement period and calculating the fractions of
erroneous HS-PDSCH subframes to which the same CQI values were
associated.

Table 9.3.7G.2: Minimum requirement for CQI test in MIMO dual stream
fading conditions

  ---------------- --------------
  Reported CQI     Maximum BLER
                   Test 1
  CQI median       60%
  CQI median + 3   15%
  ---------------- --------------

The reference for this requirement is TS 25.101 \[1\] clause 9.3.4.2.

#### 9.3.7G.3 Test purpose

To verify that when using the TF based on the Median CQI that the BLER
for blocks associated with CQI reports of Median CQI is ≤ 60% and that
the BLER for blocks associated with CQI reports of Median CQI+3 is ≤
15%.

#### 9.3.7G.4 Method of test

##### 9.3.7G.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: normal; see clauses G.2.1 and G.2.2.

Frequencies to be tested: mid range; see clause G.2.4.

1\) Connect SS, multipath fading simulator and an AWGN noise source to
the UE antenna connector as shown in figure A.22.

2\) Set Ack/Nack handling at the SS such that regardless of the response
from the UE (Ack, Nack or DTX) new data is sent each time, this is
because HARQ transmissions are set to one, i.e. no re-transmission of
failed blocks. The sending of new data means that for each HARQ process
the new data indicator bit in the HS-SCCH toggles for consecutive
transmissions.

3\) Setup the fading simulators with fading conditions as described in
table D.2.9.2.

##### 9.3.7G.4.2 Procedure

1\) Set up an HSDPA call with looping back 12.2kbps RMC according to TS
34.108 \[3\] clause 7.3.6 with the exceptions for information elements
listed in table 9.3.7G.3 and exceptions in Annex I, with levels
according to table E.5.4D. Set test conditions according to test 1
according table 9.3.7G.1. The configuration of the downlink channels is
defined in table E.5.4D.

2\) For each stream, the SS shall send TF according to CQI value 7 and
keep it regardless of the CQI value sent by the UE. Continue
transmission of the HS-PDSCH until 82000 CQI reports have been gathered.
In this process the SS collects CQI reports every 2 ms and also cases
where UE transmits nothing in its CQI field (CQI0) are counted as CQI
reports.

3\) The stream specific CQI median shall be determined over all dual
transport block CQI reports that were reported together with PCI reports
matching the precoding matrix embedded in the propagation channel as
defined in subcaluse D.2.9.2. When the reported preferred primary
precoding vector is matching with the first column of the precoding
matrix embedded in the propagation channel as defined in subcaluse
D.2.9.2, the reported values CQI~1~ and CQI~2~ shall be used
respectively to determine the median CQI values for stream \#1 and
stream \#2 as depicted in Figure D.2.9.2 in subclause D.2.9.2. When the
reported preferred primary precoding vector is matching with the second
column of the precoding matrix embedded in the propagation channel as
defined in subclause D.2.9.2, the reported values CQI~1~ and CQI~2~
shall be used to determine the median CQI values for stream \#2 and
stream \#1, respectively. Set up a relative frequency distribution for
the reported CQI values for each stream. Calculate the median value
(Median CQI is the CQI that is at or crosses 50% distribution from the
lower CQI side). This CQI-value is declared as Median CQI value for that
stream.

4\) For each stream, the SS shall transmit the TF according to the
median-CQI value and shall not react to the UE's reported CQI value. For
each stream, for any HSDPA block transmitted by the SS, record the ACK,
NACK and statDTX responses, and associate with each response the CQI
report that corresponds to the CQI evaluation period in which the end of
the HS-PDSCH is received. (See figure 9.3.7G.1 below.)\
\
For each stream, the responses are then filtered as follows: for the
sequence of responses for each HARQ process, discard all the statDTX
responses. If the number of consecutive discarded statDTX for any one
process is an odd number including one, also discard the next response
for that HARQ process regardless whether it is an ACK or NACK.\
Then, for each stream, filter the responses based on the PCI values.
Keep only the responses that have the PCI reports matching the precoding
matrix embedded in the propagation channel as defined in subclause
D.2.9.2.\
Continue to gather and filter responses until 1000 filtered responses
with CQI = Median CQI and 1000 filtered responses with CQI = Median CQI
+ 3 have been collected.

5\) Measure BLER as described below for each stream.

In the test there are two BLER requirements to be tested:

R1: HSDPA block with corresponding reported CQI = Median CQI BLER ≤ 60%

R2: HSDPA block with corresponding reported CQI = Median CQI + 3 BLER ≤
15%

Figure 9.3.7G.1: Combination of ACK/NACK message and the CQI report for
BLER calculation

For each set of events R1 and R2 the BLER = (NACK) / (ACK + NACK)

#### 9.3.7G.5 Test Requirements

For each stream, the measured BLER shall not exceed values specified in
table 9.3.7G.2.

There are no parameters in the test setup or measurement process whose
variation impacts the results so there are no applicable test tolerances
for this test.

### 9.3.7H MIMO Dual Stream Fading Conditions - UE categories 19-20 - Asymmetric CPICHs 

#### 9.3.7H.1 Definition and applicability

The minimum performance requirements of channel quality indicator (CQI)
reporting under MIMO dual stream conditions are defined based on a Type
A reporting fraction of 100%, i.e. the parameters *N*\_cqi\_typeA and
*M*\_cqi (see \[5\]) are assumed to be both set to 1. The propagation
conditions assumed for minimum performance requirements of CQI reporting
under MIMO dual stream conditions are defined in subclause D.2.9.2. The
precoding used at the transmitter is one randomly picked but fixed
precoding matrix for dual transport block transmission out of the set of
possible precoding matrices as defined in \[5\]. The same precoding
matrix shall be used to generate the resulting channel coefficients as
described for MIMO dual stream conditions in subclause D.2.9.2.

The reporting accuracy of CQI under MIMO dual stream conditions is
determined by the BLER performance of two streams of transport blocks
using the transport formats indicated by the respective stream specific
reported CQI median over all dual transport block CQI reports for each
stream that were reported together with PCI reports matching the
precoding matrix embedded in the propagation channel as defined in
subclause D.2.9.2.

The requirements and this test apply for Release 10 and later for all
types of UTRA for the FDD UE that support HSDPA UE capability categories
19and 20.

NOTE: This test case can be optionally tested for Rel-8 and onward UE's
supporting MIMO feature.

#### 9.3.7H.2 Minimum requirements

For the parameters specified in Table 9.3.7H.1, and using the downlink
physical channels specified in table E.5.4D, the requirements are
specified in terms of maximum BLERs at particular reported CQIs for each
stream when transmitting a fixed transport format per stream given by
the stream specific CQI median as shown in Table 9.3.7H.2. The stream
specific CQI median shall be determined over all dual transport block
CQI reports that were reported together with PCI reports matching the
precoding matrix embedded in the propagation channel as defined in
subclause D.2.9.2. When the reported preferred primary precoding vector
is matching with the first column of the precoding matrix embedded in
the propagation channel as defined in subclause D.2.9.2, the reported
values CQI~1~ and CQI~2~ shall be used respectively to determine the
median CQI values for stream \#1 and stream \#2 as depicted in Figure
D.2.9.2 in subclause D.2.9.2. When the reported preferred primary
precoding vector is matching with the second column of the precoding
matrix embedded in the propagation channel as defined in subclause
D.2.9.2, the reported values CQI~1~ and CQI~2~ shall be used to
determine the median CQI values for stream \#2 and stream \#1,
respectively. The stream specific BLER at a particular reported CQI is
obtained by associating a particular CQI reference measurement period
for all dual transport block CQI reports that were reported together
with a PCI report that was matching the precoding matrix embedded in the
propagation channel as defined in subclause D.2.9.2 with the two
transport blocks of the HS-PDSCH subframe overlapping with the end of
this CQI reference measurement period and calculating the fractions of
erroneous HS-PDSCH subframes to which the same CQI values were
associated.

Table 9.3.7H.2: Minimum requirement for CQI test in MIMO dual stream
fading conditions

  ---------------- --------------
  Reported CQI     Maximum BLER
                   Test 1
  CQI median       60%
  CQI median + 2   15%
  ---------------- --------------

The reference for this requirement is TS 25.101 \[1\] clause 9.3.4.2.

#### 9.3.7H.3 Test purpose

To verify that when using the TF based on the Median CQI that the BLER
for blocks associated with CQI reports of Median CQI is ≤ 60% and that
the BLER for blocks associated with CQI reports of Median CQI+2 is ≤
15%.

#### 9.3.7H.4 Method of test

##### 9.3.7H.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: normal; see clauses G.2.1 and G.2.2.

Frequencies to be tested: mid range; see clause G.2.4.

1\. Connect SS, multipath fading simulator and an AWGN noise source to
the UE antenna connector as shown in figure A.22.

2\. Set Ack/Nack handling at the SS such that regardless of the response
from the UE (Ack, Nack or DTX) new data is sent each time, this is
because HARQ transmissions are set to one, i.e. no re-transmission of
failed blocks. The sending of new data means that for each HARQ process
the new data indicator bit in the HS-SCCH toggles for consecutive
transmissions.

3\. Setup the fading simulators with fading conditions as described in
table D.2.9.2.

##### 9.3.7H.4.2 Procedure

1\. Set up an HSDPA call with looping back 12.2kbps RMC according to TS
34.108 \[3\] clause 7.3.6 with the exceptions for information elements
listed in table 9.3.7H.3 and exceptions in Annex I, with levels
according to table E.5.4D. Set test conditions according to test 1
according table 9.3.7H.1. The configuration of the downlink channels is
defined in table E.5.4D.

2\. For each stream, the SS shall send TF according to CQI value 6 and
keep it regardless of the CQI value sent by the UE. Continue
transmission of the HS-PDSCH until 82000 CQI reports have been gathered.
In this process the SS collects CQI reports every 2 ms and also cases
where UE transmits nothing in its CQI field (CQI0) are counted as CQI
reports.

3\. The stream specific CQI median shall be determined over all dual
transport block CQI reports that were reported together with PCI reports
matching the precoding matrix embedded in the propagation channel as
defined in subcaluse D.2.9.2. When the reported preferred primary
precoding vector is matching with the first column of the precoding
matrix embedded in the propagation channel as defined in subcaluse
D.2.9.2, the reported values CQI~1~ and CQI~2~ shall be used
respectively to determine the median CQI values for stream \#1 and
stream \#2 as depicted in Figure D.2.9.2 in subclause D.2.9.2. When the
reported preferred primary precoding vector is matching with the second
column of the precoding matrix embedded in the propagation channel as
defined in subclause D.2.9.2, the reported values CQI~1~ and CQI~2~
shall be used to determine the median CQI values for stream \#2 and
stream \#1, respectively. Set up a relative frequency distribution for
the reported CQI values for each stream. Calculate the median value
(Median CQI is the CQI that is at or crosses 50% distribution from the
lower CQI side). This CQI-value is declared as Median CQI value for that
stream.

4\. For each stream, the SS shall transmit the TF according to the
median-CQI value and shall not react to the UE's reported CQI value. For
each stream, for any HSDPA block transmitted by the SS, record the ACK,
NACK and statDTX responses, and associate with each response the CQI
report that corresponds to the CQI evaluation period in which the end of
the HS-PDSCH is received. (See figure 9.3.7H.1 below.)\
\
For each stream, the responses are then filtered as follows: for the
sequence of responses for each HARQ process, discard all the statDTX
responses. If the number of consecutive discarded statDTX for any one
process is an odd number including one, also discard the next response
for that HARQ process regardless whether it is an ACK or NACK.\
Then, for each stream, filter the responses based on the PCI values.
Keep only the responses that have the PCI reports matching the precoding
matrix embedded in the propagation channel as defined in subclause
D.2.9.2.\
Continue to gather and filter responses until 1000 filtered responses
with CQI = Median CQI and 1000 filtered responses with CQI = Median CQI
+ 2 have been collected.

5\. Measure BLER as described below for each stream.

In the test there are two BLER requirements to be tested:

R1: HSDPA block with corresponding reported CQI = Median CQI BLER ≤ 60%

R2: HSDPA block with corresponding reported CQI = Median CQI + 2 BLER ≤
15%

Figure 9.3.7H.1: Combination of ACK/NACK message and the CQI report for
BLER calculation

For each set of events R1 and R2 the BLER = (NACK) / (ACK + NACK)

#### 9.3.7H.5 Test Requirements

For each stream, the measured BLER shall not exceed values specified in
table 9.3.7H.2.

There are no parameters in the test setup or measurement process whose
variation impacts the results so there are no applicable test tolerances
for this test.

### 9.3.7I MIMO Dual Stream Static Orthogonal Conditions - UE categories 15-20 - Asymmetric CPICHs

#### 9.3.7I.1 Definition and applicability

The minimum performance requirements of channel quality indicator (CQI)
reporting under MIMO dual stream conditions are defined based on a Type
A reporting fraction of 100%, i.e. the parameters *N*\_cqi\_typeA and
*M*\_cqi (see \[5\] are assumed to be both set to 1. The propagation
conditions assumed for minimum performance requirements of CQI reporting
under MIMO dual stream static orthogonal conditions are defined in
subclause D.2.9.3. The precoding matrix used in the transmitter shall be
one randomly picked but fixed precoding matrix
![](media/image1050.wmf){width="0.12430555555555556in"
height="0.12569444444444444in"}out of the set defined in equation as
defined in \[5\].

The requirements and this test apply for Release 10 and later for all
types of UTRA for the FDD UE that support HSDPA UE capability categories
15 to 20.

NOTE: This test case can be optionally tested for Rel-8 and onward UE's
supporting MIMO feature.

#### 9.3.7I.2 Minimum requirements

For the parameters specified in Table 9.3.7I.1, and using the downlink
physical channels specified in table E.5.4D, the reported CQI value, for
each of the streams, shall be in the range of +/-2 of the reported
stream specific CQI median more than 90% of the time. The stream
specific CQI median shall be determined over all dual transport block
CQI reports.

For each of the streams, if the HS-PDSCH BLER using the transport format
indicated by the stream specific CQI median is less than or equal to
0.1, the BLER using the transport format indicated by the (stream
specific CQI median + 2) shall be greater than 0.1. For each of the
streams, if the HS-PDSCH BLER using the transport format indicated by
the stream specific CQI median is greater than 0.1, the BLER using
transport format indicated by (stream specific CQI median -1) shall be
less than or equal to 0.1.

The reference for this requirement is TS 25.101 \[1\] clause 9.3.4.3.1

#### 9.3.7I.3 Test purpose

To verify that the variance of the CQI reports when using TF based on
CQI 16 is within the limits defined and that a BLER of 10% falls between
the TF based on Median CQI-1 and the TF based on Median CQI TF or
between the TF based on Median CQI and the TF based on Median CQI+2 for
each stream.

#### 9.3.7I.4 Method of test

##### 9.3.7I.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: normal; see clauses G.2.1 and G.2.2.

Frequencies to be tested: mid range; see clause G.2.4.

1\. Connect SS, multipath fading simulator and an AWGN noise source to
the UE antenna connector as shown in figure A.22.

2\. Set Ack/Nack handling at the SS such that regardless of the response
from the UE (Ack, Nack or DTX) new data is sent each time, this is
because HARQ transmissions are set to one, i.e. no re-transmission of
failed blocks. The sending of new data means that for each HARQ process
the new data indicator bit in the HS-SCCH toggles for consecutive
transmissions.

##### 9.3.7I.4.2 Procedure

1\. Set up an HSDPA call with looping back 12.2kbps RMC according to TS
34.108 \[3\] clause 7.3.6 with the exceptions for information elements
listed in table 9.3.7I.2 and exceptions in Annex I, with levels
according to table E.5.4D. Set test conditions according to test 1
according table 9.3.7I.1. The configuration of the downlink channels is
defined in table E.5.4D.

NOTE: The following part of the procedure will test if the UE reports a
limited range of CQI values under the predefined channel conditions.

2\. For each stream, the SS shall send TF according to CQI value 7 and
keep it regardless of the CQI value sent by the UE. Continue
transmission of the HS-PDSCH until 2000 CQI reports have been gathered.
In this process the SS collects CQI reports every 2 ms and also cases
where UE transmits nothing in its CQI field (CQI0) are counted as CQI
reports.

3\. Set up a relative frequency distribution for the reported CQI values
for each stream. Calculate the median value (Median CQI is the CQI that
is at or crosses 50% distribution from the lower CQI side). This
CQI-value is declared as Median CQI value for that stream.

4\. For each stream, If 1800 or more of the CQI values are in the range
(Median CQI - 2) ≤ Median CQI ≤ (Median CQI + 2) then continue with step
5, otherwise fail the UE.

NOTE: The following part of the procedure will test if BLER versus CQI
has the correct sense.

5\. For each stream ,SS shall transmit the TF according to the
median-CQI value and shall not react to the UE's CQI reports. For each
stream, for any HSDPA block transmitted by the SS, record the associated
ACK, NACK and statDTX responses. The responses are then filtered as
follows: for the sequence of responses for each HARQ process, discard
all the statDTX responses. If the number of consecutive discarded
statDTX for any one process is an odd number including one, also discard
the next response for that HARQ process regardless whether it is an ACK
or NACK. Continue to gather data until the number of filtered ACK+NACK
responses reaches 1000.

For each stream, and for the filtered ACK and NACK responses if the
ratio ( NACK / ACK + NACK) \< 0.1 then goto step 6), otherwise goto step
7)

6\. The SS shall transmit the TF according to the median-CQI+2 value and
shall not react to the UE's CQIreports. For any HSDPA block, transmitted
by the SS, record and filter the ACK, NACK and statDTX responses as in
step 5 until 1000 filtered ACK+NACK responses are gathered.

If the ratio (NACK /ACK + NACK ) ≥ 0.1

then pass the UE, otherwise fail the UE

7\. The SS shall transmit the TF according to the median-CQI-1 value and
shall not react to the UE's CQI value. For any HSDPA block, transmitted
by the SS, record and filter the ACK, NACK and statDTX responses as in
step 5 until 1000 filtered ACK+NACK responses are gathered.

If the ratio ( NACK / ACK + NACK) \< 0.1

then pass the UE, otherwise fail the UE.

NOTE: The statistical selectivity based on 1000 samples is not
sufficient to distinguish between BLER \< 0.1 and \> 0.1. However, it is
assumed that the difference between\
\
\[true BLER on Median CQI - true BLER on (Median CQI + 2)\] and\
\[true BLER on Median CQI - true BLER on (Median CQI - 1)\]\
\
is large enough to exceed the statistical uncertainty and hence the
measurement can indicate the correct sense of BLER.

#### 9.3.7I.5 Test Requirements

Pass fail decision is as specified in the test procedure in 9.3.7I.4.2

There are no parameters in the test setup or measurement process whose
variation impacts the results so there are no applicable test tolerances
for this test.

### 9.3.7J MIMO Dual Stream Static Orthogonal Conditions - UE categories 19-20- Asymmetric CPICHs

#### 9.3.7J.1 Definition and applicability

The minimum performance requirements of channel quality indicator (CQI)
reporting under MIMO dual stream conditions are defined based on a Type
A reporting fraction of 100%, i.e. the parameters *N*\_cqi\_typeA and
*M*\_cqi (see \[5\]) \]) are assumed to be both set to 1. The
propagation conditions assumed for minimum performance requirements of
CQI reporting under MIMO dual stream static orthogonal conditions are
defined in subclause D.2.9.3. The precoding matrix used in the
transmitter shall be one randomly picked but fixed precoding matrix
![](media/image1050.wmf){width="0.12430555555555556in"
height="0.12569444444444444in"}out of the set defined in equation as
defined in \[5\].

The requirements and this test apply for Release 10 and later for all
types of UTRA for the FDD UE that support HSDPA UE capability categories
19 to 20.

NOTE: This test case can be optionally tested for Rel-8 and onward UE's
supporting MIMO feature.

#### 9.3.7J.2 Minimum requirements

For the parameters specified in Table 9.3.7J.1, and using the downlink
physical channels specified in table E.5.4D, the reported CQI value, for
each of the streams, shall be in the range of +/-2 of the reported
stream specific CQI median more than 90% of the time. The stream
specific CQI median shall be determined over all dual transport block
CQI reports.

For each of the streams, if the HS-PDSCH BLER using the transport format
indicated by the stream specific CQI median is less than or equal to
0.1, the BLER using the transport format indicated by the (stream
specific CQI median + 2) shall be greater than 0.1. For each of the
streams, if the HS-PDSCH BLER using the transport format indicated by
the stream specific CQI median is greater than 0.1, the BLER using
transport format indicated by (stream specific CQI median -1) shall be
less than or equal to 0.1.

transmission of the HS-PDSCH until 2000 CQI reports have been gathered.
In this process the SS collects CQI reports every 2 ms and also cases
where UE transmits nothing in its CQI field (CQI0) are counted as CQI
reports.

3\. Set up a relative frequency distribution for the reported CQI values
for each stream. Calculate the median value (Median CQI is the CQI that
is at or crosses 50% distribution from the lower CQI side). This
CQI-value is declared as Median CQI value for that stream.

4\. For each stream, If 1800 or more of the CQI values are in the range
(Median CQI - 2) ≤ Median CQI ≤ (Median CQI + 2) then continue with step
5, otherwise fail the UE.

NOTE: The following part of the procedure will test if BLER versus CQI
has the correct sense.

5\. For each stream ,SS shall transmit the TF according to the
median-CQI value and shall not react to the UE's CQI reports. For each
stream, for any HSDPA block transmitted by the SS, record the associated
ACK, NACK and statDTX responses. The responses are then filtered as
follows: for the sequence of responses for each HARQ process, discard
all the statDTX responses. If the number of consecutive discarded
statDTX for any one process is an odd number including one, also discard
the next response for that HARQ process regardless whether it is an ACK
or NACK. Continue to gather data until the number of filtered ACK+NACK
responses reaches 1000.

For each stream, and for the filtered ACK and NACK responses if the
ratio ( NACK / ACK + NACK) \< 0.1 then goto step 6), otherwise goto step
7)

6\. The SS shall transmit the TF according to the median-CQI+2 value and
shall not react to the UE's CQIreports. For any HSDPA block, transmitted
by the SS, record and filter the ACK, NACK and statDTX responses as in
step 5 until 1000 filtered ACK+NACK responses are gathered.

If the ratio (NACK /ACK + NACK ) ≥ 0.1

then pass the UE, otherwise fail the UE

7\. The SS shall transmit the TF according to the median-CQI-1 value and
shall not react to the UE's CQI value. For any HSDPA block, transmitted
by the SS, record and filter the ACK, NACK and statDTX responses as in
step 5 until 1000 filtered ACK+NACK responses are gathered.

If the ratio ( NACK / ACK + NACK) \< 0.1

then pass the UE, otherwise fail the UE.

NOTE: The statistical selectivity based on 1000 samples is not
sufficient to distinguish between BLER \< 0.1 and \> 0.1. However, it is
assumed that the difference between\
\
\[true BLER on Median CQI - true BLER on (Median CQI + 2)\] and\
\[true BLER on Median CQI - true BLER on (Median CQI - 1)\]\
\
is large enough to exceed the statistical uncertainty and hence the
measurement can indicate the correct sense of BLER.

#### 9.3.7J.5 Test Requirements

Pass fail decision is as specified in the test procedure in 9.3.7J.4.2

There are no parameters in the test setup or measurement process whose
variation impacts the results so there are no applicable test tolerances
for this test.

9.4 HS-SCCH Detection Performance
---------------------------------

### 9.4.1 Single Link Performance

#### 9.4.1.1 Definition and applicability

The detection performance of the HS-SCCH is determined by the
probability of event *E*~m~, which is declared when the UE is signalled
on HS-SCCH-1, but DTX is observed in the corresponding HS-DPCCH ACK/NACK
field. The probability of event *E*~m~ is denoted *P*(*E*~m~).

The requirements and this test apply to all types of UTRA for FDD UE
that support HSDPA.

#### 9.4.1.2 Minimum requirements

For the parameters specified in Table 9.4.1.1, for each value of
HS-SCCH-1 *E*~c~/*I*~or~ specified in Table 9.4.1.2 the measured
*P*(*E*~m~) shall be less than or equal to the corresponding specified
value of *P*(*E*~m~).

#### 9.4.1.3 Test purpose

To verify that *P*(*E*~m~) does not exceed the limit in table 9.4.1.2.

#### 9.4.1.4 Method of test

##### 9.4.1.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: normal; see clauses G.2.1 and G.2.2.

Frequencies to be tested: mid range; see clause G.2.4.

1\. Connect SS, multipath fading simulator and an AWGN noise source to
the UE antenna connector as shown in figure A.21 for UEs that support
receive diversity or figure A.10 for UEs that do not support receive
diversity.

2\. Set the test parameters for test 1-3 as specified in table 9.4.1.3
and 9.4.1.4. Setup fading simulators as fading condition, which are
described in table D.2.2.1A.

##### 9.4.1.4.2 Procedure

1\. The UE is switched on.

2\. Set up a HSDPA connection with looping back 12.2kbps RMC according
to the generic HSDPA set-up procedure specified in TS 34.108 \[3\] sub
clause 7.3.6 with levels according to table E.5.0.

3\. Once the HSDPA connection is setup, change levels according to Table
E.5.4 and start transmitting HSDPA Data.

4\. Count the number of NACK, ACK and statDTX on the UL HS-DPCCH during
the test interval and decide pass or fail according to Annex F.6.1 and
table F.6.1.8. NACK and ACK are counted as a pass and statDTX is counted
as a failure.

#### 9.4.1.5 Test Requirements

Tables 9.4.1.3. and 9.4.1.4 define the primary level settings including
test tolerance and test parameters for relevant tests. The probability
of event *E*~m~ denoted as *P*(*E*~m~) (test procedure step 3) shall not
exceed the specified value in table 9.4.1.4. The pass/fail decision is
done according to Annex F.6.1.

Tolerance for this test is defined in clause F.2 and the explanation of
how the Minimum Requirement has been relaxed by the Test Tolerance is
given in clause F.4

### 9.4.1A Single Link Performance - Enhanced Performance Requirements Type 1

#### 9.4.1A.1 Definition and applicability

The detection performance of the HS-SCCH is determined by the
probability of event *E*~m~, which is declared when the UE is signalled
on HS-SCCH-1, but DTX is observed in the corresponding HS-DPCCH ACK/NACK
field. The probability of event *E*~m~ is denoted *P*(*E*~m~).

The requirements and this test apply for Release 6 and later to all
types of UTRA for FDD UE that support HSDPA and the optional enhanced
performance requirements type 1.

The requirements and this test apply also for Release 7 and later to all
types of UTRA for FDD UE that support HSDPA and the optional enhanced
performance requirements type 3.

The requirements and this test apply also for Release 8 and later to all
types of UTRA for FDD UE that support HSDPA and the optional enhanced
performance requirements type 3i.

#### 9.4.1A.2 Minimum requirements

For the parameters specified in Table 9.4.1A.1, for each value of
HS-SCCH-1 *E*~c~/*I*~or~ specified in Table 9.4.1A.2 the measured
*P*(*E*~m~) shall be less than or equal to the corresponding specified
value of *P*(*E*~m~).

The reference for this requirement is TS 25.101 \[1\] clause 9.4.1.

#### 9.4.1A.3 Test purpose

To verify that *P*(*E*~m~) does not exceed the limit in table 9.4.1A.2.

#### 9.4.1A.4 Method of test

##### 9.4.1A.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: normal; see clauses G.2.1 and G.2.2.

Frequencies to be tested: mid range; see clause G.2.4.

1\. Connect SS, multipath fading simulators and AWGN noise sources to
the UE antenna connector(s) as shown in figure A.21 for UEs that support
receive diversity or figure A.10 for UEs that do not support receive
diversity.

2\. Set the test parameters for test 1-2 as specified in table 9.4.1A.3
and 9.4.1A.4. Setup fading simulators as fading condition, which are
described in table D.2.2.1A and for UEs that support receive diversity
as also described in clause D.2.5.

##### 9.4.1A.4.2 Procedure

1\. The UE is switched on.

2\. Set up a HSDPA connection with looping back 12.2kbps RMC according
to the generic HSDPA set-up procedure specified in TS 34.108 \[3\] sub
clause 7.3.6 with levels according to table E.5.0.

3\. Once the HSDPA connection is setup, change levels according to Table
E.5.4 and start transmitting HSDPA Data.

4\. Count the number of NACK, ACK and statDTX on the UL HS-DPCCH during
the test interval and decide pass or fail according to Annex F.6.1 and
table F.6.1.8. NACK and ACK are counted as a pass and statDTX is counted
as a failure.

#### 9.4.1A.5 Test Requirements

Tables 9.4.1A.3. and 9.4.1A.4 define the primary level settings
including test tolerance and test parameters for relevant tests. The
probability of event *E*~m~ denoted as *P*(*E*~m~) (test procedure step
3) shall not exceed the specified value in table 9.4.1A.4. The pass/fail

NOTE: If the above Test Requirement differs from the Minimum Requirement
then the Test Tolerance applied for this test is non-zero. The Test
Tolerance for this test is defined in clause F.2 and the explanation of
how the Minimum Requirement has been relaxed by the Test Tolerance is
given in clause F.4.

### 9.4.2 Open Loop Diversity Performance

#### 9.4.2.1 Definition and applicability

The detection performance of the HS-SCCH is determined by the
probability of event *E*~m~, which is declared when the UE is signalled
on HS-SCCH-1, but DTX is observed in the corresponding HS-DPCCH ACK/NACK
field. The probability of event *E*~m~ is denoted *P*(*E*~m~).

The requirements and this test apply for Release 6 and later to all
types of UTRA for FDD UE that support HSDPA.

#### 9.4.2.2 Minimum requirements

For the test parameters specified in Table 9.4.2.1, for each value of
HS-SCCH-1 *E*~c~/*I*~or~ specified in Table 9.4.2.2 the measured
*P*(*E*~m~) shall be less than or equal to the corresponding specified
value of *P*(*E*~m~).

The reference for this requirement is TS 25.101 \[1\] clause 9.4.2.

#### 9.4.2.3 Test purpose

To verify that *P*(*E*~m~) does not exceed the limit in table 9.4.2.2.

#### 9.4.2.4 Method of test

##### 9.4.2.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: normal; see clauses G.2.1 and G.2.2.

Frequencies to be tested: mid range; see clause G.2.4.

1\. Connect SS, multipath fading simulators and AWGN noise sources to
the UE antenna connector as shown in figure A.22 for UEs that support
receive diversity or figure A.12 for UEs that do not support receive
diversity.

2\. Set the test parameters for test 1-3 as specified in table 9.4.2.4
and 9.4.2.5. Setup fading simulators as fading condition, which are
described in table D.2.2.1A and clause D.2.7.

##### 9.4.2.4.2 Procedure

1\. The UE is switched on.

2\. Set up a HSDPA connection with looping back 12.2kbps RMC according
to the generic HSDPA set-up procedure specified in TS 34.108 \[3\] sub
clause 7.3.6 with the exceptions for information elements listed in
table 9.4.2.3, with levels according to table E.5.0.

3\. Once the HSDPA connection is setup, change levels according to Table
E.5.4A and start transmitting HSDPA Data.

4\. Count the number of NACK, ACK and statDTX on the UL HS-DPCCH during
the test interval and decide pass or fail according to Annex F.6.1 and
table F.6.1.8. NACK and ACK are counted as a pass and statDTX is counted
as a failure.

NOTE: If the above Test Requirement differs from the Minimum Requirement
then the Test Tolerance applied for this test is non-zero. The Test
Tolerance for this test is defined in clause F.2 and the explanation of
how the Minimum Requirement has been relaxed by the Test Tolerance is
given in clause F.4.

### 9.4.2A Open Loop Diversity Performance - Enhanced Performance Requirements Type 1

#### 9.4.2A.1 Definition and applicability

The detection performance of the HS-SCCH is determined by the
probability of event *E*~m~, which is declared when the UE is signalled
on HS-SCCH-1, but DTX is observed in the corresponding HS-DPCCH ACK/NACK
field. The probability of event *E*~m~ is denoted *P*(*E*~m~).

The requirements and this test apply for Release 6 and later to all
types of UTRA for FDD UE that support HSDPA and the optional enhanced
performance requirements type 1.

The requirements and this test apply also for Release 7 and later to all
types of UTRA for FDD UE that support HSDPA and the optional enhanced
performance requirements type 3.

The requirements and this test apply also for Release 8 and later to all
types of UTRA for FDD UE that support HSDPA and the optional enhanced
performance requirements type 3i.

#### 9.4.2A.2 Minimum requirements

For the test parameters specified in Table 9.4.2A.1, for each value of
HS-SCCH-1 *E*~c~/*I*~or~ specified in Table 9.4.2A.2 the measured
*P*(*E*~m~) shall be less than or equal to the corresponding specified
value of *P*(*E*~m~).

The reference for this requirement is TS 25.101 \[1\] clause 9.4.2.

#### 9.4.2A.3 Test purpose

To verify that *P*(*E*~m~) does not exceed the limit in table 9.4.2A.2.

#### 9.4.2A.4 Method of test

##### 9.4.2A.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: normal; see clauses G.2.1 and G.2.2.

Frequencies to be tested: mid range; see clause G.2.4.

1\. Connect SS, multipath fading simulator and an AWGN noise source to
the UE antenna connector as shown in figure A.22 for UEs that support
receive diversity or figure A.12 for UEs that do not support receive
diversity.

2\. Set the test parameters for test 1-2 as specified in table 9.4.2A.4
and 9.4.2A.5. Setup fading simulators as fading condition, which are
described in table D.2.2.1A and clause D.2.5. The configuration of the
downlink channels is defined in table E.5.4A.

##### 9.4.2A.4.2 Procedure

1\. The UE is switched on.

2\. Set up a HSDPA connection with looping back 12.2kbps RMC according
to the generic HSDPA set-up procedure specified in TS 34.108 \[3\] sub
clause 7.3.6 with the exceptions for information elements listed in
table 9.4.2A.3, with levels according to table E.5.0.

3\. Once the HSDPA connection is setup, change levels according to Table
E.5.4A and start transmitting HSDPA Data.

4\. Count the number of NACK, ACK and statDTX on the UL HS-DPCCH during
the test interval and decide pass or fail according to Annex F.6.1 and
table F.6.1.8. NACK and ACK are counted as a pass and statDTX is counted
as a failure.

NOTE: If the above Test Requirement differs from the Minimum Requirement
then the Test Tolerance applied for this test is non-zero. The Test
Tolerance for this test is defined in clause F.2 and the explanation of
how the Minimum Requirement has been relaxed by the Test Tolerance is
given in clause F.4.

### 9.4.3 HS-SCCH Type 3 Performance

#### 9.4.3.1 Definition and applicability

The detection performance of the HS-SCCH is determined by the
probability of event *E*~m~, which is declared when the UE is signalled
on HS-SCCH-1, but DTX is observed in the corresponding HS-DPCCH ACK/NACK
field. The probability of event *E*~m~ is denoted *P*(*E*~m~).

The requirements and this test apply for Release 7 and later for all
types of UTRA for the FDD UE that support HSDPA UE capability categories
15 - 18.

#### 9.4.3.2 Minimum requirements

For the test parameters specified in Table 9.4.3.1 with the downlink
physical channel setup in Table E.5.4A, for each value of HS-SCCH-1
*E*~c~/*I*~or~ specified in Table 9.4.3.2 and Table 9.4.3.3 the measured
*P*(*E*~m~) shall be less than or equal to the corresponding specified
value of *P*(*E*~m~). The requirements in Table 9.4.3.2 and Table
9.4.3.3 assume STTD is enabled on HS-SCCH and DPCH. The requirements in
Table 9.4.3.2 assumes HS-SCCH Type 3 coding associated with single
stream transmission on HS-DSCH. The requirements in Table 9.4.3.3
assumes HS-SCCH Type 3 coding associated with dual stream transmission
on HS-DSCH. Minimum performance requirements specified in Table 9.4.3.2
and 9.4.3.3 are based on receiver diversity.

The reference for this requirement is TS 25.101 \[1\] clause 9.4.3.

#### 9.4.3.3 Test purpose

To verify that *P*(*E*~m~) does not exceed the limit in table 9.4.3.2
for the single transport block case, and in table 9.4.3.3 for the dual
transport block case.

#### 9.4.3.4 Method of test

##### 9.4.3.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: normal; see clauses G.2.1 and G.2.2.

Frequencies to be tested: mid range; see clause G.2.4.

1\) Connect SS, multipath fading simulator and an AWGN noise source to
the UE antenna connector as shown in figure A.22.

2\) Set the test parameters for test 1-4 as specified in table 9.4.3.5.
Setup fading simulators as fading condition, which are described in
table s D.2.2.1A and D.2.2.1C and clause D.2. The configuration of the
downlink channels is defined in table E.5.4A.

##### 9.4.3.4.2 Procedure

1\. The UE is switched on.

2\. Set up a HSDPA connection with looping back 12.2kbps RMC according
to the generic HSDPA set-up procedure specified in TS 34.108 \[3\] sub
clause 7.3.6 with the exceptions for information elements listed in
table 9.4.3.4, with levels according to table E.5.0.

3\. Once the HSDPA connection is setup, change levels according to Table
E.5.4A and start transmitting HSDPA Data.

4\. Count the number of NACK, ACK and statDTX on the UL HS-DPCCH during
the test interval and decide pass or fail according to Annex F.6.1 and
table F.6.1.8. NACK and ACK are counted as a pass and statDTX is counted
as a failure.

NOTE: If the above Test Requirement differs from the Minimum Requirement
then the Test Tolerance applied for this test is non-zero. The Test
Tolerance for this test is defined in clause F.2 and the explanation of
how the Minimum Requirement has been relaxed by the Test Tolerance is
given in clause F.4.

### 9.4.3A HS-SCCH Type 3 Performance -STTD disabled- Asymmetric CPICHs

#### 9.4.3A.1 Definition and applicability

The detection performance of the HS-SCCH is determined by the
probability of event *E*~m~, which is declared when the UE is signalled
on HS-SCCH-1, but DTX is observed in the corresponding HS-DPCCH ACK/NACK
field. The probability of event *E*~m~ is denoted *P*(*E*~m~).

The requirements and this test apply for Release 10 and later for all
types of UTRA for the FDD UE that support HSDPA UE capability categories
15 - 20.

NOTE: This test case can be optionally executed for Rel-7 and onward
UE's supporting MIMO feature.

#### 9.4.3A.2 Minimum requirements

For the test parameters specified in Table 9.4.3A.1 with the downlink
physical channel setup in Table E.5.4E, for each value of HS-SCCH-1
*E*~c~/*I*~or~ specified in Table 9.4.3A.2 and Table 9.4.3A.3 the
measured *P*(*E*~m~) shall be less than or equal to the corresponding
specified value of *P*(*E*~m~). The requirements in Table 9.4.3A.2 and
Table 9.4.3A.3 assume STTD is disabled on HS-SCCH and DPCH. The
requirements in Table 9.4.3A.2 assumes HS-SCCH Type 3 coding associated
with single stream transmission on HS-DSCH. The requirements in Table
9.4.3A.3 assumes HS-SCCH Type 3 coding associated with dual stream
transmission on HS-DSCH. Minimum performance requirements specified in
Table 9.4.3A.2 and 9.4.3A.3 are based on receiver diversity.

The reference for this requirement is TS 25.101 \[1\] clause 9.4.3.

#### 9.4.3A.3 Test purpose

To verify that *P*(*E*~m~) does not exceed the limit in table 9.4.3A.2
for the single transport block case, and in table 9.4.3A.3 for the dual
transport block case.

#### 9.4.3A.4 Method of test

##### 9.4.3A.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: normal; see clauses G.2.1 and G.2.2.

Frequencies to be tested: mid range; see clause G.2.4.

1\) Connect SS, multipath fading simulator and an AWGN noise source to
the UE antenna connector as shown in figure A.22.

2\) Set the test parameters for test 1-4 as specified in table 9.4.3A.5.
Setup fading simulators as fading condition, which are described in
table s D.2.2.1A and D.2.2.1C and clause D.2. The configuration of the
downlink channels is defined in table E.5.4E.

9.4.3A.4.2 Procedure

1\. The UE is switched on.

2\. Set up a HSDPA connection with looping back 12.2kbps RMC according
to the generic HSDPA set-up procedure specified in TS 34.108 \[3\] sub
clause 7.3.6 with the exceptions for information elements listed in
table 9.4.3A.4, with levels according to table E.5.0.

3\. Once the HSDPA connection is setup, change levels according to Table
E.5.4E and start transmitting HSDPA Data.

4\. Count the number of NACK, ACK and statDTX on the UL HS-DPCCH during
the test interval and decide pass or fail according to Annex F.6.1 and
table F.6.1.8. NACK and ACK are counted as a pass and statDTX is counted
as a failure.

how the Minimum Requirement has been relaxed by the Test Tolerance is
given in clause F.4.

### 9.4.3B HS-SCCH Type 3 Performance -STTD enabled- Asymmetric CPICHs

#### 9.4.3B.1 Definition and applicability

The detection performance of the HS-SCCH is determined by the
probability of event *E*~m~, which is declared when the UE is signalled
on HS-SCCH-1, but DTX is observed in the corresponding HS-DPCCH ACK/NACK
field. The probability of event *E*~m~ is denoted *P*(*E*~m~).

The requirements and this test apply for HSDPA UE capability categories
15 - 20 and Release 10 and later for all types of UTRA for the FDD UE's
supporting TX Diversity on DL Control Channels by MIMO Capable UE when
MIMO operation is active

NOTE: This test case can be optionally executed for Rel-7 and onward
UE's supporting MIMO feature.

#### 9.4.3B.2 Minimum requirements

For the test parameters specified in Table 9.4.3B.1 with the downlink
physical channel setup in Table E.5.4E, for each value of HS-SCCH-1
*E*~c~/*I*~or~ specified in Table 9.4.3B.2 and Table 9.4.3B.3 the
measured *P*(*E*~m~) shall be less than or equal to the corresponding
specified value of *P*(*E*~m~). The requirements in Table 9.4.3B.2 and
Table 9.4.3B.3 assume STTD is enabled on HS-SCCH and DPCH. The
requirements in Table 9.4.3B.2 assumes HS-SCCH Type 3 coding associated
with single stream transmission on HS-DSCH. The requirements in Table
9.4.3B.3 assumes HS-SCCH Type 3 coding associated with dual stream
transmission on HS-DSCH. Minimum performance requirements specified in
Table 9.4.3B.2 and 9.4.3B.3 are based on receiver diversity.

The reference for this requirement is TS 25.101 \[1\] clause 9.4.3.

#### 9.4.3B.3 Test purpose

To verify that *P*(*E*~m~) does not exceed the limit in table 9.4.3B.2
for the single transport block case, and in table 9.4.3B.3 for the dual
transport block case.

#### 9.4.3B.4 Method of test

#### 9.4.3B.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: normal; see clauses G.2.1 and G.2.2.

Frequencies to be tested: mid range; see clause G.2.4.

1\) Connect SS, multipath fading simulator and an AWGN noise source to
the UE antenna connector as shown in figure A.22.

2\) Set the test parameters for test 1-4 as specified in table 9.4.3B.5.
Setup fading simulators as fading condition, which are described in
table s D.2.2.1A and D.2.2.1C and clause D.2. The configuration of the
downlink channels is defined in table E.5.4E.

#### 9.4.3B.4.2 Procedure

1\. The UE is switched on.

2\. Set up a HSDPA connection with looping back 12.2kbps RMC according
to the generic HSDPA set-up procedure specified in TS 34.108 \[3\] sub
clause 7.3.6 with the exceptions for information elements listed in
table 9.4.3B.4, with levels according to table E.5.0.

3\. Once the HSDPA connection is setup, change levels according to Table
E.5.4E and start transmitting HSDPA Data.

4\. Count the number of NACK, ACK and statDTX on the UL HS-DPCCH during
the test interval and decide pass or fail according to Annex F.6.1 and
table F.6.1.8. NACK and ACK are counted as a pass and statDTX is counted
as a failure.

NOTE: If the above Test Requirement differs from the Minimum Requirement
then the Test Tolerance applied for this test is non-zero. The Test
Tolerance for this test is defined in clause F.2 and the explanation of
how the Minimum Requirement has been relaxed by the Test Tolerance is
given in clause F.4.

### 9.4.4 HS-SCCH Type 3 Performance for MIMO only with single-stream restriction

#### 9.4.4.1 Definition and applicability

The detection performance of the HS-SCCH for MIMO only with
single-stream restriction is determined by the probability of event
*E*~m~, which is declared when the UE is signalled on HS-SCCH-1, but DTX
is observed in the corresponding HS-DPCCH ACK/NACK field. The
probability of event *E*~m~ is denoted *P*(*E*~m~).

The requirements and this test apply for Release 10 and later for all
types of UTRA for the FDD UE that support the optional MIMO only with
single stream restriction.

NOTE: This test case can be optionally tested for Rel-7 and onward UE's
supporting MIMO feature.

#### 9.4.4.2 Minimum requirements

For the test parameters specified in Table 9.4.4.1 with the downlink
physical channel setup in Table E.5.4A, for each value of HS-SCCH-1
*E*~c~/*I*~or~ specified in Table 9.4.4.2 the measured *P*(*E*~m~) shall
be less than or equal to the corresponding specified value of
*P*(*E*~m~). The requirements in Table 9.4.4.2 assume STTD is enabled on
HS-SCCH and DPCH. The requirements in Table 9.4.4.2 assume HS-SCCH Type
3 coding associated with single stream transmission on HS-DSCH.

#### 9.4.4.4 Method of test

##### 9.4.4.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: normal; see clauses G.2.1 and G.2.2.

Frequencies to be tested: mid range; see clause G.2.4.

1\) Connect SS, multipath fading simulator and an AWGN noise source to
the UE antenna connector as shown in figure A.22 for UEs that support
receive diversity or figure A.12 for UEs that do not support receive
diversity.

2\) Set the test parameters for test 1-2 as specified in Table 9.4.4.5.
Setup the fading simulators as fading condition, which are described in
table s D.2.2.1A and D.2.2.1C and clause D.2. The configuration of the
downlink channels is defined in Table E.5.4A.

##### 9.4.4.4.2 Procedure

1\. The UE is switched on.

2\. Set up a HSDPA connection with looping back 12.2kbps RMC according
to the generic HSDPA set-up procedure specified in TS 34.108 \[3\] sub
clause 7.3.6 with the exceptions for information elements listed in
Table 9.4.4.4, with levels according to Table E.5.0.

3\. Once the HSDPA connection is setup, change levels according to Table
E.5.4A and start transmitting HSDPA Data.

4\. Count the number of NACK, ACK and statDTX on the UL HS-DPCCH during
the test interval and decide pass or fail according to Annex F.6.1 and
Table F.6.1.8. NACK and ACK are counted as a pass and statDTX is counted
as a failure.

### 9.4.4A HS-SCCH Type 3 Performance for MIMO only with single-stream restriction- Enhanced Performance Requirements Type 1

#### 9.4.4A.1 Definition and applicability

The detection performance of the HS-SCCH for MIMO only with
single-stream restriction is determined by the probability of event
*E*~m~, which is declared when the UE is signalled on HS-SCCH-1, but DTX
is observed in the corresponding HS-DPCCH ACK/NACK field. The
probability of event *E*~m~ is denoted *P*(*E*~m~).

The requirements and this test apply for Release 10 and later for all
types of UTRA for the FDD UE's supporting optional MIMO-only with
single-stream restriction feature and the optional enhanced performance
requirements type1.

NOTE: This test case can be optionally tested for Rel-9 UE's supporting
optional MIMO-only with single-stream restriction and the optional
enhanced performance requirements type1.

#### 9.4.4A.2 Minimum requirements

For the test parameters specified in Table 9.4.4A.1 with the downlink
physical channel setup in Table E.5.4A, for each value of HS-SCCH-1
*E*~c~/*I*~or~ specified in Table 9.4.4A.2 and Table 9.4.4A.3 the
measured *P*(*E*~m~) shall be less than or equal to the corresponding
specified value of *P*(*E*~m~). The requirements in Table 9.4.4A.2 and
Table 9.4.4A.3 assume STTD is enabled on HS-SCCH and DPCH. The
requirements in Table 9.4.4A.2 and Table 9.4.4A.3 assume HS-SCCH Type 3
coding associated with single stream transmission on HS-DSCH.
Performance requirements specified in Table 9.4.4A.3 are based on
receiver diversity.

#### 9.4.4A.3 Test purpose

To verify that *P*(*E*~m~) does not exceed the limit in Table 9.4.4A.2
and Table 9.4.4A.3 for the single transport block case.

#### 9.4.4A.4 Method of test

##### 9.4.4A.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: normal; see clauses G.2.1 and G.2.2.

Frequencies to be tested: mid range; see clause G.2.4.

1\) Connect SS, multipath fading simulator and an AWGN noise source to
the UE antenna connector as shown in figure A.22 for UEs that support
receive diversity or figure A.12 for UEs that do not support receive
diversity.

2\) Set the test parameters for test 1-2 as specified in table 9.4.4A.5.
Setup fading simulators as fading condition, which are described in
table s D.2.2.1A and D.2.2.1C and clause D.2. The configuration of the
downlink channels is defined in table E.5.4A.

##### 9.4.4A.4.2 Procedure

1\. The UE is switched on.

2\. Set up a HSDPA connection with looping back 12.2kbps RMC according
to the generic HSDPA set-up procedure specified in TS 34.108 \[3\] sub
clause 7.3.6 with the exceptions for information elements listed in
table 9.4.4A.4, with levels according to table E.5.0.

3\. Once the HSDPA connection is setup, change levels according to Table
E.5.4A and start transmitting HSDPA Data.

4\. Count the number of NACK, ACK and statDTX on the UL HS-DPCCH during
the test interval and decide pass or fail according to Annex F.6.1 and
table F.6.1.8. NACK and ACK are counted as a pass and statDTX is counted
as a failure.

then the Test Tolerance applied for this test is non-zero. The Test
Tolerance for this test is defined in clause F.2 and the explanation of
how the Minimum Requirement has been relaxed by the Test Tolerance is
given in clause F.4.

### 9.4.4B HS-SCCH Type 3 Performance for MIMO only with single-stream restriction-STTD disabled-asymmetric CPICHs

#### 9.4.4B.1 Definition and applicability

The detection performance of the HS-SCCH for MIMO only with
single-stream restriction-STTD disabled-asymmetric CPICHs is determined
by the probability of event *E*~m~, which is declared when the UE is
signalled on HS-SCCH-1, but DTX is observed in the corresponding
HS-DPCCH ACK/NACK field. The probability of event *E*~m~ is denoted
*P*(*E*~m~).

The requirements and this test apply for Release 10 and later for all
types of UTRA for the FDD UE that support the optional MIMO only with
single stream restriction.

NOTE: This test case can be optionally executed for Rel-7 and onward
UE's supporting MIMO feature.

#### 9.4.4B.2 Minimum requirements

For the test parameters specified in Table 9.4.4B.1 with the downlink
physical channel setup in Table E.5.4E, for each value of HS-SCCH-1
*E*~c~/*I*~or~ specified in Table 9.4.4B.2 the measured *P*(*E*~m~)
shall be less than or equal to the corresponding specified value of
*P*(*E*~m~). The requirements in Table 9.4.4B.2 assume STTD is disabled
on HS-SCCH and DPCH. The requirements in Table 9.4.4B.2 assume HS-SCCH
Type 3 coding associated with single stream transmission on HS-DSCH.

#### 9.4.4B.3 Test purpose

To verify that *P*(*E*~m~) does not exceed the limit in Table 9.4.4B.2
for the single transport block case.

#### 9.4.4B.4 Method of test

##### 9.4.4B.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: normal; see clauses G.2.1 and G.2.2.

Frequencies to be tested: mid range; see clause G.2.4.

1\) Connect SS, multipath fading simulator and an AWGN noise source to
the UE antenna connector as shown in figure A.22 for UEs that support
receive diversity or figure A.12 for UEs that do not support receive
diversity.

2\) Set the test parameters for test 1-2 as specified in Table 9.4.4B.4.
Setup the fading simulators as fading condition, which are described in
Tables D.2.2.1A and D.2.2.1C and clause D.2. The configuration of the
downlink channels is defined in Table E.5.4E.

##### 9.4.4B.4.2 Procedure

1\. The UE is switched on.

2\. Set up a HSDPA connection with looping back 12.2kbps RMC according
to the generic HSDPA set-up procedure specified in TS 34.108 \[3\] sub
clause 7.3.6 with the exceptions for information elements listed in
Table 9.4.4B.3, with levels according to Table E.5.0.

3\. Once the HSDPA connection is setup, change levels according to Table
E.5.4E and start transmitting HSDPA Data.

4\. Count the number of NACK, ACK and statDTX on the UL HS-DPCCH during
the test interval and decide pass or fail according to Annex F.6.1 and
Table F.6.1.8. NACK and ACK are counted as a pass and statDTX is counted
as a failure.

### 9.4.4C HS-SCCH Type 3 Performance for MIMO only with single-stream restriction-STTD disabled-asymmetric CPICHs- Enhanced Performance Requirements Type 1

#### 9.4.4C.1 Definition and applicability

The detection performance of the HS-SCCH for MIMO only with
single-stream restriction-STTD disabled-asymmetric CPICHs is determined
by the probability of event *E*~m~, which is declared when the UE is
signalled on HS-SCCH-1, but DTX is observed in the corresponding
HS-DPCCH ACK/NACK field. The probability of event *E*~m~ is denoted
*P*(*E*~m~).

The requirements and this test apply for Release 10 and later for all
types of UTRA for the FDD UE's supporting the optional MIMO-only with
single-stream restriction feature and the optional enhanced performance
requirements type1.

NOTE: This test case can be optionally tested for Rel-9 UE's supporting
optional MIMO-only with single-stream restriction feature and the
optional enhanced performance requirements type1.

#### 9.4.4C.2 Minimum requirements

For the test parameters specified in Table 9.4.4C.1 with the downlink
physical channel setup in Table E.5.4E, for each value of HS-SCCH-1
*E*~c~/*I*~or~ specified in Table 9.4.4C.2 the measured *P*(*E*~m~)
shall be less than or equal to the corresponding specified value of
*P*(*E*~m~). The requirements in Table 9.4.4C.2 assume STTD is disabled
on HS-SCCH and DPCH. The requirements in Table 9.4.4C.2 assume HS-SCCH
Type 3 coding associated with single stream transmission on HS-DSCH.

#### 9.4.4C.3 Test purpose

To verify that *P*(*E*~m~) does not exceed the limit in Table 9.4.4C.2
for the single transport block case.

#### 9.4.4C.4 Method of test

##### 9.4.4C.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: normal; see clauses G.2.1 and G.2.2.

Frequencies to be tested: mid range; see clause G.2.4.

1\) Connect SS, multipath fading simulator and an AWGN noise source to
the UE antenna connector as shown in figure A.22 for UEs that support
receive diversity or figure A.12 for UEs that do not support receive
diversity.

2\) Set the test parameters for test 1-2 as specified in table 9.4.4C.4.
Setup fading simulators as fading condition, which are described in
Tables D.2.2.1A and D.2.2.1C and clause D.2. The configuration of the
downlink channels is defined in table E.5.4E.

##### 9.4.4C.4.2 Procedure

1\. The UE is switched on.

2\. Set up a HSDPA connection with looping back 12.2kbps RMC according
to the generic HSDPA set-up procedure specified in TS 34.108 \[3\] sub
clause 7.3.6 with the exceptions for information elements listed in
table 9.4.4C.3, with levels according to table E.5.0.

3\. Once the HSDPA connection is setup, change levels according to Table
E.5.4E and start transmitting HSDPA Data.

4\. Count the number of NACK, ACK and statDTX on the UL HS-DPCCH during
the test interval and decide pass or fail according to Annex F.6.1 and
table F.6.1.8. NACK and ACK are counted as a pass and statDTX is counted
as a failure.

NOTE: If the above Test Requirement differs from the Minimum Requirement
then the Test Tolerance applied for this test is non-zero. The Test
Tolerance for this test is defined in clause F.2 and the explanation of
how the Minimum Requirement has been relaxed by the Test Tolerance is
given in clause F.4.

### 9.4.4D HS-SCCH Type 3 Performance for MIMO only with single-stream restriction-STTD enabled-asymmetric CPICHs

#### 9.4.4D.1 Definition and applicability

The detection performance of the HS-SCCH for MIMO only with
single-stream restriction-STTD enabled-asymmetric CPICHs is determined
by the probability of event *E*~m~, which is declared when the UE is
signalled on HS-SCCH-1, but DTX is observed in the corresponding
HS-DPCCH ACK/NACK field. The probability of event *E*~m~ is denoted
*P*(*E*~m~).

The requirements and this test apply for Release 10 and later for all
types of UTRA for the FDD UE that support the optional TX Diversity on
DL Control Channels and the optional MIMO only with single stream
restriction.

NOTE: This test case can be optionally executed for Rel-7 and onward
UE's supporting MIMO feature.

#### 9.4.4D.2 Minimum requirements

For the test parameters specified in Table 9.4.4D.1 with the downlink
physical channel setup in Table E.5.4E, for each value of HS-SCCH-1
*E*~c~/*I*~or~ specified in Table 9.4.4D.2 the measured *P*(*E*~m~)
shall be less than or equal to the corresponding specified value of
*P*(*E*~m~). The requirements in Table 9.4.4D.2 assume STTD is enabled
on HS-SCCH and DPCH. The requirements in Table 9.4.4D.2 assume HS-SCCH
Type 3 coding associated with single stream transmission on HS-DSCH.

#### 9.4.4D.3 Test purpose

To verify that *P*(*E*~m~) does not exceed the limit in Table 9.4.4D.2
for the single transport block case.

#### 9.4.4D.4 Method of test

##### 9.4.4D.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: normal; see clauses G.2.1 and G.2.2.

Frequencies to be tested: mid range; see clause G.2.4.

1\) Connect SS, multipath fading simulator and an AWGN noise source to
the UE antenna connector as shown in figure A.22 for UEs that support
receive diversity or figure A.12 for UEs that do not support receive
diversity.

2\) Set the test parameters for test 1-2 as specified in Table 9.4.4D.4.
Setup the fading simulators as fading condition, which are described in
Tables D.2.2.1A and D.2.2.1C and clause D.2. The configuration of the
downlink channels is defined in Table E.5.4E.

##### 9.4.4D.4.2 Procedure

1\. The UE is switched on.

2\. Set up a HSDPA connection with looping back 12.2kbps RMC according
to the generic HSDPA set-up procedure specified in TS 34.108 \[3\] sub
clause 7.3.6 with the exceptions for information elements listed in
Table 9.4.4D.3, with levels according to Table E.5.0.

3\. Once the HSDPA connection is setup, change levels according to Table
E.5.4E and start transmitting HSDPA Data.

4\. Count the number of NACK, ACK and statDTX on the UL HS-DPCCH during
the test interval and decide pass or fail according to Annex F.6.1 and
Table F.6.1.8. NACK and ACK are counted as a pass and statDTX is counted
as a failure.

### 9.4.4E HS-SCCH Type 3 Performance for MIMO only with single-stream restriction-STTD enabled-asymmetric CPICHs- Enhanced Performance Requirements Type 1

#### 9.4.4E.1 Definition and applicability

The detection performance of the HS-SCCH for MIMO only with
single-stream restriction-STTD enabled-asymmetric CPICHs is determined
by the probability of event *E*~m~, which is declared when the UE is
signalled on HS-SCCH-1, but DTX is observed in the corresponding
HS-DPCCH ACK/NACK field. The probability of event *E*~m~ is denoted
*P*(*E*~m~).

The requirements and this test apply for Release 10 and later for all
types of UTRA for the FDD UE's supporting optional Tx Diversity on DL
Control channels and the optional MIMO-only with single-stream
restriction feature and the optional enhanced performance requirements
type1.

NOTE: This test case can be optionally tested for Rel-9 UE's supporting
optional Tx diversity on DL Control channels and supporting optional
MIMO-only with single-stream restriction feature and the optional
enhanced performance requirements type1

#### 9.4.4E.2 Minimum requirements

For the test parameters specified in Table 9.4.4E.1 with the downlink
physical channel setup in Table E.5.4E, for each value of HS-SCCH-1
*E*~c~/*I*~or~ specified in Table 9.4.4E.2 the measured *P*(*E*~m~)
shall be less than or equal to the corresponding specified value of
*P*(*E*~m~). The requirements in Table 9.4.4E.2 assume STTD is enabled
on HS-SCCH and DPCH. The requirements in Table 9.4.4E.2 assume HS-SCCH
Type 3 coding associated with single stream transmission on HS-DSCH.

9.5 HS-SCCH-less demodulation of HS-DSCH (Fixed Reference Channel)
------------------------------------------------------------------

During the Fixed Reference Channel tests the behaviour of the Node-B
emulator in response to the ACK/NACK signalling field of the HS-DPCCH is
specified in Table 9.2.4.

Performance requirements in this section assume sufficient power
allocation to HS-SCCH\_1, so that the probability of detection failure,
when the HS-SCCH-1 uses the identity of the UE under test, is very low.

### 9.5.1 Requirement QPSK, Fixed Reference Channel (FRC) H-Set 7

#### 9.5.1.1 Definition and applicability

The receiver performance of the High Speed Physical Downlink Shared
Channel (HS-DSCH) with HS-SCCH-less operation in multi-path fading
environment is determined by the information bit throughput R.

The requirements and this test apply to Release 7 and later releases for
all types of UTRA for the FDD UE that support the optional HS-SCCH-less
HS-DSCH.

#### 9.5.1.2 Minimum requirements

The requirements are specified in terms of a minimum information bit
throughput R for the DL reference channels H-Set 7 specified in Annex
C.8.1.7, with the addition of the parameters in Table 9.5.1.1 and the
downlink physical channel setup according to table E.5.1.

Using this configuration the throughput shall meet or exceed the minimum
requirements specified in table 9.5.1.2.

transmission without the HS-SCCH, and be capable of combining the first
transmission and second transmissions. Corresponding throughput
requirements are specified.

#### 9.5.1.4 Method of test

##### 9.5.1.4.1 Initial conditions {#initial-conditions-10 .H6}

Test environment: normal; see clauses G.2.1 and G.2.2.

Frequencies to be tested: mid range; see clause G.2.4.

1\) Connect the SS (node B emulator) and fader and AWGN noise source to
the UE antenna connector as shown in figure A.21 for UEs that support
receive diversity or figure A.10 for UEs that do not support receive
diversity.

2\) Set up an HSDPA call with looping back 12.2kbps RMC according to TS
34.108 \[3\] clause 7.3.6 with levels according to table E.5.0.

3\) Set the test parameters for test 1 according to tables 9.5.1.3 and
9.5.1.4. The configuration of the downlink channels is defined in table
E.5.1.

4\) The information bit data shall be pseudo random and not repeated
before 10 different information bit payload blocks are processed. (Fixed
reference Channel Definition H-Set 7 (QPSK): The information bit payload
block is 605 bits long. Hence the PRBSequence must be at least 605 \* 10
bits long. ) Use a PRBS from ITU-T O.153 Ref \[27\].

5\) The SS shall not time the transmission freely. It shall time the
transmission strictly according to the reference measurement channel as
specified in Annex C.8.1.7.

6\) Setup the fading simulator with fading conditions as described in
table D.2.2.1.B.

##### 9.5.1.4.2 Procedure {#procedure-10 .H6}

transmission and second transmissions. Corresponding throughput
requirements are specified.

#### 9.5.1A.4 Method of test

##### 9.5.1A.4.1 Initial conditions {#a.4.1-initial-conditions-11 .H6}

Test environment: normal; see clauses G.2.1 and G.2.2.

Frequencies to be tested: mid range; see clause G.2.4.

1\) Connect the SS (node B emulator) and fader and AWGN noise source to
the UE antenna connector as shown in figure A.21 for UEs that support
receive diversity or figure A.10 for UEs that do not support receive
diversity.

2\) Set up an HSDPA call with looping back 12.2kbps RMC according to TS
34.108 \[3\] clause 7.3.6 with levels according to table E.5.0.

3\) Set the test parameters for test 1 according to tables 9.5.1A.3 and
9.5.1A.4. The configuration of the downlink channels is defined in table
E.5.1.

4\) The information bit data shall be pseudo random and not repeated
before 10 different information bit payload blocks are processed. (Fixed
reference Channel Definition H-set 7 (QPSK): The information bit payload
block is 605 bits long. Hence the PRBSequence must be at least 605 \* 10
bits long. ) Use a PRBS from ITU-T O.153 Ref \[27\].

5\) The SS shall not time the transmission freely. It shall time the
transmission strictly according to the reference measurement channel as
specified in Annex C.8.1.7.

6\) Setup the fading simulator with fading conditions as described in
table D.2.2.1.B and for UEs that support receive diversity as also
described in clause D.2.5.

##### 9.5.1A.4.2 Procedure {#a.4.2-procedure-10 .H6}

1\) Once the HSDPA connection is setup, change levels according to
Tables E.5.6 and start transmitting HSDPA Data.

2\) The SS shall count the number of NACK, ACK and statDTX on the UL
HS-DPCCH during the test interval and decide pass or fail according to
Annex F.6.3 tables F.6.3.5.4.8.

##### 9.6.1.4.1 Initial conditions {#initial-conditions-11 .H6}

Test environment: normal; see clauses G.2.1 and G.2.2.

Frequencies to be tested: mid range; see clause G.2.4.

1\) Connect the SS (node B emulator), multipath fading simulator and
AWGN noise source to the UE antenna connector as shown in figure A.21
for UEs that support receive diversity or figure A.10 for UEs that do
not support receive diversity.

2\) Enter the UE into the CELL\_FACH state according to TS 34.108 \[3\]
clause 7.3.12 with levels according to table E.5.0 and enter the UE into
loopback test mode 1 with UL RLC SDU size to 64 bits (see note). See TS
34.108 and TS 34.109 for details regarding loopback test mode 1.

3\) The information bit data, sent on HS-DSCH, shall be pseudo random
and not repeated before 10 different information bit payload blocks are
processed. (e.g. Fixed reference Channel Definition H-set 3 (QPSK): The
information bit payload block is 3202 bits long. Hence the PRBSequence
must be at least 3202 \* 10 bits long. ) Use a PRBS from ITU-T O.153 Ref
\[27\]

4\) Once the HSDPA connection is setup, change levels according to Table
E.5.4C and start transmitting HSDPA Data.

NOTE 2: The radio bearer configuration used by TS 34.108 clause 7.3.12

SS will transmit a transport block every 2 ms (H-set 3 (QPSK) with
Inter-.TTI=1), bit only one new block per HARQ process in 4
transmissions. To be able to loop back all the DL SDUs in the UL, 4 UL
RLC SDUs per uplink TTI (4\*(UL RLC SDU size + Length Indicator (7 bits)
+ E-bit (1 bit) ) + AMD SDU fixed size (16 bits) \< 320 bits) is
required assuming a preamble message can be sent every 3^rd^ frame.

##### 9.6.1.4.2 Procedure {#procedure-11 .H6}

1\. The SS sends \[100\] consecutive valid MAC headers and SDUs to the
UE. The no of bits in 1 RLC SDU (2963 bits) shall fit into 1 transport
block (3202 bits)

2\. The SS counts the received RLC SDUs in uplink.

3\. The SS accumulates the No of SDUs, sent in step 1 and the No of
received SDUs in step 2 after each iteration and calculates the
preliminary SDU ER

4\. Repeat step 1 to 3, until statistical significance according to
Annex F.6.3 achieved.

not support receive diversity.

2\) Enter the UE into the CELL\_FACH state according to TS 34.108 \[3\]
clause 7.3.12 with levels according to table E.5.0 and enter the UE into
loopback test mode 1 with UL RLC SDU size to 64 bits (see note). See TS
34.108 and TS 34.109 for details regarding loopback test mode 1.

3\) The SS shall transmit the TF according to the CQI1 value defined in
TS 25.214. HS-PDSCH is transmitted without HARQ transmissions.

4\) Once the HSDPA connection is setup, change levels according to Table
E.5.4C and start transmitting HSDPA Data. The HS-PDSCH\_Ec/Ior shall be
set to -2.9 dB to guarantee zero BLER on the HS-PDSCH.

NOTE: The radio bearer configuration used by TS 34.108 clause 7.3.12 for
