Foreword

This Technical Specification has been produced by the 3rd Generation
Partnership Project (3GPP).

The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work
within the TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the
TSG modify the contents of the present document, it will be re-released
by the TSG with an identifying change of release date and an increase in
version number as follows:

Version x.y.z

where:

x the first digit:

1 presented to TSG for information;

2 presented to TSG for approval;

3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.

y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e.
technical enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.

z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been
incorporated in the document.

The present document is one part of a multi-part Technical Specification
(TS) covering the New Radio (NR) User Equipment (UE) conformance
specification, which is divided in the following parts:

3GPP TS 38.521-1 \[1\]: NR; User Equipment (UE) conformance
specification; Radio transmission and reception; Part 1: Range 1
Standalone;

**3GPP TS 38.521-2 \[2\]: NR; User Equipment (UE) conformance
specification; Radio transmission and reception; Part 2: Range 2
Standalone;**

3GPP TS 38.521-3 \[3\]: NR; User Equipment (UE) conformance
specification; Radio transmission and reception; Part 3: Range 1 and
Range 2 Interworking operation with other radios;

3GPP TS 38.521-4 \[4\]: NR; User Equipment conformance specification;
Radio transmission and reception; Part 4: Performance;

**3GPP TS 38.522: NR; User Equipment (UE) conformance specification;
Applicability of RF and RRM test cases;**

3GPP TS 38.533 \[5\]: NR; User Equipment (UE) conformance specification;
Radio resource management;

 1 Scope
=======

The present document specifies the recommended applicability statement
and completion status for the test cases included in 3GPP TS 38.521-1
\[1\], TS 38.521-2 \[2\], TS 38.521-3 \[3\], TS 38.521-4 \[4\] and TS
38.533 \[5\]. These applicability statements are based on the features
implemented in the UE.

Special conformance testing functions can be found in 3GPP TS 38.509
\[6\] and the common test environments are included in 3GPP TS 38.508-1
\[7\]. Common implementation conformance statement (ICS) proforma can be
found in 3GPP TS 38.508-2 \[8\].

The present document is valid for UE implemented according to 3GPP
releases starting from Release 15 up to the Release indicated on the
cover page of the present document.

2 References
============

The following documents contain provisions which, through reference in
this text, constitute provisions of the present document.

\- References are either specific (identified by date of publication,
edition number, version number, etc.) or non‑specific.

\- For a specific reference, subsequent revisions do not apply.

\- For a non-specific reference, the latest version applies. In the case
of a reference to a 3GPP document (including a GSM document), a
non-specific reference implicitly refers to the latest version of that
document in the same Release as the present document unless the context
in which the reference is made suggests a different Release is relevant
(information on the applicable release in a particular context can be
found in e.g. test case title, description or applicability, message
description or content).
