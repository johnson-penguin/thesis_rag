Foreword
========

This Technical Specification has been produced by the 3^rd^ Generation
Partnership Project (3GPP).

The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work
within the TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the
TSG modify the contents of the present document, it will be re-released
by the TSG with an identifying change of release date and an increase in
version number as follows:

Version x.y.z

where:

x the first digit:

1 presented to TSG for information;

2 presented to TSG for approval;

3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.

Y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e.
technical enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.

z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been
incorporated in the document.

1 Scope
=======

The present document specifies the standards for user data transport
protocols and related signalling protocols to establish user plane
transport bearers over the Xn interface.

3 Definitions and abbreviations
===============================

3.1 Definitions
---------------

For the purposes of the present document, the following terms and
definitions below apply. Terms and definitions not defined below can be
found in TR 21.905 \[1\].

**NG-RAN node:** as defined in TS 38.300 \[7\].

3.2 Abbreviations
-----------------

For the purposes of the present document, the abbreviations given in
3GPP TR 21.905 \[1\] and the following apply. An abbreviation defined in
the present document takes precedence over the definition of the same
abbreviation, if any, in 3GPP TR 21.905 \[1\].

GTP GPRS Tunnelling Protocol

IP Internet Protocol

TEID Tunnel Endpoint Identifier

UDP User Datagram Protocol

4 Data link layer
=================

Any data link protocol that fulfils the requirements toward the upper
layer may be used.

5 Xn interface user plane protocol
==================================

5.1 General
-----------

The transport layer for data streams over Xn is an IP based Transport.
The following figure shows the transport protocol stacks over Xn.

Figure 5.1: Transport network layer for data streams over Xn

The GTP-U (TS 29.281 \[2\]) protocol over UDP over IP shall be supported
as the transport for data streams on the Xn interface. The data link
layer is as specified in clause 4.

The transport bearer is identified by the GTP-U TEID (TS 29.281 \[3\])
and the IP address (source TEID, destination TEID, source IP address,
destination IP address).

5.2 GTP-U
---------

The GTP-U (TS 29.281 \[2\]) protocol shall be used over the Xn interface
between two NG-RAN nodes.

5.3 UDP/IP
----------

The path protocol used shall be UDP (IETF RFC 768 \[3\]).

The UDP port number for GTP-U shall be as defined in TS 29.281 \[2\].

The NG-RAN nodes over the Xn interface shall support fragmentation and
assembly of GTP packets at the IP layer.

The NG-RAN nodes shall support IPv6 (IETF RFC 8200 \[5\]) and/or IPv4
(IETF RFC 791 \[6\]).

There may be one or several IP addresses in both NG-RAN nodes. The
packet processing function in the source NG-RAN node shall send
downstream packets of a given flow to the target NG-RAN node IP address
(received in XnAP) associated to the DL transport bearer of that
particular flow. The packet processing function in the source NG-RAN
node shall send upstream packets of a given flow to the target NG-RAN
node IP address (received in XnAP) associated to the UL transport bearer
of that particular flow.

The Transport Layer Address signalled in XnAP messages is a bit string
of:

a\) 32 bits in case of IPv4 address according to IETF RFC 791 \[6\]; or

b\) 128 bits in case of IPv6 address according to IETF RFC 8200 \[5\];
or

c\) 160 bits if both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses are signalled, in which
case the IPv4 address is contained in the first 32 bits.

5.4 DiffServ code point marking
-------------------------------

IP Differentiated Services code point marking (IETF RFC 2474 \[4\])
shall be supported. The mapping between traffic categories and DiffServ
code points shall be configurable by O&M based on 5G QoS Class
Identifier (5QI) , the Priority Level (if explicitly signalled), and
other NG-RAN traffic parameters (e.g. ARP). Traffic categories are
implementation-specific and may be determined from the application
parameters.
