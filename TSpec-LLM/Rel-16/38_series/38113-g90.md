 Foreword
========

This Technical Specification has been produced by the 3rd Generation
Partnership Project (3GPP).

The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work
within the TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the
TSG modify the contents of the present document, it will be re-released
by the TSG with an identifying change of release date and an increase in
version number as follows:

Version x.y.z

where:

x the first digit:

1 presented to TSG for information;

2 presented to TSG for approval;

3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.

y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e.
technical enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.

z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been
incorporated in the document.

In the present document, modal verbs have the following meanings:

**shall** indicates a mandatory requirement to do something

**shall not** indicates an interdiction (prohibition) to do something

The constructions \"shall\" and \"shall not\" are confined to the
context of normative provisions, and do not appear in Technical Reports.

The constructions \"must\" and \"must not\" are not used as substitutes
for \"shall\" and \"shall not\". Their use is avoided insofar as
possible, and they are not used in a normative context except in a
direct citation from an external, referenced, non-3GPP document, or so
as to maintain continuity of style when extending or modifying the
provisions of such a referenced document.

**should** indicates a recommendation to do something

**should not** indicates a recommendation not to do something

**may** indicates permission to do something

**need not** indicates permission not to do something

The construction \"may not\" is ambiguous and is not used in normative
elements. The unambiguous constructions \"might not\" or \"shall not\"
are used instead, depending upon the meaning intended.

**can** indicates that something is possible

**cannot** indicates that something is impossible

The constructions \"can\" and \"cannot\" are not substitutes for \"may\"
and \"need not\".

**will** indicates that something is certain or expected to happen as a
result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside
the scope of the present document

**will not** indicates that something is certain or expected not to
happen as a result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which
is outside the scope of the present document

**might** indicates a likelihood that something will happen as a result
of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document

**might not** indicates a likelihood that something will not happen as a
result of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside
the scope of the present document

In addition:

**is** (or any other verb in the indicative mood) indicates a statement
of fact

**is not** (or any other negative verb in the indicative mood) indicates
a statement of fact

The constructions \"is\" and \"is not\" do not indicate requirements.

 1 Scope
=======

The present document covers the assessment of NR Base Station (BS) and
ancillary equipment in respect of Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC).

The present document specifies the applicable requirements, procedures,
test conditions, performance assessment and performance criteria for NR
base stations and associated ancillary equipment in the following
categories:

\- BS equipped with antenna connectors or *TAB connectors* which are
possible to be terminated during EMC testing, meeting the *BS type 1-C*
and *BS type* *1-H* RF requirements of TS 38.104 \[2\], with conformance
demonstrated by compliance to TS 38.141-1 \[3\].

\- BS not equipped with antenna connectors nor *TAB connectors*, i.e.
with antenna elements radiating during the EMC testing, meeting the *BS
type 1-O* and *BS type* *2-O* RF requirements of TS 38.104 \[2\], with
conformance demonstrated by compliance to TS 38.141-2 \[4\].

Technical requirements related to the antenna and TAB connectors are not
included in the present document. These are found in the relevant
product standards \[2-4\].

The environment classification used in the present document refers to
the residential, commercial and light industrial environment
classification used in IEC 61000‑6-1 \[7\], IEC 61000-6-3 \[8\] and IEC
61000-6-8 \[33\].

The EMC requirements have been selected to ensure an adequate level of
compatibility for apparatus at residential, commercial and light
industrial environments. The levels, however, do not cover extreme cases
which may occur in any location but with low probability of occurrence.

3.1 Definitions
---------------

For the purposes of the present document, the terms and definitions
given in TR 21.905 \[1\] and the following apply. A term defined in the
present document takes precedence over the definition of the same term,
if any, in TR 21.905 \[1\].

intended to be used with a receiver or transmitter**

NOTE: It is considered as an ancillary equipment if:

the equipment is intended for use with a receiver or transmitter to
provide additional operational and/or control features to the radio
equipment, (e.g. to extend control to another position or location); and

the equipment cannot be used on a stand alone basis to provide user
functions independently of a receiver or transmitter; and

the receiver or transmitter, to which it is connected, is capable of
providing some intended operation such as transmitting and/or receiving
without the ancillary equipment (i.e. it is not a sub-unit of the main
equipment essential to the main equipment basic functions).

**antenna port: for EMC purposes,** *port* for connection of an antenna
used for intentional transmission and/or reception of radiated RF
energy, equivalent to an RF antenna connector/*TAB connector* in
TS 37.105 \[25\].

test site. A practical approximation is a Fully-Anechoic Room (FAR).

**fully-anechoic room:** shielded enclosure, the internal surfaces of
which are lined with radio-frequency-energy absorbing material (i.e. RF
absorber) that absorbs electromagnetic energy in the frequency range of
interest.

to telecommunication networks (e.g. public switched telecommunication
networks, integrated services digital networks), local area networks
(e.g. Ethernet, Token Ring) and similar networks.

NOTE: *Telecommunication port* is called \"wired network port\" in CISPR
32 \[11\] and ETSI EN 301 489-1 \[23\].

=================

4.1 General
-----------

Requirements throughout the EMC specifications are in some cases defined
separately for different frequency ranges (FR). The frequency ranges FR1
and FR2 are defined in subclause 5.1 of TS 38.104 \[2\].

The equipment shall be tested in normal test environment defined in the
corresponding BS conformance testing specification TS 38.141-1 \[3\] for
*BS type 1-C* and *BS type 1-H*, or TS 38.141-2 \[4\] for *BS type 1-O*
and *BS type 2-O*. The test conditions shall be recorded in the test
report.

For BS capable of multi-band operation, the requirements in the present
document apply for each supported *operating band* unless otherwise
stated. *Operating bands* shall be activated according to the test
configuration in subclause 4.5. Tests shall be performed relating to
each type of *port* and all *operating bands* shall be assessed during
the tests.

The manufacturer shall declare the supported *operating band(s)*
according to the list of NR *operating bands* defined in TS 38.104
\[2\].

NOTE 1: NR *operating bands* for *BS type 1-C* and *BS type 1-H*, are
declared by the manufacturer according to the declaration D.3 specified
in TS 38.141-1 \[3\], table 4.6-1.

NOTE 2: NR *operating bands* for *BS type 1-O* and *BS type 2-O,* are
declared by the manufacturer according to the declaration D.4 specified
in TS 38.141-2 \[4\], table 4.6-1.

4.2 Arrangements for establishing a communication link
------------------------------------------------------

The wanted RF input signal nominal frequency shall be selected by
setting the NR Absolute Radio Frequency Channel Number (NR-ARFCN) to an
appropriate number, as defined in TS 38.104 \[2\], clause 5.4.2.3.

A communication link shall be set up with a suitable test system capable
of evaluating the required performance criteria (hereafter called \"the
test system\") at the radio interface and *telecommunication port(s)*
(the NG interface). The test system shall be located outside of the test
environment.

When the EUT is required to be in the transmit/receive mode, the
following conditions shall be met:

\- For the *BS type 1-C* and *BS type 1-H* testing, the EUT shall be
commanded to operate at rated transmit power;

\- For the *BS type 1-O* and *BS type 2-O* testing, the EUT transmit
power shall be configured as stated in subclause 8.1 for emission test
and subclause 9.1 for immunity test accordingly;

\- Adequate measures shall be taken to avoid the effect of the unwanted
signal on the measuring equipment;

\- The wanted input signal level shall be set to a level where the
performance is not limited by the receiver noise floor or strong signal
effects.

NOTE: 15 dB above the conducted reference sensitivity level has been
used as an example of wanted input signal level in legacy 3GPP EMC
specifications for establishing a communication link.

For immunity tests clause 4.3 shall apply and the conditions shall be as
follows.

4.3 Narrow band responses on receivers
--------------------------------------

Responses on receivers or duplex transceivers occurring during the
immunity test at discrete frequencies which are narrow band responses
(spurious responses), are identified by the following method:

\- if during an immunity test the quantity being monitored goes outside
the specified tolerances (clause 6), it is necessary to establish
whether the deviation is due to a narrow band response or to a wide band
(EMC) phenomenon. Therefore, the test shall be repeated with the
unwanted signal frequency increased, and then decreased by 2 x
BW~Channel~ MHz, where BW~Channel~ is the channel bandwidth as defined
in TS 38.104 \[2\], clause 5.3;

\- if the deviation disappears in either one or both of the above MHz
offset cases, then the response is considered as a narrow band response;

\- if the deviation does not disappear, this may be due to the fact that
the offset has made the frequency of the unwanted signal correspond to
the frequency of another narrow band response. Under these circumstances
the procedure is repeated with the increase and decrease of the
frequency of the unwanted signal set to 2.5 x BW~Channel~ MHz;

\- if the deviation does not disappear with the increased and/or
decreased frequency, the phenomenon is considered wide band and
therefore an EMC problem and the equipment fails the test.

For immunity test narrow band responses are disregarded.

For BS capable of multi-band operation, all supported *operating bands*
shall be considered for narrowband responses.

4.4 Exclusion bands
-------------------

### 4.4.1 Transmitter exclusion band

The *transmitter exclusion band* for BS is the frequency range over
which no tests of radiated immunity of a transmitter are made. The
*transmitter exclusion band only applies to BS type 1-O.*

The *transmitter exclusion band* is defined as:

F~DL,low~ -- Δf~OBUE~\<f \< F~DL,high~ + Δf~OBUE~

Where:

Values of F~DL,low~ and F~DL,high~ are defined for each *operating band*
in TS 38.104 \[2\], clause 5.2.

The value of Δf~OBUE~ is derived considering the width of the *operating
band*, and is defined in TS 38.104 \[2\], clause 6.6.2.

For BS capable of multi-band operation, the total *transmitter exclusion
band* is a combination of the *exclusion bands* for each *operating
band* supported by BS.

NOTE 1: The *transmitter exclusion bands* do not apply for SUL bands.

NOTE 2: As the radiated immunity testing is defined in the frequency
range 80 MHz to 6 GHz, there is no *transmitter exclusion band* defined
for *BS type 2-O*.

### 4.4.2 Receiver exclusion band

The *receiver exclusion band* for BS is the frequency range over which
no tests of radiated immunity of a receiver are made.

The *receiver exclusion band* is defined as:

F~UL,low~ -- Δf~OOB~\<f \< F~UL,high~ + Δf~OOB~

Where:

Values of F~UL,low~ and F~UL,high~ are defined for each *operating band*
in TS 38.104 \[2\], clause 5.2.

The value of Δf~OOB~ is derived considering the width of the *operating
band*, and is defined in TS 38.104 \[2\], clause 7.4.2.2.

In case the *spatial exclusion zone* (as depicted in figure 9.2.2-1) is
not used during the EMC RI testing, the receiver exclusion band for *BS
type 1-O* is defined as:

F~UL,low~ -- Δf~RIexclusion~ \< f \< F~UL,high~ + Δf~RIexclusion~

Where the values of Δf~RIexclusion~ are defined in table 4.4.2-1.

Table 4.4.2-1: Maximum Δf~RIexclusion~ offset outside the uplink
operating band

  ------------------------------------ -----------------------
  *Operating band* characteristics     Δf~RIexclusion~ (MHz)
  100 MHz ≥ F~UL,high~ -- F~UL,low~    60
  100 MHz \< F~UL,high~ -- F~UL,low~   200
  ------------------------------------ -----------------------

For BS capable of multi-band operation, the total *receiver exclusion
band* is a combination of the *exclusion bands* for each *operating
band* supported by BS.

NOTE 1: The *receiver exclusion bands* do not apply for SDL bands.

NOTE 2: As the radiated immunity testing is defined in the frequency
range 80 MHz to 6 GHz, there is no *receiver exclusion band* defined for
*BS type 2-O*.

4.5 BS test configurations
--------------------------

The present clause defines the BS test configurations that shall be used
for demonstrating conformance. A single NR carrier shall be used for
testing of single-carrier capable BS.

Single carrier configuration (SC) tests shall be performed using signal
with narrowest supported *BS channel bandwidth* with the smallest
supported subcarrier spacing declared per *operating band in TS 38.141-1
\[3\] clause 4.6, and TS 38.141-2 \[4\] clause 4.6.*

For other NR base stations, the test configurations in table 4.5-1 and
table 4.5-2 shall be used. The NR test configurations (NRTCx) are
defined in TS 38.141-1 \[3\], clause 4.7 for *BS type 1-C* and *BS type
1-H* and in TS 38.141-2 \[4\], clause 4.8 for *BS type 1-O* and *BS type
2-O*.

5 Performance assessment
========================

5.1 General
-----------

The following information shall be recorded in or annexed to the test
report:

\- the primary functions of the radio equipment to be tested during and
after the EMC testing;

\- the intended functions of the radio equipment which shall be in
accordance with the documentation accompanying the equipment;

\- the method to be used to verify that a communications link is
established and maintained;

\- the user-control functions and stored data that are required for
normal operation and the method to be used to assess whether these have
been lost after EMC stress;

\- the *ancillary equipment* to be combined with the radio equipment for
testing (where applicable);

\- the information about *ancillary equipment* intended to be used with
the radio equipment;

\- information about the common and/or band-specific active RF
components and other hardware blocks for a communication link in BS
capable of multi-band operation;

\- an exhaustive list of *ports* (and *RIBs*), classified as either
power or signal/control. Power *ports* shall further be classified as AC
or DC power.

Performance assessment of a BS with multiple enclosures may be done
separately for the BS part with the Radio digital unit and the Radio
unit respectively, according to the manufacturer\'s choice.

A communication link used by more than one *operating band*, shall be
assessed on all *operating band*s. Communication link(s) and/or radio
performance parameters for the *operating band*s can during the test be
assessed simultaneously or separately for each band, depending on the
test environment capability.

5.2 Assessment of throughput in Downlink
----------------------------------------

A communication link shall be established between the transmitter (via
*port* for the *BS type 1-C* and *BS type 1-H*, or via RIB for the *BS
type 1-O* and *BS type 2-O*) and the test equipment. Test equipment
shall meet the requirements for the throughput assessment defined in TS
38.101-4 \[27\] for the bearer used in the immunity tests. The level of
the signal supplied to the equipment should be within the range for
which the assessment of throughput is not impaired. Power control shall
be OFF during the immunity testing.

5.3 Assessment of throughput in Uplink
--------------------------------------

The value of the throughput at the output of the receiver shall be
monitored at NG interface by using suitable test equipment.

5.4 Ancillary equipment
-----------------------

At the manufacturer\'s discretion the test may be performed on the
*ancillary equipment* separately or on a representative configuration of
the combination of radio and *ancillary equipment*. In each case EUT is
tested against all applicable immunity and emission clauses of the
present document and in each case, compliance enables the *ancillary
equipment* to be used with different radio equipment.

6 Performance criteria
======================

6.1 Performance criteria for continuous phenomena for BS
--------------------------------------------------------

The test should, where possible, be performed using a bearer with the
characteristics of data rate and throughput defined in table 6.1-1 and
table 6.1-2. If the test is not performed using one of these bearers
(for example, of none of them are supported by the BS), the
characteristics of the bearer used shall be recorded in the test report.

The throughput in table 6.1-1 and table 6.1-2 is stated relative to the
maximum throughput of the FRC.

The BS uplink and downlink paths shall each meet the performance
criteria defined in table 6.1-1 and table 6.1-2 during the test. If the
uplink and downlink paths are evaluated as a one loop then the criteria
is two times the throughput reduction shown in table 6.1-1 and table
6.1-2 (i.e. throughput \> 90 % instead of throughput \> 95 %). After
each test case BS shall operate as intended with no loss of user control
function, stored data and the communication link shall be maintained.

6.2 Performance criteria for transient phenomena for BS
-------------------------------------------------------

At the conclusion of the total test (comprising the series of individual
exposures to transient phenomena) the EUT shall operate as intended with
no user noticeable loss of control functions or stored data. At the
conclusion of each exposure the EUT shall operate with no user
noticeable loss of the communication link. The channel bandwidth,
sub-carrier spacing and bearer information data rate should be chosen
based on manufacturers declaration and defined according to table 6.1-1
and table 6.1-2.

Table 6.2-1: Void

Table 6.2-2: Void

6.3 Performance criteria for continuous phenomena for Ancillary equipment
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

The apparatus shall continue to operate as intended during and after the
test. No degradation of performance or loss of function is allowed below
the performance level specified by the manufacturer, when the apparatus
is used as intended. The performance level may be replaced by a
permissible performance loss. If the minimum performance level or the
permissible performance loss is not specified by the manufacturer,
either of these may be derived from the product description and
documentation and what the user may reasonably expect from the apparatus
if used as intended.

6.4 Performance criteria for transient phenomena for Ancillary equipment
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The apparatus shall continue to operate as intended after the test. No
degradation of performance or loss of function is allowed below the
performance level specified by the manufacturer, when the apparatus is
used as intended. The performance level may be replaced by a permissible
performance loss. During the test, degradation of performance is however
allowed. If the minimum performance level or the permissible performance
loss is not specified by the manufacturer, either of these may be
derived from the product description and documentation and what the user
may reasonably expect from the apparatus if used as intended.

 8 Emission
==========

8.1 Test configurations
-----------------------

This clause defines the configurations for emission tests as follows:

\- The equipment shall be tested under normal test conditions as
specified in the functional standards;

\- The test configuration shall be as close to normal intended use as
possible;

\- If the equipment is part of a system, or can be connected to
ancillary equipment, then it shall be acceptable to test the equipment
while connected to the minimum configuration of *ancillary equipment*
necessary to exercise the *port*s;

\- If the equipment has a large number of *port*s, then a sufficient
number shall be selected to simulate actual operation conditions and to
ensure that all the different types of termination are tested;

\- The test conditions, test configuration and mode of operation shall
be recorded in the test report;

\- *Port*s which in normal operation are connected shall be connected to
an *ancillary equipment* or to a representative piece of cable correctly
terminated to simulate the input/output characteristics of the
*ancillary equipment*; in case of *BS type 1-H*, *antenna port*s shall
be correctly terminated;

\- For *BS type 1-O* and *BS type 2-O* without *antenna ports* but
intentionally radiating through the *antenna array*, the equipment shall
be placed in a test setup suitable for the radiated power;

\- *Port*s which are not connected to cables during normal operation,
e.g. service connectors, programming connectors, temporary connectors
etc. shall not be connected to any cables for the purpose of EMC
testing. Where cables have to be connected to these *port*s, or
interconnecting cables have to be extended in length in order to
exercise the EUT, precautions shall be taken to ensure that the
evaluation of the EUT is not affected by the addition or extension of
these cables;

\- The test arrangements for transmitter and receiver clauses of the
transceiver are described separately for the sake of clarity. However,
where possible the test of the transmitter clause and receiver clause of
the EUT may be carried out simultaneously to reduce test time.

8.2 Radiated emission
---------------------

### 8.2.1 Radiated emission, BS

This test is applicable to *BS type 1-C* and *BS type 1-H*. This test
shall be performed on a representative configuration of BS.

For *BS type 1-O* and *BS type 2-O*, the radiated emission is covered by
radiated spurious emission requirement in TS 38.104 \[2\], conforming to
the test requirement in TS 38.141-2 \[4\].

#### 8.2.1.1 Definition

This test assesses the ability of BS to limit unwanted emission from the
*enclosure port*.

#### 8.2.1.2 Test method

a\) A test site fulfilling the requirements of ITU-R SM.329 \[24\] shall
be used. The BS shall be placed on a non-conducting support and shall be
operated from a power source via a RF filter to avoid radiation from the
power leads. One of the following two alternative measurement methods
shall be used:

1\) Field strength method measurement

The test method shall be in accordance with CISPR 32 \[11\]. The field
strength measurements shall be performed on a test site that is
validated according to the methods and requirements of CISPR 16-1-4
\[30\].

Unless otherwise stated, measurements are conducted at 3 m or 10 m on an
open area test site (OATS) or semi anechoic chamber (SAC) for
frequencies up to 1 GHz, or at 3 m on a free space open area test site
(FSOATS) or fully-anechoic room (FAR) for frequencies above 1 GHz.
Unless otherwise stated, all measurements are done with RMS detector and
with the -3 dB bandwidth of the measuring filter equal to the reference
bandwidth in table 8.2.1.3-1.

NOTE 1: Test site validation methods for radiated emissions tests are
defined in CISPR 16-1-4 \[30\], clause 6 and 7. Examples of test site
validation methods are listed below:

\- 30 - 1000 MHz frequency range: Normalized Site Attenuation (NSA),
Reference Site Method (RSM).

\- 1 - 18 GHz frequency range: S~VSWR~ standard test procedure, S~VSWR~
reciprocal test procedure.

2\) Substitution method measurement (also called a substitution method)

Mean power of any spurious components shall be detected by the test
antenna and measuring receiver (e.g. a spectrum analyser). At each
frequency at which a component is detected, the BS shall be rotated and
the height of the test antenna adjusted to obtain maximum response, and
the effective radiated power (e.r.p.) of that component determined by a
substitution measurement. The measurement shall be repeated with the
test antenna in the orthogonal polarization plane. Unless otherwise
stated, all measurements are done as mean power (RMS).

NOTE 2: Effective radiated power (e.r.p.) refers to the radiation of a
half wave tuned dipole instead of an isotropic antenna. There is a
constant difference of 2.15 dB between e.i.r.p. and e.r.p, as defined in
ITU-R SM.329 annex 1 \[24\].

e.r.p. (dBm) = EIRP (dBm) − 2.15

b\) The BS shall transmit with maximum power declared by the
manufacturer with all transmitters active. Set the base station to
transmit a signal as stated in clause 4.5.

c\) The received power shall be measured over the frequency range from
30 MHz to F~DL,low~ - Δf~OBUE~ and from F~DL,high~ + Δf~OBUE~ up to
12750 MHz. For some *operating bands*, the upper limit is higher than
12.75 GHz in order to comply with the 5^th^ harmonic limit of the
downlink *operating band*, as specified in ITU-R SM.329 \[24\].The video
bandwidth shall be approximately three times the resolution bandwidth.
If this video bandwidth is not available on the measuring receiver, it
shall be the maximum available and at least 1 MHz. Unless otherwise
stated, all measurements are done as mean power (RMS).

#### 8.2.1.3 Limits

The frequency boundary and reference bandwidths for the detailed
transitions of the limits between the requirements for out of band
emissions and spurious emissions are based on ITU-R Recommendations
SM.329 \[24\] and SM.1539 \[26\].

The *BS type 1-C* and *BS type 1-H* shall meet the limits below:

#### 8.2.1.4 Interpretation of the measurement results

The interpretation of the results recorded in a test report for the
radiated emission measurements described in the present document shall
be as follows:

\- the measured value related to the corresponding limit will be used to
decide whether an equipment meets the requirements of the present
document;

\- the value of the measurement uncertainty for the measurement of each
parameter shall be included in the test report;

\- the recorded value of the measurement uncertainty shall be, for each
measurement, equal to or lower than the figures in table 8.2.1-4-1 for
BS.

Table 8.2.1.4-1 specifies the maximum measurement uncertainty of the
test system. The test system shall enable the equipment under test to be
measured with an uncertainty not exceeding the specified values. All
tolerances and uncertainties are absolute values, and are valid for a
confidence level of 95 %, unless otherwise stated.

A confidence level of 95 % is the measurement uncertainty tolerance
interval for a specific measurement that contains 95% of the performance
of a population of test equipment.

NOTE: If the Test System for a test is known to have a measurement
uncertainty greater than that specified in table 8.2.1.4-1, this
equipment can still be used, provided that an adjustment is made

Any additional uncertainty in the Test System over and above that
specified in table 8.2.1.4-1 is used to tighten the test requirements,
i.e. making the test harder to pass.

This procedure will ensure that a test system not compliant with table

-----------------------

This clause defines the configurations for immunity tests as follows:

\- the equipment shall be tested under normal test conditions as
specified in the functional standards;

\- during the test, the RF output power may be reduced to a power level
sufficient for establishing and maintaining the required communication
link;

\- the test configuration shall be as close to normal intended use as
possible;

\- if the equipment is part of a system, or can be connected to
*ancillary equipment*, then it shall be acceptable to test the equipment
while connected to the minimum configuration of *ancillary equipment*
necessary to exercise the *port*s;

\- if the equipment has a large number of *port*s, then a sufficient
number shall be selected to simulate actual operation conditions and to
ensure that all the different types of termination are tested;

\- the test conditions, test configuration and mode of operation shall
be recorded in the test report;

\- *port*s which in normal operation are connected shall be connected to
an *ancillary equipment* or to a representative piece of cable correctly
terminated to simulate the input/output characteristics of the
*ancillary equipment*. In case of *BS type 1-C and BS type 1-H*,
*antenna ports* shall be correctly terminated;

\- *port*s which are not connected to cables during normal operation,
e.g. service connectors, programming connectors, temporary connectors
etc. shall not be connected to any cables for the purpose of EMC
testing. Where cables have to be connected to these *port*s, or
interconnecting cables have to be extended in length in order to
exercise the EUT, precautions shall be taken to ensure that the
evaluation of the EUT is not affected by the addition or extension of
these cables;

\- immunity tests on the entire NR BS shall be performed by establishing
communication links at the radio interface (e.g. with the mobile
simulator) and the NG interface (e.g. with an NGC simulator) and
evaluating the throughput (see figures 9.1-1 and 9.1-2);

\- immunity tests shall be performed on both the uplink and downlink
paths. The tests shall also include both the radio interface and the NG
interface. Throughput evaluation may be carried out at either interface,
where appropriate, and the measurements for the uplink and downlink
paths may be carried out as a single path looped at either the radio
interface or NG interface. In case of looping is used care have to be
taken that the throughput information doesn\'t change due to looping;

\- for NR BS capable of multi-band operation, communication links shall
be established in such a way that all *operating band*(s) are activated
during the test according to the applicable test configurations in
clause 4.5. Performance assessment may be done separately for each
*operating band*.
