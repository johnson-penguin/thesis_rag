========================================

3.1 Definitions
---------------

For the purposes of the present document, the terms and definitions
given in 3GPP TR 21.905 \[1\] and the following apply. A term defined in
the present document takes precedence over the definition of the same
term, if any, in 3GPP TR 21.905 \[1\].

**Carrier: modulated waveform conveying the E-UTRA or UTRA physical
channels**

**Channel bandwidth:** RF bandwidth supporting a single E-UTRA RF
carrier with the transmission bandwidth configured in the uplink or
downlink of a cell.

**Channel edge:** lowest or highest frequency of the NR carrier,
separated by the *BS channel bandwidth*.

**Contiguous spectrum:** spectrum consisting of a contiguous block of
spectrum with no *sub-block gap*(s).

**Inter-band gap**: The frequency gap between two supported consecutive
operating bands.

**operating band:** frequency range in which NR operates (paired or
unpaired), that is defined with a specific set of technical requirements

3.2 Symbols
-----------

For the purposes of the present document, the following symbols apply:

∆f Separation between the channel edge frequency and the nominal -3dB
point of the measuring filter closest to the carrier frequency

∆f~max~ The largest value of ∆f used for defining the requirement

F~C~ *RF reference frequency* on the channel raster

f\_offset Separation between the channel edge frequency and the centre
of the measuring filter

f\_offset~max~ The maximum value of f\_offset used for defining the
requirement

4 Background
============

NR band n65 is a LTE re-farming band from LTE Band 65. During NR Rel-15,
many LTE re-farming bands were included into NR specifications as a part
of the NR standardization work, without any band specific TR\'s. From
Rel-16 onwards, a band specific WI is needed to add LTE re-farming band
into NR specifications.

As the band n65 is very similar to LTE B65, with small UE aspect
differences, the list of issues is pretty limited.

5 Frequency band arrangements
=============================

5.1 Adjacent 3GPP bands
-----------------------

The 3GPP bands nearby to band n65, when addressing co-existence aspects
are bands 1 and 34 as shown in figure 5.1. Band 1 is for both Region 1
and 3, while Band 34 is region 3.

6 List of band specific issues for n65
======================================

The list of band-specific issues for Band n65 are provided below.

\- General issues

\- Carrier frequency and NR-ARFCN

\- Co-existence with other 3GPP bands in Region 1 and Region 3

\- E-UTRA specific issues

\- UE

\- Network signalling and A-MPR

> \- BS

\- Co-existence with NB-IoT (MSR specification)

7 Study of E-UTRA specific issues
=================================

7.1 UE aspect issues
--------------------

n65 has to protect PHS in Region 3, which is below n65 uplink. n1 same
the same protection requirements, hence the same network signaling value
and A-MPR are applied to n65.

n65 has to protect Band 34, which is right above n65 uplink as shown in
figure 7.1-1. A-MPR study is done using applicable NR transmitter
requirements. The following scenarios are simulated, shown in figure
7.1-1.

8 Study of MSR specific issues
==============================

Because n65 is very similar to n1, the same requirements for cases when
Standalone NB-IoT carrier is located outside the BS RF are used for n65.

### 8.1 Operating band unwanted emissions 

Unless otherwise stated, the Operating band unwanted emission limits are
defined from Δf~OBUE~ below the lowest frequency of each supported
downlink operating band to the lower Base Station RF Bandwidth edge
located at F~BW\ RF,low~ and from the upper Base Station RF Bandwidth
edge located at F~BW\ RF,high~ up to Δf~OBUE~ above the highest
frequency of each supported downlink operating band. The values of
Δf~OBUE~ are defined in table 6.6-1 in TS 38.101-1 \[4\]. The
requirements shall apply whatever the type of transmitter considered and
for all transmission modes foreseen by the manufacturer\'s
specification, except for any operating band with GSM/EDGE single RAT
operation. The requirements in TS 45.005 \[3\] as defined in subclause
6.6.2.3 in TS 38.101-1 \[4\] apply to an MSR Base Station for any
operating band with GSM/EDGE single RAT operation in Band Category 2.

For BS capable of multi-band operation where multiple bands are mapped
on separate antenna connectors, the single-band requirements apply and
the cumulative evaluation of the emission limit in the Inter-RF
Bandwidth gap are not applicable.

### 8.1.1 General minimum requirement for Band Categories 1 and 3

For a Wide Area BS operating in Band Category 1 or Band Category 3 the
requirement applies outside the Base Station RF Bandwidth edges. In
addition, for a Wide Area BS operating in non-contiguous spectrum, it
applies inside any sub-block gap. In addition, for a Wide Area BS
operating in multiple bands, the requirements apply inside any Inter RF
Bandwidth gap.

For a Medium Range BS operating in Band Category 1 the requirement
applies outside the Base Station RF Bandwidth edges. In addition, for a
Medium Range BS operating in non-contiguous spectrum, it applies inside
any sub-block gap. In addition, for a Medium Range BS operating in
multiple bands, the requirements apply inside any Inter RF Bandwidth
gap.

For a Local Area BS operating in Band Category 1 the requirement applies
outside the Base Station RF Bandwidth edges. In addition, for a Local
Area BS operating in non-contiguous spectrum, it applies inside any
sub-block gap. In addition, for a Local Area BS operating in multiple
bands, the requirements apply inside any Inter RF Bandwidth gap.

Outside the Base Station RF Bandwidth edges, emissions shall not exceed
the maximum levels specified in Tables 8.1.1-1 to 8.1.1-4 below, where:

\- ∆f is the separation between the Base Station RF Bandwidth edge
frequency and the nominal -3 dB point of the measuring filter closest to
the carrier frequency.

\- f\_offset is the separation between the Base Station RF Bandwidth
edge frequency and the centre of the measuring filter.

\- f\_offset~max~ is the offset to the frequency Δf~OBUE~ outside the
downlink operating band.

\- ∆f~max~ is equal to f\_offset~max~ minus half of the bandwidth of the
measuring filter.

For a BS operating in multiple bands, inside any Inter RF Bandwidth gaps
with Wgap \< 2\*Δf~OBUE~, emissions shall not exceed the cumulative sum
of the minimum requirements specified at the Base Station RF Bandwidth
edges on each side of the Inter-RF Bandwidth gap. The minimum
requirement for Base Station RF Bandwidth edge is specified in Table
8.1.1-1 to 8.1.1-4 below, where in this case:

\- ∆f is the separation between the Base Station RF Bandwidth edge
frequency and the nominal -3 dB point of the measuring filter closest to
the carrier frequency.

\- f\_offset is the separation between the Base Station RF Bandwidth
edge frequency and the centre of the measuring filter.

\- f\_offset~max~ is equal to the inter Base Station RF Bandwidth gap
minus half of the bandwidth of the measuring filter.

\- ∆f~max~ is equal to f\_offsetmax minus half of the bandwidth of the
measuring filter.

For BS capable of multi-band operation where multiple bands are mapped
on the same antenna connector, the operating band unwanted emission
limits apply also in a supported operating band without any carriers
transmitted, in the case where there are carriers transmitted in other
operating band(s). In this case where there is no carrier transmitted in
an operating band, the operating band unwanted emission limit, as
defined in the tables of the present subclause for the largest frequency
offset (∆f~max~), of a band where there is no carrier transmitted shall
apply from Δf~OBUE~ below the lowest frequency, up to Δf~OBUE~ above the
highest frequency of the supported downlink operating band without any
carrier transmitted. And no cumulative limits are applied in the
inter-band gap between a supported downlink band with carrier(s)
transmitted and a supported downlink band without any carrier
transmitted.

Inside any sub-block gap for a BS operating in non-contiguous spectrum,
emissions shall not exceed the cumulative sum of the minimum
requirements specified for the adjacent sub blocks on each side of the
sub block gap. The minimum requirement for each sub block is specified
in Tables 8.1.1-1 to 8.1.1-4 below, where in this case:

\- ∆f is the separation between the sub block edge frequency and the
nominal -3 dB point of the measuring filter closest to the sub block
edge.

\- f\_offset is the separation between the sub block edge frequency and
the centre of the measuring filter.

\- f\_offset~max~ is equal to the sub block gap bandwidth minus half of
the bandwidth of the measuring filter.

\- ∆f~max~ is equal to f\_offset~max~ minus half of the bandwidth of the
measuring filter.

Applicability of Wide Area operating band unwanted emission requirements
in Tables 8.1.1-1, 8.1.1-1b and 8.1.1-1c is specified in Table 8.1.1-0.
