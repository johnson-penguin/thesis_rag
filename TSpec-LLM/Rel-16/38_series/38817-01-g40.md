4 General and common aspects
============================

4.1 Operating bands
-------------------

While requirements are often generic and band agnostic, there may in
many cases be separate requirements for different bands. In some cases,
these are identified directly using the band number. They will also be
references to different frequency ranges covering many bands, identified
as requirements for sub-6 GHz bands (Frequency Range 1) and mmWave bands
(Frequency Range 2). These ranges are for the purpose of the
specification defined as follows:

> \- FR1: 450 -- 6000 MHz

NOTE 1: the lower frequency limit of FR1 has been extended down to 410
MHz, from Rel-15 onwards. In order to align with the
LTE410\_Europe\_PPDR work item introducing new band in the frequency
range 410 -- 430 MHz.

NOTE 2: the upper frequency limit of FR1 has been extended up to 7125
MHz, from Rel-15 onwards. Irrespective of this decision, in this report
the FR1 is referred to as "sub‑6GHz", reflecting previous agreements on
NR spectrum.

> \- FR2: 24250 -- 52600 MHz.

The lowest frequency in FR1 is selected as the lowest frequency
identified for IMT by the ITU-R \[2\]. FR2 is defined starting from the
lowest frequency under study for IMT under WRC Agenda item 1.13, up to
the highest frequency within the scope of the present work item. In the
future when new operating bands may be added outside the frequency
ranges of FR1 and FR2, those can be incorporated by extending FR1 or
FR2, or by adding new ranges (FR3, etc.).

The definitions of FR1 and FR2 are common the UE and BS and should be
specified within clause 4 of the specifications.

As for UTRA and LTE, bands for NR are identified by band numbers. A
number of different aspects are considered for developing an NR band
numbering scheme:

> 1\) For NR in LTE "refarming" bands, whether to re-use the LTE band
> numbers for NR.
>
> 2\) For new NR bands, different alternative options are considered:
>
> a\) To put new NR bands above 6 GHz in a new separate numbering range
> within existing signaling capability.
>
> b\) To group new NR bands below 6 GHz with the LTE bands, resulting in
> separate band numbering ranges for below 6 GHz and above 6 GHz bands.
>
> c\) To assign unused numbers to all new bands on a "first come first
> served" basis, regardless of frequency range, duplex mode or RAT (LTE,
> NR, etc.)
>
> 3\) How to consider "Duplex mode" for different types of bands

The final NR band numbering scheme is based on the following:

> 1\) For NR in LTE "refarming" bands, LTE band numbers are reused for
> NR. This will be consistent with the scheme for UTRA and LTE, where
> the same number was used for the same frequency range, while written
> in a different way. It also conserves band numbers.
>
> 2\) NR band numbers will be written with a prefix "n", to distinguish
> from band numbers for other RATs. For example, NR Band n7 will
> correspond to LTE Band 7 and UTRA Band VII.
>
> 3\) New bands should be assigned band numbers on a "first come first
> served" basis in reserved frequency ranges as follows:
>
> \- 65 to 256 is reserved for new LTE and new NR bands in FR1.
>
> \- 257 to 512 is reserved for new NR bands in FR2. By avoiding LTE
> bands in this number range, the present LTE band definition is
> preserved and will most likely not need any changes in the future.
>
> \- New LTE only TDD band can use band number from existing LTE TDD
> numbering space until all numbers up to 64 are used and after that
> from the reserved 65-256 space.
>
> 4\) For both re-farming LTE bands and new NR bands, duplex mode should
> be assigned and described in band defining table (e.g. in TS 38.101
> and TS 38.104 \[7\])
>
> \- TDD for unpaired bands and FDD for paired bands
>
> \- FFS identifies options under study, such as flexible duplexing for
> paired bands
>
> \- If multiple duplexing modes are allowed in a specific frequency
> range, separate bands will be introduced with each duplexing mode

NR DC and CA band combination are defined using a notation similar to
LTE, but using the distinct notations for the different RATs: A number
(Arabic) for LTE and a number with prefix "n" for NR. The CA bandwidth
classes (postfix of the bands) for NR are defined in section 5.1.1 for
FR1 and section 7.1.1 for FR2 respectively. Examples for notations of NR
CA, DC and EN-DC are given in Table 4.1-1a, 4.1-1b and 4.1-1c.

  DC\_3-SUL\_n78-n80   LTE-NR DC between LTE Band 3, and NR bands n80 (SUL) and n78 including NR-LTE coexistence with UL sharing.

The definition of operating band can be inherited from LTE. In TS 38.101
and TS 38.104 \[7\], there should be separate tables defining the band
numbers in FR1 and FR2. This exploits the commonality within frequency
ranges and reduces table size. For FR2, the table will only contain
unpaired frequency ranges, assuming that there will be no FDD operation.
To be consistent, all frequencies are defined in MHz.

For the first version of the spec, bands listed as part of the NR WID
should be included. The new bands in Tables 4.1-3 and 4.1-4 are defined
for NR.

### 4.2.1 BS and UE channel bandwidth

For NR, the term *BS channel bandwidth* has been defined. A contiguous
block of transmit / receive spectrum may consist of one or more *BS
channel bandwidths*.

For E-UTRA, the channel bandwidth related to the transmit and receive
bandwidths of both the BS and all of the UEs with which the BS
communicates. For NR, however different *UE channel bandwidths* may be
supported within the same spectrum.

The *BS channel bandwidth* is understood to be a range of spectrum which
can be used to transmit to UEs with different bandwidths. The essential
characteristic of the *BS channel bandwidth* is that placing UEs within
the *BS channel bandwidth* is flexible; it is equally possible to assign
a single carrier to a UE covering most or all of the *BS channel
bandwidth,* to transmit a carrier to a UE with less than the *BS channel
bandwidth*, but placed anywhere within the *BS channel bandwidth* or to
transmit multiple carriers to a UE.

bandwidth within a BS channel bandwidth

It is not, on the other hand possible to transmit a carrier to a UE that
crosses the boundary between two *BS channel bandwidths.*

contiguous BS channel bandwidths. UE carriers may not straddle across BS
channel bandwidths.

How RBs used by the BS may be allocated within a BS bandwidth are
defined in the SU section 4.5 of this report.

channel bandwidths as it supports for that NR band in standalone
operation

\- Where IMD is an issue only for a subset of channel bandwidths within

higher order fallback configuration

4.3 Channel arrangement
-----------------------

### 4.3.1 RF channel and sync channel raster

#### 4.3.1.1 Background

The concept of referring to a carrier frequency in UTRA and E-UTRA is
based on a channel raster defining possible carrier centre frequencies
and a numbering scheme that identifies the raster points. In E-UTRA
there are EARFCN (E-UTRA Absolute Radio Frequency Channel Number) for
all possible uplink and downlink frequencies. The numbers are mapped to
the corresponding UL and DL carrier frequencies through formulas:

F~DL~ = F~DL\_low~ + 0.1(N~DL~ -- N~Offs-DL~)

F~UL~ = F~UL\_low~ + 0.1(N~UL~ -- N~Offs-UL~)

The possible EARFCN ranges for each E-UTRA operating band are tabulated
together with the parameters for the formula. The resulting RF channel
raster identifies all possible RF carrier centre frequencies, which are
the same as the potential frequencies that a UE must scan when
performing initial access.

The concept has many differences in NR compared to UTRA and E-UTRA,
giving a higher complexity. The main difference is that there is a need
for two channel rasters for NR:

\- **RF channel raster:** Identifies the set of possible frequency
locations of the full RF carrier transmitted by the base station.

\- **Synchronization channel raster**: Identifies the set of possible
frequency location of the SS Block, consisting the synchronization
channels PSS/SSS and the PBCH.

The SS block is not in a fixed position within the configured bandwidth
of the RF carrier, but can be placed anywhere on the RF carrier. This
enables a Sync channel raster that is more "sparse" than the RF channel
raster. The advantage of having a more sparse sync channel raster is a
reduced search time for the initial access. It relies on the SS block
bandwidth being smaller than full channel BW of the RF carrier
transmitted from the BS and that it is not in a fixed position within
the configured bandwidth. It is the width of the PBCH being 240
subcarriers (20 RBs) that will define the flexibility of how to place
the sync channel. The SS block will use a predetermined SCS and minimum
channel BW in each operating band.

The relation between the RF channel raster and sync channel raster is
demonstrated with an example in Figure 4.3.1.1-1. In the example, two
carrier positions 1 and 2 are shown leading to two different placements
of the PBCH. The PBCH (and SS) can be placed on a raster that is more
sparse than the RF carrier raster and those sync channel raster
positions are called F~SC,i~. Position 1 is the highest (rightmost)
position of BW~Confi~ on the RF channel raster where the PBCH can be
related to the sync channel position F~SC,1~, thus the PBCH occurs as
far left as possible on the carrier. Position 2 is the next position on
the RF channel raster, thus shifted by ΔF~CH,Raster~ from Position 1.
The sync channel raster spacing ΔF~SC,Raster~ will be limited by the
following equation:

ΔF~SC,Raster~ ≤ BW~Config~ -- BW~PBCH~ + ΔF~CH,Raster~ (4.3.1.1-1)

where BW~Config~ (Tx BW configuration) is the width of the transmitted
Resource Blocks, BW~PBCH~ is the width of the PBCH and ΔF~CH,Raster~ is
the channel raster spacing.

height="3.1819444444444445in"}

Figure 4.3.1.1-1: Possible shifts for the PBCH as the transmitted
carrier is shifted\
on the RF carrier raster.

#### 4.3.1.2 Overall raster concept

The RF channel raster and sync channel raster need to be defined in
relation to one or more of the following parameters:

\- **Spectrum blocks**: These are the spectrum block allocations where
the RF carriers will be placed. It is essential that the Channel BW is
fully contained within an allocated block defined and/or permitted by a
regulator, not risking "Channel BW spill-over". The regulation varies
across regions and often sets limits on emissions outside the block
assigned to an operator. The 200 kHz/100 kHz rasters used for UTRA and
E-UTRA are fundamentally adapted to spectrum blocks.

\- **Subcarrier spacing (SCS)**: The RF channel consists of subcarriers
and the subcarrier spacing becomes important for carrier aggregation and
when forming wider channel bandwidths, since the RF channel spacing
needs to be a multiple of SCS to keep orthogonality.

\- **Physical resource blocks (RB)**: The RF carrier is an integer
number of RBs and the physical channels are defined based on RBs in the
frequency domain.

The definition of the channel raster will be limited by a number of
aspects, also considering the relation between the RF channel and Sync
channel raster defined in Equation (4.3.1.1-1). The following aspects
are considered:

\- The relation to the E-UTRA **100 kHz raster** for LTE re-farming
bands.

\- How to manage the **asymmetric guard band** if the RF carrier cannot
placed in the centre of a spectrum block.

\- In case of asymmetric guard band, a **minimum guard band** needs to
be defined for different RF Channel bandwidths and SCS

\- The achievable **spectral utilization** may be affected, if the guard
band is not sufficient and an edge RB cannot be transmitted ("blanking")

\- How to achieve **CA operation** and **Wideband operation** with
forward compatibility for addition of new channel bandwidths. This
should preferably be achieved with zero guard band between carriers.

\- The achievable **synchronisation raster granularity** may be affected
by the choice of raster scheme.

NR Bands should have the same RF channel raster for both UL and DL. It
is noted however that the channel raster for UL sharing band can be
decoupled from the NR DL band raster (e.g. UL sharing band can be on
100kHz raster while the NR DL band can use 100kHz raster or RB based
raster)

#### 4.3.1.3 RF Channel raster

NR Bands should have the same raster for both UL and DL (for both UL and
DL 100kHz or RB based raster is used). Channel raster could also be
different for different bands and only a single raster should be defined
per band.

The following raster granularity is agreed:

\- Channel raster for LTE re-farming bands up to 2.4GHz (frequency range
below Band 41) is based on 100kHz(same as LTE)

\- Potential optimization for of the placement of secondary carrier
including RB-alignment between primary and secondary carrier is ffs

\- Channel raster for Bands above 2.6GHz (above and including Band 41)
is tentatively agreed to be a subcarrier based raster (i.e 15kHz for
range 1 and 60kHz for range 2), pending further check at AN4 NR AH\#3
and RAN1 decision

\- Band n85 (SUL band covering the same frequency range as n41) will use
the channel raster defined for SUL bands which is ffs.

"Floating sync" enables SCS based raster and down selection of the sync
raster for bands using 100kHz raster as described in subclause 4.3.1.4.

For the 100 kHz based raster:

\- Raster entries are given by the following equation for each band

\- Lower band edge(MHz)+ N\*0.1MHz, N chosen such that last entry is at
Upper band

\- Raster to subcarrier position mapping

\- Raster points to the center of the channel

\- SC\#0 of RB\# NRB/2 for even number of RBs

\- SC\#6 of RB\# floor(NRB/2) for odd number of RBs

For the SCS-based raster:

\- Raster will be based on absolute frequency values

\- The raster positions will be integer multiples of 15kHz for sub6
bands

\- The raster positions will be integer multiples of 60kHz for mmWave
range bands

\- Raster entries are indexed from 0kHz

\- Raster to subcarrier position mapping

\- Raster points to the center of the channel

\- SC\#0 of RB\# NRB/2 for even number of RBs

\- SC\#6 of RB\# floor(NRB/2) for odd number of RBs

NR-ARFCN defines the absolute radio frequency of the channel raster
points and is globally defined; The frequency band and duplex (uplink or
downlink) are not distinguished by the NR-ARFCN. It is for RAN2 to
decide how to signal the frequency of Pcell, Scell, SUL, and/or the
reference frequency for PRB grid, etc, using NR-ARFCN or other
means.NR-ARFCN for FR1 are defined as one global set from 0 Hz to
24 GHz:

\- An integer multiple of 5kHz from 0 to 3GHz

\- An integer multiple of 15kHz from 3 to 24GHz

NR-ARFCN for FR2 are defined as one global set from 24 GHz to 100 GHz

\- An integer multiple of 60kHz

NR-ARFCN range for each frequency band is tabulated in RAN4 specs. The
corresponding signalling is for RAN2 to design.

#### 4.3.1.4 Synchronization Channel raster

Sync raster is defined such that there is a minimum number of entries
for each band. Sync raster entries will be included in the
specifications for each band. Sync raster entries will be defined for
initial system acquisition, sync blocks can be transmitted in other
frequency locations if the position is signalled to the UE

The sync block is not RB aligned with the data RBs in the channel as
shown in Figure 4.3.1.4-1. Instead, there is an arbitrary offset between
the edge of the sync block RBs and the edge of the data RBs in the
channel, this offset can be up to 11 REs. This enables multiple channels
that are subcarrier grid aligned but not RB grid aligned to use the same
sync block location. Different channels that are offset by up to 11 REs
in frequency can re-use the same sync block frequency location.

height="2.4611111111111112in"}

Figure 4.3.1.4-1: Alignment between SS block and channel RBs.

Subcarrier mapping:

\- Sync raster will indicate the position of RE=\#0(subcarrier \#0) of
RB\#10 of the SS block.

SS Raster Definition for the 0 -- 3.0 GHz range:

\- SS Raster is defined as

\- Raster entry = N \* 1200 kHz + M \* 50 kHz, N=1:2499, M ϵ {1,3,5}\
(For operating bands with SCS spaced channel raster, the value M=3 is
used.)

\- Raster entry numbering in this range is in increasing order of
frequency, starting numbering at \#2 (entry \#2=1250 kHz, entry
\#3=1350 kHz, entry \#4=1450 kHz, entry\#5=2450 kHz...)

\- Total number of entries 7497

\- Raster applies to bands with 100 kHz channel raster and 15 kHz
channel raster with 5 MHz minimum bandwidth (bands might be defined in
the future) in this frequency range

SS Raster Definition for the 3.0 - 24.25 GHz range:

\- SS Raster is defined as:

\- Raster entry = 3000 MHz + N \* 1.44 MHz, N= 0: 14756

\- Raster entry numbering is in increasing order of frequency, starting
at 7499

\- Total number of entries 14757

\- Raster applies to bands with 15 kHz channel raster and 10 MHz minimum
bandwidth (n77,n78, n79, etc) in this frequency range

SS Raster Definition for the 24.25-100GHz range

\- SS Raster is defined as:

\- Raster entry = 24250.08 MHz + N \* 17.28 MHz, N= 0:4383

\- Raster entry numbering is in increasing order of frequency, starting
at 22256

\- Total number of entries 4384

\- Raster applies to bands with 60 kHz channel raster in this frequency
range

#### 4.3.1.5 Calculations of sync raster GSCN per operating band

For each operating band, the GSCN that can be used in the band are
tabulated in subclause 5.4.3.3 of TS 38.104 \[7\], TS 38.101-1 \[4\] and
TS 38.101-2 \[5\]. Selection of GSCN for Table(s) is done the following
way:

\- Include GSCN that correspond to SS block that completely fit within
the channel bandwidth, accounting for guard bands needed.

\- Guard bands are calculated based on the minimum channel BW in table
5.3.5-1 and table 5.3.5-2 of TS 38.104 \[7\], the SCS for the SS block
and the corresponding N~RB~ (spectrum utilization), assuming that the SS
block can be in any position within the transmission BW configuration,
including at positions adjacent to the edges.

\- For GSCN ranges with step size \<N\>, the GSCN numbers selected
should be multiples of N (this ensures that overlapping bands will have
the same GSCN sequences)

For specific combinations of minimum channel bandwidth and SS block SCS,
the GSCN ranges are down-selected using a step size \<N\>, as shown in
Table 4.3.1.5-1.

Table 4.3.1.5-1: Down selection factors (step size).

To determine the GSCN range, let *f*~min~ denote the lowest frequency
location of the SS block within a band after accounting for the guard
band *G* in subclause 5.3.3 of TS 38.104 \[7\] corresponding to the
minimum channel BW and the bandwidth encompassing the width of all
subcarriers from RE\#0 of RB\#0 to the centre of RE\#0 of RB\#10 of the
SS block. Let *f*~max~ denote the high frequency location of the SS
block within a band after accounting for the guard band and the
bandwidth from the centre of RE\#0 of RB\#10 and encompassing the width
of all subcarriers until RE\#11 of RB\#19 of the SS block. Let *F*~low~
represent the lowest frequency of the frequency range in subclause
4.3.1.4, ∆*F*~raster~ represent the raster spacing in MHz, ∆*F*~shift~
represent the raster shift in MHz (applicable for the frequency range 0
to 3000MHz).

The lowest frequency location *f*~min~ is computed as

$f_{\text{min}} = F_{\text{low}} + G + \mathrm{\Delta}f\left( \frac{N_{\text{RB}}^{\text{SS}}N_{\text{RE}}^{\text{RB}} + 1}{2} \right)$

where $\mathrm{\Delta}f$ is the subcarrier spacing,
$N_{\text{RE}}^{\text{RB}} = 12$ is the number of REs per RB,
$N_{\text{RB}}^{\text{SS}} = 20$ is the number of RBs in the SS block.

The highest frequency location *f*~max~ is computed as

$f_{\text{max}} = F_{\text{low}} + W_{\text{Band}} - G - \mathrm{\Delta}f\left( \frac{N_{\text{RB}}^{\text{SS}}N_{\text{RE}}^{\text{RB}} - 1}{2} \right)$

where *W~Band~* is the width of the operating band.

The first possible raster location within a band (prior to applying the
step size) is given by

$f_{\text{min}} \leq F_{\text{low}} + N{\mathrm{\Delta}F}_{\text{raster}} + M{\mathrm{\Delta}F}_{\text{shift}}$

while the last possible raster location within a band (prior to applying
the step size) is given by

$f_{\text{max}} \geq F_{\text{low}} + N{\mathrm{\Delta}F}_{\text{raster}} + M{\mathrm{\Delta}F}_{\text{shift}}$

where ∆*F*~shift~ is defined to be 0 outside the frequency range 0 to
3000MHz and where N (and M) are defined in subclause 4.3.1.4.

For the first possible raster location, *N*~min~ is the smallest integer
satisfying

$N_{\min} \geq \frac{1}{{\mathrm{\Delta}F}_{\text{raster}}}\left( f_{\text{min}} - F_{\text{low}} - max\left( M \right){\mathrm{\Delta}F}_{\text{shift}} \right)$

and the corresponding value of M (if defined and if multiple values are
defined)

$M \geq \frac{1}{{\mathrm{\Delta}F}_{\text{shift}}}\left( f_{\text{min}} - F_{\text{low}} - N_{\min}{\mathrm{\Delta}F}_{\text{raster}} \right)$

For the last possible raster location, *N*~max~ is the largest integer
satisfying

$N_{\text{max}} \leq \frac{f_{\text{max}} - F_{\text{low}} - \text{min}\left( M \right){\mathrm{\Delta}F}_{\text{shift}}}{{\mathrm{\Delta}F}_{\text{raster}}}$

and the corresponding value of M (if defined and if multiple values are
defined)

$M \leq \frac{f_{\text{max}} - F_{\text{low}} - N_{\text{max}}{\mathrm{\Delta}F}_{\text{raster}}}{{\mathrm{\Delta}F}_{\text{shift}}}$

For the frequency ranges in subclause 4.3.1.4, table 4.3.1.5-2 indicates
the formulas used to compute the values of N and M (if necessary).

To compute the GSCN ranges with step size \<N\>, the N and M (when
defined) values computed with the formulas in table 4.3.1.5-2 are used
to determine GSCNmin′ and GSCNmax′ according to the appropriate raster
entry formula from subclause 4.3.1.4. The first entry in the GSCN range,
GSCNmin, is determined by

$\text{GSCNmin} = \left\langle \text{N} \right\rangle\left\lceil \frac{\text{GSCNmin}'}{\left\langle \text{N} \right\rangle} \right\rceil$

and the last entry in the range, GSCNmax, is determined by

$\text{GSCNmax} = \left\langle \text{N} \right\rangle\left\lfloor \frac{\text{GSCNmax}'}{\left\langle \text{N} \right\rangle} \right\rfloor$.

Note that GSCN in some bands may be defined according to deployment need
instead of using the equations in this clause.

### 4.3.2 Channel spacing for adjacent NR carriers

The spacing between carriers will depend on the deployment scenario, the
size of the frequency block available and the channel bandwidths. The
nominal channel spacing between two adjacent NR carriers shall be
multiple of channel raster. As such, the channel spacing should be
specified separately for different channel raster and additional offset
may be needed pending on channel raster and different channel bandwidth
combination for adjacent NR carriers.

### 4.3.3 Channel spacing for intra-band CA

For LTE intra-band contiguous CA, the following assumptions are
considered:

\- the aggregated bandwidth shall be no more than BW~Channel(1)~
+BW~Channel(2)~

\- the outer guard bands of the two CCs are symmetric.

\- the channel spacing shall be multiple of LCM (least common multiple)
of channel raster and SCS ( i.e. 300 kHz of 100kHz channel raster and
15kHz SCS for LTE), this is to be compatible with the channel raster and
at the same time to maintain the orthogonality of the sub-carriers
spacing.

Above three assumptions could be reused for NR intra-band contiguous CA
although there are some following differences between LTE and NR:

\- Minimum guard band of the outermost carriers should be used, rather
than fixed guard bands (= 0.05\*BW) for each channel bandwidth

\- The channel raster of 100kHz, 15kHz and 60kHz are supported.

\- Several SCSs are supported

Considering the combination of channel raster and SCS for each carrier,
the NR intra-band contiguous CA channel spacing should be separately
defined correspondingly. In order to be compatible with the channel
raster and the orthogonality of the sub-carriers spacing, the NR CA
channel spacing shall be multiple of LCM of channel raster and SCS,
listed in table 4.3.3-1.

+----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+

The channel spacing for intra-band contiguous carrier aggregation can be
adjusted to any multiple of least common multiple of channel raster and
sub-carrier spacing less than the nominal channel spacing to optimize
performance in a particular deployment scenario.

4.4 Subcarrier spacing
----------------------

### 4.4.1 Non-SS channels

NR supports operation of different numerologies involving different
sub-carrier spacings, as well as operation in different parts of the
frequency domain.

The subcarrier spacing used for non-SS transmission impacts several
aspects of performance, including:

\- The maximum channel bandwidth that can be supported using a feasible
FFT size

\- Larger subcarrier spacing implies larger bandwidth

\- The inter-carrier interference due to phase noise

\- Larger subcarrier spacing implies greater phase noise robustness

\- The symbol length and hence delay characteristics

\- Larger subcarrier spacing implies shorter symbols

The characteristics of range 1 and range 2 in terms of achievable phase
noise, channel delay profiles and expected bandwidths differ
considerably and hence the supported SCS options were decided separately
for range 1 and range 2. Several options for SCS are supported for each
range. The SCS supported for each band will be selected on a band
specific basis from the options defined for the corresponding range.

The SCS options were decided to be as follows:

Table 4.4-1 Non-SS subcarrier spacing options

  **Frequency range**    **SCS options (Non-SS)**
  ---------------------- --------------------------
  Range 1 (Below 1GHz)   15, 30 kHz
  Range 1 (Above 1GHz)   15, 30, 60 kHz
  Range 2                60, 120 kHz

4.5 Spectrum utilization
------------------------

### 4.5.1 General

In order to settle spectrum utilization for NR, a number of factors have
been taken into account, including:

\- Increasing the spectrum utilization compared to E-UTRA

\- The spectrum efficiency gains corresponding to the spectrum
utilization increase

\- The impact of the spectrum utilization on implementations, including
both filtering and windowing solutions to spectrum confinement

\- The impact of the spectrum confinement technique needed for achieving
the spectrum utilization on signal quality (EVM), both across the band
and at the band edges

\- The impact of the spectrum utilization on receiver performance
considering ACS, phase noise reciprocity

\- Relevant requirements on SEM, ACS etc.

\- Expected transmitter power

Whilst defining a single set of spectrum utilization values in Rel-15
for both UL and DL, three co-existence scenarios were considered for
spectrum utilization as depicted in figure 4.5.1-1. In the figure, X% is
defined as utilization required to be achievable with the Rel-15
requirements. Y% is defined as utilization not required to be achievable
with the Rel-15 requirements.

![](media/image9.wmf){width="5.33125in" height="1.863888888888889in"}

Figure 4.5.1-1 Coexistence scenarios for two adjacent NR channels

From TX side, BS/UE is expected to always meet all TX requirements such
as EVM, out-of-band emission requirements (SEM and ACLR) and spurious
requirements for the Rel-15 utilization X%. Thus, BS/UE TX and RX
requirements were developed for scenario 1.

In addition, it was noted that for a co-ordinated operator deployment,
scenarios 2 and 3 may be possible on a "system level" (i.e. from BS
perspective). Operating in such a manner could potentially cause
interference to other operators, this depends on the scenario.

\- Note that this does not require higher spectrum utilization from the
UE perspective. More specifically, for such scenarios UE TX / RX
baseband processing capabilities are limited by the X% resource
utilization and UE may not support higher utilization.

\- The impacts to interference, blocking etc. to neighbouring operators
will need to be considered and managed by the operator taking into
account the specific deployments of the different operators.

Consideration was also given to how to accommodate future potential RAN4
minimum requirements for Y% utilization in scenarios 2 and 3.

\- A RAN4 minimum requirement for higher spectrum utilization Y% would
be considered only if it could improve system and/or user throughput
compared to X% . How to evaluate system and user throughput would need
study.

\- Feasibility and complexity cost would also need to be considered when
evaluating RAN4 minimum requirement for higher spectrum utilisation in a
future release

\- If future analyses would justify the introduction of minimum higher
spectrum utilization Y%:

\- Later release specification and requirements impact is FFS

\- The same BS/UE Tx Rel-15 requirements will continue to be applicable.
(i.e. No impact on BS/UE TX and RX Rel-15 requirements defined for X% ).

\- If needed, relevant BS/UE RX minimum requirements could be
revised/added.

\- Whether Y% would be mandatory for BS/UE or not would be FFS in the
future release

EVM requirements measured over edge PRBs is FFS. RB values for NR
spectrum utilization are agreed based on the assumption of no edge PRB
EVM requirements in Rel-15.

RAN1 and RAN2 confirmed that physical layer and L2/3 signalling supports
allocation of PRBs up to the theoretical maximum number for the channel
bandwidth.

### 4.5.2 Maximum RB Allocation, Transmission Bandwidth and Spectrum Utilization for FR1

#### 4.5.2.1 CP-OFDM waveform

Spectrum Utilization refers to the proportion of the channel bandwidth
that can be used for transmission. RAN4 defined a single set spectrum
utilization values in Rel-15 for both UL and DL. The following maximum
RB allocation defines the minimum spectrum utilization to be realized
per channel bandwidths and valid sub-carrier spacing.

Transmit bandwidth for CP-OFDM can be significantly different across the
different sub-carrier spacing for a given channel bandwidth, this must
be taken into account for UE REFSENS thermal noise integration bandwidth
as it results in some cases into close to 1dB REFSENS improvement for
the higher numerologies.

  NOTE 1: 70MHz and 90MHz are defined only as BS channel bandwidths in release 15.                                                                                                                                            

The minimum requirements in RAN4 are met with the agreed spectral
occupancy under the condition that the BS or UE channel bandwidth centre
is placed at SC 0 or SC 6 of the PRB grid such that the PRB utilization
is symmetrical around the channel centre for the SCS under test.

For the UE, both the channel bandwidth and the position of the PRB grid
with respect to the UE channel bandwidth centre depend upon
configuration. In some configurations, the centre of the UE channel
bandwidth may not align with the PRB grid in a manner that enables
symmetric PRB utilization around the centre. For the BS, when multiple
SCS are transmitted then the rule that SC 0 should align over all SCS at
a point A can mean that the PRB alignment with the channel centre is not
ideal for some SCS and asymmetry may arise.

In these cases, the PRB utilization is the set of PRBs that fall within
the UE or BS channel bandwidth and do not violate the minimum guard
band, as captured in the tables below, and depicted in figure 4.5.2.1-1.

The minimum guard bands have been calculated using the following
equation: (CBW x 1000 (kHz) - RB value x SCS x 12) / 2 - SCS/2

RB numbering for DFT-s-OFDM waveforms is the same than the RB number for
CP-OFDM it is aligned with. In the case where DFT-s-OFDM maximum RB
allocation is smaller than the CP-OFDM maximum allocation, all positions
within the CP-OFDM allocation are valid. This implies that RBstart
values can be higher than the maximum allocation for DFT-s-OFDM. The
valid RB start values follow the following equation:

RBstart DFT-s-OFDM range = 0 to (CP-OFDM maxRB) -- (DFT-s-OFDM \#RB)

For DFT-s-OFDM, when the maximum allocation is smaller than for CP-OFDM
the transmit bandwidth is smaller, as a consequence the UE spectrum
utilization can be smaller for DFT-s-OFDM than for CP-OFDM and in most
cases equivalent to LTE.

### 4.5.4 Sub-carrier alignment with DC and between numerologies and their impact to guard bands for FR1

From RAN1 agreement, the lowest valid SCS allocation must be such that
one sub-carrier is aligned with DC (channel centre). This results in a
shift of ½ SCS for the lowest valid SCS for a given channel bandwidth.
Similarly, the different SCS in a given channel bandwidth, must have
their sub-carrier 0 aligned for all numerologies. The following table
provides the lowest numerology RB number for which the RB0 sub carrier 0
aligns with the lowest numerology sub carrier 0. This alignment is valid
for the case where the reference SCS is the lowest valid SCS.

### 4.5.5 Spectrum utilization when operating multiple numerologies

The flexible NR design enables optional frequency multiplexing of
transmissions with different subcarrier spacing within the same carrier.
If this is the case, then a spectrum occupancy must be calculated taking
into account both numerologies. In release 15, for the UE this agreement
relates to determining spectrum utilization where SRB and PDSCH have
different numerologies and are frequency division multiplexed. For the
BS, transmission or reception may be made with multiple numerologies.

In such cases, at each side of the carrier, the guard size is selected
corresponding to the numerology operated immediately adjacent to the
carrier edge and the bandwidth of the whole carrier. In the example
below, if the carrier bandwidth would be e.g. 20MHz, then on the left
hand side the guard would be the guard corresponding to 15kHz SCS and
20MHz bandwidth and the guard on the left hand side would be the guard
corresponding to 60k SCS and 20MHz bandwidth. The guard sizes would not
depend on the proportion of the carrier allocated to each numerology.
(Note that the figure does not imply anything about the size of any
guard between the numerologies; the inter-numerology guard within the
same carrier is implementation dependent).

Figure 4.5.x-1 Example of multiple numerology transmission

When following this agreement, the possibility exists that the BS or UE
channel bandwidth may be larger than the maximum bandwidth supported by
one of the numerologies that is next to the carrier edge. For example, a
100MHz carrier may be transmitted with a 10MHz, 15kHz SCS allocation
adjacent to the edge of the carrier. For these situations, a guard band
size is defined as follows:

\- For FR1, if multiple numerologies are multiplexed in the same symbol
and the BS channel bandwidth is \>50MHz, the guardband applied adjacent
to 15k SCS shall be the same as the guardband defined for 30k SCS for
the same BS channel bandwidth.

\- For FR2, if multiple numerologies are multiplexed in the same symbol
and the BS channel bandwidth is \>200MHz, the guardband applied adjacent
to 60k SCS shall be the same as the guardband defined for 120k SCS for
the same BS channel bandwidth.

4.6 Mixed numerology requirements
---------------------------------

### 4.6.1 Mixed Numerologies FDM operation use cases

A potential feature of NR is that the BS may transmit data using
multiple numerologies in the same sub-frame using frequency division
multiplexing. It has been agreed that in release 15, UEs will not be
required to be able to receive data on multiple numerologies. If
different parts of the same carrier are used for transmitting different
numerologies, then the numerologies will not be fully orthogonal.
Potentially, filtering or windowing could be used to achieve isolation
between numerologies. In band emissions or EVM requirements, and
receiver selectivity requirements could be considered to improve the
inter-numerology isolation.

Two use cases for mixed numerology operation were discussed:

\- Use Case \#1: Data and Data mixed numerology FDM

\- FDM'ed transmission or reception of physical channels (e.g. NR PDSCH,
PDCCH, PUSCH, PUCCH) with different numerologies at the same instance in
DL or UL

\- Use Case \#2: Data and SS block (SS, PBCH) mixed numerology FDM

\- FDM'ed transmission or reception of SS block (SS/PBCH) and other
physical channels (e.g. NR PDSCH, PDCCH) with different numerologies in
DL

### 4.6.2 Data/Data mixed numerology FDM operation

The need for introducing RF requirements for isolating numerologies in
such scenarios was investigated. The following conclusions were reached:

BS requirements:

\- FDMed mixed numerologies for downlink and uplink data channel from BS
perspective can be supported without additional in-band RF requirements
compared to single numerology.

\- UE shall be able to TX and RX with one of these numerologies.

UE requirements:

\- Case 1 mixed numerology FDM can be supported without additional UE
in-band RF requirements compared to single numerology (e.g. via using
inter-numerology guard bands)

\- Do not define in-band UE RF requirements for Case 1 mixed numerology
FDM in Rel-15

\- FFS if any additional mixed numerologies requirements need to be
introduced in future releases

The decision was based around the following observations:

\- For systems performing beamforming, spatial isolation between
different users/numerologies may be achieved

\- Inter-numerology interference does not impact performance at low to
medium SINR

\- At high SINR, the gNB scheduler can mitigate inter-numerology
interference by means of allocating a guard between the numerologies;
this would be an implementation decision

RAN4 also made the following working assumption: Rel-15 NR UE is not
mandated to support simultaneous DL reception or UL transmission of
multiple FDM'ed physical channels (e.g. NR PDSCH, PDCCH, PUSCH, PUCCH)
with different numerologies at the same time instance.

### 4.6.3 Data/SS mixed numerology FDM operation

Transmission of SS and data using different numerologies is needed in
systems supporting a different data numerology to the SS. Similar to the
data/data case, there may exist interference between the SS and data
numerologies. The following decisions were made:

\- Data/SS mixed numerology FDM operation can be supported for both
BS/UE without additional in-band RF requirements compared to single
numerology.

\- Do not define dedicated BS and UE in-band RF requirements in Rel-15
related to Data/SS mixed numerology FDM.

\- Support of simultaneous reception of Data/SS with mixed numerologies
is optional from UE implementation perspective.

\- RAN4 will investigate further how UE RRM requirements will take this
into account

\- Case 1: Intra-frequency cell identification and measurements on the
target cell while receiving Data from the serving cell with different
numerology from SS

\- Other cases are not precluded

The decision was based around the following observations about
interference of data onto SS:

\- The SS is designed for cell search to function at low SINR. In
general, inter-numerology interference is not significant

\- One potential case in which the interference could be more
significant is the case in which data is transmitted using a very narrow
beam in the same direction as a user who is attempting to detect SS from
the same basestation, and the SS beam is wider. In this case, data may
be received with higher power than the SS. However, this scenario only
occurs when the user performing cell search is in the same direction as
the user to whom data is transmitted, which is low probability and the
associated degradation is not seen as significant.

and following observations around the degradation on data caused by SS

\- Since the SS beam sweeps and is not transmitted in all subframes, any
interference from SS onto data is only for a limited portion of the time

\- Data is likely to be always transmitted with the same or grater
beamforming gain than SS

\- Any interference from SS is only significant at high SINR

\- If there is any risk of interference to a high SINR user from SS
during a subframe, the gNB scheduler can mitigate the interference by
leaving a guard between the two as an implementation decision.

5 UE Transmitter characteristics (frequency range 1)
====================================================

5.1 General
-----------

### 5.1.1 CA Bandwidth Class

For intra-band contiguous carrier aggregation, a carrier aggregation
configuration is a single operating band supporting a carrier
aggregation bandwidth class with associated bandwidth combination sets.
For each carrier aggregation configuration, requirements are specified
for all aggregated channel bandwidths contained in a bandwidth
combination set, A UE can indicate support of several bandwidth
combination sets per carrier aggregation configuration.

For intra-band non-contiguous carrier aggregation, a carrier aggregation
configuration is a single operating band supporting two or more
sub-blocks, each supporting a carrier aggregation bandwidth class.

For inter-band carrier aggregation, a carrier aggregation configuration
is a combination of operating bands, each supporting a carrier
aggregation bandwidth class.

Table 5.1.1-1 gives the proposed NR CA bandwidth class for FR1.

  NOTE: If the uplink/downlink configuration is 0 or 6, the requirements for power class 2 are not applicable, and the corresponding requirements for a power class 3 UE shall apply.                                         

For UE with two transmit antenna connectors in closed-loop spatial
multiplexing scheme, the maximum output power for any transmission
bandwidth within the channel bandwidth is specified in Table 5.2.1-2.

If UE is configured for transmission on single-antenna port, the
requirements in Table 5.2.1-1 apply.

### 5.2.2 MPR /A-MPR

### 5.2.3 UE maximum output power for modulation / RB allocation

For UE Power Class 3, the allowed Maximum Power Reduction (MPR) for the
maximum output power in Table 5.2.1-1, due to higher order modulation
and transmit bandwidth configuration (resource blocks) is specified in
Table 5.2.3-1. The Maximum Power Reduction is constant across channel
bandwidths up to 100MHz and all valid sub-carrier spacing and only
depends on modulation type and order and RB allocation type: Outer RB
allocations see higher MPR than Inner RB allocations, except for 64QAM
and 256QAM where a single MPR value applies to any RB allocation.

Where the following parameters are defined to specify valid RB
allocation ranges for Outer and Inner RB allocations:

> L~CRBmax~ is the maximum number of RB for a given Channel bandwidth
> and sub-carrier spacing derived from from spectrum utilization.
>
> RB~startLow~ = L~CRB~/2 rounded down to next integer with floor at 1
>
> RB~startHigh~ = L~CRBmax~ -- RBs~tartLow~ -- L~CRB~

Where Inner RB allocation range is specified as follows: Inner RB
allocation are L~CRB~/2 away from each edge of the maximum RB allocation
for all L~CRB~ ≤ L~CRBmax~/2 rounded up to the next integer~.~

RB~startInner~ : valid RB~start~ values for Inner RB allocations

> For L~CRB~ ≤ L~CRBmax~/2 rounded up to the next integer, RB~startLow~
> ≤ RB~startInner~ ≤ RB~startHigh~

Where Outer RB allocation range is all allocations which are not Inner

### 5.2.4 Inner RB allocation range for all 5MHz -- 100MHz channel bandwidths and SCS

Figure 5.2.4-1 is illustrating Outer RB allocations in orange and Inner
RB allocation in yellow for the two valid SCS for 5MHz channel. On the
left side the two triangles correspond to the CP-OFDM allocations with
15kHz SCS in the lower left and 30kHz on the upper right, similarly, the
same triangles for DFT-s-OFDM allocation can be found on the right side
of the figure.

Table 5.2.4-1 provides the valid Inner RB allocation RB~start~ range for
channel bandwidths and SCS having a L~CRBmax~ range of 11 to 51 for the
different RB allocation lengths L~CRB~ ≤ L~CRBmid~. The yellow
highlighted column corresponds to the inner RB allocation of the 15kHz
and 30kHz SCS 5MHZ channels described in Figure 5.2.4-1.

Table 5.2.4-2 provides the valid Inner RB allocation RB~start~ range for
channel bandwidths and SCS having a L~CRBmax~ range of 52 to 133 for the
different RB allocation lengths L~CRB~ ≤ L~CRBmid~.

Table 5.2.4-3 provides the valid Inner RB allocation RB~start~ range for
channel bandwidths and SCS having a L~CRBmax~ range of 135 to 273 for
the different RB allocation lengths L~CRB~ ≤ L~CRBmid~.

RBsL is the lowest valid RB~start~ value for Inner RB allocations

RBsH is the highest valid RB~start~ value for Inner RB allocations

For the CA requirement, the following is the current definition.

*For inter-band carrier aggregation with uplink assigned to two E-UTRA
bands and intra-band contiguous and non-contiguous carrier aggregation,
the minimum controlled output power of the UE is defined as the transmit
power of the UE per component carrier, i.e., the power in the channel
bandwidth of each component carrier for all transmit bandwidth
configurations (resource blocks), when the power on both component
carriers are set to a minimum value.*

And each carrier requirement is defined as the single carrier
requirement, i.e. -40 dBm.

For the minimum output power, it should be noted that -30 dBm is the
minimum output power that can support 256QAM modulation.

6.5.2.1.1-2 of TS 36.101 \[3\])

#### 5.3.1.2 NR requirement

For the NR requirement, there could be two approaches being considered.
The first is that all of the CBW reuses the same level requirement as
LTE. The second is that the CBW enlarge can be treated as the LTE CA
then the minimum output power can be defined as the same PSD with LTE
20MHz.

The first approach tightens the UE implementation if UL SNR is
considered. If 100MHz reuses 20MHz absolute level, i.e. -40 dBm for
QPSK, 16QAM, 64QAM modulation and -30 dBm for 256QAM modulation, the SNR
decreases 7 dB which is a large improvement request to the link design.
When LTE UL256QAM was discussed, the link budget was very tough that 7
dB improvement is a big challenge.

According to current TS 36.101 \[3\] arrangement, the UL 256QAM
challenge was not reflected in the minimum output power section but in
the EVM clause. Therefore, the same approach was used in the
requirement. The following requirements were agreed for NR minimum
output power.

### 5.4.3 In-band emissions

Based on analysis general section of LTE in-band emission mask
requirement can be largely re-used for NR when the evaluation period is
changed to be longer and the interference power is measured average
power. Reason for this is that when OFDM becomes clipped by the PA, the
caused IBE spikes are basically impulsive noise. Hence the IBE of a
single slot is quite noisy and vary between the slots. When multiple
slots are measured and average value is calculated this instantaneous
variation between the slots is averaged out. Impact of using 10 subframe
test time vs one slot test time can be seen in Figure 5.4.3-1 which
shows the histogram of in-band emission at a single RB as offset from
the limit value. Hence, positive values indicate violation of the
in-band limit. Without averaging, the standard deviation of the
measurement result is large, and the measurement is unreliable.
Therefore, NR Range 1 in-band emission measurement period is specified
to be 10 sub-frames. The in-band emission is averaged over slots.

Figure 5.4.3-1: Effect of averaging in-band emission over one slot vs.10
subframes, i.e., 20 slots.

The third expression of the general IBE limit (-57 dBm/180 kHz) takes
into account the subcarrier spacing. In LTE, the -57 dB refers to the
180 kHz bandwidth of a single RB. In NR, this must be scaled to maintain
the same spectral density for all SCSs. This modification is established
by adding +10Log~10~(SCS/15 kHz) term into the IBE formula, see Table
5.4.3-1 where SCS is the applicaple subcarrier spacing.

### 5.5.1 Occupied bandwidth

### 5.5.2 Spectrum emission mask

#### 5.5.2.1 General spectrum emission mask

LTE general SEM and LTE CA general SEM the emission requirement for the
first MHz outside the channel edge is scaled proportionately to the
channel bandwidth. Logic behind this is that as transmission bandwidth
gets larger the PSD of fully populated channel gets lower and UE can
meet the tighter requirement. It is noted than from co-existence
perspective this is not needed as smaller channel bandwidths are anyways
allowed to emit more and system must work also with those channels.

However scaling cannot continue forever due to the fact that some small
allocations (1RB) inside the channel are mixing with LO and image and
create IMD3 that lands on the first MHz outside the channel. It can be
seen from simulations that with 25 dBc IQ-Image performance IMD3 created
by 1 RB transmission is in the order of -22 dBm/30 kHz. This would
violate then SEM for larger channel bandwidth if scaling is continued to
all channel bandwidths.

Thus it is safest that scaling is not used for channel bandwidths \> 40
MHz for NR general SEM for sub-6 GHz bands. For those regions that have
regulatory requirements for emissions to first MHz outside the channel
region specific SEMs can be defined similarly as for LTE.

NR Sub-6 GHz general emission mask is presented in Table 5.5.2.1-1.

#### 5.5.2.2 Additional spectrum emission requirements

Additional spectrum emission requirements are signalled by the network
with network signalling value indicated by the field
*additionalSpectrumEmission*.

##### 5.5.2.2.1 Requirements for network signalled value \"NS\_04\"

Additional spectrum emission requirements are signalled by the network
to indicate that the UE shall meet an additional requirement for a
specific deployment scenario as part of the cell handover/broadcast
message.

The n41 SEM transition point from -13 dBm/MHz to -25 dBm/MHz is based on
the emission bandwidth. The emission bandwidth is defined as the width
of the signal between two points, one below the carrier center frequency
and one above the carrier center frequency, outside of which all
emissions are attenuated at least 26 dB below the transmitter power.
Since the 26 dB emission bandwidth is implementation dependent, the
transmission bandwidths occupied by RBs is used for the SEM.

### 5.5.3 Adjacent Channel Leakage ratio

Concerning NR Range 1 UE ACLR requirement following agreements have been
made

#### 5.5.3.1 NR ACLR

ACLR is the ratio of power of wanted signal to the power falling into
Adjacent Channel. ACLR measurement bandwidth for both the wanted and
adjacent channels is the maximum transmission bandwidth among the
different SCSs of CP-OFDM SU for a channel BW with addition of one SCS
to account for half SCS shift due to SCS alignment to DC, this
measurement bandwidth is centred within the channels.

Offset for the adjacent measurement BW centre is +/- Channel BW from
wanted channel centre (in the middle of the Channel).

For PC3 requirement is NRACLR = 30 dBc for channel bandwidths up to 100
MHz.

For PC2 requirement is NRACLR = 31 dBc for channel bandwidths up to 100
MHz.

#### 5.5.3.2 E-UTRA ACLR

For E-UTRA ACLR it has been agreed that if EUTRA CHBW = NR CHBW only the
NR ACLR of 30 dBc shall be measured. This means that for channel
bandwidths up to 20 MHz it is not necessary to measure E-UTRA ACLR as NR
ACLR is tighter because the requirements in same 30 dBc but measurement
bandwidth is larger.

Considering recent agreement on NR ACLR which stated that ACLR MBW is
same as the bandwidth of transmitted NR signal it is evident that E-UTRA
ACLR is always more relaxed thus is not necessary.

Therefore, no E-UTRA ACLR requirement is not specified for NR as NR ACLR
requirement will be always more stringent.

#### 5.5.3.3 UTRA ACLR

For bands defined also for UTRA, adopt UTRAACLR1 = 33dB and UTRAACLR2
=36dB for power class 3.

UTRA ACLR requirement is indicated to the UE by NS-signalling when
applicable. Dedicated NS-value is assigned to UTRA ACLR requirement and
it is used when no other additional requirement needs to indicated to
the UE.

In case power reduction is necessary to meet the UTRA ACLR requirement
it will be defined as A-MPR~UTRA\_ACLR~. A-MPR~UTRA\_ACLR~ is only
allowed only in case other power reductions such as MPR and A-MPR coming
from other requirement than UTRA ACLR are not sufficient. Allowed power
reduction = Max (A-MPR~UTRA\_ACLR~, (MPR+A-MPR~other~).

### 5.5.4 Spurious emission

#### 5.5.4.1 General requirements

Spurious emissions are emissions which are caused by unwanted
transmitter effects such as harmonics emission, parasitic emissions,
intermodulation products and frequency conversion products, but exclude
out of band emissions unless otherwise stated.

In the same way as was described for UTRA and E-UTRA, the spurious
emission limits shall be specified in terms of general requirements in
line with SM.329.And the stricter Category B limits defined in SM.329
shall be applied for UE considering that UEs are intended for global
circulation, there cannot be any regional requirements. Thus, the
following spurious emission limits for E-TRUA would be reused in NR.

In LTE, the boundary between out of band and Spurious emission is
BW~Channel~ + 5MHz for all bandwidth (channel bandwidth and CA
bandwidth) more than 5 MHz, which is derived from the table 5.5.4-2
cited from ITU-R SM.1541 by assigning *BU* to be 5 MHz and changing the
starting position of the offset from the centre of channel bandwidth to
the edge of channel bandwidth.

+----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+

The above guideline in SM.1541 and SM.329 should be also followed to
define spurious domain for NR range 1. In NR, the minimum channel
bandwidth is 5 MHz, thus similar to E-UTRA, the boundary (F~OOB~)
between OOB and spurious for NR Range 1 shall be also BW~Channel~ + 5
MHz for all possible channel bandwidth for NR range 1.

#### 5.5.4.2 Spurious emission band UE co-existence

#### 5.5.4.3 Additional spurious emissions

These requirements are specified in terms of an additional spectrum
emission requirement. Additional spurious emission requirements are
signalled by the network to indicate that the UE shall meet an
additional requirement for a specific deployment scenario as part of the
cell handover/broadcast message.

##### 5.5.4.3.1 Minimum requirement (network signalled value \"NS\_04\")

When \"NS 04\" is indicated in the cell, the power of any UE emission
shall not exceed the levels specified in Table 5.5.4.3.1-1. This
requirement also applies for the frequency ranges that are less than
F~OOB~ (MHz) in Table 5.5.2.2.1-3 from the edge of the channel
bandwidth.

5.6 Transmit intermodulation
----------------------------

UE transmitting in close vicinity of each other can produce
intermodulation products, which can fall into the UE, or eNode B receive
band as an unwanted interfering signal. Although various uplink signals
from other UEs in the same area, for instance NR UL signal, LTE UL
signal, UMTS UL (FDD or TDD) or GSM/GPRS signal, can be an interference
signal for the interested UE, interference signal of CW (continuous wave
signal) would give a good indication on UE intermodulation .thus
,similar to LTE, The UE intermodulation attenuation shall be defined by
the ratio of the mean power of the wanted signal to the mean power of
the intermodulation product on wanted signal when an interfering CW
signal is added at a level below the wanted signal at each of the
transmitter antenna port with the other antenna port(s) if any is
terminated. In addition, considering the similar deployment scenario of
the NR and E-UTRA for sub 6GHz,it is reasonable the level of the CW
Interference signal should be kept as -40dBc (same as in LTE).

Similar with UMTS and LTE, the transmitter intermodulation requirements
should be specified in conjunction with ACLR requirements. Namely Tx
intermodulation level measured in the interested adjacent channel is not
masked by the contribution of the ACLR. In that case, the
intermodulation requirements can be estimated through ACLR requirement
and inherent Tx intermodulation, which can be shown by the following
equation:

Intermodulation requirement=10lg (10^-ACLR/10^+10^inherent\ TX\ IM/10^)

For UMTS and LTE case, inherent Tx intermodulation of -35 dBc (with
interferer CW at 20 MHz offset) and -45 dBc (with interferer CW at
40 MHz offset) are assumed. considering most of LTE RF equipment (such
as PA, front-end filter, duplexer) shall be reused for NR especially
when reframing LTE band, the nonlinearity characteristic will be roughly
the same between LTE signal and NR signal. Thus, it can be expected
above inherent Tx intermodulation values could be reused for NR. Since
the requirements of NR ACLR is defined as NR ACLR= 30 dBc for channel
bandwidth up to 100 MHz, the following intermodulation level (Tx IM
\[measured\]) would be applied. it shall be noted that the
intermodulation product level in the table is aligned with LTE. The
measurement bandwidth of intermodulation product and wanted signal
should follow the same principle as NR ACLR MPR assumption i.e. an
available maximum transmission bandwidth among the SCSs for a channel
BW.

5.7 ON/OFF time mask
--------------------

### 5.7.1 UE transient time

For NR, the following three different transient time parameters are
defined as below:

> \- **ON-to-ON time**: ON-to-ON time refers to switching time related
> to change of power between consecutive UL transmissions. Other
> switching time requirements due to e.g. antenna switching, frequency
> hopping which require PLL retuning, beam switching, etc are discussed
> separately.
>
> \- **ON-to-OFF time**: ON-to-OFF time refers to time required for
> switching from ON state to OFF state for a transmitter.
>
> \- **OFF-to-ON time**: OFF-to-ON time refers to time required for
> switching from OFF state to ON state for a transmitter.

Following transient times are defined for FR1 in Table 5.7.1-1:

5.8 Additional UE RF Tx requirements for SUL and LTE-NR co-existence
--------------------------------------------------------------------

It should be noted that simultaneously LTE and NR UL transmission in one
carrier or one band is almost unfeasible in Rel-15 because MPR is very
hard to determine for this case. So in the following, it is assumed that
LTE and NR transmissions are not simultaneously configured in one
carrier or one band.

### 5.8.1 Transmit power

For standalone SUL with non-simultaneous transmission, transmit power
requirement can be applied separately for UL and SUL carrier. Then for
configured transmit power, as the UL carrier and SUL carrier share a
same cell, the configured transmit power should be specified for each UL
carrier in a serving cell. The requirement for each UL carrier can reuse
the definition of configured transmit power for serving cell in general
NR.

For LTE-NR DC with SUL, the transmit power related requirements can
reuse the general DC transmit power related requirements, only the
configured transmit power for the serving cell with SUL carrier shall
apply the configured transmit power for each UL carrier in the serving
cell for non-simultaneous transmission.

### 5.8.2 Output power dynamics

As LTE and NR should not be simultaneously transmitted in one carrier or
one band, the requirements of minimum/OFF output power, time mask and
power control should be kept unchanged, and LTE and NR requirements can
be applied separately.

In addition, a new requirement of time mask between LTE and NR
slot/subframe boundary needs to be specified for DC scenarios since UE
needs to switch from LTE to NR and vice versa to maintain two
connections for both LTE and NR on the shared carrier when operating in
TDM based UL sharing from the UE perspective.

For LTE, 20us transient period is needed for each slot at the boundary.
And for NR, only 5us is needed for each slot at the boundary. For LTE,
there is difference between the mask with PUSCH and SRS in the last
symbol because SRS is high priority and need to be protected. However,
for LTE to NR switching in TDM based UL sharing from the UE perspective,
this kind of protection of SRS is not needed because LTE can configure
no SRS in this specific subframe. So there is no need to specify
multiple time masks for LTE to NR switching in UL sharing from the UE
perspective.

For TDM based UL sharing from the UE perspective with LTE/NR switching
at slot boundary, time masks combined with LTE and NR requirements are
illustrated in Figure 5.8.2-1 for almost 0us switching time.

TDM based UL sharing from the UE perspective for type1 UE with switching
time 0.5us

By ways of configuring cell-specific SRS subframes in LTE, we can make
the LTE last symbol vacant with no transmission of either PUSCH or SRS.
In LTE, SRS does not have to be configured for transmission in all
cell-specific SRS subframes. In which subframe SRS is transmitted by a
UE is according to UE specific SRS configuration. Therefore, the 20us
switching time can be placed in LTE subframe for LTE/NR switching in the
TDM based UL sharing from the UE perspective because it will not degrade
either LTE or NR performance through certain configuration.

For TDM based UL sharing from the UE perspective with LTE/NR switching
on the shared carrier at slot boundary, time masks combined with LTE and
NR requirements are illustrated in Figure 5.8.2-2 for less than 20us
switching time.

### 5.8.3 Transmit signal quality

On the condition that LTE and NR transmissions are not simultaneously
configured in one carrier or one band, the requirement of frequency
error, EVM and in-band emission should be kept unchanged, and LTE and NR
requirements can be applied separately.

It should be noted that for SUL, the downlink reference comes from
another band. However, as the local crystal oscillator should be
calibrated with the relative error of 0.1ppm, all the output of the PLL
including the TX RF PLL should be also locked with the relative
frequency error of 0.1ppm. So the maximum allowed frequency error for
SUL can be defined as 0.1ppm.

For the carrier leakage requirement, the carrier leakage rejection
should be kept unchanged, and LTE and NR requirements can be applied
separately. However, it should be noted that the carrier leakage
frequency is still under discussion for NR, and whether it still should
be at the carrier frequency is FFS.

For NR-LTE co-existence, in order to achieve sub-carrier alignment
between LTE and NR, the channel raster for NR may be shifted by 7.5kHz
compared to general NR channel raster, in this case the carrier leakage
frequency may or may not at the carrier frequency in order not to
exclude any implementations.

### 5.8.4 Output RF spectrum emissions

On the condition that LTE and NR transmissions are not simultaneously
configured in one carrier or one band, these requirements should be kept
unchanged, and LTE and NR requirements can be applied separately.

### 5.8.5 Transmit intermodulation

On the condition that LTE and NR transmissions are not simultaneously
configured in one carrier or one band, these requirements should be kept
unchanged, and LTE and NR requirements can be applied separately.

6 UE Receiver characteristics (frequency range 1)
=================================================

6.1 General
-----------

6.2 Receiver Sensitivity
------------------------

For below 6GHz, the REFSENS level can be calculated by the equation
below:

Sensitivity = -174dBm(kT) + 10\*log(R~X~ BW) + NF + SNR +IM -- diversity
gain

**It is noted that the Rx BW is identical to the transmission bandwidth
configuration, which is determined by the spectrum utilization. The RB
values in the analysis of this contribution are based on the agreed SU
for NR.**

**SNR in Nagoya meeting was tentatively agreed as -1dB, the tentative
value is the same as that for LTE. However, SNR will be further
evaluated by link level simulation. Actually,** the SNR under AWGN
channel has no difference for different SCS and the demodulation
performance for DFT-s-OFDM and CP-OFDM is the same as well. Therefore,
the same SNR will be used to calculate REFSENS for different SCS.

The REFSENS for E-UTRA assumes that the receiver is equipped with two Rx
port as a baseline. If 2Rx is considered, the diversity gain is 3dB and
the Implementation Margin (IM) uses 2.5dB. In the following calculation,
same assumptions are used for LTE refarming bands for NR.

The NF for the NR bands can reuse those for E-UTRA. For the three new NR
bands, i.e. Bands n77\~79, the agreed NR values are 10.5dB, 10dB and
10dB respectively.

The REFSENS values for 15kHz, 30kHz and 60kHz SCS are provided in Table
6.2-1 to Table 6.2-3. It is noted that the REFSENS values are subjected
to changes due to the final determined SNR.

  Note 1: indicates that the requirement is modified by -0.5 dB when the carrier frequency of the assigned E-UTRA channel bandwidth is within 865-894 MHz.                                                                                                                                                      

When we define the REFSENS for these values for E-UTRA, due to the close
frequency range between UL and DL, REFSENS for some CBWs are relaxed,
i.e. 1 dB relaxation for 15MHz and 20MHz CBW for Band 20, 1.5dB
relaxation for 20MHz CBW for Band 28, and 0.4dB relaxation for 15MHz and
3.7dB for 20MHz for Band 71.

As SU for NR is increased compared to that of E-UTRA, the relaxation for
these bands may need to be further enlarged. Currently, the same
relaxation values are tentatively used for these NR bands, thus the
values are put in brackets in the tables.

The other aspect needs to be considered for REFSENS is the uplink
configuration. For NR bands, the similar constrains on the UL RB
allocation as those for E-UTRA can be considered as well, however, the
new SU shall be considered in determine the uplink configurations. Some
principles are considered to derive the UL RB allocation in Table 6.2-4:

1\. The full RB allocation for counterpart E-UTRA CBW will be extended
for NR based on new SU

2\. For the CBW with RB allocation constraints but without REFSENS
relaxation, the RBs will be adjusted based on NR SU, e.g. for E-UTRA
Band 3, 50 RB is utilized for 15MHz CBW, thus the RB will be adjusted to
52RB for NR Band n3 for the same CBW.

3\. For the E-UTRA band with REFSENS relaxation for some CBWs, the same
RB allocations for 15kHz SCS will be kept for the counterpart NR band.

4\. For 30kHz and 60kHz SCS, if full RB allocation cannot be supported
for the CBW, the floor value most close to the transmission BW
configuration of 15kHz SCS will be adopted.

Table 6.2-4 gives the uplink configuration for NR REFSENS for the
proposed NR bands.

### 7.1.1 CA Bandwidth Class

For intra-band contiguous carrier aggregation, a carrier aggregation
configuration is a single operating band supporting a carrier
aggregation bandwidth class with associated bandwidth combination sets.
For each carrier aggregation configuration, requirements are specified
for all aggregated channel bandwidths contained in a bandwidth
combination set, A UE can indicate support of several bandwidth
combination sets per carrier aggregation configuration.

For intra-band non-contiguous carrier aggregation, a carrier aggregation
configuration is a single operating band supporting two or more
sub-blocks, each supporting a carrier aggregation bandwidth class.

For inter-band carrier aggregation, a carrier aggregation configuration
is a combination of operating bands, each supporting a carrier
aggregation bandwidth class.

Table 7.1.1-1 gives the proposed NR CA bandwidth class for FR2.

7.2 Transmit power
------------------

### 7.2.1 Power Class

Power class of FR2 UEs is specified as a package of the minimum peak
EIRP, maximum allowed TRP, maximum allowed EIRP and spherical coverage.

[Minimum Peak EIRP Requirement:]{.underline}

The peak EIRP is the maximum EIRP capability of UE to all directions and
represents the beam forming capability of UE. Unlike LTE, where each UE
power class is specified as a nominal value with +/- tolerance, mmWave
UE peak EIRP requirement only specifies a lower limit, i.e., no power
class-dependent peak EIRP upper limit is specified. UE meets the
requirement as long as it exceeds the defined limit in one direction
and, since the requirement is only lower limit, no tolerance is
specified.

[Maximum TRP/EIRP Requirement:]{.underline}

On the other hand, an upper limit of TRP requirement is introduced in
conjunction with EIRP-based power class to constrain UL co-channel
interference. This encourages UE to achieve as better as possible EIRP
performance by implementation improvement without causing additional
co-channel interference. Some countries/regions have regulatory
requirement on the maximum allowed EIRP for the mmWave UE. The
requirement depends on UE types. For handheld UE that is supposed to be
carried by people, a lower maximum allowed EIRP is required. But a
higher EIRP is allowed for other UE types to enable higher data rates
and better coverage. To meet the regulatory requirement, the requirement
for the maximum allowed EIRP is captured. The requirement varies
depending on UE type and the peak EIRP shall not exceed the maximum
allowed value.

[Spherical Coverage Requirement]{.underline}

The spherical coverage requirement is defined by EIRP value at certain
percentile on the CDF curve, where the percentile depends on power class
(i.e., UE type). The reason to specify UE type-dependent percentile is
because different UE types may have different applicable sphere area,
e.g. for some UE types, a specific portion of its radiation sphere may
be blocked and the spatial coverage requirement on the blocked
directions should be excluded.

The CDF curve is obtained by plotting the measured EIRP on test
directions with uniform surface density over the whole sphere even if
the target beam coverage area for certain UE type is less than 100%
sphere. The spherical coverage requirement assures that UE can transmit
EIRP no lower than the defined EIRP limit over the required percentile.

The power class is used to distinguish different UE types and each power
class corresponds to a single UE type. Several UE types were identified
and their power class were specified as summarized in Table 7.2.1-1.

Table 7.2.1-1: Classification of UE Types

  3                Handheld UE following US FCC 43dBm EIRP power limit

##### 7.2.1.1.3 Spherical coverage requirement 

**[How to derive the requirement]{.underline}**

Fixed Wireless Access UE is installed on outside wall of building by
professional, who can guarantee the direction difference between ideal
boresight beam direction and LOS direction from FWA UE to gNB be well
controlled within the angle of half beam width. Therefor the target beam
coverage of power class 1 was allowed limited area of sphere.

Specifically, based on knowledge of FR2 CPE device deployment, it is
expected that the beam coverage area should be +/-50 degree, i.e., the
top sphere area with $\theta \leq 50{^\circ}$in elevation direction
provided that the boresight direction is along with z-coordinate.

Figure 7.2.1.1.3-1: Beam coverage area, i.e., top sphere area with
θ≤50°in elevation direction

With the simple math for sphere area, the beam coverage area is 17.8% of
total surface area of sphere i.e.,
$\frac{2\pi r^{2}\int_{0}^{\theta = 50{^\circ}}\text{sinθdθ}}{4\pi r^{2}} = 17.8\%$.
To reserve certain margin for the outer range of beam coverage area, it
was derived to use 85%-tile requirement for EIRP CDF of FWA's spherical
coverage performance.

The minimum allowed min Peak EIRP at 85%-tile CDF is derived from the
simulation which evaluate an achievable Spherical Coverage Performance.
Based on the 4x4 array panel by which one direction is covered, the
following beamforming pattern can be simulated, where beams with 39
directions are utilized for the beam coverage area with θ≤50°in
elevation direction. Two observation angles are shown in below figures.

![](media/image16.png)![](media/image17.png)

Figure 7.2.1.1.3-2: Beam coverage area, i.e., top sphere area with
θ≤50°in elevation direction

It can be observed that the antenna gain achieved by beams in the
outermost beam layer can be at least 3dB less than the center boresight
direction, while the boundary areas between individual beams can be
further degraded with the amount as much as around 6-7 dB.

CDF plot of achievable antenna gain based on ideal simulation
environment is provided in the following figure, in which around 4dB
degradation from peak direction can be observed at 85%-tile CDF point,
i.e., 13.18dB at 85%-tile from 17dB in peak direction. In other words,
the beam scanning loss without radome into account could be 4dB.

![](media/image18.png)

Figure 7.2.1.1.3-3: CDF of ideal antenna gain for 4x4 panel at 28GHz,
5.5mm element-spacing in both x- & y-directions

Furthermore, additional radome loss should also be considered, which
arises when beam is steered away from boresight direction considering
radome material can be beam-direction dependent and this loss has not
been reflected in above simulation for ideal propagation environment.
Based on our understanding and experience, at least 2.5dB should be
reserved for this additional radome loss. Finally, additional 1.5dB
should be reserved for implementation margin, to account for mmWave
radiation distortion, practical design options for directional beam book
design, and inaccuracy of pre-coder implementation etc.

As a summary, it was proposed to have 8.0dB at 85%-tile from peak EIRP
value, with the breakdown of 8.0 dB as below:

Scan Loss w/o Radome: \~4 dB

Additional Radome Loss: 2.5 dB

Implementation Margin: \~1.5 dB

**[Conclusion]{.underline}**

The minimum EIRP at the 85^th^ percentile of the distribution of
radiated power measured over the full sphere around the UE is defined as
the spherical coverage requirement and is found in Table 7.2.1.1.3-1
below.

##### 7.2.1.3.3 Spherical coverage requirement

**[How to derive the requirement]{.underline}**

Vehicle Mounted UE is attached on a body or a rooftop of a motor
vehicle. Therefor the target beam coverage is limited half sphere
because the body of vehicle blocks off radiation from vehicle mounted UE
at the body side of the contact face. The spherical coverage requirement
is originally agreed as 20%-tile on half spherical coverage. However,
the definition of spherical coverage is full sphere so that spherical
coverage of power class 2 is redefined at 60%-tile on full spherical
coverage. This does not mean to relax the requirement. Practically EIRP
at blocked side of vehicle should be sufficiently small and original
requirement of half spherical coverage should be satisfied.

The value at CDF percentile of 20% (for half spherical) coverage was
obtain to evaluate CDF of antenna gain for 28GHz based on the half
sphere as show in Figure 7.2.1.3.3-1.

height="3.032638888888889in"}

Figure 7.2.1.3.3-1: Antenna gain for Power class 2 UE

Based on the above CDF curves, it was proposed to define the required
EIRP corresponding to 20% CDF percentile of the half spherical coverage
considering some implementation margin, it was defined as 11dB at
20%-tile from peak EIRP value for half spherical coverage, i.e. 18dBm.

**[Conclusion]{.underline}**

The minimum EIRP at the 60^th^ percentile of the distribution of
radiated power measured over the full sphere around the UE is defined as
the spherical coverage requirement and is found in Table 7.2.1.3.3-1
below.

  NOTE 1: We encourage companies to provide implementation losses and P1d numbers for nominal and worst cases to facilitate the analysis of nominal and minimum definitions of max EIRP; the current RAN4 agreement is to define power class as the minimum of the max EIRP without tolerance

##### 7.2.1.4.3. Spherical coverage requirement

**[How to derive the requirement]{.underline}**

Due to study the sensitivity of the network performance to the EIRP
percentile, outage performance and throughput performance were evaluated
through system simulation. Network simulation assumptions are found in
Table 7.2.1.4.3-1.

To understand the sensitivity of the network performance to the 50%-tile
value, the EIRP was degraded by several dB for all UEs whose EIRP
percentile is lower than 50%. In another sets of simulations, the EIRP
was reduced as same for all UEs whose EIRP percentile is lower than 20%.
By comparing the outage and throughput loss performances, it was
observed that the network performance was less sensitive to the
variations of EIRP at 20%-tile and slightly decreased at 50%-tile case.
Therefor several companies suggested that defining the spherical
coverage requirement at 20%-tile value for Power class 3 is impractical
but should be specified at not smaller than 50%-tile value. On the other
hand, due to lack of sufficient measurement experience, there was the
opinion not to be specified below 50%-tile. After discussion, percentile
of spherical coverage for Power class 3 was agreed as 50%-tile.

Based on above evaluation, several companies proposed 50%-tile value.
But there was a variety of assumptions for the reported data and some
was based of simulations, while a few were based on measurements. To
help analyze the data, two tables are provided below summarizing the
50%-tile values for 1 panel and 2 panels. After discussion, spherical
coverage in one power class is one specification. Finally, minimum EIRP
at 50%-tile CDF is defined as 11.5dBm for 28GHz and as 8dBm for 39Hz.

##### 7.2.1.5.3 Spherical coverage requirement 

**[How to derive the requirement]{.underline}**

The spherical coverage requirement is originally agreed as 20%-tile on
half spherical coverage. The value at CDF percentile of 20% coverage was
obtain to evaluate CDF of antenna gain for 28GHz as show in Figure
7.2.1.5.3-1.

height="3.4347222222222222in"}

Figure 7.2.1.5.3-1: Simulated CDF of EIRP at 28GHz

Based on the above CDF curves, it was proposed to define the required
EIRP corresponding to 20% CDF percentile considering some implementation
margin, it was defined as 9dB at 20%-tile from peak EIRP value. Similar
approach has been undertaken for 39GHz band.

**[Conclusion]{.underline}**

The minimum EIRP at the 20^th^ percentile of the distribution of
radiated power measured over the full sphere around the UE is defined as
the spherical coverage requirement and is found in Table 7.2.1.5.3-1

7.2A Transmit power for CA
--------------------------

### 7.2A.1 Void

### 7.2A.2 Maximum power reduction for CA

FR2 enables very wideband aggregated channel bandwidths for CA. For
Release 15, RAN4 has agreed to limit contiguous UL CA to 800 MHz of
aggregated bandwidth, and up to 8 CCs. Non-contiguous intra-band UL CA
was deemed out of Rel-15 scope, but non-contiguous DL CA is defined with
frequency separation of up to 1400 MHz (see Table 6.2A.2.2-1 of TS
38.101-2 \[5\]). In the FR2 UE, because of the wide bandwidths, most
stages of analog cricuitry have gain that is not constant over
frequency. The baseband section in particular has gain droop which
increases as a function of baseband BW. These gain slopes and droops
play a prominent part in determining MPR, especially for wide baseband
BWs.

Some UEs employ a common LO for both, UL and DL, for frequency
translation of the signal between RF and baseband. Since, in FR2 CA, a
CC can be configured either only for DL, or for both, UL and DL, the
configured frequency span from the lowest edge of the lowest CC edge to
the highest edge of the highest CC ('instantaneous bandwidth') in the UL
may be significantly different from that of the DL. For these UEs, the
baseband BW is not determined by the individual instantaneous bandwidths
in either the UL or DL, but by the *aggregate* of the instantaneous
bandwidths. This quantity is termed the *cumulative aggregated channel
bandwidth,* and is defined in TS 38.101-2 \[5\] as the frequency band
from the lowest edge of the lowest CC to the upper edge of the highest
CC of all UL and DL configured CCs.

Note that for UEs that employ a common LO for both, UL and DL, CA MPR is
applicable even when the UL is not configured for CA, but the DL is
configured for CA. Figure 7.2A.2-1 shows the principle.

Figure 7.2A.2-1: Gain limitation in TX lineup for large *cumulative
aggregated channel bandwidth*

Consider a UE with a common LO for UL and DL, sized to deliver full
power when a single 400 MHz channel is configured. This operation
corresponds to a baseband BW of 200MHz. In a CA mode that supports
1400 MHz of DL instantaneous bandwidth, the required operational
baseband BW is 700 MHz for both UL and DL. This UE will suffer power
droop '∆G' for UL CCs that happen to be configured at one of the edges
as shown, which in turn drives MPR for this condition.

UEs with other LO implementations are not precluded. MPR requierments
derived for UEs with common LO are automatically inclusive of UEs with
other LO implementations.The justification is below:

For UEs with fast LO switching, or with dedicated LOs for Tx and Rx
paths, UL signal path bandwidth can cover only the configured UL
component carreirs instead of cumulative aggregate bandwidth. For these
UEs, with CA configured per figure 7.2A.2-1, UL signal path is centered
at the frequency range covering only the UL component carriers , as
shown in figure 7.2A.2-2. These UEs do not have larger gain droop in the
UL path, which in turn represents one less factor that forces PA back
off by having tigher LO retuning implementation or doubling the number
of LOs, compared to UEs with common LO.

7.3 Output power dynamics
-------------------------

### 7.3.1 Minimum output power

For the NR requirement on frequency range 2, it is agreed that

> \- 13dBm for EIRP regardless of channel bandwidth up to 400MHz from
> system level perspective.
>
> \- Considering efficiently, linearity for mmWave PA implementation,
> the minimum output power level is relaxed by \[3\] dB and \[7\] dB for
> EVM test for 16QAM and 64QAM.

The NR UE minimum output power requirement for frequency range 2 is
defined in Table 7.3.1-1 and 7.3.1-2.

7.5 Output RF spectrum emissions
--------------------------------

### 7.5.1 Occupied bandwidth

### 7.5.2 Spectrum emission mask

### 7.5.3 Adjacent Channel Leakage ratio

### 7.5.4 Spurious emission

#### 7.5.4.1 Protection of earth exploration-satellite service

The International Telecommunication Union World Radiocommunication
Conference 2019 (WRC-19) created an internationally recognized 24.25 to
27.5 GHz band aiming at primary mobile allocation for licensed/IMT
networks deployments. In addition to it, the limits of unwanted emission
power from active service stations in that band were specified to
protect 23.6-24 GHz EESS (passive) band.

A summary of the WRC-19 agreement related to EESS unwanted emission
limits is given below \[13\]:

For 5G Base stations:

\- -33 dBW in any 200 MHz of the EESS (passive) band for IMT/5G base
stations brought into use before 1st September 2027.

\- -39 dBW in any 200 MHz of the EESS (passive) band for IMT/5G base
stations brought into use after 1st September 2027.

\- The -39 dBW/200 MHz limit will not apply to 5G base stations which
have been brought into use prior to this date.

\- For those base stations, the limit of -33 dBW/200 MHz will continue
to indefinitely apply after this date.

For 5G User equipment:

\- -29 dBW in any 200 MHz of the EESS (passive) band for IMT/5G user
equipment brought into use before 1st September 2027.

\- -35 dBW in any 200 MHz of the EESS (passive) band for IMT/5G user
equipment brought into use after 1st September 2027.

\- The -35 dBW/200 MHz limit will not apply to UEs which have been
brought into use prior to this date.

\- For those UEs, the limit of -29 dBW/200 MHz will continue to
indefinitely apply after this date.

NOTE 1: these out-of-band emission limits are equally applicable to all
license holders within the band.

The relation between \"active service band\" and 3GPP bands is
illustrated in Figure 7.5.4.1-1 below. NR band n258 frequency ranges
from 24.25 to 27.5 GHz, which is identical to the aforementioned WRC
active service band. Furthermore, 3GPP band n257 partially overlaps with
\"active service band\", and thus ideally should be also considered
while analysing potential specification impact.

Combining the WRC-19 outcome with the existing spurious emissions
requirements in TS38.101-2, Table 7.5.4.1-1 summarizes the common
understanding of emissions requirements globally and regionally.

Because of the delayed implementation of Requirement 3 from Table

release, such that the timing of UEs achieving certification according
to that release and the timing of the WRC-19 regulation coming into
effect is aligned.

When we introduce new NS(s) into already existing band(s), there would
be two types of UE existing in a real environment: one is UE working
with an existing NS and the other is UE working with a new NS. In such a
case, two issues were indentified \[R4-2000220, R4-2003241\]. One issue
is if BS cannot know which NS values each of UEs can support, there
would be connectivity issues for the cases of Pscell addition in NSA and
handover in both SA and NSA. Another issus is that if BS cannot set
appropriate NS to UE, then the UE may violate regulation.

To address this issue, WF \[R4-2005738\] approved the direction that BS
should know which NS values each of the UEs can support, and listed
possible solutions. In RAN4\#95-e, it was approved to take Alt
1-2(Explicit signaling for a UE to report newly supported NS value(s)
for a legacy band to the network (reuse modifiedMPR bits)) described in
WF \[R4-2009141\]. By using Alt 1-2, connectivity issues can be avoided.
In addition, it was also agreed that newly introduced NS is mandatory
for UE brought into use at least after the changeover date, which can
avoid the situation where UE may violate regulation.

In RAN4\#97-e, CR was agreed to introduce NS\_203 and explicit signaling
for a UE to report newly supported NS value(s) for a legacy band to the
network through modifiedMPR bits \[R4-2016785\]. The description of
modifiedMPRbehavior indication for NS\_203 is captured in table
7.5.4.1-4. Note that NS\_20X and NS\_20Y described in Table 7.5.4.1-3
have not yet been specified in TS 38.101-2 v15.14.0. The same approach
with introduction of NS\_203 should apply to these NSs according to
approved WF \[R4-2009141\], i.e., Alt 1-2(Explicit signaling for a UE to
report newly supported NS value(s) for a legacy band to the network
(reuse modifiedMPR bits)) should be used and newly introduced NS is
mandatory for UE brought into use at least after the changeover date.
And when these NSs should be introduced can be discussed in the future
if requesed.

### 7.7.1 UE transient time

Similar to FR1, three different transient times are defined for FR2. The
definition of these three transient time parameters is described in the
section 5.7.1.

The following transient times are defined for FR2 in Table 7.7.1-1:

7.8 Beam correspondence
-----------------------

### 7.8.1 General

Beam correspondence is the ability of the UE to select a suitable beam
for UL transmission based on DL measurements with or without relying on
UL beam sweeping. The beam correspondence requirement is satisfied
assuming the presence of both SSB and CSI-RS signals and Type D QCL is
maintained between SSB and CSI-RS.

### 7.8.2 Beam correspondence for PC1

### 7.8.3 Beam correspondence for PC2

### 7.8.4 Beam correspondence for PC3

The detailed formulation of the general beam correspondence requirement
for PC3 and the beam correspondence tolerance requirement for PC3 is
provided in TS 38.101-2 \[5\]. This clause contains the simulation
assumptions and simulation results that are used to derive the beam
correspondence tolerance requirement.

The simulation assumptions are shown in Table 7.8.4-1 below.

The procedure to model the beam correspondence impairments and to
generate the CDF of ∆EIRP is as follows:

\- Set ideal analog beam weight table (AWT) for K beams, where the
number of beams depends on UE implementation

\- AWT = \[**W**~1~ **W**~2~ **W**~3~ ... **W**~K~\]

\- Let the composite antenna pattern for given Q direction with Wk beam
vector, as defined in TR 38.803 \[10\], be A(Q, **W**~k~)

\- For each P UEs, where P is the number of UEs to be simulated:

\- Generate Tx/Rx AWT considering phase and amplitude error per element
(if using Model 1):

\- Tx AWT = \[**W**~T1~ **W**~T2~ **W**~T3~ ... **W**~TK~\], where K is
one of \[8, 16, 32\]

**- W**~TK~ = **W**~K~ \* δ~ak~ \* exp(i δ~pk~)

\- Rx AWT = \[**W**~R1~ **W**~R2~ **W**~R3~ ... **W**~RK~\] = \[**W**~1~
**W**~2~ **W**~3~ ... **W**~K~\]

\- Generate Tx/Rx AWT considering phase and amplitude error per beam (if
using Model 2):

\- Tx AWT with error = \[**W**~T1~ **W**~T2~ **W**~T3~ ... **W**~TK~\],
where K is one of \[8, 16, 32\]

\- Rx AWT = \[**W**~R1~ **W**~R2~ **W**~R3~ ... **W**~RK~\] = \[**W**~1~
**W**~2~ **W**~3~ ... **W**~K~\]

\- Relationship between Tx/Rx AWT: A(Q, **W**~k~) = A(Q+δ~pk~,
**W**~Rk~) + δ~ak~

\- For given measure point (Q) within EIRP measurement grid (iterate
until statistically meaningful measurement values are obtained)

\- Determine UE autonomous DL (Rx) beam selection (EIRP~1~)

\- Beam Index(k) = index of max(RSRP~1~+∆~1~, RSRP~2~+∆~2~,
RSRP~3~+∆~3~, ... RSRP~K~+∆~K~)

\- Beam Index(k) = index of max(A(Q, **W**~R1~)+∆~1~, A(Q,
**W**~R2~)+∆~2~, A(Q, **W**~R3~)+∆~3~, ... A(Q, **W**~RK~)+∆~K~)

\- EIRP~1~ = A(Q, **W**~TK~)

\- Determine UE EIRP~2~:

\- Size of SRS AWT is restricted by *SRS-resource* of M = 8

\- The common understanding for UL beam sweeping operation is the
following:

\- If UE does not configure the *spatialRelationInfo* from NW, then the
UE can consider the UL beam sweeping.

\- If UE has configure the *spatialRelationInfo* from NW, then the UE
consider autonomous beam selection

\- *spatialRelationInfo* contain the ID of a reference 'ssb-Index' or
'csi-Rs-Index' for SRS resource

\- SRS AWT = \[**W**~SRS\_T1~ **W**~SRS\_T2~ **W**~SRS\_T3~ ...
**W**~SRS\_TM~\] is a subset of Tx AWT; how to select the subset is up
to UE implementation

\- EIRP~2~ = max(A(Q, **W**~SRS\_T1~), ..., A(Q, **W**~SRS\_TM~)) (beam
sweeping and select best)

\- ∆EIRP = EIRP~2~ -- EIRP~1~

\- After calculating ∆EIRP at all measurement grid points, generate CDF
of ∆EIRP

\- Correction for the sine of the elevation angle is used when
generating the CDF of ∆EIRP (same approach as the EIRP CDF generation)

\- Company should guarantee EIRP~2~ can fulfill all applicable
requirements (Clause 6.6 of TS 38.101-2 \[5\])

\- The impact on the 50%-tile of the EIRP CDF can be estimated as the
average difference in the 50%-tile values between EIRP~1~ CDF and
EIRP~2~ CDF over the P simulation trials

\- The beam correspondence tolerance value Y is defined as the 85%-tile
of the ∆EIRP CDF

The summary of simulation results is provided in Table 7.8.4-2 below.

B.7 Simulation description
==========================

Adopt following simulation steps. If companies find issues in the
following simulation steps, we can revisit in RAN4\#80bis. Note:
detailed simulation description is captured in Section 5.1.5 TR25.942.

1\) Aggressor and victim network are generated.

2\) CPE associations: CPE are associated to base station based on
coupling loss.

\- Associations are made assuming a single element at both CPE and BS.

3\) Once association is done, round robin scheduling is used. BF weights
are adjusted to point to the LOS direction between BS-CPE. This done for
both victim and aggressor networks.

4\) SINR Throughput are measured in the victim systems without
considering ACI, i.e.
$\text{Thput}_{\text{NO~ACI}}\left\lbrack \text{bpshz} \right\rbrack = f\left( \text{SINR}_{\text{ICI}} \right) = f\left( \frac{S}{N + I_{\text{ICI}}} \right)$,
where $I_{\text{ICI}}$ is the inter-cell interference.

5\) SINR and throughput are computed considering ACI:
$\text{Thput}_{\text{ACI}}\left\lbrack \text{bpshz} \right\rbrack = f\left( \text{SINR}_{ICI + ACI} \right) = f\left( \frac{S}{N + I_{\text{ICI}} + I_{\text{ACI}}} \right)$,
where $I_{\text{ACI}}$ is the adjacent channel interference.

6\) RF parameters are determined based degradation cause by ACI:
$\text{Los}s_{\text{ACI}} = 1 - \frac{\text{Thput}_{\text{ACI}}}{\text{Thput}_{\text{SINGLE}}}$.

B.8 Evaluation metric
=====================

Assume scaled Shannon\'s formula specified in TR 36.942 \[9\] with
following parameters.

  ---------------- -------- ----------------------------------
  **Parameter**    **UL**   **Notes**
  α, attenuation   0.4      Represents implementation losses

  SINRMAX, dB      22       Based on 64QAM 0.93 (UL)
  ---------------- -------- ----------------------------------

B.9 Antenna configuration
=========================

B.9.1 Base station
------------------

Assumptions captured in page 8 - 11 of \[R4-168794\] are assumed as BS
antenna configurations. For UMa and UMi base stations, we keep this same
antenna model.

B.9.2 CPE
---------

For CPE, we consider the following:

\- Baseline: (NV,NH) = (4, 8).

\- (d~V~,d~H~) = (0.5, 0.5)λ.

\- An additional 3dB gain is added to the total beamforming gain to
account for the two polarization directions.

\- 5dBi element gain, 90 degree HPBW in Azimuth and zenith, Am=25dB,
SLAv=25dB

ACIR range: 5 \~ 45dB, with 5dB as step. Note that: we do not have
simulation per 1dB step.

C.1.3 Cell layout
-----------------

Base stations with 3 sectors per site are placed on a hexagonal grid
with distance of 3\*R, where R is the cell radius (see Figure C.1.3-1),
with wrap around. The number of sites shall be equal to or higher than
19. Uncoordinated macro cellular deployment is assumed, where
interfering UE may be at cell edge of the serving base station but close
to the victim base station (hence transmitting with highest power and
causing highest interference).

Simulations should assume the worst case of 100 % HPUEs in the scenarios
with HPUEs.

C.1.5 Simulation procedure
--------------------------

For the co-existence study, the following procedure shall be performed:

> 1\) Run the Band 41 UL to UL coexistence study, assuming parameters of
> both systems are according Table C.1.4-1. Power control parameters in
> Table C.1.2-1 are used. This corresponds to the coexistence of two
> commercial networks operating in adjacent channel and with similar
> deployment parameters. This is used as the reference. Band 41 victim
> system performance degradation results in this scenario are used as
> the baseline. Provide a CDF plot of UE transmit power.
>
> 2\) Run the Band 41 UL to UL coexistence study, assuming +29 dBm power
> class UE is deployed in Band 41 interfering system only, and obtain
> the victim system performance degradation results. The simulation
> parameters in Tables C.1.4-1 and C.1.4-2 are used for the victim and
> interfering system, respectively. And the power control parameters in
> Tables C.1.2-1 and C.1.2-2 are used for the victim and interfering
> system, respectively. Provide a CDF plot of UE transmit power.
>
> 3\) Compare the Band 41 victim system performance degradation
> obtaining in steps 1) and 2), choose the 29 dBm UE ACLR value so that
> the victim system performance degradation due to 29 dBm UE in 2) is
> the same as 1).

C.2 Simulation results

The summary of the ACLR simulation results is shown in the Table C.2.1-1
below.

The simulation results have shown that when the UL power control
parameters are adjusted according to the UE maximum output power, the
ACLR of the 29 dBm UE need to be improved (\~1 dB) so that the victim
system performance degradation due to 29 dBm interfering UE is the same
as that due to 23 dBm interfering UE. Therefore, a value of 31 dB for
ACLR is needed for 29 dBm UE.

The simulation results have shown that the 99.99%-tile received signal
power in all simulated cases, except with the more aggressive Set 1 for
0.75 km inter-site distance, are lower than the current -43 dBm in-band
blocking requirements specified in RAN4 specifications for wide-area BS.
Although the 99.99%-tile received signal power with the more aggressive
Set 1 for 0.75 km inter-site distance with 20 MHz channel bandwidth is
slightly (\< 0.7 dB) higher than -43 dBm, this should not be an issue
for typical BS implementation with reasonable margin over the standards
requirements. Therefore, the current BS in-band blocking requirements
can also be applied for the 29 dBm UE case, and there is no need to
specify new BS in-band blocking requirements.

C.3 Conclusions

The simulation results have shown that when the UL power control
parameters are adjusted according to the UE maximum output power, the
ACLR of the 29 dBm UE need to be improved (\~1 dB) so that the victim
system performance degradation due to 29 dBm interfering UE is the same
as that due to 23 dBm interfering UE. Therefore, a value of 31 dB for
ACLR is needed for 29 dBm UE.

Moreover, the simulation results have shown that the current BS in-band
blocking requirements can also be applied for the 29 dBm UE case when
the UL power control parameters are adjusted according to the UE maximum
output power, and there is no need to specify new BS in-band blocking
requirements.
