4 General
=========

4.1 Relationship with other core specifications
-----------------------------------------------

The present document is a single-RAT specification for an IAB-DU and
IAB-MT, covering RF characteristics and minimum performance requirements
and RRM requirements for the IAB-MT. Conducted and radiated core
requirements are defined for the IAB node architectures and IAB node
types defined in subclause 4.3.

The applicability of each requirement is described in clause 4.6.

4.2 Relationship between minimum requirements and test requirements
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Conformance to the present specification is demonstrated by fulfilling
the test requirements specified in the conformance specification TS
38.176-1 \[25\] and TS 38.176-2 \[26\].

The minimum requirements given in this specification make no allowance
for measurement uncertainty. The test specifications TS 38.176-1 \[25\]
and TS 38.176-2 \[26\] define test tolerances. These test tolerances are
individually calculated for each test. The test tolerances are used to
relax the minimum requirements in this specification to create test
requirements. For some requirements, including regulatory requirements,
the test tolerance is set to zero.

The measurement results returned by the test system are compared -
without any modification - against the test requirements as defined by
the shared risk principle.

The shared risk principle is defined in recommendation ITU‑R M.1545
\[18\].

4.3 Conducted and radiated requirement reference points
-------------------------------------------------------

### 4.3.2 IAB type 1-H

For *IAB type 1-H*, the requirements are defined for two points of
reference, signified by radiated requirements and conducted
requirements.

Figure 4.3.2-1: Radiated and conducted reference points for *IAB type
1-H*

Radiated characteristics are defined over the air (OTA), where the
*operating band* specific radiated interface is referred to as the
*Radiated Interface Boundary* (RIB). Radiated requirements are also
referred to as OTA requirements. The (spatial) characteristics in which
the OTA requirements apply are detailed for each requirement.

Conducted characteristics are defined at individual or groups of *TAB
connectors* at the *transceiver array boundary*, which is the conducted
interface between the transceiver unit array and the composite antenna.

The transceiver unit array is part of the composite transceiver
functionality generating modulated transmit signal structures and
performing receiver combining and demodulation.

The transceiver unit array contains an implementation specific number of
transmitter units and an implementation specific number of receiver
units. Transmitter units and receiver units may be combined into
transceiver units. The transmitter/receiver units have the ability to
transmit/receive parallel independent modulated symbol streams.

The composite antenna contains a radio distribution network (RDN) and an
antenna array. The RDN is a linear passive network which distributes the
RF power generated by the transceiver unit array to the antenna array,
and/or distributes the radio signals collected by the antenna array to
the transceiver unit array, in an implementation specific way.

How a conducted requirement is applied to the *transceiver array
boundary* is detailed in the respective requirement subclause.

### 4.3.3 IAB type 1-O and IAB type 2-O

For *IAB type 1-O* and *IAB type 2-O*, the radiated characteristics are
defined over the air (OTA), where the *operating band* specific radiated
interface is referred to as the *Radiated Interface Boundary* (RIB).
Radiated requirements are also referred to as OTA requirements. The
(spatial) characteristics in which the OTA requirements apply are
detailed for each requirement.

Figure 4.3.3-1: Radiated reference points for *IAB type 1-O* and *IAB
type 2-O*

For an *IAB-DU type 1-O* the transceiver unit array must contain at
least 8 transmitter units and at least 8 receiver units. Transmitter
units and receiver units may be combined into transceiver units. The
transmitter/receiver units have the ability to transmit/receive parallel
independent modulated symbol streams.

4.4 IAB classes
---------------

### 4.4.1 IAB-DU classes

The requirements in this specification apply to Wide Area IAB-DU, Medium
Range IAB-DU and Local Area IAB-DU unless otherwise stated. The
associated deployment scenarios for each class are exactly the same for
IAB-DU with and without connectors.

For IAB *type 1-O* and 2-O, IAB-DU classes are defined as indicated
below:

\- Wide Area IAB-DU are characterised by requirements derived from Macro
Cell scenarios with a BS to UE minimum distance along the ground equal
to 35 m.

\- Medium Range IAB-DU are characterised by requirements derived from
Micro Cell scenarios with a BS to UE minimum distance along the ground
equal to 5 m.

\- Local Area IAB-DU are characterised by requirements derived from Pico
Cell scenarios with a BS to UE minimum distance along the ground equal
to 2 m.

For *IAB type* 1-H, IAB-DU classes are defined as indicated below:

\- Wide Area IAB-DU are characterised by requirements derived from Macro
Cell scenarios with a BS to UE minimum coupling loss equal to 70 dB.

\- Medium Range IAB-DU are characterised by requirements derived from
Micro Cell scenarios with a BS to UE minimum coupling loss equals to 53
dB.

\- Local Area IAB-DU are characterised by requirements derived from Pico
Cell scenarios with a BS to UE minimum coupling loss equal to 45 dB.

### 4.4.2 IAB-MT classes

*The requirements in this specification apply to Wide Area IAB-MT and
Local Area IAB-MT classes unless otherwise stated.*

*For IAB type 1-H, 1-O, and 2-O, IAB-MT classes are defined as indicated
below:*

\- Wide Area IAB-MT are characterised by requirements derived from Macro
Cell and/or Micro Cell scenarios.

\- Local Area IAB-MT are characterised by requirements derived from Pico
Cell and /or Micro Cell scenarios.

4.5 Regional requirements
-------------------------

Some requirements in the present document may only apply in certain
regions either as optional requirements, or as mandatory requirements
set by local and regional regulation. It is normally not stated in the
3GPP specifications under what exact circumstances the regional
requirements apply, since this is defined by local or regional
regulation.

4.7 Applicability of RRM requirements in this specification
-----------------------------------------------------------

### 4.7.1 Applicability of signalling characteristics related RRM requirements

The RRM requirements on the signalling characteristics for IAB MTs
specified in section 12.3 shall apply only for the local area IAB class
defined in section 4.4.

4.7.2 Applicability of RRM requirements in non-DRX

All the RRM requirements for IAB MT specified in section 12 shall apply
when no DRX is used. The IAB-MT shall assume that no DRX is used
provided the following conditions are met:

\- DRX parameters are not configured or

\- DRX parameters are configured and

\- drx-InactivityTimer is running or

\- drx-RetransmissionTimerDL is running or

\- drx-RetransmissionTimerUL is running or

\- ra-ContentionResolutionTimer is running or

\- a Scheduling Request sent on PUCCH is pending or

\- a PDCCH indicating a new transmission addressed to the C-RNTI of the
MAC entity has not been received after successful reception of a Random
Access Response for the preamble not selected by the MAC entity

4.8 Requirements for contiguous and non-contiguous spectrum
-----------------------------------------------------------

A spectrum allocation where an IAB-DU or IAB-MT operates can either be
contiguous or non-contiguous. Unless otherwise stated, the requirements
in the present specification apply for IAB-DU and IAB-MT configured for
both *contiguous spectrum* operation and *non-contiguous spectrum*
operation.

For IAB-DU or IAB-MT operation in *non-contiguous spectrum*, some
requirements apply both at the *IAB-DU RF Bandwidth edges* or *IAB-MT RF
Bandwidth edges*, and inside the *sub-block gaps*. For each such
requirement, it is stated how the limits apply relative to the *IAB-DU
RF Bandwidth edges* and *IAB-MT RF Bandwidth edges* and the *sub-block*
edges respectively.

4.9 Requirements for IAB-DU and IAB-MT capable of multi-band operation
----------------------------------------------------------------------

For *multi-band connector* or *multi-band* *RIB*, the RF requirements in
clause 6, 7, 9 and 10 apply separately to each supported *operating
band* unless otherwise stated. For some requirements, it is explicitly
stated that specific additions or exclusions to the requirement apply at
*multi-band connector(s)*, and *multi-band RIB(s)* as detailed in the
requirement clause. For *IAB-DU or IAB-MT* capable of multi-band
operation, various structures in terms of combinations of different
transmitter and receiver implementations (multi-band or single band)
with mapping of transceivers to one or more *TAB connectors* for
*IAB-DU* or *IAB-MT type 1-H* in different ways are possible. For
*multi-band connector(s)* the exclusions or provisions for multi-band
apply. For *single-band connector(s)*, the following applies:

\- Single-band transmitter spurious emissions, *operating band* unwanted
emissions, ACLR, transmitter intermodulation and receiver spurious
emissions requirements apply to this *connector* that is mapped to
single-band.

\- If the IAB-DU or IAB-MT is configured for single-band operation,
single-band requirements shall apply to this *connector* configured for
single-band operation and no exclusions or provisions for multi-band
capable *IAB-DU* or *IAB-MT* are applicable. Single-band requirements
are tested separately at the *connector* configured for single-band
operation, with all other *antenna connectors* terminated.

A *IAB-DU* or *IAB-MT type 1-H* may be capable of supporting operation
in multiple *operating bands* with one of the following implementations
of *TAB connectors* in the *transceiver array boundary*:

\- All *TAB connectors* are *single-band connectors*.

\- Different sets of *single-band connectors* support different
*operating bands*, but each *TAB connector* supports only operation in
one single *operating band*.

\- Sets of *single-band connectors* support operation in multiple
*operating bands* with some *single-band connectors* supporting more
than one *operating band*.

\- All *TAB connectors* are multi-band *connectors*.

\- A combination of single-band sets and multi-band sets of *TAB
connectors* provides support of the type *IAB-DU type 1-H* capability of
operation in multiple *operating bands*.

Unless otherwise stated all requirements specified for an *operating
band* apply only to the set of *TAB connectors* supporting that
*operating band*.

In the case of an *operating band* being supported only by *single-band
connectors* in a *TAB connector TX min cell group* or a *TAB connector
RX min cell group*, *single-band requirements* apply to that set of *TAB
connectors*.

In the case of an *operating band* being supported only by *multi-band
connector*s supporting the same *operating band* combination in a *TAB
connector TX min cell group* or a *TAB connector RX min cell group*,
*multi-band requirements* apply to that set of *TAB connectors*.

The case of an *operating band* being supported by both *multi-band
connectors* and *single-band connectors* in a *TAB connector TX min cell
group* or a *TAB connector RX min cell group* is not covered by the
present release of this specification.

The case of an *operating band* being supported by *multi-band
connectors* which are not all supporting the same *operating band*
combination in a *TAB connector TX min cell group* or a *TAB connector
RX min cell group* is not covered by the present release of this
specification.

*IAB-DU* or *IAB-MT type 1-O* may be capable of supporting operation in
multiple *operating bands* with one of the following implementations at
the *radiated interface boundary*:

\- All RIBs are *single-band RIBs*.

\- All RIBs are *multi-band* *RIBs*.

\- A combination of single-band *RIBs* and *multi-band RIBs* provides
support of the *IAB-DU* or *IAB-MT type 1-O* capability of operation in
multiple *operating bands*.

For *multi-band connectors* and *multi-band RIBs* supporting the bands
for TDD, the RF requirements in the present specification assume no
simultaneous uplink and downlink occur between the bands.

4.10 OTA co-location with other base stations
---------------------------------------------

Co-location requirements are requirements which are based on assuming
the *IAB-DU* or *IAB-MT type 1-O* is co-located with another BS or IAB
of the same base station class, they ensure that both co-located systems
can operate with minimal degradation to each other.

Unwanted emission and out of band blocking co-location requirements are
optional requirements based on declaration. TX OFF and TX IMD are
mandatory requirements and have the form of a co-location requirement as
it represents the worst-case scenario of all the interference cases.

NOTE: Due to the low level of the unwanted emissions for the spurious
emissions and TX OFF level co-location is the most suitable method to
show conformance.

The *co-location reference antenna* shall be a single column passive
antenna which has the same vertical radiating dimension (h), frequency
range, polarization, as the composite antenna of the *IAB-DU* or *IAB-MT
type 1-O* and nominal 65° horizontal half-power beamwidth (suitable for
3-sector deployment) and is placed at a distance *d* from the edge of
the *IAB-DU* or *IAB-MT type 1-O*, as shown in figure 4.10-1.

height="4.061111111111111in"}

Figure 4.10-1: Illustration of *IAB-DU* and *IAB-MT type 1-O* enclosure
and co-location reference antenna

Edge-to-edge separation *d* between the *IAB-DU* or *IAB-MT type 1-O*
and the *co-location reference antenna* shall be set to 0.1 m.

The *IAB-DU* or *IAB-MT type 1-O* and the *co-location reference
antenna* shall be aligned in a common plane perpendicular to the
mechanical bore-sight direction, as shown in figure 4.10-1.

The *co-location reference antenna* and the *IAB-DU* or *IAB-MT type
1-O* can have different width.

The vertical radiating regions of the *co-location reference antenna*
and the *IAB-DU* or *IAB-MT type 1-O* composite antenna shall be
aligned.

For co-location requirements where the frequency range of the signal at
the *co-location reference antenna* is different from the *IAB-DU* or
*IAB-MT type 1-O*, a *co-location reference antenna* suitable for the
frequency stated in the requirement is assumed.

OTA co-location requirements are based on the power at the conducted
interface of a *co-location reference antenna*, depending on the
requirement this interface is either an input or an output. For *IAB-DU*
or *IAB-MT type 1-O* with dual polarization *the co-location reference
antenna* has two conducted interfaces each representing one
polarization.

5 Operating bands and channel arrangement
=========================================

5.1 General
-----------

The channel arrangements presented in this clause are based on the
*operating bands* and *IAB-DU or IAB-MT channel bandwidths* defined in
the present release of specifications.

5.3 Channel bandwidth
---------------------

### 5.3.1 General

The IAB-DU channel bandwidth supports a single NR RF carrier in the
uplink or downlink at the IAB node. Different UE or IAB-MT channel
bandwidths may be supported within the same spectrum for transmitting to
and receiving from UEs or IAB-MT connected to the IAB-DU. The placement
of the UE or IAB-MT channel bandwidth is flexible but can only be
completely within the IAB-DU channel bandwidth. The IAB-DU shall be able
to transmit to and/or receive from one or more UE or IAB-MT Bandwidth
parts that are smaller than or equal to the number of carrier resource
blocks on the RF carrier, in any part of the carrier resource blocks.

The IAB-MT channel bandwidth supports a single NR RF carrier in the
uplink or downlink at the IAB-MT. From a BS or IAB-DU perspective,
different IAB-MT channel bandwidths may be supported within the same
spectrum for transmitting to and receiving from UEs or IAB-MT connected
to the IAB-DU. Transmission of multiple carriers to the same IAB-MT (CA)
or multiple carriers to different UEs or IAB-MT within the IAB-DU
channel bandwidth can be supported.

From a IAB-MT perspective, the IAB-MT is configured with one or more BWP
/ carriers, each with its own IAB-MT channel bandwidth. The IAB-MT does
not need to be aware of the BS or IAB-DU channel bandwidth or how the BS
or IAB-DU allocates bandwidth to different UEs or IAB-MT.

The placement of the IAB-MT channel bandwidth for each IAB-MT carrier is
flexible but can only be completely within the IAB-donor or IAB-DU
channel bandwidth.

The relationship between the IAB-DU or IAB-MT channel bandwidth, the
guardband and the transmission bandwidth configuration is shown in
Figure 5.3.1-1.

6 Conducted transmitter characteristics
=======================================

6.1 General
-----------

Unless otherwise stated, the conducted transmitter characteristics are
specified at the *TAB connector* for *IAB-DU and IAB-MT type 1-H*, with
a full complement of transceiver units for the configuration in normal
operating conditions.

*For IAB-DU and IAB-MT* *type 1-H the manufacturer shall declare the
minimum number of supported geographical cells (i.e. geographical areas
c*overed by beams*). The declaration is done separately for IAB-DU and
IAB-MT. The minimum number of supported geographical cells (N~cells~)
relates to the setting with the minimum amount of cell splitting
supported with transmission on all TAB connectors supporting the
operating band,* or with minimum amount of transmitted beams*.*

*For IAB-DU and IAB-MT* *type 1-H manufacturer shall also declare TAB
connector TX min cell groups. The declaration is done separately for
IAB-DU and IAB-MT.* Every *TAB connector* of the *IAB-DU type 1-H* and
IAB-MT type 1-H supporting transmission in an *operating band* shall map
to one *TAB connector* *TX min cell group* supporting the same
*operating band*, where *mapping of TAB connectors to cells/beams is
implementation dependent.*

*The number of active transmitter units that are considered when
calculating the conducted TX emissions limits (N~TXU,counted~) for
IAB-DU and IAB-MT type 1-H is calculated as follows:*

N~TXU,counted~ = *min(N~TXU,active~ , 8×N~cells~)*

N~TXU,countedpercell~ is used for scaling of *basic limits* and is
derived as N~TXU,countedpercell~ = *N~TXU,counted~ / N~cells~*

NOTE: N~TXU,active~ depends on the actual number of *active transmitter
unit*s and is independent to the declaration of N~cells~.

The RE power control dynamic range is the difference between the power
of an RE and the average RE power for a IAB-DU at maximum output power
(P~max,c,TABC~) for a specified reference condition.

For *IAB-DU type 1-H* this requirement shall apply at each *TAB
connector* supporting transmission in the *operating band*.

##### 6.3.1.2.2 Minimum requirement for *IAB-DU type 1-H*

The RE power control dynamic range is specified the same as the
conducted RE power control dynamic range requirement for BS *type 1-H*
in TS 38.104 \[2\], subclause 6.3.2.2.

#### 6.3.1.3 Total power dynamic range

##### 6.3.1.3.1 General

maximum and the minimum transmit power of an OFDM symbol for a specified
reference condition.

For *IAB-DU type 1-H* this requirement shall apply at each *TAB

a BS when transmitting on all RBs at maximum output power. The lower
limit of the total power dynamic range is the average power for single
RB transmission. The OFDM symbol shall carry PDSCH and not contain RS or
SSB.

##### 6.3.1.3.2 Minimum requirement for IAB-DU *type 1-H*

The total power dynamic range is specified the same as the total power
dynamic range requirement for BS *type 1-H* in TS 38.104 \[2\],

### 6.3.3 Power control

#### 6.3.3.1 Relative power tolerance for local area IAB-MT type 1-H

The relative power tolerance is the ability of the transmitter to set
its output power in a target sub-frame (1 ms) relatively to the power of
the most recently transmitted reference sub-frame (1 ms) if the
transmission gap between these sub-frames is less than or equal to 20
ms.

The minimum requirements specified for each *TAB-connector* in Table
6.3.3.1-1 apply only when the output power is within the limits set by
declared maximum output power and specified dynamic range.

2 exceptions are allowed for each of two test patterns. The test
patterns are a monotonically increasing power sweep and a monotonically
decreasing power sweep. For those exceptions, the power tolerance limit
is a maximum of \[± 6.0 dB\] in Table 6.3.3.1-1.

#### 6.3.3.2 Aggregate power tolerance for local area IAB-MT type 1-H

The aggregate power control tolerance is the ability of the transmitter
to maintain its power in a sub-frame (1 ms) during non-contiguous
transmissions within \[21 ms\] in response to 0 dB commands with respect
to the first transmission and all other power control parameters as
specified in 3GPP TS 38.213 \[10\] kept constant.

6.4 Transmit ON/OFF power
-------------------------

### 6.4.1 Transmitter OFF power

#### 6.4.1.1 General

filtered with a square filter of bandwidth equal to the *transmission
bandwidth configuration* of the IAB (BW~Config~) centred on the assigned
channel frequency during the *transmitter OFF period*. N = SCS/15, where
SCS is Sub Carrier Spacing in kHz.

For IAB-DUand IAB-MT, for *multi-band connectors* and for *single band
connectors* supporting transmission in multiple *operating bands*, the
requirement is only applicable during the *transmitter OFF period* in
all supported *operating bands*.

For IAB supporting intra-band contiguous CA, the transmitter OFF power
is defined as the mean power measured over 70/N us filtered with a
square filter of bandwidth equal to the *Aggregated IAB-DU Channel
Bandwidth* or *IAB-MT Channel Bandwidth* **BW~Channel\_CA~ centred on
(F~edge,high~+F~edge,low~)/2 during the *transmitter OFF period*.** N =
SCS/15, where SCS is the smallest supported Sub Carrier Spacing in kHz
in the *Aggregated IAB-DU (IAB-MT) Channel Bandwidth*.

### 6.4.2 Transmitter transient period

#### 6.4.2.1 General

Transmitter transient period requirements apply to TDD operation of
IAB-DU and TDD operation of IAB-MT.

The transmitter transient period is the time period during which the
transmitter is changing from the transmitter OFF period to the
transmitter ON period or vice versa. The transmitter transient period is
illustrated in figure 6.4.2.1-1 for IAB-DU and IAB-MT.

#### 6.5.1.1 IAB-DU frequency error

The requirements in clause 6.5.1 for BS type 1-H in TS 38.104 \[2\]
apply to IAB-DU type 1-H.

#### 6.5.1.2 IAB-MT frequency error

The IAB-MT basic measurement interval of modulated carrier frequency is
1 UL slot. The mean value of basic measurements of IAB-MT modulated
carrier frequency shall be accurate to within ± 0.1 PPM observed over a

The requirements in clause 6.5.2 for BS type 1-H in TS 38.104 \[2\]
apply to IAB-DU type 1-H.

#### 6.5.2.2 IAB-MT modulation quality

##### 6.5.2.2.1 General

Modulation quality is defined by the difference between the measured
carrier signal and an ideal signal. Modulation quality can e.g. be
expressed as Error Vector Magnitude (EVM). The Error Vector Magnitude is
a measure of the difference between the ideal symbols and the measured
symbols after the equalization. This difference is called the error
vector. Details about how the EVM is determined are specified in Annex
D.

For IAB-MT type 1-H this requirement shall be applied at each TAB
connector supporting transmission in the *operating band*.

##### 6.5.2.2.2 Minimum requirements for IAB-MT type 1-H

For *IAB-MT type 1-H*, the EVM levels of each NR carrier for different
modulation schemes outlined in table 6.5.2.2.2-1 shall be met using the
frame structure described in clause 6.5.2.2.3.

Table 6.5.2.2.2-1: Requirements for Error Vector Magnitude

blocks and uplink subframes for IAB-MT. Different modulation schemes
listed in Table 6.5.2.2.2-1 shall be considered for rank 1.

For NR, for all bandwidths, the EVM measurement shall be performed for
each NR carrier over all allocated resource blocks and uplink subframes
within 10 ms measurement periods. The boundaries of the EVM measurement
periods need not be aligned with radio frame boundaries.

### 6.5.3 Time alignment error

#### 6.5.3.1 IAB-DU time alignment error

The requirements in clause 6.5.3 for BS type 1-H in TS 38.104 \[2\]
apply to IAB-DU type 1-H.

6.6 Unwanted emissions
----------------------

### 6.6.1 General

Unwanted emissions consist of out-of-band emissions and spurious
emissions according to ITU definitions \[16\]. In ITU terminology, out
of band emissions are unwanted emissions immediately outside the
*channel bandwidth* resulting from the modulation process and
non-linearity in the transmitter but excluding spurious emissions.
Spurious emissions are emissions which are caused by unwanted
transmitter effects such as harmonics emission, parasitic emission,
intermodulation products and frequency conversion products, but exclude
out of band emissions.

The out-of-band emissions requirement for the IAB-DU and IAB-MT
transmitter is specified both in terms of Adjacent Channel Leakage power
Ratio (ACLR) and *operating band* unwanted emissions (OBUE).

The maximum offset of the *operating band* unwanted emissions mask from
the *operating band* edge is Δf~OBUE~. The Operating band unwanted
emissions define all unwanted emissions in each supported downlink
*operating band* of IAB-DU and uplink *operating band* of IAB-MT, plus
the frequency ranges Δf~OBUE~ above and Δf~OBUE~ below each band.
Unwanted emissions outside of this frequency range are limited by a
spurious emissions requirement.

The values of Δf~OBUE~ are defined in tables 6.6.1-1 and 6.6.1-2 for the
NR *operating bands*.

Table 6.6.1-1: Maximum offset of OBUE outside the downlink *operating
band of IAB-DU*

  IAB-DU type       *Operating band* characteristics              Δf~OBUE~ (MHz)
  ----------------- --------------------------------------------- ----------------
  IAB-DU type 1-H   F~DL,high~ -- F~DL,low~ \< 100 MHz            10
                    100 MHz ≤ F~DL,high~ -- F~DL,low~ ≤ 900 MHz   40

Table 6.6.1-2: Maximum offset of OBUE outside the uplink *operating band
of IAB-MT*

  IAB-MT type       *Operating band* characteristics              Δf~OBUE~ (MHz)
  ----------------- --------------------------------------------- ----------------
  IAB-MT type 1-H   F~UL,high~ -- F~UL,low~ \< 100 MHz            10
                    100 MHz ≤ F~UL,high~ -- F~UL,low~ ≤ 900 MHz   40

For *IAB-DU type 1-H and IAB-MT type 1-H* the unwanted emission
requirements are applied per the *TAB connector TX min cell groups* for
all the supported configurations. The *basic limits* and corresponding
emissions scaling are defined in each relevant clause.

There is in addition a requirement for occupied bandwidth.

### 6.6.2 Occupied bandwidth

#### 6.6.2.1 General

The occupied bandwidth is the width of a frequency band such that, below
the lower and above the upper frequency limits, the mean powers emitted
are each equal to a specified percentage β/2 of the total mean
transmitted power. See also Recommendation ITU-R SM.328 \[19\].

The value of β/2 shall be taken as 0.5%.

The occupied bandwidth requirement shall apply during the *transmitter
ON period* for a single transmitted carrier. The minimum requirement
below may be applied regionally. There may also be regional requirements
to declare the occupied bandwidth according to the definition in the
present clause.

For *IAB-DU type 1-H* and *IAB-MT type 1-H* this requirement shall be
applied at each *TAB connector* supporting transmission in the
*operating band.*

#### 6.6.2.2 Minimum requirement for *IAB-DU type 1-H*

The occupied bandwidth for each NR carrier shall be less than the
*IAB-DU channel bandwidth*. For intra-band contiguous CA, t**he occupied
bandwidth shall be less than or equal the *Aggregated IAB-DU Channel
Bandwidth*.**

#### 6.6.2.3 Minimum requirement for *IAB-MT type 1-H*

The occupied bandwidth for each NR carrier shall be less than the
*IAB-MT channel bandwidth*. For intra-band contiguous CA, t**he occupied
bandwidth shall be less than or equal the *Aggregated IAB-MT Channel
Bandwidth*.**

### 6.6.3 Adjacent Channel Leakage Power Ratio

#### 6.6.3.1 General

Adjacent Channel Leakage power Ratio (ACLR) is the ratio of the filtered
mean power centred on the assigned channel frequency to the filtered
mean power centred on an adjacent channel frequency.

The requirements shall apply outside the *IAB-DU RF Bandwidth, IAB-MT RF
Bandwidth* or *Radio Bandwidth* whatever the type of transmitter
considered (single carrier or multi-carrier) and for all transmission
modes foreseen by the manufacturer's specification.

For an *IAB-Node* operating in *non-contiguous spectrum*, the ACLR
requirement in clause 6.6.3.2 shall apply in *sub-block gaps* for the
frequency ranges defined in table 6.6.3.2-3, while the CACLR requirement
in clause 6.6.3.2 shall apply in *sub-block gaps* for the frequency
ranges defined in table 6.6.3.2-4.

For a *multi-band connector*, the ACLR requirement in clause 6.6.3.2
shall apply in *Inter RF Bandwidth gaps* for the frequency ranges
defined in table 6.6.3.2-3, while the CACLR requirement in clause
6.6.3.2 shall apply in *Inter RF Bandwidth gaps* for the frequency
ranges defined in table 6.6.3.2-4.

The requirement shall apply during the *transmitter ON period*.

#### 6.6.3.2 Limits and *Basic limits*

The ACLR is defined with a square filter of bandwidth equal to the
transmission bandwidth configuration of the transmitted signal
(BW~Config~) centred on the assigned channel frequency and a filter
centred on the adjacent channel frequency according to the tables below.

The ACLR shall be higher than the value specified in table 6.6.3.2‑1.

The Cumulative Adjacent Channel Leakage power Ratio (CACLR) in a
*sub-block gap* or the *Inter RF Bandwidth gap* is the ratio of:

a\) the sum of the filtered mean power centred on the assigned channel
frequencies for the two carriers adjacent to each side of the *sub-block
gap* or the *Inter RF Bandwidth gap*, and

b\) the filtered mean power centred on a frequency channel adjacent to
one of the respective *sub-block* edges, *IAB-MT RF Bandwidth edges or*
*IAB-DU RF Bandwidth edges*.

The assumed filter for the adjacent channel frequency is defined in
table 6.6.3.2-4 and the filters on the assigned channels are defined in
table 6.6.3.2-6.

For operation in *non-contiguous spectrum* or multiple bands, the CACLR
for NR carriers located on either side of the *sub-block gap* or the
*Inter RF Bandwidth gap* shall be higher than the value specified in
table 6.6.3.2-4.

#### 6.6.3.3 Minimum requirement for *IAB-DU type 1-H and IAB-MT type 1-H*

The ACLR (CACLR) absolute *basic limits* in table 6.6.3.2-2 + X,
6.6.3.2-5 + X (where X = 10log~10~(N~TXU,countedpercell~)) or the ACLR
(CACLR) *limits* in table 6.6.3.2-1, 6.6.3.2-3 or 6.6.3.2-4, whichever
is less stringent, shall apply for each *TAB connector TX min cell
group*.

NOTE: Conformance to the *IAB-DU type 1-H and IAB-MT type 1-H* ACLR
requirements can be demonstrated by meeting at least one of the
following criteria as determined by the manufacturer:

1\) The ratio of the sum of the filtered mean power measured on each
*TAB connector* in the *TAB connector TX min cell group* at the assigned
channel frequency to the sum of the filtered mean power measured on each
*TAB connector* in the *TAB connector TX min cell group* at the adjacent
channel frequency shall be greater than or equal to the ACLR *basic
limit*. This shall apply for each *TAB connector TX min cell group*.

Or

2\) The ratio of the filtered mean power at the *TAB connector* centred
on the assigned channel frequency to the filtered mean power at this
*TAB connector* centred on the adjacent channel frequency shall be
greater than or equal to the ACLR *basic limit* for every *TAB
connector* in the *TAB connector TX min cell group*, for each *TAB
connector TX min cell group*.

In case the ACLR (CACLR) absolute *basic limit* of *IAB-DU type 1-H* or
*IAB-MT type 1-H* is applied, the conformance can be demonstrated by
meeting at least one of the following criteria as determined by the
manufacturer:

1\) The sum of the filtered mean power measured on each *TAB connector*
in the *TAB connector TX min cell group* at the adjacent channel
frequency shall be less than or equal to the ACLR (CACLR) absolute
ba*sic limit* + X. This shall apply to each *TAB* connector *TX min cell
group.*

Or

2\) The filtered mean power at each *TAB connector* centred on the
adjacent channel frequency shall be less than or equal to the ACLR
(CACLR) absolute *basic limit* scaled by X -10log~10~(*n*) for every
*TAB connector* in the *TAB connector TX min cell group*, for each *TAB
connector TX min cell group*, where *n* is the number of *TAB
connectors* in the *TAB connector TX min cell group.*

### 6.6.4 Operating band unwanted emissions

#### 6.6.4.1 General

Unless otherwise stated, the operating band unwanted emission (OBUE)
limits for IAB-DU in FR1 are defined from Δf~OBUE~ below the lowest
frequency of each supported downlink *operating band* up to Δf~OBUE~
above the highest frequency of each supported downlink *operating band*.
The values of Δf~OBUE~ are defined in table 6.6.1‑1 for the NR
*operating bands*.

Unless otherwise stated, the operating band unwanted emission (OBUE)
limits for IAB-MT in FR1 are defined from Δf~OBUE~ below the lowest
frequency of each supported uplink *operating band* up to Δf~OBUE~ above
the highest frequency of each supported uplink *operating band*. The
values of Δf~OBUE~ are defined in table 6.6.1‑2 for the NR *operating
bands*.

The requirements shall apply whatever the type of transmitter considered
and for all transmission modes foreseen by the manufacturer's
specification. In addition, for IAB-DU and IAB-MT operating in
*non-contiguous spectrum*, the requirements apply inside any *sub-block
gap*. In addition, for a IAB-MT or IAB-DU operating in multiple bands,
the requirements apply inside any *Inter RF Bandwidth gap*.

*Basic limits* are specified in the tables below, where:

\- ∆f is the separation between the *channel edge* frequency and the
nominal -3dB point of the measuring filter closest to the carrier
frequency.

\- f\_offset is the separation between the *channel edge* frequency and
the centre of the measuring filter.

\- f\_offset~max~ is the offset to the frequency Δf~OBUE~ outside the
downlink *operating band of IAB-DU and uplink operating band of IAB-MT*,
where Δf~OBUE~ is defined in tables 6.6.1-1 and 6.6.1-2.

\- ∆f~max~ is equal to f\_offset~max~ minus half of the bandwidth of the
measuring filter.

For a *multi-band connector* inside any *Inter RF Bandwidth gaps* with
W~gap~ \< 2\*Δf~OBUE~, a combined *basic* limit shall be applied which
is the cumulative sum of the *basic limit*s specified at the *IAB-DU and
IAB-MT RF Bandwidth edges* on each side of the *Inter RF Bandwidth gap*.
The *basic limit* for *IAB-DU and IAB-MT RF Bandwidth edge* is specified
in clauses 6.6.4.2.1 to 6.6.4.2.4 below, where in this case:

\- ∆f is the separation between the *IAB-DU or IAB-MT RF Bandwidth edge*
frequency and the nominal -3 dB point of the measuring filter closest to
the *IAB-DU or IAB-MT RF Bandwidth edge*.

\- f\_offset is the separation from the *IAB-DU or IAB-MT RF Bandwidth
edge* frequency to the centre of the measuring filter.

\- f\_offset~max~ is equal to the *Inter RF Bandwidth gap* minus half of
the bandwidth of the measuring filter.

\- ∆f~max~ is equal to f\_offset~max~ minus half of the bandwidth of the
measuring filter.

For a *multi-band connector of IAB-DU*, the operating band unwanted
emission limits apply also in a supported downlink *operating band*
without any carrier transmitted, in the case where there are carrier(s)
transmitted in another supported downlink *operating band*. In this
case, no cumulative *basic limit* is applied in the *inter-band gap*
between a supported downlink *operating band* with carrier(s)
transmitted and a supported downlink *operating band* without any
carrier transmitted and

\- In case the *inter-band gap* between a supported downlink *operating
band* with carrier(s) transmitted and a supported downlink *operating
band* without any carrier transmitted is less than 2\*Δf~OBUE~,
f\_offset~max~ shall be the offset to the frequency Δf~OBUE~ MHz outside
the outermost edges of the two supported downlink *operating bands* and
the operating band unwanted emission *basic limits* of the band where
there are carriers transmitted, as defined in the tables of the present
clause, shall apply across both downlink bands.

\- In other cases, the operating band unwanted emission *basic limits*
of the band where there are carriers transmitted, as defined in the
tables of the present clause for the largest frequency offset (∆f~max~),
shall apply from Δf~OBUE~ MHz below the lowest frequency, up to Δf~OBUE~
MHz above the highest frequency of the supported downlink *operating
band* without any carrier transmitted.

For a *multi-band connector of IAB-MT*, the operating band unwanted
emission limits apply also in a supported uplink *operating band*
without any carrier transmitted, in the case where there are carrier(s)
transmitted in another supported uplink *operating band*. In this case,
no cumulative *basic limit* is applied in the *inter-band gap* between a
supported uplink *operating band* with carrier(s) transmitted and a
supported uplink *operating band* without any carrier transmitted and

\- In case the inter-band gap between a supported uplink operating band
with carrier(s) transmitted and a supported uplink operating band
without any carrier transmitted is less than 2\* Δf~OBUE~, f\_offsetmax
shall be the offset to the frequency Δf~OBUE~ MHz outside the outermost
edges of the two supported uplink operating bands and the operating band
unwanted emission basic limits of the band where there are carriers
transmitted, as defined in the tables of the present clause, shall apply
across both uplink bands.

\- In other cases, the operating band unwanted emission basic limits of
the band where there are carriers transmitted, as defined in the tables
of the present clause for the largest frequency offset (∆fmax), shall
apply from Δf~OBUE~ MHz below the lowest frequency, up to Δf~OBUE~ MHz
above the highest frequency of the supported uplink operating band
without any carrier transmitted.

For a multicarrier *single-band connector* or a *single-band connector*
configured for intra-band contiguous or non-contiguous *carrier
aggregation* the definitions above apply to the lower edge of the
carrier transmitted at the *lowest carrier* frequency and the upper edge
of the carrier transmitted at the *highest carrier* frequency within a
specified frequency band.

In addition, inside any *sub-block gap* for a *single-band connector*
operating in *non-contiguous spectrum*, a combined *basic* limit shall
be applied which is the cumulative sum of the *basic limit*s specified
for the adjacent *sub-blocks* on each side of the *sub-block gap*. The
*basic limit* for each *sub-block* is specified in clauses 6.6.4.2.1 to
6.6.4.2.4 below, where in this case:

\- ∆f is the separation between the *sub-block* edge frequency and the
nominal -3 dB point of the measuring filter closest to the *sub-block*
edge.

\- f\_offset is the separation between the *sub-block* edge frequency
and the centre of the measuring filter.

\- f\_offset~max~ is equal to the *sub-block gap* bandwidth minus half
of the bandwidth of the measuring filter.

\- ∆f~max~ is equal to f\_offset~max~ minus half of the bandwidth of the

##### 6.6.4.2.5 *Basic limits* for additional requirements

###### 6.6.4.2.5.1 Limits in FCC Title 47

In addition to the requirements in clauses 6.6.4.2.1, 6.6.4.2.2,
6.6.4.2.3 and 6.6.4.2.4, the IAB-DU and IAB-MT may have to comply with
the applicable emission limits established by FCC Title 47 \[20\], when
deployed in regions where those limits are applied, and under the
conditions declared by the manufacturer.

#### 6.6.4.3 Minimum requirements for *IAB-DU type 1-H and IAB-MT type 1-H*

The operating band unwanted emissions requirements for *IAB-DU type 1-H*
and *IAB-MT type 1-H* are that for each *TAB connector TX min cell
group* and each applicable *basic limit* in clause 6.6.4.2, the power
summation emissions at the *TAB connectors* of the *TAB connector TX min
cell group* shall not exceed a limit specified as the *basic limit* + X,
where X = 10log~10~(N~TXU,countedpercell~).

NOTE: Conformance to the *IAB-DU type 1-H* and *IAB-MT type 1-H*
operating band unwanted emission requirement can be demonstrated by
meeting at least one of the following criteria as determined by the
manufacturer:

1\) The sum of the emissions power measured on each *TAB connector* in
the *TAB connector TX min cell group* shall be less than or equal to the
limit as defined in this clause for the respective frequency span.

Or

2\) The unwanted emissions power at each *TAB connector* shall be less
than or equal to the *type 1-H* limit as defined in this clause for the
respective frequency span, scaled by -10log~10~(n), where n is the
number of *TAB connectors* in the *TAB connector TX min cell group*.

### 6.6.5 Transmitter spurious emissions

#### 6.6.5.1 General

For IAB-DU, the transmitter spurious emission limits shall apply from
9 kHz to 12.75 GHz, excluding the frequency range from Δf~OBUE~ below
the lowest frequency of each supported downlink *operating band*, up to
Δf~OBUE~ above the highest frequency of each supported downlink
*operating band*, where the Δf~OBUE~ is defined in table 6.6.1-1. For
some *operating bands*, the upper limit is higher than 12.75 GHz in
order to comply with the 5^th^ harmonic limit of the downlink *operating
band*, as specified in ITU-R recommendation SM.329 \[16\].

For IAB-MT, the transmitter spurious emission limits shall apply from
9 kHz to 12.75 GHz, excluding the frequency range from Δf~OBUE~ below
the lowest frequency of each supported uplink *operating band*, up to
Δf~OBUE~ above the highest frequency of each supported uplink *operating
band*, where the Δf~OBUE~ is defined in table 6.6.1-2. For some
*operating bands*, the upper limit is higher than 12.75 GHz in order to
comply with the 5^th^ harmonic limit of the uplink *operating band*, as
specified in ITU-R recommendation SM.329 \[16\].

For a *multi-band connector*, for each supported *operating band*
together with Δf~OBUE~ around the band is excluded from the transmitter
spurious emissions requirement.

The requirements shall apply whatever the type of transmitter considered
(single carrier or multi-carrier). It applies for all transmission modes
foreseen by the manufacturer\'s specification.

Unless otherwise stated, all requirements are measured as mean power
(RMS).

#### 6.6.5.2 Basic limits

##### 6.6.5.2.1 General transmitter spurious emissions requirements

The *basic limits* of either table 6.6.5.2.1-1 (Category A limits) or
table 6.6.5.2.1-2 (Category B limits) shall apply. The application of
either Category A or Category B limits shall be the same as for
operating band unwanted emissions in clause 6.6.4.

##### 6.6.5.2.2 Additional spurious emissions requirements

These requirements may be applied for the protection of system operating
in other frequency ranges. The limits may apply as an optional
protection of such systems that are deployed in the same geographical
area as the IAB-Node, or they may be set by local or regional regulation
as a mandatory requirement for an NR *operating band*. It is in some
cases not stated in the present document whether a requirement is
mandatory or under what exact circumstances that a limit applies, since
this is set by local or regional regulation. An overview of regional
requirements in the present document is given in clause 4.5.

Some requirements may apply for the protection of specific equipment
(UE, MS and/or BS) or equipment operating in specific systems (GSM,
CDMA, UTRA, E-UTRA, NR, etc.) as listed below.

The spurious emission *basic limits* are provided in table 6.6.5.2.2-1
where requirements for co-existence with the system listed in the first
column apply for IAB-MT and IAB-DU. For a *multi-band connector*, the
exclusions and conditions in the Note column of table 6.6.5.2.2-1 apply
for each supported *operating band*.

NOTE 1: As defined in the scope for spurious emissions in this clause
the co-existence requirements in table 6.6.5.2.2-1 do not apply for the
Δf~OBUE~ frequency range immediately outside the downlink *operating
band* (see table 5.2-1). Emission limits for this excluded frequency
range may be covered by local or regional requirements.

NOTE 2: Table 6.6.5.2.2-1 assumes that two *operating bands*, where the
frequency ranges in table 5.2-1 would be overlapping, are not deployed
in the same geographical area. For such a case of operation with
overlapping frequency arrangements in the same geographical area,
special co-existence requirements may apply that are not covered by the
3GPP specifications.

##### 6.6.5.2.3 Co-location with base stations and IAB-Nodes

These requirements may be applied for the protection of other BS, IAB-DU
or IAB-MT receivers when GSM900, DCS1800, PCS1900, GSM850, CDMA850, UTRA
FDD, UTRA TDD, E-UTRA, NR BS, IAB-DU or IAB-MT are co-located with
IAB-MT and/or IAB-DU.

The requirements assume a 30 dB coupling loss between transmitter and
receiver and are based on co-location with same class.

The *basic limits* are in table 6.6.5.2.3-1 for an IAB-DU and IAB-MT.
Requirements for co-location with a system listed in the first column
apply, depending on the declared IAB-DU and IAB-MT class. For a
*multi-band connector*, the exclusions and conditions in the Note column
of table 6.6.5.2.3-1 shall apply for each supported *operating band*.

NOTE 1: As defined in the scope for spurious emissions in this clause,
the co-location requirements in table 6.6.5.2.3-1 do not apply for the
frequency range extending Δf~OBUE~ immediately outside the transmit
frequency range of a IAB-MT and IAB-DU. The current state-of-the-art
technology does not allow a single generic solution for co-location with
other system on adjacent frequencies for 30dB antenna to antenna minimum
coupling loss. However, there are certain site-engineering solutions
that can be used. These techniques are addressed in TR 25.942 \[4\].

NOTE 2: Table 6.6.5.2.3-1 assumes that two *operating bands*, where the
corresponding transmit and receive frequency ranges in table 5.2-1 would
be overlapping, are not deployed in the same geographical area. For such
a case of operation with overlapping frequency arrangements in the same
geographical area, special co-location requirements may apply that are
not covered by the 3GPP specifications.

#### 6.6.5.3 Minimum requirements for *IAB-DU and IAB-MT type 1-H*

The Tx spurious emissions requirements for *IAB-DU type 1-H* and *IAB-MT
type 1-H* are that for each *TAB connector TX min cell group* and each
applicable *basic limit* in clause 6.6.5.2, the power summation of
emissions at the *TAB connectors* of the *TAB connector TX min cell
group* shall not exceed a limit specified as the *basic limit* + X,
where X = 10log~10~(N~TXU,countedpercell~), unless stated differently in
regional regulation.

NOTE: Conformance to the *IAB-DU type 1-H and IAB-MT type 1-H* spurious
emission requirement can be demonstrated by meeting at least one of the
following criteria as determined by the manufacturer:

1\) The sum of the emissions power measured on each *TAB connector* in
the *TAB connector TX min cell group* shall be less than or equal to the
limit as defined in this clause for the respective frequency span.

Or

2\) The unwanted emissions power at each *TAB connector* shall be less
than or equal to the *type 1-H* limit as defined in this clause for the
respective frequency span, scaled by -10log~10~(n), where n is the
number of *TAB connectors* in the *TAB connector TX min cell group*.

6.7 Transmitter intermodulation
-------------------------------

### 6.7.1 General

The transmitter intermodulation requirement is a measure of the
capability of the transmitter unit to inhibit the generation of signals
in its non-linear elements caused by presence of the wanted signal and
an interfering signal reaching the transmitter unit via the antenna, RDN
and antenna array. The requirement shall apply during the *transmitter
ON period* and the *transmitter transient period*.

For *IAB type 1-H*, the transmitter intermodulation level is the power
of the intermodulation products when an interfering signal is injected
into the *TAB connector*.

For *IAB type 1-H*, there are two types of transmitter intermodulation
cases captured by the transmitter intermodulation requirement:

1\) Co-location transmitter intermodulation in which the interfering
signal is from a co-located base station or IAB.

2\) Intra-system transmitter intermodulation in which the interfering
signal is from other transmitter units within the *IAB type 1-H*.

For *IAB type 1-H*, the co-location transmitter intermodulation
requirement is considered sufficient if the interference signal for the
co-location requirement is higher than the declared interference signal
for intra-system transmitter intermodulation requirement.

### 6.7.2 Minimum requirements for *IAB-DU type 1-H and IAB-MT type 1-H*

#### 6.7.2.1 Co-location minimum requirements

The transmitter intermodulation level shall not exceed the unwanted
emission limits in clauses 7.6 in the presence of an NR interfering
signal according to table 6.7. 2.1-1

The requirement is applicable outside the *IAB RF Bandwidth edges*. The
interfering signal offset is defined relative to the *IAB RF Bandwidth*
*edges* or *Radio Bandwidth* edges.

For *TAB connectors* supporting operation in *non-contiguous spectrum*,
the requirement is also applicable inside a *sub-block gap* for
interfering signal offsets where the interfering signal falls completely
within the *sub-block gap*. The interfering signal offset is defined
relative to the *sub-block* edges.

For *multi-band connector*, the requirement shall apply relative to the
*IAB RF Bandwidth* *edges* of each *operating band*. In case the *inter
RF Bandwidth gap* is less than 3\*BW~Channel~ (where BW~Channel~ is the
minimal *IAB-DU channel bandwidth* or *IAB-MT channel bandwidth* of the
band), the requirement in the gap shall apply only for interfering
signal offsets where the interfering signal falls completely within the
*inter RF Bandwidth gap*.

7 Conducted receiver characteristics
====================================

7.1 General
-----------

Conducted receiver characteristics are specified at *TAB connector* for
*IAB type 1-H*, with full complement of transceivers for the
configuration in normal operating condition.

Unless otherwise stated, the following arrangements apply for conducted
receiver characteristics requirements in clause 7:

\- Requirements apply during the receive period.

\- Requirements shall be met for any transmitter setting.

\- Throughput requirements defined for the conducted receiver
characteristics do not assume HARQ retransmissions.

\- When IAB-DU or IAB-MT is configured to receive multiple carriers, all
the throughput requirements are applicable for each received carrier.

\- For ACS, blocking and intermodulation characteristics, the negative
offsets of the interfering signal apply relative to the lower *IAB RF
Bandwidth* edge or *sub-block* edge inside a *sub-block gap*, and the
positive offsets of the interfering signal apply relative to the upper
*IAB RF Bandwidth* edge or *sub-block* edge inside a *sub-block gap*.

NOTE 1: In normal operating condition the IAB-DU and IAB-MT in TDD
operation are configured to TX OFF power during *receive period*.

7.2 Reference sensitivity level
-------------------------------

### 7.2.1 IAB-DU reference sensitivity level 

#### 7.2.1.1 General

The reference sensitivity power level P~REFSENS~ is the minimum mean
power received at the *TAB connector* for *IAB-DU type 1-H* at which a
throughput requirement shall be met for a specified reference
measurement channel.

#### 7.2.1.2 Minimum requirements for *IAB-DU type 1-H*

The wide area IAB-DU reference sensitivity level is specified the same
as the wide area BS reference sensitivity level requirement for *BS type
1-H* in TS 38.104 \[2\], subclause 7.2.2, where references to *BS
channel bandwidth* apply to *IAB-DU channel bandwidth*.

The medium range IAB-DU reference sensitivity level is specified the
same as the medium range BS reference sensitivity level requirement for
*BS type 1-H* in TS 38.104 \[2\], subclause 7.2.2, where references to
*BS channel bandwidth* apply to *IAB-DU channel bandwidth*.

The local area IAB-DU reference sensitivity level is specified the same
as the local area BS reference sensitivity level requirement for *BS
type 1-H* in TS 38.104 \[2\], subclause 7.2.2, where references to *BS
channel bandwidth* apply to *IAB-DU channel bandwidth*.

Referenced requirements applying to NB IoT are not applicable to the
IAB-DU

### 7.2.2 IAB-MT reference sensitivity level 

The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference
measurement channel as specified in annex A.1 with parameters specified
in table 7.2.2-1 for Wide Area IAB-MT and in table 7.2.2-2 for Local
Area IAB-MT.

7.3 Dynamic range
-----------------

### 7.3.1 IAB-DU dynamic range 

#### 7.3.1.1 General

The dynamic range is specified as a measure of the capability of the
receiver to receive a wanted signal in the presence of an interfering
signal at the *TAB connector* for *IAB-DU type 1-H* inside the received
*IAB-DU channel bandwidth*. In this condition, a throughput requirement
shall be met for a specified reference measurement channel. The
interfering signal for the dynamic range requirement is an AWGN signal.

#### 7.3.1.2 Minimum requirement for *IAB-DU type 1-H*

The wide area IAB-DU dynamic range is specified the same as the wide
area BS dynamic requirement for BS *type 1-H* in TS 38.104 \[2\],
subclause 7.3.2, where references to *BS channel bandwidth* apply to
*IAB-DU channel bandwidth*.

The medium range IAB-DU dynamic range is specified the same as the
medium range BS dynamic range requirement for BS *type 1-H* in TS 38.104
\[2\], subclause 7.3.2, where references to *BS channel bandwidth* apply
to *IAB-DU channel bandwidth*.

The local area IAB-DU dynamic range is specified the same as the local
area BS dynamic range requirement for BS *type 1-H* in TS 38.104 \[2\],
subclause 7.3.2, where references to *BS channel bandwidth* apply to
*IAB-DU channel bandwidth*.

Referenced requirements applying to NB IoT are not applicable to the
IAB-DU

7.4 In-band selectivity and blocking
------------------------------------

### 7.4.1 Adjacent Channel Selectivity (ACS)

#### 7.4.1.1 General

Adjacent channel selectivity (ACS) is a measure of the receiver\'s
ability to receive a wanted signal at its assigned channel frequency at
the *TAB connector* for *IAB-MT type 1-H or IAB-DU type 1-H* in the
presence of an adjacent channel signal with a specified centre frequency
offset of the interfering signal to the band edge of a victim system.

#### 7.4.1.2 Minimum requirement for *IAB-DU type 1-H*

Minimum requirement is the same as specified for BS type 1-H in
TS38.104\[2\], subclause 7.4.1.2.

#### 7.4.1.3 Minimum requirement for *IAB-MT type 1-H*

The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference
measurement channel.

For IAB-MT, the wanted and the interfering signal coupled to the *IAB-MT
type 1-H* *TAB connector* are specified in table 7.4.1.3-1 and the
frequency offset between the wanted and interfering signal in table
7.4.1.3-2 for ACS. The reference measurement channel for the wanted
signal is identified in table 7.2.2-1 and 7.2.2-2 for each *IAB-MT
channel bandwidth* and further specified in annex A.1. The
characteristics of the interfering signal is further specified in annex
F.

The ACS requirement is applicable outside the *IAB-MT RF Bandwidth* or
*Radio Bandwidth*. The interfering signal offset is defined relative to
the *IAB-MT RF Bandwidth* edges or *Radio Bandwidth* edges.

For IAB-MT operating in *non-contiguous spectrum* within any *operating
band*, the ACS requirement shall apply in addition inside any *sub-block
gap*, in case the *sub-block gap size* is at least as wide as the NR
interfering signal in table 7.4.1.3-2. The interfering signal offset is
defined relative to the *sub-block* edges inside the *sub-block gap*.

For a *multi-band connector*, the ACS requirement shall apply in
addition inside any *Inter RF Bandwidth gap*, in case the *Inter RF
Bandwidth gap* size is at least as wide as the NR interfering signal in
table 7.4.1.3‑2. The interfering signal offset is defined relative to
the *IAB-MT RF Bandwidth edges* inside the *Inter RF Bandwidth gap*.

Minimum conducted requirement is defined at the *TAB connector* for
*IAB-MT type 1-H.*

### 7.4.2 In-band blocking

#### 7.4.2.1 General

The in-band blocking characteristics is a measure of the receiver\'s
ability to receive a wanted signal at its assigned channel at the *TAB
connector* for *IAB-DU type 1-H* and *IAB-MT type 1-H* in the presence
of an unwanted interferer, which is an NR signal for general blocking or
an NR signal with one resource block for narrowband blocking.

#### 7.4.2.2 Minimum requirement for IAB-DU type 1-H

Minimum requirement is the same as specified for BS type 1-H in
TS38.104\[2\], subclause 7.4.2.2.

#### 7.4.2.3 Minimum requirement for IAB-MT type 1-H

The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference
measurement channel, with a wanted and an interfering signal coupled to
*IAB-MT type 1‑H* *TAB connector* using the parameters in tables
7.4.2.3-1, 7.4.2.3-2 and 7.4.2.3-3 for general blocking and narrowband
blocking requirements. The reference measurement channel for the wanted
signal is identified in clause 7.2.2 for each *IAB-MT channel bandwidth*
and further specified in annex A.1. The characteristics of the
interfering signal is further specified in annex F.

The in-band blocking requirements apply outside the *IAB-MT RF
Bandwidth* or *Radio Bandwidth*. The interfering signal offset is
defined relative to the *IAB-MT RF Bandwidth edges* or *Radio Bandwidth*
edges.

The in-band blocking requirement shall apply from F~DL,low~ - Δf~OOB~ to
F~DL,high~ + Δf~OOB~. The Δf~OOB~ for *wide area IAB-MT type 1-H* is
defined in table 7.4.2.3-0.

Minimum conducted requirement is defined at the *TAB connector* for
*IAB-MT type 1-H.*

Table 7.4.2.3-0: Δf~OOB~ offset for NR *operating bands*

  IAB-MT type         *Operating band* characteristics              Δf~OOB~ (MHz)
  ------------------- --------------------------------------------- ---------------
  *IAB-MT type 1-H*   F~DL,high~ -- F~DL,low~ \< 100 MHz            20
                      100 MHz ≤ F~DL,high~ -- F~DL,low~ ≤ 900 MHz   60

For an IAB-MT operating in *non-contiguous spectrum* within any
*operating band*, the in-band blocking requirements apply in addition
inside any *sub-block gap*, in case the *sub-block gap* size is at least
as wide as twice the interfering signal minimum offset in tables
7.4.2.3-1. The interfering signal offset is defined relative to the
*sub-block* edges inside the *sub-block gap*.

For a *multi-band connector*, the blocking requirements apply in the
in-band blocking frequency ranges for each supported *operating band*.
The requirement shall apply in addition inside any *Inter RF Bandwidth
gap*, in case the *Inter RF Bandwidth gap* size is at least as wide as
twice the interfering signal minimum offset in tables 7.4.2.3-1.

For an IAB-MT operating in *non-contiguous spectrum* within any
*operating band*, the narrowband blocking requirement shall apply in
addition inside any *sub-block gap*, in case the *sub-block gap size* is
at least as wide as the *channel bandwidth* of the NR interfering signal
in Table 7.4.2.3-3. The interfering signal offset is defined relative to
the *sub-block* edges inside the *sub-block gap*.

For a *multi-band connector*, the narrowband blocking requirement shall
apply in addition inside any *Inter RF Bandwidth gap*, in case the
*Inter RF Bandwidth gap* size is at least as wide as the NR interfering
signal in Table 7.4.2.3-3. The interfering signal offset is defined
relative to the *IAB-MT RF Bandwidth* edges inside the *Inter RF
Bandwidth gap*.

7.5 Out-of-band blocking
------------------------

### 7.5.1 General

The out-of-band blocking characteristics is a measure of the receiver
ability to receive a wanted signal at its assigned channel at the *TAB
connector* for *IAB-DU type 1-H and IAB-MT type 1-H* in the presence of
an unwanted interferer out of the *operating band*, which is a CW signal
for out-of-band blocking.

### 7.5.6 Co-location minimum requirements for *IAB-MT type 1-H*

This additional blocking requirement may be applied for the protection
of IAB-MT receivers when GSM, CDMA, UTRA, E-UTRA, NR BS or IAB-Node
operating in a different frequency band are co-located with an IAB Node.
The requirement is applicable to all *IAB-MT channel bandwidths*
supported by the IAB Node.

The requirements in this clause assume a 30 dB coupling loss between
interfering transmitter and IAB Node receiver and are based on
co-location with base stations of the same class.

The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference
measurement channel, with a wanted and an interfering signal coupled to
*IAB type 1-H* *TAB connector* input using the parameters in table
7.5.6-1 for all the IAB Node classes. The reference measurement channel
for the wanted signal is identified in subclause 7.2.1 and subclause
7.2.2 for each *IAB-MT channel bandwidth* and further specified in annex
A.1.

The blocking requirement for co-location with BS or IAB-Node in other
bands is applied for all *operating bands* for which co-location
protection is provided.

Minimum conducted requirement is defined at the *TAB connector* for
*IAB-MT type 1-H.*

7.6 Receiver spurious emissions
-------------------------------

### 7.6.1 General

The receiver spurious emissions power is the power of emissions
generated or amplified in a receiver unit that appear at the *TAB
connector* (for *IAB-DU type 1-H and IAB-MT type 1-H*). The requirements
apply to all IAB-DU and IAB-MT with separate RX and TX *TAB connectors*.

For *TAB connectors* supporting both RX and TX in TDD, the requirements
apply during the *transmitter OFF period*.

For RX-only *multi-band* *connectors*, the spurious emissions
requirements are subject to exclusion zones in each supported *operating
band*. For *multi-band* *connectors* that both transmit and receive in
*operating band* supporting TDD, RX spurious emissions requirements are
applicable during the *TX OFF period*, and are subject to exclusion
zones in each supported *operating band*.

For *IAB-DU type 1-H* and *IAB-MT type 1-H* manufacturer shall declare
*TAB connector RX min cell groups*. *The declaration is done separately
for IAB-DU and IAB-MT.* Every *TAB connector* of *IAB-DU type 1‑H* and
*IAB-MT type 1-H* supporting reception in an *operating band* shall map
to one *TAB connector RX min cell group*, where mapping of *TAB
connectors* to cells/beams is implementation dependent.

The number of active receiver units that are considered when calculating
the conducted RX spurious emission limits (N~RXU,counted~) for IAB-DU
*type 1-H* and *IAB-MT type 1-H* is calculated as follows:

> N~RXU,counted~ = *min(N~RXU,active~ , 8* *× N~cells~)*

N~RXU,countedpercell~ is used for scaling of *basic limits* and is
derived as N~RXU,countedpercell~ = *N~RXU,counted~ / N~cells~, where
N~cells~ is defined in clause 6.1.*

> NOTE: N~RXU,active~ is the number of actually active receiver units
> and is independent to the declaration of N~cells~.

#### 7.6.2.2 Minimum requirement for IAB-DU type 1-H

The RX spurious emissions requirements for *IAB-DU type 1-H* are that
for each applicable *basic limit* specified in table 7.6.2.1-1 for each
*TAB connector RX min cell group,* the power sum of emissions at
respective *TAB connectors* shall not exceed the BS limits specified as
the *basic limit*s + X, where X = 10log~10~(N~RXU,countedpercell~),
unless stated differently in regional regulation.

The RX spurious emission requirements are applied per the *TAB connector
RX min cell group for all the configurations supported by the BS.*

> NOTE: Conformance to the IAB-DU receiver spurious emissions
> requirement can be demonstrated by meeting at least one of the
> following criteria as determined by the manufacturer:

1\) The sum of the spurious emissions power measured on each *TAB
connector* in the *TAB connector RX min cell group* shall be less than
or equal to the IAB-DU limit above for the respective frequency span.

Or

2\) The spurious emissions power at each *TAB connector* shall be less
than or equal to the IAB-DU limit as defined above for the respective
frequency span, scaled by -10log~10~(*n*), where *n* is the number of
*TAB connectors* in the *TAB connector RX min cell group*.

#### 7.6.3.2 Minimum requirement for IAB-MT type 1-H

The RX spurious emissions requirements for *IAB-MT type 1-H* are that
for each applicable *basic limit* specified in table 7.6.3.1-1 for each
*TAB connector RX min cell group,* the power sum of emissions at
respective *TAB connectors* shall not exceed the IAB-MT limits specified
as the *basic limit*s + X, where X = 10log~10~(N~RXU,countedpercell~),
unless stated differently in regional regulation.

The RX spurious emission requirements are applied per the *TAB connector
RX min cell group for all the configurations supported by the IAB-MT.*

NOTE: Conformance to the IAB-MT receiver spurious emissions requirement
can be demonstrated by meeting at least one of the following criteria as
determined by the manufacturer:

1\) The sum of the spurious emissions power measured on each *TAB
connector* in the *TAB connector RX min cell group* shall be less than
or equal to the IAB-MT limit above for the respective frequency span.

Or

2\) The spurious emissions power at each *TAB connector* shall be less
than or equal to the IAB-MT limit as defined above for the respective
frequency span, scaled by -10log~10~(*n*), where *n* is the number of
*TAB connectors* in the *TAB connector RX min cell group*.

7.7 Receiver intermodulation
----------------------------

### 7.7.1 General 

Third and higher order mixing of the two interfering RF signals can
produce an interfering signal in the band of the desired channel.
Intermodulation response rejection is a measure of the capability of the
receiver to receive a wanted signal on its assigned channel frequency at
TAB connector for IAB-DU type 1-H \[and IAB-MT type 1-H\] in the
presence of two interfering signals which have a specific frequency
relationship to the wanted signal.

### 7.7.2 Minimum requirement for *IAB-DU type 1-H*

The Wide Area IAB-DU receiver intermodulation requirement is specified
the same as the Wide Area receiver intermodulation requirement for BS
*type 1-H* in TS 38.104\[2\], subclause 7.7.2, where references to *BS
channel bandwidth* apply to *IAB-DU channel bandwidth*.

The Medium Range IAB-DU receiver intermodulation requirement is
specified the same as the Medium Range BS receiver intermodulation
requirement for BS *type 1-H* in TS 38.104\[2\], subclause 7.7.2, where
references to *BS channel bandwidth* apply to *IAB-DU channel
bandwidth*.

The Local Area IAB-DU receiver intermodulation requirement is specified
the same as the Local Area BS receiver intermodulation requirement for
BS *type 1-H* in TS 38.104\[2\], subclause 7.7.2, where references to
*BS channel bandwidth* apply to *IAB-DU channel bandwidth*.

Referenced requirements applying to NB-IoT are not applicable to the
IAB-DU

### 7.7.3 Minimum requirement for *IAB-MT type 1-H*

The Wide Aarea IAB-MT receiver intermodulation requirement is specified
the same as the Wide Area receiver intermodulation requirement for BS
*type 1-H* in TS 38.104\[2\], subclause 7.7.2, where references to *BS
channel bandwidth* apply to *IAB-MT channel bandwidth*.

The Local Area IAB-MT receiver intermodulation requirement is specified
the same as theLocal Area BS receiver intermodulation requirement for BS
*type 1-H* in TS 38.104\[2\], subclause 7.7.2, where references to *BS
channel bandwidth* apply to *IAB-MT channel bandwidth*.

Interfering signal for IAB-MT *type 1-H* should be CP-OFDM

7.8 In-channel selectivity
--------------------------

### 7.8.1 General

In-channel selectivity (ICS) is a measure of the receiver ability to
receive a wanted signal at its assigned resource block locations *TAB
connector* for *IAB-DU type 1-H* in the presence of an interfering
signal received at a larger power spectral density. In this condition a
throughput requirement shall be met for a specified reference
measurement channel. The interfering signal shall be an NR signal which
is time aligned with the wanted signal.

### 7.8.2 Minimum requirement for *IAB-DU type 1-H*

The wide area IAB-DU receiver in-channel selectivity requirement is
specified the same as the wide area receiver in-channel selectivity
requirement for BS *type 1-H* in TS 38.104\[2\], subclause 7.8.2, where
references to *BS channel bandwidth* apply to *IAB-DU channel
bandwidth*.

The medium range IAB-DU receiver in-channel selectivity requirement is
specified the same as the medium range BS receiver in-channel
selectivity requirement for BS *type 1-H* in TS 38.104\[2\], subclause
7.8.2, where references to *BS channel bandwidth* apply to *IAB-DU
channel bandwidth*.

The local area IAB-DU receiver in-channel selectivity requirement is
specified the same as the local area BS receiver in-channel selectivity
requirement for BS *type 1-H* in TS 38.104\[2\], subclause 7.8.2, where
references to *BS channel bandwidth* apply to *IAB-DU channel
bandwidth*.

Referenced requirements applying to NB-IoT are not applicable to the
IAB-DU

8 Conducted performance requirements
====================================

8.1 IAB-DU performance requirements
-----------------------------------

### 8.1.1 General

Conducted performance requirements specify the ability of the IAB type
1-H to correctly demodulate signals in various conditions and
configurations. Conducted performance requirements are specified at the
TAB connector(s).

Conducted performance requirements for the IAB-DU are specified for the
fixed reference channels defined in annex A and the propagation
conditions in annex I. The requirements only apply to those FRCs that
are supported by the IAB-DU.

Unless stated otherwise, performance requirements apply for a single
carrier only. Performance requirements for an IAB-DU supporting carrier
aggregation are defined in terms of single carrier requirements.

The SNR used in this clause is specified based on a single carrier and
defined as:

SNR = S / N

Where:

S is the total signal energy in the slot on a single TAB connector.

N is the noise energy in a bandwidth corresponding to the transmission
bandwidth over the duration of a slot on a single TAB connector.

### 8.1.2 Performance requirements for PUSCH 

#### 8.1.2.1 Requirements for PUSCH with transform precoding disabled

##### 8.1.2.1.1 General

The performance requirement of PUSCH is determined by a minimum required
throughput for a given SNR. The required throughput is expressed as a
fraction of maximum throughput for the FRCs listed in annex A. The
performance requirements assume HARQ retransmissions.

#### 8.1.2.2 Requirements for PUSCH with transform precoding enabled

##### 8.1.2.2.1 General

The performance requirement of PUSCH is determined by a minimum required
throughput for a given SNR. The required throughput is expressed as a
fraction of maximum throughput for the FRCs listed in annex A. The
performance requirements assume HARQ retransmissions.

#### 8.1.2.3 Requirements for UCI multiplexed on PUSCH

##### 8.1.2.3.1 General

In the tests for UCI multiplexed on PUSCH, the UCI information only
contains CSI part 1 and CSI part 2 information, and there is no HACK/ACK
information transmitted.

The CSI part 1 block error probability (BLER) is defined as the
probability of incorrectly decoding the CSI part 1 information when the
CSI part 1 information is sent as follow:

$\text{BLER}_{CSI\ part\ 1} = \ \frac{\#(false\ CSI\ part\ 1)}{\#(CSI\ part\ 1)}$

where:

\- \#(false CSI part 1) denotes the number of incorrectly decoded CSI
part 1 information transmitted occasions

\- \#(CSI part 1) denotes the number of CSI part 1 information
transmitted occasions.

The CSI part 2 block error probability is defined as the probability of
incorrectly decoding the CSI part 2 information when the CSI part 2
information is sent as follows:

$\text{BLER}_{CSI\ part\ 2} = \ \frac{\#(false\ CSI\ part\ 2)}{\#(CSI\ part\ 2)}$

where:

\- \#(false CSI part 2) denotes the number of incorrectly decoded CSI
part 2 information transmitted occasions

\- \#(CSI part 2) denotes the number of CSI part 2 information
transmitted occasions.

The number of UCI information bit payload per slot is defined for two
cases as follows:

\- 5 bits in CSI part 1, 2 bits in CSI part 2

\- 20 bits in CSI part 1, 20 bits in CSI part 2

The 7bits UCI case is further defined with the bitmap \[c0 c1 c2 c3 c4\]
= \[0 1 0 1 0\] for CSI part 1 information, where c0 is mapping to the
RI information, and with the bitmap \[c0 c1\] = \[1 0\] for CSI part2
information.

The 40bits UCI information case is assumed random information bit
selection.

In both tests, PUSCH data, CSI part 1 and CSI part 2 information are
transmitted simultaneously.

### 8.1.3 Performance requirements for PUCCH 

#### 8.1.3.1 DTX to ACK probability

##### 8.1.3.1.1 General

The DTX to ACK probability, i.e. the probability that ACK is detected
when nothing was sent:

$\text{Prob}\left( PUCCH\ DTX \rightarrow Ack\ bits \right) = \ \frac{\#(\text{false}\ \text{ACK}\ \text{bits})}{\#\left( \text{PUCCH\ DTX} \right)*\#(\text{ACK}/\text{NACK}\ \text{bits})}$

where:

\- \#(false ACK bits) denotes the number of detected ACK bits.

\- \#(ACK/NACK bits) denotes the number of encoded bits per slot

\- \#(PUCCH DTX) denotes the number of DTX occasions

##### 8.1.3.1.2 Minimum requirement

The DTX to ACK probability shall not exceed 1% for all PUCCH formats
carrying ACK/NACK bits:

$\text{Prob}\left( PUCCH\ DTX \rightarrow Ack\ bits \right)\  \leq \ 10^{- 2}$

#### 8.1.3.2 Performance requirements for PUCCH format 0

##### 8.1.3.2.1 General

The ACK missed detection probability is the probability of not detecting
an ACK when an ACK was sent.

#### 8.1.3.3 Performance requirements for PUCCH format 1

##### 8.1.3.3.1 NACK to ACK requirements

##### 8.1.3.3.1.1 General {#general-34 .H6}

The NACK to ACK detection probability is the probability that an ACK bit
is falsely detected when an NACK bit was sent on the particular bit
position, where the NACK to ACK detection probability is defined as
follows:

![](media/image13.wmf){width="4.173611111111111in"
height="0.3888888888888889in"},

where:

\- ![](media/image14.wmf){width="1.1805555555555556in"
height="0.20833333333333334in"}denotes the total number of NACK bits
transmitted

\- ![](media/image15.wmf){width="2.048611111111111in"
height="0.20833333333333334in"}denotes the number of NACK bits decoded
as ACK bits at the receiver, i.e. the number of received ACK bits

\- NACK bits in the definition do not contain the NACK bits which are
mapped from DTX, i.e. NACK bits received when DTX is sent should not be
considered.

Random codeword selection is assumed.

#### 8.1.3.6 Performance requirements for PUCCH format 4

##### 8.1.3.6.1 General

The performance is measured by the required SNR at UCI block error
probability not exceeding 1%.

The UCI block error probability is defined as the conditional
probability of incorrectly decoding the UCI information when the UCI
information is sent. The UCI information does not contain CSI part 2.

\[The transient period as specified in TS 38.101-1 \[3\] clause 6.3.3.1
is not taken into account for performance requirement testing, where the
RB hopping is symmetric to the centre, i.e. intra-slot frequency hopping
is enabled.\]

##### 8.1.3.7.2.1 ACK to NACK requirements {#ack-to-nack-requirements .H6}

##### 8.1.3.7.2.1.1 General {#general-41 .H6}

The NACK to ACK detection probability is the probability that an ACK bit
is falsely detected when an NACK bit was sent on the particular bit
position, where the NACK to ACK detection probability is defined as
follows:

![](media/image13.wmf){width="4.173611111111111in"
height="0.3888888888888889in"},

where:

\- ![](media/image14.wmf){width="1.1805555555555556in"
height="0.20833333333333334in"}denotes the total number of NACK bits
transmitted

\- ![](media/image15.wmf){width="2.048611111111111in"
height="0.20833333333333334in"}denotes the number of NACK bits decoded
as ACK bits at the receiver, i.e. the number of received ACK bits

\- NACK bits in the definition do not contain the NACK bits which are
mapped from DTX, i.e. NACK bits received when DTX is sent should not be
considered.

Random codeword selection is assumed.

### 8.1.4 Performance requirements for PRACH 

#### 8.1.4.1 PRACH false alarm probability

##### 8.1.4.1.1 General

The false alarm requirement is valid for any number of receive antennas,
for any channel bandwidth.

The false alarm probability is the conditional total probability of
erroneous detection of the preamble (i.e. erroneous detection from any
detector) when input is only noise.

##### 8.1.4.1.2 Minimum requirement

The false alarm probability shall be less than or equal to 0.1%.

#### 8.1.4.2 PRACH detection requirements

##### 8.1.4.2.1 General

The probability of detection is the conditional probability of correct
detection of the preamble when the signal is present. There are several
error cases -- detecting different preamble than the one that was sent,
not detecting a preamble at all or correct preamble detection but with
the wrong timing estimation. A timing estimation error occurs if the
estimation error of the timing of the strongest path is larger than the
time error tolerance given in Table 8.1.4.2.1-1.

8.2 IAB-MT requirements
-----------------------

### 8.2.1 General

Conducted performance requirements specify the ability of the *IAB-MT
type 1-H* to correctly demodulate signals in various conditions and
configurations. Conducted performance requirements are specified at the
*TAB connector(s)* (for *IAB-MT type 1-H*).

Conducted performance requirements for the IAB-MT are specified for the
fixed reference channels defined in annex A and the propagation
conditions in annex I. The requirements only apply to those FRCs that
are supported by the IAB-MT.

The SNR used in this clause is specified based on a single carrier and
defined as:

SNR = S / N

Where:

S is the total signal energy in the slot on a single *TAB connector*
(for *IAB-MT type 1-H*).

N is the noise energy in a bandwidth corresponding to the transmission
bandwidth over the duration of a slot on a single TAB connector (for
*IAB-MT type 1-H*).

### 8.2.2 Demodulation performance requirements

#### 8.2.2.1 Performance requirements for PDSCH

##### 8.2.2.1.1 General

The performance requirement of PDSCH is determined by a minimum required
throughput for a given SNR. The required throughput is expressed as a
fraction of maximum throughput for the FRCs listed in annex A. The
performance requirements assume HARQ retransmissions.

#### 8.2.3.2 Reporting of Channel Quality Indicator (CQI)

##### 8.2.3.2.1 General

The reporting accuracy of the channel quality indicator (CQI) under
frequency non-selective conditions is determined by the reporting
variance and the BLER performance using the transport format indicated
by the reported CQI median. The purpose is to verify that the reported
CQI values are in accordance with the CQI definition given in TS 38.214
\[11\]. To account for sensitivity of the input SNR the reporting
definition is considered to be verified if the reporting accuracy is met
for at least one of two SNR levels separated by an offset of 1 dB.

##### 8.2.3.2.2 Minimum requirements

For the parameters specified in Table 8.2.3.2.1-1, and using the
downlink physical channels specified in Annex A, the minimum
requirements are specified by the following:

> a\) The reported CQI value according to the reference channel shall be
> in the range of ±1 of the reported median more than 90% of the time.
>
> b\) If the PDSCH BLER using the transport format indicated by median
> CQI is less than or equal to 0.1, then the BLER using the transport
> format indicated by the (median CQI+1) shall be greater than 0.1. If
> the PDSCH BLER using the transport format indicated by the median CQI
> is greater than 0.1, then the BLER using transport format indicated by
> (median CQI-1) shall be less than or equal to 0.1.

#### 8.2.3.3 Reporting of Precoding Matrix Indicator (PMI)

##### 8.2.3.3.1 General

The minimum performance requirements of PMI reporting are defined based
on the precoding gain, expressed as the relative increase in throughput
when the transmitter is configured according to the IAB-MT reported PMI
compared to the case when the transmitter is using random precoding,
respectively. When the transmitter uses random precoding, for each PDSCH
allocation a precoder is randomly generated with equal propability of
each applicable i~1~ and i~2~ combination and applied to the PDSCH. A
fixed transport format (FRC) is configured for all requirements.

The requirements for transmission mode 1 with higher layer parameter
*codebookType* set to \'typeI-SinglePanel\' are specified in terms of
the ratio:

In the definition of *γ*, for 4TX, 8TX PMI requirements, is 90 % of the
maximum throughput obtained at using the precoders configured according
to the IAB-MT reports, and is the throughput measured at with random
precoding.

#### 8.2.3.4 Reporting of Rank Indicator (RI)

##### 8.2.3.4.1 General

The purpose of this test is to verify that the reported rank indicator
accurately represents the channel rank. The accuracy of RI reporting is
determined by the relative increase of the throughput obtained when
transmitting based on the reported rank compared to the case for which a
fixed rank is used for transmission.

##### 8.2.3.4.2 Minimum requirements

The minimum performance requirement in Table 8.2.3.4.2-1is defined as

a\) The ratio of the throughput obtained when transmitting based on
IAB-MT reported RI and that obtained when transmitting with fixed rank 1
shall be ≥ γ~1~;

b\) The ratio of the throughput obtained when transmitting based on
IAB-MT reported RI and that obtained when transmitting with fixed rank 2
shall be ≥ γ~2~;

For the parameters specified in Table 8.2.3.3.1-1 and using the downlink
physical channels specified in Annex A, the minimum requirements are
specified in Table 8.2.3.4.2-1.

9 Radiated transmitter characteristics
======================================

9.1 General
-----------

Radiated transmitter characteristics requirements apply on the *IAB-DU
and IAB-MT type 1-H*, *IAB-DU and IAB-MT type 1-O*, or *IAB-DU and
IAB-MT type 2-O* including all its functional components active and for
all foreseen modes of operation unless otherwise stated.

*For IAB-MT* *type 1-O manufacturer shall also declare N~TXU,active~.
N~TXU,active~* active transmitter units supporting the same *operating
band* *is implementation dependent.*

*The number of active transmitter units that are considered when
calculating the radiated TX emissions limits (N~TXU,counted~) for IAB-MT
type 1-O is calculated as follows:*

N~TXU,counted~ = *min(N~TXU,active~ , 8)*

N~TXU,countedpercell~ is used for scaling of *basic limits* and is
derived as N~TXU,countedpercell~ = *N~TXU,counted~*

NOTE: N~TXU,active~ depends on the actual number of *active transmitter
unit*s.

9.2 Radiated transmit power
---------------------------

### 9.2.1 General

*IAB-DU and IAB-MT type 1-H, IAB-DU and IAB-MT type 1-O* and *IAB-DU and
IAB-MT type 2-O* are declared to support one or more beams, as per
manufacturer\'s declarations. Radiated transmit power is defined as the
EIRP level for a declared beam at a specific *beam peak direction*.
Declarations are done for IAB-DU and IAB-MT separately.

For each beam, the requirement is based on declaration of a beam
identity, *reference beam direction pair*, beamwidth, *rated beam EIRP*,
*OTA peak directions set*, the *beam direction pairs* at the maximum
steering directions and their associated *rated beam EIRP* and
beamwidth(s).

For a declared beam and *beam direction pair*, the *rated beam EIRP*
level is the maximum power that the base station is declared to radiate
at the associated *beam peak direction* during the *transmitter ON
period*.

For each *beam peak direction* associated with a *beam direction pair*
within the *OTA peak directions set*, a specific *rated beam EIRP* level
may be claimed. Any claimed value shall be met within the accuracy
requirement as described below. *Rated beam EIRP* is only required to be
declared for the *beam direction pairs* subject to conformance testing.

NOTE 1: *OTA peak directions set* is set of *beam peak directions* for
which the EIRP accuracy requirement is intended to be met. The *beam
peak directions* are related to a corresponding contiguous range or
discrete list of *beam centre directions* by the *beam direction pairs*
included in the set.

NOTE 2: A *beam direction pair* is data set consisting of the *beam
centre direction* and the related *beam peak direction.*

NOTE 3: A declared EIRP value is a value provided by the manufacturer
for verification according to the conformance specification declaration
requirements, whereas a claimed EIRP value is provided by the
manufacturer to the equipment user for normal operation of the equipment
and is not subject to formal conformance testing.

For *operating bands* where the supported *fractional bandwidth* (FBW)
is larger than 6%, two rated carrier EIRP may be declared by
manufacturer:

set*. Thus the TRP accuracy requirement must be met for any beamforming
setting for which the *beam peak direction* is within the *OTA peak
directions set*. Declarations are made separately for IAB-DU and IAB-MT.

9.7 OTA unwanted emissions
--------------------------

### 9.7.1 General

Unwanted emissions consist of so-called out-of-band emissions and
spurious emissions according to ITU definitions ITU-R SM.329 \[16\]. In
ITU terminology, out of band emissions are unwanted emissions
immediately outside the *channel bandwidth* resulting from the
modulation process and non-linearity in the transmitter but excluding
spurious emissions. Spurious emissions are emissions which are caused by
unwanted transmitter effects such as harmonics emission, parasitic
emission, intermodulation products and frequency conversion products,
but exclude out of band emissions.

The OTA out-of-band emissions requirement for the *IAB-MT type 1-O.
IAB-DU type 1-O, IAB-DU type 1-O* and *IAB-DU type 2-O* transmitter is
specified both in terms of Adjacent Channel Leakage power Ratio (ACLR)
and operating band unwanted emissions (OBUE). OTA Unwanted emissions
outside of this frequency range are limited by an OTA spurious emissions
requirement.

The maximum offset of the operating band unwanted emissions mask from
the *operating band* edge is Δf~OBUE~. The value of Δf~OBUE~ is defined
in table 9.7.1-1 *IAB-DU type 1-O* and *type 2-O* and in table 9.7.1-2
*IAB-MT type 1-O* and *type 2-O* for NR *operating bands*.

Table 9.7.1-1: Maximum offset Δf~OBUE~ outside the downlink *operating
band for IAB-DU*

  IAB-DU type         *Operating band* characteristics              Δf~OBUE~ (MHz)
  ------------------- --------------------------------------------- ----------------
  *IAB-DU type 1-O*   F~DL,high~ -- F~DL,low~ \< 100 MHz            10
                      100 MHz ≤ F~DL,high~ -- F~DL,low~ ≤ 900 MHz   40
  *IAB-DU type 2-O*   F~DL,high~ -- F~DL,low~ ≤ 4000 MHz            1500

Table 9.7.1-2: Maximum offset Δf~OBUE~ outside the uplink *operating
band for IAB-MT*

  IAB-MT type         *Operating band* characteristics              Δf~OBUE~ (MHz)
  ------------------- --------------------------------------------- ----------------
  *IAB-MT type 1-O*   F~UL,high~ -- F~UL,low~ \< 100 MHz            10
                      100 MHz ≤ F~UL,high~ -- F~UL,low~ ≤ 900 MHz   40
  *IAB-MT type 2-O*   F~UL,high~ -- F~UL,low~ ≤ 4000 MHz            1500

The unwanted emission requirements are applied per cell for all the
configurations. Requirements for OTA unwanted emissions are captured
using TRP, *directional requirements* or co-location requirements as
described per requirement.

There is in addition a requirement for occupied bandwidth.

### 9.7.2 OTA occupied bandwidth

#### 9.7.2.1 General

The OTA occupied bandwidth is the width of a frequency band such that,
below the lower and above the upper frequency limits, the mean powers
emitted are each equal to a specified percentage β/2 of the total mean
transmitted power. See also recommendation ITU-R SM.328 \[3\].

The value of β/2 shall be taken as 0.5%.

The OTA occupied bandwidth requirement shall apply during the
*transmitter ON period* for a single transmitted carrier. The minimum
requirement below may be applied regionally. There may also be regional
requirements to declare the OTA occupied bandwidth according to the
definition in the present clause.

The OTA occupied bandwidth is defined as a *directional requirement* and
shall be met in the manufacturer\'s declared *OTA coverage range* at the
RIB.

#### 9.7.2.2 Minimum requirement for *IAB-DU type 1-O* and *IAB-DU type* 2-O

The OTA occupied bandwidth for each NR carrier shall be less than the
*IAB-DU channel bandwidth*. For intra-band contiguous CA, t**he OTA
occupied bandwidth shall be less than or equal to the *Aggregated IAB-DU
Channel Bandwidth.***

#### 9.7.2.3 Minimum requirement for *IAB-MT type 1-O* and *IAB-MT type* 2-O

The OTA occupied bandwidth for each NR carrier shall be less than the
*IAB-MT channel bandwidth*. For intra-band contiguous CA, t**he OTA
occupied bandwidth shall be less than or equal to the *Aggregated IAB-MT
Channel Bandwidth.***

### 9.7.3 OTA Adjacent Channel Leakage Power Ratio (ACLR)

#### 9.7.3.1 General

OTA Adjacent Channel Leakage power Ratio (ACLR) is the ratio of the
filtered mean power centred on the assigned channel frequency to the
filtered mean power centred on an adjacent channel frequency. The
measured power is TRP.

The requirement shall be applied per RIB during the *transmitter ON
period*.

#### 9.7.3.2 Minimum requirement for *IAB-DU type 1-O and IAB-MT type 1-O*

The ACLR (CACLR) absolute *basic limits* in table 6.6.3.2-2 + X,
6.6.3.2-5 + X (where and X = 9 dB for IAB-DU and X =
10log~10~(N~TXU,countedpercell~) for IAB-MT) or the ACLR (CACLR) *basic
limit* in table 6.6.3.2-1, 6.6.3.2-3 or 6.6.3.2-4, whichever is less
stringent, shall apply.

For a *RIB* operating in multi-carrier or contiguous CA, the ACLR
requirements in clause 6.6.3.2 shall apply to *IAB-DU* and *IAB-MT
channel bandwidths* of the outermost carrier for the frequency ranges
defined in table 6.6.3.2-1.For a RIB operating in *non-contiguous
spectrum*, the ACLR requirement in clause 6.6.3.2 shall apply in
*sub-block gaps* for the frequency ranges defined in table 6.6.3.2-3,
while the CACLR requirement in clause 6.6.3.2 shall apply in *sub-block
gaps* for the frequency ranges defined in table 6.6.3.2-4.

For a *multi-band RIB*, the ACLR requirement in clause 6.6.3.2 shall
apply in *Inter RF Bandwidth gaps* for the frequency ranges defined in
table 6.6.3.2-3, while the CACLR requirement in clause 6.6.3.2 shall
apply in *Inter RF Bandwidth gaps* for the frequency ranges defined in
table 6.6.3.2-4.

#### 9.7.3.3 Minimum requirement for *IAB-DU type 2-O and Wide Area IAB-MT type 2-O*

The OTA ACLR limit is specified in table 9.7.3.3-1.

The OTA ACLR absolute limit is specified in table 9.7.3.3-2.

The OTA ACLR (CACLR) absolute limit in table 9.7.3.3-2 or 9.7.3.3-5 or
the ACLR (CACLR) limit in table 9.7.3.3-1, 9.7.3.3-3 or 9.7.3.3-4,
whichever is less stringent, shall apply.

For a *RIB* operating in multi-carrier or contiguous CA, the OTA ACLR
requirements in table 9.7.3.3-1 shall apply to *IAB-DU* and *IAB-MT
channel bandwidths* of the outermost carrier for the frequency ranges
defined in the table.For a RIB operating in *non-contiguous spectrum*,
the OTA ACLR requirement in table 9.7.3.3-3 shall apply in *sub-block
gaps* for the frequency ranges defined in the table, while the OTA CACLR
requirement in table 9.7.3.3-4 shall apply in *sub-block gaps* for the
frequency ranges defined in the table.

The CACLR in a *sub-block gap* is the ratio of:

a\) the sum of the filtered mean power centred on the assigned channel
frequencies for the two carriers adjacent to each side of the *sub-block
gap*, and

b\) the filtered mean power centred on a frequency channel adjacent to
one of the respective *sub-block* edges.

The assumed filter for the adjacent channel frequency is defined in
table 9.7.3.3-4 and the filters on the assigned channels are defined in
table 9.7.3.3-6.

For operation in *non-contiguous spectrum*, the CACLR for NR carriers
located on either side of the *sub-block gap* shall be higher than the
value specified in table 9.7.3.3-4.

#### 9.7.3.4 Minimum requirement for *Local Area IAB-MT type 2-O*

The OTA ACLR limit is specified in table 9.7.3.4-1.

The OTA ACLR absolute limit is specified in table 9.7.3.4-2.

The OTA ACLR (CACLR) absolute limit in table 9.7.3.4-2 or 9.7.3.4-5 or
the ACLR (CACLR) limit in table 9.7.3.4-1, 9.7.3.4-3 or 9.7.3.4-4,
whichever is less stringent, shall apply.

Requirements specified for Local Area IAB-DU type 2-O in clause 9.7.3.3
shall apply to Local Area IAB-MT type 2-O during transmission in DL
timeslot.

For a *RIB* operating in multi-carrier or contiguous CA, the OTA ACLR
requirements in table 9.7.3.4-1 shall apply to *IAB-MT channel
bandwidths* of the outermost carrier for the frequency ranges defined in
the table.For a RIB operating in *non-contiguous spectrum*, the OTA ACLR
requirement in table 9.7.3.4-3 shall apply in *sub-block gaps* for the
frequency ranges defined in the table, while the OTA CACLR requirement
in table 9.7.3.4-4 shall apply in *sub-block gaps* for the frequency
ranges defined in the table.

The CACLR in a *sub-block gap* is the ratio of:

a\) the sum of the filtered mean power centred on the assigned channel
frequencies for the two carriers adjacent to each side of the *sub-block
gap*, and

b\) the filtered mean power centred on a frequency channel adjacent to
one of the respective *sub-block* edges.

The assumed filter for the adjacent channel frequency is defined in
table 9.7.3.4-4 and the filters on the assigned channels are defined in
table 9.7.3.4-6.

For operation in *non-contiguous spectrum*, the CACLR for NR carriers
located on either side of the *sub-block gap* shall be higher than the
value specified in table 9.7.3.4-4.

### 9.7.4 OTA operating band unwanted emissions

#### 9.7.4.1 General

The OTA limits for operating band unwanted emissions are specified as
TRP per RIB unless otherwise stated.

#### 9.7.4.2 Minimum requirement for *IAB-DU type 1-O*

Out-of-band emissions in FR1 are limited by OTA operating band unwanted
emission limits. Unless otherwise stated, the operating band unwanted
emission limits in FR1 are defined from Δf~OBUE~ below the lowest
frequency of each supported downlink *operating band* up to Δf~OBUE~
above the highest frequency of each supported downlink *operating band*.
The values of Δf~OBUE~ are defined in table 9.7.1-1 for the NR
*operating bands*.

The requirements shall apply whatever the type of transmitter considered
and for all transmission modes foreseen by the manufacturer\'s
specification. For a *RIB* operating in multi-carrier or contiguous CA,
the requirements apply to *IAB-DU channel bandwidths* of the outermost
carrier for the frequency ranges defined in clause 6.6.4.1.

For a *RIB* operating in *non-contiguous spectrum*, the requirements
shall apply inside any *sub-block gap* for the frequency ranges defined
in clause 6.6.4.1.

For a *multi-band RIB*, the requirements shall apply inside any *Inter
RF Bandwidth gap* for the frequency ranges defined in clause 6.6.4.1.

The OTA operating band unwanted emission requirement for *IAB-DU type
1-O* is that for each applicable *basic limit* in clause 6.6.4.2, the
power of any unwanted emission shall not exceed an OTA limit specified
as the *basic limit* + X, where X = 9 dB.

#### 9.7.4.3 Minimum requirement for *IAB-MT type 1-O*

Out-of-band emissions in FR1 are limited by OTA operating band unwanted
emission limits. Unless otherwise stated, the operating band unwanted
emission limits in FR1 are defined from Δf~OBUE~ below the lowest
frequency of each supported uplink *operating band* up to Δf~OBUE~ above
the highest frequency of each supported uplink *operating band*. The
values of Δf~OBUE~ are defined in table 9.7.1-2 for the NR *operating
bands*.

The requirements shall apply whatever the type of transmitter considered
and for all transmission modes foreseen by the manufacturer\'s
specification. For a *RIB* operating in multi-carrier or contiguous CA,
the requirements apply to *IAB-MT channel bandwidths* of the outermost
carrier for the frequency ranges defined in clause 6.6.4.1.

For a *RIB* operating in *non-contiguous spectrum*, the requirements
shall apply inside any *sub-block gap* for the frequency ranges defined
in clause 6.6.4.1.

For a *multi-band RIB*, the requirements shall apply inside any *Inter
RF Bandwidth gap* for the frequency ranges defined in clause 6.6.4.1.

The OTA operating band unwanted emission requirement for *IAB-MT type
1-O* is that for each applicable *basic limit* in clause 6.6.4.2, the
power of any unwanted emission shall not exceed an OTA limit specified
as the *basic limit* + X, where X = 10log~10~(N~TXU,countedpercell~) dB.

#### 9.7.4.4 Additional requirements

##### 9.7.4.4.1 Limits in FCC Title 47

The IAB-DU and IAB-MT may have to comply with the applicable emission
limits established by FCC Title 47 \[20\], when deployed in regions
where those limits are applied, and under the conditions declared by the
manufacturer.

#### 9.7.4.5 Minimum requirement for *IAB-DU type 2-O and IAB-MT type 2-O*

##### 9.7.4.5.1 General

The requirements of either clause 9.7.4.5.2 (Category A limits) or
clause 9.7.4.5.3 (Category B limits) shall apply. The application of
either Category A or Category B limits shall be the same as for General
OTA transmitter spurious emissions requirements (*IAB-DU and IAB-MT type
2-O*) in clause 9.7.6.3.2. In addition, the limits in clause 9.7.4.5.4
may also apply.

Out-of-band emissions in FR2 are limited by OTA operating band unwanted
emission limits.

For IAB-DU type 2-O, unless otherwise stated, the OTA operating band
unwanted emission limits in FR2 are defined from Δf~OBUE~ below the
lowest frequency of each supported downlink *operating band* up to
Δf~OBUE~ above the highest frequency of each supported downlink
*operating band*.

For IAB-MT type 2-O, unless otherwise stated, the OTA operating band
unwanted emission limits in FR2 are defined from Δf~OBUE~ below the
lowest frequency of each supported uplink *operating band* up to
Δf~OBUE~ above the highest frequency of each supported uplink *operating
band*.

The values of Δf~OBUE~ are defined in table 9.7.1-1 and 9.7.1-2 for the
NR *operating bands*.

The requirements shall apply whatever the type of transmitter considered
and for all transmission modes foreseen by the manufacturer\'s
specification. For a *RIB* operating in multi-carrier or contiguous CA,
the requirements apply to the frequencies (Δf~OBUE~) starting from the
edge of the *contiguous transmission bandwidth.* In addition, for a
*RIB* operating in *non-contiguous spectrum*, the requirements apply
inside any *sub-block gap*.

Emissions shall not exceed the maximum levels specified in the tables
below, where:

\- ∆f is the separation between the *contiguous transmission bandwidth*
edge frequency and the nominal -3dB point of the measuring filter
closest to the *contiguous transmission bandwidth* edge.

\- f\_offset is the separation between the *contiguous transmission
bandwidth* edge frequency and the centre of the measuring filter.

\- f\_offset~max~ is the offset to the frequency Δf~OBUE~ outside the
downlink *operating band*, where Δf~OBUE~ is defined in table 9.7.1-1.

\- ∆f~max~ is equal to f\_offset~max~ minus half of the bandwidth of the
measuring filter.

In addition, inside any *sub-block gap* for a *RIB* operating in
*non-contiguous spectrum*, emissions shall not exceed the cumulative sum
of the *limits* specified for the adjacent *sub-blocks* on each side of
the *sub-block gap*. The *limit* for each *sub-block* is specified in
clauses 9.7.4.5.2 and 9.7.4.5.3 below, where in this case:

\- ∆f is the separation between the *sub-block* edge frequency and the
nominal -3 dB point of the measuring filter closest to the *sub-block*
edge.

\- f\_offset is the separation between the *sub-block* edge frequency
and the centre of the measuring filter.

\- f\_offset~max~ is equal to the *sub-block gap* bandwidth minus half
of the bandwidth of the measuring filter.

\- ∆f~max~ is equal to f\_offset~max~ minus half of the bandwidth of the
measuring filter.

##### 9.7.4.5.2 OTA operating band unwanted emission limits (Category A)

IAB-DU and IAB-MT unwanted emissions shall not exceed the maximum levels
specified in table 9.7.4.3.2‑1 and 9.7.4.3.2-2.

### 9.7.5 OTA transmitter spurious emissions

#### 9.7.5.1 General

Unless otherwise stated, all requirements are measured as mean power.

The OTA spurious emissions limits are specified as TRP per RIB unless
otherwise stated.

#### 9.7.5.2 Minimum requirement for *IAB-DU type 1-O and IAB-MT type 1-O*

##### 9.7.5.2.1 General

For IAB-DU, the OTA transmitter spurious emission limits for FR1 shall
apply from 30 MHz to 12.75 GHz, excluding the frequency range from
Δf~OBUE~ below the lowest frequency of each supported downlink
*operating band*, up to Δf~OBUE~ above the highest frequency of each
supported downlink *operating band*, where the Δf~OBUE~ is defined in
table 9.7.1-1. For some FR1 *operating bands*, the upper limit is higher
than 12.75 GHz in order to comply with the 5^th^ harmonic limit of the
downlink *operating band*, as specified in ITU-R recommendation SM.329
\[16\].

For IAB-MT, the OTA transmitter spurious emission limits for FR1 shall
apply from 30 MHz to 12.75 GHz, excluding the frequency range from
Δf~OBUE~ below the lowest frequency of each supported uplink *operating
band*, up to Δf~OBUE~ above the highest frequency of each supported
uplink *operating band*, where the Δf~OBUE~ is defined in table 9.7.1-2.
For some FR1 *operating bands*, the upper limit is higher than 12.75 GHz
in order to comply with the 5^th^ harmonic limit of the uplink
*operating band*, as specified in ITU-R recommendation SM.329 \[16\].

For *multi-band RIB* each supported *operating band* and Δf~OBUE~ MHz
around each band are excluded from the OTA transmitter spurious
emissions requirements.

The requirements shall apply whatever the type of transmitter considered
(single carrier or multi-carrier). It applies for all transmission modes
foreseen by the manufacturer\'s specification.

*IAB-DU type 1-O* and *IAB-MT type 1-O* requirements consist of OTA
transmitter spurious emission requirements based on TRP and co-location
requirements not based on TRP.

##### 9.7.5.2.2 General OTA transmitter spurious emissions requirements

The Tx spurious emissions requirements for *IAB-DU type 1-O* are that
for each applicable *basic limit* above 30 MHz in clause 6.6.5.2.1, the
TRP of any spurious emission shall not exceed an OTA limit specified as
the *basic limit* + X, where X = 9 dB, unless stated differently in
regional regulation.

The Tx spurious emissions requirements for *IAB-MT type 1-O* are that
for each applicable *basic limit* above 30 MHz in clause 6.6.5.2.1, the
TRP of any spurious emission shall not exceed an OTA limit specified as
the *basic limit* + X, where X = 10log~10~(N~TXU,countedpercell~) dB,
unless stated differently in regional regulation.

##### 9.7.5.2.3 Additional spurious emissions requirements

These requirements may be applied for the protection of systems
operating in frequency ranges other than IAB-DU downlink *operating band
or IAB-MT uplink operating band*. The limits may apply as an optional
protection of such systems that are deployed in the same geographical
area as the IAB-Node, or they may be set by local or regional regulation
as a mandatory requirement for an NR *operating band*. It is in some
cases not stated in the present document whether a requirement is
mandatory or under what exact circumstances that a limit applies, since
this is set by local or regional regulation. An overview of regional
requirements in the present document is given in clause 4.5.

Some requirements may apply for the protection of specific equipment
(UE, MS and/or BS) or equipment operating in specific systems (GSM,
CDMA, UTRA, E-UTRA, NR, etc.). The Tx additional spurious emissions
requirements for *IAB-DU type 1-O and IAB-MT type 1-O* are that for each
applicable *basic limit* in clause 6.6.5.2.2, the TRP of any spurious
emission shall not exceed an OTA limit specified as the *basic limit* +
X, where X = 9 dB for IAB-DU and X = 10log~10~(N~TXU,countedpercell~) dB
for IAB-MT.

##### 9.7.5.2.4 Co-location with other base stations and IAB-Nodes

These requirements may be applied for the protection of other receivers
when GSM900, DCS1800, PCS1900, GSM850, CDMA850, UTRA FDD, UTRA TDD,
E-UTRA, NR BS, IAB-DU and/or IAB-MT are co-located with an IAB-Node.

The requirements assume co-location with the same class.

NOTE: For co-location with UTRA, the requirements are based on
co-location with UTRA FDD or TDD base stations.

This requirement is a co-location requirement as defined in clause 4.9,
the power levels are specified at the *co-location reference antenna*
output(s).

The power sum of any spurious emission is specified over all supported
polarizations at the output(s) of the *co-location reference antenna*
and shall not exceed the *basic limits* in clause 6.6.5.2.3 + X dB,
where X = -21 dB for IAB-DU and X = -30 +
10log~10~(N~TXU,countedpercell~) dB for IAB-MT.

For a *multi-band RIB*, the exclusions and conditions in the notes
column of table 6.6.5.2.3-1 apply for each supported *operating band*.

#### 9.7.5.3 Minimum requirement for *IAB-DU type 2-O and IAB-MT type 2-O*

##### 9.7.5.3.1 General

For IAB-DU type 2-O, the OTA transmitter spurious emission limits apply
from 30 MHz to 2^nd^ harmonic of the upper frequency edge of the
downlink *operating band*, excluding the frequency range from Δf~OBUE~
below the lowest frequency of the downlink *operating band*, up to
Δf~OBUE~ above the highest frequency of the downlink *operating band*,
where the Δf~OBUE~ is defined in table 9.7.1-1.

For IAB-MT type 2-O, the OTA transmitter spurious emission limits apply
from 30 MHz to 2^nd^ harmonic of the upper frequency edge of the
downlink *operating band*, excluding the frequency range from Δf~OBUE~
below the lowest frequency of the uplink *operating band*, up to
Δf~OBUE~ above the highest frequency of the uplink *operating band*,
where the Δf~OBUE~ is defined in table 9.7.1-2.

##### 9.7.5.3.2 General OTA transmitter spurious emissions requirements

###### 9.7.5.3.2.1 General

The requirements of either clause 9.7.5.3.2.2 (Category A limits) or
clause 9.7.5.3.2.3 (Category B limits) shall apply. The application of
either Category A or Category B limits shall be the same as for
Operating band unwanted emissions in clause 9.7.4.

###### 9.7.5.3.2.2 OTA transmitter spurious emissions (Category A)

The power of any spurious emission shall not exceed the limits in table
9.7.5.3.2-1

##### 9.7.5.3.3 Additional OTA transmitter spurious emissions requirements

These requirements may be applied for the protection of systems
operating in frequency ranges other than the IAB-Node. The limits may
apply as an optional protection of such systems that are deployed in the
same geographical area as the IAB-Node, or they may be set by local or
regional regulation as a mandatory requirement for an NR operating band.
It is in some cases not stated in the present document whether a
requirement is mandatory or under what exact circumstances that a limit
applies, since this is set by local or regional regulation. An overview
of regional requirements in the present document is given in clause 4.5.

9.8 OTA transmitter intermodulation
-----------------------------------

### 9.8.1 General

The OTA transmitter intermodulation requirement is a measure of the
capability of the transmitter unit to inhibit the generation of signals
in its non-linear elements caused by presence of the wanted signal and
an interfering signal reaching the transmitter unit via the RDN and
antenna array from a co-located base station or IAB. The requirement
applies during the *transmitter ON period* and the *transmitter
transient period.*

The requirement shall apply at each RIB supporting transmission in the
*operating band*.

The transmitter intermodulation level is the *total radiated power* of
the intermodulation products when an interfering signal is injected into
the *co-location reference antenna*.

The OTA transmitter intermodulation requirement is not applicable for
*IAB type 2-O*.

### 9.8.2 Minimum requirement for *IAB-DU type 1-O* and *IAB-MT type 1-O*

For *IAB type 1-O* the transmitter intermodulation level shall not
exceed the TRP unwanted emission limits specified for OTA transmitter
spurious emission in clause 9.7.5.2 (except clause 9.7.5.2.3), OTA
operating band unwanted emissions in clauses 9.7.4.2 and 9.7.4.3, and
OTA ACLR in clause 9.7.3.2 in the presence of a wanted signal and an
interfering signal, defined in table 9.8.2-1.

The requirement is applicable outside the *IAB RF Bandwidth edges*. The
interfering signal offset is defined relative to the *IAB RF Bandwidth*
*edges* or *Radio Bandwidth* edges.

For RIBs supporting operation in *non-contiguous spectrum*, the
requirement is also applicable inside a *sub-block gap* for interfering
signal offsets where the interfering signal falls completely within the
*sub-block gap*. The interfering signal offset is defined relative to
the *sub-block* edges.

For RIBs supporting operation in multiple *operating bands*, the
requirement shall apply relative to the *IAB RF Bandwidth* *edges* of
each *operating band*. In case the *inter RF Bandwidth gap* is less than
3\*BW~Channel~ (where BW~Channel~ is the minimal *IAB-DU Channel
Bandwidth* or IAB-MT Channel Bandwidth of the band), the requirement in
the gap shall apply only for interfering signal offsets where the
interfering signal falls completely within the *inter RF Bandwidth gap*.

10 Radiated receiver characteristics
====================================

10.1 General
------------

Radiated receiver characteristics are specified at RIB for *IAB type
1-H*, *IAB type 1-O*, or *IAB type 2-O*, with full complement of
transceivers for the configuration in normal operating condition.

Unless otherwise stated, the following arrangements apply for the
radiated receiver characteristics requirements in clause 10:

\- Requirements apply during the IAB receive period.

\- Requirements shall be met for any transmitter setting.

\- Throughput requirements defined for the radiated receiver
characteristics do not assume HARQ retransmissions.

\- When IAB is configured to receive multiple carriers, all the
throughput requirements are applicable for each received carrier.

\- For ACS, blocking and intermodulation characteristics, the negative
offsets of the interfering signal apply relative to the lower *IAB RF
Bandwidth* edge or *sub-block* edge inside a *sub-block gap*, and the
positive offsets of the interfering signal apply relative to the upper
*IAB RF Bandwidth* edge or *sub-block* edge inside a *sub-block gap*.

\- Each requirement shall be met over the RoAoA specified.

NOTE 2: In normal operating condition the IAB in TDD operation is
configured to TX OFF power during *receive period*.

For FR1 requirements which are to be met over the *OTA REFSENS RoAoA*
absolute requirement values are offset by the following term:

Δ~OTAREFSENS~ = 44.1 - 10\*log~10~(BeW~θ,REFSENS\*~BeW~φ,REFSENS~) dB
for the reference direction

and

Δ~OTAREFSENS~ = 41.1 - 10\*log~10~(BeW~θ,REFSENS\*~BeW~φ,REFSENS~) dB
for all other directions

For requirements which are to be met over the *minSENS RoAoA* absolute
requirement values are offset by the following term:

Δ~minSENS~ = P~REFSENS~ -- EIS~minSENS~ (dB)

For FR2 requirements which are to be met over the *OTA REFSENS RoAoA*
absolute requirement values are offset by the following term:

Δ~FR2\_REFSENS~ = -3 dB for the reference direction

and

Δ~FR2\_REFSENS~ = 0 dB for all other directions

10.2 OTA sensitivity
--------------------

### 10.2.1 IAB-DU OTA sensitivity

#### 10.2.1.1 IAB-DU type 1-H and IAB-DU type 1-O

The OTA sensitivity requirement is a *directional requirement* based
upon the declaration of one or more *OTA sensitivity directions
declaration* (OSDD), related to a *IAB-DU type 1-H* and *IAB-DU type
1-O* receiver.

The IAB-DU reference sensitivity level is specified the same as the BS
reference sensitivity level requirement for BS in TS 38.104 \[2\],
subclause 10.2.1, where references to *BS channel bandwidth* apply to
*IAB-DU channel bandwidth*.

#### 10.2.1.2 IAB-DU type 2-O

There is no OTA sensitivity requirement for FR2, the OTA sensitivity is
the same as the OTA reference sensitivity in clause 10.3.

### 10.2.2 IAB-MT OTA sensitivity

#### 10.2.2.1 IAB-MT type 1-H and IAB-MT type 1-O

###### 10.2.2.1.1 General

The OTA sensitivity requirement is a *directional requirement* based
upon the declaration of one or more *OTA sensitivity directions
declaration* (OSDD), related to a *IAB-MT type 1-H* and *IAB-MT type
1-O* receiver.

The *IAB-MT type 1-H* and *IAB-MT type 1-O* may optionally be capable of
redirecting/changing the *receiver target* by means of adjusting IAB-MT
settings resulting in multiple *sensitivity RoAoA*. The *sensitivity
RoAoA* resulting from the current IAB-MT settings is the active
*sensitivity RoAoA*.

If the IAB-MT is capable of redirecting the *receiver target* related to
the OSDD then the OSDD shall include:

\- *IAB-MT channel bandwidth* and declared minimum EIS level applicable
to any active *sensitivity RoAoA* inside the *receiver target
redirection range* in the OSDD.

\- A declared *receiver target redirection range*, describing all the
angles of arrival that can be addressed for the OSDD through alternative
settings in the IAB-MT.

\- Five declared *sensitivity RoAoA* comprising the conformance testing
directions as detailed in TS 38.141‑2 \[21\].

\- The *receiver target reference direction*.

NOTE 1: Some of the declared *sensitivity RoAoA* may coincide depending
on the redirection capability.

NOTE 2: In addition to the declared *sensitivity RoAoA*, several
*sensitivity RoAoA* may be implicitly defined by the *receiver target
redirection range* without being explicitly declared in the OSDD.

If the IAB-MT is not capable of redirecting the *receiver target*
related to the OSDD, then the OSDD includes only:

\- The set(s) of RAT, *IAB-MT channel bandwidth* and declared minimum
EIS level applicable to the *sensitivity RoAoA* in the OSDD.

\- One declared active *sensitivity RoAoA*.

\- The *receiver target reference direction*.

NOTE 4: For IAB-MT without target redirection capability, the declared
(fixed) *sensitivity RoAoA* is always the active *sensitivity RoAoA*.

The OTA sensitivity EIS level declaration shall apply to each supported
polarization, under the assumption of *polarization match*.

###### 10.2.2.1.2 Minimum requirement

For a received signal whose AoA of the incident wave is within the
active *sensitivity RoAoA* of an OSDD, the error rate criterion as
described in clause 7.2.2 shall be met when the level of the arriving
signal is equal to the minimum EIS level in the respective declared set
of EIS level and *IAB-MT channel bandwidth*.

#### 10.2.2.2 IAB-MT type 2-O

There is no OTA sensitivity requirement for FR2, the OTA sensitivity is
the same as the OTA reference sensitivity in clause 10.3.

10.3 OTA reference sensitivity level
------------------------------------

### 10.3.1 General

The OTA REFSENS requirement is a *directional requirement* and is
intended to ensure the minimum OTA reference sensitivity level for a
declared *OTA REFSENS RoAoA*. The OTA reference sensitivity power level
EIS~REFSENS~ is the minimum mean power received at the RIB at which a
reference performance requirement shall be met for a specified reference
measurement channel.

The OTA REFSENS requirement shall apply to each supported polarization,
under the assumption of *polarization match*.

### 10.3.2 IAB-DU OTA reference sensitivity level

#### 10.3.2.1 Minimum requirement for *IAB-DU type 1-O*

The wide area IAB-DU reference sensitivity level is specified the same
as the wide area BS reference sensitivity level requirement for BS in TS
38.104\[2\], subclause 10.3.2, where references to *BS channel
bandwidth* apply to *IAB-DU channel bandwidth*.

The medium range IAB-DU reference sensitivity level is specified the
same as the medium range BS reference sensitivity level requirement for
BS in TS 38.104\[2\], subclause 10.3.2, where references to *BS channel
bandwidth* apply to *IAB-DU channel bandwidth*.

The local area IAB-DU reference sensitivity level is specified the same
as the local area BS reference sensitivity level requirement for BS in
TS 38.104\[2\], subclause 10.3.2, where references to *BS channel
bandwidth* apply to *IAB-DU channel bandwidth*.

#### 10.3.2.2 Minimum requirement for *IAB-DU type 2-O*

The wide area IAB-DU reference sensitivity level is specified the same
as the wide area BS reference sensitivity level requirement for BS in TS
38.104\[2\], subclause 10.3.3, where references to *BS channel
bandwidth* apply to *IAB-DU channel bandwidth*.

The medium range IAB-DU reference sensitivity level is specified the
same as the medium range BS reference sensitivity level requirement for
BS in TS 38.104\[2\], subclause 10.3.3, where references to *BS channel
bandwidth* apply to *IAB-DU channel bandwidth*.

The local area IAB-DU reference sensitivity level is specified the same
as the local area BS reference sensitivity level requirement for BS in
TS 38.104\[2\], subclause 10.3.3, where references to *BS channel
bandwidth* apply to *IAB-DU channel bandwidth*.

### 10.3.3 IAB-MT OTA reference sensitivity level

#### 10.3.3.1 General

The OTA REFSENS requirement is a *directional requirement* and is
intended to ensure the minimum OTA reference sensitivity level for a
declared *OTA REFSENS RoAoA*. The OTA reference sensitivity power level
EIS~REFSENS~ is the minimum mean power received at the RIB at which a
reference performance requirement shall be met for a specified reference
measurement channel.

#### 10.3.3.2 Minimum requirement for *IAB-MT type 1-O*

The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference
measurement channel as specified in the corresponding table and annex
A.1 when the OTA test signal is at the corresponding EIS~REFSENS~ level
and arrives from any direction within the *OTA REFSENS RoAoA.*

#### 10.3.3.3 Minimum requirement for *IAB-MT type 2-O*

The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference
measurement channel as specified in the corresponding table and annex
A.1 when the OTA test signal is at the corresponding EIS~REFSENS~ level
and arrives from any direction within the *OTA REFSENS RoAoA*.

EIS~REFSENS~ levels are derived from a single declared basis level
EIS~REFSENS\_50M,~ which is based on a reference measurement channel
with 50 MHz *IAB-MT channel bandwidth*. EIS~REFSENS\_50M~ itself is not
a requirement and although it is based on a reference measurement
channel with 50 MHz *IAB-MT channel bandwidth* it does not imply that
IAB-MT has to support 50 MHz *IAB-MT channel bandwidth*.

For Wide Area IAB-MT, EIS~REFSENS\_50M~ is an integer value in the range
-96 to -119 dBm. The specific value is declared by the vendor.

For Local Area IAB-MT, EIS~REFSENS\_50M~ is an integer value in the
range -86 to -114 dBm. The specific value is declared by the vendor.

10.4 OTA Dynamic range
----------------------

### 10.4.1 IAB-DU OTA dynamic range

#### 10.4.1.1 General

The OTA dynamic range is a measure of the capability of the receiver
unit to receive a wanted signal in the presence of an interfering signal
inside the received *\[IAB-DU\] channel bandwidth*.

The requirement shall apply at the RIB when the AoA of the incident wave
of a received signal and the interfering signal are from the same
direction and are within the *OTA REFSENS RoAoA.*

The wanted and interfering signals apply to each supported polarization,
under the assumption of *polarization match*.

#### 10.4.1.2 Minimum requirement for *IAB-DU type 1-O*

The wide area IAB-DU dynamic range is specified the same as the wide
area BS dynamic requirement for BS *type 1-O* in TS 38.104\[2\],
subclause 10.4.2, where references to *BS channel bandwidth* apply to
*IAB-DU channel bandwidth*.

The medium range IAB-DU dynamic range is specified the same as the
medium range BS dynamic range requirement for BS *type 1-O* in TS
38.104\[2\], subclause 10.4.2, where references to *BS channel
bandwidth* apply to *IAB-DU channel bandwidth*.

The local area IAB-DU dynamic range is specified the same as the local
area BS dynamic range requirement for BS *type 1-O* in TS 38.104\[2\],
subclause 10.4.2, where references to *BS channel bandwidth* apply to
*IAB-DU channel bandwidth*.

10.5 OTA in-band selectivity and blocking
-----------------------------------------

### 10.5.1 OTA adjacent channel selectivity

#### 10.5.1.1 General

OTA Adjacent channel selectivity (ACS) is a measure of the receiver's
ability to receive an OTA wanted signal at its assigned channel
frequency in the presence of an OTA adjacent channel signal with a
specified centre frequency offset of the interfering signal to the band
edge of a victim system.

#### 10.5.1.2 Minimum requirement for *IAB-DU type 1-O*

Minimum requirement is the same as specified for BS type 1-O in
TS38.104\[2\], subclause 10.5.1.2.

#### 10.5.1.3 Minimum requirement for *IAB-DU type 2-O*

Minimum requirement is the same as specified for BS type 2-O in
TS38.104\[2\], subclause 10.5.1.3.

#### 10.5.1.4 Minimum requirement for *IAB-MT type 2-O*

The requirement shall apply at the RIB when the AoA of the incident wave
of a received signal and the interfering signal are from the same
direction and are within the *OTA REFSENS RoAoA.*

The wanted and interfering signals apply to all supported polarizations,
under the assumption o*f polarization match*.

The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference
measurement channel.

For FR2, the OTA wanted and the interfering signal are specified in
table 10.5.1.4-1 and table 10.5.1.4-2 for ACS. The reference measurement
channel for the OTA wanted signal is further specified in annex A.1. The
characteristics of the interfering signal is further specified in annex
F.

The OTA ACS requirement is applicable outside the *IAB-MT RF Bandwidth*.
The OTA interfering signal offset is defined relative to the *IAB-MT RF
Bandwidth edges*.

For Wide Area IAB-MT, for RIBs supporting operation in *non-contiguous
spectrum* within any *operating band*, the OTA ACS requirement shall
apply in addition inside any sub-block gap, in case the sub-block gap
size is at least as wide as the NR interfering signal in table
10.5.1.4-2. The OTA interfering signal offset is defined relative to the
sub-block edges inside the sub-block gap.

#### 10.5.1.5 Minimum requirement for *IAB-MT type 1-O*

The requirement shall apply at the RIB when the AoA of the incident wave
of a received signal and the interfering signal are from the same
direction and are within the *minSENS RoAoA*.

The wanted and interfering signals apply to each supported polarization,
under the assumption o*f polarization match*.

The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference
measurement channel.

For FR1, the OTA wanted and the interfering signal are specified in
table 10.5.1.5-1, table 10.5.1.5-2 and table 10.5.1.5-3 for OTA ACS. The
reference measurement channel for the OTA wanted signal is further
specified in annex A.1. The characteristics of the interfering signal is
further specified in annex F.

The OTA ACS requirement is applicable outside the *IAB-MT RF Bandwidth*
or *Radio Bandwidth*. The OTA interfering signal offset is defined
relative to the *IAB-MT RF Bandwidth edges* or *Radio Bandwidth edges*.

For RIBs supporting operation in *non-contiguous spectrum* within any
*operating band*, the OTA ACS requirement shall apply in addition inside
any *sub-block gap*, in case the *sub-block gap* size is at least as
wide as the NR interfering signal in table 10.5.1.5-2 and table table
10.5.1.5-3. The OTA interfering signal offset is defined relative to the
*sub-block* edges inside the *sub-block gap*.

For *multi-band RIBs*, the OTA ACS requirement shall apply in addition
inside any *Inter RF Bandwidth gap*, in case the *Inter RF Bandwidth
gap* size is at least as wide as the NR interfering signal in table
10.5.1.5-2 and table 10.5.1.5-3. The interfering signal offset is
defined relative to the *IAB-MT RF Bandwidth* edges inside the *Inter RF
Bandwidth gap*.

### 10.5.2 OTA in-band blocking

10.5.2.1 General

The OTA in-band blocking characteristics is a measure of the receiver's
ability to receive a OTA wanted signal at its assigned channel in the
presence of an unwanted OTA interferer, which is an NR signal for
general blocking or an NR signal with one RB for narrowband blocking.

10.5.2.2 Minimum requirement for *IAB-DU type 1-O*

Minimum requirement is the same as specified for BS type 1-O in
TS38.104\[2\], subclause 10.5.2.2.

10.5.2.3 Minimum requirement for *IAB DU type 2-O*

Minimum requirement is the same as specified for BS type 2-O in
TS38.104\[2\], subclause 10.5.2.3.

10.5.2.4 Minimum requirement for *IAB-MT of type 2-O*

The requirement shall apply at the RIB when the AoA of the incident wave
of a received signal and the interfering signal are from the same
direction and are within the *OTA REFSENS RoAoA.*

The wanted and interfering signals apply to each supported polarization,
under the assumption o*f polarization match*.

The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference
measurement channel.

For Wide Area *IAB-MT type 2-O*, the OTA wanted and OTA interfering
signals are provided at RIB using the parameters in table 10.5.2.4-1 for
general OTA blocking requirements. The reference measurement channel for
the wanted signal is further specified in annex A.1. The characteristics
of the interfering signal is further specified in annex F.

The OTA blocking requirements are applicable outside the IAB-MT RF
Bandwidth. The interfering signal offset is defined relative to the
*IAB-MT RF Bandwidth edges*.

For Wide Area *IAB-MT type 2-O* the OTA in-band blocking requirement
shall apply from F~DL\_low~ - Δf~OOB~ to F~DL\_high~ + Δf~OOB~*.* The
Δf~OOB~ for *IAB-MT type 2-O* is defined in table 10.5.2.4-0.

Table 10.5.2.4-0: Δf~OOB~ offset for NR *operating bands for Wide Area
IAB-MT in FR2*

  IAB-MT type         *Operating band* characteristics       Δf~OOB~ (MHz)
  ------------------- -------------------------------------- ---------------
  *IAB-MT type 2-O*   F~DL\_high~ -- F~DL\_low~ ≤ 3250 MHz   1500

For Wide Area IAB-MT and for a RIBs supporting operation in
*non-contiguous spectrum* within any *operating band*, the OTA blocking
requirements apply in addition inside any sub-block gap, in case the
sub-block gap size is at least as wide as twice the interfering signal
minimum offset in table 10.5.2.4-1. The interfering signal offset is
defined relative to the sub-block edges inside the sub-block gap.

10.5.2.5 Minimum requirement for *IAB-MT of type 1-O*

The requirement shall apply at the RIB when the AoA of the incident wave
of a received signal and the interfering signal are from the same
direction, and:

\- when the wanted signal is based on EIS~REFSENS~: the AoA of the
incident wave of a received signal and the interfering signal are within
the *OTA REFSENS RoAoA.*

\- when the wanted signal is based on EIS~minSENS~: the AoA of the
incident wave of a received signal and the interfering signal are within
the *minSENS RoAoA*.

The wanted and interfering signals apply to each supported polarization,
under the assumption of *polarization match*.

The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference
measurement channel, with OTA wanted and OTA interfering signal
specified in tables 10.5.2.5-1, table 10.5.2.5-2 and table 10.5.2.5-3
for general OTA and narrowband OTA blocking requirements. The reference
measurement channel for the OTA wanted signal is identified in clause
10.3.3 and are further specified in annex A.1. The characteristics of
the interfering signal is further specified in annex F.

The OTA in-band blocking requirements apply outside the *IAB-MT RF
Bandwidth* or *Radio Bandwidth*. The interfering signal offset is
defined relative to the *IAB-MT RF Bandwidth edges* or *Radio Bandwidth*
edges.

For *IAB-MT type 1-O* the OTA in-band blocking requirement shall apply
in the in-band blocking frequency range, which is from F~DL,low~ -
Δf~OOB~ to F~DL,high~ + Δf~OOB~.*.* The Δf~OOB~ for *wide area IAB-MT
type 1-O* is defined in table 10.5.2.5-0.

Table 10.5.2.5-0: Δf~OOB~ offset for NR *operating bands in FR1*

  IAB-MT type         *Operating band* characteristics              Δf~OOB~ (MHz)
  ------------------- --------------------------------------------- ---------------
  *IAB-MT type 1-O*   F~DL,high~ -- F~DL,low~ \< 100 MHz            20
                      100 MHz ≤ F~DL,high~ -- F~DL,low~ ≤ 900 MHz   60

For RIBs supporting operation in *non-contiguous spectrum* within any
*operating band*, the OTA in-band blocking requirements apply in
addition inside any *sub-block gap*, in case the *sub-block gap* size is
at least as wide as twice the interfering signal minimum offset in table
10.5.2.5-1. The interfering signal offset is defined relative to the
*sub-block* edges inside the *sub-block gap*.

For *multi-band RIBs*, the OTA in-band blocking requirements apply in
the in-band blocking frequency ranges for each supported *operating
band*. The requirement shall apply in addition inside any *Inter RF
Bandwidth gap*, in case the *Inter RF Bandwidth gap* size is at least as
wide as twice the interfering signal minimum offset in tables 10.5.2.5-1
and 10.5.2.5-3.

For a RIBs supporting operation in *non-contiguous spectrum* within any
*operating band*, the OTA narrowband blocking requirements apply in
addition inside any *sub-block gap*, in case the *sub-block gap* size is
at least as wide as the interfering signal minimum offset in table
10.5.2.5-3. The interfering signal offset is defined relative to the
*sub-block* edges inside the *sub-block gap*.

For a *multi-band RIBs*, the OTA narrowband blocking requirements apply
in the narrowband blocking frequency ranges for each supported
*operating band*. The requirement shall apply in addition inside any
*Inter RF Bandwidth gap*, in case the *Inter RF Bandwidth gap* size is
at least as wide as the interfering signal minimum offset in table
10.5.2.5-3.

10.6 OTA out-of-band blocking
-----------------------------

### 10.6.1 General

The OTA out-of-band blocking characteristics are a measure of the
receiver unit ability to receive a wanted signal at the *RIB* at its
assigned channel in the presence of an unwanted interferer.

### 10.6.2 Minimum requirement for IAB-MT type 1-O and IAB-DU type 1-O

The requirement shall apply at the RIB when the AoA of the incident wave
of the received signal and the interfering signal are from the same
direction and are within the *minSENS RoAoA*.

The wanted signal applies to each supported polarization, under the
assumption of *polarization match.* The interferer shall be
*polarization matched* in-band and the polarization maintained for
out-of-band frequencies.

For OTA wanted and OTA interfering signals provided at the RIB using the
parameters in table 10.6.2-2, the following requirements shall be met:

\- The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the
reference measurement channel. The reference measurement channel for the
OTA wanted signal is identified in clause 10.3.2 and subclause 10.3.3
for each *IAB-Node channel bandwidth*.

For a *multi-band RIB*, the OTA out-of-band requirement shall apply for
each supported *operating band*, with the exception that the in-band
blocking frequency ranges of all supported *operating bands* according
to table 10.6.2-1 shall be excluded from the OTA out‑of‑band blocking
requirement.

For OTA out-of-band blocking requirement apply from 30 MHz to F~UL,low~
- Δf~OOB~ and from F~UL,high~ + Δf~OOB~ up to 12750 MHz. The Δf~OOB~ for
FR1 OTA out-of-band blocking requirement is defined in table 10.6.2-1.

### 10.6.3 Minimum requirement for IAB-MT type 2-O and IAB-DU type 2-O

The requirement shall apply at the RIB when the AoA of the incident wave
of the received signal and the interfering signal are from the same
direction and are within the *OTA REFSENS RoAoA*.

The wanted signal applies to each supported polarization, under the
assumption of *polarization match*. The interferer shall be polarization
matched in-band and the polarization maintained for out-of-band
frequencies.

For *IAB type 2-O* the OTA out-of-band blocking requirement apply from
30 MHz to F~UL,low~ -- 1500 MHz and from F~UL,high~ + 1500 MHz up to
2^nd^ harmonic of the upper frequency edge of the *operating band*.

For OTA wanted and OTA interfering signals provided at the RIB using the
parameters in table 10.6.3-1, the following requirements shall be met:

> \- The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the
> reference measurement channel. The reference measurement channel for
> the OTA wanted signal is identified in subclause 10.3.2 and subclause
> 10.3.3 for each *IAB Node channel bandwidth*.

### 10.6.4 Co-location minimum requirement for IAB-MT type 1-O and IAB-DU type 1-O

This additional OTA out-of-band blocking requirement may be applied for
the protection of IAB receivers when NR, E‑UTRA BS, UTRA BS, CDMA BS ,
GSM/EDGE BS or IAB-DU and/or IAB-MT operating in a different frequency
band are co-located with an IAB-Node.

The requirement is a co-location requirement. The interferer power
levels are specified at the *co-location reference antenna* conducted
input. The interfering signal power is specified per supported
polarization.

The requirement is valid over the *minSENS RoAoA*.

For OTA wanted and OTA interfering signal provided at the RIB using the
parameters in table 10.6.4-1, the following requirements shall be met:

\- The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the
reference measurement channel. The reference measurement channel for the
OTA wanted signal is identified in clause 10.3 for each *IAB channel
bandwidth* and further specified in annex A.1. The characteristics of
the interfering signal is further specified in annex F.

For *IAB type 1-O* the OTA blocking requirement for co-location with BS
or IAB-Node in other frequency bands is applied for all *operating
bands* for which co-location protection is provided.

10.7 OTA receiver spurious emissions
------------------------------------

### 10.7.1 General

The OTA RX spurious emission is the power of the emissions radiated from
the antenna array from a receiver unit.

The metric used to capture OTA receiver spurious emissions for IAB-MT
and IAB-DU for *IAB type 1-O* and *IAB type 2-O* is *total radiated
power* (TRP), with the requirement defined at the RIB.

For *IAB-MT type 1-O* manufacturer shall declare *N~RXU,active\ ~*.
*N~RXU,active\ ~* active receiver units supporting the same *operating
band* is implementation dependent.

The number of active receiver units that are considered when calculating
the radiated RX spurious emission limits (N~RXU,counted~) for *IAB-MT
type 1-O* is calculated as follows:

> N~RXU,counted~ = *min(N~RXU,active~ , 8)*

N~RXU,countedpercell~ is used for scaling of *basic limits* and is
derived as N~RXU,countedpercell~ = *N~RXU,counted~.*

NOTE: N~RXU,active~ is the number of actually active receiver units.

### 10.7.2 IAB-DU OTA receiver spurious emissions

#### 10.7.2.1 Minimum requirement for IAB-DU type 1-O

Minimum requirement is the same as specified for BS type 1-O in TS
38.104\[2\], subclause 10.7.2.

#### 10.7.2.2 Minimum requirement for IAB-DU type 2-O

Minimum requirement is the same as specified for BS type 2-O in TS
38.104\[2\], subclause 10.7.3.

### 10.7.3 IAB-MT OTA receiver spurious emissions

#### 10.7.3.1 Minimum requirement for IAB-MT type 1-O

For an IAB-MT operating in TDD, the OTA RX spurious emissions
requirement shall apply during the *transmitter OFF period* only.

For RX only *multi-band RIB*, the OTA RX spurious emissions requirements
are subject to exclusion zones in each supported *operating band*.

The OTA RX spurious emissions requirement for *IAB-MT type 1-O* is that
for each *basic limit* specified in table 10.7.3.1‑1*,* the power sum of
emissions at the RIB shall not exceed limits specified as the *basic
limit* + X, where X = 10log~10~(N~RXU,countedpercell~) dB, unless stated
differently in regional regulation.

10.8 OTA receiver intermodulation
---------------------------------

### 10.8.1 General

### 10.9.1 General

In-channel selectivity (ICS) is a measure of the receiver ability to
receive a wanted signal at its assigned resource block locations in the
presence of an interfering signal received at a larger power spectral
density. In this condition a throughput requirement shall be met for a
specified reference measurement channel. The interfering signal shall be
an NR signal as specified in annex \[A.1\] and shall be time aligned
with the wanted signal

### 10.9.2 Minimum requirement for *IAB-DU* type 1-O

references to *BS channel bandwidth* apply to *IAB-DU channel
bandwidth*.

11 Radiated performance requirements
====================================

11.1 IAB-DU performance requirements
------------------------------------

### 11.1.1 General

Radiated performance requirements specify the ability of the *IAB-DU
type 1-O* or *IAB-DU type 2-O* to correctly demodulate radiated signals
in various conditions and configurations. Radiated performance
requirements are specified at the RIB.

Radiated performance requirements for the IAB-DU are specified for the
fixed reference channels defined in annex A and the propagation
conditions in annex I. The requirements only apply to those FRCs that
are supported by the IAB-DU.

The radiated performance requirements for *IAB-DU type 1-O* and for
*IAB-DU type 2-O* are limited to two OTA *demodulation branches* as
described in clause 11.1.2. Conformance requirements can only be tested
for 1 or 2 *demodulation branches* depending on the number of
polarizations supported by the IAB-DU, with the required SNR applied
separately per polarization.

NOTE 1: The IAB-DU can support more than 2 *demodulation branches*,
however OTA conformance testing can only be performed for 1 or 2
*demodulation branches*.

Unless stated otherwise, radiated performance requirements apply for a
single carrier only. Radiated performance requirements for a IAB-DU
supporting CA are defined in terms of single carrier requirements.

In tests performed with signal generators a synchronization signal may
be provided from the IAB-DU to the signal generator, to enable correct
timing of the wanted signal.

Whenever the \"RX antennas\" term is used for the radiated performance
requirements description, it shall refer to the *demodulation branches*
(i.e. not physical antennas of the antenna array).

The SNR used in this clause is specified based on a single carrier and
defined as:

SNR = S / N

Where:

S is the total signal energy in a slot on a RIB.

N is the noise energy in a bandwidth corresponding to the *transmission
bandwidth* over the duration of a slot on a RIB.

### 11.1.2 OTA demodulation branches

Radiated performance requirements are only specified for up to 2
*demodulation branches*.

If the *IAB-DU type 1-O*, or the *IAB-DU type 2-O* uses polarization
diversity and has the ability to maintain isolation between the signals
for each of the *demodulation branches*, then radiated performance
requirements can be tested for up to two *demodulation branches* (i.e.
1RX or 2RX test setups). When tested for two *demodulation branches*,
each demodulation branch maps to one polarization.

If the *IAB-DU type 1-O*, or the *IAB-DU type 2-O* does not use
polarization diversity then radiated performance requirements can only
be tested for a single *demodulation branch* (i.e. 1RX test setup).

### 11.1.2 Performance requirements for PUSCH

#### 11.1.2.1 Performance requirements for *IAB type 1-O*

##### 11.1.2.1.1 Performance requirements for PUSCH with transform precoding disabled

Apply the requirements defined in clause 8.1.2.1 for 2Rx.

##### 11.1.2.1.2 Performance requirmements for PUSCH with transform precoding enabled

Apply the requirements defined in clause 8.1.2.2 for 2Rx.

##### 11.1.2.1.3 Performance requirements for UCI multiplexed on PUSCH

Apply the requirements defined in clause 8.1.2.3 for 2Rx.

#### 11.1.2.2 Performance requirements for IAB type 2-O

##### 11.1.2.2.1 Performance requirmements for PUSCH with transform precoding disabled

##### 11.1.2.2.1.1 General {#general-85 .H6}

The performance requirement of PUSCH is determined by a minimum required
throughput for a given SNR. The required throughput is expressed as a
fraction of the maximum throughput for the FRCs listed in annex A. The
performance requirements assume HARQ retransmissions.

##### 11.1.2.2.2 Performance requirmements for PUSCH with transform precoding enabled

##### 11.1.2.2.2.1 General {#general-86 .H6}

The performance requirement of PUSCH is determined by a minimum required
throughput for a given SNR. The required throughput is expressed as a
fraction of the maximum throughput for the FRCs listed in Annex A. The
performance requirements assume HARQ retransmissions.

##### 11.1.2.2.3 Performance requirements for UCI multiplexed on PUSCH

##### 11.1.2.2.3.1 General {#general-87 .H6}

In the tests for UCI multiplexed on PUSCH the UCI information only
contains CSI part 1 and CSI part 2 information and there is no HACK/ACK
information transmitted.

The CSI part 1 block error probability is defined as the probability of
incorrectly decoded the CSI part 1 information when the CSI part 1
information is sent as follow:

$\text{BLER}_{CSI\ part\ 1} = \ \frac{\#(false\ CSI\ part\ 1)}{\#(CSI\ part\ 1)}$

where:

\- \#(false CSI part 1) denotes the number of incorrectly decoded CSI
part 1 information transmitted occasions

\- \#(CSI part 1) denotes the number of CSI part 1information
transmitted occasions.

The CSI part 2 block error probability (BLER) is defined as the
probability of incorrectly decoded the CSI part 2 information when the
CSI part 2 information is sent as follows:

$\text{BLER}_{CSI\ part\ 2} = \ \frac{\#(false\ CSI\ part\ 2)}{\#(CSI\ part\ 2)}$

where:

\- \#(false CSI part 2) denotes the number of incorrectly decoded CSI
part 2 information transmitted occasions

\- \#(CSI part 2) denotes the number of CSI part 2 information
transmitted occasions.

The number of UCI information bit payload per slot is defined for two
cases as follows:

\- 5 bits in CSI part 1, 2 bits in CSI part 2

\- 20 bits in CSI part 1, 20 bits in CSI part 2

The 7bits UCI case is further defined with the bitmap \[c0 c1 c2 c3 c4\]
= \[0 1 0 1 0\] for CSI part 1 information, where c0 is mapping to the
RI information, and with the bitmap \[c0 c1\] = \[1 0\] for CSI part2
information.

The 40bits UCI information case is assumed random information bit
selection.

In both tests, PUSCH data, CSI part 1 and CSI part 2 information are
transmitted simultaneously.

##### 11.1.3.2.3.1.1 General {#general-89 .H6}

The NACK to ACK detection probability is the probability that an ACK bit
is falsely detected when an NACK bit was sent on the particular bit
position, where the NACK to ACK detection probability is defined as
follows:

![](media/image13.wmf){width="4.2in" height="0.39166666666666666in"}

where:

\- ![](media/image14.wmf){width="1.2in" height="0.2in"} denotes the
total number of NACK bits transmitted

\- ![](media/image15.wmf){width="2.0in" height="0.2in"} denotes the
number of NACK bits decoded as ACK bits at the receiver, i.e. the number
of received ACK bits

\- NACK bits in the definition do not contain the NACK bits which are
mapped from DTX, i.e. NACK bits received when DTX is sent should not be
considered.

Random codeword selection is assumed.

##### 11.1.3.2.6 Performance requirements for PUCCH format 4

##### 11.1.3.2.6.1 General {#general-94 .H6}

The performance is measured by the required SNR at UCI block error
probability not exceeding 1%.

The UCI block error probability is defined as the conditional
probability of incorrectly decoded UCI information when the UCI
information is sent. The UCI information does not contain CSI part 2.

The transient period as specified in TS 38.101-1 \[3\] clause 6.3.3.1 is
not taken into account for performance requirement testing, where the RB
hopping is symmetric to the CC centre, i.e. intra-slot frequency hopping
is enabled.

##### 11.1.4.1.1 PRACH False alarm probability

Apply the requirements defined in clause 8.1.4.1 for 2Rx.

##### 11.1.4.1.2 PRACH detection requirements

Apply the requirements defined in clause 8.1.4.2 for 2Rx.

#### 11.1.4.2 Performance requirements for *IAB type 2-O*

##### 11.1.4.2.1 PRACH false alarm probability

##### 11.1.4.2.1.1 General {#general-95 .H6}

The false alarm requirement is valid for any number of receive antennas,
for any channel bandwidth.

The false alarm probability is the conditional total probability of
erroneous detection of the preamble (i.e. erroneous detection from any
detector) when input is only noise.

##### 11.1.4.2.1.2 Minimum requirement {#minimum-requirement-6 .H6}

The false alarm probability shall be less than or equal to 0.1%.

##### 11.1.4.2.2 PRACH missed detection requirements

##### 11.1.4.2.2.1 General {#general-96 .H6}

The probability of detection is the conditional probability of correct
detection of the preamble when the signal is present. There are several
error cases -- detecting different preamble than the one that was sent,
not detecting a preamble at all or correct preamble detection but with
the wrong timing estimation. For AWGN and TDLA30-300, a timing
estimation error occurs if the estimation error of the timing of the
strongest path is larger than the time error tolerance given in Table
11.1.4.2.2.1-1.

The test preambles for normal mode are listed in table A.2.5-2 and the
test parameter *msg1-FrequencyStart* is set to 0.

##### 11.1.4.2.2.2 Minimum requirements {#minimum-requirements-23 .H6}

11.2 IAB-MT performance requirements
------------------------------------

### 11.2.1 General

Radiated performance requirements specify the ability of the *IAB-MT
type 1-O* or the *IAB-MT type 2-O* to correctly demodulate radiated
signals in various conditions and configurations. Radiated performance
requirements are specified at the RIB.

Radiated performance requirements for the IAB-MT are specified for the
fixed reference channels defined in annex A and the propagation
conditions in annex I. The requirements only apply to those FRCs that
are supported by the IAB-MT.

The radiated performance requirements for the *IAB-MT type 1-O* and for
the *IAB-MT type 2-O* are limited to two OTA *demodulation branches* as
described in clause 11.2.2. Conformance requirements can only be tested
for 1 or 2 *demodulation branches* depending on the number of
polarizations supported by the IAB-MT, with the required SNR applied
separately per polarization.

NOTE 1: The IAB-MT can support more than 2 *demodulation branches*,
however OTA conformance testing can only be performed for 1 or 2
*demodulation branches*.

Unless stated otherwise, radiated performance requirements apply for a
single carrier only.

Whenever the \"RX antennas\" term is used for the radiated performance
requirements description, it shall refer to the *demodulation branches*
(i.e. not physical antennas of the antenna array).

The SNR used in this clause is specified based on a single carrier and
defined as:

SNR = S / N

Where:

S is the total signal energy in a slot on a RIB.

N is the noise energy in a bandwidth corresponding to the *transmission
bandwidth* over the duration of a slot on a RIB

Radiated performance requirements are only specified for up to 2
*demodulation branches*.

### 11.2.2 OTA demodulation branches

If the *IAB-MT type 1-O*, or the *IAB-MT type 2-O* uses polarization
diversity and has the ability to maintain isolation between the signals
for each of the *demodulation branches*, then radiated performance
requirements can be tested for up to two *demodulation branches* (i.e.
1RX or 2RX test setups). When tested for two *demodulation branches*,
each demodulation branch maps to one polarization.

If the *IAB-MT type 1-O*, or the *IAB-MT type 2-O* does not use
polarization diversity then radiated performance requirements can only
be tested for a single *demodulation branch* (i.e. 1RX test setup).

### 11.2.2 Demodulation performance requirements

#### 11.2.2.1 Performance requireements for IAB type 1-O

##### 11.2.2.1.1 Performance requirements for PDSCH

##### 11.2.2.1.1.1 General {#general-98 .H6}

The performance requirement of PDSCH is determined by a minimum required
throughput for a given SNR. The required throughput is expressed as a
fraction of maximum throughput for the FRCs listed in annex A. The
performance requirements assume HARQ retransmissions.

The reporting accuracy of the channel quality indicator (CQI) under
frequency non-selective conditions is determined by the reporting
variance and the BLER performance using the transport format indicated
by the reported CQI median. The purpose is to verify that the reported
CQI values are in accordance with the CQI definition given in TS 38.214
\[11\]. To account for sensitivity of the input SNR the reporting
definition is considered to be verified if the reporting accuracy is met
for at least one of two SNR levels separated by an offset of 1 dB.

##### 11.2.3.2.2.2 Minimum requirements {#minimum-requirements-28 .H6}

For the parameters specified in Table 11.2.3.2.1.1-1, and using the
downlink physical channels specified in Annex A, the minimum
requirements are specified by the following:

> a\) The reported CQI value according to the reference channel shall be
> in the range of ±1 of the reported median more than 90% of the time.
>
> b\) If the PDSCH BLER using the transport format indicated by median
> CQI is less than or equal to 0.1, then the BLER using the transport
> format indicated by the (median CQI+1) shall be greater than 0.1. If
> the PDSCH BLER using the transport format indicated by the median CQI
> is greater than 0.1, then the BLER using transport format indicated by
> (median CQI-1) shall be less than or equal to 0.1.

##### 11.2.3.2.3 Reporting of Precoding Matrix Indicator (PMI)

##### 11.2.3.2.3.1 General {#general-104 .H6}

The minimum performance requirements of PMI reporting are defined based
on the precoding gain, expressed as the relative increase in throughput
when the transmitter is configured according to the IAB-MT reports
compared to the case when the transmitter is using random precoding,
respectively. When the transmitter uses random precoding, for each PDSCH
allocation a precoder is randomly generated and applied to the PDSCH. A
fixed transport format (FRC) is configured for all requirements.

The requirements for transmission mode 1 with 2TX and higher layer
parameter *codebookType* set to \'typeI-SinglePanel\' are specified in
terms of the ratio

![](media/image22.wmf){width="0.675in" height="0.49166666666666664in"}

In the definition of *γ*, for 2TX PMI requirements,
![](media/image23.wmf){width="0.2in" height="0.25833333333333336in"}is
90 % of the maximum throughput obtained at
![](media/image24.wmf){width="0.425in" height="0.25833333333333336in"}
using the precoders configured according to the IAB-MT reports, and
![](media/image25.wmf){width="0.25833333333333336in"
height="0.25833333333333336in"}is the throughput measured at
![](media/image24.wmf){width="0.425in"
height="0.25833333333333336in"}with random precoding.

##### 11.2.3.2.4 Reporting of Rank Indicator (RI)

##### 11.2.3.2.4.1 General {#general-105 .H6}

The purpose of this test is to verify that the reported rank indicator
accurately represents the channel rank. The accuracy of RI reporting is
determined by the relative increase of the throughput obtained when
transmitting based on the reported rank compared to the case for which a
fixed rank is used for transmission.

The minimum performance requirement in Table 11.2.3.2.4.2-1 is defined
as

a\) The ratio of the throughput obtained when transmitting based on
IAB-MT reported RI and that obtained when transmitting with fixed rank 1
shall be ≥ γ~1~;

b\) The ratio of the throughput obtained when transmitting based on
IAB-MT reported RI and that obtained when transmitting with fixed rank 2
shall be ≥ γ~2~;

12 Radio Resource Management requirements 
=========================================

12.1 RRC\_CONNECTED state mobility for IAB-MTs
----------------------------------------------

### 12.1.1 RRC Connection Mobility Control

#### 12.1.1.1 SA: RRC Re-establishment

##### 12.1.1.1.1 Introduction

This clause contains requirements on the IAB-MT regarding RRC connection
re-establishment procedure. RRC connection re-establishment is initiated
when an IAB-MT in RRC\_CONNECTED state loses RRC connection due to any
of failure cases, including radio link failure, handover failure, and
RRC connection reconfiguration failure. The RRC connection
re-establishment procedure is specified in clause 5.3.7 of TS 38.331
\[15\].

The requirements in this clause are applicable for RRC connection
re-establishment to NR cell.

##### 12.1.1.1.2 Requirements

In RRC\_CONNECTED state the IAB-MT shall be capable of sending
*RRCReestablishmentRequest* message within T~re-establish\_delay~
seconds from the moment it detects a loss in RRC connection. The total
RRC connection delay (T~re-establish\_delay~) shall be less than:

$$T_{re - establish\_ delay} = T_{IAB - MT\_ re - establish\_ delay} + T_{UL\_ grant}$$

T~UL\_grant~: It is the time required to acquire and process uplink
grant from the target PCell. The uplink grant is required to transmit
*RRCReestablishmentRequest* message.

The IAB-MT re-establishment delay (T~IAB-MT\_re-establish\_delay~) is
specified in clause 12.1.1.1.2.1.

###### 12.1.1.1.2.1 IAB MT Re-establishment delay requirement

The IAB-MT re-establishment delay (T~IAB-MT\_re-establish\_delay~) is
the time between the moments when any of the conditions requiring RRC
re-establishment as defined in clause 5.3.7 in TS 38.331 \[15\] is
detected by the IAB-MT and when the IAB-MT sends PRACH to the target
PCell. The IAB-MT re-establishment delay
(T~IAB-MT\_re-establish\_delay~) requirement shall be less than:

$$T_{IAB - MT\_ re - establish\_ delay} = 400\ \text{ms} + T_{identify\_ intra\_ NR} + \sum_{i = 1}^{N_{\text{freq}} - 1}T_{identify\_ inter\_ NR,i} + T_{SI - NR} + T_{\text{PRACH}}$$

The intra-frequency target NR cell shall be considered detectable if
each relevant SSB can satisfy that:

\- the conditions of SSB\_RP and SSB Ês/Iot according to Annex H.1.1.1
for a corresponding IAB-MT class and IAB type are fulfilled.

The inter-frequency target NR cell shall be considered detectable when
for each relevant SSB:

\- the conditions of SSB\_RP and SSB Ês/Iot according to Annex H.1.1.2
for a corresponding IAB-MT class and IAB type are fulfilled.

T~identify\_intra\_NR~: It is the time to identify the target
intra-frequency NR cell and it depends on whether the target NR cell is
known cell or unknown cell and on the frequency range (FR) of the target
NR cell. If the IAB-MT is not configured with intra-frequency NR carrier
for RRC re-establishment then T~identify\_intra\_NR~=0; otherwise
T~identify\_intra\_NR~ shall not exceed the values defined in Table
12.1.1.1.2.1-1.

T~identify\_inter\_NR,i~: It is the time to identify the target
inter-frequency NR cell on inter-frequency carrier *i* configured for
RRC re-establishment and it depends on whether the target NR cell is
known cell or unknown cell and on the frequency range (FR) of the target
NR cell. T~identify\_inter\_NR,i~ shall not exceed the values defined in
Table 12.1.1.1.2.1-2.

T~SMTC~: It is the periodicity of the SMTC occasion configured for the
intra-frequency carrier. If the IAB-MT has been provided with higher
layer signaling of *smtc2 \[15\]* and is not capable of 4 SMTC
configurations per frequency \[15\], then T~SMTC~ follows *smtc1* or
*smtc2* according to the physical cell ID of the target cell. If the
IAB-MT has been provided with higher layer signaling of *smtcj*, where
1≤*j*≤4 \[15\] and is also capable of 4 SMTC configurations per
frequency \[15\], then T~SMTC~ follows *smtcj* according to the physical
cell ID of the target cell.

T~SMTC,i~: It is the periodicity of the SMTC occasion configured for the
inter-frequency carrier *i*. If the IAB-MT is not capable of 4 SMTC
configurations per frequency \[15\], then the requirements shall apply
provided that the IAB-MT is configured with only one SMTC configuration
for each inter-frequency carrier *i* according to the physical cell ID
of the target cell. If the IAB-MT has been provided with higher layer
signaling of *smtcj*, where 1≤*j*≤4 \[15\] and is also capable of 4 SMTC
configurations per frequency \[15\], then T~SMTC~ follows *smtcj*
configured for the inter-frequency carrier *i* according to the physical
cell ID of the target cell. If the IAB-MT is not provided with SMTC
configuration then the IAB-MT may assume that the target SSB periodicity
is no larger than 160 ms.

T~SI-NR~: It is the time required for receiving all the relevant system
information according to the reception procedure and the RRC procedure
delay of system information blocks defined in TS 38.331 \[15\] for the
target NR cell.

T~PRACH:~ It is the delay uncertainty in acquiring the first available
PRACH occasion in the target NR cell. T~PRACH~ can be up to the
summation of SSB to PRACH occasion association period and 10 ms. SSB to
PRACH occasion associated period is defined in clause 14 of TS 38.213
\[10\].

*N~freq~*: It is the total number of NR frequencies to be monitored for
RRC re-establishment; N~freq~ = 1 if the target intra-frequency NR cell
is known, else N~freq~ = 2 and T~identify\_intra\_NR~ = 0 if the target
inter-frequency NR cell is known.

There is no requirement if the target cell does not contain the IAB-MT
context or if the SSB transmission periodicity is larger than 160 ms.

In the requirement defined in the below tables, the target FR1 cell is
known if it has been meeting the relevant cell identification
requirement during the last 5 seconds otherwise it is unknown.

#### 12.1.1.2 Random access

The requirements in clause 6.2.2 in TS 38.133 \[6\] apply for IAB-MT.

#### 12.1.1.3 SA: RRC Connection Release with Redirection

##### 12.1.1.3.1 Introduction

This clause contains requirements on the IAB-MT regarding RRC connection
release with redirection procedure. RRC connection release with
redirection is initiated by the *RRCRelease* message with redirection to
NR from NR specified in TS 38.331 \[15\]. The RRC connection release
with redirection procedure is specified in clause 5.3.8 of TS 38.331
\[15\].

##### 12.1.1.3.2 Requirements

###### 12.1.1.3.2.1 RRC connection release with redirection to NR

The IAB-MT shall be capable of performing the RRC connection release
with redirection to the target NR cell within
T~connection\_release\_redirect\_NR~.

The time delay (T~connection\_release\_redirect\_NR~) is the time
between the end of the last slot containing the RRC command,
"*RRCRelease*" (TS 38.331 \[15\]) on the NR PDSCH and the time the
IAB-MT starts to send random access to the target NR cell. The time
delay (T~connection\_release\_redirect\_NR~) shall be less than:

T~connection\_release\_redirect\_NR~ = T~RRC\_procedure\_delay~ +
T~identify-NR~ + T~SI-NR~ + T~RACH~

The target NR cell shall be considered detetable when for each relevant
SSB, the side conditions should be met that,

\- the conditions of SSB\_RP and SSB Ês/Iot according to Annex H.1.1.3
for a corresponding IAB-MT class and IAB type are fulfilled.

T~RRC\_procedure\_delay~: It is the RRC procedure delay for processing
the received message "*RRCRelease*" as defined in clause 6.2.2 of TS
38.331 \[15\].

T~identify-NR~: It is the time to identify the target NR cell and
depends on the frequency range (FR) of the target NR cell. It is defined
in Table 12.1.1.3.2-1. Note that T~identify-NR~ = T~PSS/SSS-sync~ +
T~meas~, in which T~PSS/SSS-sync~ is the cell search time and T~meas~ is
the measurement time due to cell selection criteria evaluation.

T~SI-NR~: It is the time required for acquiring all the relevant system
information of the target NR cell. This time depends upon whether the
IAB-MT is provided with the relevant system information of the target NR
cell or not by the old NR cell before the RRC connection is released.

T~RACH:~ It is the delay uncertainty in acquiring the first available
PRACH occasion in the target NR cell. T~RACH~ can be up to the summation
of SSB to PRACH occasion association period and 10 ms. SSB to PRACH
occasion associated period is defined in clause 14 of TS 38.213 \[10\].

T~rs~ is the SMTC periodicity of the target NR cell if the IAB-MT has
been provided with an SMTC configuration for the target cell in the
redirection command, otherwise T~rs~ is the SMTC periodicity configured
in the *measObjectNR* having the same SSB frequency and subcarrier
spacing configured for the RRC connection release with redirection. If
the IAB-MT is not capable of 4 SMTC configurations per frequency \[15\],
then the requirements shall apply provided that the IAB-MT is configured
with only one SMTC configuration on carrier configured configured for
RRC connection release with redirection. If the IAB-MT has been provided
with higher layer signaling of *smtcj*, where 1≤*j*≤4 \[15\] and is also
capable of 4 SMTC configurations per frequency \[15\], then T~smtc~
follows *smtcj* according to the physical cell ID of the target cell. If
the IAB-MT is not provided with SMTC configuration or measurement object
for the frequency which is also configured for the RRC connection
release with redirection then the requirement in this clause is applied
with T~rs~ = 160 ms if the SSB transmission periodicity is not larger
than 160 ms.

\- There is no requirement if the SSB transmission periodicity is larger
than 160ms.

12.2 Timing
-----------

### 12.2.1 IAB-MT transmit timing

#### 12.2.1.1 Introduction

The IAB-MT shall have capability to follow the frame timing change of
the reference cell in connected state. The uplink frame transmission
takes place before the reception of the first detected path (in time) of
the corresponding downlink frame from the reference cell. IAB-MT
belonging to local area IAB-MT class as defined in clause 4.4.2 and also
capable of carrier aggregation shall use the SpCell as the reference
cell for deriving the IAB-MT transmit timing for cells in the PTAG.
IAB-MT initial transmit timing accuracy, gradual timing adjustment
requirements are defined in the following requirements.

#### 12.2.1.2 Requirements

The IAB-MT initial transmission timing error shall be less than or equal
to ±T~e~ where the timing error limit value T~e~ is specified in Table
12.2.1.2-1. This requirement applies for PUCCH, PUSCH and SRS or it is
the PRACH transmission.

The IAB-MT shall meet the Te requirement for an initial transmission
provided that at least one SSB is available at the IAB-MT during the
last 160 ms. The reference point for the IAB-MT initial transmit timing
control requirement shall be the downlink timing of the reference cell
minus ![](media/image27.wmf){width="1.2527777777777778in"
height="0.20555555555555555in"}. The downlink timing is defined as the
time when the first detected path (in time) of the corresponding
downlink frame is received from the reference cell. *N*~TA~ for PRACH is
defined as 0.

![](media/image27.wmf){width="1.2527777777777778in"
height="0.20555555555555555in"} (in *T~c~* units) for other channels is
the difference between IAB-MT transmission timing and the downlink
timing immediately after when the last timing advance in clause 12.2.2
was applied. *N*~TA~ for other channels is not changed until next timing
advance is received. The value
of![](media/image28.wmf){width="0.5472222222222223in"
height="0.20555555555555555in"}depends on the duplex mode of the cell in
which the uplink transmission takes place and the frequency range (FR).
![](media/image28.wmf){width="0.5472222222222223in"
height="0.20555555555555555in"}is defined in Table 12.2.1.2-2.

When it is the transmission for PUCCH, PUSCH and SRS transmission, the
IAB-MT shall be capable of changing the transmission timing according to
the received downlink frame of the reference cell except when the timing
advance in clause 12.2.3 is applied.

##### 12.2.1.2.1 Gradual timing adjustment

When the transmission timing error between the IAB-MT and the reference
timing exceeds ±T~e~ then the IAB-MT is required to adjust its timing to
within ±T~e~. The reference timing shall be
![](media/image29.wmf){width="1.2527777777777778in"
height="0.20555555555555555in"} before the downlink timing of the
reference cell. All adjustments made to the IAB-MT uplink timing shall
follow these rules:

1\) The maximum amount of the magnitude of the timing change in one
adjustment shall be T~q~.

2\) The minimum aggregate adjustment rate shall be T~p~ per second.

3\) The maximum aggregate adjustment rate shall be T~q~ per 200 ms.

where the maximum autonomous time adjustment step T~q~ and the aggregate
adjustment rate T~p~ are specified in Table 12.2.1.2.1-1.

IAB-MT shall be able to evaluate whether the downlink radio link quality
on the configured RLM-RS resource estimated over the last
T~Evaluate\_out\_SSB~ \[ms\] period becomes worse than the threshold
Q~out\_SSB~ within T~Evaluate\_out\_SSB~ \[ms\] evaluation period.

T~Evaluate\_out\_SSB~ and T~Evaluate\_in\_SSB~ are defined in Table
12.3.1.2.2-1 for FR1 with scaling factor K~1~ = 5.

T~Evaluate\_out\_SSB~ and T~Evaluate\_in\_SSB~ are defined in Table

For FR1,

\- P = 1

> \- P=1, when the RLM-RS resource is not overlapped with SMTC occasion.

\- $P = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{T_{\text{SSB}}}{T_{\text{SMTCperiod}}}}$,

(T~SSB~ \< T~SMTCperiod~).

\- P = 3, when RLM-RS resource is fully overlapped with SMTC period
(T~SSB~ = T~SMTCperiod~).

If the IAB-MT is not capable of 4 SMTC configurations per frequency
\[15\], and is provided with higher layer signaling of smtcj, where
1≤*j*≤2 \[15\], then T~SMTCperiod~ follows smtcj~max~ where j~max~ is
the maximum value of all j for which smtcj has been configured.

If the IAB-MT is capable of 4 SMTC configurations per frequency \[15\],
and is provided with higher layer signaling of smtcj, where 1≤*j*≤4
\[15\], then T~SMTCperiod~ follows smtcj~max~ where j~max~ is the
maximum value of all j for which smtcj has been configured.

Longer evaluation period would be expected if the combination of RLM-RS
resource and SMTC occasion configurations does not meet previous
conditions.

\- P = 3, when candidate beam detection RS is fully overlapped with SMTC
occasion (T~CSI-RS~ = T~SMTCperiod~).

If the IAB-MT is not capable of 4 SMTC configurations per frequency
\[15\], and is provided with higher layer signaling of smtcj, where
1≤*j*≤2 \[15\], then T~SMTCperiod~ follows smtcj~max~ where j~max~ is
the maximum value of all j for which smtcj has been configured.

If the IAB-MT is capable of 4 SMTC configurations per frequency \[15\],
and is provided with higher layer signaling of smtcj, where 1≤*j*≤4
\[15\], then T~SMTCperiod~ follows smtcj~max~ where j~max~ is the
maximum value of all j for which smtcj has been configured.

Longer evaluation period would be expected if the CSI-RS is on the same
OFDM symbols with RLM, BFD, BM-RS, or other CBD-RS, according to the
measurement restrictions defined in clause 12.3.2.6.3.

The values of M~CBD~ used in Table 12.3.2.6.2-1 and Table 12.3.2.6.2-2
are defined as

\- M~CBD~ = 3, if the CSI-RS resource configured in the set
![](media/image32.wmf){width="0.14583333333333334in" height="0.21875in"}
is transmitted with Density = 3 and over the bandwidth ≥ 24 PRBs.

measured for IAB-MT.

Or

D.6 Estimation of TX chain amplitude and frequency response parameters
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The Annex B.6 in TS 38.104 \[2\] applies to FR1 IAB-MT.

D.7 Averaged EVM
----------------

EVM is averaged over all allocated uplink resource blocks with the
considered modulation scheme in the frequency domain, and a minimum of
$N_{\text{ul}}$ slots where $N_{\text{ul}}$ is the number of slots in a
10 ms measurement interval.

For TDD, let $N_{\text{ul}}^{\text{TDD}}$ be the number of slots with
uplink symbols within a 10 ms measurement interval, the averaging in the
time domain can be calculated from $N_{\text{ul}}^{\text{TDD}}$ slots of
different 10 ms measurement intervals and should have a minimum of
$N_{\text{ul}}\ $slots averaging length where $N_{\text{ul}}\ $is the
number of slots in a 10 ms measurement interval.

*-* ${\overline{\text{EVM}}}_{\text{frame}}$ is derived by: Square the
EVM results in each 10 ms measurement interval. Sum the squares, divide
the sum by the number of EVM relevant locations, square-root the
quotient (RMS).

$${\overline{\text{EVM}}}_{\text{frame}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{\sum_{i = 1}^{N_{\text{ul}}^{\text{TDD}}}N_{i}}\sum_{i = 1}^{N_{\text{ul}}^{\text{TDD}}}{\sum_{j = 1}^{N_{i}}\text{EVM}_{i,j}^{2}}}$$

*- Where* $N_{i}$ is the number of resource blocks with the considered
modulation scheme in slot *i*.

*-* The $\text{EVM}_{\text{frame}}$ is calculated, using the maximum of
${\overline{\text{EVM}}}_{\text{frame}}$ at the window *W* extremities.
Thus ${\overline{\text{EVM}}}_{\text{frame,l}}$ is calculated using
$\widetilde{t} = \mathrm{\Delta}{\widetilde{t}}_{l}$ and
${\overline{\text{EVM}}}_{\text{frame,h}}$ is calculated using
$\widetilde{t} = \mathrm{\Delta}{\widetilde{t}}_{h}$ (*l* and *h*, low
and high; where low is the timing
$\left( \mathrm{\Delta}c - W/2 \right)$ and and high is the timing
$\left( \mathrm{\Delta}c + W/2 \right)$).

$$\text{EVM}_{\text{frame}} = \max\left( {\overline{\text{EVM}}}_{\text{frame,l}},{\overline{\text{EVM}}}_{\text{frame,h}} \right)$$

*-* In order to unite at least $N_{\text{ul}}$ slots, consider the
minimum integer number of 10 ms measurement intervals, where
$N_{\text{frame}}$ is determined by.

$$N_{\text{frame}} = \left\lceil \frac{10 \times N_{\text{slot}}}{N_{\text{ul}}^{\text{TDD}}} \right\rceil$$

and $N_{\text{slot}} = 1$ for 15 kHz SCS, $N_{\text{slot}} = 2$ for 30
kHz SCS and $N_{\text{slot}} = 4$ for 60 kHz SCS normal CP.

*-* Unite by RMS.

### G.1.2 OFDMA channel noise generator (OCNG)

#### G.1.2.1 Generic OFDMA Channel Noise Generator (OCNG)

The OCNG pattern is used in a test for modelling allocations of unused
resources in the channel bandwidth to virtual IAB-MTs (which are not
under test). The OCNG pattern comprises PDCCH and PDSCH transmissions to
the virtual IAB-MTs.

### G.1.3 Antenna configurations

#### G.1.3.1 Antenna configurations for FR1

Unless otherwise specified, NR TDD cells in all RRM Test cases in AWGN
propagation condition are configured with **Antenna Configuration
\[1x2\]**.

##### G.1.3.1.1 Antenna connection for 4 Rx capable IAB-MT

##### G.1.3.1.1.1 Introduction {#g.1.3.1.1.1-introduction .H6}

All tests for FR1 are specified for IAB-MTs supporting 2RX. In this
clause, the antenna connection method for applying 2RX tests to IAB-MTs
supporting 4RX antenna ports is specified. No tests are currently
specified for FR1 which are applicable only to 4RX antenna ports, so 4RX
capable IAB-MTs are always tested by reusing tests which were originally
specified for 2RX IAB-MTs.

##### G.1.3.1.1.2 Principle of testing {#g.1.3.1.1.2-principle-of-testing .H6}

##### G.1.3.1.1.2.1 Single carrier tests {#g.1.3.1.1.2.1-single-carrier-tests .H6}

For 4RX capable IAB-MTs supporting at least one 2RX band, the, all
single carrier tests specified for FR1 except those in G.2.3 shall be
tested on any band where 2RX is supported with the antenna connection
specified in clause G.1.3.1.1.2.2.

For 4RX capable IAB-MT which do not support any 2RX band, all tests
specified for FR1 shall be tested using the antenna connection specified
in clause G.1.3.1.1.2.3. For radio link monitoring tests, the SNR levels
are modified according to table G.1.3.1.1.2.1-1 and table
G.1.3.1.1.2.1-2. For beam failure detection and link recovery tests, the
SNR levels are modified according to table G.1.3.1.1.2.1-3.

##### G.1.3.1.1.2.2 Antenna connection for bands where 2RX is supported {#g.1.3.1.1.2.2-antenna-connection-for-bands-where-2rx-is-supported .H6}

For bands where 2RX is supported, it is left to declaration and AP
configuration to decide which 2 of the 4 Rx ports are connected with
data source from tester. The remaining 2 Rx ports shall be connected
with zero input**.** No test parameters or requirements are modified.

##### G.1.3.1.1.2.3 Antenna connection for bands where 4RX is supported {#g.1.3.1.1.2.3-antenna-connection-for-bands-where-4rx-is-supported .H6}

For bands where 4RX is supported, all 4 RX antennas are connected with
data source from tester**.** The Tester provide independent noise and
fading (low correlation) for each antenna port. Except for the
modifications to radio link monitoring thresholds described in clauses
G.1.3.1.1.2.1 and G.1.3.1.1.2.2, no test parameters or requirements are
modified.

#### G.1.3.2 Antenna configurations for FR2

Unless otherwise specified, the default Downlink **Antenna Configuration
for NR FR2 cells is 1x2.**

In case of Downlink **Antenna Configuration 2x2 for NR FR2 cells, unless
otherwise specified,** the downlink signal is transmitted over the two
polarizations (V and H) of the dual polarized antenna of the test
equipment.

### G.1.4 BWP configurations

#### G.1.4.1 Introduction

This clause provides the typical BWP configurations used for RRM test
cases defined in Annex G. For downlink BWP, both initial BWP and
dedicated BWP configurations are specified in clause G.1.4.2 and for
uplink BWP, both initial BWP and dedicated BWP configurations are
specified in clause G.1.4.3.

### G.1.8 Angle of Arrival (AoA) for FR2 RRM test cases

This clause specifies the AoA setups for FR2 RRM test cases. The
applicable AoA setup is defined in each test case.

#### G.1.8.1 Setup 1: Single AoA 

There is only one active probe in the test. The DL signals, and noise if
applicable, transmitted from the probe, are aligned to AoA based upon
the declaration.

#### G.1.8.2 Setup 2: 2 AoAs

There are 2 active probes in the test. The DL signals, and noise if
applicable, transmitted from the two active probes, align to AoAs based
upon the declaration.

### G.1.9 TCI State Configuration

#### G.1.9.1 Introduction

This clause provides the configurations for TCI states towards either
SSB or CSI-RS. The TCI states defined in this clause are configured in
each test when applicable to indicate that certain DL signals are QCL'ed
with the referenceSignal configured in the TCI states.

### G.2.1 RRC\_CONNECTED state mobility for IAB-MTs

#### G.2.1.1 RRC Connection Mobility Control

##### G.2.1.1.1 RRC Re-establishment

##### G.2.1.1.1.1 Inter-frequency RRC Re-establishment in FR1 for LA IAB-MT {#g.2.1.1.1.1-inter-frequency-rrc-re-establishment-in-fr1-for-la-iab-mt .H6}

##### G.2.1.1.1.1.1 Test Purpose and Environment {#g.2.1.1.1.1.1-test-purpose-and-environment .H6}

The purpose is to verify that the NR inter-frequency RRC
re-establishment delay in FR1 to an unknown target cell is within the
specified limits. These tests will verify the requirements in
clause 12.1.1.1. This test case is applicable only for local area IAB-MT
and for IAB type 1-H.

The test parameters are given in table G.2.1.1.1.1.1-1, table
G.2.1.1.1.1.1-2 and table G.2.1.1.1.1.1-3 below. The test consists of 3
successive time periods, with time duration of T1, T2 and T3
respectively. At the start of time period T2, cell 1, which is the
active cell, becomes inactive. The time period T3 starts after the
occurrence of the radio link failure. During T1, the IAB-MT shall be
configured with the carrier frequency of cell 2 (with RF Channel Number
\#2) to ensure that the IAB-MT has the context of the carrier frequency
of cell 2 by the end of T1.

##### G.2.1.1.1.1.2 Test Requirements {#g.2.1.1.1.1.2-test-requirements .H6}

The RRC re-establishment delay is defined as the time from the start of
time period T3, to the moment when the IAB-MT starts to send PRACH
preambles to cell 2 for sending the *RRCReestablishmentRequest* message
to cell 2.

The RRC re-establishment delay to an unknown NR inter frequency cell
shall be less than 14.5 s.

The rate of correct RRC re-establishments observed during repeated tests
shall be at least 90%.

> NOTE: The RRC re-establishment delay in the test is derived from the
> following expression:

$$T_{re - establish\_ delay} = T_{IAB - MT\_ re - establish\_ delay} + T_{UL\_ grant}$$

> Where:
>
> T~UL\_grant~ = It is the time required to acquire and process uplink
> grant from the target cell. The PRACH reception is used as a trigger
> for the completion of the test; hence T~UL\_grant~ is not used.

$$T_{IAB - MT\_ re - establish\_ delay} = 400\ \text{ms} + T_{identify\_ intra\_ NR} + \sum_{i = 1}^{N_{\text{freq}} - 1}T_{identify\_ inter\_ NR,i} + T_{SI - NR} + T_{\text{PRACH}}$$

> N~freq~ = 2
>
> *T~identify\_intra\_NR~* = 6400 ms
>
> *T~identify\_inter\_NR~* = 6400 ms
>
> T~SI~ *= 1280 ms; it is the* time required for receiving all the
> relevant system information as defined in TS 38.331 for the target
> inter-frequency NR cell.
>
> T~PRACH~ = 15 ms; it is the additional delay caused by the random
> access procedure.
>
> This gives a total of 14495 ms, allow 14.5 s in the test case.

##### G.2.1.1.1.2 Intra-frequency RRC Re-establishment in FR1 without serving cell timing for LA IAB-MT {#g.2.1.1.1.2-intra-frequency-rrc-re-establishment-in-fr1-without-serving-cell-timing-for-la-iab-mt .H6}

##### G.2.1.1.1.2.1 Test Purpose and Environment {#g.2.1.1.1.2.1-test-purpose-and-environment .H6}

The purpose is to verify that the NR intra-frequency RRC
re-establishment delay in FR1 without serving cell timing is within the
specified limits. These tests will verify the requirements in clause
12.1.1.1. This test case is applicable only for local area IAB-MT and
for IAB type 1-H.

The test parameters are given in table G.2.1.1.1.2.1-1, table
G.2.1.1.1.2.1-2 and table G.2.1.1.1.2.1-3 below. The test consists of 3
successive time periods, with time duration of T1, T2 and T3
respectively. At the start of time period T2, cell 1, which is the
active cell, is deactivated. The time period T3 starts after the
occurrence of the radio link failure.

##### G.2.1.1.1.2.2 Test Requirements {#g.2.1.1.1.2.2-test-requirements .H6}

The RRC re-establishment delay is defined as the time from the start of
time period T3, to the moment when the IAB-MT starts to send PRACH
preambles to cell 2 for sending the *RRCReestablishmentRequest* message
to cell 2.

The RRC re-establishment delay to an unknown NR intra frequency cell
without serving cell timing shall be less than 8.1 s.

> The rate of correct RRC re-establishments observed during repeated
> tests shall be at least 90%.
>
> NOTE: The RRC re-establishment delay in the test is derived from the
> following expression:

$$T_{re - establish\_ delay} = T_{IAB - MT\_ re - establish\_ delay} + T_{UL\_ grant}$$

> Where:
>
> T~UL\_grant~ = It is the time required to acquire and process uplink
> grant from the target cell. The PRACH reception is used as a trigger
> for the completion of the test; hence T~UL\_grant~ is not used.

$$T_{IAB - MT\_ re - establish\_ delay} = 400\ \text{ms} + T_{identify\_ intra\_ NR} + \sum_{i = 1}^{N_{\text{freq}} - 1}T_{identify\_ inter\_ NR,i} + T_{SI - NR} + T_{\text{PRACH}}$$

> N~freq~ = 1
>
> *T~identify\_intra\_NR~* = 6400 ms
>
> T~SI~ *= 1280 ms; it is the* time required for receiving all the
> relevant system information as defined in TS 38.331 \[2\] for the
> target intra-frequency NR cell.
>
> T~PRACH~ = 15 ms; it is the additional delay caused by the random
> access procedure.
>
> This gives a total of 8095 ms, allow 8.1 s in the test case.

##### G.2.1.1.1.3 Inter-frequency RRC Re-establishment in FR2 for LA IAB-MT {#g.2.1.1.1.3-inter-frequency-rrc-re-establishment-in-fr2-for-la-iab-mt .H6}

##### G.2.1.1.1.3.1 Test Purpose and Environment {#g.2.1.1.1.3.1-test-purpose-and-environment .H6}

The purpose is to verify that the NR inter-frequency RRC
re-establishment delay in FR2 without known target cell is within the
specified limits. These tests will verify the requirements in
clause 12.1.1.1. This test case is applicable only for local area IAB-MT
and for IAB type 2-O.

The test parameters are given in table G.2.1.1.1.3.1-1, table
G.2.1.1.1.3.1-2 and table G.2.1.1.1.3.1-3 below. The test consists of 3
successive time periods, with time duration of T1, T2 and T3
respectively. At the start of time period T2, cell 1, which is the
active cell, becomes inactive. The time period T3 starts after the
occurrence of the radio link failure. During T1, the IAB-MT shall be
configured with the carrier frequency of cell 2 (with RF Channel Number
\#2) to ensure that the IAB-MT has the context of the carrier frequency
of cell 2 by the end of T1.

##### G.2.1.1.1.3.2 Test Requirements {#g.2.1.1.1.3.2-test-requirements .H6}

The RRC re-establishment delay is defined as the time from the start of
time period T3, to the moment when the IAB-MT starts to send PRACH
preambles to cell 2 for sending the *RRCReestablishmentRequest* message
to cell 2.

The RRC re-establishment delay to an unknown NR inter frequency cell
shall be less than 18 s.

The rate of correct RRC re-establishments observed during repeated tests
shall be at least 90%.

> NOTE: The RRC re-establishment delay in the test is derived from the
> following expression:

$$T_{re - establish\_ delay} = T_{IAB - MT\_ re - establish\_ delay} + T_{UL\_ grant}$$

> Where:
>
> T~UL\_grant~ = It is the time required to acquire and process uplink
> grant from the target cell. The PRACH reception is used as a trigger
> for the completion of the test; hence T~UL\_grant~ is not used.

$$T_{IAB - MT\_ re - establish\_ delay} = 400\ \text{ms} + T_{identify\_ intra\_ NR} + \sum_{i = 1}^{N_{\text{freq}} - 1}T_{identify\_ inter\_ NR,i} + T_{SI - NR} + T_{\text{PRACH}}$$

> N~freq~ = 2
>
> *T~identify\_intra\_NR~* = 8000 ms
>
> *T~identify\_inter\_NR~* = 8000 ms
>
> T~SI~ *= 1280 ms; it is the* time required for receiving all the
> relevant system information as defined in TS 38.331 for the target
> inter-frequency NR cell.
>
> T~PRACH~ = 15 ms; it is the additional delay caused by the random
> access procedure.
>
> This gives a total of 17695 ms, allow 18 s in the test case.

##### G.2.1.1.1.4 Intra-frequency RRC Re-establishment in FR2 without serving cell timing for LA IAB-MT {#g.2.1.1.1.4-intra-frequency-rrc-re-establishment-in-fr2-without-serving-cell-timing-for-la-iab-mt .H6}

##### G.2.1.1.1.4.1 Test Purpose and Environment {#g.2.1.1.1.4.1-test-purpose-and-environment .H6}

The purpose is to verify that the NR intra-frequency RRC
re-establishment delay in FR2 without serving cell timing is within the
specified limits. These tests will verify the requirements in
clause 12.1.1.1. This test case is applicable only for local area IAB-MT
and for IAB type 2-O.

The test parameters are given in table G.2.1.1.1.4.1-1, table
G.2.1.1.1.4.1-2 and table G.2.1.1.1.4.1-3 below. The test consists of 3
successive time periods, with time duration of T1, T2 and T3
respectively. At the start of time period T2, cell 1, which is the
active cell, is deactivated. The time period T3 starts after the
occurrence of the radio link failure.

##### G.2.1.1.1.4.2 Test Requirements {#g.2.1.1.1.4.2-test-requirements .H6}

The RRC re-establishment delay is defined as the time from the start of
time period T3, to the moment when the IAB-MT starts to send PRACH
preambles to cell 2 for sending the *RRCReestablishmentRequest* message
to cell 2.

The RRC re-establishment delay to an unknown NR intra frequency cell
without serving cell timing shall be less than 30 s.

The rate of correct RRC re-establishments observed during repeated tests
shall be at least 90%.

> NOTE: The RRC re-establishment delay in the test is derived from the
> following expression:

$$T_{re - establish\_ delay} = T_{IAB - MT\_ re - establish\_ delay} + T_{UL\_ grant}$$

> Where:
>
> T~UL\_grant~ = It is the time required to acquire and process uplink
> grant from the target cell. The PRACH reception is used as a trigger
> for the completion of the test; hence T~UL\_grant~ is not used.

$$T_{IAB - MT\_ re - establish\_ delay} = 400\ \text{ms} + T_{identify\_ intra\_ NR} + \sum_{i = 1}^{N_{\text{freq}} - 1}T_{identify\_ inter\_ NR,i} + T_{SI - NR} + T_{\text{PRACH}}$$

> N~freq~ = 1
>
> *T~identify\_intra\_NR~* = 28160 ms
>
> T~SI~ *= 1280 ms; it is the* time required for receiving all the
> relevant system information as defined in TS 38.331 \[2\] for the
> target intra-frequency NR cell.
>
> T~PRACH~ = 15 ms; it is the additional delay caused by the random
> access procedure.

This gives a total of 29855 ms, allow 30 s in the test case.

##### G.2.1.1.2 RRC Connection Release with Redirection

##### G.2.1.1.2.1 Redirection from NR in FR1 to NR in FR1 {#g.2.1.1.2.1-redirection-from-nr-in-fr1-to-nr-in-fr1 .H6}

##### G.2.1.1.2.1.1 Test Purpose and Environment {#g.2.1.1.2.1.1-test-purpose-and-environment .H6}

This test is to verify RRC connection release with redirection from NR
to NR requirements specified in clause 12.1.1.3.

##### G.2.1.1.2.1.2 Test Parameters {#g.2.1.1.2.1.2-test-parameters .H6}

Supported test configurations are shown in table G.2.1.1.2.1.2-1. The
time delay is tested by using the parameters in table G.2.1.1.2.1.2-2,
and G.2.1.1.2.1.2-3.

The test consists of two successive time periods, with time duration of
T1, and T2 respectively. The *RRCRelease* message shall be sent to the
IAB-MT during period T1 and the start of T2 is the instant when the last
TTI containing the RRC message is sent to the IAB-MT. Prior to time
duration T2, the IAB-MT shall not have any timing information of Cell 2.
Cell 2 is powered up at the beginning of the T2.

##### G.2.1.1.2.1.3 Test Requirements {#g.2.1.1.2.1.3-test-requirements .H6}

The IAB-MT shall start to transmit the PRACH to Cell 2 less than 7480 ms
from the beginning of time period T2.

The rate of correct RRC connection release redirection to NR observed
during repeated tests shall be at least 90%.

> NOTE: The redirection delay can be expressed as:

T~connection\_release\_redirect\_NR~ = T~RRC\_procedure\_delay~ +
T~identify-NR~ + T~SI-NR~ + T~RACH~,

> where:
>
> T~RRC\_procedure\_delay~ = 110 ms in the test.
>
> T~identify-NR~ = 5440 ms in the test.
>
> T~SI-NR~ = 1280 ms, it is the time required for receiving all the
> relevant system information.
>
> T~RACH~ = 650 ms in the test.
>
> This gives a total of 7480 ms.

##### G.2.1.1.2.2 Redirection from NR in FR2 to NR in FR2 {#g.2.1.1.2.2-redirection-from-nr-in-fr2-to-nr-in-fr2 .H6}

##### G.2.1.1.2.2.1 Test Purpose and Environment {#g.2.1.1.2.2.1-test-purpose-and-environment .H6}

This test is to verify RRC connection release with redirection from NR
to NR requirements specified in clause 12.1.1.3.

##### G.2.1.1.2.2.2 Test Parameters {#g.2.1.1.2.2.2-test-parameters .H6}

Supported test configurations are shown in table G.2.1.1.2.2.2-1. The
time delay is tested by using the parameters in table G.2.1.1.2.2.2-2,
and G.2.1.1.2.2.2-3.

The test consists of two successive time periods, with time duration of
T1, and T2 respectively. The *RRCRelease* message shall be sent to the
IAB-MT during period T1 and the start of T2 is the instant when the last
TTI containing the RRC message is sent to the IAB-MT. Prior to time
duration T2, the IAB-MT shall not have any timing information of Cell 2.
Cell 2 is powered up at the beginning of the T2.

##### G.2.1.1.2.2.3 Test Requirements {#g.2.1.1.2.2.3-test-requirements .H6}

The IAB-MT shall start to transmit the PRACH to Cell 2 less than 9080 ms
from the beginning of time period T2.

The rate of correct RRC connection release redirection to NR observed
during repeated tests shall be at least 90%.

> NOTE: The redirection delay can be expressed as:

T~connection\_release\_redirect\_NR~ = T~RRC\_procedure\_delay~ +
T~identify-NR~ + T~SI-NR~ + T~RACH~,

> where:
>
> T~RRC\_procedure\_delay~ = 110 ms **in the test**.
>
> T~identify-NR~ = 7040 ms in the test.
>
> T~SI-NR~ = 1280 ms, it is the time required for receiving all the
> relevant system information.
>
> T~RACH~ = 650 ms in the test.

This gives a total of 9080 ms.

##### G.2.2.1.1 NR IAB-MT Transmit Timing Test for FR1

##### G.2.2.1.1.1 Test Purpose and environment {#g.2.2.1.1.1-test-purpose-and-environment .H6}

The purpose of this test is to verify that the IAB-MT can follow frame
timing change of the connected gNodeb and that the IAB-MT initial
transmit timing accuracy, maximum amount of timing change in one
adjustment, minimum and maximum adjustment rate are within the specified
limits. This test will verify the requirements in clause 12.2.1.2. Local
area IAB-MT type 1-H shall be tested with this test.

Supported test configurations are shown in Table G.2.2.1.1.1-1.

  Note: The IAB-MT is only required to be tested in one of the supported test configurations   

For this test a single NR cell (Cell 1) is used. Table G.2.2.1.1.1-2
defines the parameters to be configured and strength of the transmitted
signals. The transmit timing is verified by the IAB-MT transmitting SRS
using the configuration defined in Table G.2.2.1.1.1-3.

##### G.2.2.1.1.2 Test requirements {#g.2.2.1.1.2-test-requirements .H6}

The test sequence shall be carried out in RRC\_CONNECTED for every test
case.

Following will be the test sequence for this test

> 1\) Setup NR PCell according to parameters given in Table
> G.2.2.1.1.1-1.
>
> 2\) After connection set up with the cell, the test equipment will
> verify that the timing of the NR cell is within (N~TA~ +
> N~TA\_offset~) ×T~c~ ± T~e~ of the first detected path of DL SSB.
>
> a\. The N~TA~ offset value (in T~c~ units) is 25600
>

##### G.2.2.1.2 NR IAB-MT Transmit Timing Test for FR2

##### G.2.2.1.2.1 Test Purpose and environment {#g.2.2.1.2.1-test-purpose-and-environment .H6}

The purpose of this test is to verify that the IAB-MT can follow frame
timing change of the connected gNodeb and that the IAB-MT initial
transmit timing accuracy, maximum amount of timing change in one
adjustment, minimum and maximum adjustment rate are within the specified
limits. This test will verify the requirements in clause 12.2.1.2. Local
area IAB-MT type 2-O shall be tested with this test.

Supported test configurations are shown in Table G.2.2.1.2.1-1.

Table G.2.2.1.2.1-1: Supported test configurations for FR2 PCell

  Configuration   Description
  --------------- -------------------------------------------------------
  1               NR TDD, SSB SCS 240 kHz, data SCS 120 kHz, BW 100 MHz

For this test a single NR cell is used. Tables G.2.2.1.2.1-2 and Tables
G.2.2.1.2.1-2A define the parameters to be configured and strength of
the transmitted signals. The transmit timing is verified by the IAB-MT
transmitting SRS using the configuration defined in Table G.2.2.1.2.1-3.

>
> a\. The N~TA~ offset value (in T~c~ units) is 13792
>
> b\. The T~e~ values depend on the DL and UL SCS for which the test is

### G.2.3 Signalling Characteristics for IAB MTs

#### G.2.3.1 Radio link Monitoring

##### G.2.3.1.1 Radio Link Monitoring Out-of-sync Test for FR1 PCell configured with SSB-based RLM RS in non-DRX mode

##### G.2.3.1.1.1 Test Purpose and Environment {#g.2.3.1.1.1-test-purpose-and-environment .H6}

The purpose of this test is to verify that the IAB-MT properly detects
the out of sync and in sync for the purpose of monitoring downlink radio
link quality of the PCell. This test will partly verify the FR1 radio
link monitoring requirements in clause 12.3.1.

In the test, IAB-MT is configured to perform RLM on SSB, with
*detectionResource* included in *RadioLinkMonitoringRS* set to SSB\#0
and SSB\#1, and *purpose* set to '*rlf*'. Supported test configurations
are shown in table G.2.3.1.1.1-1. The test parameters are given in
Tables G.2.3.1.1-2 and G.2.3.1.1.1-3 below. There is one cell (Cell 1),
which is the active NR cell, in the test. The test consists of three
successive time periods, with time duration of T1, T2 and T3
respectively. Figure G.2.3.1.1.1-1 shows the variation of the downlink
SNR in the active cell to emulate out-of-sync and in-sync states. Prior
to the start of the time duration T1, the IAB-MT shall be fully
synchronized to Cell 1. The IAB-MT shall be configured for periodic CSI
reporting with a reporting periodicity of 5 ms.

Figure G.2.3.1.1.1-1: SNR variation for out-of-sync testing

##### G.2.3.1.1.2 Test Requirements {#g.2.3.1.1.2-test-requirements .H6}

The IAB-MT behaviour in each test during time durations T1, T2 and T3
shall be as follows:

During the period from time point A to time point B the IAB-MT shall
transmit uplink signal at least in all uplink slots configured for CSI
transmission according to the configured periodic CSI reporting.

The IAB-MT shall stop transmitting uplink signal no later than time
point C (D1 second after the start of the time duration T3).

The rate of correct events observed during repeated tests shall be at
least 90%.

##### G.2.3.1.2 Radio Link Monitoring In-sync Test for FR1 PCell configured with SSB-based RLM RS in non-DRX mode

##### G.2.3.1.2.1 Test Purpose and Environment {#g.2.3.1.2.1-test-purpose-and-environment .H6}

The purpose of this test is to verify that the IAB-MT properly detects
the out of sync and in sync for the purpose of monitoring downlink radio
link quality of the PCell. This test will partly verify the FR1 radio
link monitoring requirements in clause 12.3.1.

In the test, IAB-MT is configured to perform RLM on SSB, with
*detectionResource* included in *RadioLinkMonitoringRS* set to SSB\#0
and SSB\#1, and *purpose* set to '*rlf*'. Supported test configurations
are shown in table G.2.3.1.2.1-1. The test parameters are given in
Tables G.2.3.1.2.1-2, and G.2.3.1.2.1-3 below. There is one cell (Cell
1), which is the active cell, in the test. The test consists of five
successive time periods, with time duration of T1, T2, T3, T4 and T5
respectively. Figure G.2.3.1.2.1-1 shows the variation of the downlink
SNR in the active cell to emulate out-of-sync and in-sync states. Prior
to the start of the time duration T1, the IAB-MT shall be fully
synchronized to Cell 1. Prior to the start of the time duration T1, the
IAB-MT shall be fully synchronized to Cell 1. The IAB-MT shall be
configured for periodic CSI reporting with a reporting periodicity of 5
ms.

Figure G.2.3.1.2.1-1: SNR variation for in-sync testing

##### G.2.3.1.2.2 Test Requirements {#g.2.3.1.2.2-test-requirements .H6}

The IAB-MT behaviour in each test during time durations T1, T2, T3, T4
and T5 shall be as follows:

During the period from time point A to time point F (D1 second after the
start of time duration T5) the IAB-MT shall transmit uplink signal at
least in all uplink slots configured for CSI transmission according to
the configured periodic CSI reporting.

The rate of correct events observed during repeated tests shall be at
least 90%.

##### G.2.3.1.3 Radio Link Monitoring Out-of-sync Test for FR2 PCell configured with SSB-based RLM RS in non-DRX mode

##### G.2.3.1.3.1 Test Purpose and Environment {#g.2.3.1.3.1-test-purpose-and-environment .H6}

The purpose of this test is to verify that the IAB-MT properly detects
the out of sync and in sync for the purpose of monitoring downlink radio
link quality of the PCell. This test will partly verify the FR2 radio
link monitoring requirements in clause 12.3.1.

In the test, IAB-MT is configured to perform RLM on SSB, with
*detectionResource* included in *RadioLinkMonitoringRS* set to SSB\#0
and SSB\#1, and *purpose* set to '*rlf*'. Supported test configurations
are shown in table G.2.3.1.3.1-1. The test parameters are given in
Tables G.2.3.1.3.1-2 and G.2.3.1.3.1-3 below. There is one cell (Cell
1), which is the active NR cell, in the test. The test consists of three
successive time periods, with time duration of T1, T2 and T3
respectively. Figure G.2.3.1.3.1-1 shows the variation of the downlink
SNR in the active cell to emulate out-of-sync and in-sync states, and
Figure G.2.3.1.3.1-2 shows the Time multiplexed downlink transmissions
from each Angle of Arrival. Prior to the start of the time duration T1,
the IAB-MT shall be fully synchronized to Cell 1. The IAB-MT shall be
configured for periodic CSI reporting with a reporting periodicity of 5
ms.

Figure G.2.3.1.3.1-1: SNR variation for out-of-sync testing

Figure G.2.3.1.3.1-2: Time multiplexed downlink transmissions

##### G.2.3.1.3.2 Test Requirements {#g.2.3.1.3.2-test-requirements .H6}

The IAB-MT behavior in each test during time durations T1, T2 and T3
shall be as follows:

During the period from time point A to time point B the IAB-MT shall
transmit uplink signal at least in all uplink slots configured for CSI
transmission according to the configured periodic CSI reporting.

The IAB-MT shall stop transmitting uplink signal no later than time
point C (D1 second after the start of the time duration T3).

The rate of correct events observed during repeated tests shall be at
least 90%.

##### G.2.3.1.4 Radio Link Monitoring In-sync Test for FR2 PCell configured with SSB-based RLM RS in non-DRX mode

##### G.2.3.1.4.1 Test Purpose and Environment {#g.2.3.1.4.1-test-purpose-and-environment .H6}

The purpose of this test is to verify that the IAB-MT properly detects
the out of sync and in sync for the purpose of monitoring downlink radio
link quality of the PCell. This test will partly verify the FR2 radio
link monitoring requirements in clause 12.3.1.

In the test, IAB-MT is configured to perform RLM on SSB, with
*detectionResource* included in *RadioLinkMonitoringRS* set to SSB\#0
and SSB\#1, and *purpose* set to '*rlf*'. Supported test configurations
are shown in table G.2.3.1.4.1-1. The test parameters are given in
Tables G.2.3.1.4.1-2, and G.2.3.1.4.1-3 below. There is one cell (Cell
1), which is the active cell, in the test. The test consists of five
successive time periods, with time duration of T1, T2, T3, T4 and T5
respectively. Figure G.2.3.1.4.1-1 shows the variation of the downlink
SNR in the active cell to emulate out-of-sync and in-sync states, and
Figure G.2.3.1.4.1-2 shows the Time multiplexed downlink transmissions
from each Angle of Arrival. Prior to the start of the time duration T1,
the IAB-MT shall be fully synchronized to Cell 1. Prior to the start of
the time duration T1, the IAB-MT shall be fully synchronized to Cell 1.
The IAB-MT shall be configured for periodic CSI reporting with a
reporting periodicity of 5 ms.

Figure G.2.3.1.4.1-1: SNR variation for in-sync testing

Figure G.2.3.1.4.1-2: Time multiplexed downlink transmissions

##### G.2.3.1.4.2 Test Requirements {#g.2.3.1.4.2-test-requirements .H6}

The IAB-MT behaviour in each test during time durations T1, T2, T3, T4
and T5 shall be as follows:

During the period from time point A to time point F (D1 second after the
start of time duration T5) the IAB-MT shall transmit uplink signal at
least in all uplink slots configured for CSI transmission according to
the configured periodic CSI reporting.

The rate of correct events observed during repeated tests shall be at
least 90%.

##### G.2.3.1.5 Radio Link Monitoring Out-of-sync Test for FR1 PCell configured with CSI-RS-based RLM in non-DRX mode

##### G.2.3.1.5.1 Test Purpose and Environment {#g.2.3.1.5.1-test-purpose-and-environment .H6}

The purpose of this test is to verify that the IAB-MT properly detects
the out of sync for the purpose of monitoring downlink CSI-RS based
radio link quality of the PCell. This test will partly verify the FR1
PCell CSI-RS Out-of-sync radio link monitoring requirements in
clause 12.3.1.3. This test case is applicable only for local area IAB-MT
and for IAB type 1-H.

The test parameters are given in Tables G.2.3.1.5.1-1, G.2.3.1.5.1-2 and
G.2.3.1.5.1-3 below. There is one cell, cell 1 which is the PCell, in
the test. The test consists of three successive time periods, with time
duration of T1, T2 and T3 respectively. Figure G.2.3.1.5.1-1 shows the
variation of the downlink SNR in the PCell to emulate out-of-sync and
in-sync states. Prior to the start of the time duration T1, the IAB-MT
shall be fully synchronized to cell 1. The IAB-MT shall be configured
for periodic CSI reporting with a reporting periodicity defined in
CSI-RS configuration. In the test, SSB0 is configured as the BFD-RS.

Figure G.2.3.1.5.1-1: SNR variation for CSI-RS out-of-sync testing

##### G.2.3.1.5.2 Test Requirements {#g.2.3.1.5.2-test-requirements .H6}

The IAB-MT behaviour during time durations T1, T2, and T3 shall be as
follows:

During time durations T1, T2 and T3, the IAB-MT shall transmit uplink
signal at least in all subframes configured for CSI transmission on Cell
1.

During the period from time point A to time point B the IAB-MT shall
transmit uplink signal in Cell 1 at least in all uplink slots configured
for CSI transmission according to the configured periodic CSI reporting
for Cell 1.

The IAB-MT shall stop transmitting uplink signal in Cell 1 no later than
time point C (D~1~ ms after the start of the time duration T3) on the
PCell.

The rate of correct events observed during repeated tests shall be at
least 90%.

##### G.2.3.1.6 Radio Link Monitoring In-sync Test for FR1 PCell configured with CSI-RS-based RLM in non-DRX mode

##### G.2.3.1.6.1 Test Purpose and Environment {#g.2.3.1.6.1-test-purpose-and-environment .H6}

The purpose of this test is to verify that the IAB-MT properly detects
the in sync for the purpose of monitoring downlink CSI-RS based radio
link quality of the PCell. This test will partly verify the FR1 PCell
CSI-RS In-sync radio link monitoring requirements in clause 12.3.1.3.
This test case is applicable only for local area IAB-MT and for IAB type
1-H.

The test parameters are given in Tables G.2.3.1.6.1-1, G.2.3.1.6.1-2,
and G.2.3.1.6.1-3 below. There is one cells, cell 1which is the PCell,
in the test. The test consists of five successive time periods, with
time duration of T1, T2, T3, T4 and T5 respectively. Figure
G.2.3.1.6.1-1 shows the variation of the downlink SNR in the PCell to
emulate out-of-sync and in-sync states. Prior to the start of the time

Figure G.2.3.1.6.1-1: SNR variation for CSI-RS in-sync testing

##### G.2.3.1.6.2 Test Requirements {#g.2.3.1.6.2-test-requirements .H6}

The IAB-MT behaviour in each test during time durations T1, T2, T3, T4
and T5 shall be as follows:

During the period from time point A to time point F (T6 second after the
start of time duration T5) the IAB-MT shall transmit uplink signal at
least in all uplink slots configured for CSI transmission according to
the configured periodic CSI reporting on the PCell.

The rate of correct events observed during repeated tests shall be at
least 90%.

##### G.2.3.1.7 Radio Link Monitoring Out-of-sync Test for FR2 PCell configured with CSI-RS-based RLM in non-DRX mode

##### G.2.3.1.7.1 Test Purpose and Environment {#g.2.3.1.7.1-test-purpose-and-environment .H6}

The purpose of this test is to verify that the IAB-MT properly detects
the out of sync for the purpose of monitoring downlink CSI-RS based
radio link quality of the PCell. This test will partly verify the FR2
PCell CSI-RS Out-of-sync radio link monitoring requirements in
clause 12.3.1.3. This test case is applicable only for local area IAB-MT
and for IAB type 2-0.

The test parameters are given in Tables G.2.3.1.7.1-1, G.2.3.1.7.1-2 and
G.2.3.1.7.1-3 below. There is one cell, cell 1 which is the PCell, in
the test. The test consists of three successive time periods, with time
duration of T1, T2 and T3 respectively. Figure G.2.3.1.7.1-1 shows the
variation of the downlink SNR in the PCell to emulate out-of-sync and
in-sync states. Prior to the start of the time duration T1, the IAB-MT
shall be fully synchronized to cell 1. The IAB-MT shall be configured
for periodic CSI reporting with a reporting periodicity of 10 ms. In the
test, SSB0 and SSB1 are configured as BFD-RS.

Figure G.2.3.1.7.1-1: SNR variation for CSI-RS out-of-sync testing

##### G.2.3.1.7.2 Test Requirements {#g.2.3.1.7.2-test-requirements .H6}

The IAB-MT behaviour during time durations T1, T2, and T3 shall be as
follows:

During time durations T1, T2 and T3, the IAB-MT shall transmit uplink
signal at least in all subframes configured for CSI transmission on Cell
1.

During the period from time point A to time point B the IAB-MT shall
transmit uplink signal in Cell 1 at least in all uplink slots configured
for CSI transmission according to the configured periodic CSI reporting
for Cell 1.

The IAB-MT shall stop transmitting uplink signal in Cell 1 no later than
time point C (D~1~ second after the start of the time duration T3) on
the PCell.

The rate of correct events observed during repeated tests shall be at
least 90%.

##### G.2.3.1.8 Radio Link Monitoring In-sync Test for FR2 PCell configured with CSI-RS-based RLM in non-DRX mode

##### G.2.3.1.8.1 Test Purpose and Environment {#g.2.3.1.8.1-test-purpose-and-environment .H6}

The purpose of this test is to verify that the IAB-MT properly detects
the in sync for the purpose of monitoring downlink CSI-RS based radio
link quality of the PCell. This test will partly verify the FR2 PCell
CSI-RS In-sync radio link monitoring requirements in clause 12.3.1.3.
This test case is applicable only for local area IAB-MT and for IAB type
2-O.

The test parameters are given in Tables G.2.3.1.8.1-1, G.2.3.1.8.1-2 and
G.2.3.1.8.1-3 below. There is one cells, cell 1which is the PCell, in
the test. The test consists of five successive time periods, with time
duration of T1, T2, T3, T4 and T5 respectively. Figure G.2.3.1.8.1-1
shows the variation of the downlink SNR in the PCell to emulate
out-of-sync and in-sync states. Prior to the start of the time duration
T1, the IAB-MT shall be fully synchronized to cell 1. The IAB-MT shall
be configured for periodic CSI reporting with a reporting periodicity of
10 ms. In the test, SSB0 and SSB1 are configured as BFD-RS.

Figure G.2.3.1.8.1-1: SNR variation for CSI-RS in-sync testing

##### G.2.3.1.8.2 Test Requirements {#g.2.3.1.8.2-test-requirements .H6}

The IAB-MT behaviour in each test during time durations T1, T2, T3, T4
and T5 shall be as follows:

During the period from time point A to time point F (D1 second after the
start of time duration T5) the IAB-MT shall transmit uplink signal at
least in all uplink slots configured for CSI transmission according to
the configured periodic CSI reporting on the PCell.

The rate of correct events observed during repeated tests shall be at
least 90%.

#### G.2.3.2 Beam Failure Detection and Link Recovery Procedure

##### G.2.3.2.1 Beam Failure Detection and Link Recovery Test for FR1 PCell configured with SSB-based BFD and LR

##### G.2.3.2.1.1 Test Purpose and Environment {#g.2.3.2.1.1-test-purpose-and-environment .H6}

The purpose of this test is to verify that the IAB-MT properly detects
SSB-based beam failure in the set q~0~ configured for a serving cell and
that the IAB-MT performs correct SSB-based link recovery based on beam
candidate set q~1~. The purpose is to test the downlink monitoring for
beam failure detection within the IAB-MTs active DL BWP, during the
evaluation period, and link recovery. This test will partly verify the
SSB based beam failure detection and link recovery for an FR1 serving
cell requirements in clause 12.3.2.

The test parameters are given in Tables G.2.3.2.1.1-1, G.2.3.2.1.1-2 and
G.2.3.2.1.1-3 below. There is one cell, cell 1 which is the active cell,
in the test. The test consists of five successive time periods, with
time duration of T1, T2, T3, T4 and T5 respectively. Figure
G.2.3.2.1.1-1 shows the variation of the downlink SNR of the SSB in set
q~0~ in the active cell to emulate SSB based beam failure. Figure
G.2.3.2.1.1-1 additionally shows the variation of the downlink L1-RSRP
of the SSB in set q~1~ of the candidate beam used for link recovery.
Prior to the start of the time duration T1, the IAB-MT shall be fully
synchronized to cell 1. The IAB-MT shall be configured for periodic CSI
reporting with a reporting periodicity of 2 ms. The IAB-MT is configured
to perform inter-frequency measurements using GP ID \#0 (40ms) in test
1.

failure detection and link recovery testing

##### G.2.3.2.1.2 Test Requirements {#g.2.3.2.1.2-test-requirements .H6}

The IAB-MT behaviour during time durations T1, T2, T3, T4 and T5 shall
be as follows:

During the time duration T1 and T2, the IAB-MT shall transmit uplink
signal at least in all subframes configured for CSI transmission on Cell
1.

During the period from time point A to time point B the IAB-MT shall
transmit uplink signal in Cell 1 in all uplink slots configured for CSI
transmission according to the configured periodic CSI reporting for Cell
1.

During T3 the IAB-MT shall detect beam failure and initiate link
recovery. During T4 and T5 the IAB-MT measures and evaluate beam
candidate from beam candidate set q~1~.

No later than time point F occurring no later than D1 = 120+10 ms after
the start of T5, the IAB-MT shall transmit preamble on a beam associated
with the candidate beam set q~1~. The IAB-MT shall not transmit preamble
on a beam associated with the candidate beam set q~1~ earlier than time
point B.

Test is concluded once the test equipment has received the initial
preamble transmission from the IAB-MT. The rate of correct events
observed during repeated tests shall be at least 90%.

##### G.2.3.2.2 Beam Failure Detection and Link Recovery Test for FR2 PCell configured with SSB-based BFD and LR 

##### G.2.3.2.2.1 Test Purpose and Environment {#g.2.3.2.2.1-test-purpose-and-environment .H6}

The purpose of this test is to verify that the IAB-MT properly detects
SSB-based beam failure in the set q~0~ configured for a serving cell and
that the IAB-MT performs correct SSB-based link recovery based on beam
candidate set q~1~. The purpose is to test the downlink monitoring for
beam failure detection within the IAB-MT active DL BWP, during the
evaluation period, and link recovery, when no DRX is used. This test
will partly verify the SSB based beam failure detection and link
recovery for an FR2 serving cell requirements in clause 12.3.2.2.

The test parameters are given in Tables G.2.3.2.2.1-1, G.2.3.2.2.1-2 and
G.2.3.2.2.1-3 below. There is one cell, cell 1 which is the active cell,
in the test. The test consists of five successive time periods, with
time duration of T1, T2, T3, T4 and T5 respectively. Figure
G.2.3.2.X.1-1 shows the variation of the downlink SNR of the SSB in set
q~0~ in the active cell to emulate SSB based beam failure. Figure
G.2.3.2.2.1-1 additionally shows the variation of the downlink L1-RSRP
of the SSB in set q~1~ of the candidate beam used for link recovery.
Prior to the start of the time duration T1, the IAB-MT shall be fully
synchronized to cell 1. The IAB-MT shall be configured for periodic CSI
reporting with a reporting periodicity of 2 ms. In the test, DRX
configuration is not enabled.

Figure G.2.3.2.2.1-1: SNR and L1-RSRP variation SSB for SSB-based beam
failure detection and link recovery testing in non-DRX mode

##### G.2.3.2.2.2 Test Requirements {#g.2.3.2.2.2-test-requirements .H6}

The IAB-MT behaviour during time durations T1, T2, T3, T4 and T5 shall
be as follows:

During the time duration T1 and T2, the IAB-MT shall transmit uplink
signal at least in all subframes configured for CSI transmission on Cell
1.

During the period from time point A to time point B the IAB-MT shall
transmit uplink signal in Cell 1 in all uplink slots configured for CSI
transmission according to the configured periodic CSI reporting for Cell
1.

During T3 the IAB-MT shall detect beam failure and initiate link
recovery. During T4 and T5 the IAB-MT measures and evaluate beam
candidate from beam candidate set q~1~.

No later than time point F occurring no later than D1 = 560+650 ms after
the start of T5, the IAB-MT shall transmit preamble on a beam associated
with the candidate beam set q~1~. The IAB-MT shall not transmit preamble
on a beam associated with the candidate beam set q~1~ earlier than time
point B.

Test is concluded once the test equipment has received the initial
preamble transmission from the IAB-MT. The rate of correct events
observed during repeated tests shall be at least 90%.

##### G.2.3.2.3 Beam Failure Detection and Link Recovery Test for FR1 PCell configured with CSI-RS-based BFD and LR

##### G.2.3.2.3.1 Test Purpose and Environment {#g.2.3.2.3.1-test-purpose-and-environment .H6}

The purpose of this test is to verify that the IAB-MT properly detects
CSI-RS-based beam failure in the set q~0~ configured for a serving cell
and that the IAB-MT performs correct CSI-RS-based link recovery based on
beam candicate set q~1~. The purpose is to test the downlink monitoring
for beam failure detection within the IAB-MTs active DL BWP, during the
evaluation period, and link recovery. This test will partly verify the
CSI-RS based beam failure detection and link recovery for an FR1 serving
cell requirements in clause 12.3.2.

The test parameters are given in Tables G.2.3.2.3.1-1, G.2.3.2.3.1-2 and
G.2.3.2.3.1-3 below. There is one cell, cell 1 which is the active cell,
in the test. The test consists of five successive time periods, with
time duration of T1, T2, T3, T4 and T5 respectively. Figure
G.2.3.2.3.1-1 shows the variation of the downlink SNR of the CSI-RS in
set q~0~ in the active cell to emulate CSI-RS based beam failure. Figure
G.2.3.2.3.1-1 additionally shows the variation of the downlink L1-RSRP
of the CSI-RS in set q~1~ of the candidate beam used for link recovery.
Prior to the start of the time duration T1, the IAB-MT shall be fully
synchronized to cell 1. The IAB-MT shall be configured for periodic CSI
reporting with a reporting periodicity of \[2\] ms.

Figure G.2.3.2.3.1-1: SNR and L1-RSRP variation for CSI-RS-based beam
failure detection and link recovery testing

##### G.2.3.2.3.2 Test Requirements {#g.2.3.2.3.2-test-requirements .H6}

The IAB-MT behaviour during time durations T1, T2, T3, T4 and T5 shall
be as follows:

During the time duration T1 and T2, the IAB-MT shall transmit uplink
signal at least in all subframes configured for CSI transmission on Cell
1.

During the period from time point A to time point B the IAB-MT shall
transmit uplink signal in Cell 1 in all uplink slots configured for CSI
transmission according to the configured periodic CSI reporting for Cell
1.

During T3 the shall detect beam failure and initiat link recovery.
During T4 and T5 the IAB-MT measures and evaluate beam candidate from
beam candidate set q~1~.

No later than time point F occurring no later than D1 = 30+10 ms after
the start of T5, the IAB-MT shall transmit preamble on a beam associated
with the candidate beam set q~1~. The IAB-MT shall not transmit preamble
on a beam associated with the candidate beam set q~1~ earlier than time
point B.

Test is concluded once the test equipment has received the initial
preamble transmission from the IAB-MT. The rate of correct events
observed during repeated tests shall be at least 90%.

##### G.2.3.2.4 Beam Failure Detection and Link Recovery Test for FR2 PCell configured with CSI-RS-based BFD and LR in non-DRX mode

##### G.2.3.2.4.1 Test Purpose and Environment {#g.2.3.2.4.1-test-purpose-and-environment .H6}

The purpose of this test is to verify that the IAB-MT properly detects
CSI-RS-based beam failure in the set q~0~ configured for a serving cell
and that the IAB-MT performs correct CSI-RS-based link recovery based on
beam candicate set q~1~. The purpose is to test the downlink monitoring
for beam failure detection within the IAB-MT's active DL BWP, during the
evaluation period, and link recovery, when no DRX is used. This test
will partly verify the CSI-RS based beam failure detection and link
recovery for an FR2 serving cell requirements in clause 12.3.2.

The test parameters are given in Tables G.2.3.2.4.1-1, G.2.3.2.4.1-2,
and G.2.3.2.4.1-3 below. There is one cell, cell 1 which is the active
cell, in the test. The test consists of five successive time periods,
with time duration of T1, T2, T3, T4 and T5 respectively. Figure
G.2.3.2.4.1-1 shows the variation of the downlink SNR of the CSI-RS in
set q~0~ in the active cell to emulate CSI-RS based beam failure. Figure
G.2.3.2.4.1-1 additionally shows the variation of the downlink L1-RSRP
of the CSI-RS in set q~1~ of the candidate beam used for link recovery.
Prior to the start of the time duration T1, the IAB-MT shall be fully
synchronized to cell 1. The IAB-MT shall be configured for periodic CSI
reporting with a reporting periodicity of \[2\] ms. In the test, DRX
configuration is not enabled.

##### G.2.3.2.4.2 Test Requirements {#g.2.3.2.4.2-test-requirements .H6}

The IAB-MT behaviour during time durations T1, T2, T3, T4 and T5 shall
be as follows:

During the time duration T1 and T2, the IAB-MT shall transmit uplink
signal at least in all subframes configured for CSI transmission on Cell
1.

During the period from time point A to time point B the IAB-MT shall
transmit uplink signal in Cell 1 in all uplink slots configured for CSI
transmission according to the configured periodic CSI reporting for Cell
1.

During T3 the shall detect beam failure and initiat link recovery.
During T4 and T5 the IAB-MT measures and evaluate beam candidate from
beam candidate set q~1~.

No later than time point F occurring no later than D1 = 30 +10 ms after
the start of T5, the IAB-MT shall transmit preamble on a beam associated
with the candidate beam set q~1~. The IAB-MT shall not transmit preamble
on a beam associated with the candidate beam set q~1~ earlier than time
point B.

Test is concluded once the test equipment has received the initial
preamble transmission from the IAB-MT. The rate of correct events
observed during repeated tests shall be at least 90%.

######## Annex I (normative): Propagation conditions

I.1 Static propagation condition
--------------------------------

The propagation for the static performance measurement is an Additive
White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) environment. No fading or multi-paths exist
for this propagation model.

### I.1.1 IAB-MT receiver with 2RX

For 1 port transmission the channel matrix is defined in the frequency
domain by:

![](media/image49.wmf){width="0.5118055555555555in"
height="0.4479166666666667in"}.

For 2 port transmission the channel matrix is defined in the frequency
domain by:

![](media/image50.wmf){width="0.8243055555555555in"
height="0.4479166666666667in"}.

For 4 port transmission the channel matrix is defined in the frequency
domain by:

![](media/image51.wmf){width="1.0243055555555556in"
height="0.4479166666666667in"}

For 8 port transmission the channel matrix is defined in the frequency
domain by:

![](media/image52.wmf){width="1.6083333333333334in"
height="0.4479166666666667in"}

I.2 Multi-path fading propagation conditions
--------------------------------------------

### I.2.1 General

The multipath propagation conditions consist of several parts:

> \- A delay profile in the form of a \"tapped delay-line\",
> characterized by a number of taps at fixed positions on a sampling
> grid. The profile can be further characterized by the r.m.s. delay
> spread and the maximum delay spanned by the taps.
>
> \- A combination of channel model parameters that include the Delay
> profile and the Doppler spectrum that is characterized by a classical
> spectrum shape and a maximum Doppler frequency.
>
> \- Different models are used for FR1 (410 MHz - 7.125 GHz) and FR2
> (24.25 GHz -- 52.6 GHz).

### I.2.2 Delay profiles

#### I.2.2.1 General

The delay profiles are simplified from the TR 38.901 \[27\] TDL models.
The simplification steps are shown below for information. These steps
are only used when new delay profiles are created. Otherwise, the delay
profiles specified in I.2.2.1 can be used as such.

\- Step 1: Use the original TDL model from TR 38.901 \[27\].

\- Step 2: Re-order the taps in ascending delays.

\- Step 3: Perform delay scaling according to the procedure described in
clause 7.7.3 in TR 38.901 \[27\].

\- Step 4: Apply the quantization to the delay resolution 5 ns. This is
done simply by rounding the tap delays to the nearest multiple of the
delay resolution.

\- Step 5: If multiple taps are rounded to the same delay bin, merge
them by calculating their linear power sum.

\- Step 6: If there are more than 12 taps in the quantized model, merge
the taps as follows:

\- Find the weakest tap from all taps (both merged and unmerged taps are
considered):

> \- If there are two or more taps having the same value and are the
> weakest, select the tap with the smallest delay as the weakest tap.

\- When the weakest tap is the first delay tap, merge taps as follows:

\- Update the power of the first delay tap as the linear power sum of
the weakest tap and the second delay tap.

\- Remove the second delay tap.

\- When the weakest tap is the last delay tap, merge taps as follows:

\- Update the power of the last delay tap as the linear power sum of the
second-to-last tap and the last tap.

\- Remove the second-to-last tap.

\- Otherwise:

\- For each side of the weakest tap, identify the neighbour tap that has
the smaller delay difference to the weakest tap.

\- When the delay difference between the weakest tap and the identified
neighbour tap on one side equals the delay difference between the
weakest tap and the identified neighbour tap on the other side.

\- Select the neighbour tap that is weaker in power for merging.

\- Otherwise, select the neighbour tap that has smaller delay difference
for merging.

\- To merge, the power of the merged tap is the linear sum of the power
of the weakest tap and the selected tap.

\- When the selected tap is the first tap, the location of the merged
tap is the location of the first tap. The weakest tap is removed.

\- When the selected tap is the last tap, the location of the merged tap
is the location of the last tap. The weakest tap is removed.

\- Otherwise, the location of the merged tap is based on the average
delay of the weakest tap and selected tap. If the average delay is on
the sampling grid, the location of the merged tap is the average delay.
Otherwise, the location of the merged tap is rounded towards the
direction of the selected tap (e.g. 10 ns & 20 ns 15 ns, 10 ns & 25 ns
20 ns, if 25 ns had higher or equal power; 15 ns, if 10 ns had higher
power). The weakest tap and the selected tap are removed.

\- Repeat step 6 until the final number of taps is 12.

\- Step 7: Round the amplitudes of taps to one decimal (e.g. -8.78 dB
-8.8 dB)

\- Step 8: If the delay spread has slightly changed due to the tap
merge, adjust the final delay spread by increasing or decreasing the
power of the last tap so that the delay spread is corrected.

\- Step 9: Re-normalize the highest tap to 0 dB.

Note 1: Some values of the delay profile created by the simplification
steps may differ from the values in tables I.2.2.2-2, I.2.2.2-3, and
I.2.1.1-4 for the corresponding model.

Note 2: For Step 5 and Step 6, the power values are expressed in the
linear domain using 6 digits of precision. The operations are in the
linear domain.

#### I.2.2.2 Delay profiles for FR1

The delay profiles for FR1 are selected to be representative of low,
medium and high delay spread environment. The resulting model parameters

##### I.2.4.2.3 MIMO correlation matrices at high, medium and low level

The correlation matrices for high, medium and low correlation are
defined in table I.2.4.2.3-2, I.2.4.2.3-3 and I.2.4.2.3-4 as below.

The values in table I.2.4.2.3-2 have been adjusted for the 2x4 and 4x4
high correlation cases to ensure the correlation matrix is positive
semi-definite after round-off to 4 digit precision. This is done using
the equation:

![](media/image70.wmf){width="2.0in" height="0.2798611111111111in"}

Where the value \"a\" is a scaling factor such that the smallest value
is used to obtain a positive semi-definite result. For the 2x4 high
correlation case, a = 0.00010. For the 4x4 high correlation case, a =
0.00012.

The same method is used to adjust the 4x4 medium correlation matrix in
table I.2.4.2.3-3 to insure the correlation matrix is positive
semi-definite after round-off to 4 digit precision with a = 0.00012.

low correlation.

#### I.2.4.3 Multi-antenna channel models using cross polarized antennas

##### I.2.4.3.1 General

The MIMO channel correlation matrices defined in annex I.2.4.3 apply to
two cases as presented below:

\- One TX antenna and multiple RX antennas case, with cross polarized
antennas used at IAB-DU/gNB

\- Multiple TX antennas and multiple RX antennas case, with cross
polarized antennas used at IAB-MT/UE

The cross-polarized antenna elements with +/-45 degrees polarization
slant angles are deployed at IAB. For one TX antenna case, antenna
element with +90 degree polarization slant angle is deployed at
IAB-MT/UE. For multiple TX antennas case, cross-polarized antenna
elements with +90/0 degrees polarization slant angles are deployed at
IAB-MT/UE.

For the cross-polarized antennas, the N antennas are labelled such that
antennas for one polarization are listed from 1 to N/2 and antennas for
the other polarization are listed from N/2+1 to N, where N is the number
of TX or RX antennas.

I.3 Physical signals, channels mapping and precoding
----------------------------------------------------

### I.3.1 General

Unless otherwise stated, the transmission on antenna port(s)
$p = p_{0},\ p_{0} + 1,...,\ p_{0} + N_{p} - 1$ is defined by using a
precoder matrix of size $N_{\text{ANT}} \times N_{p}$, where
$N_{\text{ANT}}\ $is the number of physical transmit antenna elements
configured per test , $N_{p}$ is the number of ports for a reference
signal or physical channel configured per test, and $p_{0}$ is the first
port for that reference signal or physical channel as defined in clauses
7.3 and 7.4 in TS 38.211 \[8\]. This precoder takes as an input a block
of signals for antenna port(s)
$p = p_{0},p_{0} + 1,...,p_{0} + N_{p} - 1$,
$y^{\left( p \right)}\left( i \right) = \left\lbrack y^{\left( p_{0} \right)}\left( i \right)\text{\ \ }y^{\left( p_{0} + 1 \right)}\left( i \right)\ \ldots\ \ \ y^{\left( p_{0} + N_{p} - 1 \right)}\left( i \right) \right\rbrack^{T}$,
, with being the number of modulation symbols per antenna port including
the reference signal symbols, and generates a block of signals
$y_{\text{bf}}^{\left( q \right)}\left( i \right) = \left\lbrack y_{\text{bf}}^{\left( 0 \right)}\left( i \right)\text{\ \ }y_{\text{bf}}^{\left( 1 \right)}\left( i \right)\ \ldots\ \ \ y_{\text{bf}}^{\left( N_{\text{ANT}} - 1 \right)}\left( i \right) \right\rbrack^{T}$
the elements of which are to be mapped onto the frequency-time index
pair as per the test configuration but transmitted on different physical
antenna elements:

$$y_{\text{bf}}^{\left( q \right)}\left( i \right) = W\left( i \right)y^{\left( p \right)}(i)$$

For Clause 8.2.3 and 11.2.3, the transmission of PDCCH and PDCCH DMRS on
antenna port $p = p_{0}$ is defined by using a precoder matrix of size
2x1. This precoder takes as an input a block of signals for antenna
port(s) $p = p_{0}$,
$y^{\left( p \right)}\left( i \right) = y^{\left( p_{0} \right)}\left( i \right)$
and generates a block of signals
$y_{\text{bf}}^{\left( q \right)}\left( i \right) = \left\lbrack y_{\text{bf}}^{\left( 0 \right)}\left( i \right)\text{\ \ }y_{\text{bf}}^{\left( \frac{N_{\text{ANT}}}{2} \right)}\left( i \right) \right\rbrack^{T}$
the elements of which are to be mapped onto the frequency-time index
pair as per the test configuration but transmitted on different physical
antenna elements:

$$y_{\text{bf}}^{\left( q \right)}\left( i \right) = W\left( i \right)y^{\left( p \right)}(i)$$

The precoder matrix is specific to the test case configuration. is
defined in Clause 5.2.2.2 of TS 38.214 \[11\].

The transimison on PT-RS antenna port is associated (using same
precoder) with the lowest indexed DM-RS antenna port among the DM-RS
antenna ports assigned for the PDSCH.

The physical antenna elements are identified by indices, where is the
number of physical antenna elements configured per test.

Modulation symbols $y^{\left( p \right)}(i)$ with
$p \in \left\{ 4000 \right\}$ (i.e. PSS, SSS, PBCH and DM-RS for PBCH)
are directly mapped to first physical antenna element.

*Modulation symbols for CSI-RS resources which configured for tracking
with one port* are directly mapped to first physical antenna element.

*Modulation symbols for CSI-RS resources which configured for beam
refinement with one port* are directly mapped to first physical antenna
element.

*Modulation symbols for NZP CSI-RS which configured for CSI acquisition
with* are *mapped to the physical antenna index* where is the number of
NZP CSI-RS ports configured per test.
