 4 Synchronization procedures
============================

4.1 Cell search
---------------

Cell search is the procedure for a UE to acquire time and frequency
synchronization with a cell and to detect the physical layer Cell ID of
the cell.

A UE receives the following synchronization signals (SS) in order to
perform cell search: the primary synchronization signal (PSS) and
secondary synchronization signal (SSS) as defined in \[4, TS 38.211\].

A UE assumes that reception occasions of a physical broadcast channel
(PBCH), PSS, and SSS are in consecutive symbols, as defined in \[4, TS
38.211\], and form a SS/PBCH block. The UE assumes that SSS, PBCH DM-RS,
and PBCH data have same EPRE. The UE may assume that the ratio of PSS
EPRE to SSS EPRE in a SS/PBCH block is either 0 dB or 3 dB. If the UE
has not been provided dedicated higher layer parameters, the UE may
assume that the ratio of PDCCH DMRS EPRE to SSS EPRE is within -8 dB and
8 dB when the UE monitors PDCCHs for a DCI format 1\_0 with CRC
scrambled by SI-RNTI, P-RNTI, or RA-RNTI.

For a half frame with SS/PBCH blocks, the first symbol indexes for
candidate SS/PBCH blocks are determined according to the SCS of SS/PBCH
blocks as follows, where index 0 corresponds to the first symbol of the
first slot in a half-frame.

\- Case A - 15 kHz SCS: the first symbols of the candidate SS/PBCH
blocks have indexes of ![](media/image3.wmf).

\- For operation without shared spectrum channel access:

\- For carrier frequencies smaller than or equal to 3 GHz,
![](media/image4.wmf).

\- For carrier frequencies within FR1 larger than 3 GHz,
![](media/image5.wmf).

\- For operation with shared spectrum channel access, as described in
\[15, TS 37.213\], $n = 0,\ 1,\ 2,\ 3,\ 4$*.*

\- Case B - 30 kHz SCS: the first symbols of the candidate SS/PBCH
blocks have indexes ![](media/image6.wmf). For carrier frequencies
smaller than or equal to 3 GHz, ![](media/image7.wmf). For carrier
frequencies within FR1 larger than 3 GHz, ![](media/image4.wmf).

\- Case C - 30 kHz SCS: the first symbols of the candidate SS/PBCH
blocks have indexes ![](media/image8.wmf).

\- For operation without shared spectrum channel access

\- For paired spectrum operation

\- For carrier frequencies smaller than or equal to 3 GHz,
![](media/image4.wmf). For carrier frequencies within FR1 larger than 3
GHz, ![](media/image5.wmf).

\- For unpaired spectrum operation

\- For carrier frequencies smaller than 1.88 GHz, ![](media/image4.wmf).
For carrier frequencies within FR1 equal to or larger than 1.88 GHz,
![](media/image5.wmf).

\- For operation with shared spectrum channel access,
$n = 0,\ 1,\ 2,\ 3,\ 4,\ 5,\ 6,\ 7,\ 8,\ 9$*.*

\- Case D - 120 kHz SCS: the first symbols of the candidate SS/PBCH
blocks have indexes ![](media/image6.wmf). For carrier frequencies
within FR2,
$n = 0,\ 1,\ 2,\ 3,\ 5,\ 6,\ 7,\ 8,\ 10,\ 11,\ 12,\ 13,\ 15,\ 16,\ 17,\ 18$.

\- Case E - 240 kHz SCS: the first symbols of the candidate SS/PBCH
blocks have indexes ![](media/image9.wmf). For carrier frequencies
within FR2, $n = 0,\ 1,\ 2,\ 3,\ 5,\ 6,\ 7,\ 8$.

From the above cases, if the SCS of SS/PBCH blocks is not provided by
*ssbSubcarrierSpacing*, the applicable cases for a cell depend on a
respective frequency band, as provided in \[8-1, TS 38.101-1\] and
\[8-2, TS 38.101-2\]. A same case applies for all SS/PBCH blocks on the
cell. If a 30 kHz SS/PBCH block SCS is indicated by
*ssbSubcarrierSpacing*, Case B applies for frequency bands with only 15
kHz SS/PBCH block SCS as specified in \[8-1, TS 38.101-1\], and the case
specified for 30 kHz SS/PBCH block SCS in \[8-1, TS 38.101-1\] applies
for frequency bands with 30 kHz SS/PBCH block SCS or both 15 kHz and 30
kHz SS/PBCH block SCS as specified in \[8-1, TS 38.101-1\]. For a UE
configured to operate with carrier aggregation over a set of cells in a
frequency band of FR2 or with frequency-contiguous carrier aggregation
over a set of cells in a frequency band of FR1, if the UE is provided
SCS values by *ssbSubcarrierSpacing* for receptions of SS/PBCH blocks on
any cells from the set of cells, the UE expects the SCS values to be
same.

The candidate SS/PBCH blocks in a half frame are indexed in an ascending
order in time from 0 to ${\overline{L}}_{\max} - 1$*, where*
${\overline{L}}_{\max}$ is determined according to SS/PBCH block
patterns for Cases A through E. $L_{\max}$ is a maximum number of
SS/PBCH block indexes in a cell, and the maximum number of transmitted
SS/PBCH blocks within a half frame is $L_{\max}$.

*- For* operation without shared spectrum channel access,
$L_{\max} = {\overline{L}}_{\max}\ $

\- For operation with shared spectrum channel access, $L_{\max} = 8$ for
${\overline{L}}_{\max} = 10$ and 15 kHz SCS of SS/PBCH blocks and for
${\overline{L}}_{\max} = 20$ and 30 kHz SCS of SS/PBCH blocks

For ${\overline{L}}_{\max} = 4$, a UE determines the 2 LSB bits of a
candidate SS/PBCH block index per half frame from a one-to-one mapping
with an index of the DM-RS sequence transmitted in the PBCH as described
in \[4, TS 38.211\].

For ${\overline{L}}_{\max} > 4$, a UE determines the 3 LSB bits of a
candidate SS/PBCH block index per half frame from a one-to-one mapping
with an index of the DM-RS sequence transmitted in the PBCH as described
in \[4, TS 38.211\]

\- for ${\overline{L}}_{\max} = 10$, the UE determines the 1 MSB bit of
the candidate SS/PBCH block index from PBCH payload bit
${\bar{a}}_{\bar{A} + 7}$ as described in \[5, TS 38.212\]

\- for ${\overline{L}}_{\max} = 20$, the UE determines the 2 MSB bits of
the candidate SS/PBCH block index from PBCH payload bits
${\bar{a}}_{\bar{A} + 6},{\bar{a}}_{\bar{A} + 7}$ as described in \[5,
TS 38.212\]

\- for ${\overline{L}}_{\max} = 64$, the UE determines the 3 MSB bits of
the candidate SS/PBCH block index from PBCH payload bits
${\bar{a}}_{\bar{A} + 5},{\bar{a}}_{\bar{A} + 6},{\bar{a}}_{\bar{A} + 7}$
as described in \[5, TS 38.212\]

A UE can be provided per serving cell by *ssb-periodicityServingCell* a
periodicity of the half frames for reception of the SS/PBCH blocks for
the serving cell. If the UE is not configured a periodicity of the half
frames for receptions of the SS/PBCH blocks, the UE assumes a
periodicity of a half frame. A UE assumes that the periodicity is same
for all SS/PBCH blocks in the serving cell.

For initial cell selection, a UE may assume that half frames with
SS/PBCH blocks occur with a periodicity of 2 frames.

For operation without shared spectrum channel access, an SS/PBCH block
index is same as a candidate SS/PBCH block index.

For operation with shared spectrum channel access, a UE assumes that
transmission of SS/PBCH blocks in a half frame is within a discovery
burst transmission window that starts from the first symbol of the first
slot in a half-frame. The UE can be provided per serving cell by
*discoveryBurstWindowLength* a duration of the discovery burst
transmission window. If *discoveryBurstWindowLength* is not provided,
the UE assumes that the duration of the discovery burst transmission
window is a half frame. For a serving cell, the UE assumes that a
periodicity of the discovery burst transmission window is same as a
periodicity of half frames for receptions of SS/PBCH blocks in the
serving cell. The UE assumes that one or more SS/PBCH blocks indicated
by *ssb-PositionsInBurst* may be transmitted within the discovery burst
transmission window and have candidate SS/PBCH blocks indexes
corresponding to SS/PBCH block indexes provided by
*ssb-PositionsInBurst*. If MSB $k$, $k \geq 1$, of
*ssb-PositionsInBurst* is set to 1, the UE assumes that SS/PBCH block(s)
within the discovery burst transmission window with candidate SS/PBCH
block index(es) corresponding to SS/PBCH block index equal to $k - 1$
may be transmitted; if MSB $k$ is set to 0, the UE assumes that the
SS/PBCH block(s) are not transmitted.

For operation with shared spectrum channel access, a UE assumes that
SS/PBCH blocks in a serving cell that are within a same discovery burst
transmission window or across discovery burst transmission windows are
quasi co-located with respect to average gain, quasi co-location
\'typeA\' and \'typeD\' properties, when applicable \[6, TS 38.214\], if
a value of
$\left( N_{\text{DM} - \text{RS}}^{\text{PBCH}}\text{mod}N_{\text{SSB}}^{\text{QCL}} \right)$
is same among the SS/PBCH blocks.
$N_{\text{DM} - \text{RS}}^{\text{PBCH}}$ is an index of a DM-RS
sequence transmitted in a PBCH of a corresponding SS/PBCH block, and
$N_{\text{SSB}}^{\text{QCL}}$ is either provided by *ssb-PositionQCL*
or, if *ssb-PositionQCL* is not provided, obtained from a *MIB* provided
by a SS/PBCH block according to Table 4.1-1 with $k_{\text{SSB}} < 24$
\[4, TS 38.211\]. *subCarrierSpacingCommon* indicates SCS of RMSI only
for the case of operation without shared spectrum channel access. The UE
can determine an SS/PBCH block index according to
$\left( N_{\text{DM} - \text{RS}}^{\text{PBCH}}\text{mod}N_{\text{SSB}}^{\text{QCL}} \right)$,
or according to
$\left( \overline{i}\ \text{mod}N_{\text{SSB}}^{\text{QCL}} \right)$
where $\overline{i}$ is the candidate SS/PBCH block index. The UE
assumes that within a discovery burst transmission window, a number of
transmitted SS/PBCH blocks on a serving cell is not larger than
$N_{\text{SSB}}^{\text{QCL}}$ and a number of transmitted SS/PBCH blocks
with a same SS/PBCH block index is not larger than one.

*subCarrierSpacingCommon* and LSB of *ssb-SubcarrierOffset* to
$\mathbf{N}_{\mathbf{\text{SSB}}}^{\mathbf{\text{QCL}}}$

  scs15or60                   1                               2

  scs30or120                  1                               8

Upon detection of a SS/PBCH block, the UE determines from *MIB* that a
CORESET for Type0-PDCCH CSS set, as described in clause 13, is present
if $k_{\text{SSB}} < 24$ \[4, TS 38.211\] for FR1 or if
$k_{\text{SSB}} < 12$ for FR2. The UE determines from *MIB* that a
CORESET for Type0-PDCCH CSS set is not present if $k_{\text{SSB}} > 23$
for FR1 or if $k_{\text{SSB}} > 11$ for FR2; the CORESET for Type0-PDCCH
CSS set may be provided by *PDCCH-ConfigCommon*.

For a serving cell without transmission of SS/PBCH blocks, a UE acquires
time and frequency synchronization with the serving cell based on
receptions of SS/PBCH blocks on the PCell, or on the PSCell, or on an
SCell if applicable as described in \[10, TS 38.133\], of the cell group
for the serving cell.

4.2 Transmission timing adjustments
-----------------------------------

A UE can be provided a value ![](media/image10.wmf) of a timing advance
offset for a serving cell by *n-TimingAdvanceOffset* for the serving
cell. If the UE is not provided *n-TimingAdvanceOffset* for a serving
cell, the UE determines a default value ![](media/image11.wmf) of the
timing advance offset for the serving cell as described in \[10, TS
38.133\].

If a UE is configured with two UL carriers for a serving cell, a same
timing advance offset value ![](media/image11.wmf) applies to both
carriers.

Upon reception of a timing advance command for a TAG, the UE adjusts
uplink timing for PUSCH/SRS/PUCCH transmission on all the serving cells
in the TAG based on a value ![](media/image11.wmf) that the UE expects
to be same for all the serving cells in the TAG and based on the
received timing advance command where the uplink timing for
PUSCH/SRS/PUCCH transmissions is the same for all the serving cells in
the TAG.

For a band with synchronous contiguous intra-band EN-DC in a band
combination with non-applicable maximum transmit timing difference
requirements as described in Note 1 of Table 7.5.3-1 of \[10, TS
38.133\], if the UE indicates *ul-TimingAlignmentEUTRA-NR* as
\'required\' and uplink transmission timing based on timing adjustment
indication for a TAG from MCG and a TAG from SCG are determined to be
different by the UE, the UE adjusts the transmission timing for
PUSCH/SRS/PUCCH transmission on all serving cells part of the band with
the synchronous contiguous intra-band EN-DC based on timing adjustment
indication for a TAG from a serving cell in MCG in the band. The UE is
not expected to transmit a PUSCH/SRS/PUCCH in one CG when the
PUSCH/SRS/PUCCH is overlapping in time, even partially, with random
access preamble transmitted in another CG.

For a SCS of ![](media/image12.wmf) kHz, the timing advance command for
a TAG indicates the change of the uplink timing relative to the current
uplink timing for the TAG in multiples of ![](media/image13.wmf). The
start timing of the random access preamble is described in \[4, TS
38.211\].

A timing advance command \[11, TS 38.321\] in case of random access
response or in an absolute timing advance command MAC CE,
![](media/image14.wmf), for a TAG indicates ![](media/image15.wmf)
values by index values of ![](media/image16.wmf) = 0, 1, 2, \..., 3846,
where an amount of the time alignment for the TAG with SCS of
![](media/image17.wmf) kHz is ![](media/image18.wmf).
![](media/image15.wmf) is defined in \[4, TS 38.211\] and is relative to
the SCS of the first uplink transmission from the UE after the reception
of the random access response or absolute timing advance command MAC CE.

In other cases, a timing advance command \[11, TS 38.321\],
![](media/image16.wmf), for a TAG indicates adjustment of a current
![](media/image15.wmf) value, ![](media/image19.wmf), to the new
![](media/image15.wmf) value, ![](media/image20.wmf), by index values of
![](media/image16.wmf) = 0, 1, 2,\..., 63, where for a SCS of
![](media/image21.wmf) kHz, ![](media/image22.wmf).

If a UE has multiple active UL BWPs, as described in clause 12, in a
same TAG, including UL BWPs in two UL carriers of a serving cell, the
timing advance command value is relative to the largest SCS of the
multiple active UL BWPs. The applicable ![](media/image23.wmf) value for
an UL BWP with lower SCS may be rounded to align with the timing advance
granularity for the UL BWP with the lower SCS while satisfying the
timing advance accuracy requirements in \[10, TS 38.133\].

Adjustment of an ![](media/image15.wmf) value by a positive or a
negative amount indicates advancing or delaying the uplink transmission
timing for the TAG by a corresponding amount, respectively.

For a timing advance command received on uplink slot
![](media/image24.wmf) and for a transmission other than a PUSCH
scheduled by a RAR UL grant or a fallbackRAR UL grant as described in
clause 8.2A or 8.3, or a PUCCH with HARQ-ACK information in response to
a successRAR as described in clause 8.2A, the corresponding adjustment
of the uplink transmission timing applies from the beginning of uplink
slot ![](media/image25.wmf) where ![](media/image26.wmf),
![](media/image27.wmf) is a time duration in msec of
![](media/image28.wmf) symbols corresponding to a PDSCH processing time
for UE processing capability 1 when additional PDSCH DM-RS is
configured, ![](media/image29.wmf) is a time duration in msec of
![](media/image30.wmf) symbols corresponding to a PUSCH preparation time
for UE processing capability 1 \[6, TS 38.214\], ![](media/image31.wmf)
is the maximum timing advance value in msec that can be provided by a TA
command field of 12 bits, ![](media/image32.wmf) is the number of slots
per subframe, and ![](media/image33.wmf) is the subframe duration of 1
msec. ![](media/image28.wmf) and ![](media/image30.wmf) are determined
with respect to the minimum SCS among the SCSs of all configured UL BWPs
for all uplink carriers in the TAG and of all configured DL BWPs for the
corresponding downlink carriers. For ![](media/image34.wmf), the UE
assumes ![](media/image35.wmf) \[6, TS 38.214\]. Slot
![](media/image36.wmf) and ![](media/image32.wmf) are determined with
respect to the minimum SCS among the SCSs of all configured UL BWPs for
all uplink carriers in the TAG. ![](media/image37.wmf) is determined
with respect to the minimum SCS among the SCSs of all configured UL BWPs
for all uplink carriers in the TAG and for all configured initial UL
BWPs provided by *initialUplinkBWP*. The uplink slot
![](media/image24.wmf) is the last slot among uplink slot(s) overlapping
with the slot(s) of PDSCH reception assuming $T_{\text{TA}} = 0$, where
the PDSCH provides the timing advance command and $T_{\text{TA}}$ is
defined in \[4, TS 38.211\].

If a UE changes an active UL BWP between a time of a timing advance
command reception and a time of applying a corresponding adjustment for
the uplink transmission timing, the UE determines the timing advance
command value based on the SCS of the new active UL BWP. If the UE
changes an active UL BWP after applying an adjustment for the uplink
transmission timing, the UE assumes a same absolute timing advance
command value before and after the active UL BWP change.

If the received downlink timing changes and is not compensated or is
only partly compensated by the uplink timing adjustment without timing
advance command as described in \[10, TS 38.133\], the UE changes
![](media/image15.wmf) accordingly.

If two adjacent slots overlap due to a TA command, the latter slot is
reduced in duration relative to the former slot.

4.3 Timing for secondary cell activation / deactivation
-------------------------------------------------------

With reference to slots for PUCCH transmissions, when a UE receives in a
PDSCH an activation command \[11, TS 38.321\] for a secondary cell
ending in slot *n*, the UE applies the corresponding actions in \[11, TS
38.321\] no later than the minimum requirement defined in \[10, TS
38.133\] and no earlier than slot ![](media/image38.wmf), except for the
following:

\- the actions related to CSI reporting on a serving cell that is active
in slot ![](media/image39.wmf)

\- the actions related to the *sCellDeactivationTimer* associated with
the secondary cell \[11, TS 38.321\] that the UE applies in slot
![](media/image39.wmf)

\- the actions related to CSI reporting on a serving cell which is not
active in slot ![](media/image39.wmf)that the UE applies in the earliest
slot after ![](media/image39.wmf) in which the serving cell is active.

The value of ![](media/image40.wmf) is
${m + 3\ N}_{\text{slot}}^{\text{subframe},\mu} + 1$ where
slot![](media/image41.png) *n*+*m* is a slot indicated for PUCCH
transmission with HARQ-ACK information for the PDSCH reception as
described in clause 9.2.3 and ![](media/image42.wmf) is a number of
slots per subframe for the SCS configuration ![](media/image43.wmf) of
the PUCCH transmission as defined in \[4, TS 38.211\].

With reference to slots for PUCCH transmissions, if a UE receives a
deactivation command \[11, TS 38.321\] for a secondary cell ending in
slot ![](media/image44.wmf), the UE applies the corresponding actions in
\[11, TS 38.321\] no later than the minimum requirement defined in \[10,
TS 38.133\]*, except* for the actions related to CSI reporting on an
activated serving cell which the UE applies in slot
![](media/image39.wmf)*.*

If *the sCellDeactivationTimer associated with the secondary cell
expires* in slot ![](media/image44.wmf), the UE applies the
corresponding actions in \[11, TS 38.321\] no later than the minimum
requirement defined in \[10, TS 38.133\]*, except* for the actions
related to CSI reporting on an activated serving cell which the UE
applies in the first slot that is after slot ![](media/image45.wmf)
where ![](media/image46.wmf) is the SCS configuration for PDSCH
reception on the secondary cell.

5 Radio link monitoring
=======================

The downlink radio link quality of the primary cell is monitored by a UE
for the purpose of indicating out-of-sync/in-sync status to higher
layers. The UE is not required to monitor the downlink radio link
quality in DL BWPs other than the active DL BWP, as described in clause
12, on the primary cell. If the active DL BWP is the initial DL BWP and
for SS/PBCH block and CORESET multiplexing pattern 2 or 3, as described
in clause 13, the UE is expected to perform RLM using the associated
SS/PBCH block when the associated SS/PBCH block index is provided by
*RadioLinkMonitoringRS*.

If the UE is configured with a SCG, as described in \[12, TS 38.331\],
and the parameter *rlf-TimersAndConstants* is provided by higher layers
and is not set to release, the downlink radio link quality of the PSCell
of the SCG is monitored by the UE for the purpose of indicating
out-of-sync/in-sync status to higher layers. The UE is not required to
monitor the downlink radio link quality in DL BWPs other than the active
DL BWP on the PSCell.

A UE can be configured for each DL BWP of a SpCell \[11, TS 38.321\]
with a set of resource indexes, through a corresponding set of
*RadioLinkMonitoringRS*, for radio link monitoring by
*failureDetectionResources*. The UE is provided either a CSI-RS resource
configuration index, by *csi-RS-Index*, or a SS/PBCH block index, by
*ssb-Index*. The UE can be configured with up to ![](media/image47.wmf)
*RadioLinkMonitoringRS* for link recovery procedures, as described in
clause 6, and for radio link monitoring. From the ![](media/image47.wmf)
*RadioLinkMonitoringRS*, up to ![](media/image48.wmf)
*RadioLinkMonitoringRS* can be used for radio link monitoring depending
on $L_{\max}\ $ as described in *Table 5-1, wherein* $L_{\max}$ is as
defined in *clause 4.1*, and up to two *RadioLinkMonitoringRS* can be
used for link recovery procedures.

For operation with shared spectrum channel access, when a UE is provided
a SS/PBCH block index by *ssb-Index*, the UE is expected to perform
radio link monitoring using SS/PBCH block(s) in the discovery burst
transmission window as described in clause 4.1, where the SS/PBCH
block(s) have candidate SS/PBCH block index(es) corresponding to SS/PBCH
block index provided by *ssb-Index*.

If the UE is not provided *RadioLinkMonitoringRS and the UE is provided
for PDCCH receptions TCI states that include one or more of a CSI-RS*

\- the UE uses for radio link monitoring the RS provided for the active
TCI state for PDCCH *reception* if the active TCI state for PDCCH
reception includes only one RS

\- if the active TCI state for PDCCH reception includes two RS, the UE
expects that one RS is configured with *qcl-Type* set to \'typeD\' \[6,
TS 38.214\] and the UE uses the RS configured with *qcl-Type* set to
\'typeD\' for radio link monitoring; the UE does not expect both RS to
be configured with *qcl-Type* set to \'typeD\'

\- the UE is not required to use for radio link monitoring an aperiodic
or semi-persistent RS

\- For ![](media/image49.wmf), the UE selects the ![](media/image48.wmf)
RS provided for active TCI states for PDCCH receptions in CORESETs
associated with the search space sets in an order from the shortest
monitoring periodicity. If more than one CORESETs are associated with
search space sets having same monitoring periodicity, the UE determines
the order of the CORESET from the highest CORESET index as described in
clause 10.1.

A UE does not expect to use more than ![](media/image50.wmf)
*RadioLinkMonitoringRS* for radio link monitoring when the UE is not
provided *RadioLinkMonitoringRS*.

Values of ![](media/image47.wmf) and ![](media/image50.wmf) for
different values of ![](media/image51.wmf) are given in Table 5-1.

Table 5-1: ![](media/image47.wmf) and ![](media/image50.wmf) as a
function of *maximum number* ![](media/image51.wmf) *of SS/PBCH blocks
per half frame*

  ![](media/image51.wmf)   ![](media/image47.wmf)   ![](media/image50.wmf)
  ------------------------ ------------------------ ------------------------
  4                        2                        2
  8                        6                        4
  64                       8                        8

For a CSI-RS resource configuration, *powerControlOffsetSS* is not
applicable and a UE expects to be provided only \'noCDM\' from
*cdm-Type,* only \'one\' and \'three\' from *density*, and only \'1
port\' from *nrofPorts* \[6, TS 38.214\].

If a UE is configured with multiple DL BWPs for a serving cell, the UE
performs RLM using the RS(s) corresponding to resource indexes provided
by *RadioLinkMonitoringRS* for the active DL BWP or, if
*RadioLinkMonitoringRS* is not provided for the active DL BWP, using the
RS(s) provided *for the active TCI state for PDCCH receptions* in
CORESETs on the active DL BWP.

In non-DRX mode operation, the physical layer in the UE assesses once
per indication period the radio link quality, evaluated over the
previous time period defined in \[10, TS 38.133\] against thresholds
(Q~out~ and Q~in~) configured by *rlmInSyncOutOfSyncThreshold*. The UE
determines the indication period as the maximum between the shortest
periodicity for radio link monitoring resources *and 10 msec.*

In DRX mode operation, the physical layer in the UE assesses once per
indication period the radio link quality, evaluated over the previous
time period defined in \[10, TS 38.133\], against thresholds (Q~out~ and
Q~in~) provided by *rlmInSyncOutOfSyncThreshold*. The UE determines the
indication period as the maximum between the shortest periodicity for
radio link monitoring resources *and the DRX period.*

The physical layer in the UE indicates, in frames where the radio link
quality is assessed, out-of-sync to higher layers when the radio link
quality is worse than the threshold Q~out~ for all resources in the set
of resources for radio link monitoring. When the radio link quality is
better than the threshold Q~in~ for any resource in the set of resources
for radio link monitoring, the physical layer in the UE indicates, in
frames where the radio link quality is assessed, in-sync to higher
layers.

6 Link recovery procedures
==========================

A UE can be provided, for each BWP of a serving cell, a set
![](media/image52.wmf) *of periodic CSI-RS resource configuration
indexes by failureDetectionResourcesToAddModList and* a set
![](media/image53.wmf) of periodic CSI-RS resource configuration indexes
and/or SS/PBCH block indexes by *candidateBeamRSList* or
*candidateBeamRSListExt or* *candidateBeamRSSCellList* for radio link
quality measurements on the BWP of the serving cell. If the UE is not
provided *by* *failureDetectionResourcesToAddModList* for a BWP of the
serving cell*, the UE determines the set* ![](media/image52.wmf) *to
include periodic CSI-RS resource configuration indexes with same values
as the RS indexes in the RS sets indicated by* *TCI-State* for
respective CORESETs that the UE uses for monitoring PDCCH and, if there
are two RS indexes in a TCI state, the set ![](media/image54.wmf)
includes RS indexes configured with *qcl-Type* set to \'typeD\' for the
corresponding TCI states. The UE expects the set ![](media/image54.wmf)
to include up to two RS indexes. The UE expects single port RS in the
*set* ![](media/image52.wmf)*.* The UE expects single-port or two-port
CSI-RS with frequency density equal to 1 or 3 REs per RB in the set
![](media/image55.wmf){width="0.19791666666666666in"
height="0.19791666666666666in"}.

The thresholds Q~out,LR~ and Q~in,LR~ correspond to the default value of
*rlmInSyncOutOfSyncThreshold*, as described in \[10, TS 38.133\] for
Q~out~, and to the value provided by *rsrp-ThresholdSSB or
rsrp-ThresholdBFR*, respectively.

The physical layer in the UE assesses the radio link quality according
to the set ![](media/image52.wmf) of resource configurations against the
threshold Q~out,LR~. For the set ![](media/image52.wmf)*, the UE*
assesses the radio link quality only according to *SS/PBCH blocks on the
PCell or the PSCell or* periodic *CSI-RS resource configurations that*
are quasi co-located, as described in \[6, TS 38.214\], with the DM-RS
of PDCCH receptions monitored by the UE. The UE applies the Q~in,LR~
threshold to the L1-RSRP measurement obtained from a SS/PBCH block. The
UE applies the Q~in,LR~ threshold to the L1-RSRP measurement obtained
for a CSI-RS resource after scaling a respective CSI-RS reception power
with a value provided by *powerControlOffsetSS*.

In non-DRX mode operation, the physical layer in the UE provides an
indication to higher layers when the radio link quality for all
corresponding resource configurations in the set ![](media/image52.wmf)
*that the UE uses to assess the radio link quality* is worse than the
threshold Q~out,LR~. The physical layer informs the higher layers when
the *radio link quality* is worse than the threshold Q~out,LR~ with a
periodicity determined by the maximum between the shortest periodicity
among the SS/PBCH blocks *on the PCell or the PSCell* and/or the
periodic CSI-RS configurations in the set ![](media/image52.wmf) *that
the UE uses to assess the radio link quality and 2 msec. In DRX mode
operation, the physical layer* provides an indication to higher layers
*when the radio link quality is worse than the threshold Q~out,LR~ with
a periodicity determined as described in \[10, TS 38.133\].*

For the PCell or the PSCell, upon request from higher layers, the UE
provides to higher layers the periodic CSI-RS configuration indexes
and/or SS/PBCH block indexes from the set ![](media/image53.wmf) *and
the corresponding L1-RSRP measurements that are larger than or equal to
the* Q~in,LR~ *threshold.*

For the SCell, upon request from higher layers, the UE indicates to
higher layers whether there is at least one periodic CSI-RS
configuration index or SS/PBCH block index from the set
![](media/image55.wmf){width="0.19791666666666666in"
height="0.19791666666666666in"} with corresponding L1-RSRP measurements
that is larger than or equal to the Q~in,LR~ threshold, and *provides*
the periodic CSI-RS configuration indexes and/or SS/PBCH block indexes
from the set ![](media/image55.wmf){width="0.19791666666666666in"
height="0.19791666666666666in"} *and the corresponding L1-RSRP
measurements that are larger than or equal to the* Q~in,LR~ *threshold,
if any.*

For the PCell or the PSCell, a UE can be provided a CORESET through a
link to a search space set provided by *recoverySearchSpaceId,* as
described in clause 10.1, for monitoring PDCCH in the CORESET. If the UE
is provided *recoverySearchSpaceId*, the UE does not expect to be
provided another search space set for monitoring PDCCH in the CORESET
associated with the search space set provided by
*recoverySearchSpaceId*.

For the PCell or the PSCell, the UE can be provided, by
*PRACH-ResourceDedicatedBFR*, a configuration for PRACH transmission as
described in clause 8.1. For PRACH transmission in slot
![](media/image44.wmf) and according to antenna port quasi co-location
parameters associated with periodic CSI-RS resource configuration or
with SS/PBCH block associated with index ![](media/image56.wmf)
*provided by higher layers* \[11, TS 38.321\], the UE monitors PDCCH in
a search space set provided by *recoverySearchSpaceId* for detection of
a DCI format with CRC scrambled by C-RNTI or MCS-C-RNTI starting from
slot ![](media/image57.wmf) within a window configured by
*BeamFailureRecoveryConfig. For PDCCH monitoring* in a search space set
provided by *recoverySearchSpaceId* *and for corresponding PDSCH
reception, the UE assumes the same antenna port quasi-collocation
parameters as the ones associated with* index ![](media/image56.wmf)
*until the UE receives by higher layers an activation for a TCI state or
any of the parameters tci-StatesPDCCH-ToAddList and/or
tci-StatesPDCCH-ToReleaseList.* After the UE detects a DCI format with
CRC scrambled by C-RNTI or MCS-C-RNTI in the search space set provided
by *recoverySearchSpaceId*, the UE continues to monitor PDCCH candidates
in the search space set provided by *recoverySearchSpaceId* until the UE
receives a MAC CE activation command for a TCI state or
*tci-StatesPDCCH-ToAddList and/or tci-StatesPDCCH-ToReleaseList.*

*For the PCell or the PSCell, after 28 symbols from a last symbol of* a
first PDCCH reception in a search space set provided by
*recoverySearchSpaceId* for which the UE detects a DCI format with CRC
scrambled by C-RNTI or MCS-C-RNTI *and* until the UE receives an
activation command for *PUCCH-SpatialRelationInfo* \[11, TS 38.321\] or
is provided *PUCCH-SpatialRelationInfo* for PUCCH resource(s), t*he UE
transmits a PUCCH on a same cell as the PRACH transmission using*

\- *a* same spatial filter as for the last PRACH transmission

\- *a* power determined as described in clause 7.2.1 with
![](media/image58.wmf), ![](media/image59.wmf), and
![](media/image60.wmf)

*For the PCell or the PSCell, after 28 symbols from a last symbol of a
first PDCCH reception in a search space set provided by
recoverySearchSpaceId where a UE detects a DCI format with CRC scrambled
by C-RNTI or MCS-C-RNTI, the UE assumes same antenna port
quasi-collocation parameters as the ones associated with index*
![](media/image56.wmf) *for PDCCH monitoring in a CORESET with index 0.*

*For the PCell or the PSCell, if BFR MAC CE \[11, TS 38.321\] is
transmitted in Msg3 or MsgA of contention based random access procedure,
and if a PUCCH resource is provided with PUCCH-SpatialRelationInfo,
after 28 symbols from the last symbol of the PDCCH reception that
determines the completion of the contention based random access
procedure as described in clause 5.1.4a or in clause 5.1.5 of \[11, TS
38.321\], the UE transmits the PUCCH on a same cell as the PRACH
transmission using*

\- a same spatial filter as for the last PRACH transmission

\- *a* power determined as described in clause 7.2.1 with
![](media/image61.wmf){width="0.3854166666666667in" height="0.21875in"},
![](media/image62.wmf){width="0.6145833333333334in"
height="0.22916666666666666in"}, and
![](media/image63.wmf){width="0.3020833333333333in"
height="0.19791666666666666in"}, where *q*~new~ is the SS/PBCH block
index selected for the last PRACH transmission.

A UE can be provided, by *schedulingRequestID-BFR-SCell, a configuration
for PUCCH transmission with a link recovery request (LRR) as described
in clause 9.2.4. The UE can transmit in a first PUSCH MAC CE providing
index(es) for at least corresponding SCell(s) with* *radio link quality*
worse than Q~out,LR~*, indication(s) of presence of* $q_{\text{new}}$
*for corresponding SCell(s), and* index(es) $q_{\text{new}}$ for a
periodic CSI-RS configuration or for a SS/PBCH block *provided by higher
layers, as described in* \[11, TS 38.321\]*, if any, for corresponding
SCell(s). After 28 symbols from a last symbol of a PDCCH reception with
a DCI format scheduling a PUSCH transmission with a same HARQ process
number as for the transmission of the first PUSCH and having a toggled
NDI field value, the UE*

\- monitors PDCCH in all CORESETs *on the SCell(s) indicated by the MAC
CE* using the *same antenna port quasi co-location parameters as the
ones associated with the corresponding index(es)* $q_{\text{new}}$*, if
any*

\- transmits PUCCH on a PUCCH-SCell using a same spatial domain filter
as the one corresponding to $q_{\text{new}}$*, if any,* for periodic
CSI-RS or SS/PBCH block reception, as described in clause 9.2.2, and
using a power determined as described in clause 7.2.1 with
$q_{\text{u}} = 0$, ${q_{\text{d}} = q}_{\text{new}}$, and $l = 0$*,*
*if*

\- *the UE is* provided *PUCCH-SpatialRelationInfo* for the PUCCH,

\- a PUCCH with the LRR was either not transmitted or was transmitted on
the PCell or the PSCell, and

\- the PUCCH-SCell is included in the SCell(s) indicated by the MAC-CE

where the SCS configuration for the 28 symbols is the smallest of the
SCS configurations of the active DL BWP for the PDCCH reception and of
the active DL BWP(s) of the at least one SCell.

7 Uplink Power control
======================

Uplink power control determines a power for PUSCH, PUCCH, SRS, and PRACH
transmissions.

*A UE does not expect to simultaneously maintain more than four pathloss
estimates per serving cell for all PUSCH/PUCCH/SRS transmissions as
described in clauses 7.1.1, 7.2.1, and 7.3.1,* except for SRS
transmissions configured by *SRS-PosResourceSet* as described in clause
7.3.1*. If the UE is provided a number of RS resources for pathloss
estimation for PUSCH/PUCCH/SRS transmissions that is larger than 4, the
UE maintains for pathloss estimation RS resources corresponding to* RS
resource indexes $q_{d}$ *as described in clauses 7.1.1, 7.2.1, and
7.3.1.* *If an RS resource updated by MAC CE, as described in clauses
7.1.1, 7.2.1 and 7.3.1, is one from the RS resources the UE maintains
for pathloss estimation for PUSCH/PUCCH/SRS transmissions*, the UE
applies the pathloss estimation based on the RS resources starting from
the first slot that is after slot
$k + 3 \bullet N_{\text{slot}}^{subframe,\ \ \mu}$ where $k$ is the slot
where the UE would transmit a PUCCH or PUSCH with HARQ-ACK information
for the PDSCH providing the MAC CE and $\mu\text{\ \ }$is the SCS
configuration for the PUCCH or PUSCH, respectively*.*

*A PUSCH/PUCCH/SRS/PRACH transmission occasion* $i$ *is defined by a*
slot index $n_{s,f}^{\mu}$ within a frame with system frame number
$\text{SFN}$, a first symbol $S$ within the slot, and a number of
consecutive symbols $L$. For a PUSCH transmission with repetition Type
B, a PUSCH transmission occasion is a nominal repetition \[6, TS
38.214\].

7.1 Physical uplink shared channel
----------------------------------

For a PUSCH transmission on active UL BWP $\text{\ b}$*, as described in
clause 12, of* carrier $f$ *of* serving cell $c$*,* a UE first
calculates a linear value
${\widehat{P}}_{\text{PUSCH},b,f,c}(i,j,q_{d},l)$ *of the* transmit
power $P_{\text{PUSCH},b,f,c}(i,j,q_{d},l)$*, with parameters as defined
in clause 7.1.1. For a* PUSCH transmission scheduled by a DCI format
other than DCI format 0\_0, or configured by *ConfiguredGrantConfig* or
*semiPersistentOnPUSCH*, if *txConfig* in *PUSCH-Config* is set to

*using* parameter set configuration *with index* ![](media/image67.wmf)
*and* PUSCH power control adjustment state with index
![](media/image68.wmf), the UE determines the PUSCH transmission power
![](media/image69.wmf) in PUSCH transmission occasion
![](media/image70.wmf) as

![](media/image71.wmf) \[dBm\]

where,

\- If the UE is provided by *SRI-PUSCH-PowerControl* more than one
values of *p0-PUSCH-AlphaSetId* and if a DCI format scheduling the PUSCH
transmission includes an SRI field, the UE obtains a mapping from
*sri-PUSCH-PowerControlId* in *SRI-PUSCH-PowerControl* between a set of
values for the SRI field in the DCI format \[5, TS 38.212\] and a set of
indexes provided by *p0-PUSCH-AlphaSetId* that map to a set of
*P0-PUSCH-AlphaSet* values and determines the value of

\- If the UE is provided *SRI-PUSCH-PowerControl* and more than one
values of *p0-PUSCH-AlphaSetId*, and if a DCI format scheduling the
PUSCH transmission includes an SRI field, the UE obtains a mapping from
*sri-PUSCH-PowerControlId* in *SRI-PUSCH-PowerControl* between a set of
values for the SRI field in the DCI format \[5, TS 38.212\] and a set of
indexes provided by *p0-PUSCH-AlphaSetId* that map to a set of
*P0-PUSCH-AlphaSet* values and determines the values of
![](media/image103.wmf) from the *p0-PUSCH-AlphaSetId* value that is
mapped to the SRI field value

\- If the PUSCH transmission except for the PUSCH retransmission
corresponding to a RAR UL grant is scheduled by a DCI format that does

calculated by the UE using reference signal (RS) index $q_{d}$ for the
active DL BWP, as described in clause 12, *of carrier* $f$ *of* serving
cell $c$

\- If the UE is not provided *PUSCH-PathlossReferenceRS* and
*enableDefaultBeamPL-ForSRS*, or before the UE is provided dedicated
higher layer parameters*, the UE calculates* ![](media/image107.wmf)
*using a RS resource from an SS/PBCH block* with same SS/PBCH block
index as the one *the UE uses to obtain MIB*

\- If the UE is configured with a number of RS resource indexes, up to
the value of *maxNrofPUSCH-PathlossReferenceRSs*, and a respective set
of RS configurations for the number of RS resource indexes by
*PUSCH-PathlossReferenceRS*, the set of RS resource indexes can include

values of *PUSCH-PathlossReferenceRS-Id*, the UE obtains a mapping from
*sri-PUSCH-PowerControlId* in *SRI-PUSCH-PowerControl* between a set of
values for the SRI field in a DCI format scheduling the PUSCH
transmission and a set of *PUSCH-PathlossReferenceRS-Id* values and
determines the RS resource index $q_{d}$ from the value of
*PUSCH-PathlossReferenceRS-Id* that is mapped to the SRI field value
where the RS resource is either on serving cell $c$ or, if provided, on
a serving cell indicated by a value of *pathlossReferenceLinking*

\- If the PUSCH transmission is scheduled by DCI format 0\_0, and if the
UE is provided a spatial setting by *PUCCH-SpatialRelationInfo* for a
PUCCH resource with a lowest index for active UL BWP $b$ of each carrier
$f$ *and* serving cell $c$, as described in clause 9.2.2, *the UE uses

BWP of the serving cell $c$

\- For a PUSCH transmission configured by *ConfiguredGrantConfig,* if
*rrc-ConfiguredUplinkGrant* is included in *ConfiguredGrantConfig*, a RS
resource index ![](media/image108.wmf) is provided by a value of
*pathlossReferenceIndex* included in *rrc-ConfiguredUplinkGrant* where
the RS resource is either on serving cell ![](media/image66.wmf) or, if

resource index ![](media/image108.wmf) from a value of
*PUSCH-PathlossReferenceRS-Id* that is mapped to a SRI field value in a
DCI format activating the PUSCH transmission. If the DCI format
activating the PUSCH transmission does not include an SRI field, the UE
determines a RS resource index ![](media/image108.wmf) with a respective
*PUSCH-PathlossReferenceRS-Id* value being equal to zero where the RS

### 7.2.1 UE behaviour

If a UE transmits a PUCCH on active UL BWP ![](media/image92.wmf) of
carrier ![](media/image65.wmf) in the primary cell
![](media/image66.wmf) *using* PUCCH power control adjustment state with
index ![](media/image68.wmf), the UE determines the PUCCH transmission
power ![](media/image185.wmf) in PUCCH transmission occasion
![](media/image70.wmf) as

![](media/image186.wmf) \[dBm\]

where

\- ![](media/image187.wmf) is the UE configured maximum output power
defined in \[8-1, TS 38.101-1\], \[8-2, TS 38.101-2\] and \[8-3, TS
38.101-3\] for carrier ![](media/image65.wmf) *of* primary cell
![](media/image66.wmf) in PUCCH transmission occasion
![](media/image73.wmf)

\- ![](media/image188.wmf) is a parameter composed of the sum of a
component ![](media/image189.wmf), provided by *p0-nominal*, or
![](media/image190.wmf) dBm if *p0-nominal* is not provided, for carrier
![](media/image65.wmf) of primary cell ![](media/image66.wmf) and, if
provided, a component ![](media/image191.wmf) provided by
*p0-PUCCH-Value* in *P0-PUCCH* for active UL BWP ![](media/image92.wmf)
of carrier ![](media/image65.wmf) of primary cell
![](media/image66.wmf), where ![](media/image192.wmf).
![](media/image193.wmf) is a size for a set of ![](media/image194.wmf)
values provided by *maxNrofPUCCH-P0-PerSet*. The set of
![](media/image194.wmf) values is provided by *p0-Set*. If *p0-Set* is
not provided to the UE, ![](media/image195.wmf), ![](media/image192.wmf)

\- If the UE is provided *PUCCH-SpatialRelationInfo*, the UE obtains a
mapping, by an index provided by *p0-PUCCH-Id*, between a set of
*pucch-SpatialRelationInfoId* values and a set of *p0-PUCCH-Value*
values. If the UE is provided more than one values for
*pucch-SpatialRelationInfoId* and the UE receives *an* activation
command \[11, TS 38.321\] indicating a value of
*pucch-SpatialRelationInfoId*, the UE determines the *p0-PUCCH-Value*
value through the link to a corresponding *p0-PUCCH-Id* index. The UE
applies the activation command in the first slot that is after slot
![](media/image196.wmf) where ![](media/image197.wmf) is the slot where
the UE would transmit a PUCCH with HARQ-ACK information for the PDSCH
providing the activation command and ![](media/image198.wmf) is the SCS
configuration for the PUCCH

\- If the UE is not provided *PUCCH-SpatialRelationInfo*, the UE obtains
the *p0-PUCCH-Value* value from the *P0-PUCCH* with *p0-PUCCH-Id* value
equal to the minimum *p0-PUCCH-Id* value in *p0-Set*

\- ![](media/image199.wmf) is a bandwidth of the PUCCH resource
assignment expressed in number of resource blocks for PUCCH transmission
occasion ![](media/image105.wmf) on active UL BWP ![](media/image92.wmf)
of carrier ![](media/image65.wmf) *of* primary cell
![](media/image66.wmf) and ![](media/image106.wmf) is a SCS
configuration defined in \[4, TS 38.211\]

\- ![](media/image107.wmf)is a downlink pathloss estimate in dB
calculated by the UE using RS resource index ![](media/image108.wmf) as
described in clause 7.1.1 for the active DL BWP ![](media/image92.wmf)
of carrier ![](media/image65.wmf) of the primary cell
![](media/image66.wmf) as described in clause 12

\- If the UE is not provided *pathlossReferenceRSs* or before the UE is
provided dedicated higher layer parameters*, the UE calculates*
![](media/image107.wmf) using *a RS resource obtained from an SS/PBCH
block* with same SS/PBCH block index as the one *the UE uses to obtain
MIB*

\- If the UE is provided a number of RS resource indexes, the UE
calculates ![](media/image107.wmf) using RS resource with index
![](media/image108.wmf), where ![](media/image200.wmf).
![](media/image201.wmf) is a size for a set of RS resources provided by
*maxNrofPUCCH-PathlossReferenceRSs*. The set of RS resources is provided
by *pathlossReferenceRSs*. The set of RS resources can include one or
both of a set of SS/PBCH block indexes, each provided by *ssb-Index* in
*PUCCH-PathlossReferenceRS* when a value of a corresponding
*pucch-PathlossReferenceRS-Id* maps to a SS/PBCH block index, and a set
of CSI-RS resource indexes, each provided by *csi-RS-Index* when a value
of a corresponding *pucch-PathlossReferenceRS-Id* maps to a CSI-RS
resource index. The UE identifies a RS resource in the set of RS
resources to correspond either to a SS/PBCH block index or to a CSI-RS
resource index as provided by *pucch-PathlossReferenceRS-Id* in
*PUCCH-PathlossReferenceRS*

\- If the UE is provided *pathlossReferenceRSs* and
*PUCCH-SpatialRelationInfo*, the UE obtains a mapping, by indexes
provided by corresponding values of *pucch-PathlossReferenceRS-Id*,
between a set of *pucch-SpatialRelationInfoId* values and a set of
*referenceSignal* values provided by *PUCCH-PathlossReferenceRS*. If the
UE is provided more than one values for *pucch-SpatialRelationInfoId*
and the UE receives *an* activation command \[11, TS 38.321\] indicating
a value of *pucch-SpatialRelationInfoId*, the UE determines the
*referenceSignal* value in *PUCCH-PathlossReferenceRS* through the link
to a corresponding *pucch-PathlossReferenceRS-Id* index. The UE applies
the activation command in the first slot that is after slot
![](media/image196.wmf) where ![](media/image197.wmf) is the slot where
the UE would transmit a PUCCH with HARQ-ACK information for the PDSCH
providing the activation command and ![](media/image198.wmf) is the SCS
configuration for the PUCCH

\- If *PUCCH-SpatialRelationInfo* includes *servingCellId* indicating a
serving cell, the UE receives the RS for resource index
![](media/image108.wmf) on the active DL BWP of the serving cell

\- If the UE is provided *pathlossReferenceRSs* and is not provided
*PUCCH-SpatialRelationInfo*, the UE obtains the *referenceSignal* value
in *PUCCH-PathlossReferenceRS* from the *pucch-PathlossReferenceRS-Id*
with index 0 in *PUCCH-PathlossReferenceRS* where the RS resource is
either on the primary cell or, if provided, on a serving cell indicated
by a value of *pathlossReferenceLinking*

\- If the UE

\- is not provided *pathlossReferenceRSs*, and

\- is not provided *PUCCH-SpatialRelationInfo,* and

\- is provided *enableDefaultBeamPL-ForPUCCH*, and

\- is not provided *coresetPoolIndex* value of 1 for any CORESET, or is
provided *coresetPoolIndex* value of 1 for all CORESETs,
in *ControlResourceSet *and no codepoint of a TCI field, if any, in a
DCI format of any search space set maps to two TCI states \[5, TS
38.212\]

the UE determines a RS resource index $q_{d}$ providing a periodic RS
resource configured with *qcl-Type* set to \'typeD\' in the TCI state or
the QCL assumption of a CORESET with the lowest index in the active DL
BWP of the primary cell. For a PUCCH transmission over multiple slots, a
same $q_{d}$ applies to the PUCCH transmission in each of the multiple
slots.

\- The parameter ![](media/image202.wmf) is a value of *deltaF-PUCCH-f0*
for PUCCH format 0, *deltaF-PUCCH-f1* for PUCCH format 1,
*deltaF-PUCCH-f2* for PUCCH format 2, *deltaF-PUCCH-f3* for PUCCH format
3, and *deltaF-PUCCH-f4* for PUCCH format 4, if provided; otherwise
$\Delta_{\text{F\_PUCCH}}\left( F \right) = 0$**.**

### 7.3.1 UE behaviour

If a UE transmits SRS based on a configuration by *SRS-ResourceSet* on
active UL BWP ![](media/image92.wmf) of carrier ![](media/image65.wmf)
*of* serving cell ![](media/image66.wmf) *using* SRS power control
adjustment state with index ![](media/image68.wmf), the UE determines
the SRS transmission power ![](media/image274.wmf) in SRS transmission
occasion ![](media/image70.wmf) as

![](media/image275.wmf) \[dBm\]

where,

\- ![](media/image276.wmf) is the UE configured maximum output power
defined in \[8, TS 38.101-1\], \[8-2, TS 38.101-2\] and \[TS 38.101-3\]
for carrier ![](media/image65.wmf) *of* serving cell

*of* serving cell ![](media/image66.wmf) and ![](media/image106.wmf) is
a SCS configuration defined in \[4, TS 38.211\]

\- ![](media/image280.wmf) is provided by *alpha* for active UL BWP

cell ![](media/image66.wmf) *and* SRS resource set
![](media/image278.wmf)

\- ![](media/image281.wmf) is a downlink pathloss estimate in dB
calculated by the UE using RS resource index $q_{d}$ as described in
clause 7.1.1 for the active DL BWP *of* serving cell $c$ and SRS
resource set $q_{s}$ \[6, TS 38.214\]. The RS resource index $q_{d}$ is
provided by *pathlossReferenceRS* associated with the SRS resource set
$q_{s}$ and is either an *ssb-Index* providing a SS/PBCH block index or
a *csi-RS-Index* providing a CSI-RS resource index. If the UE is
provided ***enablePL-RS-UpdateForPUSCH-SRS***, a MAC CE \[11, TS
38.321\] can provide by *SRS-PathlossReferenceRS-Id* a corresponding RS
resource index $q_{d}$ for aperiodic or semi-persistent SRS resource set
$q_{s}$

\- If the UE is not provided *pathlossReferenceRS* or
*SRS-PathlossReferenceRS-Id*, or before the UE is provided dedicated
higher layer parameters*, the UE calculates* ![](media/image281.wmf)
using *a RS resource obtained from an SS/PBCH block* with same SS/PBCH
block index as the one *the UE uses to obtain MIB*

\- If the UE is provided *pathlossReferenceLinking*, the RS resource is
on a serving cell indicated by a value of *pathlossReferenceLinking*

\- If the UE

\- is not provided *pathlossReferenceRS* or
*SRS-PathlossReferenceRS-Id*,

\- is not provided *spatialRelationInfo,* and

\- is provided *enableDefaultBeamPL-ForSRS, and*

\- is not provided *coresetPoolIndex* value of 1 for any CORESET, or is

format of any search space set maps to two TCI states \[5, TS 38.212\]

the UE determines a RS resource index providing a periodic RS resource
configured with *qcl-Type* set to \'typeD\' in

\- the TCI state or the QCL assumption of a CORESET with the lowest
index in the active DL BWP, if CORESETs are provided in the active DL
BWP of serving cell $c$

\- ![](media/image282.wmf), where ![](media/image283.wmf) is the current
PUSCH power control adjustment state as described in clause 7.1.1, if
*srs-PowerControlAdjustmentStates* indicates a same power control
adjustment state for SRS transmissions and PUSCH transmissions; or

\- ![](media/image284.wmf) if the UE is not configured for PUSCH
transmissions on active UL BWP ![](media/image92.wmf) of carrier
![](media/image65.wmf) *of* serving cell ![](media/image66.wmf)*, or* if
*srs-PowerControlAdjustmentStates* indicates separate power control
adjustment states between SRS transmissions and PUSCH transmissions, and
if *tpc-Accumulation* is not provided, where

\- The ![](media/image285.wmf) values are given in Table 7.1.1-1

\- ![](media/image286.wmf) is jointly coded with other TPC commands in a
PDCCH with DCI format 2\_3, as described in clause 11.4

\- ![](media/image287.wmf) is a sum of TPC command values in a set
![](media/image288.wmf) of TPC command values with cardinality
![](media/image289.wmf) that the UE receives between
![](media/image290.wmf) symbols before SRS transmission occasion
![](media/image291.wmf) and ![](media/image292.wmf) symbols before SRS
transmission occasion ![](media/image151.wmf) on active UL BWP
![](media/image92.wmf) of carrier ![](media/image65.wmf) *of* serving
cell ![](media/image66.wmf) for SRS power control adjustment state,
where ![](media/image152.wmf) is the smallest integer for which
![](media/image293.wmf) symbols before SRS transmission occasion
![](media/image291.wmf) is earlier than ![](media/image294.wmf) symbols
before SRS transmission occasion ![](media/image151.wmf)

\- if the SRS transmission is aperiodic, ![](media/image295.wmf) is a
number of symbols for active UL BWP ![](media/image92.wmf) of carrier
![](media/image65.wmf) *of* serving cell ![](media/image66.wmf) after a
last symbol of a corresponding PDCCH triggering the SRS transmission and
before a first symbol of the SRS transmission

\- if the SRS transmission is semi-persistent or periodic,
![](media/image296.wmf) is a number of ![](media/image297.wmf) symbols
equal to the product of a number of symbols per slot,
![](media/image158.wmf), and the minimum of the values provided by *k2*
in *PUSCH-ConfigCommon* for active UL BWP ![](media/image92.wmf) of
carrier ![](media/image65.wmf) *of* serving cell ![](media/image66.wmf)

\- If the first symbol of the SRS transmission occasion occurs within
$T_{proc,2}$ after a last symbol of a CORESET where the UE detects the
DCI format providing the TPC command, the UE may postpone the
application of the TPC until the above condition is not valid.
$T_{proc,2}$ is the PUSCH preparation time for the corresponding UE
processing capability \[6, TS 38.214\] assuming $d_{2,1} = 0$*,* and
$\mu$ corresponds to the smallest SCS configuration between the SCS
configuration of the PDCCH carrying the DCI format and the SCS
configuration of the SRS.

\- If the UE has reached maximum power for active UL BWP
![](media/image92.wmf) of carrier ![](media/image65.wmf) *of* serving
cell ![](media/image66.wmf) at SRS transmission occasion
![](media/image149.wmf) and ![](media/image298.wmf), then

$h_{b,f,c}\left( 0 \right) = \ \Delta P_{\text{rampup},b,f,c} + \delta_{b,f,c}$

where

$\delta_{b,f,c}$ is

corresponding to a PRACH transmission according to Type-1 random access
procedure, or in a random access response grant corresponding to MsgA
transmissions according to Type-2 random access procedure with RAR

\- ![](media/image308.wmf) if the UE is not configured for PUSCH
transmissions on active UL BWP ![](media/image92.wmf) of carrier
![](media/image65.wmf) *of* serving cell ![](media/image66.wmf)*, or* if
*srs-PowerControlAdjustmentStates* indicates separate power control
adjustment states between SRS transmissions and PUSCH transmissions, and
*tpc-Accumulation* is provided, and the UE detects a DCI format 2\_3
![](media/image309.wmf) symbols before a first symbol of SRS
transmission occasion ![](media/image133.wmf), where absolute values of
![](media/image310.wmf) are provided in Table 7.1.1-1

\- if *srs-PowerControlAdjustmentStates* indicates a same power control
adjustment state for SRS transmissions and PUSCH transmissions, the
update of the power control adjustment state for SRS transmission
occasion ![](media/image133.wmf) occurs at the beginning of each SRS
resource in the SRS resource set ![](media/image278.wmf); otherwise, the
update of the power control adjustment state SRS transmission occasion
![](media/image133.wmf) occurs at the beginning of the first transmitted
SRS resource in the SRS resource set ![](media/image278.wmf).

If a UE transmits SRS based on a configuration by *SRS-PosResourceSet*
on active UL BWP $b$ of carrier $f$ *of* serving cell $c$, the UE
determines the SRS transmission power
$P_{SRS,b,f,c}\left( i,q_{s} \right)$ in SRS transmission occasion $i$
as

![](media/image311.wmf) \[dBm\]

where,

> \- $P_{O\_ SRS,b,f,c}\left( q_{s} \right)$ and

estimate in dB calculated by the UE, as described in clause 7.1.1 in
case of an active DL BWP *of* a serving cell $c$, using RS resource
indexed $q_{d}$ in a serving or non-serving cell for SRS resource set
$q_{s}$ \[6, TS 38.214\]. A configuration for RS resource index $q_{d}$
associated with SRS resource set $q_{s}$ is provided by
*pathlossReferenceRS-Pos*

\- if a *ssb-IndexServing* is provided*, referenceSignalPower* is
provided by *ss-PBCH-BlockPower*

\- if a *ssb-Ncell* is provided*, referenceSignalPower* is provided by
*ss-PBCH-BlockPower-r16*

\- if a *dl-PRS* is provided, *referenceSignalPower* is provided by
*dl-PRS-ResourcePower*

If the UE determines that the UE is not able to accurately measure
$\text{PL}_{b,f,c}\left( q_{d} \right)$, or the UE is not provided with
*pathlossReferenceRS-Pos, the UE calculates*
$\text{PL}_{b,f,c}\left( q_{d} \right)$ using *a RS resource obtained
from the SS/PBCH block of the serving cell that the UE uses to obtain
MIB*

The UE may indicate a capability for a number of pathloss estimates that
the UE can simultaneously maintain for all SRS resource sets provided by
*SRS-PosResourceSet* in addition to the up to four pathloss estimates
that the UE maintains per serving cell for PUSCH/PUCCH transmissions and
for SRS transmissions configured by *SRS-Resource*.

7.4 Physical random access channel
----------------------------------

A UE determines a transmission power for a physical random access
channel (PRACH), ![](media/image312.wmf), on active UL BWP
![](media/image92.wmf) of carrier ![](media/image65.wmf) of serving cell
![](media/image66.wmf) based on DL RS for serving cell
![](media/image66.wmf) in transmission occasion ![](media/image313.wmf)
as

![](media/image314.wmf) \[dBm\],

where ![](media/image315.wmf) is the UE configured maximum output power
defined in \[8-1, TS 38.101-1\], \[8-2, TS 38.101-2\] and \[8-3, TS
38.101-3\] for carrier ![](media/image65.wmf) of serving cell
![](media/image66.wmf) within transmission occasion
![](media/image73.wmf), ![](media/image316.wmf) is the PRACH target
reception power *PREAMBLE\_RECEIVED\_TARGET\_POWER* provided by higher
layers \[11, TS 38.321\] for the active UL BWP ![](media/image92.wmf) of
carrier ![](media/image65.wmf) of serving cell ![](media/image66.wmf),
and ![](media/image317.wmf) is a pathloss for the active UL BWP
![](media/image92.wmf) of carrier ![](media/image65.wmf) *based on* the
DL RS associated with the PRACH transmission on the active DL BWP *of*
serving cell ![](media/image66.wmf) and calculated by the UE in dB as
*referenceSignalPower* -- higher layer filtered RSRP in dBm, where RSRP
is defined in \[7, TS 38.215\] and the higher layer filter configuration
is defined in \[12, TS 38.331\]. If the active DL BWP is the initial DL
BWP and for SS/PBCH block and CORESET multiplexing pattern 2 or 3, as
described in clause 13, the UE determines ![](media/image318.wmf) based
on the SS/PBCH block associated with the PRACH transmission.

If a PRACH transmission from a UE is not in response to a detection of a
PDCCH order by the UE, or is in response to a detection of a PDCCH order
by the UE that triggers a contention based random access procedure, or
is associated with a link recovery procedure where a corresponding index
![](media/image56.wmf) *is associated with a SS/PBCH block, as described
in clause 6,* *referenceSignalPower* is provided by
*ss-PBCH-BlockPower*.

If a PRACH transmission from a UE is in response to a detection of a
PDCCH order by the UE that triggers a contention-free random access
procedure and depending on the DL RS that the DM-RS of the PDCCH order
is quasi-collocated with as described in clause 10.1,
*referenceSignalPower* is provided by *ss-PBCH-BlockPower* or, if the UE
is configured resources for a periodic CSI-RS reception or the PRACH
transmission is associated with a link recovery procedure where a
corresponding index ![](media/image56.wmf) *is associated with a
periodic CSI-RS configuration* *as described in clause 6*,
*referenceSignalPower* is obtained by *ss-PBCH-BlockPower* and
*powerControlOffsetSS* where *powerControlOffsetSS* provides an offset
of CSI-RS transmission power relative to SS/PBCH block transmission
power \[6, TS 38.214\]. If *powerControlOffsetSS* is not provided to the
UE, the UE assumes an offset of 0 dB. If the active TCI state for the
PDCCH that provides the PDCCH order includes two RS, the UE expects that
one RS is configured with *qcl-Type* set to \'typeD\' and the UE uses
the one RS when applying a value provided by *powerControlOffsetSS*.

If within a random access response window, as described in clause 8.2,
the UE does not receive a random access response that contains a
preamble identifier corresponding to the preamble sequence transmitted
by the UE, the UE determines a transmission power for a subsequent PRACH
transmission, if any, as described in \[11, TS 38.321\].

If prior to a PRACH retransmission, a UE changes the spatial domain
transmission filter, Layer 1 notifies higher layers to suspend the power
ramping counter as described in \[11, TS 38.321\].

If due to power allocation *to* PUSCH/PUCCH/PRACH*/SRS transmissions as
described in clause 7.5, or due to power allocation in EN-DC or NE-DC or
NR-DC operation, or due to slot format determination as described in
clause 11.1, or due to the* PUSCH/PUCCH/PRACH*/SRS transmission
occasions are in the same slot or the gap between a PRACH transmission
and PUSCH/PUCCH/SRS transmission is small as described in clause 8.1, or
due to DAPS operation as described in clause 15,* the UE does not
transmit a PRACH *in a transmission occasion*, Layer 1 notifies higher
layers to suspend the corresponding power ramping counter. If due to
power allocation *to* PUSCH/PUCCH/PRACH*/SRS transmissions as described
in clause 7.5, or due to power allocation in EN-DC or NE-DC or NR-DC
operation,* the UE transmits a PRACH with reduced power *in a
transmission occasion*, Layer 1 may notify higher layers to suspend the
corresponding power ramping counter.

7.5 Prioritizations for transmission power reductions
-----------------------------------------------------

For single cell operation with two uplink carriers or for operation with
carrier aggregation, if a *total UE transmit power for PUSCH or PUCCH or
PRACH or SRS transmissions on serving cells in a frequency range in a
respective transmission occasion* ![](media/image319.wmf) *would exceed*
![](media/image320.wmf)*, where* ![](media/image320.wmf) *is the linear
value of* ![](media/image321.wmf) *in transmission occasion*
![](media/image319.wmf) *as defined in \[8-1, TS 38.101-1\] for FR1* and
\[8-2, TS 38.101-2\] *for FR2, the UE allocates power to*
PUSCH/PUCCH/PRACH*/SRS transmissions according to the following priority
order (in descending order) so that the total UE transmit power for
transmissions on serving cells in the frequency range is smaller than or
equal to* ![](media/image320.wmf) *for that frequency range in every
symbol of transmission occasion* ![](media/image319.wmf)*. When
determining a total transmit power for serving cells in a frequency
range in a symbol of transmission occasion* ![](media/image319.wmf)*,
the UE does not include power for transmissions starting after the
symbol of transmission occasion* ![](media/image319.wmf)*. The total UE
transmit power in a symbol of a slot is defined as the sum of the linear
values of UE transmit powers for PUSCH, PUCCH, PRACH, and SRS in the
symbol of the slot.*

\- PRACH transmission on the PCell

\- PUCCH or PUSCH transmissions with higher priority index according to
clause 9

\- For PUCCH or PUSCH transmissions with same priority index

\- PUCCH transmission with HARQ-ACK information, and/or SR, and/or LRR,
or PUSCH transmission with HARQ-ACK information

\- PUCCH transmission with CSI or PUSCH transmission with CSI

\- PUSCH transmission without HARQ-ACK information or CSI and, for
Type-2 random access procedure, PUSCH transmission on the PCell

\- SRS transmission, with aperiodic SRS having higher priority than
semi-persistent and/or periodic SRS, or PRACH transmission on a serving
cell other than the PCell

In case of same priority order and for operation with carrier
aggregation, the UE prioritizes power allocation for transmissions on
the primary cell of the MCG or the SCG over transmissions on a secondary
cell. In case of same priority order and for operation with two UL
carriers, the UE prioritizes power allocation for transmissions on the
carrier where the UE is configured to transmit PUCCH. If *PUCCH* is not
configured for any of the *two UL carriers, the UE prioritizes power
allocation for transmissions on* the non-supplementary UL carrier.

7.6 Dual connectivity
---------------------

### 7.6.1 EN-DC

If a UE is configured with a MCG using E-UTRA radio access and with a
SCG using NR radio access, the UE is configured a maximum power
![](media/image322.wmf) for transmissions on the MCG by *p-MaxEUTRA* and
a maximum power ![](media/image323.wmf) for transmissions in FR1 on the
SCG by *p-NR-FR1*.

The UE determines a transmission power for the MCG as described in \[13,
TS 36.213\] using ![](media/image324.wmf) as the maximum transmission
power. The UE determines transmission power for the SCG in FR1 as
described in clauses 7.1 through 7.5 using ![](media/image325.wmf) as
the maximum transmission power. The UE determines transmission power for
the SCG in FR2 as described in clauses 7.1 through 7.5.

A UE does not expect to be configured for operation with shortened TTI
and/or processing time \[13, TS 36.213\] on a cell that is included in
an EN-DC configuration.

If a UE is configured with ![](media/image326.wmf), where
![](media/image327.wmf) is the linear value of ![](media/image322.wmf),
![](media/image328.wmf) is the linear value of ![](media/image323.wmf),
and ![](media/image329.wmf) is the linear value of a configured maximum
transmission power for EN-DC operation as *defined in* \[8-3, TS
38.101-3\] for FR1, the UE determines a transmission power for the SCG
as follows.

\- If the UE is configured with reference TDD configuration for E-UTRA
(by *tdm-PatternConfig* or by *tdm-PatternConfig2* in \[13, TS 36.213\])

\- If the UE does not indicate a capability for dynamic power sharing
between E-UTRA and NR for EN-DC, the UE does not transmit in a slot on
the SCG in FR1 when a corresponding subframe on the MCG is an UL
subframe in the reference TDD configuration.

\- If the UE indicates a capability for dynamic power sharing between
E-UTRA and NR for EN-DC, and does not indicate a capability
*tdm-restrictionDualTX-FDD-endc-r16* in \[16, TS 38.306\], and is
configured with *tdm-PatternConfig2*, the UE does not transmit on the
SCG in FR1 when the UE has overlapped transmission on a subframe on the
MCG.

\- If the UE indicates a capability for dynamic power sharing between
E-UTRA and NR for EN-DC and

\- if UE transmission(s) in subframe ![](media/image330.wmf) of the MCG
overlap in time with UE transmission(s) in slot ![](media/image331.wmf)
of the SCG in FR1, and

\- if ![](media/image332.wmf) in any portion of slot
![](media/image331.wmf) of the SCG,

the UE reduces transmission power in any portion of slot
![](media/image331.wmf) of the SCG so that ![](media/image333.wmf) in
any portion of slot ![](media/image331.wmf), where
![](media/image334.wmf) and ![](media/image335.wmf) are the linear
values of the total UE transmission powers in subframe
![](media/image336.wmf) of the MCG and in slot ![](media/image331.wmf)
of the SCG in FR1, respectively. The UE is not required to transmit in
any portion of slot ![](media/image331.wmf) of the SCG if
![](media/image335.wmf) would need to be reduced by more than the value
provided by *X~SCALE~* in order for ![](media/image333.wmf) in any
portion of slot ![](media/image331.wmf) of the SCG. The UE is required
to transmit in slot ![](media/image331.wmf) of the SCG if
![](media/image335.wmf) would not need to be reduced by more than the
value provided by *X~SCALE~* in order for ![](media/image333.wmf) in all
portions of slot ![](media/image331.wmf).

\- If the UE does not indicate a capability for dynamic power sharing
between E-UTRA and NR for EN-DC, the UE expects to be configured with
reference TDD configuration for E-UTRA by *tdm-PatternConfig* in \[13,
TS 36.213\].

### 7.6.1A NE-DC

If a UE is configured with an MCG using NR radio access and with a SCG
using E-UTRA radio access, the UE is configured a maximum power
![](media/image323.wmf) for transmissions in FR1 on the MCG by
*p-NR-FR1* and a maximum power ![](media/image322.wmf) for transmissions
on the SCG by *p-MaxEUTRA*.

The UE determines transmission power for the MCG in FR1 as described in
clauses 7.1 through 7.5 using ![](media/image323.wmf) as the maximum
transmission power for ![](media/image337.wmf). The UE determines
transmission power for the MCG in FR2 as described in clauses 7.1
through 7.5.

If the UE is not provided *tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon for the MCG,
t*he UE determines a transmission power for the SCG as described in
\[13, TS 36.213\] using ![](media/image324.wmf) as the maximum
transmission power.

If at least one symbol of slot ![](media/image330.wmf) of the MCG that
is indicated as uplink or flexible by *tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon* or
*tdd*-*UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated* overlaps with subframe
![](media/image331.wmf) of the SCG

\- for subframe ![](media/image331.wmf), the UE determines a
transmission power for the SCG as described in \[13, TS 36.213\] using
![](media/image324.wmf) as the maximum transmission power

otherwise

\- the UE determines a transmission power for the SCG as described in
\[13, TS 36.213\] without considering ![](media/image324.wmf) as the
maximum transmission power

If a UE is configured with ![](media/image338.wmf), where
![](media/image327.wmf) is the linear value of ![](media/image322.wmf),
![](media/image328.wmf) is the linear value of ![](media/image323.wmf),
and ![](media/image339.wmf) is the linear value of a configured maximum
transmission power for NE-DC operation as *defined in* \[8-3, TS
38.101-3\] for FR1, the UE determines a transmission power for the MCG
as follows

\- If the UE is configured with reference TDD configuration for E-UTRA
(by *tdm-PatternConfigNE-DC-r15* in \[13, TS 36.213\])

\- If the UE does not indicate a capability for dynamic power sharing
between E-UTRA and NR for NE-DC, the UE does not expect to transmit in a
slot on the MCG in FR1 when a corresponding subframe on the SCG is an UL
subframe in the reference TDD configuration.

\- If the UE indicates a capability for dynamic power sharing between
E-UTRA and NR for NE-DC and

\- if the UE transmission(s) in slot ![](media/image330.wmf) of the MCG
in FR1 overlap in time with UE transmission(s) in subframe
![](media/image331.wmf) of the SCG, and

\- if ![](media/image340.wmf) in any portion of slot
![](media/image330.wmf) of the MCG,

the UE reduces transmission power in any portion of slot
![](media/image330.wmf) of the MCG so that ![](media/image341.wmf) in
all portions of slot ![](media/image330.wmf), where
![](media/image334.wmf) and ![](media/image335.wmf) are the linear
values of the total UE transmission powers in slot
![](media/image330.wmf) of the MCG in FR1 and in subframe
![](media/image331.wmf) of the SCG, respectively.

\- If the UE does not indicate a capability for dynamic power sharing
between E-UTRA and NR for NE-DC, the UE expects to be configured with
reference TDD configuration for E-UTRA (by *tdm-PatternConfigNE-DC-r15*
in \[13, TS 36.213\]).

### 7.6.2 NR-DC

If a UE is configured with an MCG using NR radio access in FR1 or in FR2
and with a SCG using NR radio access in FR2 or in FR1, respectively, the
UE performs transmission power control independently per cell group as
described in clauses 7.1 through 7.5.

If a UE is configured with an MCG and a SCG using NR radio access in FR1
and/or in FR2, the UE is configured a maximum power $P_{\text{MCG}}$ for
transmissions on the MCG by *p-NR-FR1* and/or by *p-NR-FR2* and a
maximum power $P_{\text{SCG}}$ for transmissions on the SCG by
*p-NR-FR1* and/or by *p-NR-FR2* and with an inter-CG power sharing mode
by *nrdc-PCmode-FR1 for FR1 and/or* by *nrdc-PCmode-FR2 for FR2*. The UE
determines a transmission power on the MCG and a transmission power on
the SCG per frequency range.

If a UE is provided *semi-static-mode1 for nrdc-PCmode-FR1* or for
*nrdc-PCmode-FR2, or semi-static-mode2 for nrdc-PCmode-FR1* or for
*nrdc-PCmode-FR2, the UE does not expect* $P_{\text{MCG}}$ and
$P_{\text{SCG}}$ *to be configured such that*
${\widehat{P}}_{\text{MCG}} + {\widehat{P}}_{\text{SCG}} > {\widehat{P}}_{\text{Total}}^{NR - DC}$,
where ${\widehat{P}}_{\text{MCG}}$ is the linear value of
$P_{\text{MCG}}$, ${\widehat{P}}_{\text{SCG}}$ is the linear value of
$P_{\text{SCG}}$, and ${\widehat{P}}_{\text{Total}}^{NR - DC}$ is the
linear value of a configured maximum transmission power for NR-DC
operation in FR1 or FR2 as defined in \[8-3, TS 38.101-3\].

If a UE is provided *semi-static-mode1 for nrdc-PCmode-FR1* or for
*nrdc-PCmode-FR2*, the UE determines a transmission power for the MCG or
for the SCG as described in clauses 7.1 through 7.5 using
$P_{\text{MCG}}$ or $P_{\text{SCG}}$ as the maximum transmission power,
respectively.

If a UE is provided *semi-static-mode2 for nrdc-PCmode-FR1* or for
*nrdc-PCmode-FR2*

\- if the UE is not provided *tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon* for the MCG
or SCG, the UE determines a transmission power for the MCG or for the
SCG as described in clauses 7.1 through 7.5 using $P_{\text{MCG}}$ or
$P_{\text{SCG}}$ as the maximum transmission power, respectively

\- if at least one symbol of slot $i_{1}$ of the MCG or of the SCG that
is indicated as uplink or flexible to a UE by
*tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon* and
*tdd*-*UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated*, if provided, overlaps with a
symbol for any ongoing transmission overlapping with slot $i_{2}$ of the
SCG or of the MCG, respectively, the UE determines a power for the
transmission on the SCG or the MCG overlapping with slot $i_{2}$ as
described in clauses 7.1 through 7.5 using $P_{\text{SCG}}$ or
$P_{\text{MCG}}$, respectively, as the maximum transmission power

\- otherwise, the UE determines a power for the transmission on SCG or
the MCG overlapping with slot $i_{2}$, as described in \[8-3, TS
38.101-3\] and in clauses 7.1 through 7.5 without considering
$P_{\text{SCG}}$ or $P_{\text{MCG}}$ respectively

The UE expects to be provided *semi-static-mode2* for *nrdc-PCmode-FR1*
or for *nrdc-PCmode-FR2* only for synchronous NR-DC operation \[10, TS
38.133\].

If a UE

\- is provided *dynamic* for *nrdc-PCmode-FR1* or for *nrdc-PCmode-FR2*,
and

\- indicates a capability to support dynamic power sharing for intra-FR
NR DC,

the UE determines a maximum transmission power on the SCG at a first
symbol of a transmission occasion on the SCG by determining
transmissions on the MCG that

\- are scheduled by DCI formats in PDCCH receptions with a last symbol
that is earlier by at least $T_{\text{offset}}$ from the first symbol of
the transmission occasion on the SCG, or are configured by higher
layers, and

\- overlap with the transmission occasion on the SCG

the maximum transmission power on the SCG is determined as

\-
$\min\left( {\widehat{P}}_{\text{SCG}},{\widehat{P}}_{\text{Total}}^{\text{NR-DC}} - \ {\widehat{P}}_{\text{MCG}}^{\text{actual}} \right)$,
if the UE determines transmissions on the MCG with a
${\widehat{P}}_{\text{MCG}}^{\text{actual}}$ total power

\- ${\widehat{P}}_{\text{Total}}^{\text{NR-DC}}$, if the UE does not
determine any transmissions on the MCG

where

> \-
> $T_{\text{offset}} = max\{ T_{proc,MCG}^{\max},T_{proc,SCG}^{\max}\}$,

\- $T_{proc,MCG}^{\max}$ and $T_{proc,SCG}^{\max}$ is the maximum of
$T_{proc,2}$**,** $T_{proc,CSI}$**,**
$T_{proc,release}^{\text{mux}}$**,** $T_{proc,2}^{\text{mux}}$**,** and
$T_{proc,CSI}^{\text{mux}}$ based on the configurations on the MCG and
the SCG, respectively, when the UE indicates the value of \'long\' for
the capability,

\- $T_{proc,MCG}^{\max}$ and $T_{proc,SCG}^{\max}$ is the maximum of
$T_{proc,2}$**,** $T_{proc,release}^{\text{mux}}$**,**
$T_{proc,2}^{\text{mux}}$ based on the configurations on the MCG and the
SCG, respectively, when the UE indicates the value of \'short\' for the
capability, and

\- ${\widehat{P}}_{\text{MCG}}^{\text{actual}}$ is the total power for
the transmissions on the MCG that overlap with the transmission occasion
on the SCG where ${\widehat{P}}_{\text{MCG}}^{\text{actual}}$ is
determined based on transmissions configured by higher layers and on
transmissions scheduled by DCI formats in PDCCH receptions with a last
symbol that is at least $T_{\text{offset}}$ before the first symbol of
the transmission occasion on the SCG.

The UE does not expect to have PUSCH, PUCCH, PRACH, or SRS transmissions
on the MCG that

\- are scheduled/triggered by DCI formats in PDCCH receptions with a
last symbol that is earlier by less than $T_{\text{offset}}$ from the
first symbol of the transmission occasion on the SCG, and

> \- overlap with the transmission occasion on the SCG

The UE does not expect to receive a positive TPC command value in a DCI
format 2\_2 or a DCI format 2\_3 in a PDCCH reception with a last symbol
that is less than $T_{\text{offset}}$ before the first symbol of the
transmission occasion on the SCG, if the transmission on the MCG
overlaps with the transmission occasion on the SCG.

The UE is not required to apply a TPC command the UE receives in a DCI
format 2\_2 or a DCI format 2\_3 in a PDCCH reception with a last symbol
that is less than $T_{\text{offset}}$ before the first symbol of the
transmission occasion on the SCG, if the transmission on the MCG
overlaps with the transmission occasion on the SCG.

7.7 Power headroom report
-------------------------

The types of UE power headroom reports are the following. A Type 1 UE
power headroom ![](media/image342.wmf) that is valid for PUSCH
transmission occasion ![](media/image343.wmf) on active UL BWP
![](media/image92.wmf) of carrier ![](media/image65.wmf) *of* serving
cell ![](media/image66.wmf). A Type 3 UE power
headroom![](media/image342.wmf) that is valid for SRS transmission
occasion ![](media/image343.wmf) on active UL BWP ![](media/image92.wmf)
of carrier ![](media/image65.wmf) *of* serving cell
![](media/image66.wmf).

A UE determines whether a power headroom report for an activated serving
cell \[11, TS 38.321\] is based on an actual transmission or a reference
format based on the higher layer signalling of configured grant and
periodic/semi-persistent sounding reference signal transmissions and
downlink control information the UE received until and including the
PDCCH monitoring occasion where the UE detects the first DCI format
scheduling an initial transmission of a transport block since a power
headroom report was triggered if the power headroom report is reported
on a PUSCH triggered by the first DCI format. Otherwise, a UE determines
whether a power headroom report is based on an actual transmission or a
reference format based on the higher layer signalling of configured
grant and periodic/semi-persistent sounding reference signal
transmissions and downlink control information the UE received until the
first uplink symbol of a configured PUSCH transmission minus
*T\'~proc,2~*=*T~proc,2~* where *T~proc,2\ ~*is determined according to
\[6, TS 38.214\] assuming *d~2,1\ ~*= 1, *d~2,2~*=0, and with *µ~DL~*
corresponding to the subcarrier spacing of the active downlink BWP of
the scheduling cell for a configured grant if the power headroom report
is reported on the PUSCH using the configured grant.

If a UE

\- is configured with two UL carriers for a serving cell, and

\- determines a Type 1 power headroom report and a Type 3 power headroom
report for the serving cell

the UE

\- provides the Type 1 power headroom report if both the Type 1 and Type
3 power headroom reports are based on respective actual transmissions or
on respective reference transmissions

\- provides the power headroom report that is based on a respective
actual transmission if either the Type 1 report or the Type 3 report is
based on a respective reference transmission

If a UE is configured with a SCG and if *phr-ModeOtherCG* for a CG
indicates \'virtual\' then, for power headroom reports transmitted on
the CG, the UE computes *PH* assuming that the UE does not transmit
PUSCH/PUCCH on any serving cell of the other CG. For NR-DC when both the
MCG and the SCG operate either in FR1 or in FR2 and for a power headroom
report transmitted on the MCG or the SCG, the UE computes *PH* assuming
that the UE does not transmit PUSCH/PUCCH on any serving cell of the SCG
or the MCG, respectively.

If the UE is configured with a SCG,

\- For computing power headroom for cells belonging to MCG, the term
\'serving cell\' in this clause refers to serving cell belonging to the
MCG.

\- For computing power headroom for cells belonging to SCG, the term
\'serving cell\' in this clause refers to serving cell belonging to the
SCG. The term \'primary cell\' in this clause refers to the PSCell of
the SCG.

If the UE is configured with a PUCCH-SCell,

\- For computing power headroom for cells belonging to primary PUCCH
group, the term \'serving cell\' in this clause refers to serving cell
belonging to the primary PUCCH group.

\- For computing power headroom for cells belonging to secondary PUCCH
group, the term \'serving cell\' in this clause refers to serving cell
belonging to the secondary PUCCH group. The term \'primary cell\' in
this clause refers to the PUCCH-SCell of the secondary PUCCH group.

For a UE configured with EN-DC/NE-DC and capable of dynamic power
sharing, if E-UTRA Dual Connectivity PHR \[14, TS 36.321\] is triggered
and,

\- if the duration of NR slot on active UL BWP is different from that of
E-UTRA subframe carrying the Dual Connectivity PHR, the UE provides
power headroom of the first NR slot that fully overlaps with the E-UTRA
subframe;

\- if the duration of NR slot on active UL BWP is the same as that of
E-UTRA subframe carrying the Dual Connectivity PHR for asynchronous
EN-DC/NE-DC \[10, TS 38.133\], the UE provides power headroom of the
first NR slot that overlaps with the E-UTRA subframe.

### 7.7.1 Type 1 PH report

If a UE determines that a Type 1 power headroom report for an activated
serving cell is based on an actual PUSCH transmission then, for PUSCH
transmission occasion ![](media/image344.wmf) on active UL BWP
![](media/image92.wmf) *of* carrier ![](media/image65.wmf) *of* serving
cell ![](media/image66.wmf), the UE computes the Type 1 power headroom
report as

![](media/image345.wmf) \[dB\]

where ![](media/image346.wmf), ![](media/image347.wmf),
![](media/image348.wmf), ![](media/image349.wmf),
![](media/image350.wmf), ![](media/image351.wmf) and
![](media/image352.wmf) are defined in clause 7.1.1.

If a UE is configured with multiple cells for PUSCH transmissions, where
a SCS configuration ![](media/image353.wmf) on active UL BWP
![](media/image354.wmf) *of* carrier ![](media/image355.wmf) of serving
cell ![](media/image356.wmf) *is smaller than a* SCS configuration
![](media/image357.wmf) on active UL BWP ![](media/image358.wmf) *of*
carrier ![](media/image359.wmf) of serving cell
![](media/image360.wmf)*, and if the UE provides a Type 1 power headroom
report in a PUSCH transmission in a slot on active* UL BWP
![](media/image354.wmf) *that overlaps with multiple slots on active* UL
BWP ![](media/image358.wmf)*, the UE provides a Type 1 power headroom
report for the first PUSCH, if any, on the first slot of the multiple
slots on active* UL BWP ![](media/image358.wmf) that fully overlaps with
the slot on active UL BWP ![](media/image354.wmf). If a UE is configured
with multiple cells for PUSCH transmissions, where a same SCS
configuration on active UL BWP ![](media/image354.wmf) *of* carrier
![](media/image355.wmf) of serving cell ![](media/image356.wmf) *and*
active UL BWP ![](media/image358.wmf) *of* carrier
![](media/image359.wmf) of serving cell ![](media/image360.wmf)*, and if
the UE provides a Type 1 power headroom report in a PUSCH transmission
in a slot on active* UL BWP ![](media/image354.wmf) *, the UE provides a
Type 1 power headroom report for the first PUSCH, if any, on the slot on
active* UL BWP ![](media/image358.wmf) that overlaps with the slot on
active UL BWP ![](media/image354.wmf).

If a UE is configured with multiple cells for PUSCH transmissions *and
provides a Type 1 power headroom report in a PUSCH transmission with
PUSCH repetition Type B having a nominal repetition that spans multiple
slots on active* UL BWP
![](media/image361.wmf){width="0.19791666666666666in"
height="0.19791666666666666in"} *and overlaps with one or more slots on
active* UL BWP ![](media/image362.wmf){width="0.19791666666666666in"
height="0.19791666666666666in"}*, the UE provides a Type 1 power
headroom report for the first PUSCH, if any, on the first slot of the
one or more slots on active* UL BWP
![](media/image362.wmf){width="0.19791666666666666in"
height="0.19791666666666666in"} that overlaps with the multiple slots of
the nominal repetition on active UL BWP
![](media/image361.wmf){width="0.19791666666666666in"
height="0.19791666666666666in"}.

For a UE configured with EN-DC/NE-DC and capable of dynamic power
sharing, if E-UTRA Dual Connectivity PHR \[14, TS 36.321\] is triggered,
the UE provides power headroom of the first PUSCH, if any, on the
determined NR slot as described in clause 7.7.

If a UE is configured with multiple cells for PUSCH transmissions, the
UE does not consider for computation of a Type 1 power headroom report
in a first PUSCH transmission that includes an initial transmission of
transport block on active UL BWP ![](media/image354.wmf) *of* carrier
![](media/image355.wmf) of serving cell ![](media/image356.wmf)*, a
second* PUSCH transmission on active UL BWP ![](media/image358.wmf) *of*
carrier ![](media/image359.wmf) of serving cell ![](media/image363.wmf)
*that overlaps with the first PUSCH transmission if*

\- the second PUSCH transmission is scheduled by a DCI format in a PDCCH
received in a second PDCCH monitoring occasion, and

\- the second PDCCH monitoring occasion is after a first PDCCH
monitoring occasion where the UE detects the earliest DCI format
scheduling an initial transmission of a transport block after a power
headroom report was triggered

or

\- the second PUSCH transmission is after the first uplink symbol of the
first PUSCH transmission minus *T\'~proc,2~*=*T~proc,2~* where
*T~proc,2~* is determined according to \[6, TS 38.214\] assuming
*d~2,1\ ~*=1, *d~2,2~*=0, and with *µ~DL~* corresponding to the
subcarrier spacing of the active downlink BWP of the scheduling cell for
a configured grant if the first PUSCH transmission is on a configured
grant after a power headroom report was triggered.

If the UE determines that a Type 1 power headroom report for an
activated serving cell is based on a reference PUSCH transmission then,
for PUSCH transmission occasion ![](media/image344.wmf) on active UL BWP
![](media/image92.wmf) *of* carrier ![](media/image364.wmf) of serving
cell ![](media/image365.wmf), the UE computes the Type 1 power headroom
report as

![](media/image366.wmf) \[dB\]

where ![](media/image367.wmf) is computed assuming MPR=0 dB, A-MPR=0 dB,
P-MPR=0 dB. ∆T~C~ = 0 dB. MPR, A-MPR, P-MPR and ∆T~C~ are defined in
\[8-1, TS 38.101-1\], \[8-2, TS 38.101-2\] and \[8-3, TS 38.101-3\]. The
remaining parameters are defined in clause 7.1.1 where
![](media/image368.wmf) and ![](media/image369.wmf) are obtained using
![](media/image370.wmf) and *p0-PUSCH-AlphaSetId* *=* 0*,*
![](media/image371.wmf) is obtained using *pusch-PathlossReferenceRS-Id
=* 0, and ![](media/image372.wmf).

If a UE is configured with two UL carriers for a serving cell and the UE
determines a Type 1 power headroom report for the serving cell based on
a reference PUSCH transmission, the UE computes a Type 1 power headroom
report for the serving cell assuming a reference PUSCH transmission on
the UL carrier provided by *pusch-Config*. If the UE is provided
*pusch-Config* for both UL carriers, the UE computes a Type 1 power
headroom report for the serving cell assuming a reference PUSCH
transmission on the UL carrier provided by *pucch-Config*. If
*pucch-Config* is not provided to the UE for any of the two UL carriers,
the UE computes a Type 1 power headroom report for the serving cell
assuming a reference PUSCH transmission on the non-supplementary UL
carrier.

### 7.7.2 Type 2 PH report

This clause is reserved.

### 7.7.3 Type 3 PH report

If a UE determines that a Type 3 power headroom report for an activated
serving cell is based on an actual SRS transmission then, for SRS
transmission occasion ![](media/image344.wmf) on active UL BWP
![](media/image92.wmf) *of* carrier ![](media/image364.wmf) *of* serving
cell $c$ and if the UE is not configured for PUSCH transmissions on
carrier ![](media/image364.wmf) *of* serving cell $c$ and the resource
for the SRS transmission is provided by *SRS-Resource*, the UE computes
a Type 3 power headroom report as

![](media/image373.wmf) \[dB\]

where ![](media/image374.wmf), ![](media/image375.wmf),
![](media/image376.wmf), ![](media/image377.wmf),
![](media/image371.wmf) and ![](media/image378.wmf) are defined in
clause 7.3.1 with corresponding values provided by *SRS-ResourceSet*.

If the UE determines that a Type 3 power headroom report for an
activated serving cell is based on a reference SRS transmission then,
for SRS transmission occasion ![](media/image379.wmf) on UL BWP
![](media/image92.wmf) *of* carrier ![](media/image364.wmf) *of* serving
cell $c$, and if the UE is not configured for PUSCH transmissions on UL
BWP ![](media/image92.wmf) *of* carrier ![](media/image364.wmf) *of*
serving cell $c$ and a resource for the reference SRS transmission is
provided by *SRS-Resource*, the UE computes a Type 3 power headroom
report as

![](media/image380.wmf) \[dB\]

where ![](media/image381.wmf) is an SRS resource set corresponding to
*SRS-ResourceSetId = 0* for UL BWP ![](media/image92.wmf) and
![](media/image382.wmf), ![](media/image383.wmf),
![](media/image384.wmf) and ![](media/image385.wmf) are defined in
clause 7.3.1 with corresponding values obtained from *SRS-ResourceSetId
= 0* for UL BWP ![](media/image92.wmf). ![](media/image386.wmf) is
computed assuming MPR=0 dB, A-MPR=0 dB, P-MPR=0 dB and ∆T~C~ =0 dB. MPR,
A-MPR, P-MPR and ∆T~C~ are defined in \[8-1, TS 38.101-1\], \[8-2, TS
38.101-2\] and \[8-3, TS 38.101-3\].

If a UE is configured with two UL carriers for a serving cell and the UE
determines a Type 3 power headroom report for the serving cell based on
a reference SRS transmission and a resource for the reference SRS is
provided by *SRS-Resource*, the UE computes a Type 3 power headroom
report for the serving cell assuming a reference SRS transmission on the
UL carrier provided by *pucch-Config*. If *pucch-Config* is not provided
to the UE for any of the two UL carriers, the UE computes a Type 3 power
headroom report for the serving cell assuming a reference SRS
transmission on the non-supplementary UL carrier.

8 Random access procedure
=========================

Prior to initiation of the physical random access procedure, Layer 1
receives from higher layers a set of SS/PBCH block indexes and provides
to higher layers a corresponding set of RSRP measurements.

Prior to initiation of the physical random access procedure, Layer 1 may
receive from higher layers an indication to perform a Type-1 random
access procedure, as described in clauses 8.1 through 8.4, or a Type-2
random access procedure as described in clauses 8.1 through 8.2A.

Prior to initiation of the physical random access procedure, Layer 1
receives the following information from the higher layers:

\- Configuration of physical random access channel (PRACH) transmission
parameters (PRACH preamble format, time resources, and frequency
resources for PRACH transmission).

\- Parameters for determining the root sequences and their cyclic shifts
in the PRACH preamble sequence set (index to logical root sequence
table, cyclic shift (![](media/image387.wmf)), and set type
(unrestricted, restricted set A, or restricted set B)).

From the physical layer perspective, the Type-1 L1 random access
procedure includes the transmission of random access preamble (Msg1) in
a PRACH, random access response (RAR) message with a PDCCH/PDSCH (Msg2),
and when applicable, the transmission of a PUSCH scheduled by a RAR UL
grant, and PDSCH for contention resolution.

From the physical layer perspective, the Type-2 L1 random access
procedure includes the transmission of random access preamble in a PRACH
and of a PUSCH (MsgA) and the reception of a RAR message with a
PDCCH/PDSCH (MsgB), and when applicable, the transmission of a PUSCH
scheduled by a fallback RAR UL grant, and PDSCH for contention
resolution.

If a random access procedure is initiated by a PDCCH order to the UE, a
PRACH transmission is with a same SCS as a PRACH transmission initiated
by higher layers.

If a UE is configured with two UL carriers for a serving cell and the UE
detects a PDCCH order, the UE uses the UL/SUL indicator field value from
the detected PDCCH order to determine the UL carrier for the
corresponding PRACH transmission.

8.1 Random access preamble
--------------------------

Physical random access procedure is triggered upon request of a PRACH
transmission by higher layers or by a PDCCH order. A configuration by
higher layers for a PRACH transmission includes the following:

\- A configuration for PRACH transmission \[4, TS 38.211\].

\- A preamble index, a preamble SCS, ![](media/image388.wmf), a
corresponding RA-RNTI, and a PRACH resource.

A PRACH is transmitted using the selected PRACH format with transmission
power ![](media/image312.wmf), as described in clause 7.4, on the
indicated PRACH resource.

For Type-1 random access procedure, a UE is provided a number $N$ of
SS/PBCH block indexes associated with one PRACH occasion and a number
$R$ of contention based preambles per SS/PBCH block index per valid
PRACH occasion by *ssb-perRACH-OccasionAndCB-PreamblesPerSSB*.

For Type-2 random access procedure with common configuration of PRACH
occasions with Type-1 random access procedure, a UE is provided a number
$N$ of SS/PBCH block indexes associated with one PRACH occasion by
*ssb-perRACH-OccasionAndCB-PreamblesPerSSB* and a number $Q$ of
contention based preambles per SS/PBCH block index per valid PRACH
occasion by *msgA-CB-PreamblesPerSSB-PerSharedRO*. The PRACH
transmission can be on a subset of PRACH occasions associated with a
same SS/PBCH block index within an SSB-RO mapping cycle for a UE
provided with a PRACH mask index by *msgA-SSB-SharedRO-MaskIndex*
according to \[11, TS 38.321\].

For Type-2 random access procedure with separate configuration of PRACH
occasions with Type-1 random access procedure, a UE is provided a number
$N$ of SS/PBCH block indexes associated with one PRACH occasion and a
number $R$ of contention based preambles per SS/PBCH block index per
valid PRACH occasion by *msgA-SSB-PerRACH-OccasionAndCB-PreamblesPerSSB
when provided; otherwise, by ssb-perRACH-OccasionAndCB-PreamblesPerSSB*.

For Type-1 random access procedure, or for Type-2 random access
procedure with separate configuration of PRACH occasions from Type 1
random access procedure, if $N < 1$, one SS/PBCH block index is mapped
to $\frac{1}{N}$ consecutive valid PRACH occasions and $R$ contention
based preambles with consecutive indexes associated with the SS/PBCH
block index per valid PRACH occasion start from preamble index 0. If
$N \geq 1$, $R$ contention based preambles with consecutive indexes
associated with SS/PBCH block index $n$, $0 \leq n \leq N - 1$, per
valid PRACH occasion start from preamble index
$n\frac{{\cdot N}_{\text{preamble}}^{\text{total}}}{N}$ where
$N_{\text{preamble}}^{\text{total}}$ is provided by
*totalNumberOfRA-Preambles* for Type-1 random access procedure, or by
*msgA-TotalNumberOfRA-Preambles* for Type-2 random access procedure with
separate configuration of PRACH occasions from a Type 1 random access
procedure, and is an integer multiple of $N$.

For Type-2 random access procedure with common configuration of PRACH
occasions with Type-1 random access procedure, if $N < 1$, one SS/PBCH
block index is mapped to $\frac{1}{N}$ consecutive valid PRACH occasions
and $Q$ contention based preambles with consecutive indexes associated
with the SS/PBCH block index per valid PRACH occasion start from
preamble index $R$. If $N \geq 1$, $Q$ contention based preambles with
consecutive indexes associated with SS/PBCH block index $n$,
$0 \leq n \leq N - 1$, per valid PRACH occasion start from preamble
index $n\frac{{\cdot N}_{\text{preamble}}^{\text{total}}}{N} + R$, where
$N_{\text{preamble}}^{\text{total}}$ is provided by
*totalNumberOfRA-Preambles* for Type-1 random access procedure.

For link recovery, a UE is provided $N$ SS/PBCH block indexes associated
with one PRACH occasion by *ssb-perRACH-Occasion* in
*BeamFailureRecoveryConfig*. For a dedicated RACH configuration provided
by *RACH-ConfigDedicated*, if *cfra* is provided, a UE is provided $N$
SS/PBCH block indexes associated with one PRACH occasion by
*ssb-perRACH-Occasion* in *occasions*. If $N < 1$, one SS/PBCH block
index is mapped to $\frac{1}{N}$ consecutive valid PRACH occasions. If
$N \geq 1$, all consecutive $N$ SS/PBCH block indexes are associated
with one PRACH occasion.

SS/PBCH block indexes provided by *ssb-PositionsInBurst* in *SIB1* or in
*ServingCellConfigCommon* are mapped to valid PRACH occasions in the
following order where the parameters are described in \[4, TS 38.211\].

\- First, in increasing order of preamble indexes within a single PRACH
occasion

\- Second, in increasing order of frequency resource indexes for
frequency multiplexed PRACH occasions

\- Third, in increasing order of time resource indexes for time
multiplexed PRACH occasions within a PRACH slot

\- Fourth, in increasing order of indexes for PRACH slots

An association period, starting from frame 0, for mapping SS/PBCH block
indexes to PRACH occasions is the smallest value in the set determined
by the PRACH configuration period according Table 8.1-1 such that
![](media/image389.wmf) SS/PBCH block indexes are mapped at least once
to the PRACH occasions within the association period, where a UE obtains
![](media/image389.wmf) from the value of *ssb-PositionsInBurst* in
*SIB1* or in *ServingCellConfigCommon*. If after an integer number of
SS/PBCH block indexes to PRACH occasions mapping cycles within the
association period there is a set of PRACH occasions or PRACH preambles
that are not mapped to ![](media/image389.wmf) SS/PBCH block indexes, no
SS/PBCH block indexes are mapped to the set of PRACH occasions or PRACH
preambles. An association pattern period includes one or more
association periods and is determined so that a pattern between PRACH
occasions and SS/PBCH block indexes repeats at most every 160 msec.
PRACH occasions not associated with SS/PBCH block indexes after an
integer number of association periods, if any, are not used for PRACH
transmissions.

For a PRACH transmission triggered by a PDCCH order, the PRACH mask
index field \[5, TS 38.212\], if the value of the random access preamble
index field is not zero, indicates the PRACH occasion for the PRACH
transmission where the PRACH occasions are associated with the SS/PBCH
block index indicated by the SS/PBCH block index field of the PDCCH
order.

For a PRACH transmission triggered by higher layers, if
*ssb-ResourceList* is provided, the PRACH mask index is indicated by
*ra-ssb-OccasionMaskIndex* which indicates the PRACH occasions for the
PRACH transmission where the PRACH occasions are associated with the
selected SS/PBCH block index.

The PRACH occasions are mapped consecutively per corresponding SS/PBCH
block index. The indexing of the PRACH occasion indicated by the mask
index value is reset per mapping cycle of consecutive PRACH occasions
per SS/PBCH block index. The UE selects for a PRACH transmission the
PRACH occasion indicated by PRACH mask index value for the indicated
SS/PBCH block index in the first available mapping cycle.

For the indicated preamble index, the ordering of the PRACH occasions is

\- First, in increasing order of frequency resource indexes for
frequency multiplexed PRACH occasions

\- Second, in increasing order of time resource indexes for time
multiplexed PRACH occasions within a PRACH slot

\- Third, in increasing order of indexes for PRACH slots

For a PRACH transmission triggered upon request by higher layers, a
value of *ra-OccasionList* \[12, TS 38.331\], if *csirs-ResourceList* is
provided, indicates a list of PRACH occasions for the PRACH transmission
where the PRACH occasions are associated with the selected CSI-RS index
indicated by *csi-RS*. The indexing of the PRACH occasions indicated by
*ra-OccasionList* is reset per association pattern period.

Table 8.1-1: Mapping between PRACH configuration period and SS/PBCH
block to PRACH occasion association period

  PRACH configuration period (msec)   Association period (number of PRACH configuration periods)
  ----------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------
  10                                  {1, 2, 4, 8, 16}
  20                                  {1, 2, 4, 8}

  160                                 {1}

For paired spectrum or supplementary uplink band all PRACH occasions are
valid.

For unpaired spectrum,

\- if a UE is not provided *tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon*, a PRACH
occasion in a PRACH slot is valid if it does not precede a SS/PBCH block
in the PRACH slot and starts at least $N_{\text{gap}}$ symbols after a
last SS/PBCH block reception symbol, where $N_{\text{gap}}$ is provided
in Table 8.1-2 and, if *channelAccessMode* = \"*semiStatic*\" is
provided, does not overlap with a set of consecutive symbols before the
start of a next channel occupancy time where the UE does not transmit
\[15, TS 37.213\].

\- the candidate SS/PBCH block index of the SS/PBCH block corresponds to
the SS/PBCH block index provided by *ssb-PositionsInBurst* in *SIB1* or
in *ServingCellConfigCommon* , as described in clause 4.1

\- If a UE is provided *tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon*, a PRACH occasion
in a PRACH slot is valid if

\- it is within UL symbols, or

\- it does not precede a SS/PBCH block in the PRACH slot and starts at
least $N_{\text{gap}}$ symbols after a last downlink symbol and at least
$N_{\text{gap}}$ symbols after a last SS/PBCH block symbol, where
$N_{\text{gap}}$ is provided in Table 8.1-2, and if *channelAccessMode*
= \"*semiStatic\"* is provided, does not overlap with a set of
consecutive symbols before the start of a next channel occupancy time
where there shall not be any transmissions, as described in \[15, TS
37.213\]

\- the candidate SS/PBCH block index of the SS/PBCH block corresponds to
the SS/PBCH block index provided by *ssb-PositionsInBurst* in *SIB1* or
in *ServingCellConfigCommon*, as described in clause 4.1.

For preamble format B4 \[4, TS 38.211\],
$N_{\text{gap}} = 0$![](media/image390.wmf){width="0.5277777777777778in"
height="0.21944444444444444in"}.

Table 8.1-2: $\mathbf{N}_{\mathbf{\text{gap}}}$ values for different
preamble SCS $\mathbf{\mu}$

  Preamble SCS                            $$\mathbf{N}_{\mathbf{\text{gap}}}$$
  --------------------------------------- --------------------------------------
  1.25 kHz or 5 kHz                       0
  15 kHz or 30 kHz or 60 kHz or 120 kHz   2

If a random access procedure is initiated by a PDCCH order, the UE, if
requested by higher layers, transmits a PRACH in the selected PRACH
occasion, as described in \[11, TS 38.321\], for which a time between
the last symbol of the PDCCH order reception and the first symbol of the
PRACH transmission is larger than or equal to
$N_{T,2} + \ \mathrm{\Delta}_{\text{BWPSwitching}} + \mathrm{\Delta}_{\text{Delay}} + T_{\text{switch}}$
msec, where

\- $N_{T,2}$ is a time duration of $N_{2}$ symbols corresponding to a
PUSCH preparation time for UE processing capability 1 \[6, TS 38.214\]
assuming $\mu$ corresponds to the smallest SCS configuration between the
SCS configuration of the PDCCH order and the SCS configuration of the
corresponding PRACH transmission

\- $\mathrm{\Delta}_{\text{BWPSwitching}} = 0$ if the active UL BWP does
not change and $\mathrm{\Delta}_{\text{BWPSwitching}}$ is defined in
\[10, TS 38.133\] otherwise

\- $\mathrm{\Delta}_{\text{Delay}} = 0.5$ msec for FR1 and
$\mathrm{\Delta}_{\text{Delay}} = 0.25$ msec for FR2

\- $T_{\text{switch}}$ is a switching gap duration as defined in \[6, TS
38.214\]

For a PRACH transmission using 1.25 kHz or 5 kHz SCS, the UE determines
$N_{2}$ assuming SCS configuration $\mu = 0$.

For single cell operation or for operation with carrier aggregation in a
same frequency band, a UE does not transmit PRACH and PUSCH/PUCCH/SRS in
a same slot with respect to the smallest SCS configuration between the
SCS configuration for the UL BWP with the PRACH and the SCS
configuration for the UL BWP with the PUSCH/PUCCH/SRS transmissions or
when a gap between the first or last symbol of a PRACH transmission in a
first slot is separated by less than $N$ symbols from the last or first
symbol, respectively, of a PUSCH/PUCCH/SRS transmission in a second slot
where $N = 2$ for $\mu = 0$ or $\mu =$1, $N = 4$ for $\mu = 2$ or
$\mu = 3$, and $\mu$ is the smallest SCS configuration between the SCS
configuration for the UL BWP with the PRACH and the SCS configuration
for the UL BWP with the PUSCH/PUCCH/SRS transmissions. For a PUSCH
transmission with repetition Type B, this applies to each actual
repetition for PUSCH transmission \[6, TS 38.214\].

8.1A PUSCH for Type-2 random access procedure
---------------------------------------------

For a Type-2 random access procedure, a UE transmits a PUSCH, when
applicable, after transmitting a PRACH. The UE encodes a transport block
provided for the PUSCH transmission using redundancy version number 0.
The PUSCH transmission is after the PRACH transmission by at least $N$
symbols where $N = 2$ for $\mu = 0$ or $\mu = 1$, $N = 4$ for $\mu = 2$
or $\mu = 3$, and $\mu$ is the SCS configuration for the active UL BWP.

A UE does not transmit a PUSCH in a PUSCH occasion if the PUSCH occasion
associated with a DMRS resource is not mapped to a preamble of valid
PRACH occasions or if the associated PRACH preamble is not transmitted
as described in clause 7.5 or clause 11.1 or clause 15. A UE can
transmit a PRACH preamble in a valid PRACH occasion if the PRACH
preamble is not mapped to a valid PUSCH occasion.

A *mapping between one or multiple PRACH preambles and a PUSCH occasion*
associated with a DMRS resource *is per* PUSCH configuration.

A UE determines time resources and frequency resources for PUSCH
occasions in an active UL BWP from *msgA-PUSCH-Config* for the active UL
BWP. If the active UL BWP is not the initial UL BWP and
*msgA-PUSCH-Config* is not provided for the active UL BWP, the UE uses
the *msgA-PUSCH-Config* provided for the initial UL BWP.

A UE determines a first interlace or first RB for a first PUSCH occasion
in an active UL BWP respectively from *interlaceIndexFirstPO-MsgA-PUSCH*
or from *frequencyStartMsgA-PUSCH that provides an offset, in number of
RBs in the active UL BWP,* from a first RB of the active UL BWP. A PUSCH
occasion includes a number of interlaces or a number of RBs provided by
*nrofInterlacesPerMsgA-PO* or by *nrofPRBs-perMsgA-PO, respectively.
Consecutive PUSCH occasions in the frequency domain of an UL BWP are
separated by a number of RBs provided by guardBandMsgA-PUSCH. A number*
$N_{f}\mathbf{\ }$*of PUSCH occasions in the frequency domain of an UL
BWP is provided by nrofMsgA-PO-FDM.*

For operation with shared spectrum channel access, if the PUSCH occasion
is provided by higher layer parameters *frequencyStartMsgA-PUSCH* and
*nrofPRBs-perMsgA-PO*, the UE expects a PUSCH occasion to be confined
within the same RB set as the corresponding PRACH transmission.

For operation with shared spectrum channel access, if the PUSCH occasion
is provided by higher layer parameters
*interlaceIndexFirstPO-MsgA-PUSCH* and *nrofInterlacesPerMsgA-PO*, the
RB set for the PUSCH occasion in the active UL BWP is the same RB set as
the corresponding PRACH transmission. The UE assumes that the RB set is
defined as when the UE is not provided *intraCellGuardBandsPerSCS* for
an UL carrier as described in clause 7 of \[6, TS 38.214\].

*If a UE does not have dedicated RRC configuration, or has an initial UL
BWP as an active UL BWP, or is not provided startSymbolAndLengthMsgA-PO,
msgA-PUSCH-timeDomainAllocation provides a SLIV and a* PUSCH mapping
type for a PUSCH transmission by indicating

\- one of the *first maxNrofUL-Allocations values from
PUSCH-TimeDomainResourceAllocationList*, if
*PUSCH-TimeDomainResourceAllocationList* is provided in
*PUSCH-ConfigCommon*

\- one of the *entries* from table 6.1.2.1.1-2 or table 6.1.2.1.1-3 in
\[6, TS 38.214\], if *PUSCH-TimeDomainResourceAllocationList* is not
provided in *PUSCH-ConfigCommon*

*else, the UE is provided a SLIV by startSymbolAndLengthMsgA-PO, and a*
PUSCH mapping type by *mappingTypeMsgA-PUSCH* for a PUSCH transmission.

For mapping one or multiple preambles of a PRACH slot to a PUSCH
occasion associated with a DMRS resource, a UE determines a first slot
for a first PUSCH occasion in an active UL BWP from
*msgA-PUSCH-TimeDomainOffset that provides* an offset, in number of
slots in the active UL BWP, *relative to the start of a PUSCH slot
including the start of each PRACH slot. The UE does not expect to have a
PRACH preamble transmission and a PUSCH transmission with a msgA in a
PRACH slot or in a PUSCH slot, or to have overlapping msgA PUSCH
occasions for a MsgA PUSCH configuration. The UE expects that a first
PUSCH occasion in each slot has a same SLIV for a PUSCH transmission
that is provided by startSymbolAndLengthMsgA-PO or
msgA-PUSCH-timeDomainAllocation* \[6, TS 38.214*\].*

Consecutive PUSCH occasions within each slot are separated by
*guardPeriodMsgA-PUSCH symbols and have same duration. A* number $N_{t}$
of time domain PUSCH occasions in each slot is provided by
*nrofMsgA-PO-perSlot and a number* $N_{s}$ *of consecutive slots that
include PUSCH occasions is provided by nrofSlotsMsgA-PUSCH.*

A UE is provided a DMRS configuration for a PUSCH transmission in a
PUSCH occasion in an active UL BWP by *msgA-DMRS-Config.*

A UE is provided an MCS for data information in a PUSCH transmission for
a PUSCH occasion by *msgA-MCS*.

For a PUSCH transmission with frequency hopping in a slot, when
indicated by *msgA-intraSlotFrequencyHopping for the active UL BWP*, the
frequency offset for the second hop \[6, TS 38.214\] is determined as
described in clause 8.3, Table 8.3-1 using *msgA-HoppingBits* instead of
$N_{UL,hop}$. If *guardPeriodMsgA-PUSCH is provided,* a first symbol of
the second hop is separated by *guardPeriodMsgA-PUSCH symbols from the
end of a last symbol of the first hop; otherwise, there is no time
separation of the PUSCH transmission before and after frequency
hopping.* If a UE is provided with *useInterlacePUCCH-PUSCH in
BWP-UplinkCommon*, the UE shall transmit PUSCH without frequency
hopping. A PUSCH transmission uses a same spatial filter as an
associated PRACH transmission.

A UE determines whether or not to apply transform precoding for a PUSCH
transmission as described in \[6, TS 38.214\].

A PUSCH occasion for PUSCH transmission is defined by a frequency
resource and a time resource, and is associated with a DMRS resource.
The DMRS resources are provided by *msgA-DMRS-Config*.

Each consecutive number of $N_{\text{preamble}}$ preamble indexes **from
valid PRACH occasions in a PRACH slot**

\- first, in increasing order of preamble indexes within a single PRACH
occasion

\- second, in increasing order of frequency resource indexes for
frequency multiplexed PRACH occasions

\- third, in increasing order of time resource indexes for time
multiplexed PRACH occasions within a PRACH slot

are mapped to a valid PUSCH occasion and the associated DMRS resource

\- first, in increasing order of frequency resource indexes
$f_{\text{id}}$ for frequency multiplexed PUSCH occasions

> \- second, in increasing order of DMRS resource indexes within a PUSCH
> occasion, where a DMRS resource index $\text{DMR}S_{\text{id}}$
> ***is*** determined first in an ascending order of a DMRS port index
> and second in an ascending order of a DMRS sequence index \[4, TS
> 38.211\]

\- third, in increasing order of time resource indexes $t_{\text{id}}$
for time multiplexed PUSCH occasions within a PUSCH slot

\- fourth, in increasing order of indexes for $N_{s}$ PUSCH slots

where
$N_{\text{preamble}} = ceil\left( \frac{T_{\text{preamble}}}{T_{\text{PUSCH}}} \right)$,
$T_{\text{preamble}}$ is a total number of valid PRACH occasions per
association pattern period multiplied by the number of preambles per
valid PRACH occasion provided by *rach-ConfigCommonTwoStepRA*, and
$T_{\text{PUSCH}}$ is a total number of valid PUSCH occasions per PUSCH
configuration per association pattern period multiplied by **the number
of DMRS resource indexes per valid PUSCH occasion** provided by
*msgA-DMRS-Config*.

A PUSCH occasion is valid if it does not overlap in time and frequency
with any valid PRACH occasion associated with either a Type-1 random
access procedure or a Type-2 random access procedure. Additionally, for
unpaired spectrum and for SS/PBCH blocks with indexes provided by
*ssb-PositionsInBurst* in *SIB1* or by *ServingCellConfigCommon*

\- if a UE is not provided *tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon*, a PUSCH
occasion is valid if the PUSCH occasion

\- does not precede a SS/PBCH block in the PUSCH slot, and

\- starts at least $N_{\text{gap}}$ symbols after a last SS/PBCH block
symbol, where $N_{\text{gap}}$ is provided in Table 8.1-2 and, if
*channelAccessMode* = \"*semiStatic*\" is provided, does not overlap
with a set of consecutive symbols before the start of a next channel
occupancy time where the UE does not transmit \[15, TS 37.213\].

\- if a UE is provided *tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon*, a PUSCH occasion
is valid if the PUSCH occasion

\- is within UL symbols, or

\- does not precede a SS/PBCH block in the PUSCH slot, and

\- starts at least $N_{\text{gap}}$ symbols after a last downlink symbol
and at least $N_{\text{gap}}$ symbols after a last SS/PBCH block symbol,
where $N_{\text{gap}}$ is provided in Table 8.1-2 and, if
*channelAccessMode* = \"*semiStatic*\" is provided, does not overlap
with a set of consecutive symbols before the start of a next channel
occupancy time where the UE does not transmit \[15, TS 37.213\].

8.2 Random access response - Type-1 random access procedure
-----------------------------------------------------------

In response to a PRACH transmission, a UE attempts to detect a DCI
format 1\_0 with CRC scrambled by a corresponding RA-RNTI during a
window controlled by higher layers \[11, TS 38.321\]. The window starts
at the first symbol of the earliest CORESET the UE is configured to
receive PDCCH for Type1-PDCCH CSS set, as defined in clause 10.1, that
is at least one symbol, after the last symbol of the PRACH occasion
corresponding to the PRACH transmission, where the symbol duration
corresponds to the SCS for Type1-PDCCH CSS set as defined in clause
10.1. The length of the window in number of slots, based on the SCS for
Type1-PDCCH CSS set, is provided by *ra-ResponseWindow*.

If the UE detects the DCI format 1\_0 with CRC scrambled by the
corresponding RA-RNTI and LSBs of a SFN field in the DCI format 1\_0, if
included and applicable, are same as corresponding LSBs of the SFN where
the UE transmitted PRACH, and the UE receives a transport block in a
corresponding PDSCH within the window, the UE passes the transport block
to higher layers. The higher layers parse the transport block for a
random access preamble identity (RAPID) associated with the PRACH
transmission. If the higher layers identify the RAPID in RAR message(s)
of the transport block, the higher layers indicate an uplink grant to
the physical layer. This is referred to as random access response (RAR)
UL grant in the physical layer.

If the UE does not detect the DCI format 1\_0 with CRC scrambled by the
corresponding RA-RNTI within the window, or if the UE detects the DCI
format 1\_0 with CRC scrambled by the corresponding RA-RNTI within the
window and LSBs of a SFN field in the DCI format 1\_0, if included and
applicable, are not same as corresponding LSBs of the SFN where the UE
transmitted PRACH, or if the UE does not correctly receive the transport
block in the corresponding PDSCH within the window, or if the higher
layers do not identify the RAPID associated with the PRACH transmission
from the UE, the higher layers can indicate to the physical layer to
transmit a PRACH. If requested by higher layers, the UE shall be ready
to transmit a PRACH no later than ![](media/image391.wmf) msec after the
last symbol of the window, or the last symbol of the PDSCH reception,
where ![](media/image392.wmf) is a time duration of
![](media/image393.wmf) symbols corresponding to a PDSCH processing time
for UE processing capability 1 assuming ![](media/image394.wmf)
corresponds to the smallest SCS configuration among the SCS
configurations for the PDCCH carrying the DCI format 1\_0, the
corresponding PDSCH when additional PDSCH DM-RS is configured, and the
corresponding PRACH. For ![](media/image34.wmf), the UE assumes
![](media/image35.wmf) \[6, TS 38.214\]. For a PRACH transmission using
1.25 kHz or 5 kHz SCS, the UE determines ![](media/image393.wmf)
assuming SCS configuration ![](media/image395.wmf).

If the UE detects a DCI format 1\_0 with CRC scrambled by the
corresponding RA-RNTI and LSBs of a SFN field in the DCI format 1\_0, if
included and applicable, are same as corresponding LSBs of the SFN where
the UE transmitted the PRACH, and the UE receives a transport block in a
corresponding PDSCH, the UE may assume same DM-RS antenna port quasi
co-location properties, as described in \[6, TS 38.214\], as for a
SS/PBCH block or a CSI-RS resource the UE used for PRACH association, as
described in clause 8.1, regardless of whether or not the UE is provided
*TCI-State* for the CORESET where the UE receives the PDCCH with the DCI
format 1\_0.

If the UE attempts to detect the DCI format 1\_0 with CRC scrambled by
the corresponding RA-RNTI in response to a PRACH transmission initiated
by a PDCCH order that triggers a contention-free random access procedure
for the SpCell \[11, TS 38.321\], the UE may assume that the PDCCH that
includes the DCI format 1\_0 and the PDCCH order have same DM-RS antenna
port quasi co-location properties. If the UE attempts to detect the DCI
format 1\_0 with CRC scrambled by the corresponding RA-RNTI in response
to a PRACH transmission initiated by a PDCCH order that triggers a
contention-free random access procedure for a secondary cell, the UE may
assume the DM-RS antenna port quasi co-location properties of the
CORESET associated with the Type1-PDCCH CSS set for receiving the PDCCH
that includes the DCI format 1\_0.

A RAR UL grant schedules a PUSCH transmission from the UE. The contents
of the RAR UL grant, starting with the MSB and ending with the LSB, are
given in Table 8.2-1.

If the value of the frequency hopping flag is 0, the UE transmits the
PUSCH without frequency hopping; otherwise, the UE transmits the PUSCH
with frequency hopping.

The UE determines the MCS of the PUSCH transmission from the first
sixteen indexes of the applicable MCS index table for PUSCH as described
in \[6, TS 38.214\].

The TPC command value ![](media/image396.wmf) is used for setting the
power of the PUSCH transmission, as described in clause 7.1.1, and is
interpreted according to Table 8.2-2.

The CSI request field is reserved.

The ChannelAccess-CPext field indicates a channel access type and CP
extension for operation with shared spectrum channel access \[15, TS
37.213\] as defined in Table 7.3.1.1.1-4 in \[5, TS 38.212\] or Table
7.3.1.1.1-4A in \[5, TS 38.212\] if *channelAccessMode* =
\"*semiStatic*\" is provided.

Unless the UE is configured a SCS, the UE receives subsequent PDSCH
using same SCS as for the PDSCH reception providing the RAR message.

If the UE does not detect the DCI format 1\_0 with CRC scrambled by the
corresponding RA-RNTI within the window, or if the UE detects the DCI
format 1\_0 with CRC scrambled by the corresponding RA-RNTI within the
window and the LSBs of a SFN field in the DCI format 1\_0, if included
and applicable, are not same as corresponding LSBs of the SFN where the
UE transmitted the PRACH, or the UE does not correctly receive a
corresponding transport block within the window, the UE procedure is as
described in \[11, TS 38.321\].

8.2A Random access response - Type-2 random access procedure
------------------------------------------------------------

In response to a transmission of a PRACH and a PUSCH, or to a
transmission of only a PRACH if the PRACH preamble is mapped to a valid
PUSCH occasion, a UE attempts to detect a DCI format 1\_0 with CRC
scrambled by a corresponding MsgB-RNTI during a window controlled by
higher layers \[11, TS 38.321\]. The window starts at the first symbol
of the earliest CORESET the UE is configured to receive PDCCH for
Type1-PDCCH CSS set, as defined in clause 10.1, that is at least one
symbol, after the last symbol of the PUSCH occasion corresponding to the
PRACH transmission, where the symbol duration corresponds to the SCS for
Type1-PDCCH CSS set. The length of the window in number of slots, based
on the SCS for Type1-PDCCH CSS set, is provided by
*msgB-ResponseWindow*.

In response to a transmission of a PRACH, if the PRACH preamble is not
mapped to a valid PUSCH occasion, a UE attempts to detect a DCI format
1\_0 with CRC scrambled by a corresponding MsgB-RNTI during a window
controlled by higher layers \[11, TS 38.321\]. The window starts at the
first symbol of the earliest CORESET the UE is configured to receive
PDCCH for Type1-PDCCH CSS set, as defined in clause 10.1, that is at
least one symbol, after the last symbol of the PRACH occasion
corresponding to the PRACH transmission, where the symbol duration
corresponds to the SCS for Type1-PDCCH CSS set. The length of the window
in number of slots, based on the SCS for Type1-PDCCH CSS set, is
provided by *msgB-ResponseWindow*.

If the UE detects the DCI format 1\_0, with CRC scrambled by the
corresponding MsgB-RNTI and LSBs of a SFN field in the DCI format 1\_0,
if applicable, are same as corresponding LSBs of the SFN where the UE
transmitted PRACH, and the UE receives a transport block in a
corresponding PDSCH within the window, the UE passes the transport block
to higher layers. The higher layers indicate to the physical layer

\- an uplink grant if the RAR message(s) is for fallbackRAR and a random
access preamble identity (RAPID) associated with the PRACH transmission
is identified, and the UE procedure continues as described in clauses
8.2, 8.3, and 8.4 when the UE detects a RAR UL grant, or

\- transmission of a PUCCH with HARQ-ACK information having ACK value if
the RAR message(s) is for successRAR, where

\- a PUCCH resource for the transmission of the PUCCH is indicated by
PUCCH resource indicator field of 4 bits in the successRAR from a PUCCH
resource set that is provided by *pucch-ResourceCommon*

\- a slot for the PUCCH transmission is indicated by a HARQ Feedback
Timing Indicator field of 3 bits in the successRAR having a value $k$
from {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8} and, with reference to slots for PUCCH
transmission having duration $T_{\text{slot}}$, the slot is determined
as $n + k + \mathrm{\Delta}$, where $n$ is a slot of the PDSCH reception
and $\mathrm{\Delta}$ is as defined for PUSCH transmission in Table
6.1.2.1.1-5 of \[6, TS 38.214\]

\- the UE does not expect the first symbol of the PUCCH transmission to
be after the last symbol of the PDSCH reception by a time smaller than
$N_{T,1} + 0.5$ msec where $N_{T,1}$ is the PDSCH processing time for UE
processing capability 1 \[6, TS 38.214\]

\- for operation with shared spectrum channel access, a channel access
type and CP extension \[15, TS 37.213\] for a PUCCH transmission is
indicated by a ChannelAccess-CPext field in the successRAR as defined in
Table 7.3.1.1.1-4 in \[5, TS 38.212\] or Table 7.3.1.1.1-4A in \[5, TS
38.212\] if *channelAccessMode* = \"*semiStatic*\" is provided

\- the PUCCH transmission is with a same spatial domain transmission
filter and in a same active UL BWP **as a last PUSCH transmission**

If the UE detects the DCI format 1\_0 with CRC scrambled by a C-RNTI and
a transport block in a corresponding PDSCH within the window, the UE
transmits a PUCCH with HARQ-ACK information having ACK value if the UE
correctly detects the transport block or NACK value if the UE
incorrectly detects the transport block and the time alignment timer is
running \[11, TS 38.321\].

If the UE detects a DCI format 1\_0 with CRC scrambled by the
corresponding MsgB-RNTI and receives a transport block within the window
in a corresponding PDSCH, the UE may assume same DM-RS antenna port
quasi co-location properties, as described in \[6, TS 38.214\], as for a
SS/PBCH block the UE used for PRACH association, as described in clause
8.1, regardless of whether or not the UE is provided *TCI-State* for the
CORESET where the UE receives the PDCCH with the DCI format 1\_0.

The UE does not expect to be indicated to transmit the PUCCH with the
HARQ-ACK information at a time that is prior to a time when the UE
applies a TA command that is provided by the transport block. If the UE
does not detect the DCI format 1\_0 with CRC scrambled by the
corresponding MsgB-RNTI within the window, or if the UE detects the DCI
format 1\_0 with CRC scrambled by the corresponding MsgB-RNTI within the
window and LSBs of a SFN field in the DCI format 1\_0, if applicable,
are not same as corresponding LSBs of the SFN where the UE transmitted
the PRACH, or if the UE does not correctly receive the transport block
in the corresponding PDSCH within the window, or if the higher layers do
not identify the RAPID associated with the PRACH transmission from the
UE, the higher layers can indicate to the physical layer to transmit
only PRACH according to Type-1 random access procedure or to transmit
both PRACH and PUSCH according to Type-2 random access procedure \[11,
TS 38.321\]. If requested by higher layers, the UE shall be ready to
transmit a PRACH no later than $N_{\text{T,1}} + 0.75$ msec after the
last symbol of the window, or the last symbol of the PDSCH reception,
where $N_{\text{T,1}}$ is a time duration of $N_{1}$ symbols
corresponding to a PDSCH processing time for UE processing capability 1
when additional PDSCH DM-RS is configured. For $\mu = 0$, the UE assumes
$N_{\text{1,0}} = 14$ \[6, TS 38.214\].

Unless the UE is configured a SCS, the UE receives subsequent PDSCH
using same SCS as for the PDSCH reception providing the RAR message.

If the UE does not detect the DCI format 1\_0 with CRC scrambled by the
corresponding MsgB-RNTI within the window, or if the UE detects the 1\_0
with CRC scrambled by the corresponding MsgB-RNTI within the window and
LSBs of a SFN field in the DCI format 1\_0, if applicable, are not same
as corresponding LSBs of the SFN where the UE transmitted the PRACH, or
the UE does not correctly receive a corresponding transport block within
the window, the UE procedure is as described in \[11, TS 38.321\].

8.3 PUSCH scheduled by RAR UL grant
-----------------------------------

An active UL BWP, as described in clause 12 and in \[4, TS 38.211\], for
a PUSCH transmission scheduled by a RAR UL grant is indicated by higher
layers.

If *useInterlacePUCCH-PUSCH* is not provided by *BWP-UplinkCommon* and
*BWP-UplinkDedicated*, for determining the frequency domain resource
allocation for the PUSCH transmission within the active UL BWP

\- if the active UL BWP and the initial UL BWP have same SCS and same CP
length and the active UL BWP includes all RBs of the initial UL BWP, or
the active UL BWP is the initial UL BWP, the initial UL BWP is used

\- else, the RB numbering starts from the first RB of the active UL BWP
and the maximum number of RBs for frequency domain resource allocation
equals the number of RBs in the initial UL BWP

The frequency domain resource allocation is by uplink resource
allocation type 1 \[6, TS 38.214\]. For an initial UL BWP size of
$N_{\text{BWP}}^{\text{size}}$ RBs, a UE processes the frequency domain
resource assignment field as follows

\- if $N_{\text{BWP}}^{\text{size}} \leq 180$, or for operation with
shared spectrum channel access if $N_{\text{BWP}}^{\text{size}} \leq 90$

\- truncate the frequency domain resource assignment field to its
$\left\lceil \text{log}_{2}\left( \frac{N_{\text{BWP}}^{\text{size}} \bullet \left( N_{\text{BWP}}^{\text{size}} + 1 \right)}{2} \right) \right\rceil$
least significant bits and interpret the truncated frequency resource
assignment field as for the frequency resource assignment field in DCI
format 0\_0 as described in \[5, TS 38.212\]

\- else

\- insert
$\left\lceil \text{log}_{2}\left( \frac{N_{\text{BWP}}^{\text{size}} \bullet \left( N_{\text{BWP}}^{\text{size}} + 1 \right)}{2} \right) \right\rceil - 14$
most significant bits, or for operation with shared spectrum channel
access insert
$\left\lceil \text{log}_{2}\left( \frac{N_{\text{BWP}}^{\text{size}} \bullet \left( N_{\text{BWP}}^{\text{size}} + 1 \right)}{2} \right) \right\rceil - 12$
most significant bits, with value set to \'0\' after the $N_{UL,hop}$
bits to the frequency domain resource assignment field, where
$N_{UL,hop} = 0$ if the frequency hopping flag is set to \'0\' and
$N_{UL,hop}$ is provided in Table 8.3-1 if the hopping flag bit is set
to \'1\', and interpret the expanded frequency resource assignment field
as for the frequency resource assignment field in DCI format 0\_0 as
described in \[5, TS 38.212\]

\- end if

If *useInterlacePUCCH-PUSCH* is provided by *BWP-UplinkCommon* or
*BWP-UplinkDedicated*, the frequency domain resource allocation is by
uplink resource allocation type 2 \[6, TS 38.214\]. A UE processes the
frequency domain resource assignment field as follows

\- truncate the frequency domain resource assignment field to the
$X = 6$ LSBs if $\mu = 0$, or to the $X = 5$ LSBs if $\mu = 1$

\- for interlace allocation of a PUSCH transmission, interpret the $X$
MSBs of the truncated frequency domain resource assignment field for the
active UL BWP as for the $X$ MSBs of the frequency domain resource
assignment field in DCI format 0\_0 \[6, TS 38.214\]

\- for RB set allocation of a PUSCH transmission, the RB set of the
active UL BWP is the RB set of the PRACH transmission associated with
the RAR UL grant. The UE assumes that the RB set is defined as when the
UE is not provided *intraCellGuardBandsUL-List* \[6, TS 38.214\]*.*

A UE determines whether or not to apply transform precoding as described
in \[6, TS 38.214\].

For a PUSCH transmission with frequency hopping scheduled by RAR UL
grant or for a Msg3 PUSCH retransmission, the frequency offset for the
second hop \[6, TS 38.214\] is given in Table 8.3-1.

Table 8.3-1: Frequency offset for second hop of PUSCH transmission with
frequency hopping scheduled by RAR UL grant or of Msg3 PUSCH
retransmission

  **Number of PRBs in initial UL BWP**       Value of $\mathbf{N}_{\mathbf{UL,hop}}$ Hopping Bits   Frequency offset for 2^nd^ hop

  $$N_{\text{BWP}}^{\text{size}} < 50$$      0                                                      $$\left\lfloor \frac{N_{\text{BWP}}^{\text{size}}}{2} \right\rfloor$$
                                             1                                                      $$\left\lfloor \frac{N_{\text{BWP}}^{\text{size}}}{4} \right\rfloor$$
  $$N_{\text{BWP}}^{\text{size}} \geq 50$$   00                                                     $$\left\lfloor \frac{N_{\text{BWP}}^{\text{size}}}{2} \right\rfloor$$
                                             01                                                     $$\left\lfloor \frac{N_{\text{BWP}}^{\text{size}}}{4} \right\rfloor$$
                                             10                                                     $$- \left\lfloor \frac{N_{\text{BWP}}^{\text{size}}}{4} \right\rfloor$$
                                             11                                                     Reserved

A SCS for the PUSCH transmission is provided by *subcarrierSpacing* in
*BWP-UplinkCommon*. A UE transmits PRACH and the PUSCH on a same uplink
carrier of a same serving cell.

A UE transmits a transport block in a PUSCH scheduled by a RAR UL grant
in a corresponding RAR message using redundancy version number 0. If a
TC-RNTI is provided by higher layers, the scrambling initialization of
the PUSCH corresponding to the RAR UL grant in clause 8.2 is by TC-RNTI.
Otherwise, the scrambling initialization of the PUSCH corresponding to
the RAR UL grant in clause 8.2 is by C-RNTI. Msg3 PUSCH retransmissions,
if any, of the transport block, are scheduled by a DCI format 0\_0 with
CRC scrambled by a TC-RNTI provided in the corresponding RAR message
\[11, TS 38.321\]. The UE always transmits the PUSCH scheduled by a RAR
UL grant without repetitions[.]{.underline}

With reference to slots for a PUSCH transmission scheduled by a RAR UL
grant, if a UE receives a PDSCH with a RAR message ending in slot $n$
for a corresponding PRACH transmission from the UE, the UE transmits the
PUSCH in slot $n + k_{2} + \mathrm{\Delta}$, where $k_{2}$ and
$\mathrm{\Delta}$ are provided in \[6, TS 38.214\].

The UE may assume a minimum time between the last symbol of a PDSCH
reception conveying a RAR message with a RAR UL grant and the first
symbol of a corresponding PUSCH transmission scheduled by the RAR UL
grant is equal to $N_{T,1} + N_{T,2} + 0.5$ msec, where $N_{T,1}$ is a
time duration of $N_{1}$ symbols corresponding to a PDSCH processing
time for UE processing capability 1 when additional PDSCH DM-RS is
configured, $N_{T,2}$ is a time duration of $N_{2}$ symbols
corresponding to a PUSCH preparation time for UE processing capability 1
\[6, TS 38.214\] and, for determining the minimum time, the UE considers
that $N_{1}$ and $N_{2}$ correspond to the smaller of the SCS
configurations for the PDSCH and the PUSCH. For $\mu = 0$, the UE
assumes $N_{1,0} = 14$ \[6, TS 38.214\].

8.4 PDSCH with UE contention resolution identity
------------------------------------------------

In response to a PUSCH transmission scheduled by a RAR UL grant when a
UE has not been provided a C-RNTI, the UE attempts to detect a DCI
format 1\_0 with CRC scrambled by a corresponding TC-RNTI scheduling a
PDSCH that includes a UE contention resolution identity \[11, TS
38.321\]. In response to the PDSCH reception with the UE contention
resolution identity, the UE transmits HARQ-ACK information in a PUCCH.
The PUCCH transmission is within a same active UL BWP as the PUSCH
transmission. A minimum time between the last symbol of the PDSCH
reception and the first symbol of the corresponding PUCCH transmission
with the HARQ-ACK information is equal to ![](media/image397.wmf) msec.
![](media/image398.wmf) is a time duration of ![](media/image399.wmf)
symbols corresponding to a PDSCH processing time for UE processing
capability 1 when additional PDSCH DM-RS is configured. For
![](media/image34.wmf), the UE assumes ![](media/image35.wmf) \[6, TS
38.214\].

When detecting a DCI format in response to a PUSCH transmission
scheduled by a RAR UL grant, as described in \[11, TS 38.321\], or
corresponding PUSCH retransmission scheduled by a DCI format 0\_0 with
CRC scrambled by a TC-RNTI provided in the corresponding RAR message
\[11, TS 38.321\], the UE may assume the PDCCH carrying the DCI format
has the same DM-RS antenna port quasi co-location properties, as
described in \[6, TS 38.214\], as for a SS/PBCH block the UE used for
PRACH association, as described in clause 8.1, regardless of whether or
not the UE is provided TCI-State for the CORESET where the UE receives
the PDCCH with the DCI format.

9 UE procedure for reporting control information
================================================

If a UE is configured with a SCG, the UE shall apply the procedures
described in this clause for both MCG and SCG.

\- When the procedures are applied for MCG, the terms \'secondary
cell\', \'secondary cells\' , \'serving cell\', \'serving cells\' in
this clause refer to secondary cell, secondary cells, serving cell,
serving cells belonging to the MCG respectively.

\- When the procedures are applied for SCG, the terms \'secondary
cell\', \'secondary cells\', \'serving cell\', \'serving cells\' in this
clause refer to secondary cell, secondary cells (not including PSCell),
serving cell, serving cells belonging to the SCG respectively. The term
\'primary cell\' in this clause refers to the PSCell of the SCG.

If a UE is configured with a PUCCH-SCell, the UE shall apply the
procedures described in this clause for both primary PUCCH group and
secondary PUCCH group

\- When the procedures are applied for the primary PUCCH group, the
terms \'secondary cell\', \'secondary cells\' , \'serving cell\',
\'serving cells\' in this clause refer to secondary cell, secondary
cells, serving cell, serving cells belonging to the primary PUCCH group
respectively.

\- When the procedures are applied for secondary PUCCH group, the terms
\'secondary cell\', \'secondary cells\', \'serving cell\', \'serving
cells\' in this clause refer to secondary cell, secondary cells (not
including the PUCCH-SCell), serving cell, serving cells belonging to the
secondary PUCCH group respectively. The term \'primary cell\' in this
clause refers to the PUCCH-SCell of the secondary PUCCH group. If
*pdsch-HARQ-ACK-Codebook-secondaryPUCCHgroup-r16* is provided,
*pdsch-HARQ-ACK-Codebook* is replaced by
*pdsch-HARQ-ACK-Codebook-secondaryPUCCHgroup-r16*. If
*harq-ACK-SpatialBundlingPUCCH-secondaryPUCCHgroup* is provided,
*harq-ACK-SpatialBundlingPUCCH* is replaced by
*harq-ACK-SpatialBundlingPUCCH-secondaryPUCCHgroup*. If
*harq-ACK-SpatialBundlingPUSCH-secondaryPUCCHgroup* is provided,
*harq-ACK-SpatialBundlingPUSCH* is replaced by
*harq-ACK-SpatialBundlingPUSCH-secondaryPUCCHgroup*.

If a UE is provided *pdsch-HARQ-ACK-CodebookList-r16,
pdsch-HARQ-ACK-Codebook is replaced by the relevant entry in
pdsch-HARQ-ACK-CodebookList-r16*.

If a UE

\- is not provided *coresetPoolIndex* or is provided *coresetPoolIndex*
with a value of 0 for first CORESETs on active DL BWPs of serving cells,
and

\- is provided *coresetPoolIndex* with a value of 1 for second CORESETs
on active DL BWPs of the serving cells, and

\- is provided *ackNackFeedbackMode* = *separate*

the UE shall separately apply the procedures described in clauses 9.1
and 9.2.3 for reporting HARQ-ACK information associated with the first
CORESETs on active DL BWP of the serving cells and for reporting
HARQ-ACK information associated with the second CORESETs on active DL
BWP of the serving cells, and the UE does not expect to be provided with
*subslotLengthForPUCCH* or to be indicated by
*pdsch-HARQ-ACK-CodebookList* to generate two HARQ-ACK codebooks on
active DL BWP of the serving cells. HARQ-ACK information reporting is
associated with a CORESET through a reception of a PDCCH with a DCI
format triggering the reporting of the HARQ-ACK information by the UE.

For NR-DC when both the MCG and the SCG operate either in FR1 or in FR2
and for a power headroom report transmitted on the MCG or the SCG, the
UE computes *PH* assuming that the UE does not transmit PUSCH/PUCCH on
any serving cell of the SCG or the MCG, respectively.

If a UE is configured for NR-DC operation, the UE does not expect to be
configured with a PUCCH-SCell.

A PUSCH or a PUCCH transmission other than PUCCH transmissions with SL
HARQ-ACK reports, including repetitions if any, can be of priority index
0 or of priority index 1. For a configured grant PUSCH transmission, a
UE determines a priority index from *phy-PriorityIndex*, if provided.
For a PUCCH transmission with HARQ-ACK information corresponding to a
SPS PDSCH reception or a SPS PDSCH release, a UE determines a priority
index from *harq-CodebookID*, if provided. For a PUCCH transmission with
SR, a UE determines the corresponding priority as described in clause
9.2.4. For a PUSCH transmission with semi-persistent CSI report, a UE
determines a priority index from a priority indicator field, if
provided, in a DCI format that activates the semi-persistent CSI report.
If a priority index is not provided to a UE for a PUSCH or a PUCCH
transmission other than PUCCH transmissions with SL HARQ-ACK reports,
the priority index is 0.

If a UE is provided one *PUCCH-Config*

\- if the UE is provided *subslotLengthForPUCCH* in the *PUCCH-Config*,
the PUCCH resource for any SR configuration with priority index 0 or any
CSI report configuration in the *PUCCH-Config* is within the
*subslotLengthForPUCCH* symbols in the *PUCCH-Config*

If a UE is provided two *PUCCH-Config*

\- if the UE is provided *subslotLengthForPUCCH* in the first
*PUCCH-Config*, the PUCCH resource for any SR configuration with
priority index 0 or any CSI report configuration in any *PUCCH-Config*
is within the *subslotLengthForPUCCH* symbols in the first
*PUCCH-Config*

\- if the UE is provided *subslotLengthForPUCCH* in the second
*PUCCH-Config*, the PUCCH resource for any SR configuration with
priority index 1 in any *PUCCH-Config* is within the
*subslotLengthForPUCCH* symbols in the second *PUCCH-Config*

If a UE is provided *subslotLengthForPUCCH* in a *PUCCH-Config* of a
given priority index, in a slot of $N_{\text{sym}}^{\text{slot}}$
symbols \[4, TS 38.211\] with HARQ-ACK, the UE does not expect that
HARQ-ACK information in response to SPS PDSCH reception(s) only (if any)
or SR (if any) of the given priority index in a slot of
*subslotLengthForPUCCH* symbols is moved to a different slot of
*subslotLengthForPUCCH* symbols after multiplexing overlapping PUCCHs.

If in an active DL BWP a UE monitors PDCCH either for detection of DCI
format 0\_1 and DCI format 1\_1 or for detection of DCI format 0\_2 and
DCI format 1\_2, a priority index can be provided by a priority
indicator field. If a UE indicates a capability to monitor, in an active
DL BWP, PDCCH for detection of DCI format 0\_1 and DCI format 1\_1 and
for detection of DCI format 0\_2 and DCI format 1\_2, a DCI format 0\_1
or a DCI format 0\_2 can schedule a PUSCH transmission of any priority,
a DCI format 1\_1 or a DCI format 1\_2 can schedule a PDSCH reception
and trigger a PUCCH transmission with corresponding HARQ-ACK information
of any priority and a DCI format 1\_1 can indicate SCell dormancy and
trigger a PUCCH transmission with corresponding HARQ-ACK information of
any priority.

When a UE determines overlapping for PUCCH transmissions with SL
HARQ-ACK reports and PUCCH of larger and/or smaller priority index, the
UE resolves the overlapping for PUCCH transmissions with SL HARQ-ACK
reports and PUCCH of each priority index as described in clause 9.2.5
and 9.2.6 before resolving the overlapping for PUCCH transmissions
without SL HARQ-ACK or the overlapping for PUCCH transmissions and PUSCH
transmissions.

When a UE determines overlapping for PUCCH and/or PUSCH transmissions of
the same priority index other than PUCCH transmissions with SL HARQ-ACK
reports before considering limitations for UE transmission as described
in clauses 11.1, 11.1.1, 11.2A and 15, including repetitions if any,

\- first, the UE resolves the overlapping for PUCCHs with repetitions as
described in clause 9.2.6, if any

\- second, the UE resolves the overlapping for PUCCHs without
repetitions as described in clauses 9.2.5

\- third, the UE resolves the overlapping for PUSCHs and PUCCHs with
repetitions as described in clause 9.2.6

\- fourth, the UE resolves the overlapping for PUSCHs and PUCCHs without
repetitions as is subsequently described in this clause.

When a UE determines overlapping for PUCCH and/or PUSCH transmissions of
different priority indexes other than PUCCH transmissions with SL
HARQ-ACK reports before considering limitations for UE transmission as
described in clauses 11.1, 11.1.1, 11.2A and 15, including repetitions
if any, the UE first resolves the overlapping for PUCCH and/or PUSCH
transmissions of smaller priority index as described in clauses 9.2.5
and 9.2.6. Then,

\- if a transmission of a first PUCCH of larger priority index scheduled
by a DCI format in a PDCCH reception would overlap in time with a
repetition of a transmission of a second PUSCH or a second PUCCH of
smaller priority index, the UE cancels the repetition of a transmission
of the second PUSCH or the second PUCCH before the first symbol that
would overlap with the first PUCCH transmission

\- if a transmission of a first PUSCH of larger priority index scheduled
by a DCI format in a PDCCH reception would overlap in time with a
repetition of the transmission of a second PUCCH of smaller priority
index, the UE cancels the repetition of the transmission of the second
PUCCH before the first symbol that would overlap with the first PUSCH
transmission

where

\- the overlapping is applicable before or after resolving overlapping
among channels of larger priority index, if any, as described in clauses
9.2.5 and 9.2.6

\- any remaining PUCCH and/or PUSCH transmission after overlapping
resolution is subjected to the limitations for UE transmission as
described in clauses 11.1, 11.1.1, 11.2A and 15

\- the UE expects that the transmission of the first PUCCH or the first
PUSCH, respectively, would not start before $T_{proc,2}$ after a last
symbol of the corresponding PDCCH reception

\- $T_{proc,2}\ $is the PUSCH preparation time for a corresponding UE
processing capability assuming $d_{2,1} = \ d_{1}$ \[6, TS 38.214\],
based on $\mu$ and $N_{2}$ as subsequently defined in this clause, and
$d_{1}$ is determined by a reported UE capability

If a UE is scheduled by a DCI format in a first PDCCH reception to
transmit a first PUCCH or a first PUSCH of larger priority index that
overlaps with a second PUCCH or a second PUSCH transmission of smaller
priority index that, if any, is scheduled by a DCI format in a second
PDCCH

\- $T_{proc,2}$ is based on a value of $\mu$ corresponding to the
smallest SCS configuration of the first PDCCH, the second PDCCHs, the
first PUCCH or the first PUSCH, and the second PUCCHs or the second
PUSCHs

\- if the overlapping group includes the first PUCCH

\- if *processingType2Enabled* of *PDSCH-ServingCellConfig* is set to
*enable* for the serving cell where the UE receives the first PDCCH and
for all serving cells where the UE receives the PDSCHs corresponding to
the second PUCCHs, and if *processingType2Enabled* of
*PUSCH-ServingCellConfig* is set to *enable* for the serving cells with
the second PUSCHs, $N_{2}\ $is 5 for $\mu = 0$, 5.5 for $\mu = 1$ and 11
for $\mu = 2$

\- else, $N_{2}\ $is 10 for $\mu$=0*,* 12 for $\mu = 1$, 23 for
$\mu = 2$, and 36 for $\mu = 3$;

\- if the overlapping group includes the first PUSCH

\- if *processingType2Enabled* of *PUSCH-ServingCellConfig* is set to
*enable* for the serving cells with the first PUSCH and the second
PUSCHs and if *processingType2Enabled* of *PDSCH-ServingCellConfig* is
set to *enable* for all serving cells where the UE receives the PDSCHs
corresponding to the second PUCCHs, $N_{2}\ $is 5 for $\mu = 0$, 5.5 for
$\mu = 1$ and 11 for $\mu = 2$

\- else, $N_{2}\ $is 10 for $\mu$=0*,* 12 for $\mu = 1$, 23 for
$\mu = 2$, and 36 for $\mu = 3$;

If a PUSCH of larger priority index scheduled by a DCI format overlaps
in time with a PUSCH of smaller priority index with SP-CSI report(s)
without a corresponding PDCCH in one or more symbols on the same
carrier, and if the earliest symbol of these PUSCH channels starts no
earlier than N~2~+d~2,1~ symbols after the last symbol of the DCI
scheduling the PUSCH of larger priority index where d~2,1~ is the
maximum of the d~2,1~ associated with PUSCH of larger priority index
scheduled by a DCI format and the PUSCH of smaller priority index with
SP-CSI report(s) without a corresponding PDCCH, the PUSCH of smaller
priority index with SP-CSI report(s) shall not be transmitted by the UE.
Otherwise, if the timeline requirement is not satisfied this is an error
case.

If a UE would transmit the following channels, including repetitions if
any, that would overlap in time

\- a first PUCCH of larger priority index with SR and a second PUCCH or
PUSCH of smaller priority index, or

\- a configured grant PUSCH of larger priority index and a PUCCH of
smaller priority index, or

\- a first PUCCH of larger priority index with HARQ-ACK information only
in response to PDSCH(s) reception without corresponding PDCCH(s) and a
second PUCCH of smaller priority index with HARQ-ACK information only in
response to PDSCH(s) reception without corresponding PDCCH(s), or a
second PUCCH of smaller priority index with SR and/or CSI, or a
configured grant PUSCH with smaller priority index, or a PUSCH of
smaller priority index with SP-CSI report(s) without a corresponding
PDCCH, or

\- a PUSCH of larger priority index with SP-CSI report(s) without a
corresponding PDCCH and a PUCCH of smaller priority index with SR, or
CSI, or HARQ-ACK information only in response to PDSCH(s) reception
without corresponding PDCCH(s), or

\- a configured grant PUSCH of larger priority index and a configured
grant PUSCH of smaller priority index or a PUSCH of smaller priority
index with SP-CSI report(s) without a corresponding PDCCH on a same
serving cell

\- a PUSCH of larger priority index with SP-CSI report(s) without a
corresponding PDCCH and a configured grant PUSCH of smaller priority
index or a PUSCH of smaller priority index with SP-CSI report(s) without
a corresponding PDCCH on a same serving cell

the UE is expected to cancel a repetition of the PUCCH/PUSCH
transmissions of smaller priority index before the first symbol
overlapping with the PUCCH/PUSCH transmission of larger priority index
if the repetition of the PUCCH/PUSCH transmissions of smaller priority
index overlaps in time with the PUCCH/PUSCH transmissions of larger
priority index.

When a UE determines overlapping for PUCCH transmissions with SL
HARQ-ACK reports and PUSCH of smaller priority index, including
repetitions if any, after resolving the overlapping PUCCH other than
PUCCH transmissions with SL HARQ-ACK reports and/or PUSCH transmissions,
if the PUSCH includes no UCI, the UE resolves the overlapping for PUCCH
transmissions with SL HARQ-ACK reports and PUSCH of smaller priority
index as described in clauses 9.2.5 and 9.2.6.

When a UE determines overlapping for PUCCH transmissions with SL
HARQ-ACK reports and PUSCH of larger priority index only, including
repetitions if any, after resolving the overlapping PUCCH other than
PUCCH transmissions with SL HARQ-ACK reports and/or PUSCH transmissions,
the UE does not transmit the PUCCH with SL HARQ-ACK reports

where

> \- the UE expects that the transmission of the PUSCH would not start
> before $T_{\text{proc},2} + d_{1}$ after a last symbol of the
> corresponding PDCCH reception;
>
> \- $T_{\text{proc},2}\ $is the PUSCH preparation time for a
> corresponding UE processing capability assuming $d_{2,1} = 0$ \[6, TS
> 38.214\], based on $\mu$ and $N_{2}$ as subsequently defined in this
> clause, and $d_{1}$ is determined by a reported UE capability.

The UE expects the PUCCH and PUSCH transmissions fulfill the conditions
in clause 9 and clause 9.2.5 for UCI multiplexing replacing the
reference time of \"end of PDSCH\" with \"end of the last symbol of a
last PSFCH reception occasion\" as described in 16.5 and *T~proc,~*~1~
with *T~prep~*.

A UE does not expect that a PUCCH carrying SL HARQ-ACK reports overlaps
with PUSCH with aperiodic or semi-persistent CSI reports.

A UE does not expect to be scheduled to transmit a PUCCH or a PUSCH with
smaller priority index that would overlap in time with a PUCCH of larger
priority index with HARQ-ACK information only in response to a PDSCH
reception without a corresponding PDCCH. A UE does not expect to be
scheduled to transmit a PUCCH of smaller priority index that would
overlap in time with a PUSCH of larger priority index with SP-CSI
report(s) without a corresponding PDCCH.

In the remaining of this clause, a UE multiplexes UCIs with same
priority index in a PUCCH or a PUSCH before considering limitations for
UE transmission as described in clauses 11.1, 11.1.1, 11.2A and 15. A
PUCCH or a PUSCH is assumed to have a same priority index as a priority
index of UCIs a UE multiplexes in the PUCCH or the PUSCH.

In the remaining of this clause, the multiplexing or prioritization for
overlapping channels are for overlapping channels with same priority
index or for overlapping channels with a PUCCH carrying SL HARQ-ACK
information.

In the remaining of this clause, if a UE is provided
*subslotLengthForPUCCH*, a slot for an associated PUCCH resource of a
PUCCH transmission with HARQ-ACK information includes a number of
symbols indicated by *subslotLengthForPUCCH, unless stated otherwise*.

If a UE would transmit on a serving cell a PUSCH without UL-SCH that
overlaps with a PUCCH transmission on a serving cell that includes
positive SR information, the UE does not transmit the PUSCH.

If a UE would transmit CSI reports on overlapping physical channels, the
UE applies the priority rules described in \[6, TS 38.214\] for the
multiplexing of CSI reports.

If a UE

\- would multiplex UCI in a PUCCH transmission that overlaps with a
PUSCH transmission, and

\- the PUSCH and PUCCH transmissions fulfil the conditions in clause
9.2.5 for UCI multiplexing,

the UE

\- multiplexes only HARQ-ACK information, if any, from the UCI in the
PUSCH transmission and does not transmit the PUCCH if the UE multiplexes
aperiodic or semi-persistent CSI reports in the PUSCH;

\- multiplexes only HARQ-ACK information and CSI reports, if any, from
the UCI in the PUSCH transmission and does not transmit the PUCCH if the
UE does not multiplex aperiodic or semi-persistent CSI reports in the
PUSCH.

A UE does not expect to multiplex in a PUSCH transmission in one slot
with SCS configuration $\mu_{1}$ UCI of same type that the UE would
transmit in PUCCHs in different slots with SCS configuration $\mu_{2}$
if $\mu_{1} < \mu_{2}$.

A UE does not expect to multiplex in a PUSCH transmission or in a PUCCH
transmission HARQ-ACK information that the UE would transmit in
different PUCCHs.

**A UE does not expect a PUCCH resource that results from multiplexing
overlapped PUCCH resources, if applicable, to overlap with more than one
PUSCHs if each of the more than one PUSCHs includes** aperiodic CSI
reports.

A UE does not expect to detect a DCI format scheduling a PDSCH reception
or a SPS PDSCH release, a DCI format 1\_1 indicating SCell dormancy, or
a DCI format including a One-shot HARQ-ACK request field with value 1,
and indicating a resource for a PUCCH transmission with corresponding
HARQ-ACK information in a slot if the UE previously detects a DCI format
scheduling a PUSCH transmission in the slot and if the UE multiplexes
HARQ-ACK information in the PUSCH transmission.

If a UE multiplexes aperiodic CSI in a PUSCH and the UE would multiplex
UCI that includes HARQ-ACK information in a PUCCH that overlaps with the
PUSCH and the timing conditions for overlapping PUCCHs and PUSCHs in
clause 9.2.5 are fulfilled, the UE multiplexes only the HARQ-ACK
information in the PUSCH and does not transmit the PUCCH.

When a UE transmits multiple PUSCHs on respective serving cells in a
slot with reference to slots for PUCCH transmissions and the multiple
PUSCHs overlap with a PUCCH carrying UCI in the slot, the UE selects all
the PUSCHs overlapping with the PUCCH as the candidate PUSCHs for UCI
multiplexing within the slot.

If a UE would transmit a single PUSCH scheduled by a DCI format that
includes a DAI field on a serving cell in a slot with reference to slots
for PUCCH transmissions without any other PUSCH that would be
transmitted on any serving cell in the slot and the UE does not
determine any PUCCH carrying HARQ-ACK information in the slot, or if the
UE indicates the corresponding capability
*mux-HARQ-ACK-withoutPUCCH-onPUSCH* and the UE transmits multiple PUSCHs
on respective serving cells in a slot with reference to slots for PUCCH
transmissions and the UE does not determine any PUCCH carrying HARQ-ACK
information in the slot and at least one of the multiple PUSCHs is
scheduled by a DCI format that includes a DAI field, the UE selects the
single PUSCH or all the multiple PUSCHs in the slot as the candidate
PUSCHs for HARQ-ACK multiplexing within the slot except for any PUSCH
among the multiple PUSCHs that is scheduled by a DCI format that
includes a DAI field that is equal to 4 in case the UE is configured
with *pdsch-HARQ-ACK-Codebook = dynamic* or with
*pdsch-HARQ-ACK-Codebook-r16*, or is equal to 0 in case the UE is
configured with *pdsch-HARQ-ACK-Codebook = semi-static*.

The UE determines the PUSCH for UCI multiplexing by applying the
following procedure on the candidate PUSCHs as described in this clause:

\- If the candidate PUSCHs include first PUSCHs that are scheduled by
DCI formats and second PUSCHs configured by respective
*ConfiguredGrantConfig* or *semiPersistentOnPUSCH*, and the UE would
multiplex UCI in one of the candidate PUSCHs, and the candidate PUSCHs
fulfil the conditions in clause 9.2.5 for UCI multiplexing, the UE
multiplexes the UCI in a PUSCH from the first PUSCHs.

\- If the UE would multiplex UCI in one of the candidate PUSCHs and the
UE does not multiplex aperiodic CSI in any of the candidate PUSCHs, the
UE multiplexes the UCI in a PUSCH of the serving cell with the smallest
*ServCellIndex* subject to the conditions in clause 9.2.5 for UCI
multiplexing being fulfilled. If the UE transmits more than one PUSCHs
in the slot on the serving cell with the smallest *ServCellIndex* that
fulfil the conditions in clause 9.2.5 for UCI multiplexing, the UE
multiplexes the UCI in the earliest PUSCH that the UE transmits in the
slot.

If a UE transmits a PUSCH over multiple slots or multiple PUSCHs over
multiple slots that are scheduled by a DCI format 0\_1, and the UE would
transmit a PUCCH with HARQ-ACK and/or CSI information over a single slot
that overlaps with the PUSCH transmission in one or more slots of the
multiple slots, and the PUSCH transmission in the one or more slots
fulfills the conditions in clause 9.2.5 for multiplexing the HARQ-ACK
and/or CSI information, the UE multiplexes the HARQ-ACK and/or CSI
information in the PUSCH transmission in the one or more slots. The UE
does not multiplex HARQ-ACK and/or CSI information in the PUSCH
transmission in a slot from the multiple slots if the UE would not
transmit a single-slot PUCCH with HARQ-ACK and/or CSI information in the
slot in case the PUSCH transmission was absent.

If a UE transmits a PUSCH with repetition Type B and the UE would
transmit a PUCCH with HARQ-ACK and/or CSI information over a single slot
that overlaps with the PUSCH transmission in one or more slots, the UE
expects all actual repetitions of the PUSCH transmission \[6, TS
38.214\] that would overlap with the PUCCH transmission to fulfill the
conditions in clause 9.2.5 for multiplexing the HARQ-ACK and/or CSI
information, and the UE multiplexes the HARQ-ACK and/or CSI information
in the earliest actual PUSCH repetition of the PUSCH transmission that
would overlap with the PUCCH transmission and includes more than one
symbol. The UE does not expect that all actual repetitions that would
overlap with the PUCCH transmission do not include more than one symbol.

If the PUSCH transmission over the multiple slots is scheduled by a DCI
format that includes a DAI field, the value of the DAI field is
applicable for multiplexing HARQ-ACK information in the PUSCH
transmission in any slot from the multiple slots where the UE
multiplexes HARQ-ACK information.

When a UE would multiplex HARQ-ACK information in a PUSCH transmission
that is configured by a *ConfiguredGrantConfig,* and includes CG-UCI
\[5, TS 38.212\], the UE multiplexes the HARQ-ACK information in the
PUSCH transmission if the UE is provided *cg-UCI-Multiplexing*;
otherwise, the UE does not transmit the PUSCH and multiplexes the
HARQ-ACK information in a PUCCH transmission or in another PUSCH
transmission.

9.1 HARQ-ACK codebook determination
-----------------------------------

If a UE is provided *pdsch-HARQ-ACK-CodebookList,* the UE can be
indicated by *pdsch-HARQ-ACK-CodebookList* to generate one or two
HARQ-ACK codebooks. If the UE is indicated to generate one HARQ-ACK
codebook, the HARQ-ACK codebook is associated with a PUCCH of priority
index 0. If a UE is provided *pdsch-HARQ-ACK-CodebookList*, the UE
multiplexes in a same HARQ-ACK codebook only HARQ-ACK information
associated with a same priority index. If the UE is indicated to
generate two HARQ-ACK codebooks

> \- a first HARQ-ACK codebook is associated with a PUCCH of priority
> index 0 and a second HARQ-ACK codebook is associated with a PUCCH of
> priority index 1
>
> \- the UE is provided first and second for each of {*PUCCH-Config*,
> *UCI-OnPUSCH*, *PDSCH*-*codeBlockGroupTransmission*} by
> {*PUCCH-ConfigurationList*, *UCI-OnPUSCH-ListDCI-0-1*,
> *PDSCH-CodeBlockGroupTransmissionList*} or {*PUCCH-ConfigurationList*,
> *UCI-OnPUSCH-ListDCI-0-2*, *PDSCH-CodeBlockGroupTransmissionList*},
> respectively, for use with the first and second HARQ-ACK codebooks,
> respectively

If a UE receives a PDSCH without receiving a corresponding PDCCH, or if
the UE receives a PDCCH indicating a SPS PDSCH release, the UE generates
one corresponding HARQ-ACK information bit. If the UE generates two
HARQ-ACK codebooks, the UE is indicated by *harq-CodebookID*, per SPS
PDSCH configuration, a HARQ-ACK codebook index for multiplexing the
corresponding HARQ-ACK information bit.

If a UE is provided *pdsch-HARQ-ACK-OneShotFeedback and the UE detects
a* DCI format in any PDCCH monitoring occasion that includes a One-shot
HARQ-ACK request field with value 1

\- the UE includes the HARQ-ACK information in a Type-3 HARQ-ACK
codebook, as described in clause 9.1.4

\- the UE does not expect that the PDSCH-to-HARQ\_feedback timing
indicator field of the DCI format provides an inapplicable value from
*dl-DataToUL-ACK-r16*

In the remaining of this clause, reference is to one HARQ-ACK codebook
and to DCI formats that schedule PDSCH reception, or indicate SPS PDSCH
release, or indicate SCell dormancy without scheduling a PDSCH reception
and are associated with the HARQ-ACK codebook.

If a UE is required to receive SPS PDSCHs in a slot according to Clause
5.1 of \[6\] and Clause 11.1 for SPS configurations that are indicated
to be released by a DCI format, the UE is not expected to receive the
DCI format in the slot if the end of the last symbol of the PDCCH
reception is after the end of a last symbol of any of the SPS PDSCH
receptions. For a SPS configuration subject to *pdsch-AggregationFactor*
or *pdsch-AggregationFactor-r16*, the UE is not expected to receive the
DCI format in a slot containing a SPS PDSCH transmission occasion other
than the first transmission occasion required to be received by the UE
for a TB.

If a UE is configured to receive SPS PDSCHs in a slot for SPS
configurations that are indicated to be released by a DCI format, and if
the UE receives the PDCCH providing the DCI format in the slot, and if
HARQ-ACK information for the SPS PDSCH release and the SPS PDSCH
receptions would be multiplexed in a same PUCCH, the UE does not expect
to receive the SPS PDSCHs, does not generate HARQ-ACK information for
the SPS PDSCH receptions, and generates a HARQ-ACK information bit for
the SPS PDSCH release.

If a UE is configured to receive SPS PDSCH(s) in a slot for SPS
configuration(s), the UE does not expect to receive a PDCCH providing a
DCI format in the slot to indicate SPS PDSCH release of these SPS
configuration(s), if HARQ-ACK information for the SPS PDSCH release and
the SPS PDSCH reception(s) would map to different PUCCHs.

If a UE detects a DCI format 1\_1 indicating

\- SCell dormancy without scheduling a PDSCH reception, as described in
clause 10.3, and

\- is provided *pdsch-HARQ-ACK-Codebook = dynamic* *or
pdsch-HARQ-ACK-Codebook-r16*

the UE generates a HARQ-ACK information bit as described in clause 9.1.3
for a DCI format 1\_1 indicating SCell dormancy and the HARQ-ACK
information bit value is ACK.

If a UE is not provided *PDSCH-CodeBlockGroupTransmission*, the UE
generates one HARQ-ACK information bit per transport block.

For a HARQ-ACK information bit, a UE generates a positive
acknowledgement (ACK) if the UE detects a DCI format that provides a SPS
PDSCH release or correctly decodes a transport block, and generates a
negative acknowledgement (NACK) if the UE does not correctly decode the
transport block. A HARQ-ACK information bit value of 0 represents a NACK
while a HARQ-ACK information bit value of 1 represents an ACK.

In the following, the CRC for a DCI format is scrambled with a C-RNTI,
an MCS-C-RNTI, or a CS-RNTI.

### 9.1.1 CBG-based HARQ-ACK codebook determination

If a UE is provided *PDSCH-CodeBlockGroupTransmission* for a serving
cell, the UE receives a PDSCH scheduled by DCI format 1\_1, that
includes code block groups (CBGs) of a transport block. The UE is also
provided *maxCodeBlockGroupsPerTransportBlock* indicating a maximum
number ![](media/image400.wmf){width="0.6375in"
height="0.25277777777777777in"} of CBGs for generating respective
HARQ-ACK information bits for a transport block reception for the
serving cell.

For a number of ![](media/image401.wmf) code blocks (CBs) in a transport
block, the UE determines a number of CBGs ![](media/image402.wmf)
according to clause 5.1.7.1 of \[6, TS 38.214\] and determines a number
of HARQ-ACK bits for the transport block as ![](media/image403.wmf).

The UE generates an ACK for the HARQ-ACK information bit of a CBG if the
UE correctly received all code blocks of the CBG and generates a NACK
for the HARQ-ACK information bit of a CBG if the UE incorrectly received
at least one code block of the CBG. If the UE receives two transport
blocks, the UE concatenates the HARQ-ACK information bits for CBGs of
the second transport block after the HARQ-ACK information bits for CBGs
of the first transport block.

The HARQ-ACK codebook includes the ![](media/image404.wmf) HARQ-ACK
information bits and, if ![](media/image405.wmf) for a transport block,
the UE generates a NACK value for the last ![](media/image406.wmf)
HARQ-ACK information bits for the transport block in the HARQ-ACK
codebook.

If the UE generates a HARQ-ACK codebook in response to a retransmission
of a transport block, corresponding to a same HARQ process as a previous
transmission of the transport block, the UE generates an ACK for each
CBG that the UE correctly decoded in a previous transmission of the
transport block.

If a UE correctly detects each of the ![](media/image407.wmf) CBGs and
does not correctly detect the transport block for the
![](media/image407.wmf) CBGs, the UE generates a NACK value for each of
the ![](media/image407.wmf) CBGs.

### 9.1.2 Type-1 HARQ-ACK codebook determination

This clause applies if the UE is configured with
*pdsch-HARQ-ACK-Codebook = semi-static*.

A UE does not expect to be configured with *pdsch-HARQ-ACK-Codebook =
semi-static* for a codebook if a UE is provided *subslotLength-ForPUCCH
for the codebook*.

A UE reports HARQ-ACK information for a corresponding PDSCH reception or
SPS PDSCH release only in a HARQ-ACK codebook that the UE transmits in a
slot indicated by a value of a PDSCH-to-HARQ\_feedback timing indicator
field in a corresponding DCI format or provided by *dl-DataToUL-ACK* or
*dl-DataToUL-ACK-r16* or *dl-DataToUL-ACK-DCI-1-2* if the
PDSCH-to-HARQ\_feedback timing indicator field is not present in the DCI
format as described in clause 9.2.3. The UE reports NACK value(s) for
HARQ-ACK information bit(s) in a HARQ-ACK codebook that the UE transmits
in a slot not indicated by a value of a PDSCH-to-HARQ\_feedback timing
indicator field in a corresponding DCI format.

If a UE is not provided *pdsch-HARQ-ACK-OneShotFeedback*, the UE does
not expect to receive a PDSCH scheduled by a DCI format that the UE
detects in any PDCCH monitoring occasion and includes a
PDSCH-to-HARQ\_feedback timing indicator field providing an inapplicable
value from *dl-DataToUL-ACK-r16*.

If the UE is provided *pdsch-AggregationFactor-r16* in *SPS-Config* or
*pdsch-AggregationFactor* in *PDSCH-Config* and no entry in
*pdsch-TimeDomainAllocationList and
pdsch-TimeDomainAllocationListDCI-1-2 includes repetitionNumber* in
*PDSCH-TimeDomainResourceAllocation-r16*,
$N_{\text{PDSCH}}^{repeat,max}$ is a maximum value of
*pdsch-AggregationFactor-r16* in *SPS-Config* or
*pdsch-AggregationFactor* in *PDSCH-Config*; otherwise
$N_{\text{PDSCH}}^{repeat,max} = 1$. The UE reports HARQ-ACK information
for a PDSCH reception

\- from DL slot ${n_{D} - N}_{\text{PDSCH}}^{\text{repeat}} + 1$ to DL

#### 9.1.2.1 Type-1 HARQ-ACK codebook in physical uplink control channel

For a serving cell $c$, an active DL BWP, and an active UL BWP, as
described in clause 12, the UE determines a set of $M_{A,c}$ occasions
for candidate PDSCH receptions for which the UE can transmit
corresponding HARQ-ACK information in a PUCCH in slot $n_{U}$. If
serving cell $c$ is deactivated, the UE uses as the active DL BWP for
determining the set of $M_{A,c}$ occasions for candidate PDSCH
receptions a DL BWP provided by *firstActiveDownlinkBWP-Id*. The
determination is based:

a\) on a set of slot timing values $K_{1}$ associated with the active UL
BWP

a\) If the UE is configured to monitor PDCCH for DCI format 1\_0 and is
not configured to monitor PDCCH for either DCI format 1\_1 or DCI format
1\_2 on serving cell $c$, or the active DL BWP for serving cell $c$ is
dormant BWP, $K_{1}$ is provided by the slot timing values {1, 2, 3, 4,
5, 6, 7, 8}

b\) If the UE is configured to monitor PDCCH for DCI format 1\_1 and is
not configured to monitor PDCCH for DCI format 1\_2 for serving cell
$c$, $K_{1}$ is provided by *dl-DataToUL-ACK* or *dl-DataToUL-ACK-r16*

c\) If the UE is configured to monitor PDCCH for DCI format 1\_2 and is
not configured to monitor PDCCH for DCI format 1\_1 for serving cell
$c$, $K_{1}$ is provided by *dl-DataToUL-ACK-DCI-1-2*

d\) If the UE is configured to monitor PDCCH for DCI format 1\_1 and DCI
format 1\_2 for serving cell $c$, $K_{1}$ is provided by the union of
*dl-DataToUL-ACK or dl-DataToUL-ACK-r16* and *dl-DataToUL-ACK-DCI-1-2*

e\) If an inapplicable value in *dl-DataToUL-ACK-r16* is provided, the
value is excluded from $K_{1}$

b\) on a set of row indexes $R$ of a table that is associated with the
active DL BWP and defining respective sets of slot offsets $K_{0}$,
start and length indicators *SLIV*, and PDSCH mapping types for PDSCH
reception as described in \[6, TS 38.214\], where the row indexes $R$ of
the table are provided by the union of row indexes of time domain
resource allocation tables for DCI formats the UE is configured to
monitor PDCCH for serving cell $c$

a\) if the UE is provided *referenceOfSLIVDCI-1-2*, for each row index
with slot offset $K_{0} = 0$ and PDSCH mapping Type B in a set of row
indexes of a table for DCI format 1\_2 \[6, TS 38.214\], for any PDCCH
monitoring occasion in any slot where the UE monitors PDCCH for DCI
format 1\_2 and with starting symbol $S_{0} > 0$, if
${S + S}_{0} + L \leq 14$ for normal cyclic prefix and
${S + S}_{0} + L \leq 12$ for extended cyclic prefix, add a new row
index in the set of row indexes of the table by replacing the starting
symbol $S$ of the row index by ${S + S}_{0}$

c\) on the ratio $2^{\mu_{\text{D}\text{L}} - \mu_{\text{U}\text{L}}}$
between the downlink SCS configuration $\mu_{\text{D}\text{L}}$ and the
uplink SCS configuration $\mu_{\text{U}\text{L}}$ provided by
*subcarrierSpacing* in *BWP-Downlink* and *BWP-Uplink* for the active DL
BWP and the active UL BWP, respectively

d\) if provided, on *tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon* and
*tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated* as described in clause 11.1

e\) if *ca-SlotOffset is* provided, on
$N_{\text{slot,offset,}\text{c}}^{\text{DL}}\ $*and*
$\mu_{\text{offset}\text{,}\text{DL}\text{,c}}$ provided by
*ca-SlotOffset* for serving cell $c$, *or on*
$N_{\text{slot,offset}}^{\text{UL}}\ $ and
$\mu_{\text{offset}\text{,}\text{U}\text{L}}$ provided by
*ca-SlotOffset* for the primary cell, as described in \[4, TS 38.211\].

If a UE

\- is not provided *coresetPoolIndex* or is provided *coresetPoolIndex*
with a value of 0 for first CORESETs on active DL BWPs of serving cells,
and

\- is provided *coresetPoolIndex* with a value of 1 for second CORESETs
on active DL BWPs of the serving cells, and

\- is provided *ackNackFeedbackMode* = *joint*

where

\- a serving cell is placed in a first set $S_{\text{0}}$ of
$N_{\text{cells}}^{\text{DL,0}}$ serving cells if the serving cell
includes a first CORESET, and

\- a serving cell is placed in a second set $S_{\text{1}}$ of
$N_{\text{cells}}^{\text{DL,1}}$ serving cells if the serving cell
includes a second CORESET, and

\- serving cells are placed in a set according to an ascending order of
a serving cell index

the UE generates a Type-1 HARQ-ACK codebook for the set $S_{\text{0}}$
and the set $S_{1}$ of serving cells separately by setting
${N_{\text{cells}}^{\text{DL}} = N}_{\text{cells}}^{\text{DL,0}}$ and
${N_{\text{cells}}^{\text{DL}} = N}_{\text{cells}}^{\text{DL,1}}$ in the
following pseudo-code. The UE concatenates the HARQ-ACK codebook
generated for the set $S_{\text{0}}$ followed by the HARQ-ACK codebook
generated for the set $S_{1}$ to obtain a total number of
![](media/image409.wmf){width="0.3055555555555556in"
height="0.2013888888888889in"} HARQ-ACK information bits.

For the set of slot timing values ![](media/image410.wmf), the UE
determines a set of ![](media/image408.wmf) occasions for candidate
PDSCH receptions or SPS PDSCH releases according to the following
pseudo-code. A location in the Type-1 HARQ-ACK codebook for HARQ-ACK
information corresponding to a single SPS PDSCH release is same as for a
corresponding SPS PDSCH reception. A location in the Type-1 HARQ-ACK
codebook for HARQ-ACK information corresponding to multiple SPS PDSCH
releases by a single DCI format is same as for a corresponding SPS PDSCH
reception with the lowest SPS configuration index among the multiple SPS
PDSCH releases.

#### 9.1.2.2 Type-1 HARQ-ACK codebook in physical uplink shared channel

If a UE would multiplex HARQ-ACK information in a PUSCH transmission
that is not scheduled by a DCI format or is scheduled by a DCI format
that does not include a DAI field, then

*- if the* UE has not received any PDSCH or SPS PDSCH release that the
UE transmits corresponding HARQ-ACK information in the PUSCH, based on a
value of a respective PDSCH-to-HARQ\_feedback timing indicator field in
a DCI format scheduling the PDSCH reception or the SPS PDSCH release or
on the value of *dl-DataToUL-ACK* or *dl-DataToUL-ACK-r16* if the
PDSCH-to-HARQ\_feedback timing indicator field is not present in DCI
format 1\_1 or on the value of *dl-DataToUL-ACK-DCI-1-2* if the
PDSCH-to-HARQ\_feedback timing indicator field is not present in DCI
format 1\_2, in any of the $M_{c}$ occasions for candidate PDSCH
receptions by a DCI format or SPS PDSCH on any serving cell $c$, as
described in clause 9.1.2.1*,* the UE does not multiplex HARQ-ACK
information in the PUSCH transmission

\- else the UE generates the HARQ-ACK codebook as described in clause
9.1.2.1, except that *harq-ACK-SpatialBundlingPUCCH* is replaced by
*harq-ACK-SpatialBundlingPUSCH*, unless the UE receives only a SPS PDSCH
release, or only SPS PDSCH reception, or only a PDSCH that is scheduled
by DCI format 1\_0 with a counter DAI field value of 1 on the PCell in
the $M_{c}$ occasions for candidate PDSCH receptions in which case the
UE generates HARQ-ACK information only for the SPS PDSCH release or only
for the PDSCH reception as described in clause 9.1.2.

A UE sets to NACK value in the HARQ-ACK codebook any HARQ-ACK
information corresponding to PDSCH reception or SPS PDSCH release that
the UE detects in a PDCCH monitoring occasion that starts after a PDCCH
monitoring occasion where the UE detects a DCI format scheduling the
PUSCH transmission.

A UE does not expect to detect a DCI format switching a DL BWP within
$N_{2}$ symbols prior to a first symbol of a PUSCH transmission where
the UE multiplexes HARQ-ACK information, where $N_{2}$ is defined in
\[6, TS 38.214\].

If a UE multiplexes HARQ-ACK information in a PUSCH transmission that is
scheduled by DCI format that includes a DAI field, the UE generates the
HARQ-ACK codebook as described in clause 9.1.2.1 when a value of the DAI
field is $V_{\text{T-DAI}}^{\text{UL}} = 1$ except that
*harq-ACK-SpatialBundlingPUCCH* is replaced by
*harq-ACK-SpatialBundlingPUSCH*. The UE does not generate a HARQ-ACK
codebook for multiplexing in the PUSCH transmission when
$V_{\text{T-DAI}}^{\text{UL}} = 0$ unless the UE receives only a SPS
PDSCH release, or only SPS PDSCH(s), or only a PDSCH that is scheduled
by DCI format 1\_0 with a counter DAI field value of 1 on the PCell in
the $M_{c}$ occasions for candidate PDSCH receptions in which case the
UE generates HARQ-ACK information only for the SPS PDSCH release or only
for the PDSCH reception as described in clause 9.1.2.
$V_{\text{T-DAI}}^{\text{UL}} = 0$ if the PUSCH is scheduled by a DCI
format that includes a DAI field and the DAI field is set to \'0\';
otherwise, $V_{\text{T-DAI}}^{\text{UL}} = 1$.

### 9.1.3 Type-2 HARQ-ACK codebook determination 

This clause applies if the UE is configured with
*pdsch-HARQ-ACK-Codebook = dynamic* or with
*pdsch-HARQ-ACK-Codebook-r16*. Unless stated otherwise, a
PDSCH-to-HARQ\_feedback timing indicator field provides an applicable
value.

A UE does not expect to multiplex in a Type-2 HARQ-ACK codebook HARQ-ACK
information that is in response to a detection of a DCI format that does
not include a counter DAI field.

If a UE receives a first DCI format that the UE detects in a first PDCCH
monitoring occasion and includes a PDSCH-to-HARQ\_feedback timing
indicator field providing an inapplicable value from
*dl-DataToUL-ACK-r16*,

\- if the UE detects a second DCI format, the UE multiplexes the
corresponding HARQ-ACK information in a PUCCH or PUSCH transmission in a
slot that is indicated by a value of a PDSCH-to-HARQ\_feedback timing
indicator field in the second DCI format, where

\- if the UE is not provided *pdsch-HARQ-ACK-Codebook-r16*, the UE
detects the second DCI format in any PDCCH monitoring occasion after the
first one, and where the slot indicated by the value of the
PDSCH-to-HARQ\_feedback timing indicator field in the second DCI format
is no later than a slot for HARQ-ACK information in response to a SPS
PDSCH reception, if any, received after the PDSCH scheduled by the first
DCI format.

\- if the UE is provided *pdsch-HARQ-ACK-Codebook-r16*, the UE detects
the second DCI format in any PDCCH monitoring occasion after the first
one, and the second DCI format indicates a HARQ-ACK information report
for a same PDSCH group index as indicated by the first DCI format as
described in clause 9.1.3.3, and where the slot indicated by the value
of the PDSCH-to-HARQ\_feedback timing indicator field in the second DCI
format is no later than a slot for HARQ-ACK information in response to a
SPS PDSCH reception, if any, received after the PDSCH scheduled by the
first DCI format.

\- if the UE is provided *pdsch-HARQ-ACK-Codebook-r16*, the UE receives
the second DCI format later than the slot for HARQ-ACK information in
response to a SPS PDSCH reception received after the PDSCH scheduled by
the first DCI format, and the second DCI format indicates a HARQ-ACK
information report for a same PDSCH group index as indicated by the
first DCI format as described in clause 9.1.3.3.

\- if the UE is provided *pdsch-HARQ-ACK-OneShotFeedback, the first DCI
format does not indicate SPS PDSCH release or SCell dormancy, the UE
detects* the second DCI format in any PDCCH monitoring occasion after
the first one, and the second DCI format includes a One-shot HARQ-ACK
request field with value 1, the UE includes the HARQ-ACK information in
a Type-3 HARQ-ACK codebook, as described in clause 9.1.4, and where the
slot indicated by the value of the PDSCH-to-HARQ\_feedback timing
indicator field in the second DCI format is no later than a slot for
HARQ-ACK information in response to a SPS PDSCH reception, if any,
received after the PDSCH scheduled by the first DCI format.

\- if the UE is provided *pdsch-HARQ-ACK-OneShotFeedback-r16*, the first
DCI format does not indicate SPS PDSCH release or SCell dormancy, and
the UE receives the second DCI format later than the slot for HARQ-ACK
information in response to a SPS PDSCH reception received after the
PDSCH scheduled by the first DCI format, and the second DCI format
includes a One-shot HARQ-ACK request field with value 1, the UE includes
the HARQ-ACK information in a Type-3 HARQ-ACK codebook, as described in
clause 9.1.4.

\- otherwise, the UE does not multiplex the corresponding HARQ-ACK
information in a PUCCH or PUSCH transmission.

#### 9.1.3.1 Type-2 HARQ-ACK codebook in physical uplink control channel

A UE determines monitoring occasions for PDCCH with DCI format
scheduling PDSCH receptions or SPS PDSCH release or indicating SCell
dormancy on an active DL BWP of a serving cell $c$, as described in
clause 10.1, and for which the UE transmits HARQ-ACK information in a
same PUCCH in slot $n$ based on

\- PDSCH-to-HARQ\_feedback timing indicator field values or a
*dl-DataToUL-ACK*, or *dl-DataToUL-ACK-r16*, or
*dl-DataToUL-ACK-DCI-1-2* value if the PDSCH-to-HARQ\_feedback timing
indicator field is not present in a DCI format, for PUCCH transmission
with HARQ-ACK information in slot $n$ in response to PDSCH receptions,
SPS PDSCH release or SCell dormancy indication

\- slot offsets $K_{0}$ \[6, TS 38.214\] provided by time domain
resource assignment field in a DCI format scheduling PDSCH receptions
and by *pdsch-AggregationFactor, or pdsch-AggregationFactor-r16, or*
*repetitionNumber*, when provided.

The set of PDCCH monitoring occasions for a DCI format scheduling PDSCH
receptions or SPS PDSCH release or indicating SCell dormancy is defined
as the union of PDCCH monitoring occasions across active DL BWPs of
configured serving cells. PDCCH monitoring occasions are indexed in an
ascending order of their start times. The cardinality of the set of
PDCCH monitoring occasions defines a total number $M$ of PDCCH
monitoring occasions.

A value of the counter downlink assignment indicator (DAI) field in DCI
formats denotes the accumulative number of {serving cell, PDCCH
monitoring occasion}-pair(s) in which PDSCH reception(s), SPS PDSCH
release or SCell dormancy indication associated with the DCI formats,
excluding the SPS activation DCI, is present up to the current serving
cell and current PDCCH monitoring occasion,

\- first, if the UE indicates by *type2-HARQ-ACK-Codebook* support for
more than one PDSCH reception on a serving cell that are scheduled from
a same PDCCH monitoring occasion, in increasing order of the PDSCH
reception starting time for the same {serving cell, PDCCH monitoring
occasion} pair,

\- second in ascending order of serving cell index, and

\- third in ascending order of PDCCH monitoring occasion index $m$,
where $0 \leq m < M$.

If, for an active DL BWP of a serving cell, the UE is not provided
*coresetPoolIndex* or is provided *coresetPoolIndex* with value 0 for
one or more first CORESETs and is provided *coresetPoolIndex* with value
1 for one or more second CORESETs, and is provided *ackNackFeedbackMode*
= *joint*, the value of the counter DAI is in the order of the first
CORESETs and then the second CORESETs for a same serving cell index and
a same PDCCH monitoring occasion index.

The value of the total DAI, when present \[5, TS 38.212\], in a DCI
format denotes the total number of {serving cell, PDCCH monitoring
occasion}-pair(s) in which PDSCH reception(s), SPS PDSCH release or
SCell dormancy indication associated with DCI formats, excluding the SPS
activation DCI, is present up to the current PDCCH monitoring occasion
$m$ and is updated from PDCCH monitoring occasion to PDCCH monitoring
occasion. If, for an active DL BWP of a serving cell, the UE is not
provided *coresetPoolIndex* or is provided *coresetPoolIndex* with value
0 for one or more first CORESETs and is provided *coresetPoolIndex* with
value 1 for one or more second CORESETs, and is provided
*ackNackFeedbackMode* = *joint*, the total DAI value counts the {serving
cell, PDCCH monitoring occasion}-pair(s) for both the first CORESETs and
the second CORESETs.

Denote by $N_{C - \text{DAI}}^{\text{DL}}$ the number of bits for the
counter DAI and set $T_{D} = 2^{N_{C - \text{DAI}}^{\text{DL}}}$. Denote
by $V_{C - \text{DAI,}\text{c,m}}^{\text{DL}}$ the value of the counter
DAI in a DCI format scheduling PDSCH reception, SPS PDSCH release or
SCell dormancy indication on serving cell $c$ in PDCCH monitoring
occasion $m$ according to Table 9.1.3-1 or Table 9.1.3-1A. Denote by
$V_{T - \text{DAI,}\text{m}}^{\text{DL}}$ the value of the total DAI in
a DCI format in PDCCH monitoring occasion $m$ according to Table
9.1.3-1. The UE assumes a same value of total DAI in all DCI formats
that include a total DAI field in PDCCH monitoring occasion $m$. A UE
does not expect to multiplex, in a same Type-2 HARQ-ACK codebook,
HARQ-ACK information that is in response to detection of DCI formats
with different number of bits for the counter DAI field.

If the UE transmits HARQ-ACK information in a PUCCH in slot $n$ and for
any PUCCH format, the UE determines the
${\widetilde{o}}_{0}^{\text{ACK}},\ {\widetilde{o}}_{1}^{\text{ACK}},\cdots,{\widetilde{o}}_{O_{\text{ACK}} - 1}^{\text{ACK}}$
, for a total number of $O_{\text{ACK}}$ HARQ-ACK information bits,
according to the following pseudo-code:

Set $m = 0$ -- PDCCH with DCI format scheduling PDSCH reception, SPS
PDSCH release or SCell dormancy indication monitoring occasion index:
lower index corresponds to earlier PDCCH monitoring occasion

Set $j = 0$

Set $V_{\text{temp}} = 0$

Set $V_{temp2} = 0$

Set $V_{s} = \varnothing$

Set $N_{\text{cells}}^{\text{DL}}$ to the number of serving cells
configured by higher layers for the UE

*coresetPoolIndex* or is provided *coresetPoolIndex* with value 0 for
one or more first CORESETs and is provided *coresetPoolIndex* with value
1 for one or more second CORESETs, and is provided *ackNackFeedbackMode
= joint, the serving cell is counted two times where the first time
corresponds to the first CORESETs and the second time corresponds to the
second CORESETs*

\- if the UE indicates *type2-HARQ-ACK-Codebook*, a serving cell is
counted $N_{\text{PDSCH}}^{\text{MO}}$ times where
$N_{\text{PDSCH}}^{\text{MO}}$ is the number of PDSCH receptions that
can be scheduled for the serving cell by DCI formats in PDCCH receptions
at a same PDCCH monitoring occasion based on the reported value of
*type2-HARQ-ACK-Codebook*

If a UE is configured to receive SPS PDSCH and the UE multiplexes
HARQ-ACK information for one activated SPS PDSCH reception, including
the ones associated with the corresponding activation DCI, in the PUCCH
in slot $n$, the UE generates one HARQ-ACK information bit associated
with the SPS PDSCH reception and appends it to the $O^{\text{ACK}}$
HARQ-ACK information bits.

If a UE is configured to receive SPS PDSCH and the UE multiplexes
HARQ-ACK information for multiple activated SPS PDSCH receptions,
including the ones associated with the corresponding activation DCI, in
the PUCCH in slot $n$, the UE generates the HARQ-ACK information as
described in clause 9.1.2 and appends it to the $O^{\text{ACK}}$
HARQ-ACK information bits.

For a PDCCH monitoring occasion with DCI format scheduling PDSCH
reception or SPS PDSCH release or indicating SCell dormancy in the
active DL BWP of a serving cell, when a UE receives a PDSCH with one
transport block or a SPS PDSCH release or indicating SCell dormancy and
the value of *maxNrofCodeWordsScheduledByDCI* is 2, the HARQ-ACK
information is associated with the first transport block and the UE
generates a NACK for the second transport block if
*harq-ACK-SpatialBundlingPUCCH* is not provided and generates HARQ-ACK
information with value of ACK for the second transport block if
*harq-ACK-SpatialBundlingPUCCH* is provided.

If a UE is not provided *PDSCH-CodeBlockGroupTransmission* for each of
the $N_{\text{cells}}^{\text{DL}}$ serving cells, or for PDSCH
receptions scheduled by a DCI format that does not support CBG-based
PDSCH receptions, or for SPS PDSCH reception, or for SPS PDSCH release,
or for SCell dormancy indication, and if
$O_{\text{ACK}} + O_{\text{SR}} + O_{\text{CSI}} \leq 11$, the UE
determines a number of HARQ-ACK information bits $n_{\text{HARQ-ACK}}$
for obtaining a transmission power for a PUCCH, as described in clause
7.2.1, as

$n_{\text{HARQ-ACK}} = n_{\text{HARQ-ACK,TB}} = \left( \left( V_{\text{DAI},m_{\text{last}}}^{\text{DL}} - \sum_{c = 0}^{N_{\text{cells}}^{\text{DL}} - 1}U_{\text{DAI,}c} \right)\text{mod}\left( T_{D} \right) \right)N_{\text{TB,}\max}^{\text{DL}} + \sum_{c = 0}^{N_{\text{cells}}^{\text{DL}} - 1}\left( \sum_{m = 0}^{M - 1}{N_{m,c}^{\text{received}} + N_{\text{SPS},c}} \right)$

where

\- if $N_{\text{cells}}^{\text{DL}} = 1$,
$V_{DAI,m_{\text{last}}}^{\text{DL}}$ is the value of the counter DAI in
the last DCI format scheduling PDSCH reception or indicating SPS PDSCH
release or indicating SCell dormancy, for any serving cell $c$ that the
UE detects within the $M$ PDCCH monitoring occasions.

field in a last PDCCH monitoring occasion within the $M$ PDCCH
monitoring occasions where the UE detects at least one DCI format
scheduling PDSCH reception, indicating SPS PDSCH release or indicating
SCell dormancy for any serving cell $c$,
$V_{DAI,m_{\text{last}}}^{\text{DL}}$ is the value of the total DAI in
the at least one DCI format that includes a total DAI field

\- $V_{DAI,m_{\text{last}}}^{\text{DL}} = 0$ if the UE does not detect
any DCI format scheduling PDSCH reception, indicating SPS PDSCH release
or indicating SCell dormancy for any serving cell $c$ in any of the $M$
PDCCH monitoring occasions.

\- $U_{\text{DAI,}\text{c}}$ is the total number of a DCI format
scheduling PDSCH reception, indicating SPS PDSCH release or indicating
SCell dormancy that the UE detects within the $M$ PDCCH monitoring
occasions for serving cell $c$. $U_{\text{DAI,}\text{c}} = 0$ if the UE

*maxNrofCodeWordsScheduledByDCI* is 2 for any serving cell $c$ and
*harq-ACK-SpatialBundlingPUCCH* is not provided; otherwise,
$N_{TB,max}^{\text{DL}} = 1$.

\- $N_{m,c}^{\text{received}}$ is the number of transport blocks the UE
receives in a PDSCH scheduled by a DCI format that the UE detects in
PDCCH monitoring occasion $m$ for serving cell $c$ if
*harq-ACK-SpatialBundlingPUCCH* is not provided, or the number of PDSCH
scheduled by a DCI format that the UE detects in PDCCH monitoring
occasion $m$ for serving cell $c$ if *harq-ACK-SpatialBundlingPUCCH* is
provided, or the number of DCI format that the UE detects and indicate
SPS PDSCH release in PDCCH monitoring occasion $m$ for serving cell $c$,
or the number of DCI format that the UE detects and indicate SCell
dormancy in PDCCH monitoring occasion $m$ for serving cell $c$.

\- $N_{\text{SPS,}\text{c}}$ is the number of SPS PDSCH receptions by
the UE on serving cell $c$ for which the UE transmits corresponding
HARQ-ACK information in the same PUCCH as for HARQ-ACK information
corresponding to PDSCH receptions within the $M$ PDCCH monitoring
occasions.

If a UE

\- is provided *PDSCH-CodeBlockGroupTransmission* for
$N_{\text{cells}}^{\text{DL,CBG}}$ serving cells; and

\- is not provided *PDSCH-CodeBlockGroupTransmission*, for
$N_{\text{cells}}^{\text{DL,TB}}$ serving cells where
$N_{\text{cells}}^{\text{DL,TB}} + N_{\text{cells}}^{\text{DL,CBG}} = N_{\text{cells}}^{\text{DL}}$

the UE determines the
${\widetilde{o}}_{0}^{\text{ACK}},\ {\widetilde{o}}_{1}^{\text{ACK}},\cdots,{\widetilde{o}}_{O_{\text{ACK}} - 1}^{\text{ACK}}$
according to the previous pseudo-code with the following modifications

\- $N_{\text{cells}}^{\text{DL}}$ is used for the determination of a
first HARQ-ACK sub-codebook for

\- SPS PDSCH release,

\- SPS PDSCH reception,

\- DCI format 1\_1 indicating SCell dormancy, and

\- for TB-based PDSCH receptions on the
$N_{\text{cells}}^{\text{DL,CBG}}$ serving cells and on the
$N_{\text{cells}}^{\text{DL,TB}}$ serving cells,

\- $N_{\text{cells}}^{\text{DL}}$ is replaced by
$N_{\text{cells}}^{\text{DL,CBG}}$ for the determination of a second
HARQ-ACK sub-codebook corresponding to the
$N_{\text{cells}}^{\text{DL,CBG}}$ serving cells for CBG-based PDSCH
receptions, and

\- if, for an active DL BWP of a serving cell, the UE is not provided
*coresetPoolIndex* or is provided *coresetPoolIndex* with value 0 for
one or more first CORESETs and is provided *coresetPoolIndex* with value
1 for one or more second CORESETs, and is provided *ackNackFeedbackMode*
= *joint, the serving cell is counted as two times where the first time
corresponds to the first CORESETs and the second time corresponds to the
second CORESETs*, and

\- instead of generating one HARQ-ACK information bit per transport
block for a serving cell from the $N_{\text{cells}}^{\text{DL,CBG}}$
serving cells, the UE generates
$N_{\text{HARQ} - \text{ACK,max}}^{\text{CBG/TB,max}}$ HARQ-ACK
information bits, where
![](media/image520.wmf){width="0.8298611111111112in"

#### 9.1.3.2 Type-2 HARQ-ACK codebook in physical uplink shared channel

If a UE would multiplex HARQ-ACK information in a PUSCH transmission
that is not scheduled by a DCI format or is scheduled by a DCI format
that does not include a DAI field, then

*- if the* UE has not received any PDCCH within the monitoring occasions
for DCI formats scheduling PDSCH receptions, or SPS PDSCH release, or
DCI format 1\_1 indicating SCell dormancy on any serving cell $c$ and
the UE does not have HARQ-ACK information in response to a SPS PDSCH
reception to multiplex in the PUSCH, as described in clause 9.1.3.1*,*
the UE does not multiplex HARQ-ACK information in the PUSCH
transmission;

\- else, the UE generates the HARQ-ACK codebook as described in clause
9.1.3.1, except that *harq-ACK-SpatialBundlingPUCCH* is replaced by
*harq-ACK-SpatialBundlingPUSCH*.

If a UE multiplexes HARQ-ACK information in a PUSCH transmission that is
scheduled by a DCI format that includes a DAI field, the UE generates
the HARQ-ACK codebook as described in clause 9.1.3.1, with the following
modifications:

\- For the pseudo-code for the HARQ-ACK codebook generation in clause
9.1.3.1, after the completion of the $c$ and $m$ loops, the UE sets
${V_{temp2} = V}_{T - \text{DAI}}^{\text{UL}}$ where
$V_{T - \text{DAI}}^{\text{UL}}$ is the value of the DAI field according
to Table 9.1.3-2

\- For the case of first and second HARQ-ACK sub-codebooks, the DCI
format includes a first DAI field corresponding to the first HARQ-ACK
sub-codebook and a second DAI field corresponding to the second HARQ-ACK
sub-codebook

*- harq-ACK-SpatialBundlingPUCCH* is replaced by
*harq-ACK-SpatialBundlingPUSCH*.

If a UE is not provided *PDSCH-CodeBlockGroupTransmission* and the UE is
scheduled for a PUSCH transmission by DCI format that includes a DAI
field with value $V_{\text{T-DAI}}^{\text{UL}} = 4$ and the UE has not
received any PDCCH within the monitoring occasions for PDCCH with DCI
format scheduling PDSCH receptions or SPS PDSCH release or indicating
SCell dormancy on any serving cell $c$ and the UE does not have HARQ-ACK
information in response to a SPS PDSCH reception to multiplex in the
PUSCH, as described in clause 9.1.3.1, the UE does not multiplex
HARQ-ACK information in the PUSCH transmission.

If a UE is provided *PDSCH-CodeBlockGroupTransmission* and the UE is
scheduled for a PUSCH transmission by DCI format that includes a DAI
field with first value $V_{\text{T-DAI}}^{\text{UL}} = 4$ or with second
value $V_{\text{T-DAI}}^{\text{UL}} = 4$ and the UE has not received any
PDCCH within the monitoring occasions for PDCCH with DCI format
scheduling PDSCH receptions or SPS PDSCH release, or DCI format 1\_1
indicating SCell dormancy, on any serving cell $c$ and the UE does not
have HARQ-ACK information in response to a SPS PDSCH reception to
multiplex in the PUSCH, as described in clause 9.1.3.1, the UE does not
multiplex HARQ-ACK information for the first sub-codebook or for the
second sub-codebook, respectively, in the PUSCH transmission.

#### 9.1.3.3 Type-2 HARQ-ACK codebook grouping and HARQ-ACK retransmission

If a UE is provided *pdsch-HARQ-ACK-Codebook-r16,* the UE determines
HARQ-ACK information for multiplexing in a PUCCH transmission occasion
according to the following procedure.

Set $g$ to the value of a PDSCH group index field in a last DCI format
that provides a value of $g$ and indicates a PUCCH transmission
occasion.

Set $i(g)$ to denote a PUCCH transmission occasion for multiplexing
HARQ-ACK information

Set $k$ to the value of a PDSCH-to-HARQ\_feedback timing field, if any,
in a DCI format providing a value of $g$

\- If the DCI format does not include a PDSCH-to-HARQ\_feedback timing
field, set $k$ to the value provided by *dl-DataToUL-ACK* or
*dl-DataToUL-ACK-r16*

Set $h(g)$ to the value of a first **New feedback indicator** field in
the last DCI format providing the value of $g$

Set $h^{\left( g + 1 \right)mod2}(g)$ to a value of a second **New
feedback indicator** field in the last DCI format providing the value of
$g$

Set $V_{\text{DAI}}^{\left( g + 1 \right)mod2}$ to the value of a total
DAI field for group $\left( g + 1 \right)mod2$ in the last DCI format
providing the value of $g$

\- If $g = 1$ and the UE detects a DCI format that does not include a
PDSCH group index field in a PDCCH reception that is after the PDCCH
reception for the last DCI format detection providing the value of $g$
and indicating a same slot for a PUCCH transmission occasion, set
$V_{\text{DAI}}^{\left( g + 1 \right)mod2} = \varnothing$

Set $q$ to the value of a number of requested PDSCH group(s) field in
the last DCI format providing the value of *g*

A UE does not expect to detect DCI formats with respective

\- Number of requested PDSCH group(s) field values of 0, and

\- PDSCH-to-HARQ\_feedback timing field values that indicate a same
PUCCH transmission occasion, and

\- PDSCH group index field values that are different

Generate first HARQ-ACK information for PUCCH transmission occasion
$i(g)$ in a slot, as described in clause 9.1.3.1, where

\- the first HARQ-ACK information corresponds only to detections of DCI
formats each providing a same value of $g$, of $h(g)$, and to detections
of DCI formats that do not provide a value of $g$ and $h(g)$ and are
associated with a same value of $g$, of $h(g)$, and at least one of the
DCI formats providing a value of $k$ indicating the slot

\- at least one of the DCI formats provides a $h(g)$ value

\- $m = 0$ corresponds to a PDCCH monitoring occasion, where the UE
detects a DCI format that provides a value of $g$ or is associated with
a value of $g$, that is the first PDCCH monitoring occasion after a
PDCCH monitoring occasion where the UE detects another DCI format that
provides a value different than $h(g)$

The generation of the first HARQ-ACK information for PUCCH transmission
occasion $i\left( g \right)$ in a slot, as described in clause 9.1.3.1,
excludes the generation of HARQ-ACK information for SPS PDSCH
receptions.

If $h^{\left( g + 1 \right)mod2}\left( g \right) = \varnothing$ or
$h^{\left( g + 1 \right)mod2}\left( g \right) = h(\left( g + 1 \right)mod2)$,
generate second HARQ-ACK information for PUCCH transmission occasion
$i(\left( g + 1 \right)mod2)$ in a slot, as described in clause 9.1.3.1,
where

\- the second HARQ-ACK information corresponds to detections of DCI
formats each providing a same value of $\left( g + 1 \right)mod2$, of
$h(\left( g + 1 \right)mod2)$ and to detections of DCI formats that do
not provide a value of $\left( g + 1 \right)mod2$, of
$h(\left( g + 1 \right)mod2)$, but are associated with a same value of
$\left( g + 1 \right)mod2$, of $h(\left( g + 1 \right)mod2)$

\- at least one of the DCI formats provides a
$h(\left( g + 1 \right)mod2)$ value

\- $m = 0$ corresponds to a PDCCH monitoring occasion, where the UE
detects a DCI format that provides a value of $\left( g + 1 \right)mod2$
or that is associated with a value of $\left( g + 1 \right)mod2$, that
is the first PDCCH monitoring occasion after a PDCCH monitoring occasion
where the UE detects another DCI format that provides a value different
than $h(\left( g + 1 \right)mod2)$

\- the PUCCH transmission occasion $i(\left( g + 1 \right)mod2)$ is a
last one for multiplexing second HARQ-ACK information and it is not
after PUCCH transmission occasion $i(g)$

\- if $V_{\text{DAI}}^{\left( g + 1 \right)mod2} \neq \varnothing$,
after the completion of the $c$ and $m$ loops for the pseudo-code for
the second HARQ-ACK codebook generation in clause 9.1.3.1, set
$V_{temp2} = V_{\text{DAI}}^{\left( g + 1 \right)mod2}$. If the UE is
provided *PDSCH-CodeBlockGroupTransmission* for
$N_{\text{cells}}^{DL,CBG}$ serving cells, set
$V_{temp2} = V_{\text{DAI}}^{\left( g + 1 \right)mod2}$ for both
sub-codebooks before appending the second sub-codebook to the first
sub-codebook.

If $h^{\left( g + 1 \right)mod2}\left( g \right) \neq \varnothing$ and
$h^{\left( g + 1 \right)mod2}\left( g \right) \neq h(\left( g + 1 \right)mod2)$,
generate second HARQ-ACK information as described in clause 9.1.3.1 by
setting $M = 0$ and, after the completion of the $c$ and $m$ loops for
the pseudo-code for the second HARQ-ACK codebook generation in clause
9.1.3.1, setting
$V_{temp2} = V_{\text{DAI}}^{\left( g + 1 \right)mod2}$.

The generation of the second HARQ-ACK information for PUCCH transmission
occasion $i(\left( g + 1 \right)mod2)$ in a slot, as described in clause
9.1.3.1, excludes the generation of HARQ-ACK information for SPS PDSCH
receptions.

If $q = 0$, the UE

includes only the first HARQ-ACK information for multiplexing in PUCCH
transmission occasion $i(g)$

elseif $q = 1$

if g = 1

> appends the first HARQ-ACK information to the second HARQ-ACK
> information for multiplexing in PUCCH transmission occasion $i(g)$

else

> append the second HARQ-ACK information to the first HARQ-ACK
> information for multiplexing in PUCCH transmission occasion $i(g)$

end if

end if

The UE appends the HARQ-ACK information corresponding to SPS PDSCH
receptions, if any, as described in clause 9.1.3.1, after the first and
second, if any, HARQ-ACK information.

If the HARQ-ACK information is multiplexed in a PUSCH transmission, the
HARQ-ACK information is determined as

\- for multiplexing in PUCCH transmission occasion $i(g)$, if the PUSCH
transmission is not scheduled by a DCI format or is scheduled by a DCI
format that does not include a DCI field with value
$V_{\text{DAI}}^{\text{UL}}$

\- for multiplexing in PUCCH transmission occasion $i(g)$, if the PUSCH
transmission is scheduled by a DCI format without *ul-TotalDAI-Included*
configured except that for PDSCH group $g$, the DCI field with value
$V_{\text{DAI}}^{\text{UL}}$ in the DCI format is used after the
completion of the $c$ and $m$ loops for the pseudo-code for the HARQ-ACK
codebook generation in clause 9.1.3.1, and when the HARQ-ACK information
multiplexed in the PUCCH transmission occasion $i\left( g \right)$ does
not include HARQ-ACK information for PDSCH group
$\left( g + 1 \right)mod2$

\- for multiplexing in PUCCH transmission occasion $i(g)$, if the PUSCH
transmission is scheduled by a DCI format without *ul-TotalDAI-Included*
configured except that for PDSCH group $g = 0$, the DCI field with value
$V_{\text{DAI}}^{\text{UL}}$ in the DCI format is used after the
completion of the $c$ and $m$ loops for the pseudo-code for the HARQ-ACK
codebook generation in clause 9.1.3.1, and when the HARQ-ACK information
multiplexed in the PUCCH transmission occasion $i\left( g \right)$
includes HARQ-ACK information for PDSCH groups $g$ and
$\left( g + 1 \right)mod2$

\- for multiplexing in PUCCH transmission occasion $i(g)$, if the PUSCH
transmission is scheduled by a DCI format without *ul-TotalDAI-Included*
configured except that for PDSCH group $g = 0$, the DCI field with value
in the DCI format is used after the completion of the $c$ and $m$ loops
for the pseudo-code for the HARQ-ACK codebook generation in clause
9.1.3.1, and when the UE has not detected any DCI format scheduling
PDSCH receptions, and the UE has not detected any DCI format with a
request for HARQ-ACK information for any PDSCH group

\- for multiplexing in PUCCH transmission occasion $i(g)$, if the PUSCH
transmission is scheduled by a DCI format with *ul-TotalDAI-Included*
configured except that MSBs of the DCI field with value
$V_{\text{DAI}}^{\text{UL}}$ in the DCI format are used for PDSCH group
$g = 0$, and LSBs of DCI field with value $V_{\text{DAI}}^{\text{UL}}$
in the DCI format are used for PDSCH group $g = 1$, after the completion
of the $c$ and $m$ loops for the pseudo-code for the HARQ-ACK codebook
generation in clause 9.1.3.1.

If a UE is scheduled a PUSCH transmission by DCI format 0\_1 having a
DAI field value $V_{\text{DAI}}^{\text{UL}} = 4$ for a PDSCH group
index, and the UE has not detected any DCI format scheduling PDSCH
receptions for the PDSCH group index, and the UE has not detected any
DCI format with a request for HARQ-ACK information for the PDSCH group
index, the UE does not multiplex HARQ-ACK information in the PUSCH
transmission for the PDSCH group index.

If a UE detects DCI formats with respective PDSCH-to-HARQ\_feedback
timing field values indicating a same PUCCH transmission occasion and
none of the DCI formats that the UE detects after a last PUCCH
transmission occasion for $g = 0$ includes a **New feedback indicator**
field for $g = 0$, and at least one of the DCI formats is DCI format
1\_0, the UE generates HARQ-ACK information only for PDSCH receptions
scheduled by detections of DCI format 1\_0 and SPS PDSCH releases
indicated by detections of DCI format 1\_0, as described in clause
9.1.3.1 or 9.1.3.2 for multiplexing in the PUCCH transmission occasion.

If a DCI format indicating a slot for a PUCCH transmission occasion does
not include a New feedback indicator field, a PDSCH reception scheduled
by the DCI format or a SPS PDSCH release indicated by the DCI format is
associated with PDSCH group 0 and a value of *h*(*g*) associated with
the DCI format is set only if *h*(*g*) is provided by another DCI format
that provides a value of *h*(*g*) for PDSCH group 0 and indicates the
slot for the PUCCH transmission occasion.

For PUCCH transmission occasion $i(g)$, the UE determines a PUCCH or a
PUSCH transmission to multiplex the HARQ-ACK information according to
the procedures in clauses 9.2.3 and 9.2.5.

If $O_{\text{ACK}} + O_{\text{SR}} + O_{\text{CSI}} \leq 11$, the UE
determines a number of HARQ-ACK information bits $n_{HARQ - ACK,g}\ $for
group $g\ $and a number of HARQ-ACK information bits
$n_{HARQ - ACK,(g + 1)mod2}$ for group $\left( g + 1 \right)mod2$ as
described in clause 9.1.3.1 where $N_{\text{SPS},c}$ is included in
$n_{HARQ - ACK,g}$ and, if $q = 1$ and
$V_{\text{DAI}}^{\left( g + 1 \right)mod2} \neq \varnothing$, the UE
determines $n_{HARQ - ACK,(g + 1)mod2}$ by setting
${V_{DAI,m_{\text{last}}}^{\text{DL}} = V}_{\text{DAI}}^{\left( g + 1 \right)mod2}$.
For obtaining a PUCCH transmission power, if $q = 0$,
$n_{HARQ - ACK}\  = \ n_{HARQ - ACK,\ \ g}$; else,
$n_{HARQ - ACK}\  = \ n_{HARQ - ACK,g} + n_{HARQ - ACK,\ \ (g + 1)mod2}$.

### 9.1.4 Type-3 HARQ-ACK codebook determination 

If a UE is provided *pdsch-HARQ-ACK-OneShotFeedback,* the UE determines
${\widetilde{o}}_{0}^{\text{ACK}},{\widetilde{o}}_{1}^{\text{ACK}},\ldots,{\widetilde{o}}_{O_{\text{ACK}} - 1}^{\text{ACK}}$
HARQ-ACK information bits, for a total number of $O_{\text{ACK}}$
HARQ-ACK information bits, of a Type-3 HARQ-ACK codebook according to
the following procedure.

Set $N_{\text{cells}}^{\text{DL}}$ to the number of configured serving
cells

Set $N_{HARQ,c}^{\text{DL}}$ to the value of
*nrofHARQ-ProcessesForPDSCH* for serving cell $c$, if provided; else,
set $N_{HARQ,c}^{\text{DL}} = 8$

*maxNrofCodeWordsScheduledByDCI* for serving cell $c$ if

not provided, or if *maxCodeBlockGroupsPerTransportBlock* is provided
for serving cell $c$; else, set $N_{TB,c}^{\text{DL}} = 1$

Set $N_{HARQ - ACK,c}^{CBG/TB,max}$ to the number of HARQ-ACK
information bits per TB for PDSCH receptions on serving cell $c$ as
described in clause 9.1.1 if *maxCodeBlockGroupsPerTransportBlock* is
provided for serving cell $c$ and *pdsch-HARQ-ACK-OneShotFeedbackCBG* is
provided; else, set $N_{HARQ - ACK,c}^{CBG/TB,max} = 0$

Set $\text{NDI}_{\text{HARQ}} = 0$ if
*pdsch-HARQ-ACK-OneShotFeedbackNDI* is provided; else set
$\text{NDI}_{\text{HARQ}} = 1$

Set $c = 0$ -- serving cell index

end while

If $N_{TB,c}^{\text{DL}} > 1$, when a UE receives a PDSCH with one
transport block, the HARQ-ACK information is associated with the first
transport block.

If a UE receives a SPS PDSCH, or a PDSCH that is scheduled by a DCI
format that does not support CBG-based PDSCH receptions for a serving
cell $c$ and if *maxCodeBlockGroupsPerTransportBlock* is provided for
serving cell $c$, and *pdsch-HARQ-ACK-OneShotFeedbackCBG* is provided,
the UE repeats $N_{HARQ - ACK,c}^{CBG/TB,max}$ times the HARQ-ACK
information for the transport block in the PDSCH.

If a UE detects a DCI format that includes a One-shot HARQ-ACK request
field with value 1, the UE determines a PUCCH or a PUSCH to multiplex a
Type-3 HARQ-ACK codebook for transmission in a slot as described in
clauses 9.2.3 and 9.2.5. The UE multiplexes only the Type-3 HARQ-ACK
codebook in the PUCCH or the PUSCH for transmission in the slot.

If

\- a UE detects a DCI format that includes a One-shot HARQ-ACK request
field with value 1, and

\- the CRC of the DCI is scrambled by a C-RNTI or an MCS-C-RNTI, and

\- *resourceAllocation* = *resourceAllocationType0* and all bits of the
frequency domain resource assignment field in the DCI format are equal
to 0, or

\- *resourceAllocation* = *resourceAllocationType1* and all bits of the
frequency domain resource assignment field in the DCI format are equal
to 1, or

\- *resourceAllocation = dynamicSwitch* and all bits of the frequency
domain resource assignment field in the DCI format are equal to 0 or 1

the DCI format provides a request for a Type-3 HARQ-ACK codebook report
and does not schedule a PDSCH reception. The UE is expected to provide
HARQ-ACK information in response to the request for the Type-3 HARQ-ACK
codebook after $N$ symbols from the last symbol of a PDCCH providing the
DCI format, where the value of $N$ for $\mu = 0,1,2$ is provided in
clause 10.2 by replacing \"SPS PDSCH release\" with \"DCI format\".

If a UE multiplexes HARQ-ACK information in a PUSCH transmission, the UE
generates the HARQ-ACK codebook as described in this clause except that
*harq-ACK-SpatialBundlingPUCCH* is replaced by
*harq-ACK-SpatialBundlingPUSCH*.

9.2 UCI reporting in physical uplink control channel
----------------------------------------------------

UCI types reported in a PUCCH include HARQ-ACK information, SR, LRR, and
CSI. UCI bits include HARQ-ACK information bits, if any, SR information
bits, if any, LRR information bit, if any, and CSI bits, if any. The
HARQ-ACK information bits correspond to a HARQ-ACK codebook as described
in clause 9.1. For the remaining of this clause, any reference to SR is
applicable for SR and/or for LRR.

A UE may transmit one or two PUCCHs on a serving cell in different
symbols within a slot. When the UE transmits two PUCCHs in a slot and
the UE is not provided *ackNackFeedbackMode* = *separate*, at least one
of the two PUCCHs uses PUCCH format 0 or PUCCH format 2.

If a UE is provided *ackNackFeedbackMode* = *separate, the UE* may
transmit up to two PUCCHs with HARQ-ACK information in different symbols
within a slot.

In clauses 9.2.3, 9.2.5.1 and 9.2.5.2, a UE assumes 11 CRC bits if a
number of respective UCI bits is larger than or equal to 360; otherwise,
the UE determines a number of CRC bits based on the number of respective
UCI bits as described in \[5, TS 38.212\].

### 9.2.1 PUCCH Resource Sets

If a UE does not have dedicated PUCCH resource configuration, provided
by *PUCCH-ResourceSet* in *PUCCH-Config*, a PUCCH resource set is
provided by *pucch-ResourceCommon* through an index to a row of Table
9.2.1-1 for transmission of HARQ-ACK information on PUCCH in an initial
UL BWP of $N_{\text{BWP}}^{\text{size}}$ PRBs.

The PUCCH resource set includes sixteen resources, each corresponding to
a PUCCH format, a first symbol, a duration, a PRB offset
$\text{RB}_{\text{BWP}}^{\text{offset}}$, and a cyclic shift index set
for a PUCCH transmission.

The UE transmits a PUCCH using frequency hopping if not provided
*useInterlacePUCCH-PUSCH in BWP-UplinkCommon*; otherwise, *the UE
transmits a PUCCH without frequency hopping*.

An orthogonal cover code with index 0 is used for a PUCCH resource with
PUCCH format 1 in Table 9.2.1-1 except when index 3, 7, or 11 is
indicated by *pucch-ResourceCommon* and *useInterlacePUCCH-PUSCH in
BWP-UplinkCommon* is provided.

The UE transmits the PUCCH using the same spatial domain transmission
filter as for a PUSCH transmission scheduled by a RAR UL grant as
described in clause 8.3.

If a UE is not provided any of *pdsch-HARQ-ACK-Codebook*,
*pdsch-HARQ-ACK-Codebook-r16*, or *pdsch-HARQ-ACK-OneShotFeedback*, the
UE generates at most one HARQ-ACK information bit.

If the UE provides HARQ-ACK information in a PUCCH transmission in
response to detecting a DCI format scheduling a PDSCH reception or a SPS
PDSCH release or indicating SCell dormancy without scheduling a PDSCH
reception, the UE determines a PUCCH resource with index
$r_{\text{PUCCH}}$, $0{\leq r}_{\text{PUCCH}} \leq 15$, as
$r_{\text{PUCCH}} = \left\lfloor \frac{2{\cdot n}_{CCE,0}}{N_{\text{CCE}}} \right\rfloor + 2 \cdot \mathrm{\Delta}_{\text{PRI}}$,
where $N_{\text{CCE}}$ is a number of CCEs in a CORESET of a PDCCH
reception with the DCI format, as described in clause 10.1, $n_{CCE,0}$
is the index of a first CCE for the PDCCH reception, and
$\mathrm{\Delta}_{\text{PRI}}$ is a value of the PUCCH resource
indicator field in the DCI format.

If $\left\lfloor \frac{r_{\text{PUCCH}}}{8} \right\rfloor = 0$ and a UE
is provided a PUCCH resource by *pucch-ResourceCommon* and is not
provided *useInterlacePUCCH-PUSCH in BWP-UplinkCommon*

\- the UE determines the PRB index of the PUCCH transmission in the
first hop as
$\text{RB}_{\text{BWP}}^{\text{offset}} + \left\lfloor \frac{r_{\text{PUCCH}}}{N_{\text{CS}}} \right\rfloor$
and the PRB index of the PUCCH transmission in the second hop as
${N_{\text{BWP}}^{\text{size}} - 1 - RB}_{\text{BWP}}^{\text{offset}} - \left\lfloor \frac{r_{\text{PUCCH}}}{N_{\text{CS}}} \right\rfloor$,
where $N_{\text{CS}}$ is the total number of initial cyclic shift
indexes in the set of initial cyclic shift indexes

\- the UE determines the initial cyclic shift index in the set of
initial cyclic shift indexes as
$r_{\text{PUCCH}}\text{mod}N_{\text{CS}}$

If $\left\lfloor \frac{r_{\text{PUCCH}}}{8} \right\rfloor = 1$ and a UE
is provided a PUCCH resource by *pucch-ResourceCommon* and is not
provided *useInterlacePUCCH-PUSCH in BWP-UplinkCommon*

\- the UE determines the PRB index of the PUCCH transmission in the
first hop as
${N_{\text{BWP}}^{\text{size}} - 1 - RB}_{\text{BWP}}^{\text{offset}} - \left\lfloor \frac{\left( r_{\text{PUCCH}} - 8 \right)}{N_{\text{CS}}} \right\rfloor$
and the PRB index of the PUCCH transmission in the second hop as
$\text{RB}_{\text{BWP}}^{\text{offset}} + \left\lfloor \frac{\left( r_{\text{PUCCH}} - 8 \right)}{N_{\text{CS}}} \right\rfloor$

\- the UE determines the initial cyclic shift index in the set of
initial cyclic shift indexes as ![](media/image529.wmf)

If a UE is provided a PUCCH resource by *pucch-ResourceCommon* and is
provided *useInterlacePUCCH-PUSCH in BWP-UplinkCommon*

\- the UE determines for the PUCCH resource an interlace index $m$ as
$m = \left( m_{0} + \left\lfloor \frac{r_{\text{PUCCH}}}{N_{\text{CS}}} \right\rfloor \right)\text{mod}M$
where $M$ is a number of interlaces \[4, TS 38.211\] and
$m_{0} = \text{RB}_{\text{BWP}}^{\text{offset}}$ is an interlace index
offset and $\text{RB}_{\text{BWP}}^{\text{offset}}$ is as given in Table
9.2.1-1

\- the UE determines an initial cyclic shift index in a set of initial
cyclic shift indexes as $r_{\text{PUCCH}}\text{mod}N_{\text{CS}}$, where
$N_{\text{CS}}$ is the total number of initial cyclic shifts indexes in
the set of initial cyclic shift indexes in Table 9.2.1-1

\- if *pucch-ResourceCommon* indicates

\- index 0: the first symbol is 9 for a PUCCH resource with PUCCH format
0 if $r_{\text{PUCCH}} \geq 10$

\- index 1 or 2: the first symbol is 9 for a PUCCH resource with PUCCH
format 0 if $r_{\text{PUCCH}} = 15$

\- index 3, 7, or 11: an orthogonal cover code with index 1 is used for
a PUCCH resource with PUCCH format 1 if $r_{\text{PUCCH}} \geq 10$;
otherwise, an orthogonal cover code with index 0 is used for a PUCCH
resource with PUCCH format 1

\- the UE does not expect *pucch-ResourceCommon* to indicate index 15

If a UE has dedicated PUCCH resource configuration, the UE is provided
by higher layers with one or more PUCCH resources.

A PUCCH resource includes the following parameters:

\- a PUCCH resource index provided by *pucch-ResourceId*

\- an index of the first PRB prior to frequency hopping or for no
frequency hopping by *startingPRB*, if a UE is not provided
*useInterlacePUCCH-PUSCH in BWP-UplinkDedicated*

\- an index of the first PRB after frequency hopping by *secondHopPRB*,
if a UE is not provided *useInterlacePUCCH-PUSCH in BWP-UplinkDedicated*

\- an indication for intra-slot frequency hopping by
*intraSlotFrequencyHopping*, if a UE is not provided
*useInterlacePUCCH-PUSCH in BWP-UplinkDedicated*

\- an index of a first interlace by *interlace0*, if a UE is provided
*useInterlacePUCCH-PUSCH in BWP-UplinkDedicated*

\- if provided, an index of a second interlace by *interlace1*, if a UE
is provided *useInterlacePUCCH-PUSCH in BWP-UplinkDedicated*

\- an index of an RB set by *rb-SetIndex*, if a UE is provided
*useInterlacePUCCH-PUSCH in BWP-UplinkDedicated*

\- a configuration for a PUCCH format provided by *format*

For operation with shared spectrum channel access, the UE does not
expect that two hops of a PUCCH transmission are in different RB sets.

The UE expects that *useInterlacePUCCH-PUSCH in BWP-UplinkCommon and
useInterlacePUCCH-PUSCH in BWP-UplinkDedicated are provided either in
all UL BWPs or in none of the UL BWPs for a serving cell*.

If a UE is provided *useInterlacePUCCH-PUSCH in BWP-UplinkDedicated*,
the UE determines available RBs for PUCCH transmissions within the
active UL BWP as the intersection of RBs *corresponding to an interlace
index provided by interlace0 and, if provided, interlace1, and RBs of an
RB set provided by rb-SetIndex. The intersection results in*
$M_{\text{interlace,0}}^{\text{PUCCH}}$ *RBs in the first interlace and
the UE expects that* $M_{\text{interlace,0}}^{\text{PUCCH}}$ *is either
10 or 11. If interlace1 is provided, the intersection results in*
$M_{\text{interlace,1}}^{\text{PUCCH}}$ *RBs in the second interlace and
the UE expects that* $M_{\text{interlace,1}}^{\text{PUCCH}}$ *is either
10 or 11.*

If the *format* indicates *PUCCH-format0*, the PUCCH format configured
for a PUCCH resource is PUCCH format 0, where the PUCCH resource also
includes an index for an initial cyclic shift provided by
*initialCyclicShift*, a number of symbols for a PUCCH transmission
provided by *nrofSymbols*, a first symbol for the PUCCH transmission
provided by *startingSymbolIndex*.

If the *format* indicates *PUCCH-format1*, the PUCCH format configured
for a PUCCH resource is PUCCH format 1, where the PUCCH resource also
includes an index for an initial cyclic shift provided by
*initialCyclicShift*, a number of symbols for a PUCCH transmission
provided by *nrofSymbols*, a first symbol for the PUCCH transmission
provided by *startingSymbolIndex*, and an index for an orthogonal cover
code by *timeDomainOCC*.

If the *format* indicates *PUCCH-format2* or *PUCCH-format3*, the PUCCH
format configured for a PUCCH resource is PUCCH format 2 or PUCCH format
3, respectively, where the PUCCH resource also includes a number of PRBs
provided by *nrofPRBs*, a number of symbols for a PUCCH transmission
provided by *nrofSymbols*, and a first symbol for the PUCCH transmission
provided by *startingSymbolIndex*. If a UE is provided by
*useInterlacePUCCH-PUSCH in BWP-UplinkDedicated,* and the *format*
indicates *PUCCH-format2* or *PUCCH-format3 and PUCCH-ResourceExt* is
provided, the PUCCH resource also includes an index of a second
interlace by *interlace1, if provided*; otherwise, *if interlace1* is
not provided, the PUCCH resource also includes, if provided, an
orthogonal cover code length by *occ-Length* and an orthogonal cover
code index by *occ-Index*. If the *format* indicates *PUCCH-format3 and
PUCCH-ResourceExt* is provided*, the UE assumes that the*
$M_{\text{RB}}^{\text{PUCCH,}3}$ *\[4, TS 38.211\] PRBs with the lowest
indexes within the first, and if configured, second interlace are used
for PUCCH transmission.*

If the *format* indicates *PUCCH-format4*, the PUCCH format configured
for a PUCCH resource is PUCCH format 4, where the PUCCH resource also
includes a number of symbols for a PUCCH transmission provided by
*nrofSymbols*, an orthogonal cover code length by *occ-Length*, an
orthogonal cover code index by *occ-Index*, and a first symbol for the
PUCCH transmission provided by *startingSymbolIndex*.

If a UE is provided *subslotLengthForPUCCH* in a *PUCCH-Config*, the
first symbol of a PUCCH resource provided by *PUCCH-ResourceSet* or
*SPS-PUCCH-AN-List* in *PUCCH-Config* or by *n1PUCCH-AN* in SPS-Config
for multiplexing HARQ-ACK in a PUCCH transmission is relative to the
first symbol of the *subslotLengthForPUCCH* symbols \[12, TS 38.331\].
For the remaining cases, the first symbol of a PUCCH resource is
relative to the first symbol of a slot with
$N_{\text{sym}}^{\text{slot}}$ symbols \[4, TS 38.211\].

A UE can be configured up to four sets of PUCCH resources in a
*PUCCH-Config*. A PUCCH resource set is provided by *PUCCH-ResourceSet*
and is associated with a PUCCH resource set index provided by
*pucch-ResourceSetId*, with a set of PUCCH resource indexes provided by
*resourceList* that provides a set of *pucch-ResourceId* used in the
PUCCH resource set, and with a maximum number of UCI information bits
the UE can transmit using a PUCCH resource in the PUCCH resource set
provided by *maxPayloadSize*. For the first PUCCH resource set, the
maximum number of UCI information bits is 2. A maximum number of PUCCH
resource indexes for a set of PUCCH resources is provided by
*maxNrofPUCCH-ResourcesPerSet*. The maximum number of PUCCH resources in
the first PUCCH resource set is 32 and the maximum number of PUCCH
resources in the other PUCCH resource sets is 8.

If the UE transmits $O_{\text{UCI}}$ UCI information bits, that include
HARQ-ACK information bits, the UE determines a PUCCH resource set to be

\- a first set of PUCCH resources with *pucch-ResourceSetId* = 0 if
$O_{\text{UCI}} \leq 2$ including 1 or 2 HARQ-ACK information bits and a
positive or negative SR on one SR transmission occasion if transmission
of HARQ-ACK information and SR occurs simultaneously, or

\- a second set of PUCCH resources with *pucch-ResourceSetId* = 1, if
provided by higher layers, if ${2 < O}_{\text{UCI}} \leq N_{2}$ where
$N_{2}$ is equal to *maxPayloadSize* if *maxPayloadSize* is provided for
the PUCCH resource set with *pucch-ResourceSetId* = 1; otherwise
$N_{2}$is equal to 1706, or

\- a third set of PUCCH resources with *pucch-ResourceSetId* = 2, if
provided by higher layers, if ${N_{2} < O}_{\text{UCI}} \leq N_{3}$
where $N_{3}$ is equal to *maxPayloadSize* if *maxPayloadSize* is
provided for the PUCCH resource set with *pucch-ResourceSetId* = 2;
otherwise $N_{3}$is equal to 1706, or

\- a fourth set of PUCCH resources with *pucch-ResourceSetId* = 3, if
provided by higher layers, if ${N_{3} < O}_{\text{UCI}} \leq 1706$.

If the UE is provided *SPS-PUCCH-AN-List* and transmits $O_{\text{UCI}}$
UCI information bits that include only HARQ-ACK information bits in
response to one or more SPS PDSCH receptions and SR, if any, the UE
determines a PUCCH resource to be

\- a PUCCH resource provided by *sps-PUCCH-AN-ResourceID* obtained from
the first entry in *sps-PUCCH-AN-List* if $O_{\text{UCI}} \leq 2$
including 1 or 2 HARQ-ACK information bits and a positive or negative SR
on one SR transmission occasion if transmission of HARQ-ACK information
and SR occurs simultaneously, or

\- a PUCCH resource provided by *sps-PUCCH-AN-ResourceID* obtained from
the second entry in *sps-PUCCH-AN-List*, if provided, if
$2 < O_{\text{UCI}} \leq N_{1,SPS}$ where $N_{1,SPS}$ is either provided
by *maxPayloadSize* obtained from the second entry in
*sps-PUCCH-AN-List* or is otherwise equal to 1706, or

\- a PUCCH resource provided by *sps-PUCCH-AN-ResourceID* obtained from
the third entry in *sps-PUCCH-AN-List*, if provided, if
$N_{1,SPS} < O_{\text{UCI}} \leq N_{2,SPS}$ where $N_{2,SPS}$ is either
provided by *maxPayloadSize* obtained from the third entry in
*sps-PUCCH-AN-List* or is otherwise equal to 1706, or

\- a PUCCH resource provided by *sps-PUCCH-AN-ResourceID* obtained from
the fourth entry in *sps-PUCCH-AN-List*, if provided, if
$N_{2,SPS} < O_{\text{UCI}} \leq N_{3,SPS}$ where $N_{3,SPS}$ is equal
to 1706.

### 9.2.2 PUCCH Formats for UCI transmission

If a UE is not transmitting PUSCH, and the UE is transmitting UCI, the
UE transmits UCI in a PUCCH using

\- PUCCH format 0 if

\- the transmission is over 1 symbol or 2 symbols,

\- the number of HARQ-ACK information bits with positive or negative SR
(HARQ-ACK/SR bits) is 1 or 2

\- PUCCH format 1 if

\- the transmission is over 4 or more symbols,

\- the number of HARQ-ACK/SR bits is 1 or 2

\- PUCCH format 2 if

\- the transmission is over 1 symbol or 2 symbols,

\- the number of UCI bits is more than 2

\- PUCCH format 3 if

\- the transmission is over 4 or more symbols,

\- the number of UCI bits is more than 2,

> \- the PUCCH resource does not include an orthogonal cover code, or
> the UE is provided *useInterlacePUCCH-PUSCH* in *BWP-UplinkDedicated*

\- PUCCH format 4 if

\- the transmission is over 4 or more symbols,

\- the number of UCI bits is more than 2,

\- the PUCCH resource includes an orthogonal cover code and the UE is
not provided *useInterlacePUCCH-PUSCH* in *BWP-UplinkDedicated*

A spatial setting for a PUCCH transmission is provided by
*PUCCH-SpatialRelationInfo* if the UE is configured with a single value
for *pucch-SpatialRelationInfoId*; otherwise, if the UE is provided
multiple values for *PUCCH-SpatialRelationInfo*, the UE determines a
spatial setting for the PUCCH transmission as described in \[11, TS
38.321\]. **The UE applies corresponding actions in \[11, TS 38.321\]
and a corresponding setting for a spatial domain filter to transmit
PUCCH** in the first slot that is after slot ![](media/image196.wmf)
where ![](media/image197.wmf) is the slot **where the UE would transmit
a PUCCH with HARQ-ACK information with ACK value corresponding to a
PDSCH reception providing the *PUCCH-SpatialRelationInfo*, each slot**
consists of $N_{\text{symb}}^{\text{slot}}$ symbols as defined in \[4,
TS 38.211\], and ![](media/image198.wmf) is the SCS configuration for
the PUCCH

\- If *PUCCH-SpatialRelationInfo* provides *ssb-Index*, the UE transmits
the PUCCH using a same spatial domain filter as for a reception of a
SS/PBCH block with index provided by *ssb-Index* for a same serving cell
or, if *servingCellId* is provided, for a serving cell indicated by
*servingCellId*

\- else if *PUCCH-SpatialRelationInfo* provides *csi-RS-Index*, the UE
transmits the PUCCH using a same spatial domain filter as for a
reception of a CSI-RS with resource index provided by *csi-RS-Index* for
a same serving cell or, if *servingCellId* is provided, for a serving
cell indicated by *servingCellId*

\- else *PUCCH-SpatialRelationInfo* provides *srs*, the UE transmits the
PUCCH using a same spatial domain filter as for a transmission of a SRS
with resource index provided by *resource* for a same serving cell
*and/or active UL BWP* or, if *servingCellId* and/or *uplinkBWP* are
provided, for a serving cell indicated by *servingCellId and/or for an
UL BWP indicated by uplinkBWP*

If a UE

\- is not provided *pathlossReferenceRSs* in *PUCCH-PowerControl,*

\- is provided *enableDefaultBeamPL-ForPUCCH*, and

\- is not provided *PUCCH-SpatialRelationInfo*, *and*

\- is not provided *coresetPoolIndex* value of 1 for any CORESET, or is
provided *coresetPoolIndex* value of 1 for all CORESETs, in
*ControlResourceSet *and no codepoint of a TCI field, if any, in a DCI
format of any search space set maps to two TCI states \[5, TS 38.212\]

*a spatial setting for a PUCCH transmission from the UE is same as a*
spatial setting for PDCCH receptions by the UE in the CORESET with the
lowest ID on the active DL BWP of the PCell. For a PUCCH transmission
over multiple slots, a same spatial setting applies to the PUCCH
transmission in each of the multiple slots.

A number of DMRS symbols for a PUCCH transmission using PUCCH format 3
or 4 is provided by *additionalDMRS*.

Use of π/2-BPSK, instead of QPSK, for a PUCCH transmission using PUCCH
format 3 or 4 is indicated by *pi2BPSK*.

### 9.2.3 UE procedure for reporting HARQ-ACK

A UE does not expect to transmit more than one PUCCH with HARQ-ACK
information in a slot per priority index, if the UE is not provided
*ackNackFeedbackMode = separate*.

For DCI format 1\_0, the PDSCH-to-HARQ\_feedback timing indicator field
values map to {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}. For a DCI format, other than DCI
format 1\_0, the PDSCH-to-HARQ\_feedback timing indicator field values,
if present, map to values for a set of number of slots provided by
*dl-DataToUL-ACK, dl-DataToUL-ACK-r16,* or *dl-DataToUL-ACK-DCI-1-2*, as
defined in Table 9.2.3-1.

If the UE is provided *subslotLengthForPUCCH*, $n$ is the last UL slot
that overlaps with the PDSCH reception or with the PDCCH reception in
case of SPS PDSCH release or in case of SCell dormancy indication or in
case of the DCI format that requests Type-3 HARQ-ACK codebook report and
does not schedule a PDSCH reception; otherwise, $n$ is the last UL slot
that overlaps with the DL slot $n_{D}$ for the PDSCH reception or with
the DL slot $n_{D}\ $for the PDCCH reception in case of SPS PDSCH
release or in case of SCell dormancy indication or in case of the DCI
format that requests Type-3 HARQ-ACK codebook report and does not
schedule a PDSCH reception.

For a SPS PDSCH reception ending in DL slot $n_{D}$, the UE transmits
the PUCCH in UL slot $n + k$ where $k$ is provided by the
PDSCH-to-HARQ\_feedback timing indicator field, if present, in a DCI
format activating the SPS PDSCH reception.

If the UE detects a DCI format that does not include a
PDSCH-to-HARQ\_feedback timing indicator field and schedules a PDSCH
reception or activates a SPS PDSCH reception ending in DL slot $n_{D}$,
the UE provides corresponding HARQ-ACK information in a PUCCH
transmission within UL slot $n + k$ where $k$ is provided by
*dl-DataToUL-ACK*, or *dl-DataToUL-ACK-r16,* or
*dl-DataToUL-ACK-DCI-1-2*.

If the UE detects a DCI format scheduling a PDSCH reception ending in DL
slot $n_{D}$ or if the UE detects a DCI format indicating a SPS PDSCH
release or indicating SCell dormancy through a PDCCH reception ending in
DL slot $n_{D}$, or if the UE detects a DCI format that requests Type-3
HARQ-ACK codebook report and does not schedule a PDSCH reception through
a PDCCH reception ending in DL slot $n_{D}$, as described in clause
9.1.4, the UE provides corresponding HARQ-ACK information in a PUCCH
transmission within UL slot $n + k$, where $k$ is a number of slots and
is indicated by the PDSCH-to-HARQ\_feedback timing indicator field in
the DCI format, if present, or provided by *dl-DataToUL-ACK*,
*dl-DataToUL-ACK-r16,* or *dl-DataToUL-ACK-DCI-1-2*.

A PUCCH transmission with HARQ-ACK information is subject to the
limitations for UE transmissions described in clause 11.1 and clause
11.1.1.

For a PUCCH transmission with HARQ-ACK information, a UE determines a
PUCCH resource after determining a set of PUCCH resources for
![](media/image533.wmf) HARQ-ACK information bits, as described in
clause 9.2.1. The PUCCH resource determination is based on a PUCCH
resource indicator field \[5, TS 38.212\], if present, in a last DCI
format, excluding the SPS activation DCI, among the DCI formats that
have a value of a PDSCH-to-HARQ\_feedback timing indicator field, if
present, or a value of *dl-DataToUL-ACK*, *or dl-DataToUL-ACK-r16,* or
*dl-DataToUL-ACK-DCI-1-2*, indicating a same slot for the PUCCH
transmission, that the UE detects and for which the UE transmits
corresponding HARQ-ACK information in the PUCCH where, for PUCCH
resource determination, detected DCI formats are first indexed in an
ascending order across serving cells indexes for a same PDCCH monitoring
occasion and are then indexed in an ascending order across PDCCH
monitoring occasion indexes. For indexing DCI formats within a serving
cell for a same PDCCH monitoring occasion, if the UE is not provided
*coresetPoolIndex* or is provided *coresetPoolIndex* with value 0 for
one or more first CORESETs and is provided *coresetPoolIndex* with value
1 for one or more second CORESETs on an active DL BWP of a serving cell,
and with *ackNackFeedbackMode* = *joint for the active UL BWP, detected
DCI formats from PDCCH receptions in the first CORESETs are indexed
prior to detected DCI formats from PDCCH receptions in the second
CORESETs*.

The PUCCH resource indicator field values map to values of a set of
PUCCH resource indexes, as defined in Table 9.2.3-2 for a PUCCH resource
indicator field of 3 bits, provided by *resourceList* for PUCCH
resources from a set of PUCCH resources provided by *PUCCH-ResourceSet*
with a maximum of eight PUCCH resources. If the PUCCH resource indicator
field includes 1 bit or 2 bits, the values map to the first two values
or the first four values, respectively, of Table 9.2.3-2. If the last
DCI format does not include a PUCCH resource indicator field, the first
value of Table 9.2.3-2 is used.

For the first set of PUCCH resources and when the size
![](media/image534.wmf) of *resourceList* is larger than eight, when a
UE provides HARQ-ACK information in a PUCCH transmission in response to
detecting a last DCI format in a PDCCH reception, excluding the SPS
activation DCI, among DCI formats with a value of the
PDSCH-to-HARQ\_feedback timing indicator field, if present, or a value
of *dl-DataToUL-ACK*, *or dl-DataToUL-ACK-r16,* or
*dl-DataToUL-ACK-DCI-1-2*, indicating a same slot for the PUCCH
transmission, the UE determines a PUCCH resource with index
![](media/image535.wmf), ![](media/image536.wmf), as

![](media/image537.wmf)

where ![](media/image538.wmf) is a number of CCEs in CORESET
![](media/image539.wmf) of the PDCCH reception for the DCI format as
described in clause 10.1, ![](media/image540.wmf) is the index of a
first CCE for the PDCCH reception, and $\mathrm{\Delta}_{\text{PRI}}$ is
a value of the PUCCH resource indicator field in the DCI format. If the
DCI format does not include a PUCCH resource indicator field,
$\mathrm{\Delta}_{\text{PRI}} = 0$.

  -------------------------- ---------------- --------- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If a UE determines a first resource for a PUCCH transmission with
HARQ-ACK information corresponding only to a PDSCH reception without a
corresponding PDCCH or detects a first DCI format indicating a first
resource for a PUCCH transmission with corresponding HARQ-ACK
information in a slot and also detects at a later time a second DCI
format indicating a second resource for a PUCCH transmission with
corresponding HARQ-ACK information in the slot, the UE does not expect
to multiplex HARQ-ACK information corresponding to the second DCI format
in a PUCCH resource in the slot if the PDCCH reception that includes the
second DCI format is not earlier than ![](media/image541.wmf) from the
beginning of a first symbol of the first resource for PUCCH transmission
in the slot where, $\kappa$ and $T_{c}$ are defined in clause 4.1 of
\[4, TS 38.211\] and ![](media/image542.wmf) corresponds to the smallest
SCS configuration among the SCS configurations of the PDCCHs providing
the DCI formats and the SCS configuration of the PUCCH. If
*processingType2Enabled* of *PDSCH-ServingCellConfig* is set to *enable*
for the serving cell with the second DCI format and for all serving
cells with corresponding HARQ-ACK information multiplexed in the PUCCH
transmission in the slot,![](media/image543.wmf) for
![](media/image544.wmf), ![](media/image545.wmf) for
![](media/image546.wmf), ![](media/image547.wmf) for
![](media/image548.wmf); otherwise , ![](media/image549.wmf) for
![](media/image550.wmf), ![](media/image551.wmf) for
![](media/image546.wmf), ![](media/image552.wmf) for
![](media/image548.wmf), ![](media/image553.wmf) for
![](media/image554.wmf).

If a UE *is not provided SPS-PUCCH-AN-List and* transmits HARQ-ACK
information corresponding only to a PDSCH reception without a
corresponding PDCCH, which includes the first SPS PDSCH reception
associated with the corresponding activation DCI, a PUCCH resource for
corresponding PUCCH transmission with HARQ-ACK information is provided
by *n1PUCCH-AN*.

If a UE transmits a PUCCH with HARQ-ACK information using PUCCH format
0, the UE determines values ![](media/image555.wmf) and
![](media/image556.wmf) for computing a value of cyclic shift
![](media/image557.wmf) \[4, TS 38.211\] where ![](media/image555.wmf)
is provided by *initialCyclicShift* of *PUCCH-format0* or, if
*initialCyclicShift* is not provided, by the initial cyclic shift index
as described in clause 9.2.1 and ![](media/image556.wmf) is determined
from the value of one HARQ-ACK information bit or from the values of two
HARQ-ACK information bits as in Table 9.2.3-3 and Table 9.2.3-4,
respectively.

  --------------------------- ------------------------- ------------------------- ------------------------- -------------------------

If a UE transmits a PUCCH with HARQ-ACK information using PUCCH format
1, the UE is provided a value for ![](media/image555.wmf) by
*initialCyclicShift* of *PUCCH-format1* or, if *initialCyclicShift* is
not provided, by the initial cyclic shift index as described in clause
9.2.1.

If a UE transmits a PUCCH with ![](media/image486.wmf) HARQ-ACK
information bits and ![](media/image564.wmf) bits using PUCCH format 2
or PUCCH format 3 in a PUCCH resource that includes
![](media/image565.wmf) PRBs, the UE determines a number of PRBs
![](media/image566.wmf) for the PUCCH transmission to be the minimum
number of PRBs, that is smaller than or equal to a number of PRBs
![](media/image565.wmf) provided respectively by *nrofPRBs* of
*PUCCH-format2* or *nrofPRBs* of *PUCCH-format3* and start from the
first PRB from the number of PRBs, that results to
![](media/image567.wmf) and, if ![](media/image568.wmf),
![](media/image569.wmf), where ![](media/image570.wmf),
![](media/image571.wmf), ![](media/image572.wmf), and
![](media/image573.wmf) are defined in clause 9.2.5.2. For PUCCH format
3, if ![](media/image574.wmf) is not equal ![](media/image575.wmf)
according to \[4, TS 38.211\], ![](media/image576.wmf) is increased to
the nearest allowed value of *nrofPRBs* for *PUCCH-format3* \[12, TS
38.331\]. If ![](media/image577.wmf), the UE transmits the PUCCH over
![](media/image578.wmf) PRBs.

If a UE is provided a first interlace of
$M_{\text{Interlace,0}}^{\text{PUCCH}}$ PRBs by *interlace0* in
*InterlaceAllocation* and transmits a PUCCH with $O_{\text{ACK}}$
HARQ-ACK information bits and $O_{\text{CRC}}$ bits using PUCCH format 2
or PUCCH format 3, the UE transmits the PUCCH over the first interlace
if
$\left( O_{\text{ACK}} + O_{\text{CRC}} \right) \leq M_{\text{Interlace,0}}^{\text{PUCCH}} \cdot N_{\text{sc,ctrl}}^{\text{RB}} \cdot N_{\text{symb-UCI}}^{\text{PUCCH}} \cdot Q_{m} \cdot r$;
otherwise, if the UE is provided a second interlace by *interlace1* in
*PUCCH-format2* or *PUCCH-format3*, the UE transmits the PUCCH over the
first and second interlaces.

### 9.2.4 UE procedure for reporting SR

A UE can be configured by *SchedulingRequestResourceConfig* a set of
configurations for SR in a PUCCH transmission using either PUCCH format
0 or PUCCH format 1. A UE can be configured by
*schedulingRequestID-BFR-SCell* a configuration for LRR in a PUCCH
transmission using either PUCCH format 0 or PUCCH format 1. A UE can be
configured by *schedulingRequestID-LBT-SCell* a configuration for
consistent LBT failure recovery, as described in \[11, TS 38.321\], in a
PUCCH transmission using either PUCCH format 0 or PUCCH format 1. The UE
can be provided, by *phy-PriorityIndex* in
*SchedulingRequestResourceConfig*, a priority index 0 or a priority
index 1 for the SR. If the UE is not provided a priority index for SR,
the priority index is 0.

The UE is configured a PUCCH resource by *SchedulingRequestResourceId*,
or by *schedulingRequestID-BFR-SCell*, or by
*schedulingRequestID-LBT-SCell*, providing a PUCCH format 0 resource or
a PUCCH format 1 resource as described in clause 9.2.1. The UE is also
configured a periodicity ![](media/image579.wmf) in symbols or slots and
an offset ![](media/image580.wmf) in slots by *periodicityAndOffset* for
a PUCCH transmission conveying SR. If ![](media/image579.wmf) is larger
than one slot, the UE determines a SR transmission occasion in a PUCCH
to be in a slot with number ![](media/image581.wmf) \[4, TS 38.211\] in
a frame with number ![](media/image582.wmf) if ![](media/image583.wmf).

If ![](media/image579.wmf) is one slot, the UE expects that
![](media/image584.wmf) and every slot is a SR transmission occasion in
a PUCCH.

If ![](media/image579.wmf) is smaller than one slot, the UE determines a
SR transmission occasion in a PUCCH to start in a symbol with index
![](media/image585.wmf) \[4, TS 38.211\] if ![](media/image586.wmf)
where ![](media/image587.wmf) is the value of *startingSymbolIndex*.

If the UE determines that, for a SR transmission occasion in a PUCCH,
the number of symbols available for the PUCCH transmission in a slot is
smaller than the value provided by *nrofSymbols*, the UE does not
transmit the PUCCH in the slot.

SR transmission occasions in a PUCCH are subject to the limitations for
UE transmissions described in clause 11.1 and clause 11.1.1.

The UE transmits a PUCCH in the PUCCH resource for the corresponding SR
configuration only when the UE transmits a positive SR. For a positive
SR transmission using PUCCH format 0, the UE transmits the PUCCH as
described in \[4, TS 38.211\] by obtaining ![](media/image555.wmf) as
described for HARQ-ACK information in clause 9.2.3 and by setting
![](media/image588.wmf). For a positive SR transmission using PUCCH
format 1, the UE transmits the PUCCH as described in \[4, TS 38.211\] by
setting ![](media/image589.wmf).

### 9.2.5 UE procedure for reporting multiple UCI types

This clause is applicable to the case that a UE has resources for PUCCH
transmissions or for PUCCH and PUSCH transmissions that overlap in time
and each PUCCH transmission is over a single slot without repetitions.
Any case that a PUCCH transmission is with repetitions over multiple
slots is described in clause 9.2.6. If a UE is configured with multiple
PUCCH resources in a slot to transmit CSI reports

\- if the UE is not provided *multi-CSI-PUCCH-ResourceList* or if PUCCH
resources for transmissions of CSI reports do not overlap in the slot,
the UE determines a first resource corresponding to a CSI report with
the highest priority \[6, TS 38.214\]

\- if the first resource includes PUCCH format 2, and if there are
remaining resources in the slot that do not overlap with the first
resource, the UE determines a CSI report with the highest priority,
among the CSI reports with corresponding resources from the remaining
resources, and a corresponding second resource as an additional resource
for CSI reporting

\- if the first resource includes PUCCH format 3 or PUCCH format 4, and
if there are remaining resources in the slot that include PUCCH format 2
and do not overlap with the first resource, the UE determines a CSI
report with the highest priority, among the CSI reports with
corresponding resources from the remaining resources, and a
corresponding second resource as an additional resource for CSI
reporting

\- if the UE is provided *multi-CSI-PUCCH-ResourceList* and if any of
the multiple PUCCH resources overlap, the UE multiplexes all CSI reports
in a resource from the resources provided by
*multi-CSI-PUCCH-ResourceList*, as described in clause 9.2.5.2.

A UE multiplexes DL HARQ-ACK information, with or without SR, and CSI
report(s) in a same PUCCH if the UE is provided
*simultaneousHARQ-ACK-CSI*; otherwise, the UE drops the CSI report(s)
and includes only DL HARQ-ACK information, with or without SR, in the
PUCCH. If the UE would transmit multiple PUCCHs in a slot that include
DL HARQ-ACK information and CSI report(s), the UE expects to be provided
a same configuration for *simultaneousHARQ-ACK-CSI* each of PUCCH
formats 2, 3, and 4.

If a UE would multiplex CSI reports that include Part 2 CSI reports in a
PUCCH resource, the UE determines the PUCCH resource and a number of
PRBs for the PUCCH resource or a number of Part 2 CSI reports assuming
that each of the CSI reports indicates rank 1.

If a UE would transmit multiple overlapping PUCCHs in a slot or
overlapping PUCCH(s) and PUSCH(s) in a slot and, when applicable as
described in clauses 9.2.5.1 and 9.2.5.2, the UE is configured to
multiplex different UCI types in one PUCCH, and at least one of the
multiple overlapping PUCCHs or PUSCHs is in response to a DCI format
detection by the UE, the UE multiplexes all corresponding UCI types if
the following conditions are met. If one of the PUCCH transmissions or
PUSCH transmissions is in response to a DCI format detection by the UE,
the UE expects that the first symbol $S_{0}$ of the earliest PUCCH or
PUSCH, among a group overlapping PUCCHs and PUSCHs in the slot,
satisfies the following timeline conditions

\- $S_{0}$ is not before a symbol with CP starting after
$T_{proc,1}^{\text{mux}}$ after a last symbol of any corresponding
PDSCH, $T_{proc,1}^{\text{mux}}$ is given by maximum of
$\left\{ T_{proc,1}^{mux,1},\cdots,T_{proc,1}^{mux,i},\cdots \right\}$
where for the i-th PDSCH with corresponding HARQ-ACK transmission on a
PUCCH which is in the group of overlapping PUCCHs and PUSCHs,
$T_{proc,1}^{mux,i} = \left( N_{1} + d_{1,1} + 1 \right) \cdot \left( 2048 + 144 \right) \cdot \kappa \cdot 2^{- \mu} \cdot T_{C}$,
$d_{1,1}$ is selected for the i-th PDSCH following \[6, TS 38.214\],
$N_{1}$ is selected based on the UE PDSCH processing capability of the
i-th PDSCH and SCS configuration $\mu$, where $\mu$ corresponds to the
smallest SCS configuration among the SCS configurations used for the
PDCCH scheduling the i-th PDSCH, the i-th PDSCH, the PUCCH with
corresponding HARQ-ACK transmission for the i-th PDSCH, and all PUSCHs
in the group of overlapping PUCCHs and PUSCHs.

\- $S_{0}$ is not before a symbol with CP starting after
$T_{proc,release}^{\text{mux}}$ after a last symbol of any corresponding
SPS PDSCH release or of a DCI format 1\_1 indicating SCell dormancy as
described in clause 10.3, or of a DCI format 1\_1 indicating a request
for a Type-3 HARQ-ACK codebook report without scheduling PDSCH.
$T_{proc,release}^{\text{mux}}$ is given by maximum of
$\left\{ T_{proc,release}^{mux,1},\cdots,T_{proc,release}^{mux,i},\cdots \right\}$
where for the i-th PDCCH providing the SPS PDSCH release or the DCI
format 1\_1 with corresponding HARQ-ACK transmission on a PUCCH which is
in the group of overlapping PUCCHs and PUSCHs,
$T_{proc,release}^{mux,i} = \left( N + 1 \right) \cdot \left( 2048 + 144 \right) \cdot \kappa \cdot 2^{- \mu} \cdot T_{C}$,
$N$ as described in clause 10.2, or DCI format 1\_1 that requests Type-3
HARQ-ACK codebook report as described in clause 10.2, or the DCI format
1\_1 indicating SCell dormancy without scheduling a PDSCH reception as
described in clause 10.3, where $\mu$ corresponds to the smallest SCS
configuration among the SCS configurations used for the PDCCH providing
the i-th SPS PDSCH release or the DCI format 1\_1, the PUCCH with
corresponding HARQ-ACK transmission for the i-th SPS PDSCH release or
the DCI format 1\_1, and all PUSCHs in the group of overlapping PUCCHs
and PUSCHs.

\- if there is no aperiodic CSI report multiplexed in a PUSCH in the
group of overlapping PUCCHs and PUSCHs, $S_{0}$ is not before a symbol
with CP starting after $T_{proc,2}^{\text{mux}}$ after a last symbol of

\- any PDCCH with the DCI format scheduling an overlapping PUSCH, and

\- any PDCCH scheduling a PDSCH or SPS PDSCH release, or a DCI format
1\_1 indicating SCell dormancy, or a DCI format 1\_1 indicating a
request for a Type-3 HARQ-ACK codebook report without scheduling PDSCH,
with corresponding HARQ-ACK information in an overlapping PUCCH in the
slot

\- if there is an aperiodic CSI report multiplexed in a PUSCH in the
group of overlapping PUCCHs and PUSCHs, $S_{0}$ is not before a symbol
with CP starting after
$T_{proc,CSI}^{\text{mux}} = \max\left( \left( Z + d \right) \cdot \left( 2048 + 144 \right) \cdot \kappa \cdot 2^{- \mu} \cdot T_{C} + T_{\text{switch}},d_{2,2} \right)$
after a last symbol of

\- any PDCCH with the DCI format scheduling an overlapping PUSCH, and

\- any PDCCH scheduling a PDSCH, or SPS PDSCH release, or providing a
DCI format 1\_1 indicating SCell dormancy, or a DCI format 1\_1
indicating a request for a Type-3 HARQ-ACK codebook report without
scheduling PDSCH, with corresponding HARQ-ACK information in an
overlapping PUCCH in the slot

\- $N_{1}$, $N_{2}$, $d_{1,1}$, $d_{2,1}$, $d_{2,2}$, and $Z$ $\ $are
defined in \[6, TS 38.214\] and $\kappa$ and $T_{C}$ are defined in \[4,
TS 38.211\].

If a UE would transmit multiple overlapping PUCCHs in a slot or
overlapping PUCCH(s) and PUSCH(s) in a slot, one of the PUCCHs includes
HARQ-ACK information in response to an SPS PDSCH reception, and any
PUSCH is not in response to a DCI format detection, the UE expects that
the first symbol ![](media/image590.wmf) of the earliest PUCCH or PUSCH
satisfies the first of the previous timeline conditions with the
exception that components associated to a SCS configuration for a PDCCH
scheduling a PDSCH or a PUSCH are absent from the timeline conditions.

A UE does not expect a PUCCH or a PUSCH that is in response to a DCI
format detection to overlap with any other PUCCH or PUSCH that does not
satisfy the above timing conditions.

A UE that

\- is not provided *coresetPoolIndex* or is provided *coresetPoolIndex*
with a value of 0 for first CORESETs on active DL BWPs of serving cells,
and

\- is provided *coresetPoolIndex* with a value of 1 for second CORESETs
on active DL BWPs of the serving cells, and

\- is provided *ackNackFeedbackMode* = *separate*

does not expect a PUCCH or a PUSCH transmission triggered by a detection
of a DCI format in a PDCCH received in a CORESET from the first CORESETs
to overlap in time with a PUCCH or a PUSCH transmission triggered by a
detection of a DCI format in a PDCCH received in a CORESET from the
second CORESETs.

If there is one or more aperiodic CSI reports multiplexed on a PUSCH in
the group of overlapping PUCCHs and PUSCHs and if symbol
![](media/image590.wmf) is before symbol ![](media/image591.wmf) that is
a next uplink symbol with CP starting after ![](media/image592.wmf)
after the end of the last symbol of

\- the last symbol of aperiodic CSI-RS resource for channel
measurements, and

\- the last symbol of aperiodic CSI-IM used for interference
measurements, and

\- the last symbol of aperiodic NZP CSI-RS for interference
measurements, when aperiodic CSI-RS is used for channel measurement for
triggered CSI report ![](media/image593.wmf)

the UE is not required to update the CSI report for the triggered CSI
report ![](media/image594.wmf)*.* ![](media/image595.wmf)is defined in
\[6, TS 38.214\] and ![](media/image542.wmf) corresponds to the smallest
SCS configuration among the SCS configurations of the PDCCHs scheduling
the PUSCHs, the smallest SCS configuration of aperiodic CSI-RSs
associated with DCI formats provided by the PDCCHs triggering the
aperiodic CSI reports, and the smallest SCS configuration of the
overlapping PUCCHs and PUSCHs and ![](media/image596.wmf) for
![](media/image597.wmf), ![](media/image598.wmf) for
![](media/image599.wmf) and ![](media/image600.wmf) for
![](media/image601.wmf).

If a UE would transmit multiple PUCCHs in a slot that include HARQ-ACK
information, and/or SR, and/or CSI reports and any PUCCH with HARQ-ACK
information in the slot satisfies the above timing conditions and does
not overlap with any other PUCCH or PUSCH in the slot that does not
satisfy the above timing conditions, the UE multiplexes the HARQ-ACK
information, and/or SR, and/or CSI reports and determines corresponding
PUCCH(s) for transmission in the slot according to the following
pseudo-code. If the multiple PUCCHs do not include HARQ-ACK information
and do not overlap with any PUSCH transmission by the UE in response to
a DCI format detection by the UE, the timing conditions do not apply.

If

\- a UE is not provided *multi-CSI-PUCCH-ResourceList*, and

\- a resource for a PUCCH transmission with HARQ-ACK information in

with a SR occasion overlap in time with two resources for respective
PUCCH transmissions with two CSI reports, and

\- there is no resource for a PUCCH transmission with HARQ-ACK
information in response to a DCI format detection that overlaps in time
with any of the previous resources, and

\- the following pseudo code results to the UE attempting to determine a
single PUCCH resource from the HARQ-ACK and/or the SR resource and the
two PUCCH resources with CSI reports

the UE

\- multiplexes the HARQ-ACK information and/or the SR in the resource
for the PUCCH transmission with the CSI report having the higher
priority, and

priority

![](media/image604.wmf) if they overlap with any resource from the
resources for transmission of HARQ-ACK information

\- if the UE is not provided *simultaneousHARQ-ACK-CSI* and at least one
of the resources for transmission of HARQ-ACK information includes PUCCH

For each PUCCH resource in the set ![](media/image604.wmf) that
satisfies the aforementioned timing conditions, when applicable,

\- the UE transmits a PUCCH using the PUCCH resource if the PUCCH
resource does not overlap in time with a PUSCH transmission after
multiplexing UCI following the procedures described in clauses 9.2.5.1
and 9.2.5.2

\- the UE multiplexes HARQ-ACK information and/or CSI reports in a PUSCH
if the PUCCH resource overlaps in time with a PUSCH transmission, as
described in clause 9.3, and does not transmit SR. In case the PUCCH
resource overlaps in time with multiple PUSCH transmissions, the PUSCH
for multiplexing HARQ-ACK information and/or CSI is selected as
described in clause 9. If the PUSCH transmission by the UE is not in
response to a DCI format detection and the UE multiplexes only CSI
reports, the timing conditions are not applicable

\- the UE does not expect the resource to overlap with a second resource
of a PUCCH transmission over multiple slots if the resource is obtained
from a group of resources that do not overlap with the second resource.

clauses 9.2.5.0, 9.2.5.1 and 9.2.5.2 assume the following

\- resources for transmissions of UCI types, prior to multiplexing or
dropping, overlap in a slot

\- multiplexing conditions of corresponding UCI types in a single PUCCH
are satisfied, and

\- the UE does not transmit any PUSCH time-overlapping with PUCCH in the
slot.

#### 9.2.5.0 UE procedure for prioritization between SL HARQ-ACK information in a PUCCH and DL HARQ-ACK or SR or CSI in a PUCCH

The priority value of a PUCCH transmission is as described in clause
16.2.4.3.1.

For prioritization between SL HARQ-ACK information in a first PUCCH and
DL HARQ-ACK or SR or CSI in a second PUCCH

\- if the second PUCCH has priority index 1,

\- if *sl-PriorityThreshold-UL-URLLC* is provided

\- the UE transmits the first PUCCH if a smallest priority value of the
first PUCCH is smaller than *sl-PriorityThreshold-UL-URLLC;* otherwise,
the UE transmits the second PUCCH

\- else

\- the UE transmits the second PUCCH

\- else

\- the UE transmits the first PUCCH if the smallest priority value of
the first PUCCH is smaller than *sl-PriorityThreshold;* otherwise, the
UE transmits the second PUCCH

When the UE determines to transmit the second PUCCH, the UE determines a
single resource for multiplexing UCI in the second PUCCH as described in
clauses 9.2.5.1 and 9.2.5.2.

#### 9.2.5.1 UE procedure for multiplexing HARQ-ACK or CSI and SR in a PUCCH

In the following, a UE is configured to transmit $K$ PUCCHs for
respective $K$ SRs in a slot, as determined by a set of
*schedulingRequestResourceId*, a *schedulingRequestResourceId associated
with* *schedulingRequestID-BFR-SCell*, and a
*schedulingRequestResourceId associated with*
*schedulingRequestID-LBT-SCell*, with SR transmission occasions that
would overlap with a transmission of a PUCCH with HARQ-ACK information
from the UE in the slot or with a transmission of a PUCCH with CSI
report(s) from the UE in the slot.

If a UE would transmit a PUCCH with positive SR and at most two HARQ-ACK
information bits in a resource using PUCCH format 0, the UE transmits
the PUCCH in the resource using PUCCH format 0 in PRB(s) for HARQ-ACK
information as described in clause 9.2.3. The UE determines a value of
![](media/image637.wmf) and ![](media/image638.wmf) for computing a
value of cyclic shift ![](media/image557.wmf) \[4, TS 38.211\] where
![](media/image637.wmf) is provided by *initialCyclicShift* of
*PUCCH-format0*, and ![](media/image638.wmf) is determined from the
value of one HARQ-ACK information bit or from the values of two HARQ-ACK
information bits as in Table 9.2.5-1 and Table 9.2.5-2, respectively.

If the UE would transmit negative SR and a PUCCH with at most two
HARQ-ACK information bits in a resource using PUCCH format 0, the UE
transmits the PUCCH in the resource using PUCCH format 0 for HARQ-ACK
information as described in clause 9.2.3.

Table 9.2.5-1: Mapping of values for one HARQ-ACK information bit and
positive SR to sequences for PUCCH format 0

  --------------------------- ------------------------- -------------------------
  HARQ-ACK Value              0                         1
  **Sequence cyclic shift**   ![](media/image561.wmf)   ![](media/image563.wmf)
  --------------------------- ------------------------- -------------------------

Table 9.2.5-2: Mapping of values for two HARQ-ACK information bits and
positive SR to sequences for PUCCH format 0

  --------------------------- ------------------------- ------------------------- ------------------------- -------------------------
  HARQ-ACK Value              {0, 0}                    {0, 1}                    {1, 1}                    {1, 0}
  **Sequence cyclic shift**   ![](media/image639.wmf)   ![](media/image640.wmf)   ![](media/image641.wmf)   ![](media/image642.wmf)
  --------------------------- ------------------------- ------------------------- ------------------------- -------------------------

If a UE would transmit SR in a resource using PUCCH format 0 and
HARQ-ACK information bits in a resource using PUCCH format 1 in a slot,
the UE transmits only a PUCCH with the HARQ-ACK information bits in the
resource using PUCCH format 1.

If the UE would transmit positive SR in a first resource using PUCCH
format 1 and at most two HARQ-ACK information bits in a second resource
using PUCCH format 1 in a slot, the UE transmits a PUCCH with HARQ-ACK
information bits in the first resource using PUCCH format 1 as described
in clause 9.2.3. If a UE would not transmit a positive SR in a resource
using PUCCH format 1 and would transmit at most two HARQ-ACK information
bits in a resource using PUCCH format 1 in a slot, the UE transmits a
PUCCH in the resource using PUCCH format 1 for HARQ-ACK information as
described in clause 9.2.3.

If a UE would transmit a PUCCH with ![](media/image643.wmf) HARQ-ACK
information bits in a resource using PUCCH format 2 or PUCCH format 3 or
PUCCH format 4 in a slot, as described in clauses 9.2.1 and 9.2.3,
![](media/image644.wmf) bits representing a negative or positive SR, in
ascending order of the values of *schedulingRequestResourceId*, a
*schedulingRequestResourceId associated with
schedulingRequestID-BFR-SCell*, and a *schedulingRequestResourceId
associated with* *schedulingRequestID-LBT-SCell*, are appended to the
HARQ-ACK information bits and the UE transmits the combined
![](media/image645.wmf) UCI bits in a PUCCH using a resource with PUCCH
format 2 or PUCCH format 3 or PUCCH format 4 that the UE determines as
described in clauses 9.2.1 and 9.2.3. If one of the SRs is a positive
LRR, the value of the bits indicates the positive LRR. An all-zero value
for the ![](media/image646.wmf) bits represents a negative SR value
across all $K$ SRs.

If a UE would transmit a PUCCH with ![](media/image647.wmf) CSI report
bits in a resource using PUCCH format 2 or PUCCH format 3 or PUCCH
format 4 in a slot, ![](media/image646.wmf) bits representing
corresponding negative or positive SR, in ascending order of the values
of *schedulingRequestResourceId*, a *schedulingRequestResourceId
associated with schedulingRequestID-BFR-SCell*, and a
*schedulingRequestResourceId associated with*
*schedulingRequestID-LBT-SCell*, are prepended to the CSI information
bits as described in clause 9.2.5.2 and the UE transmits a PUCCH with
the combined ![](media/image648.wmf) UCI bits in a resource using the
PUCCH format 2 or PUCCH format 3 or PUCCH format 4 for CSI reporting. If
one of the SRs is a positive LRR, the value of the bits indicates the
positive LRR. An all-zero value for the ![](media/image646.wmf) bits
represents a negative SR value across all $K$ SRs.

If a UE transmits a PUCCH with ![](media/image486.wmf) HARQ-ACK
information bits, ![](media/image649.wmf) SR bits, and
![](media/image564.wmf) CRC bits using PUCCH format 2 or PUCCH format 3
in a PUCCH resource that includes ![](media/image565.wmf) PRBs, the UE
determines a number of PRBs ![](media/image650.wmf) for the PUCCH
transmission to be the minimum number of PRBs, that is smaller than or
equal to a number of PRBs provided respectively by *nrofPRBs* in
*PUCCH-format2* or *nrofPRBs* in *PUCCH-format3* and starts from the
first PRB from the number of PRBs, that results to
![](media/image651.wmf) and, if ![](media/image568.wmf),
![](media/image652.wmf), where ![](media/image570.wmf),
![](media/image653.wmf), ![](media/image572.wmf), and
![](media/image573.wmf) are defined in clause 9.2.5.2. For PUCCH format
3, if ![](media/image654.wmf) is not equal ![](media/image655.wmf)
according to \[4, TS 38.211\], ![](media/image576.wmf) is increased to
the nearest allowed value of *nrofPRBs* for *PUCCH-format3* \[12, TS
38.331\]. If ![](media/image656.wmf), the UE transmits the PUCCH over
the ![](media/image657.wmf) PRBs.

If a UE is provided a first interlace of
$M_{\text{Interlace,0}}^{\text{PUCCH}}$ PRBs by *interlace0* in
*InterlaceAllocation* and transmits a PUCCH with $O_{\text{ACK}}$
HARQ-ACK information bits,
$O_{\text{SR}} = \left\lceil \log_{2}\left( K + 1 \right) \right\rceil$
SR bits, and $O_{\text{CRC}}$ CRC bits using PUCCH format 2 or PUCCH
format 3, the UE transmits the PUCCH over the first interlace if
$\left( O_{\text{ACK}} + O_{\text{SR}} + O_{\text{CRC}} \right) \leq M_{\text{Interlace,0}}^{\text{PUCCH}} \cdot N_{\text{sc,ctrl}}^{\text{RB}} \cdot N_{\text{symb-UCI}}^{\text{PUCCH}} \cdot Q_{m} \cdot r$;
otherwise, if the UE is provided a second interlace by *interlace1* in
*PUCCH-format2* or *PUCCH-format3*, the UE transmits the PUCCH over the
first and second interlaces.

#### 9.2.5.2 UE procedure for multiplexing HARQ-ACK/SR/CSI in a PUCCH

For a transmission occasion of a single CSI report, a PUCCH resource is
provided by *pucch-CSI-ResourceList*. For a transmission occasion of
multiple CSI reports, corresponding PUCCH resources can be provided by
*multi-CSI-PUCCH-ResourceList*. If a UE is provided first and second
*PUCCH-Config*, *multi-CSI-PUCCH-ResourceList* is provided by the
first *PUCCH-Config*, and *PUCCH-ResourceId* in *pucch-CSI-ResourceList*
or *multi-CSI-PUCCH-ResourceList* indicates a corresponding PUCCH
resource in *PUCCH-Resource* provided by the first *PUCCH-Config*.

If a UE is provided only one PUCCH resource set for transmission of
HARQ-ACK information in response to PDSCH reception scheduled by a DCI
format or in response to a SPS PDSCH release or in response to a SCell
dormancy indication, the UE does not expect to be provided
*simultaneousHARQ-ACK-CSI*.

A UE is configured by *maxCodeRate* a code rate for multiplexing
HARQ-ACK, SR, and CSI report(s) in a PUCCH transmission using PUCCH
format 2, PUCCH format 3, or PUCCH format 4.

If a UE transmits CSI reports using PUCCH format 2, the UE transmits
only wideband CSI for each CSI report \[6, TS 38.214\]. In the
following, a Part 1 CSI report refers either to a CSI report with only
wideband CSI or to a Part 1 CSI report with wideband CSI and sub-band
CSI.

Denote as

\- ![](media/image486.wmf) a total number of HARQ-ACK information bits,
if any

\- ![](media/image658.wmf) a total number of SR bits.

otherwise, ![](media/image649.wmf) as described in clause 9.2.5.1

\- ![](media/image660.wmf), where ![](media/image661.wmf) is a number of
Part 1 CSI report bits for CSI report with priority value
![](media/image662.wmf), ![](media/image663.wmf) is a number of Part 2
CSI report bits, if any, for CSI report with priority value
![](media/image662.wmf) \[6, TS 38.214\], and ![](media/image664.wmf) is
a number of CSI reports that include overlapping CSI reports

\- ![](media/image665.wmf), where ![](media/image666.wmf) is a number of
CRC bits, if any, for encoding HARQ-ACK, SR and Part 1 CSI report bits
and ![](media/image667.wmf) is a number of CRC bits, if any, for
encoding Part 2 CSI report bits

In the following

Table 9.2.5.2-1.

\- ![](media/image668.wmf) is a number of PRBs for *PUCCH format 2, or
PUCCH format 3, or PUCCH format 4,* respectively, where
![](media/image668.wmf) is provided by *nrofPRBs* in *PUCCH-format2* for
PUCCH format 2 or by *nrofPRBs* in *PUCCH-format3* for PUCCH format 3,
and ![](media/image669.wmf) for PUCCH format 4

\- ![](media/image670.wmf) for PUCCH format 2 or, if the PUCCH resource
with PUCCH format 2 includes an orthogonal cover code with length
![](media/image671.wmf) provided by *occ-Length*,
![](media/image672.wmf), ![](media/image673.wmf) for PUCCH format 3 or,
if the PUCCH resource with PUCCH format 3 includes an orthogonal cover
code with length ![](media/image674.wmf) provided by *occ-Length*,
![](media/image675.wmf), and ![](media/image676.wmf) for PUCCH format 4,
where ![](media/image677.wmf) is a number of subcarriers per resource
block \[4, TS 38.211\]

\- ![](media/image678.wmf) is equal to a number of PUCCH symbols
![](media/image679.wmf) for *PUCCH format 2* provided by *nrofSymbols*
in *PUCCH-format2. For PUCCH format 3 or for PUCCH format 4,*
![](media/image678.wmf) *is equal to a number of PUCCH symbols*
![](media/image680.wmf) f*or PUCCH format 3 or equal to a number of
PUCCH symbols* ![](media/image681.wmf) f*or PUCCH format 4* provided by
*nrofSymbols* in *PUCCH-format3* or *nrofSymbols* in *PUCCH-format4*,
respectively, after excluding a number of symbols used for DM-RS
transmission for PUCCH format 3 or for PUCCH format 4, respectively \[4,
TS 38.211\]

\- ![](media/image682.wmf) if pi/2-BPSK is the modulation scheme and
![](media/image683.wmf) if QPSK is the modulation scheme as indicated by
*pi2BPSK* for PUCCH format 3 or PUCCH format 4. For PUCCH format 2,
![](media/image684.wmf)

If a UE has one or more CSI reports and zero or more HARQ-ACK/SR
information bits to transmit in a PUCCH where the HARQ-ACK, if any, is
in response to a PDSCH reception without a corresponding PDCCH

\- if any of the CSI reports are overlapping and the UE is provided by
*multi-CSI-PUCCH-ResourceList* with ![](media/image685.wmf) PUCCH
resources in a slot, for PUCCH format 2 and/or PUCCH format 3 and/or

indexed according to an ascending order for the product of a number of
corresponding REs, modulation order ![](media/image686.wmf), and
configured code rate ![](media/image573.wmf);

![](media/image688.wmf), or the PUCCH format 3 resource
![](media/image689.wmf), or the PUCCH format 4 resource
![](media/image690.wmf)

\- else if ![](media/image691.wmf) and ![](media/image692.wmf),
![](media/image693.wmf), the UE transmits a PUCCH conveying HARQ-ACK
information, SR and CSI report(s) in a respective PUCCH where the UE
uses the PUCCH format 2 resource ![](media/image694.wmf), or the PUCCH
format 3 resource ![](media/image694.wmf), or the PUCCH format 4

![](media/image696.wmf) CSI report(s) for transmission together with
HARQ-ACK information and SR, when any, in ascending priority value as
described in \[6, TS 38.214\]

\- else, the UE transmits the ![](media/image697.wmf) bits in a PUCCH
resource provided by *pucch-CSI-ResourceList* and determined as
described in clause 9.2.5

If a UE has HARQ-ACK, SR and wideband or sub-band CSI reports to
transmit and the UE determines a PUCCH resource with PUCCH format 2, or
the UE has HARQ-ACK, SR and wideband CSI reports \[6, TS 38.214\] to

from the ![](media/image713.wmf) PRBs satisfying ![](media/image714.wmf)

\- if for ![](media/image715.wmf) Part 2 CSI report priority value(s),
it is

![](media/image716.wmf) and

according to respective priority value(s) \[6, TS 38.214\], for
transmission together with the HARQ-ACK, SR and ![](media/image664.wmf)
Part 1 CSI reports , where ![](media/image719.wmf) is the number of Part
1 CSI report bits for the ![](media/image720.wmf) CSI report and
![](media/image721.wmf) is the number of Part 2 CSI report bits for the
![](media/image720.wmf) CSI report priority value,
![](media/image722.wmf) is a number of CRC bits corresponding to
![](media/image723.wmf), and ![](media/image724.wmf) is a number of CRC
bits corresponding to ![](media/image725.wmf)

\- else, the UE drops all Part 2 CSI reports and selects
![](media/image726.wmf) Part 1 CSI report(s), from the
![](media/image664.wmf) CSI reports in ascending priority value \[6, TS
38.214\], for transmission together with the HARQ-ACK and SR information
bits where the value of ![](media/image727.wmf) satisfies
![](media/image728.wmf) and ![](media/image729.wmf), where
![](media/image730.wmf)is a number of CRC bits corresponding to
![](media/image731.wmf) UCI bits, and ![](media/image732.wmf) is a
number of CRC bits corresponding to ![](media/image733.wmf) UCI bits.

If a UE is provided a first interlace of
$M_{\text{Interlace,0}}^{\text{PUCCH}}$ PRBs by *interlace0* in
*InterlaceAllocation*, the UE has HARQ-ACK, SR and sub-band CSI reports
to transmit, and the UE determines a PUCCH resource with PUCCH format 3,
where

\- the UE determines the PUCCH resource using the PUCCH resource
indicator field in a last of a number of DCI formats, excluding the SPS
activation DCI, that have a value of a PDSCH-to-HARQ\_feedback timing
indicator field indicating a same slot for the PUCCH transmission, or a
value provided by *dl-DataToUL-ACK* or *dl-DataToUL-ACK-r16* or
*dl-DataToUL-ACK-DCI-1-2* if the PDSCH-to-HARQ\_feedback timing
indicator field is not present in the last DCI format, from a PUCCH
resource set provided to the UE for HARQ-ACK transmission, and

\- the UE determines the PUCCH resource set as described in clauses
9.2.1 and 9.2.3 for $O_{\text{UCI}}$ UCI bits

and

\- if
$\left( O_{\text{ACK}} + O_{\text{SR}} + O_{\text{CSI}} + O_{\text{CRC}} \right) \leq M_{\text{Interlace,0}}^{\text{PUCCH}} \cdot N_{\text{sc,ctrl}}^{\text{RB}} \cdot N_{\text{symb-UCI}}^{\text{PUCCH}} \cdot Q_{m} \cdot r$,

$N_{\text{CSI}}^{\text{total}}$ CSI report bits in a PUCCH over the
first interlace

\- else if the UE is provided a second interlace of
$M_{\text{Interlace,1}}^{\text{PUCCH}}$ PRBs by *interlace1* and if
$\left( O_{\text{ACK}} + O_{\text{SR}} + O_{\text{CSI}} + O_{\text{CRC}} \right) \leq \left( M_{\text{Interlace,0}}^{\text{PUCCH}} + M_{\text{Interlace,1}}^{\text{PUCCH}} \right) \cdot N_{\text{sc,ctrl}}^{\text{RB}} \cdot N_{\text{symb-UCI}}^{\text{PUCCH}} \cdot Q_{m} \cdot r$,

with $M_{\text{Interlace,0}}^{\text{PUCCH}}$, or, if the UE is provided
*interlace1*, with

### 9.2.6 PUCCH repetition procedure

For PUCCH formats 1, 3, or 4, a UE can be configured a number of slots,
$N_{\text{PUCCH}}^{\text{repeat}}$, for repetitions of a PUCCH
transmission by respective *nrofSlots*. If a UE is provided
a *PUCCH-config* that includes *subslotLengthForPUCCH,* the UE does not
expect the *PUCCH-config* to include *nrofSlots*.

For $N_{\text{PUCCH}}^{\text{repeat}} > 1$,

\- the UE repeats the PUCCH transmission with the UCI over
$N_{\text{PUCCH}}^{\text{repeat}}$ slots

\- a PUCCH transmission in each of the
$N_{\text{PUCCH}}^{\text{repeat}}$ slots has a same number of
consecutive symbols, as provided by *nrofSymbols* in *PUCCH-format1*,
*nrofSymbols* in *PUCCH-format3*, or *nrofSymbols* in *PUCCH-format4*

\- a PUCCH transmission in each of the
$N_{\text{PUCCH}}^{\text{repeat}}$ slots has a same first symbol, as
provided by *startingSymbolIndex* in *PUCCH-format1*,
*startingSymbolIndex* in *PUCCH-format3*, or *startingSymbolIndex* in
*PUCCH-format4*

\- the UE is configured by *interslotFrequencyHopping* whether or not to
perform frequency hopping for PUCCH transmissions in different slots

\- if the UE is configured to perform frequency hopping for PUCCH
transmissions across different slots

\- the UE performs frequency hopping per slot

\- the UE transmits the PUCCH starting from a first PRB, provided by
*startingPRB*, in slots with even number and starting from the second
PRB, provided by *secondHopPRB*, in slots with odd number. The slot
indicated to the UE for the first PUCCH transmission has number 0 and
each subsequent slot until the UE transmits the PUCCH in
$N_{\text{PUCCH}}^{\text{repeat}}$ slots is counted regardless of
whether or not the UE transmits the PUCCH in the slot

\- the UE does not expect to be configured to perform frequency hopping
for a PUCCH transmission within a slot

\- If the UE is not configured to perform frequency hopping for PUCCH
transmissions across different slots and if the UE is configured to
perform frequency hopping for a PUCCH transmission within a slot, the
frequency hopping pattern between the first PRB and the second PRB is
same within each slot

If the UE determines that, for a PUCCH transmission in a slot, the
number of symbols available for the PUCCH transmission is smaller than
the value provided by *nrofSymbols* for the corresponding PUCCH format,
the UE does not transmit the PUCCH in the slot.

A SS/PBCH block symbol is a symbol of an SS/PBCH block with candidate
SS/PBCH block index corresponding to the SS/PBCH block index indicated
to a UE by *ssb-PositionsInBurst* in *SIB1* or *ssb-PositionsInBurst* in
*ServingCellConfigCommon, as described in clause 4.1*.

For unpaired spectrum, the UE determines the
$N_{\text{PUCCH}}^{\text{repeat}}$ slots for a PUCCH transmission
starting from a slot indicated to the UE as described in clause 9.2.3
for HARQ-ACK reporting, or a slot determined as described in clause
9.2.4 for SR reporting or in clause 5.2.1.4 of \[6, TS 38.214\] for CSI
reporting and having

\- an UL symbol, as described in clause 11.1, or flexible symbol that is
not SS/PBCH block symbol provided by *startingSymbolIndex* in
*PUCCH-format1*, or in *PUCCH-format3*, or in *PUCCH-format4* as a first
symbol, and

\- consecutive UL symbols, as described in clause 11.1, or flexible
symbols that are not SS/PBCH block symbols, starting from the first
symbol, equal to or larger than a number of symbols provided by
*nrofsymbols* in *PUCCH-format1*, or in *PUCCH-format3*, or in
*PUCCH-format4*

For paired spectrum or supplementary uplink band, the UE determines the
$N_{\text{PUCCH}}^{\text{repeat}}$ slots for a PUCCH transmission as the
$N_{\text{PUCCH}}^{\text{repeat}}$ consecutive slots starting from a
slot indicated to the UE as described in clause 9.2.3 for HARQ-ACK
reporting, or a slot determined as described in clause 9.2.4 for SR
reporting or in clause 5.2.1.4 of \[6, TS 38.214\] for CSI reporting.

If a UE would transmit a PUCCH over a first number
$N_{\text{PUCCH}}^{\text{repeat}} > 1$ of slots and the UE would
transmit a PUSCH with repetition Type A over a second number of slots,
and the PUCCH transmission would overlap with the PUSCH transmission in
one or more slots, and the conditions in clause 9.2.5 for multiplexing
the UCI in the PUSCH are satisfied in the overlapping slots, the UE
transmits the PUCCH and does not transmit the PUSCH in the overlapping
slots.

If a UE would transmit a PUCCH over a first number
$N_{\text{PUCCH}}^{\text{repeat}} > 1$ of slots and the UE would
transmit a PUSCH with repetition Type B over a second number of slots,
and the PUCCH transmission would overlap with actual PUSCH repetitions
in one or more slots, and the conditions in clause 9.2.5 for
multiplexing the UCI in the PUSCH are satisfied for the overlapping
actual PUSCH repetitions, the UE transmits the PUCCH and does not
transmit the overlapping actual PUSCH repetitions.

A UE does not multiplex different UCI types in a PUCCH transmission with
repetitions over $N_{\text{PUCCH}}^{\text{repeat}} > 1$ slots. If a UE
would transmit a first PUCCH over more than one slot and at least a
second PUCCH over one or more slots, and the transmissions of the first
PUCCH and the second PUCCH would overlap in a number of slots then, for
each slot of the number of slots and with UCI type priority of HARQ-ACK
\> SR \> CSI with higher priority \> CSI with lower priority, the UE
determines an earliest first PUCCH in a slot with the order of earliest
starting symbol followed by longest duration and the second PUCCHs
overlapping with the earliest first PUCCH, and then performs the
following

\- the UE does not expect more than one PUCCH from the first PUCCH and
the second PUCCHs to start at a same slot and include a UCI type with
same priority

\- if more than one PUCCH from the first PUCCH and the second PUCCHs
include a UCI type with the same highest priority, the UE transmits the
PUCCH with the highest priority starting at an earliest slot and does
not transmit the other PUCCHs, otherwise,

\- the UE transmits the PUCCH that includes the UCI type with the
highest priority and does not transmit the PUCCHs that include the UCI
type with lower priority

The UE repeats the above procedure until there is no PUCCH overlapping
with any PUCCH with repetitions in the slot.

A UE does not expect a PUCCH that is in response to a DCI format
detection to overlap with any other PUCCH that does not satisfy the
corresponding timing conditions in clause 9.2.5.

If a UE would transmit a PUCCH over $N_{\text{PUCCH}}^{\text{repeat}}$
slots and the UE does not transmit the PUCCH in a slot from the
$N_{\text{PUCCH}}^{\text{repeat}}$ slots due to overlapping with another
PUCCH transmission in the slot, the UE counts the slot in the number of
$N_{\text{PUCCH}}^{\text{repeat}}$ slots.

For DAPS operation, if a UE would transmit a PUCCH over
$N_{\text{PUCCH}}^{\text{repeat}}$ slots on the source MCG and the UE
does not transmit the PUCCH in a slot from the
$N_{\text{PUCCH}}^{\text{repeat}}$ slots due to overlapping in time with
UE transmission on the target MCG in the slot, the UE counts the slot in
the number of $N_{\text{PUCCH}}^{\text{repeat}}$ slots.

9.3 UCI reporting in physical uplink shared channel
---------------------------------------------------

Offset values are defined for a UE to determine a number of resources
for multiplexing HARQ-ACK information and for multiplexing CSI reports
in a PUSCH. Offset values are also defined for multiplexing CG-UCI \[5,
TS 38.212\] in a CG-PUSCH. The offset values are signalled to a UE
either by a DCI format scheduling the PUSCH transmission or by higher
layers.

If a DCI format that does not include a beta\_offset indicator field
schedules the PUSCH transmission from the UE and the UE is provided
*betaOffsets = \'semiStatic\' or betaOffsetsDCI-0-2 =
\'semiStaticDCI-0-2\'*, the UE applies the ![](media/image734.wmf),
![](media/image735.wmf), and ![](media/image736.wmf) values that are
provided by *betaOffsets = \'semiStatic\'* for DCI formats 0\_0/0\_1 or
by *betaOffsetsDCI-0-2 = \'semiStaticDCI-0-2\'* for DCI format 0\_2 for
the corresponding HARQ-ACK information, Part 1 CSI reports and Part 2
CSI reports.

If the PUSCH transmission is with a configured grant and the UE is
provided *CG-UCI-OnPUSCH= \'semiStatic\'*, the UE applies the
![](media/image734.wmf), ![](media/image735.wmf), and
![](media/image736.wmf) values that are provided by *CG-UCI-OnPUSCH =
\'semiStatic\'* for the corresponding HARQ-ACK information, Part 1 CSI
reports and Part 2 CSI reports.

If the PUSCH is scheduled by DCI format 0\_0 and the UE is provided
*betaOffsets = \'dynamic\'*, the UE applies the ![](media/image737.wmf),
![](media/image738.wmf), and ![](media/image739.wmf) values that are
determined from the first value of  *betaOffsets = \'dynamic\'*.

If the PUSCH is a configured grant Type 2 PUSCH activated by DCI format
0\_0 and the UE is provided *CG-UCI-OnPUSCH* =*\'dynamic\'*, the UE
applies the ![](media/image737.wmf), ![](media/image738.wmf), and
![](media/image739.wmf) values that are determined from the first value
of *CG-UCI-OnPUSCH = \'dynamic\'*.

HARQ-ACK information offsets ![](media/image734.wmf) are configured to
values according to Table 9.3-1. The *betaOffsetACK-Index1*,
*betaOffsetACK-Index2*, and *betaOffsetACK-Index3* respectively provide
indexes ![](media/image740.wmf), ![](media/image741.wmf), and
![](media/image742.wmf) for the UE to use if the UE multiplexes up to 2
HARQ-ACK information bits, more than 2 and up to 11 HARQ-ACK information
bits, and more than 11 bits in the PUSCH, respectively.

Part 1 CSI report and Part 2 CSI report offsets ![](media/image735.wmf)
and ![](media/image736.wmf), respectively, are configured to values
according to Table 9.3-2. The *betaOffsetCSI-Part1-Index1* and
*betaOffsetCSI-Part2-Index1* respectively provide indexes
![](media/image743.wmf) and ![](media/image744.wmf) for the UE to use if
the UE multiplexes up to 11 bits for Part 1 CSI reports or Part 2 CSI
reports in the PUSCH. The *betaOffsetCSI-Part1-Index2* and
*betaOffsetCSI-Part2-Index2* respectively provide indexes
![](media/image745.wmf) or ![](media/image746.wmf) for the UE to use if
the UE multiplexes more than 11 bits for Part 1 CSI reports or Part 2
CSI reports in the PUSCH.

If a DCI format that includes a beta\_offset indicator field with one
bit or two bits, as configured by *UCI-OnPUSCH* for DCI format 0\_1 or
by *UCI-OnPUSCH-DCI-0-2* for DCI format 0\_2, schedules the PUSCH
transmission from the UE, the UE is provided by each of
{*betaOffsetACK-Index1*, *betaOffsetACK-Index2*, *betaOffsetACK-Index3*}
a set of two or four ![](media/image747.wmf) indexes, by each of
{*betaOffsetCSI-Part1-Index1*, *betaOffsetCSI-Part1-Index2*} a set of
two or four ![](media/image748.wmf) indexes, and by each of
{*betaOffsetCSI-Part2-Index1*, *betaOffsetCSI-Part2-Index2*} a set of
two or four ![](media/image749.wmf) indexes from Tables 9.3-1 and 9.3-2,
respectively, for multiplexing HARQ-ACK information, Part 1 CSI reports,
and Part 2 CSI reports, respectively, in the PUSCH transmission. The
beta\_offset indicator field indicates a ![](media/image750.wmf) value,
a ![](media/image748.wmf) value and a ![](media/image749.wmf) value from
the respective sets of values, with the mapping defined in Table 9.3-3
and in Table 9.3-3A.

For a PUSCH transmission that is configured by a
*ConfiguredGrantConfig*, and includes CG-UCI, the UE multiplexes CG-UCI
in the PUSCH transmission if the UE is provided by *betaOffsetCG-UCI* a
$I_{\text{offset}}^{\text{CG-UCI}}$ value, from a set of values, with
the mapping defined in Table 9.3-1. If the UE multiplexes HARQ-ACK
information in the PUSCH transmission, as described in clause 9.2.5, the
UE jointly encodes the HARQ-ACK information and the CG-UCI \[5, TS
38.212\] and determines a number of resources for multiplexing the
combined information in a PUSCH using
$\beta_{\text{offset}}^{HARQ - ACK}$ which provides indexes
$I_{offset,1}^{HARQ - ACK}$ and $I_{offset,2}^{HARQ - ACK}$ for the UE
to use if the UE multiplexes up to 11, and more than 11 combined
information bits, respectively.

10 UE procedure for receiving control information
=================================================

If the UE is configured with a SCG, the UE shall apply the procedures
described in this clause for both MCG and SCG except for PDCCH
monitoring in Type0/0A/2-PDCCH CSS sets where the UE is not required to
apply the procedures in this clause for the SCG

\- When the procedures are applied for MCG, the terms \'secondary
cell\', \'secondary cells\' , \'serving cell\', \'serving cells\' in
this clause refer to secondary cell, secondary cells, serving cell,
serving cells belonging to the MCG respectively.

\- When the procedures are applied for SCG, the terms \'secondary
cell\', \'secondary cells\', \'serving cell\', \'serving cells\' in this
clause refer to secondary cell, secondary cells (not including PSCell),
serving cell, serving cells belonging to the SCG respectively. The term
\'primary cell\' in this clause refers to the PSCell of the SCG.

A UE monitors a set of PDCCH candidates in one or more CORESETs on the
active DL BWP on each activated serving cell configured with PDCCH
monitoring according to corresponding search space sets where monitoring
implies decoding each PDCCH candidate according to the monitored DCI
formats.

If a UE is provided *monitoringCapabilityConfig* for a serving cell, the
UE obtains an indication to monitor PDCCH on the serving cell for a
maximum number of PDCCH candidates and non-overlapping CCEs

\- per slot, as in Tables 10.1-2 and 10.1-3, if
*monitoringCapabilityConfig* = *r15monitoringcapability*, or

\- per span, as in Tables 10.1-2A and 10.1-3A, if
*monitoringCapabilityConfig* = *r16monitoringcapability*

If the UE is not provided *monitoringCapabilityConfig*, the UE monitors
PDCCH on the serving cell for a maximum number of PDCCH candidates and
non-overlapping CCEs per slot.

A UE can indicate a capability to monitor PDCCH according to one or more
of the combinations $\left( X,Y \right)$ = (2, 2), (4, 3), and (7, 3)
per SCS configuration of $\mu = 0$ and $\mu = 1$. A span is a number of
consecutive symbols in a slot where the UE is configured to monitor
PDCCH. Each PDCCH monitoring occasion is within one span. If a UE
monitors PDCCH on a cell according to combination $\left( X,Y \right)$,
the UE supports PDCCH monitoring occasions in any symbol of a slot with
minimum time separation of $X$ symbols between the first symbol of two
consecutive spans, including across slots. A span starts at a first
symbol where a PDCCH monitoring occasion starts and ends at a last
symbol where a PDCCH monitoring occasion ends, where the number of
symbols of the span is up to $Y$.

If a UE indicates a capability to monitor PDCCH according to multiple
$\left( X,Y \right)$ combinations and a configuration of search space
sets to the UE for PDCCH monitoring on a cell results to a separation of
every two consecutive PDCCH monitoring spans that is equal to or larger
than the value of $X$ for one or more of the multiple combinations
$\left( X,Y \right)$, the UE monitors PDCCH on the cell according to the
combination $\left( X,Y \right)$, from the one or more combinations
$\left( X,Y \right)$, that is associated with the largest maximum number
of $M_{\text{PDCCH}}^{max,\left( X,Y \right),\mu}$ and
$C_{\text{PDCCH}}^{max,\left( X,Y \right),\mu}$ defined in Table 10.1-2A
and Table 10.1-3A. The UE expects to monitor PDCCH according to the same
combination $\left( X,Y \right)$ in every slot on the active DL BWP of a
cell.

A UE capability for PDCCH monitoring per slot or per span on an active
DL BWP of a serving cell is defined by a maximum number of PDCCH
candidates and non-overlapped CCEs the UE can monitor per slot or per
span, respectively, on the active DL BWP of the serving cell.

For monitoring of a PDCCH candidate by a UE, if the UE

\- has received *ssb-PositionsInBurst* in *SIB1* and has not received
*ssb-PositionsInBurst* in *ServingCellConfigCommon* for a serving cell,
and

\- does not monitor PDCCH candidates in a Type0-PDCCH CSS set, and

\- at least one RE for a PDCCH candidate overlaps with at least one RE
of a candidate SS/PBCH block corresponding to a SS/PBCH block index
provided by *ssb-PositionsInBurst* in *SIB1*,

the UE is not required to monitor the PDCCH candidate.

For monitoring of a PDCCH candidate by a UE, if the UE

\- has received *ssb-PositionsInBurst* in *ServingCellConfigCommon* for
a serving cell, and

\- does not monitor PDCCH candidates in a Type0-PDCCH CSS set, and

\- at least one RE for a PDCCH candidate overlaps with at least one RE
of a candidate SS/PBCH block corresponding to a SS/PBCH block index
provided by *ssb-PositionsInBurst* in *ServingCellConfigCommon*,

the UE is not required to monitor the PDCCH candidate.

If a UE monitors the PDCCH candidate for a Type0-PDCCH CSS set on the
serving cell according to the procedure described in clause 13, the UE
may assume that no SS/PBCH block is transmitted in REs used for
monitoring the PDCCH candidate on the serving cell.

If *at least one RE of a PDCCH candidate for a UE on the serving cell
overlaps with at least one RE of lte-CRS-ToMatchAround*, *or* of
*LTE-CRS-PatternList*, *the UE is not required to monitor the PDCCH
candidate*.

If a UE is provided *availableRB-SetsPerCell,* the UE is not required to
monitor PDCCH candidates that overlap with any RB from RB sets that are
indicated as unavailable for receptions by an available RB set indicator
field in DCI format 2\_0 as described in clause 11.1.1. If the UE does
not obtain the available RB set indicator for a symbol, the UE monitors
PDCCH candidates on all RB sets in the symbol.

If a UE can support

\- a first set of $N_{\text{cells,0}}^{\text{DL}}$ serving cells where
the UE is either not provided *coresetPoolIndex* or is provided
*coresetPoolIndex* with a single value for all CORESETs on all DL BWPs
of each scheduling cell from the first set of serving cells, and

\- a second set of $N_{\text{cells,1}}^{\text{DL}}$ serving cells where
the UE is not provided *coresetPoolIndex* or is provided
*coresetPoolIndex* with a value 0 for a first CORESET, and with a value
1 for a second CORESET on any DL BWP of each scheduling cell from the
second set of serving cells

the UE determines, for the purpose of reporting
*pdcch-BlindDetectionCA*, a number of serving cells as
$N_{\text{cells,0}}^{\text{DL}} + R \cdot N_{\text{cells,1}}^{\text{DL}}$
where $R$ is a value reported by the UE.

If a UE indicates in *UE-NR-Capability* a carrier aggregation capability
larger than 4 serving cells and the UE is not provided
*monitoringCapabilityConfig* for any downlink cell or if the UE is
provided *monitoringCapabilityConfig* = *r15monitoringcapability* for
all downlink cells where the UE monitors PDCCH, the UE includes in
*UE-NR-Capability* an indication for a maximum number of PDCCH
candidates and for a maximum number of non-overlapped CCEs the UE can
monitor per slot when the UE is configured for carrier aggregation
operation over more than 4 cells. When a UE is not configured for NR-DC
operation, the UE determines a capability to monitor a maximum number of
PDCCH candidates and a maximum number of non-overlapped CCEs per slot
that corresponds to $N_{\text{cells}}^{\text{cap}}$ downlink cells,
where

\- $N_{\text{cells}}^{\text{cap}}$ is
$N_{\text{cells,0}}^{\text{DL}} + R \cdot N_{\text{cells,1}}^{\text{DL}}$
if the UE does not provide *pdcch-BlindDetectionCA* where
$N_{\text{cells,0}}^{\text{DL}} + N_{\text{cells,1}}^{\text{DL}}$ is the
number of configured downlink serving cells

\- otherwise, $N_{\text{cells}}^{\text{cap}}$ is the value of
*pdcch-BlindDetectionCA*

When a UE is configured for NR-DC operation, the UE determines a
capability to monitor a maximum number of PDCCH candidates and a maximum
number of non-overlapped CCEs per slot that corresponds to
$N_{\text{cells}}^{\text{cap}} = N_{\text{cells}}^{\text{MCG}}$ downlink
cells for the MCG where $N_{\text{cells}}^{\text{MCG}}$ is provided by
*pdcch-BlindDetection* for the MCG and determines a capability to
monitor a maximum number of PDCCH candidates and a maximum number of
non-overlapped CCEs per slot that corresponds to
$N_{\text{cells}}^{\text{cap}} = N_{\text{cells}}^{\text{SCG}}$ downlink
cells for the SCG where $N_{\text{cells}}^{\text{SCG}}$ is provided by
*pdcch-BlindDetection* for the SCG. When the UE is configured for
carrier aggregation operation over more than 4 cells, or for a cell
group when the UE is configured for NR-DC operation, the UE does not
expect to monitor per slot a number of PDCCH candidates or a number of
non-overlapped CCEs that is larger than the maximum number as derived
from the corresponding value of $N_{\text{cells}}^{\text{cap}}$.

When a UE is configured for NR-DC operation with a total of
$N_{NR - DC}^{DL,cells}$ downlink cells on both the MCG and the SCG, the
UE expects to be provided *pdcch-BlindDetection* for the MCG and

10.1 UE procedure for determining physical downlink control channel assignment 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A set of PDCCH candidates for a UE to monitor is defined in terms of
PDCCH search space sets. A search space set can be a CSS set or a USS
set. A UE monitors PDCCH candidates in one or more of the following
search spaces sets

\- a Type0-PDCCH CSS set configured by *pdcch-ConfigSIB1* in *MIB* or by
*searchSpaceSIB1 in PDCCH-ConfigCommon* or by *searchSpaceZero* *in
PDCCH-ConfigCommon* for a DCI format with CRC scrambled by a SI-RNTI on
the primary cell of the MCG

\- a Type0A-PDCCH CSS set configured by
*searchSpaceOtherSystemInformation* *in PDCCH-ConfigCommon* for a DCI
format with CRC scrambled by a SI-RNTI on the primary cell of the MCG

\- a Type1-PDCCH CSS set configured by *ra-SearchSpace* *in
PDCCH-ConfigCommon* for a DCI format with CRC scrambled by a RA-RNTI, a
MsgB-RNTI, or a TC-RNTI on the primary cell

\- a Type2-PDCCH CSS set configured by *pagingSearchSpace* *in
PDCCH-ConfigCommon* for a DCI format with CRC scrambled by a P-RNTI on
the primary cell of the MCG

\- a Type3-PDCCH CSS set configured by *SearchSpace* in *PDCCH-Config*
with *searchSpaceType* = *common* for DCI formats with CRC scrambled by
INT-RNTI, SFI-RNTI, TPC-PUSCH-RNTI, TPC-PUCCH-RNTI, TPC-SRS-RNTI, or
CI-RNTI and, only for the primary cell, C-RNTI, MCS-C-RNTI, CS-RNTI(s),
or PS-RNTI and

\- a USS set configured by *SearchSpace* in *PDCCH-Config* with
*searchSpaceType* = *ue-Specific* for DCI formats with CRC scrambled by
C-RNTI, MCS-C-RNTI, SP-CSI-RNTI, CS-RNTI(s), SL-RNTI, SL-CS-RNTI, or SL
Semi-Persistent Scheduling V-RNTI.

For a DL BWP, if a UE is not provided *searchSpaceSIB1* for Type0-PDCCH
CSS set by *PDCCH-ConfigCommon*, the UE does not monitor PDCCH
candidates for a Type0-PDCCH CSS set on the DL BWP. The Type0-PDCCH CSS
set is defined by the CCE aggregation levels and the number of PDCCH
candidates per CCE aggregation level given in Table 10.1-1. If the
active DL BWP and the initial DL BWP have same SCS and same CP length
and the active DL BWP includes all RBs of the CORESET with index 0, or
the active DL BWP is the initial DL BWP, the CORESET configured for
Type0-PDCCH CSS set has CORESET index 0 and the Type0-PDCCH CSS set has
search space set index 0.

For a DL BWP, if a UE is not provided
*searchSpaceOtherSystemInformation* for Type0A-PDCCH CSS set, the UE
does not monitor PDCCH for Type0A-PDCCH CSS set on the DL BWP. The CCE
aggregation levels and the number of PDCCH candidates per CCE
aggregation level for Type0A-PDCCH CSS set are given in Table 10.1-1.

For a DL BWP, if a UE is not provided *ra-SearchSpace* for Type1-PDCCH
CSS set, the UE does not monitor PDCCH for Type1-PDCCH CSS set on the DL
BWP*.* If the UE has not been provided a Type3-PDCCH CSS set or a USS
set and the UE has received a C-RNTI and has been provided a Type1-PDCCH
CSS set, the UE monitors PDCCH candidates for DCI format 0\_0 and DCI
format 1\_0 with CRC scrambled by the C-RNTI in the Type1-PDCCH CSS set.

If a UE is not provided *pagingSearchSpace* for Type2-PDCCH CSS set, the
UE does not monitor PDCCH for Type2-PDCCH CSS set on the DL BWP. The CCE
aggregation levels and the number of PDCCH candidates per CCE
aggregation level for Type2-PDCCH CSS set are given in Table 10.1-1.

If a UE is provided a zero value for *searchSpaceID in
PDCCH-ConfigCommon* *for* a Type0/0A/2-PDCCH CSS set, the UE determines
monitoring occasions for PDCCH candidates of the Type0/0A/2-PDCCH CSS
set as described in clause 13, and the UE is provided a C-RNTI, the UE
monitors PDCCH candidates only at monitoring occasions associated with a
SS/PBCH block, where the SS/PBCH block is determined by the most recent
of

\- a MAC CE activation command indicating a TCI state of the active BWP
that includes a CORESET with index 0, as described in \[6, TS 38.214\],
where the TCI-state includes a CSI-RS which is quasi-co-located with the
SS/PBCH block, or

\- a random access procedure that is not initiated by a PDCCH order that
triggers a contention-free random access procedure

If a UE monitors PDCCH candidates for DCI formats with CRC scrambled by
a C-RNTI and the UE is provided a non-zero value for *searchSpaceID in
PDCCH-ConfigCommon* *for* a Type0/0A/2-PDCCH CSS set, the UE determines
monitoring occasions for PDCCH candidates of the Type0/0A/2-PDCCH CSS
set based on the search space set associated with the value of
*searchSpaceID*.

The UE may assume that the DM-RS antenna port associated with PDCCH
receptions in the CORESET configured by *pdcch-ConfigSIB1* in *MIB, the
DM-RS antenna port associated with* corresponding PDSCH receptions, and
the corresponding SS/PBCH block are quasi co-located with respect to
average gain, quasi co-location \'typeA\' and \'typeD\' properties, when
applicable \[6, TS 38.214\], if the UE is not provided a TCI state
indicating quasi co-location information of the DM-RS antenna port for
PDCCH reception in the CORESET. The value for the DM-RS scrambling
sequence initialization is the cell ID. For operation without shared
spectrum channel access, a SCS is provided by *subCarrierSpacingCommon*
in *MIB*. For operation with shared spectrum channel access, a SCS is
same as the SCS of a corresponding SS/PBCH block.

For single cell operation or for operation with carrier aggregation in a
same frequency band, a UE does not expect to monitor a PDCCH in a
Type0/0A/2/3-PDCCH CSS set or in a USS set if a DM-RS for monitoring a
PDCCH in a Type1-PDCCH CSS set is not configured with same *qcl-Type*
set to \'typeD\' properties \[6, TS 38.214\] with a DM-RS for monitoring
the PDCCH in the Type0/0A/2/3-PDCCH CSS set or in the USS set, and if
the PDCCH or an associated PDSCH overlaps in at least one symbol with a
PDCCH the UE monitors in a Type1-PDCCH CSS set or with an associated
PDSCH.

If a UE is provided

\- one or more search space sets by corresponding one or more of
*searchSpaceZero, searchSpaceSIB1, searchSpaceOtherSystemInformation*,
*pagingSearchSpace*, *ra-SearchSpace*, and

\- a C-RNTI, an MCS-C-RNTI, or a CS-RNTI

the UE monitors PDCCH candidates for DCI format 0\_0 and DCI format 1\_0
with CRC scrambled by the C-RNTI, the MCS-C-RNTI, or the CS-RNTI in the
one or more search space sets in a slot where the UE monitors PDCCH
candidates for at least a DCI format 0\_0 or a DCI format 1\_0 with CRC
scrambled by SI-RNTI, RA-RNTI, MsgB-RNTI, or P-RNTI.

If a UE is provided

\- one or more search space sets by corresponding one or more of
*searchSpaceZero, searchSpaceSIB1, searchSpaceOtherSystemInformation*,
*pagingSearchSpace*, *ra-SearchSpace*, or a CSS set by *PDCCH-Config*,
and

\- a SI-RNTI, a P-RNTI, a RA-RNTI, a MsgB-RNTI, a SFI-RNTI, an INT-RNTI,
a TPC-PUSCH-RNTI, a TPC-PUCCH-RNTI, or a TPC-SRS-RNTI

then, for a RNTI from any of these RNTIs, the UE does not expect to
process information from more than one DCI format with CRC scrambled
with the RNTI per slot.

Table 10.1-1: CCE aggregation levels and maximum number of PDCCH
candidates per CCE aggregation level for CSS sets configured by
*searchSpaceSIB1*

For each DL BWP configured to a UE in a serving cell, the UE can be
provided by higher layer signalling with

\- $P \leq 3$ CORESETs if *coresetPoolIndex* is not provided, or if a
value of *coresetPoolIndex* is same for all CORESETs if

\- $P \leq 5$ CORESETs if *coresetPoolIndex* is not provided for a first
CORESET, or is provided and has a value 0 for a first CORESET, and is
provided and has a value 1 for a second CORESET

For each CORESET, the UE is provided the following by
*ControlResourceSet*:

\- a CORESET index $p$, by *controlResourceSetId or by
controlResourceSetId-v1610*, where

\- $0 < p < 12$ if *coresetPoolIndex* is not provided, or if a value of
*coresetPoolIndex* is same for all CORESETs if *coresetPoolIndex* is
provided;

\- $0 < p < 16$ if *coresetPoolIndex* is not provided for a first
CORESET, or is provided and has a value 0 for a first CORESET, and is
provided and has a value 1 for a second CORESET;

\- a DM-RS scrambling sequence initialization value by

co-locations provided by *TCI-State*, indicating quasi co-location
information of the DM-RS antenna port for PDCCH reception in a
respective CORESET;

\- an indication for a presence or absence of a transmission
configuration indication (TCI) field for a DCI format, other than DCI
format 1\_0, that schedules PDSCH receptions or indicates SPS PDSCH
release or indicates SCell dormancy or indicates a request for a Type-3
HARQ-ACK codebook report without scheduling PDSCH and is transmitted by
a PDCCH in CORESET $p$, by *tci-PresentInDCI* or *tci-PresentDCI-1-2*.

When *precoderGranularity* = *allContiguousRBs*, a UE does not expect

\- to be configured a set of resource blocks of a CORESET that includes
more than four sub-sets of resource blocks that are not contiguous in
frequency

\- any RE of a CORESET to overlap with any RE determined from
*lte-CRS-ToMatchAround*, *or* from *LTE-CRS-PatternList*, or with any RE
of a SS/PBCH block.

For each CORESET in a DL BWP of a serving cell, a respective
*frequencyDomainResources* provides a bitmap

\- if a CORESET is not associated with any search space set configured
with *freqMonitorLocations*, the bits of the bitmap have a one-to-one
mapping with non-overlapping groups of 6 consecutive PRBs, in ascending
order of the PRB index in the DL BWP bandwidth of
$N_{\text{RB}}^{\text{BWP}}$ PRBs with starting common RB position
$N_{\text{BWP}}^{\text{start}}$, where the first common RB of the first
group of 6 PRBs has common RB index
$6 \cdot \left\lceil N_{\text{BWP}}^{\text{start}}/6 \right\rceil$ if
*rb-Offset* is not provided, or the first common RB of the first group
of 6 PRBs has common RB index
$N_{\text{BWP}}^{\text{start}} + N_{\text{RB}}^{\text{offset}}$ where
$N_{\text{RB}}^{\text{offset}}$ is provided by *rb-Offset.*

\- if a CORESET is associated with at least one search space set
configured with *freqMonitorLocations*, the first
$N_{RBG,set0}^{\text{size}}$ bits of the bitmap have a one-to-one
mapping with non-overlapping groups of 6 consecutive PRBs, in ascending
order of the PRB index in each RB set $k$ in the DL BWP bandwidth of
$N_{\text{RB}}^{\text{BWP}}$ PRBs with starting common RB position
$\text{RB}_{s0 + k,DL}^{\text{start},\mu}\ $ \[6, TS 38.214\], where the
first common RB of the first group of 6 PRBs has common RB index
$\text{RB}_{s0 + k,DL}^{\text{start},\mu} + N_{\text{RB}}^{\text{offset}}$
and *k* is indicated by *freqMonitorLocations* if provided for a search
space set; otherwise, $k = 0$.
$N_{RBG,set0}^{\text{size}} = \left\lfloor {(N}_{RB,set0}^{\text{size}} - N_{\text{RB}}^{\text{offset}})/6 \right\rfloor$,
$N_{RB,set0}^{\text{size}}$ is a number of available PRBs in the RB set
0 for the DL BWP, and $N_{\text{RB}}^{\text{offset}}$ is provided by
*rb-Offset* or $N_{\text{RB}}^{\text{offset}} = 0$ if *rb-Offset* is not
provided. If a UE is provided RB sets in the DL BWP, the UE expects that
the RBs of the CORESET are within the union of the PRBs in the RB sets
of the DL BWP.

For a CORESET other than a CORESET with index 0,

\- if a UE has not been provided a configuration of TCI state(s) by
*tci-StatesPDCCH-ToAddList* and *tci-StatesPDCCH-ToReleaseList* for the
CORESET, or has been provided initial configuration of more than one TCI
states for the CORESET by *tci-StatesPDCCH-ToAddList* and
*tci-StatesPDCCH-ToReleaseList* but has not received a MAC CE activation
command for one of the TCI states as described in \[11, TS 38.321\], the
UE assumes that the DM-RS antenna port associated with PDCCH receptions
is quasi co-located with the SS/PBCH block the UE identified during the
initial access procedure;

\- if a UE has been provided a configuration of more than one TCI states
by *tci-StatesPDCCH-ToAddList* and *tci-StatesPDCCH-ToReleaseList* for
the CORESET as part of Reconfiguration with sync procedure as described
in \[12, TS 38.331\] but has not received a MAC CE activation command
for one of the TCI states as described in \[11, TS 38.321\], the UE
assumes that the DM-RS antenna port associated with PDCCH receptions is
quasi co-located with the SS/PBCH block or the CSI-RS resource the UE
identified during the random access procedure initiated by the
Reconfiguration with sync procedure as described in \[12, TS 38.331\].

For a CORESET with index 0, the UE assumes that a DM-RS antenna port for
PDCCH receptions in the CORESET is quasi co-located with

\- the one or more DL RS configured by a TCI state, where the TCI state
is indicated by a MAC CE activation command for the CORESET, if any, or

\- a SS/PBCH block the UE identified during a most recent random access
procedure not initiated by a PDCCH order that triggers a contention-free
random access procedure, if no MAC CE activation command indicating a
TCI state for the CORESET is received after the most recent random
access procedure.

For a CORESET other than a CORESET with index 0, if a UE is provided a
single TCI state for a CORESET, or if the UE receives a MAC CE
activation command for one of the provided TCI states for a CORESET, the
UE assumes that the DM-RS antenna port associated with PDCCH receptions
in the CORESET is quasi co-located with the one or more DL RS configured
by the TCI state. For a CORESET with index 0, the UE expects that a
CSI-RS configured with *qcl-Type* set to \'typeD\' in a TCI state
indicated by a MAC CE activation command for the CORESET is provided by
a SS/PBCH block

\- if the UE receives a MAC CE activation command for one of the TCI
states, the UE applies the activation command in the first slot that is
after slot $k + 3N_{\text{slot}}^{\text{subframe},\mu}$ where $k$ is the
slot where the UE would transmit a PUCCH with HARQ-ACK information for
the PDSCH providing the activation command and $\mu$ is the SCS
configuration for the PUCCH. The active BWP is defined as the active BWP
in the slot when the activation command is applied.

If the UE is provided by *simultaneousTCI-UpdateList1* or
*simultaneousTCI-UpdateList2* up to two lists of cells for simultaneous
TCI state activation, the UE applies the antenna port quasi co-location
provided by *TCI-States* with same activated *tci-StateID* value to
CORESETs with a same index in all configured DL BWPs of all configured
cells in a list determined from a serving cell index, where
*tci-StateID*, the CORESET index and the serving cell index are provided
by a MAC CE command.

For each DL BWP configured to a UE in a serving cell, the UE is provided
by higher layers with $S \leq 10$ search space sets where, for each
search space set from the $S$ search space sets, the UE is provided the
following by *SearchSpace*:

\- a search space set index $s$, $0 < s < 40$ , by *searchSpaceId*

\- an association between the search space set$\text{\ s}$ and a CORESET
$p$ by *controlResourceSetId* or by *controlResourceSetId-v1610*

\- a PDCCH monitoring periodicity of $k_{s}$ slots and a PDCCH
monitoring offset of $o_{s}$ slots, by
*monitoringSlotPeriodicityAndOffset*

\- a PDCCH monitoring pattern within a slot, indicating first symbol(s)
of the CORESET within a slot for PDCCH monitoring, by
*monitoringSymbolsWithinSlot*

\- a duration of $T_{s} < k_{s}$ slots indicating a number of slots that
the search space set $s$ exists by *duration*

\- a number of PDCCH candidates $M_{s}^{(L)}$ *per CCE aggregation
level* $L$ by *aggregationLevel1*, *aggregationLevel2*,
*aggregationLevel4*, *aggregationLevel8*, and *aggregationLevel16*, for
CCE aggregation level 1, CCE aggregation level 2, CCE aggregation level
4, CCE aggregation level 8, and CCE aggregation level 16, respectively

\- an indication that search space set $s$ is either a CSS set or a USS
set by *searchSpaceType*

\- if search space set $s$ is a CSS set

\- an indication by *dci-Format0-0-AndFormat1-0* to monitor PDCCH
candidates for DCI format 0\_0 and DCI format 1\_0

\- an indication by *dci-Format2-0* to monitor one or two PDCCH
candidates, or to monitor one PDCCH candidate per RB set if the UE is
provided *freqMonitorLocations* for the search space set, for DCI format
2\_0 and a corresponding CCE aggregation level

\- an indication by *dci-Format2-1* to monitor PDCCH candidates for DCI
format 2\_1

\- an indication by *dci-Format2-2* to monitor PDCCH candidates for DCI
format 2\_2

\- an indication by *dci-Format2-3* to monitor PDCCH candidates for DCI
format 2\_3

\- an indication by *dci-Format2-4* to monitor PDCCH candidates for DCI
format 2\_4

\- an indication by *dci-Format2-6* to monitor PDCCH candidates for DCI
format 2\_6

\- if search space set $s$ is a USS set, an indication by *dci-Formats*
to monitor PDCCH candidates either for DCI format 0\_0 and DCI format
1\_0, or for DCI format 0\_1 and DCI format 1\_1, or an indication by
*dci-FormatsExt* to monitor PDCCH candidates for DCI format 0\_2 and DCI
format 1\_2, or for DCI format 0\_1, DCI format 1\_1, DCI format 0\_2,
and DCI format 1\_2, or an indication by *dci-FormatsSL* to monitor
PDCCH candidates for DCI format 0\_0 and DCI format 1\_0, or for DCI
format 0\_1 and DCI format 1\_1, or for DCI format 3\_0, or for DCI
format 3\_1, or for DCI format 3\_0 and DCI format 3\_1

\- a bitmap by *freqMonitorLocations*, if provided, to indicate an index
of one or more RB sets for the search space set $s$, where the MSB $k$
in the bitmap corresponds to RB set $k - 1$ in the DL BWP. For RB set
$k$ indicated in the bitmap, the first PRB of the frequency domain
monitoring location confined within the RB set is given by
$\text{RB}_{s0 + k,DL}^{\text{start},\mu} + N_{\text{RB}}^{\text{offset}}$,
where $\text{RB}_{s0 + k,DL}^{\text{start},\mu}$ is the index of first
common RB of the RB set $k$ \[6, TS 38.214\], and
$N_{\text{RB}}^{\text{offset}}$ is provided by *rb-Offset* or
$N_{\text{RB}}^{\text{offset}} = 0$ if *rb-Offset* is not provided. For
each RB set with a corresponding value of 1 in the bitmap, the frequency
domain resource allocation pattern for the monitoring location is
determined based on the first $N_{RBG,\ set\ 0}^{\text{size}}$ bits in
*frequencyDomainResources* provided by the associated CORESET
configuration.

If the *monitoringSymbolsWithinSlot* indicates to a UE to monitor PDCCH
in a subset of up to three consecutive symbols that are same in every
slot where the UE monitors PDCCH for all search space sets, the UE does
not expect to be configured with a PDCCH SCS other than 15 kHz if the
subset includes at least one symbol after the third symbol.

A UE does not expect to be provided a first symbol and a number of
consecutive symbols for a CORESET that results to a PDCCH candidate
mapping to symbols of different slots.

A UE does not expect any two PDCCH monitoring occasions on an active DL
BWP, for a same search space set or for different search space sets, in
a same CORESET to be separated by a non-zero number of symbols that is
smaller than the CORESET duration.

A UE determines a PDCCH monitoring occasion on an active DL BWP from the
PDCCH monitoring periodicity, the PDCCH monitoring offset, and the PDCCH
monitoring pattern within a slot. For search space set $s$, the UE
determines that a PDCCH monitoring occasion(s) exists in a slot with
number $n_{s,f}^{\mu}$ \[4, TS 38.211\] in a frame with number $n_{f}$
if ($n_{f}$.
$N_{\text{slot\ }}^{frame,\ \mu}$+$\ n_{s,f\ }^{\mu}$-$\ o_{s}$)$\ \text{mod}k_{s} = 0$$\left( n_{f}N_{\text{slot}}^{frame,\mu} + n_{s,f}^{\mu} - o_{p,s} \right)\text{mod\ }k_{p,s} = 0$.
The UE monitors PDCCH candidates for search space set $s$ for $T_{s}$
consecutive slots, starting from slot $n_{s,f}^{\mu}$, and does not
monitor PDCCH candidates for search space set $s$ for the next
$k_{s} - T_{s}$ consecutive slots.

A USS at CCE aggregation level
$L \in \left\{ 1,\ 2,\ 4,\ 8,\ 16 \right\}$ is defined by a set of PDCCH
candidates for CCE aggregation level $L$.

If a UE is configured with *CrossCarrierSchedulingConfig* for a serving
cell the carrier indicator field value corresponds to the value
indicated by *CrossCarrierSchedulingConfig.*

For an active DL BWP of a serving cell on which a UE monitors PDCCH
candidates in a USS, if the UE is not configured with a carrier
indicator field, the UE monitors the PDCCH candidates without carrier
indicator field. For an active DL BWP of a serving cell on which a UE
monitors PDCCH candidates in a USS, if a UE is configured with a carrier
indicator field, the UE monitors the PDCCH candidates with carrier
indicator field.

A UE does not expect to monitor PDCCH candidates on an active DL BWP of
a secondary cell if the UE is configured to monitor PDCCH candidates
with carrier indicator field corresponding to that secondary cell in
another serving cell. For the active DL BWP of a serving cell on which
the UE monitors PDCCH candidates, the UE monitors PDCCH candidates at
least for the same serving cell.

For a search space set $s$ associated with CORESET $p$, the CCE indexes
for aggregation level $L$ corresponding to PDCCH candidate
$m_{{s,n}_{\text{CI}}}$ of the search space set in slot $n_{s,f}^{\mu}$
for an active DL BWP of a serving cell corresponding to carrier
indicator field value $n_{\text{CI}}$are given by

$$L \cdot \left\{ \left( Y_{p,n_{s,f}^{\mu}} + \left\lfloor \frac{m_{{s,n}_{\text{CI}}} \cdot N_{\text{CCE},p}}{L \cdot M_{s,\max}^{\left( L \right)}} \right\rfloor + n_{\text{CI}} \right)\text{mod}\left\lfloor \frac{N_{\text{CCE},p}}{L} \right\rfloor \right\} + i$$

where

for any CSS, $Y_{p,n_{s,f}^{\mu}} = 0$;

for a USS,
$Y_{p,n_{s,f}^{\mu}} = \left( {A_{p} \cdot Y}_{p,n_{s,f}^{\mu} - 1} \right)\text{modD}$,
$Y_{p, - 1} = n_{\text{RNTI}} \neq 0$, $A_{p} = 39827$ for $pmod3 = 0$,
$A_{p} = 39829$ for $pmod3 = 1$, $A_{p} = 39839$ for $pmod3 = 2$, and
$D = 65537$;

$i = 0,\cdots,L - 1$;

$N_{\text{CCE},p}$ is the number of CCEs, numbered from 0 to
$N_{\text{CCE},p} - 1$, in CORESET $p$ and, if any, per RB set;

$n_{\text{CI}}$ is the carrier indicator field value if the UE is
configured with a carrier indicator field by
*CrossCarrierSchedulingConfig* for the serving cell on which PDCCH is
monitored; otherwise, including for any CSS, $n_{\text{CI}} = 0$;

$m_{{s,n}_{\text{CI}}} = 0,\cdots,M_{s,n_{\text{CI}}}^{\left( L \right)} - 1$,
where $M_{s,n_{\text{CI}}}^{\left( L \right)}$ is the number of PDCCH
candidates the UE is configured to monitor for aggregation level $L$ of
a search space set $s$ for a serving cell corresponding to
$n_{\text{CI}}$;

for any CSS,
$M_{s,\max}^{\left( L \right)} = M_{s,0}^{\left( L \right)}$;

for a USS, $M_{s,\max}^{\left( L \right)}$ is the maximum of
$M_{s,n_{\text{CI}}}^{\left( L \right)}$ over all configured
$n_{\text{CI}}$ values for a CCE aggregation level $L$ of search space
set $s$ ;

the RNTI value used for $n_{\text{RNTI}}$ is the C-RNTI.

A UE does not expect to be provided *freqMonitorLocations* for a search
space set $s$ in a serving cell if *intraCellGuardBandsDL-List*
indicates that no intra-cell guard-bands are configured for the serving
cell.

A UE that

\- is configured for operation with carrier aggregation, and

\- indicates support of search space sharing through
*searchSpaceSharingCA-UL* or through *searchSpaceSharingCA-DL*, and

\- has a PDCCH candidate with CCE aggregation level $L$ in CORESET $p$
for a first DCI format scheduling PUSCH transmission or UL grant Type 2
PUSCH release, other than DCI format 0\_0, or for a second DCI format
scheduling PDSCH reception or SPS PDSCH release or indicating SCell
dormancy or indicating a request for a Type-3 HARQ-ACK codebook report
without scheduling PDSCH, other than DCI format 1\_0, having a first
size and associated with serving cell $n_{CI,2}$,

can receive a corresponding PDCCH through a PDCCH candidate with CCE
aggregation level $L$ in CORESET $p$ for a first DCI format or for a
second DCI format, respectively, having a second size and associated
with serving cell $n_{CI,1}$ if the first size and the second size are
same.

A UE expects to monitor PDCCH candidates for up to 4 sizes of DCI
formats that include up to 3 sizes of DCI formats with CRC scrambled by
C-RNTI per serving cell. The UE counts a number of sizes for DCI formats
per serving cell based on a number of configured PDCCH candidates in
respective search space sets for the corresponding active DL BWP.

A UE does not expect to detect, in a same PDCCH monitoring occasion, a
DCI format with CRC scrambled by a SI-RNTI, RA-RNTI, MsgB-RNTI, TC-RNTI,
P-RNTI, C-RNTI, CS-RNTI, or MCS-RNTI and a DCI format with CRC scrambled
by a SL-RNTI or a SL-CS-RNTI for scheduling respective PDSCH reception
and PSSCH transmission on a same serving cell.

A PDCCH candidate with index $m_{s_{j},n_{\text{CI}}}$ for a search
space set $s_{j}$ using a set of CCEs in a CORESET $p$ on the active DL
BWP for serving cell $n_{\text{CI}}$ is not counted for monitoring if
there is a PDCCH candidate with index $m_{s_{i},n_{\text{CI}}}$ for a
search space set $s_{i}{< s}_{j}$, or if there is a PDCCH candidate with
index $n_{s_{j},n_{\text{CI}}}$ and
$n_{s_{j},n_{\text{CI}}} < m_{s_{j},n_{\text{CI}}}$, in the CORESET $p$
on the active DL BWP for serving cell $n_{\text{CI}}$ using a same set
of CCEs, the PDCCH candidates have identical scrambling, and the
corresponding DCI formats for the PDCCH candidates have a same size;
otherwise, the PDCCH candidate with index $m_{s_{j},n_{\text{CI}}}$ is
counted for monitoring.

$M_{\text{PDCCH}}^{max,slot,\mu}$, per slot for a UE in a DL BWP with

A UE does not expect to be configured CSS sets that result to
corresponding total, or per scheduled cell, numbers of monitored PDCCH
candidates and non-overlapped CCEs per slot or per span that exceed the
corresponding maximum numbers per slot or per span, respectively.

For same cell scheduling or for cross-carrier scheduling, a UE does not
expect a number of PDCCH candidates, and a number of corresponding
non-overlapped CCEs per slot or per span on a secondary cell to be
larger than the corresponding numbers that the UE is capable of
monitoring on the secondary cell per slot or per span, respectively. If
a UE is provided *monitoringCapabilityConfig* =

each slot, the UE does not expect a number of PDCCH candidates and a
number of corresponding non-overlapped CCEs per span on the primary cell
to be larger than the corresponding numbers that the UE is capable of
monitoring on the primary cell per span.

For cross-carrier scheduling, the number of PDCCH candidates for

If a UE

\- is configured to monitor a first PDCCH candidate for a DCI format
0\_0 and a DCI format 1\_0 from a CSS set and a second PDCCH candidate
for a DCI format 0\_0 and a DCI format 1\_0 from a USS set in a CORESET
with index zero on an active DL BWP, and

\- the DCI formats 0\_0/1\_0 associated with the first PDCCH candidate
and the DCI formats 0\_0/1\_0 associated with the second PDCCH candidate

\- the UE receives the first PDCCH candidate and the second PDCCH
candidate over a same set of CCEs, and

\- the first PDCCH candidate and the second PDCCH candidate have
identical scrambling, and

\- the DCI formats 0\_0/1\_0 for the first PDCCH candidate and the DCI
formats 0\_0/1\_0 for the second PDCCH candidate have CRC scrambled by
either C-RNTI, or MCS-C-RNTI, or CS-RNTI

the UE decodes only the DCI formats 0\_0/1\_0 associated with the first
PDCCH candidate.

If a UE detects a DCI format with inconsistent information, the UE
discards **all** the information in the DCI format.

A UE configured with a bandwidth part indicator in a DCI format
determines, in case of an active DL BWP or of an active UL BWP change,
that the information in the DCI format is applicable to the new active
DL BWP or UL BWP, respectively, as described in clause 12.

For unpaired spectrum operation, if a UE is not configured for
PUSCH/PUCCH transmission on serving cell $c_{2}$, the UE does not expect
to monitor PDCCH on serving cell $c_{1}$ if the PDCCH overlaps in time
with SRS transmission (including any interruption due to uplink or
downlink RF retuning time \[10, TS 38.133\]) on serving cell $c_{2}$ and
if the UE is not capable of simultaneous reception and transmission on
serving cell $c_{1}$and serving cell $c_{2}$.

If a UE is provided *resourceBlocks* and s*ymbolsInResourceBlock* in
*RateMatchPattern*, or if the UE is additionally provided
*periodicityAndPattern* in *RateMatchPattern*, the UE can determine a
set of RBs in symbols of a slot that are not available for PDSCH
reception as described in \[6, TS 38.214\]. If a PDCCH candidate in a
slot is mapped to one or more REs that overlap with REs of any RB in the
set of RBs in symbols of the slot, the UE does not expect to monitor the
PDCCH candidate.

A UE does not expect to be configured with *dci-FormatsSL* and
*dci-FormatsExt* in a same USS.

10.2 PDCCH validation for DL SPS and UL grant Type 2
----------------------------------------------------

A UE validates, for scheduling activation or scheduling release, a DL
SPS assignment PDCCH or a configured UL grant Type 2 PDCCH if

\- the CRC of a corresponding DCI format is scrambled with a CS-RNTI
provided by *cs-RNTI*, and

\- the new data indicator field in the DCI format for the enabled
transport block is set to \'0\', and

\- the DFI flag field, if present, in the DCI format is set to \'0\',
and

\- the time domain resource assignment field in the DCI format indicates
a row with single SLIV, and

\- *if validation is for* scheduling activation and if the
PDSCH-to-HARQ\_feedback timing indicator field in the DCI format is
present, the PDSCH-to-HARQ\_feedback timing indicator field does not
provide an inapplicable value from *dl-DataToUL-ACK-r16*.

If a UE is provided a single configuration for UL grant Type 2 PUSCH or
for SPS PDSCH, validation of the DCI format is achieved if all fields
for the DCI format are set according to Table 10.2-1 or Table 10.2-2.

If a UE is provided more than one configurations for UL grant Type 2
PUSCH or for SPS PDSCH, a value of the HARQ process number field in a
DCI format indicates an activation for a corresponding UL grant Type 2
PUSCH or for a SPS PDSCH configuration with a same value as provided by
*ConfiguredGrantConfigIndex* or by *sps-ConfigIndex*, respectively.
Validation of the DCI format is achieved if the RV field for the DCI
format is set as in Table 10.2-3.

If a UE is provided more than one configuration for UL grant Type 2
PUSCH or for SPS PDSCH

\- if the UE is provided
*ConfiguredGrantConfigType2DeactivationStateList* or
*sps-ConfigDeactivationStateList*, a value of the HARQ process number
field in a DCI format indicates a corresponding entry for scheduling
release of one or more UL grant Type 2 PUSCH or SPS PDSCH configurations

\- if the UE is not provided
*ConfiguredGrantConfigType2DeactivationStateList* or
*sps-ConfigDeactivationStateList*, a value of the HARQ process number
field in a DCI format indicates a release for a corresponding UL grant
Type 2 PUSCH or for a SPS PDSCH configuration with a same value as
provided by *ConfiguredGrantConfigIndex* or by *sps-ConfigIndex*,
respectively

Validation of the DCI format is achieved if all fields for the DCI
format are set according to Table 10.2-4.

If validation is achieved, the UE considers the information in the DCI
format as a valid activation or valid release of DL SPS or configured UL
grant Type 2. If validation is not achieved, the UE discards all the
information in the DCI format.

**Table 10.2-1: Special fields for single DL SPS or single UL grant Type
2 scheduling activation PDCCH validation** when a UE is provided a
single *SPS PDSCH* **or UL grant Type 2** *configuration* **in the
active DL/UL BWP of the scheduled cell**

A UE is expected to provide HARQ-ACK information in response to a SPS
PDSCH release after $N$ symbols from the last symbol of a PDCCH
providing the SPS PDSCH release. If *processingType2Enabled* of
*PDSCH-ServingCellConfig* is set to *enable* for the serving cell with
the PDCCH providing the SPS PDSCH release, $N = 5$ for $\mu = 0$,
$N = 5.5$ for $\mu = 1$, and $N = 11$ for $\mu = 2$, otherwise, $N = 10$
for $\mu = 0$, $N = 12$ for $\mu = 1$, $N = 22$ for $\mu = 2$, and
$N = 25$ for $\mu = 3$, wherein $\mu$ corresponds to the smallest SCS
configuration between the SCS configuration of the PDCCH providing the
SPS PDSCH release and the SCS configuration of a PUCCH carrying the
HARQ-ACK information in response to a SPS PDSCH release.

10.2A PDCCH validation for SL configured grant Type 2
-----------------------------------------------------

A UE validates, for scheduling activation or scheduling release, a SL
configured grant Type 2 PDCCH if

\- the CRC of a corresponding DCI format 3\_0 is scrambled with a
SL-CS-RNTI provided by *sl-CS-RNTI*, and

\- the new data indicator field in the DCI format 3\_0 for the enabled
transport block is set to \'0\'

Validation of the DCI format 3\_0 is achieved if all fields for the DCI
format 3\_0 are set according to Table 10.2A-1 or Table 10.2A-2.

If validation is achieved, the UE considers the information in the DCI
format 3\_0 as a valid activation or valid release of SL configured
grant Type 2. If validation is not achieved, the UE discards all the
information in the DCI format 3\_0.

**Table 10.2A-1: Special fields for SL configured grant Type 2

10.3 PDCCH monitoring indication and dormancy/non-dormancy behaviour for SCells
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A UE configured with DRX mode operation \[11, TS 38.321\] can be
provided the following for detection of a DCI format 2\_6 in a PDCCH
reception on the PCell or on the SpCell \[12, TS 38.331\]

\- a PS-RNTI for DCI format 2\_6 by *ps-RNTI*

\- a number of search space sets, by *dci-Format2-6,* to monitor PDCCH
for detection of DCI format 2\_6 on the active DL BWP of the PCell or of
the SpCell according to a common search space as described in clause
10.1

\- a payload size for DCI format 2\_6 by *sizeDCI-2-6*

\- a location in DCI format 2\_6 of a Wake-up indication bit by
*ps-PositionDCI-2-6*

\- a \'0\' value for the Wake-up indication bit, when reported to higher
layers, indicates to not start the *drx-onDurationTimer* for the next
long DRX cycle \[11, TS 38.321\]

\- a \'1\' value for the Wake-up indication bit, when reported to higher
layers, indicates to start the *drx-onDurationTimer* for the next long
DRX cycle \[11, TS 38.321\]

\- a bitmap, when the UE is provided a number of groups of configured
SCells by *dormancyGroupOutsideActiveTime*, where

\- the bitmap location is immediately after the Wake-up indication bit
location

\- the bitmap size is equal to the number of groups of configured SCells
where each bit of the bitmap corresponds to a group of configured SCells
from the number of groups of configured SCells

\- a \'0\' value for a bit of the bitmap indicates an active DL BWP,
provided by *dormantBWP-Id*, for the UE \[11, TS 38.321\] for each
activated SCell in the corresponding group of configured SCells

\- a \'1\' value for a bit of the bitmap indicates

\- an active DL BWP, provided by *firstOutsideActiveTimeBWP-Id,* for the
UE for each activated SCell in the corresponding group of configured
SCells, if a current active DL BWP is the dormant DL BWP

\- a current active DL BWP*,* for the UE for each activated SCell in the
corresponding group of configured SCells, if the current active DL BWP
is not the dormant DL BWP

\- the UE sets the active DL BWP to the indicated active DL BWP

\- an offset by *ps-Offset* indicating a time, where the UE starts
monitoring PDCCH for detection of DCI format 2\_6 according to the
number of search space sets, prior to a slot where the
*drx-onDurationTimer* would start on the PCell or on the SpCell \[11, TS
38.321\]

\- for each search space set, the PDCCH monitoring occasions are the
ones in the first $T_{\text{s}}$ slots indicated by *duration*, or
$T_{\text{s}} = 1$ slot if *duration* is not provided, starting from the
first slot of the first $T_{\text{s}}$ slots and ending prior to the
start of *drx-onDurationTimer*.

On PDCCH monitoring occasions associated with a same long DRX Cycle, a
UE does not expect to detect more than one DCI format 2\_6 with
different values of the Wake-up indication bit for the UE or with
different values of the bitmap for the UE.

The UE does not monitor PDCCH for detecting DCI format 2\_6 during
Active Time \[11, TS 38.321\].

If a UE reports for an active DL BWP a *MinTimeGap* value that is X
slots prior to the beginning of a slot where the UE would start the
*drx-onDurationTimer*, the UE is not required to monitor PDCCH for
detection of DCI format 2\_6 during the X slots, where X corresponds to
the *MinTimeGap* value of the SCS of the active DL BWP in Table 10.3-1.

Table 10.3-1 Minimum time gap value X

  SCS (kHz)   Minimum Time Gap X (slots)   
  ----------- ---------------------------- ---------
              Value 1                      Value 2
  15          1                            3
  30          1                            6
  60          1                            12
  120         2                            24

If a UE is provided search space sets to monitor PDCCH for detection of
DCI format 2\_6 in the active DL BWP of the PCell or of the SpCell and
the UE detects DCI format 2\_6, the physical layer of a UE reports the
value of the Wake-up indication bit for the UE to higher layers \[11, TS
38.321\] for the next long DRX cycle.

If a UE is provided search space sets to monitor PDCCH for detection of
DCI format 2\_6 in the active DL BWP of the PCell or of the SpCell and
the UE does not detect DCI format 2\_6, the physical layer of the UE
does not report a value of the Wake-up indication bit to higher layers
for the next long DRX cycle.

If a UE is provided search space sets to monitor PDCCH for detection of
DCI format 2\_6 in the active DL BWP of the PCell or of the SpCell and
the UE

\- is not required to monitor PDCCH for detection of DCI format 2\_6, as
described in clauses 10, 11.1, 12, and in clause 5.7 of \[11, TS
38.321\] for all corresponding PDCCH monitoring occasions outside Active
Time prior to a next long DRX cycle, or

\- does not have any PDCCH monitoring occasions for detection of DCI
format 2\_6 outside Active Time of a next long DRX cycle

the physical layer of the UE reports a value of 1 for the Wake-up
indication bit to higher layers for the next long DRX cycle.

If a UE is provided search space sets to monitor PDCCH for detection of
DCI format 0\_1 and DCI format 1\_1 and if one or both of DCI format
0\_1 and DCI format 1\_1 include a SCell dormancy indication field,

\- the SCell dormancy indication field is a bitmap with size equal to a
number of groups of configured SCells, provided by
*dormancyGroupWithinActiveTime*,

\- each bit of the bitmap corresponds to a group of configured SCells
from the number of groups of configured Scells

\- if the UE detects a DCI format 0\_1 or a DCI format 1\_1 that does
not include a carrier indicator field, or detects a DCI format 0\_1 or
DCI format 1\_1 that includes a carrier indicator field with value equal
to 0, and if the DCI format 0\_1 does not indicate UL grant Type 2
release nor deactivate semi-persistent CSI report(s) on PUSCH, or if the
DCI format 1\_1 does not indicate SPS PDSCH release

\- a \'0\' value for a bit of the bitmap indicates an active DL BWP,
provided by *dormantBWP-Id*, for the UE for each activated SCell in the
corresponding group of configured SCells

\- a \'1\' value for a bit of the bitmap indicates

\- an active DL BWP, provided by *firstWithinActiveTimeBWP-Id,* for the
UE for each activated SCell in the corresponding group of configured
SCells, if a current active DL BWP is the dormant DL BWP

\- a current active DL BWP*,* for the UE for each activated SCell in the
corresponding group of configured SCells, if the current active DL BWP
is not the dormant DL BWP

\- the UE sets the active DL BWP to the indicated active DL BWP

If a UE is provided search space sets to monitor PDCCH for detection of
DCI format 1\_1, and if

\- the CRC of DCI format 1\_1 is scrambled by a C-RNTI or a MCS-C-RNTI,
and if

\- a one-shot HARQ-ACK request field is not present or has a \'0\'
value, and if

\- the UE detects a DCI format 1\_1 on the primary cell that does not
include a carrier indicator field, or detects a DCI format 1\_1 on the
primary cell that includes a carrier indicator field with value equal to
0, and if

\- *resourceAllocation* = *resourceAllocationType0* and all bits of the
frequency domain resource assignment field in DCI format 1\_1 are equal
to 0, or

\- *resourceAllocation* = *resourceAllocationType1* and all bits of the
frequency domain resource assignment field in DCI format 1\_1 are equal
to 1, or

\- *resourceAllocation = dynamicSwitch* and all bits of the frequency
domain resource assignment field in DCI format 1\_1 are equal to 0 or 1

the UE considers the DCI format 1\_1 as indicating SCell dormancy, not
scheduling a PDSCH reception, and for transport block 1 interprets the
sequence of fields of

\- modulation and coding scheme

\- new data indicator

\- redundancy version

and of

\- HARQ process number

\- antenna port(s)

\- DMRS sequence initialization

as providing a bitmap to each configured SCell, in an ascending order of
the SCell index, where

\- a \'0\' value for a bit of the bitmap indicates an active DL BWP,
provided by *dormantBWP-Id*, for the UE for a corresponding activated
SCell

\- a \'1\' value for a bit of the bitmap indicates

\- an active DL BWP, provided by *firstWithinActiveTimeBWP-Id,* for the
UE for a corresponding activated SCell, if a current active DL BWP is
the dormant DL BWP

\- a current active DL BWP*,* for the UE for a corresponding activated
SCell, if the current active DL BWP is not the dormant DL BWP

\- the UE sets the active DL BWP to the indicated active DL BWP

If an active DL BWP provided by *dormantBWP-Id* for a UE on an activated
SCell is not a default DL BWP for the UE on the activated SCell, as
described in clause 12, the BWP inactivity timer is not used for
transitioning from the active DL BWP provided by *dormantBWP-Id* to the
default DL BWP on the activated SCell.

A UE is expected to provide HARQ-ACK information in response to a
detection of a DCI format 1\_1 indicating SCell dormancy after
$N$ symbols from the last symbol of a PDCCH providing the DCI format
1\_1. If *processingType2Enabled* of *PDSCH-ServingCellConfig* is set to
*enable* for the serving cell with the PDCCH providing the DCI format
1\_1, $N = 7$ for $\mu = 0$, $N = 7.5$ for $\mu = 1$, and $N = 15$ for
$\mu = 2$; otherwise, $N = 14$ for $\mu = 0$, $N = 16$ for $\mu = 1$,
$N = 27$ for $\mu = 2$, and $N = 31$ for $\mu = 3$, where $\mu$ is the
smallest SCS configuration between the SCS configuration of the PDCCH
providing the DCI format 1\_1 and the SCS configuration of a PUCCH with
the HARQ-ACK information in response to the detection of the DCI format
1\_1.

10.4 Search space set group switching
-------------------------------------

A UE can be provided a group index for a respective Type3-PDCCH CSS set
or USS set by *searchSpaceGroupIdList* for PDCCH monitoring on a serving
cell. If the UE is not provided *searchSpaceGroupIdList* for a search
space set, the following procedures are not applicable for PDCCH
monitoring according to the search space set.

If a UE is provided *cellGroupsForSwitchList*, indicating one or more
groups of serving cells, the following procedures apply to all serving
cells within each group; otherwise, the following procedures apply only
to a serving cell for which the UE is provided *searchSpaceGroupIdList*.

When a UE is provided *searchSpaceGroupIdList*, the UE resets PDCCH
monitoring according to search space sets with group index 0, if
provided by *searchSpaceGroupIdList*.

A UE can be provided by *searchSpaceSwitchDelay* a number of symbols
$P_{\text{switch}}$ where a minimum value of $P_{\text{switch}}$ is
provided in Table 10.4-1 for UE processing capability 1 and UE
processing capability 2 and SCS configuration $\mu$. UE processing
capability 1 for SCS configuration $\mu$ applies unless the UE indicates
support for UE processing capability 2.

+------------------+------------------------+------------------------+

A UE can be provided, by *searchSpaceSwitchTimer*, a timer value for a
serving cell that the UE is provided *searchSpaceGroupIdList* or, if
provided, for a set of serving cells provided by
*cellGroupsForSwitchList*. The UE decrements the timer value by one
after each slot based on a reference SCS configuration that is the
smallest SCS configuration $\mu$ among all configured DL BWPs in the
serving cell, or in the set of serving cells. The UE maintains the
reference SCS configuration during the timer decrement procedure.

If a UE is provided by *SearchSpaceSwitchTrigger a location of a search
space set group switching flag field for a serving cell in a DCI format
2\_0*, as described in clause 11.1.1;

\- if the UE detects a DCI format 2\_0 and a value of the search space
set group switching flag field in the DCI format 2\_0 is 0, the UE
starts monitoring PDCCH according to search space sets with group index
0, and stops monitoring PDCCH according to search space sets with group
index 1, for the serving cell at a first slot that is at least
$P_{\text{switch}}$ symbols after the last symbol of the PDCCH with the
DCI format 2\_0

\- if the UE detects a DCI format 2\_0 and a value of the search space
set group switching flag field in the DCI format 2\_0 is 1, the UE
starts monitoring PDCCH according to search space sets with group index
1, and stops monitoring PDCCH according to search space sets with group
index 0, for the serving cell at a first slot that is at least
$P_{\text{switch}}$ symbols after the last symbol of the PDCCH with the
DCI format 2\_0, and the UE sets the timer value to the value provided
by *searchSpaceSwitchTimer*

\- if the UE monitors PDCCH for a serving cell according to search space
sets with group index 1, the UE starts monitoring PDCCH for the serving
cell according to search space sets with group index 0, and stops
monitoring PDCCH according to search space sets with group index 1, for
the serving cell at the beginning of the first slot that is at least
$P_{\text{switch}}$ symbols after a slot where the timer expires or
after a last symbol of a remaining channel occupancy duration for the
serving cell if indicated by DCI format 2\_0

If a UE is not provided *SearchSpaceSwitchTrigger for a serving cell*,

\- if the UE detects a DCI format by monitoring PDCCH according to a
search space set with group index 0, the UE starts monitoring PDCCH
according to search space sets with group index 1, and stops monitoring
PDCCH according to search space sets with group index 0, for the serving
cell at a first slot that is at least $P_{\text{switch}}$ symbols after
the last symbol of the PDCCH with the DCI format, the UE sets the timer
value to the value provided by *searchSpaceSwitchTimer* if the UE
detects a DCI format by monitoring PDCCH in any search space set

\- if the UE monitors PDCCH for a serving cell according to search space
sets with group index 1, the UE starts monitoring PDCCH for the serving
cell according to search space sets with group index 0, and stops
monitoring PDCCH according to search space sets with group index 1, for
the serving cell at the beginning of the first slot that is at least
$P_{\text{switch}}$ symbols after a slot where the timer expires or, if
the UE is provided a search space set to monitor PDCCH for detecting a
DCI format 2\_0, after a last symbol of a remaining channel occupancy
duration for the serving cell if indicated by DCI format 2\_0

A UE determines a slot and a symbol in the slot to start or stop PDCCH
monitoring according to search space sets for a serving cell that the UE
is provided *searchSpaceGroupIdList* or, if *cellGroupsForSwitchList* is
provided, for a set of serving cells, based on the smallest SCS
configuration $\mu$ among all configured DL BWPs in the serving cell or
in the set of serving cells and, if any, in the serving cell where the
UE receives a PDCCH and detects a corresponding DCI format 2\_0
triggering the start or stop of PDCCH monitoring according to search
space sets.

10.5 HARQ-ACK information for PUSCH transmissions
-------------------------------------------------

A UE can be configured a number of search space sets to monitor PDCCH
for detecting a DCI format 0\_1 with a DFI flag field and CRC scrambled
with a CS-RNTI provided by *cs-RNTI*. The UE determines that the DCI
format provides HARQ-ACK information for PUSCH transmissions *based on
when a DFI flag field value is set to \'1\', if a* PUSCH transmission is
configured by *ConfiguredGrantConfig.*

*The HARQ-ACK information corresponds to transport blocks in PUSCH
transmissions for all HARQ processes for a serving cell of a PDCCH
reception that provides DCI format 0\_1 or, if DCI format 0\_1 includes
a carrier indicator field, for a serving cell indicated by a value of
the carrier indicator field.*

*For a PUSCH transmission* configured by *ConfiguredGrantConfig,
HARQ-ACK information for a transport block of a corresponding HARQ
process number is valid if a first symbol of the PDCCH reception is
after a last symbol of the PUSCH transmission, or of any repetition of
the PUSCH transmission, by a number of symbols provided by
cg-minDFI-Delay.*

For an initial transmission by a UE of a transport block in a PUSCH
configured by *ConfiguredGrantConfig, if the UE receives a CG-DFI that
provides HARQ-ACK information for the transport block, the UE assumes
that the transport block was correctly decoded if the HARQ-ACK
information value is ACK; otherwise, the UE assumes that the transport
block was not correctly decoded.*

*For a PUSCH transmission scheduled by a DCI format, if the UE receives
a CG-DFI that provides HARQ-ACK information for the transport block, the
UE assumes that the transport block was correctly decoded if the
HARQ-ACK information value is ACK; otherwise, the UE assumes that the
transport block was not correctly decoded.*

*For a PUSCH transmission* scheduled by a DCI format, *HARQ-ACK
information for a transport block of a corresponding HARQ process number
is valid if a first symbol of the PDCCH reception is after a last symbol
of the PUSCH transmission* by a number of symbols provided by
*cg-minDFI-Delay or, if the PUSCH transmission is over multiple slots,*

\- after a last symbol of the PUSCH transmission in a first slot from
the multiple slots by a number of symbols provided by *cg-minDFI-Delay*,
if a value of the HARQ-ACK information is ACK.

\- after a last symbol of the PUSCH transmission in a last slot from the
multiple slots by a number of symbols provided by *cg-minDFI-Delay*, if
a value of the HARQ-ACK information is NACK.

UE does not expect to be configured with different *cg-minDFI-Delay-r16*
among multiple *ConfiguredGrantConfig in one BWP*.

11 UE-group common signalling 
=============================

If the UE is configured with a SCG, the UE shall apply the procedures
described in this clause for both MCG and SCG

\- When the procedures are applied for MCG, the terms \'secondary
cell\', \'secondary cells\' , \'serving cell\', \'serving cells\' in
this clause refer to secondary cell, secondary cells, serving cell,
serving cells belonging to the MCG respectively.

\- When the procedures are applied for SCG, the terms \'secondary
cell\', \'secondary cells\', \'serving cell\', \'serving cells\' in this
clause refer to secondary cell, secondary cells (not including PSCell),
serving cell, serving cells belonging to the SCG respectively. The term
\'primary cell\' in this clause refers to the PSCell of the SCG.

11.1 Slot configuration
-----------------------

A slot format includes downlink symbols, uplink symbols, and flexible
symbols.

The following are applicable for each serving cell.

If a UE is provided *tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon*, the UE sets the
slot format per slot over a number of slots as indicated by
*tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon*.

The *tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon* provides

\- a reference SCS configuration ![](media/image790.wmf) by
*referenceSubcarrierSpacing*

> \- a *pattern1*.

The *pattern1* provides

\- a slot configuration period of ![](media/image791.wmf) msec by
*dl-UL-TransmissionPeriodicity*

\- a number of slots ![](media/image792.wmf) with only downlink symbols
by *nrofDownlinkSlots*

\- a number of downlink symbols ![](media/image793.wmf) by
*nrofDownlinkSymbols*

\- a number of slots ![](media/image794.wmf) with only uplink symbols by
*nrofUplinkSlots*

\- a number of uplink symbols ![](media/image795.wmf) by
*nrofUplinkSymbols*

A value ![](media/image796.wmf) msec is valid only for
![](media/image797.wmf). A value ![](media/image798.wmf) msec is valid
only for ![](media/image799.wmf) or ![](media/image800.wmf). A value
![](media/image801.wmf) msec is valid only for ![](media/image802.wmf),
or ![](media/image803.wmf), or ![](media/image804.wmf).

A slot configuration period of ![](media/image791.wmf) msec includes
![](media/image805.wmf) slots with SCS configuration
![](media/image806.wmf). From the ![](media/image807.wmf) slots, a first
![](media/image808.wmf) slots include only downlink symbols and a last
![](media/image794.wmf) slots include only uplink symbols. The
![](media/image809.wmf) symbols after the first ![](media/image808.wmf)
slots are downlink symbols. The ![](media/image795.wmf) symbols before
the last ![](media/image794.wmf) slots are uplink symbols. The remaining
![](media/image810.wmf) are flexible symbols.

The first symbol every ![](media/image811.wmf) periods is a first symbol
in an even frame.

If *tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon* provides both *pattern1* and
*pattern2*, the UE sets the slot format per slot over a first number of
slots as indicated by *pattern1* and the UE sets the slot format per
slot over a second number of slots as indicated by *pattern2*.

The *pattern2* provides

\- a slot configuration period of ![](media/image812.wmf) msec by
*dl-UL-TransmissionPeriodicity*

\- a number of slots ![](media/image813.wmf) with only downlink symbols
by *nrofDownlinkSlots*

\- a number of downlink symbols ![](media/image814.wmf) by
*nrofDownlinkSymbols*

\- a number of slots ![](media/image815.wmf) with only uplink symbols by
*nrofUplinkSlots*

\- a number of uplink symbols ![](media/image816.wmf) by
*nrofUplinkSymbols*

The applicable values of ![](media/image817.wmf) are same as the
applicable values for ![](media/image791.wmf).

A slot configuration period of ![](media/image818.wmf) msec includes
first ![](media/image819.wmf) slots and second ![](media/image820.wmf)
slots.

From the ![](media/image821.wmf) slots, a first ![](media/image822.wmf)
slots include only downlink symbols and a last ![](media/image815.wmf)
include only uplink symbols. The ![](media/image823.wmf) symbols after
the first ![](media/image822.wmf) slots are downlink symbols. The
![](media/image824.wmf) symbols before the last ![](media/image815.wmf)
slots are uplink symbols. The remaining ![](media/image825.wmf) are
flexible symbols.

A UE expects that ![](media/image818.wmf) divides 20 msec.

The first symbol every ![](media/image826.wmf) periods is a first symbol
in an even frame.

A UE expects that the reference SCS configuration
![](media/image827.wmf) is smaller than or equal to a SCS configuration
![](media/image828.wmf) for any configured DL BWP or UL BWP. Each slot
provided by *pattern1* or *pattern2* is applicable to
![](media/image829.wmf) consecutive slots in the active DL BWP or the
active UL BWP where the first slot starts at a same time as a first slot
for the reference SCS configuration ![](media/image827.wmf) and each
downlink or flexible or uplink symbol for the reference SCS
configuration ![](media/image827.wmf) corresponds to
![](media/image830.wmf) consecutive downlink or flexible or uplink
symbols for the SCS configuration ![](media/image828.wmf).

If the UE is additionally provided *tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated*,
the parameter *tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated* overrides only flexible
symbols per slot over the number of slots as provided by
*tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon*.

The *tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated* provides

\- a set of slot configurations by
*slotSpecificConfigurationsToAddModList*

\- for each slot configuration from the set of slot configurations

\- a slot index for a slot provided by *slotIndex*

\- a set of symbols for a slot by *symbols* where

\- if *symbols* = *allDownlink*, all symbols in the slot are downlink

\- if *symbols* = *allUplink*, all symbols in the slot are uplink

\- if *symbols* = *explicit*, *nrofDownlinkSymbols* provides a number of
downlink first symbols in the slot and *nrofUplinkSymbols* provides a
number of uplink last symbols in the slot. If *nrofDownlinkSymbols* is
not provided, there are no downlink first symbols in the slot and if
*nrofUplinkSymbols* is not provided, there are no uplink last symbols in
the slot. The remaining symbols in the slot are flexible

For each slot having a corresponding index provided by *slotIndex*, the
UE applies a format provided by a corresponding *symbols*. The UE does
not expect *tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated* to indicate as uplink or
as downlink a symbol that *tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon* indicates as a
downlink or as an uplink symbol, respectively.

For each slot configuration provided by
*tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated*, a reference SCS configuration is the
reference SCS configuration
![](media/image831.wmf){width="0.25277777777777777in"
height="0.21944444444444444in"} provided by
*tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon*.

A slot configuration period and a number of downlink symbols, uplink
symbols, and flexible symbols in each slot of the slot configuration
period are determined from *tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon* and
*tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated* and are common to each configured
BWP.

A UE considers symbols in a slot indicated as downlink by
*tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon*, or *tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated*
to be available for receptions and considers symbols in a slot indicated
as uplink by *tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon*, or by
*tdd*-*UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated* to be available for transmissions.

If a UE is not configured to monitor PDCCH for DCI format 2\_0, for a
set of symbols of a slot that are indicated as flexible by
*tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon* and *tdd*-*UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated*
if provided, or when *tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon* and
*tdd*-*UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated* are not provided to the UE

\- the UE receives PDSCH or CSI-RS in the set of symbols of the slot if
the UE receives a corresponding indication by a DCI format

\- the UE transmits PUSCH, PUCCH, PRACH, or SRS in the set of symbols of
the slot if the UE receives a corresponding indication by a DCI format,
a RAR UL grant, fallbackRAR UL grant, or successRAR

For operation on a single carrier in unpaired spectrum, if a UE is
configured by higher layers to receive a PDCCH, or a PDSCH, or a CSI-RS,
or a DL PRS in a set of symbols of a slot, the UE receives the PDCCH,
the PDSCH, the CSI-RS, or the DL PRS if the UE does not detect a DCI
format that indicates to the UE to transmit a PUSCH, a PUCCH, a PRACH,
or a SRS in at least one symbol of the set of symbols of the slot;
otherwise, the UE does not receive the PDCCH, or the PDSCH, or the
CSI-RS, or the DL PRS in the set of symbols of the slot.

For operation with shared spectrum channel access, if a UE is provided
*csi-RS-ValidationWith-DCI*, is not provided *CO-DurationsPerCell*, and
is not provided *SlotFormatCombinationsPerCell*, and if the UE is
configured by higher layers to receive a CSI-RS in a set of symbols of
a slot, the UE cancels the CSI-RS reception in the set of symbols of the
slot if the UE does not detect a DCI format indicating an aperiodic
CSI-RS reception or scheduling a PDSCH reception in the set of symbols
of the slot.

If a UE is provided *channelAccessMode =\'dynamic\' and is provided
availableRB-SetsToAddModList* and *availableRB-SetsToReleaseList*, *the
UE expects to be provided co-DurationsPerCellToAddModList* and
*co-DurationsPerCellToReleaseList* and/or *slotFormatCombToAddModList*
and *slotFormatCombToReleaseList.*

For operation on a single carrier in unpaired spectrum, if a UE is
configured by higher layers to transmit SRS, or PUCCH, or PUSCH, or
PRACH in a set of symbols of a slot and the UE detects a DCI format
indicating to the UE to receive CSI-RS or PDSCH in a subset of symbols
from the set of symbols, then

\- If the UE does not indicate the capability of
\[partialCancellation\], the UE does not expect to cancel the
transmission of the PUCCH or PUSCH or PRACH in the set of symbols if the
first symbol in the set occurs within $T_{proc,2\ }$ relative to a last
symbol of a CORESET where the UE detects the DCI format; otherwise, the
UE cancels the PUCCH, or the PUSCH, or an actual repetition of the PUSCH
\[6, TS 38.214\], determined from clauses 9, 9.2.5 and 9.2.6 or clause
6.1 of \[6, TS 38.214\], or the PRACH transmission in the set of
symbols.

\- If the UE indicates the capability of \[partialCancellation\], the UE
does not expect to cancel the transmission of the PUCCH or PUSCH or
PRACH in symbols from the set of symbols that occur within $T_{proc,2}$
relative to a last symbol of a CORESET where the UE detects the DCI
format. The UE cancels the PUCCH, or the PUSCH, or an actual repetition
of the PUSCH \[6, TS 38.214\], determined from clauses 9, 9.2.5 and
9.2.6 or clause 6.1 of \[6, TS 38.214\], or the PRACH transmission in
remaining symbols from the set of symbols.

\- The UE does not expect to cancel the transmission of SRS in symbols
from the subset of symbols that occur within $T_{proc,2}$ relative to a
last symbol of a CORESET where the UE detects the DCI format. The UE
cancels the SRS transmission in remaining symbols from the subset of
symbols.

$T_{proc,2}$ is the PUSCH preparation time for the corresponding UE
processing capability \[6, TS 38.214\] assuming $d_{2,1} = 1$ and $\mu$
corresponds to the smallest SCS configuration between the SCS
configuration of the PDCCH carrying the DCI format and the SCS
configuration of the SRS, PUCCH, PUSCH or $\mu_{r}$, where $\mu_{r}$
corresponds to the SCS configuration of the PRACH if it is 15kHz or
higher; otherwise $\mu_{r} = 0$.

For a set of symbols of a slot that are indicated to a UE as uplink by
*tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon*, or *tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated*,
the UE does not receive PDCCH, PDSCH, or CSI-RS when the PDCCH, PDSCH,
or CSI-RS overlaps, even partially, with the set of symbols of the slot.

For a set of symbols of a slot that are indicated to a UE as uplink by
*tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon*, or *tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated*,
the UE does not receive DL PRS in the set of symbols of the slot, if the
UE is not provided with a measurement gap.

For a set of symbols of a slot that are indicated to a UE as downlink by
*tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon*, or *tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated*,
the UE does not transmit PUSCH, PUCCH, PRACH, or SRS when the PUSCH,
PUCCH, PRACH, or SRS overlaps, even partially, with the set of symbols
of the slot.

For a set of symbols of a slot that are indicated to a UE as flexible by
*tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon*, and *tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated*
if provided, the UE does not expect to receive both dedicated higher
layer parameters configuring transmission from the UE in the set of
symbols of the slot and dedicated higher layer parameters configuring
reception by the UE in the set of symbols of the slot.

For operation on a single carrier in unpaired spectrum, for a set of
symbols of a slot indicated to a UE by *ssb-PositionsInBurst* in *SIB1*
or *ssb-PositionsInBurst* in *ServingCellConfigCommon*, for reception of
SS/PBCH blocks, the UE does not transmit PUSCH, PUCCH, PRACH in the slot
if a transmission would overlap with any symbol from the set of symbols
and the UE does not transmit SRS in the set of symbols of the slot. The
UE does not expect the set of symbols of the slot to be indicated as
uplink by *tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon*, or
*tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated*, when provided to the UE.

If a UE

\- is configured with multiple serving cells and is provided with
*directionalCollisionHandling-r16* = \'enabled\' for a set of serving
cell(s) among the multiple serving cells, and

\- indicates support of *half-DuplexTDD-CA-SameSCS-r16* capability, and

\- is not configured to monitor PDCCH for detection of DCI format 2\_0
on any of the multiple serving cells,

for a set of symbols of a slot that are indicated to the UE for
reception of SS/PBCH blocks in a first cell of the multiple serving
cells by *ssb-PositionsInBurst* in *SystemInformationBlockType1* or by
*ssb-PositionsInBurst* in *ServingCellConfigCommon*, when provided to
the UE, the UE does not transmit PUSCH, PUCCH, or PRACH in the slot if a
transmission would overlap with any symbol from the set of symbols, and
the UE does not transmit SRS in the set of symbols of the slot in

\- any of the multiple serving cells if the UE is not capable of
simultaneous transmission and reception as indicated by
*simultaneousRxTxInterBandCA* among the multiple serving cells, and

\- any one of the cells corresponding to the same band as the first
cell, irrespective of any capability indicated by
*simultaneousRxTxInterBandCA*.

For a set of symbols of a slot corresponding to a valid PRACH occasion
and ![](media/image832.wmf) symbols before the valid PRACH occasion, as
described in clause 8.1, the UE does not receive PDCCH, PDSCH, or CSI-RS
in the slot if a reception would overlap with any symbol from the set of
symbols. The UE does not expect the set of symbols of the slot to be
indicated as downlink by *tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon* or
*tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated*.

For a set of symbols of a slot indicated to a UE by *pdcch-ConfigSIB1*
in *MIB* for a CORESET for Type0-PDCCH CSS set, the UE does not expect
the set of symbols to be indicated as uplink by
*tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon*, or *tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated*.

If a UE is scheduled by a DCI format to receive PDSCH over multiple
slots, and if *tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon*, or
*tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated*, indicate that, for a slot from the
multiple slots, at least one symbol from a set of symbols where the UE
is scheduled PDSCH reception in the slot is an uplink symbol, the UE
does not receive the PDSCH in the slot.

If a UE is scheduled by a DCI format to transmit PUSCH over multiple
slots, and if *tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon*, or
*tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated*, indicates that, for a slot from the
multiple slots, at least one symbol from a set of symbols where the UE
is scheduled PUSCH transmission in the slot is a downlink symbol, the UE
does not transmit the PUSCH in the slot.

If a UE

\- is configured with multiple serving cells and is provided with
*directionalCollisionHandling-r16* = \'enabled\' for a set of serving
cell(s) among the configured multiple serving cells, and

\- indicates support of *half-DuplexTDD-CA-SameSCS-r16* capability, and

\- is not configured to monitor PDCCH for detection of DCI format 2\_0
on any of the multiple serving cells,

the UE determines a reference cell for a symbol as an active cell with
the smallest cell index among

\- the configured multiple serving cells if the UE is not capable of
simultaneous transmission and reception as indicated by
*simultaneousRxTxInterBandCA* among the multiple serving cells, and

\- the cells of each band respectively if the UE is capable of
simultaneous transmission and reception by *simultaneousRxTxInterBandCA*
for the configured multiple serving cells,

where the symbol is configured as

\- downlink, or uplink, as indicated by *tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon*
or *tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated*

\- uplink, if the symbol is flexible and the UE is **configured to
transmit** SRS, PUCCH, PUSCH, or PRACH on the symbol

\- downlink, if the symbol is flexible and the UE is configured to
receive PDCCH, PDSCH or CSI-RS on the symbol.

And if another cell among the cells configured with
***directionalCollisionHandling-r16*** operates in the same frequency
band as the reference cell, the UE does not expect

\- a symbol to be indicated as downlink or uplink on the reference cell
and as uplink or downlink on another cell, respectively, by
*tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon* or by
*tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated*,

\- *tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon* or *tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated*
to indicate a symbol as downlink on the reference cell and to detect a
DCI format scheduling a transmission on the symbol on another cell, and

\- to be configured by **higher layers to receive** PDCCH, PDSCH, or
CSI-RS on a flexible symbol on the reference cell and to detect a DCI
format scheduling a transmission on the symbol on another cell,

if the reference cell and another cell among the cells configured with
***directionalCollisionHandling-r16*** operate in different frequency
bands,

the UE

\- assumes symbol as flexible, is not required to receive higher layer
configured PDCCH, PDSCH, or CSI-RS and not expected to transmit higher
layer configured SRS, PUCCH, PUSCH, or PRACH, when
*tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon* or *tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated*
indicates symbol as downlink or uplink on another cell and as uplink or
downlink for the reference cell, respectively,

\- transmits a signal/channel scheduled by a DCI format on a symbol of
another cell when the symbol is indicated as downlink by
*tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon* or *tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated*
for the reference cell,

\- is not required to receive a higher layer configured PDCCH, PDSCH, or
CSI-RS on flexible symbols on the reference cell in a set of symbols, if
the UE detects a DCI format scheduling a transmission on one or more
symbols in the set of symbols on another cell,

and regardless of whether the reference cell and another cell operate in
same or different frequency bands,

the UE

\- does not expect *tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon* or
*tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated* for the reference cell to indicate a
symbol as uplink and to detect a DCI format scheduling a reception on
the symbol on another cell

\- does not expect to be configured by higher layers to transmit SRS,
PUCCH, PUSCH, or PRACH on a flexible symbol on the reference cell and to
detect a DCI format scheduling a reception on the symbol on another cell

\- does not transmit a PUCCH, PUSCH or PRACH that is configured by
higher layers on a set of symbols on another cell if at least one symbol
from the set of symbols is indicated as downlink by
*tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon* or *tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated* or
is a symbol corresponding to a PDCCH, PDSCH, or CSI-RS reception that is
configured by higher layers on the reference cell

\- does not transmit a SRS that is configured by higher layers on a set
of symbols on another cell if the set of symbols is indicated as
downlink by *tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon* or
*tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated* or corresponds to a PDCCH, PDSCH or
CSI-RS reception that is configured by higher layers on the reference
cell

\- does not receive a PDCCH, PDSCH or CSI-RS that is configured by
higher layers on a set of symbols on another cell if at least one symbol
from the set of symbols is indicated as uplink by
*tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon* or *tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated* or
is a symbol corresponding to a SRS, PUCCH, PUSCH, or PRACH transmission
that is configured by higher layers on the reference cell

\- assumes a symbol indicated as downlink or uplink by
*tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon* or *tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated* on
another cell to be flexible, if the UE is respectively configured by
higher layers to transmit SRS, PUCCH, PUSCH, or PRACH or to receive
PDCCH, PDSCH, or CSI-RS on the reference cell

\- does not expect to detect a first DCI format scheduling a
transmission or reception on a symbol on a first cell and a second DCI
format scheduling a reception or transmission on the symbol on a second
cell, respectively.

After the UE applies the procedures described above for directional
collision handling within the set of cells that have been configured
with *directionalCollisionHandling-r16*, the UE does not expect any
directional collision among the serving cells that the UE is not capable
of simultaneous transmission and reception.

### 11.1.1 UE procedure for determining slot format

This clause applies for a serving cell that is included in a set of
serving cells configured to a UE by *slotFormatCombToAddModList* and
*slotFormatCombToReleaseList*, *availableRB-SetsToAddModList* and
*availableRB-SetsToReleaseList*, *switchTriggerToAddModList* and
*switchTriggerToReleaseList*, or *co-DurationsPerCellToAddModList* and
*co-DurationsPerCellToReleaseList*.

If a UE is configured by higher layers with parameter
*SlotFormatIndicator*, the UE is provided an SFI-RNTI by *sfi-RNTI* and
with a payload size of DCI format 2\_0 by *dci-PayloadSize*.

The UE is also provided in one or more serving cells with a
configuration for a search space set
![](media/image833.wmf){width="0.13541666666666666in"
height="0.13541666666666666in"} and a corresponding CORESET $p$ for
monitoring $M_{p,s}^{\left( L_{\text{SFI}} \right)}$ PDCCH candidates
for DCI format 2\_0 with a CCE aggregation level of $L_{\text{SFI}}$
CCEs as described in clause 10.1. The
$M_{p,s}^{\left( L_{\text{SFI}} \right)}$ PDCCH candidates are the first
$M_{p,s}^{\left( L_{\text{SFI}} \right)}$ PDCCH candidates *for CCE
aggregation level* $L_{\text{SFI}}$ for search space set $s$ in CORESET
$p$.

For each serving cell in the set of serving cells, the UE can be
provided:

\- an identity of the serving cell by *servingCellId*

\- a location of a SFI-index field in DCI format 2\_0 by *positionInDCI*

\- a set of slot format combinations by *slotFormatCombinations*, where
each slot format combination in the set of slot format combinations
includes

\- one or more slot formats indicated by a respective *slotFormats* for
the slot format combination, and

\- a mapping for the slot format combination provided by *slotFormats*
to a corresponding SFI-index field value in DCI format 2\_0 provided by
*slotFormatCombinationId*

\- for unpaired spectrum operation, a reference SCS configuration
$\mu_{\text{SFI}}$ by *subcarrierSpacing* and, when a supplementary UL
carrier is configured for the serving cell, a reference SCS
configuration $\mu_{SFI,SUL}$ by *subcarrierSpacing2* for the
supplementary UL carrier

\- for paired spectrum operation, a reference SCS configuration
$\mu_{SFI,DL}$ for a DL BWP by *subcarrierSpacing* and a reference SCS
configuration $\mu_{SFI,UL}$ for an UL BWP by *subcarrierSpacing2*

\- a location of an available RB set indicator field in DCI format 2\_0,
by *availableRB-SetsPerCell*, where the field is

\- one bit, if *intraCellGuardBandsDL-List* for the serving cell
indicates no intra-cell guard-bands are configured, where a value of
\'1\' indicates that the serving cell is available for receptions, a
value of \'0\' indicates that the serving cell is not available for
receptions, and the serving cell remains available or unavailable for
reception until the end of the remaining channel occupancy duration; or,

\- a bitmap having a one-to-one mapping with the RB sets \[6, TS
38.214\] of the serving cell, if *intraCellGuardBandsDL-List* for the
serving cell indicates intra-cell guard-bands are configured or if
*intraCellGuardBandsDL-List* is not provided for the serving cell, where
the bitmap includes $N_{RB,set,DL}$ bits and $N_{RB,set,DL}$ is the
number of RB sets in the serving cell, a value of \'1\' indicates that
an RB set is available for receptions, a value of \'0\' indicates that
an RB set is not available for receptions, *and a RB set remains
available or unavailable for receptions until the end of the* remaining
*channel occupancy duration*

\- a location of a channel occupancy duration field in DCI format 2\_0,
by *CO-DurationsPerCell*, where the field indicates a remaining channel
occupancy duration for the serving cell starting from a first symbol of
a slot where the UE detects the DCI format 2\_0 by providing a value
from *co-DurationList*. The channel occupancy duration field includes
$\max\left\{ \left\lceil \log_{2}\left( \text{COdurationListSize} \right) \right\rceil,1 \right\}$
bits, where $\text{COdurationListSize}$ is the number of values provided
by *co-DurationList*. If *CO-DurationsPerCell* is not provided, the
remaining channel occupancy duration for the serving cell is a number of
slots, starting from the slot where the UE detects the DCI format 2\_0,
that the SFI-index field value provides corresponding slot formats

\- a reference SCS configuration for *co-DurationList*, by
*subcarrierSpacing-r16*

\- a location of a search space set group switching flag field in DCI
format 2\_0, by *SearchSpaceSwitchTrigger*, where the field indicates a
group from two groups of search space sets for PDCCH monitoring for
scheduling for the serving cell or the set of serving cells, provided by
*CellGroupsForSwitching*, as described in clause 10.4.

If neither
*CO-DurationPerCell-r16* nor *SlotFormatCombinationsPerCell *are
provided and if *channelAccessMode* = *\"semiStatic\"* is provided, the
procedures in this clause apply with assuming a channel occupancy time
defined in clause 4.3 of \[15, TS 37.213\] is the remaining channel
occupancy duration if a DL transmission burst(s) is detected within the
channel occupancy time.

A SFI-index field value in a DCI format 2\_0 indicates to a UE a slot
format for each slot in a number of slots for each DL BWP or each UL BWP
starting from a slot where the UE detects the DCI format 2\_0. The
number of slots is equal to or larger than a PDCCH monitoring
periodicity for DCI format 2\_0. The SFI-index field includes
![](media/image834.wmf) bits where maxSFIindex is the maximum value of
the values provided by corresponding *slotFormatCombinationId*. A slot
format is identified by a corresponding format index as provided in
Table 11.1.1-1 where \'D\' denotes a downlink symbol, \'U\' denotes an
uplink symbol, and \'F\' denotes a flexible symbol.

If a PDCCH monitoring periodicity for DCI format 2\_0, provided to a UE
for the search space set ![](media/image835.wmf) by
*monitoringSlotPeriodicityAndOffset*, is smaller than a duration of a
slot format combination the UE obtains at a PDCCH monitoring occasion
for DCI format 2\_0 by a corresponding SFI-index field value, and the UE
detects more than one DCI formats 2\_0 indicating a slot format for a
slot, the UE expects each of the more than one DCI formats 2\_0 to
indicate a same format for the slot.

A UE does not expect to be configured to monitor PDCCH for DCI format
2\_0 on a second serving cell that uses larger SCS than the serving
cell.

For unpaired spectrum operation for a UE on a serving cell, the UE is
provided by *subcarrierSpacing* a reference SCS configuration
$\mu_{\text{SFI}}$ for each slot format in a combination of slot formats
indicated by an SFI-index field value in DCI format 2\_0. The UE expects
that for a reference SCS configuration $\mu_{\text{SFI}}$ and for an
active DL BWP or an active UL BWP with SCS configuration $\mu$, it is
$\mu \geq \mu_{\text{SFI}}$. Each slot format in the combination of slot
formats indicated by the SFI-index field value in DCI format 2\_0 is
applicable to $2^{\left( \mu - \mu_{\text{SFI}} \right)}$ consecutive
slots in the active DL BWP or the active UL BWP where the first slot
starts at a same time as a first slot for the reference SCS
configuration $\mu_{\text{SFI}}$ and each downlink or flexible or uplink
symbol for the reference SCS configuration
$\mu_{\text{SFI}}$ corresponds to ![](media/image836.wmf){width="0.5in"
height="0.19791666666666666in"} consecutive downlink or flexible or
uplink symbols for the SCS configuration $\mu$.

For paired spectrum operation for a UE on a serving cell, the SFI-index
field in DCI format 2\_0 indicates a combination of slot formats that
includes a combination of slot formats for a reference DL BWP and a
combination of slot formats for a reference UL BWP of the serving cell.
The UE is provided by *subcarrierSpacing* a reference SCS configuration
$\mu_{SFI,DL}$ for the combination of slot formats indicated by the
SFI-index field value in DCI format 2\_0 for the reference DL BWP of the
serving cell. The UE is provided by *subcarrierSpacing2* a reference SCS
configuration $\mu_{SFI,UL}$ for the combination of slot formats
indicated by the SFI-index field value in DCI format 2\_0 for the
reference UL BWP of the serving cell. If
$\mu_{SFI,DL} \geq \mu_{SFI,UL}$ and for each
$2^{\left( \mu_{SFI,DL} - \mu_{SFI,UL} \right)} + 1$ values provided by
a value of *slotFormats*, where the value of *slotFormats* is determined
by a value of *slotFormatCombinationId* in *slotFormatCombination* and
the value of *slotFormatCombinationId* is set by the value of the
SFI-index field value in DCI format 2\_0, the first
$2^{\left( \mu_{SFI,DL} - \mu_{SFI,UL} \right)}$ values for the
combination of slot formats are applicable to the reference DL BWP and
the next value is applicable to the reference UL BWP. If
$\mu_{SFI,DL} < \mu_{SFI,UL}$ and for each
$2^{\left( \mu_{SFI,UL} - \mu_{SFI,DL} \right)} + 1$ values provided by
*slotFormats*, the first value for the combination of slot formats is
applicable to the reference DL BWP and the next
$2^{\left( \mu_{SFI,UL} - \mu_{SFI,DL} \right)}$ values are applicable
to the reference UL BWP.

The UE is provided a reference SCS configuration $\mu_{SFI,DL}$ so that
for an active DL BWP with SCS configuration $\mu_{\text{DL}}$, it is
$\mu_{\text{DL}} \geq \mu_{SFI,DL}$. The UE is provided a reference SCS
configuration $\mu_{SFI,UL}$ so that for an active UL BWP with SCS
configuration $\mu_{\text{UL}}$, it is
$\mu_{\text{UL}} \geq \mu_{SFI,UL}$. Each slot format for a combination
of slot formats indicated by the SFI-index field value in DCI format
2\_0 for the reference DL BWP, by indicating a value for
*slotFormatCombinationId* that is mapped to a value of *slotFormats* in
*slotFormatCombination*, is applicable to
$2^{\left( \mu_{\text{DL}} - \mu_{SFI,DL} \right)}$ consecutive slots
for the active DL BWP where the first slot starts at a same time as a
first slot in the reference DL BWP and each downlink or flexible symbol
for the reference SCS configuration $\mu_{SFI,DL}$ corresponds to
$2^{\left( \mu_{\text{DL}} - \mu_{SFI,DL} \right)}$ consecutive downlink
or flexible symbols for the SCS configuration $\mu_{\text{DL}}$. Each
slot format for the combination of slot formats for the reference UL BWP
is applicable to $2^{\left( \mu_{\text{UL}} - \mu_{SFI,UL} \right)}$
consecutive slots for the active UL BWP where the first slot starts at a
same time as a first slot in the reference UL BWP and each uplink or
flexible symbol for the reference SCS configuration $\mu_{SFI,UL}$
corresponds to
$2^{\left( \mu_{\text{UL}} - \mu_{SFI,UL} \right)}$ consecutive uplink
or flexible symbols for the SCS configuration $\mu_{\text{UL}}$.

For unpaired spectrum operation with a second UL carrier for a UE on a
serving cell, the SFI-index field value in DCI format 2\_0 indicates a
combination of slot formats that includes a combination of slot formats
for a reference first UL carrier of the serving cell and a combination
of slot formats for a reference second UL carrier of the serving cell.
The UE is provided by *subcarrierSpacing* a reference SCS configuration
$\mu_{\text{SFI}}$ for the combination of slot formats indicated by the
SFI-index field in DCI format 2\_0 for the reference first UL carrier of
the serving cell. The UE is provided by *subcarrierSpacing2* a reference
SCS configuration $\mu_{SFI,SUL}$ for the combination of slot formats
indicated by the SFI-index field value in DCI format 2\_0 for the
reference second UL carrier of the serving cell. For each
$2^{\left( \mu_{\text{SFI}} - \mu_{SFI,SUL} \right)} + 1$ values of
*slotFormats*, the first
$2^{\left( \mu_{\text{SFI}} - \mu_{SFI,SUL} \right)}$ values for the
combination of slot formats are applicable to the reference first UL
carrier and the next value is applicable to the reference second UL
carrier.

The UE expects to be provided a reference SCS configuration
$\mu_{SFI,SUL}$ so that for an active UL BWP in the second UL carrier
with SCS configuration $\mu_{\text{SUL}}$, it is
$\mu_{\text{SUL}} \geq \mu_{SFI,SUL}$. Each slot format for a
combination of slot formats indicated by the SFI-index field in DCI
format 2\_0 for the reference first UL carrier is applicable to
$2^{\left( \mu - \mu_{\text{SFI}} \right)}$ consecutive slots for the
active DL BWP and the active UL BWP in the first UL carrier where the
first slot starts at a same time as a first slot in the reference first
UL carrier. Each slot format for the combination of slot formats for the
reference second UL carrier is applicable to
$2^{\left( \mu_{\text{SUL}} - \mu_{SFI,SUL} \right)}$ consecutive slots
for the active UL BWP in the second UL carrier where the first slot
starts at a same time as a first slot in the reference second UL
carrier.

If a BWP in the serving cell is configured with $\mu = 2$ and with
extended CP, the UE expects $\mu_{\text{SFI}} = 0$,
$\mu_{\text{SFI}} = 1$, or $\mu_{\text{SFI}} = 2$. A format for a slot
with extended CP is determined from a format for a slot with normal CP.
A UE determines an extended CP symbol to be a downlink/uplink/flexible
symbol if the overlapping normal CP symbols that are
downlink/uplink/flexible symbols, respectively. A UE determines an
extended CP symbol to be a flexible symbol if one of the overlapping
normal CP symbols is flexible. A UE determines an extended CP symbol to
be a flexible symbol if the pair of the overlapping normal CP symbols
includes a downlink and an uplink symbol.

A reference SCS configuration $\mu_{\text{SFI}}$, or $\mu_{SFI,DL}$, or
$\mu_{SFI,UL}$, or $\mu_{SFI,SUL}$ is either 0, or 1, or 2 for FR1 and
is either 2 or 3 for FR2.

For a set of symbols of a slot, a UE does not expect to detect a DCI
format 2\_0 with an SFI-index field value indicating the set of symbols
of the slot as uplink and to detect a DCI format indicating to the UE to
receive PDSCH or CSI-RS in the set of symbols of the slot.

For a set of symbols of a slot, a UE does not expect to detect a DCI
format 2\_0 with an SFI-index field value indicating the set of symbols
in the slot as downlink and to detect a DCI format, a RAR UL grant,
fallbackRAR UL grant, or successRAR indicating to the UE to transmit
PUSCH, PUCCH, PRACH, or SRS in the set of symbols of the slot.

For a set of symbols of a slot that are indicated by a DCI format 2\_0
as being within a remaining channel occupancy duration either by a
channel occupancy duration field or by an SFI-index field, a UE does not
expect to detect at a later time a DCI format 2\_0 indicating, either by
a channel occupancy duration field or by an SFI-index field, that any
symbol from the set of symbols is not within a remaining channel
occupancy duration.

For a set of symbols of a slot that are indicated as downlink/uplink by
*tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon*, or *tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated*,
the UE does not expect to detect a DCI format 2\_0 with an SFI-index
field value indicating the set of symbols of the slot as
uplink/downlink, respectively, or as flexible.

For a set of symbols of a slot corresponding to SS/PBCH blocks with
candidate SS/PBCH block indices corresponding to the SS/PBCH block
indexes indicated to a UE by *ssb-PositionsInBurst* in *SIB1,* or by
*ssb-PositionsInBurst* in *ServingCellConfigCommon*, as described in
clause 4.1, the UE does not expect to detect a DCI format 2\_0 with an
SFI-index field value indicating the set of symbols of the slot as
uplink.

For a set of symbols of a slot corresponding to a valid PRACH occasion
and $N_{\text{gap}}$ symbols before the valid PRACH occasion, as
described in clause 8.1, the UE does not expect to detect a DCI format
2\_0 with an SFI-index field value indicating the set of symbols of the
slot as downlink.

For a set of symbols of a slot indicated to a UE by *pdcch-ConfigSIB1*
in *MIB* for a CORESET for Type0-PDCCH CSS set, the UE does not expect
to detect a DCI format 2\_0 with an SFI-index field value indicating the
set of symbols of the slot as uplink.

For a set of symbols of a slot indicated to a UE as flexible by
*tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon* and *tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated*
if provided, or when *tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon* and
*tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated* are not provided to the UE, and if
the UE detects a DCI format 2\_0 providing a format for the slot using a
slot format value other than 255

\- if one or more symbols from the set of symbols are symbols in a
CORESET configured to the UE for PDCCH monitoring, the UE receives PDCCH
in the CORESET only if an SFI-index field value in DCI format 2\_0
indicates that the one or more symbols are downlink symbols

\- if an SFI-index field value in DCI format 2\_0 indicates the set of
symbols of the slot as flexible and the UE detects a DCI format
indicating to the UE to receive PDSCH or CSI-RS in the set of symbols of
the slot, the UE receives PDSCH or CSI-RS in the set of symbols of the
slot

symbols of the slot as flexible and the UE detects a DCI format, a RAR
UL grant, fallbackRAR UL grant, or successRAR indicating to the UE to
transmit PUSCH, PUCCH, PRACH, or SRS in the set of symbols of the slot

of the slot

\- if an SFI-index field value in DCI format 2\_0 indicates the set of
symbols of the slot as flexible, and the UE does not detect a DCI format
indicating to the UE to receive PDSCH or CSI-RS, or the UE does not
detect a DCI format, a RAR UL grant, fallbackRAR UL grant, or successRAR
indicating to the UE to transmit PUSCH, PUCCH, PRACH, or SRS in the set
of symbols of the slot, the UE does not transmit or receive in the set
of symbols of the slot

\- if the UE is configured by higher layers to receive PDSCH or CSI-RS
in the set of symbols of the slot, the UE receives the PDSCH or the
CSI-RS in the set of symbols of the slot only if an SFI-index field
value in DCI format 2\_0 indicates the set of symbols of the slot as
downlink and, if applicable, the set of symbols is within remaining
channel occupancy duration

\- if the UE is configured by higher layers to receive DL PRS in the set
of symbols of the slot, the UE receives the DL PRS in the set of symbols
of the slot only if an SFI-index field value in DCI format 2\_0
indicates the set of symbols of the slot as downlink or flexible.

\- if the UE is configured by higher layers to transmit PUCCH, or PUSCH,
or PRACH in the set of symbols of the slot, the UE transmits the PUCCH,
or the PUSCH, or the PRACH in the slot only if an SFI-index field value
in DCI format 2\_0 indicates the set of symbols of the slot as uplink

\- if the UE is configured by higher layers to transmit SRS in the set
of symbols of the slot, the UE transmits the SRS only in a subset of
symbols from the set of symbols of the slot indicated as uplink symbols
by an SFI-index field value in DCI format 2\_0

\- a UE does not expect to detect an SFI-index field value in DCI format
2\_0 indicating the set of symbols of the slot as downlink and also
detect a DCI format, a RAR UL grant, fallbackRAR UL grant, or successRAR
indicating to the UE to transmit SRS, PUSCH, PUCCH, or PRACH, in one or
more symbols from the set of symbols of the slot

\- a UE does not expect to detect an SFI-index field value in DCI format
2\_0 indicating the set of symbols of the slot as downlink or flexible
if the set of symbols of the slot includes symbols corresponding to any
repetition of a PUSCH transmission activated by an UL Type 2 grant PDCCH
as described in clause 10.2

\- a UE does not expect to detect an SFI-index field value in DCI format
2\_0 indicating the set of symbols of the slot as uplink and also detect
a DCI format indicating to the UE to receive PDSCH or CSI-RS in one or
more symbols from the set of symbols of the slot

If a UE is configured by higher layers to receive a CSI-RS or a PDSCH in
a set of symbols of a slot and the UE detects a DCI format 2\_0 with a
slot format value other than 255 that indicates a slot format with a
subset of symbols from the set of symbols as uplink or flexible, or the
UE detects a DCI format indicating to the UE to transmit PUSCH, PUCCH,
SRS, or PRACH in at least one symbol in the set of the symbols, the UE
cancels the CSI-RS reception in the set of symbols of the slot or
cancels the PDSCH reception in the slot.

For operation with shared spectrum channel access, if a UE is configured
by higher layers to receive a CSI-RS and the UE is provided
*CO-DurationsPerCell*, for a set of symbols of a slot that are indicated
as downlink or flexible by *tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon* or
*tdd*-*UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated*, or when
*tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon* and *tdd*-*UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated*
are not provided, the UE cancels the CSI-RS reception in the set of
symbols of the slot that are not within the remaining channel occupancy
duration.

If a UE is configured by higher layers to receive a DL PRS in a set of
symbols of a slot and the UE detects a DCI format 2\_0 with a slot
format value other than 255 that indicates a slot format with a subset
of symbols from the set of symbols as uplink, or the UE detects a DCI
format indicating to the UE to transmit PUSCH, PUCCH, SRS, or PRACH in
at least one symbol in the set of the symbols, the UE cancels the DL PRS
reception in the set of symbols of the slot.

If a UE is configured by higher layers to transmit SRS, or PUCCH, or
PUSCH, or PRACH in a set of symbols of a slot and the UE detects a DCI
format 2\_0 with a slot format value other than 255 that indicates a
slot format with a subset of symbols from the set of symbols as downlink
or flexible, or the UE detects a DCI format indicating to the UE to
receive CSI-RS or PDSCH in a subset of symbols from the set of symbols,
then

\- If the UE indicates the capability of \[partialCancellation\], the UE
does not expect to cancel the transmission of the PUCCH or PUSCH or
PRACH in symbols from the set of symbols that occur within $T_{proc,2}$
relative to a last symbol of a CORESET where the UE detects the DCI
format. The UE cancels the PUCCH, or the PUSCH, or an actual repetition
of the PUSCH \[6, TS 38.214\], determined from clauses 9, 9.2.5 and
9.2.6 or clause 6.1 of \[6, TS 38.214\], or the PRACH transmission in
remaining symbols from the set of symbols.

\- The UE does not expect to cancel the transmission of SRS in symbols
from the subset of symbols that occur within $T_{proc,2}$ relative to a
last symbol of a CORESET where the UE detects the DCI format. The UE
cancels the SRS transmission in remaining symbols from the subset of
symbols.

$T_{proc,2}$ is the PUSCH preparation time for the corresponding UE
processing capability \[6, TS 38.214\] assuming $d_{2,1} = 1$ and $\mu$
corresponds to the smallest SCS configuration between the SCS
configuration of the PDCCH carrying the DCI format and the SCS
configuration of the SRS, PUCCH, PUSCH or $\mu_{r}$, where $\mu_{r}$
corresponds to the SCS configuration of the PRACH if it is 15kHz or
higher; otherwise $\mu_{r} = 0$.

If a UE is configured by higher layers to receive a CSI-RS or detects a
DCI format 0\_1 indicating to the UE to receive a CSI-RS in one or more
RB sets and a set of symbols of a slot, and the UE detects a DCI format
2\_0 with bitmap indicating that any RB set from the one or more RB sets
is not available for reception, the UE cancels the CSI-RS reception in
the set of symbols of the slot.

A UE assumes that flexible symbols in a CORESET configured to the UE for
PDCCH monitoring are downlink symbols if the UE does not detect an
SFI-index field value in DCI format 2\_0 indicating the set of symbols
of the slot as flexible or uplink and the UE does not detect a DCI
format indicating to the UE to transmit SRS, PUSCH, PUCCH, or PRACH in
the set of symbols.

For a set of symbols of a slot that are indicated as flexible by
*tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon*, and *tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated*
if provided, or when *tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon*, and
*tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated* are not provided to the UE, and if
the UE does not detect a DCI format 2\_0 providing a slot format for the
slot

\- the UE receives PDSCH or CSI-RS in the set of symbols of the slot if
the UE receives a corresponding indication by a DCI format

\- the UE transmits PUSCH, PUCCH, PRACH, or SRS in the set of symbols of
the slot if the UE receives a corresponding indication by a DCI format,
a RAR UL grant, fallbackRAR UL grant, or successRAR

\- the UE receives PDCCH as described in clause 10.1

\- if the UE is configured by higher layers to receive PDSCH in the set
of symbols of the slot, the UE does not receive the PDSCH in the set of
symbols of the slot

\- if the UE is configured by higher layers to receive CSI-RS in the set
of symbols of the slot, the UE does not receive the CSI-RS in the set of
symbols of the slot, except when UE is provided *CO-DurationsPerCell*
and the set of symbols of the slot are within the remaining channel
occupancy duration.

\- if the UE is configured by higher layers to receive DL PRS in the set
of symbols of the slot, the UE receives the DL PRS

\- if the UE is configured by higher layers to transmit SRS, or PUCCH,
or PUSCH, or PRACH in the set of symbols of the slot and the UE is not
provided *enableConfiguredUL*, then

\- if the UE does not indicate the capability of
\[partialCancellation\], the UE does not expect to cancel the

PUSCH \[6, TS 38.214\], as determined in clauses 9, 9.2.5 and 9.2.6 or
in clause 6.1 of \[6. TS 38.214\], or the PRACH in the slot if the first
symbol of the PUCCH or the PUSCH or actual repetition of the PUSCH or
the PRACH in the slot occurs within $T_{proc,2}$ relative to a last
symbol of a CORESET where the UE is configured to monitor PDCCH for DCI
format 2\_0; otherwise, the UE cancels the PUCCH, or the PUSCH, or an
actual repetition of the PUSCH \[6, TS 38.214\], as determined in

clauses 9, 9.2.5 and 9.2.6 or in clause 6.1 of \[6. TS 38.214\], or the
PRACH in symbols from the set of symbols that occur within $T_{proc,2}$
relative to a last symbol of a CORESET where the UE is configured to
monitor PDCCH for DCI format 2\_0. The UE cancels the PUCCH, or the
PUSCH, or an actual repetition of the PUSCH \[6, TS 38.214\], as
determined in clauses 9, 9.2.5 and 9.2.6 or in clause 6.1 of \[6. TS
38.214\], or the PRACH transmission in remaining symbols from the set of
symbols;

\- the UE does not expect to cancel the transmission of SRS
in symbols from the set of symbols that occur within
$T_{proc,2}\ $relative to a last symbol of a CORESET where the UE is
configured to monitor PDCCH for DCI format 2\_0. The UE cancels the SRS
transmission in remaining symbols from the set of symbols;

\- $T_{proc,2}$ is the PUSCH preparation time for the corresponding UE
processing capability \[6, TS 38.214\] assuming $d_{2,1} = 1$ and $\mu$
corresponds to the smallest SCS configuration between the SCS
configuration of the PDCCH carrying the DCI format 2\_0 and the SCS
configuration of the SRS, PUCCH, PUSCH or $\mu_{r}$, where $\mu_{r}$
corresponds to the SCS configuration of the PRACH if it is 15kHz or
higher; otherwise $\mu_{r} = 0$;

\- if the UE is configured by higher layers to transmit SRS, or PUCCH,
or PUSCH, or PRACH in the set of symbols of the slot and the UE is
provided *enableConfiguredUL*, the UE can transmit the SRS, or PUCCH, or
PUSCH, or PRACH, respectively.

For unpaired spectrum operation for a UE on a cell in a frequency band
of FR1, and when the scheduling restrictions due to RRM measurements
\[10, TS 38.133\] are not applicable, if the UE detects a DCI format
indicating to the UE to transmit in a set of symbols, the UE is not
required to perform RRM measurements \[10, TS 38.133\] based on a
SS/PBCH block or CSI-RS reception on a different cell in the frequency
band if the SS/PBCH block or CSI-RS reception includes at least one
symbol from the set of symbols.

11.2 Interrupted transmission indication 
----------------------------------------

If a UE is provided *DownlinkPreemption*, the UE is configured with an
INT-RNTI provided by *int-RNTI* for monitoring PDCCH conveying DCI
format 2\_1 \[5, TS 38.212\]. The UE is additionally configured with

\- a set of serving cells by *int-ConfigurationPerServingCell* that
includes a set of serving cell indexes provided by corresponding
*servingCellId* and a corresponding set of locations for fields in DCI
format 2\_1 by *positionInDCI*

\- an information payload size for DCI format 2\_1 by *dci-PayloadSize*

\- an indication granularity for time-frequency resources by
*timeFrequencySet*

If a UE detects a DCI format 2\_1 for a serving cell from the configured
set of serving cells, the UE may assume that no transmission to the UE
is present in PRBs and in symbols that are indicated by the DCI format
2\_1, from a set of PRBs and a set of symbols of the last monitoring
period. The indication by the DCI format 2\_1 is not applicable to
receptions of SS/PBCH blocks.

The set of PRBs is equal to the active DL BWP as defined in clause 12
and includes ![](media/image837.wmf) PRBs.

If a UE detects a DCI format 2\_1 in a PDCCH transmitted in a CORESET in
a slot, the set of symbols is the last ![](media/image838.wmf) symbols
prior to the first symbol of the CORESET in the slot where
![](media/image839.wmf) is the PDCCH monitoring periodicity provided by
the value of *monitoringSlotPeriodicityAndOffset,* as described in
clause 10.1, ![](media/image840.wmf) is the number of symbols per slot,
![](media/image841.wmf) is the SCS configuration for a serving cell with
mapping to a respective field in the DCI format 2\_1,
![](media/image842.wmf) is the SCS configuration of the DL BWP where the
UE receives the PDCCH with the DCI format 2\_1. If the UE is provided
*tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon*, symbols indicated as uplink by
*tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon* are excluded from the last
![](media/image843.wmf) symbols prior to the first symbol of the CORESET
in the slot. The resulting set of symbols includes a number of symbols
that is denoted as ![](media/image844.wmf).

The UE does not expect to be provided values of ![](media/image841.wmf),
![](media/image845.wmf), and ![](media/image839.wmf) resulting to a
value of ![](media/image846.wmf) that is not an integer. The UE does not
expect to be configured by *monitoringSymbolsWithinSlot* with more than
one PDCCH monitoring occasion for DCI format 2\_1 in a slot.

A UE is provided the indication granularity for the set of PRBs and for
the set of symbols by *timeFrequencySet*.

If the value of *timeFrequencySet* is \'set0\', 14 bits from MSB of a
field in DCI format 2\_1 have a one-to-one mapping with 14 groups of
consecutive symbols from the set of symbols where each of the first
![](media/image847.wmf) symbol groups includes ![](media/image848.wmf)
symbols, each of the last ![](media/image849.wmf) symbol groups includes
![](media/image850.wmf) symbols, a bit value of 0 indicates transmission
to the UE in the corresponding symbol group and a bit value of 1
indicates no transmission to the UE in the corresponding symbol group.

If the value of *timeFrequencySet* is \'set1\', 7 pairs of bits from MSB
of a field in the DCI format 2\_1 have a one-to-one mapping with 7
groups of consecutive symbols where each of the first
![](media/image851.wmf) symbol groups includes ![](media/image852.wmf)
symbols, each of the last ![](media/image853.wmf) symbol groups includes
![](media/image854.wmf) symbols, a first bit in a pair of bits for a
symbol group is applicable to the subset of first
![](media/image855.wmf) PRBs from the set of ![](media/image837.wmf)
PRBs, a second bit in the pair of bits for the symbol group is
applicable to the subset of last ![](media/image856.wmf) PRBs from the
set of ![](media/image837.wmf) PRBs, a bit value of 0 indicates
transmission to the UE in the corresponding symbol group and subset of
PRBs, and a bit value of 1 indicates no transmission to the UE in the
corresponding symbol group and subset of PRBs.

11.2A Cancellation indication
-----------------------------

If a UE is provided *UplinkCancellation*, the UE is provided, in one or
more serving cells, a search space set for monitoring the first PDCCH
candidate with a CCE aggregation level of $L_{\text{CI}}$ CCEs of the
search space set for detection of a DCI format 2\_4 \[5, TS 38.212\]
with a CI-RNTI provided by *ci-RNTI* as described in clause 10.1.
*UplinkCancellation* additionally provides to the UE

\- a set of serving cells, by *ci-ConfigurationPerServingCell,* that
includes a set of serving cell indexes and a corresponding set of
locations for fields in DCI format 2\_4 by *positionInDCI*

\- a number of fields in DCI format 2\_4, by *positionInDCI-forSUL*, for
each serving cell for a SUL carrier, if the serving cell is configured
with a SUL carrier

\- an information payload size for DCI format 2\_4 by
*dci-PayloadSize-ForCI*

\- an indication for time-frequency resources by *timeFrequencyRegion*

For a serving cell having an associated field in a DCI format 2\_4, for
the field denote by

\- $N_{\text{CI}}$ a number of bits provided by *ci-PayloadSize*

\- $B_{\text{CI}}$ a number of PRBs provided by *frequencyRegionforCI*
in *timeFrequencyRegion*

\- $T_{\text{CI}}$ a number of symbols, excluding symbols for reception
of SS/PBCH blocks and DL symbols indicated by
*tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon*, from a number of symbols that

\- is provided by *timeDurationforCI* in *timeFrequencyRegion,* if the
PDCCH monitoring periodicity for the search space set with the DCI
format 2\_4 is one slot and there are more than one PDCCH monitoring
occasions in a slot, or

\- is equal to the PDCCH monitoring periodicity, otherwise.

\- $G_{\text{CI}}$ a number of partitions for the $T_{\text{CI}}$
symbols provided by *timeGranularityforCI* in *timeFrequencyRegion*

$G_{\text{CI}}$ sets of bits from the MSB of the $N_{\text{CI}}$ bits
have a one-to-one mapping with $G_{\text{CI}}$ groups of symbols where
each of the first
$G_{\text{CI}} - T_{\text{CI}} + \left\lfloor \frac{T_{\text{CI}}}{G_{\text{CI}}} \right\rfloor \cdot G_{\text{CI}}$
groups includes
$\left\lfloor \frac{T_{\text{CI}}}{G_{\text{CI}}} \right\rfloor$ symbols
and each of the remaining
$T_{\text{CI}} - \left\lfloor \frac{T_{\text{CI}}}{G_{\text{CI}}} \right\rfloor \cdot G_{\text{CI}}$
groups includes
$\left\lceil \frac{T_{\text{CI}}}{G_{\text{CI}}} \right\rceil$ symbols.
A UE determines a symbol duration with respect to a SCS configuration of
an active DL BWP where the UE monitors PDCCH for DCI format 2\_4
detection.

For a group of symbols,
$N_{\text{BI}} = \frac{N_{\text{CI}}}{G_{\text{CI}}}$ bits from MSB of
each set of bits have a one-to-one mapping with $N_{\text{BI}}$ groups
of PRBs where each of the first
$N_{\text{BI}} - B_{\text{CI}} + \left\lfloor \frac{B_{\text{CI}}}{N_{\text{BI}}} \right\rfloor \cdot N_{\text{BI}}$
groups includes
$\left\lfloor \frac{B_{\text{CI}}}{N_{\text{BI}}} \right\rfloor$ PRBs
and each of the remaining
$B_{\text{CI}} - \left\lfloor \frac{B_{\text{CI}}}{N_{\text{BI}}} \right\rfloor \cdot N_{\text{BI}}$
groups includes
$\left\lceil \frac{B_{\text{CI}}}{N_{\text{BI}}} \right\rceil$ PRBs. A
UE determines a first PRB index as
${N_{\text{RFR}}^{\text{start}} = O}_{\text{carrier}} + \text{RB}_{\text{start}}$
and a number of contiguous RBs as ${B_{\text{CI}} = L}_{\text{RB}}\ $
from *frequencyRegionforCI* that indicates an offset
$\text{RB}_{\text{start}}$ and a length $L_{\text{RB}}$ as RIV according
to \[6, TS 38.214\], and from *offsetToCarrier* in *FrequencyInfoUL-SIB*
or *FrequencyInfoUL* that indicates $O_{\text{carrier}}$ for a SCS
configuration of an active DL BWP where the UE monitors PDCCH for DCI
format 2\_4 detection.

An indication by a DCI format 2\_4 for a serving cell is applicable to a
PUSCH transmission or an SRS transmission on the serving cell. If the
PUSCH transmission or the SRS transmission is scheduled by a DCI format,
the indication by the DCI format 2\_4 is applicable to the PUSCH
transmission or SRS transmission only if the last symbol of the PDCCH
reception providing the DCI format is earlier than the first symbol of
the PDCCH reception providing the DCI format 2\_4. For the serving cell,
the UE determines the first symbol of the $T_{\text{CI}}$ symbols to be
the first symbol that is after ${T'}_{proc,2}$ from the end of a PDCCH
reception where the UE detects the DCI format 2\_4, where
${T'}_{proc,2}$ is obtained from $T_{proc,2}$ for PUSCH processing
capability 2 \[6, TS 38.214\] assuming
$d_{2,1} = d_{\text{offset}} \cdot \frac{2^{- \mu_{\text{UL}}}}{2^{- \mu}}$
where $d_{\text{offset}}$ is provided by *delta\_Offset*, $\mu$ being
the smallest SCS configuration between the SCS configuration of the
PDCCH and the smallest *SCS configuration* $\mu_{\text{UL}}$ *provided
in scs-SpecificCarrierList of FrequencyInfoUL or FrequencyInfoUL-SIB*.
The UE does not expect to cancel the PUSCH transmission or the SRS
transmission before a corresponding symbol that is $T_{proc,2}$ assuming
that $d_{2,1} = 0$ after a last symbol of a CORESET where the UE detects
the DCI format 2\_4.

A UE that detects a DCI format 2\_4 for a serving cell cancels a PUSCH
transmission or an actual repetition of a PUSCH transmission \[6, TS
38.214\] if the PUSCH transmission is with repetition Type B, as
determined in clauses 9 and 9.2.5 or in clause 6.1 of \[6, TS 38.214\],
or an SRS transmission on the serving cell if, respectively,

\- the transmission is PUSCH with priority 0, if the UE is provided
*uplinkCancellationPriority*,

\- a group of symbols, from the $T_{\text{CI}}$ symbols, has at least
one bit value of \'1\' in the corresponding set of $N_{\text{BI}}$ bits
in the DCI format 2\_4 and includes a symbol of the (repetition of the)
PUSCH transmission or of the SRS transmission, and

\- a group of PRBs, from the $B_{\text{CI}}$ PRBs, has a corresponding
bit value of \'1\' in the set of bits corresponding to the group of
symbols in the DCI format 2\_4 and includes a PRB of the (repetition of
the) PUSCH transmission or of the SRS transmission,

where

\- the cancellation of the (repetition of the) PUSCH transmission
includes all symbols from the earliest symbol of the (repetition of the)
PUSCH transmission that is in a group of symbols having corresponding
bit values of \'1\' in the DCI format 2\_4;

\- the cancellation of the SRS transmission includes only symbols that
are in one or more groups of symbols having corresponding bit values of
\'1\' in the DCI format 2\_4.

If, based on an indication by a DCI format 2\_4, a UE cancels a PUSCH
transmission or an SRS transmission, the UE does not expect to be
scheduled by a second DCI format to transmit a PUSCH or an SRS over
symbols that include symbols of the cancelled PUSCH transmission or SRS
transmission, where the last symbol of the PDCCH reception providing the
second DCI format is no earlier than the first symbol of the PDCCH
reception providing the DCI format 2\_4.

11.3 Group TPC commands for PUCCH/PUSCH
---------------------------------------

For PUCCH transmission on a serving cell, a UE can be provided

\- a TPC-PUCCH-RNTI for a DCI format 2\_2 by *tpc-PUCCH-RNTI*

cell in DCI format 2\_2 if the UE indicates a capability to support two
PUSCH power control adjustment states, by *twoDifferentTPC-Loop-PUSCH*,
and if the UE is configured for two PUSCH power control adjustment
states by *twoPUSCH-PC-AdjustmentStates*

The UE is also provided for the serving cell of the PDCCH reception for
DCI format 2\_2 with a configuration for a search space set
![](media/image862.wmf) and a corresponding CORESET
![](media/image863.wmf) for monitoring PDCCH candidates for DCI format
2\_2 with CRC scrambled by a TPC-PUSCH-RNTI as described in clause 10.1.

11.4 SRS switching
------------------

DCI format 2\_3 is applicable for uplink carrier(s) of serving cells
where a UE is not configured for PUSCH/PUCCH transmission or for uplink
carrier(s) of a serving cell where *srs-PowerControlAdjustmentStates*
indicates a separate power control adjustment state between SRS
transmissions and PUSCH transmissions.

12 Bandwidth part operation 
===========================

If the UE is configured with a SCG, the UE shall apply the procedures
described in this clause for both MCG and SCG

\- When the procedures are applied for MCG, the terms \'secondary
cell\', \'secondary cells\' , \'serving cell\', \'serving cells\' in
this clause refer to secondary cell, secondary cells, serving cell,
serving cells belonging to the MCG respectively.

\- When the procedures are applied for SCG, the terms \'secondary
cell\', \'secondary cells\', \'serving cell\', \'serving cells\' in this
clause refer to secondary cell, secondary cells (not including PSCell),
serving cell, serving cells belonging to the SCG respectively. The term
\'primary cell\' in this clause refers to the PSCell of the SCG.

A UE configured for operation in bandwidth parts (BWPs) of a serving
cell, is configured by higher layers for the serving cell a set of at
most four bandwidth parts (BWPs) for receptions by the UE (DL BWP set)
in a DL bandwidth by parameter *BWP-Downlink* or by parameter
*initialDownlinkBWP* with a set of parameters configured by
*BWP-DownlinkCommon* and *BWP-DownlinkDedicated*, and a set of at most
four BWPs for transmissions by the UE (UL BWP set) in an UL bandwidth by
parameter *BWP-Uplink* or by parameter *initialUplinkBWP* with a set of
parameters configured by *BWP-UplinkCommon* and *BWP-UplinkDedicated*.

For operation with shared spectrum channel access, a UE expects that the
BWP configured by the parameter *initialUplinkBWP* provided in
*UplinkConfigCommonSIB* is mapped to only a single RB set.

If a UE is not provided *initialDownlinkBWP*, an initial DL BWP is
defined by a location and number of contiguous PRBs, starting from a PRB
with the lowest index and ending at a PRB with the highest index among
PRBs of a CORESET for Type0-PDCCH CSS set, and a SCS and a cyclic prefix
for PDCCH reception in the CORESET for Type0-PDCCH CSS set; otherwise,
the initial DL BWP is provided by *initialDownlinkBWP*. For operation on
the primary cell or on a secondary cell, a UE is provided an initial UL
BWP by *initialUplinkBWP*. If the UE is configured with a supplementary
UL carrier, the UE can be provided an initial UL BWP on the
supplementary UL carrier by *initialUplinkBWP*.

If a UE has dedicated BWP configuration, the UE can be provided by
*firstActiveDownlinkBWP-Id* a first active DL BWP for receptions and by
*firstActiveUplinkBWP-Id* a first active UL BWP for transmissions on a
carrier of the primary cell.

For each DL BWP or UL BWP in a set of DL BWPs or UL BWPs, respectively,
the UE is provided the following parameters for the serving cell as
defined in \[4, TS 38.211\] or \[6, TS 38.214\]:

\- a SCS by *subcarrierSpacing*

\- a cyclic prefix by *cyclicPrefix*

\- a common RB ![](media/image864.wmf) and a number of contiguous RBs
![](media/image865.wmf) provided by *locationAndBandwidth* that
indicates an offset ![](media/image866.wmf) and a length
![](media/image867.wmf) as RIV according to \[6, TS 38.214\], setting
![](media/image868.wmf), and a value ![](media/image869.wmf) provided by
*offsetToCarrier* for the *subcarrierSpacing*

\- an index in the set of DL BWPs or UL BWPs by respective *BWP-Id*

\- a set of BWP-common and a set of BWP-dedicated parameters by
*BWP-DownlinkCommon* and *BWP-DownlinkDedicated* for the DL BWP, or
*BWP-UplinkCommon* and *BWP-UplinkDedicated* for the UL BWP \[12, TS
38.331\]

For unpaired spectrum operation, a DL BWP from the set of configured DL
BWPs with index provided by *BWP-Id* is linked with an UL BWP from the
set of configured UL BWPs with index provided by *BWP-Id* when the DL
BWP index and the UL BWP index are same. For unpaired spectrum
operation, a UE does not expect to receive a configuration where the
center frequency for a DL BWP is different than the center frequency for
an UL BWP when the *BWP-Id* of the DL BWP is same as the *BWP-Id* of the
UL BWP.

For each DL BWP in a set of DL BWPs of the PCell, a UE can be configured
CORESETs for every type of CSS sets and for USS as described in clause
10.1. The UE does not expect to be configured without a CSS set on the
PCell in the active DL BWP.

If a UE is provided *controlResourceSetZero* and *searchSpaceZero* in
*PDCCH-ConfigSIB1 or PDCCH-ConfigCommon, the UE determines a CORESET for
a* search space set from *controlResourcesetZero* as described in clause
13 and for Tables 13-1 through 13-10, and determines corresponding PDCCH
monitoring occasions as described in clause 13 and for Tables 13-11
through 13-15. If the active DL BWP is not the initial DL BWP, t*he UE*
determines PDCCH monitoring occasions *for the* search space set only if
the CORESET bandwidth *is within the active DL BWP and the active DL BWP
has same SCS configuration and same cyclic prefix as the initial DL
BWP*.

For each UL BWP in a set of UL BWPs of the PCell or of the PUCCH-SCell,
the UE is configured resource sets for PUCCH transmissions as described
in clause 9.2.1.

A UE receives PDCCH and PDSCH in a DL BWP according to a configured SCS
and CP length for the DL BWP. A UE transmits PUCCH and PUSCH in an UL
BWP according to a configured SCS and CP length for the UL BWP.

If a bandwidth part indicator field is configured in a DCI format, the
bandwidth part indicator field value indicates the active DL BWP, from
the configured DL BWP set, for DL receptions as described in \[5, TS
38.212\]. If a bandwidth part indicator field is configured in a DCI
format, the bandwidth part indicator field value indicates the active UL
BWP, from the configured UL BWP set, for UL transmissions as described
in \[5, TS 38.212\]. If a bandwidth part indicator field is configured
in a DCI format and indicates an UL BWP or a DL BWP different from the
active UL BWP or DL BWP, respectively, the UE shall

\- for each information field in the DCI format

\- if the size of the information field is smaller than the one required
for the DCI format interpretation for the UL BWP or DL BWP that is
indicated by the bandwidth part indicator, the UE prepends zeros to the
information field until its size is the one required for the
interpretation of the information field for the UL BWP or DL BWP prior
to interpreting the DCI format information fields, respectively

\- if the size of the information field is larger than the one required
for the DCI format interpretation for the UL BWP or DL BWP that is
indicated by the bandwidth part indicator, the UE uses a number of least
significant bits of the DCI format equal to the one required for the UL
BWP or DL BWP indicated by bandwidth part indicator prior to
interpreting the DCI format information fields, respectively

\- set the active UL BWP or DL BWP to the UL BWP or DL BWP indicated by
the bandwidth part indicator in the DCI format

If a bandwidth part indicator field is configured in a DCI format 0\_1
and indicates an active UL BWP with different SCS configuration $\mu$*,*
or with different number $N_{RB - set,UL}^{\text{BWP}}$ of RB sets, than
a current active UL BWP, the UE determines an uplink frequency domain
resource allocation Type 2 based on $X'$ bits and $Y'$ bits that are
generated by independently truncating or padding the $X$ MSBs and the
$Y$ LSBs \[6, TS 38.214\] of the frequency domain resource assignment
field of DCI format 0\_1, where truncation starts from the MSBs of the X
bits or the Y bits, zero-padding prepends zeros to the X bits or the Y
bits, and

\- if the indicated active UL BWP has SCS configuration $\mu = 1$ and
the current active BWP has SCS configuration $\mu = 0$*,* the $X$ MSBs
are truncated to $X^{'} = X - 1$ bits, or

\- if the indicated active UL BWP has SCS configuration $\mu = 0$ and
the current active BWP has SCS configuration $\mu = 1$, the $X$ MSBs are
zero-padded to $X^{'} = X + 1$ bits

\- otherwise, the $X$ MSBs are unchanged

and

\- the $Y$ LSBs are truncated or zero-padded to
$Y' = \left\lceil \text{log}_{2}\left( \frac{N_{RB - set,UL}^{\text{BWP}}\left( N_{RB - set,UL}^{\text{BWP}} + 1 \right)}{2} \right) \right\rceil$
bits where $N_{RB - set,UL}^{\text{BWP}}$ is a number of RB sets
configured for the indicated active UL BWP

A UE does not expect to detect a DCI format with a BWP indicator field
that indicates an active DL BWP or an active UL BWP change with the
corresponding time domain resource assignment field providing a slot
offset value for a PDSCH reception or PUSCH transmission that is smaller
than a delay required by the UE for an active DL BWP change or UL BWP
change, respectively \[10, TS 38.133\].

If a UE detects a DCI format with a BWP indicator field that indicates
an active DL BWP change for a cell, the UE is not required to receive or
transmit in the cell during a time duration from the end of the third
symbol of a slot where the UE receives the PDCCH that includes the DCI
format in a scheduling cell until the beginning of a slot indicated by
the slot offset value of the time domain resource assignment field in
the DCI format.

If a UE detects a DCI format with SCell dormancy indication that
indicates an active DL BWP change for an Scell in slot *n* of primary
cell, the UE is not required to receive or transmit in the SCell during
a time duration specified in \[10, TS 38.133\].

If a UE detects a DCI format indicating an active UL BWP change for a
cell, the UE is not required to receive or transmit in the cell during a
time duration from the end of the third symbol of a slot where the UE
receives the PDCCH that includes the DCI format in the scheduling cell
until the beginning of a slot indicated by the slot offset value of the
time domain resource assignment field in the DCI format.

A UE does not expect to detect a DCI format indicating an active DL BWP
change or an active UL BWP change for a scheduled cell within FR1 (or
FR2) in a slot other than the first slot of a set of slots for the DL
SCS of the scheduling cell that overlaps with a time duration where the
UE is not required to receive or transmit, respectively, for an active
BWP change in a different cell from the scheduled cell within FR1 (or
FR2).

A UE expects to detect a DCI format with a BWP indicator field that
indicates an active UL BWP change or an active DL BWP change only if a
corresponding PDCCH is received within the first 3 symbols of a slot.

For a serving cell, a UE can be provided by *defaultDownlinkBWP-Id* a
default DL BWP among the configured DL BWPs. If a UE is not provided a
default DL BWP by *defaultDownlinkBWP-Id*, the default DL BWP is the
initial DL BWP.

If a UE is provided by *bwp-InactivityTimer* a timer value for the
serving cell \[11, TS 38.321\] and the timer is running, the UE
decrements the timer at the end of a subframe for FR1 or at the end of a
half subframe for FR2 if the restarting conditions in \[11, TS 38.321\]
are not met during the interval of the subframe for FR1 or of the half
subframe for FR2.

For a cell where a UE changes an active DL BWP due to a BWP inactivity
timer expiration and for accommodating a delay in the active DL BWP
change or the active UL BWP change required by the UE \[10, TS 38.133\],
the UE is not required to receive or transmit in the cell during a time
duration from the beginning of a subframe for FR1, or of half of a
subframe for FR2, that is immediately after the BWP inactivity timer
expires until the beginning of a slot where the UE can receive or
transmit.

When a UE\'s BWP inactivity timer for a cell within FR1 (or FR2) expires
within a time duration where the UE is not required to receive or
transmit for an active UL/DL BWP change in the cell or in a different
cell within FR1 (or FR2), the UE delays the active UL/DL BWP change
triggered by the BWP inactivity timer expiration until a subframe for
FR1 or half a subframe for FR2 that is immediately after the UE
completes the active UL/DL BWP change in the cell or in the different
cell within FR1 (or FR2).

If a UE is provided by *firstActiveDownlinkBWP-Id* a first active DL BWP
and by *firstActiveUplinkBWP-Id* a first active UL BWP on a carrier of a
secondary cell, the UE uses the indicated DL BWP and the indicated UL
BWP as the respective first active DL BWP on the secondary cell and
first active UL BWP on the carrier of the secondary cell.

A UE does not expect to monitor PDCCH when the UE performs RRM
measurements \[10, TS 38.133\] over a bandwidth that is not within the
active DL BWP for the UE.

13 UE procedure for monitoring Type0-PDCCH CSS sets
===================================================

If during cell search a UE determines from *MIB* that a CORESET for
Type0-PDCCH CSS set is present, as described in clause 4.1, the UE
determines a number of consecutive resource blocks and a number of
consecutive symbols for the CORESET of the Type0-PDCCH CSS set from
*controlResourceSetZero in* *pdcch-ConfigSIB1*, as described in Tables
13-1 through 13-10, for operation without shared spectrum channel
access, or as described in Tables 13-1A and 13-4A for operation with
shared spectrum channel access, and determines PDCCH monitoring
occasions from *searchSpaceZero in pdcch-ConfigSIB1*, included in *MIB*,
as described in Tables 13-11 through 13-15. ![](media/image870.wmf) and
![](media/image871.wmf) are the SFN and slot index within a frame of the
CORESET based on SCS of the CORESET and ![](media/image872.wmf) and
![](media/image873.wmf) are the SFN and slot index based on SCS of the
CORESET, respectively, where the SS/PBCH block with index
![](media/image874.wmf) overlaps in time with system frame
![](media/image872.wmf) and slot ![](media/image875.wmf). The symbols of
the CORESET associated with *pdcch-ConfigSIB1* in *MIB* or with
*searchSpaceSIB1 in PDCCH-ConfigCommon have normal cyclic prefix.*

For operation without shared spectrum channel access, a UE assumes that
the offset in Tables 13-1 through 13-10 is defined with respect to the
SCS of the CORESET for Type0-PDCCH CSS set, provided by
*subCarrierSpacingCommon,* from the smallest RB index of the CORESET for
Type0-PDCCH CSS set to the smallest RB index of the common RB
overlapping with the first RB of the corresponding SS/PBCH block. In
Tables 13-7, 13-8, and 13-10 ![](media/image876.wmf) is defined in \[4,
TS 38.211\].

For operation with shared spectrum channel access, a UE determines an
offset from a smallest RB index of the CORESET for Type0-PDCCH CSS set
to a smallest RB index of the common RB overlapping with a first RB of
the corresponding SS/PBCH block

\- *according to the offset in* Table 13-1A or Table 13-4A, *if the*
frequency position *of the* SS/PBCH block corresponds to the GSCN of a
synchronization raster entry as defined in \[8-1, TS 38.101-1\], and

\- according to *a sum of a first offset and a second offset* if the
frequency position of the SS/PBCH block is provided by *ssbFrequency* in
a measurement configuration associated with a reporting configuration
providing *reportCGI* and does not correspond to the GSCN of a
synchronization raster entry as defined in \[8-1, TS 38.101-1\]*, where*

\- the first offset is *provided in* Table 13-1A or Table 13-4A, and

\- the second offset is determined as the offset from a smallest RB
index of the common RB overlapping with the first RB of the SS/PBCH
block indicated in the measurement configuration to a smallest RB index
of the common RB overlapping with the first RB of a SS/PBCH block
hypothetically located at the GSCN of a synchronization raster entry,
where the single synchronization raster entry is located in the same
channel as the SS/PBCH block used for the shared spectrum channel access
procedure, as described in \[15, TS 37.213\]

where the offsets are defined with respect to the SCS of the CORESET for
Type0-PDCCH CSS set that is *same as the SCS of the corresponding
SS/PBCH block.*

For operation without shared spectrum channel access and for the SS/PBCH
block and CORESET multiplexing pattern 1, a UE monitors PDCCH in the
Type0-PDCCH CSS set over two consecutive slots starting from slot
![](media/image877.wmf). For SS/PBCH block with index
![](media/image874.wmf), the UE determines an index of slot
![](media/image877.wmf) as ![](media/image878.wmf) that is in a frame
with system frame number (SFN) ![](media/image879.wmf) satisfying
![](media/image880.wmf) if ![](media/image881.wmf), or in a frame with
SFN satisfying ![](media/image882.wmf) if ![](media/image883.wmf).
![](media/image884.wmf) and ![](media/image885.wmf) are provided by
Tables 13-11 and 13-12, and ![](media/image886.wmf) based on the SCS for
PDCCH receptions in the CORESET \[4, TS 38.211\]. The index for the
first symbol of the CORESET in slots ![](media/image877.wmf) and
![](media/image887.wmf) is the first symbol index provided by Tables
13-11 and 13-12.

For operation with shared spectrum channel access and for the SS/PBCH
block and CORESET multiplexing pattern 1, a UE monitors PDCCH in the
Type0-PDCCH CSS set over slots that include Type0-PDCCH monitoring
occasions associated with SS/PBCH blocks that are quasi co-located with
the SS/PBCH block that provides a CORESET for Type0-PDCCH CSS set with
respect to average gain, quasi co-location \'typeA\' and \'typeD\'
properties, when applicable \[6, TS 38.214\]. For a candidate SS/PBCH
block index $\overline{i}$, where
$0 \leq \overline{i} \leq {\overline{L}}_{\max} - 1$, two consecutive
slots starting from slot $n_{0}$ include the associated Type0-PDCCH
monitoring occasions. The UE determines an index of slot $n_{0}$ as
$n_{0} = \left( O \cdot 2^{\mu} + \left\lfloor \overline{i} \cdot M \right\rfloor \right)\text{\ mod\ }N_{\text{slot}}^{frame,\ \mu}$
that is in a frame with system frame number (SFN) $\text{SFN}_{C}$
satisfying $\text{SFN}_{C}\ mod\ 2 = 0$ if
$\left\lfloor \left( O \cdot 2^{\mu} + \left\lfloor \overline{i} \cdot M \right\rfloor \right)/N_{\text{slot}}^{frame,\ \mu} \right\rfloor\ mod\ 2 = 0$,
or in a frame with SFN satisfying $\text{SFN}_{C}\ mod\ 2 = 1$ if
$\left\lfloor \left( O \cdot 2^{\mu} + \left\lfloor \overline{i} \cdot M \right\rfloor \right)/N_{\text{slot}}^{frame,\ \mu} \right\rfloor\ mod\ 2 = 1$.
$M$ and $O$ are provided by Table 13-11, and $\mu \in \{ 0,\ 1\}$ based
on the SCS for PDCCH receptions in the CORESET \[4, TS 38.211\]. The
index for the first symbol of the CORESET in slots $n_{0}$ and
$n_{0} + 1$ is the first symbol index provided by Table 13-11. The UE
does not expect to be configured with $M = 1/2$, or with $M = 2$, when
$N_{\text{SSB}}^{\text{QCL}} = 1$.

For the SS/PBCH block and CORESET multiplexing patterns 2 and 3, a UE
monitors PDCCH in the Type0-PDCCH CSS set over one slot with Type0-PDCCH
CSS set periodicity equal to the periodicity of SS/PBCH block. For the
SS/PBCH block and CORESET multiplexing patterns 2 and 3, if the active
DL BWP is the initial DL BWP, the UE is expected to be able to perform
radio link monitoring, as described in clause 5, and measurements for
radio resource management \[10, TS 38.133\] using a SS/PBCH block that
provides a CORESET for Type0-PDCCH CSS set. For a SS/PBCH block with
index ![](media/image874.wmf), the UE determines the slot index
![](media/image888.wmf) and ![](media/image889.wmf) based on parameters
provided by Tables 13-13 through 13-15.

If a UE detects a first SS/PBCH block and determines that a CORESET for
Type0-PDCCH CSS set is not present, and for ![](media/image920.wmf) for
FR1 or for ![](media/image921.wmf) for FR2, the UE may determine the
nearest (in the corresponding frequency direction) global
synchronization channel number (GSCN) of a second SS/PBCH block having a
CORESET for an associated Type0-PDCCH CSS set as
![](media/image922.wmf). ![](media/image923.wmf) is the GSCN of the
first SS/PBCH block and ![](media/image924.wmf) is a GSCN offset
provided by Table 13-16 for FR1 and Table 13-17 for FR2. If the UE
detects the second SS/PBCH block and the second SS/PBCH block does not
provide a CORESET for Type0-PDCCH CSS set, as described in clause 4.1,
the UE may ignore the information related to GSCN of SS/PBCH block
locations for performing cell search.

If a UE detects a SS/PBCH block and determines that a CORESET for
Type0-PDCCH CSS set is not present, and for ![](media/image925.wmf) for
FR1 or for ![](media/image926.wmf) for FR2, the UE determines that there
is no SS/PBCH block having an associated Type0-PDCCH CSS set within a
GSCN range ![](media/image927.wmf). ![](media/image928.wmf)and
![](media/image929.wmf) are respectively determined by
*controlResourceSetZero* and *searchSpaceZero in pdcch-ConfigSIB1.* If
the GSCN range is ![](media/image930.wmf), the UE determines that there
is no information for a second SS/PBCH block with a CORESET for an
associated Type0-PDCCH CSS set on the detected SS/PBCH block*.*

If a UE does not detect any SS/PBCH block providing a CORESET for
Type0-PDCCH CSS set, as described in clause 4.1, within a time period
determined by the UE, the UE may ignore the information related to GSCN
of SS/PBCH locations in performing cell search.

14 Integrated access-backhaul operation 
=======================================

Throughout this specification, unless otherwise noted, statements using
the term \"UE\" in clauses 4 through 13 are equally applicable to the
IAB-MT of an IAB node.

A procedure for an IAB-MT to perform cell search, system information
acquisition, or random access procedure is same as a corresponding one
for a UE except for the following.

For initial cell selection, an IAB-MT may assume that half frames with
SS/PBCH blocks occur with a periodicity of 16 frames.

For PRACH transmission, an IAB-MT determines frames and subframes/slots
within the frames containing PRACH occasions as described in \[4, TS
38.211\].

The IAB-MT determines an association period for mapping SS/PBCH blocks
to PRACH occasions based on a PRACH configuration period as described in
clause 8.1 and according to Table 14-1 instead of Table 8.1-1. An
association pattern period includes one or more association periods and
is determined so that a pattern between PRACH occasions and SS/PBCH
blocks repeats at most every 640 msec. A PRACH occasion in a PRACH slot
is valid according to the conditions in clause 8.1.

Table 14-1: Mapping between PRACH configuration period and SS/PBCH block
to PRACH occasion association period for an IAB-MT

  PRACH configuration period (msec)   Association period (number of PRACH configuration periods)
  ----------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------
  10                                  {1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64}
  20                                  {1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32}
  40                                  {1, 2, 4, 8, 16}
  80                                  {1, 2, 4, 8}
  160                                 {1, 2, 4}
  320                                 {1, 2}
  640                                 {1}

If an IAB-node is provided an index $T_{\text{delta}}$ in a Timing Delta
MAC CE \[11, TS 38.321\] from a serving cell, the IAB-node may assume
that
$\left( N_{\text{TA}}/2 + N_{\text{delta}} + T_{\text{delta}} \cdot G_{\text{step}} \right) \cdot T_{\text{c}}$
*is a time difference between a DU transmission of a signal from the
serving cell and a reception of the signal by the IAB-MT* when
$N_{\text{TA}}/2 + N_{\text{delta}} + T_{\text{delta}} \cdot G_{\text{step}} > 0$,
where $N_{\text{TA}}$ is obtained as for a \"UE\" in clause 4.2 ***for
the TAG containing the serving cell and*** $N_{\text{delta}}$ and
$G_{\text{step}}$ are determined as

\- $N_{\text{delta}} = - 70528$ and $G_{\text{step}} = 64$, if the
serving cell providing the Timing Delta MAC CE operates in FR1,

\- $N_{\text{delta}} = - 17664$ and $G_{\text{step}} = 32$, if the
serving cell providing the Timing Delta MAC CE operates in FR2

The IAB-node may use the time difference to determine a DU transmission
time.

A slot format for an IAB-DU or an IAB-MT includes downlink symbols,
uplink symbols, and flexible symbols.

For each cell of an IAB-DU, the IAB-DU can be provided an indication for
a slot format over a number of slots by *gNB-DU Cell Resource
Configuration* \[16, TS 38.473\].

For each serving cell, an IAB-MT can be provided an indication for a
slot format over a number of slots by
*tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated-IAB-MT*. If the IAB-MT is provided
*tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated-IAB-MT*, the statements in clause 11.1
that include \"*tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated*\" apply to the IAB-MT
of an IAB node by replacing \"*tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated*\" with
\"*tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated-IAB-MT*\" for the IAB-MT, except
that the *tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated-IAB-MT* provides

\- a set of slot configurations by
*slotSpecificConfigurationsToAddModList-IAB-MT*

\- for each slot configuration from the set of slot configurations

\- a slot index for a slot provided by *slotIndex*

\- a set of symbols for a slot by *symbols-IAB-MT* where

\- if *symbols-IAB-MT* = *allDownlink*, all symbols in the slot are
downlink

\- if *symbols-IAB-MT* = *allUplink*, all symbols in the slot are uplink

\- if *symbols-IAB-MT* = *explicit*, *nrofDownlinkSymbols* provides a
number of downlink first symbols in the slot and *nrofUplinkSymbols*
provides a number of uplink last symbols in the slot. If
*nrofDownlinkSymbols* is not provided, there are no downlink first
symbols in the slot and if *nrofUplinkSymbols* is not provided, there
are no uplink last symbols in the slot. The remaining symbols in the
slot are flexible.

\- if *symbols-IAB-MT* = *explicit-IAB-MT*, *nrofUplinkSymbols* provides
a number of uplink first symbols in the slot and *nrofDownlinkSymbols*
provides a number of downlink last symbols in the slot. If
*nrofUplinkSymbols* is not provided, there are no uplink first symbols
in the slot and if *nrofDownlinkSymbols* is not provided, there are no
downlink last symbols in the slot. The remaining symbols in the slot are
flexible.

An IAB-MT can be provided, by *SlotFormatCombinationsPerCell*, a list of
slot format combinations applicable for one serving cell and, by
*SlotFormatIndicator*, a configuration for monitor a DCI format 2\_0
indicating a slot format combination, from the list of slot format
combinations, over a number of slots as described in clause 11.1.1. In
addition to the slot formats in Table 11.1.1-1, an SFI field for an
IAB-MT in DCI format 2\_0 can indicate to the IAB-MT a slot format from
the slot formats in Table 14-2.

For a serving cell of an IAB-MT, the IAB-MT can be provided by Provided
Guard Symbols MAC CE a number of symbols that will not be used for the
IAB-MT in slots where the IAB-node transitions between IAB-MT and
IAB-node DU and a SCS configuration for the number of symbols \[11, TS
38.321\].

With reference to slots of an IAB-DU cell, a symbol in a slot of an
IAB-DU cell can be configured to be of hard, soft, or unavailable type.
When a downlink, uplink, or flexible symbol is configured as hard, the
IAB-DU cell can respectively transmit, receive, or either transmit or
receive in the symbol.

When a downlink, uplink, or flexible symbol is configured as soft, the
IAB-DU cell can respectively transmit, receive or either transmit or
receive in the symbol only if

\- the IAB-MT does not transmit or receive during the symbol of the
IAB-DU cell, or

\- the IAB-MT would transmit or receive during the symbol of the IAB-DU
cell, and the transmission or reception during the symbol of the IAB-DU
cell is not changed due to a use of the symbol by the IAB-DU, or

\- the IAB-MT detects a DCI format 2\_5 with an AI index field value
indicating the soft symbol as available

When a symbol is configured as unavailable, the IAB-DU neither transmits
nor receives in the symbol.

A symbol of a slot is equivalent to being configured as hard if an
IAB-DU would transmit a SS/PBCH block, PDCCH for Type0-PDCCH CSS sets
configured by *pdcchConfigSIB1,* or a periodic CSI-RS in the symbol of
the slot, or would receive a PRACH or a SR in the symbol of the slot.

If an IAB-node is provided an *AvailabilityIndicator*, the IAB-node is
provided an AI-RNTI by *ai-RNTI* and a payload size of a DCI format 2\_5
by *dci-PayloadSizeAI*. The IAB-node is also provided a search space set
configuration, by ***SearchSpace, for monitoring PDCCH.***

For each cell of an IAB-DU in a set of cells of the IAB-DU, the IAB-DU
can be provided:

\- an identity of the IAB-DU cell by *iab-DU-CellIdentity*

\- a location of an availability indicator (AI) index field in DCI
format 2\_5 by *positionInDCI-AI*

\- a set of availability combinations by *availabilityCombinations*,
where each availability combination in the set of availability
combinations includes

\- *resourceAvailability* indicating availability of soft symbols in one
or more slots for the IAB-DU cell, and

\- a mapping for the soft symbol availability combinations provided by
*resourceAvailability* to a corresponding AI index field value in DCI
format 2\_5 provided by *availabilityCombinationId*

The IAB-DU can assume a same SCS configuration for
*availabilityCombinations* for a cell as an SCS configuration provided
by *gNB-DU Cell Resource Configuration* for the cell.

An AI index field value in a DCI format 2\_5 indicates to an IAB-DU a
soft symbol availability in each slot for a number of slots starting
from the earliest slot of the IAB-DU which overlaps in time with the
slot of the IAB-MT where the IAB-MT detects the DCI format 2\_5. The
number of slots is equal to or larger than a PDCCH monitoring
periodicity for DCI format 2\_5 as provided by ***SearchSpace***. The AI
index field includes ![](media/image933.wmf) bits where maxAIindex is
the maximum of the values provided by corresponding
*availabilityCombinationId*. An availability for a soft symbol in a slot
is identified by a corresponding value *resourceAvailability* as
provided in Table 14-3.

and types of soft symbol availability in a slot

If a PDCCH monitoring periodicity for DCI format 2\_5 is smaller than a
duration of an availability combination of soft symbols over a number of
slots that the IAB-MT obtains at a PDCCH monitoring occasion for DCI
format 2\_5 by a corresponding AI index field value, and the IAB-MT
detects more than one DCI formats 2\_5 indicating an availability
combination of soft symbols in a slot, the IAB-MT expects that each of
the more than one DCI formats 2\_5 indicates a same value for the
availability combination of the soft symbols in the slot. An IAB-MT
monitors PDCCH candidates for a DCI format 2\_5 with CRC scrambled by
AI-RNTI in one or both of the following search space sets:

\- a Type3-PDCCH CSS set configured by *SearchSpace* in *PDCCH-Config*
with *searchSpaceType* = *common*;

\- a USS set configured by *SearchSpace* in *PDCCH-Config* with
*searchSpaceType* = ue-Specific.

15 Dual active protocol stack based handover
============================================

If a UE indicates a capability for dual active protocol stack based
handover (DAPS HO), the UE can be provided with a source MCG and a
target MCG.

If a UE is configured with a target MCG using NR radio access in FR1 or
in FR2 and with a source MCG using NR radio access in FR2 or in FR1,
respectively, the UE performs transmission power control independently
per cell group as described in clauses 7.1 through 7.5.

If a UE is configured with a target MCG using NR radio access in FR1 and
a source MCG using NR radio access in FR1, the UE is configured a
maximum power $P_{\text{MCG}}$ for transmissions on the target MCG by
*p-DAPS-Target* and a maximum power $P_{\text{SCG}}$ for transmissions
on the source MCG by *p-DAPS-Source* and with an inter-CG power sharing
mode by *uplinkPowerSharingDAPS-Mode*. The UE determines a transmission
power on the target MCG and a transmission power on the source MCG per
frequency range.

If the UE indicates support for semi-static power sharing mode1 and is
provided *uplinkPowerSharingDAPS-Mode* = *Semi-static-mode1*, the UE
determines a transmission power for the target MCG or for the source MCG
as described in clause 7.6.2 for ***nrdc-PCmode-FR1*** =
*Semi-static-mode1* by considering the target MCG as the MCG and the
source MCG as the SCG.

If the UE indicates support for semi-static power sharing mode2 and is
provided *uplinkPowerSharingDAPS-Mode* = *Semi-static-mode2*, the UE
determines a transmission power for the target MCG or for the source SCG
as described in clause 7.6.2 for ***nrdc-PCmode-FR1*** =
*Semi-static-mode2* by considering the target MCG as the MCG and the
source MCG as the SCG. The UE expects to be provided
*uplinkPowerSharingDAPS-Mode* = *Semi-static-mode2* only for synchronous
DAPS HO operation \[10, TS 38.133\].

If the UE indicates support for dynamic power sharing and is provided
*uplinkPowerSharingDAPS-Mode* = *Dynamic*, the UE determines a
transmission power for the target MCG or for the source MCG as described
in clause 7.6.2 for ***nrdc-PCmode-FR1*** = *Dynamic* by considering the
target MCG as the MCG and the source MCG as the SCG.

Intra-frequency DAPS handover is described in clause 6.1.3.2 of \[10, TS
38.133\].

For DAPS handover that is not intra-frequency, if

> \- the UE does not indicate support of
> *interFreqUL-TransCancellationDAPS-r16*, and
>
> \- UE does not indicate a capability for power sharing between source
> and target MCG in DAPS handover or the UE is not provided with
> *uplinkPowerSharingDAPS-Mode*,

the UE does not expect transmissions on the target and source cell in
overlapping time resources.

For DAPS handover that is not intra-frequency, if

> \- the UE indicates support of
> *interFreqUL-TransCancellationDAPS-r16*, and
>
> \- UE does not indicate a capability for power sharing between source
> and target MCG in DAPS handover or the UE is not provided with
> *uplinkPowerSharingDAPS-Mode*, and
>
> \- UE transmissions on the target cell and the source cell are in
> overlapping time resources,

the UE transmits only on the target cell, and cancels the transmission
to source cell.

For intra-frequency DAPS handover, if

> \- UE transmissions on the target cell and the source cell are in
> overlapping time resources,

the UE transmits only on the target cell and cancels the transmission on
the source cell.

The UE does not expect to cancel a transmission on the source cell if a
first symbol of the transmission on the source cell is less than
$T_{\text{proc,2}} + d$ after a last symbol of a CORESET where the UE
receives a PDCCH providing a DCI format scheduling a transmission on the
target cell. $T_{\text{proc,2}}$ is the PUSCH preparation time for the
corresponding PUSCH processing capability \[6, TS 38.214\] assuming
$d_{\text{2}\text{,1}} = 1$, $d$ is a time duration corresponding to 2
symbols for SCS configuration $\mu$, and $\mu$ is the smallest SCS
configuration between the SCS configuration of the PDCCH providing the
DCI format and the SCS configuration for the transmission on the source
cell. If the UE transmits PRACH using 1.25 kHz or 5 kHz SCS on the
source cell, the UE determines $T_{\text{proc,2}}$ assuming SCS
configuration $\mu = 0$.

A UE does not expect to cancel a transmission on the source cell if the
first symbol of the source cell transmission occurs, relative to a last
symbol of a PDSCH reception conveying a RAR message with a RAR UL grant
on the target cell, after a number of symbols that is smaller than
$N_{\text{T,1}} + N_{\text{T,2}} + 0.5$ msec, where $N_{\text{T,1}}$ is
a time duration of $N_{\text{1}}$ symbols corresponding to a PDSCH
processing time for UE processing capability 1 when additional PDSCH
DM-RS is configured, $N_{\text{T,2}}$ is a time duration of
$N_{\text{2}}$ symbols corresponding to a PUSCH preparation time for UE
processing capability 1 \[6, TS 38.214\] and the UE considers that
$N_{\text{1}}$ and $N_{2}$ correspond to the smaller of the SCS
configurations for the PDSCH on the target cell and the transmission on
the source cell. For $\mu = 0$, the UE assumes $N_{\text{1,0}} = 14$
\[6, TS 38.214\].

For intra-frequency DAPS handover operation, the UE expects that an
active DL BWP and an active UL BWP on the target cell are within an
active DL BWP and an active UL BWP on the source cell, respectively.

If a UE is provided search space sets on both the target MCG and the
source MCG, in any slot the UE does not expect to have USS sets on both
the target MCG and the source MCG that result in the number of monitored
PDCCH candidates and the total number of non-overlapped CCEs in both
cells that each exceed the corresponding maximum numbers per slot
defined in Table 10.1-2 and Table 10.1-3.

For DAPS operation in a same frequency band, a UE does not transmit
PUSCH/PUCCH/SRS to the source MCG in a slot overlapping in time with a
PRACH transmission to the target MCG or when a gap between a first or
last symbol of a PRACH transmission to the target MCG in a first slot
would be separated by less than $N$ symbols from a last or first symbol,
respectively, of the PUSCH/PUCCH/SRS transmission to the source MCG in a
second slot. For DAPS operation in a same frequency band, a UE does not
transmit PRACH on the source MCG in a slot overlapping in time with a
PUSCH/PUCCH/SRS transmission on the target MCG or when a gap between the
first or last symbol of a PUSCH/PUCCH/SRS transmission on the target MCG
is separated by less than $N$ symbols from a last or a first symbol,
respectively, of a PRACH transmission on the source MCG. $N = 2$ for
$\mu = 0$ or $\mu = 1$, $N = 4$ for $\mu = 2$ or $\mu = 3$, and $\mu$ is
the SCS configuration of the active UL BWP for the PUSCH/PUCCH/SRS
transmission. The PUSCH processing capability is the processing
capability of source cell.

16 UE **procedures for sidelink**
=================================

A UE is provided by *SL-BWP-Config* or *SL-BWP-ConfigCommon* a BWP for
SL transmissions (SL BWP) with numerology and resource grid determined
as described in \[4, TS 38.211\]. For a resource pool within the SL BWP,
the UE is provided by *sl-NumSubchannel* a number of sub-channels where
each sub-channel includes a number of contiguous RBs provided by
*sl-SubchannelSize*. The first RB of the first sub-channel in the SL BWP
is indicated by *sl-StartRB-Subchannel*. Available slots for a resource
pool are provided by *sl-TimeResource* and occur with a periodicity of
10240 ms. For an available slot without S-SS/PSBCH blocks, SL
transmissions can start from a first symbol indicated by
*sl-StartSymbol* and be within a number of consecutive symbols indicated
by *sl-LengthSymbols*. For an available slot with S-SS/PSBCH blocks, the
first symbol and the number of consecutive symbols is predetermined.

The UE expects to use a same numerology in the SL BWP and in an active
UL BWP in a same carrier of a same cell. If the active UL BWP numerology
is different than the SL BWP numerology, the SL BWP is deactivated.

A priority of a PSSCH according to **NR radio access** or according to
E-UTRA **radio access** is indicated by a priority field in a respective
scheduling SCI format. A priority of a PSSS/SSSS/PSBCH according to
E-UTRA radio access is provided by *sl-SSB-PriorityEUTRA* \[13, TS
36.213\]. A priority of an S-SS/PSBCH block is provided by
*sl-SSB-PriorityNR*. A priority of a PSFCH is same as the priority of a
corresponding PSSCH.

**A UE does not expect to be provided search space sets associated with
CORESETs on more than one cell to monitor PDCCH for detection of DCI
format 3\_0 or DCI format 3\_1.**

16.1 Synchronization procedures
-------------------------------

A UE receives the following SL synchronization signals in order to
perform synchronization procedures based on S-SS/PSBCH blocks: SL
primary synchronization signals (S-PSS) and SL secondary synchronization
signals (S-SSS) \[4, TS 38.211\].

A UE assumes that reception occasions of a physical sidelink broadcast
channel (PSBCH), S-PSS, and S-SSS are in consecutive symbols \[4, TS
38.211\] and form a S-SS/PSBCH block.

For reception of a S-SS/PSBCH block, a UE assumes a frequency location
corresponding to the subcarrier with index 66 in the S-SS/PSBCH block
\[4, TS 38.211\], is provided by *sl-AbsoluteFrequencySSB*. The UE
assumes that a S-PSS symbol, a S-SSS symbol, and a PSBCH symbol have a
same transmission power. The UE assumes a same numerology of the
S-SS/PSBCH as for a SL BWP of the S-SS/PSBCH block reception, and that a
bandwidth of the S-SS/PSBCH is within a bandwidth of the SL BWP. The UE
assumes the subcarrier with index 0 in the S-SS/PSBCH block is aligned
with a subcarrier with index 0 in an RB of the SL BWP.

A UE is provided, by *sl-NumSSB-WithinPeriod*, a number
$N_{\text{period}}^{S - SSB}$ of S-SS/PSBCH blocks in a period of 16
frames. The UE assumes that a transmission of the S-SS/PSBCH blocks in
the period is with a periodicity of 16 frames. The UE determines indexes
of slots that include S-SS/PSBCH block as
$N_{\text{offset}}^{S - SSB}$+$\left( N_{\text{interval}}^{S - SSB} + 1 \right) \cdot i_{S - SSB}$,
where

\- index 0 corresponds to a first slot in a frame with SFN of the
serving cell satisfying $(SFN\ mod\ 16) = 0$ or DFN satisfying (DFN mod
16) = 0

\- $i_{S - SSB}$ is a S-SS/PSBCH block index within the number of
S-SS/PSBCH blocks in the period, with
$0 \leq i_{S - SSB} \leq N_{\text{period}}^{S - SSB} - 1$

\- $N_{\text{offset}}^{S - SSB}$ is a slot offset from a start of the
period to the first slot including S-SS/PSBCH block, provided by
*sl-TimeOffsetSSB*

\- $N_{\text{interval}}^{S - SSB}$ is a slot interval between S-SS/PSBCH
blocks, provided by *sl-TimeInterval*

For paired spectrum, an S-SS/PSBCH block can be transmitted/received
only in a slot of an UL carrier. For unpaired spectrum, an S-SS/PSBCH
block can be transmitted/received only in a slot of which all OFDM
symbols are configured as UL by *tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon* of the
serving cell if provided or *sl-TDD-Configuration* if provided or
*sl-TDD-Config* of the received PSBCH if provided. Or if
*tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon* and *sl-TDD-Configuration* are not
provided for a spectrum indicated with only PC5 interface in Table
5.2E.1-1 in \[TS 38.101-1\], an S-SS/PSBCH block can be
transmitted/received in any slot of the spectrum.

For transmission of an S-SS/PSBCH block, a UE includes a bit sequence
$a_{0},\ a_{1},\ a_{2},\ a_{3},\ \ldots,\ a_{11}$ in the PSBCH payload
to indicate *sl-TDD-Config* and provide a slot format over a number of
slots.

For paired spectrum, or if *tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon* and
*sl-TDD-Configuration* are not provided for a spectrum indicated with
only PC5 interface in Table 5.2E.1-1 in \[TS 38.101-1\],

\-
$a_{0},\ a_{1},\ a_{2},\ a_{3},a_{4}{,\ a}_{5},\ a_{6},\ a_{7},a_{8},\ a_{9},\ a_{10},\ a_{11}$
are set to \'1\';

else

\- $a_{0} = 0$ if *pattern1* is provided by *sl-TDD-Configuration or
tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon*; $a_{0} = 1$ if both *pattern1* and
*pattern2* are provided by *sl-TDD-Configuration or
tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon* as described in clause 11.1

\- $a_{1},\ a_{2},\ a_{3},a_{4}$ are determined based on

\- $P$ *in pattern1* as described in Table 16.1-1 for $a_{0} = 0$

\- $P$ *in pattern1* and $P_{2}$ *in pattern2* as described in Table
16.1-2 for $a_{0} = 1$

where $P$ and $P_{2}$ are as described in clause 11.1

\- $a_{5},\ a_{6},\ a_{7},a_{8},\ a_{9},\ a_{10},\ a_{11}$ are the 7th
to 1st LSBs of $u_{\text{slots}}^{\text{SL}}$*, respectively*

\- for $a_{0} = 0$,
$u_{\text{slots}}^{\text{SL}} = u_{\text{slots}}*2^{\mu - \mu_{\text{ref}}} + \left\lfloor \frac{u_{\text{sym}}*2^{\mu - \mu_{\text{ref}}}}{L} \right\rfloor + I_{1}$

\- for $a_{0} = 1$,
$u_{\text{slots}}^{\text{SL}} = \left\lfloor \frac{u_{slots,2}*2^{\mu - \mu_{\text{ref}}} + \left\lfloor \frac{u_{sym,2}*2^{\mu - \mu_{\text{ref}}}}{L} \right\rfloor + I_{2}}{w} \right\rfloor*\left\lceil \frac{{P*2}^{\mu} + 1}{w} \right\rceil + \left\lfloor \frac{u_{\text{slots}}*2^{\mu - \mu_{\text{ref}}} + \left\lfloor \frac{u_{\text{sym}}*2^{\mu - \mu_{\text{ref}}}}{L} \right\rfloor + I_{1}}{w} \right\rfloor$

> where

\- $L$ is the number of symbols in a slot: $L = 12$ if *cyclicPrefix* =
\"ECP\"; else, $L = 14$

\- $I_{1}$ is 1 if
$u_{\text{sym}}*2^{\mu - \mu_{\text{ref}}}\ mod\ L \geq \ L - Y$, else
$I_{1}$ is 0

\- $I_{2}$ is 1 if
$u_{sym,2}*2^{\mu - \mu_{\text{ref}}}\ mod\ L \geq L - Y$, else $I_{2}$
is 0

\- $Y$ is the sidelink starting symbol index provided by
*sl-StartSymbol*

\- $w$ is the granularity of slots indication as described in Table
16.1-2

\- $\mu_{\text{ref}}$*,* $u_{\text{slots}}$, $u_{\text{sym}}$,
$u_{slots,2}$, $u_{sym,2}$ are the parameters of
*tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon* as described in clause 11.1, or the
parameters of *sl-TDD-Configuration* as defined in \[12, TS 38.331\]

\- $\mu = 0,\ 1,\ 2,\ 3$ corresponds to SL SCS as defined in \[4, TS
38.211\]

If a UE would transmit or receive an S-SS/PSBCH block, and the
transmission or reception would overlap in time with transmissions or
receptions on the sidelink using E-UTRA radio access, the UE transmits
or receives the signal/channel with the higher priority.

If a UE would transmit or receive sidelink synchronization signals for
E-UTRA radio access, and the transmission or reception would overlap in
time with sidelink transmissions or receptions using NR radio access,
the UE transmits or receives the signal/channel with the higher
priority.

16.2 Power control
------------------

### 16.2.0 S-SS/PSBCH blocks

A UE determines a power $P_{\text{S-SSB}}(i)$ for an S-SS/PSBCH block
transmission occasion in slot $i$ on active SL BWP $b$ of carrier $f$ as

$P_{\text{S-SSB}}(i) = \min\left( P_{\text{CMAX}},P_{\text{O},S - SSB} + 10\log_{10}\left( 2^{\mu} \bullet M_{\text{RB}}^{S - SSB} \right) + \alpha_{S - SSB} \cdot \text{PL} \right)$
\[dBm\]

where

\- $P_{\text{CMAX}}$ is defined in \[8-1, TS 38.101-1\]

\- $P_{\text{O},S - SSB}$ is a value of *dl-P0-PSBCH* if provided; else,
$P_{\text{S-SSB}}(i) = P_{\text{CMAX}}$

\- $\alpha_{S - SSB}$ is a value of *dl-Alpha-PSBCH, if* provided; else,
$\alpha_{S - SSB} = 1$

\- $PL = PL_{b,f,c}(q_{d})$ when the active SL BWP is on a serving cell
$c$, as described in clause 7.1.1 except that

\- the RS resource is the one the UE uses for determining a power of a
PUSCH transmission scheduled by a DCI format 0\_0 in serving cell $c$
when the UE is configured to monitor PDCCH for detection of DCI format
0\_0 in serving cell $c$

\- the RS resource is the one corresponding to the SS/PBCH block the UE
uses to obtain MIB when the UE is not configured to monitor PDCCH for
detection of DCI format 0\_0 in serving cell $c$

\- $M_{\text{RB}}^{S - SSB} = 11$ is a number of resource blocks for a
S-SS/PSBCH block transmission with SCS configuration $\mu$

### 16.2.1 PSSCH

A UE determines a power $P_{\text{PSSCH}}(i)$ for a PSSCH transmission
on a resource pool in symbols where a corresponding PSCCH is not
transmitted in PSCCH-PSSCH transmission occasion $i$ on active SL BWP
$b$ of carrier $f$ as:

$P_{\text{PSSCH}}(i) = \min\left( P_{\text{CMAX}},P_{\text{MAX},CBR},\min\left( P_{\text{PSSCH},D}\left( i \right),P_{\text{PSSCH},\text{SL}}(i) \right) \right)$
\[dBm\]

where

\- $P_{\text{CMAX}}$ is defined in \[8-1, TS 38.101-1\]

\- $P_{\text{MAX},CBR}$ is determined by a value of *sl-MaxTxPower based
on a priority level of the PSSCH transmission and a CBR range that

### 16.2.4 Prioritization of transmissions/receptions

#### 16.2.4.1 Simultaneous NR and E-UTRA transmission/reception

If a UE

\- **would transmit a first channel/signal using** E-UTRA radio access
**and second channels/signals using NR radio access, and**

\- **a transmission of the first channel/signal would overlap in time
with a transmission of the second channels/signals, and**

\- **the priorities of the channels/signals are known to both E-UTRA
radio access and NR radio access at the UE** $T$ **msec prior to the
start of the earliest of the two transmissions, where** $T \leq 4$ **and
is based on UE implementation,**

the UE transmits only the channels/signals of the radio access
technology with the highest priority as determined by the SCI formats
scheduling the transmissions or, in case of a S-SS/PSBCH block or a
sidelink synchronization signal using E-UTRA radio access, as indicated
by higher layers or, in case of PSFCH, equal to the priority of the
corresponding PSSCH.

If a UE

\- **would respectively transmit or receive a first channel/signal
using** E-UTRA radio access **and receive a second channel/signal or
transmit second channels/signals using NR radio access, and**

\- **a transmission or reception of the first channel/signal would
respectively overlap in time with a reception of the second
channel/signal or transmission of the second channels/signals, and**

\- **the priorities of the channels/signals are known to both E-UTRA
radio access and NR radio access at the UE** $T$ **msec prior to the
start of the earliest transmission or reception, where** $T \leq 4$
**and is based on UE implementation,**

the UE transmits or receives the channels/signals of the radio access
technology with the highest priority as determined by the SCI formats
scheduling the transmissions or, in case of a S-SS/PSBCH block or a
sidelink synchronization signal using E-UTRA radio access, as indicated
by higher layers or, in case of PSFCH, equal to the priority of the
corresponding PSSCH.

#### 16.2.4.2 Simultaneous PSFCH transmission/reception

If a UE

\- **would transmit** $N_{sch,Tx,PSFCH}$ **PSFCHs and receive**
$N_{sch,Rx,PSFCH}$**PSFCHs, and**

\- **transmissions of the** $N_{sch,Tx,PSFCH}$ **PSFCHs would overlap in
time with receptions of the** $N_{sch,Rx,PSFCH}$ **PSFCHs**

the UE transmits or receives only a set of PSFCHs corresponding to the
smallest priority field value, as determined by a first set of SCI
format 1-A and a second set of SCI format 1-A \[5, TS 38.212\] that are
respectively associated with the $N_{sch,Tx,PSFCH}$ PSFCHs and the
$N_{sch,Rx,PSFCH}$ PSFCHs.

If a UE **would transmit** $N_{sch,Tx,PSFCH}$ **PSFCHs in a PSFCH
transmission occasion,** the UE transmits $N_{Tx,PSFCH}$ PSFCHs
corresponding to the smallest $N_{Tx,PSFCH}$ priority field values
indicated in all SCI formats 1-A associated with the PSFCH transmission
occasion.

#### 16.2.4.3 Simultaneous SL and UL transmissions/receptions

If a UE

\- **would simultaneously transmit on the UL and on the SL in a carrier
or in two respective carriers, and**

\- **the UE is not capable of simultaneous transmissions on the UL and
on the SL in the carrier or in the two respective carriers**

the UE transmits only on the link, UL or SL, with the higher priority.

If a UE

\- would simultaneously transmit on the UL and receive on the SL in a
carrier, or

\- **would simultaneously transmit on the UL and receive on the SL in
two respective carriers and the UE is not capable of simultaneous
transmission on the UL and reception on the SL in the two respective
carriers**

the UE transmits on UL or receives on SL, with the higher priority.

**If a UE**

\- is capable of simultaneous transmissions on the UL and on the SL in
two respective carriers,

\- **would transmit on the UL and on the SL in the two respective
carriers,**

\- **the transmission on the UL would overlap with the transmission on
the SL over a time period, and**

\- **the total UE transmission power over the time period would exceed**
$P_{\text{CMAX}}$

the UE

\- reduces the power for the UL transmission prior to the start of the
UL transmission**, if the SL transmission has higher priority than the
UL transmission** as determined in clause 16.2.4.3.1**, so that the
total UE transmission power would not exceed** $P_{\text{CMAX}}$

\- reduces the power for the SL transmission prior to the start of the
SL transmission**, if the UL transmission has higher priority than the
SL transmission** as determined in clause 16.2.4.3.1**, so that the
total UE transmission power would not exceed** $P_{\text{CMAX}}$

##### 16.2.4.3.1 Prioritizations for sidelink and uplink transmissions/receptions 

A UE performs prioritization between SL transmissions/receptions and UL
transmissions after performing the procedures described in clause 9,
clause 9.2.5, and clause 9.2.6, and in clause 6.1 of \[6, TS 38.214\].

PSFCH transmissions in a slot have a same priority value as the smallest
priority value among PSSCH receptions with corresponding HARQ-ACK
information provided by the PSFCH transmissions in the slot.

PSFCH receptions in a slot have a same priority value as the smallest
priority value among PSSCH transmissions with corresponding HARQ-ACK
information provided by the PSFCH receptions in the slot.

A priority of S-SS/PSBCH block transmission or reception is provided by
*sl-SSB-PriorityNR.*

For prioritization between SL transmission or PSFCH/S-SS/PSBCH block
reception and UL transmission other than a PRACH, or a PUSCH scheduled
by an UL grant in a RAR and its retransmission, or a PUSCH corresponding
to Type-2 random access procedure and its retransmission, or a PUCCH
with sidelink HARQ-ACK information report

\- if the UL transmission is for a PUSCH or for a PUCCH with priority
index 1,

\- if *sl-PriorityThreshold-UL-URLLC* is provided

\- the SL transmission or reception has higher priority than the UL
transmission if the priority value of the SL transmission or reception
is smaller than *sl-PriorityThreshold-UL-URLLC;* otherwise, the UL
transmission has higher priority than the SL transmission or reception

\- else

\- the UL transmission has higher priority than the SL transmission or
reception

\- else

\- the SL transmission or reception has higher priority than the UL
transmission if the priority value of the SL transmission(s) or
reception is smaller than *sl-PriorityThreshold;* otherwise, the UL
transmission has higher priority than the SL transmission or reception

A PRACH transmission, or a PUSCH scheduled by an UL grant in a RAR and
its retransmission, or a PUSCH for Type-2 random access procedure and
its retransmission, or a PUCCH with HARQ-ACK information in response to
successRAR, or a PUCCH indicated by a DCI format 1\_0 with CRC scrambled
by a corresponding TC-RNTI has higher priority than a SL transmission or
reception.

A PUCCH transmission with a sidelink HARQ-ACK information report has
higher priority than a SL transmission if a priority value of the PUCCH
is smaller than a priority value of the SL transmission. The priority
value of the PUCCH transmission is as described in clause 16.5. If the
priority value of the PUCCH transmission is larger than the priority
value of the SL transmission, the SL transmission has higher priority.

A PUCCH transmission with a sidelink HARQ-ACK information report has
higher priority than a PSFCH/S-SS/PSBCH block reception if a priority
value of the PUCCH is smaller than a priority value of the SL reception.
If the priority value of the PUCCH transmission is larger than the
priority value of the PSFCH/S-SS/PSBCH block reception, the SL reception
has higher priority.

When one or more SL transmissions from a UE overlap in time with
multiple non-overlapping UL transmissions from the UE, the UE performs
the SL transmissions if at least one SL transmission is prioritized over
all UL transmissions subject to the UE processing timeline with respect
to the first SL transmission and the first UL transmission.

When one or more UL transmissions from a UE overlap in time with
multiple non-overlapping SL transmissions, the UE performs the UL
transmissions if at least one UL transmission is prioritized over all SL
transmissions subject to the UE processing timeline with respect to the
first SL transmission and the first UL transmission.

When one SL transmission overlaps in time with one or more overlapping
UL transmissions, the UE performs the SL transmission if the SL
transmission is prioritized over all UL transmissions subject to both
the UE multiplexing and processing timelines with respect to the first
SL transmission and the first UL transmission, where the UE processing
timeline with respect to the first SL transmission and the first UL
transmission is same as when one or more SL transmissions overlap in
time with multiple non-overlapping UL transmissions.

When one SL transmission overlaps in time with one or more overlapping
UL transmissions, the UE performs the UL transmission if at least one UL
transmission is prioritized over the SL transmission subject to both the
UE multiplexing and processing timelines with respect to the first SL
transmission and the first UL transmission, where the UE processing
timeline with respect to the first SL transmission and the first UL
transmission is same as when one or more SL transmissions overlap in
time with multiple non-overlapping UL transmissions.

16.3 UE procedure for reporting HARQ-ACK on sidelink 
----------------------------------------------------

A UE can be indicated by an SCI format scheduling a PSSCH reception to
transmit a PSFCH with HARQ-ACK information in response to the PSSCH
reception. The UE provides HARQ-ACK information that includes ACK or
NACK, or only NACK.

A UE can be provided, by *sl-PSFCH-Period*, a number of slots in a
resource pool for a period of PSFCH transmission occasion resources. If
the number is zero, PSFCH transmissions from the UE in the resource pool
are disabled.

A UE expects that a slot ${t'}_{k}^{\text{SL}}$
$(0 \leq k < {T'}_{\max}$) has a PSFCH transmission occasion resource if
$\text{k\ }\text{mod\ }N_{\text{PSSCH}}^{\text{PSFCH}} = 0$, where
${t'}_{k}^{\text{SL}}$ is defined in \[6, TS 38.214\], and ${T'}_{\max}$
is a number of slots that belong to the resource pool within 10240 msec
according to \[6, TS 38.214\], and $N_{\text{PSSCH}}^{\text{PSFCH}}$ is
provided by *sl-PSFCH-Period*.

A UE may be indicated by higher layers to not transmit a PSFCH in
response to a PSSCH reception \[11, TS 38.321\].

If a UE receives a PSSCH in a resource pool and the HARQ feedback
enabled/disabled indicator field in an associated SCI format 2-A or a
SCI format 2-B has value 1 \[5, TS 38.212\], the UE provides the
HARQ-ACK information in a PSFCH transmission in the resource pool. The
UE transmits the PSFCH in a first slot that includes PSFCH resources and
is at least a number of slots, provided by *sl-MinTimeGapPSFCH*, of the
resource pool after a last slot of the PSSCH reception.

A UE is provided by *sl-PSFCH-RB-Set* a set of
$M_{\text{PRB,\ }\text{set}}^{\text{PSFCH}}$ PRBs in a resource pool for
PSFCH transmission in a PRB of the resource pool. For a number of
$N_{\text{sub}\text{ch}}$ sub-channels for the resource pool, provided
by *sl-NumSubchannel*, and a number of PSSCH slots associated with a
PSFCH slot that is less than or equal to
$N_{\text{PSSCH}}^{\text{PSFCH}}$, the UE allocates the
$\left\lbrack \left( i + j \cdot N_{\text{PSSCH}}^{\text{PSFCH}} \right) \cdot M_{\text{subch,\ }\text{slot}}^{\text{PSFCH}},\ \left( i + 1 + j \cdot N_{\text{PSSCH}}^{\text{PSFCH}} \right) \cdot M_{\text{subch,\ }\text{slot}}^{\text{PSFCH}} - 1 \right\rbrack$
PRBs from the $M_{\text{PRB,\ }\text{set}}^{\text{PSFCH}}$ PRBs to slot
$i$ among the PSSCH slots associated with the PSFCH slot and sub-channel
$j$, where
$M_{\text{subch,\ }\text{slot}}^{\text{PSFCH}} = \frac{M_{\text{PRB,\ }\text{set}}^{\text{PSFCH}}}{\left( N_{\text{sub}\text{ch}} \cdot N_{\text{PSSCH}}^{\text{PSFCH}} \right)}$,
$0 \leq i < N_{\text{PSSCH}}^{\text{PSFCH}}$,
$0 \leq j < N_{\text{sub}\text{ch}}$, and the allocation starts in an
ascending order of $i$ and continues in an ascending order of $j$. The
UE expects that $M_{\text{PRB,\ }\text{set}}^{\text{PSFCH}}$ is a
multiple of
$N_{\text{sub}\text{ch}} \bullet N_{\text{PSSCH}}^{\text{PSFCH}}$*.*

The second OFDM symbol $l'$ of PSFCH transmission in a slot is defined
as $l^{'} = \text{sl}StartSymbol + sl\text{LengthSymbols} - 2$ .

A UE determines a number of PSFCH resources available for multiplexing
HARQ-ACK information in a PSFCH transmission as
$R_{\text{PRB,\ }\text{CS}}^{\text{PSFCH}} = {N_{\text{type\ }}^{\text{PSFCH}} \cdot M}_{\text{subch,\ }\text{slot}}^{\text{PSFCH}} \cdot N_{\text{CS}}^{\text{PSFCH}}$
where $N_{\text{CS}}^{\text{PSFCH}}$ is a number of cyclic shift pairs
for the resource pool provided by *sl-NumMuxCS-Pair* and, based on an
indication by *sl-PSFCH-CandidateResourceType*,

\- if *sl-PSFCH-CandidateResourceType* is configured as *startSubCH*,
$N_{\text{type\ }}^{\text{PSFCH}} = 1$ and the
$M_{\text{subch,\ }\text{slot}}^{\text{PSFCH}}$ PRBs are associated with
the starting sub-channel of the corresponding PSSCH;

\- if *sl-PSFCH-CandidateResourceType* is configured as *allocSubCH*,
$N_{\text{type\ }}^{\text{PSFCH}} = N_{\text{subch\ }}^{\text{PSSCH}}$
and the
${N_{\text{subch\ }}^{\text{PSSCH}} \cdot M}_{\text{subch,\ }\text{slot}}^{\text{PSFCH}}$
PRBs are associated with the $N_{\text{subch\ }}^{\text{PSSCH}}$
sub-channels of the corresponding PSSCH.

The PSFCH resources are first indexed according to an ascending order of
the PRB index, from the
${N_{\text{type\ }}^{\text{PSFCH}} \cdot M}_{\text{subch,\ }\text{slot}}^{\text{PSFCH}}$
PRBs, and then according to an ascending order of the cyclic shift pair
index from the $N_{\text{CS}}^{\text{PSFCH}}$ cyclic shift pairs.

A UE determines an index of a PSFCH resource for a PSFCH transmission in
response to a PSSCH reception as
$\left( P_{\text{ID}} + M_{\text{ID}} \right)\text{mod}R_{\text{PRB,\ }\text{CS}}^{\text{PSFCH}}$
where $P_{\text{ID}}$ is a physical layer source ID provided by SCI
format 2-A or 2-B \[5, TS 38.212\] scheduling the PSSCH reception,
$\ $and $M_{\text{ID}}$ is the identity of the UE receiving the PSSCH as
indicated by higher layers if the UE detects a SCI format 2-A with Cast
type indicator field value of \"01\"; otherwise, $M_{\text{ID}}$ is
zero.

A UE determines a $m_{\text{0}}$ value, for computing a value of cyclic
shift $\alpha$ \[4, TS 38.211\], from a cyclic shift pair index
corresponding to a PSFCH resource index and from
$N_{\text{CS}}^{\text{PSFCH}}$ using Table 16.3-1.

A UE determines a $m_{\text{cs}}$ value, for computing a value of cyclic
shift $\alpha$ \[4, TS 38.211\], as in Table 16.3-2 if the UE detects a
SCI format 2-A with Cast type indicator field value of \"01\" or \"10\",
or as in Table 16.3-3 if the UE detects a SCI format 2-B or a SCI format
2-A with Cast type indicator field value of \"11\". The UE applies one
cyclic shift from a cyclic shift pair to a sequence used for the PSFCH
transmission \[4, TS 38.211\].

### 16.3.1 UE procedure for receiving HARQ-ACK on sidelink 

A UE that transmitted a PSSCH scheduled by a SCI format 2-A or a SCI
format 2-B that indicates HARQ feedback enabled, attempts to receive
associated PSFCHs according to PSFCH resources determined as described
in clause 16.3. The UE determines an ACK or a NACK value for HARQ-ACK
information provided in each PSFCH resource as described in \[8-4, TS
38.101-4\]. The UE does not determine both an ACK value and a NACK value
at a same time for a PSFCH resource.

For each PSFCH reception occasion, from a number of PSFCH reception
occasions, the UE generates HARQ-ACK information to report to higher
layers. For generating the HARQ-ACK information, the UE can be indicated
by a SCI format to perform one of the following

**- if** the UE receives a PSFCH associated with a SCI format 2-A with
Cast type indicator field value of \"10\"

\- report to higher layers HARQ-ACK information with same value as a
value of HARQ-ACK information that the UE determines from the PSFCH
reception

**- if** the UE receives a PSFCH associated with a SCI format 2-A with
Cast type indicator field value of \"01\"

\- report an ACK value to higher layers if the UE determines an ACK
value from at least one PSFCH reception occasion from the number of
PSFCH reception occasions in PSFCH resources corresponding to every
identity $M_{\text{ID}}$ of UEs that the UE expects to receive
corresponding PSSCHs as described in clause 16.3; otherwise, report a
NACK **value to higher layers**

**- if** the PSFCH reception occasion is associated with a SCI format
2-B or a SCI format 2-A with Cast type indicator field value of \"11\"

\- report to higher layers an ACK value if the UE determines absence of
PSFCH reception for the PSFCH reception occasion; otherwise, report a
NACK value to higher layers

16.4 UE procedure for transmitting PSCCH 
----------------------------------------

A UE can be provided a number of symbols in a resource pool, by
*sl-TimeResourcePSCCH*, starting from a second symbol that is available
for SL transmissions in a slot, and a number of PRBs in the resource
pool, by *sl-FreqResourcePSCCH*, starting from the lowest PRB of the
lowest sub-channel of the associated PSSCH, for a PSCCH transmission
with a SCI format 1-A.

A UE that transmits a PSCCH with SCI format 1-A using sidelink resource
allocation mode 2 \[6, TS 38.214\] sets

\- \"Resource reservation period\" as an index in
*sl-ResourceReservePeriodList* corresponding to a reservation period
provided by higher layers \[11, TS 38.321\], if the UE is provided
*sl-MultiReserveResource*

\- the values of the frequency resource assignment field and the time
resource assignment field as described in \[6, TS 38.214\] to indicate
$N$ resources from a set $\left\{ R_{\text{y}} \right\}$ of resources
selected by higher layers as described in \[11, TS 38.321\] with $N$
smallest slot indices $y_{i}$ for $0 \leq i \leq N - 1$ such that
$y_{0} < y_{1} < \ldots < y_{N - 1} \leq y_{0} + 31$, where:

\- $N = \min\left( N_{\text{selected}},\ N_{max\_ reserve} \right)$,
where $N_{\text{selected}}$ is a number of resources in the set
$\left\{ R_{\text{y}} \right\}$ with slot indices $y_{j}$,
$0 \leq j \leq N_{\text{selected}} - 1$, such that
$y_{0} < y_{1} < \ldots < y_{N_{\text{selected}} - 1} \leq y_{0} + 31$,
and $N_{max\_ reserve}$ *is provided by sl-MaxNumPerReserve*

*-* each resource, from the set of $\left\{ R_{\text{y}} \right\}$
*resources,* corresponds to $L_{\text{subCH}}$ contiguous sub-channels
and a slot in a set of slots $\{{t'}_{y}^{\text{SL}}\}$, where
$L_{\text{subCH}}$ is the number of sub-channels available for
PSSCH/PSCCH transmission in a slot

*-*
$\left( {t'}_{0}^{\text{SL}},{t'}_{1}^{\text{SL}},{t'}_{2}^{\text{SL}},... \right)$
is a set of slots in a sidelink resource pool \[6, TS 38.214\]

*-* $y_{0}$ is an index of a slot where the PSCCH with SCI format 1-A is
transmitted.

A UE that transmits a PSCCH with SCI format 1-A using sidelink resource
allocation mode 1 \[6, TS 38.214\] sets

\- the values of the frequency resource assignment field and the time
resource assignment field for the SCI format 1-A transmitted in the
$m$-th resource for PSCCH/PSSCH transmission provided by a dynamic grant
or by a SL configured grant, where $m = \ \left\{ 1,\ldots,M \right\}$
and M is the total number of resources for PSCCH/PSSCH transmission
provided by a dynamic grant or the number of resources for PSCCH/PSSCH
transmission in a period provided by a SL configured grant type 1 or SL
configured grant type 2, as follows:

\- the frequency resource assignment field and time resource assignment
field indicate the $m$-th to $M$-th resources as described in \[6, TS
38.214\].

*For decoding of a SCI format 1-A, a UE may assume that a number of bits
provided by sl-NumReservedBits can have any value.*

16.5 UE procedure for reporting HARQ-ACK on uplink
--------------------------------------------------

A UE can be provided PUCCH resources or PUSCH resources \[12, TS
38.331\] to report HARQ-ACK information that the UE generates based on
HARQ-ACK information that the UE obtains from PSFCH receptions, or from
absence of PSFCH receptions. The UE reports HARQ-ACK information on the
primary cell of the PUCCH group, as described in clause 9, of the cell
where the UE monitors PDCCH for detection of DCI format 3\_0.

*For SL configured grant Type 1 or Type 2 PSSCH transmissions by a UE
within a time period provided by sl-PeriodCG, the UE generates one
HARQ-ACK information bit in response to the PSFCH receptions to
multiplex in a PUCCH transmission occasion that is after a last time
resource, in a set of time resources.*

*For PSSCH transmissions scheduled by a DCI format 3\_0, a UE generates
HARQ-ACK information in response to PSFCH receptions to multiplex in a
PUCCH transmission occasion that is after a last time resource in a set
of time resources provided by the DCI format 3\_0.*

From a number of PSFCH reception occasions, the UE generates HARQ-ACK
information to report in a PUCCH or PUSCH transmission. The UE can be
indicated by a SCI format to perform one of the following and the UE
constructs a HARQ-ACK codeword with HARQ-ACK information, when
applicable

\- **for one or more** PSFCH reception occasions associated with SCI
format 2-A with Cast type indicator field value of \"10\"

\- generate HARQ-ACK information with same value as a value of HARQ-ACK
information the UE determines from the last PSFCH reception from the
number of PSFCH reception occasions corresponding to PSSCH transmissions
or, if the UE determines that a PSFCH is not received at the last PSFCH
reception occasion and ACK is not received in any of previous PSFCH
reception occasions, generate NACK

\- **for one or more** PSFCH reception occasions associated with SCI
format 2-A with Cast type indicator field value of \"01\"

\- generate ACK if the UE determines ACK from at least one PSFCH
reception occasion, from the number of PSFCH reception occasions
corresponding to PSSCH transmissions, in PSFCH resources corresponding
to every identity $M_{\text{ID}}$ of the UEs that the UE expects to
receive the PSSCH, as described in clause 16.3; otherwise, generate NACK

\- **for one or more** PSFCH reception occasions associated with SCI
format 2-B or SCI format 2-A with Cast type indicator field value of
\"11\"

\- generate ACK when the UE determines absence of PSFCH reception for
the last PSFCH reception occasion from the number of PSFCH reception
occasions corresponding to PSSCH transmissions; otherwise, generate NACK

After a UE transmits PSSCHs and receives PSFCHs in corresponding PSFCH
resource occasions, the priority value of HARQ-ACK information is same
as the priority value of the PSSCH transmissions that is associated with
the PSFCH reception occasions providing the HARQ-ACK information.

The UE generates a NACK when, due to prioritization, as described in
clause 16.2.4, the UE does not receive PSFCH in any PSFCH reception
occasion associated with a PSSCH transmission in a resource provided by
a DCI format 3\_0 or, for a configured grant, in a resource provided in
a single period and for which the UE is provided a PUCCH resource to
report HARQ-ACK information. The priority value of the NACK is same as
the priority value of the PSSCH transmission.

The UE generates a NACK when, due to prioritization as described in
clause 16.2.4, the UE does not transmit a PSSCH in any of the resources
provided by a DCI format 3\_0 or, for a configured grant, in any of the
resources provided in a single period and for which the UE is provided a
PUCCH resource to report HARQ-ACK information. The priority value of the
NACK is same as the priority value of the PSSCH that was not transmitted
due to prioritization.

The UE generates an ACK if the UE does not transmit a PSCCH with a SCI
format 1-A scheduling a PSSCH in any of the resources provided by a
configured grant in a single period and for which the UE is provided a
PUCCH resource to report HARQ-ACK information. The priority value of the
ACK is same as the largest priority value among the possible priority
values for the configured grant.

The UE generates an ACK if the UE does not transmit a PSCCH with a SCI
format 1-A scheduling a PSSCH in any of the resources provided by a DCI
format 3\_0 and for which the UE is provided a PUCCH resource to report
HARQ-ACK information. The priority value of the ACK is same as the
largest priority value among the possible priority values for the
dynamic grant.

For reporting HARQ-ACK information on uplink corresponding to one or
multiple PSSCH transmissions with a corresponding SCI format with the
field \'HARQ feedback enabled/disabled indicator\' set to disabled, the
UE generates HARQ-ACK information with the contents instructed by higher
layer. The priority value of the HARQ-ACK information is same as the
priority value of the PSSCH transmission.

A UE does not expect to be provided PUCCH resources or PUSCH resources
to report HARQ-ACK information that start earlier than
$T_{\text{prep}} =$
$\left( N + 1 \right) \bullet \left( 2048 + 144 \right) \bullet \kappa \bullet 2^{- \mu} \bullet T_{c}$
after the end of a last symbol of a last PSFCH reception occasion, from
a number of PSFCH reception occasions that the UE generates HARQ-ACK
information to report in a PUCCH or PUSCH transmission, where

\- $\kappa$ and $T_{c}$ are defined in \[4, TS 38.211\]

\- $\mu = min(\mu_{\text{SL}},\mu_{\text{UL}})$, where $\mu_{\text{SL}}$
is the SCS configuration of the SL BWP and $\mu_{\text{UL}}$ is the SCS
configuration of the active UL BWP on the primary cell

\- $N$ is determined from $\mu$ according to Table 16.5-1

Table 16.5-1: Values of $\mathbf{N}$

  $$\mathbf{\mu}$$   $$\mathbf{N}$$
  ------------------ ----------------
  0                  14

  2                  28
  3                  32

For DCI format 3\_0, if present, the PSFCH-to-HARQ feedback timing
indicator field values map to values for a set of number of slots
provided by *sl-PSFCH-ToPUCCH* as defined in Table 16.5-2.

  ----------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------- --------------------------------------------

With reference to slots for PUCCH transmissions and for a number of
PSFCH reception occasions ending in slot $n$, the UE provides the
generated HARQ-ACK information in a PUCCH transmission within slot
$n + k$, subject to the overlapping conditions in clause 9.2.5, where
$k$ is a number of slots indicated by a PSFCH-to-HARQ feedback timing
indicator field, if present, in a DCI format indicating a slot for PUCCH
transmission to report the HARQ-ACK information, or $k$ is provided by
*sl-PSFCH-ToPUCCH* for a transmission scheduled by a DCI format or for a
SL configured grant type 2, or by *sl-PSFCH-ToPUCCH-CG-Type1 for a SL
configured grant type 1*. $k = 0$ corresponds to a last slot for a PUCCH
transmission that would overlap with the last PSFCH reception occasion
assuming that the start of the sidelink frame is same as the start of
the downlink frame \[4, TS 38.211\].

For a PSSCH transmission by a UE that is scheduled by a DCI format, or
for a SL configured grant Type 2 PSSCH transmission activated by a DCI
format, *the DCI format indicates to the UE that a PUCCH resource is not
provided when a value of the PUCCH resource indicator field is zero and
a value of PSFCH-to-HARQ feedback timing indicator field, if present, is
zero. For a SL configured grant Type 2 PSSCH transmission without a
corresponding PDCCH, the DCI format activating the SL configured grant
Type 2 indicates to the UE that a PUCCH resource is not provided when a
value of the PUCCH resource indicator field is zero and a value of
PSFCH-to-HARQ feedback timing indicator field, if present, is zero. For
a* SL configured grant Type 1 *PSSCH* transmission*, a PUCCH resource
can be provided* by *sl-N1PUCCH-AN and sl-PSFCH-ToPUCCH-CG-Type1. For
transmission of HARQ-ACK information corresponding only to a SL
configured grant Type 2 PSSCH transmission,* including the PSSCH
transmission(s) associated with the corresponding activation DCI format
3[\_]{.underline}0, *a UE can be provided a PUCCH resource by
sl-N1PUCCH-AN-Type2. If a PUCCH resource is not provided, the UE does
not transmit a PUCCH with generated HARQ-ACK information from PSFCH
reception occasions.*

For a PUCCH transmission with HARQ-ACK information, a UE determines a
PUCCH resource after determining a set of PUCCH resources from up to
four PUCCH resource sets provided by *sl-PUCCH-Config*, for
$O_{\text{UCI}}$ HARQ-ACK information bits, as described in clause
9.2.1. The PUCCH resource determination is based on a PUCCH resource
indicator field \[5, TS 38.212\] in a last DCI format 3\_0, excluding
DCI format 3\_0 for the SL configured grant Type 2 activation, among the
DCI formats 3\_0 that have a value of a PSFCH-to-HARQ feedback timing
indicator field indicating a same slot for the PUCCH transmission, that
the UE detects and for which the UE transmits corresponding HARQ-ACK
information in the PUCCH where, for PUCCH resource determination,
detected DCI formats are indexed in an ascending order across PDCCH
monitoring occasion indexes.

The PUCCH resource indicator field values map to values of a set of
PUCCH resource indexes, as described in clause 9.2.3.

A UE transmits a PUCCH with HARQ-ACK information using PUCCH format 0 or
PUCCH format 1 or PUCCH format 2 or PUCCH format 3 or PUCCH format 4 as
described in clause 9.2.3.

A UE does not expect to multiplex HARQ-ACK information for more than one
SL configured grants in a same PUCCH.

A priority value of a PUCCH transmission with one or more sidelink
HARQ-ACK information bits is the smallest priority value for the one or
more HARQ-ACK information bits.

In the following, the CRC for DCI format 3\_0 is scrambled with a
SL-RNTI or a SL-CS-RNTI.

### 16.5.1 Type-1 HARQ-ACK codebook determination 

This clause applies if the UE is configured with
*pdsch-HARQ-ACK-Codebook = semi-static*.

If a UE is configured a SL configured grant Type 1, and the UE is
configured a SL configured grant Type 2 or to monitor PDCCH for
detection of DCI format 3\_0 with CRC scrambled by SL-RNTI or
SL-CS-RNTI, and the UE is provided a set of slot timing values $K_{1}$
associated with a SL BWP by *sl-PSFCH-ToPUCCH* and
*sl-PSFCH-ToPUCCH-CG-Type1*, the *sl-PSFCH-ToPUCCH-CG-Type1* is one of
*sl-PSFCH-ToPUCCH*.

A UE reports HARQ-ACK information for PSSCH transmissions with
corresponding PSFCH reception occasions in slot $n$ only in a HARQ-ACK
codebook that the UE includes in a PUCCH or PUSCH transmission in slot
$n + k$, where $k$ is a number of slots indicated by the PSFCH-to-HARQ
feedback timing indicator field in a DCI format 3\_0 scheduling the
PSSCH transmissions, or by a value of PSFCH-to-HARQ feedback timing
indicator field in a DCI format 3\_0 activating a SL configured grant
Type-2 transmission, or by a value of *sl-PSFCH-ToPUCCH-CG-Type1* for a
SL configured grant Type-1. If the UE reports HARQ-ACK information for
the PSSCH transmissions with corresponding PSFCH reception occasions in
a slot other than slot $n + k$, the UE sets a value for each
corresponding HARQ-ACK information bit to NACK.

If a UE reports HARQ-ACK information in a PUCCH only for

\- PSFCH reception occasions associated with PSSCH transmissions
scheduled by a DCI format 3\_0 with counter SAI field value of 1, or

\- PSFCH reception occasions associated with PSSCH transmissions
corresponding to a SL configured grant

within a set $M_{A}$ of occasions for candidate PSSCH transmissions with
corresponding PSFCH reception occasions as determined in clause
16.5.1.1, the UE determines a HARQ-ACK codebook only for the PSFCH
reception occasion associated with PSSCH transmissions scheduled by DCI
format 3\_0 or only for the PSFCH reception occasion associated with
PSSCH transmissions corresponding to a SL configured grant according to
corresponding set $M_{A}$ of occasions, where a value of a counter SAI
in DCI format 3\_0 is according to Table 16.5.2.1-1. Otherwise, the
procedures in clause 16.5.1.1 and in clause 16.5.1.2 for a HARQ-ACK
codebook determination apply.

#### 16.5.1.1 Type-1 HARQ-ACK codebook in physical uplink control channel

For a SL BWP on a carrier, and an active UL BWP on the primary cell, as
described in clause 12, a UE determines a set $M_{A}$ of occasions for
candidate PSSCH transmissions with corresponding PSFCH reception
occasions for which the UE can multiplex corresponding HARQ-ACK
information in a PUCCH transmission in slot $n_{U}$. The determination

a\) a set of slot timing values $K_{1}$ associated with the SL BWP where
$K_{1}$ is provided by *sl-PSFCH-ToPUCCH* for DCI format 3\_0 or by
*sl-PSFCH-ToPUCCH-CG-Type1*

b\) the ratio $2^{\mu_{\text{S}\text{L}} - \mu_{\text{UL}}}$ between the
sidelink SCS configuration $\mu_{\text{S}\text{L}}$ and the uplink SCS
configuration $\mu_{\text{UL}}$ provided by *subcarrierSpacing* in
*SL-BWP-Config* *or SL-BWP-ConfigCommon* and *BWP-Uplink* for the SL BWP
and the active UL BWP, respectively

c\) a configured sidelink resource pool bitmap

d\) a value of a period of PSFCH transmission occasion resources for a
sidelink resource pool provided by a respective *sl-PSFCH-Period*

For the set of slot timing values $K_{1}$, the UE determines a set
$M_{A}$ of occasions for candidate PSSCH transmissions with
corresponding PSFCH reception occasions according to the following
pseudo-code.

Set $j = 0$ - index of occasion for candidate PSSCH transmissions with
corresponding PSFCH reception occasions

Set $M_{A} = \varnothing$

Set C$\left( K_{1} \right)$ to the cardinality of set $K_{1}$

Set $k = 0$ -- index of slot timing values $K_{1,k}$, in descending
order of the slot timing values, in set $K_{1}$

Set $N_{\text{PSFCH}}$ to the value of the period of PSFCH transmission
occasion resources for the sidelink resource pool

The cardinality of the set $M_{A}$ defines a total number $M$ of
occasions for candidate PSSCH transmissions with corresponding PSFCH
reception occasions corresponding to the HARQ-ACK information bits. A UE
determines
${\widetilde{o}}_{0}^{\text{ACK}},{\widetilde{o}}_{1}^{\text{ACK}},\ldots,{\widetilde{o}}_{O_{\text{ACK}} - 1}^{\text{ACK}}$
HARQ-ACK information bits, for a total number of $O_{\text{ACK}}$
HARQ-ACK information bits as ${\widetilde{o}}_{j}^{\text{ACK}}$ =
HARQ-ACK information bit for candidate PSSCH transmission with index $j$
with corresponding PSFCH reception, for $0\  \leq j < M$, as described
in clause 16.5. If the UE does not transmit a PSSCH in an occasion for
candidate PSSCH transmission with corresponding PSFCH reception
occasion, due to the UE not detecting a corresponding DCI format 3\_0,
the UE generates a NACK value for the occasion for candidate PSSCH
transmission with corresponding PSFCH reception occasion.

If $O_{\text{ACK}} \leq 11$, the UE determines a number of HARQ-ACK
information bits $n_{\text{HARQ} - \text{ACK}}$ for obtaining a
transmission power for a PUCCH, as described in clause 7.2.1, as
$n_{\text{HARQ-ACK}} = \sum_{m = 0}^{M - 1}N_{m}^{\text{received}}$
where $N_{m}^{\text{received}}$ is a number of HARQ-ACK information bits
determined for corresponding PSSCH transmissions with corresponding
PSFCH reception occasions in PSFCH reception occasion $m$.

#### 16.5.1.2 Type-1 HARQ-ACK codebook in physical uplink shared channel

If a UE would multiplex HARQ-ACK information in a PUSCH transmission
that is not scheduled by a DCI format or is scheduled by a DCI format
without an SAI field, then

\- if the UE

*-* has not received any PDCCH with a DCI format 3\_0 scheduling PSSCH
transmissions with corresponding PSFCH reception occasions that the UE
transmits corresponding HARQ-ACK information in the PUSCH, based on a
value of a respective PSFCH-to-HARQ feedback timing indicator field in a
DCI format scheduling the PSSCH transmissions or on the value of
PSFCH-to-HARQ feedback timing indicator field in a DCI format 3\_0
activating a SL configured grant Type 2 transmission, or

*-* has not been provided PSSCH resources with corresponding PSFCH
reception occasions that the UE transmits corresponding HARQ-ACK
information based on the value of *sl-PSFCH-ToPUCCH-CG-Type1* for a SL
configured grant Type 1,

> then in any of the set $M_{A}$ of occasions for candidate PSSCH
> transmissions with corresponding PSFCH reception occasions, as
> described in clause 16.5.1.1*,* the UE does not multiplex HARQ-ACK
> information in the PUSCH transmission;

\- else the UE generates the HARQ-ACK codebook as described in clause
16.5.1.1, unless the UE generates HARQ-ACK information only for

*-* PSFCH reception occasions associated with PSSCH transmissions
corresponding to a SL configured grant, or

*-* PSFCH reception occasions associated with PSSCH transmissions that
are scheduled by DCI format 3\_0 with a counter SAI field value of 1,

> in the set $M_{A}$ of occasions for candidate PSSCH transmissions with
> corresponding PSFCH reception occasions, in which case the UE
> generates HARQ-ACK information only for the PSFCH reception occasions
> as described in clause 16.5.1.

A UE sets to NACK value in the HARQ-ACK codebook any HARQ-ACK
information corresponding to PSFCH reception occasions associated with
PSSCH transmissions scheduled by a DCI format 3\_0 that the UE detects
in a PDCCH monitoring occasion that starts after a PDCCH monitoring
occasion where the UE detects a DCI format scheduling the PUSCH
transmission.

If a UE multiplexes HARQ-ACK information in a PUSCH transmission that is
scheduled by a DCI format that includes a SAI field, the UE generates
the HARQ-ACK codebook as described in clause 16.5.1.1 when a value of
the SAI field in the DCI format is $V_{T - \text{SAI}}^{\text{UL}} = 1$.
The UE does not generate a HARQ-ACK codebook for multiplexing in the
PUSCH transmission when $V_{T - \text{SAI}}^{\text{UL}} = 0$ unless the
UE generates HARQ-ACK information only for

\- PSFCH reception occasions associated with PSSCH transmissions
corresponding to a SL configured grant, or

\- PSFCH reception occasions associated with PSSCH transmissions that
are scheduled by a DCI format 3\_0 with a counter SAI field value of 1,

> in the set $M_{A}$ of occasions for candidate PSSCH transmissions with
> corresponding PSFCH reception occasions as described in clause 16.5.1.

$V_{T - \text{SAI}}^{\text{UL}} = 0$ if the SAI field in the DCI format
is set to \'0\'; otherwise, $V_{T - \text{SAI}}^{\text{UL}} = 1$.

### 16.5.2 Type-2 HARQ-ACK codebook determination 

This clause applies if the UE is configured with
*pdsch-HARQ-ACK-Codebook = dynamic*.

#### 16.5.2.1 Type-2 HARQ-ACK codebook in physical uplink control channel

A UE determines monitoring occasions for PDCCH with DCI format 3\_0 for
scheduling PSSCH transmissions with associated PSFCH reception occasions
on an active DL BWP of a serving cell $c$, as described in clause 10.1,
and for which the UE transmits HARQ-ACK information in a same PUCCH in
slot $n$ based on

\- PSFCH-to-HARQ feedback timing indicator field values, or a value
provided by *sl-PSFCH-ToPUCCH-CG-Type1,* for PUCCH transmission with
HARQ-ACK information in slot $n$ in response to PSFCH receptions;

\- time gap field in DCI format 3\_0 for scheduling PSSCH transmissions
with associated PSFCH receptions;

\- time resource assignment in DCI format 3\_0 for scheduling PSSCH
transmissions with associated PSFCH receptions;

\- a configured sidelink resource pool bitmap;

\- a value of a period of PSFCH resources provided in *sl-PSFCH-Period;*

\- a value of a minimum time gap provided in *sl-MinTimeGapPSFCH.*

The set of PDCCH monitoring occasions for DCI format 3\_0 for scheduling
PSSCH transmissions with associated PSFCH reception occasions is defined
as the PDCCH monitoring occasions in the active DL BWP of the configured
serving cell, indexed in ascending order of start time of the associated
search space sets. The cardinality of the set of PDCCH monitoring
occasions defines a total number $M$ of PDCCH monitoring occasions. A UE
is not expected to receive a DCI format 3\_0 with CRC scrambled by
SL-RNTI and a DCI format 3\_0 with CRC scrambled by SL-CS-RNTI for
scheduling retransmission corresponding to a SL configured grant Type 1
or a sidelink configured grant Type 2 simultaneously in a same
monitoring occasion.

A value of a counter sidelink assignment indicator (SAI) field in DCI
format 3\_0, excluding DCI format 3\_0 for the SL configured grant Type
2 activation, denotes an accumulative number of PDCCH monitoring
occasions where PSSCH transmissions with associated PSFCH receptions are
scheduled, up to a current PDCCH monitoring occasion, in ascending order
of PDCCH monitoring occasion index $m$, where $0 \leq m < M$.

Denote by $V_{C - \text{SAI},m}^{\text{SL}}$ the value of the counter
SAI in DCI format 3\_0 in PDCCH monitoring occasion $m$ according to
Table 16.5.2.1-1.

If the UE transmits HARQ-ACK information in a PUCCH in slot $n$, the UE
determines the
${\widetilde{o}}_{0}^{\text{ACK}},{\widetilde{o}}_{1}^{\text{ACK}},\ldots,{\widetilde{o}}_{O_{\text{ACK}} - 1}^{\text{ACK}}$,
for a total number of $O_{\text{ACK}}$ HARQ-ACK information bits,
according to the following pseudo-code:

Set $m = 0$ -- PDCCH with DCI format 3\_0 monitoring occasion index:
lower index corresponds to earlier PDCCH with DCI format 3\_0 monitoring
occasion

Set $j = 0$

Set $V_{\text{temp}} = 0$

Set $V_{s} = \varnothing$

Set $M$ to the number of PDCCH monitoring occasions

while $m < M$

> if PDCCH monitoring occasion $m$ is before an active UL BWP change on
> the PCell

$m = M$;

else

> if there is a PSFCH reception occasion associated with a PSSCH
> transmission scheduled by a DCI format in PDCCH monitoring occasion
> $m$

if $V_{C - \text{SAI},m}^{\text{SL}} \leq V_{\text{temp}}$

> $j = j + 1$;

end if

> $V_{\text{temp}} = V_{C - \text{SAI},m}^{\text{SL}}$
>
> ${\widetilde{o}}_{4j + V_{C - SAI,m}^{\text{SL}} - 1}^{\text{ACK}}$ =

end if

end if

$m = m + 1$;

end while

> $O_{\text{ACK}} = 4 \cdot j + V_{\text{temp}}$

${\widetilde{o}}_{i}^{\text{ACK}} = NACK$ for any
$i\  \in \left\{ 0,1,\ldots,O_{\text{ACK}} - 1 \right\}\backslash V_{s}\ $

> if a SL configured grant Type 1 is configured for a UE, or a SL

end if

If $O_{\text{ACK}} \leq 11$, the UE determines a number of HARQ-ACK
information bits $n_{\text{HARQ} - \text{ACK}}$ for obtaining a
transmission power for a PUCCH, as described in clause 7.2.1, as

$$n_{\text{HARQ-ACK}} = \left( V_{\text{SAI},m_{\text{last}}}^{\text{SL}} - U_{\text{SAI}} \right)\text{mod}4 + \sum_{m = 0}^{M - 1}N_{m}^{\text{received}} + N_{\text{CG}}$$

where

\- $V_{\text{S}\text{AI},m_{\text{last}}}^{\text{S}\text{L}}$ is a value
of a counter SAI field in a last DCI format 3\_0, excluding the DCI
format 3\_0 activating a SL configured grant, scheduling PSSCH
transmissions associated with PSFCH reception occasions that the UE
detects within the $M$ PDCCH monitoring occasions

\- $V_{\text{S}\text{AI},m_{\text{last}}}^{\text{S}\text{L}} = 0$ if the
UE does not detect any DCI format 3\_0, excluding the DCI format 3\_0
activating a SL configured grant, scheduling PSSCH transmissions
associated with PSFCH reception occasions in any of the $M$ PDCCH
monitoring occasions

\- $U_{\text{S}\text{AI}}$ is a total number of DCI format 3\_0,
excluding the DCI format 3\_0 activating a SL configured grant,
scheduling PSSCH transmissions associated with PSFCH reception
occasions, that the UE detects within the $M$ PDCCH monitoring
occasions. $U_{\text{S}\text{AI}} = 0$ if the UE does not detect any DCI
format 3\_0, excluding the DCI format 3\_0 activating a SL configured
grant, scheduling PSSCH transmissions with associated PSFCH reception
occasions in any of the $M$ PDCCH monitoring occasions

\- $N_{m}^{\text{received}}$ is a number of DCI format 3\_0, excluding
the DCI format 3\_0 activating a SL configured grant, scheduling PSSCH
transmissions with associated PSFCH reception occasions that the UE
detects in PDCCH monitoring occasion $m$

\- $N_{\text{CG}}$ is a number of SL configured grants for which the UE
transmits corresponding HARQ-ACK information in a same PUCCH as for
HARQ-ACK information corresponding to PSFCH reception occasions
associated with *PSSCH transmissions* scheduled by a dynamic grant
within the $M$ PDCCH monitoring occasions

#### 16.5.2.2 Type-2 HARQ-ACK codebook in physical uplink shared channel

If a UE would multiplex HARQ-ACK information in a PUSCH transmission
that is not scheduled by a DCI format or is scheduled by a DCI format
without an SAI field, then

*- if the* UE

*-* has not received any PDCCH within the monitoring occasions for DCI
format 3\_0 for scheduling PSSCH with corresponding PSFCH reception
occasions on any serving cell, and

*-* does not have HARQ-ACK information in response to a PSSCH
transmission with corresponding PSFCH reception occasions associated
with a SL configured grant to multiplex in the PUSCH, as described in
clause 16.5.2.1*,*

> the UE does not multiplex HARQ-ACK information in the PUSCH
> transmission;

\- else, the UE generates and multiplexes in the PUSCH transmission the
HARQ-ACK codebook as described in clause 16.5.2.1.

If a UE multiplexes HARQ-ACK information in a PUSCH transmission that is
scheduled by a DCI format that includes a SAI field, the UE generates
the HARQ-ACK codebook as described in clause 16.5.2.1, with the
following modifications:

\- For the pseudo-code for the HARQ-ACK codebook generation in clause
16.5.2.1, after the completion of the $m$ loop, the UE sets
$V_{\text{temp}} = V_{\text{T-}\text{SAI}}^{\text{UL}}$ where
$V_{\text{T-}\text{SAI}}^{\text{UL}}$ is the value of the SAI field in
the DCI format according to Table 16.5.2.2-1.

If a UE

\- is scheduled for a PUSCH transmission by a DCI format that includes a
SAI field with value $V_{\text{T-SAI}}^{\text{UL}} = 4$, and

\- has not received any PDCCH within the monitoring occasions for PDCCH
with DCI format 3\_0 for scheduling PSSCH with corresponding PSFCH
reception occasions on a serving cell, and

\- does not have HARQ-ACK information in response to PSFCH reception
occasions associated with a SL configured grant to multiplex in the
PUSCH, as described in clause 16.5.2.1,

the UE does not multiplex HARQ-ACK information in the PUSCH
transmission.

16.6 UE procedure for LTE sidelink transmission
-----------------------------------------------

If the UE detects a DCI format 3\_1 with CRC scrambled by SL
Semi-Persistent Scheduling V-RNTI in slot $n$, the DCI format 3\_1
activates or releases an LTE sidelink SPS configuration that is
indicated by a SL SPS configuration index field \[5, TS 38.212\]. If the
DCI format 3\_1 activates an SL SPS configuration, the UE procedure for
transmitting a PSCCH and a PSSCH is as described in \[13, TS 36.213\]
except that a transmission starts no earlier than
$T_{\text{DCI}} - \frac{N_{\text{TA}}}{2} \times T_{C} \times 10^{3} + X + \left( 4 + m \right)$
ms, where $T_{\text{DCI}}$ is a start time of slot $n$, $N_{\text{TA}}$
and $T_{C}$ are defined in \[4, TS 38.211\], $X$ is a value indicated by
a Timing offset field in DCI format 3\_1, and $m$ is a value indicated
by SL index field in DCI format 3\_1 if the SL index field is present;
otherwise, $m = 0$.

16.7 Operation for in-device coexistence
----------------------------------------

If a UE would transmit or receive a first channel/signal using E-UTRA
radio access and a second channel/signal using NR radio access, when

\- the first channel/signal and the second channel/signal are
time-division multiplexed, and

\- the UE knows the frame indexes of the first channel/signal and the
frame indexes of the second channel/signal,

the UE transmits or receives each channel/signal so that the subframe
boundary of the second channel/signal is aligned with the subframe
boundary of the first channel/signal where the subframe boundary
alignment is achieved by UE implementation means.
