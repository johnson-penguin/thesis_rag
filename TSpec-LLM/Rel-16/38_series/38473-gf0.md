3 Definitions and abbreviations
===============================

3.1 Definitions
---------------

**elementary procedure:** F1AP consists of Elementary Procedures (EPs).
An Elementary Procedure is a unit of interaction between gNB-CU and
gNB-DU. These Elementary Procedures are defined separately and are
intended to be used to build up complete sequences in a flexible manner.
If the independence between some EPs is restricted, it is described
under the relevant EP description. Unless otherwise stated by the
restrictions, the EPs may be invoked independently of each other as
standalone procedures, which can be active in parallel. The usage of
several F1AP EPs together is specified in stage 2 specifications (e.g.,
TS 38.470 \[2\]).

An EP consists of an initiating message and possibly a response message.
Two kinds of EPs are used:

\- **Class 1:** Elementary Procedures with response (success and/or
failure).

\- **Class 2:** Elementary Procedures without response.

For Class 1 EPs, the types of responses can be as follows:

Successful:

\- A signalling message explicitly indicates that the elementary
procedure successfully completed with the receipt of the response.

Unsuccessful:

\- A signalling message explicitly indicates that the EP failed.

\- On time supervision expiry (i.e., absence of expected response).

Successful and Unsuccessful:

\- One signalling message reports both successful and unsuccessful
outcome for the different included requests. The response message used
is the one defined for successful outcome.

Class 2 EPs are considered always successful.

**BH RLC channel:** as defined in TS 38.300 \[6\].

**Conditional handover:** as defined in TS 38.300 \[6\].

**Conditional PSCell Change:** as defined in TS 37.340 \[7\].

***DAPS Handover**: as defined in TS 38.300 \[6\].*

**EN-DC operation:** Used in this specification when the F1AP is applied
for gNB-CU and gNB-DU in E-UTRAN.

**gNB: as defined in TS 38.300 \[6\].**

**gNB-CU: as defined in TS 38.401 \[4\].**

**gNB-CU UE F1AP ID:** as defined in TS 38.401 \[4\].

**IAB-MT**: as defined in TS 38.300 \[6\].

**IAB-DU**: as defined in TS 38.300 \[6\].

**IAB-node**: as defined in TS 38.300 \[6\].

**Public network integrated NPN:** as defined in TS 23.501 \[21\].

**Stand-alone Non-Public Network**: as defined in TS 23.501 \[21\].

**UE-associated signalling:** When F1AP messages associated to one UE
uses the UE-associated logical F1-connection for association of the
message to the UE in gNB-DU and gNB-CU.

**UE-associated logical F1-connection: The UE-associated logical
F1-connection uses the identities *GNB-CU UE F1AP ID* and *GNB-DU UE
F1AP ID* according to the definition in TS 38.401 \[4\]. For a received
UE associated F1AP message the** gNB-CU identifies **the** associated UE
based on the ***GNB-CU UE F1AP ID*** IE and the gNB-DU identifies the
associated UE based on the ***GNB-DU UE F1AP ID* IE***.* **The
UE-associated logical F1-connection may exist before the F1 UE context
is setup in gNB-DU.**

4.1 Procedure specification principles
--------------------------------------

The principle for specifying the procedure logic is to specify the
functional behaviour of the terminating node exactly and completely. Any
rule that specifies the behaviour of the originating node shall be
possible to be verified with information that is visible within the
system.

The following specification principles have been applied for the
procedure text in clause 8:

\- The procedure text discriminates between:

1\) Functionality which \"shall\" be executed.

The procedure text indicates that the receiving node \"shall\" perform a
certain function Y under a certain condition. If the receiving node
supports procedure X but cannot perform functionality Y requested in the
REQUEST message of a Class 1 EP, the receiving node shall respond with
the message used to report unsuccessful outcome for this procedure,
containing an appropriate cause value.

2\) Functionality which \"shall, if supported\" be executed.

The procedure text indicates that the receiving node \"shall, if
supported,\" perform a certain function Y under a certain condition. If
the receiving node supports procedure X, but does not support
functionality Y, the receiving node shall proceed with the execution of
the EP, possibly informing the requesting node about the not supported
functionality.

\- Any required inclusion of an optional IE in a response message is
explicitly indicated in the procedure text. If the procedure text does
not explicitly indicate that an optional IE shall be included in a
response message, the optional IE shall not be included. For
requirements on including *Criticality Diagnostics* IE, see clause 10.

4.2 Forwards and backwards compatibility
----------------------------------------

The forwards and backwards compatibility of the protocol is assured by
mechanism where all current and future messages, and IEs or groups of
related IEs, include ID and criticality fields that are coded in a
standard format that will not be changed in the future. These parts can
always be decoded regardless of the standard version.

4.3 Specification notations
---------------------------

For the purposes of the present document, the following notations apply:

Procedure When referring to an elementary procedure in the specification
the Procedure Name is written with the first letters in each word in
upper case characters followed by the word \"procedure\", e.g. Handover
Preparation procedure.

Message When referring to a message in the specification the MESSAGE
NAME is written with all letters in upper case characters followed by
the word \"message\", e.g. HANDOVER REQUEST message.

IE When referring to an information element (IE) in the specification
the *Information Element Name* is written with the first letters in each
word in upper case characters and all letters in Italic font followed by
the abbreviation \"IE\", e.g. *E-RAB ID* IE.

Value of an IE When referring to the value of an information element
(IE) in the specification the \"Value\" is written as it is specified in
the specification enclosed by quotation marks, e.g. \"Value\".

5 F1AP services
===============

F1AP provides the signalling service between gNB-DU and the gNB-CU that
is required to fulfil the F1AP functions described in clause 7. F1AP
services are divided into two groups:

> Non UE-associated services: They are related to the whole F1 interface
> instance between the gNB-DU and gNB-CU utilising a non UE-associated
> signalling connection.
>
> UE-associated services: They are related to one UE. F1AP functions
> that provide these services are associated with a UE-associated
> signalling connection that is maintained for the UE in question.

Unless explicitly indicated in the procedure specification, at any
instance in time one protocol endpoint shall have a maximum of one
ongoing F1AP procedure related to a certain UE.

All considerations of gNB-DU in this specification also apply to the
IAB-DU and IAB-donor-DU, unless stated otherwise. All considerations of
gNB-CU in this specification apply to the IAB-donor-CU as well, unless
stated otherwise.

6 Services expected from signalling transport
=============================================

The signalling connection shall provide in sequence delivery of F1AP
messages. F1AP shall be notified if the signalling connection breaks.

7 Functions of F1AP
===================

The functions of F1AP are described in TS 38.470 \[2\].

8 F1AP procedures
=================

8.1 List of F1AP Elementary procedures
--------------------------------------

In the following tables, all EPs are divided into Class 1 and Class 2

8.2 Interface Management procedures
-----------------------------------

### 8.2.1 Reset

#### 8.2.1.1 General

The purpose of the Reset procedure is to initialise or re-initialise the
F1AP UE-related contexts, in the event of a failure in the gNB-CU or
gNB-DU. This procedure does not affect the application level
configuration data exchanged during, e.g., the F1 Setup procedure.

The procedure uses non-UE associated signalling.

#### 8.2.1.2 Successful Operation

##### 8.2.1.2.1 Reset Procedure Initiated from the gNB-CU

Figure 8.2.1.2.1-1: Reset procedure initiated from the gNB-CU.
Successful operation

In the event of a failure at the gNB-CU, which has resulted in the loss
of some or all transaction reference information, a RESET message shall
be sent to the gNB-DU.

At reception of the RESET message the gNB-DU shall release all allocated
resources on F1 and radio resources related to the UE association(s)
indicated explicitly or implicitly in the RESET message and remove the
indicated UE contexts including F1AP ID.

After the gNB-DU has released all assigned F1 resources and the UE F1AP
IDs for all indicated UE associations which can be used for new
UE-associated logical F1-connections over the F1 interface, the gNB-DU
shall respond with the RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message. The gNB-DU does not
need to wait for the release of radio resources to be completed before
returning the RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message.

*If the RESET message contains the UE-associated logical F1-connection
list IE, then:*

*- The gNB-DU shall use the gNB-CU UE F1AP ID* IE and/or the *gNB-DU UE
F1AP ID* IE to explicitly identify the UE association(s) to be reset.

\- The *gNB-DU* shall include in the RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message, for each
UE association to be reset, the *UE-associated logical F1-connection
Item* IE in the *UE-associated logical F1-connection list* IE. The
*UE-associated logical F1-connection Item* IEs shall be in the same
order as received in the RESET message and shall include also unknown
UE-associated logical F1-connections. Empty *UE-associated logical
F1-connection Item* IEs, received in the RESET message, may be omitted
in the RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message.

\- If the *gNB-CU UE F1AP ID* IE is included in the *UE-associated
logical F1-connection Item* IE for a UE association, the gNB-DU shall
include the *gNB-CU UE F1AP ID* IE in the corresponding *UE-associated
logical F1-connection Item* IE in the RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message.

\- If the *gNB-DU UE F1AP ID* IE is included in the *UE-associated
logical F1-connection Item* IE for a UE association, the gNB-DU shall
include the *gNB-DU UE F1AP ID* IE in the corresponding *UE-associated
logical F1-connection Item* IE in the RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message.

**Interactions with other procedures:**

If the RESET message is received, any other ongoing procedure (except
for another Reset procedure) on the same F1 interface related to a UE
association, indicated explicitly or implicitly in the RESET message,
shall be aborted.

##### 8.2.1.2.2 Reset Procedure Initiated from the gNB-DU

Figure 8.2.1.2.2-1: Reset procedure initiated from the gNB-DU.
Successful operation

In the event of a failure at the gNB-DU, which has resulted in the loss
of some or all transaction reference information, a RESET message shall
be sent to the gNB-CU.

At reception of the RESET message the gNB-CU shall release all allocated
resources on F1 related to the UE association(s) indicated explicitly or
implicitly in the RESET message and remove the F1AP ID for the indicated
UE associations.

After the gNB-CU has released all assigned F1 resources and the UE F1AP
IDs for all indicated UE associations which can be used for new
UE-associated logical F1-connections over the F1 interface, the gNB-CU
shall respond with the RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message.

If the RESET message contains the *UE-associated logical F1-connection
list* IE, then:

\- The gNB-CU shall use the *gNB-CU UE F1AP ID* IE and/or the *gNB-DU UE
F1AP ID* IE to explicitly identify the UE association(s) to be reset.

\- The gNB-CU shall in the RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message include, for each
UE association to be reset, the *UE-associated logical F1-connection*
*Item* IE in the *UE-associated logical F1-connection list* IE. The
*UE-associated logical F1-connection Item* IEs shall be in the same
order as received in the RESET message and shall include also unknown
UE-associated logical F1-connections. Empty *UE-associated logical
F1-connection Item* IEs, received in the RESET message, may be omitted
in the RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message.

\- If the *gNB-CU UE F1AP ID* IE is included in the *UE-associated
logical F1-connection Item* IE for a UE association, the gNB-CU shall
include the *gNB-CU UE F1AP ID* IE in the corresponding *UE-associated
logical F1-connection Item* IE in the RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message.

\- If the *gNB-DU UE F1AP ID* IE is included in a *UE-associated logical
F1-connection Item* IE for a UE association, the gNB-CU shall include
the *gNB-DU UE F1AP ID* IE in the corresponding *UE-associated logical
F1-connection Item* IE in the RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message.

**Interactions with other procedures:**

If the RESET message is received, any other ongoing procedure (except
for another Reset procedure) on the same F1 interface related to a UE
association, indicated explicitly or implicitly in the RESET message,
shall be aborted.

#### 8.2.1.3 Abnormal Conditions

Not applicable.

### 8.2.2 Error Indication

#### 8.2.2.1 General

The Error Indication procedure is initiated by a node in order to report
detected errors in one incoming message, provided they cannot be
reported by an appropriate failure message.

If the error situation arises due to reception of a message utilising UE
associated signalling, then the Error Indication procedure uses UE
associated signalling. Otherwise the procedure uses non-UE associated
signalling.

#### 8.2.2.2 Successful Operation

Figure 8.2.2.2-1: Error Indication procedure, gNB-CU originated.
Successful operation

Figure 8.2.2.2-2: Error Indication procedure, gNB-DU originated.
Successful operation

When the conditions defined in clause 10 are fulfilled, the Error
Indication procedure is initiated by an ERROR INDICATION message sent
from the receiving node.

The ERROR INDICATION message shall contain at least either the *Cause*
IE or the *Criticality Diagnostics* IE. In case the Error Indication
procedure is triggered by utilising UE associated signalling the *gNB-CU
UE F1AP ID* IE and *gNB-DU UE F1AP ID* IE shall be included in the ERROR
INDICATION message. If one or both of the *gNB-CU UE F1AP ID* IE and the
*gNB-DU UE F1AP ID* IE are not correct, the cause shall be set to
appropriate value, e.g., \"Unknown or already allocated gNB-CU UE F1AP
ID\", \"Unknown or already allocated gNB-DU UE F1AP ID\" or \"Unknown or
inconsistent pair of UE F1AP ID\".

#### 8.2.2.3 Abnormal Conditions 

Not applicable.

### 8.2.3 F1 Setup 

#### 8.2.3.1 General

The purpose of the F1 Setup procedure is to exchange application level
data needed for the gNB-DU and the gNB-CU to correctly interoperate on
the F1 interface. This procedure shall be the first F1AP procedure
triggered for the F1-C interface instance after a TNL association has
become operational.

NOTE: If F1-C signalling transport is shared among multiple F1-C
interface instances, one F1 Setup procedure is issued per F1-C interface
instance to be setup, i.e. several F1 Setup procedures may be issued via
the same TNL association after that TNL association has become
operational.

NOTE: Exchange of application level configuration data also applies
between the gNB-DU and the gNB-CU in case the DU does not broadcast
system information other than for radio frame timing and SFN, as
specified in the TS 37.340 \[8\]. How to use this information when this
option is used is not explicitly specified.

The procedure uses non-UE associated signalling.

This procedure erases any existing application level configuration data
in the two nodes and replaces it by the one received. This procedure
also re-initialises the F1AP UE-related contexts (if any) and erases all
related signalling connections in the two nodes like a Reset procedure
would do.

#### 8.2.3.2 Successful Operation

Figure 8.2.3.2-1: F1 Setup procedure: Successful Operation

The gNB-DU initiates the procedure by sending a F1 SETUP REQUEST message
including the appropriate data to the gNB-CU. The gNB-CU responds with a
F1 SETUP RESPONSE message including the appropriate data.

The exchanged data shall be stored in respective node and used as long
as there is an operational TNL association. When this procedure is
finished, the F1 interface is operational and other F1 messages may be
exchanged.

If the F1 SETUP REQUEST message contains the *gNB-DU Name* IE, the
gNB-CU may use this IE as a human readable name of the gNB-DU. If the F1
SETUP REQUEST message contains the *Extended gNB-DU Name* IE, the gNB-CU
may use this IE as a human readable name of the gNB-DU and shall ignore
the *gNB-DU Name* IE if included.

If the F1 SETUP RESPONSE message contains the *gNB-CU Name* IE, the
gNB-DU may use this IE as a human readable name of the gNB-CU. If the F1
SETUP RESPONSE message contains the *Extended gNB-CU Name* IE, the
gNB-DU may use this IE as a human readable name of the gNB-CU and shall
ignore the *gNB-CU Name* IE if included.

If the F1 SETUP REQUEST message contains the *gNB-DU Served Cells List*
IE, the gNB-CU shall take into account as specified in TS 38.401 \[4\].

For NG-RAN, the gNB-DU shall include the *gNB-DU System Information* IE
and the *TAI Slice Support List* IE in the F1 SETUP REQUEST message.

The gNB-CU may include the *Cells to be Activated List* IE in the F1
SETUP RESPONSE message. The *Cells to be Activated List* IE includes a
list of cells that the gNB-CU requests the gNB-DU to activate. The
gNB-DU shall activate the cells included in the *Cells to be Activated
List* IE and reconfigure the physical cell identity for cells for which
the *NR PCI* IE is included.

If *Cells to be Activated List Item* IE is included in the F1 SETUP
RESPONSE message, and the information for the cell indicated by the *NR
CGI* IE includes the *IAB Info IAB-donor-CU* IE, the gNB-DU shall, if
supported, apply the *IAB STC Info* IE therein to the indicated cell.

For NG-RAN, the gNB-CU shall include the *gNB-CU System Information* IE
in the F1 SETUP RESPONSE message.

For NG-RAN, the gNB-DU may include the *RAN Area Code* IE in the F1
SETUP REQUEST message. The gNB-CU may use it according to TS 38.300
\[6\].

For NG-RAN, the gNB-CU may include *Available PLMN List* IE, and
optionally also *Extended Available PLMN List* IE in the F1 SETUP
RESPONSE message, if the available PLMN(s) are different from what
gNB-DU has provided in F1 SETUP REQUEST message, gNB-DU shall take this
into account and only broadcast the PLMN(s) included in the received
Available PLMN list(s).

For NG-RAN, the gNB-CU may include *Available SNPN ID List* IE in the F1
SETUP RESPONSE message. If the available SNPN(s) are different from what
gNB-DU has provided in F1 SETUP REQUEST message, gNB-DU shall take this
into account and only broadcast the SNPN(s) included in the received
Available SNPN ID list.

The *Latest* *RRC Version Enhanced* IE shall be included in the F1 SETUP
REQUEST message and in the F1 SETUP RESPONSE message.

If in F1 SETUP REQUEST message, the *Cell Direction* IE is present, the
gNB-CU should use it to understand whether the cell is for UL or DL
only. If in F1 SETUP REQUEST message, the *Cell Direction* IE is omitted
in the *Served Cell Information* IE it shall be interpreted as that the
Cell Direction is Bi-directional.

If the *Intended TDD DL-UL Configuration IE* is present in the F1 SETUP
REQUEST message, the receiving gNB-CU shall use the received information
for Cross Link Interference management and/or NR-DC power coordination.
The gNB-CU may merge the Intended TDD DL-UL Configuration information
received from two or more gNB-DUs. The gNB-CU shall consider the
received *Intended TDD DL-UL Configuration* content valid until
reception of an update of the IE for the same cell(s).

If the *Aggressor gNB Set* *ID* IE is included in the *Served Cell
Information* IE in the F1 SETUP REQUEST message, the gNB-CU shall, if
supported, take it into account.

If the *Victim gNB Set* *ID* IE is included in the *Served Cell
Information* IE in the F1 SETUP REQUEST message, the gNB-CU shall, if
supported, take it into account.

If the F1 SETUP REQUEST message contains the Transport Layer Address
Info IE, the gNB-CU shall, if supported, take into account for IPSec
tunnel establishment.

If the *SFN Offset* IE is contained in the *Served Cell Information* IE
in the F1 SETUP REQUEST message, the gNB-CU shall, if supported, use
this information to deduce the SFN0 offset of the reported cell.

If the F1 SETUP RESPONSE message contains the *Transport Layer Address
Info* IE, the gNB-DU shall, if supported, take into account for IPSec
tunnel establishment.

If the F1 SETUP RESPONSE message contains the *Uplink BH Non-UP Traffic
Mapping* IE, the gNB-DU shall, if supported, consider the information
therein for mapping of non-UP uplink traffic.

If the *BAP Address* IE is included in the F1 SETUP REQUEST, the
receiving gNB-CU shall, if supported, consider the information therein
for discovering the collocation of an IAB-DU and an IAB-MT.

If the F1 SETUP REQUEST message is received from an IAB-donor-DU, the
gNB-CU shall, if supported, include the *BAP Address* IE in the F1 SETUP
RESPONSE message.

NOTE: How to identify the IAB-donor-DU is up to gNB-CU implementation.

If the F1 SETUP RESPONSE message contains the *BAP Address* IE, the
gNB-DU shall, if supported, store the received BAP address and use it as
specified in TS 38.340 \[30\].

If the *NR PRACH Configuration List* IE is included in the *Served Cell
Information* IE contained in the F1 SETUP REQUEST message, the gNB-CU
may store the information, and forward it to other RAN nodes for RACH
optimisation. If the *L139 Info IE* included in the *NR PRACH
Configuration List* IE is present, it shall contain the *Root Sequence
Index* IE.

#### 8.2.3.3 Unsuccessful Operation

Figure 8.2.3.3-1: F1 Setup procedure: Unsuccessful Operation

If the gNB-CU cannot accept the setup, it should respond with a F1 SETUP
FAILURE and appropriate cause value.

If the F1 SETUP FAILURE message includes the *Time To Wait* IE, the
gNB-DU shall wait at least for the indicated time before reinitiating
the F1 setup towards the same gNB-CU.

#### 8.2.3.4 Abnormal Conditions

Not applicable.

### 8.2.4 gNB-DU Configuration Update

#### 8.2.4.1 General

The purpose of the gNB-DU Configuration Update procedure is to update
application level configuration data needed for the gNB-DU and the
gNB-CU to interoperate correctly on the F1 interface. This procedure
does not affect existing UE-related contexts, if any. The procedure uses
non-UE associated signalling.

NOTE: Update of application level configuration data also applies
between the gNB-DU and the gNB-CU in case the DU does not broadcast
system information other than for radio frame timing and SFN, as
specified in the TS 37.340 \[8\]. How to use this information when this
option is used is not explicitly specified.

#### 8.2.4.2 Successful Operation

![](media/image9.emf){width="4.970138888888889in"
height="1.5777777777777777in"}

Figure 8.2.4.2-1: gNB-DU Configuration Update procedure: Successful
Operation

The gNB-DU initiates the procedure by sending a GNB-DU CONFIGURATION
UPDATE message to the gNB-CU including an appropriate set of updated
configuration data that it has just taken into operational use. The
gNB-CU responds with GNB-DU CONFIGURATION UPDATE ACKNOWLEDGE message to
acknowledge that it successfully updated the configuration data. If an
information element is not included in the GNB-DU CONFIGURATION UPDATE
message, the gNB-CU shall interpret that the corresponding configuration
data is not changed and shall continue to operate the F1-C interface
with the existing related configuration data.

The updated configuration data shall be stored in both nodes and used as
long as there is an operational TNL association or until any further
update is performed.

If g*NB-DU ID* IE is contained in the GNB-DU CONFIGURATION UPDATE
message for a newly established SCTP association, the gNB-CU will
associate this association with the related gNB-DU.

If *Served Cells To Add Item* IE is contained in the GNB-DU
CONFIGURATION UPDATE message, the gNB-CU shall add cell information
according to the information in the *Served Cell Information IE*. For
NG-RAN, the gNB-DU shall include the *gNB-DU System Information* IE.

If *Served Cells To Modify Item* IE is contained in the GNB-DU
CONFIGURATION UPDATE message, the gNB-CU shall modify information of
cell indicated by *Old* *NR CGI* IE according to the information in the
*Served Cell Informatio*n IE and overwrite the served cell information
for the affected served cell. Further, if the *gNB-DU System
Information* IE is present the gNB-CU shall store and replace any
previous information received.

If *Served Cells To Delete Item* IE is contained in the GNB-DU
CONFIGURATION UPDATE message, the gNB-CU shall delete information of
cell indicated by *Old* *NR CGI* IE.

If *Cells Status Item* IE is contained in the GNB-DU CONFIGURATION
UPDATE message, the gNB-CU shall update the information about the cells,
as described in TS 38.401 \[4\]. If if the *Switching Off Ongoing* IE is
present in the *Cells Status Item* IE, contained in the GNB-DU
CONFIGURATION UPDATE message, and the corresponding *Service State IE*
is set to \"Out-of-Service\", the gNB-CU shall ignore the *Switching Off
Ongoing* IE.

If *Cells to be Activated List Item* IE is contained in the GNB-DU

shall ignore those non-associated candidate cells.

### 8.3.3 UE Context Release (gNB-CU initiated)

#### 8.3.3.1 General

The purpose of the UE Context Release procedure is to enable the gNB-CU
to order the release of the UE-associated logical connection or
candidate cells in conditional handover or conditional PSCell change.
The procedure uses UE-associated signalling.

Figure 8.3.3.2-1: UE Context Release (gNB-CU initiated) procedure.
Successful operation

The gNB-CU initiates the procedure by sending the UE CONTEXT RELEASE
COMMAND message to the gNB-DU.

Upon reception of the UE CONTEXT RELEASE COMMAND message, the gNB-DU
shall release all related signalling and user data transport resources
and reply with the UE CONTEXT RELEASE COMPLETE message.

If the *old gNB-DU UE F1AP ID* IE is included in the UE CONTEXT RELEASE
COMMAND message, the gNB-DU shall additionally release the UE context
associated with the old gNB-DU UE F1AP ID.

If the UE CONTEXT RELEASE COMMAND message contains the *RRC-Container
IE*, the gNB-DU shall send the RRC container to the UE via the SRB
indicated by the *SRB ID* IE.

If the UE CONTEXT RELEASE COMMAND message includes the *Execute
Duplication* IE, the gNB-DU shall perform CA based duplication, if
configured, for the SRB for the included *RRC-Container* IE.

If the *Candidate Cells To Be Cancelled List* IE is included in the UE
CONTEXT RELEASE COMMAND message, the gNB-DU shall consider that the
gNB-CU is cancelling only the conditional handover or conditional PSCell
change associated to the cells identified by the included NR CGIs and
associated to the UE-associated signaling identifie*d* by the *gNB-CU UE
F1AP ID IE and the gNB-DU UE F1AP ID IE*.

**Interactions with UE Context Setup procedure:**

The UE Context Release procedure may be performed before the UE Context
Setup procedure to release an existing UE-associated logical
F1-connection and related resources in the gNB-DU, e.g. when gNB-CU
rejects UE access it shall trigger UE Context Release procedure with the
cause value of UE rejection.

#### 8.3.3.4 Abnormal Conditions

If one or more candidate cells in the *Candidate Cells To Be Cancelled
List* IE included in the UE CONTEXT RELEASE COMMAND message were not
prepared using the same UE-associated signalling connection, the gNB-DU
shall ignore those non-associated candidate cells.

### 8.3.4 UE Context Modification (gNB-CU initiated)

#### 8.3.4.1 General

The purpose of the UE Context Modification procedure is to modify the
established UE Context, e.g., establishing, modifying and releasing
radio resources or sidelink resources. This procedure is also used to
command the gNB-DU to stop data transmission for the UE for mobility
(see TS 38.401 \[4\]). The procedure uses UE-associated signalling.

9 Elements for F1AP Communication
=================================

9.1 General
-----------

Subclauses 9.2 and 9.3 present the F1AP message and IE definitions in
tabular format. The corresponding ASN.1 definition is presented in
subclause 9.4. In case there is contradiction between the tabular format
and the ASN.1 definition, the ASN.1 shall take precedence, except for
the definition of conditions for the presence of conditional IEs, where
the tabular format shall take precedence.

The messages have been defined in accordance to the guidelines specified
in TR 25.921 \[14\].

When specifying IEs which are to be represented by bitstrings, if not
otherwise specifically stated in the semantics description of the
concerned IE or elsewhere, the following principle applies with regards
to the ordering of bits:

\- The first bit (leftmost bit) contains the most significant bit (MSB);

\- The last bit (rightmost bit) contains the least significant bit
(LSB);

\- When importing bitstrings from other specifications, the first bit of
the bitstring contains the first bit of the concerned information;

The following attributes are used for the tabular description of the
messages and information elements: Presence, Range Criticality and
Assigned Criticality. Their definition and use can be found in TS 38.413
\[3\].

9.2 Message Functional Definition and Content

The meaning of the different cause values is described in the following
table. In general, \"not supported\" cause values indicate that the
related capability is missing. On the other hand, \"not available\"
cause values indicate that the related capability is present, but
insufficient resources were available to perform the requested action.

  ------------------------------------------------ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Radio Network Layer cause                        Meaning
  Unspecified                                      Sent for radio network layer cause when none of the specified cause values applies.
  RL Failure-RLC                                   The action is due to an RL failure caused by exceeding the maximum number of ARQ retransmissions.
  Unknown or already allocated gNB-CU UE F1AP ID   The action failed because the gNB-CU UE F1AP ID is either unknown, or (for a first message received at the gNB-CU) is known and already allocated to an existing context.
  Unknown or already allocated gNB-DU UE F1AP ID   The action failed because the gNB-DU UE F1AP ID is either unknown, or (for a first message received at the gNB-DU) is known and already allocated to an existing context.
  Unknown or inconsistent pair of UE F1AP ID       The action failed because both UE F1AP IDs are unknown, or are known but do not define a single UE context.
  Interaction with other procedure                 The action is due to an ongoing interaction with another procedure.
  Not supported QCI Value                          The action failed because the requested QCI is not supported.
  Action Desirable for Radio Reasons               The reason for requesting the action is radio related.
  No Radio Resources Available                     The cell(s) in the requested node don't have sufficient radio resources available.
  Procedure cancelled                              The sending node cancelled the procedure due to other urgent actions to be performed.
  Normal Release                                   The action is due to a normal release of the UE (e.g. because of mobility) and does not indicate an error.
  Cell Not Available                               The action failed due to no cell available in the requested node.
  RL Failure-others                                The action is due to an RL failure caused by other radio link failures than exceeding the maximum number of ARQ retransmissions.
  UE rejection                                     The action is due to gNB-CU's rejection of a UE access request.
  Resources not available for the slice(s)         The requested resources are not available for the slice(s).
  AMF initiated abnormal release                   The release is triggered by an error in the AMF or in the NAS layer.
  Release due to Pre-Emption                       Release is initiated due to pre-emption.
  PLMN not served by the gNB-CU                    The PLMN indicated by the UE is not served by the gNB-CU.
  Multiple DRB ID Instances                        The action failed because multiple instances of the same DRB had been provided.
  Unknown DRB ID                                   The action failed because the DRB ID is unknow.
  Multiple BH RLC CH ID Instances                  The action failed because multiple instances of the same BH RLC CH ID had been provided. This cause value is only applicable to IAB.
  Unknown BH RLC CH ID                             The action failed because the BH RLC CH ID is unknown. This cause value is only applicable to IAB.
  CHO-CPC resources to be changed                  The gNB-DU requires gNB-CU to replace, i.e. overwrite the configuration of indicated candidate target cell.
  NPN not supported                                The action fails because the indicated SNPN is not supported in the node.
  NPN access denied                                The action is due to rejection of a UE access request for NPN.
  gNB-CU Cell Capacity Exceeded                    The number of cells requested to be added was exceeding maximum cell capacity in the gNB-CU.
  **Report Characteristics Empty**                 The action failed because there is no measurement object in the report characteristics.

#### 9.3.1.22 Bit Rate

This IE indicates the number of bits delivered by NG-RAN in UL or to
NG-RAN in DL within a period of time, divided by the duration of the
period. It is used, for example, to indicate the maximum or guaranteed
bit rate for a GBR QoS flow, or an aggregated maximum bit rate.

  ------------------- -------------- ----------- -------------------------------------- ---------------------------

#### 9.3.1.23 Transaction ID

The *Transaction ID IE* uniquely identifies a procedure among all
ongoing parallel procedures of the same type initiated by the same
protocol peer. Messages belonging to the same procedure use the same
Transaction ID. The Transaction ID is determined by the initiating peer
of a procedure.

NOTE: If F1-C signalling transport is shared among multiple interface
instances, the Transaction ID is allocated so that it can be associated
with an F1-C interface instance. The Transaction ID may identify more
than one interface instance.

#### 9.3.1.98 BAP layer BH RLC channel mapping Information List

This IE includes the information used by the IAB-DU to perform the BH
RLC channel mapping when forwarding traffic on BAP sublayer.

When this IE is included in the UE-associated F1AP signalling for
setting up or modifying a BH RLC channel, it contains either the
*Prior-Hop BAP Address* IE and the *Ingress BH RLC CH ID* IE to
configure a mapping in downlink direction, or the *Next-Hop BAP address*
IE and the *Egress BH RLC CH ID* IE to configure a mapping in uplink
direction. This IE indicates the BH RLC channel served by the collocated
IAB-MT.

When this IE is included in the non-UE-associated F1AP signalling, it
shall contain the *Prior-Hop BAP Address* IE, the *Ingress BH RLC CH ID*
IE, the *Next-Hop BAP address* IE and the *Egress BH RLC CH ID* IE.

9.4 Message and Information Element Abstract Syntax (with ASN.1)
----------------------------------------------------------------

### 9.4.1 General

F1AP ASN.1 definition conforms to ITU-T Recommendation X.691 \[5\],
ITU-T Recommendation X.680 \[12\] and ITU-T Recommendation X.681 \[13\].

The ASN.1 definition specifies the structure and content of F1AP
messages. F1AP messages can contain any IEs specified in the object set
definitions for that message without the order or number of occurrence
being restricted by ASN.1. However, for this version of the standard, a
sending entity shall construct an F1AP message according to the PDU
definitions module and with the following additional rules:

\- IEs shall be ordered (in an IE container) in the order they appear in
object set definitions.

\- Object set definitions specify how many times IEs may appear. An IE
shall appear exactly once if the presence field in an object has value
\"mandatory\". An IE may appear at most once if the presence field in an
object has value \"optional\" or \"conditional\". If in a tabular format
there is multiplicity specified for an IE (i.e., an IE list) then in the
corresponding ASN.1 definition the list definition is separated into two
parts. The first part defines an IE container list where the list
elements reside. The second part defines list elements. The IE container
list appears as an IE of its own. For this version of the standard an IE
container list may contain only one kind of list elements.

> NOTE: In the above \"IE\" means an IE in the object set with an
> explicit ID. If one IE needs to appear more than once in one object
> set, then the different occurrences will have different IE IDs.

If an F1AP message that is not constructed as defined above is received,
this shall be considered as Abstract Syntax Error, and the message shall
be handled as defined for Abstract Syntax Error in clause 10.

### 9.4.2 Usage of private message mechanism for non-standard use

The private message mechanism for non-standard use may be used:

> \- for special operator- (and/or vendor) specific features considered
> not to be part of the basic functionality, i.e., the functionality
> required for a complete and high-quality specification in order to
> guarantee multivendor interoperability;
>
> \- by vendors for research purposes, e.g., to implement and evaluate
> new algorithms/features before such features are proposed for
> standardisation.

The private message mechanism shall not be used for basic functionality.
Such functionality shall be standardised.

9.5 Message Transfer Syntax
---------------------------

F1AP shall use the ASN.1 Basic Packed Encoding Rules (BASIC-PER) Aligned
Variant as transfer syntax, as specified in ITU-T Recommendation X.691
\[5\].

9.6 Timers
----------

10 Handling of unknown, unforeseen and erroneous protocol data
==============================================================

Clause 10 of TS 38.413 \[3\] is applicable for the purposes of the
present document, with the following additions for non-UE-associated
procedures:

\- In case of Abstract Syntax Error, when reporting the *Criticality
Diagnostics* IE for not comprehended IE/IEgroups or missing IE/IE
groups, the *Transaction ID* IE shall also be included;

\- In case of Logical Error, when reporting the *Criticality
Diagnostics* IE, the *Transaction ID* IE shall also be included;

\- In case of Logical Error in a response message of a Class 1
procedure, or failure to comprehend *Transaction ID* IE from a received
message, the procedure shall be considered as unsuccessfully terminated
or not terminated (e.g., transaction ID unknown in response message),
and local error handling shall be initiated.
