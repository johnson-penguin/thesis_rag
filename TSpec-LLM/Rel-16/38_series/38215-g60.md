4 Control of UE/NG-RAN measurements
===================================

In this clause the general measurement control concept of the higher
layers is briefly described to provide an understanding on how L1
measurements are initiated and controlled by higher layers.

With the measurement specifications L1 provides measurement capabilities
for the UE and NG-RAN. These measurements can be classified in different
reported measurement types: intra-frequency, inter-frequency,
inter-system, traffic volume, quality and UE internal measurements.

In the L1 measurement definitions, see clause 5, the measurements are
categorised as measurements in the UE or measurements in the NG-RAN.

5 Measurement capabilities for NR

### 5.1.1 SS reference signal received power (SS-RSRP)

+--------------------+------------------------------------------------+
| **Definition**     | SS reference signal received power (SS-RSRP)   |
|                    | is defined as the linear average over the      |
|                    | power contributions (in \[W\]) of the resource |
|                    | elements that carry secondary synchronization  |
|                    | signals. The measurement time resource(s) for  |
|                    | SS-RSRP are confined within SS/PBCH Block      |
|                    | Measurement Time Configuration (SMTC) window   |
|                    | duration. If SS-RSRP is used for L1-RSRP as    |
|                    | configured by reporting configurations as      |
|                    | defined in TS 38.214 \[6\], the measurement    |
|                    | time resources(s) restriction by SMTC window   |
|                    | duration is not applicable.                    |
|                    |                                                |
|                    | For SS-RSRP determination demodulation         |
|                    | reference signals for physical broadcast       |
|                    | channel (PBCH) and, if indicated by higher     |
|                    | layers, CSI reference signals in addition to   |
|                    | secondary synchronization signals may be used. |
|                    | SS-RSRP using demodulation reference signal    |
|                    | for PBCH or CSI reference signal shall be      |
|                    | measured by linear averaging over the power    |
|                    | contributions of the resource elements that    |
|                    | carry corresponding reference signals taking   |
|                    | into account power scaling for the reference   |
|                    | signals as defined in TS 38.213 \[5\]. If      |
|                    | SS-RSRP is not used for L1-RSRP, the           |
|                    | additional use of CSI reference signals for    |
|                    | SS-RSRP determination is not applicable.       |
|                    |                                                |
|                    | SS-RSRP shall be measured only among the       |
|                    | reference signals corresponding to SS/PBCH     |
|                    | blocks with the same SS/PBCH block index and   |
|                    | the same physical-layer cell identity.         |
|                    |                                                |
|                    | If SS-RSRP is not used for L1-RSRP and         |
|                    | higher-layers indicate certain SS/PBCH blocks  |
|                    | for performing SS-RSRP measurements, then      |
|                    | SS-RSRP is measured only from the indicated    |
|                    | set of SS/PBCH block(s).                       |
|                    |                                                |
|                    | For frequency range 1, the reference point for |
|                    | the SS-RSRP shall be the antenna connector of  |
|                    | the UE. For frequency range 2, SS-RSRP shall   |
|                    | be measured based on the combined signal from  |
|                    | antenna elements corresponding to a given      |
|                    | receiver branch. For frequency range 1 and 2,  |
|                    | if receiver diversity is in use by the UE, the |
|                    | reported SS-RSRP value shall not be lower than |
|                    | the corresponding SS-RSRP of any of the        |
|                    | individual receiver branches.                  |
+--------------------+------------------------------------------------+
| **Applicable for** | If SS-RSRP is used for L1-RSRP,                |
|                    |                                                |

|                    | Otherwise,                                     |
|                    |                                                |

NOTE 1: The number of resource elements within the measurement period
that are used by the UE to determine SS-RSRP is left up to the UE
implementation with the limitation that corresponding measurement
accuracy requirements have to be fulfilled.

NOTE 2: The power per resource element is determined from the energy
received during the useful part of the symbol, excluding the CP.

| **Definition**     | CSI reference signal received power            |
|                    | (CSI-RSRP), is defined as the linear average   |
|                    | over the power contributions (in \[W\]) of the |
|                    | resource elements of the antenna port(s) that  |
|                    | carry CSI reference signals configured for     |
|                    | RSRP measurements within the considered        |
|                    | measurement frequency bandwidth in the         |

NOTE 1: The number of resource elements within the considered
measurement frequency bandwidth and within the measurement period that
are used by the UE to determine CSI-RSRP is left up to the UE
implementation with the limitation that corresponding measurement
accuracy requirements have to be fulfilled.

NOTE 2: The power per resource element is determined from the energy
received during the useful part of the symbol, excluding the CP.

+--------------------+------------------------------------------------+
| **Definition**     | SS signal-to-noise and interference ratio      |
|                    | (SS-SINR), is defined as the linear average    |

|                    | average of the noise and interference power    |
|                    | contribution (in \[W\]). If SS-SINR is used    |
|                    | for L1-SINR reporting with dedicated           |
|                    | interference measurement resources, the        |
|                    | interference and noise is measured over        |
|                    | resource(s) indicated by higher layers as      |
|                    | described in TS 38.214 \[6\]. Otherwise, the   |
|                    | interference and noise are measured over the   |

| **Definition**     | CSI signal-to-noise and interference ratio     |
|                    | (CSI-SINR), is defined as the linear average   |
|                    | over the power contribution (in \[W\]) of the  |
|                    | resource elements carrying CSI reference       |
|                    | signals divided by the linear average of the   |
|                    | noise and interference power contribution (in  |
