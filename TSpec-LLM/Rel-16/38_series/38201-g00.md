================================

4.1 Relation to other layers
----------------------------

### 4.1.1 General protocol architecture

The radio interface described in this specification covers the interface
between the User Equipment (UE) and gNB, between gNBs, between IAB-node
DU and IAB-node MT/UE, and between UEs. The radio interface is composed
of the Layer 1, 2 and 3. The TS 38.200 series describes the Layer 1
(Physical Layer) specifications. Layers 2 and 3 are described in the
38.300 series.

height="2.0729166666666665in"}

Figure 1: Radio interface protocol architecture around the physical
layer

Figure 1 shows the NR radio interface protocol architecture around the
physical layer (Layer 1). The physical layer interfaces the Medium
Access Control (MAC) sub-layer of Layer 2 and the Radio Resource Control
(RRC) Layer of Layer 3. The circles between different layer/sub-layers
indicate Service Access Points (SAPs). The physical layer offers a
transport channel to MAC. The transport channel is characterized by how
the information is transferred over the radio interface. MAC offers
different logical channels to the Radio Link Control (RLC) sub-layer of
Layer 2. A logical channel is characterized by the type of information
transferred.

### 4.1.2 Service provided to higher layers

The physical layer offers data transport services to higher layers. The
access to these services is through the use of a transport channel via
the MAC sub-layer. Details are specified in \[2\].

4.2 General description of layer 1
----------------------------------

### 4.2.1 Multiple access

The multiple access scheme for the NR physical layer is based on
Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) with a cyclic prefix
(CP). For uplink, Discrete Fourier Transform-spread-OFDM (DFT-s-OFDM)
with a CP is also supported. To support transmission in paired and
unpaired spectrum, both Frequency Division Duplex (FDD) and Time
Division Duplex (TDD) are enabled.

The Layer 1 is defined in a bandwidth agnostic way based on resource
blocks, allowing the NR Layer 1 to adapt to various spectrum
allocations. A resource block spans 12 sub-carriers with a given
sub-carrier spacing.

The radio frame has a duration of 10ms and consists of 10 sub-frames
with a sub-frame duration of 1ms. A sub-frame is formed by one or
multiple adjacent slots, each having 14 adjacent symbols. Further
details on the frame structure are specified in \[2\].

### 4.2.2 Physical channels and modulation

The physical channels defined in the downlink are:

\- the Physical Downlink Shared Channel (PDSCH),

\- the Physical Downlink Control Channel (PDCCH),

\- the Physical Broadcast Channel (PBCH),

The physical channels defined in the uplink are:

\- the Physical Random Access Channel (PRACH),

\- the Physical Uplink Shared Channel (PUSCH),

\- and the Physical Uplink Control Channel (PUCCH).

The physical channels defined in the sidelink are:

\- the Physical Sidelink Broadcast Channel (PSBCH),

\- the Physical Sidelink Control Channel (PSCCH),

\- the Physical Sidelink Feedback Channel (PSFCH),

\- and the Physical Sidelink Shared Channel (PSSCH).

In addition, signals are defined as reference signals, primary and
secondary synchronization signals.

The modulation schemes supported are

\- in the downlink, QPSK, 16QAM, 64QAM, and 256QAM,

\- in the uplink, QPSK, 16QAM, 64QAM and 256QAM for OFDM with a CP and
π/2-BPSK, QPSK, 16QAM, 64QAM and 256QAM for DFT-s-OFDM with a CP

### 4.2.3 Channel coding

The channel coding scheme for transport blocks is quasi-cyclic LDPC
codes with 2 base graphs and 8 sets of parity check matrices for each
base graph, respectively. One base graph is used for code blocks larger
than certain sizes or with initial transmission code rate higher than
thresholds; otherwise, the other base graph is used. Before the LDPC
coding, for large transport blocks, the transport block is segmented
into multiple code blocks with equal size. The channel coding scheme for
PBCH and control information is Polar coding based on nested sequences.
Puncturing, shortening and repetition are used for rate matching.
Further details of channel coding schemes are specified in \[4\].

### 4.2.4 Physical layer procedures

There are several Physical layer procedures involved. Such procedures
covered by the physical layer are;

\- Cell search

\- Power control

\- Uplink synchronisation and Uplink timing control

\- Random access related procedures

\- HARQ related procedures

\- Beam management and CSI related procedures

\- Sidelink related procedures

\- Channel access procedures

Through the control of physical layer resources in the frequency domain
as well as in the time and power domains, implicit support of
interference coordination is provided in NR.

### 4.2.5 Physical layer measurements

Radio characteristics are measured by the UE and the network and
reported to higher layers. These include, e.g. measurements for intra-
and inter-frequency handover, inter RAT handover, timing measurements,
and measurements for RRM.

Measurements for inter-RAT handover are defined in support of handover
to E-UTRA.
