=======

The present document contains the description and definition of the
measurements performed by network or the UE that are transferred over
the standardised interfaces in order to support NR radio link
operations, radio resource management (RRM), network operations and
maintenance (OAM), minimization of drive tests (MDT) and self-organising
networks (SON).

Only the differences relative to TS 28.552 v16.2.0 \[2\] are specified
in this specification.

by network implementation. All the performance measurements for gNB
defined in TS 28.552 \[2\] 5.1 can be calculated into per PLMN ID level
by network implementation. Per QoS level refers to per mapped 5QI for NR
SA or per QCI for EN-DC.

#### 4.2.1.2 Packet delay

##### 4.2.1.2.1 General

Packet delay includes RAN part of delay and CN part of delay.

The RAN part of DL packet delay measurement comprises:

\- D1 (DL delay in over-the-air interface), referring to Average delay
DL air-interface in TS 28.552 \[2\] 5.1.1.1.1.

\- D2 (DL delay on gNB-DU), referring to Average delay in RLC sublayer
of gNB-DU in TS 28.552 \[2\] 5.1.3.3.3.

\- D3 (DL delay on F1-U), referring to Average delay on F1-U in TS
28.552 \[2\] 5.1.3.3.2.

\- D4 (DL delay in CU-UP), referring to Average delay DL in CU-UP in TS
28.552 \[2\] 5.1.3.3.1.

The DL packet delay measurements, i.e. D1 (the DL delay in over-the-air
interface ), D2 (the DL delay in gNB-DU), D3 (the DL delay on F1-U) and
D4 (the DL delay in CU-UP), should be measured per DRB per UE.

NOTE: The delay measurements D1, D2 and D4 are also applicable for EUTRA
in case of EN-DC related DL delay measurements on the MN side.

The RAN part (including UE) of UL packet delay measurement comprises:

\- D1 (UL PDCP packet average delay, as defined in clause 4.3.1.1).

\- D2.1 (average over-the-air interface packet delay, as defined in
4.2.1.2.2).

\- D2.2 (average RLC packet delay, as defined in 4.2.1.2.3).

\- D2.3 (average delay UL on F1-U, it is measured using the same metric
as the average delay DL on F1-U defined in TS 28.552 \[2\] clause
5.1.3.3.2).

\- D2.4 (average PDCP re-ordering delay, as defined in 4.2.1.2.4).

The UL packet delay measurements, i.e. D1(UL PDCP packet average delay),
D2.1(average over-the-air interface packet delay), D2.2(average RLC
packet delay), D2.3(average delay UL on F1-U) and D2.4(average PDCP
re-ordering delay), should be measured per DRB per UE. The unit of D1,
D2.1, D2.2, D2.3 and D2.4 is 0.1ms.

NOTE: The delay measurements D1, D2.1, D2.2 and D2.4 are also applicable
for EUTRA in case of EN-DC related UL delay measurements on the MN side.

For non CU-UP and DU split case, RAN part of packet delay excludes the
delay at FI-U interface, i.e. D2.3 and D3.

If network disables the PDCP re-ordering function, the value of Average
PDCP re-ordering delay i.e. D2.4 should be set to 0.

For the QoS monitoring in TS 23.501 \[4\], RAN informs the RAN part of
UL packet delay measurement, or the RAN part of DL packet delay
measurement, or both to the CN.

##### 4.2.1.2.2 Average over-the-air interface packet delay in the UL per DRB per UE

The objective of this measurement is to measure air interface UL packet
delay for OAM performance observability or for QoS verification of MDT
or for the QoS monitoring as defined in TS 23.501 \[4\].

##### 4.2.1.4.1 General

The objective of the measurement is to measure number of stored inactive
UE contexts for OAM performance observability. It is intended to be part
of indication about the memory consumption in a RAN node.

The measurement is obtained by sampling at a pre-defined interval, the
number of inactive UE contexts for each gNB and then taking the
arithmetic mean or maximum value over pre-defined time duration.

### 4.3.1 Packet delay

#### 4.3.1.1 UL PDCP Packet Average Delay per DRB per UE

The objective of this measurement performed by UE is to measure Packet
Delay in Layer PDCP for QoS verification of MDT or for the QoS
monitoring as defined in TS 23.501 \[4\].

| Definition | PDCP Packet Delay in the UL per DRB. This measurement  |
|            | refers to PDCP queuing delay for DRBs in the UE, which |

|            | SAP until the UL grant to transmit the packet is       |
|            | available, which has included the delay the UE gets    |
|            | resources granted (from sending SR/RACH to get the     |
|            | first grant). The measurement is done separately per   |
|            | DRB.                                                   |

NOTE: UE measures UL PDCP queueing delay at DRB level. It is up to gNB
to convert DRB level delay to QoS level delay with the assumption that
all QoS flows mapped to the same DRB get the same QoS treatment, and it
is up to gNB to calculate QoS level delay if multiple DRBs mapped with
the same QoS.
