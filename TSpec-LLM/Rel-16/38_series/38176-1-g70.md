 Foreword
========

This clause is mandatory; do not alter the text in any way other than to
choose between \"Specification\" and \"Report\".

This Technical Specification has been produced by the 3rd Generation
Partnership Project (3GPP).

The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work
within the TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the
TSG modify the contents of the present document, it will be re-released
by the TSG with an identifying change of release date and an increase in
version number as follows:

Version x.y.z

where:

x the first digit:

1 presented to TSG for information;

2 presented to TSG for approval;

3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.

y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e.
technical enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.

z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been
incorporated in the document.

In the present document, modal verbs have the following meanings:

**shall** indicates a mandatory requirement to do something

**shall not** indicates an interdiction (prohibition) to do something

The constructions \"shall\" and \"shall not\" are confined to the
context of normative provisions, and do not appear in Technical Reports.

The constructions \"must\" and \"must not\" are not used as substitutes
for \"shall\" and \"shall not\". Their use is avoided insofar as
possible, and they are not used in a normative context except in a
direct citation from an external, referenced, non-3GPP document, or so
as to maintain continuity of style when extending or modifying the
provisions of such a referenced document.

**should** indicates a recommendation to do something

**should not** indicates a recommendation not to do something

**may** indicates permission to do something

**need not** indicates permission not to do something

The construction \"may not\" is ambiguous and is not used in normative
elements. The unambiguous constructions \"might not\" or \"shall not\"
are used instead, depending upon the meaning intended.

**can** indicates that something is possible

**cannot** indicates that something is impossible

The constructions \"can\" and \"cannot\" are not substitutes for \"may\"
and \"need not\".

**will** indicates that something is certain or expected to happen as a
result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside
the scope of the present document

**will not** indicates that something is certain or expected not to
happen as a result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which
is outside the scope of the present document

**might** indicates a likelihood that something will happen as a result
of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document

**might not** indicates a likelihood that something will not happen as a
result of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside
the scope of the present document

In addition:

**is** (or any other verb in the indicative mood) indicates a statement
of fact

**is not** (or any other negative verb in the indicative mood) indicates
a statement of fact

The constructions \"is\" and \"is not\" do not indicate requirements.

 1 Scope
=======

The present document establishes the minimum RF characteristics and
minimum performance requirements of NR Integrated access and backhaul
(IAB).

The present document specifies the Radio Frequency (RF) test methods and
conformance requirements for NR Integrated access and backhaul (IAB)
type 1-H. These have been derived from, and are consistent with the
conducted requirements for NR Integrated access and backhaul (IAB) type
1-H in NR Integrated access and backhaul specification defined in
TS 38.174 \[2\].

An *IAB type 1-H* has both conducted and radiated requirements so it
requires compliance to the applicable requirements of the present
document and TS 38.176-2 \[3\].

*IAB type 1-O* and IAB *type 2-O* have only radiated requirements so
they require compliance to TS 38.176-2 \[3\] only.

3 Definitions of terms, symbols and abbreviations
=================================================

3.1 Terms
---------

For the purposes of the present document, the terms given in 3GPP
TR 21.905 \[1\] and the following apply. A term defined in the present
document takes precedence over the definition of the same term, if any,
in 3GPP TR 21.905 \[1\].

**aggregated IAB channel bandwidth:** the RF bandwidth in which a IAB-DU
or IAB-MT transmits and receives multiple contiguously aggregated
carriers. The *aggregated IAB channel bandwidth* is measured in MHz

**active transmitter unit:** transmitter unit which is ON, and has the
ability to send modulated data streams that are parallel and distinct to
those sent from other transmitter units to one or more *IAB type 1-H*
*TAB connectors* at the *transceiver array boundary*

**basic limit:** emissions limit relating to the power supplied by a
single transmitter to a single antenna transmission line in ITU-R SM.329
\[5\] used for the formulation of unwanted emission requirements for FR1

**beam:** beam (of the antenna) is the main lobe of the radiation

4 General conducted test conditions and declarations
====================================================

4.1 Measurement uncertainties and test requirements
---------------------------------------------------

### 4.1.1 General

The requirements of this clause apply to all applicable tests in part 1
of the present document, i.e. to all conducted tests defined for FR1.
The frequency ranges FR1 and FR2 are defined in clause 5.1 of
TS 38.174 \[2\].

The minimum requirements are given in TS 38.174 \[2\] and the references
therein. Test Tolerances for the conducted test requirements explicitly
stated in the present document are given in Annex C of the present
document.

Test Tolerances are individually calculated for each test. The Test
Tolerances are used to relax the minimum requirements to create test
requirements.

When a test requirement differs from the corresponding minimum
requirement, then the Test Tolerance applied for the test is non-zero.
The Test Tolerance for the test and the explanation of how the minimum
requirement has been relaxed by the Test Tolerance are given in Annex C.

### 4.1.2 Acceptable uncertainty of Test System

#### 4.1.2.1 General

The maximum acceptable uncertainty of the Test System is specified below
for each test defined explicitly in the present specification, where
appropriate. The maximum acceptable uncertainty of the Test System for
test requirements included by reference is defined in the respective
referred test specification.

For *IAB type 1-H* when a requirement is applied per *TAB connector*
then the test uncertainty is applied to the measured value. When a
requirement is applied for a group of *TAB connectors* then the test
uncertainty is applied to sum of the measured power on each *TAB
connector* in the group.

The Test System shall enable the stimulus signals in the test case to be
adjusted to within the specified tolerance and the equipment under test
to be measured with an uncertainty not exceeding the specified values.
All tolerances and uncertainties are absolute values, and are valid for
a confidence level of 95 %, unless otherwise stated.

A confidence level of 95 % is the measurement uncertainty tolerance
interval for a specific measurement that contains 95 % of the
performance of a population of test equipment.

For RF tests, it should be noted that the uncertainties in clause 4.1.2
apply to the Test System operating into a nominal 50 ohm load and do not
include system effects due to mismatch between the DUT and the Test
System.

### 4.1.3 Interpretation of measurement results

The measurement results returned by the Test System are compared -
without any modification - against the test requirements as defined by
the Shared Risk principle.

The Shared Risk principle is defined in Recommendation
ITU-R M.1545 \[4\].

The actual measurement uncertainty of the Test System for the
measurement of each parameter shall be included in the test report.

The recorded value for the Test System uncertainty shall be, for each
measurement, equal to or lower than the appropriate figure in
clause 4.1.2 of the present document.

If the Test System for a test is known to have a measurement uncertainty
greater than that specified in clause 4.1.2, it is still permitted to
use this apparatus provided that an adjustment is made as follows.

Any additional uncertainty in the Test System over and above that
specified in clause 4.1.2 shall be used to tighten the test requirement,
making the test harder to pass. For some tests e.g. receiver tests, this
may require modification of stimulus signals. This procedure will ensure
that a Test System not compliant with clause 4.1.2 does not increase the
chance of passing a device under test where that device would otherwise
have failed the test if a Test System compliant with clause 4.1.2 had
been used.

4.2 Conducted requirement reference points
------------------------------------------

### 4.2.1 *IAB type 1-H*

*IAB type 1-H* requirements are defined for two points of reference,
signified by radiated requirements and conducted requirements.

Figure 4.2.1-1: Radiated and conducted reference points for *IAB type
1-H*

Radiated characteristics are defined over the air (OTA), where the
*operating band* specific radiated interface is referred to as the
*Radiated Interface Boundary* (RIB). Radiated requirements are also
referred to as OTA requirements. The (spatial) characteristics in which
the OTA requirements apply are detailed for each requirement.

NOTE: Radiated conformance requirements are captured in TS 38.176-2
\[3\] and are out of scope of the present document.

Conducted characteristics are defined at individual or groups of *TAB
connectors* at the *transceiver array boundary*, which is the conducted
interface between the transceiver unit array and the composite antenna.

The transceiver unit array is part of the composite transceiver
functionality generating modulated transmit signal structures and
performing receiver combining and demodulation.

The transceiver unit array contains an implementation specific number of
transmitter units and an implementation specific number of receiver
units. Transmitter units and receiver units may be combined into
transceiver units. The transmitter/receiver units have the ability to
transmit/receive parallel independent modulated symbol streams.

The composite antenna contains a radio distribution network (RDN) and an
antenna array. The RDN is a linear passive network which distributes the
RF power generated by the transceiver unit array to the antenna array,
and/or distributes the radio signals collected by the antenna array to
the transceiver unit array, in an implementation specific way.

How a conducted requirement is applied to the *transceiver array
boundary* is detailed in the respective requirement clause.

4.3 IAB classes
---------------

### 4.3.1 *IAB-DU class*

The requirements in the present document apply to Wide Area IAB-DU,
Medium Range IAB-DU and Local Area IAB-DU unless otherwise stated. For
*IAB type* 1-H, IAB-DU classes are defined as indicated below:

\- Wide Area IAB-DU are characterised by requirements derived from Macro
Cell scenarios with a BS to UE minimum coupling loss equal to 70 dB.

\- Medium Range IAB-DU are characterised by requirements derived from
Micro Cell scenarios with a BS to UE minimum coupling loss equals to 53
dB.

\- Local Area IAB-DU are characterised by requirements derived from Pico
Cell scenarios with a BS to UE minimum coupling loss equal to 45 dB.

### 4.3.2 *IAB-MT class*

*The requirements in the present document apply to Wide Area IAB-MT and
Local Area IAB-MT classes unless otherwise stated.*

*For IAB type 1-H, IAB-MT classes are defined as indicated below:*

\- Wide Area IAB-MT are characterised by requirements derived from Macro
Cell and/or Micro Cell scenarios.

\- Local Area IAB-MT are characterised by requirements derived from Pico
Cell and /or Micro Cell scenarios.

4.4 Regional requirements
-------------------------

Some requirements in the present document may only apply in certain
regions either as optional requirements, or as mandatory requirements
set by local and regional regulation. It is normally not stated in the
3GPP specifications under what exact circumstances the regional
requirements apply, since this is defined by local or regional
regulation.

Table 4.4-1 lists all requirements in the present specification that may
be applied differently in different regions.

For the tests in clause 7 of the present document, the requirement
applies at each receive *TAB connector*.

Conducted receive requirements are tested at the *TAB connector*, with
the remaining receiver units(s) disabled or their *TAB connector*(s)
being terminated.

#### 4.5.1.3 Power supply options

If the *IAB type 1-H* is supplied with a number of different power
supply configurations, it may not be necessary to test RF parameters for
each of the power supply options, provided that it can be demonstrated
that the range of conditions over which the equipment is tested is at
least as great as the range of conditions due to any of the power supply
configurations.

### 4.5.2 IAB with integrated Iuant BS modem

Unless otherwise stated, for the tests in the present document, the
integrated Iuant BS modem shall be switched OFF. Spurious emissions
according to clauses 6.6.5 and 7.6 shall be measured only for
frequencies above 20 MHz with the integrated Iuant BS modem switched ON.

4.6 Manufacturer declarations
-----------------------------

The following *IAB type 1-H* declarations listed in table 4.6-1, when
applicable to the IAB-DU or IAB-MT under test, are required to be
provided by the manufacturer for the conducted requirements testing of
the *IAB type 1-H*. Declarations may be provided independently for
IAB-MT and IAB-DU.

For the *IAB type 1-H* declarations required for the radiated
requirements testing, refer to TS 38.176-2 \[3\].

4.7 Test configurations
-----------------------

### 4.7.1 General

The test configurations shall be constructed using the methods defined
below, subject to the parameters declared by the manufacturer for the
supported RF configurations as listed in clause 4.6. The test
configurations to use for conformance testing are defined for each
supported RF configuration in clauses 4.8.3 and 4.8.4.

The applicable test models for generation of the carrier transmit test
signal are defined in clause 4.9.

NOTE: If required, carriers are shifted to align with the channel
raster.

### 4.7.2 Test signal used to build Test Configurations

The signal\'s channel bandwidth and subcarrier spacing used to build IAB
Test Configurations shall be selected according to table 4.7.2-1.

  NOTE 1: If this channel bandwidth is not supported, the narrowest supported channel bandwidth shall be used.                                                                                       

### 4.7.3 IABTC1: Contiguous spectrum operation

#### 4.7.3.1 General

The purpose of test configuration IABTC1 is to test all IAB requirements
excluding CA occupied bandwidth.

For IABTC1 used in receiver tests only the two outermost UL carriers and
two outermost DL carriers within each supported operating band need to
be generated by the test equipment;

#### 4.7.3.2 IABTC1 generation

IABTC1 shall be constructed on a per band basis using the following
method:

\- Declared maximum IAB RF Bandwidth supported for contiguous spectrum
operation (D.11) shall be used;

\- Select the IAB carrier to be tested according to 4.7.2 and place it
adjacent to the lower IAB RF Bandwidth edge. Place same signals adjacent
to the upper IAB RF Bandwidth edge.

\- For transmitter tests, select as many IAB carriers (according to
4.7.2) that the IAB supports within an *operating band* and fit in the
rest of the declared maximum IAB RF Bandwidth (D.11). Place the carriers
adjacent to each other starting from the upper IAB RF Bandwidth edge.
The nominal channel spacing defined in TS 38.174 \[2\], clause 5.4.1
shall apply.

The test configuration should be constructed sequentially on a per band
basis for all component carriers of the inter-band CA bands declared to
be supported by the IAB and are transmitted using the same *TAB
connector*. All configured component carriers are transmitted
simultaneously in the tests where the transmitter should be ON.

#### 4.7.3.3 IABTC1 power allocation

Set the power spectral density of each carrier to the same level so that
the sum of the carrier powers equals the rated total output power
(P~rated,t,AC~, or P~rated,t,TABC~, D.22) for IAB according to the
manufacturer\'s declaration in clause 4.6.

### 4.7.4 IABTC2: Contiguous CA occupied bandwidth

#### 4.7.4.1 General

IABTC2 in this clause is used to test CA occupied bandwidth.

#### 4.7.4.2 IABTC2 generation

The CA specific test configuration should be constructed on a per band
basis using the following method:

\- All component carrier combinations supported by the IAB, which have
different sum of channel bandwidth of **component carrier**, shall be
tested. For all **component carrier** combinations which have the same
sum of channel bandwidth of **component carriers**, only one of the
component carrier combinations shall be tested.

\- Of all **component carrier** combinations which have same sum of
channel bandwidth of **component carrier**, select those with the
narrowest carrier with the smallest supported subcarrier spacing at the
lower IAB RF Bandwidth edge.

\- Of the combinations selected in the previous step, select one with
the narrowest carrier with the smallest supported subcarrier spacing at
the upper IAB RF Bandwidth edge.

\- If there are multiple combinations fulfilling previous steps, select
the one with the smallest number of **component carrier**.

\- If there are multiple combinations fulfilling previous steps, select
the one with the widest carrier with the smallest supported subcarrier
spacing being adjacent to the lowest carrier.

\- If there are multiple combinations fulfilling previous steps, select
the one with the widest carrier with the smallest supported subcarrier
spacing being adjacent to the highest carrier.

\- If there are multiple combinations fulfilling previous steps, select
the one with the widest carrier with the smallest supported subcarrier
spacing being adjacent to the carrier which has been selected in the
previous step.

\- If there are multiple combinations fulfilling previous steps, repeat
the previous step until there is only one combination left.

\- The nominal channel spacing defined in TS 38.174 \[2\], clause 5.4.1
shall apply.

#### 4.7.4.3 IABTC2 power allocation

Set the power spectral density of each carrier to be the same level so
that the sum of the carrier powers equals the rated total output power
(P~rated,t,AC~, or P~rated,t,TABC~, D.22) for IAB according to the
manufacturer\'s declaration in clause 4.6.

### 4.7.5 IABTC3: Non-contiguous spectrum operation

#### 4.7.5.1 General

The purpose of IABTC3 is to test all IAB requirements excluding CA
occupied bandwidth.

For IABTC3 used in receiver tests, outermost DL and UL carriers for each
sub-block need to be generated by the test equipment; other supported
carriers are optional to be generated.

#### 4.7.5.2 IABTC3 generation

IABTC3 is constructed on a per band basis using the following method:

\- The IAB RF Bandwidth shall be the maximum IAB RF Bandwidth supported
for non-contiguous spectrum operation (D.11). The IAB RF Bandwidth
consists of one sub-block gap and two sub-blocks located at the edges of
the declared maximum supported IAB RF Bandwidth (D.11).

\- Select the IAB carrier to be tested according to clause 4.7.2. Place
it adjacent to the upper IAB RF Bandwidth edge and another carrier (as
described in clause 4.7.2) adjacent to the lower IAB RF Bandwidth edge.

\- For single-band operation receiver tests, if the remaining gap is at
least 15 MHz (or 60 MHz if channel bandwidth of the carrier to be tested
is 20 MHz) plus two times the channel BW used in the previous step and
the IAB supports at least 4 carriers, place a carrier of this BW
adjacent to each already placed carrier for each sub-block. The nominal
channel spacing defined in TS 38.174 \[2\], clause 5.4.1 shall apply.

\- The sub-block edges adjacent to the sub-block gap shall be determined
using the specified F~offset\_high~ and F~offset\_low~ for the carriers
adjacent to the sub-block gap.

#### 4.7.5.3 IABTC3 power allocation

Set the power of each carrier to the same level so that the sum of the
carrier powers equals the rated total output power (P~rated,t,AC~, or
P~rated,t,TABC~, D.22) for IAB according to the manufacturer\'s
declaration in clause 4.6.

### 4.7.6 IABTC4: Multi-band test configuration for full carrier allocation

#### 4.7.6.1 General

The purpose of IABTC4 is to test multi-band operation aspects
considering maximum supported number of carriers.

#### 4.7.6.2 IABTC4 generation

IABTC4 is based on re-using the previously specified test configurations
(IABTC1, IABTC2 and IABTC3) applicable per band involved in multi-band
operation. It is constructed using the following method:

\- The IAB RF Bandwidth of each supported operating band shall be the
declared maximum IAB RF Bandwidth in multi-band operation (D.12).

\- The number of carriers of each supported *operating band* shall be
the declared maximum number of supported carriers per operating band in
multi-band operation (D. 18). Carriers shall be selected according to
4.7.2 and shall first be placed at the outermost edges of the declared
maximum Radio Bandwidth. Additional carriers shall next be placed at the
IAB RF Bandwidths edges, if possible.

\- The allocated IAB RF Bandwidth of the outermost bands shall be
located at the outermost edges of the declared maximum Radio Bandwidth.

\- Each concerned band shall be considered as an independent band and
the carrier placement in each band shall be according to IABTC1, where
the declared parameters for multi-band operation shall apply. The mirror
image of the single-band test configuration shall be used in each
alternate band(s) and in the highest band being.

\- If only three carriers are supported, two carriers shall be placed in
one band according to the relevant test configuration while the
remaining carrier shall be placed at the edge of the maximum *Radio
Bandwidth* in the other band.

\- If the sum of the maximum IAB RF Bandwidths of each supported
*operating bands* is larger than the declared *Total RF Bandwidth*
BW~tot~ (D.13) of transmitter and receiver for the declared band
combinations of the IAB, repeat the steps above for test configurations
where the IAB RF Bandwidth of one of the operating band shall be reduced
so that the *Total RF Bandwidth* of transmitter and receiver is not
exceeded and vice versa.

\- If the sum of the maximum number of supported carriers per operating
band in multi-band operation (D.18) is larger than the declared total
maximum number of supported carriers in multi-band operation (D. 19),
repeat the steps above for test configurations where in each test
configuration the number of carriers of one of the operating band shall
be reduced so that the total number of supported carriers is not
exceeded and vice versa.

#### 4.7.6.3 IABTC4 power allocation

Unless otherwise stated, set the power of each carrier in all supported
*operating bands* to the same power so that the sum of the carrier
powers equals the rated total output power (P~rated,t,AC~ or
P~rated,t,TABC~, D.22) according to the manufacturer\'s declaration.

If the allocated power of a supported *operating band(s)* exceeds the
declared rated total output power of the *operating band(s)* in
multi-band operation, the exceeded part shall, if possible, be
reallocated into the other band(s). If the power allocated for a carrier
exceeds the rated output power declared for that carrier, the exceeded
power shall, if possible, be reallocated into the other carriers.

### 4.7.7 IABTC5: Multi-band test configuration with high PSD per carrier

#### 4.7.7.1 General

The purpose of IABTC5 is to test multi-band operation aspects
considering higher PSD cases with reduced number of carriers and
non-contiguous operation (if supported) in multi-band mode.

#### 4.7.7.2 IABTC5 generation

IABTC5 is based on re-using the existing test configuration applicable
per band involved in multi-band operation. It is constructed using the
following method:

\- The IAB RF Bandwidth of each supported *operating band* shall be the
declared maximum IAB RF Bandwidth in multi-band operation (D.12).

\- The allocated IAB RF Bandwidth of the outermost bands shall be
located at the outermost edges of the declared Maximum Radio Bandwidth.

\- The maximum number of carriers is limited to two per band. Carriers
shall be selected according to 4.7.2 and shall first be placed at the
outermost edges of the declared Maximum Radio Bandwidth for outermost
bands and at the IAB RF Bandwidths edges for middle band(s) if any.
Additional carriers shall next be placed at the IAB RF Bandwidths edges,
if possible.

\- Each concerned band shall be considered as an independent band and
the carrier placement in each band shall be according to IABTC3, where
the declared parameters for multi-band operation shall apply. Narrowest
supported NR channel bandwidth and smallest subcarrier spacing shall be
used in the test configuration.

\- If only one carrier can be placed for the concerned band(s), the
carrier(s) shall be placed at the outermost edges of the declared
maximum radio bandwidth for outermost band(s) and at one of the
outermost edges of the supported frequency range within the IAB RF
Bandwidths for middle band(s) if any.

\- If the sum of the maximum IAB RF Bandwidth of each supported
operating bands is larger than the declared *Total RF Bandwidth* BW~tot~
(D.13) of transmitter and receiver for the declared band combinations of
the IAB, repeat the steps above for test configurations where the IAB RF
Bandwidth of one of the operating band shall be reduced so that the
*Total RF Bandwidth* BW~tot~ of transmitter and receiver is not exceeded
and vice versa.

#### 4.7.7.3 IABTC5 power allocation

Unless otherwise stated, set the power of each carrier in all supported
*operating bands* to the same power so that the sum of the carrier
powers equals the total rated output power (P~rated,t,AC~ or
P~rated,t,TABC~, D.22) according to the manufacturer\'s declaration.

If the allocated power of a supported *operating band(s)* exceeds the
declared rated total output power of the *operating band(s)* in
multi-band operation, the exceeded part shall, if possible, be
reallocated into the other band(s). If the power allocated for a carrier
exceeds the rated output power declared for that carrier, the exceeded
power shall, if possible, be reallocated into the other carriers.

### 4.8.3 Applicability of test configurations for single-band operation

The applicable test configurations are specified in the tables below for
each the supported RF configuration, which shall be declared according
to clause 4.6. The generation and power allocation for each test
configuration is defined in clause 4.7. This clause contains the test
configurations for an IAB node capable of single carrier, multi-carrier
and/or CA operation in both contiguous and non-contiguous spectrum in
single band.

For an IAB node declared to be capable of single carrier operation only
(D.16), a single carrier (SC) shall be used for testing.

For an IAB node declared to support multi-carrier and/or CA operation in
contiguous spectrum within a single band (D.15-D.16), the test
configurations in the second column of table 4.8.3-1 shall be used for
testing.

For an IAB node declared to support multi-carrier and/or CA operation in
contiguous and non-contiguous spectrum within a single band (D.15-D.16)
and where the parameters in the manufacture\'s declaration according to
clause 4.6 are identical for contiguous (C) and non-contiguous (NC)
spectrum operation (D.9), the test configurations in the third column of
table 4.8.3-1 shall be used for testing.

For an IAB node declared to support multi-carrier and/or CA in operation
contiguous and non-contiguous spectrum within a single band (D.15-D.16)
and where the parameters in the manufacture\'s declaration according to
clause 4.6 are not identical for contiguous (C) and non-contiguous (NC)
spectrum operation (D.9), the test configurations in the fourth column
of table 4.8.3-1 shall be used for testing.

Unless otherwise stated, single carrier configuration (SC) tests shall
be performed using signal with narrowest supported channel bandwidth and
the smallest supported sub-carrier spacing.

### 4.8.4 Applicability of test configurations for *multi-band* operation

For an IAB node declared to be capable of multi-band operation, the test
configuration in table 4.8.4-1 and/or table 4.8.3-1 shall be used for
testing. In the case where multiple bands are mapped on common
*multi-band connector*, the test configuration in the second column of

4.9 RF channels and test models
-------------------------------

### 4.9.1 RF channels

For the single carrier testing many tests in this TS are performed with
appropriate frequencies in the bottom, middle and top channels of the
supported frequency range of the IAB. These are denoted as RF channels B
(bottom), M (middle) and T (top).

Unless otherwise stated, the test shall be performed with a single
carrier at each of the RF channels B, M and T.

Many tests in this TS are performed with the maximum IAB RF Bandwidth
located at the bottom, middle and top of the supported frequency range
in the operating band. These are denoted as B~RFBW~ (bottom), M~RFBW~
(middle) and T~RFBW~ (top).

Unless otherwise stated, the test shall be performed at B~RFBW~, M~RFBW~
and T~RFBW~ defined as following:

\- B~RFBW~: maximum IAB RF Bandwidth located at the bottom of the
supported frequency range in the operating band.

\- M~RFBW~: maximum IAB RF Bandwidth located in the middle of the
supported frequency range in the operating band.

\- T~RFBW~: maximum IAB RF Bandwidth located at the top of the supported
frequency range in the operating band.

Occupied bandwidth test in this TS is performed with the *aggregated IAB
channel bandwidth* and sub-block bandwidths located at the bottom,
middle and top of the supported frequency range in the operating band.
These are denoted as B~BW\ Channel\ CA~(bottom), M~BW\ Channel\ CA~
(middle) and T~BW\ Channel\ CA~ (top) for contiguous spectrum operation.

Unless otherwise stated, the test for contiguous spectrum operation
shall be performed at B~BW\ Channel\ CA~, M~BW\ Channel\ CA~ and
T~BW\ Channel\ CA~ defined as following:

\- B~BW\ Channel\ CA~: *aggregated IAB channel bandwidth* located at the
bottom of the supported frequency range in each operating band;

\- M~BW\ Channel\ CA~: *aggregated IAB channel bandwidth* located close
in the middle of the supported frequency range in each operating band;

\- T~BW\ Channel\ CA~: *aggregated IAB channel bandwidth* located at the
top of the supported frequency range in each operating band.

For IAB capable of multi-band operation, unless otherwise stated, the
test shall be performed at B~RFBW~\_T\'~RFBW~ and B\'~RFBW~\_T~RFBW~
defined as following:

\- B~RFBW~\_T\'~RFBW~: the *IAB RF Bandwidths* located at the bottom of
the supported frequency range in the lowest operating band and at the
highest possible simultaneous frequency position, within the Maximum
Radio Bandwidth, in the highest operating band.

\- B\'~RFBW~\_T~RFBW:~ the *IAB RF Bandwidths* located at the top of the
supported frequency range in the highest operating band and at the
lowest possible simultaneous frequency position, within the Maximum
Radio Bandwidth, in the lowest operating band.

NOTE: B~RFBW~\_T\'~RFBW~ = B\'~RFBW~\_T~RFBW~ = B~RFBW~\_T~RFBW~ when
the declared Maximum Radio Bandwidth spans all operating bands.
B~RFBW~\_T~RFBW~ means the *IAB RF Bandwidths* are located at the bottom
of the supported frequency range in the lower operating band and at the
top of the supported frequency range in the upper operating band.

When a test is performed by a test laboratory, the position of B, M and
T for single carrier, B~RFBW~, M~RFBW~ and T~RFBW~ for single band
operation, B~BW\ Channel\ CA~, M~BW\ Channel\ CA~ and T~BW\ Channel\ CA~
for contiguous spectrum operation in each supported operating band, the
position of B~RFBW~\_T\'~RFBW~ and B\'~RFBW~\_T~RFBW~ in the supported
operating band combinations shall be specified by the laboratory. The
laboratory may consult with operators, the manufacturer or other bodies.

4.10 Requirements for contiguous and non-contiguous spectrum
------------------------------------------------------------

A spectrum allocation where an IAB-DU or IAB-MT operates can either be
contiguous or non-contiguous. Unless otherwise stated, the requirements
in the present specification apply for IAB-DU and IAB-MT configured for
both *contiguous spectrum* operation and *non-contiguous spectrum*
operation.

For IAB-DU or IAB-MT operation in *non-contiguous spectrum*, some
requirements apply both at the *IAB RF Bandwidth edges* and inside the
*sub-block gaps*. For each such requirement, it is stated how the limits
apply relative to the *IAB RF Bandwidth edges* and the *sub-block* edges
respectively.

4.11 Requirements for IAB capable of multi-band operation
---------------------------------------------------------

For *multi-band connector* the conducted test requirements in clause 6
and 7 apply separately to each supported *operating band* unless
otherwise stated. For some requirements, it is explicitly stated that
specific additions or exclusions to the requirement apply at *multi-band
connector(s)* as detailed in the requirement clause. For *IAB-DU or
IAB-MT* capable of multi-band operation, various structures in terms of
combinations of different transmitter and receiver implementations
(multi-band or single band) with mapping of transceivers to one or more
*TAB connectors* for *IAB type 1-H* in different ways are possible. For
*multi-band connector(s)* the exclusions or provisions for multi-band
apply. For *single-band connector(s)*, the following applies:

\- Single-band transmitter spurious emissions, *operating band* unwanted
emissions, ACLR, transmitter intermodulation and receiver spurious
emissions requirements apply to this *connector* that is mapped to
single-band.

\- If the IAB-DU or IAB-MT is configured for single-band operation,
single-band requirements shall apply to this *connector* configured for
single-band operation and no exclusions or provisions for multi-band
capable *IAB-DU* or *IAB-MT* are applicable. Single-band requirements
are tested separately at the *connector* configured for single-band
operation, with all other *TAB connectors* terminated.

An *IAB type 1-H* may be capable of supporting operation in multiple
*operating bands* with one of the following implementations of *TAB
connectors* in the *transceiver array boundary*:

\- All *TAB connectors* are *single-band connectors*.

\- Different sets of *single-band connectors* support different
*operating bands*, but each *TAB connector* supports only operation in
one single *operating band*.

\- Sets of *single-band connectors* support operation in multiple
*operating bands* with some *single-band connectors* supporting more
than one *operating band*.

\- All *TAB connectors* are multi-band *connectors*.

\- A combination of single-band sets and multi-band sets of *TAB
connectors* provides support of the type *IAB type 1-H* capability of
operation in multiple *operating bands*.

Unless otherwise stated all requirements specified for an *operating
band* apply only to the set of *TAB connectors* supporting that
*operating band*.

In the case of an *operating band* being supported only by *single-band
connectors* in a *TAB connector TX min cell group* or a *TAB connector
RX min cell group*, *single-band requirements* apply to that set of *TAB
connectors*.

In the case of an *operating band* being supported only by *multi-band
connector*s supporting the same *operating band* combination in a *TAB
connector TX min cell group* or a *TAB connector RX min cell group*,
*multi-band requirements* apply to that set of *TAB connectors*.

For multi-band connectors supporting the bands for TDD, the RF
requirements in the present specification assume no simultaneous uplink
and downlink occur between the bands.

NOTE 1: The case of an operating band being supported by both multi-band
connectors and single-band connectors in a TAB connector TX min cell
group or a TAB connector RX min cell group is not covered by the present
release of the present document.

NOTE 2: The case of an operating band being supported by multi-band
connectors which are not all supporting the same operating band
combination in a TAB connector TX min cell group or a TAB connector RX
min cell group is not covered by the present release of the present
document.

4.12 Format and interpretation of tests
---------------------------------------

Each test has a standard format:

**X Title**

All tests are applicable to all equipment within the scope of the
present document, unless otherwise stated.

**X.1 Definition and applicability**

This clause gives the general definition of the parameter under
consideration and specifies whether the test is applicable to all
equipment or only to a certain subset. Required manufacturer
declarations may be included here.

**X.2 Minimum requirement**

This clause contains the reference to the clause to the 3GPP reference
(or core) specification which defines the minimum requirement.

**X.3 Test purpose**

This clause defines the purpose of the test.

**X.4 Method of test**

**X.4.1 General**

In some cases there are alternative test procedures or initial
conditions. In such cases, guidance for which initial conditions and
test procedures can be applied are stated here. In the case only one
test procedure is applicable, that is stated here.

**X.4.2y First test method**

**X.4.2y.1 Initial conditions**

This clause defines the initial conditions for each test, including the
test environment, the RF channels to be tested and the basic measurement
set-up.

**X.4.2y.2 Procedure**

This clause describes the steps necessary to perform the test and
provides further details of the test definition like domain (e.g.
frequency-span), range, weighting (e.g. bandwidth), and algorithms
(e.g. averaging). The procedure may comprise data processing of the
measurement result before comparison with the test requirement (e.g.
average result from several measurement positions).

**X.4.3y Alternative test method (if any)**

If there are alternative test methods, each is described with its
initial conditions and procedures.

**X.5 Test requirement**

This clause defines the pass/fail criteria for the equipment under test,
see clause 4.1.3 (Interpretation of measurement results). Test
requirements for every minimum requirement referred in clause X.2 are
listed here. Cases where minimum requirements do not apply need not be
mentioned.

4.13 Test efficiency optimization
---------------------------------

When manufacture declares the same RF implementation for IAB-MT and
IAB-DU (D.IAB-1) and the declarations in table 4.13-1 are the same for
IAB-DU and IAB-MT, it is sufficient to test only IAB-MT or IAB-DU with
the test requirement applicability according to Table 4.13-2 for Tx
requirements and Table 4.13-3 for Rx requirements.

For *IAB type 1-H* it is required that the DUT selection between
requirements follows following rules:

\- Out of maximum output transmit power, modulation quality and ACLR,
operating band unwanted emissions and transmitter general spurious
emissions, IAB-DU and IAB-MT are required to be the DUT at least once,

\- Out of reference sensitivity, receiver spurious emissions, receiver
intermodulation, IAB-DU and IAB-MT are required to be the DUT at least
once.

In some cases, the test requirements are the same but the MU for the
IAB-MT may be larger than for the IAB-DU. In cases where the test
efficiency optimization is applicable the lower MU value should be used.

5 Operating bands and channel arrangement
=========================================

For the IAB operation in NR operating bands specification, their channel
bandwidth configurations, channel spacing and raster, as well as
synchronization raster specification, refer to TS 38.174 \[2\], clause 5
and its relevant clauses.

For conducted testing purposes in the present document, only FR1
operating bands are considered.

6 Conducted transmitter characteristics (IAB-DU and IAB-MT)
===========================================================

6.1 General
-----------

General test conditions for conducted transmitter tests are given in
clause 4, including interpretation of measurement results and
configurations for testing. IAB configurations for the tests are defined
in clause 4.5.

If a number of *single-band connectors, or multi-band connectors* have
been declared equivalent (D.32), only a representative one is necessary
to be tested to demonstrate conformance.

In clause 6.6.3.5.3, if representative *TAB connectors* are used then
per connector criteria (i.e. option 2) shall be applied.

*For IAB-DU and IAB-MT* *the manufacturer shall declare the minimum
number of supported geographical cells (i.e. geographical areas). The
declaration is done separately for IAB-DU and IAB-MT. The minimum number
of supported geographical cells (N~cells,~ D.24) relates to the setting
with the minimum amount of cell splitting supported with transmission on
all TAB connectors supporting the operating band.*

*For IAB-DU and IAB-MT manufacturer shall also declare TAB connector TX
min cell groups* (D.34)*. The declaration is done separately for IAB-DU
and IAB-MT.* Every *TAB connector* of the *IAB type 1-H* supporting
transmission in an *operating band* shall map to one *TAB connector* *TX
min cell group* supporting the same *operating band*, where *mapping of
TAB connectors to cells/beams is implementation dependent.*

*The number of active transmitter units that are considered when
calculating the conducted TX emissions limits (N~TXU,counted~) for
IAB-DU and IAB-MT is calculated as follows:*

N~TXU,counted~ = *min(N~TXU,active~, 8×N~cells~)*

N~TXU,countedpercell~ is used for scaling of *basic limits* and is
derived as N~TXU,countedpercell~ = *N~TXU,counted~ / N~cells~*

NOTE: N~TXU,active~ depends on the actual number of *active transmitter
unit*s and is independent to the declaration of N~cells~.

#### 6.4.2.4 Method of test

##### 6.4.2.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment:

\- normal; see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier:

\- M; see clause 4.9.1.

RF bandwidth positions to be tested for multi-carrier and/or CA:

\- MRFBW in single-band operation, see clause 4.9.1;

\- BRFBW\_T\'RFBW and B\'RFBW\_TRFBW in multi-band operation, see
clause 4.9.1.

##### 6.4.2.4.2 Procedure

The minimum requirement is applied to all *TAB connectors*, they may be
tested one at a time or multiple *TAB connectors* may be tested in
parallel as shown in annex D.1.1 for *IAB type 1-H*. Whichever method is
used the procedure is repeated until all *TAB connectors* necessary to
demonstrate conformance have been tested.

1\) Connect *TAB connector* to measurement equipment as shown in annex
D.1.1 for *IAB type 1-H*. All *TAB connectors* not under test shall be
terminated.

As a general rule, the resolution bandwidth of the measuring equipment
should be equal to the measurement bandwidth. However, to improve
measurement accuracy, sensitivity, efficiency and avoiding e.g. carrier
leakage, the resolution bandwidth may be smaller than the measurement
bandwidth. When the resolution bandwidth is smaller than the measurement
bandwidth, the result should be integrated over the measurement
bandwidth in order to obtain the equivalent noise bandwidth of the
measurement bandwidth.

2\) For single carrier set the *TAB connector* under test to transmit
according to the applicable test configuration in clause 4.8 using the
corresponding test models or set of physical channels in clause 4.9.2 at
manufacturers declared *rated carrier output power* per *TAB connector*
(P~rated,c,TABC~, D.21).

For a connector under test declared to be capable of multi-carrier
and/or CA operation (D.15-D.16) set the connector under test to transmit
on all carriers configured using the applicable test configuration and
corresponding power setting specified in clauses 4.7 and 4.8 using the
corresponding test models or set of physical channels in clause 4.9.2.

3\) Measure the mean power spectral density over 70/N μs filtered with a
square filter of bandwidth equal to the RF bandwidth of the *TAB
connector* centred on the central frequency of the RF bandwidth. 70/N μs
average window centre is set from 35/N μs after end of one transmitter
ON period + 10 μs to 35/N μs before start of next transmitter ON period
-- 10 μs. N = SCS/15, where SCS is Sub Carrier Spacing in kHz.

4\) For a *TAB connector* supporting contiguous CA, measure the mean
power spectral density over 70/N μs filtered with a square filter of
bandwidth equal to the *aggregated IAB channel bandwidth*
BW~Channel\_CA~ centred on (F~edge\_high~+F~edge\_low~)/2. 70/N μs
average window centre is set from 35/N μs after end of one transmitter
ON period + 10 μs to 35/N μs before start of next transmitter ON period
-- 10 μs. N = SCS/15, where SCS is the smallest supported Sub Carrier
Spacing in kHz in the *aggregated IAB channel bandwidth*.

In addition, for *multi-band connector(s)*, the following steps shall
apply:

5\) For *multi-band connectors* and single band tests, repeat the steps
above per involved band where single band test configurations and test
models shall apply with no carrier activated in the other band.

#### 6.4.2.5 Test requirements

The measured mean power spectral density according to clause 6.4.2.4.2
shall be less than -83 dBm/MHz for carrier frequency f ≤ 3.0 GHz.

The measured mean power spectral density according to clause 6.4.2.4.2
shall be less than -82.5 dBm/MHz for carrier frequency 3.0 GHz \< f ≤
6.0 GHz.

For *multi-band connector*, the requirement is only applicable during
the transmitter OFF period in all supported operating bands.

Modulation quality is defined by the difference between the measured
carrier signal and an ideal signal. Modulation quality can e.g. be
expressed as Error Vector Magnitude (EVM). The Error Vector Magnitude is
a measure of the difference between the ideal symbols and the measured
symbols after the equalization. This difference is called the error
vector.

### 6.5.4 Time alignment error

#### 6.5.4.1 Definition and applicability

For IAB-DU, this requirement applies to frame timing in MIMO
transmission, carrier aggregation and their combinations. There's no
time alignment error requirement for IAB-MT.

Frames of the NR signals present at the IAB-DU transmitter *TAB
connectors* are not perfectly aligned in time and may experience certain
timing differences in relation to each other.

For *IAB type 1-H*, the TAE is defined as the largest timing difference
between any two signals belonging to *TAB connectors* belonging to
different transmitter groups at the *transceiver array boundary*, where
transmitter groups are associated with the *TAB connectors* in the
transceiver unit array corresponding to MIMO transmission, *carrier
aggregation* for a specific set of signals/transmitter
configuration/transmission mode.

#### 6.5.4.2 Minimum requirement

The minimum requirements for *IAB-DU* are in TS 38.174 \[2\],
clause 6.5.3.1.

#### 6.5.4.3 Test purpose

To verify that the time alignment error is within the limit specified by
the minimum requirement.

#### 6.5.4.4 Method of test

##### 6.5.4.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: Normal, see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier: M; see clause 4.9.1.

RF bandwidth positions to be tested for multi-carrier and/or CA:

\- M~RFBW~ in single-band operation, see clause 4.9.1.

\- B~RFBW~\_T\'~RFBW~ and B\'~RFBW~\_T~RFBW~ in multi-band operation,
see clause 4.9.1.

##### 6.5.4.4.2 Procedure

For *IAB type 1-H* *TAB connectors* to be tested are identified from the
declared sets of *TAB connector beam forming groups* in the TAE groups
declaration (D.31).

Compliance is to be demonstrated between all pairs of *single-band
connectors and/or multi-band connectors*, however it is not required to
exhaustively measure TAE between every combination of pairs of
representative connectors. Compliance can be demonstrated by comparison
of a reduced set of representative measurement results.

1\) Conducted measurement setup:

\- For *IAB type 1-H*: Connect two representative *TAB connectors* one
from separate TAE group (D.31) to the measurement equipment according to
annex D.1.4. Terminate any unused *TAB connector(s).*

2\) Set the connectors under test to transmit IAB-DU-FR1-TM1.1 or any DL
signal using MIMO transmission or carrier aggregation.

NOTE: For MIMO transmission, different ports may be configured in
IAB-DU-FR1-TM1.1 (using *PDSCH DMRS ports 1000 and 1001*).

3\) For a connectors declared to be capable of single carrier operation
only (D.16), set the representative connectors under test to transmit
according to the applicable test configuration in clause 4.8 using the
corresponding test models in clause 4.9.2 at *rated carrier output
power* (P~rated,c,AC~, or P~rated,c,TABC~, D.21).

If the connector under test supports intra band contiguous or
non-contiguous CA, set the representative connectors to transmit using
the applicable test configuration and corresponding power setting
specified in clauses 4.7 and 4.8.

If the IAB-DU supports inter band CA, set the representative connectors
to transmit, for each band, a single carrier or all carriers, using the
applicable test configuration and corresponding power setting specified
in clauses 4.7 and 4.8.

For a connector declared to be capable of multi-carrier operation
(D.15), set the IAB-DU to transmit according to the applicable test
signal configuration and corresponding power setting specified in
clauses 4.7 and 4.8 using the corresponding test model in clause 4.9.2
on all carriers configured.

4\) Measure the time alignment error between the different PDSCH
demodulation reference signals on different antenna ports belonging to
different connectors on the carrier(s) from the representative
connectors under test.

5\) Repeat step 1 - 4 for any other configuration of connectors, which
could be required to demonstrate compliance.

In addition, for *multi-band connectors*, the following steps shall
apply:

6\) For a *multi-band connectors* and single band tests, repeat the
steps above per involved *operating band* where single band test
configurations and test models shall apply with no carrier activated in
the other *operating band*.

#### 6.5.4.5 Test requirement

For MIMO transmission, at each carrier frequency, TAE shall not exceed
90 ns.

For intra-band contiguous CA, with or without MIMO, TAE shall not exceed
285 ns.

For intra-band non-contiguous CA, with or without MIMO, TAE shall not
exceed 3.025 µs.

For inter-band CA, with or without MIMO, TAE shall not exceed 3.025 µs.

6.6 Unwanted emissions
----------------------

### 6.6.1 General

Unwanted emissions consist of out-of-band emissions and spurious
emissions according to ITU definitions in recommendation ITU-R SM.329
\[5\]. In ITU terminology, out of band emissions are unwanted emissions
immediately outside the *channel bandwidth* resulting from the
modulation process and non-linearity in the transmitter but excluding
spurious emissions. Spurious emissions are emissions which are caused by
unwanted transmitter effects such as harmonics emission, parasitic
emission, intermodulation products and frequency conversion products,
but exclude out of band emissions.

The out-of-band emissions requirement for the IAB-DU and IAB-MT
transmitter is specified both in terms of Adjacent Channel Leakage power
Ratio (ACLR) and *operating band* unwanted emissions (OBUE).

The maximum offset of the *operating band* unwanted emissions mask from
the *operating band* edge is Δf~OBUE~. The Operating band unwanted
emissions define all unwanted emissions in each supported downlink
*operating band* of IAB-DU and uplink *operating band* of IAB-MT, plus
the frequency ranges Δf~OBUE~ above and Δf~OBUE~ below each band.
Unwanted emissions outside of this frequency range are limited by a
spurious emissions requirement.

The values of Δf~OBUE~ are defined in tables 6.6.1-1 and 6.6.1-2 for the
NR *operating bands*.

Table 6.6.1-1: Maximum offset of OBUE outside the downlink *operating
band of IAB-DU*

  IAB-DU type      *Operating band* characteristics              Δf~OBUE~ (MHz)
  ---------------- --------------------------------------------- ----------------
  *IAB type 1-H*   F~DL,high~ -- F~DL,low~ \< 100 MHz            10
                   100 MHz ≤ F~DL,high~ -- F~DL,low~ ≤ 900 MHz   40

Table 6.6.1-2: Maximum offset of OBUE outside the uplink *operating band
of IAB-MT*

  IAB-MT type      *Operating band* characteristics              Δf~OBUE~ (MHz)
  ---------------- --------------------------------------------- ----------------
  *IAB type 1-H*   F~UL,high~ -- F~UL,low~ \< 100 MHz            10
                   100 MHz ≤ F~UL,high~ -- F~UL,low~ ≤ 900 MHz   40

For *IAB type 1-H* the unwanted emission requirements are applied per
the *TAB connector TX min cell groups* for all the supported
configurations. The *basic limits* and corresponding emissions scaling
are defined in each relevant clause.

There is in addition a requirement for occupied bandwidth.

### 6.6.2 Occupied bandwidth

#### 6.6.2.1 General

The occupied bandwidth is the width of a frequency band such that, below
the lower and above the upper frequency limits, the mean powers emitted
are each equal to a specified percentage β/2 of the total mean
transmitted power. See also Recommendation ITU-R SM.328 \[6\].

The value of β/2 shall be taken as 0.5%.

The occupied bandwidth requirement shall apply during the *transmitter
ON period* for a single transmitted carrier. The minimum requirement
below may be applied regionally. There may also be regional requirements
to declare the occupied bandwidth according to the definition in the
present clause.

For *IAB type 1-H* this requirement shall be applied at each *TAB
connector* supporting transmission in the *operating band.*

#### 6.6.2.2 Minimum Requirements

The minimum requirement for *IAB type 1-H* is in TS 38.174 \[2\] clause
6.6.2.

#### 6.6.2.3 Test purpose

The test purpose is to verify that the emission at the *TAB connector*
does not occupy an excessive bandwidth for the service to be provided
and is, therefore, not likely to create interference to other users of
the spectrum beyond undue limits.

#### 6.6.2.4 Method of test

##### 6.6.2.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: Normal; see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier: M; see clause 4.9.1.

*Aggregated IAB channel bandwidth* positions to be tested for contiguous
carrier aggregation: M~BW\ Channel\ CA~; see clause 4.9.1.

> 1\) Connect the measurement device to *TAB connector* as shown in
> annex D.1.1 for *IAB type 1-H*.
>
> 2\) For a IAB declared to be capable of single carrier operation
> (D.16), start transmission according to the applicable test
> configuration in clause 4.8 using the corresponding test model
> IAB-DU-FR1-TM1.1 for *IAB-DU type 1-H* or IAB-MT-FR1-TM1.1 for *IAB-MT
> type 1-H* at manufacturer\'s declared rated output power
> (P~rated,c,TABC~, D.21).
>
> For an IAB declared to be capable of contiguous CA operation, set the
> IAB to transmit according to IAB-DU-FR1-TM1.1 for *IAB-DU type 1-H* or
> IAB-MT-FR1-TM1.1 for *IAB-MT type 1-H* on all carriers configured
> using the applicable test configuration and corresponding power
> setting specified in clauses 4.7.4 and 4.8.

##### 6.6.2.4.2 Procedure

1\) Measure the spectrum emission of the transmitted signal using at
least the number of measurement points, and across a span, as listed in
table 6.6.2.4.2-1. The selected resolution bandwidth (RBW) filter of the
analyser shall be 30 kHz or less.

NOTE: The detection mode of the spectrum analyser will not have any
effect on the result if the statistical properties of the out-of-OBW
power are the same as those of the inside-OBW power. Both are expected
to have the Rayleigh distribution of the amplitude of Gaussian noise. In
any case where the statistics are not the same, though, the detection
mode must be power responding. The analyser may be set to respond to the
average of the power (root-mean-square of the voltage) across the
measurement cell.

2\) Compute the total of the power, P0, (in power units, not decibel
units) of all the measurement cells in the measurement span. Compute P1,
the power outside the occupied bandwidth on each side. P1 is half of the
total power outside the bandwidth. P1 is half of (100 % - (occupied
percentage)) of P0. For the occupied percentage of 99 %, P1 is 0.005
times P0.

3\) Determine the lowest frequency, f1, for which the sum of all power
in the measurement cells from the beginning of the span to f1 exceeds
P1.

4\) Determine the highest frequency, f2, for which the sum of all power
in the measurement cells from f2 to the end of the span exceeds P1.

5\) Compute the occupied bandwidth as f2 - f1.

In addition, for a multi-band capable IAB, the following step shall
apply:

6\) For multi-band capable IAB and single band tests, repeat the steps
above per involved band where single carrier test models shall apply,
with no carrier activated in the other band. In addition, when
contiguous CA is supported, single band test configurations and test
models shall apply with no carrier activated in the other band.

#### 6.6.2.5 Test requirements

The occupied bandwidth for each carrier shall be less than the channel
bandwidth as defined in TS 38.174 \[2\], table 5.3.5-1. For contiguous
CA, t**he occupied bandwidth shall be less than or equal to the
*aggregated IAB channel bandwidth* as defined in** TS 38.174 \[2\],
clause 5.3A.

### 6.6.3 Adjacent Channel Leakage Power Ratio

#### 6.6.3.1 General

Adjacent Channel Leakage power Ratio (ACLR) is the ratio of the filtered
mean power centred on the assigned channel frequency to the filtered
mean power centred on an adjacent channel frequency.

The requirements shall apply outside the *IAB-DU RF Bandwidth, IAB-MT RF
Bandwidth* or *Radio Bandwidth* whatever the type of transmitter
considered (single carrier or multi-carrier) and for all transmission
modes foreseen by the manufacturer's specification.

For an *IAB- node* operating in *non-contiguous spectrum*, the ACLR
requirement in clause 6.6.3.2 shall apply in *sub-block gaps* for the
frequency ranges defined in table 6.6.3.2-3, while the CACLR requirement
in clause 6.6.3.2 shall apply in *sub-block gaps* for the frequency
ranges defined in table 6.6.3.2-4.

For a *multi-band connector*, the ACLR requirement in clause 6.6.3.2
shall apply in *Inter RF Bandwidth gaps* for the frequency ranges
defined in table 6.6.3.2-3, while the CACLR requirement in clause
6.6.3.2 shall apply in *Inter RF Bandwidth gaps* for the frequency
ranges defined in table 6.6.3.2-4.

The requirement shall apply during the *transmitter ON period*.

#### 6.6.3.2 Minimum requirement

The minimum requirement applies per *single-band connector*, or per
*multi-band connector* supporting transmission in the *operating band*.

The minimum requirement for *IAB type 1-H* is defined in
TS 38.174 \[2\], clause 6.6.3.

#### 6.6.3.3 Test purpose

To verify that the adjacent channel leakage power ratio requirement
shall be met as specified by the minimum requirement.

#### 6.6.3.4 Method of test

##### 6.6.3.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: Normal; see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier: B, M and T; see
clause 4.9.1.

*IAB RF Bandwidth* positions to be tested for multi-carrier and/or CA:

\- B~RFBW~, M~RFBW~ and T~RFBW~ in single-band operation; see
clause 4.9.1.

\- B~RFBW~\_T\'~RFBW~ and B\'~RFBW~\_T~RFBW~ in multi-band operation,
see clause 4.9.1.

##### 6.6.3.4.2 Procedure

For *IAB type 1-H* where there may be multiple *TAB connectors*, they
may be tested one at a time or multiple *TAB connectors* may be tested
in parallel as shown in annex D.1.1. Whichever method is used the
procedure is repeated until all *TAB connectors* necessary to
demonstrate conformance have been tested.

1\) Connect the *single-band connector* or *multi-band connector* under
test to measurement equipment as shown in annex D.1.1 for *IAB type
1-H*. All connectors not under test shall be terminated.

The measurement device characteristics shall be:

> \- Measurement filter bandwidth: defined in clause 6.6.3.5.

\- Detection mode: true RMS voltage or true average power.

2\) For a connectors declared to be capable of single carrier operation
only (D.16), set the representative connectors under test to transmit
according to the applicable test configuration in clause 4.8 using the
corresponding test models IAB-DU-FR1‑TM1.1 or IAB-MT-FR1-TM1.1 in
clause 4.9.2 at *rated carrier output power* P~rated,c,TABC~ for IAB
type 1-H (D.21).

For a connector under test declared to be capable of multi-carrier
and/or CA operation (D.15-D.16) set the connector under test to transmit
on all carriers configured using the applicable test configuration and
corresponding power setting specified in clauses 4.7 and 4.8 using the
corresponding test models or set of physical channels in clause 4.9.2.

3\) Measure ACLR for the frequency offsets both side of channel
frequency as specified in table 6.6.3.5.2‑1. In multiple carrier case
only offset frequencies below the lowest and above the highest carrier
frequency used shall be measured.

4\) For the ACLR requirement applied inside sub-block gap for
non-contiguous spectrum operation, or inside *Inter RF Bandwidth gap*
for multi-band operation:

a\) Measure ACLR inside sub-block gap or *Inter RF Bandwidth gap* as
specified in clause 6.6.3.5.2, if applicable.

b\) Measure CACLR inside sub-block gap or *Inter RF Bandwidth gap* as
specified in clause 6.6.3.5.2, if applicable.

5\) Repeat the test with the channel set-up according to
IAB-DU-FR1-TM1.2 in clause 4.9.2.

In addition, for *multi-band connectors*, the following steps shall
apply:

6\) For a *multi-band connectors* and single band tests, repeat the
steps above per involved *operating band* where single band test
configurations and test models shall apply with no carrier activated in
the other *operating band*.

#### 6.6.3.5 Test requirements

##### 6.6.3.5.1 General requirements

The ACLR requirements in clause 6.6.3.5.2 shall apply as described in
clauses 6.6.3.5.3 or 6.6.3.5.4.

##### 6.6.3.5.2 Limits and *basic limits*

The ACLR is defined with a square filter of bandwidth equal to the
transmission bandwidth configuration of the transmitted signal
(BW~Config~) centred on the assigned channel frequency and a filter
centred on the adjacent channel frequency according to the tables below.

For operation in paired and unpaired spectrum, the ACLR shall be higher
than the value specified in table 6.6.3.5.2‑1.

The Cumulative Adjacent Channel Leakage power Ratio (CACLR) in a
*sub-block gap* or the *Inter RF Bandwidth gap* is the ratio of:

a\) the sum of the filtered mean power centred on the assigned channel
frequencies for the two carriers adjacent to each side of the *sub-block
gap* or the *Inter RF Bandwidth gap*, and

b\) the filtered mean power centred on a frequency channel adjacent to
one of the respective *sub-block* edges or *IAB RF Bandwidth edges*.

The assumed filter for the adjacent channel frequency is defined in
table 6.6.3.2-4 and the filters on the assigned channels are defined in
table 6.6.3.2-6.

For operation in *non-contiguous spectrum* or multiple bands, the CACLR
for NR carriers located on either side of the *sub-block gap* or the
*Inter RF Bandwidth gap* shall be higher than the value specified in
table 6.6.3.2-4.

### 6.6.4 Operating band unwanted emissions

#### 6.6.4.1 Definition and applicability

Unless otherwise stated, the operating band unwanted emission (OBUE)
limits for IAB-DU in FR1 are defined from Δf~OBUE~ below the lowest
frequency of each supported downlink *operating band* up to Δf~OBUE~
above the highest frequency of each supported downlink *operating band*.
The values of Δf~OBUE~ are defined in table 6.6.1‑1 for the NR
*operating bands*.

Unless otherwise stated, the operating band unwanted emission (OBUE)
limits for IAB-MT in FR1 are defined from Δf~OBUE~ below the lowest
frequency of each supported uplink *operating band* up to Δf~OBUE~ above
the highest frequency of each supported uplink *operating band*. The
values of Δf~OBUE~ are defined in table 6.6.1‑2 for the NR *operating
bands*.

The requirements shall apply whatever the type of transmitter considered
and for all transmission modes foreseen by the manufacturer's
specification. In addition, for IAB-DU and IAB-MT operating in
*non-contiguous spectrum*, the requirements apply inside any *sub-block
gap*. In addition, for a IAB-MT or IAB-DU operating in multiple bands,
the requirements apply inside any *Inter RF Bandwidth gap*.

*Basic limits* are specified in the tables below, where:

\- ∆f is the separation between the *channel edge* frequency and the
nominal -3dB point of the measuring filter closest to the carrier
frequency.

\- f\_offset is the separation between the *channel edge* frequency and
the centre of the measuring filter.

\- f\_offset~max~ is the offset to the frequency Δf~OBUE~ outside the
downlink *operating band of IAB-DU and uplink operating band of IAB-MT*,
where Δf~OBUE~ is defined in tables 6.6.1-1 and 6.6.1-2.

\- ∆f~max~ is equal to f\_offset~max~ minus half of the bandwidth of the
measuring filter.

For a *multi-band connector* inside any *Inter RF Bandwidth gaps* with
W~gap~ \< 2\*Δf~OBUE~, a combined *basic* limit shall be applied which
is the cumulative sum of the *basic limit*s specified at the *IAB RF
Bandwidth edges* on each side of the *Inter RF Bandwidth gap*. The
*basic limit* for *IAB RF Bandwidth edge* is specified in clauses
6.6.4.2.1 to 6.6.4.2.4 below, where in this case:

\- ∆f is the separation between the *IAB RF Bandwidth edge* frequency
and the nominal -3 dB point of the measuring filter closest to the *IAB
RF Bandwidth edge*.

\- f\_offset is the separation from the *IAB RF Bandwidth edge*
frequency to the centre of the measuring filter.

\- f\_offset~max~ is equal to the *Inter RF Bandwidth gap* minus half of
the bandwidth of the measuring filter.

\- ∆f~max~ is equal to f\_offset~max~ minus half of the bandwidth of the
measuring filter.

For a *multi-band connector of IAB-DU*, the operating band unwanted
emission limits apply also in a supported downlink *operating band*
without any carrier transmitted, in the case where there are carrier(s)
transmitted in another supported downlink *operating band*. In this
case, no cumulative *basic limit* is applied in the *inter-band gap*
between a supported downlink *operating band* with carrier(s)
transmitted and a supported downlink *operating band* without any
carrier transmitted and

\- In case the *inter-band gap* between a supported downlink *operating
band* with carrier(s) transmitted and a supported downlink *operating
band* without any carrier transmitted is less than 2\*Δf~OBUE~,
f\_offset~max~ shall be the offset to the frequency Δf~OBUE~ MHz outside
the outermost edges of the two supported downlink *operating bands* and
the operating band unwanted emission *basic limits* of the band where
there are carriers transmitted, as defined in the tables of the present
clause, shall apply across both downlink bands.

\- In other cases, the operating band unwanted emission *basic limits*
of the band where there are carriers transmitted, as defined in the
tables of the present clause for the largest frequency offset (∆f~max~),
shall apply from Δf~OBUE~ MHz below the lowest frequency, up to Δf~OBUE~
MHz above the highest frequency of the supported downlink *operating
band* without any carrier transmitted.

For a *multi-band connector of IAB-MT*, the operating band unwanted
emission limits apply also in a supported uplink *operating band*
without any carrier transmitted, in the case where there are carrier(s)
transmitted in another supported uplink *operating band*. In this case,
no cumulative *basic limit* is applied in the *inter-band gap* between a
supported uplink *operating band* with carrier(s) transmitted and a
supported uplink *operating band* without any carrier transmitted and

\- In case the inter-band gap between a supported uplink operating band
with carrier(s) transmitted and a supported uplink operating band
without any carrier transmitted is less than 2\* Δf~OBUE~, f\_offsetmax
shall be the offset to the frequency Δf~OBUE~ MHz outside the outermost
edges of the two supported uplink operating bands and the operating band
unwanted emission basic limits of the band where there are carriers
transmitted, as defined in the tables of the present clause, shall apply
across both uplink bands.

\- In other cases, the operating band unwanted emission basic limits of
the band where there are carriers transmitted, as defined in the tables
of the present clause for the largest frequency offset (∆fmax), shall
apply from Δf~OBUE~ MHz below the lowest frequency, up to Δf~OBUE~ MHz
above the highest frequency of the supported uplink operating band
without any carrier transmitted.

For a multicarrier *single-band connector* or a *single-band connector*
configured for intra-band contiguous or non-contiguous *carrier
aggregation* the definitions above apply to the lower edge of the
carrier transmitted at the *lowest carrier* frequency and the upper edge
of the carrier transmitted at the *highest carrier* frequency within a
specified frequency band.

In addition, inside any *sub-block gap* for a *single-band connector*
operating in *non-contiguous spectrum*, a combined *basic* limit shall
be applied which is the cumulative sum of the *basic limit*s specified
for the adjacent *sub-blocks* on each side of the *sub-block gap*. The
*basic limit* for each *sub-block* is specified in clauses 6.6.4.2.1 to
6.6.4.2.4 below, where in this case:

\- ∆f is the separation between the *sub-block* edge frequency and the
nominal -3 dB point of the measuring filter closest to the *sub-block*
edge.

\- f\_offset is the separation between the *sub-block* edge frequency
and the centre of the measuring filter.

\- f\_offset~max~ is equal to the *sub-block gap* bandwidth minus half
of the bandwidth of the measuring filter.

\- ∆f~max~ is equal to f\_offset~max~ minus half of the bandwidth of the
measuring filter.

For Wide Area IAB-DU and Wide Area IAB-MT, the requirements of either
clause 6.6.4.2.1 (Category A limits) or clause 6.6.4.2.2 (Category B
limits) shall apply.

For Medium Range IAB-DU, the requirements in clause 6.6.4.2.3 shall
apply (Category A and B).

For Local Area IAB-DU and Local Area IAB-MT, the requirements of clause
6.6.4.2.4 shall apply (Category A and B).

The application of either Category A or Category B *basic limits* shall
be the same as for Transmitter spurious emissions in clause 6.6.5.

#### 6.6.4.2 Minimum requirement

The minimum requirement applies per single-band connector, or per
multi-band connector supporting transmission in the operating band.

The minimum requirement for *IAB type 1-H* are defined in TS 38.174
\[2\], clause 6.6.4.2.

#### 6.6.4.3 Test purpose

This test measures the emissions close to the assigned channel bandwidth
of the wanted signal, while the transmitter is in operation.

#### 6.6.4.4 Method of test

##### 6.6.4.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: Normal; see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier: B, M and T; see
clause 4.9.1.

*IAB RF Bandwidth* positions to be tested for multi-carrier:

\- B~RFBW~, M~RFBW~ and T~RFBW~ in single-band operation; see
clause 4.9.1.

\- B~RFBW~\_T\'~RFBW~ and B\'~RFBW~\_T~RFBW~ in multi-band operation,
see clause 4.9.1.

##### 6.6.4.4.2 Procedure

For *IAB type 1-H* where there may be multiple *TAB connectors*, they
may be tested one at a time or multiple *TAB connectors* may be tested
in parallel as shown in annex D.1.1. Whichever method is used the
procedure is repeated until all *TAB connectors* necessary to
demonstrate conformance have been tested.

1\) Connect the *single-band connector* or *multi-band connector* under
test to measurement equipment as shown in annex D.1.1 for *IAB type
1-H*. All connectors not under test shall be terminated.

As a general rule, the resolution bandwidth of the measuring equipment
should be equal to the measurement bandwidth. However, to improve
measurement accuracy, sensitivity, efficiency and avoiding e.g. carrier
leakage, the resolution bandwidth may be smaller than the measurement
bandwidth. When the resolution bandwidth is smaller than the measurement
bandwidth, the result should be integrated over the measurement
bandwidth in order to obtain the equivalent noise bandwidth of the
measurement bandwidth.

The measurement device characteristics shall be:

\- Detection mode: True RMS.

2\) For a connectors declared to be capable of single carrier operation
only, set the representative connectors under test to transmit according
to the applicable test configuration in clause 4.8 at *rated carrier
output power* P~rated,c,TABC~ (D.21). Channel set-up shall be according
to IAB-DU-FR1-TM1.1 or IAB-MT-FR1-TM1.1.

For a connector under test declared to be capable of multi-carrier
and/or CA operation set the connector under test to transmit on all
carriers configured using the applicable test configuration and
corresponding power setting specified in clauses 4.7 and 4.8 using the
corresponding test models or set of physical channels in clause 4.9.2.

3\) Step the centre frequency of the measurement filter in contiguous
steps and measure the emission within the specified frequency ranges
with the specified measurement bandwidth. For connector under test
declared to operate in multiple bands or non-contiguous spectrum, the
emission within the *Inter RF Bandwidth* or *sub-block gap* shall be
measured using the specified measurement bandwidth from the closest RF
Bandwidth or sub block edge.

4\) Repeat the test for the remaining test cases, with the channel
set-up according to IAB-DU-FR1-TM1.2.

In addition, for *multi-band connectors*, the following steps shall
apply:

5\) For a *multi-band connectors* and single band tests, repeat the
steps above per involved *operating band* where single band test
configurations and test models shall apply with no carrier activated in
the other *operating band*.

##### 6.6.4.5.5 *Basic limits* for additional requirements

###### 6.6.4.5.5.1 Limits in FCC Title 47

In addition to the requirements in clauses 6.6.4.2.1, 6.6.4.2.2,
6.6.4.2.3 and 6.6.4.2.4, the IAB-DU and IAB-MT may have to comply with
the applicable emission limits established by FCC Title 47 \[7\], when
deployed in regions where those limits are applied, and under the
conditions declared by the manufacturer.

##### 6.6.4.5.6 *IAB type 1-H*

The operating band unwanted emissions requirements for *IAB type 1-H*
are that for each *TAB connector TX min cell group* and each applicable
*basic limit* in clause 6.6.4.2, the power summation emissions at the
*TAB connectors* of the *TAB connector TX min cell group* shall not
exceed a limit specified as the *basic limit* + X, where X =
10log~10~(N~TXU,countedpercell~).

NOTE: Conformance to the *IAB type 1-H* operating band unwanted emission
requirement can be demonstrated by meeting at least one of the following
criteria as determined by the manufacturer:

> 1\) The sum of the emissions power measured on each *TAB connector* in
> the *TAB connector TX min cell group* shall be less than or equal to
> the limit as defined in this clause for the respective frequency span.

Or

> 2\) The unwanted emissions power at each *TAB connector* shall be less
> than or equal to the *type 1-H* limit as defined in this clause for
> the respective frequency span, scaled by -10log~10~(n), where n is the
> number of *TAB connectors* in the *TAB connector TX min cell group*.

### 6.6.5 Transmitter spurious emissions

#### 6.6.5.1 Definition and applicability

For IAB-DU, the transmitter spurious emission limits shall apply from
9 kHz to 12.75 GHz, excluding the frequency range from Δf~OBUE~ below
the lowest frequency of each supported downlink *operating band*, up to
Δf~OBUE~ above the highest frequency of each supported downlink
*operating band*, where the Δf~OBUE~ is defined in table 6.6.1-1. For
some *operating bands*, the upper limit is higher than 12.75 GHz in
order to comply with the 5^th^ harmonic limit of the downlink *operating
band*, as specified in Recommendation ITU-R SM.329 \[5\].

For IAB-MT, the transmitter spurious emission limits shall apply from
9 kHz to 12.75 GHz, excluding the frequency range from Δf~OBUE~ below
the lowest frequency of each supported uplink *operating band*, up to
Δf~OBUE~ above the highest frequency of each supported uplink *operating
band*, where the Δf~OBUE~ is defined in table 6.6.1-2. For some
*operating bands*, the upper limit is higher than 12.75 GHz in order to
comply with the 5^th^ harmonic limit of the uplink *operating band*, as
specified in Recommendation ITU-R SM.329 \[5\].

For a *multi-band connector*, for each supported *operating band*
together with Δf~OBUE~ around the band is excluded from the transmitter
spurious emissions requirement.

The requirements shall apply whatever the type of transmitter considered
(single carrier or multi-carrier). It applies for all transmission modes
foreseen by the manufacturer\'s specification.

Unless otherwise stated, all requirements are measured as mean power
(RMS).

#### 6.6.5.2 Minimum requirement

The minimum requirement applies per *single-band connector*, or per
*multi-band connector* supporting transmission in the *operating band*.

The minimum requirement for *IAB type 1-H* are defined in
TS 38.174 \[2\], clause 6.6.5.

#### 6.6.5.3 Test purpose

This test measures conducted spurious emissions while the transmitter is
in operation.

#### 6.6.5.4 Method of test

##### 6.6.5.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: Normal; see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier:

\- B when testing the spurious emissions below F~DL\_low~ - Δf~OBUE~ for
IAB-DU or F~UL\_low~ - Δf~OBUE~ for IAB-MT~,~

\- T when testing the spurious emissions above F~DL\_high~ + Δf~OBUE~
for IAB-DU or F~UL\_high~ + Δf~OBUE~ for IAB-MT; see clause 4.9.1.

*IAB RF Bandwidth* positions to be tested for multi-carrier and/or CA:

\- B~RFBW~ when testing the spurious frequencies below F~DL\_low~ -
Δf~OBUE~ for IAB-DU or F~UL\_low~ - Δf~OBUE~ for IAB-MT; T~RFBW~ when
testing the spurious frequencies above F~DL\_high~ + Δf~OBUE~ for IAB-DU
or F~UL\_high~ + Δf~OBUE~ for IAB-MT in single-band operation; see
clause 4.9.1.

\- B~RFBW~\_T\'~RFBW~ when testing the spurious frequencies below
F~DL\_low~ - Δf~OBUE~ for IAB-DU or F~UL\_low~ - Δf~OBUE~ for IAB-MT of
the lowest operating band; B\'~RFBW~\_T~RFBW~ when testing the spurious
frequencies above F~DL\_high~ + Δf~OBUE~ for IAB-DU or F~UL\_high~ +
Δf~OBUE~ for IAB-MT of the highest operating band in multi-band
operation, see clause 4.9.1.

##### 6.6.5.4.2 Procedure

For *IAB type 1-H* where there may be multiple *TAB connectors*, they
may be tested one at a time or multiple *TAB connectors* may be tested
in parallel as shown in annex D.13.1. Whichever method is used the
procedure is repeated until all *TAB connectors* necessary to
demonstrate conformance have been tested.

1\) Connect the *single-band connector* or *multi-band connector* under
test to measurement equipment as shown in annex D.1.1. All connectors
not under test shall be terminated.

2\) Measurements shall use a measurement bandwidth in accordance to the
conditions in clause 6.6.5.5.

The measurement device characteristics shall be:

\- Detection mode: True RMS.

3\) For a connectors declared to be capable of single carrier operation
only (D.16), set the representative connectors under test to transmit
according to the applicable test configuration in clause 4.8 at *rated
carrier output power* (P~rated,c,AC~, or P~rated,c,TABC~, D.21). Channel
set-up shall be according to IAB-DU-FR1‑TM1.1 or IAB-MT-FR1-TM1.1.

For a connector under test declared to be capable of multi-carrier
and/or CA operation (D.15-D.16) set the connector under test to transmit
on all carriers configured using the applicable test configuration and
corresponding power setting specified in clauses 4.7 and 4.8 using the
corresponding test models or set of physical channels in clause 4.9.2.

4\) Measure the emission at the specified frequencies with specified
measurement bandwidth.

In addition, for *multi-band connectors*, the following steps shall
apply:

5\) For a *multi-band connectors* and single band tests, repeat the
steps above per involved *operating band* where single band test
configurations and test models shall apply with no carrier activated in
the other *operating band*.

#### 6.6.5.5 Test requirements

##### 6.6.5.5.1 Basic limits

###### 6.6.5.5.1.1 Tx spurious emissions

The *basic limits* of either table 6.6.5.5.1.1-1 (Category A limits) or
table 6.6.5.5.1.1-2 (Category B limits) shall apply. The application of
either Category A or Category B limits shall be the same as for
operating band unwanted emissions in clause 6.6.4.

##### 6.6.5.5.2 Additional spurious emissions requirements

These requirements may be applied for the protection of system operating
in other frequency ranges. The limits may apply as an optional
protection of such systems that are deployed in the same geographical
area as the IAB-node, or they may be set by local or regional regulation
as a mandatory requirement for an NR *operating band*. It is in some
cases not stated in the present document whether a requirement is
mandatory or under what exact circumstances that a limit applies, since
this is set by local or regional regulation. An overview of regional
requirements in the present document is given in clause 4.5.

Some requirements may apply for the protection of specific equipment
(UE, MS and/or BS) or equipment operating in specific systems (GSM,
CDMA, UTRA, E-UTRA, NR, etc.) as listed below.

The spurious emission *basic limits* are provided in table 6.6.5.5.2-1
where requirements for co-existence with the system listed in the first
column apply for IAB-MT and IAB-DU. For a *multi-band connector*, the
exclusions and conditions in the Note column of table 6.6.5.5.2-1 apply
for each supported *operating band*.

NOTE 1: As defined in the scope for spurious emissions in this clause
the co-existence requirements in table 6.6.5.2.2-1 do not apply for the
Δf~OBUE~ frequency range immediately outside the downlink *operating
band* (see table 5.2-1). Emission limits for this excluded frequency
range may be covered by local or regional requirements.

NOTE 2: Table 6.6.5.2.2-1 assumes that two *operating bands*, where the
frequency ranges in table 5.2-1 would be overlapping, are not deployed
in the same geographical area. For such a case of operation with
overlapping frequency arrangements in the same geographical area,
special co-existence requirements may apply that are not covered by the
3GPP specifications.

##### 6.6.5.5.3 Co-location with base stations and IAB-nodes

These requirements may be applied for the protection of other BS, IAB-DU
or IAB-MT receivers when GSM900, DCS1800, PCS1900, GSM850, CDMA850, UTRA
FDD, UTRA TDD, E-UTRA, NR BS, IAB-DU or IAB-MT are co-located with
IAB-MT and/or IAB-DU.

The requirements assume a 30 dB coupling loss between transmitter and
receiver and are based on co-location with same class.

The *basic limits* are in table 6.6.5.2.3-1 for an IAB-DU and IAB-MT.
Requirements for co-location with a system listed in the first column
apply, depending on the declared IAB-DU and IAB-MT class. For a
*multi-band connector*, the exclusions and conditions in the Note column
of table 6.6.5.2.3-1 shall apply for each supported *operating band*.

NOTE 1: As defined in the scope for spurious emissions in this clause,
the co-location requirements in table 6.6.5.2.3-1 do not apply for the
frequency range extending Δf~OBUE~ immediately outside the transmit
frequency range of a IAB-MT and IAB-DU. The current state-of-the-art
technology does not allow a single generic solution for co-location with
other system on adjacent frequencies for 30dB antenna to antenna minimum
coupling loss. However, there are certain site-engineering solutions
that can be used. These techniques are addressed in TR 25.942 \[8\].

NOTE 2: Table 6.6.5.2.3-1 assumes that two *operating bands*, where the
corresponding transmit and receive frequency ranges in table 5.2-1 would
be overlapping, are not deployed in the same geographical area. For such
a case of operation with overlapping frequency arrangements in the same
geographical area, special co-location requirements may apply that are
not covered by the 3GPP specifications.

#### 6.6.5.6 *IAB type 1-H*

The Tx spurious emissions requirements for *IAB type 1-H* are that for
each *TAB connector TX min cell group* and each applicable *basic limit*
in clause 6.6.5.2, the power summation of emissions at the *TAB
connectors* of the *TAB connector TX min cell group* shall not exceed a
limit specified as the *basic limit* + X, where X =
10log~10~(N~TXU,countedpercell~), unless stated differently in regional
regulation.

NOTE: Conformance to the *IAB type 1-H* spurious emission requirement
can be demonstrated by meeting at least one of the following criteria as
determined by the manufacturer:

1\) The sum of the emissions power measured on each *TAB connector* in
the *TAB connector TX min cell group* shall be less than or equal to the
limit as defined in this clause for the respective frequency span.

Or

2\) The unwanted emissions power at each *TAB connector* shall be less
than or equal to the *type 1-H* limit as defined in this clause for the
respective frequency span, scaled by -10log~10~(n), where n is the
number of *TAB connectors* in the *TAB connector TX min cell group*.

6.7 Transmitter intermodulation
-------------------------------

### 6.7.1 Definition and applicability

The transmitter intermodulation requirement is a measure of the
capability of the transmitter unit to inhibit the generation of signals
in its non-linear elements caused by presence of the wanted signal and
an interfering signal reaching the transmitter unit via the antenna, RDN
and antenna array. The requirement shall apply during the transmitter ON
period and the *transmitter transient period*.

For *IAB type 1-H*, the transmitter intermodulation level is the power
of the intermodulation products when an interfering signal is injected
into the *TAB connector*.

For *IAB type 1-H*, there are two types of transmitter intermodulation
cases captured by the transmitter intermodulation requirement:

1\) Co-location transmitter intermodulation in which the interfering
signal is from a co-located base station.

2\) Intra-system transmitter intermodulation in which the interfering
signal is from other transmitter units within the *IAB type 1-H*.

For *IAB type 1-H*, the co-location transmitter intermodulation
requirement is considered sufficient if the interference signal for the
co-location requirement is higher than the declared interference signal
for intra-system transmitter (D.30) intermodulation requirement.

### 6.7.2 Minimum requirement

The minimum requirement applies per *single-band connector*, or per
*multi-band connector* supporting transmission in the *operating band*.

The minimum requirement for *IAB type 1-H* is defined in
TS 38.174 \[2\], clause 6.7.2.

### 6.7.3 Test purpose

The test purpose is to verify the ability of the transmitter units
associated with the *single-band connectors* or *multi-band connector*
under test to restrict the generation of intermodulation products in its
nonlinear elements caused by presence of the wanted signal and an
interfering signal reaching the transmitter via the antenna to below
specified levels.

### 6.7.4 Method of test

#### 6.7.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: Normal; see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier: M; see clause 4.9.1.

*IAB RF Bandwidth* positions to be tested for multi-carrier and/or CA:

\- M~RFBW~ in single-band operation; see clause 4.9.1.

\- B~RFBW~\_T\'~RFBW~ and B\'~RFBW~\_T~RFBW~ in multi-band operation,
see clause 4.9.1.

NOTE: When testing in M (or M~RFBW~), if the interferer is fully or
partially located outside the supported frequency range, then the
test shall be done instead in B (or B~RFBW~) and T (or T~RFBW~), and
only with the interferer located inside the supported frequency range.

#### 6.7.4.2 Procedure

For *IAB type 1-H* where there may be multiple *TAB connectors*, they
may be tested one at a time or multiple *TAB connectors* may be tested
in parallel as shown in annex D.1.1. Whichever method is used the
procedure is repeated until all *TAB connectors* necessary to
demonstrate conformance have been tested.

1\) Connect the *single-band connector* or *multi-band connector* under
test to measurement equipment as shown in annex D.1.2 for *IAB type
1-H*. All connectors not under test shall be terminated.

2\) The measurement device characteristics shall be:

\- Detection mode: True RMS.

3\) For a connectors declared to be capable of single carrier operation
only (D.16), set the representative connectors under test to transmit
according to the applicable test configuration in clause 4.8 at *rated
carrier output power* P~rated,c,TABC~ for *IAB type 1-H* (D.21). Channel
set-up shall be according to IAB-DU-FR1-TM 1.1 for IAB-DU and
IAB-MT-FR1-TM1.1 for IAB-MT.

For a connector under test declared to be capable of multi-carrier
and/or CA operation (D.15-D.16) set the connector under test to transmit
on all carriers configured using the applicable test configuration and
corresponding power setting specified in clauses 4.7 and 4.8 using the
corresponding test models or set of physical channels in clause 4.9.2
for IAB-DU and IAB-MT.

4\) For IAB 1-H, generate the interfering signal according to
IAB-DU-FR1-TM1.1 for IAB-DU and IAB-MT-FR1-TM1.1 for IAB-MT, as defined
in clause 4.9.2, with the minimum channel bandwidth (BW~Channel~) with
15 kHz SCS of the band defined in clause 5.3.5 and a centre frequency
offset from the lower/upper edge of the wanted signal or edge of
sub-block inside a sub-block gap , for n = 1, 2 and 3, but exclude
interfering frequencies that are outside of the allocated downlink
operating band or interfering frequencies that are not completely within
the sub-block gap or within the *Inter RF Bandwidth gap*.

5\) Adjust ATT attenuator (as in the test setup in annex D.1.2 for *IAB
type 1-H*) so that level of the interfering signal is as defined in
clause 6.7.5.

6\) Perform the unwanted emission tests specified in clauses 6.6.3 and
6.6.4 for all third and fifth order intermodulation products which
appear in the frequency ranges defined in clauses 6.6.3 and 6.6.4. The
width of the intermodulation products shall be taken into account.

7\) Perform the transmitter spurious emissions test as specified in
clause 6.6.5, for all third and fifth order intermodulation products
which appear in the frequency ranges defined in clause 6.6.5. The width
of the intermodulation products shall be taken into account.

8\) Verify that the emission level does not exceed the required level in
clause 6.7.5 with the exception of interfering signal frequencies.

9\) Repeat the test for the remaining interfering signal centre
frequency offsets according to step 4.

10\) Repeat the test for the remaining test signals defined in
clause 6.7.5 for additional requirements and for *IAB type 1-H*
intra-system requirements.

In addition, for *multi-band connectors*, the following steps shall
apply:

11\) For a *multi-band connectors* and single band tests, repeat the
steps above per involved *operating band* where single band test
configurations and test models shall apply with no carrier activated in
the other *operating band*.

NOTE: The third order intermodulation products are centred at 2F1±F2 and
2F2±F1. The fifth order intermodulation products are centred at 3F1±2F2,
3F2±2F1, 4F1±F2, and 4F2±F1 where F1 represents the test signal centre
frequency or centre frequency of each sub-block and F2 represents the
interfering signal centre frequency. The widths of intermodulation
products are:

> \- (n\*BW~F1~ + m\* BW~F2~) for the nF1±mF2 products;
>
> \- (n\* BW~F2~ + m\* BW~F1~) for the nF2±mF1 products;

where BW~F1~ represents the test wanted signal RF bandwidth or channel
bandwidth in case of single carrier, or sub-block bandwidth and BW~F2~
represents the interfering signal channel bandwidth.

### 6.7.5 Test requirements

#### 6.7.5.1 *IAB type 1-H*

##### 6.7.5.1.1 Co-location minimum requirements

The transmitter intermodulation level shall not exceed the unwanted
emission limits in clauses 6.6.3, 6.6.4 and 6.6.5 in the presence of an
NR interfering signal according to table 6.7.5.1.1-1.

The requirement is applicable outside the *IAB RF Bandwidth edges*. The
interfering signal offset is defined relative to the *IAB RF Bandwidth*
*edges* or *Radio Bandwidth* edges.

For *TAB connectors* supporting operation in *non-contiguous spectrum*,
the requirement is also applicable inside a *sub-block gap* for
interfering signal offsets where the interfering signal falls completely
within the *sub-block gap*. The interfering signal offset is defined
relative to the *sub-block* edges.

For *multi-band connector*, the requirement shall apply relative to the
*IAB RF Bandwidth* *edges* of each operating band. In case the inter RF
Bandwidth gap is less than 3\*BW~Channel~ MHz (where BW~Channel~ is the
minimal *IAB-DU channel bandwidth* and *IAB-MT channel bandwidth* of the
band), the requirement in the gap shall apply only for interfering
signal offsets where the interfering signal falls completely within the
inter RF Bandwidth gap.

  NOTE 1: P~REFSENS~ is the power level of a single instance of the reference measurement channel. This requirement shall be met for each consecutive application of a single instance of the reference measurement channel mapped to disjoint frequency ranges with a width corresponding to the number of resource blocks of the reference measurement channel each, except for one instance that might overlap one other instance to cover the full *IAB-DU channel bandwidth*.

  NOTE 1: P~REFSENS~ is the power level of a single instance of the reference measurement channel. This requirement shall be met for each consecutive application of a single instance of the reference measurement channel mapped to disjoint frequency ranges with a width corresponding to the number of resource blocks of the reference measurement channel each, except for one instance that might overlap one other instance to cover the full *IAB-DU channel bandwidth*.

  NOTE 1: P~REFSENS~ is the power level of a single instance of the reference measurement channel. This requirement shall be met for each consecutive application of a single instance of the reference measurement channel mapped to disjoint frequency ranges with a width corresponding to the number of resource blocks of the reference measurement channel each, except for one instance that might overlap one other instance to cover the full *IAB-DU channel bandwidth*.                                                                                                                        

#### 7.2.5.2 Test requirements for *IAB-MT*

The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference
measurement channel as specified in annex A.1 with parameters specified
in table 7.2.5.2-1 for Wide Area IAB-MT and in table 7.2.5.2-2 for Local
Area IAB-MT.

7.3 Dynamic range
-----------------

### 7.3.1 Definition and applicability

The dynamic range is specified as a measure of the capability of the
receiver to receive a wanted signal in the presence of an interfering
signal at the *TAB connector* for *IAB-DU* inside the received *IAB-DU
channel bandwidth*. In this condition, a throughput requirement shall be
met for a specified reference measurement channel. The interfering
signal for the dynamic range requirement is an AWGN signal.

### 7.3.2 Minimum requirement

The minimum requirement for *IAB type 1-H* for *IAB-DU* is in
TS 38.174 \[2\], clause 7.3.1.

### 7.3.3 Test purpose

To verify that the IAB *type 1-H* *TAB connector* receiver dynamic
range, the relative throughput shall fulfil the specified limit.

### 7.3.4 Method of test

#### 7.3.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: Normal; see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier: M; see clause 4.9.1.

#### 7.3.4.2 Procedure

The minimum requirement is applied to all connectors under test.

The procedure is repeated until all *TAB connectors* necessary to
demonstrate conformance have been tested; see clause 7.1.

1\) Connect the connector under test to measurement equipment as shown
in annex D.2.2 .

2\) Set the signal generator for the wanted signal to transmit as
specified in table 7.3.5-1 to table 7.3.5-3 according to the appropriate
IAB class.

3\) Set the Signal generator for the AWGN interfering signal at the same
frequency as the wanted signal to transmit as specified in table 7.3.5-1
to table 7.3.5-3 according to the appropriate IAB class.

4\) Measure the throughput according to annex A.2.

In addition, for a *multi-band connector*, the following steps shall
apply:

5\) For *multi-band* *connector* and single band tests, repeat the steps
above per involved band where single band test configurations and test
models shall apply with no carrier activated in the other band.

### 7.3.5 Test requirements

The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference
measurement channel as specified in annex A.2 with parameters specified
in table 7.3.2-1 for Wide Area IAB-DU, in table 7.3.2-2 for Medium Range
IAB-DU and in table 7.3.2-3 for Local Area IAB-DU.

  NOTE: The wanted signal mean power is the power level of a single instance of the corresponding reference measurement channel. This requirement shall be met for each consecutive application of a single instance of the reference measurement channel mapped to disjoint frequency ranges with a width corresponding to the number of resource blocks of the reference measurement channel each, except for one instance that might overlap one other instance to cover the full *IAB-DU channel bandwidth*.

  NOTE: The wanted signal mean power is the power level of a single instance of the corresponding reference measurement channel. This requirement shall be met for each consecutive application of a single instance of the reference measurement channel mapped to disjoint frequency ranges with a width corresponding to the number of resource blocks of the reference measurement channel each, except for one instance that might overlap one other instance to cover the full *IAB-DU channel bandwidth*.

7.4 In-band selectivity and blocking
------------------------------------

### 7.4.1 Adjacent Channel Selectivity (ACS)

#### 7.4.1.1 Definition and applicability

Adjacent channel selectivity (ACS) is a measure of the receiver\'s
ability to receive a wanted signal at its assigned channel frequency at
the *TAB connector* for *IAB type 1-H* in the presence of an adjacent
channel signal with a specified centre frequency offset of the
interfering signal to the band edge of a victim system.

#### 7.4.1.2 Minimum requirement

The minimum requirement for *IAB type 1-H*:

> For *IAB-DU* are in TS 38.174 \[2\], clause 7.4.1.2.
>
> For *IAB-MT* are in TS 38.174 \[2\], clause 7.4.1.3.

#### 7.4.1.3 Test purpose

The test purpose is to verify the ability of the IAB receiver filter to
suppress interfering signals in the channels adjacent to the wanted
channel.

#### 7.4.1.4 Method of test

##### 7.4.1.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: Normal; see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier (SC): M; see clause 4.9.1.

*IAB RF Bandwidth p*ositions to be tested for multi-carrier (MC):

> \- M~RFBW~ for *single-band connector(s)*, see clause 4.9.1,
>
> \- B~RFBW~\_T\'~RFBW~ and B\'~RFBW~\_T~RFBW~ for *multi-band
> connector(s),* see clause 4.9.1.

##### 7.4.1.4.2 Procedure

The minimum requirement is applied to all connectors under test.

For *IAB type 1-H* the procedure is repeated until all *TAB connectors*
necessary to demonstrate conformance have been tested; see clause 7.1.

1\) Connect the connector under test to measurement equipment as shown
in annex D.2.3 for *IAB type 1-H*.

2\) For IAB-DU, set the signal generator for the wanted signal to
transmit as specified in table 7.4.1.5.1-1.

For IAB-MT, set the signal generator for the wanted signal to transmit
as specified in table 7.4.1.5.2-1.

3\) For IAB-DU, set the signal generator for the interfering signal to
transmit at the frequency offset and as specified in table 7.4.1.5.1-1
and 7.4.1.5.1-2.

For IAB-MT, set the signal generator for the interfering signal to
transmit at the frequency offset and as specified in table 7.4.1.5.2-1
and 7.4.1.5.2-2.

4\) Measure the throughput according to annex A.1.

In addition, for a *multi-band* *connector*, the following steps shall
apply:

5\) For *multi-band* *connector* and single band tests, repeat the steps
above per involved band where single band test configurations and test
models shall apply with no carrier activated in the other band.

#### 7.4.1.5 Test requirements

##### 7.4.1.5.1 Test requirements for IAB-DU

The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference
measurement channel.

For IAB, the wanted and the interfering signal coupled to the *IAB type
1-H* *TAB connector* are specified in table 7.4.1.5.1-1 and the
frequency offset between the wanted and interfering signal in table
7.4.1.5.1-2 for ACS. The reference measurement channel for the wanted
signal is identified in table 7.2.5.1-1, 7.2.5.1-2 and 7.2.5.1-3 for
each channel bandwidth and further specified in annex A.1. The
characteristics of the interfering signal is further specified in annex
F.

The ACS requirement is applicable outside the IAB RF Bandwidth or Radio
Bandwidth. The interfering signal offset is defined relative to the *IAB
RF Bandwidth edges* or Radio Bandwidth edges.

For a IAB operating in non-contiguous spectrum within any *operating
band*, the ACS requirement shall apply in addition inside any sub-block
gap, in case the sub-block gap size is at least as wide as the NR
interfering signal in table 7.4.1.5.1-2. The interfering signal offset
is defined relative to the sub-block edges inside the sub-block gap.

For a *multi-band connector*, the ACS requirement shall apply in
addition inside any Inter RF Bandwidth gap, in case the Inter RF
Bandwidth gap size is at least as wide as the NR interfering signal in
table 7.4.1.5.1‑2. The interfering signal offset is defined relative to
the *IAB RF Bandwidth edges* inside the Inter RF Bandwidth gap

Conducted requirement is defined at the *TAB connector* for *IAB type
1-H.*

measurement channel.

For IAB-MT, the wanted and the interfering signal coupled to the *IAB
type 1-H* *TAB connector* are specified in table 7.4.1.5.1-1 and the
frequency offset between the wanted and interfering signal in table
7.4.1.5.2-2 for ACS. The reference measurement channel for the wanted

For a *multi-band connector*, the ACS requirement shall apply in
addition inside any *Inter RF Bandwidth gap*, in case the *Inter RF
Bandwidth gap* size is at least as wide as the NR interfering signal in
table 7.4.1.5.2‑2. The interfering signal offset is defined relative to
the *IAB-MT RF Bandwidth edges* inside the *Inter RF Bandwidth gap*.

### 7.4.2 In-band blocking

#### 7.4.2.1 Definition and applicability

The in-band blocking characteristics is a measure of the receiver\'s
ability to receive a wanted signal at its assigned channel at the *TAB
connector* for *IAB type 1-H* in the presence of an unwanted interferer,
which is an NR signal for general blocking or an NR signal with one
resource block for narrowband blocking.

>
> For *IAB-MT* are in TS 38.174 \[2\], clause 7.4.2.3.

#### 7.4.2.3 Test purpose

The test purpose is to verify the ability of the IAB receiver to
withstand high-levels of in-band interference from unwanted signals at
specified frequency offsets without undue degradation of its
sensitivity.

above per involved band where single band test configurations and test
models shall apply with no carrier activated in the other band.

##### 7.4.2.4.3 Procedure for narrowband blocking

The minimum requirement is applied to all connectors under test.

For *IAB type 1-H* the procedure is repeated until all *TAB connectors*
necessary to demonstrate conformance have been tested; see clause 7.1.

1\) Connect the connector under test to measurement equipment as shown
in annex D.2.3 for *IAB type 1-H*.

4\) Measure the throughput according to annex A.1.

In addition, for a *multi-band* *connector*, the following steps shall
apply:

5\) For *multi-band* *connector* and single band tests, repeat the steps
above per involved band where single band test configurations and test
models shall apply with no carrier activated in the other band.

#### 7.4.2.5 Test requirements

##### 7.4.2.5.1 Test requirements for IAB-DU

The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference
measurement channel, with a wanted and an interfering signal coupled to
*IAB type 1‑H* *TAB connector* using the parameters in tables
7.4.2.5.1-1, 7.4.2.5.1-2 and 7.4.2.5.1-3 for general blocking and
narrowband blocking requirements. The reference measurement channel for
the wanted signal is identified in clause 7.2.5.1 for each channel
bandwidth and further specified in annex A.1. The characteristics of the
interfering signal is further specified in annex E.

The in-band blocking requirements apply outside the IAB RF Bandwidth or
Radio Bandwidth. The interfering signal offset is defined relative to
the *IAB RF Bandwidth edges* or *Radio Bandwidth* edges.

For *IAB type 1-H,* the in-band blocking requirement applies from
F~UL\_low~ - Δf~OOB~ to F~UL\_high~ + Δf~OOB~, excluding the downlink
frequency range of the *operating band*. The Δf~OOB~ for *IAB type 1-H*
is defined in table 7.4.2.5.1-0.

Minimum conducted requirement is defined at the *TAB connector* for *IAB
type 1-H.*

Table 7.4.2.5.1-0: Δf~OOB~ offset for NR *operating bands*

  IAB-DU type      *Operating band* characteristics                Δf~OOB~ (MHz)
  ---------------- ----------------------------------------------- ---------------
  *IAB type 1-H*   F~UL\_high~ -- F~UL\_low~ \< 100 MHz            20
                   100 MHz ≤ F~UL\_high~ -- F~UL\_low~ ≤ 900 MHz   60
                   100 MHz ≤ F~UL\_high~ -- F~UL\_low~ ≤ 900 MHz   60

For a IAB operating in non-contiguous spectrum within any *operating
band*, the in-band blocking requirements apply in addition inside any
sub-block gap, in case the sub-block gap size is at least as wide as
twice the interfering signal minimum offset in table 7.4.2.5.1-1. The
interfering signal offset is defined relative to the sub-block edges
inside the sub-block gap.

For a *multi-band connector*, the blocking requirements apply in the
in-band blocking frequency ranges for each supported *operating band*.
The requirement applies in addition inside any Inter RF Bandwidth gap,
in case the Inter RF Bandwidth gap size is at least as wide as twice the
interfering signal minimum offset in table 7.4.2.5.1-1.

For a IAB operating in non-contiguous spectrum within any operating
band, the narrowband blocking requirement applies in addition inside any
sub-block gap, in case the sub-block gap size is at least as wide as the
channel bandwidth of the NR interfering signal in table 7.4.2.5.1-3. The
interfering signal offset is defined relative to the sub-block edges
inside the sub-block gap.

For a *multi-band connector*, the narrowband blocking requirement
applies in addition inside any Inter RF Bandwidth gap, in case the Inter
RF Bandwidth gap size is at least as wide as the NR interfering signal
in table 7.4.2.5.1-3. The interfering signal offset is defined relative
to the *IAB RF Bandwidth edges* inside the *Inter RF Bandwidth gap*.

##### 7.4.2.5.2 Test requirements for IAB-MT

The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference
measurement channel, with a wanted and an interfering signal coupled to
*IAB type 1‑H* *TAB connector* using the parameters in tables
7.4.2.5.2-1, 7.4.2.5.2-2 and 7.4.2.5.2-3 for general blocking and
narrowband blocking requirements. The reference measurement channel for
the wanted signal is identified in clause 7.2.2 for each *IAB-MT channel
bandwidth* and further specified in annex A.1. The characteristics of
the interfering signal is further specified in annex E.

The in-band blocking requirements apply outside the *IAB-MT RF
Bandwidth* or *Radio Bandwidth*. The interfering signal offset is
defined relative to the *IAB-MT RF Bandwidth edges* or *Radio Bandwidth*
edges.

The in-band blocking requirement shall apply from F~DL,low~ - Δf~OOB~ to
F~DL,high~ + Δf~OOB~. The Δf~OOB~ for *wide area IAB-MT* is defined in
table 7.4.2.5.2-0.

Minimum conducted requirement is defined at the *TAB connector* for
*IAB-MT.*

**Table 7.4.2.5.2-0: Δf~OOB~ offset for NR *operating bands***

  **IAB-MT type**   ***Operating band* characteristics**          **Δf~OOB~ (MHz)**
  ----------------- --------------------------------------------- -------------------
  *IAB type 1-H*    F~DL,high~ -- F~DL,low~ \< 100 MHz            20
                    100 MHz ≤ F~DL,high~ -- F~DL,low~ ≤ 900 MHz   60

For an IAB-MT operating in *non-contiguous spectrum* within any
*operating band*, the in-band blocking requirements apply in addition
inside any *sub-block gap*, in case the *sub-block gap* size is at least
as wide as twice the interfering signal minimum offset in Table
7.4.2.5.2-1. The interfering signal offset is defined relative to the
*sub-block* edges inside the *sub-block gap*.

For a *multi-band connector*, the blocking requirements apply in the
in-band blocking frequency ranges for each supported *operating band*.
The requirement shall apply in addition inside any *Inter RF Bandwidth
gap*, in case the *Inter RF Bandwidth gap* size is at least as wide as
twice the interfering signal minimum offset in Table 7.4.2.5.2-1.

For an IAB-MT operating in *non-contiguous spectrum* within any
*operating band*, the narrowband blocking requirement shall apply in
addition inside any *sub-block gap*, in case the *sub-block gap size* is
at least as wide as the channel bandwidth of the NR interfering signal
in Table 7.4.2.5.2-3. The interfering signal offset is defined relative
to the *sub-block* edges inside the *sub-block gap*.

For a *multi-band connector*, the narrowband blocking requirement shall
apply in addition inside any *Inter RF Bandwidth gap*, in case the
*Inter RF Bandwidth gap* size is at least as wide as the NR interfering
signal in Table 7.4.2.5.2-3. The interfering signal offset is defined
relative to the *IAB-MT RF Bandwidth* edges inside the *Inter RF
Bandwidth gap*.

7.5 Out-of-band blocking
------------------------

### 7.5.1 Definition and applicability

The out-of-band blocking characteristics is a measure of the receiver
ability to receive a wanted signal at its assigned channel at the *TAB
connector* for *IAB type 1-H* in the presence of an unwanted interferer
out of the *operating band*, which is a CW signal for out-of-band
blocking.

### 7.5.2 Minimum requirement

The minimum requirement for *IAB type 1-H*:

> For *IAB-DU* are defined in TS 38.174 \[2\], clause 7.5.3.
>
> For *IAB-MT* are defined in TS 38.174 \[2\], clause 7.5.5.

Co-location minimum requirements for *IAB type 1-H*:

> For *IAB-DU* are defined in TS 38.174 \[2\], clause 7.5.4.
>
> For *IAB-MT* are defined in TS 38.174 \[2\], clause 7.5.6.

### 7.5.3 Test purpose

To verify the ability of the receiver to receive a wanted signal at its
assigned channel at the *TAB connector* for *IAB type 1-H* in the
presence of an unwanted interferer out of the *operating band*, which is
a CW signal for out-of-band blocking.

Test environment: Normal; see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier (SC):

> \- M; see clause 4.9.1

*IAB RF Bandwidth p*ositions to be tested for multi-carrier (MC):

> \- M~RFBW~ for *single-band connector(s)*, see clause 4.9.1,
>
> \- B~RFBW~\_T\'~RFBW~ and B\'~RFBW~\_T~RFBW~ for *multi-band
> connector(s),* see clause 4.9.1.

In addition, for a multi-band *connector:*

> \- For B~RFBW~\_T\'~RFBW~, out-of-band blocking testing above the
> highest operating band may be omitted.
>
> \- For B\'~RFBW~\_T~RFBW~, out-of-band blocking testing below the
> lowest operating band may be omitted.

#### 7.5.4.2 Procedure

The minimum requirement is applied to all connectors under test.

For *IAB type 1-H* the procedure is repeated until all *TAB connectors*
necessary to demonstrate conformance have been tested; see clause 7.1.

1\) Connect the connector under test to measurement equipment as shown
in annex D.2.3 for *IAB type 1-H*.

2\) For IAB-DU, set the signal generator for the wanted signal as
defined in clause 7.5.5 to transmit as specified in table 7.5.5.1-1 and
7.5.5.2-1.

For IAB-MT, set the signal generator for the wanted signal as defined in
clause 7.5.5 to transmit as specified in table 7.5.5.3-2 and 7.5.5.4-1.

3\) For IAB-DU, set the Signal generator for the interfering signal to
transmit at the frequency offset and as specified in table 7.5.5.1-1 and
7.5.5.2-1. The CW interfering signal shall be swept with a step size of
1 MHz over than range 1 MHz to (F~UL\_low~ - Δf~OOB~) MHz and
(F~UL\_high~ + Δf~OOB~) MHz to 12750 MHz.

For IAB-MT, set the Signal generator for the interfering signal to
transmit at the frequency offset and as specified in table 7.5.5.3-2 and
7.5.5.4-1. The CW interfering signal shall be swept with a step size of
1 MHz over than range 1 MHz to (F~UL\_low~ - Δf~OOB~) MHz and
(F~UL\_high~ + Δf~OOB~) MHz to 12750 MHz.

4\) Measure the throughput according to annex A.1.

In addition, for a *multi-band* *connector*, the following steps shall
apply:

5\) For *multi-band* *connector* and single band tests, repeat the steps
above per involved band where single band test configurations and test
models shall apply with no carrier activated in the other band.

### 7.5.5 Test requirements

#### 7.5.5.1 General requirements for IAB-DU

The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference
measurement channel, with a wanted and an interfering signal coupled to
*IAB type 1-H* *TAB connector* using the parameters in table 7.5.5.1-1.
The reference measurement channel for the wanted signal is identified in
clause 7.2.2 for each channel bandwidth and further specified in annex
A.1.

For *IAB type 1-H* the out-of-band blocking requirement apply from 1 MHz
to F~UL\_low~ - Δf~OOB~ and from F~UL\_high~ + Δf~OOB~ up to 12750 MHz.
The Δf~OOB~ for *IAB type 1-H* is defined in table 7.4.2.5.1-0.

Minimum conducted requirement is defined at the *TAB connector* for *IAB
type 1-H.*

For a IAB capable of multi-band operation, the requirement in the
out-of-band blocking frequency ranges apply for each *operating band*,
with the exception that the in-band blocking frequency ranges of all
supported *operating bands* according to clause 7.4.2.5 shall be
excluded from the out-of-band blocking requirement.

#### 7.5.5.2 Co-location requirements for IAB-DU

This additional blocking requirement may be applied for the protection
of NR IAB receivers when GSM, CDMA, UTRA, E-UTRA BS or NR IAB operating
in a different frequency band are co-located with a NR IAB. The
requirement is applicable to all channel bandwidths supported by the NR
IAB.

The requirements in this clause assume a 30 dB coupling loss between
interfering transmitter and NR IAB receiver and are based on co-location
with base stations or IAB of the same class.

The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference
measurement channel, with a wanted and an interfering signal coupled to
IAB antenna input using the parameters in table 7.5.5.2-1 for all the
IAB classes. The reference measurement channel for the wanted signal is
identified in tables 7.2.5-1, 7.2.5-2 and 7.2.5-3 for each channel
bandwidth and further specified in annex A.1.

For *IAB type 1-H* blocking requirement for co-location with IAB in
other bands is applied for all operating bands for which co-location
protection is provided.

Minimum conducted requirement is defined at the *TAB connector* for *IAB
type 1-H.*

co-located with BS/IAB in other frequency bands.

#### 7.5.5.3 General requirements for IAB-MT

The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference
measurement channel, with a wanted and an interfering signal coupled to
*IAB type 1-H* *TAB connector* using the parameters in table 7.5.5.3-2.
The reference measurement channel for the wanted signal is identified in
subclause 7.2.1 and subclause 7.2.2 for each *IAB-MT channel bandwidt*h
and further specified in annex A.1.

The out-of-band blocking requirement apply from 1 MHz to F~DL,low~ -
Δf~OOB~ and from F~DL,high~ + Δf~OOB~ up to 12750 MHz. The Δf~OOB~ for
*IAB-MT* is defined in table 7.5.5.3-1.

Table 7.5.5.3-1: Δf~OOB~ offset for NR *operating bands*

  IAB-MT type      *Operating band* characteristics              Δf~OOB~ (MHz)

  *IAB type 1-H*   F~DL,high~ -- F~DL,low~ \< 100 MHz            20
                   100 MHz ≤ F~DL,high~ -- F~DL,low~ ≤ 900 MHz   60

Minimum conducted requirement is defined and at the *TAB connector* for
*IAB-MT type 1-H.*

For a *multi-band connector*, the requirement in the out-of-band
blocking frequency ranges apply for each *operating band*, with the
exception that the in-band blocking frequency ranges of all supported
*operating bands* according to clause 7.4.2.2 shall be excluded from the
out-of-band blocking requirement.

  NOTE 1: For NR, P~REFSENS~ depends also on the *IAB-MT channel bandwidth* as specified in subclause 7.2.1 and subclause 7.2.2.

#### 7.5.5.4 Co-location requirements for IAB-MT

This additional blocking requirement may be applied for the protection
of IAB-MT receivers when GSM, CDMA, UTRA, E-UTRA, NR BS or IAB-node
operating in a different frequency band are co-located with an IAB-node.
The requirement is applicable to all *IAB-MT channel bandwidths*
supported by the IAB-node.

The requirements in this clause assume a 30 dB coupling loss between
interfering transmitter and IAB-node receiver and are based on
co-location with base stations of the same class.

The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference
measurement channel, with a wanted and an interfering signal coupled to
*IAB type 1-H* *TAB connector* input using the parameters in table
7.5.5.4-1 for all the IAB classes. The reference measurement channel for
the wanted signal is identified in subclause 7.2.1 and subclause 7.2.2
for each *IAB-MT channel bandwidth* and further specified in annex A.1.

The blocking requirement for co-location with BS or IAB-node in other
bands is applied for all *operating bands* for which co-location
protection is provided.

Minimum conducted requirement is defined at the *TAB connector* for *IAB
type 1-H.*

7.6 Receiver spurious emissions
-------------------------------

### 7.6.1 Definition and applicability

The receiver spurious emissions power is the power of emissions
generated or amplified in a receiver unit that appear at the *TAB
connector* (for *IAB type 1-H*). The requirements apply to all IAB-DU
and IAB-MT with separate RX and TX *TAB connectors*.

For *TAB connectors* supporting both RX and TX in TDD, the requirements
apply during the *transmitter OFF period*.

For RX-only *multi-band* *connectors*, the spurious emissions
requirements are subject to exclusion zones in each supported *operating
band*. For *multi-band* *connectors* that both transmit and receive in
*operating band* supporting TDD, RX spurious emissions requirements are
applicable during the *TX OFF period*, and are subject to exclusion
zones in each supported *operating band*.

For *IAB type 1-H* manufacturer shall declare *TAB connector RX min cell
groups*. *The declaration is done separately for IAB-DU and IAB-MT.*
Every *TAB connector* of *IAB type 1-H* supporting reception in an
*operating band* shall map to one *TAB connector RX min cell group*,
where mapping of *TAB connectors* to cells/beams is implementation
dependent.

The number of active receiver units that are considered when calculating
the conducted RX spurious emission limits (N~RXU,counted~) for IAB type
1-H is calculated as follows:

> N~RXU,counted~ = *min(N~RXU,active,~ 8* *× N~cells~)*

N~RXU,countedpercell~ is used for scaling of *basic limits* and is
derived as N~RXU,countedpercell~ = *N~RXU,counted~ / N~cells~, where
N~cells~ is defined in clause 6.1.*

> NOTE: N~RXU,active~ is the number of actually active receiver units
> and is independent to the declaration of N~cells~.

### 7.6.2 Minimum requirement

The minimum requirement for *IAB type 1-H*:

> For *IAB-DU* are in TS 38.174 \[2\], clause 7.6.2.
>
> For *IAB-MT* are in TS 38.174 \[2\], clause 7.6.3.

### 7.6.3 Test purpose

The test purpose is to verify the ability of the IAB to limit the
interference caused by receiver spurious emissions to other systems.

### 7.6.4 Method of test

#### 7.6.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: Normal; see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier: M; see clause 4.9.1.

*IAB RF Bandwidth* positions to be tested for multi-carrier:

\- M~RFBW~ in single-band operation, see clause 4.9.1,

\- B~RFBW~\_T\'~RFBW~ and B\'~RFBW~\_T~RFBW~ in multi-band operation,
see clause 4.9.1.

#### 7.6.4.2 Procedure

The minimum requirement is applied to all connectors under test,

For *IAB type 1-H* where there may be multiple *TAB connectors* they may
be tested one at a time or multiple *TAB connectors* may be tested in
parallel as shown in annex D.2.4. Whichever method is used the procedure
is repeated until all *TAB connectors* necessary to demonstrate
conformance have been tested.

1\) Connect the connector under test to measurement equipment as shown
in annex D.2.4 for *IAB type 1-H*.

2\) For TDD connectors capable of transmit and receive ensure the
transmitter is OFF.

3\) For IAB-DU, set the measurement equipment parameters as specified in
table 7.6.5.1-1.

For IAB-MT, set the measurement equipment parameters as specified in
table 7.6.5.3-1.

4\) For IAB-DU, measure the spurious emissions over each frequency range
described in table 7.6.5.1-1.

For IAB-MT, measure the spurious emissions over each frequency range
described in table 7.6.5.3-1.

In addition, for a *multi-band* *connector*, the following steps shall
apply:

5\) For *multi-band* *connector* and single band tests, repeat the steps
above per involved band where single band test configurations and test
models shall apply with no carrier activated in the other band.

### 7.6.5 Test requirements

#### 7.6.5.1 Basic limits for IAB-DU

The receiver spurious emissions limits are provided in table 7.6.5.1-1.

#### 7.6.5.2 Test requirement for IAB-DU

The RX spurious emissions requirements for *IAB type 1-H* are that for
each applicable *basic limit* specified in table 7.6.5.1-1 for each *TAB
connector RX min cell group,* the power sum of emissions at respective
*TAB connectors* shall not exceed the IAB limits specified as the *basic
limit*s + X, where X = 10log~10~(N~RXU,countedpercell~), unless stated
differently in regional regulation.

The RX spurious emission requirements are applied per the *TAB connector
RX min cell group for all the configurations supported by the IAB-DU.*

NOTE: Conformance to the IAB-DU receiver spurious emissions requirement
can be demonstrated by meeting at least one of the following criteria as
determined by the manufacturer:

1\) The sum of the spurious emissions power measured on each *TAB
connector* in the *TAB connector RX min cell group* shall be less than
or equal to the IAB-DU limit above for the respective frequency span.

Or

2\) The spurious emissions power at each *TAB connector* shall be less
than or equal to the IAB-DU limit as defined above for the respective
frequency span, scaled by -10log~10~(*n*), where *n* is the number of
*TAB connectors* in the *TAB connector RX min cell group*.

#### 7.6.5.4 Test requirement for IAB-MT

The RX spurious emissions requirements for *IAB type 1-H* are that for
each applicable *basic limit* specified in table 7.6.5.3-1 for each *TAB
connector RX min cell group,* the power sum of emissions at respective
*TAB connectors* shall not exceed the IAB-MT limits specified as the
*basic limit*s + X, where X = 10log~10~(N~RXU,countedpercell~), unless
stated differently in regional regulation.

The RX spurious emission requirements are applied per the *TAB connector
RX min cell group for all the configurations supported by the IAB-MT.*

NOTE: Conformance to the IAB-MT receiver spurious emissions requirement
can be demonstrated by meeting at least one of the following criteria as
determined by the manufacturer:

1\) The sum of the spurious emissions power measured on each *TAB
connector* in the *TAB connector RX min cell group* shall be less than
or equal to the IAB-MT limit above for the respective frequency span.

Or

2\) The spurious emissions power at each *TAB connector* shall be less
than or equal to the IAB-MT limit as defined above for the respective
frequency span, scaled by -10log~10~(*n*), where *n* is the number of
*TAB connectors* in the *TAB connector RX min cell group*.

7.7 Receiver intermodulation
----------------------------

### 7.7.1 Definition and applicability

Third and higher order mixing of the two interfering RF signals can
produce an interfering signal in the band of the desired channel.
Intermodulation response rejection is a measure of the capability of the
receiver to receive a wanted signal on its assigned channel frequency at
the *TAB connector* for *IAB type 1-H* in the presence of two
interfering signals which have a specific frequency relationship to the
wanted signal.

### 7.7.2 Minimum requirement

The minimum requirement for *IAB type 1-H*:

> For *IAB-DU* are in TS 38.174 \[2\], clause 7.7.2.
>
> For *IAB-MT* are in TS 38.174 \[2\], clause 7.7.3.

### 7.7.3 Test purpose

The test purpose is to verify the ability of the IAB node receiver to
inhibit the generation of intermodulation products in its non-linear
elements caused by the presence of two high-level interfering signals at
frequencies with a specific relationship to the frequency of the wanted
signal.

### 7.7.4 Method of test

#### 7.7.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: Normal; see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier (SC): M; see clause 4.9.1

*IAB RF Bandwidth p*ositions to be tested for multi-carrier (MC) and/or
CA:

> \- M~RFBW~ for *single-band connector(s)*, see clause 4.9.1,
>
> \- B~RFBW~\_T\'~RFBW~ and B\'~RFBW~\_T~RFBW~ for *multi-band
> connector(s),* see clause 4.9.1.

NOTE: When testing in M (or M~RFBW~), if the interferer is fully or
partially located outside the supported frequency range, then the
test shall be done instead in B (or B~RFBW~) and T (or T~RFBW~), and
only with the interferer located inside the supported frequency range.

#### 7.7.4.2 Procedure

The minimum requirement is applied to all connectors under test.

For *IAB type 1-H* the procedure is repeated until all *TAB connectors*
necessary to demonstrate conformance have been tested; see clause 7.1.

1\) Connect the connector under test to measurement equipment as shown
in annex D.2.6 for *IAB type 1-H*.

2\) Set the signal generator for the wanted signal to transmit as
specified in table 7.7.5.1-1 and 7.7.5.1-3 for IAB-DU and table
7.7.5.2-1 and 7.7.5.2-3 for IAB-MT.

3\) Set the signal generator for the interfering signal to transmit at
the frequency offset and as specified in table 7.7.5.1-2 and 7.7.5.1-4
for IAB-DU and table 7.7.5.2-2 and 7.7.5.2-4 for IAB-MT.

4\) Measure the throughput according to annex A.1.

In addition, for a *multi-band* *connector*, the following steps shall
apply:

5\) For *multi-band* *connector* and single band tests, repeat the steps
above per involved band where single band test configurations and test
models shall apply with no carrier activated in the other band.

### 7.7.5 Test requirements 

#### 7.7.5.1 *IAB-DU*

The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference
measurement channel, with a wanted signal at the assigned channel
frequency and two interfering signals coupled to the *IAB type 1-H* *TAB
connector*, with the conditions specified in tables 7.7.5.1-1 and
7.7.5.1-2 for intermodulation performance and in tables 7.7.5.1-3, and
7.7.5.1-4 for narrowband intermodulation performance. The reference
measurement channel for the wanted signal is identified in
tables 7.2.5.1-1 to 7.2.5.1-3 for each channel bandwidth and further
specified in annex A.1. The characteristics of the interfering signal is
further specified in annex E.

The subcarrier spacing for the modulated interfering signal shall in
general be the same as the subcarrier spacing for the wanted signal,
except for the case of wanted signal subcarrier spacing 60 kHz and
*IAB-DU channel bandwidth* \<= 20MHz, for which the subcarrier spacing
of the interfering signal should be 30 kHz.

The receiver intermodulation requirement is applicable outside the
*IAB-DU RF Bandwidth* or Radio Bandwidth edges. The interfering signal
offset is defined relative to the *IAB-DU RF Bandwidth edges* or *Radio
Bandwidth* edges.

For an IAB-DU operating in non-contiguous spectrum within any *operating
band*, the narrowband intermodulation requirement applies in addition
inside any sub-block gap in case the sub-block gap is at least as wide
as the channel bandwidth of the NR interfering signal in table 7.7.5.1-2
or 7.7.5.1-4. The interfering signal offset is defined relative to the
sub-block edges inside the sub-block gap.

For a *multi-band connectors*, the intermodulation requirement applies
in addition inside any *Inter RF Bandwidth gap*, in case the gap size is
at least twice as wide as the NR interfering signal centre frequency
offset from the *IAB-DU RF Bandwidth edge*.

For a *multi-band connectors*, the narrowband intermodulation
requirement applies in addition inside any *Inter RF Bandwidth gap* in
case the gap size is at least as wide as the NR interfering signal in
tables 7.7.5.1-2 and 7.7.5.1-4. The interfering signal offset is defined
relative to the *IAB-DU RF Bandwidth edges* inside the *Inter RF
Bandwidth gap*.

#### 7.7.5.2 *IAB-MT*

The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference
measurement channel, with a wanted signal at the assigned channel
frequency and two interfering signals coupled to the *IAB type 1-H* *TAB
connector*, with the conditions specified in tables 7.7.5.2-1 and
7.7.5.2-2 for intermodulation performance and in tables 7.7.5.2-3, and
7.7.5.2-4 for narrowband intermodulation performance. The reference
measurement channel for the wanted signal is identified in
tables 7.2.5.2-1 to 7.2.5.2-3 for each channel bandwidth and further
specified in annex A.1. The characteristics of the interfering signal is
further specified in annex E.

The subcarrier spacing for the modulated interfering signal shall in
general be the same as the subcarrier spacing for the wanted signal,
except for the case of wanted signal subcarrier spacing 60 kHz and
*IAB-MT channel bandwidth* \<=20MHz, for which the subcarrier spacing of
the interfering signal should be 30 kHz.

The receiver intermodulation requirement is applicable outside the
IAB-MT RF Bandwidth or Radio Bandwidth edges. The interfering signal
offset is defined relative to the *IAB-MT RF Bandwidth edges* or Radio
Bandwidth edges.

For an IAB-MT operating in non-contiguous spectrum within any *operating
band*, the narrowband intermodulation requirement applies in addition
inside any sub-block gap in case the sub-block gap is at least as wide
as the channel bandwidth of the NR interfering signal in table 7.7.5.2-2
or 7.7.5.2-4. The interfering signal offset is defined relative to the
sub-block edges inside the sub-block gap.

For a *multi-band connectors*, the intermodulation requirement applies
in addition inside any *Inter RF Bandwidth gap*, in case the gap size is
at least twice as wide as the NR interfering signal centre frequency
offset from the *IAB-MT RF Bandwidth edge*.

For a *multi-band connectors*, the narrowband intermodulation
requirement applies in addition inside any *Inter RF Bandwidth gap* in
case the gap size is at least as wide as the NR interfering signal in
tables 7.7.5.2-2 and 7.7.5.2-4. The interfering signal offset is defined
relative to the *IAB-MT RF Bandwidth edges* inside the *Inter RF
Bandwidth gap*.

7.8 In-channel selectivity
--------------------------

### 7.8.1 Definition and applicability

In-channel selectivity (ICS) is a measure of the receiver ability to
receive a wanted signal at its assigned resource block locations at the
*TAB connector* for *IAB-DU* in the presence of an interfering signal
received at a larger power spectral density. In this condition a
throughput requirement shall be met for a specified reference
measurement channel. The interfering signal shall be an NR signal which
is time aligned with the wanted signal.

### 7.8.2 Minimum requirement

The minimum requirements for *IAB type 1-H* for *IAB-DU* are in
TS 38.174 \[2\], clause 7.8.2.

### 7.8.3 Test purpose

The purpose of this test is to verify the IAB-DU receiver ability to
suppress the IQ leakage.

### 7.8.4 Method of test

#### 7.8.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: Normal; see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier: M; see clause 4.9.1.

#### 7.8.4.2 Procedure

The minimum requirement is applied to all connectors under test.

For *IAB type 1-H* the procedure is repeated until all *TAB connectors*
necessary to demonstrate conformance have been tested; see clause 7.1.

> 1\) Set the signal generator for the wanted signal to transmit as
> specified in sub-clause 7.8.5.
>
> 2\) Set the signal generator for the interfering signal to transmit at
> the frequency offset and as specified in sub-clause 7.8.5.
>
> 3\) Measure the throughput according to annex A.1.

In addition, for a *multi-band* *connector*, the following steps shall
apply:

> 4\) For *multi-band* *connector* and single band tests, repeat the
> steps above per involved band where single band test configurations
> and test models shall apply with no carrier activated in the other
> band.

### 7.8.5 Test requirements 

#### 7.8.5.1 *IAB-DU*

For *IAB-DU,* the throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of
the reference measurement channel as specified in annex A.1 with
parameters specified in table 7.8.5.1-1 for Wide Area IAB-DU, in table
7.8.5.1-2 for Medium Range IAB-DU and in table 7.8.5.1-3 for Local Area
IAB-DU. The characteristics of the interfering signal is further
specified in annex E.

8 Conducted performance requirements
====================================

8.1 IAB-DU performance requirements
-----------------------------------

### 8.1.1 General

#### 8.1.1.1 Scope and definitions

Conducted performance requirements specify the ability of the *IAB type
1-H* to correctly demodulate signals in various conditions and
configurations. Conducted performance requirements are specified at the
*TAB connector(s)*.

Conducted performance requirements for the IAB-DU are specified for the
fixed reference channels and the propagation conditions defined in
TS 38.174 \[2\] annex A and annex F, respectively. The requirements only
apply to those FRCs that are supported by the IAB-DU.

Unless stated otherwise, performance requirements apply for a single
carrier only. Performance requirements for a IAB-DU supporting CA are
defined in terms of single carrier requirements.

The method of synchronization with the TE is left to implementation.
Neither the use of downlink signal configuration nor the use of
proprietary means is precluded. In tests performed with signal
generators a synchronization signal may be provided between the IAB-DU
and the signal generator, or a common (e.g., GNSS) source may be
provided to both IAB node and the signal generator, to enable correct
timing of the wanted signal.

The SNR used in this clause is specified based on a single carrier and
defined as:

SNR = S / N

Where:

> S is the total signal energy in a slot on a single *TAB connector*.
>
> N is the noise energy in a bandwidth corresponding to the transmission
> bandwidth over the duration of a slot.

#### 8.1.1.2 Applicability rule

##### 8.1.1.2.1 General

Unless otherwise stated, for a IAB-DU supporting more than 8 *TAB
connectors* (see D.37 in table 4.6-1), the performance requirement tests
for 8 RX antennas shall apply, and the specific connectors used for
testing are based on manufacturer declaration.

Unless otherwise stated, for a IAB-DU supporting different numbers of
*TAB connectors* (see D.37 in table 4.6-1), the tests with low MIMO
correlation level shall apply only for the highest numbers of supported
connectors, and the specific connectors used for testing are based on
manufacturer declaration.

##### 8.1.1.2.2 Applicability of PUSCH performance requirements

##### 8.1.1.2.2.1 Applicability of requirements for different subcarrier spacings {#applicability-of-requirements-for-different-subcarrier-spacings .H6}

Unless otherwise stated, PUSCH requirement tests shall apply only for
each subcarrier spacing declared to be supported (see D.14 in table
4.6-1).

Unless otherwise stated, if IAB-DU supports more than one SCS then PUSCH
requirement tests with highest modulation order (see D.109 in table
4.6-1) shall apply only with lowest supported SCS and PUSCH requirement
tests with other modulation orders (see D.109 in table 4.6-1) shall
apply only with highest supported SCS. Otherwise, all modulation orders
are tested on supported SCS.

##### 8.1.1.2.2.2 Applicability of requirements for different channel bandwidths {#applicability-of-requirements-for-different-channel-bandwidths .H6}

For each subcarrier spacing declared to be supported, the test
requirements for a specific channel bandwidth shall apply only if the
IAB-DU supports it (see D.14 in table 4.6-1).

Unless otherwise stated, for each subcarrier spacing declared to be
supported, the tests shall be done only for the widest supported channel
bandwidth. If performance requirement is not specified for this widest
supported channel bandwidth, the tests shall be done by using
performance requirement for the closest channel bandwidth lower than
this widest supported bandwidth; the tested PRBs shall then be centred
in this widest supported channel bandwidth.

##### 8.1.1.2.2.3 Applicability of requirements for different configurations {#applicability-of-requirements-for-different-configurations .H6}

Unless otherwise stated, PUSCH requirement tests shall apply only for
the mapping type declared to be supported (see D.100 in table 4.6-1). If
both mapping type A and type B are declared to be supported, the tests
shall be done for either type A or type B; the same chosen mapping type
shall then be used for all tests except the requirement for PUSCH
mapping Type B with 2 symbol length allocated.

##### 8.1.1.2.2.4 Applicability of requirements for uplink carrier aggregation {#applicability-of-requirements-for-uplink-carrier-aggregation .H6}

The tests for uplink carrier aggregation shall be carried out according
to the declaration (see D.107 in table 4.6-1).

Unless otherwise stated, the tests for uplink carrier aggregation shall
apply only for PUSCH with transform precoding disabled and shall be
conducted on per component carrier basis.

##### 8.1.1.2.2.5 Applicability of requirements for TDD with different UL-DL patterns {#applicability-of-requirements-for-tdd-with-different-ul-dl-patterns .H6}

Unless otherwise stated, for each subcarrier spacing declared to be
supported, if IAB-DU supports multiple TDD UL-DL patterns, only one of
the supported TDD UL-DL patterns shall be used for all tests.

##### 8.1.1.2.2.6 Applicability of requirements for transform precoding {#applicability-of-requirements-for-transform-precoding .H6}

Unless otherwise stated, the tests with transform precoding enabled
shall apply only, if the IAB-DU supports it (see D.109 in table 4.6-1).

##### 8.1.1.2.3 Applicability of PUCCH performance requirements

##### 8.1.1.2.3.1 Applicability of requirements for different formats {#applicability-of-requirements-for-different-formats .H6}

Unless otherwise stated, PUCCH requirement tests shall apply only for
each PUCCH format declared to be supported (see D.102 in table 4.6-1).

##### 8.1.1.2.3.2 Applicability of requirements for different subcarrier spacings {#applicability-of-requirements-for-different-subcarrier-spacings-1 .H6}

Unless otherwise stated, PUCCH requirement tests shall apply only for
each subcarrier spacing declared to be supported (see D.14 in table
4.6-1). If multiple subcarrier spacings are declared to be supported,
each supported PUCCH format can be tested on one subcarrier spacing.

##### 8.1.1.2.3.3 Applicability of requirements for different channel bandwidths {#applicability-of-requirements-for-different-channel-bandwidths-1 .H6}

For each subcarrier spacing declared to be supported by the IAB-DU, the
test requirements for a specific channel bandwidth shall apply only if
the IAB-DU supports it (see D.14 in table 4.6-1).

Unless otherwise stated, for each subcarrier spacing declared to be
supported, the tests shall be done only for the widest supported channel
bandwidth. If performance requirement is not specified for this widest
supported channel bandwidth, the tests shall be done by using
performance requirement for the closest channel bandwidth lower than
this widest supported bandwidth; the tested PRIAB-DU shall then be
centred in this widest supported channel bandwidth.

##### 8.1.1.2.3.4 Applicability of requirements for different configurations {#applicability-of-requirements-for-different-configurations-1 .H6}

Unless otherwise stated, PUCCH format 3 requirement tests shall apply
only for the additional DM-RS configuration declared to be supported
(see D.104 in table 4.6-1). If both options (without and with additional
DM-RS) are declared to be supported, the tests shall be done for either
without or with additional DM-RS; the same chosen option shall then be
used for all tests.

Unless otherwise stated, PUCCH format 4 requirement tests shall apply
only for the additional DM-RS configuration declared to be supported
(see D.105 in table 4.6-1). If both options (without and with additional
DM-RS) are declared to be supported, the tests shall be done for either
without or with additional DM-RS; the same chosen option shall then be
used for all tests.

##### 8.1.1.2.3.5 Applicability of requirements for multi-slot PUCCH {#applicability-of-requirements-for-multi-slot-pucch .H6}

Unless otherwise stated, multi-slot PUCCH requirement tests shall apply
only if the IAB-DU supports it (see D.106 in table 4.6-1).

##### 8.1.1.2.4 Applicability of PRACH performance requirements 

##### 8.1.1.2.4.1 Applicability of requirements for different formats {#applicability-of-requirements-for-different-formats-1 .H6}

Unless otherwise stated, PRACH requirement tests shall apply only for
PRACH formats declared to be supported (see D.103 in table 4.6-1).

For IAB-DU declares to support more than one PRACH formats, limit the
number of tests to any two cases chosen by the manufacturer. If IAB-DU
declares to support more than one PRACH formats where formats for both
long and short PRACH sequences are presented, require choosing formats
with different sequences (see D.103 in table 4.6-1).

##### 8.1.1.2.4.2 Applicability of requirements for different subcarrier spacings {#applicability-of-requirements-for-different-subcarrier-spacings-2 .H6}

Unless otherwise stated, for each PRACH format with short sequence
declared to be supported, for each FR, the tests shall apply only for
the smallest supported subcarrier spacing in the FR (see D.103 in table
4.6-1).

##### 8.1.1.2.4.3 Applicability of requirements for different channel bandwidths {#applicability-of-requirements-for-different-channel-bandwidths-2 .H6}

Unless otherwise stated, for the subcarrier spacing to be tested, the
test requirements shall apply only for anyone channel bandwidth declared
to be supported (see D.14 in table 4.6-1).

### 8.1.2 Performance requirements for PUSCH

#### 8.1.2.1 Performance requirements for PUSCH with transform precoding disabled

##### 8.1.2.1.1 Definition and applicability

The performance requirement of PUSCH is determined by a minimum required
throughput for a given SNR. The required throughput is expressed as a
fraction of maximum throughput for the FRCs listed in annex A. The
performance requirements assume HARQ re-transmissions.

Which specific test(s) are applicable to IAB-DU is based on the test
applicability rules defined in clause 8.1.1.2.2.

##### 8.1.2.1.2 Minimum requirement

The minimum requirement is in TS 38.174 \[2\] clause 8.1.2.1.

##### 8.1.2.1.3 Test purpose

The test shall verify the receiver\'s ability to achieve throughput
under multipath fading propagation conditions for a given SNR.

##### 8.1.2.1.4 Method of test

##### 8.1.2.1.4.1 Initial conditions {#initial-conditions-19 .H6}

Test environment: Normal, see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier: M; see clause 4.9.1.

RF channels to be tested for carrier aggregation: M~BW\ Channel\ CA~;
see clause 4.9.1.

##### 8.1.2.1.4.2 Test procedure {#test-procedure .H6}

1\) Connect the IAB-DU tester generating the wanted signal, multipath
fading simulators and AWGN generators to all IAB-DU *TAB connectors* for
diversity reception via a combining network as shown in annex D. 3.

2\) Adjust the AWGN generator, according to the channel bandwidth,
defined in table 8.1.2.1.4.2-1.

#### 8.1.2.2 Performance requirements for PUSCH with transform precoding enabled

##### 8.1.2.2.1 Definition and applicability

The performance requirement of PUSCH is determined by a minimum required
throughput for a given SNR. The required throughput is expressed as a
fraction of maximum throughput for the FRCs listed in annex A. The
performance requirements assume HARQ re-transmissions.

Which specific test(s) are applicable to IAB-DU is based on the test
applicability rules defined in clause 8.1.1.2.2.

##### 8.1.2.2.2 Minimum requirement

The minimum requirement is in TS 38.174 \[2\], clause 8.1.2.2.

##### 8.1.2.2.3 Test purpose

#### 8.1.2.3 Performance requirements for UCI multiplexed on PUSCH

##### 8.1.2.3.1 Definition and applicability

The performance requirement of UCI multiplexed on PUSCH is determined by
two parameters: block error probability (BLER) of CSI part 1 and block
error probability of CSI part 2. The performance is measured by the
required SNR at block error probability of CSI part 1 not exceeding 0.1
%, and the required SNR at block error probability of CSI part 2 not
exceeding 1 %.

The CSI part 1 BLER is defined as the probability of incorrectly
decoding the CSI part 1 information when the CSI part 1 information is
sent.

The CSI part 2 BLER is defined as the probability of incorrectly
decoding the CSI part 2 information when the CSI part 2 information is
sent.

In the test of UCI multiplexed on PUSCH, the UCI information only
contains CSI part 1 and CSI part 2 information, there is no HACK/ACK
information transmitted.

The number of UCI information bit payload per slot is defined for two
cases as follows:

\- 7 bits: 5 bits in CSI part 1, 2 bits in CSI part 2,

\- 40 bits: 20 bits in CSI part 1, 20 bits in CSI part 2.

The 7 bits UCI information case is further defined with the bitmap \[c0
c1 c2 c3 c4\] = \[0 1 0 1 0\] for CSI part 1 information, where c0 is
mapping to the RI information, and with the bitmap \[c0 c1\] = \[1 0\]
for CSI part 2 information.

The 40 bits UCI information case is assumed random information bit
selection.

In both tests, PUSCH data, CSI part 1 and CSI part 2 are transmitted
simultaneously.

Which specific test(s) is applicable to IAB-DU is based on the test
applicability rule defined in clause 8.1.1.2.2.

##### 8.1.2.3.2 Minimum requirement

The minimum requirements are in TS 38.174 \[2\] clause 8.1.2.3.

##### 8.1.2.3.3 Test purpose

The test shall verify the receiver\'s ability to detect UCI with CSI
part 1 and CSI part 2 bits multiplexed on PUSCH under multipath fading
propagation conditions for a given SNR.

##### 8.1.2.3.4 Method of test

##### 8.1.2.3.4.1 Initial conditions {#initial-conditions-21 .H6}

Test environment: Normal, see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier: M; see clause 4.9.1.

##### 8.1.2.3.4.2 Test procedure {#test-procedure-2 .H6}

1\) Connect the IAB-DU tester generating the wanted signal, multipath
fading simulators and AWGN generators to all IAB-DU *TAB connectors* for
diversity reception via a combining network as shown in annex D. 3.

2\) Adjust the AWGN generator, according to combination of SCS and
channel bandwidth defined in table 8.1.2.3.4.2-1.

  ------------------------------- ----------------------------- ----------------------

3\) The characteristics of the wanted signal shall be configured
according to the corresponding UL reference measurement channel defined
in annex A and the specific test parameters are configured as below. The
UCI information bit payload per slot is equal to 7 bits with CSI part 1
5bits, CSI part 2 2bit; and the UCI information bit payload per slot is
equal to 40 bits with CSI part 1 20bits, CSI part 2 20bits.

### 8.1.3 Performance requirements for PUCCH

#### 8.1.3.1 Performance requirements for PUCCH format 0

##### 8.1.3.1.1 Definition and applicability

The performance requirement of single user PUCCH format 0 for ACK missed
detection is determined by the two parameters: probability of false
detection of the ACK and the probability of detection of ACK. The
performance is measured by the required SNR at probability of detection
equal to 0.99. The probability of false detection of the ACK shall be
0.01 or less.

The probability of false detection of the ACK is defined as a
conditional probability of erroneous detection of the ACK when input is
only noise.

The probability of detection of ACK is defined as conditional
probability of detection of the ACK when the signal is present.

The transient period as specified in TS 38.101-1 \[23\] clause 6.3.3.1
is not taken into account for performance requirement testing, where the
RB hopping is symmetric to the CC centre, i.e. intra-slot frequency
hopping is enabled.

Which specific test(s) are applicable to IAB-DU is based on the test
applicability rules defined in clause 8.1.1.2.3.

##### 8.1.3.1.2 Minimum requirement

The minimum requirements are in TS 38.174 \[2\] clause 8.1.3.2.

##### 8.1.3.1.3 Test purpose

The test shall verify the receiver\'s ability to detect ACK under
multipath fading propagation conditions for a given SNR.

##### 8.1.3.1.4 Method of test

##### 8.1.3.1.4.1 Initial conditions {#initial-conditions-22 .H6}

Test environment: Normal, see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested: single carrier M; see clause 4.9.1.

##### 8.1.3.1.4.2 Test procedure {#test-procedure-3 .H6}

1\) Connect the IAB-DU tester generating the wanted signal, multipath
fading simulators and AWGN generators to all IAB-DU *TAB connectors* for
diversity reception via a combining network as shown in annex D. 3.

2\) Adjust the AWGN generator, according to the channel bandwidth and
sub-carrier spacing defined in table 8.1.3.1.4.2-1.

#### 8.1.3.2 Performance requirements for PUCCH format 1

##### 8.1.3.2.1 NACK to ACK detection

##### 8.1.3.2.1.1 Definition and applicability {#definition-and-applicability-26 .H6}

The performance requirement of PUCCH format 1 for NACK to ACK detection
is determined by the two parameters: probability of false detection of
the ACK and the NACK to ACK detection probability. The performance is
measured by the required SNR at probability of the NACK to ACK detection
equal to 0.1% or less. The probability of false detection of the ACK
shall be 0.01 or less.

The probability of false detection of the ACK is defined as a
conditional probability of erroneous detection of the ACK at particular
bit position when input is only noise. Each false bit detection is
counted as one error.

The NACK to ACK detection probability is the probability of detecting an
ACK bit when an NACK bit was sent on particular bit position. Each NACK
bit erroneously detected as ACK bit is counted as one error. Erroneously
detected NACK bits in the definition do not contain the NACK bits which
are mapped from DTX, i.e. NACK bits received when DTX is sent should not
be considered.

The transient period as specified in TS 38.101-1 \[23\] clause 6.3.3.1
is not taken into account for performance requirement testing, where the
RB hopping is symmetric to the CC centre, i.e. intra-slot frequency
hopping is enabled.

Which specific test(s) are applicable to IAB-DU is based on the test
applicability rules defined in clause 8.1.1.2.3.

##### 8.1.3.2.1.2 Minimum requirement {#minimum-requirement-28 .H6}

bits as ACK bits under multipath fading propagation conditions for a
given SNR.

#### 8.1.3.5 Performance requirements for PUCCH format 4

##### 8.1.3.5.1 Definition and applicability

The performance is measured by the required SNR at UCI block error
probability not exceeding 1%.

The UCI block error probability is defined as the conditional
probability of incorrectly decoding the UCI information when the UCI
information is sent. The UCI information does not contain CSI part 2.

The transient period as specified in TS 38.101-1 \[23\] clause 6.3.3.1
is not taken into account for performance requirement testing, where the
RB hopping is symmetric to the CC centre, i.e. intra-slot frequency
hopping is enabled.

Which specific test(s) are applicable to IAB-DU is based on the test
applicability rules defined in clause 8.1.1.2.3.

##### 8.1.3.5.2 Minimum requirement

The minimum requirement is in TS 38.104 \[11\] clause 8.1.3.6.

##### 8.1.3.6.1.1.1 Definition and applicability {#definition-and-applicability-32 .H6}

The performance requirement of multi-slot PUCCH format 1 for NACK to ACK
detection is determined by the two parameters: probability of false
detection of the ACK and the NACK to ACK detection probability. The
performance is measured by the required SNR at probability of the NACK
to ACK detection equal to 0.1 % or less. The probability of false
detection of the ACK shall be 0.01 % or less.

The probability of false detection of the ACK is defined as a
conditional probability of erroneous detection of the ACK at particular
bit position when input is only noise. Each false bit detection is
counted as one error.

The NACK to ACK detection probability is the probability of detecting an
ACK bit when an NACK bit was sent on particular bit position. Each NACK
bit erroneously detected as ACK bit is counted as one error. Erroneously
detected NACK bits in the definition do not contain the NACK bits which
are mapped from DTX, i.e. NACK bits received when DTX is sent should not
be considered.

Which specific test(s) are applicable to IAB-DU is based on the test
applicability rules defined in clause 8.1.1.2.3.

### 8.1.4 Performance requirements for PRACH

#### 8.1.4.1 PRACH false alarm probability and missed detection requirements

##### 8.1.4.1.1 Definition and applicability

The performance requirement of PRACH for preamble detection is
determined by the two parameters: total probability of false detection
of the preamble (Pfa) and the probability of detection of preamble (Pd).
The performance is measured by the required SNR at probability of
detection, Pd of 99%. Pfa shall be 0.1% or less.

Pfa is defined as a conditional total probability of erroneous detection
of the preamble (i.e. erroneous detection from any detector) when input
is only noise.

Pd is defined as conditional probability of detection of the preamble
when the signal is present. The erroneous detection consists of several
error cases -- detecting only different preamble(s) than the one that
was sent, not detecting any preamble at all, or detecting the correct
preamble but with the out-of-bounds timing estimation value.

For AWGN and TDLC300-100, a timing estimation error occurs if the
estimation error of the timing of the strongest path is larger than the
time error tolerance values given in table 8.1.4.1.1-1.

Table 8.1.4.1.1-1: Time error tolerance for AWGN and TDLC300-100

  ----------------- ----------- ---------------------- -------------
  PRACH             PRACH SCS   Time error tolerance

  ----------------- ----------- ---------------------- -------------

The test preambles for normal mode are listed in A.2.5-1.

Which specific test(s) are applicable to IAB-DU is based on the test
applicability rules defined in clause 8.1.1.2.4.

8.2 IAB-MT Performance requirements
-----------------------------------

### 8.2.1 General

#### 8.2.1.1 Scope and definitions

Conducted performance requirements specify the ability of the IAB-MT to
correctly demodulate signals in various conditions and configurations.
Conducted performance requirements are specified at the TAB
connector(s).

Conducted performance requirements for the IAB-MT are specified for the
fixed reference channels and the propagation conditions defined in
TS 38.174 \[2\] annex A and annex F, respectively. The requirements only
apply to those FRCs that are supported by the IAB-MT.

Unless stated otherwise, performance requirements apply for a single
carrier only. Performance requirements for an IAB-MT supporting CA are
defined in terms of single carrier requirements.

The SNR used in this clause is specified based on a single carrier and
defined as:

SNR = S / N

Where:

S is the total signal energy in a slot on a single *TAB connector*.

N is the noise energy in a bandwidth corresponding to the transmission
bandwidth over the duration of a slot.

### 8.2.2 Demodulation performance requirements

#### 8.2.2.1 General

##### 8.2.2.1.1 Applicability of requirements

##### 8.2.2.1.1.1 General {#general-25 .H6}

Unless otherwise stated, for a IAB-MT declared to support more than 2
demodulation branches (for *IAB-MT type 1-O* and *IAB-MT type 2-O*), the
performance requirement tests for 2 demodulation branches shall apply,
and the mapping between connectors and demodulation branches is up to
IAB-MT implementation.

The tests requiring more than \[20\] dB SNR level are set to N/A in the
test requirements.

##### 8.2.2.1.1.2 Applicability of requirements for different subcarrier spacings {#applicability-of-requirements-for-different-subcarrier-spacings-3 .H6}

Unless otherwise stated, the tests shall apply only for each subcarrier
spacing declared to be supported (see D.7 in table 4.6-1).

##### 8.2.2.1.1.3 Applicability of requirements for TDD with different UL-DL patterns {#applicability-of-requirements-for-tdd-with-different-ul-dl-patterns-1 .H6}

Unless otherwise stated, for each subcarrier spacing declared to be
supported, if IAB-MT supports multiple TDD UL-DL patterns, only one of
the supported TDD UL-DL patterns shall be used for all tests.

##### 8.2.2.1.1.4 Applicability of requirements for IAB-MT features {#applicability-of-requirements-for-iab-mt-features .H6}

Unless otherwise stated, the PDSCH 256QAM tests (Test 1-1 of Clause
8.2.2.2.5) shall apply only if 256QAM for PDSCH for FR1 is declared to
be supported (see D.200 in table 4.6-1, *pdsch-256QAM-FR1*).

Unless otherwise stated, the PDSCH tests (Tests 4, 5 of clause
8.2.2.2.5) shall apply only in case the number of NZP-CSI-RS ports in
the test case satisfies maximum number of ports across all configured
NZP-CSI-RS resources per CC declared to be supported (see D.201 in table
4.6-1, *maxConfigNumberPortsAcrossNZP-CSI-RS-PerCC*).

Unless otherwise stated, the PDSCH tests (Tests 3, 4, 5 of clause
8.2.2.2.5) shall apply only in case the PDSCH MIMO rank in the test case
does not exceed the maximum number of PDSCH MIMO layers declared to be
supported (see D.202 in table 4.6-1,
*maxConfigNumberPortsAcrossNZP-CSI-RS-PerCC*).

NOTE: Applicability information may be obtained based on vendor
declaration (Section 4.6) or alternatively from reading capability
signaling.

#### 8.2.2.2 Performance requirements for PDSCH

##### 8.2.2.2.1 Definition and applicability

The performance requirement of PDSCH is determined by a minimum required
throughput for a given SNR. The required throughput is expressed as a
fraction of maximum throughput for the FRCs listed in annex A. The
performance requirements assume HARQ re-transmissions.

##### 8.2.2.2.2 Minimum requirement

The minimum requirement is in TS 38.174 \[2\] clause 8.2.2.1.2.

##### 8.2.2.2.3 Test purpose

The test shall verify the receiver\'s ability to achieve throughput
under multipath fading propagation conditions for a given SNR.

### 8.2.3 CSI reporting requirements

#### 8.2.3.1 General

##### 8.2.3.1.1 Applicability rule for IAB-MT

###### 8.2.3.1.1.1 General

Unless otherwise stated, for an IAB-MT declared to support more than 4
*TAB connectors* (for *IAB type 1-H*), the performance requirement tests
for 4 RX antennas shall apply, and the specific connectors used for
testing is up to IAB-MT implementation.

Testing of performance requirements for RI and PMI reporting is
optional.

###### 8.2.3.1.1.2 Applicability of requirements for different subcarrier spacings

Unless otherwise stated, the tests shall apply only for each subcarrier
spacing declared to be supported (see D.14 in table 4.6-1).

###### 8.2.3.1.1.3 Applicability of requirements for TDD with different UL-DL patterns

Unless otherwise stated, for each subcarrier spacing declared to be
supported, if IAB-MT supports multiple TDD UL-DL patterns, only one of
the supported TDD UL-DL patterns shall be used for all tests.

###### 8.2.3.1.1.4 Applicability of requirements for IAB-MT features

Unless otherwise stated, for *IAB type 1-H*, the CSI reporting tests
shall apply only in case the number of NZP-CSI-RS ports in the test case
satisfies maximum number of ports across all configured NZP-CSI-RS
resources per CC declared to be supported (see D.201 in table 4.6-1*,
maxConfigNumberPortsAcrossNZP-CSI-RS-PerCC*).

Unless otherwise stated, for *IAB type 1-H*, the CSI reporting tests
shall apply only in case the PDSCH MIMO rank in the test case does not
exceed the maximum number of PDSCH MIMO layers declared to be supported
(see D.202 in table 4.6-1*, maxNumberMIMO-LayersPDSCH*).

Note: Applicability information may be obtained based on vendor
declaration (Section 4.6) or alternatively from reading capability
signaling.

#### 8.2.3.2 Reporting Channel Quality Indicator (CQI)

##### 8.2.3.2.1 Definition and applicability

The reporting accuracy of the channel quality indicator (CQI) under
frequency non-selective conditions is determined by the reporting
variance and the BLER performance using the transport format indicated
by the reported CQI median. The purpose is to verify that the reported
CQI values are in accordance with the CQI definition given in TS 38.214
\[24\]. To account for sensitivity of the input SNR the reporting
definition is considered to be verified if the reporting accuracy is met
for at least one of two SNR levels separated by an offset of 1 dB.

Which specific test(s) are applicable to IAB-MT is based on the test
applicability rules defined in clause 8.2.1.2.

##### 8.2.3.2.2 Minimum requirement

The minimum requirement is in TS 38.174 \[2\] clause 8.2.3.1.

##### 8.2.3.2.3 Test purpose

The test shall verify the receiver\'s ability to report CQI values
accordance with the CQI definition given in TS 38.214 \[24\].

##### 8.2.3.2.4 Method of test

##### 8.2.3.2.4.1 Initial conditions {#initial-conditions-34 .H6}

Test environment: Normal, see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier: M; see clause 4.9.1.

##### 8.2.3.2.4.2 Test procedure {#test-procedure-13 .H6}

1\) Connect the IAB-MT tester generating the wanted signal and AWGN
generators to all IAB-MT *TAB* connectors for diversity reception via a
combining network as shown in annex D.5 and D.6.

2\) Adjust the AWGN generator, according to the channel bandwidth,
defined in table 8.2.3.2.4.2-1.

Table 8.2.3.2.4.2-1: AWGN power level at the IAB-MT input

  Sub-carrier spacing (kHz)   Channel bandwidth (MHz)   AWGN power level

4\) Adjust the equipment so that required SNR specified in table
8.2.3.2.4.2-2 is achieved at the IAB-MT input.

5\) For each test specified in table 8.2.3.2.4.2-2 applicable for the
IAB-MT, measure the median CQI and the BLER at median CQI and (median
CQI+1 or median CQI-1) as per clause 8.2.3.2.5.

##### 8.2.3.2.5 Test requirement

For the parameters specified in Table 8.2.3.2.4.2-2, and using the
downlink physical channels specified in Annex A, the test requirements
are specified by the following:

> a\) The reported CQI value according to the reference channel shall be
> in the range of ±1 of the reported median more than 90% of the time.
>
> b\) If the PDSCH BLER using the transport format indicated by median
> CQI is less than or equal to 0.1, then the BLER using the transport
> format indicated by the (median CQI+1) shall be greater than 0.1. If
> the PDSCH BLER using the transport format indicated by the median CQI
> is greater than 0.1, then the BLER using transport format indicated by
> (median CQI-1) shall be less than or equal to 0.1.

#### 8.2.3.3 Reporting of Precoding Matrix Indicator (PMI)

##### 8.2.3.3.1 Definition and applicability

The minimum performance requirements of PMI reporting are defined based
on the precoding gain, expressed as the relative increase in throughput
when the transmitter is configured according to the IAB-MT reported PMI
compared to the case when the transmitter is using random precoding,
respectively. When the transmitter uses random precoding, for each PDSCH
allocation a precoder is randomly generated with equal probability of
each applicable i~1~ and i~2~ combination and applied to the PDSCH. A
fixed transport format (FRC) is configured for all requirements.

The requirements for transmission mode 1 with higher layer parameter
*codebookType* set to \'typeI-SinglePanel\' are specified in terms of
the ratio:

In the definition of *γ*, for 4TX and 8TX PMI requirements, is 90 % of
the maximum throughput obtained at using the precoders configured
according to the IAB-MT reports, and is the throughput measured at with
random precoding.

##### 8.2.3.3.2 Minimum requirement

The minimum requirement is in TS 38.174 \[2\] clause 8.2.3.2.

##### 8.2.3.3.3 Test purpose

The test shall verify the receiver\'s ability to achieve throughput gain
under multipath fading propagation conditions using reporting PMI
comparing to using random PMI.

##### 8.2.3.3.4 Method of test

##### 8.2.3.3.4.1 Initial conditions {#initial-conditions-35 .H6}

Test environment: Normal, see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier: M; see clause 4.9.1.

##### 8.2.3.3.4.2 Test procedure {#test-procedure-14 .H6}

1\) Connect the IAB-MT tester generating the wanted signal and AWGN
generators to all IAB-MT *TAB* connectors for diversity reception via a
combining network as shown in annex D.5 and D.6.

2\) Adjust the AWGN generator, according to the channel bandwidth,
defined in table 8.2.3.3.4.2-1.

##### 8.2.3.4.1 General

The purpose of this test is to verify that the reported rank indicator
accurately represents the channel rank. The accuracy of RI reporting is
determined by the relative increase of the throughput obtained when
transmitting based on the reported rank compared to the case for which a
fixed rank is used for transmission.

##### 8.2.3.4.2 Minimum requirements

The minimum requirement is in TS 38.174 \[2\] clause 8.2.3.3.

##### 8.2.3.4.3 Test purpose

The test shall verify the receiver\'s ability to report rank indicator
accurately represents the channel rank.

corresponding channel model defined in annex F.

5\) Adjust the equipment so that required SNR specified in Table
8.2.3.4.4.2-2 is achieved at the IAB-MT input.

6\) For each test specified in table 8.2.3.4.4.2-2 applicable for the
IAB-MT, calculate *γ*.

##### 8.2.3.4.5 Test requirement

The test requirement for RI reporting is defined as

a\) The ratio of the throughput obtained when transmitting based on
IAB-MT reported RI and that obtained when transmitting with fixed rank 1
shall be ≥ γ~1~;

b\) The ratio of the throughput obtained when transmitting based on
IAB-MT reported RI and that obtained when transmitting with fixed rank 2
shall be ≥ γ~2~;

For the parameters specified in Table 8.2.3.4.4.2-2 and using the
downlink physical channels specified in Annex A, the test requirements
are specified in Table 8.2.3.4.5-1.

######## Annex B (normative): Environmental requirements for the IAB equipment

B.1 General
===========

For each test in the present document, the environmental conditions
under which the IAB is to be tested are defined.

B.2 Normal test environment
===========================

When a normal test environment is specified for a test, the test should
be performed within the minimum and maximum limits of the conditions
stated in table B.1.

**Table B.1: Limits of conditions for normal test environment**

  Condition             Minimum                                    Maximum
  --------------------- ------------------------------------------ ---------
  Barometric pressure   86 kPa                                     106 kPa
  Temperature           15 °C                                      30 °C
  Relative humidity     20 %                                       85 %
  Power supply          Nominal, as declared by the manufacturer   
  Vibration             Negligible                                 

The ranges of barometric pressure, temperature and humidity represent
the maximum variation expected in the uncontrolled environment of a test
laboratory. If it is not possible to maintain these parameters within
the specified limits, the actual values shall be recorded in the test
report.

NOTE: This may, for instance, be the case for measurements of radiated
emissions performed on an open field test site.

B.3 Extreme test environment
============================

B.3.1 General
-------------

The manufacturer shall declare one of the following:

1\) The equipment class for the equipment under test, as defined in the
IEC 60 721-3-3 \[17\].

2\) The equipment class for the equipment under test, as defined in the
IEC 60 721-3-4 \[18\].

3\) The equipment that does not comply with the mentioned classes, the
relevant classes from IEC 60 721 \[19\] documentation for temperature,
humidity and vibration shall be declared.

> NOTE: Reduced functionality for conditions that fall outside of the
> standard operational conditions is not tested in the present document.
> These may be stated and tested separately.

B.3.2 Extreme temperature
-------------------------

When an extreme temperature test environment is specified for a test,
the test shall be performed at the standard minimum and maximum
operating temperatures defined by the manufacturer\'s declaration for
the equipment under test.

**Minimum temperature:**

The test shall be performed with the environment test equipment and
methods including the required environmental phenomena into the
equipment, conforming to the test procedure of IEC 60 068-2-1 \[20\].

**Maximum temperature:**

The test shall be performed with the environmental test equipment and
methods including the required environmental phenomena into the
equipment, conforming to the test procedure of IEC 60 068-2-2 \[21\].

NOTE: It is recommended that the equipment is made fully operational
prior to the equipment being taken to its lower operating temperature.

B.4 Vibration
=============

When vibration conditions are specified for a test, the test shall be
performed while the equipment is subjected to a vibration sequence as
defined by the manufacturer\'s declaration for the equipment under test.
This shall use the environmental test equipment and methods of inducing
the required environmental phenomena in to the equipment, conforming to
the test procedure of IEC 60 068-2-6 \[22\]. Other environmental
conditions shall be within the ranges specified in annex B.2.

NOTE: The higher levels of vibration may induce undue physical stress in
to equipment after a prolonged series of tests. The testing body should
only vibrate the equipment during the RF measurement process.

B.5 Power supply
================

When extreme power supply conditions are specified for a test, the test
shall be performed at the standard upper and lower limits of operating
voltage defined by manufacturer\'s declaration for the equipment under
test.

**Upper voltage limit:**

The equipment shall be supplied with a voltage equal to the upper limit
declared by the manufacturer (as measured at the input terminals to the
equipment). The tests shall be carried out at the steady state minimum
and maximum temperature limits declared by the manufacturer for the
equipment, to the methods described in IEC 60 068-2-1 \[20\] Test Ab/Ad
and IEC 60 068-2-2 \[21\] Test Bb/Bd: Dry heat.

**Lower voltage limit:**

The equipment shall be supplied with a voltage equal to the lower limit
declared by the manufacturer (as measured at the input terminals to the
equipment). The tests shall be carried out at the steady state minimum
and maximum temperature limits declared by the manufacturer for the
equipment, to the methods described in IEC 60 068-2-1 \[20\] Test Ab/Ad
and IEC 60 068-2-2 \[21\] Test Bb/Bd: Dry heat.

B.6 Measurement of test environments
====================================

The measurement accuracy of the IAB test environments defined in annex B
shall be:

Pressure: ±5 kPa

Temperature: ±2 degrees

Relative humidity: ±5 %

DC voltage: ±1.0 %

AC voltage: ±1.5 %

Vibration: 10 %

Vibration frequency: 0.1 Hz

The above values shall apply unless the test environment is otherwise
controlled and the specification for the control of the test environment
specifies the uncertainty for the parameter.

######## Annex F (normative): Propagation conditions

F.1 Static propagation condition
================================

The propagation for the static performance measurement is an Additive
White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) environment. No fading or multi-paths exist
for this propagation model.

F1.1 IAB-MT receiver with 2RX
-----------------------------

For 1 port transmission the channel matrix is defined in the frequency
domain by:

![](media/image46.wmf){width="0.5083333333333333in" height="0.45in"}.

For 2 port transmission the channel matrix is defined in the frequency
domain by:

![](media/image47.wmf){width="0.825in" height="0.45in"}.

For 4 port transmission the channel matrix is defined in the frequency
domain by:

For 8 port transmission the channel matrix is defined in the frequency
domain by:

![](media/image49.wmf){width="1.6in" height="0.45in"}

F.2 Multi-path fading propagation conditions
============================================

F.2.1 General
-------------

The multipath propagation conditions consist of several parts:

\- A delay profile in the form of a \"tapped delay-line\", characterized
by a number of taps at fixed positions on a sampling grid. The profile
can be further characterized by the r.m.s. delay spread and the maximum
delay spanned by the taps.

\- A combination of channel model parameters that include the Delay
profile and the Doppler spectrum that is characterized by a classical
spectrum shape and a maximum Doppler frequency.

\- Different models are used for FR1 (410 MHz - 7.125 GHz) and FR2
(24.25 GHz -- 52.6 GHz).

F.2.2 Delay profiles
--------------------

### F.2.2.1 General

The delay profiles are simplified from the TR 38.901 \[25\] TDL models.
The simplification steps are shown below for information. These steps
are only used when new delay profiles are created. Otherwise, the delay
profiles specified in F.2.2.1 can be used as such.

\- Step 1: Use the original TDL model from TR 38.901 \[25\].

\- Step 2: Re-order the taps in ascending delays.

\- Step 3: Perform delay scaling according to the procedure described in
clause 7.7.3 in TR 38.901 \[25\].

\- Step 4: Apply the quantization to the delay resolution 5 ns. This is
done simply by rounding the tap delays to the nearest multiple of the
delay resolution.

\- Step 5: If multiple taps are rounded to the same delay bin, merge
them by calculating their linear power sum.

\- Step 6: If there are more than 12 taps in the quantized model, merge
the taps as follows:

\- Find the weakest tap from all taps (both merged and unmerged taps are
considered):

\- If there are two or more taps having the same value and are the
weakest, select the tap with the smallest delay as the weakest tap.

\- When the weakest tap is the first delay tap, merge taps as follows:

\- Update the power of the first delay tap as the linear power sum of
the weakest tap and the second delay tap.

\- Remove the second delay tap.

\- When the weakest tap is the last delay tap, merge taps as follows:

\- Update the power of the last delay tap as the linear power sum of the
second-to-last tap and the last tap.

\- Remove the second-to-last tap.

\- Otherwise:

\- For each side of the weakest tap, identify the neighbour tap that has
the smaller delay difference to the weakest tap.

\- When the delay difference between the weakest tap and the identified
neighbour tap on one side equals the delay difference between the
weakest tap and the identified neighbour tap on the other side.

\- Select the neighbour tap that is weaker in power for merging.

\- Otherwise, select the neighbour tap that has smaller delay difference
for merging.- To merge, the power of the merged tap is the linear sum of
the power of the weakest tap and the selected tap:

\- When the selected tap is the first tap, the location of the merged
tap is the location of the first tap. The weakest tap is removed.

\- When the selected tap is the last tap, the location of the merged tap
is the location of the last tap. The weakest tap is removed.

\- Otherwise, the location of the merged tap is based on the average
delay of the weakest tap and selected tap. If the average delay is on
the sampling grid, the location of the merged tap is the average delay.
Otherwise, the location of the merged tap is rounded towards the
direction of the selected tap (e.g. 10 ns & 20 ns 15 ns, 10 ns & 25 ns
20 ns, if 25 ns had higher or equal power; 15 ns, if 10 ns had higher
power). The weakest tap and the selected tap are removed.

\- Repeat step 6 until the final number of taps is 12.

\- Step 7: Round the amplitudes of taps to one decimal (e.g. -8.78 dB
-8.8 dB)

\- Step 8: If the delay spread has slightly changed due to the tap
merge, adjust the final delay spread by increasing or decreasing the
power of the last tap so that the delay spread is corrected.

\- Step 9: Re-normalize the highest tap to 0 dB.

Note 1: Some values of the delay profile created by the simplification
steps may differ from the values in tables F.2.2.2-2, F.2.2.2-3, and
F.2.1.1-4 for the corresponding model.

Note 2: For Step 5 and Step 6, the power values are expressed in the
linear domain using 6 digits of precision. The operations are in the
linear domain.

### F.2.2.2 Delay profiles for FR1

The delay profiles for FR1 are selected to be representative of low,
medium and high delay spread environment. The resulting model parameters
are specified in F.2.2.2-1 and the tapped delay line models are
specified in tables F.2.2.2-2 \~ table F.2.2.2-4.

The correlation matrices for high, medium and low correlation are
defined in table F.2.4.2.3-2, F.2.4.2.3-3 and F.2.4.2.3-4 as below.

The values in table F.2.4.2.3-2 have been adjusted for the 2x4 and 4x4
high correlation cases to ensure the correlation matrix is positive
semi-definite after round-off to 4 digit precision. This is done using
the equation:

![](media/image67.wmf){width="2.0in" height="0.28125in"}

Where the value \"a\" is a scaling factor such that the smallest value
is used to obtain a positive semi-definite result. For the 2x4 high
correlation case, a = 0.00010. For the 4x4 high correlation case, a =
0.00012.

The same method is used to adjust the 4x4 medium correlation matrix in
table F.2.4.2.3-3 to insure the correlation matrix is positive
semi-definite after round-off to 4 digit precision with a = 0.00012.

### F.2.4.3 Multi-antenna channel models using cross polarized antennas

#### F.2.4.3.1 General

The MIMO channel correlation matrices defined in annex F.2.4.3 apply to
two cases as presented below:

\- One TX antenna and multiple RX antennas case, with cross polarized
antennas used at IAB

\- Multiple TX antennas and multiple RX antennas case, with cross
polarized antennas used at both UE and IAB

The cross-polarized antenna elements with +/-45 degrees polarization
slant angles are deployed at IAB. For one TX antenna case, antenna
element with +90 degree polarization slant angle is deployed at UE. For
multiple TX antennas case, cross-polarized antenna elements with +90/0
degrees polarization slant angles are deployed at UE.

For the cross-polarized antennas, the N antennas are labelled such that
antennas for one polarization are listed from 1 to N/2 and antennas for
the other polarization are listed from N/2+1 to N, where N is the number
of TX or RX antennas.

#### F.2.4.3.5 Beam steering approach

For the 2D cross-polarized antenna array at gNB, given the channel
spatial correlation matrix in F.2.4.3.2, F.2.4.3.3 and F.2.4.3.4, the
corresponding random channel matrix *H* can be calculated. The signal
model for the *k*-th slot is denoted as

And the steering matrix is further expressed as following:

where

######## Annex G (normative): In-channel TX tests for IAB-DU

The Annex H in TS 38.141-1 \[13\] applies to FR1 IAB-DU.

######## Annex H (normative): In-channel TX tests for IAB-MT

H.0 Applicability
=================

FR1 IAB-MT EVM can be determined by the process according to following
alternatives:

Alternative 1: Annex E in TS 38.521-1 \[16\]. Only CP-OFDM waveform of
PUSCH is measured for IAB-MT or

Alternative 2: from Annex H.1 to Annex H.7.

H.1 General
===========

The in-channel TX test enables the measurement of all relevant
parameters that describe the in-channel quality of the output signal of
the TX under test in a single measurement process.

The parameters describing the in-channel quality of a transmitter,
however, are not necessarily independent. The algorithm chosen for
description inside this annex places particular emphasis on the
exclusion of all interdependencies among the parameters.

H.2 Basic principles
====================

The process is based on the comparison of the actual output signal of
the TX under test, received by an ideal receiver, with an ideal signal,
that is generated by the measuring equipment and represents an ideal
error free received signal. All signals are represented as equivalent
(generally complex) baseband signals.

The description below uses numbers and illustrations as examples only.
These numbers are taken from a TDD frame structure with normal CP
length, 30 kHz SCS and a transmission bandwidth configuration of 100 MHz
(*N*~RB~ = 273). The application of the text below, however, is not
restricted to this parameter set.

H.2.1 Output signal of the TX under test
----------------------------------------

The output signal of the TX under test is acquired by the measuring
equipment and stored for further processing. It is sampled at a sampling
rate which is the product of the SCS and the *FFT size*, and it is named
$z\left( \upsilon \right)$. The *FFT size* is determined by the
transmission bandwidth in table 6.5.3.5-2 for 15 kHz SCS, table
6.5.3.5-3 for 30 kHz SCS and table 6.5.3.5-4 for 60 kHz SCS. In the time
domain, it comprises at least 10 ms. It is modelled as a signal with the
following parameters:

\- demodulated data content,

\- carrier frequency,

\- amplitude and phase for each subcarrier.

For the example in the annex, the *FFT size* is 4096 based on table
6.5.3.5-3. The sampling rate of 122.88 Msps is the product of the *FFT
size* and SCS.

H.2.2 Ideal signal
------------------

Two types of ideal signals are defined:

The first ideal signal $i_{1}\left( \upsilon \right)$ is constructed by
the measuring equipment according to the relevant TX specifications,
using the following parameters:

\- demodulated data content,

\- nominal carrier frequency,

\- nominal amplitude and phase for each subcarrier.

It is represented as a sequence of samples at the sampling rate
determined from annex H.2.1 in the time domain. The structure of the
signal is described in the test models.

The second ideal signal $i_{2}\left( \upsilon \right)$ is constructed by
the measuring equipment according to the relevant TX specifications,
using the following parameters:

\- nominal demodulation reference signals (all other modulation symbols
are set to 0 V),

\- nominal carrier frequency,

\- nominal amplitude and phase for each applicable subcarrier,

\- nominal timing.

It is represented as a sequence of samples at the sampling rate
determined from annex H.2.1 in the time domain.

H.2.3 Measurement results
-------------------------

The measurement results, achieved by the in-channel TX test are the
following:

\- Carrier frequency error

\- EVM

\- Resource element TX power

\- OFDM symbol TX power (OSTP)

Other side results are: residual amplitude- and phase response of the TX
chain after equalisation.

H.2.4 Measurement points
------------------------

The resource element TX power is measured after the FFT box as described
in figure H.2.4-1. The EVM shall be measured at the point after the FFT
and a zero-forcing (ZF) equalizer in the receiver, as depicted for FR1
in figure H.2.4-1. The FFT window of *FFT size* samples out of (*FFT
size* + cyclic prefix length) samples in the time domain is selected in
the \"Remove CP\" box. The *FFT size* and the cyclic prefix length are
obtained from table 6.5.3.5-2 for 15 kHz SCS, table 6.5.3.5-3 for 30 kHz
SCS and table 6.5.3.5-4 for 60 kHz SCS.

In one subframe, there are two symbols with the length of the cyclic
prefix larger than the values listed in tables 6.5.3.5-2, 6.5.3.5-3 and
6.5.3.5-4. Table H.2.4-1 lists the slot number and the symbol number and
the formula how to compute the length of cyclic prefix for those two
symbols according to the sampling rate.

length for normal CP

                                     (symbol 7, slot 0)                     

  30          2                      (symbol 0, slot 0)\                    CP length + *FFT size* / 64
                                     (symbol 0, slot 1)                     

  60          4                      (symbol 0, slot 0)\                    CP length + *FFT size* / 32
                                     (symbol 0, slot 2)                     
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For the example used in the annex, the \"Remove CP\" box selects 4096
samples out of 4384 samples. Symbol 0 has 64 more samples in the cyclic
prefix than the other 13 symbols in the slot (the longer CP length =
352).

H.3 Pre-FFT minimization process
================================

Sample Timing, Carrier Frequency in $z\left( \upsilon \right)$ are
varied in order to minimise the difference between
$z\left( \upsilon \right)$ and $i_{1}\left( \upsilon \right)$, after the
amplitude ratio of $z\left( \upsilon \right)$ and
$i_{1}\left( \upsilon \right)$ has been scaled. Best fit (minimum
difference) is achieved when the RMS difference value between
$z\left( \upsilon \right)$ and $i_{1}\left( \upsilon \right)$ is an
absolute minimum.

The carrier frequency variation is the measurement result: carrier
frequency error.

From the acquired samples, one value of carrier frequency error can be
derived.

Note 1: The minimisation process, to derive the RF error can be
supported by post-FFT operations. However the minimisation process
defined in the pre-FFT domain comprises all acquired samples (i.e. it
does not exclude the samples in-between the FFT widths and it does not
exclude the bandwidth outside the transmission bandwidth configuration).

Note 2: The algorithm would allow to derive carrier frequency error and
sample frequency error of the TX under test separately. However there
are no requirements for sample frequency error. Hence the algorithm
models the RF and the sample frequency commonly (not independently). It
returns one error and does not distinguish between both.

After this process, the samples $z\left( \upsilon \right)$ are called
$z^{0}\left( \upsilon \right)$.

H.4 Timing of the FFT window
============================

The FFT window length is *FFT size* samples per OFDM symbol.

The position in time for the FFT shall be determined.

In an ideal signal, the FFT may start at any instant within the cyclic
prefix without causing an error. The TX filter, however, reduces the
window. The EVM requirements shall be met within a window *W* \< CP.
There are three different instants for FFT:

\- Centre of the reduced window, called $\mathrm{\Delta}\widetilde{c}$,

\- $\mathrm{\Delta}c - W/2$, and

\- $\mathrm{\Delta}c + W/2$.

The value of EVM window length *W* is obtained from tables 6.5.3.5-2 for
15 kHz SCS, 6.5.3.5-3 for 30 kHz SCS and 6.5.3.5-4 for 60 kHz SCS and
the transmission bandwidth.

The IAB-MT shall transmit a signal according to the test models intended
for EVM. The demodulation reference signal of the second ideal signal
shall be used to find the centre of the FFT window.

The timing of the measured signal is determined in the pre-FFT domain as
follows, using $z^{0}\left( \upsilon \right)$ and
$i_{2}\left( \upsilon \right)$:

1\. The measured signal is delay spread by the TX filter. Hence the
distinct borders between the OFDM symbols and between data and CP are
also spread and the timing is not obvious.

2\. In the ideal signal $i_{2}\left( \upsilon \right)$, the timing is
known.

Correlation between bullet (1) and (2) will result in a correlation
peak. The meaning of the correlation peak is approximately the \"impulse
response\" of the TX filter.

3\. The meaning of \"impulse response\" assumes that the autocorrelation
of the ideal signal $i_{2}\left( \upsilon \right)$ is a Dirac peak and
that the correlation between the ideal signal
$i_{2}\left( \upsilon \right)$ and the data in the measured signal is 0.
The correlation peak, (the highest, or in case of more than one highest,
the earliest) indicates the timing in the measured signal.

The number of samples used for FFT is reduced compared to
$z^{0}\left( \upsilon \right)$. This subset of samples is called
$z'\left( \upsilon \right)$.

From the acquired samples one timing can be derived.

The timing of the centre $\mathrm{\Delta}\widetilde{c}$ is determined
according to the cyclic prefix length of the OFDM symbols. For normal
CP, there are two values for $\mathrm{\Delta}\widetilde{c}$ in a 1 ms
period:

\- $\mathrm{\Delta}\widetilde{c}$ = length of cyclic prefix / 2,

\- $\mathrm{\Delta}\widetilde{c}$ = Longer CP length - length of cyclic
prefix / 2,

Where the length of cyclic prefix is obtained from table 6.5.3.5-2 for
15 kHz SCS, table 6.5.3.5-3 for 30 kHz SCS and table 6.5.3.5-4 for 60
kHz SCS, and the longer CP length is obtained from table H.2.4-1.

As per the example values:

\- $\mathrm{\Delta}\widetilde{c}$ = 144 within the CP of length 288 for
OFDM symbols 1 to 13 of a slot,

\- $\mathrm{\Delta}\widetilde{c}$ = 208= 352 - 144) within the CP of
length 352 for OFDM symbol 0 of a slot.

H.5 Resource element TX power
=============================

Perform FFT on $z'\left( \nu \right)$ with the FFT window timing
$\mathrm{\Delta}\widetilde{c}$. The result is called
$Z'\left( t,f \right)$. The RE TX power (RETP) is then defined as:

$$\text{RETP} = \left| Z'\left( t,f \right) \right|^{2}\text{SCS}$$

Where SCS is the subcarrier spacing in Hz.

From RETP the OFDM Symbol TX power (OSTP) is derived as follows:

$$OSTP = \frac{1}{N_{\text{sym}}}\sum_{}^{}\text{RETP}$$

Where the summation accumulates $N_{\text{RB}}N_{\text{sc}}^{\text{RB}}$
RETP values of all *N~sym~* OFDM symbols that carry PUSCH and not
containing PUCCH, SRS or PRACH within a slot.

From the acquired samples, $N_{\text{ul}}$ values for each OSTP can be
obtained and averaged where for TDD, $N_{\text{ul}}$ is the number of
slots with uplink symbols in a 10 ms measurement interval and is
computed according to the values in table 4.9.2.2-1.

For the example used in the annex, $N_{\text{ul}} = 20$ and
$N_{\text{RB}} = 273$.

H.6 Post-FFT equalisation
=========================

Perform$14N_{\text{ul}}$ FFTs on $z'\left( \nu \right)$, one for each
OFDM symbol within 10 ms measurement interval with the FFT window timing
to produce an array of samples, $14N_{\text{ul}}$ in the time axis *t*
by *FFT size* in the frequency axis *f*.

For the example in the annex, 280 FFTs are performed on
$z'\left( \nu \right)$. The result is an array of samples, 280 in the
time axis by 4096 in the frequency axis.

The equalizer coefficients $\widetilde{a}\left( f \right)$ and
$\widetilde{\varphi}\left( f \right)\ $are determined as follows:

1\. Calculate the complex ratios (amplitude and phase) of the post-FFT
acquired signal $Z'\left( t,f \right)\ $and the post-FFT ideal signal
$I_{2}\left( t,f \right)$ for each demodulation reference signal, over
10 ms measurement interval. This process creates a set of complex
ratios:

$$a\left( t,f \right)e^{\text{jφ}\left( t,f \right)} = \frac{Z'\left( t,f \right)}{I_{2}\left( t,f \right)}$$

2\. Perform time averaging at each demodulation reference signal
subcarrier of the complex ratios, the time-averaging length is 10 ms
measurement interval. Prior to the averaging of the phases
$\varphi\left( t_{i},f \right)$ an unwrap operation must be performed
according to the following definition:

\- The unwrap operation corrects the radian phase angles of
$\varphi\left( t_{i},f \right)$ by adding multiples of 2 \* π when
absolute phase jumps between consecutive time instances $t_{i}$ are
greater than or equal to the jump tolerance of π radians.

\- This process creates an average amplitude and phase for each
demodulation reference signal subcarrier (i.e. every second subcarrier).

$$a\left( f \right) = \frac{\sum_{i = 1}^{N}{a\left( t_{i},f \right)}}{N}$$

> and

$$\varphi\left( f \right) = \frac{\sum_{i = 1}^{N}{\varphi\left( t_{i},f \right)}}{N}$$

> Where *N* is the number of demodulation reference signals time-domain
> locations $t_{i}$ from $Z'\left( t,f \right)$ for each demodulation
> reference signal subcarrier *f*.

3\. The equalizer coefficients for amplitude and phase
$\widehat{a}\left( f \right)$ and $\widehat{\varphi}\left( f \right)$ at
the demodulation reference signal subcarriers are obtained by computing
the moving average in the frequency domain of the time-averaged
demodulation reference signal subcarriers. The moving average window
size is 19 and averaging is over the DM-RS subcarriers in the allocated
RBs. For DM-RS subcarriers at or near the edge of the channel, or when
the number of available DM-RS subcarriers within a set of contiguously
allocated RBs is smaller than the moving average window size, the window
size is reduced accordingly as per figure H.6-1.

4\. Perform linear interpolation from the equalizer coefficients
$\widehat{a}\left( f \right)$ and $\widehat{\varphi}\left( f \right)$ to
compute coefficients$\widetilde{\text{\ a}}\left( f \right)$,
$\widetilde{\varphi}\left( f \right)$ for each subcarrier.

H.7 EVM
=======

H.7.0 General
-------------

For EVM create two sets of $Z_{\text{eq}}'\left( t,f \right)$, according
to the timing $\left( \mathrm{\Delta}c - W/2 \right)$ and
$\left( \mathrm{\Delta}c + W/2 \right)$, using the equalizer
coefficients from H.6.

The equivalent ideal samples are calculated from
$i_{1}\left( \upsilon \right)$ (annex H.2.2) and are called
$I\left( t,f \right)$.

The EVM is the difference between the ideal signal and the equalized
measured signal.

$$EVM = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{\text{tϵT}}^{}{\sum_{\text{fϵF}\left( i \right)}^{}\left| Z_{\text{eq}}'\left( t,f \right) - I\left( t,f \right) \right|^{2}}}{\sum_{\text{tϵT}}^{}{\sum_{\text{fϵF}\left( i \right)}^{}\left| I\left( t,f \right) \right|^{2}}}}$$

Where:

> \- T is the set of symbols with the considered modulation scheme being
> active within the slot,
>
> \- $F\left( t \right)$ is the set of subcarriers within the resource
> blocks with the considered modulation scheme being active in symbol
> *t*,
>
> \- $I\left( t,f \right)$ *is* the ideal signal reconstructed by the
> measurement equipment in accordance with relevant test models,
>
> \- $Z_{\text{eq}}'\left( t,f \right)$ is the equalized signal under
> test.

NOTE: Although the basic unit of measurement is one slot, the equalizer
is calculated over the entire 10 ms measurement interval to reduce the
impact of noise in the reference signals.

H.7.1 Averaged EVM (TDD)
------------------------

EVM is averaged over all allocated uplink resource blocks with the
considered modulation scheme in the frequency domain, and a minimum of
$N_{\text{ul}}$ slots where $N_{\text{ul}}$ is the number of slots in a
10 ms measurement interval.

For TDD, let $N_{\text{ul}}^{\text{TDD}}$ be the number of slots with
uplink symbols within a 10 ms measurement interval, the averaging in the
time domain can be calculated from $N_{\text{ul}}^{\text{TDD}}$ slots of
different 10 ms measurement intervals and should have a minimum of
$N_{\text{ul}}\ $slots averaging length where $N_{\text{ul}}\ $is the
number of slots in a 10 ms measurement interval.

*-* ${\overline{\text{EVM}}}_{\text{frame}}$ is derived by: Square the
EVM results in each 10 ms measurement interval. Sum the squares, divide
the sum by the number of EVM relevant locations, square-root the
quotient (RMS).

$${\overline{\text{EVM}}}_{\text{frame}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{\sum_{i = 1}^{N_{\text{ul}}^{\text{TDD}}}N_{i}}\sum_{i = 1}^{N_{\text{ul}}^{\text{TDD}}}{\sum_{j = 1}^{N_{i}}\text{EVM}_{i,j}^{2}}}$$

*- Where* $N_{i}$ is the number of resource blocks with the considered
modulation scheme in slot *i*.

*-* The $\text{EVM}_{\text{frame}}$ is calculated, using the maximum of
${\overline{\text{EVM}}}_{\text{frame}}$ at the window *W* extremities.
Thus ${\overline{\text{EVM}}}_{\text{frame,l}}$ is calculated using
$\widetilde{t} = \mathrm{\Delta}{\widetilde{t}}_{l}$ and
${\overline{\text{EVM}}}_{\text{frame,h}}$ is calculated using
$\widetilde{t} = \mathrm{\Delta}{\widetilde{t}}_{h}$ (*l* and *h*, low
and high; where low is the timing
$\left( \mathrm{\Delta}c - W/2 \right)$ and and high is the timing
$\left( \mathrm{\Delta}c + W/2 \right)$).

$$\text{EVM}_{\text{frame}} = \max\left( {\overline{\text{EVM}}}_{\text{frame,l}},{\overline{\text{EVM}}}_{\text{frame,h}} \right)$$

*-* In order to unite at least $N_{\text{ul}}$ slots, consider the
minimum integer number of 10 ms measurement intervals, where
$N_{\text{frame}}$ is determined by.

$$N_{\text{frame}} = \left\lceil \frac{10 \times N_{\text{slot}}}{N_{\text{ul}}^{\text{TDD}}} \right\rceil$$

and $N_{\text{slot}} = 1$ for 15 kHz SCS, $N_{\text{slot}} = 2$ for 30
kHz SCS and $N_{\text{slot}} = 4$ for 60 kHz SCS normal CP.

*-* Unite by RMS.

$$\overline{\text{EVM}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N_{\text{frame}}}\sum_{k = 1}^{N_{\text{frame}}}\text{EVM}_{\text{frame},k}^{2}}$$
