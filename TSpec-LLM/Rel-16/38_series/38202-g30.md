4 Services and functions of the physical layer
==============================================

4.1 General
-----------

The physical layer offers data transport services to higher layers.

The access to these services is through the use of transport channels
via the MAC sub-layer.

A transport block is defined as the data delivered by MAC layer to the
physical layer and vice versa.

4.2 Overview of L1 functions
----------------------------

As mentioned in \[2, TS 38.201\], the physical layer is expected to
perform the following functions to provide the data transport service:

\- Error detection on the transport channel and indication to higher
layers;

\- FEC encoding/decoding of the transport channel;

\- Hybrid ARQ soft-combining;

\- Rate matching of the coded transport channel to physical channels;

\- Mapping of the coded transport channel onto physical channels;

\- Power weighting of physical channels;

\- Modulation and demodulation of physical channels;

\- Frequency and time synchronisation;

\- Radio characteristics measurements and indication to higher layers;

\- Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) antenna processing;

\- RF processing.

L1 functions are modelled for each transport channel in clause 5.

5 Model of physical layer of the UE
===================================

The 5G-NR physical-layer model captures those characteristics of the
5G-NR physical-layer that are relevant from the point-of-view of higher
layers. More specifically, the physical-layer model captures:

\- The structure of higher-layer data being passed down to or up from
the physical layer;

\- The means by which higher layers can configure the physical layer;

\- The different indications (error indications, channel-quality
indications, etc.) that are provided by the physical layer to higher
layers.

5.1 Uplink model
----------------

### 5.1.1 Uplink shared channel

The physical-layer model for Uplink Shared Channel transmission is
described based on the corresponding PUSCH physical-layer-processing
chain, see Figure 5.1.1-1. Processing steps that are relevant for the
physical-layer model, e.g. in the sense that they are configurable by
higher layers, are highlighted in blue.

\- Higher-layer data passed to/from the physical layer

\- CRC and transport-block-error indication

\- FEC and rate *matching*

\- Data modulation

\- Mapping to physical resource

6 Simultaneous transmission and reception of physical channels and physical signals
===================================================================================

This clause describes the requirements from the UE to send and receive
multiple physical channels and physical signals simultaneously depending
on the capabilities and service requirements. The following notation is
used between both the uplink and downlink clauses below.

*- p* is the number of uplink carriers configured for the UE on which
physical channels can be transmitted

*- p\'* is the number of uplink carriers configured for the UE on which
SRS can be transmitted

*- q* is the number of downlink carriers configured for the UE

*- j* is the number of cell groups configured for the UE.

*- k* is the number of PUCCH groups configured for the UE.

The tables 6.1-1 and 6.1-2 describe the possible combinations of
physical channels and SRS that can be sent in simultaneously in the
uplink by one UE. Table 6.1-1 introduces notation for a \"Transmission
Type\" which represents a physical channel or sounding reference signal,
and any associated transport channel. Table 6.1-2 describes the

UE depending on capabilities \[8, TS 38.306\], and enumerates how many
of each can be transmitted simultaneously.

6.3 Sidelink
------------

The tables 6.3-1 and 6.3-2 describe the possible combinations of
physical channels that can be sent simultaneously in the sidelink by a
UE. Table 6.3-1 introduces notation for a sidelink \"Transmission Type\"
which represents a physical channel, and any associated transport
channel. Table 6.3-2 describes the combinations of these \"Transmission
Types\" which are supported by the UE depending on capabilities \[8, TS
38.306\], and enumerates how many of each can be transmitted
simultaneously.

  Note: Depending on the UE capability, the UE may be able to perform simultaneous Uplink and Sidelink transmissions. If the simultaneous transmission of Sidelink and Uplink is beyond the UE capability, the one not prioritized can be dropped according to \[TS 38.321.   

The tables 6.3-3 and 6.3-4 describe the possible combinations of
physical channels that can be received simultaneously in the sidelink by
a UE. Table 6.3-3 introduces notation for a sidelink \"Reception Type\"
which represents a physical channel, and any associated transport
channel. Table 6.3-4 describes the combinations of these \"Transmission
Types\" which are supported by the UE depending on capabilities \[8, TS
38.306\], and enumerates how many of each can be received
