Introduction
============

A study item, \"Study on NR-based Access to Unlicensed Spectrum\", was
approved at 3GPP TSG RAN \#77 \[2\] and revised in 3GPP TSG RAN \#80
\[30\]. This study is to determine a single global solution for NR-based
access to unlicensed spectrum, to be compatible with the NR concepts.

The objectives of the study include:

\- Study NR-based operation in unlicensed spectrum (RAN1, RAN2, RAN4)
including

> \- Physical channels inheriting the choices of duplex mode, waveform,
> carrier bandwidth, subcarrier spacing, frame structure, and physical
> layer design made as part of the NR study and avoiding unnecessary
> divergence with decisions made in the NR WI
>
> \- Consider unlicensed bands below 7GHz
>
> \- Consider similar forward compatibility principles made in the NR WI
>
> \- Initial access, channel access. Scheduling/HARQ, and mobility
> including connected/inactive/idle mode operation and radio-link
> monitoring/failure
>
> \- Coexistence methods within NR-based and between NR-based operation
> in unlicensed and LTE-based LAA and with other incumbent RATs in
> accordance with regulatory requirements in e.g., 5GHz , 6GHz bands
>
> \- Coexistence methods already defined for 5GHz band in LTE-based LAA
> context should be assumed as the baseline for 5GHz operation.
> Enhancements in 5GHz over these methods should not be precluded.
> NR-based operation in unlicensed spectrum should not impact deployed
> Wi-Fi services (data, video and voice services) more than an
> additional Wi-Fi network on the same carrier

The above study will address the following architectural scenarios
(RAN2):

\- An NR-based LAA cell(s) connects with an LTE or NR anchor cell
operating in licensed spectrum

\- The study assumes the techniques for linking between Pcell (LTE or NR
licensed CC) and Scell (NR unlicensed CCs) according to the NR WI

\- An NR-based cell operating standalone in unlicensed spectrum,
connected to a 5G-CN network, e.g., for private network deployments;

\- Study how to ensure from a RAN level that connection and security
management can be integrated with the E-UTRAN, NG RAN and 5G CN
architecture, including service continuity requirements for users moving
between cells of licensed and unlicensed frequency bands, liaising with
SA2 as required

The results and findings of the study are documented in this technical
report.

 1 Scope
=======

The present document contains the results and findings from the study
item, \"Study on NR-based Access to Unlicensed Spectrum\" \[2\]. The
purpose of this TR is to document the identified NR enhancements and
corresponding evaluations for a single global solution framework for NR
based access to unlicensed spectrum.

This document addresses evaluation methodology and possible scenarios
for NR based unlicensed deployments.

This technical report documents the existing regulatory requirements for
unlicensed spectrum deployment in the 5GHz bands, \[and other bands\]

This document identifies and captures coexistence evaluations of
physical layer options and enhancements to NR and, if necessary, NR RAN
protocols to meet the requirements and targets for unlicensed spectrum
deployments.

This document contains an assessment of the feasibility of base station
and terminal operation of 5GHz band (based on regulatory limits) in
conjunction with relevant licensed frequency bands.

This document is a \'living\' document, i.e. it is permanently updated
and presented to TSG-RAN meetings.

4 Regulatory requirements
=========================

4.1 Regulatory requirements for 5GHz band
-----------------------------------------

The range 5150-5925 MHz, or parts thereof, is potentially available for
license-assisted access to unlicensed operation. This represents a
significant amount of spectrum that can be used by operators to augment
their service offerings in licensed bands. The range above can be
operated under a license-exempt regime or ISM but must be shared with
existing mobile services and other incumbent services. The quality of
service offered by a licensed regime can therefore not be matched.
Hence, unlicensed access is viewed as complementary, and does not reduce
the need for additional allocations for licensed operation in view of
the increased demand for wireless broadband access.

It is relevant to consider the global (International) ITU-R allocations
and technical provisions first. These could be basis for defining
globally harmonised bands for LAA and starting points for requirements
and limits before the local variations are considered.

**[5150-5350 and 5470-5725 MHz]{.underline}**

WRC 2003 allocated the bands 5 150-5 350 MHz and 5 470-5 725 MHz on a
co-primary basis to the mobile service for the implementation of
\"wireless access systems (WAS), including radio local area networks
(RLANs)\". This was subject to technical and regulatory provisions
included in the radio regulations given in Resolution 229 (WRC-03),
which was subsequently revised at WRC-12 to Resolution 229 (Rev. WRC-12)
\[38\]. These provisions are followed by many Administrations and
resolves:

1\) that the use of these bands by the mobile service will be for the
implementation of WAS, including RLANs, as described in the most recent
version of Recommendation ITU‑R M.1450;

2\) that in the band 5 150-5 250 MHz, stations in the mobile service
shall be restricted to indoor use with a maximum mean e.i.r.p. of 200 mW
and a maximum mean e.i.r.p. density of 10 mW/MHz in any 1 MHz band or
equivalently 0.25 mW/25 kHz in any 25 kHz band;

3\) that administrations may monitor whether the aggregate pfd levels
given in Recommendation ITU‑R S.1426 have been, or will be exceeded in
the future, in order to enable a future competent conference to take
appropriate action;

4\) that in the band 5 250-5 350 MHz, stations in the mobile service
shall be limited to a maximum mean e.i.r.p. of 200 mW and a maximum mean
e.i.r.p. density of 10 mW/MHz in any 1 MHz band. Administrations are
requested to take appropriate measures that will result in the
predominant number of stations in the mobile service being operated in
an indoor environment. Furthermore, stations in the mobile service that
are permitted to be used either indoors or outdoors may operate up to a
maximum mean e.i.r.p. of 1 W and a maximum mean e.i.r.p. density of
50 mW/MHz in any 1 MHz band, and, when operating above a mean e.i.r.p.
of 200 mW, these stations shall comply with the following e.i.r.p.
elevation angle mask where θ is the angle above the local horizontal
plane (of the Earth):

--13 dB(W/MHz) for 0° [\<]{.underline} θ \< 8°

--13 -- 0.716(θ-8) dB(W/MHz) for 8° [\<]{.underline} θ \< 40°

--35.9 -- 1.22(θ-40) dB(W/MHz) for 40° [\<]{.underline} θ
[\<]{.underline} 45°

--42 dB(W/MHz) for 45° \< θ;

5\) that administrations may exercise some flexibility in adopting other
mitigation techniques, provided that they develop national regulations
to meet their obligations to achieve an equivalent level of protection
to the EESS (active) and the SRS (active) based on their system
characteristics and interference criteria as stated in Recommendation
ITU‑R RS.1632;

6\) that in the band 5 470-5 725 MHz, stations in the mobile service
shall be restricted to a maximum transmitter power of 250 mW^3^
(*administrations with existing regulations prior to WRC 03 may exercise
some flexibility in determining transmitter power limits)* with a
maximum mean e.i.r.p. of 1 W and a maximum mean e.i.r.p. density of
50 mW/MHz in any 1 MHz band;

7\) that in the bands 5 250-5 350 MHz and 5 470-5 725 MHz, systems in
the mobile service shall either employ transmitter power control to
provide, on average, a mitigation factor of at least 3 dB on the maximum
average output power of the systems, or, if transmitter power control is
not in use, then the maximum mean e.i.r.p. shall be reduced by 3 dB;

8\) that, in the bands 5 250-5 350 MHz and 5 470-5 725 MHz, the
mitigation measures found in Annex 1 to Recommendation ITU‑R M.1652-1
shall be implemented by systems in the mobile service to ensure
compatible operation with radiodetermination systems,

This resolution makes DFS as described in the Annex 1 of ITU-R
Recommendation M.1652-1 \[39\] mandatory, the basis for the DFS
requirements developed e.g. in Europe and the US.

WAS is defined as end-user radio connections to public or private core
networks, while primary allocation means that the services can claim
protection from services of the secondary service. However, the WAS/RLAN
services must protect the incumbent primary services.

Even if primary in the International table of allocations, this may not
be the case in all countries. The bands are not allocated on a primary
basis in the US allocation table, but to the Part 15 rules that provide
for operation of low power radio transmitters without a license
(secondary service operated on a non-interference basis).

**[5725-5850 MHz]{.underline}**

The 5725-5875 MHz is allocated for ISM applications by means a footnote
in the allocation table. Radiolocation is allocated on primary basis up
to 5850 MHz so DFS is required up to this limit. Operation in 5725-5850
MHz is allowed in the US under the Part 15 rules (15.247 and 15.407).

**[5850-5925 MHz]{.underline}**

The band is allocated to the mobile service on a primary basis in all
regions. In Europe it has been decided (2008) to harmonise the use of
the 5875-5925 MHz frequency band for Intelligent Transport Systems
(ITS). Similarly, according to the US allocation table, the use of the
non-Federal mobile service in the band 5850-5925 MHz is limited to
Dedicated Short Range Communications operating in the Intelligent
Transportation System radio service.

### 4.1.1 ITU Region 1

#### 4.1.1.1 Europe

The European regulation is determined by the European Commission and the
ECC. The relevant regulations for the 5 GHz bands are found in two
Commission Decisions \[8, 9\] and one ECC Decision \[10\]. These are
interpreted by ETSI and used as a basis for harmonized standards, which
are used for conformance declaration when products are placed on the
European market. Harmonized European standards have a higher regulatory
relevance than other product standards, since they are produced based on
a mandate from the Commission with reference to an EU directive. They
also go through a public enquiry and voting process, and are cited by
the Commission. The European requirements on 5 GHz unlicensed deployment
are specified in three ETSI harmonized standards \[5, 6, and 7\]. Figure
4.1.1.1-1 summarizes the relevant parts of the 5 GHz band set aside for
unlicensed spectrum usage. The 5150-5350 MHz and the 5470-5725 MHz bands
are referred here as the broadband radio access networks (BRAN) bands
where the wireless access systems (WAS) including RLAN equipment are
operating in. Moreover, the 5725-5875 MHz band (in the BRAN domain) is
used by the fixed wireless access (FWA) networks and finally the
intelligent transport systems (ITS) utilize the 5855-5925 MHz band.

The BFWA and the ITS are designated by the ECC for use as parts of the 5
GHz band and the relevant regulations are found in:

\- An ECC Recommendation for FBWA \[14\], and

\- A Commission Decision \[15\], an ECC Decision \[16\] and an ECC
Recommendation for ITS \[17\].

General purpose SRD devices can also operate in the band 5725-5875 MHz
under the provisions of the ETSI harmonised standard EN 300 440 \[18\],
but with reduced max EIRP of 25 mW.

Figure 4.1.1.1-1: 5 GHz spectrum allocations in Europe.

The European Commission has recently submitted to CEPT a mandate to
study the conditions for the extension of the 5 GHz range designated for
WAS/RLANs \[19\] in order to allow the use by WAS/RLANs of the whole
5150-5925 MHz band.

ECC approved CEPT Report 57 in March 2015 in response to the mandate
based on the results of the Public Consultation. CEPT has carried out a
significant amount of work but studies on mitigation techniques have not
been completed in the timeframe and there are still a number of open
issues ongoing.

Figure 4.1.1.1-2: Summary of existing and proposed EU regulations for
WAS/RLANs in the 5GHz band

In the rest of this section, the specified ETSI requirements for the
WAS/RLAN and FWA bands are summarized. Table 4.1.1.1-1 provides the
limits on the transmit power control (TPC), the RF output power and
power density given by the mean EIRP and the mean EIRP density at the
highest power level. Additionally the requirements on the transmitter
out of band emissions are listed in Table 4.1.1.1-2, Figures 4.1.1.1-3a,
and Figure 4.1.1.1-3b. Table 4.1.1.1-4 illustrates the DFS requirements
for some of these bands in Europe. Moreover, the 5150-5350 MHz is
restricted to indoor deployments.

Transmit Power Control (TPC) is a mechanism to be used by the RLAN
device to ensure a mitigation factor of at least 3 dB on the aggregate
power from a large number of devices. This requires the RLAN device with
TPC to have a TPC range for which the lowest value is at least 6 dB
below the values for mean EIRP given in Table 4.1.1.1-1.

In ETSI EN 301 893 \[5\], the requirements on the Nominal Channel
Bandwidth and the Occupied Channel Bandwidth are defined for unlicensed
spectrum in the 5 GHz region. The Nominal Channel Bandwidth, i.e., the
widest band of frequencies inclusive of guard bands assigned to a single
channel, shall be at least 5MHz at all times. The Occupied Channel
Bandwidth, i.e., the bandwidth containing 99 % of the power of the
signal, shall be between 80 % and 100 % of the declared Nominal Channel
Bandwidth. During an established communication, a device is allowed to
operate temporarily in a mode where its Occupied Channel Bandwidth may
be reduced to as low as 40 % of its Nominal Channel Bandwidth with a
minimum of 4 MHz. The Occupied Channel Bandwidth is determined by the
test procedure defined in Section 5.3.3.2 in \[5\].

ETSI mandates the usage of DFS in some bands as shown in Table
4.1.1.1-4. Furthermore, a Listen-Before-Talk (LBT) mechanism is
requested independently of whether the channel is occupied or not
(Section 4.2.7 of \[5\]). Note that no LBT requirement is requested in
\[6\] for the FWA band.

**[Interference to Weather Radars]{.underline}**

Interference to Weather Radars is also a hot topic in the EU. The two
last versions of EN 301 893 (1.6.1 and 1.7.1) have included amendments
to better protect these radars, like the prohibition to give the user
access to the configuration control settings that would allow him to
disconnect the DFS functionality.

The use of the band 5.60-5.65 GHz by WLANs is allowed in Europe, and a
Market Surveillance campaign on WLANs 5 GHz has been led at EU level by
the ADCO R&TTE Group. The report \[20\] of the campaign has proposed
specific recommendations to improve the situation. These recommendations
do not require amendments to the last version of EN 301 893.

#### 4.1.1.2 Israel

In Israel the bands 5150-5250 MHz and 5250-5350 MHz are open to RLANs.

#### 4.1.1.3 Russia

In the Russian Federation the bands 5150-5350 MHz, the band 5470-5725
MHz above 5650 MHz and the band 5725-5825 MHz \[20\] are allowed to
RLANs. Use of DFS is not mandated.

#### 4.1.1.4 South Africa

In South Africa the bands 5150-5250 MHz and 5250-5350 MHz are available
to RLANs but restricted to indoor use. The band 5470-5725 MHz is also
open to RLANs.

#### 4.1.1.5 Turkey

In Turkey the bands 5150-5250 MHz and 5250-5350 MHz are restricted to
indoor use. DFS and TPC are mandated in the band 5470-5725 MHz.

### 4.1.2 ITU Region 2

#### 4.1.2.1 USA

The use of unlicensed 5 GHz spectrum in USA is governed by FCC part 15
regulations \[3\]. In Feb 2013, potential new rules were proposed in FCC
13-22 \[4\]. Figure 4.1.2.1-1 summarizes the relevant part 15 rules for
5GHz unlicensed spectrum usage:

![](media/image7.emf){width="6.6819444444444445in"
height="1.0583333333333333in"}

Figure 4.1.2.1-1 : Summary of existing and proposed new FCC part 15
rules for 5GHz unlicensed spectrum usage

In Figure 4.1.2.1-1, U-NII-x bands denote frequency bands for Unlicensed
National Information Infrastructure devices usage that are governed by
§15.407 \[3\]. As shown in the figure, there is also an overlapping
ruling of §15.247 from 5.725 to 5.85 GHz. A device could choose to
follow either U-NII rulings or §15.247 rulings when operating within the
frequency range.

In the rest of this section, we summarize FCC paragraphs 15.407 and
15.247 rules. In general either frequency hopping or digital modulation
techniques are permitted under part 15 rules. Since LTE is not designed
as a frequency hopping system, the rest of the document will focus on
regulations related to digital modulation.

Paragraph 15.247 rules relevant for LTE point to multi-point
communications are summarized in 4 aspects:

\- Transmission Bandwidth:

\- The minimum 6 dB bandwidth shall be at least 500 kHz.

\- Maximum Transmit Power:

\- Peak conducted output power shall not exceed 1 W. An alternative to
peak power measurements is maximum conducted output power, which is the
total transmit power over all antennas and antenna elements when the
transmitter is operating at its maximum power control level.

\- Note that, the conducted output power limit is based on the use of
antennas with directional gains that do not exceed 6 dBi. If
transmitting antennas of directional gain greater than 6 dBi are used,
the conducted output power from the intentional radiator shall be
reduced by the amount in dB that the directional gain of the antenna
exceeds 6 dBi.

\- Out of Band Emission:

\- In any 100 kHz bandwidth outside the frequency band, the radio
frequency power that is produced by the intentional radiator shall be at
least 20 dB below that in the 100 kHz bandwidth within the band that
contains the highest level of the desired power, based on either an RF
conducted or a radiated measurement. If the transmitter complies with
the conducted power limits based on the use of RMS averaging over a time
interval, the attenuation required under this paragraph shall be 30 dB
instead of 20 dB.

\- Power Spectrum Density:

\- The power spectral density conducted from the intentional radiator to
the antenna shall not be greater than 8 dBm in any 3 kHz band during any
time interval of continuous transmission. The same method of determining
the conducted output power shall be used to determine the power spectral
density.

Paragraph15.407 rules for UNII devices are summarized in following
tables. In Table 4.1.2.1-1, the maximum transmit power, PSD and out of
band emission requirements are listed for UNII-1/2/3 bands. In Table
4.1.2.1-2, the dynamic frequency selection requirements for radar
detection are summarized for UNII-2 devices.

**[Interference to Weather Radars]{.underline}**

In order to resolve interference to Terminal Doppler Weather Radar
(TDWR) the FCC has defined interim plans to approve UNII devices
operating in the 5470-5725 MHz band \[11\]. These interim plans provide
specific actions for equipment authorization and installation, as
detailed below. The main elements in the interim plan are:

\- Master devices shall not transmit on channels overlapping with the
range 5600-5650 MHz band used by TDWRs;

\- Professional installation of equipment operating within the band
5470-5720 MHz;

\- Prohibition to include configuration controls (like country code
settings) that would allow to change the frequency of operations to any
frequency other than those specified on the grant of certification for
US operation.

In parallel FCC is continuing its work to develop long-term equipment
authorization test procedures that will ensure that the devices comply
with the rules that protect the TDWR operations.

#### 4.1.2.2 Canada

In Canada, the use of RLANs is forbidden in the band 5600-5650 MHz in
order to protect the meteorological radars from interference caused by
RLANs. The regulations for RLANs in the 5 GHz range in Canada are
defined in RSS-210 Annex 9 \[21\]. Table 4.1.2.2-1 presents the transmit
power requirements for RLAN devices while Table 4.1.2.2-1 provides the
EIRP spectral density limits in the elevation plane required from RLAN
devices operating with an EIRP level higher than 200 mW in the frequency
range 5250-5350 MHz.

#### 4.1.2.3 Brazil

In Brazil, nearly all the 5 GHz spectrum is allocated for Restricted
Radiation, which means low-power unlicensed bands (i.e. any
low-power-device can use it on a secondary basis). The bands 5250-5350
MHz, 5470-5650 MHz, 5650-5725 MHz and 5725-5850 MHz are allowed to RLANs
\[22\]. Bands 5150-5250 MHz and 5250-5350 MHz are restricted to indoor
use, and DFS is mandated in the bands 5250-5350 MHz and 5470-5725 MHz.

The relevant restrictions by band are as follows \[23\]:

  From (MHz)   To (MHz)   Service                                 Restriction \[insert reference\]

  5150         5350       Restricted radiation                    Indoor use only, EIRP limited to 200mW, EIRP spectral power density limited to 10mW/MHz. DFS mandated between 5250-5350MHz.
  5350         5470       Unregulated                              
  5470         5650       Restricted radiation                    DFS mandated. Max transmitter output power limited to 250mW, EIRP limited to 1W, EIRP spectral power density limited to 50mW/MHz
  5650         5725       Restricted radiation or amateur radio   DFS mandated. Max transmitter output power limited to 250mW, EIRP limited to 1W, EIRP spectral power density limited to 50mW/MHz
  5725         5875       Restricted radiation (ISM Band)         Max transmitter output power limited to 1W, max EIRP EMF density of 50,000 microvolt per meter (measured at 3 meter distance)

NOTE: Note that the 5350-5470MHz band is not regulated.

#### 4.1.2.4 Mexico

In Mexico, the bands 5150-5250 MHz, 5250-5350 MHz, 5470-5600 MHz,
5650-5725 MHz and 5725-5875 MHz are open to RLANs \[22\].

### 4.1.3 ITU Region 3

#### 4.1.3.1 China

The 5150-5350 MHz frequency band is open to unlicensed WAS/RLANs indoor
deployment in China. Furthermore, mandatory DFS / TPC (no less than 6
dB) or DFS only with a 3 dB backoff of the max mean EIRP, Power spectrum
density and max emission is required for 5250-5350 MHz.

The key regulatory restrictions include:

\- EIRP: ≤200mW

\- Power Spectrum Density: ≤10dBm/MHz (EIPR)

\- Max Emission at edges of the used frequency:  ≤-80dBm/Hz (EIRP)

\- Spurious Emission (corresponding to frequency range outside
2.5\*carrier bandwidth )

\- 30-1000MHz: -36dBm/100kHz

\- 48.5-72.5MHz, 76-118MHz, 167-223MHz, 470-798MHz: -54dBm/100kHz

\- 2400-2483.5MHz: -40dBm/1MHz

\- 5150-5350MHz: -33dBm/100kHz

\- 5470-5850MHz: -40dBm/1MHz

\- Other frequency in 1-40GHz: -30dBm/1MHz

The 5725-5850 MHz frequency band was assigned as light licensed in 2009,
shared among operators and traffic control bureau, open for both WAS
(wireless access system) and RLAN, for both indoor and outdoor
deployment in China. The key regulatory restrictions as below:

\- Transmit Power: ≤500mW and ≤27dBm;

\- EIRP: ≤2W and ≤33dBm

\- Power Spectrum Density: ≤13dBm/MHz and ≤19dBm/MHz(EIRP)

\- Out of Band Emission:  ≤-80dBm/Hz(≤5725MHz and ≥5850MHz)

\- Spurious emission

\- 30-1000MHz: ≤-36dBm/100kHz

\- 2400-2483.5MHz: ≤-40dBm/1MHz

\- 3400-3530MHz: ≤-40dBm/1MHz

\- 5725-5850MHz: ≤-33dBm/100kHz

\- corresponding to frequency range outside 2.5\*carrier bandwidth

\- Other frequency in 1-40 GHz: -30dBm/1MHz

In the end of 2014, the regulation requirements of this band were
adjusted from light license to fully unlicensed. Meanwhile, some
restrictions for equipment were proposed to be updated such as spurious
emission etc., which was publicly inquired on the website of ministry of
industry and information technology of China without formal issued so
far. The proposed key regulation restrictions update in 5725-5850MHz can
be found in the table below.

The band 5470-5725 MHz has not yet been officially open for WAS/RLAN (is
put on hold). However, this band as a potential WAS/RLAN frequency band
has been widely discussed, while the related regulation restrictions are
also publicly inquired on the website of ministry of industry and
information technology of China in the year of 2014. In order to protect
the incumbent services (such as radio-determination service), DFS and
TPC (no less than 6dB) are strictly required and DFS function can not be
closed. The details of the proposed key regulation restrictions in
5470-5725MHz are listed as table below.

Korean regulatory requirements are summarized as follows:

\- Average PSD requirement (mW/MHz)

\- It covers both power spectral density and Max transmission power

\- The maximum PSD is defined for a given spectrum range

\- Maximum transmission power :

\- 50mW, 200mW, 200mW and 200/260mW for 5150-5250, 5250-5350, 5470-5650,
and 5725-5825 MHz band respectively

\- Antenna gain assumed:

\- 6 dBi for 5150-5250 and 5725-5825MHz band

\- 7 dBi for 52505350 and 5470-5650MHz band

\- Out of Band Emission (EIRP (dBm/MHz) )

\- \<-27 dBm/MHz

\- DFS & TPC

\- DFS is defined for 5250-5350MHz and 5470-5650MHz

\- TPC is defined for 5250-5350MHz and 5470-5650MHz

\- TPC ensures wireless devices with average Tx power including antenna
gain larger than 25mW/MHz can reduce its average Tx power by at least
3dB (below 12.5mW/MHz)

\- Maximum bandwidth occupancy

\- \< 80MHz for 5GHz

\- Maximum power spectral density for bandwidth aggregation (contiguous
or non-contiguous)

\- Among 5150-5250, 5250-5350, 5470-5650, and 5725-5825 MHz bands,
multiple of 80MHz bandwidth can be aggregated in contiguous or
non-contiguous manner to form 160MHz bandwidth

\- In this case, maximum power spectral density for 5150-5250MHz should
be lower than 0.625mW/MHz while it should be lower than 1.25mW/Hz in the
other bands

\- Modulation scheme

\- Digital modulation for 5GHz

\- Difference from FCC regulation

\- Maximum transmission power in case of 5725 to 5825MHz is still 200mW
for 20MHz bandwidth (a bit lower compared to 1W power in UNII-3)

\- 5825-5850MHz is not for WAS (Wireless Access System)

#### 4.1.3.4 India

In India the bands 5150-5250 MHz, 5250-5350 MHz, 5570-5725 MHz and
5725-5875 MHz are open to RLANs \[22\], \[35\], \[36\], \[37\]. Table
4.1.3.4-1 and Table 4.1.3.4-2 summarize regulatory requirements in India
for indoor and outdoor deployments respectively. Some parts of the 5 GHz
band shall follow usage \"on non-interference, non-protection and shared
(non-exclusive) basis\". These are the 5725-5825 MHz band open to
licensed WAS including RLANs, and the 5150-5350 MHz and 5725-5875 MHz
bands open for unlicensed WAS including RLANs for indoor deployment.

#### 4.1.3.5 Taiwan

In Taiwan the bands 5250-5350 MHz, 5470-5600 MHz, 5650-5725 MHz and
5725-5850 MHz are allocated to RLANs \[22\]\[40\]. Table 4.1.3.5-1 and
Table 4.1.3.5-2 summarize the current regulatory requirements for
transmit power and DFS in Taiwan \[40\]. DFS is mandate for 5470-5725
MHz \[41\]. Recently, work for specifying requirements for allowing
RLANs in 5150-5250 MHz and 5600-5650 MHz has started but the detailed
regulatory requirements for this has not yet been specified.
Additionally specification work for allowing 5250-5350 MHz outdoor has
started, this assumes that DFS will be performed, but detailed
requirements are not yet defined.

#### 4.1.3.6 Singapore

In Singapore the bands 5150-5250 MHz, 5250-5350 MHz, 5470-5725MHz and
5725-5850 MHz are open to RLANs.

#### 4.1.3.7 Australia

In Australia the band bands 5150-5250 MHz, 5250-5350 MHz and 5470-5725
MHz, except the sub-band 5600-5650 MHz, are open to RLANs. DFS and TPC
are mandatory in the bands 5250-5350 MHz and 5470-5725 MHz.

### 4.1.4 Applicability of DFS requirements

The concept surfaced around 2001 in the ECC for handling uniform spread
of WLAN interference into satellite and radar services, but was soon
extended to include methods for discovery and avoidance of frequencies
used by the radar service in the preparation work for WRC 2003.

Use of DFS in accordance with Annex 1 of ITU-R Recommendation M.1652
\[39\] is mandated as per Resolution 229 \[38\]. The 5 GHz Harmonized
European Standard developed by ETSI TC BRAN was the first to include
these DFS rules (EN 301 893 V1.2.3 in 2003), the DFS test specification
included in this standard therefore became the basis for the development
of the FCC DFS test specification and other test specifications in other
countries.

For NR-U, it appears that conformance testing would only have to be
performed for the BS. Already at the outset in ITU-R M.1652 it was made
clear that full DFS functionality may not have to be implemented in all
devices, only those controlling the transmission \[39\]:

**2.1 Detection requirements**

The DFS mechanism should be able to detect interference signals above a
minimum DFS detection threshold of --62 dBm for devices with a maximum
e.i.r.p. of \< 200 mW and --64 dBm for devices with a maximum e.i.r.p.
of 200 mW to 1 W^3^ averaged over 1 μs.

This is defined as the received signal strength (RSS) (dBm), normalized
to the output of a 0 dBi receive antenna, that is required to be
detected within the WAS channel bandwidth.

**2.2 Operational**

with the footnote 3 stating:

In practice, it may not be necessary for each device to implement full
DFS functionality, provided that such devices are only able to transmit
under the control of a device that ensures that all DFS requirements are
fulfilled.

This is reflected in both regulation for Europe and the Part 15 rules by
the FCC. The harmonized ETSI BRAN standard cited in the EC commission
rules is also followed by many other countries outside Europe.

#### 4.1.4.1 DFS according to ECC

In accordance with the ECC Decision \[10\], \"Every Master Device will
use the Radar Interference Detection function in order to check for any
co-channel radar signal prior to use a channel but also during normal
operation. In addition to this Radar Interference Detection function,
every Master Device shall also implement a channel selection mechanism
to ensure a near uniform spread of the loading of available spectrum.\"
In the latest version of the EN 301 893 \[5\], the applicability of the
DFS requirements is listed as follows:

Table 5 lists the DFS related technical requirements and their
applicability for every operational mode. If the RLAN device is capable
of operating in more than one operational mode then every operating mode
shall be assessed separately.

The radar detection requirements specified in clauses 4.7.2.2 to 4.7.2.4
assume that the centre frequencies of the radar signals fall within the
central 80 % of the *Occupied Channel Bandwidth* of the RLAN channel
(see clause 4.3).

Notice also the assumption that the radar signal falls within 80% of the
occupied bandwidth, which is linked to the requirements on occupied
emission bandwidth in EN 801 893 (clause 4.7).

#### 4.1.4.2 DFS in the Part 15 rules

The rules with regard to implementation of DFS functionality are similar
in the Part 15 rules \[3\]; the required functionality is limited for
the slave,

> \(2\) Radar Detection Function of Dynamic Frequency Selection (DFS).
> U-NII devices operating with any part of its 26 dB emission bandwidth
> in the 5.25-5.35 GHz and 5.47-5.725 GHz bands shall employ a DFS radar

> and slave operational modes.
>
> \(ii\) Channel Availability Check Time. A U-NII device shall check if
> there is a radar system already operating on the channel before it can

>
> \(iii\) Channel Move Time. After a radar\'s presence is detected, all
> transmissions shall cease on the operating channel within 10 seconds.
> Transmissions during this period shall consist of normal traffic for a
> maximum of 200 ms after detection of the radar signal. In addition,
> intermittent management and control signals can be sent during the
> remaining time to facilitate vacating the operating channel.

Similar to the ETSI BRAN harmonized standard, there is also a
requirement that \"the device must sense for radar signals at 100
percent of its emission bandwidth\". In deriving the minimum DFS
detection threshold for the WAS receiver, it was assumed that above this
threshold the emissions within the RLAN bandwidth would desensitize the
radar receiver. Reciprocity was thus assumed, the WAS should be able to
detect a radar within its emission bandwidth. The bandwidth of the WAS
affects the probability of detecting a radar signal and its side lobes
and the probability of causing interference (the WAS emissions).

4.2 Regulatory requirements for 6GHz band
-----------------------------------------

Currently, CEPT and FCC have started initiatives to investigate
potentialities for deployment of IMT services in the 5.925-7.125 GHz
frequency range (e.g. US 5925 -- 7125 MHz, or European 5925 -- 6425 MHz,
or parts thereof), with considerations for all or part of this range
being made available for unlicensed operation \[32\].

5 Spectrum considerations 
=========================

For the NR-U study item, different unlicensed bands or shared bands have
been discussed, such as 2.4 GHz band, 3.5 GHz band, 5 GHz band, and 6
GHz band. Some bands are available globally and some bands are only
available in some specific regions, and some bands may be made available
after the completion of this study \[32\].

Follow the NR design principles, from RAN1 design perspective, this NR-U
study is not limited to a particular unlicensed band. Instead, the
target NR-U design is applicable to a set of frequency ranges to be
further defined. There is no prioritization between unlicensed bands. On
the other hand, the NR-U study does not target sub-1 GHz unlicensed
bands, due to the lack of spectrum in the band to support efficient NR-U
operation.

6 Deployment scenarios 
======================

This section describes possible deployment scenarios for NR-U.

Five deployment scenarios have been identified:

\- Scenario A: Carrier aggregation between licensed band NR (PCell) and
NR-U (SCell)

> \- NR-U SCell may have both DL and UL, or DL-only.

\- Scenario B: Dual connectivity between licensed band LTE (PCell) and
NR-U (PSCell)

\- Scenario C: Stand-alone NR-U

\- Scenario D: An NR cell with DL in unlicensed band and UL in licensed
band

\- Scenario E: Dual connectivity between licensed band NR (PCell) and
NR-U (PSCell)

7 Design targets, functionalities and solutions
===============================================

In the discussions in the NR-U study item, references to sub-7 GHz are
intended to include unlicensed bands in the 6 GHz region that are being
discussed in regulatory discussions which may have some region exceeding
7 GHz (e.g., 7.125 GHz).

7.1 Design targets and functionalities
--------------------------------------

The NR-U study targets identification of additional functionality needed
for a PHY layer design (except channel access procedures) for operation
in unlicensed spectrum that may be applicable over a particular
frequency range (e.g., sub-7 GHz, 7-52.6 GHz, \> 52.6 GHz). The
definition of the frequency ranges is to be further defined. On the
other hand, the optimizations for a particular frequency band may be
necessary due to different requirements, such as PSD limitation or OCB
requirement, for each band. Channel bandwidths below 5 MHz are not
targeted in this study.

The study targets the design of channel access procedures for frequency
bands based on coexistence and regulatory considerations applicable to
the band. The study includes identification of procedures for technology
neutral channel access for frequency bands that may become available
subject to regulations. The study assumes regulation will provide the
framework concerning the protection for the technologies not using
unlicensed access in those bands.

7.2 Solutions for operation in unlicensed spectrum
--------------------------------------------------

### 7.2.1 Physical layer aspects

According to the study item description \[30\], physical channels
inheriting the choices of duplex mode, waveform, carrier bandwidth,
subcarrier spacing, frame structure, and physical layer design made as
part of the NR study and avoiding unnecessary divergence with decisions
made in the NR WI.

NR-U supports both Type-A and Type-B mapping already supported in NR.

Initial active DL/UL BWP is approximately 20MHz for 5GHz band, though
the final value will be quantized to number of PRBs. Initial active
DL/UL BWP is approximately 20MHz for 6GHz band if similar channelization
as 5GHz band is used for 6GHz band.

#### 7.2.1.1 Frame structure

Single and multiple DL to UL and UL to DL switching points within a
shared gNB COT is identified to be beneficial and can be supported. LBT
requirements to support single or multiple switching points has been
identified (Section 7.2.1.3.1).

For NR-U DL operation, it is identified that being able to operate all
DL signal/channels with the same numerology for a carrier and at least
for intra-band CA on serving cells on unlicensed bands has at least the
following benefits (at least for standalone operation)

\- Lower implementation complexity (e.g., a single FFT, no switching
gaps)

\- Lower specification impact

\- No need for gaps for measurements on frequencies with a configured
serving cell in unlicensed bands

For NR-U UL operation, it is identified that being able to operate all
UL signal/channels (except PRACH) with the same numerology for a carrier
and at least for intra-band CA on serving cells on unlicensed bands has
at least the following benefits:

\- Lower implementation complexity (e.g., a single FFT, no switching
gaps)

\- Lower specification impact

\- Common interlace structure

\- No need for gaps for transmission of SRS on a configured serving cell
in unlicensed bands

For unlicensed PCell, the UE assumes single SSB numerology per band.

It has been identified to be beneficial for the NR-U design to not
require the gNB to change a pre-determined TBS for a PDSCH transmission
depending on the LBT outcome, at least when the PDSCH is transmitted at
the beginning of the gNB\'s COT.

The following options have been identified as possible candidates for
PDSCH transmission in the partial slot at least for the first PDSCH(s)
transmitted in the DL transmission burst. The options are not mutually
exclusive.

\- Option 1: PDSCH(s) as in Rel-15 NR

\- Option 2: Punctured PDSCH depending on LBT outcome

\- Option 3: PDSCH mapping type B with durations other than 2/4/7
symbols

\- Option 4: PDSCH across slot boundary

In addition to the functionalities provided by DCI format 2\_0 in Rel-15
NR, indication of the COT structure in the time domain has been
identified as being beneficial.

It has been identified to be beneficial for the NR-U design to not
require the UE to change a granted TBS for a PUSCH transmission
depending on the LBT outcome.

The following options have been identified as possible candidate at
least for the first PUSCH(s) transmitted in the UL transmission burst.

\- Option 1: PUSCH(s) as in Rel-15 NR

\- Option 2: Multiple starting positions in one or multiple slot(s) are
allowed for PUSCH(s) scheduled by a single UL grant (i.e., not a
configured grant) and one of the multiple PUSCH starting positions can
be decided depending on LBT outcome.

It is noted that for above options, the ending position of the PUSCH is
fixed as indicated by the UL grant.

It is noted that above options are not mutually exclusive.

It has been identified that FBE operation for the scenario where it is
guaranteed that LBE nodes are absent on a long term basis (e.g., by
level of regulation) and FBE gNBs are synchronized can achieve the
following: Ability to use frequency reuse factor 1; Lower complexity for
channel access due to lack of necessity to perform random backoff.

It is noted that this does not imply that LBE does not have benefits in
similar scenarios although there are differences between the two modes
of operation. It is also noted that FBE may also have some disadvantages
compared to other modes of operation such as LBE, e.g., a fixed overhead
for idle time during a frame.

For wideband operation for both DL and UL,

\- Bandwidth larger than 20 MHz can be supported with multiple serving
cells.

\- NR-U should support that a serving cell can be configured with
bandwidth larger than 20 MHz.

For DL operation, the following options for BWP-based operation within a
carrier with bandwidth larger than 20 MHz can be considered.

\- Option 1a: Multiple BWPs configured, multiple BWPs activated,
transmission of PDSCH on one or more BWPs

\- Option 1b: Multiple BWPs configured, multiple BWPs activated,
transmission of PDSCH on single BWP

\- Option 2: Multiple BWPs can be configured, single BWP activated, gNB
transmits PDSCH on a single BWP if CCA is successful at gNB for the
whole BWP

\- Option 3: Multiple BWPs can be configured, single BWP activated, gNB
transmits PDSCH on parts or whole of single BWP where CCA is successful
at gNB

For UL operation, the following options for BWP-based operation within a
carrier with bandwidth larger than 20 MHz can be considered.

\- Option 1a: Multiple BWPs configured, multiple BWPs activated,
transmission of PUSCH on one or more BWPs

\- Option 1b: Multiple BWPs configured, multiple BWPs activated,
transmission of PUSCH on single BWP

\- Option 2: Multiple BWPs can be configured, single BWP activated, UE
transmits PUSCH on a single BWP if CCA is successful at UE for the whole
BWP

\- Option 3: Multiple BWPs can be configured, single BWP activated, UE
transmits PUSCH on parts or whole of single BWP where CCA is successful
at UE

It is noted that CCA is declared to be successful or not in multiples of
20 MHz.

Detailed design and potential selection from the above options can be
further discussed when specifications are developed considering protocol
and RF aspects.

#### 7.2.1.2 Physical layer channel designs

For physical layer channel design, NR design will be used as baseline,
and the following potential design changes are to be studied to support
the following channels/signals in NR-U.

\- PDCCH/PDSCH

\- PUCCH/PUSCH

\- PSS/SSS/PBCH

\- PRACH

\- DL and UL reference signals applicable to the operational frequency
range

For SS/PBCH block transmission, extended CP is not supported for NR-U
operation.

For PSS/SSS/PBCH transmission, NR-U should have a signal that contains
at least SS/PBCH block burst set transmission. The design of this signal
should consider the following characteristics specific to unlicensed
band operation:

\- There are no gaps within the time span the signal is transmitted at
least within a beam

\- The occupied channel bandwidth is satisfied (although this may not be
a requirement)

\- Strive to minimize the channel occupancy time of the signal

\- Characteristics that may facilitate fast channel access

Inclusion of the CSI-RS and RMSI-CORESET(s)+PDSCH(s) (carrying RMSI)
associated with SS/PBCH block(s) in addition to the SS/PBCH burst set in
one contiguous burst (referred to as the NR-U DRS) can be beneficial for

\- Meeting OCB requirement

\- Compacting signals in time domain to limit the required number of
channel access and for short channel occupancy

\- Support of stand-alone NR-U deployments

\- Support of automatic neighbour relations (ANR) functionality in an
NR-U deployment

\- Resolution of PCI confusion in an NR-U deployment

The transmission of additional signals such as OSI and paging within the
NR-U DRS is allowed and can be beneficial.

Support of Pattern 1 is recommended for multiplexing of SS/PBCH block(s)
and CORESET(s)\#0 in NR-U, where Pattern 1 is understood as CORESET\#0
and an SS/PBCH block occuring in different time instances, and the
CORESET\#0 bandwidth overlaping with the transmission bandwidth of the
SS/PBCH block.

As one element to facilitate a NR-U DRS design without gaps in the time
domain, the CORESET\#0 configuration(s) and/or Type0-PDCCH common search
space configuration(s) may need enhancements compared to NR Rel-15, such
as additional time domain configurations of the common search space(s).

The detection of a gNB\'s transmission burst by the UE has been studied,
and concerns on the UE power consumption required for Tx burst detection
e.g. if the UE needs to frequently detect/monitor the PDCCH have been
raised. The proposals that have been made by contributions regarding
these topics include existing NR signal(s) with potential
enhancement(s), a channel such as PDCCH with potential enhancement(s),
and the 802.11a/802.11ax preamble with potential enhancement(s);
consensus was not achieved on any of these proposals. The
detection/decoding reliability of each of the proposals has not been
sufficiently evaluated for a complete evaluation of the proposals
against each other. The power consumption and detection/decoding
complexity of each of the proposals have not been sufficiently evaluated
for a complete evaluation of the proposals against each other. The
relation of a proposal with C-DRX and/or measurement gap(s) may need
further consideration when specifications are being developed.

Compared to NR Rel-15, it has been identified to be beneficial if the
time domain instances in which the UE is expected to receive PDCCH can
change dynamically, e.g. by implicit determination related to the gNB\'s
COT, or explicitly signalled by the gNB.

For UL waveform for PUSCH, PUCCH, and PRACH, it has been identified that
an interlaced waveform can have benefits in some scenarios including
link budget limited cases with given PSD constraint, and as one option
to efficiently meet the occupied channel bandwidth requirement.

On the other hand, it is RAN1\'s understanding that the temporal
allowance of not meeting occupied channel bandwidth by regulation can be
exploited if the minimum bandwidth requirement, e.g., 2 MHz, is
satisfied. Therefore, a waveform contiguous in frequency may be adequate
in some scenarios, which implies that Release 15 NR contiguous
allocation designs can be used for NR-U as well.

Support for Rel-15 NR PUSCH can be considered. However, it has been
identified that block-interlaced based PUSCH can be beneficial.

Support for Rel-15 NR PUCCH formats can be considered, however, not
necessarily all Release 15 NR PUCCH formats are applicable to NR-U. It
has been identified that legacy PUCCH formats PF2 and PF3 are beneficial
for NR-U for the scenario of contiguous allocations due to the fact that
they may be configured with bandwidth that meets the minimum temporal
allowance of 2 MHz (12/6/3 PRBs for 15/30/60 kHz SCS). It has been
identified that legacy PUCCH formats PF0/1/4 are not well-suited for
NR-U for the scenario of contiguous allocations since they support only
single PRB.

When new block interlace waveform for PUCCH is to be defined, it is
beneficial to use the same block interlace structure for PUCCH and
PUSCH.

It has been identified that enhancement of one or more legacy PUCCH
formats is feasible to support block interlaced PUCCH transmission.
There is consensus that enhanced PUCCH with both short and long duration
is beneficial for NR-U; however, no consensus has been achieved about
which legacy PUCCH format(s) should be the starting point for an
enhanced PUCCH design. Some sources suggest introducing just one or two
new enhanced PUCCH formats, while other sources suggest enhancing all or
almost all legacy PUCCH formats (PF0,1,2,3,4). Regardless of which
format(s) is(are) chosen as a starting point for enhancement, the
following common aspects have been identified as important to consider
in the detailed design of the enhanced PUCCH format(s) when
specifications are developed:

\- Flexible number of OFDM symbols

\- Short duration, e.g., 1 or 2 OFDM symbols

\- Long duration, e.g., 4 -- 14 OFDM symbols

\- Flexible UCI payload

\- Small payload, e.g., 1 or 2 bit

\- Larger payloads, e.g., \> 2 bits

\- Coding of UCI payload, e.g.,

\- Extend legacy (NR Rel-15) PUCCH encoder to handle small payloads

\- Repetition of coded UCI bits across PRBs of an interlace

\- UCI Codebits over all PRBs, i.e. no repetition coding.

\- Number of supported PUCCH formats

\- Support for user multiplexing of both UCI payload and DMRS on an
interlace, e.g.,

\- OCCs

\- Cyclic shifts

\- FDM within an interlace

\- Multiplexing method of UCI payload and DMRS, e.g,

\- TDM

\- FDM

\- Mechanism to control PAPR, e.g.,

\- OCC cycling

\- Bit level processing

\- PRB level processing

\- Sequence hopping

\- PUCCH waveform, e.g.,

\- CP-OFDM

\- DFT-s-OFDM

\- Performance, e.g.,

\- Required SNR to achieve a target BLER

\- Required SNR to achieve target ACK to NACK rate, NACK to ACK rate and
DTX to ACK rate

\- Coverage considering CM/PAPR

Support for Rel-15 NR PRACH formats can be considered, however, not
necessarily all Release 15 NR PRACH formats are applicable to NR-U. It
is RAN1\'s understanding that certain formats do not meet the minimum
bandwidth requirement by regulation. Exclusion of the support of certain
formats is to be identified.

It is identified that interlaced based PRACH can be beneficial.

It has been identified that enhancement of one or more legacy PRACH
formats is feasible for NR-U. Four potential design alternatives,
including no interlacing, have been identified for the frequency mapping
of PRACH sequences for NR-U, where consensus on which one(s) to support
for NR-U has not yet been achieved:

\- Alt-1: Uniform PRB-level interlace mapping

\- In this approach a PRACH sequence for a particular PRACH occasion is
mapped to all of the PRBs of one or more of the interlaces in the
PRB-based block interlace structure. Within a PRB, either all or a
subset of REs are used. Different PRACH occasions are defined using an
orthogonal set of PRBs, or an orthogonal set of REs within the PRBs,
from one or more same/different interlaces.

\- It has been identified that a uniform mapping (equal spacing of PRBs)
in the frequency domain produces a zero-autocorrelation zone, of which
the duration is inversely proportional to the frequency spacing between
the PRBs.

\- Alt-2: Non-uniform PRB-level interlace mapping

\- In this approach a PRACH sequence for a particular PRACH occasion is
mapped to some or all of the PRBs of one or more of the interlaces in
the same PRB-based block interlace structure used for PUSCH/PUCCH.
Within a PRB, either all or a subset of REs are used. Different PRACH
occasions are defined using an orthogonal set of PRBs, or an orthogonal
set of REs within the PRBs, from one or more same/different interlaces.

\- It has been identified that an irregular mapping (non-equal spacing
of PRBs/REs) in the frequency domain reduces the false peaks in the
PRACH preamble auto-correlation function.

\- Alt-3: Uniform RE-level interlace mapping

\- In this approach, a PRACH sequence for a particular PRACH occasion
consists of a \"comb-like\" mapping in the frequency domain with equal
spacing between all used REs. Different PRACH occasions are defined by
way of different comb offsets.

\- Since this approach does not fit with the common PUSCH/PUCCH
interlace structure, one source suggests that only TDM multiplexing of
PUSCH/PUCCH and PRACH should be supported. Another source suggests that
puncturing/rate matching PUSCH/PUCCH around the used PRACH REs may be
used.

\- Alt-4: Non-interlaced mapping

\- In this approach, a PRACH sequence for a particular PRACH occasion is
mapped to a number of contiguous PRBs, same or similar to NR Rel-15.

\- Some sources propose that to fulfill the minimum OCB requirement,
that the PRACH sequence is mapped to a set of contiguous PRBs, and the
PRACH sequence mapping is repeated across the frequency domain,
potentially with guard RE(s)/PRB(s) between repetitions. For each
repetition, a different cyclic shift or different base sequence may or
may not be applied.

It has been identified that the long PRACH sequence length defined in NR
Rel-15 (L = 839) is not beneficial for NR-U, since PRACH formats based
on this length are tailored toward large cells not expected in an NR-U
deployment. However, when it comes to shorter sequence lengths, some
sources propose reusing the short sequence length (L = 139) defined in
NR-Rel-15, whereas other sources propose defining new sequence lengths
depending on which of the 4 alternatives above is supported.

It has been identified that the following common design attributes need
to be considered in the detailed design of an interlaced PRACH waveform
for 4-step random access for NR-U when specifications are developed:

\- Multiplexing of PRACH and PUSCH/PUCCH, considering block interlaced
structure used for PUSCH/PUCCH, e.g.,

\- FDM

\- TDM

\- Supported PRACH sequence and PRACH sequence length(s)

\- PRACH capacity

\- Number of PRACH preambles per cell

\- Number of root sequences

\- Number of cyclic shifts

\- Number of PRACH occasions

\- Maximum supported Tx power

\- PAPR/CM

\- Number of PRACH formats

\- Simulation assumptions for evaluation of performance, e.g.,

\- Single vs. multi-cell assumptions

\- Performance metrics

\- Timing estimation error

\- Miss-detection probability

\- False-detection probability

\- False-alarm probability

For scenarios in which a block-interlaced waveform is used for
PUCCH/PUSCH, it has been identified that from FDM-based
user-multiplexing standpoint it can be beneficial to have UL channels on
a common interlace structure, at least for PUSCH, PUCCH, associated
DMRS, and potentially PRACH

On the other hand, for scenarios in which a contiguous allocation for
PUSCH and PUCCH is used, it is beneficial to use contiguous resource
allocation for PRACH

For scenarios in which a block-interlaced waveform is used for UL
transmission, a PRB-based block-interlace design has been identified as
beneficial at least for 15 and 30 kHz SCS, and potentially for 60 kHz
SCS. One identified benefit is better link budget with given PSD
constraint. However, it has been observed that power boosting gains
decrease with increasing SCS. Another identified benefit is as one
option to efficiently meet the occupied channel bandwidth requirement.
Compared with sub-PRB interlace design, the PRB-based block-interlace
design has comparatively less specification impact.

For sub-PRB block interlace designs, in some scenarios, sub-PRB block
interlacing can be beneficial in terms of power boosting. However, the
sub-PRB block interlace design has at least the following specification
impacts: Reference signal design (e.g., DMRS); Channel estimation
aspects; Resource allocation.

Both PRB and sub-PRB interlacing for 60 kHz have been studied. For
sub-PRB interlacing the following aspects have been considered:

\- Power boosting potential depending on resource allocation size

\- PUSCH DMRS configuration aspects

\- Channel estimation performance

\- Number of REs per interlace unit

It has been identified as beneficial to support a block-interlaced
structure in which the number of interlaces (M) decreases with
increasing SCS, and the nominal number of PRBs per interlace (N) is
similar for each SCS (in a given bandwidth) at least for 15 and 30 kHz
SCS, and potentially 60 kHz depending on supported interlace design.

From a RAN1 perspective it has been identified that supporting a
non-uniform interlace structure in which the number of PRBs per
interlace is allowed to be different for different interlaces is
beneficial from a spectrum utilization point of view. It is up to RAN4
to investigate whether or not the non-uniform interlace structure has an
impact on MPR/A-MPR requirements for PUSCH.

Within a 20 MHz bandwidth, the following candidate PRB-based interlace
designs have been identified where M is the number of interlaces and N
is the number of PRBs per interlace in a 20 MHz bandwidth. Where two
values are listed for N, it means that some interlaces have one more PRB
than others (non-uniform interlace design)

For carriers with bandwidth larger than 20 MHz, two candidate interlace
designs have been identified:

\- Alt-1: Same interlace spacing for all interlaces regardless of
carrier BW. This alternative uses Point A as a reference for the
interlace definition

\- Alt-2: Interlacing defined on a sub-band (20 MHz) basis. (Note:
Possible interlace spacing discontinuity at edges of sub-band).

Additional candidates have been identified, but consensus has not been
achieved, e.g., (1) for carriers with bandwidth larger than 20 MHz,
retain the same number of PRBs per interlace (N) for all interlaces
regardless of carrier BW; (2) Partial interlace allocation. Detailed
design can be further discussed when specifications are developed taking
RF aspects into account.

It has been identified that support of different numerology candidates
at least has the following specification impacts:

\- For PRB-based block-interlace design for 15, 30, and 60 kHz SCS, the
following spec impacts have been identified: Number of interlaces and
number of PRBs per interlace need to be defined; the resource allocation
mechanism needs to be defined; channel estimation aspects need to be
considered, such as impact on PRG. In addition to the above impact, for
sub-PRB-based block-interlace design for 60 kHz SCS, reference signal
design (such as DMRS) needs to be revisited and alternative resource
allocation mechanism is needed.

\- For NR-U DRS design for 15 and 30 kHz SCS, the SS/PBCH block time
domain pattern is already supported in Rel-15. For 60 kHz SCS, there is
no SS/PBCH block time domain pattern defined in Rel-15. SS/PBCH block to
CORESET configuration tables (38.213 Section 13) need to be defined as
well.

\- For PRACH design for 15, 30, and 60 kHz SCS, signalling mechanism of
RACH configuration indicating PRACH numerology may need modification to
support more than two numerologies for PRACH for NR-U.

It has been identified as beneficial for NR-U to introduce additional
flexibility in configuring/triggering SRS compared to NR Rel-15. The
following candidate enhancements have been discussed; design details can
be further discussed when specifications are developed:

\- Additional OFDM symbol locations for an SRS resource within a slot
other than the last 6 symbols

\- Interlaced waveform

\- Additional flexibility in frequency domain configuration

It may be beneficial to apply restrictions on the use of DFT-s-OFDM in
NR-U to avoid significant design efforts specific to operation in
unlicensed spectrum.

#### 7.2.1.3 Physical layer procedure designs

##### 7.2.1.3.1 Channel access procedures

If absence of Wi-Fi cannot be guaranteed (e.g. by regulation) in the
band (sub-7 GHz) where NR-U is operating, the baseline assumption is,
the NR-U operating bandwidth is an integer multiple of 20MHz.

Channel access mechanisms need to comply with regulations and may
therefore need to be adapted for particular frequency ranges.

For channel access mechanism, LTE-LAA LBT mechanism is adopted as
baseline for 5GHz band and adopted as the starting point of the design
for 6GHz band. At least for band where absence of Wi-Fi cannot be
guaranteed (e.g. by regulation), LBT can be performed in units of 20
MHz.

For 5GHz band, having a 16 µs gap to accommodate for the transceiver
turnaround before the immediate transmission of the responding node is
beneficial for NR-U, such as for supporting fast A/N feedback, and is
permitted per regulation. Restrictions/conditions on when this option
can be used will be further identified, e.g., in consideration of fair
coexistence.

A 16 µs gap to accommodate for the transceiver turnaround before the
immediate transmission of the responding node can also be applied to
6GHz band if allowed by regulation, and restrictions/conditions on when
this option can be used will be further identified, if fair coexistence
criterion is defined for 6GHz band.

For CWS adjustment procedure in NR-U, in addition to aspects considered
in LTE LAA, NR-U may additionally consider at least the following
aspects: CBG based HARQ-ACK operation, NR scheduling and HARQ-feedback
delays and processing times, wideband (\>20 MHz) operation including
BWPs, Configured grant operation.For initiation of a COT by the gNB
(operating as an LBE device), the channel access schemes in Table
7.2.1.3.1-1 are used.

Table 7.2.1.3.1-1: Channel access schemes for initiating a COT by gNB as
LBE device

                                                                           Cat 2 LBT                                                                                                  Cat 4 LBT

  PDCCH and PDSCH                                                          N/A except for the cases discussed in the Note below                                                       Channel access priority class is selected according to the multiplexed data

Note: Applicability of an LBT scheme other than Cat 4 LBT for control
messages related to initial/random access, mobility, paging, reference
signals only, and PDCCH-only transmissions, e.g. \"RACH message 4\",
handover command, GC-PDCCH, or short message paging transmitted either
alone or when multiplexed with DRS have been discussed. Further details
related to exceptions in this note can be determined when specifications
are developed.

At least for the case where a DL burst follows a UL burst within a
gNB-initiated COT and there is no gap larger than 25 µs between any two
transmissions in the COT, the channel access schemes in Table
7.2.1.3.1-2 apply for the DL burst following a UL burst.

Note: a DL burst is defined as a set of transmissions from a given gNB
having no gaps or gaps of no more than 16 µs. Transmissions from a gNB
having a gap of more than 16 µs are considered as separate DL bursts.

Within a gNB-initiated COT, an UL burst for a UE consisting of one or
more of PUSCH, PUCCH, PRACH, and SRS follows the channel access schemes
in Table 7.2.1.3.1-3.

Note: An UL burst is defined as a set of transmissions from a given UE
having no gaps or gaps of no more than 16 µs. Transmissions from a UE
having a gap of more than 16 µs are considered as separate UL bursts.
The number of LBT attempts within a COT should be determined when
specifications are developed.

For initiation of a COT by the UE, the channel access schemes in Table
7.2.1.3.1-4 are used.

Table 7.2.1.3.1-4: Channel access schemes for initiating a COT by UE as
LBE device

  RACH-only                                                (see Note 2)                                         Cat4 with lowest channel access priority class value
  PUCCH-only                                               (see Note 2)                                         Cat4 with lowest channel access priority class value

Note 1: If the COT includes multiple signals/channels with different
channel access categories / priority classes, the highest channel access
priority class value and highest channel access category among the
channel access priority classes and channel access categories
corresponding to the multiple signals/channels applies.

Note 2: Applicability of a channel access scheme other than Cat 4 for
the following signals / channels have been discussed and details are to
be determined when the specifications are developed:

\- UL control information including UCI only on PUSCH, e.g. HARQ-ACK,
Scheduling Request, and Channel State Information

\- Random Access

For FBE mode of operation, gNB acquires COT with Cat2 immediately prior
to the fixed frame period. Within the gNB acquired COT, if a gap is \<=
16 μs, Cat 1 channel access scheme can be used by the gNB and associated
UEs. Within the gNB acquired COT, if a gap is \> 16 μs, Cat 2 channel
access scheme should be used by the gNB and associated UEs. Note this
channel access mechanisms are intended to be aligned with any
regulations for FBE operation.

Means to reduce or mitigate the impact of interference e.g. from hidden
nodes with UE assistance have been studied. Possible mechanisms include
at least enhancements to L1 measurement and reporting of interference
observed by a UE, and handshaking procedures between transmitter and the
receiver. Further consideration is required regarding the detailed
solutions and their benefits for mitigation of impact of interference on
NR-U when the specifications are to be developed.

Means to facilitate spatial reuse, or frequency reuse 1 operation of
NR-U have been studied. Possible mechanisms include at least: alignment
of starting points for transmission (and consequently time instances for
at least the last CCA); exchange and coordination of LBT related
parameters amongst different NR-U gNBs or UEs; means to determine
whether interference originates from other NR-U nodes; enhancements to
L1 measurement and reporting of interference observed by a UE; and
adjustment of energy/signal detection thresholds. Further consideration
is required regarding the detailed solutions and their benefits for
facilitating spatial reuse in NR-U when the specifications are to be
developed, taking into account regulations.

Channel access mechanisms for beamformed transmissions have been
studied. It has been identified that omni-directional LBT should be
supported. Using directional LBT for beamformed transmissions, i.e. LBT
performed in the direction of the transmitted beam has also been
studied. Further consideration is required regarding directional LBT and
its benefits for beamformed transmissions when the specifications are to
be developed, taking into account regulations and fair co-existence with
other technologies.

##### 7.2.1.3.2 Initial access and mobility

For initial access and mobility procedures, the main issue identified
for NR operation in unlicensed band is the reduced transmission
opportunities for different signals and channels due to LBT failure.

The following modifications to initial access procedures have been
identified as beneficial:

\- Modifications to initial access procedures considering limitations on
access to the channel based on LBT. NR-U needs to develop techniques to
handle reduced SS/PBCH block and RMSI transmission opportunities due to
LBT failure.

\- Enhancement to 4-step RACH, including developing mechanisms to handle
reduced msg 1/2/3/4 transmission opportunities due to LBT failure.

It is also identified that a 2-step RACH procedure potentially has
benefit for channel access.

For SS/PBCH block transmission, it is recommended to define a mechanism
to transmit SS/PBCH blocks dropped due to LBT failure. It is also
recommended to define a mechanism when specifications are developed for
UE(s) to determine the frame timing and QCL assumptions from the
detected SS/PBCH block. The feasibility and benefits of beam repetition
for soft combining reception of SSBs within the same DRS transmission
may be further considered.

For SS/PBCH block transmissions as part of DRS, it is considered
beneficial to expand the maximum number of candidate SS/PBCH block
positions within the DRS transmission window to Y, for e.g., Y ≤ 64,
where the choice of Y may depend on the numerology of the SS/PBCH
blocks. The transmitted SS/PBCH blocks do not overlap and the maximum
number of transmitted SS/PBCH blocks is X within DRS transmission window
with X ≤ 8. The time-domain positions of the actually transmitted
SS/PBCH blocks are selected from a set of Y candidate SS/PBCH block
positions. Proposals for shift granularity between candidate time domain
SSB positions/candidate groups of SSBs, duration of DRS transmission
window, and duration of the transmitted DRS within the window including
SSBs and other multiplexed signals/channels, were discussed without
reaching consensus, and can be considered further when specifications
are developed.

Modifications to paging procedures due to reduced transmission
opportunities for paging due to LBT failure are beneficial and have been
identified and studied. It is therefore considered beneficial to enhance
paging opportunities using the following mechanism:

\- Increased time-domain paging occasions or paging monitoring
occasions.

\- This can enable additional paging occasions outside of DRS.

Note: Parts or all of the above enhancement may fall under the purview
of higher-layer enhancements and may not require any further study from
a L1 perspective

For potential RACH resource enhancements, the following options have
been identified for NR-U, beyond the flexibility already available in
Rel-15, but consensus was not achieved. These options may be further
considered when specifications are developed:

\- Frequency-domain enhancement: Multiple PRACH resources across
multiple LBT sub-bands/carriers for both contention-free and
contention-based RA

\- Time-domain enhancements:

\- For connected mode UE, scheduling of PRACH resources via DCI.

\- Triggered PRACH within gNB acquired COT can use a new resource
indicated by the DCI

\- For idle mode UE, scheduling of PRACH resources via paging

\- Note: potential inefficiency in network resource due to paging across
multiple cells

\- Additional, new RACH resources are used immediately following
detection of DRS transmission

\- Multiple PRACH transmissions before Msg2 reception in RAR window for
initial access

\- Number of allowed transmissions is pre-defined or indicated, e.g., in
RMSI

\- Group wise SSB-to-RO mapping by frequency first-time second manner,
where grouping is in time domain

For msg1 transmission of 4-step RACH procedure, if preamble
transmissions are dropped due to LBT failure, then from RAN1
perspective, it is recommended that preamble power ramping is not
performed and that the preamble transmission counter is not incremented.

For msg 2 transmission in the 4-step RACH procedure, in some scenarios
it is beneficial for the maximum RAR window size to be extended beyond
10 ms to improve robustness to DL LBT failure for RAR transmission.
Other candidate mechanisms that were identified without reaching
consensus include preconfigured/pre-indicated/scheduled multiple
opportunities in time and/or frequency domain in different LBT subbands
for message 2/3/4 transmissions and/or reducing the latency of the RACH
procedure and can be considered further when specifications are to be
developed.

Potential modifications to RLM/RRM procedures due to reduced
transmission opportunities for DL signals and channels due to LBT
failure have been identified and studied.

For RLM on an unlicensed SpCell and RRM, it is considered beneficial to
configure DMTCs (DRS Measurement Time Configuration) in which UEs can
perform measurements. It is considered beneficial that these time-domain
measurement windows for RRM measurements and RLM can be different. RLM
DMTC may coincide with DRS transmission window. For RLM, the following
recommendations are considered beneficial for further design when the
specifications are developed:

\- Identifying a set of RLM-RS, e.g., DRS, SS/PBCH blocks, CSI-RS. The
transmission of the RS in a COT may be subject to LBT.

\- Identifying which set(s) of RLM-RS are used for in-sync and
out-of-sync evaluations. For example, determining which RLM-RS within or
outside the RLM measurement window can be utilized for in-sync and
out-of-sync evaluations.

\- Potential definition of a metric, e.g., Rel-15 out-of-sync indication
or new metric, to accurately identify instances of unsuccessful
detection of RLM-RS. Whether/how to report such a metric to higher
layers is determined when the specifications are developed.

It is beneficial to support reporting of RSSI. Furthermore, it is
considered beneficial to report a metric to represent channel occupancy
or medium contention in addition to RSSI, as also noted from a
higher-layer perspective in Section 7.2.2.3.1. The exact definition of
the metric(s) can be considered when specifications are developed.

##### 7.2.1.3.3 Potential HARQ enhancements

NR-U uses NR HARQ feedback mechanisms as baseline, and enhancements can
be identified.

Transmission of HARQ A/N for the corresponding data in the same shared
COT is identified as beneficial. For NR-U, the design strives to support
transmitting all HARQ A/N for the corresponding data in the same shared
COT, if possible, considering the current NR UE processing time
required. A gap of up to 16 μs should be allowed between the end of the
DL transmission and the immediate transmission of feedback to
accommodate for the hardware turnaround time. It is beneficial to be
able to support transmissions (e.g. CSI reporting or SRS, or other
PUSCH, or CSI-RS, or other PDSCH) in the time between one DL data
transmission for a UE and the corresponding UL transmission of DL HARQ
feedback for the same UE within a shared COT. Potential enhancements for
such type of operation, e.g. by possibly pre-configured or
pre-determined uplink transmissions for reducing signaling overhead for
these transmissions, may be beneficial.

However, it is understood in some cases, the HARQ A/N has to be
transmitted in a separate COT from the one the corresponding data was
transmitted. **Introduce** signaling a value of the
**PDSCH-to-HARQ-timing-indicator in the DCI scheduling the PDSCH that
tells the UE that the timing and resource for HARQ-ACK feedback for the
corresponding PDSCH will be determined later.**

Techniques to handle reduced HARQ A/N transmission opportunities for a
given HARQ process due to LBT failure are identified as beneficial.
Potential techniques include mechanisms to provide multiple and/or
supplemental time and/or frequency domain transmission opportunities.

When UL HARQ feedback is transmitted on unlicensed band, NR-U considers
mechanisms to support flexible triggering and multiplexing of HARQ
feedback for one or more DL HARQ processes

NR-U should support both the HARQ feedback corresponding to some or all
the PDSCHs of a channel occupancy can be reported in the same channel
occupancy and HARQ feedback corresponding to PDSCHs of a channel
occupancy can be reported outside of that channel occupancy.

To support the HARQ feedback corresponding to some or all the PDSCHs of
a channel occupancy to be reported in the same channel occupancy, **it
is found beneficial to extend the PDSCH-to-HARQ-timing to support
indicating timings up to the end of the longest COT allowed by
regulations. One or more of the following would be needed: Allow values
larger than 15 by RRC signalling; Allow more bits for the
PDSCH-to-HARQ-timing-indicator.**

To support HARQ feedback corresponding to PDSCHs of a channel occupancy
can be reported outside of that channel occupancy, the following
possible candidate solutions can be considered:

\- Alt1: gNB requests/triggers feedback for PDSCH from earlier COT(s)

\- Alt2: UE is configured to report HARQ feedback for PDSCH from earlier
COT(s) without an explicit request/trigger

\- Alt3: by PDSCH-to-HARQ-timing-indicator in the DCI scheduling the
PDSCH

**The alternatives above are at least applicable for the case where
there is no HARQ feedback expected in the same channel occupancy as the
PDSCH.**

Further details on potential solutions to allow cross-COT HARQ-ACK
feedback and multiple opportunities for HARQ-ACK feedback are provided
in Table 7.2.1.3.3-1.

opportunities

+----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+

**A possible enhancement for dynamic HARQ codebook is to support a
larger DAI field to accommodate for possibly missing more than 4 PDSCH
transmissions, which is more likely to occur on unlicensed spectrum.**
Enhancements are necessary for aligning the dynamic HARQ codebook
between UE and gNB**. Alt. 1** in Table 7.2.1.3.3-1 allows
triggering/requesting a report for missed or unreported HARQ-ACK
feedback in case of LBT failure for PUCCH/PUSCH transmission, or in case
of PUCCH/PUSCH detection failure at gNB, or in case of PDCCH detection
failure at UE, or in case of HARQ-ACK feedback pending from earlier
COT(s)**.** Alt. 2 in the table allows reporting unreported HARQ-ACK
feedback in case of LBT failure for PUCCH/PUSCH transmission, or in case
of HARQ-ACK feedback pending from earlier COT(s).

Scheduling multiple TTIs for PUSCH each using a separate UL grant in the
same PDCCH monitoring occasion is identified as beneficial. Scheduling
multiple TTIs for PUSCH, i.e., scheduling multiple TBs with different
HARQ process IDs over multiple slots, using a single UL grant, is
identified as beneficial and should be supported in NR-U.

In case of CBG-based HARQ and LBT category 4, enhancements for defining
how to adjust the contention window size (CWS) based on TB-level
HARQ-ACK and CBG-level HARQ-ACK would be beneficial.

##### 7.2.1.3.4 Potential enhancements to configured grant

NR already defined Type-1 and Type-2 configured grant mechanism. For
NR-U, there is no necessity to exclude Type-1 or Type-2 configured grant
mechanism for operation of NR in unlicensed spectrum.

The following modifications to the configured grant procedures are
beneficial.

\- Removing dependencies of HARQ process information to the timing. This
can be achieved by introducing UCI on PUSCH to carry HARQ process ID,
NDI, RVID

\- Additional information fields can be considered to be included in the
UCI, e.g. UE-ID, COT sharing information, PUSCH duration, etc.

\- It was identified that the resources utilized by the UCI, and
multiplexing of UCI and data information of PUSCH require consideration
of DMRS placement and starting and ending symbols of the configured
grant based transmissions. Details on multiplexing UCI and data
information of configured grant PUSCH can be determined when
specifications are developed.

\- Introducing Downlink Feedback Information (DFI) including HARQ
feedback for configured grant transmission

\- Increased flexibility on time domain resource allocation for the
configured grant transmissions

\- As for potential solutions to providing flexibility on time domain
resource allocation, bitmap based approach and NR Rel-15 based time
domain resource allocation approach, which includes {periodicity, offset
in the frame, start symbol and length of PUSCH and K-repetition
signaling}, are identified as potential candidates. Additional aspects
such as finer granularity of resource allocation, and multiple resources
within a period may be considered for enhancing flexibility on time
domain resource allocation.- Supporting retransmissions without explicit
UL grant

*Allowing consecutive configured grant resources in time without any
gaps in between the resources and non-consecutive configured grant
resources (not necessarily periodic) with gaps in between the resources
is beneficial and should be considered for NR in unlicensed spectrum*

UE selects the HARQ process ID from an RRC configured set of HARQ IDs
for NR-unlicensed configured grant transmission.

It is identified to be beneficial to support DFI to include pending HARQ
ACK feedback for prior configured grant transmissions from the same UE.

It was identified that it is problematic for the UE to assume ACK in
absence of reception of feedback, which may include explicit feedback or
feedback in the form of uplink grants. It was additionally identified
that assuming NACK upon timer expiration can be a candidate solution to
avoid LBT impact on reception of feedback. It was also identified that
possible conflicts, with respect to NDI and RNTI for the same HARQ
process, between configured grant transmission and scheduled grant
transmission may have to be addressed. Details can be determined when
specifications are developed.

For the retransmission of a HARQ process that was initially transmitted
via configured grant resource, both retransmission via same configured
grant resource and retransmission via resource scheduled by UL grant are
supported.

UE may autonomously initiate retransmission for a HARQ process that was
initially transmitted via configured grant mechanism for NR-unlicensed
when it receives NACK feedback via DFI for the corresponding HARQ
process.

It is identified to be beneficial to consider UE multiplexing and
collision avoidance mechanisms between configured grant transmissions
and between configured grant and scheduled grant transmissions.

NR-unlicensed configured grant transmission is not allowed during the
time when it overlaps with occasions configured for potential NR-U DRS
of the serving cell irrespective of the configured time domain resource
for configured grant transmission.

It was identified that CBG based retransmissions for configured grant
based transmissions is beneficial. Details on which CBG related control
information is transmitted as part of DFI and UCI, and how such control
information is conveyed through DFI and UCI can be determined when
specifications are developed.

It was identified that collision avoidance between configured grant and
scheduled grant based transmission can be achieved by management of
starting point of the transmission for configured grant and scheduled
grant based transmission. Further details on the management of the
starting point of the transmission can be determined when specifications
are developed.

It was identified that sharing resources with gNB within COT(s) that is
acquired by UE(s) as part of configured grant based transmissions should
be supported. It was also identified that allowing configured grant
based transmissions within a gNB acquired COT should be supported.
Details of identification of situations when COT(s) sharing is possible
and the details of potential resource sharing mechanisms and rules can
be determined when specifications are developed.

### 7.2.2 Higher layer aspects

#### 7.2.2.1 Inactive and Idle procedures (38.304 related)

For Inactive and Idle mode procedures, Rel-15 NR design is considered as
the baseline. As such, NR licensed measurement framework (cell and beam
quality derivation for RSRP, RSRQ, and SINR, filtering and combining
multiple beams) is also used as the baseline.

The UE measurements in Idle/Inactive mode will assume recurring
transmissions of SSB/PBCH and RMSI but possibly with reduced
opportunities due to LBT. The impact of LBT on Idle/Inactive measurement
is not captured in RAN2 specifications.

In unlicensed bands, multiple PLMNs can use the same carriers without
any coordination. Therefore, the best cell found by a UE on a frequency
may not belong the registered PLMN. In this case, the UE should be
enabled to camp on a non-best cell on a carrier if the best cell does
not belong to the registered PLMN (or E-PLMN), where the non-best cell
would still be the best cell of the registered PLMN.

For paging, it may be beneficial to introduce more opportunities per DRX
cycle for the UE to receive the page. The additional locations can be
provided in time domain by configuring an extended paging occasion (i.e.
a paging window) or configuring multiple paging occasions to a UE. In
any specified solution(s) based on additional paging opportunities, the
UE power consumption should also be taken into account; to this end, it
is beneficial that the paging occasions are transmitted in close time to
or overlap with the reference signals.

#### 7.2.2.2 L2 impacts

##### 7.2.2.2.1 RACH (4-step, 2-step)

Both 4-step and 2-step RACH will be supported for NR-U. Here 2-step RACH
refers to the procedure which can complete contention-based RACH (CBRA)
in two steps as explained below. One additional benefit of 2-step RACH
is due to less LBT impact with the reduced number of messages. However,
in order to alleviate the impact of LBT failures further, additional
opportunities for the RACH messages may be introduced, e.g. in time or
frequency domain, for both 4-step and 2-step RACH. The additional
opportunities for 4-step RACH will be applicable to both msg1 and msg3.

NR-U will support contention-free RACH (CFRA) and CBRA for both 2-step
and 4-step RACH. On SCells, CFRA is supported as a baseline while both
CBRA and CFRA are supported on SpCells.

For 4-step RACH, the messages in time order are named as msg1, msg2,
msg3, msg4 and for 2-step RACH, they are named msgA and msgB.

A single RACH procedure i will be used and thus multiple RACH procedures
in parallel will not be supported for NR-U.As a baseline, the
random-access response to msg1 will be on SpCell and msg3 is assumed to
use a predetermined HARQ ID.

In legacy RACH, the counters for preamble transmission and power ramping
are increased with every attempt. In NR-U, power ramping is not applied
when preamble is not transmitted due to LBT failure. This will require
an indication from the physical layer to the MAC. In addition,
ra-ResponseWindow is not started when the preamble is not transmitted
due to LBT failure.

It is assumed that ra-ContentionResolutionTimer may need to be extended
with larger values to overcome the LBT impact.

For 2-step RACH, the msgA is a signal to detect the UE and a payload
while the second message is for contention resolution for CBRA with a
possible payload. msgA will at least include the equivalent information
which is transmitted in msg3 for 4-step RACH.

NOTE: Further input from RAN1 will be needed for the payload size of
msgA.

As a baseline, all the triggers for 4-step RACH are also applicable to
2-step RACH; however further analysis is needed on SI request and BFR as
well as how timing advance and grants can be obtained for msgA.

The contention resolution in 2-step RACH will be performed by including
a UE identifier in the first message which is echoed in the second
message. The type of UE identifier(s) is FFS.

Fall-back from 2-step RACH to 4-step RACH will be supported. The
fallback after msgA transmission is feasible only if detection of the UE
without the decoding of the payload is possible and thus relies on such
support at the physical layer.

If 2-step RACH is used for initial access, the parameters for 2-step
RACH procedure including resources for msgA will be broadcasted.

NOTE: 2-step RACH if applied to licensed operation would not take into
account LBT.

##### 7.2.2.2.2 MAC (except RACH)

For scheduling request (SR), a prohibit timer as in NR licensed can be
used. However, this should not prevent the UE from attempting to
transmit an SR again if the triggered SR was not transmitted due to LBT
failure.

##### 7.2.2.2.3 Other

For channel access and transmissions in NR-U the mechanisms and
associated signaling adopted by LTE LAA (e.g. standardized QCI to access
priority mapping for DL and UL, how access priority per logical channel
is determined for scheduled UL and AUL transmissions etc) are used as
the baseline. Any changes due to new physical layer design and channel
access mechanisms for NR-U (e.g. introduction of PRACH, support of FBE)
can also be introduced.

In addition, access priority for control signaling (transmissions over
SRBs) over unlicensed carriers should be introduced for stand-alone and
DC NR-U. In this case, it is assumed that control signaling will have
the highest access priority.

#### 7.2.2.3 Control plane impacts

##### 7.2.2.3.1 RLM/RLF and mobility (conn mode)

For non-standalone NR-U deployments, connected mode mobility is
supported on licensed spectrum using the baseline mobility procedure
specified for the concerned licensed radio access technology (LTE or
NR).

For standalone NR-U deployments, the following mobility scenarios shall
be supported:

\- Inter-cell handover between NR-U and NR-U;

\- Inter-cell handover between NR-U and NR.

In addition, the following mobility scenarios shall be supported based
on the mobility between NR-U and NR and and the mobility between NR and
(e)LTE, however further optimizations to this scenarios will be
considered possibly with lower priority:

\- Inter-RAT handover between NR-U and LTE connected to EPC;

\- Inter-RAT handover between NR-U and LTE connected to 5GC.

For connected mode mobility, the main issue identified for NR operation
in unlicensed band is the reduced transmission opportunities for
different signalings due to LBT failure.

The following modifications to mobility-related procedures have been
identified as beneficial to study:

\- Modifications to mobility-related measurements considering
limitations to the transmission of reference signals due to LBT. NR-U
needs to consider techniques to handle reduced RS (e.g. SS/PBCH block
and CSI-RS) transmission opportunities due to LBT failure.

\- Modifications to mobility-related measurements and/or triggers
considering limitations related to high channel occupancy. NR-U needs to
consider techniques to handle increased interference levels in the
unlicensed channel for mobility-related decisions.

\- Modifications to mobility-related procedures and/or triggers
considering limitations related to the transmission of control plane
signalling due to LBT. NR-U needs to consider whether NR-U specific
techniques to handle additional signaling delays due to LBT failure are
required, if not resolved by general mobility enhancement solutions
\[RP-181433\].

Potential modifications to the measurement reporting quantities, to the
measurement reporting triggers and to the condition used by the UE when
delaying the time at which it applies a reconfiguration for mobility
that are based at least on channel occupancy and RSSI should be studied.

For RRM, RLM, and mobility procedures, NR licensed specification in
Rel-15 are considered as a baseline for NR-U. However, changes to these
due to new physical layer design and LBT for the unlicensed operation
can be introduced. These will support both synchronous and, except for
LAA case, asynchronous deployments.

The RRM and RLM framework for NR-U will also support multiple beam
operation. The measurement of multiple beams in NR-U will use the
framework in TS 38.300 Section 9.2.4 as a baseline and the measurement
model captured in Figure 9.2.4-1 is also applicable for NR-U.

For UE measurements, it is assumed that recurring transmissions of
SSB/PBCH and RMSI will be available with possibly reduced opportunities
due to LBT. The NR licensed measurement framework (cell and beam quality
derivation for RSRP, RSRQ, and SINR, filtering and combining multiple
beams) is used as a baseline. The handling of missing measurements due
to LBT are expected to be captured at physical layer specifications.

In addition to the existing measurement quantities, channel occupancy
and RSSI, similar to adopted for LTE LAA, are considered useful.

In unlicensed spectrum, multiple PLMNs from different operators can
share the same channel and coordination between different operators may
not happen. This may cause PCI collisions or confusion. As one possible
solution, the gNBs can scan different frequencies to identify the PCIs
of neighbour cells and use this information in setting the PCIs of their
own cells in order to avoid PCI collisions. In addition, ANR can be
used, as in NR licensed, to detect and solve PCI collision and
confusion.

##### 7.2.2.3.2 Other

Since System Information (SI) transmissions will be subject to LBT, it
is beneficial to add more transmission opportunities in time domain for
SI transmission, e.g. by configuring a longer SI window.

If there is need to have multiple SI messages then with existing NR
design, different SI messages require separate LBT procedures. It may be
beneficial not to require multiple LBTs for different SI messages to
increase the success probability of the transmission.

In response to a RAN2 LS requesting study of system level aspects of
NR-U, SA2 has discussed this topic and concluded as follows:

\- Based on SA2 analysis, only system impact identified specifically for
NR-U is the need for introducing RAT type for NR-U, if desired, for
\"subscription based access restriction\", policy and charging purpose.

\- If a non-public network operator wants to leverage NR-U, Network
Identification & Network selection aspects for operators with no
globally unique PLMN ID are already being addressed within
FS\_Vertical\_LAN study ongoing in SA2. Thus NR-U is not resulting in
additional system impacts work.

\- The same impact identified for 5GS applies also for EPS. SA2
understanding is that for NR-U in EPS it is only for NR-U as secondary
RAT (ENDC case) following similar approach in terms of subscription
based access restriction, policy and charging as LAA/LWA. As such,
similar solution can be adopted as the one that already exists in EPS.

Based on the SA2 analysis and response, there is no impact to RAN for
the possible changes to 5GS and EPS for NR-U. The support for
\"subscription based access restriction\", policy and charging is
contained to CN signalling and the support for non-public operator
network identification will not result in additional work specific to
NR-U.

8 Performance evaluations
=========================

For performance evaluation, coexistence with other networks will be
evaluation, such as Wi-Fi, LTE-LAA, or other NR-U network.

When coexistence with Wi-Fi is evaluated, following the study item
description \[2\], NR-based operation in unlicensed spectrum should not
impact deployed Wi-Fi services (data, video and voice services) more
than an additional Wi-Fi network on the same carrier, where the deployed
Wi-Fi includes 11ac in 5GHz band.

For sub-7 GHz bands other than 5GHz band, though it is not in the scope
of this study to define a fairness criterion with other RATs, a fairness
criterion for coexistence has been discussed but no conclusions were
reached. Coexistence simulations with other RATs have been performed
using technology neutral assumptions (eg. channel access mechanism) at
an arbitrary carrier frequency in 5GHz band for application to bands
other than 5GHz which may become available subject to regulations. The
study assumes regulation will provide the framework concerning the
protection for the technologies not using unlicensed access in those
bands. For this coexistence evaluation, as the regulations on channel
access is not yet available, companies have provided description on the
assumptions used for technology neutral channel access mechanism when
providing simulation results.

8.1 Scenarios and methodology
-----------------------------

For the NR-U study evaluation, to reuse the simulation platform already
developed for NR study, the 5GCM in \[29\] is used for NR-U simulation
evaluation. The evaluation deployment scenarios are derived from NR
evaluation deployment scenarios as defined in \[28\] with proper
modifications to introduce the second operator. For coexistence
evaluations below 7GHz, for parameters not provided in this section, the
evaluations assumptions specified for LTE (e)LAA coexistence evaluations
\[31\] apply. The base metrics for NR-U evaluation are the same as in
LTE-LAA in \[31\].

NR-U simulation evaluation considers the following layout scenarios:

\- Indoor sub-7GHz, 2 operators

\- Outdoor Sub-7 GHz, 2 operators

\- Stadium scenario for sub-7GHz, 2 operators, can be optionally
considered by interested companies.

The following deployment scenarios for simulation are identified:

\- CA between NR licensed cell and NR unlicensed cell

\- DC (with LTE and with NR)

\- SA

\- An NR cell with DL in unlicensed band and UL in licensed band

In the simulations, only unlicensed cell(s) is to be simulated. The
licensed cell may not be explicitly modelled in the simulation.
Necessary assumptions regarding the presence of the licensed carriers
can be made and provided.

It was also noted that a single set of evaluations may be applicable to
multiple deployment scenarios. For example, DC and SA deployment
scenarios can share the same set of simulations, possibly with some
minor differences on how the overhead (say for system information
delivery) is captured in the result.

### 8.1.1 Sub7 GHz indoor scenario

For sub7 GHz indoor simulation evaluation, two operators each with 3
gNBs are deployed in a room of size 120 meters by 80 meters as shown in
Figure 1. In the figure, the gNB of the same color belongs to the same
operator. The parameters are of value a=20 meters, b=40 meters, c=20
meters, and d=40 meters. The deployment scenario is selected to achieve
a target serving link RSSI distribution with 10%-15% serving link below
-72dBm.

Figure 1: Indoor sub7 simulation office layout

Additional evaluation parameters are provided in Annex A.1.1.

### 8.1.2 Sub7GHz outdoor scenario

For sub 7 GHz outdoor simulation evaluation, two scenarios are
considered. The two scenarios differ in the inter-gNB distance within
the same macro cell.

\- Scenario 1: Within each macro cell coverage, two operators each drop
one micro gNB with a maximum distance of 30 meters between the gNBs

\- Scenario 2: Within each macro cell coverage, two operators each drop
one micro gNB with no limitation on the inter-gNB distance.

The layout of the gNBs are defined as follows:

\- Macro deployment with ISD=200×A meters

> \- A=1.0 for scenario 1

\- A=1.5 for scenario 2- Each operator randomly drops 1 micro-layer TRP
within each macro cell sector with minimum distance between micro-layer
TRPs equals 57.9×A meters

\- Independent dropping between two operators

\- Use 10 meters as the inter-operator micro-layer TRP minimum distance

\- For the inter-operator micro-layer TRP maximum distance

\- Outdoor scenario 1: 30

\- Outdoor scenario 2: No limit as long as the TRP is within the macro
cell

The layout of UEs are defined as follows:

\- UE randomly dropped within macro cell sector with a minimum serving
cell RSSI of -82dBm

\- All UEs dropped outdoor

Additional evaluation parameters are provided in Annex A.1.2.

8.2 Channel access schemes
--------------------------

The channel access schemes for NR-based access for unlicensed spectrum
can be classified into the following categories:

*- Category 1: Immediate transmission after a short switching gap*

\- This is used for a transmitter to immediately transmit after a
switching gap inside a COT.

\- The switching gap from reception to transmission is to accommodate
the transceiver turnaround time and is no longer than 16 µs.

*- Category 2: LBT without random back-off*

\- The duration of time that the channel is sensed to be idle before the
transmitting entity transmits is deterministic.

*- Category 3: LBT with random back-off with a contention window of
fixed size*

\- The LBT procedure has the following procedure as one of its
components. The transmitting entity draws a random number N within a
contention window. The size of the contention window is specified by the
minimum and maximum value of N. The size of the contention window is
fixed. The random number N is used in the LBT procedure to determine the
duration of time that the channel is sensed to be idle before the
transmitting entity transmits on the channel.

*- Category 4: LBT with random back-off with a contention window of
variable size*

\- The LBT procedure has the following as one of its components. The
transmitting entity draws a random number N within a contention window.
The size of contention window is specified by the minimum and maximum
value of N. The transmitting entity can vary the size of the contention
window when drawing the random number N. The random number N is used in
the LBT procedure to determine the duration of time that the channel is
sensed to be idle before the transmitting entity transmits on the
channel.

For different transmissions in a COT and different channels/signals to
be transmitted, different categories of channel access schemes can be
used.

8.3 Evaluation results
----------------------

For coexistence evaluation, WiFi+WiFi, WiFi+NR-U and NR-U+NR-U
evaluations are baseline with equal priority.

When submitting coexistence evaluation results, the following
information should be reported

\- The COT assumptions of Wi-Fi and NR-U

\- Is RTS/CTS enabled for Wi-Fi

\- PD/ED threshold assumptions

\- Max modulation order supported in each technology

\- MIMO scheme and number of MIMO layers used for both technologies

\- Wi-Fi MAC layer A-MPDU/A-MSDU aggregation level, MPDU size

\- NR-U SCS,

\- Wi-Fi guard interval

\- NR UE processing time capability (\#1 or \#2)

\- NR PDSCH/PUSCH mapping type, PDCCH monitoring configuration

\- Link adaptation assumptions

\- NR assumption on self scheduling or using cross carrier scheduling

Evaluation results are included in Annex B.

### 8.3.1 Coexistence evaluation results for 5GHz

Key findings of the evaluation results in Annex B.1 for 5GHz band are
discussed in this section. The single carrier scenario with stand-alone
deployment and LAA deployment for NR-U were both evaluated.

#### 8.3.1.1 Detailed findings for indoor scenarios

Key findings from Tables in Annex B.1, which captured the results for an
indoor deployment with one shared unlicensed carrier and FTP traffic are
summarized below.

\- Nine sources evaluated NR-U with a category 4 LBT scheme with CCA-ED
threshold of -72dBm for NR-U.

\- Five sources evaluated licensed assisted access scheme.

\- One source provided results for two subcarrier spacing settings and
reported an improvement in all measured metrics for the non-replaced
Wi-Fi operator.

\- Two sources reported an improvement in all measured metrics for the
non-replaced Wi-Fi operator while one source reported an improvement in
44 of the 48 metrics for the non-replaced Wi-Fi operator.

\- One source also provided results for DL only traffic and UL only
traffic on the unlicensed carrier and reported an improvement in all
measured metrics for the non-replaced Wi-Fi operator.

\- One source also provided results with mixed traffic for Wi-Fi
operator and reported an improvement in all measured metrics for the
non-replaced Wi-Fi operator. The source also reported improvement in
VoIP performance for the non-replaced Wi-Fi operator.

\- One source also provided results comparing coexistence performance
for three cases, NR-U node using CCA-ED threshold of -72, -82 and third
case where NR-U node enables Wi-Fi preamble detection and reported that
all 3 schemes co-exist fairly with Wi-Fi and that using ED threshold of
-82dBm provides better coexistence performance for both NR-U and Wi-Fi
nodes than enabling Wi-Fi preamble detection.

\- One source provided results for mixed traffic with two LBT modes
(category 1 immediate transmission and category 2 ) for scheduled UL in
gNB acquired COT. The source provided results only for high buffer
occupancy and reported a degradation in most metrics for the
non-replaced Wi-Fi operator for both cases. The source also provided
results with Wi-Fi preamble detection enabled a the NR-U node and
reported an improvement in 15 out of the16 metrics (only high buffer
occupancy metrics) for the non-replaced Wi-Fi operator. The source
reported a degradation in VoIP performance for the non-replaced Wi-Fi
operator for all three cases.

\- Four sources evaluated for a stand-alone NR-U deployment on an
unlicensed carrier.

\- One source reported an improvement in 47 of the 48 measured metrics
for the non-replaced Wi-Fi operator with a maximum degradation under 5%.

\- One source reported an improvement in 35 of the 48 measured metrics
for the non-replaced Wi-Fi operator.

\- One source provided results with RTS/CTS enabled for Wi-Fi operator,
DRS modelled with DRS using category 2 LBT for channel access in the
DMTC window for the NR-U operator and reported an improvement in 40 of
the 48 measured metrics for the non-replaced Wi-Fi operator with a
maximum degradation under 10%. The source also provided results for the
case where HARQ-ACK feedback is sent within a gap of 16us after the end
of DL transmission and showed improvements in the coexistence
performance compared to the case where the HARQ-ACK feedback is sent at
a gap of 24us after the end of DL transmission using category 2 LBT.

\- One source provided results with RTS/CTS enabled, DRS modelled with
DRS using category 2 LBT for channel access in the DMTC window, and with
multiple switching points with switching gaps no longer than 16 µs in
the COT used for control information transmission and reported an

#### 8.3.1.4 Summary of observations

In all evaluation results submitted, category 4 LBT with -72 dBm ED
threshold was the primary scheme used in the evaluations for obtaining
the COT. In all simulation when a Wi-Fi preamble was used, a fixed
CCA-PD threshold of -82dBm was assumed. Other LBT schemes used in the
evaluations include immediate transmission for switching of transmission
direction with switching gap \< 16us and category 2 LBT for switching of
transmission direction with gap \> 16us, for scheduled UL in gNB
acquired COT, for DRS transmission, and for PRACH transmission.
Companies evaluated the three agreed scenarios defined in Section 8.1.
The parameters listed in Section 8.3 were left for companies to choose,
and are provided together with the evaluation results in Annex B.

Eight out of nine sources showed combinations of DL and UL LBT schemes
for NR-U with CCA-ED of -72dBm and no CCA-PD do not impact Wi-Fi more
than another Wi-Fi network in any of the measured performance metrics in
all three evaluated scenarios. One of nine sources indicated degradation
of Wi-Fi performance when coexist with NR-U in some scenarios (Section
8.3.1.1).

Three sources submitted results with NR-U transmitting and receiving
Wi-Fi 802.11a preamble and showed combinations of DL and UL LBT schemes
for NR-U with CCA-ED of -62dBm and CCA-PD of -82dBm do not impact Wi-Fi
more than another Wi-Fi network in any of the measured performance
metrics in all evaluated scenarios.

Three sources submitted results with NR-U transmitting and receiving
Wi-Fi 802.11a preamble. For indoor scenario, two sources indicated fair
coexistence with mostly improved performance for both Wi-Fi and NR-U
when NR-U with CCA-ED of -62dBm and CCA-PD of -82dBm compared with NR-U
with CCA-ED of -72dBm and no Wi-Fi 802.11a preamble. For outdoor
scenario 1, one source indicated fair coexistence with mostly degraded
performance for both Wi-Fi and NR-U when NR-U with CCA-ED of -62dBm and
CCA-PD of -82dBm compared with NR-U with CCA-ED of -72dBm and no Wi-Fi
802.11a preamble.

Two sources submitted results for indoor scenario and one source
submitted results for outdoor scenario 1 with NR-U transmitting and
receiving Wi-Fi 802.11a preamble for NR-U and NR-U coexistence in the
absence of Wi-Fi, and showed combinations of DL and UL LBT schemes for
NR-U with CCA-ED of -62dBm and CCA-PD of -82dBm degrades NR-U
performance compared with NR-U with CCA-ED of -72dBm and no Wi-Fi
802.11a preamble.

Two sources submitted results for indoor scenario with NR-U with CCA-ED
reduced below -72dBm for all NR-U devices. The sources indicated fair
coexistence with mostly improved performance for both Wi-Fi and NR-U
when NR-U with CCA-ED reduced below -72dBm compared with NR-U with
CCA-ED of -62dBm and CCA-PD of -82dBm Wi-Fi 802.11a preamble.

For the case where an NR-U network coexists with an 802.11ac network in
the indoor scenario and a NR-U DL/UL switching gap less than 16 μs, and
NR-U UL data transmission after the gap with Category 1 channel access
without any additional restrictions on duration other than the MCOT
limits, one source has shown that there is a degradation to the
throughput and VoIP outage performance of 802.11ac, while another source
has shown that the throughput and VoIP outage performance of 802.11ac
improves, when compared to the case where two 802.11ac networks coexist.

### 8.3.2 Coexistence evaluation results for 6GHz

Key findings of the evaluation results in Annex B.1 for 6GHz band are
discussed in this section. Due to its greenfield nature, coexistence
evaluations were performed using technology neutral assumptions (eg.
channel access mechanism) and the companies provided simulation results
along with their assumptions on technology neutral channel access
schemes and coexistence performance metrics.

#### 8.3.2.1 Detailed findings for indoor scenarios

Key findings from Tables in Annex B.1 which captured the results for an
indoor deployment with one shared unlicensed carrier and FTP traffic are
summarized below.

\- Two sources provided evaluation results for a stand-alone NR-U
deployment on an unlicensed carrier specifically for 6GHz.

\- One source provided results of Wi-Fi operator with RTS/CTS disabled
using CCA-ED of -72dBm and PD of -82dBm and reported an improvement in
37 of the 48 metrics (agreed to be used for the 5GHz bands) for the
non-replaced Wi-Fi operator with the maximum degradation being \< 4%
compared to the case where the Wi-Fi operator was using CCA-ED of -62dBm
and PD of -82dBm. In both these cases, all reported metrics for the
non-replaced Wi-Fi operator are better with NR-U network as neighbour
than Wi-Fi network as neighbour.

\- One source also provided results comparing NRU-WiFi coexistence
performance for two cases: (Case 1) Wi-Fi node using CCA-ED threshold of
-72 and PD of -82dBm; and NR-U node using CCA-ED threshold of -72 dBm,
and (Case 2) Wi-Fi node using CCA-ED threshold of -62 and PD of -82dBm;
and NR-U node using CCA-ED threshold of -72 dBm and reported that Case 1
provides better coexistence performance than Case 2 for both NRU and
Wi-Fi nodes.

\- One source provided evaluation results for a non-stand-alone NR-U
deployment on an unlicensed carrier specifically for 6GHz.

\- One source provided results for CCA-ED threshold varying between
-62dBm to -82dBm for case when Wi-Fi operator uses the same CCA-ED and
CCA-PD threshold and the NR-U operator uses the same CCA-ED threshold as
the Wi-Fi operator and observed that the higher ED threshold of -62dBm
provides the best performance. The results showed that Wi-Fi operator
using CCA-ED -72 dBm and CCA-PD of -72 dBm gives better Wi-Fi UPT
performance than Wi-Fi using CCA-ED -62 dBm and CCA-PD of -82 dBm for
the Wi-Fi operator, while NR-U operator uses CCA-ED -72 dBm. The results
showed that Wi-Fi operator using CCA-ED -72 dBm and CCA-PD of -72 dBm
while NR-U operator uses CCA-ED -72 dBm gives better Wi-Fi UPT
performance than Wi-Fi using CCA-ED -82 dBm and CCA-PD of -82 dBm for
the Wi-Fi operator while NR-U operator uses CCA-ED -82 dBm. The results
showed that Wi-Fi operator using CCA-ED -72 dBm and CCA-PD of -72 dBm
gives better Wi-Fi UPT performance than Wi-Fi using CCA-ED -62 dBm and
CCA-PD of -82 dBm for the Wi-Fi operator, while NR-U operator uses
CCA-ED of -62dBm and CCA-NRU-PD of -82dBm. The results showed that Wi-Fi
operator using CCA-PD of -82dBm and CCA-ED of -62dBm while NRU operator
using CCA-ED of -62dBm gives better UPT performance for both Wi-Fi and
NRU operator than Wi-Fi operator using CCA-PD of -82dBm and CCA-ED of
-72dBm while NRU operator using CCA-ED of -72dBm. In all these cases,
all reported metrics for the non-replaced Wi-Fi operator are better with
NR-U network as neighbour than Wi-Fi network as neighbour.

#### 8.3.2.2 Detailed findings for outdoor scenario 1

Key findings from Tables in Annex B.2 which captured the results for an
indoor deployment with one shared unlicensed carrier and FTP traffic are
summarized below.

\- One source provided evaluation results for a stand-alone NR-U
deployment on an unlicensed carrier specifically for 6GHz.

\- One source provided results of Wi-Fi operator with RTS/CTS disabled
using CCA-ED of -72dBm and PD of -82dBm and reported an improvement in
47 of the 48 metrics (agreed to be used for the 5GHz bands) for the
non-replaced Wi-Fi operator with the maximum degradation being \< 0.2%
compared to the case where the Wi-Fi operator was using CCA-ED of -62dBm
and PD of -82dBm. In both these cases, all reported metrics for the
non-replaced Wi-Fi operator are better with NR-U network as neighbour
than Wi-Fi network as neighbour.

#### 8.3.2.3 Summary of observations

For 6 GHz bands, though it is not in the scope of this study to define a
fairness criterion with other RATs, a fairness criterion for coexistence
has been discussed but no conclusions were reached. For 6GHz coexistence
evaluation, the parameters and behaviour of Wi-Fi 802.11ax system and
the fairness criterion were left for companies to choose, and are
provided together with the evaluation results in Annex B. In the
submitted evaluation results, the assumption on the technology neutral
channel access mechanism is equal CCA-ED threshold.

Given the assumptions used in the evaluations, all three sources
provided results that show that Wi-Fi and NR-U performance is improved
when a common CCA-ED threshold is used between Wi-Fi and NR-U compared
to when different CCA-ED thresholds are used between Wi-Fi and NR-U.
This was shown for the case where Wi-Fi uses CCA-PD at -82 dBm, and for
the case where Wi-Fi uses CCA-PD at the same threshold as CCA-ED. For
indoor scenario, one source observed that Wi-Fi and NR-U performance is
improved when a common CCA-ED threshold of -62dBm is used compared to
when a common CCA-ED threshold of -72dBm is used.

8.4 Adjacent channel interference analysis
------------------------------------------

The aim of this section is to evaluate the impact of Adjacent Channel
Interference (ACI) on system performance. Therefore, a generic scenario
is considered in which the aggressor system and the victim system use
adjacent channels. 3GPP has a consolidated procedure to evaluate the
impact of ACI. This methodology is based on modelling Adjacent Channel
Interference Ratio (ACIR) as described in \[33\].

Numerous evaluations on adjacent channel coexistence with a similar
setup as above were done under Rel-13 LAA SI. These results were
extensively documented in \[31\].

Since similar deployment scenarios are also considered in NR-U compared
to LAA, and similar output power levels are considered, then the
previous adjacent channel coexistence evaluation between LAA and WiFi
can be directly used for comparison between NR-U and WiFi.

Note that, NR-U may have higher spectrum utilization compared to LAA. It
is considered to define the same ACLR (and ACS) requirements for LAA and
NR-U (in 5GHz as an example), since ACLR (and ACS) requirements for NR
FR1 are the same as for LTE. So, regardless of the higher spectrum
utilization in NR, the same ACLR has to be met by NR-U devices.

In NR-U, there will be higher channel bandwidth (CBW) than 20MHz.
However, this will not change the already understood conclusions from
LAA regarding ACLR and ACS, since the ACLR and ACS values specified in
LAA are the same for single carrier operation and contiguous CA
operation, meaning in both cases, an LAA BS has to satisfy 35dB ACLR
outside its channel bandwidth.

Thus the following is concluded:

\- The deployment scenario in Rel-15 NR-U is very similar to Rel-13 LAA
deployment scenario and the regulatory requirements remain the same for
5GHz spectrum, so the conclusions of Rel-13 LAA adjacent channel
coexistence evaluations are equally applicable to Rel-15 NR-U.

\- It is possible to assume same ACLR (and ACS) requirements for LAA and
NR-U (in 5GHz as an example), following the principle that, ACLR (and
ACS) requirements for other NR FR1 bands are the same as LTE.

9 Conclusions
=============

This technical report presents the results of a study on the operation
of NR in sub 7 GHz unlicensed spectrum (NR-U). Multiple deployment
scenarios for NR-U have been identified, including carrier aggregation
(CA) with NR, dual connectivity (DC) with LTE or NR, stand-alone (SA),
and SA with DL in unlicensed band and UL in licensed band.

The modifications to NR needed to allow it to operate in unlicensed
spectrum as a Secondary cell through carrier aggregation, as a PSCell
through DC, and as a primary cell in stand-alone deployment are studied
and documented. The relevant regulatory requirements have been
summarized in section 4. The study concludes that it is feasible to
modify NR to operate in unlicensed spectrum in carrier aggregation (CA)
with a licensed band NR carrier(s), dual connectivity (DC) with LTE or
NR in a licensed band, stand-alone (SA) with DL and UL in unlicensed
band, and SA with DL in unlicensed band and UL in licensed band.

When deployed in unlicensed bands, NR-U needs to coexist with other
deployments with same or other RATs, and coexistence performance has
been evaluated. For the coexistence evaluation, three scenarios (indoor,
outdoor scenario 1, and outdoor scenario 2) have been defined, as
documented in section 8.

For 5GHz band, where Wi-Fi 802.11ac has been widely deployed, the
coexistence evaluation assumes two independent networks (e.g.,
NR-U+Wi-Fi or Wi-Fi+Wi-Fi) are deployed in the same area, and the
fairness criterion is defined as the NR-U network not degrading Wi-Fi
802.11ac network performance when NR-U and Wi-Fi 802.11ac are deployed
in the area compared to the case where two Wi-Fi 802.11ac networks are
deployed in the area, i.e., the same fairness criterion as used in the
LTE LAA studies \[31\].

For 6GHz band (e.g. US 5925 -- 7125 MHz, or European 5925 -- 6425 MHz,
or parts thereof), since both NR-U and Wi-Fi are new systems to be
deployed in these bands (band definitions depending on regulations), a
technology neutral fairness criterion is required for the coexistence
evaluation. Though it is not in the scope of this study to define a
fairness criterion with other RATs, a fairness criterion for coexistence
has been discussed but no conclusions were reached. For the 6 GHz
coexistence evaluation in this study, the assumption of same CCA-ED
threshold across technologies is applied as the technology neutral
channel access mechanism.

The coexistence evaluations performed during the study item are
documented in section 8.3. The 5GHz band coexistence evaluation results
are listed in Section 8.3.1. The studies show that when the appropriate
channel access schemes, as defined in Section 8.2, are used, it is
feasible for NR-U to achieve fair coexistence with Wi-Fi, and for NR-U
to coexist with itself, under conditions described in Section 8.3.1.4.
The 6GHz band coexistence evaluation results are listed in Section
8.3.2.

Wideband operation in integer multiple of 20MHz is supported in NR-U and
channel access can be performed at least in units of 20MHz, at least for
band where absence of Wi-Fi cannot be guaranteed. Options to support
wideband operation have been identified (Section 7.2.1.1)

For LBE mode of operation, it is recommended that NR-U supports single
DL/UL switching point operation within a gNB initiated COT, as in
LTE-LAA, as well as multiple DL/UL switching points within a gNB
initiated COT. It is recommended that Cat 4 channel access is used for
gNB or UE to initiate a COT for normal data transmissions, while gNB can
use Cat 2 channel access for DRS transmission when DRS satisfies some
conditions (Section 7.2.1.3.1). It is recommended that for a switching
point gap of up to 16 µs, where the gap accommodates for the transceiver
turnaround time, immediate transmission can take place within the same
COT. It is recommended that for a gap of more than 16 µs but less than
25 µs, Cat 2 LBT can be used within the same COT. It is also recommended
that for the case of a single switching point within a COT, where the
switching gap exceeds 25 µs, Cat 2 LBT can be used within the same COT
(Section 7.2.1.3.1). Partial slot transmission at the beginning of the
gNB or UE initiated COT is identified as beneficial and multiple
techniques to support partial slot transmissions have been studied.

For FBE mode of operation, according to regulation, the channel access
of FBE is in unit of fixed frame periods. A Cat 2 LBT is used before
each fixed frame period to determine if the fixed frame period can be
occupied. Within an occupied fixed frame period, for a gap of up to 16
µs, Cat 1 channel access can be used. For a gap of more than 16 µs in an
occupied fixed frame period, Cat 2 LBT should be used.

The enhancements needed for initial access and mobility procedures are
captured in Section 7.2.1.3.2. The issue of reduced transmission
opportunities due to LBT failure for SS/PBCH block transmission, message
1/2/3/4 transmission in 4-step RACH procedure, RLM/RRM, and paging has
been identified, and some enhancements are described.

For HARQ, benefits of supporting the transmission of all HARQ A/N within
the same shared COT as the PDSCH(s), have been identified. Multiple
techniques to handle reduced HARQ A/N transmission opportunities due to
LBT failure have been identified (Section 7.2.1.3.3). Furthermore,
enhancements to UL scheduling, such as scheduling multiple slots for
PUSCH(s) using a single UL grant, as is possible for LTE-eLAA, were
identified as beneficial.

For configured grant, benefits of enhancing the NR design for NR-U have
been identified (Section 7.2.1.3.4). Introducing UCI on PUSCH to carry
HARQ process ID, NDI, RVID has been identified as beneficial in removing
dependencies of HARQ process information to the timing. The identified
enhancements also include introducing Downlink Feedback Information
(DFI) including HARQ feedback for configured grant transmission,
increased flexibility on time domain resource allocation for the
configured grant transmissions and supporting retransmissions without
explicit UL grant.

The enhancements identified for physical layer signal and channels are
captured in Section 7.2.1.2. For SS/PBCH block transmission in NR-U DRS,
it has been identified as beneficial to include CSI-RS and
RMSI-CORESET(s) and RMSI-PDSCH(s) in the same contiguous burst when
transmission of CSI-RS/RMSI are configured. Optionally OSI and paging
can be transmitted in the same DRS if there are available resources. For
UL signals/channels, a study on the waveform design to satisfy the
Occupied Channel Bandwidth requirement and Power Spectral Density
requirements of unlicensed bands was conducted, and it was determined
that it is feasible to introduce a block-interlaced waveform for PUCCH
and PUSCH for UL as enhancements to existing NR UL waveforms to satisfy
the requirements. It has been identified that enhancement of one or more
Rel.15 NR PRACH formats is feasible. Several enhancements to SRS design
have been identified.

From RAN2 perspective, the radio interface architecture and protocols
between UE and RAN to support operation in unlicensed spectrum were
studied. This included MAC, RLM, RRM, mobility, and other layer 2/3 user
and control plane aspects. The recommended enhancements to NR baseline
are of two types:

\- A set of enhancements to alleviate the impact of LBT (e.g., impacts
of reduced transmission opportunities);

\- Enhancements needed due to the unique nature of operation in
unlicensed spectrum (e.g. support for multiple operators in the same
frequency).

It was concluded that the NR licensed baseline along with the
enhancements captured in this TR can support NR-U operation in CA, DC,
and stand-alone (SA) modes.

The system level aspects of NR-U were also studied. It was concluded
that, other than support of differentiated policy and charging, no other
impact to EPS and 5GS is expected. Furthermore, it is expected that
aspects associated with non-public networks will be covered under
ongoing work in SA groups.

From RAN4 perspective, based on the discussions in Section 8.4, it can
be concluded that, if NR-U has similar adjacent channel leakage as LAA,
then NR-U and Wi-Fi can coexist in adjacent channels. If NR-U has
similar leakage and selectivity requirements as LAA, the LAA study can
be used to conclude that NR-U will cause less adjacent channel
interference to a Wi-Fi system compared to another Wi-Fi system.

It is feasible for UEs and BSs to operate in the 5GHz unlicensed
spectrum as NR-U systems. Suitable RF requirements should be specified
taking into account issues including implementation complexity and
performance.

<td><p><strong>Additional Comments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Wi-Fi 802.11ac</strong>: DL and UL transmissions use independent CAT4 LBT. No COT sharing between AP and Client, since it is not allowed by 802.11ac. Only ACK transmitted with no-LBT within 16us of the corresponding data transmission. Short guard interval, beam-forming and closed loop link adaptation based on channel reciprocity, MCS and rank update based on measured and target error, spatial probing and Null Data Packets.</p>
<p><strong>Licensed Assisted NR-U</strong>: UL always transmitted within a shared COT won by the gNB. The gNB COT won with CAT4 LBT and UL transmissions occur within 16us of the preceding DL transmission. DRS transmitted with CAT4 LBT with the access priority of Voice.</p>
<p><strong>Configuration 1:</strong> NR-U LBT is ED-only with ED = -72dBm and no LBT in the 16us gap before UL transmission within the gNB COT.</p>
<p><strong>Configuration 2:</strong> NR-U LBT is ED-only with ED = -72dBm and fixed duration LBT with ED = -72dBm in the 16us gap before UL transmission within the gNB COT.</p>
<p><strong>Configuration 3:</strong>NR-U LBT consists of ED = -62dBm and PD = -82dBm and fixed duration LBT with ED = -62dBm in the 16us gap before UL transmission within the gNB COT.</p>
<p>NR-U assumptions: SCS 30KHz, MCOT 6ms for UL and 8ms for DL for best effort, and 2ms for DL/UL for VoIP.</p></td>
