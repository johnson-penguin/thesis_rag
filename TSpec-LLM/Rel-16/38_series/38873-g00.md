4 Background
============

On April 21^st^ 2015, the FCC released a Report and Order (R&O) and
Second Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (Second FNPRM) to establish
new rules for commercial use of the 3550-3700 MHz band. This framework
creates a contiguous 150 MHz block at 3550 -- 3700 MHz (3.5 GHz) for
mobile broadband that FCC calls \"Citizens Broadband Radio Service
(CBRS)\" and regulated under new Part 96 of FCC's Rules. On May 2^nd^
2016, a second R&O and Order on Reconsideration was released by FCC to
finalize the rules. On October 24, 2018, the FCC released an Order
revising the licensing and technical rules in the CBRS band.

**The objective of the Work Item is to specify a new NR TDD operating
band (3550 -- 3700 **MHz) with support of the following SCS and
bandwidths (for PC3 power class only):

5 Frequency band arrangements and regulatory background
=======================================================

The 3550 -- 3700 MHz band plan is shown in Figure 5.1. The adjacent 3700
-- 4200 MHz band is used by C-Band Fixed Satellite Services Earth
Stations. On the lower side, the band 3100-3550MHz is used by US
Department of Defense (DoD) for operating various types of shipborne,
land-based, and aeronautical mobile radar systems.

Figure 5.1: Band plan

Summary of the FCC's rules relevant to RAN4 work to define a new band
for US 3.5GHz band are provided below:

*3.5 GHz Emissions and Interference Limits:*

\(1\) *General protection levels.* Except as otherwise specified below,
for CBSD channel and frequency assignments, the conducted power of any
CBSD emission outside the fundamental emission (whether in or outside of
the authorized band) shall not exceed -13 dBm/MHz within 0-10 megahertz
above the upper assigned channel edge and within 0-10 megahertz below
the lower assigned channel edge. At all frequencies greater than 10
megahertz above the upper assigned channel edge and less than 10 MHz
below the lower assigned channel edge, the conducted power of any CBSD
emission shall not exceed -25 dBm/MHz. The upper and lower assigned
channel edges are the upper and lower limits of any channel assigned to
a CBSD, or in the case of multiple contiguous channels, the upper and
lower limits of the combined contiguous channels.

For channel and frequency assignments made by a CBSD to End User
Devices, the conducted power of any End User Device emission outside the
fundamental emission (whether in or outside of the authorized band)
shall not exceed -13 dBm/MHz within 0 to B megahertz (where B is the
bandwidth in megahertz of the assigned channel or multiple contiguous
channels of the End User Device) above the upper CBSD-assigned channel
edge and within 0 to B megahertz below the lower CBSD-assigned channel
edge. At all frequencies greater than B megahertz above the upper CBSD
assigned channel edge and less than B megahertz below the lower
CBSD-assigned channel edge, the conducted power of any End User Device
emission shall not exceed -25 dBm/MHz. Notwithstanding the emission
limits in this paragraph, the Adjacent Channel Leakage Ratio for End
User Devices shall be at least 30 dB.

\(2\) *Addi*tional protection levels: the conducted power of emissions
below 3540 MHz or above 3710 MHz shall not exceed -25 dBm/MHz, and the
conducted power of emissions below 3530 MHz or above 3720 MHz shall not
exceed -40dBm/MHz.

Figure 5.2: CBSD & EUD Emission Limits

\(3\) *Measurement procedure*:

\(i\) Compliance with this provision is based on the use of measurement
instrumentation employing a resolution bandwidth of 1 megahertz or
greater. However, in the 1 megahertz bands immediately outside and
adjacent to the licensee\'s authorized frequency channel, a resolution
bandwidth of no less than one percent of the fundamental emission
bandwidth may be employed. A narrower resolution bandwidth is permitted
in all cases to improve measurement accuracy provided the measured power
is integrated over the full reference bandwidth (*i.e.,* 1 MHz or 1
percent of emission bandwidth, as specified). The fundamental emission
bandwidth is defined as the width of the signal between two points, one
below the carrier center frequency and one above the carrier center
frequency, outside of which all emissions are attenuated at least 26 dB
below the transmitter power.

6 Operating band, channel bandwidths, channel numbering
=======================================================

**5.2 Operating bands**

Because in this case E-UTRA band 48 is re-farmed the band number is
re-used.

+-----------------+-----------------+-----------------+-------------+

**5.3 UE channel bandwidth**

From the WID we can determine the Channel bandwidths. Channel bandwidth
of 5 MHz can be used only as a part of DC or CA-configuration as it is
not discoverable in initial acquisition because the synchronization
raster does not support 15 kHz. Channel bandwidths of 50 MHz -- 100 MHz
are listed in WID as applicable only for DL. Furthermore, the WID states
that only symmetric UL/DL bandwidths are defined for non-CA operation,
therefore channel bandwidths of 50 MHz -- 100 MHz can be used only as
Scell in CA-configuration.

**6.2.3 UE additional maximum output power reduction**

NS- signalling is needed due to FCC emission requirements. NS\_27 is
copied from E-UTRA band 48. NS\_100 or NS\_27U is not needed as UTRA is
not deployed in this band.

**7.3.2 Reference sensitivity power level**

n77 and n78 REFSENS is used to allow co-banding. Channel bandwidths
larger than 40 MHz can be used only in CA as these bandwidths are
DL-only therefore the REFSENS can also only be verified in CA mode.

### 7.1.1 A-MPR

#### 7.1.1.1 Vendor A

**Simulation assumptions were as follows**

IQ-Image and LO leakage = 28 dBc

CIM3 = 60 dBc

PA calibration point was 20 MHz, 15 kHz, QPSK, DFT-S-OFMA, 100 RB at
lower channel edge with 0.5 dB MPR

**A-MPR concept and results**

FCC emission requirements are tighter outside of the band compared to
inside the band with an exception that first 10 MHz on high side of that
band has same -13 dBm requirement as within the band. Therefore, it
would be beneficial to define two different A-MPRs firstly the band edge
A-MPR which has higher -25 dBm\...-40 dBm emission requirement on IMD3
region and secondly an inner-band A-MPR which would have lower A-MPR as
-13 dBm requirement would apply on IMD3 region. This concept is
presented in Figure.

Figure 7.1.1.1-1: Two different A-MPRs per CH BW

Based on concept presented in Figure 7.1.1.1-1 we provide simulation
results in Tables 7.1.1.1-1 and 7.1.1.1-2 below. Total UE output power
backoff is max(MPR, A-MPR).

As can be seen from results presented in Table 7.1.1.1-2 our results
indicate there is no need to specify A-MPR for A1, A2, A4, A6 inner and
A8 inner scenarios. A-MPR needed for A6 and A8 outer allocations is
limited to only few modulations. For A5 there is an A-MPR need for many
modulations but additive backoff compared to MPR is 1.5 -- 3 dB. A8
requires always substantial A-MPR.

**6.6.4.2.5.3 Additional operating band unwanted emissions limits for
Band n48**

The following requirement may apply to BS operating in Band n48 in
certain regions. Emissions shall not exceed the maximum levels specified
in Table 6.6.4.2.5.3-1.

Table 6.6.4.2.5.3-1: Additional operating band unwanted emission limits
for Band n48

  Channel bandwidth   Frequency offset of measurement filter ‑3dB point, ∆f   Frequency offset of measurement filter centre frequency, f\_offset   Minimum requirement   Measurement bandwidth (Note)

  ------------------- ------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------------- ------------------------------

Note: The resolution bandwidth of the measuring equipment should be
equal to the measurement bandwidth. However, to improve measurement
accuracy, sensitivity and efficiency, the resolution bandwidth may be
smaller than the measurement bandwidth. When the resolution bandwidth is
smaller than the measurement bandwidth, the result should be integrated
over the measurement bandwidth in order to obtain the equivalent noise
bandwidth of the measurement bandwidth.
