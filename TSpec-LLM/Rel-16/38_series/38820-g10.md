 1 Scope
=======

The present document is a technical report for the study item on 7.125
-- 24.250 GHz frequency range, covering the regulatory framework study,
general RF aspects, as well as BS- and UE-specific aspects.

During the NR study item in Rel-14, frequency range of 6 -- 24 GHz was
discussed as part of the RAN WG4 studies. This frequency range was
included within the Rel-14 study item objectives and the operational
requirements for Next Generation access technologies described in TR
38.913 \[2\].

As the frequencies below 7.125 GHz and above 24.25 GHz (i.e. up to 52.6
GHz) were already addressed in Rel‑15 NR specifications, the discussion
on the 7 - 24 GHz intermediate range was triggered at later stage.

NOTE 1: During Rel-15 work on NR frequency bands, the FR1 frequency
range was initially defined up to 6 GHz. At later stage of Rel-15, the
FR1 was agreed at RAN\#82 meeting to be extended up to 7.125 GHz in
order to incorporate the NR-U work and potential licensed operation.

NOTE 2: For simplicity purposes, whenever the term "7 -- 24 GHz" will be
used in this technical report, the frequency range of 7.125 -- 24.250
GHz shall be considered.

This TR intends to provide information on the feasibility of NR
operation in 7 -- 24 GHz frequency range for set of potential deployment
scenarios, considering BS RF and UE RF technology capabilities taking
into account possible ranges for key requirements.

This TR does not intend to provide specific recommendations on NR system
parameter values to be defined, nor specific RF or EMC requirement
values to be defined for UE or BS operation in this frequency range, as
those aspects are considered to be covered by the follow-up WI.

### 4.2.1 Europe and CEPT

General information for usages in CEPT can be found in the European
table of frequency allocations and applications in the frequency range
8.3 kHz to 3000 GHz \[23\]. When it comes to Regulation about Short
Range Devices additional information can be found in Recommendation
ERC/REC 70-03 "Relating to the use of Short Range Devices
(SRD)"(\*) \[32\]. Where a corresponding EC decision exists it is marked
with (^+^). Unwanted emission limits can be found in ECC Recommendation
(02)/05 "Unwanted Emissions" \[33\] and ERC/RECOMMENDATION 74-01
"Unwanted emissions in the spurious domain" \[34\].

4.4 WRC-19 outcomes 
-------------------

In this clause summary of the WRC-19 conclusions related to the IMT in 7
-- 24 GHz range and applicable deployment scenarios is provided.

### 4.4.1 New agenda items for WRC-23

Based on the discussion on the new agenda items for WRC-23 conference,
resolution COM6/1 (i.e. *Agenda for the 2023 world radiocommunication
conference*) as in the WRC-19 Provisional Final Acts report \[59\] was
agreed during WRC‑19, including the following considerations:

+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| > *1.2 to consider identification of the frequency bands 3 300-3 400 |
| > MHz, 3 600-3 800 MHz, 6 425-7 025 MHz, 7 025-7 125 MHz and         |
| > 10.0-10.5 GHz for International Mobile Telecommunications (IMT),   |
| > including possible additional allocations to the mobile service on |
| > a primary basis, in accordance with Resolution COM6/2 (WRC-19);*   |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------+

Based on the above identified frequency ranges for IMT, possible
additional allocations to the mobile services on a primary basis are to
be discussed for 7 -- 24 GHz range during WRC-23 in the following
frequency range: 10.0 -- 10.5 GHz (Region 2).

Further referring to the resolution COM6/2 in \[59\] (i.e. *Studies on
frequency-related matters for the terrestrial component of International
Mobile Telecommunications identification in the frequency bands*),
WRC-19 recognized to conduct and complete in time for WRC-23 the sharing
and compatibility studies with a view to ensuring protection of serviced
to which the frequency band is allocated on a primary basis, without
imposing additional regulatory or technical constraints on those
services, and also, as appropriate, on services in adjacent bands, for
the above listed band 10.0 -- 10.5 GHz.

+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| > *2 to conduct and complete in time for WRC-23 the sharing and      |
| > compatibility studies1, with a view to ensuring the protection of  |
| > services to which the frequency band is allocated on a primary     |
| > basis, without imposing additional regulatory or technical         |
| > constraints on those services, and also, as appropriate, on        |
| > services in adjacent bands, for the frequency bands:*              |
| >                                                                    |
| > *-- 3 600-3 800 MHz and 3 300-3 400 MHz (Region 2);*               |
| >                                                                    |
| > *-- 3 300-3 400 MHz (amend footnote in Region 1);*                 |
| >                                                                    |
| > *-- 7 025-7 125 MHz (globally);*                                   |
| >                                                                    |
| > *-- 6 425-7 025 MHz (Region 1);*                                   |
| >                                                                    |
| > *-- 10 000-10 500 MHz (Region 2),*                                 |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------+

### 4.4.2 IMT for fixed wireless broadband in fixed services bands

WRC-19 resolution COM6/1 in \[59\] concludes that WRC-23 shall consider
and approve the report of the Director of the Radiocommunication Bureau,
including the following:

+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| > *Study the use of International Mobile Telecommunication system    |
| > for fixed wireless broadband in the frequency bands allocated to   |
| > the fixed services on primary basis, in accordance with Resolution |
| > COM6/18 (WRC-19);*                                                 |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------+

In particular the above resolution includes reference to the resolution
COM6/18 in \[59\] on study of IMT system for fixed wireless broadband in
the frequency bands allocated to the fixed services on primary basis:

+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| > *to conduct any necessary studies on the use of International      |
| > Mobile Telecommunication systems for fixed wireless broadband in   |
| > the frequency bands allocated to the fixed service on primary      |
| > basis,* COM6/18 in \[59\].                                         |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------+

The above referred resolution COM6/18 \[59\] further recognizes (among
others) that:

+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| > *that the ITU-R Handbook on "Fixed Wireless Access" addressed the  |
| > use of International Mobile Telecommunication (IMT) systems for    |
| > Fixed Wireless Access, and Recommendation ITU-R M.819 contains     |
| > specific requirements pertaining to fixed wireless access,*        |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------+

It shall be observed, that the above referred ITU-R Handbook and ITU-R
recommendation M.819 \[66\] are Fixed Wireless Access (FWA) specific,
while the resolution COM6/18 refers to the "fixed wireless broadband".
This terminology inconsistency may require further clarifications and
studies on their applicability and deployment scenario assumptions. Such
studies are considered to be out of scope of this study item.

The above text from COM6/18 in \[59\] is found to be applicable to the 7
-- 24 GHz range where multiple fixed wireless broadband systems were
deployed as fixed services on primary basis.

It is expected that results of the above studies will be reported to the
WRC-23 conference.

5 Study on general aspects
==========================

5.1 General
-----------

This clause provides discussion on general aspects of the 7 -- 24 GHz
frequency range study item applicable to both UE and BS studies, unless
otherwise stated.

5.2 Selection of frequency sub-ranges and example frequencies
-------------------------------------------------------------

The performance trends related to vital components and technologies to
be used within the frequency range 7 -- 24 GHz indicates that the
frequency range needs to be split up into frequency sub-ranges, each
with one example frequency selected. The intension with the example
frequencies is that the technology evaluation is supposed to be
performed per example frequency. The selected frequency sub-ranges and
example frequencies are listed in table 5.2-1.

+----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+

The above frequency sub-ranges were selected only for purpose of RF
technology analyses during this SI and shall not be confused with
potential new NR frequency range(s) (as compared to the existing FR1 or
FR2 defined for NR) and band plan which could be defined by RAN4 in
harmonization with other services for NR in future.

In case outcomes of the RF requirement analyses will be found as
sufficiently similar across adjacent example ranges, RAN4 may consider
merging them towards conclusion on FR1/FR2 extension and/or new FR range
introduction, in the follow-up WI.

5.3 Comparison of FR1 and FR2 characteristics
---------------------------------------------

### 5.3.1 General

In a RAN4 context, there is a very substantial difference between the
technology characteristics and system behaviors for FR1 and FR2
spectrum. Within RAN4, the understanding of what is meant with FR1 and
FR2 differs between the base station RF specifications, the UE RF
specifications and the RRM specifications. Furthermore, RAN1 and RAN2
have also used the terms FR1 and FR2 to refer to signaling concepts and
types of UE and network behavior. Thus, terms "FR1" and "FR2" imply
certain characteristics or types of behavior.

During related future WI when considering specific operating bands
within 7 -- 24 GHz range, other working groups besides RAN4 would need
to confirm whether FR1 or FR2 behavior and requirements can be reused or
whether something new is needed. RAN4 would need to consider the
applicability of requirements, as well as requirement values. If the
requirements correspond sufficiently to FR1 or FR2, extension of the FR
may be preferred. Already now we have different RF requirements within
the same FR, e.g. different ACLR in 28 GHz and 39 GHz frequencies. If
there would be large deviations, a strategy for dealing with the
deviations would be needed (e.g. creation of sub-FR, defining new FR, or
similar) that could be applied consistently across the working groups to
develop the necessary descriptions of requirements, functionality,
signaling, etc.

#### 5.3.1.1 RAN1 specification impacts

The RAN1 specifications differentiate FR1 and FR2 in the following
aspects:

\- TS 38.211 \[13\]: Random access configuration depends on FR1/FR2.
Transition times RXTX and TXRX depend on FR1/FR2. OffsetToPointA unit
depends on FR1/FR2.

\- TS 38.213 \[14\]: SSB pattern and cell search depend on FR1/FR2.
Power control aspects for dual connectivity depend on FR1/FR2. BWP
switching in RA procedure depends on FR1/FR2. Actions related to
bwp-InactivityTimer in BWP switching depend on FR1/FR2. Type0-PDCCH
monitoring behaviour depends on FR1/FR2.

\- TS 38.214 \[15\]: Different behaviour w.r.t. overlapping reception of
unicast PDSCH and SI-PDSCH. FR2 supports TRS in single slot. PT-RS
support is different w.r.t. FR1/FR2. PDSCH and PUSCH processing
capability 2 is only defined for FR1. FR1 supports almost contiguous
allocation for UL CP-OFDM while FR2 does not.

An important question for 7 -- 24 GHz range is whether all of the
impacted RAN1 procedures are the same as for FR1 or FR2, or whether it
is the case that some procedures are like one of the FRs and other
procedures are more like the other FR, or different to either FR. If the
latter is the case (i.e. not all procedures can be inherited from an
FR), then a new FR seems needed, whereas if the latter is the case then
from a RAN1 perspective the FR could be extended.

#### 5.3.1.2 RAN2 specification impacts

FR1 and FR2 differ in terms of requirements and functionality. This
implies that if the total functionality in a band in the 7 -- 24 GHz
range does not correspond exactly to FR1 or to FR2 then the RRC
signaling may need to differ. Furthermore, signaling of parameters may
need to differ in case the parameter values do not correspond directly
to FR1 or FR2 in all cases.

Based on input from RAN1 and RAN4, RAN2 distinguishes FR1 and FR2 both
in the (interpretation of) UE capability signaling as well as in the
(interpretation of) DL configuration messages. If the 7 -- 24 GHz range
would be introduced as e.g. a new FR3, RAN2 specifications would need to
be updated. In some cases it may just be and textual amendment ("in FR1
and FR3") but in other cases it will require new fields or entire
branches in RRC signaling. If most properties of the new frequency range
differ from FR1 and FR2 or if some are like in FR1 and others like in
FR2, a new term may anyway be preferable. In case of the latter, RAN2
will have to discuss and incorporate many changes. Planning of work
items should account for that.

However, if the new frequency range would inherit most of its properties
from either FR1 or FR2, it would be preferably from signaling point of
view to reuse those existing terms (and hence the signaling structure).
This would minimize the changes to the RAN2 specifications and hence the
work-load and possibly also the time to market.

#### 5.3.1.3 RAN4 specification impacts

##### 5.3.1.3.1 General

The FR categorization has some impact on general system parameters in
RAN4. For example, the set of channel bandwidths and subcarrier spacings
that can be applicable. The specific BW~Channel~ and SCS are specified
on a band specific basis but must be a subset of the BS/SCS defined for
the applicable frequency range.

##### 5.3.1.3.2 BS RF

In the BS RF specifications (i.e. TS 38.104 \[5\], TS 38.141-1 \[16\],
TS 38.141-2 \[6\]), apart from the frequencies of bands, the term
frequency range encompasses aspects of requirement concept and design,
requirement levels and test methodologies.

Requirement concept and design differs for the TDD OFF power
requirement, where a co-location type requirement is applicable for all
FR1 bands and a TRP/EIRP requirement for FR2 bands.

The concept for receiver requirements differs substantially. For all FR1
bands, RX requirements are based on base conducted values that are
scaled with a virtual gain. For FR2 bands, the reference sensitivity
level is declared within a specific range, and other interferer levels
are relative to that value.

For all FR1 bands, co-location requirements are specified, whereas for
FR2 bands, there are no co-location requirements. The set of performance
requirements differ depending on whether the band is an FR1 or FR2 band.

##### 5.3.1.3.3 UE RF

In the UE RF specifications (TS 38.101-1 \[17\], TS 38.101-2 \[18\], TS
38.101-3 \[19\]), the major difference between FR1 and FR2 is that for
FR1, requirements are defined and tested as conducted, whereas for FR2
OTA definitions and tests are applied. As a consequence of the OTA
testing, in FR2 some additional requirements on spherical coverage and
beam correspondence are included that are not applicable for FR1.

Apart from the OTA aspects, the requirement concept and applicability
between FR1 and FR2 is in general more similar for the UE than for the
BS. FR1 includes some additional blocking requirements compared to FR2.
Handling of duty cycle and power back off for EMC & absorption
regulatory compliance differs between the two ranges.

Requirement values differ between FR1 and FR2. Some requirements are
band specific and others frequency range specific.

##### 5.3.1.3.4 RRM

The main difference in RRM specification TS 38.133 \[20\] between FR1
and FR2 UEs is that FR1 UEs are not assumed to perform RX beam sweeping,
whereas RX beam sweeping is necessary for FR2 handover which leads to
longer delays in requirements (larger multipliers for SMTC periodicity).
In addition, the UE cannot simultaneously perform analogue beamforming
towards the serving cell and RX beam sweeping so there are various
scheduling restrictions specified in TS 38.133 \[20\] for FR2 operations
to allow the UE to beam sweep.

Thus, there is a need to consider both whether beam sweeping is
required, and how likely it is that the restriction is needed.

There are also differences in other aspects of RRM requirements such as
UE measurement capabilities (e.g. minimum number of SSB that the UE
shall be capable of measuring), however these are more a consequence of
different parameterization of the physical layer (up to L = 64 TX beams
are possible in FR2) rather than fundamentally different operations and
requirements.

Hence, when considering a frequency band in the range 7 -- 24 GHz the
fundamental questions which need to be answered from an RRM perspective
are:

\- Whether RX beam sweeping is used, and if so, how does it differ from
the existing RX beam sweeping operation assumed for FR2.

\- At what frequency is it feasible to operate a UE without RX beam
sweeping.

The answers to these questions would determine the extent to which
existing FR1 or FR2 requirements could be reused in the 7 -- 24 GHz
range, and how the existing requirements could be modified to make them
applicable to bands in 7 -- 24 GHz range.

### 5.3.2 Transmitter architecture

It is generally assumed that FR1 BS adopt a BB beam forming architecture
in addition to using digital adaptive pre-distortion to linearize the
transmitter and that FR2 BS use analogue, digital or hybrid beam forming
and does not use linearization. Whilst different architectures decisions
may go together, they are not dependent on each other but are both
dependent on a similar set of technical parameters.

Low frequencies lend themselves to both BB beam forming and digital
linearization as they have the following characteristics:

\- Antennas size and hence No of elements is limited by the physical
size.

\- Power amplifiers can be high power.

\- Operating band widths are small (compared to FR2).

As such a separate transmitter chain from BB to antenna element is
feasible.

For a base station the principle transmitter architecture is visualised
in figure 5.3.2-1.![](media/image3.emf){width="6.695138888888889in"
height="2.6284722222222223in"}

Figure 5.3.2-1: Reference architecture of base station TX

Based on the implementation the number of interfaces between the
sub-systems may vary. The parameters in the reference architecture is
described in table 5.3.2-1.

**Table 5.3.2-1: Port parameters**

  **Parameters**   **Interface**                **Description**
  ---------------- ---------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  *N~LP~*          BB                           Number of supported logical ports defined in RAN1 specifications
  *N~BB~*          internal                     Number of I/Q data transmitter streams feed to DACs in the transceiver array
  *N~RF~*          Transceiver array boundary   Number of RF connectors at the transceiver array boundary
  *N~AE~*          internal                     Number of RF transmission lines to antenna array

The relations between the number of interfaces, can be used to
discriminate between different beamforming approaches as described in
table 5.3.2-2.

**Table 5.3.2-2: Beamforming concepts**

![](media/image4.emf){width="3.201388888888889in" height="2.9375in"}

Figure 5.3.2-2: Example of digital beam forming architecture

Because each PA has a path from the digital processing domain
implementing digital pre-distortion is possible, the relatively small
bandwidths of the operating bands mean that converters are feasible and
also the high power of the PA means that the energy saved in linearizing
the PA is greater than the energy used in implementing that
linearization.

At high frequencies the individual PA power is much lower, in addition
the antenna array size and the number of elements is no longer governed
by the physical size of the array. Larger path losses at higher
frequencies mean that higher gain antennas are more important. As such
FR2 arrays tend to have a larger number of lower powered PA's. In this
case operating a separate path from digital processing domain to
antennas becomes complex and hence hybrid beam forming architectures are
assumed.

![](media/image5.emf){width="3.298611111111111in"
height="3.0416666666666665in"}

Figure 5.3.2-3: Example of hybrid beam forming architecture

As the beam forming is done in the RF it is not possible to individually
digital pre-distort each PA in addition the wide operating and channel
bandwidths mean that generating 3 to 5 times the bandwidth from the
digital-to-analogue converters starts to become impractical and the
relatively lower power saved per PA means the power saving compared to
the power used in the lineariser is not attractive. Hence it is
currently assumed digital linearization is assumed to be not used for
FR2.

For both FR1 and FR2 however these are assumptions are not used for
requirement setting, the antenna size, number of and power of the PA's
is assumed when investigating co-existence but the beam forming and
linearization architectures are not important at this level.

For the 7 -- 24 GHz region it is likely that implementation will change
from a digital beam forming architecture to a hybrid beam forming or
analogue beamforming architecture at some frequency in this range
however this is not relevant to the requirement setting. As with FR1 and
FR2 the size, number of and PA power rating assumptions are required to
estimate typical OTA performance when studying co-existence, but the
requirement do not need to make any assumption on how the beam forming
is achieved or how or if the PA's are linearized.

5.4 RF technology considerations in the 7 -- 24 GHz range
---------------------------------------------------------

### 5.4.1 PA trends

For 7 -- 24 GHz frequency range, it is essential to perform in-depth
analysis of power amplifiers based on different semi-conductor
technologies. In addition, complex relation between output power, ACLR
(linearity) and efficiency is an important aspect considering the
performance and feasibility for example frequencies.

The PA technology and trends are based on professor Hua Wang \[11\] work
where a large power amplifier survey consisting of more than 3200 data
points with over 1200 data points for CMOS, SiGe PAs and over 1500 power
amplifier data points has been collected for GaN, GaAs, InP. Wang's
database covers published results, both from the open literature, as
well as commercial amplifiers from various vendors.

Based on the information from \[11\], the PA database information was
summarized for all the considered RF technologies in figure 5.4.1-1. It
can be observed that based on the available information, there is no
data for the LDMOS technology for the 7 -- 24 GHz range, while the InP
technology data is available from 20 GHz upwards.

![](media/image6.png){width="7.165972222222222in"
height="3.9944444444444445in"}

**Figure 5.4.1-1: Saturated output power versus frequency (red box
depicts 7 -- 24 GHz range) \[11\]**

In order to derive more accurate PA trends, all the figures below were
plotted with PA operating frequencies much wider then just 7 -- 24 GHz
range. More detailed technology-specific plots (e.g. PAE vs. Psat, or
Psat vs. frequency) can be found in the Excel sheet capturing all the PA
survey data in \[11\].

Based on the analysis of the achievable Psat trends over the 7 -- 24 GHz
range, the saturated output power maximum trend values for 7.125 GHz and
24.25 GHz from \[11\] were listed in table 5.4.1-1, further extended
with additional extrapolated values. It may be noted here that trend of
SiGe BiCMOS PA in figure 5.4.1-1 is limited to 10 GHz frequency. If the
trend line is extrapolated down to 7 GHz then Pout of 36 dBm is
expected.

The following analysis covers the saturated peak output power and power
added efficiency (PAE). It should be noted that for all presented
characteristics, the results are based on peak power, non-linearized
power amplifiers without considering the bandwidth impact to show the
trends with respect to frequency for different technologies.

#### 5.4.1.1 Saturated peak output power

Based on material in \[9\] a more comprehensive analysis of achievable
power amplifier performance has been investigated. In figure 5.4.1.1-1,
a scatter diagram of saturated output power as a function of operating
frequency for silicon technologies is shown. The technologies are
grouped in three categories: LDMOS, CMOS and SiGe. The attainable output
power at a given operating frequency is limited by the saturated
electron velocity and the breakdown field strength in a given
semiconductor material. This is captured in Johnsons' figure of merit
which states that the maximum output power will decrease with 20
dB/decade as the operating frequency is increased. The black line
conveys the limitation due to Johnsons' figure of merit.

height="2.923611111111111in"}Figure 5.4.1.1-2 presents the maximum
output power as function of operating frequency for two compound
semiconductor technologies: GaAs and GaN. Higher output power can be
achieved but would necessitate excessive power combining associated with
decreased operating efficiency.

Figure 5.4.1.1-2: Saturated output power versus frequency for GaAs and
GaN (red box depicts 7 -- 24 GHz range)

For PA operating within the 7 -- 24 GHz frequency range the trends can
be summarized as:

\- Silicon technologies are limited to maximum 2 W of peak power.

\- With GaN technology the peak output power can be increased to maximum
20 W peak power (at 24 GHz).

#### 5.4.1.2 Power added efficiency

Based on material in \[9\] a more comprehensive analysis of achievable
power amplifier performance has been investigated for PAE. In figure
5.4.1.2-1, a scatter diagram of peak power added efficiency as function
of operating frequency for power amplifiers made using silicon
transistors (i.e. LDMOS, CMOS and SiGe).

![](media/image11.png){width="3.1in" height="2.54in"}

Figure 5.4.1.2-1: Peak power added efficiency versus frequency for
LDMOS, CMOS and SiGe (red box depicts 7 -- 24 GHz range)

In figure 5.4.1.2-2 the same parameters are plotted for compound
semiconductor transistors (i.e. GaAs and GaN). As expected PAE is mainly
dependent on the operating frequency and not the transistor technology.
The wide spread of data is mainly due to different power levels and
different amplifier architectures (e.g. class-A, class-AB, Doherty
etc.).

![](media/image14.png){width="3.25in" height="2.423611111111111in"}

Figure 5.4.1.2-2: Peak power added efficiency versus frequency for GaAs
and GaN (red box depicts 7 -- 24 GHz range)

Grouping power amplifiers in different power categories gives a better
view on the efficiency performance of different semiconductor
technologies.

It should be noted that for all presented characteristics, the results
are based on peak power, non-linearized power amplifiers without
considering the bandwidth impact to show the trends with respect to
frequency for different technologies. The presented characteristic
neither consider practical implementation as the achievable average
power (RMS) would being \~10 dB lower compared to saturated peak power
to fulfil the needed modulation quality (EVM) or possibly necessary
linearization range.

### 5.4.2 PA power scaling and AAS dependencies

The power capability $\text{\ P}_{C}$ (the maximum level of signal power
that can be generated) of a PA is fundamentally governed by the
Johnsons' figure of merit. Once the semiconductor technology has been
chosen (CMOS, SiGe, GaN, etc.) for implementing a power amplifier, the
power capability $\text{\ P}_{C}$ is bounded by
$\text{\ P}_{C} \propto 1/f^{2}$ (-20 dB per decade).

Over the frequency range (7 -- 24 GHz) considered, however, it is not
enough to consider the power capability of single PA. Rather, it may be
justified to assume some sort of multi-antenna arrangement or more
specifically an antenna array, at least for the upper part of the
frequency range. Figure 5.4.2-1 illustrates a conceptual unit area of an
antenna array with N elements and will be used to support the discussion
below. Here, the array is a uniform array (equidistant distance between
elements) and without lack of generality one PA is associated with
respective element.

One may rightfully say that the antenna element separation *d* is
constant over frequency when measured in wavelengths $\lambda$, e.g.
0.5$\lambda$. Consequently, the antenna separation measured in meters
will scale as $1/f$ where $f$ is the target RF frequency for which the
antenna array has been designed, and thus the number of elements per
unit area $N$ will be $\  \propto f^{2}$ (+20 dB per decade).

The DC power provided to drive one power amplifier is $P_{\text{DC}}$
and the DC power provided to the unit area equals$:$

$$P_{\text{DC},\text{UA}} = N{\ P}_{\text{DC}}$$

Correspondingly, the RF power generated by one PA is
$P_{\text{RF}} = \text{PAE\ P}_{\text{DC}}$ where $\text{PAE}$ is the
efficiency of the PA, and the RF power generated by the unit area is
$P_{RF,UA} = N\text{\ P}_{\text{RF}} = \text{N\ PAE\ P}_{\text{DC}}$
(the exact definition of $\text{PAE}$ also includes the PA input signal
power but this is left out here for simplicity).

Figure 5.4.2-1: Relation between power, number of elements and frequency
of operation

If PAE and ACLR had been constant over frequency, a constant DC power
per unit area (irrespective of frequency) would obviously imply that the
RF power per unit area $P_{RF,UA}$ would also be constant over
frequency, as the power capability per PA scales -20 dB/decade while the
number of antenna elements scales as +20 dB/decade.

For FR2 ACLR is 28 dB but it is expected that it should improve towards
lower frequencies, given the substantially higher ACLR for FR1. The aim
of this discussion is to present one such scaling mechanism.

A trend of -5 dB/decade ($1/\sqrt{f}$) was identified for PAE based on
empirical data at peak power. It is expected that this scaling also
applies when operating in back-off. With a cap on DC power per unit
area, such a trend would allow for more RF power per unit area with a
preserved ACLR for lower frequencies, i.e. increasing by 5 dB when
lowering the frequency by one decade. This exemplified in figure 5.4.2-2
(constant ACLR) for power levels referring to one PA.

Alternatively, one can assume a constant DC as well as constant RF power
per unit area and let the Pas towards lower frequencies operate at a
lower PAE, to instead allow a higher ACLR, see figure 5.4.2-2 (improved
ACLR). Exploiting this to its full extent means that all the
$\text{PAE}$ improvement for lower frequencies is translated to an
equivalent reduction of RF power per PA compared to the RF power per PA
for a given ACLR. The basic analysis in \[2\], backed up by PA
simulations, showed that ACLR improves by roughly 2 dB for every dB of
RF power reduction for a given PA in the ACLR performance regime of
interest.

Example: An array operating at 30 GHz provides ACLR of 28 dB. An array
operating at 15 GHz with the same DC and RF power per unit area will
have an ACLR of 28 + 2·5·log~10~(30/15) = 31 dB.

Figure 5.4.2-2: Illustration of PA power metrics vs frequency for
constant ACLR vs improved ACLR (towards lower frequencies)

The analysis outlined above is based on one PA per antenna element, or
at least the same sub-array configuration, over the frequency range
considered. Although larger sub-array configurations may be used at
lower frequencies the general principle still holds. For example, an
array of elements based on 1x1 sub-arrays has a certain RF power
$P_{\text{RF}}$ associated with one element and consequently one
sub-array. The same array of elements but based on 8x1 sub-arrays will
have an RF power of ${8P}_{\text{RF}}$ per sub-array. The only
difference lies in that the PA driving the sub-array must be capable of
producing a higher level of RF power to drive the 4x1 sub-array compared
to the 1x1 sub-array. And this is where the more costly by also more
capable technologies come into the picture, e.g. GaN and GaAs, which may
provide up to an order of magnitude higher power levels compared to
Si-based technologies. So, as far as RF and DC power is concerned the
scaling still applies. But using GaN and GaAs technologies also provide
a somewhat higher PAE and it can be argued that this can be used to
further increase the ACLR somewhat towards the lower end of the
frequency range when the PAE benefit has been quantified.

### 5.4.3 PA Output power, ACLR and PAE dependencies

The current technological capability to achieve a certain average output
power level at a prescribed ACLR level for power amplifiers operating in
a weakly non-linear regime (e.g. in back-off), the relation between the
3^rd^ order intercept point (IP3) and ACLR can be used. For an OFDM
signal with a large number of sub-carriers (more than 10) the average
output power as function of targeted ACLR can be calculated from:

$$P_{\text{out}} = \text{IP}3\ –\ \frac{1}{2}\left( \text{ACLR}\  + \ 1.3\ –\ 6 \right)$$

If the IP3 levels are not available they can be estimated from the 1dB
gain compression point, and the average output power can then be
calculated as:

$$P_{\text{out}} = 9.6\, + P1\text{dB}\, - \,\frac{1}{2}\left( \text{ACLR}\, + \, 1.3\, - \, 6 \right)$$

In figure 5.4.3-1 the peak power added efficiency is plotted versus 1-dB
output power compression point (P1dB) for amplifiers operating between
10 GHz to 30 GHz. Considering available data (see figure 5.4.1-1 and
5.4.1-2), a reasonable trade-off between linearity and efficiency is
achieved around a P1 dB of 100 mW (with associated peak PAE of \> 40%).
This observation holds regardless of semiconductor technology. In figure
5.4.3-2 the effect on achievable ACLR of the efficiency -- linearity
trade-off is investigated. Three typical points from the maximum
P1dB-PAE trajectory is chosen: P1dB = 10 dBm, 17 dBm and 20 dBm. For
each point the ACLR is computed as function of average output power. The
PAE numbers given in the figure are indicative of the average PAE
resulting from the peak PAE for these example points (4%, 5% and 6%)
under the assumption that the amplifiers operate in class-A.

Figure 5.4.3-2: Average output power as function of ACLR with PAE as
parameter

To verify the relations between output power vs. ACLR, we re-use to the
results and approach derived earlier in the work for FR2 based on
simulations of a GaN and a CMOS PA, both designed for operation around
30 GHz. Similar to the FR2 approach where the PA models at 45 GHz and 70
GHz FR2 proxy frequencies used the same nonlinear characteristics but
with the output power scaled as -20 dB/decade while PAE scaled as -6
dB/decade, the same approach has been used for 7 -- 24 GHz example
frequencies. The results for relation between output power and ACLR as
well as ACLR vs PAE for example frequencies of 10 GHz, 15 GHz and 20 GHz
are presented in figure 5.4.3-3 and figure 5.4.3-4 respectively, but now

frequencies, and 30 GHz based on 30 GHz PA model for reference. Constant
PAE for CMOS and GaN PA, respectively, also shown

As discussed in clause 5.4.2, assuming the DC power as well as the RF
power associated with the Pas should be constant per antenna array unit
area, the PAE scaling of -5 dB/decade can be exploited to a yield a -10
dB/decade ACLR scaling. Thus, from 30 GHz to 20, 15, 10 GHz, PAE should
improve by 0.9, 1.5, 2.4 dB and consequently the ACLR can be improved by
1.8, 3.0, 4.8 dB.

5.4.4 Filtering aspects

In order to meet out of band emissions requirements, analogue filters
are typically needed. Filters are thus an important block in the
transceiver chain.

Due to limited size (area/volume) and level of integrations needed for
AAS BS types for 7 -- 24 GHz frequency range (i.e. *BS type x~FR~-H* or
*BS type x~FR~-O*), filtering can pose a significant challenge.
Traditional discrete filters are likely to be far too bulky to be fitted
in limited size and difficult to embed into highly integrated systems
(although may be suitable for *BS type x~FR~-C* implementations), and
thus more advanced technologies are needed. It is important to
understand the properties of filter technologies when considering the
relationship between achievable output power, spectrum usage and out of
band requirements.

There are certain fundamental parameter dependencies for filters which
it is useful to consider, as follows:

\- Insertion Losses decreases with increasing BW (for fixed fc).

\- Insertion Losses increases with increasing fc (for fixed BW).

\- Insertion Losses decreases with increasing Q.

\- Insertion Losses increases with increasing N (number of poles).

To better understand the relationships between these parameters, some
estimations of the properties of example filters, with example
bandwidths and emissions requirements were considered.

\- For the example frequency of 20 GHz, attenuation around 20 - 25 dB
was considered.

\- For 15 GHz example frequency the corresponding attenuation level was
30 dB.

It is important to note that the analysis presented here represents very
rough estimates presented for understanding of the trends in filter
performance and the specific numbers should not be relied upon for
future standardization work. The exact attenuation level and filtering
aspects can be further evaluated when future WI based on specific
possible frequency bands and the adjacent systems are known.

In summary, the filter examples investigated imply the need to have
reasonably large guard-band taking to account the tolerances and drift
in frequency due to e.g. temperature etc.

The analysis is focused on LTCC filters as an example, but this is not
the only feasible filter technology. There are other filter technologies
which could be suitable for the 7 -- 24 GHz frequency range such as
ceramic wave-guide filters and air cavity filters which can be further
investigated when in future band specific work items can be studied in
detail.

Based on the example filter characteristics in annex B, filter
parameters for some possible technologies have been collected for
example frequencies in table 5.4.4-1.

The filter parameters can be used as input for decision for numerous RF
parameters relevant for exclusion zones for receiver blocking, emission
and other requirements. It is important to note that there are other
filter technologies which should be also taken into account in future
work.

5.5 Key parameters over the 7 -- 24 GHz range
---------------------------------------------

### 5.5.1 Noise figure

#### 5.5.1.1 General aspects for noise figure 

Receiver Noise Figure (NF) is one of the essential metrics for
determining receiver requirements. For determining typical NF value some
fundamental principles should be considered:

\- The NF is not given by the LNA alone, but also by bandwidth,
linearity and dynamic range dependencies as there is a delicate balance
which should be considered when future requirements are specified.

\- A full RF receiver chain all the way up to radiating elements should
be addressed as all parts in the chain would contribute to the overall
receiver performance including switch (for TDD), routing and filter
losses, etc.

**- For some** compact and highly integrated building practices with
many transceivers and antennas, the power efficiency and heat
dissipation in small area/volume is necessary needs to be considered.

\- As an example, in the context of NF, it might be possible to reduce
the noise contribution from ADC by using more bits, but this would have
significant implication in terms of power consumption and heat
dissipation aspect as a single added bit to ADC would result in four
times higher power consumption. In general the ADC power consumption is
proportional to

BW^2^ · DR~ACD~

> where DR~ACD~ is the ADC dynamic range.

For UE, the typical NF values considering the usage of similar
technologies as for BS, should be similar but slightly higher to allow
more flexibility in the implementation and taking to account the size
limitations.

  NOTE: UE implementation margin can vary. NF value could be revised for higher frequencies. NF value shall not be revised to a value that is higher than the FR2 value.                                      

#### 5.5.1.2 NF analysis for NR BS 

Considering recent state-of-the-art LNA-only noise figure publications
in \[22 -- 27\], figure 5.5.1.2-1 presents the LNA-only noise figure for
different semi-conductor technologies over frequency based on published
data.

Figure 5.5.1.2-1: LNA-only NF trend over frequency

The typical noise figure values presented in figure 5.5.1.2-1 are based
on assumption of pre-LNA noise figure of \~1.8 dB and per example
frequency calculation of losses such as routing losses, etc.

ETSI has published an update of TR 101 854 \[46\] on fixed radio systems
in April 2019, which contains a table on typical NF values and
associated industrial margins (IM~F~) of the radio receivers. This table
is extracted below in table 5.5.1.2-1. The IM~F~ considers various
performance variations of system elements over e.g. temperature
extremes, voltage variations, or aging by capturing production spread of
RF circuits.

NOTE: The above ETSI originated Industrial Margins (IM~F~) shall not be
confused with the Implementation Margins (IM) used in process of RAN4
conformance requirements derivation.

It can be seen from the table above that even though this TR is on fixed
radio systems, the NF and IM~F~ values of the radio receivers are
similar to those that RAN4 has adopted for mobile radio systems
(considering different margins for BS and UE). This would be explained
by the fact that many underlying components would be the same in both
fixed and mobile radio receiver. Since this TR has been officially
published by ETSI, it is reasonable to use the data in the table above
as references for the typical BS NF over the whole 7 -- 24 GHz rang as
shown in table 5.5.1.2-1.

#### 5.5.1.3 NF analysis for NR UE

##### 5.5.1.3.1 General

Receiver architecture (including antenna system) plays an important role
in calculating system NF. At higher frequencies, Active Antenna Systems
(AAS) with antenna arrays and beamforming networks become necessary to
compensate for higher path loss and maintain similar link performance as
lower frequencies \[49\]. Besides, at higher frequencies, AAS are
integrated with the rest of the receive chain in a way that antenna
connectors are no longer available.

It is well known that phase noise degrades at a rate of \~6 dB/octave
with frequency. Since in a zero-IF architecture, RF LO will be at a
higher frequency compared to a super-heterodyne architecture, it will
have higher phase noise and will contribute more to overall system
noise. Note that IF LO in a super-heterodyne architecture will have its
own phase noise contribution. But degradation of phase noise with
frequency combined with other issues related to generating RF LO for
zero-IF architecture at higher frequencies, generally makes RF+IF
down-conversion a more attractive choice at higher frequencies. On the
other hand, a super-heterodyne architecture, even in the absence of any
jammers in the image band, suffers from image band noise and requires
either filtering before the first down conversion or image-reject
downconverter designs.

Other considerations include availability and necessity of analog
filters in RF and their placement in the RF chain.

##### 5.5.1.3.2 Frequency sub-range 1

Zero-IF or direct conversion is the reference architecture for all sub-7
GHz LTE and NR applications \[50\] and is likely to be used for
Frequency sub-range 1 as well.

NF for a reference 6 GHz TDD system is presented in R4-1904127 \[51\].
Since the aim is to compare NF with a single-band mm-wave TDD system, no
antenna switch module for band selection or sub-band duplexing is
accounted for. Furthermore, it is assumed that ADC quantization noise
contributes 0.4 dB to the overall system NF.

But more importantly, the frond-end architecture has a pre-LNA filter
for rejecting out of band jammers and interferers. The presence of
filter is important since in the absence of antenna arrays and
beamforming, it is more likely than not that the UE picks up these types
of jammer during field operation.

"IM" refers to implementation margin of 2.5 dB which is added to account
for process and temperature variations.

Note that some passive technologies such as filters and matching
networks used in FR1, may have degraded performance above 7 GHz \[52\].
Additionally, the above calculation assumes a single band UE, which is
uncommon in sub-7 GHz. While further refinement can be at later stages,
we propose keeping the same NF and using a NF of 9 dB for example
frequency of 10 GHz. This value is lowered from the original proposal of
10 dB from \[6\] due to concerns that the implementation margin was too
high.

##### 5.5.1.3.3 Frequency sub-range 2

The choice of front-end architecture for frequency sub-range 2 is less
certain than for frequency sub-ranges 1 or sub‑range 3:

1\. As far as synthesizer phase noise concerned, frequency sub-range can
end up using either zero-IF or super-heterodyne architectures.

2\. The performance of existing RF connectors is only cited up to 12 GHz
\[54\] and there may in fact be a breakpoint for current RF connector
technologies \[55\], forcing Fequency sub-range 2 to use OTA test
methods.

3\. If link budget shows that antenna arrays are needed, then
beamforming can provide some level of spatial filtering of jammers and
interferers, requiring less or no filter rejection at all.

4\. Compared to frequency sub-range 3 or mm-wave, array elements and
overall size will increase in this frequency sub-range. For example,
while mm-wave can use a 2x8 array, frequency sub-range 2 may be limited
to a 1x4 or smaller array, reducing the array gain and hence
effectiveness of beamforming to reject jammers

5\. On the other hand, if omnidirectional antennas used instead,
filtering becomes necessary.

In either case, the NF will likely be worse than system NF values
proposed for frequency sub-range 1 and sub-range 3. Hence, for RAN4
standardization work, a system NF of 10 dB is proposed for frequency
sub-range 2. This is reduced from the value in \[6\] on concerns that
the implementation margin is too high.

##### 5.5.1.3.4 Frequency sub-range 3

In contrast to sub-7 GHz LTE and NR, at mm-wave frequencies,
super-heterodyne architecture can outperform zero-IF architecture due to
lower LO frequency and superior phase noise \[50\]. Frequency sub-range
3 is more likely to follow suit and use an RF+IF architecture.

In RF+IF architectures, even in the absence of interferers at image
frequency, the thermal noise in the image band is down converted to IF
and contributes to overall system noise figure. If LNA and
down-conversion gain are the same in desired and image bands, thermal
noise in the image band can degrade overall system NF by as much as 3dB
(even though this is unlikely to happen in practice). Therefore, some
mechanism, either in the form of pre-LNA filter or image reject mixer is
necessary to protect the receiver.

While integrated transmission line or LC filters can be used to provide
some rejection of out of band jammers and image band noise, placing then
before the LNA will result in higher NF. Another option is placing the
filter after LNA and before the downconverter. This architecture has
better NF but cannot protect LNA from strong out of band jammers.
However, with beamforming, it is unlikely to have a strong jammer in the
direction of beam peak. So it may even be possible to use no filter at
all and use image reject mixer to protect the receiver from image band
noise. System NF calculations presented in the following two tables are
from \[51\] and are more likely to be used in frequency sub‑range 3.

While the losses will probably be slightly lower at 20 GHz, in
accordance with approved NF values for FR2 \[53\], a NF of 10 dB is
proposed for frequency sub-range 3.

### 5.5.2 Power amplifiers

In clauses 5.4.1.1, 5.4.1.2, 5.4.2 and 5.4.3, the PA trends and
saturated output power, PAE trends, AAS power scaling principles and PA
dependencies respectively are described. The analysis resulted in
example ACLR values without linearization of \~33 dB, \~31 dB and \~30
dB for example frequencies of 10, 15 and 20 GHz respectively. The
example ACLR values do not fully cater for the larger transmission
bandwidths likely for spectrum within 7 -- 24 GHz frequency range and do
not include the effects of any possible linearization applied to the
transmitter chain which would have the effect of improving ACLR.

For 10 GHz example frequency, where an AAS BS may possibly re-use the
existing deployment grid due to propagation condition it would benefit
from higher PA power and high PAE. To investigate the potential
improvements achievable from linearization three different PA's based on
GaN technology from 3 different vendors (vendor A, vendor B and vendor
C) were investigated without and with linearization. The measurements
were performed at \~8 GHz for practical reasons indicating that the
measured results will be slightly worse for \~10 GHz.

Due to possible size of spectrum at higher frequencies, the bandwidth of
200 MHz and 400 MHz corresponding to 2 or 4 carriers, each 100 MHz was
assumed.

The measurement results of the important characteristics are summarized
in table 5.5.2-1.

**Table 5.5.2-1: Measurement results**

+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+
| PA vendor C | 33          | 16.8 / 17   | 32.7 / 23.2 | 42.8 / 24.3 |
+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+

The measured PAE for different PA's are quite aligned with the PAE
analysis in clause 5.4.1.2. Note that the PAE needs to be further
improved in the AAS BS context given the need for fairly high power at
these frequencies.

The result also shows the impact of bandwidth where the achievable ACLR
is lower for 400 MHz bandwidth (which is quite a reasonable bandwidth at
these frequencies), it is not clear if this is a limitation of the
linearizer, the Tx chain or the PA.

Considering the need for a fairly high power and efficiency for these
frequency ranges and the empirical analysis and measurement results, the
achieved ACLR value for 10 GHz example frequency with one example
linearization is around 33 to 35 dB, when the average performance of 200
MHz and 400 MHz channel bandwidth is considered.

### 5.5.3 Phase noise

#### 5.5.3.1 General

Sufficiently low phase noise at the measurement interface is required to
avoid excessive EVM. Based on the available data \[35 -- 40\], a
descriptive BS phase noise profile is shown in figure 5.5.3.1-1. It
shows performance for base stations operating in 7 -- 24 GHz range based
on current (i.e. as of 2019) component data. In the figure each colour
matches to a single component.

It should be noted that throughout this section phase noise is referred
to the observed level at a measurement interface. Noise levels internal
to PLL and clock distribution network may differ from this and
implementation freedom is not limited as described in clause 5.5.3.2. To
account for different reference source performances a range was set from
100 Hz to 1 kHz where reference source can be dominant phase noise
source, as described in clause 5.5.3.3.

For specific use cases where high data rates are targeted, the
performance can be better as shown by the examples of component data. On
the other hand, in cases where device size, power consumption and low
cost are the highest priorities, the phase noise performance may be
worse.

Figure 5.5.3.1-1: A representative phase noise profile for 7 -- 24 GHz
base stations

In figure 5.5.3.1-1 the phase noise profile is shown at 20 GHz example
frequency. To adjust the model to a different frequency, the levels need
to be scaled according to Leeson's equation, i.e. halving the frequency
reduces the noise power to one quarter of the original. When the profile
is given at center frequency f~0~ and a given noise power P~0,~ the
correct noise power P at frequency f equals:

$$P = P_{0}20\log_{10}\left( \frac{f}{f_{0}} \right)$$

, where P and P~0~ describe the full single side-band noise profile for
which the unit is dBc/Hz.

#### 5.5.3.2 LO generation and distribution

Array antenna transceivers may be based on different strategies in
implementation of local oscillator (LO) signal generation and
distribution. Put simply, there are two options:

1\. Centralized LO generation with a single PLL for all transceivers,

2\. Distributed LO generation with one PLL per transceiver.

These are two extreme cases and one could envision a combination of the
two such that the transceivers are grouped together and where the
transceivers within each group shares a common LO generation, i.e.
semi-distributed LO generation.

#### 5.5.3.3 Performance of reference source

To highlight the problem of reference noise increase at lower reference
frequencies due to an increased effective frequency multiplication
factor, the investigation was focused on low power crystal oscillators
at about 40 MHz. At the time of creation of this technical report, there
were not as many publications on crystal oscillator circuits as on PLLs,
but the few papers from recent years in IEEE Journal of Solid-State
Circuits were used to represent state-of-the-art in CMOS low power
crystal oscillators at about 40 MHz.

To span the design space, also the 491.25 MHz crystal oscillator is
included in the table 5.5.3.3-1 summarizing the crystal oscillator
performance.

To translate the phase noise into equivalent phase noise at a PLL
output, an amount equal to $20log(f_{\text{PLL}}/f_{\text{ref}})$ dB
should be added.

Given the above we assume that the crystal oscillator can be made
non-dominant above 1 kHz offset frequency, and that the PLL output phase
noise will have a slope of -30 dB/decade below that frequency. This is
achievable with reference frequencies ranging from 40 MHz to 491 MHz,
and power consumptions below 1 mW, using CMOS technologies as different
as 28 nm and 180 nm.

#### 5.5.3.4 Noise floor

When it comes to the noise floor it is difficult to find published works
that include measurements in this region. Circuit simulations have
therefore been performed to find realistic levels of the noise floor.
The noise floor is typically set not by the oscillator of the PLL, but
by buffers and LO distribution. For this reason, the phase noise of a
chain of inverters acting as buffers was simulated. Three equal sized
cascaded inverters were used for each of the two differential signal
halves, where minimum length devices in a 22 nm technology were used.
The input signal was 1 V peak differential at 20 GHz, and different
width of devices were investigated, corresponding to different amounts
of power consumption. The phase noise is shown in figure 5.5.3.4-1,
where the lowest noise floor of close to -170 dBc/Hz was achieved with a
13.4 mW power consumption, the second-best curve was for 7.5 mW, the
next was 4.2 mW, then 2.4 mW, and finally 1.3 mW. As can be seen -165
dBc/Hz can be reached at about 5 mW buffer power consumption. Taking
attenuation in the LO distribution network into account, it is
reasonable to add some margin to this level.

**Figure 5.5.3.4-1: Phase noise of simulated differential LO buffers in
22 nm technology, ranging from 1.3 mW to 13.4 mW power consumption**

### 5.5.4 Correlation of noise and emissions

With a centralized architecture, i.e. same input distributed to one or
multiple transmit antenna connectors or antenna elements, the
transmitted noise and emissions will be essentially the same, i.e. fully
correlated. The primary downside of this solution is that the
performance requirements will be high. When the composite output, the
signal transmitted into air is formed by more distributed architecture,
i.e. multiple PLLs, multiple PAs and possible non-identical input signal
due to beamforming, each individual component of the composite output
will be partially uncorrelated. This is beneficial from an EVM and
emission requirements perspective as the noise and emissions performance
is improved up to 10log(M) where M is the number of non-correlated
signals.

This may be used to lower the EVM and emissions performance on the
transmitters when they are specified per antenna connector.

5.6 Deployment scenarios
------------------------

Referring to the previous NR discussions, three high level use cases
were defined for NR: eMBB, URLLC and mMTC. Considering NR operation in 7
-- 24 GHz range, the following was observed:

\- eMBB: as 7 -- 24 GHz range is considered to be mostly a capacity
booster, the eMBB is a valid use case for 7 -- 24 GHz range NR
operation.

\- URLLC: this use case includes such advanced services like e.g.
factory automation, autonomous driving, and remote surgery, including
both indoor and outdoor case. Therefore, applicability of the URLLC use
cases in 7 -- 24 GHz required case by case analysis, due to potential
coverage limitation restriction.

\- mMTC: this NR use case requires good penetration, including deep
indoor and wide area coverage. Due to propagation characteristics of 7
-- 24 GHz frequencies, the mMTC use case is not seen as well suited for
7 -- 24 GHz due to potential coverage limitations.

Referring to the NR study item, range of deployment scenarios were
considered and documents in TR 38.913 \[2\], including both FR1 and FR2
spectrum allocations. NR scenarios from TR 38.913 \[2\] were analysed
for the 7 -- 24 GHz applicability, considering the carrier frequency
assumptions. Additionally, IAB scenario was included based on related
Rel-16 work item.

For the 7 -- 24 GHz deployment scenarios discussion it is valid to
consider their potential dependencies from the existing incumbent users
and spectrum environment in general. Therefore, for each of the
potential deployment scenarios, it is essential to also consider
information on the (regional) incumbent/neighbour systems information.

Below, brief description of the considered 7 -24 GHz deployment
scenarios is captured. It should be noted, that none of the below listed
deployment scenarios is considered to be 7 -- 24 GHz range specific.

### 5.6.1 Indoor hotspot

Indoor hotspot scenario addresses an indoor case with relatively small
coverage, high capacity and high user throughput driven by high density
of low-mobility users. For the NR study, the carrier frequencies of 4
GHz, 30 GHz and 70 GHz were considered. Therefore, the whole 7 -- 24 GHz
range (with all three frequency sub-ranges being applicable) is seen as
suitable for indoor hotspot scenario. Indoor hotspot scenario is
expected to be addressed by the LA BS class.

### 5.6.2 Dense urban

Dense Urban scenario addresses outdoor and outdoor-to-indoor case in
dense urban, interference-limited scenarios, based on macro grid
coverage with continuous cellular layout, extended with randomly dropped
micro sites, i.e. two-layer layout (i.e. macro + micro). This scenario
is characterized by high user density of low and medium mobility, and
high traffic loads. For the NR study, the carrier frequencies of 4 GHz
and 30 GHz were considered.

This scenario is expected to be addressed by the WA and MR BS classes.
This scenario is well suited for CA or DC application.

### 5.6.3 Urban macro

Urban macro scenario addresses an outdoor and indoor case with large
cells and continuous coverage, serving users of low and medium mobility.

For the NR study, the carrier frequencies of 2 GHz, 4 GHz and 30 GHz
were considered. Therefore, the whole 7 -- 24 GHz range (with all three
sub-ranges being applicable) is seen as suitable for urban macro
scenario.

The difference to Dense urban scenario is that the Urban macro is a one
layer macro layout.

Urban macro scenario is expected to be addressed by the WA BS class. It
shall be noted, that WA BS class was defined also for FR2 operation.

### 5.6.4 IAB

A diverse range of deployment scenarios can be envisioned for IAB,
including support for outdoor small cell deployments, or indoors. For
the IAB performance evaluation, scenarios addressing outdoor and
outdoor-to-indoor case in dense urban, or urban micro case were
considered, based on macro grid IAB-donor coverage with continuous
cellular layout, extended with randomly dropped micro sites as
IAB-nodes, i.e. two-layer layout (i.e. macro + micro). The IAB WID in
RP-193226 \[65\] also includes the multi-hop IAB network case, which can
be seen as interesting feature to achieve range extensions even at
higher frequency bands of the 7 -- 24 GHz range.

From the propagation point of view, consideration of 7 -- 24 GHz range
brings more challenging scenario due to higher (compared to FR1)
attenuation, with decreased cell range. On the other hand, provision of
the LOS backhaul link from the rooftop donor-IAB node shall alleviate
propagation challenge. Similar, for the multi-hop case of cascaded
IAB-nodes, with the inter-IAB backhauling links being LOS, does not seem
to be a bottleneck for the IAB deployments in 7 -- 24 GHz range. Similar
to Dense Urban scenario, the IAB scenario is characterized by high user
density of low and medium mobility, and high traffic loads. For the IAB
study, the carrier frequencies of 4 GHz and 30 GHz were considered for
the IAB-donor and IAB-node, respectively. The micro layer of the
IAB-nodes is considered as the capacity layer, where the IAB study
assumed 400 MHz channel bandwidth for IAB-nodes.

### 5.6.5 Summary

Table 5.6.5-1 below summarizes the NR deployment scenarios for the 7 --
24 GHz frequency range.

Referring to clause 4.4.2 on the WRC-19 conclusions, one can find the
information on the resolution COM6/18 for the IMT for fixed wireless
broadband in fixed services bands. This resolution refers the Fixed
Wireless Access (FWA) scenario, which can be considered as yet another
deployment scenario applicable to 7 -- 24 GHz frequency range.

Studies on relations and dependencies among the FWA, fixed wireless
broadband, and/or IAB scenarios are considered to be out of scope of
this study item, while all those cases are seen as applicable to 7 -- 24
GHz frequency range.

Other NR deployment scenarios such as high speed train, highway scenario
or urban grid for connected car were also considered during the 7 -- 24
GHz study item, but no further analyses were provided for those.

5.7 NR system parameters analysis for 7 -- 24 GHz range
-------------------------------------------------------

### 5.7.1 General 

In this section, analysis for NR system parameters and background
information on how to determine the system parameters selection is
captured. This analysis and information can be used as guidance on
whether FR1 and FR2 system parameters can be re-used or new system
parameters are defined for frequency sub-ranges within the 7 -- 24 GHz
range.

### 5.7.2 SCS

#### 5.7.2.1 General

SCS selection is done within RAN4 according to RAN1's candidate SCS
design. From the RAN4 perspective, the SCS is dependent on the phase
noise considerations and channel impairments, such as delay spread and
Doppler spread. For the mmWave range, phase noise in general is worse at
higher frequencies, therefore for the 7 -- 24 GHz range, phase noise
should be evaluated when selecting the SCS. The cyclic prefix must
accommodate the channel delay spread in which can be a function of
implementation and several frequency dependent factors, including path
loss and scattering. The impact of antenna arrays, such as increased
range and beam selectivity, may affect SCS selection. The SCS selection
should consider the effects of Doppler on demodulation performance and
tracking.

#### 5.7.2.2 SCS for SSB

The SCS options for the SSB are generally based on the SCS used for the
band and the specified channel bandwidths in that band. For FR1, a trend
is that 30 kHz SCS for the SSB tends to be used as the frequency of the
bands increases. In contrast, the 120 and 240 kHz SCS options for the
SSB are allowed for the FR2 bands.

The selection of the SCS of the SSB can occur once the SCS for the bands
in the 7 -- 24 GHz range and the channel bandwidths are determined.

#### 5.7.2.3 SCS for shared / control channels

The shared and control channels are scalable in SCS. However, the
reference signal considerations for those channels are dependent on
frequency range. For example, in FR2, a phase tracking reference signal
(PT-RS) is mandatory. In addition, the channel bandwidths for bands in
the 7 -- 24 GHz range can restrict the allowed SCS.

### 5.7.3 Channel bandwidth 

The maximum channel bandwidth is related to the RF considerations and
sampling rate which is a function of FFT size and SCS selection.
Additionally, depending on spectrum allocation restrictions and
operators' request, additional channel bandwidths may be considered.

From a UE perspective, a requirement to support a large number of
channel bandwidths could increase the UE design complexity and
conformance testing time.

### 5.7.4 Spectrum utilization 

Regarding spectrum utilization (SU) perspective, it depends on the Tx
emission mask defined for protecting the adjacent channel and Rx
blocking requirements. Due to a lack of regulatory requirements defined
for 7 -- 24 GHz so far, the SU decision needs to be deferred to the
future WI phase.

However, the filter length or implementation difficulty should be taken
into account from both Tx side and Rx side. As the filter length will
also have impacts on the EVM window length, if there are any changes on
the SU tables for 7 -- 24 GHz, then the EVM window requirement should be
revisited correspondingly.

### 5.7.5 Channel raster

There are no refarming bands in 7 -24 GHz range, therefore the SCS-based
channel raster could be adopted for better spectrum utilization,
especially considering the intra-band contiguous CA scenario. Regarding
the use of either 15 kHz, 30 kHz, 60 kHz or 120 kHz SCS-based raster for
the 7 -- 24 GHz range, it is dependent on the SCS selection.

### 5.7.6 Sync raster

The following basic principle for the sync raster design could be reused
also for 7 -- 24 GHz range:

sync raster ≤ BW~config~ + channel raster -- BW~SSB~

where BW~config~ accounts for the bandwidth of the operating band,
minimum bandwidth, and guardband, BW~SSB~ is the bandwidth of the SSB.

Once the minimum BW, channel raster and SCS for SSB are determined, the
sync raster for 7 -- 24 GHz range can be determined.

### 5.7.7 Channel spacing

For the channel spacing between adjacent carriers, a formula is used to
ensure nominal channel spacing between adjacent carriers is a multiple
of channel raster. Therefore values of 0, ±(1/3) channel raster are
considered on all possible cases. A similar spacing may be considered
for the 7 -- 24 GHz range.

### 5.7.8 Aggregated system bandwidth

Referring to the TR 38.913 \[2\] on the NR deployment scenarios, values
of the aggregated system bandwidth were linked to the example carrier
frequencies (i.e. 700 MHz, 4 GHz, 30 GHz, or 70 GHz):

-   For the example carrier frequency of 4 GHz the aggregated system
    bandwidth was considered to be ≤ 200 MHz.

-   For the example carrier frequency of 30 GHz the aggregated system
    bandwidth was considered to be ≤ 1 GHz.

Considering the above NR aggregated system bandwidth values as
approximation of the corner cases for the 7 -- 24 GHz range, conclusion
for 7 -- 24 GHz range was derived. The range of the the (upper bound of
the) aggregated system bandwidth for 7 -- 24 GHz range is considered to
be within 200 -- 1000 MHz range.

#### 5.7.8.1 Single carrier operation

Based on the comparison of NR operating bands and channel bandwidths
with the widths of 7 -- 24 GHz frequency ranges of interest, it was
observed that the set of Rel-16 NR channel bandwidths (i.e. 5 MHz being
the narrowest, and 400 MHz being the widest) shall be sufficient for
potential NR applications in 7 -- 24 GHz range. This is motivated by the
fact that the largest width of the 7 -- 24 GHz frequency range of
interest are significantly narrower compared to the largest width of
Rel-15 FR2 operating band. Therefore, if the set of NR channel
bandwidths is considered as sufficient for Rel-15 FR2 operating bands,
it is also considered as sufficient for the NR operating in 7 -- 24 GHz
range.

NOTE: The above does not preclude any additional NR channel bandwidth
requests in future, e.g. based on the operators request motivated by the
spectrum utilization optimisation.

#### 5.7.8.2 Carrier aggregation

As 7 -- 24 GHz range is considered to be a capacity booster due to its
propagation characteristics, a typical envisioned CA scenario is
expected to use component carriers from the 7 -- 24 GHz range as the
Secondary Serving Cells (while the Primary Serving Cells are expected to
be allocated in FR1 operating bands). Therefore, carrier aggregation
deployment is seen as suitable and applicable to 7 -- 24 GHz deployment
scenarios, considering both contiguous and non-contiguous spectrum
allocations.

Referring to the NR UE specification in TS 38.101-3 \[19\], the
inter-band CA between FR1 and FR2 was also considered in Rel‑15. Such NR
inter-band CA case is including at least one component carrier from FR1
operating band, and at least one component carrier from FR2 operating
band. Extending such CA arrangement with the 7 -- 24 GHz range, it can
be envisioned that the following inter-band CA combinations could be
further considered:

\- FR1 component carrier(s) plus 7 -- 24 GHz component carrier(s), or

\- 7 -- 24 GHz component carrier(s) plus FR2 component carrier(s), or
even

\- FR1 component carrier(s) plus 7 -- 24 GHz component carrier(s) plus
FR2 component carrier(s).

NOTE: the above is valid irrespective of the future conclusions on
potential FR1/FR2 range extension(s).

Referring to the UE RF feature list \[21\], UE capability 2-2 (i.e.
simultaneous reception or transmission with same or different
numerologies in CA) was defined. Considering potentially different set
of the supported numerologies among the considered bands in any of the
three options above, this UE RF capability will also be applicable for
the inter-band CA with the potential 7 -- 24 GHz range bands.

#### 5.7.8.3 Dual connectivity

Similar to the CA motivation being the capacity booster, the Dual
Connectivity deployment is seen as suitable and applicable to 7 -- 24
GHz deployment scenarios.

Referring to TS 38.101-3 \[19\], large amount of inter-band DC
configurations between FR1 and FR2 was already defined in Rel-15, as
listed below. It is expected, that 7 -- 24 GHz range will further extend
the list of inter-band DC configurations.

-   Inter-band EN-DC (E-UTRA/NR Dual Connectivity) including FR1 and

-   Inter-band NR-DC (New Radio Dual Connectivity) between FR1 and FR2,

NOTE: Referring to applicability of minimum requirements in TS 38.101-3
\[19\], NR UE that supports inter-band NR-DC between FR1 and FR2
configuration shall meet the requirements for corresponding CA
configuration, unless otherwise specified.

Referring to the UE RF feature list \[21\], UE capability 2-4 (i.e.
simultaneous reception and transmission for inter-band EN-DC (TDD-TDD or
TDD-FDD)) would also be applicable for the inter-band EN-DC combinations
including 7 -- 24 GHz range carriers.

6.1 NR UE architecture
----------------------

### 6.1.1 Mixed UE transceiver architecture

Transceiver architecture and technology selection contribute to the
overall system performance. Unlike the FR1 and FR2, the 7 -- 24 GHz
range presents unique challenges to the transceiver architecture that
covers the entire frequency range. Two types of architectures are
presented above. Homodyne architecture was transceiver architecture of
choice for frequency sub-range 1 while heterodyne architecture was
selected for frequency sub-range 3. The IF frequency of the heterodyne
radio can be selected in 7 - 10 GHz range such IF section of the
heterodyne radio in 10 -- 24 GHz range uses similar circuits as homodyne
7 -- 10 GHz radio as shown in figure 6.2-1. The 7 -- 24 GHz range may
requires both types to cover the entire frequency range. One possible
way is to apply the homodyne architecture for 7 to 10 GHz range while
using heterodyne architecture for 10 to 24 GHz range. Mixed transceiver
architecture maybe more appropriate for this frequency range since as an
integrated device, transceiver may contain both lower range 7 to 10 GHz
homodyne architecture portion as well as the IF transceiver for a higher
range. The transceiver would share much of the components for the RF/IF
section. Additionally, it may be suitable to extend the 7 to 10 GHz RF
transceiver to cover sub 6 GHz range as well. However, this may add
complexity and cost to the UE transceiver.

**Figure 6.1.1-1: 7 -- 24 GHz UE transceiver architecture example**

### 6.1.2 Frequency sub-range 1

The homodyne or direct conversion architecture is widely used in sub-6
GHz, although it has the drawback on the IQ-imbalance, DC offset and
degradation of transmitted signal resulting in degradation of EVM, the
major advantage of direct conversion architecture is that the image
problem is avoided because of the zero IF, and the requirement of a
single LO realization is fulfilled. Benefiting from the technology
improvement on PLL design, real time I/Q imbalance calibration and DC
eliminating technology, the direct conversion architecture becomes a
mainstream architecture utilized by UE. For 10 GHz, direct conversion
architecture is highly possible be used. For LO generating, one solution
is to use transceiver-localized frequency multipliers (xLO) to generate
the target LO frequency by the frequency divider. It may become the
bottleneck for 10 GHz choosing direct conversion.

### 6.1.3 Frequency sub-range 3

For 20 GHz, considering the increased phase noise and difficulties on
PLL design for localized implementation, the UE reference architecture
with IF conversion is highly adopted for frequency sub-range 3. The
heterodyne architecture has an advantage in the phase noise requirements
compared to homodyne architecture, since the phase noise is
logarithmically proportional to the LO frequency having two sources of
LO reduce the phase noise of the system. However, the PLL implementation
is also a problem for this frequency point if direct conversion
architecture is adopted.

6.2 NR UE requirements classification
-------------------------------------

NR UE RF requirement type is studied based on the frequency sub-ranges
specified in clause 5.2. The study starts from the feasibility of the
current RF technology and testability, e.g. antenna design, PA trends,
filter, IC process and RF connector for conduct test.

\- For the sub-range 1 (i.e. 7.125 -- f~boundary,\ low~; where
f~boundary,\ low~ is within the frequency range 10 - 13 GHz, as in table
5.2-1), conducted RF requirements (FR1-like) is expected to be defined
considering the antenna size and PA performance shown in clause 5.4.1.

\- For the sub-range 2 (i.e. f~boundary,\ low~ - f~boundary,\ high~;
where f~boundary,\ low~ is within the frequency range 10 - 13 GHz and
f~boundary,\ high~ is within the frequency range 16 - 18 GHz, , as in
table 5.2-1), PAs could have the considerable performance as for the
frequency sub-range 1 with advanced IC process, and there is limited
space for UE to place more antenna elements. Depending on the frequency
boundaries of the frequency sub-range 2, more flexibility is envisioned:

\- If frequency sub-range 2 reaches to 16 GHz, the conducted RF
requirements (FR1-like) can be considered,

\- If frequency sub-range 2 reaches up to 18 GHz, the radiated RF
requirements (FR2-like) can be considered,

\- Some combination of both approaches is not precluded.

\- For the sub-range 3 (i.e. f~boundary,\ high~ -- 24.25 GHz; where
f~boundary,\ high~ is within the frequency range 16 - 18 GHz, , as in
table 5.2-1), the PA performance (i.e. Psat and PAE) has reduced much
compared with Pas operating below 18 GHz. Beam forming which can provide
high directional gain on EIRP could be considered. The other
ramification for the sub-range 3 is whether conducted RF requirement can
be applied for this range. Since it is provided with the acceptable RF
connector parameter operating at 26 GHz, the testability issue can be
resolved. For antenna integration, Antenna-in-Package (AiP) has become
an attractive technology for mmWave designs. This antenna integration
technology is part of a System-in-Package (SiP), where the antenna and
other components are designed and manufactured in separate substrates
that are then integrated into the full system's package. The benefit of
this integration type is that it enables separate optimization and
substrate selection for each component in the system. As it is not
possible to separate the antenna from the UE and consider relevant
transitions for this level of integration, OTA conformance testing is
required.

The NR UE requirements classification is summarized in figure 6.2-1.

6.3 UE RF requirements
----------------------

### 6.3.1 UE RF technology aspects

The RF requirements for NR UEs are broadly classified based on whether
the UE is tested in the conducted domain ("FR1 like") or OTA ("FR2
like"). With a mobile phone used as the typical UE example, some clear
criteria may be found to assess the "FR1 like" or "FR2 like" sub-ranges
within 7.125 -- 24.25 GHz regions. Nevertheless, other types of UE (CPE)
may also need to be considered and an exact frequency limit between "FR1
like" or "FR2 like" is harder to define.

From UE point of view, RF system design must balance several
considerations such as antenna size and polarization, semiconductor NF
and phase noise associated, gain and linearity.

#### 6.3.1.1 Antenna technology

##### 6.3.1.1.1 Beamforming

Figure below shows the equivalent antenna array size in free space
conditions what has been used in earlier co-existence studies and
referred among others in \[2\]. From this Figure we can see that the
antenna module doubles in size going from 28 GHz to 20 GHz and further
doubles at 14 GHz. Some handhelds are bigger today so it is hard to set
an absolute limit for the size and new antenna implementations may also
surface. At the same time, pathloss halves from 28 to 20 and further
halves when moving from 20 to 14 GHz.

![](media/image28.png)

**Figure 6.3.1.1.1-1: FR2 type antenna size (free space) vs. operating
frequency**

Another example that also takes the antenna substrate into account is
shown below. Taking the microstrip patch array design as an example, the
patch width and ground plane extension can be calculated based on a
common Rogers substrate: the element dimensions and array length
(assuming 4 elements with half-wavelength spacing) can be calculated, as
shown in figure 6.3.1.1.1-2.

![](media/image29.png){width="4.103895450568679in"
height="3.1955129046369204in"}

**Figure 6.3.1.1.1-2: Patch array dimensions vs. frequency**

Antenna size increases at lower frequencies it scales down at higher
frequencies and around 20 GHz the AIP technology is getting feasible and
similar RF architecture as used in FR2 could be used. However, the
antenna size at the highest frequencies of 7 -- 24 GHz range is still
larger than antennas of Rel-15 28 GHz solutions.

It is important to note that for frequencies close to 24 GHz the antenna
array dimensions are similar to the FR2 (24.25 -- 52.6 GHz) array
dimensions: especially if the UE is a multi-band design which co-locates
28 GHz and 39 GHz antenna arrays in the same volume. Thus, in a handheld
UE supporting both FR2 and 7 -- 24 GHz, an antenna array for the upper
frequencies in the 7 -- 24 GHz range competes for physical space in a
handset with an FR2 antenna array, and it is not likely that UE FR2
coverage performance can be traded off to support beamforming arrays in
the 7 -- 24 GHz frequency range. As the wavelength increases with
decreasing frequency, the antenna array size becomes prohibitively
large, with the array at 7 GHz approaching a significant percentage of
the entire length of a handset. Thus, from the perspective of potential
array size, a radiated requirement with an antenna beamforming
assumption may be challenging in handset form factor.

Smaller antenna arrays, e.g. 2×1, or individual antenna element could be
used. However, taking the complexity of beam management into account,
the benefit from using a beam steering antenna system with such a small
number of elements need to be understood.

UEs that have possibilities to deploy larger antennas like CPE or cars
can possibly utilize technologies that are not feasible for handheld
devices in this 7 -- 24 GHz frequency range.

##### 6.3.1.1.2 MIMO

Using spatial multiplexing or MIMO antennas offers higher flexibility in
terms of antenna design than antenna arrays, since it does not require
specific antenna radiation pattern, polarization or inter-element
distance. Such flexibility also eases the multi-band antenna design.
However, the performance of spatial multiplexing is limited by the
channel property, which requires that the channel can offer a high
number of ranks. In order to the investigate the possibility of using
spatial multiplexing/MIMO antenna system on the UE at a medium frequency
in 7 -- 24 GHz band, a measurement campaign, as described below was
carried out at 15 GHz.

The measurement was carried out in an indoor studio hall, where multiple
objects with different materials exist (see figure below). Two transmit
points (TPs) are mounted on the internal wall of the hall, and the UE is
moved along a closed route within the hall, as shown in figure
6.3.1.1.2-2. Two UEs with smart-phone form factor and a reference UE are
measured in this campaign, where each of them has four antenna ports.
The two UEs with smart-phone form factor are identical, and are placed
vertically and horizontally, respectively. Each UE is equipped with 4
single polarized antenna elements which point to four different
directions, as shown in figure 6.3.1.1.2-1. The UE with smart-phone form
factor is placed both vertically and horizontally during the
measurement. The reference UE has omni-coverage with dual-polarization
on the horizontal plane. Each TP has two beams with dual polarizations
for each of them.

height="2.0319444444444446in"}

Figure 6.3.1.1.2-1: The measurement environment in the hall space and
the illustration of the UE antenna radiation patterns at 15 GHz

The measured channel rank is shown in figure 6.3.1.1.2-2. It can be
observed that for such an environment, regardless of the UE antenna
configuration, the rank of the channel is larger than 1 in most of the
time, and in more than 60% of the time the rank of the channel reaches 3
or higher. This measurement result shows that the possibility that
spatial multiplexing through UE pattern diversity is valid, at least for
15 GHz band. Optimization of antenna design on both UE and TP side may
also further increase the rank of the channel.

distribution

#### 6.3.1.2 Propagation aspect for UE

##### 6.3.1.2.1 Indoor propagation at 15 GHz

In addition to the antenna configuration, the deployment scenario of
mobile networks is limited by the propagation channel as well. From the
same measurement as described above, we can also capture some insight on
how to deploy a cellular network at 15 GHz. The RSRP at the reference UE
antennas is also shown in figure 6.3.1.2.1-1. It can be observed that
when the UE moves to the NLOS region, the RSRP drops about 30 -- 40 dB.

![](media/image32.png){width="6.695138888888889in"
height="2.4763888888888888in"}

Figure 6.3.1.2.1-1: The measured RSRP of the reference UE over the
measurement route in the hall

The user body shadowing effect is also critical. Therefore, we have also
measured the shadowing loss due to the user body blockage at 15 GHz.
Measurements were performed in an anechoic chamber, where a real user
was holding a UE in data mode portrait position. The measured far field
radiation pattern of antenna 2 in the UE is shown in figure 6.3.1.2.1-2.
A clear user body shadowing region can be observed, and a loss due to
the user body blockage around 20 -- 25 dB can be observed in this
measurement.

This significant diffraction and shadowing losses due to the objects and
user body will limit the deployment scenario of cellular networks at 15
GHz.

radiation pattern with and without the user

##### 6.3.1.2.2 Outdoor propagation at 15 GHz

For outdoor scenario, buildings can imply a much more dramatic blockage
loss compared to the user body, and thus limit the coverage of the cell.
An outdoor measurement at 15 GHz is carried out in Kista, Stockholm,
Sweden, which is an urban environment with multiple office buildings.
The outdoor coverage is measured with a test system which consists of
two transmit points (TPs) and one mobile terminal. The mobile terminal
antenna, installed on top of a van at a height of 2.9 m (see Fig.
6.3.1.2.2-1), has roughly omni-directional coverage in horizontal plane.
The two TPs are installed on the walls of two office buildings as shown
in Fig. 6.3.1.2.2-1, at a height of 8.5 m (TP1) and 12 m (TP2), with an
inter-TP distance of 82 m. Each TP has an antenna with a maximum gain of
15 dBi, azimuth half power beam width (HPBW) of 90º, and elevation HPBW
of 8.6º. The detail of the measurement and more results can be found in
\[47\].

and TPs' location \[47\]

Fig. 6.3.1.2.2-2 shows the received signal strength for each TP over
streets and a scanned square. As indicated by the yellow arrows, the
coverage within LOS is quite good where the signal strength is above -65
dBm. However, the coverage is limited in NLOS conditions where the
signal strength quickly decreases towards the noise floor of the test
system, i.e. -75 dBm.

The same scenario as described above has been modelled in order to carry
out a 3D ray-tracing simulation including antenna designs in a
smartphone form factor UE device at both 15 GHz and 28 GHz. The
radiation pattern of the UE antennas used in the ray-tracing simulations
comes from the measurements of real mockups. The ray-tracing simulation
setup is shown in Fig. 6.3.1.2.2.-3. The ray-tracing simulation has been
verified with measurements as reported in \[48\]. The UE antenna
configuration at 15 GHz is the same as presented in as in Fig.
6.3.1.1.2-1, but antenna 3 is not used in here. The 28 GHz antenna
designs are the same, but scaled up to higher frequency. The device is
placed vertically without rotation during the simulation. The
ray-tracing simulations can offer a better dynamic range than the
measurements and therefore better can indicate feasible deployment
scenarios.

Figure 6.3.1.2.4-4: The coverage overview with three different antenna
design in a mobile device at (a) 15 GHz and (b) 28 GHz \[48\]

The simulated coverages with UE antenna 1, 2, 4 at both 15 GHz and 28
GHz are shown in Fig. 6.3.1.2.4-4, where, in this case, the base station
antenna is simplified as an omni-directional antenna located at the same
position as the TP1 above. Comparing 15 GHz to 28 GHz, it can be
observed that the smaller free space path loss at 15 GHz (5 dB) gives a
better coverage in the LOS and the LOS-NLOS transition regions.

In this ray-tracing simulation, there is neither roughness of the
building surface nor random scatters included. Therefore, the number of
multiple components in the channel is likely to be underestimated. Even
so, it was observed that there is a difference between the three antenna
ports in the UE, especially in the LOS-NLOS transition region. This
means there is a large potential for utilizing spatial diversity gain in
the UE to increase the cell coverage. In addition, for a rich scattering
environment (which is likely to be the case in dense urban micro), the
number of multiple components may still be high, which offers the
possibility to use spatial multiplexing to increase the data rate.

#### 6.3.1.3 RF front end technology

Current RF front-end technology used for \> 3.3 GHz TDD bands and Wi-Fi
can be extended at least up to 12 GHz.

GaAs or Si based power amplifier technologies used in FR1 for NR and
Wi-Fi can support up to 1W peak power at reasonable gain thus enabling
reasonable peak currents. Still, some antenna gain via UL MIMO would be
preferable as it would lower the total power and higher EIRP are
achieved.

Technology used for LNA and switches are already suitable for both FR1
and FR2 with only more aggressive lithography used at higher
frequencies, these can naturally support any approach within the 7.125
-- 24.25 GHz range. Below 12 GHz it is feasible that a switch supporting
branches for FR1 frequencies would support one branch up to 12 GHz.

##### 6.3.1.3.1 Active technologies

SOI CMOS is currently the work horse for the switch and LNA RFFE
functions in FR1 for both cellular and Wi-Fi systems. Especially since
it associates good noise figure/Gain and good switch losses/isolation on
the same die for the main antenna Tx/Rx modules and also for the
diversity and MIMO antennas Rx modules. It should be noted that SOI CMOS
is also used for PA / SWT / LNA / phase shifter functions in FR2 with
superior performance compared to bulk CMOS. So the coverage of the LNA
and switch functions in the 7.125 -- 24.25 GHz range is only a matter of
picking the right node.

In order to illustrate the options that can be picked from, table
6.3.1.3.1-1 recapitulates the key figures of merit for LNA and switches
versus nodes in SOI CMOS:

\- F~max~ in GHz provides a measure of the achievable power gain which
is essential in LNA and PA designs. A ratio of 5 (and preferably \> 10)
between F~max~ and the frequency of operation is desirable.

\- R~ON~ \* C~off~ in fs is key for switch performance as R~ON~ dictates
the losses in ON state and C~off~ the isolation in off state, the lower
the value, the better and the higher frequency of operation can be
targeted.

\- Transistor voltage is important to gage the output power capability
for PAs and power handling for switches. In general, the voltage
capability reduces with higher F~max~ which is consistent with lower
output power capability at higher frequencies of operation.

\- Gain and N~fmin~ at 5 GHz is regularly used as our benchmark for LNA
design, with typical values shown in the table not accounting for
variation in PVT.

NOTE: N~fmin~ above does not take to account the whole receiver chain
including all possible losses and needed trade-offs.

SiGe BiCMOS technology has also been used for Wi-Fi RF front-end in 5
GHz band especially because it has enabled compact single band TDD PA /
switch / LNA Tx/Rx modules. The Bipolar device has a better output power
capability than CMOS due to higher voltage (\>9 V) handling for Pas
(\>24 dBm) while the bulk CMOS device provides reasonable switches. LNAs
can be implemented in either HBT or CMOS depending on the linearity and
NF trade-off. LNA implemented in HBT has demonstrated NF similar to RF
SOI technology. This technology has also been widely used as a cellular
RFFE technology in FR1 and FR2. In FR2 it has capability to
monolithically integrate TDD PA / switch / LNA / phase shifter / VGA in
HBT with 'light' digital functions like control interface, memory, DFX,
etc. in CMOS.

Similar to SOI CMOS, table 6.3.1.3.1-2 illustrates the key figure of
merit for BiCMOS technologies for different nodes:

\- F~max~ \* BVCEO provides a measure of power capability and gain for
PA designs. It is a combination of the two first parameters of the SOI
CMOS table.

\- R~ON~ \* C~off~ in fs is key for switch performance as RON dictates
the losses in ON state and C~off~ the isolation in off state, the lower
the value, the better and the higher frequency of operation can be
targeted.

\- Gain and N~fmin~ at 5 GHz is regularly used as our benchmark for LNA
design, with typical values shown in the table not accounting for
variation in PVT.

\- State-of-the-art low noise transistors in SiGe HBT technology have
nominal minimum NF values of 0.25 dB, 0.55 dB, 0.8 dB and 1.1 dB at 10
GHz, 20 GHz, 30 GHz and 40 GHz, respectively.

NOTE: N~fmin~ above does not take to account the whole receiver chain
including all possible losses and needed trade-offs.

Here again, multiple choices are available and for the 7 -- 24 GHz range
and 180/130 nm nodes provides a good compromise for PA / switch / LNA
function till and including FR2 band. Above this frequency, if lower PA
power is acceptable, SOI CMOS offers a better overall compromise.

**When uncompromised performance in terms of output power, bandwidth and
efficiency is needed, III-V GaAs pHEMT Pas, and at FR1 frequencies, GaAs
HBTs are dominating in RF front-end modules. For low voltage (3 - 5 V)
applications, GaAs HBT perform well up to \>15 GHz and unless much
higher voltage is available (12 V), GaAs HBT is on par with GaN which
targets higher power applications like small cells or infrastructure.**

One way to compare the different technologies is to look into achievable
average output power performance for Wi-Fi OFDM at 6 GHz and extrapolate
to 12 GHz. The linearity level we would design for is -30 dB EVM which
is quite comparable to 30 dBc ACLR linearity level for NR with CP-OFDM:

\- Bulk CMOS: 16 dBm (3.3 V) \[\@xx% peak PAE\]

\- SiGe BiCMOS: 24 dBm (3.3-5 V) @ \[37.5% peak PAE\]

\- SOI CMOS: 20 dBm (3.3 V) \[\@xx% peak PAE\]

\- GaAs HBT: 26 dBm (3.3 -- 5 V) \[\@xx% peak PAE\]

\- GaN HEMT: 33 dBm (12 V), similar to GaAs HBT at 5 V \[\@xx% peak
PAE\]

\- For DFT-s-OFDM QPSK output power capability is about 2 dB higher

III-V based Pas have at 10% higher efficiency and \>6 dB higher power
capability, when compared to CMOS, which is essential for battery power
especially for applications with significant post-PA losses such as FR1
UE supporting large number of bands and band combinations.

There is reported evidence that III-V based Pas can be designed
inherently broadband whilst preserving good efficiency, linearity and
output power which will thus address a wide range of perceivable band
combinations without needing too many separate PA devices. ACLR could be
better than -35 dB at +26 dBm. The channel bandwidth of III-V based PA
can be beyond 500 MHz while the frequency coverage can be made larger
than 40%.

SiGe HBT of BiCMOS has high Ft and F~max~ compared to GaAs HBT. In FR1
band, PA in this technology has demonstrated performance comparable to
that in GaAs HBT between 3 and 7 GHz. SiGe HBT Pas have high gain and
wideband response because of high Ft/F~max~. Optimization in doping
profile has enabled variants with higher breakdown voltage. In FR1 band
SiGe HBT technology based PA have similar PAE as GaAs HBT for cellular
and WiFi applications. At higher frequency, e.g. 12 GHz, no significant
degradation is expected from active device because operating frequency
is significantly lower than Ft/F~max~. However, some degradation is
expected from back-end technology due to higher substrate losses at
higher frequency. Minimum NF of LNA in this technology lies between 0.25
dB and 0.65 dB in 7 -- 24 GHz range and a 2-stage LNA can produce small
signal gain in excess of 25 dB. TDD switch in RF SOI is better than that
in SiGe BiCMOS. At 12 GHz output power capability may be reduced by 1 dB
but for technologies where power gain is reduced, the Power Added
Efficiency (PAE) would suffer as it accounts for the power delivered at
the input of the PA stages. If high power capability (\>23 dBm) at 12
GHz is needed, GaAs and SiGe BiCMOS are the preferred choice to control
the battery current to reasonable levels. At lower power levels, and
when further integration on the die is needed both SOI CMOS and SiGe
BiCMOS offer good performance/integration trade‑off.

III-V pHEMT based LNAs can achieve a NF below 2 dB within the 7 -- 24
GHz frequency range, while the gain of a two stage LNA can be above 20
dB.

##### 6.3.1.3.2 Passive technologies

LC filters using printed elements in a module or a passive substrate
should also be feasible up to 12 GHz but would require special attention
of the ground design. High Q filtering is limited but diplexing and
harmonic rejection function should be feasible.

Technologies used in FR2 are obviously able to support the 7.125 --
24.25 GHz frequency range but at lower frequencies, integrating matching
networks and phase shifters has a significant impact on size and using
more advanced technologies, it may impact the cost negatively.

Although BAW filters are discussed above 10 GHz in literature, above 8
GHz maintaining high Qs will be difficult as thinner acoustic layer (AlN
has a speed of \~10 km/s) or development of new material or modes would
be needed. With current technologies the piezo + electrodes stack
thickness should be smaller than 1um at 10 GHz. Thus, similar to the
frequencies above 3.3 GHz in FR1, filter performance should be relaxed
compared to those used in FDD bands to be essentially feasible with LC
filter, while BAW can still be used to provide notches at some
particular frequencies.

Miniature ceramic dielectric filters or MEM cavity-based filters can
operate in the 7 -- 24 GHz range but are usually too bulky for a
smartphone.

Above 7 GHz, the use of discrete passive components like inductors and
capacitors SMTs isn't an option for RF matching and decoupling due to
self-resonance issues. It can still be used for lower frequency like DC
supply decoupling, but it needs to rely on integrated passives
technologies like LTCC or IPD for critical RF passive functions.

Integrated Passive Device (IPD) LC designs are widely used in FR1 to
integrate critical harmonic filters or PA matching. IPD works reasonably
well up to 12 GHz provided capacitor Qs are improved, which is feasible
by adapting the MIM (Metal Insulator Metal) capacitor dielectric
thickness and/or material. Figure illustrates an IPD LC filter design at
6-7 GHz providing 40 dB rejection for cellular bands up to 5 GHz. It is
also to be noted that transmission line designs can also be realized on
IPD which allows designs above 12 GHz, furthermore some of these design
techniques are also applicable on the active dies but with lower Q.

Figure 6.3.1.3.2-1: Simulation of an IPD filter operating at 7 GHz

As an example on the other filter technology simulated S21 of the LTCC
filter is shown in figure below. The insertion loss is less than 2.5 dB
for 2 GHz wide bandwidth and also the stop band attenuations are better
than -20 dB at relative offset of \~5% (0.5 GHz) from the pass band
edge. The level of stop-band attenuation is still far from duplex-filter
performance, but it should be noted that the relative bandwidth of the
designed filter is also several times wider than band-width of the
current duplex filters, which is usually no more than 4%
(100Meg/2.5GHz). The achieved attenuations are sufficient for providing
protection for adjacent frequency bands and for protecting own receiver
from interference from these bands. The results shown are based on the
simulations and are not fully taking into account the manufacturing
tolerances and ambient conditions.

For the 7 -- 24 GHz range, single-pole double-throw (SPDT) switches are
expected to be used in many occasions of systems. Currently, the III-V
based switch component can achieve reported insertion loss figures of
around 1 dB at 30 GHz in FR2. Therefore, an even better performance can
be obtained in lower frequencies. Insertion loss below 0.8 dB with
isolation larger than 20 dB can be achieved by III-V based SPDT switch
within the 7 -- 24 GHz frequency range.

#### 6.3.1.4 Testability considerations

FR2 UE requirements carry with them an additional layer of complexity
associated with beam management procedures both for the network and the
UE, and additionally antenna array RF architecture for the UE. This
complexity provides a motivation to determine whether conducted UE RF
requirements over the entire frequency range of 7.125 to 24.25 GHz are
feasible.

A reasonable starting point for this analysis is in the form of a
connector and probe capability study, as shown in table 6.3.1.4-1.

When evaluating the connector from Supplier D, it was possible to verify
experimentally that the connector's use up to 15 GHz (i.e. 3 GHz above
the spec sheet) is feasible. Evaluations of connectors from Supplier E
and Supplier G have revealed that the full range of the frequencies in
this study item's scope is supported; however, the connector dimensions
pose a mechanical challenge to their integration into a handset form
factor. In this aspect, an outlook on future capabilities in terms of
connector dimensions is needed rather than a survey of currently
available dimensions.

Market need tends to identify innovation trends, and it is feasible that
a convergence of an actual band plan, deployment scenario, and real
market need can promote the industry to further innovate the connector
technology to enable integration into a handset form factor.

Radiated measurements are needed if beamforming is needed to meet the
system performance requirements or conducted measurements are otherwise
insufficient to verify the system performance.

For frequency larger than 20 GHz, the AIP technology has become a
mainstream choice for RFIC and antenna capsule. It implements antennas
with dies. It can improve the mmW signal integrity and help forming an
array of antenna elements to get more directional gain. Since antennas
cannot be removed from the package, testing has to be considered with
OTA measurements. This is the reason NR FR2 only define the OTA RF
requirements.

7 NR BS 
=======

7.1 General
-----------

For the purposes of this SI, the RF technology analyses of the NR BS
operation in 7 -- 24 GHz frequency range are limited to the single-band
operation, only.

7.2 BS architecture and requirements classification
---------------------------------------------------

### 7.2.1 Reference architecture

For NR BS two different architectures have been defined. The
architectures different with respect to defined requirement anchor
points and requirement applicability. A base station can into three main
components:

\- Transceiver Unit Array (TRXUA)

\- RF Distribution Network (RDN)

\- Antenna Array (AA)

In figure 7.2.1-1, the architecture for requirement set category H is
visualized, where requirements are defined at TAB and RIB.

![](media/image49.emf){width="4.170247156605424in" height="2.875in"}

Figure 7.2.1-1: BS architecture relevant for requirement set category H

In figure 7.2.1-2, the architecture for requirement set category O is
visualized, where all requirements are defined as OTA requirements at
RIB.

![](media/image50.emf){width="3.1875in" height="2.7567563429571305in"}

Figure 7.2.1-2: BS architecture relevant for requirement set category O

The Release 15 NR basestation specifications include 3 types of
basestation:

\- The conducted basestation (*BS type 1-C*) type refers to a non-AAS BS
architecture. The basestation does not include an antenna. The antenna
is built separately and is likely to correspond to a passive sector
antenna for a macro basestation. For micro and indoor basestations the
antenna may have a wider coverage angle. All RAN4 requirements for
conducted basestations are specified at each individual antenna
connector. *BS type 1-C* is applicable to FR1 only.

\- The hybrid basestation type (*BS type 1-H*) is an AAS basestation
that has connectors or other means for conducted testing of individual
transceivers. An AAS basestation has an integrated antenna. *BS type
1-H* basestations comply with two far field OTA requirements as well as
conducted requirements. Unlike *BS type 1-C*, some conducted
requirements are specified as a sum across multiple connectors. *BS type
1-H* is applicable for FR1 only.

\- The OTA basestation is an AAS basestation type (*BS type 1-O* for
FR1, *BS type 2-O* for FR2) that has only a radiated interface. All
requirements are specified OTA, as either directional, TRP or
co-location type requirements. The OTA BS type is applicable for both
release 15 frequency ranges.

### 7.2.2 Requirement sets

The NR RF core specification defines multiple requirement sets. The
requirement set support is different for FR1 and FR2. In table 7.2.2-1,
the requirement set defined in NR are listed. Together, the requirement
set category and frequency range defines the NR BS type.

+----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+

It is clear that x~FR~-O requirements will be needed for the 7 -- 24 GHz
frequency range. Type x~FR~-C BS (or non-AAS) will clearly be limited by
lower antenna gain (compared to the beam forming architectures) and the
larger path loss in this frequency range will result in smaller cell
sizes than for FR1. However, at this stage, x~FR~-C and x~FR~-H
requirements cannot be ruled out for BS operating within frequency
sub-range 1 and sub-range 2.

Comparing the x~FR~-H and x~FR~-O AAS BS types, the principle
differences from a testing perspective are that for 1-H, there is no
need for out of band OTA testing facilities or for TRP testing. TRP
emissions and conducted emissions limits could be set to be the same. In
addition to this, most other TX requirements (i.e. signal quality and
power dynamics) have the same value whether tested conducted or OTA.

*For the receiver, for FR1 a method to relate conducted and radiated
requirements has been established. For FR2, there is no such methodology
as there are no conducted requirements. For the 7 -- 24 GHz range,
depending on the frequency and the expected receiver types, the FR1
approach may be applicable, or further work may be needed to develop a
new approach or in the worst case, no mapping between radiated and
conducted requirements may be possible. (In the latter case, it may of
course be possible to derive conducted and radiated requirements without
relating them). Depending on the applicable new band, if introducing
both conducted and radiated requirements a future WI may need to take
such factors into account.*

*Demodulation requirements for up to 2RX map directly between conducted
and OTA. OTA testing of \>2RX demodulation requirements is not feasible
for FR1 or FR2 and will not be feasible in 7 -- 24 GHz range. An
assessment of the link budget in applicable test chambers for the
frequency in question is needed to ensure OTA testability feasibility of
demodulation requirements at sufficiently high SINR at the BS receiver.
BS demodulation requirements that are not OTA tested may still be
specified as conducted only. Within these constraints, demodulation
requirements are possibly for any BS type in 7 -- 24 GHz range.
Therefore, discussion of further details of the BS demodulation testing
in 7 -- 24 GHz range is deferred to the related future WI.*

### 7.2.3 Antenna topologies

The antenna array (AA) consists of *M* x *N* x 2 antenna elements (AE)
placed is a certain lattice, arranged in *M* rows and *N* columns of
cross-polarized elements. The signals from the AA are mapped in the RDN
creating different antenna topologies, as presented on examples in
figure 7.2.3-1. The RDN mapping is creating sub-arrays, where the
radiating characteristics of a sub-array is different to single antenna
elements.

Figure 7.2.3-1: Example RDN mappings

Depending on intended coverage scenarios different types of RDN mappings
are foreseen for the frequency range 7 -- 24 GHz. For *BS type x~FR~-H*
and *BS type x~FR~-O*, the OTA RF characteristics defined for
requirement set category H and requirement set category O is declared by
the base station manufacturer in terms of full array capability as well
as sub‑array or element capability, see TS 38.141-2 \[6\], clause 4.6.

### 7.2.4 Array antenna model

In Table 7.2.4-1, the parameters used by the parameterized array antenna
model are described. Based on AAS base station architecture in clause
7.2.1 (i.e. the BS type x~FR~-H and BS type x~FR~-O) and deployment
scenarios envisioned for the 7 -- 24 GHz range, different parameter sets
are required to model an AAS base station.

where the element factor, array factor and linear phase progressing is
characterized as described by equations in Table 7.2.4-2.

+----------------------------+----------------------------+----------+

To conserve complexity the model is created so that the element is gain
normalized, instead of the composite array pattern. As a consequence,
parameters cannot be selected arbitrarily, since parameters are
dependent on each other. The intension with the model is to model
absolute gain patterns correctly without full pattern directivity
normalization. To model absolute gain, parameters must be selected
carefully, if not the model produces nonphysical and incorrect gain
response.

When array antenna parameters are selected for the array antenna model
it is preferable to consider physical aspects such as the gain/area
relation and gain/beamwidth relations by checking following aspects in
given order:

1\. The considered deployment scenario and coexistence situation will
give the appropriate coverage range requirement for the horizontal and
vertical domain.

NOTE 1: For analysis of the NR deployment scenarios considered for the 7
-- 24 GHz range, refer to clause 5.6.

2\. From the coverage ranges and deployment scenario the required
antenna gain can be determined, from which the array antenna geometry
can be determined in terms of number of rows (*M*), the number of
columns (*N*).

3\. From the coverage ranges the array antenna steering capability can
be determined in terms element separations (*d~v~*, *d~h~*).

NOTE 2: The element separations *d~v~* and *d~h~* is the distance
between radiating elements in the array antenna. The RDN can be used to
create sub-arrays to optimize coverage. When sub-arrays are modelled,
parameters can be selected to model the sub-array as a radiating
element, in this case *d~v~* and *d~h~* is the distance between
sub-arrays in the antenna array.

4\. From the given array lattice the element parameters can be
considered with respect to the given area for a single element. The
element peak gain (*G~E,max~*) and half power beamwidth product
(*ϕ~3dB\ ~*and *θ~3dB~*) depend on each other and must be selected
together to maintain accurate model gain response. The element loss
(*L~E~*) needs to be included when the element peak gain is determined.
Select parameter values for beamwidth based on the following two
parameters checks:

a\. Check the peak element directivity (*D~E,max~*) with the unit area
available for a single element in the array lattice, as described in Eq.
7.2.4-1.

b\. Check the peak element directivity (*D~E,max~*) with the half-power
beam width product (*ϕ~3dB\ ~*and *θ~3dB~*), as described in Eq.
7.2.4-2.

5\. The model gain is guaranteed by an element peak directivity
normalization directivity (*D~E,max~*) described in Eq. 7.2.4-3. The
peak element gain *G~E,max~* is calculated based on Eq. 7.2.4-4.

The peak element directivity (assuming no losses for a given antenna
aperture area) can be expressed as:

$D_{E,max} \leq 10\log_{10}\left( \frac{4\pi d_{h}d_{v}}{\lambda^{2}} \right)$
(Eq. 7.2.4-1)

Also, the peak element directivity for a given wide symmetrical beam can
be approximated by:

$D_{E,max} \approx 10\log_{10}\left( \frac{K}{\varphi_{3\text{dB}}\theta_{3dB}} \right)$
(Eq. 7.2.4-2)

, where *K* is a factor that depends on the element properties. For
single elements with symmetrical large beamwidths, *K = 52525* is
appropriate, while for sub-arrays with narrower beamwidth
characteristics, *K = 32400* is more appropriate. Depending on the
element characteristics the relation between element peak gain and the
half power beam width product is different as described in \[65\].

*To be exact it is recommended to select element parameters, where the
peak element gain is determined by calculating the directivity from a
given geometry including beam widths.* The element directivity can be
calculated based on the pattern described by Table 7.2.4-1 in dBi as:

$D_{E,max} = 10\log_{10}\left( \frac{4\pi\left\lbrack A_{\text{lin}}\left( \theta,\varphi \right) \right\rbrack_{\max}}{\int_{- \pi}^{\pi}{\int_{0}^{\pi}{A_{\text{lin}}\left( \theta,\varphi \right)\sin\left( \theta \right)d\theta d\varphi}}} \right)$
(Eq. 7.2.4-3)

, where *A~lin~(θ,ϕ)* is defined in linear scale as:

$A_{\text{lin}}\left( \theta,\varphi \right) = 10^{\frac{A\left( \theta,\varphi \right)}{10}}$
(Eq. 7.2.4-4)

7.3 BS classes
--------------

The BS to UE minimum coupling loss of each NR BS class as defined in TS
38.104 \[5\] is the same as that of UTRAN in TS 25.104 \[60\] or E-UTRA
in TS 36.104 \[24\], while the BS to UE minimum distance of each NR BS
class is calculated using the path-loss formula in TR 25.951 \[61\]:

$$L = 38.25 + 20\log_{10}\left( d \right)$$

Which is derived from the free-space path-loss formula as in TR 25.942
\[22\]:

$$L = 20\log_{10}\left( \frac{4\pi df}{c} \right)$$

Where:

\- d is the BS to UE distance in meters,

\- c is the speed of light in m/s,

\- f is the carrier frequency in Hz.

For FR1 studies the carrier frequency was assumed to be 2 GHz. For FR2
it was decided to use the same definition of BS classes using the same
set of minimum distances and minimum coupling losses as for FR1.

The considered base station classes are Wide Area Base Stations, Medium
Range Base Stations and Local Area Base Stations. The associated
deployment scenarios (as discussed in clause 5.6) for each class are
exactly the same for BS with and without connectors.

For *BS type x~FR~-O*, BS classes are defined as indicated below:

\- Wide Area Base Stations are characterised by requirements derived
from Macro Cell scenarios with a BS to UE minimum distance along the
ground equal to 35 m.

\- Medium Range Base Stations are characterised by requirements derived
from Micro Cell scenarios with a BS to UE minimum distance along the
ground equal to 5 m.

\- Local Area Base Stations are characterised by requirements derived
from Pico Cell scenarios with a BS to UE minimum distance along the
ground equal to 2 m.

For *BS type x~FR~-C* and *BS type x~FR~-H*, BS classes are defined as
indicated below:

\- Wide Area Base Stations are characterised by requirements derived
from Macro Cell scenarios with a BS to UE minimum coupling loss equal to
70 dB.

\- Medium Range Base Stations are characterised by requirements derived
from Micro Cell scenarios with a BS to UE minimum coupling loss equals
to 53 dB.

\- Local Area Base Stations are characterised by requirements derived
from Pico Cell scenarios with a BS to UE minimum coupling loss equal to
45 dB.

Considering the 7 - 24 GHz frequency range is between FR1 and FR2 in the
frequency domain, it is logical to use the same set of minimum distances
and minimum coupling losses for the BS classes within the 7 - 24 GHz
frequency range.

#### 7.4.1.2 Output power accuracy

##### 7.4.1.2.1 General

There are currently 3 types of output power accuracy requirement which
applied depends on the BS type:

\- Base station output power

Conducted requirement applicable to *BS type 1-C* and *BS type 1-H*
normal and extreme conditions

\- Radiated transmit power

Directional OTA requirement (EIRP) applicable to *BS type 1-H* normal
conditions only and, *BS type 1-O* and *BS type 2-O* normal and extreme
conditions)

\- OTA base station output power

Total radiated power requirement (TRP) applicable to *BS type 1-O* and
*BS type 2-O* normal conditions only

In all cases the requirement is a power accuracy requirement in dB which
is applied to a declared power level.

The power accuracy requirements clearly have some interdependency, it
has been agreed that the following relationship exists between the
requirements

$${\text{conducted}\ \text{power}}_{\text{accuracy}} \leq \text{TRP}_{\text{accuracy}} \leq \ \text{EIRP}_{\text{accuracy}}$$

Also the requirements which apply to both FR1 and FR2 BS the accuracy
levels are different implying a frequency dependency, the correct
accuracy value for the 7 -- 24 GHz range is to be determined. The
following relationships can also be stated:

$$\text{EIRP}_{accuracy\_ FR1} \leq \text{EIRP}_{accuracy\_ 7to24GHz} \leq \ \text{EIRP}_{accuracy\_ FR2}$$

$$\text{TRP}_{accuracy\_ FR1} \leq \text{TRP}_{accuracy\_ 7to24GHz} \leq \ \text{TRP}_{accuracy\_ FR2}$$

And by implication:

$$P_{conducted\_ ccuracy\_ FR1} \leq P_{conducted\_ ccuracy\_ 7to24GHz}$$

When setting the power accuracy requirements both the impact on the
network performance and the practicality of implementation are
considered. The goal of setting an optimum output power variation
requirement therefore is to have a value which does not make
implementation to restrictive but offers enough control that networks
can be planned.

##### 7.4.1.2.2 Conducted output power accuracy

Conducted output power accuracy is applicable to FR1 BS with a conducted
interface. For FR1 AAS BS there is the assumption that BB beam forming
architectures are dominant and hence for both *BS type 1-C* and *BS type
1--H* each BB chain drives a single transmitter/PA path. In this case
the power accuracy is dependent primarily on the detector accuracy and
the variation after the detector.

For *BS type x~FR~-C*, the accuracy of these blocks should be examined
once the operating frequency bands are known.

For *BS type x~FR~-H* the picture is not so clear as an *BS type
x~FR~-H* may not be directly related to a *BS type x~FR~-C* in the same
way *BS type 1-H* and *BS type 1-C* systems are related in FR1;

\- If the *BS type x~FR~-H* is based on an equivalent *BS type x~FR~-C*
then the requirements will be the same as *BS type x~FR~-C* .

\- If the *BS type x~FR~-H* is derived from a *BS type x~FR~-O* system
then the conducted accuracy will need to be investigated in a different
manner.

However the *BS type x~FR~-H* figures are determined however we can
state:

$$2.0 \leq P_{conducted\_ ccuracy\_ 7to24GHz}$$

##### 7.4.1.2.3 TRP accuracy

TRP accuracy is the OTA equivalent of conducted power, however there are
some additional error factors which must be taken into account relating
to variation in loss of passive antenna elements, beam formers,
distribution networks etc.

For FR1 the additional errors were small (\< 0.5 dB) and hence the rms
addition of the conducted error and the additional errors resulted in
the same value as the conducted accuracy (±2.0 dB).

For FR2 there is no conducted output power requirement and hence the
accuracy value was derived directly. For FR2 there ae 2 major
considerations:

\- The higher frequency means component variation is greater

\- The predicted hybrid architecture makes power control for each PA
more difficult to implement.

The FR2 TRP accuracy was agreed to be ±3.0 dB.

Hence for 7 -- 24 GHz we can state:

$2.0 \leq \text{TRP}_{\text{accurac}y_{7to24GHz}} \leq \ 3.0$

It can be noted that the higher FR2 value is reliant not only on the
increased frequency but also the assumed architecture. In the 7 -- 24
GHz range it is expected that the optimum architecture for
implementation may change, as such there may be a step in the output
power accuracy requirement associated with this. This can be further
investigated when the operating bands are known.

##### 7.4.1.2.4 EIRP accuracy

The radiated EIRP accuracy was investigated using 3 techniques

Impact of accuracy on network performance

Existing non-AAS EIRP accuracy

Estimated achievable accuracy by an AAS BS

Companies were free to contribute based on any or all the methods,
however most chose to focus on the estimated achievable accuracy. Final
agreement on the accuracy of was by considering all contributions (not
just the error estimates) and agreeing an acceptable value by consensus.

For FR1 the agreed value was ±2.2 dB

For FR2 the agree value was ±3.4 dB

Hence we can state:

$2.2 \leq \text{EIRP}_{\text{accurac}y_{7to24GHz}} \leq \ 3.4$

For the 7 -- 24 GHz range EIRP accuracy analysis can be considered once
the operating bands are known.

#### 7.4.1.3 Output power dynamics

##### 7.4.1.3.1 Conducted RE power control dynamic range

For the conducted RE power control dynamic range in 7 -- 24 GHz range
the following consideration shall be taken into account:

For QPSK and 16QAM:

In case the conducted unwanted emission limits are not increased
(compared to the existing FR1 limits) for 7 -- 24 GHz sub-range, then
the conducted RE power up requirement can be reused for the applicable 7
-- 24 GHz sub-range. Otherwise, the conducted RE power control dynamic
range requirement might require to be re-visited during the WI phase.

In case the conducted EVM requirements are kept unchanged within 7 -- 24
GHz sub-range, the conducted RE power down range requirement can also be
reused for the same 7 -- 24 GHz sub-range. Otherwise, the conducted RE
power control dynamic range requirement might require to be re-visited
during the WI phase.

For 64QAM: no requirement for the 7 -- 24 GHz range is required.

For 256QAM (if decided to be applicable to the 7 -- 24 GHz sub-range):
no requirement for the 7 -- 24 GHz range is required.

##### 7.4.1.3.2 OTA RE power control dynamic range

For the OTA RE power control dynamic range in 7 -- 24 GHz range the
following consideration shall be taken into account:

Verification of the OTA output power dynamics is not impacted by the
spatial aspects around the DUT.

For FR1-like sub-range of the 7 -- 24 GHz range, the OTA RE power
control dynamic range requirement for QPSK and 16QAM is to be the same
as the conduced RE power control dynamic range requirement.

For FR2-like sub-range of the 7 -- 24 GHz range, there is no OTA RE
power control dynamic range requirement defined.

##### 7.4.1.3.3 Total power dynamic range

The total power dynamic range is defined as the difference between the
maximum (i.e. for full RB allocation) and the minimum (i.e. for single
RB allocation) transmit power of an OFDM symbol for a specified
reference condition.

Therefore, once the set of supported channel bandwidths and the set of
SCS is agreed for 7 -- 24 GHz sub-range supporting conducted
requirements, the derivation of the total power dynamic range
requirement will be straightforward.

##### 7.4.1.3.4 OTA total power dynamic range

Derivation of the OTA total power dynamic range in 7 -- 24 GHz range is
the same as for the conducted version of this requirement and is based
on the PRB count for the supported channel bandwidth and SCS. For the
frequency sub-range where both conducted and radiated requirements will
apply, the conduced and OTA total power dynamic range requirements are
the same.

#### 7.4.1.4 Transmit ON/OFF power

The TX OFF requirement is a TDD requirement used to protect receivers in
the same band from the off level emissions from a transmitter. The
requirement is in the assigned channel frequency.

For FR1 BS the level is set to protect co-sited BS, the conducted and
the OTA levels are set accordingly, so that a co-sited BS suffers \<1 dB
degradation of the receiver sensitivity.

For the FR1 conducted the requirement this is:

$$P_{\text{int}} = - 85dBm + 30 + 10*\log_{10}\left( 4.5 \right) = - 108.5dBm$$

$$P_{\text{sens}} = 10*\log_{10}\left( 10^{\frac{- 174 + 5 + 10*\log_{10}\left( 4.5MHz \right)}{10}} + 10^{\frac{- 108.5}{10}} \right) + 1 = - 100.5dBm$$

The FR1 OTA requirement is specified as an equivalent output from the
*co-location reference antenna*.

FR2 TX OFF requirements are set based on interference with BS is the
same geographical area at a distance of 100 m.

When looking at any operating band the co-location OFF level is lower
than the co-existence case, however for a BS which has both a
transmitter and a receiver it is clear that the most vulnerable receiver
is the BS's own receiver, as such if the Tx is in the OFF state when
performing the RX sensitivity test then conformance to TX OFF level is
demonstrated by this.

FR1 conducted specification are written separately for TX and Rx and it
is considered that there may be separate Tx and Rx connectors, as such
it is possible to test the Rx sensitivity without the Tx, as such a
separate TX OFF requirement is necessary. OTA systems cannot separate
the Tx and Rx in the same way so the TX OFF requirement becomes
redundant. For FR1 OTA requirements however as the goal was to provide
requirements which were equivalent to the conducted requirements and as
TX OFF measurement with the co-location methodology was possible the TX
OFF requirement was maintained as a co-location requirement.

For FR2 as the interface is OTA and there is no equivalence to legacy
conducted requirements it was sufficient to rely on the RX sensitivity
test to show TX OFF co-location compliance.

The co-existence TX OFF level whilst being a lower level also has
tighter timing requirements to account for the propagation time between
the BS and the victim. So whilst the receiver sensitivity test
guaranteed the OFF level assuming no propagation time it does not
guarantee the OFF level is reached quickly enough. As such the
co-existence OFF level is required in conjunction with the transient
requirement to protect non-co-located BS receivers.

The TX OFF requirements are hence covered as follows:

Table 7.4.1.4-1: Transmit ON/OFF power requirements

                 FR1                    FR2
  -------------- ---------------------- ----------------------
  co-location    Tx OFF and Transient   Rx sensitivity
  co-existence                          TX OFF and transient

For FR1 the 2 requirements are merged with the toughest timing
requirement and the toughest OFF level, this makes a simple requirement
but is perhaps over specified in terms of performance.

For the 7 -- 24 GHz range it can be considered that:

\- There are no existing conducted requirements, so there is no need to
maintain equivalence to anything

\- There will be defiantly have OTA requirement sets

\- It will be difficult to implement FR1 like co-location requirements

\- They may have conducted requirement (in lower bands)

Co-location in the 7 -- 24 GHz region has a number of implementation
issues which may require a new method of measuring co-location emissions
however if co-location and co-existence scenarios are separated as they
are with FR2 the TX OFF requirements will be simpler to implement.

For 7 -- 24 GHz systems with conducted only requirements where the TX
and Rx are separate it may be necessary to provide an additional
conducted Tx OFF requirement (or have an appropriately lower level).

For summary of the co-location requirements refer to clause 7.4.1.10.

#### 7.4.1.5 Transmitted signal quality

##### 7.4.1.5.1 Frequency error

Both conducted and radiated NR BS frequency error core requirements are
the same for FR1 and FR2. Therefore, it is expected that same core
requirements can be re-used for 7 -- 24 GHz frequencies.

##### 7.4.1.5.2 EVM

Both conducted and radiated NR BS EVM core requirements for QPSK, 16QAM,
64QAM or 256QAM have been defined for FR1 and FR2 with the same core
requirement values. Therefore, it is expected the same core requirement
values can be re-used for 7-24 GHz frequencies.

Some aspects such as EVM window length differ between FR1 and FR2 and
will need further consideration for 7 -- 24 GHz range.

##### 7.4.1.5.3 TAE

TAE core requirements for MIMO and inter-band CA with or without MIMO
are the same for FR1 and FR2 and therefore it is expected they can be
re-used also for 7 -- 24 GHz frequencies.

For intra-band CA TAE differs between FR1 and FR2 due to difference in
supported SCS. Intra-band CA TAE can be derived once the set of
supported SCS is known for 7 -- 24 GHz frequencies.

#### 7.4.1.6 ACLR

BS ACLR requirements are derived, along with the UE ACS requirements
from the downlink co-existence simulations. The simulations provide an
ACIR value which is then shared between the BS ACLR and the UE ACS with
the bias on the UE ACS being the less strict requirements so that UE
complexity can be kept at a minimum, where:

$$ACLR = - 10\log_{10}\left( 10^{\frac{- ACS}{10}} + 10^{\frac{- ACLR}{10}} \right)$$

FR1 systems currently all have the same ACLR/ACS values for all
operating bands, FR2 has different requirements depending on the
operating band as summarized below:

Table 7.4.1.6-1: DL ACIR, BS ACLR and UE ACS values

For FR2 the co-existence simulations have been carried out based on AAS
beam forming architectures, for FR1 the original values were derived for
non-AAS 3 sectored sites with passive antennas and these results were
then verified to ensure that AAS beam forming implementation did not
negatively impact the network throughput.

From the existing requirements and the results of the co-existence
simulations used to derive them it is clear that ACIR and hence BS ACLR
are frequency dependent. In addition the distribution of the ACIR budget
between BA ACLR and UE ACS varies over frequency with the ACLR
allocation increasing with frequency as PA linearity becomes harder to
achieve.

There are a number of key simulation parameters which vary over
frequency which may influence the co-existence simulation:

\- Path Loss (increases by approximately 20 log f)

\- Due to higher Path Loss cells are smaller so average distance to UE
is smaller

\- BS Antenna gain is higher

\- BS total output power drops with frequency

\- UE's antennas are directional

\- UE NF is higher.

Some of these parameters change naturally with frequency but some may be
step functions with technological breakpoints.

It is also important to consider the deployment scenarios which are
identified for identified bands as these are very important parameter in
the co-existence analysis.

As such it is important that co-existence simulations are carried out on
specific bands (or ranges) as they are identified. The 7 -- 24 GHz
region covers almost 3 octaves so there may be more than 1 ACIR (and
hence BS ACLR) requirements over the 7 -- 24 GHz range.

The split between BS ACLR and UE ACS should also be decided on a band
specific basis based on the relative difficulty in implementing each in
the BS and UE respectively.

#### 7.4.1.7 Operating Bands Unwanted emissions (OBUE)

##### 7.4.1.7.1 General

Unwanted emission limits for Base Stations (as well as UEs) depend
heavily on regulation. Present NR BS limits are defined with an
Operating Band Unwanted Emission requirement covering the operating
band, including the Out-of-band domain and a small part of the spurious
domain outside of the operating band.

##### 7.4.1.7.2 OBUE limits in FR1 and FR2 {#obue-limits-in-fr1-and-fr2 .list-paragraph}

The unwanted emission limits for NR BS follow the same principles as was
used for LTE BS, and to some extent also UMTS BS. These are shown in
figure 7.4.1.7.2-1. Instead of just defining a spectrum mask for the
out-of-band domain close to the transmitter BS carrier, an Operating
Band Unwanted Emissions (OBUE) mask is defined across the operating
band, extending also outside the band. Close to the RF carrier, the OBUE
mask has limits that drops in several step down to a "baseline" level
that extends out to an offset Δf~OBUE~ outside the edges of the
operating band.

The OBUE limits will in general cover both the *out-of-band domain* and
parts of the *spurious domain* of unwanted emissions, as defined by the
ITU-R \[7\]. The OBUE limits close to the transmitted carrier are in
general within the Out-of-band domain. These limits are based on RAN4
considerations including implementation aspects and to some extent also
regulation. The steps in the mask are mostly between "flat" limits, but
"sloped" limits are also used in some cases.

Figure 7.4.1.7.2-1: Principle for OBUE limits used for NR BS

The "extended" part of the mask will to a large extent be within the
spurious domain and must therefore align with regulation for spurious
emissions. For Category A limits, there is no concept defined in
regulation that supports having different limits in the OBUE range than
in the rest of the spurious domain, so the limits are the same as the
spurious emission limits defined outside the OBUE range.

For Category B limits, the recent version of European regulation \[17\]
explicitly allows for a reduced reference bandwidth within a frequency
range set relative to the operating band edges (instead of relative to
the centre frequency of emission). This in 3GPP implemented through the
OBUE, with the reduced measurement bandwidth translated into an adjusted
emission limit. For operation above 24.25 GHz, the regulation in \[17\]
defines an explicit OBUE mask with limits set in three steps, which has
been implemented in NR BS specs for FR2.

Note that additional limits may apply regionally in the OBUE frequency
range to protect other services.

In FR1, the OBUE limits for NR BS \[5\] are implemented in different
frequency ranges as outlined in table 7.4.1.7.2‑1. The offset Δf~OBUE~
for the OBUE limits is 10 or 40 MHz depending on BS type and the width
of the downlink operating band. The higher number is used for BS defined
with OTA or Hybrid limits in bands 100 MHz or wider, and for BS with
conducted limits in bands 200 MHz or wider. The shape of the mask is
very similar to the LTE mask. A tighter Option 2 mask for Category B is
defined for some bands, based on specific European regulation.

In FR2, OBUE limits for NR BS \[5\] are defined for a limited number of
bands up to 40 GHz as outlined in table 7.4.1.7.2‑1. They all have an
offset Δf~OBUE~ of 1500 MHz. The OBUE mask shape is based on the IMT
characteristics submitted to the ITU-R during the initial work on NR
\[13\]. While this is basically unchanged for Category B in the 3GPP
specs, the Category B mask has an additional step defined and a limit
based on the new regulation for operation above 24.25 GHz in \[17\].

While the limits follow the same principle, there are both similarities
and differences:

\- Both in FR1 and FR2, there is a 3GPP specified NR specific mask
defined in the out-of-band domain close to the transmitter carrier(s).
This part of the mask is fixed in FR1 independent of bandwidth (out to
10 MHz), while it scales with the transmitted bandwidth (BW~contiguous~)
in FR2.

\- Both in FR1 and FR2, the OBUE limit outside the NR specific part
mentioned above, are based on international regulation for spurious
emissions (Category A and Category B) taken from \[7\] and \[17\].

\- In FR1, the offset Δf~OBUE~ outside the band edges is quite small (10
-- 40 MHz), originally based on the 5 MHz channel bandwidth of UTRA and
later also applied for LTE, plus some considerations of implementation
for AAS BS (BS type 1-H and BS type 1-O).

\- In FR2, the offset Δf~OBUE~ outside the band edges is much larger
(1500 MHz), considering the much higher maximum channel bandwidth of NR
and the more difficult implementation aspects in mm-Wave frequency
ranges.

+----------------------------------+----------------------------------+

The main difference between OBUE in FR1 and FR2 is the much higher
Δf~OBUE~ in FR2, which takes both the higher NR channel bandwidths and
the implementation aspects at higher frequencies into account.

##### 7.4.1.7.3 OBUE limits in 7 -- 24 GHz {#obue-limits-in-7-24-ghz .list-paragraph}

In the 7 -- 24 GHz range, there will also be a need for higher Δf~OBUE~
values than in FR1. The specific Δf~OBUE~ value will vary for different
example frequencies and depend mainly on width of the downlink operating
band and the relation to the fundamental frequency.

The unwanted emissions mask in 7 -- 24 GHz could use the same OBUE
principle as used in FR1 and FR2. As both FR1 and FR2 emission mask are
band-centric, the mask for 7 -- 24 GHz can be also assumed as
band-centric. Higher Δf~OBUE,~ than in FR1 needs to be considered with
an approach similar to FR2 and should be further studied in relation to
possible implementations at example frequencies.

The shape of the OBUE mask in the out-of-band domain (close to the
carrier) will also need consideration. For the OBUE mask, the limits
shall also follow the corresponding regulation for Category A or
Category B. Since there is presently no explicit regulation of mobile
services in the bands, the starting point could be the existing mask
shapes used in FR1 and FR2. The following aspects should be taken into
account:

\- ACLR values

\- Output power

\- Frequency ranges

\- Transmission bandwidth

#### 7.4.1.8 Spurious emissions

##### 7.4.1.8.1 General

In the Study on 7 -- 24 GHz frequency range, spectrum regulation for
specific frequency ranges is outside the scope of the study item (except
the survey on existing regulation across regions). It is however of
interest to look at the more generic regulation of unwanted emissions,
which is a fundamental aspect for defining RF requirements.

##### 7.4.1.8.2 International regulation (ITU-R)

Spurious emission is regulated through the international Recommendation
ITU-R SM.329 \[7\], which is used as a reference in 3GPP specifications.
There is a difference in reference bandwidth over different frequency
ranges of the spurious in *Recommends 4.1* in Recommendation ITU-R
SM.329-12 \[7\] but those are applicable regardless of operating
frequency (also called as fundamental frequency). For Category B
spurious emissions (from European regulation, see below), there is a
difference in limits below and above 1 GHz.

There is a restriction in the frequency range of the spurious domain for
practical purposes in *Recommend 2.5* of Recommendation ITU-R SM.329-12
\[7\], where in particular the upper limit to use for measurements
depends on the fundamental frequency, as shown in table 7.4.1.8.2‑1 for
the frequency ranges relevant for NR.

As seen in table 7.4.1.8.2‑1, the recommended upper limit for
measurements in the 7 -- 13 GHz range is 26 GHz, while for 13 -- 24 GHz,
the upper limit is the 2^nd^ harmonic.

Table 7.4.1.8.2‑1: Frequency range for measurement of spurious emissions
(from \[7\])

  Fundamental frequency range   Frequency range for measurements   
  ----------------------------- ---------------------------------- ----------------
                                Lower limit                        Upper limit
  300 MHz -- 600 MHz            30 MHz                             3 GHz
  600 MHz -- 5.2 GHz                                               5^th^ harmonic
  5.2 GHz -- 13 GHz                                                26 GHz
  13 GHz -- 150 GHz                                                2^nd^ harmonic

There is also Recommendation ITU-R SM.328 \[42\], but it deals more with
general principles and serves as a guidance for limits in the
out-of-band domain, but has no specific limits documented. There are
however very specific limits defined in Recommendation ITU-R M.1580
\[43\] for UTRA and ITU-R M.2070 \[44\] for E-UTRA, but these
recommendations are fundamentally based on 3GPP limits. Similar
recommendation are expected to be developed for IMT-2020, where limits
for NR would be based on the submission of NR to ITU-R as a candidate
IMT-2020 system.

In summary, there are presently no specific ITU-R limits documented for
7 -- 24 GHz or above -- the generic spurious emission limits in
recommendations are homogeneous for operation above 1 GHz, except for
the variation in the spurious frequency range for measurement, which
depends on the fundamental frequency.

##### 7.4.1.8.3 European regulation (CEPT)

Europe applies the Category B emission limits documented in
Recommendation ITU-R SM.329 \[7\]. These limits are based on the
European ERC Recommendation 74-01 \[34\] and are more stringent than the
general Category A limits. There is also a broader ECC recommendation
(02)05 \[45\] on unwanted emissions, but it has no recommendation for
specific limits.

There has been a recent revision of ERC Recommendation 74-01\[34\],
making it not fully aligned with the corresponding Category B limits in
ITU-R. There are new specific limits for "Base Stations using AAS and
beamforming with integrated antennas" covering operation below 6 GHz and
above 24.25 GHz. No new limits are defined in the 6 -- 24.25 GHz range,
motivated by lack of information on such BS operating in that range. It
is stated in ECC Recommendation 74-01 \[34\] that these could be
considered in a future revision as necessary. For non-AAS BS, the
general Category B limits apply in Europe.

Next revision of ECC Recommendation 74-01 \[34\] is expected in 3 years'
time according to the normal procedure, which means that ECC may
initiate a work item for an update around 2021-22. It is however
possible to initiate work on such limits earlier if needed for mobile
systems.

The Category B limits applicable to AAS BS below 6 GHz and above 24.25
GHz are shown in figure 7.4.1.8.3-1 and 7.4.1.8.3-2 respectively. It
should be noted that the limits below 6 GHz are equivalent to the
conducted limits in the same frequency range, while above 24.25 GHz,
there are several changes made in the updated European regulation.

Figure 7.4.1.8.3-2: Specific Category B mask for spurious domain
emissions for Base Stations using AAS and beamforming operating above
24.25 GHz (from \[17\])

For the updated limits above 24.25 GHz in figure 7.4.1.8.3-2, the
following differences in the updated ERC Recommendation 74‑01 \[34\]
compared to the legacy conducted limits should be noted:

1\. There is a relaxation of limits close to the transmitted carrier(s)
in the spurious domain, but the "mask" defined is *operating band
centric* instead of *carrier centric*.\
NOTE: Such on operating band centric mask was allowed also previously
(and implemented in 3GPP), but it was not explicitly described in the
recommendation.

2\. The reference BW for the limits is 10 MHz, changed from the previous
1 MHz.

3\. The limits at large offsets from the operating band (more than Fe)
is -20 dBm/10 MHz, which is equivalent (for broadband emissions) to the
conducted limits of -30 dBm/1 MHz.

4\. The limits at smaller offsets from the operating band and inside the
band allow in many cases for higher levels than the conducted limits.

NOTE: There is in addition a "reference bandwidth mask" in ERC
Recommendation 74‑01 \[34\] defined for conducted limits which allows up
to a 15 dB relaxation, but it is not expressed using the new 10 MHz
reference bandwidth and the offsets are *carrier centric*.

##### 7.4.1.8.4 Other regional regulation

While there are additional countries outside of Europe that apply
Category B limits, there is a general applicability of Category A
limits, where the only variation with the operation frequency is the
recommended frequency range for measurements, as shown in
table 7.4.1.8.2‑1.

As an example, Japan develops specific unwanted emission regulation for
new bands, but has no generic regulation in frequency ranges where no
bands are presently defined, such as 7 -- 24 GHz. The same is true for
FCC, which has specific emission limits for each band and type of
service, but no generic unwanted emission regulation of emissions that
would presently apply in 7 -- 24 GHz for mobile service.

##### 7.4.1.8.5 Possible new limits in 7 -- 24 GHz

As observed above, while limits in 7 -- 24 GHz exist for Category A and
for Category B non-AAS, an update of ERC Recommendation 74-01 \[34\] to
add limits for AAS BS in 6 -- 24.25 GHz will be needed for Category B
for Europe.

Similar to the limits developed for above 24.25 GHz, the general
Category B limit of ‑30 dBm could remain, but the reference bandwidth
can possibly be changed, and the limit correspondingly scaled. Note that
in the present ERC Recommendation 74-01 \[34\], such a changed bandwidth
is allowed down to 18 GHz.

The new spurious emission limits in 7 -- 24 GHz could in this way use a
similar approach as for above 24.25 GHz, in particular in the upper part
of 7 -- 24 GHz. This means applying a larger reference bandwidth
together with an explicit operating band centric mask. At lower
frequencies closer to 6 GHz, an in-between solution giving a smoother
transition to the limits in figure 7.4.1.8.3-1 may be implemented.
Further studies will be needed for what reference bandwidth that are
possible below 18 GHz, also from a victim point of view.

The frequency offsets needed for defining the separation between the
spurious emissions and an operating band centric OBUE mask may be
different from the ones above 24.25 GHz.

#### 7.4.1.9 TX IMD

TX IMD is specified under the assumption that the BS is co-located with
another BS of the same class, output power and antenna configuration.
The reverse interferer specified in the TX IMD requirement is therefore
based on the BS output power (as interfering BS is assumed to be the
same power) and the isolation between the 2 systems.

\- For *BS type 1-C* the isolation between the victim and aggressor
antenna ports is 30 dB.

\- For *BS type 1-H* an intra system requirement is defined.

\- For *BS type 1-O* co-location a *co-location reference anten*na is
specified and placed physically at a distance of 10cm from AAS BS and
the full BS power is fed into it as an interferer.

For FR2 the OTA scenario is the same however it can be shown that the
isolation is such that the requirement becomes unnecessary.

Under these conditions the BS must meet all the emission requirements.

The necessity of the TX IMD requirement can be analyzed by understanding
the isolation, the aggressor Pout and the emissions requirements
(notably ACLR), as frequency increases the ACLR requirement is smaller,
achievable Pout is lower and isolation increases. As none of these
parameters will be decided for the 7 - 24 GHz region will be agreed in
the SI the need for TX IMD cannot be accurately analyzed however it is
clear as the frequency increases the needed for a TX IMD requirements
reduces.

If a Tx IMD requirement is needed in the 7 -- 24 GHz region then it will
be a co-location requirement, co-location in the 7 -- 24 GHz region has
a number of implementation issues, which may require a new method of
injecting the interfering signal. For summary of the co-location
requirements refer to clause 7.4.1.10.

#### 7.4.1.10 Co-location requirements

##### 7.4.1.10.1 General

For FR1 BS requirements there are 4 different categories of requirements
which are specified using the co-location reference antenna concept (see
TS 38.141-2 \[6\]):

\- Spurious emissions (i.e. Protection of the BS receiver of own or
different BS, and co-location requirement)

\- Transmitter ON/ OFF power level (see clause 7.4.1.4)

\- Transmitter intermodulation (see clause 7.4.1.9)

\- Out-of-band co-location blocking (see clause 7.4.2.5.4)

For BS type 2-O there are currently no co-location requirements
specified. It has been shown that the increased isolation between
co-located BS and the lower ACLR requirements mean transmitter
intermodulation requirements are not needed. For FR2 BS, the transmitter
ON/OFF power requirement is specified as a TRP requirement. Transmitter
spurious emissions and out-of-band co-location blocking requirements
have been not specified in release 15 of the TS 38.104 \[5\] as
co-location between FR2 systems with the current band allocation is not
seen as very probable.

In addition, it has been shown that due to the high isolation between
FR1 and FR2 antennas that no co-location requirements are needed between
FR1 and FR2 or vice versa.

For *BS type 1-O* the co-location scenarios are defined as having a
co-location reference antenna placed at a distance (edge to edge) of
10 cm from the BS. At this distance the worst case isolation found
between two passive 2 GHz BS antennas was 30 dB. The same coupling
factor of 30 dB has been used to derive all the conducted co-location
requirements for *BS type 1-C* and *BS type 1-H*.

The coupling assumption and the definition of the co-location reference
antenna are based on the co-located system being the same frequency as
the BS as this is assumed worst case. For OTA requirements when the
co-located system is a different frequency the co-location reference
antenna is one suitable for that frequency. This method assumes that the
co-located system is in a band where a non-AAS BS and passive antenna
are used.

##### 7.4.1.10.2 Co-location emissions

If there are no co-location requirement then we can assume that worst
case the BS will be radiating CAT B emissions levels and co-location of
two base station can't be guaranteed without degradation of the victim
base station sensitivity.

Using the noise figure from the technology overview in table 5.5.1-1 and
assume the same degradation of victim sensitivity as for FR1 base
station (1dB degradation) the emission level at the victim can be
determined. A similar level of protection to the victim receiver as
provided for FR1 the co-location noise in the victim must conservatively
be less than -110dBm/100 kHz. If CAT B emissions are assumed then an
isolation of at least 70dB will be required, this is greater than the
isolation assumed for FR2 and as such it seems likely that co-location
emissions requirements of some sort are required in the 7 -- 24 GHz
region.

Considering the BS type 1-O style co-location requirements they have
three difficulties when considering their use at higher frequencies:

\- The emissions power levels out of the co-location reference antenna
required to secure the victim receiver sensitivity are very low as such
difficult to measure.

\- Define a relevant co-location scenario; e.g. distance between
co-location reference antenna and base station.

\- The antennas used for conformance testing (co-location test antennas)
must be identified and a range of different antennas may be required.

Because of these difficulties it may be necessary to develop a general
concept without dependencies to a legacy passive BS antenna.

For type *BS type x~FR~-C* and *BS type x~FR~-H* type of requirements
the antenna-to-antenna isolation needs careful consideration.

For *BS type 1-O* the emissions power levels are set at the output of
the co-location reference antenna and are very low and as such requires
a very low noise figure test system to measure and requires that the
test system noise is calibrated out from the final measurement.

For a higher frequency system, we predict that the noise figure and
hence the wanted signal power level for the receiver sensitivity
requirement will be higher and hence the co-location power level will be
similarly higher, however the same high noise figure will impact the
measurement equipment. The effect on the measurement equipment could be
greater than that on the BS receiver as not only the higher LNA NF but
also cable loss etc. have to be taken into account. As such the
measurement of the power level is likely to become harder in the 7 - 24
GHz frequency region.

The availability of passive BS antennas in the 7 - 24 GHz frequency
region is also likely to be a problem. Many frequency bands will rely on
OTA only systems which do not have traditional passive antenna. As such
co-location test antennas will have to be designed specifically for the
purpose and will not represent a real scenario as is intended with the
existing *BS type 1-O* co-location requirements.

Specifying and measuring co-location emissions levels in the 7 - 24 GHz
region is more difficult than in *BS type 1-O* and may require an
alternative approach.

#### 7.4.1.11 Co-existence requirements

##### 7.4.1.11.1 General

Co-existence emissions requirements are captured as additional
requirements in the spurious emissions part of the specification. The
requirements may be applied for the protection of system operating in
frequency ranges other than the BS downlink *operating band* as an
optional protection of such systems that are deployed in the same
geographical area as the BS.

In release 15 there are co-existence emissions requirements specified
for FR1 but not for FR2.

##### 7.4.1.11.2 Background

FR1 requirements are based on the analysis done for UTRA BS as
documented in TR 25.942 \[22\].

The scenario considered is an un-coordinated cell layout with and ISD of
500 m, where the victim BS is 288 m ($\frac{500}{\sqrt{3} = 288}$) from
the aggressor.

height="2.160332458442695in"}

Figure 7.4.1.3.2-1 Co-existence in same geographical area scenario

For FR1 the emissions level is calculated at 2GHz and the same value is
used for all frequencies. Whilst it is the case that as frequency
increases the path loss increases the ISD may also shrink (for the same
reason) so this is a reasonable assumption.

FR2 release 16 has no co-existence emissions requirements, as with
co-location emissions this is due to the low number of FR2 bands making
co-existence unlikely. In addition the high path loss and the beam
forming nature of FR2 systems make interference between BS more
unlikely. No co-existence requirements have been created for FR2.

##### 7.4.1.11.3 Co-existence emissions

In the 7 -- 24 GHz region it is expected the lower frequencies may
behave more like FR1 and the higher frequencies may like FR2. Further
study is needed to determine whether co-existence requirements are
needed, depending on the specific frequency and band.

### 7.4.2 Receiver requirements

#### 7.4.2.1 Rx requirements overview

Summary of the conducted and radiated Rx requirements specified in
Rel-15 for the NR BS is presented in this clause. More detailed
elaboration on the motivation on selected requirements is provided in
dedicated clauses below.

All the findings captured for the conducted requirements in table
7.4.2.1-1 and related clauses below are considered to be applicable to
the sub-range of the 7 -- 24 GHz for which the conducted requirements
will be found to be feasible during related WI.

While radiated requirements are considered to be applicable to the whole
7 -- 24 GHz range, their definitions, values and levels may differ
across the 7 -- 24 GHz range.

#### 7.4.2.2 Receiver sensitivity

##### 7.4.2.2.1 Background

There are a number of different receiver sensitivity requirements for
the different BS types and frequency ranges, these requirements fulfil 2
roles;

\- Minimum sensitivity which guarantees a certain minimum power level at
which the specified throughput can be met.

\- Reference sensitivity which is a reference performance which is used
as a basis for the wanted signal power level during the interference
tests (blocking, RX IMD, etc.)

In the case of the *BS type 1-C*, and *BS type 2-O* these 2 are both
achieved with a single requirement.

  Minimum sensitivity     conducted REFSENS   OTA sensitivity     OTA sensitivity     OTA REFSENS (FR2)
  Reference sensitivity   conducted REFSENS   conducted REFSENS   OTA REFSENS (FR1)   OTA REFSENS (FR2)

Conducted REFSENS is based on the BS receiver having a noise figure of 5
dB (wide area):

$$P_{\text{REFSENS}} = P_{\text{kT}} + 10*\log_{10}\left( \text{BW} \right) + IM + SNR + NF$$

OTA REFENS is represented as an EIS value and also assumes a maximum
noise figure as well as an antenna gain:

$$\text{EIS}_{\text{REFSENS}} = P_{\text{kT}} + 10*\log_{10}\left( \text{BW} \right) + IM + SNR + NF + G_{\text{ANT}}$$

The difficulty with adding the antenna gain parameter is that antenna
gain is a variable and it is not possible to attribute a minimum or
fixed value. Even with non-AAS BS with passive antennas the antenna gain
varies with deployment. For a passive antenna the beam shape is fixed
and hence is directly related to the geographical area the antenna
covers or the range of angle of arrival (RoAoA), the larger the RoAoA
the lower the antenna gain and hence the higher the minimum EIS.

##### 7.4.2.2.2 Conducted sensitivity

The conducted sensitivity requirement is based on the agreed minimum
noise figure for the operating band being considered as well as the CBW
and reference channel (FRC) as well as the SNR and implementation margin
as follows:

$$P_{\text{REFSENS}}\left( \text{dBm} \right) = - 174dBm + 10*\log_{10}\left( \text{BW}_{\text{FRC}} \right) + N_{F} + I_{M} + SNR$$

Where:

\- BW~FRC~ is the transmission bandwidth of the FRC.

\- N~F~ is BS noise figure, equal to 5 dB for Wide Area BS, 10 dB for
Medium Range BS and 13 dB for Local Area BS.

\- I~M~ is the implementation margin, equal to 2 dB.

\- SNR is the SNR value for which we reach 95% throughput. Each company
provided simulation results, and average will be done for each BW.

Typical values for 7 -- 24 GHz BS noise figure have been discussed in
clause 5.5.1 and these will clearly affect the conducted reference
sensitivity level, however the channel band widths in the 7 -- 24 GHz
range are not yet known as this may also influence the requirements and
the specified FRC's as such the reference sensitivity level do not need
to be defined in the SI.

##### 7.4.2.2.3 OTA sensitivity

The OTA sensitivity requirement is a minimum sensitivity requirement and
ensures correct operation of the receiver including the integral
antenna. OTA sensitivity is a declared parameter, the minimum
sensitivity over an associated range of angle of arrivals (RoAoA) are
declared (the declaration also allows for the RoAoA to be redirected by
non-real time means but this distinction is not needed for simple
analysis).

##### 7.4.2.2.4 OTA REFSENS

OTA REFSENS is the OTA reference sensitivity requirement which provided
equivalence to the existing conducted requirements as both a reference
for the interference measurements but also providing some equivalence to
the minimum noise figure aspect of the conducted requirement.

As antenna gain is a variable a fixed OTA sensitivity value is not
possible, however as antenna gain varies with coverage it is possible to
provide a minimum expected gain (and therefore a minimum sensitivity)
over a declared coverage area. Hence the declared RoAoA is used to
calculate a minimum antenna gain and hence a reference sensitivity. The
declared RoAoA corresponds to the 3 dB contour of the antenna gain and
is called the *OTA REFSENS RoAoA*.

FR2 has no conducted requirements and no need for equivalence with
legacy requirements, as such the sensitivity requirements are OTA only.
However the issue still exists that different products may have
different maximum antenna gains. In the case of FR2 however beam forming
is necessary and hence the coverage area (or RoAoA) is not directly
related to the antenna gain as a narrow beam can be steered over the
RoAoA. This was not the case in FR1 where the AAS may not have beam
steering capability.

The link between the RoAoA and sensitivity is hence not existed in FR2,
the OTA sensitivity is hence a purely declared variable within a range
of expected antenna gains.

##### 7.4.2.2.5 7 - 24 GHz

At this stage we must consider all the BS types for the 7 -- 24 GHz
range, however it is clear that OTA BS will be an important
implementation. OTA REFSENS will hence be necessary.

OTA REFSENS is slightly different for FR1 and FR2 BS, for FR1 the
antenna gain is directly related to the RoAoA as it offers equivalence
with the conducted requirement and may need to be applied to non-beam
forming architectures. For FR2 it is assumed that the system is beam
forming and hence there is no link between the antenna gain and the
RoAoA, also there is no equivalence to a conducted requirement.

The 7 - 24 GHz BS is expected to require beam forming and whilst there
may be conducted requirements there is no legacy so there is no need to
provide equivalence between OTA and conducted requirements. As such the
FR2 type of OTA REFSENS requirement may be used even if conducted
specifications are specified. The appropriate NF and ranges of expected
antenna gain can be agreed when the exact operating bands are known.

Conducted requirements for *BS type x~FR~-C* and *BS type x~FR~-H* are
based on expected noise figure and hence if needed can easily be derived
using the same noise figure values as the OTA REFSENS requirement.

#### 7.4.2.3 Dynamic range

##### 7.4.2.3.1 General 

The following is considered to be applicable to both the conducted and
radiated dynamic range requirements:

\- For the values of the implementation margin, it cannot be precluded
that different IM values could be selected for the sub-ranges of 7 -- 24
GHz range, leading to different values of the requirements across the
frequency.

\- The throughput threshold to derive the required SNR for the wanted
signal derivation (i.e. 95% of the FRC) can be reused for 7 -- 24 GHz
range.

\- The 16QAM-based FRCs (for the NRB and SCS that will be supported in
the 7 -- 24 GHz range) can be reused for 7 -- 24 GHz range.

##### 7.4.2.3.2 Conducted dynamic range

The conducted dynamic range requirement for 7 -- 24 GHz sub-range will
have to be re-calculated:

\- For the wanted and interfering signal levels will have to be
re-calculated to account for an updated NF values and the supported set
of NRB and SCS, as well as the implementation margin (IM).

\- For the wanted signal: required SNR will be subject to the simulation
campaigns.

##### 7.4.2.3.3 OTA dynamic range

For the OTA dynamic range requirement the following was concluded:

\- For the FR1-like sub-range of the 7 -- 24 GHz range: the same
approach of deriving the OTA requirement from the conducted dynamic
range requirement can be reused, i.e. conducted requirement plus
ΔOTAREFSENS offset.

\- For the FR2-like sub-range of the 7 -- 24 GHz range: as there was no
such requirement defined for FR2, further investigation will be required
to decide if the OTA dynamic range requirement in the FR2-like sub-range
of 7 -- 24 GHz range can be skipped. Based on the estimated dynamic
range value(s), the FR2 BS demodulation requirements could be also
considered to assess for the required SNR values (and their relation to
the noise floor levels), to further evaluate the need for the OTA
dynamic range requirement in FR2-like sub-range of 7 -- 24 GHz range.

#### 7.4.2.4 In-band blocking

##### 7.4.2.4.1 Background

In-band blocking levels are identified by using co-existence simulations
to identify the CDF of in-band interference levels. For conducted system
analysis only the interferer was considered, however for OTA systems
this method is not suitable as the level varies depending on the
architecture of the victim

\- An RF beam forming system applies the beam forming to both the wanted
signal and the interferer. As such if the interferer is in the same
direction as the wanted signal it is much larger, however the
probability of this occurring is low. If the interferer is in a
different direction then it is attenuated by the beam forming.

\- A BB beam forming system only applies the beam forming in the BB,
therefore the RF front end is exposed to only the element gain. The
element gain is much lower, however the beam is wider and hence the
probability of the gain being applied is greater.

In addition it was found that the direction of the worst case blockers
is not stable and hence testing the worst case interferer level in the
reference direction may result in a level which is not consistent with
the findings of the simulation. For compliance it is preferable to have
the interferer and the wanted signal coming from the same direction.

For the OTA requirements however it was found that the ratio between the
wanted signal and the in-band interferer was less dependent on the
architecture so by setting the blocking level as an offset from the OTA
REFSENS offered an architecturally independent method for setting the
blocking level.

The FR1 and FR2 in-band clocking specs are hence:

Figure 7.4.2.4.1-1: Wide area in-band blocking wanted signal and
interferer levels

                           *BS type 1-C*   *BS type 1-H*   *BS type 1-O*              *BS type 2-O*
  ------------------------ --------------- --------------- -------------------------- --------------------------------------
  Wanted signal (dBm)      -101.7 + 6      -101.7 + 6      -101.7 - ΔOTAREFSENS + 6   EISREFSENS\_50M + ΔFR2\_REFSENS + 6
  Interferer level (dBm)   -43             -43             -43 - ΔOTAREFSENS          EISREFSENS\_50M + 33 + ΔFR2\_REFSENS
  Delta (dB)               52.7            52.7            52.7                       27

It can be seen all the FR1 levels are consistent and the FR2 levels is
lower.

##### 7.4.2.4.2 7 - 24 GHz

In-band requirements dependent on the sensitivity requirements, as the
sensitivity is used as a metric of the receiver performance under
interference conditions. The in-band blocking requirement for 7 - 24 GHz
must therefore be consistent worth the methodology used for sensitivity.
The proposed metrics for sensitivity are identified in clause 7.4.2.2.

As the 7 - 24 GHz specification has to deal with all the BS types and
implementation architectures the in-band blocking level should be set
based on the wanted signal to interferer level in the same way as the
FR2 levels. The conducted requirement can then be extracted by using the
same delta on the conducted REFSENS value. As there are no existing
conducted requirements to maintain equivalence to and the 7 -- 24 GHz
range will primarily consider beam forming systems it is suitable to
derive the OTA requirements first and then apply the same methodology to
the conducted.

The delta value for the 7 - 24 GHz range would be expected to be between
the FR1 and FR2 values (52.7 to 27 dB), however the precise values would
have to be found by blocking simulation once the operating frequencies
are known and co-existence simulation parameters have been defined.

Over the 7 - 24 GHz range it is possible there are multiple in-band
blocking deltas covering different frequency ranges.

#### 7.4.2.5 Out-of-band blocking requirements

##### 7.4.2.5.1 General

The out-of-band blocking requirement relies on the sensitivity as
reference. The base station is illuminated with a wanted signal and an
interferer signal at the same time maintaining specified link quality.
Hence, the FRC used for conformance testing must support the carrier
bandwidth to be supported for the frequency range 7 - 24 GHz.

##### 7.4.2.5.2 Background

There are NR BS type specific concepts for how the out-of-band blocking
requirement is defined with respect to the wanted signal power used as
reference for the requirement, see table 7.4.2.5.2-1.

**Table 7.4.2.5.2-1: Wanted signal characteristics**

+----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+
|                      | **Wanted signal      | **Wanted signal      |

+----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+

For *BS type 1-C* and *BS type 1-H*, reference sensitivity (P~REFSENS~)
is used as reference for out-of-band receiver blocking. For *BS type
1-O*, the minimum sensitivity (EIS~minSENS~) relating to the full array
antenna sensitivity is used as reference while for *BS type 2-O*, the
reference sensitivity (EIS~REFSENS~) relating to the antenna
element/sub-array sensitivity is used as reference. In all cases these
parameters represent the minimum sensitivity requirements, see clause
7.4.2.2.1.

The conducted requirement defined for *BS type 1-C* and *BS type 1-H* is
only defined for FR1. It is based on the analysis done for UTRA BS and
the derivation of the -15 dBm conducted interferer level is based on
interference analysis showing that worst case interference is from other
BS at approximately the same frequency.

For simplicity, it is treated as the worst case and applied to the whole
test frequency range up to 12.75 GHz which is shown below in table
7.4.2.5.2-2.

The OTA requirement is defined for both FR1 and FR2 (which are concluded
below in table 7.4.2.5.2-2) and it can be found that a discontinuity
point of the FR2 requirement occurs at 12.75 GHz.

+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+

The interferer signal level 0.36 V/m from 30 MHz to 12750 MHz is based
on the calculation of -15 dBm conducted interferer signal level at
frequency 2000 MHz and 17 dBi antenna gain and a distance between
aggressor and victim of 30 m.

The EIRP at the aggressor is then calculated as:

EIRP(30m) = P~rx~ -- Gant + FSPL(30m) = -15dBm -- 17dBi +
68dB(frequency=2 GHz, FSPL 30m) = 36 dBm

, where the aggressor EIRP level in linear scale is then converted to an
RMS field strength level at the victim base station as:

$$E = \frac{\sqrt{30*10^{\frac{36 - 30}{10}}}}{30} = 0.36V/m$$

For FR2 requirements the blocking signal is calculated as 0.1 V/m and
applied to the whole frequency range as shown below in figure
7.4.2.5.2-1. Note when FR2 requirements were derived no systems between
7 -- 24 GHz were considered.

The aggressor out of band BS is considered to have a total power of 29
dBm, an antenna gain of 26 dBi hence an EIRP of 55 dBm. As the aggressor
main beam is pointed at UE's at the ground, an aggressor sidelobe
suppression level of 13 dB to get the aggressor signal pointing towards
the victim is considered.

With the interferer at a distance of 200 m this gives an interfering
field strength of:

$$E = \frac{\sqrt{30*10^{\frac{\left( 55 - 13 \right) - 30}{10}}}}{200} = 0.1V/m$$

In figure 7.4.2.5.2-1, the interferer signal level is plotted for FR1
and FR2.

##### 7.4.2.5.3 Technical considerations for 7 - 24 GHz

When developing out-of-band blocking requirements for base stations
operating within the 7 - 24 GHz frequency range, RAN4 needs to consider
requirements defined for FR1 and FR2. In table 7.4.2.5.3-1, the wanted
signal characteristics is captured.

##### 7.4.2.5.4 Out-of-band co-location receiver blocking

Out-of-band co-location receiver blocking requirement is defined as
co-location requirement. Summary of the co-location requirements is
captured in clause 7.4.1.10.

For FR1 BS, requirements which are specified using assumptions on
antenna port-to-port isolation between two co-located base stations is
referred to as co-location requirements. For the receiver co-location
requirement for out-of-band blocking is specified for *BS type 1-C*, *BS
type 1-H* and *BS type 1-O*. For *BS type 2-O* there are currently no
co-location requirements specified.

In addition, it has been shown that due to the high isolation between
FR1 and FR2 antennas that no co-location requirements are needed between
FR1 and FR2 BS or vice versa.

For *BS type 1-O* the co-location scenarios are defined as having a
co-location reference antenna placed at a distance (edge to edge) of
10 cm from the BS. At this distance the worst-case isolation found
between two passive 2 GHz BS antennas was 30 dB. The same coupling
factor of 30 dB has been used to derive all the conducted co-location
requirements for *BS type 1-C* and *BS type 1-H*.

The coupling assumption and the definition of the co-location reference
antenna are based on the co-located system being the same frequency as
the BS as this is assumed worst case. For OTA requirements when the
co-located system is a different frequency the co-location reference
antenna is one suitable for that frequency. This method assumes that the
co-located system is in a band where a non-AAS BS and passive antenna
are used.

For BS operating within 7 - 24 GHz, the necessity of the out-of-band
colocation receiver blocking requirement can be analyzed by
understanding the isolation, the aggressor P~out~. As none of these
parameters will be decided for the 7 - 24 GHz region will be agreed in
the SI the need for out-of-band co-location receiver blocking cannot be
accurately analyzed. However, it is clear as the frequency increases the
need for an out-of-band co-location receiver blocking requirements
reduces.

If an out-of-band co-location receiver blocking requirement is needed in
the 7 - 24 GHz region then it will be a co-location requirement,
co-location in the 7 - 24 GHz region has a number of implementation
issues, which may require a new method of injecting the interfering
signal.

#### 7.4.2.6 Receiver spurious emissions

For conducted systems, receiver spurious emissions are specified
separately for FDD and TDD systems.

For conducted FDD systems, as the transmitter and the receiver are both
on at the same time and can be specified on separate connectors, the
receiver spurious emissions are not expected to increase the total
spurious emission level. The receiver spurious emission limit is
therefore lower than the transmitter spurious emission limit, so the
total is approximately equal to the transmitter spurious emission level.

For OTA FDD systems, the requirement is over the air and hence the
transmitter and receiver cannot be separated, so there are no receiver
spurious emission requirements needed.

For OTA TDD systems in applicable regions, the receiver spurious
emission requirements are the same as the Category B transmitter
spurious emission requirements as discussed in clause 7.4.1.8.

In certain regions, receiver spurious emission limit will be specified
during the WI based on applicable regional regulations.

#### 7.4.2.7 In-channel selectivity

##### 7.4.2.7.1 In-channel selectivity for FR1 and FR2

In-channel selectivity (ICS) is a measure of the receiver's ability to
receive a wanted signal at its assigned resource block locations in the
presence of another in-channel wanted signal received at a much larger
power spectral density.

The ICS requirement applies to FR1 (conducted and radiated requirements)
and FR2 (radiated requirement).

The conducted requirement is derived similar to E-UTRA requirement which
assumes that the UL signal is defined for 2 users, one being the
"wanted" signal and the other one being the "interfering" signal at
elevated power. Following equations are used for interfering signal and
wanted signal correspondingly.

> Interfering signal power level = -174dBm/Hz + 10\*log~10~(BW) + NF +
> ICS
>
> Wanted signal power level = -174dBm/Hz + 10\*log~10~(BW) + NF + SNR +
> IM + 3 dB

The type of interfering signal is DFT-s-OFDM NR signal and BW is
corresponding to number of RBs and SCS.

25 dBc ICS is used based on 16 dB interference-over-thermal (IOT) and 9
dB SNR considering the modulation and link level simulation.

For this conducted requirement, the modulation scheme for interfering
signal is assumed as 16QAM and modulation scheme for wanted signal is
assumed as QPSK.

For the OTA requirement, the OTA ICS for FR1 is based on conducted
requirement and an offset of Δ~minSENS~ is used for transferring the
conducted requirement to OTA requirement. However, for FR2 requirement
there is no conducted requirement to be referred to. Hence the OTA ICS
for FR2 is derived using the same equation as for conducted requirement,
with additional offset for the gain G:

> Interfering signal power level = -174dBm/Hz + 10\*log~10~(BW) + NF +
> ICS - G,
>
> Wanted signal power level = -174dBm/Hz + 10\*log10(BW) + NF + SNR + IM
> + 3dB - G;

14 dBc ICS is used based on the simulation result of IOT with 9 dB SNR
and the worst case is applied.

For radiated requirement, the modulation scheme for interfering signal
is assumed as 16QAM and modulation scheme for wanted signal is assumed
as QPSK. This is the same as the conducted requirement.

##### 7.4.2.7.2 In-channel selectivity for 7 - 24 GHz

For the FR1-like frequency range, the conducted requirements should not
be precluded. Hence, both conducted as well as radiated requirements
need to be considered in the WI phase.

The conducted in-channel selectivity for 7 -- 24 GHz will have to be
re-calculated with the following considerations:

\- The wanted and interfering signal levels of the ICS requirement will
have to be re-calculated to account for an updated NF values and the
supported set of bandwidths. For the wanted signal, the required SNR
will be subject to the simulation campaigns.

\- Similar to the FR1 requirements, BS class specific requirements for
conducted ICS need to be considered in the WI phase.

\- Selection of FRC to be used for the ICS requirement will depend on
the set of supported channel bandwidths and SCS in 7 -- 24 GHz. QPSK can
be reused from FR1.

The throughput threshold (i.e. 95%) to derive the required SNR for the
wanted signal can be reused for 7 -- 24 GHz range.

For the OTA in-channel selectivity the following was concluded:

\- For the OTA ICS, reuse the QPSK for the wanted signal (subject to the
supported channel bandwidths and SCS in 7 -- 24 GHz).

\- For the FR1-like sub-range of the 7 -- 24 GHz range:

\- BS class specific requirements for OTA ICS need to be considered in
the WI phase.

\- The same approach of deriving the OTA requirement from the conducted
one can be reused, i.e. conducted requirement plus Δ~minSENS~ offset for
both the wanted and interfering signals.

\- For the FR2-like sub-range of the 7 -- 24 GHz range:

\- The interfere signal and the wanted signal will be based on specific
FRC, SCS and also the OTA reference sensitivity requirements.

7.4.2.8 RX ACS

The following values of BS ACS and UE ACLR were defined for FR1 and FR2
frequency ranges:

Table 7.4.2.8-1: Overview of Rx ACS requirements for NR

+------+-------+--------------+--------------+-------+
|      | FR1   | FR2          |              |       |
|      |       |              |              |       |
|      |       |              |              |       |
+======+=======+==============+==============+=======+
|      | 2 GHz | 24 to 33 GHz | 37 to 52 GHz |       |
+------+-------+--------------+--------------+-------+
| ACS  | dB    | 46           | 24           | 23    |
+------+-------+--------------+--------------+-------+
| ACLR | dB    | 31           | 17           | 16    |
+------+-------+--------------+--------------+-------+
| ACIR | dB    | 30.86        | 16.21        | 15.21 |
+------+-------+--------------+--------------+-------+

To get accurate estimations on the ACIR for the range 7 -- 24 GHz the
co-existence simulations would need to be carried out. It will be done
when the bands are allocated. Based on the values in table 7.4.2.8-1 it
can be estimated that the BS ACS value for 7 -- 24 GHz range operation
would be in the range 24 to 46 dB. The split between UE ACLR and BS ACS
should also be decided on a frequency range specific basis based on the
relative difficulty in implementing each in the BS and UE respectively.

Hence we can conclude that the ACS value for the range 7 -- 24 GHz will
be in the range 24 dB to 46 dB. The exact requirement need to be decided
based on co-existence simulations during the follow-up WI.

#### 7.4.2.9 RX IMD

##### 7.4.2.9.1 RX IMD for FR1 and FR2

The blocking requirements capture the selectivity of the receiver,
whilst the receiver intermodulation given the two interferers condition
would capture the linearity of the receiver.

For FR1 both blocking and RX IMD levels were reused from E-UTRA, for FR2
the in-band blocking requirements were investigated with blocking
simulations. For RX IMD more limited simulations were performed however
the interferer RX IMD interferer levels were a very similar and 8 -- 10
dB lower than the in-band blocking levels (under the same assumptions).
A level of 8 dB below the in-band blocking levels was agreed for FR2.

For FR1 the conducted blocking interferer levels (and hence RX IMD
interferer levels) are absolute power levels, for OTA these absolute
power levels are offset by the difference between conducted reference
sensitivity and OTA REFSENS (i.e. Δ~OTAREFSENS~).

For FR2 the blocking interferer levels (and hence RX IMD interferer
levels) are offset from the declared sensitivity value
EIS~REFSENS\_50M~.

In addition to the level the interferer signal type and BW is also
important. For FR1 a CW and a modulated interferer are used with the
modulated signals BW being 5 or 20 MHz DFT-s-OFDM NR signal dependent on
the wanted signal BW. For FR2 a CW and modulated signal are also used
with the modulated signal BW being 50 MHz DFT-s-OFDM NR signal.

##### 7.4.2.9.2 RX IMD for 7 - 24 GHz

The RX IMD is closely related to the in-band blocking, for both FR1 and
FR2 the RX IMD levels have been between 8 to 9 dB lower than the in-band
blocking levels. It is likely that the same will be found in the 7 - 24
GHz frequency range once operating frequencies are known and
co-existence simulation parameters have been defined.

As with the blocking the in-band interference requirements are dependent
on the sensitivity requirements, as the sensitivity is used as a metric
of the receiver performance under interference conditions. The RX IMD
requirement for 7 - 24 GHz must therefore be consistent with the
methodology used for sensitivity. The proposed metrics for sensitivity
are identified in clause 7.4.2.2.

The RX IMD interferer levels are offset from the blocking levels.

The interferer signal definition are the same for FR1 and FR2 with the
exception of the modulated signal BW, this will depend on the BW's
defined for the operating band and may vary in the 7 - 24 GHz range.

7.5 BS EMC requirements
-----------------------

### 7.5.1 General

The EMC requirements for the NR BS and ancillary equipment are defined
in TS 38.113 \[3\], including emission requirements and immunity
requirements. Background on derivation of selected EMC requirements for
the AAS BS architecture was captured in the NR technical report
TR 38.817-02 \[4\].

### 7.5.2 Emission requirements

#### 7.5.2.1 Conducted requirements

Irrespective of the BS architecture (i.e. non-AAS or AAS architecture)
considered for the NR operation in 7 -- 24 GHz frequency range, the
following EMC emission requirements can be directly reused from the
existing NR BS specification TS 38.113 \[3\]:

\- Conducted emission DC power input/output port

\- Conducted emissions, AC mains power input/output port

\- Conducted emissions, telecommunication port

\- Harmonic Current emissions (AC mains input port)

\- Voltage fluctuations and flicker (AC mains input port)

The only EMC emissions requirement which has dependency on the BS
architecture is the radiated emission requirement.

#### 7.5.2.2 Radiated emission requirements

Based on the discussion on EMC radiated emission requirements for the NR
BS, the following findings are also applicable to the NR BS operation in
the 7 -- 24 GHz frequency range:

1\. For AAS BS architecture not equipped with connectors the NR BS EMC
approach for *BS type 1-O* and *BS type 2-O* shall be reused:

a\. EMC radiated emissions cannot be distinguished from the RF radiated
spurious emissions in the OTA test setup, therefore it becomes a single
emission requirement. This requirement is performed by measuring TRP
emissions at the enclosure of the DUT with the transmitters switched ON
and not terminated, radiating the output power subject to the antenna
array gain.

b\. The measurement is performed at the rated output power.

c\. The core requirement shall be captured in the BS RF specification TS
38.104 \[5\] under the OTA transmitter spurious emission requirement,
subject to radiated conformance test specification TS 38.141-2 \[6\].

d\. Emission limits shall be based on the ITU-R SM.329 \[7\]
recommendation.

2\. For non-AAS BS architecture equipped with antenna connectors the NR
BS EMC approach for *BS type 1-C* shall be reused.

NOTE: The above summary can be further updated once the decision on the
BS architecture will be taken for the 7 -- 24 GHz operation (e.g. in
case the non-AAS architecture will be excluded).

### 7.5.3 Immunity requirements

#### 7.5.3.1 Common EMC immunity requirements 

Irrespective of the BS architecture (i.e. non-AAS or AAS architecture)
considered for the NR operation in 7 -- 24 GHz frequency range, the
following EMC immunity requirements can be directly reused from the
existing NR BS specification TS 38.113 \[3\]:

\- Electrostatic discharge

\- Fast transients common mode

\- RF common mode (0.15 MHz - 80 MHz)

\- Voltage dips and interruptions

\- Surges, common and differential mode

The only EMC immunity requirement which has dependency on the NR BS
architecture is the radiated immunity requirement.

#### 7.5.3.2 Radiated immunity 

As of Rel-15 timeframe, the IEC 61000-4-3 \[8\] specification defines
the radiated immunity requirement up to 6 GHz. This frequency limit
would also apply to the EMC radiated immunity testing of the NR BS
operating in the 7 -- 24 GHz frequency range, until any future updates
to the IEC specification are released.

Based on the discussion on EMC radiated immunity requirements for the NR
BS with AAS BS architecture (i.e. no antenna connectors available), the
findings on solutions for the RF Rx chain protection from higher
radiated power levels in the OTA test chamber are considered to be also
applicable to the NR operation in the 7 -- 24 GHz frequency range. The
following alternative solutions are applicable to NR BS for the purposes
of the RF chain protection during the EMC radiated immunity testing:

\- Spatial exclusion zone, as described in TS 38.113 \[3\], clause 9.2,

\- Extended frequency exclusion, as described in TS 38.113 \[3\], clause
4.4.2.

######### Annex A (informative): Example filter characteristics

A.1 20 GHz example frequency filtering
======================================

A.1.1 General
-------------

The filter characteristics and needed guard for state-of-the art LTCC
technology and PCB integrated filter providing Q value around 200 and
120 respectively at 20 GHz is further investigated in this annex. It
should be noted that LTCC is more difficult to integrate than PCB
integrated filters.

Manufacturing tolerances and temperature drift will have a significant
impact on performance and must be accounted for by addition of a
sufficient design margin. It is assumed that individual tuning of
filters, which is done in many applications, is not feasible for array
antennas operating at 20 GHz due to the large amount, small size, and
compact integration into an array without test ports. A frequency
tolerance around 250 MHz is assumed (i.e. the frequency at which a
filter provides the desired suppression can differ from a nominal value
by maximum 250 MHz), which represents what is achievable for
state-of-the-art LTCC filters. PCB integrated filters will generally
need to allow for a worse frequency tolerance than LTCC filters. It is
for simplicity assumed that the frequency tolerance appears as a plain
frequency shift of the filter characteristic by +/-250 MHz for LTCC
filters in the worst case. This corresponds to a case in which all
resonators have the same frequency error. In general, though errors will
be uncorrelated to a certain degree and the tolerance may not be quite
as bad as this worst case.

Although the use of transmission zeros in general tends improve
steepness of a filter, the use of zeros has not been assumed in this
example since it increases the sensitivity to frequency errors and can
even lead to worse performance if the frequency tolerance is large
compared to the size of the guard band.

A.1.2 LTCC example filter
-------------------------

An equivalent model based on RLC-resonators was used to estimate the
performance of an LTCC filter. The filter is assumed to be tuned under
the following conditions:

\- Q = 200

\- 250 MHz margin to frequency shift

\- 6-poles, Chebyshev type

\- Center frequency: 20 GHz

\- Bandwidth: 2 GHz

\- Return loss: 15 dB

\- Attenuation: 25 dB

In figure A.1.1-1, the resulting filter performance is plotted. The blue
trace represents S21, the red trace represents S11, and the dotted gray
lines represent suggested requirement levels.

![](media/image58.emf){width="3.6969870953630797in"
height="2.0909087926509184in"}

Figure A.1.2-1: Estimated characteristics of a bandpass filter based on
LTCC for example frequency of 20 GHz

Considering a tolerance/drift-related frequency shift of +/-250 MHz for
LTCC filters, approximate estimates of the guard and insertion loss that
would need to be allowed for if the filter would be implemented and the
assumed amount of suppression would be required are:

-   Guard band: \~1.1 GHz

-   Insertion loss: \~3.5 dB (at edges, with worst case frequency error)

A.1.3 PCB integrated example filter
-----------------------------------

For PCB integrated filters due to lower achievable Q-values compared to
LTCC technology and worse frequency tolerance, the guard is expected to
be larger. Typical characteristics of such filters can be found by
looking at the following design example:

\- 5-pole, coupled line, strip-line filter

\- Permittivity: 3.4

\- Dielectric thickness: 500 μm (ground to ground)

\- Unloaded Q: 120 (using low loss microwave laminate/prepreg)

![](media/image59.png){width="3.779413823272091in"
height="0.925346675415573in"}

Figure A.1.3-1: Layout of a strip line filter in PCB technology

The filter is assumed to be tuned for 16 dB return loss in the nominal
case. Margins are added to make room for variations in the manufacturing
processes of the PCB according to the following assumptions:

\- Tolerance on permittivity: 1.5 % (min/max with uniform distribution).

\- Tolerance on line width: 20 μm (min/max with uniform distribution).

\- Tolerance on thickness of dielectric: 7 % (min/max with uniform
distribution).

The resulting filter performance is shown in figure A.1.2-2 for the
nominal case (without variations). Dashed pink lines represent suggested
requirement levels for a PCB-based filter. Note that for this type of
requirement it is necessary to relax the required attentuation to 20 dB,
compared to 25 dB for LTCC.

height="1.8280938320209974in"}

Figure A.1.3-2: Estimated S21 (left) and S11 (right) of a bandpass
filter based in PCB-technology

With the above assumptions about variations, a Monte-Carlo sweep with
250 iterations was conducted. Result are shown in figure A.1.3-3, in
which the dashed white trace corresponds to the nominal design and the
thin blue traces correspond to 250 randomly selected filters.

![](media/image61.png){width="2.966071741032371in"
height="1.8152143482064742in"}![](media/image62.png){width="2.889610673665792in"
height="1.8223818897637796in"}

Figure A.1.3-3: Estimated S21 representing transmission (left) and S11
representing return loss (right) of a bandpass filter based on
PCB-technology, taking fabrication tolerances into account

From this design example, estimates of key parameters for a PCB
implementation are as follows:

\- About 4 dB insertion loss at the band edge.

\- About 500 MHz frequency variation.

\- About 1.5-2 GHz guard band to get 20-25 dB suppression respectively.

\- Size: 25 mm^2^. This can be difficult to fit if there is one filter
per antenna element.

\- Return loss is relatively poor for many of the filters.

Several aspects were not considered in this analysis:

\- Temperature drift will lead to additional shift of the pass-band,
mainly through a change in the dielectric constant.

\- Some of the randomly picked filters will violate the suggested
requirement limits. The impact of this violation on the sum of unwanted
emissions from all branches (and filters) will depend on the exact
distribution of the set of filters used in a certain radio. For
simplicity it was assumed that there is no correlation between different
filters in a certain radio. This is an over-simplification in many
cases.

\- The use of transmission zeroes will improve steepness but may on the
other hand increase tolerance sensitivity.

\- Comparing to previously reported results for filters at 26.5 GHz
these results are similar. When comparing one should note that the ratio
between guard band and pass-band for the 26.5 GHz results is smaller in
the 20 GHz case, and that more than 20 dB is targeted at 20 GHz.

In summary, approximate estimates of key parameters are:

\- Guard band: \~1.5 - 2 GHz for 20 - 25 dB suppression

\- Insertion loss: \~4.0 dB (at edges, with worst case frequency error)

Given the analysis for 20 GHz example frequency, the filter performance
is quite similar to what was observed during NR Rel-15 for mm-wave
filter analysis.

A.2 15 GHz example frequency filtering
======================================

For 15 GHz example frequency considering the assumed attenuation
requirements of 30 dB, two example 6 pole LTCC filters with bandwidth of
1 GHz and 1.5 GHz respectively were analyzed, assuming a Q-value of 190,
and a tolerance/drift related frequency shift of 1 % (150 MHz). Two
transmission zeros were used in an attempt to minimize the guard band.
One should be aware that transmission zeroes tend to increase the
sensitivity to manufacturing errors and may require more margin for
tolerance/drift related frequency shift than what was assumed here.
Requiring a worst-case insertion loss of 3 dB (at the band edge for a
worst-case batch translation of the pass-band) the required guard band
is around 0.6 GHz in both cases. The filter response of the two example
filters is presented in figure A.2-1.

![](media/image63.png){width="2.952777777777778in"
height="2.3in"}![](media/image64.png){width="2.952777777777778in"
height="2.26875in"}

Figure A.2-1: Estimated characteristics of a bandpass filter based on
LTCC for example frequency of 15 GHz, 1.0 GHz bandwidth (left) and 1.5
GHz bandwidth (right)

As shown in figure A.2-1, the key characteristics for the two example
filters are as following:

\- Guard is \~0.6 GHz, and

\- Insertion losses are \~3 dB.

A.3 10 GHz example frequency filtering
======================================

For 10 GHz example frequency considering the assumed attenuation
requirements of 40 dB, several example filters were investigated with
Q-value of 150, 300 and 600, without considering any particular
technology. An attempt was first made to meet very sharp slopes to
handle a 0.2 GHz guard band, and achieve 2 dB insertion loss, and tested
filter with 8 poles and 2 transmission zeroes, with bandwidths of 0.6
GHz and 1 GHz. Figure A.3-1 shows the result of this investigation.
Different traces in the plots correspond to different Q-values. For 0.6
GHz bandwidth it would require a Q-value of 600, or actually 1000 to get
the insertion loss down to 2 dB, and a frequency tolerance better than
60 MHz. For 1 GHz bandwidth the result is similar, except that the mid
band insertion loss is somewhat lower, while the required tolerances are
even tighter. From this investigation it appears that it is not feasible
to have 0.2 GHz guard at 10 GHz with any established technology that is
suitable in array systems.

![](media/image65.png){width="2.984027777777778in"
height="2.2423611111111112in"}![](media/image66.png){width="2.9895833333333335in"
height="2.2423611111111112in"}

Figure A.3-1: Principle investigation of what it would take to achieve a
0.2 GHz guard band, indicating that it is not feasible, neither for 0.6
GHz bandwidth (left) nor for 1 GHz bandwidth (right)

As a next step the guard band was increased to 0.5 GHz, and look at 6
pole filter with 2 transmission zero with bandwidth of 1 GHz. This gives
the filter response shown in figure A.3-2. It is found that a frequency
tolerance better than 1 % (100 MHz) is required, and that the worst-case
insertion loss is close to 5 dB for a Q-value of 150 (the lowest blue
trace). This is roughly what could potentially be achieved with an LTCC
filter in best case. Note that the insertion loss does not meet the
goal. To get the worst-case insertion loss down to desired 2 dB one
would have to find an implementation that provides a Q-value better than
approximately 400, which is very challenging in array systems.

![](media/image67.png){width="2.9472222222222224in"
height="2.2423611111111112in"}

Figure A.3-2: Estimated characteristics of a LTCC filter with 1 GHz
bandwidth and 0.5 GHz guard band, for example frequency of 10 GHz

As a final step, filters with bandwidth increased to 2 GHz, still
assuming 0.5 GHz and attenuation of 40 dB, were investigated, one 6-pole
filter and one 8-pole filter. 2 transmission zeroes were used in both
cases. The filter characteristics are presented in figure A.3-3. The
6-pole filter requires a frequency tolerance of 50 MHz, and a Q-value
around 300 to get 2 dB insertion loss in worst case, while the 8-pole
filter requires a frequency tolerance of 1% (100 MHz), and the same
Q-value. According to these estimations, a LTCC filter could potentially
achieve roughly the performance for the 8-pole filter, for the case with
a Q of 150, and would give up to 4 dB insertion loss in worst case (at
edge of the band for the worst sample/batch of filters).

Figure A.3-3: Estimated characteristics of a 2 GHz bandpass filter based
on LTCC for example frequency of 10 GHz, 6-poles /zero (left) and 8-pole
/2 zero (right)

The above predictions would have to be verified in experiments,
considering the uncertainty regarding impact of manufacturing
tolerances, temperature drift, and insertion loss.

One should also note that the degradation in return loss that appears
due to tolerance errors was ignored, especially for uncorrelated errors.
This effect can be significant but is difficult to model in a general
and simple way. Additional margins in terms of guard band should be
considered to handle this.

To summarize, the following was observed:

\- A guard band of 0.2 GHz appears un-realistic for 10 GHz, for LTCC and
PCB-integrated stripline filters regardless of passband bandwidth, due
to the extreme requirements on frequency tolerance, and Q-value.

\- A guard band of 0.5 GHz is potentially feasible with a LTCC filter,
preferably with a relatively large bandwidth, around 1-2 GHz, in order
to keep insertion loss down below 4 dB close to the band edges.

Manufacturing tolerances and temperature drift will have a significant
impact on performance and must be accounted for by addition of
sufficient design margin.

In summary, the filter examples investigated, imply the need to have
sufficient guard-band taking to account the tolerances and drift in
frequency due to e.g. temperature etc.

######### Annex B (informative): Frequency ranges of interest in 7 -- 24 GHz 

In order to facilitate adequate and timely availability of the 7 - 24
GHz spectrum for IMT services with appropriate regulatory provisions,
the RAN-level discussion was initiated capturing number of requests from
operators. Three operators expressed their interest by providing
frequency ranges of interest, as captured in table B-1.

Additionally, MNO's provided their harmonized views in form of European
Telecommunications Network Operators (ETNO) and GSM Association (GSMA)
contributions as inputs to the CEPT ECC PT A meetings discussion on the
potential additional agenda items for the WRC-2023 conference.

Africa Telecommunication Union (ATU) provided Africa's common proposal
with the list of frequency ranges of interest for studies on
frequency-related matters for IMT identification including possible
additional allocations to the mobile services on a primary basis in
portions of the 7 -- 24 GHz frequency range for the future development
of IMT‑2020 and beyond.

For future reference, all the above mentioned requests within 7 -- 24
GHz range were listed in table B-1 and depicted on figure B-1 below.
