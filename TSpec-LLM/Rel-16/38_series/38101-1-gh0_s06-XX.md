6 Transmitter characteristics
=============================

6.1 General
-----------

Unless otherwise stated, the transmitter characteristics are specified
at the antenna connector of the UE with a single or multiple transmit
antenna(s). For UE with integral antenna only, a reference antenna with
a gain of 0 dBi is assumed.

Transmitter requirements for UL MIMO operation apply when the UE
transmits on 2 ports on the same CDM group. The UE may use higher MPR
values outside this limitation.

The applicability of transmitter requirements for Band n90 is in
accordance with that for Band n41; a UE supporting Band n90 shall meet
the minimum requirements for Band n41.

Unless otherwise stated, reference to power-class parameters in \[7\]
also applies to extended versions with value(s) in accordance with the
(extended) UE power class specified.

6.1A General
------------

The minimum requirements for band combinations including Band n41 also
apply for the corresponding band combinations with Band n90 replacing
Band n41 but with otherwise identical parameters. For brevity the said
band combinations with Band n90 are not listed in the tables below but
are covered by this specification.

6.1F General
------------

For wideband operations, the minimum requirements for the transmitter
characteristics are specified for transmissions on one scheduled RB set
or ≥ 1 scheduled contiguous RB set(s) within the UE channel. The
requirements apply with configured UL intra-cell guard bands of non-zero
size according to Table 5.3.3-2, with the union of the scheduled RB sets
and the intra-cell guard bands between the said RB sets scheduled and
available for transmission according to the channel access procedures in
\[14\].

6.2 Transmitter power
---------------------

### 6.2.1 UE maximum output power

The following UE Power Classes define the maximum output power for any
transmission bandwidth within the channel bandwidth of NR carrier unless
otherwise stated. The period of measurement shall be at least one sub
frame (1ms).

For UE power class 1.5 the maximum output power for single-port
transmission is defined as the sum of the maximum output power from both
UE antenna connectors. For PUSCH tranmissions, a UEs supporting PC1.5
shall meet the maximum output power requirement when scheduled by DCI
format 0\_0 or by DCI format 0\_1 configured for single antenna port.

If a UE supports a different power class than the default UE power class
for the band and the supported power class enables the higher maximum
output power than that of the default power class:

\- if the field of UE capability *maxUplinkDutyCycle-PC2-FR1* is absent
and the percentage of uplink symbols transmitted in a certain evaluation
period is larger than 50% (The exact evaluation period is no less than
one radio frame); or

\- if the field of UE capability *maxUplinkDutyCycle-PC2-FR1* is not
absent and the percentage of uplink symbols transmitted in a certain
evaluation period is larger than *maxUplinkDutyCycle-PC2-FR1* as defined
in TS 38.331 (The exact evaluation period is no less than one radio
frame); or

\- if the IE P-Max as defined in TS 38.331 \[7\] is provided and set to
the maximum output power of the default power class or lower;

\- shall apply all requirements for the default power class to the
supported power class and set the configured transmitted power as
specified in clause 6.2.4;

\- else if the UE does not support a power class with higher maximum
output power than PC2; or

\- if the field of UE capability *maxUplinkDutyCycle-PC2-FR1* is absent
and the percentage of uplink symbols transmitted in a certain evaluation
period is larger than 25% (The exact evaluation period is no less than
one radio frame); or

\- if the field of UE capability *maxUplinkDutyCycle-PC2-FR1* is not
absent and the percentage of uplink symbols transmitted in a certain
evaluation period is larger than 0.5\**maxUplinkDutyCycle-PC2-FR1*.(The
exact evaluation period is no less than one radio frame); or\
if the IE P-Max as defined in TS 38.331 \[7\] is provided and set to the
maximum output power of the power class 2 or lower;\
shall apply all requirements for power class 2 to the supported power
class and set the configured transmitted power as specified in clause
6.2.4;

\- else shall apply all requirements for the supported power class and
set the configured transmitted power as specified in clause 6.2.4.

### 6.2.2 UE maximum output power reduction

UE is allowed to reduce the maximum output power due to higher order
modulations and transmit bandwidth configurations. For UE power class
1.5, 2 and 3 and UE power class 1 in Band n14, the allowed maximum power
reduction (MPR) is defined in Table 6.2.2-4, Table 6.2.2-2, Table
6.2.2-1 and Table 6.2.2-5, respectively for channel bandwidths ≤ 100
MHz.

If the relative channel bandwidth ≤ 4% for TDD bands or ≤ 3% for FDD
bands, the ∆MPR is set to zero.

If the relative channel bandwidth \> 4% for TDD bands or \> 3% for FDD
bands, the ∆MPR is defined in Table 6.2.2-3.

Where relative channel bandwidth = 2\*BW~Channel~ / (F~UL\_low~ +
F~UL\_high~)

The allowed MPR for SRS, PUCCH formats 0, 1, 3 and 4, and PRACH shall be
as specified for QPSK modulated DFT-s-OFDM of equivalent RB allocation.
The allowed MPR for PUCCH format 2 shall be as specified for QPSK
modulated CP-OFDM of equivalent RB allocation.

Where the following parameters are defined to specify valid RB
allocation ranges for Outer and Inner RB allocations:

N~RB~ is the maximum number of RBs for a given Channel bandwidth and
sub-carrier spacing defined in Table 5.3.2-1. RB~Start,Low~ = max(1,
floor(L~CRB~/2))

where max() indicates the largest value of all arguments and floor(x) is
the greatest integer less than or equal to x.

RB~Start,High~ = N~RB~ -- RB~Start,Low~ -- L~CRB~

The RB allocation is an Inner RB allocation if the following conditions
are met

RB~Start,Low~ ≤ RB~Start~ ≤ RB~Start,High~, and

L~CRB~ ≤ ceil(N~RB~/2)

where ceil(x) is the smallest integer greater than or equal to x.

An Edge RB allocation is the one for which the RB(s) is (are) allocated
at the lowermost or uppermost edge of the channel with L~CRB~ ≤ 2 RBs.

The RB allocation is an Outer RB allocation for all other allocations
which are not an Inner RB allocation or Edge RB allocation.

If CP-OFDM allocation satisfies following conditions, it is considered
as almost contiguous allocation

N~RB\_gap~ / (N~RB\_alloc~ + N~RB\_gap~ ) ≤ 0.25

and N~RB\_alloc~ + N~RB\_gap~ is larger than 106, 51 or 24 RBs for 15
kHz, 30 kHz or 60 kHz respectively where N~RB\_gap~ is the total number
of unallocated RBs between allocated RBs and N~RB\_alloc~ is the total
number of allocated RBs. The size and location of allocated and
unallocated RBs are restricted by RBG parameters specified in clause
6.1.2.2 of TS 38.214 \[10\]. For UE that indicates support for
*almostContiguousCP-OFDM-UL*, the almost contiguous signals in power
class 2 and 3, the allowed maximum power reduction defined in Table
6.2.2-2 and Table 6.2.2-1 are increased by

CEIL{ 10 log~10~(1 + N~RB\_gap\ /~ N~RB\_alloc~), 0.5 } dB,

where CEIL{x,0.5} means x rounding upwards to closest 0.5dB. The
parameter of L~CRB~ which is used to specify valid RB allocation ranges
for Outer and Inner RB allocations is replaced by (N~RB\_alloc~ +
N~RB\_gap~) for almost contiguous allocation cases

For the UE maximum output power modified by MPR, the power limits
specified in clause 6.2.4 apply.

### 6.2.3 UE additional maximum output power reduction

#### 6.2.3.1 General

Additional emission requirements can be signalled by the network. Each
additional emission requirement is associated with a unique network
signalling (NS) value indicated in RRC signalling by an NR frequency
band number of the applicable operating band and an associated value in
the field *additionalSpectrumEmission.* Throughout this specification,
the notion of indication or signalling of an NS value refers to the
corresponding indication of an NR frequency band number of the
applicable operating band, the IE field *freqBandIndicatorNR* and an
associated value of *additionalSpectrumEmission* in the relevant RRC
information elements \[7\]*.*

To meet the additional requirements, additional maximum power reduction
(A-MPR) is allowed for the maximum output power as specified in Table
6.2.1-1. Unless stated otherwise, the total reduction to UE maximum
output power is max(MPR, A-MPR) where MPR is defined in clause 6.2.2.
Outer and inner allocation notation used in clause 6.2.3 is defined in
clause 6.2.2. Unless stated otherwise, Edge RB allocations get the same
AMPR as Outer RB allocations. In absence of modulation and waveform
types the A-MPR applies to all modulation and waveform types.

Table 6.2.3.1-1 specifies the additional requirements with their
associated network signalling values and the allowed A-MPR and
applicable operating band(s) for each NS value. In case of a power class
3 UE, when IE *powerBoostPi2BPSK* is set to 1, power class 2 A-MPR
values apply. The mapping of NR frequency band numbers and values of the
*additionalSpectrumEmission* to network signalling labels is specified
in Table 6.2.3.1-1A.

For almost contiguous allocations in CP-OFDM waveforms in power class 3,
the allowed A-MPR defined in clause 6.2.3 is increased by CEIL{10
log~10~(1 + N~RB\_gap\ /~ N~RB\_alloc~), 0.5} dB, where CEIL{x, 0.5}
means x rounding upwards to closest 0.5dB, N~RB\_gap~ is the total
number of unallocated RBs between allocated RBs and N~RB\_alloc~ is the
total number of allocated RBs, and the parameter L~CRB~ is replaced by
N~RB\_alloc~ + N~RB\_gap~ in specifying the RB allocation regions.

Unless otherwise specified, pi/2 BPSK in following A-MPR tables refers
to both variants of pi/2 BPSK referenced in 6.2.2 tables 6.2.2-1.

#### 6.2.3.2 A-MPR for NS\_04

For NS\_04, A-MPR is not added to MPR. Also, when NS\_04 is signalled,
MPR shall be set to zero in the P~CMAX~ equations to avoid double
counting MPR.

Allowed maximum power reduction is defined as A-MPR = max(MPR, A-MPR\'),

Note that A-MPR\' = 0 dB means only MPR is applied,

where A-MPR\' is defined as

if RB~start~ ≤ f~start,max,IMD3~ / (12⋅SCS) and L~CRB~ ≤ AW~max,IMD3~ /
(12⋅SCS) and F~C~ - BW~Channel~/2 \< F~UL\_low~ + offset~IMD3~,\
then

the A-MPR\' is defined according to Table 6.2.3.2-2 PC3\_A2 relative to
23 dBm for power class 3, PC2\_A4 relative to 26 dBm for power class 2,
and PC1.5\_A6 relative to 29 dBm for power class 1.5,

else,

if RB~start~ ≤ L~CRB~/2 + ∆~start~ / (12⋅SCS) and L~CRB~ ≤
AW~max,regrowth~ / (12⋅SCS) and F~C~ - BW~Channel~/2 \< F~UL\_low~ +
offset~regrowth~,\
then

the A-MPR\' is defined according to Table 6.2.3.2-2 PC3\_A1 relative to
23 dBm for power class 3, PC2\_A3 relative to 26 dBm for power class 2,
, and PC1.5\_A5 relative to 29 dBm for power class 1.5,

else

A-MPR\' = 0 dB and apply MPR.

With the parameters defined in Table 6.2.3.2-1.

### 6.2.4 Configured transmitted power

The UE is allowed to set its configured maximum output power P~CMAX,f,c~
for carrier f of serving cell c in each slot. The configured maximum
output power P~CMAX,f,c~ is set within the following bounds:

P~CMAX\_L,f,c~ ≤ P~CMAX,f,c~ ≤ P~CMAX\_H,f,c~ with

P~CMAX\_L,f,c~ = MIN {P~EMAX,c~-- ∆T~C,c~, (P~PowerClass~ --
ΔP~PowerClass~) -- MAX(MAX(MPR~c~+∆MPR~c~, A-MPR~c~)+ ΔT~IB,c~ + ∆T~C,c~
+ ∆T~RxSRS~, P-MPR~c~) }

P~CMAX\_H,f,c~ = MIN {P~EMAX,c~, P~PowerClass~ -- ΔP~PowerClass~ }

where

P~EMAX,c~ is the value given by either the *p-Max* IE or the field
*additionalPmax* of the *NR-NS-PmaxList IE*, whichever is applicable
according to TS 38.331\[7\];

P~PowerClass~ is the maximum UE power specified in Table 6.2.1-1 without
taking into account the tolerance specified in the Table 6.2.1-1;

When the IE *powerBoostPi2BPSK* is set to 1, P~EMAX,c~ is increased by
+3 dB for a power class 3 capable UE operating in TDD bands n40, n41,
n77, n78, and n79 with PI/2 BPSK modulation and UE indicates support for
UE capability *powerBoosting-pi2BPSK* and 40% or less symbols in certain
evaluation period are used for UL transmission when P~EMAX,c~ ≥ 20 dBm
(The exact evaluation period is no less than one radio frame).

When the IE *powerBoostPi2BPSK* is set to 1, ΔP~PowerClass~ = -3 dB for
a power class 3 capable UE operating in TDD bands n40, n41, n77, n78,
and n79 with Pi/2 BPSK modulation and UE indicates support for UE
capability *powerBoosting-pi2BPSK* and 40% or less slots in radio frame
are used for UL transmission.

ΔP~PowerClass~ = 3 dB for a power class 2 capable UE or 6 dB for a power
class 1.5 UE when P-max of 23 dBm or lower is indicated; or when the
field of UE capability *maxUplinkDutyCycle-PC2-FR1* is absent and the
percentage of uplink symbols transmitted in a certain evaluation period
is larger than 50%; or when the field of UE capability
*maxUplinkDutyCycle-PC2-FR1* is not absent and the percentage of uplink
symbols transmitted in a certain evaluation period is larger than
*maxUplinkDutyCycle-PC2-FR1* as defined in TS 38.331 (The exact
evaluation period is no less than one radio frame); 3 dB for a power
class 1.5 capable UE when P-max of between 23 dBm and 26 dB is
indicated; or when the field of UE capability
*maxUplinkDutyCycle-PC2-FR1* is absent and the percentage of uplink
symbols transmitted in a certain evaluation period is between 25% and
50%; or when the field of UE capability *maxUplinkDutyCycle-PC2-FR1* is
not absent and the percentage of uplink symbols transmitted in a certain
evaluation period is between *maxUplinkDutyCycle-PC2-FR1* and
*maxUplinkDutyCycle-PC2-FR1/2* as defined in TS 38.331 (The exact
evaluation period is no less than one radio frame); otherwise
ΔP~PowerClass~ = 0 dB;

∆T~IB,c~ is the additional tolerance for serving cell c as specified in
clause 6.2A.4.2 for NR CA, clause 6.2C.2 for SUL, or TS 38.101-3 clause
6.2B.4.2 for EN-DC; ∆T~IB,c~ = 0 dB otherwise; In case the UE supports
more than one of band combinations for V2X operating bands for
concurrent operation, CA, SUL or DC, and an operating band belongs to
more than one band combinations then

a\) When the operating band frequency range is ≤ 1 GHz, the applicable
additional ∆T~IB,c~ shall be the average value for all band combinations
defined in clause 6.2A.4.2, 6.2C.2 in this specification and 6.2B.4.2 in
TS 38.101-3 \[3\], truncated to one decimal place that apply for that
operating band among the supported band combinations. In case there is a
harmonic relation between low band UL and high band DL, then the maximum
∆T~IB,c~ among the different supported band combinations involving such
band shall be applied

b\) When the operating band frequency range is \> 1 GHz, the applicable
additional ∆T~IB,c~ shall be the maximum value for all band combinations
defined in clause 6.2A.4.2, 6.2C.2 in this specification and 6.2B.4.2 in
TS 38.101-3 \[3\] for the applicable operating bands.

∆T~C,c~ = 1.5dB when NOTE 3 in Table 6.2.1-1 in 38.101-1 applies for a
serving cell c, otherwise ∆T~C,c~ = 0 dB ;

MPR~c~ and A-MPR~c~ for serving cell c are specified in clause 6.2.2 and
clause 6.2.3, respectively;

∆MPR~c~ for serving cell c is specified in clause 6.2.2.

∆T~RxSRS~ is applied during SRS transmission occasions with *usage* in
*SRS-ResourceSet* set as 'antennaSwitching' when

when

a\) UE transmits SRS on the second SRS resource in every configured SRS
resource set when the *SRS-TxSwitch* capability is indicated as \'t1r2\'

b\) UE transmits SRS on the second, third and fourth SRS resources of
the total 4 SRS resources from all configured SRS resource set(s)
consisting of one SRS port when the *SRS-TxSwitch* capability is
indicated as \'t1r4\' or, \'t1r4-t2r4\' but in 't1r4' mode.

c\) UE transmits SRS from the second SRS port pair on the second SRS
resource in every configured SRS resource set consisting of two SRS
ports when the *SRS-TxSwitch* capability is indicated as \'t2r4\' or
\'t1r4-t2r4\' but in 't2r4' mode, or

d\) UE transmits SRS to a DL-only carrier

The value of ∆T~RxSRS~ is 4.5dB for bands whose F~UL\_high~ is higher
than the F~UL\_low~ of n79 and 3 dB for bands whose F~UL\_high~ is lower
than the F~UL\_low~ of n79 when the device is capable of power class 3
or power class 5 in the band, or when the device is capable of power
class 2 in the band and ΔP~PowerClass~ = 3 dB. The value of ∆T~RxSRS~ is
7.5dB for bands whose F~UL\_high~ is higher than the F~UL\_low~ of n79
and 6 dB for bands whose F~UL\_high~ is lower than the F~UL\_low~ of n79
when the device is capable of power class 2 in the band and
ΔP~PowerClass~ = 0 dB.

For other SRS transmissions ∆T~RxSRS~ is zero;

P-MPR~c~ is the power management maximum power reduction for

a\) ensuring compliance with applicable electromagnetic energy
absorption requirements and addressing unwanted emissions / self desense
requirements in case of simultaneous transmissions on multiple RAT(s)
for scenarios not in scope of 3GPP RAN specifications;

b\) ensuring compliance with applicable electromagnetic energy
absorption requirements in case of proximity detection is used to
address such requirements that require a lower maximum output power.

The UE shall apply P-MPR~c~ for serving cell c only for the above cases.
For UE conducted conformance testing P-MPR~c~ shall be 0 dB

> NOTE 1: P-MPRc was introduced in the P~CMAX,f,c~ equation such that
> the UE can report to the gNB the available maximum output transmit
> power. This information can be used by the gNB for scheduling
> decisions.
>
> NOTE 2: P-MPRc may impact the maximum uplink performance for the
> selected UL transmission path.

T~REF~ and T~eval~ are specified in Table 6.2.4-1. For each T~REF~, the
P~CMAX,L,c~ for serving cell c are evaluated per T~eval~ and given by
the minimum value taken over the transmission(s) within the T~eval~; the
minimum P~CMAX\_L,f,c~ over one or more T~eval~ is then applied for the
entire T~REF.~

  Physical channel length   Physical channel length   Min(*T~no\_hopping~*, Physical Channel Length)

The measured configured maximum output power P~UMAX,f,c~ shall be within
the following bounds:

P~CMAX\_L,f,c~ -- MAX{T~L,c~, T(P~CMAX\_L,f,c~)} ≤ P~UMAX,f,c~ ≤
P~CMAX\_H,f,c~ + T(P~CMAX\_H,f,c~).

where the tolerance T(P~CMAX,f,c~) for applicable values of P~CMAX,f,c~
is specified in Table 6.2.4-1. The tolerance T~L,c~ is the absolute
value of the lower tolerance for the applicable operating band as
specified in Table 6.2.1-1.

#### 6.2A.1.3 UE maximum output power for Inter-band CA

For inter-band downlink carrier aggregation with one uplink carrier
assigned to one NR band, the transmitter power requirements in clause
6.2 apply.

For inter-band carrier aggregation with two uplink contiguous carrier
assigned to one NR band, the transmitter power requirements specified in
subclause 6.2A.1.1 apply.

For inter-band uplink carrier aggregation with uplink assigned to two NR
bands, UE maximum output power shall be measured over all component
carriers from different bands. If each band has separate antenna
connectors, maximum output power is defined as the sum of maximum output
power from each UE antenna connector. The period of measurement shall be
at least one sub frame (1 ms). The maximum output power is specified in
Table 6.2A.1.3-1.

For PC3 inter-band carrier aggregation with one uplink component carrier
assigned to one NR band in NR band n41, n77, n78, and n79, the
requirements for power class 2 are not applicable and the corresponding
requirements for a power class 3 UE shall apply.

### 6.2A.2 UE maximum output power reduction for CA

#### 6.2A.2.1 UE maximum output power reduction for Intra-band contiguous CA

For intra-band contiguous carrier aggregation the allowed Maximum Power
Reduction (MPR) for the maximum output power in Table 6.2A.1.1-1 with
contiguous RB allocation is specified in Table 6.2A.2.1-1 for UE power
class 3 CA bandwidth classes B and C.

In case the modulation format or waveform type is different on different
component carriers then the requirement is set by rules applied to the
waveform type (DFT-s-OFDM or CP-OFDM) and modulation order used in the
configuration with the largest MPR..

Unless otherwise specified, pi/2 BPSK in following MPR tables refers to
both variants of pi/2 BPSK referenced in 6.2.2 tables 6.2.2-1.

For CA bandwidth class B and bandwidth class C with contiguous RB
allocation, the following parameters are defined to specify valid RB
allocation ranges for Inner and Outer RB allocations:

An RB allocation is contiguous if L~CRB1~ = 0 or L~CRB2~ = 0 or (L~CRB1~
≠ 0 and L~CRB2~  ≠ 0 and RB~Start1~ + L~CRB1~ = N~RB1~ and RB~Start2~ =
0), where RB~Start1~, L~CRB1~, and N~RB1~ are for CC1, RB~Start2~,
L~CRB2~, and N~RB2~ are for CC2, CC1 is the component carrier with lower
frequency.

In contiguous CA, a contiguous allocation is an inner allocation if

RB~Start,Low~ ≤ RB~Start\_CA~ ≤ RB~Start,High~, and N~RB\_alloc~ ≤
ceil(N~RB,agg~ /2),

where

RB~Start,Low~ = max(1, floor(N~RB\_alloc~ /2))

RB~Start,High~ = N~RB,agg~ -- RB~Start,Low~ -- N~RB,alloc~,

with

N~RB\_alloc~= L~CRB1~ ∙ 2\^µ~1~ + L~CRB2~ ∙ 2\^µ~2~,

N~RB,agg~=N~RB1~∙2\^µ~1~+ N~RB2~∙2\^µ~2~.

If L~CRB1~ =0, RB~Start\_CA~ = N~RB1~∙2\^µ~1~+ RB~Start2~∙2\^µ~2~,

if L~CRB1~ \> 0, RB~Start\_CA~ = RB~Start1~∙2\^µ~1~.

A contiguous allocation that is not an Inner contiguous allocation is an
Outer contiguous allocation.

For intra-band contiguous carrier aggregation the allowed Maximum Power
Reduction (MPR) for the maximum output power in Table 6.2A.1.1-1 with
non-contiguous RB allocation is specified in Table 6.2A.2.1-2 for UE
power class 3 CA bandwidth classes B and C.

For CA bandwidth classes B and C with non-contiguous RB allocation, the
following parameters are defined to specify valid RB allocation ranges
for Inner, Outer1 and Outer2 RB allocations:

Non-Contiguous RB allocation is defined as RB~Start1~ + L~CRB1~ \<
N~RB1~, or RB~Start2~ \> 0, when both uplink CCs are activated and
allocated with RB(s), where RB~Start1~, L~CRB1~, and N~RB1~ are for CC1,
RB~Start2~, L~CRB2~, and N~RB2~ are for CC2, CC1 is the component
carrier with lower frequency.

In contiguous CA, a non-contiguous RB allocation is a non-contiguous
Inner RB allocation if the following conditions are met:

RB~Start,Low~ ≤ RB~Start\_CA~ ≤ RB~Start,High~ and N~RB\_alloc~ ≤
ceil((BW~Channel\_CA~ / 3 -- BW~gap~ ) / 0.18MHz),

where

N~RB\_alloc~ = (N~RB1~ - RB~Start1~)∙ 2\^µ~1~ + (RB~Start2~ + L~CRB2~ )
∙ 2\^µ~2,~

RB~Start\_CA~ = RB~Start1~∙2\^μ~1~

RB~Start,Low~ = max(1, floor(N~RB\_alloc~ + (BW~gap~ --
BW~GB,low~)/0.18MHz))

RB~Start,High~ = floor((BW~Channel\_CA~ -- 2 ∙ BW~gap~ --
BW~GB,low~)/0.18MHz -- 2 ∙ N~RB\_alloc~)

BW~GB,low~ =F~offset,low~ -- (N~RB1~∙12+1)∙SCS~1~/2

BW~gap~ is the bandwidth of the gap between N~RB1~ and N~RB2~ possible
allocations of CC1 and CC2 respectively.

In contiguous CA, a non-contiguous RB allocation is a non-contiguous
outer 1 RB allocation if the following conditions are met:

RB~Start,Low~ ≤ RB~Start\_CA~ ≤ RB~Start,High~ and N~RB\_alloc~ ≤
ceil((3 BW~Channel\_CA~ / 5 -- BW~gap~) / 0.18MHz)

where

RB~Start,Low~ = max(1, 2 ∙ N~RB\_alloc~ -- floor( (BW~Channel\_CA~ -- 2
∙ BW~gap~ + BW~GB,low~)/0.18MHz)),

RB~Start,High~ = floor((2 ∙ BW~Channel\_CA~ -- 3 ∙ BW~gap~ --
BW~GB,low~) / 0.18MHz -- 3 ∙ N~RB\_alloc~)

N~RB\_alloc\ ,~ RB~Start\_CA\ ,~ BW~gap~ and BW~GB,low~ are as defined
for the Inner region.

In contiguous CA, a non-contiguous allocation is an Outer 2 allocation
if it is neither a non-contiguous Inner allocation nor an Outer 1
allocation.

#### 6.2A.2.2 UE maximum output power reduction for Intra-band non-contiguous CA

##### 6.2A.2.2.0 General

For intra-band non-contiguous CA, the allowed Maximum Power Reduction
(MPR) for the maximum output power is specified into 2 types: MPR to
meet -30dBm/MHz and -13dBm/MHz. The UE determins the MPR type as
follows:

> If OR( L~CRB1~ = 0, L~CRB2~ = 0 )
>
> MPR defined in Table 6.2.2-1 for PC3
>
> Else If AND( F~IM3,low\_block,low~ \> SEM~-13,low\ ,~
> F~IM3,high\_block,high~ \< SEM~-13,high~ )
>
> MPR defined in Clause 6.2A.2.2.2
>
> Else
>
> MPR defined in Clause 6.2A.2.2.1

where

\- L~CRB1~ is for CC1 which is the component carrier with lower
frequency

\- L~CRB2~ is for CC2 which is the component carrier with higher
frequency

\- B = (L~CRB1~\* 12\* SCS~1~ + L~CRB2~ \* 12 \* SCS~2~)/1,000

\- F~IM3,high\_block,high~ = (2 \* F~high\_alloc,high\_edge~ ) --
F~low\_alloc,low\_edge~

\- F~IM3,low\_block,low~ = (2 \* F~low\_alloc,low\_edge~) --
F~high\_alloc,high\_edge~

\- F~low\_alloc,low\_edge~ is the lowermost frequency of the lower
transmission bandwidth allocation.

\- F~low\_alloc,high\_edge~ is the uppermost frequency of the lower
transmission bandwidth allocation.

\- F~high\_alloc,low\_edge~ is the lowermost frequency of the upper
transmission bandwidth allocation.

\- F~high\_alloc,high\_edge~ is the uppermost frequency of the upper
transmission bandwidth allocation.

\- SEM~-13,low~ = Threshold frequency where lower spectral emission mask
below the lower channel drops from -13 dBm / MHz to -25 dBm / MHz, as
specified in Clause 6.5A.2.2.2.

\- SEM~-13,high~ = Threshold frequency where upper spectral emission
mask above the upper channel drops from -13 dBm / MHz to -25 dBm / MHz,
as specified in Clause 6.5A.2.2.2.

#### 6.2A.2.3 UE maximum output power reduction for Inter-band CA

For inter-band carrier aggregation with one uplink carrier assigned to
one NR band, the requirements in subclause 6.2.2 apply.

For inter-band carrier aggregation with two uplink contiguous carrier
assigned to one NR band, the maximum output power reduction requirements
for intra-band contiguous carrier aggregation in subclause 6.2A.2.1
apply for that band.

For inter-band carrier aggregation with uplink assigned to two NR bands,
the requirements in clause 6.2.2 apply for each uplink component
carrier.

### 6.2A.3 UE additional maximum output power reduction for CA

#### 6.2A.3.1.1 UE additional maximum output power reduction for Intra-band contiguous CA

Additional emission requirements can be signalled by the network. Each
additional emission requirement is associated with a unique network
signalling (NS) value indicated in RRC signalling by an NR frequency
band number of the applicable operating band and an associated value in
the field *additionalSpectrumEmission.* Throughout this specification,
the notion of indication or signalling of an NS value refers to the
corresponding indication of an NR frequency band number of the
applicable operating band, the IE field *freqBandIndicatorNR* and an
associated value of *additionalSpectrumEmission* in the relevant RRC
information elements \[7\]*.* Relation between NR CA band and NR
frequency band is specified in Table 5.2A.1-1.

To meet the additional requirements, additional maximum power reduction
(A-MPR) is allowed for the maximum output power as specified in Table
6.2A.1.1-1. Unless stated otherwise, the total reduction to UE maximum
output power is max(MPR, A-MPR) where MPR is defined in clause 6.2A.2.1.
In absense of modulation and waveform types the A-MPR applies to all
modulation and waveform types.

Table 6.2A.3.1.1-1 specifies the additional requirements with their
associated network signalling values and the allowed A-MPR and
applicable CA band(s) for each CA\_NS value. The CA\_NS\_xy value
indicates the additional unwanted emissions requirements that apply for
intra-band contiguous CA bands with NS\_xy indicated or configured in
multiple uplink serving cells, except CA\_NS\_01 that indicates the
general emission requirements for intra-band contiguous CA bands. The
mapping of NR CA band numbers and values of the
*additionalSpectrumEmission* to network signalling labels is specified
in Table 6.2A.3.1.1-2. For any NR CA band not listed in Table
6.2A.3.1.1-2 the network signalling label CA\_NS\_01 applies.

##### 6.2A.3.1.2 UE additional maximum output power reduction for Intra-band non-contiguous CA

##### 6.2A.3.1.2.0 General {#a.3.1.2.0-general .H6}

Table 6.2A.3.1.2-1 specifies the additional requirements with their
associated network signalling values and the allowed A-MPR and
applicable CA band(s) for each CA\_NC\_NS value. The CA\_NC\_NS\_xy
value indicates the additional unwanted emissions requirements that
apply for intra-band non-contiguous CA bands with NS\_xy indicated or
configured in multiple uplink serving cells, except CA\_NC\_NS\_01 that
indicates the general emission requirements for intra-band
non-contiguous CA bands. The mapping of NR CA band numbers and values of
the *additionalSpectrumEmission* to network signalling labels is
specified in Table 6.2A.3.1.2-2. For any NR CA band not listed in Table
6.2A.3.1.2-2 the network signalling label CA\_NC\_NS\_01 applies.

##### 6.2A.3.1.2.1 AMPR for CA\_NC\_NS\_04 (CA\_n41(2A)) {#a.3.1.2.1-ampr-for-ca_nc_ns_04-ca_n412a .H6}

For intra-band non-contiguous CA\_n41(2A) and it receives IE
CA\_NC\_NS\_04, the UE determins the allowed Additional Maximum Power
Reduction (AMPR) for the maximum output power as specified in this
clause. The AMPR is specified into 2 types: AMPR to meet -25dBm/MHz and
-13dBm/MHz. The A-MPR defined in this clause is used instead of MPR
defined in 6.2A.2.2, not additively, so CA MPR=0 when CA\_NC\_NS\_04 is
signaled.

The UE determins the AMPR type as follows:

> If AND( MIN(F~IM3,low\_block,high~, SEM~-13,low~) \< F~filter,low\ ,~
> MAX( SEM~-13,high~, F~IM3,high\_block,low~ ) \> F~filter,high~ )

>
> Else
>
> A-MPR~IM3~ defined in Clause 6.2A.3.1.2.1.1

where

\- L~CRB1~ is for CC1 which is the component carrier with lower
frequency

\- L~CRB2~ is for CC2 which is the component carrier with higher
frequency

\- B = (L~CRB1~\* 12\* SCS~1~ + L~CRB2~ \* 12 \* SCS~2~)/1,000

\- F~IM3,low\_block,high~ = (2 \* F~low\_alloc,high\_edge~ ) --
F~high\_alloc,low\_edge~

\- F~IM3,high\_block,low~ = (2 \* F~high\_alloc,low\_edge~) --
F~low\_alloc,high\_edge~

\- F~low\_alloc,low\_edge~ is the lowermost frequency of lower
transmission bandwidth allocation.

\- F~low\_alloc,high\_edge~ is the uppermost frequency of lower
transmission bandwidth allocation.

\- F~high\_alloc,low\_edge~ is the lowermost frequency of upper
transmission bandwidth allocation.

\- F~high\_alloc,high\_edge~ is the uppermost frequency of upper
transmission bandwidth allocation.

\- F~filter,low~ = 2480 MHz

\- F~filter,high~ = 2745 MHz

\- SEM~-13,high~ = Threshold frequency where upper spectral emission
mask for upper channel drops from -13 dBm / 1MHz to -25 dBm / 1MHz, as
specified in Clause 6.5A.2.3.2.

\- SEM~-13,low~ = Threshold frequency where lower spectral emission mask
below the lower channel drops from -13 dBm / MHz to -25 dBm / MHz, as
specified in Clause 6.5A.2.3.2.

##### 6.2A.3.1.2.1.1 AMPR~IM3~ to meet -25dBm/MHz {#a.3.1.2.1.1-amprim3-to-meet--25dbmmhz .H6}

AMPR in this clause is for intra-band non-contiguous CA\_n41(2A) power
class 3 for UEs indicating IE *dualPA-Architecture* supported. The
allowed maximum output power reduction is defined as:

AMPR~IM3~=M~A~Where M~A~ is defined as follows

M~A~ = 12; 0 ≤ B \< 1.08

12; 1.08 ≤ B \< 2.16

AMPR in this clause is for intra-band non-contiguous CA\_n41(2A) power
class 3 for UEs indicating IE *dualPA-Architecture* supported. The
allowed maximum output power reduction is defined as:

AMPR~IM3~=M~A~

Where M~A~ is defined as follows

##### 6.2A.3.1.3 UE additional maximum output power reduction for Inter-band CA

Unless otherwise stated, for inter-band carrier aggregation with one
uplink carrier assigned to one NR band, the requirements in subclause
6.2.3 apply.

Unless otherwise stated, for inter-band carrier aggregation with two
uplink contiguous carrier assigned to one NR band, the additional
maximum output power reduction requirements for intra-band contiguous
carrier aggregation in subclause 6.2A.3.1.1 apply for that band.

Unless specified in Table 6.2A.3.1.3-1, for inter-band carrier
aggregation with uplink assigned to two NR bands, the requirements in
clause 6.2.3 apply only to the indicated carrier. The requirements in
Table 6.2A.3.1.3-1 are specified in terms of an additional spectrum
emission requirement with their associated network signalling values and
the allowed A-MPR. Unless otherwise stated, the combined requirements
and allowed A-MPR are applicable on both bands when both component
carriers are active. Additional spurious emission requirements are
signalled by the network to indicate that the UE shall meet the
additional requirement for a specific deployment scenario as part of the
cell handover/broadcast message.

To meet the additional requirements, additional maximum power reduction
(A-MPR) is allowed for the maximum output power as specified in Table
6.2.1-1. Unless stated otherwise, the total reduction to UE maximum
output power is max(MPR, A-MPR) where MPR is defined in clause 6.2.2. In
case of a power class 3 UE, when IE powerBoostPi2BPSK is set to 1, power
class 2 A-MPR values apply.

For almost contiguous allocations in CP-OFDM waveforms in power class 3,
the allowed A-MPR defined in clause 6.2.3 is increased by CEIL{ 10
log10(1 + NRB\_gap / NRB\_alloc), 0.5 } dB, where NRB\_gap is the total
number of unallocated RBs between allocated RBs and NRB\_alloc is the
total number of allocated RBs, and the parameter LCRB is replaced by
NRB\_alloc + NRB\_gap in specifying the RB allocation regions.

Unless otherwise specified, pi/2 BPSK in following A-MPR tables refers
to both variants of pi/2 BPSK referenced in 6.2.2 tables 6.2.2-1.

The emission requirements specified in Table 6.2A.3.1.3-1 also apply for
the frequency ranges that are less than F~OOB~ (MHz) in Table 6.5.3.1-1
from the edge of the channel bandwidth.

### 6.2A.4 Configured output power for CA

#### 6.2A.4.1 Configured transmitted power level

##### 6.2A.4.1.1 Configured transmitted power for Intra-band contiguous CA

For uplink carrier aggregation the UE is allowed to set its configured
maximum output power P~CMAX,*c*~ for serving cell *c* and its total
configured maximum output power P~CMAX~.

The configured maximum output power P~CMAX,*c*~ on serving cell *c*
shall be set as specified in clause 6.2.4, but with MPR*~c~* = MPR and
A-MPR*~c~* = A-MPR with MPR and A-MPR as determined by subclause 6.2A.2
and 6.2A.3, respectively. For PH reporting the following exception
applies: if the UE is configured with multiple uplink serving cells, the
power P~CMAX,*c*~ used for the purpose of PH reporting on first serving
cell *c* = *c~1~* does not consider for computation of the PH report
transmissions on a second serving cell *c~2~* as exempted in subclause
7.7.1 in \[8\]. There is one power management term for the UE, denoted
P-MPR, and P-MPR *~c~* = P-MPR.

The total configured maximum output power P~CMAX~ shall be set within
the following bounds:

P~CMAX\_L~ ≤ P~CMAX~ ≤ P~CMAX\_H~

For uplink intra-band contiguous carrier aggregation when same slot
pattern is used in all aggregated serving cells,

P~CMAX\_L~ = MIN{10 log~10~ ∑ p~EMAX,c~ - ∆T~C~ ,
P~EMAX,CA~,P~PowerClass,CA~ -- MAX(MAX(MPR, A-MPR) + ΔT~IB,c~ + ∆T~C~ +
∆T~RxSRS~, P-MPR~c~ ) }

P~CMAX\_H~ = MIN{10 log~10~ ∑ p~EMAX,c~ , P~EMAX,CA~ ,P~PowerClass,CA~}

where

\- p~EMAX,c~ is the linear value of P~EMAX,*c*~ which is given by IE
*P-Max* for serving cell *c* in \[7\];

\- P~PowerClass,CA~ is the maximum UE power specified in Table
6.2A.1.1-1 without taking into account the tolerance;

\- MPR and A-MPR are specified in clause 6.2A.2 and 6.2A.3,
respectively;

\- ∆*T~IB,c~* is the additional tolerance for serving cell *c* as
specified in clause 6.2A.4.2 for NR CA, clause 6.2C.2 for SUL, or TS
38.101-3 clause 6.2B.4.2 for EN-DC; In case the UE supports more than
one of band combinations for CA, SUL or DC, and an operating band
belongs to more than one band combinations then

a\) When the operating band frequency range is ≤ 1 GHz, the applicable
additional ∆T~IB,c~ shall be the average value for all band combinations
defined in clause 6.2A.4.2, 6.2C.2 in this specification and 6.2B.4.2 in
TS 38.101-3 \[3\], truncated to one decimal place that apply for that
operating band among the supported band combinations. In case there is a
harmonic relation between low band UL and high band DL, then the maximum
∆T~IB,c~ among the different supported band combinations involving such
band shall be applied

b\) When the operating band frequency range is \> 1 GHz, the applicable
additional ∆T~IB,c~ shall be the maximum value for all band combinations
defined in clause 6.2A.4.2, 6.2C.2 in this specification and 6.2B.4.2 in
TS 38.101-3 \[3\] for the applicable operating bands.

\- P-MPR is the power management term for the UE;

\- ∆T~C~ is the highest value ∆T~C,c~ among all serving cells *c*;

\- ∆T~RxSRS~ is the highest value among all serving cells *c;*

\- P~EMAX,CA~ is the value indicated by *p-NR-FR1* or by *p-UE-FR1*
whichever is the smallest if both are present.

For uplink intra-band contiguous carrier aggregation, when at least one
different numerology/slot pattern is used in aggregated cells, the UE is
allowed to set its configured maximum output power P~CMAX,c(i),i~ for
serving cell c(i) of slot numerology type *i*, and its total configured
maximum output power P~CMAX~.

The configured maximum output power P~CMAX,c(i),i~ (p) in slot p of
serving cell c(i) on slot numerology type *i* shall be set within the
following bounds:

P~CMAX\_L,f,c(i),i~ (p) ≤ P~CMAX,f,c(i),\ i~ (p) ≤ P~CMAX\_H,f,c(i),i~
(p)

where P~CMAX\_L,f,c~ ~(i),i~ (p) and P~CMAX\_H,f,c(i),i~ (p) are the
limits for a serving cell c(i) of slot numerology type i as specified in
clause 6.2.4.

The total UE configured maximum output power P~CMAX~ (p,q) in a slot p
of slot numerology or symbol pattern *i*, and a slot q of slot
numerology or symbol pattern *j* that overlap in time shall be set
within the following bounds unless stated otherwise:

P~CMAX\_L~(p,q) ≤ P~CMAX~ (p,q) ≤ P~CMAX\_H~ (p,q)

When slots p and q have different transmissions lengths and belong to
different cells on different or same bands:

P~CMAX\_L~ (p,q) = MIN {10 log~10~ \[p~CMAX\_L,f,c(i),i~ (p) +
p~CMAX\_L,f,c(i),j~ (q)\], P~PowerClass,CA~, P~EMAX,CA~}

P~CMAX\_H~ (p,q) = MIN {10 log~10~ \[p~CMAX\_\ H,f,c(i),i~ (p) +
p~CMAX\_\ H,f,c(i),j~ (q)\], P~PowerClass,CA~, P~EMAX,CA~}

where p~CMAX\_L,f,c~ ~(i),i~ and p~CMAX\_\ H,f,c(i),i~ are the
respective limits P~CMAX\_L,f,c~ ~(i),i~ and P~CMAX\_H,f,c(i),i~
expressed in linear scale.

T~REF~ and T~eval~ are specified in Table 6.2A.4.1.1-0 when same and
different slot patterns are used in aggregated carriers. For each
T~REF~, the P~CMAX\_L~ is evaluated per T~eval~ and given by the minimum
value taken over the transmission(s) within the T~eval~; the minimum
P~CMAX\_L~ over the one or more T~eval~ is then applied for the entire
T~REF~. The lesser of P~PowerClass,CA~ and P~EMAX,CA~ shall not be
exceeded by the UE during any period of time.

Table 6.2A.4.1.1-0: P~CMAX~ evaluation window for different slot and
channel durations

  -------------------------------------------------- ------------------------- ----------------------------------------------
  T**~REF~**                                         T**~eval~**               T**~eval~** with frequency hopping
  T~REF~ of largest slot duration over both UL CCs   Physical channel length   Min(T~no\_hopping~, Physical Channel Length)
  -------------------------------------------------- ------------------------- ----------------------------------------------

If the UE is configured with multiple TAGs and transmissions of the UE
on slot *i* for any serving cell in one TAG overlap some portion of the
first symbol of the transmission on slot *i* +1 for a different serving
cell in another TAG, the UE minimum of P~CMAX\_L~ for slots *i* and *i*
+ 1 applies for any overlapping portion of slots *i* and *i* + 1. The
lesser of P~PowerClass,CA~ and P~EMAX,CA~ shall not be exceeded by the
UE during any period of time.

The measured maximum output power P~UMAX~ over all serving cells with
same slot pattern shall be within the following range:

P~CMAX\_L~ -- MAX{T~L~, T~LOW~(P~CMAX\_L~) } ≤ P~UMAX~ ≤ P~CMAX\_H~ +
T~HIGH~(P~CMAX\_H~)

P~UMAX~ = 10 log~10~ ∑ p~UMAX,c~

where p~UMAX,c~ denotes the measured maximum output power for serving
cell *c* expressed in linear scale. The tolerances T~LOW~(P~CMAX~) and
T~HIGH~(P~CMAX~) for applicable values of P~CMAX~ are specified in Table
6.2A.4.1.1-1. The tolerance T~L~ is the absolute value of the lower
tolerance for applicable NR CA configuration as specified in Table

shall be set as specified in subclause 6.2.4.

The configured maximum output power PCMAX,c on serving cell c shall be
set as specified in subclause 6.2.4, but with MPRc = MPR and A-MPRc =
A-MPR with MPR and A-MPR as determined by subclause 6.2A.2 and 6.2A.3,
respectively. For PH reporting the following exception applies: if the
UE is configured with multiple uplink serving cells, the power PCMAX,c
used for the purpose of PH reporting on first serving cell c = c1 does
not consider for computation of the PH report transmissions on a second
serving cell c2 as exempted in subclause 7.7.1 in \[8\]. There is one

The total configured maximum output power P~CMAX~ shall be set within
the following bounds:

P~CMAX\_L~ ≤ P~CMAX~ ≤ P~CMAX\_H~

For uplink intra-band non-contiguous carrier aggregation when same slot
pattern is used in all aggregated serving cells,

band shall be applied

b\) When the operating band frequency range is \> 1 GHz, the applicable
additional ∆T~IB,c~ shall be the maximum value for all band combinations

whichever is the smallest if both are present.\[For uplink intra-band
non-contiguous carrier aggregation, when at least one different
numerology/slot pattern is used in aggregated cells, the UE is allowed
to set its configured maximum output power P~CMAX,c(i),i~ for serving
cell c(i) of slot numerology type *i*, and its total configured maximum
output power P~CMAX~.

The configured maximum output power P~CMAX,c(i),i~ (p) in slot p of
serving cell c(i) on slot numerology type *i* shall be set within the
following bounds:

P~CMAX\_L,f,c(i),i~ (p) ≤ P~CMAX,f,c(i),\ i~ (p) ≤ P~CMAX\_H,f,c(i),i~
(p)

where P~CMAX\_L,f,c~ ~(i),i~ (p) and P~CMAX\_H,f,c(i),i~ (p) are the

T~REF~ and T~eval~ are specified in Table 6.2A.4.1.2-1 when same and
different slot patterns are used in aggregated carriers. For each
T~REF~, the P~CMAX\_L~ is evaluated per T~eval~ and given by the minimum
value taken over the transmission(s) within the T~eval~; the minimum

If the UE is configured with multiple TAGs and transmissions of the UE
on slot *i* for any serving cell in one TAG overlap some portion of the
first symbol of the transmission on slot *i* +1 for a different serving
cell in another TAG, the UE minimum of P~CMAX\_L~ for slots *i* and *i*

6.2B Transmitter power for NR-DC
--------------------------------

### 6.2B.0 General

The requirements apply for inter-band NR-DC with one uplink serving cell
configured per CG.

### 6.2B.1 UE maximum output power for NR-DC

For inter-band NR-DC with one uplink carrier assigned per NR band, the
transmitter power requirements in clause 6.2 apply per band.

For inter-band NR-DC with one uplink assigned per band, the UE maximum
output power shall be measured over all component carriers from
different bands. If each band has separate antenna connectors, the
maximum output power is defined as the sum of maximum output power from
each UE antenna connector. The period of measurement shall be at least
one sub frame (1 ms). The maximum output power is specified in Table
6.2B.1.3-1.

### 6.2B.2 UE maximum output power reduction for NR-DC

For inter-band NR-DC with one uplink assigned per band, the requirements
in clause 6.2.2 apply for each uplink component carrier.

### 6.2B.3 UE additional maximum output power reduction for NR-DC

For inter-band NR-DC with one uplink assigned per band, the requirements
in clause 6.2.3 apply for each uplink component carrier.

### 6.2B.4 Configured output power for NR-DC

#### 6.2B.4.1 Configured transmitted power level for NR-DC

The UE is allowed to set its configured maximum output power
P~CMAX,f,*c,MCG\ *~and P~CMAX,f,*c,SCG\ *~for the respective MCG and SCG
and its total configured maximum output power for NR-DC operation
$P_{\text{Total}}^{NR - DC} = 10log10({\widehat{P}}_{\text{Total}}^{NR - DC})$
with ${\widehat{P}}_{\text{Total}}^{NR - DC}$ as specified in clause
7.6.2 of \[8\]. The UE is configured with an inter-CG power sharing mode
by *NR-DC-PC-mode.*The requirements apply for one uplink serving cell
configured per CG and for asynchronous and synchronous NR-DC if not
otherwise stated.

Unless otherwise stated, the configured maximum output power
P~CMAX,f,*c,MCG\ *~(*q*) in physical-channel *q* for carrier *f* of
serving cell *c* shall be set within the bounds if contained in the MCG,

P~CMAX\_L,f,*c,MCG*~ (*q*) ≤ P~CMAX,f,*c,MCG\ *~(*q*) ≤
P~CMAX\_H,f,*c,MCG*~ (*q*)

and the corresponding P~CMAX\_L,f,*c,SCG*~ (*q*) for a serving cell
contained in the SCG,

P~CMAX\_L,f,*c,SCG*~ (*q*) ≤ P~CMAX,f,*c,SCG\ *~(*q*) ≤
P~CMAX\_H,f,*c,SCG*~ (*q*)

where P~CMAX\_L,f,c,MCG~, P~CMAX\_H,f,c,MCG~, P~CMAX\_L,f,c,SCG~ and
P~CMAX\_H,f,c,SCG~ are the limits for a serving cell *c* as specified in
clause 6.2.4 modified as follows:

P~CMAX\_L,f,c,MCG~ = MIN{MIN(P~EMAX,c~ , P~EMAX,NR-DC~, P~NR~) --
∆T~C,c~, (P~PowerClass,NR-DC~ -- ΔP~PowerClass,NR-DC~) --
MAX(MAX(MPR~c~+∆MPR~c~, A-MPR~c~)+ ΔT~IB,c~ + ∆T~C,c~ + ∆T~RxSRS~,
P-MPR~c~)}

P~CMAX\_H,f,c,MCG~ = MIN{P~EMAX,c~, P~EMAX,NR-DC~, P~NR~,
P~PowerClass,\ NR-DC~ -- ΔP~PowerClass,NR-DC~}

for the MCG and

P~CMAX\_L,f,c,SCG~ = MIN{MIN(P~EMAX,c~ , P~EMAX,NR-DC~, P~NR~) --
∆T~C,c~, (P~PowerClass,NR-DC~ -- ΔP~PowerClass,NR-DC~) --
MAX(MAX(MPR~c~+∆MPR~c~, A-MPR~c~)+ ΔT~IB,c~ + ∆T~C,c~ + ∆T~RxSRS~,
P-MPR~c~)}

P~CMAX\_H,f,c,SCG~ = MIN{P~EMAX,c~, P~EMAX,NR-DC~, P~NR~,
P~PowerClass,NR-DC~ -- ΔP~PowerClass,NR-DC~}

for the SCG, where

\- P~EMAX,NR-DC~ is the value given by the field *p-UE-FR1* of the
*PhysicalCellGroupConfig* IE for the MCG as defined in \[7\];

\- P~NR~ is the value given by the field *p-NR-FR1* of the
*PhysicalCellGroupConfig* IE as defined in \[7\];

\- P~PowerClass,NR-DC~ is the maximum UE power specified in Table
6.2B.1.3-1 without taking into account the tolerance specified in the
Table 6.2B.1.3-1;

\- ∆T~IB,c~ is the additional tolerance for serving cell c as specified
in clause 6.2B.4.2 for NR-DC; ∆T~IB,c~ = 0 dB otherwise;

\- ∆T~C,c~ = 1.5dB when NOTE 2 in Table 6.2B.1.3-1 applies for a serving
cell c, otherwise ∆T~C,c~ = 0 dB ;

\- ∆MPR~c~ for serving cell c is specified in clause 6.2.2.

\- ΔP~PowerClass,NR-DC~ = 0 dB for a power class 3 capable UE.

For a UE provided with *NR-DC-PC-mode* = *Semi-static-mode1*,

$P_{\text{Total}}^{NR - DC}$ = MIN{P~EMAX,\ NR-DC~, P~PowerClass,NR-DC~}
+ 0.3 dB

with P~PowerClass,NR-DC~ set to power class 3 in case the UE indicates a
higher power class in any CG. The UE determines the maximum transmission
power for the MCG and the SCG using the respective configured maximum
power P~CMAX,f,*c,MCG\ *~and P~CMAX,f,*c,SCG*~*.*

If for synchronous NR-DC operation a UE is provided *NR-DC-PC-mode* =
*Semi-static-mode2*, the $P_{\text{Total}}^{NR - DC}$ is determined as
above and

\- if at least one symbol of slot $i_{1}$ of the MCG/SCG is indicated as
uplink or flexible to a UE by *tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon* and
*tdd*-*UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated*, if provided, overlaps with a
symbol for any ongoing transmission overlapping with slot $i_{2}$ of the
SCG/MCG, the UE determines a maximum power for the transmission on the
SCG/MCG overlapping with slot $i_{2}$ using the configured maximum power
P~CMAX,f,*c,SCG\ *~or P~CMAX,f,*c,MCG*~ for the SCG or MSG,
respectively,

\- otherwise (i.e. an ongoing transmission overlapping with slot $i_{2}$
of the SCG/MCG overlaps with only semi-static downlink symbols within
slot $i_{1}$ of the MCG/SCG), the UE determines a maximum power for the
transmission on MCG or the SCG overlapping with slot $i_{2}$ using the
configured maximum power as specified in clause 6.2.4.

If a UE indicates a capability for dynamic power sharing between the MCG
and the SCG and is provided with *NR-DC-PC-mode = Dynamic*,

$P_{\text{Total}}^{NR - DC}$ = MIN{P~EMAX,\ NR-DC~, P~PowerClass,NR-DC~}

with P~PowerClass,NR-DC~ set to power class 3 in case the UE indicates a
higher power class in any CG. The UE determines the maximum transmission
power for the MCG and the SCG using the respective configured maximum
power P~CMAX,f,*c,MCG\ *~and P~CMAX,f,*c,SCG*~ *except*

\- if UE transmission(s) in slot $i_{1}$ of the MCG or in slot $i_{2}$
of the SCG do not overlap in time with any UE transmission(s) on the SCG
or the MCG, respectively, the UE determines a maximum transmission power
in slot $i_{1}$ of the MCG or in slot $i_{2}$ of the SCG using the
configured maximum power as specified in clause 6.2.4.

If a UE indicates a capability to determine a total transmission power
on the SCG at a first symbol of a transmission occasion on the SCG by
determining transmissions on the MCG as specified in clause 7.6.2 of
\[8\], and is provided with *NR-DC-PC-mode = Dynamic*,

$P_{\text{Total}}^{NR - DC}$ = MIN{P~EMAX,\ NR-DC~, P~PowerClass,NR-DC~}

with P~PowerClass,NR-DC~ set to power class 3 in case the UE indicates a
higher power class in any CG. The UE determines the maximum transmission
power for the MCG and the SCG using the respective configured maximum
power P~CMAX,f,*c,MCG\ *~and P~CMAX,f,*c,SCG*~*.*

The measured total maximum output power P~UMAX~ over both CGs measured
over the transmission reference time duration is

P~UMAX~ = 10 log~10~ (p~UMAX,*c,MCG*~ + p~UMAX,*c,SCG*~),

where p~UMAX,*c,MSG*~ and p~UMAX,*c,SCG*~ denote the measured output
power of serving cells *c contained in the respective MSG and SCG
expressed in linear scale.*

The measured total configured maximum output power P~UMAX~ shall be
within the following bounds:

P~CMAX\_L~ -T~LOW~ (P~CMAX\_L~) ≤ P~UMAX~ ≤ P~CMAX\_H~ + T~HIGH~
(P~CMAX\_H~)

with the tolerances T~LOW~(P~CMAX\_H~) and T~HIGH~(P~CMAX\_H~) for
applicable values of P~CMAX~ specified in Table 6.2B.4.1.3-2.

When a subframe *p* on the MSG overlap with a physical-channel *q* on
the SCG*,* then for P~UMAX~ evaluation, the subframe *p* on the MCG is
taken as reference period T~REF~ and always considered as the reference
measurement duration and the following rules are applicable.

T~REF~ and T~eval~ are specified in Table 6.2B.4.1.3-1 when same or
different subframe and physical-channel durations are used on the
carriers. The P~PowerClass~ shall not be exceeded by the UE during any
evaluation period of time.

Table 6.2B.4.1.3-1: P~CMAX~ evaluation window

  Transmission duration                                      T~REF~         T~eval~
  ---------------------------------------------------------- -------------- ------------------------------------------------
  Different transmission duration in different CG carriers   MCG subframe   MIN(*T~no\_hopping~*, Physical Channel Length)

For each T~REF~, the P~CMAX\_H~ is evaluated per T~eval~ and given by
the maximum value over the transmission(s) within the T~eval~ as
follows:

P~CMAX\_H~ = MAX{P~CMAX\_NR-DC\_H~(*p,q*), P~CMAX\_NR-DC\_H~(*p,q+1*),
... , P~CMAX\_NR-DC\_H~(*p,q+n*)}

where P~CMAX\_NR-DC\_H~ entries are the applicable upper limits for each
overlapping scheduling unit pairs *(p,q*), (*p, q+1*), up to *(p, q+n*)
for each applicable T~eval~ duration, where *q+n* is the last
physical-channel on the SCG overlapping with subframe *p* on the MCG,
while P~CMAX\_L~ is computed as follows:

P~CMAX\_L~ = MIN{P~CMAX\_NR-DC\_L~(*p,q*), P~CMAX\_NR-DC\_L~(*p,q+1*),
... , P~CMAX\_NR-DC\_L~(*p,q+n*)}

where P~CMAX\_NR-DC\_L~ entries are the applicable lower limits for each
overlapping scheduling unit pairs *(p,q*), (*p, q+1*) up to *(p, q+n*)
for each applicable T~eval~ duration, where *q+n* is the last
physical-channel on the SCG overlapping with subframe *p* on the MCG.

For a UE provided with *NR-DC-PC-mode* = *Semi-static-mode1* and
configured with p~NR,MCG~ + p~NR,SCG~ ≤

with p~CMAX\_L,f,c,MCG~, p~CMAX\_H,f,c,MCG~, p~CMAX\_L,f,c,SCG~, and
p~CMAX\_H,f,c,SCG~ the values of the respective P~CMAX\_L,f,c,MCG~,
P~CMAX\_H,f,c,MCG~, P~CMAX\_L,f,c,MCG~, and P~CMAX\_H,f,c,SCG~ expressed
in linear scale, while the measured configured maximum power P~UMAX~ for
each CG shall meet the requirements as specified in clause 6.2.4 but
with bounds for P~CMAX,f,*c,MCG\ *~(*p*) and P~CMAX,f,*c,SCG\ *~ as
specified in this clause.

then the measured configured maximum power P~UMAX~ for the transmission

6.2D Transmitter power for UL MIMO
----------------------------------

### 6.2D.1 UE maximum output power for UL MIMO

For UE with two transmit antenna connectors in closed-loop spatial
multiplexing scheme, the maximum output power for any transmission
bandwidth within the channel bandwidth is specified in Table 6.2D.1-1.
The requirements shall be met with the UL MIMO configurations specified
in Table 6.2D.1-2. For UE supporting UL MIMO, the maximum output power
is defined as the sum of the maximum output power from both UE antenna
connectors. The period of measurement shall be at least one sub frame (1
ms).

The requirements shall be met with the UL MIMO configurations of using
2-layer UL MIMO transmission with codebook
of![](media/image1.wmf){width="0.6666666666666666in"
height="0.4270833333333333in"}. DCI Format for UE configured in PUSCH
transmission mode for uplink single-user MIMO shall be used.

If UE is scheduled for single antenna-port PUSCH transmission by DCI
format 0\_0 or by DCI format 0\_1 for single antenna port codebook based
transmission, the requirements in clause 6.2.1 apply for the power class
as indicated by the *ue-PowerClass* field in capability signalling.

### 6.2D.2 UE maximum output power reduction for UL MIMO

For UE with two transmit antenna connectors in closed-loop spatial
multiplexing scheme, the allowed Maximum Power Reduction (MPR) for the
maximum output power in Table 6.2D.1-1 is specified in Table 6.2.2-1.
The requirements shall be met with UL MIMO configurations defined in
Table 6.2D.1-2. For UE supporting UL MIMO, the maximum output power is
defined as the sum of the maximum output power from both UE antenna
connectors.

For UE support uplink full power transmission (ULFPTx) for UL MIMO, the
allowed MPR for the maximum output power in Table 6.2D.1-1 is specified
in Table 6.2.2-1, and the requirements shall be met with the PUSCH
configurations specified in Table 6.2D.1-3, based upon UE's support of
uplink full power transmission mode.

For the UE maximum output power modified by MPR, the power limits
specified in clause 6.2D.4 apply.

If UE is scheduled for single antenna-port PUSCH transmission by DCI
format 0\_0 or by DCI format 0\_1 for single antenna port codebook based
transmission, the requirements in clause 6.2.2 apply for the power class
as indicated by the *ue-PowerClass* field in capability signaling.

### 6.2D.3 UE additional maximum output power reduction for UL MIMO

For UE with two transmit antenna connectors in closed-loop spatial
multiplexing scheme, the A-MPR values specified in clause 6.2.3 shall
apply to the maximum output power specified in Table 6.2D.1-1. The
requirements shall be met with the UL MIMO configurations specified in
Table 6.2D.1-2. For UE supporting UL MIMO, the maximum output power is
defined as the sum of the maximum output power from both UE antenna
connector. Unless stated otherwise, an A-MPR of 0 dB shall be used.

For UE support uplink full power transmission (ULFPTx) for UL MIMO, the
A-MPR values specified in clause 6.2.3 shall apply to the maximum output
power specified in Table 6.2D.1-1. The requirements shall be met with
the PUSCH configurations specified in Table 6.2D.1-3, based upon UE's
support of uplink full power transmission mode.

For the UE maximum output power modified by A-MPR, the power limits
specified in clause 6.2D.4 apply.

If UE is scheduled for single antenna-port PUSCH transmission by DCI
format 0\_0 or by DCI format 0\_1 for single antenna port codebook based
transmission, the requirements in clause 6.2.4 apply for the power class
as indicated by the *ue-PowerClass* field in capability signaling.

### 6.2D.4 Configured transmitted power for UL MIMO

For UE supporting UL MIMO, the transmitted power is configured per each
UE.

The definitions of configured maximum output power P~CMAX,*c*~, the
lower bound P~CMAX\_L,*c*~, and the higher bound P~CMAX\_H,*c*~
specified in clause 6.2.4 shall apply to UE supporting UL MIMO, where

\- P~PowerClass~, ΔP~PowerClass~ and ∆T~C,c~ are specified in clause
6.2.4 unless otherwise stated;

\- MPR~c~ is specified in clause 6.2D.2;

\- A-MPR~c~ is specified in clause 6.2D.3.

The measured configured maximum output power P~UMAX,*c*~ for serving
cell *c* shall be within the following bounds:

P~CMAX\_L,*c*~ -- MAX{T~L~, T ~LOW~(P~CMAX\_L,*c*~)} ≤ P~UMAX,*c*~ ≤
P~CMAX\_H,*c*~ + T ~HIGH~(P~CMAX\_H,*c*~)

where T~LOW~(P~CMAX\_L,*c*~) and T~HIGH~(P~CMAX\_H,*c*~) are defined as
the tolerance and applies to P~CMAX\_L,*c*~ and P~CMAX\_H,*c*~
separately, while T~L~ is the absolute value of the lower tolerance in
Table 6.2D.1-1 for the applicable operating band.

For UE with two transmit antenna connectors in closed-loop spatial
multiplexing scheme, the tolerance is specified in Table 6.2D.4-1. The
requirements shall be met with UL MIMO configurations specified in Table
6.2D.1-2.

For UE support uplink full power transmission (ULFPTx) for UL MIMO, the
tolerance is specified in Table 6.2D.4-1. The requirements shall be met
with the PUSCH configurations specified in Table 6.2D.1-3, based upon
UE's support of uplink full power transmission mode.

### 6.2E.2 UE maximum output power reduction for V2X

#### 6.2E.2.1 General

When UE is configured for NR V2X sidelink transmissions non-concurrent
with NR uplink transmissions for NR V2X operating bands specified in
Table 5.2E.1-1, this clause specifies the allowed Maximum Power
Reduction (MPR) power for V2X physical channels and signals due to
PSCCH/PSSCH, PSFCH and S-SSB transmission.

#### 6.2E.2.2 MPR for Power class 3 V2X UE

For contiguous allocation of PSCCH and PSSCH simultaneous transmission,
the allowed MPR for the maximum output power for NR V2X physical
channels PSCCH and PSSCH shall be as specified in Table 6.2E.2.2-1 for
Power class 3 NR V2X UE.

Table 6.2E.2.2-1: Maximum Power Reduction (MPR) for power class 3 NR V2X

  Modulation   Channel bandwidth/MPR (dB)                          
  ------------ ---------------------------- ---------------------- -------
               Outer RB allocations         Inner RB allocations   
  CP-OFDM      QPSK                         ≤ 4.5                  ≤ 2.5
               16QAM                        ≤ 4.5                  ≤ 2.5
               64 QAM                       ≤ 4.5                  
               256 QAM                      ≤ 7.0                  

Where the following parameters are defined to specify valid RB
allocation ranges for Outer and Inner RB allocations:

N~RB~ is the maximum number of RBs for a given Channel bandwidth and
sub-carrier spacing defined in Table 5.3.2-1.

> RB~Start,Low~ = max(1, floor(L~CRB~/2))

where max() indicates the largest value of all arguments and floor(x) is
the greatest integer less than or equal to x.

RB~Start,High~ = N~RB~ -- RB~Start,Low~ -- L~CRB~

The RB allocation is an Inner RB allocation if the following conditions
are met

RB~Start,Low~ ≤ RB~Start~ ≤ RB~Start,High~, and

L~CRB~ ≤ ceil(N~RB~/2)

where ceil(x) is the smallest integer greater than or equal to x.

The RB allocation is an Outer RB allocation for all other allocations
which are not an Inner RB allocation.

For PSFCH with single RB transmission for PC3 NR V2X UE, the required
MPR is defined as follow

MPR\_~PSFCH~ = 3.5 dB

For contiguous and non-contiguous allocation for simultaneous PSFCH
transmission for PC3 NR V2X UE, the required MPR are specified as follow

> MPR\_~PSFCH~ = CEIL {M~A\_PSFCH~, 0.5}

Where M~A\_PSFCH~ is defined as follows

> M~A\_PSFCH~ = 7.5 ; 0.00\< N~Gap~/N~RB~ ≤ 0.55
>
> = 12.0 ; 0.55\< N~Gap~/N~RB~ ≤1.0

Where,

> N~Gap~ is the gap RB amount between RB~start~ and RB~end~ for
> contiguous and non-contiguous allocation simultaneous PSFCH
> transmission. (N~Gap~ = RB~end~ - RB~start~)
>
> CEIL{M~A,~ 0.5} means rounding upwards to closest 0.5dB.

The allowed MPR for the maximum output power for NR V2X physical
channels on S-SSB transmission shall be specified in Table 6.2E.2.2-2.

Table 6.2E.2.2-2: Maximum Power Reduction (MPR) for S-SSB transmission
for power class 3 NR V2X

  Channel   MPR~S-SSB~ (dB)        
  --------- ---------------------- ----------------------
            Outer RB allocations   Inner RB allocations
  S-SSB     ≤ 6.0                  ≤ 2.5

For NR V2X UE with two transmit antenna connectors, the allowed Maximum
Power Reduction (MPR) values specified in current clause shall apply to
the maximum output power specified in Table 6.2E.1.1-1. The requirements
shall be met with SL MIMO configurations defined in Table 6.2D.1-2. For
UE supporting SL MIMO, the maximum output power is defined as the sum of
the maximum output power from each UE antenna connector.

For the UE maximum output power modified by MPR, the power limits
specified in clause 6.2E.4 apply.

#### 6.2E.2.3 MPR for Power class 3 V2X con-current operation

For the inter-band con-current NR V2X operation, the allowed maximum
power reduction (MPR) for the maximum output power shall be applied per
each component carrier. The MPR requirements in clause 6.2.2 apply for
NR Uu operation in licensed band, and the MPR requirements in clause
6.2E.2 apply for NR sidelink operation in licensed band or Band n47.

### 6.2E.3 UE additional maximum output power reduction for V2X

#### 6.2E.3.1 General

For the applied maximum output power reduction is obtained by taking the
maximum value of MPR requirements specified in clause 6.2E.2 and A-MPR
requirements specified in current clause.

Additional emission requirements can be indicated by the network or
pre-configured radio parameters. Each additional emission requirement is
associated with a unique network signalling (NS) value indicated in RRC
signalling by an NR frequency band number of the applicable operating
band and an associated value in the field
\[*additionalSpectrumEmission*\]*.* Throughout this specification, the
notion of indication or signalling of an NS value refers to the
corresponding indication of an NR V2X frequency band number of the
applicable operating band, the IE field \[*freqBandIndicatorNR*\] and an
associated value of \[*additionalSpectrumEmission*\] in the relevant RRC
information elements \[7\]*.*

To meet the additional requirements, additional maximum power reduction
(A-MPR) is allowed for the maximum output power as specified in Table
6.2.1-1. Unless stated otherwise, the total reduction to UE maximum
output power is max(MPR, A-MPR) where MPR is defined in clause 6.2E.2.
Outer and inner allocation notation used in clause 6.2E.3.2 is defined
in clause 6.2E.2. In absence of modulation and waveform types the A-MPR
applies to all modulation and waveform types.

specified in Table 6.2E.1.1-1. The requirements shall be met with the SL
MIMO configurations specified in Table 6.2D.1-2. For UE supporting SL
MIMO, the maximum output power is defined as the sum of the maximum
output power from each UE antenna connector. Unless stated otherwise, an
A-MPR of 0 dB shall be used.

For the UE maximum output power modified by A-MPR, the power limits
specified in clause 6.2E.4 apply.

#### 6.2E.3.2 A-MPR for Power class 3 V2X UE by NS\_33

When NS\_33 is indicated by the network or pre-configured radio
parameters for NR V2X UE, the additional maximum output power reduction
specified as

A-MPR = CEIL {M~A~, 0.5}

Where M~A~ is defined as follows

M~A~ = A-MPR~Base~ + G~post\ connector~\* A-MPRStep

CEIL{M~A,~ 0.5} means rounding upwards to closest 0.5dB.

A-MPR~Base~ and A-MPR~Step~ are specified in Tables 6.2E.3.2-1,
6.2E.3.2-2 is allowed when network signalling value is provided*.*
A-MPR~Base~ is the default A-MPR value when no G~post\ connector~ is
declared. The supported post antenna connector gain G~post\ connector~
is declared by the UE following the principle described in annex I in
\[11\]. The A-MPR~step~ is the increase in A-MPR allowance to allow UE
to meet tighter conducted A-SE and A-SEM requirements with higher value
of declared G~post\ connector~.

For the contiguous PSSCH and PSCCH transmission when NS\_33 is indicated
by the network or pre-configured radio parameters for NR V2X UE, the NR
UE allow the follow A-MPR requirements.

#### 6.2E.3.4 A-MPR for power class 3 V2X con-current operation

For the inter-band con-current NR V2X operation, the allowed additional
maximum power reduction (A-MPR) for the maximum output power shall be
applied per each component carrier. The A-MPR requirements in clause
6.2.3 apply for NR Uu operation in licensed band, and the A-MPR
requirements in clause 6.2E.3.2 and 6.2E.3.3 apply for NR sidelink
operation in Band n47.

### 6.2E.4 Configured transmitted power for V2X

#### 6.2E.4.1 General

The NR V2X UE is allowed to set its configured maximum output power
P~CMAX,f,*c*~ for carrier f of serving cell *c* in each slot. The
configured maximum output power P~CMAX,f,*c*~ is set within the
following bounds:

P~CMAX\_L,f,c~ ≤ P~CMAX,f,*c*~ ≤ P~CMAX\_H,f,*c*~ with

P~CMAX\_L,f,\ *c*~ = MIN {P~EMAX,*c*~, P~PowerClass,\ V2X~ --
MAX(MAX(MPR*~c~* , A-MPR*~c~*) + ∆T~IB,*c*~ , P-MPR*~c~*),
P~Regulatory,c~ }

P~CMAX\_H,f,\ *c*~ = MIN {P~EMAX,*c*~, P~PowerClass,V2X~,
P~Regulatory,c~ }

where

\- P~CMAX,f,*c\ *~is configured for PSSCH\\PSCCH, S-SSB and PSFCH,
respectively;

\- For the total transmitted power P~CMAX,PSSCH/PSCCH~ , P~EMAX,c~ is
the value given by IE *sl-maxTransPower*, defined by TS 38.331.

\- For the total transmitted power P~CMAX,S-SSB~, the
P~CMAX\_L,f,*c\ *~and P~CMAX\_H,f,*c*~ are defined as follows:

> P~CMAX\_L,f,*c*~ = MIN {P~PowerClass,\ V2X~ -- MAX(MAX(MPR*~c~* ,
> A-MPR*~c~*) + ∆T~IB,*c*~ , P-MPR*~c~*), P~Regulatory,c~}
>
> P~CMAX\_H,f,*c*~ = MIN {P~PowerClass,\ V2X~, P~Regulatory,c~}

\- For the total transmitted power P~CMAX,PSFCH~, P~EMAX,c~ is the value
given by IE *sl-maxTransPower* when single resource pool configured is
transmitted at a given time and sum of the IEs *sl-maxTransPower* when
multiple resource pools configured are transmitted at a given time,
defined by TS 38.331.

\- P~PowerClass,V2X~ is the maximum UE power specified in Table
6.2E.1.1-1 without taking into account the tolerance specified in the
Table 6.2E.1.1-1;

\- MPR*~c~* and A-MPR*~c~* for serving cell *c* are specified in clause
6.2E.2 and clause 6.2E.3 for PSSCH\\PSCCH, S-SSB and PSFCH,
respectively;

\-  ∆*T~IB,c~* and P-MPR*~c~* are specified in clause 6.2.4

\- P~Regulatory,c~ = 10 - G~post\ connector~ dBm the V2X UE is within
the protected zone \[12\] of CEN DSRC tolling system and operating in
Band n47; P~Regulatory,c~ = 33 - G~post\ connector~ dBm otherwise.

The maximum output power P*~CMAX,PSSCH~* and P*~CMAX,PSCCH~* are derived
from P~CMAX,c~ based on 0dB PSD offset between PSSCH and PSCCH.

For the measured configured maximum output power P~UMAX,*c*~ for NR V2X
sidelink transmissions non-concurrent with NR uplink transmissions, the
same requirement as in clause 6.2.4 shall be applied.

For NR V2X UE supporting SL MIMO, the transmitted power is configured
per each UE.

For NR V2X UE with two transmit antenna connectors, the tolerance is
specified in Table 6.2E.4.1-1. The requirements shall be met with SL
MIMO configurations specified in Table 6.2D.1-2.

If the UE transmits on two antenna connectors at the same time, the
tolerance is specified in Table 6.2E.4.1-1.

#### 6.2E.4.2 Configured transmitted power for V2X con-current operation

When a UE is configured for simultaneous NR V2X sidelink and NR uplink
transmissions for inter-band con-current operation, the UE is allowed to
set its configured maximum output power P~CMAX,*c*,*NR*~ and
P~CMAX,*c*,*V2X*~ for the configured NR uplink carrier and the
configured NR V2X carrier, respectively, and its total configured
maximum output power P~CMAX,c~.

The configured maximum output power P~CMAX\ *c*,*NR*~*(p)* in slot *p*
for the configured NR uplink carrier shall be set within the bounds:

P~CMAX\_L,*c,NR*~ (*p*) ≤ P~CMAX,*c,NR\ *~(*p*) ≤ P~CMAX\_H,*c,NR*~
(*p*)

where P~CMAX\_L,*c,NR\ *~and P~CMAX\_H,*c,NR*~ are the limits for a
serving cell c as specified in clause 6.2.4.

The configured maximum output power P~CMAX\ *c*,*V2X\ *~*(q)* in slot
*q* for the configured NR V2X carrier shall be set within the bounds:

P~CMAX,*c,V2X\ *~(*q*) ≤ P~CMAX\_H,*c,V2X*~ (*q*)

where P~CMAX\_H,*c,V2X*~ is the limit as specified in clause 6.2E.4.1.

The total UE configured maximum output power P~CMAX~ (*p,q*) in a slot
*p* of NR uplink carrier and a slot *q* of NR V2X sidelink that overlap
in time shall be set within the following bounds for synchronous and
asynchronous operation unless stated otherwise:

P~CMAX\_L~ (*p,q*) ≤ P~CMAX~ (*p,q*) ≤ P~CMAX\_H~ (*p,q*)

with

P~CMAX\_L~ (*p,q*) = P~CMAX\_L,*c,NR*~ (*p*)

P~CMAX\_H~ (*p,q*) = 10 log~10~ \[p~CMAX\_H,*c,NR*~ (*p*) +
p~CMAX\_H,*c,V2X*~ (*q*)\]

where p~CMAX\_H*,c,V2X*~ and p~CMAX\_H,*c,NR*~ are the limits
P~CMAX\_H,*c,V2X*~ (*q*) and P~CMAX\_H,*c,NR*~ (*p*) expressed in linear
scale.

The measured total maximum output power P~UMAX~ over both the NR uplink
and NR V2X carriers is

P~UMAX~ = 10 log~10~ \[p~UMAX,*c,NR*~ + p~UMAX,*c,V2X*~\],

where p~UMAX,*c,NR\ *~ denotes the measured output power of serving cell
*c* for the configured NR uplink carrier, and p~UMAX,*c,V2X\ *~denotes
the measured output power for the configured NR V2X carrier expressed in
linear scale.

When a UE is configured for synchronous V2X sidelink and uplink
transmissions,

P~CMAX\_L~(*p, q*) -- T~LOW~ (P~CMAX\_L~(*p, q*)) ≤ P~UMAX~ ≤
P~CMAX\_H~(*p, q*) + T~HIGH~ (P~CMAX\_H~(*p, q*))

where P~CMAX\_L~ (*p,q*) and P~CMAX\_H~ (*p,q*) are the limits for the
pair (*p,q*) and with the tolerances T~LOW~(P~CMAX~) and
T~HIGH~(P~CMAX~) for applicable values of P~CMAX~ specified in Table
6.2E.4.1-1. P~CMAX\_L~ may be modified for any overlapping portion of
slots *(p, q)* and *(p +1, q+1).*

6.2F Transmitter power for shared spectrum channel access
---------------------------------------------------------

### 6.2F.1 UE maximum output power

The following UE Power Classes define the maximum output power for any
transmission bandwidth within the channel bandwidth of shared spectrum
channel access carrier unless otherwise stated. The period of
measurement shall be at least one sub frame (1ms).

### 6.2F.1A UE maximum output power for CA

#### 6.2F.1A.1 UE maximum output power for inter-band CA

For inter-band carrier aggregation with one uplink carrier assigned to
one NR band, the transmitter power requirements in clause 6.2 apply.

For inter-band carrier aggregation with uplink assigned to two NR bands,
UE maximum output power shall be measured over all component carriers
from different bands. If each band has separate antenna connectors,
maximum output power is defined as the sum of maximum output power from
each UE antenna connector. The period of measurement shall be at least
one sub frame (1 ms). The maximum output power is specified in Table
6.2F.1.3A-1.

### 6.2F.2 UE maximum output power reduction

For UE maximum output power reduction, the general requirements of
clause 6.2.2 do not apply but instead the UE is allowed to reduce the
maximum output power due to higher order modulations and transmit
bandwidth configurations for power class 5 according to Table 6.2F.2-1
and Table 6.2F.2-2.

  NOTE 1: The sub-band configuration is represented as a bitmap where '1' indicates that a sub-band is transmitted and '0' indicates a sub-band is not transmitted. The bitmap is ordered with MSB mapped to the lowest frequency sub-band and LSB mapped to highest frequency sub-band within the wideband channel.                                        

For the UE maximum output power modified by MPR, the power limits
specified in clause 6.2F.4 apply.

### 6.2F.2A UE maximum output power reduction for CA

#### 6.2F.2A.1 UE maximum output power reduction for inter-band CA

For inter-band carrier aggregation with uplink assigned to two bands,
the requirements in clause 6.2.2 apply for the NR uplink carrier and
clause 6.2F.2 for the carrier operating with shared spectrum access.

### 6.2F.3 UE additional maximum output power reduction

#### 6.2F.3.1 General

Additional emission requirements can be signalled by the network. Each
additional emission requirement is associated with a unique network
signalling (NS) value indicated in RRC signalling by an NR frequency
band number of the applicable operating band and an associated value in
the field *additionalSpectrumEmission.* Throughout this specification,
the notion of indication or signalling of an NS value refers to the
corresponding indication of an NR frequency band number of the
applicable operating band, the IE field *freqBandIndicatorNR* and an
associated value of *additionalSpectrumEmission* in the relevant RRC
information elements \[7\]*.*

To meet the additional requirements, additional maximum power reduction
(A-MPR) is allowed for the maximum output power as specified in Table
6.2F.1-1. Unless stated otherwise, the total reduction to UE maximum
output power is max(MPR, A-MPR) where MPR is defined in clause 6.2F.2.

Table 6.2F.3.1-1 specifies the additional requirements with their
associated network signalling values and the allowed A-MPR and
applicable operating band(s) for each NS value. The mapping of NR
frequency band numbers and values of the *additionalSpectrumEmission* to
network signalling labels is specified in Table 6.2F.3.1-1A.

  NOTE 1: Full allocation A-MPR applies when all RB's in a 20 MHz channel or all RB's in all sub-bands for wideband operation are fully allocated and all sub-bands are transmitted. Partial allocation A-MPR applies when one or more RB's in one or more sub-bands are not allocated but when all sub-bands within the channel are transmitted. When not all sub-bands within the channel are transmitted, the A-MPR associated with the channel bandwidth according to the bandwidth of the contiguously transmitted sub-bands and according to the allocation type applies.

  NOTE 1: Full allocation A-MPR applies when all RB's in a 20 MHz channel or all RB's in all sub-bands for wideband operation are fully allocated and all sub-bands are transmitted. Partial allocation A-MPR applies when one or more RB's in one or more sub-bands are not allocated but when all sub-bands within the channel are transmitted. When not all sub-bands within the channel are transmitted, the A-MPR associated with the channel bandwidth according to the bandwidth of the contiguously transmitted sub-bands and according to the allocation type applies.

### 6.3.3 Transmit ON/OFF time mask

#### 6.3.3.1 General

The transmit power time mask defines the transient period(s) allowed

\- between transmit OFF power as defined in clause 6.3.2 and transmit ON
power symbols (transmit ON/OFF)

\- between continuous ON-power transmissions with power change or RB
hopping is applied. When a UE signals the transient period capability,
the transient period value (*tp) can be 2, 4, or 7*μs*. If no capability
is signalled, the default transient period value of 10*μs *applies.*

In case of RB hopping, and in following figures where *tp~start~ is
specified, the* transient period is shared symmetrically when the
transient period is 10usec. If the *UE signals a transient period (tp)
of 2, 4 or 7*μs*, the transient period start position is given by
tp~start~* in *Table 6.3.3.1-1.*

Table 6.3.3.1-1: tp~start~ values

  tp (μs)                                                                                    tp~start~ (μs)

  NOTE 1: Negative values mean that the transient period starts before the symbol boundary   

Unless otherwise stated the requirements in clause 6.5 apply also in
transient periods.

In the following clauses, following definitions apply:

\- A slot or long subslot transmission is a transmission with more than
2 symbols.

\- A short subslot transmission is a transmission with 1 or 2 symbols.

#### 6.3.3.2 General ON/OFF time mask

The general ON/OFF time mask defines the observation period between
transmit OFF and ON power and between transmit ON and OFF power for each
SCS. ON/OFF scenarios include: contiguous, and non-contiguous
transmission, etc

The OFF power measurement period is defined in a duration of at least
one slot excluding any transient periods. The ON power is defined as the
mean power over one slot excluding any transient period.

#### 6.3.3.3 Transmit power time mask for slot and short or long subslot boundaries

The transmit power time mask for slot and a long subslot transmission
boundaries defines the transient periods allowed between slot and long
subslot PUSCH transmissions. For PUSCH-PUCCH and PUSCH-SRS transitions
and multiplexing the time masks in clause 6.3.3.7 apply.

The transmit power time mask for slot or long subslot and short subslot
transmission boundaries defines the transient periods allowed between
slot or long subslot and short subslot transmissions. The time masks in
clause 6.3.3.8 apply.

The transmit power time mask for short subslot transmission boundaries
defines the transient periods allowed between short subslot
transmissions. The time masks in clause 6.3.3.9 apply.

#### 6.3.3.4 PRACH time mask

The PRACH ON power is specified as the mean power over the PRACH
measurement period excluding any transient periods as shown in Figure
6.3.3.4-1. The measurement period for different PRACH preamble format is
specified in Table 6.3.3.4-1.

where \"other sets\" belongs to a \"usage set\" other than the set for
antenna switching. The usage sets for SRS switching are defined in
clause 6.2.1 of TS 38.214 \[10\].

NOTE: Guard period of one symbol is defined between two SRS resources of
an SRS resource set for antenna switching for 15kHz, 30kHz and 60kHz SCS
in Table 6.2.1.2-1 of TS 38.214 \[10\].

The above transient period applies to all the transmit CCs in CA with
the CC sounding SRS. UE RF requirements do not apply during this
transient period.

#### 6.3.3.7 PUSCH-PUCCH and PUSCH-SRS time masks

The PUCCH/PUSCH/SRS time mask defines the observation period between
sounding reference symbol (SRS) and an adjacent PUSCH/PUCCH symbol and
subsequent UL transmissions. The time masks apply for all types of frame
structures and their allowed PUCCH/PUSCH/SRS transmissions unless
otherwise stated.

transmission time mask

This transient period of 15 µsec applies before and after SRS
transmission to all the transmit CCs in CA with the CC sounding SRS. UE
RF requirements do not apply during this transient period.

When there is no transmission preceding SRS transmission or succeeding
SRS transmission, then the same time mask applies as shown in Figure
6.3.3.7-1.

### 6.3.4 Power control

#### 6.3.4.1 General

The requirements on power control accuracy apply under normal
conditions. For UE power class 1.5 the power control accuracy
requirements apply for the sum of the output power from both UE antenna
connectors.

#### 6.3.4.2 Absolute power tolerance

The absolute power tolerance is the ability of the UE transmitter to set
its initial output power to a specific value for the first sub-frame (1
ms) at the start of a contiguous transmission or non-contiguous
transmission with a transmission gap larger than 20 ms. The tolerance
includes the channel estimation error.

The minimum requirement specified in Table 6.3.4.2-1 apply in the power
range bounded by the minimum output power as specified in clause 6.3.1
and the maximum output power as specified in clause 6.2.1.

Table 6.3.4.2-1: Absolute power tolerance

  Conditions   Tolerance
  ------------ -----------
  Normal       ± 9.0 dB

#### 6.3.4.3 Relative power tolerance

The relative power tolerance is the ability of the UE transmitter to set
its output power in a target sub-frame (1 ms) relatively to the power of
the most recently transmitted reference sub-frame (1 ms) if the
transmission gap between these sub-frames is less than or equal to 20
ms.

The minimum requirements specified in Table 6.3.4.3-1 apply when the
power of the target and reference sub-frames are within the power range
bounded by the minimum output power as defined in clause 6.3.1 and the
measured P~UMAX~ as defined in clause 6.2.4.

To account for RF Power amplifier mode changes, 2 exceptions are allowed
for each of two test patterns. The test patterns are a monotonically
increasing power sweep and a monotonically decreasing power sweep over a
range bounded by the requirements of minimum power and maximum power
specified in clauses 6.3.1 and 6.2.1, respectively. For those
exceptions, the power tolerance limit is a maximum of ± 6.0 dB in Table
6.3.4.3-1.

carrier shall apply to the sum of output power at each transmit antenna
connector.

If the UE transmits on one antenna connector at a time, the requirements
for single carrier shall apply to the active antenna connector.

#### 6.3E.4.2 Absolute power tolerance

The requirements in clause 6.3.4.2 shall apply for NR V2X transmission.

#### 6.3E.4.3 Power control for V2X con-current operation

For the inter-band con-current NR V2X operation, the requirements
specified in clause 6.3.4 shall apply for the uplink in licensed band
and the requirements specified in clause 6.3E.4.1 and 6.3E.4.2 shall
apply for the sidelink in licensed band or Band n47.

6.3F Output power dynamics for shared spectrum channel access
-------------------------------------------------------------

### 6.3F.1 Minimum output power

The requirements for minimum output power in clause 6.3.1 apply.

### 6.3F.2 Transmit OFF power

The requirements for Transmit OFF power in clause 6.3.2 apply.

### 6.3F.3 Transmit ON/OFF time mask

#### 6.3F.3.1 General

The transmit power time mask defines the transient period(s) allowed
between transmit OFF power as defined in clause 6.3F.2 and transmit ON
power symbols (transmit ON/OFF). The transmit power ON/OFF time mask
specified in clause 6.3F.3.2 supercedes the ON/OFF masks specified in
clause 6.3.3; however, between continuous ON-power transmissions the
requirements in clause 6.3.3 apply. Unless otherwise stated the
requirements in clause 6.5F apply also in transient periods.

#### 6.3F.3.2 General ON/OFF time mask

The general ON/OFF time mask defines the observation period between
transmit OFF and ON power and between transmit ON and OFF power for each
SCS as illustrated below in Figure 6.3F.3.2-1. ON/OFF scenarios include:
contiguous, and non-contiguous transmission, etc.

The OFF power measurement period is defined in a duration of at least
one slot excluding any transient periods. The ON power is defined as the
mean power over the duration of at least one slot excluding any
transient period and non-transmitted symbols. The leading transient
period starts 5us before the beginning of the first symbol of
transmission and extends 10us into the transmission including the CP
extension if applicable. The trailing transient period starts 5us before
the end of transmssion and extends 5us beyond the end of transmission.

channel access**

### 6.3F.3A General ON/OFF mask for CA

#### 6.3F.3A.1 General ON/OFF mask for inter-band CA

For inter-band carrier aggregation with uplink assigned to two bands,
the general output power ON/OFF time mask specified in clause 6.3.3.1 is
applicable for the NR uplink carrier while the general output power
ON/OFF time mask specified in clause 6.3F.3 is applicable for the
carrier operating with shared spectrum access. The OFF period as
specified in clause 6.3.3.1 and clause 6.3F.3 shall only be applicable
for each component carrier when all the component carriers are OFF.

### 6.3F.4 Power control

#### 6.3F.4.1 General

The requirements on power control accuracy apply under normal
conditions.

#### 6.3F.4.2 Absolute power tolerance

The absolute power tolerance requirements of clause 6.3.4.2 apply at the
start of a contiguous transmission or non-contiguous transmission with a
transmission gap larger than 40 ms.

#### 6.3F.4.3 Relative power tolerance

The relative power tolerance requirements of clause 6.3.4.3 apply if the
transmission gap between the target sub-frame and the reference
sub-frame is less than or equal to 40 ms.

#### 6.3F.4.4 Aggregate power tolerance

The aggregate power tolerance requirements of clause 6.3.4.4 apply
during non-contiguous transmissions within 41ms with respect to the
first UE transmission.

6.4 Transmit signal quality
---------------------------

### 6.4.1 Frequency error

The UE basic measurement interval of modulated carrier frequency is 1 UL
slot. The mean value of basic measurements of UE modulated carrier
frequency shall be accurate to within ± 0.1 PPM observed over a period
of 1 ms of cumulated measurement intervals compared to the carrier
frequency received from the NR Node B.

### 6.4.2 Transmit modulation quality

#### 6.4.2.0 General

Transmit modulation quality defines the modulation quality for expected
in-channel RF transmissions from the UE. The transmit modulation quality
is specified in terms of:

\- Error Vector Magnitude (EVM) for the allocated resource blocks (RBs)

\- EVM equalizer spectrum flatness derived from the equalizer
coefficients generated by the EVM measurement process

\- Carrier leakage

\- In-band emissions for the non-allocated RB

All the parameters defined in clause 6.4.2 are defined using the
measurement methodology specified in Annex F.

In case the parameter 3300 or 3301 is reported from UE via the parameter
*txDirectCurrentLocation* in *UplinkTxDirectCurrentList* IE (as defined
in TS 38.331 \[7\]), carrier leakage measurement requirement in clause
6.4.2.2 and 6.4.2.3 shall be waived, and the RF correction with regard
to the carrier leakage and IQ image shall be omitted during the
calculation of transmit modulation quality.

#### 6.4.2.1 Error Vector Magnitude

The Error Vector Magnitude is a measure of the difference between the
reference waveform and the measured waveform. This difference is called
the error vector. Before calculating the EVM the measured waveform is
corrected by the sample timing offset and RF frequency offset. Then the
carrier leakage shall be removed from the measured waveform before
calculating the EVM.

The measured waveform is further equalised using the channel estimates
subjected to the EVM equaliser spectrum flatness requirement specified
in clause 6.4.2.4. For DFT-s-OFDM waveforms, the EVM result is defined
after the front-end FFT and IDFT as the square root of the ratio of the
mean error vector power to the mean reference power expressed as a %.
For CP-OFDM waveforms, the EVM result is defined after the front-end FFT
as the square root of the ratio of the mean error vector power to the
mean reference power expressed as a %.

The basic EVM measurement interval in the time domain is one preamble
sequence for the PRACH and one slotfor PUCCH and PUSCH in the time
domain. The EVM measurement interval is reduced by any symbols that
contains an allowable power transient in the measurement interval, as
defined in clause 6.3.3.

The RMS average of the basic EVM measurements over 10 subframes for the
average EVM case, and over 60 subframes for the reference signal EVM
case, for the different modulation schemes shall not exceed the values
specified in Table 6.4.2.1-1 for the parameters defined in Table
6.4.2.1-2. For EVM evaluation purposes, all 13 PRACH preamble formats
and all 5 PUCCH formats are considered to have the same EVM requirement
as QPSK modulated.

For UE power class 1.5 the EVM is first measured per UE antenna
connector and then evaluated according to the measurement method
applicable for UEs indicating *txDiverisity-r16*.

#### 6.4.2.1a Error Vector Magnitude including symbols with transient period 

In 6.4.2.1, EVM has been defined by excluding the symbols which have a
transient period. In this section, measurement interval is defined for
the symbols with a transient period to include these symbols in the RMS
average EVM computation when the UE reports a transient period
capability other than the default. Before calculating the EVM, the
measured waveform is corrected for sample timing offset and RF frequency
offset. Then the carrier leakage shall be removed from the measured
waveform before calculating the EVM. The symbols with transient period
should not be used for equalization. Only CP-OFDM waveform is used for
conformance testing.

In the case of PUSCH or PUCCH transmissions when the mean power,
modulation or RB allocation across slot or subslot boundaries is
expected to change the EVM result over the symbols where the transient
occurs is calculated according to Table 6.4.2.1a-1.

#### 6.4.2.2 Carrier leakage

Carrier leakage is an additive sinusoid waveform whose frequency is the
same as the modulated waveform carrier frequency. The measurement
interval is one slot in the time domain.

In the case that uplink sharing, the carrier leakage may have 7.5 kHz
shift with the carrier frequency.

The relative carrier leakage power is a power ratio of the additive
sinusoid waveform and the modulated waveform. The relative carrier
leakage power shall not exceed the values specified in Table 6.4.2.2-1.

  **Parameter**                       **Relative Limit (dBc)**

  0 dBm ≤ Output power ≤ 10 dBm       -25
  -30 dBm ≤ Output power \< 0 dBm     -20
  -40 dBm ≤ Output power \< -30 dBm   -10

#### 6.4.2.3 In-band emissions

The in-band emission is defined as the average emission across 12
sub-carriers and as a function of the RB offset from the edge of the
allocated UL transmission bandwidth. The in-band emission is measured as
the ratio of the UE output power in a non--allocated RB to the UE output
power in an allocated RB.

The basic in-band emissions measurement interval is defined over one
slot in the time domain; however, the minimum requirement applies when
the in-band emission measurement is averaged over 10 sub-frames. When
the PUSCH or PUCCH transmission slot is shortened due to multiplexing
with SRS, the in-band emissions measurement interval is reduced by one
or more symbols, accordingly.

The average of the basic in-band emission measurement over 10 sub-frames
shall not exceed the values specified in Table 6.4.2.3-1.

#### 6.4.2.4 EVM equalizer spectrum flatness

The zero-forcing equalizer correction applied in the EVM measurement
process (as described in Annex F) must meet a spectral flatness
requirement for the EVM measurement to be valid. The EVM equalizer
spectrum flatness is defined in terms of the maximum peak-to-peak ripple
of the equalizer coefficients (dB) across the allocated uplink block.
The basic measurement interval is the same as for EVM.

The peak-to-peak variation of the EVM equalizer coefficients contained
within the frequency range of the uplink allocation shall not exceed the
maximum ripple specified in Table 6.4.2.4-1 for normal conditions. For
uplink allocations contained within both Range 1 and Range 2, the
coefficients evaluated within each of these frequency ranges shall meet
the corresponding ripple requirement and the following additional
requirement: the relative difference between the maximum coefficient in
Range 1 and the minimum coefficient in Range 2 must not be larger than 5
dB, and the relative difference between the maximum coefficient in Range
2 and the minimum coefficient in Range 1 must not be larger than 7 dB
(see Figure 6.4.2.4-1).

The EVM equalizer spectral flatness shall not exceed the values
specified in Table 6.4.2.4-2 for extreme conditions. For uplink
allocations contained within both Range 1 and Range 2, the coefficients
evaluated within each of these frequency ranges shall meet the
corresponding ripple requirement and the following additional
requirement: the relative difference between the maximum coefficient in
Range 1 and the minimum coefficient in Range 2 must not be larger than 6
dB, and the relative difference between the maximum coefficient in Range
2 and the minimum coefficient in Range 1 must not be larger than 10 dB
(see Figure 6.4.2.4-1).

For UE power class 1.5 the EVM equalizer spectrum flatness is measured
according to the measurement method applicable for UEs indicating
*txDiverisity-r16*.

##### 6.4.2.4.1 Requirements for Pi/2 BPSK modulation

These requirements apply if the IE *powerBoostPi2BPSK* is set to 1 for
power class 3 capable UE operating in TDD bands n40, n41, n77, n78 and
n79 with Pi/2 BPSK modulation and UE indicates support for UE capability
*powerBoosting-pi2BPSK* and 40 % or less slots in radio frame are used
for UL transmission. These requirements also apply if the IE
*dmrs-UplinkTransformPrecoding-r16* is configured and UE indicates
support for UE capability *lowPAPR-DMRS-PUSCHwithPrecoding-r16*.
Otherwise the requirements for EVM equalizer spectrum flatness defined
in clause 6.4.2.4 apply.

The EVM equalizer coefficients across the allocated uplink block shall
be modified to fit inside the mask specified in Table 6.4.2.4.1-1 for
normal conditions, prior to the calculation of EVM. The limiting mask
shall be placed to minimize the change in equalizer coefficients in a
sum of squares sense.

6.4A Transmit signal quality for CA
-----------------------------------

### 6.4A.1 Frequency error for CA

#### 6.4A.1.1 Frequency error for intra-band contiguous CA

For intra-band contiguous carrier aggregation the UE modulated carrier
frequencies per band shall be accurate to within ±0.1 PPM observed over
a period of 1 ms of cumulated measurement intervals compared to the
carrier frequency of primary component carrier received in the
corresponding band

#### 6.4A.1.2 Frequency error for intra-band non-contiguous CA

For intra-band non-contiguous carrier aggregation the requirements in
Section 6.4.1 applies per component carrier.

#### 6.4A.1.3 Frequency error for inter-band CA

For inter-band carrier aggregation with one uplink carrier assigned to
one NR band, the frequency error requirements in subclause 6.4.1 apply.

For inter-band carrier aggregation with two contiguous carriers assigned
to one NR band, the frequency error requirements in subclause 6.4A.1.1
apply for those carriers.

For inter-band carrier aggregation with uplink assigned to two NR bands,
the frequency error requirements defined in clause 6.4.1 shall apply on
each component carrier with all component carriers active.

#### 6.4A.1.4 Void

### 6.4A.2 Transmit modulation quality for CA

#### 6.4A.2.1 Transmit modulation quality for intra-band contiguous CA

##### 6.4A.2.1.0 General

For intra-band contiguous carrier aggregation, the requirements in
clauses 6.4A.2.1.1, 6.4A.2.1.2 and 6.4A.2.1.3 applies.

The requirements in this clause apply with PCC and SCC in the UL
configured and activated: PCC with PRB allocation and SCC without PRB
allocation and without CSI reporting and SRS configured.

In case the parameter 3300 or 3301 is reported from UE via
*txDirectCurrentLocation-r16* or *txDirectCurrentLocation* (as defined
in TS 38.331 \[7\]) or UE does not indicate the DC location parameters,
carrier leakage measurement requirement in clause 6.4A.2.1.2 and
6.4A.2.1.3 shall be waived, and the RF correction with regard to the
carrier leakage and IQ image shall be omitted during the calculation of
transmit modulation quality.

##### 6.4A.2.1.1 Error Vector Magnitude

For the intra-band contiguous carrier aggregation, the Error Vector
Magnitude requirement should be defined for each component carrier.
Requirements only apply with PRB allocation in one of the component
carriers. Similar transmitter impairment removal procedures are applied
for CA waveform before EVM calculation as is specified for non-CA
waveform in sub-clause 6.4.2.1.

When a single component carrier is configured Table 6.4.2.1-1 apply.

The EVM requirements are according to Table 6.4A.2.1.1-1 if CA is
configured in uplink with the parameters defined in Table 6.4.2.1-2.

  256 QAM     \%     3.5
  ----------- ------ --------------------------

##### 6.4A.2.1.2 In-band emissions

For intra-band contiguous carrier aggregation, the requirements in Table
6.4A.2.1.2-1 and 6.4A.2.1.2-2 apply within the aggregated transmission
bandwidth configuration with both component carrier (s) active and one
single contiguous PRB allocation of bandwidth at the edge of the
aggregated transmission bandwidth configuration.

The inband emission is defined as the interference falling into the non
allocated resource blocks for all component carriers. The measurement
method for the inband emissions in the component carrier with PRB
allocation is specified in annex F.3. For a non allocated component
carrier a spectral measurement is specified.

##### 6.4A.2.1.3 Carrier leakage

Carrier leakage is an additive sinusoid waveform that is confined within
the aggregated transmission bandwidth configuration. For intra-band
contiguous CA, the carrier leakage requirement is defined with
applicable frequencies dependent on parameter
*txDirectCurrentLocation-r16* or *txDirectCurrentLocation* (as defined
in TS 38.331 \[7\]). For only one uplink carrier is activated, the
applicable LO leakage frequency follow definition in clause 6.4.2.The
measurement interval is one slot in the time domain.

The relative carrier leakage power is a power ratio of the additive
sinusoid waveform and the modulated waveform. The relative carrier
leakage power shall not exceed the values specified in Table
6.4A.2.1.3-1. Carrier leakage frequencies are those that are enclosed
either in the RB containing the carrier leakage frequency, or in the two
RBs immediately adjacent to the carrier leakage frequency but excluding
any allocated RB.

Table 6.4A.2.1.3-1: Minimum requirements for Relative Carrier Leakage
Power

  Parameters                          Relative Limit (dBc)
  ----------------------------------- ----------------------
  Output power \> 10 dBm              -28
  0 dBm ≤ Output power ≤ 10 dBm       -25
  -30 dBm ≤ Output power \< 0 dBm     -20
  -40 dBm ≤ Output power \< -30 dBm   -10

#### 6.4A.2.2 Transmit modulation quality for intra-band non-contiguous CA

##### 6.4A.2.2.0 General

For intra-band non-contiguous carrier aggregation, the requirements in
subclauses 6.4A.2.2.1, 6.4A.2.2.2 applies.

The requirements in this clause apply with PCC and SCC in the UL
configured and activated: PCC with PRB allocation and SCC without PRB
allocation and without CSI reporting and SRS configured.

In case the parameter 3300 or 3301 is reported from UE via
*txDirectCurrentLocation-r16* or *txDirectCurrentLocation* (as defined
in TS 38.331 \[7\]), or UE does not indicate the DC location parameters,
carrier leakage measurement requirement in subclause 6.4A.2.2.2 shall be
waived, and the RF correction with regard to the carrier leakage and IQ
image shall be omitted during the calculation of transmit modulation
quality.

##### 6.4A.2.2.1 Error Vector Magnitude

For the intra-band non-contiguous carrier aggregation, the Error Vector
Magnitude requirement should be defined for each component carrier.
Requirements only apply with PRB allocation in one of the component
carriers. Similar transmitter impairment removal procedures are applied
for CA waveform before EVM calculation as is specified for non-CA
waveform in sub-section 6.4.2.1.

When a single component carrier is configured Table 6.4.2.1-1 apply.

The EVM requirements are according to Table 6.4A.2.2.1-1 if CA is
configured in uplink with the parameters defined in Table 6.4.2.1-2.

Table 6.4A.2.2.1-1: Minimum requirements for Error Vector Magnitude

  ----------- ------ --------------------------
  Parameter   Unit   Average EVM Level per CC
  Pi/2-BPSK   \%     30
  QPSK        \%     17.5
  16 QAM      \%     12.5
  64 QAM      \%     8
  256 QAM     \%     3.5
  ----------- ------ --------------------------

##### 6.4A.2.2.2 In-band emissions

For intra-band non-contiguous carrier aggregation the requirements for
in-band emissions are defined for each component carrier. Requirements
defined in clause 6.4A.2.1.2 only apply with PRB allocation in one of
the component carriers.

When signalling for dualPA-Architecture IE is absent, carrier leakage or
I/Q image may land inside the gap spectrum between 2 UL CCs.

For intra-band non-contiguous CA, the IQ image requirement is defined
with the applicable frequencies based on symmetry with respect to the
carrier leakage frequency, but excluding any allocated RBs.

##### 6.4A.2.2.3 Carrier leakage

For intra-band non-contiguous CA, if UE indicates
*uplinkTxDC-TwoCarrierReport-r16*, the carrier leakage requirement is
defined with applicable frequencies dependent on parameter
*txDirectCurrentLocation-r16* in *UplinkTxDirectCurrentTwoCarrierList*
IE indicated in activated uplink carrier(s), otherwise, the carrier
leakage requirement is defined with applicable frequencies dependent on
parameter *txDirectCurrentLocation* in *UplinkTxDirectCurrent* IE. The
relative carrier leakage power is a power ratio of the additive sinusoid
waveform and the modulated waveform. The relative carrier leakage power
shall not exceed the values specified in Table 6.4A.2.1.3-1. Carrier
leakage frequencies are those that are enclosed either in the RB
containing the carrier leakage frequency, or in the two RBs immediately
adjacent to the carrier leakage frequency but excluding any allocated
RB.

#### 6.4A.2.3 Transmit modulation quality for inter-band CA

For inter-band carrier aggregation with one uplink carrier assigned to
one NR band, the transmit modulation quality requirements in subclause
6.4.2 apply.

For inter-band carrier aggregation with two contiguous carriers assigned
to one NR band, the transmit modulation quality requirements in
subclause 6.4A.2.1 apply for those carriers.

For inter-band carrier aggregation with uplink assigned to two NR bands,
the transmit modulation quality requirements shall apply on each
component carrier as defined in clause 6.4.2 with all component carriers
active: PCC with PRB allocation and SCC without PRB allocation and
without CSI reporting and SRS configured.

#### 6.4A.2.4 Void

6.4B Transmit signal quality for NR-DC
--------------------------------------

For inter-band NR-DC with one uplink carrier assigned per NR band, the
transmit signal quality for the corresponding inter-band CA
configuration as specified in clause 6.4A applies.

6.4D Transmit signal quality for UL MIMO
----------------------------------------

### 6.4D.0 General

For a UE supporting UL MIMO, the requirements in this section are
defined per layer or as the sum of emissions from both antennas to
account for the UL MIMO scheme.

Alternatively, when applicable, requirements may be verified per antenna
connector using an UL MIMO transmission with codebook
of![](media/image1.wmf){width="0.6638888888888889in"
height="0.42430555555555555in"} and a configuration defined in Table
6.4D.0-1.

  ----------------------- ----------------- ------------------

### 6.4D.1 Frequency error for UL MIMO

For UE(s) supporting UL MIMO, the basic measurement interval of
modulated carrier frequency is 1 UL slot. The mean value of basic
measurements of UE modulated carrier frequency at each transmit antenna
connector shall be accurate to within ± 0.1 PPM observed over a period
of 1 ms of cumulated measurement intervals compared to the carrier
frequency received from the NR Node B.

### 6.4D.2 Transmit modulation quality for UL MIMO

#### 6.4D.2.0 General

For UE supporting UL MIMO, the transmit modulation quality requirements
are specified based on measurements made at each transmit antenna
connector.

If UE is scheduled for single antenna-port PUSCH transmission by DCI
format 0\_0 or by DCI format 0\_1 for single antenna port codebook based
transmission, the requirements in clause 6.4.2 apply.

The transmit modulation quality is specified in terms of:

\- Error Vector Magnitude (EVM) for the allocated resource blocks (RBs)

\- EVM equalizer spectrum flatness derived from the equalizer
coefficients generated by the EVM measurement process

\- Carrier leakage (caused by IQ offset)

\- In-band emissions for the non-allocated RB

In case the parameter 3300 or 3301 is reported from UE via the parameter
*txDirectCurrentLocation* in *UplinkTxDirectCurrentList* IE (as defined
in TS 38.331 \[7\]), carrier leakage measurement requirement in clause
6.4D.2.2 and 6.4D.2.3 shall be waived, and the RF correction with regard
to the carrier leakage and IQ image shall be omitted during the
calculation of transmit modulation quality.

#### 6.4D.2.1 Error Vector Magnitude

For UE with two transmit antenna connectors in closed-loop spatial
multiplexing scheme, the Error Vector Magnitude requirements specified
in clause 6.4.2.1 apply per layer. The requirements shall be met with
the UL MIMO configurations specified in Table 6.2D.1-2

#### 6.4D.2.2 Carrier leakage

For UE with two transmit antenna connectors in closed-loop spatial
multiplexing scheme, the Relative Carrier Leakage Power requirements
specified in Table 6.4.2.2-1 which is defined in clause 6.4.2.2 apply
per layer. The requirements shall be met with the UL MIMO configurations
specified in Table 6.2D.1-2

#### 6.4D.2.3 In-band emissions

For UE with two transmit antenna connectors in closed-loop spatial
multiplexing scheme, the In-band Emission requirements specified in
Table 6.4.2.3-1 which is defined in clause 6.4.2.3 apply at each
transmit antenna connector. The requirements shall be met with the
uplink MIMO configurations specified in Table 6.2D.1-2

#### 6.4D.2.4 EVM equalizer spectrum flatness for UL MIMO

For UE with two transmit antenna connectors in closed-loop spatial
multiplexing scheme, the EVM Equalizer Spectrum Flatness requirements
specified in clause 6.4.2.4 apply per layer. The requirements shall be
met with the UL MIMO configurations specified in Table 6.2D.1-2

### 6.4D.3 Time alignment error for UL MIMO

For UE(s) with multiple transmit antenna connectors supporting UL MIMO,
this requirement applies to frame timing differences between
transmissions on multiple transmit antenna connectors in the closed-loop
spatial multiplexing scheme.

The time alignment error (TAE) is defined as the average frame timing
difference between any two transmissions on different transmit antenna
connectors.

For UE(s) with multiple transmit antenna connectors, the Time Alignment
Error (TAE) shall not exceed 130 ns.

### 6.4D.4 Requirements for coherent UL MIMO

For coherent UL MIMO, Table 6.4D.4-1 lists the maximum allowable
difference between the measured relative power and phase errors between
different antenna connectors in any slot within the specified time
window from the last transmitted SRS on the same antenna connectors, for
the purpose of uplink transmission (codebook or non-codebook usage) and
those measured at that last SRS. The requirements in Table 6.4D.4-1
apply when the UL transmission power at each antenna connector is larger
than 0 dBm for SRS transmission and for the duration of time window.

Table 6.4D.4-1: Maximum allowable difference of relative phase and power
errors in a given slot compared to those measured at last SRS
transmitted

  Difference of relative phase error   Difference of relative power error   Time window
  ------------------------------------ ------------------------------------ -------------
  40 degrees                           4 dB                                 20 msec

The above requirements when all the following conditions are met within
the specified time window:

\- UE is not signaled with a change in number of SRS ports in
SRS-config, or a change in PUSCH-config

\- UE remains in DRX active time (UE does not enter DRX OFF time)

\- No measurement gap occurs

\- No instance of SRS transmission with the usage antenna switching
occurs

\- Active BWP remains the same

\- EN-DC and CA configuration is not changed for the UE (UE is not
configured or de-configured with PSCell or SCell(s))

\- When *UE is not* configured with uplink switching with parameter
*uplinkTxSwitching-r16*; or when *UE is* configured with uplink
switching with parameter *uplinkTxSwitching-r16*, and the capability
***uplinkTxSwitching***-***PUSCH-**TransCoherence is absent or indicated
as 'fullCoherent'; or* when *UE is* configured with uplink switching
with parameter *uplinkTxSwitching-r16*, the capability
***uplinkTxSwitching***-***PUSCH-**TransCoherence is indicated as
'nonCoherent', and* uplink switching is not triggered *by the* switching
mechanisms specified in sub-clause 6.1.6 of TS 38.214 \[10\] *between
last transmitted SRS and scheduled transmission.*

6.4E Transmit signal quality for V2X
------------------------------------

### 6.4E.1 Frequency error for V2X

#### 6.4E.1.1 General

The UE modulated carrier frequency for NR V2X sidelink transmissions in
Table 5.2E.1-1, shall be accurate to within ±0.1 PPM observed over a
period of 1 ms compared to the absolute frequency in case of using GNSS
synchronization source. The same requirements applied over a period of 1
ms compared to the carrier frequency received from the gNB or V2X
synchronization reference UE in case of using the gNB or V2X
synchronization reference UE sidelink synchronization signals.

For NR V2X UE supporting SL MIMO, the UE modulated carrier frequency at
each transmit antenna connector shall be accurate to within ±0.1 PPM
observed over a period of 1 ms in case of using GNSS synchronization
source. The same requirements apply over a period of 1 ms compared to
the relative frequency in case of using the NR gNode B or V2X
synchronization reference UE sidelink synchronization signals.

If the UE transmits on one antenna connector at a time, the requirements
for single carrier shall apply to the active antenna connector.

#### 6.4E.1.2 Frequency error for V2X con-current operation

For the inter-band con-current NR V2X operation, the requirements
specified in clause 6.4.1 shall apply for the uplink in licensed band
and the requirements specified in clause 6.4E.1.1 shall apply for the
sidelink in licensed band or Band n47.

### 6.4E.2 Transmit modulation quality for V2X

#### 6.4E.2.1 General

The transmit modulation quality requirements in this clause apply to V2X
sidelink transmissions.

For NR V2X UE supporting SL MIMO, the transmit modulation quality
requirements for single carrier shall apply to each transmit antenna
connector.

If V2X UE transmits on one antenna connector at a time, the requirements
specified for single carrier apply to the active antenna connector.

#### 6.4E.2.2 Error Vector Magnitude for V2X

For V2X sidelink physical channels PSCCH and PSSCH, the Error Vector
Magnitude requirements shall be as specified for PUSCH in Table
6.4.2.1-1 except pi/2-BPSK for NR V2X operating bands in Table 5.2E.1-1.
When sidelink transmissions are shortened due to transmission gap of one
symbol at the end of the slot, the EVM measurement interval is reduced
by one symbol, accordingly.

#### 6.4E.2.3 Carrier leakage for V2X

Carrier leakage of NR V2X sidelink transmission, the requirements for NR
PUSCH in Table 6.4.2.2-1 shall be applied.

#### 6.4E.2.4 In-band emissions for V2X

For V2X sidelink physical channels PSCCH, PSSCH and PSBCH, the In-band
emissions requirements shall be as specified for PUSCH in subclause
6.4.2.3 for the corresponding modulation and transmission bandwidth.
When V2X transmissions are shortened due to transmission gap of one
symbol at the end of the subframe, the In-band emissions measurement
interval is reduced by one symbol, accordingly.

#### 6.4E.2.5 EVM equalizer spectrum flatness for V2X

For V2X sidelink physical channels PSCCH, PSSCH and PSBCH, the EVM
equalizer spectrum flatness requirements shall be as specified for PUSCH
in clause 6.4.2.4 for the corresponding modulation and transmission
bandwidth.

#### 6.4E.2.6 Transmit modulation quality for V2X con-current operation

For the inter-band con-current NR V2X operation, the requirements
specified in clause 6.4.2 shall apply for the uplink in licensed band
and the requirements specified in clause 6.4E.2.1 through 6.4E.2.5 shall
apply for the sidelink in licensed band or Band n47.

6.4F Transmit signal quality for shared spectrum channel access
---------------------------------------------------------------

### 6.4F.1 Frequency error

The requirements for frequency error in clause 6.4.1 apply.

### 6.4F.2 Transmit modulation quality

#### 6.4F.2.0 General

Transmit modulation quality defines the modulation quality for expected
in-channel RF transmissions from the UE. The transmit modulation quality
is specified in terms of:

\- Error Vector Magnitude (EVM) for the allocated resource blocks (RBs)

\- EVM equalizer spectrum flatness derived from the equalizer
coefficients generated by the EVM measurement process

\- Carrier leakage

\- In-band emissions for the non-allocated RB

All the parameters defined in clause 6.4.2 are defined using the
measurement methodology specified in Annex F.

In case the parameter 3300 or 3301 is reported from UE via
*txDirectCurrentLocation* IE (as defined in TS 38.331 \[7\]), carrier
leakage measurement requirement in clause 6.4F.2.2 and 6.4F.2.3 shall be
waived, and the RF correction with regard to the carrier leakage and IQ
image shall be omitted during the calculation of transmit modulation
quality.

#### 6.4F.2.1 Error Vector Magnitude

The requirements for Error Vector Magnitude in clause 6.4.2.1 apply.

#### 6.4F.2.2 Carrier leakage

The requirements for carrier leakage in clause 6.4.2.2 apply.

#### 6.4F.2.3 In-band emissions

The in-band emission is defined as the average emission across 12
sub-carriers and as a function of the RB offset from the edge of the
allocated UL transmission bandwidth. The in-band emission is measured as
the ratio of the UE output power in a non--allocated RB to the UE output
power in an allocated RB.

The basic in-band emissions measurement interval is defined over one
slot in the time domain; however, the minimum requirement applies when
the in-band emission measurement is averaged over 10 sub-frames. When
the PUSCH or PUCCH transmission slot is shortened, the in-band emissions
measurement interval is reduced by one or more symbols, accordingly. The
requirement applies for power class 5 UE for 20 MHz channel bandwidth
and 15 kHz SCS,

Instead of the general requirement in clause 6.4.2.3, the average of the
basic in-band emission measurement over 10 sub-frames shall not exceed
the values specified in Table 6.4F.2.3-1.

#### 6.4F.2.4 EVM equalizer spectrum flatness

The requirements for EVM equalizer spectrum flatness in clause 6.4.2.4
apply.

### 6.4F.2A Transmit modulation quality for CA

#### 6.4F.2A.1 Transmit modulation quality for inter-band CA

For inter-band carrier aggregation with uplink assigned to two bands,
the transmit modulation quality requirements shall apply on the NR
carrier as defined in clause 6.4.2 and on the carrier operating with
shared spectrum access as defind in clause 6.4F.2. The requirements
apply with all component carrier active: PCC with PRB allocation and SCC
without PRB allocation and without CSI reporting and SRS configured.

6.5 Output RF spectrum emissions
--------------------------------

### 6.5.1 Occupied bandwidth

Occupied bandwidth is defined as the bandwidth containing 99 % of the
total integrated mean power of the transmitted spectrum on the assigned
channel. The occupied bandwidth for all transmission bandwidth
configurations (Resources Blocks) shall be less than the channel
bandwidth specified in Table 6.5.1-1. For UE power class 1.5 the
occupied bandwidth requirements apply to the sum of the power from both
UE antenna connectors.

### 6.5.2 Out of band emission

#### 6.5.2.1 General

The Out of band emissions are unwanted emissions immediately outside the
assigned channel bandwidth resulting from the modulation process and
non-linearity in the transmitter but excluding spurious emissions. This
out of band emission limit is specified in terms of a spectrum emission
mask and an adjacent channel leakage power ratio. For UE power class 1.5
the out-of-band emission limits apply to the sum of the power of the
out-of-band emission from both UE antenna connectors.

To improve measurement accuracy, sensitivity and efficiency, the
resolution bandwidth may be smaller than the measurement bandwidth. When
the resolution bandwidth is smaller than the measurement bandwidth, the
result should be integrated over the measurement bandwidth in order to
obtain the equivalent noise bandwidth of the measurement bandwidth.

#### 6.5.2.2 Spectrum emission mask

The spectrum emission mask of the UE applies to frequencies (Δf~OOB~)
starting from the ± edge of the assigned NR channel bandwidth. For
frequencies offset greater than Δf~OOB~, the spurious requirements in
clause 6.5.3 are applicable.

NOTE: For measurement conditions at the edge of each frequency range,
the lowest frequency of the measurement position in each frequency range
should be set at the lowest boundary of the frequency range plus MBW/2.
The highest frequency of the measurement position in each frequency
range should be set at the highest boundary of the frequency range minus
MBW/2. MBW denotes the measurement bandwidth defined for the protected
band.

The power of any UE emission shall not exceed the levels specified in
Table 6.5.2.2-1 for the specified channel bandwidth.

#### 6.5.2.3 Additional spectrum emission mask

##### 6.5.2.3.1 Requirements for network signalling value \"NS\_35\"

Additional spectrum emission requirements are signalled by the network
to indicate that the UE shall meet an additional requirement for a
specific deployment scenario as part of the cell handover/broadcast
message.

When \"NS\_35\" is indicated in the cell, the power of any UE emission
shall not exceed the levels specified in Table 6.5.2.3.1-1.

##### 6.5.2.3.2 Requirements for network signalling value \"NS\_04\"

Additional spectrum emission requirements are signalled by the network
to indicate that the UE shall meet an additional requirement for a
specific deployment scenario as part of the cell handover/broadcast
message.

The n41 SEM transition point from -13 dBm/MHz to -25 dBm/MHz is based on
the emission bandwidth. The emission bandwidth is defined as the width
of the signal between two points, one below the carrier center frequency
and one above the carrier center frequency, outside of which all
emissions are attenuated at least 26 dB below the transmitter power.
Since the 26-dB emission bandwidth is implementation dependent, the
maximum transmission bandwidths in MHz (N~RB~ \* SCS \* 12 / 1,000) is
used for the SEM.

NOTE: As a general rule, the resolution bandwidth of the measuring
equipment should be equal to the measurement bandwidth. However, to
improve measurement accuracy, sensitivity and efficiency, the resolution
bandwidth may be smaller than the measurement bandwidth. When the
resolution bandwidth is smaller than the measurement bandwidth, the
result should be integrated over the measurement bandwidth in order to
obtain the equivalent noise bandwidth of the measurement bandwidth.

#### 6.5.2.4 Adjacent channel leakage ratio

Adjacent Channel Leakage power Ratio (ACLR) is the ratio of the filtered
mean power centred on the assigned channel frequency to the filtered
mean power centred on an adjacent channel frequency.

To improve measurement accuracy, sensitivity and efficiency, the
resolution bandwidth may be smaller than the measurement bandwidth. When
the resolution bandwidth is smaller than the measurement bandwidth, the
result should be integrated over the measurement bandwidth in order to
obtain the equivalent noise bandwidth of the measurement bandwidth.

##### 6.5.2.4.1 NR ACLR

NR Adjacent Channel Leakage power Ratio (NR~ACLR~) is the ratio of the
filtered mean power centred on the assigned NR channel frequency to the
filtered mean power centred on an adjacent NR channel frequency at
nominal channel spacing.

The assigned NR channel power and adjacent NR channel power are measured
with rectangular filters with measurement bandwidths specified in
Table 6.5.2.4.1-1.

If the measured adjacent channel power is greater than --50 dBm then the
NR~ACLR~ shall be higher than the value specified in Table 6.5.2.4.1-2.

##### 6.5.2.4.2 UTRA ACLR

UTRA adjacent channel leakage power ratio (UTRA~ACLR~) is the ratio of
the filtered mean power centred on the assigned NR channel frequency to
the filtered mean power centred on an adjacent(s) UTRA channel
frequency.

UTRA~ACLR~ is specified for the first adjacent UTRA channel
(UTRA~ACLR1~) which center frequency is ± 2.5 MHz from NR channel edge
and for the 2^nd^ adjacent UTRA channel (UTRA~ACLR2~) which center
frequency is ± 7.5 MHz from NR channel edge.

The UTRA channel power is measured with a RRC filter with roll-off
factor α = 0.22 and bandwidth of 3.84 MHz. The assigned NR channel power
is measured with a rectangular filter with measurement bandwidth
specified in Table 6.5.2.4.1-1.

If the measured adjacent channel power is greater than -- 50 dBm then
the UTRA~ACLR1~ and UTRA~ACLR2~ shall be higher than the value specified
in Table 6.5.2.4.2-1.

UTRA~ACLR~ is not applicable to the power class 3 UE operating in Band
n12, n14, n17, and n30.

UTRA~ACLR~ is not applicable to the power class 1 UE operating in Band
n14.

### 6.5.3 Spurious emissions

#### 6.5.3.0 General

Spurious emissions are emissions which are caused by unwanted
transmitter effects such as harmonics emission, parasitic emissions,
intermodulation products and frequency conversion products, but exclude
out of band emissions unless otherwise stated. The spurious emission
limits are specified in terms of general requirements in line with
SM.329 \[9\] and NR operating band requirement to address UE
co-existence. For UE power class 1.5 the spurious emission limits apply
to the sum of the power of the spurious emission from both UE antenna
connectors.

To improve measurement accuracy, sensitivity and efficiency, the
resolution bandwidth may be smaller than the measurement bandwidth. When
the resolution bandwidth is smaller than the measurement bandwidth, the
result should be integrated over the measurement bandwidth in order to
obtain the equivalent noise bandwidth of the measurement bandwidth.

NOTE: For measurement conditions at the edge of each frequency range,
the lowest frequency of the measurement position in each frequency range
should be set at the lowest boundary of the frequency range plus MBW/2.
The highest frequency of the measurement position in each frequency
range should be set at the highest boundary of the frequency range minus
MBW/2. MBW denotes the measurement bandwidth defined for the protected
band.

#### 6.5.3.1 General spurious emissions

Unless otherwise stated, the spurious emission limits apply for the
frequency ranges that are more than F~OOB~ (MHz) in Table 6.5.3.1-1 from
the edge of the channel bandwidth. The spurious emission limits in Table
6.5.3.1-2 apply for all transmitter band configurations (N~RB~) and
channel bandwidths.

emission domain

NOTE: To simplify Table 6.5.3.2-1, E-UTRA band numbers are listed for
bands which are specified only for E-UTRA operation or both E-UTRA and
NR operation. NR band numbers are listed for bands which are specified
only for NR operation.

#### 6.5.3.3 Additional spurious emissions

These requirements are specified in terms of an additional spectrum
emission requirement. Additional spurious emission requirements are
signalled by the network to indicate that the UE shall meet an
additional requirement for a specific deployment scenario as part of the
cell handover/broadcast message.

##### 6.5.3.3.1 Requirement for network signalling value \"NS\_04\"

When \"NS 04\" is indicated in the cell, the power of any UE emission
shall not exceed the levels specified in Table 6.5.3.3.1-1. This
requirement also applies for the frequency ranges that are less than
F~OOB~ (MHz) in Table 6.5.3.1-1 from the edge of the channel bandwidth.

### 6.5.4 Transmit intermodulation

The transmit intermodulation performance is a measure of the capability
of the transmitter to inhibit the generation of signals in its non
linear elements caused by presence of the wanted signal and an
interfering signal reaching the transmitter via the antenna.

UE transmit intermodulation is defined by the ratio of the mean power of
the wanted signal to the mean power of the intermodulation product when
an interfering CW signal is added at a level below the wanted signal at
each transmitter antenna port with the other antenna port(s) if any
terminated. Both the wanted signal power and the intermodulation product
power are measured through NR rectangular filter with measurement
bandwidth shown in Table 6.5.4-1. For UE power class 1.5 the transmit
intermodulation requirement is specified at each antenna connector with
the wanted signal measured as the sum of the output power from both UE
antenna connectors.

The requirement of transmit intermodulation is specified in Table
6.5.4-1.

6.5A Output RF spectrum emissions for CA
----------------------------------------

### 6.5A.0 General

For inter-band carrier aggregation with one uplink carrier assigned to
one NR band, the output RF spectrum emissions requirements in clause 6.5
apply.

### 6.5A.1 Occupied bandwidth for CA

#### 6.5A.1.1 Void

#### 6.5A.1.1a Occupied bandwidth for Intra-band contiguous CA

For intra-band contiguous carrier aggregation the occupied bandwidth is
a measure of the bandwidth containing 99 % of the total integrated power
of the transmitted spectrum. The occupied bandwidth shall be less than
the aggregated channel bandwidth defined in clause 5.3A.3.

#### 6.5A.1.2 Occupied bandwidth for Intra-band non-contiguous CA

For intra-band non-contiguous carrier aggregation, the OBW requirement
is met when the ratio of the transmitted power in all sub-blocks of the
uplink CA configuration to the total integrated power of the transmitted
spectrum is greater than 99%.

#### 6.5A.1.3 Occupied bandwidth for Inter-band CA

For inter-band carrier aggregation with two contiguous carriers assigned
to one NR band, the occupied bandwidth requirements in subclause
6.5A.1.1a apply for that band.

For inter-band carrier aggregation with uplink assigned to two NR bands,
the occupied bandwidth is defined per component carrier. Occupied
bandwidth is the bandwidth containing 99 % of the total integrated mean
power of the transmitted spectrum on assigned channel bandwidth on the
component carrier. The occupied bandwidth shall be less than the channel
bandwidth specified in Table 6.5.1-1.

### 6.5A.2 Out of band emission for CA

#### 6.5A.2.1 General

This clause contains requirements for out of band emissions for UE
configured of carrier aggregation.

#### 6.5A.2.2 Spectrum emission mask

##### 6.5A.2.2.1 Spectrum emission mask for intra-band contiguous CA

For intra-band contiguous carrier aggregation the spectrum emission mask
of the UE applies to frequencies (Δf~OOB~) starting from the ± edge of
the aggregated channel bandwidth. For intra-band contiguous carrier
aggregation, the power of any UE emission shall not exceed the levels
specified in Table 6.5A.2.2.1-1 for the specified channel bandwidth.

##### 6.5A.2.2.2 Spectrum emission mask for intra-band non-contiguous CA

For intra-band non-contiguous carrier aggregation the spectrum emission
mask requirement is defined as a composite spectrum emissions mask.
Composite spectrum emission mask applies to frequencies up to ΔfOOB
starting from the edges of the sub-blocks. Composite spectrum emission
mask is defined as follows

a\) Composite spectrum emission mask is a combination of individual
sub-block spectrum emissions masks

b\) In case the sub-block consist of one component carrier the sub-lock
general spectrum emission mask is defined in subclause 6.5.2.1

c\) If for some frequency sub-block spectrum emission masks overlap then
spectrum emission mask allowing higher power spectral density applies
for that frequency

d\) If for some frequency a sub-block spectrum emission mask overlaps
with the sub-block bandwidth of another sub-block, then the emission
mask does not apply for that frequency.

##### 6.5A.2.2.3 Spectrum emission mask for Inter-band CA

For inter-band carrier aggregation with two contiguous carriers assigned
to one NR band, the spectrum emission mask requirements in subclause
6.5A.2.2.1 apply for that band.

For inter-band carrier aggregation with uplink assigned to two NR bands,
the spectrum emission mask of the UE is defined per component carrier
while both component carriers are active and the requirements are
specified in clauses 6.5.2.1 and 6.5.2.2. If for some frequency spectrum
emission masks of component carriers overlap then spectrum emission mask
allowing higher power spectral density applies for that frequency. If
for some frequency a component carrier spectrum emission mask overlaps
with the channel bandwidth of another component carrier, then the
emission mask does not apply for that frequency.

NOTE: As a general rule, the resolution bandwidth of the measuring
equipment should be equal to the measurement bandwidth. However, to
improve measurement accuracy, sensitivity and efficiency, the resolution
bandwidth may be smaller than the measurement bandwidth. When the
resolution bandwidth is smaller than the measurement bandwidth, the
result should be integrated over the measurement bandwidth in order to
obtain the equivalent noise bandwidth of the measurement bandwidth.

Leakage power Ratio(CA~ACLR~) is the ratio of the sum of the filtered
mean power centred on each assigned channel frequency to the filtered
mean power centred on an adjacent NR channel frequency at nominal
channel spacing. In case the gap bandwidth Wgap between 2 uplink CCs is

requirement is set for the gap. Each assigned NR channel power and
adjacent NR channel power are measured with rectangular filters with
measurement bandwidths specified in Table 6.5.2.4.1-1. If the measured
adjacent channel power is greater than --50dBm then the ACLR shall be

##### 6.5A.2.4.1.3 NR ACLR for Inter-band CA {#a.2.4.1.3-nr-aclr-for-inter-band-ca .H6}

For inter-band carrier aggregation with two contiguous carriers assigned
to one NR band, the NR Adjacent Channel Leakage power Ratio (NRACLR)
requirements in subclause 6.5A.2.4.1.1apply for that band.

For inter-band carrier aggregation with uplink assigned to two NR bands,
the NR Adjacent Channel Leakage power Ratio (NRACLR) is defined per
component carrier while both component carriers are active and the
requirement is specified in clause 6.5.2.4.1.

For inter-band carrier aggregation with uplink assigned to two NR bands,
the UTRA Adjacent Channel Leakage power Ratio (UTRAACLR) is defined per
component carrier while both component carrier are active and the
requirement is specified in clause 6.5.2.4.2.

### 6.5A.3 Spurious emission for CA

#### 6.5A.3.1 General spurious emissions

For inter-band carrier aggregation with uplink assigned to two NR bands,
the spurious emission requirement Table 6.5.3.1-2 apply for the
frequency ranges that are more than F~OOB~ as defined in Table 6.5.3.1-1
away from edges of the assigned channel bandwidth on a component
carrier. If for some frequency a spurious emission requirement of
individual component carrier overlaps with the spectrum emission mask or
channel bandwidth of another component carrier then it does not apply.

NOTE: For inter-band carrier aggregation with uplink assigned to two NR
bands the requirements in Table 6.5.3.1-2 could be verified by measuring
spurious emissions at the specific frequencies where second and third
order intermodulation products generated by the two transmitted carriers
can occur; in that case, the requirements for remaining applicable
frequencies in Table 6.5.3.1-2 would be considered to be verified by the
measurements verifying the one uplink inter-band CA spurious emission
requirement.

For intra-band contiguous carrier aggregation the spurious emission
limits apply for the frequency ranges that are more than FOOB (MHz) in
Table 6.5A.3.1-1 from the edge of the aggregated channel bandwidth. For
frequencies ΔfOOB greater than FOOB as specified in Table 6.5A.3.1-1 the
spurious emission requirements in Table 6.5.3.1-2 are applicable.

a\) Composite spurious emission requirement is a combination of
individual sub-block spurious emission requirements

b\) In case the sub-block consist of one component carrier the sub-lock
spurious emission requirement and FOOB are defined in subclause 6.5.3.1

c\) If for some frequency an individual sub-block spurious emission
requirement overlaps with the general spectrum emission mask or the
sub-block bandwidth of another sub-block then it does not apply

#### 6.5A.3.2 Spurious emissions for UE co-existence

##### 6.5A.3.2.1 Spurious emissions for UE co-existence for intra-band contiguous CA

This clause specifies the requirements for the specified intra-band
contiguous carrier aggregation configurations for coexistence with
protected bands, the requirements in Table 6.5A.3.2.1-1 apply.

NOTE: For measurement conditions at the edge of each frequency range,
the lowest frequency of the measurement position in each frequency range
should be set at the lowest boundary of the frequency range plus MBW/2.
The highest frequency of the measurement position in each frequency
range should be set at the highest boundary of the frequency range minus
MBW/2. MBW denotes the measurement bandwidth defined for the protected
band.

##### 6.5A.3.2.2 Spurious emissions for UE co-existence for intra-band non-contiguous CA

This clause specifies the requirements for the specified intra-band
non-contiguous carrier aggregation configurations for coexistence with
protected bands, the requirements in Table 6.5A.3.2.2-1 apply.

NOTE: For measurement conditions at the edge of each frequency range,
the lowest frequency of the measurement position in each frequency range
should be set at the lowest boundary of the frequency range plus MBW/2.
The highest frequency of the measurement position in each frequency
range should be set at the highest boundary of the frequency range minus
MBW/2. MBW denotes the measurement bandwidth defined for the protected
band.

carrier aggregation

##### 6.5A.3.2.3 Spurious emissions for UE co-existence for Inter-band CA

This clause specifies the requirements for inter-band carrier
aggregation configurations with the uplink assigned to two NR bands for
coexistence with protected bands. When both constituent bands have
common coexistence band protection requirements as specified in clause
6.5.3.2, the requirements are also applied to the carrier aggregation
configuration

For inter-band carrier aggregation with two contiguous carriers assigned
to one NR band, the requirements in subclause 6.5A.3.2.1 apply for that
band.

For inter-band carrier aggregation with the uplink assigned to two NR
bands, the requirements in Table 6.5A.3.2.3-1 apply on each component
carrier with all component carriers are active.

NOTE: For inter-band carrier aggregation with uplink assigned to two NR
bands the requirements in Table 6.5A.3.2.3-1 could be verified by
measuring spurious emissions at the specific frequencies where second
and third order intermodulation products generated by the two
transmitted carriers can occur; in that case, the requirements for
remaining applicable frequencies in Table 6.5A.3.2.3-1 would be
considered to be verified by the measurements verifying the one uplink
inter-band CA UE to UE co-existence requirements.

aggregation (two bands)

NOTE 1: As a general rule, the resolution bandwidth of the measuring
equipment should be equal to the measurement bandwidth. However, to
improve measurement accuracy, sensitivity and efficiency, the resolution
bandwidth may be smaller than the measurement bandwidth. When the
resolution bandwidth is smaller than the measurement bandwidth, the
result should be integrated over the measurement bandwidth in order to
obtain the equivalent noise bandwidth of the measurement bandwidth.

NOTE 2: Additional SEM for NR V2X overrides any other requirements in
frequency range 5855-5950MHz.

NOTE 3: The EIRP requirement is converted to conducted requirement
depend on the supported post antenna connector gain G~post\ connector~
declared by the UE following the principle described in annex I in
\[11\].

that the UE shall meet an additional requirement for a specific
deployment scenario as part of the cell handover/broadcast message.

When \"NS\_52\" is indicated in the cell or pre-configured radio
parameters, the power of any V2X UE emission shall not exceed the levels

When \"NS\_33\" is configured from pre-configured radio parameters or
the cell, and the indication from upper layers has indicated that the UE
is within the protection zone of CEN DSRC devices or HDR DSRC devices,
the power of any NR V2X UE emission shall fulfil either one of the two
sets of conditions.

Table 6.5E.3.4.2-2: Requirements for spurious emissions to protect CEN
DSRC for V2X UE

                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Maximum Transmission Power (dBm EIRP^1^)   Emission Limit in Frequency Range 5795-5815 (dBm/MHz EIRP^1^)

  NOTE 1: The EIRP requirement is converted to conducted requirement depend on the supported post antenna connector gain G~post\ connector~ declared by the UE following the principle described in annex I in \[11\].                                              

##### 6.5E.3.4.3 Void

### 6.5E.4 Transmit intermodulation

#### 6.5E.4.1 General

When UE is configured for NR V2X sidelink transmissions non-concurrent
with NR uplink transmissions for NR V2X operating bands specified in
Table 5.2E.1-1, the requirements in clause 6.5.4 apply for NR V2X
sidelink transmission.

For NR V2X UE with two transmit antenna connectors, the requirements
specified for single carrier shall apply to each transmit antenna
connector. The requirements shall be met with the SL MIMO configurations
described in clause 6.2D.1.

#### 6.5E.4.2 Transmit intermodulation for V2X con-current operation

For the inter-band con-current NR V2X operation, the requirements
specified in clause 6.5.4 shall apply for the uplink in licensed band
and the requirements specified in clause 6.5E.4.1 shall apply for the
sidelink in licensed band or Band n47.

6.5F Output RF spectrum emissions
---------------------------------

### 6.5F.1 Occupied bandwidth

The requirements for occupied bandwidth in clause 6.5.1 apply for the
specified NR-U channel bandwidths in Table 5.3.5-1.

### 6.5F.2 Out of band emission

#### 6.5F.2.1 General

The Out of band emissions are unwanted emissions immediately outside the
assigned channel bandwidth resulting from the modulation process and
non-linearity in the transmitter but excluding spurious emissions. This
out of band emission limit is specified in terms of a spectrum emission
mask and an adjacent channel leakage power ratio.

To improve measurement accuracy, sensitivity and efficiency, the
resolution bandwidth may be smaller than the measurement bandwidth. When
the resolution bandwidth is smaller than the measurement bandwidth, the
result should be integrated over the measurement bandwidth in order to
obtain the equivalent noise bandwidth of the measurement bandwidth.

#### 6.5F.2.2 Spectrum emission mask for operation with shared spectrum channel access

##### 6.5F.2.2.0 General 

Instead of the general spectrum emission mask requirement in clause
6.5.2.2, when operating with shared spectrum channel access the relative
power of any UE emission shall not exceed the levels specified in Table
6.5F.2.2-1 for the specified channel bandwidth or -30 dBm/MHz whichever
is the greatest. The spectrum emission mask for operation with shared
spectrum channel access is defined relative to the maximum power density
in a 1 MHz measurement bandwidth within the channel bandwidth.

The spectrum emission mask for operation with shared spectrum channel
access applies to frequencies (Δf~OOB~) starting from the ± edge of the
assigned channel bandwidth. For frequencies offset greater than Δf~OOB~,
the spurious requirements in clause 6.5.3 are applicable.

spectrum channel access

+---------+---------+---------+--------+--------+--------+---------+

For measurement conditions at the edge of each frequency range, the
lowest frequency of the measurement position in each frequency range
should be set at the lowest boundary of the frequency range plus MBW/2.
The highest frequency of the measurement position in each frequency
range should be set at the highest boundary of the frequency range minus
MBW/2.

##### 6.5F.2.2.1 Spectrum emission mask for non-transmitted channels

In the case of non-transmitted 20 MHz channel(s) on the edges of an
assigned channel bandwidth the spectrum emission mask for operation with
shared spectrum channel access, specified in Table 6.5F.2.2-1, is
applied by using the total bandwidth of the remaining transmitted
channels. The spectrum emission mask for non-transmitted channels is
floored at -28dBr.

The relative power of any UE emission shall not exceed the most
stringent levels given by the spectrum emission mask for operation with
shared spectrum channel access with full channel bandwidth and the
spectrum emission mask for non-transmitted channels with the channel
bandwidth of the transmitted channels in the case of non-transmitted
channels at the edge of an assigned channel bandwidth.

An exception to the spectrum emission mask for non-transmitted channels
allows a single \[2\] MHz bandwidth to extend to \[-28\] dBc relative to
total transmit power, or \[-20\] dBm, whichever is the greatest.

#### 6.5F.2.3 Additional spectrum emission mask

There are no additional spectrum emission mask requirements in this
version of the specification.

#### 6.5F.2.4 Adjacent channel leakage ratio

##### 6.5F.2.4.0 General 

Adjacent Channel Leakage power Ratio (ACLR) is the ratio of the filtered
mean power centred on the assigned channel frequency to the filtered
mean power centred on an adjacent channel frequency.

To improve measurement accuracy, sensitivity and efficiency, the
resolution bandwidth may be smaller than the measurement bandwidth. When
the resolution bandwidth is smaller than the measurement bandwidth, the
result should be integrated over the measurement bandwidth in order to
obtain the equivalent noise bandwidth of the measurement bandwidth.

##### 6.5F.2.4.1 Shared spectrum channel access ACLR

The Adjacent Channel Leakage power Ratio is the ratio of the filtered
mean power centred on the assigned channel frequency to the filtered
mean power centred on an adjacent channel frequency at nominal channel
spacing. The assigned channel power and adjacent channel power are
measured with rectangular filters with measurement bandwidths specified
in Table 6.5.2.4.1-1.

Instead of the general ACLR requirement in clause 6.5.2.4, if the
measured adjacent channel power is greater than --47 dBm then the ACLR
shall be higher than the value specified in Table 6.5F.2.4.1-1.

  ------ ---------------
  ACLR   27 dB

##### 6.5F.2.4.2 Additional requirement for network signaled value \"NS\_29\"

When \"NS\_29\" is indicated in the cell, the UE emission shall meet the
additional requirements specified in Table 6.5F.2.4.2-1 for shared
spectrum channels assigned within 5150 -- 5350 MHz and 5470 -- 5730 MHz.

### 6.5F.3 Spurious emissions

#### 6.5F.3.0 General 

Spurious emissions are emissions which are caused by unwanted
transmitter effects such as harmonics emission, parasitic emissions,
intermodulation products and frequency conversion products, but exclude
out of band emissions unless otherwise stated. The spurious emission
limits are specified in terms of general requirements in line with
SM.329 \[9\] and NR operating band requirement to address UE
co-existence.

To improve measurement accuracy, sensitivity and efficiency, the
resolution bandwidth may be smaller than the measurement bandwidth. When
the resolution bandwidth is smaller than the measurement bandwidth, the
result should be integrated over the measurement bandwidth in order to
obtain the equivalent noise bandwidth of the measurement bandwidth.

NOTE: For measurement conditions at the edge of each frequency range,
the lowest frequency of the measurement position in each frequency range
should be set at the lowest boundary of the frequency range plus MBW/2.
The highest frequency of the measurement position in each frequency
range should be set at the highest boundary of the frequency range minus
MBW/2. MBW denotes the measurement bandwidth defined for the protected
band.

#### 6.5F.3.1 General spurious emissions

The requirements for general spurious emission requirements in clause
6.5.3.1 apply.

#### 6.5F.3.2 Spurious emissions for UE co-existence

Spurious emissions requirements for UE coexistence are not applicable to
bands restricted to stand-alone operation with shared spectrum channel
access as identified in Table 5.2-1.

#### 6.5F.3.3 Additional spurious emissions

##### 6.5F.3.3.0 General 

These requirements are specified in terms of an additional spectrum
emission requirement. Additional spurious emission requirements are
signalled by the network to indicate that the UE shall meet an
additional requirement for a specific deployment scenario as part of the
cell handover/broadcast message.

##### 6.5F.3.3.1 Requirement for network signalling value \"NS\_28\"

When \"NS\_28\" is indicated in the cell, the power of any UE emission
for channels assigned within 5150-5350 and 5470-5725 MHz shall not
exceed the levels specified in Table 6.5F.3.3.1-1. This requirement also
applies for the frequency ranges that are less than F~OOB~ (MHz) in
Table 6.6.3.1-1 from the edge of the channel bandwidth.

ranges that are less than F~OOB~ (MHz) in Table 6.6.3.1-1 from the edge
of the channel bandwidth.

### 6.5F.4 Transmit intermodulation

The requirements for transmit intermodulation in clause 6.5F.4 apply.

6.6 Void
--------

6.6E Time alignment error
-------------------------

For V2X UE(s) with two transmit antenna connectors in SL MIMO, this
requirement applies to slot timing differences between transmissions on
two transmit antenna connectors.The Time Alignment Error (TAE) shall not
exceed 260 ns.

 7 Receiver characteristics
==========================

7.1 General
-----------

Unless otherwise stated the receiver characteristics are specified at
the antenna connector(s) of the UE. For UE(s) with an integral antenna
only, a reference antenna(s) with a gain of 0 dBi is assumed for each
antenna port(s). UE with an integral antenna(s) may be taken into
account by converting these power levels into field strength
requirements, assuming a 0 dBi gain antenna. For UEs with more than one
receiver antenna connector, identical interfering signals shall be
applied to each receiver antenna port if more than one of these is used
(diversity).

The levels of the test signal applied to each of the antenna connectors
shall be as defined in the respective clauses below.

The applicability of receiver requirements for *Band* n90 *is in
accordance with that for Band n41; a UE supporting Band* n90 *shall meet
the minimum requirements for Band n41.*

With the exception of clause 7.3, the requirements shall be verified
with the network signalling value NS\_01 configured (Table 6.2.3-1).

All the parameters in clause 7 are defined using the UL reference
measurement channels specified in Annexes A.2.2, the DL reference
measurement channels specified in Annex A.3.2 and using the set-up
specified in Annex C.3.1.

The minium requirements specified in clauses 7.5, 7.6, 7.7 and 7.8 for
NR band n48 refer to the minimum requirements for NR bands \< 2.7 GHz.

For the additional requirements for intra-band non-contiguous carrier
aggregation of two or more sub-blocks, an in-gap test refers to the case
when the interfering signal is located at a negative offset with respect
to the assigned lowest channel frequency of the highest sub-block and
located at a positive offset with respect to the assigned highest
channel frequency of the lowest sub-block.

For the additional requirements for intra-band non-contiguous carrier
aggregation of two or more sub-blocks, an out-of-gap test refers to the
case when the interfering signal(s) is (are) located at a positive
offset with respect to the assigned channel frequency of the highest
carrier frequency, or located at a negative offset with respect to the
assigned channel frequency of the lowest carrier frequency.

For the additional requirements for intra-band non-contiguous carrier
aggregation of two or more sub-blocks with channel bandwidth larger than
or equal to 5 MHz, the existing adjacent channel selectivity
requirements, in-band blocking requirements (for each case), and narrow
band blocking requirements apply for in-gap tests only if the
corresponding interferer frequency offsets with respect to the two
measured carriers satisfy the following condition in relation to the
sub-block gap size W~gap~ for at least one of these carriers *j* = 1,2,
so that the interferer frequency position does not change the nature of
the core requirement tested:

Wgap ≥ 2∙\|FInterferer (offset)~,*j*~\| -- BWChannel(*~j~*)

where F~Interferer\ (offset),*j*~ for a sub-block with a single
component carrier is the interferer frequency offset with respect to
carrier *j* as specified in clause 7.5, clause 7.6.2 and clause 7.6.4
for the respective requirement and BW~Channel(*j*)~ the channel
bandwidth of carrier *j*. F~Interferer\ (offset),j~ for a sub-block with
two or more contiguous component carriers is the interference frequency
offset with respect to the carrier adjacent to the gap is specified in
clause 7.5A, 7.6A.2 and 7.6A.3. The interferer frequency offsets for
adjacent channel selectivity, each in-band blocking case and narrow-
band blocking shall be tested separately with a single in-gap interferer
at a time.

For the additional requirements for operation with shared spectrum
channel access, the receiver requirements apply under the assumption
that all 20 MHz sub-bands and all RB's of each sub-band within the
downlink channel are allocated with intra-cell guard bands configured to
zero.

7.1A General
------------

The minimum requirements for band combinations including Band n41 also
apply for the corresponding band combinations with Band n90 replacing
Band n41 but with otherwise identical parameters. For brevity the said
band combinations with Band n90 are not listed in the tables below but
are covered by this specification.

The minium requirements specified in clauses 7.5A, 7.6A, 7.7A and 7.8A
for NR band n48 refer to the minimum requirements for NR bands \<
2.7 GHz.

The minium requirements specified in clauses 7.5A, 7.6A, 7.7A and 7.8A
for NR band n48 refer to the minimum requirements for NR bands \<
2.7 GHz.

7.1F General
------------

For wideband operations, the minimum requirements for the receiver
characteristics are specified when zero width intra-cell guardbands are
configured and with all RB set(s) within the channel scheduled and with
all RB sets available for DL transmissions according to the channel
access procedures in \[14\].

7.2 Diversity characteristics
-----------------------------

The UE is required to be equipped with a minimum of two Rx antenna ports
in all operating bands except for the bands n7, n38, n41, n48, n77, n78,
n79 where the UE is required to be equipped with a minimum of four Rx
antenna ports. This requirement applies when the band is used as a
standalone band or as part of a band combination.

For the single carrier REFSENS requirements in Clause 7, the UE shall be
verified with two Rx antenna ports in all supported frequency bands,
additional requirements for four Rx ports shall be verified in operating
bands where the UE is equipped with four Rx antenna ports.

For Rx requirements other than single carrier REFSENS in Clause 7, the
UE shall be verified with four Rx antenna ports and skip two Rx antenna
ports requirements in operating bands where the UE is equipped with four
Rx antenna ports, otherwise, the UE shall be verified with two Rx
antenna ports.

The above rules apply for all clauses with the exception of clause 7.9.

7.3 Reference sensitivity
-------------------------

### 7.3.1 General

The reference sensitivity power level REFSENS is the minimum mean power
applied to each one of the UE antenna ports for all UE categories, at
which the throughput shall meet or exceed the requirements for the
specified reference measurement channel.

In later clauses of Clause 7 where the value of REFSENS is used as a
reference to set the corresponding requirement:

in all bands, the UE shall be verified against those requirements by
applying the REFSENS value in Table 7.3.2-1 with 2 Rx antenna ports
tested;

for bands where the UE is required to be equipped with 4 Rx antenna
ports, the UE shall additionally be verified against those requirements
by applying the resulting REFSENS value derived from the requirement in
Table 7.3.2-2 with 4 Rx antenna ports tested.

### 7.3.2 Reference sensitivity power level

The throughput shall be ≥ 95 % of the maximum throughput of the
reference measurement channels as specified in Annexes A.2.2.2, A3.2 and
A.3.3 (with one sided dynamic OCNG Pattern OP.1 FDD/TDD for the
DL-signal as described in Annex A.5.1.1/A.5.2.1) with parameters
specified in Table 7.3.2-1 and Table 7.3.2-2.

### 7.3.3 ΔR~IB,c~

For a UE supporting CA, SUL or DC band combination, the minimum
requirement for reference sensitivity in Table 7.3.2-1 shall be
increased by the amount given by ΔR~IB,c~ defined in clause 7.3A, 7.3B,
7.3C in this specification and 7.3A, 7.3B in TS 38.101-3 \[3\] for the
applicable operating bands.

In case the UE supports more than one of band combinations for CA, SUL
or DC, and an operating band belongs to more than one band combinations
then

\- When the operating band frequency range is ≤ 1 GHz, the applicable
additional ΔR~IB,c~ shall be the average value for all band combinations
defined in clause 7.3A, 7.3B, 7.3C in this specification and 7.3A, 7.3B
in TS 38.101-3 \[3\], truncated to one decimal place that apply for that
operating band among the supported band combinations. In case there is a
harmonic relation between low band UL and high band DL, then the maximum
ΔR~IB,c~ among the different supported band combinations involving such
band shall be applied

\- When the operating band frequency range is \> 1 GHz, the applicable
additional ΔR~IB,c~ shall be the maximum value for all band combinations
defined in clause 7.3A, 7.3B, 7.3C in this specification and 7.3A, 7.3B
in TS 38.101-3 \[3\] for the applicable operating bands.

7.3A Reference sensitivity for CA
---------------------------------

### 7.3A.1 General

The reference sensitivity power level REFSENS is the minimum mean power
applied to each one of the UE antenna ports for all UE categories, at
which the throughput shall meet or exceed the requirements for the
specified reference measurement channel. For operations with 4 Rx
antenna ports, the MSD in the applicable bands shall be increased by the
absolute value of ΔR~IB,4R~ in Table 7.3.2-2 when MSD \> 0.

For reference sensitivity exception test points where the specified
carrier frequency does not correspond to a valid NR-ARFCN, the closest
NR-ARFCN as specified in clause 5.4.2 applies.

### 7.3A.2 Reference sensitivity power level for CA

#### 7.3A.2.1 Reference sensitivity power level for Intra-band contiguous CA

For intra-band contiguous carrier aggregation, the throughput of each
component carrier shall be ≥ 95 % of the maximum throughput of the
reference measurement channels as specified in Annexes A.2.2.2, A.3.2,
and A.3.3 (with one sided dynamic OCNG Pattern OP.1 FDD/TDD for the
DL-signal as described in Annex A.5.1.1/A.5.2.1) with parameters
specified in Table 7.3.2-1, Table 7.3.2-2, and Table 7.3.2-3.

For UE(s) supporting one uplink carrier, the uplink configuration of the
PCC shall be in accordance with Table 7.3.2-3 and the downlink PCC
carrier center frequency shall be configured closer to uplink operating
band than any of the downlink SCC center frequency.

For aggregation of two or more downlink FDD carriers with two uplink
carriers, the reference sensitivity is defined only for the specific
uplink and downlink test points which are specified in Table 7.3A.2.1-1
and the reference sensitivity power level increased by ΔR~IBC~. The
requirements apply with all downlink carriers active. Unless given by
Table 7.3.2-4, the reference sensitivity requirements shall be verified
with the network signaling value NS\_01 (Table 6.2.3.1-1) configured.

#### 7.3A.2.2 Reference sensitivity power level for Intra-band non-contiguous CA

For intra-band non-contiguous carrier aggregation with one uplink
carrier and two or more downlink sub-blocks, throughput of each downlink
component carrier shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the
reference measurement channels as specified in Annexes A.2.2 and A.3.2
(with one sided dynamic OCNG Pattern OP.1 FDD/TDD for the DL-signal as
described in Annex A.5.1.1/A.5.2.1) and parameters specified in Table
7.3.2-1, Table 7.3.2-2, and Table 7.3A.2.2-1 with the reference
sensitivity power level increased by ΔRIBNC given in Table 7.3A.2.2-1
for the SCC(s).

For aggregation of two or more downlink FDD carriers with one uplink
carrier the reference sensitivity is defined only for the specific
uplink and downlink test points which are specified in Table 7.3A.2.2-1.
The requirements apply with all downlink carriers active. Unless given
by Table 7.3.2-4, the reference sensitivity requirements shall be
verified with the network signalling value NS\_01 (Table 6.2.3.1-1)
configured.

#### 7.3A.2.3 Reference sensitivity power level for Inter-band CA

For inter-band carrier aggregation with one component carrier per
operating band and the uplink assigned to one NR band the throughput
shall be ≥ 95 % of the maximum throughput of the reference measurement
channels as specified in Annexes A.2.2.2, A.3.2, and A.3.3 (with one
sided dynamic OCNG Pattern OP.1 FDD/TDD for the DL-signal as described
in Annex A.5.1.1/A.5.2.1 with parameters specified in Table 7.3.2-1,
Table 7.3.2-2 and Table 7.3.2-3 modified in accordance with clause
7.3A.3.2. The reference sensitivity is defined to be met with all
downlink component carriers active and one of the uplink carriers
active. Exceptions to reference sensitivity are allowed in accordance
with clause 7.3A.4, 7.3A.5 and 7.3A.6.

For the combination of intra-band and inter-band carrier aggregation,
the intra-band CA relaxation, ΔRIBC and ΔRIBNC, are also applied
according to the clause 7.3A.2.1 and 7.3A.2.2.

#### 7.3A.2.4 Void

clause

### 7.3A.3 ΔR~IB,c~ for CA

#### 7.3A.3.1 General

For a UE supporting a CA configuration, the ΔR~IB,c~ applies for both SC
and CA operation.

#### 7.3A.3.2 ΔR~IB,c~ for Inter-band CA

For the UE which supports inter-band carrier aggregation, the minimum
requirement for reference sensitivity in clause 7.3A.2 shall be
increased by the amount given by ΔR~IB,c~ defined in clause 7.3A.3.2 for
the applicable operating bands. Unless otherwise stated, ΔR~IB,c~ is set
to zero.

In case the UE supports more than one of band combinations for CA, SUL
or DC, and an operating band belongs to more than one band combinations
then

\- When the operating band frequency range is ≤ 1 GHz, the applicable
additional ΔR~IB,c~ shall be the average value for all band combinations
defined in clause 7.3A, 7.3B, 7.3C in this specification and 7.3A, 7.3B
in TS 38.101-3 \[3\], truncated to one decimal place that apply for that
operating band among the supported band combinations. In case there is a
harmonic relation between low band UL and high band DL, then the maximum
ΔR~IB,c~ among the different supported band combinations involving such
band shall be applied

\- When the operating band frequency range is \> 1 GHz, the applicable
additional ΔR~IB,c~ shall be the maximum value for all band combinations
defined in clause 7.3A, 7.3B, 7.3C in this specification and 7.3A, 7.3B
in TS 38.101-3 \[3\] for the applicable operating bands.

### 7.3A.4 Reference sensitivity exceptions due to UL harmonic interference for CA

Sensitivity degradation is allowed for a band in frequency range 1 if it
is impacted by UL harmonic interference from another band in frequency
range 1 of the same CA configuration. Reference sensitivity exceptions
are specified in Table 7.3A.4-1 with uplink configuration specified in
Table 7.3A.4-2.

### 7.3A.5 Reference sensitivity exceptions due to intermodulation interference due to 2UL CA

For inter-band carrier aggregation with uplink assigned to two NR bands
given in Table 7.3A.5-1 and Table 7.3A.5-2 the reference sensitivity is
defined only for the specific uplink and downlink test points specified
in Table 7.3A.5-1 and Table 7.3A.5-2. For these test points the
reference sensitivity requirement specified in Table 7.3.2-1 and Table
7.3.2-2 are relaxed by the amount of the corresponding parameter MSD
given in Table 7.3A.5-1 and Table 7.3A.5-2.

### 7.3A.6 Reference sensitivity exceptions due to cross band isolation for CA

Sensitivity degradation is allowed for a band if it is impacted by UL of
another band part of the same NR CA configuration due to cross band
isolation issues. Reference sensitivity exceptions for the victim band
are specified in Table 7.3A.6-1 with uplink configuration of the
agressor band specified in Table 7.3A.6-2.

7.3B Reference sensitivity for NR-DC
------------------------------------

For inter-band NR-DC configurations, the reference sensitivity for the
corresponding inter-band CA configuration as specified in clause 7.3A
applies.

7.3C Reference sensitivity for SUL
----------------------------------

### 7.3C.1 General

The reference sensitivity power level REFSENS is the minimum mean power
applied to each one of the UE antenna ports for all UE categories, at
which the throughput shall meet or exceed the requirements for the
specified reference measurement channel. For operations with 4 Rx
antenna ports, the MSD in the applicable bands shall be increased by the
absolute value of ΔR~IB,4R~ in Table 7.3.2-2 when MSD \> 0.

### 7.3C.2 Reference sensitivity power level for SUL

For SUL operation, the reference receive sensitivity (REFSENS)
requirement for downlink bands specified in Table 7.3.2-1 and Table
7.3.2-2 shall be met for an uplink transmission bandwidth less than or
equal to that specified in Table 7.3.2-3 or supplementary uplink
transmission bandwidth less than or equal to that specified in Table
7.3C.2-1 with reference measurement channels as specified in Annexes
A.2.2.2, A.3.2, and A.3.3 (with one sided dynamic OCNG Pattern OP.1
FDD/TDD for the DL-signal as described in Annex A.5.1.1/A.5.2.1), unless
sensitivity degradation is allowed in this clause of this specification.
These exceptions also apply to any higher order CA or DC combination
containing one of the exception combinations in this clause as subset.

For SUL operation with downlink CA, the reference receive sensitivity
(REFSENS) requirement for downlink bands specified in clause 7.3A.2
shall be met for an uplink transmission bandwidth less than or equal to
that specified in Table 7.3.2-3 or supplementary uplink transmission
bandwidth less than or equal to that specified in Table 7.3C.2-1 with
reference measurement channels as specified in Annexes A.2.2.2, A.3.2,
and A.3.3 (with one sided dynamic OCNG Pattern OP.1 FDD/TDD for the
DL-signal as described in Annex A.5.1.1/A.5.2.1), unless sensitivity
degradation is allowed in this clause of this specification. These
exceptions also apply to any higher order CA or DC combination
containing one of the exception combinations in this clause as subset.

For the UE that supports any of the SUL operation given in Table
7.3C.2-2, exceptions to the requirements specified in Table 7.3.2-1are
allowed when the uplink is active in a lower frequency band and is
within a specified frequency range such that transmitter harmonics fall
within the downlink transmission bandwidth assigned in a higher band as
noted in Table 7.3C.2-2. For these exceptions, the UE shall meet the
requirements specified in Table 7.3C.2-2 and Table 7.3C.2-3.

### 7.3C.3 ΔR~IB,c~ for SUL

#### 7.3C.3.1 General

For a UE supporting a SUL configuration, the ΔR~IB,c~ applies for both
SC and SUL operation.

#### 7.3C.3.2 SUL band combination

For the UE which supports SUL band combiantion, the minimum requirement
for reference sensitivity in clause 7.3C.2 shall be increased by the
amount given in ΔR~IB,c~ defined in clause 7.3C.3.2 for the applicable
operating bands. Unless otherwise stated, ΔR~IB,c~ is set to zero.

In case the UE supports more than one of band combinations for CA, SUL
or DC, and an operating band belongs to more than one band combinations
then

\- When the operating band frequency range is ≤ 1 GHz, the applicable
additional ΔR~IB,c~ shall be the average value for all band combinations
defined in clause 7.3A, 7.3B, 7.3C in this specification and 7.3A, 7.3B
in TS 38.101-3 \[3\], truncated to one decimal place that apply for that
operating band among the supported band combinations. In case there is a
harmonic relation between low band UL and high band DL, then the maximum
ΔR~IB,c~ among the different supported band combinations involving such
band shall be applied

\- When the operating band frequency range is \> 1 GHz, the applicable
additional ΔR~IB,c~ shall be the maximum value for all band combinations
defined in clause 7.3A, 7.3B, 7.3C in this specification and 7.3A, 7.3B
in TS 38.101-3 \[3\] for the applicable operating bands.

7.3D Reference sensitivity for UL MIMO
--------------------------------------

For UE with two transmitter antenna connectors in closed-loop spatial
multiplexing scheme, the minimum requirements specified in clause 7.3
shall be met with the UL MIMO configurations described in clause 6.2D.1
and the reference measurement channels as specified in Annex A.2.2 for
CP-OFDM waveforms shall apply. For UL MIMO, the parameter P~UMAX~ is the
total transmitter power over the two transmits power over the two
transmit antenna connectors.

7.3E Reference sensitivity for V2X
----------------------------------

### 7.3E.1 General

The reference sensitivity power level P~REFSENS\_V2X~ is the minimum
mean power applied to each one of the UE antenna port for V2X UE, at
which the throughput shall meet or exceed the requirements for the
specified reference measurement channel.

### 7.3E.2 Minimum requirements

When UE is configured for NR V2X reception non-concurrent with NR uplink
transmissions for NR V2X operating bands specified in Table 5.2E.1-1,
the throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference
measurement channels as specified in Annexes A.7.2 with parameters
specified in Table 7.3E.2-1.

When UE is configured for NR V2X reception on V2X carrier con-current
with NR uplink and downlink, NR V2X sidelink throughput for the carrier
shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference measurement
channels as specified in Annexes 7.2 with parameters specified in Table
7.3E.2-3. Also the NR downlink throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum
throughput of the reference measurement channels as specified in Annexes
A.3.

For the inter-band con-current NR V2X operation, and the UE also
supports an NR downlink inter-band con-current configuration in Table
7.3E.2-4, the minimum requirement for reference sensitivity shall be
increased by the amount given in ΔR~IB,V2X~ in Table 7.3E.2-4 for the
corresponding NR V2X inter-band combinations.

7.3F Reference sensitivity for shared spectrum channel access
-------------------------------------------------------------

### 7.3F.1 General

The reference sensitivity power level REFSENS is the minimum mean power
applied to each one of the UE antenna ports, at which the throughput
shall meet or exceed the requirements for the specified reference
measurement channel.

In later clauses of Clause 7 where the value of REFSENS is used as a
reference to set the corresponding requirement, the UE shall be verified
against those requirements by applying the REFSENS value in Table
7.3G.2-1 with 2 Rx antenna ports tested.

### 7.3F.2 Reference sensitivity power level

The throughput shall be ≥ 95 % of the maximum throughput of the
reference measurement channels as specified in Annexes A.2.2.2, A.3.2
and A.3.3 (with one sided dynamic OCNG Pattern OP.1 FDD/TDD for the
DL-signal as described in Annex A.5.1.1/A.5.2.1) with parameters
specified in Table 7.3F.2-1, Table 7.3F.2-2, and Table 7.3F.2-3.

### 7.3F.3 ΔR~IB,c~

For a UE supporting CA or DC band combination, the minimum requirement
for reference sensitivity in Table 7.3F.2-1 shall be increased by the
amount given by ΔR~IB,c~ defined in Table 7.3F.3-1. Unless otherwise
stated, ΔR~IB,c~ is set to zero.

                              n48              0.5
  --------------------------- ---------------- ---------------

In case the UE supports more than one of band combinations for CA or DC,
and an operating band belongs to more than one band combinations then
the applicable additional ΔR~IB,c~ shall be the maximum value for all
band combinations defined in clause 7.3A and 7.3F.3 in this
specification and 7.3A, 7.3B in TS 38.101-3 \[3\] for the applicable
operating bands.

For intra-band contiguous carrier aggregation, the throughput of each
component carrier shall be ≥ 95 % of the maximum throughput of the
reference measurement channels as specified in Annexes A.2.2.2, A.3.2,
and A.3.3 (with one sided dynamic OCNG Pattern OP.1 FDD/TDD for the
DL-signal as described in Annex A.5.1.1/A.5.2.1) with parameters
specified in Table 7.3F.2-1, Table 7.3F.2-2, and Table 7.3F.2-3.

### 7.3F.5 Inter-band CA with shared spectrum channel access

For inter-band carrier aggregation with one component carrier per
operating band and the uplink assigned to one NR band the throughput of
the NR carrier shall be ≥ 95 % of the maximum throughput of the
reference measurement channels as specified in Annexes A.2.2.2, A.3.2,
and A.3.3 (with one sided dynamic OCNG Pattern OP.1 FDD/TDD for the
DL-signal as described in Annex A.5.1.1/A.5.2.1 with parameters
specified in Table 7.3.2-1, Table 7.3.2-2 and Table 7.3.2-3 modified in
accordance with clause 7.3F.3. The throughput of the NR-U carrier shall
be ≥ 95 % of the maximum throughput of the reference measurement
channels as specified in Annexes A.2.2.2, A.3.2, and A.3.3 (with one
sided dynamic OCNG Pattern OP.1 FDD/TDD for the DL-signal as described
in Annex A.5.1.1/A.5.2.1) with parameters specified in Table 7.3F.2-1,
Table 7.3F.2-2, and Table 7.3F.2-3 modified in accordance with clause
7.3F.3. The reference sensitivity is defined to be met with all downlink
component carriers active and the PCell uplink carrier active.
Exceptions to reference sensitivity are allowed in accordance with
clause 7.3F.5.1 and clause 7.3F.5.2.

#### 7.3F.5.1 Reference sensitivity exceptions due to UL harmonic interference

### 7.4A.2 Maximum input level for Intra-band non-contiguous CA

For intra-band non-contiguous carrier aggregation with one uplink
carrier and two or more downlink sub-blocks, each larger than or equal
to 5 MHz, the maximum input level requirements are defined with the
uplink configuration in accordance with 7.3A.2.2-1. For this uplink
configuration, the UE shall meet the requirements for each sub-block as
specified in Table 7.4-1 and Table 7.4A.1-1 for one component carrier
and two component carriers per sub-block, respectively. The throughput
of each downlink component carrier shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum
throughput of the specified reference measurement channel as specified
in Annex A.3.2 and A.3.3 (with one sided dynamic OCNG Pattern OP.1
FDD/TDD as described in Annex A.5.1.1 and A.5.2.1. The requirements
apply with all downlink carriers active.

### 7.4A.3 Maximum input level for Inter-band CA

For inter-band carrier aggregation with one component carrier per
operating band and the uplink assigned to one NR band, the maximum input
level is defined with the uplink active on the band(s) other than the
band whose downlink is being tested. For NR CA configurations including
an operating band without uplink band or an operating band with an
unpaired DL part (as noted in Table 5.2-1), the requirements for all
downlinks shall be met with the single uplink carrier active in each
band capable of UL operation. The UE shall meet the requirements
specified in clause 7.4 for each component carrier while all downlink
carriers are active.

The throughput shall be ≥ 95 % of the maximum throughput of the
reference measurement channels as specified in Annexs A.3.2 and A.3.3
(with one sided dynamic OCNG Pattern OP.1 FDD/TDD as described in Annex
A.5.1.1/A.5.2.1) for each component carrier.

7.4B Maximum input level for NR-DC
----------------------------------

For inter-band NR-DC configurations, the maximum input level for the
corresponding inter-band CA configuration as specified in clause 7.4A
applies.

7.4D Maximum input level for UL MIMO
------------------------------------

For UE with two transmitter antenna connectors in closed-loop spatial
multiplexing, the minimum requirements specified in clause 7.4 shall be
met with the UL MIMO configurations described in clause 6.2D.1. For UL
MIMO, the parameter P~CMAX\_L~ is defined as the total transmitter power
over the two transmit antenna connectors.

7.4E Maximum input level for V2X
--------------------------------

### 7.4E.1 General

Maximum input level is defined as the maximum mean power received at the
UE antenna port, at which the specified relative throughput shall meet
or exceed the minimum requirements for the specified reference
measurement channel. The throughput shall be ≥ 95 % of the maximum
throughput of the reference measurement channels as specified in Annexes
A.7.3 and A.7.4 with parameters specified in Table 7.4E.1-1.

### 7.4E.2 Maximum input level for V2X con-current operation

For the inter-band con-current NR V2X operation, the requirements
specified in clause 7.4E.1 shall apply for the NR sidelink reception in
the operating bands in Table 5.2E.2-1 and the requirements specified in
clause 7.4 shall apply for the NR downlink reception in licensed band
while all downlink carriers are active.

7.5 Adjacent channel selectivity
--------------------------------

Adjacent channel selectivity (ACS) is a measure of a receiver\'s ability
to receive an NR signal at its assigned channel frequency in the
presence of an adjacent channel signal at a given frequency offset from
the centre frequency of the assigned channel. ACS is the ratio of the
receive filter attenuation on the assigned channel frequency to the
receive filter attenuation on the adjacent channel(s).

The UE shall fulfil the minimum requirements specified in Table 7.5-1
for NR bands with FDL\_high \< 2700 MHz and FUL\_high \< 2700 MHz and
the minimum requirements specified in Table 7.5-2 for NR bands with
FDL\_low ≥ 3300 MHz and FUL\_low ≥ 3300 MHz. These requirements apply
for all values of an adjacent channel interferer up to -25 dBm and for
any SCS specified for the channel bandwidth of the wanted signal.
However, it is not possible to directly measure the ACS; instead the
lower and upper range of test parameters are chosen as in Table 7.5-3
and Table 7.5-4 for verification of the requirements specified in Table
7.5-1, and as in Table 7.5-5 and Table 7.5-6 for verification of the
requirements specified in Table 7.5-2. For these test parameters, the
throughput shall be ≥ 95 % of the maximum throughput of the reference
measurement channels as specified in Annexes A.2.2, A.3.2, and A.3.3
(with one sided dynamic OCNG Pattern OP.1 FDD/TDD for the DL-signal as
described in Annex A.5.1.1/A.5.2.1). For operating bands with an
unpaired DL part (as noted in Table 5.2-1), the requirements only apply
for carriers assigned in the paired part.

7.5A Adjacent channel selectivity for CA
----------------------------------------

### 7.5A.1 Adjacent channel selectivity for Intra-band contiguous CA

For intra-band contiguous carrier aggregation the downlink SCC(s) shall
be configured at nominal channel spacing to the PCC. The UE shall fulfil
the minimum requirement specified in Table 7.5A.1-1 and 7.5A.1-1a for an
adjacent channel interferer on either side of the aggregated downlink
signal at a specified frequency offset and for an interferer power up to
-25 dBm.

The throughput of each carrier shall be ≥ 95 % of the maximum throughput
of the reference measurement channels as specified in Annexes A.2.2,
A.3.2, and A.3.3 (with one sided dynamic OCNG Pattern OP.1 FDD/TDD for
the DL-signal as described in Annex A.5.1.1/A.5.2.1) with parameters
specified in Tables 7.5A.1-2, 7.5A.1-2a, 7.5A.1-3 and 7.5A.1-3a.

### 7.5A.2 Adjacent channel selectivity Intra-band non-contiguous CA

For intra-band non-contiguous carrier aggregation with F**~DL\_high~**
\< 2700 MHz and F**~UL\_high~** \< 2700 MHz with one uplink carrier and
two or more downlink sub-blocks, each larger than or equal to 5 MHz, the
adjacent channel selectivity requirements are defined with the uplink
configuration in accordance with Table 7.3A.2.2-1. For this uplink
configuration, the UE shall meet the requirements for each sub-block as
specified in clauses 7.5 and 7.5A.1 for one component carrier and two
component carriers per sub-block, respectively. The UE shall fulfil the
minimum requirements all values of a single adjacent channel interferer
in-gap and out-of-gap up to a --25 dBm interferer power while all
downlink carriers are active. For the lower range of test parameters
(Case 1), the interferer power Pinterferer shall be set to the maximum
of the levels given by the carriers of the respective sub-blocks as
specified in Table 7.5-3 and Table 7.5A.1-2a for one component carrier
and two component carriers per sub-block, respectively. The wanted
signal power levels for the carriers of each sub-block shall then be
adjusted relative to Pinterferer in accordance with the ACS requirement
for each sub-block (Table 7.5-1 and Table 7.5A.1-1a). For the upper
range of test parameters (Case 2) for which the interferer power
Pinterferer is -25 dBm (Table 7.5-4 and Table 7.5A.1-3a) the wanted
signal power levels for the carriers of each sub-block shall be adjusted
relative to Pinterferer like for Case 1.

For intra-band non-contiguous carrier aggregation with F**~DL\_low~** ≥
3300 MHz and F**~UL\_low~** ≥ 3300 MHz with one uplink carrier and two
or more downlink sub-blocks, each larger than or equal to 5 MHz, the
adjacent channel selectivity requirements are defined with the uplink
configuration in accordance with Table 7.3A.2.2-1. For this uplink
configuration, the UE shall meet the requirements for each sub-block as
specified in clauses 7.5 and 7.5A.1 for one component carrier and two
component carriers per sub-block, respectively. The UE shall fulfil the
minimum requirements all values of a single adjacent channel interferer
in-gap and out-of-gap up to a --25 dBm interferer power while all
downlink carriers are active. For the lower range of test parameters
(Case 1), the interferer power Pinterferer shall be set to the maximum
of the levels given by the carriers of the respective sub-blocks as
specified in Table 7.5-5 and Table 7.5A.1-2 for one component carrier
and two component carriers per sub-block, respectively. The wanted
signal power levels for the carriers of each sub-block shall then be
adjusted relative to Pinterferer in accordance with the ACS requirement
for each sub-block (Table 7.5-2 and Table 7.5A.1-1). For the upper range
of test parameters (Case 2) for which the interferer power Pinterferer
is -25 dBm (Table 7.5-6 and Table 7.5A.1-3) the wanted signal power
levels for the carriers of each sub-block shall be adjusted relative to
Pinterferer like for Case 1.

The throughput of each carrier shall be ≥ 95 % of the maximum throughput
of the reference measurement channels as specified in Annexes A.2.2,
A.3.2, and A.3.3 (with one sided dynamic OCNG Pattern OP.1 FDD/TDD for
the DL-signal as described in Annex A.5.1.1/A.5.2.1).

### 7.5A.3 Adjacent channel selectivity Inter-band CA

For inter-band carrier aggregation with one component carrier per
operating band and the uplink assigned to one NR band, the adjacent
channel requirements are defined with the uplink active on the band(s)
other than the band whose downlink is being tested. For NR CA
configurations including an operating band without uplink operation or
an operating band with an unpaired DL part (as noted in Table 5.2-1),
the requirements for all downlinks shall be met with the single uplink
carrier active in each band capable of UL operation. The UE shall meet
the requirements specified in clause 7.5 for each component carrier
while all downlink carriers are active.

The throughput of each carrier shall be ≥ 95 % of the maximum throughput
of the reference measurement channels as specified in Annexes A.2.2,
A.3.2, and A.3.3 (with one sided dynamic OCNG Pattern OP.1 FDD/TDD for
the DL-signal as described in Annex A.5.1.1/A.5.2.1).

7.5B Adjacent channel selectivity for NR-DC
-------------------------------------------

For inter-band NR-DC configurations, the adjacent channel selectivity
for the corresponding inter-band CA configuration as specified in clause
7.5A applies.

7.5D Adjacent channel selectivity for UL MIMO
---------------------------------------------

For UE(s) with two transmitter antenna connectors in closed-loop spatial
multiplexing scheme, the minimum requirements specified in clause 7.5
shall be met with the UL MIMO configurations described in clause 6.2D.1.
For UL MIMO, the parameter P~CMAX\_L~ is defined as the total
transmitter power over the two transmit antenna connectors.

7.5E Adjacent channel selectivity for V2X
-----------------------------------------

### 7.5E.1 General

Adjacent channel selectivity (ACS) is a measure of a receiver\'s ability
to receive an NR signal at its assigned channel frequency in the
presence of an adjacent channel signal at a given frequency offset from
the centre frequency of the assigned channel. ACS is the ratio of the
receive filter attenuation on the assigned channel frequency to the
receive filter attenuation on the adjacent channel(s).

The UE shall fulfil the minimum requirements specified in Table 7.5E.1-1
for NR V2X UE. These requirements apply for all values of an adjacent
channel interferer up to -25 dBm and for any SCS specified for the
channel bandwidth of the wanted signal. However, it is not possible to
directly measure the ACS; instead the lower and upper range of test
parameters are chosen as in Table 7.5E.1-2 and Table 7.5E.1-3 for
verification of the requirements specified in Table 7.5E.1-1. For these
test parameters, the throughput shall be ≥ 95 % of the maximum
throughput of the reference measurement channels as specified in Annexes
A.7.2.

In licensed band, the minimum requirements shall reuse the same ACS
values with NR UE.

### 7.5E.2 Adjacent channel selectivity for V2X con-current operation

For the inter-band con-current NR V2X operation, the requirements
specified in clause 7.5E.1 shall apply for the NR sidelink reception in
the operating bands in Table 5.2E.2-1 and the requirements specified in
clause 7.5 shall apply for the NR downlink reception in licensed band
while all downlink carriers are active.

7.5F Adjacent channel selectivity
---------------------------------

### 7.5F.1 General

Adjacent channel selectivity (ACS) is a measure of a receiver\'s ability
to receive an NR signal at its assigned channel frequency in the
presence of an adjacent channel signal at a given frequency offset from
the centre frequency of the assigned channel. ACS is the ratio of the
receive filter attenuation on the assigned channel frequency to the
receive filter attenuation on the adjacent channel(s).

Instead of the general ACS requirements specified in clause 7.5, the UE
shall fulfil the minimum requirements specified in Table 7.5F.1-1. These
requirements apply for any SCS specified for the channel bandwidth of
the wanted signal. For the test parameters specified in Table 7.5F.1-2,
the throughput shall be ≥ 95 % of the maximum throughput of the
reference measurement channels as specified in Annexes A.2.2, A.3.2, and
A.3.3 (with one sided dynamic OCNG Pattern OP.1 FDD/TDD for the
DL-signal as described in Annex A.5.1.1/A.5.2.1).

7.6 Blocking characteristics
----------------------------

### 7.6.1 General

The blocking characteristic is a measure of the receiver\'s ability to
receive a wanted signal at its assigned channel frequency in the
presence of an unwanted interferer on frequencies other than those of
the spurious response or the adjacent channels, without this unwanted
input signal causing a degradation of the performance of the receiver
beyond a specified limit. The blocking performance shall apply at all
frequencies except those at which a spurious response occurs.

For shared spectrum channel access and band combinations with operating
bands intended for shared spectrum channel access, the blocking
characteristics is specified in clause 7.6F.

### 7.6.2 In-band blocking

For NR bands with F~DL\_high~ \< 2700 MHz and F~UL\_high~ \< 2700 MHz
in-band blocking (IBB) is defined for an unwanted interfering signal
falling into the UE receive band or into the first 15 MHz below or above
the UE receive band. The throughput of the wanted signal shall be ≥ 95 %
of the maximum throughput of the reference measurement channels as
specified in Annexes A.2.2, A.3.2 and A.3.3 (with one sided dynamic OCNG
Pattern OP.1 FDD/TDD for the DL-signal as described in Annex
A.5.1.1/A.5.2.1) with parameters specified in Table 7.6.2-1 and Table
7.6.2-2. The relative throughput requirement shall be met for any SCS
specified for the channel bandwidth of the wanted signal. For operating
bands with an unpaired DL part (as noted in Table 5.2-1), the
requirements only apply for carriers assigned in the paired part.

For NR bands with F~DL\_low~ ≥ 3300 MHz and F~UL\_low~ ≥ 3300 MHz
in-band blocking (IBB) is defined for an unwanted interfering signal
falling into the UE receive band or into an immediately adjacent
frequency range up to 3\*BW~Channel~ below or above the UE receive band
where BW~Channel~ is the bandwidth of the wanted signal. The throughput
of the wanted signal shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the
reference measurement channels as specified in Annexes A.2.2, A.3.2 and
A.3.3 (with one sided dynamic OCNG Pattern OP.1 FDD/TDD for the
DL-signal as described in Annex A.5.1.1/A.5.2.1)\] with parameters
specified in Table 7.6.2-3 and Table 7.6.2-4. The relative throughput
requirement shall be met for any SCS specified for the channel bandwidth

### 7.6.3 Out-of-band blocking

For NR bands with F~DL\_high~ \< 2700 MHz and F~UL\_high~ \< 2700 MHz
out-of-band band blocking is defined for an unwanted CW interfering
signal falling outside a frequency range 15 MHz below or above the UE
receive band. The throughput of the wanted signal shall be ≥ 95% of the
maximum throughput of the reference measurement channels as specified in
Annexes A.2.2, A.3.2 and A.3.3 (with one sided dynamic OCNG Pattern OP.1
FDD/TDD for the DL-signal as described in Annex A.5.1.1/A.5.2.1) with
parameters specified in Table 7.6.3-1 and Table 7.6.3-2. The relative
throughput requirement shall be met for any SCS specified for the
channel bandwidth of the wanted signal. For operating bands with an
unpaired DL part (as noted in Table 5.2-1), the requirements only apply
for carriers assigned in the paired part.

For interferer frequencies across ranges 1, 2 and 3 in Table 7.6.3-2, a
maximum of

exceptions are allowed for spurious response frequencies in each
assigned frequency channel when measured using a step size of MHz
withthe number of resource blocks in the downlink transmission bandwidth
configuration, BW~Channel~ the bandwidth of the frequency channel in MHz
and *n* = 1, 2, 3 for SCS = 15, 30, 60 kHz, respectively. For these
exceptions, the requirements in clause 7.7 apply.

For NR bands with F~DL\_low~ ≥ 3300 MHz and F~UL\_low~ ≥ 3300 MHz
out-of-band band blocking is defined for an unwanted CW interfering
signal falling outside a frequency range up to 3\*BW~Channel~ below or
from 3\*BW~Channel~ above the UE receive band, where BW~Channel~ is the
channel bandwidth. The throughput of the wanted signal shall be ≥ 95 %
of the maximum throughput of the reference measurement channels as
specified in Annexes A.2.2, A.3.2 and A.3.3 (with one sided dynamic OCNG
Pattern OP.1 FDD/TDD for the DL-signal as described in Annex
A.5.1.1/A.5.2.1) with parameters specified in Table 7.6.3-3 and Table
7.6.3-4. The relative throughput requirement shall be met for any SCS
specified for the channel bandwidth of the wanted signal.

For interferer frequencies across ranges 1, 2 and 3 in Table 7.6.3-4, a
maximum of

exceptions are allowed for spurious response frequencies in each
assigned frequency channel when measured using a step size of MHz
withthe number of resource blocks in the downlink transmission bandwidth
configuration, BW~Channel~ the bandwidth of the frequency channel in MHz
and *n* = 1, 2, 3 for SCS = 15, 30, 60 kHz, respectively. For these
exceptions, the requirements in clause 7.7 apply.

### 

### 7.6.4 Narrow band blocking

This requirement is measure of a receiver\'s ability to receive a NR
signal at its assigned channel frequency in the presence of an unwanted
narrow band CW interferer at a frequency, which is less than the nominal
channel spacing.

The relative throughput shall be ≥ 95 % of the maximum throughput of the
reference measurement channels as specified in Annexes A.2.2, A.3.2 and
A.3.3 (with one sided dynamic OCNG Pattern OP.1 FDD/TDD for the
DL-signal as described in Annex A.5.1.1/A.5.2.1) with parameters
specified in Table 7.6.4-1. For operating bands with an unpaired DL part
(as noted in Table 5.2-1), the requirements only apply for carriers
assigned in the paired part.

#### 7.6A.2.1 In-band blocking for Intra-band contiguous CA

For intra-band contiguous carrier aggregation the downlink SCC(s) shall
be configured at nominal channel spacing to the PCC. The UE shall fulfil
the minimum requirement specified in Table 7.6A.2.1-1 and 7.6A.2.1-1a
for an adjacent channel interferer on either side of the aggregated
downlink signal at a specified frequency offset and for an interferer
power up to -25 dBm. The throughput of each carrier shall be ≥ 95% of
the maximum throughput of the reference measurement channels as
specified in Annexes A.2.2, A.3.2, and A.3.3 (with one sided dynamic
OCNG Pattern OP.1 FDD/TDD for the DL-signal as described in Annex
A.5.1.1/A.5.2.1).

D/TDD for the DL-signal as described in Annex A.5.1.1/A.5.2.1).

#### 7.6A.2.2 In-band blocking for Intra-band non-contiguous CA

For intra-band non-contiguous carrier aggregation with one uplink
carrier and two or more downlink sub-blocks, each larger than or equal
to 5 MHz, the in-band blocking requirements are defined with the uplink
configuration in accordance with Table 7.3A.2.2-1. For this uplink
configuration, the UE shall meet the requirements for each sub-block as
specified in clause 7.6.2 and 7.6A.2.1 for one component carrier and two
component carriers per sub-block, respectively. The requirements apply
for in-gap and out-of-gap interferers while all downlink carriers are
active.

The throughput of each carrier shall be ≥ 95 % of the maximum throughput
of the reference measurement channels as specified in Annexes A.2.2,
A.3.2, and A.3.3 (with one sided dynamic OCNG Pattern OP.1 FDD/TDD for
the DL-signal as described in Annex A.5.1.1/A.5.2.1).

#### 7.6A.2.3 In-band blocking for Inter-band CA

For inter-band carrier aggregation with one component carrier per
operating band and the uplink assigned to one NR band, the in-band
blocking requirements are defined with the uplink active on the band(s)
other than the band whose downlink is being tested. The UE shall meet
the requirements specified in clause 7.6.2 for each component carrier
while all downlink carriers are active.

For the UE which supports inter-band CA configuration in Table 7.3A.3.2,
P~interferer~ power defined in Table 7.6.2-2 and 7.6.2-4 is increased by
the amount given by ΔR~IB,c~ in Table 7.3A.3.2.

For NR CA configurations including an operating band without uplink
operation or an operating band with an unpaired DL part (as noted in
Table 5.2-1), the requirements for all downlinks shall be met with the
single uplink carrier active in each band capable of UL operation. The
requirements for the component carrier configured in the operating band
without uplink operation are specified in clause 7.6.2 while all
downlink carriers are active.

Table 7.6A.2.3-1: Void

The throughput of each carrier shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput
of the reference measurement channels as specified in Annexes A.2.2,
A.3.2, and A.3.3 (with one sided dynamic OCNG Pattern OP.1 FDD/TDD for
the DL-signal as described in Annex A.5.1.1/A.5.2.1).

### 7.6A.3 Out-of-band blocking for CA

#### 7.6A.3.1 Out-of-band blocking for Intra-band contiguous CA

For intra-band contiguous carrier aggreagation the downlink SCC(s) shall
be configured at nominal channel spacing to the PCC. For FDD, the PCC
shall be configured closest to the uplink band. All downlink carriers
shall be active throughout the test.

The UE shall fulfil the minimum requirement in presence of an
interfering signal specified in Table 7.6A.3-1 and Table 7.6A.3-2 being
on either side of the aggregated signal. The throughput of each carrier
shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference measurement
channels as specified in Annexes A.2.2, A.3.2, and A.3.3 (with one sided
dynamic OCNG Pattern OP.1 FDD/TDD for the DL-signal as described in
Annex A.5.1.1/A.5.2.1).

Table 7.6A.3-2a: Void

For interferer frequencies across ranges 1, 2 and 3 in Table 7.6A.3-2, a
maximum of

exceptions are allowed for spurious response frequencies in each
assigned frequency channel when measured using a step size of MHz with
the number of resource blocks in the downlink transmission bandwidth
configuration, BW~Channel~ is the bandwidth of the frequency channel in
MHz and *n* = 1, 2, 3 for SCS = 15, 30, 60 kHz, respectively. For these
exceptions, the requirements in subclause 7.7A.1 apply.

#### 7.6A.3.2 Out-of-band blocking for Intra-band non-contiguous CA

For intra-band non-contiguous carrier aggregation with one uplink
carrier and two or more downlink sub-blocks, the out-of-band blocking
requirements are defined with the uplink configuration in accordance
with table 7.3A.2.2-1. For this uplink configuration, the UE shall meet
the requirements for each sub-block as specified in clauses 7.6.3 and
7.6A.3.1 for one component carrier and two component carriers per
sub-block, respectively. The requirements apply with all downlink
carriers active.

The throughput of each carrier shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput
of the reference measurement channels as specified in Annexes A.2.2,
A.3.2, and A.3.3 (with one sided dynamic OCNG Pattern OP.1 FDD/TDD for
the DL-signal as described in Annex A.5.1.1/A.5.2.1).

#### 7.6A.3.3 Out-of-band blocking for Inter-band CA

For inter-band carrier aggregation with one component carrier per
operating band and the uplink assigned to one NR band, the out-of-band
blocking requirements are defined with the uplink active on the band(s)
other than the band whose downlink is being tested. For NR CA
configurations including an operating band without uplink band or an
operating band with an unpaired DL part (as noted in Table 5.2-1), the
requirements for all downlinks shall be met with the single uplink
carrier active in each band capable of UL operation. The UE shall meet
the requirements specified in clause 7.6.3 for each component carrier
while all downlink carriers are active.

For inter-band carrier aggregation with component carriers in operating
bands \< 2.7GHz including n48, and for F~DL\_Low(*j*)~ -- 15 MHz ≤ f ≤
F~DL\_High(*j*)~ + 15 MHz, the appropriate adjacent channel selectivity
and in-band blocking requirements in the respective clauses 7.5 and
7.6.2 shall be applied for carrier *j*. For inter-band carrier
aggregation with component carriers in operating bands \> 2.7GHz
excluding n48, and for F~DL\_Low(*j*)~ -- 3\* BW~channel~ ≤ f ≤
F~DL\_High(*j*)~ + 3\* BW~channel~, the appropriate adjacent channel
selectivity and in-band blocking requirements in the respective clauses
7.5 and 7.6.2 shall be applied for carrier *j*. F~DL\_Low(*j*)~ and
F~DL\_High(*j*)~ denote the respective lower and upper frequency limits
of the operating band containing carrier *j*, *j* = 1,...,X, with
carriers numbered in increasing order of carrier frequency and X the
number of component carriers in the band combination. BW~channel~
denotes the channel bandwidth of the wanted signal component carrier j.
If CW interferer falls in a gap between F~DL\_High(*j*)~ and
F~DL\_Low(*j*+1)~ where the corresponding OOB ranges 1 and 2 overlap,
then the lower level interferer limit of the overlapping OOB ranges
applies.

If F~DL\_high~ of the lower NR band is greater than or equal to the
F~DL\_low~ of the another upper NR band as in overlapping RX frequency
ranges, then the OOB range shall start from the F~DL\_low~ of the lower
NR band, and from the F~DL\_high~ of the upper NR band.

For inter-band carrier aggregation with uplink assigned to two NR bands,
the out-of-band blocking requirements specified in clause 7.6.3 shall be
met with the transmitter power for the uplink set to 7 dB below
P~CMAX\_L,f,c~ for each serving cell c.

For the UE which supports inter-band CA configuration in Table
7.3A.3.2.1-1, P~interferer~ power defined in Table 7.6.3-2 and 7.6.3-4
is increased by the amount given by ΔR~IB,c~ in Table 7.3A.3.2.1-1.

For inter-band CA combination listed in Table 7.6A.3.3-1, exceptions to
the requirement specified in Table 7.6A.3.3-2 are allowed when the
second order intermodulation product of the lower frequency band UL
carrier and the CW interfering signal fully or partially overlaps with
the higher frequency band DL carrier.

  NOTE 1: The requirement applies when $\left| f_{\text{Interferer}} \pm \ f_{\text{UL}}^{\text{LB}} - \ f_{\text{DL}}^{\text{HB}} \right| \leq (\text{BW}_{\text{UL}}^{\text{LB}} + \ \text{BW}_{\text{DL}}^{\text{HB}})/2$, where $f_{\text{UL}}^{\text{LB}}$ and $f_{\text{DL}}^{\text{HB}}$ are the carrier frequencies for lower frequency band UL and higher frequency band DL, respectively. $\text{BW}_{\text{UL}}^{\text{LB}}\ $and $\text{BW}_{\text{DL}}^{\text{HB}}\ $are the channel bandwidths configured for lower frequency band UL carrier and higher frequency band DL carrier in MHz, respectively.          

For all interferer frequency ranges specified in clause 7.6.3 a maximum
of

exceptions are allowed for spurious response frequencies in each
assigned frequency channel when measured using a step size of MHz with
*N~RB~* the number of resource blocks in the downlink transmission
bandwidth configuration, BW~Channel~ the bandwidth of the frequency
channel in MHz and n = 1, 2, 3 for SCS = 15, 30, 60 kHz, respectively.
For these exceptions, the requirements in clause 7.7 apply.

The throughput of each carrier shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput
of the reference measurement channels as specified in Annexes A.2.2,
A.3.2, and A.3.3 (with one sided dynamic OCNG Pattern OP.1 FDD/TDD for
the DL-signal as described in Annex A.5.1.1/A.5.2.1).

### 7.6A.4 Narrow band blocking for CA

#### 7.6A.4.1 Narrow band blocking for Intra-band contiguous CA

For intra-band contiguous carrier aggregation, the downlink SCC(s) shall
be configured at nominal channel spacing to the PCC. For FDD, the PCC
shall be configured closest to the uplink band. All downlink carriers
shall be active throughout the test. The uplink output power shall be
set as specified in Table 7.6A.4.1-1 with the uplink configuration. For
UE(s) supporting one uplink, the uplink configuration of the PCC shall
be in accordance with Table 7.3.2-3. The UE shall fulfil the minimum
requirement in presence of an interfering signal specified in Table
7.6A.4.1-1 being on either side of the aggregated signal. The throughput
of each carrier shall be ≥ 95 % of the maximum throughput of the
reference measurement channels as specified in Annexes A.2.2, A3.2 and
A.3.3 (with one sided dynamic OCNG Pattern OP.1 FDD/TDD for the
DL-signal as described in Annex A.5.1.1/A.5.2.1) with parameters
specified in Table 7.6A.4.1-1.

#### 7.6A.4.2 Narrow band blocking for Intra-band non-contiguous CA

For intra-band non-contiguous carrier aggregation with F**~DL\_low~** \<
2700 MHz and F**~UL\_low~** \< 2700 MHz with one uplink carrier and two
or more downlink sub-blocks, the narrow band blocking requirements are
defined with the uplink configuration in accordance with Table
7.3A.2.2-1. For this uplink configuration, the UE shall meet the
requirements for each sub-block as specified in clauses 7.6.4 and
7.6A.4.1 for one component carrier and two component carriers per
sub-block, respectively. The requirements apply for in-gap and
out-of-gap interferers while all downlink carriers are active.

The throughput of each carrier shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput
of the reference measurement channels as specified in Annexes A.2.2,
A.3.2, and A.3.3 (with one sided dynamic OCNG Pattern OP.1 FDD/TDD for
the DL-signal as described in Annex A.5.1.1/A.5.2.1).

#### 7.6A.4.3 Narrow band blocking for Inter-band CA

For inter-band carrier aggregation with one component carrier per
operating band and the uplink assigned to one NR band, the narrow band
blocking requirements are defined with the uplink active on the band(s)
other than the band whose downlink is being tested. For NR CA
configurations including an operating band without uplink band or an
operating band with an unpaired DL part (as noted in Table 5.2-1), the
requirements for all downlinks shall be met with the single uplink
carrier active in each band capable of UL operation. The UE shall meet
the requirements specified in clause 7.6.4 for each component carrier
while all downlink carriers are active.

For the UE which supports inter-band CA configuration in Table
7.3A.3.2.1-1, P~UW~ power defined in Table 7.6.4-1 is increased by the
amount given by ΔR~IB,c~ in Table 7.3A.3.2.1-1.

The throughput of each carrier shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput
of the reference measurement channels as specified in Annexes A.2.2,
A.3.2, and A.3.3 (with one sided dynamic OCNG Pattern OP.1 FDD/TDD for
the DL-signal as described in Annex A.5.1.1/A.5.2.1).

7.6B Blocking characteristics for NR-DC
---------------------------------------

For inter-band NR-DC configurations, the blocking characterstics for the
corresponding inter-band CA configuration as specified in clause 7.6A
applies.

7.6C Blocking characteristics for SUL
-------------------------------------

### 7.6C.1 General

### 7.6C.2 In-band blocking for SUL

For SUL operation, the in-band blocking requirement for downlink bands
specified in clause 7.6.2 shall be met.

For SUL operation with downlink CA, the in-band blocking requirement for
downlink bands specified in clause 7.6A.2 shall be met.

### 7.6C.3 Out-of-band blocking for SUL

For SUL operation, the out-of-band blocking requirement for downlink
bands specified in clause 7.6.3 shall be met. For SUL operation with
downlink CA, the out-of-band blocking requirement for downlink bands
specified in clause 7.6A.3 shall be met. For operation band combination
listed in Table 7.6C.3-1, exceptions to the requirement specified in
Table 7.6C.3-2 are allowed when the second order intermodulation product
of the SUL carrier and the CW interfering signal fully or partially
overlaps with the DL carrier.

  NOTE 1: The requirement applies when$\ |f_{\text{Interferer}} \pm \ f_{\text{SUL}} - \ f_{\text{DL}}| \leq (\text{BW}_{\text{SUL}} + \ \text{BW}_{\text{DL}})/2$, where $\text{BW}_{\text{SUL}}\ $and $\text{BW}_{\text{DL}}\ $are the channel bandwidths configured for SUL and DL (victim) bands in MHz, respectively.          
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------ --------

For all interferer frequency ranges specified in clause 7.6.3 a maximum
of

exceptions are allowed for spurious response frequencies in each
assigned frequency channel when measured using a step size of MHz with
*N~RB~* the number of resource blocks in the downlink transmission
bandwidth configuration, BW~Channel~ the bandwidth of the frequency
channel in MHz and *n* = 1, 2, 3 for SCS = 15, 30, 60 kHz, respectively.
For these exceptions, the requirements in clause 7.7 apply.

### 7.6C.4 Narrow band blocking for SUL

Narrow band blocking is not specified for SUL band combination.

7.6D Blocking characteristics for UL MIMO
-----------------------------------------

For UE with two transmitter antenna connectors in closed-loop spatial
multiplexing scheme, the minimum requirements specified in clause 7.6
shall be met with the UL MIMO configurations described in clause 6.2D.1.
For UL MIMO, the parameter P~CMAX\_L~ is defined as the total
transmitter power over the two transmit antenna connectors.

7.6E Blocking characteristics for V2X
-------------------------------------

### 7.6E.1 General

The blocking characteristic is a measure of the receiver\'s ability to
receive a wanted signal at its assigned channel frequency in the
presence of an unwanted interferer on frequencies other than those of
the spurious response or the adjacent channels, without this unwanted
input signal causing a degradation of the performance of the receiver
beyond a specified limit. The blocking performance shall apply at all
frequencies except those at which a spurious response occurs.

### 7.6E.2 In-band blocking

#### 7.6E.2.1 General

The throughput of the wanted signal shall be ≥ 95 % of the maximum
throughput of the reference measurement channels as specified in Annex
A.7.2 with parameters specified in Table 7.6E.2.1-1 and Table
7.6E.2.1-2. The relative throughput requirement shall be met for any SCS
specified for the channel bandwidth of the wanted signal.

For the inter-band con-current NR V2X operation, the requirements
specified in clause 7.6E.2.1 shall apply for the NR sidelink reception
in the operating bands in Table 5.2E.2-1 and the requirements specified
in clause 7.6.2 shall apply for the NR downlink reception in licensed
band while all downlink carriers are active.

### 7.6E.3 Out-of-band blocking

#### 7.6E.3.1 General

For NR V2X bands out-of-band band blocking is defined for an unwanted CW
interfering signal falling outside a frequency range 30 MHz below or
above the UE receive band. The throughput of the wanted signal shall be
≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference measurement channels as
specified in Annexes A.7.2 with parameters specified in Table 7.6E.3.1-1
and Table 7.6E.3.1-2. The relative throughput requirement shall be met
for any SCS specified for the channel bandwidth of the wanted signal.

#### 7.6E.3.2 Out-of-band blocking for V2X con-current operation

For the inter-band con-current NR V2X operation, the requirements
specified in clause 7.6E.3.1 shall apply for the NR sidelink reception
in Band n47 and the requirements specified in clause 7.6.3 shall apply
for the NR downlink reception in licensed band while all downlink
carriers are active.

7.6F Blocking characteristics
-----------------------------

### 7.6F.1 General

The blocking characteristic is a measure of the receiver\'s ability to
receive a wanted signal at its assigned channel frequency in the
presence of an unwanted interferer on frequencies other than those of
the spurious response or the adjacent channels, without this unwanted
input signal causing a degradation of the performance of the receiver
beyond a specified limit. The blocking performance shall apply at all
frequencies except those at which a spurious response occurs.

### 7.6F.2 In-band blocking

#### 7.6F.2.1 General

In-band blocking (IBB) is defined for an unwanted interfering signal
falling into the UE receive band or into the first 60 MHz below or above
the UE receive band. The throughput of the wanted signal shall be ≥ 95 %
of the maximum throughput of the reference measurement channels as
specified in Annexes A.2.2, A.3.2 and A.3.3 (with one sided dynamic OCNG
Pattern OP.1 FDD/TDD for the DL-signal as described in Annex
A.5.1.1/A.5.2.1) with parameters specified in Table 7.6F.2.1-1 and Table
7.6F.2.1-2. The relative throughput requirement shall be met for any SCS
specified for the channel bandwidth of the wanted signal.

#### 7.6F.2.2 Intra-band contiguous shared spectrum channel access CA

In-band blocking for intra-band contiguous shared access CA requirements
are specified in Table 7.6F.2.2-1. These requirements apply for any SCS
specified for the channel bandwidth of the wanted signal. For the test
parameters specified in Table 7.6F.2.2-2, the throughput of each carrier
shall be ≥ 95 % of the maximum throughput of the reference measurement
channels as specified in Annexes A.2.2, A.3.2, and A.3.3 (with one sided
dynamic OCNG Pattern OP.1 FDD/TDD for the DL-signal as described in
Annex A.5.1.1/A.5.2.1).

### 7.6F.3 Out-of-band blocking

#### 7.6F.3.1 General

ut-of-band band blocking is defined for an unwanted CW interfering
signal falling outside a frequency range 60 MHz or greater below or
above the UE receive band. The throughput of the wanted signal shall be
≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference measurement channels as
specified in Annexes A.2.2, A.3.2 and A.3.3 (with one sided dynamic OCNG
Pattern OP.1 FDD/TDD for the DL-signal as described in Annex
A.5.1.1/A.5.2.1) with parameters specified in Table 7.6F.3.1-1 and Table
7.6F.3.1-2. The relative throughput requirement shall be met for any SCS
specified for the channel bandwidth of the wanted signal.

For interferer frequencies across ranges 1, 2 and 3 in Table 7.6F.3-2, a
maximum of

exceptions are allowed for spurious response frequencies in each
assigned frequency channel when measured using a step size of MHz
withthe number of resource blocks in the downlink transmission bandwidth
configuration, *CBW* the bandwidth of the frequency channel in MHz and
*n* = 1, 2, 3 for SCS = 15, 30, 60 kHz, respectively. For these
exceptions, the requirements in clause 7.7F apply.

#### 7.6F.3.2 Intra-band contiguous shared spectrum channel access CA

Out-of-band blocking for intra-band contiguous shared access CA
requirements are specified in Table 7.6F.3.2-1. These requirements apply
for any SCS specified for the channel bandwidth of the wanted signal.
For the test parameters specified in Table 7.6F.3.2-2, the throughput of
each carrier shall be ≥ 95 % of the maximum throughput of the reference
measurement channels as specified in Annexes A.2.2, A.3.2, and A.3.3
(with one sided dynamic OCNG Pattern OP.1 FDD/TDD for the DL-signal as
described in Annex A.5.1.1/A.5.2.1).

7.7 Spurious response
---------------------

Spurious response is a measure of the ability of the receiver to receive
a wanted signal on its assigned channel frequency without exceeding a
given degradation due to the presence of an unwanted CW interfering
signal at any other frequency for which a response is obtained, i.e. for
which the out-of-band blocking limit as specified in clause 7.6.3 is not
met.

The throughput shall be ≥ 95 % of the maximum throughput of the
reference measurement channels as specified in Annexes A.2.2, A.3.2 and
A.3.3 (with one sided dynamic OCNG Pattern OP.1 FDD/TDD for the
DL-signal as described in Annex A.5.1.1/A.5.2.1) with parameters for the
wanted signal as specified in Table 7.7-1 for NR bands with F~DL\_high~
\< 2700 MHz and F~UL\_high~ \< 2700 MHz and in Table 7.7-1a for NR bands
with F~DL\_high~ ≥ 3300 MHz and F~UL\_high~ ≥ 3300 MHz and for the
interferer as specified in Table 7.7-2. The relative throughput
requirement shall be met for any SCS specified for the channel bandwidth
of the wanted signal. For operating bands with an unpaired DL part (as
noted in Table 5.2-1), the requirements only apply for carriers assigned
in the paired part.

### 7.7A.2 Spurious response for Intra-band non-contiguous CA

For intra-band non-contiguous carrier aggregation with one uplink
carrier and two or more downlink sub-blocks, the spurious response
requirements are defined with the uplink configuration in accordance
with Table 7.3A.2.2-1. For this uplink configuration, the UE shall meet
the requirements for each sub-block as specified in clauses 7.7 and
7.7A.1 for one component carrier and two component carriers per
sub-block, respectively. The requirements apply with all downlink
carriers active.

The throughput of each carrier shall be ≥ 95 % of the maximum throughput
of the reference measurement channels as specified in Annexes A.2.2,
A.3.2, and A.3.3 (with one sided dynamic OCNG Pattern OP.1 FDD/TDD for
the DL-signal as described in Annex A.5.1.1/A.5.2.1).

### 7.7A.3 Spurious response for Inter-band CA

For inter-band carrier aggregation with one component carrier per
operating band and the uplink assigned to one NR band, the spurious
response are defined with the uplink active on the band(s) other than
the band whose downlink is being tested. The UE shall meet the
requirements specified in clause 7.7 for each component carrier while
all downlink carriers are active.

For the UE which supports inter-band CA configuration in Table
7.3A.3.2.1-1, P~interferer~ power defined in Table 7.7-2 is increased by
the amount given by ΔR~IB,c~ in Table 7.3A.3.2.1-1.

The throughput of each carrier shall be ≥ 95 % of the maximum throughput
of the reference measurement channels as specified in Annexes A.2.2,
A.3.2, and A.3.3 (with one sided dynamic OCNG Pattern OP.1 FDD/TDD for
the DL-signal as described in Annex A.5.1.1/A.5.2.1).

7.7B Spurious response for NR-DC
--------------------------------

For inter-band NR-DC configurations, the spurious response for the
corresponding inter-band CA configuration as specified in clause 7.7A
applies.

7.7D Spurious response for UL MIMO
----------------------------------

For UE with two transmitter antenna connectors in closed-loop spatial
multiplexing scheme, the minimum requirements specified in clause 7.7
shall be met with the UL MIMO configurations described in clause 6.2D.1.
For UL MIMO, the parameter P~CMAX\_L~ is defined as the total
transmitter power over the two transmit antenna connectors.

7.7E Spurious response for V2X
------------------------------

### 7.7E.1 General

Spurious response is a measure of the receiver's ability to receive a
wanted signal on its assigned channel frequency without exceeding a
given degradation due to the presence of an unwanted CW interfering
signal at any other frequency for which a response is obtained, i.e. for
which the out-of-band blocking limit as specified in clause 7.6E.3.1 is
not met.

The throughput shall be ≥ 95 % of the maximum throughput of the
reference measurement channels as specified in Annexes A.7.2 with
parameters for the wanted signal as specified in Table 7.7E.1-1 and
Table 7.7E.1-2 for NR V2X bands. The relative throughput requirement
shall be met for any SCS specified for the channel bandwidth of the
wanted signal.

7.8 Intermodulation characteristics
-----------------------------------

### 7.8.1 General

Intermodulation response rejection is a measure of the capability of the
receiver to receive a wanted signal on its assigned channel frequency in
the presence of two or more interfering signals which have a specific
frequency relationship to the wanted signal

### 7.8.2 Wide band Intermodulation

The wide band intermodulation requirement is defined using a CW carrier
and modulated NR signal as interferer 1 and interferer 2 respectively.

The throughput shall be ≥ 95 % of the maximum throughput of the
reference measurement channels as specified in Annexes A.2.2, A.3.2 and
A.3.3 (with one sided dynamic OCNG Pattern OP.1 FDD/TDD for the
DL-signal as described in Annex A.5.1.1/A.5.2.1) with parameters
specified in Table 7.8.2-1 for NR bands with F~DL\_high~ \< 2700 MHz and
F~UL\_high~ \< 2700 MHz and Table 7.8.2-2 for NR bands with F~DL\_low~ ≥
3300 MHz and F~UL\_low~ ≥ 3300 MHz. The relative throughput requirement
shall be met for any SCS specified for the channel bandwidth of the
wanted signal. For operating bands with an unpaired DL part (as noted in
Table 5.2-1), the requirements only apply for carriers assigned in the
paired part.

#### 7.8A.2.2 Wide band intermodulation for Intra-band non-contiguous CA

For intra-band non-contiguous carrier aggregation with one uplink
carrier and two or more downlink sub-blocks, the wide band
intermodulation requirements are defined with the uplink configuration
in accordance with Table 7.3A.2.2-1. For this uplink configuration, the
UE shall meet the requirements for each sub-block as specified in clause
7.8.2 and 7.8A.2.1 for one component carrier and two component carriers
per sub-block, respectively. The requirements apply for out-of-gap
interferers while all downlink carriers are active.

The throughput of each carrier shall be ≥ 95 % of the maximum throughput
of the reference measurement channels as specified in Annexes A.2.2,
A.3.2, and A.3.3 (with one sided dynamic OCNG Pattern OP.1 FDD/TDD for
the DL-signal as described in Annex A.5.1.1/A.5.2.1).

#### 7.8A.2.3 Wide band intermodulation for Inter-band CA

For inter-band carrier aggregation with one component carrier per
operating band and the uplink assigned to one NR band, the wide band
intermodulation requirements are defined with the uplink active on the
band(s) other than the band whose downlink is being tested. The UE shall
meet the requirements specified in clause 7.8 for each component carrier
while all downlink carriers are active.

For the UE which supports inter-band CA configuration in Table
7.3A.3.2.1-1, P~interferer~ power defined in Table 7.8.2-1 and 7.8.2-2
is increased by the amount given by ΔR~IB,c~ in Table 7.3A.3.2.1-1.

The throughput of each carrier shall be ≥ 95 % of the maximum throughput
of the reference measurement channels as specified in Annexes A.2.2,
A.3.2, and A.3.3 (with one sided dynamic OCNG Pattern OP.1 FDD/TDD for
the DL-signal as described in Annex A.5.1.1/A.5.2.1).

7.8B Intermodulation characteristics for NR-DC
----------------------------------------------

For inter-band NR-DC configurations, the intermodulation characteristics
for the corresponding inter-band CA configuration as specified in clause
7.8A applies.

7.8D Intermodulation characteristics for UL MIMO
------------------------------------------------

For UE(s) with two transmitter antenna connectors in closed-loop spatial
multiplexing scheme, the minimum requirements in clause 7.8 shall be met
with the UL MIMO configurations described in clause 6.2D.1. For UL MIMO,
the parameter P~CMAX\_L~ is defined as the total transmitter power over
the two transmit antenna connectors.

7.8E Intermodulation characteristics for V2X
--------------------------------------------

### 7.8E.1 General

Intermodulation response rejection is a measure of the capability of the
receiver to receive a wanted signal on its assigned channel frequency in
the presence of two or more interfering signals which have a specific
frequency relationship to the wanted signal.

### 7.8E.2 Wide band Intermodulation

#### 7.8E.2.1 General

The wide band intermodulation requirement is defined using modulated NR
carrier and a CW signal as interferer 1 and interferer 2 respectively.
The throughput shall be ≥ 95 % of the maximum throughput of the
reference measurement channels as specified in Annexes A.7.2 with
parameters specified in Table 7.8E.2-1 for NR V2X bands. The relative
throughput requirement shall be met for any SCS specified for the
channel bandwidth of the wanted signal.

#### 7.8E.2.2 Wide band Intermodulation for V2X con-current operation

For the inter-band con-current NR V2X operation, the requirements
specified in clause 7.8E.2.1 shall apply for the NR sidelink reception
in the operating bands in Table 5.2E.2-1 and the requirements specified
in clause 7.8 shall apply for the NR downlink reception in licensed band
while all downlink carriers are active.

7.8F Intermodulation characteristics for shared spectrum channel access
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

### 7.8F.1 General

Intermodulation response rejection is a measure of the capability of the
receiver to receive a wanted signal on its assigned channel frequency in
the presence of two or more interfering signals which have a specific
frequency relationship to the wanted signal

### 7.8F.2 Wide band Intermodulation

The wide band intermodulation requirement is defined using a CW carrier
and modulated NR signal as interferer 1 and interferer 2 respectively.

Instead of the general wideband intermodulation requirements specified
in clause 7.8.2, the throughput shall be ≥ 95 % of the maximum
throughput of the reference measurement channels as specified in Annexes
A.2.2, A.3.2 and A.3.3 (with one sided dynamic OCNG Pattern OP.1 FDD/TDD
for the DL-signal as described in Annex A.5.1.1/A.5.2.1) with parameters
specified in Table 7.8F.2-1. The relative throughput requirement shall
be met for any SCS specified for the channel bandwidth of the wanted
signal.
