Foreword
========

This Technical Specification has been produced by the 3rd Generation
Partnership Project (3GPP).

The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work
within the TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the
TSG modify the contents of the present document, it will be re-released
by the TSG with an identifying change of release date and an increase in
version number as follows:

Version x.y.z

where:

x the first digit:

1 presented to TSG for information;

2 presented to TSG for approval;

3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.

y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e.
technical enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.

z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been
incorporated in the document.

In the present document, modal verbs have the following meanings:

**shall** indicates a mandatory requirement to do something

**shall not** indicates an interdiction (prohibition) to do something

The constructions \"shall\" and \"shall not\" are confined to the
context of normative provisions, and do not appear in Technical Reports.

The constructions \"must\" and \"must not\" are not used as substitutes
for \"shall\" and \"shall not\". Their use is avoided insofar as
possible, and they are not used in a normative context except in a
direct citation from an external, referenced, non-3GPP document, or so
as to maintain continuity of style when extending or modifying the
provisions of such a referenced document.

**should** indicates a recommendation to do something

**should not** indicates a recommendation not to do something

**may** indicates permission to do something

**need not** indicates permission not to do something

The construction \"may not\" is ambiguous and is not used in normative
elements. The unambiguous constructions \"might not\" or \"shall not\"
are used instead, depending upon the meaning intended.

**can** indicates that something is possible

**cannot** indicates that something is impossible

The constructions \"can\" and \"cannot\" are not substitutes for \"may\"
and \"need not\".

**will** indicates that something is certain or expected to happen as a
result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside
the scope of the present document

**will not** indicates that something is certain or expected not to
happen as a result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which
is outside the scope of the present document

**might** indicates a likelihood that something will happen as a result
of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document

**might not** indicates a likelihood that something will not happen as a
result of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside
the scope of the present document

In addition:

**is** (or any other verb in the indicative mood) indicates a statement
of fact

**is not** (or any other negative verb in the indicative mood) indicates
a statement of fact

The constructions \"is\" and \"is not\" do not indicate requirements.

 1 Scope
=======

The present specifies document the Radio Frequency (RF) test methods and
conformance requirements for NR Integrated access and backhaul: *IAB
type 1-H*, *IAB type 1-O* and *IAB type 2-O*. These have been derived
from, and are consistent with the radiated requirements for *IAB type
1-H*, *IAB type 1-O* and *IAB type 2-O* in BS specification defined in
TS 38.174 \[2\].

A *IAB type 1-H* has both conducted and radiated requirements, so it
requires compliance to the applicable requirements of the present
document and TS 38.176-1 \[3\].

*IAB type 1-O* and *IAB type 2-O* have only radiated requirements, so
they require compliance to the present document only.

4 General radiated test conditions and declarations
===================================================

4.1 Measurement uncertainties and test requirements
---------------------------------------------------

### 4.1.1 General

The requirements of this clause apply to all applicable tests in
TS 38.176-2 (the present document), i.e. to all radiated tests defined
in FR1 for *IAB type 1-H*, *IAB type 1-O* and radiated tests defined in
FR2 for *IAB type 2-O*. The frequency ranges FR1 and FR2 are defined in
clause 5.1 of TS 38.174 \[2\].

The minimum requirements are given in TS 38.174 \[2\]. Test Tolerances
for the radiated test requirements (TT~OTA~) explicitly stated in the
present document are given in annex C.

Test Tolerances are individually calculated for each test. Test
Tolerances are used to relax the minimum requirements to create test
requirements.

When a test requirement differs from the corresponding minimum
requirement, then the Test Tolerance applied for the test is non-zero.
The Test Tolerance for the test and the explanation of how the minimum
requirement has been relaxed by the Test Tolerance are given in annex C.

The requirements are classified according to spatial characteristics as
shown in table 4.1.1-1 and table 4.1.1-2.

### 4.1.2 Acceptable uncertainty of OTA Test System

#### 4.1.2.1 General

The maximum acceptable uncertainty of the OTA Test System is specified
below for each radiated test defined explicitly in the present
specification, where appropriate.

The OTA Test System shall enable the stimulus signals in the test case
to be adjusted to within the specified tolerance and the EUT to be
measured with an uncertainty not exceeding the specified values. All
tolerances and uncertainties are absolute values, and are valid for a
confidence level of 95 %, unless otherwise stated.

A confidence level of 95% is the measurement uncertainty tolerance
interval for a specific measurement that contains 95% of the performance
of a population of test equipment.

For details on measurement uncertainty budget calculation, OTA
measurement methodology description (including calibration and
measurement stage for each test range), MU budget format and its
contributions, refer to TR 37.941 \[25\].

#### 4.1.2.2 Measurement of transmitter

The maximum OTA Test System uncertainty for OTA transmitter tests
minimum requirements are given in tables 4.1.2.2-1 and 4.1.2.2-2.
Details for derivation of OTA Test System uncertainty are given in
corresponding clauses in TR 37.941 \[25\].

### 4.1.3 Interpretation of measurement results

The measurement results returned by the OTA Test System are compared -
without any modification - against the test requirements as defined by
the Shared Risk principle in Recommendation ITU-R M.1545 \[12\].

The actual measurement uncertainty of the OTA Test System for the
measurement of each parameter shall be included in the test report.

The recorded value for the OTA Test System uncertainty shall be, for
each OTA measurement, equal to or lower than the appropriate figure in
clause 4.1.2 of the present document.

If the OTA Test System for an OTA test is known to have a measurement
uncertainty greater than that specified in clause 4.1.2, it is still
permitted to use this apparatus provided that an adjustment is made as
follows:

Any additional uncertainty in the OTA Test System over and above that
specified in clause 4.1.2 shall be used to tighten the OTA test
requirement, making the test harder to pass. For some tests e.g.
receiver tests, this may require modification of stimulus signals. This
procedure will ensure that an OTA Test System not compliant with
clause 4.1.2 does not increase the chance of passing a EUT where that
device would otherwise have failed the test if an OTA Test System
compliant with clause 4.1.2 had been used.

4.2 Radiated requirement reference points
-----------------------------------------

Radiated characteristics for *IAB type 1-H*, *IAB type 1-O* and *IAB
type 2-O* are defined over the air (OTA) where the operating band
specific radiated interface is referred to as the *Radiated Interface
Boundary* (RIB). Radiated requirements are also referred to as OTA
requirements. The (spatial) characteristics in which the OTA
requirements apply are detailed for each requirement. For *IAB type 1-H*
the requirements are defined for two points of reference, signified by
radiated requirements at the RIB and the conducted requirements at
*transceiver array boundary* (TAB). The OTA requirements of *IAB type
1-H* are tested in the far field (Fraunhofer) region.

General architecture and reference points of *IAB type 1-H*, *IAB type
1-O* and *IAB type 2-O* are presented on the following figures 4.2-1 and
4.2-2.

height="2.7291666666666665in"}

Figure 4.2-1: General architecture of *IAB type 1-H*

The present document details only radiated test requirements and hence
only requires the radiated reference points.

height="2.673611111111111in"}

Figure 4.2-2: General architecture of *IAB type 1-O* and *IAB type 2-O*

The transceiver unit array is part of the composite transceiver
functionality generating modulated transmit signal structures and
performing receiver combining and demodulation.

The transceiver unit array contains an implementation specific number of
transmitter units and an implementation specific number of receiver
units. Transmitter units and receiver units may be combined into
transceiver units. The transmitter/receiver units have the ability to
receive/send parallel independent modulated symbol streams.

The composite antenna contains a *radio distribution network* (RDN) and
an antenna array. The RDN is a linear passive network that distributes
the RF power between the *transceiver array boundary* and the antenna
array, in an implementation specific way.

4.3 IAB classes
---------------

### 4.3.1 *IAB-DU class*

The requirements in the present document apply to Wide Area IAB-DU,
Medium Range IAB-DU and Local Area IAB-DU unless otherwise stated. The
associated deployment scenarios for each class are exactly the same for
IAB-DU with and without connectors.

For *IAB* *type 1-O* and 2-O, IAB-DU classes are defined as indicated
below:

\- Wide Area IAB-DU are characterised by requirements derived from Macro
Cell scenarios with a BS to UE minimum distance along the ground equal
to 35 m.

\- Medium Range IAB-DU are characterised by requirements derived from
Micro Cell scenarios with a BS to UE minimum distance along the ground
equal to 5 m.

\- Local Area IAB-DU are characterised by requirements derived from Pico
Cell scenarios with a BS to UE minimum distance along the ground equal
to 2 m.

The manufacturer shall declare the intended class of the IAB under test.

### 4.3.2 *IAB-MT class*

*The requirements in the present document apply to Wide Area IAB-MT and
Local Area IAB-MT classes unless otherwise stated.*

*For IAB type 1-O, and IAB type 2-O, IAB-MT classes are defined as
indicated below:*

\- Wide Area IAB-MT are characterised by requirements derived from Macro
Cell and/or Micro Cell scenarios.

\- Local Area IAB-MT are characterised by requirements derived from Pico
Cell and /or Micro Cell scenarios.

4.4 Regional requirements
-------------------------

Some requirements in the present document may only apply in certain
regions either as optional requirements, or set by local and regional
regulation as mandatory requirements. It is normally not stated in the
3GPP specifications under what exact circumstances that the requirements
apply, since this is defined by local or regional regulation.

Table 4.4-1 lists all requirements in the present specification that may
be applied differently in different regions.

#### 4.7.2.2 IABTC1: Contiguous spectrum operation

The purpose of test configuration IABTC1 is to test all IAB-DU and
IAB-MT requirements excluding CA occupied bandwidth.

For IABTC1 used in receiver tests only the two outermost UL carriers and
two outermost DL carriers within each supported operating band need to
be generated by the test equipment.

##### 4.7.2.2.1 IABTC1 generation

IABTC1 shall be constructed on a per band basis using the following
method:

\- The *IAB RF Bandwidth* of each supported operating band shall be the
declared maximum radiated *IAB RF Bandwidth* for contiguous operation
(D.17).

\- Select the IAB-DU and IAB-MT carrier to be tested according to
4.7.2.1 and place them adjacent to the lower *IAB-DU and IAB-MT RF
Bandwidth edge*. Place same signals adjacent to the upper IAB-DU and
IAB-MT RF Bandwidth edge.

\- For transmitter tests, select as many IAB-DU and IAB-MT carriers
(according to 4.7.2.1) that the beam supports within a band and that fit
in the rest of the declared maximum *IAB RF Bandwidth*. Place the
carriers adjacent to each other starting from the upper *IAB RF
Bandwidth edge*. The nominal carrier spacing defined in TS 38.174 \[2\]
clause 5.4.1 shall apply;

The test configuration should be constructed on a per band basis for all
component carriers of the inter-band CA bands declared to be supported
by the beam (D.60). All configured component carriers are transmitted
simultaneously in the tests where the transmitter should be on.

##### 4.7.2.2.2 IABTC1 power allocation

Set the number of carriers to the number of carriers at maximum TRP
(D.15).

For EIRP accuracy requirements set each beam to rated beam EIRP (D.11)
for the tested *beam direction pair*.

For all other requirements set the power of each carrier to the same
level so that the sum of the carrier powers equals the rated transmitter
TRP P~rated,t,TRP~ (D.38).

*For a beam declared to support CA-only operation (D.20), s*et the power
spectral density of each carrier to the same level so that the sum of
the carrier power equals the same value as above.

#### 4.7.2.3 IABTC2: Contiguous CA occupied bandwidth

IABTC2 in this clause is used to test CA occupied bandwidth.

##### 4.7.2.3.1 IABTC2 generation

IABTC2 shall be constructed on a per band basis using the following
method:

\- All component carrier combinations supported by the beam, which have
different sum of channel bandwidths of **component carrier**, shall be
tested. For all **component carrier** combinations which have the same
sum of channel bandwidths of **component carriers**, only one of the
component carrier combinations shall be tested.

\- Of all **component carrier** combinations which have same sum of
channel bandwidths of **component carrier**, select those with the
narrowest carrier with the smallest supported subcarrier spacing
declared per *operating band* (D.7) at the lower *IAB RF Bandwidth
edge*.

\- Of the combinations selected in the previous step, select one with
the narrowest carrier with the smallest supported subcarrier spacing
declared per *operating band* (D.7) at the upper *IAB RF Bandwidth
edge*.

\- If there are multiple combinations fulfilling previous steps, select
the one with the smallest number of **component carrier**.

\- If there are multiple combinations fulfilling previous steps, select
the one with the widest carrier with the smallest supported subcarrier
spacing declared per *operating band* (D.7) being adjacent to the lowest
carrier.

\- If there are multiple combinations fulfilling previous steps, select
the one with the widest carrier with the smallest supported subcarrier
spacing declared per *operating band* (D.7) being adjacent to the
highest carrier.

\- If there are multiple combinations fulfilling previous steps, select
the one with the widest carrier with the smallest supported subcarrier
spacing declared per *operating band* (D.7) being adjacent to the
carrier which has been selected in the previous step.

\- If there are multiple combinations fulfilling previous steps, repeat
the previous step until there is only one combination left.

\- The nominal channel spacing defined in TS 38.174 \[2\] clause 5.4.1
shall apply.

##### 4.7.2.3.2 IABTC2 power allocation

Set the number of carriers to the number of carriers at maximum TRP
(D.15).

For EIRP accuracy requirements set each beam to rated beam EIRP (D.11)
for the tested *beam direction pair*.

*S*et the power spectral density of each carrier to the same level so
that the sum of the carrier powers equals the rated transmitter TRP
P~rated,t,TRP~ (D.38).

#### 4.7.2.4 IABTC3: Non-contiguous spectrum operation

The purpose of IABTC3 is to test NR multicarrier non-contiguous aspects.

For IABTC3 used in receiver tests, outermost DL and UL carriers for each
sub-block need to be generated by the test equipment; other supported
carriers are optional to be generated.

##### 4.7.2.4.1 IABTC3 generation

IABTC3 is constructed on a per band basis using the following method:

\- The *IAB RF Bandwidth* of each supported operating band shall be the
declared maximum radiated *IAB RF Bandwidth* for non-contiguous
operation (D.17). The *IAB RF Bandwidth* consists of one sub-block gap
and two sub-blocks located at the edges of the declared maximum radiated
*IAB RF Bandwidth* for non-contiguous operation (D.17).

\- Select the IAB-DU carrier and IAB-MT carrier to be tested according
to 4.7.2.1. Place them adjacent to the upper *IAB RF Bandwidth edge* and
place the same signals adjacent to the lower *IAB RF Bandwidth edge*.

\- For single-band operation receiver tests, if the remaining gap is at
least 15 MHz (or 60 MHz if channel bandwidth of the carrier to be tested
is 20 MHz) for FR1 or 150 MHz for FR2 plus two times the *channel
bandwidth* used in the previous step and the beam supports at least 4
carriers, place a IAB-DU carrier and IAB-MT carrier of this *channel
bandwidth* adjacent to each already placed carrier for each sub-block.
The nominal channel spacing defined in TS 38.174 \[2\] clause 5.4.1
shall apply.

\- The sub-block edges adjacent to the sub-block gap shall be determined
using the specified F~offset\_high~ and F~offset\_low~ for the carriers
adjacent to the sub-block gap.

##### 4.7.2.4.2 IABTC3 power allocation

Set the number of carriers to the number of carriers at maximum TRP
(D.15).

For EIRP accuracy requirements set each beam to rated beam EIRP (D.11)
for the tested *beam direction pair*.

For all other requirements set the power of each carrier to the same
level so that the sum of the carrier powers equals the rated transmitter
TRP P~rated,\ t,TRP~ (D.38).

#### 4.7.2.5 IABTC4: Multi-band test configuration for full carrier allocation

The purpose of IABTC4 is to test beams which have been generated using
transceiver units supporting operation in multiple operating bands
through common active RF components, considering maximum supported
number of carriers.

##### 4.7.2.5.1 IABTC4 generation

IABTC4 is based on re-using the existing test configuration applicable
per band on beams generated using Multi-band transceiver units and hence
have declared multi-band dependencies (D.16). It is constructed using
the following method:

\- The *IAB RF Bandwidth* of each supported operating band shall be the
declared maximum radiated *IAB RF Bandwidth* (D.17).

\- The number of carriers of each supported operating band shall be the
declared maximum number of supported carriers per *operating band* in
multi-band operation (D.21). Carriers shall be selected according to
4.7.2.1 and shall first be placed at the outermost edges of the declared
maximum radiated *Radio Bandwidth* (D.18). Additional carriers shall
next be placed at the edges of *IAB RF Bandwidth*, if possible.

\- The allocated *IAB RF Bandwidth* of the outermost bands shall be
located at the outermost edges of the declared maximum radiated *Radio
Bandwidth* (D.18).

\- Each concerned band shall be considered as an independent band and
the corresponding test configuration shall be generated in each band.
The mirror image of the single band test configuration shall be used in
the highest band being tested for the beam.

\-- If an operating band with multi-band dependencies supports three
carriers only, two carriers shall be placed in one band according to the
relevant test configuration while the remaining carrier shall be placed
at the edge of the maximum *Radio Bandwidth* in the other band.

\- If the sum of the maximum *IAB RF bandwidths* of each of the
supported operating bands is greater than the declared *total RF
bandwidth* BW~tot~ (D.19) of transmitter and receiver for the declared
band combinations of the IAB, then repeat the steps above for test
configurations where the *IAB RF Bandwidth* of one of the operating band
shall be reduced so that the declared *total RF bandwidth* is not
exceeded and vice versa.

\- If the sum of the maximum number of supported carriers per *operating
band* in multi-band operation (D.21) is larger than the declared total
maximum number of supported carriers in multi-band operation (D.63),
repeat the steps above for test configurations where in each test
configuration the number of carriers of one of the operating band shall
be reduced so that the total number of supported carriers is not be
exceeded and vice versa.

##### 4.7.2.5.2 IABTC4 power allocation

Set the number of carriers to the total maximum number of supported
carriers in multi-band operation (D.63).

For EIRP accuracy requirements set each beam to rated beam EIRP (D.11)
for the tested *beam direction pair*.

For all other requirements set the power of each carrier to the same
level so that the sum of the carrier powers equals the rated transmitter
TRP P~rated,\ t,TRP~ (D.38).

If the allocated number of carriers in an operating band exceeds the
declared number of carriers at maximum TRP in an operating band (D.15)
the carriers should if possible be allocated to a different operating
band.

#### 4.7.2.6 IABTC5: Multi-band test configuration with high PSD per carrier

The purpose of IABTC5 is to test multi-band operation aspects
considering higher PSD cases with reduced number of carriers and
non-contiguous operation (if supported) in multi-band mode.

##### 4.7.2.6.1 IABTC5 generation

IABTC5 is based on re-using the existing test configuration applicable
for operating bands using multi-band transceiver units and hence have
declared multi-band dependencies (D.16)*.* It is constructed using the
following method:

\- The *IAB RF Bandwidth* of each supported operating band shall be the
declared maximum radiated *IAB RF Bandwidth* (D.17).

\- The allocated *Radio Bandwidth* of the outermost bands shall be
located at the outermost edges of the declared maximum *Radio Bandwidth*
of the operating band with multi-band dependencies (D.18).

\- The maximum number of carriers is limited to two per band. Carriers
shall be selected according to 4.7.2.1 and shall be placed at the
outermost edges of the declared maximum *Radio Bandwidth* of the
operating band with multi-band dependencies (D.18).

\- Each concerned band shall be considered as an independent band and
the carrier placement in each band shall be according to IABTC3, where
the declared parameters for multi-band operation shall apply. Narrowest
supported *IAB channel bandwidth* with the smallest subcarrier spacing
declared per *operating band* (D.7) shall be used in the test
configuration.

\- If an *operating band* with multi-band dependencies supports three
carriers only, two carriers shall be placed in one band according to the
relevant test configuration while the remaining carrier shall be placed
at the edge of the maximum *Radio Bandwidth* in the other band.

\- If the sum of the maximum *IAB RF bandwidths* of each of the
supported *operating bands* is greater than the declared *total RF
bandwidth* BW~tot~ (D.19) of transmitter and receiver for the declared
band combinations of the IAB, then repeat the steps above for test
configurations where the *IAB RF Bandwidth* of one of the *operating
band* shall be reduced so that the declared *total RF bandwidth* BW~tot~
of the *operating band* with multi-band dependencies (D.18) is not
exceeded and vice versa.

##### 4.7.2.6.2 IABTC5 power allocation

Set the number of carriers to the total maximum number of supported
carriers in multi-band operation (D.63).

For EIRP accuracy requirements set each beam to rated beam EIRP (D.11)
for the tested *beam direction pair*.

For all other requirements set the power of each carrier to the same
level so that the sum of the carrier powers equals the rated transmitter
TRP P~rated,\ t,TRP~ (D.38).

If the sum of the TRP for all carriers in an operating band(s) exceeds
the sum of the rated carrier TRP output power P~rated,c,TRP~ (D.37) for
the number of carriers at maximum TRP (D.15) in multi-band operation,
the exceeded part shall, if possible, be reallocated into the other
band(s). If the TRP allocated for a carrier exceeds the declared rated
carrier OTA IAB power, P~rated,c,TRP~, the exceeded power shall, if
possible, be reallocated into the other carriers.

4.9 RF channels and test models
-------------------------------

### 4.9.1 RF channels

For the single carrier testing many tests in the present document are
performed with appropriate frequencies in the bottom, middle and top
channels of the supported frequency range of the IAB. These are denoted
as RF channels B (bottom), M (middle) and T (top).

Unless otherwise stated, the test shall be performed with a single
carrier at each of the RF channels B, M and T.

Many tests in the present document are performed with the maximum *IAB
RF Bandwidth* located at the bottom, middle and top of the supported
frequency range in the operating band. These are denoted as B~RFBW~
(bottom), M~RFBW~ (middle) and T~RFBW~ (top).

Unless otherwise stated, the test shall be performed at B~RFBW~, M~RFBW~
and T~RFBW~ defined as following:

\- B~RFBW~: maximum *IAB RF Bandwidth* located at the bottom of the
supported frequency range in the operating band.

\- M~RFBW~: maximum *IAB RF Bandwidth* located in the middle of the
supported frequency range in the operating band.

\- T~RFBW~: maximum *IAB RF Bandwidth* located at the top of the
supported frequency range in the operating band.

For a IAB capable of multi-band operation and capable of dual-band
operation, unless otherwise stated, the test shall be performed at
B~RFBW~\_T\'~RFBW~ and B\'~RFBW~\_T~RFBW~ defined as following:

\- B~RFBW~\_ T\'~RFBW~: the *IAB RF Bandwidths* located at the bottom of
the supported frequency range in the lower operating band and at the
highest possible simultaneous frequency position, within the maximum
*Radio Bandwidth*, in the upper operating band.

\- B\'~RFBW~\_T~RFBW~: the *IAB RF Bandwidths* located at the top of the
supported frequency range in the upper operating band and at the lowest
possible simultaneous frequency position, within the maximum *Radio
Bandwidth*, in the lower operating band.

NOTE: B~RFBW~\_T\'~RFBW~ = B\'~RFBW~\_T~RFBW~ = B~RFBW~\_T~RFBW~ when
the declared maximum *Radio Bandwidth* (see clause 4.6) spans both
operating bands. B~RFBW~\_T~RFBW~ means the *IAB RF Bandwidths* are
located at the bottom of the supported frequency range in the lower
operating band and at the top of the supported frequency range in the
upper operating band.

Occupied bandwidth test in the present document are performed with the
*aggregated IAB channel bandwidth* and sub-block bandwidths located at
the bottom, middle and top of the supported frequency range in the
operating band. These are denoted as B~BW\ Channel\ CA~(bottom),
M~BW\ Channel\ CA~ (middle) and T~BW\ Channel\ CA~ (top) for contiguous
spectrum operation.

Unless otherwise stated, the test for contiguous spectrum operation
shall be performed at B~BW\ Channel\ CA~, M~BW\ Channel\ CA~ and
T~BW\ Channel\ CA~ defined as following:

\- B~BW\ Channel\ CA~: *aggregated IAB channel bandwidth* located at the
bottom of the supported frequency range in each operating band;

\- M~BW\ Channel\ CA~: *aggregated IAB channel bandwidth* located close
in the middle of the supported frequency range in each operating band;

\- T~BW\ Channel\ CA~: *aggregated IAB channel bandwidth* located at the
top of the supported frequency range in each operating band.

When a test is performed by a test laboratory, the position of B, M and
T for single carrier, B~RFBW~, M~RFBW~ and T~RFBW~ for single band
operation, B~BW\ Channel\ CA~, M~BW\ Channel\ CA~ and T~BW\ Channel\ CA~
for contiguous spectrum operation in the operating band, the position of
B~RFBW~\_T\'~RFBW~ and B\'~RFBW~\_T~RFBW~ in the supported operating
band combinations shall be specified by the laboratory. The laboratory
may consult with operators, the manufacturer or other bodies.

4.10 Requirements for contiguous and non-contiguous spectrum
------------------------------------------------------------

A spectrum allocation where an IAB operates can either be contiguous or
non-contiguous. Unless otherwise stated, the requirements in the present
specification apply for IAB configured for both *contiguous spectrum*
operation and *non-contiguous spectrum* operation.

For IAB operation in *non-contiguous spectrum*, some requirements apply
both at the *IAB-DU RF Bandwidth edges* or *IAB-MT RF bandwidth edges*
and inside the *sub-block gaps*. For each such requirement, it is stated
how the limits apply relative to the *IAB-DU RF Bandwidth edges* or
*IAB-MT RF bandwidth edges* and the *sub-block* edges respectively.

### 4.11 Requirements for IAB capable of multi-band operation

For *multi-band* *RIB*, the RF requirements in clause 6 and 7 apply
separately to each supported *operating band* unless otherwise stated.
For some requirements, it is explicitly stated that specific additions
or exclusions to the requirement apply at *multi-band RIB(s)* as
detailed in the requirement clause.

*IAB type 1-O* may be capable of supporting operation in multiple
*operating bands* with one of the following implementations at the
*radiated interface boundary*:

\- All RIBs are *single-band RIBs*.

\- All RIBs are *multi-band* *RIBs*.

\- A combination of single-band *RIBs* and *multi-band RIBs* provides
support of the *IAB type 1-O* capability of operation in multiple
*operating bands*.

For *multi-band RIBs* supporting the bands for TDD, the RF requirements
in the present specification assume no simultaneous uplink and downlink
occur between the bands.

4.12 Co-location requirements
-----------------------------

### 4.12.1 General

Co-location requirements are requirements which are based on assuming
the *IAB type 1-O* is co-located with another BS or IAB of the same base
station class. They ensure that both co-located systems can operate with
minimal degradation to each other.

The co-location requirements in table 4.12.1-1 rely on a *co-location
reference antenna* used to mimic an IAB to base station or IAB
co-location scenario.

The OTA transmit ON/OFF power requirement and OTA transmitter
intermodulation requirement are mandatory requirements where the test
requirement is derived using the *co-location reference antenna*, which
represents the worst-case scenario.

The *co-location reference antenna* is defined in TS 38.174 \[2\].

### 4.12.2 Co-location test antenna

#### 4.12.2.1 General

Co-location requirements are specified as power levels into or out of
the conducted interface of the *co-location reference antenna*. For
conformance testing the requirements are translated to the input or
output of a *co-location test antenna* (CLTA).

A CLTA is a practical antenna which can be used to test conformance to
the co-location requirements.

#### 4.12.2.2 Co-location test antenna characteristics

A *co-location test antenna* is a practical passive antenna that is used
for conformance testing of the co-location requirements and is based on
the definition of the *co-location reference antenna*. A CLTA shall
comply with the requirements specified in table 4.12.2.2-1.

Translation of the requirements to other test antennas are not precluded
but suitable translations between the co-location reference antenna and
test antenna must be provided to demonstrate that the method is within
the specified MU.

NOTE: The currently defined CLTAs are suitable for testing *IAB type
1-O* implemented with a planar antenna array. The method for testing IAB
with other antenna array implementations is not covered by the present
release of the present document.

#### 4.12.2.3 Co-location test antenna alignment

The alignment between the NR IAB under test and the *co-location test

same physical alignment applies to in-band and out-of-band co-location

4.13 Test efficiency optimization
---------------------------------

When manufacture declares the same RF implementation for IAB-MT and
IAB-DU (D.IAB-1) and the declarations in table 4.13-1 are the same for
IAB-DU and IAB-MT, it is sufficient to test only IAB-MT or IAB-DU with
the test requirement applicability according to table 4.13-2 for Tx
requirements and table 4.13-3 for Rx requirements.

For *IAB type 1-H* the test efficiency optimization for radiated
requirements apply only for radiated transmit power and OTA sensitivity.
Test efficiency optimization for conducted requirements is defined in TS
38.176-1 \[3\].

For *IAB type 1-O* and *IAB type 2-O* it is required that the DUT
selection between requirements follows following rules:

\- out of radiated transmit power, OTA modulation quality and OTA
frequency error, IAB-DU and IAB-MT are required to be the DUT at least
once,

\- out of OTA ACLR, OTA operating band unwanted emissions and OTA
transmitter general spurious emissions, are required to be the DUT at
least once,

\- out of OTA reference sensitivity, OTA ACS, OTA receiver
intermodulation, IAB-DU and IAB-MT are required to be the DUT at least
once.

In some cases, the test requirements are the same but the MU for the
IAB-MT is larger than for the IAB-DU. When the test efficiency
optimization is applicable for such cases, the lower MU value should be
used.

IAB-MT for test efficiency optimization to apply**

4.14 Format and interpretation of tests
---------------------------------------

Each test has a standard format:

**X Title**

All tests are applicable to all equipment within the scope of the
present document, unless otherwise stated.

**X.1 Definition and applicability**

This clause gives the general definition of the parameter under
consideration and specifies whether the test is applicable to all
equipment or only to a certain subset. Required manufacturer
declarations may be included here.

**X.2 Minimum requirement**

This clause contains the reference to the clause to the 3GPP reference
(or core) specification which defines the minimum requirement.

**X.3 Test purpose**

This clause defines the purpose of the test.

**X.4 Method of test**

**X.4.1 General**

In some cases there are alternative test procedures or initial
conditions. In such cases, guidance for which initial conditions and
test procedures can be applied are stated here. In the case only one
test procedure is applicable, that is stated here.

**X.4.2y First test method**

**X.4.2y.1 Initial conditions**

This clause defines the initial conditions for each test, including the
test environment, the RF channels to be tested and the basic measurement
set-up.

**X.4.2y.2 Procedure**

This clause describes the steps necessary to perform the test and
provides further details of the test definition like domain (e.g.
frequency-span), range, weighting (e.g. bandwidth), and algorithms
(e.g. averaging). The procedure may comprise data processing of the
measurement result before comparison with the test requirement (e.g.
average result from several measurement positions).

**X.4.3y Alternative test method (if any)**

If there are alternative test methods, each is described with its
initial conditions and procedures.

**X.5 Test requirement**

This clause defines the pass/fail criteria for the equipment under test,
see clause 4.1.3 (Interpretation of measurement results). Test
requirements for every minimum requirement referred in clause X.2 are
listed here. Cases where minimum requirements do not apply need not be
mentioned.

4.15 Reference coordinate system
--------------------------------

Radiated requirements are stated in terms of electromagnetic
characteristics (e.g. EIRP and EIS) at certain angles with respect to
the base station. To be able to declare radiated characteristics part of
radiated requirements a reference coordinate system is required. The
reference coordinate system is should be associated to an identifiable
physical feature on the base station enclosure. The location of the
origin and the orientation of the reference coordinate system are for
the base station manufacturer to declare.

The reference coordinate system is created of a Cartesian coordinate
system with rectangular axis (x***,*** y***,*** z) and spherical angles
(θ, φ) as showed in figure 4.15-1.

![](media/image12.emf){width="3.9375in" height="4.069444444444445in"}

Figure 4.15-1: Reference coordinate system

φ is the angle in the x/y plane, between the x-axis and the projection
of the radiating vector onto the x/y plane and is defined between -180°
and +180°, inclusive. θ is the angle between the projection of the
vector in the x***/***y plane and the radiating vector and is defined
between -90° and +90°, inclusive. Note that θ is defined as positive
along the down-tilt angle.

5 Operating bands and channel arrangement
=========================================

For the IAB operation in NR operating bands specification, their channel
bandwidth configurations, channel spacing and raster, as well as
synchronization raster specification, refer to TS 38.174 \[2\], clause 5
and its relevant clauses.

For radiated testing purposes in the present document, FR1 and FR2
operating bands are considered.

6 Radiated transmitter characteristics
======================================

6.1 General
-----------

General test conditions for transmitter tests are given in clause 4,
including interpretation of measurement results and configurations for
testing. IAB configurations for the tests are defined in clause 4.5.

If beams have been declared equivalent and parallel (D.13, D.14), only a
representative beam is necessary to be tested to demonstrate
conformance.

6.2 Radiated transmit power
---------------------------

### 6.2.1 Definition and applicability

*IAB-DU and IAB-MT type 1-H, IAB-DU and IAB-MT type 1-O* and *IAB-DU and
IAB-MT type 2-O* are declared to support one or more beams, as per
manufacturer\'s declarations. Radiated transmit power is defined as the
EIRP level for a declared beam at a specific *beam peak direction*.
Declarations are done for IAB-DU and IAB-MT separately.

For each beam, the requirement is based on declaration of a beam
identity, *reference beam direction pair*, beamwidth, *rated beam EIRP*,
*OTA peak directions set*, the *beam direction pairs* at the maximum
steering directions and their associated *rated beam EIRP* and
beamwidth(s).

For a declared beam and *beam direction pair*, the *rated beam EIRP*
level is the maximum power that the IAB-DU or IAB-MT is declared to
radiate at the associated *beam peak direction* during the *transmitter
ON period*.

For each *beam peak direction* associated with a *beam direction pair*
within the *OTA peak directions set*, a specific *rated beam EIRP* level
may be claimed. Any claimed value shall be met within the accuracy
requirement as described below. *Rated beam EIRP* is only required to be
declared for the *beam direction pairs* subject to conformance testing.

NOTE 1: *OTA peak directions set* is set of *beam peak directions* for
which the EIRP accuracy requirement is intended to be met. The *beam
peak directions* are related to a corresponding contiguous range or
discrete list of *beam centre directions* by the *beam direction pairs*
included in the set.

NOTE 2: A *beam direction pair* is data set consisting of the *beam
centre direction* and the related *beam peak direction.*

NOTE 3: A declared EIRP value is a value provided by the manufacturer
for verification according to the conformance specification declaration
requirements, whereas a claimed EIRP value is provided by the
manufacturer to the equipment user for normal operation of the equipment
and is not subject to formal conformance testing.

> For *operating bands* where the supported *fractional bandwidth* (FBW)
> is larger than 6%, two rated carrier EIRP may be declared by
> manufacturer:

\- P~rated,c,FBWlow~ for lower supported frequency range, and

\- P~rated,c,FBWhigh~ for higher supported frequency range.

For frequencies in between F~FBWlow~ and F~FBWhigh~ the rated carrier
EIRP is:

\- P~rated,c,FBWlow,~ for the carrier whose carrier frequency is within
frequency range F~FBWlow~ ≤ f \< (F~FBWlow~ +F~FBWhigh~) / 2,

\- P~rated,c,FBWhigh,~ for the carrier whose carrier frequency is within
frequency range (F~FBWlow~ +F~FBWhigh~) / 2 ≤ f ≤F~FBWhigh~.

### 6.2.2 Minimum requirement

Radiated transmit power minimum requirement for *IAB-DU type 1-H, IAB-DU
type 1-O, IAB-MT type 1-H and IAB-MT type 1-O* is defined in
TS 38.174 \[2\], clause 9.2.2.

Radiated transmit power minimum requirement for *IAB-DU type 2-O and
IAB-MT type 2-O* is defined in TS 38.174 \[2\], clause 9.2.3.

### 6.2.3 Test purpose

The test purpose is to verify the ability to accurately generate and
direct radiated power per beam, across the frequency range and under
normal conditions, for all declared beams of the *IAB-DU type 1-H,
IAB-DU type 1-O, IAB-MT type 1-H, IAB-MT type 1-O, IAB-DU type 2-O and
IAB-MT type 2-O* .

### 6.2.4 Method of test

#### 6.2.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environments:

\- Normal, see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier: B, M and T; see
clause 4.9.1.

*IAB RF bandwidth* positions to be tested for multi-carrier and/or CA:

\- B~RFBW~, M~RFBW~ and T~RFBW~ in single-band operation, see
clause 4.9.1,

\- B~RFBW~\_T\'~RFBW~ and B\'~RFBW~\_T~RFBW~ in multi-band operation,
see clause 4.9.1.

Directions to be tested:

\- OTA peak directions set reference beam direction pair (D.8), and

\- OTA peak directions set maximum steering directions (D.10).

Beams to be tested: Declared beam with the highest intended EIRP for the
narrowest intended beam corresponding to the smallest BeWθ, or for the
narrowest intended beam corresponding to the smallest BeWϕ (D.3, D.11).

> NOTE: Tests under extreme power supply conditions also test extreme
> temperatures.

#### 6.2.4.2 Procedure

For normal test environment conditions in OTA domain, the test procedure
is as follows:

> 1\) Place the IAB at the positioner.
>
> 2\) Align the manufacturer declared coordinate system orientation
> (D.2) of the IAB with the test system.
>
> 3\) Orient the positioner (and IAB) in order that the direction to be
> tested aligns with the test antenna.
>
> 4\) Configure the *beam peak direction* of the IAB according to the
> declared *beam direction pair*.
>
> 5\) Set the IAB to transmit according to the applicable test

6.3 IAB output power
--------------------

### 6.3.1 Definition and applicability

OTA IAB output power is declared as the TRP radiated requirement, with
the output power accuracy requirement defined at the RIB during the
*transmitter ON period*. TRP does not change with beamforming settings
as long as the *beam peak direction* is within the *OTA peak directions
set*. Thus the TRP accuracy requirement must be met for any beamforming
setting for which the *beam peak direction* is within the *OTA peak
directions set*. Declarations are made separately for IAB-DU and IAB-MT.

The IAB *rated carrier TRP output power* for *IAB type 1-O* shall be
within limits as specified in table 6.3.1-1 for *IAB-DU type 1-O* and in
table 6.3.1-2 for *IAB-MT type 1-O*.

  NOTE: There is no upper limit for the **P~rated,c,TRP~** of the Wide Area IAB-MT.   

There is no upper limit for the *rated carrier TRP output power* of *IAB
type 2-O*.

Despite the general requirements for the IAB output power described in
clauses 6.3.2 -- 6.3.3, additional regional requirements might be
applicable.

NOTE: In certain regions, power limits corresponding to IAB classes may
apply for *IAB type 2-O*.

### 6.3.2 Minimum requirement

The minimum requirement for *IAB-DU type 1-O and IAB-MT type 1-O* is in
TS 38.174 \[2\], clause 6.3.2.

#### 6.3.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: Normal, see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier: B, M, T; see clause 4.9.1.

*IAB RF Bandwidth* positions to be tested for multi-carrier and/or CA:

\- B~RFBW~, M~RFBW~ and T~RFBW~ in single band operation; see

\- B~RFBW~\_T\'~RFBW~ and B\'~RFBW~\_T~RFBW~ in multi-band operation,
see clause 4.9.1.

Beams to be tested:

As the requirement is TRP the beam pattern(s) may be set up to optimise
the TRP measurement procedure (see annex I) as long as the required TRP
level is achieved.

#### 6.3.4.2 Procedure

The following procedure for measuring TRP is based on the directional
power measurements as described in annex I. An alternative method to
measure TRP is to use a characterized and calibrated reverberation
chamber if so follow steps 1, 3, 5, and 7.

> 1\) Place the IAB at the positioner.
>
> 2\) Align the manufacturer declared coordinate system orientation
> (D.2) of the IAB with the test system.
>
> 3\) Configure the IAB such that the beam peak direction(s) applied
> during the power measurement step 6 are consistent with the grid and
> measurement approach for the TRP test.
>
> 4\) Set the IAB to transmit according to the applicable test
> configuration in clause 4.8 using the corresponding test model(s) in
> clause 4.9.2.
>
> For a IAB declared to be capable of multi-carrier and/or CA operation
> use the applicable test signal configuration and corresponding power
> setting specified in clauses 4.7.2 and 4.8 using the corresponding
> test model(s) in clause 4.9.2 on all carriers configured.
>
> 5\) Orient the positioner (and IAB) in order that the direction to be
> tested aligns with the test antenna such that measurements to
> determine TRP can be performed (see annex I).
>
> 6\) Measure the radiated power for any two orthogonal polarizations
> (denoted p1 and p2) and calculate total radiated transmit power for
> particular beam direction pair as EIRP = EIRPp1 + EIRPp2.
>
> If the test chamber is a reverberation chamber measure TRP directly.
>
> 7\) Repeat step 6-7 for all directions in the appropriated TRP
> measurement grid needed for full TRP estimation (see annex I).
>
> 8\) Calculate TRP using the EIRP measurements.

For *multi-band RIBs* and single band tests, repeat the steps above per
involved band where single band test configurations and test models
shall apply with no carriers activated in the other band.

  NOTE: These percentages are informative and apply to all OFDM symbols within subframe except for symbol 0 of slot 0 and slot 2. Symbol 0 of slot 0 and slot 2 may have a longer CP and therefore a lower percentage.

##### 6.6.3.5.2 *IAB-DU type 2-O* and *IAB-MT type 2-O*

For *IAB-DU type 2-O and IAB-MT type 2-O*, the EVM of each NR carrier
for different modulation schemes on PDSCH or PUSCH shall be less than
the limits in table 6.6.3.5.2-1.

  NOTE: 256QAM is not supported by FR2 IAB-MT PUSCH   

EVM requirements shall apply for each NR carrier over all allocated
resource blocks and downlink slots for IAB-DU or uplink slots for
IAB-MT. PT-RS should be configured for localized setting for every
fourth symbol for every second RB for IAB-DU and IAB-MT. Different
modulation schemes listed in table 6.6.3.5.2-1 shall be considered for
rank 1.

For all bandwidths, the EVM measurement shall be performed for each NR
carrier over all allocated resource blocks and downlink slots for IAB-DU
or uplink slots for IAB-MT within 10 ms measurement periods. The
boundaries of the EVM measurement periods need not be aligned with radio
frame boundaries.

Tables 6.6.3.5.2-2 and 6.6.3.5.2-3 below specify the EVM window length
(*W*) for normal CP for *IAB-DU type 2-O* and *IAB-MT type 2-O*.

### 6.6.4 OTA time alignment error

#### 6.6.4.1 Definition and applicability

For IAB-DU, this requirement shall apply to frame timing in MIMO
transmission, carrier aggregation and their combinations. There\'s no
time alignment error requirement for IAB-MT.

Frames of the NR signals present in the radiated domain are not
perfectly aligned in time. In relation to each other, the RF signals
present in the radiated domain may experience certain timing
differences.

For a specific set of signals/transmitter configuration/transmission
mode, the OTA Time Alignment Error (OTA TAE) is defined as the largest
timing difference between any two different NR signals. The OTA time
alignment error requirement is defined as a *directional requirement* at
the RIB and shall be met within the *OTA coverage range.*

#### 6.6.4.2 Minimum requirement

The minimum requirement for *IAB-DU type 1-O* is in TS 38.174 \[2\],
clause 9.6.3.1.

The minimum requirement for *IAB-DU type 2-O* is in TS 38.174 \[2\],
clause 9.6.3.1.

#### 6.6.4.3 Test purpose

To verify that the OTA time alignment error is within the limit
specified by the minimum requirement.

#### 6.6.4.4 Method of test

##### 6.6.4.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: Normal; see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier: M; see clause 4.9.1.

*IAB-DU RF Bandwidth* positions to be tested for multi-carrier and/or
CA:

\- B~RFBW~\_T\'~RFBW~ and B\'~RFBW~\_T~RFBW~ in multi-band operation,
see clause 4.9.1.

Directions to be tested: OTA coverage range reference direction (D.35).

Polarizations to be tested: For dual polarized systems the requirement
shall be tested and met considering both polarisations. If the
measurement antenna does not support dual polarization, time alignment
error shall be measured under the condition that measurement antenna is
aligned between the IAB-DU polarisations such that it receives half the
power from each polarisation.

##### 6.6.4.4.2 Procedure for IAB-DU

> 1\) Place the IAB-DU at the positioner.
>
> 2\) Align the manufacturer declared coordinate system orientation
> (D.2) of the IAB-DU with the test system.
>
> 3\) Orient the positioner (and IAB-DU) in order that the direction to
> be tested aligns with the test antenna.
>
> 4\) Configure the beamforming settings of the IAB-DU according to the
> direction of the testing.
>
> 5\) Set the *IAB-DU type 1-O* to transmit IAB-DU-FR1-TM1.1 or any DL

NOTE: For MIMO transmission, different ports may be configured in
IAB-DU-FR1-TM1.1 and IAB-DU-FR2-TM 1.1 (using DMRS ports *p* = 1000 and
1001 with CDM).

For an IAB-DU declared to be capable of single carrier operation only,
set the IAB-DU to transmit according to the applicable test
configuration in clause 4.8 using the corresponding test model at
manufacturer\'s declared rated output power, P~rated,c,TRP~.

If the IAB-DU supports intra band contiguous or non-contiguous Carrier
Aggregation set the IAB-DU to transmit using the applicable test
configuration and corresponding power setting specified in clauses 4.7.2
and 4.8.

If the IAB-DU supports inter band carrier aggregation set the IAB-DU to
transmit, for each band, a single carrier or all carriers, using the
applicable test configuration and corresponding power setting specified
in clauses 4.7.2 and 4.8.

For *IAB-DU type 1-O* declared to be capable of multi-carrier operation,
set the IAB-DU to transmit according to the applicable test signal
configuration and corresponding power setting specified in clauses 4.7.2
and 4.8 using the corresponding test model on all carriers configured.

For *IAB-DU type 2-O* declared to be capable of multi-carrier operation,
set the IAB-DU to transmit according to the applicable test signal
configuration and corresponding power setting specified in clauses 4.7.2
and 4.8 using the corresponding test model on all carriers configured.

6\) Measure the time alignment error between the different reference
symbols on different beams on the carrier(s).

In addition, for a multi-band RIB, the following steps shall apply:

7\) For a multi-band RIB and single band tests, repeat the steps above
per involved band where single band test configurations and test models
shall apply with no carrier activated in the other band.

#### 6.6.4.5 Test Requirement

##### 6.6.4.5.1 *IAB-DU type 1-O*

For MIMO transmission, at each carrier frequency, OTA TAE shall not
exceed 90 ns.

For intra-band contiguous carrier aggregation, with or without MIMO, OTA
TAE shall not exceed 285 ns.

For intra-band non-contiguous carrier aggregation, with or without MIMO,
OTA TAE shall not exceed 3.025 µs.

For inter-band carrier aggregation, with or without MIMO, OTA TAE shall
not exceed 3.025 µs.

##### 6.6.4.5.2 *IAB-DU type 2-O*

For MIMO transmission, at each carrier frequency, OTA TAE shall not
exceed 90 ns.

For intra-band contiguous carrier aggregation, with or without MIMO, OTA
TAE shall not exceed 155 ns.

For intra-band non-contiguous carrier aggregation, with or without MIMO,
OTA TAE shall not exceed 285 ns.

For inter-band carrier aggregation, with or without MIMO, OTA TAE shall
not exceed 3.025 µs.

6.7 OTA unwanted emissions
--------------------------

### 6.7.1 General

Unwanted emissions consist of so-called out-of-band emissions and
spurious emissions according to ITU definitions ITU-R SM.329 \[10\]. In
ITU terminology, out of band emissions are unwanted emissions
immediately outside the *channel bandwidth* resulting from the
modulation process and non-linearity in the transmitter but excluding
spurious emissions. Spurious emissions are emissions which are caused by
unwanted transmitter effects such as harmonics emission, parasitic
emission, intermodulation products and frequency conversion products,
but exclude out of band emissions.

The OTA out-of-band emissions requirement for the *IAB-MT type 1-O.
IAB-DU type 1-O, IAB-DU type 1-O* and *IAB-DU type 2-O* transmitter is
specified both in terms of Adjacent Channel Leakage power Ratio (ACLR)
and operating band unwanted emissions (OBUE). OTA Unwanted emissions
outside of this frequency range are limited by an OTA spurious emissions
requirement.

The maximum offset of the operating band unwanted emissions mask from
the *operating band* edge is Δf~OBUE~. The value of Δf~OBUE~ is defined
in table 6.7.1-1 *IAB-DU type 1-O* and *type 2-O* and in table 6.7.1-2
*IAB-MT type 1-O* and *type 2-O* for NR *operating bands*.

Table 6.7.1-1: Maximum offset Δf~OBUE~ outside the downlink *operating
band for IAB-DU*

  **IAB-DU type**     ***Operating band* characteristics**          **Δf~OBUE~ (MHz)**
  ------------------- --------------------------------------------- --------------------
  *IAB-DU type 1-O*   F~DL,high~ -- F~DL,low~ \< 100 MHz            10
                      100 MHz ≤ F~DL,high~ -- F~DL,low~ ≤ 900 MHz   40
  *IAB-DU type 2-O*   F~DL,high~ -- F~DL,low~ ≤ 4000 MHz            1500

Table 6.7.1-2: Maximum offset Δf~OBUE~ outside the uplink *operating
band for IAB-MT*

  **IAB-MT type**     ***Operating band* characteristics**          **Δf~OBUE~ (MHz)**
  ------------------- --------------------------------------------- --------------------
  *IAB-MT type 1-O*   F~UL,high~ -- F~UL,low~ \< 100 MHz            10
                      100 MHz ≤ F~UL,high~ -- F~UL,low~ ≤ 900 MHz   40
  *IAB-MT type 2-O*   F~UL,high~ -- F~UL,low~ ≤ 4000 MHz            1500

The unwanted emission requirements are applied per cell for all the
configurations. Requirements for OTA unwanted emissions are captured
using TRP, *directional requirements* or co-location requirements as
described per requirement.

There is in addition a requirement for occupied bandwidth.

### 6.7.2 OTA occupied bandwidth

#### 6.7.2.1 Definition and applicability

The OTA occupied bandwidth is the width of a frequency band such that,
below the lower and above the upper frequency limits, the mean powers
emitted are each equal to a specified percentage β/2 of the total mean
transmitted power. See also recommendation ITU-R SM.328 \[13\].

The value of β/2 shall be taken as 0.5%.

The OTA occupied bandwidth requirement shall apply during the
*transmitter ON period* for a single transmitted carrier. The minimum
requirement below may be applied regionally. There may also be regional
requirements to declare the OTA occupied bandwidth according to the
definition in the present clause.

The OTA occupied bandwidth is defined as a *directional requirement* and
shall be met in the manufacturer\'s declared *OTA coverage range* at the
RIB.

#### 6.7.2.2 Minimum requirement

The minimum requirement for *IAB-DU type 1-O and IAB-DU type 2-O* are in
TS 38.174 \[2\], clause 9.7.2.2.

The minimum requirement for *IAB-MT type 1-O and IAB-MT type 2-O* are in
TS 38.174 \[2\], clause 9.7.2.3.

#### 6.7.2.3 Test purpose

The test purpose is to verify that the emission at the *RIB* does not
occupy an excessive bandwidth for the service to be provided and is,
therefore, not likely to create interference to other users of the
spectrum beyond undue limits.

#### 6.7.2.4 Method of test

##### 6.7.2.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: Normal, see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier: M; see clause 4.9.1.

Directions to be tested: OTA coverage range reference direction (D.35).

Beams to be tested: Declared beam with the highest intended EIRP for the
narrowest intended beam corresponding to the smallest BeWθ, or for the
narrowest intended beam corresponding to the smallest BeWϕ (D.3, D.11).

*Aggregated IAB channel bandwidth* positions to be tested for contiguous
carrier aggregation: M~BW\ Channel\ CA~; see clause 4.9.1.

For a IAB declared to be capable of single carrier operation, start
transmission according to the applicable test configuration in
clause 4.8 using the corresponding test model IAB-DU-FR1-TM1.1 for
*IAB-DU type 1-O, IAB-MT-FR1-TM1.1* for *IAB-MT type 1-O,
IAB-DU-FR2-TM1.1* for *IAB-DU type 2-O* or IAB-MT-FR2-TM1.1 for *IAB-MT
type 2-O* in clause 4.9.2 at manufacturers declared rated carrier EIRP
(P~rated,c,EIRP~, D.11).

For a IAB declared to be capable of contiguous carrier aggregation
operation, set the IAB to transmit according to IABDU-FR1-TM1.1 for
*IAB-DU type 1-O, IAB-MT-FR1-TM1.1 for IAB-MT type 1-O,*
IAB-DU-FR2-TM1.1 for *IAB-DU type 2-O* or IAB-MT-FR2-TM1.1 for *IAB-MT
type 2-O* in clause 4.9.2 on all carriers configured using the
applicable test configuration and corresponding power setting specified
in clauses 4.7.2.3.1 and 4.8.

##### 6.7.2.4.2 Procedure

> 1\) Place the IAB at the positioner.
>
> 2\) Align the manufacturer declared coordinate system orientation
> (D.2) of the IAB with the test system.
>
> 3\) Orient the positioner (and IAB) in order that the direction to be
> tested aligns with the test antenna..
>
> 4\) Configure the beam peak direction of the IAB according to the
> declared beam direction pair.
>
> 5\) Set the IAB to transmit signal.
>
> 6\) Measure the spectrum emission of the transmitted signal using at
> least the number of measurement points, and across a span, as listed
> in table 6.7.2.4.2-1 and table 6.7.2.4.2-2. The selected resolution
> bandwidth (RBW) filter of the analyser shall be 30 kHz or less.

NOTE: The detection mode of the spectrum analyser will not have any
effect on the result if the statistical properties of the out-of-OBW
power are the same as those of the inside-OBW power. Both are expected
to have the Rayleigh distribution of the amplitude of Gaussian noise. In
any case where the statistics are not the same, though, the detection
mode is power responding. There are at least two ways to be power
responding. The spectrum analyser can be set to \"sample\" detection,
with its video bandwidth setting at least three times its RBW setting.
Or the analyser may be set to respond to the average of the power
(root-mean-square of the voltage) across the measurement cell.

#### 6.7.2.5 Test requirement

##### 6.7.2.5.1 *IAB-DU type 1-O and IAB-DU type 2-O*

The OTA occupied bandwidth for each NR carrier shall be less than the
*IAB-DU channel bandwidth*. For intra-band contiguous CA, t**he OTA
occupied bandwidth shall be less than or equal to the *Aggregated IAB-DU
Channel Bandwidth.***

##### 6.7.2.5.2 *IAB-MT type 1-O and IAB-MT type 2-O*

The OTA occupied bandwidth for each NR carrier shall be less than the
*IAB-MT channel bandwidth*. For intra-band contiguous CA, t**he OTA
occupied bandwidth shall be less than or equal to the *Aggregated IAB-MT
Channel Bandwidth.***

### 6.7.3 OTA Adjacent Channel Leakage Power Ratio (ACLR)

#### 6.7.3.1 Definition and applicability

OTA Adjacent Channel Leakage power Ratio (ACLR) is the ratio of the
filtered mean power centred on the assigned channel frequency to the
filtered mean power centred on an adjacent channel frequency. The
measured power is TRP.

The requirement shall be applied per RIB during the *transmitter ON
period*.

#### 6.7.3.2 Minimum requirement

The minimum requirement for *IAB-DU type 1-O and IAB-MT type 1-O* is in
TS 38.174 \[2\], clause 9.7.3.2.

The minimum requirement for *IAB-DU type 2-O and Wide Area IAB-MT type
2-O* is in TS 38.174 \[2\], clause 9.7.3.3.

#### 6.7.3.3 Test purpose

To verify that the OTA adjacent channel leakage ratio requirement shall
be met as specified by the minimum requirement.

#### 6.7.3.4 Method of test

##### 6.7.3.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: normal; see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier: B and T; see clause 4.9.1.

*IAB RF Bandwidth* positions to be tested for multi-carrier and/or CA:

\- B~RFBW~ and T~RFBW~ in single-band operation, see clause 4.9.1;

\- B~RFBW~\_T\'~RFBW~ and B\'~RFBW~\_T~RFBW~ in multi-band operation,
see clause 4.9.1.

Directions to be tested: As the requirement is TRP the beam pattern(s)
may be set up to optimise the TRP measurement procedure (see annex I) as
long as the required TRP level is achieved.

##### 6.7.3.4.2 Procedure

The following procedure for measuring TRP is based on the directional
power measurements as described in annex I. An alternative method to
measure TRP is to use a characterized and calibrated reverberation
chamber if so follow steps 1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 and 13.

> 1\) Place the IAB at the positioner.
>
> 2\) Align the manufacturer declared coordinate system orientation
> (D.2) of the IAB with the test system.
>
> 3\) The measurement devices characteristics shall be:
>
> \- measurement filter bandwidth: defined in clause 6.7.3.5.
>
> \- detection mode: true RMS voltage or true power averaging.
>
> 4\) For single carrier operation, set the IAB to transmit according to
> the applicable test configuration in clause 4.8 using the
> corresponding test model(s) in clause 4.9.2 at manufacturers declared
> *rated carrier output power* (P~rated,c,TRP~).
>
> For a IAB declared to be capable of multi-carrier and/or CA operation
> use the applicable test signal configuration and corresponding power
> setting specified in clauses 4.7.2 and 4.8 using the corresponding
> test model(s) in clause 4.9.2 on all carriers configured.
>
> 5\) Orient the positioner (and IAB) in order that the direction to be
> tested aligns with the test antenna such that measurements to
> determine TRP can be performed (see annex I).
>
> 6\) Measure the absolute power of the assigned channel frequency and
> the (adjacent channel frequency).
>
> 7\) Repeat step 5-6 for all directions in the appropriated TRP
> measurement grid needed for TRP~Estimate~ (see annex I).
>
> 8\) Calculate TRP~Estimate~ for the absolute total radiated power of
> the wanted channel and the adjacent channel using the measurements
> made in Step 7.
>
> 9\) Calculate relative ACLR estimate.

NOTE 1: ACLR is calculated by the ratio of the absolute TRP of the
assigned channel frequency and the absolute TRP of the adjacent
frequency channel.

NOTE 2: For FR1 the measurement uncertainty of the reverberation chamber
for the relative ACLR is higher than the measurement uncertainty in
clause 4.1.2 the test requirements in table 6.7.3.5.1-1 shall be
tightened following the procedure in clause 4.1.3.

> 10\) Measure OTA ACLR for the frequency offsets both side of channel
> frequency as specified in table 6.7.3.5.1-1 for *IAB type 1-O* or
> table 6.7.3.5.2-1for *IAB type 2-O* respectively. In multiple carrier
> case only offset frequencies below the lowest and above the highest
> carrier frequency used shall be measured.
>
> 11\) For the OTA ACLR requirement applied inside sub-block gap for
> non-contiguous spectrum operation or inside *Inter RF Bandwidth gap*
> for multi-band operation:
>
> a\) Measure OTA ACLR inside sub-block gap or *Inter RF Bandwidth gap*,
> if applicable.
>
> b\) Measure OTA CACLR inside sub-block gap or *Inter RF Bandwidth
> gap*, if applicable.
>
> 12\) Repeat the test with the channel set-up using IAB- FR1-TM1.2
> defined in clause 4.9.2 in TS 38.176-1 \[3\] for *IAB type 1-O*.

In addition, for *multi-band RIB*, the following steps shall apply:

> 13\) For *IAB type 1-O* and *multi-band RIB* and single band tests,
> repeat the steps above per involved band where single band test
> configurations and test models shall apply with no carrier activated
> in the other band.

#### 6.7.3.5 Test requirements

##### 6.7.3.5.1 *IAB-DU type 1-O and IAB-MT type 1-O*

For the OTA ACLR requirement either the OTA ACLR limits in tables
6.7.3.5.1-1/3 or the OTA ACLR absolute limits in table 6.7.3.5.1-2 shall
apply, whichever is less stringent. The OTA CACLR limits in table
6.7.3.5.1-4 or the OTA CACLR absolute limits in table 6.7.3.5.1-5 shall
apply, whichever is less stringent.

The CACLR in a sub-block gap and Inter RF Bandwidth gap is the ratio of:

a\) the sum of the filtered mean power centred on the assigned channel
frequencies for the two carriers adjacent to each side of the sub-block
gap or the Inter RF Bandwidth gap, and

b\) the filtered mean power centred on a frequency channel adjacent to
one of the respective sub-block edges or Base Station RF Bandwidth
edges.

The assumed filter for the adjacent channel frequency is defined in
table 6.7.3.5.1-4 and the filters on the assigned channels are defined
in table 6.7.3.5.1-6.

For operation in paired and unpaired spectrum, the OTA ACLR measurement
result shall not be less than the OTA ACLR limit specified in table
6.7.3.5.1-1.

##### 6.7.3.5.2 *IAB-DU type 2-O and Wide Area IAB-MT type 2-O*

The OTA ACLR absolute limit in table 6.7.3.5.2-2 or the OTA ACLR limit
in table 6.7.3.5.2-1/3, whichever is less stringent, shall apply. The
OTA CACLR absolute limit in table 6.7.3.5.2-5 or the OTA CACLR limit in
table 6.7.3.5.2-4, whichever is less stringent, shall apply.

For a *RIB* operating in multi-carrier or contiguous CA, the OTA ACLR
requirements in table 6.7.3.5.2-1 shall apply to *IAB-DU* and *IAB-MT
channel bandwidths* of the outermost carrier for the frequency ranges
defined in the table. For a RIB operating in *non-contiguous spectrum*,
the OTA ACLR requirement in table 6.7.3.5.2-3 shall apply in *sub-block
gaps* for the frequency ranges defined in the table, while the OTA CACLR
requirement in table 6.7.3.5.2-4 shall apply in *sub-block gaps* for the
frequency ranges defined in the table.

The CACLR in a *sub-block gap* is the ratio of:

a\) the sum of the filtered mean power centred on the assigned channel
frequencies for the two carriers adjacent to each side of the *sub-block
gap*, and

b\) the filtered mean power centred on a frequency channel adjacent to
one of the respective *sub-block* edges.

The assumed filter for the adjacent channel frequency is defined in
table 6.7.3.5.2-4 and the filters on the assigned channels are defined
in table 6.7.3.5.2-6.

For operation in *non-contiguous spectrum*, the CACLR for NR carriers
located on either side of the *sub-block gap* shall be higher than the
value specified in table 6.7.3.5.2-4.

##### 6.7.3.5.3 *Local Area IAB-MT type 2-O*

The OTA ACLR absolute limit in table 6.7.3.5.3-2 or the ACLR limit in
table 6.7.3.5.3-1/3, whichever is less stringent, shall apply. The OTA
CACLR absolute limit in table 6.7.3.5.3-5 or the CACLR limit in table
6.7.3.5.3-4, whichever is less stringent, shall apply.

Requirements specified for Local Area *IAB-DU type 2-O* in clause
6.7.3.5.3 shall apply to Local Area *IAB-MT type 2-O* during
transmission in DL timeslot.

For a *RIB* operating in multi-carrier or contiguous CA, the OTA ACLR
requirements in table 6.7.3.5.3-1 shall apply to *IAB-MT channel
bandwidths* of the outermost carrier for the frequency ranges defined in
the table. For a RIB operating in *non-contiguous spectrum*, the OTA
ACLR requirement in table 6.7.3.5.3-3 shall apply in *sub-block gaps*
for the frequency ranges defined in the table, while the OTA CACLR
requirement in table 6.7.3.5.3-4 shall apply in *sub-block gaps* for the
frequency ranges defined in the table.

The CACLR in a *sub-block gap* is the ratio of:

> a\) the sum of the filtered mean power centred on the assigned channel
> frequencies for the two carriers adjacent to each side of the
> *sub-block gap*, and
>
> b\) the filtered mean power centred on a frequency channel adjacent to
> one of the respective *sub-block* edges.

The assumed filter for the adjacent channel frequency is defined in
table 6.7.3.5.3-4 and the filters on the assigned channels are defined
in table 6.7.3.5.3-6.

For operation in *non-contiguous spectrum*, the CACLR for NR carriers
located on either side of the *sub-block gap* shall be higher than the
value specified in table 6.7.3.5.3-4.

### 6.7.4 OTA operating band unwanted emissions 

#### 6.7.4.1 Definition and applicability

The OTA limits for operating band unwanted emissions are specified as
TRP per RIB, unless otherwise stated.

##### 6.7.4.1.1 *IAB-DU type 1-O*

For *IAB-DU type 1-O*, for a *RIB* operating in multi-carrier or
contiguous CA, the requirements apply to *IAB-DU channel bandwidths* of
the outermost carrier. In addition, for a *RIB* operating in
non-contiguous spectrum, the requirements shall apply inside any
sub-block gap. In addition, for a *multi-band RIB*, the requirements
shall apply inside any Inter RF Bandwidth gap.

##### 6.7.4.1.2 *IAB-MT type 1-O*

For *IAB-MT type 1-O*, for a *RIB* operating in multi-carrier or
contiguous CA, the requirements apply to *IAB-MT channel bandwidths* of
the outermost carrier. In addition, for a *RIB* operating in
non-contiguous spectrum, the requirements shall apply inside any
sub-block gap. In addition, for a *multi-band RIB*, the requirements
shall apply inside any Inter RF Bandwidth gap.

##### 6.7.4.1. 3 *IAB-DU type 2-O* and *IAB-MT type 2-O*

For *IAB-DU type 2-O* and *IAB-MT type 2-O*, for a *RIB* operating in
multi-carrier or contiguous CA, the requirements apply to the
frequencies (Δf~OBUE~) starting from the edge of the *contiguous
transmission bandwidth.* In addition, for a *RIB* operating in
non-contiguous spectrum, the requirements apply inside any sub-block
gap.

#### 6.7.4.2 Minimum requirement

The minimum requirement for *IAB-DU type 1-O* is defined in
TS 38.174 \[2\], clause 9.7.4.2.

The minimum requirement for IA*B-MT type 1-O* is defined in
TS 38.174 \[2\], clause 9.7.4.3.

The minimum requirement for IA*B-DU type 2-O* and IA*B-MT type 2-O* are
defined in TS 38.174 \[2\], clause 9.7.4.5.

#### 6.7.4.3 Test purpose

This test measures the emissions of the IAB-Node, close to the assigned
channel bandwidth of the wanted signal, while the IAB-Node is in
operation.

#### 6.7.4.4 Method of test

##### 6.7.4.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: normal; see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier: B, M and T; see
clause 4.9.1.

*IAB RF Bandwidth* positions to be tested for multi-carrier and/or CA:

\- B~RFBW~, M~RFBW~ and T~RFBW~ in single-band operation, see
clause 4.9.1;

\- B~RFBW~\_T\'~RFBW~ and B\'~RFBW~\_T~RFBW~ in multi-band operation,
see clause 4.9.1.

Directions to be tested: As the requirement is TRP the beam pattern(s)
may be set up to optimise the TRP measurement procedure (see annex I) as
long as the required TRP level is achieved.

##### 6.7.4.4.2 Procedure

The following procedure for measuring TRP is based on the directional
power measurements as described in annex I. An alternative method to
measure TRP is to use a characterized and calibrated reverberation
chamber if so follow steps 1, 3, 4, 6 and 9.

> 1\) Place the IAB-Node at the positioner.
>
> 2\) Align the manufacturer declared coordinate system orientation
> (D.2) of the IAB-Node with the test system.
>
> 3\) The measurement devices characteristics shall be:
>
> \- measurement filter bandwidth: defined in clause 6.7.4.5.
>
> \- detection mode: true RMS voltage or true power averaging.
>
> 4\) For single carrier operation, set the IAB-Node to transmit
> according to the applicable test configuration in clause 4.8 using the
> corresponding test model(s) in clause 4.9.2 at manufacturers declared
> *rated carrier output power* (P~rated,c,TRP~).
>
> For a IAB declared to be capable of multi-carrier and/or CA operation,
> use the applicable test signal configuration and corresponding power
> setting specified in clause 4.7.2 and 4.8 using the corresponding test
> model(s) in clause 4.9.2 on all carriers configured.
>
> 5\) Orient the positioner (and IAB) in order that the direction to be
> tested aligns with the test antenna such that measurements to
> determine TRP can be performed (see annex I).
>
> 6\) Sweep the centre frequency of the measurement filter in contiguous
> steps and measure emission power within the specified frequency ranges
> with the specified measurement bandwidth.
>
> 7\) Repeat step 5-6 for all directions in the appropriated TRP
> measurement grid needed for TRP~Estimate~ (see annex I).
>
> 8\) Calculate TRP~Estimate~ using the measurements made in step 6.
>
> 9\) For *IAB type 1-O* and *multi-band RIB* and single band tests,
> repeat the steps above per involved band where single band test
> configurations and test models shall apply with no carrier activated
> in the other band.

#### 6.7.4.5 Test requirements

##### 6.7.4.5.1 *IAB* *type 1-O*

The emission measurement result shall not exceed the maximum levels
specified in tables 6.7.4.5.1.1-1 to 6.7.4.5.1.5-3, where:

\- ∆f is the separation between the channel edge frequency and the
nominal -3dB point of the measuring filter closest to the carrier
frequency.

\- f\_offset is the separation between the channel edge frequency and
the centre of the measuring filter.

\- f\_offset~max~ is the offset to the frequency Δf~OBUE~ MHz outside
the downlink operating band.

\- ∆f~max~ is equal to f\_offset~max~ minus half of the bandwidth of the
measuring filter.

For a *multi-band RIB* inside any *Inter RF Bandwidth gaps* with W~gap~
\< 2\*Δf~OBUE~, emissions shall not exceed the cumulative sum of the
test requirements specified at the *IAB RF Bandwidth edges* on each side
of the *Inter RF Bandwidth gap*. The test requirement for *IAB RF
Bandwidth edge* is specified in the tables 6.7.4.5.1.1-1 to
6.7.4.5.1.5-3 below, where in this case:

\- ∆f is the separation between the *IAB RF Bandwidth edge* frequency
and the nominal -3 dB point of the measuring filter closest to the *IAB
RF Bandwidth edge*.

\- f\_offset is the separation between the *IAB RF Bandwidth edge*
frequency and the centre of the measuring filter.

\- f\_offset~max~ is equal to the *Inter RF Bandwidth gap* minus half of
the bandwidth of the measuring filter.

\- ∆f~max~ is equal to f\_offset~max~ minus half of the bandwidth of the
measuring filter.

For a *multi-band RIB*, the operating band unwanted emission limits
apply also in a supported operating band without any carrier
transmitted, in the case where there are carrier(s) transmitted in
another supported operating band. In this case, no cumulative limit is
applied in the *inter-band gap* between a supported downlink operating
band with carrier(s) transmitted and a supported downlink operating band
without any carrier transmitted and

\- In case the *inter-band gap* between a supported downlink operating
band with carrier(s) transmitted and a supported downlink operating band
without any carrier transmitted is less than 2\*Δf~OBUE~, f\_offset~max~
shall be the offset to the frequency Δf~OBUE~ MHz outside the outermost
edges of the two supported downlink operating bands and the operating
band unwanted emission limit of the band where there are carriers
transmitted, as defined in the tables of the present clause, shall apply
across both downlink bands.

\- In other cases, the operating band unwanted emission limit of the
band where there are carriers transmitted, as defined in the tables of
the present clause for the largest frequency offset (∆f~max~), shall
apply from Δf~OBUE~ MHz below the lowest frequency, up to Δf~OBUE~ MHz
above the highest frequency of the supported downlink operating band
without any carrier transmitted.

For a multicarrier *single-band RIB* or a *single-band RIB* configured
for intra-band contiguous or non-contiguous carrier aggregation the
definitions above apply to the lower edge of the carrier transmitted at
the lowest carrier frequency and the upper edge of the carrier
transmitted at the highest carrier frequency within a specified
frequency band.

In addition inside any sub-block gap for a *single-band RIB* operating
in non-contiguous spectrum, emissions shall not exceed the cumulative
sum of the test requirements specified for the adjacent sub blocks on
each side of the sub block gap. The test requirement for each sub block
is specified in the tables 6.7.4.5.1.1-1 to 6.7.4.5.1.5-3 below, where
in this case:

\- ∆f is the separation between the sub block edge frequency and the
nominal -3 dB point of the measuring filter closest to the sub block
edge.

\- f\_offset is the separation between the sub block edge frequency and
the centre of the measuring filter.

\- f\_offset~max~ is equal to the sub block gap bandwidth minus half of
the bandwidth of the measuring filter.

\- ∆f~max~ is equal to f\_offset~max~ minus half of the bandwidth of the
measuring filter.

##### 6.7.4.5.1.1 Wide Area IAB-DU and Wide Area IAB-MT (Category A) {#wide-area-iab-du-and-wide-area-iab-mt-category-a .H6}

For operating in Bands n41, n77, n78, n79, emissions shall not exceed
the maximum levels specified in tables 6.7.4.5.1.1-1 to 6.7.4.5.1.1-3:

##### 6.7.4.6.3 Additional requirements

##### 6.7.4.6.3.1 Limits in FCC Title 47 {#limits-in-fcc-title-47 .H6}

In addition to the requirements in clauses 6.6.4.2.1, 6.6.4.2.2,
6.6.4.2.3 and 6.6.4.2.4 in TS 38.174 \[2\], the IAB-DU and IAB-MT may
have to comply with the applicable emission limits established by FCC
Title 47 \[14\], when deployed in regions where those limits are
applied, and under the conditions declared by the manufacturer.

##### 6.7.4.6.4 *IAB type 2-O*

The requirements of either clause 6.7.4.6.4.1 (Category A limits) or
clause 6.7.4.6.4.1 (Category B limits) shall apply. The application of
either Category A or Category B limits shall be the same as for General
OTA transmitter spurious emissions requirements (*IAB type 2-O*) in
clause 6.7.5.2.5.2. In addition, the limits in clause 6.7.4.5.2.4 may
also apply. The emission measurement result shall not exceed the maximum
levels specified in the tables below, where:

\- ∆f is the separation between the *contiguous transmission bandwidth*
edge frequency and the nominal -3dB point of the measuring filter
closest to the *contiguous transmission bandwidth* edge.

\- f\_offset is the separation between the *contiguous transmission
bandwidth* edge frequency and the centre of the measuring filter.

\- f\_offset~max~ is the offset to the frequency Δf~OBUE~ outside the
downlink *operating band*, where Δf~OBUE~ is defined in table 6.7.1-1.

In addition, inside any sub-block gap for a *RIB* operating in
non-contiguous spectrum, emissions shall not exceed the cumulative sum
of the **test requirements** specified for the adjacent sub blocks on
each side of the sub block gap. The test requirement for each sub-block
is specified in the clauses 6.7.4.5.2.2 and 6.7.4.5.2.3 below, where in
this case:

\- ∆f is the separation between the sub block edge frequency and the
nominal -3 dB point of the measuring filter closest to the sub block
edge.

\- f\_offset is the separation between the sub block edge frequency and
the centre of the measuring filter.

\- f\_offset~max~ is equal to the sub block gap bandwidth minus half of
the bandwidth of the measuring filter.

\- ∆f~max~ is equal to f\_offset~max~ minus half of the bandwidth of the
measuring filter.

##### 6.7.4.6.4.1 OTA operating band unwanted emission limits (Category A) {#ota-operating-band-unwanted-emission-limits-category-a .H6}

The power of unwanted emission of IAB-DU shall not exceed the limits in
table 6.7.4.6.4.1-1 or 6.7.4.6.4.1-2. The power of unwanted emission of
IAB-MT shall not exceed the limits in table 6.7.4.6.4.1-3 or
6.7.4.6.4.1-4.

### 6.7.5 OTA transmitter spurious emissions

#### 6.7.5.1 General 

For IAB-DU, the OTA transmitter spurious emission limits for FR1 shall
apply from 30 MHz to 12.75 GHz, excluding the frequency range from
Δf~OBUE~ below the lowest frequency of each supported downlink
*operating band*, up to Δf~OBUE~ above the highest frequency of each
supported downlink *operating band*, where the Δf~OBUE~ is defined in
table 9.7.1-1. For some FR1 *operating bands*, the upper limit is higher
than 12.75 GHz in order to comply with the 5^th^ harmonic limit of the
downlink *operating band*, as specified in Recommendation ITU-R SM.329
\[10\].

For IAB-MT, the OTA transmitter spurious emission limits for FR1 shall
apply from 30 MHz to 12.75 GHz, excluding the frequency range from
Δf~OBUE~ below the lowest frequency of each supported uplink *operating
band*, up to Δf~OBUE~ above the highest frequency of each supported
uplink *operating band*, where the Δf~OBUE~ is defined in table 9.7.1-2.
For some FR1 *operating bands*, the upper limit is higher than 12.75 GHz
in order to comply with the 5^th^ harmonic limit of the uplink
*operating band*, as specified in Recommendation ITU-R SM.329 \[10\].

For *multi-band RIB* each supported *operating band* and Δf~OBUE~ MHz
around each band are excluded from the OTA transmitter spurious
emissions requirements.

The requirements shall apply whatever the type of transmitter considered
(single carrier or multi-carrier). It applies for all transmission modes
foreseen by the manufacturer\'s specification.

*IAB-DU type 1-O* and *IAB-MT type 1-O* requirements consist of OTA
transmitter spurious emission requirements based on TRP and co-location
requirements not based on TRP.

#### 6.7.5.2 General OTA transmitter spurious emissions requirements

##### 6.7.5.2.1 Definition and applicability

The general OTA transmitter spurious emissions requirements are
specified as TRP per RIB, per cell, unless otherwise specified.

##### 6.7.5.2.2 Minimum requirement

The minimum requirement for *IAB type 1-O* is specified in
TS 38.174 \[2\], clause 9.7.5.2.

The minimum requirement for *IAB type 2-O* is specified in
TS 38.174 \[2\], clause 9.7.5.3.

##### 6.7.5.2.3 Test purpose

The test purpose is to verify if the radiated spurious emissions from
the IAB at the RIB are within the specified minimum requirements.

Directions to be tested: As the requirement is TRP the beam pattern(s)
may be set up to optimise the TRP measurement procedure (see annex I) as
long as the required TRP level is achieved.

##### 6.7.5.2.4.2 Procedure {#procedure-8 .H6}

The following procedure for measuring TRP is based on directional power
measurements as described in annex I. An alternative method to measure
TRP is to use a characterized and calibrated reverberation chamber if so
follow steps 1, 3, 4, 5, 7 and 10.

> 1\) Place the IAB-Node at the positioner.
>
> 2\) Align the manufacturer declared coordinate system orientation
> (D.2) of the IAB with the test system.
>
> 3\) Measurements shall use a measurement bandwidth in accordance to
> the conditions in clause 6.7.5.2.5.
>
> 4\) The measurement device characteristics shall be:

\- Detection mode: True RMS.

> 5\) Set the IAB to transmit:

\- For RIB declared to be capable of single carrier operation only, set
the RIB to transmit a signal according to the applicable test
configuration in clause 4.8 using the corresponding test model in
clause 4.9.2 (i.e.IAB-DU-FR1-TM1.1 for *IAB-DU type 1-O,
IAB-MT-FR1-TM1.1* for *IAB-MT type 1-O, IAB-DU-FR2-TM1.1* for *IAB-DU
type 2-O* or IAB-MT-FR2-TM1.1 for *IAB-MT type 2-O*), at manufacturer\'s
declared rated output power P~rated,c,TRP~.

\- For a RIB declared to be capable of multi-carrier and/or CA
operation, set the RIB to transmit according to the corresponding test
model in clause 4.9.2 on all carriers configured using the applicable
test configuration and corresponding power setting specified in
clause 4.7.2 and 4.8.

> 6\) Orient the positioner (and IAB) in order that the direction to be
> tested aligns with the test antenna such that measurements to
> determine TRP can be performed (see annex I).
>
> 7\) Measure the emission at the specified frequencies with specified
> measurement bandwidth.
>
> 8\) Repeat step 6-7 for all directions in the appropriated TRP
> measurement grid needed for full TRP estimation (see annex I).

NOTE 1: The TRP measurement grid may not be the same for all measurement
frequencies.

NOTE 2: The frequency sweep or the TRP measurement grid sweep may be
done in any order.

> 9\) Calculate TRP at each specified frequency using the directional
> measurements.

In addition, for *multi-band RIB(s)*, the following steps shall apply:

> 10\) For *IAB type 1-O* and *multi-band RIBs* and single band tests,
> repeat the steps above per involved band where single band test
> configurations and test models shall apply with no carrier activated
> in the other band.

##### 6.7.5.2.5 Test requirement

##### 6.7.5.2.5.1 Test requirement for *IAB type 1-O* {#test-requirement-for-iab-type-1-o .H6}

For a IAB meeting category A the TRP of any spurious emission shall not
exceed the limits in table 6.7.5.2.5.1-1.

#### 6.7.5.3 Void

#### 6.7.5.4 Additional spurious emissions requirements

##### 6.7.5.4.1 Definition and applicability

These requirements may be applied for the protection of systems
operating in frequency ranges other than the IAB downlink operating
band. The limits may apply as an optional protection of such systems
that are deployed in the same geographical area as the IAB-Node, or they
may be set by local or regional regulation as a mandatory requirement
for an NR operating band. It is in some cases not stated in the present
document whether a requirement is mandatory or under what exact
circumstances that a limit applies, since this is set by local or
regional regulation. An overview of regional requirements in the present
document is given in clause 4.4.

Some requirements may apply for the protection of specific equipment
(UE, MS and/or BS) or equipment operating in specific systems (GSM,
CDMA, UTRA, E-UTRA, NR, etc.).

The requirement shall apply at each RIB supporting transmission in the
*operating band*.

All additional spurious requirements are TRP unless otherwise stated.

##### 6.7.5.4.2 Minimum Requirement

The minimum requirement for *IAB type 1-O* is specified in
TS 38.174 \[2\], clause 9.7.5.2.3.

The minimum requirement for *IAB type 2-O* is specified in
TS 38.174 \[2\], clause 9.7.5.3.3.

##### 6.7.5.4.3 Test purpose

The test purpose is to verify the radiated spurious emissions from the
IAB at the RIB are within the specified additional spurious emissions
requirements.

##### 6.7.5.4.4 Method of test

Directions to be tested: As the requirements are TRP the beam pattern(s)
may be set up to optimise the TRP measurement procedure (see annex I) as
long as the required TRP level is achieved.

##### 6.7.5.4.4.2 Procedure {#procedure-9 .H6}

The following procedure for measuring TRP is based on the directional
power measurements as described in annex I. An alternative method to
measure TRP is to use a characterized and calibrated reverberation
chamber if so follow steps 1, 3, 4, 5, 7 and 10.

> 1\) Place the IAB-Node at the positioner.
>
> 2\) Align the manufacturer declared coordinate system orientation
> (D.2) of the IAB with the test system.
>
> 3\) Measurements shall use a measurement bandwidth in accordance to
> the conditions in clause 6.7.5.4.5.
>
> 4\) The measurement device characteristics shall be:

\- Detection mode: True RMS.

> 5\) Set the IAB-Node to transmit:

\- For RIB declared to be capable of single carrier operation only, set
the RIB to transmit a signal according to the applicable test
configuration in clause 4.8 using the corresponding test model in
clause 4.9.2 (IAB-DU-FR1-TM1.1 for *IAB-DU type 1-O, IAB-MT-FR1-TM1.1*
for *IAB-MT type 1-O, IAB-DU-FR2-TM1.1* for *IAB-DU type 2-O* or
IAB-MT-FR2-TM1.1 for *IAB-MT type 2-O*), at manufacturer\'s declared
rated output power P~rated,c,TRP~.

\- For a RIB declared to be capable of multi-carrier and/or CA
operation, set the RIB to transmit according to IAB-DU-FR1-TM1.1 for
*IAB-DU type 1-O, IAB-MT-FR1-TM1.1* for *IAB-MT type 1-O,
IAB-DU-FR2-TM1.1* for *IAB-DU type 2-O* or IAB-MT-FR2-TM1.1 for *IAB-MT
type 2-O* in clause 4.9.2 on all carriers configured using the
applicable test configuration and corresponding power setting specified
in clause 4.7.2 and 4.8.

> 6\) Orient the positioner (and IAB) in order that the direction to be
> tested aligns with the test antenna such that measurements to
> determine TRP can be performed (see annex I).
>
> 7\) Measure the emission at the specified frequencies with specified
> measurement bandwidth.
>
> 8\) Repeat step 6-7 for all directions in the appropriated TRP
> measurement grid needed for full TRP estimation (see annex I).

NOTE 1: The TRP measurement grid may not be the same for all measurement
frequencies.

NOTE 2: The frequency sweep or the TRP measurement grid sweep may be
done in any order.

> 9\) Calculate TRP at each specified frequency using the directional
> measurements.

In addition, for *multi-band RIB(s)*, the following steps shall apply:

> 10\) For *multi-band RIBs* and single band tests, repeat the steps
> above per involved band where single band test configurations and test
> models shall apply with no carrier activated in the other band.

##### 6.7.5.4.5 Test requirement

##### 6.7.5.4.5.1 Test requirement for *IAB type 1-O* {#test-requirement-for-iab-type-1-o-1 .H6}

The power of any spurious emission shall not exceed the test limits in
table 6.7.5.4.5-1 for a IAB where requirements for co-existence with the
system listed in the first column apply. For a *multi-band RIB*, the
exclusions and conditions in the Note column of table 6.7.5.4.5-1 apply
for each supported *operating band*.

NOTE 1: As defined in the scope for spurious emissions in this clause
the co-existence requirements in table 6.7.5.4.5.1-1do not apply for the
Δf~OBUE~ frequency range immediately outside the downlink *operating
band* (see table 5.2-1). Emission limits for this excluded frequency
range may be covered by local or regional requirements.

NOTE 2: Table 6.7.5.4.5.1-1 assumes that two *operating bands*, where
the frequency ranges in table 5.2-1 would be overlapping, are not
deployed in the same geographical area. For such a case of operation
with overlapping frequency arrangements in the same geographical area,
special co-existence requirements may apply that are not covered by the
3GPP specifications.

#### 6.7.5.5 Co-location requirements

##### 6.7.5.5.1 Definition and applicability

These requirements may be applied for the protection of other BS, IAB-DU
or IAB-MT receivers when GSM900, DCS1800, PCS1900, GSM850, CDMA850, UTRA
FDD, UTRA TDD, E-UTRA, NR BS, IAB-DU or IAB-MT are co-located with
IAB-MT and/or IAB-DU.

The requirements assume a 30 dB coupling loss between transmitter and
receiver and are based on co-location with same class.

##### 6.7.5.5.2 Minimum requirements

The minimum requirement for *IAB type 1-O* is defined in TS 38.174
\[2\], clause 9.7.5.2.

##### 6.7.5.5.3 Test purpose

For OTA co-locate spurious emission, the test purpose is to verify that
the emission is within the specified requirement limits at the CLTA
conducted output(s).

##### 6.7.5.5.4 Method of test

##### 6.7.5.5.4.1 Initial conditions {#initial-conditions-14 .H6}

Test environment: normal; see clause B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier: M; see clause 4.9.1.

*IAB RF Bandwidth* positions to be tested for multi-carrier:

\- M~RFBW~ in *single-band RIB*, see clause 4.9.1;

\- B~RFBW~\_T\'~RFBW~ and B\'~RFBW~\_T~RFBW~ in *multi-band RIB*, see
clause 4.9.1.

In addition, for *multi-band RIB*:

\- For B~RFBW~\_T\'~RFBW~, emission testing above the highest operating
band may be omitted.

\- For B\'~RFBW~\_T~RFBW~, emission testing below the lowest operating
band may be omitted.

Directions to be tested: The FR1 requirement is specified as co-location
requirement. For general description of co-location requirements, refer
to clause 4.12.

The co-location spurious emission is measured at the CLTA conducted
output(s).

##### 6.7.5.5.4.2 Procedure {#procedure-10 .H6}

> 1\) Select and place the IAB-Node and CLTA as described in
> clause 4.12, with parameters as specified in table 4.12.2.2-1 and
> table 4.12.2.3-1.
>
> 2\) Several CLTAs might be required to cover the whole co-location
> spurious emission frequency ranges.
>
> 3\) Place test antenna in reference direction at far-field distance,
> aligned in all supported polarizations (single or dual) with the
> IAB-Node as depicted in annex E.1.3.
>
> 4\) The test antenna shall be dual (or single) polarized with the same
> frequency range as the IAB-Node for co-location spurious emission test
> case.
>
> 5\) Connect test antenna and CLTA to the measurement equipment as
> depicted in annex E.1.3.
>
> 6\) OTA co-location spurious emission is measured as the power sum
> over all supported polarizations at the CLTA conducted output(s).
>
> 7\) The measurement device (signal analyser) characteristics shall be:

\- Detection mode: True RMS.

> 8\) Set the *IAB type 1-O* to transmit:

\- Set the IAB-Node to transmit maximum power according to the
applicable test configuration in clause 4.8 using the corresponding test
models or set of physical channels in clause 4.9.2.

\- For the IAB-Node declared to be capable of multi-carrier and/or CA
operation, set the IAB-Node to transmit according to the applicable test
configuration and corresponding power setting specified in clause 4.7.2
and 4.8 using the corresponding test models on all carriers configured.

> 9\) Measure the emission at the specified frequencies with specified
> measurement bandwidth.

In addition, for *multi-band RIB*, the following steps shall apply:

> 10\) For *multi-band RIB* and single band tests, repeat the steps
> above per involved band where single band test configurations and test
> models shall apply with no carrier activated in the other band.

##### 6.7.5.5.5 Test requirements

##### 6.7.5.5.5.1 Test requirement for *IAB type 1-O* {#test-requirement-for-iab-type-1-o-2 .H6}

These requirements may be applied for the protection of other IAB
receivers when GSM900, DCS1800, PCS1900, GSM850, CDMA850, UTRA FDD, UTRA
TDD, E-UTRA and/or NR BS are co-located with a IAB Node.

The requirements assume co-location with base stations of the same
class.

NOTE: For co-location with UTRA, the requirements are based on
co-location with UTRA FDD or TDD base stations.

This requirement is a co-location requirement as defined in clause 4.9,
in TS 38.174 \[2\], the power levels are specified at the CLTA output.

The output of the CLTA of any spurious emission shall not exceed the
test limit in table 6.7.5.5.5.1-1.

For a *multi-band RIB*, the exclusions and conditions in the notes
column of table 6.7.5.5.5.1-1 apply for each supported operating band.

NOTE 1: As defined in the scope for spurious emissions in this clause,
the co-location requirements in table 6.6.5.2.3-1 do not apply for the
frequency range extending Δf~OBUE~ immediately outside the transmit
frequency range of a IAB-MT and IAB-DU. The current state-of-the-art
technology does not allow a single generic solution for co-location with
other system on adjacent frequencies for 30dB antenna to antenna minimum
coupling loss. However, there are certain site-engineering solutions
that can be used. These techniques are addressed in TR 25.942 \[15\].

NOTE 2: Table 6.6.5.2.3-1 assumes that two operating bands, where the
corresponding transmit and receive frequency ranges in table 5.2-1 would
be overlapping, are not deployed in the same geographical area. For such
a case of operation with overlapping frequency arrangements in the same
geographical area, special co-location requirements may apply that are
not covered by the 3GPP specifications.

6.8 OTA transmitter intermodulation
-----------------------------------

### 6.8.1 Definition and applicability

The OTA transmitter intermodulation requirement is a measure of the
capability of the transmitter unit to inhibit the generation of signals
in its non-linear elements caused by presence of the wanted signal and
an interfering signal reaching the transmitter unit via the RDN and
antenna array from a co-located base station. The requirement applies
during the *transmitter ON period* and the *transmitter transient
period*.

The requirement applies at each RIB supporting transmission in the
operating band.

The transmitter intermodulation level is the total radiated power of the
intermodulation products when an interfering signal is injected into the
CLTA.

For *IAB type 1-O*, the transmitter intermodulation requirement is
captured by the co-location transmitter intermodulation scenario case,
in which the interfering signal is injected into the CLTA.

### 6.8.2 Minimum requirement

The minimum requirement for *IAB -DU type 1-O* and *IAB -MT type 1-O* is
defined in TS 38.174 \[2\], clause 9.8.2.

The OTA transmitter intermodulation requirement is not applicable for
*IAB type 2-O*.

### 6.8.3 Test purpose

The test purpose is to verify the ability of the transmitter units
associated with the *RIB* under test to restrict the generation of
intermodulation products in its nonlinear elements caused by presence of
the wanted signal and an interfering signal reaching the transmitter
unit via the RDN and antenna array from a co-located base station to
below specified levels.

### 6.8.4 Method of test

clause 4.9.1.

In addition, for *multi-band RIB*:

\- For B~RFBW~\_T\'~RFBW~, emission testing above the highest operating
band may be omitted.

\- For B\'~RFBW~\_T~RFBW~, emission testing below the lowest operating
band may be omitted.

In addition, for *multi-band RIB,* the following steps shall apply:

> 17\) For *multi-band RIB* and single band tests, repeat the steps
> above per involved band where single band test configurations and test
> models shall apply with no carrier activated in the other band.

NOTE 1: The third order intermodulation products are centred at 2F1±F2
and 2F2±F1. The fifth order intermodulation products are centred at
3F1±2F2, 3F2±2F1, 4F1±F2, and 4F2±F1 where F1 represents the test signal
centre frequency or centre frequency of each sub-block and F2 represents
the interfering signal centre frequency. The widths of intermodulation
products are:

> \- (n\*BW~F1~ + m\* BW~F2~) for the nF1±mF2 products;
>
> \- (n\* BW~F2~ + m\* BW~F1~) for the nF2±mF1 products;
>
> where BW~F1~ represents the test wanted signal RF bandwidth or channel
> bandwidth in case of single carrier, or sub-block bandwidth and BW~F2~
> represents the interfering signal channel bandwidth.

NOTE 2: During the conformance test the interferer signal can be applied
on one side of the wanted signal, while the transmitter intermodulation
emission is measured only on the opposite side of the wanted signal.
This applies for intermodulation products which are within the operating
band or OBUE region.

### 6.8.5 Test requirements

#### 6.8.5.1 Requirement for *IAB type 1-O*

The transmitter intermodulation level shall not exceed the TRP unwanted
emission limits specified for OTA transmitter spurious emission in
clause 6.7.5 (except co-location with other base stations), OTA
out-of-band emissions in clause 6.7.4 and OTA ACLR in clause 6.7.3 in
the presence of a wanted signal and an interfering signal, defined in
table 6.8.5.1-1.

The requirement is applicable outside the *IAB RF Bandwidth edges*. The
interfering signal offset is defined relative to the *IAB RF Bandwidth*
*edges* or *Radio Bandwidth* edges.

For RIBs supporting operation in *non-contiguous spectrum*, the
requirement is also applicable inside a *sub-block gap* for interfering
signal offsets where the interfering signal falls completely within the
*sub-block gap*. The interfering signal offset is defined relative to
the *sub-block* edges.

For RIBs supporting operation in multiple *operating bands*, the
requirement shall apply relative to the *IAB RF Bandwidth* *edges* of
each *operating band*. In case the inter RF Bandwidth gap is less than
3\*BW~Channel~ MHz (where BW~Channel~ is the minimal *IAB channel
bandwidth* of the band), the requirement in the gap shall apply only for
interfering signal offsets where the interfering signal falls completely
within the inter RF Bandwidth gap.

7 Radiated receiver characteristics
===================================

7.1 General
-----------

General test conditions for receiver tests are given in clause 4,
including interpretation of measurement results and configurations for
testing. IAB configurations for the tests are defined in clause 4.5.

Unless otherwise stated, the following arrangements apply for radiated
receiver characteristics requirements in clause 7:

\- Requirements apply during the IAB receive period.

\- Requirements shall be met for any transmitter setting.

\- Throughput requirements defined for the radiated receiver
characteristics do not assume HARQ retransmissions.

\- When IAB is configured to receive multiple carriers, all the
throughput requirements are applicable for each received carrier.

\- For ACS, blocking and intermodulation characteristics, the negative
offsets of the interfering signal apply relative to the lower *IAB RF
Bandwidth* edge or *sub-block* edge inside a *sub-block gap*, and the
positive offsets of the interfering signal apply relative to the upper
*IAB RF Bandwidth* edge or *sub-block* edge inside a *sub-block gap*.

NOTE 1: In normal operating condition the IAB in TDD operation is
configured to TX OFF power during *receive period*.

Each requirement, except OTA receiver spurious emissions, shall be met
over the RoAoA specified.

For FR1 requirements which are to be met over the *OTA REFSENS RoAoA*
absolute requirement values are offset by the following term:

Δ~OTAREFSENS~ = 44.1 - 10\*log~10~(BeW~θ,REFSENS\*~BeW~φ,REFSENS~) (dB)
for the reference direction.

And

Δ~OTAREFSENS~ = 41.1 - 10\*log~10~(BeW~θ,REFSENS\*~BeW~φ,REFSENS~) (dB)
for all other directions.

For requirements which are to be met over the *minSENS RoAoA* absolute
requirement values are offset by the following term:

Δ~minSENS~ = P~REFSENS~ -- EIS~minSENS~ (dB)

For FR2 requirements which are to be met over the *OTA REFSENS RoAoA*
absolute requirement values are offset by the following term:

Δ~FR2\_REFSENS~ = -3 dB for the reference direction

and

Δ~FR2\_REFSENS~ = 0 dB for all other directions

7.2 OTA sensitivity
-------------------

### 7.2.1 Definition and applicability

The OTA sensitivity requirement is based upon the declaration of one or
more *OTA sensitivity direction declarations* (OSDD), related to a IAB
*type 1-H* and IAB *type 1-O* *receiver*.

The *IAB type 1-H* and IAB *type 1-O* *receiver* may optionally be
capable of redirecting/changing the *receiver target* by means of
adjusting BS settings resulting in multiple *sensitivity RoAoA*. The
*sensitivity RoAoA* resulting from the current BS settings is the active
*sensitivity RoAoA*.

If the IAB is capable of redirecting the *receiver target* related to
the OSDD then the OSDD shall include:

\- IAB *channel bandwidth* and declared minimum EIS level applicable to
any active *sensitivity RoAoA* inside the *receiver target redirection
range* in the OSDD.

\- A declared *receiver target redirection range*, describing all the
angles of arrival that can be addressed for the OSDD through alternative
settings in the BS.

\- Five declared *sensitivity RoAoA* comprising the conformance testing
directions as detailed in TR 37. 941 \[29\].

\- The *receiver target reference direction*.

NOTE 1: Some of the declared *sensitivity RoAoA* may coincide depending
on the redirection capability.

NOTE 2: In addition to the declared *sensitivity RoAoA*, several
*sensitivity RoAoA* may be implicitly defined by the *receiver target
redirection range* without being explicitly declared in the OSDD.

If the *IAB* is not capable of redirecting the *receiver target* related
to the OSDD, then the OSDD includes only:

\- IAB *channel bandwidth* and declared minimum EIS level applicable to
the *sensitivity RoAoA* in the OSDD.

\- One declared active *sensitivity RoAoA*.

\- The receiver target reference direction.

NOTE 3: For *BS* without target redirection capability, the declared
(fixed) *sensitivity RoAoA* is always the active *sensitivity RoAoA*.

The OTA sensitivity EIS level declaration shall apply to each supported
polarization, under the assumption of *polarization match*.

### 7.2.2 Minimum requirement

The minimum requirement for *IAB-DU type 1-H* and *IAB-DU type 1-O* is
in TS 38.174 \[2\], clause 10.2.1.

The minimum requirement for *IAB-MT type 1-H* and *IAB-MT type 1-O* is
in TS 38.174 \[2\], clause 10.2.2.

### 7.2.3 Test purpose

The test purpose is to verify that the BS can meet the throughput
requirement for a specified measurement channel at the EIS level and the
range of angles of arrival declared in the OSDD.

### 7.2.4 Method of test

#### 7.2.4.1 Initial conditions 

Test environment: Normal, see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier: M; see clause 4.9.1.

Directions to be tested:

\- receiver target reference direction (D.31),

\- conformance test directions (D.33).

#### 7.2.4.2 Procedure

> 1\) Place the BS with its manufacturer declared coordinate system
> reference point in the same place as calibrated point in the test
> system, as shown in annex E.2.1.
>
> 2\) Align the manufacturer declared coordinate system orientation of
> the BS with the test system.
>
> 3\) Align the BS with the test antenna in the declared direction to be
> tested.
>
> 4\) Ensure the polarization is accounted for such that all the power
> from the test antenna is captured by the BS under test.
>
> 5\) Start the signal generator for the wanted signal to transmit:

\- The test signal as specified in clause 7.2.5.

> 6\) Set the test signal mean power so the calibrated radiated power at
> the BS Antenna Array coordinate system reference point is as specified

### 7.2.5 Test requirements

#### 7.2.5.1 General

The minimum EIS level is a declared figure (D.27, D.28) for each OSDD
(D.23). The test requirement is calculated from the declared value
offset by the EIS Test Tolerance specified in clause 4.1.

#### 7.2.5.2 Test requirements for *IAB-DU type 1-H* and *IAB-DU type 1-O*

For each measured carrier, the throughput measured in step 7 of
clause 7.2.4.2 shall be ≥ 95 % of the maximum throughput of the
reference measurement channel as specified in annex A.1 with parameters
specified in table 7.2.5.2-1.

7.3 OTA reference sensitivity level
-----------------------------------

### 7.3.1 Definition and applicability

The OTA REFSENS requirement is a directional requirement and is intended
to ensure the minimum OTA reference sensitivity level for a declared
*OTA REFSENS RoAoA*. The OTA reference sensitivity power level
EIS~REFSENS~ is the minimum mean power received at the RIB at which a
reference performance requirement shall be met for a specified reference
measurement channel.

The OTA REFSENS EIS level declaration shall apply to each supported
polarization, under the assumption of *polarization match*.

### 7.3.2 Minimum requirement

For *IAB-DU type 1-O* the minimum requirement is in TS 38.174 \[2\],
clause 10.3.2.1.

For *IAB-DU type 2-O* the minimum requirement is in TS 38.174 \[2\],
clause 10.3.3.2.

For *IAB-MT type 1-O* the minimum requirement is in TS 38.174 \[2\],
clause 10.3.3.2.

For *IAB-MT type 2-O* the minimum requirement is in TS 38.174 \[2\],
clause 10.3.3.3.

### 7.3.3 Test Purpose

The test purpose is to verify that the IAB can meet the throughput
requirement for a specified measurement channel at the EIS~REFSENS~
level and the range of angles of arrival within the *OTA REFSENS RoAoA*.

### 7.3.4 Method of test

#### 7.3.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: Normal, see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier:

\- B, M and T; see clause 4.9.1.

Directions to be tested:

\- OTA REFSENS receiver target reference direction (D.54),

\- OTA REFSENS conformance test directions (D.55).

#### 7.3.4.2 Procedure

1\) Place the IAB with its manufacturer declared coordinate system
reference point in the same place as calibrated point in the test
system, as shown in annex E.2.1.

2\) Align the manufacturer declared coordinate system orientation of the
IAB with the test system.

3\) Align the IAB with the test antenna in the declared direction to be
tested.

4\) Ensure the polarization is accounted for such that all the power
from the test antenna is captured by the IAB under test.

5\) Start the signal generator for the wanted signal to transmit:

\- The test signal as specified in clause 7.3.5.

6\) Set the test signal mean power so the calibrated radiated power at
the BS Antenna Array coordinate system reference point is as specified
in clause 7.3.5.

7\) Measure the throughput according to annex A.1 for each supported
polarization.

9\) Repeat steps 3 to 9 for all OTA REFSENS conformance test directions
of the IAB (D.55), and supported polarizations.

For multi-band capable FR1 IAB and single band tests, repeat the steps
above per involved band where single band test configurations and test
models shall apply with no carriers activated in the other band.

### 7.3.5 Test requirements

#### 7.3.5.1 General

The FR1 EIS~REFSENS~ level is the conducted REFSENS requirement value
offset by Δ~OTAREFSENS~. The test requirement is calculated from the
EIS~REFSENS~ level offset by the EIS~REFSENS~ Test Tolerance specified
in clause 4.1.

#### 7.3.5.2 IAB-DU OTA reference sensitivity level

##### 7.3.5.2.1 Test requirements for *IAB-DU type 1-O*

For each measured carrier, the throughput measured in step 7 of
clause 7.3.4.2 shall be ≥ 95 % of the maximum throughput of the
reference measurement channel as specified in annex A.1 with parameters
specified in tables 7.3.5.2.1-1 to 7.3.5.2.1-3.

##### 7.3.5.2.2 Test requirements for *IAB-DU type 2-O*

The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference
measurement channel as specified in annex A.1 when the OTA test signal
is at the corresponding EIS~REFSENS~ level and arrives from any
direction within the *OTA REFSENS RoAoA*.

EIS~REFSENS~ levels are derived from a single declared basis level
EIS~REFSENS\_50M,~ which is based on a reference measurement channel
with 50 MHz *IAB-DU channel bandwidth*. EIS~REFSENS\_50M~ itself is not
a requirement and although it is based on a reference measurement
channel with 50 MHz IAB channel bandwidth it does not imply that IAB-DU
has to support 50 MHz *IAB-DU channel bandwidth*.

For Wide Area IAB-DU, EIS~REFSENS\_50M~ is an integer value in the range
-96 to -119 dBm. The specific value is declared by the vendor.

For Medium Range IAB-DU, EIS~REFSENS\_50M~ is an integer value in the
range -91 to -114 dBm. The specific value is declared by the vendor.

For Local Area IAB-DU, EIS~REFSENS\_50M~ is an integer value in the
range -86 to -109 dBm. The specific value is declared by the vendor.

##### 7.3.5.3.2 Minimum requirement for *IAB-MT type 2-O*

The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference
measurement channel as specified in the corresponding table and annex
A.1 when the OTA test signal is at the corresponding EIS~REFSENS~ level
and arrives from any direction within the *OTA REFSENS RoAoA*.

EIS~REFSENS~ levels are derived from a single declared basis level
EIS~REFSENS\_50M,~ which is based on a reference measurement channel
with 50 MHz *IAB-MT channel bandwidth*. EIS~REFSENS\_50M~ itself is not
a requirement and although it is based on a reference measurement
channel with 50 MHz *IAB-MT channel bandwidth* it does not imply that
IAB-MT has to support 50 MHz *IAB-MT channel bandwidth*.

7.4 OTA dynamic range
---------------------

### 7.4.1 Definition and applicability

The OTA dynamic range is a measure of the capability of the receiver
unit to receive a wanted signal in the presence of an interfering signal
inside the received *IAB-DU channel bandwidth*.

The requirement shall apply at the RIB when the AoA of the incident wave
of a received signal and the interfering signal are from the same
direction and are within the *OTA REFSENS RoAoA.*

The wanted and interfering signals apply to each supported polarization,
under the assumption of *polarization match*.

### 7.4.2 Minimum requirement

For *IAB-DU type 1-O*, the minimum requirement is in TS 38.174 \[2\],
clause 10.4.1.

### 7.4.3 Test purpose

The test purpose is to verify that at the IAB-DU receiver dynamic range,
the relative throughput shall fulfil the specified limit.

### 7.4.4 Method of test

#### 7.4.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: Normal: see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier: M; see clause 4.9.1.

Directions to be tested: OTA REFSENS receiver target reference direction
(D.54).

#### 7.4.4.2 Procedure

1\) Place the IAB-DU with its manufacturer declared coordinate system
reference point in the same place as calibrated point in the test
system, as shown in annex E.2.2.

2\) Align the manufacturer declared coordinate system orientation of the
IAN-DU with the test system.

3\) Align the IAB-DU with the test antenna in the declared direction to
be tested.

4\) Ensure the polarization is accounted for such that all the power
from the test antenna is captured by the IAB-DU under test.

5\) Set the test signal mean power so that the calibrated radiated power
at the IAB-DU Antenna Array coordinate system reference point is as
follows:

a\) Set the signal generator for the wanted signal to transmit as
specified in table 7.4.5.2-1 to 7.4.5.2-3.

b\) Set the signal generator for the AWGN interfering signal at the same
frequency as the wanted signal to transmit as specified in table
7.4.5.2-1 to 7.4.5.2-3.

6\) Measure the throughput according to annex A.2 for each supported
polarization.

For *multi-band RIB(s)* and single band tests, repeat the steps above
per involved band where single band test configurations and test models
shall apply with no carriers activated in the other band.

### 7.4.5 Test requirement

#### 7.4.5.1 General

The test requirement is calculated from the OTA wanted signal mean power
level offset by the OTA dynamic range Test Tolerance specified in
clause 4.1.

#### 7.4.5.2 Test requirements for *IAB-DU type 1-O*

For each measured carrier, the throughput measured in step 6 of
clause 7.4.4.2 shall be ≥ 95 % of the maximum throughput of the
reference measurement channel as specified in annex A.2 with parameters
specified in tables 7.4.5.2-1 to 7.4.5.2-3.

7.5 OTA in-band selectivity and blocking
----------------------------------------

### 7.5.1 OTA adjacent channel selectivity

#### 7.5.1.1 Definition and applicability

OTA Adjacent channel selectivity (ACS) is a measure of the receiver\'s
ability to receive an OTA wanted signal at its assigned channel
frequency in the presence of an OTA adjacent channel signal with a
specified centre frequency offset of the interfering signal to the band
edge of a victim system. The wanted and interfering signals apply to
each supported polarization, under the assumption of polarization match.

#### 7.5.1.2 Minimum requirement

For *IAB-DU type 1-O,* the minimum requirements are in TS 38.174 \[2\],
clause 10.5.1.2.

For *IAB-DU type 2-O* , The minimum requirements are in TS 38.174 \[2\],
clause 10.5.1.3.

For *IAB-MT* *type 1-O,* The minimum requirements are in TS 38.174
\[2\], clause 10.5.1.5.

For *IAB-MT* *type 2-O,* The minimum requirements are in TS 38.174
\[2\], clause 10.5.1.4.

#### 7.5.1.3 Test purpose

The test purpose is to verify the ability of the IAB receiver filter to
suppress interfering signals in the channels adjacent to the wanted
channel.

#### 7.5.1.4 Method of test

##### 7.5.1.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: Normal, see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier:

\- M; see clause 4.9.1.

*IAB RF Bandwidth* edge position to be tested for multi-carrier and/or
CA:

\- M~RFBW~ in single-band operation, see clause 4.9.1;

\- B~RFBW~\_T\'~RFBW~ and B\'~RFBW~\_T~RFBW~ in multi-band operation,
see clause 4.9.1.

Directions to be tested:

\- For *IAB type 1-O*, receiver target reference direction (D.31),

\- For *IAB type 2-O*, OTA REFSENS receiver target reference direction
(D.54).

##### 7.5.1.4.2 Procedure

> transmit as specified in table 7.5.1.5.4-2.
>
> For *IAB-MT* *type 2-O*, set the signal generator for the interfering
> signal at the adjacent channel frequency of the wanted signal to
> transmit as specified in table 7.5.1.5.5-2.
>
> 7\) Measure throughput according to annex A.1 for each supported
> polarization, for multi-carrier and/or CA operation the throughput
> shall be measured for relevant carriers specified by the test
> configuration specified in clauses 4.7.2 and 4.8.

For *multi-band RIB(s)* and single band tests, repeat the steps above
per involved band where single band test configurations and test models
shall apply with no carriers activated in the other band.

#### 7.5.1.5 Test requirement

##### 7.5.1.5.1 General

The test requirement is calculated from the OTA wanted signal mean power
level offset by the OTA ACS Test Tolerance specified in annex C.

##### 7.5.1.5.2 Test requirements for *IAB-DU type 1-O*

The requirement shall apply at the RIB when the AoA of the incident wave
of a received signal and the interfering signal are from the same
direction, and the AoA of the incident wave of a received signal and the
interfering signal are within the *minSENS RoAoA*.

The wanted and interfering signals apply to each supported polarization,
under the assumption o*f polarization match*.

The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference
measurement channel.

For FR1, the OTA wanted and the interfering signal are specified in
table 7.5.1.5.2-1 and table 7.5.1.5.2-2 for ACS. The reference
measurement channel for the OTA wanted signal is identified in
clause 7.3.5.2 and is further specified in annex A.1. The
characteristics of the interfering signal is further specified in annex
H.

The OTA ACS requirement is applicable outside the IAB RF Bandwidth or
Radio Bandwidth. The OTA interfering signal offset is defined relative
to the IAB RF Bandwidth edges or Radio Bandwidth edges.

For RIBs supporting operation in *non-contiguous spectrum* within any
operating band, the OTA ACS requirement shall apply in addition inside
any sub-block gap, in case the sub-block gap size is at least as wide as
the NR interfering signal in table 7.5.1.5.2-2. The OTA interfering
signal offset is defined relative to the sub-block edges inside the
sub-block gap.

For *multi-band RIBs*, the OTA ACS requirement shall apply in addition
inside any Inter RF Bandwidth gap, in case the Inter RF Bandwidth gap
size is at least as wide as the NR interfering signal in table
7.5.1.5.2-2. The interfering signal offset is defined relative to the
IAB RF Bandwidth edges inside the Inter RF Bandwidth gap.

##### 7.5.1.5.3 Test requirements for *IAB-DU type 2-O*

The requirement shall apply at the RIB when the AoA of the incident wave
of a received signal and the interfering signal are from the same
direction and are within the *OTA REFSENS RoAoA.*

The wanted and interfering signals apply to each supported polarization,
under the assumption o*f polarization match*.

The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference
measurement channel.

For FR2, the OTA wanted and the interfering signal are specified in
table 7.5.1.5.3-1 and table 7.5.1.5.3-2 for ACS. The reference
measurement channel for the OTA wanted signal is identified in
clause 7.3.5.3 and is further specified in annex A.1. The
characteristics of the interfering signal is further specified in annex
H.

The OTA ACS requirement is applicable outside the IAB RF Bandwidth. The
OTA interfering signal offset is defined relative to the IAB RF
Bandwidth edges.

For RIBs supporting operation in *non-contiguous spectrum* within any
*operating band*, the OTA ACS requirement shall apply in addition inside
any sub-block gap, in case the sub-block gap size is at least as wide as
the NR interfering signal in table 7.5.1.5.3-2. The OTA interfering
signal offset is defined relative to the sub-block edges inside the
sub-block gap.

##### 7.5.1.5.4 Test requirements for *IAB-MT type 1-O*

The requirement shall apply at the RIB when the AoA of the incident wave
of a received signal and the interfering signal are from the same
direction and are within the *minSENS RoAoA*.

The wanted and interfering signals apply to each supported polarization,
under the assumption o*f polarization match*.

The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference
measurement channel.

For FR1, the OTA wanted and the interfering signal are specified in
table 7.5.1.5.4-1, table 7.5.1.5.4-2 for OTA ACS. The reference
measurement channel for the OTA wanted signal is further specified in
annex A.1. The characteristics of the interfering signal is further
specified in annex H.

The OTA ACS requirement is applicable outside the *IAB-MT RF Bandwidth*
or *Radio Bandwidth*. The OTA interfering signal offset is defined
relative to the *IAB-MT RF Bandwidth edges* or *Radio Bandwidth edges*.

For RIBs supporting operation in *non-contiguous spectrum* within any
*operating band*, the OTA ACS requirement shall apply in addition inside
any *sub-block gap*, in case the *sub-block gap* size is at least as
wide as the NR interfering signal in table 7.5.1.5.4-2. The OTA
interfering signal offset is defined relative to the *sub-block* edges
inside the *sub-block gap*.

For *multi-band RIBs*, the OTA ACS requirement shall apply in addition
inside any *Inter RF Bandwidth gap*, in case the *Inter RF Bandwidth
gap* size is at least as wide as the NR interfering signal in table
7.5.1.5.4-2. The interfering signal offset is defined relative to the
*IAB-MT RF Bandwidth* edges inside the *Inter RF Bandwidth gap*.

##### 7.5.1.5.5 Test requirements for *IAB-MT type 2-O*

The requirement shall apply at the RIB when the AoA of the incident wave
of a received signal and the interfering signal are from the same
direction and are within the *OTA REFSENS RoAoA.*

The wanted and interfering signals apply to all supported polarizations,
under the assumption o*f polarization match*.

The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference
measurement channel.

For FR2, the OTA wanted and the interfering signal are specified in
table 7.5.1.5.5-1 and table 7.5.1.5.5-2 for ACS. The reference
measurement channel for the OTA wanted signal is further specified in
annex A.1. The characteristics of the interfering signal is further
specified in annex H.

The OTA ACS requirement is applicable outside the *IAB-MT RF Bandwidth*.
The OTA interfering signal offset is defined relative to the *IAB-MT RF
Bandwidth edges*.

For Wide Area IAB-MT, for RIBs supporting operation in *non-contiguous
spectrum* within any *operating band*, the OTA ACS requirement shall
apply in addition inside any sub-block gap, in case the sub-block gap
size is at least as wide as the NR interfering signal in table
7.5.1.5.5-2. The OTA interfering signal offset is defined relative to
the sub-block edges inside the sub-block gap.

### 7.5.2 OTA in-band blocking

#### 7.5.2.1 Definition and applicability

The OTA in-band blocking characteristics is a measure of the receiver\'s
ability to receive a OTA wanted signal at its assigned channel in the
presence of an unwanted OTA interferer, which is an NR signal for
general blocking or an NR signal with one RB for narrowband blocking.

#### 7.5.2.2 Minimum requirement

For *IAB-DU type 1-O,* the minimum requirements are in TS 38.174 \[2\],
clause 10.5.2.2.

For *IAB-DU type 2-O* , The minimum requirements are in TS 38.174 \[2\],
clause 10.5.2.3.

For *IAB-MT* *type 1-O,* The minimum requirements are in TS 38.174
\[2\], clause 10.5.2.5.

For *IAB-MT* *type 2-O,* The minimum requirements are in TS 38.174
\[2\], clause 10.5.2.4

#### 7.5.2.5 Test requirement

##### 7.5.2.5.1 General

The test requirement is calculated from the OTA wanted signal mean power
level offset by the OTA in-band blocking Test Tolerance specified in
annex C.

##### 7.5.2.5.2 Test requirements for *IAB-DU type 1-O*

The requirement shall apply at the RIB when the AoA of the incident wave
of a received signal and the interfering signal are from the same
direction, and:

\- when the wanted signal is based on EIS~REFSENS~: the AoA of the
incident wave of a received signal and the interfering signal are within
the *OTA REFSENS RoAoA.*

\- when the wanted signal is based on EIS~minSENS~: the AoA of the
incident wave of a received signal and the interfering signal are within
the *minSENS RoAoA*.

The wanted and interfering signals apply to each supported polarization,
under the assumption of *polarization match*.

The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference
measurement channel, with OTA wanted and OTA interfering signal
specified in tables 7.5.2.5.2-1, table 7.5.2.5.2-2 and table 7.5.2.5.2-3
for general OTA and narrowband OTA blocking requirements. The reference
measurement channel for the OTA wanted signal is identified in
clause 7.3.5.2 and is further specified in annex A.1. The
characteristics of the interfering signal is further specified in annex
H.

The OTA in-band blocking requirements apply outside the *IAB RF
Bandwidth* or *Radio Bandwidth*. The interfering signal offset is
defined relative to the *IAB RF Bandwidth* *edges* or *Radio Bandwidth*
edges.

For *IAB-DU type 1-O* the OTA in-band blocking requirement shall apply
in the in-band blocking frequency range, which is defined within
frequency range from F~UL\_low~ - Δf~OOB~ to F~UL\_high~ + Δf~OOB~,
where the Δf~OOB~ for *IAB type 1-O* is defined in table 7.5.2.5.2-0.

  IAB-DU type       *Operating band* characteristics                Δf~OOB~ (MHz)
  ----------------- ----------------------------------------------- ---------------
  IAB-DU type 1-O   F~UL\_high~ -- F~UL\_low~ \< 100 MHz            20
                    100 MHz ≤ F~UL\_high~ -- F~UL\_low~ ≤ 900 MHz   60

For RIBs supporting operation in *non-contiguous spectrum* within any
*operating band*, the OTA in-band blocking requirements apply in
addition inside any sub-block gap, in case the sub-block gap size is at
least as wide as twice the interfering signal minimum offset in table
7.5.2.5.2-1. The interfering signal offset is defined relative to the
sub-block edges inside the sub-block gap.

For *multi-band RIBs*, the OTA in-band blocking requirements apply in
the in-band blocking frequency ranges for each supported *operating
band*. The requirement shall apply in addition inside any *Inter RF
Bandwidth gap*, in case the *Inter RF Bandwidth gap* size is at least as
wide as twice the interfering signal minimum offset in tables
7.5.2.5.2-1 and 7.5.2.5.2-3.

For a RIBs supporting operation in *non-contiguous spectrum* within any
operating band, the OTA narrowband blocking requirements apply in
addition inside any sub-block gap, in case the sub-block gap size is at
least as wide as the interfering signal minimum offset in table
7.5.2.5.2-3. The interfering signal offset is defined relative to the
sub-block edges inside the sub-block gap.

For a *multi-band RIBs*, the OTA narrowband blocking requirements apply
in the narrowband blocking frequency ranges for each supported
*operating band*. The requirement shall apply in addition inside any
*Inter RF Bandwidth gap*, in case the *Inter RF Bandwidth gap* size is
at least as wide as the interfering signal minimum offset in table
7.5.2.5.2-3.

##### 7.5.2.5.3 Test requirements for *IAB-DU type 2-O*

The requirement shall apply at the RIB when the AoA of the incident wave
of a received signal and the interfering signal are from the same
direction and are within the *OTA REFSENS RoAoA.*

The wanted and interfering signals apply to each supported polarization,
under the assumption o*f polarization match*.

The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference
measurement channel.

For *IAB-DU type 2-O*, the OTA wanted and OTA interfering signals are
provided at RIB using the parameters in table 7.5.2.5.3-1 for general
OTA blocking requirements. The reference measurement channel for the OTA
wanted signal is identified in clause 7.3.5.3 and is further specified
in annex A.1. The characteristics of the interfering signal is further
specified in annex H.

The OTA blocking requirements are applicable outside the *IAB RF
Bandwidth*. The interfering signal offset is defined relative to the
*IAB RF Bandwidth edges*.

For *IAB-DU type 2-O* the OTA blocking requirement shall apply in the
in-band blocking frequency range, which is defined within frequency
range from F~UL\_low~ - Δf~OOB~ to F~UL\_high~ + Δf~OOB~,where the
Δf~OOB~ for *IAB-DU type 2-O* is defined in table 7.5.2.5.3-0.

  ----------------- -------------------------------------- ---------------
  IAB-DU type 2-O   F~UL\_high~ -- F~UL\_low~ ≤ 4000 MHz   1500

For a RIBs supporting operation in *non-contiguous spectrum* within any
*operating band*, the OTA blocking requirements apply in addition inside
any sub-block gap, in case the sub-block gap size is at least as wide as
twice the interfering signal minimum offset in table 7.5.2.5.3-1. The
interfering signal offset is defined relative to the sub-block edges
inside the sub-block gap.

##### 7.5.2.5.4 Test requirements for *IAB-MT type 1-O*

The requirement shall apply at the RIB when the AoA of the incident wave
of a received signal and the interfering signal are from the same
direction, and:

\- when the wanted signal is based on EIS~REFSENS~: the AoA of the
incident wave of a received signal and the interfering signal are within
the *OTA REFSENS RoAoA.*

\- when the wanted signal is based on EIS~minSENS~: the AoA of the
incident wave of a received signal and the interfering signal are within
the *minSENS RoAoA*.

The wanted and interfering signals apply to each supported polarization,
under the assumption of *polarization match*.

The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference
measurement channel, with OTA wanted and OTA interfering signal
specified in tables 10.5.2.5-1, table 10.5.2.5-2 and table 10.5.2.5-3
for general OTA and narrowband OTA blocking requirements. The reference
measurement channel for the OTA wanted signal is identified in clause
10.3.3 and are further specified in annex A.1. The characteristics of
the interfering signal is further specified in annex H.

The OTA in-band blocking requirements apply outside the *IAB-MT RF
Bandwidth* or *Radio Bandwidth*. The interfering signal offset is
defined relative to the *IAB-MT RF Bandwidth edges* or *Radio Bandwidth*
edges.

For *IAB-MT type 1-O* the OTA in-band blocking requirement shall apply
in the in-band blocking frequency range, which is from F~DL,low~ -
Δf~OOB~ to F~DL,high~ + Δf~OOB~.*.* The Δf~OOB~ for *wide area IAB-MT
type 1-O* is defined in table 10.5.2.5-0.

  IAB-MT type       *Operating band* characteristics              Δf~OOB~ (MHz)
  ----------------- --------------------------------------------- ---------------
  IAB-MT type 1-O   F~DL,high~ -- F~DL,low~ \< 100 MHz            20
                    100 MHz ≤ F~DL,high~ -- F~DL,low~ ≤ 900 MHz   60

For RIBs supporting operation in *non-contiguous spectrum* within any
*operating band*, the OTA in-band blocking requirements apply in
addition inside any *sub-block gap*, in case the *sub-block gap* size is
at least as wide as twice the interfering signal minimum offset in table
10.5.2.2-1. The interfering signal offset is defined relative to the
*sub-block* edges inside the *sub-block gap*.

For *multi-band RIBs*, the OTA in-band blocking requirements apply in
the in-band blocking frequency ranges for each supported *operating
band*. The requirement shall apply in addition inside any *Inter RF
Bandwidth gap*, in case the *Inter RF Bandwidth gap* size is at least as
wide as twice the interfering signal minimum offset in tables 10.5.2.5-1
and 10.5.2.5-3.

For a RIBs supporting operation in *non-contiguous spectrum* within any
*operating band*, the OTA narrowband blocking requirements apply in
addition inside any *sub-block gap*, in case the *sub-block gap* size is
at least as wide as the interfering signal minimum offset in table
10.5.2.5-3. The interfering signal offset is defined relative to the
*sub-block* edges inside the *sub-block gap*.

For a *multi-band RIBs*, the OTA narrowband blocking requirements apply
in the narrowband blocking frequency ranges for each supported
*operating band*. The requirement shall apply in addition inside any
*Inter RF Bandwidth gap*, in case the *Inter RF Bandwidth gap* size is
at least as wide as the interfering signal minimum offset in table
10.5.2.5-3.

##### 7.5.2.5.5 Test requirements for *IAB-MT type 2-O*

The requirement shall apply at the RIB when the AoA of the incident wave
of a received signal and the interfering signal are from the same
direction and are within the *OTA REFSENS RoAoA.*

The wanted and interfering signals apply to each supported polarization,
under the assumption o*f polarization match*.

The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference
measurement channel.

For Wide Area *IAB-MT type 2-O*, the OTA wanted and OTA interfering
signals are provided at RIB using the parameters in table 7.5.2.5.5-1
for general OTA blocking requirements. The reference measurement channel
for the wanted signal is further specified in annex A.1. The
characteristics of the interfering signal is further specified in annex
H.

The OTA blocking requirements are applicable outside the IAB-MT RF
Bandwidth. The interfering signal offset is defined relative to the
*IAB-MT RF Bandwidth edges*.

For Wide Area *IAB-MT type 2-O* the OTA in-band blocking requirement
shall apply from F~DL\_low~ - Δf~OOB~ to F~DL\_high~ + Δf~OOB~*.* The
Δf~OOB~ for *IAB-MT type 2-O* is defined in table 7.5.2.5.5-0.

For Wide Area IAB-MT and for a RIBs supporting operation in
*non-contiguous spectrum* within any *operating band*, the OTA blocking
requirements apply in addition inside any sub-block gap, in case the
sub-block gap size is at least as wide as twice the interfering signal
minimum offset in table 7.5.2.5.5-1. The interfering signal offset is
defined relative to the sub-block edges inside the sub-block gap.

7.6 OTA out-of-band blocking 
----------------------------

### 7.6.1 Definition and applicability

The OTA out-of-band blocking characteristics are a measure of the
receiver unit ability to receive a wanted signal at the *RIB* at its
assigned channel in the presence of an unwanted interferer.

For the general OTA out-of-band blocking the requirement applies to the
wanted signal for each supported polarization, under the assumption of
*polarization match.* The interferer shall be polarization matched for
in-band frequencies and the polarization maintained for out-of-band
frequencies.

### 7.6.2 Minimum requirement

For *IAB* *type 1-O,* the minimum requirements are defined in
TS 38.174 \[2\], clause 10.6.2. Co-location minimum requirements are
defined in TS 38.174\[2\], clause 10.6.4.

For *IAB* *type 2-O*, the minimum requirements are defined in
TS 38.174 \[2\], clause 10.6.3.

### 7.6.3 Test purpose

The test stresses the ability of the receiver unit associated with the
*RIB* under test to withstand high-level interference from unwanted
signals at specified frequency bands, without undue degradation of its
sensitivity.

### 7.6.4 Method of test

#### 7.6.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: Normal; see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier (SC): M; see clause 4.9.1.

*IAB RF Bandwidth* positions to be tested for multi-carrier (MC):

\- M~RFBW~ in *single-band RIB*, see clause 4.9.1; B~RFBW~\_T\'~RFBW~
and B\'~RFBW~\_T~RFBW~ in *multi-band RIB*, see clause 4.9.1.

In addition, for *multi-band RIB*:

\- For B~RFBW~\_T\'~RFBW~, blocking testing above the highest operating
band may be omitted.

\- For B\'~RFBW~\_T~RFBW~, blocking testing below the lowest operating
band may be omitted.

Directions to be tested:

\- For *IAB type 1-O*, receiver target reference direction (D.31).

\- For *IAB type 2-O*, OTA REFSENS receiver target reference direction
(D.54).

### 7.6.5 Test requirements

#### 7.6.5.1 Requirement for *IAB Type 1-O*

The test requirement consists of general and co-location requirements.

##### 7.6.5.1.1 General

For OTA wanted and OTA interfering signals provided at the RIB using the
parameters in table 7.6.5.1.1-1, the following requirements shall be
met:

\- The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the
reference measurement channel. The reference measurement channel for the
OTA wanted signal is identified in clause 10.3.2 in TS 38.104 \[4\] for
each *IAB channel bandwidth* and further specified in annex A.1.

For a *multi-band RIB*, the OTA out-of-band requirement shall apply for
each supported *operating band*, with the exception that the in-band
blocking frequency ranges of all supported *operating bands* according
to clause 7.4.2.2 in TS 38.104 \[4\] shall be excluded from the OTA
out‑of‑band blocking requirement.

For *IAB type 1-O* the OTA out-of-band blocking requirement apply from
30 MHz to F~UL\_low~ - Δf~OOB~ and from F~UL\_high~ + Δf~OOB~ up to
12750 MHz. The Δf~OOB~ for *IAB type 1-O* is defined in table
7.5.2.5.2-0.

##### 7.6.5.1.2 Co-location requirement

This additional OTA out-of-band blocking requirement may be applied for
the protection of IAB receivers when NR, E‑UTRA BS, UTRA BS, CDMA BS ,
GSM/EDGE BS or IAB-DU and/or IAB-MT operating in a different frequency
band are co-located with an IAB-Node.

The requirement is a co-location requirement. The interferer power
levels are specified at the *co-location reference antenna* conducted
input. The interfering signal power is specified per supported
polarization.

The requirement is valid over the *minSENS RoAoA*.

For OTA wanted and OTA interfering signal provided at the RIB using the
parameters in table 7.6.5.1.2-1, the following requirements shall be
met:

\- The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the
reference measurement channel. The reference measurement channel for the
OTA wanted signal is identified in TS 38.174 \[2\] clause 10.3 for each
*IAB channel bandwidth* and further specified in annex A.1. The
characteristics of the interfering signal is further specified in annex
H.

For *IAB type 1-O* the OTA blocking requirement for co-location with BS
or IAB-Node in other frequency bands is applied for all *operating
bands* for which co-location protection is provided.

7.7 OTA receiver spurious emissions
-----------------------------------

### 7.7.1 Definition and applicability

The OTA RX spurious emission is the power of the emissions radiated from
the antenna array from a receiver unit.

Unless otherwise stated, all requirements are measured as mean power.

The OTA receiver spurious emission limits for FR1 shall apply from
30 MHz to 12.75 GHz, excluding the frequency range from Δf~OBUE~ below
the lowest frequency of each supported downlink *operating band*, up to
Δf~OBUE~ above the highest frequency of each supported downlink
*operating band*, where the Δf~OBUE~ is defined in clause \[6.7.1\]. For
some *operating bands*, the upper limit of the spurious range might be
higher than 12.75 GHz in order to comply with the 5^th^ harmonic limit
of the uplink *operating band*, as specified in Recommendation ITU-R
SM.329 \[10\].

For *multi-band RIB* the above exclusion applies for each supported
*operating band*.

The OTA receiver spurious emission limits for FR2 shall apply from
30 MHz to 2^nd^ harmonic of the upper frequency edge of the uplink
*operating band*, excluding the frequency range from Δf~OBUE~ below the
lowest frequency of each supported downlink *operating band*, up to
Δf~OBUE~ above the highest frequency of each supported downlink
*operating band*, where the Δf~OBUE~ is defined in clause \[6.7.1\].

For a IAB operating in TDD, the OTA RX spurious emissions requirement
shall apply during the *transmitter OFF period* only.

The metric used to capture OTA receiver spurious emissions for *IAB type
1-O* and *IAB type 2-O* is total radiated power (TRP), with the
requirement defined at the RIB.

### 7.7.2 Minimum requirement

The minimum requirement for *IAB-DU type 1-O* is specified in TS 38.174
\[2\], clause 10.7.1.2.

The minimum requirement for *IAB-DU type 2-O* is specified in TS 38.174
\[2\], clause 10.7.2.2.

The minimum requirement for *IAB-MT type 1-O* is specified in TS 38.174
\[2\], clause 10.7.3.1.

The minimum requirement for *IAB-MT type 2-O* is specified in TS 38.174
\[2\], clause 10.7.3.2.

### 7.7.3 Test purpose

The test purpose is to verify if the receiver radiated spurious
emissions from the IAB at the RIB are within the specified minimum
requirements.

### 7.7.4 Method of test

Directions to be tested: As the requirement is TRP the beam pattern(s)
may be set up to optimise the TRP measurement procedure (see annex I) as
long as the required TRP level is achieved.

#### 7.7.4.2 Procedure

The following procedure for measuring TRP is based on the directional
power measurements as described in annex I. An alternative method to
measure TRP is to use a characterized and calibrated reverberation
chamber if so follow steps 1, 3, 4, 5, 7 and 10.

> 1\) Place the IAB at the positioner.
>
> 2\) Align the manufacturer declared coordinate system orientation
> (D.2) of the IAB with the test system.
>
> 3\) Measurements shall use a measurement bandwidth in accordance to
> the conditions in clause 7.7.5.
>
> 4\) The measurement device characteristics shall be:
>
> \- Detection mode: True RMS.
>
> 5\) Set the TDD IAB to receive only.
>
> 6\) Orient the positioner (and IAB) in order that the direction to be
> tested aligns with the test antenna such that measurements to
> determine TRP can be performed (see annex I).
>
> 7\) Measure the emission at the specified frequencies with specified
> measurement bandwidth
>
> 8\) Repeat step 6-9 for all directions in the appropriated TRP
> measurement grid needed for full TRP estimation (see annex I).

NOTE 1: The TRP measurement grid may not be the same for all measurement
frequencies.

NOTE 2: The frequency sweep or the TRP measurement grid sweep may be
done in any order

> 9\) Calculate TRP at each specified frequency using the directional
> measurements.

In addition, for *multi-band RIB(s)*, the following steps shall apply:

> 10\) For *IAB type 1-O* and *multi-band RIB(s)* and single band tests,
> repeat the steps above per involved band where single band test
> configurations and test models shall apply with no carrier activated
> in the other band.

### 7.7.5 Test requirement

#### 7.7.5.1 Test requirement for *IAB type 1-O*

For RX only *multi-band RIB*, the OTA receiver spurious emissions
requirements are subject to exclusion zones in each supported *operating
band*.

The power of any spurious emission shall not exceed the levels in table
7.7.5.1-1:

7.8 OTA receiver intermodulation
--------------------------------

### 7.8.1 Definition and applicability

Third and higher order mixing of the two interfering RF signals can
produce an interfering signal in the band of the desired channel.
Intermodulation response rejection is a measure of the capability of the
receiver unit to receive a wanted signal on its assigned channel
frequency in the presence of two interfering signals which have a
specific frequency relationship to the wanted signal. The requirement is
defined as a directional requirement at the *RIB*.

The wanted and interfering signals apply to each supported polarization,
under the assumption of *polarization match*.

### 7.8.2 Minimum requirement

The minimum requirements for *IAB-DU type 1-O* are in TS 38.174 \[2\],
clause 10.8.2.

The minimum requirements for *IAB-DU type 2-O* are in TS 38.174 \[2\],
clause 10.8.3.

The minimum requirements for *IAB-MT type 1-O* are in TS 38.174 \[2\],
clause 10.8.4.

### 7.8.3 Test purpose

The test purpose is to verify the ability of the IAB receiver to inhibit
the generation of intermodulation products in its non-linear elements
caused by the presence of two high-level interfering signals at
frequencies with a specific relationship to the frequency of the wanted
signal.

### 7.8.4 Method of test

#### 7.8.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: Normal, annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier: M; see clause 4.9.1.

*IAB RF Bandwidth* positions to be tested for multi-carrier and/or CA:

\- M~RFBW~ for *single-band operation*, see clause 4.9.1.

\- B~RFBW~\_T\'~RFBW~ and B\'~RFBW~\_T~RFBW~ for multi-band operation,
see clause 4.9.1.

Directions to be tested:

\- OTA REFSENS receiver target reference direction (D.54).

\- In addition, for *IAB type 1-O*, receiver target reference direction
(D.31).

#### 7.8.4.2 Procedure

> 1\) Place the IAB with its manufacturer declared coordinate system
> reference point in the same place as calibrated point in the test
> system, as shown in annex E.2.6.
>
> 2\) Align the manufacturer declared coordinate system orientation of
> the IAB with the test system.
>
> 3\) Align the IAB with the test antenna in the declared direction to
> be tested.
>
> 4\) Align the IAB to that the wanted signal and interferer signal is
> *polarization matched* with the test antenna(s).
>
> 5\) Configure the beam peak direction of the IAB according to declared
> reference beam direction pair for the appropriate beam identifier.
>
> 6\) Set the test signal mean power so the calibrated radiated power at
> the IAB Antenna Array coordinate system reference point is as
> specified as follows:
>
> a\) Set the signal generator for the wanted signal to transmit as
> specified in sub-clause 7.8.5.1 for *IAB-DU type 1-O*, sub-clause
> 7.8.5.2 for *IAB-DU type 2-O* and sub-clause 7.8.5.3 for *IAB-MT type
> 1-O*.
>
> b\) Set the signal generator for the interfering signal at the same
> frequency as the wanted signal to transmit as specified in sub-clause
> 7.8.5.1 for *IAB-DU type 1-O*, sub-clause 7.8.5.2 for *IAB-DU type
> 2-O* and sub-clause 7.8.5.3 for *IAB-MT type 1-O*.
>
> 7\) Set the signal generator for the interfering signal to transmit at
> the frequency offset and as specified in sub-clause 7.8.5.1 for
> *IAB-DU type 1-O*, sub-clause 7.8.5.2 for *IAB-DU type 2-O* and
> sub-clause 7.8.5.3 for *IAB-MT type 1-O*.
>
> 8\) Measure the throughput according to annex A.1 for each supported
> polarization, for multi-carrier and/or CA operation the throughput
> shall be measured for relevant carriers specified by the test
> configuration specified in clause 4.7.
>
> 9\) Repeat for all the specified measurement directions and supported
> polarizations.

In addition, for *multi-band RIB(s)*, the following steps shall apply:

> 10\) For *multi-band RIBs* and single band tests, repeat the steps
> above per involved band where single band test configurations and test
> models shall apply with no carrier activated in the other band.

### 7.8.5 Test requirement

#### 7.8.5.1 IAB-DU type 1-O

The requirement shall apply at the RIB when the AoA of the incident wave
of a received signal and the interfering signal are from the same
direction, and:

\- when the wanted signal is based on EIS~REFSENS~: the AoA of the
incident wave of a received signal and the interfering signal are within
the *FR1 OTA REFSENS RoAoA.*

\- when the wanted signal is based on EIS~minSENS~: the AoA of the
incident wave of a received signal and the interfering signal are within
the *minSENS RoAoA*.

The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference
measurement channel, with a wanted signal at the assigned channel
frequency and two interfering signals at the RIB with the conditions
specified in tables 7.8.5.1-1 and 7.8.5.1-2 for intermodulation
performance and in tables 7.8.5.1-3 and 7.8.5.1-4 for narrowband
intermodulation performance.

The reference measurement channel for the wanted signal is identified in
table 7.3.5.2-1, table 7.3.5.2-2 and table 7.3.5.2-3 for each *IAB-DU
channel bandwidth* and further specified in annex A.1.

The subcarrier spacing for the modulated interfering signal shall be the
same as the subcarrier spacing for the wanted signal, except for the
case of wanted signal subcarrier spacing 60 kHz and *IAB-DU channel
bandwidth* ≤ 20 MHz, for which the subcarrier spacing of the interfering
signal should be 30 kHz.

The receiver intermodulation requirement is applicable outside the
IAB-DU RF Bandwidth or Radio Bandwidth edges. The interfering signal
offset is defined relative to the IAB-DU RF Bandwidth edges or Radio
Bandwidth edges.

For a RIBs supporting operation in non-contiguous spectrum within any
*operating band*, the narrowband intermodulation requirement shall apply
in addition inside any sub-block gap in case the sub-block gap is at
least as wide as the *IAB-DU channel bandwidth* of the NR interfering
signal in tables 7.8.5.1-2 and 7.8.5.1-4. The interfering signal offset
is defined relative to the sub-block edges inside the sub-block gap.

For *multi-band RIBs*, the intermodulation requirement shall apply in
addition inside any Inter RF Bandwidth gap, in case the gap size is at
least twice as wide as the NR interfering signal centre frequency offset
from the IAB-DU RF Bandwidth edge.

For *multi-band RIBs*, the narrowband intermodulation requirement shall
apply in addition inside any Inter RF Bandwidth gap in case the gap size
is at least as wide as the NR interfering signal in tables 7.8.5.1-2 and
7.8.5.1-4. The interfering signal offset is defined relative to the
IAB-DU RF Bandwidth edges inside the Inter RF Bandwidth gap.

#### 7.8.5.2 IAB-DU type 2-O

Throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference
measurement channel, with OTA wanted signal at the assigned channel
frequency and two OTA interfering signals provided at the RIB using the
parameters in tables 7.8.5.2-1 and 7.8.5.2-2. All of the OTA test
signals arrive from the same direction, and the requirement is valid if
the signals arrive from any direction within the *FR2 OTA REFSENS
RoAoA*. The reference measurement channel for the wanted signal is
identified in table 7.3.5.3-1 for each *IAB-DU channel bandwidth* and
further specified in annex A.1.

The subcarrier spacing for the modulated interfering signal shall be the
same as the subcarrier spacing for the wanted signal.

The receiver intermodulation requirement is applicable outside the
IAB-DU RF Bandwidth. The interfering signal offset is defined relative
to the IAB-DU RF Bandwidth edges.

#### 7.8.5.3 IAB-MT type 1-O

The requirement shall apply at the RIB when the AoA of the incident wave
of a received signal and the interfering signal are from the same
direction, and:

\- when the wanted signal is based on EIS~REFSENS~: the AoA of the
incident wave of a received signal and the interfering signal are within
the *FR1 OTA REFSENS RoAoA.*

\- when the wanted signal is based on EIS~minSENS~: the AoA of the
incident wave of a received signal and the interfering signal are within
the *minSENS RoAoA*.

The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference
measurement channel, with a wanted signal at the assigned channel
frequency and two interfering signals at the RIB with the conditions
specified in tables 7.8.5.3-1 and 7.8.5.3-2 for intermodulation
performance and in tables 7.8.5.3-3 and 7.8.5.3-4 for narrowband
intermodulation performance.

The reference measurement channel for the wanted signal is identified in
table 7.3.5.2-1, table 7.3.5.2-2 and table 7.3.5.2-3 for each *IAB-MT
channel bandwidth* and further specified in annex A.1.

The subcarrier spacing for the modulated interfering signal shall be the
same as the subcarrier spacing for the wanted signal, except for the
case of wanted signal subcarrier spacing 60 kHz and *IAB-MT channel
bandwidth* ≤ 20 MHz, for which the subcarrier spacing of the interfering
signal should be 30 kHz.

The receiver intermodulation requirement is applicable outside the
IAB-MT RF Bandwidth or Radio Bandwidth edges. The interfering signal
offset is defined relative to the IAB-MT RF Bandwidth edges or Radio
Bandwidth edges.

For a RIBs supporting operation in non-contiguous spectrum within any
*operating band*, the narrowband intermodulation requirement shall apply
in addition inside any sub-block gap in case the sub-block gap is at
least as wide as the *IAB-MT channel bandwidth* of the NR interfering
signal in tables 7.8.5.3-1 and 7.8.5.3-2. The interfering signal offset
is defined relative to the sub-block edges inside the sub-block gap.

For *multi-band RIBs*, the intermodulation requirement shall apply in
addition inside any Inter RF Bandwidth gap, in case the gap size is at
least twice as wide as the NR interfering signal centre frequency offset
from the IAB-MT RF Bandwidth edge.

For *multi-band RIBs*, the narrowband intermodulation requirement shall
apply in addition inside any Inter RF Bandwidth gap in case the gap size
is at least as wide as the NR interfering signal in tables 7.8.5.3-3 and
7.8.5.3-4. The interfering signal offset is defined relative to the
IAB-MT RF Bandwidth edges inside the Inter RF Bandwidth gap.

7.9 OTA in-channel selectivity
------------------------------

### 7.9.1 Definition and applicability

In-channel selectivity (ICS) is a measure of the receiver ability to
receive a wanted signal at its assigned resource block locations in the
presence of an interfering signal received at a larger power spectral
density. In this condition a throughput requirement shall be met for a
specified reference measurement channel. The interfering signal shall be
an NR signal as specified in annex E in TS 38.176-1 \[3\] and shall be
time aligned with the wanted signal.

### 7.9.2 Minimum requirement

The minimum requirement for *IAB-DU type 1-O* is in TS 38.174 \[2\],
clause 10.9.2.

The minimum requirement for *IAB-DU type 2-O* is in TS 38.174 \[2\],
clause 10.9.3.

### 7.9.3 Test purpose

The purpose of this test is to verify the IAB receiver ability to
suppress the IQ leakage.

### 7.9.4 Method of test

#### 7.9.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: Normal, see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier: M; see clause 4.9.1.

Directions to be tested:

\- For *IAB type 1-O*, receiver target reference direction (D.31),

\- For *IAB type 2-O*, OTA REFSENS receiver target reference direction
(D.54).

#### 7.9.4.2 Procedure

> 1\) Place the IAB-DU with its manufacturer declared coordinate system
> reference point in the same place as calibrated point in the test
> system, as shown in annex E.2.7.
>
> 2\) Align the manufacturer declared coordinate system orientation of
> the IAB node with the test system.
>
> 3\) Align the IAB-DU with the test antenna in the declared direction
> to be tested.
>
> 4\) Align the IAB-DU to that the wanted signal and interferer signal
> is *polarization matched* with the test antenna(s).
>
> 5\) Configure the beam peak direction for the transmitter according to
> the declared reference beam direction pair for the appropriate beam
> identifier.
>
> 6\) Set the test signal mean power so the calibrated radiated power at
> the IAB Antenna Array coordinate system reference point is as
> specified as follows:
>
> a\) Adjust the signal generator for the wanted signal as specified in
> subclause 7.9.5.1 for *IAB-DU type 1-O* and subclause 7.9.5.2 for
> *IAB-DU type 2-O*;
>
> b\) Adjust the signal generator for the interfering signal as
> specified in subclause 7.9.5.1 for *IAB-DU type 1-O* and subclause
> 7.9.5.2 for *IAB-DU type 2-O*;
>
> 7\) Measure throughput according to annex A.1 for each supported
> polarization.
>
> 8\) Repeat the measurement with the wanted signal on the other side of
> the F~C~, and the interfering signal at opposite side of the F~C~ and
> adjacent to the wanted signal.
>
> 9\) Repeat for all the specified measurement directions and supported
> polarizations.

In addition, for *multi-band RIB(s)*, the following steps shall apply:

> 10\) For *multi-band RIBs* and single band tests, repeat the steps
> above per involved band where single band test configurations and test
> models shall apply with no carrier activated in the other band.

### 7.9.5 Test requirement

#### 7.9.5.1 *IAB-DU type 1-O*

The requirement shall apply at the RIB when the AoA of the incident wave
of the received signal and the interfering signal are the same direction
and are within the *minSENS RoAoA*

The wanted and interfering signals applies to each supported
polarization, under the assumption of *polarization match.*

For a wanted and an interfering signal coupled to the RIB, the following
requirements shall be met:

\- For *IAB-DU 1-O*, the throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum
throughput of the reference measurement channel as specified in annex
A.1 with parameters specified in table 7.9.5.1-1 for Wide Area IAB-DU,
in table 7.9.5.1-2 for Medium Range IAB-DU and in table 7.9.5.1-3 for
Local Area IAB-DU.

8 Radiated performance requirements
===================================

 8.1 IAB-DU performance requirements
-----------------------------------

### 8.1.1 General

#### 8.1.1.1 Scope and definitions

Radiated performance requirements specify the ability of the *IAB type
1-O* or *IAB type 2-O* to correctly demodulate radiated signals in
various conditions and configurations. Radiated performance requirements
are specified at the RIB.

Radiated performance requirements for the BS are specified for the fixed
reference channels and propagation conditions defined in TS 38.174 \[2\]
annex A and annex G, respectively. The requirements only apply to those
FRCs that are supported by the IAB-DU.

The radiated performance requirements for *IAB type 1-O* and for the
*IAB type 2-O* are limited to two OTA *demodulations branches* as
described in clause 8.1.1.2. Conformance requirements can only be tested
for 1 or 2 *demodulation branches* depending on the number of
polarizations supported by the IAB-DU, with the required SNR applied
separately per polarization.

NOTE: IAB-DU can support more than 2 *demodulation branches*, however
OTA conformance testing can only be performed for 1 or 2 *demodulation
branches*.

Unless stated otherwise, radiated performance requirements apply for a
single carrier only. Radiated performance requirements for a IAB-DU
supporting CA are defined in terms of single carrier requirements.

The method of synchronization with the TE is left to implementation.
Neither the use of downlink signal configuration nor the use of
proprietary means is precluded. In tests performed with signal
generators a synchronization signal may be provided between the IAB-DU
and the signal generator, or a common (e.g., GNSS) source may be
provided to both IAB node and the signal generator, to enable correct
timing of the wanted signal.

The SNR used in this clause is specified based on a single carrier and
defined as:

> SNR = S / N

Where:

> S is the total signal energy in a slot on a RIB.
>
> N is the noise energy in a bandwidth corresponding to the transmission
> bandwidth over the duration of a slot.

#### 8.1.1.2 OTA demodulation branches

Radiated performance requirements are only specified for up to 2
*demodulation branches*.

If the *IAB type 1-O*, or the *IAB type 2-O* uses polarization diversity
and has the ability to maintain isolation between the signals for each
of the *demodulation branches*, then radiated performance requirements
can be tested for up to two *demodulation branches* (i.e. 1RX or 2RX
test setups). When tested for two *demodulation branches*, each
demodulation branch maps to one polarization.

If the *IAB type 1-O*, or the *IAB type 2-O* does not use polarization
diversity then radiated performance requirements can only be tested for
a single *demodulation branch* (i.e. 1RX test setup).

#### 8.1.1.3 Applicability rule

##### 8.1.1.3.1 General

Unless otherwise stated, for a IAB-DU declared to support more than 2
demodulation branches (for *IAB type 1-O* and *IAB type 2-O*), the
performance requirement tests for 2 demodulation branches shall apply,
and the mapping between connectors and demodulation branches is up to BS
implementation.

The tests requiring more than \[20\] dB SNR level are set to N/A in the
test requirements.

##### 8.1.1.3.2 Applicability of PUSCH performance requirements

##### 8.1.1.3.2.1 Applicability of requirements for different subcarrier spacings {#applicability-of-requirements-for-different-subcarrier-spacings .H6}

Unless otherwise stated, PUSCH requirement tests shall apply only for
each subcarrier spacing declared to be supported (see D.7 in table
4.6-1).

Unless otherwise stated, if IAB-DU supports more than one SCS then PUSCH
requirement tests with highest modulation order (see D.109 in table
4.6-1) shall apply only with lowest supported SCS and PUSCH requirement
tests with other modulation orders (see D.109 in table 4.6-1) shall
apply only with highest supported SCS. Otherwise, all modulation orders
are tested on supported SCS.

##### 8.1.1.3.2.2 Applicability of requirements for different channel bandwidths {#applicability-of-requirements-for-different-channel-bandwidths .H6}

For each subcarrier spacing declared to be supported, the test
requirements for a specific channel bandwidth shall apply only if the
IAB-DU supports it (see D.7 in table 4.6-1).

Unless otherwise stated, for each subcarrier spacing declared to be
supported, the tests shall be done only for the widest supported channel
bandwidth. If performance requirement is not specified for this widest
supported channel bandwidth, the tests shall be done by using
performance requirement for the closest channel bandwidth lower than
this widest supported bandwidth; the tested PRBs shall then be centered
in this widest supported channel bandwidth.

##### 8.1.1.3.2.3 Applicability of requirements for different configurations {#applicability-of-requirements-for-different-configurations .H6}

Unless otherwise stated, for *IAB type 1-O*, PUSCH requirement tests
shall apply only for the mapping type declared to be supported (see
D.100 in table 4.6-1). If both mapping type A and type B are declared to
be supported, the tests shall be done for either type A or type B; the
same chosen mapping type shall then be used for all tests.

Unless otherwise stated, for *IAB type 2-O*, PUSCH requirement tests
shall apply only for the additional DM-RS position declared to be
supported (see D.101 in table 4.6-1). If both options (i.e., pos0 and
pos1) are declared to be supported, the tests shall be done for pos1.

Unless otherwise stated, for *IAB type 2-O*, PUSCH requirement tests
with transform precoding disabled shall apply for the PT-RS option
declared to be supported (see D.106 in table 4.6-1). If both PT-RS
options (without and with PT-RS) are declared to be supported, the tests
shall be done for either without or with PT-RS only; the same chosen
option shall then be used for all tests.

Unless otherwise stated, for *IAB type 2-O*, PUSCH requirement tests
with transform precoding enabled shall be done for without PT-RS.

##### 8.1.1.3.2.4 Applicability of requirements for uplink carrier aggregation {#applicability-of-requirements-for-uplink-carrier-aggregation .H6}

The tests for uplink carrier aggregation shall be carried out according
to the declaration (see D.108 in table 4.6-1).

Unless otherwise stated, the tests for uplink carrier aggregation shall
apply only for PUSCH with transform precoding disabled, and shall be
conducted on per component carrier basis.

##### 8.1.1.3.2.5 Applicability of requirements for TDD with different UL-DL patterns {#applicability-of-requirements-for-tdd-with-different-ul-dl-patterns .H6}

Unless otherwise stated, for each subcarrier spacing declared to be
supported, if IAB-DU supports multiple TDD UL-DL patterns, only one of
the supported TDD UL-DL patterns shall be used for all tests.

##### 8.1.1.3.2.6 Applicability of requirements for transform precoding {#applicability-of-requirements-for-transform-precoding .H6}

Unless otherwise stated, the tests with transform precoding enabled
shall apply only, if the IAB-DU supports it (see D.110 in table 4.6-1).

##### 8.1.1.3.3 Applicability of PUCCH performance requirements

##### 8.1.1.3.3.1 Applicability of requirements for different formats {#applicability-of-requirements-for-different-formats .H6}

Unless otherwise stated, PUCCH requirement tests shall apply only for
each PUCCH format declared to be supported (see D.102 in table 4.6-1).

##### 8.1.1.3.3.2 Applicability of requirements for different subcarrier spacings {#applicability-of-requirements-for-different-subcarrier-spacings-1 .H6}

Unless otherwise stated, PUCCH requirement tests shall apply only for
each subcarrier spacing declared to be supported (see D.7 in table
4.6-1). If multiple subcarrier spacings are declared to be supported,
each supported PUCCH format can be tested on one subcarrier spacing.

##### 8.1.1.3.3.3 Applicability of requirements for different channel bandwidths {#applicability-of-requirements-for-different-channel-bandwidths-1 .H6}

For each subcarrier spacing declared to be supported by the IAB-DU, the
test requirements for a specific channel bandwidth shall apply only if
the IAB-DU supports it (see D.7 in table 4.6-1).

Unless otherwise stated, for each subcarrier spacing declared to be
supported, the tests shall be done only for the widest supported channel
bandwidth. If performance requirement is not specified for this widest
supported channel bandwidth, the tests shall be done by using
performance requirement for the closest channel bandwidth lower than
this widest supported bandwidth; the tested PRBs shall then be centered
in this widest supported channel bandwidth.

##### 8.1.1.3.3.4 Applicability of requirements for different configurations {#applicability-of-requirements-for-different-configurations-1 .H6}

Unless otherwise stated, PUCCH format 3 requirement tests shall apply
only for the additional DM-RS configuration declared to be supported
(see D.104 in table 4.6-1). If both options (without and with additional
DM-RS) are declared to be supported, the tests shall be done for either
without or with additional DM-RS; the same chosen option shall then be
used for all tests.

Unless otherwise stated, PUCCH format 4 requirement tests shall apply
only for the additional DM-RS configuration declared to be supported
(see D.105 in table 4.6-1). If both options (without and with additional
DM-RS) are declared to be supported, the tests shall be done for either
without or with additional DM-RS; the same chosen option shall then be
used for all tests.

##### 8.1.1.3.3.5 Applicability of requirements for multi-slot PUCCH {#applicability-of-requirements-for-multi-slot-pucch .H6}

Unless otherwise stated, multi-slot PUCCH requirement tests shall apply
only if the IAB-DU supports it (see D.107 in table 4.6-1).

##### 8.1.1.3.4 Applicability of PRACH performance requirements

##### 8.1.1.3.4.1 Applicability of requirements for different formats {#applicability-of-requirements-for-different-formats-1 .H6}

Unless otherwise stated, PRACH requirement tests shall apply only for
PRACH formats declared to be supported (see D.103 in table 4.6-1).

For IAB-DU declares to support more than one PRACH formats, limit the
number of tests to any two cases chosen by the manufacturer. If IAB-DU
declares to support more than one PRACH formats where formats for both
long and short PRACH sequences are presented, require choosing formats
with different sequences (see D.103 in table 4.6-1).

##### 8.1.1.3.4.2 Applicability of requirements for different subcarrier spacings {#applicability-of-requirements-for-different-subcarrier-spacings-2 .H6}

Unless otherwise stated, for each PRACH format with short sequence
declared to be supported, for each FR, the tests shall apply only for
the smallest supported subcarrier spacing in the FR (see D.103 in table
4.6-1).

##### 8.1.1.3.4.3 Applicability of requirements for different channel bandwidths {#applicability-of-requirements-for-different-channel-bandwidths-2 .H6}

Unless otherwise stated, for the subcarrier spacing to be tested, the
test requirements shall apply only for anyone channel bandwidth declared
to be supported (see D.7 in table 4.6-1).

### 8.1.2 Performance requirements for PUSCH

#### 8.1.2.1 Performance requirements for PUSCH with transform precoding disabled

##### 8.1.2.1.1 Definition and applicability

The performance requirement of PUSCH is determined by a minimum required
throughput for a given SNR. The required throughput is expressed as a
fraction of maximum throughput for the FRCs listed in annex A. The
performance requirements assume HARQ re-transmissions.

Which specific test(s) are applicable to IAB-DU is based on the test
applicability rules defined in clause 8.1.1.3.2.

##### 8.1.2.1.2 Minimum Requirement

For *BS type 1-O*, the minimum requirement is in TS 38.174 \[2\],
clause 11.1.2.1.1.

For *BS type 2-O*, the minimum requirement is in TS 38.174 \[2\],
clause 11.1.2.2.1

##### 8.1.2.1.3 Test purpose

The test shall verify the receiver\'s ability to achieve throughput
under multipath fading propagation conditions for a given SNR.

NOTE: If the above Test Requirement differs from the Minimum Requirement
then the Test Tolerance applied for this test is non-zero. The Test
Tolerance for this test and the explanation of how the Minimum
Requirement has been relaxed by the Test Tolerance is given in annex C.

#### 8.1.2.2 Performance requirements for PUSCH with transform precoding enabled

##### 8.1.2.2.1 Definition and applicability

The performance requirement of PUSCH is determined by a minimum required
throughput for a given SNR. The required throughput is expressed as a
fraction of maximum throughput for the FRCs listed in annex A. The
performance requirements assume HARQ re-transmissions.

Which specific test(s) are applicable to IAB-DU is based on the test
applicability rules defined in clause 8.1.1.3.2.

##### 8.1.2.2.2 Minimum Requirement

For *IAB type 1-O*, the minimum requirement is in TS 38.174 \[2\],
clause 11.1.2.1.2.

For *IAB type 2-O*, the minimum requirement is in TS 38.174 \[2\],
clause 11.1.2.2.2.

##### 8.1.2.2.3 Test Purpose

The test shall verify the receiver\'s ability to achieve throughput
under multipath fading propagation conditions for a given SNR.

##### 8.1.2.2.4 Method of test

##### 8.1.2.2.4.1 Initial Conditions {#initial-conditions-26 .H6}

Test environment: Normal, see clause B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier: M, see clause 4.9.1.

Direction to be tested: OTA REFSENS *receiver target reference
direction* (see D.54 in table 4.6-1).

##### 8.1.2.2.4.2 Procedure {#procedure-22 .H6}

> 1\) Place the IAB-DU with its manufacturer declared coordinate system
> reference point in the same place as calibrated point in the test
> system, as shown in annex E.3.
>
> 2\) Align the manufacturer declared coordinate system orientation of
> the IAB-DU with the test system.
>
> 3\) Set the IAB-DU in the declared direction to be tested.
>
> 4\) Connect the IAB-DU tester generating the wanted signal, multipath
> fading simulators and AWGN generators to a test antenna via a
> combining network in OTA test setup, as shown in annex E.3. Each of
> the demodulation branch signals should be transmitted on one
> polarization of the test antenna(s).
>
> 5\) The characteristics of the wanted signal shall be configured
> according to the corresponding UL reference measurement channel
> defined in annex A, and according to additional test parameters listed
> in table 8.1.2.2.4.2-1.

#### 8.1.2.3 Performance requirements for UCI multiplexed on PUSCH

##### 8.1.2.3.1 Definition and applicability

The performance requirement of UCI multiplexed on PUSCH is determined by
two parameters: block error probability (BLER) of CSI part 1 and block
error probability of CSI part 2. The performance is measured by the
required SNR at block error probability of CSI part 1 not exceeding 0.1
%, and the required SNR at block error probability of CSI part 2 not
exceeding 1 %.

The CSI part 1 BLER is defined as the probability of incorrectly
decoding the CSI part 1 information when the CSI part 1 information is
sent.

The CSI part 2 BLER is defined as the probability of incorrectly
decoding the CSI part 2 information when the CSI part2 information is
sent.

In the test of UCI multiplexed on PUSCH, the UCI information only
contains CSI part 1 and CSI part 2 information, there is no HACK/ACK
information transmitted.

The number of UCI information bit payload per slot is defined for two
cases as follows:

\- 7 bits: 5 bits in CSI part 1, 2 bits in CSI part 2

\- 40 bits: 20 bits in CSI part 1, 20 bits in CSI part 2

The 7 bits UCI information case is further defined with the bitmap \[c0
c1 c2 c3 c4\] = \[0 1 0 1 0\] for CSI part 1 information, where c0 is
mapping to the RI information, and with the bitmap \[c0 c1\] = \[1 0\]
for CSI part 2 information.

The 40 bits UCI information case is assumed random information bit
selection.

In both tests, PUSCH data, CSI part 1 and CSI part 2 are transmitted
simultaneously.

Which specific test(s) is applicable to IAB-DU is based on the test
applicability rule defined in clause 8.1.1.3.2.

##### 8.1.2.3.2 Minimum Requirement

For *IAB type 1-O*, the minimum requirement is in TS 38.174 \[2\]
clause 11.1.2.1.3.

For *IAB type 2-O*, the minimum requirement is in TS 38.174 \[2\]
clause 11.1.2.2.3.

##### 8.1.2.3.3 Test Purpose

The test shall verify the receiver\'s ability to detect UCI with CSI
part 1 and CSI part 2 bits multiplexed on PUSCH under multipath fading
propagation conditions for a given SNR.

##### 8.1.2.3.4 Method of test

##### 8.1.2.3.4.1 Initial Conditions {#initial-conditions-27 .H6}

Test environment: Normal; see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier: M; see clause 4.9.1

Direction to be tested: OTA REFSENS *receiver target reference
direction* (see D.54 in table 4.6-1).

##### 8.1.2.3.4.2 Procedure {#procedure-23 .H6}

> 1\) Place the IAB-DU with its manufacturer declared coordinate system
> reference point in the same place as calibrated point in the test
> system, as shown in annex E.3.
>
> 2\) Align the manufacturer declared coordinate system orientation of
> the IAB-DU with the test system.
>
> 3\) Set the IAB-DU in the declared direction to be tested.
>
> 4\) Connect the IAB-DU tester generating the wanted signal, multipath
> fading simulators and AWGN generators to a test antenna via a
> combining network in OTA test setup, as shown in annex E.3. Each of
> the demodulation branch signals should be transmitted on one
> polarization of the test antenna(s).
>
> 5\) The characteristics of the wanted signal shall be configured to
> the corresponding UL reference measurement channel defined in annex A,
> and according to additional test parameters listed in table
> 8.1.2.3.4.2-1. The UCI information bit payload per slot is equal to
> 7bits with CSI part 1 5bits, CSI part 2 2bits, and the UCI information
> bit payload per slot is equal to 40 bits with CSI part 1 20bits, CSI
> part 2 20 bits.

### 8.1.3 Performance requirements for PUСCH

#### 8.1.3.1 Performance requirements for PUCCH format 0

##### 8.1.3.1.1 Definition and applicability

The performance requirement of single user PUCCH format 0 for ACK missed
detection is determined by the two parameters: probability of false
detection of the ACK and the probability of detection of ACK. The
performance is measured by the required SNR at probability of detection
equal to 0.99. The probability of false detection of the ACK shall be
0.01 or less.

The probability of false detection of the ACK is defined as a
conditional probability of erroneous detection of the ACK when input is
only noise.

The probability of detection of ACK is defined as conditional
probability of detection of the ACK when the signal is present.

The transient period as specified in TS 38.101-1 \[16\] clause 6.3.3.1
and TS 38.101-2 \[17\] clause 6.3.3.1 is not taken into account for
performance requirement testing, where the RB hopping is symmetric to
the CC center, i.e. intra-slot frequency hopping is enabled.

Which specific test(s) are applicable to IAB-DU is based on the test
applicability rules defined in clause 8.1.1.3.3.

##### 8.1.3.1.2 Minimum Requirement

For *IAB type 1-O*, the minimum requirements are in TS 38.174 \[2\]
clause 11.3.1.1 and 11.1.3.1.2.

For *IAB type 2-O*, the minimum requirements are in TS 38.174 \[2\]
clause 11.3.2.1 and 11.1.3.2.2.

##### 8.1.3.1.3 Test Purpose

The test shall verify the receiver\'s ability to detect ACK under
multipath fading propagation conditions for a given SNR.

##### 8.1.3.1.4 Method of test

##### 8.1.3.1.4.1 Initial Conditions {#initial-conditions-28 .H6}

Test environment: Normal, see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested: single carrier M; see clause 4.9.1.

Direction to be tested: OTA REFSENS *receiver target reference
direction* (see D.54 in table 4.6-1).

##### 8.1.3.1.4.2 Procedure {#procedure-24 .H6}

> 1\) Place the IAB-DU with its manufacturer declared coordinate system
> reference point in the same place as calibrated point in the test
> system, as shown in annex E.3.
>
> 2\) Align the manufacturer declared coordinate system orientation of
> the IAB-DU with the test system.
>
> 3\) Set the IAB-DU in the declared direction to be tested.
>
> 4\) Connect the BS tester generating the wanted signal, multipath
> fading simulators and AWGN generators to a test antenna via a
> combining network in OTA test setup, as shown in annex E.3. Each of
> the demodulation branch signals should be transmitted on one
> polarization of the test antenna(s).
>
> 5\) The characteristics of the wanted signal shall be configured
> according to TS 38.211 \[7\] and according to additional test
> parameters listed in table 8.1.3.1.4.2-1.

#### 8.1.3.2 Performance requirements for PUCCH format 1

##### 8.1.3.2.1 NACK to ACK detection

##### 8.1.3.2.1.1 Definition and applicability {#definition-and-applicability-33 .H6}

The performance requirement of PUCCH format 1 for NACK to ACK detection
is determined by the two parameters: probability of false detection of
the ACK and the NACK to ACK detection probability. The performance is
measured by the required SNR at probability of the NACK to ACK detection
equal to 0.1% or less. The probability of false detection of the ACK
shall be 0.01 or less.

The probability of false detection of the ACK is defined as a
conditional probability of erroneous detection of the ACK at particular
bit position when input is only noise. Each false bit detection is
counted as one error.

The NACK to ACK detection probability is the probability of detecting an
ACK bit when an NACK bit was sent on particular bit position. Each NACK
bit erroneously detected as ACK bit is counted as one error. Erroneously
detected NACK bits in the definition do not contain the NACK bits which
are mapped from DTX, i.e. NACK bits received when DTX is sent should not
be considered.

The transient period as specified in TS 38.101-1 \[16\] and
TS 38.101-2 \[17\] clause 6.3.3.1 is not taken into account for
performance requirement testing, where the RB hopping is symmetric to
the CC center, i.e. intra-slot frequency hopping is enabled.

Which specific test(s) are applicable to IAB-DU is based on the test
applicability rules defined in clause 8.1.1.3.3.

##### 8.1.3.2.1.2 Minimum Requirement {#minimum-requirement-32 .H6}

For BS type 1-O, the minimum requirement is in TS 38.174 \[2\],
clause 11.1.3.1.3.

For BS type 2-O, the minimum requirement is in TS 38.174 \[2\],
clause 11.1.3.2.3.

##### 8.1.3.2.1.3 Test Purpose {#test-purpose-33 .H6}

The test shall verify the receiver\'s ability not to falsely detect NACK
bits as ACK bits under multipath fading propagation conditions for a
given SNR.

##### 8.1.3.2.1.4 Method of test {#method-of-test-30 .H6}

##### 8.1.3.2.1.4.1 Initial Conditions {#initial-conditions-29 .H6}

Test environment: Normal; see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier: M; see clause 4.9.1

Direction to be tested: OTA REFSENS receiver target reference direction
(see D.54 in table 4.6-1).

##### 8.1.3.2.1.4.2 Procedure {#procedure-25 .H6}

> 1\) Place the IAB-DU with its manufacturer declared coordinate system
> reference point in the same place as calibrated point in the test
> system, as shown in annex E.3.
>
> 2\) Align the manufacturer declared coordinate system orientation of
> the IAB-DU with the test system.
>
> 3\) Set the IAB-DU in the declared direction to be tested.
>
> 4\) Connect the IAB-DU tester generating the wanted signal, multipath
> fading simulators and AWGN generators to a test antenna via a
> combining network in OTA test setup, as shown in annex E.3. Each of
> the demodulation branch signals should be transmitted on one
> polarization of the test antenna(s).
>
> 5\) The characteristics of the wanted signal shall be configured
> according to TS 38.211 \[7\], and according to additional test
> parameters listed in table 8.1.3.2.1.4.2-1.

##### 8.1.3.2.2 ACK missed detection

##### 8.1.3.2.2.1 Definition and applicability {#definition-and-applicability-34 .H6}

The performance requirement of PUCCH format 1 for ACK missed detection
is determined by the two parameters: probability of false detection of
the ACK and the probability of detection of ACK. The performance is
measured by the required SNR at probability of detection equal to 0.99.
The probability of false detection of the ACK shall be 0.01 or less.

The probability of false detection of the ACK is defined as a
conditional probability of erroneous detection of the ACK when input is
only noise.

The probability of detection of ACK is defined as conditional
probability of detection of the ACK when the signal is present.

The transient period as specified in TS 38.101-1 \[16\] and
TS 38.101-2 \[17\] clause 6.3.3.1 is not taken into account for
performance requirement testing, where the RB hopping is symmetric to
the CC center, i.e. intra-slot frequency hopping is enabled.

Which specific test(s) are applicable to IAB DU is based on the test
applicability rules defined in clause 8.1.1.3.3.

##### 8.1.3.2.2.2 Minimum Requirement {#minimum-requirement-33 .H6}

For *IAB type 1-O*, the minimum requirement is in TS 38.174 \[7\],
clause 11.1.3.1.3.

For *IAB type 2-O*, the minimum requirement is in TS 38.174 \[7\],
clause 11.1.3.2.3.

##### 8.1.3.2.2.3 Test Purpose {#test-purpose-34 .H6}

The test shall verify the receiver\'s ability to detect ACK bits under
multipath fading propagation conditions for a given SNR.

##### 8.1.3.2.2.4 Method of test {#method-of-test-31 .H6}

##### 8.1.3.2.2.4.1 Initial Conditions {#initial-conditions-30 .H6}

Test environment: Normal; see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier: M; see clause 4.9.1.

Direction to be tested: OTA REFSENS receiver target reference direction
(see D.54 in table 4.6-1).

##### 8.1.3.2.2.4.2 Procedure {#procedure-26 .H6}

> 1\) Place the IAB DU with its manufacturer declared coordinate system
> reference point in the same place as calibrated point in the test
> system, as shown in annex E.3.
>
> 2\) Align the manufacturer declared coordinate system orientation of
> the IAB DU with the test system.

#### 8.1.3.3 Performance requirements for PUCCH format 2

##### 8.1.3.3.1 ACK missed detection performance requirements

##### 8.1.3.3.1.1 Definition and applicability {#definition-and-applicability-35 .H6}

The performance requirement of PUCCH format 2 for ACK missed detection
is determined by the two parameters: probability of false detection of
the ACK and the probability of detection of ACK on the wanted signal.
The performance is measured by the required SNR at probability of
detection equal to 0.99. The probability of false detection of the ACK
shall be 0.01 or less.

The probability of false detection of the ACK is defined as a
probability of erroneous detection of the ACK when input is only noise.

The probability of detection of ACK is defined as probability of
detection of the ACK when the signal is present.

Which specific test(s) are applicable to IAB DU is based on the test
applicability rules defined in clause 8.1.1.3.

The transient period as specified in TS 38.101-1 \[16\] and
TS 38.101-2 \[17\] clause 6.3.3.1 is not taken into account for
performance requirement testing, where the RB hopping is symmetric to
the CC center, i.e. intra-slot frequency hopping is enabled.

##### 8.1.3.3.1.2 Minimum Requirement {#minimum-requirement-34 .H6}

For *IAB type 1-O*, the minimum requirement is in TS 38.174 \[2\]
clause 11.1.3.1.4.

For *IAB type 2-O*, the minimum requirement is in TS 38.174 \[2\]
clause 11.1.3.2.4.

##### 8.1.3.3.1.3 Test Purpose {#test-purpose-35 .H6}

The test shall verify the receiver\'s ability to detect ACK bits under
multipath fading propagation conditions for a given SNR.

##### 8.1.3.3.1.4 Method of test {#method-of-test-32 .H6}

##### 8.1.3.3.1.4.1 Initial Conditions {#initial-conditions-31 .H6}

Test environment: Normal, see clause B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier; M; see clause 4.9.1.

Direction to be tested: OTA REFSENS *receiver target reference
direction* (see D.54 in table.4.6-1).

##### 8.1.3.3.1.4.2 Procedure {#procedure-27 .H6}

##### 8.1.3.3.2 UCI BLER performance requirements

##### 8.1.3.3.2.1 Definition and applicability {#definition-and-applicability-36 .H6}

The UCI block error probability is defined as the probability of
incorrectly decoding the UCI information when the UCI information is
sent. The UCI information does not contain CSI part 2.

Which specific test(s) are applicable to IAB DU is based on the test
applicability rules defined in clause 8.1.2.

The transient period as specified in TS 38.101-1 \[16\] and
TS 38.101-2 \[17\] clause 6.3.3.1 is not taken into account for
performance requirement testing, where the RB hopping is symmetric to
the CC center, i.e. intra-slot frequency hopping is enabled.

##### 8.1.3.3.2.2 Minimum Requirement {#minimum-requirement-35 .H6}

For *IAB type 1-O*, the minimum requirement is in TS 38.174 \[2\]
clause 11.1.3.1.4.

For *IAB type 2-O*, the minimum requirement is in TS 38.174 \[2\]
clause 11.1.3.2.4.

##### 8.1.3.3.2.3 Test Purpose {#test-purpose-36 .H6}

The test shall verify the receiver\'s ability to detect UCI under
multipath fading propagation conditions for a given SNR.

##### 8.1.3.3.2.4 Method of test {#method-of-test-33 .H6}

##### 8.1.3.3.2.4.1 Initial Conditions {#initial-conditions-32 .H6}

Test environment: Normal, see clause B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier: M; see clause 4.9.1

Direction to be tested: OTA REFSENS *receiver target reference
direction* (see D.54 in table 4.6-1).

##### 8.1.3.3.2.4.2 Procedure {#procedure-28 .H6}

> 1\) Place the IAB DU with its manufacturer declared coordinate system
> reference point in the same place as calibrated point in the test
> system, as shown in annex E.3.
>
> 2\) Align the manufacturer declared coordinate system orientation of
> the IAB DU with the test system.
>
> 3\) Set the IAB DU in the declared direction to be tested.
>
> 4\) Connect the IAB DU tester generating the wanted signal, multipath
> fading simulators and AWGN generators to a test antenna via a
> combining network in OTA test setup, as shown in annex E.3. Each of
> the demodulation branches signals should be transmitted on each
> polarization of the test antenna(s).
>
> 5\) The characteristics of the wanted signal shall be configured
> according to TS 38.211 \[7\], and according to additional test
> parameters listed in table 8.1.3.3.2.4.2-1.

#### 8.1.3.4 Performance requirements for PUCCH format 3

##### 8.1.3.4.1 Definition and applicability

The performance is measured by the required SNR at UCI block error
probability not exceeding 1%.

The UCI block error probability is defined as the conditional
probability of incorrectly decoding the UCI information when the UCI
information is sent. The UCI information does not contain CSI part 2.

The transient period as specified in TS 38.101-1 \[16\] clause 6.3.3.1
and TS 38.101-2 \[17\] clause 6.3.3.1 is not taken into account for
performance requirement testing, where the RB hopping is symmetric to
the CC center, i.e. intra-slot frequency hopping is enabled.

Which specific test(s) are applicable to IAB DU is based on the test
applicability rules defined in clause 8.1.1.3.

##### 8.1.3.4.2 Minimum Requirement

For *IAB type 1-O*, the minimum requirement is in TS 38.174 \[7\],
clause 11.1.3.1.5.

For *IAB type 2-O*, the minimum requirement is in TS 38.174 \[7\],
clause 11.1.3.2.5.

##### 8.1.3.4.3 Test Purpose

The test shall verify the receiver\'s ability to detect UCI under
multipath fading propagation conditions for a given SNR.

##### 8.1.3.4.4 Method of test

##### 8.1.3.4.4.1 Initial Conditions {#initial-conditions-33 .H6}

Test environment: Normal; see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier: M; see clause 4.9.1

Direction to be tested:

\- OTA REFSENS *receiver target reference direction* (see D.54 in table
4.6-1).

##### 8.1.3.4.4.2 Procedure {#procedure-29 .H6}

> 1\) Place the IAB DU with its manufacturer declared coordinate system
> reference point in the same place as calibrated point in the test
> system, as shown in annex E.3.
>
> 2\) Align the manufacturer declared coordinate system orientation of
> the IAB DU with the test system.
>
> 3\) Set the IAB DU in the declared direction to be tested.
>
> 4\) Connect the IAB DU tester generating the wanted signal, multipath
> fading simulators and AWGN generators to a test antenna via a
> combining network in OTA test setup, as shown in annex E.3. Each of
> the demodulation branch signals should be transmitted on one
> polarization of the test antenna(s).
>
> 5\) The characteristics of the wanted signal shall be configured
> according to TS 38.211 \[7\], and according to additional test
> parameters listed in table 8.1.3.4.4.2-1.

#### 8.1.3.5 Performance requirements for PUCCH format 4

##### 8.1.3.5.1 Definition and applicability

The performance is measured by the required SNR at UCI block error
probability not exceeding 1%.

The UCI block error probability is defined as the conditional
probability of incorrectly decoding the UCI information when the UCI
information is sent. The UCI information does not contain CSI part 2.

The transient period as specified in TS 38.101-1 \[16\] and
TS 38.101-2 \[17\] clause 6.3.3.1 is not taken into account for
performance requirement testing, where the RB hopping is symmetric to
the CC center, i.e. intra-slot frequency hopping is enabled.

Which specific test(s) are applicable to BS is based on the test
applicability rules defined in clause 8.1.1.3.3.

##### 8.1.3.5.2 Minimum Requirement

For *IAB type 1-O*, the minimum requirement is in TS 38.174 \[2\],
clause 11.1.3.1.6.

For *IAB type 2-O*, the minimum requirement is in TS 38.174 \[2\],
clause 11.1.3.2.6.

##### 8.1.3.5.3 Test Purpose

The test shall verify the receiver\'s ability to detect UCI under
multipath fading propagation conditions for a given SNR.

##### 8.1.3.5.4 Method of test

##### 8.1.3.5.4.1 Initial Conditions {#initial-conditions-34 .H6}

##### 8.1.3.6.1.1 NACK to ACK detection {#nack-to-ack-detection-1 .H6}

##### 8.1.3.6.1.1.1 Definition and applicability {#definition-and-applicability-39 .H6}

The performance requirement of PUCCH format 1 for NACK to ACK detection
is determined by the two parameters: probability of false detection of
the ACK and the NACK to ACK detection probability. The performance is
measured by the required SNR at probability of the NACK to ACK detection
equal to 0.1% or less. The probability of false detection of the ACK
shall be 0.01 or less.

The probability of false detection of the ACK is defined as a
conditional probability of erroneous detection of the ACK at particular
bit position when input is only noise. Each false bit detection is
counted as one error.

The NACK to ACK detection probability is the probability of detecting an
ACK bit when an NACK bit was sent on particular bit position. Each NACK
bit erroneously detected as ACK bit is counted as one error. Erroneously
detected NACK bits in the definition do not contain the NACK bits which
are mapped from DTX, i.e. NACK bits received when DTX is sent should not
be considered.

Which specific test(s) are applicable to IAB DU is based on the test
applicability rules defined in clause 8.1.1.3.3.

##### 8.1.3.6.1.1.2 Minimum Requirement {#minimum-requirement-38 .H6}

### 8.1.4 Performance requirements for PRACH

#### 8.1.4.1 PRACH false alarm probability and missed detection

##### 8.1.4.1.1 Definition and applicability

The performance requirement of PRACH for preamble detection is
determined by the two parameters: total probability of false detection
of the preamble (Pfa) and the probability of detection of preamble (Pd).
The performance is measured by the required SNR at probability of
detection, Pd of 99%. Pfa shall be 0.1% or less.

Pfa is defined as a conditional total probability of erroneous detection
of the preamble (i.e. erroneous detection from any detector) when input
is only noise.

Pd is defined as conditional probability of detection of the preamble
when the signal is present. The erroneous detection consists of several
error cases -- detecting only different preamble(s) than the one that
was sent, not detecting any preamble at all, or detecting the correct
preamble but with the out-of-bounds timing estimation value. For AWGN,
TDLC300-100 and TDLA30-300, a timing estimation error occurs if the

The timing offset base value for PRACH preamble format 0 is set to 50%
of Ncs. This offset is increased within the loop, by adding in each step
a value of 0.1us, until the end of the tested range, which is 0.9us.
Then the loop is being reset and the timing offset is set again to 50%
of Ncs. The timing offset scheme for PRACH preamble format 0 is
presented in Figure 8.1.4.1.4.2-2.

adding in each step a value of 0.1us, until the end of the tested range,
which is 0.8us. Then the loop is being reset and the timing offset is

8.2 IAB-MT performance requirements
-----------------------------------

### 8.2.1 General

#### 8.2.1.1 Scope and definitions

Radiated performance requirements specify the ability of the *IAB-MT
type 1-O* and *IAB-MT type 2-O* to correctly demodulate signals in
various conditions and configurations. Radiated performance requirements
are specified at the RIB.

Radiated performance requirements for the IAB-MT are specified for the
fixed reference channels defined in annex A and the propagation
conditions in annex J. The requirements only apply to those FRCs that
are supported by the IAB-MT.

The radiated performance requirements for *IAB-MT type 1-O* and for
*IAB-MT type 2-O* are limited to two OTA *demodulations branches* as
described in clause 8.1.1.2. Conformance requirements can only be tested
for 1 or 2 *demodulation branches* depending on the number of
polarizations supported by the IAB-MT, with the required SNR applied
separately per polarization.

NOTE: IAB-MT can support more than 2 *demodulation branches*, however
OTA conformance testing can only be performed for 1 or 2 *demodulation
branches*.

The SNR used in this clause is specified based on a single carrier and
defined as:

> SNR = S / N

Where:

> S is the total signal energy in the slot on a single *TAB connector*
> (for *IAB-MT type 1-H*).
>
> N is the noise energy in a bandwidth corresponding to the transmission
> bandwidth over the duration of a slot on a single TAB connector (for
> *IAB-MT type 1-H*).

### 8.2.2 Demodulation performance requirements

#### 8.2.2.1 General

##### 8.2.2.1.1 Applicability rule for IAB-MT

##### 8.2.2.1.1.1 General {#general-23 .H6}

Unless otherwise stated, for an IAB-MT declared to support more than 2
demodulation branches (for *IAB-MT type 1-O* and *IAB-MT type 2-O*), the
performance requirement tests for 2 demodulation branches shall apply,
and the mapping between connectors and demodulation branches is up to
IAB-MT implementation.

The tests requiring more than \[20\] dB SNR level are set to N/A in the
test requirements.

##### 8.2.2.1.1.2 Applicability of requirements for different subcarrier spacings {#applicability-of-requirements-for-different-subcarrier-spacings-3 .H6}

Unless otherwise stated, the tests shall apply only for each subcarrier
spacing declared to be supported (see D.7 in table 4.6-1).

##### 8.2.2.1.1.3 Applicability of requirements for TDD with different UL-DL patterns {#applicability-of-requirements-for-tdd-with-different-ul-dl-patterns-1 .H6}

Unless otherwise stated, for each subcarrier spacing declared to be
supported, if IAB-MT supports multiple TDD UL-DL patterns, only one of
the supported TDD UL-DL patterns shall be used for all tests.

##### 8.2.2.1.1.4 Applicability of requirements for IAB-MT features {#applicability-of-requirements-for-iab-mt-features .H6}

Unless otherwise stated, for *IAB type 1-O*, the PDSCH 256QAM tests
(Test 1-1 of Clause 8.2.2.2.5.1) shall apply only for the 256QAM for
PDSCH for FR1 declared to be supported (see D.200 in table 4.6-1,
*pdsch-256QAM-FR1*).

Unless otherwise stated, for both *IAB type 1-O and IAB type 2-O*, the
PDSCH tests shall apply only in case the PDSCH MIMO rank in the test
case does not exceed the maximum number of PDSCH MIMO layers declared to
be supported (see D.202 in table 4.6-1, *maxNumberMIMO-LayersPDSCH*).

Unless otherwise stated, for *IAB type 2-O*, the PDSCH tests shall apply
only for the PT-RS option declared to be supported (see D.203 in table
4.6-1, *onePortsPTRS* (MSB)).

Note: Applicability information may be obtained based on vendor
declaration (Section 4.6) or alternatively from reading capability
signaling.

#### 8.2.2.2 Performance requirements for PDSCH

##### 8.2.2.2.1 Definition and applicability

The performance requirement of PDSCH is determined by a minimum required
throughput for a given SNR. The required throughput is expressed as a
fraction of maximum throughput for the FRCs listed in annex A. The
performance requirements assume HARQ re-transmissions.

Which specific test(s) are applicable to IAB-MT is based on the test
applicability rules defined in clause 8.2.2.1.1.

##### 8.2.2.2.2 Minimum requirements

For *IAB type 1-O*, the minimum requirement is in TS 38.174 \[2\],
clause 11.2.2.1.1.

For *IAB type 2-O*, the minimum requirement is in TS 38.174 \[2\],
clause 11.2.2.2.1.

##### 8.2.2.2.3 Test purpose

The test shall verify the receiver\'s ability to achieve throughput
under multipath fading propagation conditions for a given SNR.

##### 8.2.2.2.4 Method of test

##### 8.2.2.2.4.1 Initial conditions {#initial-conditions-38 .H6}

Test environment: Normal, see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier: M, see clause 4.9.1.

RF channels to be tested for carrier aggregation: M~BW\ Channel\ CA~;
see clause 4.9.1.

Direction to be tested: OTA REFSENS *receiver target reference
direction* (see D.54 in table 4.6-1).

##### 8.2.2.2.4.2 Test procedure {#test-procedure .H6}

> 1\) Place the IAB-MT with its manufacturer declared coordinate system
> reference point in the same place as calibrated point in the test
> system, as shown in annex E.3.
>
> 2\) Align the manufacturer declared coordinate system orientation of
> the IAB-MT with the test system.
>
> 3\) Set the IAB-MT in the declared direction to be tested.
>
> 4\) Connect the IAB-MT tester generating the wanted signal, multipath
> fading simulators and AWGN generators to a test antenna via a
> combining network in OTA test setup, as shown in annex E.3. Each of
> the demodulation branch signals should be transmitted on one
> polarization of the test antenna(s).
>
> 5\) The characteristics of the wanted signal shall be configured
> according to the corresponding DL reference measurement channel
> defined in annex A, and according to additional test parameters listed
> in table 8.2.2.2.4.2-1.

#### 8.2.2.3 Demodulation performance requirements for PDCCH

##### 8.2.2.3.1 Definition and applicability

The receiver characteristics of the PDCCH are determined by the
probability of miss-detection of the Downlink Scheduling Grant (Pm-dsg).

Which specific test(s) are applicable to IAB-MT is based on the test
applicability rules defined in clause 8.2.2.1.1.

##### 8.2.2.3.2 Minimum requirement

For *IAB type 1-O*, the minimum requirement is in TS 38.174 \[2\],
clause 11.2.2.1.2.

For *IAB type 2-O*, the minimum requirement is in TS 38.174 \[2\],
clause 11.2.2.2.2.

##### 8.2.2.3.3 Test purpose

The test shall verify the receiver\'s ability to detect the Downlink
Scheduling Grant (Pm-dsg) under multipath fading propagation conditions
for a given SNR.

### 8.2.3 CSI reporting requirements

#### 8.2.3.1 General

##### 8.2.3.1.1 Applicability of requirements

##### 8.2.3.1.1.1 General {#general-25 .H6}

Unless otherwise stated, for a IAB-MT declared to support more than 2
demodulation branches (for *IAB-MT type 1-O* and *IAB-MT type 2-O*), the
performance requirement tests for 2 demodulation branches shall apply,
and the mapping between connectors and demodulation branches is up to
IAB-MT implementation.

The tests requiring more than \[20\] dB SNR level are set to N/A in the
test requirements.

##### 8.2.3.1.1.2 Applicability of requirements for different subcarrier spacings {#applicability-of-requirements-for-different-subcarrier-spacings-4 .H6}

Unless otherwise stated, the tests shall apply only for each subcarrier
spacing declared to be supported (see D.7 in table 4.6-1).

##### 8.2.3.1.1.3 Applicability of requirements for TDD with different UL-DL patterns {#applicability-of-requirements-for-tdd-with-different-ul-dl-patterns-2 .H6}

Unless otherwise stated, for each subcarrier spacing declared to be
supported, if IAB-MT supports multiple TDD UL-DL patterns, only one of
the supported TDD UL-DL patterns shall be used for all tests.

##### 8.2.3.1.1.4 Applicability of PMI/RI requirements  {#applicability-of-pmiri-requirements .H6}

Testing of performance requirements for RI and PMI reporting is
optional.

##### 8.2.3.1.1.5 Applicability of requirements for IAB-MT features {#applicability-of-requirements-for-iab-mt-features-1 .H6}

Unless otherwise stated, for *IAB type 1-O*, the CSI reporting tests
(clauses 8.2.3.3, 8.2.3.4) shall apply only in case the number of
NZP-CSI-RS ports in the test case satisfies maximum number of ports
across all configured NZP-CSI-RS resources per CC declared to be
supported (see D.201 in table 4.6-1,
*maxConfigNumberPortsAcrossNZP-CSI-RS-PerCC*).

Unless otherwise stated, for *IAB type 1-O*, the CSI reporting tests
(clauses 8.2.3.2, 8.2.3.3, 8.2.3.4) shall apply only in case the PDSCH
MIMO rank in the test case does not exceed the maximum number of PDSCH
MIMO layers declared to be supported (see D.202 in table 4.6-1,
*maxNumberMIMO-LayersPDSCH*).

Unless otherwise stated, for *IAB type 2-O*, the CSI reporting tests
(clauses 8.2.3.2, 8.2.3.3, 8.2.3.4) shall apply only for the PT-RS
option declared to be supported (see D.203 in table 4.6-1, onePortPTRS).

NOTE: Applicability information may be obtained based on vendor
declaration (Section 4.6) or alternatively from reading capability
signaling.

##### 8.2.3.1.2 Common test parameters

Parameters specified in Table 8.2.3.1.2-1 are applied for all test cases
in this clause unless otherwise stated.

#### 8.2.3.2 Reporting of Channel Quality Indicator (CQI)

##### 8.2.3.2.1 Definition and applicability

The performance requirement of CSI reporting is determined by the
reporting variance and the BLER performance using the transport format
indicated by the reported CQI. The purpose is to verify that the
reported CQI values are in accordance with the CQI definition given in
TS 38.214 \[27\]. To account for sensitivity of the input SNR the
reporting definition is considered to be verified if the reporting
accuracy is met for at least one of two SNR levels separated by an
offset of 1 dB.

##### 8.2.3.2.2 Minimum requirement

The minimum requirement for *IAB-MT type 1-O* is in TS 38.174 \[2\]
clause 11.2.3.1.1

The minimum requirement for *IAB-MT type 2-O* is in TS 38.174 \[2\]
clause 11.2.3.2.2.

##### 8.2.3.2.3 Test purpose

The test shall verify the receiver\'s ability to report correct median
CQI and expected BLER performance under AWGN conditions.

##### 8.2.3.2.4 Method of test

##### 8.2.3.2.4.1 Initial conditions {#initial-conditions-40 .H6}

Test environment: Normal, see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier: M; see clause 4.9.1.

RF channels to be tested for carrier aggregation: M~BW\ Channel\ CA~;
see clause 4.9.1.

Direction to be tested: OTA REFSENS *receiver target reference
direction* (see D.54 in table 4.6-1).

##### 8.2.3.2.4.2 Procedure {#procedure-34 .H6}

> 1\) Place the IAB-MT with its manufacturer declared coordinate system
> reference point in the same place as calibrated point in the test
> system, as shown in annex E.3.
>
> 2\) Align the manufacturer declared coordinate system orientation of
> the IAB-MT with the test system.
>
> 3\) Set the IAB-MT in the declared direction to be tested.
>
> 4\) Connect the IAB-MT tester generating the wanted signal and AWGN
> generators to a test antenna via a combining network in OTA test
> setup, as shown in annex E.3. Each of the demodulation branch signals
> should be transmitted on one polarization of the test antenna(s).
>
> 5\) The characteristics of the wanted signal shall be configured
> according to the corresponding DL reference measurement channel
> defined in annex A, and according to additional test parameters listed
> in table 8.2.3.2.4.2-2 or 8.2.3.2.4.2-2.

#### 8.2.3.3 Reporting of Precoding Matrix Information (PMI)

##### 8.2.3.3.1 Definition and applicability

The minimum performance requirements of PMI reporting are defined based
on the precoding gain, expressed as the relative increase in throughput
when the transmitter is configured according to the IAB-MT reported PMI
compared to the case when the transmitter is using random precoding,
respectively. When the transmitter uses random precoding, for each PDSCH
allocation a precoder is randomly generated with equal probability of
each applicable i~1~ and i~2~ combination and applied to the PDSCH. A
fixed transport format (FRC) is configured for all requirements.

The requirements for transmission mode 1 with higher layer parameter
*codebookType* set to \'typeI-SinglePanel\' are specified in terms of
the ratio:

In the definition of *γ*, for 4TX, 8TX PMI requirements, is 90 % of the
maximum throughput obtained at using the precoders configured according
to the IAB-MT reports, and is the throughput measured at with random
precoding.

##### 8.2.3.3.2 Minimum requirement

The minimum requirement for *IAB-MT type 1-O* is in TS 38.174 \[2\]
clause 11.2.3.1.2.

The minimum requirement for *IAB-MT type 2-O* is in TS 38.174 \[2\]
clause 11.2.3.2.3.

##### 8.2.3.3.3 Test purpose

The test shall verify the receiver\'s ability to report correct PMI
under the defined fading conditions.

##### 8.2.3.3.4 Method of test

##### 8.2.3.3.4.1 Initial conditions {#initial-conditions-41 .H6}

Test environment: Normal, see annex B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier: M; see clause 4.9.1.

RF channels to be tested for carrier aggregation: M~BW\ Channel\ CA~;
see clause 4.9.1.

Direction to be tested: OTA REFSENS *receiver target reference
direction* (see D.54 in table 4.6-1).

##### 8.2.3.3.4.2 Procedure {#procedure-35 .H6}

> 1\) Place the IAB-MT with its manufacturer declared coordinate system
> reference point in the same place as calibrated point in the test
> system, as shown in annex E.3.
>
> 2\) Align the manufacturer declared coordinate system orientation of
> the IAB-MT with the test system.
>
> 3\) Set the IAB-MT in the declared direction to be tested.
>
> 4\) Connect the IAB-MT tester generating the wanted signal and AWGN
> generators to a test antenna via a combining network in OTA test
> setup, as shown in annex E.3. Each of the demodulation branch signals
> should be transmitted on one polarization of the test antenna(s).
>
> 5\) The characteristics of the wanted signal shall be configured
> according to the corresponding DL reference measurement channel
> defined in annex A, and according to additional test parameters listed
> in table 8.2.3.3.4.2-1.

##### 8.2.3.4.1 Definition and applicability

The purpose of this test is to verify that the reported rank indicator
accurately represents the channel rank. The accuracy of RI reporting is
determined by the relative increase of the throughput obtained when
transmitting based on the reported rank compared to the case for which a
fixed rank is used for transmission.

7\) Adjust the test signal mean power so the calibrated radiated SNR
value at the IAB-MT receiver is as specified in table 8.2.3.4.4.2-1 for
*IAB type 1-O* and *IAB type 2-O* respectively, and that the SNR at the
IAB-MT receiver is not impacted by the noise floor.

The power level for the transmission may be set such that the AWGN level
at the RIB is equal to the AWGN level in table 8.2.3.4.4.2-2.

########  Annex B (normative): Environmental requirements for the BS equipment

B.1 General
===========

For each test in the present document, the environmental conditions
under which the IAB is to be tested are defined.

For OTA requirements where it is not possible to environmentally control
the entire calibrated OTA chamber either localised control of the IAB
hardware or alternative OTA measurements which are then related to the
original specification are acceptable, see annex B.7.

B.2 Normal test environment
===========================

When a normal test environment is specified for a test, the test should
be performed within the minimum and maximum limits of the conditions
stated in table B.1.

Table B.1: Limits of conditions for normal test environment

  Condition             Minimum                                    Maximum
  --------------------- ------------------------------------------ ---------
  Barometric pressure   86 kPa                                     106 kPa
  Temperature           15 °C                                      30 °C
  Relative humidity     20 %                                       85 %
  Power supply          Nominal, as declared by the manufacturer   
  Vibration             Negligible                                 

The ranges of barometric pressure, temperature and humidity represent
the maximum variation expected in the uncontrolled environment of a test
laboratory. If it is not possible to maintain these parameters within
the specified limits, the actual values shall be recorded in the test
report.

NOTE: This may, for instance, be the case for measurements of radiated
emissions performed on an open field test site.

B.3 Extreme test environment
============================

B.3.1 General
-------------

The manufacturer shall declare one of the following:

> 1\) The equipment class for the equipment under test, as defined in
> the IEC 60 721-3-3 \[19\];
>
> 2\) The equipment class for the equipment under test, as defined in
> the IEC 60 721-3-4 \[20\];
>
> 3\) The equipment that does not comply with the mentioned classes, the
> relevant classes from IEC 60 721 \[21\] documentation for temperature,
> humidity and vibration shall be declared.

NOTE: Reduced functionality for conditions that fall outside of the
standard operational conditions is not tested in the present document.
These may be stated and tested separately.

B.3.2 Extreme temperature
-------------------------

When an extreme temperature test environment is specified for a test,
the test shall be performed at the standard minimum and maximum
operating temperatures defined by the manufacturer\'s declaration for
the equipment under test.

Minimum temperature:

The test shall be performed with the environment test equipment and
methods including the required environmental phenomena into the
equipment, conforming to the test procedure of IEC 60 068-2-1 \[22\].

Maximum temperature:

The test shall be performed with the environmental test equipment and
methods including the required environmental phenomena into the
equipment, conforming to the test procedure of IEC 60 068-2-2 \[23\].

NOTE: It is recommended that the equipment is made fully operational
prior to the equipment being taken to its lower operating temperature.

B.4 Vibration
=============

When vibration conditions are specified for a test, the test shall be
performed while the equipment is subjected to a vibration sequence as
defined by the manufacturer\'s declaration for the equipment under test.
This shall use the environmental test equipment and methods of inducing
the required environmental phenomena in to the equipment, conforming to
the test procedure of IEC 60 068-2-6 \[24\]. Other environmental
conditions shall be within the ranges specified in annex B.2.

NOTE: The higher levels of vibration may induce undue physical stress in
to equipment after a prolonged series of tests. The testing body should
only vibrate the equipment during the RF measurement process.

B.5 Power supply
================

When extreme power supply conditions are specified for a test, the test
shall be performed at the standard upper and lower limits of operating
voltage defined by manufacturer\'s declaration for the equipment under
test.

Upper voltage limit:

The equipment shall be supplied with a voltage equal to the upper limit
declared by the manufacturer (as measured at the input terminals to the
equipment). The tests shall be carried out at the steady state minimum
and maximum temperature limits declared by the manufacturer for the
equipment, to the methods described in IEC 60 068-2-1 \[10\] Test Ab/Ad
and IEC 60 068-2-2 \[11\] Test Bb/Bd: Dry heat.

Lower voltage limit:

The equipment shall be supplied with a voltage equal to the lower limit
declared by the manufacturer (as measured at the input terminals to the
equipment). The tests shall be carried out at the steady state minimum
and maximum temperature limits declared by the manufacturer for the
equipment, to the methods described in IEC 60 068-2-1 \[10\] Test Ab/Ad
and IEC 60 068-2-2 \[11\] Test Bb/Bd: Dry heat.

B.6 Measurement of test environments
====================================

The measurement accuracy of the IAB test environments defined in annex B
shall be:

Pressure: ±5 kPa

Temperature: ±2 degrees

Relative humidity: ±5 %

DC voltage: ±1.0 %

AC voltage: ±1.5 %

Vibration: 10 %

Vibration frequency: 0.1 Hz

The above values shall apply unless the test environment is otherwise
controlled and the specification for the control of the test environment
specifies the uncertainty for the parameter.

B.7 OTA extreme test methods
============================

B.7.1 Direct far field method
-----------------------------

The IAB under test is placed inside a sealed RF transparent
environmental enclosure, as showed in Figure B.7.1-1. This is connected
to an environment control system which regulates the temperature inside
the enclosure. The remaining equipment inside the OTA chamber (any
suitable antenna test range chamber type is acceptable) is outside the
environmental control and is at nominal temperature. Positioners, test
antennas and all other OTA test equipment do not need to be specified
over the extreme temperature range.

Figure B.7.1-1: Measurement set up for extreme conditions for EIRP
accuracy using direct far field method

The presence of the environmental chamber inside the OTA chamber may
affect the measurement accuracy due to additional reflections and
refractions, also the loss through the environmental enclosure may not
be consistent with direction as the path through the radome may vary
with angle. Hence the system should be calibrated in all tested
directions, frequencies and temperatures if necessary.

NOTE: Currently only a single direction is specified for extreme testing
so a single calibration direction is sufficient.

Conformance may be demonstrated by measuring the difference between the
nominal measurement and the extreme measurement (Δ~sample~) or by
measuring P~max,c,EIRP,\ extreme~ directly.

Measure EIRP for any two orthogonal polarizations (denoted p1 and p2)
and calculate total radiated transmit power for particular *beam
direction pair* as EIRP = EIRP~p1~ + EIRP~p2~.

B.7.2 Relative method
---------------------

The IAB under test is placed inside a small (compared to a far field
chamber) anechoic chamber which is both RF a screened and suitable for
environmental conditioning. The RF conditions inside the chamber are
absorptive and capable of dissipating the power of the IAB when
radiating. A sample antenna or RF probe are placed in a location which
gives a sample of the main beam EIRP but does not have to accurately
measure the EIRP directly, instead the near-field response is measured.
For this method test components are exposed to the full temperature
range for example the test antenna/probe, cables, absorbers etc. may
change as a function of temperature.

Using the relative method it is also necessary to measure the EIRP under
nominal conditions using an appropriately calibrated far field (or near
filed) test range to obtain P~max,c,EIRP~.

![](media/image40.emf){width="5.121527777777778in"
height="2.661111111111111in"}

Figure B.7.2-1: Measurement set up for extreme conditions for EIRP
accuracy using difference method

Measurements from the test antenna/probe are taken under nominal
conditions and extreme conditions to calculate (Δ~sample~). The
difference between the nominal and extreme conditions (Δ~sample~) is
then used along with the nominal EIRP measurement (P~max,c,EIRP~) made
in the appropriate far field or near field chamber and compared against
the extreme requirement. As follows:

P~max,c,EIRP,\ extreme~ = P~max,c,EIRP~ + Δ~sample~.

Measure EIRP for any two orthogonal polarizations (denoted p1 and p2)
and calculate total radiated transmit power for particular *beam
direction pair* as EIRP = EIRP~p1~ + EIRP~p2~.

########  Annex C (informative): Test tolerances and derivation of test requirements

The test requirements explicitly defined in the present document have
been calculated by relaxing the minimum requirements of the core
specification TS 38.174 \[2\] using the test tolerances (TT) defined
here. When the TT value is zero, the test requirement will be the same
as the minimum requirement. When the TT value is non-zero, the test
requirements will differ from the minimum requirements, and the formula
used for this relaxation is given in the following tables.

The TT~OTA~ values are derived from OTA Test System uncertainties,
regulatory requirements and criticality to system performance. As a
result, the TT~OTA~ values may sometimes be set to zero.

The TT~OTA~ values should not be modified for any reason e.g. to take
account of commonly known OTA Test System errors (such as mismatch,
cable loss, etc.).

Note that a formula for applying TT~OTA~ values is provided for all OTA
tests, even those with a test tolerance of zero. This is necessary in
the case where the OTA Test System uncertainty is greater than that
allowed in clause 4.1.2. In this event, the excess error shall be
subtracted from the defined TT~OTA~ value in order to generate the
correct tightened test requirements as defined in this annex.

########  Annex F (normative): Void

########  Annex G (informative): Transmitter spatial emissions declaration

G.1 General
===========

The transmitter spatial emission declaration is an optional declaration
which provides additional information on the power level of emission in
the intended (in cell) spatial directions and the unintended (out of
cell) spatial directions. The declarations are only valid when the beam
is configured in one of the EIRP conformance directions.

![](media/image58.emf){width="4.236111111111111in"
height="3.4930555555555554in"}

Figure G.1-1: Example of out of cell directions set and declared single
beam at a single extreme steering direction

The declaration of unwanted spatial emission may in many circumstances
not directly relate to system performance on its own. This is because it
is often not possible to differentiate wanted and unwanted radiation,
and furthermore because the benefits of optimizing beamforming
performance may outweigh the impacts of \"unwanted\" radiation, leading
to systems with apparently higher unwanted radiation also providing
superior throughput performance. System performance should additionally
be characterized taking all factors into account.

G.2 Declarations
================

Table G.2-1: Optional manufacturer declarations

  Declaration identifier   Declaration                       Description
  ------------------------ --------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Dxx.1                    Out of cell directions set        The set of directions which are outside the intended directions of radiation or outside the wanted cell. Declared per operating band.
  Dxx.2                    Out of cell power level           Declared in band average power inside each of the out of cell directions set(s) (DE.1) declared for each of the 5 conformance directions (D9.x)
  Dxx.3                    In cell power level               Declared in band average power outside the out of cell directions set(s) (DE.1) declared for each of the 5 conformance directions (D9.x)
  Dxx.4                    Average out of cell power level   Declared in band average power inside each of the out of cell directions set(s) (DE.1) averaged over the 5 conformance directions (D9.x).
  DE.5                     Average in cell power level       Declared in band average power inside each of the out of cell directions set(s) (DE.1) averaged over the 5 conformance directions (D9.x)

NOTE 1: The declaration of unwanted spatial emission may in many
circumstances not directly relate to system performance on its own. This
is because it is often not possible to differentiate wanted and unwanted
radiation, and furthermore because the benefits of optimizing
beamforming performance may outweigh the impacts of \"unwanted\"
radiation, leading to systems with apparently higher unwanted radiation
also providing superior throughput performance. System performance
should additionally be characterized taking all factors into account.

NOTE 2: The average out of cell power level reflects the impact of out
of cell radiation on other cells more accurately than the out of cell
power level for individual test beams.

=========================================================

The Annex D in TS 38.104 \[4\] apply to FR2 IAB-DU.

H.2 Characteristics of the interfering signals for IAB-MT

########  Annex I (normative): TRP measurement procedures

The Annex I in TS38.141-2\[6\] applies to IAB.

########  Annex J (normative): Propagation conditions

J.1 Static propagation condition
================================

The propagation for the static performance measurement is an Additive
White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) environment. No fading or multi-paths exist
for this propagation model.

J.1.1 IAB-MT Receiver with 2 Rx
-------------------------------

For 1 port transmission the channel matrix is defined in the frequency
domain by:

domain by:

![](media/image60.wmf){width="0.8263888888888888in"
height="0.4513888888888889in"}.

height="0.4513888888888889in"}

J.2 Multi-path fading propagation conditions
============================================

The multipath propagation conditions consist of several parts:

\- A delay profile in the form of a \"tapped delay-line\", characterized
by a number of taps at fixed positions on a sampling grid. The profile
can be further characterized by the r.m.s. delay spread and the maximum
delay spanned by the taps.

\- A combination of channel model parameters that include the Delay
profile and the Doppler spectrum that is characterized by a classical
spectrum shape and a maximum Doppler frequency.

\- Different models are used for FR1 (410 MHz - 7.125GHz) and FR2 (24.25
GHz -- 52.6 GHz).

J.2.1 Delay profiles
--------------------

The delay profiles are simplified from the TR 38.901 \[26\] TDL models.
The simplification steps are shown below for information. These steps
are only used when new delay profiles are created. Otherwise, the delay
profiles specified in annex J.2.1.1 and J.2.1.2 can be used as such.

> Step 1: Use the original TDL model from TR 38.901 \[26\].
>
> Step 2: Re-order the taps in ascending delays.
>
> Step 3: Perform delay scaling according to the procedure described in
> clause 7.7.3 in TR 38.901 \[26\].
>
> Step 4: Apply the quantization to the delay resolution 5 ns. This is
> done simply by rounding the tap delays to the nearest multiple of the
> delay resolution.
>
> Step 5: If multiple taps are rounded to the same delay bin, merge them
> by calculating their linear power sum.
>
> Step 6: If there are more than 12 taps in the quantized model, merge
> the taps as follows:

\- Find the weakest tap from all taps (both merged and unmerged taps are
considered)

\- If there are two or more taps having the same value and are the
weakest, select the tap with the smallest delay as the weakest tap.

\- When the weakest tap is the first delay tap, merge taps as follows:

\- Update the power of the first delay tap as the linear power sum of
the weakest tap and the second delay tap.

\- Remove the second delay tap.

> \- When the weakest tap is the last delay tap, merge taps as follows:

\- Update the power of the last delay tap as the linear power sum of the
second-to-last tap and the last tap.

\- Remove the second-to-last tap.

> \- Otherwise:
>
> \- For each side of the weakest tap, identify the neighbour tap that
> has the smaller delay difference to the weakest tap.
>
> \- When the delay difference between the weakest tap and the
> identified neighbour tap on one side equals the delay difference
> between the weakest tap and the identified neighbour tap on the other
> side.
>
> \- Select the neighbour tap that is weaker in power for merging.
>
> \- Otherwise, select the neighbour tap that has smaller delay
> difference for merging.
>
> \- To merge, the power of the merged tap is the linear sum of the
> power of the weakest tap and the selected tap.
>
> \- When the selected tap is the first tap, the location of the merged
> tap is the location of the first tap. The weakest tap is removed.
>
> \- When the selected tap is the last tap, the location of the merged
> tap is the location of the last tap. The weakest tap is removed.

NOTE 1: Some values of the delay profile created by the simplification
steps may differ from the values in tables J.2.1.1-2, J.2.1.1-3,
J.2.1.1-4, and J.2.1.2-2 for the corresponding model.

NOTE 2: For Step 5 and Step 6, the power values are expressed in the
linear domain using 6 digits of precision. The operations are in the
linear domain.

The correlation matrices for high, medium and low correlation are
defined in tables J.2.3.1.2-2, J.2.3.1.2-3 and J.2.3.1.2-4 as below.

The values in table J.2.3.1.2-2 have been adjusted for the 2x4 and 4x4
high correlation cases to ensure the correlation matrix is positive
semi-definite after round-off to 4 digit precision. This is done using
the equation:

![](media/image82.wmf){width="2.0in" height="0.3055555555555556in"}

Where the value \"a\" is a scaling factor such that the smallest value
is used to obtain a positive semi-definite result. For the 2x4 high
correlation case, a=0.00010. For the 4x4 high correlation case,
a=0.00012.

The same method is used to adjust the 4x4 medium correlation matrix in
table J.2.3.1.2-3 to ensure the correlation matrix is positive
semi-definite after round-off to 4 digit precision with a =0.00012.

NOTE: For completeness, the correlation matrices were defined for high,
medium and low correlation but performance requirements exist only for
low correlation.

### J.2.3.2 Multi-antenna channel models using cross polarized antennas

The MIMO channel correlation matrices defined in J.2.3.2 apply to two
cases as presented below:

\- One TX antenna and multiple RX antennas case, with cross polarized
antennas used at gNB

\- Multiple TX antennas and multiple RX antennas case, with cross
polarized antennas used at both UE and gNB

The cross-polarized antenna elements with +/-45 degrees polarization
slant angles are deployed at gNB. For one TX antenna case, antenna
element with +90 degree polarization slant angle is deployed at UE. For
multiple TX antennas case, cross-polarized antenna elements with +90/0
degrees polarization slant angles are deployed at UE.

For the cross-polarized antennas, the N antennas are labelled such that
antennas for one polarization are listed from 1 to N/2 and antennas for
the other polarization are listed from N/2+1 to N, where N is the number
of TX or RX antennas.

J.3 Physical signals, channels mapping and precoding
====================================================

J.3.1 General
-------------

Unless otherwise stated, the transmission on antenna port(s)
![](media/image139.png)![](media/image139.png) is defined by using a
precoder matrix of size ![](media/image141.png)![](media/image141.png),
where ![](media/image142.png)![](media/image142.png)is the number of
physical transmit antenna elements configured per test ,
![](media/image143.png)![](media/image143.png) is the number of ports
for a reference signal or physical channel configured per test, and
![](media/image144.png)![](media/image144.png) is the first port for
that reference signal or physical channel as defined in clauses 7.3 and
7.4 in TS 38.211 \[9\]. This precoder takes as an input a block of
signals for antenna port(s)
![](media/image139.png)![](media/image139.png),
![](media/image145.png)![](media/image145.png), , with being the number

to be mapped onto the frequency-time index pair as per the test
configuration but transmitted on different physical antenna elements:

![](media/image150.png)

For Clause 6 and 8, the transmission of PDCCH and PDCCH DMRS on antenna
port ![](media/image151.png)![](media/image151.png) is defined by using
a precoder matrix of size 2x1. This precoder takes as an input a block

which are to be mapped onto the frequency-time index pair as per the

elements:

![](media/image154.png)

The precoder matrix is specific to the test case configuration is
defined in Clause 5.2.2.2 of TS 38.214 \[24\].

The transmission on PT-RS antenna port is associated (using same
precoder) with the lowest indexed DM-RS antenna port among the DM-RS
antenna ports assigned for the PDSCH.

The physical antenna elements are identified by indices, where is the
number of physical antenna elements configured per test.

########  Annex K (informative): Measuring noise close to noise-floor

As the emission level seen by the measurement receiver (*P~UEM~*) for
co-location requirements are very low, it is suggested to measure
relative noise change instead of absolute noise level. For the situation
where the noise level is stable, the noise level change can be
identified by a relative noise measurement method. This method measures
the relative noise change extracted from when the test object is
operating and when the power is disconnected. From the two measured
noise levels the relative noise change can be determined. The relations
between measured noise change *δ~1~*, noise floor N~0~ and the relation
to *P~UEM~* with respect to the noise floor denoted *δ~2~* is visualized
in the left drawing in figure K-1.

![](media/image164.emf){width="2.75in" height="1.5104166666666667in"}
![](media/image165.png){width="2.8958333333333335in"
height="2.1770833333333335in"}

Figure K-1: Relative noise measurement

The absolute emission level in decibel scale is determined from a
relative measurement of *δ~1\ ~*as:

$P_{\text{UEM}} = N_{0} - \delta_{2}$

where *N~0~* is the noise floor of the measurement receiver and *δ~2~*
is plotted as function of *δ~1~* at the right in figure K-1. The
absolute noise floor of the measurement receiver, including probe
antenna, cables, filter and LNA is determined by a calibration
procedure. The calibration will determine the absolute emission level
(*N~0~*) accuracy of measuring out-of-band unwanted emission close to
the thermal noise floor.

########  Annex L (normative): In-channel TX tests for IAB-DU

The Annex H in TS 38.141-2 \[6\] applies to FR1 and FR2 IAB-DU.

######## Annex M (normative): In-channel TX tests for IAB-MT

M.0 Applicability
=================

IAB-MT EVM can be determined by the process according to following
alternatives:

\- Alternative 1: Annex E in TS 38.521-1 \[28\] for FR1 IAB-MT and Annex
E in TS 38.521-2 \[29\] for FR2 IAB-MT . Only CP-OFDM waveform of PUSCH
is measured for IAB-MT; or

\- Alternative 2: from Annex M.1 to Annex M.7.

M.1 General
===========

The in-channel TX test enables the measurement of all relevant
parameters that describe the In-channel quality of the output signal of
the TX under test in a single measurement process.

The parameters describing the in-channel quality of a transmitter,
however, are not necessarily independent. The algorithm chosen for
description inside this annex places particular emphasis on the
exclusion of all interdependencies among the parameters.

M.2 Basic principles
====================

The process is based on the comparison of the actual output signal of
the TX under test, received by an ideal receiver, with an ideal signal,
that is generated by the measuring equipment and represents an ideal
error free received signal. All signals are represented as equivalent
(generally complex) baseband signals.

The description below uses numbers and illustrations as examples only.
These numbers are taken from a TDD frame structure with normal CP
length, 120 kHz SCS and a transmission bandwidth configuration of 400
MHz (*N*~RB~ = 264). The application of the text below, however, is not
restricted to this parameter set.

M.2.1 Output signal of the TX under test
----------------------------------------

The output signal of the TX under test is acquired by the measuring
equipment and stored for further processing. It is sampled at a sampling
rate which is the product of the SCS and the *FFT size*, and it is named
$z\left( \upsilon \right)$.

For FR1, *FFT size* is determined by the transmission bandwidth in
TS 38.176-1 \[3\] table 6.5.3.5-2 for 15 kHz SCS, table 6.5.3.5-3 for 30
kHz SCS and table 6.5.3.5-4 for 60 kHz SCS.

For FR2, *FFT size* is determined by the transmission bandwidth in table
6.6.3.5.2-2 for 60 kHz SCS, and table 6.6.3.5.2‑3 for 120 kHz SCS. In
the time domain it comprises at least 10 ms. It is modelled as a signal
with the following parameters:

\- demodulated data content,

\- carrier frequency,

\- amplitude and phase for each subcarrier.

For the example in the annex, the *FFT size* is 4096 based on table
6.6.3.5.2-3. The sampling rate of 491.52 Msps is the product of the *FFT
size* and SCS.

M.2.2 Ideal signal
------------------

Two types of ideal signals are defined:

The first ideal signal $i_{1}\left( \upsilon \right)$ is constructed by
the measuring equipment according to the relevant TX specifications,
using the following parameters:

\- demodulated data content,

\- nominal carrier frequency,

\- nominal amplitude and phase for each subcarrier.

It is represented as a sequence of samples at the sampling rate
determined from annex M.2.1 in the time domain. The structure of the
signal is described in the test models.

The second ideal signal $i_{2}\left( \upsilon \right)$ is constructed by
the measuring equipment according to the relevant TX specifications,
using the following parameters for FR1 and FR2:

\- nominal demodulation reference signal and nominal PT-RS if present
(all other modulation symbols are set to 0 V),

\- nominal carrier frequency,

\- nominal amplitude and phase for each applicable subcarrier,

\- nominal timing.

It is represented as a sequence of samples at the sampling rate
determined from annex M.2.1 in the time domain.

M.2.3 Measurement results
-------------------------

The measurement results, achieved by the in-channel TX test are the
following:

\- Carrier frequency error.

\- EVM.

\- Resource element TX power.

\- OFDM symbol TX power (OSTP).

Other side results are: residual amplitude- and phase response of the TX
chain after equalisation.

M.2.4 Measurement points
------------------------

The resource element TX power is measured after the FFT box as described
in figure M.2.4-1 for FR1 and in figure M.2.4.2. The EVM shall be
measured at the point after the FFT and a zero-forcing (ZF) equalizer in
the receiver, as depicted in for FR1 in figure M.2.4-1 and for FR2 in
figure M.2.4-2. The FFT window of *FFT size* samples out of (*FFT size*
+ cyclic prefix length) samples in the time domain is selected in the
\"Remove CP\" box.

For FR1, The *FFT size* and the cyclic prefix length are obtained from
TS 38.176-1 \[3\] table 6.5.3.5-2 for 15 kHz SCS, table 6.5.3.5-3 for 30
kHz SCS and table 6.5.3.5-4 for 60 kHz SCS.

For FR2, *FFT size* and the cyclic prefix length is determined from
table 6.6.3.5.2-2 for 60 kHz SCS, and table 6.6.3.5.2‑3 for 120 kHz SCS.

In one subframe, there are two symbols with the length of the cyclic
prefix larger than the values listed in TS 38.176-1 \[3\] tables
6.5.3.5-2, 6.5.3.5-3 and 6.5.3.5-4 for FR1 and table 6.6.3.5.2-2 and
table 6.6.3.5.2-3 for FR2. Table M.2.4-1 lists the slot number and the
symbol number and the formula how to compute the length of cyclic prefix
for those two symbols according to the sampling rate.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For the example used in the annex, the \"Remove CP\" box selects 4096
samples out of 4384 samples. Symbol 0 of slot 0 and slot 4 has 256 more
samples in the cyclic prefix than the other symbols (the longer CP
length = 544).

Figure M.2.4-2: Reference point for FR2 EVM measurements

M.3 Pre-FFT minimization process
================================

Sample timing, carrier frequency in $z\left( \upsilon \right)$ are
varied in order to minimise the difference between
$z\left( \upsilon \right)$ and $i_{1}\left( \upsilon \right)$, after the
amplitude ratio of $z\left( \upsilon \right)$ and
$i_{1}\left( \upsilon \right)$ has been scaled. Best fit (minimum
difference) is achieved when the RMS difference value between
$z\left( \upsilon \right)$ and $i_{1}\left( \upsilon \right)$ is an
absolute minimum.

The carrier frequency variation is the measurement result: carrier
frequency error.

From the acquired samples, one value of carrier frequency error can be
derived.

NOTE 1: The minimisation process, to derive the RF error can be
supported by post-FFT operations. However the minimisation process
defined in the pre-FFT domain comprises all acquired samples (i.e. it
does not exclude the samples in-between the FFT widths and it does not
exclude the bandwidth outside the transmission bandwidth configuration).

NOTE 2: The algorithm would allow to derive carrier frequency error and
sample frequency error of the TX under test separately. However there
are no requirements for sample frequency error. Hence the algorithm
models the RF and the sample frequency commonly (not independently). It
returns one error and does not distinguish between both.

After this process the samples $z\left( \upsilon \right)$ are called
$z^{0}\left( \upsilon \right)$.

M.4 Timing of the FFT window
============================

The FFT window length is *FFT size* samples per OFDM symbol. For TDD,
the number of FFTs performed is the number of uplink symbols in the
measurement interval.

The position in time for the FFT shall be determined.

In an ideal signal, the FFT may start at any instant within the cyclic
prefix without causing an error. The TX filter, however, reduces the
window. The EVM requirements shall be met within a window *W* \< CP.
There are three different instants for FFT:

\- Centre of the reduced window, called $\mathrm{\Delta}\widetilde{c}$,

\- $\mathrm{\Delta}c - W/2$, and

\- $\mathrm{\Delta}c + W/2$.

The value of EVM window length *W* is obtained from the transmission
bandwidth and TS 38.176-1 \[3\] table 6.5.3.5-2 for 15 kHz SCS, table
6.5.3.5-3 for 30 kHz SCS and table 6.5.3.5-4 for 60 kHz SCS for FR1, and
table 6.6.3.5.2-2 for 60 kHz SCS, and table 6.6.3.5.2-3 for 120 kHz SCS
for FR2.

The IAB-MT shall transmit a signal according to the test models intended
for EVM. The demodulation reference signal of the second ideal signal
shall be used to find the centre of the FFT window.

The timing of the measured signal is determined in the pre FFT domain as
follows, using $z^{0}\left( \upsilon \right)$ and
$i_{2}\left( \upsilon \right)$:

> 1\. The measured signal is delay spread by the TX filter. Hence the
> distinct borders between the OFDM symbols and between data and CP are
> also spread and the timing is not obvious.
>
> 2\. In the ideal signal $i_{2}\left( \upsilon \right)$, the timing is
> known.
>
> Correlation between bullet (1) and (2) will result in a correlation
> peak. The meaning of the correlation peak is approximately the
> \"impulse response\" of the TX filter.
>
> 3\. The meaning of \"impulse response\" assumes that the
> autocorrelation of the ideal signal $i_{2}\left( \upsilon \right)$ is
> a Dirac peak and that the correlation between the ideal signal
> $i_{2}\left( \upsilon \right)$ and the data in the measured signal is
> 0. The correlation peak, (the highest, or in case of more than one
> highest, the earliest) indicates the timing in the measured signal.

The number of samples, used for FFT is reduced compared to
$z^{0}\left( \upsilon \right)$. This subset of samples is called
$z'\left( \upsilon \right)$.

From the acquired samples one timing can be derived.

The timing of the centre $\mathrm{\Delta}\widetilde{c}$ is determined
according to the cyclic prefix length of the OFDM symbols. For normal
CP, there are two values for $\mathrm{\Delta}\widetilde{c}$ in a 1 ms
period:

\- $\mathrm{\Delta}\widetilde{c}$ = length of cyclic prefix / 2,

\- $\mathrm{\Delta}\widetilde{c}$ = Longer CP length - length of cyclic
prefix / 2,

Where the length of cyclic prefix is obtained from TS 38.176-1 \[3\]
table 6.5.3.5-2 for 15 kHz SCS, table 6.5.3.5-3 for 30 kHz SCS and table
6.5.3.5-4 for 60 kHz SCS for FR1, and table 6.6.3.5.2-2 for 60 kHz SCS,
and table 6.6.3.5.2-3 for 120 kHz SCS for FR2, and the longer CP length
is obtained from table M.2.4-1.

As per the example values.

\- $\mathrm{\Delta}\widetilde{c} = 144$ within the CP of length 288 for
most OFDM symbols in 1 ms,

\- $\mathrm{\Delta}\widetilde{c} = 400$ (= 544 -- 144) within the CP of
length 544 for OFDM symbol 0 of slot 0 and slot 4.

M.5 Resource element TX power
=============================

Perform FFT on $z'\left( \nu \right)$ with the FFT window timing
$\mathrm{\Delta}\widetilde{c}$.

The result is called $Z'\left( t,f \right)$. The RE TX (RETP) power is
then defined as:

$$\text{RETP} = \left| Z'\left( t,f \right) \right|^{2}\text{SCS}$$

where SCS is the subcarrier spacing in Hz.

From RETP, the OFDM symbol TX power (OSTP) is derived as follows:

$$\text{OSTP} = \frac{1}{N_{\text{sym}}}\sum_{}^{}\text{RETP}$$

Where the summation accumulates $N_{\text{RB}}N_{\text{sc}}^{\text{RB}}$
values of all *N~sym~* OFDM symbols that carry PUSCH and not containing
PUCCH, SRS or PRACH within a slot.

$\ N_{\text{sc}}^{\text{RB}} = 12$.

For TDD, $N_{ul}$ is the number of slots with downlink symbols in a 10
ms measurement interval and is computed according to the values in table
4.9.2.2-1.

For the example used in the annex, $N_{ul} = 64$ and
$N_{\text{RB}} = 264$.

M.6 Post-FFT equalisation
=========================

Perform $14N_{ul}$ FFTs on $z'\left( \nu \right)$, one for each OFDM
symbol within 10 ms measurement interval with the FFT window timing to
produce an array of samples, $14N_{ul}$ in the time axis *t* by *FFT
size* in the frequency axis *f*.

For the example in the annex, 1120 FFTs are performed on
$z'\left( \nu \right)$. The result is an array of samples, 1120 in the
time axis by 4096 in the frequency axis.

The equalizer coefficients $\widetilde{a}\left( f \right)$ and
$\widetilde{\varphi}\left( f \right)$ are determined as follows:

> 1\. Calculate the complex ratios (amplitude and phase) of the post-FFT
> acquired signal $Z'\left( t,f \right)$ and the post-FFT ideal signal
> $I_{2}\left( t,f \right)$, for each demodulation reference signal,
> over 10 ms measurement interval. This process creates a set of complex
> ratios:

$a\left( t,f \right)e^{\text{jφ}\left( t,f \right)} = \frac{Z'\left( t,f \right)}{I_{2}\left( t,f \right)}$

> 2\. Perform time averaging at each demodulation reference signal
> subcarrier of the complex ratios, the time-averaging length is 10 ms
> measurement interval. Prior to the averaging of the phases
> $\text{\ φ}\left( t_{i},f \right)$ an unwrap operation must be
> performed according to the following definition:

\- The unwrap operation corrects the radian phase angles of
$\text{\ φ}\left( t_{i},f \right)$ by adding multiples of 2 \* π when
absolute phase jumps between consecutive time instances $t_{i}$ are
greater then or equal to the jump tolerance of π radians.

\- This process creates an average amplitude and phase for each
demodulation reference signal subcarrier (i.e. every second subcarrier).

$a\left( f \right) = \frac{\sum_{i = 1}^{N}{a\left( t_{i},f \right)}}{N}$

$\varphi\left( f \right) = \frac{\sum_{i = 1}^{N}{\varphi\left( t_{i},f \right)}}{N}$

> Where *N* is the number of demodulation reference signal time-domain
> locations $t_{i}$ from $Z'\left( t,f \right)$ for each demodulation
> reference signal subcarrier *f*.
>
> 3\. The equalizer coefficients for amplitude and phase
> $\widehat{a}\left( f \right)\ $ and
> $\widehat{\varphi}\left( f \right)$ at the demodulation reference

> DM-RS subcarriers within a set of contiguously allocated RBs is

>
> 4\. Perform linear interpolation from the equalizer coefficients

M.7 EVM
=======

M.7.0 General
-------------

For EVM create two sets of $Z_{\text{eq}}'\left( t,f \right)$, according
to the timing $\left( \mathrm{\Delta}c - W/2 \right)$ and
$\left( \mathrm{\Delta}c + W/2 \right)$, using the equalizer
coefficients from M.6.

The equivalent ideal samples are calculated from
$i_{1}\left( \upsilon \right)$ (annex M.2.2) and are called
$I\left( t,f \right)$.

The EVM is the difference between the ideal signal and the equalized
measured signal.

$\text{EVM} = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{\text{tϵT}}^{}{\sum_{\text{fϵF}\left( i \right)}^{}\left| Z_{\text{eq}}'\left( t,f \right) - I\left( t,f \right) \right|^{2}}}{\sum_{\text{tϵT}}^{}{\sum_{\text{fϵF}\left( i \right)}^{}\left| I\left( t,f \right) \right|^{2}}}}$

Where:

\- *T* is the set of symbols with the considered modulation scheme being
active within the slot,

\- $F\left( t \right)$ is the set of subcarriers within the resource
blocks with the considered modulation scheme being active in symbol *t*,

\- $I\left( t,f \right)$ *is* the ideal signal reconstructed by the
measurement equipment in accordance with relevant test models,

\- $Z_{\text{eq}}'\left( t,f \right)$ is the equalized signal under
test.

NOTE: Although the basic unit of measurement is one slot, the equalizer
is calculated over the entire 10 ms measurement interval to reduce the
impact of noise in the reference signals.

M.7.1 Averaged EVM (TDD)
------------------------

Let $N_{\text{ul}}^{\text{TDD}}$ be the number of slots with uplink
symbols within a 10 ms measurement interval. For TDD, the averaging in
the time domain can be calculated from $N_{\text{ul}}^{\text{TDD}}$
slots of different 10 ms measurement intervals and should have a minimum
of $N_{\text{ul}}$ slots averaging length where $N_{\text{ul}}$ is the
number of slots in a 10 ms measurement interval.

${\overline{\text{EVM}}}_{\text{frame}}$ is derived by: Square the EVM
results in each 10 ms measurement interval. Sum the squares, divide the
sum by the number of EVM relevant locations, square-root the quotient
(RMS).

${\overline{\text{EVM}}}_{\text{frame}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{\sum_{i = 1}^{N_{\text{ul}}^{\text{TDD}}}N_{i}}\sum_{i = 1}^{N_{\text{ul}}^{\text{TDD}}}{\sum_{j = 1}^{N_{i}}\text{EVM}_{i,j}^{2}}}$

*Where* $N_{i}$ is the number of resource blocks with the considered
modulation scheme in slot *i*.

The $\text{EVM}_{\text{frame}}$ is calculated, using the maximum of
${\overline{\text{EVM}}}_{\text{frame}}$at the window *W* extremities.
Thus ${\overline{\text{EVM}}}_{\text{frame,l}}$ is calculated using
$\widetilde{t} = \mathrm{\Delta}{\widetilde{t}}_{l}$ and
${\overline{\text{EVM}}}_{\text{frame,h}}$ is calculated
using$\widetilde{t} = \mathrm{\Delta}{\widetilde{t}}_{h}$ (*l* and *h*,
low and high; where low is the timing
$\left( \mathrm{\Delta}c - W/2 \right)$ and and high is the timing
$\left( \mathrm{\Delta}c + W/2 \right)$).

$\text{EVM}_{\text{frame}} = \max_{}\left( {\overline{\text{EVM}}}_{\text{frame,l}},{\overline{\text{EVM}}}_{\text{frame,h}} \right)$

In order to unite at least $N_{\text{dl}}$ slots, consider the minimum
integer number of 10 ms measurement intervals, where $N_{\text{frame}}$
is determined by

$N_{\text{frame}} = \left\lceil \frac{10 \times N_{\text{slot}}}{N_{\text{dl}}^{\text{TDD}}} \right\rceil$

And for FR1, $N_{\text{slot}} = 1$ for 15 kHz SCS, $N_{\text{slot}} = 2$
for 30 kHz SCS and $N_{\text{slot}} = 4$ for 60 kHz SCS normal CP. For
FR2, $N_{\text{slot}} = 4$ for 60 kHz SCS and $N_{\text{slot}} = 8$ for
120 kHz SCS.

Unite by RMS.

$\overline{\text{EVM}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N_{\text{frame}}}\sum_{k = 1}^{N_{\text{frame}}}\text{EVM}_{\text{frame},k}^{2}}$

The resulting $\overline{\text{EVM}}$is compared against the limit.
