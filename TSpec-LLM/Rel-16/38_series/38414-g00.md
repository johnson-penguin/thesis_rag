Foreword
========

This Technical Specification has been produced by the 3^rd^ Generation
Partnership Project (3GPP).

The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work
within the TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the
TSG modify the contents of the present document, it will be re-released
by the TSG with an identifying change of release date and an increase in
version number as follows:

Version x.y.z

where:

x the first digit:

1 presented to TSG for information;

2 presented to TSG for approval;

3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.

y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e.
technical enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.

z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been
incorporated in the document.

1 Scope
=======

The present document specifies the standards for user data transport
protocols and related signalling protocols to establish user plane
transport bearers over the NG interface.

IP Internet Protocol

NGAP NG Application Protocol

4 Data Link Layer
=================

Any data link protocol that fulfills the requirements toward the upper
layer may be used.

5 NG Interface user plane protocol
==================================

5.1 General
-----------

Both gNB and ng-eNB can be connected to the 5GC over the NG interface.

The transport layer for data streams over NG is an IP based Transport.
The following figure shows the transport protocol stacks over NG.

![](media/image3.wmf){width="1.363888888888889in" height="1.875in"}

Figure 5.1: Transport network layer for data streams over NG

The GTP-U (TS 29.281 \[3\]) protocol over UDP over IP shall be supported
as the transport for data streams on the NG interface. The data link
layer is as specified in clause 4.

The transport bearer is identified by the GTP-U TEID (TS 29.281 \[3\])
and the IP address (source TEID, destination TEID, source IP address,
destination IP address).

5.2 GTP-U
---------

The GTP-U (TS 29.281 \[3\]) protocol shall be used over the NG-U
interface toward the 5GC.

5.3 UDP/IP
----------

The path protocol used shall be UDP (IETF RFC 768 \[4\]).

The UDP port number for GTP-U shall be as defined in TS 29.281 \[3\].

The NG-RAN node and the 5GC shall support fragmentation and assembly of
GTP packets at the IP layer.

The NG-RAN node and the 5GC shall support IPv6 (IETF RFC 8200 \[5\])
and/or IPv4 (IETF RFC 791 \[6\]).

There may be one or several IP addresses in the NG-RAN node and in the
5GC. The packet processing function in the 5GC shall send downstream
packets of a given PDU Session to the NG-RAN node IP address (received
in NGAP) associated to that particular PDU Session. The packet
processing function in the NG-RAN node shall send upstream packets of a
given PDU Session to the 5GC IP address (received in NGAP) associated to
that particular PDU Session.

The Transport Layer Address signalled in NGAP messages is a bit string
of

> a\) 32 bits in case of IPv4 address according to IETF RFC 791 \[6\];
> or
>
> b\) 128 bits in case of IPv6 address according to IETF RFC 8200 \[5\];
> or
>
> c\) 160 bits if both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses are signalled, in which
> case the IPv4 address is contained in the first 32 bits.

5.4 Diffserv code point marking
-------------------------------

IP Differentiated Services code point marking (IETF RFC 2474 \[7\])
shall be supported. The mapping between traffic categories and Diffserv
code points shall be configurable by O&M based on 5QI, the Priority
Level (if explicitly signalled), and other NG-RAN traffic parameters
(e.g. ARP). Traffic categories are implementation-specific and may be
determined from the application parameters.
