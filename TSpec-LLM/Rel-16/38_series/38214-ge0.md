===============

Throughout this specification, unless otherwise noted, statements using
the term \"UE\" in clauses 4, 5, or 6 are equally applicable to the
IAB-MT part of an IAB node.

4.1 Power allocation for downlink 
---------------------------------

The gNB determines the downlink transmit EPRE.

For the purpose of SS-RSRP, SS-RSRQ and SS-SINR measurements, the UE may
assume downlink EPRE is constant across the bandwidth. For the purpose
of SS-RSRP, SS-RSRQ and SS-SINR measurements, the UE may assume downlink
EPRE is constant over SSS carried in different SS/PBCH blocks. For the
purpose of SS-RSRP, SS-RSRQ and SS-SINR measurements, the UE may assume
that the ratio of SSS EPRE to PBCH DM-RS EPRE is 0 dB.

For the purpose of CSI-RSRP, CSI-RSRQ and CSI-SINR measurements, the UE
may assume downlink EPRE of a port of CSI-RS resource configuration is
constant across the configured downlink bandwidth and constant across
all configured OFDM symbols.

The downlink SS/PBCH SSS EPRE can be derived from the SS/PBCH downlink
transmit power given by the parameter *ss-PBCH-BlockPower* provided by
higher layers. The downlink SSS transmit power is defined as the linear
average over the power contributions (in \[W\]) of all resource elements
that carry the SSS within the operating system bandwidth.

The downlink CSI-RS EPRE can be derived from the SS/PBCH block downlink
transmit power given by the parameter *ss-PBCH-BlockPower* and CSI-RS
power offset given by the parameter *powerControlOffsetSS* provided by
higher layers. The downlink reference-signal transmit power is defined
as the linear average over the power contributions (in \[W\]) of the
resource elements that carry the configured CSI-RS within the operating
system bandwidth.

For downlink DM-RS associated with PDSCH, the UE may assume the ratio of
PDSCH EPRE to DM-RS EPRE ( \[dB\]) is given by Table 4.1-1 according to
the number of DM-RS CDM groups without data as described in Clause
5.1.6.2. The DM-RS scaling factor specified in Clause 7.4.1.1.2 of \[4,
TS 38.211\] is given by .

Table 4.1-1: The ratio of PDSCH EPRE to DM-RS EPRE

  Number of DM-RS CDM groups without data   DM-RS configuration type 1   DM-RS configuration type 2

  2                                         -3 dB                        -3 dB

When the UE is scheduled with one or two PT-RS ports associated with the
PDSCH,

\- if the UE is configured with the higher layer parameter *epre-Ratio*,
the ratio of PT-RS EPRE to PDSCH EPRE per layer per RE for each PT-RS
port () is given by Table 4.1-2 according to the *epre-Ratio*, the PT-RS
scaling factor specified in clause 7.4.1.2.2 of \[4, TS 38.211\] is
given by.

\- otherwise, the UE shall assume *epre-Ratio* is set to state \'0\' in
Table 4.1-2 if not configured.

For link recovery, as described in clause 6 of \[6, TS 38.213\] the
ratio of the PDCCH EPRE to NZP CSI-RS EPRE is assumed as 0 dB.

5 Physical downlink shared channel related procedures
=====================================================

5.1 UE procedure for receiving the physical downlink shared channel
-------------------------------------------------------------------

For downlink, a maximum of 16 HARQ processes per cell is supported by
the UE. The number of processes the UE may assume will at most be used
for the downlink is configured to the UE for each cell separately by
higher layer parameter *nrofHARQ-ProcessesForPDSCH*, and when no
configuration is provided the UE may assume a default number of 8
processes.

A UE shall upon detection of a PDCCH with a configured DCI format 1\_0,
1\_1 or 1\_2 decode the corresponding PDSCHs as indicated by that DCI.
For any HARQ process ID(s) in a given scheduled cell, the UE is not
expected to receive a PDSCH that overlaps in time with another PDSCH.
The UE is not expected to receive another PDSCH for a given HARQ process
until after the end of the expected transmission of HARQ-ACK for that
HARQ process, where the timing is given by Clause 9.2.3 of \[6\]. Except
for the case when a UE is configured by higher layer parameter
*PDCCH-Config* that contains two different values of *coresetPoolIndex*
in *ControlResourceSet* and PDCCHs that schedule two PDSCHs are
associated to different *ControlResourceSets* having different values of
*coresetPoolIndex,* in a given scheduled cell, the UE is not expected to
receive a first PDSCH and a second PDSCH, starting later than the first
PDSCH, with its corresponding HARQ-ACK assigned to be transmitted on a
resource ending before the start of a different resource for the
HARQ-ACK assigned to be transmitted for the first PDSCH, where the two
resources are in different slots for the associated HARQ-ACK
transmissions, each slot is composed of symbols \[4\] or a number of
symbols indicated by *subslotLengthForPUCCH* if provided, and the
HARQ-ACK for the two PDSCHs are associated with the HARQ-ACK codebook of
the same priority. Except for the case when a UE is configured by higher
layer parameter *PDCCH-Config* that contains two different values of
*coresetPoolIndex* in *ControlResourceSet* and PDCCHs that schedule two
PDSCHs are associated to different *ControlResourceSets* having
different values of *coresetPoolIndex,* in a given scheduled cell, the
UE is not expected to receive a first PDSCH, and a second PDSCH,
starting later than the first PDSCH, with its corresponding HARQ-ACK
assigned to be transmitted on a resource ending before the start of a
different resource for the HARQ-ACK assigned to be transmitted for the
first PDSCH if the HARQ-ACK for the two PDSCHs are associated with
HARQ-ACK codebooks of different priorities. For any two HARQ process IDs
in a given scheduled cell, if the UE is scheduled to start receiving a
first PDSCH starting in symbol *j* by a PDCCH ending in symbol *i*, the
UE is not expected to be scheduled to receive a PDSCH starting earlier
than the end of the first PDSCH with a PDCCH that ends later than symbol
*i*. In a given scheduled cell, for any PDSCH corresponding to SI-RNTI,
the UE is not expected to decode a re-transmission of an earlier PDSCH
with a starting symbol less than *N* symbols after the last symbol of
that PDSCH, where the value of *N* depends on the PDSCH subcarrier
spacing configuration *μ,* with *N*=13 for *μ*=0, *N*=13 for *μ*=1,
*N*=20 for *μ*=2, and *N*=24 for *μ*=3.

When receiving PDSCH scheduled with SI-RNTI or P-RNTI, the UE may assume
that the DM-RS port of PDSCH is quasi co-located with the associated
SS/PBCH block with respect to Doppler shift, Doppler spread, average
delay, delay spread, spatial RX parameters when applicable.

When receiving PDSCH scheduled with RA-RNTI, or MSGB-RNTI, the UE may
assume that the DM-RS port of PDSCH is quasi co-located with the SS/PBCH
block or the CSI-RS resource the UE used for RACH association as
applicable, and transmission with respect to Doppler shift, Doppler
spread, average delay, delay spread, spatial RX parameters when
applicable. When receiving a PDSCH scheduled with RA-RNTI in response to
a random access procedure triggered by a PDCCH order which triggers
contention-free random access procedure for the SpCell \[10, TS
38.321\], the UE may assume that the DM-RS port of the received PDCCH
order and the DM-RS ports of the corresponding PDSCH scheduled with
RA-RNTI are quasi co-located with the same SS/PBCH block or CSI-RS with
respect to Doppler shift, Doppler spread, average delay, delay spread,
spatial RX parameters when applicable.

When receiving PDSCH in response to a PUSCH transmission scheduled by a
RAR UL grant or corresponding PUSCH retransmission, or when receiving
PDSCH in response to a PUSCH for Type-2 random access procedure, or a
PUSCH scheduled by a fallbackRAR UL grant or corresponding PUSCH
retransmission, the UE may assume that the DM-RS port of PDSCH is quasi
co-located with the SS/PBCH block the UE selected for RACH association
and transmission with respect to Doppler shift, Doppler spread, average
delay, delay spread, spatial RX parameters when applicable.

If the UE is not configured for PUSCH/PUCCH transmission for at least
one serving cell configured with slot formats comprised of DL and UL
symbols, and if the UE is not capable of simultaneous reception and
transmission on serving cell *c~1~* and serving cell *c~2~*, the UE is
not expected to receive PDSCH on serving cell *c~1~* if the PDSCH
overlaps in time with SRS transmission (including any interruption due
to uplink or downlink RF retuning time \[10\]) on serving cell *c~2~*
not configured for PUSCH/PUCCH transmission.

The UE is not expected to decode a PDSCH in a serving cell scheduled by
a PDCCH with C-RNTI, CS-RNTI or MCS-C-RNTI and one or multiple PDSCH(s)
required to be received according to this Clause in the same serving
cell without a corresponding PDCCH transmission if the PDSCHs partially
or fully overlap in time except if the PDCCH scheduling the PDSCH ends
at least 14 symbols before the earliest starting symbol of the PDSCH(s)
without the corresponding PDCCH transmission, where the symbol duration
is based on the smallest numerology between the scheduling PDCCH and the
PDSCH, in which case the UE shall decode the PDSCH scheduled by the
PDCCH.

The UE is not expected to decode a PDSCH scheduled with C-RNTI,
MCS-C-RNTI, or CS-RNTI if another PDSCH in the same cell scheduled with
RA-RNTI or MSGB-RNTI partially or fully overlap in time.

The UE in RRC\_IDLE and RRC\_INACTIVE modes shall be able to decode two
PDSCHs each scheduled with SI-RNTI, P-RNTI, RA-RNTI or TC-RNTI, with the
two PDSCHs partially or fully overlapping in time in non-overlapping
PRBs.

On a frequency range 1 cell, the UE shall be able to decode a PDSCH
scheduled with C-RNTI, MCS-C-RNTI, or CS-RNTI and, during a process of
P-RNTI triggered SI acquisition, another PDSCH scheduled with SI-RNTI
that partially or fully overlap in time in non-overlapping PRBs, unless
the PDSCH scheduled with C-RNTI, MCS-C-RNTI, or CS-RNTI requires
Capability 2 processing time according to clause 5.3 in which case the
UE may skip decoding of the scheduled PDSCH with C-RNTI, MCS-C-RNTI, or
CS-RNTI.

On a frequency range 2 cell, the UE is not expected to decode a PDSCH
scheduled with C-RNTI, MCS-C-RNTI, or CS-RNTI if in the same cell,
during a process of P-RNTI triggered SI acquisition, another PDSCH
scheduled with SI-RNTI partially or fully overlap in time.

The UE is expected to decode a PDSCH scheduled with C-RNTI, MCS-C-RNTI,
or CS-RNTI during a process of autonomous SI acquisition.

If the UE is configured by higher layers to decode a PDCCH with its CRC
scrambled by a CS-RNTI, the UE shall receive PDSCH transmissions without
corresponding PDCCH transmissions using the higher-layer-provided PDSCH
configuration for those PDSCHs.

If a UE is configured by higher layer parameter *PDCCH-Config* that
contains two different values of *coresetPoolIndex* in
*ControlResourceSet*, the UE may expect to receive multiple PDCCHs
scheduling fully/partially/non-overlapped PDSCHs in time and frequency
domain. The UE may expect the reception of full/partially-overlapped
PDSCHs in time, only when PDCCHs that schedule two PDSCHs are associated
to different *ControlResourceSets* having different values of
*coresetPoolIndex*. For a *ControlResourceSet* without
*coresetPoolIndex*, the UE may assume that the *ControlResourceSet* is
assigned with *coresetPoolIndex* as 0. When the UE is scheduled with
full/partially/non-overlapped PDSCHs in time and frequency domain, the
full scheduling information for receiving a PDSCH is indicated and
carried only by the corresponding PDCCH, the UE is expected to be
scheduled with the same active BWP and the same SCS. When the UE is
scheduled with full/partially-overlapped PDSCHs in time and frequency
domain, the UE can be scheduled with at most two codewords
simultaneously. When PDCCHs that schedule two PDSCHs are associated to
different *ControlResourceSets* having different values of
*coresetPoolIndex,* the following operations are allowed:

\- For any two HARQ process IDs in a given scheduled cell, if the UE is
scheduled to start receiving a first PDSCH starting in symbol *j* by a
PDCCH associated with a value of *coresetPoolIndex* ending in symbol
*i*, the UE can be scheduled to receive a PDSCH starting earlier than
the end of the first PDSCH with a PDCCH associated with a different
value of *coresetPoolIndex* that ends later than symbol *i*.

\- In a given scheduled cell, the UE can receive a first PDSCH in slot
*i*, with the corresponding HARQ-ACK assigned to be transmitted in slot
*j*, and a second PDSCH associated with a value of *coresetPoolIndex*
different from that of the first PDSCH starting later than the first
PDSCH with its corresponding HARQ-ACK assigned to be transmitted in a
slot before slot *j*.

If PDCCHs that schedule corresponding PDSCHs are associated to the same
or different *ControlResourceSets* having the same value of
*coresetPoolIndex*, the UE procedure for receiving the PDSCH upon
detection of a PDCCH follows Clause 5.1.

A UE does not expect to be configured with *repetitionScheme* if the UE
is configured with higher layer parameter *repetitionNumber.*

When a UE is configured by higher layer parameter *repetitionScheme* set
to one of \'*fdmSchemeA\'*, \'*fdmSchemeB\'*, \'*tdmSchemeA\'*, if the
UE is indicated with two TCI states in a codepoint of the DCI field
*\'Transmission Configuration Indication\'* and DM-RS port(s) within one
CDM group in the DCI field \'*Antenna Port(s)\'*.

\- When two TCI states are indicated in a DCI and the UE is set to
\'*fdmSchemeA\',* the UE shall receive a single PDSCH transmission
occasion of the TB with each TCI state associated to a non-overlapping
frequency domain resource allocation as described in Clause 5.1.2.3.

\- When two TCI states are indicated in a DCI and the UE is set to
\'*fdmSchemeB\'*, the UE shall receive two PDSCH transmission occasions
of the same TB with each TCI state associated to a PDSCH transmission
occasion which has non-overlapping frequency domain resource allocation
with respect to the other PDSCH transmission occasion as described in
Clause 5.1.2.3.

\- When two TCI states are indicated in a DCI and the UE is set to
\'*tdmSchemeA\'*, the UE shall receive two PDSCH transmission occasions
of the same TB with each TCI state associated to a PDSCH transmission
occasion which has non-overlapping time domain resource allocation with
respect to the other PDSCH transmission occasion and both PDSCH
transmission occasions shall be received within a given slot as
described in Clause 5.1.2.1.

When a UE is configured by the higher layer parameter *repetitionNumber*
in *PDSCH-TimeDomainResourceAllocation*, the UE may expect to be
indicated with one or two TCI states in a codepoint of the DCI field
*\'Transmission Configuration Indication\'* together with the DCI field
\'*Time domain resource assignment*\' indicating an entry *which
contains repetitionNumber* in *PDSCH-TimeDomainResourceAllocation* and
DM-RS port(s) within one CDM group in the DCI field \'*Antenna
Port(s)\'*.

\- When two TCI states are indicated in a DCI with \'*Transmission
Configuration Indication*\' field, the UE may expect to receive multiple
slot level PDSCH transmission occasions of the same TB with two TCI
states used across multiple PDSCH transmission occasions in the
*repetitionNumber* consecutive slots as defined in Clause 5.1.2.1.

\- When one TCI state is indicated in a DCI with \'*Transmission
Configuration Indication*\' field, the UE may expect to receive multiple
slot level PDSCH transmission occasions of the same TB with one TCI
state used across multiple PDSCH transmission occasions in the
*repetitionNumber* consecutive slots as defined in Clause 5.1.2.1.

When a UE is not indicated with a DCI that DCI field \'*Time domain
resource assignment*\' indicating an entry *which contains
repetitionNumber* in *PDSCH-TimeDomainResourceAllocation*, and it is
indicated with two TCI states in a codepoint of the DCI field
*\'Transmission Configuration Indication\'* and DM-RS port(s) within two
CDM groups in the DCI field \'*Antenna Port(s)\'*, the UE may expect to
receive a single PDSCH where the association between the DM-RS ports and
the TCI states are as defined in Clause 5.1.6.2.

When a UE is not indicated with a DCI that DCI field \'*Time domain
resource assignment*\' indicating an entry *which contains
repetitionNumber* in *PDSCH-TimeDomainResourceAllocation*, and it is
indicated with one TCI states in a codepoint of the DCI field
*\'Transmission Configuration Indication\',* the UE procedure for
receiving the PDSCH upon detection of a PDCCH follows Clause 5.1.

If more than one PDSCH on a serving cell each without a corresponding
PDCCH transmission are in a slot, after resolving overlapping with
symbols in the slot indicated as uplink by
*tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon*, or by
*tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated*, a UE receives one or more PDSCHs
without corresponding PDCCH transmissions in the slot as specified
below.

‒ Step 0: set *j=0*, where *j* is the number of selected PDSCH(s) for
decoding. *Q* is the set of activated PDSCHs without corresponding PDCCH
transmissions within the slot

‒ Step 1: A UE receives one PDSCH with the lowest configured
*sps-ConfigIndex* within *Q*, set *j=j+1*. Designate the received PDSCH
as survivor PDSCH.

‒ Step 2: The survivor PDSCH in step 1 and any other PDSCH(s)
overlapping (even partially) with the survivor PDSCH in step 1 are
excluded from *Q*.

‒ Step 3: Repeat step 1 and 2 until *Q* is empty or *j* is equal to the
number of unicast PDSCHs in a slot supported by the UE

### 5.1.1 Transmission schemes

Only one transmission scheme is defined for the PDSCH, and is used for
all PDSCH transmissions.

#### 5.1.1.1 Transmission scheme 1

For transmission scheme 1 of the PDSCH, the UE may assume that a gNB
transmission on the PDSCH would be performed with up to 8 transmission
layers on antenna ports 1000-1011 as defined in Clause 7.3.1.4 of \[4,
TS 38.211\], subject to the DM-RS reception procedures in Clause
5.1.6.2.

### 5.1.2 Resource allocation

#### 5.1.2.1 Resource allocation in time domain

When the UE is scheduled to receive PDSCH by a DCI, the *Time domain
resource assignment* field value *m* of the DCI provides a row index *m*
+ 1 to an allocation table. The determination of the used resource
allocation table is defined in Clause 5.1.2.1.1. The indexed row defines
the slot offset *K~0~*, the start and length indicator *SLIV*, or
directly the start symbol *S* and the allocation length *L*, and the
PDSCH mapping type to be assumed in the PDSCH reception.

Given the parameter values of the indexed row:

\- The slot allocated for the PDSCH is *K~s~*, where , if UE is
configured with *ca-SlotOffset* for at least one of the scheduled and
scheduling cell, and *K~s\ ~*=
![](media/image12.wmf){width="1.0284722222222222in"
height="0.5145833333333333in"}, otherwise, and where *n* is the slot
with the scheduling DCI, and *K~0~* is based on the numerology of PDSCH,
and and are the subcarrier spacing configurations for PDSCH and PDCCH,
respectively, and

\- $N_{\text{slot,\ offset,\ }\text{PDCCH}}^{\text{CA}}$ and
$\mu_{\text{offset}\text{,}\text{PDCCH}}$ are the
$N_{\text{slot,\ offset}}^{\text{CA}}$ and the, respectively, which are
determined by higher-layer configured *ca-SlotOffset,* for the cell
receiving the PDCCH
respectively,$\ N_{\text{slot,\ offset,\ }\text{PD}\text{S}\text{CH}}^{\text{CA}}$
and $\mu_{\text{offset}\text{,}\text{PDSCH}}$ are the
$N_{\text{slot,\ offset}}^{\text{CA}}$ and the, respectively, which are
determined by higher-layer configured *ca-SlotOffset* for the cell
receiving the PDSCH, as defined in clause 4.5 of \[4, TS 38.211\].

\- The reference point *S~0~* for starting symbol *S* is defined as:

\- if configured with *referenceOfSLIVDCI-1-2*, and when receiving PDSCH
scheduled by DCI format 1\_2 with CRC scrambled by C-RNTI, MCS-C-RNTI,
CS-RNTI with *K~0~=0*, and PDSCH mapping Type B, the starting symbol *S*
is relative to the starting symbol *S~0~* of the PDCCH monitoring
occasion where DCI format 1\_2 is detected;

\- otherwise, the starting symbol *S* is relative to the start of the
slot using *S~0~=0.*

\- The number of consecutive symbols *L* counting from the starting
symbol *S* allocated for the PDSCH are determined from the start and
length indicator *SLIV*:

if then

else

where, and

\- the PDSCH mapping type is set to Type A or Type B as defined in
Clause 7.4.1.1.2 of \[4, TS 38.211\].

The UE shall consider the *S* and *L* combinations defined in table
5.1.2.1-1 satisfying for normal cyclic prefix and for extended cyclic
prefix as valid PDSCH allocations:

+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+

When receiving PDSCH scheduled by DCI format 1\_1 or 1\_2 in PDCCH with
CRC scrambled by C-RNTI, MCS-C-RNTI, or CS-RNTI with NDI=1, if the UE is
configured with *pdsch-AggregationFactor* in *pdsch-config*, the same
symbol allocation is applied across the *pdsch-AggregationFactor*
consecutive slots. When receiving PDSCH scheduled by DCI format 1\_1 or
1\_2 in PDCCH with CRC scrambled by CS-RNTI with NDI=0, or PDSCH
scheduled without corresponding PDCCH transmission using *sps-Config*
and activated by DCI format 1\_1 or 1\_2, the same symbol allocation is
applied across the *pdsch-AggregationFactor*, in *sps-Config* if
configured, or across the *pdsch-AggregationFactor* in *pdsch-config*
otherwise, consecutive slots. The UE may expect that the TB is repeated
within each symbol allocation among each of the
*pdsch-AggregationFactor* consecutive slots and the PDSCH is limited to
a single transmission layer. For PDSCH scheduled by DCI format 1\_1 or
1\_2 in PDCCH with CRC scrambled by CS-RNTI with NDI=0, or PDSCH
scheduled without corresponding PDCCH transmission using *sps-Config*
and activated by DCI format 1\_1 or 1\_2, the UE is not expected to be
configured with the time duration for the reception of
*pdsch-AggregationFactor* repetitions, in *sps-Config* if configured, or
across the *pdsch-AggregationFactor* in *pdsch-config* otherwise, larger
than the time duration derived by the periodicity P obtained from the
corresponding *sps-Config*. The redundancy version to be applied on the
*n*^th^ transmission occasion of the TB, where *n* = 0, 1,
...*pdsch-AggregationFactor* -1, is determined according to table
5.1.2.1-2 and \"*rv~id~* indicated by the DCI scheduling the PDSCH\" in
table 5.1.2.1-2 is assumed to be 0 for PDSCH scheduled without
corresponding PDCCH transmission using *sps-Config* and activated by DCI
format 1\_1 or 1\_2.

*If a UE is configured with higher layer parameter repetitionNumber or
if the UE is configured by repetitionScheme set to one of \'
fdmSchemeA\', \' fdmSchemeB\' and \'tdmSchemeA\', the* UE does not
expect to be configured with *pdsch-AggregationFactor.*

A PDSCH reception in a slot of a multi-slot PDSCH reception is omitted
according to the conditions in Clause 11.1 of \[6, TS38.213\].

The UE is not expected to receive a PDSCH with mapping type A in a slot,
if the PDCCH scheduling the PDSCH was received in the same slot and was
not contained within the first three symbols of the slot.

The UE is not expected to receive a PDSCH with mapping type B in a slot,
if the first symbol of the PDCCH scheduling the PDSCH was received in a
later symbol than the first symbol indicated in the PDSCH time domain
resource allocation.

When the UE is configured with *minimumSchedulingOffsetK0* in an active
DL BWP it applies a minimum scheduling offset restriction indicated by
the \'Minimum applicable scheduling offset indicator\' field in DCI
format 1\_1 or DCI format 0\_1 if the same field is available. When the
UE is configured with *minimumSchedulingOffsetK0* in an active DL BWP
and it has not received \'Minimum applicable scheduling offset
indicator\' field in DCI format 0\_1 or 1\_1, the UE shall apply a
minimum scheduling offset restriction indicated based on \'Minimum
applicable scheduling offset indicator\' value \'0\'. When the *minimum
scheduling offset restriction* is applied the UE is not expected to be
scheduled with a DCI in slot *n* to receive a PDSCH scheduled with
C-RNTI, CS-RNTI or MCS-C-RNTI with *K*~0~ smaller than
$\ \left\lceil K_{0min} \cdot \frac{2^{\mu^{'}}}{2^{\mu}} \right\rceil$,
where *K*~0min~ and $\mu$ are the applied minimum scheduling offset
restriction and the numerology of the active DL BWP of the scheduled
cell when receiving the DCI in slot *n,* respectively, and $\mu^{'}$ is
the numerology of the new active DL BWP in case of active DL BWP change
in the scheduled cell and is equal to $\mu$, otherwise. The minimum
scheduling offset restriction is not applied when PDSCH transmission is
scheduled with C-RNTI, CS-RNTI or MCS-C-RNTI in common search space
associated with CORESET0 and default PDSCH time domain resource
allocation is used, in the search space set provided by
*recoverySearchSpaceId* when monitoring PDCCH as described in \[6, TS
38.213\] or when PDSCH transmission is scheduled with SI-RNTI, MSGB-RNTI
or RA-RNTI. The application delay of the change of the minimum
scheduling offset restriction is determined in Clause 5.3.1.

The UE is not expected to be configured with *referenceOfSLIVDCI-1-2*
for serving cells configured for cross-carrier scheduling with a
scheduling cell of a different downlink SCS configuration.

When a UE is configured by the higher layer parameter *repetitionScheme*
set to \'*tdmSchemeA\'* and indicated DM-RS port(s) within one CDM group
in the DCI field \'*Antenna Port(s)\'*, the number of PDSCH transmission
occasions is derived by the number of TCI states indicated by the DCI
field *\'Transmission Configuration Indication\'* of the scheduling
DCI*.*

\- If two TCI states are indicated by the DCI field \'*Transmission
Configuration Indication*\', the UE is expected to receive two PDSCH
transmission occasions, where the first TCI state is applied to the
first PDSCH transmission occasion and resource allocation in time domain
for the first PDSCH transmission occasion follows Clause 5.1.2.1. The
second TCI state is applied to the second PDSCH transmission occasion,
and the second PDSCH transmission occasion shall have the same number of
symbols as the first PDSCH transmission occasion. If the UE is
configured by the higher layers with a value$\ \overline{K}$ in
*StartingSymbolOffsetK*, it shall determine that the first symbol of the
second PDSCH transmission occasion starts after $\overline{K}$ symbols
from the last symbol of the first PDSCH transmission occasion. If the
value$\ \overline{K}$ is not configured via the higher layer parameter
*StartingSymbolOffsetK*, $\overline{K}$ = 0 shall be assumed by the UE.
The UE is not expected to receive more than two PDSCH transmission
layers for each PDSCH transmission occasion. For two PDSCH transmission
occasions, the redundancy version to be applied is derived according to
Table 5.1.2.1-2, where $n = 0,\ 1$ applied respectively to the first and
second TCI state. The UE expects the PDSCH mapping type indicated by DCI
field \'*Time domain resource assignment*\' to be mapping type B, and
the indicated PDSCH mapping type is applied to both PDSCH transmission
occasions.

\- Otherwise, the UE is expected to receive a single PDSCH transmission
occasion, and the resource allocation in the time domain follows Clause
5.1.2.1.

When a UE configured by the higher layer parameter *PDSCH-config* that
indicates at least one entry *contains* *repetitionNumber* in
*PDSCH-TimeDomainResourceAllocation*,

\- If two TCI states are indicated by the DCI field \'Transmission
Configuration Indication\' together with the DCI field \'Time domain
resource assignment\' indicating an entry *which contains
repetitionNumber* in *PDSCH-TimeDomainResourceAllocation* and DM-RS
port(s) within one CDM group in the DCI field \'Antenna Port(s)\', the
same SLIV is applied for all PDSCH transmission occasions across the
*repetitionNumber* consecutive slots, the first TCI state is applied to
the first PDSCH transmission occasion and resource allocation in time
domain for the first PDSCH transmission occasion follows Clause 5.1.2.1.

When the value indicated by *repetitionNumber* in
*PDSCH-TimeDomainResourceAllocation* equals to two, the second TCI state
is applied to the second PDSCH transmission occasion. When the value
indicated by *repetitionNumber* in *PDSCH-TimeDomainResourceAllocation*
is larger than two, the UE may be further configured to enable
*cyclicMapping* or *sequenticalMapping* in *tciMapping*.

\- When *cyclicMapping* is enabled, the first and second TCI states are
applied to the first and second PDSCH transmission occasions,
respectively, and the same TCI mapping pattern continues to the
remaining PDSCH transmission occasions.

\- When *sequenticalMapping* is enabled, first TCI state is applied to
the first and second PDSCH transmission occasions, and the second TCI
state is applied to the third and fourth PDSCH transmission occasions,
and the same TCI mapping pattern continues to the remaining PDSCH
transmission occasions.

The UE may expect that each PDSCH transmission occasion is limited to
two transmission layers. For all PDSCH transmission occasions associated
with the first TCI state, the redundancy version to be applied is
derived according to Table 5.1.2.1-2, where $n$ is counted only
considering PDSCH transmission occasions associated with the first TCI
state. The redundancy version for PDSCH transmission occasions
associated with the second TCI state is derived according to Table
5.1.2.1-3, where additional shifting operation for each redundancy

\- If one TCI state is indicated by the DCI field \'Transmission
Configuration Indication\' together with the DCI field \'Time domain
resource assignment\' indicating an entry *which contains
repetitionNumber* in *PDSCH-TimeDomainResourceAllocation* and DM-RS
port(s) within one CDM group in the DCI field \'Antenna Port(s)\', the
same SLIV is applied for all PDSCH transmission occasions across the
*repetitionNumber* consecutive slots, the first PDSCH transmission
occasion follows Clause 5.1.2.1, the same TCI state is applied to all
PDSCH transmission occasions. The UE may expect that each PDSCH
transmission occasion is limited to two transmission layers. For all
PDSCH transmission occasions, the redundancy version to be applied is
derived according to Table 5.1.2.1-2, where $n$ is counted considering
PDSCH transmission occasions.

\- Otherwise, the UE is expected to receive a single PDSCH transmission
occasion, and the resource allocation in the time domain follows Clause
5.1.2.1.

##### 5.1.2.1.1 Determination of the resource allocation table to be used for PDSCH

Table 5.1.2.1.1-1 and Table 5.1.2.1.1-1A define which PDSCH time domain
resource allocation configuration to apply. Either a default PDSCH time
domain allocation A, B or C according to tables 5.1.2.1.1-2,
5.1.2.1.1-3, 5.1.2.1.1-4 and 5.1.2.1.1-5 is applied, or the higher layer
configured *pdsch-TimeDomainAllocationList* or
*pdsch-TimeDomainAllocationListDCI-1-2* is applied. For operation with
shared spectrum channel access, as described in \[16, TS 37.213\], UE
reinterprets *S* and *L* in row 9 of Table 5.1.2.1.1-2 as *S=6* and
*L=7*.

  Note 1: The UE may assume that this PDSCH resource allocation is not used, if the PDSCH was scheduled with SI-RNTI in PDCCH Type0 common search space                                                                               

#### 5.1.2.2 Resource allocation in frequency domain

Two downlink resource allocation schemes, type 0 and type 1, are
supported. The UE shall assume that when the scheduling grant is
received with DCI format 1\_0, then downlink resource allocation type 1
is used.

If the scheduling DCI is configured to indicate the downlink resource
allocation type as part of the \'*Frequency domain resource
assignment\'* field by setting a higher layer parameter
*resourceAllocation* in *PDSCH-Config* to \'dynamicSwitch\', for DCI
format 1\_1 or setting a higher layer parameter
*resourceAllocationDCI-1-2* in *PDSCH-Config* to \'dynamicSwitch\' for
DCI format 1\_2, the UE shall use downlink resource allocation type 0 or
type 1 as defined by this DCI field. Otherwise the UE shall use the
downlink frequency resource allocation type as defined by the higher
layer parameter *resourceAllocation* for DCI format 1\_1 or by the
higher layer parameter *resourceAllocationDCI-1-2* for DCI format 1\_2.

If a bandwidth part indicator field is not configured in the scheduling
DCI or the UE does not support active BWP change via DCI, the RB
indexing for downlink type 0 and type 1 resource allocation is
determined within the UE\'s active bandwidth part. If a bandwidth part
indicator field is configured in the scheduling DCI and the UE supports
active BWP change via DCI, the RB indexing for downlink type 0 and type
1 resource allocation is determined within the UE\'s bandwidth part
indicated by bandwidth part indicator field value in the DCI. The UE
shall upon detection of PDCCH intended for the UE determine first the
downlink bandwidth part and then the resource allocation within the
bandwidth part.

For a PDSCH scheduled with a DCI format 1\_0 in any type of PDCCH common
search space, regardless of which bandwidth part is the active bandwidth
part, RB numbering starts from the lowest RB of the CORESET in which the
DCI was received; otherwise RB numbering starts from the lowest RB in
the determined downlink bandwidth part.

##### 5.1.2.2.1 Downlink resource allocation type 0

In downlink resource allocation of type 0, the resource block assignment
information includes a bitmap indicating the Resource Block Groups
(RBGs) that are allocated to the scheduled UE where a RBG is a set of
consecutive virtual resource blocks defined by higher layer parameter
*rbg-Size* configured by *PDSCH-Config* and the size of the bandwidth
part as defined in Table 5.1.2.2.1-1.

Table 5.1.2.2.1-1: Nominal RBG size *P*

  Bandwidth Part Size   Configuration 1   Configuration 2
  --------------------- ----------------- -----------------
  1 -- 36               2                 4
  37 -- 72              4                 8
  73 -- 144             8                 16
  145 -- 275            16                16

The total number of RBGs () for a downlink bandwidth part *i* of size
PRBs is given by , where

\- the size of the first RBG is ,

\- the size of last RBG is if and *P* otherwise,

\- the size of all other RBGs is *P*.

The bitmap is of size bits with one bitmap bit per RBG such that each
RBG is addressable. The RBGs shall be indexed in the order of increasing
frequency and starting at the lowest frequency of the bandwidth part.
The order of RBG bitmap is such that RBG 0 to RBG are mapped from MSB to
LSB. The RBG is allocated to the UE if the corresponding bit value in
the bitmap is 1, the RBG is not allocated to the UE otherwise.

##### 5.1.2.2.2 Downlink resource allocation type 1

In downlink resource allocation of type 1, the resource block assignment
information indicates to a scheduled UE a set of contiguously allocated
non-interleaved or interleaved virtual resource blocks within the active
bandwidth part of size PRBs except for the case when DCI format 1\_0 is
decoded in any common search space in which case the size of CORESET 0
shall be used if CORESET 0 is configured for the cell and the size of
initial DL bandwidth part shall be used if CORESET 0 is not configured
for the cell.

A downlink type 1 resource allocation field consists of a resource
indication value (*RIV*) corresponding to a starting virtual resource
block () and a length in terms of contiguously allocated resource
blocks. The resource indication value is defined by

if then

else

where≥ 1 and shall not exceed .

When the DCI size for DCI format 1\_0 in USS is derived from the size of
DCI format 1\_0 in CSS but applied to an active BWP with size of , a
downlink type 1 resource block assignment field consists of a resource
indication value (*RIV*) corresponding to a starting resource block and
a length in terms of virtually contiguously allocated resource blocks ,
where is given by

\- the size of CORESET 0 if CORESET 0 is configured for the cell;

\- the size of initial DL bandwidth part if CORESET 0 is not configured
for the cell.

The resource indication value is defined by:

if then

else

where, and where shall not exceed .

If , *K* is the maximum value from set {1, 2, 4, 8} which satisfies ;
otherwise *K* = 1.

When the scheduling grant is received with DCI format 1\_2, a downlink
type 1 resource allocation field consists of a resource indication value
(*RIV*) corresponding to a starting resource block group *RBG~start~*=0,
1, ..., *N~RBG~*-1 and a length in terms of virtually contiguously
allocated resource block groups *L~RBGs~*=1, ..., *N~RBG~*, where the
resource block groups are defined as in 5.1.2.2.1 with *P* defined by
*resourceAllocationType1GranularityDCI-1-2* if the UE is configured with
higher layer parameter *resourceAllocationType1GranularityDCI-1-2*, and
*P=1* otherwise*.* The resource indication value is defined by

if then

else

where≥ 1 and shall not exceed .

#### 5.1.2.3 Physical resource block (PRB) bundling

The PRB bundling procedures for PDSCH scheduled by PDCCH with DCI format
1\_1 described in this clause equally apply to PDSCH scheduled by PDCCH
with DCI format 1\_2, by applying the parameters of
*prb-BundlingTypeDCI-1-2* instead of *prb-BundlingType* as well as
*vrb-ToPRB-InterleaverDCI-1-2* instead of *vrb-ToPRB-Interleaver*.

A UE may assume that precoding granularity is consecutive resource
blocks in the frequency domain. can be equal to one of the values among
{2, 4, wideband}.

If is determined as \"wideband\", the UE is not expected to be scheduled
with non-contiguous PRBs and the UE may assume that the same precoding
is applied to the allocated resource associated with a same TCI state or
a same QCL assumption.

If is determined as one of the values among {2, 4}, Precoding Resource
Block Group (PRGs) partitions the bandwidth part *i* with consecutive
PRBs. Actual number of consecutive PRBs in each PRG could be one or
more.

The first PRG size is given by and the last PRG size given by if , and
the last PRG size is if .

The UE may assume the same precoding is applied for any downlink
contiguous allocation of PRBs in a PRG.

For PDSCH carrying SIB1 scheduled by PDCCH with CRC scrambled by
SI-RNTI, a PRG is partitioned from the lowest numbered resource block of
CORESET 0 if the corresponding PDCCH is associated with CORESET 0 and
Type0-PDCCH common search space and is addressed to SI-RNTI; otherwise,
a PRG is partitioned from common resource block 0.

If a UE is scheduled a PDSCH with DCI format 1\_0, the UE shall assume
that is equal to 2 PRBs.

When receiving PDSCH scheduled by PDCCH with DCI format 1\_1 with CRC
scrambled by C-RNTI, MCS-C-RNTI, or CS-RNTI, for bandwidth part is equal
to 2 PRBs unless configured by the higher layer parameter
*prb-BundlingType* given by *PDSCH-Config*.

When receiving PDSCH scheduled by PDCCH with DCI format 1\_1 with CRC
scrambled by C-RNTI, MCS-C-RNTI, or CS-RNTI, if the higher layer
parameter *prb-BundlingType* is set to \'dynamicBundling\', the higher
layer parameters *bundleSizeSet1* and *bundleSizeSet2* configure two
sets of values, the first set can take one or two values among {2, 4,
wideband}, and the second set can take one value among {2, 4, wideband}.

If the *PRB \'bundling size indicator\'* signalled in DCI format 1\_1 as
defined in Clause 7.3.1.2.2 of \[5, TS 38.212\]

\- is set to \'0\', the UE shall use the value from the second set of
values when receiving PDSCH scheduled by the same DCI.

\- is set to \'1\' and one value is configured for the first set of
values, the UE shall use this value when receiving PDSCH scheduled by
the same DCI

\- is set to \'1\' and two values are configured for the first set of
values as \'n2-wideband\' (corresponding to two values 2 and wideband)
or \'n4-wideband\' (corresponding to two values 4 and wideband), the UE
shall use the value when receiving PDSCH scheduled by the same DCI as
follows:

\- If the scheduled PRBs are contiguous and the size of the scheduled
PRBs is larger than , is the same as the scheduled bandwidth, otherwise
is set to the remaining configured value of 2 or 4, respectively.

When receiving PDSCH scheduled by PDCCH with DCI format 1\_1 with CRC
scrambled by C-RNTI, MCS-C-RNTI, or CS-RNTI, if the higher layer
parameter *prb-BundlingType* is set to \'staticBundling\', the value is
configured with the single value indicated by the higher layer parameter
*bundleSize*.

When a UE is configured with nominal RBG size $P = 2$ for bandwidth part
*i* according to Clause 5.1.2.2.1, or when a UE is configured with
interleaving unit of 2 for VRB to PRB mapping provided by the higher
layer parameter *vrb-ToPRB-Interleaver* given by *PDSCH-Config* for
bandwidth part *i*, the UE is not expected to be configured with = 4.

For a UE configured by the higher layer parameter *repetitionScheme* set
to \'fdmSchemeA*\' or* \'fdmSchemeB*\', and* when the UE is indicated
with two TCI states in a codepoint of the DCI field *\'Transmission

the DCI field \'*Antenna Port(s)*\',

\- If is determined as \"wideband\", the first
$\left\lceil \frac{n_{\text{PRB}}}{2} \right\rceil$ PRBs are assigned to
the first TCI state and the remaining
$\left\lfloor \frac{n_{\text{PRB}}}{2} \right\rfloor$ PRBs are assigned
to the second TCI state, where $n_{\text{PRB}}\ $is the total number of
allocated PRBs for the UE.

\- If is determined as one of the values among {2, 4}, even PRGs within
the allocated frequency domain resources are assigned to the first TCI
state and odd PRGs within the allocated frequency domain resources are
assigned to the second TCI state, wherein the PRGs are numbered
continuously in increasing order with the first PRG index equal to 0.

\- The UE is not expected to receive more than two PDSCH transmission
layers for each PDSCH transmission occasion.

For a UE configured by the higher layer parameter *repetitionScheme* set
to \'fdmSchemeB*\',* and when the UE is indicated with two TCI states in
a codepoint of the DCI field *\'Transmission Configuration Indication\'*
and DM-RS port(s) within one CDM group in the DCI field \'*Antenna
Port(s)\',* each PDSCH transmission occasion shall follow the Clause
7.3.1 of \[4, TS 38.211\] with the mapping to resource elements
determined by the assigned PRBs for corresponding TCI state of the PDSCH
transmission occasion, and the UE shall only expect at most two code
blocks per PDSCH transmission occasion when a single transmission layer
is scheduled and a single code block per PDSCH transmission occasion
when two transmission layers are scheduled. For two PDSCH transmission
occasions, the redundancy version to be applied is derived according to
Table 5.1.2.1-2, where $n = 0,\ 1$ are applied to the first and second
TCI state, respectively.

### 5.1.3 Modulation order, target code rate, redundancy version and transport block size determination

To determine the modulation order, target code rate, and transport block
size(s) in the physical downlink shared channel, the UE shall first

\- read the 5-bit modulation and coding scheme field (*I~MCS~*) in the
DCI to determine the modulation order (*Q~m~*) and target code rate
(*R*) based on the procedure defined in Clause 5.1.3.1, and

\- read \'*redundancy version\'* field (*rv*) in the DCI to determine
the redundancy version.

and second

\- the UE shall use the number of layers (ʋ), the total number of
allocated PRBs before rate matching (*n~PRB~*) to determine to the
transport block size based on the procedure defined in Clause 5.1.3.2.

The UE may skip decoding a transport block in an initial transmission if
the effective channel code rate is higher than 0.95, where the effective
channel code rate is defined as the number of downlink information bits
(including CRC bits) divided by the number of physical channel bits on
PDSCH.

The UE is not expected to handle any transport blocks (TBs) in a 14
consecutive-symbol duration for normal CP (or 12 for extended CP) ending
at the last symbol of the latest PDSCH transmission within an active BWP
on a serving cell whenever

$$2^{max(0,\mu - \mu^{'})}.\sum_{i \in S}^{}{\left\lfloor \frac{C_{i}^{'}}{L_{i}} \right\rfloor x_{i}.F_{i}} > \left\lceil \frac{X}{4} \right\rceil.\frac{1}{R_{\text{LBRM}}}.\text{TB}S_{\text{LBRM}}$$

based on the values defined in Clause 5.4.2.1 \[5, TS 38.212\]

\- $k_{0,i}^{j}$ is the starting location of RV for the $j$th
transmission

\- $E_{\text{i\ }}^{j} = \min{(E_{r})\ }$*of the scheduled code* blocks
for the $j\text{th}$ transmission

\- $N_{cb,i}$ is the circular buffer length

\- $J - 1$ is the current (re)transmission for the *i*th TB

\- $\mu^{'}$ corresponds to the subcarrier spacing of the BWP (across
all configured BWPs of a carrier) that has the largest configured number
of PRBs

\- in case there is more than one BWP corresponding to the largest
configured number of PRBs, *µ\'* follows the BWP with the largest
subcarrier spacing.

\- $\mu$ corresponds to the subcarrier spacing of the active BWP

\- R~LBRM~ = 2/3 as defined in Clause 5.4.2.1 \[5, TS 38.212\]

> \- TBS~LBRM~ as defined in Clause 5.4.2.1 \[5, TS 38.212\]

\- X as defined for downlink in Clause 5.4.2.1 \[5, TS 38.212\].

If the UE skips decoding, the physical layer indicates to higher layer
that the transport block is not successfully decoded.

Within a cell group, a UE is not required to handle PDSCH(s)
transmissions in slot *s~j~* in serving cell-*j*, and for *j* = 0,1,2..
*J-1*, slot *s~j~* overlapping with any given point in time, if the
following condition is not satisfied at that point in time:

where,

\- *J* is the number of configured serving cells belonging to a
frequency range

*- M* is the number of TB(s) transmitted in slot *s~j~*. If there are
two PDSCH transmission occasions of the same TB (in time domain or in
frequency domain) in the slot *s~j~*, each transmission occasion is
counted separately.

*- T~slot~^μ(j)^* =10^-3^/2*^μ(j)^*, where *μ(j)* is the numerology for
PDSCH(s) in slot *s~j~* of the *j*-th serving cell.

\- $\text{DataRate}$ \[Mbps\] is computed as the maximum data rate
summed over all the carriers in the frequency range for any signaled
band combination and feature set consistent with the configured servings
cells, where the data rate value is given by the formula in Clause 4.1.2
in \[13, TS 38.306\], including the scaling factor *f(i).*

For a *j-*th serving cell, if higher layer parameter
*processingType2Enabled* of *PDSCH-ServingCellConfig* is configured for
the serving cell and set to \'*enable\',* or if at least one *I~MCS~ \>*
*W* for a PDSCH, where *W* = 28 for MCS tables 5.1.3.1-1 and 5.1.3.1-3,
and *W* = 27 for MCS table 5.1.3.1-2, the UE is not required to handle
PDSCH transmissions, if the following condition is not satisfied:

$$\frac{\sum_{m = 0}^{M - 1}V_{j,m}}{L \times T_{s}^{\mu}} \leq \text{DataRateCC}$$

*where*

\- $\text{L\ }$is the number of symbols assigned to the PDSCH. For a
PDSCH that consists of two PDSCH transmission occasions in time domain
in one slot, $L$ is the number of symbols of one transmission occasion.

\- M is the number of TB(s) in the PDSCH

\-
$T_{s}^{\mu} = \frac{10^{- 3}}{{2^{\mu} \bullet N}_{\text{symb}}^{\text{slot}}}$

#### 5.1.3.2 Transport block size determination

In case the higher layer parameter *maxNrofCodeWordsScheduledByDCI*
indicates that two codeword transmission is enabled, then one of the two
transport blocks is disabled by DCI format 1\_1 if *I~MCS\ ~*= 26 and if
*rv~id~* = 1 for the corresponding transport block. If both transport
blocks are enabled, transport block 1 and 2 are mapped to codeword 0 and
1 respectively. If only one transport block is enabled, then the enabled
transport block is always mapped to the first codeword.

For the PDSCH assigned by a PDCCH with DCI format 1\_0, format 1\_1 or
format 1\_2 with CRC scrambled by C-RNTI, MCS-C-RNTI, TC-RNTI, CS-RNTI,
or SI-RNTI, if Table 5.1.3.1-2 is used and
$0\  \leq \ I_{\text{MCS\ }} \leq 27$*,* or a table other than Table
5.1.3.1-2 is used and $0\  \leq \ I_{\text{MCS\ }} \leq 28$*,* the UE
shall, except if the transport block is disabled in DCI format 1\_1,
first determine the TBS as specified below:

1\) The UE shall first determine the number of REs (*N~RE~*)
$N_{\text{RE}})$within the slot.

\- A UE first determines the number of REs allocated for PDSCH within a
PRB () by , where is the number of subcarriers in a physical resource
block, $N_{\text{symb}}^{\text{slot}}$ is the number of symbols of the
PDSCH allocation within the slot, $N_{\text{DMRS}}^{\text{PRB}}$ is the
number of REs for DM-RS per PRB in the scheduled duration including the
overhead of the DM-RS CDM groups without data, as indicated by DCI
format 1\_1 or format 1\_2 or as described for format 1\_0 in Clause
5.1.6.2, and $N_{\text{oh}}^{\text{PRB}}$is the overhead configured by
higher layer parameter *xOverhead in PDSCH-ServingCellConfig*. If the
*xOverhead* in *PDSCH-ServingCellconfig* is not configured (a value from
6, 12, or 18), the is set to 0. If the PDSCH is scheduled by PDCCH with
a CRC scrambled by SI-RNTI, RA-RNTI, MSGB-RNTI or P-RNTI, is assumed to
be 0.

\- A UE determines the total number of REs allocated for PDSCH
()$N_{\text{RE}})$ by
$N_{\text{RE}} = \ {\overline{N}}_{\text{RE}}^{'}*\ n_{\text{PRB}}$,
where *n~PRB~* is the total number of allocated PRBs for the UE.

2\) Unquantized intermediate variable (*N~info~*)
$\text{TBS}_{\text{temp}})\ $is obtained by
$\text{TBS}_{\text{temp}} = \ N_{\text{RE}}*R*Q_{m}*ʋ$.

If

Use step 3 as the next step of the TBS determination

else

Use step 4 as the next step of the TBS determination

end if

The UE is not expected to receive a PDSCH assigned by a PDCCH with CRC
scrambled by SI-RNTI with a TBS exceeding 2976 bits.

For a UE configured with the higher layer parameter *repetitionScheme*
set to \'fdmSchemeB\' and indicated with two TCI states in a codepoint
of the DCI field *\'Transmission Configuration Indication\'* and DM-RS
port(s) within one CDM group in the DCI field \'*Antenna Port(s)*\', the
TBS determination follows the steps 1-4 with the following modification
in step 1: a UE determines the total number of REs allocated for PDSCH
()$N_{\text{RE}})$ by
$N_{\text{RE}} = \ {\overline{N}}_{\text{RE}}^{'}*\ n_{\text{PRB}}$,
where *n~PRB~* is the total number of allocated PRBs corresponding to
the first TCI state, and the determined TBS of PDSCH transmission
occasion associated with the first TCI state is also applied to the
PDSCH transmission occasion associated with the second TCI state. For a
UE configured with the higher layer parameter *repetitionScheme* set to
\'tdmSchemeA\' and indicated with two TCI states in a codepoint of the
DCI field *\'Transmission Configuration Indication\'* and DM-RS port(s)
within one CDM group in the DCI field \'*Antenna Port(s)*\', the TBS
determination follows the steps 1-4 with the following modification in
step 1: a UE determines the number of REs allocated for PDSCH within a
PRB () by , where  is the number of symbols of the PDSCH allocation
within the slot corresponding to the first TCI state, and the determined
TBS of PDSCH transmission occasion associated with the first TCI state
is also applied to the PDSCH transmission occasion associated with the
second TCI state.

For the PDSCH assigned by a PDCCH with DCI format 1\_0 with CRC
scrambled by P-RNTI, or RA-RNTI, MsgB-RNTI, TBS determination follows
the steps 1-4 with the following modification in step 2: a scaling is
applied in the calculation of *N~info~*, where the scaling factor is
determined based on the *TB scaling* field in the DCI as in Table
5.1.3.2-2.

The NDI and HARQ process ID, as signalled on PDCCH, and the TBS, as
determined above, shall be reported to higher layers.

### 5.1.4 PDSCH resource mapping

When receiving the PDSCH scheduled with SI-RNTI and the system
information indicator in DCI is set to 0, the UE shall assume that no
SS/PBCH block is transmitted in REs used by the UE for a reception of
the PDSCH.

When receiving the PDSCH scheduled with SI-RNTI and the system
information indicator in DCI is set to 1, RA-RNTI, MSGB-RNTI, P-RNTI or
TC-RNTI, the UE assumes SS/PBCH block transmission according to
*ssb-PositionsInBurst*, and if the PDSCH resource allocation overlaps
with PRBs containing SS/PBCH block transmission resources the UE shall
assume that the PRBs containing SS/PBCH block transmission resources are
not available for PDSCH in the OFDM symbols where SS/PBCH block is
transmitted.

A UE expects a configuration provided by *ssb-PositionsInBurst* in
*ServingCellConfigCommon* to be same as a configuration provided by
*ssb-PositionsInBurst* in *SIB1*.

When receiving PDSCH scheduled by PDCCH with CRC scrambled by C-RNTI,
MCS-C-RNTI, CS-RNTI, or PDSCHs with SPS, the REs corresponding to the
configured or dynamically indicated resources in Clauses 5.1.4.1,
5.1.4.2 are not available for PDSCH. Furthermore, the UE assumes SS/PBCH
block transmission according to *ssb-PositionsInBurst* if the PDSCH
resource allocation overlaps with PRBs containing SS/PBCH block
transmission resources, the UE shall assume that the PRBs containing
SS/PBCH block transmission resources are not available for PDSCH in the
OFDM symbols where SS/PBCH block is transmitted.

A UE is not expected to handle the case where PDSCH DM-RS REs are
overlapping, even partially, with any RE(s) not available for PDSCH*.*

For operation with shared spectrum channel access, SS/PBCH block
transmission according to *ssb-PositionsInBurst* represents all of the
candidate SS/PBCH blocks corresponding to SS/PBCH block indices provided
by *ssb-PositionsInBurst* as described in Clause 4.1 of \[6, TS
38.213\].

#### 5.1.4.1 PDSCH resource mapping with RB symbol level granularity

The procedures for PDSCH scheduled by PDCCH with DCI format 1\_1
described in this clause equally apply to PDSCH scheduled by PDCCH with
DCI format 1\_2, by applying the parameters of
*rateMatchPatternGroup1DCI-1-2*, *rateMatchPatternGroup2DCI-1-2* instead
of *rateMatchPatternGroup1* and *rateMatchPatternGroup2*.

A UE may be configured with any of the following higher layer parameters
indicating REs declared as not available for PDSCH:

\- *rateMatchPatternToAddModList* given by *PDSCH-Config,* by
*ServingCellConfig* or by *ServingCellConfigCommon* and configuring up
to 4 *RateMatchPattern(s)* per BWP and up to 4 *RateMatchPattern(s)* per
serving-cell. A *RateMatchPattern* may contain:

\- within a BWP, when provided by *PDSCH-Config* or within a serving
cell when provided by *ServingCellConfig* or *ServingCellConfigCommon*,
a pair of reserved resources with numerology provided by higher layer
parameter *subcarrierSpacing* given by *RateMatchPattern* when
configured per serving cell or by numerology of associated BWP when
configured per BWP. The pair of reserved resources are respectively
indicated by an RB level bitmap (higher layer parameter *resourceBlocks*
given by *RateMatchPattern*) with 1RB granularity and a symbol level
bitmap spanning one or two slots (higher layer parameters
*symbolsInResourceBlock* given by *RateMatchPattern*) for which the
reserved RBs apply. A bit value equal to 1 in the RB and symbol level
bitmaps indicates that the corresponding resource is not available for
PDSCH. For each pair of RB and symbol level bitmaps, a UE may be
configured with a time-domain pattern (higher layer parameter
*periodicityAndPattern* given by *RateMatchPattern*), where each bit of
*periodicityAndPattern* corresponds to a unit equal to a duration of the
symbol level bitmap, and a bit value equal to 1 indicates that the pair
is present in the unit. The *periodicityAndPattern* can be {1, 2, 4, 5,
8, 10, 20 or 40} units long, but maximum of 40 msec. The first symbol of
*periodicityAndPattern* every 40 msec/P periods is a first symbol in
frame $n_{f}$ mod 4 = 0, where P is the duration of
*periodicityAndPattern* in units of msec. When *periodicityAndPattern*
is not configured for a pair, for a symbol level bitmap spanning two
slots, the bits of the first and second slots correspond respectively to
even and odd slots of a radio frame, and for a symbol level bitmap
spanning one slot, the bits of the slot correspond to every slot of a
radio frame. The pair can be included in one or two groups of resource
sets (higher layer parameters *rateMatchPatternGroup1* and
*rateMatchPatternGroup2*). The *rateMatchPatternToAddModList* given by
*ServingCellConfig* or *ServingCellConfigCommon* configuration in
numerology *µ* applies only to PDSCH of the same numerology *µ*.

\- within a BWP, a frequency domain resource of a CORESET configured by
*ControlResourceSet* with *controlResourceSetId* or
*ControlResourceSetZero* and time domain resource determined by the
higher layer parameters *monitoringSlotPeriodicityAndOffset,* *duration*
and *monitoringSymbolsWithinSlot* of all search-space-sets configured by
*SearchSpace* and time domain resource of search-space-set zero
configured by *searchSpaceZero* associated with the CORESET as well as
CORESET duration configured by *ControlResourceSet* with
*controlResourceSetId* or *ControlResourceSetZero.* This resource not
available for PDSCH can be included in one or two groups of resource
sets (higher layer parameters *rateMatchPatternGroup1* and
*rateMatchPatternGroup2*).

A configured group *rateMatchPatternGroup1* or *rateMatchPatternGroup2*
contains a list of indices of *RateMatchPattern(s)* forming a union of
resource-sets not available for a PDSCH dynamically if a corresponding
bit of the \'*Rate matching indicator*\' field of the DCI format 1\_1
scheduling the PDSCH is equal to 1. The REs corresponding to the union
of resource-sets configured by *RateMatchPattern(s)* that are not
included in either of the two groups are not available for a PDSCH
scheduled by a DCI format 1\_0, a PDSCH scheduled by a DCI format 1\_1,
and PDSCHs with SPS. When receiving a PDSCH scheduled by a DCI format
1\_0 or PDSCHs with SPS activated by a DCI format 1\_0, the REs
corresponding to configured resources in *rateMatchPatternGroup1* or
*rateMatchPatternGroup2* are not available for the scheduled PDSCH or
the activated PDSCHs with SPS. When receiving PDSCHs with SPS activated
by a DCI format 1\_1, the REs corresponding to configured resources in
*rateMatchPatternGroup1* or *rateMatchPatternGroup2* are not available
for the PDSCHs with SPS if a corresponding bit of the Rate matching
indicator field of the DCI format 1\_1 activating the PDSCHs with SPS is
equal to 1.

For a bitmap pair included in one or two groups of resource sets, the
dynamic indication of availability for PDSCH applies to a set of slot(s)
where the *rateMatchPatternToAddModList* is present among the slots of
scheduled PDSCH.

If a UE monitors PDCCH candidates of aggregation levels 8 and 16 with
the same starting CCE index in non-interleaved CORESET spanning one OFDM
symbol and if a detected PDCCH scheduling the PDSCH has aggregation
level 8, the resources corresponding to the aggregation level 16 PDCCH
candidate are not available for the PDSCH.

If a PDSCH scheduled by a PDCCH would overlap with resources in the
CORESET containing the PDCCH, the resources corresponding to a union of
the detected PDCCH that scheduled the PDSCH and associated PDCCH DM-RS
are not available for the PDSCH. When *precoderGranularity* configured
in a CORESET where the PDCCH was detected is set to
\'*allContiguousRBs\'*, the associated PDCCH DM-RS are DM-RS in all REGs
of the CORESET. Otherwise, the associated DM-RS are the DM-RS in REGs of
the PDCCH.

#### 5.1.4.2 PDSCH resource mapping with RE level granularity

The procedures for PDSCH scheduled by PDCCH with DCI format 1\_1
described in this clause equally apply to PDSCH scheduled by PDCCH with
DCI format 1\_2, by applying the parameters of
*aperiodicZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSetsToAddModListDCI-1-2* instead of
*aperiodic-ZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSetsToAddModList*.

A UE may be configured with any of the following higher layer
parameters:

*-* REs indicated by the \'*RateMatchPatternLTE-CRS\'* in
*lte-CRS-ToMatchAround* in *ServingCellConfig* or
*ServingCellConfigCommon* configuring cell-specific RS, in 15 kHz
subcarrier spacing applicable only to 15 kHz subcarrier spacing PDSCH,
of one LTE carrier in a serving cell are declared as not available for
PDSCH.

*-* REs indicated by *\'RateMatchPatternLTE-CRS\'* in
*lte-CRS-PatternList1-r16* in *ServingCellConfig* configuring
cell-specific RS, in 15 kHz subcarrier spacing applicable only to 15 kHz
subcarrier spacing PDSCH, of one LTE carrier in a serving cell are
declared as not available for PDSCH.

\- Each *RateMatchPatternLTE-CRS* configuration contains *v-Shift*
consisting of LTE-CRS-vshift(s), *nrofCRS-Ports* consisting of LTE-CRS
antenna ports 1, 2 or 4 ports, *carrierFreqDL* representing the offset
in units of 15 kHz subcarriers from (reference) point A to the LTE
carrier centre subcarrier location, *carrierBandwidthDL* representing
the LTE carrier bandwidth, and may also configure
*mbsfn-SubframeConfigList* representing MBSFN subframe configuration. A
UE determines the CRS position within the slot according to Clause
6.10.1.2 in \[15, TS 36.211\], where slot corresponds to LTE subframe.

\- If the UE is configured by higher layer parameter *PDCCH-Config* with
two different values of *coresetPoolIndex* in *ControlResourceSet* and
is also configured by the higher layer parameter
*lte-CRS-PatternList1-r16* and *lte-CRS-PatternList2-r16* in
*ServingCellConfig*, the following REs are declared as not available for
PDSCH:

\- if the UE is configured with *crs-RateMatch-PerCoresetPoolIndex*, REs
indicated by the CRS pattern(s) in *lte-CRS-PatternList1-r16* if the
PDSCH is associated with *coresetPoolIndex* set to \'0\', or the CRS
pattern(s) in *lte-CRS-PatternList2-r16* if PDSCH is associated with
*coresetPoolIndex* set to \'1\';

\- otherwise, REs indicated by *lte-CRS-PatternList1-r16* and
*lte-CRS-PatternList2-r16,* in *ServingCellConfig*.

\- Within a BWP, the UE can be configured with one or more ZP CSI-RS
resource set configuration(s) for aperiodic, semi-persistent and
periodic time-domain behaviours (higher layer parameters
*aperiodic-ZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSetsToAddModList,*
*sp-ZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSetsToAddModList* and *p-ZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet*
respectively comprised in *PDSCH-Config*), with each ZP CSI-RS resource
set consisting of at most 16 ZP CSI-RS resources (higher layer parameter
*ZP-CSI-RS-Resource*) in numerology of the BWP. The REs indicated by
*p-ZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet* are declared as not available for PDSCH. The
REs indicated by *sp-ZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSetsToAddModList* and
aperiodic-ZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSetsToAddModList are declared as not
available for PDSCH when their triggering and activation are applied,
respectively. The following parameters are configured via higher layer
signaling for each ZP CSI-RS resource configuration:

\- *zp-CSI-RS-ResourceId* in *ZP-CSI-RS-Resource* determines ZP CSI-RS
resource configuration identity.

\- *nrofPorts* in *CSI-RS-ResourceMapping* defines the number of CSI-RS
ports, where the allowable values are given in Clause 7.4.1.5 of \[4, TS
38.211\].

\- *cdm-Type* in *CSI-RS-ResourceMapping* *defines CDM values and
pattern, where the allowable values are given in Clause 7.4.1.5 of \[4,
TS 38.211\].*

*- resourceMapping in ZP-CSI-RS-Resource defines t*he OFDM symbol and
subcarrier occupancy of the ZP CSI-RS resource within a slot that are
given in Clause 7.4.1.5 of \[4, TS 38.211\].

*- periodicityAndOffset in* *ZP-CSI-RS-Resource defines the ZP-CSI-RS
periodicity and slot offset for periodic/semi-persistent ZP CSI-RS.*

The UE may be configured with a DCI field for triggering the aperiodic
ZP CSI-RS. A list of *ZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet(s)*, provided by higher
layer parameter *aperiodic-ZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSetsToAddModList* in
*PDSCH-Config*, is configured for aperiodic triggering. The maximum
number of aperiodic *ZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet(s)* configured per BWP is 3.
The bit-length of DCI field *ZP CSI-RS trigger* depends on the number of
aperiodic *ZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet(s)*configured (up to 2 bits). Each
non-zero codepoint of \'*ZP CSI-RS\' trigger* in DCI format 1\_1
triggers one aperiodic \'*ZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet*\' in the list
*aperiodic-ZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSetsToAddModList* by indicating the
aperiodic ZP CSI-RS resource set ID. The DCI codepoint \'01\' triggers
the resource set with \'ZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSetId\' set to \'1\', the DCI
codepoint \'10\' triggers the resource set with
\'ZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSetId\' set to \'2\', and the DCI codepoint \'11\'
triggers the resource set with \'ZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSetId\' set to \'3\'.
Codepoint \'00\' is reserved for not triggering aperiodic ZP CSI-RS.
When receiving PDSCH scheduled by DCI format 1\_0 or PDSCHs with SPS
activated by DCI format 1\_0, the REs corresponding to configured
resources in *aperiodic-ZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSetsToAddModList* or in
*aperiodicZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSetsToAddModListDCI-1-2* are available for
PDSCH.

When the UE is configured with multi-slot and single-slot PDSCH
scheduling, the triggered aperiodic ZP CSI-RS is applied to all the
slot(s) of the PDSCH scheduled or the PDSCHs with SPS activated by the
PDCCH containing the trigger.

For a UE configured with a list of semi-persistent
*ZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet(s)* provided by higher layer parameter
*sp-ZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSetsToAddModList*:

\- when the UE would transmit a PUCCH with HARQ-ACK information in slot
*n* corresponding to the PDSCH carrying the activation command, as
described in clause 6.1.3.19 of \[10, TS 38.321\], for ZP CSI-RS
resource(s), the corresponding action in \[10, TS 38.321\] and the UE
assumption on the PDSCH RE mapping corresponding to the activated ZP
CSI-RS resource(s) shall be applied starting from the first slot that is
after slot $n + {3N}_{\text{slot}}^{subframe,µ}$ where *μ* is the SCS
configuration for the PUCCH.

\- when the UE would transmit a PUCCH with HARQ-ACK information in slot
*n* corresponding to the PDSCH carrying the deactivation command, as
described in clause 6.1.3.19 of \[10, TS 38.321\], for activated ZP
CSI-RS resource(s), the corresponding action in \[10, TS 38.321\] and
the UE assumption on cessation of the PDSCH RE mapping corresponding to
the de-activated ZP CSI-RS resource(s) shall be applied starting from
the first slot that is after slot $n + {3N}_{\text{slot}}^{subframe,µ}$
where *μ* is the SCS configuration for the PUCCH.

### 5.1.5 Antenna ports quasi co-location

The UE can be configured with a list of up to *M* *TCI-State*
configurations within the higher layer parameter *PDSCH-Config* to
decode PDSCH according to a detected PDCCH with DCI intended for the UE
and the given serving cell, where M depends on the UE capability
*maxNumberConfiguredTCIstatesPerCC*. Each *TCI-State* contains
parameters for configuring a quasi co-location relationship between one
or two downlink reference signals and the DM-RS ports of the PDSCH, the
DM-RS port of PDCCH or the CSI-RS port(s) of a CSI-RS resource. The
quasi co-location relationship is configured by the higher layer
parameter *qcl-Type1* for the first DL RS, and *qcl-Type2* for the
second DL RS (if configured). For the case of two DL RSs, the QCL types
shall not be the same, regardless of whether the references are to the
same DL RS or different DL RSs. The quasi co-location types
corresponding to each DL RS are given by the higher layer parameter
*qcl-Type* in *QCL-Info* and may take one of the following values:

\- \'typeA\': {Doppler shift, Doppler spread, average delay, delay
spread}

\- \'typeB\': {Doppler shift, Doppler spread}

\- \'typeC\': {Doppler shift, average delay}

\- \'typeD\': {Spatial Rx parameter}

The UE receives an activation command, as described in clause 6.1.3.14
of \[10, TS 38.321\], used to map up to 8 TCI states to the codepoints
of the DCI field *\'Transmission Configuration Indication\'* in one
CC/DL BWP or in a set of CCs/DL BWPs, respectively. When a set of TCI
state IDs are activated for a set of CCs/DL BWPs, where the applicable
list of CCs is determined by indicated CC in the activation command, the
same set of TCI state IDs are applied for all DL BWPs in the indicated
CCs.

When a UE supports two TCI states in a codepoint of the DCI field
\'*Transmission Configuration Indication\'* the UE may receive an
activation command, as described in clause 6.1.3.24 of \[10, TS
38.321\], the activation command is used to map up to 8 combinations of
one or two TCI states to the codepoints of the DCI field *\'Transmission
Configuration Indication\'*. The UE is not expected to receive more than
8 TCI states in the activation command.

When the DCI field *\'Transmission Configuration Indication\'* is
present in DCI format 1\_2 and when the number of codepoints S in the
DCI field *\'Transmission Configuration Indication\'* of DCI format 1\_2
is smaller than the number of TCI codepoints that are activated by the
activation command, as described in clause 6.1.3.14 and 6.1.3.24 of
\[10, TS38.321\], only the first S activated codepoints are applied for
DCI format 1\_2.

When the UE would transmit a PUCCH with HARQ-ACK information in slot *n*
corresponding to the PDSCH carrying the activation command, the
indicated mapping between TCI states and codepoints of the DCI field
*\'Transmission Configuration Indication\'* should be applied starting
from the first slot that is after
slot$\ n + {3N}_{\text{slot}}^{subframe,µ}$ where *μ* is the SCS
configuration for the PUCCH. If *tci-PresentInDCI* is set to \'enabled\'
or *tci-PresentDCI-1-2* is configured for the CORESET scheduling the
PDSCH, and the time offset between the reception of the DL DCI and the
corresponding PDSCH is equal to or greater than *timeDurationForQCL* if
applicable, after a UE receives an initial higher layer configuration of
TCI states and before reception of the activation command, the UE may
assume that the DM-RS ports of PDSCH of a serving cell are quasi
co-located with the SS/PBCH block determined in the initial access
procedure with respect to *qcl-Type* set to \'typeA\', and when
applicable, also with respect to *qcl-Type* set to \'typeD\'.

If a UE is configured with the higher layer parameter *tci-PresentInDCI*
that is set as \'enabled\' for the CORESET scheduling the PDSCH, the UE
assumes that the TCI field is present in the DCI format 1\_1 of the
PDCCH transmitted on the CORESET. If a UE is configured with the higher
layer parameter *tci-PresentDCI-1-2* for the CORESET scheduling the
PDSCH, the UE assumes that the TCI field with a DCI field size indicated
by *tci-PresentDCI-1-2* is present in the DCI format 1\_2 of the PDCCH
transmitted on the CORESET. If the PDSCH is scheduled by a DCI format
not having the TCI field present, and the time offset between the
reception of the DL DCI and the corresponding PDSCH of a serving cell is
equal to or greater than a threshold *timeDurationForQCL* if applicable,
where the threshold is based on reported UE capability \[13, TS
38.306\], for determining PDSCH antenna port quasi co-location, the UE
assumes that the TCI state or the QCL assumption for the PDSCH is
identical to the TCI state or QCL assumption whichever is applied for
the CORESET used for the PDCCH transmission within the active BWP of the
serving cell.

If the PDSCH is scheduled by a DCI format having the TCI field present,
the TCI field in DCI in the scheduling component carrier points to the
activated TCI states in the scheduled component carrier or DL BWP, the
UE shall use the *TCI-State* according to the value of the
\'*Transmission Configuration Indication*\' field in the detected PDCCH
with DCI for determining PDSCH antenna port quasi co-location. The UE
may assume that the DM-RS ports of PDSCH of a serving cell are quasi
co-located with the RS(s) in the TCI state with respect to the QCL type
parameter(s) given by the indicated TCI state if the time offset between
the reception of the DL DCI and the corresponding PDSCH is equal to or
greater than a threshold *timeDurationForQCL*, where the threshold is
based on reported UE capability \[13, TS 38.306\]. For a single slot
PDSCH, the indicated TCI state(s) should be based on the activated TCI
states in the slot with the scheduled PDSCH. For a multi-slot PDSCH, the
indicated TCI state(s) should be based on the activated TCI states in
the first slot with the scheduled PDSCH, and UE shall expect the
activated TCI states are the same across the slots with the scheduled
PDSCH. When the UE is configured with CORESET associated with a search
space set for cross-carrier scheduling and the UE is not configured with
*enableDefaultBeamForCCS*, the UE expects *tci-PresentInDCI* is set as
\'enabled\' or *tci-PresentDCI-1-2* is configured for the CORESET, and
if one or more of the TCI states configured for the serving cell
scheduled by the search space set contains *qcl-Type* set to \'typeD\',
the UE expects the time offset between the reception of the detected
PDCCH in the search space set and the corresponding PDSCH is larger than
or equal to the threshold *timeDurationForQCL.*

Independent of the configuration of *tci-PresentInDCI* and
*tci-PresentDCI-1-2* in RRC connected mode, if the offset between the
reception of the DL DCI and the corresponding PDSCH is less than the
threshold *timeDurationForQCL* and at least one configured TCI state for
the serving cell of scheduled PDSCH contains *qcl-Type* set to
\'typeD\',

\- the UE may assume that the DM-RS ports of PDSCH(s) of a serving cell
are quasi co-located with the RS(s) with respect to the QCL parameter(s)
used for PDCCH quasi co-location indication of the CORESET associated
with a monitored search space with the lowest *controlResourceSetId* in
the latest slot in which one or more CORESETs within the active BWP of
the serving cell are monitored by the UE. In this case, if the
*qcl-Type* is set to \'typeD\' of the PDSCH DM-RS is different from that
of the PDCCH DM-RS with which they overlap in at least one symbol, the
UE is expected to prioritize the reception of PDCCH associated with that
CORESET. This also applies to the intra-band CA case (when PDSCH and the
CORESET are in different component carriers).

\- If a UE is configured with
*enableDefaultTCI-StatePerCoresetPoolIndex* and the UE is configured by
higher layer parameter *PDCCH-Config* that contains two different values
of *coresetPoolIndex* in different *ControlResourceSets,*

\- the UE may assume that the DM-RS ports of PDSCH associated with a
value of *coresetPoolIndex* of a serving cell are quasi co-located with
the RS(s) with respect to the QCL parameter(s) used for PDCCH quasi
co-location indication of the CORESET associated with a monitored search
space with the lowest *controlResourceSetId* among CORESETs, which are
configured with the same value of *coresetPoolIndex* as the PDCCH
scheduling that PDSCH, in the latest slot in which one or more CORESETs
associated with the same value of *coresetPoolIndex* as the PDCCH
scheduling that PDSCH within the active BWP of the serving cell are
monitored by the UE. In this case, if the \'QCL-TypeD\' of the PDSCH
DM-RS is different from that of the PDCCH DM-RS with which they overlap
in at least one symbol and they are associated with same value of
*coresetPoolIndex*, the UE is expected to prioritize the reception of
PDCCH associated with that CORESET. This also applies to the intra-band
CA case (when PDSCH and the CORESET are in different component
carriers).

\- If a UE is configured with *enableTwoDefaultTCI-States*, and at least
one TCI codepoint indicates two TCI states, the UE may assume that the
DM-RS ports of PDSCH or PDSCH transmission occasions of a serving cell
are quasi co-located with the RS(s) with respect to the QCL parameter(s)
associated with the TCI states corresponding to the lowest codepoint
among the TCI codepoints containing two different TCI states. When the
UE is configured by higher layer parameter *repetitionScheme* set to
\'tdmSchemeA\' or is configured with higher layer parameter
*repetitionNumber*, and the offset between the reception of the DL DCI
and the first PDSCH transmission occasion is less than the threshold
*timeDurationForQCL,* the mapping of the TCI states to PDSCH
transmission occasions is determined according to clause 5.1.2.1 by
replacing the indicated TCI states with the TCI states corresponding to
the lowest codepoint among the TCI codepoints containing two different
TCI states based on the activated TCI states in the slot with the first
PDSCH transmission occasion. In this case, if the \'QCL-TypeD\' in both
of the TCI states corresponding to the lowest codepoint among the TCI
codepoints containing two different TCI states is different from that of
the PDCCH DM-RS with which they overlap in at least one symbol, the UE
is expected to prioritize the reception of PDCCH associated with that
CORESET. This also applies to the intra-band CA case (when PDSCH and the
CORESET are in different component carriers)

\- In all cases above, if none of configured TCI states for the serving
cell of scheduled PDSCH is configured with *qcl-Type* set to \'typeD\',
the UE shall obtain the other QCL assumptions from the indicated TCI
state(s) for its scheduled PDSCH irrespective of the time offset between
the reception of the DL DCI and the corresponding PDSCH.

If the PDCCH carrying the scheduling DCI is received on one component
carrier, and the PDSCH scheduled by that DCI is on another component
carrier:

\- The *timeDurationForQCL* is determined based on the subcarrier
spacing of the scheduled PDSCH. If µ~PDCCH~ \< µ~PDSCH~ an additional
timing delay $d\frac{2^{\mu_{\text{PDSCH}}}}{2^{\mu_{\text{PDCCH}}}}$ is
added to the *timeDurationForQCL*, where *d* is defined in 5.2.1.5.1a-1,
otherwise *d* is zero;

\- When the UE is configured with *enableDefaultBeamForCCS*, if the
offset between the reception of the DL DCI and the corresponding PDSCH
is less than the threshold *timeDurationForQCL,* or if the DL DCI does
not have the TCI field present, the UE obtains its QCL assumption for
the scheduled PDSCH from the activated TCI state with the lowest ID
applicable to PDSCH in the active BWP of the scheduled cell.

For a periodic CSI-RS resource in an *NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet* configured
with higher layer parameter *trs-Info*, the UE shall expect that a
TCI-State indicates one of the following quasi co-location type(s):

\- \'typeC\' with an SS/PBCH block and, when applicable, \'typeD\' with
the same SS/PBCH block, or

\- \'typeC\' with an SS/PBCH block and, when applicable,\'typeD\' with a
CSI-RS resource in an *NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet* configured with higher
layer parameter *repetition*.

For an aperiodic CSI-RS resource in an *NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet*
configured with higher layer parameter *trs-Info,* the UE shall expect
that a *TCI-State* indicates *qcl-Type* set to \'typeA\' with a periodic
CSI-RS resource in a *NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet* configured with higher
layer parameter *trs-Info* and, when applicable, *qcl-Type* set to
\'typeD\' with the same periodic CSI-RS resource.

For a CSI-RS resource in an *NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet* configured without
higher layer parameter *trs-Info* and without the higher layer parameter
*repetition*, the UE shall expect that a *TCI-State* indicates one of
the following quasi co-location type(s):

\- \'typeA\' with a CSI-RS resource in a *NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet*
configured with higher layer parameter *trs-Info* and, when applicable,
\'typeD\' with the same CSI-RS resource, or

\- \'typeA\' with a CSI-RS resource in a *NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet*
configured with higher layer parameter *trs-Info* and, when applicable,
\'typeD\' with an SS/PBCH block, or

\- \'typeA\' with a CSI-RS resource in a *NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet*
configured with higher layer parameter *trs-Info* and, when applicable,
\'typeD\' with a CSI-RS resource in a *NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet*
configured with higher layer parameter *repetition*, or

\- \'typeB\' with a CSI-RS resource in a *NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet*
configured with higher layer parameter *trs-Info* when \'typeD\' is not
applicable.

For a CSI-RS resource in an *NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet* configured with
higher layer parameter *repetition,* the UE shall expect that a
*TCI-State* indicates one of the following quasi co-location type(s):

\- \'typeA\' with a CSI-RS resource in a *NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet*
configured with higher layer parameter *trs-Info* and, when applicable,
\'typeD\' with the same CSI-RS resource, or

\- \'typeA\' with a CSI-RS resource in a *NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet*
configured with higher layer parameter *trs-Info* and, when applicable,
\'typeD\' with a CSI-RS resource in a *NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet*
configured with higher layer parameter *repetition*, or

\- \'typeC\' with an SS/PBCH block and, when applicable, \'typeD\' with
the same SS/PBCH block.

For the DM-RS of PDCCH, the UE shall expect that a *TCI-State* indicates
one of the following quasi co-location type(s):

\- \'typeA\' with a CSI-RS resource in a *NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet*
configured with higher layer parameter *trs-Info* and, when applicable,

\- \'typeA\' with a CSI-RS resource in a *NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet*
configured with higher layer parameter *trs-Info* and, when applicable,

configured without higher layer parameter trs-Info and without higher
layer parameter *repetition* and, when applicable, \'typeD\' with the
same CSI-RS resource.

For the DM-RS of PDSCH, the UE shall expect that a *TCI-State* indicates
one of the following quasi co-location type(s):

\- \'typeA\' with a CSI-RS resource in a *NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet*
configured with higher layer parameter *trs-Info* and, when applicable,

configured with higher layer parameter *trs-Info* and, when applicable,
\'typeD\' with a CSI-RS resource in an *NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet*
configured with higher layer parameter *repetition*,or

\- typeA\' with a CSI-RS resource in a *NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet*
configured without higher layer parameter *trs-Info* and without higher

### 5.1.6 UE procedure for receiving reference signals

#### 5.1.6.1 CSI-RS reception procedure

The CSI-RS defined in Clause 7.4.1.5 of \[4, TS 38.211\], may be used
for time/frequency tracking, CSI computation, L1-RSRP computation,
L1-SINR computation and mobility.

For a CSI-RS resource associated with a *NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet* with
the higher layer parameter *repetition* set to \'on\', the UE shall not
expect to be configured with CSI-RS over the symbols during which the UE
is also configured to monitor the CORESET, while for other
*NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet* configurations, if the UE is configured with a
CSI-RS resource and a search space set associated with a CORESET in the
same OFDM symbol(s), the UE may assume that the CSI-RS and a PDCCH DM-RS
transmitted in all the search space sets associated with CORESET are
quasi co-located with \'typeD\', if \'typeD\' is applicable. This also
applies to the case when CSI-RS and the CORESET are in different
intra-band component carriers, if \'typeD\' is applicable. Furthermore,
the UE shall not expect to be configured with the CSI-RS in PRBs that
overlap those of the CORESET in the OFDM symbols occupied by the search
space set(s).

The UE is not expected to receive CSI-RS and *SIB1* message in the
overlapping PRBs in the OFDM symbols where *SIB1* is transmitted.

If the UE is configured with DRX,

\- if the UE is configured to monitor DCI format 2\_6 and configured by
higher layer parameter *ps-TransmitOtherPeriodicCSI* to report CSI with
the higher layer parameter *reportConfigType* set to \'periodic\' and
*reportQuantity* set to quantities other than \'cri-RSRP\' and
\'ssb-Index-RSRP\' when *drx-onDurationTimer* in *DRX-Config* is not
started, the most recent CSI measurement occasion occurs in DRX active
time or during the time duration indicated by *drx-onDurationTimer* in
*DRX-Config* also outside DRX active time for CSI to be reported;

\- if the UE is configured to monitor DCI format 2\_6 and configured by
higher layer parameter *ps-TransmitPeriodicL1-RSRP* to report L1-RSRP
with the higher layer parameter *reportConfigType* set to \'periodic\'
and *reportQuantity* set to cri-RSRP when *drx-onDurationTimer* in
*DRX-Config* is not started, the most recent CSI measurement occasion
occurs in DRX active time or during the time duration indicated by
*drx-onDurationTimer* in *DRX-Config* also outside DRX active time for
CSI to be reported;

\- otherwise, the most recent CSI measurement occasion occurs in DRX
active time for CSI to be reported.

##### 5.1.6.1.1 CSI-RS for tracking

A UE in RRC connected mode is expected to receive the higher layer UE
specific configuration of a *NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet* configured with
higher layer parameter *trs-Info*.

For a *NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet* configured with the higher layer
parameter *trs-Info*, the UE shall assume the antenna port with the same
port index of the configured NZP CSI-RS resources in the
*NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet* is the same.

\- For frequency range 1, the UE may be configured with one or more NZP
CSI-RS set(s), where a *NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet* consists of four
periodic NZP CSI-RS resources in two consecutive slots with two periodic
NZP CSI-RS resources in each slot. If no two consecutive slots are
indicated as downlink slots by *tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon* or
*tdd-UL-DL-ConfigDedicated*, then the UE may be configured with one or
more NZP CSI-RS set(s), where a *NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet* consists of two
periodic NZP CSI-RS resources in one slot.

\- For frequency range 2 the UE may be configured with one or more NZP
CSI-RS set(s), where a *NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet* consists of two periodic
CSI-RS resources in one slot or with a *NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet* of four
periodic NZP CSI-RS resources in two consecutive slots with two periodic
NZP CSI-RS resources in each slot.

A UE configured with *NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet(s)* configured with higher
layer parameter *trs-Info* may have the CSI-RS resources configured as:

\- Periodic, with the CSI-RS resources in the *NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet*
configured with same periodicity, bandwidth and subcarrier location.

\- Periodic CSI-RS resource in one set and aperiodic CSI-RS resources in
a second set, with the aperiodic CSI-RS and periodic CSI-RS resource
having the same bandwidth (with same RB location) and the aperiodic
CSI-RS being configured with *qcl-Type* set to \'typeA\' and \'typeD\',
where applicable, with the periodic CSI-RS resources. For frequency
range 2, the UE does not expect that the scheduling offset between the
last symbol of the PDCCH carrying the triggering DCI and the first
symbol of the aperiodic CSI-RS resources is smaller than
*beamSwitchTiming* + *d*
$\bullet 2^{\mu_{\text{CSIRS}}}/2^{\mu_{\text{PDCCH}}}$ *in CSI-RS
symbols,* where *beamSwitchTiming is* UE reported value defined in \[13,
TS 38.306\], the reported value is one of the values of {14, 28, 48},
and the beam switching timing delay *d* is defined in Table 5.2.1.5.1a-1
if µ~PDCCH~ \< µ~CSIRS~ , else *d* is zero. The UE shall expect that the
periodic CSI-RS resource set and aperiodic CSI-RS resource set are
configured with the same number of CSI-RS resources and with the same
number of CSI-RS resources in a slot. For the aperiodic CSI-RS resource
set if triggered, and if the associated periodic CSI-RS resource set is
configured with four periodic CSI-RS resources with two consecutive
slots with two periodic CSI-RS resources in each slot, the higher layer
parameter *aperiodicTriggeringOffset* indicates the triggering offset
for the first slot for the first two CSI-RS resources in the set.

A UE does not expect to be configured with a *CSI-ReportConfig* that is
linked to a *CSI-ResourceConfig* containing an *NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet*
configured with *trs-Info* and with the *CSI-ReportConfig* configured
with the higher layer parameter *timeRestrictionForChannelMeasurements*
set to \'configured\'.

A UE does not expect to be configured with a *CSI-ReportConfig* with the
higher layer parameter *reportQuantity* set to other than \'none\' for
aperiodic NZP CSI-RS resource set configured with *trs-Info.*

A UE does not expect to be configured with a *CSI-ReportConfig* for
periodic NZP CSI-RS resource set configured with *trs-Info*.

A UE does not expect to be configured with a *NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet*
configured both with *trs-Info* and *repetition*.

Each CSI-RS resource, defined in Clause 7.4.1.5.3 of \[4, TS 38.211\],
is configured by the higher layer parameter *NZP-CSI-RS-Resource* with
the following restrictions:

\- the time-domain locations of the two CSI-RS resources in a slot, or
of the four CSI-RS resources in two consecutive slots (which are the
same across two consecutive slots), as defined by higher layer parameter
*CSI-RS-resourceMapping*, is given by one of

\- , , or for frequency range 1 and frequency range 2,

\- , , , , , or for frequency range 2.

\- a single port CSI-RS resource with density given by Table 7.4.1.5.3-1
from \[4, TS 38.211\] and higher layer parameter *density* configured by
*CSI-RS-ResourceMapping.*

\- if carrier $N_{\text{grid}}^{\text{size},\mu} = 52$,
$N_{\text{BWP,i}}^{\text{size}} = 52$, $\mu = 0$ and the carrier is
configured in paired spectrum, the bandwidth of the CSI-RS resource, as
given by the higher layer parameter *freqBand* configured by
*CSI-RS-ResourceMapping*, is *X* resource blocks, where $X\  \geq \ 28$
resources if the UE indicates *trs-AddBW-Set1* for the
*trs-AdditionalBandwidth* capability and $X\  \geq \ 32$ if the UE
indicates *trs-AddBW-Set2* for the *AdditionalBandwidth* capability; in
these cases, if the UE is configured with CSI-RS comprising X\<52
resource blocks, the UE *does not expect that the total number of PRBs
allocated for DL transmissions but not overlapped with the PRBs carrying
CSI-RS for tracking is more than 4, where* all CSI-RS resource
configurations shall span the same set of resource blocks; otherwise,
the bandwidth of the CSI-RS resource, as given by the higher layer
parameter *freqBand* configured by *CSI-RS-ResourceMapping*, is the
minimum of 52 and $N_{\text{BWP,i}}^{\text{size}}$ resource blocks, or
is equal to $N_{\text{BWP,i}}^{\text{size}}$ resource blocks. For
operation with shared spectrum channel access, *freqBand* configured by
*CSI-RS-ResourceMapping*, is the minimum of 48 and
$N_{\text{BWP,i}}^{\text{size}}$ resource blocks, or is equal to
$N_{\text{BWP,i}}^{\text{size}}$ resource blocks.

\- the UE is not expected to be configured with the periodicity of slots
if the bandwidth of CSI-RS resource is larger than 52 resource blocks.

\- the periodicity and slot offset for periodic NZP CSI-RS resources, as
given by the higher layer parameter *periodicityAndOffset* configured
b*y NZP-CSI-RS-Resource*, is one of slots where 10, 20, 40, or 80 and
where µ is defined in Clause 4.3 of \[4, TS 38.211\].

\- same *powerControlOffset* and *powerControlOffsetSS* given by
*NZP-CSI-RS-Resource* value across all resources.

##### 5.1.6.1.2 CSI-RS for L1-RSRP and L1-SINR computation

If a UE is configured with a *NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet* configured with
the higher layer parameter *repetition* set to \'on\', the UE may assume
that the CSI-RS resources, described in Clause 5.2.2.3.1, within the
*NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet* are transmitted with the same downlink spatial
domain transmission filter, where the CSI-RS resources in the
*NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet* are transmitted in different OFDM symbols. If
*repetition* is set to \'off\', the UE shall not assume that the CSI-RS
resources within the *NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet* are transmitted with the
same downlink spatial domain transmission filter.

If the UE is configured with a *CSI-ReportConfig* with *reportQuantity*
set to \'cri-RSRP\', \'cri-SINR\' or \'none\' and if the
*CSI-ResourceConfig* for channel measurement (higher layer parameter
*resourcesForChannelMeasurement*) contains a *NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet*
that is configured with the higher layer parameter *repetition* and
without the higher layer parameter *trs-Info*, the UE can only be
configured with the same number (1 or 2) of ports with the higher layer
parameter *nrofPorts* for all CSI-RS resources within the set. If the UE
is configured with the CSI-RS resource in the same OFDM symbol(s) as an
SS/PBCH block, the UE may assume that the CSI-RS and the SS/PBCH block
are quasi co-located with \'typeD\' if \'typeD\' is applicable.
Furthermore, the UE shall not expect to be configured with the CSI-RS in
PRBs that overlap with those of the SS/PBCH block, and the UE shall
expect that the same subcarrier spacing is used for both the CSI-RS and
the SS/PBCH block.

##### 5.1.6.1.3 CSI-RS for mobility

If a UE is configured with the higher layer parameter
*CSI-RS-Resource-Mobility* and the higher layer parameter
*associatedSSB* is not configured, the UE shall perform measurements
based on *CSI-RS-Resource-Mobility* and the UE may base the timing of
the CSI-RS resource on the timing of the serving cell.

If a UE is configured with the higher layer parameters
*CSI-RS-Resource-Mobility* and *associatedSSB*, the UE may base the
timing of the CSI-RS resource on the timing of the cell given by the
*cellId* of the CSI-RS resource configuration. Additionally, for a given
CSI-RS resource, if the associated SS/PBCH block is configured but not
detected by the UE, the UE is not required to monitor the corresponding
CSI-RS resource. The higher layer parameter *isQuasiColocated* indicates
whether the associated SS/PBCH block given by the *associatedSSB* and
the CSI-RS resource(s) are quasi co-located with respect to \'typeD\',
when applicable.

If a UE is configured with the higher layer parameter
*CSI-RS-Resource-Mobility* and with periodicity greater than 10 msec in
paired spectrum, the UE may assume the absolute value of the time
difference between radio frame *i* between any two cells, listed in the
configuration with the higher layer parameter *CSI-RS-CellMobility* and
with same *refFreqCSI-RS*, is less than 153600 *T~s~*.

If the UE is configured with DRX, the UE is not required to perform
measurement of CSI-RS resources other than during the active time for
measurements based on *CSI-RS-Resource-Mobility*. When the UE is
configured to monitor DCI format 2\_6, the UE is not required to perform
measurements other than during the active time and during the timer
duration indicated by *drx-onDurationTimer* in *DRX-Config* also outside
active time based on *CSI-RS-Resource-Mobility*.

If the UE is configured with DRX and DRX cycle in use is larger than 80
msec, the UE may not expect CSI-RS resources are available other than
during the active time for measurements based on
*CSI-RS-Resource-Mobility*. If the UE is configured with DRX and
configured to monitor DCI format 2\_6 and DRX cycle in use is larger
than 80 msec, the UE may not expect that the CSI-RS resources are
available other than during the active time and during the time duration
indicated by *drx-onDurationTimer* in *DRX-Config* also outside active
time for measurements based on *CSI-RS-Resource-Mobility.* Otherwise,
the UE may assume CSI-RS are available for measurements based on
*CSI-RS-Resource-Mobility*.

A UE configured with the higher layer parameters
*CSI-RS-Resource-Mobility* may expect to be configured

\- with no more than 96 CSI-RS resources per higher layer parameter
*MeasObjectNR* for UEs not supporting
\[*increasedNumberofCSIRSPerMO-r16*\] when all CSI-RS resources
configured by the same higher layer parameter *MeasObjectNR* have been
configured with *associatedSSB*, or,

\- with no more than 192 CSI-RS resources per higher layer parameter
*MeasObjectNR* for UEs supporting \[*increasedNumberofCSIRSPerMO-r16*\]
when all CSI-RS resources configured by the same higher layer parameter
*MeasObjectNR* have been configured with *associatedSSB*, or,

\- with no more than 64 CSI-RS resources per higher layer parameter
*MeasObjectNR* when all CSI-RS resources have been configured without
*associatedSSB* or when only some of the CSI-RS resources have been
configured with associatedSSB by the same higher layer parameter
*MeasObjectNR*

\- For frequency range 1 the *associatedSSB* is optionally present for
each CSI-RS resource.

\- For frequency range 2 the *associatedSSB* is either present for all
configured CSI-RS resources or not present for any configured CSI-RS
resource per higher layer parameter *MeasObjectNR*.

For any CSI-RS resource configuration, the UE shall assume that the
value for parameter *cdm-Type* is \'noCDM\', and there is only one
antenna port.

#### 5.1.6.2 DM-RS reception procedure

The DM-RS reception procedures for PDSCH scheduled by PDCCH with DCI
format 1\_1 described in this clause equally apply to PDSCH scheduled by
PDCCH with DCI format 1\_2, by applying the parameters of
*dmrs-DownlinkForPDSCH-MappingTypeA-DCI-1-2* and
*dmrs-DownlinkForPDSCH-MappingTypeB-DCI-1-2* instead of
*dmrs-DownlinkForPDSCH-MappingTypeA* and
*dmrs-DownlinkForPDSCH-MappingTypeB*.

When receiving PDSCH scheduled by DCI format 1\_0 or receiving PDSCH
before dedicated higher layer configuration of any of the parameters
*dmrs-AdditionalPosition*, *maxLength* and *dmrs-Type,* the UE shall
assume that the PDSCH is not present in any symbol carrying DM-RS except
for PDSCH with allocation duration of 2 symbols with PDSCH mapping type
B (described in clause 7.4.1.1.2 of \[4, TS 38.211\]), and a single
symbol front-loaded DM-RS of configuration type 1 on DM-RS port 1000 is
transmitted, and that all the remaining orthogonal antenna ports are not
associated with transmission of PDSCH to another UE and in addition

\- For PDSCH with mapping type A and type B, the UE shall assume
*dmrs-AdditionalPosition*=\'pos2\' and up to two additional
single-symbol DM-RS present in a slot according to the PDSCH duration
indicated in the DCI as defined in Clause 7.4.1.1 of \[4, TS 38.211\],
and

\- For PDSCH with allocation duration of 2 symbols with mapping type B,
the UE shall assume that the PDSCH is present in the symbol carrying
DM-RS.

When receiving PDSCH scheduled by DCI format 1\_1 by PDCCH with CRC
scrambled by C-RNTI, MCS-C-RNTI, or CS-RNTI,

\- the UE may be configured with the higher layer parameter *dmrs-Type*,
and the configured DM-RS configuration type is used for receiving PDSCH
in as defined in Clause 7.4.1.1 of \[4, TS 38.211\].

\- the UE may be configured with the maximum number of front-loaded
DM-RS symbols for PDSCH by higher layer parameter *maxLength* given by
*DMRS-DownlinkConfig..*

\- if *maxLength* is set to \'len1\', single-symbol DM-RS can be
scheduled for the UE by DCI, and the UE can be configured with a number
of additional DM-RS for PDSCH by higher layer parameter
*dmrs-AdditionalPosition,* which can be set to \'pos0\', \'pos1\',
\'pos2\' or \'pos3\'.

\- if *maxLength* is set to \'len2\', both single-symbol DM-RS and
double symbol DM-RS can be scheduled for the UE by DCI, and the UE can
be configured with a number of additional DM-RS for PDSCH by higher
layer parameter *dmrs-AdditionalPosition,* which can be set to \'pos0\'
or \'pos1\'.

\- and the UE shall assume to receive additional DM-RS as specified in
Table 7.4.1.1.2-3 and Table 7.4.1.1.2-4 as described in Clause 7.4.1.1.2
of \[4, TS 38.211\].

For the UE-specific reference signals generation as defined in Clause
7.4.1.1 of \[4, TS 38.211\], a UE can be configured by higher layers
with one or two scrambling identity(s), $n_{\text{ID}}^{DMRS,i}\ $*i* =
0,1 which are the same for both PDSCH mapping Type A and Type B.

A UE may be scheduled with a number of DM-RS ports by the antenna port
index in DCI format 1\_1 as described in Clause 7.3.1.2 of \[5, TS
38.212\].

For DM-RS configuration type 1,

\- if a UE is scheduled with one codeword and assigned with the antenna
port mapping with indices of {2, 9, 10, 11 or 30} in Table 7.3.1.2.2-1
and Table 7.3.1.2.2-2 of Clause 7.3.1.2 of \[5, TS 38.212\], or

\- if a UE is scheduled with one codeword and assigned with the antenna
port mapping with indices of {2, 9, 10, 11 or 12} in Table 7.3.1.2.2-1A
and {2, 9, 10, 11, 30 or 31} in Table 7.3.1.2.2-2A of Clause 7.3.1.2 of
\[5, TS 38.212\], or

\- if a UE is scheduled with two codewords,

the UE may assume that all the remaining orthogonal antenna ports are
not associated with transmission of PDSCH to another UE.

For DM-RS configuration type 2,

\- if a UE is scheduled with one codeword and assigned with the antenna
port mapping with indices of {2, 10 or 23} in Table 7.3.1.2.2-3 and
Table 7.3.1.2.2-4 of Clause 7.3.1.2 of \[5, TS38.212\], or

\- if a UE is scheduled with one codeword and assigned with the antenna
port mapping with indices of {2, 10, 23 or 24} in Table 7.3.1.2.2-3A and
{2, 10, 23 or 58} in Table 7.3.1.2.2-4A of Clause 7.3.1.2 of \[5, TS
38.212\], or

\- if a UE is scheduled with two codewords,

the UE may assume that all the remaining orthogonal antenna ports are
not associated with transmission of PDSCH to another UE.

If a UE receiving PDSCH scheduled by DCI format 1\_2 is configured with
the higher layer parameter *phaseTrackingRS* in
*dmrs-DownlinkForPDSCH-MappingTypeA-DCI-1-2 or
dmrs-DownlinkForPDSCH-MappingTypeB-DCI-1-2* or a UE receiving PDSCH
scheduled by DCI format 1\_0 or DCI format 1\_1 is configured with the
higher layer parameter *phaseTrackingRS* in
*dmrs-DownlinkForPDSCH-MappingTypeA or
dmrs-DownlinkForPDSCH-MappingTypeB*, the UE may assume that the
following configurations are not occurring simultaneously for the
received PDSCH:

\- any DM-RS ports among 1004-1007 or 1006-1011 for DM-RS configurations
type 1 and type 2, respectively are scheduled for the UE and the other
UE(s) sharing the DM-RS REs on the same CDM group(s), and

\- PT-RS is transmitted to the UE.

The UE is not expected to simultaneously be configured with the maximum
number of front-loaded DM-RS symbols for PDSCH by higher layer parameter
*maxLength being set* equal to \'len2\' and more than one additional
DM-RS symbol as given by the higher layer parameter
*dmrs-AdditionalPosition*.

*The UE is not expected to assume co-scheduled UE(s) with different
DM-RS configuration with respect to the actual number of front-loaded
DM-RS symbol(s), the actual number of additional DM-RS, the DM-RS symbol
location, and DM-RS configuration type as described in Clause 7.4.1.1 of
\[4, TS 38.211\].*

*The UE does not expect the precoding of the potential co-scheduled
UE(s) in other DM-RS ports of the same CDM group to be different in the
PRG-level grid configured to this UE with PRG =2 or 4.*

*The UE does not expect the resource allocation of the potential
co-scheduled UE(s) in other DM-RS ports of the same CDM group to be
misaligned in the PRG-level grid to this UE with PRG=2 or 4.*

When receiving PDSCH scheduled by DCI format 1\_1, the UE shall assume
that the CDM groups indicated in the configured index from Tables
7.3.1.2.2-1, 7.3.1.2.2-1A, 7.3.1.2.2-2, 7.3.1.2.2-2A, 7.3.1.2.2-3,
7.3.1.2.2-3A, 7.3.1.2.2-4, 7.3.1.2.2-4A of \[5, TS. 38.212\] contain
potential co-scheduled downlink DM-RS and are not used for data
transmission, where \"1\", \"2\" and \"3\" for the number of DM-RS CDM
group(s) in Tables 7.3.1.2.2-1, 7.3.1.2.2-1A, 7.3.1.2.2-2, 7.3.1.2.2-3,
7.3.1.2.2-3A, 7.3.1.2.2-4, 7.3.1.2.2-4A of \[5, TS. 38.212\] correspond
to CDM group 0, {0,1}, {0,1,2}, respectively.

When receiving PDSCH scheduled by DCI format 1\_0, the UE shall assume
the number of DM-RS CDM groups without data is 1 which corresponds to
CDM group 0 for the case of PDSCH with allocation duration of 2 symbols,
and the UE shall assume that the number of DM-RS CDM groups without data
is 2 which corresponds to CDM group {0,1} for all other cases.

The UE is not expected to receive PDSCH scheduling DCI which indicates
CDM group(s) with potential DM-RS ports which overlap with any
configured CSI-RS resource(s) for that UE.

If the UE receives the DM-RS for PDSCH and an SS/PBCH block in the same
OFDM symbol(s), then the UE may assume that the DM-RS and SS/PBCH block
are quasi co-located with \'typeD\', if \'typeD\' is applicable.
Furthermore, the UE shall not expect to receive DM-RS in resource
elements that overlap with those of the SS/PBCH block, and the UE can
expect that the same or different subcarrier spacing is configured for
the DM-RS and SS/PBCH block in a CC except for the case of 240 kHz where
only different subcarrier spacing is supported.

If at least one TCI codepoint indicates two TCI states and the UE
receives the DM-RS for PDSCH and an SS/PBCH block in the same OFDM
symbol(s), then the UE may assume that at least one DM-RS port for the
PDSCH and SS/PBCH block are quasi co-located with \'QCL-TypeD\', if
\'QCL-TypeD\' is applicable.

If the UE is configured by higher layer parameter PDCCH-Config that
contains two different values of CORESETPoolIndex in different
ControlResourceSets, and the UE receives the DM-RS for PDSCH(s) and an
SS/PBCH block in the same OFDM symbol(s), then the UE may assume that at
least one DM-RS port for the PDSCH(s) and SS/PBCH block are quasi
co-located with \'QCL-TypeD\', if \'QCL-TypeD\' is applicable.

If a UE is configured by the higher layer parameter *PDCCH-Config* that
contains two different values of *coresetPoolIndex* in
*ControlResourceSet*, the UE may be scheduled with fully or partially
overlapping PDSCHs in the time and frequency domain by multiple PDCCHs
with the following restrictions,

\- the UE is not expected to assume different DM-RS configuration with
respect to the actual number of front-loaded DM-RS symbol(s), the actual
number of additional DM-RS symbol(s), the actual DM-RS symbol location,
and DM-RS configuration type.

\- the UE is not expected to assume DM-RS ports in a CDM group indicated
by two TCI states.

When a UE is not indicated with a DCI that DCI field \'*Time domain
resource assignment*\' indicating an entry *which contains
repetitionNumber* in *PDSCH-TimeDomainResourceAllocation* and it is
indicated with two TCI states in a codepoint of the DCI field
*\'Transmission Configuration Indication\'* and DM-RS port(s) within two
CDM groups in the DCI field \'*Antenna Port(s)\',*

\- the first TCI state corresponds to the CDM group of the first antenna
port indicated by the antenna port indication table, and the second TCI
state corresponds to the other CDM group.

#### 5.1.6.3 PT-RS reception procedure

The procedures on PT-RS reception described in this clause apply to a UE
receiving PDSCH scheduled by DCI format 1\_2 configured with the higher
layer parameter *phaseTrackingRS* in
*dmrs-DownlinkForPDSCH-MappingTypeA-DCI-1-2 or
dmrs-DownlinkForPDSCH-MappingTypeB-DCI-1-2* and to a UE receiving PDSCH
scheduled by DCI format 1\_0 or DCI format 1\_1 configured with the
higher layer parameter *phaseTrackingRS* in
*dmrs-DownlinkForPDSCH-MappingTypeA or
dmrs-DownlinkForPDSCH-MappingTypeB*.

A UE shall report the preferred MCS and bandwidth thresholds based on
the UE capability at a given carrier frequency, for each subcarrier
spacing applicable to data channel at this carrier frequency, assuming
the MCS table with the maximum Modulation Order as it reported to
support.

If a UE is configured with the higher layer parameter *phaseTrackingRS*
in *DMRS-DownlinkConfig*,

\- the higher layer parameters *timeDensity* and *frequencyDensity* in
*PTRS-DownlinkConfig* indicate the threshold values *ptrs-MCS~i~*,
*i*=1,2,3 and *N~RB,i~* , *i*=0,1, as shown in Table 5.1.6.3-1 and Table
5.1.6.3-2, respectively.

\- if either or both of the additional higher layer parameters
*timeDensity* and *frequencyDensity* are configured, and the RNTI equals
MCS-C-RNTI, C-RNTI or CS-RNTI, the UE shall assume the PT-RS antenna
port\' presence and pattern is a function of the corresponding scheduled
MCS of the corresponding codeword and scheduled bandwidth in
corresponding bandwidth part as shown in Table 5.1.6.3-1 and Table
5.1.6.3-2,

\- if the higher layer parameter *timeDensity* given by
*PTRS-DownlinkConfig* is not configured, the UE shall assume
*L~PT-RS\ ~*= 1.

\- if the higher layer parameter *frequencyDensity* given by
*PTRS-DownlinkConfig* is not configured, the UE shall assume *K~PT-RS~*
= 2.

\- otherwise, if neither of the additional higher layer parameters
*timeDensity* and *frequencyDensity* are configured and the RNTI equals
MCS-C-RNTI, C-RNTI or CS-RNTI, the UE shall assume the PT-RS is present
with *L~PT-RS\ ~*= 1, *K~PT-RS~* = 2, and the UE shall assume PT-RS is
not present when

\- the scheduled MCS from Table 5.1.3.1-1 is smaller than 10, or

\- the scheduled MCS from Table 5.1.3.1-2 is smaller than 5, or

\- the scheduled MCS from Table 5.1.3.1-3 is smaller than 15, or

\- the number of scheduled RBs is smaller than 3, or

\- otherwise, if the RNTI equals RA-RNTI, \[MSGB-RNTI\], SI-RNTI, or
P-RNTI, the UE shall assume PT-RS is not present

Table 5.1.6.3-1: Time density of PT-RS as a function of scheduled MCS

  Scheduled MCS                   Time density ()
  ------------------------------- ----------------------
  I~MCS~ \< ptrs-MCS~1~           PT-RS is not present
  ptrs-MCS1 I~MCS~ \< ptrs-MCS2   4
  ptrs-MCS2 I~MCS~ \< ptrs-MCS3   2
  ptrs-MCS3 I~MCS~ \< ptrs-MCS4   1

Table 5.1.6.3-2: Frequency density of PT-RS as a function of scheduled
bandwidth

  Scheduled bandwidth            Frequency density ()
  ------------------------------ ----------------------
  *N~RB~* \< *N~RB0~*            PT-RS is not present
  *N~RB0~* *N~RB~* \< *N~RB1~*   2
  *N~RB1~* *N~RB~*               4

If a UE is not configured with the higher layer parameter
*phaseTrackingRS* in *DMRS-DownlinkConfig*, the UE assumes PT-RS is not
present.

The higher layer parameter *PTRS-DownlinkConfig* provides the parameters
*ptrs-MCS~i~*, *i=1,2,3* and with values in range 0-29 when MCS Table
5.1.3.1-1 or MCS Table 5.1.3.1-3 is used and 0-28 when MCS Table
5.1.3.1-2 is used, respectively. *ptrs-MCS4* is not explicitly
configured by higher layers but assumed 29 when MCS Table 5.1.3.1-1 or
MCS Table 5.1.3.1-3 is used and 28 when MCS Table 5.1.3.1-2 is used,
respectively. The higher layer parameter *frequencyDensity in
PTRS-DownlinkConfig* provides the parameters *N~RBi~* *i=0,1* with
values in range 1-276.

If the higher layer parameter *PTRS-DownlinkConfig* indicates that the
time density thresholds *ptrs-MCS~i~* = *ptrs-MCS~i+1~*, then the time
density *L~PT-RS~* of the associated row where both these thresholds
appear in Table 5.1.6.3-1 is disabled. If the higher layer parameter
*PTRS-DownlinkConfig* indicates that the frequency density thresholds
*N~RBi~* = *N~RBi~* *~+1~*, then the frequency density *K~PTRS~* of the
associated row where both these thresholds appear in Table 5.1.6.3-2 is
disabled.

If either or both of the parameters PT-RS time density (*L~PT-RS~*) and
PT-RS frequency density (*K~PT-RS~*), shown in Table 5.1.6.3-1 and Table
5.1.6.3-2, indicates that \'PT-RS not present\', the UE shall assume
that PT-RS is not present.

When the UE is receiving a PDSCH with allocation duration of 2 symbols
as defined in Clause 7.4.1.1.2 of \[4, TS 38.211\] and if *L~PT-RS~* is
set to 2 or 4, the UE shall assume PT-RS is not transmitted.

When the UE is receiving a PDSCH with allocation duration of 4 symbols
and if *L~PT-RS~* is set to 4, the UE shall assume PT-RS is not
transmitted.

When a UE is receiving PDSCH for retransmission, if the UE is scheduled
with an MCS index greater than V, where V=28 for MCS Table 5.1.3.1-1 and
Table 5.1.3.1-3, and V=27 for MCS Table 5.1.3.1-2 respectively, the MCS
for the PT-RS time-density determination is obtained from the DCI
received for the same transport block in the initial transmission, which
is smaller than or equal to V.

The DL DM-RS port(s) associated with a PT-RS port are assumed to be
quasi co-located with respect to \'typeA\' and \'typeD\'. If a UE is
scheduled with one codeword, the PT-RS antenna port is associated with
the lowest indexed DM-RS antenna port among the DM-RS antenna ports
assigned for the PDSCH.

If a UE is scheduled with two codewords, the PT-RS antenna port is
associated with the lowest indexed DM-RS antenna port among the DM-RS
antenna ports assigned for the codeword with the higher MCS. If the MCS
indices of the two codewords are the same, the PT-RS antenna port is
associated with the lowest indexed DM-RS antenna port assigned for
codeword 0.

When a UE is not indicated with a DCI that DCI field \'*Time domain
resource assignment*\' indicating an entry *which contains
repetitionNumber* in *PDSCH-TimeDomainResourceAllocation*, and if the UE
is configured with the higher layer parameter *maxNrofPorts* equal to
*n2*, and if the UE is indicated with two TCI states by the codepoints
of the DCI field *\'Transmission Configuration Indication\'* and DM-RS
port(s) within two CDM groups in the DCI field \'*Antenna Port(s)\'*,
the UE shall receive two PT-RS ports which are associated to the lowest
indexed DM-RS port among the DM-RS ports corresponding to the
first/second indicated TCI state, respectively.

When a UE configured by the higher layer parameter *repetitionScheme*
set to \'*fdmSchemeA\'* or \'*fdmSchemeB\',* and the UE is indicated
with two TCI states in a codepoint of the DCI field *\'Transmission
Configuration Indication\'* and DM-RS port(s) within one CDM group in
the DCI field \'*Antenna Port(s)*\', the UE shall receive a single PT-RS
port which is associated with the lowest indexed DM-RS antenna port
among the DM-RS antenna ports assigned for the PDSCH, a PT-RS frequency
density is determined by the number of PRBs associated to each TCI
state, and a PT-RS resource element mapping is associated to the
allocated PRBs for each TCI state.

#### 5.1.6.4 SRS reception procedure for CLI

The SRS resources defined in Clause 6.4.1.4 of \[4, TS 38.211\] may be
configured for SRS-RSRP measurement for CLI, as defined in Clause 5.1.19
of \[7, TS 38.215\]. The UE is not expected to measure SRS-RSRP with a
subcarrier spacing other than the one configured for the active BWP
confining the SRS resource. The UE is not expected to measure SRS-RSRP
using the SRS-RSRP measurement resource which is not fully confined
within the DL active BWP. The UE is not expected to measure more than 32
SRS resources, and the UE is not expected to receive more than 8 SRS
resources in a slot.

#### 5.1.6.5 PRS reception procedure

The UE can be configured with one or more DL PRS resource set
configuration(s) as indicated by the higher layer parameters
*NR-DL-PRS-ResourceSet* and *NR-DL-PRS-Resource as* defined by Clause
6.4.3 \[17, TS 37.355\]. Each DL PRS resource set consists of K≥1 DL PRS
resource(s) where each has an associated spatial transmission filter.
The UE can be configured with one or more DL PRS positioning frequency
layer configuration(s) as indicated by the higher layer parameter
*NR-DL-PRS-PositioningFrequencyLayer.* A DL PRS positioning frequency
layer is defined as a collection of DL PRS resource sets which have
common parameters configured by *NR-DL-PRS-PositioningFrequencyLayer*.

The UE assumes that the following parameters for each DL PRS resource(s)
are configured via higher layer parameters
*NR-DL-PRS-PositioningFrequencyLayer, NR-DL-PRS-ResourceSet* and
*NR-DL-PRS-Resource*.

A DL PRS positioning frequency layer is configured by
*NR-DL-PRS-PositioningFrequencyLayer,* consists of one or more DL PRS
resource sets and it is defined by:

*- dl-PRS-SubcarrierSpacing* defines the subcarrier spacing for the DL
PRS resource. All DL PRS resources and DL PRS resource sets in the same
DL PRS positioning frequency layer have the same value of
*dl-PRS-SubcarrierSpacing*. The supported values of
*dl-PRS-SubcarrierSpacing* are given in Table 4.2-1 of \[4, TS38.211\],
excluding the value of 240kHz.

*- dl-PRS-CyclicPrefix* defines the cyclic prefix for the DL PRS
resource. All DL PRS Resources and DL PRS Resource sets in the same DL
PRS positioning frequency layer have the same value of
*dl-PRS-CyclicPrefix.* The supported values of *dl-PRS-CyclicPrefix* are
given in Table 4.2-1 of \[4, TS38.211\].

*- dl-PRS-PointA* defines the absolute frequency of the reference
resource block. Its lowest subcarrier is also known as Point A. All DL
PRS resources belonging to the same DL PRS resource set have common
Point A and all DL PRS resources sets belonging to the same DL PRS
positioning frequency layer have a common Point A.

The UE expects that it will be configured with *dl-PRS-ID* each of which
is defined such that it is associated with multiple DL PRS resource
sets. The UE expects that one of these *dl-PRS-ID* along with a
*nr-DL-PRS-ResourceSetID* and a *nr-DL-PRS-ResourceID-r16* can be used
to uniquely identify a DL PRS resource.

The UE may be configured by the network with *nr-PhysCellID*,
*nr-CellGlobalID*, and *nr-ARFCN* \[17, TS 37.355\] associated with a
*dl-PRS-ID*.

\- If *nr-PhysCellID* or *nr-CellGlobalID* is provided, and if
*nr-PhysCellID*, *nr-CellGlobalID* and *nr-ARFCN* associated with the
*dl-PRS-ID*, if provided, are the same as the corresponding information
of a serving cell, the UE may assume that the DL PRS is transmitted from
the serving cell;

\- Otherwise, the UE may assume that the DL PRS is not transmitted from
a serving cell.

If the UE assumes that the DL PRS is transmitted from a serving cell,
and if the serving cell is the same as the serving cell defined by the
SS/PBCH block, the UE may assume that the DL PRS and the SS/PBCH block
are transmitted from the same serving cell.

If the UE assumes that the DL PRS is not transmitted from a serving
cell, and if *nr-PhysCellID* is provided, and is the same as physical
cell ID of the SS/PBCH block from a non-serving cell of the same band as
the DL PRS, the UE may assume that the DL PRS and the SS/PBCH block are
transmitted from the same non-serving cell.

A DL PRS resource set is configured by *NR-DL-PRS-ResourceSet*, consists
of one or more DL PRS resources and it is defined by:

*- nr-DL-PRS-ResourceSetID* defines the identity of the DL PRS resource
set configuration.

*- dl-PRS-Periodicity-and-ResourceSetSlotOffset* defines the DL PRS
resource periodicity and takes values
$T_{\text{per}}^{\text{PRS}} \in 2^{\mu}\left\{ 4,\ 5,\ 8,\ 10,\ 16,\ 20,\ 32,\ 40,\ 64,\ 80,\ 160,\ 320,\ 640,\ 1280,\ 2560,\ 5120,\ 10240 \right\}\ $slots,
where $\mu = 0,\ 1,\ 2,\ 3\ $for *dl-PRS-SubcarrierSpacing*=15, 30, 60
and 120 kHz respectively and the slot offset for DL PRS resource set
with respect to SFN0 slot 0. All the DL PRS resources within one DL PRS
resource set are configured with the same DL PRS resource periodicity.
The UE does not expect that the product of DL PRS resource periodicity
$T_{\text{per}}^{\text{PRS}}$*, the* higher layer parameter
*dl-prs-MutingBitRepetitionFactor* and the size of the bitmap of
*dl-PRS-MutingOption1* exceeds $2^{\mu} \times 10240$, where
$\mu = 0,\ 1,\ 2,\ 3\ $for *dl-PRS-SubcarrierSpacing*=15, 30, 60 and 120
kHz respectively.

*- dl-PRS-ResourceRepetitionFactor* defines how many times each DL-PRS
resource is repeated for a single instance of the DL-PRS resource set
and takes values
$T_{\text{rep}}^{\text{PRS}} \in \left\{ 1,2,4,6,8,16,32 \right\}$. All
the DL PRS resources within one resource set have the same resource
repetition factor.

*- dl-PRS-ResourceTimeGap* defines the offset in number of slots between
two repeated instances of a DL PRS resource with the same
*nr-DL-PRS-ResourceID* within a single instance of the DL PRS resource
set. The UE only expects to be configured with *dl-PRS-ResourceTimeGap*
if *dl-PRS-ResourceRepetitionFactor* is configured with value greater
than 1. The time duration spanned by one instance of a
*nr-DL-PRS-ResourceSet* is not expected to exceed the configured value
of DL PRS periodicity. All the DL PRS resources within one resource set
have the same value of *dl-PRS-ResourceTimeGap.*

*- dl-PRS-MutingOption1* and *dl-PRS-MutingOption2* define the time
locations where the DL PRS resource is expected to not be transmitted
for a DL PRS resource set. If *dl-PRS-MutingOption1* is configured, each
bit in the bitmap of *dl-PRS-MutingOption1* corresponds to a
configurable number provided by higher layer parameter
*dl-prs-MutingBitRepetitionFactor* of consecutive instances of a DL PRS
resource set where all the DL PRS resources within the set are muted for
the instance that is indicated to be muted. The length of the bitmap can
be {2, 4, 6, 8, 16, 32} bits. If *dl-PRS-MutingOption2* is configured
each bit in the bitmap of *dl-PRS-MutingOption2* corresponds to a single
repetition index for each of the DL PRS resources within each instance
of a *nr-DL-PRS-ResourceSet* and the length of the bitmap is equal to
the values of *dl-PRS-ResourceRepetitionFactor*. Both
*dl-PRS-MutingOption1* and *dl-PRS-MutingOption2* may be configured at
the same time in which case the logical AND operation is applied to the
bit maps as described in Clause 7.4.1.7.4 of \[4, TS 38.211\].

*- NR-DL-PRS-SFN0-Offset* defines the time offset of the SFN0 slot 0 for
the DL PRS resource set with respect to SFN0 slot 0 of reference
provided by *nr-DL-PRS-ReferenceInfo*.

*- dl-PRS-ResourceList* determines the DL PRS resources that are
contained within one DL PRS resource set.

*- dl-PRS-CombSizeN* defines the comb size of a DL PRS resource where
the allowable values are given in Clause 7.4.1.7.3 of \[TS38.211\]. All
DL PRS resource sets belonging to the same DL PRS positioning frequency
layer have the same value of *dl-PRS-CombSizeN*.

*- dl-PRS-ResourceBandwidth* defines the number of resource blocks
configured for DL PRS transmission. The parameter has a granularity of 4
PRBs with a minimum of 24 PRBs and a maximum of 272 PRBs. All DL PRS
resources sets within a DL PRS positioning frequency layer have the same
value of *dl-PRS-ResourceBandwidth*.

*- dl-PRS-StartPRB* defines the starting PRB index of the DL PRS
resource with respect to reference Point A, where reference Point A is
given by the higher-layer parameter *dl-PRS-PointA*. The starting PRB
index has a granularity of one PRB with a minimum value of 0 and a
maximum value of 2176 PRBs. All DL PRS resource sets belonging to the
same DL PRS positioning frequency layer have the same value of
*dl-PRS-StartPRB*.

*- dl-PRS-NumSymbols* defines the number of symbols of the DL PRS
resource within a slot where the allowable values are given in Clause
7.4.1.7.3 of \[4, TS38.211\].

A DL PRS resource is defined by:

*- nr-DL-PRS-ResourceID* determines the DL PRS resource configuration
identity. All DL PRS resource IDs are locally defined within a DL PRS
resource set.

*- dl-PRS-SequenceID* is used to initialize c~init~ value used in pseudo
random generator as described in Clause 7.4.1.7.2 of \[4, TS 38.211\]
for generation of DL PRS sequence for a given DL PRS resource.

*- dl-PRS-CombSizeN-AndReOffset* defines the starting RE offset of the
first symbol within a DL PRS resource in frequency. The relative RE
offsets of the remaining symbols within a DL PRS resource are defined
based on the initial offset and the rule described in Clause 7.4.1.7.3
of \[4, TS 38.211\].

*- dl-PRS-ResourceSlotOffset* determines the starting slot of the DL PRS
resource with respect to corresponding DL PRS resource set slot offset.

*- dl-PRS-ResourceSymbolOffset* determines the starting symbol of a slot
configured with the DL PRS resource.

*- dl-PRS-QCL-Info* defines any quasi co-location information of the DL
PRS resource with other reference signals. The DL PRS may be configured
with QCL \'typeD\' with a DL PRS associated with the same *dl-PRS-ID*,
or with *rs-Type* set to \'typeC\', \'typeD\', or \'typeC-plus-typeD\'
with a SS/PBCH Block from a serving or non-serving cell.

The UE assumes constant EPRE is used for all REs of a given DL PRS
resource.

The UE may be indicated by the network that DL PRS resource(s) can be
used as the reference for the DL RSTD, DL PRS-RSRP, and UE Rx-Tx time
difference measurements in a higher layer parameter
*nr-DL-PRS-ReferenceInfo*. The reference indicated by the network to the
UE can also be used by the UE to determine how to apply higher layer
parameters *nr-DL-PRS-ExpectedRSTD* and
*nr-DL-PRS-ExpectedRSTD-Uncertainty*. The UE expects the reference to be
indicated whenever it is expected to receive the DL PRS. This reference
provided by *nr-DL-PRS-ReferenceInfo* may include a *dl-PRS-ID*, a DL
PRS resource set ID, and optionally a single DL PRS resource ID or a
list of DL PRS resource IDs \[17, TS 37.355\]. The UE may use different
DL PRS resources or a different DL PRS resource set to determine the
reference for the RSTD measurement as long as the condition that the DL
PRS resources used belong to a single DL PRS resource set is met. If the
UE chooses to use a different reference than indicated by the network,
then it is expected to report the *dl-PRS-ID*, the DL PRS resource ID(s)
or the DL PRS resource set ID used to determine the reference.

The UE may be configured to report quality metrics *NR-TimingQuality*
corresponding to the DL RSTD and UE Rx-Tx time difference measurements
which include the following fields:

*- timingQualityValue* which provides the best estimate of the
uncertainty of the measurement

*- timingQualityResolution* which specifies the resolution levels used
in the *timingQualityValue* field.

The UE expects to be configured with higher layer parameter
*nr-DL-PRS-ExpectedRSTD*, which defines the time difference with respect
to the received DL subframe timing the UE is expected to receive DL PRS,
and *nr-DL-PRS-ExpectedRSTD-Uncertainty*, which defines a search window
around the *nr-DL-PRS-ExpectedRSTD*.

For DL UE positioning measurement reporting in higher layer parameters
***NR-DL-TDOA-SignalMeasurementInformation*** or
***NR-Multi-RTT-SignalMeasurementInformation*** the UE can be configured
to report the DL PRS resource ID(s) or the DL PRS resource set ID(s)
associated with the DL PRS resource(s) or the DL PRS resource set(s)
which are used in determining the UE measurements DL RSTD, or UE Rx-Tx
time difference, respectively.

For the DL RSTD, DL PRS-RSRP, and UE Rx-Tx time difference measurements
the UE reports an associated higher layer parameter *nr-TimeStamp*. The
*nr-TimeStamp* can include the *dl-PRS-ID*, the SFN and the slot number
for a subcarrier spacing. These values correspond to the reference which
is provided by *nr-DL-PRS-ReferenceInfo*.

The UE is expected to measure the DL PRS resource outside the active DL
BWP or with a numerology different from the numerology of the active DL
BWP if the measurement is made during a configured measurement gap. When
the UE is expected to measure the DL PRS resource, it may request a
measurement gap via higher layer parameter *NR-PRS-MeasurementInfoList
\[12, TS 38.331\]*.

The UE assumes that the DL PRS from the serving cell is not mapped to
any symbol that contains SS/PBCH block from the serving cell. If the
time frequency location of the SS/PBCH block transmissions from
non-serving cells are provided to the UE then the UE also assumes that
the DL PRS from a non-serving cell is not mapped to any symbol that
contains the SS/PBCH block of the same non-serving cell.

The UE may be configured to measure and report, subject to UE
capability, up to 4 DL RSTD measurements per pair of *dl-PRS-ID* with
each measurement between a different pair of DL PRS resources or DL PRS
resource sets within the DL PRS configured for those *dl-PRS-ID*. The up
to 4 measurements being performed on the same pair of *dl-PRS-ID* and
all DL RSTD measurements in the same report use a single reference
timing.

The UE may be configured to measure and report, subject to UE
capability, up to 8 DL PRS-RSRP measurements on different DL PRS
resources associated with the same *dl-PRS-ID*. When the UE reports DL
PRS-RSRP measurements from one DL PRS resource set, the UE may indicate
which DL PRS-RSRP measurements associated with the same higher layer
parameter *nr-DL-PRS-RxBeamIndex* *\[17, TS 37.355\]* have been
performed using the same spatial domain filter for reception if for each
*nr-DL-PRS-RxBeamIndex* reported there are at least 2 DL PRS-RSRP
measurements associated with it within the DL PRS resource set.

The UE may be configured to measure and report, subject to UE
capability, up to 4 UE Rx-Tx time difference measurements corresponding
to a single configured SRS resource or resource set for positioning.
Each measurement corresponds to a single received DL PRS resource or
resource set which can be in different DL PRS positioning frequency
layers.

The UE may be configured to measure and report, subject to UE
capability, the timing and the quality metrics of up to 2 additional
detected paths that are associated with each RSTD or UE Rx -- Tx time
difference. The timing of each additional path is reported relative to
the path timing used for determining *nr-RSTD* or *nr-UE-RxTxTimeDiff*.

If the UE is configured with *DL-PRS-QCL-Info* and the QCL relation is
between two DL PRS resources, then the UE assumes those DL PRS resources
are associated with the same *dl-PRS-ID*. If *DL-PRS-QCL-Info* is
configured to the UE with *QCL* set to \'type-D\' with a source DL PRS
resource then the *nr-DL-PRS-ResourceSetId* and the
*nr-DL-PRS-ResourceId* of the source DL PRS resource are expected to be
indicated to the UE.

UE is not expected to process DL PRS without configuration of
measurement gap.

Within a DL PRS positioning frequency layer, the DL PRS resources are
sorted in the decreasing order of priority for measurement to be
performed by the UE, with the reference indicated by
*nr-DL-PRS-ReferenceInfo* being the highest priority for measurement,
and the following priority is assumed:

\- Up to 64 *NR-SelectedDL-PRS-IndexPerTRP* of the DL PRS positioning
frequency layer are sorted according to priority if
*nr-SelectedDL-PRS-IndexListPerFreq* is provided, or up to 64
*NR-DL-PRS-AssistanceDataPerTRP* of the frequency layer are sorted
according to priority otherwise;

\- Up to 2 *DL-SelectedPRS-ResourceSetIndex* per *dl-PRS-ID* of the DL
PRS positioning frequency layer are sorted according to priority if
*dl-SelectedPRS-ResourceSetIndexList* is provided, or up to 2
*NR-DL-PRS-ResourceSet* per *dl-PRS-ID* of the DL PRS positioning
frequency layer are sorted according to priority otherwise.

For the case when measurement gap is configured, the UE DL PRS
processing capability is defined in \[TS 37.355\]. For the purpose of DL
PRS processing capability, the duration *K* *msec* of DL PRS symbols
within *P* *msec* window, is calculated by

*-* Type 1 duration calculation with UE symbol level buffering
capability

$${K = \sum_{s \in S}^{}K_{s}
}{K_{s} = T_{s}^{\text{end}} - T_{s}^{\text{start}}}$$

*-* Type 2 duration calculation with UE slot level buffering capability

$$K = \frac{1}{2^{\mu}}\left| S \right|$$

*- S* is the set of slots based on the numerology of the DL PRS of a
serving cell within the *P* msec window in the DL PRS positioning
frequency layer that contains potential DL PRS resources considering the
actual *nr-DL-PRS-ExpectedRSTD*, *nr-DL-PRS-ExpectedRSTD-Uncertainty*
provided for each pair of DL PRS Resource Sets.

*-* For Type 1,
$\left\lbrack T_{s}^{\text{start}},\ T_{s}^{\text{end}} \right\rbrack$
is the smallest interval in *msec* within slot $s$ corresponding to an
integer number of OFDM symbols based on the numerology of the DL PRS of
a serving cell that covers the union of the potential PRS symbols and
determines the PRS symbol occupancy within slot $s$, where the interval
$\left\lbrack T_{s}^{\text{start}},\ T_{s}^{\text{end}} \right\rbrack$
considers the actual *nr-DL-PRS-ExpectedRSTD*,
*nr-DL-PRS-ExpectedRSTD-Uncertainty* provided for each pair of DL PRS
resource sets (target and reference).

*-* For Type 2, $\mu$ is the numerology of the DL PRS, and
$\left| S \right|$ is the cardinality of the set $S$.

### 5.1.7 Code block group based PDSCH transmission

#### 5.1.7.1 UE procedure for grouping of code blocks to code block groups

If a UE is configured to receive code block group (CBG) based
transmissions by receiving the higher layer parameter
*codeBlockGroupTransmission* for PDSCH, the UE shall determine the
number of CBGs for a transport block reception as

,

where *N* is the maximum number of CBGs per transport block as
configured by *maxCodeBlockGroupsPerTransportBlock* for PDSCH, and *C*
is the number of code blocks in the transport block according to the
procedure defined in Clause 7.2.3 of \[5, TS 38.212\].

#### 5.1.7.2 UE procedure for receiving code block group based transmissions

If a UE is configured to receive code block group-based transmissions by
receiving the higher layer parameter *codeBlockGroupTransmission* for
PDSCH,

\- The *\'CBG transmission information\'* (CBGTI) field of DCI format
1\_1 is of length $N_{\text{TB}} \bullet N\ $ bits, where
$N_{\text{TB}}$ is the value of the higher layer parameter
*maxNrofCodeWordsScheduledByDCI*. If $N_{\text{TB}} = 2$ the CBGTI field
bits are mapped such that the first set of $N\ $ bits starting from the
MSB corresponds to the first TB while the second set of $N\ $ bits
corresponds to a second TB, if scheduled. The first *M* bits of each set
of $N\ $ bits in the CBGTI field have an in-order one-to-one mapping
with the *M* CBGs of the TB, with the MSB mapped to CBG\#0.

\- For initial transmission of a TB as indicated by the \'*New Data
Indicator\'* field of the scheduling DCI, the UE may assume that all the
code block groups of the TB are present.

\- For a retransmission of a TB as indicated by the \'*New Data
Indicator\'* field of the scheduling DCI, the UE may assume that

\- The \'*CBGTI\'* field of the scheduling DCI indicates which CBGs of
the TB are present in the transmission. A bit value of \'0\' in the
*CBGTI* field indicates that the corresponding CBG is not transmitted
and \'1\' indicates that it is transmitted.

\- If the *\'CBG flushing out information\'* *(CBGFI)* field of the
scheduling DCI is present, \'*CBGFI\'* set to \'0\' indicates that the
earlier received instances of the same CBGs being transmitted may be
corrupted, and \'*CBGFI\'* set to \'1\' indicates that the CBGs being
retransmitted are combinable with the earlier received instances of the
same CBGs.

\- A CBG contains the same CBs as in the initial transmission of the TB.

5.2 UE procedure for reporting channel state information (CSI)
--------------------------------------------------------------

### 5.2.1 Channel state information framework

The procedures on aperiodic CSI reporting described in this clause
assume that the CSI reporting is triggered by DCI format 0\_1, but they
equally apply to CSI reporting triggered by DCI format 0\_2, by applying
the higher layer parameter *reportTriggerSizeDCI-0-2* instead of
*reportTriggerSize*.

The time and frequency resources that can be used by the UE to report
CSI are controlled by the gNB. CSI may consist of Channel Quality
Indicator (CQI), precoding matrix indicator (PMI), CSI-RS resource
indicator (CRI), SS/PBCH Block Resource indicator (SSBRI), layer
indicator (LI), rank indicator (RI), L1-RSRP or L1-SINR.

For CQI, PMI, CRI, SSBRI, LI, RI, L1-RSRP, L1-SINR a UE is configured by
higher layers with N≥1 *CSI-ReportConfig* Reporting Settings, M≥1
*CSI-ResourceConfig* Resource Settings, and one or two list(s) of
trigger states (given by the higher layer parameters
*CSI-AperiodicTriggerStateList* and
*CSI-SemiPersistentOnPUSCH-TriggerStateList*). Each trigger state in
*CSI-AperiodicTriggerStateList* contains a list of associated
*CSI-ReportConfigs* indicating the Resource Set IDs for channel and
optionally for interference. Each trigger state in
*CSI-SemiPersistentOnPUSCH-TriggerStateList* contains one associated
*CSI-ReportConfig*.

#### 5.2.1.1 Reporting settings

Each Reporting Setting *CSI-ReportConfig* is associated with a single
downlink BWP (indicated by higher layer parameter *BWP-Id*) given in the
associated *CSI-ResourceConfig* for channel measurement and contains the
parameter(s) for one CSI reporting band: codebook configuration
including codebook subset restriction, time-domain behavior, frequency
granularity for CQI and PMI, measurement restriction configurations, and
the CSI-related quantities to be reported by the UE such as the layer
indicator (LI), L1-RSRP, L1-SINR, CRI, and SSBRI (SSB Resource
Indicator).

The time domain behavior of the *CSI-ReportConfig* is indicated by the
higher layer parameter *reportConfigType* and can be set to
\'aperiodic\', \'semiPersistentOnPUCCH\', \'semiPersistentOnPUSCH\', or
\'periodic\'. For \'periodic\' and
\'semiPersistentOnPUCCH\'/\'semiPersistentOnPUSCH\' CSI reporting, the
configured periodicity and slot offset applies in the numerology of the
UL BWP in which the CSI report is configured to be transmitted on. The
higher layer parameter *reportQuantity* indicates the CSI-related,
L1-RSRP-related or L1-SINR-related quantities to report. The
*reportFreqConfiguration* indicates the reporting granularity in the
frequency domain, including the CSI reporting band and if PMI/CQI
reporting is wideband or sub-band. The
*timeRestrictionForChannelMeasurements* parameter in *CSI-ReportConfig*
can be configured to enable time domain restriction for channel
measurements and *timeRestrictionForInterferenceMeasurements* can be
configured to enable time domain restriction for interference
measurements. The *CSI-ReportConfig* can also contain *CodebookConfig*,
which contains configuration parameters for Type-I, Type II or Enhanced
Type II CSI including codebook subset restriction, and configurations of
group-based reporting. A UE is not expected to be configured with a CSI
report setting associated with a dormant DL BWP if the
*reportConfigType* is set to \'aperiodic\'.

#### 5.2.1.2 Resource settings

Each CSI Resource Setting *CSI-ResourceConfig* contains a configuration
of a list of S≥1 CSI Resource Sets (given by higher layer parameter
*csi-RS-ResourceSetList*), where the list is comprised of references to
either or both of NZP CSI-RS resource set(s) and SS/PBCH block set(s) or
the list is comprised of references to CSI-IM resource set(s). Each CSI
Resource Setting is located in the DL BWP identified by the higher layer
parameter *BWP-id*, and all CSI Resource Settings linked to a CSI Report
Setting have the same DL BWP.

The time domain behavior of the CSI-RS resources within a CSI Resource
Setting are indicated by the higher layer parameter *resourceType* and
can be set to aperiodic, periodic, or semi-persistent. For periodic and
semi-persistent CSI Resource Settings, the number of CSI-RS Resource
Sets configured is limited to S=1. For periodic and semi-persistent CSI
Resource Settings, the configured periodicity and slot offset is given
in the numerology of its associated DL BWP, as given by *BWP-id.* When a
UE is configured with multiple *CSI-ResourceConfigs* consisting the same
NZP CSI-RS resource ID, the same time domain behavior shall be
configured for the *CSI-ResourceConfigs*. When a UE is configured with
multiple *CSI-ResourceConfigs* consisting the same CSI-IM resource ID,
the same time-domain behavior shall be configured for the
*CSI-ResourceConfigs*. All CSI Resource Settings linked to a CSI Report
Setting shall have the same time domain behavior.

The following are configured via higher layer signaling for one or more
CSI Resource Settings for channel and interference measurement:

\- CSI-IM resource for interference measurement as described in Clause
5.2.2.4.

\- NZP CSI-RS resource for interference measurement as described in
Clause 5.2.2.3.1.

\- NZP CSI-RS resource for channel measurement as described in Clause
5.2.2.3.1.

The UE may assume that the NZP CSI-RS resource(s) for channel
measurement and the CSI-IM resource(s) for interference measurement
configured for one CSI reporting are resource-wise QCLed with respect to
\'typeD\'. When NZP CSI-RS resource(s) is used for interference
measurement, the UE may assume that the NZP CSI-RS resource for channel
measurement and the CSI- IM resource or NZP CSI-RS resource(s) for
interference measurement configured for one CSI reporting are QCLed with
respect to \'typeD\'.

For L1-SINR measurement:

\- When one Resource Setting is configured, the Resource Setting (given
by higher layer parameter *resourcesForChannelMeasurement*) is for
channel and interference measurement on NZP CSI-RS for L1-SINR
computation. UE may assume that same 1 port NZP CSI-RS resource(s) with
density 3 REs/RB is used for both channel and interference measurements.

\- When two Resource Settings are configured, the first one Resource
Setting (given by higher layer parameter
*resourcesForChannelMeasurement*) is for channel measurement on SSB or
NZP CSI-RS and the second one (given by either higher layer parameter
*csi-IM-ResourcesForInterference* or higher layer parameter
*nzp-CSI-RS-ResourcesForInterference*) is for interference measurement
performed on CSI-IM or on 1 port NZP CSI-RS with density 3 REs/RB, where
each SSB or NZP CSI-RS resource for channel measurement is associated
with one CSI-IM resource or one NZP CSI-RS resource for interference
measurement by the ordering of the SSB or NZP CSI-RS resource for
channel measurement and CSI-IM resource or NZP CSI-RS resource for
interference measurement in the corresponding resource sets. The number
of SSB(s) or CSI-RS resources for channel measurement equals to the
number of CSI-IM resources or the number of NZP CSI-RS resource for
interference measurement.

\- UE may apply the SSB, or \'typeD\' RS configured with *qcl-Type* set
to \'typeD\' to the NZP CSI-RS resource for channel measurement, as the
reference RS for determining \'typeD\' assumption for the
corresponding CSI-IM resource or the corresponding NZP CSI-RS resource
for interference measurement configured for one CSI reporting.

\- UE may expect that the NZP CSI-RS resource set for channel
measurement and the NZP-CSI-RS resource set for interference
measurement, if any, are configured with the higher layer parameter
*repetition*.

#### 5.2.1.3 (void)

#### 5.2.1.4 Reporting configurations

The UE shall calculate CSI parameters (if reported) assuming the
following dependencies between CSI parameters (if reported)

\- LI shall be calculated conditioned on the reported CQI, PMI, RI and
CRI

\- CQI shall be calculated conditioned on the reported PMI, RI and CRI

\- PMI shall be calculated conditioned on the reported RI and CRI

\- RI shall be calculated conditioned on the reported CRI.

The Reporting configuration for CSI can be aperiodic (using PUSCH),
periodic (using PUCCH) or semi-persistent (using PUCCH, and DCI
activated PUSCH). The CSI-RS Resources can be periodic, semi-persistent,
or aperiodic. Table 5.2.1.4-1 shows the supported combinations of CSI
Reporting configurations and CSI-RS Resource configurations and how the
CSI Reporting is triggered for each CSI-RS Resource configuration.
Periodic CSI-RS is configured by higher layers. Semi-persistent CSI-RS
is activated and deactivated as described in Clause 5.2.1.5.2. Aperiodic
CSI-RS is configured and triggered/activated as described in Clause
5.2.1.5.1.

Table 5.2.1.4-1: Triggering/Activation of CSI Reporting for the possible
CSI-RS Configurations.

  Semi-Persistent CSI-RS   Not Supported                      For reporting on PUCCH, the UE receives an activation command, as described in clause 6.1.3.16 of \[10, TS 38.321\]; for reporting on PUSCH, the UE receives triggering on DCI   Triggered by DCI; additionally, subselection indication as described in clause 6.1.3.13 of \[10, TS 38.321\] possible as defined in Clause 5.2.1.5.1.
  Aperiodic CSI-RS         Not Supported                      Not Supported                                                                                                                                                                    Triggered by DCI; additionally, subselection indication as described in clause 6.1.3.13 of \[10, TS 38.321\] possible as defined in Clause 5.2.1.5.1.

When the UE is configured with higher layer parameter
*NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet* and when the higher layer parameter
*repetition* is set to \'off\', the UE shall determine a CRI from the
supported set of CRI values as defined in Clause 6.3.1.1.2 of \[5, TS
38.212\] and report the number in each CRI report. When the higher layer
parameter *repetition* is set to \'on\', CRI is not reported. CRI
reporting is not supported when the higher layer parameter
*codebookType* is set to either \'typeII\', \'typeII-PortSelection\',
\'typeII-r16\' or to \'typeII-PortSelection-r16\'.

For a periodic or semi-persistent CSI report on PUCCH, the periodicity
$T_{\text{CSI}}$ (measured in slots) and the slot offset
$T_{\text{offset}}$ are configured by the higher layer parameter
*reportSlotConfig*. Unless specified otherwise, the UE shall transmit
the CSI report in frames with SFN $n_{f}$ and slot number within the
frame $n_{s,f}^{\mu}$ satisfying

$\left( N_{\text{slot}}^{frame,\mu}n_{f} + n_{s,f}^{\mu} - T_{\text{offset}} \right)\text{mod\ }T_{\text{CSI}} = 0$

where $\text{\ μ}$ is the SCS configuration of the UL BWP the CSI report
is transmitted on.

For a semi-persistent CSI report on PUSCH, the periodicity
$T_{\text{CSI}}$ (measured in slots) is configured by the higher layer
parameter *reportSlotConfig.* Unless specified otherwise, the UE shall
transmit the CSI report in frames with SFN $n_{f}$ and slot number
within the frame $n_{s,f}^{\mu}$ satisfying

$\left( N_{\text{slot}}^{frame,\mu}(n_{f} - n_{f}^{\text{start}})\  + n_{s,f}^{\mu} - n_{s,f}^{\text{start}} \right)\text{mod\ }T_{\text{CSI}} = 0$

where $n_{f}^{\text{start}}$ and $n_{s,f}^{\text{start}}$ are the SFN
and slot number within the frame respectively of the initial
semi-persistent PUSCH transmission according to the activating DCI.

For a semi-persistent or aperiodic CSI report on PUSCH, the allowed slot
offsets are configured by the following higher layer parameters:

\- if triggered/activated by DCI format 0\_2 and the higher layer
parameter *reportSlotOffsetListDCI-0-2* is configured, the allowed slot
offsets are configured by *reportSlotOffsetListDCI-0-2*, and

\- if triggered/activated by DCI format 0\_1 and the higher layer
parameter *reportSlotOffsetListDCI-0-1* is configured, the allowed slot
offsets are configured by *reportSlotOffsetListDCI-0-1,* and

\- otherwise, the allowed slot offsets are configured by the higher
layer parameter *reportSlotOffsetList*.

The offset is selected in the activating/triggering DCI.

For CSI reporting, a UE can be configured via higher layer signaling
with one out of two possible subband sizes, where a subband is defined
as contiguous PRBs and depends on the total number of PRBs in the
bandwidth part according to Table 5.2.1.4-2.

Table 5.2.1.4-2: Configurable subband sizes

  **Bandwidth part (PRBs)**   **Subband size (PRBs)**
  --------------------------- -------------------------
  24 -- 72                    4, 8
  73 -- 144                   8, 16
  145 -- 275                  16, 32

The *reportFreqConfiguration* contained in a *CSI-ReportConfig*
indicates the frequency granularity of the CSI Report. A CSI Reporting
Setting configuration defines a CSI reporting band as a subset of
subbands of the bandwidth part, where the *reportFreqConfiguration*
indicates:

\- the *csi-ReportingBand* as a contiguous or non-contiguous subset of
subbands in the bandwidth part for which CSI shall be reported.

\- A UE is not expected to be configured with *csi-ReportingBand* which
contains a subband where a CSI-RS resource linked to the CSI Report
setting has the frequency density of each CSI-RS port per PRB in the
subband less than the configured density of the CSI-RS resource.

\- If a CSI-IM resource is linked to the CSI Report Setting, a UE is not
expected to be configured with *csi-ReportingBand* which contains a
subband where not all PRBs in the subband have the CSI-IM REs present.

\- wideband CQI or subband CQI reporting, as configured by the higher
layer parameter *cqi-FormatIndicator*. When wideband CQI reporting is
configured, a wideband CQI is reported for each codeword for the entire
CSI reporting band. When subband CQI reporting is configured, one CQI
for each codeword is reported for each subband in the CSI reporting
band.

\- wideband PMI or subband PMI reporting as configured by the higher
layer parameter *pmi-FormatIndicator*. When wideband PMI reporting is
configured, a wideband PMI is reported for the entire CSI reporting
band. When subband PMI reporting is configured, except with 2 antenna
ports, a single wideband indication (*i~1~* in Clause 5.2.2.2) is
reported for the entire CSI reporting band and one subband indication
(*i~2~* in clause 5.2.2.2) is reported for each subband in the CSI
reporting band. When subband PMIs are configured with 2 antenna ports, a
PMI is reported for each subband in the CSI reporting band.

\- a UE is not expected to be configured with *pmi-FormatIndicator* if
*codebookType* is set to \'typeII-r16\' or \'typeII-PortSelection-r16\'.

A CSI Reporting Setting is said to have a wideband frequency-granularity
if

\- *reportQuantity* is set to \'cri-RI-PMI-CQI\', or
\'cri-RI-LI-PMI-CQI\', *cqi-FormatIndicator* is set to \'widebandCQI\'
and *pmi-FormatIndicator* is set to \'widebandPMI\', or

\- *reportQuantity* is set to \'cri-RI-i1\' or

\- *reportQuantity* is set to \'cri-RI-CQI\' or \'cri-RI-i1-CQI\' and
*cqi-FormatIndicator* is set to \'widebandCQI\', or

\- *reportQuantity* is set to \'cri-RSRP\' or \'ssb-Index-RSRP\' or
\'cri-SINR\', or \'ssb-Index-SINR\'

otherwise, the CSI Reporting Setting is said to have a subband
frequency-granularity.

If the UE is configured with a CSI Reporting Setting for a bandwidth
part with fewer than 24 PRBs, the CSI reporting setting is expected to
have a wideband frequency-granularity, and, if applicable, the higher
layer parameter *codebookType* is set to \'typeI-SinglePanel\'.

The first subband size is given by and the last subband size given by if
and if

If a UE is configured with semi-persistent CSI reporting, the UE shall
report CSI when both CSI-IM and NZP CSI-RS resources are configured as
periodic or semi-persistent. If a UE is configured with aperiodic CSI
reporting, the UE shall report CSI when both CSI-IM and NZP CSI-RS
resources are configured as periodic, semi-persistent or aperiodic.

A UE configured with DCI format 0\_1 or 0\_2 does not expect to be
triggered with multiple CSI reports with the same *CSI-ReportConfigId*.

##### 5.2.1.4.1 Resource Setting configuration

For aperiodic CSI, each trigger state configured using the higher layer
parameter *CSI-AperiodicTriggerState* is associated with one or multiple
*CSI-ReportConfig* where each *CSI-ReportConfig* is linked to periodic,
or semi-persistent, or aperiodic resource setting(s):

\- When one Resource Setting is configured, the Resource Setting (given
by higher layer parameter *resourcesForChannelMeasurement*) is for
channel measurement for L1-RSRP or for channel and interference
measurement for L1-SINR computation.

\- When two Resource Settings are configured, the first one Resource
Setting (given by higher layer parameter
*resourcesForChannelMeasurement*) is for channel measurement and the
second one (given by either higher layer parameter
*csi-IM-ResourcesForInterference* or higher layer parameter
*nzp-CSI-RS-ResourcesForInterference*) is for interference measurement
performed on CSI-IM or on NZP CSI-RS.

\- When three Resource Settings are configured, the first Resource
Setting (higher layer parameter *resourcesForChannelMeasurement*) is for
channel measurement, the second one (given by higher layer parameter
*csi-IM-ResourcesForInterference*) is for CSI-IM based interference
measurement and the third one (given by higher layer parameter
*nzp-CSI-RS-ResourcesForInterference*) is for NZP CSI-RS based
interference measurement.

*For semi-persistent or periodic CSI,* each *CSI-ReportConfig* is linked
to periodic or semi-persistent Resource Setting(s):

\- When one Resource Setting (given by higher layer parameter
*resourcesForChannelMeasurement*) is configured, the Resource Setting is
for channel measurement for L1-RSRP or for channel and interference
measurement for L1-SINR computation.

\- When two Resource Settings are configured, the first Resource Setting
(given by higher layer parameter *resourcesForChannelMeasurement*) is
for channel measurement and the second Resource Setting (given by higher
layer parameter *csi-IM-ResourcesForInterference*) is used for
interference measurement performed on CSI-IM. For L1-SINR computation,
the second Resource Setting (given by higher layer parameter
*csi-IM-ResourcesForInterference* or higher layer parameter
*nzp-CSI-RS-ResourceForInterference*) is used for interference
measurement performed on CSI-IM or on NZP CSI-RS.

A UE is not expected to be configured with more than one CSI-RS resource
in resource set for channel measurement for a *CSI-ReportConfig* with
the higher layer parameter *codebookType* set to either \'typeII\',
\'typeII-PortSelection\', \'typeII-r16\' or to
\'typeII-PortSelection-r16\'. A UE is not expected to be configured with
more than 64 NZP CSI-RS resources and/or SS/PBCH block resources in
resource setting for channel measurement for a *CSI-ReportConfig* with
the higher layer parameter *reportQuantity* set to \'none\',
\'cri-RI-CQI\', \'cri-RSRP\', \'ssb-Index-RSRP\', \'cri-SINR\' or
\'ssb-Index-SINR\'. If interference measurement is performed on CSI-IM,
each CSI-RS resource for channel measurement is resource-wise associated
with a CSI-IM resource by the ordering of the CSI-RS resource and CSI-IM
resource in the corresponding resource sets. The number of CSI-RS
resources for channel measurement equals to the number of CSI-IM
resources.

Except for L1-SINR, if interference measurement is performed on NZP
CSI-RS, a UE does not expect to be configured with more than one NZP
CSI-RS resource in the associated resource set within the resource
setting for channel measurement. Except for L1-SINR, the UE configured
with the higher layer parameter *nzp-CSI-RS-ResourcesForInterference*
may expect no more than 18 NZP CSI-RS ports configured in a NZP CSI-RS
resource set.

For CSI measurement(s) other than L1-SINR, a UE assumes:

\- each NZP CSI-RS port configured for interference measurement
corresponds to an interference transmission layer.

\- all interference transmission layers on NZP CSI-RS ports for
interference measurement take into account the associated EPRE ratios
configured in 5.2.2.3.1;

> \- other interference signal on REs of NZP CSI-RS resource for channel
> measurement, NZP CSI-RS resource for interference measurement, or
> CSI-IM resource for interference measurement.

For L1-SINR measurement with dedicated interference measurement
resources, a UE assumes:

\- the total received power on dedicated NZP CSI-RS resource for
interference measurement or dedicated CSI-IM resource for interference
measurement corresponds to interference and noise.

##### 5.2.1.4.2 Report Quantity Configurations

A UE may be configured with a *CSI-ReportConfig* with the higher layer
parameter *reportQuantity* set to either \'none\', \'cri-RI-PMI-CQI \',
\'cri-RI-i1\', \'cri-RI-i1-CQI\', \'cri-RI-CQI\', \'cri-RSRP\',
\'cri-SINR\', \'ssb-Index-RSRP\', \'ssb-Index-SINR\' or
\'cri-RI-LI-PMI-CQI\'.

If the UE is configured with a *CSI-ReportConfig* with the higher layer
parameter *reportQuantity set to \'none\', then the UE shall not report
any quantity for the CSI-ReportConfig.*

If the UE is configured with a *CSI-ReportConfig* with the higher layer
parameter *reportQuantity* set to \'cri-RI-PMI-CQI\', or
\'cri-RI-LI-PMI-CQI\', the UE shall report a preferred precoder matrix
for the entire reporting band, or a preferred precoder matrix per
subband, according to Clause 5.2.2.2.

If the UE is configured with a *CSI-ReportConfig* with the higher layer
parameter *reportQuantity* set to \'cri-RI-i1\',

\- the UE expects, for that *CSI-ReportConfig,* to be configured with
higher layer parameter *codebookType* set to \'typeI-SinglePanel\' and
*pmi-FormatIndicator* set to \'widebandPMI\' and,

\- the UE shall report a PMI consisting of a single wideband indication
( in Clause 5.2.2.2.1) for the entire CSI reporting band.

If the UE is configured with a *CSI-ReportConfig* with the higher layer
parameter *reportQuantity* set to \'cri-RI-i1-CQI\',

\- the UE expects, for that *CSI-ReportConfig,* to be configured with
higher layer parameter *codebookType* set to \'typeI-SinglePanel\' and
*pmi-FormatIndicator* set to \'widebandPMI\' and,

\- the UE shall report a PMI consisting of a single wideband indication
( in Clause 5.2.2.2.1) for the entire CSI reporting band. The CQI is
calculated conditioned on the reported assuming PDSCH transmission with
precoders (corresponding to the same but different in Clause 5.2.2.2.1),
where the UE assumes that one precoder is randomly selected from the set
of precoders for each PRG on PDSCH, where the PRG size for CQI
calculation is configured by the higher layer parameter
*pdsch-BundleSizeForCSI*.

If the UE is configured with a *CSI-ReportConfig* with the higher layer
parameter *reportQuantity* set to \'cri-RI-CQI*\',*

\- if the UE is configured with higher layer parameter
*non-PMI-PortIndication* contained in a *CSI-ReportConfig,* *r* ports
are indicated in the order of layer ordering for rank *r* and each
CSI-RS resource in the CSI resource setting is linked to the
*CSI-ReportConfig* based on the order of the associated
*NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceId* in the linked CSI resource setting for channel
measurement given by higher layer parameter
*resourcesForChannelMeasurement*. The configured higher layer parameter
*non-PMI-PortIndication* contains a sequence of port indices, where are
the CSI-RS port indices associated with rank ν and where is the number
of ports in the CSI-RS resource. The UE shall only report RI
corresponding to the configured fields of *PortIndexFor8Ranks*.

\- if the UE is not configured with higher layer parameter
*non-PMI-PortIndication,* the UE assumes, for each CSI-RS resource in
the CSI resource setting linked to the *CSI-ReportConfig*, that the
CSI-RS port indices are associated with ranks where is the number of
ports in the CSI-RS resource.

\- When calculating the CQI for a rank, the UE shall use the ports
indicated for that rank for the selected CSI-RS resource. The precoder
for the indicated ports shall be assumed to be the identity matrix
scaled by .

If the UE is configured with a *CSI-ReportConfig* with the higher layer
parameter *reportQuantity set to \'cri-RSRP\' or \'ssb-Index-RSRP\',*

\- if the UE is configured with the higher layer parameter
*groupBasedBeamReporting* set to \'disabled\', the UE is not required to
update measurements for more than 64 CSI-RS and/or SSB resources, and
the UE shall report in a single report *nrofReportedRS* (higher layer
configured) different CRI or SSBRI for each report setting.

\- if the UE is configured with the higher layer parameter
*groupBasedBeamReporting* set to \'enabled\', the UE is not required to
update measurements for more than 64 CSI-RS and/or SSB resources, and
the UE shall report in a single reporting instance two different CRI or
SSBRI for each report setting, where CSI-RS and/or SSB resources can be
received simultaneously by the UE either with a single spatial domain
receive filter, or with multiple simultaneous spatial domain receive
filters.

If the UE is configured with a *CSI-ReportConfig* with the higher layer
parameter *reportQuantity set to \'cri-SINR\' or \'ssb-Index-SINR\',*

\- if the UE is configured with the higher layer parameter
*groupBasedBeamReporting* set to \'disabled\', *the UE shall report in a
single report* *nrofReportedRS* (higher layer configured) different CRI
or SSBRI for each report setting.

\- if the UE is configured with the higher layer parameter
*groupBasedBeamReporting* set to \'enabled\', the UE shall report in a
single reporting instance two different CRI or SSBRI for each report
setting, where CSI-RS and/or SSB resources can be received
simultaneously by the UE.

If the UE is configured with a *CSI-ReportConfig* with the higher layer

or \'cri-SINR\', and $K_{s} > 1\ $resources are configured in the
corresponding resource set for channel measurement, then the UE shall
derive the CSI parameters other than CRI conditioned on the reported
CRI, where CRI *k* (*k* ≥ 0) corresponds to the configured (*k*+1)-th
entry of associated *nzp-CSI-RS-Resources* in the corresponding
*NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet* for channel measurement, and (*k*+1)-th entry
of associated *csi-IM-Resource* in the corresponding
*csi-IM-ResourceSet* (if configured) or (*k*+1)-th entry of associated
*nzp-CSI-RS-Resources* in the corresponding *NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet* (if
configured for *CSI-ReportConfig* with *reportQuantity* set
to \'cri-SINR\') for interference measurement. If $K_{s} = 2\ $CSI-RS
resources are configured, each resource shall contain at most 16 CSI-RS
ports. If $2 < K_{s} \leq 8\ $CSI-RS resources are configured, each
resource shall contain at most 8 CSI-RS ports.

If the UE is configured with a *CSI-ReportConfig* with the higher layer
parameter *reportQuantity* set to \'ssb-Index-RSRP\', the UE shall
report SSBRI, where SSBRI *k* (*k* ≥ 0) corresponds to the configured
(*k*+1)-th entry of the associated *csi-SSB-ResourceList* in the
corresponding *CSI-SSB-ResourceSet.*

If the UE is configured with a *CSI-ReportConfig* with the higher layer
parameter *reportQuantity* set to \'ssb-Index-SINR\', the UE shall
derive L1-SINR conditioned on the reported SSBRI, where SSBRI *k* (*k* ≥
0) corresponds to the configured (*k*+1)-th entry of the associated
*csi-SSB-ResourceList* in the corresponding *CSI-SSB-ResourceSet* for
channel measurement, and (*k*+1)-th entry of associated
*csi-IM-Resource* in the corresponding *csi-IM-ResourceSet* (if
configured) or (*k*+1)-th entry of associated *nzp-CSI-RS-Resources* in
the corresponding *NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet* (if configured) for
interference measurement.

If the UE is configured with a *CSI-ReportConfig* with the higher layer
parameter *reportQuantity* set to \'cri-RI-PMI-CQI\', \' cri-RI-i1\',
\'cri-RI-i1-CQI\', \'cri-RI-CQI\' or \'cri-RI-LI-PMI-CQI\', then the UE
is not expected to be configured with more than 8 CSI-RS resources in a
CSI-RS resource set contained within a resource setting that is linked
to the *CSI-ReportConfig*.

If the UE is configured with a *CSI-ReportConfig* with the higher layer
parameter *reportQuantity* set to \'cri-RI-LI-PMI-CQI\', UE does not
expect the *CSI-ReportConfig* to be configured with higher layer
parameter *codebookType* set to \'*typeII-r16*\' or

If the UE is configured with a *CSI-ReportConfig* with higher layer
parameter *reportQuantity* set to \'cri-RSRP\', \'cri-SINR\' or \'none\'
and the *CSI-ReportConfig* is linked to a resource setting configured
with the higher layer parameter *resourceType* set to \'aperiodic\',
then the UE is not expected to be configured with more than 16 CSI-RS
resources in a CSI-RS resource set contained within the resource
setting.

The LI indicates which column of the precoder matrix of the reported PMI
corresponds to the strongest layer of the codeword corresponding to the
largest reported wideband CQI. If two wideband CQIs are reported and
have equal value, the LI corresponds to strongest layer of the first
codeword.

For operation with shared spectrum channel access, if the UE is
configured with a *CSI-ReportConfig* with higher layer parameter
*reportQuantity* set to \'cri-RI-PMI-CQI \', \'cri-RI-i1\',
\'cri-RI-i1-CQI\', \'cri-RI-CQI\' or \'cri-RI-LI-PMI-CQI\', the UE shall
derive:

\- the CSI parameters without averaging two or more instances of any
periodic or semi-persistent *nzp-CSI-RS-Resources* in the corresponding

measurement located in different DL transmissions,

\- the instances of the *nzp-CSI-RS-Resources* are not in the same
channel occupancy duration indicated by DCI format 2\_0, if the UE is
provided at least one of *SlotFormatIndicator* or co*-DurationList*; or

\- the instances of the *nzp-CSI-RS-Resources occur within a set of
consecutive symbols which are not all occupied by PDSCH(s) and/or
aperiodic CSI-RS(s) indicated by DCI formats, if any, and the
corresponding PDCCH(s), if the UE is neither provided with
CO-DurationsPerCell* nor *SlotFormatIndicator*, but is provided with
*csi-RS-ValidationWithDCI*

\- the interference measurements for computing CSI value based on
periodic/semi-persistent CSI-IM measured only in OFDM symbol(s) that
fulfill the same conditions under which the UE is expected to receive
periodic/semi-persistent CSI-RS as described in Clause 11.1 and Clause
11.1.1 of \[6, TS 38.213\].

##### 5.2.1.4.3 L1-RSRP Reporting

For L1-RSRP computation

\- the UE may be configured with CSI-RS resources, SS/PBCH Block
resources or both CSI-RS and SS/PBCH block resources, when resource-wise
quasi co-located with \'type C\' and \'typeD\' when applicable.

\- the UE may be configured with CSI-RS resource setting up to 16 CSI-RS
resource sets having up to 64 resources within each set. The total
number of different CSI-RS resources over all resource sets is no more
than 128.

For L1-RSRP reporting, if the higher layer parameter *nrofReportedRS* in
*CSI-ReportConfig* is configured to be one, the reported L1-RSRP value
is defined by a 7-bit value in the range \[-140, -44\] dBm with 1dB step
size, if the higher layer parameter *nrofReportedRS* is configured to be
larger than one, or if the higher layer parameter
*groupBasedBeamReporting* is configured as \'enabled\', the UE shall use
differential L1-RSRP based reporting, where the largest measured value
of L1-RSRP is quantized to a 7-bit value in the range \[-140, -44\] dBm
with 1dB step size, and the differential L1-RSRP is quantized to a 4-bit
value. The differential L1-RSRP value is computed with 2 dB step size
with a reference to the largest measured L1-RSRP value which is part of
the same L1-RSRP reporting instance. The mapping between the reported
L1-RSRP value and the measured quantity is described in \[11, TS
38.133\].

If the higher layer parameter *timeRestrictionForChannelMeasurements* in
*CSI-ReportConfig* is set to \"*notConfigured*\", the UE shall derive
the channel measurements for computing L1-RSRP value reported in uplink
slot *n* based on only the SS/PBCH or NZP CSI-RS, no later than the CSI
reference resource, (defined in TS 38.211\[4\]) associated with the CSI
resource setting.

If the higher layer parameter *timeRestrictionForChannelMeasurements* in
*CSI-ReportConfig* is set to \"*Configured*\", the UE shall derive the
channel measurements for computing L1-RSRP reported in uplink slot *n*
based on only the most recent, no later than the CSI reference resource,
occasion of SS/PBCH or NZP CSI-RS (defined in \[4, TS 38.211\])
associated with the CSI resource setting.

##### 5.2.1.4.4 L1-SINR Reporting

For L1-SINR computation, for channel measurement the UE may be
configured with NZP CSI-RS resources and/or SS/PBCH Block resources, for
interference measurement the UE may be configured with NZP CSI-RS or
CSI-IM resources.

\- for channel measurement, the UE may be configured with CSI-RS
resource setting with up to 16 resource sets, with a total of up to 64
CSI-RS resources or up to 64 SS/PBCH Block resources.

For L1-SINR reporting, if the higher layer parameter *nrofReportedRS* in
*CSI-ReportConfig* is configured to be one, the reported L1-SINR value
is defined by a 7-bit value in the range \[-23, 40\] dB with 0.5 dB step
size, and if the higher layer parameter *nrofReportedRS* is configured
to be larger than one, or if the higher layer parameter
*groupBasedBeamReporting* is configured as \'enabled\', the UE shall use
differential L1-SINR based reporting, where the largest measured value
of L1-SINR is quantized to a 7-bit value in the range \[-23, 40\] dB
with 0.5 dB step size, and the differential L1-SINR is quantized to a
4-bit value. The differential L1-SINR is computed with 1 dB step size
with a reference to the largest measured L1-SINR value which is part of
the same L1-SINR reporting instance. When NZP CSI-RS is configured for
channel measurement and/or interference measurement, the reported
L1-SINR values should not be compensated by the power offset(s) given by
higher layer parameter *powerControOffsetSS* or *powerControlOffset*.

When one or two resource settings are configured for L1-SINR measurement

\- If the higher layer parameter *timeRestrictionForChannelMeasurements*
in *CSI-ReportConfig* is set to *\'notConfigured\'*, the UE shall derive
the channel measurements for computing L1-SINR reported in uplink slot n
based on only the SSB or NZP CSI-RS, no later than the CSI reference
resource, (defined in TS 38.211\[4\]) associated with the CSI resource
setting.

\- If the higher layer parameter *timeRestrictionForChannelMeasurements*
in *CSI-ReportConfig* is set to *\'configured\'*, the UE shall derive
the channel measurements for computing L1-SINR reported in uplink slot n
based on only the most recent, no later than the CSI reference resource,
occasion of SSB or NZP CSI-RS (defined in \[4, TS 38.211\]) associated
with the CSI resource setting.

\- If the higher layer parameter
*timeRestrictionForInterferenceMeasurements* in *CSI-ReportConfig* is
set to *\'notConfigured\'*, the UE shall derive the interference
measurements for computing L1-SINR reported in uplink slot n based on
only the CSI-IM or NZP CSI-RS for interference measurement (defined in
\[4, TS 38.211\]) or NZP CSI-RS for channel and interference measurement
no later than the CSI reference resource associated with the CSI
resource setting.

\- If the higher layer parameter
*timeRestrictionForInterferenceMeasurements* in *CSI-ReportConfig* is
set to *\'configured\'*, the UE shall derive the interference
measurements for computing the L1-SINR reported in uplink slot n based
on the most recent, no later than the CSI reference resource, occasion
of CSI-IM or NZP CSI-RS for interference measurement (defined in \[4, TS
38.211\]) or NZP CSI-RS for channel and interference measurement
associated with the CSI resource setting.

#### 5.2.1.5 Triggering/activation of CSI Reports and CSI-RS

##### 5.2.1.5.1 Aperiodic CSI Reporting/Aperiodic CSI-RS when the triggering PDCCH and the CSI-RS have the same numerology

For CSI-RS resource sets associated with Resource Settings configured
with the higher layer parameter *resourceType* set to \'aperiodic\',
\'periodic\', or \'semi-persistent\', trigger states for Reporting
Setting(s) (configured with the higher layer parameter
*reportConfigType* set to \'aperiodic\') and/or Resource Setting for
channel and/or interference measurement on one or more component
carriers are configured using the higher layer parameter
*CSI-AperiodicTriggerStateList*. For aperiodic CSI report triggering, a
single set of CSI triggering states are higher layer configured, wherein
the CSI triggering states can be associated with any candidate DL BWP. A
UE is not expected to receive more than one DCI with non-zero *CSI
request* field per slot per cell. A UE is not expected to receive DCI
with non-zero *CSI request* field within a cell group in a slot
overlapping with any slot receiving DCI with non-zero *CSI request*
field in the same cell group. A UE is not expected to be configured with
different *TCI-StateId*\'s for the same aperiodic CSI-RS resource ID
configured in multiple aperiodic CSI-RS resource sets with the same
triggering offset in the same aperiodic trigger state. A UE is not
expected to receive more than one aperiodic CSI report request for
transmission in a given slot per cell. A UE is not expected to receive
an aperiodic CSI report request for transmission in a slot overlapping
with any slot having an aperiodic CSI report transmission in the same
cell group. If a UE does not indicate its capability of
*CSItriggerStateContainingNonactiveBWP* the UE is not expected to be
triggered with a CSI report for a non-active DL BWP. Otherwise, when a
UE is triggered with a CSI report for a DL BWP that is non-active when
expecting to receive the most recent occasion, no later than the CSI
reference resource, of the associated NZP CSI-RS, the UE is not expected
to report the CSI for the non-active DL BWP and the CSI report
associated with that BWP is omitted. When a UE is triggered with
aperiodic NZP CSI-RS in a DL BWP that is non-active when expecting to
receive the NZP CSI-RS, the UE is not expected to measure the aperiodic
CSI-RS. In the carrier of the serving cell expecting to receive that
associated NZP CSI-RS, if the active DL BWP when receiving the NZP
CSI-RS is different from the active DL BWP when receiving the triggering
DCI,

\- the last symbol of the PDCCH span of the DCI carrying the BWP
switching shall be no later than the last symbol of the PDCCH span of
the DCI carrying the CSI trigger, irrespective of whether they are in
the same carrier of a serving cell or not and irrespective of whether
they are in the same SCS or not;

\- the UE is not expected to have any other BWP switching in that
carrier after the last symbol of the PDCCH span covering the DCI
carrying the CSI trigger and before the first symbol of the triggered
NZP CSI-RS or CSI-IM.

A trigger state is initiated using the *CSI request* field in DCI.

\- When all the bits of *CSI request* field in DCI are set to zero, no
CSI is requested.

\- When the number of configured CSI triggering states in
*CSI-AperiodicTriggerStateList* is greater than , where is the number of
bits in the DCI *CSI request* field, the UE receives a subselection
indication, as described in clause 6.1.3.13 of \[10, TS 38.321\], used
to map up to trigger states to the codepoints of the *CSI request* field
in DCI. is configured by the higher layer parameter *reportTriggerSize*
where . When the UE would transmit a PUCCH with HARQ-ACK information in
slot *n* corresponding to the PDSCH carrying the subselection
indication, the corresponding action in \[10, TS 38.321\] and UE
assumption on the mapping of the selected CSI trigger state(s) to the
codepoint(s) of DCI CSI request field shall be applied starting from the
first slot that is after slot $n + {3N}_{\text{slot}}^{subframe,µ}$
where *μ* is the SCS configuration for the PUCCH.

\- When the number of CSI triggering states in
*CSI-AperiodicTriggerStateList* is less than or equal to , the *CSI
request* field in DCI directly indicates the triggering state.

\- For each aperiodic CSI-RS resource in a CSI-RS resource set
associated with each CSI triggering state, the UE is indicated the quasi
co-location configuration of quasi co-location RS source(s) and quasi
co-location type(s), as described in Clause 5.1.5, through higher layer
signaling of *qcl-info* which contains a list of references to
*TCI-State\'s* for the aperiodic CSI-RS resources associated with the
CSI triggering state. If a *State* referred to in the list is configured
with a reference to an RS configured with *qcl-Type* set to \'*typeD*\',
that RS may be an SS/PBCH block located in the same or different CC/DL
BWP or a CSI-RS resource configured as periodic or semi-persistent
located in the same or different CC/DL BWP.

\- If the scheduling offset between the last symbol of the PDCCH
carrying the triggering DCI and the first symbol of the aperiodic CSI-RS
resources in a *NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet* configured without higher layer
parameter *trs-Info* is smaller than the UE reported threshold
*beamSwitchTiming,* as defined in \[13, TS 38.306\], when the reported
value is one of the values of {14, 28, 48} and *enableBeamSwitchTiming*
is not provided, or is smaller than 48 when the UE provides
*beamSwitchTiming-r16*, *enableBeamSwitchTiming* is provided and the
*NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet* is configured with the higher layer parameter
*repetition* set to \'off\' or configured without the higher layer
parameter *repetition,* or is smaller than the UE reported threshold
*beamSwitchTiming-r16, when enableBeamSwitchTiming* is provided and the
*NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet* is configured with the higher layer parameter
*repetition* set to \'on\'.

\- If a UE is configured with
*enableDefaultTCI-StatePerCoresetPoolIndex* and the UE is configured by
higher layer parameter *PDCCH-Config* that contains two different values
of *coresetPoolIndex* in *ControlResourceSet*

\- if there is any other DL signal with an indicated TCI state in the
same symbols as the CSI-RS, the UE applies the QCL assumption of the
other DL signal also when receiving the aperiodic CSI-RS. The other DL
signal refers to PDSCH scheduled by a PDCCH associated with the same
*coresetPoolIndex* as the PDCCH triggering the aperiodic CSI-RS and
scheduled with offset larger than or equal to the threshold
*timeDurationForQCL,* as defined in \[13, TS 38.306\], aperiodic CSI-RS
triggered by a PDCCH associated with the same *coresetPoolIndex* as the
PDCCH triggering the aperiodic CSI-RS and scheduled with offset larger
than or equal to the UE reported threshold *beamSwitchTiming* when the
reported value is one of the values {14,28,48} and
*enableBeamSwitchTiming* is not provided, aperiodic CSI-RS triggered by
a PDCCH associated with the same *coresetPoolIndex* as the PDCCH
triggering the aperiodic CSI-RS and scheduled with offset larger than or
equal to 48 when the reported value of *beamSwitchTiming-r16* is one of
the values {224, 336} and *enableBeamSwitchTiming* is provided, periodic
CSI-RS, semi-persistent CSI-RS;

\- else, the UE applies the QCL parameter(s) of the CORESET associated
with a monitored search space with the lowest *controlResourceSetId*
among CORESETs, which are configured with the same value of
*coresetPoolIndex* as the PDCCH triggering that aperiodic CSI-RS, in the
latest slot in which one or more CORESETs are associated with the same
value of *coresetPoolIndex* as the PDCCH triggering that aperiodic
CSI-RS

\- else if **a UE is configured with** *enableTwoDefaultTCI-States*
**and at least one TCI codepoint is mapped to two TCI states**

\- if there is any other DL signal with an indicated TCI state in the
same symbols as the CSI-RS, the UE applies the QCL assumption of the
other DL signal also when receiving the aperiodic CSI-RS. The other DL
signal refers to PDSCH scheduled with offset larger than or equal to the
threshold *timeDurationForQCL,* as defined in \[13, TS 38.306\],
aperiodic CSI-RS scheduled with offset larger than or equal to the UE
reported threshold *beamSwitchTiming* when the reported value is one of
the values {14,28,48} and *enableBeamSwitchTiming* is not provided,
aperiodic CSI-RS scheduled with offset larger than or equal to 48 when
the reported value of *beamSwitchTiming-r16* is one of the values {224,
336} and *enableBeamSwitchTiming* is provided, periodic CSI-RS,
semi-persistent CSI-RS. If there is a PDSCH indicated with two TCI
states in the same symbols as the CSI-RS, the UE applies the first TCI
state of the two TCI states when receiving the aperiodic CSI-RS.

\- else, the UE applies the first one of two TCI states corresponding to
the lowest TCI codepoint among those **mapped to two TCI states** and
applicable to the PDSCH within the active BWP of the cell in which the
CSI-RS is to be received when receiving the aperiodic CSI-RS.

\- else if there is any other DL signal with an indicated TCI state in
the same symbols as the CSI-RS, the UE applies the QCL assumption of the
other DL signal also when receiving the aperiodic CSI-RS. The other DL
signal refers to PDSCH scheduled with offset larger than or equal to the
threshold *timeDurationForQCL,* as defined in \[13, TS 38.306\],
periodic CSI-RS, semi-persistent CSI-RS, aperiodic CSI-RS in a
*NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet* scheduled with offset larger than or equal to
the UE reported threshold *beamSwitchTiming* when the reported value is
one of the values {14,28,48} and when *enableBeamSwitchTiming* is not
provided or the *NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet* is configured with the higher
layer parameter *trs-Info* , aperiodic CSI-RS in a
*NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet* configured with the higher layer parameter
*repetition* set to \'off\' or configured without the higher layer
parameters *repetition* and *trs-Info* scheduled with offset larger than
or equal to 48 when the UE provides *beamSwitchTiming-r16* and
*enableBeamSwitchTiming* is provided, aperiodic CSI-RS in a
*NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet* configured with the higher layer parameter
*repetition* set to \'on\' scheduled with offset larger than or equal to
the UE reported threshold *beamSwitchTiming-r16 and
enableBeamSwitchTiming* is provided;

\- else if at least one CORESET is configured for the BWP in which the
aperiodic CSI-RS is received, when receiving the aperiodic CSI-RS, the
UE applies the QCL assumption used for the CORESET associated with a
monitored search space with the lowest *controlResourceSetId* in the
latest slot in which one or more CORESETs within the active BWP of the
serving cell are monitored;

> \- else if the UE is configured with *enableDefaultBeamForCCS* and
> when receiving the aperiodic CSI-RS, the UE applies the QCL assumption
> of the lowest-ID activated TCI state applicable to the PDSCH within
> the active BWP of the cell in which the CSI-RS is to be received.

\- If the scheduling offset between the last symbol of the PDCCH
carrying the triggering DCI and the first symbol of the aperiodic CSI-RS
resources in a *NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet* is equal to or greater than the
UE reported threshold *beamSwitchTiming* when the reported value is one
of the values of {14,28,48} and *enableBeamSwitchTiming* is not provided
and the *NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet* is not configured with higher layer
parameter *trs-Info*, or is equal to or greater than the UE reported
threshold *beamSwitchTiming* when the reported value is one of the
values of {14,28,48} and the *NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet* is configured with
higher layer parameter *trs-Info*, or is equal to or greater than 48
when the UE provides *beamSwitchTiming-r16* and *enableBeamSwitchTiming*
is provided and the *NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet* is configured with the
higher layer parameter *repetition* set to \'off\' or configured without
the higher layer parameters *repetition* and *trs-Info*, or is equal to
or greater than the UE reported threshold *beamSwitchTiming-r16, when
enableBeamSwitchTiming* is provided and the *NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet* is
configured with the higher layer parameter *repetition* set to \'on\',
the UE is expected to apply the QCL assumptions in the indicated TCI
states for the aperiodic CSI-RS resources in the CSI triggering state
indicated by the CSI trigger field in DCI.

\- The UE is not expected to receive aperiodic CSI-RS and
PDSCH/aperiodic CSI-RS associated with different values of
*coresetPoolIndex* in overlapped symbol(s). The UE is not expected to
receive aperiodic CSI-RS and semi-persistent/periodic CSI-RS with
different \'QCL-type D\' in overlapped symbol(s).

\- A non-zero codepoint of the CSI request field in the DCI is mapped to
a CSI triggering state according to the order of the associated
positions of the up to $2^{N_{\text{TS}}} - 1$ trigger states in
*CSI-AperiodicTriggerStateList* with codepoint \'1\' mapped to the
triggering state in the first position.

For a UE configured with the higher layer parameter
*CSI-AperiodicTriggerStateList*, if a Resource Setting linked to a
*CSI-ReportConfig* has multiple aperiodic resource sets, only one of the
aperiodic CSI-RS resource sets from the Resource Setting is associated
with the trigger state, and the UE is higher layer configured per
trigger state per Resource Setting to select the one CSI-IM/NZP CSI-RS
resource set from the Resource Setting.

When aperiodic CSI-RS is used with aperiodic reporting, the CSI-RS
offset is configured per resource set by the higher layer parameter
*aperiodicTriggeringOffset* or *aperiodicTriggeringOffset-r16*. The
CSI-RS triggering offset has the values of {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, ...,
15, 16, 24} slots. If the UE is not configured with
*minimumSchedulingOffsetK0* for any DL BWP and
*minimumSchedulingOffsetK2* for any UL BWP and if all the associated
trigger states do not have the higher layer parameter *qcl-Type* set to
\'typeD\' in the corresponding TCI states, the CSI-RS triggering offset
is fixed to zero. The aperiodic triggering offset of the CSI-IM follows
offset of the associated NZP CSI-RS for channel measurement. The
aperiodic CSI-RS is transmitted in a slot ,
$K_{s} = n + X + \left\lfloor \left( \frac{N_{slot,offset,PDCCH}^{\text{CA}}}{2^{\mu_{offset,PDCCH}}} - \frac{N_{slot,offset,CSIRS}^{\text{CA}}}{2^{\mu_{offset,CSIRS}}} \right) \bullet 2^{\mu_{\text{CSIRS}}} \right\rfloor$,
if UE is configured with *ca-SlotOffset* for at least one of the
triggered and triggering cell, and in slot , otherwise, and where

*- n* is the slot containing the triggering DCI, *X* is the CSI-RS
triggering offset according to the higher layer parameter
*aperiodicTriggeringOffset* or *aperiodicTriggeringOffset-r16*,

*-* $N_{\text{slot,\ offset,\ }\text{PDCCH}}^{\text{CA}}\ $and
$\mu_{\text{offset}\text{,PDCCH}}$ are
the$\text{\ N}_{\text{slot,\ offset}}^{\text{CA}}$ and the which are
determined by higher-layer configured *ca-SlotOffset* for the cell
receiving the PDCCH,
$N_{\text{slot,\ offset,\ }\text{CSIRS}}^{\text{CA}}\ $and
$\mu_{\text{offset}\text{,CSIRS}}$ are
the$\text{\ N}_{\text{slot,\ offset}}^{\text{CA}}$ and the which are
determined by higher-layer configured *ca-SlotOffset* for the cell
transmitting the CSI-RS respectively, as defined in \[4, TS 38.211\]
clause 4.5.

The UE does not expect that aperiodic CSI-RS is transmitted before the
OFDM symbol(s) carrying its triggering DCI. When the minimum scheduling
offset restriction is applied, UE is not expected to be triggered by CSI
triggering state indicated by the CSI request field in DCI in which
CSI-RS triggering offset is smaller than the currently applicable
minimum scheduling offset restriction *K*~0min~.

If interference measurement is performed on aperiodic NZP CSI-RS, a UE
is not expected to be configured with a different aperiodic triggering
offset of the NZP CSI-RS for interference measurement from the
associated NZP CSI-RS for channel measurement.

If the UE is configured with a single carrier for uplink, the UE is not
expected to transmit more than one aperiodic CSI report triggered by
different DCIs on overlapping OFDM symbols.

##### 5.2.1.5.1a Aperiodic CSI Reporting/Aperiodic CSI-RS when the triggering PDCCH and the CSI-RS have different numerologies

When the triggering PDCCH and the triggered aperiodic CSI-RS are of
different numerologies, the behavior defined in 5.2.1.5.1 for the case
where the numerologies are the same applies with the following
exceptions:

Beam switch timing:

\- If the scheduling offset between the last symbol of the PDCCH
carrying the triggering DCI and the first symbol of the aperiodic CSI-RS
resources in a *NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet* configured without higher layer
parameter *trs-Info* is smaller than *beamSwitchTiming* + *d*
$\bullet 2^{\mu_{\text{CSIRS}}}/2^{\mu_{\text{PDCCH}}}$ in CSI-RS
symbols*,* as defined in \[13, TS 38.306\], when the reported value is
one of the values of {14, 28, 48} and *enableBeamSwitchTiming* is not
provided, or is smaller than 48+
$d \bullet 2^{\mu_{\text{CSIRS}}}/2^{\mu_{\text{PDCCH}}}$ in CSI-RS
symbols when the UE provides *beamSwitchTiming-r16* and
*enableBeamSwitchTiming* is provided and the *NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet* is

latest slot in which one or more CORESETs within the active BWP of the
serving cell are monitored.

to apply the QCL assumptions in the indicated TCI states for the
aperiodic CSI-RS resources in the CSI triggering state indicated by the
CSI trigger field in DCI.

Aperiodic CSI-RS timing:

\- When the aperiodic CSI-RS is used with aperiodic CSI reporting, the
CSI-RS triggering offset *X* is configured per resource set by the
higher layer parameter *aperiodicTriggeringOffset* or
*aperiodicTriggeringOffset-r16,* including the case that the UE is not
configured with *minimumSchedulingOffsetK0* for any DL BWP or
*minimumSchedulingOffsetK2 for any* UL BWP and all the associated
trigger states do not have the higher layer parameter *qcl-Type* set to
\'typeD\' in the corresponding TCI states. The CSI-RS triggering offset
has the values of {0, 1, ..., 31} slots when the µ~PDCCH~ \< µ~CSIRS~
and {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, ..., 15, 16, 24} when the µ~PDCCH~ \>
µ~CSIRS~.. The aperiodic CSI-RS is transmitted in a slot , if UE is
configured with *ca-SlotOffset* for at least one of the triggered and
triggering cell, and *K~s\ ~*= ![](media/image145.wmf){width="1.0in"
height="0.5145833333333333in"}, otherwise, and where

*- n* is the slot containing the triggering DCI, *X* is the CSI-RS
triggering offset in the numerology of CSI-RS according to the higher
layer parameter *aperiodicTriggeringOffset* or
*aperiodicTriggeringOffset-r16*,

\- $\mu_{\text{CSIRS}}$ and $\mu_{\text{PDCCH}}$ are the subcarrier
spacing configurations for CSI-RS and PDCCH, respectively,

\- $N_{\text{slot,\ offset,\ }\text{PDCCH}}^{\text{CA}}$
and $\mu_{\text{offset}\text{,}\text{PDCCH}}$are
the$\text{\ N}_{\text{slot,\ offset}}^{\text{CA}}$ and the,
respectively, which are determined by higher-layer configured
*ca-SlotOffset* for the cell receiving the PDCCH
respectively, $N_{\text{slot,\ offset,\ }\text{CSIRS}}^{\text{CA}}\ $and

the aperiodic CSI RS, if the CSI-RS starts no earlier than the first
symbol of the CSI-RS carrier\'s slot that starts at least *Ncsirs* PDCCH
symbols after the end of the PDCCH triggering the aperiodic CSI-RS.

When the triggering PDCCH and the triggered aperiodic CSI-RS are of
different numerologies, the CSI request constraint and CSI reporting
constraint defined in 5.2.1.5.1 for the case where the numerologies are
the same applies with the following additions:

\- CSI request constraints:

\- A UE is not expected to receive more than one CSI request per
reference slot length across all CCs in a cell group, where the SCS of
the reference slot is the minimum of SCS of the PDCCH with which the DCI
was transmitted, the SCS of the PUSCH with which the CSI report is to be
transmitted, and the SCS of the minimum SCS of the CSI-RS associated to
the CSI reports triggered by the DCI. The beginning of a slot length is
defined according the PDCCH cell with which the DCI carrying the CSI
request is transmitted.

\- CSI reporting constraints:

\- A UE is not expected to receive more than one CSI request for
transmission in a given reference slot length across all CCs in a cell
group, where the SCS of the reference slot is the minimum of SCS of the
PDCCH with which the DCI was transmitted, the SCS of the PUSCH with
which the CSI report is to be transmitted, and the SCS of the minimum
SCS of the CSI-RS associated to the CSI reports triggered by the DCI.
The beginning of a slot length is defined according the PUSCH cell with
which the CSI report is transmitted.

##### 5.2.1.5.2 Semi-persistent CSI/Semi-persistent CSI-RS

For semi-persistent reporting on PUSCH, a set of trigger states are
higher layer configured by *CSI-SemiPersistentOnPUSCH-TriggerStateList,*
where the CSI request field in DCI scrambled with SP-CSI-RNTI activates
one of the trigger states. A UE is not expected to receive a DCI
scrambled with SP-CSI-RNTI activating one semi-persistent CSI report
with the same *CSI-ReportConfigId* as in a semi-persistent CSI report
which is activated by a previously received DCI scrambled with
SP-CSI-RNTI.

For semi-persistent reporting on PUCCH, the PUCCH resource used for
transmitting the CSI report are configured by *reportConfigType*.
Semi-persistent reporting on PUCCH is activated by an activation command
as described in clause 6.1.3.16 of \[10, TS 38.321\], which selects one
of the semi-persistent Reporting Settings for use by the UE on the
PUCCH. When the UE would transmit a PUCCH with HARQ-ACK information in
slot *n* corresponding to the PDSCH carrying the activation command, the
indicated semi-persistent Reporting Setting should be applied starting
from the first slot that is after slot
$n + {3N}_{\text{slot}}^{subframe,µ}$ where *μ* is the SCS configuration
for the PUCCH.

For a UE configured with CSI resource setting(s) where the higher layer
parameter *resourceType* set to \'semiPersistent\'.

\- when a UE receives an activation command, as described in clause
6.1.3.12 of \[10, TS 38.321\], for CSI-RS resource set(s) for channel
measurement and CSI-IM/NZP CSI-RS resource set(s) for interference
measurement associated with configured CSI resource setting(s), and when
the UE would transmit a PUCCH with HARQ-ACK information in slot *n*
corresponding to the PDSCH carrying the selection command, the
corresponding actions in \[10, TS 38.321\] and the UE assumptions
(including QCL assumptions provided by a list of reference to
*TCI-State\'s,* one per activated resource) on CSI-RS/CSI-IM
transmission corresponding to the configured CSI-RS/CSI-IM resource
configuration(s) shall be applied starting from the first slot that is
after slot $n + {3N}_{\text{slot}}^{subframe,µ}$ where *μ* is the SCS
configuration for the PUCCH. If a *TCI-State* referred to in the list is
configured with a reference to an RS configured with *qcl-Type* set to
\'*typeD*\', that RS can be an SS/PBCH block, periodic or
semi-persistent CSI-RS located in same or different CC/DL BWP.

\- when a UE receives a deactivation command, as described in clause
6.1.3.12 of \[10, TS 38.321\], for activated CSI-RS/CSI-IM resource
set(s) associated with configured CSI resource setting(s), and when the
UE would transmit a PUCCH with HARQ-ACK information in slot *n*
corresponding to the PDSCH carrying the deactivation command, the
corresponding actions in \[10, TS 38.321\] and UE assumption on
cessation of CSI-RS/CSI-IM transmission corresponding to the deactivated
CSI-RS/CSI-IM resource set(s) shall apply starting from the first slot
that is after slot $n + {3N}_{\text{slot}}^{subframe,µ}$ where *μ* is
the SCS configuration for the PUCCH.

A codepoint of the CSI request field in the DCI is mapped to a SP-CSI
triggering state according to the order of the positions of the
configured trigger states in
*CSI-SemiPersistentOnPUSCH-TriggerStateList*, with codepoint \'0\'
mapped to the triggering state in the first position. A UE validates,
for semi-persistent CSI activation or release, a PDCCH on a DCI only if
the following conditions are met:

> \- the CRC parity bits of the DCI format are scrambled with a
> SP-CSI-RNTI provided by higher layer parameter *sp-CSI-RNTI*

\- Special fields for the DCI format are set according to Table
5.2.1.5.2-1 or Table 5.2.1.5.2-2.

If validation is achieved, the UE considers the information in the DCI
format as a valid activation or valid release of semi-persistent CSI
transmission on PUSCH, and the UE activates or deactivates a CSI
Reporting Setting indicated by CSI request field in the DCI. If
validation is not achieved, the UE considers the DCI format as having
been detected with a non-matching CRC.

+------------------------------+--------------------------------------+

If the UE has an active semi-persistent CSI-RS/CSI-IM resource
configuration, or an active semi-persistent ZP CSI-RS resource set
configuration, and has not received a deactivation command, the
activated semi-persistent CSI-RS/CSI-IM resource set or the activated
semi-persistent ZP CSI-RS resource set configurations are considered to
be active when the corresponding DL BWP is active, otherwise they are
considered suspended.

If the UE is configured with carrier deactivation, the following
configurations in the carrier in activated state would also be
deactivated and need re-activation configuration(s): semi-persistent
CSI-RS/CSI- IM resource, semi-persistent CSI reporting on PUCCH,
semi-persistent SRS, semi-persistent ZP CSI-RS resource set.

#### 5.2.1.6 CSI processing criteria

The UE indicates the number of supported simultaneous CSI calculations
$N_{\text{CPU}}$ with parameter *simultaneousCSI-ReportsPerCC* in a
component carrier, and *simultaneousCSI-ReportsAllCC* across all
component carriers. If a UE supports $N_{\text{CPU}}$ simultaneous CSI
calculations it is said to have $N_{\text{CPU}}$ CSI processing units
for processing CSI reports. If *L* CPUs are occupied for calculation of
CSI reports in a given OFDM symbol, the UE has $N_{\text{CPU}} - L$
unoccupied CPUs. If *N* CSI reports start occupying their respective
CPUs on the same OFDM symbol on which $N_{\text{CPU}} - L$ CPUs are
unoccupied, where each CSI report $n = 0,\ \ldots,\ N - 1$ corresponds
to $O_{\text{CPU}}^{(n)}$, the UE is not required to update the $N - M$
requested CSI reports with lowest priority (according to Clause 5.2.5),
where $0 \leq M \leq N\ $is the largest value such that
$\sum_{n = 0}^{M - 1}O_{\text{CPU}}^{(n)} \leq N_{\text{CPU}} - L\ $
holds.

A UE is not expected to be configured with an aperiodic CSI trigger
state containing more than $N_{\text{CPU}}$ Reporting Settings.
Processing of a CSI report occupies a number of CPUs for a number of
symbols as follows:

\- $O_{\text{CPU}} = 0\ \ $for a CSI report with CSI-ReportConfig with
higher layer parameter *reportQuantity* set to \'none\' and
*CSI-RS-ResourceSet* with higher layer parameter *trs-Info* configured

\- $O_{\text{CPU}} = 1\ $ for a CSI report with *CSI-ReportConfig* with
higher layer parameter *reportQuantity* set to \'cri-RSRP\',
\'ssb-Index-RSRP\', \'cri-SINR\', \'ssb-Index-SINR\' or \'none\' (and
*CSI-RS-ResourceSet* with higher layer parameter *trs-Info* not
configured)

\- for a CSI report with *CSI-ReportConfig* with higher layer parameter
*reportQuantity* set to \'cri-RI-PMI-CQI\', \'cri-RI-i1\',
\'cri-RI-i1-CQI\', \'cri-RI-CQI\', or \'cri-RI-LI-PMI-CQI\',

\- if a CSI report is aperiodically triggered without transmitting a
PUSCH with either transport block or HARQ-ACK or both when *L* = 0 CPUs
are occupied, where the CSI corresponds to a single CSI with wideband
frequency-granularity and to at most 4 CSI-RS ports in a single resource
without CRI report and where *codebookType* is set to
\'typeI-SinglePanel\' or where *reportQuantity* is set to
\'cri-RI-CQI\',
$O_{\text{CPU}} = N_{\text{CPU}}$$O_{\text{CPU}} = N_{\text{CPU}}$,

\- otherwise, $O_{\text{CPU}} = K_{s}$$O_{\text{CPU}} = K_{S}$, where
$K_{s}\ $$K_{s}\ $is the number of CSI-RS resources in the CSI-RS
resource set for channel measurement.

For a CSI report with *CSI-ReportConfig* with higher layer parameter
*reportQuantity* not set to \'none\', the CPU(s) are occupied for a
number of OFDM symbols as follows:

\- A periodic or semi-persistent CSI report (excluding an initial
semi-persistent CSI report on PUSCH after the PDCCH triggering the
report) occupies CPU(s) from the first symbol of the earliest one of
each CSI-RS/CSI-IM/SSB resource for channel or interference measurement,
respective latest CSI-RS/CSI-IM/SSB occasion no later than the
corresponding CSI reference resource, until the last symbol of the
configured PUSCH/PUCCH carrying the report.

\- An aperiodic CSI report occupies CPU(s) from the first symbol after
the PDCCH triggering the CSI report until the last symbol of the
scheduled PUSCH carrying the report.

\- An initial semi-persistent CSI report on PUSCH after the PDCCH
trigger occupies CPU(s) from the first symbol after the PDCCH until the
last symbol of the scheduled PUSCH carrying the report.

For a CSI report with *CSI-ReportConfig* with higher layer parameter
*reportQuantity* set to \'none\' and *CSI-RS-ResourceSet* with higher
layer parameter *trs-Info* not configured, the CPU(s) are occupied for a
number of OFDM symbols as follows:

\- A semi-persistent CSI report (excluding an initial semi-persistent
CSI report on PUSCH after the PDCCH triggering the report) occupies
CPU(s) from the first symbol of the earliest one of each transmission
occasion of periodic or semi-persistent CSI-RS/SSB resource for channel
measurement for L1-RSRP computation, until $Z_{3}^{'}$ symbols after the
last symbol of the latest one of the CSI-RS/SSB resource for channel
measurement for L1-RSRP computation in each transmission occasion.

\- An aperiodic CSI report occupies CPU(s) from the first symbol after
the PDCCH triggering the CSI report until the last symbol between
$Z_{3}$ symbols after the first symbol after the PDCCH triggering the
CSI report and $Z_{3}^{'}$ symbols after the last symbol of the latest
one of each CSI-RS/SSB resource for channel measurement for L1-RSRP
computation.

where $(Z_{3},Z_{3}^{'})$ are defined in the table 5.4-2.

In any slot, the UE is not expected to have more active CSI-RS ports or
active CSI-RS resources in active BWPs than reported as capability. NZP
CSI-RS resource is active in a duration of time defined as follows. For
aperiodic CSI-RS, starting from the end of the PDCCH containing the
request and ending at the end of the scheduled PUSCH containing the
report associated with this aperiodic CSI-RS. For semi-persistent
CSI-RS, starting from the end of when the activation command is applied,
and ending at the end of when the deactivation command is applied. For
periodic CSI-RS, starting when the periodic CSI-RS is configured by
higher layer signalling, and ending when the periodic CSI-RS
configuration is released. If a CSI-RS resource is referred *N* times by
one or more CSI Reporting Settings, the CSI-RS resource and the CSI-RS
ports within the CSI-RS resource are counted *N* times.

### 5.2.2 Channel state information

#### 5.2.2.1 Channel quality indicator (CQI) 

The CQI indices and their interpretations are given in Table 5.2.2.1-2
or Table 5.2.2.1-4 for reporting CQI based on QPSK, 16QAM and 64QAM. The
CQI indices and their interpretations are given in Table 5.2.2.1-3 for
reporting CQI based on QPSK, 16QAM, 64QAM and 256QAM.

Based on an unrestricted observation interval in time unless specified
otherwise in this Clause, and an unrestricted observation interval in
frequency, the UE shall derive for each CQI value reported in uplink
slot *n* the highest CQI index which satisfies the following condition:

\- A single PDSCH transport block with a combination of modulation
scheme, target code rate and transport block size corresponding to the
CQI index, and occupying a group of downlink physical resource blocks
termed the CSI reference resource, could be received with a transport
block error probability not exceeding:

\- 0.1, if the higher layer parameter *cqi-Table* in *CSI-ReportConfig*
configures \'table1\' (corresponding to Table 5.2.2.1-2), or \'table2\'
(corresponding to Table 5.2.2.1-3), or

\- 0.00001, if the higher layer parameter *cqi-Table* in
*CSI-ReportConfig* configures \'table3\' (corresponding to Table
5.2.2.1-4).

If the higher layer parameter *timeRestrictionForChannelMeasurements* is
set to \"*notConfigured*\", the UE shall derive the channel measurements
for computing CSI value reported in uplink slot *n* based on only the
NZP CSI-RS, no later than the CSI reference resource, (defined in TS
38.211\[4\]) associated with the CSI resource setting.

If the higher layer parameter *timeRestrictionForChannelMeasurements* in
*CSI-ReportConfig* is set to \"*Configured*\", the UE shall derive the
channel measurements for computing CSI reported in uplink slot *n* based
on only the most recent, no later than the CSI reference resource,
occasion of NZP CSI-RS (defined in \[4, TS 38.211\]) associated with the
CSI resource setting.

If the higher layer parameter
*timeRestrictionForInterferenceMeasurements* is set to
\"*notConfigured*\", the UE shall derive the interference measurements
for computing CSI value reported in uplink slot *n* based on only the
CSI-IM and/or NZP CSI-RS for interference measurement no later than the
CSI reference resource associated with the CSI resource setting.

If the higher layer parameter
*timeRestrictionForInterferenceMeasurements* in *CSI-ReportConfig* is
set to \"*Configured*\", the UE shall derive the interference
measurements for computing the CSI value reported in uplink slot *n*
based on the most recent, no later than the CSI reference resource,
occasion of CSI-IM and/or NZP CSI-RS for interference measurement
(defined in \[4, TS 38.211\]) associated with the CSI resource setting.

For each sub-band index *s,* a 2-bit sub-band differential CQI is
defined as:

\- Sub-band Offset level (*s*) = sub-band CQI index (*s*) - wideband CQI
index.

The mapping from the 2-bit sub-band differential CQI values to the
offset level is shown in Table 5.2.2.1-1

Table 5.2.2.1-1: Mapping sub-band differential CQI value to offset level

  Sub-band differential CQI value   Offset level
  --------------------------------- --------------
  0                                 0
  1                                 1
  2                                 ≥ 2
  3                                 ≤-1

A combination of modulation scheme and transport block size corresponds
to a CQI index if:

\- the combination could be signaled for transmission on the PDSCH in
the CSI reference resource according to the Transport Block Size
determination described in Clause 5.1.3.2, and

\- the modulation scheme is indicated by the CQI index, and

\- the combination of transport block size and modulation scheme when
applied to the reference resource results in the effective channel code
rate which is the closest possible to the code rate indicated by the CQI
index. If more than one combination of transport block size and
modulation scheme results in an effective channel code rate equally
close to the code rate indicated by the CQI index, only the combination
with the smallest of such transport block sizes is relevant.

one precoding matrix is indicated by the PMI corresponding to the last
subband. If

The precoding matrices indicated by the PMI are determined from
$L + M_{\upsilon}$ vectors.

$L$ vectors,
$v_{m_{1}^{\left( i \right)},m_{2}^{(i)}},i = 0,1,\ldots,L - 1$, are
identified by the indices $q_{1},q_{2},\ n_{1}$, $n_{2}$, indicated by
$i_{1,1}$, $i_{1,2}$, obtained as in 5.2.2.2.3, where the values of
$C\left( x,y \right)$ are given in Table 5.2.2.2.5-4.

$M_{\upsilon} = \left\lceil p_{\upsilon}\frac{N_{3}}{R} \right\rceil$
vectors,
$\left\lbrack y_{0,l}^{\left( f \right)},y_{1,l}^{\left( f \right)},\ldots,y_{N_{3} - 1,l}^{\left( f \right)} \right\rbrack^{T}$,
$f = 0,1,\ldots,M_{\upsilon} - 1$, are identified by
$M_{\text{initial}}$ (for $N_{3} > 19$) and
$n_{3,l}\ \left( l = 1,\ldots,\ \upsilon \right)\ $where

$$M_{\text{initial}} \in \left\{ - 2M_{\upsilon} + 1, - 2M_{\upsilon} + 2,\ldots,0 \right\}$$

$$n_{3,l} = \left\lbrack n_{3,l}^{(0)},\ldots,n_{3,l}^{(M_{\upsilon} - 1)} \right\rbrack$$

$${\ n}_{3,l}^{\left( f \right)} \in \left\{ 0,1,\ldots,N_{3} - 1 \right\}$$

which are indicated by means of the indices $i_{1,5}$ (for $N_{3} > 19$)
and $i_{1,6,l}$
$\left( \text{for\ }M_{\upsilon} > 1\text{\ and\ }l = 1,\ldots,\ \upsilon \right)$,
where

$$i_{1,5} \in \left\{ 0,1,\ldots,2M_{\upsilon} - 1 \right\}$$

$${\ i}_{1,6,l} \in \left\{ \begin{matrix}
\left\{ 0,1,\ldots,\begin{pmatrix}
N_{3} - 1 \\
M_{\upsilon} - 1 \\
\end{pmatrix} - 1 \right\} & N_{3} \leq 19 \\
\left\{ 0,1,\ldots,\begin{pmatrix}
2M_{\upsilon} - 1 \\
M_{\upsilon} - 1 \\
\end{pmatrix} - 1 \right\} & N_{3} > 19 \\
\end{matrix} \right.\ $$

The amplitude coefficient indicators $i_{2,3,l}$ and $i_{2,4,l}$ are

$$i_{2,3,l} = \begin{bmatrix}
k_{l,0}^{\left( 1 \right)} & k_{l,1}^{\left( 1 \right)} \\
\end{bmatrix}$$

$$i_{2,4,l} = \left\lbrack k_{l,0}^{(2)}\ldots k_{l,M_{\upsilon} - 1}^{(2)} \right\rbrack$$

$$k_{l,f}^{(2)} = \left\lbrack k_{l,0,f}^{(2)}\ldots k_{l,2L - 1,f}^{(2)} \right\rbrack$$

$$k_{l,p}^{(1)} \in \left\{ 1,\ldots,15 \right\}$$

$$k_{l,i,f}^{(2)} \in \left\{ 0,\ldots,7 \right\}$$

for $l = 1,\ldots,\upsilon$.

The phase coefficient indicator $i_{2,5,l}\ $is

$$i_{2,5,l} = \left\lbrack c_{l,0}\ldots c_{l,M_{\upsilon} - 1} \right\rbrack$$

$$c_{l,f} = \left\lbrack c_{l,0,f}\ldots c_{l,2L - 1,f} \right\rbrack$$

$$c_{l,i,f} \in \left\{ 0,\ldots,15 \right\}$$

for $l = 1,\ldots,\upsilon.$

Let $K_{0} = \left\lceil \beta 2LM_{1} \right\rceil$. The bitmap whose
nonzero bits identify which coefficients in $i_{2,4,l}$ and
$i_{2,5,l}\ $are reported, is indicated by $i_{1,7,l}$

$$i_{1,7,l} = \left\lbrack k_{l,0}^{\left( 3 \right)}\ldots k_{l,M_{\upsilon} - 1}^{\left( 3 \right)} \right\rbrack$$

$$k_{l,f}^{\left( 3 \right)} = \left\lbrack k_{l,0,f}^{\left( 3 \right)}\ldots k_{l,2L - 1,f}^{\left( 3 \right)} \right\rbrack$$

$$k_{l,i,f}^{(3)} \in \left\{ 0,1 \right\}$$

for $l = 1,\ldots,\upsilon$, such that
$K_{l}^{\text{NZ}} = \sum_{i = 0}^{2L - 1}{\sum_{f = 0}^{M_{\upsilon} - 1}k_{l,i,f}^{(3)}} \leq K_{0}$
is the number of nonzero coefficients for layer $l = 1,\ldots,\upsilon$
and
$K^{\text{NZ}} = \sum_{l = 1}^{\upsilon}K_{l}^{\text{NZ}} \leq 2K_{0}$
is the total number of nonzero coefficients.

The indices of $i_{2,4,l}$, $i_{2,5,l}$ and $i_{1,7,l}$ are associated
to the $M_{\upsilon}$ codebook indices in $n_{3,l}$.

The mapping from $k_{l,p}^{(1)}$ to the amplitude coefficient
$p_{l,p}^{(1)}$ is given in Table 5.2.2.2.5-2 and the mapping from
$k_{l,i,f}^{(2)}$ to the amplitude coefficient $p_{l,i,f}^{(2)}$ is
given in Table 5.2.2.2.5-3. The amplitude coefficients are represented
by

$$p_{l}^{\left( 1 \right)} = \begin{bmatrix}
p_{l,0}^{\left( 1 \right)} & p_{l,1}^{\left( 1 \right)} \\
\end{bmatrix}$$

$$p_{l}^{(2)} = \left\lbrack p_{l,0}^{(2)}\ldots p_{l,M_{\upsilon} - 1}^{(2)} \right\rbrack$$

$$p_{l,f}^{(2)} = \left\lbrack p_{l,0,f}^{(2)}\ldots p_{l,2L - 1,f}^{(2)} \right\rbrack$$

for$\ l = 1,\ldots,\upsilon$.

Let $f_{l}^{*} \in \left\{ 0,1,\ldots,M_{\upsilon} - 1 \right\}$ be the
index of $i_{2,4,l}$ and
$i_{l}^{*} \in \left\{ 0,1,\ldots,2L - 1 \right\}$ be the index of
$k_{l,f_{l}^{*}}^{(2)}$ which identify the strongest coefficient of
layer $l$, i.e., the element $k_{l,i_{l}^{*},f_{l}^{*}}^{(2)}$ of
$i_{2,4,l}$, for $\text{\ l} = 1,\ldots,\upsilon$. The codebook indices
of $n_{3,l}$$k_{m_{i}}$ are remapped with respect to
$n_{3,l}^{(f_{l}^{*})}$ as
$n_{3,l}^{(f)} = \left( n_{3,l}^{(f)} - n_{3,l}^{(f_{l}^{*})} \right)\text{mod\ }N_{3}$${\widetilde{k}}_{m_{i}^{*}} = 0$,
such that $n_{3,l}^{(f_{l}^{*})} = 0$, after remapping. The index $f$ is
remapped with respect to $f_{l}^{*}$ as
$f = \left( f - f_{l}^{*} \right)\text{mod\ }M_{\upsilon}$, such that
the index of the strongest coefficient is $f_{l}^{*} = 0$
($l = 1,\ldots,\upsilon$), after remapping. The indices of $i_{2,4,l}$,
$i_{2,5,l}$ and $i_{1,7,l}$ indicate amplitude coefficients, phase
coefficients and bitmap after remapping.

The strongest coefficient of layer $l$ is identified by
$i_{1,8,l} \in \left\{ 0,1,\ldots,2L - 1 \right\}$, which is obtained as
follows

$i_{1,8,l} = \left\{ \begin{matrix}
\sum_{i = 0}^{i_{1}^{*}}k_{1,i,0}^{(3)} - 1 & \upsilon\mathbf{=}1 \\
i_{l}^{*} & 1 < \upsilon\mathbf{\leq}4 \\
\end{matrix} \right.\ \ $

for $l = 1,\ldots,\ \upsilon$.

When $n_{3,l}$ and $M_{\text{initial}}$ are known, $i_{1,5}\ $and
$i_{1,6,l}\ (l = 1,\ldots,\upsilon)$ are found as follows:

\- If $N_{3} \leq 19$, $i_{1,5} = 0$ and is not reported. If
$M_{\nu} = 1$, $i_{1,6,l} = 0$, for $l = 1,\ldots,\nu$, and is not
reported. If $M_{\nu} > 1$,
$i_{1,6,l} = \sum_{f = 1}^{M_{\upsilon} - 1}{C\left( N_{3} - 1 - n_{3,l}^{\left( f \right)},M_{\upsilon} - f \right)}$,
where $C\left( x,y \right)$ is given in Table 5.2.2.2.5-4 and where the
indices $f = 1,\ldots,M_{\upsilon} - 1$ are assigned such that
$n_{3,l}^{(f)}$ increases as $f$ increases.

\- If $N_{3} > 19$, $M_{\text{initial}}$ is indicated by $i_{1,5}$,
which is reported and given by

$i_{1,5} = \left\{ \begin{matrix}
M_{\text{initial}} & M_{\text{initial}} = 0\  \\
M_{\text{initial}} + 2M_{\upsilon} & M_{\text{initial}} < 0 \\
\end{matrix} \right.\ $

Only the nonzero indices $n_{3,l}^{(f)} \in IntS$,
where$\ IntS = \{\left( M_{\text{initial}} + i \right)\ \text{mod}\ N_{3},\ i = 0,1,\ldots,2M_{\upsilon} - 1\}$,
are reported, where the indices $f = 1,\ldots,M_{\upsilon} - 1$ are
assigned such that $n_{3,l}^{(f)}$ increases as $f$ increases. Let

$n_{l}^{(f)} = \left\{ \begin{matrix}
n_{3,l}^{\left( f \right)} & \ n_{3,l}^{\left( f \right)} \leq M_{\text{initial}} + 2M_{\upsilon} - 1\  \\
n_{3,l}^{\left( f \right)} - (N_{3} - 2M_{\upsilon}) & n_{3,l}^{\left( f \right)} > M_{\text{initial}} + N_{3} - \ 1 \\
\end{matrix} \right.\ ,$

then
$i_{1,6,l} = \sum_{f = 1}^{M_{\upsilon} - 1}{C\left( 2M_{\upsilon} - 1 - n_{l}^{\left( f \right)},M_{\upsilon} - f \right)}$,
where $C\left( x,y \right)$ is given in Table 5.2.2.2.5-4.

The codebooks for 1-4 layers are given in Table 5.2.2.2.5-5, where
$m_{1}^{(i)}$, $m_{2}^{(i)}$, for $i = 0,1,\ldots,L - 1,$
$v_{m_{1}^{\left( i \right)},m_{2}^{(i)}}\ $ are obtained as in clause
5.2.2.2.3, and the quantities $\varphi_{l,i,f}$ and $y_{t,l}\ $are given
by

$$\varphi_{l,i,f} = \ e^{j\frac{2\pi c_{l,i,f}}{16}}$$

$$y_{t,l} = \left\lbrack y_{t,l}^{(0)}\text{\ \ \ \ }y_{t,l}^{(1)}\ \ \ \ldots\ \ \ \ y_{t,l}^{(M_{\upsilon} - 1)} \right\rbrack$$

where $t = \left\{ 0,1,\ldots,N_{3} - 1 \right\}$, is the index
associated with the precoding matrix,
$l = \left\{ 1,\ldots,\ \upsilon \right\}$, and with

${y_{t,l}^{(f)} = e}^{j\frac{2\pi tn_{3,l}^{(f)}}{N_{3}}}\text{\ \ \ }$

for$\ f = 0,1,\ldots,M_{\upsilon} - 1$.

For coefficients with $k_{l,i,f}^{(3)} = 0$, amplitude and phase are set
to zero, i.e., $p_{l,i,f}^{(2)} = 0$ and $\varphi_{l,i,f} = 0$.

The bitmap parameter *typeII-RI‑Restriction-r16* forms the bit sequence
$r_{3},r_{2},r_{1},r_{0}$ where $r_{0}$ is the LSB and $r_{3}$ is the
MSB. When $r_{i}$ is zero, $i \in \left\{ 0,1,\ldots,3 \right\}$, PMI
and RI reporting are not allowed to correspond to any precoder
associated with $\upsilon = i + 1$ layers.

The bitmap parameter *n1-n2‑codebookSubsetRestriction-r16* forms the bit
sequence $B = B_{1}B_{2}$ and configures the vector group indices
$g^{(k)}$ as in clause 5.2.2.2.3. Bits
$b_{2}^{\left( k,{2(N}_{1}x_{2} + x_{1} \right) + 1)}b_{2}^{\left( k,{2(N}_{1}x_{2} + x_{1} \right))}$
indicate the maximum allowed average amplitude, $\gamma_{i + pL}$
($p = 0,1$), with $i \in \{ 0,1,\ldots,L - 1\}$, of the coefficients
associated with the vector in group $g^{(k)}$ indexed by $x_{1},x_{2}$,
where the maximum amplitudes are given in Table 5.2.2.2.5-6 and the
average coefficient amplitude is restricted as follows

$\sqrt{\frac{1}{\sum_{f = 0}^{M_{\upsilon} - 1}k_{l,i + \text{pL},f}^{(3)}}\sum_{f = 0}^{M_{\upsilon} - 1}{k_{l,i + \text{pL},f}^{(3)}\left( p_{l,p}^{\left( 1 \right)}p_{l,i + \text{pL},f}^{\left( 2 \right)} \right)^{2}}} \leq \gamma_{i + \text{pL}}$

for $l = 1,\ldots,\upsilon$, and $p = 0,1$. A UE that does not report
the parameter *amplitudeSubsetRestriction-r16* = \'supported\' in its
capability signaling is not expected to be configured with
$b_{2}^{\left( k,{2(N}_{1}x_{2} + x_{1} \right) + 1)}b_{2}^{\left( k,{2(N}_{1}x_{2} + x_{1} \right))} = 01$

\- The UE shall report the RI value $\upsilon$ according to the
configured higher layer parameter
*typeII-PortSelectionRI-Restriction-r16*. The UE shall not report
$\upsilon > 4$.

\- The value of $R$ is configured as in Clause 5.2.2.2.5.

The UE is also configured with the higher layer bitmap parameter
*typeII-PortSelectionRI-Restriction-r16*, which forms the bit sequence
$r_{3},r_{2},r_{1},r_{0}$, where $r_{0}\ $is the LSB and $r_{3}$ is the

#### 5.2.2.3 Reference signal (CSI-RS) 

##### 5.2.2.3.1 NZP CSI-RS

The UE can be configured with one or more NZP CSI-RS resource set
configuration(s) as indicated by the higher layer parameters
*CSI-ResourceConfig, and NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet.* Each NZP CSI-RS
resource set consists of *K*≥1 NZP CSI-RS resource(s).

The following parameters for which the UE shall assume non-zero
transmission power for CSI-RS resource are configured via the higher
layer parameter *NZP-CSI-RS-Resource, CSI-ResourceConfig* and
*NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet* for each CSI-RS resource configuration:

*- nzp-CSI-RS-ResourceId determines CSI-RS resource configuration
identity.*

*- periodicityAndOffset defines the CSI-RS periodicity and slot offset
for periodic/semi-persistent CSI-RS. All the CSI-RS resources within one
set are configured with the same periodicity, while the slot offset can
be same or different for different CSI-RS resources.*

*- resourceMapping defines t*he number of ports, CDM-type, and OFDM
symbol and subcarrier occupancy of the CSI-RS resource within a slot
that are given in Clause 7.4.1.5 of \[4, TS 38.211\].

*- nrofPorts* in *resourceMapping* *defines the number of CSI-RS ports,
where the allowable values are given in* Clause 7.4.1.5 of \[4, TS
38.211\].

*- density in resourceMapping* *defines CSI-RS frequency density of each
CSI-RS port per PRB*, *and CSI-RS PRB offset in case of the density
value of 1/2,* where the *allowable values are given in* Clause 7.4.1.5
of \[4, TS 38.211\]. For density 1/2, the odd/even PRB allocation
indicated in *density* is with respect to the common resource block
grid.

*- cdm-Type* *in resourceMapping* *defines CDM values and pattern, where
the allowable values are given in Clause 7.4.1.5 of \[4, TS 38.211\].*

*- powerControlOffset: which is the assumed ratio of PDSCH EPRE to* NZP
*CSI-RS EPRE when UE derives CSI feedback and takes values in the range
of \[-8, 15\] dB with 1 dB step size.*

*- powerControlOffsetSS: which is the assumed ratio of* NZP *CSI-RS EPRE
to SS/PBCH block EPRE.*

*- scramblingID defines scrambling ID of CSI-RS with length of 10 bits.*

*- BWP-Id in CSI-ResourceConfig defines which bandwidth part the
configured CSI-RS is located in.*

\- *repetition* in *NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet* is associated with a CSI-RS
resource set and defines whether UE can assume the CSI-RS resources
within the NZP CSI-RS Resource Set are transmitted with the same
downlink spatial domain transmission filter or not as described in
Clause 5.1.6.1.2. and can be configured only when the higher layer
parameter *reportQuantity* associated with all the reporting settings
linked with the CSI-RS resource set is set to \'cri-RSRP\', \'cri-SINR\'
or \'none\'.

\- *qcl-InfoPeriodicCSI-RS* contains a reference to a *TCI-State*
indicating QCL source RS(s) and QCL type(s). If the *TCI-State* is
configured with a reference to an RS configured with *qcl-Type* set to
\'typeD\' association, that RS may be an SS/PBCH block located in the
same or different CC/DL BWP or a CSI-RS resource configured as periodic
located in the same or different CC/DL BWP.

\- *trs-Info* in *NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet* is associated with a CSI-RS
resource set and for which the UE can assume that the antenna port with
the same port index of the configured NZP CSI-RS resources in the
*NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet* is the same as described in Clause 5.1.6.1.1
and can be configured when reporting setting is not configured or when
the higher layer parameter *reportQuantity* associated with all the
reporting settings linked with the CSI-RS resource set is set to
\'none\'.

All CSI-RS resources within one set are configured with same *density*
and same *nrofPorts*, except for the NZP CSI-RS resources used for
interference measurement.

The UE expects that all the CSI-RS resources of a resource set are
configured with the same starting RB and number of RBs and the same
*cdm-type*.

The bandwidth and initial common resource block (CRB) index of a CSI-RS
resource within a BWP, as defined in Clause 7.4.1.5 of \[4, TS 38.211\],
are determined based on the higher layer parameters *nrofRBs* and
*startingRB*, respectively, within the CSI-FrequencyOccupation IE
configured by the higher layer parameter *freqBand* within the
*CSI-RS-ResourceMapping* IE. Both *nrofRBs* and *startingRB* are
configured as integer multiples of 4 RBs, and the reference point for
*startingRB* is CRB 0 on the common resource block grid. If
$\text{startingRB} < N_{\text{BWP}}^{\text{start}},$ the UE shall assume
that the initial CRB index of the CSI-RS resource is
$N_{\text{initial}\ \text{RB}} = N_{\text{BWP}}^{\text{start}}$,
otherwise $N_{\text{initial}\ \text{RB}} = \text{startingRB}$. If
$\text{nrofRBs} > N_{\text{BWP}}^{\text{size}} + N_{\text{BWP}}^{\text{start}} - N_{\text{initial}\ \text{RB}}$,
the UE shall assume that the bandwidth of the CSI-RS resource is
$N_{\text{CSI} - \text{RS}}^{\text{BW}} = N_{\text{BWP}}^{\text{size}} + N_{\text{BWP}}^{\text{start}} - N_{\text{initial}\ \text{RB}}$,
otherwise $N_{\text{CSI} - \text{RS}}^{\text{BW}} = \text{nrofRBs}$. In
all cases, the UE shall expect that
$N_{\text{CSI} - \text{RS}}^{\text{BW}} \geq min(24,\ N_{\text{BWP}}^{\text{size}})$.

#### 5.2.2.4 Channel State Information -- Interference Measurement (CSI-IM) 

The UE can be configured with one or more CSI-IM resource set
configuration(s) as indicated by the higher layer parameter
*CSI-IM-ResourceSet*. Each CSI-IM resource set consists of *K*≥1 CSI-IM
resource(s).

The following parameters are configured via higher layer parameter
*CSI-IM-Resource* for each CSI-IM resource configuration:

*- csi-IM-ResourceId* determines CSI-IM resource configuration identity

*- subcarrierLocation-p0* or *subcarrierLocation-p1* defines subcarrier
occupancy of the CSI-IM resource within a slot for
*csi-IM-ResourceElementPattern* set to \'pattern0\' or \'pattern1\',
respectively.

*- symbolLocation-p0* or *symbolLocation-p1* defines OFDM symbol
location of the CSI-IM resource within a slot for
*csi-IM-ResourceElementPattern* set to \'pattern0\' or \'pattern1\',
respectively.

*- periodicityAndOffset* defines the CSI-IM periodicity and slot offset
for periodic/semi-persistent CSI-IM.

*-* f*reqBand* includes parameters to enable configuration of
frequency-occupancy of CSI-IM

In each of the PRBs configured by f*reqBand,* the UE shall assume each
CSI-IM resource is located in,

\- resource elements , , and , if *csi-IM-ResourceElementPattern* is set
to \'pattern0\',

\- resource elements , , and if *csi-IM-ResourceElementPattern* is set
to \'pattern1\',

where and are the configured frequency-domain location and time-domain
location, respectively, given by the higher layer parameters in the
above list.

#### 5.2.2.5 CSI reference resource definition

The CSI reference resource for a serving cell is defined as follows:

\- In the frequency domain, the CSI reference resource is defined by the
group of downlink physical resource blocks corresponding to the band to
which the derived CSI relates.

\- In the time domain, the CSI reference resource for a CSI reporting in
uplink slot *n\'* is defined by a single downlink slot
*n*-*n~CSI\_ref~*,

> \- where
> $+ \left\lfloor \left( \frac{N_{slot,offset,UL}^{\text{CA}}}{2^{\mu_{offset,UL}}} - \frac{N_{slot,offset,DL}^{\text{CA}}}{2^{\mu_{offset,DL}}} \right) \bullet 2^{\mu_{\text{DL}}} \right\rfloor\ $and
> and are the subcarrier spacing configurations for DL and UL,
> respectively, and $N_{\text{slot,\ offset}}^{\text{CA}}$ and are
> determined by higher-layer configured *ca-SlotOffset* for the cells
> transmitting the uplink and downlink, as defined in clause 4.5 of \[4,
> TS 38.211\]

\- where for periodic and semi-persistent CSI reporting

\- if a single CSI-RS/SSB resource is configured for channel measurement
*n~CSI\_ref~* is the smallest value greater than or equal to
$4 \cdot 2^{µ_{\text{DL}}}$, such that it corresponds to a valid
downlink slot, or

\- if multiple CSI-RS/SSB resources are configured for channel
measurement *n~CSI\_ref~* is the smallest value greater than or equal to
, such that it corresponds to a valid downlink slot.

\- where for aperiodic CSI reporting, if the UE is indicated by the DCI
to report CSI in the same slot as the CSI request, *n~CSI\_ref~* is such
that the reference resource is in the same valid downlink slot as the
corresponding CSI request, otherwise *n~CSI\_ref~* is the smallest value
greater than or equal to , such that slot *n*- *n~CSI\_ref~* corresponds
to a valid downlink slot, where *Z\'* corresponds to the delay
requirement as defined in Clause 5.4.

\- when periodic or semi-persistent CSI-RS/CSI-IM or SSB is used for
channel/interference measurements, the UE is not expected to measure
channel/interference on the CSI-RS/CSI-IM/SSB whose last OFDM symbol is
received up to *Z\'* symbols before transmission time of the first OFDM
symbol of the aperiodic CSI reporting.

A slot in a serving cell shall be considered to be a valid downlink slot
if:

\- it comprises at least one higher layer configured downlink or
flexible symbol, and

\- it does not fall within a configured measurement gap for that UE

If there is no valid downlink slot for the CSI reference resource
corresponding to a CSI Report Setting in a serving cell, CSI reporting
is omitted for the serving cell in uplink slot *n\'*.

After the CSI report (re)configuration, serving cell activation, BWP
change, or activation of SP-CSI, the UE reports a CSI report only after
receiving at least one CSI-RS transmission occasion for channel
measurement and CSI-RS and/or CSI-IM occasion for interference
measurement no later than CSI reference resource and drops the report
otherwise.

When DRX is configured, the UE reports a CSI report only if receiving at
least one CSI-RS transmission occasion for channel measurement and
CSI-RS and/or CSI-IM occasion for interference measurement in DRX Active
Time no later than CSI reference resource and drops the report
otherwise. When the UE is configured to monitor DCI format 2\_6 and if
the UE configured by higher layer parameter
*ps-TransmitOtherPeriodicCSI* to report CSI with the higher layer
parameter *reportConfigType* set to \'periodic\' and *reportQuantity*
set to quantities other than \'cri-RSRP\' and \'ssb-Index-RSRP\' when
*drx-onDurationTimer* is not started, the UE shall report CSI during the
time duration indicated by *drx-onDurationTimer* in *DRX-Config also
outside active time according to the procedure described in Clause
5.2.1.4* if receiving at least one CSI-RS transmission occasion for
channel measurement and CSI-RS and/or CSI-IM occasion for interference
measurement during the time duration indicated by *drx-onDurationTimer*
in *DRX-Config* outside DRX active time or in DRX Active Time [
]{.underline} no later than CSI reference resource and drops the report
otherwise. When the UE is configured to monitor DCI format 2\_6 and if
the UE configured by higher layer parameter *ps-TransmitPeriodicL1-RSRP*
to report L1-RSRP with the higher layer parameter *reportConfigType* set
to \'periodic\' and *reportQuantity* set to \'cri-RSRP\' or
\'ssb-Index-RSRP\' when *drx-onDurationTimer* is not started, the UE
shall report L1-RSRP during the time duration indicated by
*drx-onDurationTimer* in *DRX-Config* *also outside active time
according to the procedure described in clause 5.2.1.4* and when
*reportQuantity* set to \'*cri-RSRP\'* if receiving at least one CSI-RS
transmission occasion for channel measurement during the time duration
indicated by *drx-onDurationTimer* in *DRX-Config* outside DRX active
time or in DRX Active Time no later than CSI reference resource and
drops the report otherwise.

When deriving CSI feedback, the UE is not expected that a NZP CSI -RS
resource for channel measurement overlaps with CSI-IM resource for
interference measurement or NZP CSI -RS resource for interference
measurement.

If configured to report CQI index, in the CSI reference resource, the UE
shall assume the following for the purpose of deriving the CQI index,
and if also configured, for deriving PMI and RI:

\- The first 2 OFDM symbols are occupied by control signaling.

\- The number of PDSCH and DM-RS symbols is equal to 12.

\- The same bandwidth part subcarrier spacing configured as for the
PDSCH reception

\- The bandwidth as configured for the corresponding CQI report.

\- The reference resource uses the CP length and subcarrier spacing
configured for PDSCH reception

\- No resource elements used by primary or secondary synchronization
signals or PBCH.

\- Redundancy Version 0.

\- The ratio of PDSCH EPRE to CSI-RS EPRE is as given in Clause
5.2.2.3.1.

\- Assume no REs allocated for NZP CSI-RS and ZP CSI-RS.

\- Assume the same number of front-loaded DM-RS symbols as the maximum
front-loaded symbols configured by the higher layer parameter
*maxLength* in *DMRS-DownlinkConfig.*

\- Assume the same number of additional DM-RS symbols as the additional
symbols configured by the higher layer parameter
*dmrs-AdditionalPosition*.

\- Assume the PDSCH symbols are not containing DM-RS.

\- Assume PRB bundling size of 2 PRBs.

\- The PDSCH transmission scheme where the UE may assume that PDSCH
transmission would be performed with up to 8 transmission layers as
defined in Clause 7.3.1.4 of \[4, TS 38.211\]. For CQI calculation, the
UE should assume that PDSCH signals on antenna ports in the set
\[1000,..., 1000+ν-1\] for ν layers would result in signals equivalent
to corresponding symbols transmitted on antenna ports \[3000,...,
3000+*P*-1\], as given by

$\begin{bmatrix}
y^{\left( 3000 \right)}(i) \\
\cdots \\
y^{\left( 3000 + P - 1 \right)}(i) \\
\end{bmatrix} = W(i)\begin{bmatrix}
x^{\left( 0 \right)}(i) \\
\cdots \\
x^{\left( \nu - 1 \right)}(i) \\
\end{bmatrix}$

where is a vector of PDSCH symbols from the layer mapping defined in
Clause 7.3.1.4 of \[4, TS 38.211\], is the number of CSI-RS ports. If
only one CSI-RS port is configured, *W(i)* is 1. If the higher layer
parameter *reportQuantity* in *CSI-ReportConfig* for which the CQI is
reported is set to either \'cri-RI-PMI-CQI\' or \'cri-RI-LI-PMI-CQI\',
*W(i)* is the precoding matrix corresponding to the reported PMI
applicable to *x(i)*. If the higher layer parameter *reportQuantity* in
*CSI-ReportConfig* for which the CQI is reported is set to
\'cri-RI-CQI\', *W(i)* is the precoding matrix corresponding to the
procedure described in Clause 5.2.1.4.2. If the higher layer parameter
*reportQuantity* in *CSI-ReportConfig* for which the CQI is reported is
set to \'cri-RI-i1-CQI\', *W(i)* is the precoding matrix corresponding
to the reported i1 according to the procedure described in Clause
5.2.1.4.2*.*The corresponding PDSCH signals transmitted on antenna ports
\[3000,...,3000 + *P* - 1\] would have a ratio of EPRE to CSI-RS EPRE
equal to the ratio given in Clause 5.2.2.3.1.

### 5.2.3 CSI reporting using PUSCH

A UE shall perform aperiodic CSI reporting using PUSCH on serving cell c
upon successful decoding of a DCI format 0\_1 or DCI format 0\_2 which
triggers an aperiodic CSI trigger state.

When a DCI format 0\_1 schedules two PUSCH allocations, the aperiodic
CSI report is carried on the second scheduled PUSCH. When a DCI format
0\_1 schedules more than two PUSCH allocations, the aperiodic CSI report
is carried on the penultimate scheduled PUSCH.

An aperiodic CSI report carried on the PUSCH supports wideband, and
sub-band frequency granularities. An aperiodic CSI report carried on the
PUSCH supports Type I, Type II and Enhanced Type II CSI.

A UE shall perform semi-persistent CSI reporting on the PUSCH upon
successful decoding of a DCI format 0\_1 or DCI format 0\_2 which
activates a semi-persistent CSI trigger state. DCI format 0\_1 and DCI
format 0\_2 contains a CSI request field which indicates the
semi-persistent CSI trigger state to activate or deactivate.
Semi-persistent CSI reporting on the PUSCH supports Type I, Type II with
wideband, and sub-band frequency granularities and Enhanced Type II CSI.
The PUSCH resources and MCS shall be allocated semi-persistently by an
uplink DCI.

CSI reporting on PUSCH can be multiplexed with uplink data on PUSCH
except that semi-persistent CSI reporting on PUSCH activated by a DCI
format is not expected to be multiplexed with uplink data on the PUSCH.
CSI reporting on PUSCH can also be performed without any multiplexing
with uplink data from the UE.

Type I CSI feedback is supported for CSI Reporting on PUSCH. Type I
wideband and sub-band CSI is supported for CSI Reporting on the PUSCH.
Type II CSI is supported for CSI Reporting on the PUSCH.

For Type I, Type II and Enhanced Type II CSI feedback on PUSCH, a CSI
report comprises of two parts. Part 1 has a fixed payload size and is
used to identify the number of information bits in Part 2. Part 1 shall
be transmitted in its entirety before Part 2.

\- For Type I CSI feedback, Part 1 contains RI (if reported), CRI (if
reported), CQI for the first codeword (if reported). Part 2 contains PMI
(if reported), LI (if reported) and contains the CQI for the second
codeword (if reported) when RI is larger than 4.

\- For Type II CSI feedback, Part 1 contains RI (if reported), CQI, and
an indication of the number of non-zero wideband amplitude coefficients
per layer for the Type II CSI (see Clause 5.2.2.2.3). The fields of Part
1 -- RI (if reported), CQI, and the indication of the number of non-zero
wideband amplitude coefficients for each layer -- are separately
encoded. Part 2 contains the PMI and LI (if reported) of the Type II
CSI. The elements of $i_{1,4,l}$, $i_{2,1,l}$ (if reported) and
$i_{2,2,l}$ (if reported) are reported in the increasing order of their
indices, $i = 0,1,\ldots,\ 2L - 1$, where the element of the lowest
index is mapped to the most significant bits and the element of the
highest index is mapped to the least significant bits. Part 1 and 2 are
separately encoded.

\- For Enhanced Type II CSI feedback, Part 1 contains RI (if reported),
CQI, and an indication of the overall number of non-zero amplitude
coefficients across layers for the Enhanced Type II CSI (see Clause
5.2.2.2.5). The fields of Part 1 -- RI (if reported), CQI, and the
indication of the overall number of non-zero amplitude coefficients
across layers -- are separately encoded. Part 2 contains the PMI of the
Enhanced Type II CSI. Part 1 and 2 are separately encoded.

A Type II CSI report that is carried on the PUSCH shall be computed
independently from any Type II CSI report that is carried on the PUCCH
formats 3 or 4 (see Clause 5.2.4 and 5.2.2).

When the higher layer parameter *reportQuantity* is configured with one
of the values \'cri-RSRP\', \'ssb-Index-RSRP\', \'cri-SINR\' or
\'ssb-Index-SINR\', the CSI feedback consists of a single part.

For both Type I and Type II reports configured for PUCCH but transmitted
on PUSCH, the determination of the payload for CSI part 1 and CSI part 2
follows that of PUCCH as described in Clause 5.2.4.

When CSI reporting on PUSCH comprises two parts, the UE may omit a
portion of the Part 2 CSI. Omission of Part 2 CSI is according to the
priority order shown in Table 5.2.3-1, where is the number of CSI
reports configured to be carried on the PUSCH. Priority 0 is the highest
priority and priority is the lowest priority and the CSI report *n*
corresponds to the CSI report with the *n*th smallest
Pri~i,CSI~(*y,k,c,s*) value among the CSI reports as defined in Clause
5.2.5. The subbands for a given CSI report *n* indicated by the higher
layer parameter *csi-ReportingBand* are numbered continuously in
increasing order with the lowest subband of *csi-ReportingBand* as
subband 0. When omitting Part 2 CSI information for a particular
priority level, the UE shall omit all of the information at that
priority level.

\- For Enhanced Type II reports, for a given CSI report $n$, each
reported element of indices $i_{2,4,l}$ $i_{2,5,l}\ $and $i_{1,7,l}$,
indexed by $l,i$ and $f$, is associated with a priority value
$\text{Pri}\left( l,i,f \right) = 2 \cdot L \cdot \upsilon \cdot \pi\left( f \right) + \upsilon \cdot i + l$,
with
$\pi(f) = min(2 \cdot n_{3,l}^{\left( f \right)},2 \cdot \left( N_{3} - n_{3,l}^{(f)} \right) - 1)$
with $l = 1,2,\ldots,\upsilon$, $i = 0,1,\ldots,2L - 1$, and
$f = 0,1,\ldots,M_{\upsilon} - 1$, and where $n_{3,l}^{(f)}$ is defined
in Clause 5.2.2.2.5. The element with the highest priority has the
lowest associated value $\text{Pri}\left( l,i,f \right)$. Omission of
Part 2 CSI is according to the priority order shown in Table 5.2.3-1,
where

\- Group 0 includes indices $i_{1,1}$ (if reported), $i_{1,2}$ (if
reported) and $i_{1,8,l}$ ($l = 1,\ldots,\upsilon$).

\- Group 1 includes indices $i_{1,5}$ (if reported), $i_{1,6,l}$ (if
reported), the
$\upsilon 2LM_{\upsilon} - \left\lfloor K^{\text{NZ}}/2 \right\rfloor$
highest priority elements of $i_{1,7,l}$, $i_{2,3,l}$, the
$\max\left( 0,\left\lceil \frac{K^{\text{NZ}}}{2} \right\rceil - \upsilon \right)$
highest priority elements of $i_{2,4,l}$ and the
$\max\left( 0,\left\lceil \frac{K^{\text{NZ}}}{2} \right\rceil - \upsilon \right)$
highest priority elements of $i_{2,5,l}$ ($l = 1,\ldots,\upsilon$).

\- Group 2 includes the $\left\lfloor K^{\text{NZ}}/2 \right\rfloor$
lowest priority elements of $i_{1,7,l}$, the
$\min\left( K^{\text{NZ}} - \nu,\left\lfloor \frac{K^{\text{NZ}}}{2} \right\rfloor \right)$
lowest priority elements of $i_{2,4,l}$ and the
$\min\left( K^{\text{NZ}} - \nu,\left\lfloor \frac{K^{\text{NZ}}}{2} \right\rfloor \right)$
lowest priority elements of $i_{2,5,l}$ ($l = 1,\ldots,\upsilon$).

When part 2 CSI is transmitted on PUSCH with no transport block, lower

where $O_{\text{CSI-2}}$, $L_{\text{CSI-2}}$,

38.212\] before HARQ-ACK puncturing part 2 CSI if any, is below a
threshold code rate lower than one, where

\- is the CSI offset value from Table 9.3-2 of \[6, TS 38.213\]

\- *R* is signaled code rate in DCI

If the UE is in an active semi-persistent CSI reporting configuration on
PUSCH, the CSI reporting is deactivated when either the downlink BWP or
the uplink BWP is changed. Another activation command is required to
enable the semi-persistent CSI reporting.

### 5.2.4 CSI reporting using PUCCH

A UE is semi-statically configured by higher layers to perform periodic
CSI Reporting on the PUCCH. A UE can be configured by higher layers for
multiple periodic CSI Reports corresponding to multiple higher layer
configured CSI Reporting Settings, where the associated CSI Resource
Settings are higher layer configured. Periodic CSI reporting on PUCCH
formats 2, 3, 4 supports Type I CSI with wideband granularity.

A UE shall perform semi-persistent CSI reporting on the PUCCH applied
starting from the first slot that is after slot
$n + {3N}_{\text{slot}}^{subframe,µ}$ when the UE would transmit a PUCCH
with HARQ-ACK information in slot *n* corresponding to the PDSCH
carrying the activation command described in clause 6.1.3.16 of \[10, TS
38.321\] where *μ* is the SCS configuration for the PUCCH. The
activation command will contain one or more Reporting Settings where the
associated CSI Resource Settings are configured. Semi-persistent CSI
reporting on the PUCCH supports Type I CSI. Semi-persistent CSI
reporting on the PUCCH format 2 supports Type I CSI with wideband
frequency granularity. Semi-persistent CSI reporting on PUCCH formats 3
or 4 supports Type I CSI with wideband and sub-band frequency
granularities and Type II CSI Part 1.

When the PUCCH carry Type I CSI with wideband frequency granularity, the
CSI payload carried by the PUCCH format 2 and PUCCH formats 3, or 4 are
identical and the same irrespective of RI (if reported), CRI (if
reported). For type I CSI sub-band reporting on PUCCH formats 3, or 4,
the payload is split into two parts. The first part contains RI (if
reported), CRI (if reported), CQI for the first codeword. The second
part contains PMI and contains the CQI for the second codeword when RI
\> 4.

A semi-persistent report carried on the PUCCH formats 3 or 4 supports
Type II CSI feedback, but only Part 1 of Type II CSI feedback (See
Clause 5.2.2 and 5.2.3). Supporting Type II CSI reporting on the PUCCH
formats 3 or 4 is a UE capability *type2-SP-CSI-Feedback-LongPUCCH*. A
Type II CSI report (Part 1 only) carried on PUCCH formats 3 or 4 shall
be calculated independently of any Type II CSI reports carried on the
PUSCH (see Clause 5.2.3).

When the UE is configured with CSI Reporting on PUCCH formats 2, 3 or 4,
each PUCCH resource is configured for each candidate UL BWP.

If the UE is in an active semi-persistent CSI reporting configuration on
PUCCH and has not received a deactivation command, the CSI reporting
takes place when the BWP in which the reporting is configured to take
place is the active BWP, otherwise the CSI reporting is suspended.

A UE is not expected to report CSI with a total number of UCI bits and
CRC bits larger than 115 bits when configured with PUCCH format 4. For
CSI reports transmitted on a PUCCH, if all CSI reports consist of one
part, the UE may omit a portion of CSI reports. Omission of CSI is
according to the priority order determined from the
Pri~i,CSI~(*y,k,c,s*) value as defined in Clause 5.2.5. CSI report is
omitted beginning with the lowest priority level until the CSI report
code rate is less or equal to the one configured by the higher layer
parameter *maxCodeRate*.

If any of the CSI reports consist of two parts, the UE may omit a
portion of Part 2 CSI. Omission of Part 2 CSI is according to the
priority order shown in Table 5.2.3-1. Part 2 CSI is omitted beginning
with the lowest priority level until the Part 2 CSI code rate is less or
equal to the one configured by higher layer parameter *maxCodeRate*.

### 5.2.5 Priority rules for CSI reports

For two overlapping PUSCHs, the priority rules in this clause are
applied for physical channels with same priority index according to
clause 9 in \[6, TS 38.213\].

CSI reports are associated with a priority value
$\text{Pri}_{\text{iCSI}}\left( y,k,c,s \right) = 2 \bullet N_{\text{cells}} \bullet M_{s} \bullet y + N_{\text{cells}} \bullet M_{s} \bullet k + M_{s} \bullet c + s$
where

\- for aperiodic CSI reports to be carried on PUSCH for semi-persistent
CSI reports to be carried on PUSCH, for semi-persistent CSI reports to
be carried on PUCCH and for periodic CSI reports to be carried on PUCCH;

\- for CSI reports carrying L1-RSRP or L1-SINR and for CSI reports not
carrying L1-RSRP or L1-SINR;

\- *c* is the serving cell index and $N_{\text{cells}}$ is the value of
the higher layer parameter *maxNrofServingCells*;

> \- *s* is the *reportConfigID* and is the value of the higher layer
> parameter *maxNrofCSI-ReportConfigurations.*

A first CSI report is said to have priority over second CSI report if
the associated value is lower for the first report than for the second
report.

Two CSI reports are said to collide if the time occupancy of the
physical channels scheduled to carry the CSI reports overlap in at least
one OFDM symbol and are transmitted on the same carrier. When a UE is
configured to transmit two colliding CSI reports,

\- if *y* values are different between the two CSI reports, the
following rules apply except for the case when one of the *y* value is 2
and the other *y* value is 3 (for CSI reports transmitted on PUSCH, as
described in Clause 5.2.3; for CSI reports transmitted on PUCCH, as
described in Clause 5.2.4):

\- The CSI report with higher value shall not be sent by the UE.

\- otherwise, the two CSI reports are multiplexed or either is dropped
based on the priority values, as described in Clause 9.2.5.2 in \[6, TS
38.213\].

If a semi-persistent CSI report to be carried on PUSCH overlaps in time
with PUSCH data transmission in one or more symbols on the same carrier,
and if the earliest symbol of these PUSCH channels starts no earlier
than N~2~+d~2,1~ symbols after the last symbol of the DCI scheduling the
PUSCH where d~2,1~ is the maximum of the d~2,1~ associated with the
PUSCH carrying semi-persistent CSI report and the PUSCH with data
transmission, the CSI report shall not be transmitted by the UE.
Otherwise, if the timeline requirement is not satisfied this is an error
case.

If a UE would transmit a first PUSCH that includes semi-persistent CSI
reports and a second PUSCH that includes an UL-SCH on the same carrier,
and the first PUSCH transmission would overlap in time with the second
PUSCH transmission, the UE does not transmit the first PUSCH and
transmits the second PUSCH. The UE expects that the first and second
PUSCH transmissions satisfy the above timing conditions for PUSCH
transmissions that overlap in time when at least one of the first or
second PUSCH transmissions is in response to a DCI format detection by
the UE.

5.3 UE PDSCH processing procedure time
--------------------------------------

If the first uplink symbol of the PUCCH which carries the HARQ-ACK
information, as defined by the assigned HARQ-ACK timing *K~1\ ~*and the
PUCCH resource to be used and including the effect of the timing
advance, starts no earlier than at symbol *L~1~*, where *L~1~* is
defined as the next uplink symbol with its CP starting after after the
end of the last symbol of the PDSCH carrying the TB being acknowledged,
then the UE shall provide a valid HARQ-ACK message.

*- N~1~* is based on *µ* of table 5.3-1 and table 5.3-2 for UE
processing capability 1 and 2 respectively, where *µ* corresponds to the
one of (*µ~PDCCH~*, *µ~PDSCH~*, *µ~UL~*) resulting with the largest
*T~proc,1~*, where the *µ~PDCCH~* corresponds to the subcarrier spacing
of the PDCCH scheduling the PDSCH, the *µ~PDSCH~* corresponds to the
subcarrier spacing of the scheduled PDSCH, and *µ~UL~* corresponds to
the subcarrier spacing of the uplink channel with which the HARQ-ACK is
to be transmitted, and κ is defined in clause 4.1 of \[4, TS 38.211\].

*-* For operation with shared spectrum channel access, is calculated
according to \[4, TS 38.211\], otherwise =0.

*-* If the PDSCH DM-RS position $l_{1}$ for the additional DM-RS in
Table 7.4.1.1.2-3 in clause 7.4.1.1.2 of \[4, TS 38.211\] is
$l_{1} = 12$ then *N~1,0~=14* in Table 5.3-1*,* otherwise *N~1,0~=13.*

\- If the UE is configured with multiple active component carriers, the
first uplink symbol which carries the HARQ-ACK information further
includes the effect of timing difference between the component carriers
as given in \[11, TS 38.133\].

\- For the PDSCH mapping type A as given in clause 7.4.1.1 of \[4, TS
38.211\]: if the last symbol of PDSCH is on the *i-*th symbol of the
slot where *i* \< 7, then *d~1,1~ = 7 - i*, otherwise *d~1,1~ = 0*

\- If a PUCCH of a larger priority index would overlap with PUCCH/PUSCH
of a smaller priority index, *d~2~* for the PUCCH of a larger priority
is set as reported by the UE; otherwise *d~2~ = 0.*

\- For UE processing capability 1: If the PDSCH is mapping type B as
given in clause 7.4.1.1 of \[4, TS 38.211\], and

\- if the number of PDSCH symbols allocated is *L* ≥ 7, then *d~1,1~* =
0,

\- if the number of PDSCH symbols allocated is *L* ≥ 4 and *L* ≤ 6, then
*d~1,1~* = 7- *L.*

\- if the number of PDSCH symbols allocated is *L* = *3* then *d~1,1~ =
3 +* min *(d,1)*, where *d* is the number of overlapping symbols of the
scheduling PDCCH and the scheduled PDSCH.

\- if the number of PDSCH symbols allocated is 2, then *d~1,1~* = 3*+d*,
where *d* is the number of overlapping symbols of the scheduling PDCCH
and the scheduled PDSCH.

\- For UE processing capability 2: If the PDSCH is mapping type B as
given in clause 7.4.1.1 of \[4, TS 38.211\],

\- if the number of PDSCH symbols allocated is *L* ≥ 7, then *d~1,1~* =
0,

\- if the number of PDSCH symbols allocated is *L* ≥ 3 and *L* ≤ 6, then
*d~1,1~* is the number of overlapping symbols of the scheduling PDCCH
and the scheduled PDSCH,

\- if the number of PDSCH symbols allocated is 2,

\- if the scheduling PDCCH was in a 3-symbol CORESET and the CORESET and
the PDSCH had the same starting symbol, then *d~1,1~* = 3,

\- otherwise *d~1,1~* is the number of overlapping symbols of the
scheduling PDCCH and the scheduled PDSCH.

\- For UE processing capability 2 with scheduling limitation when
*µ~PDSCH~* = 1, if the scheduled RB allocation exceeds 136 RBs, the UE
defaults to capability 1 processing time. The UE may skip decoding a
number of PDSCHs with last symbol within 10 symbols before the start of
a PDSCH that is scheduled to follow Capability 2, if any of those PDSCHs
are scheduled with more than 136 RBs with 30kHz SCS and following
Capability 1 processing time.

\- For a UE that supports capability 2 on a given cell, the processing
time according to UE processing capability 2 is applied if the high
layer parameter *processingType2Enabled* in *PDSCH-ServingCellConfig* is
configured for the cell and set to \'*enable\'*.

\- If this PUCCH resource is overlapping with another PUCCH or PUSCH
resource, then HARQ-ACK is multiplexed following the procedure in clause
9.2.5 of \[6, TS 38.213\], otherwise the HARQ-ACK message is transmitted
on PUCCH.

Otherwise the UE may not provide a valid HARQ-ACK corresponding to the
scheduled PDSCH. The value of *T~proc,1~* is used both in the case of
normal and extended cyclic prefix.

For a PDSCH that consists of two PDSCH transmission occasions in time
domain in one slot, *d~1,1~* is calculated based on the first PDSCH
transmission occasion in the slot, and as described above.

### 5.3.1 Application delay of the minimum scheduling offset restriction

When the UE is scheduled with DCI format 0\_1 or 1\_1 with a \'*Minimum
applicable scheduling offset indicator*\' field in slot *n*, it shall
determine the *K*~0min~ and *K*~2min~ values, if configured
respectively, to be applied, while the previously applied *K*~0min~
and/or *K*~2min~ values are applied until the new values take effect. If
the DCI in slot *n* also indicates an active DL (UL) BWP change for a
serving cell, the indicated *K*~0min~ (*K*~2min~) value in the new
active DL (UL) BWP, if configured, is applied from the slot indicated by
the slot offset value of the time domain resource assignment field in
the DCI. Otherwise, change of applied minimum scheduling offset
restriction indication carried by DCI in slot *n*, shall be applied in
slot *n*+*X* of the scheduling cell. The UE does not expect to be
scheduled with DCI format 0\_1 or 1\_1 with \'*Minimum applicable
scheduling offset indicator*\' field indicating another change to
*K*~0min~ or *K*~2min~ for the same active BWP of the scheduled cell
before slot *n+X* of the scheduling cell.

When the DCI format 0\_1 or 1\_1 with \'*Minimum applicable scheduling
offset indicator*\' field indicating a change to the applied *K*~0min~
or *K*~2min~ is contained within the first three symbols of slot *n*,
the value of application delay *X* is determined by,
$X = \max\left( \left\lceil K_{0minOld} \bullet \frac{2^{\mu_{\text{PDCCH}}}}{2^{\mu_{\text{PDSCH}}}} \right\rceil,Z_{\mu} \right)\ $where
*K*~0minOld~ is the currently applied *K*~0min~ value of the active DL
BWP in the scheduled cell and is zero, if *minimumSchedulingOffsetK0* is
not configured for the active DL BWP in the scheduled cell, *Z~µ~* is
determined by the subcarrier spacing of the active DL BWP in the
scheduling cell in slot *n*, and given in Table 5.3.1-1, and *µ*~PDCCH~
and *µ*~PDSCH~ are the sub-carrier spacing configurations for PDCCH of
the active DL BWP in the scheduling cell and PDSCH of the active DL BWP
in the scheduled cell, respectively, in slot *n*. After indication of a
change to the applied *K*~0min~ or *K*~2min~ of the scheduled cell in
slot *n* of the scheduling cell, if there is an active DL BWP change in
the scheduling cell before slot *n+X*, the new *K*~0min~ and/or
*K*~2min~ values are applied from the first slot no earlier than the
start of slot *n+X* based on the sub-carrier spacing configuration of
the active DL BWP in the scheduling cell in slot *n*.

When the DCI format 0\_1 or 1\_1 with \'*Minimum applicable scheduling
offset indicator*\' field is received outside the first three symbols of
the slot, value of *Z~µ~* from Table 5.3.1-1 is incremented by one
before determining the application delay *X*.

5.4 UE CSI computation time
---------------------------

When the *CSI request* field on a DCI triggers a CSI report(s) on PUSCH,
the UE shall provide a valid CSI report for the *n*-th triggered report,

\- if the first uplink symbol to carry the corresponding CSI report(s)
including the effect of the timing advance, starts no earlier than at
symbol *Z~ref~*, and

\- if the first uplink symbol to carry the *n*-th CSI report including
the effect of the timing advance, starts no earlier than at symbol
*Z\'~ref~(n),*

where *Z~ref~* is defined as the next uplink symbol with its CP starting
after the end of the last symbol of the PDCCH triggering the CSI
report(s), and where *Z\'~ref~(n),* is defined as the next uplink symbol
with its CP starting after the end of the last symbol in time of the
latest of: aperiodic CSI-RS resource for channel measurements, aperiodic
CSI-IM used for interference measurements, and aperiodic NZP CSI-RS for
interference measurement, when aperiodic CSI-RS is used for channel
measurement for the *n*-th triggered CSI report, and where *T~switch~*
is defined in clause 6.4 and is applied only if $Z_{1}$ of table 5.4-1
is applied.

If the PUSCH indicated by the DCI is overlapping with another PUCCH or
PUSCH, then the CSI report(s) are multiplexed following the procedure in
clause 9.2.5 of \[6, TS 38.213\] and clause 5.2.5 when applicable,
otherwise the CSI report(s) are transmitted on the PUSCH indicated by
the DCI.

When the *CSI request* field on a DCI triggers a CSI report(s) on PUSCH,
if the first uplink symbol to carry the corresponding CSI report(s)
including the effect of the timing advance, starts earlier than at
symbol *Z~ref~*,

\- the UE may ignore the scheduling DCI if no HARQ-ACK or transport
block is multiplexed on the PUSCH.

When the *CSI request* field on a DCI triggers a CSI report(s) on PUSCH,
if the first uplink symbol to carry the *n*-th CSI report including the
effect of the timing advance, starts earlier than at symbol
*Z\'~ref~(n),*

\- the UE may ignore the scheduling DCI if the number of triggered
reports is one and no HARQ-ACK or transport block is multiplexed on the
PUSCH

\- Otherwise, the UE is not required to update the CSI for the *n*-th
triggered CSI report.

*Z,* *Z\'* and *µ* are defined as:

$Z = \max_{m = 0,\ldots,M - 1}{(Z(m))}$ and
$Z' = \max_{m = 0,\ldots,M - 1}{(Z'(m))}$, where *M* is the number of
updated CSI report(s) according to Clause 5.2.1.6, $(Z(m),Z'(m))$
corresponds to the *m*-th updated CSI report and is defined as

\- $(Z_{1},Z_{1}^{'})$ of the table 5.4-1 if the CSI is triggered
without a PUSCH with either transport block or HARQ-ACK or both when *L*
= 0 CPUs are occupied (according to Clause 5.2.1.6) and the CSI to be
transmitted is a single CSI and corresponds to wideband
frequency-granularity where the CSI corresponds to at most 4 CSI-RS
ports in a single resource without CRI report and where *CodebookType*
is set to \'typeI-SinglePanel\' or where *reportQuantity* is set to
\'cri-RI-CQI\', or

\- $(Z_{1},Z_{1}^{'})$ of the table 5.4-2 if the CSI to be transmitted
corresponds to wideband frequency-granularity where the CSI corresponds
to at most 4 CSI-RS ports in a single resource without CRI report and
where *CodebookType* is set to \'typeI-SinglePanel\' or where
*reportQuantity* is set to \'cri-RI-CQI\', or

\- $(Z_{1},Z_{1}^{'})$ of the table 5.4-2 if the CSI to be transmitted
corresponds to wideband frequency-granularity where the *reportQuantity*
is set to \'*ssb-Index-SINR\'*, or *reportQuantity* is set to
\'*cri-SINR\',* or

\- $(Z_{3},Z_{3}^{'})$ of the table 5.4-2 if *reportQuantity* is set to
\'cri-RSRP\' or \'ssb-Index-RSRP\', $\text{\ where\ }\text{Xµ}\ $is
according to UE reported capability *beamReportTiming* and *KB~l~* is
according to UE reported capability *beamSwitchTiming* as defined in
\[13, TS 38.306\], or

\- $(Z_{2},Z_{2}^{'})$ of table 5.4-2 otherwise.

*- µ* of table 5.4-1 and table 5.4-2 corresponds to the min (*µ~PDCCH~*,
*µ~CSI-RS~, µ~UL~*) where the *µ~PDCCH~* corresponds to the subcarrier
spacing of the PDCCH with which the DCI was transmitted and *µ~UL~*
corresponds to the subcarrier spacing of the PUSCH with which the CSI
report is to be transmitted and *µ~CSI-RS~* corresponds to the minimum
subcarrier spacing of the aperiodic CSI-RS triggered by the DCI

5.5 UE PDSCH reception preparation time with cross carrier scheduling with different subcarrier spacings for PDCCH and PDSCH
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This clause applies only if the PDCCH carrying the scheduling DCI is
received on one carrier with one OFDM subcarrier spacing (µ~PDCCH~), and
the PDSCH scheduled to be received by the DCI is on another carrier with
another OFDM subcarrier spacing (µ~PDSCH~).

If the µ~PDCCH~ \< µ~PDSCH~, the UE is expected to receive the scheduled
PDSCH, if the first symbol in the PDSCH allocation, including the DM-RS,
as defined by the slot offset *K~0~* and the start and length indicator
*SLIV* of the scheduling DCI starts no earlier than the first symbol of
the slot of the PDSCH reception starting at least *N~pdsch~* PDCCH
symbols after the end of the PDCCH scheduling the PDSCH, not taking into
account the effect of receive timing difference between the scheduling
cell and the scheduled cell.

If the µ~PDCCH~ \> µ~PDSCH~, the UE is expected to receive the scheduled
PDSCH, if the first symbol in the PDSCH allocation, including the DM-RS,
as defined by the slot offset *K~0~* and the start and length indicator
*SLIV* of the scheduling DCI starts no earlier than *N~pdsch~* PDCCH
symbols after the end of the PDCCH scheduling the PDSCH, not taking into
account the effect of receive timing difference between the scheduling
cell and the scheduled cell.

6 Physical uplink shared channel related procedure
==================================================

6.1 UE procedure for transmitting the physical uplink shared channel
--------------------------------------------------------------------

PUSCH transmission(s) can be dynamically scheduled by an UL grant in a
DCI, or the transmission can correspond to a configured grant Type 1 or
Type 2. The configured grant Type 1 PUSCH transmission is
semi-statically configured to operate upon the reception of higher layer
parameter of *configuredGrantConfig including rrc-ConfiguredUplinkGrant*
without the detection of an UL grant in a DCI. The configured grant Type
2 PUSCH transmission is semi-persistently scheduled by an UL grant in a
valid activation DCI according to Clause 10.2 of \[6, TS 38.213\] after
the reception of higher layer parameter *configuredGrantConfig* not
including *rrc-ConfiguredUplinkGrant*. If
*configuredGrantConfigToAddModList* is configured, more than one
configured grant configuration of configured grant Type 1 and/or
configured grant Type 2 may be active at the same time on an active BWP
of a serving cell.

For the PUSCH transmission corresponding to a Type 1 configured grant or
a Type 2 configured grant activated by DCI format 0\_0 or 0\_1, the
parameters applied for the transmission are provided by
*configuredGrantConfig* except for *dataScramblingIdentityPUSCH*,
*txConfig*, *codebookSubset*, *maxRank*, *scaling* of *UCI-OnPUSCH,*
which are provided by *pusch-Config*. For the PUSCH transmission
corresponding to a Type 2 configured grant activated by DCI format 0\_2,
the parameters applied for the transmission are provided by
*configuredGrantConfig* except for *dataScramblingIdentityPUSCH*,
*txConfig*, *codebookSubsetDCI-0-2*, *maxRankDCI-0-2*, *scaling* of
*UCI-OnPUSCH, resourceAllocationType1GranularityDCI-0-2* provided by
*pusch-Config*. If the UE is provided with *transformPrecoder in
configuredGrantConfig, the UE applies the higher layer parameter
tp-pi2BPSK*, if provided in *pusch-Config*, according to the procedure
described in Clause 6.1.4 for the PUSCH transmission corresponding to a
configured grant.

For the PUSCH retransmission scheduled by a PDCCH with CRC scrambled by
CS-RNTI with NDI=1, the parameters in *pusch-Config* are applied for the
PUSCH transmission except for *p0-NominalWithoutGrant, p0-PUSCH-Alpha,
powerControlLoopToUse,* *pathlossReferenceIndex* described in Clause 7.1
of \[6, TS 38.213\], *mcs-Table, mcs-TableTransformPrecoder* described
in Clause 6.1.4.1 and *transformPrecoder* described in Clause 6.1.3.

For a UE configured with two uplinks in a serving cell, PUSCH
retransmission for a TB on the serving cell is not expected to be on a
different uplink than the uplink used for the PUSCH initial transmission
of that TB.

A UE shall upon detection of a PDCCH with a configured DCI format 0\_0,
0\_1 or 0\_2 transmit the corresponding PUSCH as indicated by that DCI
unless the UE does not generate a transport block as described in \[10,
TS38.321\]. Upon detection of a DCI format 0\_1 or 0\_2 with \'*UL-SCH
indicator*\' set to \'0\' and with a non-zero \'*CSI request*\' where
the associated *reportQuantity* in *CSI-ReportConfig* set to \'*none*\'
for all CSI report(s) triggered by \'*CSI request*\' in this DCI format
0\_1 or 0\_2, the UE ignores all fields in this DCI except the \'*CSI
request*\' and the UE shall not transmit the corresponding PUSCH as
indicated by this DCI format 0\_1 or 0\_2. When the UE is scheduled with
multiple PUSCHs by a DCI, HARQ process ID indicated by this DCI applies
to the first PUSCH, as described in clause 6.1.2.1, HARQ process ID is
then incremented by 1 for each subsequent PUSCH(s) in the scheduled
order, with modulo 16 operation applied. For any HARQ process ID(s) in a
given scheduled cell, the UE is not expected to transmit a PUSCH that
overlaps in time with another PUSCH. Except for the case when a UE is
configured by higher layer parameter *PDCCH-Config* that contains two
different values of *coresetPoolIndex* in *ControlResourceSet* for the
active BWP of a serving cell and PDCCHs that schedule two
non-overlapping in time domain PUSCHs are associated to different
*ControlResourceSets* having different values of *coresetPoolIndex,* for
any two HARQ process IDs in a given scheduled cell, if the UE is
scheduled to start a first PUSCH transmission starting in symbol *j* by
a PDCCH ending in symbol *i*, the UE is not expected to be scheduled to
transmit a PUSCH starting earlier than the end of the first PUSCH by a
PDCCH that ends later than symbol *i*. The UE is not expected to be
scheduled to transmit another PUSCH by a DCI format 0\_0 with CRC
scrambled by TC-RNTI, for a given HARQ process with the DCI received
before the end of the expected transmission of the last PUSCH for that
HARQ process if the latter is scheduled by a DCI format 0\_0 with CRC
scrambled by TC-RNTI or by an UL grant in RA Response. The UE is not
expected to be scheduled to transmit another PUSCH by DCI format 0\_0,
0\_1 or 0\_2 scrambled by C-RNTI, CS-RNTI or MCS-C-RNTI for a given HARQ
process with the DCI received before the end of the expected
transmission of the last PUSCH for that HARQ process if the latter is
scheduled by a DCI with CRC scrambled by C-RNTI, CS-RNTI or MCS-C-RNTI.

If a UE is configured by higher layer parameter *PDCCH-Config* that
contains two different values of *coresetPoolIndex* in
*ControlResourceSet* for the active BWP of a serving cell and PDCCHs
that schedule two non-overlapping in time domain PUSCHs are associated
to different *ControlResourceSets* having different values of
*coresetPoolIndex,* for any two HARQ process IDs in a given scheduled
cell, if the UE is scheduled to start a first PUSCH transmission
starting in symbol *j* by a PDCCH associated with a value of
*coresetPoolIndex* ending in symbol *i*, the UE can be scheduled to
transmit a PUSCH starting earlier than the end of the first PUSCH by a
PDCCH associated with a different value of *coresetPoolIndex* that ends
later than symbol *i*.

A UE is not expected to be scheduled by a PDCCH ending in symbol $i$ to
transmit a PUSCH on a given serving cell overlapping in time with a
transmission occasion, where the UE is allowed to transmit a PUSCH with
configured grant according to \[10, TS38.321\], starting in a symbol $j$
on the same serving cell if the end of symbol $i$ is not at least
$N_{2}$ symbols before the beginning of symbol $j$. The value $N_{2}$ in
symbols is determined according to the UE processing capability defined
in Clause 6.4, and $N_{2}\ $and the symbol duration are based on the
minimum of the subcarrier spacing corresponding to the PUSCH with
configured grant and the subcarrier spacing of the PDCCH scheduling the
PUSCH.

If a UE receives an ACK for a given HARQ process in CG-DFI in a PDCCH
ending in symbol *i* to terminate a transport block repetition in a
PUSCH transmission with a configured grant on a given serving cell with
the same HARQ process after symbol *i*, the UE is expected to terminate
the repetition of the transport block in a PUSCH transmission starting
from a symbol *j* if the gap between the end of PDCCH of symbol *i* and
the start of the PUSCH transmission in symbol *j* is equal to or more
than *N2* symbols. The value *N2* in symbols is determined according to
the UE processing capability defined in Clause 6.4, and *N2* and the
symbol duration are based on the minimum of the subcarrier spacing
corresponding to the PUSCH and the subcarrier spacing of the PDCCH
indicating CG-DFI.

A UE is not expected to be scheduled by a PDCCH ending in symbol $i$ to
transmit a PUSCH on a given serving cell for a given HARQ process, if
there is a transmission occasion where the UE is allowed to transmit a
PUSCH with configured grant according to \[10, TS38.321\] with the same
HARQ process on the same serving cell starting in a symbol $j$ after
symbol $i$, and if the gap between the end of PDCCH and the beginning of
symbol $j$ is less than $N_{2}$ symbols. The value $N_{2}$ in symbols is
determined according to the UE processing capability defined in Clause
6.4, and $N_{2}\ $and the symbol duration are based on the minimum of
the subcarrier spacing corresponding to the PUSCH with configured grant
and the subcarrier spacing of the PDCCH scheduling the PUSCH.

For PUSCH scheduled by DCI format 0\_0 on a cell, the UE shall transmit
PUSCH according to the spatial relation, if applicable, corresponding to
the dedicated PUCCH resource with the lowest ID within the active UL BWP
of the cell, as described in Clause 9.2.1 of \[6, TS 38.213\].

For PUSCH scheduled by DCI format 0\_0 on a cell and if the higher layer
parameter *enableDefaultBeamPL-ForPUSCH0-0* is set \'enabled\', the UE
is not configured with PUCCH resources on the active UL BWP and the UE
is in RRC connected mode, the UE shall transmit PUSCH according to the
spatial relation, if applicable, with a reference to the RS configured
with *qcl-Type* set to \'typeD\' corresponding to the QCL assumption of
the CORESET with the lowest ID on the active DL BWP of the cell.

For PUSCH scheduled by DCI format 0\_0 on a cell and if the higher layer
parameter *enableDefaultBeamPL-ForPUSCH0-0* is set \'enabled\', the UE
is configured with PUCCH resources on the active UL BWP where all the
PUCCH resource(s) are not configured with any spatial relation and the
UE is in RRC connected mode, the UE shall transmit PUSCH according to
the spatial relation, if applicable, with a reference to the RS
configured with *qcl-Type* set to \'typeD\' corresponding to the QCL
assumption of the CORESET with the lowest ID on the active DL BWP of the
cell in case CORESET(s) are configured on the cell.

For uplink, 16 HARQ processes per cell is supported by the UE.

### 6.1.1 Transmission schemes

Two transmission schemes are supported for PUSCH: codebook based
transmission and non-codebook based transmission. The UE is configured
with codebook based transmission when the higher layer parameter
*txConfig* in *pusch-Config* is set to \'codebook\', the UE is
configured non-codebook based transmission when the higher layer
parameter *txConfig* is set to \'nonCodebook\'. If the higher layer
parameter *txConfig* is not configured, the UE is not expected to be
scheduled by DCI format 0\_1 or 0\_2. If PUSCH is scheduled by DCI
format 0\_0, the PUSCH transmission is based on a single antenna port.
Except if the higher layer parameter *enableDefaultBeamPL-ForPUSCH0-0*
is set \'enabled\', the UE shall not expect PUSCH scheduled by DCI
format 0\_0 in a BWP without configured PUCCH resource with
*PUCCH-SpatialRelationInfo* in frequency range 2 in RRC connected mode.

#### 6.1.1.1 Codebook based UL transmission

For codebook based transmission, PUSCH can be scheduled by DCI format
0\_0, DCI format 0\_1, DCI format 0\_2 or semi-statically configured to
operate according to Clause 6.1.2.3. If this PUSCH is scheduled by DCI
format 0\_1, DCI format 0\_2, or semi-statically configured to operate
according to Clause 6.1.2.3, the UE determines its PUSCH transmission
precoder based on SRI, TPMI and the transmission rank, where the SRI,
TPMI and the transmission rank are given by DCI fields of SRS resource
indicator and Precoding information and number of layers in clause
7.3.1.1.2 and 7.3.1.1.3 of \[5, TS 38.212\] for DCI format 0\_1 and 0\_2
or given by *srs-ResourceIndicator* and *precodingAndNumberOfLayers*
according to clause 6.1.2.3. The *SRS-ResourceSet(s)* applicable for
PUSCH scheduled by DCI format 0\_1 and DCI format 0\_2 are defined by
the entries of the higher layer parameter *srs-ResourceSetToAddModList*
and *srs-ResourceSetToAddModListDCI-0-2* in *SRS-config*, respectively.
Only one SRS resource set can be configured in
*srs-ResourceSetToAddModList* with higher layer parameter *usage* in
*SRS-ResourceSet* set to \'codebook\', and only one SRS resource set can
be configured in *srs-ResourceSetToAddModListDCI-0-2* with higher layer
parameter *usage* in *SRS-ResourceSet* set to \'codebook\'. The TPMI is
used to indicate the precoder to be applied over the layers {0...*ν*-1}
and that corresponds to the SRS resource selected by the SRI when
multiple SRS resources are configured, or if a single SRS resource is
configured TPMI is used to indicate the precoder to be applied over the
layers {0...*ν*-1} and that corresponds to the SRS resource. The
transmission precoder is selected from the uplink codebook that has a
number of antenna ports equal to higher layer parameter *nrofSRS-Ports*
in SRS-Config, as defined in Clause 6.3.1.5 of \[4, TS 38.211\]. When
the UE is configured with the higher layer parameter *txConfig* set to
\'codebook\', the UE is configured with at least one SRS resource. The
indicated SRI in slot *n* is associated with the most recent
transmission of SRS resource identified by the SRI, where the SRS
resource is prior to the PDCCH carrying the SRI.

For codebook based transmission, the UE determines its codebook subsets
based on TPMI and upon the reception of higher layer parameter
*codebookSubset* in *pusch-Config* for PUSCH associated with DCI format
0\_1 and *codebookSubsetDCI-0-2* in *pusch-Config* for PUSCH associated
with DCI format 0\_2 which may be configured with
*\'*fullyAndPartialAndNonCoherent*\'*, or *\'*partialAndNonCoherent*\'*,
or \'nonCoherent\' depending on the UE capability. When higher layer
parameter *ul-FullPowerTransmission* is set to \'*fullpowerMode2\'* and
the higher layer parameter *codebookSubset* or the higher layer
parameter *codebookSubsetDCI-0-2* is set to *\'*partialAndNonCoherent\',
and when the SRS-resourceSet with usage set to \"codebook\" includes at
least one SRS resource with 4 ports and one SRS resource with 2 ports,
the codebookSubset associated with the 2-port SRS resource is
\'nonCoherent\'. The maximum transmission rank may be configured by the
higher layer parameter *maxRank* in *pusch-Config* for PUSCH scheduled
with DCI format 0\_1 and *maxRankDCI-0-2* for PUSCH scheduled with DCI
format 0\_2*.*

A UE reporting its UE capability of \'partialAndNonCoherent\'
transmission shall not expect to be configured by either
*codebookSubset* or *codebookSubsetDCI-0-2* with
\'fullyAndPartialAndNonCoherent*\'*.

A UE reporting its UE capability of \'nonCoherent\' transmission shall
not expect to be configured by either *codebookSubset* or
*codebookSubsetDCI-0-2* with *\'*fullyAndPartialAndNonCoherent*\'* or
with *\'*partialAndNonCoherent\'.

A UE shall not expect to be configured with the higher layer parameter
*codebookSubset* or the higher layer parameter *codebookSubsetDCI-0-2*
set to *\'*partialAndNonCoherent\' when higher layer parameter
*nrofSRS-Ports* in an *SRS-ResourceSet* with *usage* set to \'codebook\'
indicates that the maximum number of the configured SRS antenna ports in
the *SRS-ResourceSet* is two.

For codebook based transmission, only one SRS resource can be indicated
based on the SRI from within the SRS resource set. Except when higher
layer parameter *ul-FullPowerTransmission* is set to
\'*fullpowerMode2*\', the maximum number of configured SRS resources for
codebook based transmission is 2. If aperiodic SRS is configured for a
UE, the SRS request field in DCI triggers the transmission of aperiodic
SRS resources.

A UE shall not expect to be configured with higher layer parameter
*ul-FullPowerTransmission* set to \'fullpowerMode1*\'* and
*codebookSubset* or *codebookSubsetDCI-0-2* set to
*\'*fullAndPartialAndNonCoherent*\'* simultaneously.

The UE shall transmit PUSCH using the same antenna port(s) as the SRS
port(s) in the SRS resource indicated by the DCI format 0\_1 or 0\_2 or
by *configuredGrantConfig* according to clause 6.1.2.3.

The DM-RS antenna ports
![](media/image709.wmf){width="0.6479166666666667in"
height="0.21736111111111112in"} in Clause 6.4.1.1.3 of \[4, TS38.211\]
are determined according to the ordering of DM-RS port(s) given by
Tables 7.3.1.1.2-6 to 7.3.1.1.2-23 in Clause 7.3.1.1.2 of \[5, TS
38.212\].

Except when higher layer parameter *ul-FullPowerTransmission* is set to
\'*fullpowerMode2*\', when multiple SRS resources are configured by
*SRS-ResourceSet* with *usage* set to \'codebook\', the UE shall expect
that higher layer parameters *nrofSRS-Ports* in *SRS-Resource* in
*SRS-ResourceSet* shall be configured with the same value for all these
SRS resources.

When higher layer parameter *ul-FullPowerTransmission* is set to
\'*fullpowerMode2*\',

\- the UE can be configured with one SRS resource or multiple SRS
resources with same or different number of SRS ports within an SRS
resource set with *usage* set to \'codebook\'.

**- up to 2 different spatial relations can be configured for all SRS
resources in the SRS resource set with *usage* set to \'codebook\'
when** multiple SRS resources are configured in the SRS resource
set**.**

**-** subject to UE capability, **a maximum of 2 or 4 SRS resources are
supported in an SRS resource set with *usage* set to \'codebook\'.**

#### 6.1.1.2 Non-Codebook based UL transmission

For non-codebook based transmission, PUSCH can be scheduled by DCI
format 0\_0, DCI format 0\_1, DCI format 0\_2 or semi-statically
configured to operate according to Clause 6.1.2.3. If this PUSCH is
scheduled by DCI format 0\_1, DCI format 0\_2, or semi-statically
configured to operate according to Clause 6.1.2.3, the UE can determine
its PUSCH precoder and transmission rank based on the SRI when multiple
SRS resources are configured, where the SRI is given by the SRS resource
indicator in DCI according to clause 7.3.1.1.2 and 7.3.1.1.3 of \[5,
38.212\] for DCI format 0\_1 and DCI format 0\_2, or the SRI is given by
*srs-ResourceIndicator* according to clause 6.1.2.3. The
*SRS-ResourceSet(s)* applicable for PUSCH scheduled by DCI format 0\_1
and DCI format 0\_2 are defined by the entries of the higher layer
parameter *srs-ResourceSetToAddModList* and
*srs-ResourceSetToAddModListDCI-0-2* in *SRS-config*, respectively. The
UE shall use one or multiple SRS resources for SRS transmission, where,
in a SRS resource set, the maximum number of SRS resources which can be
configured to the UE for simultaneous transmission in the same symbol
and the maximum number of SRS resources are UE capabilities. The SRS
resources transmitted simultaneously occupy the same RBs. Only one SRS
port for each SRS resource is configured. Only one SRS resource set can
be configured in *srs-ResourceSetToAddModList* with higher layer
parameter *usage* in *SRS-ResourceSet* set to \'nonCodebook\', and only
one SRS resource set can be configured in
*srs-ResourceSetToAddModListDCI-0-2* with higher layer parameter *usage*
in *SRS-ResourceSet* set to \'nonCodebook\'. The maximum number of SRS
resources that can be configured for non-codebook based uplink
transmission is 4. The indicated SRI in slot *n* is associated with the
most recent transmission of SRS resource(s) identified by the SRI, where
the SRS transmission is prior to the PDCCH carrying the SRI.

For non-codebook based transmission, the UE can calculate the precoder
used for the transmission of SRS based on measurement of an associated
NZP CSI-RS resource. A UE can be configured with only one NZP CSI-RS
resource for the SRS resource set with higher layer parameter usage in
*SRS-ResourceSet* set to \'nonCodebook\' if configured.

\- If aperiodic SRS resource set is configured, the associated
NZP-CSI-RS is indicated via SRS request field in DCI format 0\_1 and
1\_1, as well as DCI format 0\_2 (if SRS request field is present) and
DCI format 1\_2 (if SRS request field is present), where
*AperiodicSRS-ResourceTrigger* and *AperiodicSRS-ResourceTriggerList*
(indicating the association between aperiodic SRS triggering state(s)
and SRS resource sets), triggered SRS resource(s) *srs-ResourceSetId*,
*csi-RS (indicating the associated NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceId)* are higher
layer configured in *SRS-ResourceSet*. The *SRS-ResourceSet(s)*
associated with the SRS request by DCI format 0\_1 and 1\_1 are defined
by the entries of the higher layer parameter
*srs-ResourceSetToAddModList* and the *SRS-ResourceSet(s)* associated
with the SRS request by DCI format 0\_2 and 1\_2 are defined by the
entries of the higher layer parameter
*srs-ResourceSetToAddModListDCI-0-2*. A UE is not expected to update the
SRS precoding information if the gap from the last symbol of the
reception of the aperiodic NZP-CSI-RS resource and the first symbol of
the aperiodic SRS transmission is less than 42 OFDM symbols.

\- If the UE configured with aperiodic SRS associated with aperiodic NZP
CSI-RS resource, the presence of the associated CSI-RS is indicated by
the SRS request field if the value of the SRS request field is not
\'00\' as in Table 7.3.1.1.2-24 of \[5, TS 38.212\] and if the
scheduling DCI is not used for cross carrier or cross bandwidth part
scheduling. If UE is configured with *minimumSchedulingOffsetK0* in the
active DL BWP and the currently applicable minimum scheduling offset
restriction *K~0,min~* is larger than 0, the UE does not expected to
receive the scheduling DCI with the SRS request field value other than
\'00\'. The CSI-RS is located in the same slot as the SRS request field.
If the UE configured with aperiodic SRS associated with aperiodic NZP
CSI-RS resource, any of the TCI states configured in the scheduled CC
shall not be configured with *qcl-Type* set to \'typeD\'.

\- If periodic or semi-persistent SRS resource set is configured, the
*NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceId* for measurement is indicated via higher layer
parameter *associatedCSI-RS* in *SRS-ResourceSet*.

The UE shall perform one-to-one mapping from the indicated SRI(s) to the
indicated DM-RS ports(s) and their corresponding PUSCH layers {0 ...
ν-1} given by DCI format 0\_1 or 0\_2 or by *configuredGrantConfig*
according to clause 6.1.2.3 in increasing order.

The UE shall transmit PUSCH using the same antenna ports as the SRS
port(s) in the SRS resource(s) indicated by SRI(s) given by DCI format
0\_1 or 0\_2 or by *configuredGrantConfig* according to clause 6.1.2.3,
where the SRS port in (*i*+1)-th SRS resource in the SRS resource set is
indexed as .

The DM-RS antenna ports
![](media/image709.wmf){width="0.6479166666666667in"
height="0.21736111111111112in"} in Clause 6.4.1.1.3 of \[4, TS 38.211\]
are determined according to the ordering of DM-RS port(s) given by
Tables 7.3.1.1.2-6 to 7.3.1.1.2-23 in Clause 7.3.1.1.2 of \[5, TS
38.212\].

For non-codebook based transmission, the UE does not expect to be
configured with both *spatialRelationInfo* for SRS resource and
*associatedCSI-RS* in *SRS-ResourceSet* for SRS resource set.

For non-codebook based transmission, the UE can be scheduled with DCI
format 0\_1 or 0\_2 when at least one SRS resource is configured in
*SRS-ResourceSet* with *usage* set to \'nonCodebook\'.

### 6.1.2 Resource allocation 

#### 6.1.2.1 Resource allocation in time domain

When the UE is scheduled to transmit a transport block and no CSI report
by a DCI or by a RAR UL grant or fallbackRAR UL grant, or the UE is
scheduled to transmit a transport block and a CSI report(s) on PUSCH by
a DCI, the \'*Time domain resource assignment\'* field value *m* of the
DCI or the *PUSCH time resource allocation* field value *m* of the RAR
UL grant or of the fallbackRAR UL grant provides a row index *m* + 1 to
an allocated table. The determination of the used resource allocation
table is defined in Clause 6.1.2.1.1. The indexed row defines the slot
offset *K~2~*, the start and length indicator *SLIV*, or directly the
start symbol *S* and the allocation length *L*, the PUSCH mapping type,
and the number of repetitions (if *numberOfRepetitions* is present in
the resource allocation table) to be applied in the PUSCH transmission.

When the UE is scheduled to transmit a PUSCH with no transport block and
with a CSI report(s) by a \'*CSI request\'* field on a DCI, the \'*Time
domain resource assignment\'* field value *m* of the DCI provides a row
index *m* + 1 to the allocated table as defined in Clause 6.1.2.1.1. The
indexed row defines the start and length indicator SLIV, or directly the
start symbol *S* and the allocation length *L*, and the PUSCH mapping
type to be applied in the PUSCH transmission and the *K~2~* value is
determined as , where are the corresponding list entries of the higher
layer parameter

\- *reportSlotOffsetListDCI-0-2*, if PUSCH is scheduled by DCI format
0\_2 and *reportSlotOffsetListDCI-0-2* is configured;

\- *reportSlotOffsetListDCI-0-1*, if PUSCH is scheduled by DCI format
0\_1 and *reportSlotOffsetListDCI-0-1* is configured;

\- *reportSlotOffsetList*, otherwise;

in *CSI-ReportConfig* for the triggered CSI Reporting Settings and is
the *(m+1)*th entry of .

\- The slot *K~s~* where the UE shall transmit the PUSCH is determined
by *K~2~* as *K~s\ ~*=, if UE is configured with *ca-SlotOffset* for at
least one of the scheduled and scheduling cell,
*K~s\ ~*=![](media/image717.wmf){width="1.0284722222222222in"
height="0.5145833333333333in"}, otherwise, and where *n* is the slot
with the scheduling DCI, K*~2~* is based on the numerology of PUSCH, and
and are the subcarrier spacing configurations for PUSCH and PDCCH,
respectively,

\- $N_{\text{slot,\ offset,\ }\text{PDCCH}}^{\text{CA}}$ and
$\mu_{\text{offset}\text{,}\text{PDCCH}}\ $are
the$\text{\ N}_{\text{slot,\ offset}}^{\text{CA}}$ and the,
respectively, which are determined by higher-layer configured
*ca-SlotOffset* for the cell receiving the
PDCCH,$\ N_{\text{slot,\ offset,\ }\text{PU}\text{S}\text{CH}}^{\text{CA}}$ and$\ \mu_{\text{offset}\text{,}\text{P}\text{U}\text{SCH}}$
are the $N_{\text{slot,\ offset}}^{\text{CA}}$ and the,respectively,
which are determined by higher-layer configured *ca-SlotOffset* for the
cell transmitting the PUSCH, as defined in clause 4.5 of \[4, TS
38.211\], and

\- for PUSCH scheduled by DCI format 0\_1, if
*pusch-RepTypeIndicatorDCI-0-1* is set to \'*pusch-RepTypeB*\', the UE
applies PUSCH repetition Type B procedure when determining the time
domain resource allocation. For PUSCH scheduled by DCI format 0\_2, if
*pusch-RepTypeIndicatorDCI-0-2* is set to \'*pusch-RepTypeB*\', the UE
applies PUSCH repetition Type B procedure when determining the time
domain resource allocation. Otherwise, the UE applies PUSCH repetition
Type A procedure when determining the time domain resource allocation
for PUSCH scheduled by PDCCH, by RAR UL grant, or by fallbackRAR UL
grant.

\- For PUSCH repetition Type A, the starting symbol *S* relative to the
start of the slot, and the number of consecutive symbols *L* counting
from the symbol *S* allocated for the PUSCH are determined from the
start and length indicator *SLIV* of the indexed row:

> if then
>
> else
>
> where, and

\- For PUSCH repetition Type B, the starting symbol *S* relative to the
start of the slot, and the number of consecutive symbols *L* counting
from the symbol *S* allocated for the PUSCH are provided by
*startSymbol* and *length* of the indexed row of the resource allocation
table, respectively.

\- For PUSCH repetition Type A, the PUSCH mapping type is set to Type A
or Type B as defined in Clause 6.4.1.1.3 of \[4, TS 38.211\] as given by
the indexed row.

\- For PUSCH repetition Type B, the PUSCH mapping type is set to Type B.

The UE shall consider the *S* and *L* combinations defined in table
6.1.2.1-1 as valid PUSCH allocations

Table 6.1.2.1-1: Valid *S* and *L* combinations

  PUSCH mapping type                Normal cyclic prefix   Extended cyclic prefix

For PUSCH repetition Type A, when transmitting PUSCH scheduled by DCI
format 0\_1 or 0\_2 in PDCCH with CRC scrambled with C-RNTI, MCS-C-RNTI,
or CS-RNTI with NDI=1, the number of repetitions *K* is determined as

\- if *numberOfRepetitions* is present in the resource allocation table,
the number of repetitions K is equal to *numberOfRepetitions*;

\- elseif the UE is configured with *pusch-AggregationFactor*, the
number of repetitions *K* is equal to *pusch-AggregationFactor*;

\- otherwise *K=1*.

If a UE is configured with higher layer parameter
*pusch-TimeDomainAllocationListForMultiPUSCH*, the UE does not expect to
be configured with *pusch-AggregationFactor.*

For PUSCH repetition Type A, in case *K\>1,* the same symbol allocation
is applied across the *K* consecutive slots and the PUSCH is limited to
a single transmission layer. The UE shall repeat the TB across the *K*
consecutive slots applying the same symbol allocation in each slot. The
redundancy version to be applied on the *n*th transmission occasion of
the TB, where n = 0, 1, ... *K*-1, is determined according to table
6.1.2.1-2.

When transmitting MsgA PUSCH on a non-initial UL BWP, if the UE is
configured with *startSymbolAndLengthMsgA-PO*, the UE shall determine
the *S* and *L* from *startSymbolAndLengthMsgA-PO*.

When transmitting MsgA PUSCH, if the UE is not configured with
*startSymbolAndLengthMsgA-PO*, and if the TDRA list
*PUSCH-TimeDomainResourceAllocationList* is provided in
*PUSCH-ConfigCommon*, the UE shall use *msgA-PUSCH-TimeDomainAllocation*
to indicate which values are used in the list. If
*PUSCH-TimeDomainResourceAllocationList* is not provided in
*PUSCH-ConfigCommon*, the UE shall use parameters *S* and *L* from table
6.1.2.1.1-2 or table 6.1.2.1.1-3 where *msgA-PUSCH-TimeDomainAllocation*
indicates which values are used in the list. The time offset for PUSCH
transmission is described in \[6, TS38.213\].

For PUSCH repetition Type A, a PUSCH transmission in a slot of a
multi-slot PUSCH transmission is omitted according to the conditions in
Clause 9, Clause 11.1, Clause 11.2A and Clause 15 of \[6, TS38.213\].

For PUSCH repetition Type B, except for PUSCH transmitting CSI report(s)
with no transport block, the number of nominal repetitions is given by
*numberOfRepetitions*. For the *n*-th nominal repetition, *n* = *0*,
..., *numberOfRepetitions* - 1,

\- The slot where the nominal repetition starts is given by , and the
starting symbol relative to the start of the slot is given by .

\- The slot where the nominal repetition ends is given by , and the
ending symbol relative to the start of the slot is given by .

Here is the slot where the PUSCH transmission starts, and is the number
of symbols per slot as defined in Clause 4.3.2 of \[4, TS38.211\].

For PUSCH repetition Type B, the UE determines invalid symbol(s) for
PUSCH repetition Type B transmission as follows:

\- A symbol that is indicated as downlink by
*tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon* or *tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated* is
considered as an invalid symbol for PUSCH repetition Type B
transmission.

\- For operation in unpaired spectrum, symbols indicated by
*ssb-PositionsInBurst* in SIB1 or *ssb-PositionsInBurst* in
*ServingCellConfigCommon* for reception of SS/PBCH blocks are considered
as invalid symbols for PUSCH repetition Type B transmission.

\- For operation in unpaired spectrum, symbol(s) indicated by
*pdcch-ConfigSIB1* in *MIB* for a CORESET for Type0-PDCCH CSS set are
considered as invalid symbol(s) for PUSCH repetition Type B
transmission.

\- For operation in unpaired spectrum, if
*numberOfInvalidSymbolsForDL-UL-Switching* is configured,
*numberOfInvalidSymbolsForDL-UL-Switching* symbol(s) after the last
symbol that is indicated as downlink in each consecutive set of all
symbols that are indicated as downlink by
*tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon* or *tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated*
are considered as invalid symbol(s) for PUSCH repetition Type B
transmission. The symbol(s) given by
*numberOfInvalidSymbolsForDL-UL-Switching* are defined using the
reference SCS configuration *referenceSubcarrierSpacing* provided in
*tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon*.

\- The UE may be configured with the higher layer parameter
*invalidSymbolPattern*, which provides a symbol level bitmap spanning
one or two slots (higher layer parameter *symbols* given by
*invalidSymbolPattern*). A bit value equal to 1 in the symbol level
bitmap *symbols* indicates that the corresponding symbol is an invalid
symbol for PUSCH repetition Type B transmission. The UE may be
additionally configured with a time-domain pattern (higher layer
parameter *periodicityAndPattern* given by *invalidSymbolPattern*),
where each bit of *periodicityAndPattern* corresponds to a unit equal to
a duration of the symbol level bitmap *symbols*, and a bit value equal
to 1 indicates that the symbol level bitmap *symbols* is present in the
unit. The *periodicityAndPattern* can be {1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 20 or 40}
units long, but maximum of 40 msec. The first symbol of
*periodicityAndPattern* every 40 msec/P periods is a first symbol in
frame 𝑛𝑓 mod 4 = 0, where P is the duration of
*periodicityAndPattern-r16* in units of msec. When
*periodicityAndPattern* is not configured, for a symbol level bitmap
spanning two slots, the bits of the first and second slots correspond
respectively to even and odd slots of a radio frame, and for a symbol
level bitmap spanning one slot, the bits of the slot correspond to every
slot of a radio frame. If *invalidSymbolPattern* is configured, when the
UE applies the invalid symbol pattern is determined as follows:

\- if the PUSCH is scheduled by DCI format 0\_1, or corresponds to a
Type 2 configured grant activated by DCI format 0\_1, and if
*invalidSymbolPatternIndicatorDCI-0-1* is configured,

\- if invalid symbol pattern indicator field is set 1, the UE applies
the invalid symbol pattern;

\- otherwise, the UE does not apply the invalid symbol pattern;

\- if the PUSCH is scheduled by DCI format 0\_2, or corresponds to a
Type 2 configured grant activated by DCI format 0\_2, and if
*invalidSymbolPatternIndicatorDCI-0-2* is configured,

\- if invalid symbol pattern indicator field is set 1, the UE applies
the invalid symbol pattern;

\- otherwise, the UE does not apply the invalid symbol pattern;

\- otherwise, the UE applies the invalid symbol pattern.

\- If the UE

\- is configured with multiple serving cells within a cell group and is
provided with *directionalCollisionHandling-r16* = \'enabled\' for a set
of serving cell(s) among the multiple serving cells, and

\- indicates support of *half-DuplexTDD-CA-SameSCS-r16* capability, and

\- is not configured to monitor PDCCH for detection of DCI format 2-0 on
any of the multiple serving cells,

\- a symbol indicated to the UE for reception of SS/PBCH blocks in a
first cell of the multiple serving cells by *ssb-PositionsInBurst* in
*SIB1* or *ssb-PositionsInBurst* in *ServingCellConfigCommon is
considered as an invalid symbol for PUSCH repetition Type B transmission
in*

\- any of the multiple serving cells if the UE is not capable of
simultaneous transmission and reception as indicated by
*simultaneousRxTxInterBandCA* among the multiple serving cells, and

\- any one of the cells corresponding to the same band as the first
cell, irrespective of any capability indicated by
*simultaneousRxTxInterBandCA*

and

\- a symbol is considered as an invalid symbol in another cell among the
set of serving cell(s) provided with
***directionalCollisionHandling-r16*** for PUSCH repetition Type B
transmission with Type 1 or Type 2 configured grant except for the first
Type 2 PUSCH transmission (including all repetitions) after activation
if the symbol is indicated as downlink by
*tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon* or *tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationDedicated* on
the reference cell as defined in Clause 11.1 of \[6, TS 38.213\], or the
UE is configured by higher layers to receive PDCCH, PDSCH, or CSI-RS on
the reference cell in the symbol.

For PUSCH repetition Type B, after determining the invalid symbol(s) for
PUSCH repetition type B transmission for each of the *K* nominal
repetitions, the remaining symbols are considered as potentially valid
symbols for PUSCH repetition Type B transmission. If the number of
potentially valid symbols for PUSCH repetition type B transmission is
greater than zero for a nominal repetition, the nominal repetition
consists of one or more actual repetitions, where each actual repetition
consists of a consecutive set of all potentially valid symbols that can
be used for PUSCH repetition Type B transmission within a slot. An
actual repetition with a single symbol is omitted except for the case of
*L*=1. An actual repetition is omitted according to the conditions in
Clause 9, Clause 11.1, Clause 11.2A and Clause 15 of \[6, TS38.213\].
The UE shall repeat the TB across actual repetitions. The redundancy
version to be applied on the *n*th actual repetition (with the counting
including the actual repetitions that are omitted) is determined
according to table 6.1.2.1-2.

For PUSCH repetition Type B, when a UE receives a DCI that schedules
aperiodic CSI report(s) or activates semi-persistent CSI report(s) on
PUSCH with no transport block by a \'*CSI request\'* field on a DCI, the
number of nominal repetitions is always assumed to be 1, regardless of
the value of *numberOfRepetitions*. When the UE is scheduled to transmit
a PUSCH repetition Type B with no transport block and with aperiodic or
semi-persistent CSI report(s) by a \'*CSI request\'* field on a DCI, the
first nominal repetition is expected to be the same as the first actual
repetition. For PUSCH repetition Type B carrying semi-persistent CSI
report(s) without a corresponding PDCCH after being activated on PUSCH
by a \'*CSI request\'* field on a DCI, if the first nominal repetition
is not the same as the first actual repetition, the first nominal
repetition is omitted; otherwise, the first nominal repetition is
omitted according to the conditions in Clause 9, Clause 11.1, Clause
11.2A and Clause 15 of \[6, TS38.213\].

For PUSCH repetition Type B, when a UE is scheduled to transmit a
transport block and aperiodic CSI report(s) on PUSCH by a \'*CSI
request\'* field on a DCI, the CSI report(s) is multiplexed only on the
first actual repetition. The UE does not expect that the first actual
repetition has a single symbol duration.

If *pusch-TimeDomainAllocationListForMultiPUSCH* in *pusch-Config*
contains row indicating resource allocation for two to eight contiguous
PUSCHs, *K~2~* indicates the slot where UE shall transmit the first
PUSCH of the multiple PUSCHs. **Each PUSCH has a separate SLIV and
mapping type. The number of scheduled PUSCHs is signalled by the number
of indicated valid SLIVs in the row of the**
*pusch-TimeDomainAllocationListForMultiPUSCH* **signalled in DCI format
0\_1.**

When the UE is configured with *minimumSchedulingOffsetK2* in an active
UL BWP it applies a minimum scheduling offset restriction indicated by
the \'*Minimum applicable scheduling offset indicator*\' field in DCI
format 0\_1 or DCI format 1\_1 if the same field is available. When the
UE is configured with *minimumSchedulingOffsetK2* in an active UL BWP
and it has not received \'*Minimum applicable scheduling offset
indicator*\' field in DCI format 0\_1 or 1\_1, the UE shall apply a
minimum scheduling offset restriction indicated based on \'*Minimum
applicable scheduling offset indicator*\' value \'0\'. When the minimum
scheduling offset restriction is applied the UE is not expected to be
scheduled with a DCI in slot *n* to transmit a PUSCH scheduled with
C-RNTI, CS-RNTI, MCS-C-RNTI or SP-CSI-RNTI with *K*~2~ smaller than
$\left\lceil K_{2min} \cdot \frac{2^{\mu^{'}}}{2^{\mu}} \right\rceil$,
where *K*~2min~ and $\mu$ are the applied minimum scheduling offset
restriction and the numerology of the active UL BWP of the scheduled
cell when receiving the DCI in slot *n*, respectively, and $\mu^{'}$ is
the numerology of the new active UL BWP in case of active UL BWP change
in the scheduled cell and is equal to $\mu$, otherwise. The minimum
scheduling offset restriction is not applied when PUSCH transmission is
scheduled by RAR UL grant or fallbackRAR UL grant for RACH procedure, or
when PUSCH is scheduled with TC-RNTI. The application delay of the
change of the minimum scheduling offset restriction is determined in
Clause 5.3.1.

##### 6.1.2.1.1 Determination of the resource allocation table to be used for PUSCH

Table 6.1.2.1.1-1, Table 6.1.2.1.1-1A and Table 6.1.2.1.1-1B define
which PUSCH time domain resource allocation configuration to apply.

Table 6.1.2.1.1-4 defines the subcarrier spacing specific values *j*.
*j* is used in determination of *K~2~* in conjunction to table
6.1.2.1.1-2, for normal CP or table 6.1.2.1.1.-3 for extended CP, where
$µ_{\text{PUSCH}}$ is the subcarrier spacing configurations for PUSCH.

Table 6.1.2.1.1-5 defines the additional subcarrier spacing specific
slot delay value for the first transmission of PUSCH scheduled by the
RAR or by the fallbackRAR. When the UE transmits a PUSCH scheduled by
RAR or by the fallbackRAR, the *Δ* value specific to the PUSCH
subcarrier spacing *µ~PUSCH~* is applied in addition to the *K~2~*
value.

#### 6.1.2.2 Resource allocation in frequency domain

The UE shall determine the resource block assignment in frequency domain
using the resource allocation field in the detected PDCCH DCI except for
a PUSCH transmission scheduled by a RAR UL grant or fallbackRAR UL
grant, in which case the frequency domain resource allocation is
determined according to clause 8.3 of \[6, 38.213\] or a MsgA PUSCH
transmission with frequency domain resource allocation determined
according to clause 8.1A of \[6, 38.213\]. Three uplink resource
allocation schemes type 0, type 1 and type 2 are supported. Uplink
resource allocation scheme type 0 is supported for PUSCH only when
transform precoding is disabled. Uplink resource allocation scheme type
1 and type 2 are supported for PUSCH for both cases when transform
precoding is enabled or disabled.

If the scheduling DCI is configured to indicate the uplink resource
allocation type as part of the \'*Frequency domain resource\'*
assignment field by setting a higher layer parameter
r*esourceAllocation* in *pusch-Config* to \'dynamicSwitch\', for DCI
format 0\_1 or setting a higher layer parameter
*resourceAllocationDCI-0-2* in *pusch-Config* to \'dynamicSwitch\' for
DCI format 0\_2, the UE shall use uplink resource allocation type 0 or
type 1 as defined by this DCI field. Otherwise the UE shall use the
uplink frequency resource allocation type as defined by the higher layer
parameter *resourceAllocation* for DCI format 0\_1 or the higher layer
parameter *resourceAllocationDCI-0-2* for DCI format 0\_2. The UE shall
assume that when the scheduling PDCCH is received with DCI format 0\_1
and *useInterlacePUCCH-PUSCH in BWP-UplinkDedicated is configured*,
uplink type 2 resource allocation is used.

The UE shall assume that when the scheduling PDCCH is received with DCI
format 0\_0, then uplink resource allocation type 1 is used, except when
any of the higher layer parameters *useInterlacePUCCH-PUSCH in
BWP-UplinkCommon and useInterlacePUCCH-PUSCH in BWP-UplinkDedicated is
configured* in which case uplink resource allocation type 2 is used.

The UE expects that either none or both of *useInterlacePUCCH-PUSCH in
BWP-UplinkCommon and useInterlacePUCCH-PUSCH in BWP-UplinkDedicated is
configured*.

If a bandwidth part indicator field is not configured in the scheduling
DCI or the UE does not support active bandwidth part change via DCI, the
RB indexing for uplink type 0, type 1 and type 2 resource allocation is
determined within the UE\'s active bandwidth part. If a bandwidth part
indicator field is configured in the scheduling DCI and the UE supports
active bandwidh part change via DCI, the RB indexing for uplink type 0,
type 1, type 2 resource allocation is determined within the UE\'s
bandwidth part indicated by bandwidth part indicator field value in the
DCI. The UE shall upon detection of PDCCH intended for the UE determine
first the uplink bandwidth part and then the resource allocation within
the bandwidth part. RB numbering starts from the lowest RB in the
determined uplink bandwidth part.

##### 6.1.2.2.1 Uplink resource allocation type 0

In uplink resource allocation of type 0, the resource block assignment
information includes a bitmap indicating the Resource Block Groups
(RBGs) that are allocated to the scheduled UE where a RBG is a set of
consecutive virtual resource blocks defined by higher layer parameter
*rbg-Size* configured in *pusch-Config* and the size of the bandwidth
part as defined in Table 6.1.2.2.1-1.

Table 6.1.2.2.1-1: Nominal RBG size *P*

  Bandwidth Part Size   Configuration 1   Configuration 2
  --------------------- ----------------- -----------------
  1 -- 36               *2*               4
  37 -- 72              4                 8
  73 -- 144             8                 16
  145 -- 275            16                16

The total number of RBGs () for a uplink bandwidth part *i* of sizePRBs
is given by where

\- the size of the first RBG is ,

\- the size of the last RBG is if and *P* otherwise.

\- the size of all other RBG is *P*.

The bitmap is of size bits with one bitmap bit per RBG such that each
RBG is addressable. The RBGs shall be indexed in the order of increasing
frequency of the bandwidth part and starting at the lowest frequency.
The order of RBG bitmap is such that RBG 0 to RBG are mapped from MSB to
LSB of the bitmap. The RBG is allocated to the UE if the corresponding
bit value in the bitmap is 1, the RBG is not allocated to the UE
otherwise.

In frequency range 1, only \'almost contiguous allocation\' defined in
\[8, TS 38.101-1\] is allowed as non-contiguous allocation per component
carrier for UL RB allocation for CP-OFDM.

In frequency range 2, non-contiguous allocation per component carrier
for UL RB allocation for CP-OFDM is not supported.

##### 6.1.2.2.2 Uplink resource allocation type 1

In uplink resource allocation of type 1, the resource block assignment
information indicates to a scheduled UE a set of contiguously allocated
non-interleaved virtual resource blocks within the active bandwidth part
of size PRBs except for the case when DCI format 0\_0 is decoded in any
common search space in which case the size of the initial UL bandwidth
part shall be used.

An uplink type 1 resource allocation field consists of a resource
indication value (*RIV*) corresponding to a starting virtual resource
block () and a length in terms of contiguously allocated resource
blocks. The resource indication value is defined by

if then

else

where≥ 1 and shall not exceed.

When the DCI size for DCI format 0\_0 in USS is derived from the initial
UL BWP with size but applied to another active BWP with size of , an
uplink type 1 resource block assignment field consists of a resource
indication value (*RIV*) corresponding to a starting resource block and
a length in terms of virtually contiguously allocated resource blocks .

The resource indication value is defined by

if then

else

where, and where shall not exceed .

If , *K* is the maximum value from set {1, 2, 4, 8} which satisfies ;
otherwise *K* = 1.

When the scheduling grant is received with DCI format 0\_2, an uplink
type 1 resource allocation field consists of a resource indication value
(*RIV*) corresponding to a starting resource block group *RBG~start~*=0,
1, ..., *N~RBG~*-1 and a length in terms of virtually contiguously
allocated resource block groups *L~RBGs~*=1, ..., *N~RBG~*, where the
resource block groups are defined as in 6.1.2.2.1 with *P* defined by
*resourceAllocationType1GranularityDCI-0-2* if the UE is configured with
higher layer parameter *resourceAllocationType1GranularityDCI-0-2*, and
*P=1 otherwise.* The resource indication value is defined by

if then

else

where≥ 1 and shall not exceed .

##### 6.1.2.2.3 Uplink resource allocation type 2

In uplink resource allocation of type 2, the resource block assignment
information defined in \[5, TS 38.212\] indicates to a UE a set of up to
*M* interlace indices, and for DCI 0\_0 monitored in a UE-specific
search space and DCI 0\_1 a set of up to
$\ N_{\text{RB}\text{-}set,UL}^{\text{BWP}}$ contiguous RB sets, where
*M* and interlace indexing are defined in Clause 4.4.4.6 in \[4, TS
38.211\]. Within the active UL BWP, the assigned physical resource block
$n$ is mapped to virtual resource block $\text{n.}$ For DCI 0\_0
monitored in a UE-specific search space and DCI 0\_1, the UE shall
determine the resource allocation in frequency domain as an intersection
of the resource blocks of the indicated interlaces and the union of the
indicated set of RB sets and intra-cell guard bands defined in Clause 7
between the indicated RB sets, if any. For DCI 0\_0 monitored in a
common search space, the UE shall determine the resource allocation in
frequency domain as an intersection of the resource blocks of the
indicated interlaces and a single uplink RB set of the active UL BWP.
For DCI 0\_0 monitored in a CSS with CRC scrambled by an RNTI other than
TC-RNTI, the uplink RB set is the lowest indexed one amongst uplink RB
set(s) that intersects the lowest-indexed CCE of the PDCCH in which the
UE detects the DCI 0\_0 in the active downlink BWP. If there is no
intersection, the uplink RB set is RB set 0 in the active uplink BWP.
For DCI 0\_0 with CRC scrambled by TC-RNTI, the uplink RB set is the
same one in which the UE transmits the PRACH associated with the RAR UL
grant, in which case the UE assumes that the uplink RB set is defined as
when the UE is not configured with *intraCellGuardBandsUL-List* (see
Clause 7).

For µ=0, the X=6 MSBs of the resource block assignment information
indicates to a UE a set of allocated interlace indices $m_{0} + l$,
where the indication consists of a resource indication value (*RIV*).
For $0 \leq RIV < M(M + 1)/2$ , $l = 0,1,\cdots L - 1$ the resource
indication value corresponds to the starting interlace index *m~0~* and
the number of contiguous interlace indices (). The resource indication
value is defined by:

if $(L - 1) \leq \left\lfloor M/2 \right\rfloor$ then

$$\text{RIV} = M(L - 1) + m_{0}$$

else

$$\text{RIV} = M(M - L + 1) + (M - 1 - m_{0})$$

For $\text{RIV} \geq M(M + 1)/2$ , the resource indication value
corresponds to the starting interlace index *m~0~* and the set of values
according to Table 6.1.2.2.3-1.

Table 6.1.2.2.3-1: *m~0~* and for
$\mathbf{\text{RIV}}\mathbf{\geq}\mathbf{M(M + 1)/2}$.

For µ=1, the X=5 MSBs of the resource block assignment information
comprise a bitmap indicating the interlaces that are allocated to the
scheduled UE. The bitmap is of size *M* bits with one bitmap bit per
interlace such that each interlace is addressable, where *M* and
interlace indexing is defined in Clause 4.4.4.6 in \[4, TS 38.211\]. The
order of interlace bitmap is such that interlace 0 to interlace $M - 1$
are mapped from MSB to LSB of the bitmap. An interlace is allocated to
the UE if the corresponding bit value in the bitmap is 1; otherwise the
interlace is not allocated to the UE.

For DCI 0\_0 monitored in a UE-specific search space and DC 0\_1 for
both µ=0 and µ=1, the
$Y = \left\lceil \text{log}_{2}\frac{N_{\text{RB}\text{-}set,UL}^{\text{BWP}}\left( N_{\text{RB}\text{-}set,UL}^{\text{BWP}} + 1 \right)}{2} \right\rceil\text{LSBs\ of\ }$
the resource block assignment information indicate to a UE a set of
contiguously allocated RB sets for PUSCH scheduled by DCI 0\_0 monitored
in a UE-specific search space, DCI 0\_1 and Type 1 and Type 2 configured
grant. The resource allocation field consists of a resource indication
value ($\text{RIV}_{\text{RB} - \text{set}}$). For
$0 \leq \text{RIV}_{\text{RB} - \text{set}} < N_{\text{RB}\text{-}set,UL}^{\text{BWP}}(N_{\text{RB}\text{-}set,UL}^{\text{BWP}} + 1)/2$
, $l = 0,1,\cdots L_{\text{RBset}} - 1$ the resource indication value
corresponds to the starting RB set index
$N_{\text{RB-set,UL}}^{\text{start}}$ and the number of contiguous RB
sets $\ L_{RB - set}\ $. The resource indication value is defined by;

if
$(L_{RB - set} - 1) \leq \left\lfloor N_{\text{RB}\text{-}set,UL}^{\text{BWP}}/2 \right\rfloor$
then

$\text{RIV}_{RB - set} = N_{\text{RB}\text{-}set,UL}^{\text{BWP}}(L_{RB - set} - 1) + N_{\text{RB-set,UL}}^{\text{start}}$

else

$\text{RIV}_{RB - set} = N_{\text{RB}\text{-}set,UL}^{\text{BWP}}(N_{\text{RB}\text{-}set,UL}^{\text{BWP}} - L_{RB - set} + 1) + (N_{\text{RB}\text{-}set,UL}^{\text{BWP}} - 1 - N_{\text{RB-set,UL}}^{\text{start}})$

where
$\ N_{\text{RB-set,UL}}^{\text{start}} = 0,1,\cdots N_{\text{RB}\text{-}set,UL}^{\text{BWP}} - 1$,
$L_{RB - set} \geq 1$ and shall not exceed
$N_{\text{RB}\text{-}set,UL}^{\text{BWP}} - N_{\text{RB-set,UL}}^{\text{start}}$

If transform precoding is enabled according to the procedure in Clause
6.1.3, then the UE transmits PUSCH on the lowest-indexed
$M_{\text{RB}}^{\text{PUSCH}}$ PRBs amongst the PRBs indicated by the
frequency domain resource assignment information.
$M_{\text{RB}}^{\text{PUSCH}}$ is the largest integer not greater than
the number of RBs indicated by the frequency domain resource assignment
information that fulfils the conditions in Clause 6.3.1.4 of \[4, TS
38.211\].

#### 6.1.2.3 Resource allocation for uplink transmission with configured grant

When PUSCH resource allocation is semi-statically configured by higher
layer parameter *configuredGrantConfig in BWP-UplinkDedicated
information element*, and the PUSCH transmission corresponding to a
configured grant, the following higher layer parameters are applied in
the transmission:

\- For Type 1 PUSCH transmissions with a configured grant, the following
parameters are given in *configuredGrantConfig* unless mentioned
otherwise:

\- For the determination of the PUSCH repetition type, if the higher
layer parameter *pusch-RepTypeIndicator* in *rrc-ConfiguredUplinkGrant*
is configured and set to \'pusch-RepTypeB\', PUSCH repetition type B is
applied; otherwise, PUSCH repetition type A is applied;

\- For PUSCH repetition type A, the selection of the time domain
resource allocation table follows the rules for DCI format 0\_0 on UE
specific search space, as defined in Clause 6.1.2.1.1.

\- For PUSCH repetition type B, the selection of the time domain
resource allocation table is as follows:

\- If *pusch-RepTypeIndicatorDCI-0-1* in *pusch-Config* is configured
and set to *\'*pusch-RepTypeB*\'*,
*pusch-TimeDomainAllocationListDCI-0-1* in *pusch-Config* is used;

\- Otherwise, *pusch-TimeDomainAllocationListDCI-0-2* in *pusch-Config*
is used.

\- It is not expected that *pusch-RepTypeIndicator* in
*rrc-ConfiguredUplinkGrant* is configured with *\'*pusch-RepTypeB*\'*
when none of *pusch-RepTypeIndicatorDCI-0-1* and
*pusch-RepTypeIndicatorDCI-0-2* in *pusch-Config* is set to
*\'*pusch-RepTypeB*\'*.

\- The higher layer parameter *timeDomainAllocation* value *m* provides
a row index *m*+1 pointing to the determined time domain resource
allocation table, where the start symbol and length are determined
following the procedure defined in Clause 6.1.2.1;

\- Frequency domain resource allocation is determined by the *N* LSB
bits in the higher layer parameter *frequencyDomainAllocation*, forming
a bit sequence $f_{17},\ \ldots,\ f_{1},\ f_{0}$, where $f_{0}$ is the
LSB, according to the procedure in Clause 6.1.2.2 and *N* is determined
as the size of frequency domain resource assignment field in DCI format
0\_1 for a given resource allocation type indicated by
*resourceAllocation,* except if *useInterlacePUCCH-PUSCH in
BWP-UplinkDedicated is configured*, in which case uplink type 2 resource
allocation is used wherein the UE interprets the LSB bits in the higher
layer parameter *frequencyDomainAllocation* as for the frequency domain
resource assignment field of DCI 0\_1 according to the procedure in
Clause 6.1.2.2.3*;*

\- The *I~MCS~* is provided by higher layer parameter *mcsAndTBS;*

\- Number of DM-RS CDM groups, DM-RS ports, SRS resource indication and
DM-RS sequence initialization are determined as in Clause 7.3.1.1.2 of
\[5, TS 38.212\], and the antenna port value, the bit value for DM-RS
sequence initialization, precoding information and number of layers, SRS
resource indicator are provided by *antennaPort, dmrs-SeqInitialization,
precodingAndNumberOfLayers*, and *srs-ResourceIndicator* respectively;

\- When frequency hopping is enabled, the frequency offset between two
frequency hops can be configured by higher layer parameter
*frequencyHoppingOffset.*

\- For Type 2 PUSCH transmissions with a configured grant: the resource
allocation follows the higher layer configuration according to \[10, TS
38.321\], and UL grant received on the DCI.

\- The PUSCH repetition type and the time domain resource allocation
table are determined by the PUSCH repetition type and the time domain
resource allocation table associated with the UL grant received on the
DCI, respectively, as defined in Clause 6.1.2.1.

For PUSCH transmissions with a Type 1 or Type 2 configured grant, the
number of (nominal) repetitions *K* to be applied to the transmitted
transport block is provided by the indexed row in the time domain
resource allocation table if *numberOfRepetitions* is present in the
table; otherwise *K* is provided by the higher layer configured
parameters *repK.*

The UE shall not transmit anything on the resources configured by
*configuredGrantConfig* if the higher layers did not deliver a transport
block to transmit on the resources allocated for uplink transmission
without grant.

A set of allowed periodicities *P* are defined in \[12, TS 38.331\]. The
higher layer parameter *cg-nrofSlots*, provides the number of
consecutive slots allocated within a configured grant period. The higher
layer parameter *cg-nrofPUSCH-InSlot* provides the number of consecutive
PUSCH allocations within a slot, where the first PUSCH allocation
follows the higher layer parameter *timeDomainAllocation* for Type 1
PUSCH transmission or the higher layer configuration according to \[10,
TS 38.321\], and UL grant received on the DCI for Type 2 PUSCH
transmissions, and the remaining PUSCH allocations have the same length
and PUSCH mapping type, and are appended following the previous
allocations without any gaps. The same combination of start symbol and
length and PUSCH mapping type repeats over the consecutively allocated
slots.

For operation with shared spectrum channel access where a UE is
performing uplink transmission with configured grants in contiguous OFDM
symbols on all resource blocks of an RB set, for the first such UL
transmission the UE determines a duration of a cyclic prefix extension
*T~ext~* to be applied for transmission according to \[4, TS 38.211\]
where the index for $\Delta_{i}$ \[4, TS 38.211\] is chosen randomly
from a set of values configured by higher layers according to the
following rule:

\- If the first such UL transmission is within a channel occupancy
initiated by the gNB (defined in Clause 4 of \[16, TS 37.213\]), the set
of values is determined by *cg-StartingFullBW-InsideCOT*;

\- otherwise, the set of values is determined by
*cg-StartingFullBW-OutsideCOT*.

For operation with shared spectrum channel access where a UE is
performing uplink transmission with configured grants in contiguous OFDM
symbols on fewer than all resource blocks of an RB set, for the first
such UL transmission the UE determines a duration of a cyclic prefix
extension *T~ext~* to be applied for transmission according to \[4, TS
38.211\] according to the following rule:

\- If the first such UL transmission is within a channel occupancy
initiated by the gNB (defined in Clause 4 of \[16, TS 37.213\]), the
index for $\Delta_{i}$ \[4, TS 38.211\] is equal to
*cg-StartingPartialBW-InsideCOT*;

\- otherwise, the index for $\Delta_{i}$ \[4, TS 38.211\] is equal to
*cg-StartingPartialBW-OutsideCOT.*

6.1.2.3.1 Transport Block repetition for uplink transmissions of PUSCH
repetition Type A with a configured grant

The procedures described in this clause apply to PUSCH transmissions of
PUSCH repetition Type A with a Type 1 or Type 2 configured grant.

The higher layer parameter *repK-RV* defines the redundancy version
pattern to be applied to the repetitions. If *cg-RetransmissionTimer* is
provided, the redundancy version for uplink transmission with a
configured grant is determined by the UE. If the parameter *repK-RV* is
not provided in the *configuredGrantConfig* and *cg-RetransmissionTimer*
is not provided, the redundancy version for uplink transmissions with a
configured grant shall be set to 0. If the parameter *repK-RV* is
provided in the *configuredGrantConfig* and *cg-RetransmissionTimer* is
not provided, for the *n*th transmission occasion among *K* repetitions,
*n*=1, 2, ..., *K*, it is associated with *(mod(n-1,4)+1)^th^* value in
the configured RV sequence. If a configured grant configuration is
configured with *startingFromRV0* set to *\'off\'*, the initial
transmission of a transport block may only start at the first
transmission occasion of the *K* repetitions. Otherwise, the initial
transmission of a transport block may start at

\- the first transmission occasion of the *K* repetitions if the
configured RV sequence is {0,2,3,1},

\- any of the transmission occasions of the *K* repetitions that are
associated with RV=0 if the configured RV sequence is {0,3,0,3},

\- any of the transmission occasions of the *K* repetitions if the
configured RV sequence is {0,0,0,0}, except the last transmission
occasion when *K≥8*.

For any RV sequence, the repetitions shall be terminated after
transmitting *K* repetitions, or at the last transmission occasion among
the *K* repetitions within the period *P*, or from the starting symbol
of the repetition that overlaps with a PUSCH with the same HARQ process
scheduled by DCI format 0\_0, 0\_1 or 0\_2, whichever is reached first.
In addition, the UE shall terminate the repetition of a transport block
in a PUSCH transmission if the UE receives a DCI format 0\_1 with DFI
flag provided and set to \'1\', and if in this DCI the UE detects ACK
for the HARQ process corresponding to that transport block.

The UE is not expected to be configured with the time duration for the
transmission of *K* repetitions larger than the time duration derived by
the periodicity *P*. If the UE determines that, for a transmission
occasion, the number of symbols available for the PUSCH transmission in
a slot is smaller than transmission duration *L*, the UE does not
transmit the PUSCH in the transmission occasion.

For both Type 1 and Type 2 PUSCH transmissions with a configured grant,
when *K \> 1,* the UE shall repeat the TB across the *K* consecutive
slots applying the same symbol allocation in each slot, except if the UE
is provided with higher layer parameters *cg-nrofSlots* and
*cg-nrofPUSCH-InSlot*, in which case the UE repeats the TB in the *repK*
earliest consecutive transmission occasion candidates within the same
configuration. A Type 1 or Type 2 PUSCH transmission with a configured
grant in a slot is omitted according to the conditions in Clause 9,
Clause 11.1, Clause 11.2A and Clause 15 of \[6, TS38.213\].

6.1.2.3.2 Transport Block repetition for uplink transmissions of PUSCH
repetition Type B with a configured grant

The procedures described in this Clause apply to PUSCH transmissions of
PUSCH repetition type B with a Type 1 or Type 2 configured grant.

For PUSCH transmissions with a Type 1 or Type 2 configured grant, the
nominal repetitions and the actual repetitions are determined according
to the procedures for PUSCH repetition Type B defined in Clause 6.1.2.1.
The higher layer configured parameters *repK-RV* defines the redundancy
version pattern to be applied to the repetitions. If the parameter
*repK-RV* is not provided in the *configuredGrantConfig*, the redundancy
version for each actual repetition with a configured grant shall be set
to 0. Otherwise, for the *n*th transmission occasion among all the
actual repetitions (including the actual repetitions that are omitted)
of the *K* nominal repetitions, it is associated with
*(mod(n-1,4)+1)^th^* value in the configured RV sequence. If a
configured grant configuration is configured with *startingFromRV0* set
to *\'off\'*, the initial transmission of a transport block may only
start at the first transmission occasion of the actual repetitions.
Otherwise, the initial transmission of a transport block may start at

\- the first transmission occasion of the actual repetitions if the
configured RV sequence is {0,2,3,1},

\- any of the transmission occasions of the actual repetitions that are
associated with RV=0 if the configured RV sequence is {0,3,0,3},

\- any of the transmission occasions of the actual repetitions if the
configured RV sequence is {0,0,0,0}, except the actual repetitions
within the last nominal repetition when *K≥8*.

For any RV sequence, the repetitions shall be terminated after
transmitting K nominal repetitions, or at the last transmission occasion
among the *K* nominal repetitions within the period *P*, or from the
starting symbol of an actual repetition that overlaps with a PUSCH with
the same HARQ process scheduled by DCI format 0\_0, 0\_1 or 0\_2,
whichever is reached first. The UE is not expected to be configured with
the time duration for the transmission of *K* nominal repetitions larger
than the time duration derived by the periodicity *P*.

### 6.1.3 UE procedure for applying transform precoding on PUSCH

For a PUSCH scheduled by RAR UL grant, or for a PUSCH scheduled by
fallbackRAR UL grant, or for a PUSCH scheduled by DCI format 0\_0 with
CRC scrambled by TC-RNTI, the UE shall consider the transform precoding
either \'enabled\' or \'disabled\' according to the higher layer
configured parameter *msg3-transformPrecoder.*

For a MsgA PUSCH, the UE shall consider the transform precoding either
\'enabled\' or \'disabled\' according to the higher layer configured
parameter *msgA-TransformPrecoder. If higher layer parameter
msgA-TransformPrecoder is not configured,* the UE shall consider the
transform precoding either \'enabled\' or \'disabled\' according to the
higher layer configured parameter *msg3-transformPrecoder.*

For PUSCH transmission scheduled by a PDCCH with CRC scrambled by
CS-RNTI with NDI=1, C-RNTI, or MCS-C-RNTI or SP-CSI-RNTI:

\- If the DCI with the scheduling grant was received with DCI format
0\_0, the UE shall, for this PUSCH transmission, consider the transform
precoding either enabled or disabled according to the higher layer
configured parameter *msg3-transformPrecoder*.

\- If the DCI with the scheduling grant was not received with DCI format
0\_0

\- If the UE is configured with the higher layer parameter
*transformPrecoder in pusch-Config*, the UE shall, for this PUSCH
transmission, consider the transform precoding either enabled or
disabled according to this parameter.

\- If the UE is not configured with the higher layer parameter
*transformPrecoder in pusch-Config*, the UE shall, for this PUSCH
transmission, consider the transform precoding either enabled or
disabled according to the higher layer configured parameter
*msg3-transformPrecoder*.

For PUSCH transmission with a configured grant

\- If the UE is configured with the higher layer parameter
*transformPrecoder in configuredGrantConfig*, the UE shall, for this
PUSCH transmission, consider the transform precoding either enabled or
disabled according to this parameter.

\- If the UE is not configured with the higher layer parameter
*transformPrecoder in configuredGrantConfig*, the UE shall, for this
PUSCH transmission, consider the transform precoding either enabled or
disabled according to the higher layer configured parameter
*msg3-transformPrecoder*.

### 6.1.4 Modulation order, redundancy version and transport block size determination

To determine the modulation order, target code rate, redundancy version
and transport block size for the physical uplink shared channel, the UE
shall first

\- read the 5-bit modulation and coding scheme field in the DCI
scheduling PUSCH or provided in a DCI activating a configured grant Type
2 PUSCH, or as provided by *mcsAndTBS* as described in Clause 6.1.2.3
for a configured grant Type 1 PUSCH to determine the modulation order
and target code rate (*R*) based on the procedure defined in Clause
6.1.4.1

\- read redundancy version field (*rv*) in the DCI to determine the
redundancy version for PUSCH scheduled by DCI, or determine the
redundancy version according to Clause 6.1.2.3.1 for configured grant
Type 1 and Type 2 PUSCH,

and second

\- use the number of layers , the total number of allocated PRBs to
determine the transport block size based on the procedure defined in
Clause 6.1.4.2.

When the UE is scheduled with multiple PUSCHs by a DCI, as described in
clause 6.1.2.1, the bits of *rv* field and NDI field, respectively, in
the DCI are one to one mapped to the scheduled PUSCH(s) with the
corresponding transport block(s) in the scheduled order where the LSB
bits of the *rv* field and NDI field, respectively, correspond to the
last scheduled PUSCH.

Within a cell group, a UE is not required to handle PUSCH(s)
transmissions in slot *s~j~* in serving cell-*j*, and for *j* = 0,1,2..
*J-1*, slot *s~j~* overlapping with any given point in time, if the
following condition is not satisfied at that point in time:

$\sum_{j = 0}^{J - 1}\frac{\sum_{m = 0}^{M - 1}V_{j,m}}{T_{\text{slot}}^{\mu(j)}} \leq \text{DataRate}$,

where

*- J* is the number of configured serving cells belong to a frequency
range

\- for the *j-th* serving cell,

*- M* is the number of TB(s) transmitted in slot-*s~j~*. For PUSCH
repetition Type B, each actual repetition is counted separately.

*- T~slot~^μ(j)^* =10^-3^/2^*μ(j*)^, where *μ(j)* is the numerology for
PUSCH(s) in slot *s~j~* of the *j*-th serving cell.

\- for the *m*-th TB,
$V_{j,m} = C' \bullet \left\lfloor \frac{A}{C} \right\rfloor$

*- A* is the number of bits in the transport block as defined in Clause
6.2.1 \[5, TS 38.212\]

*- C* *is the total number of code blocks for the transport block*
defined in Clause 5.2.2 \[5, TS 38.212\].$\ $

\- $C'$is the number of scheduled code blocks for the transport block as
defined in Clause 5.4.2.1 \[5,38.212\]

\- $\text{DataRate}$ \[Mbps\] is computed as the maximum data rate
summed over all the carriers in the frequency range for any signaled
band combination and feature set consistent with the configured servings
cells, where the data rate value is given by the formula in Clause 4.1.2
in \[13, TS 38.306\], including the scaling factor *f(i).*

For a *j*-th serving cell, if higher layer parameter
*processingType2Enabled* of *PUSCH-ServingCellConfig* is configured for
the serving cell and set to \'*enable\',* or if at least one *I~MCS~ \>
W* for [ ]{.underline} a PUSCH, where *W* = 28 for MCS tables 5.1.3.1-1
and 5.1.3.1-3, and *W* = 27 for MCS tables 5.1.3.1-2, 6.1.4.1-1, and
6.1.4.1-2, or if it is an actual repetition for PUSCH repetition Type B,
the UE is not required to handle PUSCH transmissions, if the following
condition is not satisfied:

$$\frac{\sum_{m = 0}^{M - 1}V_{j,m}}{L \times T_{s}^{\mu}} \leq \text{DataRateCC}$$

*where*

\- $\text{L\ }$is the number of symbols assigned to the PUSCH

\- *M* is the number of TB in the PUSCH

\-
$T_{s}^{\mu} = \frac{10^{- 3}}{{2^{\mu} \bullet N}_{\text{symb}}^{\text{slot}}}$
where μ is the numerology of the PUSCH

\- for the *m*-th TB,
$V_{j,m} = C' \bullet \left\lfloor \frac{A}{C} \right\rfloor$

\- *A* is the number of bits in the transport block as defined in Clause
6.2.1 \[5, TS 38.212\]

\- *C* is the total number of code blocks for the transport block
defined in Clause 5.2.2 \[5, TS 38.212\]

\- $C'$ is the number of scheduled code blocks for the transport block
as defined in Clause 5.4.2.1 \[5, TS 38.212\]

\- $\text{DataRateCC}$ \[Mbps\] is computed as the maximum data rate for
a carrier in the frequency band of the serving cell for any signaled
band combination and feature set consistent with the serving cell, where
the data rate value is given by the formula in Clause 4.1.2 in \[13, TS
38.306\], including the scaling factor *f(i)*

\- *each actual repetition for PUSCH repetition type B is treated as one
PUSCH.*

### 6.1.5 Code block group based PUSCH transmission

#### 6.1.5.1 UE procedure for grouping of code blocks to code block groups

If a UE is configured to transmit code block group (CBG) based
transmissions by receiving the higher layer parameter
*codeBlockGroupTransmission* in *PUSCH-ServingCellConfig*, the UE shall
determine the number of CBGs for a PUSCH transmission as

,

where *N* is the maximum number of CBGs per transport block as
configured by *maxCodeBlockGroupsPerTransportBlock* in
*PUSCH-ServingCellConfig*, and *C* is the number of code blocks in the
PUSCH according to the procedure defined in Clause 6.2.3 of \[5, TS
38.212\].

Define , , and .

If , CBG *m*, , consists of code blocks with indices . CBG *m*, ,
consists of code blocks with indices .

#### 6.1.5.2 UE procedure for transmitting code block group based transmissions

If a UE is configured to transmit code block group-based transmissions
by receiving the higher layer parameter *codeBlockGroupTransmission* in
*PUSCH-ServingCellConfig*,

\- For an initial transmission of a TB as indicated by the \'*New Data
Indicator\'* field of the scheduling DCI, the UE may expect that the
*CBGTI* field indicates all the CBGs of the TB are to be transmitted,
and the UE shall include all the code block groups of the TB.

\- For a retransmission of a TB as indicated by the \'*New Data
Indicator\'* field of the scheduling DCI, the UE shall include only the
CBGs indicated by the *CBGTI* field of the scheduling DCI.

A bit value of \'0\' in the *CBGTI* field indicates that the
corresponding CBG is not to be transmitted and \'1\' indicates that it
is to be transmitted. The order of *CBGTI* field bits is such that the
CBGs are mapped in order from CBG\#0 onwards starting from the MSB.

### 6.1.6 Uplink switching

The UE may omit uplink transmission during the uplink switching gap
$N_{\text{Tx1-Tx2}}$ if the conditions defined in this clause are met
and the UE is configured with *uplinkTxSwitching*. The switching gap
$N_{\text{Tx1-Tx2}}$ is indicated by UE capability
*uplinkTxSwitchingPeriod*:

\- If a UE indicated a capability for uplink switching with
*BandCombination-UplinkTxSwitch* for a band combination, and if it is
for that band combination

\- Configured with a MCG using E-UTRA radio access and with a SCG using
NR radio access (EN-DC), or

\- Configured with uplink carrier aggregation, or

\- Configured in a serving cell with two uplink carriers with higher
layer parameter *supplementaryUplink*.

The conditions under which the switching gap may be present are defined

respectively.

If an uplink switching is triggered for an uplink transmission starting
at *T~0~*, after *T~0~-T~offset~*, the UE is not expected to cancel the

before *T~0~* for any other uplink transmission that is scheduled after
*T~0~-T~offset~*, where *T~offset~* is the UE processing procedure time
defined for the uplink transmission triggering the switch given in
clause 5.3, clause 5.4, clause 6.2.1, clause 6.4 and in clause 9 of \[6,

The UE does not expect to perform more than one uplink switching in a
slot with *µ~UL\ ~*= max(*µ~UL,\ 1,~ µ~UL,\ 2~*), where the *µ~UL,\ 1~*
corresponds to the subcarrier spacing of the active UL BWP of one uplink
carrier before the switching gap and the *µ~UL,\ 2~* corresponds to the
subcarrier spacing of the active UL BWP of the other uplink carrier
after the switching gap.

6.2 UE reference signal (RS) procedure
--------------------------------------

### 6.2.1 UE sounding procedure

The UE may be configured with one or more Sounding Reference Signal
(SRS) resource sets as configured by the higher layer parameter
*SRS-ResourceSet* or *SRS-PosResourceSet*. For each SRS resource set
configured by *SRS-ResourceSet*, a UE may be configured with SRS
resources (higher layer parameter *SRS-Resource*), where the maximum
value of K is indicated by UE capability \[13, 38.306\]. When SRS
resource set is configured with the higher layer parameter
*SRS-PosResourceSet,* a UE may be configured with *K* ≥1 SRS resources
(higher layer parameter *SRS-PosResource*), where the maximum value of K
is 16. The SRS resource set applicability is configured by the higher
layer parameter *usage* in *SRS-ResourceSet.* When the higher layer
parameter *usage* is set to \'beamManagement\'*,* only one SRS resource
in each of multiple SRS resource sets may be transmitted at a given time
instant, but the SRS resources in different SRS resource sets with the
same time domain behaviour in the same BWP may be transmitted
simultaneously.

For the SRS resource set(s) configured *in
srs-ResourceSetToAddModListDCI-0-2* with higher layer parameter *usage*
set to \'*antennaSwitching*\' or \'*beamManagement*\', the UE expects
the same SRS resource set(s) with the same *usage* being configured in
*srs-ResourceSetToAddModList.*

For aperiodic SRS at least one state of the DCI field is used to select
at least one out of the configured SRS resource set(s).

The following SRS parameters are semi-statically configurable by higher
layer parameter *SRS-Resource* or *SRS-PosResource*.

*- srs-ResourceId* or *SRS-PosResourceId determines SRS resource
configuration identity.*

*-* Number of SRS ports, as defined by the higher layer parameter
*nrofSRS-Ports* and described in Clause 6.4.1.4 of \[4, TS 38.211\]. If
not configured, *nrofSRS-Ports* is 1.

*-* Time domain behaviour of SRS resource configuration as indicated by
the higher layer parameter *resourceType*, which may be periodic,
semi-persistent, aperiodic SRS transmission as defined in Clause 6.4.1.4
of \[4, TS 38.211\].

\- Slot level periodicity and slot level offset as defined by the higher
layer parameters *periodicityAndOffset-p* or *periodicityAndOffset-sp*
for an SRS resource of type periodic or semi-persistent. The UE is not
expected to be configured with SRS resources in the same SRS resource
set *SRS-ResourceSet* or *SRS-PosResourceSet* with different slot level
periodicities. For an *SRS-ResourceSet* configured with higher layer
parameter *resourceType* set to \'aperiodic\', a slot level offset is
defined by the higher layer parameter *slotOffset.* For an
*SRS-PosResourceSet configured w*ith higher layer parameter
r*esourceType* set to \'aperiodic\', the slot level offset is defined by
the higher layer parameter *slotOffset for each S*RS resource.

\- Number of OFDM symbols in the SRS resource, starting OFDM symbol of
the SRS resource within a slot including repetition factor R as defined
by the higher layer parameter *resourceMapping* and described in Clause
6.4.1.4 of \[4, TS 38.211\]. If *R* is not configured, then *R* is equal
to the number of OFDM symbols in the SRS resource.

\- SRS bandwidth and , as defined by the higher layer parameter
*freqHopping* and described in Clause 6.4.1.4 of \[4, TS 38.211\]. If
not configured, then= 0.

\- Frequency hopping bandwidth , as defined by the higher layer
parameter *freqHopping* and described in Clause 6.4.1.4 of \[4, TS
38.211\]. If not configured, then = 0.

\- Defining frequency domain position and configurable shift, as defined
by the higher layer parameters *freqDomainPosition* and
*freqDomainShift, respectively,* and described in Clause 6.4.1.4 of \[4,
TS 38.211\]. If *freqDomainPosition* is not configured,
*freqDomainPosition* is zero.

\- Cyclic shift, as defined by the higher layer parameter
*cyclicShift-n2*, *cyclicShift-n4, or cyclicShift-n8* for transmission
comb value 2, 4 or 8, and described in Clause 6.4.1.4 of \[4, TS
38.211\].

\- Transmission comb value, as defined by the higher layer parameter
*transmissionComb* described in Clause 6.4.1.4 of \[4, TS 38.211\].

\- Transmission comb offset, as defined by the higher layer parameter
*combOffset-n2*, *combOffset-n4,* and *combOffset-n8* for transmission
comb value 2, 4, or 8, and described in Clause 6.4.1.4 of \[4, TS
38.211\].

\- SRS sequence ID, as defined by the higher layer parameter
*sequenceId* in Clause 6.4.1.4 of \[4\].

\- The configuration of the spatial relation between a reference RS and
the target SRS, where the higher layer parameter *spatialRelationInfo*
or *spatialRelationInfoPos*, if configured, contains the ID of the
reference RS. The reference RS may be an SS/PBCH block, CSI-RS
configured on serving cell indicated by higher layer parameter
*servingCellId* if present, same serving cell as the target SRS
otherwise, or an SRS configured on uplink BWP indicated by the higher
layer parameter *uplinkBWP*, and serving cell indicated by the higher
layer parameter *servingCellId* if present, same serving cell as the
target SRS otherwise. When the target SRS is configured by the higher
layer parameter *SRS-PosResourceSet,* the reference RS may also be a DL
PRS configured on a serving cell or a non-serving cell indicated by the
higher layer parameter *dl-PRS*, or an SS/PBCH block of a non-serving
cell indicated by the higher layer parameter *ssb-Ncell*.

The UE may be configured by the higher layer parameter *resourceMapping*
in *SRS-Resource* with an SRS resource occupying adjacent OFDM symbols
within the last 6 symbols of the slot, or at any symbol location within
the slot if *resourceMapping-r16* is provided subject to UE capability,
where all antenna ports of the SRS resources are mapped to each symbol
of the resource. When the SRS is configured with the higher layer
parameter *SRS-PosResourceSet* the higher layer parameter
*resourceMapping-r16* in *SRS-PosResource* indicates an SRS resource
occupying $N_{S} \in \left\{ 1,2,4,8,12 \right\}$ adjacent symbols
anywhere within the slot.

If a PUSCH with a priority index 0 and SRS configured by *SRS-Resource*
are transmitted in the same slot on a serving cell, the UE may only be
configured to transmit SRS after the transmission of the PUSCH and the
corresponding DM-RS.

If a PUSCH transmission with a priority index 1 or a PUCCH transmission
with a priority index 1 would overlap in time with an SRS transmission
on a serving cell, the UE does not transmit the SRS in the overlapping
symbol(s).

*For a UE configured with one or more SRS resource configuration(s), and
when the higher layer parameter* *resourceType* in *SRS-Resource* or
*SRS-PosResource is set to \'periodic\':*

\- if the UE is configured with the higher layer parameter
*spatialRelationInfo* or *spatialRelationInfoPos* containing the ID of a
reference \'ssb-Index\', \'ssb-IndexServing\', or \'ssb-IndexNcell\',
the UE shall transmit the target SRS resource with the same spatial
domain transmission filter used for the reception of the reference
SS/PBCH block, if the higher layer parameter *spatialRelationInfo* or
*spatialRelationInfoPos* contains the ID of a reference \'csi-RS-Index\'
or \'csi-RS-IndexServing\', the UE shall transmit the target SRS
resource with the same spatial domain transmission filter used for the
reception of the reference periodic CSI-RS or of the reference
semi-persistent CSI-RS, if the higher layer parameter
*spatialRelationInfo* or *spatialRelationInfoPos* containing the ID of a
reference \'srs\' or \'srs-spatialRelation\', the UE shall transmit the
target SRS resource with the same spatial domain transmission filter
used for the transmission of the reference periodic SRS. When the SRS is
configured by the higher layer parameter *SRS-PosResource* and if the
higher layer parameter *spatialRelationInfoPos* contains the ID of a
reference \'dl-PRS\', the UE shall transmit the target SRS resource with
the same spatial domain transmission filter used for the reception of
the reference DL PRS.

*For a UE configured with one or more SRS resource configuration(s), and
when the higher layer parameter resourceType* in *SRS-Resource* or
*SRS-PosResource is set to \'semi-persistent\':*

\- when a UE receives an activation command, as described in clause
6.1.3.17 or 6.1.3.36 of \[10, TS 38.321\], for an SRS resource, and when
the UE would transmit a PUCCH with HARQ-ACK information in slot *n*
corresponding to the PDSCH carrying the activation command, the
corresponding actions in \[10, TS 38.321\] and the UE assumptions on SRS
transmission corresponding to the configured SRS resource set shall be
applied starting from the first slot that is after slot
$n + {3N}_{\text{slot}}^{subframe,µ}$ where *μ* is the SCS configuration
for the PUCCH. The activation command also contains spatial relation
assumptions provided by a list of references to reference signal IDs,
one per element of the activated SRS resource set. When the SRS is
configured with the higher layer parameter *SRS-ResourceSet*, each ID in
the list refers to a reference SS/PBCH block, NZP CSI-RS resource
configured on serving cell indicated by *Resource Serving Cell ID* field
in the activation command if present, same serving cell as the SRS
resource set otherwise, or SRS resource configured on serving cell and
uplink bandwidth part indicated by Resource *Serving Cell ID* field and
*Resource BWP ID* field in the activation command if present, same
serving cell and bandwidth part as the SRS resource set otherwise. When
the SRS is configured with the higher layer parameter
*SRS-PosResourceSet*, each ID in the list of reference signal IDs may
refer to a reference SS/PBCH block on a serving or non-serving cell
indicated by *PCI* field in the activation command, NZP CSI-RS resource
configured on serving cell indicated by *Resource Serving Cell ID* field
in the activation command if present, same serving cell as the SRS
resource set otherwise, SRS resource configured on serving cell and
uplink bandwidth part indicated by Resource *Serving Cell ID* field and
*Resource BWP ID* field in the activation command if present, same
serving cell and bandwidth part as the SRS resource set otherwise, or DL
PRS resource of a serving or non-serving cell associated with a
*dl-PRS-ID* indicated by *DL-PRS ID* field in the activation command.

\- if an SRS resource in the activated resource set is configured with
the higher layer parameter *spatialRelationInfo* or
*spatialRelationInfoPos*, the UE shall assume that the ID of the
reference signal in the activation command overrides the one configured
in *spatialRelationInfo* or *spatialRelationInfoPos.*

\- when a UE receives a deactivation command \[10, TS 38.321\] for an
activated SRS resource set, and when the UE would transmit a PUCCH with
HARQ-ACK information in slot *n* corresponding to the PDSCH carrying the
deactivation command, the corresponding actions in \[10, TS 38.321\] and
UE assumption on cessation of SRS transmission corresponding to the
deactivated SRS resource set shall apply starting from the first slot
that is after slot $n + {3N}_{\text{slot}}^{subframe,µ}$ where *μ* is
the SCS configuration for the PUCCH.

\- if the UE is configured with the higher layer parameter
*spatialRelationInfo* or *spatialRelationInfoPos* containing the ID of a
reference \'ssb-Index\', \'ssb-IndexServing\', or \'ssb-IndexNcell\' the
UE shall transmit the target SRS resource with the same spatial domain
transmission filter used for the reception of the reference SS/PBCH
block, if the higher layer parameter *spatialRelationInfo* or
*spatialRelationInfoPos* contains the ID of a reference \'csi-RS-Index\'
or \'csi-RS-IndexServing\', the UE shall transmit the target SRS
resource with the same spatial domain transmission filter used for the
reception of the reference periodic CSI-RS or of the reference
semi-persistent CSI-RS, if the higher layer parameter
*spatialRelationInfo* or *spatialRelationInfoPos* contains the ID of a
reference \'srs\' or \'srs-SpatialRelation\', the UE shall transmit the
target SRS resource with the same spatial domain transmission filter
used for the transmission of the reference periodic SRS or of the
reference semi-persistent SRS. When the SRS is configured by the higher
layer parameter *SRS-PosResourceSet* and if the higher layer parameter
*spatialRelationInfoPos* contains the ID of a reference \'dl-PRS\', the
UE shall transmit the target SRS resource with the same spatial domain
transmission filter used for the reception of the reference DL PRS.

If the UE has an active semi-persistent SRS resource configuration and
has not received a deactivation command, the semi-persistent SRS
configuration is considered to be active in the UL BWP which is active,
otherwise it is considered suspended.

For a UE configured with one or more SRS resource configuration(s), and
when the higher layer parameter *resourceType* in *SRS-Resource* or
*SRS-PosResource* is set to \'aperiodic\':

\- the UE receives a configuration of SRS resource sets,

\- the UE receives a downlink DCI, a group common DCI, or an uplink DCI
based command where a codepoint of the DCI may trigger one or more SRS
resource set(s). For SRS in a resource set with usage set to
\'codebook\' or \'antennaSwitching\', the minimal time interval between
the last symbol of the PDCCH triggering the aperiodic SRS transmission
and the first symbol of SRS resource is *N~2\ ~* symbols and an
additional time duration *T~switch~*. Otherwise, the minimal time
interval between the last symbol of the PDCCH triggering the aperiodic
SRS transmission and the first symbol of SRS resource is *N~2~* +14
symbols and an additional time duration *T~switch~*. The minimal time
interval unit of OFDM symbol is counted based on the minimum subcarrier
spacing given by min(*µ~PDCCH,~ µ~UL~*) where *µ~UL~* is given by
min(*µ~UL,carrier1,~ µ~UL,carrier2,~ µ~SRS~*) when the UE is configured
with the higher layer parameter *uplinkTxSwitchingOption set to
\'dualUL\' for uplink carrier aggregation*, *and by µ~SRS\ ~*otherwise.

higher-layer configured *ca-SlotOffset* for the cell transmitting the
SRS, as defined in \[4, TS 38.211\] clause 4.5.

\- If the UE receives the DCI triggering aperiodic SRS in slot *n* and
when SRS is configured with the higher layer parameter
*SRS-PosResource*, the UE transmits every aperiodic SRS resource in each
of the triggered SRS resource set(s) in slot , if UE is configured with

*- k* is configured via higher layer parameter *slotOffset* for each
aperiodic SRS resource in each triggered SRS resources set and is based
on the subcarrier spacing of the triggered SRS transmission, *µ~SRS~*

assumptions on updating spatial relation for the SRS resource shall be
applied for SRS transmission starting from the first slot that is after
slot $n + {3N}_{\text{slot}}^{subframe,µ}\ $where *μ* is the SCS
configuration for the PUCCH. The update command contains spatial
relation assumptions provided by a list of references to reference
signal IDs, one per element of the updated SRS resource set. Each ID in
the list refers to a reference SS/PBCH block, NZP CSI-RS resource
configured on serving cell indicated by *Resource Serving Cell ID* field
in the update command if present, same serving cell as the SRS resource
set otherwise, or SRS resource configured on serving cell and uplink
bandwidth part indicated by *Resource* *Serving Cell ID* field and
*Resource BWP ID* field in the update command if present, same serving

to be configured with different spatial relations for SRS resources in
the same SRS resource set.

The UE is not expected to be configured with different time domain
behavior for SRS resources in the same SRS resource set. The UE is also
not expected to be configured with different time domain behavior
between SRS resource and associated SRS resources set.

For operation in the same carrier, the UE is not expected to be

a SRS resource configured by the higher layer parameter *SRS-Resource*
with *resourceType* of both SRS resources as \'semi-persistent\' or

For operations in the same carrier, the UE is not expected to be
configured on overlapping symbols with more than one SRS resources
configured by the higher layer parameter *SRS-PosResource* with

than one SRS resources configured by the higher layer parameter
*SRS-PosResource* with *resourceType* of the SRS resources as
\'semi-persistent\' or \'aperiodic\'.

For intra-band and inter-band CA operations, a UE can simultaneously
transmit more than one SRS resource configured by *SRS-PosResource* on
different CCs, subject to UE\'s capability

For intra-band and inter-band CA operations, a UE can simultaneously
transmit more than one SRS resource configured by *SRS-PosResource* and
*SRS-Resource* on different CCs, subject to UE\'s capability.

The SRS request field \[5, TS38.212\] in DCI format 0\_1, 1\_1, 0\_2 (if
SRS request field is present), 1\_2 (if SRS request field is present)
indicates the triggered SRS resource set given in Table 7.3.1.1.2-24 of
\[5, TS 38.212\]. The 2-bit SRS request field \[5, TS38.212\] in DCI
format 2\_3 indicates the triggered SRS resource set given in Clause 7.3
of \[5, TS 38.212\] and defined by the entries of the higher layer
parameter *srs-ResourceSetToAddModList* if the UE is configured with
higher layer parameter *srs-TPC-PDCCH-Group* set to \'typeB\', or
indicates the SRS transmission on a set of serving cells configured by
higher layers if the UE is configured with higher layer parameter
*srs-TPC-PDCCH-Group* set to \'typeA\'.

For PUCCH and SRS on the same carrier, a UE shall not transmit SRS when
semi-persistent or periodic SRS is configured in the same symbol(s) with
PUCCH carrying only CSI report(s), or only L1-RSRP report(s), or only
L1-SINR report(s). A UE shall not transmit SRS when semi-persistent or
periodic SRS is configured or aperiodic SRS is triggered to be
transmitted in the same symbol(s) with PUCCH carrying HARQ-ACK, link
recovery request (as defined in clause 9.2.4 of \[6, 38.213\]) and/or
SR. In the case that SRS is not transmitted due to overlap with PUCCH,
only the SRS symbol(s) that overlap with PUCCH symbol(s) are dropped.
PUCCH shall not be transmitted when aperiodic SRS is triggered to be
transmitted to overlap in the same symbol with PUCCH carrying
semi-persistent/periodic CSI report(s) or semi-persistent/periodic
L1-RSRP report(s) only, or only L1-SINR report(s).

In case of intra-band carrier aggregation or in inter-band CA band
combination if simultaneous SRS and PUCCH/PUSCH transmissions are not
supported by UE, the UE is not expected to be indicated with a SRS
transmission from a carrier and to be configured or scheduled with a
PUSCH/UL DM-RS/UL PT-RS/PUCCH transmission from a different carrier in
the same symbol.

In case of intra-band carrier aggregation or in inter-band CA band
combination if simultaneous SRS and PRACH/MsgA PUSCH transmissions are
not supported by UE, the UE shall not transmit simultaneously SRS
resource(s) from a carrier and PRACH/MsgA PUSCH from a different
carrier.

In case a SRS resource with *resourceType* set as \'aperiodic\' is
triggered on the OFDM symbol(s) configured with periodic/semi-persistent
SRS transmission, the UE shall transmit the aperiodic SRS resource and
only the periodic/semi-persistent SRS symbol(s) overlapping within the
symbol(s) are dropped, while the periodic/semi-persistent SRS symbol(s)
that are not overlapped with the aperiodic SRS resource are transmitted.
In case a SRS resource with *resourceType* set as \'semi-persistent\' is
triggered on the OFDM symbol(s) configured with periodic SRS
transmission, the UE shall transmit the semi-persistent SRS resource and
only the periodic SRS symbol(s) overlapping within the symbol(s) are
dropped, while the periodic SRS symbol(s) that are not overlapped with
the semi-persistent SRS resource are transmitted.

When the UE is configured with the higher layer parameter *usage* in
*SRS-ResourceSet* set to \'antennaSwitching\', and a guard period of Y
symbols is configured according to Clause 6.2.1.2, the UE shall use the
same priority rules as defined above during the guard period as if SRS
was configured.

When a *spatialRelationInfo* is activated/updated for a semi-persistent
or aperiodic SRS resource configured by the higher layer parameter
*SRS-Resource* by a MAC CE for a set of CCs/BWPs, where the applicable
list of CCs provided by higher layer parameter
*simultaneousSpatial-UpdatedList1* or *simultaneousSpatial-UpdatedList2*
is determined by the indicated CC in the MAC CE, the
*spatialRelationInfo* is applied for the semi-persistent or aperiodic
SRS resource(s) with the same SRS resource ID for all the BWPs in the
determined CCs.

When the higher layer parameter *enableDefaultBeamPL-ForSRS* is set
\'enabled\', and if the higher layer parameter *spatialRelationInfo* for
the SRS resource, except for the SRS resource with the higher layer
parameter *usage* in SRS-ResourceSet set to \'beamManagement\' or for
the SRS resource with the higher layer parameter *usage* in
SRS-ResourceSet set to \'nonCodebook\' with configuration of
*associatedCSI-RS* or for the SRS resource configured by the higher
layer parameter *SRS-PosResourceSet*, is not configured in FR2 and if
the UE is not configured with higher layer parameter(s)
*pathlossReferenceRS*, and if the UE is not configured with different
values of *coresetPoolIndex* in *ControlResourceSets*, and is not
provided at least one TCI codepoint mapped with two TCI states, the UE
shall transmit the target SRS resource in an active UL BWP of a CC,

\- according to the spatial relation, if applicable, with a reference to
the RS configured with *qcl-Type* set to \'typeD\' corresponding to the
QCL assumption of the CORESET with the lowest *controlResourceSetId* in
the active DL BWP in the CC.

\- according to the spatial relation, if applicable, with a reference to
the RS configured with *qcl-Type* set to \'typeD\' in the activated TCI
state with the lowest ID applicable to PDSCH in the active DL BWP of the
CC if the UE is not configured with any CORESET in the active DL BWP of
the CC

#### 6.2.1.1 UE SRS frequency hopping procedure

For a given SRS resource, the UE is configured with repetition factor
R∈{1,2,4} by higher layer parameter *resourceMapping* in *SRS-Resource*
where *R*≤*N~s~*. When frequency hopping within an SRS resource in each
slot is not configured (*R=N~s~*), each of the antenna ports of the SRS
resource in each slot is mapped in all the symbols to the same set of
subcarriers in the same set of PRBs. When frequency hopping within an
SRS resource in each slot is configured without repetition (*R=1*),
according to the SRS hopping parameters , and defined in Clause 6.4.1.4
of \[4, TS 38.211\], each of the antenna ports of the SRS resource in
each slot is mapped to different sets of subcarriers in each OFDM
symbol, where the same transmission comb value is assumed for different
sets of subcarriers. When both frequency hopping and repetition within
an SRS resource in each slot are configured (*N~s~=4, R=2*), each of the
antenna ports of the SRS resource in each slot is mapped to the same set
of subcarriers within each pair of R adjacent OFDM symbols, and
frequency hopping across the two pairs is according to the SRS hopping
parameters , and .

For operation with shared spectrum channel access, the UE does not
expect that multiple hops of an SRS resource transmission are in
different RB sets.

A UE may be configured adjacent symbol aperiodic SRS resource with
intra-slot frequency hopping within a bandwidth part, where the full
hopping bandwidth is sounded with an equal-size subband across symbols
when frequency hopping is configured with *R=1*. A UE may be configured
adjacent symbols aperiodic SRS resource with intra-slot frequency
hopping within a bandwidth part, where the full hopping bandwidth is
sounded with an equal-size subband across two pairs of *R* adjacent OFDM
symbols, when frequency hopping is configured with *R=2*. Each of the
antenna ports of the SRS resource is mapped to the same set of
subcarriers within each pair of R adjacent OFDM symbols of the resource.

A UE may be configured symbol periodic or semi-persistent SRS resource
with inter-slot hopping within a bandwidth part, where the SRS resource
occupies the same symbol location in each slot. A UE may be configured
symbol periodic or semi-persistent SRS resource with intra-slot and
inter-slot hopping within a bandwidth part, where the SRS resource
occupies the same symbol location(s) in each slot. For *N~s~=4*, when
frequency hopping is configured with *R=2*, intra-slot and inter-slot
hopping is supported with each of the antenna ports of the SRS resource
mapped to different sets of subcarriers across two pairs of *R* adjacent
OFDM symbol(s) of the resource in each slot. Each of the antenna ports
of the SRS resource is mapped to the same set of subcarriers within each
pair of *R* adjacent OFDM symbols of the resource in each slot. For
*N~s~= R*, when frequency hopping is configured, inter-slot frequency
hopping is supported with each of the antenna ports of the SRS resource
mapped to the same set of subcarriers in *R* adjacent OFDM symbol(s) of
the resource in each slot.

#### 6.2.1.2 UE sounding procedure for DL CSI acquisition

When the UE is configured with the higher layer parameter *usage* in
*SRS-ResourceSet* set as \'antennaSwitching\', the UE may be configured
with only one of the following configurations depending on the indicated
UE capability *supportedSRS-TxPortSwitch* (\'t1r2\' for 1T2R,
*\'t1r1-t1r2\' for 1T=1R/1T2R,* \'t2r4\' for 2T4R, \'t1r4\' for 1T4R,
*\'t1r1-t1r2-t1r4\' for 1T=1R/1T2R/1T4R,* \'t1r4-t2r4\' for 1T4R/2T4R,

*- For 1T2R, up to two SRS resource sets configured with a different
value for the higher layer parameter resourceType in SRS-ResourceSet
set, where each set has* two SRS resources transmitted in different
symbols, each SRS resource in a given set consisting of a single SRS
port, and the SRS port of the second resource in the set is associated
with a different UE antenna port than the SRS port of the first resource
in the same set, or

*- For 2T4R, up to two SRS resource sets configured with a different
value for the higher layer parameter resourceType in SRS-ResourceSet
set, where each SRS resource set has* two SRS resources transmitted in
different symbols, each SRS resource in a given set consisting of two
SRS ports, and the SRS port pair of the second resource is associated
with a different UE antenna port pair than the SRS port pair of the
first resource, or

*- For 1T4R, zero or one SRS resource set configured with higher layer
parameter resourceType in SRS-ResourceSet set to \'periodic\' or
\'semi-persistent\' with four SRS resources transmitted in different
symbols, each SRS resource in a given set consisting of a single SRS
port, and the SRS port of each resource is associated with a different
UE antenna port, and*

*- For 1T4R, zero or two SRS resource sets each configured with higher
layer parameter resourceType in SRS-ResourceSet set to \'aperiodic\' and
with a total of four SRS resources transmitted in different symbols of
two different slots, and where the SRS port of each SRS resource in the
given two sets is associated with a different UE antenna port. The two
sets are each configured with two SRS resources, or one set is
configured with one SRS resource and the other set is configured with
three SRS resources. The UE shall expect that the two sets are both
configured with the same values of the higher layer parameters alpha,
p0, pathlossReferenceRS, and srs-PowerControlAdjustmentStates in
SRS-ResourceSet. The UE shall expect that the value of the higher layer
parameter* *aperiodicSRS-ResourceTrigger* or the value of an entry in
*AperiodicSRS-ResourceTriggerList* *in each SRS-ResourceSet is the same,
and the value of the higher layer parameter slotOffset in each
SRS-ResourceSet is different. Or,*

*- For 1T=1R, or 2T=2R, or 4T=4R, up to two SRS resource sets each with
one SRS resource, where the number of SRS ports for each resource is
equal to 1, 2, or 4.*

The UE is configured with a guard period of Y symbols, in which the UE
does not transmit any other signal, in the case the SRS resources of a
set are transmitted in the same slot. The guard period is in-between the
SRS resources of the set.

The UE shall expect to be configured with the same number of SRS ports
for all SRS resources in the SRS resource set(s) with higher layer
parameter *usage* set as \'antennaSwitching\'.

For 1T2R, 1T4R or 2T4R, the UE shall not expect to be configured or
triggered with more than one SRS resource set with higher layer
parameter *usage* set as \'antennaSwitching\' in the same slot. For
1T=1R, 2T=2R or 4T=4R, the UE shall not expect to be configured or
triggered with more than one SRS resource set with higher layer
parameter *usage* set as \'antennaSwitching\' in the same symbol.

The value of *Y* is defined by Table 6.2.1.2-1.

#### 6.2.1.3 UE sounding procedure between component carriers

A UE can be configured with SRS resource(s) on a carrier *c~1~* with
slot formats comprised of DL and UL symbols and not configured for
PUSCH/PUCCH transmission. For carrier *c~1~*, the UE is configured with
higher layer parameter *srs-SwitchFromServCellIndex* and
*srs-SwitchFromCarrier* the switching from carrier *c~2~* which is
configured for PUSCH/PUCCH transmission. During SRS transmission on
carrier *c~1\ ~*(including any interruption due to uplink or downlink RF
retuning time \[11, TS 38.133\] as defined by higher layer parameters
*switchingTimeUL* and *switchingTimeDL* of *SRS-SwitchingTimeNR*), the
UE temporarily suspends the uplink transmission on carrier *c~2~*.

For an SRS transmission starting in symbol $N_{c_{1}}$ of carrier
$c_{1}$ and a conflicting transmission in carrier $c_{2}$ starting in
symbol$\ N_{c_{2}}$, the UE shall apply the prioritization / dropping
rules in the remainder of this clause taking into account:

\- DCI(s) for which the time interval between the last symbol of PDCCH
and $N_{c_{1}}$ is at least$\text{\ N}_{2}\ $*symbols and an additional
time duration* $T_{\text{SR}S_{\text{CS}}}$*, and the time interval
between the last symbol of PDCCH and* $N_{c_{2}}$ is at least
$\text{\ N}_{2}$ *symbols; and*

\- semi-persistent CSI reports or SRS considered *active at least*
$N_{2}$ *symbols and an additional time duration*
$T_{\text{SR}S_{\text{CS}}}$ *before* $N_{c_{1}}$*, and considered
active at least* $N_{2}$ *symbols before* $N_{c_{2}}$*.*

*where*
$T_{\text{SR}S_{\text{CS}}} = max\{ switchingTimeUL,switchingTimeDL\}$*,
and t*he time interval unit of OFDM symbol is counted based on the
smaller subcarrier spacing across $c_{1},\ c_{2}$ and their
corresponding scheduling cells.

For a carrier of a serving cell with slot formats comprised of DL and UL
symbols, not configured for PUSCH/PUCCH transmission, the UE shall not
transmit SRS whenever SRS transmission (including any interruption due
to uplink or downlink RF retuning time \[11, TS 38.133\] as defined by
higher layer parameters *switchingTimeUL* and *switchingTimeDL* of
*SRS-SwitchingTimeNR)* on the carrier of the serving cell and
PUSCH/PUCCH transmission carrying HARQ-ACK/positive SR/RI/CRI/SSBRI
and/or PRACH happen to overlap in the same symbol [ ]{.underline} and
that can result in uplink transmissions beyond the UE\'s indicated
uplink carrier aggregation capability included in \[13, TS 38.306\].

For a carrier of a serving cell with slot formats comprised of DL and UL
symbols, not configured for PUSCH/PUCCH transmission, the UE shall not
transmit a periodic/semi-persistent SRS whenever
periodic/semi-persistent SRS transmission (including any interruption
due to uplink or downlink RF retuning time \[11, TS 38.133\] as defined
by higher layer parameters *switchingTimeUL* and *switchingTimeDL* of
*SRS-SwitchingTimeNR)* on the carrier of the serving cell and PUSCH
transmission carrying aperiodic CSI happen to overlap in the same symbol
and that can result in uplink transmissions beyond the UE\'s indicated
uplink carrier aggregation capability included in \[13, TS 38.306\].

For a carrier of a serving cell with slot formats comprised of DL and UL
symbols, not configured for PUSCH/PUCCH transmission, the UE shall drop
PUCCH/PUSCH transmission carrying periodic/semi-persistent CSI
comprising only CQI/PMI/L1-RSRP/L1-SINR, and/or SRS transmission on
another serving cell configured for PUSCH/PUCCH transmission whenever
the transmission and SRS transmission (including any interruption due to
uplink or downlink RF retuning time \[11, TS 38.133\] as defined by
higher layer parameters *switchingTimeUL* and *switchingTimeDL* of
*SRS-SwitchingTimeNR)* on the serving cell happen to overlap in the same
symbol and that can result in uplink transmissions beyond the UE\'s
indicated uplink carrier aggregation capability included in \[13, TS
38.306\].

For a carrier of a serving cell with slot formats comprised of DL and UL
symbols, not configured for PUSCH/PUCCH transmission, the UE shall drop
PUSCH transmission carrying aperiodic CSI comprising only
CQI/PMI/L1-RSRP/L1-SINR whenever the transmission and aperiodic SRS
transmission (including any interruption due to uplink or downlink RF
retuning time \[11, TS 38.133\]) as defined by higher layer parameters
*switchingTimeUL* and *switchingTimeDL* of *SRS-SwitchingTimeNR)* on the
carrier of the serving cell happen to overlap in the same symbol and
that can result in uplink transmissions beyond the UE\'s indicated
uplink carrier aggregation capability included in \[13, TS 38.306\].

For an aperiodic SRS triggered in DCI format 2\_3 and if the UE is
configured with higher layer parameter *srs-TPC-PDCCH-Group* set to
\'typeA\', and given by *SRS-CarrierSwitching,* without PUSCH/PUCCH
transmission, the order of the triggered SRS transmission on the serving
cells follow the order of the serving cells in the indicated set of
serving cells configured by higher layers, where the UE in each serving
cell transmits the configured one or two SRS resource set(s) from
*srs-ResourceSetToAddModList* with higher layer parameter *usage* set to
\'antennaSwitching\' and higher layer parameter *resourceType* in
*SRS-ResourceSet* set to \'aperiodic\'.

For an aperiodic SRS triggered in DCI format 2\_3 and if the UE is
configured with higher layer parameter *srs-TPC-PDCCH-Group* set to
\'typeB\' without PUSCH/PUCCH transmission, the order of the triggered
SRS transmission on the serving cells follow the order of the serving
cells with aperiodic SRS triggered in the DCI, and the UE in each
serving cell transmits the configured one or two SRS resource set(s)
from *srs-ResourceSetToAddModList* with higher layer parameter *usage*
set to \'antennaSwitching\' and higher layer parameter *resourceType* in
*SRS-ResourceSet* set to \'aperiodic\'.

If the UE is not configured for PUSCH/PUCCH transmission on carrier
*c~1\ ~*with slot formats comprised of DL and UL symbols, and if the UE
is not capable of simultaneous reception and transmission on carrier
*c~1~* and serving cell *c~2~*, the UE is not expected to be configured
or indicated with SRS resource(s) such that SRS transmission on carrier
*c~1~* (including any interruption due to uplink or downlink RF retuning
time \[11, TS 38.133\] as defined by higher layer parameters
*switchingTimeUL* and *switchingTimeDL* of *SRS-SwitchingTimeNR*) would
collide with the REs corresponding to the SS/PBCH blocks configured for
the UE or the slots belonging to a control resource set indicated by
*MIB* or *SIB1* on serving cell *c~2~*.

For *n*-th (*n ≥* 1) aperiodic SRS transmission on a cell *c*, upon
detection of a positive SRS request on a grant, the UE shall commence
this SRS transmission on the configured symbol and slot provided

\- it is no earlier than the summation of

\- the maximum time duration between the two durations spanned by N OFDM
symbols of the numerology of cell *c* and the cell carrying the grant
respectively, and

\- the UL or DL RF retuning time \[11, TS 38.133\] as defined by higher
layer parameters *switchingTimeUL* and *switchingTimeDL* of
*SRS-SwitchingTimeNR,*

\- it does not collide with any previous SRS transmissions, or
interruption due to UL or DL RF retuning time.

otherwise, *n*-th SRS transmission is dropped, where N is the reported
capability as the minimum time interval in unit of symbols, between the
DCI triggering and aperiodic SRS transmission.

In case of inter-band carrier aggregation, a UE can simultaneously
transmit SRS and PUCCH/PUSCH across component carriers in different
bands subject to the UE\'s capability.

In case of inter-band carrier aggregation, a UE can simultaneously
transmit PRACH and SRS across component carriers in different bands
subject to UE\'s capability.

#### 6.2.1.4 UE sounding procedure for positioning purposes

When the SRS is configured by the higher layer parameter
*SRS-PosResource* and if the higher layer parameter
*spatialRelationInfoPos* is configured*,* it contains the ID of the
configuration fields of a reference RS according to Clause 6.3.2 of \[TS
38.331\]. The reference RS can be an SRS configured by the higher layer
parameter *SRS-Resource* or *SRS-PosResource*, CSI-RS, SS/PBCH block, or
a DL PRS configured on a serving cell or a SS/PBCH block or a DL PRS
configured on a non-serving cell.

The UE is not expected to transmit multiple SRS resources with different
spatial relations in the same OFDM symbol.

If the UE is not configured with the higher layer parameter
*spatialRelationInfoPos* the UE may use a fixed spatial domain
transmission filter for transmissions of the SRS configured by the
higher layer parameter *SRS-PosResource* across multiple SRS resources
or it may use a different spatial domain transmission filter across
multiple SRS resources.

The UE is only expected to transmit an SRS configured by the higher
layer parameter *SRS-PosResource* within the active UL BWP of the UE.

When the configuration of SRS is done by the higher layer parameter
*SRS-PosResource*, the UE can only be provided with a single RS source
in *spatialRelationInfoPos* per SRS resource for positioning.

For operation on the same carrier, if an SRS configured by the higher
parameter *SRS-PosResource* collides with a scheduled PUSCH, the SRS is
dropped in the symbols where the collision occurs.

The UE does not expect to be configured with *SRS-PosResource* on a
carrier of a serving cell with slot formats comprised of DL and UL
symbols, not configured for PUSCH/PUCCH transmission.

### 6.2.2 UE DM-RS transmission procedure

The DM-RS transmission procedures for PUSCH scheduled by PDCCH with DCI
format 0\_1 described in this clause equally apply to PUSCH scheduled by
PDCCH with DCI format 0\_2, by applying the parameters of
*dmrs-UplinkForPUSCH-MappingTypeA-DCI-0-2* and
*dmrs-UplinkForPUSCH-MappingTypeB-DCI-0-2* instead of
*dmrs-UplinkForPUSCH-MappingTypeA* and
*dmrs-UplinkForPUSCH-MappingTypeB*.

When transmitted PUSCH is neither scheduled by DCI format 0\_1/0\_2 with
CRC scrambled by C-RNTI, CS-RNTI, SP-CSI-RNTI or MCS-C-RNTI, nor
corresponding to a configured grant, nor being a PUSCH for Type-2 random
access procedure, the UE shall use single symbol front-loaded DM-RS of
configuration type 1 on DM-RS port 0 and the remaining REs not used for
DM-RS in the symbols are not used for any PUSCH transmission except for
PUSCH with allocation duration of 2 or less OFDM symbols with transform
precoding disabled, additional DM-RS can be transmitted according to the
scheduling type and the PUSCH duration as specified in Table 6.4.1.1.3-3
of \[4, TS38.211\] for frequency hopping disabled and as specified in
Table 6.4.1.1.3-6 of \[4, TS38.211\] for frequency hopping enabled, and

If frequency hopping is disabled:

\- The UE shall assume *dmrs-AdditionalPosition* equals to \'pos2\' and
up to two additional DM-RS can be transmitted according to PUSCH
duration, or

If frequency hopping is enabled:

\- The UE shall assume *dmrs-AdditionalPosition* equals to \'pos1\' and
up to one additional DM-RS can be transmitted according to PUSCH
duration.

When transmitted PUSCH is scheduled by activation DCI format 0\_0 with
CRC scrambled by CS-RNTI, the UE shall use single symbol front-loaded
DM-RS of configuration type provided by higher layer parameter
*dmrs-Type* in *DMRS-UplinkConfig* on DM-RS port 0 and the remaining REs
not used for DM-RS in the symbols are not used for any PUSCH
transmission except for PUSCH with allocation duration of 2 or less OFDM
symbols with transform precoding disabled, and additional DM-RS with
*dmrs-AdditionalPosition* from C*onfiguredGrantConfig* can be
transmitted according to the scheduling type and the PUSCH duration as
specified in Table 6.4.1.1.3-3 of \[4, TS38.211\] for frequency hopping
disabled and as specified in Table 6.4.1.1.3-6 of \[4, TS38.211\] for
frequency hopping enabled.

For the UE-specific reference signals generation as defined in Clause
6.4.1.1 of \[4, TS 38.211\], a UE can be configured by higher layers
with one or two scrambling identity(s), $n_{\text{ID}}^{DMRS,i}\ $*i* =
0,1 which are the same for both PUSCH mapping Type A and Type B.

When transmitted PUSCH is scheduled by DCI format 0\_1 with CRC
scrambled by C-RNTI, CS-RNTI, SP-CSI-RNTI or MCS-C-RNTI, or
corresponding to a configured grant, or being a PUSCH for Type-2 random
access procedure,

\- the UE may be configured with higher layer parameter *dmrs-Type* in
*DMRS-UplinkConfig*, and the configured DM-RS configuration type is used
for transmitting PUSCH in as defined in Clause 6.4.1.1 of \[4, TS
38.211\].

\- the UE may be configured with the maximum number of front-loaded
DM-RS symbols for PUSCH by higher layer parameter *maxLength* in
*DMRS-UplinkConfig,* or by higher layer parameter *msgA-MaxLength* in
*msgA-DMRS-Config*,

\- if *maxLength* is not configured, single-symbol DM-RS can be
scheduled for the UE by DCI or configured by the configured grant
configuration, and the UE can be configured with a number of additional
DM-RS for PUSCH by higher layer parameter *dmrs-AdditionalPosition,*
which can be \'pos0\', \'pos1\', \'pos2\', \'pos3\'.

\- if *maxLength* is configured, either single-symbol DM-RS or double
symbol DM-RS can be scheduled for the UE by DCI or configured by the
configured grant configuration, and the UE can be configured with a
number of additional DM-RS for PUSCH by higher layer parameter
*dmrs-AdditionalPosition,* which can be \'pos0\' or \'pos1\'.

\- for MsgA PUSCH for Type-2 random access procedure the UE can be
configured with a number of additional DM-RS for PUSCH by higher layer
parameter *msgA-DMRS-AdditionalPosition,* which can be \'pos0\',
\'pos1\', \'pos2\', \'pos3\' for single-symbol DM-RS or \'pos0\',
\'pos1\' for double-symbol DM-RS.

\- and, the UE shall transmit a number of additional DM-RS as specified
in Table 6.4.1.1.3-3 and Table 6.4.1.1.3-4 in -Clause 6.4.1.1.3 of \[4,
TS 38.211\].

If a UE transmitting PUSCH scheduled by DCI format 0\_2 is configured
with the higher layer parameter *phaseTrackingRS* in
*dmrs-UplinkForPUSCH-MappingTypeA-DCI-0-2* or
*dmrs-UplinkForPUSCH-MappingTypeB-DCI-0-2*, or a UE transmitting PUSCH
scheduled by DCI format 0\_0 or DCI format 0\_1 is configured with the
higher layer parameter *phaseTrackingRS* in
*dmrs-UplinkForPUSCH-MappingTypeA* or
*dmrs-UplinkForPUSCH-MappingTypeB*, the UE may assume that the following
configurations are not occurring simultaneously for the transmitted
PUSCH

\- any DM-RS ports among 4-7 or 6-11 for DM-RS configurations type 1 and
type 2, respectively are scheduled for the UE and PT-RS is transmitted
from the UE.

For PUSCH scheduled by DCI format 0\_1, by activation DCI format 0\_1
with CRC scrambled by CS-RNTI, or configured by configured grant Type 1
configuration, the UE shall assume the DM-RS CDM groups indicated in
Tables 7.3.1.1.2-6 to 7.3.1.1.2-23 of Clause 7.3.1.1 of \[5, TS38.212\]
are not used for data transmission, where \"1\", \"2\" and \"3\" for the
number of DM-RS CDM group(s) correspond to CDM group 0, {0,1}, {0,1,2},
respectively.

For PUSCH scheduled by DCI format 0\_0 or by activation DCI format 0\_0
with CRC scrambled by CS-RNTI, the UE shall assume the number of DM-RS
CDM groups without data is 1 which corresponds to CDM group 0 for the
case of PUSCH with allocation duration of 2 or less OFDM symbols with
transform precoding disabled, the UE shall assume that the number of
DM-RS CDM groups without data is 3 which corresponds to CDM group
{0,1,2} for the case of PUSCH scheduled by activation DCI format 0\_0
and the *dmrs-Type* in *DMRS-UplinkConfig* equal to \'type2\' and the
PUSCH allocation duration being more than 2 OFDM symbols, and the UE
shall assume that the number of DM-RS CDM groups without data is 2 which
corresponds to CDM group {0,1} for all other cases.

For MsgA PUSCH transmission, if the UE is not configured with
*msgA-PUSCH-DMRS-CDM-group, the UE* shall assume that 2 DM-RS CDM groups
are configured. Otherwise, *msgA-PUSCH-DMRS-CDM-group indicates which
DM-RS CDM group to use from the set of {0,1}.*

For MsgA PUSCH transmission, if the UE is not configured with
*msgA-PUSCH-NrofPorts, the UE* shall assume that 4 ports are configured
per DM-RS CDM group for double-symbol DM-RS. Otherwise,
*msgA-PUSCH-NrofPorts with value of 0 indicates the first port per DM-RS
CDM group, while a value of 1 indicates the first two ports per DM-RS
CDM group*.

For uplink DM-RS with PUSCH, the UE may assume the ratio of PUSCH EPRE
to DM-RS EPRE ( \[dB\]) is given by Table 6.2.2-1 according to the
number of DM-RS CDM groups without data. The DM-RS scaling factor
specified in clause 6.4.1.1.3 of \[4, TS 38.211\] is given by .

Table 6.2.2-1: The ratio of PUSCH EPRE to DM-RS EPRE

  Number of DM-RS CDM groups without data   DM-RS configuration type 1   DM-RS configuration type 2
  ----------------------------------------- ---------------------------- ----------------------------
  1                                         0 dB                         0 dB
  2                                         -3 dB                        -3 dB
  3                                         \-                           -4.77 dB

For PUSCH repetition Type B, the DM-RS transmission procedure is applied
for each actual repetition separately based on the allocation duration
of the actual repetition. A UE is not expected to be indicated with an
antenna port configuration that is invalid for the allocated duration of
any actual repetition.

### 6.2.3 UE PT-RS transmission procedure

The procedures on PT-RS transmission described in this clause as well as
clauses 6.2.3.1 and 6.2.3.2 apply to a UE PUSCH transmission scheduled
by DCI format 0\_2 if the higher layer parameter *phaseTrackingRS* in
*dmrs-UplinkForPUSCH-MappingTypeA-DCI-0-2 or
dmrs-UplinkForPUSCH-MappingTypeB-DCI-0-2* is configured, to PUSCH
transmissions scheduled by DCI format 0\_0 or format 0\_1 if the higher
layer parameter *phaseTrackingRS* in *dmrs-UplinkForPUSCH-MappingTypeA
or dmrs-UplinkForPUSCH-MappingTypeB* is configured and PUSCH
transmissions corresponding to a configured grant if the higher layer
parameter *phaseTrackingRS* in *cg-DMRS-Configuration* is configured. If
a UE is not configured with the higher layer parameter *phaseTrackingRS*
in the respective *DMRS-UplinkConfig*, the UE shall not transmit PT-RS.
The PT-RS is only present on PUSCH scheduled by PDCCH with CRC scrambled
by MCS-C-RNTI, C-RNTI, CS-RNTI, SP-CSI-RNTI and on PUSCH corresponding
to a configured grant. For PUSCH repetition Type B, the PT-RS
transmission procedure is applied for each actual repetition separately
based on the allocation duration of the actual repetition.

#### 6.2.3.1 UE PT-RS transmission procedure when transform precoding is not enabled

When transform precoding is not enabled and if a UE is configured with
the higher layer parameter *phaseTrackingRS* in *DMRS-UplinkConfig,*

\- the higher layer parameters *timeDensity* and *frequencyDensity* in
*PTRS-UplinkConfig* indicate the threshold values *ptrs-MCS~i~*,
*i*=1,2,3 and *N~RB,i~* , *i*=0,1, as shown in Table 6.2.3.1-1 and Table
6.2.3.1-2, respectively.

\- if either or both higher layer parameters *timeDensity* and/or
*frequencyDensity* in *PTRS-UplinkConfig* are configured, the UE shall
assume the PT-RS antenna ports\' presence and pattern are a function of
the corresponding scheduled MCS and scheduled bandwidth in a
corresponding bandwidth part as shown in Table 6.2.3.1-1 and Table
6.2.3.1-2, respectively,

\- if the higher layer parameter *timeDensity* is not configured, the UE
shall assume *L~PT-RS\ ~*= 1.

\- if the higher layer parameter *frequencyDensity* is not configured,
the UE shall assume *K~PT-RS~* = 2.

\- if none of the higher layer parameters *timeDensity* and
*frequencyDensity* in *PTRS-UplinkConfig* are configured, the UE shall
assume *L~PT-RS~* = 1 and *K~PT-RS~* = 2.

Table 6.2.3.1-1: Time density of PT-RS as a function of scheduled MCS

  Scheduled MCS                   Time density()
  ------------------------------- ----------------------
  I~MCS~ \< ptrs-MCS~1~           PT-RS is not present
  ptrs-MCS1 I~MCS~ \< ptrs-MCS2   4
  ptrs-MCS2 I~MCS~ \< ptrs-MCS3   2
  ptrs-MCS3 I~MCS~ \< ptrs-MCS4   1

Table 6.2.3.1-2: Frequency density of PT-RS as a function of scheduled
bandwidth

  Scheduled bandwidth      Frequency density ()
  ------------------------ ----------------------
  N~RB~ \< N~RB0~          PT-RS is not present
  N~RB0~ N~RB~ \< N~RB1~   2
  N~RB1~ N~RB~             4

The higher layer parameter *PTRS-UplinkConfig* provides the parameters
*ptrs-MCS~i~*, *i=1,2,3* and with values in 0-29 when MCS Table
5.1.3.1-1 or Table 5.1.3.1-3 is used and 0-28 when MCS Table 5.1.3.1-2
is used, respectively. *ptrs-MCS4* is not explicitly configured by
higher layers but assumed 29 when MCS Table 5.1.3.1-1 or Table 5.1.3.1-3
is used and 28 when MCS Table 5.1.3.1-2 is used. The higher layer
parameter *PTRS-UplinkConfig* provides the parameters *N~RBi~* *i=0,1*
with values in range 1-276.

If the higher layer parameter *PTRS-UplinkConfig* indicates that the
time density thresholds *ptrs-MCS~i~* = *ptrs-MCS~i+1~*, then the time
density *L~PTRS~* of the associated row where both these thresholds
appear in Table 6.2.3.1-1 is disabled. If the higher layer parameter
*frequencyDensity* in *PTRS-UplinkConfig* indicates that the frequency
density thresholds *N~RB,i~* = *N~RB,i+1~*, then the frequency density
*K~PTRS~* of the associated row where both these thresholds appear in
Table 6.2.3.1-2 is disabled.

If either or both of the parameters PT-RS time density (*L~PT-RS~*) and
PT-RS frequency density (*K~PT-RS~*), shown in Table 6.2.3.1-1 and Table
6.2.3.1-2, indicates that are configured as \'PT-RS not present\', the
UE shall assume that PT-RS is not present.

When a UE is scheduled to transmit PUSCH with allocation duration of 2
symbols or less, and if *L~PT-RS~* is set to 2 or 4, the UE shall not
transmit PT-RS. When a UE is scheduled to transmit PUSCH with allocation
duration of 4 symbols or less, and if *L~PT-RS~* is set to 4, the UE
shall not transmit PT-RS.

When a UE is scheduled to transmit PUSCH for retransmission, if the UE
is scheduled with *I~MCS~* \> *V*, where *V* = 28 for MCS Table
5.1.3.1-1 and MCS Table 5.1.3.1-3 and *V* = 27 for MCS Table 5.1.3.1-2,
respectively, the MCS for PT-RS time-density determination is obtained
from the DCI for the same transport block in the initial transmission,
which is smaller than or equal to V.

The maximum number of configured PT-RS ports is given by the higher
layer parameter *maxNrofPorts* in *PTRS-UplinkConfig.* The UE is not
expected to be configured with a larger number of UL PT-RS ports than it
has reported need for.

If a UE has reported the capability of supporting full-coherent UL
transmission, the UE shall expect the number of UL PT-RS ports to be
configured as one if UL-PTRS is configured.

For codebook or non-codebook based UL transmission, the association
between UL PT-RS port(s) and DM-RS port(s) is signalled by *PTRS-DMRS
association* field in DCI format 0\_1 and DCI format 0\_2. For a PUSCH
corresponding to a configured grant Type 1 transmission, the UE may
assume the association between UL PT-RS port(s) and DM-RS port(s)
defined by value 0 in Table 7.3.1.1.2-25 or value \"00\" in Table
7.3.1.1.1.2-26 described in Clause 7.3.1 of \[5, TS38.212\].

For PUSCH scheduled by DCI format 0\_0 or by activation DCI format 0\_0,
the UL PT-RS port is associated to DM-RS port 0.

For non-codebook based UL transmission, the actual number of UL PT-RS
port(s) to transmit is determined based on SRI(s) in DCI format 0\_1 and
DCI format 0\_2 or higher layer parameter *sri-ResourceIndicator* in
*rrc-ConfiguredUplinkGrant*. A UE is configured with the PT-RS port
index for each configured SRS resource by the higher layer parameter
*ptrs-PortIndex* configured by *SRS-Config* if the UE is configured with
the higher layer parameter *phaseTrackingRS in DMRS-UplinkConfig*. If
the PT-RS port index associated with different SRIs are the same, the
corresponding UL DM-RS ports are associated to the one UL PT-RS port.

For partial-coherent and non-coherent codebook-based UL transmission,
the actual number of UL PT-RS port(s) is determined based on TPMI and/or
number of layers which are indicated by \'*Precoding information and
number of layers\'* field in DCI format 0\_1 and DCI format 0\_2 or
configured by higher layer parameter *precodingAndNumberOfLayers*:

\- if the UE is configured with the higher layer parameter
*maxNrofPorts* in *PTRS-UplinkConfig* set to \'n2\', the actual UL PT-RS
port(s) and the associated transmission layer(s) are derived from
indicated TPMI as:

\- PUSCH antenna port 1000 and 1002 in indicated TPMI share PT-RS port
0, and PUSCH antenna port 1001 and 1003 in indicated TPMI share PT-RS
port 1.

> \- UL PT-RS port 0 is associated with the UL layer \'x\' of layers
> which are transmitted with PUSCH antenna port 1000 and PUSCH antenna
> port 1002 in indicated TPMI, and UL PT-RS port 1 is associated with
> the UL layer \'y\' of layers which are transmitted with PUSCH antenna
> port 1001 and PUSCH antenna port 1003 in indicated TPMI, where \'x\'
> and/or \'y\' are given by DCI parameter \'*PTRS-DMRS association\'* as
> shown in DCI format 0\_1 and DCI format 0\_2 described in Clause 7.3.1
> of \[5, TS38.212\].

When the UE is scheduled with *Q~p~*={1,2} PT-RS port(s) in uplink and
the number of scheduled layers is ,

\- If the UE is configured with higher layer parameter *ptrs-Power*, the
PUSCH to PT-RS power ratio per layer per RE is given by , where is shown
in the Table 6.2.3.1-3 according to the higher layer parameter
*ptrs-Power*, the PT-RS scaling factor specified in clause 6.4.1.2.2.1
of \[4, TS 38.211\] is given by and also on the \'*Precoding Information
and Number of Layers\'* field in DCI.

\- The UE shall assume *ptrs-Power* in *PTRS-UplinkConfig* is set to
state \"00\" in Table 6.2.3.1-3 if not configured or in case of
non-codebook based PUSCH.

#### 6.2.3.2 UE PT-RS transmission procedure when transform precoding is enabled

When transform precoding is enabled and if a UE is configured with the
higher layer parameter *transformPrecoderEnabled* in
*PTRS-UplinkConfig,*

\- the UE shall be configured with the higher layer parameters
*sampleDensity* and the UE shall assume the PT-RS antenna ports\'
presence and PT-RS group pattern are a function of the corresponding
scheduled bandwidth in a corresponding bandwidth part, as shown in Table
6.2.3.2-1. The UE shall assume no PT-RS is present when the number of
scheduled RBs is less than N~RB0~ if N~RB0~ \> 1 or if the RNTI equals
TC-RNTI.

\- and the UE may be configured PT-RS time density *L~PT-RS~* = 2 with
the higher layer parameter *timeDensityTransformPrecoding.* Otherwise,
the UE shall assume *L~PT-RS~* = 1.

\- if the higher layer parameter *sampleDensity* indicates that the
sample density thresholds *N~RB,i~* = *N~RB,i+1~*, then the associated
row where both these thresholds appear in Table 6.2.3.2-1 is disabled.

When transform precoding is enabled and if a UE is configured with the
higher layer parameter *transformPrecoderEnabled* in

6.3 UE PUSCH frequency hopping procedure
----------------------------------------

### 6.3.1 Frequency hopping for PUSCH repetition Type A

For PUSCH repetition Type A (as determined according to procedures
defined in Clause 6.1.2.1 for scheduled PUSCH, or Clause 6.1.2.3 for
configured PUSCH), a UE is configured for frequency hopping by the
higher layer parameter *frequencyHoppingDCI-0-2* in *pusch-Config* for
PUSCH transmission scheduled by DCI format 0\_2, and by
*frequencyHopping* provided in *pusch-Config* for PUSCH transmission
scheduled by a DCI format other than 0\_2*,* and by *frequencyHopping*
provided in *configuredGrantConfig* for configured PUSCH transmission.
One of two frequency hopping modes can be configured:

\- Intra-slot frequency hopping, applicable to single slot and
multi-slot PUSCH transmission, each of multiple PUSCH transmissions
scheduled by a DCI if the higher layer parameter
*pusch-TimeDomainAllocationListForMultiPUSCH* is configured and each of
multiple configured grant PUSCH transmissions in a configuration where
the higher layer parameters *cg-nrofSlots* and *cg-nrofPUSCH-InSlot are
provided*.

\- Inter-slot frequency hopping, applicable to multi-slot PUSCH
transmission.

For operation with shared spectrum channel access, the UE does not
expect that two hops of a PUSCH transmission are in different RB sets.

In case of resource allocation type 2, the UE transmits PUSCH without
frequency hopping.

In case of resource allocation type 1, whether or not transform
precoding is enabled for PUSCH transmission, the UE may perform PUSCH
frequency hopping, if the frequency hopping field in a corresponding
detected DCI format or in a random access response UL grant is set to 1,
or if for a Type 1 PUSCH transmission with a configured grant the higher
layer parameter *frequencyHoppingOffset* is provided, otherwise no PUSCH
frequency hopping is performed. When frequency hopping is enabled for
PUSCH, the RE mapping is defined in clause 6.3.1.6 of \[4, TS 38.211\].

For a PUSCH scheduled by RAR UL grant, fallbackRAR UL grant, or by DCI
format 0\_0 with CRC scrambled by TC-RNTI, frequency offsets are
obtained as described in clause 8.3 of \[6, TS 38.213\]. Otherwise, for
a PUSCH scheduled by DCI format 0\_0/0\_1 or a PUSCH based on a Type2
configured UL grant activated by DCI format 0\_0/0\_1 and for resource
allocation type 1, frequency offsets are configured by higher layer
parameter *frequencyHoppingOffsetLists* in *pusch-Config*. For a PUSCH
scheduled by DCI format 0\_2 or a PUSCH based on a Type2 configured UL
grant activated by DCI format 0\_2 and for resource allocation type 1,
frequency offsets are configured by higher layer parameter
*frequencyHoppingOffsetListsDCI-0-2* in *pusch-Config*.

\- When the size of the active BWP is less than 50 PRBs, one of two
higher layer configured offsets is indicated in the UL grant.

\- When the size of the active BWP is equal to or greater than 50 PRBs,
one of four higher layer configured offsets is indicated in the UL
grant.

For PUSCH based on a Type1 configured UL grant the frequency offset is
provided by the higher layer parameter *frequencyHoppingOffset* in
*rrc-ConfiguredUplinkGrant*.

For a MsgA PUSCH the frequency offset is provided by the higher layer
parameter as described in \[6, TS 38.213\].

*In case of intra-slot frequency hopping, t*he starting RB in each hop
is given by:

,

where *i*=0 and *i*=1 are the first hop and the second hop respectively,
and is the starting RB within the UL BWP, as calculated from the
resource block assignment information of resource allocation type 1
(described in Clause 6.1.2.2.2) or as calculated from the resource
assignment for MsgA PUSCH (described in \[6, TS 38.213\]) and is the
frequency offset in RBs between the two frequency hops. *The number of
symbols in the first hop is given by , the number of symbols in the
second hop is given by , where* $N_{\text{symb}}^{PUSCH,s}$ *is the
length of the PUSCH transmission in OFDM symbols in one slot.*

*In case of inter-slot frequency hopping, t*he starting RB during slot
is given by:

,

where is the current slot number within a radio frame, where a
multi-slot PUSCH transmission can take place, is the starting RB within
the UL BWP, as calculated from the resource block assignment information
of resource allocation type 1 (described in Clause 6.1.2.2.2) and is the
frequency offset in RBs between the two frequency hops.

### 6.3.2 Frequency hopping for PUSCH repetition Type B

For PUSCH repetition Type B (as determined according to procedures
defined in Clause 6.1.2.1 for scheduled PUSCH, or Clause 6.1.2.3 for
configured PUSCH), a UE is configured for frequency hopping by the
higher layer parameter *frequencyHoppingDCI-0-2* in *pusch-Config* for
PUSCH transmission scheduled by DCI format 0\_2, by
*frequencyHoppingDCI-0-1* provided in *pusch-Config* for PUSCH
transmission scheduled by DCI format 0\_1, and by
*frequencyHoppingPUSCH-RepTypeB* provided in *rrc-ConfiguredUplinkGrant*
for Type 1 configured PUSCH transmission. The frequency hopping mode for
Type 2 configured PUSCH transmission follows the configuration of the
activating DCI format. One of two frequency hopping modes can be
configured:

\- Inter-repetition frequency hopping

\- Inter-slot frequency hopping

For operation with shared spectrum channel access, the UE does not
expect that two hops of a PUSCH transmission are in different RB sets.

In case of resource allocation type 1, whether or not transform
precoding is enabled for PUSCH transmission, the UE may perform PUSCH
frequency hopping, if the frequency hopping field in a corresponding
detected DCI format is set to 1, or if for a Type 1 PUSCH transmission
with a configured grant the higher layer parameter
*frequencyHoppingPUSCH-RepTypeB* is provided, otherwise no PUSCH
frequency hopping is performed. When frequency hopping is enabled for
PUSCH, the RE mapping is defined in clause 6.3.1.6 of \[4, TS 38.211\].

For a PUSCH scheduled by DCI format 0\_1 or a PUSCH based on a Type 2
configured UL grant activated by DCI format 0\_1 and for resource
allocation type 1, frequency offsets are configured by higher layer
parameter *frequencyHoppingOffsetLists* in *pusch-Config*. For a PUSCH
scheduled by DCI format 0\_2 or a PUSCH based on a Type 2 configured UL
grant activated by DCI format 0\_2 and for resource allocation type 1,
frequency offsets are configured by higher layer parameter
*frequencyHoppingOffsetListsDCI-0-2* in *pusch-Config*.

\- When the size of the active BWP is less than 50 PRBs, one of two
higher layer configured offsets is indicated in the UL grant.

\- When the size of the active BWP is equal to or greater than 50 PRBs,
one of four higher layer configured offsets is indicated in the UL
grant.

For PUSCH based on a Type1 configured UL grant the frequency offset is
provided by the higher layer parameter *frequencyHoppingOffset* in
*rrc-ConfiguredUplinkGrant*.

In case of inter-repetition frequency hopping, the starting RB for an
actual repetition within the *n*-th nominal repetition (as defined in
Clause 6.1.2.1) is given by:

![](media/image799.png){width="3.0586132983377077in"
height="0.4653313648293963in"},

where RB~start~ is the starting RB within the UL BWP, as calculated from
the resource block assignment information of resource allocation type 1
(described in Clause 6.1.2.2.2) and RB~offset~ is the frequency offset
in RBs between the two frequency hops.

*In case of inter-slot frequency hopping, t*he starting RB during slot
follows that of inter-slot frequency hopping for PUSCH Repetition Type A
in Clause 6.3.1.

6.4 UE PUSCH preparation procedure time
---------------------------------------

If the first uplink symbol in the PUSCH allocation for a transport
block, including the DM-RS, as defined by the slot offset *K~2~* and the
start *S* and length *L* of the PUSCH allocation indicated by \'*Time
domain resource assignment*\' of the scheduling DCI and including the
effect of the timing advance, is no earlier than at symbol *L~2~*, where
*L~2~* is defined as the next uplink symbol with its CP starting after
the end of the reception of the last symbol of the PDCCH carrying the
DCI scheduling the PUSCH, then the UE shall transmit the transport
block.

*- N~2~* is based on *µ* of Table 6.4-1 and Table 6.4-2 for UE
processing capability 1 and 2 respectively, where *µ* corresponds to the
one of (*µ~DL~*, *µ~UL~*) resulting with the largest *T~proc,2~*, where
the *µ~DL~* corresponds to the subcarrier spacing of the downlink with
which the PDCCH carrying the DCI scheduling the PUSCH was transmitted
and *µ~UL~* corresponds to the subcarrier spacing of the uplink channel
with which the PUSCH is to be transmitted, and *κ* is defined in clause
4.1 of \[4, TS 38.211\].

*-* For operation with shared spectrum channel access, is calculated
according to \[4, TS 38.211\], otherwise =0.

\- If the first symbol of the PUSCH allocation consists of DM-RS only,
then *d~2,1\ ~*= 0*,* otherwise *d~2,1\ ~*= 1.

\- If the UE is configured with multiple active component carriers, the
first uplink symbol in the PUSCH allocation further includes the effect
of timing difference between component carriers as given in \[11, TS
38.133\].

\- If the scheduling DCI triggered a switch of BWP, *d~2,2~* equals to
the switching time as defined in \[11, TS 38.133\], otherwise
*d~2,2~*=0.

\- If a PUSCH of a larger priority index would overlap with PUCCH of a
smaller priority index, *d~2~* for the PUSCH of a larger priority is set
as reported by the UE; otherwise *d~2~ = 0.*

\- For a UE that supports capability 2 on a given cell, the processing
time according to UE processing capability 2 is applied if the high
layer parameter *processingType2Enabled* in *PUSCH-ServingCellConfig* is
configured for the cell and set to \'*enable\'*,

\- If the PUSCH indicated by the DCI is overlapping with one or more
PUCCH channels, then the transport block is multiplexed following the
procedure in clause 9.2.5 of \[6, TS 38.213\], otherwise the transport
block is transmitted on the PUSCH indicated by the DCI.

\- If uplink switching gap is triggered as defined in clause 6.1.6,
equals to the switching gap duration and for the UE configured with
higher layer parameter *uplinkTxSwitchingOption set to \'dualUL\' for
uplink carrier aggregation* *µ~UL~*=min(*µ~UL,carrier1,~
µ~UL,carrier2~*), otherwise .

Otherwise the UE may ignore the scheduling DCI.

The value of is used both in the case of normal and extended cyclic
prefix.

7 UE procedures for transmitting and receiving on a carrier with intra-cell guard bands
=======================================================================================

For operation with shared spectrum channel access, when the UE is
configured with any of *IntraCellGuardBandsPerSCS* for UL carrier and
for DL carrier with SCS configuration $\mu$, the UE is provided with
$\ N_{RB - set,x} - 1$ intra-cell guard bands on a carrier with $\mu$,
each defined by start CRB and size in number of CRBs,
$GB_{\ s,x}^{start,\mu}\ $ and $GB_{\ s,x}^{size,\mu}\ $, provided by
higher layer parameters *startCRB* and *nrofCRBs*, respectively, where
$s \in \left\{ 0,1,\ldots,N_{\text{RB-set},x} - 2 \right\}$. The
subscript *x* is set to DL and UL for the downlink and uplink,
respectively. Where there is no risk of confusion, the subscript *x* can
be dropped. The intra-cell guard bands separate $N_{RB - set,x}\ $RB
sets, each defined by start and end CRB,
$RB_{\text{\ s},x}^{start,\mu}\ $and $RB_{\text{\ s},x}^{end,\mu}$,
respectively. The UE does not expect that *nrofCRBs* is configured with
non-zero value smaller than the applicable intra-cell guard bands as
specified in \[8, TS 38.101-1\] corresponding to $\mu$ and carrier size
$N_{\text{grid,x}}^{\text{size},\mu}$. The UE determines the start and
end CRB indices for
$s \in \left\{ 0,1,\ldots,N_{\text{RB-set},x} - 1 \right\}$ as

$\text{RB}_{\ s,x}^{\text{start,}\mu} = N_{\text{grid,}x}^{\text{start},\mu} + \left\{ \begin{matrix}
0 & s = 0 \\
GB_{\ s - 1,x}^{\text{start},\mu} + GB_{\ s - 1,x}^{\text{size},\mu} & \text{otherwise} \\
\end{matrix} \right.\ $

and

$\text{RB}_{\ s,x}^{\text{end,}\mu} = N_{\text{grid},x}^{\text{start},\mu} + \left\{ \begin{matrix}
N_{\text{grid},x}^{\text{size},\mu} - 1 & s = N_{\text{RB-set},x} - 1 \\
GB_{\ s,x}^{\text{start},\mu} - 1 & \text{otherwise} \\
\end{matrix} \right.\ $

The RB set with index $s$ consists of $RB_{s,x}^{size,\mu}$ resource
blocks where
$\ RB_{s,x}^{size,\mu} = RB_{\text{\ s},x}^{end,\mu} - RB_{\text{\ s},x}^{start,\mu} + 1$.
When the UE is not configured with *IntraCellGuardBandsPerSCS* for
$\mu$, the UE determines the CRB indices for the intra-cell guard
band(s), if any, and corresponding RB set(s) according to the nominal
intra-cell guard band and RB set pattern as specified in \[8, TS
38.101-1\] corresponding to $\mu$ and carrier size
$N_{\text{grid,}x}^{\text{size},\mu}$. For either or both DL and UL, if
the nominal intra-cell guard band and RB set pattern as specified in
\[8, TS 38.101-1\] contains no intra-cell guard bands, the number of RB
sets for the carrier is $N_{\text{RB}\text{-}set,x} = 1$.

For a carrier with $\mu$, the UE expects
$\ \ N_{\ \text{BWP},i}^{start,\mu} = \text{RB}_{\text{\ s}0,x}^{start,\mu}$
and
$N_{\ \text{BWP},i}^{size,\mu} = \text{RB}_{\text{\ s}1,x}^{end,\mu} - \text{RB}_{\ s0,x}^{start,\mu} + 1\ $
where $0 \leq s0 \leq s1 \leq N_{\text{RB}\text{-}set,x} - 1$ for a BWP
*i* configured by *initialDownlinkBWP* or *BWP-Downlink* for the DL BWP,
or *initialUplinkBWP* or *BWP-Uplink* for the UL BWP. Within the BWP
*i*, RB sets are numbered in increasing order from 0 to
$N_{\text{RB}\text{-}set,x}^{\text{BWP}} - 1\ $ where
$N_{\text{RB}\text{-}set,x}^{\text{BWP}}\ $ is the number of RB sets
contained in the BWP *i* and RB set 0 within the BWP *i* corresponds to
RB set $s0$ in the carrier and RB set
$N_{\text{RB}\text{-}set,x}^{\text{BWP}} - 1$ within the BWP *i*
corresponds to RB set $s1$ in the carrier.

When a UE is provided with *nrofCRBs =* 0 for all intra-cell guard
band(s) on a carrier with $\mu$, the UE is indicated that no intra-cell
guard-bands are configured for the carrier and expects
$N_{RB - set,x} > 1$. For $\mu = 0$, the UE expects the number of RBs
within a RB set is between 100 and 110. For $\mu = 1$, the UE expects
the number of RBs within a RB set is between 50 and 55 except for at
most one RB set which may contain 56 RBs.

8 Physical sidelink shared channel related procedures
=====================================================

A UE can be configured by higher layers with one or more sidelink
resource pools. A sidelink resource pool can be for transmission of
PSSCH, as described in Clause 8.1, or for reception of PSSCH, as
described in Clause 8.3 and can be associated with either sidelink
resource allocation mode 1 or sidelink resource allocation mode 2.

In the frequency domain, a sidelink resource pool consists of
*sl-NumSubchannel* contiguous sub-channels. A sub-channel consists of
*sl-SubchannelSize* contiguous PRBs, where *sl-NumSubchannel* and
*sl-SubchannelSize* are higher layer parameters.

The set of slots that may belong to a sidelink resource pool is denoted
by
$(t_{0}^{\text{SL}},t_{1}^{\text{SL}},\cdots,t_{T_{\max} - 1}^{\text{SL}})$
where

\-
${0 \leq t}_{i}^{\text{SL}} < 10240 \times 2^{\mu},\ 0 \leq i < T_{\max},$

\- the slot index is relative to slot\#0 of the radio frame
corresponding to SFN 0 of the serving cell or DFN 0,

\- the set includes all the slots except the following slots,

\- $N_{S - SSB}$ slots in which S-SS/PSBCH block (S-SSB) is configured,

\- $N_{\text{nonSL}}$ slots in each of which at least one of *Y-th*,
*(Y+1)-th*, ..., *(Y+X-1)-th* OFDM symbols are not semi-statically
configured as UL as per the higher layer parameter
*tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon* of the serving cell if provided or
*sl-TDD-Configuration* if provided or *sl-TDD-Config* of the received
PSBCH if provided, where *Y* and *X* are set by the higher layer
parameters *sl-StartSymbol* and *sl-LengthSymbols*, respectively.

\- The reserved slots which are determined by the following steps.

> 1\) the remaining slots excluding $N_{S - SSB}$ slots and
> $N_{\text{nonSL}}$ slots from the set of all the slots are denoted by
> $(l_{0},l_{1},\cdots,l_{(10240 \times 2^{\mu} - N_{S - SSB}\  - N_{\text{nonSL}} - 1)})$
> arranged in increasing order of slot index.
>
> 2\) a slot
> $l_{r}\ (0 \leq r < 10240 \times 2^{\mu} - N_{S - SSB} - N_{\text{nonSL}})$
> belongs to the reserved slots if
> $r = \left\lfloor \frac{m \bullet (10240 \times 2^{\mu} - N_{S - SSB} - N_{\text{nonSL}})}{N_{\text{reserved}}} \right\rfloor$,
> here $m = 0,1,\cdots,N_{\text{reserved}} - 1$ and
> $N_{\text{reserved}} = \left( 10240 \times 2^{\mu} - N_{S - SSB} - N_{\text{nonSL}} \right)\text{\ mod\ }L_{\text{bitmap}}$
> where $L_{\text{bitmap}}$ denotes the length of bitmap configured by
> higher layers.

\- The slots in the set are arranged in increasing order of slot index.

The UE determines the set of slots assigned to a sidelink resource pool
as follows:

\- a bitmap
$\left( b_{0},b_{1},\ldots,b_{L_{\text{bitmap}} - 1} \right)$ associated
with the resource pool is used where $L_{\text{bitmap}}$ the length of
the bitmap is configured by higher layers.

\- a slot
$t_{k}^{\text{SL}}\ (0 \leq k < 10240 \times 2^{\mu} - N_{S - SSB} - N_{\text{nonSL}} - N_{\text{reserved}})$
belongs to the set if $b_{k^{'}} = 1$ where
$k^{'} = k\ mod\ L_{\text{bitmap}}$.

\- The slots in the set are re-indexed such that the subscripts *i* of
the remaining slots ${t'}_{i}^{\text{SL}}$ are successive {0, 1, ...,
${T'}_{\max} - 1\}$ where ${T'}_{\max}$ is the number of the slots
remaining in the set.

The UE determines the set of resource blocks assigned to a sidelink
resource pool as follows:

\- The resource block pool consists of $N_{\text{PRB}}$ PRBs.

\- The sub-channel *m* for $m = 0,1,\cdots,numSubchannel - 1$ consists
of a set of $n_{\text{subCHsize}}$ contiguous resource blocks with the
physical resource block number
$n_{\text{PRB}} = n_{\text{subCHRBstart}} + m \bullet n_{\text{subCHsize}} + j$
for $j = 0,1,\cdots,n_{\text{subCHsize}} - 1$, where
$n_{\text{subCHRBstart}}$ and $n_{\text{subCHsize}}$ are given by higher
layer parameters *sl-StartRB-Subchannel* and *sl-SubchannelSize*,
respectively

A UE is not expected to use the last
$N_{\text{PRB}}\ \text{mod}\ n_{\text{subCHsize}}$ PRBs in the resource
pool.

8.1 UE procedure for transmitting the physical sidelink shared channel
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Each PSSCH transmission is associated with an PSCCH transmission.

That PSCCH transmission carries the 1^st^ stage of the SCI associated
with the PSSCH transmission; the 2^nd^ stage of the associated SCI is
carried within the resource of the PSSCH.

If the UE transmits SCI format 1-A on PSCCH according to a PSCCH
resource configuration in slot *n* and PSCCH resource *m*, then for the
associated PSSCH transmission in the same slot

\- one transport block is transmitted with up to two layers;

\- The number of layers (ʋ) is determined according to the \'*Number of
DMRS port\'* field in the SCI;

\- The set of consecutive symbols within the slot for transmission of
the PSSCH is determined according to clause 8.1.2.1;

\- The set of contiguous resource blocks for transmission of the PSSCH
is determined according to clause 8.1.2.2;

Transform precoding is not supported for PSSCH transmission.

Only wideband precoding is supported for PSSCH transmission.

The DM-RS antenna ports
![cid:image011.png\@01D5F222.20AEBCB0](media/image805.png){width="0.6465277777777778in"
height="0.21736111111111112in"} in Clause 8.4.1.1.2 of \[4, TS38.211\]
are determined according to the ordering of DM-RS port(s) given by
Tables 8.3.1.1-3 in Clause 8.3.1.1 of \[5, TS 38.212\].

The UE shall set the contents of the SCI format 2-A as follows:

\- the UE shall set value of the *\'HARQ process number\'* field as
indicated by higher layers.

\- the UE shall set value of the \'*NDI*\' field as indicated by higher
layers.

\- the UE shall set value of the \'*Redundancy version*\' field as
indicated by higher layers.

\- the UE shall set value of the \'*Source ID*\' field as indicated by
higher layers.

\- the UE shall set value of the \'*Destination ID*\' field as indicated
by higher layers.

\- the UE shall set value of the \'*HARQ feedback enabled/disabled
indicator*\' field as indicated by higher layers.

\- the UE shall set value of the \'*Cast type indicator*\' field as
indicated by higher layers.

\- the UE shall set value of the \'*CSI request*\' field as indicated by
higher layers.

The UE shall set the contents of the SCI formats 2-B as follows:

\- the UE shall set value of the \'*HARQ process number*\' field as
indicated by higher layers.

\- the UE shall set value of the \'*NDI*\' field as indicated by higher
layers.

\- the UE shall set value of the \'*Redundancy version*\' field as
indicated by higher layers.

\- the UE shall set value of the \'*Source ID*\' field as indicated by
higher layers.

\- the UE shall set value of the \'*Destination ID*\' field as indicated
by higher layers.

\- the UE shall set value of the \'*HARQ feedback enabled/disabled
indicator*\' field as indicated by higher layers.

\- the UE shall set value of the \'*Zone ID*\' field as indicated by
higher layers.

\- the UE shall set the \'*Communication range requirement*\' field as
indicated by higher layers.

### 8.1.1 Transmission schemes

Only one transmission scheme is defined for the PSSCH and is used for
all PSSCH transmissions.

PSSCH transmission is performed with up to two antenna ports, with
antenna ports 1000-1001 as defined in clause 8.2.4 of \[4, TS 38.211\].

### 8.1.2 Resource allocation

In sidelink resource allocation mode 1:

\- for PSSCH and PSCCH transmission, dynamic grant, configured grant
type 1 and configured grant type 2 are supported. The configured grant
Type 2 sidelink transmission is semi-persistently scheduled by a SL
grant in a valid activation DCI according to Clause 10.2A of \[6, TS
38.213\].

#### 8.1.2.1 Resource allocation in time domain

The UE shall transmit the PSSCH in the same slot as the associated
PSCCH.

The minimum resource allocation unit in the time domain is a slot.

The UE shall transmit the PSSCH in consecutive symbols within the slot,
subject to the following restrictions:

\- The UE shall not transmit PSSCH in symbols which are not configured
for sidelink. A symbol is configured for sidelink, according to higher
layer parameters *sl-StartSymbol* and *sl-LengthSymbols*, where
*sl-StartSymbol* is the symbol index of the first symbol of
*sl-LengthSymbols* consecutive symbols configured for sidelink.

\- Within the slot, PSSCH resource allocation starts at symbol
*sl-StartSymbol+1.*

\- The UE shall not transmit PSSCH in symbols which are configured for
use by PSFCH, if PSFCH is configured in this slot.

\- The UE shall not transmit PSSCH in the last symbol configured for
sidelink.

\- The UE shall not transmit PSSCH in the symbol immediately preceding
the symbols which are configured for use by PSFCH, if PSFCH is
configured in this slot.

In sidelink resource allocation mode 1:

\- For sidelink dynamic grant, the PSSCH transmission is scheduled by a
DCI format 3\_0.

\- For sidelink configured grant type 2, the configured grant is
activated by a DCI format 3\_0.

\- For sidelink dynamic grant and sidelink configured grant type 2:

\- The \"Time gap\" field value *m* of the DCI format 3\_0 provides an
index *m* + 1 into a slot offset table. That table is given by higher
layer parameter *sl-DCI-ToSL-Trans* and the table value at index *m* + 1
will be referred to as slot offset $K_{\text{SL}}$.

**- The slot of the first sidelink transmission scheduled by the DCI is
the first SL slot of the corresponding resource pool that starts not
earlier than**
$T_{\text{DL}} - \frac{T_{\text{TA}}}{2} + K_{\text{SL}} \times T_{\text{slot}}$**,
where** $T_{\text{DL}}$ **is the starting time of the downlink slot
carrying the corresponding DCI,** $T_{\text{TA}}$ **is the timing
advance value corresponding to the TAG of the serving cell on which the
DCI is received and** $K_{\text{SL}}\ $**is the slot offset between the
slot of the DCI and the first sidelink transmission scheduled by DCI
and** $T_{\text{slot}}\ $ **is the SL slot duration.**

**- The \"Configuration index\" field of the DCI format 3\_0, if
provided and not reserved, indicates the index of the sidelink
configured type 2.**

\- For sidelink configured grant type 1:

\- The slot of the first sidelink transmissions follows the higher layer
configuration according to \[10, TS 38.321\].

#### 8.1.2.2 Resource allocation in frequency domain

The resource allocation unit in the frequency domain is the sub-channel.

The sub-channel assignment for sidelink transmission is determined using
the \"Frequency resource assignment\" field in the associated SCI.

The lowest sub-channel for sidelink transmission is the sub-channel on
which the lowest PRB of the associated PSCCH is transmitted.

If a PSSCH scheduled by a PSCCH would overlap with resources containing
the PSCCH, the resources corresponding to a union of the PSCCH that
scheduled the PSSCH and associated PSCCH DM-RS are not available for the
PSSCH.

### 8.1.3 Modulation order, target code rate, redundancy version and transport block size determination

The redundancy version is given by the \"Redundancy version\" field in
SCI format 2-A or 2-B.

#### 8.1.3.1 Modulation order and target code rate determination

*I~MCS\ ~*is given by the \'*Modulation and coding scheme*\' field in
SCI format 1-A.

The MCS table is determined as follows: Table 5.1.3.1-1 is used if no
additional MCS table is configured by higher layer parameter
*sl-Additional-MCS-Table*; otherwise an MCS table is determined
according to Table 8.1.3.1-1 or Table 8.1.3.1-2 and \'*Additional* *MCS
table indicator*\' field in SCI format 1-A.

Table 8.1.3.1-1: Mapping of one bit of MCS table indicator to MCS table

  --------------------- --------------------------------------------------------------------------

The UE shall use *I~MCS~* and the MCS table determined according to the
previous step to determine the modulation order (*Q~m~*) and Target code
rate (*R*) used in the physical sidelink shared channel.

#### 8.1.3.2 Transport block size determination

For the PSSCH assigned by SCI, if Table 5.1.3.1-2 is used and
$0\  \leq \ I_{\text{MCS\ }} \leq 27$*,* or a table other than Table
5.1.3.1-2 is used and $0\  \leq \ I_{\text{MCS\ }} \leq 28$*,* the UE
shall first determine the TBS as specified below:

The UE shall first determine the number of REs (*N~RE~*) within the
slot.

\- A UE first determines the number of REs allocated for PSSCH within a
PRB ($N_{\text{RE}}^{'}$) by
$N_{\text{RE}}^{'} = N_{\text{sc}}^{\text{RB}}\left( N_{\text{symb}}^{\text{sh}} - N_{\text{symb}}^{\text{PSFCH}} \right) - N_{\text{oh}}^{\text{PRB}} - N_{\text{RE}}^{\text{DMRS}}$*,
where*

\- $N_{\text{sc}}^{\text{RB}} = 12$ is the number of subcarriers in a
physical resource block,

\- $N_{\text{symb}}^{\text{sh}}$$N_{\text{symb}}^{\text{slot}}$ =
*sl-LengthSymbols* -2, where *sl-LengthSymbols* is the number of
sidelink symbols within the slot provided by higher layers,

\- $N_{\text{symb}}^{\text{PSFCH}}$ = 3 if \'*PSFCH overhead
indication\'* field of SCI format 1-A indicates \"1\", and
$N_{\text{symb}}^{\text{PSFCH}}$ = 0 otherwise, if higher layer
parameter *sl-PSFCH-Period* is 2 or 4. If higher layer parameter
*sl-PSFCH-Period* is 0, $N_{\text{symb}}^{\text{PSFCH}} = 0$. If higher
layer parameter *sl-PSFCH-Period* is 1,
$N_{\text{symb}}^{\text{PSFCH}} = 3$.

\- $N_{\text{oh}}^{\text{PRB}}$ is the overhead given by higher layer
parameter *sl-X-Overhead*,

\- $N_{\text{RE}}^{\text{DMRS}}$ is given by Table 8.1.3.2-1 according
to higher layer parameter *sl-PSSCH-DMRS-TimePatternList.*

\- A UE determines the total number of REs allocated for PSSCH
()$N_{\text{RE}})$ by
$N_{\text{RE}} = N_{\text{RE}}^{'} \bullet n_{\text{PRB}} - N_{\text{RE}}^{\text{SCI},1} - N_{\text{RE}}^{\text{SCI},2}$$N_{\text{RE}} = \ {\overline{N}}_{\text{RE}}^{'}*\ n_{\text{PRB}}$,
where

\- *n~PRB~* is the total number of allocated PRBs for the PSSCH,

\- $N_{\text{RE}}^{\text{SCI},1}$ is the total number of REs occupied by
the PSCCH and PSCCH DM-RS.

\- $N_{\text{RE}}^{\text{SCI},2}$ is the number of coded modulation
symbols generated for 2^nd^-stage SCI transmission (prior to duplication
for the 2^nd^ layer, if present) according to Clause 8.4.4 of \[5, TS
38.212\], with the assumption of $\gamma = 0$.

The UE determines TBS according to Steps 2), 3), and 4) in clause
5.1.3.2.

> A UE is not expected to receive an SCI indicating
> $28 \leq I_{\text{MCS}} \leq 31$ if Table 5.1.3.1-2 is used, or
> $29 \leq I_{\text{MCS}} \leq 31$ otherwise.

### 8.1.4 UE procedure for determining the subset of resources to be reported to higher layers in PSSCH resource selection in sidelink resource allocation mode 2

In resource allocation mode 2, the higher layer can request the UE to
determine a subset of resources from which the higher layer will select
resources for PSSCH/PSCCH transmission. To trigger this procedure, in
slot *n,* the higher layer provides the following parameters for this
PSSCH/PSCCH transmission:

\- the resource pool from which the resources are to be reported;

\- L1 priority, $\text{pri}o_{\text{TX}}$;

\- the remaining packet delay budget;

\- the number of sub-channels to be used for the PSSCH/PSCCH
transmission in a slot, $L_{\text{subCH}}$;

\- optionally, the resource reservation interval, $P_{\text{rsvp\_TX}}$,
in units of msec.

\- if the higher layer requests the UE to determine a subset of
resources from which the higher layer will select resources for
PSSCH/PSCCH transmission as part of re-evaluation or pre-emption
procedure, the higher layer provides a set of resources
$(r_{0},r_{1},r_{2},\ldots)\ $which may be subject to re-evaluation and
a set of resources $(r_{0}^{'},r_{1}^{'},r_{2}^{'},\ldots)\ $which may
be subject to pre-emption.

\- it is up to UE implementation to determine the subset of resources as
requested by higher layers before or after the slot $r_{i}^{''}$ -
$T_{3}$, where $r_{i}^{''}$ is the slot with the smallest slot index
among $(r_{0},r_{1},r_{2},\ldots)\ $and
$(r_{0}^{'},r_{1}^{'},r_{2}^{'},\ldots)\ $, and $T_{3}$ is equal to
$T_{proc,1}^{\text{SL}}$, *where* $T_{proc,1}^{\text{SL}}\ $* is defined
in slots in Table 8.1.4-2 where* $\mu_{\text{SL}}$ *is the SCS
configuration of the SL BWP.*

The following higher layer parameters affect this procedure:

*- sl-SelectionWindowList:* internal parameter $T_{2min}$ is set to the
corresponding value from higher layer parameter *sl-SelectionWindowList*
for the given value of $\text{pri}o_{\text{TX}}$.

*- sl-Thres-RSRP-List*: this higher layer parameter provides an RSRP
threshold for each combination $\left( p_{i},\, p_{j} \right)$, where
$p_{i}$ is the value of the priority field in a received SCI format 1-A
and $p_{j}$ is the priority of the transmission of the UE selecting
resources; for a given invocation of this procedure,
$p_{j}\  = \ \text{pri}o_{\text{TX}}$.

*- sl-RS-ForSensing* selects if the UE uses the PSSCH-RSRP or PSCCH-RSRP
measurement, as defined in clause 8.4.2.1.

*- sl-ResourceReservePeriodList*

*- sl-SensingWindow*: internal parameter $T_{0}$ is defined as the
number of slots corresponding to *sl-SensingWindow* msec

*- sl-TxPercentageList: internal parameter* $X$ *for a given*
$\text{pri}o_{\text{TX}}$ *is defined as sl-TxPercentageList
(*$\text{pri}o_{\text{TX}}$*) converted from percentage to ratio*

*- sl-PreemptionEnable: if sl-PreemptionEnable is provided, and if it is
not equal to \'enabled\', internal parameter* $\text{pri}o_{\text{pre}}$
*is set to the higher layer provided parameter sl-PreemptionEnable*

The resource reservation interval, $P_{\text{rsvp\_TX}}$, if provided,
is converted from units of msec to units of logical slots, resulting in
$P_{\text{rsvp}\text{\_}\text{TX}}^{'}$ according to clause 8.1.7.

Notation:

$\left( {t'}_{0}^{\text{SL}},\ {t'}_{1}^{\text{SL}},\ {t'}_{2}^{\text{SL}},\ldots \right)$
denotes the set of slots which belongs to the sidelink resource pool and
is defined in Clause 8.

The following steps are used:

1\) A candidate single-slot resource for transmission $R_{\text{x,y}}$
is defined as a set of $L_{\text{subCH}}$ contiguous sub-channels with
sub-channel *x+j* in slot ${t'}_{y}^{\text{SL}}$ where
$j = 0,...,L_{\text{subCH}} - 1$. The UE shall assume that any set of
$L_{\text{subCH}}$ contiguous sub-channels included in the corresponding
resource pool within the time interval
$\lbrack n + T_{1},n + T_{2}\rbrack$ correspond to one candidate
single-slot resource, where

\- selection of $T_{1}$ is up to UE implementation under
$0\  \leq \ T_{1} \leq$ $T_{proc,1}^{\text{SL}}\ $ , where
$T_{proc,1}^{\text{SL}}\ $ is defined in slots in Table 8.1.4-2 where
$\mu_{\text{SL}}$ is the SCS configuration of the SL BWP;

\- if $\text{\ T}_{2min}$ is shorter than the remaining packet delay
budget (in slots) then $T_{2}\ $is up to UE implementation subject to
$T_{2min}\  \leq \ T_{2}$ $\leq$ remaining packet delay budget (in
slots); otherwise $T_{2}\ $is set to the remaining packet delay budget
(in slots).

The total number of candidate single-slot resources is denoted by
$M_{\text{total}}$.

2\) The sensing window is defined by the range of slots
\[$n\, –T_{0},n–T_{\text{proc},0}^{\text{SL}}$) where $T_{0}$ is defined
above and $T_{\text{proc},0}^{\text{SL}}$ is defined in slots in Table
8.1.4-1 where $\mu_{\text{SL}}$ is the SCS configuration of the SL BWP.
The UE shall monitor slots which belongs to a sidelink resource pool
within the sensing window except for those in which its own
transmissions occur. The UE shall perform the behaviour in the following
steps based on PSCCH decoded and RSRP measured in these slots.

3\) The internal parameter $Th(p_{i},p_{j})\ $ is set to the
corresponding value of RSRP threshold indicated by the *i*-th field in
*sl-Thres-RSRP-List*, where $i = p_{i} + \left( p_{j} - 1 \right)*8$.

4\) The set $S_{A}$ is initialized to the set of all the candidate
single-slot resources.

5\) The UE shall exclude any candidate single-slot resource
$R_{\text{x,y}}$ from the set $S_{A}$ if it meets all the following
conditions:

\- the UE has not monitored slot ${t'}_{m}^{\text{SL}}$ in Step 2.

\- for any periodicity value allowed by the higher layer parameter
*sl-ResourceReservePeriodList* and a hypothetical SCI format 1-A
received in slot ${t'}_{m}^{\text{SL}}$ with \'*Resource reservation
period*\' field set to that periodicity value and indicating all
subchannels of the resource pool in this slot, condition c in step 6
would be met.

5a) If the number of candidate single-slot resources $R_{\text{x,y}}$
remaining in the set $S_{A}$ is smaller than $X \cdot M_{\text{total}}$,
the set $S_{A}$ is initialized to the set of all the candidate
single-slot resources as in step 4.

6\) The UE shall exclude any candidate single-slot resource
$R_{\text{x,y}}$ from the set $S_{A}$ if it meets all the following
conditions:

a\) the UE receives an SCI format 1-A in slot ${t'}_{m}^{\text{SL}}$,
and \'*Resource reservation period\'* field, if present, and
\'*Priority*\' field in the received SCI format 1-A indicate the values
$P_{\text{rsvp\_RX}}$ and $\text{pri}o_{\text{RX}}$, respectively
according to Clause 16.4 in \[6, TS 38.213\];

b\) the RSRP measurement performed, according to clause 8.4.2.1 for the
received SCI format 1-A, is higher than
$Th\left( \text{pri}o_{\text{RX}},prio_{\text{TX}} \right);$

c\) the SCI format received in slot ${t'}_{m}^{\text{SL}}\ $or the same
SCI format which, if and only if the \'*Resource reservation period*\'
field is present in the received SCI format 1-A, is assumed to be
received in slot(s)
${t'}_{m + q \times P_{\text{rsvp}\text{\_}\text{RX}}^{'}}^{\text{SL}}$
determines according to clause 8.1.5 the set of resource blocks and
slots which overlaps with $R_{x,y + j \times P_{rsvp\_ TX}^{'}}$ for
*q*=1, 2, ..., *Q* and *j=*0, 1, ..., $C_{\text{resel}} - 1$. Here,
$P_{\text{rsvp}\text{\_}\text{RX}}^{'}$ is $P_{\text{rsvp\_RX}}$
converted to units of logical slots according to clause 8.1.7,
$Q = \left\lceil \frac{T_{\text{scal}}}{P_{\text{rsvp}\text{\_}\text{RX}}} \right\rceil\ $
if $P_{rsvp\_ RX} < \ T_{\text{scal}}$ and
$\ n^{'} - m \leq P_{\text{rsvp}\text{\_}\text{RX}}^{'}$, where
${t'}_{n^{'}}^{\text{SL}}\  = \ n$ if slot *n* belongs to the set
$\left( {t'}_{0}^{\text{SL}},{t'}_{1}^{\text{SL}},...,{t'}_{{T'}_{\max} - 1}^{\text{SL}} \right)$,
otherwise slot ${t'}_{n^{'}}^{\text{SL}}$ is the first slot after slot
*n* belonging to the set
$\left( {t'}_{0}^{\text{SL}},{t'}_{1}^{\text{SL}},...,{t'}_{{T'}_{\max} - 1}^{\text{SL}} \right)$;
otherwise $Q = 1$. $T_{\text{scal}}$ is set to selection window size
*T~2~* converted to units of *msec*.

7\) If the number of candidate single-slot resources remaining in the
set $S_{A}$ is smaller than $X \cdot M_{\text{total}}$, then
$Th(p_{i},p_{j})$ is increased by 3 dB for each priority value
$Th(p_{i},p_{j})$ and the procedure continues with step 4.

The UE shall report set $S_{A}$ to higher layers.

If a resource $r_{i}$ from the set $(r_{0},r_{1},r_{2},\ldots)$ is not a
member of $S_{A}$, then the UE shall report re-evaluation of the
resource $r_{i}$ to higher layers.

If a resource $r_{i}^{'}$ from the set
$(r_{0}^{'},r_{1}^{'},r_{2}^{'},\ldots)$ meets the conditions below then
the UE shall report pre-emption of the resource $r_{i}^{'}$ to higher
layers

\- $r_{i}^{'}$ is not a member of $S_{A}$, and

\- $r_{i}^{'}$ meets the conditions for exclusion in step 6, with
$Th\left( \text{pri}o_{\text{RX}},prio_{\text{TX}} \right)$ set to the
final threshold after executing steps 1)-7), i.e. including all
necessary increments for reaching $X \cdot M_{\text{total}}$, and

\- the associated priority $\text{pri}o_{\text{RX}},$ satisfies one of
the following conditions:

\- *sl-PreemptionEnable* is provided and is equal to \'enabled\' and
$\text{pri}o_{\text{TX}} > \text{pri}o_{\text{RX}}$

\- *sl-PreemptionEnable* is provided and is not equal to \'enabled\',
and $\text{pri}o_{\text{RX}} < \text{pri}o_{\text{pre}}$ and
$\text{pri}o_{\text{TX}} > \text{pri}o_{\text{RX}}$

### 8.1.5 UE procedure for determining slots and resource blocks for PSSCH transmission associated with an SCI format 1-A

The set of slots and resource blocks for PSSCH transmission is
determined by the resource used for the PSCCH transmission containing
the associated SCI format 1-A, and fields \'*Frequency resource
assignment*\', \'*Time resource assignment*\' of the associated SCI
format 1-A as described below.

\'*Time resource assignment*\' carries logical slot offset indication of
N = 1 or 2 actual resources when *sl-MaxNumPerReserve* is 2, and N = 1
or 2 or 3 actual resources when *sl-MaxNumPerReserve* is 3, in a form of
time RIV (TRIV) field which is determined as follows:

if $N = 1$

$\text{TRIV} = 0$

elseif $N = 2$

$\text{TRIV} = t_{1}$

else

if $\left( t_{2} - t_{1} - 1 \right) \leq 15$

$\text{TRIV} = 30\left( t_{2} - t_{1} - 1 \right) + t_{1} + 31$

else

$\text{TRIV} = 30\left( 31 - t_{2} + t_{1} \right) + 62 - t_{1}$

end if

end if

where the first resource is in the slot where SCI format 1-A was
received, and $t_{i}$ denotes i-th resource time offset in logical slots
of a resource pool with respect to the first resource where for N = 2,
$1 \leq t_{1} \leq 31$; and for N = 3, $1 \leq t_{1} \leq 30$,
$t_{1} < t_{2} \leq 31$.

The starting sub-channel $n_{subCH,0}^{\text{start}}$ of the first
resource is determined according to clause 8.1.2.2. The number of
contiguously allocated sub-channels for each of the N resources
$L_{\text{subCH}} \geq 1$ and the starting sub-channel indexes of
resources indicated by the received SCI format 1-A, except the resource
in the slot where SCI format 1-A was received, are determined from
\"Frequency resource assignment\" which is equal to a frequency RIV
(FRIV) where.

If *sl-MaxNumPerReserve* is 2 then

$\text{FRIV} = n_{\text{subCH},1}^{\text{start}} + \sum_{i = 1}^{L_{\text{subCH}} - 1}\left( N_{\text{\ subchannel}}^{\text{\ }\text{SL}} + 1 - i \right)$

If *sl-MaxNumPerReserve is* 3 then

$\text{FRIV} = n_{\text{subCH},1}^{\text{start}} + n_{\text{subCH},2}^{\text{start}} \cdot \left( N_{\text{\ subchannel}}^{\text{\ }\text{SL}} + 1 - L_{\text{subCH}} \right) + \sum_{i = 1}^{L_{\text{subCH}} - 1}\left( N_{\text{\ subchannel}}^{\text{\ }\text{SL}} + 1 - i \right)^{2}$

where

\- $n_{subCH,1}^{\text{start}}$ denotes the starting sub-channel index
for the second resource

\- $n_{subCH,2}^{\text{start}}$ denotes the starting sub-channel index
for the third resource

\- $N_{\text{\ subchannel}}^{\text{\ }\text{SL}}$ *is the number of
sub-channels in a resource pool provided according to the higher layer
parameter sl-NumSubchannel*

If TRIV indicates *N* \< *sl-MaxNumPerReserve*, the starting sub-channel
indexes corresponding to *sl-MaxNumPerReserve* minus N last resources
are not used.

The number of slots in one set of the time and frequency resources for
transmission opportunities of PSSCH is given by $C_{\text{resel}}$ where
$C_{\text{resel}}$= 10\*SL\_RESOURCE\_RESELECTION\_COUNTER \[10, TS
38.321\] if configured else $C_{\text{resel}}$ is set to 1.

If a set of sub-channels in slot ${t'}_{m}^{\text{SL}}$ is determined as
the time and frequency resource for PSSCH transmission corresponding to
the selected sidelink grant (described in \[10, TS 38.321\]), the same
set of sub-channels in slots
${t'}_{m + j \times P_{rsvp\_ TX}^{'}}^{\text{SL}}$ are also determined
for PSSCH transmissions corresponding to the same sidelink grant where
*j=*1, 2,*...,* $C_{\text{resel}} - 1$, $P_{\text{rsvp\_TX}}$, if
provided, is converted from units of *msec* to units of logical slots,
resulting in $P_{\text{rsvp}\text{\_}\text{TX}}^{'}$ according to clause
8.1.7, and
$\left( {t'}_{0}^{\text{SL}},\ {t'}_{1}^{\text{SL}},\ {t'}_{2}^{\text{SL}},\ldots \right)$
is determined by Clause 8. Here, $P_{\text{rsvp\_TX}}$ is the resource
reservation interval indicated by higher layers.

### 8.1.6 Sidelink congestion control in sidelink resource allocation mode 2

If a UE is configured with higher layer parameter *sl-CR-Limit* and
transmits PSSCH in slot *n*, the UE shall ensure the following limits
for any priority value k;

$\sum_{i \geq k}^{}{\text{CR}\left( i \right)} \leq CR_{\text{Limit}}\left( k \right)$

where $\text{CR}\left( i \right)$ is the CR evaluated in slot *n*-*N*
for the PSSCH transmissions with \'*Priority*\' field in the SCI set to
*i*, and $CR_{\text{Limit}}\left( k \right)$ corresponds to the high
layer parameter *sl-CR-Limit* that is associated with the priority value
*k* and the CBR range which includes the CBR measured in slot *n*-*N*,
where *N* is the congestion control processing time.

The congestion control processing time *N* is based on µ of Table
8.1.6-1 and Table 8.1.6-2 for UE processing capability 1 and 2
respectively, where µ corresponds to the subcarrier spacing of the
sidelink channel with which the PSSCH is to be transmitted. A UE shall
only apply a single processing time capability in sidelink congestion
control.

Table 8.1.6-1: Congestion control processing time for processing timing
capability 1

  **µ**   Congestion control processing time N \[slots\]
  ------- ------------------------------------------------
  0       2
  1       2
  2       4
  3       8

  ------- ------------------------------------------------
  0       2
  1       4
  2       8
  3       16

It is up to UE implementation how to meet the above limits, including
dropping the transmissions in slot *n*.

### 8.1.7 UE procedure for determining the number of logical slots for a reservation period 

A given resource reservation period $P_{\text{rsvp}}$ in milliseconds is
converted to a period $P_{\text{rsvp}}^{'}$ in logical slots as:

$$P_{\text{rsvp}}^{'} = \left\lceil \frac{{T'}_{\max}\ }{10240\ ms} \times P_{\text{rsvp}} \right\rceil$$

![](media/image806.png)where ${T'}_{\max}$ is the number of slots that
belong to a resource pool as defined in Clause 8.

8.2 UE procedure for transmitting sidelink reference signals
------------------------------------------------------------

### 8.2.1 CSI-RS transmission procedure

A UE transmits sidelink CSI-RS within a unicast PSSCH transmission if
the following conditions hold:

\- CSI reporting is enabled by higher layer parameter
*sl-CSI-Acquisition*; and

\- the \'*CSI request*\' field in the corresponding SCI format 2-A is
set to 1.

The following parameters for CSI-RS transmission are configured for each
CSI-RS configuration:

\- *sl-CSI-RS-FirstSymbol* indicates the first OFDM symbol in a PRB used
for SL CSI-RS

\- *sl-CSI-RS-FreqAllocation* indicates the number of antenna ports and
the frequency domain allocation for SL CSI-RS.

When the UE is configured with *Q~p~*={1,2} CSI-RS port(s) in sidelink
and the number of scheduled layers is $n_{\text{layer}}^{\text{PSSCH}}$,

\- The CSI-RS scaling factor $\beta_{\text{CSIRS}}$ specified in clause
8.4.1.5.3 of \[4, TS 38.211\] is given by
$\beta_{\text{CSIRS}} = \beta_{\text{DMRS}}^{\text{PSSCH}} \bullet \sqrt{\frac{n_{\text{layer}}^{\text{PSSCH}}}{Q_{p}}}\ $
where $\beta_{\text{DMRS}}^{\text{PSSCH}}$ is the scaling factor for the
corresponding PSSCH specified in clause 8.3.1.5 of \[4, TS 38.211\].

### 8.2.2 PSSCH DM-RS transmission procedure

The UE selects the DM-RS time domain pattern out of the patterns
configured using the higher layer parameter
*sl-PSSCH-DMRS-TimePatternList* for the resource pool on which the PSSCH
is to be transmitted. If more than one DM-RS time domain pattern is
configured, the selected pattern is indicated by the \'*DMRS pattern\'*
field in the SCI format 1-A associated with the PSSCH transmission.

If PSSCH DM-RS and PSCCH are mapped to the same OFDM symbol, then this
mapping within a single sub-channel is only supported if higher layer
parameter *sl-SubchannelSize* \>= 20, i.e. the sub-channel size is at
least 20 PRBs.

When a sub-channel size is less than 20 PRBs and the size of PSCCH is
less than the sub-channel size, a UE is not expected to choose a PSSCH
DM-RS pattern to be transmitted in the same OFDM symbol with PSCCH.

### 8.2.3 PT-RS transmission procedure

Transmission of PT-RS is only supported in frequency range 2.

The UE PT-RS transmission procedure specified in clause 6.2.3.1 applies
for derivation of the PT-RS parameters *L~PT-RS~* and*~,~ K~PT-RS\ ~*and
for determination of PT-RS presence, with the following changes:

\- *timeDensity* and *frequencyDensity* in *PTRS-UplinkConfig* are
replaced by *sl-PTRS-TimeDensity* and *sl-PTRS-FreqDensity* in
*SL-PTRS-Config* respectively, and *SL-PTRS-Config* is (pre)configured
per resource pool;

\- the number of antenna ports is the same as the number of PSSCH DM-RS
antenna ports and the association between a PT-RS antenna port and a
PSSCH DM-RS antenna port is fixed.

8.3 UE procedure for receiving the physical sidelink shared channel
-------------------------------------------------------------------

For sidelink resource allocation mode 1, a UE upon detection of SCI
format 1-A on PSCCH can decode PSSCH according to the detected SCI
formats 2-A and 2-B, and associated PSSCH resource configuration
configured by higher layers. The UE is not required to decode more than
one PSCCH at each PSCCH resource candidate.

For sidelink resource allocation mode 2, a UE upon detection of SCI
format 1-A on PSCCH can decode PSSCH according to the detected SCI
formats 2-A and 2-B, and associated PSSCH resource configuration
configured by higher layers. The UE is not required to decode more than
one PSCCH at each PSCCH resource candidate.

A UE is required to decode neither the corresponding SCI formats 2-A and
2-B nor the PSSCH associated with an SCI format 1-A if the SCI format
1-A indicates an MCS table that the UE does not support.

8.4 UE procedure for receiving reference signals
------------------------------------------------

### 8.4.1 CSI-RS reception procedure

The CSI-RS defined in Clause 8.4.1.5 of \[4, TS 38.211\] may be used for
CSI computation.

### 8.4.2 DM-RS reception procedure for RSRP computation

8.4.2.1 RSRP for resource selection in sidelink resource allocation mode
2

In sidelink resource allocation mode 2, the UE measures RSRP for
resource selection as follows:

\- PSSCH-RSRP over the DM-RS resource elements for the PSSCH according
to the received SCI format 1-A if higher layer parameter
*sl-RS-ForSensing* is set to \'*pssch\'*, and

\- PSCCH-RSRP over the DM-RS resource elements for the PSCCH carrying
the received SCI format 1-A if higher layer parameter *sl-RS-ForSensing*
is set to \'*pscch\'*.

### 8.4.3 PT-RS reception procedure

Reception of PT-RS is only supported in frequency range 2.

The UE PT-RS reception procedure specified in clause 5.1.6.3 applies for
derivation of the PT-RS parameters *L~PT-RS~* and *K~PT-RS\ ~*and for
determination of PT-RS presence, with the following changes:

\- *timeDensity* and f*requencyDensity* in *PTRS-DownlinkConfig* are
replaced by *sl-PTRS-TimeDensity* and *sl-PTRS-FreqDensity* in
*SL-PTRS-Config* respectively, and *SL-PTRS-Config* is (pre)configured
per resource pool;

\- the number of antenna ports is the same as the number of PSSCH DM-RS
antenna ports and the association between a PT-RS antenna port and a
PSSCH DM-RS antenna port is fixed.

8.5 UE procedure for reporting channel state information (CSI)
--------------------------------------------------------------

### 8.5.1 Channel state information framework

CSI consists of Channel Quality Indicator (CQI) and Rank Indicator (RI).
The CQI and RI are always reported together.

#### 8.5.1.1 Reporting configurations

The UE shall calculate CSI parameters (if reported) assuming the
following dependencies between CSI parameters (if reported)

\- CQI shall be calculated conditioned on the reported RI

The CSI reporting can be aperiodic (using \[10, TS 38.321\]). Table
8.5.1.1-1 shows the supported combinations of CSI reporting
configurations and CSI-RS configurations and how the CSI reporting is
triggered for CSI-RS configuration. Aperiodic CSI-RS is configured and
triggered/activated as described in Clause 8.5.1.2.

Table 8.5.1.1-1 Triggering/Activation of CSI reporting for the possible
CSI-RS Configurations.

  **CSI-RS Configuration**   **Aperiodic CSI Reporting**
  -------------------------- -----------------------------
  Aperiodic CSI-RS           Triggered by SCI.

For CSI reporting, wideband CQI reporting is supported. A wideband CQI
is reported for a single codeword for the entire CSI reporting band.

#### 8.5.1.2 Triggering of sidelink CSI reports

The CSI-triggering UE is not allowed to trigger another aperiodic CSI
report for the same UE before the last slot of the expected reception or
completion of the ongoing aperiodic CSI report associated with the SCI
format 2-A with the \'*CSI request*\' field set to 1, where the last
slot of the expected reception of the ongoing aperiodic CSI report is
given by \[10, TS38.321\].

An aperiodic CSI report is triggered by an SCI format 2-A with the
\'*CSI request*\' field set to 1.

A UE is not expected to transmit a sidelink CSI-RS and a sidelink PT-RS
which overlap.

### 8.5.2 Channel state information

#### 8.5.2.1 CSI reporting quantities

##### 8.5.2.1.1 Channel quality indicator (CQI)

The UE shall derive CQI as specified in clause 5.2.2.1, with the
following changes

\- PDSCH replaced by PSSCH

\- uplink slot replaced by sidelink slot

\- downlink physical resource blocks replaced by sidelink physical
resource blocks

\- Transport Block Size determination according to Clause 8.1.3.2

\- CSI reference resource according to the Clause 8.5.2.3

\- interference measurements are not supported

\- sub-band differential CQI is not supported

\- cqi-Table is determined as follows

\- cqi-Table = \'table1\' if Table 5.1.3.1-1 is determined as the MCS
table according to Clause 8.1.3.1 of \[6, 38.214\],

\- cqi-Table = \'table2\' if Table 5.1.3.1-2 is determined as the MCS
table according to Clause 8.1.3.1 of \[6, 38.214\],

\- cqi-Table = \'table3\' if Table 5.1.3.1-3 is determined as the MCS
table according to Clause 8.1.3.1 of \[6, 38.214\]

#### 8.5.2.2 Reference signal (CSI-RS)

The UE can be configured with one CSI-RS pattern as indicated by the
higher layer parameters *sl-CSI-RS-FreqAllocation,
sl-CSI-RS-FirstSymbol* in *SL-CSI-RS-Config*.

Parameters for which the UE shall assume non-zero transmission power for
CSI-RS are configured according to clause 8.2.1.

A UE is not expected to be configured such that a CSI-RS and the
corresponding PSCCH can be mapped to the same resource element. A UE is
not expected to receive sidelink CSI-RS and PSSCH DM-RS, nor CSI-RS and
2nd-stage SCI, on the same symbol.

Sidelink CSI-RS shall be transmitted according to \[4, TS 38.211\] in
the resource blocks used for the PSSCH associated with the SCI format
2-A triggering a report.

#### 8.5.2.3 CSI reference resource definition

The CSI reference resource in sidelink is defined as follows:

\- In the frequency domain, the CSI reference resource is defined by the
group of sidelink physical resource blocks containing the sidelink
CSI-RS to which the derived CSI relates.

\- In the time domain, the CSI reference resource for a CSI reporting in
sidelink slot *n* is defined by a single sidelink slot *n~CSI\_ref~*
where *n~CSI\_ref~* is the same sidelink slot as the corresponding CSI
request.

If configured to report CQI index and RI index, in the CSI reference
resource, the UE shall assume the following for the purpose of deriving
the CQI index and RI index:

\- The reference resource uses the CP length and subcarrier spacing
configured for the SL BWP.

\- Redundancy Version 0.

\- PSCCH occupies 2 OFDM symbols.

\- The number of PSSCH and DM-RS symbols is equal to
*sl-LengthSymbols*‒2.

\- Assume no REs allocated for sidelink CSI-RS.

\- Assume no REs allocated SCI format 2-A or SCI format 2-B.

\- Assume the same number of DM-RS symbols as the smallest one
configured by the higher layer parameter
*sl-PSSCH-DMRS-TimePatternList.*

\- Assume no REs allocated for sidelink PT-RS.

\- Assume sidelink CSI-RS RE power is the same as PSSCH RE power.

\- The PSSCH transmission scheme where the UE may assume that PSSCH
transmission would be performed with up to 2 transmission layers as
defined in Clause 8.3.1.4 of \[4, TS 38.211\]. For CQI calculation, the
UE should assume that PSSCH signals on antenna ports in the set
\[1000,..., 1000+ν-1\] for ν layers would result in signals equivalent
to corresponding symbols transmitted on antenna ports \[3000,...,
3000+*P*-1\], as given by

$\begin{bmatrix}
y^{\left( 3000 \right)}(i) \\
\cdots \\
y^{\left( 3000 + P - 1 \right)}(i) \\
\end{bmatrix} = W(i)\begin{bmatrix}
x^{\left( 0 \right)}(i) \\
\cdots \\
x^{\left( \nu - 1 \right)}(i) \\
\end{bmatrix}$

> where is a vector of PSSCH symbols from the layer mapping defined in
> Clause 8.3.1.4 of \[4, TS 38.211\],
> $P \in \left\lbrack 1,2 \right\rbrack$ is the number of CSI-RS ports.
> If only one CSI-RS port is configured, *W(i)* is 1. Otherwise, *W(i)*
> is the identity matrix*.*

### 8.5.3 CSI reporting

The UE can be configured with one CSI reporting latency bound as
indicated by the higher layer parameter *sl-LatencyBoundCSI-Report*. CSI
reporting is aperiodic and is described in \[10, TS 38.321\].

8.6 UE PSSCH preparation procedure time
---------------------------------------

For sidelink dynamic grant and for SL configured grant type 2
activation, if the first sidelink symbol in the sidelink allocation for
a PSSCH for a transport block and the associated PSCCH, including the
DM-RS and the duplicated symbol, as defined by the slot offset
$K_{\text{SL}}$ of the scheduling DCI for dynamic grant or the
activating DCI for SL configured grant type 2, is no earlier than at
symbol *L*, where *L* is defined as the next sidelink symbol with its CP
starting
$T_{\text{proc}} = (N_{2} + d_{2,1})(2048 + 144) \cdot \kappa 2^{- \mu} \cdot T_{C}$
after the end of the reception of the last symbol of the PDCCH carrying
the DCI scheduling the sidelink transmissions for dynamic grant or
activating the SL configured grant type 2, then the UE shall transmit
the PSSCH and the associated PSCCH.

*- N~2~* is based on *µ* of Table 8.6-1, where *µ* corresponds to the
one of (*µ~DL~*, *µ~SL~*) resulting with the largest *T~proc~*, where
the *µ~DL~* corresponds to the subcarrier spacing of the downlink with
which the PDCCH carrying the DCI scheduling the PSSCH for dynamic grant
or activating the SL configured grant type 2 was transmitted and *µ~SL~*
corresponds to the subcarrier spacing of the sidelink channel with which
the PSSCH and the associated PSCCH are to be transmitted, and *κ* is
defined in Clause 4.1 of \[4, TS 38.211\].

\- *d~2,1\ ~*= 1.

Otherwise the UE may ignore the scheduling DCI for dynamic grant or the
activating DCI for SL configured grant type 2.

The value of $T_{\text{proc}}$ is used both in the case of normal and
extended cyclic prefix.

For sidelink resource allocation mode 1, the UE does not expect that the
first sidelink symbol in the sidelink allocation for a PSSCH for
retransmission of a transport block and the associated PSCCH, including
the DM-RS and the duplicated symbol as defined by the \"Time resource
assignment\" field of the corresponding DCI for dynamic grant or for SL
configured grant type 2, or by *sl-TimeResourceCG-Type1* for configured
grant type 1 starts earlier than at symbol $L$ where $L$ is defined as
the next sidelink symbol with its CP starting $T_{\text{prep}} + \delta$
after the end of the last symbol of the PSFCH occasion corresponding to
the most recent transmission of PSSCH for the same transport block,
where $T_{\text{prep}}$ is defined in Clause 16.5 of \[6, TS 38.213\]
and $\delta = {5 \bullet 10}^{- 4}\text{\ s}$. Otherwise the UE may skip
the retransmission of the PSSCH and the transmission of the
corresponding PSCCH.
