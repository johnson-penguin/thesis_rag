 1 Scope
=======

The objective of this study is to define the over the air (OTA) testing
methodology for UE RF, UE RRM, and UE demodulation requirements for New
Radio, the associated measurement uncertainty budget(s), and the related
test tolerances.

The testing methodology development targets frequencies in FR2, and the
work is prioritized according to the frequency ranges that are included
in the NR work item.

For mmWave NR UEs, RF requirements are specified as OTA requirements,
using the applicable metrics. The definitions of these requirements are
expected to align the spatial coverage of the requirement with the UE\'s
working condition acceptable in expected directions. NR is expected to
be used in more than one type of UEs, and different spatial coverage
requirements may apply to different UE types.

different UE antenna design assumptions and have different UE maximum
output power and reference sensitivity requirements.

The test methods defined in this document are introduced for handheld
UEs and applicable to FR2 UE Power Class 3 unless otherwise stated. The
test methods can be applicable for other device types such as FWA,
tablets, vehicle mounted UE etc. in case they comply with UE power class
3 requirements.

The test methods can be further extended to other FR2 UE power classes
(i.e. UE power classes 1, 2 and 4). At least the following test methods
components are specific to different FR2 UE power classes and shall be
adjusted:

\- Measurement grids used for the UE RF Tx and Rx measurements.

\- Noise power level (Noc) and feasible SNR range for UE demodulation
and RRM test methodologies.

4.2 Testing configuration
-------------------------

The free space (FS) testing configuration is utilized in this study.

4.3 Test interface
------------------

A Test Interface (TI) is needed for certain control and measurement
functions. Detailed functions and implementation of the TI are as
follows:

\- All UEs supporting NR and operating in frequency range 2 (FR2) shall
support the following:

\- A mandatory UE beam lock function (UBF) to simplify the test method
complexity, such that

\- The UBF can disable changes to the UE beamforming configuration when
in NR\_RRC\_CONNECTED state

\- The measurement and reporting of synchronization signals reference
signal received power per branch (SS-RSRPB) \[14\], such that

\- These reporting requirements apply to all FR2 UEs in the context of a
test loop

\- The signalling associated with reporting SS-RSRPB is in a format
which allows the UE to report a vector of values, where the number of
the reported values equals to the number of receiver branches on the UE

\- Additional TI functionality is not precluded

4.4 Equivalence criteria
------------------------

The following 11 points have been agreed as a framework for developing
OTA test to prove equivalence.

> 1\) Multiple test methods may exist for each requirement.
>
> 2\) Each test method will require its own test procedure.
>
> 3\) A single conformance requirement applies for each core
> requirement, regardless of test procedure.
>
> 4\) Common maximum accepted test system uncertainty applies for all

NOTE: Potential dynamic range limitations, measurement uncertainties and
detailed test procedures are to be considered within UE conformance test
aspects for 5G System with NR and LTE (Work Item
5GS\_NR\_LTE-UEConTest).

The linking of core requirements via test methods to conformance
requirements is depicted in Figure 4.4-1.

5 UE RF testing methodology
===========================

5.1 General
-----------

It is reasonable to expect a high level of integration of high-frequency
NR devices (e.g., devices operating in FR2). Such highly integrated
architectures may feature innovative front-end solutions, multi-element
antenna arrays, passive and active feeding networks, etc. that may not
be able to physically expose a front-end cable connector to the test
equipment.

For UE RF test methodology in FR2, the following general aspects apply:

\- OTA measurement is the testing methodology for UE RF in FR2

\- Permitted test methods are defined in clause 5.2 and shall
demonstrate equivalence to the far field environment.

5.2 Permitted test methods
--------------------------

A permitted test method meets the equivalence criteria to the far field
environment by having an MU less than or equal to the threshold MU for
at least one test case. The applicability of methods is described in
clause 5.3.

### 5.2.1 Direct far field (DFF)

#### 5.2.1.1 Description

The DFF measurement setup of UE RF characteristics in FR2 is capable of
centre and off centre of beam measurements and is shown in Figure
5.2.1.1-1 below.

![](media/image4.emf){width="3.0in" height="2.2847222222222223in"}

Figure 5.2.1.1-1: DFF measurement setup of UE RF characteristics

The key aspects of the DFF setup are:

\- Far-field measurement system in an anechoic chamber

\- The criterion for determining the far-field distance is described in
5.2.1.2

\- A positioning system such that the angle between the dual-polarized
measurement antenna and the DUT has at least two axes of freedom and
maintains a polarization reference.

\- A positioning system such that the angle between the link antenna and
the DUT has at least two axes of freedom and maintains a polarization
reference; this positioning system for the link antenna is in addition
to the positioning system for the measurement antenna and provides for
an angular relationship independently controllable from the measurement
antenna.

\- **For setups intended for measurements of UE RF characteristics in
non-standalone (NSA) mode with 1 UL configuration, an LTE link antenna
is used to provide the LTE link to the DUT.** The LTE link antenna
provides a stable LTE signal without precise path loss or polarization
control.

\- **For setups intended for measurements in NR CA mode with FR1 and FR2
inter-band NR CA, test setup provides NR FR1 link to the DUT.** The NR
FR1 link has a stable and noise-free signal without precise path loss or
polarization control.

The applicability criteria of the DFF setup are:

\- The DUT radiating aperture is D ≤ 5 cm

\- Either a single radiating aperture, multiple non-coherent apertures
or multiple coherent apertures DUTs can be tested

\- If multiple antenna panels that are phase coherent are defined as a
single array, the criterion on DUT radiating aperture applies to this
single array

\- D is based on the MU assessment in Annex B.1.1.3

\- The measurement distance larger than the far-field criteria defined
in clause 5.2.1.2 is not precluded

\- If the uncertainties can be further optimized, the MU may be reduced
or D may be increased

\- A manufacturer declaration on the following elements is needed:

\- Manufacturer declares antenna array size

\- EIRP, TRP, EIS, EVM, spurious emissions and blocking metrics can be
tested.

#### 5.2.1.2 Far-field criteria

The minimum far-field distance R for a traditional far field anechoic
chamber can be calculated based on the following equation: , where D is
the diameter of the smallest sphere that encloses the radiating parts of
the DUT. The near/far field boundary for different antenna sizes and
frequencies is shown in Table 5.2.1.2-1.

Table 5.2.1.2-1: Near field/far field boundary for different frequencies
and antenna sizes for a traditional far field anechoic chamber

  D(cm)   Frequency (GHz)   Near/far boundary (cm)   Path Loss (dB)   Frequency (GHz)   Near/far boundary (cm)   Path Loss (dB)
  ------- ----------------- ------------------------ ---------------- ----------------- ------------------------ ----------------
  5       28                47                       54.8             100               167                      76.9
  10      28                187                      66.8             100               667                      88.9
  15      28                420                      73.9             100               1501                     96
  20      28                747                      78.9             100               2668                     101
  25      28                1167                     82.7             100               4169                     105
  30      28                1681                     85.9             100               6004                     108

As can be seen in the table, the distance can be very large for larger
antenna sizes and higher frequencies. This could lead to very large
chambers that would be prohibitively expensive.

Generally, the exact antenna size of the DUT is unknown since the device
will be in its own casing during the test and this also depends on other
factors such as ground coupling effects that depend on the design. The
largest device size (e.g. diagonal) could be used; however, this would
lead to very large chambers even for relatively small devices. A
practical way to determine the far field distance is needed.

It has been proposed to determine the testing distance based on a
manufacturer declaration. One of the risks of this approach is that a
distance shorter than the actual far field is chose. It should be
further studied whether this could lead to underperforming devices
passing the tests due to measurement inaccuracies (e.g. whether a
shorter distance will lead to better measurement results than the actual
far field distance).

Additionally, an experimental method was proposed to determine the far
field distance based on path loss measurements. This method is based on
the fact that the path loss exponent is different in the near field and
the far field. By measuring the path loss gradient over a certain
distance, the near/far field boundary could be found. The results of an
experiment conducted on a Band 3 LTE device are shown in Figure
5.2.1.2-1. The minimum far field distance can be found at the regression
intercept point.

![](media/image6.emf){width="4.0in" height="2.6041666666666665in"}

Figure 5.2.1.2-1: LTE UE FDD band 3 measurements to determine the
minimum far-field distance

The figure shows an example result for the case where the frequency is
1.85 GHz. The approximate device dimensions were 13 x 8 cm. Under these
conditions, the canonical minimum far-field distance would be 28.7 cm.
According to this method, the minimum measurement distance would be 13.8
cm. Further work is required to determine whether this technique
provides valid results for much higher frequencies and general device
types.

Methods to reduce measurement distance for AAS BS are Compact Antenna
Test Range, One Dimensional Compact Range, and Near Field Test Range
which are all listed in TR 37.842 \[9\]. These may be used for NR
provided they meet the equivalence criteria relative to the baseline
measurement setup. Other methods are not precluded.

The minimum range length of a DFF system, i.e., the minimum distance
between the centre of the quiet zone and the measurement antenna, needs
to take into account the unknown offset of the antenna aperture from the
centre of quiet zone in order to guarantee far-field conditions for any
antenna array integrated inside the DUT. The distance between the centre
of the quiet zone to the measurement antenna is referenced as R~DFF~,
while the radius of the quiet zone is R~QZ~ as illustrated in Figure
5.2.1.2-2. The minimum distance between the antenna array integrated
anywhere within the DUT and the measurement antenna needs to meet the
far-field distance, R~FF~ = 2D^2^/λ.

height="2.9305555555555554in"}

Figure 5.2.1.2-2: Illustration of DFF System for range length definition

The setup in Figure 5.2.1.2-3 is used to derive the minimum range length
for NR FR2 DFF systems where the sphere enclosing the DUT matches the QZ
and the DUT antenna with radiating aperture diameter D located in the
corner of the DUT. With this setup, the minimum range length, R~DFF~,
can be determined as

R~DFF~ = R~QZ~ -- D/2 + R~FF~ = R~QZ~ -- D/2 + 2D^2^/λ

which is tabulated in Table 5.2.1.2-1 for two different QZ sizes
assuming D=5cm.

#### 5.2.1.3 Testing and calibration aspects

##### 5.2.1.3.1 Calibration Measurement Procedure

The calibration measurement is done by using a reference calibration
antenna with known gain values. For the calibration measurement, the
reference antenna is placed in the centre of the quiet zone. If an
antenna with moving phase centre is used, a multi-segmented approach
could be chosen where for multiple frequency segments the respective
phase centre of the calibration antenna is placed in the centre of quiet
zone. The calibration process determines the composite loss,
L~path,pol~, of the entire transmission and receiver chain path gains
(measurement antenna, amplification) and losses (switches, combiners,
cables, path loss, etc.). The calibration measurement is repeated for
each measurement path (two orthogonal polarizations and each signal
path). Additional details of the calibration procedure are outlined in
\[13\].

##### 5.2.1.3.2 Peak EIRP Measurement Procedure

from Tables C.2-1 through C.2-3 if the maximum beam peak direction is
within zenith angular range 90^o^\< θ ≤180^o^ for DUT Orientation 1 for
the alignment option selected in step 1.

3\) Connect the SS (System Simulator) with the DUT through the
measurement antenna with polarization reference Pol~Link~ to form the TX
beam towards the TX beam peak direction and respective polarization.

4\) Lock the beam toward that direction for the entire duration of the
test and send continuously power control \"up\" commands in every uplink
scheduling information to the UE.

5\) Measure the mean power P~meas~ (Pol~Meas~=θ, Pol~Link~) of the
modulated signal arriving at the power measurement equipment (such as a
spectrum analyser, power meter, or gNB emulator).

of the entire transmission path for utilized signal path, L~EIRP,θ~, and
frequency to the measured power P~meas~ (Pol~Meas~=θ, Pol~Link~).

7\) Measure the mean power P~meas~ (Pol~Meas~=φ, Pol~Link~) of the
modulated signal arriving at the power measurement equipment.

commands in every uplink scheduling information to the UE.

5\) For each measurement point, measure P~meas~(Pol~Meas~=θ, Pol~Link~)
and P~meas~(Pol~Meas~=φ, Pol~Link~). The angle between the measurement
antenna and the DUT (θ~Meas~, ϕ~Meas~) is achieved by rotating the
measurement antenna and the DUT (based on system architecture).

6\) Calculate EIRP(Pol~Meas~=θ, Pol~Link~) and EIRP(Pol~Meas~=φ,
Pol~Link~) by adding the composite loss of the entire transmission path

##### 5.2.1.3.7 TX Beam Peak direction search and EIRP Spherical Coverage

The beam peak search and spherical coverage test procedure apply to DUTs
with different beam correspondence capability, as defined in TS 38.306
\[19\]. For the purpose of DUT refining TX beam with beam correspondence
capability, the System Simulator shall assure the presence of downlink
reference signals including both SSB and CSI-RS and Type D QCL shall be
maintained between SSB and CSI-RS.

The TX beam peak direction is found with a 3D EIRP scan (separately for
each orthogonal downlink polarization). The TX beam peak direction
search grid points for this single grid approach are defined in Annex
G.2. Alternatively, a coarse and fine grid approach could be used
according to the definition in Annex G.2.4.

The measurement procedure includes the following steps for each of the
points in the grid:

1\) Select any of the three Alignment Options (1, 2, or 3) from Tables
C.2-1 through C.2-3 to mount the DUT inside the QZ.

2\) Position the DUT in DUT Orientation 1 from Tables C.2-1 through
C.2-3.

3\) Connect the SS (System Simulator) with the DUT through the
measurement antenna with Pol~Link~=θ to form the TX beam towards the
measurement antenna.

4\) DUT refines its TX beam toward that direction depending on DUT's
beam correspondence capability which shall match OEM declaration:

if DUT's beam correspondence capability is \[bit-1\], then DUT
autonomously chooses the corresponding TX beam for PUSCH transmission
using downlink reference signals to transmit in the direction of the
incoming DL signal, which is based on beam correspondence without
relying on UL beam sweeping

if DUT's beam correspondence capability is \[bit-0\], then DUT chooses
the TX beam for PUSCH transmission which is based on beam correspondence
that relies on both DL measurements on downlink reference signals and
network-assisted uplink beam sweeping.

5\) Lock the beam and send continuously power control \"up\" commands in
every uplink scheduling information to the UE

6\) Measure the mean power P~meas~(Pol~Meas~=θ, Pol~Link~=θ) of the
modulated signal arriving at the power measurement equipment (such as a
spectrum analyser, power meter, or gNB emulator).

7\) Calculate EIRP (Pol~Meas~=θ,Pol~Link~=θ) by adding the composite
loss of the entire transmission path for utilized signal path,
L~EIRP,θ~, and frequency to the measured power
P~meas~(Pol~Meas~=θ,Pol~Link~=θ)

8\) Measure the mean power P~meas~ (Pol~Meas~=φ,Pol~Link~=θ) of the
modulated signal arriving at the power measurement equipment.

9\) Calculate EIRP (Pol~Meas~=φ,Pol~Link~=θ) by adding the composite
losses of the entire transmission path for utilized signal path,
L~EIRP,ϕ~, and frequency to the measured power P~meas~
(Pol~Meas~=φ,Pol~Link~=θ)

10\) Calculate total EIRP(Pol~Link~=θ) = EIRP(Pol~Meas~=θ,Pol~Link~=θ) +
EIRP(Pol~Meas~=φ,Pol~Link~=θ)

11\) Unlock the beam.

12\) Connect the SS (System Simulator) with the DUT through the
measurement antenna with Pol~Link~=φ polarization to form the TX beam
towards the measurement antenna.

13\) Repeat steps 4) to 12).

14\) Advance to the next grid point and repeat steps 3 through 13 until
measurements within zenith range 0^o^≤ θ ≤90^o^ have been completed

15\) After the measurements within zenith range 0^o^≤ θ ≤90^o^ have been
completed and

a\) if the re-positioning concept is applied to the TX test cases,
position the device in DUT Orientation 2 (either Options 1 or 2) from
Tables C.2-1 through C.2-3 for the Alignment Option selected in Step 1.
For the TX beam peak search in the second hemisphere, perform steps 3
through 14 for the range of zenith angles 90^o^\< θ ≤0^o^.

b\) if the re-positioning concept is not applied to the TX test cases,
continue steps 3 through 13 for the range of zenith angles
90^o^\< θ ≤180^o^

For beam correspondence capability \[bit-0\] DUT, the above step 4) can
be further clarified as following sub-steps:

4.1) DUT uses downlink reference signals to select proper RX beam and
uses autonomous beam correspondence to select the TX beam.

4.2) SS configures M=8 SRS resources to DUT, with the field
*spatialRelationInfo* omitted and the field *usage* set as
'beamManagement'. In case DUT supports less than 8 SRS resources, SS
configures the number of SRS resources according to the maximum number
of SRS resources indicated by UE capability signalling. Additionally,
for codebook based PUSCH transmission, SS configures a semi-persistent
SRS resource set with the field *usage* as 'codebook'.

4.3) Based on the TX beam autonomously selected by DUT, DUT chooses TX
beams to transmit SRS-resources configured by SS.

4.4) Based on measurement of the received *beamManagement* SRS, SS
chooses the best SRS beam beam and, if needed, updates the spatial
relation information between the semi-persistent *codebook* SRS
resources and the SS selected *beamManagement* SRS resource in the
activation MAC CE of the semi-persistent SRS resource. The SS indicates
in the SRS Resource Indicator (SRI) field in the scheduling grant for
PUSCH, if present, the SRS resource within the semi-persistent SRS
resource set whose spatial relation is linked to the best detected SRS
beam.

4.5) DUT transmits PUSCH corresponding to the SRS resource indicated by
the SRI.

The TX beam peak direction is where the maximum total component of
EIRP(Pol~Link~=θ) or EIRP(Pol~Link~=φ) is found.

The EIRP results from the TX beam peak search using the minimum number
of grid points as described in Annex G.2 can be re-used for EIRP
spherical coverage. In case a **coarse beam peak grid is used for TX
beam peak search, using the minimum number of grid points defined in
Annex G.3.3.2.3, the EIRP results can be re-used for EIRP spherical
coverage.**

In case a separate test is performed for EIRP spherical coverage, the
procedure above shall be followed using the minimum number of grid
points defined in Annex G.3.3.2.3 for spherical coverage.

The EIRP~target-CDF~ is then obtained from the Cumulative Distribution
Function (CDF) computed using maximum(EIRP(Pol~Link~=θ),
EIRP(Pol~Link~=φ)) for all grid points. When using constant step size
measurement grids, a theta-dependent correction shall be applied, i.e.,
the PDF probability contribution for each measurement point is scaled by
sin(θ).

##### 5.2.1.3.8 RX Beam Peak direction search and EIS Spherical Coverage

The RX beam peak direction is found with a 3D EIS scan (separately for
each orthogonal downlink polarization). The RX beam peak direction
search grid points for this single grid approach are defined in Annex
G.2. Alternatively, a coarse and fine grid approach could be used
according to the definition in Annex G.2.4.

The measurement procedure includes the following steps for each of the
points in the grid:

1\) Select any of the three Alignment Options (1, 2, or 3) from Tables
C.2-1 through C.2-3 to mount the DUT inside the QZ.

2\) Position the DUT in DUT Orientation 1 from Tables C.2-1 through
C.2-3.

3\) Establish a connection between the DUT and the SS with the downlink
signal applied to the Pol~Link~=θ-polarization of the measurement
antenna

4\) Position the UE so that the beam is formed towards the measurement
antenna in the desired RX beam direction.

5\) Determine EIS (Pol~Meas~=θ, Pol~Link~=θ) for θ-polarization, i.e.,
the power level for the θ-polarization at which the throughput exceeds
the requirements for the specified reference measurement channel

6\) Switch the downlink to the Pol~Link~=ϕ-polarization of the
measurement antenna

7\) Determine EIS(Pol~Meas~=φ, Pol~Link~=φ) for ϕ-polarization, i.e.,
the power level for the ϕ-polarization at which the throughput exceeds
the requirements for the specified reference measurement channel

8\) Advance to the next grid point and repeat steps 3 through 7 until
measurements within zenith range 0^o^≤θ≤90^o^ have been completed

9\) After the measurements within zenith range 0^o^≤ θ ≤90^o^ have been
completed and

a\) if the re-positioning concept is applied to the RX test cases,
position the device in DUT Orientation 2 (either Options 1 or 2) from
Tables C.2-1 through C.2-3 for the Alignment Option selected in Step 1.
For the RX beam peak search in the second hemisphere, perform steps 3
through 8 for the range of zenith angles 90^o^\< θ ≤0^o^

b\) if the re-positioning concept is not applied to the RX test cases,
continue steps 3 through 8 for the range of zenith angles
90^o^\< θ ≤180^o^

> 10\) Calculate the resulting averaged EIS as:

EIS = 2\*\[1/EIS(Pol~Meas~=θ, Pol~Link~=θ) +1/EIS(Pol~Meas~=φ,
Pol~Link~=φ)\]^-1^

The RX beam peak direction is where the minimum EIS is found.

The EIS results from the RX beam peak search using the minimum number of
grid points as described in Annex G.2 can be re-used for EIS spherical
coverage. In case a **coarse beam peak grid is used for RX beam peak
search with an EIS metric, using the minimum number of grid points
defined in Annex G.3.3.2.3, the EIS results can be re-used for EIS
spherical coverage.** In case a separate test is performed for spherical
coverage, the procedure above should be followed using the minimum
number of grid points defined in Annex G.3.3.2.3 for spherical coverage.

The EIS~target-CDF~ is then obtained from the Cumulative Distribution
Function (CDF) computed using total EIS for all grid points. When using
constant step size measurement grids, a theta-dependent correction shall
be applied, i.e., the PDF probability contribution for each measurement
point is scaled by sin(θ).

##### 5.2.1.3.9 Beam Correspondence Tolerance

The beam correspondence requirement is fulfilled if the DUT satisfies
one of the following conditions, depending on the beam correspondence
capability, as defined in TS38.306 \[19\]:

\- If \[bit-1\], the DUT shall meet the minimum peak EIRP requirement
and spherical coverage requirement with its autonomously chosen UL beams
and without uplink beam sweeping. Such a DUT is considered to have met
the beam correspondence tolerance requirement.

\- If \[bit-0\], the DUT shall meet the minimum peak EIRP requirement
and spherical coverage requirement with uplink beam sweeping. Such a DUT
shall meet the beam correspondence tolerance requirement and shall
support uplink beam management, as defined in TS 38.306 \[19\].

Thus, the beam correspondence tolerance test is only applicable to the
DUT that has beam correspondence capability as \[bit-0\] (which shall
match OEM declaration), such that DUT relies on uplink beam sweeping to
fulfil the minimum peak EIRP and spherical coverage requirements.

ΔEIRP~BC~ is introduced for beam correspondence tolerance based on two
EIRP measurements (EIRP~1~ and EIRP~2~). EIRP~1~ is the measured total
EIRP based on the beam which DUT chooses autonomously (corresponding
beam) to transmit in the direction of the incoming DL signal, which is
based on beam correspondence without relying on UL beam sweeping.
EIRP~2~ is the measured total EIRP based on the beam yielding highest
EIRP in a given direction, which is based on beam correspondence with
relying on UL beam sweeping. ΔEIRP~BC~ shall be calculated over the link
angles spanning a subset of the spherical coverage grid points which are
corresponding to the top N^th^ percentile of the EIRP~2~ measurement
points in the grid, where the value of N is according to EIRP spherical
coverage requirement of DUT's power class defined in TS 38.101-2 \[16\]
clause 6.2.1, e.g., N=50 for power class 3 DUT.

For each of the points in the grid:

1\) Follow the test procedures specified in clause 5.2.1.3.7 with uplink
beam sweeping disabled, obtain total EIRP~1~(Pol~Link~=θ) and total
EIRP~1~(Pol~Link~=φ). EIRP~1~ is calculated by EIRP~1~ =
maximum(EIRP~1~(Pol~Link~=θ), EIRP~1~(Pol~Link~=φ)).

2\) Follow the test procedures specified in clause 5.2.1.3.7, with
uplink beam sweeping enabled (SS does not configure the
*spatialRelationInfo* to DUT) during DUT TX beam refinement, obtain
total EIRP~2~(Pol~Link~=θ) and total EIRP~2~(Pol~Link~=φ). EIRP~2~ is
calculated by EIRP~2~ = maximum(EIRP~2~(Pol~Link~=θ),
EIRP~2~(Pol~Link~=φ)).

3\) Calculate the ΔEIRP~BC~ = EIRP~2~ -- EIRP~1~.

The ΔEIRP~target-CDF~ is then obtained from the Cumulative Distribution
Function (CDF) computed using ΔEIRP~BC~ for each of all top N^th^
percentile of the EIRP~2~ measurement points in the grid. When using
constant step size measurement grids, a theta-dependent correction shall
be applied, i.e., the PDF probability contribution for each measurement
point is scaled by sin(θ).

*Editor's Note: The side conditions for downlink reference signals SSB
and CSI-RS in beam correspondence tolerance test are FFS.*

### 5.2.2 Direct far field (DFF) setup simplification for centre of beam measurements

#### 5.2.2.1 Description

The DFF setup in 5.2.1 can be simplified in the following way to perform
centre of the beam measurements:

\- The measurement and the link antenna can be combined so that the
single antenna is used to steer the beam and to perform UE RF
measurements.

The measurement setup of UE RF characteristics in FR2 capable of centre
of beam measurements is shown in Figure 5.2.1.1-1 below.

![](media/image9.emf){width="3.0in" height="2.3680555555555554in"}

Figure 5.2.2.1-1: Centre of beam measurement setup of UE RF
characteristics

The applicability criteria of the simplified DFF setup for centre of
beam measurements are defined in 5.2.1.1.

#### 5.2.2.2 Far-field criteria

The far-field criteria of the simplified DFF setup for centre of beam
measurements are defined in 5.2.1.2.

#### 5.2.2.3 Testing and calibration aspects

The same testing and calibration aspects apply as outlined in 5.2.1.3.

### 5.2.3 Indirect far field (IFF) method 1

The IFF method 1 creates the far field environment using a
transformation with a parabolic reflector. This is also known as the
compact antenna test range (CATR). Refer to Annex E for additional
information.

#### 5.2.3.1 Description

The IFF measurement setup of UE RF characteristics for FR2 is capable of
centre and off centre of beam measurements and is shown in Figure
5.2.3.1-1 below.

![](media/image10.png){width="5.5in" height="5.188888888888889in"}

Figure 5.2.3.1-1: IFF method 1 (CATR) measurement setup of UE RF
characteristic

The key aspects of this test method setup are:

\- Indirect Far field of Compact Antenna Test Range as the one used in
\[9\] with quiet zone diameter at least D.

\- A positioning system such that the angle between the dual-polarized
measurement antenna and the DUT has at least two axes of freedom and
maintains a polarization reference.

\- Before performing the UBF, the measurement probe acts as a link
antenna maintaining polarization reference with respect to the DUT. Once
the beam is locked then the link is to be passed to the link antenna
which maintains reliable signal level with respect to the DUT.

\- For setups intended for measurements of UE RF characteristics in
non-standalone (NSA) mode with 1UL configuration, an LTE link antenna is
used to provide the LTE link to the DUT. The LTE link antenna provides a
stable LTE signal without precise path loss or polarization control.

\- **For setups intended for measurements in NR CA mode with FR1 and FR2
inter-band NR CA, test setup provides NR FR1 link to the DUT.** The NR
FR1 link has a stable and noise-free signal without precise path loss or
polarization control.

The applicability criteria of this test method are:

\- The total test volume is a cylinder with diameter d and height h.

\- DUT must fit within the total test volume for the entire duration of
the test.

\- Either a single radiating aperture, multiple non-coherent apertures
or multiple coherent apertures DUTs can be tested.

\- EIRP, TRP, EIS, EVM, spurious emissions and blocking metrics can be
tested.

\- No manufacturer declaration is needed.

#### 5.2.3.2 Far-field criteria

The CATR system does not require a measurement distance of to achieve a
plane wave as in a standard far field range.

The Table 5.2.3.2-1 and Table 5.2.3.2-2 below show the paths losses
which can be expected for the CATR compared to a Fraunhofer limit
distance ().

  NOTE 1: Final values will depend on CATR specific implementation                     

For CATR, the FF distance is seen as the focal length, distance between
the feed and reflector for a CATR, which can be calculated as shown
below (as a rule of thumb although it can vary depending on system
implementation):

\- D =x \[m\]

\- size of reflector = 2\*D

\- R = focal length = 3.5\*size of reflector = 3.5\*(2\*D)

In a CATR, from the reflector to the quiet zone, there is a plane wave
with no space loss.

For both direct FF and CATR, free space path loss is calculated by
applying the Free Space Loss formula with R = FF distance:

#### 5.2.3.3 Testing and calibration aspects

##### 5.2.3.3.1 Calibration Measurement Procedure

The calibration measurement is done by using a reference antenna (SGH
used in Figure 5.2.3.3.1-1) with known efficiency or gain values. In the
calibration measurement the reference antenna is measured in the same
place as the DUT, and the attenuation of the complete transmission path
(C↔A, as in Figure 5.2.3.3.1-1) from the DUT to the measurement receiver
(EIRP), and from the RF source to DUT (EIS) is calibrated out. Figure
5.2.3.3.1-1 presents a setup of a typical compact antenna test range for
EIRP calibration:

centre and off centre of beam measurements and is shown in Figure
5.2.4.1-1:

Figure 5.2.4.1-1: Typical NFTF measurement setup of EIRP/TRP
measurements

The key aspects of the Near Field test range are:

\- Radiated Near Field UE beam pattern are measured and based on the
NFTF mathematical transform, the final metric such as EIRP is the same
as the metric for the baseline setup

\- A positioning system such as the angle between the dual-polarized
measurement/link antenna and the DUT has at least two axes of freedom
and maintains a polarization reference

\- For setups intended for measurements of UE RF characteristics in
non-standalone (NSA) mode with 1UL configuration, an LTE link antenna is
used to provide the LTE link to the DUT. The LTE link antenna provides a
stable LTE signal without precise path loss or polarization control.

\- For setups intended for measurements in NR CA mode with FR1 and FR2
inter-band NR CA, test setup provides NR FR1 link to the DUT. The NR FR1
link has a stable and noise-free signal without precise path loss or
polarization control.

The applicability criteria of the NFTF setup are:

\- The DUT radiating aperture is D ≤ 5 cm

\- Either a single radiating aperture, multiple non-coherent apertures
or multiple coherent apertures DUTs can be tested

\- If multiple antenna panels that are phase coherent are defined as a
single array, the criterion on DUT radiating aperture applies to this
single array

\- D is based on the MU assessment in Annex B.1.4.3

\- If the uncertainties can be further optimized, the MU may be reduced
or D may be increased

\- A manufacturer declaration on the following elements is needed:

\- Manufacturer declares antenna array size

\- EIRP, TRP, and spurious emissions metrics can be tested.

#### 5.2.4.2 Testing and calibration aspects

##### 5.2.4.2.1 Calibration Measurement Procedure

Calibration accounts for the various factors affecting the measurements
of the EIRP. These factors include components such as range length path
loss, cable losses, gain of the receiving antenna, etc. Each measured
data point for radiated power is transformed from a relative value in dB
to an absolute value in dBm. For doing that the total path loss from the
DUT to the measurement receiver, named L path loss is calibrated out.
The calibration measurement is usually done by using a reference antenna
with known gain. This approach is based on the so called gain-comparison
method. Figure 5.2.4.2-1 shows the typical configuration for measuring
path loss.

![Typical Path Loss Measurement configurationFigure

height="3.2291666666666665in"}

Figure 5.2.4.2-1: NFTF -- Typical setup for path loss measurement

The L path loss can be determined from the power into the reference
antenna by adding the gain of the reference antenna:

Piso = Pref + Gref

so that:

L path loss = Pref + Gref - Ptest

In order to determine Pref, a cable reference measurement is performed
in order to calibrate out the A, and B paths. Assuming that the power at
the source is fixed, it can be showed that:

Pref-Ptes=Prec\'-Prec

Where Prec and Prec\' are the power measured at the receiver during the
calibration measurement with the reference antenna and the power
measured at the receiver during the cable reference measurement
respectively. L path loss is then given by:

L path loss = Gref + Prec\' - Prec

##### 5.2.4.2.2 Peak EIRP Measurement Procedure

The TX beam peak direction is where the maximum total component of EIRP
is found, including the respective polarization of the measurement
antenna used to form the TX beam, according to 5.2.1.3.7.

The measurement procedure includes the following steps:

1\) Connect the SS (System Simulator) to the DUT through the measurement
antenna with polarization reference Pol~Meas~ to form the TX beam
towards the TX beam peak direction and respective polarization.

2\) Lock the beam toward that direction for the entire duration of the
test.

3\) Perform a 3D pattern measurement (amplitude and phase) with the DUT
sending a modulated signal.

4\) Determine the EIRP for both polarization towards the TX beam peak
direction by using a Near Field to Far Field transform.

5\) Calculate total EIRP = EIRP~θ~ + EIRP~φ~

##### 5.2.4.2.3 TRP Measurement Procedure

The minimum number of measurement points for TRP measurement grid is
outlined in Annex G.1.

The measurement procedure includes the following steps:

1\) Connect the SS to the DUT through the measurement antenna with
polarization reference Pol~Meas~ to form the TX beam towards the
previously determined TX beam peak direction and respective
polarization.

2\) Lock the beam toward that direction for the entire duration of the
test.

3\) Perform a 3D pattern measurement (amplitude and phase) with the DUT
sending a modulated signal.

4\) For each measurement point on the grid, determine the EIRP for both
polarization by using a Near Field to Far Field transform.

5\) The TRP value for the constant step size measurement grids are
calculated using the TRP integration approaches outlined in Annex G.1.2.
The TRP value for the constant density grid is calculated using the TRP
integration formula in Annex G.1.3.

5.3 Test method applicability
-----------------------------

The test methods in clause 5.2 are applicable to test cases based on
being less than or equal to a threshold MU.

The threshold MU for the equivalence framework will be based on direct
far field (DFF) test method for D ≤ 5 cm and for indirect far field
(IFF) test method for D \> 5 cm.

A permitted test method will have applicability to at least one test
case. Applicability is a function of DUT Antenna Configuration as
defined in Table 5.3-1 DUT Antenna Configuration can be chosen by an
optional declaration from a manufacturer.

Table 5.3-1: DUT Antenna Configuration

  2                           More than one antenna panel D ≤ 5 cm without phase coherence between panels active at any one time
  3                           Any phase coherent antenna panel of any size (e.g. sparse array)

+----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+

The detailed applicability of any test method for any test will be a
function of DUT Antenna Configuration, D, the actual testing distance
and the resulting calculated MU. If the calculated MU is lower than the
threshold MU, then that test method is applicable to the test.

6 UE RRM testing methodology
============================

6.1 General
-----------

Testability aspects of the UE have been considered. Unless otherwise
indicated below, device under test (DUT) refers to UE nodes. The exact
list of RRM tests for UE can only be determined once the core
requirements are settled.

For frequency bands in FR2 (e.g. mm-wave), conducted antenna connectors
are assumed not to be available at DUT and the OTA testing is considered
as the baseline approach for NR UE RRM testing methodology.

The possibility of performing conducted tests using an intermediate
frequency (IF) were evaluated. It was decided that this approach would
be challenging to standardise for various reasons since IF is an
internal interface in the DUT and using a standardised IF (signal level,
number of IF ports, IF frequency etc.) would preclude many different DUT
implementations including direct conversion receivers. In addition, IF
testing excludes all components which operate at the radio frequency
such as RF filters, duplexers, transmit receive switch, low noise
amplifier (LNA), power amplifier (PA), analogue beamforming phase
shifting elements etc., and the algorithms which control such components
from the test.

Further details of a suitable OTA test environment are to be discussed
in the work item, and may have impact to the core requirements which are
defined. For example, side conditions for the applicability of core
requirements should be defined in a way in which they can be ensured in
an OTA environment.

6.2 Measurement setup
---------------------

### 6.2.1 Baseline setup

#### 6.2.1.1 Description

The baseline measurement setup of UE RRM characteristics for frequency
bands in FR2 is capable of establishing an OTA link between the DUT and
a number of emulated gNB sources as shown in Figure 6.2.1.1-1.

![](media/image15.png){width="3.7444444444444445in"
height="3.7020833333333334in"}

Figure 6.2.1.1-1: Baseline measurement setup of RRM characteristics

The absolute position of the probes is left up to implementation. The
relative angular relationship between two AoAs can be achieved using any
combination of probes. The relative orientation of the coordinate system
is defined with respect to one probe, referred to as the reference probe
P0 along which the z-axis is defined. The test conditions in Annex C.2
and the positioning guidelines in C.3 apply to the RRM baseline setup.
The quality of quiet zone validation defined in Annex D only needs to be
performed with the reference probe P0 and only to assess the
single-directional EIRP and EIS metrics.

The UE RRM baseline measurement setup shall fulfil the following
capabilities:

\- The following permitted test setups are considered for OTA RRM
testing:

\- DFF test setup as described in Clause 5.

\- Simplified DFF test setup as described in Clause 5.

\- IFF test setup as described in Clause 5.

\- TRxPs and Cells:

\- Up to 2 NR transmission reception points TRxPs are emulated.

\- Support of interworking scenarios

\- For test scenarios involving both, LTE and NR FR2 carriers, the test
setup shall be capable to provide LTE link to the DUT. The emulated LTE
cell provides a stable LTE signal without precise propagation modelling
or path loss control between it and the DUT. No performance verification
for and relative to LTE carriers is supported.

\- For test scenarios involving both, NR FR1 and NR FR2 carriers, the
test setup shall be capable to provide NR FR1 link to the DUT. The NR
FR1 link has a stable and noise-free signal without precise path loss or
polarization control. No performance verification for and relative to NR
FR1 carriers is supported.

\- Antennas, polarization, simultaneously active AoAs:

\- N dual-polarized antennas transmitting the signals from the emulated
gNB sources to the DUT.

\- The antennas transmit into the test zone in such a way that signal
polarization does not prevent the DUT receiving a consistent,
predictable power level.

\- N ≥ N~MAX\_AoAs~, where N~MAX\_AoAs~ is the maximum number of
simultaneously active (emulating signal) angles of arrival AoAs.

\- For the scope of Rel-15 testing N~MAX\_AoAs~ = 2.

\- For UE RRM baseline measurement setup based on DFF, the supported
N~MAX\_AoAs~ = 2.

\- For UE RRM baseline measurement setup based on simplified DFF, the
supported N~MAX\_AoAs~ = 1.

\- For UE RRM baseline measurement setup based on IFF, the supported
N~MAX\_AoAs~ = 1.

\- Angular Relationship:

\- A positioning system such that an angular relationship with two axes
of freedom is provided between the DUT and the test system antennas (or
the setup should provide equivalent functionality).

\- For N~MAX\_AoAs~ = 2 the setup shall enable following relative
angular relationships between the N~MAX\_AoAs~ simultaneously active
AoAs: 30°, 60°, 90°, 120° and 150°.

\- For single active probe scenarios, in case that step change of AoA is
required, the setup shall enable following relative angular change
between initial and target AoA: 30°, 60°, 90°, 120° and 150°.

\- Wanted and noise (AWGN) signals can be transmitted from one or both
active probes. Test description will define the exact
signal/noise/SNR/SINR level per TRxP at the reference point.

\- Multiple DL transmission antenna ports:

\- In case of multiple DL transmission antenna ports are required for
RRM testing, the different antenna ports are mapped to different
polarizations.

\- Propagation Conditions

\- Test method shall allow modelling of the following propagation
conditions between the DUT and the emulated gNB sources

\- Multi-path fading propagation conditions

\- Multi-path fading propagation conditions between the DUT and the
emulated gNB sources are modelled as Single probe channel models as
described in clause 8.2.

\- The Single probe channel models for RRM testing adopts the same
framework of Demodulation. Detailed channel parameterization should be
defined in the NR WI performance part.

\- Static propagation conditions

\- Measurement Uncertainty:

\- For UE RRM baseline measurement setup based on DFF, it is likely that
the measurement uncertainty budget for the RRM setup may contain
additional measurement uncertainty elements relative to the setup
defined in clause 5.2.1. These have been defined in Annex B.2.1.

\- Applicability Criteria:

\- For UE RRM baseline measurement setup based on DFF, the applicability
criteria defined for the DFF UE RF test method described in clause 5.2.1
can be applied.

\- For UE RRM baseline measurement setup based on simplified DFF, the
applicability criteria defined for the DFF UE RF test method described
in clause 5.2.2 can be applied.

\- For UE RRM baseline measurement setup based on IFF, the applicability
criteria defined for the IFF UE RF test method described in clause 5.2.3
can be applied.

Note: Using UE Demodulation baseline setup in clause 7.2 to perform
selected RRM metrics testing is not precluded. Feasibility and
applicability of this condition should be investigated in the NR WI
performance part.

#### 6.2.1.2 Far-field criteria and Quiet Zone

For RRM baseline measurement setup based on DFF:

\- The Far-field criteria defined for the DFF UE RF test method
described in clause 5.2.1 can be applied.

\- A DFF measurement setup has the centre of the Quiet Zone (QZ) located
at the centre of the rotational axes (of DUT and measurement antenna).
For the RRM measurement baseline setup based on DFF, the vertices of the
N probes have to be aligned to the resulting centre of the QZ. The
centre of the QZ is taken as the reference point for MU definition for
each probe. The same QZ size as for DFF UE RF test method described in
clause 5.2.1 applies.

For RRM baseline measurement setup based on simplified DFF:

\- The Far-field criteria defined for the simplified DFF UE RF test
method described in clause 5.2.2 can be applied.

\- The same QZ size and definition as for simplified DFF UE RF test
method described in clause 5.2.2 applies.

For RRM baseline measurement setup based on IFF:

\- The Far-field criteria defined for the IFF UE RF test method
described in clause 5.2.3 can be applied.

\- The Quiet Zone definition for the IFF UE RF test method described in
clause 5.2.3 can be applied.

#### 6.2.1.3 Testing and calibration aspects

The calibration method defined for the DFF UE RF test method described
in clause 5.2.1 can be applied for UE RRM testing based on DFF \[for
each probe/AoA\]. The calibration method defined for the IFF test method
described in clause 5.2.3 can be applied for the UE RRM testing based on
IFF. The calibration method defined for the simplified DFF UE RF test
method described in clause 5.2.2 can be applied for UE RRM testing based
on simplified DFF.

#### 6.2.1.4 Test parameters and metrics

##### 6.2.1.4.1 Test parameters and metrics required for UE RRM testing

The following test parameters and metrics need to be supported for UE
RRM testing.

Test parameters for RRM testing to be controlled at the reference point:

\- SNR of DL signal

\- DL power level (e.g. EPRE) (from AoA)

\- Relative DL power level of 2 signals

\- From intra-frequency or inter-frequency cells

\- From the same AoA or different AoAs.

\- Relative DL timing of 2 signals

\- Faded DL channel for each signal

\- AoA for arriving signals

Metrics for RRM testing at the reference point:

\- UL PRACH level transmitted by the UE

\- Relative UL PRACH level transmitted by the UE

\- Timing of UE UL transmission relative to DL signal

\- Relative timing change of UE UL transmission relative to DL signal

\- Timing measurement of UL events caused by events on the DL

##### 6.2.1.4.2 Radiated requirements Reference point and Testing directions

For RRM baseline measurement setup based on DFF and IFF, the reference
point is located at the centre of the QZ. From the UE perspective the
reference point is the input of UE antenna array.

Calibration of power level and relative power level test parameters and
RRM metrics (at the required AoAs) is required and shall be provided by
the test system.

Appropriate timing and relative timing test parameters and RRM metrics
(at the required AoAs) shall be provided by the test system within
declared uncertainties.

The following Modes for useful signals (S) and noise signals (N)
configuration have been identified and can be supported by the NR RRM
Test Methods:

\- Mode 1 (SNR emulation): Test system transmits useful signals (S) and
noise signals (N) to emulate target SNR condition.

\- Mode 2 (noise-free transmission): Test system transmits only useful
signals (S).

The test cases in core specification TS 38.133 \[17\] will be specified
at the reference point, according to the following principles:

\- Mode 1

\- Specify absolute Noc level at the Reference point per angle of
arrival (AoA)

\- Noc level may have different value according to operating band and UE
power class

\- Specify SNR at the Reference point per angle of arrival (AoA)

\- SNR is a test-specific value

\- The angle(s) of arrival (AoA(s)) will be specified in each test case.

height="1.5763888888888888in"}

Figure 6.2.1.4.2-1: DL SNR reference point for RRM testing methodology

The following Scenarios for RRM requirements have been identified and
can be supported by the NR RRM test methods:

\- Scenario 1: RRM requirement with single Angle of Arrival (1 AoA) with
signal coming from RX beam peak direction.

\- Scenario 2: RRM requirement with single Angle of Arrival (1 AoA) with
signal coming from RX non-beam peak direction.

\- The test can be performed in any single direction which is covered by
N^th^ percentile EIS spherical coverage of the DUT

\- Value of N is according to FR2 UE power class, as defined in TS
38.101-2 \[16\] clause 7.3.4.

\- Scenario 3: RRM requirement with two Angle of Arrivals (2 AoAs).

\- Test directions:

\- Both signals come from the directions covered by the N% percentile
EIS spherical coverage of the DUT

\- The angle between two probes should match the relative probe spacing
of 30, 60, 90, 120, 150 deg and UE is in the directions in which the UE
RRM test cases can be performed.

\- Value of N is according to FR2 UE power class, as defined in TS
38.101-2 \[16\] clause 7.3.4.

\- The following sub-cases are considered

\- Case 1: TDM transmissions from 2 probes (i.e. each probe transmits
both signal and/or artificial noise in TDM manner).

\- Case 2: Simultaneous transmission of signals from 2 probes

\- The details on how to control the SINR for Case 1 and Case 2 are
provided in Annex H.

Note: No conclusions on the feasibility of generating the testable side
conditions made for Case 2. The feasibility of generating the testable
side conditions for Case 2 can be further studied in the future
releases.

The following Types of RRM requirements have been identified and can be
supported by the NR RRM test methods:

\- Type 1:

\- RRM requirements defined under the assumption that the UE is using
\"Fine\" UE RX beams.

\- \"Fine\" UE RX beams are the beams used by the UE to perform PDSCH
reception and used to define UE RF requirements (e.g. EIS, EIS spherical
coverage)

\- Type 2:

\- Requirements defined under the assumption that the UE is using
\"Rough\" UE RX beams.

\- \"Rough\" UE RX beams are the beams which the UE is using for RRM
measurements (e.g. for SSB measurements)

For selecting the testing direction (AoA to test the requirement)
fulfilling certain preconditions, two methods are feasible from the
perspective of RRM baseline measurement setup, as follows:

\- Method 1: Run a pretest in the RRM baseline measurement system to
identify all the directions (with a given spatial granularity) at which
the UE fulfils a given precondition (e.g. spherical coverage EIS). The
testing directions are then chosen out of the valid directions,
following a given rule. The precondition to be fulfilled, and the rule
how to select the testing direction out of the valid directions, are
specified in the test description.

\- Method 2: For each given potential direction, test first a given
precondition (e.g. minimum TP for a given power), which validates the
direction as valid for testing or not. If the direction is valid, test
the requirement, if not, jump to the next potential direction following
a given rule. The rule how to select the potential directions and the
precondition to validate them as testing direction, are specified in the
test description.

##### 6.2.1.4.3 Scenario 1 (1AoA RX beam peak) for Type 1 Requirements (\"Fine\" RX beams) and Mode 1 Configuration (S+N)

Conditions chosen for conducted RRM Test cases assume that the noise
contribution of the UE front end is negligible. For over-the-air testing
it is not feasible in practice to use signal levels high enough to make
the noise of the UE front end negligible. A number of scenarios occur in
the design of RRM test cases:

a\) One or more side conditions are deliberately set near a lower limit,
for example some RSRP reporting accuracy tests

b\) A test is designed to check an event at a specific SNR, for example
Radio Link Monitoring

c\) The SNR is not critical provided it is high enough for the test
purpose

For test cases where the SNR seen by the UE at baseband is critical:

\- Set wanted noise to give a maximum of 1dB difference between
Reference point SNR and Baseband SNR, so SNR~RP~ - SNR~BB~ ≤ 1dB

*Figure 6.2.1.4.3-1 shows the principle for UE power class 3 in Band
n260, with an example SNR value.*

*The Noc values are based on Refsens for the Operating band and on the
UE Power class, and taking a baseline of UE Power class 3 in Band n260.*

SNoc = Refsens~PC3,\ n260,\ 50MHz~ -10Log~10~(SCS~Refsens~ x
PRB~Refsens~ x 12) - SNR~Refsens~ + ∆~thermal~

*where:*

\- Refsens~PC3,\ n260,\ 50MHz~ is the Refsens value in dBm specified for
Power Class 3 in Band n260 for 50MHz Channel bandwidth in TS 38.101-2
\[16\] Table 7.3.2.3-1, \[dBm/Hz\]

\- SCS~Refsens~ is a subcarrier spacing associated with N~RB~ for 50MHz
in TS 38.101-2 \[16\] Table 5.3.2-1, chosen as 120kHz., \[Hz\]

\- PRBs~Refsens~ is N~RB~ associated with subcarrier spacing 120 kHz for
50MHz in TS 38.101-2 \[16\] Table 5.3.2-1 and is 32.

\- 12 is the number of subcarriers in a PRB

\- SNR~Refsens~ is the SNR used for simulation of Refsens, and is -1dB

\- ∆~thermal~ is the amount of dB that the wanted noise is set above UE
thermal noise, giving a rise in total noise of **∆~BB~**. ∆~thermal~ is
chosen as 6dB, giving a rise in total noise of 1dB**.**

height="2.6944444444444446in"}

**Figure 6.2.1.4.3-1: Reference point SNR~RP~ and Baseband SNR~BB~**

The following methodology to define the minimum Noc level for power
class X (PC\_X) and operating band Y (Band\_Y) is used for the single
carrier case and a single band device:

Noc(PC\_X, Band\_Y) = -155 dBm/Hz + Refsens~PC\_X,\ Band\_Y,\ 50MHz~ --
Refsens~PC3,\ n260,\ 50MHz~

*where:*

\- *Refsens values are specified in TS 38.101-2* \[16\] Tables
7.3.2.1-1, 7.3.2.2-1, 7.3.2.3-1 and 7.3.2.4-1*.*

*The Noc values derived by the above equations are the minimum that
should be used in an RRM test case to ensure that* SNR~BB~ ≥ SNR~RP~
-1dB.

Depending on the test purpose, each RRM test case should decide whether
to use a band and/or UE power class dependent Noc value, or whether a
single Noc value is adequate.

##### 6.2.1.4.4 Scenario 1 (1AoA RX beam peak) for Type 2 Requirements (\"Rough\" RX beams) and Mode 1 Configuration (S+N)

The Noc is derived similar as in clause 6.2.1.4.3 with the following
exception:

\- Noc level is increased by Y, where:

\- Value Y characterizes the antenna gain difference between the fine
and rough beams in the 'fine' RX beam peak direction.

7 UE demodulation and CSI testing methodology
=============================================

7.1 General
-----------

This clause describes the testing methodology for NR UE demodulation and
CSI reporting for FR2. Unless otherwise indicated below, device under
test (DUT) refers to UE nodes. The exact list of demodulation and CSI
reporting tests for the UE can only be determined once the core
requirements are settled and the test methodologies are considered in
generic way to allow testing of typical UE demodulation CSI metrics.

For frequency bands in FR2 (e.g. mm-wave), conducted antenna connectors
are assumed not to be available at DUT and the OTA testing is considered
as the baseline approach for NR UE demodulation and CSI test
methodology.

The possibility of performing conducted tests using an intermediate
frequency (IF) were evaluated. It was decided that this approach would
be challenging to standardise for various reasons since IF is an
internal interface in the DUT and using a standardised IF (signal level,
number of IF ports, IF frequency etc.) would preclude many different DUT
implementations including direct conversion receivers. In addition, IF
testing excludes all components which operate at the radio frequency
such as RF filters, duplexers, transmit receive switch, low noise
amplifier (LNA), power amplifier (PA), analogue beamforming phase
shifting elements etc., and the algorithms which control such components
from the test.

7.2 Measurement setup
---------------------

### 7.2.1 Baseline setup

#### 7.2.1.1 Description

The baseline measurement setup of NR UE demodulation and CSI
characteristics for frequency bands in FR2 is capable of establishing an
OTA link between the DUT and a number of emulated gNB sources with one
angle of arrival (AoA) to the UE, and is shown in Figure 7.2.1.1-1
below.

![](media/image18.emf){width="2.6041666666666665in"
height="1.3402777777777777in"}

Figure 7.2.1.1-1: Baseline measurement setup for UE demodulation and
CSI\
characteristics testing

The key aspects of the baseline setup are:

\- Test is conducted in an anechoic chamber

> \- The test shall be performed in the radiative near field or in the
> far field
>
> \- The minimum measurement distance is described in 7.2.1.2

\- The following permitted test setups are considered

> \- DFF test setup as described in Clause 5.
>
> \- Simplified DFF test setup as described in Clause 5.
>
> \- IFF test setup as described in Clause 5.
>
> \- Direct near field (DNF) test setup.
>
> \- Note: No final conclusions on the feasibility of DNF setup were
> made.

\- One TRxP with a dual-polarized measurement antenna directed at the
DUT

\- Propagation Conditions

> \- Test method shall allow modelling of the following propagation
> conditions between the DUT and the emulated gNB sources
>
> \- Multi-path fading propagation conditions
>
> \- Multi-path fading propagation conditions between the DUT and the
> emulated gNB sources are modelled as Single probe channel models as
> described in clause 8.2.
>
> \- Static propagation conditions

\- A positioning system such that the angle between the dual-polarized
measurement antenna and the DUT has at least two axes of freedom

\- The test method shall achieve isolation between two nominally
orthogonal paths from the dual-polarised TRxP to the DUT, enabling
independent control of the signals reaching each baseband receiver

\- Test method supports up to DL MIMO rank 2 transmissions

\- DUTs shall support power measurement per receiver port (SS-RSRPB).
Measurement equipment may use SS-RSRPB reporting from the DUT to achieve
isolation and to enable independent control of the signals reaching each
baseband receiver.

\- SS-RSRPB measurements and reporting are done under noise-free
conditions and use static channel conditions.

\- Once established, the setup is expected to be fixed and to be used
with UE Tx/Rx beamlock to allow testing of DUT baseband features under a
\"virtually cabled\" scenario.

\- Baseline setup includes a capability to select the best UE RX beam
during initial call setup.

\- Support of **UE demodulation and CSI** requirements verification for
interworking scenarios

\- For setups intended for measurements of UE demodulation and CSI
characteristics in non-standalone (NSA) mode, an LTE link antenna is
used to provide the LTE link to the DUT. The LTE link antenna provides a
stable and noise-free LTE signal without precise path loss or
polarization control. No performance verification for LTE carriers is
supported.

\- For setups intended for measurements of UE demodulation and CSI
characteristics in NR CA mode with FR1 and FR2 inter-band NR CA, test
setup provides NR FR1 link to the DUT. The NR FR1 link has a stable and
noise-free signal without precise path loss or polarization control. No
performance verification for NR FR1 carriers is supported.

\- The test system shall allow the following modes of noise emulation
for UE demodulation testing:

\- Mode 1: Emulation of fixed SNR conditions at the DUT

\- Mode 2: Emulation of noise-free conditions at the DUT

\- Measurement system shall support the TX EVM (transmit signal error
vector magnitude) not worse than 6% for QPSK/16QAM/64QAM performance
requirements.

\- The baseline setup shall allow identification of the DUT RX beam peak
direction

\- Note: RX beam peak search procedure for the DNF setup is undefined.

\-- Applicability Criteria:

In case a DNF test setup is used, the system applies at least to DUTs
with a device size of D ≤ 15cm with no manufacturer declaration and
corresponding SNR calculations in Annex B.3.1 need to be used.

\- In case a DFF or IFF test system is used that leverages the permitted
methods for UE RF, the same applicability criteria as in Clause 5.2
apply and corresponding SNR calculations in Annex B.3.2 and B.3.3
respectively need to be used.

#### 7.2.1.2 Measurement distance

The test shall be performed in the radiative near field (limit of the
Fresnel region) or in the far field. The minimum measurement distance
*R* is defined according to the following formula:

$R > 0.62\sqrt{\frac{D^{3}}{\lambda}}$

where *D* is the DUT radiating aperture, and *λ* is the wavelength.

In case a test system is used that leverages the permitted methods for
UE RF, the same measurement distance as in Clause 5 apply.

#### 7.2.1.3 Test parameters

The following main test parameters shall be controlled by measurement
equipment for UE Demodulation and CSI reporting testing.

\- SNR of DL signal at reference point

\- Faded DL channel

For a DNF setup the reference point for SNR of DL signal is defined as
the interclause of the axes of rotation of the positioning system(s).
For a DFF or IFF setups the reference point for SNR of DL signal is
defined as the geometrical center of the QZ. From the UE perspective the
reference point is the input of UE antenna array.

![](media/image16.emf){width="3.2152777777777777in"
height="1.5763888888888888in"}

**Figure 7.2.1.3-1: DL SNR reference point for UE Demodulation and CSI
testing methodology**

The performance requirements in TS 38.101-4 \[18\] will be specified at
the reference point, according to the following principles:

\- Mode 1 (fixed SNR emulation)

\- Test system will transmit the useful signal and noise signals to
emulate target SNR condition.

\- Specify absolute Noc level at the reference point

\- Noc level may have different value according to operating band and UE
Power class

\- Specify SNR~RP~ at the reference point

\- SNR~RP~ is a test-specific value

\- Mode 2 (noise-free emulation)

\- Test system will transmit the useful signal only

\- Specify absolute Es level at the reference point

\- Downlink signal and noise are aligned to the direction with the
following criteria:

Select the known Rx beam peak direction reused from RF testing if
available, as far as it satisfies minimum isolation requirement defined
in TS 38.521-4 \[21\] and rank number in TS 38.521-4 \[21\]
corresponding to the test cases

Otherwise select one direction which satisfied the REFSENS defined in TS
38.101-2 \[16\], minimum isolation requirement defined in TS 38.521-4
\[21\] and rank number in TS 38.521-4 \[21\] corresponding to the test
cases.

##### 7.2.1.3.1 Test parameters for Mode 1

Simulations for UE demodulation and CSI are normally run at baseband,
with results expressed as SNR~BB~, and do not take into account the
noise of the UE RF front end. For over-the-air testing it is not
feasible in practice to use signal levels high enough to make the noise
of the UE RF front end negligible. The approach below has been agreed:

\- Set wanted noise to give 1dB difference between Reference point SNR
and Baseband SNR, using agreed UE requirements, so SNR~RP~ = SNR~BB~ +
1dB

\- Figure 7.2.1.3-2 shows the principle

*The Noc values are based on REFSENS for the operating band and on the
UE Power class, and taking a baseline of UE Power Class 3 in band n260.*

*Noc = RESFENS~PC3,\ n260,\ 50MHz~ -10log~10~(SCS*~REFSENS~ *x
PRB*~REFSENS~ *x 12) - SNR*~REFSENS~ *+ ∆~thermal~*

*where:*

\- REFSENS~PC3,\ n260,\ 50MHz~ is the REFSENSvalue in dBm specified for
Power Class 3 UE in band n260 for 50MHz channel bandwidth in TS 38.101-2
\[16\] Table 7.3.2.3-1*, \[dBm/Hz\]*

\- SCS~REFSENS~ is a subcarrier spacing associated with N~RB~ for 50MHz
in TS 38.101-2 \[16\] Table 5.3.2-1, chosen as 120kHz.

\- PRB~REFSENS~ is N~RB~ associated with subcarrier spacing 120kHz for
50MHz in TS 38.101-2 \[16\] Table 5.3.2-1 and is 32.

\- 12 is the number of subcarriers in a PRB

\- SNR~REFSENS~ = -1 dB is the SNR used for simulation of REFSENS

\- ∆~thermal~ is the amount of dB that the wanted noise is set above UE
thermal noise, giving a rise in total noise of **∆~BB~**. ∆~thermal~ =
6dB, giving a rise in total noise of 1dB**.**

Figure 7.2.1.3-2: Reference point SNR~RP~ and Baseband SNR~BB~

*The calculated Noc value for the baseline of UE Power class 3 in Band
n260 is rounded to -155dBm/Hz.*

The following methodology to define the minimum Noc level for power
class X (PC\_X) and operating band Y (Band\_Y) is used for the single
carrier case and a single band device:

Noc(PC\_X, Band\_Y) = -155 dBm/Hz + REFSENS~PC\_X,\ Band\_Y,\ 50MHz~ --
REFSENS~PC3,\ n260,\ 50MHz~

*where REFSENS values are specified in TS 38.101-2* \[16\] Table
7.3.2.3-1*.*

The following methodology to define the minimum Noc level for a
multi-band device:

Noc~MB~ = Noc~SB~ + ΣMB~P~

\- Noc~SB~ is the Noc defined above for a single band device;

\- ΣMB~P~ values are specified in TS 38.101-2 \[16\].

For CA case, the Noc power level (Noc~CA~) shall increase by a
relaxation factor defined in TS 38.101-2 \[16\] Table 7.3A.2.1-1.

> Noc~CA~ = Noc~SC~ + ΔR~IB~

\- Noc~SC~ is derived by assuming UE supports single carrier.

\- ΔR~IB~ values are specified in TS 38.101-2 \[16\].

UE Demodulation and CSI requirements can be defined for any SNR range.

The test system shall be able to determine whether it can provide the
SNR necessary for a specific test case. If required SNR is larger than
the SNR upper bound that can be emulated by test system, the
corresponding requirement can currently not be tested.

The upper bound SNR (SNR~max~) for Mode 1 at the baseband can be
estimated as follows:

> SNR~max~ = P~s,max~ / P~noise,Σ~
>
> P~noise,Σ~ = Noc \* BW + *N~noiseRF~* \* BW
>
> P~total,max~ = P~s,max~ + Noc \* BW
>
> SNR~max~ = (P~total,max~ - Noc \* BW) / ((Noc + *N~noiseRF~*) \* BW)

where,

\- P~noise,Σ~: Total equivalent UE receive noise power level at
reference point

\- *N~noiseRF~*: UE RF noise power spectrum density at reference point
for the particular scenario which can be derived similar to the Noc
power level except the fact that *∆~thermal~* offset shall not be added
(*N~noiseRF~ = Noc / ∆~thermal~).*

\- P~s,max~: Maximum power level of the desired RX signal at the
reference point

\- BW: Channel bandwidth, Hz (i.e. test specific parameter)

\- P~total,max~: Maximum power level of the desired RX signal at the
reference point which can be supported by the test equipment

> Note: In the above, all symbols are represented as linear (non-dB)
> values.

Example assessment of testable DL SNR range for Mode 1 is provided in
Annex B.3.

##### 7.2.1.3.2 Test parameters for Mode 2

For Mode 2 the test system shall transmit the wanted signal with power
level Es which is the best achievable power level by the test system.

The test system shall be able to determine achievable Es level for the
noise free tests for all test cases.

For sustained data rate tests, the test system shall be also capable to
determine the upper bound SNR which will be observed at the UE taking
into account the UE RF characteristics. The upper bound SNR (SNR~max~)
for Mode 2 at the baseband can be estimated as follows:

> SNR~max~ = P~s,max~ / P~noise,Σ~
>
> P~noise,Σ~ = *N~noiseRF~* \* BW
>
> P~total,max~ = P~s,max~
>
> SNR~max~ = P~total,max~ / (*N~noiseRF~* \* BW)

where,

\- P~noise,Σ~: Total equivalent UE receive noise power level at
reference point

\- *N~noiseRF~*: UE RF noise power spectrum density at reference point
for the particular scenario which can be derived similar to the Noc
power level for Mode 1 except the fact that *∆~thermal~* offset shall
not be added (*N~noiseRF~ = Noc / ∆~thermal~).*

\- P~s,max~: Maximum power level of the desired RX signal at the
reference point

\- BW: Channel bandwidth, Hz (i.e. test specific parameter)

\- P~total,max~: Maximum power level of the desired RX signal at the
reference point which can be supported by the test equipment

Note: In the above, all symbols are represented as linear (non-dB)
values.

#### 7.2.1.4 Test metrics

The test method shall allow testing of typical UE Demodulation and CSI
metrics similar to the metrics used of LTE, including at least:

\- Absolute PDSCH throughput

\- Block-error rate performance for different DL physical channels (e.g.
PDCCH)

\- CSI statistics (e.g. CQI accuracy, throughput ratio for different CSI
or test settings, etc.)

7.3 Summary of initial uncertainty assessment

The detailed analysis of MU factors affecting DL SNR accuracy/range
measurement uncertainty is provided in Annex B.3.1.

8 Propagation conditions
========================

8.1 General
-----------

Test methods shall allow modelling of the following propagation
conditions between the DUT and the emulated gNB sources:

\- Multi-path fading propagation conditions

\- Fading propagation conditions between the DUT and the emulated gNB
sources are modelled as Single probe channel models as described in
clause 8.2.

\- Applicable to the UE RRM testing methodology and UE Demodulation and
CSI testing methodology.

\- Static propagation conditions

\- Model is described in clause 8.3.

\- Applicable to the UE RRM testing methodology and UE Demodulation and
CSI testing methodology.

8.2 Multi-path fading propagation conditions
--------------------------------------------

Multi-path fading propagation conditions between the DUT and the
emulated gNB sources are modelled as Single probe channel models.

### 8.2.1 Single probe channel modelling methodology

Two options for Single probe channel modelling methodology were
identified as described in clause 8.2.1.1 and 8.2.1.2, including details
on generating each single probe channel option.

Both Option 1 and Option 2 methodologies were concluded as feasible from
test equipment perspective. Selection between the methodologies and the
selection of specific parameters (e.g. power delay profile) are to be
done in the scope of Rel. 15 NR UE performance requirements work.

FR2 measurement system is expected to support modelling of multi-path
fading for single carrier scenarios with channel bandwidth of at least
200 MHz. The support of channel modelling for CA scenarios is not
precluded.

#### 8.2.1.1 Channel model Option 1

Channel model option 1 is based on the TDL methodology in the TR 38.901
\[10\]:

\- The multi-path propagation conditions model consists of several
parts:

\- A power delay profile in the form of a \"tapped delay-line\" (TDL),
characterized by a number of taps with certain power at fixed positions
on a sampling grid.

\- The channel model parameters include the Delay spread scaling factor
and the maximum Doppler frequency. The test system shall allow flexible
control of the respective parameters.

\- Each tap is modeled based on the Jakes fading model.

\- Generation of TDL channel models and power delay profiles from CDL
channel models by including spatial filters to capture Tx and Rx antenna
patterns is not precluded and based on the procedure described in the TR
38.901 \[10\].

The method to generate fading coefficients (Jakes fading model)
satisfying the target parameters is not specified in \[10\].
Traditionally, there has been two methods to implement this type of
tapped delay line models:

\- The first alternative is to use the noise filtering, where the
Doppler power spectrum is realized by Doppler spectrum shaping filtering
of i.i.d. complex Gaussian noise sample sequences. This step is followed
by generating the MIMO correlations between sequences by multiplying
them with factored target MIMO correlation matrix. The matrix has
dimensions US x US, where U and S denote the number of Rx and Tx
antennas, respectively.

\- The second alternative is the sum-of-sinusoids method, where the
temporal characteristics (Doppler power spectrum) are generated by
summing a number of sinusoids with specific phase, amplitude and
frequency characteristics. This step is followed by generating the MIMO
correlations between sequences by multiplying them with factored target
MIMO correlation matrix. The matrix has dimensions US x US, where U and
S denote the number of Rx and Tx antennas, respectively.

#### 8.2.1.2 Channel model Option 2

This clause considers channel model methodology with non-Jakes spectrum.
Multi-path fading propagation conditions between the gNB emulator and
test chamber probe is modelled based on Clustered Delay Line (CDL)
methodology in TR 38.901 \[10\]. Doppler Spread and MIMO correlation
related to such methodology is defined in clauses 8.2.1.2.1 and
8.2.1.2.2 respectively.

To generate the multi-path fading propagation conditions, the following
step by step procedure modified from \[10\] should be used to generate
channel coefficients using the CDL models:

[Step 1:]{.underline} Generate cluster delays (from clause 7.7.3 in
\[10\])

The RMS delay spread values of CDL models are normalized and they must
be scaled in delay so that a desired RMS delay spread can be achieved.
The scaled delays can be obtained according to the following equation:

(8.2.1.2-1)

in which

> \- is the normalized delay value of the *n*th cluster in a CDL in
> Tables 7.7.1.1 -- 7.7.1.5 of \[10\]
>
> \- is the new delay value (in \[ns\]) of the *n*th cluster
>
> \- is the wanted delay spread (in \[ns\]) and it must be specified as
> a channel model parameter

[Step 1.1:]{.underline} In the case of LOS models (D and E) scale
cluster the powers as specified in clause 7.7.6 of \[10\]. The target
Ricean K-factor values *K*~desired~ must be specified.

[Step 2:]{.underline} Generate departure and arrival angles (based on
clause 7.7.1 step 1 in \[10\] combining 7.7-5 and part of step 7 in
clause 7.5 in \[10\] adding some clarifications to the parameters
considered)

Generate arrival angles of azimuth using the following equation

, (8.2.1.2-2)

where

*- φ~n,~*~AOA~ and *c*~ASA~ are the cluster AOA and the cluster-wise rms
azimuth spread of arrival angles (cluster ASA), respectively, in Tables
7.7.1.1 -- 7.7.1.5 of \[10\]

*- α~m~* denotes the ray offset angles within a cluster given by Table
7.5-3 of \[10\],

*-* is the mean angle of the original channel model table in NLOS case
(equation is specified in Annex A.2 of \[10\]) and the LOS angle in LOS
case,

*-* are the angular spreads. derived^1)^ from the original CDL Tables
7.7.1.1 -- 7.7.1.5 of \[10\], they are listed in Table 8.2.1.2-1

*-* is the wanted angular spread. It must be specified.

The angular scaling according to eq. (2) is applied to the ray angles
and no further scaling is performed. The generation of AOD (), ZSA (),
and ZSD () follows a procedure similar to AOA as described above.

Note: The azimuth angles may need to be wrapped around to be within \[0,
360\] degrees, while the zenith angles may need to be clipped to be
within \[0, 180\] degrees.

^1)^ *The angular spread in this case is the rms angular spread without
finding the minimum value over angular rotations.*

Table 8.2.1.2-1. Original (non-circular) angle spreads of CDL models.

  Model   \[deg\]                 
  ------- --------- ------ ------ ------
          ASD       ASA    ZSD    ZSA
  CDL-A   73.7      85.3   28.6   21.1
  CDL-B   41.6      59.3   6.0    10.4
  CDL-C   39.1      71.1   4.1    10.4
  CDL-D   19.0      21.1   3.0    1.9
  CDL-E   13.2      37.6   1.5    2.5

Table 8.2.1.2-1 contains the angle spread values of the original CDL
models of 38.901 (\[2\]) before any angular scaling. The values are
calculated for the angles AOD, AOA, ZOD, and ZOA angles after removing
the mean angle ![](media/image33.png)![](media/image33.png) following
the definition of rms angular spread in TR25.997, without finding the
minimum over circular shifts.

[Step 3:]{.underline} Coupling of rays within a cluster for both azimuth
and elevation (based on step 2 in 7.7.1 in \[10\] assuming fix coupling
instead of random)

Couple AOD angles to AOA angles within a cluster *n*. Couple ZOD angles
with ZOA angles using the same procedure. Couple AOD angles with ZOD
angles within a cluster *n*. Instead of random procedure, the coupling
is performed using the fixed coupling pattern. It must be specified.

[Step 4:]{.underline} Generate the cross-polarization power ratios (from
clause 7.7.1 step 3 in \[10\])

Calculate the linear cross polarization power ratios (XPR) *κ* for each
ray *m* of each cluster *n* as

, (8.2.1.2-3)

where *X* is the per-cluster XPR in dB and must be specified.

[Step 5:]{.underline} Specify gNB beam pattern (based on clause 7.3 of
\[10\] plus assumptions for gNB antenna)

With definitions and symbols of clause 7.3 of \[10\] (except substitute
N:=*N~e~*, M:=*M~e~* to avoid ambiguity), specify parameters
(*M~g~*, *N~g~*, *M~e~*, *N~e~*, *P*) and (*d~H~*, *d~V~).*

Antenna element radiation patterns, including orientation of the element
main polarization components as well as orientation of the antenna array
should be specified.

It is assumed the co-polarized elements of the array are combined to a
single RF port, i.e. they compose an antenna array that can form beams
by setting certain weights per element. Weight vector for the first
polarization and for the second polarization is

![](media/image39.png)![](media/image39.png) (8.2.1.2-4)

where is the location vector of transmit antenna element
![](media/image41.png)![](media/image41.png) and
![](media/image42.png)![](media/image42.png).

[Step 6]{.underline}: Specify initial phases

Instead of drawing initial phases
![](media/image43.wmf){width="1.4861111111111112in"
height="0.2638888888888889in"} randomly for each ray *m* of each cluster
*n* and for four different polarisation combinations (*θθ*, *θϕ,* *ϕθ,*
*ϕϕ*), initial phases must be specified.

[Step 7:]{.underline} Coefficient generation (based on step 4 in \[10\])

Follow the same procedure as in Steps 10 and 11 in Subclause 7.5 in
\[10\], with the exception that all clusters are treated as \"weaker
cluster\", i.e. no further sub-clusters in delay should be
generated^2)^. Additional clusters representing delay spread of the
stronger clusters are already provided in Tables 7.7.1.1 -- 7.7.1.5 in
\[10\]. Once weight vector in equation 4 is combined with eq. (7.5-22)
and eq. (7.5-29) in \[10\], the following equations apply respectively:

![](media/image44.png) (8.2.1.2-5)

![](media/image45.png) (8.2.1.2-6)

where s goes from 1 to S, being S the number of gNB RF ports

^2)^ *Note: This may need to be changed such that the three rows of CDL
tables containing equal angular parameters are treated as a single
cluster with three mid-paths as in Step 11 of Subclause 7.5 in \[10\].*

As shown above, this model is using following parameters

\- Base CDL model from CDL models defined in \[10, Subclause 7.7.1\]
characterized by normalized delay, power, AOA, AOD, ZOA and ZOD for each
cluster; delay spread, angular spread and mean angle for AOA, AOD, ZOA
and ZOD. Further simplification of CDL models in \[10, Subclause 7.7.1\]
can be defined in UE demodulation performance discussion.

\- Emulated gNB related parameters: gNB antenna field pattern, gNB
antenna orientation and polarization

\- Emulated UE related parameters: UE antenna field pattern, UE antenna
orientation and polarization, UE speed and direction

\- Initial phases ![](media/image43.wmf){width="1.4861111111111112in"
height="0.2638888888888889in"} for each ray *m* of each cluster *n* for
NLOS paths and distance d~3D~ (explained in \[10, Figure 7.4.1-1\] to
model LOS path loss) for LOS path.

\- Tx/Rx beam selection procedure between emulated gNB and emulated UE
antenna

\- Ricean K factor for LOS CDL base models

\- Carrier Frequency

\- Fixed pairing between angles of arrival and angles of departure in
Step 2 described in \[10, Subclause 7.7.1\].

##### 8.2.1.2.1 MIMO Correlation

From equation 7.5-22 in \[10\], fading coefficients are generated per Tx
per Rx for each cluster. Therefore, MIMO correlation matrix can be
computed from those coefficients for each cluster. So, MIMO correlation
matrix spectrum is implicit in the way we generate the fading channel
coefficients and does not need to be modelled explicitly.

It is noted that the MIMO correlation can be controlled by introducing
Ricean K-factor to all model scenarios and setting the K-factor
properly. Alternatively, the MIMO correlation can be controlled by
modifying the XPR parameter. However, this depends on the selected
antenna model.

### 8.2.2 Path Delay grid for channel models

The path delay grid for the channel models is defined as equidistant
delay grid n\*∆T with n∈N~0.~ From the test methodology perspective it
is feasible to support ∆T≤1/ F~sample~.

For single carrier scenarios with channel bandwidth up to 200MHz, the
F~sample~ is defined as 200 MHz and ∆T ≤ 5 ns. For the channel models
definition for the requirements definition a fixed quantization grid can
be used (e.g. ∆T = 5ns).

For intra-band CA scenarios the F~sample~ requires further studies. The
F~sample~ used for these scenarios will be discussed and decided as part
of the NR work item performance part.

In case multiple taps of the original delay profile end up with the same
delay, the powers of the individual taps are added, resulting in a
single path with the combined power.

Each tap of the scaled delay profile shall be mapped to the closest
point of the delay grid defined by n\*∆T. In case a tap in the delay
profile lies equidistant between two points of the delay grid, it shall
be mapped to the larger delay grid point.

An example for mapping the delays for a scaled power delay profile to
the equidistant delay grid is given in clause 8.2.2.1.

#### 8.2.2.1 Example for determining the resulting delay profile

A power delay profile after delay spread scaling is given as follows in
Table 8.2.2.1-1.

Table 8.2.2.1-1: Original power delay profile

  **Tap *k***   **Power** $\sigma_{k}^{2}$ ***σ~k~^2^* (linear)**   **Delay *τ****~k~* **\[ns\]**

  2             *σ~2~^2^*                                           8
  3             *σ~3~^2^*                                           23

  5             *σ~5~^2^*                                           27

With the assumption of ∆T = 1/(200 MHz) = 5 ns the taps from Table
8.2.2.1-1 can be mapped onto an equidistant delay grid as shown in Table
8.2.2.1-2.

Table 8.2.2.1-2: Power delay profile after mapping to delay grid

  **Tap *k***   **Power** $\sigma_{k}^{2}$ ***σ~k~^2^* (linear)**   **Delay** $\tau_{k}$ ***τ**~k~* **\[ns\]**

  1             *σ~1~^2^*                                           0
  2             *σ~2~^2^*                                           10
  3             *σ~3~^2^*                                           25
  4             *σ~4~^2^*                                           25
  5             *σ~5~^2^*                                           25

Since multiple taps share the same delay, those taps need to be combined
into a single tap as shown in Table 8.2.2.1-3.

Table 8.2.2.1-3: Resulting delay profile

  **Tap k**   **Power** $\sigma_{k}^{2}$ ***σ~k~^2^* (linear)**   **Delay** $\tau_{k}$ ***τ**~k~* **\[ns\]**

8.3 Static propagation conditions
---------------------------------

The test methods shall allow emulation of the following static
propagation conditions for the UE with 2RX antenna port as follows.

For 1 port transmission the emulated channel matrix is defined in the
frequency domain by

For 2 port transmission the emulated channel matrix is defined in the
frequency domain by

Note: Channel matrices above for static propagation conditions are the
channel matrices generated by the channel emulator.

########  Annex A: Environment conditions

A.1 Operating voltage
=====================

All nominal voltage test cases shall be performed with the DUT operated
in stand-alone battery powered mode except for DUTs whose power is
provided only from AC mains. For extreme voltage test cases, the UE
shall fulfil all the requirements in the full voltage range, i.e. the
voltage range between the extreme voltages. When those test cases
require an external power source with cables connected to the DUT that
could adversely affect the device performance, it shall be demonstrated
that there is negligible impact to performance with the device operated
in stand-alone battery powered mode compared to the device operated in
external power mode first before performing the extreme voltage test
cases.

########  Annex B: Measurement uncertainty

B.1 Measurement uncertainty budget for UE RF testing methodology
================================================================

B.1.1 Direct far field (DFF) setup
----------------------------------

### B.1.1.1 Uncertainty budget calculation principle

The uncertainty tables should be presented with two stages:

\- Stage 1: the calibration of the absolute level of the DUT measurement
results is performed by means of using a calibration antenna whose
absolute gain is known at the frequencies of measurement

\- Stage 2: the actual measurement with the DUT as either the
transmitter or receiver is performed.

The MU budget should comprise of a minimum 5 headings:

1\) The uncertainty source,

2\) Uncertainty value,

3\) Distribution of the probability,

4\) Divisor based on distribution shape,

5\) Calculated standard uncertainty (based on uncertainty value and
divisor).

### B.1.1.3 Uncertainty assessment

The uncertainty assessment tables are organized as follows:

\- For the purpose of uncertainty assessment, the radiating antenna
aperture of the DUT is denoted as D, and the uncertainty assessment has
been derived for the case of D = 5 cm

\- The uncertainty assessment for EIRP and TRP, assuming D = 5 cm, is
provided in Table B.1.1.3-1

\- The uncertainty assessment for EIS, assuming D = 5 cm, is provided in
Table B.1.1.3-2

### B.1.1.4 Measurement error contribution descriptions

#### B.1.1.4.1 Positioning misalignment

This contribution originates from the misalignment of the testing
direction and the beam peak direction of the receiving antenna due to
imperfect rotation operation. The pointing misalignment may happen in
both azimuth and vertical directions and the effect of the misalignment
depends highly on the beamwidth of the beam under test. The same level
of misalignment results in a larger measurement error for a narrower
beam.

#### B.1.1.4.2 Measure distance uncertainty

The cause of this uncertainty contributor is due to the reduction of
distance between the measurement antenna and the DUT. If the distance of
separation is 2D^2^/lambda based on D being the entire device size, then
the phase variation is 22.5deg. Whether this is the minimum acceptable
criteria of phase taper over the entire DUT is FFS and shall be assessed
during final MU definition for the test method. Any reduction in the
distance of separation increases the phase variation and creates an
error which is DUT dependant. Determination of limit of the error shall
be done during final MU definition for the test method.

#### B.1.1.4.3 Quality of quiet zone

The quality of the quiet zone procedure characterizes the quiet zone
performance of the anechoic chamber, specifically the effect of
reflections within the anechoic chamber including any positioners and
support structures. The MU term additionally includes the amplitude
variations effect of offsetting the directive antenna array inside a DUT
from the centre of the quiet zone as well as the directivity MU, i.e.,
the variation of antenna gains in the different direct line-of-sight
links. An additional MU term related to phase variation and phase ripple
effects which depends on measurement distance is FFS and shall be
assessed during final MU definition for the test method. This might
require an augmentation of the quality of the quiet zone validation
procedure.

#### B.1.1.4.4 Mismatch

Mismatch uncertainty occurs when;

\- Changing the signal path between the measurement and calibration
procedure

\- Evaluating the insertion loss of a signal path

The mismatch uncertainty for a system consisting of a generator, a load
and a component in between is defined as

$\text{Mismatch\ contribution\ }\left( \text{standard\ deviation} \right) = \frac{\left| \Gamma_{\text{generator}} \right| \cdot \left| \Gamma_{\text{load}} \right| \cdot \left| S_{21} \right| \cdot \left| S_{12} \right| \cdot 100}{\sqrt{2} \cdot 11.5}\ \text{dB}$,

Where $\Gamma$ denotes the reflection coefficient and $S_{21}$ is the
transmission coefficient, both in linear voltage ratios.

For a cascade of several components, the interactions between all
components have to be evaluated. For example, for four devices in a row
(shown in Figure B.1.1.4.4-1) the following contributions have to be
accounted for: AB, BC, CD, ABC, BCD, ABCD. The term ABCD represents the
interaction between A and D (generator and load) with the components B
and C in between.

Figure B.1.1.4.4-1: Cascade of components

The combined mismatch uncertainty is given by the root sum square of the
individual contributions:

$combined\ mismatch\ uncertainty = \sqrt{\left( \text{AB} \right)^{2} + \left( \text{BC} \right)^{2} + \left( \text{CD} \right)^{2} + \left( \text{ABC} \right)^{2} + \left( \text{BCD} \right)^{2} + \left( \text{ABCD} \right)^{2}\ }$

In an optimized test procedure, the overall mismatch uncertainty is
smaller when matching pairs of mismatches exist in the calibration and
measurement stage since these pairs cancel each other out. Figure
B.1.1.4.4-2 displays a calibration setup, where device D is replaced by
device F. The mismatch contributions for this path are AB, BC, CE, ABC,
BCE and ABCE. For a result based on the measurement and calibration
stage, the mismatch contributions AB, BC, and ABC are matching pairs as
they occur both in the measurement and calibration stage. Thus, they can
be eliminated \[11\], and the system mismatch uncertainty is obtained as

$\sqrt{\left( \text{CD} \right)^{2} + \left( \text{CE} \right)^{2} + \left( \text{BCD} \right)^{2} + (BC{E)}^{2} + \left( \text{ABCD} \right)^{2} + \left( \text{ABCE} \right)^{2}}$

Figure B.1.1.4.4-2: Sketch of a calibration path

In the following, an example mismatch uncertainty calculation for a
TX/RX patch from the measurement equipment to the measurement antenna is
performed for a frequency of 43.5GHz. The example path under
investigation consists of four SPDT switches, one SP6T switch and one
DPDT switch and microwave cable interconnects with PC2.4 mm connectors.
The attenuation and reflectance of typical components suitable for
frequencies ranging up to 43.5 GHz have been considered in the
calculation of the mismatch uncertainty.

Figure B1.1.4.4-3 shows a sample system setup for an EIRP/EIS test case
with rather simple complexity of the switch box similar to a current FR1
test setup. It should be noted that the switch unit is significantly
less complex than a state-of-the-art switch unit currently used for
conformance tests.

The calculation of the overall mismatch uncertainty for a frequency of
43.5 GHz results in a value of 2.7 dB for the standard deviation, i.e.,
the expanded uncertainty is 5.3 dB.

Figure B.1.1.4.4-4 depicts a possible calibration for a part of the
setup.

![](media/image52.emf){width="6.0in" height="1.9305555555555556in"}

Figure B.1.1.4.4-4: Block Diagram of the calibration stage

For the VNA a return loss of 30 dB is assumed after a full two-port
calibration. The calculation of the system mismatch uncertainty applying
the elimination of matching pairs results in a value of 1.0 dB (standard
deviation) with an expanded value of 1.9 dB.

Since the overall mismatch uncertainty value is already a standard
deviation, which is RSS of values divided by the divisor (√2), the
overall mismatch uncertainty value should be divided by actual divisor 1
when calculating total mismatch.

#### B.1.1.4.5 Absolute antenna gain uncertainty of the measurement antenna

This contribution originates from differences in gain of the calibration
antenna versus the measurement antenna. In practice, the calibration
antenna is used as the measurement antenna so the uncertainty
contribution is 0.00.

#### B.1.1.4.6 Uncertainty of the RF power measurement equipment

The receiving device is used to measure the received signal level in the
EIRP tests as an absolute level. These receiving devices are spectrum
analysers, communication analysers, or power meters. The uncertainty
value will be indicated in the manufacturer\'s data sheet. It needs to
be ensured that appropriate manufacturer\'s uncertainty contributions
are specified for the settings used such as bandwidth and absolute
level. If a power meter is used zero offset, zero drift and measurement
noise need to be included.

#### B.1.1.4.7 Phase curvature

This contribution originates from the finite far field measurement
distance, which causes phase curvature across the antenna of
UE/reference antenna. At a measurement distance of 2D^2^/lambda the
phase curvature is 22.5 degrees. The impact of this factor shall be
assessed during final MU definition for the test method.

#### B.1.1.4.8 Amplifier uncertainties

Any components in the setup can potentially introduce measurement
uncertainty. It is then needed to determine the uncertainty contributors
associated with the use of such components. For the case of external
amplifiers, the following uncertainties should be considered but the
applicability is contingent to the measurement implementation and
calibration procedure.

\- Stability

\- An uncertainty contribution comes from the output level stability of
the amplifier. Even if the amplifier is part of the system for both
measurement and calibration, the uncertainty due to the stability shall
be considered. This uncertainty can be either measured or determined by
the manufacturers' data sheet for the operating conditions in which the
system will be required to operate.

\- Linearity

\- An uncertainty contribution comes from the linearity of the amplifier
since in most cases calibration and measurements are performed at two
different input/output power levels. This uncertainty can be either
measured or determined by the manufacturers' data sheet.

\- Noise Figure

\- When the signal goes into an amplifier, noise is added so that the
SNR at the output is reduced with regard to the SNR of the signal at the
input. This added noise introduces error on the signal which affects the
Error Rate of the receiver thus the EVM (Error Vector Magnitude). An
uncertainty can be calculated through the following formula:

![](media/image53.emf){width="2.013888888888889in"
height="0.3611111111111111in"}

\- Where SNR is the signal to noise ratio in dB at the signal level used
during the sensitivity measurement.

\- Mismatch

\- If the external amplifier is used for both stages, measurement and
calibration the uncertainty contribution associated with it can be
considered systematic and constant -\> 0dB. If it is not the case, the
mismatch uncertainty at its input and output shall be either measured or
determined by the method described in \[12\].

\- Gain

\- If the external amplifier is used for both stages, measurement and
calibration the uncertainty contribution associated with it can be
considered systematic and constant -\> 0dB. If it is not the case, this
uncertainty shall be considered.

#### B.1.1.4.9 Random uncertainty

This contribution is used to account for all the unknown,
unquantifiable, etc. uncertainties associated with the measurements.

Random uncertainty MU contributions are normally distributed. \[Note:
this is different from \"Miscellaneous uncertainty\" or \"Residual
uncertainty\" which can include unknown systematic errors which may not
be normally distributed.\]

The random uncertainty term, by definition, cannot be measured, or even
isolated completely. However, past system definitions provide an
empirical basis for a value. Current LTE SISO OTA measurements have
random uncertainty contributions of \~0.2dB. A value of 0.5dB is
suggested due to increased sensitivity to random effects in more
complex, higher frequency NR test systems.

#### B.1.1.4.10 Influence of the XPD

This factor takes into account the uncertainty caused due to the finite
cross polar discrimination (XPD) between the two polarization ports of
the measurement probe. The XPD of the probe antenna shall be take into
account during final MU definition for the test method..

A typical probe antenna can have XPD of 30dB.

For example if a linearly-polarized sine wave is input to the
measurement antenna with a gradient of 45 degrees like the case in the
following figure, then a signal level of V-antenna and H antenna are
equal.

When we consider a leakage from V to H, or H to V, they can be described
with the following equations.

![](media/image54.emf){width="4.694444444444445in"
height="0.2013888888888889in"}
$ReceivedSignal@Ant\left( V \right) = A \bullet sin\left( 2\pi ft \right) + LeakageComponentFromH$(B.1.1.4.10-1)

$ReceivedSignal@Ant\left( H \right) = A \bullet sin\left( 2\pi ft \right) + LeakageComponentFromV$![](media/image55.emf){width="4.694444444444445in"
height="0.2013888888888889in"} (B.1.1.4.10-2)

Worst case can be assumed as the case that the phase of signal and
leakage are same, and it can be shown as follows

$LeakageComponentFromH = \ A \bullet sin\left( 2\pi ft \right) \bullet 10^{\frac{\text{XPD}}{20}}$![](media/image56.png){width="3.625in"
height="0.2708333333333333in"} (B.1.1.4.10-3)

![](media/image57.png){width="3.6041666666666665in"
height="0.2986111111111111in"} (B.1.1.4.10-4)

If we put equations (3) in (1) and (4) in (2), we get following 2
equations.

![](media/image58.emf){width="3.5416666666666665in"
height="0.3472222222222222in"} (B.1.1.4.10-5)

![](media/image59.emf){width="3.5416666666666665in"
height="0.3680555555555556in"} (B.1.1.4.10-6)

Difference of amplitude between the case that there is a leakage and not
can be calculated as follows.

\- Amplitude when there is not the leakage:
![](media/image60.emf){width="0.1527777777777778in"
height="0.18055555555555555in"}

\- Amplitude when there is the leakage (Worst):
![](media/image61.emf){width="0.9722222222222222in"
height="0.3611111111111111in"}$A \bullet \left( 1 + 10^{\frac{\text{XPD}}{20}} \right)$

![](media/image62.emf){width="4.194444444444445in"
height="0.6944444444444444in"}

For example, if the XPD = -30dB, the calculated value can be as follows.

![](media/image63.emf){width="3.1319444444444446in"
height="0.3541666666666667in"}

#### B.1.1.4.11 Reference antenna positioning misalignment

This contribution originates from reference antenna alignment and
pointing error. In this measurement if the maximum gain directions of
the reference antenna and the receiving antenna are aligned to each
other, this contribution can be considered negligible and therefore set
to zero.

#### B.1.1.4.12 Uncertainty of the Network Analyzer

This contribution originates from all uncertainties involved
transmission magnitude measurement (including drift and frequency
flatness) with a network analyser. The uncertainty value will be
indicated in the manufacturer\'s data sheet. It needs to be ensured that
appropriate manufacturer\'s uncertainty contribution is specified for
the absolute levels measured.

#### B.1.1.4.13 Reference antenna feed cable loss measurement uncertainty

Before performing the calibration, the reference antenna feed cable loss
have to be measured. The measurement can be done with a network analyzer
to measure its S~21~ and uncertainty is introduced. This contribution
should be set as zero.

#### B.1.1.4.14 Uncertainty of an absolute gain of the calibration antenna

The calibration antenna only appears in Stage 2. Therefore, the gain
uncertainty has to be taken into account. This uncertainty will come
from a calibration report with traceability to a National Metrology
Institute with measurement uncertainty budgets generated following the
guidelines outlined in internationally accepted standards.

#### B.1.1.4.15 Positioning and pointing misalignment between the reference antenna and the receiving antenna

This contribution originates from reference antenna alignment and
pointing error. In this measurement if the maximum gain direction of the
reference antenna and the transmitting antenna are aligned to each
other, this contribution can be considered negligible and therefore set
to zero.

#### B.1.1.4.16 gNB emulator uncertainty

gNB emulator is used to drive a signal to the horn antenna (via multiple
external components such as a switch box, an amplifier and a circulator,
etc.) in sensitivity tests either as an absolute level or as a relative
level. Receiving device used is typically a UE/phablet/tablet/FWA.
Generally there occurs uncertainty contribution from absolute level
accuracy, non-linearity and frequency characteristic of the gNB
emulator.

For practical reasons, in a case that a VNA is used as a calibration
equipment, gNB emulator is connected to the system after the calibration
measurement (Stage 2) is performed by the VNA. Hence, the uncertainty on
the absolute level of gNB emulator (transmitter device) cannot be
assumed as systematic. This uncertainty should be calculated from the
manufacturer's data in logs with a rectangular distribution, unless
otherwise informed. Furthermore, the uncertainty of the non-linearity is
included in the absolute level uncertainty.

#### B.1.1.4.17 Phase centre offset of calibration

Gain is defined at the phase centre of the antenna. If the phase centre
of the calibration antenna is not aligned at the centre of the set up
during the calibration, then there will be uncertainty related to the
measurement distance.

The phase centre of a horn antenna moves with frequency along the taper
length of the antenna therefore during the calibration the phase centre
of all frequencies will not be aligned with the setup centre. The
associated uncertainty term can be estimated using the following formula
\[15\]:

![](media/image64.emf){width="1.5416666666666667in"
height="0.5416666666666666in"}

Where d~m~ is the measurement distance and d~p~ is the maximum
positional uncertainty. For a Horn antenna this is equal to 0.5 the
length of the taper. This uncertainty is considered to have a
rectangular distribution so the standard uncertainty is calculated by
dividing the uncertainty by √3.

The same equation applies to log periodic antennas with d~m~ being 0.5
the length of the boom.

For a dipole antenna, given that the phase centre of the antenna is
easily aligned with the centre of the set up the measurement uncertainty
is zero.

If the calibration antenna (i.e. horn) is adjusted during the
calibration to align the phase centre to the setup centre then this
uncertainty term can be considered to be zero.

As an example a horn with a taper length of 50 mm, at 43.5 GHz and a
measurement distance of 72.55 cm the uncertainty term is 0.62, with a
rectangular distribution the standard uncertainty is 0.358 dB.

#### B.1.1.4.18 Quality of quiet zone for calibration process

During the calibration process the calibration antenna will be placed at
the centre of the quiet zone. Therefore, only point P1 from the
procedure outlined in B.1.1.4.3 needs to be considered for the quality
of the quiet zone validation measurement.

For gain calibrations, the standard uncertainty of the EIRP results
obtained following the method outlined in 2.10 shall be used. For
efficiency calibrations, the standard uncertainty of the TRP result
obtained following the method outlined in 2.9 shall be used.

### B.1.3.4 Measurement error contribution descriptions

#### B.1.3.4.1 Positioning misalignment

See B.1.1.4.1

#### B.1.3.4.2 Quality of Quiet Zone

See B.1.1.4.3

#### B.1.3.4.3 Standing wave between DUT and measurement antenna

This value is extracting the uncertainty value and standard deviation of
gain ripple coming from standing waves between DUT and measurement
antenna. This value can be captured by sliding (lambda/4) the DUT
towards the measurement antenna as the standing waves go in and out of
phase causing a ripple in measured gain. DUT scattering/interaction can
also cause standing wave.

#### B.1.3.4.4 Mismatch

See B.1.1.4.4

#### B.1.3.4.5 Insertion loss variation of receiver chain

This uncertainty is the residual uncertainty contribution coming from
introducing an antenna at the end of the cable. If this cable does not
change/move between the calibration Stage 1 and the measurement Stage 2,
the uncertainty is assumed to be systematic and negligible during the
measurement stage.

#### B.1.3.4.6 RF leakage (from measurement antenna to receiver/transmitter)

This contribution denotes noise leaking in to connector and cable(s)
between measurement antenna and receiving/transmitting equipment. The
contribution also includes the noise leakage between the connector and
cable(s) between reference antenna and transmitting equipment for the
calibration phase.

#### B.1.3.4.7 Uncertainty of the RF power measurement equipment

See B.1.1.4.6

#### B.1.3.4.8 Amplifier Uncertainties

#### B.1.3.4.9 Random uncertainty

See B.1.1.4.9.

#### B.1.3.4.10 Influence of XPD

See B.1.1.4.10

#### B.1.3.4.11 Misalignment positioning system

This contribution originates from uncertainty in sliding position and
turn table angle accuracy. If the calibration antenna is aligned to
maximum this contribution can be considered negligible and therefore set
to zero.

#### B.1.3.4.12 Uncertainty of Network Analyzer

See B.1.1.4.12.

#### B.1.3.4.13 Uncertainty of the absolute gain of the calibration antenna

See B.1.1.4.14.

#### B.1.3.4.14 Influence of the calibration antenna feed cable (Flexing cables, adapters, attenuators, connector repeatability)

During the calibration phase this cable is used to feed the calibration
antenna (SGH) and any influence it may have upon the measurements is
captured. This is assessed by repeated measurements while flexing the
cables and rotary joints. The largest difference between the results is
recorded as the uncertainty.

#### B.1.3.4.15 Positioning and pointing misalignment between the reference antenna and the receiving antenna

See B.1.1.4.15

#### B.1.3.4.16 Standing wave between reference calibration antenna and measurement antenna

This value is extracting the uncertainty value and standard deviation of
gain ripple coming from standing waves between SGH and measurement
antenna. This value can be captured by sliding (lambda/4) the SGH
towards the measurement antenna as the standing waves go in and out of
phase causing a ripple in measured gain. SGH scattering/interaction can
also cause standing wave.

#### B.1.3.4.17 gNB emulator uncertainty

B.1.4 NFTF setup
----------------

> B.1.4.1 Uncertainty budget calculation principle

The uncertainty tables should be presented with two stages:

\- Stage 1: the calibration of the absolute level of the DUT measurement
results is performed by means of using a calibration antenna whose
absolute gain is known at the frequencies of measurement

\- Stage 2: the actual measurement with the DUT as either the
transmitter or receiver is performed.

The MU budget should comprise of a minimum 5 headings:

1\) The uncertainty source,

2\) Uncertainty value,

3\) Distribution of the probability,

4\) Divisor based on distribution shape,

5\) Calculated standard uncertainty (based on uncertainty value and

### B.1.4.4 Measurement error contribution descriptions

#### B.1.4.4.1 Axes Alignment

Includes the following mechanical alignment errors:

\- The uncertainty related with the lateral displacement between the
horizontal and vertical axes of the DUT positioner.

\- The differences from 90° of the angle between the horizontal and
vertical axes.

\- The horizontal mis-pointing of the horizontal axis to the probe
reference point for Theta=0°.

These mechanical errors can result in sampling the field on a non-ideal
sphere. This uncertainty can be considered to have a normal
distribution.

#### B.1.4.4.2 Probe XPD

Refer to B.1.1.4.10 \[7\]. If the Probe Polarization Amplitude and Phase
is measured and corrected for then this uncertainty term can be
considered to be zero.

#### B.1.4.4.3 Probe Polarization Amplitude and Phase

The amplitude and phase of the probe polarization coefficients should be
measured. This uncertainty is assumed to have a normal distribution.

#### B.1.4.4.4 Probe Array Uniformity (for multi -probe systems only)

This is the uncertainty due to the fact that different probes are used
for each physical position. Different probes have different radiation
patterns. Generally, the probe array is calibrated so that the
uniformity of the probes is achieved. This uncertainty term must be
considered if the amplitude and phase of each probe is not identical or
corrected for. This uncertainty is assumed to have a normal distribution

#### B.1.4.4.5 Probe Pattern Effect

The probe/s pattern/s is assumed to be known so that the DUT measurement
in near field can be corrected when performing the near field to far
field transform. If the probe pattern is known, then the uncertainty
term is zero. There is no direct dependence between the DUT pattern and
the probe pattern in near field measurements. This uncertainty is
assumed to have a normal distribution.

#### B.1.4.4.6 Multiple Reflections: Coupling Measurement Antenna and DUT

The multiple reflections occur when a portion of the transmitted signal
is reflected form the receiving antenna back to the transmitting antenna
and re-reflected by the transmitting antenna back to the receiving
antenna. This uncertainty can be determined by multiple measurements of
the DUT when at different distance from the probes. This uncertainty is
assumed to have a normal distribution.

#### B.1.4.4.7 Quality of the Quiet Zone

See B.1.1.4.3

#### B.1.4.4.8 Measurement Distance

See B.1.1.4.2

#### B.1.4.4.9 NF to FF truncation

The measured near field is expanded using a finite set of spherical
modes. The number of modes is linked to number of samples. The filtering
effect generated by the finite number of modes can improve measurement
results by removing signals from outside the physical area of the DUT.
Care must be taken in order to make sure the removed signals are not
from the DUT itself. This term also includes the uncertainty related to
the scan area truncation. This uncertainty is usually negligible. This
uncertainty is assumed to have a normal distribution.

#### B.1.4.4.10 Mismatch of receiver chain

See B.1.1.4.4

#### B.1.4.4.11 Uncertainty of the RF power measurement equipment

See B.1.1.4.6.

#### B.1.4.4.12 Amplifier uncertainties

See B.1.1.4.8

#### B.1.4.4.13 Phase Recovery Non-Linearity over signal bandwidth

This uncertainty originates from the non-linearity of the phase recovery
for wide band signal. The phase recovery can be due to either phase
non-linearity of the receiver and/or the DUT itself. The method to
quantify the non-linarites is not defined.

#### B.1.4.4.14 Phase Drift and Noise

This uncertainty is due to the noise level and drift of the test range
and should be determined or measured at the DUT location. The noise
level is usually measured with a Spectrum Analyzer. This uncertainty is
assumed to have a normal distribution.

#### B.1.4.4.15 Leakage and Crosstalk

This uncertainty can be addressed by measurements on the actual system
setup. The leakage and crosstalk cannot be separated from the random
amplitude and phase errors so that the relative importance should be
determined. This uncertainty is assumed to have a normal distribution.

#### B.1.4.4.16 Random uncertainty

See B.1.1.4.9

#### B.1.4.4.17 Uncertainty of the Network Analyzer

See B.1.1.4.12

#### B.1.4.4.18 Amplifier Uncertainties

See B.1.1.4.8

#### B.1.4.4.19 Mismatch of receiver chain

See B.1.1.4.4

#### B.1.4.4.20 Mismatch in the connection of the calibration antenna

See B.1.1.4.4

#### B.1.4.4.21 Measurement Distance

See B.1.1.4.17

#### B.1.4.4.22 Quality of the Quiet Zone for Calibration Process

See B.1.1.4.18

#### B.1.4.4.23 Uncertainty of the absolute gain of the calibration antenna

See B.1.1.4.5.

#### B.1.4.4.24 Phase curvature

See B.1.1.4.7

B.2 Measurement uncertainty budget for UE RRM testing methodology
=================================================================

B.2.1 Direct far field (DFF) setup
----------------------------------

B.2.1.1 Uncertainty budget calculation principle

The uncertainty tables cover the actual measurement using the DUT. In
some cases, uncertainty may also arise from a calibration or alignment
process before the measurements.

When a calibration process is used before the measurements, the
uncertainty tables should be presented with two stages:

\- Stage 1: the calibration of the absolute level of the DUT measurement
results is performed by means of using a calibration antenna whose
absolute gain is known at the frequencies of measurement

\- Stage 2: the actual measurement with the DUT as either the
transmitter or receiver is performed.

The MU budget should comprise of a minimum 5 headings:

1\) The uncertainty source,

2\) Uncertainty value,

3\) Distribution of the probability,

4\) Divisor based on distribution shape,

5\) Calculated standard uncertainty (based on uncertainty value and
divisor).

B.2.1.2 Uncertainty budget format

The uncertainty contributions depend on the parameter being controlled
and/or the measurement being made. A separate table is provided for
each.

B.2.1.3 Uncertainty assessment

The uncertainty assessment tables are organized as follows:

> \- For the purpose of uncertainty assessment, the radiating antenna
> aperture of the DUT is denoted as D, and the uncertainty assessment
> has been derived for the case of D = 5 cm

The uncertainty contributions depend on the parameter being controlled
and/or the measurement being made. A separate table is provided for
each.

### B.2.1.5 Assessment of testable SNR range for D=5cm

The signal and the noise provided by the test system are both attenuated
by the over-the-air link loss. The UE noise then adds to the noise
provided by the test system, hence degrading the SNR seen by the UE and
potentially limiting the testable SNR range.

For conducted tests, the noise provided by the test system can be set
much higher than the UE noise and the SNR degradation is negligible.
However for over-the-air test systems, the power that can realistically
be delivered into the test system probe antenna is limited, so the test
point is likely to be closer to the UE noise and a small SNR degradation
is allowable.

#### B.2.1.5.1 Method and Parameters

The initial rational in this clause is elaborated for Scenario 1 (1
Angle of Arrival with signal coming from the RX beam peak direction) for
Type 1 Requirements (\"Fine\" RX beam) and Mode 1 Configuration (TE
generating S and N).

For RRM tests, DL SNR is given as a test parameter. Such SNR environment
is generated by the test system by injecting both desired signal and
artificial AWGN noise. To fulfil the purpose of the test, the configured
SNR should be accurate enough at the UE receiver. If the absolute power
level of the signal and noise from the test system is too low, then the
SNR would be degraded due to the UE's internal noise.

The calculation of Noc level is shown in clause 6.2.1.4.

The possible transmitted signal and noise strengths from the test
antenna depend on the capability of the test system. The feasible
transmit power depends on the conducted cable losses, the Test system
transmit antenna gain and the final amplifier characteristic, especially
the P1dB compression point. Considering the cable losses, probe antenna
gain of 12dB and commercially available mmWave Amplifiers, and the crest
factor of the downlink signal (not to cause additional EVM error from
test system side), the feasible transmit power from the probe antenna is
calculated below, which in turn sets the SNR range.

Table B.2.1.5.1-1: Assumed Test system parameters

                           43GHz   
  ------------------------ ------- -----

  Backoff from P1dB        -13     dB
  Cable loss               -8      dB
  Probe antenna gain       12      dB
  Transmission bandwidth   100M    Hz

The third part to consider is the free space path loss between the probe
antenna and the UE antenna, shown below:

B.2.1.5.4 SNR range for SNR~RP~ - SNR~BB~ ≤ 1dB

The initial rational in this clause is elaborated for Scenario 1 (1
Angle of Arrival with signal coming from the RX beam peak direction) for
Type 1 Requirements (\"Fine\" RX beam) and Mode 1 Configuration (TE
generating S and N).

Based on the method of setting the noise from the Test system to give a
maximum of 1dB degradation in overall SNR between reference point and
baseband, we can then work back through the signal chain to determine
how high the SNR can be set. As the noise is set to a fixed level, the
maximum SNR is set by the test system power amplifier and the channel
bandwidth to be tested.

The SNR upper bound depends on the type of test system. For the Direct
far field (DFF) setup the diagram below illustrates the principle, and
is based on the \"DFF 100MHz\" tab of the accompanying spreadsheet.

The process works back through the signal chain, from left to right in
the diagram.

Figure B.2.1.5.4-1: Estimation of multi band UE SNR range for Direct far
field (DFF), fine beam, Rx Beam peak direction

The test equipment must supply at least the wanted noise level at the
reference point. If the noise was lower, the degradation in SNR would be
greater than 1dB, and may cause a conformant UE to fail.

The accuracy of setting the signal and noise levels has been taken as
+/-\[6.0\]dB. It is subject to further analysis by RAN5.

During conformance test, the test system will need to find the UE Rx
beam peak. At present an allowance of \[0.5\] dB has been included, but
is subject to further analysis by RAN5.

An allowance of 2 dB has been made for UE multi-band relaxation factor
∑MBp from Table 6.2.1.3-4 of TS 38.101-2 \[16\].

Inclusion of these three contributions directly reduces the maximum SNR
that can be measured by a test system for a given channel bandwidth. To
find the maximum SNR that can be measured by a test system with a
specific Channel BW, the baseband SNR in the spreadsheet is increased
until the value \"Wanted signal + headroom, dBm/Ch BW\" is just below
the \"TE Power amplifier 1dB compression, dBm\" value. The resulting
values are given in Table B.2.1.5.4-1.

Note that these are UE baseband SNR values, so the Reference point
figures used in RRM test cases may be 1dB higher. Values are based on UE
parameters and currently foreseen test equipment limitations, and could
be improved in future.

An example of SNR calculation for DFF method is provided in
\"Spreadsheet 1 - RRM SNR range calculator.xls\" file attached to the
TR.

### B.2.2.3 Uncertainty assessment

The uncertainty assessment tables are organized as follows:

\- For the purpose of uncertainty assessment, the radiating antenna
aperture of the DUT is denoted as D, and the uncertainty assessment has
been derived for the case of D = 15 cm

The uncertainty contributions depend on the parameter being controlled
and/or the measurement being made. A separate table is provided for
each.

#### B.2.1.4.3 gNB emulator fading model impairments

See B.3.1.4.3

### B.2.2.5 Assessment of testable SNR range

The signal and the noise provided by the test system are both attenuated
by the over-the-air link loss. The UE noise then adds to the noise
provided by the test system, hence degrading the SNR seen by the UE and
potentially limiting the testable SNR range.

For conducted tests, the noise provided by the test system can be set
much higher than the UE noise and the SNR degradation is negligible.
However for over-the-air test systems, the power that can realistically
be delivered into the test system probe antenna is limited, so the test
point is likely to be closer to the UE noise and a small SNR degradation
is allowable.

#### B.2.2.5.1 Method and Parameters

The method is the same as B.2.1.5.1, but the values related to the test
system are different. The calculation of noise level is in clause
6.2.1.4.3, 6.2.1.4.4, 6.2.1.4.5 and 6.2.1.4.6.

B.2.2.5.4 SNR range for SNR~RP~ - SNR~BB~ ≤ 1dB

The initial rational in this clause is elaborated for Scenario 1 (1
Angle of Arrival with signal coming from the RX beam peak direction) for
Type 1 Requirements (\"Fine\" RX beam) and Mode 1 Configuration (TE
generating S and N).

Based on the method of setting the noise from the Test system to give a
maximum of 1dB degradation in overall SNR between reference point and
baseband, we can then work back through the signal chain to determine
how high the SNR can be set. As the noise is set to a fixed level, the
maximum SNR is set by the test system power amplifier and the channel
bandwidth to be tested.

The SNR upper bound depends on the type of test system. For the Indirect
Far field (IFF) setup the diagram below illustrates the principle, and
is based on the \"IFF 100MHz\" tab of the accompanying spreadsheet.

The process works back through the signal chain, from left to right in
the diagram.

Figure B.2.2.5.4-1: Estimation of multi band UE SNR range for Indirect
far field (IFF), fine beam, Rx Beam peak direction

The test equipment must supply at least the wanted noise level at the
reference point. If the noise was lower, the degradation in SNR would be
greater than 1dB, and may cause a conformant UE to fail.

The accuracy of setting the signal and noise levels has been taken as
+/-\[6.0\]dB. The uncertainty is subject to further analysis by RAN5.

During conformance test, the test system will need to find the UE Rx
beam peak. At present an allowance of \[0.5\] dB has been included, but
is subject to further analysis by RAN5.

An allowance of 2 dB has been made for UE multi-band relaxation factor
∑MBp from Table 6.2.1.3-4 of TS 38.101-2 \[16\].

Inclusion of these three contributions directly reduces the maximum SNR
that can be measured by a test system for a given channel bandwidth. To
find the maximum SNR that can be measured by a test system with a
specific Channel BW, the baseband SNR in the spreadsheet is increased
until the value \"Wanted signal + headroom, dBm/Ch BW\" is just below
the \"TE Power amplifier 1dB compression, dBm\" value. The resulting
values are given in Table B.2.2.5.4-1.

  Spherical coverage   Fine        24              \[10.1dB\]
                                   66              \[5.1dB\]
                       Rough       24              \[1.5dB\]
                                   66              Not usable

Note that these are UE baseband SNR values, so the Reference point
figures used in RRM test cases may be 1dB higher. Values are based on UE
parameters and currently foreseen test equipment limitations, and could
be improved in future.

B.2.3.3 Uncertainty assessment

The uncertainty assessment tables are organized as follows:

\- For the purpose of uncertainty assessment, the radiating antenna
aperture of the DUT is denoted as D, and the uncertainty assessment has
been derived for the case of D = 5 cm

The uncertainty contributions depend on the parameter being controlled
and/or the measurement being made. A separate table is provided for
each.

B.2.3.5 Assessment of testable SNR range for D=5cm

The signal and the noise provided by the test system are both attenuated
by the over-the-air link loss. The UE noise then adds to the noise
provided by the test system, hence degrading the SNR seen by the UE and
potentially limiting the testable SNR range.

For conducted tests, the noise provided by the test system can be set
much higher than the UE noise and the SNR degradation is negligible.
However for over-the-air test systems, the power that can realistically
be delivered into the test system probe antenna is limited, so the test
point is likely to be closer to the UE noise and a small SNR degradation
is allowable.

B.3 Measurement uncertainty budget for UE demodulation testing methodology
==========================================================================

B.3.1 Direct near field (DNF) setup
-----------------------------------

### B.3.1.1 Uncertainty budget calculation principle

The uncertainty tables cover the actual measurement using the DUT
receiver. If applicable, any uncertainty arising from a calibration or
alignment process before the measurements should also be included.

The MU budget should comprise of a minimum 5 headings:

1\) The uncertainty source,

2\) Uncertainty value,

3\) Distribution of the probability,

4\) Divisor based on distribution shape,

5\) Calculated standard uncertainty (based on uncertainty value and
divisor).

### B.3.1.4 Measurement error contribution descriptions

#### B.3.1.4.1 gNB emulator SNR uncertainty

This contribution originates from setting the ratio of signal and noise
in the conducted part of the test system. It is estimated to be the same
as for LTE conducted testing in TS 36.521-1 Annex F, which is ±0.3dB.
The default for values in 36.521-1 Annex F is 95% confidence interval,
normal distribution.

#### B.3.1.4.2 gNB emulator Downlink EVM

When simulations of demodulation performance are run, the downlink
signal is modelled with a defined EVM, representing imperfections in the
signal transmitted by the gNB. This EVM value is agreed across companies
to align simulations, and is normally lower than the gNB EVM
requirement, to represent \"typical\" conditions. The EVM used for
simulations is therefore built in to the requirement points, normally
specified as the SNR required to meet a specified throughput, with a
defined modulation and Reference channel, under defined propagation
conditions.

For a conformance test, the EVM defined for the simulations is taken as
a maximum allowed value for the test system, as a worse gNB emulator EVM
would make the signal harder to demodulate, and disadvantage the UE. In
a test system the EVM cannot normally be set to a specific value, but is
specified to be no higher than a defined value.

Following this approach, the uncertainty from gNB emulator Downlink EVM
is a one-sided distribution, with beneficial effect. Without treating
the positive and negative uncertainties separately, and as it would not
make the SNR worse, the effective uncertainty is 0dB.

#### B.3.1.4.3 gNB emulator fading model impairments

This contribution originates from imperfections in the gNB emulator
fading model, compared to the applied fading model. It is estimated to
be the same as for LTE conducted testing in TS 36.521-1 Annex F, which
is ±0.5dB. The default for values in 36.521-1 Annex F is 95% confidence
interval, normal distribution.

### B.3.1.5 Assessment of testable DL SNR range and accuracy for D=15cm

The signal and the noise provided by the test system are both attenuated
by the over-the-air link loss. The UE noise then adds to the noise
provided by the test system, hence degrading the SNR seen by the UE and
potentially limiting the testable SNR range. The calculations and graphs
in this clause allow this SNR degradation to be assessed over a range of
scenarios.

For conducted tests, the noise provided by the test system can be set
much higher than the UE noise and the SNR degradation is negligible.
However for over-the-air test systems, the power that can realistically
be delivered into the test system probe antenna is limited, so the test
point is likely to be closer to the UE noise and a small SNR degradation
is allowable.

#### B.3.1.5.1 Method and Parameters

The method is the same as B.2.1.5.1, but some values related to the test
system are different, and provided in Table B.3.1.5.1-1. The calculation
of noise level is in clause 7.2.1.3.

B.3.1.5.4 SNR range for SNR~RP~ - SNR~BB~ ≤ 1dB

Based on the method of setting the noise from the Test system to give a
maximum of 1dB degradation in overall SNR between reference point and
baseband, we can then work back through the signal chain to determine
how high the SNR can be set. As the noise is set to a fixed level, the
maximum SNR is set by the test system power amplifier and the channel
bandwidth to be tested.

The SNR upper bound depends on the type of test system. For the Direct
Near field (DNF) setup the diagram below illustrates the principle, and
is based on the \"DNF 100MHz\" tab of the accompanying spreadsheet.

The process works back through the signal chain, from left to right in
the diagram.

Figure B.3.1.5.4-1: Estimation of single band UE SNR range for Direct
near field (DNF)

The test equipment must supply at least the wanted noise level at the
reference point. If the noise was lower, the degradation in SNR would be
greater than 1dB, and may cause a conformant UE to fail.

The accuracy of setting the signal and noise levels has been taken as
+/-\[6.0\]dB. The uncertainty is subject to further analysis by RAN5.

During conformance test, the test system will need to find the UE Rx
beam peak. At present an allowance of \[0.5\] dB has been included, but
is subject to further analysis by RAN5.

Inclusion of these two contributions directly reduces the maximum SNR
that can be measured by a test system for a given channel bandwidth. To
find the maximum SNR that can be measured by a test system with a
specific Channel BW, the baseband SNR in the spreadsheet is increased
until the value \"Wanted signal + headroom, dBm/Ch BW\" is just below
the \"TE Power amplifier 1dB compression, dBm\" value. The resulting
values are given in Table B.3.1.5.4-1. Single band UE values are
obtained by setting the UE multi-band relaxation factor to 0 dB.

Note that these are UE baseband SNR values, so the Reference point
figures used in TS 38.101-4 \[18\] will be 1 dB higher. Values are based
on UE parameters and currently foreseen test equipment limitations, and
could be improved in future.

Note that for the DNF method, values may need to be adjusted to take
account of near-field effects.

B.3.2 Direct far field (DFF) setup
----------------------------------

The Measurement uncertainty contributions and uncertainty assessment are
expected to be the same as for the Direct near field (DNF) setup in
B.3.1.

### B.3.2.5 Assessment of testable SNR range

The signal and the noise provided by the test system are both attenuated
by the over-the-air link loss. The UE noise then adds to the noise
provided by the test system, hence degrading the SNR seen by the UE and
potentially limiting the testable SNR range.

For conducted tests, the noise provided by the test system can be set
much higher than the UE noise and the SNR degradation is negligible.
However for over-the-air test systems, the power that can realistically
be delivered into the test system probe antenna is limited, so the test
point is likely to be closer to the UE noise and a small SNR degradation
is allowable.

#### B.3.2.5.1 Method and Parameters

The method and parameters are the same as B.2.1.5.1. The calculation of
noise level is in clause 7.2.1.3.

B.3.3 Indirect far field (IFF) setup
------------------------------------

### B.3.3.1 Uncertainty budget calculation principle

The uncertainty tables cover the actual measurement using the DUT
receiver. If applicable, any uncertainty arising from a calibration or
alignment process before the measurements should also be included.

The MU budget should comprise of a minimum 5 headings:

1\) The uncertainty source,

2\) Uncertainty value,

3\) Distribution of the probability,

4\) Divisor based on distribution shape,

5\) Calculated standard uncertainty (based on uncertainty value and
divisor).

### B.3.3.5 Assessment of testable SNR range

The Assessment of testable SNR range follows the same principle as
B.3.1.5, but the values related to the test system are different and
provide a different testable SNR range.

#### B.3.3.5.1 Method and Parameters

The method is the same as B.2.1.5.1, but the values related to the test
system are different. The calculation of noise level is in clause
7.2.1.3.

#### B.3.3.5.2 Void

#### B.3.3.5.3 Void

#### B.3.3.5.4 SNR range for SNR~RP~ - SNR~BB~ ≤ 1dB

Based on the method of setting the noise from the Test system to give a
maximum of 1dB degradation in overall SNR between reference point and
baseband, we can then work back through the signal chain to determine
how high the SNR can be set. As the noise is set to a fixed level, the
maximum SNR is set by the test system power amplifier and the channel
bandwidth to be tested.

The SNR upper bound depends on the type of test system. For the Indirect
Far field (IFF) setup the diagram below illustrates the principle, and
is based on the \"IFF 100MHz\" tab of the accompanying spreadsheet.

The process works back through the signal chain, from left to right in
the diagram.

Figure B.3.3.5.4-1: Estimation of single band UE SNR range for Indirect
far field (IFF)

The test equipment must supply at least the wanted noise level at the
reference point. If the noise was lower, the degradation in SNR would be
greater than 1dB, and may cause a conformant UE to fail.

The accuracy of setting the signal and noise levels has been taken as
+/-\[6.0\]dB. The uncertainty is subject to further analysis by RAN5.

During conformance test, the test system will need to find the UE Rx
beam peak. At present an allowance of \[0.5\] dB has been included, but
is subject to further analysis by RAN5.

Inclusion of these two contributions directly reduces the maximum SNR
that can be measured by a test system for a given channel bandwidth. To
find the maximum SNR that can be measured by a test system with a
specific Channel BW, the baseband SNR in the spreadsheet is increased
until the value \"Wanted signal + headroom, dBm/Ch BW\" is just below
the \"TE Power amplifier 1dB compression, dBm\" value. The resulting
values are given in Table B.3.3.5.4-1. Single band UE values are
obtained by setting the UE multi-band relaxation factor to 0 dB.

  Note: For ∑MBp from TS 38.101-2 \[16\] Table 6.2.1.3-4 allow up to 2 dB                       

Note that these are UE baseband SNR values, so the Reference point
figures used in TS 38.101-4 \[18\] will be 1 dB higher. Values are based
on UE parameters and currently foreseen test equipment limitations, and
could be improved in future.

An example of SNR calculation for IFF method is provided in
\"Spreadsheet 2 - Demod SNR range calculator.xls\" file attached to the
TR.

########  Annex C: UE coordinate system

C.1 Reference coordinate system
===============================

This annex defines the measurement coordinate system for the NR UE. The
reference coordinate system as defined in \[20\] is provided in Figure
C.1-1 below while Figure C.1.-2 shows the DUT in the default alignment,
i.e., the DUT and the reference coordinate systems are aligned with α =
0^o^ and β = 0^o^ and γ = 0^o^ where α, β, and γ describe the relative
angles between the two coordinate systems.

height="3.1458333333333335in"}

Figure C.1-2: DUT default alignment to coordinate system

The following aspects are necessary:

\- A basic understanding of the top and bottom of the device is needed
in order to define unambiguous DUT positioning requirements for the
test, e.g., in the drawings used in this annex, the three buttons are on
the bottom of the device (front) and the camera is on the top of the
device (back).

\- An understanding of the origin and alignment the coordinate system
inside the test system, i.e. the directions in which the x, y, z axes
point inside the test chamber, is needed in order to define unambiguous
DUT orientation, DUT beam, signal, interference, and measurement angles.

C.2 Test conditions and angle definitions
=========================================

Tables C.2-1 through C.2-3 below provide the test conditions and angle
definitions for three permitted device alignment for the default test
condition, DUT orientation 1, and two different options for each
permitted device alignment to re-position the device for DUT Orientation
2 as outlined in Figures C.2-1 and C.2-3.

For each UE requirement and test case, each of the parameters in Tables
C.2-1 through C.2-3 need to be recorded, such that DUT positioning, DUT
beam direction, and angles of the signal, link/interferer, and
measurement are specified in terms of the fixed coordinate system.

Due to the non-commutative nature of rotations, the order of rotations
is important and needs to be defined when multiple DUT orientations are
tested.

The rotations around the x, y, and z axes can be defined with the
following rotation matrices

![](media/image81.wmf)

![](media/image82.wmf)

and

![](media/image83.wmf).

with the respective angles of rotation, *α*, *β*, *γ* and

![](media/image84.wmf)

Additionally, any translation of the DUT can be defined with the
translation matrix

![](media/image85.wmf)

with offsets t~x~, t~y~, t~z~ in x, y, and z, respectively and with

![](media/image86.wmf)

The combination of rotations and translation is captured by the
multiplication of rotation and translation matrices.

For instance, the matrix M

![](media/image87.png){width="2.611111111111111in" height="0.3125in"}

describes an initial rotation of the DUT around the x axis with angle
*α*, a subsequent rotation around the y axis with angle *β*, and a final
rotation around the z axis with angle *γ*. After those rotations, the
DUT is translated by t~x~, t~y~, t~z~ in x, y, and z, respectively.

C.3 DUT positioning guidelines
==============================

The centre of the reference coordinate system shall be aligned with the
geometric centre of the DUT in order to minimize the offset between
antenna arrays integrated at any position of the UE and the centre of
the quiet zone.

Near-field coupling effects between the antenna and the
pedestals/positioners/fixtures generally cause increased signal ripples.
Re-positioning the DUT by directing the beam peak away from those areas
can reduce the effect of signal ripple on EIRP/EIS measurements. Figure
C.3-1 and C.3-2 illustrate how to reposition the DUT in distributed axes
and combined axes system, when the beam peak is directed to the DUTs
upper hemisphere (DUT orientation 1) or the DUTs lower hemisphere (DUT
orientation 2). While these figures are examples of different
positioning systems and other implementations are not precluded, the
relative orientation of the coordinate system with respect to the
antennas/reflectors and the axes of rotation shall apply to any
measurement setup.

Figure C.3-2: DUT re-positioning for an example of combined-axes system

For EIRP/EIS measurements, re-positioning the DUT makes sure the
pedestal is not obstructing the beam path and that the pedestal is not
in closer proximity to the measurement antenna/reflector than the DUT.
For TRP measurements, re-positioning the DUT makes sure that the beam
peak direction is not obstructed by the pedestal and the pedestal is in
the measurement path only when measuring the back-hemisphere. No
re-positioning during the TRP measurement is required.

########  Annex D: Quality of the quiet zone validation

D.1 General
===========

This annex describes the procedures for validating the quality of the
quiet zone for the permitted far-field methods outlined in clause 5.2.1
(DFF), in clause 5.2.2 (simplified DFF), and in clause 5.2.3 (IFF).

D.2 Procedure to characterize the quality of the quiet zone for the permitted far field methods
===============================================================================================

This procedure is mandatory before the test system is commissioned for
certification tests and characterizes the quiet zone performance of the
anechoic chamber, specifically the effect of reflections within the
anechoic chamber including any positioners and support structures.
Additionally, it includes the effect of offsetting the directive antenna
array inside a DUT from the centre of the quiet zone, i.e., the centre
of rotation of the DUT and measurement antenna positioning systems as
well as the directivity MU, i.e., the variation of antenna gains in the
different direct line-of-sight links.

The quiet zone is illustrated in Figure D.2-1 which includes the
definitions of centre of quiet zone range, i.e., the geometric centre of
the positioning systems, and the range length, i.e., the distance
between the centre of the quiet zone and the aperture of the measurement
antenna.

Figure D.2-1: Quiet Zone Illustration

The outcome of the procedures can be used to predict the

\- variation of the TRP measurements, spherical surface integrals of
EIRP/EIS, when the DUT is placed anywhere within the quiet zone and with
the beam formed in any arbitrary direction inside the chamber

\- variation of the EIRP/EIS measurements when the DUT is placed
anywhere within the quiet zone and with the beam formed in any arbitrary
direction inside the chamber

The reference coordinate system defined in Appendix C applies to this
procedure.

D.2.1 Equipment used
--------------------

The reference antenna under test (AUT) that is placed at various
locations within the quiet zone shall be a directive antenna with
similar properties of typical antenna arrays integrated in DUTs. The
characteristics in terms of Directivity and Half Power Beamwidth (HPBW)
of the reference AUT are shown in Figure D.2.1-1, D.2.1-2, and D.2.1-3.

Figure D.2.1-3: 2xHPBW-H mask

AUT shall be symmetric on E and H planes.

The above masks for the reference antenna are met based on antenna
vendors' calibration report.

For the measurement, a combination of signal generator and spectrum
analyser or a network analyser can be used. The multi-port (with three
ports) network analyser is most suitable to reduce test time as both
polarizations of the measurement antenna can be measured simultaneously
and multiple frequencies can be measured in a sweep.

D.2.2 Test frequencies
----------------------

The frequencies to be used to characterize the quality of the quiet zone
shall be identified during final test method definition in RAN5 WG. The
quiet zone validation analysis is performed for each frequency
individually.

D.2.3 Reference measurements
----------------------------

The quality of the quiet measurements for integrated RF parameters such
as TRP shall use 3D pattern measurements of the reference antenna
patterns as they most closely resemble the 3D/spherical surface
measurements/integrals of EIRP or EIS. Therefore, the quality of the
quiet zone measurements for TRP metrics shall be based on efficiency
measurements. On the other hand, the quality of the quiet zone
measurements for single-directional EIRP and EIS metrics shall be based
on gain measurements of the direct line-of-sight link between the
reference AUT and the measurement antenna.

The grid types for the TRP measurements shall match those outlined in
G.1.2 and the minimum number of grid points (including quadratures for
constant step size grids and implementation of constant density grids)
shall meet the 0.25 dB maximum standard uncertainty summarized in G.1.4.

D.2.4 Size of the quiet zone
----------------------------

The size of the quiet zone within which the variations of measurements
are evaluated depends on the size of the DUT. For smartphones, the quiet
zone shall be considered a sphere with radius of R=7.5cm. . For larger
smartphones and tablet type devices, the quiet zone shall be considered
a sphere with radius of R=15cm. Alternate quiet zone sizes can be
defined for even larger DUTs.

The quality of quiet zone procedure for systems supporting larger quiet
zone sizes can be performed for the largest quiet zone radius only and
the results can be applied to the smaller quiet zone radius. Performing
separate sets of quality of quiet zone measurements for different radii
is not precluded.

D.2.5 Minimum range length
--------------------------

The minimum range length depends on the size of the DUT and the minimum
far-field distance of typical antenna arrays integrated in DUTs.

D.2.6 Reference AUT positions
-----------------------------

The reference AUT shall be positioned in a total of 7 different
reference positions, shown in Figure D.2.6.1-1 and D.2.6.2-1

While position 1, P1, is the centre of the quiet zone, the remaining
positions, 2 through 7, are off-centre positions each displaced by the
radius of the quiet zone, R. The coordinates of the respective test
points are shown in Table D.2.6-1.

### D.2.6.1 Distributed-axes system

The reference AUT shall be positioned in a total of 7 different
reference positions, shown in Figure D.2.6.1-1.

system

D.2.7 Reference AUT orientations
--------------------------------

As different areas within the chamber could yield variations in the
field uniformity inside the quiet zone caused by reflections, it is
important to characterize the electromagnetic fields with the reference
antennas uniformly illuminating the anechoic chamber.

### D.2.7.1 Distributed-axes system

In order to keep the quality of the quiet zone characterization
manageable in terms of test times, it is suggested to perform the
reference measurements for the reference AUT placed at the 7 antenna
positions with the antenna rotated around the y axis with 5 different
angles *β*, i.e., *β* = 0^o^, 45^o^, 90^o^, 135^o^, and 180^o^, and
rotated around the z axis with 8 different *γ * = 0^o^, 45^o^, 90^o^,
135^o^, 180^o^, 225^o^, 270^o^, and 315^o^. A graphical illustration of
the some sample reference AUT orientations is shown in Figure D.2.7.1-1
with a reference AUT placed at position 6, P6, for reference antenna
polarization *γ*~pol~ = 0^o^; Figure D.2.7.1-2 illustrates the reference
AUT orientations for the reference polarization *γ*~pol~ = 90^o^.

The matrix operation for the rotations and translation is defined as

for the distributed-axes system.

Figure D.2.7.1-2: Sample reference AUT orientations for position 6, P6,
for reference antenna polarization γ~pol~ = 90^o^.

When facing the z-axis, *β* = 0^o^ and *β* = 180^o^, the antenna does
not need to be evaluated for the 8 different rotations around the z
axis. A single orientation is sufficient since those orientations are
unique. Due to the pedestal, distributed-axes systems are not able to
measure towards the *β* =180^o^ direction; for those systems, the
reference measurements at this reference AUT orientation can be skipped.

If the device re-positioning approach outlined in Annex C.3 is adopted
for the EIRP/EIS/TRP based conformance test cases, the quality of quiet
zone analysis is sufficient only for *β * = 0^o^, 45^o^, 90^o^~.~

### D.2.7.2 Combined-axes system

In order to keep the quality of the quiet zone characterization
manageable in terms of test times, it is suggested to perform the
reference measurements for the reference AUT placed at the 7 antenna
positions with the antenna rotated around the x axis with 5 different
angles α, i.e., α = -90^o^, -45^o^, 0^o^, 45^o^, and 90^o^ and rotated
around the y axis with 8 different angles *β* = 0^o^, 45^o^, 90^o^,
135^o^, 180^o^, 225^o^, 270^o^, and 315^o^. A graphical illustration of
some sample reference AUT orientations is shown in Figure D.2.7.2-1 with
a reference AUT placed at position 4, P4, for reference antenna
polarization *γ*~pol~ = 0^o^; Figure D.2.7.2-2 illustrates the reference
AUT orientations for the reference polarization *γ*~pol~ = 90^o^.

The matrix operation for the rotations and translation is defined as

for the combined-axes system.

When facing the y axis, *α* = 90^o^ and *α* = -90^o^, the antenna does
not need to be evaluated for the 8 different rotations around the y
axis. A single rotation is sufficient since those orientations are
unique. Due to the pedestal of the 2-axis positioner, combined-axes
systems are not able to measure towards the *β* = 180^o^ direction; for
those systems, the reference measurements at this reference AUT
orientation can be skipped.

If the device re-positioning approach outlined in Annex C.3 is adopted
for all EIRP/EIS/TRP based conformance test cases, the quality of quiet
zone analysis is sufficient only for *β * = 0^o^, 45^o^, 90^o^, 270^o^,
and 315^o^~.~

D.2.8 Quality of quiet zone measurement uncertainty calculations for TRP
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The combined MU element related to the quality of the quiet zone for TRP
and offset between UE antenna array and centre of quiet zone is the
standard deviation of the various efficiency measurement results that
are based on the 7 different reference AUT positions, the respective
reference AUT orientations, and the two reference AUT polarization
orientations..

D.2.9 Quality of quiet zone measurement uncertainty for EIRP/EIS
----------------------------------------------------------------

The MU for the quality of the quiet zone for EIRP/EIS includes the
additional MU element of the directivity of the DUT and measurement
antennas as shown in Figure D.2.9-1. The EIRP/EIS measurements are
taking the peak gains of the respective antennas into account with the
reference AUT placed in the centre of the quiet zone. Once the antenna
is displaced in directions other than the measurement antenna, the
direct line-of-sight link is taking reduced antenna gains into account.
The type of reference AUT should therefore have similar pattern
properties as typical UE antennas. For systems with very large range
lengths, the directivity MU will be insignificant.

The combined MU element related to the quality of the quiet zone for
EIRP/EIS, offset between UE antenna array and centre of quiet zone, and
directivity is the standard deviation of the single-point gain
measurement results that are based on the 7 different reference AUT
positions, the respective reference AUT orientations, and the two
reference AUT polarization orientations.

########  Annex E: Rationale behind IFF method 1

E.1 IFF method 1 -- working principle
=====================================

A CATR (Compact Antenna Test Range) is a collimator system in which the
spherical wave is transformed in plane wave within the desired quiet
zone (QZ). In other words, a compact range project the measurement
(range) antenna infinitely far away thus making it a far-field range.
Figure E.1-1 does show this concept:

![CR 10m 30 deg](media/image105.emf){width="2.986111111111111in"
height="3.0in"}![](media/image106.wmf){width="3.236111111111111in"
height="2.5in"}

Figure E.1-1: Compact Range -- working principle

This is a reciprocal system setup. For TX measurements, the device under
test will radiate a spherical wavefront to the range collimator which
focalises into the feed antenna only the propagation vector which
matches with the boresight direction of the reflector. On the other
hand, for RX measurements, the feed antenna would radiate a spherical
wavefront to the range reflector which is collimated towards the DUT. In
other words, the spherical wavefront is transformed into a plane
wavefront when at the DUT.

In order to meet the requirements, the following parameters are mainly
considered when designing a CATR:

\- Quiet Zone

\- Focal length

\- Offset angle

\- Feed location

Figure E.1-2 does introduce the concept of quiet zone (QZ). Basically,
the plane wavefront (uniform amplitude and phase) is guaranteed in a
certain cylinder volume:

![](media/image107.png){width="3.3333333333333335in" height="3.0in"}

Figure E.1-2: CATR -- Quiet Zone concept

Quiet Zone size would depend on mainly the reflector, feed taper,
anechoic chamber design. In figure E.1-3 is shown the phase distribution
in the QZ for a state of the art CATR designed for 3m QZ size at 18GHz:

![](media/image108.png){width="5.236111111111111in" height="3.0in"}

Figure E.1-3: Phase curvature within the CATR QZ

It has to be noted that the total phase variation in the QZ for a CATR
is much lower than the phase variation (22.5deg) for a typical direct FF
range.

E.2 IFF method 1 - a far field system
=====================================

In this clause the CATR key points are reported.

E.2.1 Quiet zone
----------------

Quiet zone quality can be impacted by amplitude uniformity, phase
planarity and polarization purity.

Amplitude uniformity is mainly due to feed pattern, alignment and
reflector design while phase planarity is due to feed alignment and
reflector design. The polarization purity is mainly due to the parabolic
system geometry considering high polarization purity feeds.

The test procedure defined in TR 38.810 Annex D.2 for determining the MU
contribution from the quiet zone quality applies equally well to both
direct far-field and CATR systems.

Plots in Figure E.2.1-1 and E.2.1-2 show the amplitude and phase taper
plots of the in the quiet zone of a CATR system.

Figure E.2.1-2 that

\- The overall amplitude variation within the quiet zone is less than
1.2 dB

\- The overall phase variation within the quiet zone is less than 10˚

E.2.2 Implementation Requirements
---------------------------------

When it comes of CATR implementations, the reflector design is one of
the key point to be considered. Another important piece is the feed
antenna location in the system setup. Different implementations may
exist based on the test system frequency range and quite zone
requirements.

### E.2.2.1 Reflector(s) Type

The reflector design does play an important role when designing a CATR.

A Compact Range is a geometrical optical design, for which the
reflector(s) is large in wavelength. Edges diffraction (edges are like
cylindrical sources) needs to be minimized using edge treatment.

The lower frequency limit of a compact range depends on the edge
treatment.

The Quality of the Quiet Zone is characterized for CATR ranges and
always includes the reflections off the edges of the reflector. The
example specifications for a CATR system can be seen in Table E.2.2.1-1.
These specifications should show that the impact of these reflections is
minor. In order to meet such specifications, the reflector must be
designed in a way to reduce the reflection off the edges (the edges are
either curved or have serrated edges).

Table E.2.2.1-1: Example of CATR system specifications

  Frequency Range (GHz)                     1.5 -- 100
  ----------------------------------------- -----------------
  Quiet Zone Dimensions \[H x W x L\] (m)   0.5 x 0.5 x 0.5
  Cross Polarization (dB)                   -30

#### E.2.2.1.1 Serrated Edge

The direction of the edge is designed such that minimum diffraction
enters the quiet zone sources. With serrations, there is a smooth
transition between parabolic surface of the reflector and free space,
thus reducing the diffraction effects and directing the diffracted field
away from the QZ. The length of serrations defines the lowest frequency
of operation. Typical serrations length is 5λ.

#### E.2.2.1.2 Rolled edge

The edges of the compact range reflector are no longer cut off abruptly
but are smoothly bent backwards thus reducing the energy at the edges of
the reflector. With well-designed rolled edge, diffraction reduces
compared to serrated edge at the low and middle end of the frequency
spectrum.

### E.2.2.2 Feed Antenna location

The following are the feed locations most commonly used when designing a
CATR:

\- Side-fed

\- Floor-fed

\- Diagonal-fed

For a side-fed system, the feed is placed on one side of the chamber at
the same height as the centre of the quiet zone so that the ray from the
feed to the reflector to the centre of the quiet zone spans a horizontal
plane. For a floor-fed system, the feed in placed on the floor between
the reflector and the quiet zone so that the ray from the feed to
reflector to the centre of the quite zone spans a vertical plane. In
case of diagonal-fed (corner-fed) system, the feed is in a corner
between side wall and floor so that the ray from the feed to the
reflector to the centre of the quiet zone spans a diagonal plane.
Typically the diagonal fed-system allows for size reduction of the
anechoic chamber of approximately √2.

E.3 IFF method 1 -- reciprocity
===============================

CATR systems are inherently reciprocal, i.e. they support device
characterization in both transmit and receive modes and it has been
already used as such within 3GPP: TR 37.842 for testing active antenna
systems describes base station conformance testing for radiated transmit
power (EIRP) in clause 10.3.1 as well as for OTA sensitivity (EIS) in
clause 10.3.2.

The theoretical analysis behind this statement can be as follows:

C.A. Balanis (in his book \"Antenna Theory: Analysis and Design,\" Ch.
3, pp. 127-132) provides a thorough discussion of reciprocity and its
consequences for radiation patterns: In brief, it shows that, due to
reciprocity, the antenna patterns measured by a receiving probe antenna
with the DUT transmitting will be identical to those measured by the DUT
in receive mode when the probe antenna is transmitting. It is further
explained that reciprocity holds whenever certain conditions are met,
e.g. the device materials and propagation medium are linear.

These are the conditions met in a CATR:

As the nominally spherical wave from the feed antenna propagates toward
the mirror, it's power density per area, , falls off with the square of
the distance from the feed antenna so that at the mirror,

, (E.3-1)

where is the power transmitted from the feed antenna, is the gain of the
feed antenna, and is approximately the focal length of the mirror. The
precise distance from the feed antenna to the centre of the mirror is
typically slightly longer than the focal length due to the off-axis
illumination and parabolic curvature of the mirror.

does not change as the beam propagates to the DUT since the beam is
collimated. For a DUT in the quiet zone, the power received by the DUT
is the product of and the DUT's effective aperture, . This effective
aperture depends on the orientation of the DUT relative to the beam,
indicated by the DUT's elevation angle, , and its azimuth angle, . The
DUT's gain, is related to this aperture according to the formula

(E.3-2)

Thus, the ratio of received power to transmitted power, is

(E.3-3)

From this derivation, it is clear that the path-loss for a CATR does not
depend on the total distance between the feed antenna and the DUT but on
the focal length of the mirror instead.

Less intuitive is the derivation of the path loss when the DUT is in
transmit mode. In that case, the DUT's radiation pattern can be treated
as a superposition of plane waves propagating in different directions.
This superposition concept is valid whether the mirror is in the near or
far-field of the DUT. As shown in Figure E.3.1-1, the mirror captures
plane waves propagating in a range of directions, but the different
directions are focused to different points by the mirror. Only those
plane waves propagating along the optical axis of the mirror (indicated
in pink) are focused into the feed antenna for measurement; in this
mode, the feed antenna is receiving the signal from the DUT. Plane waves
at larger angles not captured by the mirror are instead absorbed by the
anechoic chamber. The particular angle measured by the feed antenna can
be varied by rotating the DUT. For example, a rotation of the DUT in
this figure could align the blue plane wave with the optical axis
allowing measurement of the transmitted power in that direction.

![](media/image123.png){width="4.159722222222222in"
height="3.3541666666666665in"}

Figure E.3-1: CATR when DUT is in transmit mode

The feed antenna can only capture radiation from the relatively small
range of angles that converge to a point within its aperture. The
maximum angular deviation from the optical axis that can be accepted by
the feed antenna is given by

$\tan\left( \varphi_{\max} \right) \approx \varphi_{\max} = \frac{r}{f}$
(E.3-4)

where is the radius of the aperture, is the focal length of the mirror,
and the small angle approximation - a very good approximation for
typical CATR geometries - has been invoked for simplicity.

The radiation intensity (power per unit solid angle), , emitted by the
DUT is the total power emitted divided by radians and multiplied by the
gain of the DUT;

(E.3-5)

The total power accepted by feed antenna is the integral of over the
range of angles that converge within its aperture. Using the small angle
approximation, the integral gives

(E.3-6)

Substituting for using (4), and with the aperture of the feed antenna as
, the ratio of power received by the feed antenna to power transmitted
by the DUT is

(E.3-7)

Equation (7) shows that the transmission losses from the DUT to the feed
are identical to the transmission losses from the feed to the DUT, given
by Eq. (3), thus proving reciprocity.

This reciprocity result, which holds true regardless of DUT orientation,
assures identical antenna pattern measurements for DUTs in both transmit
and receive modes. Beyond pattern measurements, this result also has
implications for other device tests. EIRP and EIS tests are both
possible in a CATR system as the same path losses are present in both
directions. Likewise, EVM in transmit and receive are supported since
both will experience the same predicted path losses given in Eqs. (7)
and (3).

Reporting measurement results in order to further detail the reciprocity
of a CATR by showing the comparison between the s12, and s21
coefficients of the scattering matrix have been obtained as follows:

\- Measurement results are from a commercial CATR at mmWave. This range
is capable of measuring DUTs within 24GHz to 40GHz frequency range. The
CATR is designed for a 1.5m QZ and the results are from a QZ ripple test
(field distribution) activity done on the setup. In figure E.3-2 the QZ
ripple test setup is shown:

![](media/image133.png){width="4.888888888888889in"
height="3.2222222222222223in"}

Figure E.3-2: CATR- QZ ripple test (field distribution) set up

\- A Standard Gain Horn (SGH) is used as reference antenna. Since it is
a field distribution measurement where the ability of the CATR to
emulate a plane wave in the QZ is tested, for all the measurements the
SGH aperture was pointing the CATR's reflector. The reference antenna
has been swept on the X and Y-axis when at different Z positions.
Especially, Vertical cut means that the scan is done long the Y-axis
while Horizontal Cut means that the scan is long the X-axis. In both
cases, Vertical and Horizontal components of the field are measured in
amplitude, and phase (complex quantity). The aim is to define the
amplitude and phase taper in the QZ. For our measurements, s21 and s12
coefficients have been measured and compared for each Y axis positions
(Vertical Cut) when the SGH is at Z=0, centre of the QZ.

\- Comparison between s21 and s12 complex coefficients (amplitude and
phase) is reported for 26.5GHz and Vertical Cut. Figure E.3.1-3 and
E.3.1-4 show the reciprocity in terms of amplitude and phase

E.4 IFF method 1 -- DUT offset from the QZ centre
=================================================

The uncertainty due to the DUT offset from the QZ centre can vary based
on the knowledge of antenna array position embedded in the DUT. In this
clause, an analysis of the impact of this uncertainty for CATR is
provided when measuring single points quantities such as both EIRP (TX
measurements) and EIS (RX measurements).

In figure E.4-1, and E.4-2 the test scenarios A1 and A2 are reported for
RX tests and TX tests respectively:

![](media/image136.png){width="6.847222222222222in"
height="2.0902777777777777in"}

Figure E.4-1: CATR -- RX tests scenarios A1 and A2

The QZ is within the collimated beam. There are no free space losses
between the reflector and DUT. The only path loss is between the feed
and the reflector so since this distance is fixed, this path loss can be
easily calibrated. The final spatial attenuation is equal to
1/F~L,eff~\^2, where F~L,eff~=effective focal length
=(2\*F~L~)/(1+cos(offset)). It means that the distance from the QZ to
the reflector is longer than the F~L~=focal length. In a state of the
art CATR, the offset is typically set to 27deg by design, so that the
F~L,eff~=1.058\*F~L~.

As a consequence of this, if DUT is moved within the QZ, there is no
change in the path loss so the power received in A1 is equal to power
received in A2. The associated uncertainty is then 0dB.

However, due to diffraction from the reflector, the field distribution
in the Quiet Zone is not perfectly uniform. Therefore, there will be
some variation for the amplitude and phase of the received field.
Typical amplitude variations are less than 1 dB within the Quiet Zone
and can be estimated by the QZ characterization process.

![](media/image137.png){width="6.847222222222222in" height="2.0625in"}

Figure E.4-2: CATR -- TX tests scenarios A1 and A2

The following assumptions can be considered:

\- Reciprocity

\- For a CATR the reciprocity is valid

\- Path loss calculation is identical to the RX case

\- DUT will have a radiation pattern which can be described as a series
of plane wave propagating in different directions. The particular plane
wave propagating along the reflector centreline will be focused on the
reflector feed. Figure E.4-3 does show this:

Figure E.4-3: CATR -- Radiation Pattern measurement when TX by DUT

\- By rotating the DUT in the QZ, the reflector moves a particular point
of the FF pattern along the CATR feed

\- No matter what the distances from the reflector are, the power
received from the feed is the same.

\- The final spatial attenuation at the feed is equal to 1/F~L,eff~\^2,
where F~L,eff~=effective focal length.

Based on the above assumptions the associated uncertainty is 0dB.

To better understand the above, mainly for the TX case -- DUT
transmitting, in Figure E.4-4 the CATR power transfer function is given:

![](media/image139.png){width="5.201388888888889in"
height="2.3055555555555554in"}

Figure E.4-4: CATR -- Power Transfer Function

Blue and Red lines are representing the DUT receiving and transmitting
respectively. It is assumed that all sources are isotropic point
sources. This assumption can be generalized to real sources since any
real source can be expanded in a number of isotropic sources.

When transmitting from the QZ (TX case -- DUT transmitting) the
spherical wavefront is imaged by the lens/reflector in the focal point
with the general magnification factor so that the below equations are
valid:

\- Loss up to the reflector -\> 1/R\^2

\- Gain up to the reflector -\> (R/F~L,eff~)\^2 -\> magnification factor
(R/F~L,eff~) where F~L,eff~=effective focal length

\- Total gain -\> 1/R\^2\*(R/F~L,eff~)\^2=1/F~L,eff~\^2

When transmitting from the focal point -- Fp (RX case -- DUT receiving)
the spherical wavefront from the feed is become a \"perfect\" plane wave
after the lens/reflector. The final attenuation is equal to
1/F~L,eff~\^2.

It was shown that in both cases the attenuation in the system is
proportional to the free space path loss provided by the distance from
the feed and lens/reflector. The attenuation is independent from the
distance to the QZ.

E.5 IFF method 1 -- operating frequency range
=============================================

Compact Antenna Test Range solution can cope with all frequencies
defined for FR2.

height="2.673611111111111in"}

Figure E.5-1. Example frequency specification for a CATR

E.6 IFF method 1 -- positioning system
======================================

CATR is provided with a positioning system such that the angle between
the dual-polarized measurement antenna and the DUT has at least two axes
of freedom and maintains a polarization reference. In the CATR case,
positioner is placed at the quiet zone area where the DUT is.

E.7 IFF method 1 -- link antennas
=================================

CATR for NR RF FR2 requirements includes a NR link antenna to allow off
centre beam measurements. Together with the UE beam lock test function,
this link antenna allows to measure the whole radiation pattern.

The way it is used is described below:

\- Before performing the UE beam lock test function, the measurement
probe acts as a link antenna maintaining polarization reference with
respect to the DUT. Once the beam is locked then the link is to be
passed to the link antenna which maintains reliable signal level with
respect to the DUT. Then UE can be rotated to measure the whole
radiation pattern without losing the connection with the system
simulator.

Hence, thanks to the link antennas and the UE Beam lock test function,
CATR is capable of centre and off centre of beam measurements.

Additionally, for setups intended for measurements of UE RF
characteristics in non-standalone (NSA) mode with 1UL configuration, an
LTE link antenna is used to provide the LTE link to the DUT

\- The LTE link antenna provides a stable LTE signal without precise
path loss or polarization control

CATR is provided with such LTE link antenna.

########  Annex F: Rationale behind NFTF method

F.1 NFTF method -- working principle
====================================

A NFTF (Near Field to Far Field Transform) system measures the amplitude
and phase on a surface (spherical in this case) around he DUT. The 3D
far field pattern is obtained by using a modal spherical wave expansion.
The Near Field to Far Field Transform is based on the Huygen's
principle. A direct solution of the Helmholtz equations is found by
applying boundary conditions on the surface at an infinite distance away
from the DUT. From the tangential fields over the surface, the modal
coefficients can be determined using the orthogonality of the modal
expansion.

The Near to Far field transform is performed in two steps:

\- Expansion (or projection) of the measured Near Field over a set of
orthogonal basis functions to evaluate the transformed spectrum

> *E~meas~(r) = Spectrum \* F~basis~(r)*

\- FF (EFF) computation using a the previously calculated spectrum and
with the basis functions evaluated at r∞ :

> *E~FF~ = Spectrum \* F~basis~(r∞)*

The Nyquist sampling criterion must be met to obtain enough measurement
points for the near field to far field transform to be valid. The
equations for the sampling criterion are below:

![](media/image141.png){width="1.0in"
height="0.5465277777777777in"}![](media/image142.png){width="4.0in"
height="3.5555555555555554in"}

Figure F.1-1: Sampling Criterion

The method outlined above is normally performed on antennas which are
fed from a signal source but can also apply to DUTs which are
transmitting by using the phase recovery technique.

F.2 NFTF -- Spherical Scan
==========================

A circular probe array as shown in Figure F.3-1 can measure the full 3D
pattern with a rotation in azimuth only. Through use of electronic
switching between the probe array elements the points in elevation can
be measured without rotating the DUT in the elevation plane.
Alternatively, by connecting each probe to a receiver, it is possible to
simultaneously measure the points in elevation without the need to
rotate the DUT in the elevation plane.

F.3 NFTF -- Implementation for Self-Transmitting DUTs
=====================================================

F.3.1 Phase Recovery Technique
------------------------------

![](media/image143.png){width="6.395833333333333in" height="3.625in"}

Figure F.3-1: Typical Test System using Phase Recovery Technique

Figure F.3-1 shows the block diagram of a Near Field Range with the
Phase Recovery Unit.

The technique is based on the synchronous reception of two signals, the
measurement and reference. The signal transmitted by the DUT is measured
simultaneously with two probes, one being the measurement probe and the
other being the reference probe. These two signals are fed into the PRU
(Phase Recovery Unit) and the amplitude and absolute phase are acquired.

F.3.2 Obtaining EIRP and TRP
----------------------------

During the near field to far field transformation process, the
calibration is applied so that the transmitted power (EIRP) is
transformed from dB to dBm. Because the full 3D pattern is measured the
TRP can be calculated using the EIRP results. The EIRP results at beam
peak can be also easily obtained.

F.4 NFTF -- Measurement Uncertainty due to Phase Variation
==========================================================

During the near field to far field transform the DUT's offset from the
reference coordinate system is corrected for. This is can be achieved
because the absolute phase is measured.

![SWC-Figure 4](media/image144.png){width="3.3680555555555554in"
height="2.0in"} ![SWC1-Figure
4](media/image145.png){width="3.0069444444444446in" height="2.0in"}

Figure F.4-1: Spherical Wave Coefficients (SWC) graphical representation

Figure 4.1 shows the Spherical Wave Coefficients of a horn measured at
three different distances away from the center of the reference
coordinate system. As can be seen in the figures:

\- The DUT far field pattern remains the same

\- The DUT far field phase changes with a vector component defined by
the displacement of the reference coordinate system

\- The number of spherical wave that are needed to fully represent the
antenna increases as the DUT moves further away from the center of the
reference coordinate system.

\- As the minimum sphere increases the number of field samples
increases.

If the criteria above are respected during the near field acquisition,
there is no uncertainty due to the DUT offset from the reference
coordinate system (center of the QZ).

########  Annex G: Measurement Grids

This appendix describes the assumptions and definition of the minimum
number of measurement grid points for various grid types.

A total of three measurement grids are considered:

\- Beam Peak Search Grid: using this grid, the TX and RX beam peak
direction will be determined. 3D EIRP scans are used to determine the TX
beam peak direction and 3D Throughput/RSRP/EIS scans for RX beam peak
directions.

\- Spherical Coverage Grid: using this grid, the CDF of the EIRP/EIS
distribution in 3D is calculated to determine the spherical coverage
performance.

\- TRP Measurement Grid: using this grid, the total power radiated by
the DUT in the TX beam peak direction is determined by integrating the
EIRP measurements taken on the sampling grid.

G.1 TRP Measurement Grids
=========================

This sub-clause describes the assumptions and derives the minimum number
of TRP measurement grid points for various grid types.

G.1.1 Assumptions
-----------------

For non-sparse antenna arrays used for smartphone UEs, an 8 x 2 antenna
array was used for the measurement grid analyses. Table G.1.1-1 and
Table G.1.1-2 outline the adapted equations from \[9\] that are used to
simulate the UE antenna patterns for in-band measurements.

The reference/baseline antenna pattern is shown in Figure G.1.1-1

![](media/image153.png){width="3.0in" height="3.076388888888889in"}

Figure G.1.1-1: Reference 8x2 Antenna Pattern

The relative orientation of the simulated antenna array and the
measurement grid is altered randomly and the standard deviation between
TRPs for each measurement grid is derived from a set of 10000 random
orientations.

In Figure G.1.1-2, three rotations used for the simulation analyses are
illustrated, i.e., the antenna pattern are rotated in φ and θ but also
along its beam peak axis.

φ, centre: 45^o^ in θ (instead of 90^o^ as shown in Figure G.1.1-1),
right: rotation of 45^o^ along the beam peak axis (angle α)

The randomization of the various rotations is illustrated in Figure
G.1.1-3. The rotations in φ and α can be handled in a completely random
fashion, e.g., phi\_rot = 360\*rand(10000,1). For the rotations around
θ, the number of rotations near the poles should be the same compared to
the equator since the surface area near the poles is much smaller than
around the equator, i.e., the distribution needs to be scaled by sin(θ).

The minimum number of measurements points shall guarantee that the
standard deviation for the TRP measurement grid shall not exceed 0.25dB
for all DUT types.

G.1.2 Grid Types
----------------

Two different measurement grid types are considered.

The constant step size grid type has the azimuth and elevation angles
uniformly distributed as illustrated in Figures G.1.2-1 in 2D and
G.1.2-2 in 3D.

Constant density grid types have measurement points that are evenly
distributed on the surface of the sphere with a constant density as
illustrated in Figures G.1.2-3 in 2D and G.1.2-4 in 3D.

G.1.2 TRP Integration for Constant Step Size Grid Type
------------------------------------------------------

Different approaches to perform the TRP integration from the respective
EIRP measurements are outlined in the next sub clauses for the constant
step size grid type.

### G.1.2.1 TRP Integration using Weights

In many engineering disciplines, the integral of a function needs to be
solved using numerical integration techniques, commonly referred to as
\"quadrature\". Here, the approximation of the integral of a function is
usually stated as a weighted sum of function values at specified points
within the domain of integration. The derivation from the closed surface
TRP integral

![](media/image166.emf){width="2.8333333333333335in"
height="0.4722222222222222in"}

to the classical discretized summation equation used for OTA

![](media/image167.emf){width="5.416666666666667in"
height="0.6111111111111112in"}

has been derived in \[15\]. The weights for this integral are based on
the sinθ⋅∆θ weights. More accurate implementations are based on the
Clenshaw-Curtis quadrature integral approximation based on an expansion
of the integrand in terms of Chebyshev polynomials. This implementation
does not ignore the measurement points at the poles (θ=0^o^ and 180^o^)
where sinθ = 0. The discretized TRP can be expressed as

![](media/image168.emf){width="4.152777777777778in"
height="0.6111111111111112in"}

which the sinθ⋅∆θ weights replaced by a weight function W(θ) and extends
the sum over I to include the poles. The Clenshaw-Curtis weights are
compared to the classical sin θ⋅∆θ weights in Tables G.1.2.1-1 and
G.1.2.1-2 for two different numbers of latitudes. The TRP measurement
grid consists of N+1 latitudes and M longitudes with

$\theta_{i} = i\mathrm{\Delta}\theta\ \text{where}\ \mathrm{\Delta}\theta = \frac{\pi}{N}$

and

$\phi_{j} = j\mathrm{\Delta}\phi\ \text{where}\ \mathrm{\Delta}\phi = \frac{2\pi}{M}$

### G.1.2.2 TRP Surface Integral using the Jacobian Matrix

Total Radiated Power is given by the integral of the Effective Isotropic
Radiated Power over the closed spherical surface S:

$TRP = ∯_{S}^{}{\frac{EIRP(\overrightarrow{r})}{4\pi\ }\text{\ \ d}S}$

Given any surface parameterization of

$\overrightarrow{r}\left( u_{1},u_{2} \right) = {\lbrack\begin{matrix}
x(u_{1},u_{2}) & y(u_{1},u_{2}) & z(u_{1},u_{2}) \\
\end{matrix}\rbrack}^{T}$

The explicit general TRP surface integral is

$TRP = ∯_{S}^{}{\frac{EIRP(\overrightarrow{r}\left( u_{1},u_{2} \right))}{4\pi\ }\ \  \bullet \sqrt{det(J^{T}J)} \bullet \text{du}_{1}}\text{du}_{2}$

where J is the Jacobian Matrix defined at$\text{\ i}$ row and $j$ column
is

$\ J_{i,j} = \frac{{\partial r}_{i}}{{\partial x}_{j}}$

The differential surface area element, in its most general form, is

$dS = \sqrt{det(J^{T}J)} \bullet \text{du}_{1}\text{du}_{2}$

The standard surface parameterization used in 3GPP to date is based on
the definition of Spherical Coordinate System parameterization
$\left( u_{1} = \theta,u_{2} = \varnothing \right)\ $on a constant
radius sphere where

$\overrightarrow{r}\left( u_{1} = \theta,u_{2} = \varnothing \right) = \begin{bmatrix}
x \\
y \\
z \\
\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
\sin\theta\cos\varnothing \\
\sin\theta\sin\varnothing \\
\cos\theta \\
\end{bmatrix}$

which yields the Jacobian Matrix

$J = \begin{bmatrix}
\frac{\partial x}{\partial\theta} & \frac{\partial x}{\partial\varnothing} \\
\frac{\partial y}{\partial\theta} & \frac{\partial y}{\partial\varnothing} \\
\frac{\partial z}{\partial\theta} & \frac{\partial z}{\partial\varnothing} \\
\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
\cos{\theta\cos\varnothing} & {- sin}\theta\sin\varnothing \\
\cos\theta\sin\varnothing & \sin\theta\cos\varnothing \\
 - \sin\theta & 0 \\
\end{bmatrix}$.

Hence, the differential surface area is the familiar

$dS = \sqrt{det(J^{T}J)}d\theta d\varnothing = \sin\theta d\theta d\varnothing$

The Total Radiated Power under a Spherical Coordinate parameterization
is the familiar 3GPP equation \[4\]\[5\]

$TRP = ∯_{S}^{}{\frac{EIRP(\theta,\varnothing)}{4\pi\ }\ \  \bullet \sin\theta \bullet d\theta}d\varnothing$

This form of the integral is exact in the continuous case but prone to
uncertainty for finite discrete uniform grid spacing

$TRP \approx \frac{\pi}{2\ NM}\sum_{i = 1}^{N - 1}{\sum_{j = 0}^{M - 1}{EIRP(\theta_{i},\ \phi_{j})\sin\left( \theta_{i} \right)}}$

The Spherical Coordinate system is not the only possible
parameterization of the surface. One alternative, by definition to
alleviate the sin θ = 0 $\sin\theta = 0$problem at the sampling poles,
is to consider the surface S as composed of a set of infinitesimal
triangles. This triangulation method is commonly used in Finite Element
Analysis and is based on Barycentric coordinates. The Barycentric
parametrization $\left( u_{1} = \xi,u_{2} = \eta \right)$ with the
domain $\xi \in \left\lbrack 0,1 \right\rbrack$ and
$\eta \in \left\lbrack 0,1 \right\rbrack$ is

$\overrightarrow{r}\left( u_{1} = \xi,u_{2} = \eta \right) = \begin{bmatrix}
x \\
y \\
z \\
\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
\left( x_{1} - x_{0} \right)\xi + \left( x_{2} - x_{0} \right)\eta + x_{0} \\
\left( y_{1} - y_{0} \right)\xi + \left( y_{2} - y_{0} \right)\eta + y_{0} \\
\left( z_{1} - z_{0} \right)\xi + \left( z_{2} - z_{0} \right)\eta + z_{0} \\
\end{bmatrix}$

The Jacobian Matrix for the Barycentric parameterization is

$J = \begin{bmatrix}
\frac{\partial x}{\partial\xi} & \frac{\partial x}{\partial\eta} \\
\frac{\partial y}{\partial\xi} & \frac{\partial y}{\partial\eta} \\
\frac{\partial z}{\partial\xi} & \frac{\partial z}{\partial\eta} \\
\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
{\overrightarrow{J}}_{0} & {\overrightarrow{J}}_{1} \\
\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
\left( x_{1} - x_{0} \right) & \left( x_{2} - x_{0} \right) \\
\left( y_{1} - y_{0} \right) & \left( y_{2} - y_{0} \right) \\
\left( z_{1} - z_{0} \right) & \left( z_{2} - z_{0} \right) \\
\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
\left( {\overrightarrow{r}}_{1} - {\overrightarrow{r}}_{0} \right) & \left( {\overrightarrow{r}}_{2} - {\overrightarrow{r}}_{0} \right) \\
\end{bmatrix}$

and by Lagrange\'s identity $\sqrt{det(J^{T}J)} =$
$\left\| {\overrightarrow{J}}_{0} \times {\overrightarrow{J}}_{1} \right\|$,
the differential surface element is

$dS = \sqrt{det(J^{T}J)}d\text{ξdη} = \left\| \left( {\overrightarrow{r}}_{1} - {\overrightarrow{r}}_{0} \right) \times \left( {\overrightarrow{r}}_{2} - {\overrightarrow{r}}_{0} \right) \right\| d\text{ξdη}$

Hence, the TRP integral expressed in Barycentric coordinates is

$TRP = ∯_{S}^{}{\frac{EIRP(\xi,\eta)}{4\pi\ }\ \  \bullet \left\| \left( {\overrightarrow{r}}_{1} - {\overrightarrow{r}}_{0} \right) \times \left( {\overrightarrow{r}}_{2} - {\overrightarrow{r}}_{0} \right) \right\| \bullet d\xi}\text{dη}$

and is approximated by the sum over all triangles $\mathrm{\Delta}_{i}$
*composing the closed surface S*

$4\pi TRP \approx \sum_{i}^{}{\int_{\eta = 0}^{1}{\int_{\xi = 0}^{1 - \eta}{\text{EIRP}_{i}(\xi,\eta)\left\| \left( {\overrightarrow{r}}_{1,i} - {\overrightarrow{r}}_{0,i} \right) \times \left( {\overrightarrow{r}}_{2,i} - {\overrightarrow{r}}_{0,i} \right) \right\|\text{dξdη}}}}$

The notation of explicitly adding the subscript to the
$\text{EIRP}_{i}(\xi,\eta)$ *explicitly states the double integral of
EIRP over each independent i^th^ triangle* has the identical bounds of
integration; $\xi = \lbrack 0,1 - \eta\rbrack$ and
$\xi = \lbrack 0,1\rbrack$ which is accomplished by mapping to the
standard triangle via a change of coordinates. In Barycentric
coordinates, this coordinate transform is trivially accomplished knowing
only the sample points at the vertices of the triangle as

$\text{EIRP}_{i}(\xi,\eta) = \text{EIRP}_{0,i} + \left( \text{EIRP}_{1,i} - \text{EIRP}_{0,1} \right)\xi + \left( \text{EIRP}_{2,i} - \text{EIRP}_{0,i} \right)\eta$

Every EIRP value in the interior of the triangle is computed as
$\text{EIRP}_{i}(\xi,\eta)$ *knowing only the three measured samples
\[EIRP~0,i~, EIRP~1,i~, EIRP~2,i~\] within the triangle domain*
$\xi = \lbrack 0,1 - \eta\rbrack$ and $\xi = \lbrack 0,1\rbrack$ *as
illustrated in Figure G.1.2.2-1.*

Figure G.1.2.2-1: Illustration of the triangulated sphere including the
triangle formed by three measurements points

The cross product term,
${2A}_{i} \equiv \left\| \left( {\overrightarrow{r}}_{1,i} - {\overrightarrow{r}}_{0,i} \right) \times \left( {\overrightarrow{r}}_{2,i} - {\overrightarrow{r}}_{0,i} \right) \right\|$,
is constant relative to the integration variables so the TRP
approximation further simplifies to

$4\pi TRP \approx \sum_{i}^{}{{2A}_{i}\int_{\eta = 0}^{1}{\int_{\xi = 0}^{1 - \eta}{\left\lbrack \text{EIRP}_{0,i} + \left( \text{EIRP}_{1,i} - \text{EIRP}_{0,1} \right)\xi + \left( \text{EIRP}_{2,i} - \text{EIRP}_{0,i} \right)\eta \right\rbrack\text{dξdη}}}}$

The double integral therefore is computed explicitly yielding

$4\pi TRP \approx \sum_{i}^{}{2A_{i} \bullet \left( \frac{\text{EIRP}_{0,i} + \text{EIRP}_{1,i} + \text{EIRP}_{2,i}}{6} \right)\ }$

The final form of the TRP approximation based on Barycentric surface
parameterization is

$TRP \approx \frac{1}{4\pi}\sum_{i}^{}{A_{i} \bullet \left( \frac{\text{EIRP}_{0,i} + \text{EIRP}_{1,i} + \text{EIRP}_{2,i}}{3} \right)\ }$

This yields an intuitive geometrical description of TRP approximation as
simply the sum of all discrete triangle areas composing the closed
spherical surface S, with each triangle scaled by the mean value of EIRP
at the three measurement vertices. Guaranteed non-zero terms inside the
sum mitigate possible numerical approximation issue at the poles, unlike
the *sin *θ $\sin\theta$based TRP approximation. Notice that no
particular definition of sample type is required for this
Barycentric-based definition of TRP. This formulation can be applied to
uniform grid sampling, as well as uniform density sampling, or even
completely random sampling.

The mean offset can be optimized by explicitly computing the surface
area of the sphere's polyhedral approximation
($4\pi \approx \sum_{i}^{}{A_{i}\ }$) using

$TRP \approx \frac{\sum_{i}^{}{A_{i} \bullet \left( \frac{\text{EIRP}_{0,i} + \text{EIRP}_{1,i} + \text{EIRP}_{2,i}}{3} \right)\ }}{\sum_{i}^{}{A_{i}\ }}$

The Jacobian integration technique is based on subdividing the sphere
into triangles and estimating the TRP integral as the sum of all
triangles mean value of EIRP sampled at the triangle vertices. Given
identical set of sampled points on the sphere (uniform grid spacing in
both φ and θ), there is not a single unique representation of
interconnections between the samples. In the limit as the grid spacing
becomes infinitesimally small, there is no difference in TRP estimation,
but the reverse is not strictly true. For small but finite angular grid
sampling, there can be differences in the statistical TRP properties
depending on the differences in mesh triangulation. Two different Matlab
triangulations are illustrated in Figure G.1.2.2-2 on the left, Matlab's
default convex hull triangulation, and on the right, a symmetric
\"ferromagnetic\" triangulation implementation.

G.1.3 TRP Integration for Constant Density Grid Types
-----------------------------------------------------

For constant density grid types, the TRP integration should ideally take
into account the area of the Voronoi region surrounding each grid point.
Assuming an ideal constant density configuration of the grid points, the
TRP can be approximated using

![](media/image172.emf){width="4.881944444444445in"
height="0.5763888888888888in"}

where N is the number of grid points of the constant density grid type.

The following observations can be made:

\- The standard deviation and the spread in TRP results is largest with
the sin(θ) quadrature

\- The smallest standard deviation and the smallest spread in TRP
results is obtained with the Clenshaw-Curtis, and the Jacobian
quadrature utilizing the ferromagnetic triangulation (from best to
worst)

\- The triangulation approach has an impact on the standard deviation
and the spread in TRP results with the \"ferromagnetic\" approach
outperforming the non symmetric triangulation approach

\- All four quadratures meet the 0.25dB standard deviation for the 15^o^
step size measurement grid.

\- With the Clenshaw Curtis, spherical integration quadrature, and the
Jacobian quadrature with ferromagnetic triangulation, a constant-step
size measurement grid with 12 latitudes and 19 longitudes is sufficient
to meet the maximum standard deviation of 0.25dB.

The results for two different constant-density grid implementations
(charged particle and golden spiral) are summarized in Table G.1.4-2 for
the 8x2 reference antenna pattern.

The Charged Particle implementation requires a minimum number of 135
points and the Golden Spiral requires a minimum number of 150 points.

G.1.5 Interpolation at or near the Pole
---------------------------------------

As illustrated in Figure G.1.5-1, for systems that either do not allow
measurements at the pole (θ=180^o^), e.g., using distributed-axes
positioners, or systems that have the positioners/support structures
block the radiation towards the pole (θ=180^o^), e.g., combined-axes
positioners, the measurements in the region close to the pole at
θ=180^o^ can be skipped and interpolated instead.

Figure G.1.5-1: Illustration of areas around the pole that either cannot
be reached by the measurement antenna or are blocked by the positioner.

The results tabulated in Tables G.1.5-1 and G.1.5-2 outline the results
of a statistical analyses similar to those in Annex G.1.4 for the 8x2
antenna array. However, in these analyses, the positioning concept was
considered, i.e., the analyses were performed with the assumption that
the beam peak direction is oriented away from the hemisphere towards the
pole at θ = 180^o^. Additionally, the standard deviations are presented
when ranges of pattern values are disregarded (zeroed out). For the
constant-step size measurement grids, three cases were investigated,
i.e., no pattern values are disregarded, values only at one latitude at
θ=180^o^, and the values at the bottom two latitudes are disregarded.
For the constant density measurement grids, a similar investigation was
performed using the Charged Particle implementation. Since there are no
latitudes defined, the three cases investigated were: no pattern values
are disregarded, values between 165^o^ ≤ θ ≤ 180^o^, and values between
150^o^ ≤ θ ≤ 180^o^ are disregarded.

These results clearly show that for the measurement grids proposed in
G.1.4 and with the re-positioning concept considered, the measurements
beyond 165^o^ in θ can be skipped and interpolated instead. However,
alternate measurement grids listed in Tables G.1.5-1 and G.1.5-2 with
larger number of grid points than those proposed in G.1.4 are not
precluded where the measurements beyond 150^o^ in θ can be skipped and
interpolated instead provided that the standard deviation of 0.25 dB is
met.

G.2 Beam Peak Search Measurement Grids
======================================

G.2.1 Assumptions
-----------------

The simulation assumptions for the beam peak measurement grids are the
same as outlined in Annex G.1.1.

G.2.2 Grid Types
----------------

Same grids as in G.1.2 are considered.

G.2.3 Simulation results
------------------------

The most realistic approach is to analyse the statistical distribution
of the beam peak error for a large number of random orientations.

For the simulations, the relative orientation of the simulated antenna
array and the measurement grid was altered randomly. The statistical
results from simulations using 50,000 random orientations are then used
to determine mean error, standard deviation and percentile analysis on
CDF curve of all maximum EIRPs for each measurement grid. The EIRPs are
normalized by the known 8x2 antenna peak antenna gain.

Sample histograms and CDF distributions for the beam peak error for
constant step-size measurement grids are shown in Figure G.2.3-1 and for
the constant density measurement grid (based on the charged particle
implementation) in Figure G.2.3-2. The histograms show a half-normal
distribution.

Given the half-normal distribution, the MU term should be based on the
determination of the offset from the beam peak that contains 95% of the
distribution (alternatively, the value at which the CDF is 5%). This
offset shall be considered a systematic error in the MU budget. The
various statistical metrics are illustrated in Figure G.2.3-3.

The mean error and the standard deviation, and the offset at which the
CDF is 5% are tabulated in Table G.2.3-1 for the constant step size
grids and Table G.2.3-2 for the constant density grids and plotted in
Figures G.2.3-4. Figure G.2.3-5 and Figure G.2.3-6 respectively.

Figure G.2.3-6: Offset from the beam peak at which the CDF is 5% of the

It can be seen that practical measurement grids of less than 1000 unique
measurement points yield mean errors of less than 0.2dB and standard
deviations of less than 0.2dB, and offsets from beam peak at which CDF
is 5% of less than about 0.5dB.

In Table G.2.3-3, the minimum number of unique grid points are listed
for each grid type investigated for sample systematic errors of 'Beam
Peak Search' of 0.2 to 0.7dB. The option with the 0.5dB seems to be best
compromise in terms of MU and test points/test time.

Taking into account simulation results above and in order to make a
reasonable trade-off with measurement uncertainties, it is recommended
to use for beam peak search the following measurement grids leading to a
systematic error of \"Beam Peak Search\" of 0.5 dB:

\- Constant density grid (using the charged particle implementation)
with at least 800 grid points.

\- Constant step size grid with at least 1106 grid points, corresponding
to an angular step size of 7.5º.

The metric using a single, fine grid for the TX beam peak search is EIRP
and for the RX beam peak search it is EIS.

G.2.4 Coarse and fine measurement grids
---------------------------------------

The baseline beam peak search is based on a single and fine beam peak
search grid to determine the TX/RX beam peak of the DUT in any given
direction. This means that even in sectors where poor EIRP/EIS
performance is observed, a very fine grid is used to search for the
TX/RX beam peak.

An optimized approach, based on an initial coarse search followed by a
subsequent fine search could reduce the number of beam peak search grid
points significantly. The basis for this approach is to use a coarse
grid with fewer number of points than the ones described in clause G.2.3
in the first stage to identify candidate regions that contain the global
beam peak and search for the global beam peak with the fine grid in the
second stage with a minimum number of points described in clause G.2.3.

As an example, Figure G.2.4-1 illustrates the coarse and fine
measurement grid approach applied to TX beam search; while this
illustration is for EIRP, it can easily be extended to RX beam peak
search using EIS or throughput metrics For simplification purposes, 2D
coarse and fine searches are illustrated but the concept can be extended
to 3D easily. The UE is assumed to form a total of six beams in the 2D
plane as illustrated on the left of Figure G.2.4-1. In the centre of
Figure G.2.4-1, the 36 coarse beam peak search grid points in the 2D
plane are illustrated. On the right, the grey circles on the respective
antenna patterns illustrate the measured EIRP values towards each coarse
grid point direction based on the respective beam steering directions.
This illustration shows that the EIRP beam peak of the coarse search,
EIRP~CSBP~, is found to be the peak of the orange beam while the global
TX beam peak (red beam) was not identified due to the coarse sampling of
the grid points.

Peak Search. Left: Antenna Pattern assumptions in 2D, Centre: Coarse
beam peak search grid points/discrete antenna measurement positions,
Right: TX beam EIRP measurements per grid point

The proposed fine search approach is illustrated further in Figure
G.2.4-2. A fine search region starting from the beam peak identified in
the coarse search, EIRP~CSBP~, over a range of ∆~FS~ is used to identify
the regions that need to be investigated more closely with the fine
search algorithm. The fine search range ∆~FS~ is a function of the
angular spacing of the coarse beam peak search grid as well as the beam
width of the reference antenna pattern considered for smartphone UEs.

measurement grids while Figure G.2.4-4 illustrates the same for constant
density grid.

The metric using a coarse & fine grid approach for the TX beam peak
search is EIRP for both grids. For RX beam peak search either EIS or
Throughput could be used for coarse grids while only EIS for fine grid,

G.3 Spherical coverage Measurement Grids
========================================

G.3.1 Assumptions
-----------------

The simulation assumptions for the spherical coverage grids are the same
as outlined in Annex G.1.1.

Regarding the antenna implementation and beamformer, the following
assumptions have been made (refer to Figure G.3.1-1):

\- Two 8x2 antenna arrays are integrated in the UE for the spherical
coverage analyses

\- The implementation loss for the antenna near the front is 5dB less
than that for the antenna near the back

\- For Beam Steering Assumptions

\- In the xz plane, 45^o^ beam steering granularity (from 45^o^ to
135^o^) has been used

\- In the xy plane, 22.5^o^ beam steering granularity (from -90^o^ to
90^o^) has been used

height="2.3618055555555557in"}

Figure G.3.1-1: Illustration of the two antenna arrays integrated in the
UE.

Regarding UE Orientations/Rotations, the following assumptions were made
for the analyses:

\- 10000 random relative orientations between the simulated UE and the
respective measurement grids

\- The rotations of UE/grid will be along θ and φ as well as around the
beam peak

\- The rotations along θ will utilize a sin(θ) weighting to assume a
uniform sampling on the surface.

When using constant step size measurement grids, a theta-dependent
correction shall be applied, i.e., the PDF probability contribution for
each measurement point is scaled by sin(theta).

G.3.2 Grid Types
----------------

Same grids as in G.1.2 are considered.

G.3.3 Simulation results
------------------------

### G.3.3.1 EIRP spherical coverage

The reference CDF curve was determined with a very fine constant step
size measurement grid using a 1^o^ step size in θ and φ. The need for
scaling the PDFs by sin(θ) is highlighted in Figure G.3.3.1-1 for an
EIRP spherical coverage CDF analysis based on 10000 random UE
orientations with a 1^o^ constant step size grid. While the CDF curves
in Figure G.3.3.1-1a are based on the PDF scaled by sin(θ), the curves
in Figure G.3.3.1-1b were not using the θ dependent scaling. Clearly,
the sin(θ) scaling makes the CDF curves converge to the reference CDF
curve for this very fine measurement grid, while the simulated CDFs
without the sin(θ) scaling of the PDF are spread rather wide and can
therefore not be used for CDF analyses.

At the 50%-tile CDF, i.e., the target CDF for Power Class 3, statistical
analyses of all 10000 EIRPs, EIRP~50%CDF~, is performed. For the example
of the 1^o^ constant step size grid, the histogram is shown in Figure

#### G.3.3.1.1 Analyses with 8x2 Antenna Array with Beam Peak on the Measurement Grid

The results shown in this clause are based on the 8x2 antenna array with
the beam peak always aligned on a grid point. For these simulations, the
completely random UE rotations in θ and φ were always re-adjusted to the
next closest measurement grid point.

The results for various measurement grids are tabulated in Table

negligible (\<0.1dB) for more than \~300 unique measurement points for

Figure G.3.3.1.1-2: CDF results for the 8x2 antenna array for constant
density measurement grids and the beam peak always aligned on a grid
point.

It can be observed that:

\- For the 8x2 reference antenna array with the beam peak always aligned
on the measurement grid, the standard deviation of the EIRP~50%CDF~ is
negligible (\<0.1dB) for more than \~200 unique measurement points for
constant density size grids (using the charged particle implementation).

\- For the 8x2 reference antenna array with the beam peak always aligned
on the measurement grid, the mean error of the EIRP~50%CDF~ is always
negligible (0.1dB) even for very small number of measurement points for
constant density size grids.

The standard deviations between the constant step size and constant
density grids is shown in Figure G.3.3.1.1-3 for the 8x2 antenna with
the beam peak always placed on a grid point.

The constant density measurement grids require fewer measurement points

deviation.

#### G.3.3.1.2 Analyses with 8x2 Antenna Array with Beam Peak oriented completely randomly

The results in this clause are based on the 8x2 antenna array with the
beam peak oriented in completely random orientations, i.e., the beam
peak is not always aligned to a grid point. This analysis was performed
to see whether the beam peaks have to be aligned with a grid point if
only the min. EIRP value at the 50%-tile CDF is of interest. It is
understood that the CDF curve cannot be used to accurately determine the
TX beam peak (100%-tile CDF).

The results for various constant-step size measurement grids are
tabulated in Table G.3.3.1.2-1.

The standard deviations and mean errors for the constant step size and

respectively, for the 8x2 antenna with the beam peak always placed on a
grid point and with the beam peak placed in completely random
orientations. Figure G.3.3.1.2-3 is looking at the max range of the
50%-tile CDF EIRPs which is the difference between the max and the min
50%-tile CDF EIRPs.

#### G.3.3.1.3 Conclusions

According to results in clause G.3.3.1.1 and G.3.3.1.2, the following
conclusions can be extracted:

\- The EIRP spherical coverage measurement can be performed without
having to have the beam peak having to be placed on a grid point, e.g.,
for coarse grids of beam peak searches.

\- In order to make a reasonable trade-off with measurement
uncertainties, it is recommended to use for spherical coverage grids
measurement grids with at least 200 unique measurement points, i.e.,

\- constant density grid (using the charged particle implementation)
with at least 200 grid points: STD of 0.11dB and 0dB Mean Error

\- constant step size grid with at least 266 grid points: STD of 0.12dB
and 0dB Mean Error

### G.3.3.2 EIS spherical coverage

The reference CDF curve was determined with a very fine constant step
size measurement grid using a 1^o^ step size in θ and φ. The need for
scaling the PDFs by sin(θ) is highlighted in Figure G.3.3.2-1 for an EIS
spherical coverage CDF analysis based on 10000 random UE orientations
with a 1^o^ constant step size grid. While the CDF curves in Figure
G.3.3.2-1a are based on the PDF scaled by sin(θ), the curves in Figure
G.3.3.2-1b were not using the θ dependent scaling. Clearly, the sin(θ)
scaling makes the CDF curves converge to the reference CDF curve for
this very fine measurement grid, while the simulated CDFs without the
sin(θ) scaling of the PDF are spread rather wide and can therefore not
be used for CDF analyses.

size measurement grid. a) with the sin(θ) scaling of the PDF and b)
without the θ dependent scaling.

At the 50%-tile CDF, i.e., the target CDF for PC3 \[5\], statistical
analyses of all 10000 EISs, EIS~50%CDF~, is performed. For the example
of the 1^o^ constant step size grid, the histogram is shown in Figure
G.3.3.2-2.

Figure G.3.3.2-2: Sample Histogram of the 10000 min EISs at the 50%-tile
CDF for a very fine 1^o^ constant step size measurement grid.

While EIRP is measured with a seemingly infinitesimal power accuracy by
the test equipment, EIS is determined for finite DL power levels which
has to be taken into account for the analyses. For instance, if the
\"true\" EIS in a direction was -90.65dBm, the EIS following EIS values
would be measured:

\- -90.6dBm for a 0.1dB DL power step size

\- -90.5dBm for a 0.5dB DL power step size

\- -90dBm for a 1dB DL power step size

The analyses in this contribution are taking an unrealistic
infinitesimal DL power step size as well as finite 0.1, 0.5, and 1dB
step sizes into account.

#### G.3.3.2.1 Analyses with 8x2 Antenna Array with Beam Peak on the Measurement Grid

The results shown in this clause are based on the 8x2 antenna array with
the beam peak always aligned on a grid point. For these simulations, the
completely random UE rotations in θ and φ were always re-adjusted to the
next closest measurement grid point.

The results for various measurement grids are tabulated in Table
G.3.3.2.1-1 and plotted in Figure G.3.3.2.1-1. Sample CDF curves of the
EIS~50%CDF~ for some sample grids are shown in Figure G.3.3.2.1-2.

It can be observed that:

\- With the beam peak always aligned on the measurement grid, the
standard deviation of the EIS~50%CDF~ is negligible (\<0.1dB) for more
than \~350 unique measurement points for constant step size grids.

\- The DL power step size has no impact on the standard deviation for
constant-step size measurement grids.

\- With the beam peak always aligned on the measurement grid, the mean
error of the EIS~50%CDF~ roughly matches the DL power step size with
more than \~200 unique measurement points for constant step size grids.

Figure G.3.3.2.1-4: CDF results for the 8x2 antenna array for constant
density measurement grids and the beam peak always aligned on a grid
point. From left to right: 700, 70, and 50 grid points. On top: DL power
step size of 0.1dB, on bottom: DL power step size: 1dB.

It can be observed that:

\- With the beam peak always aligned on the measurement grid, the
standard deviation of the EIS~50%CDF~ is negligible (\<0.1dB) for more
than \~200 unique measurement points for constant density grids (using
the charged particle implementation).

\- The DL power step size has no impact on the standard deviation for
constant density measurement grids.

\- With the beam peak always aligned on the measurement grid, the mean
error of the EIS~50%CDF~ roughly matches the DL power step size with
more than \~200 unique measurement points for constant density grids.

The standard deviations between the constant step size and constant
density grids is shown in Figure G.3.3.2.1-5 for the 8x2 antenna with
the beam peak always placed on a grid point with a DL power step size of
0.1dB.

Figure G.3.3.2.1-5: Comparison of the standard deviation of EIS~50%CDF~
for the 8x2 antenna with the beam peak always placed on a grid point. DL
power step size of 0.1dB.

It can be seen that the constant density measurement grids require
slightly fewer measurement points than the constant step size grids to
achieve the same standard deviation.

#### G.3.3.2.2 Analyses with 8x2 Antenna Array with Beam Peak oriented completely randomly

The results in this clause are based on the 8x2 antenna array with the
beam peak oriented in completely random orientations, i.e., the beam
peak is not always aligned to a grid point. This analysis was performed
to see whether the beam peaks have to be aligned with a grid point if
only the min. EIS value at the 50%-tile CDF is of interest. It is
understood that the CDF curve cannot be used to accurately determine the
RX beam peak (100%-tile CDF).

The results for various constant-step size measurement grids are
tabulated in Table G.3.3.2.2-1.

antenna array for constant step size measurement grids and the beam peak
oriented in completely random orientations.

The standard deviations and mean errors for the constant step size and
constant density grids are shown in Figure G.3.3.2.2-1 and in Figure
G.3.3.2.2-2, respectively, for the 8x2 antenna with the beam peak always
placed on a grid point and with the beam peak placed in completely
random orientations. Figure G.3.3.2.2-3 is looking at the max range of
the 50%-tile CDF EISs which is the difference between the max and the
min 50%-tile CDF EISs.

measurement grid or not.

#### G.3.3.2.3 Conclusions

According to results in clause G.3.3.2.1 and G.3.3.2.2, the following
conclusions can be made:

\- The EIS spherical coverage measurement to be performed without having
to have the beam peak placed on a grid point, e.g., for coarse grids of
beam peak searches.

\- In order to make a reasonable trade-off with measurement
uncertainties, it is recommended to use for spherical coverage grids
with at least 200 unique measurement points, i.e.,

\- constant density grid with at least 200 grid points: STD of 0.1dB and
Mean Error: DL power step size

\- constant step size grid with at least 266 grid points: STD of 0.12dB
and Mean Error: DL power step size

Figure G.3.4-1: Sample CDF Curve for a coarse measurement grid

While for very fine measurement grids, the definition of the min EIRP at
the target CDF, EIRP~target-CDF,~ is pretty clear since the CDF curve is
smooth, the definition of the EIRP value at the respective CDF target
should be clarified for coarse grids with staggered CDF curves. Two
scenarios are outlined in Figure G.3.4-2; Figure G.3.4-2a shows the case
where the CDF is not met with any EIRP value while in Figure G.3.4-2b,
the target CDF is met with one (or more, as illustrated) EIRP values.

For the case shown in Figure G.3.4-2a, min. EIRP at the target CDF shall
be determined based on an interpolation of the CDF curve between the top
of raising edges located right above the CDF target (blue circle) and
right below the target (green circle).

For the case where the target CDF is met with one or more EIRP value, as
illustrated in Figure G.3.4-2b, min. EIRP at the target CDF shall be
determined as the min. EIRP value that meets the CDF target.

Figure G.3.4-2: Illustration of CDF scenarios, a) CDF target is not met
with any EIRP value, b) CDF target is met with one or more EIRP values.

It can be concluded that, for the case when the target CDF is not met
with any EIRP values, the min. EIRP at the target CDF is determined
based on an interpolation of the CDF curve between the raising edges
located right above the CDF target and right below the target. For the
case where the target CDF is met with one more or EIRP value, define the
min. EIRP at the target CDF as the min. EIRP value that meets the CDF
target.

G.4 Combined Beam Peak and Spherical Coverage Analyses
======================================================

Since the beam peak does not have to be aligned on the spherical
coverage grid for spherical coverage analyses (as described in clause
G.3), the EIRP/EIS results from the EIRP/EIS beam peak search using
single fine grids (as described in clause G.2) could be re-used for
EIRP/EIS spherical coverage which could further reduce the EIRP/EIS
spherical coverage MU.

Coarse EIRP/EIS beam peak searches (as described in clause G.2.3) can be
used for EIRP/EIS spherical coverage analyses as long as they meet the
minimum number of measurement points (200 grid points for constant
density using the charged particle implementation and 266 for constant
step size). As the fine grid points in the coarse & fine grid approach
are localized near maximum beam peaks, only the results from the coarse
search grid can be used for the CDF analyses.

Subsequent fine search approaches using constant step size grids used to
determine the EIRP/EIS beam peaks require a minimum step size of 7.5º.

Subsequent fine search approaches using constant density grids used to
determine the EIRP/EIS beam peaks require at least 6 points around the
peak identified with the coarse grid, with a spacing corresponding to a
constant density (using the charged particle implementation) over the
whole sphere of at least 800 points.

Therefore, EIRP/EIS spherical coverage requirement can be verified using
the results from the corresponding EIRP/EIS coarse beam peak search.

########  Annex H: SINR control for Scenario 3 RRM Test with two Angles of Arrival (2 AoAs)

H.1 Case 1: TDM transmissions from 2 probes
===========================================

For Scenario 3 with 2AoA for both Mode 1 and Mode 2, the methods are
same as the Scenario 1 and Scenario 2 with 1AoA.

H.2 Case 2: Simultaneous transmission of signals from 2 probes
==============================================================

H.2.1 Mode 1
------------

For Mode 1, the SINR equation for signal from probe 1 at baseband is
given as follows:

${SINR1}_{\text{BB}} = \frac{S1*G1*Loss}{\left( S2 + N \right)G2*Loss + N*G1*Loss + Noise\_ floor}$

Where S1 and S2 are signal level for probe 1 and probe 2 respectively.
G1 and G2 are the antenna gain for probe 1 and probe 2 respectively.
Loss is the pathloss between probe 1&2 and DUT. Noise\_floor is the
total noise at DUT baseband receiver. N is the artificial noise at the
reference point for probe 1 and 2 (artificial noise level is identical
for probe 1 and probe 2).

Since the wanted noise is set 6dB above UE thermal noise, therefore the
total noise of baseband Noise\_floor can be ignored when calculating the
SINR. And the SINR can be rewritten as:

${SINR1}_{\text{BB}} \approx \frac{S1*G1*Loss}{\left( S2 + N \right)G2*Loss + N*G1*Loss} = \frac{1}{\left( \frac{S2}{S1} + \frac{1}{\text{SNR}1} \right)*\frac{G2}{G1} + \frac{1}{\text{SNR}1}}$

Where SNR1 is the SNR from probe 1, and the key parameter affecting the
SINR at baseband is G2/G1.

However, it is difficult to obtain the exact G2/G1 value since it
depends on UE implementation, relative probe spacing, and relative probe
and DUT orientation. The lower bound of SINR can be derived under
assumption on maximum antenna gains difference G2/G1 is determined. For
power class 3 UE in Band n260, the lower bound of G1/G2 can be roughly
assessed to be below \[-10\] dB.

H.2.1 Mode 2
------------

For Mode 2, the SINR for signal from probe 1 at baseband is given as
follows:

${SINR1}_{\text{BB}} = \frac{S1*G1*Loss}{S2*G2*Loss + Noise\_ floor}$

If we set the signal level from interfering probe at reference point is
6dB higher than UE thermal noise, then the approximate SINR can be
rewritten as follows:

$SINR1 \approx \frac{S1}{S2*G2/G1}$

Same as for Mode 1, for power class 3 UE in Band n260, the lower bound
of G1/G2 can be roughly assessed to be below \[-10\] dB.
