GSM/UMTS networks. The GSM/UMTS core network-charging architecture and
principles are specified in TS 32.240 \[1\], which provides an umbrella
for other charging management documents that specify.

\- The content of the CDRs\' per domain and subsystem (offline
charging);

\- The content of real-time charging messages per domain / subsystem
(online charging);

\- The functionality of online and offline charging for those domains
and subsystems;

\- The interfaces that are used in the charging framework to transfer
the charging information (i.e. CDRs or charging events).

The complete document structure for these TSs is defined in TS 32.240
\[1\].

The present document specifies in detail the Diameter based offline and
online charging applications for 3GPP networks. It includes all charging
parameters, scenarios and message flows..

All terms, definitions and, abbreviations used in the present document,
that are common across 3GPP TSs, are defined in TR 21.905 \[100\]. Those
that are common across charging management in GSM/UMTS domains, services
or subsystems are provided in the umbrella document TS 32.240 \[1\] and
are copied into clause 3 of the present document for ease of reading.
Finally, those items that are specific to the present document are

3 Definitions, symbols and abbreviations
========================================

3.1 Definitions
---------------

For the purposes of the present document, the terms and definitions
given in TR 21.905 \[100\] and the following apply. A term defined in
the present document takes precedence over the definition of the same
term, if any, in TR 21.905 \[100\].

**middle tier TS:** term used for the 3GPP charging TSs that specify the
domain / subsystem / service specific, online and offline, charging
functionality. These are all the TSs in the numbering range from TS
32.250 to TS 32.27x, e.g. TS 32.250 \[10\] for the CS domain, or TS
32.270 \[30\] for the MMS service. Currently, there is only one \"tier
1\" TS in 3GPP, which is the TS 32.240 that specifies the charging
architecture and principles. Finally, there are a number of top tier TSs
in the 32.29x numbering range (\[50\] ff) that specify common charging
aspects such as parameter definitions, encoding rules, the common
billing domain interface or common charging applications.

**offline charging:** charging mechanism where charging information
**does not** affect, in real-time, the service rendered

**online charging:** charging mechanism where charging information can
affect, in real-time, the service rendered and therefore a direct
interaction of the charging mechanism with session/service control is
required

4 Architecture considerations
=============================

4.1 High level architecture
---------------------------

### 4.1.0 General

The Rf and the Ro are reference points from the Charging Trigger
Function (CTF) to the Charging Data Function (CDF) and the Online
Charging Function (OCF) respectively, and are intended for the transport
of charging events. Rf is used for offline charging whereas Ro is used
for online charging.\
Figure 4.1.0.1 and figure 4.1.0.2 depict the position of the Rf and Ro
reference points within the overall 3GPP online and offline charging
architecture.

**CTF:** **C**harging **T**rigger **F**unction

**CDF:** **C**harging **D**ata **F**unction

**CGF:** **C**harging **G**ateway **F**unction

**BD:** **B**illing **D**omain. This may also be a billing mediation
device / post-processing system.

**BD:** **B**illing **D**omain. This may also be a billing mediation
device / post-processing system.

Figure 4.1.0.2: Logical ubiquitous online charging architecture

Different mappings of the ubiquitous offline charging functions, CTF,
CDF and CGF, onto physical implementations are possible. Further details
of the configuration refer toTS 32.240 \[1\]. Details of the
implementation options per domain / subsystem / service (usually a
subset of the overall possible variants described above) are specified
in the respective middle tier TSs.

### 4.1.1 Charging related transfer requirements

Each CTF would have CDF and OCF address list to which it can send its
charging events and/or charging requests.\
The list is organized in address priority order. If the primary charging
function is not available (e.g. out of service) then the CTF shall send
the charging information to the secondary charging function and so on.

Within the scope of this release, each Network Element that generates
charging information sends the information only to the charging entities
of the same PLMN, and not to charging entities in other PLMNs.\
To implement roaming unbundling for EU roaming regulation III, an
architectural solution known as the Single IMSI architecture has been
defined. In this architecture a specific Service-NE (known as a Proxy
Function) uses the Ro reference point for sending charging information
to an OCF in another network. The details of this architecture are
defined in Annex B of TS 32.240 \[1\].

To implement PS domain online charging for roaming context, PCEF in the
VPLMN uses the Gy reference point, and TDF in the VPLMN uses the Gyn
reference point, both based on Ro interface and specified in TS
32.251\[11\], for sending charging information to an OCS in the HPLMN. A
simplified profile is provided in Annex E of TS 32.251\[11\] for
deployment purposes.

Each CDF in the PLMN may know of other CDFs\' network addresses (e.g.,
for redundancy reasons, to be able to recommend another CDF address with
the Redirection Request message). This is achieved by OAM&P
configuration facilities that enables each CDF to have a configurable
list of peer CDF addresses.

5 3GPP charging applications requirements
=========================================

5.1 Offline charging scenarios
------------------------------

### 5.1.1 Basic principles

#### 5.1.1.0 Introduction

Offline charging for both events and sessions between CTF and the CDF is
performed using the Rf reference point as defined in TS 32.240 \[1\].

Two basic scenarios are used:

\- Event based charging;

\- Session based charging.

#### 5.1.1.1 Event based charging

In scenario figure 5.1.1.1.1, CTF asks the CDF to store event related
charging data.

Figure 5.1.1.1.1: Event based charging

**1) Request for resource usage:** UE-A requests the desired resource
from the Network Element.

**2) Content/Service Delivery:** the Network Element delivers the
content/service.

**3) Charging Data Generation:** the CTF generates charging data related
to service delivery.

**4) Record Charging Data Request:** the CTF requests the CDF to store
event related charging data for CDR generation purposes.

**5) Process Request:** CDF stores received information. Whether the CDR
is generated or not depends on CDR generation configuration.

**6) Record Charging Data Response:** the CDF informs the CTF that
charging data was stored.

#### 5.1.1.2 Session based charging

In scenario figure 5.1.1.2.1, CTF asks the CDF to store session related
charging data.

Figure 5.1.1.2.1: Session based charging

**1) Request for resource usage:** UE-A requests the desired session
from the Network Element.

**2) Session ongoing:** the Network Element establish the session.

**3) Charging Data Generation:** the CTF generates charging data related
to session.

**4) Record Charging Data Request:** the CTF requests the CDF to store
session related charging data for CDR generation purposes.

**5) Process Request:** CDF stores received information. Whether the CDR
is generated or not depends on CDR generation configuration.

**6) Record Charging Data Response:** the CDF informs the CTF that
charging data was stored.

**7) Charging Data Generation:** the CTF generates charging data related
to session due of e.g. intermediate timer expiry.

**8) Record Charging Data Request:** the CTF requests the CDF to store
session related charging data for CDR generation purposes.

**9) Process Request:** CDF stores received information. Whether the CDR
is generated or not depends on CDR generation configuration.

**10) Record Charging Data Response:** the CDF informs the CTF that
charging data was stored.

**11) Session release:** the session is released.

**12) Charging Data Generation:** the CTF generates charging data
related to session due of session termination.

**13) Record Charging Data Request:** the CTF requests the CDF to store
session related charging data for CDR generation purposes.

**14) Process Request:** CDF stores received information. Whether the
CDR is generated or not depends on CDR generation configuration.

**15) Record Charging Data Response:** the CDF informs the CTF that
charging data was stored.

### 5.1.2 Basic operation

Event and session based Charging are performed by the use of the
\"*Charging Data Transfer*\" operation:

\- \"*Charging Data Request*\"; sent from CTF  CDF\
After detecting a chargeable event, the CTF sends a Charging Data
Request to the CDF.

\- \"*Charging Data Response*\"; sent from CDF  CTF\
The CDF replies with a Charging Data Response, which informs the CTF
that charging data was received.

Table 5.1.2.1 and table 5.1.2.2 describe the content of these
operations.

Table 5.1.2.1: Charging Data Request content

5.2 Online charging scenarios
-----------------------------

### 5.2.0 Introduction

Online charging for both events and sessions between CTF and the OCF is
performed using the Ro reference point. The Ro reference point supports
integrity protection and authentication for the case that the CTF is
outside the operator domain.

### 5.2.1 Basic principles

There are two sub-functions for online charging that affect online
charging principles and require a more detailed description: rating and
unit determination. Both rating and unit determination can be
implemented centralized, i.e. on the OCF, or decentralized, that is, on
the CTF.

Unit determination refers to the calculation of the number of
non-monetary units (service units, data volume, time and events) that
shall be assigned prior to starting service delivery.

\- With Centralized Unit Determination, the OCF determines the number of
non-monetary units that a certain service user can consume based on a
service key received from the CTF.

\- With the Decentralized Unit Determination approach, the CTF
determines itself how many units are required to start service delivery,
and requests these units from the OCF.

After checking the service user\'s account balance, the OCF returns the
number of granted units to the CTF. The CTF is then responsible for the
supervision of service delivery. Particularly, the CTF shall limit
service delivery to the corresponding number of granted units.

Rating refers to the calculation of a price out of the non-monetary
units calculated by the unit determination function.

\- With the Centralized Rating approach, the CTF and the OCF exchange
information about non-monetary units. The OCF translates these units
into monetary units.

\- With the Decentralized Rating approach, the corresponding rating
control is performed within the CTF. Consequently, CTF and OCF exchange
information about monetary units.

Three cases for online charging can be distinguished: Immediate Event
Charging (IEC), Event Charging with Unit Reservation (ECUR) and Session
Charging with Unit Reservation (SCUR). These cases are further described
in TS 32.240 \[1\].

### 5.2.2 Charging scenarios

#### 5.2.2.0 Introduction

### 5.2.3 Basic operations

Online Credit-Control uses two basic logical operations: Debit Units and
Reserve Units.

\- \"*Debit Units Request*\"; sent from CTF  OCF\
After receiving a service request from the subscriber, the CTF sends a
*Debit Units Request* to the OCF.\
The CTF may either specify a service key (centralised unit
determination) or the number of units requested (decentralised unit
determination).\
For refund purpose, the CTF sends a *Debit Units Request* to the OCF as
well.

\- \"*Debit Units Response*\"; sent from OCF  CTF\
The OCF replies with a *Debit Units Response*, which informs the CTF of
the number of units granted as a result of the *Debit Units Request*.
This includes the case where the number of units granted indicates the
permission to render the requested service.\
For refund purpose, the OCF replies with a *Debit Units Response*.

\- \"*Reserve Units Request*\"; sent from CTF  OCF\
Request to reserve a number of units for the service to be provided by
an CTF. In case of centralized unit determination, the CTF specifies a
service key in the *Reserve Unit Request*, and the OCF determines the
number of units requested. In case of decentralised unit determination,
the number of units requested is specified by the CTF.

\- \"*Reserve Units Response*\"; sent from OCF  CTF\
Response from the OCF which informs the CTF of the number of units that
were reserved as a result of the \"*Reserve Units Request*\".

IEC uses the Direct Debiting One Time Event procedure specified in RFC
4006 \[402\] and therefore is performed by the use of the logical
\"Debit Units\" operation, as specified in clause 6.3.3.

SCUR and ECUR use both the \"Debit Units\" and \"Reserve Units\"
operations.

SCUR uses the Session Based Credit-Control procedure specified in RFC
4006 \[402\]. In session charging with unit reservation, when the
\"Debit Units\" and \"Reserve Units\" operations are both needed, they
shall be combined in one message, as specified in clause 6.3.5.

For SCUR and ECUR the consumed units are deducted from the subscriber\'s
account after service delivery.\
Thus, the reserved and consumed units are not necessarily the same.
Using this operation, it is also possible for the CTF to modify the
current reservation, including the return of previously reserved units.

Table 5.2.3.1 and table 5.2.3.2 describe the content of these
operations.

5.3 Other requirements
----------------------

### 5.3.1 Re-authorization

The server may specify an idle timeout associated with a granted quota.
Alternatively, the client may have a configurable default value. The
expiry of that timer shall trigger a re-authorization request.

Mid-session service events (re-authorization triggers) may affect the
rating of the current service usage.\
The server may instruct the Credit-Control client to re-authorize the
quota upon a number of different session related triggers that can
affect the rating conditions.

When a re-authorization is trigger, the client shall reports quota
usage. The reason for the quota being reported shall be notified to the
server.

### 5.3.2 Threshold based re-authorization triggers

The server may optionally include an indication to the client of the
remaining quota threshold that shall trigger a quota re-authorization.

### 5.3.3 Termination action

The server may specify to the client the behaviour on consumption of the
final granted units, or zero units granted in the first place; this is
known as termination action.

### 5.3.4 Account expiration

The server may provide to the client the date and time of account
expiration, which the client may use depending on operator policy.

6 3GPP charging applications -- Protocol aspects
================================================

6.1 Basic principles for Diameter offline charging
--------------------------------------------------

### 6.1.0 Introduction

In order to support the offline charging principles described in the
present document, the Diameter client and server shall implement at
least the following Diameter options listed in RFC 6733 \[401\], i.e.
the basic functionality of Diameter accounting, as defined by the
Diameter Base Protocol (RFC 6733 \[401\]) is re-used.

The charging architecture implementing Diameter adheres to the structure
where all communications for offline charging purposes between the CTF
(Diameter client) and the CDF (Diameter server) are carried out on the
Diameter Rf reference point, where the CTF reports charging information
to the Charging Data Function (CDF). The CDF uses this information to
construct and format CDRs. The above-mentioned reference points are
defined in TS 32.240 \[1\].

A configurable timer is supported in the CDF to supervise the reception
of the ACR\[Interim\] and/or ACR\[Stop\]. An instance of the \"Timer\"
is started at the beginning of the accounting session, reset on the
receipt of an ACR\[Interim\] and stopped at the reception of the
ACR\[Stop\]. Upon expiration of the timer, the CDF stops the accounting
session with the appropriate error indication.

For offline charging, the CTF implements the accounting state machine
described in RFC 6733 \[401\].\
The server (CDF) implements the accounting state machine \"SERVER,
STATELESS ACCOUNTING\" as specified in RFC 6733 \[401\], i.e. there is
no order in which the server expects to receive the accounting
information.

The offline charging functionality is based on the Network Elements
reporting accounting information upon reception of various messages
which trigger charging generation, as most of the accounting relevant
information is contained in these messages. This reporting is achieved
by sending Diameter *Accounting Requests* (ACR) \[start, interim, stop
and event\] from the Network Elements to the CDF.

Following the Diameter base protocol specification, the following
\"types\" of accounting data may be sent with regard to offline
charging:

-   START session accounting data.

-   INTERIM session accounting data.

-   STOP session accounting data.

-   EVENT accounting data.

Two cases are currently distinguished for offline charging purposes:

-   Event based charging; and

-   Session based charging.

ACR types START, INTERIM and STOP are used for accounting data related
to successful sessions. In contrast, EVENT accounting data is unrelated
to sessions, and is used e.g. for a simple registration or interrogation
and successful service event triggered by a Network Element. In
addition, EVENT accounting data is also used for unsuccessful session
establishment attempts.

The flows and scenarios for the above two described cases are further
detailed below.

### 6.1.1 Event based charging

In the case of event based charging, the network reports the usage or
the service rendered where the service offering is rendered in a single
operation. It is reported using the ACR\[Event\].

Figure 6.1.1.1 shows the transactions that are required on the Diameter
offline interface in order to perform event based charging. The
operation may alternatively be carried out prior to, concurrently with
or after service/content delivery.

Figure 6.1.1.1: Event based offline charging

> Step 1: The Network Element receives indication that service has been
> used/delivered.
>
> Step 2: The Network Element (acting as client) sends
> Accounting-Request (ACR) with Accounting-Record-Type AVP set to
> EVENT\_RECORD to indicate service specific information to the CDF
> (acting as server).
>
> Step 3: The CDF receives the relevant service charging parameters and
> processes accounting request.
>
> Step 4: The CDF returns Accounting-Answer message with
> Accounting-Record-Type AVP set to EVENT\_RECORD to the Network Element
> in order to inform that charging information was received.

### 6.1.2 Session based charging

Session based charging is the process of reporting usage reports for a
session and uses the START, INTERIM and STOP accounting data. During a
session, a Network Element may transmit multiple ACR Interims\'
depending on the proceeding of the session.

Figure 6.1.2.1 shows the transactions that are required on the Diameter
offline interface in order to perform session based charging.

Figure 6.1.2.1: Session based offline charging

> Step 1: The Network Element receives a service request. The service
> request may be initiated either by the user or the other Network
> Element.
>
> Step 2: In order to start accounting session, the Network Element
> sends a Accounting-Request (ACR) with Accounting-Record-Type AVP set
> to START\_RECORD to the CDF.

Step 3: The CDF opens a CDR for current session.

> Step 4: The CDF returns Accounting-Answer (ACA) message with
> Accounting-Record-Type set to START\_RECORD to the Network Element and
> possibly Acct-Interim-Interval AVP (AII) set to non-zero value
> indicating the desired intermediate charging interval.
>
> Step 5: When either AII elapses or charging conditions changes are
> recognized at Network Element (NE), the NE sends an Accounting-Request
> (ACR) with Accounting-Record-Type AVP set to INTERIM\_RECORD to the
> CDF.

Step 6: The CDF updates the CDR in question.

> Step 7: The CDF returns Accounting-Answer (ACA) message with
> Accounting-Record-Type set to INTERIM\_RECORD to the Network Element.
>
> Step 8: The service is terminated.
>
> Step 9: The Network Element sends a Accounting-Request (ACR) with
> Accounting-Record-Type AVP set to STOP\_RECORD to the CDF.
>
> Step 10: The CDF updates the CDR accordingly and closes the CDR.
>
> Step 11: The CDF returns Accounting-Answer (ACA) message with
> Accounting-Record-Type set to STOP\_RECORD to the Network Element.

### 6.1.3 Offline charging error cases - Diameter procedures

#### 6.1.3.1 CDF connection failure

When the connection towards the primary CDF is broken, the process of
sending accounting information should continue towards a secondary CDF
(if such a CDF is configured). For further CDF connection failure
functionality, see clause \"*Transport Failure Detection*\" in the RFC
6733 \[401\].

If no CDF is reachable the Network Element may buffer the generated
accounting data in non-volatile memory. Once the CDF connection is
working again, all accounting messages stored in the buffer is sent to
the CDF, in the order they were stored in the buffer.

#### 6.1.3.2 No reply from CDF

In case a Network Element does not receive an ACA in response to an ACR,
it may retransmit the ACR message. The waiting time until a
retransmission is sent, and the maximum number of repetitions are both
configurable by the operator. When the maximum number of retransmissions
is reached and still no ACA reply has been received, the Network Element
executes the CDF connection failure procedure as specified above.

If retransmitted ACRs\' are sent, they are marked with the T-flag as
described in RFC 6733 \[401\], in order to allow duplicate detection in
the CDF, as specified in the next clause 6.1.3.3.

#### 6.1.3.3 Duplicate detection

A Diameter client marks possible duplicate request messages (e.g.
retransmission due to the link fail over process) with the T-flag as
described in RFC 6733 \[401\].

If the CDF receives a message that is marked as retransmitted and this
message was already received, then it discards the duplicate message.
However, if the original of the re-transmitted message was not yet
received, it is the information in the marked message that is taken into
account when generating the CDR. The CDRs are marked if information from
duplicated message(s) is used.

#### 6.1.3.4 CDF detected failure

The CDF closes a CDR when it detects that expected Diameter ACRs for a
particular session have not been received for a period of time. The
exact behaviour of the CDF is operator configurable.

6.2 Message contents for offline charging
-----------------------------------------

### 6.2.1 Summary of offline charging message formats

#### 6.2.1.1 General

The corresponding Diameter accounting application messages for the
Charging Data Transfer operation is Accounting-Request (ACR) and
Accounting-Answer (ACA) as specified in the Diameter Base Protocol
Accounting (DBPA) application in RFC 6733 \[401\].

Table 6.2.1.1.1 describes the use of these messages which are adapted
for 3GPP offline charging.

Table 6.2.1.1.1: Offline charging messages reference table

  ------------------------------- -------- ------------- --------------
  Command-Name                    Source   Destination   Abbreviation
  Accounting-Request              CTF      CDF           ACR
  Accounting-Answer               CDF      CTF           ACA
  Capabilities-Exchange-Request   CTF      CDF           CER
  Capabilities-Exchange-Answer    CDF      CTF           CEA
  ------------------------------- -------- ------------- --------------

Additional Diameter messages (i.e. DPR/DPA, DWR/DWA)are used according
to the Diameter Base Protocol Accounting (DBPA) specification in RFC
6733 \[401\].

#### 6.2.1.2 Structure for the Accounting message formats

The following is the basic structure shared by all offline charging
messages. This is based directly on the format of the messages defined
in the Diameter Base Protocol Application specification in RFC 6733
\[401\].

Those Diameter Accounting AVPs that are used for 3GPP offline charging
are marked in table 6.2.2.1 and table 6.2.3.1 with a category as
specified in TS 32.240 \[1\].

An AVP in grey strikethrough in the message format (in grey in the
tables) is not used by 3GPP.

The following symbols are used in the message format definition:

\- \<AVP\> indicates a mandatory AVP with a fixed position in the
message.

\- {AVP} indicates a mandatory AVP in the message.

\- \[AVP\] indicates an optional AVP in the message.

\- \*AVP indicates that multiple occurrences of an AVP is possible.

### 6.2.2 Accounting-Request message

The ACR messages, indicated by the Command-Code field set to 271 is sent
by the CTF to the CDF in order to send charging information for the
requested bearer / subsystem /service.

The ACR message format is defined according to the Diameter Base
Protocol in RFC 6733 \[401\] as follows:

\<ACR\> ::= \< Diameter Header: 271, REQ, PXY \>

6.3 Basic principles for Diameter online charging
-------------------------------------------------

### 6.3.1 Online Specific Credit-Control application requirements

For online charging, the basic functionality as defined by the IETF
Diameter Credit-Control Application is used.\
The basic structure follows a mechanism where the online client (CTF)
requests resource allocation and reports Credit-Control information to
the Online Charging System (OCS).

The usage and values of *Validity-Time* AVP and the timer \"Tcc\" are
under the sole control of the Credit-Control server (OCS) and determined
by operator configuration of the OCS.

The online client implements the state machine described in RFC 4006
\[402\] for \"CLIENT, EVENT BASED\" and/or \"CLIENT, SESSION BASED\".
I.e. when the client applies IEC it uses the \"CLIENT, EVENT BASED\"
state machine, and when the client applies ECUR defined in 3GPP it uses
the \"CLIENT, SESSION BASED\" state machine for the first and final
interrogations.

The OCS implements the state machine described in RFC 4006 \[402\] for
the \"SERVER, SESSION AND EVENT BASED\" in order to support Immediate
Event Charging and Event Charging with Unit Reservation.

### 6.3.2 Diameter description on the Ro reference point

#### 6.3.2.1 Basic principles

For online charging the Diameter Credit-Control Application (DCCA)
defined in RFC 4006 \[402\] is used with additional AVPs defined in the
present document.

Three cases for control of user credit for online charging are
distinguished:

\- Immediate Event Charging IEC; and

\- event charging with unit reservation (ECUR).

\- Session Charging with Unit Reservation (SCUR)

In the case of Immediate Event Charging (IEC),the Credit-Control process
for events is controlled by the corresponding *CC-Requested-Type*
EVENT\_REQUEST that is sent with Credit*-Control-Request (*CCR) for a
given Credit-Control event.

In the case of Event Charging with Unit Reservation (ECUR) the
*CC-Request-Type* INITIAL / TERMINATION\_REQUEST are used for charging
for a given Credit-Control event, however, where a reservation is made
prior to service delivery and committed on execution of a successful
delivery.

Session Charging with Unit Reservation is used for Credit-Control of
sessions and uses the *CC-Request-Type* INITIAL / UPDATE and
TERMINATION\_REQUEST.

The Network Element may apply IEC, where CCR event messages are
generated, or ECUR, using CCR Initial and Termination. The decision
whether to apply IEC or ECUR is based on the service and/or operator\'s
policy.

### 6.3.3 Immediate Event Charging (IEC)

Figure 6.3.3.1 shows the transactions that are required on the Ro
reference point in order to perform event based Direct Debiting
operation. The Direct Debiting operation may alternatively be carried
out prior to service/content delivery.\
the Network Element shall ensure that the requested service execution is
successful, when this scenario is used.

NOTE: It is possible to perform also, CHECK\_BALANCE and PRICE\_ENQUIRY
using above described mechanism RFC 4006 \[402\].

### 6.3.4 Event Charging with Unit Reservation (ECUR)

Figure 6.3.4.1 shows the transactions that are required on the Ro
reference point in order to perform the ECUR. ECUR is used when event
charging needs separate reserve and commit actions.

NOTE: This scenario is supervised by corresponding timers (e.g. validity
time timer) that are not shown in the figure 6.3.4.1.

### 6.3.5 Session Charging with Unit Reservation (SCUR)

NOTE: This scenario is supervised by corresponding timers (e.g. validity
time timer) that are not shown in figure 6.3.5.1.

### 6.3.6 Error cases and scenarios

#### 6.3.6.0 Introduction

This clause describes various error cases and how these should be
handled.

The failure handling behaviour is locally configurable in the Network
Element. If the *Direct-Debiting-Failure-Handling* or
*Credit-Control-Failure-Handling* AVP is not used, the locally
configured values are used instead.

#### 6.3.6.1 Duplicate detection

The detection of duplicate request is needed and shall be enabled. To
speed up and simplify as much as possible the duplicate detection, the
all-against-all record checking should be avoided and just those records
marked as potential duplicates need to be checked against other received
requests (in real-time ) by the receiver entity.

The Network Element marks the request messages that are retransmitted
after a link fail over as possible duplicates with the T-flag as
described in RFC 6733 \[401\]. For optimized performance, uniqueness
checking against other received requests is only necessary for those
records marked with the T-flag received within a reasonable time window.
This focused check is based on the inspection of the *Session-Id* and
*CC-Request-Number* AVP pairs.

Note that for EBCC the duplicate detection is performed in the
Correlation Function that is part of the OCS.\
The OCS that receives the possible duplicate request should mark as
possible duplicate the corresponding request that is sent over the
\'Rc\' reference point. However, this assumption above is for further
study and needs to be clarified.

For Credit-Control duplicate detection, please refer to the Diameter
Credit-Control.

#### 6.3.6.2 Reserve Units / Debit Units operation failure

In the case of an OCS connection failure, and/or receiving error
responses from the OCS, please refer to RFC 6733 \[401\] and RFC 4006
\[402\] for failure handling descriptions.

### 6.3.7 Support of tariff changes during an active user session

#### 6.3.7.1 Support of tariff changes using the tariff switch mechanism

After a tariff switch has been reached, all the active user sessions
shall report their session usage by the end of the validity period of
the current request and receive new quota for resource usage for the new
tariff period.

In order to avoid the need for mass simultaneous quota refresh, the
traffic usage can be split into resource usage before a tariff switch
and resources used after a tariff switch.

The Tariff-Time-Change AVP is used to determine the tariff switch time
as described by RFC 4006 \[402\].\
In addition to the scenarios described in RFC 4006 \[402\], the
Tariff-Time-Change AVP may also be used in the context of continuously
time-based charging.

The Tariff-Change-Usage AVP is used within the Used-Service-Units AVP to
distinguish reported usage before and after the tariff time change.

The Tariff-Change-Usage AVP is not used directly within the
Multiple-Services-Credit-Control AVP.

#### 6.3.7.2 Support of tariff changes using Validity-Time AVP

Changes to the tariffs pertaining to the service during active user
sessions may also be handled using the Validity Time AVP.

NOTE: RFC 4006 \[402\] does not directly describe how tariff changes are
handled with validity time.\
If validity time is used for tariff time changes it might overload the
client and the server.

### 6.3.8 Support of re-authorization

Mid Diameter CC session re-authorizations of multiple active resource
quotas within a DCC session can be achieved using a single Diameter
*Credit-Control- Request/ Credit-Control- Answer* message sequence.

The OCS may also re-authorize multiple active resource quotas within a
DCC session by using a single Diameter *Re-Auth-Request/Answer* message
sequence.

New quota allocations received by the Network Element override any
remaining held quota resources after accounting for any resource usage
while the re-authorization was in progress.

### 6.3.9 Support of failure handling

The Credit-Control-Failure-Handling AVP as defined in RFC 4006 \[402\]
determines what to do if the sending of Diameter credit-control messages
to the OCS has been temporarily prevented. The usage of
Credit-Control-Failure-Handling AVP gives flexibility to have different
failure handling for credit-control session.

This AVP may be received from the OCS or may be locally configured. The
value received from the OCS in the Diameter CCA message always override
any already existing value.

As defined in RFC 4006 \[402\], the Tx timer is introduced to limit the
waiting time in the CTF for an answer to the CCR sent to the OCS. When
the Tx timer elapses the CTF takes an action to the end user according
to the value of the Credit-Control-Failure-Handling AVP.

It is possible that several concurrent CCR messages are triggered for
the same online charging session. In this case, each CCR message shall
reset the Tx timer as defined in RFC 4006 \[402\].

### 6.3.10 Support of failover

As defined in RFC 4006 \[402\] if a failure occurs during an ongoing
credit-control session, the CTF may move the Credit-Control message
stream to an alternative OCS if the primary OCS indicated
FAILOVER\_SUPPORTED in the CC-Session-Failover AVP. In case
CC-Session-Failover AVP is set to FAILOVER\_NOT SUPPORTED the
Credit-Control message stream is not moved to a backup OCS.

For new Credit-Control sessions, failover to an alternative OCS should
be performed if possible. For instance, if an implementation of the CTF
can determine primary OCS unavailability it can establish the new
Credit-Control sessions with a possibly available secondary OCS.

Since the OCS has to maintain session states, moving the credit-control
message stream to a backup OCS requires a complex charging context
transfer solution. This charging context transfer mechanism by OCS is
out of the scope of the 3GPP standardization work.

### 6.3.11 Credit pooling

Credit pooling shall be supported as described in TS 32.240 \[1\].

NOTE: Credit pooling is not applicable to IEC since there is no quota
management between CTF and OCF.

6.4 Message formats for online charging
---------------------------------------

### 6.4.1 Summary of online charging message formats

#### 6.4.1.1 General

The corresponding Diameter Credit-Control application messages for the
Debit / Reserve Unit Request operation is Credit-Control-Request (CCR)
and for the Debit / Reserve Unit Response operation is
Credit-Control-Answer (CCA) as specified in RFC 4006 \[402\].

The Diameter Credit-Control Application (DCCA) specifies an approach
based on a series of \"interrogations\":

1\. Initial interrogation.

2\. Zero, one or more interim interrogations.

3\. Final interrogation.

In addition to a series of interrogations, also a one time event
(interrogation) can be used e.g. in the case when service execution is
always successful.

All of these interrogations use CCR and CCA messages. The CCR for the
\"interim interrogation\" and \"final interrogation\" reports the actual
number of \"units\" that were used, from what was previously reserved.
This determines the actual amount debited from the subscriber\'s
account.

Table 6.4.1.1.1 describes the use of these Diameter messages which are
adapted for 3GPP online charging.

Table 6.4.1.1.1: Online charging messages reference table

  ------------------------------- -------- ------------- --------------
  Command-Name                    Source   Destination   Abbreviation
  Credit-Control-Request          CTF      OCS           CCR
  Credit-Control-Answer           OCS      CTF           CCA
  Capabilities-Exchange-Request   CTF      OCS           CER
  Capabilities-Exchange-Answer    OCS      CTF           CEA
  ------------------------------- -------- ------------- --------------

Additional Diameter messages (i.e. ASR/ASA, DPR/DPA, DWR/DWA, RAR/RAA)
are used according to the Diameter Base Protocol Accounting (DBPA)
specification in RFC 6733 \[401\] and to the DCCA specification in RFC
4006 \[402\].

#### 6.4.1.2 Structure for the Credit-Control message formats

The following is the basic structure shared by all online charging
messages. This is based directly on the format of the messages defined
in RFC 4006 \[402\].

Those Diameter accounting AVPs that are used for 3GPP online charging
are marked in the table of contents 6.4.2 and 6.4.3 with a category as
specified in TS 32.240 \[1\].

In the definition of the Diameter commands, the AVPs that are specified
in the referenced specifications but not used by the 3GPP charging
specifications are marked with strikethrough, e.g. ~~\[
Acct-Multi-Session-Id \]~~.

The following symbols are used in the message format definitions:

\- \<AVP\> indicates a mandatory AVP with a fixed position in the
message.

\- {AVP} indicates a mandatory AVP in the message.

\- \[AVP\] indicates an optional AVP in the message.

\- \*AVP indicates that multiple occurrences of an AVP is possible.

### 6.4.2 Credit-Control-Request message

The CCR messages, indicated by the Command-Code field set to 272 is sent
by the CTF to the OCF in order to request credits for the request bearer
/ subsystem /service.

The CCR message format is defined according to RFC 4006 \[402\] as
follows:

\<CCR\> ::= \< Diameter Header: 272, REQ, PXY \>

**\<** Session-Id \>

{ Origin-Host }

{ Origin-Realm }

{ Destination-Realm }

{ Auth-Application-Id }

{ Service-Context-Id }

{ CC-Request-Type }

{ CC-Request-Number }

\[ Destination-Host \]

\[ User-Name \]

~~\[ CC-Sub-Session-Id \]~~

~~\[ Acct-Multi-Session-Id \]~~

\[ Origin-State-Id \]

\[ Event-Timestamp \]

\*\[ Subscription-Id \]

~~\[ Service-Identifier \]~~

\[ Termination-Cause \]

~~\[ Requested-Service-Unit \]~~

\[ Requested-Action \]

~~\*\[ Used-Service-Unit \]~~

\[ AoC-Request-Type \]

\[ Multiple-Services-Indicator \]

\*\[ Multiple-Services-Credit-Control \]

~~\*\[ Service-Parameter-Info \]~~

\[ CC-Correlation-Id \]

\[ User-Equipment-Info \]

\[ OC-Supported-Features \]

\*\[ Proxy-Info \]

\*\[ Route-Record \]

\[ Service-Information \]

\*\[ AVP \]

### 6.4.3 Credit-Control-Answer message

The CCA messages, indicated by the Command-Code field set to 272 is sent
by the OCF to the CTF in order to reply to the CCR.

The CCA message format is defined according to RFC 4006 \[402\] as
follows:

\<CCA\> ::= \< Diameter Header: 272, PXY \>

\< Session-Id \>

{ Result-Code }

> \[ Experimental-Result \]

{ Origin-Host }

{ Origin-Realm }

{ Auth-Application-Id }

{ CC-Request-Type }

{ CC-Request-Number }

~~\[ User-Name \]~~

\[ CC-Session-Failover \]

~~\[ CC-Sub-Session-Id \]~~

6.5 Other procedural description of the 3GPP charging applications
------------------------------------------------------------------

### 6.5.1 Re-Authorization

#### 6.5.1.1 Idle timeout

The server may specify an idle timeout associated with a granted quota
using the Quota-Holding-Time AVP.\
If no traffic associated with the quota is observed for this time, the
client shall understand that the traffic has stopped and the quota is
returned to the server. The client shall start the quota holding timer
when quota consumption ceases. This is always when traffic ceases, i.e.
the timer is re-started at the end of each packet. It applies equally to
the granted time quota and to the granted volume quota. The timer is
stopped on sending a CCR and re-initialised on receiving a CCA with the
previous used value or a new value of Quota-Holding-Time AVP if
received.

Alternatively, if this AVP is not present, a locally configurable
default value in the client shall be used.\
A Quota-Holding-Time AVP value of zero indicates that this mechanism
shall not be used.

#### 6.5.1.2 Change of charging conditions

There are a number of mid-session service events (re-authorization
triggers), which could affect the rating of the current service usage,
e.g. end user QoS changes or location updates. When allocating
resources, the server may instruct the Credit-Control client to
re-authorize the quota upon a number of different session related
triggers that can affect the rating conditions. The server instruct the
Network Element to monitor for such events by using the Trigger AVP
containing one or more Trigger-Type AVPs in the CCA command. These
events are in addition to the static triggers defined in the service
specific document (middle tier TS).

Once the OCS has armed one or more triggers using the Trigger AVP at the
Network Element, these triggers shall remain in effect until another
Trigger AVP is received for the same Rating Group, where the Network
Element shall arm all triggers present in the Trigger AVP and reset all
other triggers. The presence of the Trigger AVP without any Trigger-Type
AVPs in a CCA allows OCS to disable all the triggers that were armed in
a previous Trigger AVP.

NOTE: This removes the need for the OCS to send trigger information in
every CCA message when they have not changed.

When one of the armed triggers happen, a credit re-authorization shall
be sent to the server including information related to the service event
even if all the granted service units have not been used. The quota is
also being reported.

For example, if the Trigger AVP is used, then the client shall only
re-authorize the quota for the service usage associated with events
which were included in the last received Trigger AVP.

If the server does not control the events for re-authorization using the
Trigger AVP, the Network Element shall only monitor for default events
defined in the relevant service specific document (middle tier TS).

#### 6.5.1.3 Reporting quota usage

The Credit-Control client shall report the quota usage under a number of
circumstances. When this happens, the reason for the quota being
reported is notified to the server through the use of the
Reporting-Reason AVP in the CCR. The reason for reporting credit usage
can occur directly in the Multiple-Services-Credit-Control AVP, or in
the Used-Service-Units AVP, depending on whether it applies for all
quota types or a particular quota type respectively. It shall not be
used at command level. It shall always and shall only be sent when usage
is being reported.

When the reason is RATING\_CONDITION\_CHANGE, the Trigger AVP shall also
be included to indicate the specific armed trigger events which caused
the reporting and re-authorization request.

#### 6.5.1.4 Quota consumption

The consumption of quota is captured using mechanisms described in
clause 6.5.1.3.

Volume quota is considered used or consumed in the normal way,
corresponding to actual traffic.

The consumption of time quota may be controlled by
Quota-Consumption-Time as described in clause 6.5.4, or by extended
mechanisms as described in clause 6.5.7.

### 6.5.2 Threshold based Re-Authorization triggers

The server may optionally include as part of the
Multiple-Services-Credit-Control AVP, when it is providing a quota, an
indication to the client of the remaining quota threshold that shall
trigger a quota re-authorization.\
The Time-Quota-Threshold AVP indicates the threshold in seconds when the
granted quota is time, and the Volume-Quota-Threshold AVP indicates the
threshold in octets when the granted quota is volume.\
The Unit-Quota-Threshold AVP indicates the threshold in service specific
units, that are defined in the service specific documents, when the
granted quota is service specific.

If the threshold triggers were included along with the quota granted,
the Credit-Control client, then, shall seek re-authorization from the
server for the quota when the quota contents fall below the supplied
threshold. The client shall allow service to continue whilst the
re-authorization is progress, until the original quota had been
consumed.

### 6.5.3 Termination action

The termination action is sent over the Ro reference point. Two
different approaches are specified:

\- The Final-Unit-Indication AVP with Final-Unit-Action TERMINATE does
not include any other information. When the user has consumed the final
granted units or zero quota has been granted by the OCS, the Network
Element shall terminate the service. This is the default handling
applicable whenever the client receives an unsupported Final-Unit-Action
value. The Network Element shall send CCR message with CC-Request-Type
AVP set to the value UPDATE\_REQUEST and report the Used-Service-Unit
AVP for the service that has terminated, as defined in RFC 4006 \[402\].

\- Another termination action consists in re-directing packets
corresponding to a terminated service (consumption of the final granted
units or zero quota has been granted by the OCS) to an application
server. This allows the client to redirect user originated requests to a
top-up server so that network access can be re-instated. This
functionality is achieved with the server returning a \"REDIRECT\" and
redirect-to URL in the Final-Units-Action AVP of the
Multiple-Services-Credit-Control AVP. Upon receiving this result code,
the Network Element shall apply the redirection. The URL should be
categorized so that the End-User\'s ability to reach it is guaranteed.

When zero quota has been granted by the OCS, the termination action
shall be enforced at the reception of the CCA message.

### 6.5.4 Quota consumption time

The server may optionally indicate to the client that the quota
consumption shall be stopped after a period equal to the Quota
Consumption Time in which no packets are received or at session
termination, whichever is sooner. This is indicated by including the
Quota-Consumption-Time AVP in the CCA. The idle period equal to the
Quota Consumption Time is included in the reported usage. The quota is
consumed normally during gaps in traffic of duration less than or equal
to the Quota-Consumption-Time. Quota consumption resumes on receipt of a
further packet belonging to the service data flow.

If packets are allowed to flow during a CCR/CCA\[Update\] exchange, and
the Quota-Consumption-Time AVP value in the provided quota is the same
as in the previously provided quota, then the Quota-Consumption-Time
runs normally through this procedure. For example, if 5 seconds of a 10
second QCT timer have passed when a CCR\[Update\] is triggered, and the
CCA\[Update\] returns 2 seconds later, then the QCT timer will expire 3
seconds after the receipt of the CCA and the remaining unaccounted
5 seconds of usage will be recorded against the new quota even though no
packets were transmitted with the new quota.

In the case of a new quota with the Quota-Consumption-Time AVP, or when
packets are blocked during the CCR/CCA \[Update\] procedure then the
Quota-Consumption-Time stops running (if it was running) and quota
consumption begins again when the next service data flow packet matching
the Charging Rule is received.

If a Quota-Consumption-Time AVP value of zero is provided, or if no
Quota-Consumption-Time AVP is present in the CCA, the quota is consumed
continuously from the point at which it is granted.

### 6.5.5 Service termination

The OCF may determine that a service requires termination. The OCF may
perform this termination synchronously if it has a CCR pending
processing by returning CCA with Result-Code AVP with value
DIAMETER-AUTHORIZATION-REJECTED. If the OCF does not have a pending
request (asynchronous), the OCF may trigger an ASR to terminate the
Diameter session related to the service. On reception of an ASR, the CTF
shall close the associated Credit-Control session by sending a CCR
\[Terminate\]. The behaviour of the CTF, in relation to the user
session, on reception of an ASR is detailed in the middle-tier TS. As an
alternative to the ASR, the OCF may trigger a RAR to which the CTF
behaves as described in RFC 4006 \[402\] and the OCF shall return a CCA
with Result-Code AVP with value DIAMETER-AUTHORIZATION-REJECTED for the
resulting CCR.

### 6.5.6 Envelope reporting

#### 6.5.6.1 Envelope reporting in Online Charging

The OCF may determine the need for additional detailed reports
identifying start time and end times of specific activity in addition to
the standard quota management provided in RFC 4006 \[402\]. The OCF
controls this by sending a CCA\[INITIAL\] with Envelope-Reporting AVP.
The OCF may request reports for just time, time and volume, time and
number of events, or time and volume and number of events, through
appropriate values in Envelope-Reporting AVP.

The time envelope of the activity to be reported is determined by the
mechanism indicated by the OCF in this CCA\[INITIAL\], to control the
time quota consumption in the CTF.

The selected mechanism is used by the CTF to generate the envelopes,
reporting the start and end of each time envelope, and the data volume
transferred and / or the number of events that occurred for the duration
of the envelope

NOTE: Envelope reporting is independent of quota management (i.e. there
is no interaction).

#### 6.5.6.2 Envelope reporting in Offline Charging 

When a particular time quota consumption mechanism is selected by the
OCF, the need for reporting detailed time envelopes in offline charging,
may be statically configured in the CTF or dynamically controlled by the
OCF using Offline-Charging AVP.

The selected time quota consumption mechanism is used by the CTF to
generate the envelopes, reporting the start and end of each time
envelope, and the data volume transferred and / or the number of events
that occurred for the duration of the envelope.

#### 6.5.6.3 Envelope reporting - Quota consumption time

In case the time quota consumption mechanism selected by the OCF is per
clause 6.5.4, and the OCF indicated the need for envelope reporting,.the
CTF, on receiving the command, monitors the traffic for a period of time
controlled by the Quota-Consumption-Time AVP and reports each period as
a single envelope for each Quota-Consumption-Time expiry where there was
traffic, in Envelope AVP.

#### 6.5.6.4 Envelope reporting - Combinational quota

In case the time quota consumption mechanism selected by the OCF is per
clause 6.5.7, and the OCF indicated the need for envelope reporting, the
CTF, on receiving the command, monitors the traffic based on information
included in Time-Quota-Mechanism AVP, and reports each corresponding
envelope in the Envelope AVP in the CCR.

In case of Continuous Time Period (CTP):

\- the first envelope starts on the first traffic, and subsequent
envelopes start on the first traffic following the closure of the
previous envelope.

\- each envelope ends at expiry of the first base time interval which
contains no traffic.

The envelope for CTP includes the last base time interval, i.e. the one
which contained no traffic. The end of an envelope can only be
determined \"retrospectively\".

In case of Discrete Time Period (DTP), an envelope corresponds to
exactly one base time interval.

### 6.5.7 Combinational quota

The Quota-Consumption-Time mechanism, described in clause 6.5.4, may be
extended (and replaced) when granting time based quota to provide
potentially more efficient use of the online charging interface, i.e.
reduced traffic and the algorithms in the OCF are potentially simpler.
The alternative handling mechanisms that are defined in this clause are:

1\. Continuous Time Period (CTP)

2\. Discrete Time Period (DTP)

The mechanisms selected by the OCF is indicated to the CTF with the
Time-Quota-Mechanism AVP in the CCA.

The base time interval, specified by the Base-Time-Interval AVP, is a
basic unit for consuming quota. Quota is deemed to be consumed at the
start of each base time interval. The CTF shall allow traffic to pass
for the duration of the base time interval.

For DTP, the base time interval defines the length of the discrete time
period. Quota consumption resumes only on the first traffic following
the expiry of the DTP.

For CTP, quota consumption continues during consecutive base time
intervals in which traffic has occurred up to and including the first
base time interval which contains no traffic. Quota consumption shall be
stopped after this first base time interval expiry which contained no
traffic. Quota consumption resumes only on the first subsequent traffic.

If the CTF receives a Multiple-Services-Credit-Control AVP with both the
Quota-Consumption-Time AVP and Time-Quota-Mechanism AVP, then the
Time-Quota-Mechanism AVP takes precedence and the CTF shall behave
accordingly.

### 6.5.8 Online control of offline charging information

The Offline-Charging AVP is used on the Ro interface by the OCS to
control the CTF in relation to the mechanism by which the CTF generates
offline charging information, e.g. for flow based charging controls the
formation of service data containers. The information contained, within
the Offline-Charging AVP, takes precedence over the default
configuration at the CTF. If the Offline-Charging AVP is not sent in the
CCA, the OCS does not control the offline charging mechanisms and
therefore the default configuration at the CTF is employed.

Controls over time usage, defined in clause 6.5.6 and clause 6.5.7, are
included.

### 6.5.9 Support of multiple service 

The support of multiple services within a single Diameter session in
3GPP is limited to services that are grouped in one of the middle tier
TSs specified through the *Service-Context-Id* AVP.

### 6.5.10 Supported Features mechanism

#### 6.5.10.1 Introduction

Supported Features mechanism is used for 3GPP Charging Applications as
specified in TS 29.229 \[204\] clause 7.2, based on the
Supported-Features AVP.

#### 6.5.10.2 Defining a feature

The concept of feature used by the Supported Features mechanism, applies
under a specific domain / subsystem / service, and is defined as an
extension of the base offline and online charging functionality
specified in the corresponding middle tier.

For each middle tier, the base functionality is the one specified by the
3GPP Rel-14 version, and for any extension introduced from Rel-15, the
Supported Features mechanism is required.

For any middle tier created from Rel-15, the Supported Features
mechanism is required to be introduced.

Applicability of a feature is defined separately between offline (Rf)
and online(Ro) charging.

Any feature specified for offline and online charging, when invoked by
the client, is defined as mandatory to be supported by the server.

As specified in TS 29.229 \[204\] clause 7.1.1, if new AVPs are added as
part of the feature definition, they shall have the \'M\' bit cleared
and shall not be defined mandatory in the command ABNF.

#### 6.5.10.3 Supported Feature handling

Any request initiated by the client which makes use of a feature to
construct the request, and requires the feature to be supported by the
server, shall include the feature associated to the service-context in
the Supported-Features AVP.

The client shall include in the request feature(s) and only feature(s)
which are needed to construct the request.

In case multiple features are needed to construct the request, they
shall all be included by the client.

As defined in TS 29.229 \[204\], the Supported-Features AVP is of type
grouped and contains the Vendor-Id, Feature-List-ID and Feature-List
AVPs.

The value 10415 (3GPP) is used as Vendor-Id, and the Feature-List-ID and
Feature-List are defined per middle tier TS.

Upon receiving any initial Ro or Rf request for a specific domain /
subsystem / service, which does not include any Supported-Features AVP,
the server shall include in the answer, if supported, Supported-Features
AVPs identifying the complete set of features supported by the server
for this domain / subsystem / service. This applies regardless of the
answer is successful or not.

Upon receiving any initial Ro or Rf request for a specific domain /
subsystem / service, which includes the Supported-Features AVP, the
server shall behave as follows:

\- If all features indicated in the Supported-Features AVP are
supported, and the process for online or offline charging is successful,
a successful answer with the Result-Code AVP set to DIAMETER\_SUCCESS is
returned and includes, if supported, Supported-Features AVPs identifying
the complete set of features supported by the server for this domain /
subsystem / service.

\- If not all the features indicated in the Supported-Features AVP are
supported, the answer is returned with Experimental-Result-Code AVP set
to DIAMETER\_ERROR\_FEATURE\_UNSUPPORTED and includes the
Supported-Features AVPs containing lists of all features supported by
the server.

\- If Supported-Features AVP is not supported by the server, the answer
is returned, as per \'M\' bit set rule, with the Result-Code AVP set to
DIAMETER\_AVP\_UNSUPPORTED and a Failed-AVP AVP containing at least one
Supported-Features AVP as received in the request.

During the lifetime of the Diameter session, the client shall use the
set of features which are common between its own set of supported
features and the set of supported features indicated by the server
during the Diameter session establishment, in session based charging.

For secure transport of Diameter messages used for offline and online
charging application, see 3GPP TS 33.210 \[246\].

7 Summary of used Attribute Value Pairs
=======================================

7.1 Diameter AVPs
-----------------

### 7.1.0 General

The use of the Attribute Value Pairs (AVPs) that are defined in the
Diameter Protocol is specified in clause 6.2 for offline charging and in
clause 6.4 for online charging. The information is summarized in the
table 7.1.0.1 in alphabetical order. Detailed specification of some of
these AVPs is available after the table and for the others can be found
from RFC 6733 \[401\], RFC 4006 \[402\] and RFC 4005 \[407\].

Those Diameter AVPs that are used are marked \"M\", \"O~M~\" or \"Oc\"
in the following table.\
This implies that their content can be used by the CDF for offline and
by the OCF for online charging purposes.\
Those Diameter AVPs that are not used are marked \"-\" in table 7.1.0.1.

Name (APN) the user is connected to.

### 7.1.8 Event-Timestamp AVP

The *Event-Timestamp* AVP (AVP code 55) shall contain the time when the
chargeable event is received in the CTF.

### 7.1.8A Experimental-Result AVP

The *Experimental-Result* AVP (AVP code 297) defined in RFC 6733
\[401\], shall contain the values used in offline and online charging
applications. The Vendor-ID AVP shall contain 3GPP (10415), and
following values are used for Experimental-Result-Code:

**Permanent Failures (5xxx):**

5011 DIAMETER\_ERROR\_FEATURE\_UNSUPPORTED

> At least one feature included in the request sent by the CTF is not
> supported by the CDF or OCF. This value is defined in TS 29.229
> \[204\]

### 7.1.9 Multiple-Services-Credit-Control AVP

The *Multiple-Services-Credit-Control* AVP (AVP code 456) is of type
grouped as specified in RFC 4006 \[402\]. It contains additional 3GPP
specific charging parameters.

It has the following ABNF grammar:

\<Multiple-Services-Credit-Control\> ::= \< AVP Header: 456 \>

### 7.1.10 Rating-Group AVP

The *Rating-Group* AVP (AVP code 432), is defined in RFC 4006 \[402\].
It contains the charging key (defined in TS 23.203 \[218\]). Each quota
allocated to a Diameter CC session has a unique Rating Group value as
specified in RFC 4006 \[402\].

### 7.1.11 Result-Code AVP

This subclause defines new *Result-Code* AVP (AVP code 268) values that
shall be supported by all Diameter implementations that conform to the
present document. The Result-Code AVP operates as described in RFC 6733
\[401\] and RFC 4006 \[402\]. The following result code descriptions are
examples of the possible uses for the code:

**Transient Failures (4xxx):**

4010 DIAMETER\_END\_USER\_SERVICE\_DENIED

> The OCF denies the service request due to service restrictions (e.g.
> terminate rating group) or limitations related to the end-user, for
> example the end-user\'s account could not cover the requested service.

4011 DIAMETER\_CREDIT\_CONTROL\_NOT\_APPLICABLE

> The OCF determines that the service can be granted to the end user but
> no further Credit-Control\
> needed for the service (e.g. service is free of charge or is treated
> for offline charging).

4012 DIAMETER\_CREDIT\_LIMIT\_REACHED

> The OCF denies the service request since the end- user\'s account
> could not cover the requested service. If the CCR contained
> used-service-units they are deducted, if possible.

**Permanent Failures (5xxx):**

5003 DIAMETER\_AUTHORIZATION\_REJECTED

> The OCF denies the service request in order to terminate the service
> for which credit is requested. For example this error code is used to
> inform IP CAN bearer has to be terminated in the CCR message or to
> inform blacklist the rating group in the
> Multiple-Service-Credit-Control AVP.

5030 DIAMETER\_USER\_UNKNOWN

The specified end user could not be found in the OCF.

5031 DIAMETER\_RATING\_FAILED

> This error code is used to inform the CTF that the OCF cannot rate the
> service request due to insufficient rating input, incorrect AVP
> combination or due to an AVP or an AVP value that is not recognized or
> supported in the rating. For Flow Based Charging this error code is
> used if the Rating group is not recognized. The Failed-AVP AVP MUST be
> included and contain a copy of the entire AVP(s) that could not be
> processed successfully or an example of the missing AVP complete with
> the Vendor-Id if applicable. The value field of the missing AVP should
> be of correct minimum length and contain zeroes.

### 7.1.12 Service-Context-Id AVP

The *Service-Context-Id* AVP is defined in RFC 4006 \[402\]. It is of
type UTF8String and contains a unique identifier of the Diameter
Credit-Control service specific document that applies to the request.\
This is an identifier allocated by the service provider/operator, by the
service element manufacturer or by a standardization body and MUST
uniquely identify a given Diameter Credit-Control service specific
document. For offline charging, this identifies the service specific
document (\'middle tier\' TS) on which associated CDRs should based. The
format of the Service-Context-Id is:

\"extensions\".MNC.MCC.\"Release\".\"service-context\" \"@\" \"domain\"

The 3GPP specific values for \"service-context\" \"@\" \"domain\" are:

32251\@3gpp.org for PS charging

32253\@3gpp.org for CPDT charging

<32254@3gpp.org> for Exposure function API charging

32260\@3gpp.org for IMS charging

32270\@3gpp.org for MMS service charging

32271\@3gpp.org for LCS service charging

32272\@3gpp.org for PoC service charging

32273\@3gpp.org for MBMS service charging

32274\@3gpp.org for SMS service charging

<32275@3gpp.org> for MMTel service charging

32276\@3gpp.org for VCS charging

<32277@3gpp.org> for ProSe charging

32278\@3gpp.org for Monitoring Event charging

32280\@3gpp.org for AoC Service Information

32296\@3gpp.org for ABMF Rc information

The \"Release\" indicates the 3GPP Release the service specific document
is based upon e.g. 12 for Release 12.

As a minimum, \"Release\".\"service-context\" \"@\" \"domain\" shall be
used. If the minimum is used all operator provisionable parameters (Oc
and Om) are optional.

The MNC.MCC identifies the operator implementing the service specific
document, which is used to determine the specific requirements for the
operator configurable parameters.

The \"extensions\" is operator specific information to any extensions in
a service specific document.

### 7.1.13 Service-Identifier AVP

The *Service-Identifier* AVP (AVP code 439), is defined in RFC 4006
\[402\]. For further details, please refer the middle-tier
specification.

### 7.1.14 Used-Service-Unit AVP

The *Used-Service-Unit* AVP (AVP code 446) is of type grouped as
specified in RFC 4006 \[402\]. It contains additional 3GPP specific
charging parameters.

It has the following ABNF grammar:

\<Used-Service-Unit\> ::= \< AVP Header: 446 \>

> \[ Reporting-Reason \]
>
> \[ Tariff-Change-Usage \]
>
> \[ CC-Time \]
>
> ~~\[ CC-Money \]~~
>
> \[ CC-Total-Octets \]

\[ CC-Input-Octets \]

\[ CC-Output-Octets \]

\[ CC-Service-Specific-Units \]

\*\[ Event-Charging-TimeStamp \]

~~\*\[ AVP \]~~

### 7.1.15 User-Name AVP

The *User-Name* AVP (AVP code 1) contains the user name in the format of
a NAI according to RFC 6733 \[401\].

### 7.1.16 Vendor-Id AVP

The *Vendor-Id* AVP (AVP code 266), as part of the grouped
*Vendor-Specific-Application-Id* AVP, shall contain the value of 10415,
which is the IANA registered value for \'3GPP\' in TS 29.230 \[206\].

### 7.1.17 User-Equipment-Info AVP

The *User-Equipment-Info*  AVP (AVP code 458) is of type grouped and
contains the identity and capability of the terminal the subscriber is
using for the connection to network according to IETF RFC 4006 \[402\]
with the following ABNF grammar:

User-Equipment-Info ::= \< AVP Header: 458 \>

{ User-Equipment-Info-Type }

{ User-Equipment-Info-Value }

For PS charging, when the User-Equipment-Info-Type AVP (AVP code 459) is
set to IMEISV (0), the value within the User-Equipment-Info-Value AVP
(AVP code 460) is of type OctetString and shall be a UTF-8 encoded
hexadecimal. The composition of the IMEISV follows the definition in TS
23.003 \[224\] . If only IMEI is received a filler 'F' is used to make
it 16 digits.

For IMS charging, when the User-Equipment-Info-Type AVP (AVP code 459)
is set to IMEISV (0), the value within the User-Equipment-Info-Value AVP
(AVP code 460) is of type OctetString and shall be a UTF-8 encoded
decimal. The composition of the IMEISV follows the definition in TS
23.003 \[224\]. If only IMEI is received the number of digits are
truncated to 15.

7.2 3GPP specific AVPs
----------------------

### 7.2.0 General

For the purpose of offline charging additional AVPs are used in ACR /
ACA and for online charging additional AVPs are used in CCR / CCA. All
3GPP specific AVPs mentioned are relevant for both offline and online
charging unless specifically excluded. The information is summarized in
the following table 7.2.0.1 along with the AVP flag rules.

The 3GPP Charging Application uses the value 10415 (3GPP) as
*Vendor-Id.*

Detailed descriptions of AVPs that are used specifically for 3GPP
charging are provided in the subclauses below the table. However, for
AVPs that are just borrowed from other applications only the reference
(e.g. TS 29.229 \[204\]), is provided in the following table and the
detailed description is not repeated.

Where 3GPP RADIUS VSAs are re-used, they shall be translated to Diameter
AVPs as described in RFC 4005 \[407\] with the exception that the \'M\'
flag shall be set.

Error \"DIAMETER\_TOO\_BUSY\", in the Result\_Code AVP of the answer to
a related request, as a mean for overload control. This is further
enhanced using generic DOIC (Diameter Overload Indication Conveyance)
mechanism specified in IETF RFC 7683 \[403\], which makes it possible
for a server to indicate overload situations to the clients before the
server starts rejecting requests due to overload and thus prevents
retransmission of the requests.

This clause specifies the DOIC (Diameter Overload Indication Conveyance)
mechanism for Diameter charging applications.

B.1.1 Reporting node
--------------------

When the OCS needs to request a reduction in the traffic it is handling
due to an overload condition, it shall include the OC-OLR AVP in answer
messages, as defined in clause B.3. The OCS should include the OC-OLR
AVP in the answer messages for as long as the overload condition
applies. This shall be based on the OC-Supported-Features AVP, defined
in clause B3, exchanged earlier.

How OCS determines that it is in an overload situation and the severity
of the overload is implementation dependent and based on operator
policy.

B.1.2 Reacting node
-------------------

A CTF acting as a reacting node reports its supported overload
capabilities in the OC-Supported-Features AVP and applies the requested
traffic reduction received in OC-OLR AVPs in answer messages to
corresponding applicable requests, as per IETF RFC 7683 \[33\].

How it achieves the requested traffic reduction is implementation
dependent.

B.2 Diameter overload AVPs
==========================

B.2.0 General
-------------

When the OCS determines the need to request a reduction in the traffic
it is handling due to an overload condition, it shall include the OC-OLR
AVP in answer messages, as defined in IETF RFC 7683 \[403\].

B.2.1 3GPP-OC-Rating-Group AVP
------------------------------

The *OC-Rating-Group* AVP (AVP code 1321), is of type Unsigned32. It
contains the charging key (defined in TS 23.203 \[218\]) that the
overload control is applied to, i.e. which Rating Groups should be
restricted.

B.2.2 3GPP-OC-Request-Type AVP
------------------------------

The *OC-Request-Type* AVP (AVP code 1322), is of type Enumerated. It
contains the CC-Request-Type (defined in IETF RFC 4006 \[402\]) that the
overload control be applied to, i.e. which types of request that should
be restricted. It has the following values:

1 INITIAL\_REQUEST

2 UPDATE\_REQUEST

3 TERMINATION\_REQUEST

4 EVENT\_REQUEST

B.2.3 3GPP-OC-Specific-Reduction AVP
------------------------------------

The *3GPP-OC-Specific-Reduction* AVP (AVP code 1320) is of type Grouped.
It details the for which Rating Group, type of requests or both the
reduction, due to overload, should be applied.

It has the following ABNF grammar:

> 3GPP-OC-Specific-Reduction :: = \< AVP Header: 1320 \>
>
> \* \[ 3GPP-OC-Rating-Group \]
>
> \* \[ 3GPP-OC-Request-Type \]
>
> \[ OC-Reduction-Percentage \]
>
> \* \[ AVP \]

B.2.4 OC-OLR AVP
----------------

The *OC-OLR* AVP (AVP code 623) is of type Grouped. It has been extended
compared to the IETF RFC 7683 \[403\].

It has the following ABNF grammar:

> OC-OLR :: = \< AVP Header: 623 \>
>
> \< OC-Sequence-Number \>
>
> \< OC-Report-Type \>
>
> \[ OC-Reduction-Percentage \]
>
> \[ OC-Validity-Duration \]
>
> \* \[ 3GPP-OC-Specific-Reduction \]
>
> \* \[ AVP \]
