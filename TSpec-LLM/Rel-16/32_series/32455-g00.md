######## Annex A (informative): Use case for KPIs

A.1 Use case for EPS attach success rate related KPI
----------------------------------------------------

It is necessary to evaluate accessibility performance provided by EPS.
EPS attachment for a UE/user is important when they access network. If
users or subscribers cannot attach to the PS network of EPS, they cannot
access EPS. This KPI is focusing on network and user view.

A.2 Use case for inter-RAT handover related KPIs
------------------------------------------------

Inter RAT handover success rate is used to evaluate stability and
reliability performance of handover between EPS and GSM or UMTS or
CDMA2000. If the KPI value is too low, call drop rate may be increased.
This KPI is focusing on network and user view.

A.3 Use case for mean active dedicated EPS bearer utilization related KPI
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mean active dedicated EPS bearer utilization can be used to indicate
system load level. If the value of this KPI is very high, it indicates
system capacity is not enough, and needs to be increased. So it is an
important indicator for EPC network optimization.

This KPI is focusing on network view.

A.4 Use case for dedicated EPS bearer creation success rate related KPI
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

If PGW can not create the dedicated bearer, then users cannot use the
services provided by EPS successfully, which will influence the users'
satisfactory to the network. So it is necessary to define dedicated EPS
bearer creation success rate to evaluate accessibility performance
provided by EPS and network performance, user behaviour is included.

This KPI is focusing on network and user view.

A.5 Use case for mean dedicated bearer set-up time by MME related KPI
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Mean dedicated bearer set-up time by MME can be used to describe the
duration between a UE requests a service and the service is successfully
established, it can reflect the user satisfactory of high data rate
service and network performance of dedicated bearer set-up. So it is
useful to evaluate accessibility performance provided by EPS and network
performance.

This KPI is focusing on network and user view.

A.6 Use case for service request success rate related KPI
---------------------------------------------------------

Service Request procedure is one of the important NAS procedures which
is triggered by the UE when it is in idle state and has some data to
send or receive (after the paging procedure). If the service request
success rate is lower than predefined threshold, the user experience of
sending / receiving the data will be affected. So it is necessary to
define service request success rate, the user behaviour is included.

This KPI is focusing on network and user view.

A.7 Use case for tracking area update success rate related KPI
--------------------------------------------------------------

Tracking area update success rate is useful to evaluate mobility
provided by EPS. If a user fails to update the tracking area, the user
may not be paged by network because the target tracking area can not be
attached. If the tracking area update success rate is lower than a
predefined threshold, the tracking areas maybe need to be re-planed. So
it is necessary to define the tracking area update success rate, the
user behaviour is included.

This KPI is focusing on network and user view.
