1 Scope
=======

The present document is part of a series of Technical Specifications
(TSs) that specify charging functionality and charging management in
GSM/UMTS networks. The GSM/UMTS core network charging architecture and
principles are specified in document TS 32.240 \[1\], which provides an
umbrella for other charging management documents that specify:

\- the content of the CDRs per domain and subsystem (offline charging);

\- the content of real-time charging messages per domain / subsystem
(online charging);

\- the functionality of online and offline charging for those domains
and subsystems;

\- the interfaces that are used in the charging framework to transfer
the charging information (i.e. CDRs or charging events).

The complete document structure for these TSs is defined in TS 32.240
\[1\].

The present document specifies the offline and online charging
description for MMS charging, based on the functional stage 2
descriptions of the MMS in TS 23.140 \[201\]. This charging description
includes the offline and online charging architecture and scenarios
specific to the MMS, as well as the mapping of the common 3GPP charging
architecture specified in TS 32.240 \[1\] onto MMS. It further specifies
the structure and content of the CDRs for offline charging, and the
charging events for online charging. The present document is related to
other 3GPP charging TSs as follows:

\- The common 3GPP charging architecture is specified in TS 32.240
\[1\];

\- The parameters, abstract syntax and encoding rules for these CDR
types are specified in TS 32.298 \[51\].

\- A transaction based mechanism for the transfer of CDRs within the
network is specified in TS 32.295 \[54\].

\- The file based mechanism used to transfer the CDRs from the network
to the operator\'s billing domain (e.g. the billing system or a
mediation device) is specified in TS 32.297 \[52\].

\- The 3GPP Diameter application that is used for MMS online charging is
specified in TS 32.299 \[50\].

All terms, definitions and abbreviations used in the present document,
that are common across 3GPP TSs, are defined in the 3GPP Vocabulary, TR
21.905 \[100\]. Those that are common across charging management in
GSM/UMTS domains, services or subsystems are provided in the umbrella
document TS 32.240 \[1\] and are copied into clause 3 of the present
document for ease of reading. Finally, those items that are specific to
the present document are defined exclusively in the present document.

Furthermore, requirements that govern the charging work are specified in
TS 22.115 \[101\].

3 Definitions, symbols and abbreviations
========================================

3.1 Definitions
---------------

For the purposes of the present document, the following terms and
definitions given in TR 21.905 \[50\], TS 32.240 \[1\] and TS 22.140
\[200\] and the following apply:

**accounting:** process of apportioning charges between the Home
Environment, Serving Network and subscriber.

**application data:** Information / data specific to an application
other than the MMS User Agent / VASP which is intended to be transported
without alteration by using MMS. Application Data may be of any content
type and format.

**billing:** function whereby CDRs generated by the charging function(s)
are transformed into bills requiring payment.

**Billing Domain:** part of the operator network, which is outside the
telecommunications network, that receives and processes CDR files from
the network charging functions. It includes functions that can provide
billing mediation and billing or other (e.g. statistical) end
applications. It is only applicable to offline charging (see \"Online
Charging System\" for equivalent functionality in online charging).

**chargeable event:** activity utilizing telecommunications network
resources and related services for:

\- user to user communication (e.g. a single call, a data communication
session or a short message); or

\- user to network communication (e.g. service profile administration);
or

\- inter-network communication (e.g. transferring calls, signalling, or
short messages); or

\- mobility (e.g. roaming or inter-system handover); and

\- that the network operator may want to charge for.

As a minimum, a chargeable event characterises the resource / service
usage and indicates the identity of the involved end user(s).

**charged party:** user involved in a chargeable event who has to pay
parts or the whole charges of the chargeable event, or a third party
paying the charges caused by one or all users involved in the chargeable
event, or a network operator.

**charging:** a function within the telecommunications network and the
associated OCS/BD components whereby information related to a chargeable
event is collected, formatted, transferred and evaluated in order to
make it possible to determine usage for which the charged party may be
billed.

**Charging Data Record (CDR):** a formatted collection of information
about a chargeable event (e.g. time of call set-up, duration of the
call, amount of data transferred, etc) for use in billing and
accounting. For each party to be charged for parts of or all charges of
a chargeable event a separate CDR shall be generated, i.e. more than one
CDR may be generated for a single chargeable event, e.g. because of its
long duration, or because more than one charged party is to be charged.

**charging event: a set of charging information forwarded by the CTF
towards the CDF (offline charging) or towards the OCS (online charging).
Each charging event matches exactly one chargeable event.**

**charging function:** entity inside the network domain, subsystem or
service that is involved in charging for that domain, subsystem or
service.

**circuit switched domain:** domain within GSM / UMTS in which
information is transferred in circuit switched mode.

**Credit-Control:** mechanism which directly interacts in real-time with
an account and controls or monitors the charges, related to the service
usage. Credit-Control is a process of: checking if credit is available,
credit reservation, deduction of credit from the end user account when
service is completed and refunding of reserved credit not used.

**delivery report:** feedback information provided to an originator MMS
User Agent by an MMS Relay/Server about the status of the delivery of an
MM.

**domain:** part of a communication network that provides network
resources using a certain bearer technology.

**forwarded MM:** MM originally sent from a sender to an intended
recipient which is then forwarded to other recipient(s) and to which a
delivery report and/or read-reply report may refer and which may be
subject to further forwarding.

**forwarding MMS User Agent**: MMS User Agent that is the intended
recipient of an MM and that requests forwarding of the MM for delivery
to other recipient(s) without having to first download the MM.

**Fully Qualified Partial CDR (FQPC):** partial CDR that contains a
complete set of the fields specified in the present document. This
includes all the mandatory and conditional fields as well as those
fields that the PLMN operator has provisioned to be included in the CDR.
The first Partial CDR shall be a Fully qualified Partial CDR.

**message ID:** unique identifier for an MM.

**middle tier TS: used for the 3GPP charging TSs that specify the domain
/ subsystem / service specific, online and offline, charging
functionality. These are all the TSs in the numbering range from TS
32.250 \[10\] to TS 32.27x \[3x\], e.g. TS 32.250 \[10\] for the CS
domain, or TS 32.270 \[30\] for the MMS service. Currently, there is
only one \"tier 1\" TS in 3GPP, which is TS 32.240 \[1\] that specifies
the charging architecture and principles. Finally, there are a number of
top tier TSs in the 32.29x numbering range (\[50\] ff) that specify
common charging aspects such as parameter definitions, encoding rules,
the common Billing Domain interface or common charging applications.**

**MMSE:** collection of MMS-specific elements under the control of a
single administration.

**MMS Relay/Server (MMS R/S):** MMS-specific network entity/application
that is under the control of an MMS service provider.\
An MMS relay/server transfers messages, provides operations of the MMS
that are specific to or required by the mobile environment and provides
(temporary and/or persistent) storage services to the MMS.

**MMS User Agent:** application residing on a user equipment, a mobile
station or an external device that performs MMS-specific operations on a
user\'s behalf and/or on another application\'s behalf. An MMS User
Agent is not considered part of an MMSE.

**near real-time:** near real-time charging and billing information is
to be generated, processed, and transported to a desired conclusion in
less than one (1) minute.

**offline charging:** charging mechanism where charging information
**does not** affect, in real-time, the service rendered.

**online charging:** charging mechanism where charging information can
affect, in real-time, the service rendered and therefore a direct
interaction of the charging mechanism with bearer/session/service
control is required.

**Online Charging System:** the entity that performs real-time
Credit-Control. Its functionality includes transaction handling, rating,
online correlation and management of subscriber accounts/balances.

**original MM:** (initial) MM sent from a sender to a recipient and to
which a delivery report and/or a read-reply report and/or a reply-MM may
refer and/or which may be subject to being forwarded.

**originator MMS User Agent: a**n MMS User Agent associated with the
sender of an MM.

**packet switched domain:** domain within GSM / UMTS in which data is
transferred in packet switched mode. Corresponds to the term \"GPRS\".

**partial CDR:** CDR that provides information on part of a subscriber
session. A long session may be covered by several partial CDRs. Two
formats are considered for Partial CDRs. One that contains all of the
specified fields (FQPC); the second has a reduced format (RPC*)*.

**read-reply report:** feedback information to an originator MMS User
Agent by a Recipient MMS User Agent about the status of
handling/rendering of an original MM in a Recipient MMS User Agent.

**real-time:** real-time charging and billing information is to be
generated, processed, and transported to a desired conclusion in less
than one (1) second.

**Recipient MMS User Agent:** MMS User Agent associated with the
recipient of an MM.

**reply-MM:** in case of reply-charging the first reply accepted by the
Recipient MMS Relay/Server (after checking the reply charging
limitations, such as the latest time of submission) is called a
reply-MM.

**settlement:** payment of amounts resulting from the accounting
process.

**subscriber:** a subscriber is an entity (associated with one or more
users) that is engaged in a subscription with a service provider. The
subscriber is allowed to subscribe and unsubscribe services, to register
a user or a list of users authorized to enjoy these services, and also
to set the limits relative to the use that associated users make of
these services.

**user: a**n entity, not part of the 3GPP System, that uses **network
resources by means of a subscription. The user may or may not be
identical to the subscriber holding that subscription.**

**User Equipment (UE):** a device allowing a user access to network
services. For the purpose of 3GPP specifications the interface between
the UE and the network is the radio interface. A User Equipment can be
subdivided into a number of domains, the domains being separated by
reference points. Currently defined domains are the USIM and ME Domains.
The ME Domain can further be subdivided into several components showing
the connectivity between multiple functional groups. These groups can be
implemented in one or more hardware devices. An example of such a
connectivity is the TE -- MT interface. Further, an occurrence of a User
Equipment is an MS for GSM as defined in TS 24.002 \[202\].

As described in TS 32.240 \[1\], the CTF (an integrated component in
each charging relevant NE) generates charging events and forwards them
to the CDF. The CDF, in turn, generates CDRs which are then transferred
to the CGF.\
Finally, the CGF creates CDR files and forwards them to the Billing
Domain (BD).

In MMS, all charging functions (CTF, CDF and CGF) reside within the MMS
R/S. I.e. the MMS R/S is connected directly to the BD via the Bm
interface. Bm is the MMS specific variant of the common Bx interface and
is functionally equivalent to MM8. This architecture implies that there
exists no separate CDF and CGF for MMS, i.e. no corresponding open
interfaces between any such functions, within the 3GPP standards.

Figure 4.2.1 depicts the mapping of the 3GPP common charging
architecture, as laid down in TS 32.240 \[1\], onto the MMS.

Figure 4.2.1: MMS offline charging architecture

In addition to the standard approach depicted in figure 4.2.1, vendors
may choose to implement separate CDF and CGF for MMS. In that case, the
interfaces between these functions should comply with the definition of
the Rf and Ga interfaces (TS 32.299 \[50\] and TS 32.295 \[54\],
respectively) as much as possible.

4.3 MMS online charging architecture
------------------------------------

MMS online charging is based on MMS R/S functionality that is further
specified in the present document. For online charging, the MMS R/S
utilizes the Ro interface and application towards the OCS as specified
in TS 32.299 \[50\].\
The Ro reference point covers all online charging functionality required
for MMS, i.e. it is functionally equivalent to the MM9 reference point.

The MMS online charging architecture is depicted in figure 4.3.1.

Figure 4.3.1: MMS online charging architecture

Details on the interfaces and functions can be found in TS 32.240 \[1\]
for the general architecture components,\
TS 32.296 \[53\] for the OCS, and 32.299 \[50\] for the Ro application.

5 MMS charging principles and scenarios
=======================================

5.1 MMS charging principles
---------------------------

### 5.1.0 Introduction

The MMS R/S collects charging information for each MM transaction that
crosses the relevant reference points defined in TS 22.140 \[200\]. The
chargeable events that trigger the collection of charging information on
the applicable reference points are identical for MMS offline and online
charging and are specified below. The use of the events to generate CDRs
(offline charging) or Credit-Ccontrol requests (online charging) are
described in clause 5.2 for offline charging and in clause 5.3 for
online charging, respectively.

In line with the requirements laid down in TS 22.140 \[200\] and TS
23.140 \[201\] the MMS R/S collects charging information such as:

> \- the destination and source addresses applied for an MM;
>
> \- identification of the MMS R/S(s) involved in the MM transaction;
>
> \- the amount and type of user data transmitted in MO and MT
> directions for the transfer of MM; i.e. the size of the MM and its
> components;
>
> \- storage duration; i.e. the time interval when a MM is saved on a
> non-volatile memory media;
>
> \- identification of the bearer resources used for the transport of
> the MM; i.e. the identity of the network and the network nodes;
>
> \- in scenarios involving a VASP, the charging information describes
> the identification of the VASP and the amount of user data sent and
> received between the MMS R/S and the VASP.
>
> \- in scenarios involving the MSCF, additional information supplied by
> the MSCF.

The information listed above is captured for use cases in relation to:

> \- MM submission;
>
> \- MM retrieval;
>
> \- MM forwarding;
>
> \- transactions involving the MMbox;
>
> \- transactions involving a VASP.

Refer to TS 23.140 \[201\] for further details on the above MM
transactions.

The following scenarios can be distinguished in MMS charging:

> \- Combined Originator and Recipient MMS R/S. This scenario covers the
> case where the Originator MMS R/S and the Recipient MMS R/S are
> identical, which implies that that particular MMS R/S handles both MM
> submission and MM retrieval.
>
> \- Distributed Originator and Recipient MMS R/S. This scenario covers
> the case of the Originator MMS R/S and the Recipient MMS R/S being two
> different entities, where the Originator MMS R/S handles MM submission
> and the Recipient MMS R/S handles MM retrieval.
>
> \- MMBox management. MMBox is a logical entity of the MMS R/S that
> allow to support the persistent network-based storage of the MMs. This
> feature is an extension of the MM1 interface that enables a MMS User
> Agent to store, retrieve and delete incoming and submitted MMs.
>
> \- VASP transactions. MMS VAS Application offers value added services
> to the MMS Users. The MMS VASP are able to interact with the MMS R/S
> via the MM7 interface using transactions similar to those of the MM1
> interface i.e. submission, reception, delivery-report, read-reply
> report, etc.

These scenarios all pertain to atomic actions related to MMs, e.g.
submission, retrieval, storage, deletion, etc., implying that MMS only
uses event based charging, as specified in TS 32.240 \[1\] (i.e. session
based charging is not applicable for MMS). The following subclauses
further describe the above scenarios and illustrate the conditions for
the various types of chargeable events based on MMs crossing the
reference points identified in TS 23.140 \[201\] (MM1, MM4 and MM7). The
labels in the message flows identify the chargeable events in relation
to the particular reference point.

### 5.1.1 Combined OOriginator and Recipient MMS R/S

This scenario, as depicted in figure 5.1.1.1, covers the case where the
Originator MMS R/S and the Recipient MMS R/S are identical, which
implies that that particular MMS R/S handles both MM submission and MM
retrieval.

### 5.1.2 Distributed Originator and Recipient MMS R/S

This scenario, as depicted in figure 5.1.2.1, covers the case of the
Originator MMS R/S and the Recipient MMS R/S being two different
entities, where the Originator MMS R/S handles MM submission and the
Recipient MMS R/S handles MM retrieval.

### 5.1.3 MMBox management

MMBox is a logical entity of the MMS R/S that allows to support the
persistent network-based storage of the MMs.\
This feature is an extension of the MM1 interface that enables the MMS
User Agent to store, retrieve and delete incoming and submitted MMs. For
further detailed description of \"Persistent Network-Based Storage\" see
TS 23.140 \[201\].

This scenario, as depicted in figure 5.1.3.1, covers the MM transactions
related to MMBox usage and the associated chargeable events in the
affected MMS R/S.

### 5.1.4 VASP transactions

MMS VAS Application offers value added services to the MMS Users. The
MMS VASP are able to interact with the MMS R/S via the MM7 reference
point using transactions similar to those of the MM1 interface i.e.
submission, reception, delivery-report, read-reply report, etc.

The VASP may provide service codes that contain billing information
which may be transferred to the MMS R/S and passed directly to the
billing system without intervention. In addition, the VASP may provide
an indication to the MMS R/S which party is expected to be charged for
an MM submitted by the VASP, e.g. the sending, receiving, both parties
or neither.

This scenario, as depicted in figure 5.1.4.1, covers the VASP related MM
transactions and the associated chargeable events in the affected MMS
R/S.

  the MMS R/S responding to these requests, rather than upon receiving them.                   
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------

5.2 MMS offline charging scenarios
----------------------------------

### 5.2.1 Basic principles

MMS offline charging implies the generation of CDRs of various types by
the involved MMS R/S(s). As explained in clause 5.1, only event based
charging applies to MMS, i.e. there is no use of session based charging
in the MMS R/S.\
In line with the principles for event based charging laid down in TS
32.240 \[1\], the relationship between chargeable events and charging
events is 1:1, and the relationship between charging events and CDRs is
also 1:1.

The chargeable event triggers are defined in clause 5.1.1 to 5.1.4 above
and are identified by the labels within the figures 5.1 to 5.4 (message
flows) in relation to the particular MMS reference point. As can be seen
from these figures, the chargeable events relate to transactions at the
MM1, MM4 and MM7 reference points.

An open Rf or Ga interface is not specified for MMS in the 3GPP
standards, hence no charging events (Rf message flows) are specified in
clause 5.2.2.\
In clause 5.2.3, CDR generation is described in relation to the
chargeable event triggers specified in clause 5.1, given that there is a
1:1 relation all the way from chargeable event to CDR type as explained
in the first paragraph above. However, due to the absence of a standard
Ga interface for MMS, from the 3GPP specifications perspective these
CDRs are only visible in CDR files crossing the Bm interface.

### 5.2.2 Rf message flows

Not applicable, as the separation of the CTF and CDF is not in the scope
of the MMS charging standards.\
Refer to clause 4.2 for further information.

NOTE: Vendors may nevertheless implement a separate CTF and CDF for MMS
charging.\
In this case, it is recommended that the approach chosen conforms to the
principles and protocol applications specified in TS 32.299 \[50\].

### 5.2.3 CDR generation

For MMS, the Ga interface is not applicable, as the separation of the
CDF and CGF is not in the scope of the MMS charging specifications. I.e.
the following CDR types are visible only in the CDR files transferred
from the MMS R/S embedded CGF to the BD via the Bm interface.

NOTE: If vendors choose to implement the Ga interface for MMS, then it
is recommended that the approach chosen conforms with the CDRs specified
in this section and the Ga protocol conventions laid down in\
TS 32.295 \[54\].

#### 5.2.3.1 Combined Originator and Recipient MMS R/S case

The chargeable events for the case of a combined Originator and
Recipient MMS R/S are depicted in figure 5.1.1.1 and further listed in
table 5.1.1.1. Due to the fact that only event based charging applies to
MMS (see clause 5.2.1), these chargeable events translate 1:1 into the
CDR types listed in table 5.2.3.1.1 below.

The first row in table 5.2.3.1.1 refers to the trigger labels in
figure/table 5.1.1.1.\
The second row identifies the associated CDR type. The content of these

The chargeable events for the case of distributed Originator and
Recipient MMS R/Ss are depicted in figures 5.1.2.2/3 and further listed
in table 5.1.2.1. Due to the fact that only event based charging applies
to MMS (see clause 5.2.1), these chargeable events translate 1:1 into
the CDR types listed in tables 5.2.3.2.1/2 below.

The first row in the tables refers to the trigger labels in figure/table
5.1.2. The second row identifies the associated CDR type. The content of
these CDR types is specified in clause 6.

#### 5.2.3.3 MMBox related CDRs

The chargeable events for the MMBox management are depicted in figure
5.1.3.1 and further listed in table 5.1.3.2.\
Due to the fact that only event based charging applies to MMS (see
clause 5.2.1), these chargeable events translate 1:1 into the CDR types
listed in table 5.2.3.3.1 below.

The first row in table 5.2.3.3.1 refers to the trigger labels in
figure/table 5.1.3.1.\
The second row identifies the associated CDR type. The content of these
CDR types is specified in clause 6.

#### 5.2.3.4 CDRs related to VASP transactions

The chargeable events for the VASP transactions are depicted in figure
5.1.4.1 and further listed in table 5.1.4.2.\
Due to the fact that only event based charging applies to MMS (see
clause 5.2.1), these chargeable events translate 1:1 into the CDR types
listed in table 5.2.3.4.1 below.

The first row in table 5.2.3.4.1 refers to the trigger labels in
figure/table 5.1.4.1.\

  ---------------- ------ -------- -------- ------ ------ --------- --------- -------- -------- ------- -------

### 5.2.4 Ga record transfer flows

Not applicable, as the separation of the CDF and CGF is not in the scope
of the MMS charging standards.\
Refer to clause 4.2 for further information.

NOTE: Vendors may nevertheless implement a separate CDF and CGF for MMS
charging. In this case, it is recommended that the approach chosen
conforms to the principles and protocol applications specified in TS
32.295 \[54\].

### 5.2.5 Bm CDR file transfer

The integrated CGF of the MMS R/S transfers the CDR files to the BD as
described in TS 32.297 \[52\].\
In MMS, both fully qualified partial CDRs (FQPC) and reduced partial
CDRs (RPC), as specified in TS 32.240 \[1\] may be supported on the Bm
interface. In line with TS 32.240 \[1\], the support of FQPCs is
mandatory, the support of RPCs is optional. For further details on the
Bm protocol application refer to TS 32.297 \[52\].

5.3 MMS online charging scenarios
---------------------------------

MMS online charging uses the Credit Control (CC) application as
specified in TS 32.299 \[50\].

### 5.3.1 Basic principles

MMS charging may use the Immediate Event Charging (IEC) principle or the
Event Charging with Unit Reservation (ECUR) principle as specified in TS
32.299 \[50\]. The chargeable events for subscriber charging are
associated with MM submission and MM retrieval.

An implementation shall use only one principle for all chargeable events
throughout a given instance of providing MMS service to the user, i.e.
either IEC or ECUR.

The units used for quota shall be service specific and based on an MM.

### 5.3.2 Ro message flows

#### 5.3.2.0 General

The message flows described in the present document specify the charging
communications between MMS R/S and the Online Charging System (OCS) for
different charging scenarios. The MMS messages associated with these
charging scenarios are shown primarily for general information and to
illustrate the charging triggers that are also used for MMS offline
charging.

#### 5.3.2.1 MM submission

Figure 5.3.2.1.1 shows the Credit-Control transactions that are required
between MMS R/S and OCS during the MM submission. In this scenario the
originator MMS User Agent is the party to charge for the MM submission.

Figure 5.3.2.1.1: MMS online charging scenario for MM submission

#### 5.3.2.2 MM retrieval

Figures 5.3.2.2.1 and 5.3.2.2.2 show the Credit-Control transactions
that are required between MMS R/S and OCS during the MM retrieval. In
this scenario the Recipient MMS User Agent is the party to charge for
the reception.

NOTE: For IEC, if the retrieval process is not successful for any reason
(e.g. MM1\_retrieve\_Ack is not received) and another MM1\_retrieve\_req
is received for the same message (identified by the Message ID), it is
OCS logic to determine whether the subsequent requests are charged.

6 Definition of charging information
====================================

6.0 General
-----------

This clause provides the Stage 3 specifications of the CDR type and
content for MMS, in line with the CDR type definitions provided in
clause 5.2.3.

6.1 Data description for MMS offline charging
---------------------------------------------

### 6.1.0 Introduction

Dedicated types of CDRs can be generated for MMS by the MMS R/Ss. The
content of each CDR type is defined in one of the tables that are part
of this clause. For each CDR type the parameter definition includes the
parameter name, description and category.

The MMS R/S CGF shall be able to provide the CDRs at the Billing System
(BS) interface in the format and encoding described in the present
document. In MMS, both fully qualified partial CDRs (FQPC) and reduced
partial CDRs (RPC), as specified in TS 32.240 \[1\] may be supported on
the Bm interface. In line with TS 32.240 \[1\], the support of FQPCs is
mandatory, the support of RPCs is optional.

The following tables provide a brief description of each CDR parameter
and the category in the tables are used according to the charging data
configuration defined in clause 5.4 of TS 32.240 \[1\]. Full definitions
of the parameters, sorted by the parameter name in alphabetical order,
are provided in TS 32.298 \[51\].

### 6.1.1 MMS records for Originator MMS R/S

#### 6.1.1.0 General

The following subclauses specify CDRs created in the OOriginator MMS R/S
based on messages flowing over the MM1 and MM4 reference points. The
CDRs referring to MM4 messages (Originator MM4 \*\*\* CDR) are created
only if the Originator and Recipient MMS R/Ss communicate over the MM4
interface (i.e. the OOriginator MMS R/S is not also the Recipient MMS
R/S). The CDRs referring to MM1 messages (Originator MM1 \*\*\* CDR) are
created regardless of whether the OriginatorOriginator MMS R/S is also
the Recipient MMS R/S or not. Unless otherwise specified, the CDR
parameters are copied from the corresponding MM1 or MM4 message
parameters as applicable.

#### 6.1.1.1 Originator MM1 Submission record (O1S-CDR)

If enabled, an Originator MM1 Submission O1S-CDR shall be produced in
the Originator MMS R/S for each MM submitted in an MM1\_submit.REQ by an
originator MMS User Agent to the Originator MMS R/S if and when the
Originator MMS R/S responds with an MM1\_submit.RES. The operator can
configure whether this CDR, if enabled, shall only be created for
MM1\_submit.RES indicating acceptance of the submitted MM, or also for
the unsuccessful submissions.

NOTE 1: This includes the case where the MM is a reply-MM to an original
MM. In this case the MMS User Agent sending the reply-MM is called the
originator MMS User Agent of this reply-MM and the MMS R/S receiving the
reply-MM in an MM1\_submit.REQ is called the OriginatorOriginator MMS
R/S for this reply-MM.

NOTE 2: The case of an MMS R/S receiving an MM1\_forward.REQ is treated
in clause 6.1.3.

#### 6.1.1.2 Originator MM4 Forward Request record (O4FRq-CDR)

If enabled, an Originator MM4 Forward Request O4FRq-CDR shall be
produced in the Originator MMS R/S if and when the Originator MMS R/S
has sent an MM4\_forward.REQ to the Recipient MMS R/S, regardless of
whether or not an MM4\_forward.RES is received from the recipient. That
is, the CDR is created upon completion of transmission of the
MM4\_forward.REQ.

The MM4\_forward.REQ may be generated as a reaction to an incoming
MM1\_forward.REQ. In this case, the *Originator address* field specifies
the address of the originator MMS User Agent of the original MM, whereas
the address of the forwarding MMS User Agent is contained in the
*Forwarding address* field.

### 6.1.2 MMS records for Recipient MMS R/S

#### 6.1.2.0 General

The following subclauses specify CDRs created in the Recipient MMS R/S
based on messages flowing over the MM1 and MM4 interfaces. The CDRs
referring to MM4 messages (Recipient MM4 \*\*\* CDR) are created only if
the Originator and Recipient MMS R/Ss communicate over the MM4 interface
(i.e. the Recipient MMS R/S is not also the Originator MMS R/S). The
CDRs referring to MM1 messages (Recipient MM1 \*\*\* CDR) are created
regardless of whether the Recipient MMS R/S is also the Originator MMS
R/S or not. Unless otherwise specified the CDR parameters are copied
from the corresponding MM1 or MM4 message parameters as applicable.

#### 6.1.2.12 Recipient MM Deletion record (RMD-CDR)

If enabled, a Recipient MM Deletion RMD-CDR shall be produced in the
Recipient MMS R/S if and when:

1\) the Recipient MMS R/S decides to abandon processing of the MM at any
point after receiving the corresponding MM4\_forward.REQ; or

2\) the Recipient MMS R/S decides to delete the MM because of expiry of
storage time, which may either be indicated in the submit request or
governed by operator procedure(e.g. after successful MM delivery); or

3\) The Recipient MMS R/S decides to delete the MM prior to the expiry
of storage time because it received a request to delete a deferred MM
(i.e. MM for that retrieval has been deferred) from the recipient MMS
User Agent in the corresponding MM1\_delete.REQ and before an
MM1\_cancel.REQ, if any, is sent to the recipient MMS User Agent.

Abandoning the processing of the MM implies that there remains no
knowledge of the MM in the Recipient MMS R/S.

The status code indicates the precise reason for abandoning or deleting
the MM with respect to the MMS transactions specified in TS 23.140
\[201\].

A special case is where the Recipient MMS R/S is also the Forwarding MMS
R/S. In this case only the Originator MM Deletion CDR specified in
clause 6.1.1.8 is required.

### 6.1.5 MMS records for MMS VAS applications

#### 6.1.5.0 General

The following subclauses specify CDRs created in the Originator MMS R/S
based on messages flowing over the MM7 reference point. Unless otherwise
specified, the CDR parameters are copied from the corresponding MM7
message parameters as applicable.

#### 6.1.5.1 MM7 Submission record (MM7S-CDR)

If enabled, an MM7 Submission MM7S-CDR shall be produced in the MMS R/S
for each MM submitted in an MM7\_submit.REQ by a VASP to the MMS R/S if
and when the MMS R/S responds with an MM7\_submit.RES. The operator can
configure whether this CDR, if enabled, shall only be created for
MM7\_submit.RES indicating acceptance of the submitted MM, or also for
the unsuccessful submissions.

6.2 Data description for MMS online charging
--------------------------------------------

### 6.2.1 Ro message contents

#### 6.2.1.0 General

The MMS R/S generate Debit / Reserve Units information that can be
transferred from the CTF to the OCF. For this purpose, MMS online
charging utilises the *Debit Units and Reserve Units* procedure that is
specified in the 3GPP Debit / Reserve Units operation in TS 32.299
\[50\].

The *Debit / Reserve Units* procedure employs the *Debit / Reserve Units
Request* and *Debit / Reserve Units Response* messages.

Table 6.2.1.1 describes the use of these messages for MMS online
charging.

Table 6.2.1.1: MMS online charging messages contents

  -------------------------------- --------- -------------

  -------------------------------- --------- -------------

This clause describes the different Information Elements (IE) used in
the Debit / Reserve Units messages and the charging data configuration
defined in clause 5.4 of TS 32.240 \[1\].
