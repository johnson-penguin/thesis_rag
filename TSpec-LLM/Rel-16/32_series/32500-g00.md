For the purposes of the present document, the terms and definitions
given in TR 21.905 \[1\] and the following apply. A term defined in the
present document takes precedence over the definition of the same term,
if any, in TR 21.905 \[1\].

OAM system. Centralised SON has two variants:

\- NM-Centralised SON: SON solution where SON algorithms are executed at
the Network Management level.

\- EM-Centralised SON: SON solution where SON algorithms are executed at
the Element Management level.

Distributed SON: SON solution where SON algorithms are executed at the
Network Element level.

Hybrid SON: SON solution where SON algorithms are executed at two or
more of the following levels: NE or EM or NM.

4 Concepts and background {#concepts-and-background .list-paragraph}
=========================

4.1 SON concepts {#son-concepts .list-paragraph}
----------------

In order to reduce the operating expenditure (OPEX) associated with the
management of this larger number of nodes from more than one vendor the
concept of the Self-Organizing Network (SON) is introduced. Automation
of some network planning, configuration and optimisation processes via
the use of SON functions can help the network operator to reduce OPEX by
reducing manual involvement in such tasks.

There are four different architectures that are possible for
implementing various SON use cases as defined in clause 3. The
architecture is selected depending on the needs of the SON use cases.

SON algorithms themselves will not be standardised in 3GPP.

5 Business Level Requirements {#business-level-requirements .list-paragraph}
=============================

5.1 Requirements {#requirements .list-paragraph}
----------------

### 5.1.1 General {#general .list-paragraph}

**REQ-SON-CON-01** SON solutions shall provide an easy transition from
operator controlled (open loop) to autonomous (closed loop) operation,
as the network operator gains more trust in the reliability of the SON.

**REQ-SON-CON-02** The SON Architecture and implementation should
support network sharing between network operators. The impact of
individual shared network topographies on proposed SON solutions shall
be decided on a case-by-case basis.

**REQ-SON-CON-05** For operator controlled (open loop) SON function, the
implementation of any update proposed by the SON function shall take
effect only after a response by the Operator.

**REQ-SON-CON-06** For closed loop SON function, the implementation of
any update proposed by the SON function shall take effect without the
need for response by the Operator.

**REQ-SON-CON-07** An NE can operate with SON function or without SON
function and can easily be transferred between these two modes. The
ability to suspend/ resume/ enable/ disable the SON function shall be
determined on a case by case basis.

**REQ-SON-CON-08** An IRPManager shall be able to monitor the specific
results of each particular SON function.

**REQ-SON-CON-09** SON solutions should prevent or minimize negative
influences between SON functions.

5.2 Actor roles {#actor-roles .list-paragraph}
---------------

*IRP Agent. The entity performing the agent role.*

*IRP Manager. The entity performing the manager role.*

*Network Operations Staff. During open loop operation, personnel who
manually review the results of the SON function at intermediate steps in
the particular SON process. The network operations staff decide upon and
manually initiate the appropriate next step in the SON process.*

5.3 Telecommunications resources {#telecommunications-resources .list-paragraph}
--------------------------------

The managed network equipment. The particular equipment and the need for
any SON function(s) within it will be specific to each individual use
case.

The OAM system. The location of any SON function(s) within the OAM
system will also be specific to each individual use case.

*SON Function. The SON algorithm and associated processes that
automatically determines the optimum configuration, connectivity, or
installation parameters for a network element.*

5.4 High-level use cases {#high-level-use-cases .list-paragraph}
------------------------

*A high-level use case diagram may be presented. In order to understand
the use case by subject matter experts, they should be augmented with a
textual description for each use case.\
The description should serve two purposes: to capture the domain
experts\' knowledge and to validate the models in analysis and design
phases with respect to the requirements.\
An example of a high- level use case diagram is given in Appendix I of
M.3020.*

6 Specification level requirements {#specification-level-requirements .list-paragraph}
==================================

6.1 Requirements {#requirements-1 .list-paragraph}
----------------

### 6.1.1 General {#general-1 .list-paragraph}

It is likely that only a subset of SON functions can be standardised
within the timeframe of the first release of the EPS. For that reason a
step-by-step roll out of SON functions should be provided.

### 6.1.2 SON in a Multi-Vendor network {#son-in-a-multi-vendor-network .list-paragraph}

**REQ-SON-CON-003** Self-establishment and self-optimisation shall be
supported in a multiple vendor environment. Standardised procedures and
OAM interfaces are needed to avoid cost-intensive mediation between
different vendor nodes and side effects due to different detailed
solutions (e.g. different optimisation algorithm leads to ping-pong
effects and swinging phenomena).

**REQ-SON-CON-004** The standardised information made available to SON
algorithms shall be consistent, independent of the vendor.

### 6.1.3 Self-Establishment of a new eNodeB {#self-establishment-of-a-new-enodeb .list-paragraph}

Requirements for Self-Establishment of a new eNodeB can be found in
TS 32.501 \[2\].

### 6.1.4 Automatic Neighbour Relation Management {#automatic-neighbour-relation-management .list-paragraph}

Requirements for Automatic Neighbour Relation Management can be found in
TS 32.511 \[3\].

### 6.1.5 Self-Optimisation, Self-Healing {#self-optimisation-self-healing .list-paragraph}

Requirements for Self-Optimisation can be found in TS 32.521 \[4\].

Requirements for Self-Healing can be found in TS 32.541 \[5\].

### 6.1.6 Continuous Optimisation due to Dynamic Changes in the Network {#continuous-optimisation-due-to-dynamic-changes-in-the-network .list-paragraph}

**REQ-SON-CNO-CON-01: An IRPManager shall be able to configure a list of
valid Physical Cell Identifiers (PCI) in the eNB in order to allow
the eNB to choose an appropriate PCI for a cell from within this list to
support distributed PCI assignment. The list of PCIs shall be
cell-specific.**

**REQ-SON-CNO-CON-02: An IRPManager shall be able to configure a
valid PCI in the eNB to support centralized PCI assignment. The PCI
shall be cell-specific.**

**REQ-SON-CNO-CON-03: IRPAgent shall support either the distributed or
the centralized PCI assignment or both.**

**REQ-SON-CNO-FUN-01:** *IRPAgent shall inform IRPManager about the
**PCI** that **is** selected for **each cell**.*

**REQ-SON-CNO-FUN-02: IRPAgent shall inform IRPManager about the reason
for changing the PCI for a cell.**

**REQ-SON-CNO-FUN-03:** IRPAgent shall inform IRPManager if a valid PCI
cannot be found in the list of PCIs configured by IRPManager.

6.2 Actor roles  {#actor-roles-1 .list-paragraph}
