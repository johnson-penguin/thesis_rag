Foreword
========

This Technical Specification (TS) has been produced by the 3^rd^
Generation Partnership Project (3GPP).

The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work
within the TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the
TSG modify the contents of the present document, it will be re-released
by the TSG with an identifying change of release date and an increase in
version number as follows:

Version x.y.z

where:

x the first digit:

1 presented to TSG for information;

2 presented to TSG for approval;

3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.

y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e.
technical enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.

z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been
incorporated in the document.

Introduction
============

The present document is part of a TS-family covering the 3^rd^
Generation Partnership Project; Technical Specification Group Services
and System Aspects; Telecommunication management; as identified below:

**32.311: \"Generic Integration Reference Point (IRP) management;
Requirements\".**

**32.312: \"Generic Integration Reference Point (IRP) management;
Information Service (IS)\".**

32.316: \" Generic Integration Reference Point (IRP) management;
Solution Set (SS) Definitions\".

The Itf-N interface is built up by a number of Integration Reference
Points (IRPs) and a related Name Convention, which realise the
functional capabilities over this interface. The basic structure of the
IRPs is defined in 3GPP TS 32.101 \[1\] and 3GPP TS 32.102 \[2\].

The IRPs support a set of common services. Those features allow to
retrieve IRP profile and IRP supported versions. The present document
contains the requirements of those common services.

1 Scope
=======

The purpose of the present document is to define a common service
supported by all IRPs such as AlarmIRP. The present document is the
\"Requirements\" part. It defines the requirements that shall be
fulfilled by all IRPs, such as AlarmIRP, supporting this common service.

With this common service supported by all IRPs, an IRPManager shall be
able to retrieve the profile of operations and notifications supported
by a given IRP which is name-contained by an IRPAgent. An IRPManager
shall also be able to retrieve the IRPVersions supported by the given
IRP.

2 References
============

The following documents contain provisions which, through reference in
this text, constitute provisions of the present document.

\- References are either specific (identified by date of publication,
edition number, version number, etc.) or non‑specific.

\- For a specific reference, subsequent revisions do not apply.

\- For a non-specific reference, the latest version applies. In the case
of a reference to a 3GPP document (including a GSM document), a
non-specific reference implicitly refers to the latest version of that
document *in the same Release as the present document*.

high level requirements\".

\[2\] 3GPP TS 32.102: \"Telecommunication management; Architecture\".

3 Definitions and abbreviations
===============================

3.1 Definitions
---------------

For the purposes of the present document, the terms and definitions
given in 3GPP TS 32.101 \[1\], 3GPP TS 32.102 \[2\] and the following
apply:

**IRP:** see 3GPP TS 32.102 \[2\].

**IRPAgent:** see 3GPP TS 32.102 \[2\].

**IRPManager:** see 3GPP TS 32.102 \[2\].

**IRP document version number string:** the IRP document version number
(sometimes called \"IRPVersion\") string is used to identify a
technology of a particular IRP Solution Set (SS) specification and its
version number.

For Release 9 and earlier releases, it is derived using the following
rule:

> Take the 3GPP TS/version number on the front page of the SS
> specification, such as "3GPP TS 32.111-3 V4.1.0 (2001-09)\". Discard
> the leading \"3GPP TS\". Discard all characters after and including
> the last period. Eliminate leading and trailing spaces. Reduce
> multiple consecutive spaces to one space. Express the resultant in a
> string. Capitalise all letters of the string.

EXAMPLE 1: If the 3GPP document version number is \"3GPP TS 32.111-3
V4.1.0 (2001-09)\", then the IRP document version number shall be
\"32.111-3 V4.1\".

EXAMPLE 2:If the 3GPP document version number is \"3GPP TS 32.303 V4.1.0
(2001-09)\", then the IRP document version number shall be \"32.303
V4.1\".

For Release 10 and later releases, it is derived using the following
rule:

> Take the 3GPP TS/version number on the front page of the SS
> specification, such as \"3GPP TS 32.111-6 V10.1.0 (2011-06)\", Discard
> the leading \"3GPP TS\". Discard all characters after and including
> the last period. Remove all spaces. Construct a string that is a
> concatenation of '-', the identifier of the Annex where the solution
> set technology is captured (e.g., 'A' for Annex A) and a trailing
> space. Insert the concatenated string before 'V', Express the
> resultant in a string. Capitalise all letters of the string.

EXAMPLE 3: If the 3GPP document version number is \"3GPP TS 32.111-6
V10.1.0 (2011-06)\", then the IRP document version number shall be:

\- \"32.111-6-A V10.1\" for CORBA Solution Set;

\- \"32.111-6-B V10.1\" for XML Definitions;

\- \"32.111-6-C V10.1\" for SOAP Solution Set.

EXAMPLE 4: If the 3GPP document version number is \"3GPP TS 32.306
V10.1.0 (2011-09)\", then the IRP document version number shall be:

\- \"32.306-A V10.1\" for CORBA Solution Set;

\- \"32.306-B V10.1\" for XML Defintions;

\- \"32.306-C V10.1\" for SOAP Solution Set.

4 Generic IRP functions over Itf-N
==================================

The requirements for the generic IRP service over Itf-N are provided in
the following clauses.

4.1 Version retrieval function 
------------------------------

An IRPAgent may support one or multiple IRP instances simultaneously
(e.g. AlarmIRP instances, BulkCMIRP instances, etc.).

The set of capabilities of each IRP instance is fully identified by the
version number of the corresponding IRP specification (i.e. the "IRP
document version number string" or in short, the IRPVersion; see clause
3.1.).

An IRP instance shall provide a function to allow IRPManager to retrieve
all its (i.e. IRP instance's) supported IRPVersion(s) over Itf-N.

An IRPManager may then decide if it wants to communicate with the IRP
instance.

4.2 Profiles retrieval functions
--------------------------------

Each IRP supported by an IRPAgent provides a set of operations and
notifications. It is possible to define in each IRP Information Service
(IS) some operations and notification that are optional, which means
that the final implementation of those operations and notifications is
vendor dependant. Similarly, some parameters of operations and
notifications may be defined as optional in the IRP IS.

It shall be possible for an IRPManager to retrieve over Itf-N the
profile of an IRP of a given version: the profile shall provide
information such as name of supported operations and notifications, and
the list of supported parameters for each supported operation and
notification.
