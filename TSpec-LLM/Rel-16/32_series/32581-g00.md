Information attributes, as defined in 3GPP TS.32.111-2, reference \[7\].

**REQ-OAMP\_FM-FUN-005** The HNB shall maintain the following
information:

support of one of the two security mechanisms determined by the Network
Operator's Security Policies:

\- utilising SSL/TLS outside the IPsec Tunnel

-within the IPsec Tunnel with the option to utilise SSL/TLS within the
IPsec Tunnel for additional end-to-end security

TR-069 CPE devices are currently factory programmed with a Bootstrap HMS
URL only and therefore the HNB capable CPEs requiring to utilise IPsec
for connection to the HMS either require to be factory programmed with
Bootstrap Security Gateway/IPsec Information or this information is
supplied outside of the IPsec tunnel before tunnel establishment
utilising SSL/TLS.

**REQ-OAMP\_SM-FUN--002** The HNB shall provide a capability to prevent
