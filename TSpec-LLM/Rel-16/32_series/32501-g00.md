4.2 Automatic Radio Configuration Data handling Function (ARCF) Concept
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

### 4.2.1 Definitions

**ARCF Data:** ARCF data are the data which are required for successful
activation (of e.g. cell, eNB) that require coordination between several
cells and cannot be generated below Itf-N. Some of the ARCF data may be
used directly as eNodeB configuration data and some of the ARCF data may
be used to generate more other eNodeB configuration data. eNodeB will
use the ARCF data together with other configuration data as initial
eNodeB radio configuration data. The eNodeB initial radio configuration
data will be used for self-configuration.

**ARCF Handling:** This includes ARCF data preparation, ARCF Data
Transfer and ARCF Data Validation.

**ARCF Data Preparation:** This makes the ARCF data ready in operator's
network management system. How to prepare the ARCF data in operator's
network management system is out of scope of this specification.

**ARCF Data Transfer:** This transfers the ARCF data from IRPManager to
the IRPAgent,

**ARCF Data Validation:** This validates the syntax and semantics of
ARCF data. It takes place in the IRPAgent.

4.3 Multi-Vendor Plug and Play eNB connection to network Concept
----------------------------------------------------------------

### 4.3.1 General description

The basic idea of Plug and Play is to avoid pre-configuration of an eNB
as far as possible. In an ideal PnP world an eNB equipment is totally
agnostic of its future purpose, its location in the network, its
addresses, its basic configuration parameters etc\... All this
information is only supplied step by step during the PnP process.

The required information for the new eNB is stored at specific places.
The eNB needs to know how to access these places. The PnP process
provides this information to the eNB.

The entities involved in the PnP concept are eNB, DHCP server, DNS
Server, Certification Authority server, Element Manager (including the
Initial and Serving Element Managers that could be the same in certain
deployment scenarios), Security Gateway.

The Plug and Play includes \"Plug and Connect\" and Self-Configuration.
The basic steps of Plug and Connect are described in clause 6.4.3.

After Plug and Connect Self-Configuration procedures are used to
complete Plug and Play.

### 4.3.2 Network Scenarios

#### 4.3.2.1 eNB connected via a Non-Secure, Operator Controlled Network 

An eNB is typically connected to the operator\'s network according to
one of the following scenarios:

In Figure 4.3.2-1, the eNB is connected directly to a network controlled
by the operator. The eNB can use IP Infrastructure services (DHCP
Server, DNS Server, etc.) in the Non-secure Operator Network. The
Operator has full control of these nodes. One or more Security Gateways
protect the Secure Operator Network from malicious eNBs. Within the
Secure Operator Network, there are also IP Infrastructure nodes.

height="3.046527777777778in"}

Figure 4.3.2-1 eNB connected to an Non-Secure Operator Network

#### 4.3.2.2 eNB connected via an External Network

In Figure 4.3.2-2, the eNB is connected to a network controlled by an
entity external to the Operator. In contrast to the first scenario, the
IP Infrastructure nodes in the External Network are not fully controlled
by the operator. In both cases, the eNB needs to traverse the Security
Gateway(s) to access the nodes in the Secure Operator Network.

![](media/image4.wmf){width="6.695138888888889in" height="3.225in"}

Figure 4.3.2-2 eNB connected to an External Network

#### 4.3.2.3 eNB connection to the OAM Network and multiple CNs via separate SeGWs

Following certificate enrolment with the operator's CA, an eNB
establishes a secure tunnel to the SeGW of the OAM network. Through this
tunnel it then connects to its DM from which it receives software
updates and configuration information, including its transport
configuration to the core network(s) it is supposed to connect to. It
then typically establishes a separate secure tunnel to the SeGW of the
operator's core network. In the case of RAN Sharing, the eNB may
establish further tunnels to other Participating Operators' core
networks. The OAM and CN SeGWs may or may not be separate physical
entities in practice.

Figure 4.3.2-3 shows an example of an eNB connected to the OAM Network
and multiple CNs via separate SeGWs.

height="4.360416666666667in"}

Figure 4.3.2-3 Example of eNB connected to OAM Network and multiple CNs
via separate SeGWs

### 4.3.3 Security Aspects

#### 4.3.3.1 Root Certificate Acquisition:

In accordance to TS 33.310 \[yy\] §9.2 there are two options how to
obtain the operator root certificate:

Option 1: The operator root certificate is provisioned in the base
station prior to the CMPv2 protocol run

Option 2: The operator root certificate is provisioned in the base
station during the CMPv2 protocol run (as part of the Initialisation
Response)

The required pre-provisioning in option 1 is against the basic idea of
PnP to minimize pre-provisioning. Therefore from the PnP perspective
Option 2 is more interesting. From a security point of view the
following considerations are relevant:

Option 2 has the risk that during the CMP initialisation a man-in the
middle attack could take place. In order to be successful, such an
attack must happen timely during the actual CMP initialization run and
the attacker must have access to the access network between base station
and RA/CA.\
This risk can be assessed as acceptable, given (a) the risks which are
present at Options 1's prior provisioning -- see below, (b) the short
time window of vulnerability, (c) the closed access networks of many
operators. In addition, most attacks will only lead to inability of the
base station to connect to the network, or to misuse of the new base
station by the attacker. The operator should notice it soon if the base
station does not connect, and will investigate the issue.

Option 1 avoids the above "time window of vulnerability". On the other
hand it requires pre-provisioning of the operator root certificate,
either in factory or on-site by service personnel. There is the risk of
a security leak during the provisioning of the root certificate within
the vendor / commissioning environment.

It seems questionable from a security point of view to allow option 2
also in public Internet (without operator-trusted access network). There
the attacks stated above are more probable, and an attacker may even
install some (static) catching or spoofing equipment in the public
Internet to always capture such "initialization requests".

It is up to the network operator to choose the option with is preferable
from his point of view (risk assessment, Plug and Play importance).

#### 4.3.3.2 Number of CA servers

There could be one or more RA/CA server, e. g. one per vendor. If more
than one RA/CA server is deployed with one RA/CA server per vendor then
the vendor identification would be needed either in the FQDN of the RA
server or in the information from the IP AutoConfiguration Service
carrying the information about RA/CA server.

#### 4.3.3.3 Number of OAM SeGWs

There could be one or more OAM SeGW, e. g. one per vendor. If more than
one OAM SeGW is deployed with one OAM SeGW per vendor then the vendor
identification would be needed either in the FQDN of the OAM SeGW or in
the information from the IP AutoConfiguration Service carrying the
information about OAM SeGW.

| Begins when       | **The eNB is powered up.** |                   |
+-------------------+----------------------------+-------------------+
| Step 1 (M)        | **If a VLAN ID is          |                   |
|                   | available the eNB uses     |                   |
|                   | it**. Otherwise the eNB    |                   |
|                   | uses the **native VLAN     |                   |
|                   | where PnP traffic is sent  |                   |

| Step 5 (M)        | The eNB acquires the IP    |                   |
|                   | address of the OAM SeGW.   |                   |
|                   | The FQDN of the OAM SeGW   |                   |
|                   | may be pre-configured in   |                   |
|                   | the eNB or the FQDN or the |                   |

|                   | FQDNs are resolved through |                   |
|                   | the DNS if necessary.      |                   |
+-------------------+----------------------------+-------------------+
| Step 6 (M)        | The eNB establishes a      |                   |
|                   | secure connection (tunnel) |                   |

Editor's note: The CA/RA server itself may be protected by a SeGW.

Security aspects -- e.g. prevention of unauthorized network access and
of fake parameters supplied to the eNBs etc. -have special importance.
Security related sub-steps to establish secure connections are not shown
in table 6.4.3-1. More security aspects are described in a specific
