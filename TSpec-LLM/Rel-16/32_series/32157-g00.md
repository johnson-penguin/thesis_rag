W4 Model

W4.1 Imported and associated information entities

W4.1.1 Imported information entities and local labels

*This clause identifies a list of information entities (e.g. information
object class, interface, attribute) that have been defined in other
specifications and that are imported in the present (target)
specification. All imported entities shall be treated as if they are
defined locally in the target specification. One usage of import is for
inheritance purpose.*

*Each element of this list is a pair (label reference, local label). The
label reference contains the name of the original specification where
the information entity is defined, the information entity type and its
name. The local label contains the name of the information entity that
appears in the target specification, and the entity name in the local
label shall be kept identical to the name defined in the original
specification. The local label can then be used throughout the target
specification instead of that which appears in the label reference.*

This information is provided in a table. An example of such a table is
given here below:

  ------------------------------------------------------ -------------
  Label reference                                        Local label
  3GPP TS 32.622 \[xy\], information object class, Top   Top
  ------------------------------------------------------ -------------

W4.1.2 Associated information entities and local labels

*This clause identifies a list of information entities (e.g. information
object class, interface, attribute) that have been defined in other
specifications and that are associated with the information entities
defined in the present (target) specification. For the associated
information entity, only its properties (e.g., DN (see 5.2.2 of 32.156
\[4\]), attribute (see 5.2.1 of 32.156 \[4\]) of an instance of the
associated information entity) used as associated information needs to
be supported locally in the target specification.*

*Each element of this list is a pair (label reference, local label). The
label reference contains the name of the original specification where
the information entity is defined, the information entity type and its
name. The local label contains the name of the information entity that
appears in the target specification. The local label can then be used
throughout the target specification instead of that which appears in the
label reference.*

*This information is p*rovided in a table. An example of such a table is
given here below:

  ----------------------------------------- -------------
  Label reference                           Local label

  ----------------------------------------- -------------

W4.2 Class diagram

W4.2.1 Relationships

*This first set of diagrams represents all classes defined in this IS
with all their relationships and all their attributes, including
relationships with imported information entities (if any). These
diagrams shall contain class cardinalities (for associations as well as
containment relationships) and may also contain role names. These shall
be UML compliant class diagrams (see also \[*4*\]).*

*Characteristics (attributes, relationships) of imported information
entities need not to be repeated in the diagrams. Allowable classes are
specified in \[4\].*

*Use this as the first paragraph: \"*This clause depicts the set of
classes (e.g. IOCs) that encapsulates the information relevant for this
IRP. This clause provides an overview of the relationships between
relevant classes in UML. Subsequent clauses provide more detailed
specification of various aspects of these classes.\"

W4.2.2 Inheritance

*This second set of diagrams represents the inheritance hierarchy of all
classes defined in this specification. These diagrams do not need to
contain the complete inheritance hierarchy but shall at least contain
the parent classes of all classes defined in the present document. By
default, a class inherits from the class \"top\".*

*Characteristics (attributes, relationships) of imported classes need
not to be repeated in the diagrams.*

*NOTE: some inheritance relationships presented in clause W4.2.2 can be
repeated in clause W4.2.1 to enhance readability.*

*Use \"*This subclause depicts the inheritance relationships.\" *as the
first paragraph.*

W4.3 Class definitions

*Each class is defined using the following structure.*

*Inherited items (attributes etc.) shall not be shown, as they are
defined in the parent class(es) and thus valid for the subclass.*

W4.3.a InformationObjectClassName

*InformationObjectClassName is the name of the information object
class.*

*The \"a\" represents a number, starting at 1 and increasing by 1 with
each new definition of a class.*

W4.3.a.1 Definition

*This clause is written in natural language. The \<definition\> clause
refers to the class itself.*

*Optionally, information on traceabi*lity back to one or more
requirements supported by this class can be defined here, in the
following form:

  ----------------------- ------------------- --------------------------
  Referenced TS           Requirement label   Comment
  3GPP TS 32.xyz \[xy\]   REQ-SM-CON-23       *Optional clarification*
  3GPP TS 32.xyz \[xy\]   REQ-SM-FUN-11       *Optional clarification*
  ----------------------- ------------------- --------------------------

W4.3.a.2 Attributes

*This clause presents the list of attributes, which are the manageable
properties of the class. Each attribute is characterised by some of the
attribute properties (see Table 1 of \[4\]), i.e. supportQualifier,
isReadable, isWritable, isInvariant and isNotifyable.*

*The legal values and their semantics for attribute properties are
defined in \[4\].*

*This information is provided in a table.*

*An example below indicates*

  ---------------- ------------------- ------------ ------------ ------------- --------------
  Attribute name   Support Qualifier   isReadable   isWritable   isInvariant   isNotifyable
  eNodeBId         M                   M            \-           M             M
  ---------------- ------------------- ------------ ------------ ------------- --------------

*Another example below indicates that the attribute password1 is not
readable, is writable, is not an invariant and no
notifyAttributeValueChange* will be emitted when the attribute value is
changed.

  ---------------- ------------------- ------------ ------------ ------------- --------------
  Attribute name   Support Qualifier   isReadable   isWritable   isInvariant   isNotifyable
  password1        O                   \-           M            \-            \-
  ---------------- ------------------- ------------ ------------ ------------- --------------

*Another example below indicates that the attribute password2 and
password1 (in example above) has same qualifiers for the shown
properties except that of isReadable. In the case of password1, the
standard specification determines the qualifier to be M, i.e. it is
readable. In the case of password2, the standard specification does not
make a determination. The vendor would make the determination if the
attribute is readable or not* readable.

  ---------------- ------------------- ------------ ------------ ------------- --------------
  Attribute name   Support Qualifier   isReadable   isWritable   isInvariant   isNotifyable
  password2        O                   O            M            \-            \-
  ---------------- ------------------- ------------ ------------ ------------- --------------

*In case there is one or more attributes related to role (see section
5.2.9 of \[4\]), the attributes related to role shall be specified at
the bottom of the table with a divider \"Attribute related to role\",*
as shown in the following example:

  ------------------------------- ------------------- ------------ ------------ ------------- --------------
  Attribute name                  Support Qualifier   isReadable   isWritable   isInvariant   isNotifyable
  aTMChannelTerminationPointid    M                   M            \-           M             M
  **...**                                                                                     
  **...**                                                                                     
  **Attribute related to role**                                                               
  theATMPathTerminationPoint      M                   M            \-           \-            M
  theIubLink                      M                   M            \-           \-            M
  ------------------------------- ------------------- ------------ ------------ ------------- --------------

*This clause shall state \"None.\" when there is no attribute to
define.*

W4.3.a.3 Attribute constraints

*This clause presents constraints for the attributes, and one use is to
present the predicates for conditional qualifiers (CM/CO).*

This information is provided in a table. An example of such a table is
given here below:

  ---------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Name                                     Definition
  pci CM write qualifier                   Centralized PCI assignment (see TS 32.500, ref \[xy \] clause 6.1.6) is supported.
  pciList CM support qualifier             Distributed PCI assignment (see TS 32.500, ref \[ xy\] clause 6.1.6) is supported.
  partOfSectorPower CM support qualifier   The IOC SectorEquipmentFunction is used.
  attributeX max value                     The value of attributeX shall be within the specified value range but may never be higher than the value of attributeY.
  ---------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*This clause shall state \"None.\" when there is no attribute constraint
to define.*

W4.3.a.4 Notifications

*This clause, for this class, presents one of the following options:*

a\) The cla*ss defines (and independent from those inherited) the
support of a set of notifications that is identical to that defined in
clause W4.5. In such case, use \"The common notifications defined in
clause W4.5 are valid for this class, without exceptions or additions.\"
as the lone sentence of this clause.*

*b) The class defines (and independent from those inherited) the support
of a set of notifications that is a superset of that defined in clause
W4.5. In such case, use \"The common notifications defined in clause
W4.5 are valid for this IOC. In addition, the following set of
notification is also valid.\" as the lone paragraph of this clause.
Then, define the 'additional' notifications in a table. See clause W4.5
for the notification table format.*

*c) The class defines (and independent from those inherited) the support
of a set of notifications that is not identical to, nor a superset of,
that defined in clause W4.5. In such case, use \"The common
notifications defined in clause W4.5 are not valid for this IOC. The set
of notifications defined in the following table is valid.\" as the lone
paragraph of this clause. Specify the set of notifications in a table.
See clause W4.5 for the notification table format.*

*d) The class does not define (and independent from those inherited) the
support of any notification. In such case, use \"There is n*o
notification defined.\" as the lone sentence of this clause.

*The notifications identified (i.e. option-a, option-b and option-c
above) in this clause are notifications that can be emitted across the
Itf-N, where the \"object class\" and \"object instance\" parameters of
the notification header (see note 2) of these notifications identifies
an instance of the class (or its direct or indirect derived class)
defined by the encapsulating clause (i.e. clause W4.3.a).*

*The notifications identified (i.e. option-a and option-b above) in this
clause, may originate from implementation object(s) whose identifier may
or may not be the same as that carried in the notification parameters
\"object class\" and \"object instance\". Hence the identification of
notifications in this clause does not imply nor identify those
notifications as being originated from an instance of the class (or its
direct or indirect derived class) defined by the encapsulating clause
(i.e. clause W4.3.a).*

*This clause shall state \"This class does not support any
notification.\" (see option-c) when there is no notification defined for
this class. (Note that if its parent class has defined some
notifications, the implementation of this class is capable of emitting
those inherited defined notifications.)*

*The notification header is defined in the notification IRP Information
service TS 32.302 \[5\].*

*The qualifier of a notification, specified in Notification Table,
indicates if an implementation can generate a notification carrying the
DN of the subject class. The qualifier of a notification, specified in
an Interface IRP, indicates if an implementation of the Interface IRP
can generate such notification in general.*

*An IRPManager can receive notification-XYZ that carries DN (the
\"object class\" and \"object instance\") of class-ABC instance if and
only if:*

a\) The class-ABC Notification Table defines the notification-XYZ and

b\) The class-ABC instance implementation supports this notification-XYZ
and

c\) An Interface IRP defines the notification-XYZ and

d\) The Interface IRP implementation supports this notification-XYZ.

W4.3.a.5 State diagram

*This subclause contains state diagrams. A state diagram of an
information object class defines permitted states of this information
object class and the transitions between those states. A state is
expressed in terms of individual attribute values or a combination of
attribute values or involvement in relationships of the information
object class being defined. This shall be a UML compliant state
diagram.*

*This subclause shall state "None." when there is no State diagram
defined.*

W4.4 Attribute definitions

W4.4.1 Attribute properties

*It has a lone paragraph* \"The following table defines the properties
of attributes that are specified in the present document. \".

*Each information attribute is defined using the following structure.*

*Inherited attributes shall not be shown, as they are defined in the
parent class(es) and thus valid for this class.*

*An attribute has properties (see Table 1 of \[4\]). Some properties of
an attribute are defined in W4.3.a.2 (e.g. Support Qualifier). The
remaining properties of an attribute (e.g. documentation, default value)
are defined here.*

*The information is provided in a table. In case a) attributes of the
same name are specified in more than one class and b) the attributes
have different properties, then the attribute names (first column)
should be prefixed with the class name followed by a period.*

*An example is given* below:

+----------------+----------------------------------+---------------------------+

*This clause shall state* \"*None.*\" *if there is no attribute to
define.*

W4.4.2 Constraints

*This clause indicates whether there are any constraints affecting
attributes. Each constraint is defined by a triplet (propertyName,
affectedAttributes, propertyDefinition). PropertyDefinitions are
expressed in natural language.*

An example is given here below:

  ----------------------- ----------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------
  Name                    Affected attribute(s)   Definition
  inv\_TimerConstraints   ntfTimeTickTimer        The ntfTimeTickTimer is lower than or equal to ntfTimeTick.
  ----------------------- ----------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------

*This clause shall state \"None.\" if there is no constraint.*

W4.5 Common notifications

*This clause presents notifications that can be referred to by any class
defined in the specification. This information is provided in tables.*

W4.5.1 Alarm notifications

*The following quoted text shall be copied as the only paragraph of this
clause.*

\"This clause presents a list of notifications, defined in \[x\], that
IRPManager can receive. The notification header attribute
objectClass/objectInstance, defined in \[y\], shall capture the DN of an
instance of a class defined in this specification.\"

The information is provided in a table. The following is an example.

  ---------------- ----------- -------
  Name             Qualifier   Notes
  notifyNewAlarm   M           \--
  ---------------- ----------- -------

W4.5.2 Configuration notifications

*The following quoted text shall be copied as the only paragraph of this
clause.*

\"This clause presents a list of notifications, defined in \[x\], that
IRPManager can receive. The notification header attribute
objectClass/objectInstance, defined in \[z\], shall capture the DN of an
instance of a class defined in this specification.\"

The information is provided in a table. The following is an example.

  ---------------------------- ----------- -------
  Name                         Qualifier   Notes
  notifyAttributeValueChange   O           \--

W4.6 System State Model

*Some configurations of information are special or complex enough to
justify the usage of a state diagram to clarify them. A state diagram in
this clause defines permitted states of the system and the transitions
between those states. A state is expressed in terms of a combination of
attribute values constraints or involvement in relationships of one or
more information object classes.*

4.3 Template for Interface IRP IS

Y5 Model

Y5.1 Imported and associated information entities

Y5.1.1 Imported information entities and local labels

*This clause identifies a list of information entities (e.g. information
object class, interface, attribute) that have been defined in other
specifications and that are imported in the present (target)
specification. All imported entities shall be treated as if they are
defined locally in the target specification. One usage of import is for
inheritance purpose.*

*Each element of this list is a pair (label reference, local label). The
label reference contains the name of the original specification where
the information entity is defined, the information entity type and its
name. The local label contains the name of the information entity that
appears in the target specification, and the entity name in the local
label shall be kept identical to the name defined in the original
specification. The local label can then be used throughout the target
specification instead of that which appears in the label reference.*

*This information is provided in a table. An example of such a table is
gi*ven here below:

  ------------------------------------------------------ -------------
  Label reference                                        Local label
  3GPP TS 32.622 \[xy\], information object class, Top   Top
  ------------------------------------------------------ -------------

Y5.1.2 Associated information entities and local labels

*This clause identifies a list of information entities (e.g. information
object class, interface, attribute) that have been defined in other
specifications and that are associated with the information entities
defined in the present (target) specification. For the associated
information entity, only its properties (e.g., DN (see 5.2.2 of 32.156
\[4\]), attribute (see 5.2.1 of 32.156 \[4\]) of an instance of the
associated information entity) used as associated information needs to
be supported locally in the target specification.*

*Each element of this list is a pair (label reference, local label). The
label reference contains the name of the original specification where
the information entity is defined, the information entity type and its
name. The local label contains the name of the information entity that
appears in the target specification. The local label can then be used
throughout the target specification instead of that which appears in the
label reference.*

This information is provided in a table. An example of such a table is
given here below:

  ----------------------------------------- -------------

Y5.2 Class diagram

Y5.2.1 Relationships

*This first set of diagrams represents all classes defined in this IS
with all their relationships and all their attributes, including
relationships with imported information entities (if any). These
diagrams shall contain class cardinalities (for associations as well as
containment relationships) and may also contain role names. These shall
be UML compliant class diagrams (see also \[*4*\]).*

*Characteristics (attributes, relationships) of imported information
entities need not to be repeated in the diagrams. Allowable classes are
specified in \[4\].*

*Use this as the first paragraph: \"*This clause depicts the set of
classes (e.g. IOCs) that encapsulates the information relevant for this
IRP. This clause provides an overview of the relationships between
relevant classes in UML. Subsequent clauses provide more detailed
specification of various aspects of these classes.\"

Y5.2.2 Inheritance

*This second set of diagrams represents the inheritance hierarchy of all
classes defined in this specification. These diagrams do not need to
contain the complete inheritance hierarchy but shall at least contain
the parent classes of all classes defined in the present document. By
default, a class inherits from the class \"top\".*

*Characteristics (attributes, relationships) of imported classes need
not to be repeated in the diagrams.*

*NOTE: some inheritance relationships presented in clause Y5.2.2 can be
repeated in clause Y5.2.1 to enhance readability.*

*Use \"*This subclause depicts the inheritance relationships.\" *as the
first paragraph.*

Y5.3 Class definitions

*Each class is defined using the following structure.*

*Inherited items (attributes etc.) shall not be shown, as they are
defined in the parent class(es) and thus valid for the subclass.*

Y5.3.a InformationObjectClassName

*InformationObjectClassName is the name of the information object
class.*

*The \"a\" represents a number, starting at 1 and increasing by 1 with
each new definition of a class.*

Y5.3.a.1 Definition

*This clause is written in natural language. The \<definition\> clause
refers to the class itself.*

Optionally, information on traceability back to one or more requirements
supported by this class can be defined here, in the following form:

  ----------------------- ------------------- --------------------------
  Referenced TS           Requirement label   Comment
  3GPP TS 32.xyz \[xy\]   REQ-SM-CON-23       *Optional clarification*
  3GPP TS 32.xyz \[xy\]   REQ-SM-FUN-11       *Optional clarification*
  ----------------------- ------------------- --------------------------

Y5.3.a.2 Attributes

*This clause presents the list of attributes, which are the manageable
properties of the class. Each attribute is characterised by some of the
attribute properties (see Table 1 of \[4\]), i.e. supportQualifier,
isReadable, isWritable, isInvariant and isNotifyable.*

*The legal values and their semantics for attribute properties are
defined in \[4\].*

*This information is provided in a table.*

*An example below indicates*

  ---------------- ------------------- ------------ ------------ ------------- --------------
  Attribute name   Support Qualifier   isReadable   isWritable   isInvariant   isNotifyable
  eNodeBId         M                   M            \-           M             M
  ---------------- ------------------- ------------ ------------ ------------- --------------

*Another example below indicates that the attribute password1 is not
readable, is writable, is not an invariant and no
notifyAttributeValueChange* will be emitted when the attribute value is
changed.

  ---------------- ------------------- ------------ ------------ ------------- --------------
  Attribute name   Support Qualifier   isReadable   isWritable   isInvariant   isNotifyable
  password1        O                   \-           M            \-            \-
  ---------------- ------------------- ------------ ------------ ------------- --------------

*Another example below indicates that the attribute password2 and
password1 (in example above) has same qualifiers for the shown
properties except that of isReadable. In the case of password1, the
standard specification determines the qualifier to be M, i.e. it is
readable. In the case of password2,* the standard specification does not
make a determination. The vendor would make the determination if the
attribute is readable or not readable.

  ---------------- ------------------- ------------ ------------ ------------- --------------
  Attribute name   Support Qualifier   isReadable   isWritable   isInvariant   isNotifyable
  password2        O                   O            M            \-            \-
  ---------------- ------------------- ------------ ------------ ------------- --------------

*In cas*e there is one or more attributes related to role (see section
5.2.9 of \[4\]), the attributes related to role shall be specified at
the bottom of the table with a divider \"Attribute related to role\", as
shown in the following example:

  ------------------------------- ------------------- ------------ ------------ ------------- --------------
  Attribute name                  Support Qualifier   isReadable   isWritable   isInvariant   isNotifyable
  aTMChannelTerminationPointid    M                   M            \-           M             M
  **...**                                                                                     
  **...**                                                                                     
  **Attribute related to role**                                                               
  theATMPathTerminationPoint      M                   M            \-           \-            M
  theIubLink                      M                   M            \-           \-            M
  ------------------------------- ------------------- ------------ ------------ ------------- --------------

*This clause shall state \"None.\" when there is no attribute to
define.*

Y5.3.a.3 Attribute constraints

*This clause presents constraints for the attributes, and one use is to
present the predicates for conditional qualifiers (CM/CO).*

*This information is provided in a table. An example of such a table is*
given here below:

  ---------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Name                                     Definition
  pci CM write qualifier                   Centralized PCI assignment (see TS 32.500, ref \[xy\] clause 6.1.6) is supported.
  pciList CM support qualifier             Distributed PCI assignment (see TS 32.500, ref \[xy\] clause 6.1.6) is supported.
  partOfSectorPower CM support qualifier   The IOC SectorEquipmentFunction is used.
  attributeX max value                     The value of attributeX shall be within the specified value range but may never be higher than the value of attributeY.
  ---------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*This clause shall state \"None.\" when there is no attribute constraint
to define.*

Y5.3.a.4 Notifications

*This clause, for this class, presents one of the following options:*

*a) The class defines (and independent from those inherited) the support
of a set of notifications that is identical to that defined in clause
Y5.5. In such case, use \"The common notifications defined in clause
Y5.5 are valid for this class, without exceptions or additions.\" as the
lone sentence of this clause.*

*b) The class defines (and independent from those inherited) the support
of a set of notifications that is a superset of that defined in clause
Y5.5. In such case, use \"The common notifications defined in clause
Y5.5 are valid for this IOC. In addition, the following set of
notification is also valid.\" as the lone paragraph of this clause.
Then, define the 'additional' notifications in a table. See clause Y5.5
for the notification table format.*

*c) The class defines (and independent from those inherited) the support
of a set of notifications that is not identical to, nor a superset of,
that defined in clause Y5.5. In such case, use \"The common
notifications defined in clause Y5.5 are not valid for this IOC. The set
of notifications defined in the following table is valid.\" as the lone
paragraph of this clause. Specify the set of notifications in a table.
See clause Y5.5 for the notification table format.*

*d) The class does not define (and independent from those inherited) the
support of any notification. In such case, use \"There is no
notification defined.\" as the lone sentence of this clause.*

*The notifications identified (i.e. option-a, option-b and option-c
above) in this clause are notifications that can be emitted across the
Itf-N, where the \"object class\" and \"object instance\" parameters of
the notification header (see note 2) of these notifications identifies
an instance of the class (or its direct or indirect derived class)
defined by the encapsulating clause (i.e. clause Y5.3.a).*

*The notifications identified (i.e. option-a and option-b above) in this
clause, may originate from implementation object(s) whose identifier may
or may not be the same as that carried in the notification parameters
\"object class\" and \"object instance\". Hence the identification of
notifications in this clause does not imply nor identify those
notifications as being originated from an instance of the class (or its
direct or indirect derived class) defined by the encapsulating clause
(i.e. clause Y5.3.a).*

*This clause shall state \"This class does not support any
notification.\" (see option-c) when there is no notification defined for
this class. (Note that if its parent class has defined some
notifications, the implementation of this class is capable of emitting
those inherited defined notifications.)*

*The notification header is defined in the notification IRP Information
service TS 32.302 \[5\].*

*The qualifier of a notification, specified in Notification Table,
indicates if an implementation can generate a notification carrying the
DN of the subject class. The qualifier of a notification, specified in
an Interface IRP, indicates if an implementation of the Interface IRP
can generate such notification in general.*

*An IRPManager can receive notification-XYZ that carries DN (the
\"object class\" and \"object instance\") of class-ABC instance if and
only if:*

*a) The class-ABC Notification Table defines the notification-XYZ and*

*b) The class-ABC instance implementation supports this notification-XYZ
and*

*c) An Interface IRP defines the notification-XYZ and*

*d) The Interface IRP implementation supports this notification-XYZ.*

Y5.3.a.5 State diagram

*This subclause contains state diagrams. A state diagram of an
information object class defines permitted states of this information
object class and the transitions between those states. A state is
expressed in terms of individual attribute values or a combination of
attribute values or involvement in relationships of the information
object class being defined. This shall be a UML compliant state
diagram.*

*This subclause shall state "None." when there is no State diagram
defined.*

Y5.4 Attribute definitions

Y5.4.1 Attribute properties

*It has a lone paragraph* \"The following table defines the properties
of attributes that are specified in the present document. \".

*Each information attribute is defined using the following structure.*

*Inherited attributes shall not be shown, as they are defined in the
parent class(es) and thus valid for this class.*

*An attribute has properties (see Table 1 of \[4\]). Some properties of
an attribute are defined in Y5.3.a.2 (e.g. Support Qualifier). The
remaining properties of an attribute (e.g. documentation, default value)
are defined here.*

*The information is provided in a table. In case a) attributes of the
same name are specified in more than one class and b) the attributes
have different properties, then the attribute names (first column)
should be prefixed with the class name followed by a period.*

Y6 Interface Definition

Y6.1 Class diagram representing interfaces

*Each interface is defined in one or more UML compliant class diagrams
(see also 3GPP TS 32.156 \[*4*\]).*

Y6.2 Generic rules

*The following rules are relevant for all ISs. They shall simply be
copied as part of the specification.*

*Rule 1: each operation with at least one input parameter supports a
pre-condition valid\_input\_parameter which indicates that all input
parameters shall be valid with regards to their information type.
Additionally, each such operation supports an exception
operation\_failed\_invalid\_input\_parameter which is raised when
pre-condition valid\_input\_parameter is false. The exception has the
same entry and exit state.*

*Rule 2: Each operation with at least one optional input parameter
supports a set of pre-conditions
supported\_optional\_input\_parameter\_yyy where \"yyy\" is the name of
the optional input parameter and the\
pre-condition indicates that the operation supports the named optional
input parameter. Additionally, each such operation supports an exception
operation\_failed\_unsupported\_optional\_input\_parameter\_yyy which is
raised when (a) the pre-condition
supported\_optional\_input\_parameter\_yyy is false and (b) the named
optional input parameter is carrying information. The exception has the
same entry and exit state.*

*Rule 3: each operation shall support a generic exception
operation\_failed\_internal\_problem which is raised when an internal
problem occurs and that the operation cannot be completed. The exception
has the same entry and exit state.*

Y6.b InterfaceName Interface (supportQualifier)

*InterfaceName is the name of the interface followed by a qualifier
indicating whether the interface is Mandatory (M), Optional (O),
Conditional-Mandatory (CM), Conditional-Optional (CO), or SS-Conditional
(C).*

*\"b\" represents a number, starting at 3 and increasing by 1 with each
new definition of an interface.*

*Each interface is defined by its name and by a sequence of operations
or notifications.*

*Interfaces related to operations shall be listed before the interfaces
related to notifications.*

*If the interface is related to operation(s), the following Y.b.a*
\"Operation OperationName (supportQualifier)\" *shall be applied.*

*If the interface is related to notification(s), the next Y.b.a
\"*Notification NotificationName (supportQualifier)\" *below shall be
applied.*

Y6.b.a Operation OperationName (supportQualifier)

*OperationName is the name of the operation followed by a qualifier
indicating whether the operation is Mandatory (M), Optional (O),
Conditional-Mandatory (CM), Conditional-Optional (CO), or SS-Conditional
(C).*

*\"a\" represents a number, starting at 1 and increasing by 1 with each
new definition of an operation.*

Y6.b.a.1 Definition

*This subclause is written in natural language.*

*Information on traceability back to one or more requirements supported
by this operation should* also be defined here, in the following form:

  ----------------------- ------------------- --------------------------
  Referenced TS           Requirement label   Comment
  3GPP TS 32.xyz \[xy\]   REQ-SM-CON-23       *Optional clarification*
  3GPP TS 32.xyz \[xy\]   REQ-SM-FUN-11       *Optional clarification*
  ----------------------- ------------------- --------------------------

Y6.b.a.2 Input parameters

*List of input parameters of the operation. Each element is a tuple
(Parameter Name, Support Qualifier, Information Type (see \[6\] and Note
1) and an optional list of Legal Values supported by the parameter,
Comment). Legal Values for the Support Qualifier are: Mandatory (M),
Optional (O), Conditional-Mandatory (CM), Conditional-Optional (CO), or
SS-Conditional (C).*

This information is provided in a table. An example of such a table is
given here below:

  ---------------- ------------------- --------------------------------- -------------------------------
  Parameter Name   Support Qualifier   Information Type / Legal Values   Comment
  eventIdList      M                   SET OF INTEGER / \--              One or more event identifiers
  ---------------- ------------------- --------------------------------- -------------------------------

Note 1: Information Type qualifies the parameter of Parameter Name. In
the case where the Legal Values can be enumerated, each element is a
pair (Legal Value Name, Legal Value Semantics), unless a Legal Value
Semantics applies to several values in which case the definition is
provided only once. When the Legal Values cannot be enumerated, the list
of Legal Values is defined by a single definition.

Y6.b.a.3 Output parameters

*List of output parameters of the operation. Each element is a tuple
(Parameter Name, Support Qualifier, Matching Information / Information
Type (see \[6\]) (Note 1) and an optional list of Legal Values supported
by the parameter, Comment). Legal Values for the Support Qualifier are:
Mandatory (M), Optional (O), Conditional-Mandatory (CM),
Conditional-Optional (CO), or SS-Conditional (C).*

This information is provided in a table. An example of such a table is
given here below:

+----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+
| Parameter Name | Support        | Matching       | Comment        |
|                | Qualifier      | Information /  |                |

+----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+

Note 1: Information Type qualifies the parameter of Parameter Name. In
the case where the Legal Values can be enumerated, each element is a
pair (Legal Value Name, Legal Value Semantics), unless a Legal Value
Semantics applies to several values in which case the definition is
provided only once. When the Legal Values cannot be enumerated, the list
of Legal Values is defined by a single definition.

*This table shall also include a special parameter 'status' to indicate
the completion status of the operation (success, partial success,
failure reason etc.).*

Y6.b.a.4 Pre-condition

*A pre-condition is a collection of assertions joined by AND, OR, and
NOT logical operators. The pre-condition must be held to be true before
the operation is invoked. An example is given here below:*

*notificationCategoriesNotAllSubscribed OR
notificationCategoriesParameterAbsentAndNotAllSubscribed*

*Each* assertion is defined by a pair (propertyName,
propertyDefinition). All assertions constituting the pre-condition are
provided in a table. An example of such a table is given here below:

  ---------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Assertion Name                                             Definition
  notificationCategoriesNotAllSubscribed                     At least one notificationCategory identified in the notificationCategories input parameter is supported by IRPAgent and is not a member of the ntfNotificationCategorySet attribute of an NtfSubscription which is involved in a subscription relationship with the NtfSubscriber identified by the managerReference input parameter.
  notificationCategoriesParameterAbsentAndNotAllSubscribed   The notificationCategories input parameter is absent and at least one notificationCategory supported by IRPAgent is not a member of the ntfNotificationCategorySet attribute of an ntfSsubscription which is involved in a subscription relationship with the NtfSubscriber identified by the managerReference input parameter.
  ---------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Y6.b.a.5 Post-condition

*A post-condition is a collection of assertions joined by AND, OR, and
NOT logical operators. The post-condition must be held to be true after
the completion of the operation. When nothing is said in a
post-condition regarding an information entity, the assumption is that
this information entity has not changed compared to what is stated in
the\
pre-condition. An example is given here below:*

*subscriptionDeleted OR allSubscriptionDeleted*

*Each assertion is defined by a pair (propertyName, propertyDefinition).
All assertions constituting the post-condit*ion are provided in a table.
An example of such a table is given here below:

  ------------------------ -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Assertion Name           Definition
  subscriptionDeleted      The ntfSubscription identified by subscriptionId input parameter is no more involved in a subscription relationship with the ntfSubscriber identified by the managerReference input parameter and has been deleted. If this ntfSubscriber has no more ntfSubscription, it is deleted as well.
  allSubscriptionDeleted   In the case subscriptionId input parameter was absent, the ntfSubscriber identified by the managerReference input parameter is no more involved in any subscription relationship and is deleted, the corresponding ntfSubscription have been deleted as well.
  ------------------------ -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Y6.b.a.6 Exceptions

*List of exceptions that can be raised by the operation. Each element is
a tuple (exceptionName, condition, ReturnedInformation, exitState).*

Y6.b.a.6.c exceptionName

*ExceptionName is the name of an exception.*

*\"c\" represents a number, starting at 1 and increasing by 1 with each
new definition of an exception.*

*This* information is provided in a table. An example of such a table is
given here below:

Y6.b.a.7 Constraints

*This subclause presents constraints for the operation or its
parameters.*

*This subclause does not need to be present when there are no
constraints to define.*

Y6.b.a Notification NotificationName (supportQualifier)

*NotificationName is the name of the notification followed by a
qualifier indicating whether the notification is Mandatory (M), Optional
(O), Conditional-Mandatory (CM), Conditional-Optional (CO) or
SS-Conditional (C).*

*\"a\" represents a number, starting at 1 and increasing by 1 with each
new definition of a notification.*

Y6.b.a.1 Definition

*This subclause is written in natural language.*

*Information on traceability back to one or more requirements supported
by this notification should* also be defined here, in the following
form:

  ----------------------- ------------------- --------------------------

Y6.b.a.2 Input parameters

*List of input parameters of the notification. Each element is a tuple
(Parameter Name, Qualifiers, Matching Information / Information Type
(see \[6\]) (Note 1) and an optional list of Legal Values supported by
the parameter, Comment).*

*The column \"Qualifiers\" contains the two qualifiers, Support
Qualifier and Filtering Qualifier, separated by a comma. The Support
Qualifier indicates whether the attribute is Mandatory (M), Optional
(O), Conditional-Mandatory (CM), Conditional-Optional (CO), or
SS-Conditional (C). The Filtering Qualifier indicates whether the
parameter of the notification can be filtered or not. Values are Yes (Y)

of Legal Values is defined by a single definition.

Y6.b.a.3 Triggering event

*The triggering event for the notification to be sent is the transition
from the information state defined by the \"from state\" subclause to
the information state defined by the \"to state\" subclause.*

Y6.b.a.3.1 From state

*This subclause is a collection of assertions joined by AND, OR, and NOT
logical operators. An example is given here below:*

*alarmMatched AND alarmInformationNotCleared*

*Each assertion is defined by a pair (propertyName, propertyDefinition).
All assertions constituting the state \"from state\" are provided in a
table. An example of such a table is given here below:*

  ---------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Assertion Name               Definition
  alarmMatched                 The matching-criteria-attributes of the newly generated network alarm has values that are identical (matches) with ones in one AlarmInformation in AlarmList..
  alarmInformationNotCleared   The perceivedSeverity of the newly generated network alarm is not Cleared.
  ---------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Y6.b.a.3.2 To state

*This subclause is a collection of assertions joined by AND, OR and NOT
logical operators. When nothing is said in a to-state regarding an
information entity, the assumption is that this information entity has
not changed compared to what is stated in the from-state. An example is
given here below:*

*resetAcknowledgementInformation AND perceivedSeverityUpdated*

*Each assertion is defined by a pair (propertyName, propertyDefinition).
All assertions constituting the state \"to state\" are provided in a
