Foreword

This Technical Report has been produced by the 3^rd^ Generation
Partnership Project (3GPP).

The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work
within the TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the
TSG modify the contents of the present document, it will be re-released
by the TSG with an identifying change of release date and an increase in
version number as follows:

Version x.y.z

where:

x the first digit:

1 presented to TSG for information;

2 presented to TSG for approval;

3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.

enhanced Node B Subsystem (HeNS)

The present document is part of a set of specifications, which describe
the requirements and information model necessary for the standardised
Operation, Administration and Maintenance (OA&M) of a multi-vendor HNS.

During the lifetime of HNS, its logical and physical configuration will
undergo changes of varying degrees and frequencies in order to optimise
the utilisation of the network resources. These changes will be executed
through network configuration management activities and/or network
engineering, see 3GPP TS 32.600 \[1\].

Many of the activities involved in the daily operation and future
network planning of HNS require data on which to base decisions. This
data refers to the load carried by the network and the grade of service
offered. In order to produce this data performance measurements are
executed in the NEs, which comprise the network. The data can then be
transferred to an external system, e.g. an Operations System (OS) in TMN
terminology, for further evaluation. The purpose of the present document
is to describe the mechanisms involved in the collection of the data and
the definition of the data itself.

Annex B of TS 32.404 \[2\] helps in the definition of new performance
measurements that can be submitted to 3GPP for potential adoption and
inclusion in the present document. Annex B of TS 32.404 discusses a
top-down performance measurement definition methodology that focuses on
how the end-user of performance measurements can use the measurements.

1 Scope
=======

The present document describes the measurements for Home Node B
subsystem (HNS).\
HNS \[3\] is consists of a HNB and HNB-GW. And, it appears as an RNS to
the core network and is connected by means of the Iu-CS interface to the
MSC and by means of the Iu-PS interface to the SGSN.\
TS 32.401 \[4\] describes Performance Management concepts and
requirements.\
The present document is valid for all measurement types provided by an
implementation of a HNS.\
Only measurement types that are specific to HNS are defined within the
present documents. Vendor specific measurement types used in HNS are not
covered. Instead, these could be applied according to manufacturer\'s
documentation.

Measurements related to \"external\" technologies (such as ATM or IP) as
described by \"external\" standards bodies (e.g. ITU-T or IETF) shall
only be referenced within this specification, wherever there is a need
identified for the existence of such a reference.

The definition of the standard measurements is intended to result in
comparability of measurement data produced in a multi-vendor network,
for those measurement types that can be standardised across all
vendors\' implementations.

The structure of the present document is as follows:

\- Header 1: Network Element (e.g. measurements related to HNB and HNB
GW);

\- Header 2: Measurement function (e.g. HNB registration measurements);

\- Header 3: Measurements.

4 Functionality related measurements
====================================

The measurements defined in this clause are related to the functionality
aspect performance. The detailed measurements for each function are
defined in the following subclauses.

4.1 Measurements related to HNB-GW
==================================

### 4.1.1 UE registration/de-registration related measurements

#### 4.1.1.1 Overview

The UE Registration procedure provides means for the HNB to convey UE
identification data to the HNB-GW in order to perform access control for
the UE in the HNB-GW. The UE Registration also establishes a UE specific
context identifier to be used between HNB and HNB-GW. The procedure
triggered when the UE attempts to access the HNB via an initial NAS
message and there is no context in the HNB allocated for that UE. The
successful UE registration rate thus poses an important impact on the
QoE which accessing the HNB networks from a macro view on the OA&M
basis.

The de-registration procedure may be originated by either HNB or HNB GW.

Performance Measurement definitions in this subclause are based on 3GPP
TS 25.469 \[5\].

The following paragraphs are of interest for this purpose:

\- UE REGISTER REQUEST

\- UE REGISTER ACCEPT

\- UE REGISTER REJECT

\- UE DE-REGISTER

These paragraphs show in particular the following diagrams:

######### Annex A: Use cases for performance measurements definition

The present annex provides the concrete use cases for the HNS
performance measurements defined in clause 4.

A.1 Use case of registration and de-registration measurements
=============================================================

UE registration is one of most important step to start delivering
services by the HNS to users.

The success or failure of a registration directly impacts the quality
level for delivering the service by the networks, and also user's
experience. So the success or failure of registration needs be
monitored, this can be achieved by the calculation of registration setup
success rate which gives a direct view to evaluate the user's access to
the network and analyze the specific reason causing the failure in order
to find out the problem and ascertain the solutions.

In addition, de-registration is another sort of indicator to guarantee
user QoS level. In the case of radio resource and transport resource
shortage, HNB or HNB-GW could initiates a de-registration requests. The
collections of de-registration would help to evaluate network deployment
states. Depending on these parameters meaning, network optimizations
could be implemented. This can be achieved by identifying the specific
reason and splitting into sub-subcounters per cause. These parameters
give a direct view to evaluate network states.

A.2 Use case of the SCTP signalling measurements
================================================

In order to avoid the overload of HNB-GW, SCTP signaling measurements
data will be combined with HNB-GW user plane measurement data to reflect
load status on HNB-GW.

In addition, the ratio of signaling to data bandwidth usage is very
useful to monitor some abnormal events, such as if the ratio of them is
too high, some unusual events are possible happened. Therefore, the
operator could analyze whether some problems exist in the network or
not, and may find out root-causes leaded to the bad conditions, finally
resolve the problems.

A.3 Use case of HNB registration and de-registration measurements
=================================================================

HNB registration and de-registration are most important step to start or
cease delivering services by the networks to users.

The successful and failed HNB registration rate can reflect Iuh link
status between HNB and HNB-GW. It could be used to evaluate an
operational quality for operators. Especially, HNB uses a leased
backhaul to connect to HNB-GW. A successful HNB registration rate could
be treated as a key performance indicator to offer to users who signed
SLA with operators. A failed HNB registration could be aroused by
several causes, such network congestion, blacklisted HNB, unauthorized
HNB location, etc. The monitor of failed reason could facilitate
trouble-shooting. Operator can determine root-causes depending on the
feedback. In addition, an operational optimization can be performed in
the specific area, where HNBs using similar LAC are often failed to get
service.

HNB-GW originated de-registration will be performed whenever HNB-GW
needs to terminate operations with an HNB. The specific causes can be
extracted from the signalling HNB DE-REGISTER, such as overload and
unspecified. In the case of overload, it can accurately reflect HNB-GW
load status. And, operators could implement further measures to avoid
potential failures when specific HNB-GW often initiates de-registration
process with the cause of overload.

A.4 Use case of HNB-GW user plane measurements
==============================================

HNB-GW user plane related measurements are used to measure data volume
on Iuh interface including incoming and outgoing of data packets and
octets for RTP and GTP-U.

Based on that, the measurements are useful to analyze data volumes and
velocity from HNB-GW point-of-view. If the data volume is too high, more
interface bandwidth should be deployed, or HNB-GW load balance should be
considered. If data velocity is too high, the packet forwarding capacity
of HNB-GW should be enhanced to avoid data congestion.

In addition, differentiating user plane statistics on PS and CS domain
can allow operators to monitor respective data volume for different
service type. Furthermore, it can also reflect the load status on Iucs
and Iups interfaces, on which performance evaluations will benefit from
distinguished data stream monitoring

Finally, HNB-GW user plane related measurements could be together with
other performance measurements to analyze network performance to find
out the abnormal events.

A.5 RAB related performance
===========================

RAB management procedure includes RAB Assignment procedure and RAB
Release Request procedure. The purpose of RAB Assignment procedure is to
establish new RABs and releases of already established RABs for a given
UE. If RABs are failed to be established, the involved services may
fail. RAB release request can be initiated HNB when the services
terminate normally or abnormally.

During daily maintenance of network, measurements regarding RAB
establishment and release are useful for operators to evaluate RAB
management procedures, to analyze failure reasons of RAB establishment
and to analyze the causes of RAB release, especially in case RAB release
abnormally.

Based on that, these measurements are useful for drawing connection rate
and drop rate of Femto system for both CS and PS domain. Both rates
reflect connectivity and continuity for system services, which are the
direct key performance indicators of user experience. Operators can
analyse these indicators and acknowledge network quality and user
experience better.

A.6 Faulty transport blocks related performance
===============================================

This measurement family is used to measure the number of received uplink
transport blocks of DCH and uplink faulty transport blocks of DCH.

Based on that, the measurements are useful to analyze uplink transport
block error rate from HNB point-of-view. If the block error rate is too
high, it indicates a bad channel environment, and a handover or
low-level modulation may be needed. In addition, differentiating
transport block error rate on PS and CS domain can allow operators to
monitor respective for different service type.

Finally, faulty transport blocks related measurements could be together
with other performance measurements to analyze network performance to
find out the abnormal events.

A.7 CSG service related performance
===================================

A Closed Subscriber Group identifies subscribers of an operator who are
permitted to access one or more PLMN cells which have restricted access.
It is a new added feature in HNB to facilitate the provisioning of new
service.

By calculating these parameters relating to CSG service, the operator
can obtain the mean number of CSG UEs and the successful rate of inbound
mobility for UEs. The mean number of CSG UEs indicates how many users
accessing the CSG service, which is a key performance for service
utilization. The successful rate of inbound mobility for UEs performs a
key indicator of CSG service accessibility. As low handover success rate
will impact user experience, it is important to define measurements to
capture handover success rate. Furthermore, detailed analysis of
handover failures is essential to know what causes the handovers.

Based on these indicators, the operator can optimize the service
coverage and enhance the user experience.

A.8 LIPA related performance
============================

The direct user plane path between the HNB and the collocated L-GW is
enabled with a Correlation ID parameter that is associated with the
default bearer on a PDP connection used for Local IP Access. Upon
establishment of the default bearer the SGSN sets the Correlation ID the
user plane GGSN TEID that the Gn-SGSN has received or the user plane PDN
GW TEID that the S4-SGSN has received. The Correlation ID is then
signalled by the SGSN to the HNB as part of RAB establishment and is
stored in the RAB context in the HNB. The Correlation ID is used in the
HNB for matching the radio bearers with the direct user plane path
connections from the collocated L-GW.

Measurements regarding RABs corresponding to direct user plane path
between HNB and LGW are useful for operators to evaluate the performance
of RAB procedures. When users have problems with LIPA services,
operators could analyze the reasons through these measurements.
