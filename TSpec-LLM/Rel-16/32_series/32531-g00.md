3 Definitions and abbreviations
===============================

For the purposes of the present document, the terms and definitions
given in TS 32.101 \[2\], TS 32.102 \[3\] and TS 21.905 \[1\] and the
following apply. A term defined in the present document takes precedence
over the definition of the same term, if any, in TS 32.101 \[2\], TS
32.102 \[3\] and TS 21.905 \[1\], in that order.

3.1 Definitions
---------------

For the purposes of the present document, the terms and definitions
given in TR 21.905 \[1\] and the following apply. A term defined in the
present document takes precedence over the definition of the same term,
if any, in TR 21.905 \[1\].

**Software Management:** Activities to control which software is
available and/or active in a network element.

**Automated Software Management:** Software Management which is
performed without the presence of an IRPManager (SWM). An IRPManager may
monitor and /or control the software management activities. An IRPAgent\
receives information to perform the Software Management activities in an
autonomous way.\
\
**Non-Automated Software Management:** Software Management which
requires the presence of IRPManager (SWM) to fully control and monitor
the software management activities. The IRPAgent receives explicit
instructions from the IRPManager about the SW Management activities
which shall be performed.

**Software Installation:** Installation of software puts it into a form
suitable for activation or use.

**Software Activation**: Activation of software makes it ready to be
used and the software starts providing service.

3.2 Abbreviations
-----------------

For the purposes of the present document, the abbreviations given in
TR 21.905 \[1\] and the following apply. An abbreviation defined in the
present document takes precedence over the definition of the same
abbreviation, if any, in TR 21.905 \[1\].

FFS

### 4.2.2 Specification level requirement on Automated SWM

**REQ\_ASWM\_FUN\_1\
**It shall be possible for an IRPManager to retrieve

\- information regarding how an NE or a group of NEs behaves during
ASWM, i.e. in which sequence the essential steps of ASWM are executed

\- information regarding where the IRPManager can interact with ASWM -
by suspending the ASWM process at one or more ASWM stop points.\
Steps, their sequence and their stop point qualification are not imposed
by the standard.

**REQ\_ASWM\_FUN\_2\
**If choices for stop points to suspend the SWM process are offered,
then it shall be possible for an IRPManager to choose/select among them
where it will suspend (stop) a SWM process (i.e. to ensure fulfillment
of pre-conditions for the step like the fulfillment of the presence of
required input data for the step).

The IRPManager shall be able to read or select or de-select the stop
points offered.

The IRPManager shall be informed about the availability of new SW, about
the creation and deletion of a profile which is a holder of information
regarding the offered SWM steps, the offered sequence of the steps and
the configuration steps stop points.

The IRPManager should be able to change the content of a created profile
and be informed about the change.

**REQ\_ASWM\_FUN\_3\
**It shall be possible for an IRPManager to resume a suspended ASWM
process.

**REQ\_ASWM\_FUN\_4\
**It shall be possible for IRPManager to retrieve information about the
progress of ASWM.

**REQ\_ASWM\_FUN\_5\
**The IRPAgent should send a notification when the ASWM process

-   was suspended

-   was resumed

-   was terminated

**REQ\_ASWM\_FUN\_6**

It shall be possible for an IRPManager to terminate a currently ongoing
ASWM process for one or multiple NEs. After a termination it is not
possible to resume the ASWM process.

**REQ\_ASWM\_FUN\_7**

In order to declare the SW activation succeeded, a self test should have
been completed.

**REQ\_ASWM\_FUN\_8**

If the software activation fails, information documenting the reasons
for the failure should be logged, to support the trouble shooting.

### 4.2.3 Specification level requirement on Non-Automated SWM

**REQ\_NASWM\_FUN\_1**

**It shall be possible for an IRPManager to request to download software
units to one or multiple network elements. A notification shall be
generated at the end of download operation for both success and failure
scenarios. The notification may optionally contain specific error
conditions (e.g. insufficient disk space, communication error etc.) in
case of failures.**

**REQ\_NASWM\_FUN\_2**

**The IRPAgent should support a capability for the IRPManager to request
the IRPAgent to cancel an ongoing download operation to one or multiple
network elements. If download is not complete, software units that had
been downloaded between the time download operation was invoked and the
time when download operation was cancelled shall be deleted.**

**REQ\_NASWM\_FUN\_3**

**It may be possible for an IRPManager to initiate installation of NE
software to one or multiple network elements. A notification shall be
generated at the end of installation operation for both success and
failure scenarios. The notification may optionally contain specific
error conditions in case of failures.**

**REQ\_NASWM\_FUN\_4**

**The IRPAgent should support a capability for the IRPManager to request
the IRPAgent to cancel an ongoing installation process to one or
multiple network elements. If an install operation is cancelled by
IRPManager before it is complete, software units that had been installed
between the time install operation was invoked and the time when install
operation was cancelled shall be uninstalled.**

**REQ\_NASWM\_FUN\_5**

**It shall be possible for an IRPManager to activate NE software for one
or multiple network elements. A notification shall be generated at the
end of activation operation for both success and failure scenarios. The
notification may optionally contain specific error conditions in case of
failures.**

**REQ\_NASWM\_FUN\_6**

**IRPManager shall be able to invoke fallback operation for one or
multiple network elements after software installation or after software
activation to fallback to a configuration it was in prior to software
installation or software activation respectively.**

**REQ\_NASWM\_FUN\_7**

It shall be possible for IRPManager to retrieve information about the
progress of NASWM.

**REQ\_NASWM\_FUN\_8**

**The IRPAgent should support a capability for the IRPManager to cancel
an ongoing activation process to one or multiple network elements. If an
activation operation is cancelled by IRPManager before it is complete,
software units that had been not been activated between the time
activation operation was invoked and the time when activation operation
was cancelled shall be** ready for later retry of activation**.**
