Foreword
========

This Technical Specification (TS) has been produced by the 3^rd^
Generation Partnership Project (3GPP).

The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work
within the TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the
TSG modify the contents of the present document, it will be re-released
by the TSG with an identifying change of release date and an increase in
version number as follows:

Version x.y.z

where:

x the first digit:

1 presented to TSG for information;

2 presented to TSG for approval;

3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.

y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e.
technical enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.

z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been
incorporated in the document.

Introduction
============

The present document is part of a TS-family covering the 3rd Generation
Partnership Project; Technical Specification Group Services and System
Aspects; Telecommunication management; Test management Integration
Reference Point (IRP), as identified below:

32.321: \"Test management Integration Reference Point (IRP);
Requirements\"

**32.322: \"Test management Integration Reference Point (IRP):
Information Service (IS)\"**

32.326: \"Test management Integration Reference Point (IRP): Solution
Set (SS) definitions\"

A 3G telecommunication network is composed of a multitude of different
Network Elements (NE). For a successful operation of the network the
operator must be provided with mechanisms allowing him to manage the
network. These management activities can be grouped into several areas:
configuration management, fault management, performance management,
accounting management and security management.

A management function assisting in different high level management areas
such as fault management and performance management is test management.
The purpose of testing is to get information about the functionality and
performance of the 3G managed network subject to the test.

The present document is part of a TS-family defining the
Telecommunication Management (TM) of 3G systems.\
The TM principles are described in 3GPP TS 32.101 \[5\]. The TM
architecture is described in 3GPP TS 32.102 \[6\].\
The other specifications define the interface (Itf-N) between the
managing system (manager), which is in general the Network Manager (NM)
and the managed system (agent), which is either an Element Manager (EM)
or the managed NE itself. The Itf-N is composed of a number of
integration reference points (IRPs) defining the information in the
agent that is visible for the manager, the operations that the manager
may perform on this information and the notifications that are sent from
the agent to the manager. One of these IRPs is the Test Management IRP.

Each IRP is specified by the requirements part, the IS part and at least
one SS (e.g. CORBA SS).

1 Scope
=======

The present document defines the IS part of the Test Management IRP,
which describes the semantics of the information and the interactions
visible across Itf-N in a protocol independent way. The information is
specified by means of information object classes and the interactions by
means of operations and notifications. The present document does not
specify the syntax (encoding) of the information.

2 References
============

The following documents contain provisions which, through reference in
this text, constitute provisions of the present document.

\- References are either specific (identified by date of publication,
edition number, version number, etc.) or non‑specific.

\- For a specific reference, subsequent revisions do not apply.

\- For a non-specific reference, the latest version applies. In the case
of a reference to a 3GPP document (including a GSM document), a
non-specific reference implicitly refers to the latest version of that
document *in the same Release as the present document*.

### 5.2.1 Attributes and Relationships

The following figure shows, for the Test Management IRP, the class
definitions and the relationships between the classes.

From the cardinalities can be seen that each instance of
*TestManagementIRP* may have several instances of *TestActionPerformer*.
Each instance of *TestActionPerformer* can have multiple instances of
associated *TesterObjects*. Each instance of *TesterObject* in turn has
one instance of *TestInvocation*. For the resource self test, each
instance of TesterObject has one instance of MORT. For the connection
and loopback test, each instance of TesterObject has two instances of
MORT.

### 5.2.2 Inheritance

The following figure depicts the inheritance relationships between the
information object classes.

5.3 Information Object Classes (IOCs) definition
------------------------------------------------

### 5.3.1 Information Object Class *TestManagementIRP*

#### 5.3.1.1 Definition

The IOC *TestManagementIRP* together with the IOC *TestActionPerformer*
represent the test management capabilities defined by this
specification. To conduct a test of network resources, this object may
require capabilities of other objects such as *TesterObject*. The IOC
*TestManagementIRP* inherits from the IOC *ManagedGenericIRP* specified
in TS 32.312 \[2\].

#### 5.3.1.2 Attributes

The IOC *TestManagementIRP* has no own attributes, only those inherited
from the IOC *ManagedGenericIRP*.

### 5.3.2 Information Object Class *TestActionPerformer*

#### 5.3.2.1 Definition

The IOC *TestActionPerformer* provides the ability to receive and react
upon test requests. This class must also be able to instantiate and
delete tester objects or, in case the tester objects are permanently
instantiated, to allocate and reserve them for their usage. This
specification does not require this IOC to be instantiated. It may be
abstract and used for inheritance purposes only. In this way the ability
to receive and react upon test requests may be included in any other
IOC.

### 5.3.3 Information Object Class *TesterObject*

#### 5.3.3.1 Definition

The IOC *TesterObject* monitors and controls the testing of a *MORT*
instance and reports the outcome of the test execution. Tester Objects
(TOs) are instantiated by the IOC *TestActionPerformer* in response to a
valid test initiation request (*initiateTests*). They are deleted after
termination of the test. It is also possible that TOs are permanently
instantiated. In this case they are allocated to a certain
*TestActionPerformer* during the test execution. After termination of
the test they are released.

The IOC *TesterObject* defines a generic TO. It shall be used as an
abstract class from which more specific tester objects shall be derived
by specialisation for each test category. Test categories and the
associated test category specific TOs are defined in ITU-T
Recommendation X.737 \[10\]. These test category specific TOs can be
specialised further by defining Vendor-Specific-Extended (VSE) TOs. The
generic TO defines attributes pertaining to a test and required for all
test categories.

Each test invocation shall have only one associated TO.

Only test category specific TOs or VSE TOs shall be instantiated.

For simplicity this specification will often use only the term TO. In
this case either the test category specific TO or the VSE TO is referred
to depending on which is actually instantiated.

### 5.3.4 Information Object Class *ResourceSelfTestTesterObject*

#### 5.3.4.1 Definition

The IOC *ResourceSelfTesterObject* is a specialised TO for the resource
self test. It inherits from the IOC *TesterObject.* It specifies the
triggering events for the emission of the test result notifications.

#### 5.3.4.2 Attributes

This IOC has no own attributes, only those inherited from the generic
IOC *TesterObject*.

### 5.3.5 Proxy Class VSETestCategoryTesterObject

#### 5.3.5.1 Definition

Certain tests may not fit in any of the test categories defined in ITU-T
Recommendation X.737 \[10\]. In this case vendors may define new (VSE)
test categories and the associated test category specific TOs. The Proxy
Class *VSETestCategoryTesterObject* represents the set of these VSE test
category tester objects

The IOCs represented by the Proxy Class *VSETestCategoryTesterObject*
shall inherit from the IOC *TesterObject*.

NOTE: A vendor may also claim 3GPP compliance to a certain release in
case that a specific test fits into one of the ITU-T test categories
without that the corresponding ITU-T test category specific TO is
supported in this release supposed that this test category specific TO
will be added in a later release than the current one. The vendor shall
update this specification in due time.

#### 5.3.5.2 Attributes

The attributes of this IOC are vendor specific.

### 5.3.6 Proxy Class VSEResourceSelfTestTesterObject

#### 5.3.6.1 Definition

In case the IOC *ResourceSelfTestTesterObject* does not fulfil the
specific requirements of a certain resource self test, vendors may
define proprietary IOCs by further specialisation. The Proxy Class
*VSEResourceSelfTestTesterObject* represents these IOCs.

The IOCs represented by the Proxy Class
*VSEResourceSelfTestTesterObject* shall inherit from the IOC
*ResourceSelfTestTesterObject*.

#### 5.3.6.2 Attributes

Apart from the attributes inherited the attributes of the IOCs
represented by this Proxy Class are vendor specific.

### 5.3.7 Proxy Class *VSETesterObject*

#### 5.3.7.1 Definition

In case an IOC represented by the Proxy Class
*VSETestCategoryTesterObject* does not fulfil the specific requirements
of a certain test, vendors may define proprietary IOCs by further
specialisation. The Proxy Class *VSETesterObject* represents these IOCs.

The IOCs represented by the Proxy Class *VSETesterObject* shall inherit
from the associated IOC represented by the Proxy Class
*VSETestCategoryTesterObject*.

#### 5.3.7.2 Attributes

Apart from the attributes inherited the attributes of the IOCs
represented by this Proxy Class are vendor specific.

### 5.3.8 Proxy Class *MORT*

#### 5.3.8.1 Definition

The ProxyClass *MORT* represents a network resource that is under test.
Its class definition shall be one defined in the various 3GPP Network
Resource Model specifications or defined by a VSE network resource
class.

#### 5.3.8.2 Attributes

This IOC has no attributes.

### 5.3.9 Information Object Class *TestInvocation*

#### 5.3.9.1 Definition

The IOC *TestInvocation* is the abstract representation of a test
invocation. A test invocation shall aim to test one or more capabilities
of a MORT. The IRPManager can request for the establishment of a test
invocation using the operation *initiateTests*.

A MORT can be complex in that there are multiple capabilities that can
be subject to test. Therefore, it is possible to have multiple test
activities active, all aimed at the same MORT but on its different
capabilities. Whether multiple test activities can be testing the same
MORT capabilities at the same time is an implementation decision,
probably based on the nature and behaviour of the TO, and therefore, is
outside the scope of this specification.

6 Interface definition
======================

6.1 Class diagram representing interfaces
-----------------------------------------

The following diagram depicts the interfaces of the Test Management IRP
with their corresponding operations and notifications.

6.2 Generic rules
-----------------

**Rule 1:** Each operation with at least one input parameter supports a
pre-condition valid\_input\_parameter which indicates that all input
parameters shall be valid with regards to their information type.
Additionally, each such operation supports an exception
operation\_failed\_invalid\_input\_parameter which is raised when
pre-condition valid\_input\_parameter is false. The exception has the
same entry and exit state.

**Rule 2:** Each operation with at least one optional input parameter
supports a set of pre-conditions
supported\_optional\_input\_parameter\_xxx where \"xxx\" is the name of
the optional input parameter and the pre‑condition indicates that the
operation supports the named optional input parameter. Additionally,
each such operation supports an exception
operation\_failed\_unsupported\_optional\_input\_parameter\_xxx which is
raised when (a) the pre-condition
supported\_optional\_input\_parameter\_xxx is false and (b) the named
optional input parameter is carrying information. The exception has the
same entry and exit state.

**Rule 3:** Each operation shall support a generic exception
operation\_failed\_internal\_problem that is raised when an internal
problem occurs and that the operation cannot be completed. The exception
has the same entry and exit state.

6.3 Interface testManagementIRPControlOperations
------------------------------------------------

The interface *TestManagementIRPControlOperations* contains the
operations *initiateTests* and *terminateTests*. It must be implemented
by every object with the ability to receive and react upon test
requests, for example by every instance of *TestActionPerformer*.

### 6.3.1 Operation *initiateTests* (M)

#### 6.3.1.1 Definition

The IRPManager uses this operation to request the IRPAgent to initiate
controlled tests. A single test request may initiate multiple (one or
more) tests.

For each test to be initiated the managed object representing the
network resource to be tested and the tester object class must be
specified.

The initiated tests are independent and not related to each other. This
implies that independent test result notifications are sent for each of
the tests initiated by s single *initiateTests* operation.

### 6.3.2 Operation *terminateTests* (M)

#### 6.3.2.1 Definition

The IRPManager uses this operation to request the IRPAgent to terminate
tests during their life time. A single *terminateTests* operation may
terminate multiple (one or more) tests.

The tests to be terminated are identified by their test invocation
identifiers. The IRPManager terminating a test may be different from the
IRPManager that initiated the test. The *terminateTests* operation must
be invoked on the object which received the corresponding
*initiateTests* operation.

6.4 Interface TestManagementIRPMonitorOperations
------------------------------------------------

The interface *TestManagementIRPMonitorOperations* contains the
operation *monitorTest*. It has a realisation relationship with the IOC
*TestActionPerformer*.

### 6.4.1 Operation *monitorTest* (M)

#### 6.4.1.1 Definition

IRPManager shall be able to retrieve information about the test as
observed by the TO during the test execution by reading the relevant
attributes of the TO associated to the test. Also after the test
execution the manager shall be able to read these attributes as long as
the TO exists. Attributes conveying information about the test execution
are *testState* and *testOutcome*. Depending on the specific test
category specific TO or the VSE TO other attributes may also contain
information about the test execution. In this case the subject operation
may also allow to read the values of these attributes.

6.5 Interface TestManagementIRPNotifications
--------------------------------------------

### 6.5.1 Notification *notifyTestResults* (M)

#### 6.5.1.1 Definition

Test results are made available to the IRPManager by one or more
notifications *notifyTestResults* emitted by the TO that is related to
the test invocation.

Depending on the nature of the test and the specification of the TO
behaviour, the TO may need to convey to the IRPManager a test result
data set. There are two ways to convey this kind of information. One way
is to use the parameter *additionalInformation* of the notification. In
this case, the *fileReference* and *fileExpiryDate* shall contain no
information or be absent. The other way is to use a file to capture the
test result data set. In this case, the *additionalInformation*
parameter may contain no information or be absent and the
*fileReference* and *fileExpiryDate* shall be present. The file that
captures the test result data set shall contain VSE attributes and other
3GPP attributes such as *testerObjectClass*, *testOutcome*, etc.

The use of the *additionalInformation* parameter or a file to capture
the test result data set is specified by the class specification of the
TO.

In case the TO uses *additionalInformation* (and not a file) to capture
the test result data set, that TO may emit this notification to transfer
intermediate (non-final) test results. In this kind of notifications,
the *testOutcome* parameter shall be absent. The TO should emit at least
one more notification regarding the subject test invocation in the
future. The last notification pertaining to a particular test invocation
shall be indicated by including the *testOutcome* parameter in the
notification.

In the case the TO uses a file to capture the test result data set, that
TO shall not issue any notifications to transfer intermediate test
results. The TO may capture the non-final test results in the file used
to capture the final test result data set.

The events triggering the emission of test result notifications depend
on the specific test. They shall be specified by the TO that is actually
instantiated, i.e. either by the test category specific TO or the VSE
TO. Some generic triggering events are included in this specification.
It is expected that vendors specify more triggering events.

#### 6.5.1.2 Triggering Events for the Test

For the test the events triggering the emission of test result
notifications are:

\- Termination of the test execution.

The test may be terminated explicitly by a test termination request. The
events triggering an implicit termination are:

\- Fulfilment of the conditions for a successful termination of the
test.

\- Fulfilment of the conditions for a premature termination of the test.

\- Occurrence of an error situation.

######## Annex A (informative): Network Performance Measurement Procedure

There are four procedures in network performance measurement:
initiation, termination, monitor and test result report.

In the initiation, NM sends an initiation request in which there are
some configuration parameters to EM with operation *initialTests*. The
EM will store the parameters and send some configuration parameters to
the source NE and destination NE (or the loopback NE) to initiate the
network performance measurement. For the IP network, the network
elements will start the test with the protocols defined in IETF \[12\]
\[13\]. The following figure illustrates the test initialisation
procedure.

Figure A.1 Initiation procedure for Network Performance Measurement

When the NM terminates the test, NM sends a termination request to EM
with operation *terminateTests*. The EM will save and send some
parameters to the source NE and destination NE (or the loopback NE) to
terminate the network performance measurement. The following figure
illustrates the test termination procedure.

Figure A.2 Termination procedure for Network Performance Measurement

When the NM monitors the test, NM sends a monitor request to EM with
operation *monitorTests*. If it is needed, the EM will send request to
the NE(s) to retrieve information before it send back the output
parameters. Then the EM will send back the output parameters to the NM.
The following figure illustrates the test monitor procedure.

Figure A.3 Monitor procedure for Network Performance Measurement

After the test is terminated, the test result is recorded in a test
result file in EM. Then the EM sends a notification *notifyTestResults*
to the NM, in which there is some information for the NM to retrieve the
file. The following figure illustrates the test monitor procedure.
