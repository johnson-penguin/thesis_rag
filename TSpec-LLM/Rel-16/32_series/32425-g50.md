The present document is part of a set of specifications, which describe
the requirements and information model necessary for the standardised
Operation, Administration and Maintenance (OA&M) of a multi-vendor
E-UTRAN and EPC system.

During the lifetime of an E-UTRAN, its logical and physical
configuration will undergo changes of varying degrees and frequencies in
order to optimise the utilisation of the network resources. These
changes will be executed through network configuration management
activities and/or network engineering, see TS 32.600 \[3\].

Many of the activities involved in the daily operation and future
network planning of an E-UTRAN require data on which to base decisions.
This data refers to the load carried by the network and the grade of
service offered. In order to produce this data performance measurements
are executed in the NEs, which comprise the network. The data can then
be transferred to an external system, e.g. an Operations System (OS) in
TMN terminology, for further evaluation. The purpose of the present
document is to describe the mechanisms involved in the collection of the
data and the definition of the data itself.

Annex B of TS 32.404 helps in the definition of new performance
measurements that can be submitted to 3GPP for potential adoption and
inclusion in the present document. Annex B of TS 32.404 discusses a
top-down performance measurement definition methodology that focuses on
how the end-user of performance measurements can use the measurements.

1 Scope
=======

The present document describes the measurements for E-UTRAN.

TS 32.401 \[5\] describes Performance Management concepts and
requirements.

The present document is valid for all measurement types provided by an
implementation of an E-UTRAN.

Only measurement types that are specific to E-UTRAN are defined within
the present documents. Vendor specific measurement types used in E-UTRAN
are not covered. Instead, these could be applied according to
manufacturer\'s documentation.

Measurements related to \"external\" technologies (such as ATM or IP) as
described by \"external\" standards bodies (e.g. ITU-T or IETF) shall
only be referenced within this specification, wherever there is a need
identified for the existence of such a reference.

The definition of the standard measurements is intended to result in
comparability of measurement data produced in a multi-vendor network,
for those measurement types that can be standardised across all
vendors\' implementations.

The structure of the present document is as follows:

\- Header 1: Network Element (e.g. measurements related to eNodeB);

\- Header 2: Measurement function (e.g. RRC connection setup related
measurements);

\- Header 3: Measurements.

2 References
============

The following documents contain provisions which, through reference in
this text, constitute provisions of the present document.

\- References are either specific (identified by date of publication
and/or edition number or version number) or non‑specific.

\- For a specific reference, subsequent revisions do not apply.

\- For a non-specific reference, the latest version applies. In the case
of a reference to a 3GPP document (including a GSM document), a
non-specific reference implicitly refers to the latest version of that
document *in the same Release as the present document*.

    Besides being added to the measurement of total too late handovers,
    each too late handover (identified by the eNB according to the
    definitions in TS 36.300 \[12\]) is also added to the relevant
    subcounter indicating the threshold of the serving cell itself
    configured in the measurement report triggering events (see 36.331
    \[18\]) was not crossed or the threshold of the neighbour cell
    configured in the measurement report triggering events was not
    crossed if more than one threshold triggering a measurement report
    is configured to the UEs for the involved neighbour relation and the
    following UE measurement results are available for both cells
    involved in the too late handover\
    - rsrpResult of "measResultLastServCell" and\
    - rsrpResult of the subject neighbour cell in
    "measResultNeighCells"\
    in\
    a) the "RLF report" IE in the received RRC message
    "UEInformationResponse" (see 36.331 \[18\]), in case both cells
    involved in the too late handover belong to the same eNB,\
    or\
    b) the "UE RLF Report Container" IE in the received X2 message "RLF
    Indication", in case the cells involved in the too late handover
    belong to different eNBs.\
    The uncrossed threshold (of the serving itself and the neighbour) is
    identified by comparing the UE measurement results above with the
    configured thresholds (adding the corresponding hysteresis, see
    36.331 \[18\]) of the measurement report triggering events,\
    - if the threshold of the serving cell itself was not crossed, the
    observed too late handover is then added to the subcounter
    (HO.OutFail.TooLateOwnNotCrossed) indicating the threshold of the
    serving cell was not crossed\
    - if the threshold of the neighbor cell itself was not crossed, the
    observed too late handover is then added to the subcounter
    (HO.OutFail.TooLateNeighborNotCrossed) indicating the threshold of
    the neighbour cell was not crossed\
    - if the thresholds of both the serving cell itself and the
    neighbour cell were not crossed, then this too late handover is
    added to both subcounters (HO.OutFail.TooLateOwnNotCrossed and
    HO.OutFail.TooLateNeighborNotCrossed) indicating the threshold of
    serving cell itself was not crossed and the threshold of the
    neighbour cell was not crossed\
    - if no threshold was not crossed, then this handover is only added
    to the measurement of total too late handovers but not to the
    subcounter indicating the threshold of the serving cell itself was
    not crossed or the threshold of the neighbour cell was not crossed.\
    If only one threshold triggring the measurement report is configured
    to the UEs for the involved neighbour relation or the UE
    measurements above are not available, the observed too late handover
    is only added to the measurement of total too late handovers but not
    to the subcounter indicating the threshold of the serving cell
    itself was not crossed or the threshold of the neighbour cell was
    not crossed.

######## Annex A (informative): Use cases for performance measurements defintion

A.0 Introduction
================

This annex provides the concrete use cases for the E-UTRAN performance
measurements defined in clause 4.

Without particular constraint, the following use cases defined for
eNodeB apply to following scenarios

1)  eNodeB serving one or more Relay Nodes

2)  eNodeB without serving any Relay Node

3)  eNodeB or Relay Node supporting Carrier Aggregation

4)  eNodeB or Relay Node not supporting Carrier Aggregation

If the specific constraint is present, which one of the above scenarios
the subject use case applies to, is following the constraint.

A.1 Monitor of call(/session) setup performance
===============================================

Call(/session) setup is one of most important step to start delivering
services by the networks to users.

The success or failure of a call(/session) setup directly impacts the
quality level for delivering the service by the networks, and also the
feeling of the end user. So the success or failure of call(/session)
setup needs be monitored, this can be achieved by the calculation of
call setup success rate which gives a direct view to evaluate the call
setup performance, and the analysis of the specific reason causing the
failure to find out the problem and ascertain the solutions.

In addition, the time duration of the call(/session) setup need to be
monitored as it impacts the end user experience, and by comparison with
operator's benchmark requirements, the optimization may be required
according the performance.

And due to different priority and tolerance for different service type
with different OoS level in the networks, the monitor needs to be opened
on each service type and OoS level.

To complete the call(/session) setup procedure, E-UTRAN is mainly
responsible for the establishment of radio and S1 signaling connection
and service bearer by the RRC connection establishment (See 3GPP TS
36.331\[8\]), RRC connection reestablishment after RRC connection
dropped due to some reasons like radio link failure or handover failure
etc (See 3GPP TS 36.331\[8\]) E-RAB setup (See 3GPP TS 36.413\[9\]) and
Initial UE Context Setup (See 3GPP TS 36.413\[9\]) procedure.

To support the monitor of success or failure of the call(/session)
setup, the performance measurements related to RRC connection
establishment (See 3GPP TS 36.331\[8\]), RRC connection reestablishment
(See 3GPP TS 36.331\[8\]) procedure, and the performance measurements
related to E-RAB setup (See 3GPP TS 36.413\[9\]) and Initial UE Context
Setup (See 3GPP TS 36.413\[9\]) procedure for each QoS level are
required To support the monitor of time duration of setup call(/session)
setup, the performance measurements related to RRC connection setup time
and E-RAB setup time are required.

A.2 Monitoring of E-RAB release
===============================

E-RAB is the key and limited resource for E-UTRAN to deliver services.
The release of the E-RAB needs to be monitored as:

\- an abnormal release of the E-RAB will cause the call(/session) drop,
which directly impacts the QoS delivered by the networks, and the
satisfaction degree of the end user;

\- a successfully released E-RAB can be used to setup other requested
calls(/sessions). The E-RAB failed to be released will still occupy the
limited resource and hence it can not be used to admit other requested
calls(/sessions).

However, the abnormal release of the E-RAB has potential scenario where,
regardless of receiving the UE Context Release Command with the cause
related to abnormal release, the end user does not perceive it as
abnormal. This scenario is explicitly related to VoLTE calls, for other
services it is not possible to determine the reason behind the cause
code. It is typical to encounter such scenario, a so called \"double UE
Context\", when Radio Link Failure occurs during an ongoing VoLTE call
and RRC Connection Re-establishment attempt fails on target or other
cell. If then the UE does a new RRC Connection the QCI1 bearer is set-up
during Initial Context Setup in the target or other cell. However, when
MME receives that service request with the Initial UE message through
the target or other cell, it realize that it already has the same UE
Context but from the source cell (it has not been released yet). In such
case, MME sends UE Context Release Command to the source cell. As the
QCI1 E-RAB has been successfully setup in the target or other cell, the
QCI1 E-RAB release in the source cell may not be perceived as a drop
(abnormal release) by the end user, as the service has been sustained
with some interruption time, and cannot be considered as a drop in the
QCI1 E-RAB flow Drop Ratio.

From a retainability measurement aspect, E-RABs do not need to be
released because they are inactive, they can be kept to give fast access
when new data arrives.

To define (from an E-RAB release measurement point of view) if an E-RAB
is considered active or not, the E-RABs can be divided into two groups:

a\) Continuous flow, E-RABs that are always considered active, i.e.
independent of if there is ongoing traffic or not at the moment.
Examples: VoIP sessions, Real-time sessions, Live streaming sessions.

***b) Bursty*** flow, E-RABs that are only considered active when there
is data in UL/DL buffer.\
Example: Web sessions.

How to decide for a particular QCI if the E-RAB is of type bursty flow
or continuous flow is outside the scope of this document.

The specific reason causing the abnormal and failed release of the E-RAB
is required in order to find out the problem and ascertain the
solutions. And due to different priority and tolerance for different
service type with different OoS level in the networks, the monitor needs
to be opened on each service type with OoS level.

The E-RAB can be released by E-RAB Release procedure (See 3GPP TS
36.413\[9\]) , UE Context Release procedure (See 3GPP TS 36.413\[9\] and
3GPP TS 36.423\[10\]) procedure, Reset procedure(See 3GPP TS
36.413\[9\]) either initiated by eNodeB or MM, Path Switch procedure
(See 3GPP TS 36.413\[9\]) and Intra-eNB HO procedure (See 3GPP TS
36.331\[8\])E.

So performance measurements related to E-RAB Release (See 3GPP TS
36.413\[9\]) and UE Context Release (See 3GPP TS 36.413\[9\]) procedure
for each service type with QoS level are necessary to support the
monitor of E-RAB release.

A.3 Monitor of E-RAB level QoS modification
===========================================

When an E-RAB has been established, the QoS it experiences in the
E-UTRAN is dependent upon the E-RAB level QoS parameters established for
the bearer, together with settings of other bearers established in the
same cell. If the QoS experienced by a bearer does not meet the expected
performance, or the resource need be reassigned for other bearers, the
E-RAB level QoS may be adjusted (typically with a knock-on effect onto
other bearers).

So the modification of E-RAB level QoS parameters needs to be monitored,
and due to different priority and tolerance for different service type
with different OoS level in the networks, the monitor needs to be opened
on each target service type with OoS level.

The E-RAB level QoS can be modified by E-RAB Modify procedure (see 3GPP
TS 36.413\[9\]), *in which the MME entity instructs the eNodeB to change
one or more QoS parameters on an E-RAB using the E-RAB MODIFY REQUEST
message. The eNodeB typically makes the adjustments as instructed (and
adjusts the RRM applied to the bearer appropriately) but in some
circumstances the bearer modification can fail. The eNodeB returns an
E-RAB MODIFY RESPONSE message that tells the MME whether the
modification was successful or not -- for an unsuccessful modification a
cause value is included. It is important for OAM to measure the failure
rate of the bearer modifications, this information can be used, for
example, to make adjustments to OAM CM settings.*

A.5 Monitor of cell level QoS and radio resource utilisation
============================================================

In an E-UTRAN cell the quality of service achieved is directly
influenced by a number of factors, including:

\- Loading of users on the cell

\- Traffic loading and characteristics

\- UE locations and mobility

\- RRM policies

\- Scheduling

\- congestion control

\- admission control

\- layer 2 protocol configuration

\- Mapping of traffic to QCI

\- Setting of QoS parameters other than the QCI.

It is very important to be able to monitor the QoS to determine whether
the combined effect of these policies, algorithms and external factors
is satisfactory. Unsatisfactory QoS may be rectified by adjusting
policies and RRM settings, for instance.In case the rectification is not
leading to desired QoS some other policies (ACB, rejected RRC connection
setup) based on restricting the UEs for network access to the cell may
be applied

Cell bit-rate

A fundamental measure of QoS is the throughput (data rate) of the cell.
The total cell throughput measured across all radio bearers gives an
indication of the loading and activity in the cell. Adding a per QCI
counter allows the loading on the different QCIs to be measured. For
example, if QCI 1 is used exclusively for VoIP then the loading of
conversational speech can be directly determined. Finally, the maximum
throughput can indicate to the operator whether there is enough capacity
in the network; for example, is the backhaul sufficient. Separate
counters should be configured on the downlink and uplink. Complexity may
be reduced by performing the counters at layer 3, giving the ingress
bit-rate to the eNB on the downlink and the egress bit-rate from the eNB
on the uplink.

Cell throughput includes both User Plane data and Control Plane data. To
support the User Plane data, necessary Control Plane data also need to
be transmitted. This Control Plane data although required, will not be
perceived (felt) by the User. The total cell throughput helps to
evaluate the usage of bandwidth and radio resource.

Operators ideally want to see the Control Plane data as small as
possible when compared to the User Plane data without compromising on
the service.

Hence it is important to monitor the total cell throughput as well as
how much is occupied by Control Plane Data.

Number of actives UEs

It is also of interest to determine how many users are enjoying the
throughput numbers determined for each QCI. Therefore, we may count the
number of users that are active for each QCI -- here active users have
data queued pending transmission. A simple division of the throughput
(data rate) of a QCI by the number of active users on the QCI indicates
the throughput per user on the QCI. For example, taking QCI 1 this
metric could indicate the typical codec rate being employed in the cell.
Alternatively, for QCI 9 supporting low priority TCP-based traffic it
can indicate the typical bandwidth pipe size for a user when he has data
to send / receive.

DL packet delay

Latency is of prime concern for some services, particularly
conversational services like speech and instant messaging. A counter is
added to measure the mean delay for IP packets incurred within the
eNodeB. Separate counters are provided per QCI which are particularly
useful when the QCI is used by very few services and the packet sizes
vary little. It is only practical to measure packet delays on the
downlink.

In case of the eNodeB serving one or more RN, the packet delay includes
both the internal processing delay at eNB) and UE/RN as well as the
packet transferring delay on the radio link. As RN UE's packets need to
be transferred via between E-UTRAN snfRN while packets for UEs directly
connected to eNB need to pass through only Uu interface, packet delay
optimization mechanism may be different for RN UEs and eNB UEs.
Therefore it is beneficial to have measurements on packet delay
separately for packets transmitted between the eNodeB and UEs and for
packets transmitted between the E-UTRAN and RNs.

DL packet drop rate

When a cell is heavily loaded congestion can take place. When congestion
is not severe. the impact is typically the incurrence of additional
delay for non-GBR radio bearers. However, when congestion is severe the
eNodeB may be forced to discard packets. It is important for the
operator to have visibility of packet discard so that corrective action
can be instigated (for example, by adjusting admission control settings
in the network). It is only practical to measure packet discards on the
downlink. Packet discards on handover should not be included in the
count.

PRB Usage

The resource utilisation, measured in terms of physical resource blocks
(PRBs), is a useful measure of whether a cell is lightly loaded or not.
Loading is a key input to network capacity planning and load balancing.
Furthermore, when resource utilisation per QCI is reported the
distribution of resources between different services can be estimated.

The PRB usage distribution could provide operators the load distribution
information of the network during the collecting time period.According
to the PRB usage distribution information, the scenarios where a cell
may experience high load in certain short times (e.g. in a second) and
recover to normal very quickly can be recognized.The PRB usage
distribution is a useful measure for operator to be aware of whether a
cell has ever experienced high load or not in the monitoring duration.
This distribution information could also help in the root cause analysis
in case when the application problems are caused by load bursts. The
distribution information could show the median usage and the peak usage.
The median usage is within the range of the bin that got the highest
number of samples and the peak usage is within the range of the
"highest" bin that got \>0 samples. The distribution information is a
key input to network capacity planning and load balancing.

For a RN that requires subframe configuration, the RN can only be
scheduled by the eNodeB within subframes configured for RN, while macro
UE can be scheduled in any subframe. Therefore, in certain scenario it
may be possible that the PRB usage is different for the subframe
configured for the RN and for any other subframe. For example, in case
there are many RNs in the network and only a few UEs connected directly
to the eNodeB, it may happen that the PRB usage in the subframe
configured for RN is quite high, while the subframes used for UEs is
low. Therefore, it is beneficial to measure the PRB usage separately for
RN and the total PRB usage. The total PRB usage includes the PRB usage
for RN traffic and UE traffic, while the RN PRB usage includes only PRB
usage for RN traffic.

Resource Full Utilisation

Resource congestion is a critical situation in the network that needs to
be monitored closely in order to be assessed and addressed immediately
(e.g. by expanding related resources). Measurements reflecting the time
during which the resources are fully used are needed to properly assess
the congestion. Congestion affects PRB so appropriate congestion
measurements are needed.

Transport Resource Usage

Transport resource utilisation provides information on the overall
traffic of an eNodeB with the rest of the network, together with
information on the traffic of the individual cells it gives the ability
to localise bottlenecks. On the other hand it is a key input for
planning of timely expansion of transport (backhaul) resources in the
network provides . Measurements enabling to track the transport resource
utilisation are therefore useful.

Hardware Resource Usage

Hardware resource utilisation provides information on the overall load
of an eNodeB, together with the information on the individual loads it
gives the ability to localise bottlenecks. On the other hand it is a key
input for planning of timely expansion of hardware resources in the
network. Measurements enabling to track the hardware resource
utilisation are therefore useful.

Downlink Air interface packet loss rate

The downlink air interface packet loss can be directly compared with the
PELR value of a QCI to see if the packet loss (over the air interface)
aspect of quality of service is being met within the cell (see \[12\]
for more details on PELR). On the downlink this measurement can be added
to the congestion losses (see DL packet drop rate) to determine the
total packet loss rate at the eNodeB. Consequently, the downlink useful
bit-rate can be estimated by scaling the measurement of the downlink
PDCP ingress bit-rate by (1 -- DL packet drop rate) (1 -- air interface
packet loss rate).

In case or RN deployment the communicstion between the E-UTRAN and RN is
going through the air interface. It is possible that the radio
conditions are bad, which can lead also to high packet loss rate, which
can contribute also whether the packet loss aspect of the quality of
service is met or not. Therefore it is beneficial to have separate
packet loss rate measurement for RN traffic and for the traffic
connected directly to the eNodeB.

Uplink packet loss rate

The uplink air interface packet loss rate (per QCI) can be compared
directly with the PELR defined for that QCI. An estimate of the uplink
air interface packet loss may be provided by the "Uplink PDCP SDU loss
rate". This uplink measurement is based on PDCP sequence numbers and
cannot precisely measure the air interface losses. Any packets discarded
by the UE within the protocol stack (i.e. at layer 2) are also counted
since they will have been given a PDCP sequence number. Discards at
layer 3 are not counted.

In case or RN deployment the communicstion between the E-UTRAN and RN is
going through the air interface. It is possible that the radio
conditions are bad, which can lead also to high packet loss rate, which
can contribute also whether the packet loss aspect of the quality of
service is met or not. Therefore it is beneficial to have separate
packet loss rate measurement for RN traffic and for the traffic
connected directly to the eNodeB.

RACH Usage

The RACH plays a vital role in the following procedures:

> \- Initial access from RRC\_IDLE;
>
> \- Initial access after radio link failure;
>
> \- Handover requiring random access procedure;
>
> \- DL data arrival during RRC\_CONNECTED requiring random access
> procedure;
>
> \- UL data arrival during RRC\_CONNECTED requiring random access
> procedure;

Furthermore, the random access procedure takes two distinct forms:

> \- Contention based using a randomly selected preamble (applicable to
> all five events);
>
> \- Non-contention based using a dedicated preamble (applicable to only
> handover and DL data arrival).

In the use-case of RACH configuration optimization, received Random
Access Preambles and a contention indicator are signalled across an OAM
interface.

Monitoring of the preamble usage in a cell allows the operator to
determine if the resources allocated to the RACH by the eNodeB are
appropriate for the number of random access attempts. If the resources
are underutilised then the operator may reconfigure the eNodeB (via CM)
to allocate less resource to RACH thereby freeing up resource for other
uplink transmissions. Alternatively, if the resources are heavily
utilised then this is indicative of RACH congestion leading to increased
latency for the procedures listed above. To this effect, measurements
directly reflecting RACH congestion experienced by the eNodeB and by the
UEs are useful.

The eNodeB can partition the RACH resource between dedicated preambles,
randomly selected preambles in group A and randomly selected preambles
in group B. This partitioning can be evaluated when usage measurements
are made on each set separately.

To further monitor and analyze the latency of the procedures listed
above created at the RACH level, the measurement of the number of RACH
preambles sent per RACH attempt is useful.

RACH optimisation function optimises RACH related configurations to
achieve minimizing of access delays and random access collision
probability for all the UEs. eNB may request the UEs to report the
number of attempts to access the network (numberOfPreamblesSent in TS
36.331 \[8\]). Based on the attempting number of random access of all
the UEs, the eNB can know the distribution of RACH preambles sent by UEs
and calculate the access probability (AP) of a cell accurately. The eNB
may also request the UEs to report contention detected while attempting
to access the network (contentionDetected in TS 36.331 \[8\]). Based on
the estimated time per random access and the estimated contention level
in the network, the eNB can estimate the access delay probability (ADP)
of a cell.

**Time period the requested quality of service cannot be achieved**

An overload situation in the cell can be related also to other
conditions leading to insufficient QoS. That means UE is allowed for
network access but later one due to some other reason either the session
is dropped, or there is big PDCP SDU delay or low IP scheduled
throughput, etc. leading to degradation of quality of provided services.
Let's consider a UE which is having an GBR service ongoing. The radio
conditions in the cell are bad and thus despite there is no RLF detected
for the UE because the QoS characteristics for the UE like throughput
and delay cannot be achieved the UE is either abnormally released or
quality of provided services has significantly degraded. Another example
could be for the UE having an nonGBR service ongoing and RLF has been
detected which leads to abnormal UE release or significant degradation
of quality of provided services as well. In both cases despite the cell
serving the UEs did its best from the point of view the most robust MCSs
and thus maximum possible resources used, maximum UE transmit power and
using other possible techniques (like HO, redirection....) it was not
possible to keep the UEs active in the cell with guaranteed QoS simply
because the cell did not have the needed capacity (features) to do so.

For the operator it is therefore very important to have measurements to
monitor duration the requested quality of service cannot be achieved.

A.6 Monitor of the number of connected users
============================================

The number of the connected users in each cell is valuable information
for operators to know how many uses are connecting to E-UTRAN per cell
basis. This kind of information can help operator to tune the admission
control parameters for the cell and to do load balancing between cells
to ensure that the target percentage or number the of users admitted
achieve the target QoS.

A.7 Monitoring of interference situation
========================================

In the LTE radio technology interference has to be coordinated on the
basis uplink and downlink i.e. in a coordinated usage of the UL
resources (Physical Resource Blocks, PRBs) and DL Transmitted Power,
which lead to improve SIR and corresponding throughput. These are
achieved by means of mechanisms employing channel quality indicators in
support of scheduling/radio resource allocation functions.

These RRM functions in the eNB require the setting of frequency / power
restrictions and preferences for the resource usage in the different
cells. Setting and updating these parameters is the task of a network
optimisation (done by operator or automatically by SON).

Use cases for the related interference measurements are e.g.
optimisation of ICIC related RRM functionality, the detection of long
distance interferer and the interference due to spurious emissions of
neighbour cells. The later case is assumed only in high load scenarios
or unsufficent ICIC functionality due to the the fact that ICIC
functionality would minimise interference autonomously if sufficient
bandwidth is available.

The necessary measurements to identify and anylse the interference
situation as input for optimisation tasks has to be defined.

A.8 Monitor of ARQ and HARQ performance
=======================================

Reliable Packet Delivery is one of the important Performance factor for
a better User experience. HARQ retransmissions at the MAC layer ensure
reliable packet delivery

In addition, RLC can be configured to operate in acknowledged mode for
those applications that need very low packet drops and can tolerate a
slightly higher delay from RLC retransmissions.

If a MAC PDU is not delivered, HARQ takes care of retransmitting (upto a
maximum configurable number). If all the retransmissions fail at MAC
layer, and if RLC is configured to operate in acknowledged mode, RLC's
ARQ mechanism will take care of any residual packet errors.

It is important to\
a) maintain the block error rate or packet error rate within tolerable
limits

b\) ensure that HARQ retransmissions take care of most packet errors,
instead of relying on RLC layer retransmissions (which would increase
the delay).

So, it is important to monitor the performance of these schemes.\
ARQ Performance if viewed at QCI level can help in monitoring the
distribution for each of the services.

HARQ Performance if viewed at MCS (Modulation Coded Scheme) can help in
monitoring the MCS Performance also.

A.9 Monitoring of RF performance
================================

RF Performance reflects the cell loading levels and abnormal conditions.

In the Downlink, Power Resources are managed by the EUTRAN Cell(RAN).\
More Power Resources may help in increasing the Capacity of the System.
Hence, there the power resources could be effectively used to optimize
the Capacity of the System.

Hence there is a need to keep monitoring the Power Resource Utilization
in % and also in absolute terms.

Monitoring of the quality of RF signal in the cell is useful for the
purpose of NW planning and overall service quality assessment.
Measurements of Channel Quality Indicator (CQI) reported by UEs is a
useful metric reflecting RF signal quality and service quality.

Timing advance measurements reflect the distance of the UE from the cell
antenna. This information reflects the optimality of the cell antenna
location with respect to the cell traffic and is useful in the NW
planning process.

Monitoring interference, both uplink and downlink, is an important
aspect of monitoring RF performance. For this purpose, monitoring of UL
interference power is useful.

Interference signals in a number of different ways, including frequency,
frequency band, direction of interfering signals, etc. can also be
classified by System internal interference and External interference. By
efficient frequency planning and careful

Selection of base station locations, the impact of interference signal
can be effectively controlled within an acceptable scope.uplink
interference disturbs the base station receiver. Once the base station
receiver is compromised, it leads to receiving code errors for the whole
base station and the site's entire service area is degraded including
its network and service. Of course, customer satisfaction is negatively
impacted. So it is very useful to monitor uplink interference of
communication system to do network optimization.

A.10 Monitor of paging performance
==================================

In EUTRAN, Paging is under the control of the MME. When the MME wants to
page a UE it has to page it in all cells that belong to the TA(s) to
which the UE is registered.

The paging load per cell is an important measure for the operator as it
allows the operator to properly dimension the resources for paging in
the E-UTRAN Cell .

At an E-UTRAN Cell it makes sense to measure the number of discarded
paging messages if this is due to some problem in the eNodeB, such as
paging occasion overflow. In that scenario the periodicity of paging
occasions can be reconfigured in order to ensure that all paging
messages are transmitted by the eNodeB in the first available paging
occasion, thereby avoiding paging delays and extended call setup delay.

Operators need to know when such an event occurs, in order to identify
if the problem is at the E-UTRAN cell level or not.

In addition to discarded paging records measurement, it is important to
know total paging records received so that discarded paging records
ratio can be derived.

Total number of paging records received is important in the sense that,
it may be fine if the discarded paging records are high if discarded
paging records ratio is small. On the other hand, it may be problematic
if discarded paging records are low, if discarded paging records ratio
turn out to be high.

A.11 Use case of eNodeB processor usage
=======================================

When network is very busy, for example on important holiday or emergency
events happened, the traffic of one eNodeB is very heavy. So eNodeB
processor usage measurements are very important to indicate eNodeB
processor load capability. If eNodeB processor usage is too high,
operator must take action to avoid network paralysis.

A.12 Monitor of simultaneous E-RABs
===================================

E-RAB is one of the EUTRAN Cell resources which are limited in number.

Hence along with the E-RAB Setup Success Rate, there is a need to keep
monitoring the simultaneous E-RABs and having them at QCI level can help
in learning the service distribution in time periods.

Average / Maximum simultaneous E-RABs, can help to know the average /
maximum utilization of the resources in time periods, thereby helping to
do necessary resource capacity engineering.

A.13 Monitoring of Mobility Robustness Optimization (MRO)
=========================================================

The following measurement is defined specifically to monitor the
performance of handover optimisation:

\- Number of handover failures for MRO.

The measurement examines "handover related events" in which the serving
cell of a RRC connected UE is changed. Handover related events are
either normal successful handovers, or they are failures. Different
failure modes are possible and the measurement provides counts for the
occurrences of the failure modes related with MRO, "too early", "too
late" and "to wrong cell". The detailed definitions of these modes are
captured in \[12\]. The counters provide visibility of the mix of
failure problems that the handover optimistion function is tackling.

In "handover to wrong cell" case, an RLF occurs shortly after a
successful handover from a source cell (cell A in Figure A.13-1) to a
target cell (cell B in Figure A.13-1) or a HOF occurs during the
handover procedure; the UE attempts to re-establish the radio link
connection in a cell (Cell C in Figure A.13-1) other than the source
cell and the target cell. (See 36.300 \[12\]).

Figure A.13-1 Handover to wrong cell case

For the "handover to wrong cell" case (ABC) above-mentioned, the
handover parameters on Neighbour Relation AB, Neighbour Relation AC or
both may be problematic and need to be corrected. So the performance
measurements for both Neighbour Relation AB and Neighbour Relation AC
are needed for problem detection.

In addition to event-based (i.e. reactive) optimization of handover
performance, a pro-active optimization is possible by monitoring the
dynamics of handover triggering from UE measurement reports.

A.14 Monitor of BLER performance 
================================

The TB Error Rate in UL/DL can directly reflect the BLER, and has an
influence on MCS selection and user throughput. It can be helpful to
estimate the performance of radio resource management like radio
resource schedulein transport layer and be helpful in trouble shooting.
Furthermore, they should be taken into account to optimize the system
performance. To obtain TB Error Rate by calculating, the number of total
and error TBs transmitted in a cell should be monitored.

A.15 Monitoring of common LAs of overlapping target RAT's coverage
==================================================================

For CS fallback in EPS, as defined in section 5.1A of 3GPP TS 23.272
\[17\], the fallback procedure is likely to be faster if the network can
allocate a Location Area to the UE that is the LA of the overlapping
target RAT\'s coverage. For this situation, the MME should avoid
allocating TAI lists that span multiple Location Areas of the target
RAT, this can be achieved by:

\- configuring the E-UTRAN cell\'s TAI to align the LA boundary of the
target RAT;

\- the MME being configured to know which TAIs are within which LA; and

\- the MME using the TAI of the current E-UTRAN cell to derive the LAI.

Also as specified in section 4.3.4 of 3GPP TS 23.272 \[17\], to
facilitate the alignment of TA boundaries with LA boundaries, the
E-UTRAN can gather statistics (from the inbound inter-RAT mobility
events of all UEs) of the most common LAs indicated in the RRC
signalling.

From such measurements per E-UTRAN cell basis, operators 1) can know the
common LA(s) of the overlapping target RAT's coverage for each TA, which
is useful to configure the TAI list within which LA boundary to MME,
operators can also 2) detect the case that TA spans multiple LAs if
different most common LA(s) is/are reported from the E-UTRAN cells in
the same TA, operators may take actions to rectify it if needed.

A.16 Monitoring of Energy Saving
================================

Beside monitoring of the energy consumption it is also important to
differentiate if the cell unavailability or the failure of the RRC
connection establishment happens because of Energy Saving as Energy
Saving Management feature is by the Operator on purpose. Therefore such
failures should be distinguishable from other network failures,
therefore should be counted separately. With the separate cell
unavailability counter due to Energy Saving makes it possible to deduct
the cell downtime due to Energy Savings from the total cell outage.

A.17 Monitoring of RNReconfiguration
====================================

The purpose of RNReconfiguration related procedure is to
configure/reconfigure the RN subframe configuration and/or to update the
system information relevant for the RN in RRC\_CONNECTED.

The system information and subframe configuration is very important for
RN, but the RN does not need to apply the system information acquisition
and change monitoring procedures, if configured with an RN subframe
configuration. Upon change of any system information relevant to an RN,
E-UTRAN provides the system information blocks containing the relevant
system information to RNs with an RN subframe configuration via
dedicated signalling using the *RNReconfiguration* message. This
dedicated signalling replaces any stored system information acquired
through the system information acquisition procedure.

Because the RN is semi-duplex, to avoid the transmission conflict
between access link (between UE and RN) and backhaul link (between RN
and DeNB), the subframe of RN is semi-statically assigned (see TR
36.814) and the configuration information is included in the
RNReconfiguration message.

During the RN operation, failures of backhaul link will cause
unsuccessful RN reconfiguration. In that case, RN will not get any
response from DeNB. The defined performance counter will help to compute
how many respose messages are missing. Depending on this result,
operators could easily make network planning to consider fix or optimize
the backhaul link quality.

A.18 Monitoring of E-RAB setup for incoming HOs
===============================================

The E-RAB needs to be established in the target cell during HO, the
success or failure of E-RAB establishment in the target cell during HO
results in if the services beared on the E-RABs can continue or not
after HO, thus whether or not the E-RAB can be successfully established
for incoming HO impacts the user experience.

The unsuccessful setup of E-RABs with different QCIs could lead to
different user experience, thus the E-RAB setup for incoming HOs needs
to be monitored per QCI.

A.19 Use case of RSRP
=====================

E-UTRAN RSRP measurement is important for analyzing coverage probability
and coverage balance of downlink. From the distribution of this
measurement, the general coverage information can be learned. So that
coverage hole can be found more easily by driving test. Much more
measurment values with small granularity are necessary to analyze
coverage probability for specific area, such as from ratio of the number
of RSRP that is larger than or equal to threshld to the total number of
it, So it is necessary to define RSRP measurement.

According to optimization experience and the transmission bandwidth
requirement reduced, several granularity of this measurement is
proposed. For -120 dBm ≤ RSRP \< -115dBm, the granularity is 5dB, for
-115 dBm ≤ RSRP \< -80dBm, the granularity is 1dB, and for -80 dBm ≤
RSRP \< -60dBm, the granularity is 2dB.

The measurement period should be preconfigured by EMS.

A.20 Use case of RSRQ
=====================

E-UTRAN RSRQ measurement can be used to calculate signal quality
distribution. According to signal quality dstribution and other
measurements like AOA, UE Rx-Tx time diffrence, the general signal
quality information of cells can be learned, so that interference heavy
area can be found more easily by driving test. Also it can be used to
evaluate user satisfaction to some extent. So it is necessary to define
the RSRQ measurements.

In order to reduce the transmission bandwidth requirement, according to
network optimization experience, 1dB granularity of measurement is
enough.

A.21 Use case of UE power headroom
==================================

E-UTRAN UE power headroom measurement is important for analyzing UE
power distribution, to learn whether the uplink signal strength can be
increased or not. So it is very useful to do trouble shooting of
coverage hole and coverage balance for uplink. It is also used to
evaluate the power control performance and increase UE power headroom as
possible with QoS is guaranteed for the purpose of energy saving. These
questions are determined by the ratio of the number of larger or less
than threshold to the total number of it and the threshold is
configurable.

According to network optimization experience, the granularity of
measurement 1dB is enough to do trouble shooting of coverage hole and
evaluation of power control.

A.22 Use case of UE Rx--Tx time difference related measurements
===============================================================

UE Rx -- Tx time difference measurement can be used to calculate
distance distribution between UE and serving eNodeB. It is useful to
analyze traffic distribution in geographic area and to do trouble
shooting of extending coverage and blind coverage spot. The probability
of extending coverage and blind coverage should be analyzed by the ratio
of the number of UE Rx -- Tx time difference that is larger than or
equal to threshold to the total number of it. Threshold is configurable
according to the cases to be analyzed, Cases includes dense urban area
macro cell, suburban area macro cell and rural area cell.So it is
necessary to define the UE Rx--Tx time difference related measurements.

For TDD mode, propagation distance of 1Ts is nearly 9.77m. According to
optimization experience, several granularity of this measurement is
proposed. Minimize granularity of 10Ts is enough to analyze distance
distribution for near base station, namely UE Rx--Tx time difference is
less than 200Ts. For UE Rx--Tx time difference is larger than 200Ts and
less than 1000Ts, the corresponding propagation distance is from 1953m
to 9766m, the granularity of 40Ts is enough to do trouble shooting of
extending coverage. For UE Rx--Tx time difference is larger than 1000Ts
and less than 2000Ts. the granularity is 200Ts. And for UE Rx--Tx time
difference is larger than 2000Ts and less than 4096Ts, the granularity
is 1048Ts.

A.23 Use case of AOA
====================

E-UTRAN AOA value measurement can be used to calculate UE's direction
distribution of coverage to optimize network coverage together with
other measurements like RSRP, UE Rx-Tx time diffrence etc. So it is
necessary to define E-UTRAN AOA value measurement.

According to network optimization experience, 5 degrees granularity of
measurement is enough.

A.24 Monitoring of SCell scheduling on PUCCH in Carrier Aggregation
===================================================================

In the deployment scenarios for carrier aggregation as depicted in 3GPP
36.300 \[12\], the number of possible SCell per PCell can be multiple
and not fixed. So the PUCCH resource for the Scell scheduling needs to
be properly allocated, because:

\- Over-dimensioned PUCCH causes high overhead and results in reduced UL
throughput is (in general UL is not used efficiently);

\- Under-dimensioned PUCCH will result in reduced DL throughput (if no
PUCCH format 1bCS or format 3 ACK/NACK resource is available, PDSCH
cannot be allocated by the PDCCH for the SCell(s) and the UE cannot be
allocated resources on its SCell(s)).

Thus, the SCell scheduling success/blocking rate on PUCCH needs to be
monitored for evaluation of control channel usage in CA. When needed OAM
can also provide the guidance or take action to the eNB to optimize the
PUCCH dimension for CA.

A.25 Evaluation of long inactivity timer
========================================

The services from the point of view the time between the newly
successful RRC connection setup and the last RRC Connection Release can
be divided into the two groups. First group is build from the services
the time is quite long (tens of minutes or hours) while for the second
group it is tens of seconds. Typical example of the service from the
first group can be VoLTE call with a common characteristic that data
transmission is accumulated into the time period the call is active
without any long interruptions and sufficiently long period between the
two consequent calls from the same UE. A second type of service can be
web browsing with a common characteristic that data transmission is
accumulated into the smaller time periods the service is active i.e.
with long interruptions between data transmissions.

In the past operators had only option to set the inactivity timer
commonly for all kind of services. This may lead to the situation that
for the services from the first group UE had to spend ineffectively
longer time in RRC Connected state which had negative impact on UE's
battery live. On the other hand for the services from the second group
the inactivity timer setting can be insufficient which then may lead to
significant increase of the UE movements from RRC Idle to RRC Connected
state.

Operators shall therefore accurately tune the inactivity timers to avoid
some bottlenecks in the RRC Connection setup on one side and
prolongation of the UE's battery life on the second side. Especially
regarding the services where long inactivity timer applies operator
needs to have an option to estimate how intended prolongation of the
long inactivity timer is going to decrease the number of RRC Connection
Setups on one side and prolong the UEs' state in RRC Connected state on
second side, using the \"Number of successful RRC connection setups in
relation to the time between successful RRC connection setup and last
RRC connection release\".

A.26 Monitoring of Power, Energy and Environmental (PEE) parameters
===================================================================

Power, Energy and Environmental (PEE) parameters, combined with data
volume measurements, are valuable information for operators to measure
the energy efficiency of their E-UTRA network. Hence it is necessary to
define performance measurements related to E-UTRAN PEE parameters such
as power, energy, temperature, voltage, current, humidity.

A.27 Use case of UE IP throughput Distribution
==============================================

Operator may want to monitor the information of the user experience of
the network during the monitoring period. In some scenarios which the
network load becomes very high in short time, although the average IP
thoughput measured during the monitoring period is satisfactory. the
user experience may not be always satisfactory because the UE IP
throughput may significantly vary during the monitoring period. It would
be useful for operators to know the distribution information on the UE
IP throughput. This distribution information could also help in the root
cause analysis in case when the application problems are caused by load
bursts. The UE IP throughput distribution information could show the
mean throughput and the peak throughput. The median throughput is within
the range of the bin that got the highest number of samples and the peak
throughput is within the range of the "highest" bin that got \>0
samples. With the information of UE IP throughput distribution, operator
may consider to optimize the network if needed.

A.28 Monitor of the number of active UEs
========================================

The number of the active UEs in each cell is a valuable measurment for
operators to know how many UEs are with buffered data per cell basis.
This kind of information can help operators to tune the admission
control parameters for the cell and to do load balancing between cells
to ensure that the target percentage or number of the UEs admitted
achieve the target QoS. However, the number of single uplink or downlink
UEs can not effectively reflect the actual number of active UEs either
on the downlink or on the uplink in the network.

As the active UEs reflect UEs have data to transmit or receive , the
ratio of the number of active UEs to the number of the RRC connected UEs
can be established, which can be used to monitor the the cell. In
addition, compared with the number of RRC connected users, the number of
active UEs is a more effective measurement to reflect the control plane
capacity of wireless network.

A.29 Monitor of user data transmission over Xw interface for non-collocated LWA
===============================================================================

In the non-collocated LWA scenario, the Xw user plane interface (Xw-U)
is defined between eNB and WT. The Xw-U interface supports flow control
based on feedback from WT.

The Xw-U interface is used to deliver LWA PDUs (user data) between eNB
and WT for a UE. The user data

For LWA, the S1-U terminates in the eNB and, if Xw-U user data bearers
are associated with E-RABs for which the LWA bearer option is
configured, the user plane data is transferred from eNB to WT using the
Xw-U interface.

The E-UTRAN capacity needs to be determined with the user data
transmitted over Xw interface into account, including the volume of the
user data transmitted or received over Xw interface for non-collocated
LWA, the number of UEs associated with WLAN and the number of UEs
actually with user data transferred over Xw interface.

A.30 Monitor of RRC procedures for LWA
======================================

The following RRC procedures (see 3GPP TS 36.331 \[18\]) between eNB and
UE are essential to LWA (both collocated LWA and non-collocated LWA):

\- LWA WLAN mobility set configuration;

\- WLAN connection status reporting;

\- LWA specific DRB addition or reconfiguration.

The performance of these RRC procedures needs to be monitored for LWA
(both collocated LWA and non-collocated LWA).

A.31 Monitoring of user data transmission via WLAN for LWIP
===========================================================

For LWIP, the IP Packets transferred between the UE and LWIP-SeGW are
encapsulated using IPsec in order to provide security to the packets
that traverse WLAN. The end to end path between the UE and eNB via the
WLAN network is referred to as the LWIP tunnel.

A single IPSec tunnel is used per UE for all the data bearers that are
configured to send and/ or receive data over WLAN. Each data bearer may
be configured so that traffic for that bearer can be routed over the
IPsec tunnel in only downlink, only uplink, or both uplink and downlink
over WLAN.

The operator needs to know the performance regarding user data
transmission via WLAN for LWIP.

A.32 Monitoring of RRC procedures for LWIP
==========================================

The following RRC procedures (see 3GPP TS 36.331 \[8\]) between eNB and
UE are essential to LWIP:

\- LWIP WLAN mobility set configuration;

\- LWIP specific DRB addition or reconfiguration.

The performance of these RRC procedures needs to be monitored for LWIP.

A.33 Monitoring of WLAN connection status
=========================================

To enable the eNB to perform LTE and WLAN integration operation (e.g.,
LWA operation), the UE sends the WLAN Connection Status reports related
to the WLAN status and operation to the eNB.

When the connection with WLAN is failed, the UE configured with
bearer(s) on WLAN becomes unable to establish or continue LTE and WLAN
integration operation.

So it is necessary to monitor the WLAN connection status reports to
evaluate the performance of the LTE and WLAN integration.

A.34 Monitor of Secondary Node Addition for E-UTRA-NR Dual Connectivity
=======================================================================

In the E-UTRA-NR Dual Connectivity scenario, the Secondary Node Addition
procedure is initiated by the MN and is used to establish a UE context
at the SN to provide radio resources from the SN to the UE. The success
or failure of Secondary Node Addition directly impacts the quality level
for delivering the service by the networks, and also the feeling of the
end user. So the success or failure of Secondary Node Addition needs be
monitored, and for the scenarios that the path update is needed during
the Secondary Node Addition procedure, the path update related
measurements are also needed.

A.35 Monitoring of RRC connection usage per UE multi-RAT capability
===================================================================

An objective for an operator is to utilize installed network functions
as much as possible for efficiency reasons because each additional
technology layer constitutes an important portion of total capex
expenditures. A generic followed approach is to configure network
parameters so that UEs that support both new and old radio access
technology layers would camp on and use services from new radio access
technology for better cost per bit characteristics. Therefore, it is of
utmost importance for an operator to know if new technology capable UEs
are served by old radio access technology in geographical areas where
new technology is overlayed on top.

RRC connection usage per UE multi-RAT capability related measurement is
helpful for operators to identify how efficient they utilize their
deployed radio access technology layers and perform corrective actions
when needed.

A.36 Monitor of E-RAB release
=============================

E-RAB is the key and limited resource for E-UTRAN to deliver services.
The release of the E-RAB needs to be monitored as:

\- an abnormal release of the E-RAB will cause the call(/session) drop,
which directly impacts the QoS delivered by the networks, and the
satisfaction degree of the end user;

\- a successfully released E-RAB can be used to setup other requested
calls(/sessions). The E-RAB failed to be released will still occupy the
limited resource and hence it can not be used to admit other requested
calls(/sessions).

From a retainability measurement aspect, E-RABs do not need to be
released because they are inactive, they can be kept to give fast access
when new data arrives.

To define (from an E-RAB release measurement point of view) if an E-RAB
is considered active or not, the E-RABs can be divided into two groups:

a\) Continuous flow, E-RABs that are always considered active, i.e.
independent of if there is ongoing traffic or not at the moment.
Examples: VoIP sessions, Real-time sessions, Live streaming sessions.

***b) Bursty*** flow, E-RABs that are only considered active when there
is data in UL/DL buffer.\
Example: Web sessions.

How to decide for a particular QCI if the E-RAB is of type bursty flow
or continuous flow is outside the scope of this document.

The specific reason causing the abnormal and failed release of the E-RAB
is required in order to find out the problem and ascertain the
solutions. And due to different priority and tolerance for different
service type with different OoS level in the networks, the monitor needs
to be opened on each service type with OoS level.

The E-RAB can be released by E-RAB Release procedure (See 3GPP TS
36.413\[9\]) , UE Context Release procedure (See 3GPP TS 36.413\[9\] and
3GPP TS 36.423\[10\]) procedure, Reset procedure(See 3GPP TS
36.413\[9\]) either initiated by eNodeB or MM, Path Switch procedure
(See 3GPP TS 36.413\[9\]) and Intra-eNB HO procedure (See 3GPP TS
36.331\[8\])E.

So performance measurements related to E-RAB Release (See 3GPP TS
36.413\[9\]) and UE Context Release (See 3GPP TS 36.413\[9\]) procedure
for each service type with QoS level are necessary to support the
monitor of E-RAB release.

From quality point of view the E-RAB or UE Context drop ratio of the
same values in two different cells may be perceived differently by the
end user especially for VoIP services, depending on the duration of the
dropped call in comparison to intended call duration when call would not
be dropped. For example, having the E-RAB drop ratio of 90% in two cells
may be perceived differently by the end user, where in the first cell
there was a dropped call which lasted for 99% of intended call duration
and in the other cell it lasted only 40%. In the first case, the end
user with high probability may not follow up with an additional call
request, while in the second it may be the opposite as the main goal of
the conversation has not been achieved yet.

Therefore, as an extended monitoring especially for VoIP sessions
observation of the \"Distribution of Normally Released Call (QCI1 E-RAB)
Duration\" and \"Distribution of Abnormally Released Call (QCI1 E-RAB)
Duration\" is recommended.
