**TS 32.409: Performance Management (PM); Performance measurements IMS**

The present document is part of a set of specifications, which describe
the requirements and information model necessary for the standardised
Operation, Administration and Maintenance (OA&M) of a multi-vendor
3G-system.

During the lifetime of a 3G network, its logical and physical
configuration will undergo changes of varying degrees and frequencies in
order to optimise the utilisation of the network resources. These
changes will be executed through network configuration management
activities and/or network engineering, see 3GPP TS 32.600 \[3\].

Many of the activities involved in the daily operation and future
network planning of a 3G network require data on which to base
decisions. This data refers to the load carried by the network and the
grade of service offered. In order to produce this data performance
measurements are executed in the NEs, which comprise the network. The
data can then be transferred to an external system, e.g. an Operations
System (OS) in TMN terminology, for further evaluation. The purpose of
the present document is to describe the mechanisms involved in the
collection of the data and the definition of the data itself.

1 Scope
=======

The present document describes the measurements of IMS.

3GPP TS 32.401 \[5\] describes Performance Management concepts and
requirements.

The present document is valid for all measurement types provided by an
implementation of an IMS network. These may be measurement types defined
within the present document, measurements defined within other standards
bodies, or vendor specific measurement types.

Only measurement types that are specific to IMS network are defined
within the present documents. I.e. vendor specific measurement types and
measurements related to \"external\" technologies used in IMS network,
such as ATM or IP, are not covered. Instead, these could be applied as
described by the other, \"external\" standards bodies (e.g. ITU-T or
IETF) or according to manufacturer\'s documentation.

The definition of the standard measurements is intended to result in
comparability of measurement data produced in a multi-vendor network,
for those measurement types that can be standardised across all
vendors\' implementations.

The structure of the present document is as follows:

\- Header 1: Network Element (e.g. measurements related to CSCF);

\- Header 2: Measurement function (e.g. Registration related
measurements);

\- Header 3: Measurements.

2 References
============

The following documents contain provisions which, through reference in
this text, constitute provisions of the present document.

\- References are either specific (identified by date of publication
and/or edition number or version number) or non‑specific.

\- For a specific reference, subsequent revisions do not apply.

\- For a non-specific reference, the latest version applies. In the case
of a reference to a 3GPP document (including a GSM document), a
non-specific reference implicitly refers to the latest version of that
document *in the same Release as the present document*.

######## Annex A (normative): Use cases for performance measurements defintion

The present Annex provides the concrete use cases for the IMS
performance measurements defined in the present specification.

A.1 Use case of Immediate Messaging procedure related measurements at CSCF
==========================================================================

IMS users shall be able to exchange immediate messages with each other
by using the Immediate Messaging procedure. CSCF may delivery
successfully the immediate messages, also may refuse the immediate
messages or respond to the sender with fail indications.If the Immediate
Messaging procedure at CSCF is fail, the users' subjective feel to the
network will be bad.So it is necessary to define Immediate Messaging
procedure related measurements for operator to evaluate the rate of
success and failure at CSCF in IMS network.

A.2 Use case of IP-CAN Session Establishment related measurements 
=================================================================

IP-CAN session is a main procedure in policy and charging control
architecture (see 3GPP TS 29.213 \[33\]). If IP-CAN session
establishment is failed, it means that PCEF cannot get PCC rules from
PCRF and PCEF shall reject the attempt for UE-initiated resource
request. So it is necessary to define IP-CAN session establishment
related measurements to monitor or evaluate session performance of PCC
procedures.

A.3 Use case of emergency session related measurements
======================================================

Emergency session function is an important function at E-CSCF. The
emergency session related measurements can help operator to evaluate the
emergency session processing capacity and performance of IMS network
entity, analyze the establishement failure reasons of emergency session
and solve the problems. Especially the mean successful emergency session
establishment time could reflect the quality of emergency session
establishment directly and help operator to do network optimization.The
emergency session establishment procedure may not comply with the
emergency configuration policy, and these measurements can be used to
check the effectiveness of the policy.

A.4 Use case of CDIV service related measurements
=================================================

The **Communications Diversion (CDIV)** service is an important
supplementary service. It can divert user to another destination in the
communication.The **CDIV** services mainly include Communication
Forwarding Unconditional (CFU), Communication Forwarding on Busy user
(CFB), Communication Forwarding on no Reply (CFNR), Communication
Forwarding on Subscriber Not Reachable (CFNRc), Communication Forwarding
on Not Logged-in (CFNL) and Communication Deflection (CD). The
**Communications Diversion (CDIV)** service related measurements at AS
can provide information on the usage of CDIV service in the network such
as how much the CDIV services is used. The measurements are subject to
network operator bussiness community which could help operator to make
necessary actions accordingly, e.g. enhance or intorduce more similar
services or stop certain services depending on their usage amount to
ensure the target financial result of their company.

A.5 Use case of OIP and OIR service related measurements
========================================================

**The Originating Identification Presentation (OIP) is an important**
supplementary service. It **provides the terminating user with the
possibility of receiving the identity information to identify the
originating user.** The OIR service enables the originating user to
prevent presentation of its identity information to the terminating
user. The OIP/OIR service related measurements at AS can provide
information on the usage of OIP/OIR service in the network such as how
much the OIP/OIR service is used. The measurements are analyzed by the
operator business community to help the operator take necessary actions
according to the following, e.g. enhance or intorduce more similar
services or stop certain services depending on their usage to meet the
operator's requirements.

A.6 Use case of successful session establishments of inter-network domains
==========================================================================

When inter-network domain calling occurred,not only the number of
attempted session establishment but also successful session
establishment is essential. If the successful session has not been
established, it means that the attempt for inter-network calling has
been rejected.This measurement can be used to caculate the rate of
successful seesion, it will reflect the connectivity status of both
network of inter-network domain calling, and also can infulence the
feeling of users directly. So it is necessary to define successful
session establishments to monitor or evaluate session performance of
inter-network calling.

A.7 Use case of Gateway Control Session Establishment related measurements
==========================================================================

Gateway Control session is a main procedure in policy and charging
control architecture (see 3GPP TS 29.213 \[33\]). If Gateway Control
session establishment is failed, it means that BBERF cannot get PCC
rules from PCRF and BBERF shall reject the attempt for UE-initiated
resource request, the whole procedure will terminate. So it is necessary
to define Gateway Control session establishment related measurements to
evaluate session performance of PCC procedures and help the trouble
shooting.

A.8 Use case of Accumulated session time related measurements at CSCF
=====================================================================

Accumulated session time which is an important aspect of network load
could reflect the call traffic. It also reflects occupancy of session
traffic in relation to system resource and may help operators to decide
whether the network capacity expansion or network configuration
adjustment is needed.

A.9 Use case of Equipment related measurements
==============================================

Equipment related measurements help operators to monitor the equipment
(physical resource or VR) related usage and make related operation and
maintenance. CPU usage, memory usage and disk usage are of the important
items in equipment related measurements.The mean memory usage related
measurements are used to observe the usage of the memory and help to
determine whether to expand memory.

In case the IMS NF is virtualized, the performance of an IMS NF may be
impacted by the underlying VRs (i.e., virtual CPUs, virtual memories and
virtual disks). To enable the operator to anaylize the impact of the VRs
to the performance of the IMS NF, the performance of the VRs needs to be
monitored. The usage is the key measurement for the performance of the
VR, it can tell whether the VR is overloaded and whether the VR is
efficiently utilized. By correlating the VR related measurements with
the performance measurement of the IMS NF, the operator can know whether
the IMS NF performance is impacted by the VRs. When necessary, the
operator may take appropriate action to solve the performance issue of
the IMS NF, for example, to scale in/out the VNF instance that realizes
the IMS NF, or switch on/off the auto-scaling for the VNF instance.

A.10 Use case of session control related measurement per access technology
==========================================================================

Measurements on the attempt times, the success times and the failure
times of all sessions establishment per different access technologies
may help operators be aware of the users\' behavior (times and
frequency) on accessing IMS domain via different access technologies.
The access success ratio to IMS can be obtained by the division of the
access successful times and attempted times. The successful rate of
session establishment per access technology to the IMS network is
significant to operators on operation and maintainence.

A.11 Use case of CW related measurements
========================================

Call Waiting (CW) service is an important supplementary service. The
Communication Waiting (CW) service enables a UE to be informed that no
resources are available for an incoming communication. The user then has
the choice of accepting, rejecting or ignoring the incoming
communication. The Call Waiting (CW) service related measurements at AS
could provide information on the usage of CW service in the network such
as how much the CW service is used. The measurement is subject to
network operator bussiness community which could help operator to make
necessary actions accordingly, e.g. enhance or intorduce more similar
services or stop certain services depending on their usage amount to
ensure the target financial result of their company.

A.12 Use case of Hold service related measurements
==================================================

HOLD service is an important supplementary service. The Communication
Hold(HOLD) supplementary service enables a user to suspend the reception
of media stream(s) of an established IP multimedia session, and resume
the media stream(s) at a later time. The Communication Hold (HOLD)
service related measurements at AS could provide information on the
usage of HOLD service in the network such as how much the HOLD service
is used. The measurement is subject to network operator bussiness
community which could help operator to make necessary actions
accordingly, e.g. enhance or intorduce more similar services or stop
certain services depending on their usage amount to ensure the target
financial result of their company.

A.13 Use case of Call Barring related measuments
================================================

The Call Barring (CB) service is an important supplementary service
including Outgoing Communication Barring (OCB) and Incoming
Communication Barring (ICB). The OCB is a service that rejects outgoing
communications that fulfil certain provisioned or configured conditions
on behalf of the originating user. The ICB service makes it possible for
a user to have barring of certain categories of incoming communications
according to a provisioned or user configured barring program and is
valid for all incoming communications. The Anonymous Communication
Rejection (ACR) is a particular case of the ICB service that allows
barring of incoming communications from an anonymous originator on
behalf of the terminating user.The CB and ACR services related
measurements at AS can provide information on the usage of CB and ACR
services in the network such as how much the CB and ACR services is
used. The measurements are subject to network operator bussiness
community which could help operator to make necessary actions
accordingly, e.g. enhance or intorduce more similar services or stop
certain services depending on their usage amount to ensure the target
financial result of their company.

A.14 Use case of HSS related measurements
=========================================

HSS interacts with CSCF, AS, MME and SGSN via different interface with
UAR/SAR/RTR/LIR/PPR/MAR/SNR/UDR/ULR/CLR/PUR/IDR/DSR/AIR/RSR/NOR
procedures. The measurements regarding to the total request received by
HSS and the total response sent to other NEs are significant to know
about performance and load balance of HSS.

A.15 Use case of the number of release before ringing and the number of release while ringing at CSCF in session control related measurements
=============================================================================================================================================

The number of release before ringing and the number of release while
ringing reflect user behaviour factors different from the failure
procedure. Sometimes unsuccessful session establishment is caused by
user\'s own behaviour which has nothing to do with network performance.
Therefore the user behaviour factors should be measured and excluded to
evaluate the real network session establishment success rate. These two
measurements are used to support the KPI: "Session Establishment Network
Success Rate".

A.16 Use case of TIP and TIR service related measurements
=========================================================

The Terminating Identification Presentation (TIP) and Terminating
Identification Restriction (TIR) are important supplementary services.
The TIP service provides the originating party with the possibility of
receiving trusted information in order to identify the terminating
party. The TIR is a service offered to the terminating party which
enables the terminating party to prevent presentation of the terminating
identity information to originating party. The measurements are analyzed
by the operator business community to help the operator take necessary
actions according to the following, e.g. enhance or introduce more
similar services or stop certain services depending on their usage to
meet the operator's requirements.

A.17 Use case of MWI service related measurements
=================================================

The Message Waiting Indication (MWI) service is an important
supplementary service. It enables the network, upon the request of a
controlling user to indicate to the receiving user, that there is at
least one message waiting. The measurements are analyzed by the operator
business community to help the operator take necessary actions according
to the following, e.g. enhance or introduce more similar services or
stop certain services depending on their usage to meet the operator's
requirements.

A.18 Use case of FA service related measurements
================================================

The Flexible Alerting (FA) is an important supplementary service. It
causes a call to a Pilot Identity to branch the call into several legs
to alert several termination addresses (group members) simultaneously.
Additional calls may be delivered to the FA Pilot Identity at any time.
The first leg to be answered is connected to the calling party. The
other call legs are abandoned. The measurements are analyzed by the
operator business community to help the operator take necessary actions
according to the following, e.g. enhance or introduce more similar
services or stop certain services depending on their usage to meet the
operator's requirements.

A.19 Use case of CRS service related measurements

including Charging information at communication set-up time (AOC-S),
Charging information during the communication (AOC-D) and Charging
information at the end of the communication (AOC-E). The Advice Of
Charge (AOC) service allows the served user to be informed of IP
Multimedia session related charging information. The AOC-S service
provides the user with information about the charging rates at
communication establishment. The AOC-D service provides the user with
charging information for a communication during the active phase of this
communication. The network AOC-E service provides the served user with
charging information indicating the recorded charges for a communication
when this communication is released. The measurements are analyzed by
the operator business community to help the operator take necessary
actions according to the following, e.g. enhance or introduce more
similar services or stop certain services depending on their usage to
meet the operator's requirements.

A.22 Use case of CCBS and CCNR service related measurements
===========================================================

CCBS and CCNR are important supplementary services. The CCBS and CCNR
services enables a user, encountering a destination that is busy or does
not answer, to have the communication completed at a later point in time
without the user having to manually initiate a new communication

######## Annex B (informative): Void 

######## Annex C (informative): Use case of successful session establishment mean time

The establishment mean time of successful session can reflect the
response speed which is an important aspect of IMS response ability. It
can be used to evaluate the users' subjective feeling, and if the time
is too long, naturally the users will feel they are having a poor
network.

######## Annex D (informative): Use case of Number of 200 OK (Successful) messages for the roamers

The number of successful initial registrations of roamers can be a
valuable reference to decide whether the network expansion or network
