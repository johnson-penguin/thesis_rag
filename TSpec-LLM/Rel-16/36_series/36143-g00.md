3 Definitions, symbols and abbreviations
========================================

3.1 Definitions
---------------

For the purposes of the present document, the terms and definitions
given in TR 21.905 \[1\] and the following apply. A term defined in the
present document takes precedence over the definition of the same term,
if any, in TR 21.905 \[1\].

**Carrier: The modulated waveform conveying the E-UTRA or UTRA physical
channels**

**Channel bandwidth:** The RF bandwidth supporting a single E-UTRA RF
carrier with the transmission bandwidth configured in the uplink or
downlink of a cell. The channel bandwidth is measured in MHz and is used
as a reference for transmitter and receiver RF requirements.

**Channel edge:** The lowest and highest frequency of the E-UTRA
carrier, separated by the channel bandwidth.

**Donor coupling loss:** is the coupling loss between the repeater and
the donor base station.

**Downlink**: Signal path where base station transmits and mobile
receives.

**Downlink operating band:** The part of the operating band designated
for downlink.

**Maximum output power, Pmax:** This is the mean power level per carrier
measured at the antenna connector of the Repeater in specified reference
condition.

**Operating band:** A frequency range in which E-UTRA operates (paired
or unpaired), that is defined with a specific set of technical
requirements**.**

NOTE1: The operating band(s) for an E-UTRA Repeater is declared by the
manufacturer according to the designations in clause 5.5 table 5.5-1.

NOTE2: Unless specified, operating band refers to the uplink operating
band and downlink operating band.

**Output power, Pout:** This is the mean power of one carrier at maximum
repeater gain delivered to a load with resistance equal to the nominal
load impedance of the transmitter.

**Pass band:** The frequency range in which the repeater operates in
with operational configuration. This frequency range can correspond to
one or several consecutive nominal channels. If they are not consecutive
each subset of channels shall be considered as an individual pass band.
A repeater can have one or several pass bands

**Rated output power:** Rated output power of the repeater is the mean
power level per carrier that the manufacturer has declared to be
available at the antenna connector.

**Repeater:** A device that receives, amplifies and transmits the
radiated or conducted RF carrier both in the downlink direction (from
the base station to the mobile area) and in the uplink direction (from
the mobile to the base station). ~~In operating bands with one exclusive
link direction, only the dedicated link direction is repeated.~~ In
operating bands specified with only down-link or up-link, only the
up-link or down-link as specified for the operating band is repeated.

**Transmission bandwidth:** Bandwidth of an instantaneous transmission
from a UE or BS, measured in Resource Block units.

**Transmission bandwidth configuration:** The highest transmission
bandwidth allowed for uplink or downlink in a given channel bandwidth,
measured in Resource Block units.

**Uplink:** Signal path where mobile transmits and base station
receives.

**Uplink operating band:** The part of the operating band designated for
uplink.

4 General test conditions and declarations
==========================================

Many of the tests in this specification measure a parameter relative to
a value that is not fully specified in the E-UTRA specifications. For
these tests, the Minimum Requirement is determined relative to a nominal
value specified by the manufacturer.

Some requirements for the Repeater may be regional as listed in
subclause 4.2.

When specified in a test, the manufacturer shall declare the nominal
value of a parameter, or whether an option is supported.

4.1 Measurement uncertainties and test requirements
---------------------------------------------------

### 4.1.1 General

The requirements of this clause apply to all applicable tests in this
specification.

The Minimum requirements are given in 36.106 \[2\] and test requirements
are given in this specification. Test Tolerances are defined in Annex B
of this specification. Test Tolerances are individually calculated for
each test. The Test Tolerances are used to relax the Minimum
requirements in 36.106 \[2\] to create Test Requirements.

### 4.1.2 Acceptable uncertainty of test system

The maximum acceptable uncertainty of the Test System is specified below
for each test, where appropriate. The Test System shall enable the
stimulus signals in the test case to be adjusted to within the specified
tolerance and the equipment under test to be measured with an
uncertainty not exceeding the specified values. All tolerances and
uncertainties are absolute values, and are valid for a confidence level
of 95 %, unless otherwise stated.

A confidence level of 95% is the measurement uncertainty tolerance
interval for a specific measurement that contains 95% of the performance
of a population of test equipment.

For RF tests, it should be noted that the uncertainties in subclause
4.1.2 apply to the Test System operating into a nominal 50 ohm load and
do not include system effects due to mismatch between the DUT and the
Test System.

#### 4.1.2.2 Interpretation of measurement results

The measurement results returned by the Test System are compared --
without any modification -- against the Test Requirements as defined by
the Shared Risk principle.

The Shared Risk principle is defined in ITU-R M.1545 \[3\].

The actual measurement uncertainty of the Test System for the
measurement of each parameter shall be included in the test report.

The recorded value for the Test System uncertainty shall be, for each
measurement, equal to or lower than the appropriate figure in subclause
4.1.2 of this specification.

If the Test System for a test is known to have a measurement uncertainty
greater than that specified in subclause 4.1.2, it is still permitted to
use this apparatus provided that an adjustment is made as follows.

Any additional uncertainty in the Test System over and above that
specified in subclause 4.1.2 shall be used to tighten the Test
Requirement, making the test harder to pass. (For some tests e.g.
receiver tests, this may require modification of stimulus signals). This
procedure (defined in Annex B) will ensure that a Test System not
compliant with subclause 4.1.2 does not increase the chance of passing a
device under test where that device would otherwise have failed the test
if a Test System compliant with subclause 4.1.2 had been used.

4.2 Regional requirements
-------------------------

Some requirements in the present document may only apply in certain
regions either as optional requirements or set by local and regional
regulation as mandatory requirements. It is normally not stated in the
3GPP specifications under what exact circumstances that the requirements
apply, since this is defined by local or regional regulation.

Table 4.2-1 lists all requirements that may be applied differently in
different regions.

4.3 Selection of configurations for testing
-------------------------------------------

Most tests in the present document are only performed for a subset of
the possible combinations of test conditions. For instance:

\- Only one RF channel may be specified to be tested;

\- Not all channel bandwidths may be specified to be tested.

4.4 Repeater configurations
---------------------------

### 4.4.1 Power supply options

If the repeater is supplied with a number of different power supply
configurations, it may not be necessary to test RF parameters for each
of the power supply options, provided that it can be demonstrated that
the range of conditions over which the equipment is tested is at least
as great as the range of conditions due to any of the power supply
configurations.

### 4.4.2 Combining of repeaters

If the repeater is intended for combination with additional apparatus
connected to a repeater port and this combination is supplied as a
system, the combination of repeater together with the additional
apparatus shall also fulfil the repeater requirements. E.g. if the
repeater is intended for combination such that multiple repeaters
amplify the same signals into the same ports the combination shall also
fulfil the repeater requirements.

An example of such a configuration is shown in figure 4.4-1.

Figure 4.4-1: Example of repeater configuration

Figure 5.6-1 Definition of channel bandwidth and transmission bandwidth
configuration\
for one E-UTRA carrier.

Figure 5.6-1 shows the relation between the Channel bandwidth
(BW~Channel~) and the Transmission bandwidth configuration (N~RB~). The
channel edges are defined as the lowest and highest frequencies of the
carrier separated by the channel bandwidth, i.e. at F~C~ +/- BW~Channel~
/2.

5.7 Channel arrangement
-----------------------

### 5.7.1 Channel spacing

The spacing between carriers will depend on the deployment scenario, the
size of the frequency block available and the channel bandwidths. The
nominal channel spacing between two adjacent E-UTRA carriers is defined
as following:

Nominal Channel spacing = (BW~Channel(1)~ + BW~Channel(2)~)/2

where BW~Channel(1)~ and BW~Channel(2)~ are the channel bandwidths of
the two respective E-UTRA carriers. The channel spacing can be adjusted
to optimize performance in a particular deployment scenario.

### 5.7.2 Channel raster 

The channel raster is 100 kHz for all bands, which means that the
carrier centre frequency must be an integer multiple of 100 kHz.

### 5.7.3 Carrier frequency and EARFCN

The carrier frequency in the uplink and downlink is designated by the
E-UTRA Absolute Radio Frequency Channel Number (EARFCN) in the range 0
-- 65535. The relation between EARFCN and the carrier frequency in MHz
for the downlink is given by the following equation, where F~DL\_low~
and N~Offs-DL~ are given in table 5.7.3-1 and N~DL~ is the downlink
EARFCN.

F~DL~ = F~DL\_low~ + 0.1(N~DL~ -- N~Offs-DL~)

The relation between EARFCN and the carrier frequency in MHz for the
uplink is given by the following equation where F~UL\_low~ and
N~Offs-UL~ are given in table 5.7.3-1 and N~UL~ is the uplink EARFCN.

F~UL~ = F~UL\_low~ + 0.1(N~UL~ -- N~Offs-UL~)

6 Output power
==============

6.1 Definition and applicability
--------------------------------

Output power, Pout, of the repeater is the mean power of one carrier at
maximum repeater gain delivered to a load with resistance equal to the
nominal load impedance of the transmitter.

Maximum output power, Pmax, of the repeater is the mean power level per
carrier measured at the antenna connector in a specified reference
condition.

In certain regions, the minimum requirement for normal conditions may
apply also for some conditions outside the ranges defined for the Normal
test environment in Annex A2.

6.2 Minimum requirement
-----------------------

The minimum requirement is in TS 36.106 \[2\] subclause 6.1.

6.3 Test purpose
----------------

To verify that the Repeater maximum output power is within the limit
specified by the minimum requirement in 6.2.

6.4 Method of test
------------------

### 6.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: normal; see Annex A2.

A measurement system set-up is shown in annex C.

In addition, on one UARFCN only, the test shall be performed under
extreme power supply as defined in Annex A5

NOTE: Tests under extreme power supply also test extreme temperature.

1\) Connect the signal generator equipment to the Repeater input port.

2\) Connect the power measuring equipment to the Repeater output port.

### 6.4.2 Procedure

1\) Set the signal generator to transmit signal(s) in accordance to

8.4 Method of test
------------------

### 8.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: normal; see Annex A2

A measurement system set-up is shown in annex C.

1\) f\_offset\_CW is the offset between the outer channel edge frequency
of the outer channel in the pass band and a CW-signal.

2\) The test shall be performed with an f\_offset\_CW of 0.2 MHz, 0.5
MHz, 1 MHz, 5 MHz, 7,5 MHz, 10 MHz, 12,5 MHz, 15 MHz and 20 MHz,
excluding other pass bands. In addition the test shall also be performed
for all harmonic frequencies of the repeaters pass band up to 12,75 GHz,
for carrier frequency f ≤ 3.0GHz, or up to the 5^th^ harmonic of the
upper frequency edge of the DL or UL operating band, for carrier
frequency 3.0GHz \< f ≤ 4.2GHz.

### 8.4.2 Procedure

1\) Set the Repeater to maximum gain.

2\) Set the signal generator to generate a CW-signal, applied to the
input port of the Repeater. The power level of the RF input signal shall
be at least 5 dB below the power level which, when applied within the
pass band, would produce the maximum rated output power, as declared by
the manufacturer. This is to ensure that the equipment is operating in
the linear output range.

3\) The average output power in each case shall be measured using a
spectrum analyser connected to the output port of the Repeater and the
net gain shall be recorded and compared to table 8.5-1 or table 8.5-2
whichever is lower.

4\) With the same input power as in step 1) set the repeater gain to the
minimum specified by the manufacturer.

5\) The average output power in each case shall be measured using a
spectrum analyser connected to the output port of the repeater and the
net gain shall be recorded and compared to table 8.5-1 or table 8.5-2
whichever is lower.

  --------------------------------- ------------------------ ---------------------------------------------------------

9 Unwanted emissions
====================

Unwanted emissions consist of out-of-band emissions and spurious
emissions \[4\]. Out of band emissions are unwanted emissions
immediately outside the pass band bandwidth resulting from the
modulation process and non-linearity in the transmitter, but excluding
spurious emissions. Spurious emissions are emissions which are caused by
unwanted transmitter effects such as harmonics emission, parasitic
emission, intermodulation products and frequency conversion products,
but exclude out of band emissions.

The out-of-band emissions requirement for repeater is specified both in
terms operating band unwanted emissions and protection of the BS
receiver in the uplink operating band. The Operating band unwanted
emissions define all unwanted emissions in the repeater operating band
plus the frequency ranges 10 MHz above and 10 MHz below that band.
Unwanted emissions outside of this frequency range are limited by a
spurious emissions requirement.

9.1 Operating band unwanted emissions
-------------------------------------

### 9.1.1 Definition and applicability

The Operating band unwanted emission limits are defined from 10 MHz
below the lowest frequency of the repeater operating band up to 10 MHz
above the highest frequency of the repeater operating band.

The unwanted emission limits in the part of the operating band that
falls in the spurious domain are consistent with ITU-R Recommendation
SM.329 \[5\].

The requirements shall apply whatever the type of repeater considered
(one or several pass bands). It applies for all configurations foreseen
by the manufacturer's specification.

The requirements of either subclause 9.1.5.1 (Category A limits) or
subclause 9.1.5.2 (Category B limits) shall apply. The application of
either Category A or Category B limits shall be the same as for spurious
emissions (Mandatory Requirements) in subclause 9.2.5.

### 9.1.2 Minimum requirements

The minimum requirements are in TS 36.106 \[2\] sub-clause 9.1.

### 9.1.3 Test purpose

This test measures the operating band unwanted emission from the
Repeater transmitter antenna connector, while the Repeater is in
operation with, and without signal.

### 9.1.4 Method of test

#### 9.1.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: normal; see Annex A2.

A measurement system set-up is shown in annex C.

1\) Connect a signal generator to the input port of the Repeater.

> 2\) Detection mode: True RMS.

#### 9.1.4.2 Procedures

1\) Set the Repeater to maximum gain.

2\) Set the signal generator to generate signal(s) in accordance to
table 9.1.4.2-1

Table 9.1.4.2-1: Stimulus signal for operating band unwanted emissions

> at centre frequencies such that the whole signal can be fitted inside
> the repeater pass band and at level(s) which produce the manufacturer
> specified maximum output power at maximum gain.

3\) The detecting device shall be configured with a measurement
bandwidth as stated in the test requirement tables.

4\) Measure the emission at the specified frequencies with specified
measurement bandwidth and note that the measured value does not exceed
the specified value. To select the table and the maximum level, use the
repeater pass band and stimulus signal if necessary.

5\) Increase the input power with 10 dB compared to the level obtained
in step 2.

6\) Measure the emission at the specified frequencies with specified
measurement bandwidth and note that the measured value does not exceed
the specified value. To select the table and the maximum level, use the
repeater pass band and stimulus signal if necessary.

7\) If the pass band is wider than 2,8 MHz, repeat step 1) to 6) with a
new stimulus signal of the same kind, but using different centre
frequencies such that the whole signal fitted in the repeater pass band.

8\) Switch off the input signal to the repeater.

9\) Measure the emission at the specified frequencies with specified
measurement bandwidth and note that the measured value does not exceed
the specified value. To select the table and the maximum level, use the
repeater pass band.

NOTE: As a general rule the resolution bandwidth of the measuring
equipment should be equal to the measurement bandwidth. However, to
improve measurement accuracy, sensitivity and efficiency, the resolution
bandwidth may be smaller than the measurement bandwidth. When the
resolution bandwidth is smaller than the measurement bandwidth, the
result should be integrated over the measurement bandwidth in order to
obtain the equivalent noise bandwidth of the measurement bandwidth.

### 9.1.5 Test requirements

Emissions shall not exceed the maximum levels specified in the tables
below, where:

\- ∆f is the separation between the nominal pass band edge frequency and
the nominal -3dB point of the measuring filter closest to the carrier
frequency.

\- Nominal passband edge is the lowest and highest frequency of the pass
band of the repeater.

\- BW~Meas~ is the measurement bandwidth.

\- BW~Pass\ band~ is the bandwidth of the repeaters pass band.

\- f\_offset is the separation between the nominal pass band edge
frequency and the centre of the measuring filter.

\- f\_offset~max~ is the offset to the frequency 10 MHz outside the
repeater operating band.

\- ∆f~max~ is equal to f\_offset~max~ minus half of the bandwidth of the
measuring filter.

The requirements of either subclause 9.1.5.1 or subclause 9.1.5.2 shall
apply.

The Additional operating band unwanted emission limits defined in
subclause 9.1.5.3 below may be mandatory in certain regions. In other
regions it may not apply.

The requirements of subclause 9.1.5.4 shall apply.

Unless otherwise stated, all requirements are measured as mean power
(RMS).

#### 9.1.5.2 Operating band unwanted emissions (Category B)

For Category B operating band unwanted emissions, there are two options
for the limits that may be applied regionally. Either the limits in
subclause 9.1.5.2.1 or subclause 9.1.5.2.2 shall be applied.

The measurements shall apply to both paths uplink and downlink of the
Repeater.

##### 9.1.5.2.1 Category B test requirements (Option 1)

For E-UTRA FDD repeater operating in Bands 5, 6, 8, 12, 13, 14, 17, 20,
26, 27, 28, 29, 31 and 72 emissions shall not exceed the maximum levels
specified in Tables 9.1.5.2.1-1 and 9.1.5.2.1-2:

#### 9.1.5.3 Additional requirements

These requirements may be applied for the protection of other systems
operating inside or near the E-UTRA Repeater downlink operating band.
The limits may apply as an optional protection of such systems that are
deployed in the same geographical area as the E-UTRA Repeater, or they
may be set by local or regional regulation as a mandatory requirement
for an E-UTRA operating band. It is in some cases not stated in the
present document whether a requirement is mandatory or under what exact
circumstances that a limit applies, since this is set by local or
regional regulation. An overview of regional requirements in the present
document is given in subclause 4.2.

In certain regions the following requirement may apply. For E-UTRA FDD
repeaters operating in Band 5, 26, 27 or 28, emissions shall not exceed
the maximum levels specified in Table 9.1.5.3-1. The measurements shall
apply to both paths uplink and downlink of the Repeater.

In regions where FCC regulation applies, requirements for protection of
GPS according to FCC Order DA 10-534 applies for operation in Band 24.
The following normative requirement covers the repeater to be used
together with other information about the site installation to verify
compliance with the requirement in FCC Order DA 10-534. The requirement
applies to repeater operating in Band 24 to ensure that appropriate
interference protection is provided to the 1559 -- 1610 MHz band. This
requirement applies to the frequency range 1559-1610 MHz even though
part of this range falls within the operating band unwanted emissions
domain.

Note: The regional requirement in FCC Order DA 10-534 is defined in
terms of EIRP (effective isotropic radiated power), which is dependent
on both the repeater emissions at the antenna connector and the
deployment (including antenna gain and feeder loss). The EIRP level is
calculated using: P~EIRP~ = P~E~ + G~ant~ where P~E~ denotes the BS
unwanted emission level at the antenna connector, G~ant~ equals the BS
antenna gain minus feeder loss. The requirement defined above provides
the characteristics of the repeater needed to verify compliance with the
regional requirement.

In certain regions, the following requirements may apply to E-UTRA
repeaters operating in Band 32 within 1452-1492 MHz. The level of

#### 9.2.5.3 Co-existence with other systems in the same geographical area

These requirements may be applied for the protection of system operating
in frequency ranges other than the E-UTRA Repeater operating band. The
limits may apply as an optional protection of such systems that are
deployed in the same geographical area as the E-UTRA Repeater, or they
may be set by local or regional regulation as a mandatory requirement
for an E-UTRA operating band. It is in some cases not stated in the
present document whether a requirement is mandatory or under what exact
circumstances that a limit applies, since this is set by local or
regional regulation. An overview of regional requirements in the present
document is given in Clause 4.2.

Some requirements may apply for the protection of specific equipment
(UE, MS and/or BS) or equipment operating in specific systems (GSM,
UTRA, E-UTRA, etc.) as listed below.

Unless otherwise stated this requirement applies to the uplink and
downlink of the repeater, at maximum gain.

The power of any spurious emission shall not exceed the limits of Table
9.2.5.3-1 for an E-UTRA Repeater where requirements for co-existence
with the system listed in the first column apply.

+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+

NOTE 1: As defined in the scope for spurious emissions in this clause,
the co-existence requirements in Table 9.2.5.3-1 do not apply for the 10
MHz frequency range immediately outside the repeaters operating band
frequency range of an operating band (see Table 5.5-1). This is also the
case when the repeaters operating band frequency range is adjacent to
the band for the co-existence requirement in the Table 9.2.5.3-1.
Emission limits for this excluded frequency range may also be covered by
local or regional requirements.

NOTE 2: The Table 9.2.5.3-1 assumes that two operating bands, where the
frequency ranges in Table 5.5-1 would be overlapping, are not deployed
in the same geographical area. For such a case of operation with
overlapping frequency arrangements in the same geographical area,
special co-existence requirements may apply that are not covered by the
3GPP specifications.

NOTE 3: The requirements of -53dBm/100kHz in Table 9.2.5.3-1 for the up
link direction of the Repeater reflect what can be achieved with present
state of the art technology and are based on a coupling loss of 73 dB
between a Repeater and a UTRA TDD BS receiver.

NOTE 4: The requirements of -53dBm/100kHz in Table 9.2.5.3-1 shall be
reconsidered when the state of the art technology progresses.

The following requirement may be applied for the protection of PHS in
geographic areas in which both PHS and E-UTRA-FDD repeaters are
deployed. This requirement is also applicable at specified frequencies
falling between 10 MHz below the lowest frequency of the repeaters
operating band and 10 MHz above the highest frequency of the repeaters
operating band.

The power of any spurious emission shall not exceed:

Table 9.2.5.3-2: Spurious emissions limits for E-UTRA-FDD repeater in
geographic coverage area of PHS

  ---------------------- --------------- ----------------------- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following requirements shall be applied to E-UTRA-FDD repeaters
operating in Bands 13 and 14 to ensure that appropriate interference
protection is provided to 700 MHz public safety operations. This
requirement is also applicable at specified frequencies falling between
10 MHz below the lowest frequency of the repeaters operating band and 10
MHz above the highest frequency of the repeaters operating band

The power of any spurious emission shall not exceed the limits of Table
9.2.5.3-3 for an E-UTRA Repeater where requirements for co-existence
with the system listed in the first column apply.

This requirement shall be applied to repeaters operating in Band 26 to
ensure that appropriate interference protection is provided to 800 MHz
public safety operations. This requirement is also applicable at
specified frequencies falling between 12.5 MHz below the first carrier
frequency used and 12.5 MHz above the last carrier frequency used.

The power of any spurious emission shall not exceed:

#### 9.2.5.4 Co-location with base stations

These requirements may be applied for the protection of other BS
receivers when GSM900, DCS1800, PCS1900, GSM850 UTRA FDD, UTRA TDD
and/or E-UTRA BS are co-located with an E-UTRA FDD Repeater.

Unless otherwise stated the requirements assume a 30 dB coupling loss
between transmitter and receiver.

NOTE: For co-location with UTRA, the requirements are based on
co-location with Wide Area UTRA FDD or TDD base stations

Unless otherwise stated this requirement applies to the uplink and
downlink of the repeater, at maximum gain.

The power of any spurious emission shall not exceed the limits of Table
9.2.5.4-1 for an E-UTRA FDD Repeater where requirements for co-location
with a Base Station listed in the first column apply.

NOTE 1: As defined in the scope for spurious emissions in this clause,
the co-location requirements in Table 9.2.5.4-1 do not apply for the 10
MHz frequency range immediately outside the repeaters operating band
frequency range of an operating band (see Table 5.5-1). This is also the
case when the repeaters operating band frequency range is adjacent to
the frequency range of the co-location requirement in the
Table 9.2.5.4-1. The current state-of-the-art technology does not allow
a single generic solution for co-location with other system on adjacent
frequencies for 30dB Repeater-BS minimum coupling loss. However, there
are certain site-engineering solutions that can be used. These
techniques are addressed in TR 25.942 \[5\].

NOTE 2: The Table 9.2.5.4-1 assumes that two operating bands, where the
corresponding eNode B transmit and receive frequency ranges in
Table 5.5-1 would be overlapping, are not deployed in the same
geographical area. For such a case of operation with overlapping
frequency arrangements in the same geographical area, special
co-location requirements may apply that are not covered by the 3GPP
specifications.

NOTE 3: The requirements of -53dBm/100kHz in Table 9.2.5.4-1 for the up
link direction of the Repeater reflect what can be achieved with present
state of the art technology and are based on a coupling loss of 73 dB
between a Repeater and a UTRA TDD BS receiver.

NOTE 4: The requirements of -83dBm/100kHz in Table 9.2.5.4-1 for the up
link direction of the Repeater reflect what can be achieved with present
state of the art technology and are based on a coupling loss of 43 dB
between a Repeater and a UTRA TDD BS receiver.

NOTE 5: The requirements of -53dBm/100kHz and -83dBm/100kHz in Table
9.2.5.4-1shall be reconsidered when the state of the art technology
progresses.

10 Error Vector Magnitude (EVM)
===============================

10.1 Downlink Error Vector Magnitude
------------------------------------

### 10.1.1 Definition and applicability

The Error Vector Magnitude is a measure of the difference between the
ideal symbols and the measured symbols after the equalization. This
difference is called the error vector. The equaliser parameters are
estimated as defined in TS36.104 \[4\] Annex E. The EVM result is
defined as the square root of the ratio of the mean error vector power
to the mean reference power expressed in percent.

### 10.1.2 Minimum requirements

The minimum requirement is in TS 36.106 \[2\] subclause 10.1.1.

### 10.1.3 Test purpose

To verify that the downlink EVM deterioration is within the limit
specified by the minimum requirements after the signal passed through
the Repeater.

### 10.1.4 Method of test

#### 10.1.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: normal; see Annex A2

A measurement system set-up is shown in annex C.

1\) Connect the signal generator equipment to the Repeater input port.

2\) Connect the signal analyser to the Repeater output port.

#### 10.1.4.2 Procedure

1\) Set the signal generator to transmit one signal according to E-TM3.1
in TS 36.141 \[11\] of the widest possible bandwidth to fit into the
Repeater pass band.

2\) Adjust the input power to the Repeater to create the maximum nominal
Repeater output power at maximum gain.

3\) Measure the EVM and frequency error as defined in TS 36.141 \[11\]
Annex F.

4\) Repeat the procedure with all the narrower bandwidths of E-TM3.1

### 10.1.5 Test requirement

For the downlink of the Repeater the Error Vector Magnitude shall not
exceed 9,25%.

10.2 Uplink Error Vector Magnitude 
----------------------------------

### 10.2.1 Definition and applicability

The Error Vector Magnitude is a measure of the difference between the
reference waveform and the measured waveform. This difference is called
the error vector. Before calculating the EVM the measured waveform is
corrected by the sample timing offset and RF frequency offset. Then the
IQ origin offset shall be removed from the measured waveform before
calculating the EVM.

The measured waveform is further modified by selecting the absolute
phase and absolute amplitude of the Tx chain. The EVM result is defined
after the front-e or 26nd IDFT as the square root of the ratio of the
mean error vector power to the mean reference power expressed as a %.
The basic EVM measurement interval is one slot in the time domain.

### 10.2.2 Minimum requirements

The minimum requirement is in TS 36.106 \[2\] subclause 10.2.1.

### 10.2.3 Test purpose

To verify that the uplink EVM deterioration is within the limit
specified by the minimum requirements after the signal passed through
the Repeater.

### 10.2.4 Method of test

#### 10.2.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: normal; see Annex A2

A measurement system set-up is shown in annex C.

1\) Connect the signal generator equipment to the Repeater input port.

2\) Connect the signal analyser to the Repeater output port.

#### 10.2.4.2 Procedure

1\) Set the signal generator to transmit the widest bandwidth UL
reference signal according to Table A.2.2.1.2-1 in TS36.521-1 \[12\],
that can be fitted inside the repeater passband.

2\) Adjust the input power to the Repeater to create the maximum nominal
Repeater output power at maximum gain.

3\) Measure the EVM and frequency error as defined in TS 36.521-1 \[12\]
Annex E.

4\) Repeat the procedure for all narrower BW UL reference signals
according to Table A.2.2.1.2-1 in TS36.521-1 \[12\].

### 10.2.5 Test requirement

For the uplink of the Repeater the Error Vector Magnitude shall not
exceed 9,25%.

11 Input intermodulation
========================

The input intermodulation is a measure of the capability of the Repeater
to inhibit the generation of interference in the pass band, in the
presence of interfering signals on frequencies other than the pass band.

11.1 Definition and applicability
---------------------------------

Third and higher order mixing of the two interfering RF signals can
produce an interfering signal in the band of the desired channel.
Intermodulation response rejection is a measure of the capability of the
Repeater to maintain the wanted frequency free of internally created
interference.

The additional input intermodulation test requirements in Tables
11.5.2-1 may be applied for the protection of an E-UTRA FDD Repeater
input when GSM900, DCS1800, PCS1900, GSM850, UTRA FDD, UTRA TDD and/or
E-UTRA BS are co-located with an E-UTRA FDD Repeater.

The additional input intermodulation test requirements in Tables
11.5.3-1 may be applied when GSM900, DCS1800, PCS1900, GSM850, UTRA FDD,
UTRA TDD and/or E-UTRA BS operating in another frequency band co-exist
with an E-UTRA FDD Repeater.

The measurements shall apply to both paths uplink and downlink of the
Repeater, at maximum gain.

11.2 Minimum requirements
-------------------------

The minimum requirements are in TS 36.106 \[2\] sub-clause 11.1.1,
11.2.1 and 11.3.1.

11.3 Test purpose
-----------------

The purpose of this test is to verify that the Repeater meets the
intermodulation characteristics requirements as specified by the minimum
requirements.

11.4 Method of test
-------------------

### 11.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: normal; see Annex A2.

A measurement system set-up is shown in annex C.

1\) Set the Repeater to maximum gain.

2\) Connect two signal generators with a combining circuit or one signal
generator with the ability to generate several CW carriers to the input.

3\) Connect a spectrum analyser to the output of the Repeater. Set the
resolution bandwidth to 1 MHz in the centre of the pass band. Set
averaging to 1 second or more.

### 11.4.2 Procedure

1\) Adjust the frequency of the input signals, either below or above the
pass band, so that one carrier, f~1~, is 1 MHz outside the channel edge
frequency of the first or last channel in the pass band, and the lowest
order intermodulation product from the two carriers is positioned in the
centre of the pass band, according to subclause 11.2.

2\) Take the measurement of the rise of the output signal.

3\) Repeat the measurement for the opposite path of the Repeater.

11.5 Test requirements
----------------------

### 11.5.1 General requirement

The intermodulation performance should be met when the following signals
are applied to the Repeater:

Table 11.5.1-1: Input intermodulation requirement

  ------------- --------------------------- ----------------- -----------------------
  f~1~ offset   Interfering Signal Levels   Type of signals   Measurement bandwidth
  1,0 MHz       -40 dBm                     2 CW carriers     1 MHz
  ------------- --------------------------- ----------------- -----------------------

f~1~ offset is the offset from the channel edge frequency of the first
or last channel in the pass band of the closer carrier.

For the parameters specified in table 11.5.1-1, the power in the pass
band shall not increase by more than 11,2 dB at the output of the
Repeater as measured in the centre of the pass band, compared to the
level obtained without interfering signals applied.

### 11.5.2 Co-location with BS in other systems 

The intermodulation performance should be met when the following signals
are applied to the Repeater:

NOTE 1: The co-location requirements in Table 11.5.2-1 do not apply when
the repeaters pass band frequency range is adjacent to the frequency
range of the co-location requirement in the Table 11.5.2-1. The current
state-of-the-art technology does not allow a single generic solution for
co-location with other system on adjacent frequencies for 30dB
Repeater-BS minimum coupling loss. However, there are certain
site-engineering solutions that can be used. These techniques are
addressed in TR 25.942 \[5\].

NOTE 2: The Table 11.5.2-1 assumes that two operating bands, where the
corresponding eNode B transmit and receive frequency ranges in
Table 5.5-1 would be overlapping, are not deployed in the same
geographical area. For such a case of operation with overlapping
frequency arrangements in the same geographical area, special
co-location requirements may apply that are not covered by the 3GPP
specifications.

For the parameters specified in table 11.5.2-1, the power in the pass
band shall not increase with more than 11,2 dB at the output of the
repeater as measured in the centre of the pass band, compared to the
level obtained without interfering signals applied.

### 11.5.3 Co-existence with other systems

The intermodulation performance should be met when the following signals
are applied to the Repeater:

NOTE 1: The co-existence requirements in Table 11.5.3-1 do not apply
when the repeaters pass band frequency range is adjacent to the
frequency range of the co-existence requirement in the Table 11.5.3-1.
The current state-of-the-art technology does not allow a single generic
solution for co-existence.

NOTE 2: The Table 11.5.3-1 assumes that two operating bands, where the
frequency ranges in Table 5.5-1 would be overlapping, are not deployed
in the same geographical area. For such a case of operation with
overlapping frequency arrangements in the same geographical area,
special co-existence requirements may apply that are not covered by the
3GPP specifications.

For the parameters specified in table 11.5.3-1, the power in the pass
band shall not increase with more than 11,2 dB at the output of the
repeater as measured in the centre of the pass band, compared to the
level obtained without interfering signals applied.

12 Output intermodulation
=========================

12.1 Definition and applicability
---------------------------------

The output intermodulation requirement is a measure of the ability of
the repeater to inhibit the generation of intermodulation products
signals created by the presence of an interfering signal reaching the
repeater via the output port.

The output intermodulation level is the power of the intermodulation
products when a E-UTRA signal of channel bandwidth 5 MHz as an
interference signal is injected into the output port at a level of 30 dB
lower than that of the wanted signal. The wanted signal channel
bandwidth BW~Channel~ shall be the maximum bandwidth supported by the
repeater. The Interfering signal centre frequency offset from wanted
signal carrier centre frequency shall be according to the table 12.1-1..

The requirement shall apply to the downlink of the Repeater, at maximum
gain.

intermodulation requirement

12.2 Minimum requirement
------------------------

The minimum requirement is in TS 36.106 \[2\] subclause 12.1.

12.3 Test purpose
-----------------

The test purpose is to verify the ability of the repeater to restrict
the generation of intermodulation products in the presence of a subject
signal on the repeater input and output ports, and an interfering signal
applied at the repeater output port.

12.4 Method of test
-------------------

### 12.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: normal; see Annex A2.

A measurement system set-up is shown in annex C.

1\) Connect a signal generator to the input port of the Repeater (wanted
signal). Connect a signal generator to the circulator on the output port
(interfering signal) and make sure the signal generator power is
directed to the repeater output port.

> 2\) Detection mode: True RMS.

### 12.4.2 Procedure

1\) Set the Repeater to maximum gain.

2\) Set the signal generator at the repeater input port (wanted signal)
to generate a signal in accordance to test model E-TM 1.1, TS 36.141
\[11\] subclause 6.1.1.1, with a bandwidth as defined in table 12.1-1,
at the level which produce the manufacturer specified maximum output
power at maximum gain.

3\) Set the signal generator at the repeater output port (interference
signal) to generate a signal in accordance to test model E-TM 1.1, TS
36.141 \[11\] subclause 6.1.1.1, with a bandwidth, level and frequency
offset as defined in table 12.1-1.

4\) Measure the emission at the specified frequencies with specified
measurement bandwidth as described in the test requirements and note
that the measured value does not exceed the specified value.
Measurements in the band of the interfering signal shall be excluded.
The measurements can be limited to the power of all third and fifth
order intermodulation products.

5\) Repeat the test from step 3 on until all interfering signal centre
frequency offsets in table 12.1-1 has been tested, but exclude
interfering signal frequencies that are outside of the allocated
frequency band for E-UTRA downlink specified in subclause 5.3.

NOTE: As a general rule the resolution bandwidth of the measuring
equipment should be equal to the measurement bandwidth. However, to
improve measurement accuracy, sensitivity and efficiency, the resolution
bandwidth can be smaller than the measurement bandwidth. When the
resolution bandwidth is smaller than the measurement bandwidth, the
result should be integrated over the measurement bandwidth in order to
obtain the equivalent noise bandwidth of the measurement bandwidth.

12.5 Test Requirements
----------------------

In all measurements, the requirements according to either subclause
9.1.5.1 Operating band unwanted emission (Category A) and the downlink
requirements of 9.2.5.1 Spurious emission (Category A) or 9.1.5.2
Operating band unwanted emissions (Category B) and the downlink
requirements of 9.2.5.2 Spurious emission (Category B) shall be
fulfilled.

13 Adjacent Channel Rejection Ratio (ACRR)
==========================================

13.1 Definitions and applicability
----------------------------------

Adjacent Channel Rejection Ratio (ACRR) is the ratio of the RRC weighted
gain per carrier of the repeater in the pass band to the RRC weighted
gain of the repeater on an adjacent channel outside the repeater pass
band. The carrier in the pass band and in the adjacent channel shall be
of the same type (reference carrier).

The requirement shall apply to the uplink and downlink of the Repeater,
at maximum gain, where the donor link is maintained via antennas (over
the air Repeater).

### 13.1.1 Minimum requirements

There is no minimum requirement for E-UTRA signals

13.2 Co-existence with UTRA
---------------------------

This requirement shall be applied for the protection of UTRA signals in
geographic areas in which E-UTRA-FDD Repeater and UTRA BS are deployed
so that they serve adjacent channels. The reference carrier is a
UTRA-FDD carrier.

### 13.2.1 Minimum requirements

The minimum requirement is in TS 36.106 \[2\] sub-clause 13.2.1.

### 13.2.2 Test purpose

######## Annex A (normative): Environmental requirements for the Repeater

A.1 General
===========

For each test in the present document, the environmental conditions
under which the Repeater is to be tested are defined.

A.2 Normal test environment
===========================

When a normal test environment is specified for a test, the test should
be performed within the minimum and maximum limits of the conditions
stated in Table A.1-1.

Table A.1-1: Limits of conditions for Normal Test Environment

  --------------------- ------------------------------------------ ---------
  Condition             Minimum                                    Maximum
  Barometric pressure   86 kPa                                     106 kPa
  Temperature           15°C                                       30°C
  Relative Humidity     20 %                                       85 %
  Power supply          Nominal, as declared by the manufacturer   
  Vibration             Negligible                                 
  --------------------- ------------------------------------------ ---------

The ranges of barometric pressure, temperature and humidity represent
the maximum variation expected in the uncontrolled environment of a test
laboratory. If it is not possible to maintain these parameters within
the specified limits, the actual values shall be recorded in the test
report.

NOTE: This may, for instance, be the case for measurements of radiated
emissions performed on an open field test site.

A.3 Extreme test environment
============================

The manufacturer shall declare one of the following:

1\) the equipment class for the equipment under test, as defined in the
IEC 60 721-3-3 \[6\];

2\) the equipment class for the equipment under test, as defined in the
IEC 60 721-3-4 \[7\];

3\) the equipment that does not comply to the mentioned classes, the
relevant classes from IEC 60 721 documentation for Temperature, Humidity
and Vibration shall be declared.

NOTE: Reduced functionality for conditions that fall out side of the
standard operational conditions are not tested in the present document.
These may be stated and tested separately.

#### A.3.1 Extreme temperature

When an extreme temperature test environment is specified for a test,
the test shall be performed at the standard minimum and maximum
operating temperatures defined by the manufacturer's declaration for the
equipment under test.

**Minimum temperature:**

The test shall be performed with the environment test equipment and
methods including the required environmental phenomena into the
equipment, conforming to the test procedure of IEC 60 068-2-1 \[8\].

**Maximum temperature:**

The test shall be performed with the environmental test equipment and
methods including the required environmental phenomena into the
equipment, conforming to the test procedure of IEC 60 068-2-2 \[9\].

NOTE: It is recommended that the equipment is made fully operational
prior to the equipment being taken to its lower operating temperature.

A.4 Vibration
=============

When vibration conditions are specified for a test, the test shall be
performed while the equipment is subjected to a vibration sequence as
defined by the manufacturer's declaration for the equipment under test.
This shall use the environmental test equipment and methods of inducing
the required environmental phenomena in to the equipment, conforming to
the test procedure of IEC 60 068-2-6 \[10\]. Other environmental
conditions shall be within the ranges specified in clause A.2.

NOTE: The higher levels of vibration may induce undue physical stress in
to equipment after a prolonged series of tests. The testing body should
only vibrate the equipment during the RF measurement process.

A.5 Power supply
================

When extreme power supply conditions are specified for a test, the test
shall be performed at the standard upper and lower limits of operating
voltage defined by manufacturer's declaration for the equipment under
test.

**Upper voltage limit:**

The equipment shall be supplied with a voltage equal to the upper limit
declared by the manufacturer (as measured at the input terminals to the
equipment). The tests shall be carried out at the steady state minimum
and maximum temperature limits declared by the manufacturer for the
equipment, to the methods described in IEC 60 068-2-1 \[8\] Test Ab/Ad
and IEC 60 068-2-2 \[9\] Test Bb/Bd: Dry Heat.

**Lower voltage limit:**

The equipment shall be supplied with a voltage equal to the lower limit
declared by the manufacturer (as measured at the input terminals to the
equipment). The tests shall be carried out at the steady state minimum
and maximum temperature limits declared by the manufacturer for the
equipment, to the methods described in IEC 60 068-2-1 \[8\] Test Ab/Ad
and IEC 60 068-2-2 \[9\] Test Bb/Bd: Dry Heat.

A.6 Measurement of test environments
====================================

The measurement accuracy of the Repeater test environments defined in
Annex A, Test environments shall be.

> Pressure: ±5 kPa.
>
> Temperature: ±2 degrees.
>
> Relative Humidity: ±5 %.
>
> DC Voltage: ±1,0 %.
>
> AC Voltage: ±1,5 %.
>
> Vibration: 10 %.
>
> Vibration frequency: 0,1 Hz.

The above values shall apply unless the test environment is otherwise
controlled and the specification for the control of the test environment
specifies the uncertainty for the parameter.

######## Annex B (informative): Test tolerances and derivation of test requirements

The test requirements in this specification have been calculated by
relaxing the minimum requirements of the core specification using the
Test Tolerances defined here. When the test tolerance is zero, the test
requirement will be the same as the minimum requirement. When the test
tolerance is non-zero, the test requirements will differ from the
minimum requirements, and the formula used for this relaxation is given
in the following tables.

The test tolerances are derived from test system uncertainties,
regulatory requirements and criticality to system performance. As a
result, the test tolerances may sometimes be set to zero.

The test tolerances should not be modified for any reason e.g. to take
account of commonly known test system errors (such as mismatch, cable
loss, etc.).

Note that a formula for applying test tolerances is provided for all
tests, even those with a test tolerance of zero. This is necessary in
the case where the test system uncertainty is greater than that allowed
in clause 4.1.2. In this event, the excess error shall be subtracted
from the defined test tolerance in order to generate the correct
tightened test requirements as defined in this annex.

\[FFS: For example, a test system having 0.9 dB uncertainty for test 6
maximum output power (which is 0.2 dB above the limit specified in
clause 4.1.2) would subtract 0.2 dB from the test tolerance of 0.7 dB
defined in this annex. This new test tolerance of 0.5 dB would then be
applied to the minimum requirement using the formula defined in Table
B.2-1 to give a new range of ±2.5 dB of the manufacturer's rated output
power.

Using this same approach for the case where a test had a test tolerance
of 0 dB, an excess error of 0.2 dB would result in a modified test
tolerance of -0.2 dB.\]
