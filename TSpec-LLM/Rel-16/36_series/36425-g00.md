4 General
=========

4.1 General aspects
-------------------

The X2 user plane (X2 UP) protocol is located in the User Plane of the
Radio Network layer over the X2 interface.

The X2 UP protocol is used to convey control information related to the
user data flow management of E-RABs.

Each X2 UP protocol instance is associated to one E-RAB only.

This version of the present document defines the X2 UP protocol in the
context of dual connectivity only, more specifically, only for X2 user
data bearers setup for E-RABs configured with the split bearer option.

If configured, X2 UP protocol instances exist at the eNBs between which
the X2 user data bearers are setup, specifically for dual connectivity
between the MeNB and the SeNB.

NOTE: X2 user data bearers may be setup for data forwarding purposes
during X2 HO or during DC related mobility, however, these X2 user data
bearers do not require the execution of any additional E-RAB related UP
protocol functions related to an X2 UP protocol instance.

In this version of the present document, X2 UP protocol data is conveyed
by GTP-U protocol means, more specifically, by means of the \"RAN
Container\" GTP-U extension header as defined in TS 29.281 \[3\].

5 X2 user plane protocol
========================

5.1 General
-----------

The X2 UP protocol layer is using services of the transport network
layer in order to allow flow control of user data packets transferred
over the X2 interface.

5.2 X2 user plane protocol layer services
-----------------------------------------

The following functions are provided by the X2 UP protocol:

\- Provision of X2 UP specific sequence number information for user data
transferred from the MeNB to the SeNB for a specific E-RAB configured
with the split bearer option;

\- Information of successful in sequence delivery of PDCP PDUs to the UE
from SeNB for user data associated with a specific E-RAB configured with
the split bearer option;

\- Information of PDCP PDUs that were not delivered to the UE;

\- Information of the currently desired buffer size at the SeNB for
transmitting to the UE user data associated with a specific E-RAB
configured with the split bearer option;

\- Information of the currently minimum desired buffer size at the SeNB
for transmitting to the UE user data associated with all E-RABs
configured with the split bearer option.

5.3 Services expected from the X2 Transport Network Layer
---------------------------------------------------------

The X2 user plane protocol layer expects the following services from the
Transport Network Layer:

\- Transfer of user data.

5.4 Elementary procedures
-------------------------

### 5.4.1 Transfer of Downlink User Data

#### 5.4.1.1 Successful operation

The purpose of the Transfer of Downlink User Data procedure is to
provide X2-U specific sequence number information at the transfer of
user data carrying a DL PDCP PDU from the MeNB to the SeNB via the X2-U
interface.

An X2 user plane instance making use of the Transfer of Downlink User
Data procedure is associated to a single E-RAB only. The Transfer of
Downlink User Data procedure is invoked whenever user data for that
particular E-RAB needs to be sent across the X2-U interface.

The MeNB shall assign consecutive X2-U sequence numbers to each
transferred X2-U packet.

The SeNB shall detect whether an X2-U packet was lost and memorise the
respective sequence number after it has declared the respective X2-U
packet as being \"lost\".

The SeNB shall transfer the remaining PDCP PDUs towards the UE and
memorise the highest PDCP PDU sequence number of the PDCP PDU that was
successfully delivered in sequence towards the UE.

NOTE: The Transfer of Downlink User Data procedure and the associated
feedback of lost X2-U packets assist the MeNB in avoiding PDCP HFN
de-synchronisation. If an E-UTRAN deployment decides to not use the
Transfer of Downlink User Data procedure, PDCP HFN synchronization
should be ensured by other means.

Figure 5.4.1.1-1: Successful Transfer of Downlink User Data

#### 5.4.1.2 Unsuccessful operation

Void.

### 5.4.2 Downlink Data Delivery Status

#### 5.4.2.1 Successful operation

The purpose of the Downlink Data Delivery Status procedure is to provide
feedback from the SeNB to the MeNB to allow the MeNB to control the
downlink user data flow via the SeNB for the respective E-RAB. The SeNB
may also transfer uplink user data for the concerned E-RAB to the MeNB
together with a DL DATA DELIVERY STATUS frame within the same GTP-U PDU.

When the SeNB decides to trigger the Feedback for Downlink Data Delivery
procedure it shall report:

a\) the highest PDCP PDU sequence number successfully delivered in
sequence to the UE among those PDCP PDUs received from the MeNB;

b\) the desired buffer size in bytes for the concerned E-RAB;

c\) the minimum desired buffer size in bytes for the UE;

d\) the X2-U packets that were declared as being \"lost\" by the SeNB
and have not yet been reported to the MeNB within the DL DATA DELIVERY
STATUS frame.

NOTE: If an E-UTRAN deployment has decided not to use the Transfer of
Downlink User Data procedure, d) above is not applicable.

The DL DATA DELIVERY STATUS frame shall also include an indication
whether the frame is the last DL status report received in the course of
releasing a bearer from the SeNB. When receiving such indication, if
applicable, the MeNB considers that no more UL data is to be expected
from the SeNB.

The MeNB, when receiving the DL DATA DELIVERY STATUS frame:

\- regards the desired buffer size under b) and c) above as the amount
of data desired from the SeNB being declared

\- from the PDCP sequence number reported under a) above within the same
frame, as well as from the most recently reported PDCP sequence
number(s) of all other E-RABs established for the UE;

\- as the momentary desired buffer sizes, independent of buffer sizes
indicated in the past.

\- is allowed to remove the buffered PDCP PDUs according to the feedback
of successfully delivered PDCP PDUs;

\- decides upon the actions necessary to take for PDCP PDUs reported
other than successfully delivered.

After being reported to the MeNB, the SeNB removes the respective PDCP
sequence numbers.

Figure 5.5.1-1: Example frame format

Unless otherwise indicated, fields which consist of multiple bits within
an octet have the most significant bit located at the higher bit
position (indicated above frame in figure 5.5.1-1). In addition, if a
field spans several octets, most significant bits are located in lower
numbered octets (right of frame in figure 5.5.1-1).

On the X2 interface, the frame is transmitted starting from the lowest
numbered octet. Within each octet, the bits are sent according
decreasing bit position (bit position 7 first).

Bits labelled as \"Spare\" should be set to \"0\" by the sender and
should not be checked by the receiver.

The header part of the frame is always an integer number of octets. The
payload part is octet aligned (by adding \'Padding Bits\' when needed).
The total size of the frame shall not exceed 1018 octets (see TS 29.281
\[3\]).

The receiver should be able to remove an additional future extension
field that may be present.

Padding octets may be added at the end of the frame, see Padding in
5.5.3.12.

### 5.5.2 Frame format for the X2 user plane protocol

#### 5.5.2.1 DL USER DATA (PDU Type 0)

This frame format is defined to allow the SeNB to detect lost X2-U
packets and is associated with the transfer of a Downlink PDCP PDU over
the X2-U interface when the length of the PDCP SN is less than 16 bits.

The following shows the respective DL USER DATA frame.
