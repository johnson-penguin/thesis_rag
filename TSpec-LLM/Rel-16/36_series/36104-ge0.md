 4 General
=========

4.1 Relationship between minimum requirements and test requirements
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The Minimum Requirements given in this specification make no allowance
for measurement uncertainty. The test specification TS 36.141 \[4\]
Annex G defines Test Tolerances. These Test Tolerances are individually
calculated for each test. The Test Tolerances are used to relax the
Minimum Requirements in this specification to create Test Requirements.

The measurement results returned by the Test System are compared -
without any modification - against the Test Requirements as defined by
the shared risk principle.

The Shared Risk principle is defined in ITU-R M.1545 \[3\].

4.2 Base station classes
------------------------

The requirements in this specification apply to Wide Area Base Stations,
Medium Range Base Stations, Local Area Base Stations and Home Base
Stations unless otherwise stated.

Wide Area Base Stations are characterised by requirements derived from
Macro Cell scenarios with a BS to UE minimum coupling loss equal to 70
dB. The Wide Area Base Station class has the same requirements as the
base station for General Purpose application in Release 8.

Medium Range Base Stations are characterised by requirements derived
from Micro Cell scenarios with a BS to UE minimum coupling loss equal to
53 dB.

Local Area Base Stations are **characterised by requirements derived
from Pico Cell** scenarios with **a BS to UE minimum coupling loss equal
to 45 dB**.

Home Base Stations are **characterised by requirements derived from
Femto Cell** scenarios.

4.3 Regional requirements
-------------------------

Some requirements in the present document may only apply in certain
regions either as optional requirements or set by local and regional
regulation as mandatory requirements. It is normally not stated in the
3GPP specifications under what exact circumstances that the requirements
apply, since this is defined by local or regional regulation.

Table 4.3-1 lists all requirements that may be applied differently in
different regions.

4.5 Requirements for BS capable of multi-band operation
-------------------------------------------------------

For BS capable of multi-band operation, the RF requirements in clause 6
and 7 apply for each supported operating band unless otherwise stated.
For some requirements it is explicitly stated that specific additions or
exclusions to the requirement apply for BS capable of multi-band
operation.

For BS capable of multi-band operation, various structures in terms of
combinations of different transmitter and receiver implementations
(multi-band or single band) with mapping of transceivers to one or more
antenna port(s) in different ways are possible. In the case where
multiple bands are mapped on an antenna connector, the exclusions or
provisions for multi-band capable BS are applicable to this antenna
connector. In the case where a single band is mapped on an antenna
connector, the following applies:

\- Single-band ACLR, operating band unwanted emissions, transmitter
spurious emissions, transmitter intermodulation and receiver spurious
emissions requirements apply to this antenna connector that is mapped to
single-band.

\- If the BS is configured for single-band operation, single-band
requirements shall apply to this antenna connector configured for
single-band operation and no exclusions or provisions for multi-band
capable BS are applicable. Single-band requirements are tested
separately at the antenna connector configured for single-band
operation, with all other antenna connectors terminated.

For a band supported by a Base Station where the transmitted carriers
are not processed in active RF components together with carriers in any
other band, single-band transmitter requirements shall apply. For a band
supported by a Base Station where the received carriers are not
processed in active RF components together with carriers in any other
band, single-band receiver requirements shall apply.

For a BS capable of multi-band operation supporting bands for TDD, the
RF requirements in the present specification assume synchronized
operation, **where no simultaneous uplink and downlink occur** between
the supported operating bands.

The RF requirements in the present specification are FFS for multi-band
operation supporting bands for both FDD and TDD.

5 Operating bands and channel arrangement
=========================================

5.1 General

5.5 Operating bands
-------------------

E-UTRA is designed to operate in the operating bands defined in
Table 5.5-1. Unless stated otherwise, requirements specified for the TDD
duplex mode apply for downlink and uplink operations in Frame Structure
Type 2 \[4\].

NB-IoT is designed to operate in the E-UTRA operating bands 1, 2, 3, 4,
5, 7, 8, 11, 12, 13, 14, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 25, 26, 28, 31, 41 (in
certain regions), 42, 43, 65, 66, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 85, 87, 88 which
are defined in Table 5.5-1.

5.7 Channel arrangement
-----------------------

### 5.7.1 Channel spacing

The spacing between carriers will depend on the deployment scenario, the
size of the frequency block available and the channel bandwidths. The
nominal channel spacing between two adjacent E-UTRA carriers is defined
as following:

Nominal Channel spacing = (BW~Channel(1)~ + BW~Channel(2)~)/2

where BW~Channel(1)~ and BW~Channel(2)~ are the channel bandwidths of
the two respective E-UTRA carriers. The channel spacing can be adjusted
to optimize performance in a particular deployment scenario.

For 20MHz carriers in Band 46, the requirements apply for both 19.8 MHz
and 20.1 MHz nominal carrier spacing.

### 5.7.1A CA Channel spacing

For intra-band contiguously aggregated carriers the channel spacing
between adjacent component carriers shall be multiple of 300 kHz.

The nominal channel spacing between two adjacent aggregated E-UTRA
carriers is defined as follows:

where BW~Channel(1)~ and BW~Channel(2)~ are the channel bandwidths of
the two respective E-UTRA component carriers according to Table 5.6-1
with values in MHz. The channel spacing for intra-band contiguous
carrier aggregation can be adjusted to any multiple of 300 kHz less than
the nominal channel spacing to optimize performance in a particular
deployment scenario.

For intra-band contiguous carrier aggregation with two or more component
carriers in Band 46, the requirements apply for both 19.8 MHz and 20.1
MHz nominal carrier spacing between two 20 MHz component carriers, and
for 15.0 MHz nominal carrier spacing between 10 MHz and 20 MHz component
carriers.

### 5.7.2 Channel raster

The channel raster is 100 kHz for all bands, which means that the
carrier centre frequency must be an integer multiple of 100 kHz.

### 5.7.3 Carrier frequency and EARFCN

The carrier frequency in the uplink and downlink is designated by the
E-UTRA Absolute Radio Frequency Channel Number (EARFCN) in the range 0 -
262143. The relation between EARFCN and the carrier frequency in MHz for
the downlink is given by the following equation, where F~DL\_low~ and
N~Offs-DL~ are given in table 5.7.3-1 and N~DL~ is the downlink EARFCN.

F~DL~ = F~DL\_low~ + 0.1(N~DL~ -- N~Offs-DL~)

The relation between EARFCN and the carrier frequency in MHz for the
uplink is given by the following equation where F~UL\_low~ and
N~Offs-UL~ are given in table 5.7.3-1 and N~UL~ is the uplink EARFCN.

F~UL~ = F~UL\_low~ + 0.1(N~UL~ -- N~Offs-UL~)

The carrier frequency of NB-IoT in the downlink is designated by the
E-UTRA Absolute Radio Frequency Channel Number (EARFCN) in the range 0
-- 262143 and the Offset of NB-IoT Channel Number to EARFCN in the range
{-10,-9,-8,-7,-6,-5,-4,-3,-2,-1,-0.5,0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9} for FDD and in
the range
{-10,-9,-8.5,-8,-7,-6,-5,-4.5,-4,-3,-2,-1,-0.5,0,1,2,3,3.5,4,5,6,7,7.5,8,9}
for TDD. The relation between EARFCN, Offset of NB-IoT Channel Number to
EARFCN and the carrier frequency in MHz for the downlink is given by the
following equation, where F~DL~ is the downlink carrier frequency of
NB-IoT, F~DL\_low~ and N~Offs-DL~ are given in table 5.7.3-1, N~DL~ is
the downlink EARFCN, M~DL~ is the Offset of NB-IoT Channel Number to
downlink EARFCN.

F~DL~ = F~DL\_low~ + 0.1(N~DL~ -- N~Offs-DL~) + 0.0025\*(2M~DL~+1)

The carrier frequency of NB-IoT in the uplink is designated by the
E-UTRA Absolute Radio Frequency Channel Number (EARFCN) in the range 0
--262143, and the Offset of NB-IoT Channel Number to EARFCN in the range
{-10,-9,-8,-7,-6,-5,-4,-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9} for FDD and in the
range {-11,-10,-9.5,-9,-8.5,-8,-7.5,-7,-6.5,-6,-5.5,-5,
-4.5,-4,-3.5,-3,-2.5,-2,-1.5,-1,-0.5,0,0.5,1,1.5,2,2.5,3,3.5,4,4.5,5,5.5,6,6.5,7,7.5,8,8.5,9,9.5,10,
11} for TDD. The relation between EARFCN, Offset of NB-IoT Channel
Number to EARFCN and the carrier frequency in MHz for the uplink is
given by the following equation, where F~UL~ is the uplink carrier
frequency of NB-IoT, F~UL\_low~ and N~Offs-UL~ are given in table
5.7.3-1, N~UL~ is the uplink EARFCN, M~UL~ is the Offset of NB-IoT
Channel Number to uplink EARFCN.

F~UL~ = F~UL\_low~ + 0.1(N~UL~ -- N~Offs-UL~) + 0.0025\*(2M~UL~)

NOTE 1: For NB-IoT, N~DL~ or N~UL~ is different than the value of EARFCN
that corresponds to E-UTRA downlink or uplink carrier frequency for
in-band and guard band operation.

NOTE 2: For FDD M~DL~ = -0.5 is not applicable for in-band and guard
band operation. For TDD M~DL~ {-0.5,+3.5,-4.5,+7.5,-8.5} is not
applicable for in-band and guard band operation.

NOTE 3: For the carrier including NPSS/NSSS for in-band and guard band
operation, MDL is selected from {-2,-1,0,1}.

> NOTE 4: For the carrier including NPSS/NSSS for stand-alone operation,
> MDL = -0.5.

### 5.7.4 EARFCN sets for Type B multi-carrier downlink transmissions and conversion to Type 2 channel access for multi-carrier uplink transmissions on multiple Scells configured in Band 46

If the maximum frequency separation between the center frequencies of
any two of the carriers on which LAA transmissions are performed is \>
62 MHz, then on a configured set of carriers with carrier frequencies
that are a subset of any of the following sets of EARFCN, downlink
transmissions in accordance with Type B multi-carrier access procedure
as defined in 4.1.6.2 of TS 37.213 \[20\] are allowed:

\- for sets of two Scells: n-2, n-1, n, n+1, n+2 \| n = {47090, 47290},
{47490, 47690}, {47890, 48090}, {48290, 48490}, {50290, 50490}, {50690,
50890}, {51090, 51290}, {51490, 51690}, {51890, 52090}, {52290, 52490};
{52740, 52940}; {53140, 53340}

\- for sets of four Scells: n-2, n-1, n, n+1, n+2 \| n = {47090, 47290,
47490, 47690}, {47890, 48090, 48290, 48490}, {50290, 50490, 50690,
50890}, {51090, 51290, 51490, 51690}, {51890, 52090, 52290, 52490},
{52740, 52940, 53140, 53340}

\- for sets of eight Scells: n-2, n-1, n, n+1, n+2 \| n = {47090, 47290,
47490, 47690, 47890, 48090, 48290, 48490}, {50290, 50490, 50690, 50890,
51090, 51290, 51490, 51690}

Additionally, if the maximum frequency separation between the center
frequencies of any two of the carriers on which LAA transmissions are
performed is ≤ 62 MHz, then the Type B multi-carrier access procedure as
defined in 4.1.6.2 of TS 37.213 \[20\] is allowed without any of the
above EARFCN restrictions.

If the maximum frequency separation between the center frequencies of
any two of the carriers on which LAA transmissions are performed is \>
62 MHz and transmissions are permitted by national regulations, then
Type B multi-carrier access procedure is also allowed only within a
configured set of carriers that does not include any carrier frequencies
that are included in any of the sets of EARFCN above, as defined in Note
3 in Table 5.7.3-1. EARFCN values that are not included in any of the
sets of EARFCN above are as follows: n-2, n-1, n, n+1, n+2 \| n =
{46890, 48690, 50090, 53540}

For any LAA transmissions, single carrier access procedure as defined in
clause 4.1.1 and 4.1.2 of TS 37.213 \[20\] or Type A multi-carrier
access procedure as defined in clause 4.1.6.1 of TS 37.213 \[20\] are
also allowed.

On a configured set of carriers with carrier frequencies that are a
subset of any of the following sets of EARFCN, if the eNB schedules a UE
to transmit in a subframe on the configured set of carriers, and if the
UL grants scheduling PUSCH transmissions on any of the said set of
carriers indicate Type 1 channel access procedure, and if the same
\'*PUSCH starting position*\' is indicated for all carriers,
transmissions in accordance with the conditions for Type 2 channel
access specified in clause 15.2.1 of \[11\] are allowed:

\- for sets of two Scells: n-2, n-1, n, n+1, n+2 \| n = {47090, 47290},
{47490, 47690}, {47890, 48090}, {48290, 48490}, {50290, 50490}, {50690,
50890}, {51090, 51290}, {51490, 51690}, {51890, 52090}, {52290, 52490};
{52740, 52940}; {53140, 53340}

\- for sets of four Scells: n-2, n-1, n, n+1, n+2 \| n = {47090, 47290,
47490, 47690}, {47890, 48090, 48290, 48490}, {50290, 50490, 50690,
50890}, {51090, 51290, 51490, 51690}, {51890, 52090, 52290, 52490},
{52740, 52940, 53140, 53340}

> \- for sets of eight Scells: n-2, n-1, n, n+1, n+2 \| n = {47090,
> 47290, 47490, 47690, 47890, 48090, 48290, 48490}, {50290, 50490,
> 50690, 50890, 51090, 51290, 51490, 51690}

Type 2 channel access is also allowed within a configured set of
carriers that does not include any carrier frequencies that are included
in any of the sets of EARFCN above, as defined in Note 3 in Table
5.7.3-1. EARFCN values that are not included in any of the sets of
EARFCN above are as follows: n-2, n-1, n, n+1, n+2 \| n = {46890, 48690,
50090, 53540}

5.8 Requirements for contiguous and non-contiguous spectrum
-----------------------------------------------------------

A spectrum allocation where the BS operates can either be contiguous or
non-contiguous. Unless otherwise stated, the requirements in the present
specification apply for BS configured for both contiguous spectrum
operation and non-contiguous spectrum operation.

For BS operation in non-contiguous spectrum, some requirements apply
also inside the sub-block gaps. For each such requirement, it is stated
how the limits apply relative to the sub-block edges.

6 Transmitter characteristics
=============================

6.1 General
-----------

Unless otherwise stated, the requirements in clause 6 are expressed for
a single transmitter antenna connector. In case of multi-carrier
transmission with one or multiple transmitter antenna connectors,
transmit diversity or MIMO transmission, the requirements apply for each
transmitter antenna connector.

Unless otherwise stated, the transmitter characteristics are specified
at the BS antenna connector (test port A) with a full complement of
transceivers for the configuration in normal operating conditions. If
any external apparatus such as a TX amplifier, a filter or the
combination of such devices is used, requirements apply at the far end
antenna connector (port B).

Unless otherwise stated the requirements in clause 6 applies at all
times, i.e. during the Transmitter ON period, the Transmitter OFF period
and the Transmitter transient period.

Unless otherwise stated the requirements for NB-IoT in clause 6 applies
for all operation modes (In-band operation, Guard-band operation and
Stand-alone operation).

6.2 Base station output power
-----------------------------

Output power, Pout, of the base station is the mean power of one carrier
delivered to a load with resistance equal to the nominal load impedance
of the transmitter.

Rated total output power of the base station is the mean power for BS
operating in single carrier, multi-carrier, or carrier aggregation
configurations that the manufacturer has declared to be available at the
antenna connector during the transmitter ON period.

Maximum output power (P~max,c~) of the base station is the mean power
level per carrier measured at the antenna connector during the
transmitter ON period in a specified reference condition.

Rated output power, P~rated,c~, of the base station is the mean power
level per carrier for BS operating in single carrier, multi-carrier, or
carrier aggregation configurations that the manufacturer has declared to
be available at the antenna connector during the transmitter ON period.

NOTE: Different P~rated,c~ may be declared for different configurations.

NOTE: For NB-IoT in-band and guard band operation, the LTE carrier and
NB-IoT carrier shall be seen as a single carrier occupied LTE channel
bandwidth, the output power over this carrier is shared between LTE and
NB-IoT. This note is applied for Pout, Rated total output power, Pmax,c
and Prated,c.

The rated output power, P~rated,c~, of the BS shall be as specified in
Table 6.2-1.

In addition for Band 46 operation, the BS may have to comply with the
applicable BS power limits established regionally, when deployed in
regions where those limits apply and under the conditions declared by
the manufacturer. The regional requirements may be in the form of
conducted power, power spectral density, EIRP and other types of limits.
In case of regulatory limits based on EIRP, assessment of the EIRP level
is described in Annex H.

In addition for Band 49 operation in US, the BS EIRP power limit
established by FCC for Category A CBSDs (Citizens Broadband Radio
Service Devices) applies. Assessment of the EIRP level is described in
Annex H.

In addition for Band 85 NB-IoT standalone operation, the BS rated output
power limit of 43 dBm applies over the NB-IoT carriers in the range
728-729 MHz of the DL operating band. The BS output power limit of 43
dBm shall be considered as shared among all NB-IoT carriers in the
728-729 MHz frequency range or as the maximum value per NB-IoT carrier
in the case where only one NB-IoT carrier is deployed in 728-729 MHz
frequency range.

### 6.2.1 Minimum requirement

In normal conditions, the base station maximum output power, P~max,c~,
shall remain within +2 dB and -2 dB of the rated output power,
P~rated,c~, declared by the manufacturer.

In extreme conditions, the base station maximum output power, P~max,c~,
shall remain within +2.5 dB and -2.5 dB of the rated output power,
P~rated,c~, declared by the manufacturer.

In certain regions, the minimum requirement for normal conditions may
apply also for some conditions outside the range of conditions defined
as normal.

### 6.2.2 Additional requirement (regional)

For Band 34 operation in Japan, the rated output power, P~rated,c~,
declared by the manufacturer shall be less than or equal to the values
specified in Table 6.2.2-1.

### 6.2.3 Home BS output power for adjacent UTRA channel protection

The E-UTRA or E-UTRA with NB-IoT or NB-IoT Home BS shall be capable of
adjusting the transmitter output power to minimize the interference
level on the adjacent channels licensed to other operators in the same
geographical area while optimize the Home BS coverage. These
requirements are only applicable to Home BS. The requirements in this
clause are applicable for AWGN radio propagation conditions.

The output power, Pout, of the E-UTRA or E-UTRA with NB-IoT or NB-IoT
Home BS shall be as specified in Table 6.2.3-1 under the following input
conditions:

\- CPICH Êc, measured in dBm, is the code power of the Primary CPICH on
one of the adjacent channels present at the Home BS antenna connector
for the CPICH received on the adjacent channels. If Tx diversity is
applied on the Primary CPICH, CPICH Êc shall be the sum in \[W\] of the
code powers of the Primary CPICH transmitted from each antenna.

\- Ioh, measured in dBm, is the total received power density, including
signals and interference but excluding the own Home BS signal, present
at the Home BS antenna connector on the Home BS operating channel.

In case that both adjacent channels are licensed to other operators, the
most stringent limit shall apply for Pout. In the case when one of the
adjacent channels is licensed to an E-UTRA operator while the other
adjacent channel is licensed to an UTRA operator, the more stringent
limit of this clause and clause 6.2.4 shall apply for Pout. In case the
Home BS\'s operating channel and both adjacent channels are licensed to
the same operator, the requirements of this clause do not apply.

The input conditions defined for the requirements in this clause are
specified at the antenna connector of the Home BS. For Home BS receivers
with diversity, the requirements apply to each antenna connector
separately, with the other one(s) terminated or disabled. The
requirements are otherwise unchanged. For Home BS(s) without measurement
capability, a reference antenna with a gain of 0 dBi is assumed for
converting these power levels into field strength requirements.

Note 1: The Home BS transmitter output power specified in Table 6.2.3-1
assumes a Home BS reference antenna gain of 0 dBi, an target outage zone
of 47dB around the Home BS for an UE on the adjacent channel, with an
allowance of 2 dB for measurement errors, an ACIR of 33 dB, an adjacent
channel UE CPICH Ec/Io target of -18 dB and the same CPICH Êc value at
the adjacent channel UE as for the Home BS.

Note 2: For CPICH Êc \< -105dBm, the requirements in clauses 6.2.1 and
6.2.2 apply.

Note 3: The output power Pout is the sum transmit power across all the
antennas of the Home BS, with each transmit power measured at the
respective antenna connectors.

### 6.2.4 Home BS output power for adjacent E-UTRA channel protection

The E-UTRA or E-UTRA with NB-IoT or NB-IoT Home BS shall be capable of
adjusting the transmitter output power to minimize the interference
level on the adjacent channels licensed to other operators in the same
geographical area while optimize the Home BS coverage. These
requirements are only applicable to Home BS. The requirements in this
clause are applicable for AWGN radio propagation conditions.

The output power, Pout, of the E-UTRA or E-UTRA with NB-IoT or NB-IoT
Home BS shall be as specified in Table 6.2. 4-1 under the following
input conditions:

\- CRS Ês, measured in dBm, is the Reference Signal Received Power per
resource element on one of the adjacent channels present at the Home BS
antenna connector for the Reference Signal received on the adjacent
channels. For CRS Ês determination, the cell-specific reference signal
R0 according TS 36.211 \[3\] shall be used. If the Home BS can reliably
detect that multiple TX antennas are used for transmission on the
adjacent channel, it may use the average in \[W\] of the CRS Ês on all
detected antennas.

\- Ioh, measured in dBm, is the total received power density, including
signals and interference but excluding the own Home BS signal, present
at the Home BS antenna connector on the Home BS operating channel.

In case that both adjacent channels are licensed to other operators, the
most stringent limit shall apply for Pout. In the case when one of the
adjacent channels is licensed to an E-UTRA operator while the other
adjacent channel is licensed to an UTRA operator, the more stringent
limit of this clause and clause 6.2.3 shall apply for Pout. In case the
E-UTRA or E-UTRA with NB-IoT or NB-IoT Home BS\'s operating channel and
both adjacent channels are licensed to the same operator, the
requirements of this clause do not apply.

The input conditions defined for the requirements in this clause are
specified at the antenna connector of the Home BS. For E-UTRA or E-UTRA
with NB-IoT or NB-IoT Home BS receivers with diversity, the requirements
apply to each antenna connector separately, with the other one(s)
terminated or disabled. The requirements are otherwise unchanged. For
Home BS(s) without measurement capability, a reference antenna with a
gain of 0 dBi is assumed for converting these power levels into field
strength requirements.

Note 1: The E-UTRA or E-UTRA with NB-IoT or NB-IoT Home BS transmitter
output power specified in Table 6.2. 4-1 assumes a Home BS reference
antenna gain of 0 dBi, an target outage zone of 47dB around the Home BS
for an UE on the adjacent channel, with an allowance of 2 dB for
measurement errors, an ACIR of 30 dB, an adjacent channel UE Ês/Iot
target of -6 dB and the same CRS Ês value at the adjacent channel UE as
for the Home BS.

Note 2: For CRS Ês \< -127dBm, the requirements in clauses 6.2.1 and
6.2.2 apply.

Note 3: The output power Pout is the sum transmit power across all the
antennas of the Home BS, with each transmit power measured at the

### 6.2.5 Home BS Output Power for co-channel E-UTRA protection

To minimize the co-channel DL interference to non-CSG macro UEs
operating in close proximity while optimizing the CSG Home BS coverage,
E-UTRA or E-UTRA with NB-IoT or NB-IoT Home BS may adjust its output
power according to the requirements set out in this clause. These
requirements are only applicable to E-UTRA or E-UTRA with NB-IoT or
NB-IoT Home BS. The requirements in this clause are applicable for AWGN
radio propagation conditions.

For E-UTRA or E-UTRA with NB-IoT or NB-IoT Home BS that supports the
requirements in this clause, the output power, Pout, of the Home BS
shall be as specified in Table 6.2.5-1 under the following input
conditions:

\- CRS Ês, measured in dBm, is the Reference Signal Received Power per
resource element present at the Home BS antenna connector received from
the co-channel Wide Area BS. For CRS Ês determination, the cell-specific
reference signal R0 according TS 36.211 \[10\] shall be used. If the
Home BS can reliably detect that multiple TX antenna ports are used for
transmission by the co-channel Wide Area Base Station, it may use the
average in \[W\] of the CRS Ês on all detected TX antenna ports,
including R0.

\- Ioh, measured in dBm, is the total received DL power, including all
interference but excluding the own Home BS signal, present at the Home
BS antenna connector on the Home BS operating channel.

\- Iob, measured in dBm, is the uplink received interference power,
including thermal noise, within one physical resource block\'s bandwidth
of resource elements as defined in TS 36.214, present at the Home BS
antenna connector on the Home BS operating channel.

The input conditions defined for the requirements in this clause are
specified at the antenna connector of the Home BS. For E-UTRA or E-UTRA
with NB-IoT or NB-IoT Home BS receivers with diversity, the requirements
apply to each antenna connector separately, with the other one(s)
terminated or disabled. The requirements are otherwise unchanged. For
E-UTRA or E-UTRA with NB-IoT or NB-IoT Home BS(s) without measurement
capability, a reference antenna with a gain of 0 dBi is assumed for
converting these power levels into field strength requirements.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------- ------

### 6.3.2 Total power dynamic range

The total power dynamic range is the difference between the maximum and
the minimum transmit power of an OFDM symbol for a specified reference
condition.

NOTE 1: The upper limit of the dynamic range is the OFDM symbol power
for a BS at maximum output power. The lower limit of the dynamic range
is the OFDM symbol power for a BS when one resource block is
transmitted. The OFDM symbol shall carry PDSCH or sPDSCH and not contain
RS, PBCH or synchronisation signals.

NOTE 2: The requirement does not apply to Band 46.

#### 6.3.2.1 Minimum requirements

The downlink (DL) total power dynamic range for each E-UTRA carrier
shall be larger than or equal to the level in Table 6.3.2.1-1.

### 6.3.3 NB-IoT RB power dynamic range for in-band or guard band operation

The NB-IoT RB power dynamic range (or NB-IoT power boosting) for guard
band operation is the difference between the power of NB-IoT RB (which
occupies 180kHz in guard band of an E-UTRA carrier) and the average
power over all RBs (from both NB-IoT and the E-UTRA carrier containing
the NB-IoT RB).

The NB-IoT RB power dynamic range (or NB-IoT power boosting) for in-band
operation is the difference between the average power of NB-IoT REs
(which occupy certain REs in a RB of an E-UTRA carrier) and the average
power over all REs (from both NB-IoT and the E-UTRA carrier containing
the NB-IoT REs).

#### 6.3.3.1 Minimum Requirement

NB-IoT power dynamic range shall be larger than or equal to +6dB, except
for guard band operation with E-UTRA 5 MHz channel bandwidth signal
where BS manufacturer shall declare the NB-IoT dynamic range power it
could support. (in this version of the specification).

The +6 dB power dynamic range is only required for one NB-IoT RB for
both in-band and guard band operation modes.

For guard band operation, this NB-IoT RB should be placed adjacent to
the E-UTRA RB edge as close as possible (i.e., away from edge of channel
bandwidth).

6.4 Transmit ON/OFF power
-------------------------

The requirements in clause 6.4 are only applied for E-UTRA, E-UTRA with
NB-IoT and NB-IoT TDD BS.

### 6.4.1 Transmitter OFF power

Transmitter OFF power is defined as the mean power measured over 70 us
filtered with a square filter of bandwidth equal to the transmission
bandwidth configuration of the BS (BW~Config~) centred on the assigned
channel frequency during the transmitter OFF period.

For BS supporting intra-band contiguous CA, the transmitter OFF power is
defined as the mean power measured over 70 us filtered with a square
filter of bandwidth equal to the Aggregated Channel Bandwidth
**BW~Channel\_CA~ centred on (F~edge\_high~+F~edge\_low~)/2 during the
transmitter OFF period.**

#### 6.4.1.1 Minimum Requirement

The transmitter OFF power spectral density shall be less than
-85dBm/MHz.

For BS capable of multi-band operation, the requirement is only
applicable during the transmitter OFF period in all supported operating
bands.

### 6.4.2 Transmitter transient period

The transmitter transient period is the time period during which the
transmitter is changing from the OFF period to the ON period or vice
versa. The transmitter transient period is illustrated in Figure
6.4.2-1.

Figure 6.4.2-1 Illustration of the relations of transmitter ON period,
transmitter OFF period and transmitter transient period.

#### 6.4.2.1 Minimum requirements

The transmitter transient period shall be shorter than the values listed
in Table 6.4.2.1-1.

Table 6.4.2.1-1 Minimum requirements for the transmitter transient
period

  Transition   Transient period length \[us\]
  ------------ --------------------------------
  OFF to ON    17
  ON to OFF    17

6.5 Transmitted signal quality
------------------------------

The requirements in clause 6.5 apply to the transmitter ON period.

### 6.5.1 Frequency error

Frequency error is the measure of the difference between the actual BS
transmit frequency and the assigned frequency. The same source shall be
used for RF frequency and data clock generation.

#### 6.5.1.1 Minimum requirement

For E-UTRA, the modulated carrier frequency of each E-UTRA carrier
configured by the BS shall be accurate to within the accuracy range
given in Table 6.5.1-1 observed over a period of one subframe (1ms).

For NB-IoT, the modulated carrier frequency of each NB-IoT carrier
configured by the BS shall be accurate to within the accuracy range
given in Table 6.5.1-1 observed over a period of one subframe (1ms).

Table 6.5.1-1: Frequency error minimum requirement

  ----------------- --------------
  **BS class**      **Accuracy**
  Wide Area BS      ±0.05 ppm
  Medium Range BS   ±0.1 ppm
  Local Area BS     ±0.1 ppm
  Home BS           ±0.25 ppm
  ----------------- --------------

### 6.5.2 Error Vector Magnitude

The Error Vector Magnitude is a measure of the difference between the
ideal symbols and the measured symbols after the equalization. This
difference is called the error vector. The equaliser parameters are
estimated as defined in Annex E. The EVM result is defined as the square
root of the ratio of the mean error vector power to the mean reference
power expressed in percent.

For E-UTRA, for all bandwidths, the EVM measurement shall be performed
for each E-UTRA carrier over all allocated resource blocks and downlink
subframes within 10ms measurement periods for subframe TTI, and over all
allocated resource blocks and downlink sTTIs within 10ms measurement
periods for sTTI. The boundaries of the EVM measurement periods need not
be aligned with radio frame boundaries. The EVM value is then calculated
as the mean square root of the measured values. The EVM of each E-UTRA
carrier for different modulation schemes on PDSCH or sPDSCH shall be
better than the limits in table 6.5.2-1:

Table 6.5.2-1: EVM requirements for E-UTRA carrier

  Modulation scheme for PDSCH or sPDSCH   Required EVM \[%\]
  --------------------------------------- --------------------
  QPSK                                    17.5 %
  16QAM                                   12.5 %
  64QAM                                   8 %
  256QAM                                  3.5 %
  1024QAM                                 2.5 %

For NB-IoT, for all bandwidths, the EVM measurement shall be performed
for each NB-IoT carrier over all allocated resource and downlink
subframes within 10ms measurement periods. The boundaries of the EVM
measurement periods need not be aligned with radio frame boundaries. The
EVM value is then calculated as the mean square root of the measured
values. The EVM of each NB-IoT carrier on NB-PDSCH shall be better than
the limits in Table 6.5.2-2:

Table 6.5.2-2: EVM requirements for NB-IoT carrier

  Modulation scheme for NB-PDSCH   Required EVM \[%\]
  -------------------------------- --------------------
  QPSK                             17.5 %

### 6.5.3 Time alignment error

This requirement applies to frame timing in TX diversity, MIMO
transmission, carrier aggregation and their combinations.

Frames of the LTE signals present at the BS transmitter antenna port(s)
are not perfectly aligned in time. In relation to each other, the RF
signals present at the BS transmitter antenna port(s) experience certain
timing differences.

For a specific set of signals/transmitter configuration/transmission
mode, time alignment error (TAE) is defined as the largest timing
difference between any two signals.

#### 6.5.3.1 Minimum Requirement

For E-UTRA:

\- For MIMO or TX diversity transmissions, at each carrier frequency,
TAE shall not exceed 65 ns.

\- For intra-band contiguous carrier aggregation, with or without MIMO
or TX diversity, TAE shall not exceed 130 ns.

\- For intra-band non-contiguous carrier aggregation, with or without
MIMO or TX diversity, TAE shall not exceed 260 ns.

\- For inter-band carrier aggregation, with or without MIMO or TX
diversity, TAE shall not exceed 260ns.

For NB-IoT:

\- For TX diversity transmissions, at each carrier frequency, TAE shall
not exceed 65 ns.

### 6.5.4 DL RS power

For E-UTRA, DL RS power is the resource element power of the Downlink
Reference Symbol.

The absolute DL RS power is indicated on the DL-SCH. The absolute
accuracy is defined as the maximum deviation between the DL RS power
indicated on the DL-SCH and the DL RS power of each E-UTRA carrier at
the BS antenna connector.

For NB-IoT, DL NRS power is the resource element power of the Downlink
Narrow-band Reference Signal.

The absolute DL NRS power is indicated on the DL-SCH. The absolute
accuracy is defined as the maximum deviation between the DL NRS power
indicated on the DL-SCH and the DL NRS power of each NB-IoT carrier at
the BS antenna connector.

#### 6.5.4.1 Minimum requirements

For E-UTRA, DL RS power of each E-UTRA carrier shall be within ± 2.1 dB
of the DL RS power indicated on the DL-SCH.

For NB-IoT, DL NRS power of each NB-IoT carrier shall be within ± 2.1 dB
of the DL NRS power indicated on the DL-SCH.

6.6 Unwanted emissions
----------------------

Unwanted emissions consist of out-of-band emissions and spurious
emissions \[2\]. Out of band emissions are unwanted emissions
immediately outside the channel bandwidth resulting from the modulation
process and non-linearity in the transmitter but excluding spurious
emissions. Spurious emissions are emissions which are caused by unwanted
transmitter effects such as harmonics emission, parasitic emission,
intermodulation products and frequency conversion products, but exclude
out of band emissions.

The out-of-band emissions requirement for the BS transmitter is
specified both in terms of Adjacent Channel Leakage power Ratio (ACLR)
and Operating band unwanted emissions. The Operating band unwanted
emissions define all unwanted emissions in each supported downlink
operating band plus the frequency ranges 10 MHz above and 10 MHz below
each band. Unwanted emissions outside of this frequency range are
limited by a spurious emissions requirement.

For a BS supporting multi-carrier or intra-band contiguous CA, the
unwanted emissions requirements apply to channel bandwidths of the
outermost carrier larger than or equal to 5 MHz.

There is in addition a requirement for occupied bandwidth.

### 6.6.1 Occupied bandwidth

The occupied bandwidth is the width of a frequency band such that, below
the lower and above the upper frequency limits, the mean powers emitted
are each equal to a specified percentage β/2 of the total mean
transmitted power. See also ITU-R Recommendation SM.328 \[5\].

The value of β/2 shall be taken as 0.5%.

The requirement applies during the transmitter ON period.

#### 6.6.1.1 Minimum requirement

For E-UTRA, the occupied bandwidth for each E-UTRA carrier shall be less
than the channel bandwidth as defined in Table 5.6-1. For intra-band
contiguous CA, t**he occupied bandwidth shall be less than or equal to
the Aggregated Channel Bandwidth as defined in clause 5.6**. For Band 46
operation in Japan, the occupied bandwidth for each 20MHz channel
bandwidth E-UTRA carrier assigned within 5150-5350 MHz and 5470-5725 MHz
shall be less than or equal to 19 MHz and 19.7MHz respectively.

For NB-IoT in-band operation, the occupied bandwidth for each E-UTRA
carrier with NB-IoT shall be less than the channel bandwidth as defined
in Table 5.6-1.

For NB-IoT guard band operation, the occupied bandwidth for each E-UTRA
carrier with NB-IoT shall be less than the channel bandwidth as defined
in Table 5.6-1 for channel bandwidth larger than or equal to 5 MHz.

For NB-IoT standalone operation, the occupied bandwidth for each NB-IoT
carrier shall be less than the channel bandwidth as defined in
Table 5.6-3.

### 6.6.2 Adjacent Channel Leakage power Ratio (ACLR)

Adjacent Channel Leakage power Ratio (ACLR) is the ratio of the filtered
mean power centred on the assigned channel frequency to the filtered
mean power centred on an adjacent channel frequency.

The requirements shall apply outside the Base Station RF Bandwidth or
Radio Bandwidth whatever the type of transmitter considered (single
carrier or multi-carrier) and for all transmission modes foreseen by the
manufacturer\'s specification.

For a E-UTRA or E-UTRA with NB-IoT (in-band and/or guard band) BS
operating in non-contiguous spectrum, the ACLR also applies for the
first adjacent channel inside any sub-block gap with a gap size W~gap~ ≥
15MHz or W~gap~ ≥ 60MHz for Band 46. The ACLR requirement for the second
adjacent channel applies inside any sub-block gap with a gap size W~gap~
≥ 20 MHz or W~gap~ ≥ 80MHz for Band 46. The CACLR requirement in clause
6.6.2.2 applies in sub block gaps for the frequency ranges defined in
Table 6.6.2.2-1/2/2a.

For a E-UTRA or E-UTRA with NB-IoT (in-band and/or guard band) BS
operating in multiple bands, where multiple bands are mapped onto the
same antenna connector, the ACLR also applies for the first adjacent
channel inside any Inter RF Bandwidth gap with a gap size W~gap~ ≥
15MHz. The ACLR requirement for the second adjacent channel applies
inside any Inter RF Bandwidth gap with a gap size W~gap~ ≥ 20 MHz. The
CACLR requirement in clause 6.6.2.2 applies in Inter RF Bandwidth gaps
for the frequency ranges defined in Table 6.6.2.2-1/2.

The requirement applies during the transmitter ON period.

#### 6.6.2.1 Minimum requirement

The ACLR is defined with a square filter of bandwidth equal to the
transmission bandwidth configuration of the transmitted signal
(BW~Config~) centred on the assigned channel frequency and a filter
centred on the adjacent channel frequency according to the tables below.

For Category A Wide Area BS, either the ACLR limits in the tables below
or the absolute limit of -13dBm/MHz shall apply, whichever is less
stringent.

For Category B Wide Area BS, either the ACLR limits in the tables below
or the absolute limit of -15dBm/MHz shall apply, whichever is less
stringent.

For Medium Range BS, either the ACLR limits in the tables below or the
absolute limit of -25 dBm/MHz shall apply, whichever is less stringent.

For Local Area BS, either the ACLR limits in the tables below or the
absolute limit of -32dBm/MHz shall apply, whichever is less stringent.

For Home BS, either the ACLR limits in the tables below or the absolute
limit of -50dBm/MHz shall apply, whichever is less stringent.

The ACLR requirements in Tables 6.6.2.1-1 to 6.6.2.1-4 (except Table
6.6.2.1-2b) apply to BS that supports E-UTRA or E-UTRA with NB-IoT
(in-band and/or guard band), in any operating band except for Band 46.
The ACLR requirements for Band 46 are in Table 6.6.2.1-2a and 6.6.2.1-5.
The ACLR requirements in Table 6.6.2.1-2b and 6.6.2.1-6 apply to BS that
supports standalone NB-IoT.

For operation in paired spectrum, the ACLR shall be higher than the
value specified in Table 6.6.2.1‑1.

#### 6.6.2.2 Cumulative ACLR requirement in non-contiguous spectrum

The following requirement applies for the sub-block or Inter RF
Bandwidth gap sizes listed in Table 6.6.2.2-1/2/2a,

\- Inside a sub-block gap within an operating band for a BS operating in
non-contiguous spectrum.

\- Inside an Inter RF Bandwidth gap for a BS operating in multiple
bands, where multiple bands are mapped on the same antenna connector.

The Cumulative Adjacent Channel Leakage power Ratio (CACLR) in a
sub-block gap or the Inter RF Bandwidth gap is the ratio of:

a\) the sum of the filtered mean power centred on the assigned channel
frequencies for the two carriers adjacent to each side of the sub-block
gap or the Inter RF Bandwidth gap, and

b\) the filtered mean power centred on a frequency channel adjacent to
one of the respective sub-block edges or Base Station RF Bandwidth
edges.

The assumed filter for the adjacent channel frequency is defined in
Table 6.6.2.2-1/2/2a and the filters on the assigned channels are
defined in Table 6.6.2.2-3.

For Wide Area Category A BS, either the CACLR limits in Table
6.6.2.2-1/2 or the absolute limit of -13dBm/MHz shall apply, whichever
is less stringent.

For Wide Area Category B BS, either the CACLR limits in Table
6.6.2.2-1/2 or the absolute limit of -15dBm/MHz shall apply, whichever
is less stringent.

For Medium Range BS, either the CACLR limits in Table 6.6.2.2-1/2/2a or
the absolute limit of -25 dBm/MHz shall apply, whichever is less
stringent.

For Local Area BS, either the CACLR limits in Table 6.6.2.2-1/2/2a or
the absolute limit of -32 dBm/MHz shall apply, whichever is less
stringent.

The ACLR requirements in Tables 6.6.2.2-1 and 6.6.2.2-2 apply to BS that
supports E-UTRA, in any operating band except for Band 46. The ACLR
requirements for Band 46 are in Table 6.6.2.2-2a.

For operation in non-contiguous spectrum or multiple bands, the CACLR
for E-UTRA carriers located on either side of the sub-block gap or the
Inter RF Bandwidth gap shall be higher than the value specified in Table
6.6.2.2-1/2.

### 6.6.3 Operating band unwanted emissions

Unless otherwise stated, the Operating band unwanted emission limits are
defined from 10 MHz below the lowest frequency of each supported
downlink operating band up to 10 MHz above the highest frequency of each
supported downlink operating band.

The requirements shall apply whatever the type of transmitter considered
(single carrier or multi-carrier) and for all transmission modes
foreseen by the manufacturer\'s specification. In addition, for a BS
operating in non-contiguous spectrum, the requirements apply inside any
sub-block gap. In addition, for a BS operating in multiple bands, the
requirements apply inside any Inter RF Bandwidth gap.

For BS capable of multi-band operation where multiple bands are mapped
on separate antenna connectors, the single-band requirements apply and
the cumulative evaluation of the emission limit in the Inter RF
Bandwidth gap are not applicable.

For a BS supporting E-UTRA with NB-IoT guard band operation, the
Operating band unwanted emissions requirements apply to E-UTRA carrier
with channel bandwidth larger than or equal to 5 MHz.

The unwanted emission limits in the part of the downlink operating band
that falls in the spurious domain are consistent with ITU-R
Recommendation SM.329 \[2\].

Emissions shall not exceed the maximum levels specified in the tables
below, where:

\- ∆f is the separation between the Base Station RF Bandwidth edge
frequency and the nominal -3dB point of the measuring filter closest to
the carrier frequency.

\- f\_offset is the separation between the Base Station RF Bandwidth
edge frequency and the centre of the measuring filter.

\- f\_offset~max~ is the offset to the frequency 10 MHz outside the
downlink operating band.

\- ∆f~max~ is equal to f\_offset~max~ minus half of the bandwidth of the
measuring filter.

For E-UTRA or E-UTRA with NB-IoT (in-band and/or guard band) BS
operating in multiple bands, inside any Inter RF Bandwidth gaps with
W~gap~ \< 20 MHz, emissions shall not exceed the cumulative sum of the
minimum requirements specified at the Base Station RF Bandwidth edges on
each side of the Inter RF Bandwidth gap. The minimum requirement for
Base Station RF Bandwidth edge is specified in Tables 6.6.3.1-1 to
6.6.3.3-3 below, where in this case:

\- ∆f is the separation between the Base Station RF Bandwidth edge
frequency and the nominal -3 dB point of the measuring filter closest to
the Base Station RF Bandwidth edge.

\- f\_offset is the separation between the Base Station RF Bandwidth
edge frequency and the centre of the measuring filter.

\- f\_offset~max~ is equal to the Inter RF Bandwidth gap minus half of
the bandwidth of the measuring filter.

\- ∆f~max~ is equal to f\_offset~max~ minus half of the bandwidth of the
measuring filter.

For BS capable of multi-band operation where multiple bands are mapped
on the same antenna connector, the operating band unwanted emission
limits apply also in a supported operating band without any carrier
transmitted, in the case where there are carrier(s) transmitted in other
supported operating band(s). In this case where there is no carrier
transmitted in an operating band, the operating band unwanted emission
limit, as defined in the tables of the present clause for the largest
frequency offset (∆f~max~), of a band where there is no carrier
transmitted shall apply from 10 MHz below the lowest frequency, up to 10
MHz above the highest frequency of the supported downlink operating band
without any carrier transmitted. And no cumulative limit is applied in
the inter-band gap between a supported downlink operating band with
carrier(s) transmitted and a supported downlink operating band without
any carrier transmitted.

For a multicarrier E-UTRA BS or BS configured for intra-band contiguous
or non-contiguous carrier aggregation the definitions above apply to the
lower edge of the carrier transmitted at the lowest carrier frequency
and the upper edge of the carrier transmitted at the highest carrier
frequency within a specified frequency band.

In addition inside any sub-block gap for a BS operating in
non-contiguous spectrum, emissions shall not exceed the cumulative sum
of the minimum requirements specified for the adjacent sub blocks on
each side of the sub block gap. The minimum requirement for each sub
block is specified in Tables 6.6.3.1-1 to 6.6.3.3-3 below, where in this
case:

\- ∆f is the separation between the sub block edge frequency and the
nominal -3 dB point of the measuring filter closest to the sub block
edge.

\- f\_offset is the separation between the sub block edge frequency and
the centre of the measuring filter.

\- f\_offset~max~ is equal to the sub block gap bandwidth minus half of
the bandwidth of the measuring filter.

\- ∆f~max~ is equal to f\_offset~max~ minus half of the bandwidth of the
measuring filter.

For Wide Area BS, the requirements of either clause 6.6.3.1 (Category A
limits) or clause 6.6.3.2 (Category B limits) shall apply.

For Local Area BS, the requirements of clause 6.6.3.2A shall apply
(Category A and B).

For Home BS, the requirements of clause 6.6.3.2B shall apply (Category A
and B).

For Medium Range BS, the requirements in clause 6.6.3.2C shall apply
(Category A and B).

The application of either Category A or Category B limits shall be the
same as for Transmitter spurious emissions (Mandatory Requirements) in
clause 6.6.4.1.

The requirements of clauses 6.6.3.1 and 6.6.3.2 apply to Wide Area BS
that supports E-UTRA or E-UTRA with NB-IoT (in-band and/or guard band).
The requirements for Wide Area BS that supports NB-IoT standalone are in
clause 6.6.3.2E.

The requirements of clauses 6.6.3.2A apply to Local Area BS that
supports E-UTRA or E-UTRA with NB-IoT (in-band and/or guard band). The
requirements for Local Area BS that supports NB-IoT standalone are in
clause 6.6.3.2F.

The requirements of clauses 6.6.3.2B apply to Home BS that supports
E-UTRA or E-UTRA with NB-IoT (in-band and/or guard band). The
requirements for Home BS that supports NB-IoT standalone are in clause
6.6.3.2G.

The requirements of clauses 6.6.3.2C apply to Medium Range BS that
supports E-UTRA or E-UTRA with NB-IoT (in-band and/or guard band). The
requirements for Medium Range BS that supports NB-IoT standalone are in
clause 6.6.3.2H.

#### 6.6.3.1 Minimum requirements for Wide Area BS (Category A)

For E-UTRA BS operating in Bands 5, 6, 8, 12, 13, 14, 17, 18, 19, 26,
27, 28, 29, 31, 44, 68, 71, 72, 73, 85, 87, 88 emissions shall not
exceed the maximum levels specified in Tables 6.6.3.1‑1 to 6.6.3.1-3.

#### 6.6.3.3 Additional requirements

These requirements may be applied for the protection of other systems
operating inside or near each supported E-UTRA, E-UTRA with NB-IoT and
NB-IoT BS downlink operating band. The limits may apply as an optional
protection of such systems that are deployed in the same geographical
area as the E-UTRA, E-UTRA with NB-IoT and NB-IoT BS, or they may be set
by local or regional regulation as a mandatory requirement for an E-UTRA
operating band. It is in some cases not stated in the present document
whether a requirement is mandatory or under what exact circumstances
that a limit applies, since this is set by local or regional regulation.
An overview of regional requirements in the present document is given in
clause 4.3.

In certain regions the following requirement may apply. For E-UTRA,
E-UTRA with NB-IoT and NB-IoT BS operating in Bands 5, 26, 27 or 28,

dBm/MHz in each supported downlink operating band except in:

\- The frequency range from 10 MHz below the lower channel edge to the

In certain regions the following requirement may apply for protection of
DTT. For E-UTRA BS operating in Band 20, the level of emissions in the
band 470-790 MHz, measured in an 8MHz filter bandwidth on centre
frequencies F~filter~ according to Table 6.6.3.3-4, shall not exceed the
maximum emission level P~EM,N~ declared by the manufacturer. This
requirement applies in the frequency range 470-790 MHz even though part
of the range falls in the spurious domain.

Note: The regional requirement is defined in terms of EIRP (effective
isotropic radiated power), which is dependent on both the BS emissions
at the antenna connector and the deployment (including antenna gain and
feeder loss). The requirement defined above provides the characteristics
of the base station needed to verify compliance with the regional
requirement. Compliance with the regional requirement can be determined
using the method outlined in Annex G.

Table 6.6.3.3-5: Void

In regions where FCC regulation applies, requirements for protection of
GPS according to FCC Order DA 20-48 applies for operation in Band 24.
The following normative requirement covers the base station, to be used
together with other information about the site installation to verify
compliance with the requirement in FCC Order DA 20-48. The requirement
applies to BS operating in Band 24 to ensure that appropriate
interference protection is provided to the 1541 -- 1650 MHz band. This
requirement applies to the frequency range 1541-1650 MHz, even though
part of this range falls within the spurious domain.

The level of emissions in the 1541 -- 1650 MHz band, measured in
measurement bandwidth according to Table 6.6.3.3-6 shall not exceed the
maximum emission levels P~E~~M,B24,a,~ P~EM,B24,b~, P~EM,B24,c~,
P~EM,B24,d~, P~EM,B24,e~ and P~E~~M,B24,f~ declared by the manufacturer.

Note: The regional requirements in FCC Order DA 20-48 are defined in
terms of EIRP (effective isotropic radiated power), which is dependent
on both the BS emissions at the antenna connector and the deployment
(including antenna gain and feeder loss). The EIRP level is calculated
using: P~EIRP~ = P~E~ + G~ant~ where P~E~ denotes the BS unwanted
emission level at the antenna connector, G~ant~ equals the BS antenna
gain minus feeder loss. The requirement defined above provides the
characteristics of the base station needed to verify compliance with the
regional requirement.

Table 6.6.3.3-7: Void

In certain regions, the following requirements may apply to E-UTRA BS
operating in Band 32 within 1452-1492 MHz, in Band 75 within 1432-1517
MHz and in Band 76 within 1427-1432 MHz. The level of operating band
unwanted emissions, measured on centre frequencies f\_offset with filter

For Band 32, this requirement applies in the frequency range 1452-1492
MHz when non-Mobile/Fixed Communications Network (MFCN) services are
deployed in adjacent frequency ranges, while it applies also within
1427-1452 MHz and/or 1492-1517 MHz when MFCN services are deployed in
such frequency ranges, even though part of the ranges falls in the
spurious domain. For Band 75, this requirement applies in the frequency
range 1427-1517 MHz. For Band 76, this requirement applies in the
frequency range 1432-1517 MHz even though part of the range falls in the
spurious domain.

antenna connector and the deployment (including antenna gain and feeder
loss). The requirement defined above provides the characteristics of the
base station needed to verify compliance with the regional requirement.
The assessment of the EIRP level is described in Annex H.

In certain regions, the following requirement may apply to E-UTRA BS
operating in Band 32 within 1452-1492 MHz for the protection of non-MFCN
services in spectrum adjacent to the frequency range 1452-1492 MHz. The

The following notes are common to all clauses in 6.6.3:

NOTE 6: Local or regional regulations may specify another excluded
frequency range, which may include frequencies where synchronised E-UTRA
TDD systems operate.

NOTE 7: E-UTRA TDD base stations that are synchronized can transmit
without these additional co-existence requirements.

NOTE 8: As a general rule for the requirements in clause 6.6.3, the
resolution bandwidth of the measuring equipment should be equal to the
measurement bandwidth. However, to improve measurement accuracy,
sensitivity and efficiency, the resolution bandwidth may be smaller than
the measurement bandwidth. When the resolution bandwidth is smaller than
the measurement bandwidth, the result should be integrated over the
measurement bandwidth in order to obtain the equivalent noise bandwidth
of the measurement bandwidth.

NOTE 9: This frequency range ensures that the range of values of
f\_offset is continuous.

NOTE 10: The requirement is not applicable when ∆f~max~ \< 10 MHz.

NOTE 11: For Home BS, the parameter P is defined as the aggregated
maximum output power of all transmit antenna connectors of Home BS.

### 6.6.4 Transmitter spurious emissions

The transmitter spurious emission limits apply from 9 kHz to 12.75 GHz,
excluding the frequency range from 10 MHz below the lowest frequency of
the downlink operating band up to 10 MHz above the highest frequency of
the downlink operating band. For BS capable of multi-band operation
where multiple bands are mapped on the same antenna connector, this
exclusion applies for each supported operating band. For BS capable of
multi-band operation where multiple bands are mapped on separate antenna
connectors, the single-band requirements apply and the multi-band
exclusions and provisions are not applicable. Exceptions are the
requirements in Table 6.6.4.3.1-2, Table 6.6.4.3.1-3, and specifically
stated exceptions in Table 6.6.4.3.1-1 that apply also closer than
10 MHz from the downlink operating band and Table 6.6.4.3.1-1a that
applies inside the downlink operating band. For some operating bands the
upper frequency limit is higher than 12.75 GHz.

The requirements shall apply to BS that supports E-UTRA or E-UTRA with
NB-IoT in-band/guard band operation or NB-IoT standalone operation.

The requirements shall apply whatever the type of transmitter considered
(single carrier or multi-carrier). It applies for all transmission modes
foreseen by the manufacturer\'s specification. Unless otherwise stated,
all requirements are measured as mean power (RMS).

#### 6.6.4.1 Mandatory Requirements

The requirements of either clause 6.6.4.1.1 (Category A limits) or
clause 6.6.4.1.2 (Category B limits) shall apply. The application of
either Category A or Category B limits shall be the same as for
Operating band unwanted emissions in clause 6.6.3.

##### 6.6.4.1.1 Spurious emissions (Category A)

##### 6.6.4.1.1.1 Minimum Requirement {#minimum-requirement-7 .H6}

The power of any spurious emission shall not exceed the limits in Table

#### 6.6.4.2 Protection of the BS receiver of own or different BS

This requirement shall be applied for E-UTRA FDD operation in order to
prevent the receivers of the BSs being desensitised by emissions from a
BS transmitter. It is measured at the transmit antenna port for any type
of BS which has common or separate Tx/Rx antenna ports.

##### 6.6.4.2.1 Minimum Requirement

The power of any spurious emission shall not exceed the limits in Table
6.6.4.2-1.

#### 6.6.4.3 Additional spurious emissions requirements

These requirements may be applied for the protection of system operating
in frequency ranges other than the E-UTRA BS downlink operating band.
The limits may apply as an optional protection of such systems that are
deployed in the same geographical area as the E-UTRA BS, or they may be
set by local or regional regulation as a mandatory requirement for an
E-UTRA operating band. It is in some cases not stated in the present
document whether a requirement is mandatory or under what exact
circumstances that a limit applies, since this is set by local or
regional regulation. An overview of regional requirements in the present
document is given in clause 4.3.

Some requirements may apply for the protection of specific equipment
(UE, MS and/or BS) or equipment operating in specific systems (GSM,
CDMA, UTRA, E-UTRA, NR, etc.) as listed below.

##### 6.6.4.3.1 Minimum Requirement

The power of any spurious emission shall not exceed the limits of Table
6.6.4.3.1-1 for a BS where requirements for co-existence with the system
listed in the first column apply. For BS capable of multi-band
operation, the exclusions and conditions in the Note column of Table
6.6.4.3.1-1 apply for each supported operating band. For BS capable of
multi-band operation where multiple bands are mapped on separate antenna
connectors, the exclusions and conditions in the Note column of Table
6.6.4.3.1-1 apply for the operating band supported at that antenna
connector.

  E-UTRA Band 46c                                                                 5470 - 5725 MHz                                -40 dBm         1 MHz                   This is only applicable to E-UTRA BS operating in Band 46a or 46b.
  E-UTRA Band 46d                                                                 5725 - 5925 MHz                                -40 dBm         1 MHz                   This is only applicable to E-UTRA BS operating in Band 46a or 46b.
  NOTE 1: This requirement may apply to E-UTRA BS operating in certain regions.                                                                                          

NOTE 1: As defined in the scope for spurious emissions in this clause,
except for the cases where the noted requirements apply to a BS
operating in Band 25, Band 27, Band 28 or Band 29, the co-existence
requirements in Table 6.6.4.3.1-1 do not apply for the 10 MHz frequency
range immediately outside the downlink operating band (see Table 5.5-1).
Emission limits for this excluded frequency range may be covered by
local or regional requirements.

NOTE 2: Table 6.6.4.3.1-1 assumes that two operating bands, where the
frequency ranges in Table 5.5-1 would be overlapping, are not deployed
in the same geographical area. For such a case of operation with
overlapping frequency arrangements in the same geographical area,
special co-existence requirements may apply that are not covered by the
3GPP specifications.

NOTE 3: TDD base stations deployed in the same geographical area, that
are synchronized and use the same or adjacent operating bands can
transmit without additional co-existence requirements. For
unsynchronized base stations (except in Band 46), special co-existence
requirements may apply that are not covered by the 3GPP specifications.

NOTE 5: For E-UTRA Band 28 BS, specific solutions may be required to
fulfil the spurious emissions limits for E-UTRA BS for co-existence with
E-UTRA Band 27 UL operating band.

NOTE 6: For E-UTRA Band 29 BS, specific solutions may be required to
fulfil the spurious emissions limits for E-UTRA BS for co-existence with
UTRA Band XII or E-UTRA Band 12 UL operating band, E-UTRA Band 17 UL
operating band or E-UTRA Band 85 UL operating band.

The power of any spurious emission shall not exceed the limits of Table
6.6.4.3.1-1A for a Home BS where requirements for co-existence with a
Home BS type listed in the first column apply.

NOTE 1: As defined in the scope for spurious emissions in this clause,
except for the cases where the noted requirements apply to a BS
operating in Band 27, Band 28 or Band 29, the coexistence requirements
in Table 6.6.4.3.1-1A do not apply for the 10 MHz frequency range
immediately outside the Home BS transmit frequency range of a downlink
operating band (see Table 5.5-1). Emission limits for this excluded
frequency range may be covered by local or regional requirements.

NOTE 2: Table 6.6.4.3.1-1A assumes that two operating bands, where the
frequency ranges in Table 5.5-1 would be overlapping, are not deployed
in the same geographical area. For such a case of operation with
overlapping frequency arrangements in the same geographical area,
special co-existence requirements may apply that are not covered by the
3GPP specifications.

NOTE 3: TDD base stations deployed in the same geographical area, that
are synchronized and use the same or adjacent operating bands can
transmit without additional co-existence requirements. For
unsynchronized base stations, special co-existence requirements may
apply that are not covered by the 3GPP specifications.

NOTE 4: For E-UTRA Band 28 BS, specific solutions may be required to
fulfil the spurious emissions limits for E-UTRA BS for co-existence with
E-UTRA Band 27 UL operating band.

NOTE 5: For E-UTRA Band 29 BS, specific solutions may be required to
fulfil the spurious emissions limits for E-UTRA BS for co-existence with
UTRA Band XII or E-UTRA Band 12 UL operating band, E-UTRA Band 17 UL
operating band or E-UTRA Band 85 UL operating band.

The following requirement may be applied for the protection of PHS. This
requirement is also applicable at specified frequencies falling between
10 MHz below the lowest BS transmitter frequency of the downlink
operating band and 10 MHz above the highest BS transmitter frequency of
the downlink operating band.

The power of any spurious emission shall not exceed:

The following requirement shall be applied to BS operating in Bands 13
and 14 to ensure that appropriate interference protection is provided to
700 MHz public safety operations. This requirement is also applicable at
the frequency range from 10 MHz below the lowest frequency of the BS
downlink operating band up to 10 MHz above the highest frequency of the
BS downlink operating band.

The following requirement shall be applied to BS operating in Band 26 to
ensure that appropriate interference protection is provided to 800 MHz
public safety operations. This requirement is also applicable at the
frequency range from 10 MHz below the lowest frequency of the BS
downlink operating band up to 10 MHz above the highest frequency of the
BS downlink operating band.

  NOTE: This requirement applies for 10 or 20 MHz E-UTRA carriers allocated within 2545-2645 MHz.                                           

The following requirement may apply to E-UTRA BS operating in Band 30 in
certain regions. This requirement is also applicable at the frequency
range from 10 MHz below the lowest frequency of the BS downlink
operating band up to 10 MHz above the highest frequency of the BS
downlink operating band.

The power of any spurious emission shall not exceed:

  2370MHz -- 2395MHz     -45dBm          1 MHz                   

In addition for Band 46 operation, the BS may have to comply with the
applicable spurious emission limits established regionally, when
deployed in regions where those limits apply and under the conditions
declared by the manufacturer. The regional requirements may be in the
form of conducted power, power spectral density, EIRP and other types of
limits. In case of regulatory limits based on EIRP, assessment of the
EIRP level is described in Annex H.

The following requirement may apply to E-UTRA BS operating in Band 48
and Band 49 in certain regions. The power of any spurious emission shall
not exceed:

#### 6.6.4.4 Co-location with other base stations

These requirements may be applied for the protection of other BS
receivers when GSM900, DCS1800, PCS1900, GSM850, CDMA850, UTRA FDD, UTRA
TDD, E-UTRA and/or NR BS are co-located with an E-UTRA BS.

The requirements assume a 30 dB coupling loss between transmitter and
receiver and are based on co-location with base stations of the same
class.

##### 6.6.4.4.1 Minimum Requirement

The power of any spurious emission shall not exceed the limits of Table
6.6.4.4.1-1 for a Wide Area BS where requirements for co-location with a
BS type listed in the first column apply. For BS capable of multi-band
operation, the exclusions and conditions in the Note column of Table
6.6.4.4.1-1 apply for each supported operating band. For BS capable of
multi-band operation where multiple bands are mapped on separate antenna
connectors, the exclusions and conditions in the Note column of Table
6.6.4.4.1-1 apply for the operating band supported at that antenna
connector.

The power of any spurious emission shall not exceed the limits of Table
6.6.4.4.1-2 for a Local Area BS where requirements for co-location with
a BS type listed in the first column apply. For BS capable of multi-band
operation, the exclusions and conditions in the Note column of Table
6.6.4.4.1-2 apply for each supported operating band. For BS capable of
multi-band operation where multiple bands are mapped on separate antenna
connectors, the exclusions and conditions in the Note column of Table
6.6.4.4.1-2 apply for the operating band supported at that antenna
connector.

The power of any spurious emission shall not exceed the limits of Table
6.6.4.4.1-3 for a Medium Range BS where requirements for co-location
with a BS type listed in the first column apply. For BS capable of
multi-band operation, the exclusions and conditions in the Note column
of Table 6.6.4.4.1-3 apply for each supported operating band. For BS
capable of multi-band operation where multiple bands are mapped on
separate antenna connectors, the exclusions and conditions in the Note
column of Table 6.6.4.4.1-3 apply for the operating band supported at
that antenna connector.

NOTE 1: As defined in the scope for spurious emissions in this clause,
the co-location requirements in Table 6.6.4.4.1-1 to Table 6.6.4.4.1-3
do not apply for the 10 MHz frequency range immediately outside the BS
transmit frequency range of a downlink operating band (see Table 5.5-1).
The current state-of-the-art technology does not allow a single generic
solution for co-location with other system on adjacent frequencies for
30dB BS-BS minimum coupling loss. However, there are certain
site-engineering solutions that can be used. These techniques are
addressed in TR 25.942 \[8\].

NOTE 2: Table 6.6.4.4.1-1 to Table 6.6.4.4.1-3 assume that two operating
bands, where the corresponding BS transmit and receive frequency ranges
in Table 5.5-1 would be overlapping, are not deployed in the same
geographical area. For such a case of operation with overlapping
frequency arrangements in the same geographical area, special
co-location requirements may apply that are not covered by the 3GPP
specifications.

NOTE 3: Co-located TDD base stations that are synchronized and using the
same or adjacent operating band can transmit without special
co-locations requirements. For unsynchronized base stations (except in
Band 46), special co-location requirements may apply that are not
covered by the 3GPP specifications.

6.7 Transmitter intermodulation
-------------------------------

The transmit intermodulation requirement is a measure of the capability
of the transmitter to inhibit the generation of signals in its non
linear elements caused by presence of the wanted signal and an
interfering signal reaching the transmitter via the antenna. The
requirement applies during the transmitter ON period and the transmitter
transient period.

For BS capable of multi-band operation where multiple bands are mapped
on separate antenna connectors, the single-band requirements apply
regardless of the interfering signals position relative to the Inter RF
Bandwidth gap.

### 6.7.1 Minimum requirement

The transmitter intermodulation level is the power of the
intermodulation products when an E-UTRA signal of channel bandwidth 5
MHz as an interfering signal is injected into the antenna connector.

The transmitter intermodulation level shall not exceed the unwanted
emission limits in clauses 6.6.2, 6.6.3 and 6.6.4 in the presence of an
E-UTRA interfering signal according to Table 6.7.1-1, Table 6.7.1-2 and
Table 6.7.1-3.

The requirement is applicable outside the Base Station RF Bandwidth or
Radio Bandwidth. The interfering signal offset is defined relative to
the Base Station RF Bandwidth edges or Radio Bandwidth edges.

For a BS operating in non-contiguous spectrum, the requirement is also
applicable inside a sub-block gap for interfering signal offsets where
the interfering signal falls completely within the sub-block gap. The
interfering signal offset is defined relative to the sub-block edges.

For a BS capable of multi-band operation, the requirement applies
relative to the Base Station RF Bandwidth edges of each supported
operating band. In case the Inter RF Bandwidth gap is less than 15 MHz,
the requirement in the gap applies only for interfering signal offsets
where the interfering signal falls completely within the Inter RF
Bandwidth gap.

For E-UTRA, the wanted signal and interfering signal centre frequency
offset shall be as in Table 6.7.1-1.

intermodulation requirement for E-UTRA

### 6.7.2 Additional requirement for Band 41

In certain regions the following requirement may apply. For E-UTRA BS
operating in Band 41, the transmitter intermodulation level shall not
exceed the maximum levels specified in Table 6.6.2.1-2 with a square
filter in the first adjacent channel, and Table 6.6.4.3.1-6 in the

7 Receiver characteristics
==========================

7.1 General
-----------

The requirements in clause 7 are expressed for a single receiver antenna
connector. For receivers with antenna diversity, the requirements apply
for each receiver antenna connector.

Unless otherwise stated, the receiver characteristics are specified at
the BS antenna connector (test port A) with a full complement of
transceivers for the configuration in normal operating conditions. For
FDD operation the requirements in clause 7 shall be met with the
transmitter(s) on. If any external apparatus such as a RX amplifier, a
filter or the combination of such devices is used, requirements apply at
the far end antenna connector (port B).

NOTE: In normal operating conditions the BS in FDD operation is
configured to transmit and receive at the same time. The transmitter may
be off for some of the tests as specifed in 36.141 \[4\].

Unless otherwise stated the requirements in clause 7 apply during the
base station receive period.

![](media/image61.wmf){width="6.166666666666667in" height="1.75in"}

Figure 7.1: Receiver test ports

The throughput requirements defined for the receiver characteristics in
this clause do not assume HARQ retransmissions.

When the BS is configured to receive multiple carriers, all the
throughput requirements are applicable for each received carrier. For
ACS, blocking and intermodulation characteristics, the negative offsets
of the interfering signal apply relative to the lower Base Station RF
Bandwidth edge and positive offsets of the interfering signal apply
relative to the upper Base Station RF Bandwidth edge.

NOTE: Requirements may only be supported for certain frequency ranges
within the operating band(s). These frequency ranges could be different
for NB.-IoT comparing to E-UTRA.

NOTE: For E-UTRA BS with NB-IoT (in band and/or guard band) or
standalone NB-IoT BS, requirements are defined for 15 kHz sub-carrier
spacing and 3.75 kHz sub-carrier spacing. A NB-IoT Base Station supports
15 kHz sub-carrier spacing, 3.75 kHz sub-carrier spacing, or both.

7.2 Reference sensitivity level
-------------------------------

The reference sensitivity power level P~REFSENS~ is the minimum mean
power received at the antenna connector at which a throughput
requirement shall be met for a specified reference measurement channel.

### 7.2.1 Minimum requirement

For E-UTRA, the throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of
the reference measurement channel as specified in Annex A with
parameters specified in Table 7.2.1-1 for Wide Area BS, in Table 7.2.1-2
for Local Area BS, in Table 7.2.1-3 for Home BS and in Table 7.2.1-4 for
Medium Range BS.

7.3 Dynamic range
-----------------

The dynamic range is specified as a measure of the capability of the
receiver to receive a wanted signal in the presence of an interfering
signal inside the received channel bandwidth. In this condition a
throughput requirement shall be met for a specified reference
measurement channel. The interfering signal for the dynamic range
requirement is an AWGN signal.

### 7.3.1 Minimum requirement

For E-UTRA, the throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of
the reference measurement channel as specified in Annex A with
parameters specified in Table 7.3.1-1 for Wide Area BS, in Table 7.3.1-2
for Local Area BS, in Table 7.3.1-3 for Home BS **and in Table 7.3.1-4
for Medium Range BS**.

7.4 In-channel selectivity
--------------------------

In-channel selectivity (ICS) is a measure of the receiver ability to
receive a wanted signal at its assigned resource block locations in the
presence of an interfering signal received at a larger power spectral
density. In this condition a throughput requirement shall be met for a
specified reference measurement channel. The interfering signal shall be
an E-UTRA signal as specified in Annex C and shall be time aligned with
the wanted signal.

### 7.4.1 Minimum requirement

For E-UTRA, the throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of
the reference measurement channel as specified in Annex A with
parameters specified in Table 7.4.1-1 for Wide Area BS, in Table 7.4.1-2
for Local Area BS, in Table 7.4.1-3 for Home BS and in Table 7.4.1-4 for
Medium Range BS.

7.6 Blocking
------------

### 7.6.1 General blocking requirement

The blocking characteristics is a measure of the receiver ability to
receive a wanted signal at its assigned channel in the presence of an
unwanted interferer, which are either a 1.4MHz, 3MHz or 5MHz E-UTRA
signal for in-band blocking or a CW signal for out-of-band blocking. The
interfering signal shall be an E-UTRA signal as specified in Annex C.

#### 7.6.1.1 Minimum requirement

For E-UTRA, the throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of
the reference measurement channel, with a wanted and an interfering
signal coupled to BS antenna input using the parameters in Tables
7.6.1.1-1, 7.6.1.1-1a, 7.6.1.1-1b, 7.6.1.1-1c and 7.6.1.1-2. The
reference measurement channel for the wanted signal is identified in
Table 7.2.1-1, 7.2.1-2, 7.2.1-3 and 7.2.1-4 for each channel bandwidth
and further specified in Annex A.

The blocking requirement is applicable outside the Base Station RF
Bandwidth or Radio Bandwidth. The interfering signal offset is defined
relative to the Base Station RF Bandwidth edges or Radio Bandwidth
edges.

For a BS operating in non-contiguous spectrum within any operating band,
the blocking requirement applies in addition inside any sub-block gap,
in case the sub-block gap size is at least as wide as twice the
interfering signal minimum offset in Table 7.6.1.1-2. The interfering
signal offset is defined relative to the sub-block edges inside the
sub-block gap.

For a BS capable of multi-band operation, the requirement in the in-band
blocking frequency ranges applies for each supported operating band. The
requirement applies in addition inside any Inter RF Bandwidth gap, in
case the Inter RF Bandwidth gap size is at least as wide as twice the
interfering signal minimum offset in Table 7.6.1.1-2.

For a BS capable of multi-band operation, the requirement in the
out-of-band blocking frequency ranges apply for each operating band,
with the exception that the in-band blocking frequency ranges of all
supported operating bands according to Tables 7.6.1.1-1, 7.6.1.1-1a and
7.6.1.1-1c shall be excluded from the out-of-band blocking requirement.

E-UTRA

For NB-IoT standalone operation, the throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the
maximum throughput of the reference measurement channel, with a wanted
and an interfering signal coupled to BS antenna input using the
parameters in Tables 7.6.1.1-3, 7.6.1.1-3a, 7.6.1.1-3b, 7.6.1.1-3c and
7.6.1.1-4. The reference measurement channel for the wanted signal is
identified in Table 7.2.1-5, 7.2.1-5a, 7.2.1-5b and 7.2.1-5c and further
specified in Annex A.

The blocking requirement is applicable outside the Base Station RF
Bandwidth or Radio Bandwidth. The interfering signal offset is defined
relative to the Base Station RF Bandwidth edges or Radio Bandwidth
edges.

NOTE: Tables 7.6.1.1-3, 7.6.1.1-3a, 7.6.1.1-3b and 7.6.1.1-3c assumes
that two operating bands, where the downlink operating band (see Table
5.5-1) of one band would be within the in-band blocking region of the
other band, are not deployed in the same geographical area.

Table 7.6.1.1-4: Interfering signals for blocking performance
requirement for NB-IoT standalone operation

  NB-IoT channel BW of the lowest/highest carrier received \[MHz\]   Interfering signal centre frequency minimum offset to the lower/upper Base Station RF Bandwidth edge or sub-block edge inside a sub-block gap \[MHz\]   Type of interfering signal
  ------------------------------------------------------------------ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------
  0.2                                                                ±7.5                                                                                                                                                    5MHz E-UTRA signal

For E-UTRA with NB-IoT in-band/guard band operation, the throughput
shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference measurement
channel, with a wanted and an interfering signal coupled to BS antenna
input using the parameters in Tables 7.6.1.1-5, 7.6.1.1-5a, 7.6.1.1-5b,
7.6.1.1-5c and 7.6.1.1-6. The reference measurement channel for the
wanted signal is identified in Table 7.2.1-1, 7.2.1-2, 7.2.1-3 and
7.2.1-4 for each channel bandwidth for E-UTRA, Table 7.2.1-5, 7.2.1-5a,
7.2.1-5b and 7.2.1-5c for NB-IoT and further specified in Annex A.

The blocking requirement is applicable outside the Base Station RF
Bandwidth or Radio Bandwidth. The interfering signal offset is defined
relative to the Base Station RF Bandwidth edges or Radio Bandwidth
edges.

E-UTRA with NB-IoT in-band/guard band operation

### 7.6.2 Co-location with other base stations

This additional blocking requirement may be applied for the protection
of E-UTRA and NB-IoT BS receivers when GSM, CDMA, UTRA, E-UTRA, NR or
NB-IoT BS operating in a different frequency band are co-located with an
E-UTRA or NB-IoT BS. The requirement is applicable to all channel
bandwidths supported by the E-UTRA BS and E-UTRA with NB-IoT
in-band/guard band operation.

The requirements in this clause assume a 30 dB coupling loss between
interfering transmitter and E-UTRA or NB-IoT BS receiver and are based
on co-location with base stations of the same class.

#### 7.6.2.1 Minimum requirement

The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference
measurement channel, with a wanted and an interfering signal coupled to
BS antenna input using the parameters in Table 7.6.2.1-1 for Wide Area
BS, in Table 7.6.2.1-2 for Local Area BS and in Table 7.6.2.1-3 for
Medium Range BS. The reference measurement channel for the wanted signal
is identified in Tables 7.2.1-1, 7.2.1-2 and 7.2.1-4 for each channel
bandwidth for E-UTRA, Table 7.2.1-5 for NB-IoT and further specified in
Annex A.

Wide Area BS when co-located with BS in other frequency bands.

### 7.6.3 Additional requirement (regional)

For the Public Safety LTE BS in Korea from 718 to 728 MHz in band 28,
the wanted and the interfering signal coupled to the BS antenna input
are specified in Tables G-2.2, G-2.3, G-2.4 and G-2.5 for the blocking
requirements. The reference measurement channel for the wanted signal is
A.1-3 for 10 MHz channel bandwidth and further specified in Annex A.

7.7 Receiver spurious emissions
-------------------------------

The spurious emissions power is the power of emissions generated or
amplified in a receiver that appear at the BS receiver antenna
connector. The requirements apply to all BS with separate RX and TX
antenna ports. In this case for FDD BS the test shall be performed when
both TX and RX are on, with the TX port terminated.

For TDD BS with common RX and TX antenna port the requirement applies
during the Transmitter OFF period. For FDD BS with common RX and TX
antenna port the transmitter spurious emission as specified in clause
6.6.4 is valid.

For BS capable of multi-band operation where multiple bands are mapped
on separate antenna connectors, the single-band requirements apply and
the excluded frequency range is only applicable for the operating band
supported on each antenna connector.

The requirements shall apply to BS that supports E-UTRA or E-UTRA with
NB-IoT in-band/guard band operation or NB-IoT standalone operation.

### 7.7.1 Minimum requirement

The power of any spurious emission shall not exceed the levels in Table
7.7.1-1:

  NOTE: The frequency range between 2.5 \* BW~Channel~ below the first carrier frequency and 2.5 \* BW~Channel~ above the last carrier frequency transmitted by the BS, where BW~Channel~ is the channel bandwidth according to Table 5.6‑1, may be excluded from the requirement. However, frequencies that are more than 10 MHz below the lowest frequency of any of the BS supported downlink operating band or more than 10 MHz above the highest frequency of any of the BS supported downlink operating band shall not be excluded from the requirement. For BS capable of multiband operation, the exclusion applies for all supported operating bands. For BS capable of multi-band operation where multiple bands are mapped on separate antenna connectors, the single-band requirements apply and the excluded frequency range is only applicable for the operating band supported on each antenna connector.                                           

In addition to the requirements in Table 7.7.1-1, the power of any
spurious emission shall not exceed the levels specified for Protection
of the E-UTRA FDD BS receiver of own or different BS in clause 6.6.4.2
and for Co-existence with other systems in the same geographical area in
clause 6.6.4.3. In addition, the co-existence requirements for
co-located base stations specified in clause 6.6.4.4 may also be
applied.

7.8 Receiver intermodulation
----------------------------

Third and higher order mixing of the two interfering RF signals can
produce an interfering signal in the band of the desired channel.
Intermodulation response rejection is a measure of the capability of the
receiver to receive a wanted signal on its assigned channel frequency in
the presence of two interfering signals which have a specific frequency
relationship to the wanted signal. Interfering signals shall be a CW
signal and an E-UTRA signal as specified in Annex C.

### 7.8.1 Minimum requirement

For E-UTRA, the throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of
the reference measurement channel, with a wanted signal at the assigned
channel frequency and two interfering signals coupled to the BS antenna
input, with the conditions specified in Tables 7.8.1-1 and 7.8.1-2 for
intermodulation performance and in Tables 7.8.1-3, 7.8.1-4, 7.8.1-5 and
7.8.1-6 for narrowband intermodulation performance. Narrowband
intermodulation requirements are not applied for Band 46. The reference
measurement channel for the wanted signal is identified in
Table 7.2.1-1, Table 7.2.1-2, Table 7.2.1-3 and Table 7.2.1-4 for each
channel bandwidth and further specified in Annex A.

For NB-IoT in-band operation, the throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the
maximum throughput of the reference measurement channel, with a wanted
signal at the assigned channel frequency and two interfering signals
coupled to the BS antenna input, with the conditions specified in Tables
7.8.1-1a and 7.8.1-2 for intermodulation performance and in Tables
7.8.1-3a, 7.8.1-4a, 7.8.1-5a and 7.8.1-6a for narrowband intermodulation
performance. The reference measurement channel for the wanted signal is
identified in Tables 7.2.1-5, 7.2.1-5a, 7.2.1-5b and 7.2.1-5c and
further specified in Annex A.

For NB-IoT guard band operation, the throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the
maximum throughput of the reference measurement channel, with a wanted
signal at the assigned channel frequency and two interfering signals
coupled to the BS antenna input, with the conditions specified in Tables
7.8.1-1b and 7.8.1-2 for intermodulation performance and in Tables
7.8.1-3b, 7.8.1-4b, 7.8.1-5b and 7.8.1-6b for narrowband intermodulation
performance. The reference measurement channel for the wanted signal is
identified in Tables 7.2.1-5, 7.2.1-5a, 7.2.1-5b and 7.2.1-5c and
further specified in Annex A.

For NB-IoT standalone operation, the throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the
maximum throughput of the reference measurement channel, with a wanted
signal at the assigned channel frequency and two interfering signals
coupled to the BS antenna input, with the conditions specified in Tables
7.8.1-1c and 7.8.1-2a for intermodulation performance and in Tables
7.8.1-3c, 7.8.1-4c, 7.8.1-5c and 7.8.1-6c for narrowband intermodulation
performance. The reference measurement channel for the wanted signal is
identified in Tables 7.2.1-5, 7.2.1-5a and 7.2.1-5c and further
specified in Annex A.

The receiver intermodulation requirement is applicable outside the Base
Station RF Bandwidth or Radio Bandwidth edges. The interfering signal
offset is defined relative to the Base Station RF Bandwidth edges or
Radio Bandwidth edges.

For a BS operating in non-contiguous spectrum within any operating band,
the narrowband intermodulation requirement applies in addition inside
any sub-block gap in case the sub-block gap is at least as wide as the
channel bandwidth of the E-UTRA interfering signal in Table 7.8.1-3. The
interfering signal offset is defined relative to the sub-block edges
inside the sub-block gap.

For a BS capable of multi-band operation, the intermodulation
requirement applies in addition inside any Inter RF Bandwidth gap, in
case the gap size is at least twice as wide as the E-UTRA interfering
signal centre frequency offset from the Base Station RF Bandwidth edge.

For a BS capable of multi-band operation, the narrowband intermodulation
requirement applies in addition inside any Inter RF Bandwidth gap in
case the gap size is at least as wide as the E-UTRA interfering signal
in Tables 7.8.1-3, 7.8.1-4 and 7.8.1-6. The interfering signal offset is
defined relative to the Base Station RF Bandwidth edges inside the Inter
RF Bandwidth gap.

8 Performance requirement
=========================

8.1 General
-----------

Performance requirements for the BS are specified for the fixed
reference channels defined in Annex A and the propagation conditions in
Annex B. The requirements only apply to those FRCs that are supported by
the base station.

Unless stated otherwise, performance requirements apply for a single
carrier only. Performance requirements for a BS supporting carrier
aggregation are defined in terms of single carrier requirements. For FDD
operation the requirements in clause 8 shall be met with the
transmitter(s) on.

NOTE: In normal operating conditions the BS in FDD operation is
configured to transmit and receive at the same time. The transmitter may
be off for some of the tests as specifed in 36.141 \[4\].

The SNR used in this clause is specified based on a single carrier and
defined as:

SNR = S / N

Where:

S is the total signal energy in the subframe on a single antenna port.

> N is the noise energy in a bandwidth corresponding to the transmission
> bandwidth over the duration of a subframe.

For enhanced performance requirements type A and type B, the SINR used
in this clause is specified based on a single carrier and defined as:

Where:

is the total signal energy of one intra-cell UE in the subframe on a
single antenna port.

> is the summation of the received energy of the strongest inter-cell
> interferers explicitly defined in a test procedure plus the white
> noise energy *N*, in a bandwidth corresponding to the transmission
> bandwidth over the duration of a subframe on a single antenna port.
> The respective energy of each inter-cell interferer relative to is
> defined by its associated DIP value.

8.2 Performance requirements for PUSCH
--------------------------------------

### 8.2.1 Requirements in multipath fading propagation conditions

The performance requirement of PUSCH is determined by a minimum required
throughput for a given SNR. The required throughput is expressed as a
fraction of maximum throughput for the FRCs listed in Annex A. The
performance requirements assume HARQ retransmissions. For 2Tx test the
HARQ retransmissions for two codewords are independent. The requirements
defined based on FRC in Annex A.17 apply to the BS supporting PUSCH with
256QAM. The requirements defined based on FRC in Annex A.18 apply to the
BS supporting PUSCH transmission in UpPTS. The requirements defined
based on FRC in Annex A.19 apply to the BS supporting both PUSCH
transmission in UpPTS and PUSCH with 256QAM. For PUSCH transmission in
UpPTS, the special subframe configuration is 10 as specified in 36.211
\[10\] Table 4.2-1, and during the test only special subframe is
scheduled.

Table 8.2.1-1 Test parameters for testing PUSCH

  Parameter                              Value
  -------------------------------------- ------------------------
  Maximum number of HARQ transmissions   4
  RV sequence                            0, 2, 3, 1, 0, 2, 3, 1
  Uplink-downlink allocation for TDD     Configuration 1 (2:2)

#### 8.2.1.1 Minimum requirements

The throughput shall be equal to or larger than the fraction of maximum
throughput stated in the tables 8.2.1.1-1 to 8.2.1.1-6 at the given SNR
for 1Tx and in tables 8.2.1.1-7 to 8.2.1.1-12 for 2Tx two layer spatial
multiplexing transmission.

### 8.2.2 Requirements for UL timing adjustment

The performance requirement of UL timing adjustment is determined by a
minimum required throughput for the moving UE at given SNR. The
performance requirements assume HARQ retransmissions. The performance
requirements for UL timing adjustment scenario 2 defined in Annex B.4
are optional.

In the tests for UL timing adjustment, two signals are configured, one
being transmitted by a moving UE and the other being transmitted by a
stationary UE. The transmission of SRS from UE is optional. FRC
parameters in Table A.7-1 and Table A.8-1 are applied for both UEs. The
received power for both UEs is the same. The resource blocks allocated
for both UEs are consecutive. In Scenario 2, Doppler shift is not taken
into account.

This requirement shall not be applied to Local Area BS and Home BS.

### 8.2.3 Requirements for high speed train

The performance requirement of PUSCH for high speed train is determined
by a minimum required throughput for a given SNR. The required
throughput is expressed as a fraction of maximum throughput for the FRCs
listed in Annex A. The performance requirements assume HARQ
retransmissions. The performance requirements for high speed train are
optional.

This requirement shall not be applied to Local Area BS and Home BS.

### 8.2.4 Requirements for HARQ-ACK multiplexed on PUSCH

Two performance requirements are defined for HARQ-ACK multiplexed on
PUSCH: ACK false detection and ACK missed detection requirements.

The ACK false detection probability for PUSCH is the probability that
ACK is detected when data only is sent on symbols where HARQ-ACK
information can be allocated (i.e. by puncturing data).

The ACK missed detection probability for HARQ-ACK multiplexed on PUSCH
is the conditional probability of not detecting an ACK when it was sent
on PUSCH resources.

In the tests for ACK missed detection on PUSCH, data is punctured by the
control information (i.e. ACK/NACK) in both slots within subframe on
symbols as specified in 36.212.

In both tests none of CQI, RI nor SRS is transmitted. Tests are to be
performed for one bit HARQ-ACK information (O = 1).

#### 8.2.4.1 Minimum requirement

The ACK false detection probability as well as the ACK missed detection
probability for HARQ-ACK multiplexed on PUSCH shall not exceed 1% at
PUSCH power settings presented in table 8.2.4.1-1.

enhanced HARQ pattern, as specified in 36.213 \[11\] clause 8 and 8.0,
is determined by residual block error probability (BLER) after HARQ
retransmission. The performance is measured by the required SNR at
residual BLER of 2% for the FRCs listed in Annex A.11. The residual BLER
is defined as follows:

where:

\- A is the number of incorrectly decoded transport blocks after HARQ
retransmission.

\- B is the number of transmitted transport blocks (retransmitted
transport blocks are not counted repetitively).

The requirement is applicable for FDD. TTI bundling and enhanced HARQ
pattern are enabled in the tests.

### 8.2.6 Enhanced performance requirement type A in multipath fading propagation conditions with synchronous interference

The enhanced performance requirement type A of PUSCH is determined by a
minimum required throughput for a given SINR. The required throughput is
expressed as a fraction of maximum throughput for the FRCs listed in
Annex A. The performance requirements assume HARQ retransmissions.

The purpose is to verify the demodulation performance when the wanted
PUSCH signal in the serving cell is interfered by PUSCH of one or two
dominant interferer(s) applying the interference model defined in clause
B.6.2.

The requirements apply to the BS supporting the enhanced performance
requirements type A.

The requirements apply to the BS receiving the synchronous interference
i.e., the interference is time-synchronous with the tested signal.

### 8.2.6A Enhanced performance requirement type A in multipath fading propagation conditions with asynchronous interference

The enhanced performance requirement type A of PUSCH is determined by a
minimum required throughput for a given SINR. The required throughput is
expressed as a fraction of maximum throughput for the FRCs listed in
Annex A. The performance requirements assume HARQ retransmissions.

The purpose is to verify the demodulation performance when the wanted
PUSCH signal in the serving cell is interfered by PUSCH of two
interferers from the same interfering cell, applying the interference
model defined in clause B.6.3.

The requirements apply to the BS supporting the enhanced performance
requirements type A.

The requirements apply to the BS receiving the asynchronous interference
i.e., the interference is time-asynchronous with the tested signal.

### 8.2.9 Enhanced performance requirement type B in multipath fading propagation conditions

The purpose is to verify the demodulation performance when there are
multiple co-scheduled intra-cell UEs in the serving cell and one
inter-cell interfering UE in the negiboring cell. The PUSCH of all the
intra-cell UEs are wanted signal for the BS.

The enhanced performance requirement type B of PUSCH is determined by a
minimum required throughput for a given SINR. The required throughput is
expressed as a fraction of maximum sum throughput of all the intra-cell
UEs for the FRCs listed in Annex A. The performance requirements assume
HARQ retransmissions.

The requirements apply to the BS supporting the enhanced performance
requirements type B.

8.3 Performance requirements for PUCCH
--------------------------------------

### 8.3.1 DTX to ACK performance

The DTX to ACK requirement is valid for any number of receive antennas,
for all frame structures and for any channel bandwidth.

The DTX to ACK probability for multi user PUCCH case denotes the
probability that ACK is detected when nothing is sent on the wanted
signal and the interfering signals are present.

#### 8.3.1.1 Minimum requirement

The DTX to ACK probability, i.e. the probability that ACK is detected
when nothing was sent, shall not exceed 1%, where the performance
measure definition is as follows:

![](media/image71.wmf){width="4.65625in" height="0.3958333333333333in"},

where:

● \#(false ACK bits) denotes the number of detected ACK bits.

● \#(ACK/NACK bits) denotes the number of encoded bits per sub-frame

● \#(PUCCH DTX) denotes the number of DTX occasions

### 8.3.2 ACK missed detection requirements for single user PUCCH format 1a

The ACK missed detection probability is the probability of not detecting
an ACK when an ACK was sent.

ACK/NACK repetitions are disabled for PUCCH transmission.

Test parameters for PUCCH transmission on two antenna ports are
presented in Annex A.10.

#### 8.3.2.1 Minimum requirements

The ACK missed detection probability shall not exceed 1% at the SNR
given in table 8.3.2.1-1 for 1Tx and in table 8.3.2.1-2 for 2Tx case.

### 8.3.6 ACK missed detection requirements for PUCCH format 3

The ACK missed detection probability is the probability of not detecting
an ACK bit when an ACK bit was sent on the particular bit position, with
each missed ACK bit being accounted as one error.

The number of encoded ACK/NACK bits per sub-frame is defined for two
cases as presented below:

● 4AN bits: applicable for FDD and TDD

● 16AN bits : applicable for TDD

ACK/NACK repetitions are disabled for PUCCH transmission. Random
codeword selection is assumed.

#### 8.3.6.1 Minimum requirements

The ACK missed detection probability shall not exceed 1% at the SNR
given in table 8.3.6.1-1 and table 8.3.6.1‑2, for 4 and 16 AN bits per
sub-frame, respectively.

### 8.3.7 NACK to ACK requirements for PUCCH format 3

The NACK to ACK detection probability is the probability that an ACK bit
is falsely detected when an NACK bit was sent on the particular bit
position, where the NACK to ACK detection probability is defined as
follows:

![](media/image72.wmf){width="4.166666666666667in"
height="0.3854166666666667in"},

where:

● ![](media/image73.wmf){width="1.1770833333333333in"
height="0.20833333333333334in"}denotes the total number of NACK bits
transmitted

● ![](media/image74.wmf){width="2.0416666666666665in"
height="0.20833333333333334in"}denotes the number of NACK bits decoded
as ACK bits at the receiver, i.e. the number of received ACK bits

● NACK bits in the definition do not contain the NACK bits which are
mapped from DTX, i.e. NACK bits received when DTX is sent should not be
considered.

ACK/NACK repetitions are disabled for PUCCH transmission. Random
codeword selection is assumed.

Note: NACK to ACK requirement only applies to the PUCCH format3 16AN
bits cases.

#### 8.3.7.1 Minimum requirement

The NACK to ACK probability shall not exceed 0,1% at the SNR given in
table 8.3.7.1-1 for 16 AN bits.

### 8.3.8 CQI performance requirements for PUCCH format 2 with DTX detection

The requirements in this clause apply to a BS supporting PUCCH format 2
with DTX. It is optional for a BS to support PUCCH format 2 with DTX.

A BS may meet the PUCCH format 2 requirements specified in Clause
8.3.8.1 instead of requirements specified in Clause 8.3.3.1.

The CQI block error probability (BLER) is defined as the sum of the:

\- conditional probability of incorrectly decoding the CQI information
when the CQI information is sent and

\- conditional probability of detecting UE transmission as DTX, when the
CQI information is sent.

The CQI false alarm probability is defined as the conditional
probability of false detecting the CQI information transmitted from UE
when no CQI information is sent.

The CQI information bit payload per sub-frame is equal to 4 bits.

Test parameters for PUCCH transmission on two antenna ports are
presented in Annex A.10.

#### 8.3.8.1 Minimum requirements

The CQI false alarm probability and the CQI block error probability
shall not exceed 10% and 1%, respectively, at the SNR given in table
8.3.8.1-1.

### 8.3.9 PUCCH performance requirements for coverage enhancement

#### 8.3.9.1 DTX to ACK performance

The DTX to ACK requirement is valid for any number of receive antennas,
for all frame structures and for any channel bandwidth.

##### 8.3.9.1.1 Minimum requirement

The DTX to ACK probability, i.e. the probability that ACK is detected
when nothing is sent per PUCCH transmission, shall not exceed 1% per
PUCCH transmission. A PUCCH transmission may take multiple subframes due
to PUCCH transmission repetition. The performance measure is defined as
follows:

![](media/image71.wmf){width="4.65625in" height="0.3958333333333333in"},

where:

\- \#(false ACK bits) denotes the number of detected ACK bits per PUCCH
transmission.

\- \#(ACK/NACK bits) denotes the number of encoded bits per PUCCH
transmission.

\- \#(PUCCH DTX) denotes the number of DTX occasions per PUCCH
transmission.

#### 8.3.9.2 ACK missed detection requirements for single user PUCCH format 1a

The ACK missed detection probability is the probability of not detecting
an ACK when an ACK is sent.

##### 8.3.9.2.1 Minimum requirements

The ACK missed detection probability shall not exceed 1% at the SNR
given in table 8.3.9.2.1-1 for 1Tx.

### 8.3.10 ACK missed detection requirements for PUCCH format 4

The ACK missed detection probability is the probability of not detecting
an ACK bit when an ACK bit was sent on the particular bit position, with
each missed ACK bit being accounted as one error.

The number of encoded ACK/NACK bits per sub-frame is defined for two
cases as presented below:

● 24AN bits with 1PRB allocated

● 64AN bits with 2PRB allocated

The requirements are applicable for FDD only, TDD only and TDD-FDD CA.

The requirements are applicable for both PUCCH on PCell and PUCCH on
SCell.

ACK/NACK repetitions are disabled for PUCCH transmission. DAI based
codebook size determination is disabled. Random codeword selection is
assumed.

#### 8.3.10.1 Minimum requirements

The ACK missed detection probability shall not exceed 1% at the SNR
given in table 8.3.10.1-1 and table 8.3.10.1‑2 for 24 AN bits with 1 PRB
allocated and 64 AN bits with 2 PRB allocated per sub-frame,
respectively.

8.4 Performance requirements for PRACH
--------------------------------------

### 8.4.1 PRACH False alarm probability

The false alarm requirement is valid for any number of receive antennas,
for all frame structures and for any channel bandwidth.

The false alarm probability is the conditional total probability of
erroneous detection of the preamble (i.e. erroneous detection from any
detector) when input is only noise.

#### 8.4.1.1 Minimum requirement

The false alarm probability shall be less than or equal to 0.1%.

### 8.4.2 PRACH detection requirements

The probability of detection is the conditional probability of correct
detection of the preamble when the signal is present. There are several
error cases -- detecting different preamble than the one that was sent,
not detecting a preamble at all or correct preamble detection but with
the wrong timing estimation. For AWGN, a timing estimation error occurs
if the estimation error of the timing of the strongest path is larger
than 1.04us. For ETU70 and EPA1, a timing estimation error occurs if the
estimation error of the timing of the strongest path is larger than
2.08us. The strongest path for the timing estimation error refers to the
strongest path (i.e. average of the delay of all paths having the same
highest gain = 310ns for ETU) in the power delay profile.

The test preambles for normal mode are listed in table A.6-1 and the
test preambles for high speed mode restriced set type A are listed in
A.6-2. The test preambles for coverage enhancement are listed in table
A.6-3. The test preambles for high speed mode restriced set type B are
listed in A.6-4.

#### 8.4.2.1 Minimum requirements

The probability of detection shall be equal to or exceed 99% for the SNR
levels listed in Tables 8.4.2.1-1 to 8.4.2.1-5.

The requirements for Burst format 4 are optional and only valid for base
stations supporting TDD. The requirements for high speed mode restricted
set type A (table 8.4.2.1-2) and high speed mode restricted set type B
(table 8.4.2.1-5) are only valid for the base stations supporting high
speed mode restricted set A and restricted set type B respectively.

The requirements for coverage enhancement (Tables 8.4.2.1-3 and
8.4.2.1-4) are only valid for the base stations supporting coverage
enhancement.

8.5 Performance requirements for Narrowband IoT
-----------------------------------------------

### 8.5.1 Requirements for NPUSCH format 1

#### 8.5.1.1 Requirements

The performance requirement of NPUSCH format 1 is determined by a
minimum required throughput for a given SNR. The required throughput is
expressed as a fraction of maximum throughput for the FRCs listed in
Annex A16. The performance requirements assume HARQ retransmissions.

An NB-IoT Base Station supports 15 kHz subcarrier spacing requirements,
or 3.75 kHz subcarrier spacing requirements, or both.

For 15kHz subcarrier spacing single-subcarrier/multi-subcarrier, the
demodulation requirements apply for the supported number of subcarriers.

Table 8.5.1.1-1: Test parameters

  Parameter                              Value
  -------------------------------------- ----------
  Maximum number of HARQ transmissions   4
  RV sequence                            RV0, RV2

##### 8.5.1.1.1 Minimum requirements

The throughput shall be equal to or larger than the fraction of maximum
throughput stated in table 8.5.1.1.1-1 for the single-subcarrier of
3.75KHz subcarrier spacing, in table 8.5.1.1.1-2 for 15KHz subcarrier
spacing at the given SNR for 1Tx, and in table 8.5.1.1.1-3 for
multi-subcarrier of 15KHz subcarrier spacing at the given SNR for 1Tx.

### 8.5.2 Performance requirements for NPUSCH format 2

#### 8.5.2.1 DTX to ACK performance

The DTX to ACK probability for NPUSCH format 2 case denotes the
probability that ACK is detected when nothing is sent on the wanted
signal and only the noise is present per NPUSCH format 2 transmission.

An NB-IoT Base Station supports 15 KHz sub-carrier spacing requirements,
or 3.75 KHz sub-carrier spacing requirements, or both.

##### 8.5.2.1.1 Minimum requirement

The DTX to ACK probability, i.e. the probability that ACK is detected
when nothing was sent, shall not exceed 1% per NPUSCH format 2
transmission. Where the performance measure definition is as follows:

where:

\- \#(false ACK bits) denotes the number of detected ACK bits.

\- \#(ACK/NACK bits) denotes the number of HARQ-ACK information bit per
NPUSCH format 2 transmission.

\- \#( NPUSCH format 2 DTX) denotes the number of DTX occasions.

#### 8.5.2.2 ACK missed detection requirements

The ACK missed detection probability is the probability of not detecting
an ACK when an ACK was sent per NPUSCH format 2 transmission.

##### 8.5.2.2.1 Minimum requirements

The ACK missed detection probability shall not exceed 1% at the SNR
given in table 8.5.2.2.1-1 and table 8.5.2.2.1-2 for 1Tx case.

### 8.5.3 Performance requirements for NPRACH

#### 8.5.3.1 NPRACH False alarm probability

The false alarm requirement is valid for any number of receive antennas,
for all repetition numbers and for any number of subcarriers.

The false alarm probability is the conditional total probability of
erroneous detection of the preamble (i.e. erroneous detection from any
detector) when input is only noise.

##### 8.5.3.1.1 Minimum requirement

The false alarm probability shall be less than or equal to 0.1%.

#### 8.5.3.2 NPRACH detection requirements

The probability of detection is the conditional probability of correct
detection of the preamble when the signal is present. There are several
error cases -- detecting different preamble than the one that was sent,
not detecting a preamble at all or correct preamble detection but with
the wrong timing estimation. A timing estimation error occurs if the
estimation error of the timing of the strongest path is larger than
3.646us. The strongest path for the timing estimation error refers to
the strongest path in the power delay profile.

The requirements for TDD are optional and only valid for base stations
supporting TDD.

  Parameter                                 Value
  ----------------------------------------- -------
  Narrowband physical layer cell identity   0
  Initial subcarrier index                  0
  Uplink-downlink configuration for TDD     1
  Special subframe configuration for TDD    7

##### 8.5.3.2.1 Minimum requirements

The probability of detection shall be equal to or exceed 99% for the SNR
levels listed in table 8.5.3.2.1-1.

expressed as a fraction of maximum throughput for the FRCs listed in
Annex A. The performance requirements assume HARQ retransmissions. The
requirements defined based on FRC in Annex A.23 apply to the BS
supporting subslot-PUSCH.

Table 8.6.1-1: Test parameters for testing subslot-PUSCH

  Parameter                              Value

  RV sequence                            0, 2, 3, 1, 0, 2, 3, 1
  Number of HARQ processes               16

#### 8.6.1.1 Minimum requirements

The throughput shall be equal to or larger than the fraction of maximum
throughput stated in the Tables 8.6.1.1-1 to 8.6.1.1-4 at the given SNR
for 1Tx.

########  Annex A (normative): Reference measurement channels

The parameters for the reference measurement channels are specified in
clause A.1 for E-UTRA reference sensitivity and in-channel selectivity
and in clause A.2 for dynamic range.

A schematic overview of the encoding process for the E-UTRA reference
measurement channels is provided in Figure A-1.

E-UTRA receiver requirements in the present document are defined with a
throughput stated relative to the Maximum throughput of the FRC. The
Maximum throughput for an FRC equals the Payload size \* the Number of
uplink subframes per second. For FDD, 1000 uplink sub-frames per second
are used.

The parameters for the reference measurement channels are specified in
clause A.12 for NB-IoT reference sensitivity and in clause A.13 for
dynamic range.

A schematic overview of the encoding process for the NB-IoT reference
measurement channels is provided in Figure A-2.

NB-IoT receiver requirements in the present document are defined with a
throughput stated relative to the Maximum throughput of the FRC. The
Maximum throughput for an FRC equals the Payload size / (Number of
Resource Unit \* time to send one Resource Unit).

########  Annex B (normative): Propagation conditions

B.1 Static propagation condition
================================

The propagation for the static performance measurement is an Additive
White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) environment. No fading or multi-paths exist
for this propagation model.

B.2 Multi-path fading propagation conditions
============================================

Tables B.2-1 -- B.2-3 show multi-path delay profiles that are used for
the performance measurements in multi-path fading environment. All taps
have classical Doppler spectrum, defined as:

A multipath fading propagation condition is defined by a combination of
a multi-path delay profile and a maximum Doppler frequency *f~D~* which
is either 5, 70 or 300 Hz. In addidion, 200 Hz Doppler frequency is
specified for UL timing adjustment performance requirement.

For carrier aggregation requirements, the fading of the signals for each
carrier shall be independent.

B.3 High speed train condition
==============================

High speed train conditions are as follows:

> Scenario 1 / Scenario 1-LTE500a / Scenario 1-LTE500b: Open space
>
> Scenario 3 / Scenario 3-LTE500a / Scenario 3-LTE500b: Tunnel for
> multi-antennas

The high speed train conditions for the test of the baseband performance
are two non-fading propagation channels in both scenarios. For BS with
Rx diversity defined in scenario 1 / Scenario 1-LTE500a / Scenario
1-LTE500b, the Doppler shift variation is the same between antennas.

Doppler shift for both scenarios is given by:

(B.3.1)

where is the Doppler shift and is the maximum Doppler frequency. The
cosine of angle is given by:

, (B.3.2)

, (B.3.3)

, (B.3.4)

where is the initial distance of the train from BS, and is BS-Railway
track distance, both in meters; is the velocity of the train in m/s, is
time in seconds.

Doppler shift and cosine angle is given by equation B.3.1 and
B.3.2-B.3.4 respectively, where the required input parameters listed in
table B.3-1 and B.3-2, and the resulting Doppler shift shown in Figure
B.3-1, B.3-2, B.3-3, B.3-4, B.3-5 and B.3-6 are applied for all
frequency bands.

B.4 Moving propagation conditions
=================================

Figure B.4-1 illustrates the moving propagation conditions for the test
of the UL timing adjustment performance. The time difference between the
reference timing and the first tap is according Equation (B.4-1). The
timing difference between moving UE and stationary UE is equal to Δτ -
(*T~A~* −31)×16*T~s~*. The relative timing among all taps is fixed. The
parameters for the moving propagation conditions are shown in
Table B.4-1.

The correlation matrices for high, medium and low correlation are
defined in Table B.5.2-2, B.5.2-3 and B.5.2-4 as below.

The values in Table B.5.2-2 have been adjusted for the 2x4 and 4x4 high
correlation cases to insure the correlation matrix is positive
semi-definite after round-off to 4 digit precision. This is done using
the equation:

Where the value \"a\" is a scaling factor such that the smallest value
is used to obtain a positive semi-definite result. For the 2x4 high
correlation case, a=0.00010. For the 4x4 high correlation case,
a=0.00012.

The same method is used to adjust the 4x4 medium correlation matrix in
Table B.5.2-3 to insure the correlation matrix is positive semi-definite
after round-off to 4 digit precision with a =0.00012.

degrees polarization slant angles are deployed at UE.

For the cross-polarized antennas, the N antennas are labelled such that
antennas for one polarization are listed from 1 to N/2 and antennas for
the other polarization are listed from N/2+1 to N, where N is the number
of TX or RX antennas.

B.6 Interference model for enhanced performance requirements type A and type B
==============================================================================

This clause provides a description for the modelling of inter-cell
interfering UE transmissions for enhanced performance requirements type
A and type B, including: definition of dominant interferer proportion,
interference model for synchronous scenario and interference model for
asynchronous scenario.

B.6.1 Dominant interferer proportion
------------------------------------

Each inter-cell interferer involved in enhanced performance requirements
type A and type B is characterized by its associated dominant interferer
proportion (DIP) value:

( = 1,..., )

where is the received energy from the *i*-th strongest inter-cell
interferer involved in the requirement scenario and where is the the
energy of the white noise source consistent with the definition provided
in clause 8.1 and is the total number of simultaneously transmitted
inter-cell interferers involved in a given requirement scenario.

B.6.2 Interference model for synchronous scenario
-------------------------------------------------

This clause provides interference modelling for each explicitly modelled
inter-cell interferer in the requirement scenario where the inter-cell
interferer(s) are time-synchronous with the tested signal.

In each subframe, each interferer shall transmit 16QAM randomly
modulated data over the entire PUSCH region and the same resource blocks
as the tested signal. Demodulation reference signal, configured
according to Table 8.2.6-1 for enhanced performance requirements type A,
and Table 8.2.9-1 to Table 8.2.9-2 for enhanced performance requirements
type B, is transmitted associated with the transmission of PUSCH.

B.6.3 Interference model for asynchronous scenario
--------------------------------------------------

This clause provides interference modelling for each explicitly modelled
inter-cell interferer in the requirement scenario where the inter-cell
interferer(s) are time-asynchronous with the tested signal.

Two interfering UEs from the same interfering cell, named interferer 1-1
and interferer 1-2, are modelled. Interferer 1-1 and interferer 1-2
shall transmit 16QAM randomly modulated data over the entire PUSCH
region and the same resource blocks as the tested signal, respectively
in the even subframes and odd subframes, as illustrated in Figure
B.6.3-1. Demodulation reference signal, configured according to Table
8.2.6A-1, is transmitted associated with the transmission of PUSCH. The
transmissions of both interferer 1-1 and interferer 1-2 are delayed with
respect to the tested signal by 0.33 ms.

60 721-3-4 \"Stationary use at non weather protected locations\" \[14\]

Normally it should be sufficient for all tests to be conducted using
normal test conditions except where otherwise stated. For guidance on
the use of test conditions to be used in order to show compliance refer

########  Annex E (normative): Error Vector Magnitude

E.1 Reference point for measurement
===================================

The EVM shall be measured at the point after the FFT and a zero-forcing
(ZF) equalizer in the receiver, as depicted in Figure E.1-1 below.

Figure E.1-1: Reference point for EVM measurement

E.2 Basic unit of measurement
=============================

For 15 kHz, 7.5 kHz,1.25 kHz, 2.5 kHz subcarrier spacing, the basic unit
of EVM measurement is defined over one subframe (1ms) for subframe TTI
and over one sTTI when supporting sTTI feature in the time domain and
subcarriers (180kHz) in the frequency domain:

For 0.37 kHz subcarrier spacing, the basic unit of EVM measurement is
defined over one slot (3ms) in the time domain and subcarriers (180kHz)
in the frequency domain:

where

is the set of symbols with the considered modulation scheme being active
within the subframe or within the sTTI,

is the set of subcarriers within the subcarriers with the considered
modulation scheme being active in symbol *t*,

*is* the ideal signal reconstructed by the measurement equipment in
accordance with relevant Tx models,

is the modified signal under test defined in E.3.

Note: Although the basic unit of measurement is one subframe or one
sTTI, the equalizer is calculated over 10 subframe measurement periods
to reduce the impact of noise in the reference symbols. The boundaries
of the 10 subframe measurement periods need not be aligned with radio
frame boundaries.

E.3 Modified signal under test
==============================

Implicit in the definition of EVM is an assumption that the receiver is
able to compensate a number of transmitter impairments. The signal under
test is equalised and decoded according to:

where

is the time domain samples of the signal under test.

is the sample timing difference between the FFT processing window in
relation to nominal timing of the ideal signal. Note that two timing
offsets are determined, the corresponding EVM is measured and the
maximum used as described in E.7.

is the RF frequency offset.

is the phase response of the TX chain.

is the amplitude response of the TX chain.

E.4 Estimation of frequency offset
==================================

The observation period for determining the frequency offset shall be 1
ms.

For 0.37 kHz, the observation period for determining the frequency
offset shall be 6 ms.For 2.5 kHz, the observation period for determining
the frequency offset shall be 1 ms.

E.5 Estimation of time offset
=============================

The observation period for determining the sample timing difference
shall be 1 ms.

For 0.37 kHz, the observation period for determining the sample timing
difference shall be 6 ms.

For 2.5 kHz, the observation period for determining the sample timing
difference shall be 1 ms.

In the following represents the middle sample of the EVM window of
length (defined in E.5.1) or the last sample of the first window half if
is even.

is estimated so that the EVM window of length is centred on the measured
cyclic prefix of the considered OFDM symbol. To minimize the estimation
error the timing shall be based on the primary synchronization signal
and reference signals. To limit time distortion of any transmit filter
the reference signals in the 1 outer RBs are not taken into account in
the timing estimation

Two values for are determined:

and

where if is odd and if is even.

When the cyclic prefix length varies from symbol to symbol (e.g. time
multiplexed MBMS and unicast) then shall be further restricted to the
subset of symbols with the considered modulation scheme being active and
with the considered cyclic prefix length type.

Table E.5.1-1 and Table E.5.1-1a below specify EVM window length (W) for
normal CP, the cyclic prefix length is 160 for symbols 0 and 144 for
symbols 1-6.

E.5.1-2d specify the EVM window length (W) for extended CP for 15 kHz,
7.5 kHz ,1.25 kHz, 2.5 kHz and 0.37 kHz sub-carrier spacing, the cyclic
prefix length is 512, 1024 ,6144, 3072 and 9208 respectively.

E.6 Estimation of TX chain amplitude and frequency response parameters
======================================================================

The equalizer coefficients and are determined as follows:

1\. Calculate the complex ratios (amplitude and phase) of the post-FFT
acquired signal and the post-FFT Ideal signal , for each reference
symbol, over 10 subframes. This process creates a set of complex ratios:

Where the post-FFT Ideal signal is constructed by the measuring
equipment according to the relevant TX specifications, using the
following parameters: restricted content: i.e. nominal Reference Symbols
and the Primary Synchronisation Channel, (all other modulation symbols
are set to 0 V), nominal carrier frequency, nominal amplitude and phase
for each applicable subcarrier, nominal timing.

2\. Perform time averaging at each reference signal subcarrier of the
complex ratios, the time-averaging length is 10 subframes. Prior to the
averaging of the phases an unwrap operation must be performed according
to the following definition: The unwrap operation corrects the radian
phase angles of by adding multiples of 2\*PI when absolute phase jumps
between consecutive time instances t~i~ are greater then or equal to the
jump tolerance of PI radians. This process creates an average amplitude
and phase for each reference signal subcarrier (i.e. every third
subcarrier with the exception of the reference subcarrier spacing across
the DC subcarrier).

Where *N* is the number of reference symbol time-domain locations *t~i~*
from Z\'(f,t) for each reference signal subcarrier .

3\. The equalizer coefficients for amplitude and phase and at the
reference signal subcarriers are obtained by computing the moving
average in the frequency domain of the time-averaged reference signal
subcarriers, i.e. every third subcarrier. The moving average window size
is 19. For reference subcarriers at or near the edge of the channel the
window size is reduced accordingly as per figure E.6-1.

4\. Perform linear interpolation from the equalizer coefficients and to
compute coefficients , for each subcarrier.

Figure E.6-1: Reference subcarrier smoothing in the frequency domain

E.7 Averaged EVM
================

EVM is averaged over all allocated downlink resource blocks with the
considered modulation scheme in the frequency domain, and a minimum of
10 downlink subframes:

For FDD the averaging in the time domain equals the 10 subframe duration
of the 10 subframes measurement period from the equalizer estimation
step.

For TDD the averaging in the time domain can be calculated from
subframes of different frames and should have a minimum of 10 subframes
averaging length. TDD special fields (DwPTS and GP) are not included in
the averaging.

*Where Ni* is the number of resource blocks with the considered
modulation scheme in subframe or sTTI *i* and *N~dl~* is the number of
allocated downlink subframes or sTTI in one frame.

The EVM requirements shall be tested against the maximum of the RMS
average at the window W extremities of the EVM measurements:

Thus is calculated using in the expressions above and is calculated
using in the calculation.

Thus we get:

The averaged EVM with the minimum averaging length of at least 10
subframes is then achieved by further averaging of the results

########  Annex F (Informative): Unwanted emission requirements for multi-carrier BS

F.1 General
===========

In clause 6.6, unwanted emission requirements for single carrier or
multi-carrier BS are specified. This multi-carrier BS corresponds to a
multi-carrier BS for E-UTRA, or a BS supporting intra-band contiguous
CA. The following two pragmatic scenarios are considered in this annex:

\- multi-carrier BS of different E-UTRA channel bandwidths, covering all
scenarios except the channel bandwidth of the outermost carrier less
than 5 MHz

\- multi-carrier BS of E-UTRA and UTRA, covering all scenarios except
the channel bandwidth of the outermost carrier less than 5 MHz.

All scenarios for channel bandwidths of the outermost carrier less than
5 MHz are for further study. The guidelines below assumes that the power
spectral density of the multiple carriers is the same. All other
combinations of multiple carriers are ffs.

Note 1: Further information and analysis for these scenarios can be
found in TR 36.942 \[9\].

F.2 Multi-carrier BS of different E-UTRA channel bandwidths
===========================================================

For a multi-carrier E-UTRA BS transmitting a group of carriers of
different channel bandwidths, the channel bandwidth of the outermost
carriers (≥5 MHz) should be considered for ACLR and Operating band
unwanted emission requirements. That is, the corresponding requirements
for the channel bandwidth of each of the outermost carriers should be
applied at the respective side of the group of transmitted carriers.

F.3 Multi-carrier BS of E-UTRA and UTRA
=======================================

For a multi-carrier BS transmitting a group of carriers of E-UTRA and
UTRA, the RAT being used on the outermost carriers (≥5 MHz) should be
considered for ACLR and Operating band unwanted emission requirements.
That is, the corresponding requirements for the RAT being used on each
of the outermost carriers should be applied at the respective side of
the group of transmitted carriers.

######## * *Annex G (Informative): Regional requirement for protection of DTT

G.1 Regional requirement for protection of DTT
==============================================

The European Communications Committee (ECC) has adopted the \"ECC
Decision on harmonised conditions for Mobile/Fixed Communications
Networks operating in the band 790-862 MHz\" \[12\] applicable for BS
operating in band 20. The decision defines a requirement for
\"Out-of-block BEM baseline requirements for \'mobile/fixed
communications network\' (MFCN) base stations within the spectrum
allocated to the broadcasting (DTT) service\", where three different
cases A, B, and C for protecting broadcasting DTT are defined. These
cases can be applied on a per-channel and/or per-region basis, i.e. for
the same channel different cases can be applied in different geographic
areas (e.g. area related to DTT coverage) and different cases can be
applied to different channels in the same geographic area.

For band 20, compliance with the regulatory requirements in Europe
referenced above can be assessed based on the manufacturer\'s
declaration of P~EM,N~ specified in clause 6.6.3.3, together with the
deployment characteristics. Maximum output Power in 10 MHz (P~10MHz~) is
also declared by the manufacturer. The parameters G~ant~ and N~ant~ are
deployment specific parameters related to the deployment of the BS,
where G~ant~ is the antenna gain and N~ant~ is the number of antennas.

For each channel (N) the EIRP level is calculated using: P~EIRP,N~ =
P~EM,N~ + G~ant~ + 10\*log(N~ant~ ). The regulatory requirement in
\[12\] limits the EIRP level to the Maximum level in Table G-1 for the
protection case(s) defined in the regulation.

G.2 Regional requirement for Public Safety LTE BS in Korea
==========================================================

Public Safety LTE (PS-LTE) service, commercial mobile service and
Broadcasting are closely allocated for Band 28 in Korea. By making more
strong blocking requirements, it provides more flexible site selection
to locate for the PS-LTE BS and also it protects the uplink performance
degradation. RRA (National Radio Research Agency) Announce 2015-30,
\"Article 17 of Technical Requirements of the Other Service Radio
Equipment for Simple radio station, Space station and Earth station
(Radio Equipment for Integrated Public Network)\".

######## Annex H (Informative): Calculation of EIRP based on manufacturer declarations and site specific conditions

H.1 Calculation of EIRP based on manufacturer declarations and site specific conditions
=======================================================================================

Some regional requirements are defined per effective isotropic radiated
power (EIRP), which is a combination of the transmitted power (or in
some cases spectral density) and the effective antenna gain which is a
site specific condition. Such requirements may be applied per antenna,
per cell, or per base station. It shall be noted that the definition of
BS or cell may differ between regulations. Where the regulator
prescribes a method for EIRP calculation, that method supersedes the
proposed assessment in this annex.

The 3GPP specifications mandate manufacturer declarations of the
(conducted) output power or power spectral density per connector for the
base station under the reference conditions stated as a way to
accommodate the referred regional requirements without putting
requirements on the local site conditions.

For the case when the base station manufacturer maximum output power or
unwanted emission declarations apply per antenna connector, the maximum
EIRP can be estimated using the following formulas:

> EIRP per antenna: P~EIRP~ = P~Tx~ + G~Ant~
>
> EIRP per cell or per BS: P~EIRPcell~ =10 \* log (∑10^PEIRPn/10^)

In case the EIRP requirement is set per polarisation, the summation
shall be made per polarisation.

\"P~EIRP~\" is the resulting effective isotropic radiated power (or
radiated power spectral density) resulting from the power (or power
spectral density) declared by the manufacturer in dBm (or
dBm/measurement BW).

\"P~Tx~\" is the conducted power or power spectral density declared by
the manufacturer in dBm (or dBm/measurement BW)

\"G~Ant~\" is the effective antenna gain, calculated as the antenna gain
(dBi) minus the loss of the site infrastructure connecting the BS
antenna connector with the antenna (dB) for the applied frequency. The
antenna nominal gain is only applicable within a certain frequency
range.

\"n\" is the index number of the co-located antennas illuminating the
same cell. P~EIRPn~ is the P~EIRP~ of the n:th antenna.

\"Cell\" is in this annex used in the sense that it is the limited
geographical area covered by the carrier transmitted from one site.
