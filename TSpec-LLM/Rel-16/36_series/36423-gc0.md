4 General
=========

4.1 Procedure specification principles
--------------------------------------

The principle for specifying the procedure logic is to specify the
functional behaviour of the terminating eNB exactly and completely. Any
rule that specifies the behaviour of the originating eNB shall be
possible to be verified with information that is visible within the
system.

The following specification principles have been applied for the
procedure text in clause 8:

\- The procedure text discriminates between:

1\) Functionality which \"shall\" be executed

The procedure text indicates that the receiving node \"shall\" perform a
certain function Y under a certain condition. If the receiving node
supports procedure X but cannot perform functionality Y requested in the
initiating message of a Class 1 EP, the receiving node shall respond
with the message used to report unsuccessful outcome for this procedure,
containing an appropriate cause value.

2\) Functionality which \"shall, if supported\" be executed

The procedure text indicates that the receiving node \"shall, if
supported,\" perform a certain function Y under a certain condition. If
the receiving node supports procedure X, but does not support
functionality Y, the receiving node shall proceed with the execution of
the EP, possibly informing the requesting node about the not supported
functionality.

\- Any required inclusion of an optional IE in a response message is
explicitly indicated in the procedure text. If the procedure text does
not explicitly indicate that an optional IE shall be included in a
response message, the optional IE shall not be included. For
requirements on including *Criticality Diagnostics* IE, see section 10.

4.2 Forwards and backwards compatibility
----------------------------------------

The forwards and backwards compatibility of the protocol is assured by a
mechanism where all current and future messages, and IEs or groups of
related IEs, include ID and criticality fields that are coded in a
standard format that will not be changed in the future. These parts can
always be decoded regardless of the standard version.

4.3 Specification notations
---------------------------

For the purposes of the present document, the following notations apply:

Procedure When referring to an elementary procedure in the specification
the Procedure Name is written with the first letters in each word in
upper case characters followed by the word \"procedure\", e.g. Handover
Preparation procedure.

Message When referring to a message in the specification the MESSAGE
NAME is written with all letters in upper case characters followed by
the word \"message\", e.g. HANDOVER REQUEST message.

IE When referring to an information element (IE) in the specification
the *Information Element Name* is written with the first letters in each
word in upper case characters and all letters in Italic font followed by
the abbreviation \"IE\", e.g. *E-RAB ID* IE.

Value of an IE When referring to the value of an information element
(IE) in the specification the \"Value\" is written as it is specified in
sub clause 9.2 enclosed by quotation marks, e.g. \"Value\".

5 X2AP services
===============

The present clause describes the services an eNB offers to its
neighbours.

5.1 X2AP procedure modules
--------------------------

The X2 interface X2AP procedures are divided into two modules as
follows:

1\. X2AP Basic Mobility Procedures;

2\. X2AP Global Procedures;

The X2AP Basic Mobility Procedures module contains procedures used to
handle the UE mobility within E-UTRAN.

The Global Procedures module contains procedures that are not related to
a specific UE. The procedures in this module are in contrast to the
above module involving two peer eNBs.

5.2 Parallel transactions
-------------------------

Unless explicitly indicated in the procedure specification, at any
instance in time one protocol peer shall have a maximum of one ongoing
X2AP procedure related to a certain UE.

6 Services expected from signalling transport
=============================================

The signalling connection shall provide in sequence delivery of X2AP
messages. X2AP shall be notified if the signalling connection breaks.

X2 signalling transport is described in TS 36.422 \[21\].

7 Functions of X2AP
===================

The X2AP protocol provides the following functions:

\- Mobility Management. This function allows the eNB to move the
responsibility of a certain UE to another eNB. Forwarding of user plane
data, Status Transfer and UE Context Release function are parts of the
mobility management.

\- Dual Connectivity. This function allows the eNB to request another
eNB to provide radio resources for a certain UE while keeping
responsibility for that UE.

\- E-UTRA-NR Dual Connectivity. This function allows the eNB to request
another en-gNB to provide radio resources for a certain UE while keeping
responsibility for that UE.

\- Load Management. This function is used by eNBs to indicate resource
status, overload and traffic load to each other.

\- Reporting of General Error Situations. This function allows reporting
of general error situations, for which function specific error messages
have not been defined.

\- Resetting the X2. This function is used to reset the X2 interface.

\- Setting up the X2. This function is used to exchange necessary data
for the eNB or en-gNB for setup the X2 interface and implicitly perform
an X2 Reset.

\- eNB Configuration Update. This function allows updating of
application level data needed for two eNBs to interoperate correctly
over the X2 interface.

\- Mobility Parameters Management. **This function allows the eNB to
coordinate adaptation of mobility parameter settings with a peer eNB.**

\- Mobility Robustness Optimisation. This function allows reporting of
information related to mobility failure events.

\- Energy Saving. This function allows decreasing energy consumption by
enabling indication of cell activation/deactivation over the X2
interface.

\- X2 Release. This function allows an eNB to be aware that the
signalling connection to a peer eNB is unavailable.

\- Message Transfer. This function allows indirect transport of X2AP
messages to a peer eNB.

\- Registration. This function allows registration of eNB in case
indirect transport of X2AP messages is supported.

\- Removing the X2. This function allows removing the signalling
connection between two eNBs or between eNB and en-gNB in a controlled
manner.

\- Inter-eNB UE Context Retrieval. This function allows retrieval of a
UE context in case of resumption or re-establishment of an RRC
connection.

\- Secondary RAT Data Usage Report. This function allows eNB to get the
uplink and downlink data volumes for the Secondary RAT on a per E-RAB
basis.

\- E-UTRA - NR Spectrum Sharing. This function allows uplink and
downlink spectrum sharing between a number of E - UTRA and a number of
NR cells with overlapping coverage.

\- EN-DC Configuration Transfer. This function supports en-gNB X2 TNL
address discovery.

\- EN-DC Load Management. This function is used by MeNB/en-gNB to
indicate resource status, overload and traffic load to each other.

\- UE Radio Capability ID Mapping.

The mapping between the above functions and X2 EPs is shown in the table
below.

8.2 Basic mobility procedures
-----------------------------

### 8.2.1 Handover Preparation

#### 8.2.1.1 General

This procedure is used to establish necessary resources in an eNB for an
incoming handover. If the procedure concerns a conditional handover,
parallel transactions are allowed. Possible parallel requests are
identified by the target cell ID when the source UE AP IDs are the same.

The procedure uses UE-associated signalling.

#### 8.2.1.2 Successful Operation

Figure 8.2.1.2-1: Handover Preparation, successful operation

The source eNB initiates the procedure by sending the HANDOVER REQUEST
message to the target eNB. When the source eNB sends the HANDOVER
REQUEST message, it shall start the timer T~RELOCprep.~

If the *Conditional Handover Information Request* IE is contained in the
HANDOVER REQUEST message, the target eNB shall consider that the request
concerns a conditional handover and shall include the *Conditional
Handover Information* *Acknowledge* IE in the HANDOVER REQUEST
ACKNOWLEDGE message.

If the *New eNB UE X2AP ID* IE is contained in the *Conditional Handover
Information Request* IE included in the HANDOVER REQUEST message, then
the target eNB shall remove the existing prepared conditional HO
identified by the *New eNB UE X2AP ID* IE and the *Target Cell ID* IE.
It is up to the implementation of the target eNB when to remove the HO
information.

The allocation of resources according to the values of the *Allocation
and Retention Priority* IE included in the *E-RAB Level QoS Parameters*
IE shall follow the principles described for the E-RAB Setup procedure
in TS 36.413 \[4\].

The source eNB may include in the *GUMMEI* IE any GUMMEI corresponding
to the source MME node.

If at least one of the requested non-GBR E-RABs is admitted to the cell
indicated by the *Target Cell ID* IE, the target eNB shall reserve
necessary resources, and send the HANDOVER REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE message
back to the source eNB. The target eNB shall include the E-RABs for
which resources have been prepared at the target cell in the *E-RABs
Admitted List* IE. The target eNB shall include the E-RABs that have not
been admitted in the *E-RABs Not Admitted List* IE with an appropriate
cause value.

At reception of the HANDOVER REQUEST message the target eNB shall:

\- prepare the configuration of the AS security relation between the UE
and the target eNB by using the information in the *UE Security
Capabilities* IE and the *AS Security Information* IE in the *UE Context
Information* IE.

For each E-RAB for which the source eNB proposes to do forwarding of
downlink data, the source eNB shall include the *DL Forwarding* IE
within the *E-RABs To be Setup Item* IE of the HANDOVER REQUEST message.
The source eNB shall include the DL Forwarding IE if it requests a DAPS
handover for that E-RAB. For each E-RAB that it has decided to admit,
the target eNB may include the *DL GTP Tunnel Endpoint* IE within the
*E-RABs Admitted Item* IE of the HANDOVER REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE message to
indicate that it accepts the proposed forwarding of downlink data for
this bearer. This GTP tunnel endpoint may be different from the
corresponding GTP tunnel endpoint, i.e. the information contained in the
*Transport Layer address* IE and *GTP TEID* IE in the *E-RAB To Be
Switched in Downlink List* IE of the PATH SWITCH REQUEST message (see TS
36.413 \[4\]) depending on implementation choice.

For each bearer in the *E-RABs Admitted List* IE, the target eNB may
include the *UL GTP Tunnel Endpoint* IE to indicate that it requests
data forwarding of uplink packets to be performed for that bearer.

Upon reception of the HANDOVER REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE message the source
eNB shall stop the timer T~RELOCprep~ and terminate the Handover
Preparation procedure. If the procedure was initiated for an immediate
handover, the source eNB shall start the timer TX2RELOCoverall. The
source eNB is then defined to have a Prepared Handover for that X2
UE-associated signalling.

If the *Trace Activation* IE is included in the HANDOVER REQUEST message
then the target eNB shall, if supported, initiate the requested trace
function as described in TS 32.422 \[6\]. In particular, the target eNB
shall, if supported:

\- if the *Trace Activation* IE does not include the *MDT Configuration*
IE, initiate the requested trace session as described in TS 32.422
\[6\];

\- if the *Trace Activation* IE includes the *MDT Activation* IE, within
the *MDT Configuration* IE, set to \"Immediate MDT and Trace\" initiate
the requested trace session and MDT session as described in TS 32.422
\[6\];

\- if the *Trace Activation* IE includes the *MDT Activation* IE, within
the *MDT Configuration* IE, set to \"Immediate MDT Only\" initiate the
requested MDT session as described in TS 32.422 \[6\] and the target eNB
shall ignore *Interfaces To Trace* IE, and *Trace Depth* IE;

\- if the *Trace Activation* IE includes the *MDT Location Information*
IE, within the *MDT Configuration* IE, store this information and take
it into account in the requested MDT session;

\- if the *Trace Activation* IE includes the *Signalling based MDT PLMN
List* IE, within the *MDT Configuration* IE, the eNB may use it to
propagate the MDT Configuration as described in TS 37.320 \[31\];

\- if the *Trace Activation* IE includes the *UE Application layer
measurement configuration* IE, initiate the requested trace session and
QoE Measurement Collection function as described in TS 36.300 \[15\].

\- if the *Trace Activation* IE includes the *Bluetooth Measurement
Configuration* IE, within the *MDT Configuration* IE, take it into
account for MDT Configuration as described in TS 37.320 \[31\].

\- if the *Trace Activation* IE includes the *WLAN Measurement
Configuration* IE, within the *MDT Configuration* IE, take it into
account for MDT Configuration as described in TS 37.320 \[31\].

\- if the *Trace Activation* IE includes the *MDT Configuration NR* IE,
store and forward the *MDT Configuration NR* IE to the SgNB, if the
target eNB has configured EN-DC for the UE.

If the *Management Based MDT Allowed* IE only or the *Management Based
MDT Allowed* IE and the *Management Based MDT PLMN List* IE is contained
in the HANDOVER REQUEST message, the target eNB shall, if supported,
store the received information in the UE context, and use this
information to allow subsequent selection of the UE for management based
MDT defined in TS 32.422 \[6\].

If the *Masked IMEISV* IE is contained in the HANDOVER REQUEST message
the target eNB shall, if supported, use it to determine the
characteristics of the UE for subsequent handling.

The source eNB shall, if supported and available in the UE context,
include the *Management Based MDT Allowed* IE and the *Management Based
MDT PLMN List* IE in the HANDOVER REQUEST message, except if the source
eNB selects a serving PLMN in the target eNB which is not included in
the Management Based MDT PLMN List. If the *Management Based MDT PLMN
List* IE is not present, the source eNB shall, if supported, include the
*Management Based MDT Allowed* IE, if this information is available in
the UE context, in the HANDOVER REQUEST message, except if the source
eNB selects a serving PLMN in the target eNB different from the serving
PLMN in the source eNB.

If the *Handover Restriction List* IE is

\- contained in the HANDOVER REQUEST message, the target eNB shall

\- store the information received in the *Handover Restriction List* IE
in the UE context;

\- use this information to determine a target for the UE during
subsequent mobility action for which the eNB provides information about
the target of the mobility action towards the UE, except when one of the
E-RABs has a particular ARP value (TS 23.401 \[12\]) in which case the
information shall not apply;

\- use this information to select a proper SCG during dual connectivity
operation.

\- not contained in the HANDOVER REQUEST message, the target eNB shall
consider that no roaming and no access restriction apply to the UE.

If the *Location Reporting Information* IE is included in the HANDOVER
REQUEST message then the target eNB should initiate the requested
location reporting functionality as defined in TS 36.413 \[4\].

integrity protection algorithms in the eNB (TS 33.401 \[18\]), the eNB
shall take it into use and ignore the keys received in the *AS Security
Information* IE.

The HANDOVER REQUEST message shall contain the *Subscriber Profile ID*
*for RAT/Frequency priority* IE, if available.

setup in the HANDOVER REQUEST message, the target eNB shall consider
that the request concerns a DAPS handover for that E-RAB, as described
in TS 36.300 \[15\]. Accordingly, the target eNB shall include the *DAPS
Response Information* IE in the HANDOVER REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE message.

If the *Maximum Number of CHO Preparations* IE is included in
*Conditional Handover Information Acknowledge* IE contained in the the
HANDOVER REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE message, then the source eNB should not
prepare more candidate target cells for a CHO for the same UE towards
the target eNB than the number indicated in the *Maximum Number of CHO
Preparations* IE.

If the *Estimated Arrival Probability* IE is contained in the
*Conditional Handover Information* *Request* IE included in the HANDOVER
REQUEST message, then the target eNB may use the information to allocate
necessary resources for the incoming CHO.

If the *EPC Handover Restriction List Container* IE is included in the
HANDOVER REQUEST message, the target eNB shall, if supported, store this
information in the UE context and shall use it as specified in TS 36.300
\[15\].

If the *NR* *V2X Services Authorized* IE is contained in the HANDOVER
REQUEST message and it contains one or more IEs set to \"authorized\",
the eNB shall, if supported, consider that the UE is authorized for the
relevant service(s).

is for an IAB node.

If the *IMS Voice EPS Fallback from 5G* IE is contained in the HANDOVER
REQUEST message, the target eNB shall, if supported, store this
information in the UE context and consider that the UE was previously
handed over from NG-RAN to E-UTRAN due to an IMS voice fallback.

If the target eNB receives a HANDOVER REQUEST message containing the
*Source DL Forwarding IP Address* IE as part of the *E-RABs To Be Setup
Item* IE, the target eNB shall, if supported, store this information and

ACL functionality is deployed.

**Interaction with SN Status Transfer procedure:**

If the *UE Context Kept Indicator* IE set to \"True\" and the *E-RABs
transferred to MeNB* IE are included in the HANDOVER REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE
message, then the source eNB shall, if supported, include the
uplink/downlink PDCP SN and HFN status received from the SgNB in the SN
Status Transfer procedure towards the target eNB, as specified in TS
37.340 \[32\].

#### 8.2.1.3 Unsuccessful Operation

Figure 8.2.1.3-1: Handover Preparation, unsuccessful operation

If the target eNB does not admit at least one non-GBR E-RAB, or a
failure occurs during the Handover Preparation, the target eNB shall
send the HANDOVER PREPARATION FAILURE message to the source eNB. The
message shall contain the *Cause* IE with an appropriate value.

If the target eNB receives a HANDOVER REQUEST message containing *RRC
Context* IE that does not include required information as specified in
TS 36.331 \[9\], the target eNB shall send the HANDOVER PREPARATION
FAILURE message to the source eNB.

If the *Conditional Handover Information Request* IE is contained in the
HANDOVER REQUEST message and the target eNB rejects the handover or a
failure occurs during the Handover Preparation, the target eNB shall
include the *Requested Target Cell ID* IE in the HANDOVER PREPARATION
FAILURE message.

**Interactions with Handover Cancel procedure:**

If there is no response from the target eNB to the HANDOVER REQUEST
message before timer T~RELOCprep~ expires in the source eNB, the source
eNB should cancel the Handover Preparation procedure towards the target
eNB by initiating the Handover Cancel procedure with the appropriate
value for the *Cause* IE. The source eNB shall ignore any HANDOVER
REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE or HANDOVER PREPARATION FAILURE message received
after the initiation of the Handover Cancel procedure and remove any
reference and release any resources related to the concerned X2
UE-associated signalling.

#### 8.2.1.4 Abnormal Conditions

If the target eNB receives a HANDOVER REQUEST message containing
multiple *E-RAB ID* IEs (in the *E-RABs To Be Setup List* IE) set to the
same value, the target eNB shall not admit the corresponding E-RABs.

If the target eNB receives a HANDOVER REQUEST message containing a
*E-RAB Level QoS Parameters* IE which contains a *QCI* IE indicating a
GBR bearer (as defined in TS 23.203 \[13\]), and which does not contain
the *GBR QoS Information* IE, the target eNB shall not admit the
corresponding E-RAB.

If the supported algorithms for encryption defined in the *Encryption
Algorithms* IE in the *UE Security Capabilities* IE in the *UE Context
Information* IE, plus the mandated support of EEA0 in all UEs (TS 33.401
\[18\]), do not match any algorithms defined in the configured list of
allowed encryption algorithms in the target eNB (TS 33.401 \[18\]), the
target eNB shall reject the procedure using the HANDOVER PREPARATION
FAILURE message.

If the supported algorithms for integrity defined in the *Integrity
Protection Algorithms* IE in the *UE Security Capabilities* IE in the
*UE Context Information* IE, plus the mandated support of the EIA0
algorithm in all UEs (TS 33.401 \[18\]), do not match any algorithms
defined in the configured list of allowed integrity protection
algorithms in the eNB (TS 33.401 \[18\]), the eNB shall reject the
procedure using the HANDOVER PREPARATION FAILURE message.

If the target eNB receives a HANDOVER REQUEST message which does not
contain the *Handover Restriction List* IE, and the PLMN to be used
cannot be determined otherwise, the target eNB shall reject the
procedure using the HANDOVER PREPARATION FAILURE message.

If the target eNB receives a HANDOVER REQUEST message containing the
*Handover Restriction List* IE, and the serving PLMN is not supported by
the target cell, the target eNB shall reject the procedure using the
HANDOVER PREPARATION FAILURE message.

If the target eNB receives a HANDOVER REQUEST message which does not
contain the *CSG Membership Status* IE, and the target cell is a hybrid
cell, the target eNB shall reject the procedure using the HANDOVER
PREPARATION FAILURE message.

If the target cell is a CSG cell and the target eNB has not received any
CSG ID of the source cell, the target eNB shall reject the procedure
using the HANDOVER PREPARATION FAILURE message.

If the target cell is a CSG cell with a different CSG from the source
cell, the target eNB shall reject the procedure using the HANDOVER
PREPARATION FAILURE message.

If the *CHO trigger* IE is set to \"CHO-replace\" in the HANDOVER
REQUEST message, but there is no CHO prepared for the included *New eNB
UE X2AP ID* IE, or the candidate cell in the *Target Cell ID* IE was not
prepared using the same UE-associated signaling connection, the target
eNB shall reject the procedure using the HANDOVER PREPARATION FAILURE
message.

### 8.2.2 SN Status Transfer

#### 8.2.2.1 General

The purpose of the SN Status Transfer procedure is to transfer the
uplink PDCP SN and HFN receiver status and the downlink PDCP SN and HFN
transmitter status either, from the source to the target eNB during an
X2 handover, between the eNBs involved in dual connectivity and/or LWA,
or between MeNB and en-gNB involved in EN-DC, for each respective E-RAB
for which PDCP SN and HFN status preservation applies.

In case that the X2 handover is a DAPS handover, the SN Status Transfer
procedure may also be used to transfer the uplink PDCP SN and HFN
receiver status, or the downlink PDCP SN and HFN transmitter status for
an E-RAB associated with RLC-UM and configured with DAPS as described in
TS 36.300 \[15\].

If the SN Status Transfer procedure is applied in the course of dual
connectivity, LWA, RRC connection re-establishment or EN-DC, in the
subsequent specification text

\- the behaviour of the eNB from which the E-RAB context is transferred,
i.e., the eNB involved in dual connectivity, LWA, RRC connection
re-establishment from which data forwarding, is specified by the
behaviour of the \"source eNB\",

\- the behaviour of the eNB to which the E-RAB context is transferred,
i.e., the eNB involved in dual connectivity, LWA, RRC connection
re-establishment to which data is forwarded, is specified by the
behaviour of the \"target eNB\".

\- in case of EN-DC, the behaviour of the node from which the E-RAB
context is transferred, i.e., either the en-gNB or the MeNB from which
data is forwarded, is specified by the behaviour of the \"source eNB\",

\- in case of EN-DC, the behaviour of the node to which the E-RAB
context is transferred, i.e., either the en-gNB or the MeNB to which
data is forwarded, is specified by the behaviour of the \"target eNB\".

The procedure uses UE-associated signalling.

#### 8.2.2.2 Successful Operation

Figure 8.2.2.2-1: SN Status Transfer, successful operation

Figure 8.2.2.2-2: MeNB initiated SN Status Transfer for EN-DC,
successful operation

Figure 8.2.2.2-3: en-gNB initiated SN Status Transfer for EN-DC,
successful operation

The source eNB initiates the procedure by stop assigning PDCP SNs to
downlink SDUs and stop delivering UL SDUs towards the EPC and sending
the SN STATUS TRANSFER message to the target eNB at the time point when
it considers the transmitter/receiver status to be frozen. The target
eNB using Full Configuration for this handover as per TS 36.300 \[15\]
or for the EN-DC operations as per TS 37.340 \[32\] shall ignore the
information received in this message. In case of EN-DC, if the target
eNB performs PDCP version change or PDCP SN length change or RLC mode
change for an E-RAB as specified in TS 37.340 \[32\], it shall ignore
the information received for that E-RAB in this message.

In case that the X2 handover is a DAPS handover, the source eNB may
continue assigning PDCP SNs to downlink SDUs and delivering uplink SDUs
toward the EPC when initiating this procedure for E-RABs not configured
with DAPS as in TS 36.300 \[15\].

The *E-RABs Subject To Status Transfer List* IE included in the SN
STATUS TRANSFER message contains the E-RAB ID(s) corresponding to the
E-RAB(s) for which PDCP SN and HFN status preservation shall be applied.
In case that the X2 handover is a DAPS handover, this IE may contain the
E-RAB ID(s) corresponding to the E-RAB(s) associated with RLC-UM.

If the source eNB includes in the SN STATUS TRANSFER message, the
information on the missing and received uplink SDUs in the *Receive
Status Of UL PDCP SDUs* **IE or *Receive Status Of UL PDCP SDUs
Extended* IE or *Receive Status Of UL PDCP SDUs for PDCP SN Length 18*
IE for each E-RAB for which the source eNB has accepted the request from
the target eNB for uplink forwarding, then the target eNB may use it in
a Status Report message sent to the UE over the radio.**

For each E-RAB for which the *DL COUNT Value* IE is received in the SN
STATUS TRANSFER message, the target eNB shall use it to mark with the
value contained in the *PDCP-SN* IE of this IE the first downlink packet
for which there is no PDCP SN yet assigned. If the *DL COUNT Value
Extended* IE or *DL COUNT Value for PDCP SN Length 18* IE is included in
the *E-RABs Subject To Status Transfer Item* IE, the target eNB shall,
if supported, use the value contained in the *PDCP-SN Extended* IE of
the *DL COUNT Value Extended* IE or *PDCP-SN Length 18 IE of the DL
COUNT Value for PDCP SN Length 18* IE instead of the value contained in
the *PDCP-SN* IE of the *DL COUNT Value* IE.

For each E-RAB for which the *UL COUNT Value* IE is received in the SN
STATUS TRANSFER message, the target eNB shall not deliver any uplink
packet which has a PDCP SN lower than the value contained in the
*PDCP-SN* IE of this IE. If the *UL COUNT Value Extended* IE or *UL
COUNT Value for PDCP SN Length 18* IE is included in the *E-RABs Subject
To Status Transfer Item* IE, the target eNB shall, if supported, use the
value contained in the *PDCP-SN Extended* IE of the *UL COUNT Value
Extended* IE or *PDCP-SN Length 18 IE of the UL COUNT Value for PDCP SN
Length 18* IE instead of the value contained in the *PDCP-SN* IE of the
*UL COUNT Value* IE.

**EN-DC**

If the en-gNB sends the message to the MeNB, then the *SgNB UE X2AP ID*
IE shall be included in the SN STATUS TRANSFER message, while the *Old
eNB UE X2AP ID* IE is ignored. The *SgNB UE X2AP ID* IE is used as the
old UE ID.

If the MeNB sends the message to the en-gNB, then the *SgNB UE X2AP ID*
IE shall be included in the SN STATUS TRANSFER message, while the *New
eNB UE X2AP ID* IE is ignored. The *SgNB UE X2AP ID* IE is used as the
new UE ID.

#### 8.2.2.3 Abnormal Conditions

If the target eNB receives this message for a UE for which no prepared
handover exists at the target eNB, the target eNB shall ignore the
message.

### 8.2.3 UE Context Release

#### 8.2.3.1 General

For handover, the UE Context Release procedure is initiated by the
target eNB to indicate to the source eNB that radio and control plane
resources for the associated UE context are allowed to be released.

For dual connectivity, UE Context Release procedure is initiated by the
MeNB to finally release the UE context at the SeNB. For dual
connectivity specific mobility scenarios specified in TS 36.300 \[15\]
only resources related to the UE-associated signalling connection
between the MeNB and the SeNB are released. For EN-DC, the UE Context
Release procedure is initiated by the MeNB to finally release the UE
context at the en-gNB. For EN-DC specific mobility scenarios specified
in TS 37.340 \[32\] where SCG radio resources in the en-gNB are kept,
only resources related to the UE-associated signalling connection
between the MeNB and the en-gNB are released.

The procedure uses UE-associated signalling.

connectivity

Figure 8.2.3.2-3: UE Context Release, successful operation for EN-DC

**Handover**

The UE Context Release procedure is initiated by the target eNB. By
sending the UE CONTEXT RELEASE message the target eNB informs the source
eNB of Handover success and triggers the release of resources.

Upon reception of the UE CONTEXT RELEASE message, the source eNB may
release radio and control plane related resources associated to the UE
context. For E-RABs for which data forwarding has been performed, the
source eNB should continue forwarding of U-plane data as long as packets
are received at the source eNB from the EPC or the source eNB buffer has
not been emptied (an implementation dependent mechanism decides that
data forwarding can be stopped). When the eNB supporting L-GW function
for SIPTO\@LN operation releases radio and control plane related
resources associated to the UE context, it shall also request using
intra-node signalling the collocated L-GW to release the SIPTO\@LN PDN
connection as defined in TS 23.401 \[12\].

**Dual Connectivity**

The UE Context Release procedure is initiated by the MeNB. By sending
the UE CONTEXT RELEASE message the MeNB informs the SeNB that the UE
Context can be removed.

Upon reception of the UE CONTEXT RELEASE message, the SeNB may release
radio and control plane related resources associated to the UE context.
For E-RABs for which data forwarding has been performed, the SeNB should
continue forwarding of U-plane data as long as packets are received at
the SeNB from the EPC or the SeNB buffer has not been emptied (an
implementation dependent mechanism decides that data forwarding can be
stopped). The SeNB supporting L-GW function for LIPA operation shall
also request using intra-node signalling the collocated L-GW to release
the LIPA PDN connection as defined in TS 23.401 \[12\]. If the *SIPTO
Bearer Deactivation Indication* IE is received in the UE CONTEXT RELEASE
message, the SeNB supporting L-GW function for SIPTO\@LN operation shall
also request using intra-node signalling the collocated L-GW to release
the SIPTO\@LN PDN connection as defined in TS 23.401 \[12\].

**EN-DC**

The UE Context Release procedure is initiated by the MeNB. By sending
the UE CONTEXT RELEASE message the MeNB informs the en-gNB that the UE
Context can be removed.

Upon reception of the UE CONTEXT RELEASE message, the en-gNB may release
radio and control plane related resources associated to the UE context.
For E-RABs for which data forwarding has been performed, the en-gNB
should continue forwarding of U-plane data as long as packets are
received at the en-gNB from the EPC or the en-gNB buffer has not been
emptied (an implementation dependent mechanism decides that data
forwarding can be stopped).

In the course of signalling for EN-DC, the *SgNB UE X2AP ID* IE shall be
included in the UE CONTEXT RELEASE message, while the *Old eNB UE X2AP
ID* IE is ignored. The *SgNB UE X2AP ID* IE is used as the new UE ID.

**Interaction with the MeNB initiated SeNB Release procedure:**

The SeNB may receive the SENB RELEASE REQUEST message including the *UE
Context Kept Indicator* IE set to \"True\", upon which the SeNB shall,
if supported, only release the resources related to the UE-associated
signalling connection between the MeNB and the SeNB, as specified in TS
36.300 \[15\].

**Interaction with the MeNB initiated SgNB Release procedure:**

The en-gNB may receive the SGNB RELEASE REQUEST message including the
*UE Context Kept Indicator* IE set to \"True\", upon which the en-gNB
shall, if supported, only release the resources related to the
UE-associated signalling connection between the MeNB and the en-gNB, as
specified in TS 37.340 \[32\].

#### 8.2.3.3 Unsuccessful Operation

Not applicable.

#### 8.2.3.4 Abnormal Conditions

If the UE Context Release procedure is not initiated towards the source
eNB from any prepared eNB before the expiry of the timer
TX2~RELOCoverall~, the source eNB shall request the MME to release the
UE context.

If the UE returns to source eNB before the reception of the UE CONTEXT
RELEASE message or the expiry of the timer TX2~RELOCoverall~, the source
eNB shall stop the TX2~RELOCoverall~ and continue to serve the UE.

### 8.2.4 Handover Cancel

#### 8.2.4.1 General

The Handover Cancel procedure is used to enable a source eNB to cancel
an ongoing handover preparation or an already prepared handover.

The procedure uses UE-associated signalling.

#### 8.2.4.2 Successful Operation

Figure 8.2.4.2-1: Handover Cancel, successful operation

The source eNB initiates the procedure by sending the HANDOVER CANCEL
message to the target eNB. The source eNB shall indicate the reason for
cancelling the handover by means of an appropriate cause value.

At the reception of the HANDOVER CANCEL message, the target eNB shall
remove any reference to, and release any resources previously reserved
to the concerned UE context.

The *New* *eNB UE X2AP ID* IE and, if available, the *New eNB UE X2AP ID
Extension* IE shall be included if it has been obtained from the target
eNB.

If the *Candidate Cells To Be Cancelled List* IE is included in the
HANDOVER CANCEL message, the target eNB shall consider that the source
eNB is cancelling only the handover associated to the candidate cells
identified by the included ECGI and associated to the UE-associated
signaling connection identified by the *Old eNB UE X2AP ID* IE (or the
*Old eNB UE X2AP ID Extension* IE if included) and, if included , also
by the *New eNB UE X2AP ID* IE (or the *New eNB UE X2AP ID Extension* IE
if included).

#### 8.2.4.3 Unsuccessful Operation

Not applicable.

#### 8.2.4.4 Abnormal Conditions

Should the HANDOVER CANCEL message refer to a context that does not
exist, the target eNB shall ignore the message.

If the *Candidate Cells To Be Cancelled List* IE is included in the
HANDOVER CANCEL message and the handover is not associated to a
conditional handover, the target eNB shall ignore the *Candidate Cells
To Be Cancelled List* IE.

If one or more candidate cells in the *Candidate Cells To Be Cancelled
List* IE included in the HANDOVER CANCEL message were not prepared using
the same UE-associated signaling connection, the target eNB shall ignore
those non-associated candidate cells.

### 8.2.5 Handover Success

#### 8.2.5.1 General

The Handover Success procedure is used during a conditional handover or
a DAPS handover to enable a target eNB to inform the source eNB that the
UE has successfully accessed the target eNB.

The procedure uses UE-associated signalling.

#### 8.2.5.2 Successful Operation

Figure 8.2.5.2-1: Handover Success, successful operation

The target eNB initiates the procedure by sending the HANDOVER SUCCESS
message to the source eNB.

If late data forwarding was configured for this UE, the source eNB shall
start data forwarding using the tunnel information related to the global
target cell ID provided in the HANDOVER SUCCESS message.

When the source eNB receives the HANDOVER SUCCESS message, it shall
consider all other CHO preparations accepted for this UE under the same
UE-associated signalling connection in the target eNB as cancelled.

**Interactions with other procedures**

If a CONDITIONAL HANDOVER CANCEL message was received for this UE prior
the reception of the HANDOVER SUCCESS message, the source eNB node shall
consider that the UE successfully executed the handover. The source eNB
may initiate Handover Cancel procedure towards the other signaling
connections or other candidate target eNBs for this UE, if any.

#### 8.2.5.3 Unsuccessful Operation

Not applicable.

#### 8.2.5.4 Abnormal Conditions

If the HANDOVER SUCCESS message refers to a context that does not exist,
the source eNB shall ignore the message.

### 8.2.6 Conditional Handover Cancel

#### 8.2.6.1 General

The Conditional Handover Cancel procedure is used to enable a target eNB
to cancel an already prepared conditional handover.

The procedure uses UE-associated signalling.

#### 8.2.6.2 Successful Operation

Figure 8.2.6.2-1: Conditional Handover Cancel, successful operation

The target eNB initiates the procedure by sending the CONDITIONAL
HANDOVER CANCEL message to the source eNB. The target eNB shall indicate
the reason for cancelling the conditional handover by means of an
appropriate cause value.

The *New* *eNB UE X2AP ID* IE and, if available, the *New eNB UE X2AP ID
Extension* IE shall be included.

At the reception of the CONDITIONAL HANDOVER CANCEL message, the source
eNB shall consider that the target eNB is about to remove any reference
to, and release any resources previously reserved for candidate cells
associated to the UE-associated signalling identified by the *Old eNB UE
X2AP ID* IE (or the *Old eNB UE X2AP ID Extension* IE if included) and
the *New eNB UE X2AP ID* IE (or the *New eNB UE X2AP ID Extension* IE if
included).

If the *Candidate Cells To Be Cancelled List* IE is also included, the
source eNB shall consider that only the resources reserved for the cells
identified by the included ECGI are about to be released.

#### 8.2.6.3 Unsuccessful Operation

Not applicable.

#### 8.2.6.4 Abnormal Conditions

Should the CONDITIONAL HANDOVER CANCEL message refer to a context that
does not exist, the source eNB shall ignore the message.

If one or more candidate cells in the *Candidate Cells To Be Cancelled
List* IE included in the CONDITIONAL HANDOVER CANCEL message were not
prepared using the same UE-associated signaling connection, the source
eNB shall ignore those non-associated candidate cells.

### 8.2.7 Early Status Transfer 

#### 8.2.7.1 General

The purpose of the Early Status Transfer procedure is to transfer the
COUNT of the first downlink SDU that the source eNB forwards to the
target eNB or the COUNT for discarding already forwarded downlink SDUs
for respective E-RAB during DAPS Handover or Conditional Handover.

For Dual Connectivity or EN-DC, the Early Status Transfer procedure is
also used, during a Conditional Handover, from the SeNB to the MeNB as
specified in TS 36.300 \[15\], or from the en-gNB to the MeNB as
specified in TS 37.340 \[32\].

The procedure uses UE-associated signalling.

#### 8.2.7.2 Successful Operation

Figure 8.2.7.2-1: Early Status Transfer during DAPS Handover or
Conditional Handover, successful operation

Figure 8.2.7.2-2: Early Status Transfer during Conditional Handover in
dual connectivity or EN-DC operation, successful operation

**From source eNB to target eNB**

The *E-RABs Subject To Early Status Transfer List* IE included in the
EARLY STATUS TRANSFER message contains the E-RAB ID(s) corresponding to
the E-RAB(s) subject to be simultaneously served by the source and the
target eNBs during DAPS Handover or the E-RAB(s) transferred during
Conditional Handover.

For each E-RAB for which the *FIRST DL COUNT Value* IE is received in
the EARLY STATUS TRANSFER message, the target eNB shall use it as the
COUNT of the first downlink SDU that the source eNB forwards to the
target eNB. If the *FIRST DL COUNT Value Extended* IE or *FIRST DL COUNT
Value for PDCP SN Length 18* IE is included in the *E-RABs Subject To
Early Status Transfer Item* IE, the target eNB shall, if supported, use
this value instead of the value contained in the *FIRST DL COUNT Value*
IE.

For each E-RAB for which the *DISCARD DL COUNT Value* IE is received in
the EARLY STATUS TRANSFER message, the target eNB does not transmit
forwarded downlink SDUs to the UE whose COUNT is less than the provided
and discards them if transmission has not been attempted. If the
*DISCARD DL COUNT Value Extended* IE or *DISCARD DL COUNT Value for PDCP
SN Length 18* IE is included in the *E-RABs Subject To Early Status
Transfer Item* IE, the target eNB shall, if supported, use this value
instead of the value contained in the *DISCARD DL COUNT Value* IE.

**From SeNB (respectively, en-gNB) to MeNB, the source eNB for
Conditional Handover**

The *E-RABs Subject To Early Status Transfer List* IE included in the
EARLY STATUS TRANSFER message contains the E-RAB ID(s) corresponding to
the E-RAB(s) transferred during Conditional Handover.

For each E-RAB in the *E-RABs Subject To Early Status Transfer List* IE,
the source eNB shall forward to the target, the value of the received
*FIRST DL COUNT Value* IE or *DISCARD DL COUNT Value* IE. If the *FIRST
DL COUNT Value Extended* IE or *FIRST DL COUNT Value for PDCP SN Length
18* IE is included, if supported, this value is forwarded instead of the
value contained in the *FIRST DL COUNT Value* IE. If the *DISCARD DL
COUNT Value Extended* IE or *DISCARD DL COUNT Value for PDCP SN Length
18* IE is included, if supported, this value is forwarded instead of the
value contained in the *DISCARD DL COUNT Value* IE.

If the en-gNB sends the message to the MeNB, then the *SgNB UE X2AP ID*
IE shall be included in the EARLY STATUS TRANSFER message, while the
*Old eNB UE X2AP ID* IE is ignored. The *SgNB UE X2AP ID* IE is used as
the old UE ID.

#### 8.2.7.3 Abnormal Conditions

If the target eNB receives this message for a UE for which no prepared
DAPS Handover or Conditional Handover exists at the target eNB, the
target eNB shall ignore the message.

8.3 Global Procedures
---------------------

### 8.3.1 Load Indication

#### 8.3.1.1 General

The purpose of the Load Indication procedure is to transfer load and
interference co-ordination information between eNBs controlling
intra-frequency neighboring cells, and additionally between eNBs
controlling inter-frequency neighboring cells for TDD.

The procedure uses non UE-associated signalling.

#### 8.3.1.2 Successful Operation

Figure 8.3.1.2-1: Load Indication, successful operation

An eNB~1~ initiates the procedure by sending LOAD INFORMATION message to
a peer eNB~2~.

If the *UL Interference Overload Indication* IE is received in the LOAD
INFORMATION message, it indicates the interference level experienced by
the indicated cell on all resource blocks, per PRB. If the *Extended UL
Interference Overload Info* IE is received in the LOAD INFORMATION
message, the *UL Interference Overload Indication* IE indicates the
interference level experienced by the indicated cell ignoring the UL
subframe(s) represented as value \"1\" in the *Associated Subframes* IE.
The receiving eNB may take such information into account when setting
its scheduling policy and shall consider the received *UL Interference
Overload Indication* IE value valid until reception of a new LOAD
INFORMATION message carrying an update of the same IE.

If the *UL High Interference Indication* IE is received in the LOAD
INFORMATION message, it indicates, per PRB, the occurrence of high
interference sensitivity, as seen from the sending eNB. The receiving
eNB should try to avoid scheduling cell edge UEs in its cells for the
concerned PRBs. The *Target Cell ID* IE received within the *UL High
Interference Information* IE group in the LOAD INFORMATION message
indicates the cell for which the corresponding UL High Interference
Indication is meant. The receiving eNB shall consider the value of the
*UL High Interference Information* IE group valid until reception of a
new LOAD INFORMATION message carrying an update.

If the *Relative Narrowband Tx Power (RNTP)* IE is received in the LOAD
INFORMATION message, it indicates, per PRB or per subframe per PRB
(Enhanced RNTP), whether downlink transmission power is lower than the
value indicated by the *RNTP* *Threshold* IE. If the *Enhanced RNTP* IE
is included in the *Relative Narrowband Tx Power (RNTP)* IE, it
additionally indicates whether the downlink transmission power is lower
than the value specified by the *RNTP High Power Threshold* IE. The
receiving eNB may take such information into account when setting its
scheduling policy and shall consider the received *Relative Narrowband
Tx Power (RNTP)* IE value valid until reception of a new LOAD
INFORMATION message carrying an update. If the *Enhanced RNTP* IE
included in the *Relative Narrowband Tx Power (RNTP)* IE is present, the
receiving eNB shall consider the received *Enhanced RNTP* IE value valid
starting from the subframe indicated by the *Start SFN* IE and *Start
Subframe Number* IE, if present.

If the *ABS Information* IE is included in the LOAD INFORMATION message,
the *ABS Pattern Info* IE indicates the subframes designated as almost
blank subframes by the sending eNB for the purpose of interference
coordination. The receiving eNB may take such information into
consideration when scheduling UEs.

The receiving eNB may use the *Measurement Subset* IE received in the
LOAD INFORMATION message, for the configuration of specific measurements
towards the UE.

The receiving eNB shall consider the received information as immediately
applicable. The receiving eNB shall consider the value of the *ABS
Information* IE valid until reception of a new LOAD INFORMATION message
carrying an update.

If an ABS indicated in the *ABS pattern info* IE coincides with a MBSFN
subframe, the receiving eNB shall consider that the subframe is
designated as almost blank subframe by the sending eNB.

If the *Invoke Indication* IE is included in the LOAD INFORMATION
message, it indicates which type of information the sending eNB would
like the receiving eNB to send back. The receiving eNB may take such
request into account.

If the *Invoke Indication* IE is set to \"ABS Information\", it
indicates the sending eNB would like the receiving eNB to initiate the
Load Indication procedure, with the LOAD INFORMATION message containing
the *ABS Information* IE indicating non-zero ABS patterns in the
relevant cells. If the *Invoke Indication* IE is set to \"Start NAICS
Information\", it indicates the sending eNB would like the receiving eNB
to initiate the Load Indication procedure with the LOAD INFORMATION
message containing the *Dynamic DL transmission information* IE. The
first time the *Dynamic DL transmission information* IE is signalled
after receiving the *Invoke Indication* IE set to \"Start NAICS
Information\", all the NAICS parameters in the *NAICS Information* IE
shall be included. If the *Invoke Indication* IE is set to \"Stop NAICS
Information\", it indicates the sending eNB does not need NAICS
information and therefore the receiving eNB should stop signalling NAICS
parameters for the concerned cell.

If the *NAICS Information* IE is set to \"NAICS Active\", the receiving
eNB may use it for the configuration of DL interference mitigation
assistance information towards the UE. Information included in the
*NAICS Information* IE shall replace corresponding NAICS information
existing at the receiver. If the *NAICS Information* IE is set to
\"NAICS Inactive\", the receiving eNB shall consider the existing NAICS
information as invalid.

If the *Intended UL-DL Configuration* IE is included in the LOAD
INFORMATION message, it indicates the UL-DL configuration intended to be
used by the indicated cell. The receiving eNB may take such information
into account when setting its scheduling policy and shall consider the
received *Intended UL-DL Configuration* IE value valid until reception
of a new LOAD INFORMATION message carrying an update of the same IE.

If the *Extended UL Interference Overload Info* IE is received in the
LOAD INFORMATION message, the *Extended UL Interference Overload
Indication* IE indicates the interference level experienced by the
indicated cell on all resource blocks, per PRB, in the UL subframe(s)
which is represented as value \"1\" in the *Associated Subframes* IE.
The receiving eNB may take such information into account when setting
its scheduling policy and shall consider the received *Extended UL
Interference Overload Info* IE value valid until reception of a new LOAD
INFORMATION message carrying an update of the same IE.

If the *CoMP Information* IE is received in the LOAD INFORMATION
message, the receiving eNB may take the IE into account for RRM. The
receiving eNB shall consider the *CoMP Information* IE valid starting in
the subframe indicated by the *Start SFN* IE and *Start Subframe Number*
IE, if present. If the *Start SFN* IE and *Start Subframe Number* IE are
not present, then the receiving eNB shall consider the *CoMP
Information* IE as immediately valid. The receiving eNB shall consider
the *CoMP Information* IE valid until an update of the same IE, received
in a new LOAD INFORMATION message, is considered valid.

#### 8.3.1.3 Unsuccessful Operation

Not applicable.

#### 8.3.1.4 Abnormal Conditions

Void.

### 8.3.2 Error Indication

#### 8.3.2.1 General

The Error Indication procedure is initiated by an eNB to report detected
errors in one incoming message, provided they cannot be reported by an
appropriate failure message.

If the error situation arises due to reception of a message utilising UE
associated signalling, then the Error Indication procedure uses
UE-associated signalling. Otherwise the procedure uses non UE-associated
signalling.

#### 8.3.2.2 Successful Operation

Figure 8.3.2.2-1: Error Indication, successful operation.

Figure 8.3.2.2-2: eNB initiated Error Indication for EN-DC, successful
operation.

Figure 8.3.2.2-3: en-gNB initiated Error Indication for EN-DC,
successful operation.

When the conditions defined in clause 10 are fulfilled, the Error
Indication procedure is initiated by an ERROR INDICATION message sent
from the node detecting the error situation.

The ERROR INDICATION message shall contain at least either the *Cause*
IE or the *Criticality Diagnostics* IE.

In case the Error Indication procedure is triggered by UE associated
signalling, in the course of handover signalling and signalling for dual
connectivity, the *Old eNB UE X2AP ID* IE and the *New eNB UE X2AP ID*
IE shall be included in the ERROR INDICATION message. In case the Error
Indication procedure is triggered by UE associated signalling, in the
course of signalling for EN-DC, the *Old en-gNB UE X2AP ID* IE and the
*New eNB UE X2AP ID* IE shall be included in the ERROR INDICATION
message. If any of *Old eNB UE X2AP ID* IE, *Old en-gNB UE X2AP ID* IE
and *New eNB UE X2AP ID* IE is not correct, the cause shall be set to
appropriate value e.g. \"unknown Old eNB UE X2AP ID\", \"unknown Old
en-gNB UE X2AP ID\", \"unknown New eNB UE X2AP ID\" or \"unknown pair of
UE X2AP ID\".

If the UE-associated signalling connection is identified by extended eNB
UE X2AP IDs the specification text above is applicable for the UE X2AP
ID Extension accordingly.

In case of network sharing with multiple cell ID broadcast with shared
X2-C signalling transport, as specified in TS 36.300 \[15\], if the
Error Indication procedure is triggered by non UE-associated signalling,
the ERROR INDICATION message shall include the *Interface Instance
Indication* IE to identify the corresponding interface instance.

#### 8.3.2.3 Unsuccessful Operation

Not applicable.

#### 8.3.2.4 Abnormal Conditions

Not applicable.

### 8.3.3 X2 Setup

#### 8.3.3.1 General

The purpose of the X2 Setup procedure is to exchange application level
configuration data needed for two eNBs to interoperate correctly over
the X2 interface. This procedure erases any existing application level
configuration data in the two nodes and replaces it by the one received.
This procedure also resets the X2 interface like a Reset procedure would
do.

NOTE: Exchange of application level configuration data also applies
between two eNBs in case the SN (i.e. the en-gNB) does not broadcast
system information other than for radio frame timing and SFN, as
specified in the TS 37.340 \[32\]. How to use this information when this
option is used is not explicitly specified.

The procedure uses non UE-associated signalling.

#### 8.3.3.2 Successful Operation

Figure 8.3.3.2-1: X2 Setup, successful operation

An eNB~1~ initiates the procedure by sending the X2 SETUP REQUEST
message to a candidate eNB~2~. The candidate eNB~2~ replies with the X2
SETUP RESPONSE message. The initiating eNB~1~ shall transfer the
complete list of its served cells and, if available, a list of supported
GU Group Ids to the candidate eNB~2~. The candidate eNB~2~ shall reply
with the complete list of its served cells and shall include, if
available, a list of supported GU Group Ids in the reply.

activated before initiating or responding to the X2 Setup procedure and
shall still be included in the list of served cells.

The initiating eNB~1~ may include the *Neighbour Information* IE in the
X2 SETUP REQUEST message. The candidate eNB~2~ may also include the
*Neighbour Information* IE in the X2 SETUP RESPONSE message. The
*Neighbour Information* IE shall only include E-UTRAN cells that are
direct neighbours of cells in the reporting eNB. A direct neighbour of
one cell of a given eNB may be any cell belonging to an eNB that is a
neighbour of that given eNB cell e.g. even if the cell has not been
reported by a UE. The initiating eNB~1~ may include the *TAC* IE with
the *Neighbour Information* IE in the X2 SETUP REQUEST message. The
candidate eNB~2~ may also include the *TAC* IE with the *Neighbour
Information* IE in the X2 SETUP RESPONSE message. The eNB receiving the
IE may use it according to TS 36.300 \[15\].

The initiating eNB~1~ may include the *NR Neighbour Information* IE in
the X2 SETUP REQUEST message. The candidate eNB~2~ may also include the
*NR Neighbour Information* IE in the X2 SETUP RESPONSE message. The *NR
Neighbour Information* IE shall only include NR cells capable of
performing EN-DC with the corresponding served E-UTRA cell. The eNB
receiving the *NR Neighbour Information* IE may use it according to TS
36.300 \[15\].

The initiating eNB~1~ may include the *Number of Antenna Ports* IE in
the X2 SETUP REQUEST message. The candidate eNB~2~ may also include the
*Number of Antenna Ports* IE in the X2 SETUP RESPONSE message. The eNB
receiving the IE may use it according to TS 36.331 \[9\].

The initiating eNB~1~ may include the *PRACH Configuration* IE in the X2
SETUP REQUEST message. The candidate eNB~2~ may also include the *PRACH
Configuration* IE in the X2 SETUP RESPONSE message. The eNB receiving
the IE may use this information for RACH optimisation.

The initiating eNB~1~ may include the *MBSFN Subframe Info* IE in the X2
SETUP REQUEST message. The candidate eNB~2~ may also include the *MBSFN
Subframe Info* IE in the X2 SETUP RESPONSE message. The eNB receiving
the IE may use it according to TS 36.331 \[9\].

For each CSG cell or hybrid cell served by the initiating eNB~1~ the X2
SETUP REQUEST message shall contain the *CSG ID* IE. For each CSG cell
or hybrid cell served by the candidate eNB~2~ the X2 SETUP RESPONSE
message shall contain the *CSG ID* IE. The eNB receiving the IE shall
take this information into account when further deciding whether X2
handover between the source cell and the target cell may be performed.

The initiating eNB~1~ may include the *MBMS Service Area Identity List*
IE in the X2 SETUP REQUEST message. The candidate eNB~2~ may also
include the *MBMS Service Area Identity List* IE in the X2 SETUP
RESPONSE message. The eNB receiving the IE may use it according to TS
36.300 \[15\].

For each cell served by the initiating eNB~1~ the X2 SETUP REQUEST
message may contain the *MultibandInfoList* IE and may also contain the
*FreqBandIndicatorPriority* IE. For each cell served by the candidate
eNB~2~ the X2 SETUP RESPONSE message may contain the *MultibandInfoList*
IE and may also contain the *FreqBandIndicatorPriority* IE. The eNB
receiving the *MultibandInfoList* IE shall, if supported, take this
information into account when further deciding whether subsequent
mobility actions between the source cell and the target cell may be
performed, and use this IE and the *FreqBandIndicatorPriority* IE, if
received, as specified in TS 36.331 \[9\].

The initiating eNB~1~ may include the *LHN ID* IE in the X2 SETUP
REQUEST message. The candidate eNB~2~ may also include *LHN ID* IE in
the X2 SETUP RESPONSE message. The eNB receiving the IE may use it
according to TS 36.300 \[15\].

The initiating eNB~1~ may include the *BandwidthReducedSI* IE in the X2
SETUP REQUEST message. The candidate eNB~2~ may also include
*BandwidthReducedSI* IE in the X2 SETUP RESPONSE message. The eNB
receiving the IE may use it to determine a suitable target in case of
subsequent outgoing mobility involving BL UEs or UEs requiring CE.

The initiating eNB~1~ may include the *NPRACH Configuration* IE in the
X2 SETUP REQUEST message. The candidate eNB~2~ may also include the
*NPRACH Configuration* IE in the X2 SETUP RESPONSE message. The eNB
receiving the IE may use this information for RACH optimization.

**Interaction with the EN-DC Configuration Update procedure:**

The receiving eNB may forward the *Intended TDD DL-UL Configuration NR*
IE received in the *NR Neighbour Information* IE in the X2 SETUP REQUEST
message or in the X2 SETUP RESPONSE message to neighbouring en-gNBs by
triggering the EN-DC Configuration Update procedure.

**Interaction with the eNB Configuration Update procedure:**

The receiving eNB may forward the *Intended TDD DL-UL Configuration NR*
IE received in the *NR Neighbour Information* IE in the X2 SETUP REQUEST
message or in the X2 SETUP RESPONSE message to neighbouring eNBs by
triggering the eNB Configuration Update procedure.

#### 8.3.3.3 Unsuccessful Operation

Figure 8.3.3.3-1: X2 Setup, unsuccessful operation

If the candidate eNB~2~ cannot accept the setup it shall respond with an
X2 SETUP FAILURE message with appropriate cause value.

If the X2 SETUP FAILURE message includes the *Time To Wait* IE the
initiating eNB~1~ shall wait at least for the indicated time before
reinitiating the X2 Setup procedure towards the same eNB~2~.

#### 8.3.3.4 Abnormal Conditions

If the first message received for a specific TNL association is not an
X2 SETUP REQUEST, X2 SETUP RESPONSE, or X2 SETUP FAILURE message then
this shall be treated as a logical error.

If the initiating eNB~1~ does not receive either X2 SETUP RESPONSE
message or X2 SETUP FAILURE message, the eNB~1~ may reinitiate the X2
Setup procedure towards the same eNB, provided that the content of the
new X2 SETUP REQUEST message is identical to the content of the
previously unacknowledged X2 SETUP REQUEST message.

If the initiating eNB~1~ receives an X2 SETUP REQUEST message from the
peer entity on the same X2 interface:

\- In case the eNB~1~ answers with an X2 SETUP RESPONSE message and
receives a subsequent X2 SETUP FAILURE message, the eNB~1~ shall
consider the X2 interface as non operational and the procedure as
unsuccessfully terminated according to sub clause 8.3.3.3.

\- In case the eNB~1~ answers with an X2 SETUP FAILURE message and
receives a subsequent X2 SETUP RESPONSE message, the eNB~1~ shall ignore
the X2 SETUP RESPONSE message and consider the X2 interface as non
operational.

### 8.3.4 Reset

#### 8.3.4.1 General

The purpose of the Reset procedure is to align the resources in eNB~1~
and eNB~2~, or the resources in eNB and en-gNB involved in the EN-DC in
the event of an abnormal failure. The procedure resets the X2 interface.
This procedure doesn't affect the application level configuration data
exchanged during, e.g., the X2 Setup procedure, EN-DC X2 Setup
procedure.

The procedure uses non UE-associated signalling.

#### 8.3.4.2 Successful Operation

Figure 8.3.4.2-1: Reset, successful operation

The procedure is initiated with a RESET REQUEST message sent from the
eNB~1~ to the eNB~2~. Upon receipt of this message, eNB~2~ shall abort
any other ongoing procedures over X2 between eNB~1~ and eNB~2.~ The
eNB~2~ shall delete all the context information related to the eNB~1~,
except the application level configuration data exchanged during the X2
Setup or eNB Configuration Update procedures, and release the
corresponding resources. After completion of release of the resources,
the eNB~2~ shall respond with a RESET RESPONSE message.

![](media/image23.emf)

Figure 8.3.4.2-2: Reset, successful operation for EN-DC.

The procedure is initiated with a RESET REQUEST message sent from the
eNB~1~/en-gNB~1~ to en-gNB~2~/eNB~2~. Upon receipt of this message,
eNB~2~/en-gNB~2~ shall abort any other ongoing procedures over X2
between both nodes. eNB~2~/en-gNB~2~ shall delete all the context
information related to eNB~1~/en-gNB~1~, except the application level
configuration data exchanged during the EN-DC X2 Setup or EN-DC
Configuration Update procedures, and release the corresponding
resources. After completion of release of the resources,
eNB~2~/en-gNB~2~ shall respond with a RESET RESPONSE message.

If case of network sharing with multiple cell ID broadcast with shared
X2-C signalling transport, as specified in TS 36.300 \[15\], the RESET
REQUEST and the RESET RESPONSE messages shall include the *Interface
Instance Indication* IE to identify the corresponding interface
instance.

#### 8.3.4.3 Unsuccessful Operation

Void.

#### 8.3.4.4 Abnormal Conditions

If the RESET REQUEST message is received, any other ongoing procedure
(except another Reset procedure) on the same X2 interface shall be
aborted.

If Reset procedure is ongoing and the responding node receives the RESET
REQUEST message from the peer entity on the same X2 interface, it shall
respond with the RESET RESPONSE message as described in 8.3.4.2.

If the initiating node does not receive RESET RESPONSE message, the
initiating node may reinitiate the Reset procedure towards the same
eNB/en-gNB, provided that the content of the new RESET REQUEST message
is identical to the content of the previously unacknowledged RESET
REQUEST message.

### 8.3.5 eNB Configuration Update

#### 8.3.5.1 General

The purpose of the eNB Configuration Update procedure is to update
application level configuration data needed for two eNBs to interoperate
correctly over the X2 interface.

NOTE: Update of application level configuration data also applies
between two eNBs in case the SN (i.e. the en-gNB) does not broadcast
system information other than for radio frame timing and SFN, as
specified in the TS 37.340 \[32\]. How to use this information when this
option is used is not explicitly specified.

The procedure uses non UE-associated signalling.

#### 8.3.5.2 Successful Operation

Figure 8.3.5.2-1: eNB Configuration Update, successful operation

An eNB~1~ initiates the procedure by sending an ENB CONFIGURATION UPDATE
message to a peer eNB~2~ . Such message shall include an appropriate set
of up-to-date configuration data, including, but not limited to, the
complete lists of added, modified and deleted served cells, that eNB~1~
has just taken into operational use.

Upon reception of an ENB CONFIGURATION UPDATE message, eNB~2~ shall
update the information for eNB~1~ as follows:

**Update of Served Cell Information:**

\- If *Served Cells To Add* IE is contained in the ENB CONFIGURATION
UPDATE message, eNB~2~ shall add cell information according to the
information in the *Served Cell Information* IE.

\- If *Number of Antenna Ports* IE is contained in the *Served Cell
Information* IE in the ENB CONFIGURATION UPDATE message, eNB~2~ may use
this information according to TS 36.331 \[9\].

\- If the *PRACH Configuration* IE is contained in the *Served Cell
Information* IE in the ENB CONFIGURATION UPDATE message, the eNB
receiving the IE may use this information for RACH optimisation.

\- If *Served Cells To Modify* IE is contained in the ENB CONFIGURATION
UPDATE message, eNB~2~ shall modify information of cell indicated by
*Old ECGI* IE according to the information in the *Served Cell
Information* IE.

\- If *MBSFN Subframe Info* IE is contained in the *Served Cell
Information* IE in the ENB CONFIGURATION UPDATE message, eNB~2~ may use
this information according to TS 36.331 \[9\]. If a MBSFN subframe
indicated in the *MBSFN Subframe Info* IE coincides with an ABS, the
eNB~2~ shall consider that the subframe is designated as ABS by the
sending eNB.

\- If *BandwidthReducedSI* IE is contained in the *Served Cell
Information* IE in the ENB CONFIGURATION UPDATE message, eNB~2~ may use
this information to determine a suitable target in case of subsequent
outgoing mobility involving BL UEs or UEs requiring CE.

When either served cell information or neighbour information of an
existing served cell in eNB~1~ need to be updated, the whole list of
neighbouring cells, if any, shall be contained in the *Neighbour
Information* IE.

If the *Deactivation Indication* IE is contained in *Served Cells To
Modify* IE, it indicates that the concerned cell was switched off to
lower energy consumption.

The eNB~2~ shall overwrite the served cell information and the whole
list of neighbour cell information for the affected served cell.

\- If *Served Cells To Delete* IE is contained in the ENB CONFIGURATION
UPDATE message, eNB~2~ shall delete information of cell indicated by
*Old ECGI* IE.

\- If *MBMS Service Area Identity List* IE is contained in the *Served
Cell Information* IE in the ENB CONFIGURATION UPDATE message, the eNB
receiving the IE may use it according to TS 36.300 \[15\].

When the MBMS Service Area Identities of a cell in eNB~1~ need to be
updated, the whole list of MBMS Service Area Identities of the affected
cell shall be contained in the *Served Cell Information* IE.

\- If the *NPRACH Configuration* IE is contained in the *Served Cell
Information* IE in the ENB CONFIGURATION UPDATE message, the eNB
receiving the IE may use this information for RACH optimization.

**Update of GU Group Id List:**

\- If *GU Group Id To Add List* IE is contained in the ENB CONFIGURATION
UPDATE message, eNB~2~ shall add the GU Group Id to its GU Group Id
List.

\- If *GU Group Id To Delete List* IE is contained in the ENB
CONFIGURATION UPDATE message, eNB~2~ shall remove the GU Group Id from
its GU Group Id List.

If *Neighbour Information* IE is contained in the ENB CONFIGURATION
UPDATE message, eNB~2~ may use this information to update its neighbour
cell relations, or use it for other functions, like PCI selection. The
*Neighbour Information* IE shall only include E-UTRAN cells that are
direct neighbours of cells in the reporting eNB. A direct neighbour of
one cell of a given eNB may be any cell belonging to an eNB that is a
neighbour of that given eNB cell e.g. even if that cell has not been
reported by a UE. The *Neighbour Information* IE may contain the *TAC*
IE of the included cells. The receiving eNB may use *TAC* IE, as
described in TS 36.300 \[15\].

If the *NR Neighbour Information* IE is contained in the ENB
CONFIGURATION UPDATE message, eNB~2~ may use this information to update
its neighbour cell relations or use it for other functions. The *NR
Neighbour Information* IE shall only include NR cells capable of
performing EN-DC with the corresponding served E-UTRA cell. The eNB
receiving the *NR Neighbour Information* IE may use it according to TS
36.300 \[15\].

After successful update of requested information, eNB~2~ shall reply
with the ENB CONFIGURATION UPDATE ACKNOWLEDGE message to inform the
initiating eNB~1~ that the requested update of application data was
performed successfully. In case the peer eNB~2~ receives an ENB
CONFIGURATION UPDATE without any IE except for *Message Typ*e IE it
shall reply with ENB CONFIGURATION UPDATE ACKNOWLEDGE message without
performing any updates to the existing configuration.

The eNB~1~ may initiate a further eNB Configuration Update procedure
only after a previous eNB Configuration Update procedure has been
completed.

For each cell served by the initiating eNB~1~ the ENB CONFIGURATION
UPDATE message may contain the *MultibandInfoList* IE and may also
contain the *FreqBandIndicatorPriority* IE. The eNB receiving the
*MultibandInfoList* IE shall, if supported, take this information into
account when further deciding whether subsequent mobility actions
between the source cell and the target cell may be performed, and use
this IE and the *FreqBandIndicatorPriority* IE, if received, as
specified in TS 36.331 \[9\].

If the *Coverage Modification List* IE is present, eNB~2~ may use the
information in the *Cell Coverage State* IE to identify the cell
deployment configuration enabled by eNB~1~ and for configuring the
mobility towards the cell(s) indicated by the *ECGI* IE, as described in
TS 36.300 \[15\]. If the *Cell Deployment Status Indicator* IE is
present in the *Coverage Modification List* IE, the eNB~2~ shall
consider the cell deployment configuration of the cell to be modified as
the next planned configuration and shall remove any planned
configuration stored for this cell. If the *Cell Deployment Status
Indicator* IE is present and the *Cell Replacing Info* IE contains
non-empty cell list, the eNB~2~ may use this list to avoid connection or
re-establishment failures during the reconfiguration, e.g. consider the
cells in the list as possible alternative handover targets. If the *Cell
Deployment Status Indicator* IE is not present, the eNB~2~ shall
consider the cell deployment configuration of cell to be modified as
activated and replace any previous configuration for the cells indicated
in the *Coverage Modification List* IE.

**Interaction with the eNB Configuration Update procedure:**

If an eNB~2~ which has not stored a *FreqBandIndicatorPriority* IE
received from eNB~1~, but has signaled a *FreqBandIndicatorPriority* IE
to eNB~1~ after the TNL association has become available, receives an
ENB CONFIGURATION UPDATE message from eNB~1~ containing the
*FreqBandIndicatorPriority* IE, the eNB~2~ shall initiate the eNB
Configuration Update procedure towards eNB~1~ including the
*FreqBandIndicatorPriority* IE.

The receiving eNB may forward the *Intended TDD DL-UL Configuration NR*
IE received in the *NR Neighbour Information* IE in the ENB
CONFIGURATION UPDATE message to neighbouring eNBs by triggering the eNB
Configuration Update procedure.

**Interaction with the EN-DC Configuration Update procedure:**

The receiving eNB may forward the *Intended TDD DL-UL Configuration NR*
IE received in the *NR Neighbour Information* IE in the ENB
CONFIGURATION UPDATE message to neighbouring en-gNBs by triggering the
EN-DC Configuration Update procedure.

#### 8.3.5.3 Unsuccessful Operation

Figure 8.3.5.3-1: eNB Configuration Update, unsuccessful operation

If the eNB~2~ can not accept the update it shall respond with an ENB
CONFIGURATION UPDATE FAILURE message and appropriate cause value.

If the ENB CONFIGURATION UPDATE FAILURE message includes the *Time To
Wait* IE the eNB~1~ shall wait at least for the indicated time before
reinitiating the eNB Configuration Update procedure towards the same
eNB~2~. Both nodes shall continue to operate the X2 with their existing
configuration data.

#### 8.3.5.4 Abnormal Conditions

If the eNB~1~ after initiating eNB Configuration Update procedure
receives neither ENB CONFIGURATION UPDATE ACKNOWLEDGE message nor ENB
CONFIGURATION UPDATE FAILURE message, the eNB~1~ may reinitiate the eNB
Configuration Update procedure towards the same eNB~2~, provided that
the content of the new ENB CONFIGURATION UPDATE message is identical to
the content of the previously unacknowledged ENB CONFIGURATION UPDATE
message.

### 8.3.6 Resource Status Reporting Initiation

#### 8.3.6.1 General

This procedure is used by an eNB to request the reporting of load
measurements to another eNB.

The procedure uses non UE-associated signalling.

#### 8.3.6.2 Successful Operation

Figure 8.3.6.2-1: Resource Status Reporting Initiation, successful
operation

The procedure is initiated with a RESOURCE STATUS REQUEST message sent
from eNB~1~ to eNB~2~. Upon receipt, eNB~2~:

\- shall initiate the requested measurement according to the parameters
given in the request in case the *Registration Request* IE set to
\"start\"; or

\- shall stop all cells measurements and terminate the reporting in case
the *Registration Request* IE is set to \"stop\"; or

\- if supported, stop cell measurements and terminate the reporting for
cells indicated in the *Cell To Report* IE list, in case the
*Registration Request* IE is set to \"partial stop\"; or

\- if supported, add cells indicated in the *Cell To Report* IE list to
the measurements initiated before for the given measurement IDs, in case
the *Registration Request* IE is set to \"add\".

If the eNB~2~ received a RESOURCE STATUS REQUEST message, which includes
the *Registration Request* IE set to \"stop\", the *Cell To Report* IE
list shall be ignored.

If the *Registration Request* IE is set to \"start\" then the *Report
Characteristics* IE shall be included in RESOURCE STATUS REQUEST
message. The eNB~2~ shall ignore the *Report Characteristics* IE, if the
*Registration Request* IE is not set to \"start\".

The *Report Characteristics* IE indicates the type of objects eNB~2~
shall perform measurements on. For each cell, the eNB~2~ shall include
in the RESOURCE STATUS UPDATE message:

\- the *Radio* *Resource Status* IE, if the first bit, \"PRB Periodic\"
of the *Report Characteristics* IE included in the RESOURCE STATUS
REQUEST message is set to 1;

\- the ***S1 TNL Load Indicator*** IE, if the second bit, \"TNL Load Ind
Periodic\" of the *Report Characteristics* IE included in the RESOURCE
STATUS REQUEST message is set to 1;

\- the *Hardware Load Indicator* IE, if the third bit, \"HW Load Ind
Periodic\" of the *Report Characteristics* IE included in the RESOURCE
STATUS REQUEST message is set to 1;

\- the *Composite Available Capacity Group* IE, if the fourth bit,
\"Composite Available Capacity Periodic\" of the *Report
Characteristics* IE included in the RESOURCE STATUS REQUEST message is
set to 1. If *Cell Capacity Class Value* IE is included within the
*Composite* *Available Capacity Group* IE, this IE is used to assign
weights to the available capacity indicated in the *Capacity Value* IE;

\- the *ABS Status* IE, if the fifth bit, \"ABS Status Periodic\" of the
*Report Characteristics* IE included in the RESOURCE STATUS REQUEST
message is set to 1 and eNB~1~ had indicated the ABS pattern to eNB~2;~

\- the *RSRP Measurement Report List* IE, if the sixth bit, \"RSRP
Measurement Report Periodic\" of the *Report Characteristics* IE
included in the RESOURCE STATUS REQUEST message is set to 1;

\- the *CSI Report* IE, if the seventh bit, \"CSI Report Periodic\" of
the *Report Characteristics* IE included in the RESOURCE STATUS REQUEST
message is set to 1.

If the *Reporting Periodicity* IE is included in the RESOURCE STATUS
REQUEST message, eNB~2~ shall use its value as the time interval between
two subsequent RESOURCE STATUS UPDATE messages that include the *Radio
Resource Status* IE, *S1 TNL Load Indicator* IE, *Hardware Load
Indicator* IE, *Composite Available Capacity Group* IE, or *ABS Status*
IE.

If the *Reporting Periodicity of RSRP Measurement Report* IE is included
in the RESOURCE STATUS REQUEST message, eNB~2~ shall use its value as
the minimum time interval between two subsequent RESOURCE STATUS UPDATE
messages that include the *RSRP Measurement Report List* IE.

If the *Reporting Periodicity of CSI Report* IE is included in the
RESOURCE STATUS REQUEST message, eNB~2~ shall use its value as the
minimum time interval between two subsequent RESOURCE STATUS UPDATE
messages that include the *CSI Report* IE.

If eNB~2~ is capable to provide all requested resource status
information, it shall initiate the measurement as requested by eNB~1~,
and respond with the RESOURCE STATUS RESPONSE message.

If eNB~2~ is capable to provide some but not all of the requested
resource status information and the *Partial Success Indicator* IE is
present in the RESOURCE STATUS REQUEST message, it shall initiate the
measurement for the admitted measurement objects and include the
*Measurement Initiation Result* IE in the RESOURCE STATUS RESPONSE
message.

#### 8.3.6.3 Unsuccessful Operation

Figure 8.3.6.3-1: Resource Status Reporting Initiation, unsuccessful
operation

If none of the requested measurements can be initiated, eNB~2~ shall
send a RESOURCE STATUS FAILURE message. The *Cause* IE shall be set to
an appropriate value e.g. \"Measurement Temporarily not Available\" or
\"Measurement not Supported For The Object\" for each requested
measurement object. The eNB may use the *Complete Failure Cause
Information* IE to enhance the failure cause information per measurement
in the RESOURCE STATUS FAILURE message.

#### 8.3.6.4 Abnormal Conditions

If the initiating eNB~1~ does not receive either RESOURCE STATUS
RESPONSE message or RESOURCE STATUS FAILURE message, the eNB~1~ may
reinitiate the Resource Status Reporting Initiation procedure towards
the same eNB, provided that the content of the new RESOURCE STATUS
REQUEST message is identical to the content of the previously
unacknowledged RESOURCE STATUS REQUEST message.

If the initiating eNB~1~ receives the RESOURCE STATUS RESPONSE message
including the *Measurement Initiation Result* IE containing no admitted
measurements, the eNB~1~ shall consider the procedure as failed.

If the ***Report Characteristics* IE bitmap is set to** \"**0**\" **(all
bits are set to** \"**0**\"**) in the** RESOURCE STATUS REQUEST message
**then eNB~2~ shall initiate a** RESOURCE STATUS FAILURE message, the
cause shall be set to appropriate value e.g.
\"**ReportCharacteristicsEmpty**\".

If the *Reporting Periodicity* IE value is not specified when at least
one of the bits of the *Report Characteristics* IE, for which semantics
is specified, other than the sixth or seventh bit, is set to 1 **then
eNB~2~ shall initiate a** RESOURCE STATUS FAILURE message, the cause
shall be set to appropriate value e.g. \"**No**ReportPeriodicity\".

If the *Reporting Periodicity of RSRP Measurement Report* IE value is
not specified when the sixth bit of the *Report Characteristics* IE is
set to 1, then eNB~2~ shall initiate the RESOURCE STATUS FAILURE message
and the cause shall be set to appropriate value e.g.
\"NoReportPeriodicity\".

If the *Reporting Periodicity of CSI Report* IE value is not specified
when the seventh bit of the *Report Characteristics* IE is set to 1,
then eNB~2~ shall initiate the RESOURCE STATUS FAILURE message and the
cause shall be set to appropriate value e.g. \"NoReportPeriodicity\".

If the eNB~2~ received a RESOURCE STATUS REQUEST message which includes
the *Registration Request* IE set to \"start\" and the *eNB1Measurement
ID* IE corresponding to an existing on-going load measurement reporting,
**then eNB~2~ shall initiate a** RESOURCE STATUS FAILURE message, the
cause shall be set to appropriate value e.g. \"ExistingMeasurementID\".

If the *Registration Request* IE is set to \"stop\", \"partial stop\" or
\"add\" and the RESOURCE STATUS REQUEST message does not contain *eNB2
Measurement ID* IE, eNB~2~ shall consider the procedure as failed and
respond with the RESOURCE STATUS FAILURE message, the cause shall be set
to appropriate value e.g. \"Unknown eNB Measurement ID\".

If the *Registration Request* IE is set to \"partial stop\" and the
*Cell To Report* IE contains cells that have not been initiated for the
reporting before, eNB~2~ shall consider the procedure as failed and
respond with the RESOURCE STATUS FAILURE message, the cause shall be set
to appropriate value e.g. \"Cell not Available\". If the *Registration
Request* IE is set to \"add\" and the *Cell To Report* IE contains cells
that have been initiated for the reporting before, eNB~2~ shall consider
the procedure as failed and respond with the RESOURCE STATUS FAILURE
message, the cause shall be set to appropriate value e.g. \"Cell not
Available\".

### 8.3.7 Resource Status Reporting

#### 8.3.7.1 General

This procedure is initiated by eNB~2~ to report the result of
measurements admitted by eNB~2~ following a successful Resource Status
Reporting Initiation procedure.

The procedure uses non UE-associated signalling.

#### 8.3.7.2 Successful Operation

Figure 8.3.7.2-1: Resource Status Reporting, successful operation

The eNB~2~ shall report the results of the admitted measurements in
RESOURCE STATUS UPDATE message. The admitted measurements are the
measurements that were successfully initiated during the preceding
Resource Status Reporting Initiation procedure, and thus not reported in
the *Measurement Failed Report Characteristics* IE for the concerned
cell in the RESOURCE STATUS RESPONSE message.

If the eNB~1~ receives the RESOURCE STATUS UPDATE message which includes
the *UE ID* IE in the *RSRP Measurement Report List* IE, the eNB~1~ may
use the *UE ID* IE to link the associated RSRP measurement report with
other measurement results (e.g. CSI reports, RSRP measurement reports)
of the same UE.

If the *CSI Report* IE including the *CSI Process Configuration Index*
IE is received, eNB~1~ shall interpret this IE as an index identifying
one of the CSI process configurations that can be configured for all UEs
within the cell where the CSI measurements were collected. For all UEs
within the cell, the maximum number of CSI process configurations is
given by the maximum value of the *CSI Process Configuration Index* IE.

If the eNB~1~ receives the RESOURCE STATUS UPDATE message, which
includes the *Cell Reporting Indicator* IE set to \"stop request\" in
one or more items of the *Cell Measurement Result* IE, the eNB~1~ should
initialise the Resource Status Reporting Initiation procedure to remove
all or some of the corresponding cells from the measurement.

#### 8.3.7.3 Unsuccessful Operation

Not applicable.

#### 8.3.7.4 Abnormal Conditions

If the eNB~1~ receives a RESOURCE STATUS UPDATE message which includes
the *ABS Status* IE, and all bits in the *Usable ABS Pattern Info* IE
are set to \'0\', the eNB1 shall ignore the *DL ABS Status* IE.

### 8.3.8 Mobility Settings Change

#### 8.3.8.1 General

This procedure enables an eNB to negotiate the handover trigger settings
with a peer eNB controlling neighbouring cells.

The procedure uses non UE-associated signalling.

#### 8.3.8.2 Successful Operation

Figure 8.3.8.2-1: Mobility Settings Change, successful operation

The procedure is initiated with a MOBILITY CHANGE REQUEST message sent
from eNB~1~ to eNB~2~.

Upon receipt, eNB~2~ shall evaluate if the proposed eNB~2~ handover
trigger modification may be accepted. If eNB~2~ is able to successfully
complete the request it shall reply with MOBILITY CHANGE ACKNOWLEDGE.

#### 8.3.8.3 Unsuccessful Operation

Figure 8.3.8.3-1: Mobility Settings Change, unsuccessful operation

If the requested parameter modification is refused by the eNB~2~, or if
the eNB~2~ is not able to complete the procedure, the eNB~2~ shall send
a MOBILITY CHANGE FAILURE message with the *Cause* IE set to an
appropriate value. The eNB~2~ may include *eNB2 Mobility Parameters
Modification Range* IE in MOBILITY CHANGE FAILURE message, for example
in cases when the proposed change is out of permitted range.

#### 8.3.8.4 Abnormal Conditions

Void.

### 8.3.9 Radio Link Failure Indication

#### 8.3.9.1 General

The purpose of the Radio Link Failure Indication procedure is to
transfer information regarding RRC re-establishment attempts, or
received RLF Reports, between eNBs. The signalling takes place from the
eNB at which a re-establishment attempt is made, or an RLF Report is
received, to an eNB to which the UE concerned may have previously been
attached prior to the connection failure. This may aid the detection of
radio link failure and handover failure cases (TS 36.300 \[15\]).

The procedure uses non UE-associated signalling.

#### 8.3.9.2 Successful Operation

Figure 8.3.9.2-1: Radio Link Failure Indication, successful operation

eNB~2~ initiates the procedure by sending the RLF INDICATION message to
eNB~1~ following a re-establishment attempt or an RLF Report reception
from a UE at eNB~2~, when eNB~2~ considers that the UE may have
previously suffered a connection failure at a cell controlled by eNB~1~.

eNB~2~ may include the *ShortMAC-I* IE in the RLF INDICATION message,
e.g., in order to aid the eNB~1~ to resolve a potential PCI confusion
situation or to aid the eNB~1~ to identify the UE.

eNB~2~ may include the *UE RLF Report Container* IE and optionally also
the *UE RLF Report Container for extended bands* IE in the RLF
INDICATION message, which may be used by the eNB~1~ to determine the
nature of the failure. If the *UE RLF Report Container* IE is included
in the RLF INDICATION message sent after successful re-establishment,
the eNB~2~ shall use the *Re-establishment Cell ECGI* IE in the RLF
INDICATION message to indicate the ECGI of the cell where the
re-establishment was successful.

eNB~2~ may include the *RRC Conn Setup Indicator* IE in the RLF
INDICATION message, which indicates that the RLF Report is retrieved
after an RRC connection setup or an incoming successful handover.

If the *RRC Conn Setup Indicator* IE is present in the RLF INDICATION
message, the eNB~1~ shall ignore the values in the *Failure cell PCI*
IE, *Re-establishment cell ECGI* IE, *C-RNTI* IE and *ShortMAC-I* IE.

eNB~2~ may include the *RRC Conn Reestab Indicator* IE in the RLF
INDICATION message, which may be used by the eNB~1~ to determine where
the failure occurred.

eNB~2~ may include the *NB-IoT RLF Report Container* IE in the RLF
INDICATION message, which may be used by the eNB~1~ to determine the
nature of the failure. If the *NB-IoT RLF Report Container* IE is
included in the RLF INDICATION message sent after successful
re-establishment, the eNB~2~ shall use the *Re-establishment Cell ECGI*
IE in the RLF INDICATION message to indicate the ECGI of the cell where
the re-establishment was successful.

#### 8.3.9.3 Unsuccessful Operation

Not applicable.

#### 8.3.9.4 Abnormal Conditions

Void.

### 8.3.10 Handover Report

#### 8.3.10.1 General

The purpose of the Handover Report procedure is to transfer mobility
related information between eNBs.

The procedure uses non UE-associated signalling.

#### 8.3.10.2 Successful Operation

Figure 8.3.10.2-1: Handover Report, successful operation

An eNB initiates the procedure by sending an HANDOVER REPORT message to
another eNB. By sending the message eNB~1~ indicates to eNB~2~ that a
mobility-related problem was detected.

If the *Handover Report Type* IE is set to \"HO too early\" or \"HO to
wrong cell\", then the eNB~1~ indicates to eNB~2~ that, following a
successful handover from a cell of eNB~2~ to a cell of eNB~1~, a radio
link failure occurred and the UE attempted RRC Re-establishment either
at the original cell of eNB~2~ (Handover Too Early), or at another cell
(Handover to Wrong Cell). The detection of Handover Too Early and
Handover to Wrong Cell events is made according to TS 36.300 \[15\].

If the UE-related information is available in eNB~1~, the eNB~1~ should
include in HANDOVER REPORT message:

\- the *Mobility Information* IE, if the *Mobility Information* IE was
sent for this handover from eNB~2~;

\- the *Source cell C-RNTI* IE.

If received, the eNB~2~ uses the above information according to TS
36.300 \[15\].

If the UE RLF Report received from the eNB sending the RLF INDICATION
message, as described in TS 36.300 \[15\], is available, the eNB~1~ may
also include it in the HANDOVER REPORT as *UE RLF Report Container* IE
and optionally also *UE RLF Report Container for extended bands* IE.

If the *Handover Report Type* IE is set to \"InterRAT ping-pong\", then
the eNB~1~ indicates to eNB~2~ that a completed handover from a cell of
eNB~2~ to a cell in other RAT might have resulted in an inter-RAT
ping-pong and the UE was successfully handed over to a cell of eNB~1~
(indicated with the *Failure cell ECGI* IE).

If the *Handover Report Type* IE is set to \"Inter-system ping-pong\",
then the eNB~1~ indicates to eNB~2~ that a completed handover from a
cell of eNB~2~ to a cell in NG-RAN might have resulted in an
inter-system ping-pong and the UE was successfully handed over to a cell
of eNB~1~ (indicated with the *Failure cell ECGI* IE).

The report contains the source and target cells, and cause of the
handover. If the *Handover Report Type* IE is set to \"HO to wrong
cell\", then the *Re-establishment cell ECGI* IE shall be included in
the HANDOVER REPORT message. If the *Handover Report Type* IE is set to
\"InterRAT ping-pong\", then the *Target cell in UTRAN* IE shall be
included in the HANDOVER REPORT message. If the *Handover Report Type*
IE is set to \"Inter-system ping-pong\", then the *Target cell in
NG-RAN* IE shall be included in the HANDOVER REPORT message.

#### 8.3.10.3 Unsuccessful Operation

Not applicable.

#### 8.3.10.4 Abnormal Conditions

Void.

### 8.3.11 Cell Activation

#### 8.3.11.1 General

The purpose of the Cell Activation procedure is to request to a
neighbouring eNB to switch on one or more cells, previously reported as
inactive due to energy saving reasons.

The procedure uses non UE-associated signalling.

#### 8.3.11.2 Successful Operation

Figure 8.3.11.2-1: Cell Activation, successful operation

An eNB~1~ initiates the procedure by sending a CELL ACTIVATION REQUEST
message to a peer eNB~2~.

8.7 Procedures for E-UTRAN-NR Dual Connectivity
-----------------------------------------------

### 8.7.1 EN-DC X2 Setup

#### 8.7.1.1 General

The purpose of the EN-DC X2 Setup procedure is to exchange application
level configuration data needed for eNB and en-gNB to interoperate
correctly over the X2 interface. This procedure erases any existing
application level configuration data in the two nodes and replaces it by
the one received. This procedure also resets the X2 interface like a
Reset procedure would do.

NOTE 1: If X2-C signalling transport is shared among multiple X2-C
interface instances, one EN-DC X2 Setup procedure is issued per X2-C
interface instance to be setup, i.e. several X2 Setup procedures may be
issued via the same TNL association after that TNL association has
become operational.

NOTE 2: Exchange of application level configuration data also applies
between eNB and en-gNB in case the SN (i.e. the en-gNB) does not
broadcast system information other than for radio frame timing and SFN,
as specified in the TS 37.340 \[32\]. How to use this information when
this option is used is not explicitly specified.

The procedure uses non UE-associated signalling.

#### 8.7.1.2 Successful Operation

X2-C signalling transport, as specified in TS 36.300 \[15\], the EN-DC
X2 SETUP REQUEST message and the EN-DC X2 SETUP RESPONSE message shall
include the *Interface Instance Indication* IE to identify the
corresponding interface instance. In the current version of this
specification an eNB shall not include the *Interface Instance
Indication* IE in the *Initiating NodeType* IE in the EN-DC X2 SETUP
REQUEST message.

If the *SFN Offset* IE is included in the EN-DC X2 SETUP REQUEST or
EN-DC X2 SETUP RESPONSE message, the receiving node shall, if supported,
use this information to deduce the SFN0 time offset of the reported
cell. The receiving node shall consider the received *SFN Offset* IE
content valid until reception of an update of the IE for the same
cell(s).

**eNB initiated EN-DC X2 Setup:**

An eNB initiates the procedure by sending the EN-DC X2 SETUP REQUEST
message to a candidate en-gNB. The candidate en-gNB replies with the
EN-DC X2 SETUP RESPONSE message. The initiating eNB shall transfer the
complete list of its served cells to the candidate en-gNB. The candidate
en-gNB shall reply with the complete list of its served cells or if
supported, a partial list of its served cells together with the *Partial
List Indicator* IE, according to the received information in *Cell and
Capacity Assistance Information* IE in EN-DC X2 SETUP REQUEST message.
If Supplementary Uplink is configured at the candidate en-gNB, the
candidate en-gNB shall include in the EN-DC X2 SETUP RESPONSE message
the *SUL Information* IE and the ***Supported SUL band List*** IE for
each served cell where supplementary uplink is configured.

If the EN-DC X2 SETUP REQUEST message contains the ***Protected E-UTRA
Resource Indication*** IE, the receiving en-gNB should take this into
account for cell-level resource coordination with the eNB. The en-gNB
shall consider the received ***Protected E-UTRA Resource Indication***
IE content valid until reception of a new update of the IE for the same
eNB.

The protected resource pattern indicated in the ***Protected E-UTRA
Resource Indication*** IE is not valid in subframes indicated by the
*Reserved Subframes* IE, as well as in the non-control region of the
MBSFN subframes i.e. it is valid only in the control region therein. The
size of the control region of MBSFN subframes is indicated in the
***Protected E-UTRA Resource Indication*** IE.

If the *Partial List Indicator* IE is set to \"partial\" in the EN-DC X2
SETUP RESPONSE message from the en-gNB, the eNB shall, if supported,
assume that the en-gNB has included in the ***List of Served Cells NR***
IE a partial list of cells.

If the EN-DC X2 SETUP REQUEST message contains the *TNL Transport Layer
Address info* IE, the receiving en-gNB shall, if supported, take this
into account for IPSEC tunnel establishment.

**en-gNB initiated EN-DC X2 Setup:**

An en-gNB initiates the procedure by sending the EN-DC X2 SETUP REQUEST
message to a candidate eNB. The candidate eNB replies with the EN-DC X2
SETUP RESPONSE message. The initiating en-gNB shall transfer the
complete list of its served cells or if supported, a partial list of its
served cells together with the *Partial List Indicator* IE in the EN-DC
X2 SETUP REQUEST message to the candidate eNB. The candidate eNB shall
reply with the complete list of its served cells.

If Supplementary Uplink is configured at the en-gNB, the en-gNB shall
include in the EN-DC X2 SETUP REQUEST message the *SUL Information* IE
and the ***Supported SUL band List*** IE for each served cell where
supplementary uplink is configured.

If the EN-DC X2 SETUP RESPONSE message contains the ***Protected E-UTRA
Resource Indication*** IE, the receiving en-gNB should take this into
account for cell-level resource coordination with the eNB. The en-gNB
shall consider the received ***Protected E-UTRA Resource Indication***
IE content valid until reception of a new update of the IE for the same
eNB.

If the *Partial List Indicator* IE is set to \"partial\" in the EN-DC X2
SETUP REQUEST message from the en-gNB, the eNB shall, if supported,
assume that the en-gNB has included in the ***List of Served Cells NR***
IE a partial list of cells.

If the *Cell and Capacity Assistance Information* IE is present in the
EN-DC X2 SETUP RESPONSE message from the eNB, the en-gNB shall, if
supported, store the collected information to be used for future
interface management.

If the EN-DC X2 SETUP REQUEST message contains the *TNL Transport Layer
Address info* IE, the receiving eNB shall, if supported, take this into
account for IPSEC tunnel establishment.

If the EN-DC X2 SETUP RESPONSE message contains the *TNL Transport Layer
Address info* IE, the receiving en-gNB shall, if supported, take this
into account for IPSEC tunnel establishment.

If the *NR Cell PRACH Configuration* IE is included in the *Served NR
Cell Information* IE contained in the EN-DC X2 SETUP REQUEST message,
the eNB may store the information.

If the *CSI-RS Transmision Indication* IE is contained in the EN-DC X2
SETUP REQUEST message, the eNB should take it into account when
forwarding neighbour NR cell's CSI-RS configuration.

If the *Intended TDD DL-UL Configuration NR* IE is contained in the *NR
Neighbour Information* IE in the EN-DC X2 SETUP RESPONSE message, en-gNB
should take this information into account for cross-link interference
management. The en-gNB shall consider the received *Intended TDD DL-UL
Configuration NR* IE content valid until reception of an update of the
IE for the same cell(s).

**Interaction with the eNB Configuration Update procedure:**

The receiving eNB may forward the *Intended TDD DL-UL Configuration NR*
IE received in the *Served NR Cell Information* IE in the EN-DC X2 SETUP
REQUEST message to neighbouring eNBs by triggering the eNB Configuration
Update procedure.

**Interaction with the EN-DC Configuration Update procedure:**

The receiving eNB may forward the *Intended TDD DL-UL Configuration NR*
IE received in the *Served NR Cell Information* IE in the EN-DC X2 SETUP
REQUEST message to neighbouring en-gNBs by triggering the EN-DC

#### 8.7.1.3 Unsuccessful Operation

Figure 8.7.1.3-1: eNB Initiated EN-DC X2 Setup, unsuccessful operation

Figure 8.7.1.3-2: en-gNB Initiated EN-DC X2 Setup, unsuccessful
operation

If the candidate receving node cannot accept the setup it shall respond
with an EN-DC X2 SETUP FAILURE message with appropriate cause value.

If the *Message Oversize Notification* IE is included in the EN-DC X2
SETUP FAILURE, the initiating node shall, if supported, deduce that the
failure is due to a too large EN-DC X2 SETUP REQUEST message and ensure
that the total number of served cells in following EN-DC X2 SETUP
REQUEST message is equal to or lower than the value of the *Message
Oversize Notification* IE.

If case of network sharing with multiple cell ID broadcast with shared
X2-C signalling transport, as specified in TS 36.300 \[15\], the EN-DC
X2 SETUP REQUEST message and the EN-DC X2 SETUP FAILURE message shall
include the *Interface Instance Indication* IE to identify the
corresponding interface instance.

#### 8.7.1.4 Abnormal Conditions

If the first message received for a specific TNL association is not an
EN-DC X2 SETUP REQUEST, EN-DC X2 SETUP RESPONSE, or EN-DC X2 SETUP
FAILURE message then this shall be treated as a logical error.

If the initiating node does not receive either EN-DC X2 SETUP RESPONSE
message or EN-DC X2 SETUP FAILURE message, the initiating node may
reinitiate the EN-DC X2 Setup procedure towards the same candidate node,
provided that the content of the EN-DC X2 SETUP REQUEST message is
identical to the content of the previously unacknowledged EN-DC X2 SETUP
REQUEST message.

If the EN-DC X2 SETUP FAILURE message includes the *Time To Wait* IE the
initiating node shall wait at least for the indicated time before
reinitiating the EN-DC X2 Setup procedure towards the same peer node.

If the initiating node receives an EN-DC X2 SETUP REQUEST message from
the peer entity on the same X2 interface:

\- In case the initiating node answers with an EN-DC X2 SETUP RESPONSE
message and receives a subsequent EN-DC X2 SETUP FAILURE message, the
initiating node shall consider the X2 interface as non operational and
the procedure as unsuccessfully terminated according to sub clause
8.7.1.3.

\- In case the initiating node answers with an EN-DC X2 SETUP FAILURE
message and receives a subsequent EN-DC X2 SETUP RESPONSE message, the
initiating node shall ignore the EN-DC X2 SETUP RESPONSE message and
consider the X2 interface as non operational.

### 8.7.2 EN-DC Configuration Update

#### 8.7.2.1 General

The purpose of the EN-DC Configuration Update procedure is to update
application level configuration data needed for eNB and en-gNB to
interoperate correctly over the X2 interface.

NOTE: Update of application level configuration data also applies
between eNB and en-gNB in case the SN (i.e. the en-gNB) does not
broadcast system information other than for radio frame timing and SFN,
as specified in the TS 37.340 \[32\]. How to use this information when
this option is used is not explicitly specified.

principles described for the E-RAB Setup procedure in TS 36.413 \[4\].

If the SGNB ADDITION REQUEST message contains the *Serving PLMN* IE, the
en-gNB may use it for RRM purposes.

If the SGNB ADDITION REQUEST message contains the *Expected UE
Behaviour* IE, the en-gNB shall, if supported, store this information
and may use it to optimize resource allocation.

If the SGNB ADDITION REQUEST message contains the *Handover Restriction
List* IE, the en-gNB node, if supported, shall store this information
and use it to select an appropriate NR cell.

If the SGNB ADDITION REQUEST message contains the *MeNB Resource
Coordination Information* IE, the en-gNB should forward it to lower
layers and it may use it for the purpose of resource coordination with
the MeNB, or to coordinate with sidelink resources used in the MeNB. The
en-gNB shall consider the received *UL Coordination Information* IE
value valid until reception of a new update of the IE for the same UE.
The en-gNB shall consider the received *DL Coordination Information* IE
value valid until reception of a new update of the IE for the same UE.
If the *MeNB Coordination Assistance Information* IE is contained in the

Upon receipt of the EN-DC RESOURCE STATUS REQUEST message, the en-gNB:

\- shall initiate the requested measurement according to the parameters
given in the request in case the *Registration Request* *EN-DC* IE set
to \"start\"; or

\- shall stop all cells measurements and terminate the reporting in case
the *Registration Request EN-DC* IE is set to \"stop\"; or

\- shall add cells indicated in the *NR* *Cell To Report EN-DC List* IE
list to the measurements initiated before for the given measurement IDs,
in case the *Registration Request EN-DC* IE is set to \"add\". If
measurements are already initiated for a cell indicated in the *NR*
*Cell To Report EN-DC List* IE, this information shall be ignored.

The en-gNB shall send an EN-DC RESOURCE STATUS RESPONSE message to the
eNB to indicate that all of the requested measurement objects the
measurement can be initiated.

**Interaction with other procedures**

When starting a measurement, the *Report Characteristics EN-DC* IE in
the EN-DC RESOURCE STATUS REQUEST indicates the type of objects en-gNB
shall perform measurements on. For each cell, the en-gNB shall include
in the EN-DC RESOURCE STATUS UPDATE message:

\- the *NR Radio* *Resource Status* IE, if the first bit, \"PRB
Periodic\" of the *Report Characteristics EN-DC* IE included in the
EN-DC RESOURCE STATUS REQUEST message is set to \"1\". If the cell for
which *NR Radio* *Resource Status* IE is requested to be reported
supports more than one SSB, the *NR Radio* *Resource Status* IE for such
cell shall include the ***SSB Area Radio Resource Status Item* IE** for
all SSB areas supported by the cell. If the *SSB To Report List* IE is
included for a cell, the *NR Radio* *Resource Status* IE for such cell
shall include the requested ***SSB Area Radio Resource Status List*
IE.**

\- the ***TNL Capacity Indicator*** IE, if the second bit, \"TNL
Capacity Ind Periodic\" of the *Report Characteristics EN-DC* IE
included in the EN-DC RESOURCE STATUS REQUEST message is set to \"1\".
The received ***TNL Capacity Indicator*** IE represents the lowest TNL
capacity available for the cell.

\- the *NR Composite Available Capacity Group* IE, if the third bit,
\"Composite Available Capacity Periodic\" of the *Report Characteristics
EN-DC* IE included in the EN-DC RESOURCE STATUS REQUEST message is set
to \"1\". If *Cell Capacity Class Value* IE is included within the *NR
Composite* *Available Capacity Group* IE, this IE is used to assign
weights to the available capacity indicated in the *Capacity Value* IE.
If the cell for which *NR Composite Available Capacity Group* IE is
requested to be reported supports more than one SSB, and if the *SSB To
Report List* IE is included for a cell, the *NR Composite Available
Capacity Group* IE for such cell shall include the requested ***SSB Area
Capacity Value List* IE, providing the SSB area capacity with respect to
the Cell Capacity Class Value.**

If the *Reporting Periodicity EN-DC* IE in the EN-DC RESOURCE STATUS
REQUEST is present, this indicates the periodicity for the reporting of
periodic measurements. The en-gNB shall only report more than once if
the *Reporting Periodicity EN-DC* IE is included.

##### 8.7.21.2.2 Successful Operation - en-gNB-initiated

Figure 8.7.21.2-2: EN-DC Resource Status Reporting Initiation,
successful operation - en-gNB-initiated

The procedure is initiated with an EN-DC RESOURCE STATUS REQUEST message
sent from the en-gNB to the eNB to start a measurement, stop a
measurement, add cells to report for a measurement.

If the *Report Characteristics EN-DC* IE is included in the EN-DC
RESOURCE STATUS REQUEST message and indicates cell specific
measurements, the *E-UTRA Cell To Report EN-DC* *List* IE shall be
included.

Upon receipt of the EN-DC RESOURCE STATUS REQUEST message, the eNB:

\- shall initiate the requested measurement according to the parameters
given in the request in case the *Registration Request EN-DC* IE set to
\"start\"; or

\- shall stop all cells measurements and terminate the reporting in case
the *Registration Request EN-DC* IE is set to \"stop\"; or

\- shall add cells indicated in the *E-UTRA Cell To Report EN-DC List*
IE list to the measurements initiated before for the given measurement
IDs, in case the *Registration Request EN-DC* IE is set to \"add\". If
measurements are already initiated for a cell indicated in the *E-UTRA
Cell To Report EN-DC List* IE, this information shall be ignored. The
eNB shall ignore the *E-UTRA Cell To Report EN-DC List* IE, if included.

The eNB shall send an EN-DC RESOURCE STATUS RESPONSE message to the
en-gNB to indicate that all of the requested measurement objects the
measurement can be initiated.

**Interaction with other procedures, en-gNB-initiated operation**

When starting a measurement, the *Report Characteristics EN-DC* IE in
the EN-DC RESOURCE STATUS REQUEST indicates the type of objects eNB
shall perform measurements on. For each cell, the eNB shall include in
the EN-DC RESOURCE STATUS UPDATE message:

\- the *Radio* *Resource Status* IE, if the first bit, \"PRB Periodic\"
of the *Report Characteristics EN-DC* IE included in the RESOURCE STATUS
REQUEST message is set to \"1\";

\- the ***S1 TNL Load Indicator*** IE, if the second bit, \"TNL Load Ind
Periodic\" of the *Report Characteristics EN-DC* IE included in the
RESOURCE STATUS REQUEST message is set to \"1\";

\- the *Hardware Load Indicator* IE, if the third bit, \"HW Load Ind
Periodic\" of the *Report Characteristics EN-DC* IE included in the
RESOURCE STATUS REQUEST message is set to \"1\";

\- the *Composite Available Capacity Group* IE, if the fourth bit,
\"Composite Available Capacity Periodic\" of the *Report Characteristics
EN-DC* IE included in the RESOURCE STATUS REQUEST message is set to
\"1\". If the *Cell Capacity Class Value* IE is included within the
*Composite* *Available Capacity Group* IE, this IE is used to assign
weights to the available capacity indicated in the *Capacity Value* IE;

If the *Reporting Periodicity EN-DC* IE in the EN-DC RESOURCE STATUS
REQUEST is present, this indicates the periodicity for the reporting of
periodic measurements. The eNB shall only report more than once if the
*Reporting Periodicity EN-DC* IE is included.

#### 9.1.1.4 SN STATUS TRANSFER

This message is sent by the source eNB to the target eNB to transfer the
uplink/downlink PDCP SN and HFN status during a handover or for EN-DC.

Direction: source eNB → target eNB (handover), eNB from which the E-RAB
context is transferred → eNB to which the E-RAB context is transferred
(RRC connection re-establishment or dual connectivity), MeNB/en-gNB from
which the E-RAB context is transferred → en-gNB/MeNB to which the E-RAB
context is transferred (EN-DC).

#### 9.1.1.9 EARLY STATUS TRANSFER 

This message is sent by the source eNB to the target eNB to transfer the
COUNT value related to the forwarded downlink SDUs during DAPS Handover
or Conditional Handover.

During a Conditional Handover with EN-DC or Dual Connectivity, this
message is also used to transfer the COUNT value related to the
forwarded downlink SDUs. In case of EN-DC, the COUNT value is
transferred from the en-gNB to the eNB, while in case of Dual
Connectivity, the COUNT value is transferred from the SeNB to the MeNB.

Direction: source eNB → target eNB (DAPS Handover or Conditional
Handover).

Direction: en-gNB → MeNB (Conditional Handover with EN-DC), SeNB → MeNB
(Conditional Handover with Dual Connectivity)

NOTE 1: The ASN.1 definition of the RETRIEVE UE CONTEXT REQUEST message
contains the a wrong IE-Id, which references the *SeNB UE X2AP ID
Extension* IE instead of the *New eNB UE X2AP ID Extension* IE. The old
eNB interprets the content of this IE as the Extended eNB UE X2AP ID,
which, together with the *New eNB UE X2AP ID* IE represents the eNB UE
X2AP ID allocated at the new eNB.

#### 9.1.2.29 RETRIEVE UE CONTEXT RESPONSE

This message is sent by the old eNB to transfer the UE context to the
new eNB.

Direction: old eNB → new eNB.

#### 9.1.2.43 DATA FORWARDING ADDRESS INDICATION

This message is sent by the new eNB to indicate to the old eNB
forwarding addresses for each E-RAB for which it admits data forwarding.

During a Conditional Handover with EN-DC or Dual Connectivity, this
message is also used to provide data forwarding related information. In
case of EN-DC, the data forwarding related information is transferred
from the eNB to the en-gNB, while in case of Dual Connectivity, the data
forwarding related information is transferred from the MeNB to the SeNB.

Direction: new eNB → old eNB.

Direction: MeNB → en-gNB (Conditional Handover with EN-DC), MeNB → SeNB
(Conditional Handover with Dual Connectivity)

9.2 Information Element definitions
-----------------------------------

### 9.2.0 General

When specifying information elements which are to be represented by bit
strings, if not otherwise specifically stated in the semantics
description of the concerned IE or elsewhere, the following principle
applies with regards to the ordering of bits:

\- The first bit (leftmost bit) contains the most significant bit (MSB);

\- The last bit (rightmost bit) contains the least significant bit
(LSB);

\- When importing bit strings from other specifications, the first bit
of the bit string contains the first bit of the concerned information.

### 9.2.1 GTP Tunnel Endpoint

The *GTP Tunnel Endpoint* IE identifies an X2 transport bearer or the
S-GW endpoint of the S1 transport bearer associated to an E-RAB. It
contains a Transport Layer Address and a GTP Tunnel Endpoint Identifier.
The Transport Layer Address is an IP address to be used for the X2 user
plane transport (see TS 36.424 \[8\]) or for the S1 user plane transport
(see TS 36.414 \[19\]). The GTP Tunnel Endpoint Identifier is to be used
for the user plane transport. The QoS Mapping Information is used to set
the IP header of packets in case that the en-gNB serves the IAB, and the
packets belonging to MN-terminated split bearer/SCG bearer are
transmitted from MeNB to en-gNB.

The meaning of the different cause values is described in the following
table. In general, \"not supported\" cause values indicate that the
concerned capability is missing. On the other hand, \"not available\"
cause values indicate that the concerned capability is present, but
insufficient resources were available to perform the requested action.

|                                  | handover cancellation. The       |
|                                  | target eNB did not admit all     |

| Resource Optimisation Handover   | The reason for requesting        |
|                                  | handover is to improve the load  |

### 9.2.10 GBR QoS Information

This IE indicates the maximum and guaranteed bit rates of a GBR E-RAB
for downlink and uplink.

NOTE: For LTE DC, the SeNB regards the *GBR QoS Information* IE as an
E-RAB level parameter also for E-RABs configured with the split bearer
option, although for the split bearer option the bitrates signalled by
the MeNB are typically not equal to the bitrates signalled by the MME
for that E-RAB (see TS 36.300 \[15\]).

### 9.2.11 Bit Rate

This IE indicates the number of bits delivered by E-UTRAN in UL or to
E-UTRAN in DL or by UE in sidelink within a period of time, divided by
the duration of the period. It is used, for example, to indicate the
maximum or guaranteed bit rate for a GBR E-RAB, or an aggregated maximum
bit rate.

### 9.2.12 UE Aggregate Maximum Bit Rate

On Handover Aggregate Maximum Bitrate is transferred to the target eNB.
In Dual Connectivity, UE Aggregate Maximum Bit Rate is split into MeNB
UE Aggregate Maximum Bit Rate and SeNB UE Aggregate Maximum Bit Rate
which are enforced by MeNB and SeNB respectively as specified in TS
36.300 \[15\]. The UE Aggregate Maximum Bitrate is applicable for all
Non-GBR bearers per UE which is defined for the Downlink and the Uplink
direction and provided by the MME to the eNB.

### 9.2.47 Capacity Value

The *Capacity Value* IE indicates the amount of resources that are
available relative to the total E-UTRAN resources. The capacity value
should be measured and reported so that the minimum E-UTRAN resource
usage of existing services is reserved according to implementation. The
*Capacity Value* IE can be weighted according to the ratio of cell
capacity class values, if available.

### 9.2.48 Mobility Parameters Information

The *Mobility Parameters Information* IE contains the change of the
Handover Trigger as compared to its current value. The Handover Trigger
corresponds to the threshold at which a cell initialises the handover
preparation procedure towards a specific neighbour cell. Positive value
of the change means the handover is proposed to take place later.

For MBSFN subframes, **the exception refers only to the non-control region of the subframe.** The bit string may span across multiple contiguous subframes. The first position of the Subframe Configuration IE corresponds to the receiving node\'s subframe 0 in a receiving node\'s radio frame where SFN = Activation SFN. The IE is ignored if received by the eNB.

### 9.2.166 NR Capacity Value

The *NR Capacity Value* IE indicates the amount of resources per cell
and per SSB area that are available relative to the total en-gNB
resources. The capacity value should be measured and reported so that
the minimum en-gNB resource usage of existing services is reserved
according to implementation. The *NR Capacity Value* IE can be weighted
according to the ratio of cell capacity class values, if available.

9.3 Message and Information Element Abstract Syntax (with ASN.1)
----------------------------------------------------------------

### 9.3.1 General

X2AP ASN.1 definition conforms to ITU-T Rec. X.680 \[27\] and ITU-T Rec.
X.681 \[28\].

Sub clause 9.3 presents the Abstract Syntax of the X2AP protocol with
ASN.1. In case there is contradiction between the ASN.1 definition in
this sub clause and the tabular format in sub clause 9.1 and 9.2, the
ASN.1 shall take precedence, except for the definition of conditions for
the presence of conditional elements, in which the tabular format shall
take precedence.

The ASN.1 definition specifies the structure and content of X2AP
messages. X2AP messages can contain any IEs specified in the object set
definitions for that message without the order or number of occurrence
being restricted by ASN.1. However, for this version of the standard, a
sending entity shall construct an X2AP message according to the PDU
definitions module and with the following additional rules:

\- IEs shall be ordered (in an IE container) in the order they appear in
object set definitions.

\- Object set definitions specify how many times IEs may appear. An IE
shall appear exactly once if the presence field in an object has value
\"mandatory\". An IE may appear at most once if the presence field in an
object has value \"optional\" or \"conditional\". If in a tabular format
there is multiplicity specified for an IE (i.e. an IE list) then in the
corresponding ASN.1 definition the list definition is separated into two
parts. The first part defines an IE container list in which the list
elements reside. The second part defines list elements. The IE container
list appears as an IE of its own. For this version of the standard an IE
container list may contain only one kind of list elements.

NOTE: In the above, \"IE\" means an IE in the object set with an
explicit ID. If one IE needs to appear more than once in one object set,
then the different occurrences have different IE IDs.

If an X2AP message that is not constructed as defined above is received,
this shall be considered as Abstract Syntax Error, and the message shall
be handled as defined for Abstract Syntax Error in clause 10.

### 9.3.2 Usage of Private Message Mechanism for Non-standard Use

The private message mechanism for non-standard use may be used:

\- for special operator (and/or vendor) specific features considered not
to be part of the basic functionality, i.e. the functionality required
for a complete and high-quality specification in order to guarantee
multivendor inter-operability.

\- by vendors for research purposes, e.g. to implement and evaluate new
algorithms/features before such features are proposed for
standardisation.

The private message mechanism shall not be used for basic functionality.
Such functionality shall be standardised.
