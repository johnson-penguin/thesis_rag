3 Definitions, symbols and abbreviations
========================================

3.1 Definitions
---------------

For the purposes of the present document, the terms and definitions
given in TR 21.905 \[1\] and the following apply. A term defined in the
present document takes precedence over the definition of the same term,
if any, in TR 21.905 \[1\].

**Carrier: The modulated waveform conveying the E-UTRA or UTRA physical
channels**

**Channel bandwidth:** The RF bandwidth supporting a single E-UTRA RF
carrier with the transmission bandwidth configured in the uplink or
downlink of a cell. The channel bandwidth is measured in MHz and is used
as a reference for transmitter and receiver RF requirements.

**Channel edge:** The lowest and highest frequency of the E-UTRA
carrier, separated by the channel bandwidth.

**Donor coupling loss:** is the coupling loss between the repeater and
the donor base station.

**Downlink**: Signal path where base station transmits and mobile
receives.

**Downlink operating band:** The part of the operating band designated
for downlink.

**Maximum output power, Pmax:** This is the mean power level per carrier
measured at the antenna connector of the Repeater in specified reference
condition.

**Operating band:** A frequency range in which E-UTRA operates (paired
or unpaired), that is defined with a specific set of technical
requirements**.**

NOTE1: The operating band(s) for an E-UTRA Repeater is declared by the
manufacturer according to the designations in clause 5.5 table 5.5-1.

NOTE2: Unless specified, operating band refers to the uplink operating
band and downlink operating band.

**Output power, Pout:** This is the mean power of one carrier at maximum
repeater gain delivered to a load with resistance equal to the nominal
load impedance of the transmitter.

**Pass band:** The frequency range in which the repeater operates in
with operational configuration. This frequency range can correspond to
one or several consecutive nominal channels. If they are not consecutive
each subset of channels shall be considered as an individual pass band.
A repeater can have one or several pass bands.

**Rated output power:** Rated output power of the repeater is the mean
power level per carrier that the manufacturer has declared to be
available at the antenna connector.

**Repeater:** A device that receives, amplifies and transmits the
radiated or conducted RF carrier both in the downlink direction (from
the base station to the mobile area) and in the uplink direction (from
the mobile to the base station) ~~In operating bands with one exclusive
link direction, only the dedicated link direction is repeated.~~

In operating bands specified with only down-link or up-link, only the
up-link or down-link as specified for the operating band is repeated.

**Transmission bandwidth:** Bandwidth of an instantaneous transmission
from a UE or BS, measured in Resource Block units.

**Transmission bandwidth configuration:** The highest transmission
bandwidth allowed for uplink or downlink in a given channel bandwidth,
measured in Resource Block units.

**Uplink:** Signal path where mobile transmits and base station
receives.

**Uplink operating band:** The part of the operating band designated for
uplink.

4.1 Relationship between Minimum Requirements and Test Requirements
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The Minimum Requirements given in this specification make no allowance
for measurement uncertainty. The test specification TS 36.143 \[4\]
Annex B defines Test Tolerances. These Test Tolerances are individually
calculated for each test. The Test Tolerances are used to relax the
Minimum Requirements in this specification to create Test Requirements.

The measurement results returned by the Test System are compared -
without any modification - against the Test Requirements as defined by
the shared risk principle.

The Shared Risk principle is defined in ITU-R M.1545 \[3\].

4.2 Regional requirements
-------------------------

Some requirements in the present document may only apply in certain
regions either as optional requirements or set by local and regional
regulation as mandatory requirements. It is normally not stated in the
3GPP specifications under what exact circumstances that the requirements
apply, since this is defined by local or regional regulation.

Table 4.2-1 lists all requirements that may be applied differently in
different regions.

Figure 5.6-1 shows the relation between the Channel bandwidth
(BW~Channel~) and the Transmission bandwidth configuration (N~RB~). The
channel edges are defined as the lowest and highest frequencies of the
carrier separated by the channel bandwidth, i.e. at F~C~ +/- BW~Channel~
/2.

5.7 Channel arrangement
-----------------------

### 5.7.1 Channel spacing

The spacing between carriers will depend on the deployment scenario, the
size of the frequency block available and the channel bandwidths. The
nominal channel spacing between two adjacent E-UTRA carriers is defined
as following:

Nominal Channel spacing = (BW~Channel(1)~ + BW~Channel(2)~)/2

where BW~Channel(1)~ and BW~Channel(2)~ are the channel bandwidths of
the two respective E-UTRA carriers. The channel spacing can be adjusted
to optimize performance in a particular deployment scenario.

### 5.7.2 Channel raster

The channel raster is 100 kHz for all bands, which means that the
carrier centre frequency must be an integer multiple of 100 kHz.

### 5.7.3 Carrier frequency and EARFCN

The carrier frequency in the uplink and downlink is designated by the
E-UTRA Absolute Radio Frequency Channel Number (EARFCN) in the range 0 -
65535. The relation between EARFCN and the carrier frequency in MHz for
the downlink is given by the following equation, where F~DL\_low~ and
N~Offs-DL~ are given in table 5.7.3-1 and N~DL~ is the downlink EARFCN.

F~DL~ = F~DL\_low~ + 0.1(N~DL~ -- N~Offs-DL~)

The relation between EARFCN and the carrier frequency in MHz for the
uplink is given by the following equation where F~UL\_low~ and
N~Offs-UL~ are given in table 5.7.3-1 and N~UL~ is the uplink EARFCN.

F~UL~ = F~UL\_low~ + 0.1(N~UL~ -- N~Offs-UL~)

6 Output power
==============

Output power, Pout, of the repeater is the mean power of one carrier at
maximum repeater gain delivered to a load with resistance equal to the
nominal load impedance of the transmitter.

Maximum output power, Pmax, of the repeater is the mean power level per
carrier measured at the antenna connector in a specified reference
condition.

6.1 Minimum requirement
-----------------------

The requirements shall apply at maximum gain, with E-UTRA signals in the
pass band of the repeater, at levels that produce the maximum rated
output power per channel.

When the power of all signals is increased by 10 dB, compared to the
power level that produce the maximum rated output power, the
requirements shall still be met.

In normal conditions, the Repeater maximum output power shall remain
within limits specified in Table 6.1-1 relative to the manufacturer\'s
rated output power.

Table 6.1-1: Repeater output power; normal conditions

  -------------------- -----------------
  Rated output power   Limit
  P ≥ 31 dBm           +2 dB and -2 dB
  P \< 31 dBm          +3 dB and -3 dB
  -------------------- -----------------

In extreme conditions, the Repeater maximum output power shall remain
within the limits specified in Table 6.1-2 relative to the
manufacturer\'s rated output power.

Table 6.1-2: Repeater output power; extreme conditions

  -------------------- ---------------------
  Rated output power   Limit
  P ≥ 31 dBm           +2,5 dB and -2,5 dB
  P \< 31 dBm          +4 dB and -4 dB
  -------------------- ---------------------

In certain regions, the minimum requirement for normal conditions may
apply also for some conditions outside the ranges of conditions defined
as normal.

7 Frequency stability
=====================

Frequency stability is the ability to maintain the same frequency on the
output signal with respect to the input signal.

7.1 Minimum requirement
-----------------------

The frequency deviation of the output signal with respect to the input
signal shall be no more than ±0,01 PPM.

8 Out of band gain
==================

Out of band gain refers to the gain of the repeater outside the pass
band.

8.1 Minimum requirement
-----------------------

The intended use of a repeater in a system is to amplify the in band
signals and not to amplify the out of band emission of the donor base
station.

In the intended application of the repeater, the out of band gain is
less than the donor coupling loss.

The repeater minimum donor coupling loss shall be declared by the
manufacturer. This is the minimum required attenuation between the donor
BS and the repeater for proper repeater operation.

The gain outside the pass band shall not exceed the maximum level
specified in table 8.1-1, where:

\- f\_offset\_CW is the offset between the outer channel edge frequency
of the outer channel in the pass band and a CW signal.

Table 8.1-1: Out of band gain limits 1

  --------------------------------- --------------
  Frequency offset, f\_offset\_CW   Maximum gain
  0,2 ≤ f\_offset\_CW \< 1,0 MHz    60 dB
  1,0 ≤ f\_offset\_CW \< 5,0 MHz    45 dB
  5,0 ≤ f\_offset\_CW \< 10,0 MHz   45 dB
  10,0 MHz ≤ f\_offset\_CW          35 dB
  --------------------------------- --------------

For 10,0 MHz ≤ f\_offset\_CW the out of band gain shall not exceed the
maximum gain of table 8.1-2 or the maximum gain stated in table 8.1-1
whichever is lower.

Table 8.1-2: Out of band gain limits 2

  --------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------
  Frequency offset, f\_offset\_CW   Maximum gain
  10 MHz ≤ f\_offset\_CW            Out of band gain ≤ minimum donor coupling loss
  --------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------

9 Unwanted emissions
====================

Unwanted emissions consist of out-of-band emissions and spurious
emissions \[2\]. Out of band emissions are unwanted emissions
immediately outside the pass band bandwidth resulting from the
modulation process and non-linearity in the transmitter, but excluding
spurious emissions. Spurious emissions are emissions which are caused by
unwanted transmitter effects such as harmonics emission, parasitic
emission, intermodulation products and frequency conversion products,
but exclude out of band emissions.

The out-of-band emissions requirement for repeater is specified both in
terms operating band unwanted emissions and protection of the BS
receiver in the uplink operating band. The Operating band unwanted
emissions define all unwanted emissions in the repeater operating band
plus the frequency ranges 10 MHz above and 10 MHz below that band.
Unwanted emissions outside of this frequency range are limited by a
spurious emissions requirement.

9.1 Operating band unwanted emissions
-------------------------------------

The Operating band unwanted emission limits are defined from 10 MHz
below the lowest frequency of the repeater operating band up to 10 MHz
above the highest frequency of the repeater operating band.

The requirements shall apply whatever the type of repeater considered
(single carrier or multi-carrier) and for all configurations foreseen by
the manufacturer\'s specification.

Emissions shall not exceed the maximum levels specified in the tables
below, where:

\- ∆f is the separation between the nominal pass band edge frequency and
the nominal -3dB point of the measuring filter closest to the carrier
frequency.

\- BW~Meas~ is the measurement bandwidth.

\- BW~Pass\ band~ is the bandwidth of the repeater' s pass band.

\- f\_offset is the separation between the nominal pass band edge
frequency and the centre of the measuring filter.

\- f\_offset~max~ is the offset to the frequency 10 MHz outside the
repeater operating band.

\- ∆f~max~ is equal to f\_offset~max~ minus half of the bandwidth of the
measuring filter.

The requirements of either subclause 9.1.1 (Category A limits) or
subclause 9.1.2 (Category B limits) shall apply.\
The application of either Category A or Category B limits shall be the
same as for spurious emissions (Mandatory Requirements) in subclause
9.2.1.

The Additional operating band unwanted emission limits defined in
subclause 9.1.3 below may be mandatory in certain regions. In other
regions it may not apply.

Unless otherwise stated, all requirements are measured as mean power
(RMS).

### 9.1.1 Operating band unwanted emissions (Category A)

#### 9.1.1.1 Minimum Requirements

This requirement applies to the uplink and downlink of the repeater, at
maximum gain, and with the following input signals:

\- without E‑UTRA input signal

\- with E‑UTRA input signals in the pass band of the repeater, at levels
that produce the maximum rated power output per channel

\- with 10 dB increased E‑UTRA input signals in all channels in the pass
band, compared to the input level producing the maximum rated output
power.

For E-UTRA FDD repeater operating in Bands 5, 6, 8, 12, 13, 14, 17, 18,
19, 26, 27, 28, 29, 31 and 72 emissions shall not exceed the maximum
levels specified in Tables 9.1.1.1-1 and 9.1.1.1-2.

### 9.1.2 Operating band unwanted emissions (Category B)

#### 9.1.2.1 Minimum Requirement

For Category B Operating band unwanted emissions, there are two options
for the limits that may be applied regionally. Either the limits in
subclause 9.1.2.1.1 or subclause 9.1.2.1.2 shall be applied.

This requirement applies to the uplink and downlink of the repeater, at
maximum gain, and with the following input signals:

\- without E‑UTRA input signal

\- with E‑UTRA input signals in the pass band of the repeater, at levels
that produce the maximum rated power output per channel

\- with 10 dB increased E‑UTRA input signals in all channels in the pass
band, compared to the input level producing the maximum rated output
power.

##### 9.1.2.1.1 Category B requirements (Option 1)

For E-UTRA FDD repeater operating in Bands 5, 6, 8, 12, 13, 14, 17, 20,
26, 27, 28, 29, 31 and 72 emissions shall not exceed the maximum levels
specified in Tables 9.1.2.1.1-1 and 9.1.2.1.1-2:

### 9.1.3 Additional requirements

These requirements may be applied for the protection of other systems
operating inside or near the E-UTRA Repeater downlink operating band.
The limits may apply as an optional protection of such systems that are
deployed in the same geographical area as the E-UTRA, or they may be set
by local or regional regulation as a mandatory requirement for an E-UTRA
operating band. It is in some cases not stated in the present document
whether a requirement is mandatory or under what exact circumstances
that a limit applies, since this is set by local or regional regulation.
An overview of regional requirements in the present document is given in
subclause 4.2.

In certain regions the following requirement may apply. For E-UTRA FDD
repeaters operating in Band 5, 26, 27 or 28, emissions shall not exceed
the maximum levels specified in Table 9.1.3-1.

Note: The regional requirement is defined in terms of EIRP (effective
isotropic radiated power), which is dependent on both the repeater
emissions at the antenna connector and the deployment (including antenna
gain and feeder loss). The requirement defined above provides the
characteristics of the repeater needed to verify compliance with the
regional requirement. Compliance with the regional requirement can be
determined using the method outlined in TS.36.104 \[6\] Annex G.

This requirement may be applied for the protection in bands adjacent to
bands 1, as defined in clause 5.5 in geographic areas in which both an
adjacent band service and E-UTRA are deployed.

The requirement applies only to the down-link direction of the repeater.

The power of any spurious emission shall not exceed:

In regions where FCC regulation applies, requirements for protection of
GPS according to FCC Order DA 10-534 applies for operation in Band 24.
The following normative requirement covers the Repeater to be used
together with other information about the site installation to verify
compliance with the requirement in FCC Order DA 10-534. The requirement
applies to repeater operating in Band 24 to ensure that appropriate
interference protection is provided to the 1559 -- 1610 MHz band. This
requirement applies to the frequency range 1559-1610 MHz even though
part of this range falls within the operating band unwanted emissions
domain.

The level of emissions in the 1559 -- 1610 MHz band, measured in
measurement bandwidth according to Table 6.6.4.3.1-4 shall not exceed
the maximum emission levels P~E\_1MHz~ and P~E\_1kHz~ declared by the
manufacturer.

Note: The regional requirement in FCC Order DA 10-534 is defined in
terms of EIRP (effective isotropic radiated power), which is dependent
on both the repeater emissions at the antenna connector and the
deployment (including antenna gain and feeder loss). The EIRP level is
calculated using: P~EIRP~ = P~E~ + G~ant~ where P~E~ denotes the
Repeater unwanted emission level at the antenna connector, G~ant~ equals
the Repeater antenna gain minus feeder loss. The requirement defined
above provides the characteristics of the Repeater needed to verify
compliance with the regional requirement.

In certain regions, the following requirements may apply to E-UTRA
repeaters operating in Band 32 within 1452-1492 MHz. The level of
unwanted emissions, measured on centre frequencies f\_offset with filter
bandwidth, according to Table 9.1.3-6 shall neither exceed the maximum
emission level P~EM,B32,a\ ,~ P~EM,B32,b~ nor P~EM,B32,c~ declared by
the manufacturer.

NOTE: The regional requirement, included in \[9\], is defined in terms
of EIRP per antenna, which is dependent on both the repeater emissions
at the antenna connector and the deployment (including antenna gain and
feeder loss). The requirement defined above provides the characteristics
of the base station needed to verify compliance with the regional
requirement. The assessment of the EIRP level is described in Annex H of
TS36.104 \[6\].

In certain regions, the following requirement may apply to E-UTRA
repeaters operating in Band 32 within 1452-1492 MHz for the protection
of services in spectrum adjacent to the frequency range 1452-1492 MHz.
The level of emissions, measured on centre frequencies F~filter~ with
filter bandwidth according to Table 9.1.3-7 shall neither exceed the
maximum emission level P~EM,B32,d~ nor P~EM,B32,e~ declared by the
manufacturer. This requirement applies in the frequency range 1429-1518
MHz even though part of the range falls in the spurious domain.

  ------------------------------------- --------------------------------- -----------------------

NOTE: The regional requirement, included in \[9\], is defined in terms
of EIRP, which is dependent on both the repeater emissions at the
antenna connector and the deployment (including antenna gain and feeder
loss). The requirement defined above provides the characteristics of the
base station needed to verify compliance with the regional requirement.
The assessment of the EIRP level is described in Annex H of TS36.104
\[6\].

The following notes are common to all subclauses in 9.1.3

NOTE 1: As a general rule for the requirements in Clause 9.1.3, the
resolution bandwidth of the measuring equipment should be equal to the
measurement bandwidth. However, to improve measurement accuracy,
sensitivity and efficiency, the resolution bandwidth may be smaller than
the measurement bandwidth. When the resolution bandwidth is smaller than
the measurement bandwidth, the result should be integrated over the
measurement bandwidth in order to obtain the equivalent noise bandwidth
of the measurement bandwidth.

NOTE 2: For signal bandwidths between the values given in Table\'s
9.1.3-1 and 9.1.3-2, the requirements can be calculated by linearly
interpolating between the requirements closest to the wanted signal
bandwidth.

### 9.1.4. Protection of the BS receiver in the operating band

This requirement shall be applied for the protection of E-UTRA FDD BS
receiver in geographic areas in which E-UTRA-FDD Repeater and E-UTRA-FDD
BS are deployed.

The requirement applies at frequencies that are more than 10 MHz below
or more than 10 MHz above the repeater pass band.

#### 9.1.4.1 Minimum Requirement

This requirement applies to the uplink of the repeater, at maximum gain.

The power of any operating band unwanted emission shall not exceed the
limits in Table 9.1.4.1-1.

Table 9.1.4.1-1: Uplink operating band unwanted emissions limits for
protection of the BS receiver

  --------------- ----------------------- ------
  Maximum Level   Measurement Bandwidth   Note
  -53 dBm         100 kHz                 
  --------------- ----------------------- ------

NOTE 1: These requirements in Table 9.1.4.1-1: for the uplink direction
of the Repeater reflect what can be achieved with present state of the
art technology and are based on a coupling loss of 73 dB between a
Repeater and an E-UTRA FDD BS receiver.

NOTE 2: The requirements shall be reconsidered when the state of the art
technology progresses.

NOTE 3: The protection of R-GSM is for further study.

9.2 Spurious emissions
----------------------

The spurious emission limits apply from 9 kHz to 12.75 GHz, (or above,
as indicated in Table 9.2.1.1.1-1 and 9.2.1.2.1-1), excluding the
frequency range from 10 MHz below the lowest frequency of the repeaters
operating band up to 10 MHz above the highest frequency of the repeaters
operating band. Exceptions are the requirement in Table 9.2.2.1-2 and
9.2.2.1-3 that apply also closer than 10 MHz from repeaters operating
band.

The requirements shall apply whatever the type of repeater considered
(one or several pass bands). It applies for all configurations foreseen
by the manufacturer\'s specification.

Unless otherwise stated, all requirements are measured as mean power
(RMS).

### 9.2.1 Mandatory requirements

The requirements of either subclause 9.2.1.1 (Category A limits) or
subclause 9.2.1.2 (Category B limits) shall apply. The application of
either Category A or Category B limits shall be the same as for
Operating band unwanted emissions in subclause 9.1.

The requirements of either subclause 9.2.1.1 or subclause 9.2.1.2 apply
to the uplink and downlink of the repeater, at maximum gain, and with
the following input signals:

\- without E‑UTRA input signal

\- with E‑UTRA input signals in the pass band of the repeater, at levels
that produce the maximum rated power output per channel

\- with 10 dB increased E‑UTRA input signals in all channels in the pass
band, compared to the input level producing the maximum rated output
power.

#### 9.2.1.1 Spurious emissions (Category A)

##### 9.2.1.1.1 Minimum Requirement

The power of any spurious emission shall not exceed the limits in Table
9.2.1.1.1-1.

### 9.2.2 Co-existence with other systems in the same geographical area

These requirements may be applied for the protection of system operating
in frequency ranges other than the E-UTRA Repeater operating band. The
limits may apply as an optional protection of such systems that are
deployed in the same geographical area as the E-UTRA Repeater, or they
may be set by local or regional regulation as a mandatory requirement
for an E-UTRA operating band. It is in some cases not stated in the
present document whether a requirement is mandatory or under what exact
circumstances that a limit applies, since this is set by local or
regional regulation. An overview of regional requirements in the present
document is given in Clause 4.2.

Some requirements may apply for the protection of specific equipment
(UE, MS and/or BS) or equipment operating in specific systems (GSM,
UTRA, E-UTRA, etc.) as listed below.

#### 9.2.2.1 Minimum requirement

Unless otherwise stated this requirement applies to the uplink and
downlink of the repeater, at maximum gain.

The power of any spurious emission shall not exceed the limits of Table
9.2.2.1-1 for an E-UTRA Repeater where requirements for co-existence
with the system listed in the first column apply.

NOTE 1: As defined in the scope for spurious emissions in this clause,
the co-existence requirements in Table 9.2.2.1-1 do not apply for the 10
MHz frequency range immediately outside the repeaters operating band
frequency range of an operating band (see Table 5.5-1). This is also the
case when the repeaters operating band frequency range is adjacent to
the band for the co-existence requirement in the Table 9.2.2.1-1.
Emission limits for this excluded frequency range may also be covered by
local or regional requirements.

NOTE 2: The Table 9.2.2.1-1 assumes that two operating bands, where the
frequency ranges in Table 5.5-1 would be overlapping, are not deployed
in the same geographical area. For such a case of operation with
overlapping frequency arrangements in the same geographical area,
special co-existence requirements may apply that are not covered by the
3GPP specifications.

NOTE 3: The requirements of -53dBm/100kHz in Table 9.2.2.1-1 for the up
link direction of the Repeater reflect what can be achieved with present
state of the art technology and are based on a coupling loss of 73 dB
between a Repeater and a UTRA TDD BS receiver.

NOTE 4: The requirements of -53dBm/100kHz in Table 9.2.2.1-1 shall be
reconsidered when the state of the art technology progresses.

The following requirement may be applied for the protection of PHS in
geographic areas in which both PHS and E-UTRA-FDD repeaters are
deployed. This requirement is also applicable at specified frequencies
falling between 10 MHz below the lowest frequency of the repeaters
operating band and 10 MHz above the highest frequency of the repeaters
operating band.

Unless otherwise stated this requirement applies to the uplink and
downlink of the repeater, at maximum gain.

The power of any spurious emission shall not exceed:

Table 9.2.2.1-2: Spurious emissions limits for E-UTRA-FDD repeater in
geographic coverage area of PHS

  --------------------- --------------- ----------------------- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following requirement shall be applied to E-UTRA-FDD repeaters
operating in Bands 13 and 14 to ensure that appropriate interference
protection is provided to 700 MHz public safety operations. This
requirement is also applicable at specified frequencies falling between
10 MHz below the lowest frequency of the repeaters operating band and 10
MHz above the highest frequency of the repeaters operating band

Unless otherwise stated this requirement applies to the uplink and
downlink of the repeater, at maximum gain.

The power of any spurious emission shall not exceed:

protection of 700 MHz public safety operations

This requirement shall be applied to repeaters operating in Band 26 to
ensure that appropriate interference protection is provided to 800 MHz
public safety operations. This requirement is also applicable at
specified frequencies falling between 12.5 MHz below the first carrier
frequency used and 12.5 MHz above the last carrier frequency used.

The power of any spurious emission shall not exceed:

### 9.2.3 Co-location with base stations

These requirements may be applied for the protection of other BS
receivers when GSM900, DCS1800, PCS1900, GSM850 UTRA FDD, UTRA TDD
and/or E-UTRA BS are co-located with an E-UTRA FDD Repeater.

Unless otherwise stated the requirements assume a 30 dB coupling loss
between transmitter and receiver.

NOTE: For co-location with UTRA, the requirements are based on
co-location with Wide Area UTRA FDD or TDD base stations.

#### 9.2.3.1 Minimum Requirements

Unless otherwise stated this requirement applies to the uplink and
downlink of the repeater, at maximum gain.

The power of any spurious emission shall not exceed the limits of Table
9.2.3.1-1 for an E-UTRA FDD Repeater where requirements for co-location
with a Base Station listed in the first column apply.

+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+

NOTE 1: As defined in the scope for spurious emissions in this clause,
the co-location requirements in Table 9.2.3.1-1 do not apply for the 10
MHz frequency range immediately outside the repeaters operating band
frequency range of an operating band (see Table 5.5-1). This is also the
case when the repeaters operating band frequency range is adjacent to
the frequency range of the co-location requirement in the
Table 9.2.3.1-1. The current state-of-the-art technology does not allow
a single generic solution for co-location with other system on adjacent
frequencies for 30dB Repeater-BS minimum coupling loss. However, there
are certain site-engineering solutions that can be used. These
techniques are addressed in TR 25.942 \[5\].

NOTE 2: The Table 9.2.3.1-1 assumes that two operating bands, where the
corresponding eNode B transmit and receive frequency ranges in
Table 5.5-1 would be overlapping, are not deployed in the same
geographical area. For such a case of operation with overlapping
frequency arrangements in the same geographical area, special
co-location requirements may apply that are not covered by the 3GPP
specifications.

NOTE 3: The requirements of -53dBm/100kHz in Table 9.2.3.1-1 for the up
link direction of the Repeater reflect what can be achieved with present
state of the art technology and are based on a coupling loss of 73 dB
between a Repeater and a UTRA TDD BS receiver.

NOTE 4: The requirements of -83dBm/100kHz in Table 9.2.3.1-1 for the up
link direction of the Repeater reflect what can be achieved with present
state of the art technology and are based on a coupling loss of 43 dB
between a Repeater and a UTRA TDD BS receiver.

NOTE 5: The requirements of -53dBm/100kHz and -83dBm/100kHz in Table
9.2.3.1-1shall be reconsidered when the state of the art technology
progresses.

10 Error Vector Magnitude
=========================

10.1 Downlink Error Vector Magnitude
------------------------------------

The Error Vector Magnitude is a measure of the difference between the
ideal symbols and the measured symbols after the equalization. This
difference is called the error vector. The equaliser parameters are
estimated as defined in TS36.104 \[6\] Annex E. The EVM result is
defined as the square root of the ratio of the mean error vector power
to the mean reference power expressed in percent.

### 10.1.1 Minimum requirement

For all E-UTRA channel bandwidths, as defined in sub-clause 5.6,
applicable to the repeater, the EVM measurement shall be performed over
all allocated resource blocks and subframes within a frame. The EVM
value is then calculated as the mean square root of the measured values.

For the downlink of the repeater the Error Vector Magnitude shall not be
worse than 8 %.

10.2 Uplink Error Vector Magnitude
----------------------------------

The Error Vector Magnitude is a measure of the difference between the
reference waveform and the measured waveform. This difference is called
the error vector. Before calculating the EVM the measured waveform is
corrected by the sample timing offset and RF frequency offset. Then the
IQ origin offset shall be removed from the measured waveform before
calculating the EVM.

The measured waveform is further modified by selecting the absolute
phase and absolute amplitude of the Tx chain. The EVM result is defined
after the front-end IDFT as the square root of the ratio of the mean
error vector power to the mean reference power expressed as a %. The
basic EVM measurement interval is one slot in the time domain.

### 10.2.1 Minimum requirement

For the uplink of the repeater the RMS average of the basic EVM
measurements for 10 consecutive sub-frames for the different modulations
schemes shall not exceed 8 %.

11 Input Intermodulation
========================

The input intermodulation is a measure of the capability of the repeater
to inhibit the generation of interference in the pass band, in the
presence of interfering signals on frequencies other than the pass band.

11.1 General requirement
------------------------

The following requirement applies for interfering signals in the
operating bands defined in sub-clause 5.5, depending on the repeaters
pass band.

This requirement applies to the uplink and downlink of the repeater, at
maximum gain.

### 11.1.1 Minimum requirement

For the parameters specified in table 11.1.1-1, the power in the pass
band shall not increase with more than 10 dB at the output of the
repeater as measured in the centre of the pass band, compared to the
level obtained without interfering signals applied.

The frequency separation between the two interfering signals shall be
adjusted so that the 3^rd^ order intermodulation product is positioned
in the centre of the pass band.

Table 11.1.1-1 specifies the parameters for two interfering signals,
where:

> \- f~1~ offset is the offset from the channel edge frequency of the
> first or last channel in the pass band of the closer carrier.

Table 11.1.1-1: Input intermodulation requirement

  ------------- --------------------------- ----------------- -----------------------
  f~1~ offset   Interfering Signal Levels   Type of signals   Measurement bandwidth
  1,0 MHz       -40 dBm                     2 CW carriers     1 MHz
  ------------- --------------------------- ----------------- -----------------------

11.2 Co-location with BS in other systems
-----------------------------------------

This additional input intermodulation requirement may be applied for the
protection of E-UTRA FDD Repeater input when GSM900, DCS1800, PCS1900,
GSM850, UTRA FDD, UTRA TDD and/or E-UTRA BS are co-located with an
E-UTRA FDD Repeater.

Unless otherwise stated this requirement applies to the uplink and
downlink of the repeater, at maximum gain.

### 11.2.1 Minimum requirement

For the parameters specified in table 11.2.1-1, the power in the pass
band shall not increase with more than 10 dB at the output of the
repeater as measured in the centre of the pass band, compared to the
level obtained without interfering signals applied.

The frequency separation between the two interfering signals shall be
adjusted so that the lowest order intermodulation product is positioned
in the centre of the pass band.

NOTE 1: The lowest intermodulation products correspond to the 4^th^ and
3^rd^ order for the GSM 900 and DCS 1800 bands, respectively.

signals in co-located other systems

+----------+----------+----------+----------+----------+----------+

NOTE 1: The co-location requirements in Table 11.2.1-1 do not apply when
the repeaters pass band frequency range is adjacent to the frequency
range of the co-location requirement in the Table 11.2.1-1. The current
state-of-the-art technology does not allow a single generic solution for
co-location with other system on adjacent frequencies for 30dB
Repeater-BS minimum coupling loss. However, there are certain
site-engineering solutions that can be used. These techniques are
addressed in TR 25.942 \[5\].

NOTE 2: The Table 11.2.1-1 assumes that two operating bands, where the
corresponding eNode B transmit and receive frequency ranges in
Table 5.5-1 would be overlapping, are not deployed in the same
geographical area. For such a case of operation with overlapping
frequency arrangements in the same geographical area, special
co-location requirements may apply that are not covered by the 3GPP
specifications.

11.3 Co-existence with other systems 
------------------------------------

This additional input intermodulation requirement may be applied when
GSM900, DCS1800, PCS1900, GSM850, UTRA FDD, UTRA TDD and/or E-UTRA BS
operating in another frequency band co-exist with an E-UTRA FDD
Repeater.

Unless otherwise stated this requirement applies to the uplink and
downlink of the repeater, at maximum gain.

### 11.3.1 Minimum requirement

For the parameters specified in table 11.3.1-1, the power in the pass
band shall not increase with more than 10 dB at the output of the
repeater as measured in the centre of the pass band, compared to the
level obtained without interfering signals applied.

The frequency separation between the two interfering signals shall be
adjusted so that the lowest order intermodulation product is positioned
in the centre of the pass band.

NOTE 1: The lowest intermodulation products correspond to the 4^th^ and
3^rd^ order for the GSM 900 and DCS 1800 bands, respectively.

signals in co-existing other systems

NOTE 1: The co-existence requirements in Table 11.3.1-1 do not apply
when the repeaters pass band frequency range is adjacent to the
frequency range of the co-existence requirement in the Table 11.3.1-1.
The current state-of-the-art technology does not allow a single generic
solution for co-existence.

NOTE 2: The Table 11.3.1-1 assumes that two operating bands, where the
frequency ranges in Table 5.5-1 would be overlapping, are not deployed
in the same geographical area. For such a case of operation with
overlapping frequency arrangements in the same geographical area,
special co-existence requirements may apply that are not covered by the
3GPP specifications.

12 Output intermodulation
=========================

The output intermodulation requirement is a measure of the ability of
the repeater to inhibit the generation of intermodulation products
signals created by the presence of an interfering signal reaching the
repeater via the output port.

The requirement shall apply to the downlink of the Repeater.

12.1 Minimum requirement
------------------------

The output intermodulation level is the power of the intermodulation
products when an interfering signal is injected into the output port.
The wanted signal channel bandwidth BW~Channel~ shall be the maximum
bandwidth supported by the repeater. The offset of the interfering
signal from the wanted signal shall be as in Table 12.1‑1.

intermodulation requirement

+----------------------------------+----------------------------------+

The output intermodulation level shall not exceed the unwanted emission
limits in clause 9 in the presence of an interfering signal according to
Table 12.1‑1. The measurement may be limited to frequencies on which
third and fifth order intermodulation products appear, considering the
width of these products.

13 Adjacent Channel Rejection Ratio (ACRR)
==========================================

13.1 Definitions and applicability
----------------------------------

Adjacent Channel Rejection Ratio (ACRR) is the ratio of the RRC weighted
gain per carrier of the repeater in the pass band to the RRC weighted
gain of the repeater on an adjacent channel outside the repeater pass
band. The carrier in the pass band and in the adjacent channel shall be
of the same type (reference carrier).

The requirement shall apply to the uplink and downlink of the Repeater,
at maximum gain, where the donor link is maintained via antennas (over
the air Repeater).

### 13.1.1 Minimum Requirements

There is no minimum requirement for E-UTRA signals.

13.2 Co-existence with UTRA
---------------------------

This requirement shall be applied for the protection of UTRA signals in
geographic areas in which E-UTRA-FDD Repeater and UTRA BS are deployed
so that they serve adjacent channels. The reference carrier is a
UTRA-FDD carrier.

### 13.2.1. Minimum Requirements

In normal conditions the ACRR shall be higher than the value specified
in the Table 13.2.1-1.

Note1: Repeater maximum output power as defined in TS25.143 clause
9.1.1.

Note2: For co-existence with TDD, a narrow band requirement is for
further study.

######## Annex A (normative): Environmental requirements for the Repeater equipment
