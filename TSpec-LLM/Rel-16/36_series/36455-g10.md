3 Definitions, symbols and abbreviations
========================================

3.1 Definitions
---------------

For the purposes of the present document, the terms and definitions
given in TR 21.905 \[1\] and the following apply. A term defined in the
present document takes precedence over the definition of the same term,
if any, in TR 21.905 \[1\].

**Elementary Procedure:** LPPa protocol consists of Elementary
Procedures (EPs). An LPPa Elementary Procedure is a unit of interaction
between the eNB and the E-SMLC. An EP consists of an initiating message
and possibly a response message. Two kinds of EPs are used:

**- Class 1:** Elementary Procedures with response (success or failure),

**- Class 2:** Elementary Procedures without response.

**Cell Portion:** A geographical part of a cell. A cell portion is
semi-static, and identical for both the UL and the DL. Within a cell, a
cell portion is uniquely identified by its Cell Portion ID.

**Transmission Point (TP):** A **set of geographically co-located
transmit antennas for one cell, part of one cell or one PRS-only TP.**
Transmission Points can include base station (eNB) antennas, remote
radio heads, a remote antenna of a base station, an antenna of a
PRS-only TP, etc. One cell can be formed by one or multiple transmission
points. For a homogeneous deployment, each transmission point may
correspond to one cell.

**PRS-only TP**: A TP which only transmits PRS signals for PRS-based TBS
positioning and is not associated with a cell.

4 General
=========

4.1 Procedure specification principles
--------------------------------------

The principle for specifying the procedure logic is to specify the
functional behaviour of the terminating eNB exactly and completely. Any
rule that specifies the behaviour of the originating eNB shall be
possible to be verified with information that is visible within the
system.

The following specification principles have been applied for the
procedure text in clause 8:

\- The procedure text discriminates between:

1\) Functionality which \"shall\" be executed

The procedure text indicates that the receiving node \"shall\" perform a
certain function Y under a certain condition. If the receiving node
supports procedure X but cannot perform functionality Y requested in the
initiating message of a Class 1 EP, the receiving node shall respond
with the message used to report unsuccessful outcome for this procedure,
containing an appropriate cause value.

2\) Functionality which \"shall, if supported\" be executed

The procedure text indicates that the receiving node \"shall, if
supported,\" perform a certain function Y under a certain condition. If
the receiving node supports procedure X, but does not support
functionality Y, the receiving node shall proceed with the execution of
the EP, possibly informing the requesting node about the not supported
functionality.

\- Any required inclusion of an optional IE in a response message is
explicitly indicated in the procedure text. If the procedure text does
not explicitly indicate that an optional IE shall be included in a
response message, the optional IE shall not be included. For
requirements on including *Criticality Diagnostics* IE, see section 10.

4.2 Forwards and backwards compatibility
----------------------------------------

The forwards and backwards compatibility of the protocol is assured by a
mechanism where all current and future messages, and IEs or groups of
related IEs, include ID and criticality fields that are coded in a
standard format that will not be changed in the future. These parts can
always be decoded regardless of the standard version.

4.3 Specification notations
---------------------------

For the purposes of the present document, the following notations apply:

Procedure When referring to an elementary procedure in the specification
the Procedure Name is written with the first letters in each word in
upper case characters followed by the word \"procedure\", e.g. Handover
Preparation procedure.

Message When referring to a message in the specification the MESSAGE
NAME is written with all letters in upper case characters followed by
the word \"message\", e.g. ERROR INDICATION message.

IE When referring to an information element (IE) in the specification
the *Information Element Name* is written with the first letters in each
word in upper case characters and all letters in Italic font followed by
the abbreviation \"IE\", e.g. *Cause* IE.

Value of an IE When referring to the value of an information element
(IE) in the specification the \"Value\" is written as it is specified in
sub clause 9.2 enclosed by quotation marks, e.g. \"Value\".

5 LPPa services
===============

The present clause describes the services an eNB offers to the E-SMLC.

5.1 LPPa procedure modules
--------------------------

The procedures are divided into two modules as follows:

1\. LPPa Location Information Transfer Procedures;

2\. LPPa Management Procedures;

The LPPa Location Information Transfer Procedures module contains
procedures used to handle the transfer of positioning related
information between eNB and E-SMLC.

The Management Procedures module contains procedures that are not
related specifically to positioning, i.e. error handling.

5.2 Parallel transactions
-------------------------

Unless explicitly indicated in the procedure specification, at any
instance in time one protocol peer may have more than one ongoing LPPa
procedure.

6 Services expected from lower layer
====================================

Within E-UTRAN, LPPa protocol uses the services provided by the S1AP
protocol. An LPPa message is carried inside an S1AP message.

S1AP signalling is described in TS 36.413 \[3\].

7 Functions of LPPa
===================

The LPPa protocol provides the following functions:

\- E-CID Location Information Transfer. This function allows the eNB to
exchange location information with the E-SMLC for the purpose of E-CID
positioning.

\- OTDOA Information Transfer. This function allows the eNB to exchange
information with the E-SMLC for the purpose of OTDOA positioning.

\- UTDOA Information Transfer. This function allows the eNB to exchange
information with the E-SMLC for the purpose of supporting UTDOA.

\- Assistance Information Transfer. This function allows the E-SMLC to
exchange information with the eNB for the purpose of assistance
information broadcasting.

\- Reporting of General Error Situations. This function allows reporting
of general error situations, for which function specific error messages
have not been defined.

The mapping between the above functions and LPPa EPs is shown in the
table below.

8.2 Location Information Transfer Procedures
--------------------------------------------

### 8.2.1 E-CID Measurement Initiation

#### 8.2.1.1 General

The purpose of E-CID Measurement Initiation procedure is to allow the
E-SMLC to request the eNB to report E-CID measurements used by E-SMLC to
compute the location of the UE.

#### 8.2.1.2 Successful Operation

Figure 8.2.1.2-1: E-CID Measurement Initiation procedure, successful
operation

The E-SMLC initiates the procedure by sending an E-CID MEASUREMENT
INITIATION REQUEST message. If the eNB is able to initiate the requested
E-CID measurements, it shall reply with the E-CID MEASUREMENT INITIATION
RESPONSE message.

The *Measured Results* IE shall be included in the *E-CID Measurement
Result* IE of the E-CID MEASUREMENT INITIATION RESPONSE message when
measurement results other than the \"Cell-ID\" have been requested.

If the *Report Characteristics* IE is set to \"OnDemand\", the eNB shall
return the result of the measurement in the E-CID MEASUREMENT INITIATION
RESPONSE message including, if available, the *E-UTRAN Access Point
Position* IE in the *E-CID Measurement Result* IE, and the E-SMLC shall
consider that the E-CID measurements for the UE has been terminated by
the eNB. If available, the eNB shall include the *Cell Portion ID* IE in
the E-CID MEASUREMENT INITIATION RESPONSE message. Upon reception of the
*Cell Portion ID* IE, the E-SMLC may use the value as the cell portion

9.2 Information Element definitions
-----------------------------------

### 9.2.0 General

When specifying information elements which are to be represented by bit
strings, if not otherwise specifically stated in the semantics
description of the concerned IE or elsewhere, the following principle
applies with regards to the ordering of bits:

\- The first bit (leftmost bit) contains the most significant bit (MSB);

\- The last bit (rightmost bit) contains the least significant bit
(LSB);

\- When importing bit strings from other specifications, the first bit
of the bit string contains the first bit of the concerned information.

### 9.2.1 Cause

The purpose of the cause information element is to indicate the reason
for a particular event for the whole protocol.

9.3 Message and Information Element Abstract Syntax (with ASN.1)
----------------------------------------------------------------

### 9.3.1 General

Sub clause 9.3 presents the Abstract Syntax of the LPPa protocol with
ASN.1. In case there is contradiction between the ASN.1 definition in
this sub clause and the tabular format in sub clause 9.1 and 9.2, the
ASN.1 shall take precedence, except for the definition of conditions for
the presence of conditional elements, in which the tabular format shall
take precedence.

The ASN.1 definition specifies the structure and content of LPPa
messages. LPPa messages can contain any IEs specified in the object set
definitions for that message without the order or number of occurrence
being restricted by ASN.1. However, for this version of the standard, a
sending entity shall construct an LPPa message according to the PDU
definitions module and with the following additional rules (Note that in
the following, \"IE\" means an IE in the object set with an explicit id.
If one IE needs to appear more than once in one object set, then the
different occurrences have different IE ids):

\- IEs shall be ordered (in an IE container) in the order they appear in
object set definitions.

\- Object set definitions specify how many times IEs may appear. An IE
shall appear exactly once if the presence field in an object has value
\"mandatory\". An IE may appear at most once if the presence field in an
object has value \"optional\" or \"conditional\". If in a tabular format
there is multiplicity specified for an IE (i.e. an IE list) then in the
corresponding ASN.1 definition the list definition is separated into two
parts. The first part defines an IE container list in which the list
elements reside. The second part defines list elements. The IE container
list appears as an IE of its own. For this version of the standard an IE
container list may contain only one kind of list elements.

If an LPPa message that is not constructed as defined above is received,
this shall be considered as Abstract Syntax Error, and the message shall
be handled as defined for Abstract Syntax Error in clause 10.

### 9.3.2 Usage of Private Message Mechanism for Non-standard Use

The private message mechanism for non-standard use may be used:

\- for special operator (and/or vendor) specific features considered not
to be part of the basic functionality, i.e. the functionality required
for a complete and high-quality specification in order to guarantee
multivendor inter-operability.

\- by vendors for research purposes, e.g. to implement and evaluate new
algorithms/features before such features are proposed for
standardisation.

The private message mechanism shall not be used for basic functionality.
Such functionality shall be standardised.
