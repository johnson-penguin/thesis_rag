4 Introduction
==============

At the TSG RAN \#39 meeting, the Study Item description on \"Further
Advancements for E-UTRA (LTE-Advanced)\" was approved \[1\]. The study
item covers technology components to be considered for the evolution of
E-UTRA, e.g. to fulfil the requirements on IMT-Advanced. This technical
report covers all RAN aspects of these technology components.

5 Support of wider bandwidth
============================

5.1 General
-----------

LTE-Advanced extends LTE Rel.-8 with support for C*arrier Aggregation*,
where two or more *component carriers* (CCs) are aggregated in order to
support wider transmission bandwidths up to 100MHz and for spectrum
aggregation.

It shall be possible to configure all component carriers which are LTE
Rel-8 compatible, at least when the aggregated numbers of component
carriers in the UL and the DL are the same. Not all component carriers
may necessarily be LTE Rel-8 compatible.

A terminal may simultaneously receive or transmit one or multiple
component carriers depending on its capabilities:

\- An LTE-Advanced terminal with reception and/or transmission
capabilities for carrier aggregation can simultaneously receive and/or
transmit on multiple component carriers.

\- An LTE Rel-8 terminal can receive and transmit on a single component
carrier only, provided that the structure of the component carrier
follows the Rel-8 specifications.

Carrier aggregation is supported for both contiguous and non-contiguous
component carriers with each component carrier limited to a maximum of
110 Resource Blocks in the frequency domain using the LTE Rel-8
numerology

It is possible to configure a UE to aggregate a different number of
component carriers originating from the same eNB and of possibly
different bandwidths in the UL and the DL. In typical TDD deployments,
the number of component carriers and the bandwidth of each component
carrier in UL and DL will be the same.

Component carriers originating from the same eNB need not to provide the
same coverage.

The spacing between centre frequencies of contiguously aggregated
component carriers shall be a multiple of 300 kHz. This is in order to
be compatible with the 100 kHz frequency raster of LTE Rel-8 and at the
same time preserve orthogonality of the subcarriers with 15 kHz spacing.
Depending on the aggregation scenario, the n\*300 kHz spacing can be
facilitated by insertion of a low number of unused subcarriers between
contiguous component carriers.

5.1A Physical layer
-------------------

### 5.1A.1 DL control signalling

The design principles for downlink control signalling of control region
size, uplink and downlink resource assignments, and downlink HARQ
ACK/NACK indication are described below.

\- Independent control region size is applied for each component
carrier. On any carrier with a control region, Rel-8 design (modulation,
coding, mapping to resource elements) for PCFICH is reused.

\- For signalling of resource assignments for downlink (PDSCH) and
uplink (PUSCH) transmission, following mechanisms are supported,

> \- PDCCH on a component carrier assigns PDSCH resources on the same
> component carrier and PUSCH resources on a single linked UL component
> carrier. Rel-8 PDCCH structure (same coding, same CCE-based resource
> mapping) and DCI formats are used on each component carrier.
>
> \- PDCCH on a component carrier can assign PDSCH or PUSCH resources in
> one of multiple component carriers using the carrier indicator field,
> where Rel-8 DCI formats are extended with 1 -- 3 bit carrier indicator
> field, and Rel-8 PDCCH structure (same coding, same CCE-based resource
> mapping) is reused.

where the presence of carrier indicator field is semi-statically
configured.

\- For signalling of downlink HARQ ACK/NACK indication, following
principles are applied.

> \- PHICH physical transmission aspects from Rel-8 (orthogonal code
> design, modulation, scrambling sequence, mapping to resource elements)
> are reused.
>
> \- PHICH is transmitted only on the downlink component carrier that
> was used to transmit the UL grant
>
> \- At least in case that the number of downlink component carriers are
> more than or equal to that of uplink component carriers and no carrier
> indicator field is used, the Rel-8 PHICH resource mapping rule is
> reused.

### 5.1A.2 UL control signalling

The design principles for uplink control signalling of HARQ ACK/NACK,
scheduling request and channel state information (CSI) on PUCCH are
described below.

\- The Rel-10 PUCCH design supports up to five DL component carriers.

\- For signalling of HARQ ACK/NACK on PUCCH for downlink (PDSCH)
transmission, following mechanisms are supported:

\- All HARQ ACK/NACK for a UE can be transmitted on PUCCH in absence of
PUSCH transmission.

\- In general, transmission of one ACK/NACK for each DL component
carrier transport block is supported.

\- In case of power limitation, limited transmission of ACK/NACK for the
DL component carrier transport blocks is supported.

\- The design of the ACK/NACK resource allocation should consider
performance and power control aspects, while not aiming to optimise for
the case of large number of UEs being simultaneously scheduled on
multiple DL component carriers.

\- The scheduling request is transmitted on PUCCH and is semi-statically
mapped onto one UE specific UL component carrier.

\- Periodic CSI reporting on PUCCH is supported for up to five DL
component carriers. The CSI is semi-statically mapped onto one UE
specific UL component carrier and the design follows the Rel-8
principles for CQI/PMI/RI, considering ways to reduce reporting overhead
or to extend CSI payload.

5.2 User Plane
--------------

### 5.2.1 Structure

Compared to the Layer 2 structure of LTE Rel-8, the multi-carrier nature
of the physical layer is only exposed to the MAC layer for which one
HARQ entity is required per CC. The Layer 2 structure for the downlink
is depicted on Figured 5.2.1-1 below.

Figure 5.2.1-1: Layer 2 Structure for the DL

The Layer 2 structure for the uplink is depicted on Figured 5.2.1-2
below.

Figure 5.2.1-2: Layer 2 Structure for the UL

### 5.2.2 MAC

From a UE perspective, the Layer 2 aspects of HARQ are kept Rel-8
compliant unless modifications provide significant gains. There is one
transport block (in absence of spatial multiplexing, up to two transport
blocks in case of spatial multiplexing) and one independent hybrid-ARQ
entity per scheduled component carrier. Each transport block is mapped
to a single component carrier only where all possible HARQ
retransmissions also take place. A UE may be scheduled over multiple
component carriers simultaneously but at most one random access
procedure shall be ongoing at any time.

Whenever a UE is configured with only one CC, Rel-9 DRX is the baseline.
In other cases, the baseline is that the same DRX operation applies to
all configured CCs (i.e. identical active time for PDCCH monitoring).
When in active time, any CC may always schedule PDSCH on any other
configured (and possibly activated, FFS) CC.

### 5.2.3 RLC

The RLC protocol of LTE Rel-8 also applies to carrier aggregation and
allows LTE-A to handle data rate up to 1Gbps. Further enhancements (e.g.
increased RLC SN size) can be considered.

### 5.2.4 PDCP

The PDCP protocol of LTE Rel-8 also applies to carrier aggregation.
Further enhancements (e.g. increased PDCP SN size) can be considered.

5.3 Control plane
-----------------

### 5.3.1 Structure

The C-Plane architecture of LTE Rel-8 also applies to carrier
aggregation.

### 5.3.2 RRC procedures

#### 5.3.2.1 System Information

A cell is identified by a unique ECGI and corresponds to the
transmission of system information in one CC. Rel-8 relevant system
information and possible extensions for LTE-A are delivered on
\"*backward compatible*\" CCs. Each CC provides on BCCH the system
information which is specific to it. The handling of system information
for extension carriers is FFS.

#### 5.3.2.2 Connection Control

As in LTE Rel-8, the UE only has one RRC connection with the network.
One cell - the \"special cell\" - provides the security input (one ECGI,
one PCI and one ARFCN) and the NAS mobility information (e.g. TAI).
There is only one \"special cell\" per UE in connected mode.

After RRC connection establishment to the \"special cell\", the
reconfiguration, addition and removal of CCs can be performed by
*RRCConnectionReconfiguration* including *mobilityControlInfo* (i.e.
\"intra-cell handover\"). *RRCConnectionReconfiguration* without
*mobilityControlInfo* can also be used for the addition of CCs, and for
the removal of CCs with the exception of the CC corresponding to the
\"special cell\".

At intra-LTE handover, the *RRCConnectionReconfiguration* with
*mobilityControlInfo* (i.e. \"handover command\") can remove,
reconfigure or add CCs for usage in the target cell.

When adding a new CC, dedicated RRC signalling is used for sending CCs\'
system information which is necessary for CC transmission/reception
(similarly as in Rel-8 for handover).

Detection of failure of one CC by the UE does not necessarily trigger a
connection re-establishment. RRC connection re-establishment triggers at
the UE include:

1\) The failure of all CCs on which the UE is configured to receive
PDCCH;

NOTE: FFS if re-establishment is triggered under more restrictive
conditions (e.g. in case of problems on a smaller subset of CC\'s).

2\) The loss of all UL communication;

NOTE: The conditions under which all UL communications are said to be
lost are FFS.

3\) The indication from RLC that the maximum number of retransmissions
has been reached (as in Rel-8).

#### 5.3.2.3 Measurements

UE sees a CC as any other carrier frequency and a measurement object
needs to be set up for a CC in order for the UE to measure it.
Inter-frequency neighbour measurements (for which no serving cell is
defined for measurement purposes) encompass all the carrier frequencies
which are not configured as CCs.

### 5.3.3 Idle mode procedures

Idle mode mobility procedures of LTE Rel-8 also apply in a network
deploying carrier aggregation. It should be possible for a network to
configure only a subset of CCs for idle mode camping.

6 Uplink transmission scheme
============================

***6.1 Uplink spatial multiplexing***
-------------------------------------

LTE-Advanced extends LTE Rel-8 with support for uplink spatial
multiplexing of up to four layers.

In case of uplink single-user spatial multiplexing, up to two transport
blocks can be transmitted from a scheduled UE in a subframe per uplink
component carrier. Each transport block has its own MCS level. Depending
on the number of transmission layers, the modulation symbols associated
with each of the transport blocks are mapped onto one or two layers
according to the same principle as for LTE Rel-8 downlink spatial
multiplexing. The transmission rank can be adapted dynamically. It is
possible to configure the uplink single-user spatial-multiplexing
transmission with or without the layer shifting. In case of the layer
shifting, shifting in time domain is supported.

If layer shifting is configured, the HARQ-ACKs for all transport blocks
are bundled into a single HARQ-ACK. One-bit ACK is transmitted to the UE
if all transport blocks are successfully decoded by the eNodeB.
Otherwise, one-bit NACK is transmitted to the UE.

If layer shifting is not configured, each transport block has its own
HARQ-ACK feedback signalling.

For FDD and TDD, precoding is performed according to a predefined
codebook. If layer shifting is not configured, precoding is applied
after the layer mapping. If layer shifting is configured, precoding is
applied after the layer shifting operation. Application of a single
precoding matrix per uplink component carrier is supported. In case of
full-rank transmission, only identity precoding matrix is supported. For
uplink spatial multiplexing with two transmit antennas, 3-bit precoding
codebook as defined in Table 6.1-1 is used.

For uplink spatial multiplexing with four transmit antennas, 6-bit
precoding codebook is used. The subset of the precoding codebook used
for 1-layer transmission is defined in Table 6.1-2. The baseline for the
subset of the precoding codebook used for 2-layer transmission is
defined in Table 6.1-3. For 3-layer transmission, the number of
precoding matrices is 20, and only BPSK or QPSK alphabets are used for
non-zero elements in precoding matrices.

6.1A Uplink transmit diversity
------------------------------

For UEs with multiple transmit antennas, an uplink Single Antenna Port
Mode is defined, where the UE behaviour is same as the one with single
antenna from eNodeB\'s perspective. For a given UE, the uplink Single
Antenna Port Mode can be independently configured for its PUCCH, PUSCH
and SRS transmissions.

The uplink Single Antenna Port Mode is the default mode before eNodeB is
aware of the UE transmit antenna configuration.

### 6.1A.1 Transmit Diversity for Uplink Control Channel

For uplink control channels with Rel-8 PUCCH format 1/1a/1b, the spatial
orthogonal-resource transmit diversity (SORTD) scheme is supported for
transmissions with two antenna ports. In this transmit diversity scheme,
the same modulation symbol from the uplink channel is transmitted from
two antenna ports, on two separate orthogonal resources.

For the UE with four transmit antennas, the 2-tx transmit diversity
scheme is applied.

6.2 Uplink multiple access
--------------------------

DFT-precoded OFDM is the transmission scheme used for PUSCH both in
absence and presence of spatial multiplexing. In case of multiple
component carriers, there is one DFT per component carrier. Both
frequency-contiguous and frequency-non-contiguous resource allocation is
supported on each component carrier.

Simultaneous transmission of uplink L1/L2 control signalling and data is
supported through two mechanisms

\- Control signalling is multiplexed with data on PUSCH according to the
same principle as in LTE Rel-8

\- Control signalling is transmitted on PUCCH simultaneously with data
on PUSCH

6.3 Uplink reference signals
----------------------------

LTE Advanced retains the basic uplink reference-signal structure of LTE
Rel-8, with two types of uplink reference signals:

\- Demodulation reference signal

\- Sounding reference signal

In case of uplink multi-antenna transmission, the precoding applied for
the demodulation reference signal is the same as the one applied for the
PUSCH. Cyclic shift separation is the primary multiplexing scheme of the
demodulation reference signals.

The baseline for sounding reference signal in LTE-Advanced operation is
non-precoded and antenna-specific. For multiplexing of the sounding
reference signals, the LTE Rel-8 principles are reused.

***6.4 Uplink power control***
------------------------------

Scope of uplink power control in LTE-Advanced is similar to Rel\'8:

\- UL power control mainly compensates for slow-varying channel
conditions while reducing the interference generated towards neighboring
cells

\- Fractional path-loss compensation or full path-loss compensation is
used on PUSCH and full path-loss compensation on PUCCH

LTE-Advanced supports component carrier specific UL power control for
both contiguous and non-contiguous carrier aggregation for closed-loop
case, and for open loop at least for the cases that the number of
downlink component carriers is more than or equal to that of uplink
component carriers.

7 Downlink transmission scheme
==============================

7.0 Physical channel mapping
----------------------------

LTE-Advanced supports the PDSCH to be mapped also to MBSFN (non-control)
region of MBSFN subframes that are not used for MBMS

\- In case of PDSCH mapping to MBSFN subframes, both normal and extended
cyclic prefix can be used for control and data region, same CP length is
used for control and data

\- Relation between CP length of normal and MBSFN subframes in the
control region is the same as in Rel-8

***7.1 Downlink spatial multiplexing***
---------------------------------------

LTE-Advanced extends LTE Rel-8 downlink spatial multiplexing with
support for up to eight layers spatial multiplexing

In the downlink 8-by-X single user spatial multiplexing, up to two
transport blocks can be transmitted to a scheduled UE in a subframe per
downlink component carrier. Each transport block is assigned its own
modulation and coding scheme. For HARQ ACK/NAK feedback on uplink, one
bit is used for each transport block.

A transport block is associated with a codeword. For up to four layers,
the codeword-to-layer mapping is the same as for LTE Rel-8. For more
than four layers as well as the case of mapping one codeword to three or
four layers, which is for retransmission of one out of two codewords
that were initially transmitted with more than four layers, the layer
mapping shall be done according to Table 7.1-1. Complex-valued
modulation symbols for code word shall be mapped onto the layers, where
is the number of layers and is the number of modulation symbols per
layer.

case of mapping one codeword to three or four layers

+------------------+--------------------+--------------------+---+

### 7.1.1 Feedback in support of downlink spatial multiplexing

The baseline for feedback in support of downlink single-cell single-user
spatial multiplexing is codebook-based precoding feedback.

***7.2 Downlink reference signals***
------------------------------------

LTE-Advanced extends the downlink reference-signal structure of LTE with

\- Reference signals targeting PDSCH demodulation

\- Reference signals targeting CSI estimation (for CQI/PMI/RI/etc
reporting when needed)

The reference signal structure can be used to support multiple
LTE-Advanced features, e.g. CoMP and spatial multiplexing.

The reference signals targeting PDSCH demodulation are:

\- UE-specific, i.e, the PDSCH and the demodulation reference signals
intended for a specific UE are subject to the same precoding operation.

\- Present only in resource blocks and layers scheduled by the eNodeB
for transmission.

\- Mutually orthogonal between layers at the eNodeB.

The design principle for the reference signals targeting PDSCH
modulation is an extension to multiple layers of the concept of Rel-8
UE-specific reference signals used for beamforming. Complementary use of
Rel-8 cell-specific reference signals by the UE is not precluded.

Reference signals targeting CSI estimation are

\- cell specific

\- sparse in frequency and time

\- punctured into the data region of normal/MBSFN subframe.

7.3 Downlink transmit diversity
-------------------------------

For the downlink transmit diversity with more than four transmit
antennas applied to PDCCH, and PDSCH in non-MBSFN subframes, the Rel-8
transmit diversity scheme is used.

8 Coordinated multiple point transmission and reception
=======================================================

Coordinated multi-point (CoMP) transmission/reception is considered for
LTE-Advanced as a tool to improve the coverage of high data rates, the
cell-edge throughput and/or to increase system throughput.

***8.1 Downlink coordinated multi-point transmission***
-------------------------------------------------------

Downlink coordinated multi-point transmission (CoMP) is a relatively
general term referring to different types of coordination in the
downlink transmission from multiple geographically separated
transmission points (TP). This includes coordination in the scheduling,
including any beam-forming functionality, between geographically
separated transmission points and joint transmission from geographically
separated transmissions points.

***8.2 Uplink coordinated multi-point reception***
--------------------------------------------------

Uplink CoMP reception is a relatively general term referring to
different types of coordination in the uplink reception at multiple,
geographically separated points. This includes coordination in the
scheduling, including any beam-forming functionality, between
geographically separated reception points.

9 Relaying
==========

9.1 General
-----------

LTE-Advanced extends LTE Rel-8 with support for relaying as a tool to
improve e.g. the coverage of high data rates, group mobility, temporary
network deployment, the cell-edge throughput and/or to provide coverage
in new areas.

The relay node (RN) is wirelessly connected to a *donor cell* of a
*donor eNB* via the Un interface, and UEs connect to the RN via the Uu
interface as shown on Figure 9.1-1 below.

Figure 9.1-1: Relays

With respect to the relay node\'s usage of spectrum, its operation can
be classified into:

*- inband*, in which case the eNB-RN link shares the same carrier
frequency with RN-UE links. Rel-8 UEs should be able to connect to the
donor cell in this case.

*- outband*, in which case the eNB-RN link does not operate in the same
carrier frequency as RN-UE links. Rel-8 UEs should be able to connect to
the donor cell in this case.

For both inband and outband relaying, it shall be possible to operate
the eNB-to-relay link on the same carrier frequency as eNB-to-UE links.

At least \"Type 1\" and \"Type 1a\" RNs are supported by LTE-Advanced.

A \"Type 1\" RN is an inband RN characterized by the following:

\- It controls cells, each of which appears to a UE as a separate cell
distinct from the donor cell

\- The cells shall have their own Physical Cell ID (as defined in LTE
Rel-8) and transmit their own synchronization channels, reference
symbols, ...

\- In the context of single-cell operation, the UE receives scheduling
information and HARQ feedback directly from the RN and sends its control
channels (SR/CQI/ACK) to the RN

\- It shall appear as a Rel-8 eNodeB to Rel-8 UEs (i.e. be backwards
compatible)

\- To LTE-Advanced UEs, it should be possible for a relay node to appear
differently than Rel-8 eNodeB to allow for further performance
enhancement.

A \"Type 1a\" relay node is characterised by the same set of features as
the \"Type 1\" relay node above, except \"Type 1a\" operates outband.

9.2 Architecture
----------------

On Uu interface between UE and RN, all AS control plane (RRC) and user
plane (PDCP, RLC and MAC) protocols are terminated in RN. On Un
interface between RN and eNB, the user plane is based on standardised
protocols (PDCP, RLC, MAC). The control plane on Un uses RRC (for the RN
in its role as UE).

9.3 Relay-eNodeB link for inband relay
--------------------------------------

### 9.3.1 Resource partitioning for relay-eNodeB link

In order to allow inband relaying, some resources in the time-frequency
space are set aside for the backhaul link (Un) and cannot be used for
the access link (Uu). At least the following scheme is supported for
this resource partitioning:

Resource partitioning at the RN:

\- in the downlink, eNB → RN and RN → UE links are time division
multiplexed in a single carrier frequency (only one is active at any
time)

\- in the uplink, UE → RN and RN → eNB links are time division
multiplexed in a single carrier frequency (only one is active at any
time)

Multiplexing of backhaul links in FDD:

\- eNB → RN transmissions are done in the DL frequency band

\- RN → eNB transmissions are done in the UL frequency band

Multiplexing of backhaul links in TDD:

\- eNB → RN transmissions are done in the DL subframes of the eNB and RN

\- RN → eNB transmissions are done in the UL subframes of the eNB and RN

### 9.3.2 Backward compatible backhaul partitioning 

Due to the relay transmitter causing interference to its own receiver,
simultaneous eNodeB-to-relay and relay-to-UE transmissions on the same
frequency resource may not be feasible unless sufficient isolation of
the outgoing and incoming signals is provided. Similarly, at the relay
it may not be possible to receive UE transmissions simultaneously with
the relay transmitting to the eNodeB.

One way to handle the interference problem is to operate the relay such
that the relay is not transmitting to terminals when it is supposed to
receive data from the donor eNodeB, i.e. to create \"gaps\" in the
relay-to-UE transmission. These \"gaps\" during which terminals
(including Rel-8 terminals) are not supposed to expect any relay
transmission can be created by configuring MBSFN subframes as
exemplified in Figure 9.1. Relay-to-eNodeB transmissions can be
facilitated by not allowing any terminal-to-relay transmissions in some
subframes.

Figure 9.1: Example of relay-to-UE communication using normal subframes
(left) and eNodeB-to-relay communication using MBSFN subframes (right).

### 9.3.3 Backhaul resource assignment

In case of downlink backhaul in downlink resources, the following is
valid

\- At the RN, the access link downlink subframe boundary is aligned with
the backhaul link downlink subframe boundary, except for possible
adjustment to allow for RN transmit/receive switching

\- The set of downlink backhaul subframes, during which downlink
backhaul transmission may occur, is semi-statically assigned.

\- The set of uplink backhaul subframes, during which uplink backhaul
transmission may occur, can be semi-statically assigned, or implicitly
derived from the downlink backhaul subframes using the HARQ timing
relationship

\- A new physical control channel (the R-PDCCH) is used to dynamically
or semi-persistently assign resources, within the semi-statically
assigned sub-frames, for the downlink backhaul data (corresponding to
the R-PDSCH physical channel). The R-PDCCH may assign downlink resources
in the same and/or in one or more later subframes.

\- The R-PDCCH is also used to dynamically or semi-persistently assign
resources for the uplink backhaul data (the R-PUSCH physical channel).
The R-PDCCH may assign uplink resources in one or more later subframes.

\- Within the PRBs semi-statically assigned for R-PDCCH transmission, a
subset of the resources is used for each R-PDCCH. The actual overall set
of resources used for R-PDCCH transmission within the above mentioned
semi-statically assigned PRBs may vary dynamically between subframes.
These resources may correspond to the full set of OFDM symbols available
for the backhaul link or be constrained to a subset of these OFDM
symbols. The resources that are not used for R-PDCCH within the above
mentioned semi-statically assigned PRBs may be used to carry R-PDSCH or
PDSCH.

\- The detailed R-PDCCH transmitter processing (channel coding,
interleaving, multiplexing, etc.) should reuse Rel-8 functionality to
the extent possible, but allow removing some unnecessary procedure or
bandwidth-wasting procedure by considering the relay property.

\- If the search space approach of Rel-8 is used for the backhaul link,
use of common search space, which can be semi-statically configured (and
potentially includes entire system bandwidth), is the baseline. If
RN-specific search space is configured, it could be implicitly or
explicitly known by RN.

\- The R-PDCCH is transmitted starting from an OFDM symbol within the
subframe that is late enough so that the relay can receive it.

\- R-PDSCH and R-PDCCH can be transmitted within the same PRBs or within
separated PRBs.

9.4 Relay-eNodeB link for outband relay
---------------------------------------

If relay-eNB and relay-UE links are isolated enough in frequency
(possibly with help of additional means such as antenna separation),
then there is no interference issue in activating both links
simultaneously. Therefore, it becomes possible for relay-eNodeB link to
reuse the channels designed for UE-eNodeB link.

10 Improvement for latency
==========================

***10.1 Improvement for C-Plane latency***
------------------------------------------

In LTE-Advanced, the transition time requirement from Idle mode (with IP
address allocated) to Connected mode is less than 50 ms including the
establishment of the user plane (excluding the S1 transfer delay). The
transition requirement from a \"dormant state\" in Connected mode is
less than 10 ms.

![](media/image8.wmf){width="2.5125in" height="1.6527777777777777in"}

Figure 10.1-1: C-Plane Latency

Although already LTE Rel-8 fulfills the latency requirements of ITU (see
Annex B), several mechanisms could be used to further reduce the latency
and achieve also the more aggressive LTE-Advanced targets set by 3GPP
\[3\]:

\- **Combined RRC Connection Request and NAS Service Request**:
combining allows those two messages to be processed in parallel at the
eNB and MME respectively, reducing overall latency from Idle mode to
Connected mode by approx. 20ms.

\- **Reduced processing delays**: processing delays in the different
nodes form the major part of the delay (around 75% for the transition
from Idle to Connected mode assuming a combined request) so any
improvement has a large impact on the overall latency.

\- **Reduced RACH scheduling period**: decreasing the RACH scheduling
period from 10 ms to 5 ms results in decreasing by 2.5ms the average
waiting time for the UE to initiate the procedure to transit from Idle
mode to Connected mode.

Regarding the transition from a \"dormant state\" in Connected mode, the
following mechanism could be used in LTE-Advanced to achieve the
requirement:

\- **Shorter PUCCH cycle**: a shorter cycle of PUCCH would reduce the
average waiting time for a synchronised UE to request resources in
Connected mode.

\- **Contention based uplink**: contention based uplink allows UEs to
transmit uplink data without having to first transmit Scheduling Request
on PUCCH, thus reducing the access time for synchronized UEs in
Connected mode.

10.2 Improvement for U-Plane latency
------------------------------------

LTE Rel-8 already benefits from a U-Plane latency below 10ms for
synchronised UEs (see Annex B). In situations where the UE does not have
a valid scheduling assignment, or when the UE needs to synchronize and
obtain a scheduling assignment, a reduced RACH scheduling period,
shorter PUCCH cycle, contention based uplink and reduced processing
delays as described in clause 10.1 above could also be used to improve
the latency compared to LTE Rel-8.

11 Radio transmission and reception
===================================

***11.1 RF scenarios***
-----------------------

### 11.1.1 Deployment scenarios

This clause reviews deployment scenarios that were considered for
initial investigation in a near term time frame. Scenarios are shown in
Table 11.1.1-1.

Table 11.1.1-1: Deployment scenarios

  ---------- --------------------------------------------------------------------
  Scenario   Proposed initial deployment scenario for investigation
  a          Single band contiguous allocation for FDD (UL:40 MHz, DL: 80 MHz)
  b          Single band contiguous allocation for TDD (100 MHz)
  c          Multi band non-contiguous allocation for FDD (UL:40MHz, DL:40 MHz)
  d          Multi band non contiguous allocation for TDD (90 MHz)
  ---------- --------------------------------------------------------------------

***11.2 Common requirements for UE and BS***
--------------------------------------------

### 11.2.1 Carrier Aggregation

#### 11.2.1.1 Bandwidth configuration of component carriers

Radio requirements shall be specified for aggregation of component
carriers for both contiguous and non-contiguous aggregation. The allowed
channel bandwidths for each component carrier are 1.4 MHz, 3.0 MHz,
5MHz, 10 MHz, 15 MHz and 20 MHz.

#### 11.2.1.2 Carrier spacing between component carriers

The carrier spacing between component carriers is a multiple of 300 kHz
for contiguous aggregation and non-contiguous aggregation in the same
operating band. It shall be possible to configure all component carriers
LTE Release 8 compatible, at least when the aggregated numbers of
component carriers in the UL and the DL are same. Not all component
carriers may necessarily be LTE release 8 compatible.

### 11.2.2 Operating bands

Operating bands of LTE-Advanced will involve E-UTRA operating bands as
well as possible IMT bands identified by ITU-R. E-UTRA is designed to
operate in the operating bands as defined in \[5, 6\]. E-UTRA operating
bands are shown in Table 11.2.2-1.

Table 11.2.2-1 Operating bands for LTE-Advanced (E-UTRA operating
bands):

***11.3 UE RF requirements*** 
-----------------------------

### 11.3.1 General

LTE-Advanced extends LTE release 8 with support for C*arrier
Aggregation*, where two or more *component carriers* (CC) are aggregated
in order to support wider transmission bandwidths up to 100MHz and for
spectrum aggregation. A terminal may simultaneously receive one or
multiple component carriers depending on its capabilities

It will be possible to aggregate a different number of component
carriers of possibly different bandwidths in the UL and the DL. In
typical TDD deployments, the number of component carriers and the
bandwidth of each component carrier in UL and DL will be the same. Both
Intra and Inter band carrier aggregation are considered as potential Tx
RF scenarios and parameters and cover both of; Contiguous Component
Carrier and non-contiguous Component Carrier aggregation

RAN4, RF requirements are specified in terms of a Minimum Requirements

### 11.3.2 Transmitter characteristics

RAN4 Tx characteristic would need to support 3 generic aggregation
scenarios depending on UE capability;

\- Intra band contiguous **component** carrier (CC) aggregation

\- Intra band non - contiguous **component** carrier (CC) aggregation

\- Inter band non-contiguous **component** carrier (CC) aggregation

#### 11.3.2.1 Transmitter architecture 

Figure 11.3.2.1-1 illustrates various TX architectures options according
to where the component carriers are combined, i.e., at digital baseband,
or in analog waveforms before RF mixer, or after mixer but before the
PA, or after the PA.

Option A

\- In an adjacent *contiguous common carrier* aggregation scenario, the
UE very likely has one PA. Connected to the PA can be a single RF chain
(a zero-IF mixer, a wideband DAC, and a wideband IFFT)

Option-B

\- Combines analog baseband waveforms from component Carrier first
(e.g., via a mixer operating at an IF of roughly the bandwidth of the
other component carrier in the example of 2-component carrier
aggregation). Then the resulting wideband signal is up-converted to RF.

Option-C

\- Does ZIF up-conversion of each component carrier before combining and
feeding into a single PA.

Option-D

\- Employs multiple RF chains and multiple PAs after which the
high-power signals are combined and fed into a single antenna. PA
coupling at the UE can be challenging for option-D.

Figure 11.3.2.1-1: Possible UE Architectures in three aggregation
scenarios

#### 11.3.2.2 Transmit power

In order to support backward related to UE maximum output power it is
expect that LTE-Advanced UE power class should be a subset of the
current EUTRA and UTRA Release 8 power classes. In the case of dual Tx
antenna (separate or dual PA) or CPE / Relay products the conducted
transmit power may need to be augmented to support these new features.

#### 11.3.2.3 Output power dynamics

In REL-8 power control is defined on sub-frame basis for a single
component carrier. For LTE-Advanced, the architecture of single or
multiple PA can have an impact on the power control dynamics. In the
case where the PA supports a component carrier, the CM is not a concern
since each component carrier will have a fixed maximum transmit power.
But a single PA architecture can potentially impact the power control
procedure when its power is shared amongst component carriers

For LTE-Advanced power control would need to consider the following
scenarios in the case of; OFF power, minimum power and power tolerance;
In this case the transmitter characteristic for output power dynamics
could be defined;

\- Intra band contiguous **component** carrier (CC) aggregation

\- Intra band non - contiguous **component** carrier (CC) aggregation

\- Inter band non-contiguous **component** carrier (CC) aggregation

\- Single or multiple segment power control

#### 11.3.2.4 Transmit signal quality

In REL-8 EVM performance is defined on sub-frame basis for a single
component carrier.

For LTE-Advanced EVM would need to consider the following scenarios;

\- Intra band contiguous **component** carrier (CC) aggregation

\- Intra band non - contiguous **component** carrier (CC) aggregation

\- Inter band non-contiguous **component** carrier (CC) aggregation

#### 11.3.2.5 Output RF spectrum emissions

Spurious emissions are emissions which are caused by unwanted
transmitter effects such as harmonics emission, parasitic emissions,
intermodulation products and frequency conversion products, but exclude
out of band emissions.

In REL8 the spectrum emission mask scales in proportion to the channel
bandwidth due to PA non-linearity for a single component carrier.

##### 11.3.2.5.1 Adjacent Channel Leakage ratio

In REL-8 the ALCR is defined for each channel bandwidth. For
LTE-Advanced, depending on the adjacent channel bandwidth (single or
multiple CC) it may be necessary to investigate the impact of ALCR with
different number of CC.

In this case the transmitter characteristic for ACLR could be defined
for;

\- Intra band contiguous **component** carrier (CC) aggregation

\- Intra band non - contiguous **component** carrier (CC) aggregation

\- Inter band non- contiguous **component** carrier (CC) aggregation

##### 11.3.2.5.2 Spurious emission (UE to UE co-existence)

One aspect relating to the emission spectrum would be UE to UE
co-existence.

In this case the following aspects could be defined;

\- UE1 (Tx) and U2 (Rx) configuration for UE to UE co-existence analysis

\- Generic limit of (-50dBm /1MHz) be applicable for the case of
contiguous CC carrier

\- In the case of inter band scenario exceptions may need to be defined
for harmonic requirements

\- Guard band for TDD non synchronized operation

#### 11.3.2.6 Transmit intermodulation

The transmit intermodulation performance is a measure of the capability
of the transmitter to inhibit the generation of signals in its non
linear elements caused by presence of the wanted signal and an
interfering signal reaching the transmitter via the antenna.

The current RAN1 assumption assumes in the case of contiguous CC
carriers then RB can be freely allocated for the different CC carriers.
In this case intermodulation performance this may need to be defined in
terms; per RB allocation / per CC carrier / all CC.

### 11.3.3 Receiver characteristics

In order to define the consider the applicable Rx characteristic a
number of working assumptions will be needed to ensure the feature is
applicable in terms of UE implementation. Current REL8 working
assumption has assumed some constraints due to complexity and battery
saving

One new form factor that could be consider is Customer Premise Equipment
(CPE) which would have the ability to initial these new features such as
2 Tx antenna port and 4 Rx antenna port as a baseline work assumption in
order to address the Tx characteristics.

Rx characteristic would need to support 3 generic aggregation scenarios
depending on UE capability;

\- Intra band contiguous **component** carrier (CC) aggregation

\- Intra band non - contiguous **component** carrier (CC) aggregation

\- Inter band non-contiguous **component** carrier (CC) aggregation

#### 11.3.3.1 Receiver architecture 

Table 11.3.3-1 illustrates various Rx architectures options for the
three scenarios

scenarios

  Option               Description (Rx architecture)                  Intra Band aggregation   Inter Band aggregation   
                                                                      Contiguous (CC)          Non contiguous (CC)      Non contiguous (CC)
  A                    Single (RF + FFT + baseband) with BW\>20MHz    Yes                                                
  B                    Multiple (RF + FFT + baseband) with BW≤20MHz   Yes                      Yes                      Yes
  -------------------- ---------------------------------------------- ------------------------ ------------------------ ---------------------

Option A

\- UE may adopt a single wideband-capable (i.e., \>20MHz) RF front end
(i.e., mixer, AGC, ADC) and a single FFT, or alternatively multiple
\"legacy\" RF front ends (\<=20MHz) and FFT engines. The choice between
single or multiple transceivers comes down to the comparison of power
consumption, cost, size, and flexibility to support other aggregation
types.

Option B

\- In this case, using a single wideband-capable RF front end is
undesirable in the case of Intra band non contiguous CC due to the
unknown nature of the signal on the \"unusable\" portion of the band. In
the case non adjacent Inter band separate RF front end are necessary.

#### 11.3.3.2 Receiver Sensitivity 

The current reference sensitivity power level REFSENS is the minimum
mean power applied to both the UE antenna ports at which the throughput
shall meet or exceed the requirements for the specified reference
measurement channel

#### 11.3.3.3 Selectivity

ACS is the ratio of the receive filter attenuation on the assigned
channel frequency to the receive filter attenuation on the adjacent
channel(s).

For LTE-Advanced

\- Based on single and/or multiple CC channel bandwidths

\- Need to define power allocation and distribution for RB single and/or
multiple CC Channel bandwidths due to UE Rx operating point (AGC)

#### 11.3.3.4 Blocking performance

The blocking characteristic is a measure of the receiver\'s ability to
receive a wanted signal at its assigned channel frequency in the
presence of an unwanted interferer on frequencies other than those of
the spurious response or the adjacent channels, without this unwanted
input signal causing a degradation of the performance of the receiver
beyond a specified limit.

\- In-band blocking

\- Out of -band blocking

\- Narrow band blocking

For LTE-Advanced

\- Based on single and/or multiple CC channel bandwidths

\- Power allocation for RB single and/or multiple CC channel bandwidths

\- Per Rx antenna ports or across all antenna ports

\- Need to define power allocation and distribution for RB single and/or
multiple CC Channel bandwidths due to UE Rx operating point (AGC)

#### 11.3.3.5 Spurious response

Spurious response is a measure of the receiver\'s ability to receive a
wanted signal on its assigned channel frequency without exceeding a
given degradation due to the presence of an unwanted CW interfering
signal at any other frequency at which a response is obtained i.e. for
which the out of band blocking limit is not met.

#### 11.3.3.6 Intermodulation performance

Intermodulation response rejection is a measure of the capability of the
receiver to receiver a wanted signal on its assigned channel frequency
in the presence of two or more interfering signals which have a specific
frequency relationship to the wanted signal.

For LTE-Advanced

\- Based on single and/or multiple CC channel bandwidths

\- Power allocation for RB single and/or multiple CC channel bandwidths

\- Per Rx antenna ports or across all antenna ports

#### 11.3.3.7 Spurious emission 

The spurious emissions power is the power of emissions generated or
amplified in a receiver that appear at the UE antenna connector.

***11.4 BS RF requirements***
-----------------------------

### 11.4.1 General

LTE-Advanced BS RF requirements extend those of LTE Rel-8 considering
the following component carrier aggregation scenarios:

\- Intra band

\- Contiguous Component Carrier aggregation

\- Non contiguous Component Carrier aggregation

\- Inter band

\- Non contiguous Component Carrier aggregation

Additional RF requirements to support further features of LTE-Advanced
(e.g. uplink single-user spatial multiplexing) are also considered.

LTE-Advanced RF requirements are considered for Base Stations intended
for general-purpose applications based on Wide Area scenarios.
Introduction of other base station classes for LTE-Advanced is not
precluded. The requirements for these may be different than for
general-purpose applications.

Additionally, RF requirements for Relay Node (RN) are considered.

Some of the LTE-Advanced RF requirements may only apply in certain
regions either as optional requirements or set by local and regional
regulation as mandatory requirements. It is normally not stated in the
3GPP specifications under what exact circumstances that the requirements
apply, since this is defined by local or regional regulation.

### 11.4.2 ***Transmitter characteristics***

#### 11.4.2.1 Base Station output power

In LTE Rel-8 the base station maximum output power is defined as the
mean power level per carrier measured at the antenna connector during
the transmitter ON period in a specified reference condition. This can
be extended in LTE-Advanced for a component carrier. The output power of
multiple component carriers can be aggregated.

Base Stations intended for general-purpose applications do not have
limits on the maximum output power. However, there may exist regional
regulatory requirements which limit the maximum output power.

#### 11.4.2.2 Transmitted signal quality

In LTE Rel-8 requirements for transmitted signal quality are defined
for:

\- Frequency error; a measure of the difference between the actual BS
transmit frequency and the assigned frequency of a carrier. The same
source is used for RF frequency and data clock generation.

\- Error Vector Magnitude; a measure of the difference between the ideal
symbols and the measured symbols after the equalization.

\- In case of Tx Diversity and spatial multiplexing, the time alignment
between transmitter branches, i.e. the delay between the signals from
two antennas at the antenna ports

These requirements can be extended in LTE-Advanced on the basis of
component carriers. Additionally, in LTE-Advanced the time alignment
between component carriers is considered.

#### 11.4.2.3 Unwanted emissions

In LTE Rel-8 requirements for unwanted emissions are defined in form of
operating band unwanted emission limits. These operating band unwanted
emission limits are defined from 10 MHz below the lowest frequency of
the downlink operating band up to 10 MHz above the highest frequency of
the downlink operating band. They apply below the lower edge of the
carrier transmitted at the lowest carrier frequency and above the higher
edge of the carrier transmitted at the highest carrier frequency. The
unwanted emission limits in the part of the downlink operating band that
falls in the spurious domain are consistent with ITU-R Recommendation
SM.329.

The concept of operating band unwanted emission limits is also
considered in LTE-Advanced on the basis of component carriers.
Extensions to cater for the case of Non contiguous Component Carrier
aggregation are considered. Furthermore, in case of inter-band
aggregation, operating band unwanted emission limits shall be set in
each of the active bands.

#### 11.4.2.4 Transmitter spurious emissions

The spurious domain covers frequencies, which are separated from the
carrier centre frequency by more than 250% of the necessary bandwidth,
as recommended in ITU-R SM.329. These transmitter spurious emission
limits apply from 9 kHz to 12.75 GHz.

The transmitter spurious emission limits of LTE-Advanced shall comply
with ITU-R SM.329.

### 11.4.3 Receiver characteristics

#### 11.4.3.1 Reference sensitivity level

In LTE Rel-8, the reference sensitivity power level P~REFSENS~ is the
minimum mean power of a carrier received at the antenna connector at
which a throughput requirement shall be met for a specified reference
measurement channel.

For LTE-Advanced extensions of the LTE Rel-8 reference sensitivity are
considered on the basis of component carriers and reflecting carrier
aggregation scenarios.

#### 11.4.3.2 Adjacent Channel Selectivity (ACS), narrow-band blocking, Blocking, Receiver intermodulation

In LTE Rel-8 the following receiver RF requirements are defined:

\- Adjacent channel selectivity (ACS); a measure of the receiver ability
to receive a wanted signal at its assigned channel frequency in the
presence of an adjacent channel signal with a specified centre frequency
offset.

\- Blocking characteristics; a measure of the receiver ability to
receive a wanted signal at its assigned channel in the presence of an
unwanted interferer (specified for in-band blocking and out-of-band
blocking)

\- Intermodulation response rejection; a measure of the capability of
the receiver to receive a wanted signal on its assigned channel
frequency in the presence of two interfering signals which have a
specific frequency relationship to the wanted signal.

Extensions of these receiver RF requirements are also considered in
LTE-Advanced on the basis of component carriers. Suitable extensions
regarding the centre frequency offset of the interfering signal(s) to
cater for the case of contiguous as well as non-contiguous Component
Carrier aggregation are considered. Furthermore, in case of inter-band
aggregation, appropriate requirements shall be set in each of the active
bands.

#### 11.4.3.3 Performance requirements

In LTE Rel-8, demodulation performance requirements for the BS are
specified for defined fixed reference channels and propagation
conditions. These shall be extended for the component carriers of
LTE-Advanced considering support of carrier aggregation.

12 Mobility enhancements
========================

As LTE Rel-8, LTE-Advanced supports mobility across the cellular network
and is optimized for low mobile speed from 0 to 15 km/h. Higher mobile
speed between 15 and 120 km/h are also supported with high performance.
Mobility across the cellular network can be maintained at speeds from
120 km/h to 350 km/h (or even up to 500 km/h depending on the frequency
band). The impact of intra LTE-Advanced handovers on quality (e.g.
interruption time) is less than or equal to that provided by handovers
in LTE. LTE-Advanced also support techniques and mechanisms to optimize
delay and packet loss during intra system handover:

\- The subframe size of 1 ms makes LTE-Advanced capable of adapting to
fast changing radio link conditions and allows exploitation of multiuser
diversity;

\- The use of scheduled and diversity resource allocation in the
frequency domain allows optimisation for various speeds, i.e., the
diversity resource allocation increases frequency diversity gain at high
speeds, whereas the scheduled resource allocation increases multiuser
diversity gain at low speeds;

\- Forwarding of the data buffered in the source eNB to the target eNB
prevents packet loss at handovers;

\- The measurements for intra-frequency neighbour cells are performed
without gaps, hence without wasting radio resources. The relevant
measurements for neighbour cells that operate on a different carrier
frequency from the currently served frequency, are performed during
transmission/reception gaps provided by DTX/DRX, or by the packet
scheduler.

13 TS 36.133 \[17\] requirements enhancements
=============================================

As already in LTE Rel-8 and also in LTE-Advanced robust general minimum
RRM requirements ensure good mobility performance across the cellular
network for various mobile speeds and different network deployments. The
minimum RRM requirements are defined both in idle mode and in active
mode. In Active mode the requirements are defined both without DRX and
with DRX in order to ensure that good mobility performance in all cases
while still minimising UE battery consumption especially with long DRX
cycles. Different network controlled parameter values for cell
reselection in idle mode and for handover in active mode can be utilised
for optimising mobility performance in different scenarios, which also
include low mobility and high mobility scenarios.

14 MBMS Enhancements
====================

The MBMS baseline in LTE-Advanced is the one being introduced in LTE
Rel-9 where MBMS can be provided in with single frequency network mode
of operation (MBSFN). This multi-cell transmission is characterized by
synchronous transmission by eNBs and their combining at the UE. The
content synchronization across eNBs is guaranteed through synchronised
radio frame timing, common configuration of the radio protocol stack and
usage of a SYNC protocol in the CN. Multi-cell transmission doubles
spectral efficiency in downlink compared to single-cell one.

15 SON Enhancements
===================

To ease network performance analyses and minimize operational effort,
LTE-Advanced extends LTE with the support of the following self
optimization features:

\- Coverage and capacity optimisation: aims at providing continuous
coverage and optimal capacity of the network, by measurements derived in
the network. Call drop rates give a first indication for areas with
insufficient coverage, traffic counters identify capacity problems.
Since coverage and capacity are linked, ability to balance the trade-off
between the two of them should be possible;

\- Mobility robustness optimization: mobility parameters optimisation to
reduce the number of HO-related radio link failures. As Incorrect HO
parameter settings, even if it does not result in radio link failure,
may lead to serious degradation of the service performance, the
avoidance of ping-pong effect or prolonged connection to non-optimal
cell is a secondary objective of Mobility robustness optimization;

\- Mobility load balancing: optimisation of cell reselection/handover
parameters in order to cope with the unequal traffic load and to
minimize the number of handovers and redirections needed to achieve the
load balancing;

\- RACH Optimization: an automatic RACH optimization function monitors
the prevailing conditions, e.g., a change on RACH load, uplink
interference, and determines and updates the appropriate parameters in
order to minimize access delays for all UEs in the system and RACH load.

In addition to SON, the Minimisation of Drive Tests functionality
creates an enhanced and combined effort to optimize the performance of
the network. The function aims to automate the collection of UE
measurements and thus minimize the need for operators to rely on manual
drive-tests. The feedback from UE experiencing problems (i.e. lack of
coverage, traffic is unevenly distributed or the user throughput is low)
gives a beneficial overview about the network. Thus logging and
reporting various UE measurement data provides foundation for network
optimization. Furthermore the collected field measurements may be used
for a wide scope of SON use cases.

16 Self-Evaluation Report on \"LTE Release 10 and beyond (LTE-Advanced)\"
=========================================================================

The evaluation results provided here are in support of the submission of
the 3GPP \"*LTE Release 10 & beyond (LTE-Advanced)\"* to the ITU-R as a
candidate technology for the IMT-Advanced. This information supports the
completion of the compliance templates described in clause 4.2.4. of
Report ITU-R M.2133 \[7\].

The 3GPP submission to the ITU-R includes the following templates
organized as an FDD Radio Interface Technology component (FDD RIT) and
as a TDD Radio Interface Technology component (TDD RIT). Together the
FDD RIT and the TDD RIT comprise a Set of Radio Interface Technologies
(SRIT).

The 3GPP developed FDD RIT and TDD RIT templates include characteristics
and link budget templates and compliance templates for services,
spectrum, and technical performance. These templates are found in Annex
C.

The capabilities addressed here span the capabilities from LTE Rel-8 and
extend through Rel-10 and beyond. As such the capabilities represent a
range of possible functionalities and solutions that might be adopted by
3GPP in the work on the further specifications of LTE.

The ITU-R documents in the references \[7-10\], the work of 3GPP and
individual companies was utilized in the preparation of this
self-evaluation report.

***16.1 Peak*** spectral efficiency
-----------------------------------

Tables 16.1-1 and 16.1-2 show the downlink peak spectral efficiency for
FDD and TDD, respectively. The spectral efficiency is derived based on
the following assumptions: 20 MHz bandwidth, one symbol L1/L2 control,
cell-specific reference signals corresponding to one and four
cell-specific antenna ports, UE-specific reference signals corresponding
to 24 and zero resource elements per resource-block pair, and PBCH/SS
occupying a total of 564 and 528 resource elements per radio frame for
DL 8 and 4-layer spatial multiplexing, respectively. In addition, UL/DL
configuration 1 (2DL:1SP:2UL) and special-subframe configuration 4
(12DwPTS:1GP:1UpPTS, UpPTS for SRS transmission) are assumed in case of
TDD.

The tables show that already LTE Rel-8 fulfills the ITU requirements in
terms of downlink peak spectral efficiency. *Thus it can be concluded
that any of the evaluated LTE configurations fulfill the ITU
requirements on downlink peak spectral efficiency.* The table also
illustrates the further improved performance that can be achieved by
using additional technology features (downlink 8-layer spatial
multiplexing).

Tables 16.1-3 and 4 show the uplink peak spectral efficiency for FDD and
TDD respectively. The spectral efficiency is derived based on the
following assumptions: 20 MHz bandwidth, PUCCH of 2 resource block pairs
per subframe and PRACH of 6 resource block pairs per radio frame. The
same UL/DL and special-subframe configurations are assumed as for the
downlink peak-spectral efficiency calculation, see above.

The tables show that the extension of LTE Rel-8 with 2-layer spatial
multiplexing fulfills the ITU requirements in UL. *Thus it can be
concluded that any of the evaluated LTE configurations fulfill the ITU
requirements on uplink peak spectral efficiency.* The tables also
illustrate the further improved performance that can be achieved by
using additional technology features (uplink 4-layer spatial
multiplexing).

***16.2 C-plane latency***
--------------------------

### 16.2.1 Idle to Connected

The different steps involved in the transition from Idle to Connected
mode in LTE-Advanced are depicted on Figure 16.2.1-1 below:

Figure 16.2.1-1: From Idle to Connected mode

Taking LTE Release 8 as a baseline (see Annex B) and including the
improvements described in clause 10.1, the transition time from Idle to
Connected mode can be reduced to 50ms as summarized in Table 16.2.1-1
below. Note that since the NAS setup portion is executed in parallel to
the RRC one thanks to the combined request, it does not appear in the
total (assuming that that the total delay of steps 11-14 is shorter than
or equal to the total delay of steps 7-10...). *Thus it can be concluded
that any of the evaluated LTE configurations fulfill the ITU
requirements on C-plane latency for Idle to Connected transition.*

### 16.2.2 Dormant to Active

As an example, the different steps involved in the transition from a
Dormant to an Active state when the UE is already synchronised are
depicted on Figure 16.2.2-1 below:

![](media/image11.wmf){width="2.727777777777778in" height="2.28125in"}

Figure 16.2.2-1: Dormant to Active transition for synchronised UE

Taking LTE Release 8 as a baseline (see Annex B) and includuding the
PUCCH periodicity improvement described in clause 10.2, the transition
time from a Dormant to an Active state when the UE is already
synchronised can be reduced to 9.5 ms as summarized in Table 16.2.2-1
below. *Thus it can be concluded that any of the evaluated LTE
configurations fulfill the ITU requirements on C-plane latency for Idle
to Connected transition.*

  ----------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------

***16.3 U-Plane latency***
--------------------------

As highlighted in clause 10.2, LTE Rel-8 already benefits from a U-Plane
latency below 10ms (see Annex B) for synchronised UEs. In situations
where the UE does not have a valid scheduling assignment, or when the UE
needs to synchronize and obtain a scheduling assignment, a reduced RACH
scheduling period, shorter PUCCH cycle and reduced processing delays as
described in clause 10.1 could be used. *Thus it can be concluded that
any of the evaluated LTE configurations fulfill the ITU requirements on
U-plane latency for Idle to Connected transition.*

***16.4 Spectral efficiency and user throughput***
--------------------------------------------------

Cell spectral efficiency and cell-edge spectral efficiency are evaluated
through extensive simulations conducted by a number of companies. The
simulation assumptions applied in the following evaluations are shown in
Annex A. Detailed information covering a range of possible
configurations is provided in Annex A.3 and \[13\]. In the tables below
a subset of the configurations is provided from the data in \[13\]. This
provides a representative selection of current and possible capabilities
in various configurations that could be deployed.

For downlink, cell spectral efficiency and cell-edge spectral efficiency
are evaluated by assuming overhead corresponding to downlink control
channels that spans *L* OFDM symbols with *L* = 1, *L* = 2 and *L* = 3.
Each value in the table is obtained as an average of all the samples
obtained by different companies. The number of samples is also shown in
each table.

All the results below show that the requirement is fulfilled with *L* =
3, corresponding to the largest overhead except the system bandwidth 1.4
MHz. Relaxing the overhead assumption to *L* = 1 and 2 further enhances
the throughput performance.

### 16.4.1 Cell spectral efficiency and cell-edge spectral efficiency

#### 16.4.1.1 Indoor

Tables 16.4.1.1-1 and16.4.1.1-2 show the downlink spectral-efficiency
results in the indoor environment (InH (Indoor Hotspot) channel model)
for FDD and TDD, respectively. The tables show that already LTE Rel-8
with SU-MIMO 4 x 2 fulfills the ITU requirements. *Thus it can be
concluded that any of the evaluated LTE configurations fulfill the ITU
requirements on downlink cell-average and cell-edge spectral efficiency
for the indoor environment.* The tables also illustrate the further
improved performance that can be achieved by using additional technology
features.

Tables 16.4.1.1-3 and16.4.1.1-4 show the uplink spectral efficiency
results in the indoor environment (InH channel model) for FDD and TDD,
respectively. The tables show that already LTE Rel-8 with SIMO 1 x 4
fulfills the ITU requirements. *Thus it can be concluded that any of the
evaluated LTE configurations fulfill the ITU requirements on uplink
cell-average and cell-edge spectral efficiency for the indoor
environment.* The tables also illustrate the further improved
performance that can be achieved by using additional technology
features.

#### 16.4.1.2 Microcellular

Tables 16.4.1.2-1 and16.4.1.2-2 show the downlink spectral efficiency
results in the microcellular environment (UMi (Urban Micro) channel
model) for FDD and TDD, respectively. The tables show that, with the
extension of LTE Rel-8 with MU-MIMO 4 x 2, the ITU requirements are
fulfilled. *Thus it can be concluded that any of the evaluated LTE
configurations fulfill the ITU requirements on downlink cell-average and
cell-edge spectral efficiency for the microcellular environment.* The
tables also illustrate the further improved performance that can be
achieved by using additional technology features.

Tables 16.4.1.4-3 and16.4.1.4-4 show the uplink spectral efficiency
results in the high speed environment (RMa channel model) for FDD and
TDD, respectively. The tables show that already LTE Rel-8 with SIMO 1 x
4 fulfills the ITU requirements. *Thus it can be concluded that any of
the evaluated LTE configurations fulfill the ITU requirements on uplink
cell-average and cell-edge spectral efficiency for the high speed
environment.* The tables also illustrate the further improved
performance that can be achieved by using additional technology
features.

### 16.4.2 Number of supported VoIP users

The number of supported VoIP users (VoIP capacity) is evaluated through
extensive simulations conducted by a number of companies. The simulation
assumptions applied in the following evaluations are shown in Annex A.
Detailed information covering a range of possible configurations is
provided in Annex A.3 and \[13\]. In the tables below the results are
provided by LTE Rel-8.

Tables 16.4.2-1 and16.4.2-2 show the VoIP capacity results in the
Indoor, Microcellular, Base coverage urban and High speed for FDD and
TDD, respectively. The tables show that already LTE Rel-8 fulfills the
ITU requirements. *Thus it can be concluded that any of the evaluated
LTE configurations fulfill the ITU requirements on VoIP capacity for all
the environments.*

### 16.4.3 Mobility traffic channel link data rates

Mobility traffic channel link data rates are evaluated through extensive
simulations conducted by a number of companies. The simulation
assumptions applied in the following evaluations are shown in Annex A.
Detailed information covering a range of possible configurations is
provided in Annex A.3 and \[13\]. In the tables below the results are
conducted by LTE Rel-8.

Tables 16.4.3-1 and16.4.3-2 show the mobility traffic channel link data
rates in the Indoor, Microcellular, Base coverage urban and High speed
for FDD and TDD, respectively. The tables show that already LTE Rel-8
fulfills the ITU requirements. *Thus it can be concluded that any of the
evaluated LTE configurations fulfill the ITU requirements on mobility
traffic channel link date rate for all the environments.*

***16.5 Handover Performance***
-------------------------------

The generic handover procedure of LTE-Advanced builds upon the one
developed for LTE and is shown in Figure 16.5-1 below:

![](media/image12.wmf){width="4.893055555555556in"
height="4.129166666666666in"}

Figure 16.5-1: U-Plane interruption in LTE-Advanced

Once the HO command has been processed by the UE, it leaves the source
cell and stops receiving data. This is the point in time where data
interruption starts. The first step after that is the radio
synchronisation, which consists of:

1\) Frequency synchronization: typically the time taken for frequency
synchronisation depends on whether the target cell is operating on the
same carrier frequency as the currently served frequency or not. But
since the UE has already identified and measured the target cell, this
delay is negligible

2\) DL synchronization: although baseband and RF alignments always take
some time, since the UE has already acquired DL synchronisation to the
target cell in conjunction with previous measurement and can relate the
target cell DL timing to the source cell DL timing with an offset, the
corresponding delay is less than 1 ms.

Because forwarding is initiated before the UE moves and establishes
connection to the target cell and because the backhaul is faster than
the radio interface, forwarded data is already awaiting transmission in
the target when the UE is ready to receive. This component therefore
does not affect the overall delay.

In FDD RIT, the average delay due to RACH scheduling period is 0.5ms in
the best case (1ms RACH periodicity). In TDD RIT, although the shortest
delay is obtained with configuration 0 (offering 6 normal uplink
subframes), when factoring in the average waiting time for a downlink
subframe to receive the RA response and initiate the transmission of DL
data, configuration 1 (with random access preambles in special
subframes) offers the shortest U-Plane interruption.

In total, the interruption time is 10.5ms for FDD RIT and 12.5ms for TDD
RIT as summarized in Tables 16.5-1 and 16.5-2 respectively below. Note
that this delay does not depend on the frequency of the target as long
as the cell has already been measured by the UE, which is a typical
scenario.

### 16.5.1 Intra-frequency handover interruption time

As explained in clause 16.5 above, the interruption is 10.5ms for FDD
RIT and 12.5ms for TDD RIT regardless of the frequency of the target
cell. *Thus it can be concluded that any of the evaluated LTE
configurations fulfill the ITU requirements on intra-frequency handover
interruption time.*

### 16.5.2 Inter-frequency handover interruption time within a spectrum band

As explained in clause 16.5 above, the interruption is 10.5ms for FDD
RIT and 12.5ms for TDD RIT regardless of the frequency of the target
cell. *Thus it can be concluded that any of the evaluated LTE
configurations fulfill the ITU requirements on inter-frequency handover
interruption time within a spectrum band.*

### 16.5.3 Inter-frequency handover interruption time between spectrum bands

As explained in clause 16.5 above, the interruption is 10.5ms for FDD
RIT and 12.5ms for TDD RIT regardless of the frequency of the target
cell. *Thus it can be concluded that any of the evaluated LTE
configurations fulfill the ITU requirements on inter-frequency handover
interruption time between spectrum bands.*

***16.6 Spectrum and bandwidth***
---------------------------------

### 16.6.1 Deployment in IMT bands

The bands in which the proposed FDD RIT component and TDD RIT component
can be deployed are given in 11.2.2.

Both the FDD RIT and the TDD RIT fulfil the requirement of being able to
utilize at least one band identified for IMT.

### 16.6.2 Bandwidth and channel bandwidth scalability

In both the FDD RIT and the TDD RIT, one component carrier supports a
scalable bandwidth, 1.4, 3, 5, 10, 15 and 20 MHz (see 11.2.1.1). By
aggregating multiple component carriers, wider transmission bandwidths
up to 100 MHz are supported (see 5.1).

Both the FDD RIT and the TDD RIT fulfil the requirement to support a
scalable bandwidth up to and including 40 MHz.

Both the FDD RIT and the TDD RIT fulfil the requirement to support of at
least three band-width values.

***16.7 Services***
-------------------

The Quality of Service (QoS) framework of LTE-Advanced builds upon the
one developed for LTE and therefore allows the support of a wide range
of services. In LTE-Advanced, a bearer is the level of granularity for
QoS control. Each bearer can be associated with several QoS parameters,
e.g.:

\- QoS Class Identifier (QCI): scalar that is used as a reference to
access node-specific parameters that control bearer level packet
forwarding treatment (e.g. scheduling weights, admission thresholds,
queue management thresholds, link layer protocol configuration, etc.),
and that have been pre-configured by the operator owning the eNodeB. A
one-to-one mapping of standardized QCI values to standardized
characteristics is for instance captured in \[4\] for LTE.

\- Guaranteed Bit Rate (GBR): the bit rate that can be expected to be
provided by a GBR bearer,

The configuration of those QoS parameters, allows LTE-Advanced to
support a wide range of services. In particular, LTE-Advanced can
support basic conversational service class, rich conversational service
class and conversational low delay service class. In addition,
LTE-Advanced is also able to support the service classes of interactive
high delay, interactive low delay, streaming live, streaming non-live
and background, which are also given in clause 7.4.4 of Report ITU-R
M.2135. *Thus it can be concluded that any of the evaluated LTE
configurations fulfill the ITU requirements on C-plane latency for Idle
to Connected transition.*

16.8 Conclusions of the Self-Evaluation
---------------------------------------

Under the IMT-Advanced process, as provided in \[11\], Step 6 is a
decision step taking into account consideration of the evaluation
results and is an assessment of the proposal as to whether it meets a
version of the minimum technical requirements and evaluation criteria of
the IMT‑Advanced currently in force. The 3GPP self-evaluation concludes
that the *LTE Release 10 & beyond (LTE-Advanced)* SRIT and the
individual FDD RIT and TDD RIT components completely satisfy the
criteria of Step 6 and should move forward to Step 7 of the process.

Under the IMT-Advanced process, as provided in \[11\], Step 7 is a
decision step taking into account consideration of the evaluation
results. In Step 7 an RIT or SRIT will be accepted for inclusion in the
standardization phase described in Step 8 of the process if it is
determined that the RIT or SRIT meets the requirements for at least
three of the four the required test environments. The 3GPP
self-evaluation concludes that the *LTE Release 10 & beyond
(LTE-Advanced)* SRIT and the individual FDD RIT and TDD RIT components
completely satisfy the criteria of Step 7 and should move forward to
Step 8 of the process. In particular, the SRIT and the individual FDD
RIT and TDD RIT components meet all the requirements in all four of the
four defined test environments.

Consequently, the 3GPP *LTE Release 10 & beyond (LTE-Advanced)*
technology should be included in the ITU-R IMT-Advanced terrestrial
component radio interface Recommendation(s).

16A Performance Evaluation of LTE-Advanced for 3GPP target fulfillment 
======================================================================

This chapter provide cell spectral efficiency and cell-edge spectral
efficiency results of LTE-Advanced technologies evaluated through
extensive simulations conducted by a number of companies. System
performance requirements defined in 3GPP are shown in \[3\], where the
target values of cell spectral efficiency and cell-edge spectral
efficiency are provided for 3GPP Case 1 channel model with 2-by-2,
4-by-2, and 4-by-4 antenna configurations for downlink and 1-by-2 and
2-by-4 antenna configurations for uplink. More details of the
performance evaluation assumptions and results are shown in \[18\].

Tables 16A-1 and16A-2 show the downlink spectral efficiency results in
the 3GPP Case1 environment for FDD and TDD, respectively. The tables
show that, with the extension of LTE Rel-8 with MU-MIMO 4 x 2, the 3GPP
targets are fulfilled. *Thus it can be concluded that any of the
evaluated LTE configurations fulfill the 3GPP targets on downlink
cell-average and cell-edge spectral efficiency for the3GPP Case1
environment.* The tables also illustrate the further improved
performance that can be achieved by using additional technology
features.

17 Conclusions
==============

During the study of LTE-Advanced, many proposals on physical and higher
layer radio protocols, NW architecture, RF related issues were
investigated. Proposed technical features are built based on those of
the LTE Rel-8, aiming at further performance enhancement. It was shown
that, with the existing and the new capabilities addressed in this
document, the ITU-R requirements as well as the 3GPP
requirements/targets are fulfilled. Feasibility of the new capabilities
for LTE-Advanced has been proven. As a result, the LTE-Advanced study
item can be closed and work items and specific study items corresponding
to selected features studied under the LTE-Advanced study item can be
approved.

A.2 CoMP assumption for evaluation
==================================

For the performance evaluation of DL CoMP schemes, following two types
of CoMP categories were evaluated.

\- Joint Processing (JP): data is available at each of the geometrically
separated points, and PDSCH transmission occurs from multiple points.

\- Coordinated Scheduling/Beamforming (CS/CB): data is only available at
serving cell (data transmission from that point) but user
scheduling/beamforming decisions are made with coordination among cells.

######### Annex B: Latency performance of Rel-8

B.1 C-plane latency
===================

B.1.1 Transition IDLE to CONNECTED
----------------------------------

Figure B.1 provides an example C-plane flow for the IDLE to CONNECTED
transition for Rel-8.

Figure B.1.1-1: C-plane activation procedure (example for Rel-8)

### B.1.1.1 FDD frame structure

Table B.1.1.1-1 provides a timing analysis, assuming FDD frame
structure, of the flow depicted in Figure B.1.1-1. The analysis
illustrates that the state transition from IDLE to CONNECTED can be
achieved within a minimum of 76ms, with 3ms msg2 window and 1ms PRACH
cycle. Considering more reasonable settings (5ms msg2 window and 5ms
PRACH cycle), a 80ms transition time is achieved.

### B.1.1.2 TDD frame structure

Table B.1.1.2-1 provides a timing analysis, assuming TDD frame structure
(UL/DL configuration \#1), of the flow depicted in Figure B.1.1-1 The
analysis illustrates that the state transition from IDLE to CONNECTED
can be achieved within a minimum of 82.6ms, with 3ms msg2 window and
maximum PRACH density in time domain (e.g. PRACH configuration Index =
12). Considering more reasonable settings (5ms msg2 window and 5ms PRACH
cycle), a 84.6ms transition time is achieved.

B.1.2 Transition Dormant to Active
----------------------------------

In the dormant state, the UE has an established RRC connection and radio
bearers; it is thus known at cell level but may be in DRX to save power
during temporary inactivity. The UE may be either synchronized or
unsynchronized. For the purpose of the analysis presented in this
clause, error free transmission of data and signalling is assumed, and
the DRX cycle is not considered.

### B.1.2.1 FDD frame structure

#### B.1.2.1.1 Uplink initiated transition, synchronized

Table B.1.2.1.1-1 provides a timing analysis, assuming FDD frame
structure and a PUCCH allocation for scheduling request of 5ms, of the
uplink state transition for a UE with uplink synchronization. The
analysis illustrates that the uplink transition from dormant to active
for a synchronized UE can be achieved within 11.5ms.

#### B.1.2.1.3 Downlink initiated transition, synchronized

A UE with uplink synchronization monitors PDCCH during the on-duration
time of the DRX cycle, and there is thus no additional delay component
apart from the DRX cycle when compared to the case of the uplink
initiated for a synchronized UE.

#### B.1.2.1.4 Downlink initiated transition, unsynchronized

Table B.1.2.1.4-1 provides a timing analysis, assuming FDD frame
structure, of the downlink state transition for a UE without uplink
synchronization. For the downlink initiated transition, a dedicated
preamble is assumed and no contention resolution is needed. The analysis
illustrates that the downlink transition from dormant to active for an
unsynchronized UE can be achieved within a minimum of 13.5ms, with 1ms
PRACH cycle and a 3ms msg2 window.

#### B.1.2.2.3 Downlink initiated transition, synchronized

A UE with uplink synchronization monitors PDCCH during the on-duration
time of the DRX cycle, and there is thus no additional delay component
apart from the DRX cycle when compared to the case of the uplink
initiated for a synchronized UE.

#### B.1.2.2.4 Downlink initiated transition, unsynchronized

Tables B.1.2.2.4-1a and B.1.2.2.4-1b provide a timing analysis, assuming
TDD frame structure (UL/DL configuration\#1), of the downlink state
transition for a UE without uplink synchronization. For the downlink
initiated transition, a dedicated preamble is assumed and no contention
resolution is needed. The analysis illustrates that the downlink
transition from dormant to active for an unsynchronized UE can be
achieved within a minimum of 16.5ms, with 3ms msg2 window and maximum
PRACH density in time domain (e.g. PRACH configuration Index=12).

B.2 U-plane latency
===================

B.2.1 FDD frame structure
-------------------------

The LTE U-plane one way latency for a scheduled UE consists of the fixed
node processing delays (which includes radio frame alignment) and 1ms
TTI duration for FDD as shown in Figure B.2.1-1. Considering that the
number of HARQ processes is fixed to 8 for FDD, the one-way latency can
calculated as:

DUP \[ms\] = 1.5 + 1 + 1.5+ n\*8 = 4 + n\*8,

where n is the number of HARQ retransmissions. Considering a typical
case where there would be 0 or 1 retransmission, the approximate average
U-plane latency is given by

D~UP,typical~ \[ms\] = 4 + p\*8,

where p is the error probability of the first HARQ retransmission. The
minimum latency is achieved for a 0% BLER, but a more reasonable setting
is 10% HARQ BLER.

D~UP,0%HARQ\_BLER~ \[ms\] = 4 (0% HARQ BLER)

D~UP,10%HARQ\_BLER~ \[ms\] = 4.8 (10% HARQ BLER)

Figure B.2.1-1: User plane latency components for FDD

B.2.2 TDD frame structure
-------------------------

The LTE U-plane one way latency for a scheduled UE consists of the fixed
node processing delays, radio frame alignment and TTI duration for TDD
as shown in Figure B.2.2-1.

\(a\) Downlink

\(b\) Uplink

Figure B.2.2-1: User plane latency components for TDD

Where:

a\) The total one-way processing time is 2.5ms.

b\) is radio frame alignment and depends on the frame structure.

c\) The TTI duration is 1ms.

Based on the assumptions above, the LTE U-plane latency is given by:

D~UP~ \[ms\] = 1 + + 1 + 1.5 + n\*

where is the average HARQ RTT and n is the number of HARQ
retransmissions. In typical cases there would be 0 or 1 re-transmissions
yielding an approximate average U-plane latency of

D~UP,typical~ \[ms\] = 3.5 + + p\*

where p is the error probability of the first HARQ transmission. Tables
B.2.2-2a and B.2.2-2b show the U-plane latency in downlink and uplink,
respectively, for different TDD UL/DL configuration when 0% HARQ BLER is
assumed.
