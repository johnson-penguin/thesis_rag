3 Definitions, symbols and abbreviations
========================================

3.1 Definitions
---------------

For the purposes of the present document, the terms and definitions
given in TR 21.905 \[1\] and the following apply. A term defined in the
present document takes precedence over the definition of the same term,
if any, in TR 21.905 \[1\].

**access link:** Link for communication between Relay and UE.

**backhaul link:** Link for communication between Relay and BS.

**carrier: The modulated waveform conveying the E-UTRA or UTRA physical
channels**

**channel bandwidth:** The RF bandwidth supporting a single E-UTRA RF
carrier with the transmission bandwidth configured in the uplink or
downlink of a cell. The channel bandwidth is measured in MHz and is used
as a reference for transmitter and receiver RF requirements.

**channel edge:** The lowest and highest frequency of the E-UTRA
carrier, separated by the channel bandwidth.

**in-band relay:** A Relay where the access link and backhaul link
operates in the same operating band.

**measurement bandwidth**: The bandwidth in which an emission level is
specified.

**occupied bandwidth:** The width of a frequency band such that, below
the lower and above the upper frequency limits, the mean powers emitted
are each equal to a specified percentage β/2 of the total mean power of
a given emission.

**RRC filtered mean power:** The mean power of a UTRA carrier as
measured through a root raised cosine filter with roll-off factor α and
a bandwidth equal to the chip rate of the radio access mode.

NOTE: The RRC filtered mean power of a perfectly modulated UTRA signal
is 0.246 dB lower than the mean power of the same signal.

**transmission bandwidth:** Bandwidth of an instantaneous transmission
from a UE or BS, measured in Resource Block units.

**transmission bandwidth configuration:** The highest transmission
bandwidth allowed for uplink or downlink in a given channel bandwidth,
measured in Resource Block units.

4. General test conditions and declarations
===========================================

Many of the tests in this specification measure a parameter relative to
a value that is not fully specified in the E-UTRA specifications. For
these tests, the Minimum Requirement is determined relative to a nominal
value specified by the manufacturer.

Certain functions of a relay are optional in the E-UTRA specifications.
Furthermore some requirements for the relay may be regional as listed in
clause 4.3.

When specified in a test, the manufacturer shall declare the nominal
value of a parameter, or whether an option is supported.

4.1 Measurement uncertainties and Test Requirements
---------------------------------------------------

### 4.1.1 General

The requirements of this clause apply to all applicable tests in the
present document.

The Minimum Requirements are given in 36.116 \[2\] except that they
apply to a relay node and test requirements are given in this
specification. Test Tolerances are defined in Annex G of TS 36.141 \[3\]
and in Annex F of TS36.521-1 \[7\]. Test Tolerances are individually
calculated for each test. The Test Tolerances are used to relax the
Minimum Requirements in TS 36.116 \[2\] to create Test Requirements.

### 4.1.2 Acceptable uncertainty of Test System

The maximum acceptable uncertainty of the Test System is specified below
for each test, where appropriate. The Test System shall enable the
stimulus signals in the test case to be adjusted to within the specified
tolerance and the equipment under test to be measured with an
uncertainty not exceeding the specified values. All tolerances and
uncertainties are absolute values, and are valid for a confidence level
of 95%, unless otherwise stated.

A confidence level of 95% is the measurement uncertainty tolerance
interval for a specific measurement that contains 95% of the performance
of a population of test equipment.

For RF tests, it should be noted that the uncertainties in clause 4.1.2
apply to the Test System operating into a nominal 50 ohm load and do not
include system effects due to mismatch between the DUT and the Test
System.

#### 4.1.2.1 Measurement of relay access transmitter

The maximum test system uncertainty for relay access transmitter test
shall be as defined in Table 4.1.2.1 of TS 36.141 \[3\] except that the
requirements apply to relay nodes.

#### 4.1.2.2 Measurement of relay access receiver

The maximum test system uncertainty for relay access receiver tests
shall be as defined in Table 4.1.2.2 of TS 36.141 \[3\] except that the
requirements apply to relay nodes.

#### 4.1.2.3 Measurement of performance requirement

The maximum test system uncertainty for relay access performance
requirements shall be as defined in Table 4.1.2.3 of TS 36.141 \[3\]
except that the requirements apply to relay nodes.

4.2 Relay classes
-----------------

The Relay classes are defined based on the RF scenarios expected for the
Relay access deployment, defined in terms of the Minimum Coupling Loss
(MCL) between Relay and UE. The following definitions are used:

\- High-CL Relay are characterised by requirements derived from outdoor
Relay scenarios with a Relay to UE minimum coupling loss equals to 59 dB

\- Low-CL Relay are characterised by requirements derived from indoor
Relay scenarios with a Relay to UE minimum coupling loss equals to 45 dB

4.3 Regional requirements
-------------------------

Some requirements in the present document may only apply in certain
regions either as optional requirements or set by local and regional
regulation as mandatory requirements. It is normally not stated in the
3GPP specifications under what exact circumstances that the requirements
apply, since this is defined by local or regional regulation.

Table 4.3-1 of 36.141 \[3\] lists all the requirements that may be
applied differently to relay nodes in different regions.

4.4 Selection of configurations for testing
-------------------------------------------

The requirements for selection of configurations for testing shall be
the same as in clauses 4.4 and 4.5 of TS 36.141 \[3\] except that the
requirements shall apply to relay nodes.

4.5 Manufacturer\'s declarations of regional and optional requirements
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The requirements for manufacturer\'s declarations of regional and
optional requirements shall be the same as in clause 4.6 of TS 36.141
\[3\] except that the requirements shall apply to relay nodes.

4.6 Specified frequency range and supported channel bandwidth
-------------------------------------------------------------

The requirements for specified frequency range and supported channel
bandwidth requirements shall be the same as in clause 4.6 of TS 36.141
\[3\] except that the requirements shall apply to relay nodes.

4.7 Format and interpretation of tests
--------------------------------------

5 Operating bands and Channel arrangement
=========================================

5.1 General
-----------

The channel arrangements presented in this clause are based on the
operating bands and channel bandwidths defined in the present release of
specifications.

NOTE: Other operating bands and channel bandwidths may be considered in
future releases.

5.2 Operating bands
-------------------

E-UTRA is designed to operate in the operating bands defined in Table
5.5-1 of TS 36.104 \[4\].

5.3 Channel bandwidth
---------------------

Requirements in the present document are specified for the channel
bandwidths listed in Table 5.6-1 of TS 36.104 \[4\].

For the access link the manufacturer shall declare the channel
bandwidths supported by the Relay.

For the backhaul link the Relay shall support the channel bandwidths
denoted by \"Yes\" in Table 5.6.1-1 of TS 36.101 \[6\] for the supported
operating band. Note 1 in Table 5.6.1-1 does not apply.

5.4 Channel arrangement
-----------------------

The channel spacing is specified in clause 5.7.1 of TS 36.104 \[4\].

The channel raster is specified in clause 5.7.2 of TS 36.104 \[4\].

Carrier frequency and EARFCN is specified in clause 5.7.3 of TS 36.104
\[4\].

6. Transmitter characteristics
==============================

6.1 General
-----------

General test conditions for transmitter tests are given in clause 4,
including interpretation of measurement results and configurations for
testing. Test configurations are defined in clause 4.5 of TS 36.141
\[3\] except that they apply to relays, while Annex H of TS 36.141 \[3\]
provides an informative description of E-UTRAN test cases.

### 6.1.1 E-UTRA Test Models

The set-up of physical channels for the access transmitter tests shall
be according to one of the E-UTRA test models (E-TM) defined in clause
6.1.1 of TS 36.141 \[3\] except that they apply to relay nodes.

The set-up of physical channels for the backhaul transmitter tests shall
be according to one of the E-UTRA test models (E-TM) defined in clause
4.1 of TS 36.508 \[8\] except that they apply to relay nodes. The
following reference test conditions shall apply

Test Environment: Normal, as defined in TS 36.508 \[8\] clause 4.1.

Frequencies to be tested: Mid Range, as defined in TS 36.508 \[8\]
clause 4.3.1.1.

Channel Bandwidths to be tested: 10MHz, as defined in TS 36.508 \[8\]
clause 4.3.1.1.

6.2 Output power
----------------

### 6.2.1 Definition and applicability

Output power, Pout, of the relay is the mean power of one carrier
delivered to a load with resistance equal to the nominal load impedance
of the transmitter.

The maximum total output power (Pmax), of the relay is the mean power
level measured at the antenna connector during the transmitter ON period
in a specified reference condition.

Rated total output power of the relay is the mean power for relay
operating in single carrier or multiple carrier configurations that the
manufacturer has declared to be available at the antenna connector
during the transmitter ON period.

Relay maximum output power (Pmax, c), of the relay is the mean power
level per carrier measured at the antenna connector during the
transmitter ON period in a specified reference condition.

The rated output power, PRAT, is the mean power level that the
manufacturer has declared to be available at the antenna connector
during the transmitter ON period.

NOTE: Different PRATs may be declared for different configurations

In certain regions, the minimum requirement for normal conditions may
apply also for some conditions outside the ranges defined for the Normal
test environment in Annex D of TS 36.141 \[3\].

Two power classes are defined for relay access link and single power
class is defined for relay backhaul link, where the rated output power,
PRAT, shall be as specified in Table 6.2.1-2 and Table 6.2.1-3.

In certain regions, the minimum requirement for normal conditions may
apply also for some conditions outside the range of conditions defined
as normal.

For the backhaul link the minimum test requirements of Power Class 1 in
Table 6.2.5-1 shall apply.

### 6.2.6 Configured transmitted Power for backhaul link

The Relay backhaul link is allowed to set its configured maximum output
power P~CMAX~. The configured maximum output power P~CMAX~ is set within
the following bounds:

\- P~CMAX~ = MIN { P~EMAX~, PRAT }.

\- P~EMAX~ is the value given to IE *P-Max*, defined in TS 36.331.

\- PRAT is the Relay rated output power specified in Table 6.2.1-2 and
Table 6.2.1-3 without taking into account the tolerance specified in the
Table 6.2.2.1-1 of TS 36.116 \[2\].

. The minimum requirement is defined in TS 36.116 \[2\], clause 6.2.2.1.

The requirements for method of test for the relay backhaul link maximum
output power shall be the same as in clause 6.2.5 of TS 36.521 \[7\]
except that the requirements shall apply to relay nodes and the
reference measurement channel for R-PDCCH defined in Annex B of
TS 36.116 \[2\] shall apply for R-PDCCH .

For backhaul link test the configuration of OFDM symbols for eNB-to-RN
transmission in the first slot shall be as specified in Table 5.4-1 in
TS 36.216. Furthermore the reference measurement channel for R-PDCCH
defined in Annex B of TS 36.116 \[2\] shall apply.

#### 6.3.2.1 Minimum Output Power

##### 6.3.2.1.1 Test purpose

To verify the relay nodes ability to transmit with a broadband output
power below the value specified in the test requirement when the power
is set to a minimum value.

##### 6.3.2.1.2 Test applicability

This test applies to all types of E-UTRA relay nodes.

##### 6.3.2.1.3 Minimum conformance requirements

For a Relay backhaul link with one antenna connector the minimum output
power shall not exceed -50 dBm.

For a relay backhaul link with multiple transmit antenna connectors, the
minimum output power level is defined with respect to the sum of the
mean power at each relay node backhaul antenna connector in one
sub-frame (1 ms). The sum of these mean powers will be subject to the
-50 dBm minimum output power requirement.

The minimum output power is defined as the mean power in one sub-frame
(1ms). The minimum output power shall not exceed the values specified in
Table 6.3.2.3-1.

6.4 Transmitted signal quality
------------------------------

### 6.4.1 Frequency error

#### 6.4.1.1 Definition and applicability

Frequency error is the measure of the difference between the actual
relay transmit frequency and the assigned frequency. The same source
shall be used for RF frequency and data clock generation.

It is not possible to verify by testing that the data clock is derived
from the same frequency source as used for RF generation. This may be
confirmed by the manufacturer\'s declaration.

#### 6.4.1.2 Minimum Requirement

The minimum requirement is in TS 36.116 \[2\], clause 6.4.1.1.

#### 6.4.1.3 Test purpose

To verify that the Frequency Error is within the limits of the minimum
requirement.

#### 6.4.1.4 Method of test

For the relay access link, the frequency error requirement is tested
together with the Error Vector Magnitude test, as described in clause
6.5.2 of TS 36.141 \[3\] except that the requirements apply to relay
nodes.

For the relay backhaul link, the frequency error test method shall be
the same as in clause 6.5.1.4 of TS 36.521 \[7\] except that the
requirements shall apply to relay nodes.

#### 6.4.1.5 Test requirement 

For the relay access link, the modulated carrier frequency of each
E-UTRA carrier configured by the relay shall be accurate to within an
accuracy of ± (0.1 ppm + 12 Hz) observed over a period of one subframe
(1ms).

For the relay backhaul link the frequency error Δf results must fulfill
the test requirement: \|Δf\| ≤ (0.1 PPM + 15 Hz)

NOTE: If the above Test Requirement differs from the Minimum Requirement
then the Test Tolerance applied for this test is non-zero. The Test
Tolerance for this test and the explanation of how the Minimum
Requirement has been relaxed by the Test Tolerance are given in Annex G
of TS 36.141 \[3\] and in Annex F of TS36.521-1 \[7\].

### 6.4.2 EVM

The EVM test requirements for the relay access link shall be the same as
in clause 6.5.2 of TS 36.141 \[3\] except that the requirements apply to
relay nodes.

The EVM test requirements for the relay backhaul link shall be the same
as in clause 6.5.2 of TS 36.521 \[7\] except that the requirements apply
to relay nodes

### 6.4.3 Time alignment error

The test requirements for time alignment error for the relay access link
shall be the same as in clause 6.5.3 of TS 36.141 \[3\] except that the
requirements apply to relay nodes.

The test requirements time alignment error for the relay backhaul link
shall be the same as in clause 6.8 of TS 36.521 \[7\] except that the
requirements apply to relay nodes

### 6.4.4 DL RS power

The DL RS power test requirements for the relay access link shall be the
same as in clause 6.5.4 of TS 36.141 \[3\] except that the requirements
apply to relay nodes.

6.5 Unwanted emissions
----------------------

Unwanted emissions consist of out-of-band emissions and spurious
emissions \[4\]. Out of band emissions are unwanted emissions
immediately outside the channel bandwidth resulting from the modulation
process and non-linearity in the transmitter but excluding spurious
emissions. Spurious emissions are emissions which are caused by unwanted
transmitter effects such as harmonics emission, parasitic emission,
intermodulation products and frequency conversion products, but exclude
out of band emissions.

The out-of-band emissions requirement for the BS transmitter is
specified in terms of an Operating band unwanted emissions requirement
that defines limits for emissions in the downlink operating band plus
the frequency ranges 10 MHz above and 10 MHz below the band. Emissions
outside of this frequency range are limited by a spurious emissions
requirement.

### 6.5.1 Transmitter spurious emissions

The access link and backhaul link minimum requirement for transmitter
spurious emissions is defined in TS 36.116 \[2\] clause 6.5.1.

The method of test for transmitter spurious emissions for the relay
access link shall be the same as in clause 6.6.4 of TS 36.141 \[3\]
except that the requirements apply to relay nodes.

The method of test for transmitter spurious emissions for the relay
backhaul link shall be the same as in clause 6.6.3.1 of TS 36.521 \[7\]
except that the requirements apply to relay nodes.

For the test requirements, the local area requirements of clause 6.6.4.5
of TS 36.141 \[3\] shall apply for both access link and backhaul link.

### 6.5.2 Adjacent Channel Leakage power Ratio (ACLR)

The access link and backhaul link minimum requirement ACLR is defined in
TS 36.116 \[2\] clause 6.5.2.

The adjacent channel leakage power ratio (ACLR) method of test for the
relay access link shall be the same as in clause 6.6.2 of TS 36.141
\[3\] except that the requirements apply to relay nodes.

The adjacent channel leakage power ratio (ACLR) method of test for the
relay backhaul link shall be the same as in clause 6.6.2.3 of TS 36.521
\[7\] except that the requirements apply to relay nodes.

The test requirements for ACLR for both access link and backhaul link is
defined in clause 6.6.2.5 of TS 36.141\[3\].

### 6.5.3 Operating Bands Unwanted Emissions

#### 6.5.3.1 Definition and applicability

Unless otherwise stated, the Operating band unwanted emission limits are
defined from 10 MHz below the lowest frequency of the downlink operating
band up to 10 MHz above the highest frequency of the downlink operating
band (see Table 5.5-1 of TS 36.141 \[3\]).

The unwanted emission limits in the part of the downlink operating band
that falls in the spurious domain are consistent with ITU-R
Recommendation SM.329 \[9\].

For the access link and backhaul link of relay nodes, the requirements
of clause 6.5.3.5 shall apply (Category A and B).

The application of either Category A or Category B limits shall be the
same as for Transmitter spurious emissions (Mandatory Requirements) in
clause 6.6.4.5 of TS 36.141 \[3\].

#### 6.5.3.2 Minimum Requirement

The minimum requirement shall be as defined in TS 36.116 \[2\] clause
6.5.3.

#### 6.5.3.3 Test purpose

This test measures the emissions of the relay access link and backhaul
link, close to the assigned channel bandwidth of the wanted signal,
while the corresponding transmitter is in operation.

#### 6.5.3.4 Method of test

The Operating bands unwanted emissions method of test for the relay
access link shall be the same as in clause 6.6.3.4 of TS 36.141 \[3\]
except that the requirements apply to relay nodes

The Operating bands unwanted emissions method of test for the relay
backhaul link shall be the same as in clause 6.6.2.1.4 of TS 36.521
\[7\] except that the requirements apply to relay nodes.

#### 6.5.3.5 Test Requirement

The measurement results shall not exceed the maximum levels specified in
the tables below, where:

\- ∆f is the separation between the channel edge frequency and the
nominal -3dB point of the measuring filter closest to the carrier
frequency.

\- f\_offset is the separation between the channel edge frequency and
the centre of the measuring filter.

\- f\_offset~max~ is the offset to the frequency 10 MHz outside the
downlink operating band.

\- ∆f~max~ is equal to f\_offset~max~ minus half of the bandwidth of the
measuring filter.

###### 9.8.1.1.4.2 Test procedure

1\. SS transmits PDSCH via R-PDCCH DCI format 2C for C\_RNTI to transmit
the DL RMC according to Table 9.8.1.1.3-1 and Table 9.8.1.1.3-2.The
details of R-PDCCH and PDSCH are specified in Table B.1.1.1-1 and R.3
FDD in Table C.2-1 respectively of TR 36.826 \[5\]. The SS sends
downlink MAC padding bits on the DL RMC.

2\. Set the parameters of the propagation condition, antenna
configuration, the correlation matrix and the SNR according to Table
9.8.1.1.5-1 as appropriate.

3\. Measure the Pm-dsg for a duration sufficient to achieve statistical
significance according to Annex G clause G.4 defined in TS 36.521-1
\[7\]. Count the number of NACKs, ACKs and statDTXs on the UL PUCCH
during each subtest interval. Pm-dsg is the ratio
(statDTX)/(NACK+ACK+statDTX). If Pm-dsg is less than the value specified
in table 9.8.1.1.5-1, pass the RN. Otherwise fail the RN.

#### 9.8.1.2 FDD R-PDCCH performance based on UE-specific reference signals transmitted on antenna port 7 with 4x2 antenna configuration

##### 9.8.1.2.1 Test purpose

This test verifies the demodulation performance of R-PDCCH when R-PDCCH
is based on UE-specific reference signals transmitted on antenna port 7
with 4x2 antenna configuration. With a given SNR, the average
probability of miss-detection of the Downlink Scheduling Grant for RN,
tested on R-PDCCH of the specified reference measurement channels in
B.1.1.1 of \[5\] remains below a given reference value.

##### 9.8.1.2.2 Test applicability

This test applies to all types of E-UTRA FDD relay node release 11 and
forward.

##### 9.8.1.2.3 Minimum conformance requirements

The receiver characteristics of the R-PDCCH are determined by the
probability of miss-detection of the relay Downlink Scheduling Grant
(Pm-dsg).

###### 9.8.1.2.4.2 Test procedure

1\. SS transmits PDSCH via R-PDCCH DCI format 2C for C\_RNTI to transmit
the DL RMC according to Table 9.8.1.2.3-2.The details of R-PDCCH and
PDSCH are specified in Table B1.1.1-1 of TR 36.826 \[5\] and R.4 FDD in
Table C.2-1respectively. The SS sends downlink MAC padding bits on the
DL RMC.

2\. Set the parameters of the propagation condition, antenna
configuration, the correlation matrix and the SNR according to Table
9.8.1.2.5-1 as appropriate.

3\. Measure the Pm-dsg for a duration sufficient to achieve statistical
significance according to Annex G clause G.4 defined in TS
36.521-1\[7\]. Count the number of NACKs, ACKs and statDTXs on the UL
PUCCH during each subtest interval. Pm-dsg is the ratio
(statDTX)/(NACK+ACK+statDTX). If Pm-dsg is less than the value specified
in table 9.8.1.2.5-1, pass the UE. Otherwise fail the UE. If Pm-dsg is
less than the value specified in table 9.8.1.2.5-1, pass the UE.
Otherwise fail the UE.

### 9.8.2 TDD

#### 9.8.2.1 TDD R-PDCCH performance based on UE-specific reference signals transmitted on antenna port 7 with 1x2 antenna configuration

##### 9.8.2.1.1 Test purpose

This test verifies the demodulation performance of R-PDCCH when R-PDCCH
is based on UE-specific reference signals transmitted on antenna port 7
with 1x2 antenna configuration. With a given SNR, the average
probability of miss-detection of the Downlink Scheduling Grant for RN,
tested on R-PDCCH of the specified reference measurement channels in
B.1.1.2 of TR 36.826 \[5\] remains below a given reference value.

##### 9.8.2.1.2 Test applicability

This test applies to all types of E-UTRA TDD relay node release 11 and
forward.

##### 9.8.2.1.3 Minimum conformance requirements

The receiver characteristics of the R-PDCCH are determined by the
probability of miss-detection of the relay Downlink Scheduling Grant
(Pm-dsg).

###### 9.8.2.1.4.2 Test procedure

1\. SS transmits PDSCH via R-PDCCH DCI format 2C for C\_RNTI to transmit
the DL RMC according to Table 9.8.2.1.3-1 and 9.8.2.1.3-2.The details of
R-PDCCH and PDSCH are specified in Table B1.1.2-1 of TR 36.826 \[5\] and
R.3 TDD in Table C.2-2 of TR 36.826 \[5\] respectively. The SS sends
downlink MAC padding bits on the DL RMC.

2\. Set the parameters of the propagation condition, antenna
configuration, the correlation matrix and the SNR according to Table
9.8.2.1.5-1 as appropriate.

3\. Measure the Pm-dsg for a duration sufficient to achieve statistical
significance according to Annex G clause G.4 defined in TS
36.521-1\[7\]. Count the number of NACKs, ACKs and statDTXs on the UL
PUCCH during each subtest interval. Pm-dsg is the ratio
(statDTX)/(NACK+ACK+statDTX). If Pm-dsg is less than the value specified
in table 9.8.2.1.5-1, pass the RN. Otherwise fail the RN.

#### 9.8.2.2 TDD R-PDCCH performance based on UE-specific reference signals transmitted on antenna port 7 with 4x2 antenna configuration

##### 9.8.2.2.1 Test purpose

This test verifies the demodulation performance of R-PDCCH when R-PDCCH
is based on UE-specific reference signals transmitted on antenna port 7
with 4x2 antenna configuration. With a given SNR, the average
probability of miss-detection of the Downlink Scheduling Grant for RN,
tested on R-PDCCH of the specified reference measurement channels in
B.1.1.2 remains below a given reference value.

##### 9.8.2.2.2 Test applicability

This test applies to all types of E-UTRA TDD relay node release 11 and
forward.

##### 9.8.2.2.3 Minimum conformance requirements

The receiver characteristics of the R-PDCCH are determined by the
probability of miss-detection of the relay Downlink Scheduling Grant
(Pm-dsg).

###### 9.8.2.2.4.2 Test procedure

1\. SS transmits PDSCH via R-PDCCH DCI format 2C for C\_RNTI to transmit
the DL RMC according to Table 9.8.2.2.2.3-1 and 9.8.2.2.3-2.The details
of R-PDCCH and PDSCH are specified in Table B1.1.2-1 of TR 36.826 \[5\]
and R.4 TDD in Table C.2-2 of TR 36.826 \[5\] respectively. The SS sends
downlink MAC padding bits on the DL RMC.

2\. Set the parameters of the propagation condition, antenna
configuration, the correlation matrix and the SNR according to Table
9.8.2.2.5-1 as appropriate.

3\. Measure the Pm-dsg for a duration sufficient to achieve statistical
significance according to Annex G clause G.4 defined in TS
36.521-1\[7\]. Count the number of NACKs, ACKs and statDTXs on the UL
PUCCH during each subtest interval. Pm-dsg is the ratio
(statDTX)/(NACK+ACK+statDTX). If Pm-dsg is less than the value specified
in table 9.8.2.2.5-1, pass the RN. Otherwise fail the RN

######## Annex A (normative): Propagation models for relay demodulation requirements

A.1 Propagation models for backhaul link
========================================

A.1.1 Delay Profiles
--------------------

Three representative delay profiles are selected corresponding to the
LOS and NLOS scenarios.

### A.1.1.1 LOS between eNB and relay

Table A.1.1-1 and Table A.1.1-2 show the delay profiles for the LOS
scenarios: one with strong dominant component and the other with medium
dominant component. Note that the first tap in both Table A.1.1-1 and
Table A.1.1-2 corresponds to the LOS component, it is therefore a
non-fading tap and the corresponding Doppler frequency is 0.

Table A.1.1-1: Delay Profile for LOS Scenario (strong dominant
component)

+-------------------------+----------------+
| Excess tap delay \[ns\] | Relative power |
|                         |                |
|                         | \[dB\]         |
+-------------------------+----------------+
| 0                       | 0.0            |
+-------------------------+----------------+
| 30                      | -21.0          |
+-------------------------+----------------+
| 70                      | -22.0          |
+-------------------------+----------------+
| 90                      | -23.0          |
+-------------------------+----------------+

Note that as the first tap is at least 21dB stronger than the rest taps,
this channel may be considered as an AWGN channel. The exact one-tap
static AWGN channel model is FFS.

Table A.1.1-2: Delay Profile for LOS Scenario (medium dominant
component)

+-------------------------+----------------+
| Excess tap delay \[ns\] | Relative power |
|                         |                |
|                         | \[dB\]         |
+-------------------------+----------------+
| 0                       | 0.0            |
+-------------------------+----------------+
| 30                      | -11.0          |
+-------------------------+----------------+
| 70                      | -12.0          |
+-------------------------+----------------+
| 90                      | -13.0          |
+-------------------------+----------------+
| 110                     | -18.0          |
+-------------------------+----------------+
| 190                     | -27.2          |
+-------------------------+----------------+
| \[410\]                 | \[-30.8\]      |
+-------------------------+----------------+

Note that as the first tap is at least 11dB stronger than the rest taps,
this channel may be characterized by one dominant path combined with
significant scattering paths.

### A.1.1.2 NLOS between eNB and relay

For NLOS scenario, the delay profile is given in Table A.1.1-3.

Table A.1.1-3: Delay Profile for NLOS Scenario

+-------------------------+----------------+
| Excess tap delay \[ns\] | Relative power |
|                         |                |
|                         | \[dB\]         |
+-------------------------+----------------+
| 0                       | 0.0            |
+-------------------------+----------------+
| 30                      | -1.0           |
+-------------------------+----------------+
| 70                      | -2.0           |
+-------------------------+----------------+
| 90                      | -3.0           |
+-------------------------+----------------+
| 110                     | -8.0           |
+-------------------------+----------------+
| 190                     | -17.2          |
+-------------------------+----------------+
| 410                     | -20.8          |
+-------------------------+----------------+

A.1.2 Doppler Frequency
-----------------------

For NLOS between the eNB and the relay, as the relay nodes are often
fixed, hence a low Doppler frequency of 2Hz is used. Note that this 2 Hz
Doppler frequency is only used for the new channels (such as R-PDCCH).

A.1.3 MIMO Correlation Matrices
-------------------------------

For LOS component between the eNB and the relay, the spatial channel
correlation matrix is modeled as an all one matrix unless
cross-polarized antennas are deployed. This is because the correlation
matrix for the channel with single LOS component is of rank 1.

For NLOS scenario, the correlation matrices are given in the following
tables.

Table A.1.3-1 defines the correlation matrices for the eNB:

  ------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ ------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------

The values of *α* and *β* for different correlation types are given in
Table A.1.3-3.

  ----------------- -------------------- ------------------ ----- ----- -----

For the channel from the eNB to the relay, the channel spatial
correlation matrix ![](media/image21.wmf){width="0.3013888888888889in"
height="0.2361111111111111in"} is then given as the Kronecker product of
the eNB correlation matrix and the relay correlation matrix, i.e.
![](media/image22.wmf){width="1.2069444444444444in"
height="0.2361111111111111in"}.

A.2 multipath propagation fading conditions for access link
===========================================================

Tables A.2-1 to Table A.2-3 show multi-path delay profiles that are used
for the performance measurements in multi-path fading environment. All
taps have classical Doppler spectrum, defined as:

(CLASS) ![](media/image23.wmf){width="1.773611111111111in"
height="0.25416666666666665in"} for *f* ∈ -*fD*, *fD*.

A multipath fading propagation condition is defined by a combination of
a multi-path delay profile and a maximum Doppler frequency *f~D~* which
is either 5, 70 or 300 Hz.

Note that the ETU model shown in Table A.2-3 and Doppler frequency of
300Hz are optional for relay access link demodulation requirments.

The relay access link demodulation requirements are the same or subset
of the eNB requirements as described in TS 36.104.

B.2 OCNG patterns for R-PDCCH performance requirements
======================================================

The following OCNG patterns are used for modelling allocations to
virtual UEs (which are not under test) and/or allocations used for
MBSFN. The OCNG pattern for each sub frame specifies the allocations
that shall be filled with OCNG, and furthermore, the relative power
level of each such allocation.

In each test case the OCNG is expressed by parameters OCNG\_RA and
OCNG\_RB which together with a relative power level
(![](media/image24.wmf){width="0.14166666666666666in"
height="0.17847222222222223in"}) specifies the PDSCH EPRE-to-RS EPRE
ratios in OFDM symbols with and without reference symbols, respectively.
The relative power, which is used for modelling boosting per virtual UE
allocation, is expressed by:

![](media/image25.wmf){width="4.272916666666666in"
height="0.25416666666666665in"}

where ![](media/image26.wmf){width="0.1701388888888889in"
height="0.25416666666666665in"} denotes the relative power level of the
i:th virtual UE. The parameter settings of OCNG\_RA, OCNG\_RB, and the
set of relative power levels
![](media/image27.wmf){width="0.14166666666666666in"
height="0.17847222222222223in"}are chosen such that when also taking
allocations to the UE under test into account, as given by a PDSCH
reference channel, a constant transmitted power spectral density that is
constant on an OFDM symbol basis is targeted.

Moreover the OCNG pattern is accompanied by a PCFICH/PDCCH/PHICH
reference channel which specifies the control region. For any
aggregation and PHICH allocation, the PDCCH and any unused PHICH groups
are padded with resource element groups with a power level given
respectively by PDCCH\_RA/RB and PHICH\_RA/RB as specified in the test
case such that a total power spectral density in the control region that
is constant on an OFDM symbol basis is targeted.

B.2.1 FDD

### B.2.1.1 OCNG FDD pattern 1for R-PDCCH

This OCNG Pattern fills with OCNG all empty PRB-s (PRB-s with no
allocation of data or system information) of the DL sub-frames, when the
unallocated area is discontinuous (divided in two parts by the allocated
area -- two sided) or continuous (one sided) in the frequency domain,
starts with PRB 0 and ends with PRB *N~RB~*-1.

### B.2.2.1 OCNG TDD pattern 1for R-PDCCH

This OCNG Pattern fills with OCNG all empty PRB-s (PRB-s with no
allocation of data or system information) of the subframes available for
DL transmission (depending on TDD UL/DL configuration), when the
unallocated area is discontinuous (divided in two parts by the allocated
area -- two sided) or continuous (one sided) in the frequency domain,
starts with PRB 0 and ends with PRB *N~RB~* -1.

######## Annex C (normative): Physical Channel Set-up for conformance tests

C.1 Set-up for R-PDCCH
======================

Table C.1-1 is applicable for demodulation performance requirements in
which uniform RS-to-EPRE boosting for R-PDCCH.

Table C.1-1: Downlink Physical Channels transmitted during a connection
(FDD and TDD)

  ------------------ -------------------- ------
  Physical Channel   EPRE Ratio           Note
  R-PDCCH            R-PDCCH\_RA = ρ~A~   
                     R-PDCCH\_RB = ρ~B~   
  PDSCH              PDSCH\_RA = ρ~A~     
                     PDSCH\_RB = ρ~B~     
  ------------------ -------------------- ------

NOTE 1: ρ~A~= ρ~B~ = 0 dB means no RS boosting.

NOTE 2: ρ~A~ denotes the ratio of PDSCH EPRE to cell-specific RS EPRE
among PDSCH REs in all the OFDM symbols not containing cell-specific RS.
ρ~B~ denotes the ratio of PDSCH EPRE to cell-specific RS EPRE among
PDSCH REs in all the OFDM symbols containing cell-specific RS.

The power allocation for OFDM symbols and reference signals is the same
as defined in Annex C.3.2 in TS 36.521-1 \[7\].

The PDCCH aggregation level for R-PDCCH demodulation tests is 8 CCE-s.
