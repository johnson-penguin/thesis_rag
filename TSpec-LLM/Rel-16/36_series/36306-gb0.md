========================================

3.1 Definitions
---------------

For the purposes of the present document, the terms and definitions
given in TR 21.905 \[1\] and the following apply. A term defined in the
present document takes precedence over the definition of the same term,
if any, in TR 21.905 \[1\].

**Fallback band combination:** A band combination that would result from
another band combination (parent band combination) by releasing at least
one SCell or uplink configuration of SCell. A fallback band combination
supports the same channel bandwidths for each carrier as its parent band
combination. An intra-band non-contiguous band combination is not
considered to be a fallback band combination of an intra-band contiguous
band combination.

**NB-IoT:** NB-IoT allows access to network services via E-UTRA with a
channel bandwidth limited to 200 kHz (corresponding to one PRB).

**Primary Cell:** The cell, operating on the primary frequency, in which
the UE either performs the initial connection establishment procedure or
initiates the connection re-establishment procedure, or the cell
indicated as the primary cell in the handover procedure. In this
specification, Primary Cell also refers to PSCell defined in TS 36.331
\[5\] unless explicitly stated otherwise.

**Sidelink**: UE to UE interface for sidelink communication, V2X
sidelink communication and sidelink discovery. The Sidelink corresponds
to the PC5 interface as defined in TS 23.303 \[24\].

**Sidelink communication**: AS functionality enabling ProSe Direct
Communication as defined in TS 23.303 \[24\], between two or more nearby
UEs, using E-UTRA technology but not traversing any network node. In
this version, the terminology \"sidelink communication\" without \"V2X\"
prefix only concerns PS unless specifically stated otherwise.

**Sidelink discovery**: AS functionality enabling ProSe Direct Discovery
as defined in TS 23.303 \[24\], using E-UTRA technology but not
traversing any network node.

**V2X sidelink communication**: AS functionality enabling V2X
Communication as defined in TS 23.285 \[29\], between nearby UEs, using
E-UTRA technology but not traversing any network node.

4 UE radio access capability parameters
=======================================

The following clauses define the UE radio access capability parameters
and minimum capabilities for MBMS capable UE. Only parameters for which
there is the possibility for UEs to signal different values are
considered as UE radio access capability parameters. Therefore,
mandatory features without capability parameters that are the same for
all UEs are not listed here. Also capabilities which are optional or
conditionally mandatory for UEs to implement but do not have UE radio
access capability parameter are listed in this specification.

E-UTRAN needs to respect the signalled UE radio access capability
parameters when configuring the UE and when scheduling the UE.

All parameters shown in italics are signalled and correspond to a field
defined in TS 36.331 \[5\].

For optional features, the UE radio access capability parameter
indicates whether the feature has been implemented and successfully
tested. For mandatory features with the UE radio access capability
parameter, the parameter indicates whether the feature has been
successfully tested.

The mandatory features required to be supported by a UE are the same for
all UE categories unless explicitly specified elsewhere in the
specifications.

Unless otherwise stated, the requirements on the maximum number of
transport block bits are applicable for a TTI length of 1 ms. For other
TTI lengths, the requirements shall be scaled according to clause 7.1.7
or 11.1 in TS 36.213 \[22\] in order to get the corresponding
requirement.

4.1A *ue-CategoryDL* and *ue-CategoryUL*
----------------------------------------

The fields *ue-CategoryDL* and *ue-CategoryUL* define downlink/uplink
capability respectively. The parameters set by the UE DL/UL Categories
are defined in clause 4.2. Tables 4.1A-1 and 4.1A-2 define the downlink
and, respectively, uplink physical layer parameter values for each UE
DL/UL Category. Table 4.1A-4 defines the minimum capability for the
maximum number of bits of a MCH transport block received within a TTI
for an MBMS capable UE capable of reception via MBSFN. Table 4.1A-6
defines the only combinations for UE UL and DL Categories that are
allowed to be signalled with *ue-CategoryDL* and *ue-CategoryUL. Table
4.1A-6 also defines which UE Categories a UE shall indicate in addition
to the* combinations for UE UL and DL Categories*.* For a BL UE, Table
4.1A-7 defines the only combinations for UE UL and DL Categories that
are allowed to be signalled with *ue-CategoryDL* and *ue-CategoryUL*,
and which UE Categories a UE shall indicate in addition to the
combinations for UE UL and DL Categories. A UE indicating DL category 13
may indicate category 9 or 10 in *ue-Category-v1170*. A UE indicating
Category M2 shall also indicate Category M1.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

The ue-CategorySL-C-RX, ue-CategorySL-C-TX and ue-CategorySL-D define
reception and transmission capabilities for sidelink communication, V2X
sidelink communication and sidelink discovery respectively. The
parameters set by the UE SL-C-RX, UE SL-C-TX (sidelink communication and
V2X sidelink communication) category and UE SL-D (sidelink discovery)
category are defined in clause 4.2A. Table 4.1B-1 and Table 4.1B-2
defines the reception and transmission physical layer parameter values
for each SL-C-RX and each SL-C-TX Category, respectively. Table 4.1B-3
defines physical layer parameter values for each SL-D Category. If a UE
of this release supports sidelink communication, the UE shall support
SL-C-RX Category 1 and SL-C-TX Category 1. If a UE of this release
supports V2X sidelink communication, the UE shall support SL-C-RX
Category 2 to 4 for reception, and SL-C-TX category 2 to 5 for
transmission. If a UE of this release supports sidelink discovery, the
UE shall support SL-D Category 1.

configurations with inter-band, intra-band non-contiguous, intra-band
contiguous carrier aggregation and without carrier aggregation. For each
band in a band combination the UE provides the supported CA bandwidth
classes and the corresponding MIMO capabilities for downlink. The UE
also has to provide the supported uplink CA bandwidth class and the
corresponding MIMO capability for at least one band in the band
combination. Applicability of provisioning uplink CA bandwidth class for
each band in the band combinations is defined in TS 36.101 \[6\]. A MIMO
capability applies to all carriers of a bandwidth class of a band in a
band combination. For bandwidth classes that include multiple component
carriers (i.e. bandwidth classes B, C, D and so on), the UE may also
indicate a separate MIMO capability that applies to each individual
carrier of a bandwidth class of a band in a band combination.

In all non-CA band combinations the UE shall indicate a bandwidth class
supporting the maximum channel bandwidth defined for the band.

In all non-CA band combinations the UE shall indicate at least the
number of layers for spatial multiplexing according to the UE\'s Rel-8/9
category (Cat. 1-5). If the UE provides a Rel-10 category (Cat. 6-8) it
shall indicate at least the number of layers according to that category
for at least one band combination. In all other band combinations a UE
indicating a category 2 and higher shall indicate support for at least 2
layers for downlink spatial multiplexing for all bands. The indicated
number of layers for spatial multiplexing may exceed the number of
layers required according to the category indicated by the UE. The
carrier aggregation and MIMO capabilities indicated for at least one
band combination together with modulation scheme shall meet the
processing requirements defined by the physical layer parameter values
in the UE category (i.e., maximum number of DL-SCH/UL-SCH transport
block bits received/transmitted within a TTI, maximum number of bits of
a DL-SCH/UL-SCH transport block received/transmitted within a TTI, and
total number of soft channel bits for downlink).

NOTE: If the UE reports a subset of supported band combinations based on
*requestedFrequencyBands* and/or *skipFallbackCombinations* and/or
*maximumCCsRetrieval,* reported band combination(s) may or may not meet
the processing requirements defined by the physical layer parameter
values in the UE category.

The UE that supports MBMS reception via MBSFN shall support MBMS
reception via MBSFN on the PCell of MCG, and it may indicate support for
MBMS reception via MBSFN on configured SCells (*mbms-SCell*) and for any
cell that may be additionally configured as an SCell
(*mbms-NonServingCell*) according to this field. The UE may indicate
support for MBMS reception from FeMBMS/Unicast mixed cells
(*fembmsMixedCell*) or MBMS-dedicated cells (*fembmsDedicatedCell*). The
UE that supports MBMS reception via SC-PTM shall support MBMS reception

reception via SC-PTM on configured SCells (*scptm-SCell*) and for any
cell that may be additionally configured as an SCell
(*scptm-NonServingCell*) according to this field. The UE shall apply the
system information acquisition and change monitoring procedure relevant
for MBMS operation for these cells.

The UE indicating more than one frequency in the
*MBMSInterestIndication* message as specified in TS 36.331 \[5\] shall
support simultaneous reception of MBMS (via MBSFN or SC-PTM) on the
indicated frequencies when the frequencies of the configured serving
cells and the indicated frequencies belong to at least one band
combination.

NOTE: For the purposes of determining whether the carrier aggregation
and MIMO capabilities indicated for a band combination meets the
processing requirements defined by the physical layer parameter values
in the UE category as described above, the carrier aggregation and MIMO
capabilities indicated for a band combination is considered to meet the
processing requirements if the UE supports the maximum processing
requirements defined by the UE category assuming 20MHz channel bandwidth
is supported on all bands.

While PCell is not changed, the UE shall support release of any SCell(s)
or any uplink configuration of SCell(s) without requiring
reconfiguration of parameters related to UE radio access capabilities
for the remaining serving cell(s) in the fallback band combination,
except for release of an SCell from a contiguous CA band configuration
that results in a non-contiguous CA band configuration.

supports different combinations of the corresponding sTTI/sPT
capabilities.

with configured uplink as specified in TS 36.321 \[4\].

If the fallback band combinations for a given band combination are
omitted in this field (see TS 36.331 \[5\]), the UE shall for all the
omitted fallback band combinations support the same UE radio access
capabilities as for the parent band combination.

NOTE: A fallback band combination may have multiple different parent
band combinations.

While reporting the sTTI/sPT capabilities, the UE is allowed to report

########  Annex A (informative): Guideline on maximum number of DL PDCP SDUs per TTI

In order to help the dimensioning of the UE design, values for the
maximum number of DL PDCP SDUs per TTI from Table A-1 may be used. The
values are applicable for a TTI length of 1 ms. For other TTI lengths,
the table refers to maximum number of DL PDCP SDUs within a 1ms period.

NOTE: Due to the need for the network buffer data for efficient
scheduling, values for Category 1, 1bis and 2 are same. It is not
expected that category 1 or category 1bis UE has to sustain the same
rate of PDCP SDUs per TTI as category 2 for prolonged period of time.
