4 Control of UE/E-UTRAN measurements
====================================

In this chapter the general measurement control concept of the higher
layers is briefly described to provide an understanding on how L1
measurements are initiated and controlled by higher layers.

With the measurement specifications L1 provides measurement capabilities
for the UE and E-UTRAN. These measurements can be classified in
different reported measurement types: intra-frequency, inter-frequency,
inter-system, traffic volume, quality and UE internal measurements (see
the RRC Protocol \[7\]).

In the L1 measurement definitions, see chapter 5, the measurements are
categorised as measurements in the UE (the messages for these will be
described in the MAC Protocol \[6\] or RRC Protocol \[7\] or LPP
Protocol \[11\]) or measurements in the E-UTRAN (the messages for these
will be described in the Frame Protocol or LPPa Protocol \[12\]).

To initiate a specific measurement, the E-UTRAN transmits a \'RRC
connection reconfiguration message\' to the UE including a measurement
ID and type, a command (setup, modify, release), the measurement
objects, the measurement quantity, the reporting quantities and the
reporting criteria (periodical/event-triggered), see \[7\] or E-SMLC
transmits an \'LPP Request Location Information message\' to UE, see
\[11\].

When the reporting criteria are fulfilled the UE shall answer with a
\'measurement report message\' to the E-UTRAN including the measurement
ID and the results or an \'LPP Provide Location Information message\' to
the E-SMLC, see \[11\].

For idle mode, the measurement information elements are broadcast in the
System Information.

5 Measurement capabilities for E-UTRA

In this chapter the physical layer measurements reported to higher
layers are defined.

### 5.1.1 Reference Signal Received Power (RSRP)

+--------------------+------------------------------------------------+
| **Definition**     | Reference signal received power (RSRP), is     |
|                    | defined as the linear average over the power   |
|                    | contributions (in \[W\]) of the resource       |
|                    | elements that carry cell-specific reference    |
|                    | signals within the considered measurement      |
|                    | frequency bandwidth.                           |
|                    |                                                |
|                    | For RSRP determination the cell-specific       |
|                    | reference signals R~0~ according to TS 36.211  |
|                    | \[3\] shall be used. If the UE can reliably    |
|                    | detect that R~1~ is available, it may use R~1~ |
|                    | in addition to R~0~ to determine RSRP.         |
|                    |                                                |
|                    | If higher layers indicate measurements based   |
|                    | on discovery signals, the UE shall measure     |
|                    | RSRP in the subframes in the configured        |
|                    | discovery signal occasions. For frame          |
|                    | structure 1 and 2, if the UE can reliably      |
|                    | detect that cell-specific reference signals    |
|                    | are present in other subframes, the UE may use |
|                    | those subframes in addition to determine RSRP. |
|                    |                                                |
|                    | If higher layers indicate measurements based   |
|                    | on resynchronization signals (RSS), the UE     |
|                    | shall measure RSRP on the resynchronization    |
|                    | signal in the subframes in the configured      |
|                    | resynchronization signal occasions.            |
|                    |                                                |
|                    | The reference point for the RSRP shall be the  |
|                    | antenna connector of the UE.                   |
|                    |                                                |
|                    | If receiver diversity is in use by the UE, the |
|                    | reported value shall not be lower than the     |
|                    | corresponding RSRP of any of the individual    |
|                    | diversity branches.                            |
+--------------------+------------------------------------------------+
| **Applicable for** | RRC\_IDLE intra-frequency,                     |
|                    |                                                |
|                    | RRC\_IDLE inter-frequency,                     |
|                    |                                                |
|                    | RRC\_CONNECTED intra-frequency,                |
|                    |                                                |
|                    | RRC\_CONNECTED inter-frequency                 |
+--------------------+------------------------------------------------+

NOTE 1: The number of resource elements within the considered
measurement frequency bandwidth and within the measurement period that
are used by the UE to determine RSRP is left up to the UE implementation
with the limitation that corresponding measurement accuracy requirements
have to be fulfilled.

NOTE 2: The power per resource element is determined from the energy
received during the useful part of the symbol, excluding the CP.

### 5.1.3 Reference Signal Received Quality (RSRQ) 

+--------------------+------------------------------------------------+
| **Definition**     | Reference Signal Received Quality (RSRQ) is    |
|                    | defined as the ratio *N*×RSRP/(E-UTRA carrier  |
|                    | RSSI), where *N* is the number of RB\'s of the |
|                    | E-UTRA carrier RSSI measurement bandwidth. The |
|                    | measurements in the numerator and denominator  |
|                    | shall be made over the same set of resource    |
|                    | blocks.                                        |
|                    |                                                |

|                    | Indicator (RSSI), comprises the linear average |
|                    | of the total received power (in \[W\])         |
|                    | observed only in certain OFDM symbols of       |
|                    | measurement subframes, in the measurement      |
|                    | bandwidth, over *N* number of resource blocks  |
|                    | by the UE from all sources, including          |
|                    | co-channel serving and non-serving cells,      |

### 5.1.31 Channel occupancy ratio (CR)

+--------------------+------------------------------------------------+
| **Definition**     | Channel occupancy ratio (CR) evaluated at      |
|                    | subframe *n* is defined as the total number of |

+--------------------+------------------------------------------------+

NOTE 1: *a* is a positive integer and *b* is 0 or a positive integer;
*a* and *b* are determined by UE implementation with *a+b+1 = 1000*, a
\>= 500, and n+b should not exceed the last transmission opportunity of
the grant for the current transmission.

NOTE 2: CR is evaluated for each (re)transmission.

NOTE 3: In evaluating CR, the UE shall assume the transmission parameter
used at subframe *n* is reused according to the existing grant(s) in
subframes \[*n+1*, *n+b*\] without packet dropping.

NOTE 4: The subframe index is based on physical subframe index.

NOTE 5: CR can be computed per priority level

+--------------------+------------------------------------------------+
| **Definition**     | NR SS reference signal received power          |
|                    | (NR-SS-RSRP) is defined as the linear average  |
|                    | over the power contributions (in \[W\]) of the |
|                    | resource elements that carry secondary         |
|                    | synchronization signals (SS). The measurement  |
|                    | time resource(s) for NR-SS-RSRP are confined   |
|                    | within SS/PBCH Block Measurement Time          |
|                    | Configuration (SMTC) window duration.          |

|                    | reference signals for physical broadcast       |
|                    | channel (PBCH) in addition to secondary        |
|                    | synchronization signals may be used.           |
|                    | NR-SS-RSRP using demodulation reference signal |
|                    | for PBCH shall be measured by linear averaging |
|                    | over the power contributions of the resource   |
|                    | elements that carry corresponding reference    |
|                    | signals taking into account power scaling for  |
|                    | the reference signals as defined in TS 38.213  |

|                    | NR-SS-RSRP shall be measured only among the    |
|                    | reference signals corresponding to SS/PBCH     |
|                    | blocks with the same SS/PBCH block index and   |
|                    | the same physical-layer cell identity.         |
|                    |                                                |
|                    | If higher-layers indicate certain SS/PBCH      |
|                    | blocks for performing NR-SS-RSRP measurements, |
|                    | then NR-SS-RSRP is measured only from the      |
|                    | indicated set of SS/PBCH block(s).             |
|                    |                                                |
|                    | For frequency range 1, the reference point for |
|                    | the NR-SS-RSRP shall be the antenna connector  |
|                    | of the UE. For frequency range 2, NR-SS-RSRP   |
|                    | shall be measured based on the combined signal |
|                    | from antenna elements corresponding to a given |
|                    | receiver branch. For frequency range 1 and 2,  |
|                    | if receiver diversity is in use by the UE, the |
|                    | reported NR-SS-RSRP value shall not be lower   |
|                    | than the corresponding NR-SS-RSRP of any of    |
|                    | the individual receiver branches.              |
+--------------------+------------------------------------------------+
| **Applicable for** | RRC\_IDLE inter-RAT,                           |

|                    | RRC\_CONNECTED inter-RAT                       |
+--------------------+------------------------------------------------+

NOTE 1: The number of resource elements within the measurement period
that are used by the UE to determine NR-SS-RSRP is left up to the UE
implementation with the limitation that corresponding measurement
accuracy requirements have to be fulfilled.

NOTE 2: The power per resource element is determined from the energy
received during the useful part of the symbol, excluding the CP.

| **Definition**     | NR Secondary synchronization signal reference  |
|                    | signal received quality (NR-SS-RSRQ) is        |
|                    | defined as the ratio of N× NR-SS-RSRP / NR     |
|                    | carrier RSSI, where N is the number of         |
|                    | resource blocks in the NR carrier RSSI         |
|                    | measurement bandwidth. The measurements in the |
