4 General assumptions
=====================

The present document discusses system scenarios for E-UTRA operation
primarily with respect to the radio transmission and reception including
the RRM aspects. To develop the E-UTRA standard, all the relevant
scenarios need to be considered for the various aspects of operation and
the most critical cases identified. The process may then be iterated to
arrive at final parameters that meet both service and implementation
requirements.

The E-UTRA system is intended to be operated in the same frequency bands
specified for UTRA. In order to limit the number of frequency bands to
be simulated in the various simulation scenarios a mapping of frequency
bands to two simulation frequencies (900 MHz and 2000 MHz) is applied.
When using the macro cell propagation model of TR25.942 \[3\], the
frequency contributes to the path loss by 21\*log10(f). The maximum path
loss difference between the lowest/highest frequencies per E-UTRA
frequency band and corresponding simulation frequency is shown in tables
4.1 and 4.2.

It can be observed that the difference of path loss between simulation
frequency and operating frequency (except bands 7, 11 and 38) is in the
worst case less than 0.8 dB for the downlink and less the 1,5 dB for the
uplink. Hence the mapping of operating frequency to simulation frequency
will provide valid results.

The validity of simulations performed at 2 GHz for the 2.6 GHz bands 7
and 38 was already analyzed in TR 25.810. Considering the expected
higher antenna gain in the 2.6 GHz band the difference in path loss is
in the order of 1 dB what is comparable to the other frequency bands.

4.3 Cell definitions
--------------------

This chapter contain the cell properties e.g. cell range, cell type
(omni, sector), MIMO cell definitions etc.

4.4 Cell layouts
----------------

This chapter contains different cell layouts in form of e.g. single
operator, multi-operator and multi layer cell layouts (e.g. macro-micro
etc).

### 4.4.1 Single operator cell layouts

#### 4.4.1.1 Macro cellular deployment

Base stations with 3 sectors per site are placed on a hexagonal grid
with distance of 3\*R, where R is the cell radius (see Figure 4.2), with
wrap around. The number of sites shall be equal to or higher than 19.
\[2\] \[4\].

### 4.4.2 Multi operator / Multi layer cell layouts

#### 4.4.2.1 Uncoordinated macro cellular deployment

For uncoordinated network simulations, identical cell layouts for each
network shall be applied, with worst case shift between sites. Second
network's sites are located at the first network's cell edge, as shown
in Figure 4.3 \[2\].

#### 4.4.2.2 Coordinated macro cellular deployment

For coordinated network simulations, co-location of sites is assumed;
hence identical cell layouts for each network shall be applied \[2\].

4.5 Propagation conditions and channel models
---------------------------------------------

This chapter contains the definition of channel models, propagation
conditions for various environments e.g. urban, suburban etc.

For each environment a propagation model is used to evaluate the
propagation pathloss due to the distance. Propagation models are adopted
from \[3\] and \[4\] and presented in the following clauses.

### 4.5.1 Received signal

An important parameter to be defined is the minimum coupling loss (MCL).
MCL is the parameter describing the minimum loss in signal between BS
and UE or UE and UE in the worst case and is defined as the minimum
distance loss including antenna gains measured between antenna
connectors. MCL values are adopted from \[3\] and \[7\] as follows:

Table 4.4: Minimum Coupling Losses

  ----------------------- ---------- -------
  Environment             Scenario   MCL
  Macro cell Urban Area   BS ↔ UE    70 dB
  Macro cell Rural Area   BS ↔ UE    80 dB
  ----------------------- ---------- -------

With the above definition, the received power in downlink and uplink can
be expressed as \[3\]:

RX\_PWR = TX\_PWR -- Max (pathloss -- G\_TX -- G\_RX, MCL)

where:

RX\_PWR is the received signal power

TX\_PWR is the transmitted signal power

G\_TX is the transmitter antenna gain

G\_RX is the receiver antenna gain

### 4.5.2 Macro cell propagation model -- Urban Area

Macro cell propagation model for urban area is applicable for scenarios
in urban and suburban areas outside the high rise core where the
buildings are of nearly uniform height \[3\]:

where:

R is the base station-UE separation in kilometres

f is the carrier frequency in MHz

Dhb is the base station antenna height in metres, measured from the
average rooftop level

Considering a carrier frequency of 900MHz and a base station antenna
height of 15 metres above average rooftop level, the propagation model
is given by the following formula \[4\]:

where:

R is the base station-UE separation in kilometres

Considering a carrier frequency of 2000MHz and a base station antenna
height of 15 metres above average rooftop level, the propagation model
is given by the following formula:

where:

R is the base station-UE separation in kilometres

After L is calculated, log-normally distributed shadowing (LogF) with
standard deviation of 10dB should be added \[2\], \[3\]. A Shadowing
correlation factor of 0.5 for the shadowing between sites (regardless
aggressing or victim system) and of 1 between sectors of the same site
shall be used The pathloss is given by the following formula:

NOTE 1: L shall in no circumstances be less than free space loss. This
model is valid for NLOS case only and describes worse case propagation

NOTE 2: The pathloss model is valid for a range of Dhb from 0 to 50
metres.

NOTE 3: This model is designed mainly for distance from few hundred
meters to kilometres. This model is not very accurate for short
distances.

NOTE 4: The mean building height is equal to the sum of mobile antenna
height (1,5m) and \[5\].

NOTE 5: Some downlink simulations in this TR were performed without
shadowing correlation, however it was reported this has a negligible
impact on the simulation results.

### 4.5.3 Macro cell propagation model -- Rural Area

For rural area, the Hata model was used in the work item UMTS900\[2\],
this model can be reused:

L (R)= 69.55
+26.16log~10~(f)--13.82log~10~(Hb)+\[44.9-6.55log~10~(Hb)\]log(R) --
4.78(Log~10~ (f))^2^+18.33 log~10~ (f) -40.94

where:

R is the base station-UE separation in kilometres

f is the carrier frequency in MHz

Hb is the base station antenna height above ground in metres

Considering a carrier frequency of 900MHz and a base station antenna
height of 45 meters above ground the propagation model is given by the
following formula:

where:

R is the base station-UE separation in kilometres

After L is calculated, log-normally distributed shadowing (LogF) with
standard deviation of 10dB should be added \[2\], \[3\]. A Shadowing
correlation factor of 0.5 for the shadowing between sites (regardless
aggressing or victim system) and of 1 between sectors of the same site
shall be used. The pathloss is given by the following formula:

NOTE 1: L shall in no circumstances be less than free space loss. This
model is valid for NLOS case only and describes worse case propagation

NOTE 2: This model is designed mainly for distance from few hundred
meters to kilometres. This model is not very accurate for short
distances.

5 Methodology description
=========================

This chapter describes the methods used for various study items e.g.
deterministic analysis for BS-BS interference, Monte-Carlo simulations
and dynamic type of simulations for RRM.

5.1 Methodology for co-existence simulations
--------------------------------------------

Simulations to investigate the mutual interference impact of E-UTRA,
UTRA and GERAN are based on snapshots were users are randomly placed in
a predefined deployment scenario (Monte-Carlo approach). Assumptions or
E-UTRA in this chapter are based on the physical layer (OFDMA DL and
SC-FDMA UL) as described in the E-UTRA study item report \[4\]. It must
be noted that actual E-UTRA physical layer specification of frequency
resource block is different regarding number of sub-carriers per
resource block (12 instead of 25 specified in \[4\]) and regarding the
size of a resource block (180 kHz instead of 375 kHz in \[4\]). However,
this has no impact on the results and conclusions of the present
document.

### 5.1.1 Simulation assumptions for co-existence simulations

#### 5.1.1.1 Scheduler

For initial E-UTRA coexistence simulations Round Robin scheduler shall
be used.

#### 5.1.1.2 Simulated services

When using Round Robin scheduler, full buffer traffic shall be
simulated. For E-UTRA downlink, one frequency resource block for one
user shall be used. The E-UTRA system shall be maximum loaded, i.e. 24
frequency resource blocks in 10 MHz bandwidth and 12 frequency resource
blocks in 5 MHz bandwidth respectively. For E-UTRA uplink, the number of
allocated frequency resource blocks for one user is 4 for 5 MHz
bandwidth and 8 for 10 MHz bandwidth respectively.

For the 5 MHz TDD UTRA victim using 3.84 Mcps TDD, Enhanced Uplink
providing data service shall be used where 1 UE shall occupy 1 Resource
Unit (code x timeslot). Here the number of UE per timeslot is set to 3
UEs/timeslot.

Other services, e.g. constant bit rate services are FFS.

#### 5.1.1.3 ACIR value and granularity

For downlink a common ACIR for all frequency resource blocks to
calculate inter-system shall be used. Frequency resource block specific
ACIR is FFS.

For uplink it is assumed that the ACIR is dominated by the UE ACLR. The
ACLR model is described in table 5.1 and table 5.2

Note: This ACLR models are agreed for the purpose of co-existence
simulations. ACLR/ACS requirements need to be discussed separately.

##### 5.1.1.4.1 Uplink Asymmetrical Bandwidths ACIR (Aggressor with larger bandwidth)

Since the uplink ACLR of the aggressor is measured in the aggressor's
bandwidth, for uplink asymmetrical bandwidth coexistence, a victim UE
with a smaller bandwidth than that of the aggressor will receive a
fraction of the interference power caused by the aggressor's ACLR. For
two victim UEs falling within the 1st ACLR of the aggressor, the victim
UE closer in frequency to the aggressor will experience higher
interference than one that is further away in frequency. The difference
in interference depends on the power spectral density (PSD) within the
aggressor's 1st ACLR bandwidth. For simplicity, it is assumed that the
PSD is flat across the aggressor's ACLR bandwidth. Hence, the ACLR can
be adjusted by the factor, F~ACLR~:

F~ACLR~ = 10 × LOG~10~(B~victim~/B~Aggressor~)

Where, B~Aggressor~ and B~Victim~ are the E-UTRA aggressor and victim
bandwidths respectively.

Figure 5.1: 20 MHz E-UTRA UE aggressor to 5 MHz E-UTRA UE victims

Figure 5.2: 20 MHz E-UTRA UE aggressor to 10 MHz E-UTRA UE victims

In Table 5.2, the aggressor UE that is non adjacent to the victim UE,
the victim UE will experience an interference due to an ACLR of 43 + X
-- F~ACLR~. For the case where the aggressor UE is adjacent to the
victim UEs, consider the scenarios in Figure 5.1, 5.2 and 5.3, where a
20 MHz E-UTRA aggressor is adjacent to 3 victim UEs of 5 MHz, 10 MHz and
15 MHz E-UTRA systems respectively.

In Figure 5.1, all the UEs in the 5 MHz E-UTRA system will be affected
by an ACLR of 30 + X - F~ACLR~. For the 10 MHz E-UTRA victims in Figure
5.2, two UEs will be affected by an ACLR of 30 + X - F~ACLR~ whilst 1 UE
will be affected by a less severe ACLR of 43 + X- F~ACLR~ . In the 15
MHz E-UTRA victim as shown in Figure 5.3, the UE next to the band edge
will be affected by an ACLR of 30 + X - F~ACLR~ whilst the UE farthest
from the band edge will be affected by an ACLR of 43 + X - F~ACLR~. The
victim UE of the 15 MHz E-UTRA occupying the centre RB (2nd from band
edge) is affected by 1/3 ACLR of 30 + X - F~ACLR~ and 2/3 ACLR of 43 + X
- F~ACLR~. This gives an ACLR of 34 + X - F~ACLR~.

Using a similar approach for 15 MHz, 10 MHz and 5 MHz aggressor with a
victim of smaller system bandwidth, the ACLR affecting each of the 3
victim UEs can be determined. This is summarised in Table 5.2A. Here the
value Y is defined for victim UE, where ACLR = Y + X - F~ACLR~. UE1 is
the UE adjacent to the aggressor, UE2 is located at the centre and UE3
is furthest away from the aggressor.

The victims in 10 MHz system under a 20 MHz aggressor experience
slightly worse interference than the victims in 15 MHz system under a 20
MHz aggressor and therefore, we only need to consider the worst of the
two cases. Hence, from Table 5.2A, the total number of asymmetrical
bandwidth coexistences can be reduced to 3 scenarios and they are
summarised in Table 5.2B. The performance of the other scenarios can be
derived from these 3 base scenarios by factoring in the FACLR factor in
the ACLR.

Table 5.2B: Base scenarios (F~ACLR~ = 0 dB)

  Scenario   System Bandwidth (MHz)   Value Y (dB), ACLR = Y + X               
  ---------- ------------------------ ---------------------------- ----- ----- -----
             Aggressor                Victim                       UE1   UE2   UE3
  1          15                       10                           30    32    43
  2          20                       10                           30    30    43
  3          20                       5                            30    30    30

An additional factor will be required to cater for the differences in UE
transmit powers, which are dependent upon the power control scheme used
in Table 5.3. Given the power control scheme, a UE with higher bandwidth
will transmit at higher overall power (note: max UE transmit power
remains the same). Thus, an aggressor with higher transmit power than
the aggressor in the base scenario needs to increase its ACLR. On the
other hand, for an interference limited environment, a victim with
higher transmit power can overcome higher level of interference and
hence demands a relaxed ACLR from its aggressor. The differences in
transmit powers are given in the power control factor, P~ACLR~ and it is
dependent upon the CLx-ile of the aggressors and victims. P~ACLR~ is
given as:

P~ACLR~ (dB) = (CLx-ile~BaseAggressor~ - CLx-ile~Aggressor~) +
(CLx-ile~Victim~ - CLx-ile~BaseVictim~)

Where, CLx-ile~BaseAggressor~ and CLx-ile~BaseVictim~ are the CLx-ile
used by the aggressor and the victim respectively in the base scenario
in Table 5.2B. CLx-ile~Aggressor~ and CLx-ile~Victim~ are the CLx-ile of
the aggressor and victim of interest respectively. For example, using
Power Control Set 1, for the scenario 10 MHz (aggressor) to 5 MHz
(victim), CLx-ile~Aggressor~ = 112 and CLx-ile~Victim~ = 115 dB. The
base scenario used is Scenario 2 of Table 5.2B (20 MHz (aggressor) to 10
MHz (victim)). Hence, in this example, CLx-ile~BaseAggressor~ = 109 dB
and CLx-ile~BaseVictim~ = 112 dB. Therefore, PACLR = (109 -- 112) + (115
-- 112) = 0 dB.

The final ACLR as reference by the victim's bandwidth is hence:

ACLR = Y + X -- F~ACLR~ + P~ACLR~

##### 5.1.1.4.2 Uplink Asymmetrical Bandwidths ACIR (Aggressor with smaller bandwidth)

Consider the scenario in Figure 5.4, the interference experienced by UE1
is affected by 25% ACLR of 30 + X - F~ACLR~ and 75% ACLR of 43 + X -
F~ACLR~. Since the victim bandwidth is larger than the aggressor, the
interference experienced by UE1 will caused by a mixture of ACLR 30 + X
- F~ACLR~ and ACLR 43 + X - F~ACLR~. For victim UE2 and UE3, the
interference is caused by ACLR 43 + X -- F~ALCR~. The effective
interference onto UE1 is dependent upon the aggressor and victim
bandwidths. If we take this level of interference and assumed that it is
caused by an aggressor of the same bandwidth (i.e. normalising the ACLR
to the victim bandwidth) we have the normalised ACLR in Table 5.2C.

Figure 5.4: 5 MHz E-UTRA aggressor to 20 MHz E-UTRA victim

Table 5.2.C: Value Y (normalised ACLR = Y + X - FALCR) for victim UE1

  Aggressor Bandwidth (MHz)   Victim: Value Y (dB): ACLR = (Y + X - F~ACLR~) measured over *B*~Victim~                     
  --------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------- -------- -------
                              20 MHz                                                                     15 MHz   10 MHz   5 MHz
  15 MHz                      29.93                                                                      \-       \-       \-
  10 MHz                      29.79                                                                      29.89    \-       \-
  5 MHz                       29.39                                                                      29.59    29.79    \-
  1.6 MHz                     28.02                                                                      28.48    28.99    29.56

The ACLR of the aggressor is likely to be larger than 43 + X dB after
the 2nd ACLR and hence it is reasonable to assume that the Y value of
the normalised ACLR in Table 5.2C onto victim UE1 is close to 30 dB.
This is similar to the symmetrical bandwidth coexistence scenario where
the first UE is affected by an ACLR of 30 + X dB. For victim UE2 and
UE3, the ACLR 43 + X is unrealistic. For scenario where the aggressor
bandwidth is much smaller than the victim bandwidth, the ACLR into UE2
and UE3 is going to be much larger than 43 + X. For example for 1.6 MHz
E-UTRA aggressor and 20 MHz E-UTRA victim, the interference into UE2 and
UE3 is caused by the 13th ACLR (of 1.6 MHz aggressor) and above and this
will likely be lower than the noise floor of the victim UE. Hence, the
interference experienced by UE2 and UE3 from an aggressor with a smaller
bandwidth will not be worse than that from an aggressor with a
symmetrical bandwidth. Therefore, the ACLR value for coexistence between
E-UTRA systems with symmetrical bandwidth is sufficient for coexistence
where the aggressor bandwidth is smaller than that of the victim.

#### 5.1.1.4 Frequency re-use and interference mitigation schemes for E-UTRA

For initial simulations, 1/1 frequency re-use shall be used.

#### 5.1.1.5 CQI estimation

It is assumed that the CQI including external system interference is
available before the scheduling process. This assumption is valid for
the victim system only.

#### 5.1.1.6 Power control modelling for E-UTRA and 3.84 Mcps TDD UTRA

No power control in downlink, fixed power per frequency resource block
is assumed.

The following power control equation shall be used for the initial
uplink (for E-UTRA and 3.84 Mcps TDD UTRA employing Enhanced UL)
coexistence simulations:

where *P*~max~ is the maximum transmit power, *R*~min~ is the minimum
power reduction ratio to prevent UEs with good channels to transmit at
very low power level, *CL* is the path coupling loss defined as max{path
loss-G\_Tx-G\_Rx, MCL}, where path loss is propagation loss plus
shadowfading, G\_TX is the transmitter antenna gain in the direction of
the receiver, G\_RX is the receiver antenna gain in the direction of the
transmitter and *CL~x-~*~ile~ is the *x*-percentile *CL* value. With
this power control equation, the *x* percent of UEs that have the
highest coupling loss will transmit at *P*~max~. Finally, 0\<γ\<=1 is
the balancing factor for UEs with bad channel and UEs with good channel:

The parameter sets for power control are specified in table 5.3.

Further discussion and alignment concerning power control algorithms may
be required after initial simulation results and further inputs from RAN
WG1 are available

#### 5.1.1.7 SIR target requirements for simulated services

For E-UTRA, shifted and truncated Shannon bound curves as specified in
Annex A.1 shall be used.

In the downlink, UTRA 3.84 Mcps TDD shall use HSDPA since most 3.84Mcps
TDD deployments service data traffic. A shifted and truncated Shannon
bound curves described in Annex A.3 shall be used.

In the uplink, UTRA 3.84 Mcps TDD shall use Enhanced UL with data
traffic. The shifted and truncated Shannon bound curve used for E-UTRA
uplink in Annex A.1 shall be used.

For E-UTRA TDD (LCR TDD frame structure based) shifted and truncated
Shannon bound curves as specified in Annex A.4 shall be used.

#### 5.1.1.8 Number of required snapshots

The number of snapshots shall be chosen such to obtain sufficient
statistical property of the results.

#### 5.1.1.9 Simulation output

Simulation results for E-UTRA as victim shall be presented in terms of
throughput reduction in percent relative to the reference throughput
without external interference vs. ACIR, separately for all UE and for
the 5% throughput CDF UE.

All the generated statistics (e.g. bitrates) are instantaneous
distributions on sub frame basis, not on a per-session basis. I.e. the
instantaneous bit rates need to be averaged in order to obtain the
session average UE throughput.

Simulation results for UTRA FDD as victim shall be presented in terms of
capacity reduction vs. ACIR. Capacity is defined by the number of
satisfied speech users.

Simulation results for UTRA 3,84 Mcps TDD as victim shall be presented
in terms of throughput reduction in percent relative to the reference
throughput without external interference vs. ACIR

### 5.1.2 Simulation description

Uplink and Downlink are simulated independently. Degradation of victim
system will be obtained by comparing capacity/throughput simulation
results of single operator scenario (without external interference) to
the multi operator case.

In the following sections the principle downlink simulation flows are
described, taking the current simulation assumptions into account.

For TDD simulations, both TDD networks (aggressor and victim) are
synchronised together and have a common downlink/uplink resource
allocation.

#### 5.1.2.1 Downlink E-UTRA interferer UTRA victim

1\. Run UTRA snapshot simulator procedure \[3\]. E-UTRA BS TX power is
set to the defined maximum TX power (assumes all RB in use). All E-UTRA
base stations are considered as a source of other system interference
(Iother). Iother = sum over all other system cells (interference power
into UTRA bandwidth including ACIR)

2\. Collect statistics.

The UTRA 3.84 Mcps TDD victim are synchronised and uses HSDPA service.
The simulation procedure shall be the same as that in Section 5.1.2.2
(Downlink E-UTRA interferer E-UTRA victim). Here, the CQI value in Step
2 (of Section 5.1.2.2) shall be calculated based on per resource unit
(timeslot × code) instead of per resource block.

#### 5.1.2.2 Downlink E-UTRA interferer E-UTRA victim

For i=1:\# of snapshots

1\. Distribute terminals randomly throughout the system area such that
to each cell within the HO margin of 3 dB the same number K of users is
allocated.

2\. Calculate DL CQI for each UE. The CQI value per resource block is
equal to C(RB)/I(RB), where:

\- C(RB) = power of resource block \* max (pathloss-G\_Tx-G\_Rx, MCL)

\- I(RB) = sum over all other cells (power of resource block \* max
(pathloss-G\_Tx-G\_Rx, MCL)) + sum over all other system cells
(interference power into this resource block including ACIR) + N

\- Note: in case of the 5 MHz and 10 MHz E-UTRA victim case, the BS ACLR
(ACIR) is modelled as flat, i.e. the same ACIR is used for all RB.

3\. Perform PS operation for all cells:

\- Loop over all cells

\- Loop over all UE attached to the cell

\- Select the next UE to be scheduled based on the scheduling metric
(i.e. randomly for Round Robin).

4\. Calculate actual intra/inter system interference to get the actual
C/I and bit rates for each UE.

\- Use the actual C/I to throughput mapping (Annex A) to determine the
obtained throughput for the UE.

\- Note: the actual C/I value of a scheduled RB is equal to the CQI
value calculated in step 2.

5\. Collect statistics.

#### 5.1.2.3 Uplink E-UTRA interferer UTRA victim

For i=1:\# of snapshots

1\. Distribute terminals randomly throughout the system area such that
to each cell within the HO margin of 3 dB the same number K of users is
allocated.

2\. Perform PS operation for all cells:

\- Loop over all cells

\- Loop over all UEs attached to the cell

\- Select the next UE to be scheduled based on the scheduling metric
(i.e. randomly for Round Robin)

\- Pick 4 RB among the "not scheduled" ones and mark it as "scheduled"

\- Set UE transmit power to

3 Run UTRA snapshot simulator procedure \[3\]. All E-UTRA terminals are
considered as a source of other system interference (Iother). Iother =
sum over all other system terminals (interference power into UTRA
bandwidth including ACIR).

4 Collect statistics.

For UTRA 3.84 Mcps TDD victim using Enhanced Uplink, the system TDD
victim shall be synchronised and simulation procedure shall be the same
as that in Section 5.1.2.4 (Uplink E-UTRA interferer E-UTRA victim).

#### 5.1.2.4 Uplink E-UTRA interferer E-UTRA victim

For i=1:\# of snapshots

1\. Distribute terminals randomly throughout the system area such that
to each cell within the HO margin of 3 dB the same number K of users is
allocated.

2\. Perform PS operation for all cells:

\- Loop over all cells

\- Loop over all UE attached to the cell

\- Select the next UE to be scheduled based on the scheduling metric
(i.e. randomly for Round Robin)

\- Pick 8 RB among the "not scheduled" ones and mark it as "scheduled"

\- Set UE transmit power to

3\. Calculate actual intra/inter system interference to get the actual
C/(I+N) and bit rates for each UE.

\- Use the actual C/(I+N) to throughput mapping as specified in Annex A
to determine the obtained throughput for the UE.

4\. Collect statistics.

#### 7.1.1.2 ACIR downlink 10MHz E-UTRA interferer -- 10MHz E-UTRA victim

Simulations are based on the following assumptions:

### 7.1.3 Additional coexistence simulation results

In this section, additional co-existence simulation results are
collected. Assumptions for these simulations may differ from those
described in section 5 of the present document.

#### 7.1.3.1 ACIR downlink E-UTRA interferer -- GSM victim

The key simulation parameters are summarized in table 7.12. The E-UTRA
and system scenario parameters are as described in section 5 of the
present document for rural macro cell environment with un-coordinated
base-station deployment, and the GSM parameters are taken from \[2\]
(Scenario\_2: UMTS (macro)-GSM (macro) in rural area). Different to the
simulation assumptions in \[2\], no correction of LTE BS ACLR according
to a spectrum mask was applied and the interference was assumed "flat"
across all GSM carriers. The GSM ACS was set such that the resulting
ACIR was dominated by the E-UTRA BS ACLR. For each ACIR value, E-UTRA
base-stations transmit at maximum power (in order to produce maximum
adjacent channel interference) and GSM UE are continuously added until
the system is fully loaded. The success/failure status of a GSM UE is
determined at a threshold of 0.5dB less than the required SINR target
\[2\]. Simulation results \[14\] are presented in figure 7.18

Figure 7.19: GSM downlink outage

An analytical investigation of E-UTRA-GSM downlink coexistence is
provided in \[15\]. In the \[2\] the aggressing UTRA influence on GSM is
modelled as constant ACIR over the whole GSM system bandwidth. The UTRA
system load is according to \[2\], i.e. 5% outage.

For an E-UTRA system the interference generated to the GSM system can be
modelled in the same way. Thus for a 5 MHz E-UTRA system the
interference to the adjacent channel can be considered to be constant
over the whole 5 MHz adjacent carrier. The other component of the ACIR
in this case is the ACS of a GSM MS. In \[2\] this has been assumed to
be significantly larger than the ACLR of the UTRA system and thus the
main contribution to the ACIR is the ACLR. For coexistence with an
E-UTRA aggressor and a UTRA victim the ACLR for EUTRA should be of the
same order as for UTRA. In \[2\] the ACLR for UTRA is assumed to be 50
dB.

Table 7.13: ACIR limit for 5% outage degradation in the GSM system for
relevant system scenarios. Numbers from \[2\]

  Scenario 1 UMTS(macro)   GSM(macro) Urban 500m cell radius, Uncoordinated    27-31 dB
  ------------------------ --------------------------------------------------- ----------
  Scenario 2 UMTS(macro)   GSM(macro) Rural 5000m cell radius, Uncoordinated   26-29 dB
  Scenario 5 UMTS(macro)   GSM(micro) Urban, Uncoordinated                     26-40 dB

The ACIR values obtained in \[2\] for which 5% outage degradation occurs
are listed in Table 7.13.

The difference between a UTRA and E-UTRA system is that for coexistence
studies the E-UTRA system is assumed to use full power. However since
the UTRA system has a reasonably high outage it will also use close to
maximum power and the difference between E-UTRA and UTRA should only be
a few dB.

In summary: For E-UTRA requirements on ACLR for the eNodeB similar to
the requirements on UTRA, i.e. around 50 dB, the performance degradation
on a GSM system is less than 5% outage degradation. This is also
confirmed by the simulation results in figure 7.19. Thus the present
coexistence scenario is not more constraining than the E-UTRA to E-UTRA
and E-UTRA to UTRA scenarios considered so far and need not be
considered when setting E-UTRA requirements.

In addition there are a number of factors that make the assumptions
above slightly pessimistic:

\- The interference in the neighboring channel has been assumed to be
flat. In practical systems however it falls off, which makes the GSM
carriers distant from the E-UTRA carrier less interfered. This will
reduce the outage degradation.

\- The E-UTRA system has been assumed to transmit at full power at all
times. However this is rarely the case in practical systems. Thus the
interference is lower and the outage degradation less.

For E-UTRA systems with narrower bandwidth than 5 MHz, e.g. 1.6 MHz the
power spectral density in the interfering region is higher if we assume
that the output power of an E-UTRA eNodeB is the same as for the 5 MHz
system. The increase is 5 dB which would increase the requirements in
table 7.13 with 5 dB. The interference will affect fewer GSM channels
though since the fall off previously mentioned is steeper for a 1.6 MHz
system.

#### 7.1.3.2 ACIR uplink E-UTRA interferer -- GSM victim

The key simulation parameters are summarized in table 7.14. The E-UTRA
and system scenario parameters are as described in section 5 of the
present document for rural macro cell environment with un-coordinated
base-station deployment, and the GSM parameters are taken from \[2\]
(Scenario\_2: UMTS (macro)-GSM (macro) in rural area). Simulations for
two scenarios have been presented, (a) in \[16\] and (b) in \[17\].
Different to the simulation assumptions in \[2\], no correction of LTE
UE ACLR according to a spectrum mask was applied and the interference
was assumed "flat" across all GSM carriers. Consequently, the ACIR has
been modelled as flat as well. The ACIR is here expressed in
dBc/1x375kHz (a) and dBc/4x375kHz (b) For each ACIR value, E-UTRA UEs
are firstly added to the system until it is fully loaded with 3
UEs/sector. Subsequently, GSM UEs are continuously added until the
system is fully loaded. The success/failure status of a GSM UE is
determined at the threshold of 0.5dB less than the required SINR target
\[2\]. Simulation results \[16, 17\] are presented in figure 7.19

Figure 7.19: GSM uplink outage

The results show that the outage increase in both cases (a) and (b)is
negligible even for flat ACLR/ACS and very low levels of ACIR.

#### 7.1.3.3 Asymmetric coexistence 20 MHz and 5 MHz E-UTRA

Simulations are based on the following assumptions:

Aggressor system: 20 MHz E-UTRA

Victim system: 5 MHz E-UTRA

Simulation frequency: 2000 MHz

Environment: Macro Cell, Urban Area, uncoordinated deployment

Cell Range 500 m

Generalising from 5 MHz and 10MHz to the 20MHz bandwidth we make the
following assumptions:

\- 3 UEs per carrier for aggressor and victim

\- The ACLR is expressed in dBc per bandwidth B occupied by the
aggressing UE

\- A 13dB ACLR improvement is assumed for frequency separations larger
than B from the edge of the UE occupied bandwidth.

The simulation results are given in Figure 7.20 and the numerical data
are presented in Table 7.15.

  45          0.1%                            0.1%

We also note some effects when a 5 MHz E-UTRA system aggresses a 20 MHz
E-UTRA system. Considering the case where the victim network bandwidth
is larger than the aggressing network bandwidth, the impact of the
aggressing UEs to the victim BS is lower than for the case of symmetric
bandwidth, because the \"shoulder\" of the ACLR of the immediately
adjacent aggressing UE will cover a smaller bandwidth of the victim
network. This case is therefore uncritical.

#### 7.1.3.4 Impact of cell range and simulation frequency on ACIR

The impact of cell range and simulation frequency is analysed by
comparing downlink scenarios with simulation frequency of 900MHz
(1.25MHz system bandwidth) and 2GHz (10MHz system bandwidth) and cell
ranges of 500m, 2000m and 5000m in urban and rural area environment.

For the 2GHz rural environment case 18dBi antenna gain and 45m antenna
height were assumed. Propagation model for the 2GHz rural environment
case is according to section 4.5.3 modified for 2GHz and 45m antenna
height with the following formula:

Where:

R is the base station-UE separation in kilometres

Figure 7.21 presents average system throughput loss in percent relative
to the reference throughput without external system interference. Figure
7.22 presents 5% CDF user throughput loss in percent relative to the

On the basis of the simulation results it can be assumed that the worst
case scenario is 2GHz, urban environment, 500m cell range.

### 7.1.4 Base station blocking simulation results

Figure 7.25 and Figure 7.26 show the CDF curves of the total received
power level in 10MHz bandwidth at the own system base stations in other
system operating frequency (blocking scenario) from all other system
terminals, using power control parameter set 1 and set 2, respectively.
The signal from all own system terminals was decreased by 49dB (assuming
terminal noise floor of -30dBm/1MHz it is 49dBc/3MHz for a 24dBm
terminal). The same simulator and simulation assumptions were used as
for coexistence studies in uplink for the E-UTRA system in 10MHz system
bandwidth.

![](media/image56.png)

base stations (10MHz) from all other system terminals, PC set 1

![](media/image57.png)

Figure 7.26: CDF of the total received power level at the own system
base stations (10MHz) from all other system terminals, PC set 2

Total received power level was assumed here for simplicity, however it
should be noted that this may be pessimistic as the most relevant RX
impairments are a nonlinear function of the blocker received power
levels present at the receiver input.

It is proposed the mean power of the interfering signal is equal to
-43dBm which is a compromise between the 30dBm Maximum Output Power
terminals defined in TR 36.803 and the 24dBm assumption in TR 36.942
under worst case MCL conditions.

7.2 RRM
-------

8 Rationales for co-existence requirements
==========================================

8.1 BS and UE ACLR
------------------

The metric for the degradation of a victim system by the presence of an
interfering system on adjacent channel in the present document is the
capacity loss (for UTRA as victim) or throughput loss (for E-UTRA as
victim) in dependence of Adjacent Channel Interference Ratio (ACIR).
ACIR is defined as

![](media/image58.wmf)

ACLR is the Adjacent Channel Leakage power Ratio of the interfering
systems transmitter (specified as the ratio of the mean power centred on
the assigned channel frequency to the mean power centred on an adjacent
channel frequency) and ACS is the corresponding receiver requirement on
Adjacent Channel Selectivity of the victim system receiver.

It is assumed that the capacity or throughput loss of the victim system
shall not exceed 5%. It is also assumed that ACIR is dominated by the UE
ACLR.

### 8.1.1 Requirements for E-UTRA -- UTRA co-existence 

In this case UTRA sets some constraints as ACLR and ACS as E-UTRA would
need to be deployed adjacent to both UTRA and E-UTRA. The two scenarios
are shown in figure 8.1

Figure 8.1: E-UTRA deployment scenarios

BS ACLR can be obtained from downlink simulation results presented in
section 7.1.1.1. For 5% UTRA capacity loss an E-UTRA BS ACLR of at least
33dB is required. Assuming the legacy UTRA ACLR of 45dB for E-UTRA BS
will result in less than 3% UTRA capacity loss.

UE ACLR can be obtained from uplink simulation results presented in
section 7.1.1.3. It must be noted that the simulation assumptions
represent a multiple worst case scenario which is unlikely to for real
network deployments. The simulation results for power control set 1 and
set 2 represent therefore the upper and lower boundary for the required
ACIR. It was demonstrated in \[9\] that the more aggressive power
control set 1 does not improve the throughput in some scenarios.
Moreover, additional improvements by more advanced schedulers
demonstrated in \[10\], \[11\], \[12\], have not been taken into account
for the simulations. Considering in addition UE implementation
constraints, a UE ACLR of 33dB represents a balanced approach of system
performance and UE complexity which is discussed in \[13\].

### 8.1.2 Requirements for E-UTRA -- E-UTRA co-existence

UE ACLR can be obtained from downlink simulation results presented in
section 7.1.1.4. With an E-UTRA UE ACLR of 30dB the mean and cell edge
user throughput degradation is less than 3% for both power control set 1
and power control set 2 and not taking into account the additional
improvements by more advanced scheduler mentioned previously.

9 Deployment aspects
====================

E-UTRA provides a significant number of features which can be exploited
to support operation in diverse frequency bands. The purpose of this
section is to provide informative description how these features can be
augment in a practical deployment

9.1 UE power distribution
-------------------------

Three scenarios have been considered, with the simulation assumptions
listed in Table 9.1. Note for scenario 3, the propagation model is
adopted from TR25.814 \[4\], where the penetration loss is included in
the propagation model.

### 9.1.1 Simulation results

Fig. 9.1 shows the UE transmit power distribution for different
scenarios when different PC parameters are used. Several observations
are made for the as follows:

\- For each scenario, the CDF curves for Pmin = -30dBm and Pmin = -40dBm
almost overlap with each other except for the power region where UEs
transmit around minimum power.

\- Generally speaking, UE transmit power for case 2 is greater than that
for case 1 for the power region where UEs transmit at high power. This
is because case 2 has larger cell size and results in higher UE power
for UEs located close to cell border. This is also confirmed in Table
9.3 that presents UE mean and 95% CDF power for different scenarios.

\- For case 3 where a micro cell size is simulated, UE transmit power is
not always lower than that for case 1 or 2. The reason is that the
pathloss model as shown in Table 9.1 includes penetration loss. As a
result, the pathloss is not necessarily smaller than that in case 1 or
2, where no penetration loss is considered. Since the PC scheme is based
on UE pathloss, the resulting UE power is not necessarily lower either.
However, as shown in Table 9.3, the UE mean and 95% CDF power is
significantly lower than their counterparts in case 1 or 2.

at a lower power than when PC set 1 is used, which is expected.

10 Multi-carrier BS requirements
================================

The purpose of this section is to provide **guidance how to interpret
transmitter and receiver requirements for multi-carrier BS.**

10.1 Unwanted emission requirements for multi-carrier BS
--------------------------------------------------------

### 10.1.1 General

In section 6.6 of TS 36.104 \[19\], unwanted emission requirements for
single carrier or multi-carrier BS are specified. This multi-carrier BS
corresponds to the multi-carrier BS of the same channel bandwidth for
E-UTRA. The following two pragmatic scenarios can be considered.

\- multi-carrier BS of different E-UTRA channel bandwidths

\- multi-carrier BS of E-UTRA and UTRA

Different LTE channel bandwidths have different operating band unwanted
emissions requirement. Only 5 MHz and higher channel bandwidths have the
same requirement. E-UTRA and UTRA have different mask requirements. In
section 10.1.2 and 10.1.3, unwanted emission requirements for BS with
different channel bandwidths and in case of E-UTRA and UTRA with
following limited scenarios are introduced as a guideline.

\- multi-carrier BS of different E-UTRA channel bandwidths covering only
5 MHz and higher channel bandwidths\
(less than 5 MHz is FFS)

> As an example, we can assume an operation such as the channel
> bandwidth of 10 MHz for the 1st carrier and that of 5 MHz for the
> adjacent carrier as shown in Figure 10.1.

![](media/image65.emf)

**Figure 10.1: multi-carrier BS of different E-UTRA channel bandwidths**

\- multi-carrier BS of different E-UTRA and UTRA covering only 5 MHz and
higher E-UTRA channel bandwidths\
(less than 5 MHz is FFS)

> As an example, we can assume an operation such as E-UTRA with channel
> bandwidth of 5 MHz for 1st carrier and UTRA for adjacent carrier as
> shown in Figure 10.2.

![](media/image66.emf)

**Figure 10.2: multi-carrier BS of E-UTRA and UTRA**

\- only multi-carrier BS with contiguous carriers are considered.

\- the guidelines below assumes that the power spectral density of the
multiple carriers is the same.

All other combinations of multiple carriers are ffs.

### 10.1.2 Multi-carrier BS of different E-UTRA channel bandwidths

Among the unwanted emissions, the transmitter spurious emissions
requirements in \[19\] should be applied irrespective of channel
bandwidth. Therefore, ACLR and Operating band unwanted emissions
requirements for such a scenario of different channel bandwidths should
be specified as follows:

> For multi-carrier E-UTRA BS of different channel bandwidths (≥5 MHz),
> the channel bandwidth of the outer most carrier in the operating band
> should be considered. That is, the corresponding requirements for the
> channel bandwidth of the outer most carrier should be applied at
> either side of the operating band as shown in Figure 10.3.

From a co-existence point of view, this guideline means that
multi-carrier BS should not cause larger interference to adjacent
systems than single carrier BS. From the specification's complexity
point of view, this concept seems reasonable.

![](media/image67.emf)

**Figure 10.3: Unwanted emissions requirements for multi-carrier BS of
different E-UTRA channel bandwidths**

### 10.1.3 Multi-carrier BS of E-UTRA and UTRA

Among the unwanted emissions, the transmitter spurious emissions
requirements in \[19\] should be applied for E-UTRA at frequencies
within the specified frequency ranges, which are

\- more than 10 MHz below the lowest frequency of the BS transmitter
operating band if E-UTRA is the lowest carrier or

\- more than 10 MHz above the highest frequency of the BS transmitter
operating band if E-UTRA is the highest carrier.

Exceptions are the requirement in Table 6.6.4.3-2 and 6.6.4.3-3 of
\[19\] that apply also closer than 10 MHz from operating band.

For UTRA, the transmitter spurious emissions requirements in \[20\]
should be applied at frequencies within the specified frequency ranges,
which are

\- more than 12.5MHz below the first carrier used if UTRA is the lowest
carrier or

\- more than 12.5 MHz above the last carrier frequency used if UTRA is
the highest carrier.

Exceptions are the requirement in Clause 6.6.3.5 and 6.6.3.8 of \[20\]
that apply also closer than 12.5 MHz from the outermost carrier
frequency used.

Furthermore, Spectrum emission mask (SEM) applies to a UTRA BS
transmitting on single RF carrier \[20\]. Thus SEM should not be applied
to multi-carrier BS of different RATs. Therefore, ACLR and Operating
band unwanted emissions requirements for such a scenario with E-UTRA and
UTRA should be specified as follows:

> For multi-carrier BS of E-UTRA (channel bandwidth(s) ≥5 MHz) and UTRA,
> the RAT being used at the edge of the operating band should be
> considered. That is, the corresponding requirements for the RAT being
> used on the outer most carrier should be applied at either side of the
> operating band as shown in Figure 10.4.

From a co-existence point of view, this guideline means that
multi-carrier BS should not cause larger interference to adjacent
systems than single carrier BS. From the specification's complexity
point of view, this concept seems reasonable.

![](media/image68.emf)

**Figure 10.4: Unwanted emissions requirements for multi-carrier BS of
E-UTRA and UTRA**

10.2 Receiver requirements for multi-carrier BS
-----------------------------------------------

### 10.2.1 General

In a multi-carrier receiver, it is possible to set the processing
bandwidth (i.e. used receiver BW) wider than a single E-UTRA channel
bandwidth. Both TX and RX requirements in \[19\] are specified at the BS
antenna connector. From this perspective there is a fundamental
difference between a multi-carrier transmitter and a multi-carrier
receiver. At the antenna connector, the "lowest carrier frequency used"
and the "highest carrier frequency used" can be recognized via the
emitted spectrum on the TX path. Therefore the same test set-up can be
used for a single-carrier and a multi-carrier transmitter. However, on
the RX path, as long as a test is performed with a single wanted
carrier, it is impossible to identify at the antenna connector the
lowest and the highest carrier frequency where *simultaneously* a
certain performance is achieved. A multi-carrier receiver should
therefore be tested with a multi-carrier wanted signal.

With a multi-carrier wanted signal, the same principles applied to
multi-carrier TX testing can also be applied to RX testing. The
manufacturer declares which frequency range and multi-carrier bandwidths
that are supported. The lowest and the highest supported bandwidth are
tested as specified in section 4.7 of TS 36.141\[21\]. A wanted signal
is applied at the lower edge of the tested multi-carrier bandwidth.
Another wanted signal is applied at the upper edge of the tested
multi-carrier bandwidth. It is not deemed necessary to apply wanted
signals between the outer carriers, because usually the worst
performance is obtained at the outer channels. In the Reference
sensitivity measurement only the two wanted signals are applied. In the
ACS, blocking and intermodulation measurements interferers are applied
at frequencies outside the tested multi-carrier bandwidth, with spacing
as defined for each requirement in relation to the closest wanted signal
respectively. Following the TX testing approach, no requirements are
specified for interferers between the wanted channels.

Current specification allows the desensitization of the wanted signals
in the presence of an interfering signal e.g., in the ACS test. It is
FFS whether this desensitization should be consider further for
multi-carrier case.

Regarding Dynamic range and In-channel selectivity, a similar approach
as for the Reference sensitivity level can be adopted, i.e. two
simultaneous wanted signals, one at the lowest assigned channel
frequency and one at the highest assigned channel frequency are chosen,
together with their corresponding in-channel interfering signals. That
is to say, that the currently specified single carrier requirements
should be simultaneously fulfilled at the lowest and highest assigned
E-UTRA channel frequency.

### 10.2.2 Test principles for a multi-carrier BS of equal or different E-UTRA channel bandwidths

The following principles are proposed for receiver requirements in case
of multi-carrier BS. Only 5 MHz and higher channel bandwidths are
considered (less than 5 MHz is FFS):

\- In a receiver that can receive multiple contiguous carrier over a
declared multi-carrier bandwidth, two wanted carriers are tested
simultaneously, at both edges of the multi-carrier bandwidth.

\- There are no requirements for interfering signals between the wanted
carriers.

\- Only the highest and the lowest supported multi-carrier bandwidth are
tested.

\- The same set of interfering signals is used as in the equivalent
single-carrier test. E.g. in a blocking test there is only one blocker
at a time, even though two simultaneous wanted signals are used.

\- The test is repeated for the lower and upper wanted signals, with the
interfering signals below the lower and above the higher wanted signal
respectively. The properties of the interferer(s) are chosen according
to the requirements of the closest wanted signal.

\- For the receiver tests the desensitization for the wanted signals
should be the same as for the single carrier case.

11 Rationale for unwanted emission specifications
=================================================

Unwanted emissions are divided into "Out-of-band emission" and "Spurious
emissions" in 3GPP RF specifications. This notation is in line with
ITU-R recommendations such as SM.329 ‎‎\[22\] and the Radio Regulations
‎\[23\]. ITU defines:

**Out-of-band emission** = Emission on a frequency or frequencies
immediately outside the necessary bandwidth which results from the
modulation process, but excluding spurious emissions.

**Spurious emission** = Emission on a frequency, or frequencies, which
are outside the necessary bandwidth and the level of which may be
reduced without affecting the corresponding transmission of information.
Spurious emissions include harmonic emissions, parasitic emissions,
intermodulation products and frequency conversion products but exclude
out-of-band emissions.

**Unwanted emissions** = Consist of spurious emissions and out-of-band
emissions.

Some requirements in \[19\] may only apply in certain regions either as
optional requirements or set by local and regional regulation as
mandatory requirements. It is normally not stated in the 3GPP
specifications under what exact circumstances the requirements apply,
since this is defined by local or regional regulation.

All requirements that may be applied differently in different regions
are listed in \[19\] Clause 4.3.

11.1 Out of band Emissions
--------------------------

Out of band emissions are unwanted emissions immediately outside the
channel bandwidth resulting from the modulation process and
non-linearity in the transmitter but excluding spurious emissions. This
out of band emission requirement is specified both in terms of operating
band unwanted emissions and adjacent channel power ratio (ACLR) for the
transmitter. ACLR is specified mainly as a measure of the capability of
the transmitter to guarantee the interfering signal below an acceptable
level to the adjacent system to allow-coexistence. ACLR is also a
regulatory requirement in certain countries. Operating band unwanted
emissions is specified mainly as a measure of the capability of the
transmitter to comply with certain regional regulatory requirements.

### 11.1.1 Operating band unwanted emission requirements for E-UTRA BS (spectrum emission mask)

E-UTRA should have a operating band unwanted emissions (spectrum
emissions mask, SEM) requirements defined, based on the following
prerequisites.

\- SEM should be defined with a reference bandwidth of 100 kHz..

\- The SEM limit should also be set to allow some variations due to
varying power allocation between resource blocks.

\- FCC requirements \[25\] which apply mainly in Region 2 should be
defined separately as an absolute limit and may need a smaller reference
bandwidth in some cases.

\- In UTRA, the spectrum emissions mask is not only defined in the OOB
domain, but also across the spurious domain inside the operating band.
This can also be the case for the E-UTRA mask, as long as the limits in
the spurious domain are consistent with recommended spurious limits in
SM.329 \[22\]. The "unified" in-band OOB + spurious emissions for E-UTRA
can be named *"unwanted emissions"* which is the agreed terminology
\[25\] that encompasses both OOB and spurious emissions.

\- The SEM limit should apply for both single and multi-carrier BS.

\- FCC requirements as defined in \[25\] apply for bands 2, 4, 5, 10,
12, 13, 14, 17, 35 and 36 as additional limits.

The Operating band unwanted emission limits are defined as a "mask" that
stretches from 10 MHz below the lowest frequency of the BS transmitter
operating band up to 10 MHz above the highest frequency of the BS
transmitter operating band, as shown in Figure 11.1. Parts of the mask
will be in the out-of-band domain (within +/-2.5 times the necessary
bandwidth of the carrier) and parts will be in the spurious domain..

The unwanted emission limit in the part of the operating band that falls
in the spurious domain must be consistent with SM.329 \[22\]. Based on
the Category B spurious emission limits in \[22\] a level of -25 dBm in
100 kHz (-15 dBm in 1 MHz) is selected as the lower bound for the
unwanted emission limits. This is consistent with the level used for
UTRA as spurious emission limit inside the operating band. Further
details on the spurious emission limits and their interpretation for
UTRA (and E-UTRA) are given in TR 25.942 \[3\], clause 14.2.

For E-UTRA Bands 2, 4, 5, 10, 12, 13, 14, 17, 35, 36, an additional
Unwanted emission limit is derived from FCC Title 47 \[25\] Parts 22, 24
and 27. The requirement stated in \[25\] is interpreted as -13 dBm in a
measurement bandwidth defined as 1% of the \"-26 dB modulation
bandwidth\". For the E-UTRA channel bandwidths, the following additional
requirements are defined:

**- 1.4 MHz channel bandwidth**: -14 dBm in 10 kHz, which assumes that
the \"-26 dB modulation bandwidth\" is \< 1.26 MHz.

**- 3 MHz channel bandwidth**: -13 dBm in 30 kHz, which assumes that the
\"-26 dB modulation bandwidth\" is \< 3.0 MHz.

**- 5 MHz channel bandwidth**: -15 dBm in 30 kHz, which assumes that the
\"-26 dB modulation bandwidth\" is \< 4.75 MHz.

**- 10 MHz channel bandwidth**: -13 dBm in 100 kHz, which assumes that
the \"-26 dB modulation bandwidth\" is \< 10 MHz.

**- 15 MHz channel bandwidth**: -15 dBm in 100 kHz, which assumes that
the \"-26 dB modulation bandwidth\" is \< 15.8 MHz.

**- 20 MHz channel bandwidth**: -16 dBm in 100 kHz, which assumes that
the \"-26 dB modulation bandwidth\" is \< 20 MHz.

The additional limit outside the first MHz adjacent to the channel
bandwidth, for all channel bandwidths, is -13dBm/100kHz for E-UTRA Bands
5, 12, 13, 14, 17, and -13dBm/1MHz for E-UTRA Bands 2, 4, 10, 35 and 36.

Figure 11.1 Defined frequency range for Operating band unwanted
emissions with an example RF carrier and related mask shape.

The requirements shall apply whatever the type of transmitter considered
(single carrier or multi-carrier). It applies for all transmission modes
foreseen by the manufacturer\'s specification.

Emissions shall not exceed the maximum level specified in \[19\] for
\[any\] BS maximum output power, where:

\- ∆f is the separation between the channel edge frequency and the
nominal -3dB point of the measuring filter closest to the carrier
frequency.

\- f\_offset is the separation between the channel edge frequency and
the centre of the measuring filter.

\- f\_offset~max~ is the offset to the frequency 10 MHz outside the
operating band edge.

\- ∆f~max~ is equal to f\_offset~max~ minus half of the bandwidth of the
measuring filter.

Minimum BS requirements for Category A and Category B are specified in
\[19\].

### 11.1.2 ACLR requirements for E-UTRA BS 

If there is to be both an ACLR-type requirement with carrier-wide
reference bandwidth and a mask (SEM) with much narrower reference
bandwidth, the ACLR limit should be somewhat stricter than the
integrated SEM. In this way, the ACLR can capture the "average"
behaviour over a carrier, while the SEM can take into account the
variations in the spectrum emissions resulting from variations in power
allocations.

Since it is important to assess sharing properties both with adjacent
UTRA systems and with E-UTRA carriers the ACLR is defined with different
bandwidths:

\- ACLR/UTRA in a 1st and 2nd adjacent channel with 5 MHz and/or 1.6 MHz
reference bandwidth depending on paired or unpaired spectrum.

\- ACLR/E-UTRA (reference bandwidth equal to E-UTRA channel bandwidth)
in a 1st and 2nd adjacent channel.

\- For carriers with channel bandwidth larger than 5 MHz positioned
close to or adjacent to the band edge, the 1^st^ or 2^nd^ adjacent
channel that define the ACLR/E-UTRA may fall partly or fully outside the
point 10 MHz from the band edge. If it is fully outside, it should not
be defined. If it is partly outside it can still be defined, but may not
be limiting compared to the unwanted emission limits defined by SEM and
spurious emissions.

\- ACLR should apply for both single and multi-carrier BS.

ACLR measured in other reference bandwidths (smaller or larger) than the
E-UTRA carrier or 5 MHz are indirectly defined by the mask.

ACLR is defined for two cases as shown in Figure 11.2, i.e. for 1^st^
and 2^nd^ adjacent E-UTRA carriers of the same bandwidth and for 1^st^
and 2^nd^ adjacent UTRA carriers. Separate limits are defined for each
channel bandwidth. The requirements can be stated with two tables, one
for adjacent E-UTRA and one for adjacent UTRA.

Figure 11.2 The two defined ACLR measures, one for 1^st^ and 2^nd^
adjacent E-UTRA carriers and one for 1^st^ and 2^nd^ adjacent UTRA
carrier.

Minimum BS requirements for Category A and Category B are specified in
\[19\]. BS ACLR requirements are captured for E-UTRA operating in paired
spectrum and in unpaired spectrum. For Category A, either the limits in
\[19\] or the absolute limit of -13dBm/MHz (Note 2) apply, whatever is
less stringent. For Category B, the numbers are based on the
co-existence simulations outlined in this TR 36.942. Either the limits
in \[19\] or the absolute limit of -15dBm/MHz apply, whatever is less
stringent.

NOTE: Whether the absolute limit is applicable to other base station
classes is ffs.

NOTE2 Since the limits -13 dBm and -15 dBm are regulatory requirements
taken from Category A and B spurious emissions respectively, the test
requirement shall also be -13dBm and -15 dBm respectively, i.e. the test
tolerance shall be zero when deriving the test limit.

The ACLR2 for the UTRA is set to be the same as ACLR1. It was revealed
in \[26\] and \[27\] that the second adjacent channel interference
contributes only little to overall ACIR because ACLR/ACS in the second
adjacent channel is significantly higher than the UTRA UE ACS1.

It was pointed out in \[28\] that an E-UTRA BSs must not cause larger
interference (in terms of absolute power) to the co-existing UTRA system
than the one allowed in the current 3GPP requirements, irrespective of
its channel bandwidth.

For the deployment in Japan, additional spurious emission requirement to
protect co-existing (domestic) wireless systems may be required for
certain bands (i.e. E-UTRA Band 1, 6, 9, and 11) in order to limit the
ACI in 10, 15, and 20 MHz Channel BW options.

The measurement filter for the transmitted E-UTRA carrier and the
adjacent E-UTRA carrier is a rectangular filter with a bandwidth equal
to the transmission bandwidth configuration *N*~RB~ ∙ 180 kHz. For
ACLR/UTRA, the power of the adjacent carrier is measured using an RRC
filter with roll-off factor α =0.22.

Adjacent Channel Leakage power Ratio (ACLR) is the ratio of the filtered
mean power centered on the assigned channel frequency to the filtered
mean power centred on an adjacent channel frequency.

The requirements shall apply whatever the type of transmitter considered
(single carrier or multi-carrier). It applies for all transmission modes
foreseen by the manufacturer\'s specification.

11.2 Spurious emissions
-----------------------

### 11.2.1 BS Spurious emissions 

Spurious emissions are defined in ITU-R Radio Regulations ‎\[23\] and
SM.329 ‎\[22\].

The UTRA core requirements for spurious emissions are specified for the
BS in TS 25.104 ‎\[20\].

References for the spurious emissions requirements are summarised in
Table 11.1 for the BS. The tables give references to RAN4 core specs, to
where the term is defined and to some relevant regulatory references.
These regulatory references have either defined the limit value in 3GPP
or they have used it as a basis for studies or recommendations.

### 11.2.2 General spurious emissions requirements for E-UTRA BS

The definition of "Operating band unwanted emissions" for E-UTRA covers
not only the OOB domain, but also the spurious domain inside the
operating band, including the 10 MHz of spectrum immediately above and
below the operating band. For that reason, there is no need to define
spurious emission limits inside the operating band as shown in Figure
11.3. The implication is that the rule that spurious emissions start at
a point separated from the carrier centre by 250% of the necessary
bandwidth is not applied. Note however that since parts of the Operating
band unwanted emission limits will fall inside the spurious domain, they
are bound by the same regulatory limits that define spurious emissions.
The operating band unwanted emission limits are further discussed in
Clause 11.1.1.

Since the spurious emission limits defined here does not cover the
frequency range of the spurious domain inside the operating band, they
should be named "Spurious emissions outside the operating band", in
order to distinguish them from the definition of spurious emissions in
the spurious domain in ITU-R SM.329 \[22\].

Figure 11.3 Defined frequency ranges for spurious emissions and
operating band unwanted emissions

Spurious emission limits as defined in ITU-R SM.329‎\[22\] are divided
into several Categories, where Category A and B are applied for 3GPP as
regional requirements. The Category A and Category B spurious emission
limits in Tables 11.2 and 11.3 are in line with ITU-R SM.329‎\[22\].
They would apply outside of the region where the limits for "Operating
band unwanted emissions" are defined (operating band plus 10 MHz on each
side). Further details on the spurious emission limits and their
interpretation for UTRA (and E-UTRA) are given in TR 25.942 \[3\],
clause 14.2.

### 11.2.3 Specification of BS Spurious emissions outside the operating band

The spurious emission limits (except the protection of PHS and Public
Safety operations) apply in frequency ranges that are more than 10 MHz
below the lowest BS transmitter frequency of the operating band and more
than 10 MHz above the highest BS transmitter frequency of the operating
band. The requirements shall apply whatever the type of transmitter
considered (single carrier or multi-carrier). It applies for all
transmission modes foreseen by the manufacturer\'s specification.

Minimum BS spurious emissions requirements are specified in \[19\]
including Category A, Category B, protection of the BS receiver of own
or different BS, co-existence with other systems in the same
geographical area, limits for BS in geographic coverage area of PHS,
limits for protection of public safety operations and co-location with
other base stations.

BS Spurious emissions limits for BS co-located with another BS in \[19\]
do not apply for the 10 MHz frequency range immediately outside the BS
transmit frequency range of an operating band. This is also the case
when the transmit frequency range is adjacent to the Band for the
co-location requirement. The current state-of-the-art technology does
not allow a single generic solution for co-location with other system on
adjacent frequencies for 30dB BS-BS minimum coupling loss. However,
there are certain site-engineering solutions that can be used. These
techniques are addressed in TR 25.942 \[3\].

### 11.2.4 Additional spurious emissions requirements

These requirements may be applied for the protection of system operating
in frequency ranges other than the E-UTRA BS operating band. The limits
may apply as an optional protection of such systems that are deployed in
the same geographical area as the E-UTRA BS, or they may be set by local
or regional regulation as a mandatory requirement for an E-UTRA
operating band. It is in some cases not stated in \[19\] whether a
requirement is mandatory or under what exact circumstances that a limit
applies, since this is set by local or regional regulation. An overview
of regional requirements is given in \[19\] Clause 4.3.

### 12.1.2 Number of UEs per sub-frame 

For downlink, the number of UEs per sub-frame would not affect the
simulation results, because the total transmission power for the system
would be constant. The number of UEs per sub-frame for downlink is
presented in Table 12.3.

Table 12.3 Number of UEs per sub-frame for downlink

  System         Number of UEs per subframe   Number of RBs per UE
  -------------- ---------------------------- ----------------------
  LTE            1 UEs                        50 RBs
  LTE-Advanced   1 UEs                        200 RBs

For uplink, the number of UEs per sub-frame might affect the simulation
results, because the total transmission power for the system would
depend on the number of UEs per sub-frame. Since the number of resource
blocks for one UE would be typically 8\~16 in the actual UL scheduler,
it is proposed that the number of UEs per sub-frame is calculated as
follows:

(Number of UEs per sub-frame) = round down ((Total number of RBs for the
system) / 16)

The number of UEs per sub-frame for uplink is presented in Table 12.4.

Table 12.4 Number of UEs per sub-frame for uplink

  System         Number of UEs per subframe   Number of RBs per UE
  -------------- ---------------------------- -------------------------
  LTE            3 UEs                        16 RBs (Total: 48 RBs)
  LTE-Advanced   12 UEs                       16 RBs (Total: 192 RBs)

Note: The resource block size should be 180 kHz instead of 375 kHz.

### 12.1.3 ACIR model

The ACIR is defined as the ratio of the total power transmitted from an
aggressor transmitter (BS or UE) to the total interference power
affecting a victim receiver, resulting from both transmitter and
receiver imperfections. Thus, ACIR = P~aggressor~ -- P~victim~ (all in
dB), where P~aggressor~ is the transmit power of an aggressor and
P~victim~ is the interference power at the victim receiver.

#### 12.1.3.1 Uplink ACIR model

For uplink, it is assumed that the ACIR is dominated by the UE ACLR. As
shown in Figure 12.1 and Table 12.5, the bandwidth for each ACIR value
was assumed to be the same as the transmission bandwidth of LTE-A UE.
Outside ACIR1/2 regions, ACIR3 was used for all the regions. Those
models are modified model, in which the ACIR3 is smaller than ACIR2
based on the actual spectrum shape.

  **ACIR2**   **43 + X**   **43 + X**
  **ACIR3**   **50 + X**   **43 + X**

The bandwidth of victim UEs are same that of aggressor UEs in Scenario
\#1 and \#2 (victim in LTE or LTE-Advanced). ACIR value could be
calculated from uplink ACIR model shown in table 12.6.

  **0 RBs**                                                        **30 + X**
  **16 RBs**                                                       **43 + X**
  **≥32RBs**                                                       **50 + X**

For Scenario \#3 (3.84 MHz UTRA victim), the bandwidth of victim UEs are
larger than that of aggressor UEs (2.88 MHz = 180 kHz x 16 RBs). As
shown in figure 12.2, 12.3 and 12.4, victim UE suffer from the
interference composed by two ACIR regions from an aggressor UE in
asymmetrical bandwidths case. Based on the method described in
5.1.1.4.2, ACIR value from a UE could be calculated as shown in table
12.7.

For Scenario \#4 (1.28 MHz UTRA victim), the bandwidth of victim UEs are
smaller than that of aggressor UEs (2.88 MHz = 180 kHz x 16 RBs). As
shown in figure 12.5, 12.6 and 12.7, victim UE suffer from the
interference one ACIR region from an aggressor UE. Based on the method
described in 5.1.1.4.2, ACIR value from a UE could be calculated as
shown in table 12.8.

#### 12.1.3.2 Downlink ACIR model

For downlink a common ACIR obtained from the LTE-A BS ACLR and the
victim UE ACS requirements can be used for all frequency resource blocks
independent of their position in the aggressor channel. The ACLR of the
LTE-A BS is much bigger than the ACS of the victim ACS and therefore has
negligible impact on ACIR performance. In other words, the BS ACLR can
be assumed as infinite and ACIR is only a function of the victim UE ACS,
which can be mathematically described as ACIR = Average + X (in dB),
where X is an offset relative to the "Average". For Scenarios 1 and 3,
the "Average" is determined from the UE ACS requirements (ACS1, ACS2 and
ACS3) according to the respective specifications by the following
relation (all parameters in dB):

For Scenario 2, the "Average" is based on an assumption for the 40 MHz
LTE-A ACS.

For Scenarios 4, the "Average" is determined from the UE ACS
requirements (ACS1, ACS2 and ACS3) according to the respective
specifications by the following relation (all parameters in dB):

As shown in figure 12.8, figure 12.9, figure 12.10 and table 12.9, the
ACIR offset calculated from the victim UE performance in TR25.101 for
UTRA and TR36.101 for LTE of UE ACS.

### 12.1.4 Uplink power control

For downlink, no power control scheme is applied and the transmission
power per RB should be constant.

For LTE coexistence study, the fractional power control was used for the
initial uplink coexistence simulations. It is noted that the parameter
CLx-ile in the table below is the same for both 40 MHz and 10 MHz
systems because it is assumed that each UE is assigned 16 RBs in either
system.

  Note: , adjustment parameter related to different carrier frequency point. For fc=2GHz, =0dB.                       

In RAN1 TS36.213, The setting of the UE Transmit power for the physical
uplink shared channel (PUSCH) transmission in subframe i is defined by:

Note 1: = 0 dB, = 0 dB, and *PL* in the above equation is equivalent to
*CL* defined in TR 36.942 Section 5.1.1.6.

Note 2: should be derived from CL~x-ile~ so that the actual transmission
power should be the same as the one for PC Set 1/2. Following this
principle, can be obtained and included in the table below, assuming
each UE occupies 16RBs (as shown in Section 12.1.2):

########  Annex A (informative): Link Level Performance Model

A.1 Description
---------------

Annex A.2 provides detail on how the baseline throughput curves are
derived. It shows that the throughput of a modem with link adaptation
can be approximated by an attenuated and truncated form of the Shannon
bound. (The Shannon bound represents the maximum theoretical throughput
than can be achieved over an AWGN channel for a given SNR). The
following equations approximate the throughput over a channel with a
given SNR, when using link adaptation:

Where: S(SNIR) is the Shannon bound: S(SNIR) = log~2~(1+SNIR) bps/Hz

> α Attenuation factor, representing implementation losses\
> SNR~MIN~ Minimum SNIR of the codeset, dB\
> Thr~MAX~ Maximum throughput of the codeset, bps/Hz\
> SNIR~MAX~ SNIR at which max throughput is reached S^-1^(Thr~MAX~), dB

The parameters α, SNR~MIN~ and THR~MAX~ can be chosen to represent
different modem implementations and link conditions. The parameters
proposed in table 1 represent a baseline case, which assumes:

\- 1:2 antenna configurations

\- Typical Urban fast fading channel model (10kmph DL, 3kmph UL)

\- Link Adaptation (see table 1 for details of highest and lowest rate
codes)

\- Channel prediction

\- HARQ

A.2 Modelling of Link Adaptation 
--------------------------------

Figure A.3 Coding and Modulation for Transmission of data over a radio
link

Figure A.3 shows a radio transmitter and receiver. The throughput over a
radio link is the number of data bits that can be successfully
transmitted per modulation symbol. Coding (more specifically, Forward
Error Correction) adds redundant bits to the data bits which can correct
errors in the received bits. The degree of coding is determined by its
*rate*, the proportion of data bits to coded bits. This typically varies
from 1/8^th^ to 4/5^ths^. Coded bits are then converted into modulation
symbols. The order of the modulation determines the number coded bits
that can be transmitted per modulation symbol. Typical examples are QPSK
and 16 QAM, which have 2 and 4 bits per modulation symbol, respectively.

The maximum throughput of a given MCS (Modulation and Coding Scheme) is
the product of the rate and the number of bits per modulation symbol.
Throughput has units of data bits per modulation symbol. This is
commonly normalised to a channel of unity bandwidth, which carries one
symbol per second. The units of throughput then become bits per second,
per Hz.

A given MCS requires a certain SNIR (measured at the rx antenna) to
operate with an acceptably low BER (Bit Error Rate) in the output data.
An MCS with a higher throughput needs a higher SNIR to operate. AMC
(Adaptive Modulation and Coding) works by measuring and feeding back the
channel SNIR to the transmitter, which then chooses a suitable MCS from
a 'codeset' to maximise throughput at that SNIR. A codeset contains many
MCS's and is designed to cover a range of SNRs. An example of a codeset
is shown in Figure A.4. Each MCS in the codeset has the highest
throughput for a 1-2dB range of SNIR.

![](media/image113.emf)

Figure A.4 Throughput of a set of Coding and Modulation Combinations,
AWGN channels assumed

Figure A.4 also shows the Shannon bound, which represents the maximum
theoretical throughput that can be achieved over an AWGN channel with a
given SNR. The example AMC system achieves around 0.75x the throughput
of the Shannon bound, over the range of SNR which it operates. We can
approximate the performance of AMC with an attenuated and truncated form
of the Shannon bound as shown in Figure A.5.

![](media/image114.emf)

Figure A.5 Approximating AMC With an Attenuated and Truncated form of
the Shannon Bound

The following equations approximate the throughput over a channel with a
given SNR, when using AMC:

Where:

> S(SNIR) is the Shannon bound: S(SNIR) = log~2~(1+SNIR)
>
> α Attenuation factor (0.75 for the example codeset)\
> SNR~MIN~ Minimum SNIR of the codeset (-6.5dB for the example codeset)\
> Thr~MAX~ Maximum throughput (4.8 bit/sec/Hz for the example codeset)\
> SNIR~MAX~ SNIR at which max throughput is reached S^-1^(Thr~MAX~)
> (17dB for the example codeset)

A.3 UTRA 3.84 Mcps TDD HSDPA Link Level Performance
---------------------------------------------------

The throughput is derived from the HSDPA link level results of \[8\] and
is found to match a truncated Shannon bound with an attenuation of 0.5.
The HSDPA UTRA 3.84 Mcps TDD throughput is normalised to 15 timeslots
and the spectral efficiency is found assuming a bandwidth of 5MHz. The
spectral efficiency in table A.3 is presented as a function of the SINR
in a timeslot. Figure A.6 shows the UTRA 3.84 Mcps TDD spectral
efficiency as a function of SINR in a timeslot and the attenuated
Shannon approximation. NOTE: RX Diversity is not employed.

The attenuated Shannon approximation to UTRA 3.84 Mcps TDD spectral
efficiency is based on the approach used for E-UTRA. The maximum
spectral efficiency is derived assuming a code rate of 0.9 and 16QAM

efficiency is:

A.4 Link Level Performance for E-UTRA TDD (LCR TDD frame structure based)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

The throughput of a modem with link adaptation can be approximated by an
attenuated and truncated form of the Shannon bound. (The Shannon bound
represents the maximum theoretical throughput than can be achieved over
an AWGN channel for a given SNR). The following equations approximate
the throughput over a channel with a given SNR, when using link
adaptation:

Where:

> S(SNIR) Shannon bound, S(SNIR) =log~2~(1+SNIR) bps/Hz
>
> α Attenuation factor, representing implementation losses\
> SNR~MIN~ Minimum SNIR of the codeset, dB\
> Thr~MAX~ Maximum throughput of the codeset, bps/Hz\
> SNIR~MAX~ SNIR at which max throughput is reached S^-1^(Thr~MAX~), dB

The parameters α, SNR~MIN~ and THR~MAX~ can be chosen to represent
different modem implementations and link conditions. The parameters
proposed in table 1 represent a baseline case, which assumes:

\- 1:1 antenna configurations

\- AWGN channel model

\- Link Adaptation (see table A.X for details of highest and lowest rate
codes)

\- No HARQ

######## Annex B (informative): Smart Antenna Model for UTRA 1.28 Mcps TDD

B.1 Description
---------------

Considering beam forming function of smart antenna, the following five
basic beam forming pattern is provided with their main beam pointing to
0°,30°,45°,60° and 70° respectively. The beam patterns pointing to
-30°,-45°,-60° and -70° can be derived through the image of the above
beam patterns. Thus, we can get nine angles beamforming radioation
pattern. The gain of blow -90 and above 90 is assumed as -∞ by using the
ideal isolation. In the simulation each UE will select the most adjacent
(in angle) beam pattern for signal strength and interference calculation
accroding the the angle calculated from the UE position and BS sector
antenna direction. For example if a UE 's angle to the direction of the
sector is 25^0^, the 30^0^ beam pattern will be selected. Then the
selected beam pattern will be shifted -5^0^, by which the main beam will
pointing the UE. The signal strengh and interference from different
direction will be calculated based on the shifted pattern. The shifted
angle out of \[-90°,90°\] will be transfered inside \[-90°,90°\] by
horizontal imaging.
