5 Services and functions of the physical layer
==============================================

5.1 General
-----------

The physical layer offers data transport services to higher layers.

The access to these services is through the use of transport channels
via the MAC sub-layer.

A transport block is defined as the data delivered by MAC layer to the
physical layer and vice versa. Transport blocks are delivered once every
TTI.

5.2 Overview of L1 functions
----------------------------

The physical layer offers data transport services to higher layers. The
access to these services is through the use of a transport channel via
the MAC sub-layer. The physical layer is expected to perform the
following functions in order to provide the data transport service:

\- Error detection on the transport channel and indication to higher
layers

\- FEC encoding/decoding of the transport channel

\- Hybrid ARQ soft-combining

\- Rate matching of the coded transport channel to physical channels

\- Mapping of the coded transport channel onto physical channels

\- Power weighting of physical channels

\- Modulation and demodulation of physical channels

\- Frequency and time synchronisation

\- Radio characteristics measurements and indication to higher layers

\- Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) antenna processing

\- Transmit Diversity (TX diversity)

\- Beamforming

\- RF processing.

L1 functions are modelled for each transport channel in clauses 6.1, 6.2
and 6.3.

5.3 Void

6 Model of physical layer of the UE
===================================

The E-UTRA physical-layer model captures those characteristics of the
E-UTRA physical-layer that are relevant from the point-of-view of higher
layers. More specifically, the physical-layer model captures:

\- The structure of higher-layer data being passed down to or up from
the physical layer;

\- The means by which higher layers can configure the physical layer;

\- The different indications (error indications, channel-quality
indications, etc.) that are provided by the physical layer to higher
layers;

\- Other (non-transport-channel-based) higher-layer peer-to-peer
signalling supported by the physical layer.

6.1 Uplink model
----------------

### 6.1.1 Uplink Shared Channel

The physical-layer model for Uplink Shared Channel transmission is
described based on the corresponding physical-layer-processing chain,
see Figure 6.1.1-1. Processing steps that are relevant for the
physical-layer model, e.g. in the sense that they are configurable by
higher layers, are highlighted in blue. It should be noted that, in the
cases of PUSCH and NPUSCH, the scheduling decision is fully done at the
network side. The uplink transmission control in the UE then configures
the uplink physical-layer processing, based on uplink transport-format
and resource-assignment information received on the downlink.

**- Higher-layer data passed to/from the physical layer**

\- One transport block of dynamic size delivered to the physical layer
once every TTI.

**- CRC and transport-block-error indication**

\- Transport-block-error indication delivered to higher layers.

**- FEC and rate *matching***

\- Channel coding rate is implicitly given by the combination of
transport block size, modulation scheme and resource assignment;

\- Physical layer model support of HARQ: in case of Incremental
Redundancy, the corresponding Layer 2 Hybrid-ARQ process controls what
redundancy version is to be used for the physical layer transmission for
each TTI.

**- Interleaving**

\- No control of interleaving by higher layers.

**- Data modulation**

\- Modulation scheme is decided by MAC Scheduler (QPSK, 16QAM, 64QAM,
and 256QAM; for BL UEs or UEs in enhanced coverage, supported modulation
schemes are QPSK and 16QAM; for NB-IoT, supported modulation schemes are
Pi/4-QPSK and Pi/2-BPSK for single-tone allocation, and QPSK for
multi-tone allocation).

**- Mapping to physical resource**

\- L2-controlled resource assignment.

**- Multi-antenna processing**

\- MAC Scheduler partly configures mapping from assigned resource blocks
to the available number of antenna ports.

**- Support of L1 control signalling**

\- Transmission of ACK/NACK and CSI feedback related to DL data
transmission

The model of Figure 6.1.1-1 also captures

\- Transport via physical layer of Hybrid-ARQ related information
associated with the PUSCH, to the peer HARQ process at the transmitter
side;

\- Transport via physical layer of corresponding HARQ acknowledgements
to PUSCH transmitter side (except for NB-IoT UEs).

If a UE is configured with one or more SCells, the
physical-layer-processing chain in Figure 6.1.1-1 is repeated for every
UL Serving Cell.

Figure 6.1.1-1: Physical-layer model for UL-SCH transmission

### 6.1.2 Random-access Channel

The physical-layer model for RACH transmission is characterized by a
random access burst that consists of a cyclic prefix, a preamble, and a
guard time during which nothing is transmitted.

The random access preambles are generated from Zadoff-Chu sequences with
zero correlation zone (ZC-ZCZ), generated from one or several root
Zadoff-Chu sequences. For NB-IoT, the random access preambles are
generated from single-subcarrier frequency-hopping symbol groups. A
symbol group consists of a cyclic prefix followed by five identical
symbols, whose value is constant across symbol groups during each NPRACH
transmission.

6.2 Downlink model
------------------

### 6.2.1 Downlink-Shared Channel

The physical-layer model for Downlink Shared Channel transmission is
described based on the corresponding PDSCH or NPDSCH
physical-layer-processing chain, see Figure 6.2.1-1. Processing steps
that are relevant for the physical-layer model, e.g. in the sense that
they are configurable by higher layers, are highlighted in blue on the
figure.

**- Higher-layer data passed to/from the physical layer**

\- N (up to two) transport blocks of dynamic size delivered to the
physical layer once every TTI.

**- CRC and transport-block-error indication**

\- Transport-block-error indication delivered to higher layers.

**- FEC and rate *matching***

\- Channel coding rate is implicitly given by the combination of
transport block size, modulation scheme and resource assignment;

\- Physical layer model support of HARQ: in case of Incremental
Redundancy, the corresponding Layer 2 Hybrid-ARQ process controls what
redundancy version is to be used for the physical layer transmission for
each TTI.

**- Data modulation**

\- Modulation scheme is decided by MAC Scheduler (QPSK, 16QAM, 64 QAM,
256QAM, and 1024QAM; for BL UEs or UEs in enhanced coverage, supported
modulation schemes are QPSK and 16QAM, and 64QAM for CE mode A with no
repetitions; for NB-IoT, only QPSK is supported).

**Multi-antenna processing**

\- MAC Scheduler partly configures mapping from modulated code words
(for each stream) to the available number of antenna ports.

**- Mapping to physical resource**

\- L2-controlled resource assignment.

**- Support of L1 control signalling**

\- Transmission of scheduler related control signals.

**- Support for Hybrid-ARQ-related signalling**

The model of Figure 6.2.1-1 also captures:

\- Transport via physical layer of Hybrid-ARQ related information
associated with the PDSCH, to the peer HARQ process at the receiver
side;

\- Transport via physical layer of corresponding HARQ acknowledgements
to PDSCH transmitter side.

If a UE is configured with one or more SCells, the
physical-layer-processing chain in Figure 6.2.1-1 is repeated for every
DL Serving Cell.

NOTE: The signalling of transport-format and resource-allocation is not
captured in the physical-layer model. At the transmitter side, this
information can be directly derived from the configuration of the
physical layer. The physical layer then transports this information over
the radio interface to its peer physical layer, presumably multiplexed
in one way or another with the HARQ-related information. On the receiver
side, this information is, in contrast to the HARQ-related information,
used directly within the physical layer for PDSCH demodulation, decoding
etc., without passing through higher layers.

Figure 6.2.1-1: Physical-layer model for DL-SCH transmission

### 6.2.2 Broadcast Channel

The physical-layer model for BCH transmission is characterized by a
fixed pre-defined transport format. The TTI (repetition rate) of the BCH
is 40 ms except for NB-IoT and 640 ms for NB-IoT. The BCH physical-layer
model is described based on the corresponding BCH
physical-layer-processing chain, see Figure 6.2.2-1:

\- **Higher-layer data passed to/from the physical layer**

\- A single (fixed-size) transport block per TTI.

\- **CRC and transport-block-error indication**

\- Transport-block-error indication delivered to higher layers.

\- **FEC and rate *matching***

\- Channel coding rate is implicitly given by the combination of
transport block size, modulation scheme and resource assignment;

\- No BCH Hybrid ARQ, i.e. no higher-layer control of redundancy
version.

\- **Data modulation**

Figure 6.2.2-1: Physical-layer model for BCH transmission

NOTE: For NB-IoT, the BCH transport block of 40 bits is truncated to 34
bits by the NodeB when provided to the physical layer for BCH
transmission. The BCH transport block of 34 bits is padded to 40 bits
when delivered by the UE physical layer to the upper layer.

### 6.2.3 Paging Channel

The physical-layer model for PCH transmission is described based on the
corresponding PCH physical-layer-processing chain, see Figure 6.2.3-1.
Processing steps that are relevant for the physical-layer model, e.g. in
the sense that they are configurable by higher layers, are highlighted
in blue on the figure.

Figure 6.2.3-1: Physical-layer model for PCH transmission

### 6.2.4 Multicast Channel

The physical-layer model for MCH transmission is characterized by the
support for multi-cell reception at the UE (a.k.a. \"MBSFN\"
transmission). This implies that only semi-static configuration of the
MCH transport format and resource assignment is possible. The MCH
physical-layer model is described based on the corresponding MCH
physical-layer-processing chain, see Figure 6.2.4-1. Processing steps
that are relevant for the physical-layer model, e.g. in the sense that
they are configurable by higher layers, are highlighted in blue.

\- **Higher-layer data passed to/from the physical layer**

\- One transport block delivered to physical layer once every TTI.

\- **CRC and transport-block-error indication**

\- Transport-block-error indication delivered to higher layers.

Figure 6.2.4-1: Physical-layer model for MCH transmission

6.3 Sidelink model
------------------

### 6.3.1 Sidelink Broadcast Channel

The physical-layer model for Sidelink Broadcast Channel transmission is
characterized by a fixed pre-defined transport format. The TTI
(repetition rate) of the SL-BCH not corresponding to V2X sidelink
communication is 40ms whereas the TTI (repetition rate) of the SL-BCH
corresponding to V2X sidelink communication is 160 ms, if a UE is
configured to transmit on SL-BCH. The SL-BCH physical-layer model is
described based on the corresponding SL-BCH physical-layer-processing
chain, see Figure 6.3.1-1.

\- **Higher-layer data passed to/from the physical layer**

\- A single (fixed-size) transport block per TTI.

\- **CRC and transport-block-error indication**

\- Transport-block-error indication delivered to higher layers.

Figure 6.3.1-1: Physical-layer model for SL-BCH transmission

### 6.3.2 Sidelink Discovery Channel

The physical-layer model for Sidelink Discovery Channel transmission is
characterized by a fixed pre-defined transport format. The SL-DCH
physical-layer model is described based on the corresponding SL-DCH
physical-layer-processing chain, see Figure 6.3.2-1. Processing steps
that are relevant for the physical-layer model, e.g. in the sense that
they are configurable by higher layers, are highlighted in blue. It
should be noted that, in case scheduled resource allocation of SL-DCH,
the scheduling decision is fully done by network side. The sidelink
transmission control in the UE configures the sidelink physical-layer
processing, based on sidelink transport-format and resource-assignment
information received on the downlink. In case UE autonomous resource
selection of SL-DCH, the scheduling decision is done by UE side. The
sidelink transmission control in the UE configures the sidelink
physical-layer processing, based on pre-defined sidelink
transport-format and UE randomly selected resource-assignment.

### 6.3.3 Sidelink Shared Channel

The physical-layer model for Sidelink Shared Channel transmission is
described based on the corresponding SL-SCH physical-layer-processing
chain, see Figure 6.3.3-1. Processing steps that are relevant for the
physical-layer model, e.g. in the sense that they are configurable by
higher layers, are highlighted in blue on the figure. It should be noted
that, in case of scheduled resource allocation, the SL-SCH scheduling
decision is done by network side. The sidelink transmission control in
the UE configures the sidelink physical-layer processing, based on
sidelink transport-format and resource-assignment information received
on the downlink. In case of UE autonomous resource selection, the SL-SCH
scheduling decision is done by UE side, and the MAC scheduler in the UE
configures the sidelink physical-layer processing, based on the sidelink
transport-format autonomously decided by the UE and autonomously
selected resource-assignment.

**- Higher-layer data passed to/from the physical layer**

\- One transport block of dynamic size delivered to the physical layer
once every TTI.

**- CRC and transport-block-error indication**

\- Transport-block-error indication delivered to higher layers.

**- FEC and rate matching**

\- Channel coding rate is implicitly given by the combination of
transport block size, modulation scheme and resource assignment;

\- Support for soft combining, but no support for ACK/NACK feedback.

transmitter UE. For UE autonomous resource selection for V2X sidelink
communication, modulation scheme is decided by MAC scheduler (QPSK,
16QAM, 64QAM) in transmitter UE.

\- For UE autonomous resource selection for V2X sidelink communication,
modulation scheme is decided by MAC scheduler in transmitter UE,
according to the range defined by higher layer signalling from eNB or
preconfiguration if configured.

**- Mapping to physical resource**

\- L2-controlled resource assignment.

**- Multi-antenna processing**

\- Single antenna port is used.

Figure 6.3.3-1: Physical-layer model for SL-SCH transmission

NOTE: For UE autonomous resource selection for V2X sidelink
communication, the MAC scheduler in the transmitter UE decides whether
to use 64QAM for data modulation based on UE capability, see TS 36.306
\[13\].
