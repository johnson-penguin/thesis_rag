4 Introduction
==============

4.1 General
-----------

The main aspects of the LTE-based 5G terrestrial broadcast described in
this specification are:

\- radio network comprising only MBMS-dedicated cells or
FeMBMS/Unicast-mixed cells \[3\] as transmitters; and

\- ROM devices and UEs supporting FeMBMS \[4\] as receivers.

NOTE: ROM devices support only ROM service \[5\]. ROM service uses one
of the reserved TMGI values \[7\].

MBMS-dedicated cells support only MBMS transmission and do not support
uplink transmission. MBSFN subframes of a MBMS-dedicated cell do not
have a control region and can therefore be 100% allocated to MBMS.
Non-MBSFN subframes, also called Cell Acquisition Subframes (CAS), which
contain the control region, are used for transmission of the system
acquisition signals (PSS/SSS), PDCCH, and system information on PBCH and
PDSCH. CAS are transmitted with a periodicity of 40ms and use subframes
with *∆f* = 15 kHz![](media/image3.png)![](media/image4.png). PBCH of a
MBMS-dedicated cell uses a different scrambling sequence initialization
than PBCH of a non-MBMS-dedicated cell, which prevents UEs that do not
support MBMS-dedicated cell from camping on it. For more information
about MBMS-dedicated cell see TS 36.300 \[3\].

Multicast data is transmitted over PMCH. PMCH supports SFN transmission,
where multiple eNBs synchronously transmit the same waveform. Multiple
numerologies are supported for PMCH (see Clause 6.1), tailored for
different scenarios (e.g. support of different mobility and ISD). A
single cell can belong to multiple (up to 8) SFN areas, where different
SFN areas may have different numerologies. The PMCH carries the MCCH and
MTCH logical channels. The MCCH provides scheduling information for
multicast data over the MTCH. The MTCH contains user plane data. MCCH
scheduling information is provided in system information.

ROM devices support MBMS reception but do not support uplink
transmission. ROM devices may not have USIM. As such, ROM devices do not
support two-way signalling procedures with the network, including
connection establishment procedures and security procedures. ROM devices
only support the idle mode. Not all idle mode procedures are supported,
as described in clause 7.3. For more details on ROM devices see
clause 7, TS 36.300 \[3\] clause 15.11, TS 23.246 \[4\] Annex D and
TS 24.116 \[7\] clause 4.

NOTE 1: As a matter of implementation, a cellular device can host a ROM
device and a traditional UE capable of unicast. Such device is further
described in TS 36.246 \[4\] Annex E and called *ROM device with
independent unicast*. The co-hosted UE is connected to a different cell
from the MBMS-dedicated cell serving the co-hosted ROM device. If the
co-hosted UE and ROM device share baseband resources, the co-hosted UE
can use *MBMSInterestIndication* signalling procedure, specified in TS
36.331 \[6\], to inform the serving RAN about the baseband resources
occupied by the co-hosted ROM device and therefore not available for
unicast.

NOTE 2: There may be awareness at the application layer of the ROM
device with independent unicast. How this awareness is created is
outside of the scope of specifications.

4.2 Use cases and requirements
------------------------------

In Release 14, the use cases and scenarios for eMBMS services based on
LTE have been expanded to include terrestrial broadcasting (the feature
also referred to as \"EnTV\"). This included new requirements:

\- network dedicated to TV broadcast via eMBMS;

\- SFN deployments with ISD significantly larger than a typical ISD
associated with typical cellular deployments;

\- support for ROM device.

NOTE: At the upper layers, the requirements included the support for
Free to Air service \[2\] and for eMBMS network sharing \[4\].

In Release 16, a gap analysis documented in TR 36.776 \[9\] compared the
Release 14 LTE terrestrial broadcasting capabilities with the
requirements for 5G dedicated broadcast networks in TR 38.913 \[10\]. As
a result of this analysis, the following two requirements were deemed
unfulfilled by Release 14 LTE eMBMS:

1\. Support for service over large geographic area, including SFN with
ISD \> 100km;

2\. Support for mobility scenarios including speeds of up to 250 km/h.

In relation to the first requirement, the new ISD of 125 km, referred to
as HPHT network, with omni-directional transmitters was defined. The
following two ISD were also included in the evaluation:

\- 15 km, referred to as LPLT network with sectorized cells;

\- 50 km, referred to as MPMT network with omni-directional
transmitters.

The first requirement is associated with receivers with high-gain
rooftop directional antennas, low mobility and a predominantly
line-of-sight channel.

The second requirement is associated with receivers in cars, with
external omni-directional antennas.

In addition to the above two requirements, a third requirement was added
related to improving the CAS reception for both large ISD and high
mobility scenarios.

4.3 Enhancements targeting LTE terrestrial broadcast
----------------------------------------------------

In Release 14, the following key RAN enhancements were made to the
specifications to enable LTE terrestrial broadcast:

\- MBMS-dedicated cell \[3\];

5 Architecture
==============

The network architecture for LTE-based 5G terrestrial broadcast is
described in TS 36.300 \[3\] clause 15.1.1, with the exception that
only:

\- ROM reception via MBMS-dedicated cell; or

\- MBMS reception via FeMBMS/Unicast-mixed cell

is supported.

RAN interfaces for LTE-based 5G terrestrial broadcast are described in
TS 36.300 \[3\] clause 15.1.1 and in TS 36.440 \[11\]. In case of a
MBMS-dedicated cell, the counting procedure is not supported by the eNB.

User plane and control plane protocol stack for LTE-based 5G terrestrial
broadcast is described in TS 36.300 \[3\] clause 15.1.2 and
clause 15.1.3, respectively.

NOTE: For upper layer architecture, see TS 23.246 \[4\].

6 Protocol aspects
==================

6.1 Frame structure and numerologies
------------------------------------

Only frame structure type 1 is supported. All numerologies specified in
TS 36.211 \[8\] are supported. For subframes using *∆f* other than 0.370
kHz, the frame structure is according to Figure 6.1-1. For transmissions
using *∆f* = 0.370 kHz, the frame structure is shown in Figure 6.1-2.

Figure 6.1-1: Frame structure type 1 for subframes not using *∆f* =
0.370 kHz For *∆f* = 1.25 kHz, one subframe contains a single slot with
a duration of 1ms.

Figure 6.1-2: Frame structure type 1 for transmissions using *∆f* =
0.370 kHz. The CAS is a non-MBSFN subframe, and is configured with 15
kHz subcarrier spacing

Table 6.1 summarizes the supported numerologies for MBMS transmission
over PMCH. The theoretical equalization interval is obtained as the
maximum channel delay spread that can be estimated from the pilot
pattern, and is equal to the Symbol duration (excluding CP) divided by
the frequency separation (in number of subcarriers) between two
consecutive pilot tones.

6.2 MBMS Transmission
---------------------

MBMS transmission is performed according to TS 36.300 \[3\] clause
15.3.3.

MCCH configuration and scheduling is performed according to
TS 36.300 \[3\] clause 15.3.5 and TS 36.331 \[6\] clause 5.8.1. In case
of a MBMS-dedicated cell, the MBMS counting configuration is not
supported.

MCCH information acquisition is performed according to
TS 36.300 \[3\] clause 15.3.5 and TS 36.331 \[6\] clause 5.8.2. In case
of a MBMS-dedicated cell, only RRC\_IDLE is supported.

6.3 MAC Layer
-------------

MAC layer supports only:

\- BCH reception for BCCH;

\- DL-SCH reception for BCCH; and

\- MCH reception for MCCH/MTCH.

BCH reception and DL-SCH reception in the MAC layer use transparent MAC
\[16\], i.e. single MAC PDU per TTI with no headers. HARQ entity uses
the dedicated broadcast HARQ process, defined in \[16\].

MCH reception in the MAC layer is specified in TS 36.321 \[16\]
clause 5.12 and in TS 36.300 \[3\] clause 15.3.3.

6.4 RLC layer
-------------

BCCH uses the RLC-TM mode.

MTCH and MCCH use the RLC-UM mode. RLC operation for MTCH and MCCH is
described in TS 36.300 \[3\] clause 15.3.3.

class is supported;*

*- acquisition of system information messages is performed according to*
TS 36.331 \[6\] clause 5.2.3b.

For MBMS reception, the following applies:

\- MBMS counting procedure and MBMS interest indication procedure are
not supported.

7 ROM aspects 
=============

7.1 General
-----------

Since a ROM device does not support uplink transmission or two-way
signalling procedures, and does not comprise USIM, it cannot support all
the physical layer procedures of the conventional UE. By the same token,
only a subset of idle mode procedures and RRM requirements applicable to
a conventional UE will be supported. The following clauses provide an
overview of the physical layer and idle mode procedures and the RRM
requirements applicable to a ROM device.

7.2 Physical layer procedures
-----------------------------

ROM device only supports the following physical layer procedures
specified in TS 36.213 \[13\]:

\- Cell search;

\- Timing synchronization;

\- PDSCH procedures;

\- PDCCH assignment procedure;

\- PMCH procedures; and

\- Assumptions independent on physical channels (clause 12) related to
MBMS-dedicated cell.

7.3 Idle mode procedures
------------------------

ROM device only supports the following idle mode procedures specified in
TS 36.304 \[14\]:

\- Cell selection; and

\- Cell reselection.

PLMN prioritization for cell reselection is specified in
TS 36.304 \[14\] clause 5.2.4.1.

NOTE: NAS layer PLMN selection does not apply to ROM device. PLMN
selection for ROM device is specified in TS 24.116 \[7\].

ROM device does not support DRX.

7.4 RRM requirements
--------------------

ROM device only supports the following requirements specified in
TS 36.133 \[15\]:

\- Cell selection; and

\- Cell reselection, except for:

\- IRAT reselection;

\- paging-related requirements; and

\- CSG cell-related requirements.

Appendix Upper layer aspects
============================

LTE-based 5G terrestrial broadcast supports *transparent delivery*,
which allows for broadcasting of IP-based services for which the media
codecs and application protocols are defined outside 3GPP (see clause
8B, TS 26.346 \[5\]).

Broadcast service announcement and session management are defined in
clause 4.4.3, TS 23.246 \[4\].

ROM devices are defined in clause 7, TS 36.300 \[3\] clause 15.11,
TS 23.246 \[4\] Annex D and TS 24.116 \[7\] clause 4.
