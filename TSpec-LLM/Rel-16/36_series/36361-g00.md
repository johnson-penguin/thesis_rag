4 General
=========

4.1 Introduction
----------------

The objective is to describe the use of encapsulation for IP packets
over the LWIP Tunnel as defined in TS 36.300 \[2\] and TS 36.331 \[3\].

4.2 LWIPEP architecture
-----------------------

### 4.2.1 LWIPEP entities

The description in this sub clause is a model and does not specify or
restrict implementations.

RRC is in control of the LWIPEP configuration.

Functions of the LWIPEP sublayer are performed by LWIPEP entities. For
an LWIPEP entity configured at the eNB, there is a peer LWIPEP entity
configured at the UE and vice versa. The LWIPEP entity responsible for
encapsulating LWIPEP SDUs is referred to as the transmitter. The LWIPEP
entity responsible for decapsulating LWIPEP PDUs is referred to as the
receiver.

An LWIPEP entity receives/delivers LWIPEP SDUs from/to upper layers
(i.e. IP) and sends/receives LWIPEP PDUs to/from its peer LWIPEP entity
via an LWIP Tunnel and E-UTRA.

\- At the transmitting side, when an LWIPEP entity receives an LWIPEP
SDU from upper layers, it constructs the corresponding LWIPEP PDU and
delivers it to lower layers;

\- At the receiving side, when an LWIPEP entity receives an LWIPEP PDU
from lower layers, it reassembles the corresponding LWIPEP SDU and
delivers it to upper layers.

Figure 4.2.1-1 illustrates the overview model of the LWIPEP sublayer.

Figure 4.2.1-1: Overview model of the LWIPEP sublayer

An LWIPEP entity delivers/receives the following LWIPEP PDU to/from a
lower layer entity:

\- LWIPEP data PDU.

4.3 Services
------------

### 4.3.1 Services provided to upper layers

The following services are provided by LWIPEP to upper layers (i.e. IP):

\- transfer of user plane data;

### 4.3.2 Services expected from lower layers

The following services are expected by LWIPEP from lower layers (i.e.
LWIP Tunnel and E-UTRA):

\- transfer of user plane data;

4.4 Functions
-------------

The following functions are supported by the LWIPEP sublayer:

\- transfer of user plane data;

\- identification of the DRB identity to which the LWIPEP SDU belongs.

5 Procedures
============

5.1 Data transfer procedures
----------------------------

### **5.1.1 UL data transfer procedures**

**When receiving an** LWIPEP **SDU from upper layers, the** LWIPEP
**entity shall form the LWIPEP PDU as described in Section 6.1.**

### **5.1.2 DL data transfer procedures**

**When receiving an** LWIPEP **PDU from lower layers, the** LWIPEP
**entity shall:**

\- if configured by upper layers to enable aggregation in DL:

\- **interpret the LWIPEP PDU as having both *Key* and *Sequence Number*
fields included as described in Section 6.1;**

\- **reorder received packets according to the *Sequence Number* field
before delivering them to higher layers as specified in** RFC 2890
\[5\];

\- else:

\- interpret the LWIPEP PDU as having *Key* field included as described
in Section 6.1;

5.2 Handling of unknown, unforeseen and erroneous protocol data
---------------------------------------------------------------

When an LWIPEP entity receives an LWIPEP PDU that contains reserved or
invalid values, the LWIPEP entity shall:

\- discard the received PDU.

6 Protocol data units, formats and parameters
=============================================

6.1 Protocol data units
-----------------------

### 6.1.1 General

An LWIPEP PDU is a bit string that is byte aligned (i.e. multiple of 8
bits) in length. In the figures in subclause 6.1, bit strings are
represented by tables in which the most significant bit is the leftmost
bit of the first line of the table, the least significant bit is the
rightmost bit on the last line of the table, and more generally the bit
string is to be read from left to right and then in the reading order of
the lines. The bit order of each parameter field within an LWIPEP PDU is
represented with the first and most significant bit in the leftmost bit
and the last and least significant bit in the rightmost bit.

An LWIPEP SDU is a bit string that is byte aligned (i.e. multiple of 8
bits) in length. An LWIPEP SDU is included into an LWIPEP PDU from the
first bit onward.

Only one type of LWIPEP PDU is defined, i.e. LWIPEP data PDU.

### 6.1.2 LWIPEP data PDU

An LWIPEP data PDU consists of the LWIPEP header and the LWIPEP SDU, as
described in Figure 6.1.2-1. The LWIPEP header is populated as described
in 6.2.1.

Figure 6.1.2-1: LWIPEP data PDU

6.2 Formats and parameters
--------------------------

### 6.2.1 LWIPEP header

The LWIPEP Header is a GRE header as specified in RFC 2890 \[5\] and has
a fixed size of eight bytes (if only the *Key* field is included) or
twelve bytes (if both the *Key* and *Sequence Number* fields are
included).

The transmitter shall set the 5 LSB\'s of the *Key* field in the GRE
header to the DRB Identity associated with the LWIPEP SDU and set the
remaining MSB\'s to \'0\'. If instructed by RRC to enable aggregation in
UL or DL, the transmitter shall in addition include the *Sequence
Number* field as specified by RFC 2890 \[5\] in the LWIPEP header. All
other optional fields are unused, and the values of other fields shall
be set as specified in RFC 2784 \[4\] and RFC 2890 \[5\].
