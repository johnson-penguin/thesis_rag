Foreword
========

This Technical Specification has been produced by the 3^rd^ Generation
Partnership Project (3GPP).

The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work
within the TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the
TSG modify the contents of the present document, it will be re-released
by the TSG with an identifying change of release date and an increase in
version number as follows:

Version x.y.z

where:

x the first digit:

1 presented to TSG for information;

2 presented to TSG for approval;

3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.

y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e.
technical enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.

z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been
incorporated in the document.

1 Scope
=======

The present document specifies the standards allowed to implement layer
1 on the SLm interface.

The specification of transmission delay requirements and O&M
requirements are not in the scope of the present document.

In the following, \'layer 1\' and \'physical layer\' are assumed to be
synonymous.

2 References
============

The following documents contain provisions which, through reference in
this text, constitute provisions of the present document.

\- References are either specific (identified by date of publication,
edition number, version number, etc.) or non‑specific.

\- For a specific reference, subsequent revisions do not apply.

\- For a non-specific reference, the latest version applies. In the case
of a reference to a 3GPP document (including a GSM document), a
non-specific reference implicitly refers to the latest version of that
document *in the same Release as the present document*.

4 Introduction
==============

The main functions of layer 1 are summarized in the following:

\- Interface to physical medium;

\- Frame delineation;

\- Line clock extraction capability;

\- Layer 1 alarms extraction and generation;

\- Transmission quality control.

5 Layer 1 specifications
========================

The support of any suitable layer 1 technique - like point-to-point or
point-to-multipoint techniques - shall not be prevented.

6 Interface to management plane
===============================

The description of the interface towards the management plane is out of
scope of this document, but at least the following O&M functions should
be foreseen:

\- Performance monitoring functions;

\- Alarm status reporting functions;

\- Synchronisation source management.
