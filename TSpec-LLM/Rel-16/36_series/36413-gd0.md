3 Definitions and abbreviations
===============================

3.1 Definitions
---------------

For the purposes of the present document, the terms and definitions
given in TR 21.905 \[1\] and the following apply.\
A term defined in the present document takes precedence over the
definition of the same term, if any, in TR 21.905 \[1\].

**ACL functionality:** A functionality controlling the access to network
nodes. In case of Access Control Lists (ACL) functionality is applied in
a network node the network node may only accept connections from other
peer network nodes once the source addresses of the sending network node
is already known in the target node.

**CSG Cell**: an E-UTRAN cell broadcasting a CSG indicator set to true
and a CSG identity. This cell operates in Closed Access Mode as defined
in TS 22.220 \[28\].

**DAPS Handover**: as defined in TS 36.300 \[14\].

**DCN-ID:** DCN identity identifies a specific decicated core network
(DCN).

**Dual Connectivity**: as defined in TS 36.300 \[14\].

**Elementary Procedure:** S1AP consists of Elementary Procedures (EPs).
An Elementary Procedure is a unit of interaction between eNBs and the
EPC. These Elementary Procedures are defined separately and are intended
to be used to build up complete sequences in a flexible manner. If the
independence between some EPs is restricted, it is described under the
relevant EP description. Unless otherwise stated by the restrictions,
the EPs may be invoked independently of each other as standalone
procedures, which can be active in parallel. The usage of several S1AP
EPs together or together with EPs from other interfaces is specified in
stage 2 specifications (e.g., TS 23.401 \[11\] and TS 36.300 \[14\]).

An EP consists of an initiating message and possibly a response message.
Two kinds of EPs are used:

\- **Class 1:** Elementary Procedures with response (success and/or
failure).

\- **Class 2:** Elementary Procedures without response.

For Class 1 EPs, the types of responses can be as follows:

Successful:

\- A signalling message explicitly indicates that the elementary
procedure successfully completed with the receipt of the response.

Unsuccessful:

\- A signalling message explicitly indicates that the EP failed.

\- On time supervision expiry (i.e., absence of expected response).

Successful and Unsuccessful:

\- One signalling message reports both successful and unsuccessful
outcome for the different included requests. The response message used
is the one defined for successful outcome.

Class 2 EPs are considered always successful.

**eNB UE S1AP ID:** as defined in TS 36.401 \[2\].

**Hybrid Cell**: an E-UTRAN cell broadcasting a CSG indicator set to
false and a CSG identity. This cell operates in Hybrid Access Mode as
defined in TS 22.220 \[28\].

**MME UE S1AP ID:** as defined in TS 36.401 \[2\].

**E-RAB: as defined in** TS 36.401 \[2\].

NOTE 1: The E-RAB is either a default E-RAB or a dedicated E-RAB.

**E-RAB ID**: the E-RAB ID uniquely identifies an E-RAB for one UE.

NOTE 2: The E-RAB ID remains unique for the UE even if the UE-associated
logical S1-connection is released during periods of user inactivity.

**Data Radio Bearer**: the Data Radio bearer transports the packets of
an E-RAB between a UE and an eNB. There is a one-to-one mapping between
the E-RAB and the Data Radio Bearer.

**Secondary Cell Group**: as defined in TS 36.300 \[14\].

**UE-associated signalling:** When S1-AP messages associated to one UE
uses the UE-associated logical S1-connection for association of the
message to the UE in eNB and EPC.

**UE-associated logical S1-connection: The UE-associated logical
S1-connection uses the identities *MME UE S1AP ID*** and ***eNB UE S1AP
ID*** according to definition in TS **23.401 \[11\]. For a received UE
associated S1-AP message the** MME identifies **the** associated UE
based on the ***MME UE S1AP ID*** IE and **the** eNB identifies **the**
associated UE based on the ***eNB UE S1AP ID*** IE*.* **The
UE-associated logical S1-connection may exist before the S1 UE context
is setup in eNB.**

4 General
=========

4.1 Procedure Specification Principles
--------------------------------------

The principle for specifying the procedure logic is to specify the
functional behaviour of the terminating node exactly and completely. Any
rule that specifies the behaviour of the originating node shall be
possible to be verified with information that is visible within the
system.

The following specification principles have been applied for the
procedure text in clause 8:

\- The procedure text discriminates between:

1\) Functionality which "shall" be executed

The procedure text indicates that the receiving node "shall" perform a
certain function Y under a certain condition. If the receiving node
supports procedure X but cannot perform functionality Y requested in the
REQUEST message of a Class 1 EP, the receiving node shall respond with
the message used to report unsuccessful outcome for this procedure,
containing an appropriate cause value.

2\) Functionality which "shall, if supported" be executed

The procedure text indicates that the receiving node "shall, if
supported," perform a certain function Y under a certain condition. If
the receiving node supports procedure X, but does not support
functionality Y, the receiving node shall proceed with the execution of
the EP, possibly informing the requesting node about the not supported
functionality.

\- Any required inclusion of an optional IE in a response message is
explicitly indicated in the procedure text. If the procedure text does
not explicitly indicate that an optional IE shall be included in a
response message, the optional IE shall not be included. For
requirements on including *Criticality Diagnostics* IE, see clause 10.

4.2 Forwards and Backwards Compatibility
----------------------------------------

The forwards and backwards compatibility of the protocol is assured by
mechanism where all current and future messages, and IEs or groups of
related IEs, include ID and criticality fields that are coded in a
standard format that will not be changed in the future. These parts can
always be decoded regardless of the standard version.

4.3 Specification Notations
---------------------------

For the purposes of the present document, the following notations apply:

Procedure When referring to an elementary procedure in the specification
the Procedure Name is written with the first letters in each word in
upper case characters followed by the word "procedure", e.g., E-RAB
procedure.

Message When referring to a message in the specification the MESSAGE
NAME is written with all letters in upper case characters followed by
the word "message", e.g., MESSAGE NAME message.

IE When referring to an information element (IE) in the specification
the *Information Element Name* is written with the first letters in each
word in upper case characters and all letters in Italic font followed by
the abbreviation "IE", e.g., *Information Element* IE.

Value of an IE When referring to the value of an information element
(IE) in the specification the "Value" is written as it is specified in
subclause 9.2 enclosed by quotation marks, e.g., "Value".

 5 S1AP Services
===============

S1AP provides the signalling service between E-UTRAN and the evolved
packet core (EPC) that is required to fulfil the S1AP functions
described in clause 7. S1AP services are divided into two groups:

> Non UE-associated services: They are related to the whole S1 interface
> instance between the eNB and MME utilising a non UE-associated
> signalling connection.
>
> UE-associated services: They are related to one UE. S1AP functions
> that provide these services are associated with a UE-associated
> signalling connection that is maintained for the UE in question.

 6 Services Expected from Signalling Transport
=============================================

The signalling connection shall provide in sequence delivery of S1AP
messages. S1AP shall be notified if the signalling connection breaks.

 7 Functions of S1AP
===================

The S1AP protocol has the following functions:

\- E-RAB management function: This overall functionality is responsible
for setting up, modifying and releasing E-RABs, which are triggered by
the MME. The release and modification of E-RABs may be triggered by the
eNB as well.

\- Initial Context Transfer function: This functionality is used to
establish an S1UE context in the eNB, to setup the default IP
connectivity, to setup one or more E-RAB(s) if requested by the MME, and
to transfer NAS signalling related information to the eNB if needed.

\- UE Capability Info Indication function: This functionality is used to
provide the UE Capability Info when received from the UE to the MME.

\- Mobility Functions for UEs in LTE\_ACTIVE in order to enable

\- a change of eNBs within SAE/LTE (Inter MME/Serving SAE-GW Handovers)
via the S1 interface (with EPC involvement).

\- a change of RAN nodes between different RATs (Inter-3GPP-RAT
Handovers) via the S1 interface (with EPC involvement).

\- Paging: This functionality provides the EPC with the capability to
page the UE.

\- S1 interface management functions comprise the:

\- Reset functionality to ensure a well defined initialisation on the S1
interface.

\- Error Indication functionality to allow a proper error
reporting/handling in cases where no failure messages are defined.

\- Overload function to indicate the load situation in the control plane
of the S1 interface.

\- Load balancing function to ensure equally loaded MMEs within an MME
pool area

\- S1 Setup functionality for initial S1 interface setup for providing
configuration information

\- eNB and MME Configuration Update functions are to update application
level configuration data needed for the eNB and MME to interoperate
correctly on the S1 interface.

\- NAS Signalling transport function between the UE and the MME is used:

\- to transfer and reroute NAS signalling related information and to
establish the S1 UE context in the eNB.

\- to transfer NAS signalling related information when the S1 UE context
in the eNB is already established.

\- S1 UE context Release function: This functionality is responsible to
manage the release of UE specific context in the eNB and the MME.

\- UE Context Modification function: This functionality allows to modify
the established UE Context partly.

\- UE Context Resumption function: This functionality allows keeping the
UE Context in the eNB for a UE in RRC\_IDLE that has been enabled to use
User Plane EPS Optimization (see TS 23.401 \[11\]) and to resume the RRC
connection without the need to re-establish the UE Context.

\- Status Transfer: This functionality transfers PDCP SN Status
information from source eNB to target eNB in support of in-sequence
delivery and duplication avoidance for intra LTE handover.

\- Trace function: This functionality is to control a trace session
recording for a UE in ECM\_CONNECTED or to control an MDT session
transferring MDT measurements collected by the UE.

\- Location Reporting: This functionality allows MME to be aware of the
UE's current location.

\- LPPa Signalling transport: This functionality transfers LPPa messages
between eNB and E-SMLC over the S1 interface.

\- S1 CDMA2000 Tunnelling function: This functionality is to carry
CDMA2000 signalling between UE and CDMA2000 RAT over the S1 Interface.

\- Warning message transmission function:\
This functionality provides the means to start and overwrite the
broadcasting of warning message.

\- RAN Information Management (RIM) function: This functionality allows
the request and transfer of RAN information (e.g., GERAN system
information) between two RAN nodes via the core network.

\- Configuration Transfer function: This functionality allows the
request and transfer of RAN configuration information (e.g., SON
information) between two RAN nodes via the core network.

\- UE Radio Capability Match function. The functionality enables the eNB
to derive and provide an indication to the MME whether the UE radio
capabilities are compatible with the network configuration for voice
continuity.

\- PWS Restart Indication function. The functionality enables the eNB to
inform the MME that PWS information for some or all cells of the eNB are
available for reloading from the CBC if needed.

\- PWS Failure Indication function. The functionality enables the eNB to
inform the MME that ongoing PWS operation for one or more cells of the
eNB has failed.

\- Connection Establishment Indication function. The functionality
enables the MME to complete the establishment of the UE-associated
logical S1-connection.

\- Retrieve UE Information function. The functionality enables the eNB
to request UE information from the MME.

\- UE Information Transfer function. The functionality enables the MME
to transfer UE information to the eNB.

\- CP Relocation function. The functionality enables the initiation of
the UE-associated logical S1-connection for a NB-IOT UE using Control
Plane CIoT EPS Optimisation following a re-establishment request.

\- Report of Secondary RAT data volumes function. The functionality
enables the eNB to report Secondary RAT data usage information in case
of EN-DC as specified in TS 23.401 \[11\].

\- QMC function. The functionality enables the eNB to collect QoE
measurements from the UE.

8.2 E-RAB Management procedures
-------------------------------

### 8.2.1 E-RAB Setup

#### 8.2.1.1 General

The purpose of the E-RAB Setup procedure is to assign resources on Uu
and S1 for one or several E-RABs and to setup corresponding Data Radio
Bearers for a given UE. The procedure uses UE-associated signalling.

#### 8.2.1.2 Successful Operation

Figure 8.2.1.2-1: E-RAB Setup procedure. Successful operation.

The MME initiates the procedure by sending an E-RAB SETUP REQUEST
message to the eNB.

\- The E-RAB SETUP REQUEST message shall contain the information
required by the eNB to build the E-RAB configuration consisting of at
least one E-RAB and for each E-RAB to setup include an *E-RAB to be
Setup Item* IE.

Upon reception of the E-RAB SETUP REQUEST message, and if resources are
available for the requested configuration, the eNB shall execute the
requested E-RAB configuration. For each E-RAB and based on the *E-RAB
level QoS parameters* IE the eNB shall establish a Data Radio Bearer and
allocate the required resources on Uu. The eNB shall pass the *NAS-PDU*
IE and the value contained in the *E-RAB ID* IE received for the E-RAB
for each established Data Radio Bearer to the UE. The eNB does not send
the NAS PDUs associated to the failed Data radio bearers to the UE. The
eNB shall allocate the required resources on S1 for the E-RABs requested
to be established.

If the *Correlation ID* IE is included in the E-RAB SETUP REQUEST
message towards the eNB with L-GW function for LIPA operation, then the
eNB shall use this information for LIPA operation for the concerned
E-RAB.

If the *SIPTO Correlation ID* IE is included in the E-RAB SETUP REQUEST
message towards the eNB with L-GW function for SIPTO\@LN operation, then
the eNB shall use this information for SIPTO\@LN operation for the
concerned E-RAB.

If the *Bearer Type* IE is included in the E-RAB SETUP REQUEST message
and is set to \"non IP\", then the eNB shall not perform IP header
compression for the concerned E-RAB.

If the *Ethernet Type* IE is included in the E-RAB SETUP REQUEST message
and is set to \"True\", then the eNB shall, if supported, take this into
account to perform header compression appropriately for the concerned
E-RAB.

The E-RAB SETUP REQUEST message may contain

\- the UE Aggregate Maximum Bit Rate IE.

If the *UE Aggregate Maximum Bit Rate* IE is included in the E-RAB SETUP
REQUEST the eNB shall

\- replace the previously provided UE Aggregate Maximum Bit Rate by the
received UE Aggregate Maximum Bit Rate in the UE context;

\- use the received UE Aggregate Maximum Bit Rate for non-GBR Bearers
for the concerned UE.

If the *UE* *Aggregate Maximum Bit Rate* IE is not contained in the
E-RAB SETUP REQUEST message, the eNB shall use the previously provided
UE Aggregate Maximum Bit Rate which is stored in the UE context.

The eNB shall establish or modify the resources according to the values
of the *Allocation and Retention Priority* IE (priority level and
pre-emption indicators) and the resource situation as follows:

\- The eNB shall consider the priority level of the requested E-RAB,
when deciding on the resource allocation.

\- The priority levels and the pre-emption indicators may (individually
or in combination) be used to determine whether the E-RAB setup has to
be performed unconditionally and immediately. If the requested E-RAB is
marked as "may trigger pre-emption" and the resource situation requires
so, the eNB may trigger the pre-emption procedure which may then cause
the forced release of a lower priority E-RAB which is marked as
"pre-emptable". Whilst the process and the extent of the pre-emption
procedure are operator-dependent, the pre-emption indicators shall be
treated as follows:

1\. The values of the last received *Pre-emption Vulnerability* IE and
*Priority Level* IE shall prevail.

2\. If the *Pre-emption Capability* IE is set to "may trigger
pre-emption", then this allocation request may trigger the pre-emption
procedure.

3\. If the *Pre-emption Capability* IE is set to "shall not trigger
pre-emption", then this allocation request shall not trigger the
pre-emption procedure.

4\. If the *Pre-emption Vulnerability* IE is set to "pre-emptable", then
this E-RAB shall be included in the pre-emption process.

5\. If the *Pre-emption Vulnerability* IE is set to "not pre-emptable",
then this E-RAB shall not be included in the pre-emption process.

6\. If the *Priority Level* IE is set to "no priority" the given values
for the *Pre-emption Capability* IE and *Pre-emption Vulnerability* IE
shall not be considered. Instead the values "shall not trigger
pre-emption" and "not pre-emptable" shall prevail.

\- The E-UTRAN pre-emption process shall keep the following rules:

1\. E-UTRAN shall only pre‑empt E-RABs with lower priority, in ascending
order of priority.

2\. The pre-emption may be done for E-RABs belonging to the same UE or
to other UEs.

The eNB shall report to the MME, in the E-RAB SETUP RESPONSE message,
the result for all the requested E-RABs.

\- A list of E-RABs which are successfully established shall be included
in the *E-RAB Setup List* IE.

\- A list of E-RABs which failed to be established, if any, shall be
included in the *E-RAB Failed to Setup List* IE.

In case of the establishment of an E-RAB the EPC must be prepared to
receive user data before the E-RAB SETUP RESPONSE message has been
received.

When the eNB reports unsuccessful establishment of an E-RAB, the cause
value should be precise enough to enable the MME to know the reason for
an unsuccessful establishment, e.g., "Radio resources not available",
"Failure in the Radio Interface Procedure".

**Interactions with Handover Preparation procedure:**

If a handover becomes necessary during E-RAB Setup, the eNB may
interrupt the ongoing E-RAB Setup procedure and initiate the Handover
Preparation procedure as follows:

1\. The eNB shall send the E-RAB SETUP RESPONSE message in which the eNB
shall indicate, if necessary

\- all the E-RABs fail with an appropriate cause value, e.g., "S1 intra
system Handover triggered", "S1 inter system Handover triggered" or "X2
Handover triggered".

2\. The eNB shall trigger the handover procedure.

#### 8.2.1.3 Unsuccessful Operation

The unsuccessful operation is specified in the successful operation
section.

#### 8.2.1.4 Abnormal Conditions

If the eNB receives a E-RAB SETUP REQUEST message containing a *E-RAB
Level QoS Parameters* IE which contains a *QCI* IE indicating a GBR
bearer (as defined in TS 23.203 \[13\]), and which does not contain the
*GBR QoS Information* IE, the eNB shall consider the establishment of
the corresponding E-RAB as failed.

If the eNB receives an E-RAB SETUP REQUEST message containing several
*E-RAB ID* IEs (in the *E-RAB To Be Setup List* IE) set to the same
value, the eNB shall report the establishment of the corresponding
E-RABs as failed in the E-RAB SETUP RESPONSE with the appropriate cause
value, e.g., "Multiple E-RAB ID instances".

If the eNB receives an E-RAB SETUP REQUEST message containing a *E-RAB
ID* IE (in the *E-RAB To Be Setup List* IE) set to the value that
identifies an active E-RAB (established before the E-RAB SETUP REQUEST
message was received), the eNB shall report the establishment of the new
E-RAB as failed in the E-RAB SETUP RESPONSE with the appropriate cause
value, e.g., "Multiple E-RAB ID instances".

If the eNB receives an E-RAB SETUP REQUEST message containing both the
*Correlation ID* and the *SIPTO Correlation ID* IEs for the same E-RAB,
the eNB shall consider the establishment of the corresponding E-RAB as
failed.

### 8.2.2 E-RAB Modify

#### 8.2.2.1 General

The purpose of the E-RAB Modify procedure is to enable modifications of
already established E-RABs for a given UE. The procedure uses
UE-associated signalling.

#### 8.2.2.2 Successful Operation

Figure 8.2.2.2-1: E-RAB Modify procedure. Successful operation.

The MME initiates the procedure by sending an E-RAB MODIFY REQUEST
message to the eNB.

\- The E-RAB MODIFY REQUEST message shall contain the information
required by the eNB to modify one or several E-RABs of the existing
E-RAB configuration.

Information shall be present in the E-RAB MODIFY REQUEST message only
when any previously set value for the E-RAB configuration is requested
to be modified.

Upon reception of the E-RAB MODIFY REQUEST message, and if resources are
available for the requested target configuration, the eNB shall execute
the modification of the requested E-RAB configuration. For each E-RAB
that shall be modified and for which the *Transport Information* IE is
not included and based on the new *E-RAB level QoS parameters* IE the
eNB shall modify the Data Radio Bearer configuration and change
allocation of resources on Uu according to the new resource request. The
eNB shall pass the *NAS-PDU* IE received for the E-RAB to the UE when
modifying the Data Radio Bearer configuration. The eNB does not send the
NAS PDUs associated to the failed Data radio bearers to the UE. The eNB
shall change allocation of resources on S1 according to the new resource
request.

If the E-UTRAN failed to modify an E-RAB the E-UTRAN shall keep the
E-RAB configuration as it was configured prior the E-RAB MODIFY REQUEST.

The E-RAB MODIFY REQUEST message may contain the

\- the *UE Aggregate Maximum Bit Rate* IE,

\- the *Secondary RAT Data Usage Request* IE.

If the *UE Aggregate Maximum Bit Rate* IE is included in the E-RAB
MODIFY REQUEST, the eNB shall

\- replace the previously provided UE Aggregate Maximum Bit Rate by the
received UE Aggregate Maximum Bit Rate in the UE context;

\- use the received UE Aggregate Maximum Bit Rate for non-GBR Bearers
for the concerned UE.

If the *UE* *Aggregate Maximum Bit Rate* IE is not contained in the
E-RAB MODIFY REQUEST message, the eNB shall use the previously provided
UE Aggregate Maximum Bit Rate which is stored in the UE context.

The modification of resources according to the values of the *Allocation
and Retention Priority* IE shall follow the principles described for the
E-RAB Setup procedure.

If the *Transport Information* IE is included in the E-RAB MODIFY
REQUEST message, the eNB shall use the included information as the new
S-GW address and uplink packet destination for the relevant E-RAB as
defined in TS 23.401 \[11\], and it shall ignore the *E-RAB Level QoS
Parameters* and *NAS-PDU* IEs for the same E-RAB.

The eNB shall report to the MME, in the E-RAB MODIFY RESPONSE message,
the result for all the requested E-RABs to be modified.

\- A list of E-RABs which are successfully modified shall be included in
the *E-RAB Modify List* IE.

\- A list of E-RABs which failed to be modified, if any, shall be
included in the *E-RAB Failed to Modify List* IE.

When the eNB reports unsuccessful modification of an E-RAB, the cause
value should be precise enough to enable the MME to know the reason for
an unsuccessful modification, e.g., "Radio resources not available",
"Failure in the Radio Interface Procedure".

In case of a modification of an E-RAB the EPC must be prepared to
receive user data according to the modified E-RAB profile prior to the
E-RAB MODIFY RESPONSE message.

If the *Secondary RAT Data Usage Request* IE set to \"requested\" was
included in the E-RAB MODIFY REQUEST message, and the eNB supports
EN-DC, LAA, LWA or LWIP and has secondary RAT usage data to report, then
the *Secondary RAT Usage Report List* IE shall be included in the E-RAB
MODIFY RESPONSE message.

**Interactions with Handover Preparation procedure:**

If a handover becomes necessary during E-RAB modify, the eNB may
interrupt the ongoing E-RAB Modify procedure and initiate the Handover
Preparation procedure as follows:

1\. The eNB shall send the E-RAB MODIFY RESPONSE message in which the
eNB shall indicate, if necessary

\- all the E-RABs fail with an appropriate cause value, e.g., "S1 intra
system Handover triggered", "S1 inter system Handover triggered" or "X2
Handover triggered".

2\. The eNB shall trigger the handover procedure.

#### 8.2.2.3 Unsuccessful Operation

The unsuccessful operation is specified in the successful operation
section.

#### 8.2.2.4 Abnormal Conditions

If the eNB receives a E-RAB MODIFY REQUEST message containing a *E-RAB
Level QoS Parameters* IE which contains a *QCI* IE indicating a GBR
bearer (as defined in TS 23.203 \[13\]) for a E-RAB previously
configured as a non-GBR bearer (as defined in TS 23.203 \[13\]), and
which does not contain the *GBR QoS Information* IE, the eNB shall
consider the modification of the corresponding E-RAB as failed.

If the eNB receives an E-RAB MODIFY REQUEST message containing several
*E-RAB ID* IEs (in the *E-RAB to be Modified List* IE) set to the same
value, the eNB shall report the modification of the corresponding E-RABs
as failed in the E-RAB MODIFY RESPONSE with the appropriate cause value,
e.g., "Multiple E-RAB ID instances".

If the eNB receives an E-RAB MODIFY REQUEST message containing some
*E-RAB ID* IEs that eNB does not recognize, the eNB shall report the
corresponding invalid E-RABs as failed in the E-RAB MODIFY RESPONSE with
the appropriate cause value, e.g., "Unknown E-RAB ID".

### 8.2.3 E-RAB Release

#### 8.2.3.1 General

The purpose of the E-RAB Release procedure is to enable the release of
already established E-RABs for a given UE. The procedure uses
UE-associated signalling.

#### 8.2.3.2 Successful Operation

##### 8.2.3.2.1 E-RAB Release -- MME initiated

Figure 8.2.3.2.1-1: E-RAB Release procedure. Successful operation.

The MME initiates the procedure by sending an E-RAB RELEASE COMMAND
message.

The E-RAB RELEASE COMMAND message shall contain the information required
by the eNB to release at least one E-RAB in the *E-RAB To Be Released
List* IE. If a *NAS-PDU* IE is contained in the message, the eNB shall
pass it to the UE.

Upon reception of the E-RAB RELEASE COMMAND message the eNB shall
execute the release of the requested E-RABs. For each E-RAB to be
released the eNB shall release the corresponding Data Radio Bearer and
release the allocated resources on Uu. The eNB shall pass the value
contained in the *E-RAB ID* IE received for the E-RAB to the radio
interface protocol for each Data Radio Bearer to be released. The eNB
shall release allocated resources on S1 for the E-RABs requested to be
released.

The E-RAB RELEASE COMMAND message may contain

\- the *UE Aggregate Maximum Bit Rate* IE.

If the *UE Aggregate Maximum Bit Rate* IE is included in the E-RAB
RELEASE COMMAND the eNB shall

\- replace the previously provided UE Aggregate Maximum Bit Rate by the
received UE Aggregate Maximum Bit Rate in the UE context; the eNB shall
use the received UE Aggregate Maximum Bit Rate for non-GBR Bearers for
the concerned UE.

If the *UE* *Aggregate Maximum Bit Rate* IE is not contained in the
E-RAB RELEASE COMMAND message, the eNB shall use the previously provided
UE Aggregate Maximum Bit Rate which is stored in the UE context.

The eNB shall report to the MME, in the E-RAB RELEASE RESPONSE message,
the result for all the E-RABs to be released.

\- A list of E-RABs which are released successfully shall be included in
the *E-RAB Release List* IE.

\- A list of E-RABs which failed to be released, if any, shall be
included in the *E-RAB Failed to Release List* IE.

The eNB shall be prepared to receive an E-RAB RELEASE COMMAND message on
an established UE-associated logical S1-connection containing an *E-RAB
Release List* IE at any time and shall always reply to it with an E-RAB
RELEASE RESPONSE message.

The eNB shall, if supported, report in the E-RAB RELEASE RESPONSE
message location information of the UE in the *User Location
Information* IE.

After sending an E-RAB RELEASE RESPONSE message containing an E-RAB ID
within the *E-RAB Release List* IE, the eNB shall be prepared to receive
an E-RAB SETUP REQUEST message requesting establishment of an E-RAB with
this E-RAB ID.

If the *User Location Information* IE is included in the E-RAB RELEASE
RESPONSE message, the MME shall handle this information as specified in
TS 23.401 \[11\].

If the *Secondary RAT Usage Report List* IE is included in the E-RAB
RELEASE RESPONSE message, the MME shall handle this information as
specified in TS 23.401 \[11\].

##### 8.2.3.2.2 E-RAB Release Indication -- eNB initiated

Figure 8.2.3.2.2-1: E-RAB Release INDICATION procedure. Successful
operation.

The eNB initiates the procedure by sending an E-RAB RELEASE INDICATION
message towards the MME.

The E-RAB RELEASE INDICATION message shall contain at least one E-RAB
released at the eNB, in the *E-RAB Released List* IE.

The eNB shall, if supported, report in the E-RAB RELEASE INDICATION
message location information of the UE in the *User Location
Information* IE.

Upon reception of the E-RAB RELEASE INDICATION message the MME shall
normally initiate the appropriate release procedure on the core network
side for the E-RABs identified in the E-RAB RELEASE INDICATION message.

If the *User Location Information* IE is included in the E-RAB RELEASE
INDICATION message, the MME shall handle this information as specified
in TS 23.401 \[11\].

If the *Secondary RAT Usage Report List* IE is included in the E-RAB
RELEASE INDICATION message, the MME shall handle this information as
specified in TS 23.401 \[11\].

**Interaction with UE Context Release Request procedure:**

If the eNB wants to remove all remaining E-RABs, e.g., for user
inactivity, the UE Context Release Request procedure shall be used
instead.

#### 8.2.3.3 Abnormal Conditions

If the eNB receives an E-RAB RELEASE COMMAND message containing multiple
*E-RAB ID* IEs (in the *E-RAB To Be Released List* IE) set to the same
value, the eNB shall initiate the release of one corresponding E-RAB and
ignore the duplication of the instances of the selected corresponding
E-RABs.

If the MME receives an E-RAB RELEASE INDICATION message containing
multiple *E-RAB ID* IEs (in the *E-RAB Released List* IE) set to the
same value, the MME shall initiate the release of one corresponding
E-RAB and ignore the duplication of the instances of the selected
corresponding E-RABs.

If the eNB receives an E-RAB RELEASE COMMAND message containing some
*E-RAB ID* IEs that eNB does not recognize, the eNB shall report the
corresponding invalid E-RABs as failed in the E-RAB RELEASE RESPONSE
message with the appropriate cause, e.g., "Unknown E-RAB ID".

### 8.2.4 E-RAB Modification Indication

#### 8.2.4.1 General

The purpose of the E-RAB Modification Indication procedure is to enable
the eNB to request modifications of already established E-RABs for a

#### 8.2.4.2 Successful Operation

Figure 8.2.4.2-1: E-RAB Modification Indication procedure. Successful
operation.

The eNB initiates the procedure by sending an E-RAB MODIFICATION
INDICATION message to the MME.

The *Transport Layer Address* IE and *DL GTP TEID* IE included in the
*E-RAB To Be Modified Item IEs* IE in the E-RAB MODIFICATION INDICATON
message shall be considered by the MME as the new DL address of the
E-RABs. The *Transport Layer Address* IE and *DL GTP TEID* IE included
in the *E-RAB Not To Be Modified Item IEs* IE in the E-RAB MODIFICATION
INDICATION message shall be considered by the MME as the E-RABs with
unchanged DL address

If the *Secondary RAT Usage Report List* IE is included in the E-RAB
MODIFICATION INDICATION message, the MME shall handle this information
as specified in TS 23.401 \[11\].

The E-RAB MODIFICATION CONFIRM message shall contain the result for all
the E-RABs that were requested to be modified according to the *E-RAB To
Be Modified Item IEs* IE of the E-RAB MODIFICATION INDICATION message as
follows:

\- A list of E-RABs which are successfully modified shall be included in
the *E-RAB Modify List* IE.

### 8.3.2 UE Context Release Request (eNB initiated)

#### 8.3.2.1 General

The purpose of the UE Context Release Request procedure is to enable the
eNB to request the MME to release the UE-associated logical
S1-connection due to E-UTRAN generated reasons, e.g., "TX2~RELOCOverall~
Expiry". The procedure uses UE-associated signalling.

#### 8.3.2.2 Successful Operation

Figure 8.3.2.2-1: UE Context Release Request procedure. Successful
operation.

The eNB controlling a UE-associated logical S1-connection initiates the
procedure by generating a UE CONTEXT RELEASE REQUEST message towards the
affected MME node.

The UE CONTEXT RELEASE REQUEST message shall indicate the appropriate
cause value, e.g., "User Inactivity", "Radio Connection With UE Lost",
"CSG Subscription Expiry", "CS Fallback triggered", "Redirection towards
1xRTT", "Inter-RAT Redirection", "UE Not Available for PS Service",
"Release due to pre-emption", for the requested UE-associated logical
S1-connection release.

If the *Secondary RAT Usage Report List* IE is included in the UE
CONTEXT RELEASE REQUEST message, the MME shall handle this information
as specified in TS 23.401 \[11\].

**Interactions with UE Context Release procedure:**

The UE Context Release procedure should be initiated upon reception of a
UE CONTEXT RELEASE REQUEST message. If the UE was configured with EN-DC
radio resources at the time UE Context Release Request procedure was
triggered, and the PSCell information was available, the eNB shall store
the PSCell information in the UE context.

### 8.3.3 UE Context Release (MME initiated)

#### 8.3.3.1 General

The purpose of the UE Context Release procedure is to enable the MME to
order the release of the UE-associated logical connection due to various
reasons, e.g., completion of a transaction between the UE and the EPC,
or completion of successful handover, or completion of handover
cancellation, or release of the old UE-associated logical S1-connection
when two UE-associated logical S1-connections toward the same UE is
detected after the UE has initiated the establishment of a new
UE-associated logical S1-connection, or the UE is no longer allowed to
access the CSG cell (i.e., the UE becomes a non-member of the currently
used CSG cell). The procedure uses UE-associated S1 connection.

#### 8.3.3.2 Successful Operation

Figure 8.3.3.2-1: UE Context Release procedure. Successful operation.

The MME initiates the procedure by sending the UE CONTEXT RELEASE
COMMAND message to the eNB.

The UE CONTEXT RELEASE COMMAND message shall contain the *UE S1AP ID
pair* IE if available, otherwise the message shall contain the ***MME UE
S1AP ID* IE**.

The MME provides the *cause* IE set to "Load Balancing TAU Required" in
the UE CONTEXT RELEASE COMMAND message sent to the eNB for all load
balancing and offload cases in the MME.

Upon reception of the UE CONTEXT RELEASE COMMAND message, the eNB shall
release all related signalling and user data transport resources and
reply with the UE CONTEXT RELEASE COMPLETE message. In case of eNB
supporting L-GW function for LIPA and/or SIPTO\@LN operation, the eNB
shall also release any related tunnel resources. In case of successful
handover, the eNB using L-GW function for SIPTO\@LN operation shall also
request using intra-node signalling the collocated L-GW to release the
SIPTO\@LN PDN connection as defined in TS 23.401 \[11\].

The eNB shall, if supported, report in the UE CONTEXT RELEASE COMPLETE
message location information of the UE in the *User Location
Information* IE. If the *PSCell Information* IE is included in the *User
Location Information* IE, it indicates the UE was configured with EN-DC
radio resources at the eNB . Also, if the *Time Since Secondary Node
Release* IE is included in the UE CONTEXT RELEASE COMPLETE message, it
indicates the time elapsed since EN-DC operation in the eNB was stopped
for the UE.

If the *User Location Information* IE is included in the UE CONTEXT
RELEASE COMPLETE message, the MME shall handle this information as
specified in TS 23.401 \[11\].

If the *Information on Recommended Cells and eNBs for Paging* IE is
included in the UE CONTEXT RELEASE COMPLETE message, the MME shall, if
supported, store it and may use it for subsequent paging.

If the *Cell Identifier and Coverage Enhancement Level* IE is included
in the UE CONTEXT RELEASE COMPLETE message, the MME shall, if supported,
store it and use it for subsequent paging.

If the *Secondary RAT Usage Report List* IE is included in the UE
CONTEXT RELEASE COMPLETE message, the MME shall handle this information
as specified in TS 23.401 \[11\].

#### 8.3.3.3 Abnormal Conditions

If the UE Context Release procedure is not initiated towards the eNB
before the expiry of the timer TS1~RELOCOverall~, the eNB shall request
the MME to release the UE context.

If the UE returns to the eNB before the reception of the UE CONTEXT
RELEASE COMMAND message or the expiry of the timer TS1~RELOCOverall~,
the eNB shall stop the TS1~RELOCOverall~ and continue to serve the UE.

8.4 Handover Signalling
-----------------------

### 8.4.1 Handover Preparation

#### 8.4.1.1 General

The purpose of the Handover Preparation procedure is to request the
preparation of resources at the target side via the EPC. There is only
one Handover Preparation procedure ongoing at the same time for a
certain UE.

#### 8.4.1.2 Successful Operation

Figure 8.4.1.2-1: Handover preparation: successful operation

The source eNB initiates the handover preparation by sending the
HANDOVER REQUIRED message to the serving MME. When the source eNB sends
the HANDOVER REQUIRED message, it shall start the timer TS1~RELOCprep.~
The source eNB shall indicate the appropriate cause value for the
handover in the *Cause* IE.

The source eNB shall include the *Source to Target Transparent
Container* IE in the HANDOVER REQUIRED message.

In case of intra-system handover, the information in the *Source to
Target Transparent Container* IE shall be encoded according to the
definition of the *Source eNB to Target eNB Transparent Container* IE.
In case of handover to UTRAN, the information in the *Source to Target
Transparent Container* IE shall be encoded according to the *Source RNC
to Target RNC Transparent Container* IE definition as specified in TS
25.413 \[19\] and the source eNB shall include the *UE History
Information* IE in the *Source RNC to Target RNC Transparent Container*
IE. If the handover is to GERAN A/Gb mode then the information in the
*Source to Target Transparent Container* IE shall be encoded according
to the definition of the *Source BSS to Target BSS Transparent
Container* IE as described in TS 48.018 \[18\]. If the handover is to
NG-RAN, the information in the *Source to Target Transparent Container*
IE shall be encoded according to the *Source NG-RAN Node to Target
NG-RAN Node Transparent Container*IE definition as specified in TS
38.413 \[44\].

When the preparation, including the reservation of resources at the
target side is ready, the MME responds with the HANDOVER COMMAND message
to the source eNB.

If the *Target to Source Transparent Container* IE has been received by
the MME from the handover target then the transparent container shall be
included in the HANDOVER COMMAND message.

Upon reception of the HANDOVER COMMAND message the source eNB shall stop
the timer TS1~RELOCprep~ and start the timer TS1~RELOCOverall~.

In case of intra-system handover, the information in the *Target to
Source Transparent Container* IE shall be encoded according to the
definition of the *Target eNB to Source eNB Transparent Container* IE.
In case of inter-system handover to UTRAN, the information in the
*Target to Source Transparent Container* IE shall be encoded according
to the *Target RNC to Source RNC Transparent Container* IE definition as
specified in TS 25.413 \[19\]. In case of inter-system handover to GERAN
A/Gb mode, the information in the *Target to Source Transparent
Container* IE shall be encoded according to the *Target BSS to Source
BSS Transparent Container* IE definition as described in TS 48.018
\[18\]. In case of inter-system handover to NG-RAN, the information in
the *Target to Source Transparent Container* IE shall be encoded
according to the *Target NG-RAN Node to Source NG-RAN Node Transparent
Container* IE definition as specified in TS 38.413 \[44\].

If the *Direct Forwarding Path Availability* IE is included in the
*Target NG-RAN Node to Source NG-RAN Node Transparent Container* IE
within the HANDOVER COMMAND message, the source eNB shall, if supported,
use it for direct data forwarding between the source SN and the target
NG-RAN node.

If there are any E-RABs that could not be admitted in the target, they
shall be indicated in the *E-RABs to Release List* IE.

If the *DL forwarding* IE is included within the *Source eNB to Target
eNB Transparent Container* IE of the HANDOVER REQUIRED message and it is
set to "DL forwarding proposed", it indicates that the source eNB
proposes forwarding of downlink data.

If the MME receives the *Direct Forwarding Path Availability* IE in the
HANDOVER REQUIRED message indicating that a direct data path is
available, it shall handle it as specified in TS 23.401 \[11\].

If the *CSG Id* IE and no *Cell Access Mode* IE are received in the
HANDOVER REQUIRED message, the MME shall perform the access control
according to the CSG Subscription Data of that UE and, if the access
control is successful or if at least one of the E-RABs has a particular
ARP value (see TS 23.401 \[11\]), it shall continue the handover and
propagate the *CSG Id* IE to the target side. If the access control is
unsuccessful but at least one of the E-RABs has a particular ARP value
(see TS 23.401 \[11\]) the MME shall also provide the *CSG Membership
Status* IE set to "non member" to the target side.

If the *CSG Id* IE and the *Cell Access Mode* IE set to "hybrid" are
received in the HANDOVER REQUIRED message, the MME shall provide the
membership status of the UE and the CSG Id to the target side.

The source eNB shall include the *SRVCC HO Indication* IE in the
HANDOVER REQUIRED message if the SRVCC operation is needed as defined in
TS 23.216 \[9\]. The source eNB shall indicate to the MME in the *SRVCC
HO Indication* IE if the handover shall be prepared for PS and CS domain
or only for CS domain. The *SRVCC HO Indication* IE is set according to
the target cell capability and UE capability. In case the target system
is GERAN without DTM support or the UE is without DTM support, the
source eNB shall indicate "CS only" in the *SRVCC HO Indication* IE and
"PS service not available" in *PS Service Not Available* IE. In case the
target system is either GERAN with DTM but without DTM HO support and
the UE is supporting DTM or the target system is UTRAN without PS HO
support, the source eNB shall indicate "CS only" in the *SRVCC HO
Indication* IE. Otherwise, the source eNB shall indicate "PS and CS" in
the *SRVCC HO Indication* IE.

In case of inter-system handover from E-UTRAN, the source eNB shall
indicate in the *Target ID* IE, in case the target system is UTRAN, the
Target RNC-ID of the RNC (including the Routing Area Code only in case
the UTRAN PS domain is involved), in case the target system is GERAN the
Cell Global Identity (including the Routing Area Code only in case the
GERAN PS domain is involved) of the cell, and in case the target system
is NG-RAN the **Target NG-RAN Node ID** of the NG-RAN node in the target
system.

In case of inter-system handover from E-UTRAN to UTRAN, the source eNB
shall, if supported, include the *HO Cause Value* IE in the *UE History
Information* IE of the HANDOVER REQUIRED message.

In case the SRVCC operation is performed and the *SRVCC HO Indication*
IE indicates that handover shall be prepared only for CS domain, and if

\- the target system is GERAN, then the source eNB

Secondary* IE in the HANDOVER COMMAND message.

In case the SRVCC operation is performed, the *SRVCC HO Indication* IE
in the HANDOVER REQUIRED message indicates that handover shall be
prepared for PS and CS domain,

\- the target system is GERAN with DTM HO support, and if

\- the Handover Preparation procedure has succeeded in the CS and PS
domain, then the MME

\- shall encode the information in the *Target to Source Transparent
Container* IE within the HANDOVER COMMAND message according to the
definition of the *Layer 3 Information* IE as specified in TS 48.008
\[23\], and

\- shall include the *Target to Source Transparent Container*
*Secondary* IE in the HANDOVER COMMAND message and encode information in
it according to the definition of the *Target BSS to Source BSS
Transparent Container* IE as specified in TS 48.018 \[18\];

\- the Handover Preparation procedure has succeeded in the CS domain
only, then the MME

\- shall encode the information in the *Target to Source Transparent

Secondary* IE in the HANDOVER COMMAND message.

If the HANDOVER COMMAND message contains the *DL GTP-TEID* IE and the
*DL Transport Layer Address* IE for a given bearer in the ***E-RABs
Subject to Forwarding List*** *IE,* then the source eNB shall consider
that the forwarding of downlink data for this given bearer is possible.

If the HANDOVER COMMAND message contains the *UL GTP-TEID* IE and the
*UL Transport Layer Address* IE for a given bearer in the ***E-RABs
Subject to Forwarding List*** *IE,* then it means the target eNB has
requested the forwarding of uplink data for this given bearer.

If the *DAPS Request Information* IE is included for an E-RAB in the
*Source eNB to Target eNB Transparent Container* IE within the HANDOVER
REQUIRED message, it indicates that the request concerns a DAPS Handover
for that E-RAB, as described in TS 36.300 \[14\].

If the *Direct Forwarding Path Availability* IE is included in the
*Target eNB to Source eNB Transparent Container* IE, the source eNB
shall, if supported, use it for direct data forwarding between the
source SN and the target eNB as specified in TS 37.340 \[32\].

**Interactions with E-RAB Management procedures:**

If, after a HANDOVER REQUIRED message is sent and before the Handover
Preparation procedure is terminated, the source eNB receives an MME
initiated E-RAB Management procedure on the same UE associated
signalling connection, the source eNB shall either:

1\. cancel the Handover Preparation procedure by executing the Handover
Cancel procedure with an appropriate cause value. After successful
completion of the Handover Cancel procedure, the source eNB shall
continue the MME initiated E-RAB Management procedure

or

2\. terminate the MME initiated E-RAB Management procedure by sending
the appropriate response message with an appropriate cause value, e.g.,
"S1 intra system Handover Triggered", "S1 inter system Handover
Triggered" to the MME and then the source eNB shall continue with the
handover procedure.

#### 8.4.1.3 Unsuccessful Operation

Figure 8.4.1.3-1: Handover preparation: unsuccessful operation

If the EPC or the target system is not able to accept any of the bearers
or a failure occurs during the Handover Preparation, the MME sends the
HANDOVER PREPARATION FAILURE message with an appropriate cause value to
the source eNB.

If the *CSG Id* IE and no *Cell Access Mode* IE are received in the
HANDOVER REQUIRED message and the access control is unsuccessful and
none of the E-RABs has a particular ARP value (see TS 23.401 \[11\]) the
MME shall send the HANDOVER PREPARATION FAILURE message with an
appropriate cause value to the source eNB, except when one of the E-RABs
has a particular ARP value (see TS 23.401 \[11\]). Upon reception, the
source eNB may decide to prevent handover for that UE towards CSG
(Closed Access Mode) cells with corresponding CSG Id.

**Interaction with Handover Cancel procedure:**

If there is no response from the EPC to the HANDOVER REQUIRED message
before timer TS1~RELOCprep~ expires in the source eNB, the source eNB
should cancel the Handover Preparation procedure by initiating the
Handover Cancel procedure with the appropriate value for the *Cause* IE.
The source eNB shall ignore any HANDOVER COMMAND message or HANDOVER
PREPARATION FAILURE message received after the initiation of the
Handover Cancel procedure.

#### 8.4.1.4 Abnormal Conditions

If the eNB receives at least one E-RAB ID included in the ***E-RABs
Subject to Forwarding List*** *IE without at least one valid associated
tunnel address pair (in either UL or DL), then the eNB shall consider it
as a logical error and act as described in subclause 10.4. A GTP tunnel
address pair is considered valid if both the GTP-TEID IE and the
Transport Layer Address IE are present.*

### 8.4.2 Handover Resource Allocation

#### 8.4.2.1 General

The purpose of the Handover Resource Allocation procedure is to reserve
resources at the target eNB for the handover of a UE.

#### 8.4.2.2 Successful Operation

Figure 8.4.2.2-1: Handover resource allocation: successful operation

The MME initiates the procedure by sending the HANDOVER REQUEST message
to the target eNB. The HANDOVER REQUEST message may contain the
*Handover Restriction List* IE, which contains roaming or access
restrictions.

If the *Handover Restriction List* IE is contained in the HANDOVER
REQUEST message, the target eNB shall store this information in the UE
context. This information shall however not be considered whenever one
of the handed over E-RABs has a particular ARP value (TS 23.401 \[11\]).

The target eNB shall use the information in *Handover Restriction List*
IE if present in the HANDOVER REQUEST message to

\- determine a target for subsequent mobility action for which the eNB
provides information about the target of the mobility action towards the
UE;

\- select a proper SCG during dual connectivity operation.

If the *Handover Restriction List* IE is not contained in the HANDOVER
REQUEST message, the target eNB shall consider that no roaming and no
access restriction apply to the UE.

Upon reception of the HANDOVER REQUEST message the eNB shall store the
received *UE Security Capabilities* IE in the UE context and use it to
prepare the configuration of the AS security relation with the UE.

If the *SRVCC Operation Possible* IE is included in the HANDOVER REQUEST
message, the target eNB shall store the content of the received *SRVCC
Operation Possible* IE in the UE context and, if supported, use it as
defined in TS 23.216 \[9\].

Upon reception of the HANDOVER REQUEST message the eNB shall store the
received *Security Context* IE in the UE context and the eNB shall use
it to derive the security configuration as specified in TS 33.401
\[15\].

If the *Trace Activation* IE is included in the HANDOVER REQUEST
message, the target eNB shall if supported, initiate the requested trace
function as described in TS 32.422 \[10\]. In particular, the eNB shall,
if supported:

\- if the *Trace Activation* IE does not include the *MDT Configuration*
IE, initiate the requested trace session as described in TS 32.422
\[10\];

\- if the *Trace Activation* IE includes the *MDT Activation* IE, within
the *MDT Configuration* IE, set to "Immediate MDT and Trace", initiate
the requested trace session and MDT session as described in TS 32.422
\[10\];

\- if the *Trace Activation* IE includes the *MDT Activation* IE, within
the *MDT Configuration* IE, set to "Immediate MDT Only", "Logged MDT
only" or "Logged MBSFN MDT", initiate the requested MDT session as
described in TS 32.422 \[10\] and the target eNB shall ignore
*Interfaces To Trace* IE, and *Trace Depth* IE.

\- if the *Trace Activation* IE includes the *MDT Location Information*
IE, within the *MDT Configuration* IE, store this information and take
it into account in the requested MDT session.

\- if the *Trace Activation* IE includes the *Signalling based MDT PLMN
List* IE, within the *MDT Configuration* IE, the eNB may use it to
propagate the MDT Configuration as described in TS 37.320 \[31\].

\- if the *Trace Activation* IE includes the *MBSFN-ResultToLog* IE,
within the *MDT Configuration* IE, take it into account for MDT
Configuration as described in TS 37.320 \[31\].

\- if the *Trace Activation* IE includes the *MBSFN-AreaId* IE in the
*MBSFN-ResultToLog* IE, within the *MDT Configuration* IE, take it into
account for MDT Configuration as described in TS 37.320 \[31\].

\- if the *Trace Activation* IE includes the *UE Application layer
measurement configuration* IE, initiate the requested trace session and
QoE Measurement Collection function as described in TS 36.300 \[14\].

\- if the *Trace Activation* IE includes the *Bluetooth Measurement
Configuration* IE, within the *MDT Configuration* IE, take it into
account for MDT Configuration as described in TS 37.320 \[31\].

\- if the *Trace Activation* IE includes the *WLAN Measurement
Configuration* IE, within the *MDT Configuration* IE, take it into
account for MDT Configuration as described in TS 37.320 \[31\].

\- if the *Trace Activation* IE includes the *MDT Configuration NR* IE,
store and forward the *MDT Configuration NR* IE to the SgNB, if the eNB
has configured EN-DC for the UE.

If the *CSG Id* IE is received in the HANDOVER REQUEST message, the eNB
shall compare the received value with the CSG Id broadcast by the target
cell.

If the *CSG Membership Status* IE is received in the HANDOVER REQUEST
message and the *CSG Membership Status* is set to "member", the eNB may
provide the QoS to the UE as for member provided that the CSG Id
received in the HANDOVER REQUEST messages corresponds to the CSG Id
broadcast by the target cell.

If the *CSG Membership Status* IE and the *CSG Id* IE are received in
the HANDOVER REQUEST message and the CSG Id does not correspond to the
CSG Id broadcast by the target cell, the eNB may provide the QoS to the
UE as for a non member and shall send back in the HANDOVER REQUEST
ACKNOWLEDGE message the actual CSG Id broadcast by the target cell.

If the target cell is CSG cell or hybrid cell, the target eNB shall
include the *CSG ID* IE in the HANDOVER REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE message.

If the target eNB receives the *CSG Id* IE and the *CSG Membership
Status* IE is set to "non member" in the HANDOVER REQUEST message and
the target cell is a closed cell and at least one of the E-RABs has a
particular ARP value (see TS 23.401 \[11\]), the eNB shall send back the
HANDOVER REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE message to the MME accepting those E-RABs
and failing the other E-RABs.

If the *Subscriber Profile ID* *for RAT/Frequency priority* IE is
contained in the *Source eNB to Target eNB Transparent Container* IE,
the target eNB shall store the content of the received *Subscriber
Profile ID for RAT/Frequency priority* IE in the UE context and use it
as defined in TS 36.300 \[14\].

If the *Additional RRM Policy Index* IE is contained in the *Source eNB
to Target eNB Transparent Container* IE, the target eNB shall, if
supported, store it and use it as defined in TS 36.300 \[14\].

Upon reception of the *UE History Information* IE, which is included
within the *Source eNB to Target eNB Transparent Container* IE in the
HANDOVER REQUEST message, the target eNB shall collect the information
defined as mandatory in the *UE History Information* IE and shall, if
supported, collect the information defined as optional in the *UE
History Information* IE, for as long as the UE stays in one of its
cells, and store the collected information to be used for future
handover preparations.

Upon reception of the *UE History Information from the UE* IE, which is
included within the *Source eNB to Target eNB Transparent Container* IE
in the HANDOVER REQUEST message, the target eNB shall, if supported,
store the collected information, to be used for future handover
preparations.

If the *Mobility Information* IE is included within the *Source eNB to
Target eNB Transparent Container* IE in the HANDOVER REQUEST message,
the target eNB shall, if supported, store this information and use it as
defined in TS 36.300 \[14\].

If the *Emergency Indicator* IE is included within the *Source eNB to
Target eNB Transparent Container* IE in the HANDOVER REQUEST message,
the target eNB shall, if supported, use it to allocate radio bearer
resources as specified in TS 23.502 \[51\].

If the *Expected UE Behaviour* IE is included in the HANDOVER REQUEST
message, the eNB shall, if supported, store this information and may use
it to determine the RRC connection time.

If the *Bearer Type* IE is included in the HANDOVER REQUEST message and
is set to \"non IP\", then the eNB shall not perform IP header
compression for the concerned E-RAB.

If the *Ethernet Type* IE is included in the HANDOVER REQUEST message
and is set to \"True\", then the eNB shall, if supported, take this into
account to perform header compression appropriately for the concerned
E-RAB.

In case of inter-system handover from gNB with direct forwarding, if the
target eNB receives the *UE Context Reference at Source* IE in the
*Source eNB to Target eNB Transparent Container* IE, it may use it for
internal forwarding as specified in TS 37.340 \[47\].

After all necessary resources for the admitted E-RABs have been
allocated, the target eNB shall generate the HANDOVER REQUEST
ACKNOWLEDGE message. The target eNB shall include in the *E-RABs
Admitted List* IE the E-RABs for which resources have been prepared at
the target cell. The E-RABs that have not been admitted in the target
cell, if any, shall be included in the *E-RABs Failed to Setup List* IE.

If the HANDOVER REQUEST message contains the *Data Forwarding Not
Possible* IE associated with a given E-RAB within the *E-RABs To Be
Setup List* IE set to "Data forwarding not possible", then the target
eNB may decide not to include the *DL Transport Layer Address* IE and
the *DL GTP-TEID* IE and for intra LTE handover the *UL Transport Layer
Address* IE and the *UL GTP-TEID* IE within the *E-RABs Admitted List*
IE of the HANDOVER REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE message for that E-RAB.

For each bearer that target eNB has decided to admit and for which *DL
forwarding* IE is set to "DL forwarding proposed", the target eNB may
include the *DL GTP-TEID IE* and the *DL Transport Layer Address* IE
within the *E-RABs Admitted List* IE of the HANDOVER REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE
message indicating that it accepts the proposed forwarding of downlink
data for this bearer.

If the HANDOVER REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE message contains the *UL GTP-TEID*
IE and the *UL Transport Layer Address* IE for a given bearer in the
*E-RABs Admitted List IE,* then it means the target eNB has requested
the forwarding of uplink data for this given bearer.

If the *Request Type* IE is included in the HANDOVER REQUEST message,
then the target eNB should perform the requested location reporting
functionality for the UE as described in subclause 8.11.

message only contains the EIA0 algorithm as defined in TS 33.401 \[15\]
and if this EIA0 algorithm is defined in the configured list of allowed
integrity protection algorithms in the eNB (TS 33.401 \[15\]), the eNB
shall take it into use and ignore the keys received in the *Security
Context* IE.

The *GUMMEI* IE shall only be contained in the HANDOVER REQUEST message
according to subclauses 4.6.2 and 4.7.6.6 of TS 36.300 \[14\]. If the

store the received information in the UE context, and use this
information to allow subsequent selections of the UE for management
based MDT defined in TS 32.422 \[10\].

If the *Masked IMEISV* IE is contained in the HANDOVER REQUEST message
the target eNB shall, if supported, use it to determine the
characteristics of the UE for subsequent handling.

If the HANDOVER REQUEST contains a *Target Cell ID* IE, as part of the
*Source eNB to Target eNB Transparent Container* IE, for a cell which is
no longer active, the eNB may respond with an HANDOVER REQUEST
ACKNOWLEDGE in case the PCI of the deactivated cell is in use by another
active cell.

If the *ProSe Authorized* IE is contained in the HANDOVER REQUEST
message and it contains one or more IEs set to "authorized", the eNB
shall, if supported, consider that the UE is authorized for the relevant
ProSe service(s).

If the *UE User Plane CIoT Support Indicator* IE is included in the
HANDOVER REQUEST message and is set to \"supported\", the eNB shall, if
supported, consider that User Plane CIoT EPS Optimisation as specified
in TS 23.401 \[11\] is supported for the UE.

If the *CE-mode-B Support Indicator* IE is included in the HANDOVER
REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE message and set to \"supported\", the MME shall, if

### 8.4.4 Path Switch Request

#### 8.4.4.1 General

The purpose of the Path Switch Request procedure is to establish a UE
associated signalling connection to the EPC and, if applicable, to
request the switch of a downlink GTP tunnel towards a new GTP tunnel
endpoint.

#### 8.4.4.2 Successful Operation

Figure 8.4.4.2-1: Path switch request: successful operation

The eNB initiates the procedure by sending the PATH SWITCH REQUEST
message to the MME.

If the ‎*E-RAB To Be Switched in Downlink List* IE in the PATH SWITCH
REQUEST message does not include all E-RABs previously included in the
UE Context, the MME shall consider the non included E-RABs as implicitly
released by the eNB.

When the eNB has received from the radio interface the *RRC Resume
Cause* IE, it shall include it in the PATH SWITCH REQUEST message.

After all necessary updates including the UP path switch have been
successfully completed in the EPC for at least one of the E-RABs
included in the PATH SWITCH REQUEST *E-RAB To Be Switched in Downlink
List* IE, the MME shall send the PATH SWITCH REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE message
to the eNB and the procedure ends. The UE-associated logical
S1-connection shall be established at reception of the PATH SWITCH
REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE message.

In case the EPC failed to perform the UP path switch for at least one,
but not all, of the E-RABs included in the PATH SWITCH REQUEST *E-RAB To
Be Switched in Downlink List* IE, the MME shall include the E-RABs it
failed to perform UP path switch in the PATH SWITCH REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE
*E-RAB To Be Released List* IE. In this case, the eNB shall release the
corresponding data radio bearers, and the eNB shall regard the E-RABs
indicated in the *E-RAB To Be Released List* IE as being fully released.

If the *CSG Id* IE and no *Cell Access Mode* IE are received in the PATH
SWITCH REQUEST message, the MME shall use it in the core network as
specified in TS 23.401 \[11\]. If the *CSG Id* IE and the *Cell Access
Mode* IE set to "hybrid" are received in the PATH SWITCH REQUEST
message, the MME shall decide the membership status of the UE and use it
in the core network as specified in TS 23.401 \[11\]. If no *CSG Id* IE
and no *Cell Access Mode* IE are received in the PATH SWITCH REQUEST
message and the UE was previously either in a CSG cell or in a hybrid
cell, the MME shall consider that the UE has moved into a cell that is
neither a CSG cell nor a hybrid cell and use this as specified in TS
23.401 \[11\].

If the GUMMEI of the MME currently serving the UE is available at the
eNB (see TS 36.300 \[14\]) the eNB shall include the *Source MME GUMMEI*
IE within the PATH SWITCH REQUEST message.

Upon reception of the PATH SWITCH REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE message the eNB
shall store the received *Security Context* IE in the UE context and the
eNB shall use it for the next X2 handover or Intra eNB handovers as
specified in TS 33.401 \[15\].

The PATH SWITCH REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE message may contain

\- the *UE Aggregate Maximum Bit Rate* IE.

\- the *MME UE S1AP ID 2* IE, which indicates the MME UE S1AP ID
assigned by the MME.

If the *UE Aggregate Maximum Bit Rate* IE is included in the PATH SWITCH
REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE message the eNB shall

\- replace the previously provided UE Aggregate Maximum Bit Rate by the
received UE Aggregate Maximum Bit Rate in the UE context; the eNB shall
use the received UE Aggregate Maximum Bit Rate for non-GBR Bearers for
the concerned UE.

If the *UE* *Aggregate Maximum Bit Rate* IE is not contained in the PATH
SWITCH REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE message, the eNB shall use the previously
provided UE Aggregate Maximum Bit Rate which is stored in the UE
context.

In case the EPC decides to change the uplink termination point of the
tunnels, it may include the *E-RAB To Be Switched in Uplink List* IE in
the PATH SWITCH REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE message to specify a new uplink
transport layer address and uplink GTP-TEID for each respective E-RAB
for which it wants to change the uplink tunnel termination point.

When the eNB receives the PATH SWITCH REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE message and if
this message includes the *E-RAB To Be Switched in Uplink List* IE, the
eNB shall start delivering the uplink packets of the concerned E-RABs to
the new uplink tunnel endpoints as indicated in the message.

When the eNB receives the PATH SWITCH REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE message
including the *CSG Membership Status* IE, and if the cell that serves
the UE is a hybrid cell, the eNB shall use it as defined in TS 36.300

If the *Subscription Based UE Differentiation Information* IE is
included in the PATH SWITCH REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE message, the eNB shall,
if supported, store this information in the UE context for further use
according to TS 23.401 \[11\].

If the *Handover Restriction List* IE is contained in the PATH SWITCH
REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE message, the eNB shall, if supported, overwrite any
previously stored handover restriction information in the UE context and
use the information in the *Handover Restriction List* IE to:

\- determine a target for subsequent mobility action for which the eNB
provides information about the target of the mobility action towards the
UE;

\- select a proper SCG during dual connectivity operation;

The PATH SWITCH REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE message may contain the *Additional
RRM Policy Index* IE, if available in the MME for cases specified in TS
23.401 \[11\]. The eNB shall, if supported, store it and use it as
specified in TS 36.300 \[14\].

If the *UE Radio Capability ID* IE is included in the PATH SWITCH
REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE message, the eNB shall, if supported, use it as
defined in TS 23.401 \[11\].

If the UE is configured with EN-DC radio resources and the PSCell
information is available, the *PSCell Information* IE shall be included
in the PATH SWITCH REQUEST message.

If the *NR V2X Services Authorized* IE is contained in the PATH SWITCH
REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE message, the eNB shall, if supported, update its V2X
services authorization information for the UE accordingly. If the *NR
V2X Services Authorized* IE includes one or more IEs set to \"not
authorized\", the eNB shall, if supported, initiate actions to ensure
that the UE is no longer accessing the relevant service(s).

If the EPC fails to switch the downlink GTP tunnel endpoint towards a
new GTP tunnel endpoint for all E-RABs included in the *E-RAB To Be
Switched in Downlink List* IE during the execution of the Path Switch
Request procedure, the MME shall send the PATH SWITCH REQUEST FAILURE
message to the eNB with an appropriate cause value. In this case, the
eNB should decide its subsequent actions and the MME should behave as
described in TS 23.401 \[11\].

#### 8.4.4.4 Abnormal Conditions

If the MME receives a PATH SWITCH REQUEST message containing several
*E-RAB ID* IEs (in the *E-RAB To Be Switched in Downlink List* IE) set
to the same value, the MME shall send the PATH SWITCH REQUEST FAILURE
message to the eNB.

If the MME receives a PATH SWITCH REQUEST message without the *CSG
Membership Status* IE, and the cell accessed by the UE is a hybrid cell
with a different CSG from the source cell or the source cell does not
have a CSG ID, the MME shall send the PATH SWITCH REQUEST FAILURE
message to the eNB.

If the *CSG Membership Status* IE is not included in the PATH SWITCH
REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE message and the cell accessed by the UE is a hybrid
cell with a different CSG from the source cell or the source cell does
not have a CSG ID, the eNB shall consider the procedure as
unsuccessfully terminated and initiate local error handling.

### 8.4.5 Handover Cancellation

#### 8.4.5.1 General

The purpose of the Handover Cancel procedure is to enable a source eNB
to cancel an ongoing handover preparation or an already prepared
handover.

The procedure uses UE-associated signalling.

#### 8.4.5.2 Successful Operation

Figure 8.4.5.2-1: Handover Cancel procedure. Successful operation.

The source eNB initiates the procedure by sending a HANDOVER CANCEL
message to the EPC.

The HANDOVER CANCEL message shall indicate the reason for cancelling the
handover with the appropriate value of the *Cause* IE.

Upon reception of a HANDOVER CANCEL message, the EPC shall terminate the
ongoing Handover Preparation procedure, release any resources associated
with the handover preparation and send a HANDOVER CANCEL ACKNOWLEDGE
message to the source eNB.

Transmission and reception of a HANDOVER CANCEL ACKNOWLEDGE message
terminate the procedure in the EPC and in the source eNB. After this,
the source eNB does not have a prepared handover for that UE-associated
logical S1-connection.

#### 8.4.5.3 Unsuccessful Operation

Not applicable.

#### 8.4.5.4 Abnormal Conditions

If the source eNB becomes aware of the fact that an expected HANDOVER
CANCEL ACKNOWLEDGE message is missing, the source eNB shall consider the
Handover Cancellation as successfully terminated.

### 8.4.6 eNB Status Transfer

The purpose of the eNB Status Transfer procedure is to transfer the
uplink PDCP-SN and HFN receiver status and the downlink PDCP-SN and HFN
transmitter status from the source to the target eNB via the MME during
an intra LTE S1 handover for each respective E-RAB for which PDCP-SN and
HFN status preservation applies.

#### 8.4.6.2 Successful Operation

Figure 8.4.6.2-1: eNB Status Transfer procedure

The source eNB initiates the procedure by stopping assigning PDCP-SNs to
downlink SDUs and sending the eNB STATUS TRANSFER message to the MME at
the point in time when it considers the transmitter/receiver status to
be frozen.

\- For each E-RAB for which PDCP-SN and HFN status preservation applies
the source eNB shall include the *E-RAB ID* IE, the *UL COUNT value* IE
and the *DL COUNT value* IE within the *E-RABs Subject to Status
Transfer Item* IE in the *eNB Status Transfer Transparent Container* IE
of the eNB STATUS TRANSFER message.

\- In case of 15 bit long PDCP-SN, for each E-RAB for which PDCP-SN and
HFN status preservation applies, the source eNB shall additionally
include the *UL COUNT Value Extended* IE and the *DL COUNT Value
Extended* IE within the *E-RABs Subject to Status Transfer Item* IE.

\- In case of 18 bit long PDCP-SN, for each E-RAB for which PDCP-SN and
HFN status preservation applies, the source eNB shall additionally
include the *UL COUNT Value for PDCP SN Length 18* IE and the *DL COUNT
Value for PDCP SN Length 18* IE within the *E-RABs Subject to Status
Transfer Item* IE.

The source eNB may also include in the eNB STATUS TRANSFER message the
missing and the received uplink SDUs in the *Receive Status Of UL PDCP
SDUs* **IE, or in the *Receive Status Of UL PDCP SDUs Extended* IE in

The purpose of the MME Status Transfer procedure is to transfer the
uplink PDCP-SN and HFN receiver status and the downlink PDCP-SN and HFN
transmitter status from the source to the target eNB via the MME during
an S1 handover for each respective E-RAB for which PDCP-SN and HFN
status preservation applies.

#### 8.4.7.2 Successful Operation

Figure 8.4.7.2-1: MME Status Transfer procedure

The MME initiates the procedure by sending the MME STATUS TRANSFER
message to the eNB. The target eNB using Full Configuration for this
handover as per TS 36.300 \[14\] shall ignore the information received
in this message.

For each bearer within the *E-RABs Subject to Status Transfer List* IE
within the *eNB Status Transfer Transparent Container* IE for which the
*UL COUNT value* IE is received in the MME STATUS TRANSFER message, the
target eNB shall apply the contained information and shall not deliver
any uplink packet which has a PDCP-SN lower than the value contained in
the *PDCP-SN* IE of this IE. If the *UL COUNT Value Extended* IE or *UL
COUNT Value for PDCP SN Length 18* IE is included in the *E-RABs Subject
to Status Transfer Item* IE, the target eNB shall, if supported, use the
value contained in the *PDCP-SN Extended* IE in the *UL COUNT Value
Extended* IE or *PDCP-SN Length 18* IE of the *UL COUNT Value for PDCP
SN Length 18* IE instead of the value contained in the *PDCP-SN* IE of
the *UL COUNT value* IE.

For each bearer in ***E-RABs Subject to Status Transfer List*** IE
within the *eNB Status Transfer Transparent Container* IE received in
the MME STATUS TRANSFER message, the target eNB shall use *DL COUNT
value* IE for the first downlink packet for which there is no PDCP-SN
yet assigned. If the *DL COUNT Value Extended* IE or *DL COUNT Value for
PDCP SN Length 18* IE is included in the *E-RABs Subject to Status
Transfer Item* IE, the target eNB shall, if supported, use the *DL COUNT
Value Extended* IE or *DL COUNT Value for PDCP SN Length 18* IE instead
of the *DL COUNT value* IE.

If the *Receive Status Of UL PDCP SDUs* **IE or the *Receive Status Of
UL PDCP SDUs Extended* IE or the *Receive Status Of UL PDCP SDUs for
PDCP SN Length 18* IE is included for at least one bearer in the** *eNB
Status Transfer Transparent Container* **IE of the MME STATUS TRANSFER
message, the target eNB may use it in a Status Report message sent to
the UE over the radio interface.**

#### 8.4.7.3 Unsuccessful Operation

-----------------

### 8.6.1 General

The purpose of the NAS Transport procedure is to carry UE -- MME
signalling over the S1 Interface. The NAS messages are not interpreted
by the eNB, and their content is outside the scope of this
specification. The procedure may use an existing **UE-associated logical
S1-connection**. If no **UE-associated logical S1-connection** exists,
the establishment of the UE-associated logical S1-connection is
initiated (and may be established) as part of the procedure.

The NAS messages are transported in an IE of the INITIAL UE MESSAGE,
DOWNLINK NAS TRANSPORT, UPLINK NAS TRANSPORT or REROUTE NAS REQUEST
messages.

### 8.6.2 Successful Operations

#### 8.6.2.1 Initial UE Message

Figure 8.6.2.1-1: Initial UE Message procedure

When the eNB has received from the radio interface the first UL NAS
message transmitted via RRC message to be forwarded to an MME, the eNB
shall invoke the NAS Transport procedure and send the INITIAL UE MESSAGE
message to the MME including the NAS message as a *NAS-PDU* IE. The eNB
shall allocate a unique eNB UE S1AP ID to be used for the UE and the eNB
shall include this identity in the INITIAL UE MESSAGE message. In case
of network sharing, the selected PLMN is indicated by the *PLMN
Identity* IE within the *TAI* IE included in the INITIAL UE MESSAGE
message. When the eNB has received from the radio interface the *S-TMSI*
IE, it shall include it in the INITIAL UE MESSAGE message. If the eNB

the CN is performed due to an RRC connection establishment originating
from a CSG cell, the *CSG Id* IE shall be included in the INITIAL UE
MESSAGE message.

If the establishment of the UE-associated logical S1-connection towards
the CN is performed due to an RRC connection establishment originating
from a Hybrid cell, the *CSG Id* IE and the *Cell Access Mode* IE shall
be included in the INITIAL UE MESSAGE message.

If the establishment of the UE-associated logical S1-connection towards
the CN is performed due to an RRC connection establishment triggered by
a Relay Node as defined in TS 36.300 \[14\], the *GW Transport Layer
Address* IE and the *Relay Node Indicator* IE shall be included in the
INITIAL UE MESSAGE message.

If the eNB has a L-GW function for LIPA operation, it shall include the
*GW Transport Layer Address* IE in the INITIAL UE MESSAGE message.

If the *SIPTO L-GW Transport Layer Address* IE is received in the
INITIAL UE MESSAGE message, the MME shall, if supported, use it for
SIPTO\@LN operation as sepecified in TS 23.401 \[11\].

If the *LHN ID* IE is included in the INITIAL UE MESSAGE message, the
MME shall, if supported, use it as specified in TS 23.401 \[11\].

IAB-node.

#### 8.6.2.2 DOWNLINK NAS TRANSPORT

Figure 8.6.2.2-1: DOWNLINK NAS Transport Procedure

If the MME only needs to send a NAS message transparently via the eNB to
the UE and a UE-associated logical S1-connection exists for the UE or if
the MME has received the *eNB UE S1AP ID* IE in an INITIAL UE MESSAGE
message, the MME shall send a DOWNLINK NAS TRANSPORT message to the eNB
including the NAS message as a *NAS-PDU* IE. If the UE-associated
logical S1-connection is not established, the MME shall allocate a
unique **MME UE S1AP ID** to be used for the UE and include that in the
DOWNLINK NAS TRANSPORT message; *by receiving the **MME UE S1AP ID*** IE
in the DOWNLINK NAS TRANSPORT, the eNB establishes the UE-associated
logical S1-connection.

The *NAS-PDU* IE contains an MME -- UE message that is transferred
without interpretation in the eNB.

The DOWNLINK NAS TRANSPORT message may contain the *Handover Restriction
List* IE, which may contain roaming or access restrictions.

If the *Handover Restriction List* IE is contained in the DOWNLINK NAS
TRANSPORT message, the eNB shall store this information in the UE
context.

The eNB shall use the information in *Handover Restriction List* IE if
present in the DOWNLINK NAS TRANSPORT message to:

\- determine a target for subsequent mobility action for which the eNB
provides information about the target of the mobility action towards the
UE;

\- select a proper SCG during dual connectivity operation.

If the *Handover Restriction List* IE is not contained in the DOWNLINK
NAS TRANSPORT message and there is no previously stored Handover
restriction information, the eNB shall consider that no roaming and no
access restriction apply to the UE.

If the *Subscriber Profile ID for RAT/Frequency priority* IE is included

information is available, the *PSCell Information* IE shall be included
in the UPLINK NAS TRANSPORT message.

#### 8.6.2.4 NAS NON DELIVERY INDICATION

Figure 8.6.2.4-1: NAS NON DELIVERY INDICATION Procedure

When the eNB decides not to start the delivery of a NAS message that has
been received over a UE-associated logical S1-connection or the eNB is
unable to ensure that the message has been received by the UE, it shall
report the non-delivery of this NAS message by sending a NAS NON
DELIVERY INDICATION message to the MME including the non-delivered NAS
message within the *NAS-PDU* IE and an appropriate cause value within an
appropriate *Cause* IE, e.g., "S1 intra system Handover Triggered", "S1
inter system Handover Triggered" or "X2 Handover Triggered".

#### 8.6.2.4a NAS DELIVERY INDICATION

Figure 8.6.2.4a-1: NAS DELIVERY INDICATION Procedure

If the eNB has been requested by the MME to provide an indication upon
successful delivery of a downlink NAS PDU the eNB sends the NAS DELIVERY
INDICATION message to the MME upon successful delivery of the downlink
NAS PDU to the UE, see TS 23.401 \[11\].

#### 8.6.2.5 Reroute NAS Request

Figure 8.6.2.5-1: Reroute NAS Request Procedure

The purpose of the Reroute NAS Request procedure is to enable the MME to
request for a rerouting of the INITIAL UE MESSAGE message to the MME in
the indicated DCN.

The MME initiates the procedure by sending a REROUTE NAS REQUEST message
to the eNB. The eNB shall, if supported, reroute the INITIAL UE MESSAGE
message to the MME in the DCN indicated by the *MME Group ID* IE as
described in TS 23.401 \[11\].

message, then the eNB shall if supported, use it when selecting the MME
in the DCN as defined in TS 23.401 \[11\].

If the *UE Usage Type* IE is included in the REROUTE NAS REQUEST
message, then the eNB shall if supported, include it towards the
selected MME in the DCN as defined in TS 23.401 \[11\].

### 8.6.3 Unsuccessful Operation

Not applicable.

### 8.6.4 Abnormal Conditions

If the S-TMSI is not received by the MME in the INITIAL UE MESSAGE
message whereas expected, the MME shall consider the procedure as
failed.

The behaviour of an eNB that has been requested by the MME to provide an
indication upon successful delivery of a downlink NAS PDU to the UE and
that receives a DOWNLINK NAS TRANSPORT message before it has reported to
the MME either successful or unsuccessful delivery of the NAS PDU to the
UE, is not specified.

8.7 Management procedures
-------------------------

### 8.7.1 Reset

#### 8.7.1.1 General

The purpose of the Reset procedure is to initialise or re-initialise the
E-UTRAN, or part of E-UTRAN S1AP UE-related contexts, in the event of a
failure in the EPC or vice versa. This procedure does not affect the
application level configuration data exchanged during, e.g., the S1
Setup procedure.

The procedure uses non-UE associated signalling.

#### 8.7.1.2 Successful Operation

##### 8.7.1.2.1 Reset Procedure Initiated from the MME

Figure 8.7.1.2.1-1: Reset procedure initiated from the MME. Successful
operation.

In the event of a failure at the MME, which has resulted in the loss of
some or all transaction reference information, a RESET message shall be
sent to the eNB.

At reception of the RESET message the eNB shall release all allocated
resources on S1 and Uu related to the UE association(s) indicated
explicitly or implicitly in the RESET message and remove the indicated
UE contexts including S1AP ID.

After the eNB has released all assigned S1 resources and the UE S1AP IDs
for all indicated UE associations which can be used for new
UE-associated logical S1-connections over the S1 interface, the eNB
shall respond with the RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message. The eNB does not need
to wait for the release of radio resources to be completed before
returning the RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message.

*If the RESET message contains the UE-associated logical S1-connection
list IE, then:*

*- The eNB shall use the MME UE S1AP ID* IE and/or the *eNB UE S1AP ID*
IE to explicitly identify the UE association(s) to be reset.

\- The eNB shall include in the RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message, for each UE
association to be reset, the *UE-associated logical S1-connection Item*
IE in the *UE-associated logical S1-connection list* IE. The
*UE-associated logical S1-connection Item* IEs shall be in the same
order as received in the RESET message and shall include also unknown
UE-associated logical S1-connections. Empty *UE-associated logical
S1-connection Item* IEs, received in the RESET message, may be omitted
in the RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message.

\- If the *MME UE S1AP ID* IE is included in the *UE-associated logical
S1-connection Item* IE for a UE association, the eNB shall include the
*MME UE S1AP ID* IE in the corresponding *UE-associated logical
S1-connection Item* IE in the RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message.

\- If the ***eNB UE S1AP ID*** IE is included in the *UE-associated
logical S1-connection Item* IE for a UE association, the eNB shall
include the *eNB UE S1AP ID* IE in the corresponding *UE-associated
logical S1-connection Item* IE in the RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message.

**Interactions with other procedures:**

If the RESET message is received, any other ongoing procedure (except
for another Reset procedure) on the same S1 interface related to a UE
association, indicated explicitly or implicitly in the RESET message,
shall be aborted.

implicitly in the RESET message and remove the S1AP ID for the indicated
UE associations.

After the MME has released all assigned S1 resources and the UE S1AP IDs
for all indicated UE associations which can be used for new
UE-associated logical S1-connections over the S1 interface, the MME
shall respond with the RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message.

*If the RESET message contains the UE-associated logical S1-connection
list IE, then:*

*- The MME shall use the MME UE S1AP ID* IE and/or the *eNB UE S1AP ID*
IE to explicitly identify the UE association(s) to be reset.

\- The MME shall include in the RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message, for each UE
association to be reset, the *UE-associated logical S1-connection Item*
IE in the *UE-associated logical S1-connection list* IE. The
*UE-associated logical S1-connection Item* IEs shall be in the same
order as received in the RESET message and shall include also unknown
UE-associated logical S1-connections. Empty *UE-associated logical
S1-connection Item* IEs, received in the RESET message, may be omitted
in the RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message.

\- If the *MME UE S1AP ID* IE is included in the *UE-associated logical
S1-connection Item* IE for a UE association, the MME shall include the

S1-connection Item* IE in the RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message.

\- If the ***eNB UE S1AP ID*** IE is included in a *UE-associated
logical S1-connection Item* IE for a UE association, the MME shall
include the *eNB UE S1AP ID* IE in the corresponding *UE-associated
logical S1-connection Item* IE in the RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message.

**Interactions with other procedures:**

If the RESET message is received, any other ongoing procedure (except
for another Reset procedure) on the same S1 interface related to a UE
association, indicated explicitly or implicitly in the RESET message,
shall be aborted.

#### 8.7.1.3 Abnormal Conditions

##### 8.7.1.3.1 Abnormal Condition at the EPC

If the RESET message includes the *UE-associated logical S1-connection
list IE, but* neither the *MME UE S1AP ID* IE nor the *eNB UE S1AP ID*
IE is present for a *UE-associated logical S1-connection Item* IE, then
the MME shall ignore the *UE-associated logical S1-connection Item* IE.
The MME may return the empty *UE-associated logical S1-connection Item*
IE in the *UE-associated logical S1-connection list IE in the RESET
ACKNOWLEDGE message.*

##### 8.7.1.3.2 Abnormal Condition at the E-UTRAN

If the RESET message includes the *UE-associated logical S1-connection
list IE, but* neither the *MME UE S1AP ID* IE nor the *eNB UE S1AP ID*
IE is present for a *UE-associated logical S1-connection Item* IE, then
the eNB shall ignore the *UE-associated logical S1-connection Item* IE.
The eNB may return the empty *UE-associated logical S1-connection Item*
IE in the *UE-associated logical S1-connection list IE in the RESET
ACKNOWLEDGE message.*

##### 8.7.1.3.3 Crossing of Reset Messages

If a Reset procedure is ongoing in the eNB and the eNB receives a RESET
message from the peer entity on the same S1 interface related to one or
several UE associations previously requested to be reset, indicated
explicitly or implicitly in the received RESET message, the eNB shall
respond with the RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message as described in 8.7.1.2.1.

If a Reset procedure is ongoing in the MME and the MME receives a RESET
message from the peer entity on the same S1 interface related to one or
several UE associations previously requested to be reset, indicated
explicitly or implicitly in the received RESET message, the MME shall
respond with the RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message as described in 8.7.1.2.2.

### 8.7.2 Error Indication

#### 8.7.2.1 General

The Error Indication procedure is initiated by a node in order to report
detected errors in one incoming message, provided they cannot be
reported by an appropriate failure message.

If the error situation arises due to reception of a message utilising UE
associated signalling, then the Error Indication procedure uses UE
associated signalling. Otherwise the procedure uses non-UE associated
signalling.

#### 8.7.2.2 Successful Operation

Figure 8.7.2.2-1: Error Indication procedure, MME originated. Successful
operation.

Figure 8.7.2.2-2: Error Indication procedure, eNB originated. Successful
operation.

When the conditions defined in clause 10 are fulfilled, the Error
Indication procedure is initiated by an ERROR INDICATION message sent
from the receiving node.

The ERROR INDICATION message shall contain at least either the *Cause*
IE or the *Criticality Diagnostics* IE. In case the Error Indication
procedure is triggered by utilising UE associated signalling the *MME UE
S1AP ID* IE and the *eNB UE S1AP ID* IE shall be included in the ERROR
INDICATION message. If one or both of *MME UE S1AP ID* IE and the *eNB
UE S1AP ID* IE are not correct, the cause shall be set to appropriate
value, e.g., "Unknown or already allocated MME UE S1AP ID", "Unknown or
already allocated eNB UE S1AP ID" or "Unknown or inconsistent pair of UE
S1AP ID".

#### 8.7.2.3 Abnormal Conditions 

Not applicable.

### 8.7.3 S1 Setup 

#### 8.7.3.1 General

The purpose of the S1 Setup procedure is to exchange application level
data needed for the eNB and the MME to correctly interoperate on the S1
interface. This procedure shall be the first S1AP procedure triggered
after the TNL association has become operational. The procedure uses
non-UE associated signalling.

This procedure erases any existing application level configuration data
in the two nodes and replaces it by the one received and clears MME
overload state information at the eNB. If the eNB and MME do not agree
on retaining the UE Contexts this procedure also re-initialises the
E-UTRAN S1AP UE-related contexts (if any) and erases all related
signalling connections in the two nodes like a Reset procedure would do.
If the eNB initiating the S1 Setup procedure supports a CSG cell, the
procedure shall report the CSG ID(s) of the supported CSGs.

#### 8.7.3.2 Successful Operation

Figure 8.7.3.2-1: S1 Setup procedure: Successful Operation.

The eNB initiates the procedure by sending a S1 SETUP REQUEST message
including the appropriate data to the MME. The MME responds with a S1
SETUP RESPONSE message including the appropriate data.

The exchanged data shall be stored in respective node and used for the
duration of the TNL association. When this procedure is finished, the S1
interface is operational and other S1 messages can be exchanged.

If the eNB initiating the S1 SETUP procedure supports one (or more) CSG
cell(s), the S1 SETUP REQUEST message shall contain the CSG ID(s) of the
supported CSG(s).

If the S1 SETUP REQUEST message contains the *eNB Name* IE the MME may
use this IE as a human readable name of the eNB.

If the S1 SETUP RESPONSE message contains the *MME Name* IE the eNB may
use this IE as a human readable name of the MME.

If the *MME Relay Support Indicator* IE is included in the S1 SETUP
RESPONSE message, the eNB shall consider this information when selecting
an appropriate MME for the Relay Node.

If the *UE Retention Information* IE set to "ues-retained" was included
in the S1 SETUP REQUEST message, then the MME may accept the proposal to
retain the existing UE related contexts and signalling connections by
including the *UE Retention Information* IE set to "ues-retained" in the
S1 SETUP RESPONSE message.

If the *NB-IoT Default Paging DRX* IE is included in the S1 SETUP
REQUEST message, the MME will take it into account as specified in TS
36.300 \[14\].

If the *Connected en-gNB List* IE is included in the S1 SETUP REQUEST
message, the MME shall take it into account as specified in TS 36.300
\[14\].

If the S1 SETUP RESPONSE message contains the *ServedDCNs* IE then the
eNB shall, if supported, use it as defined in TS 23.401 \[11\].

If the S1 SETUP RESPONSE message contains the *GUMMEI Type* IE then the
eNB shall, if supported, use it to route the UE to the correct MME as
specified in TS 23.401 \[11\].

If the MME supports IAB, the MME shall include the *IAB Supported* IE in
the S1 SETUP RESPONSE message. If the *IAB Supported* IE is included in
the S1 SETUP RESPONSE message, the eNB shall, if supported, store this
information and use it for further MME selection for the IAB-MT.

#### 8.7.3.3 Unsuccessful Operation

Figure 8.7.3.3-1: S1 Setup procedure: Unsuccessful Operation.

If the MME cannot accept the setup, it should respond with a S1 SETUP
FAILURE and appropriate cause value.

If the S1 SETUP FAILURE message includes the *Time To Wait* IE, the eNB
shall wait at least for the indicated time before reinitiating the S1
setup towards the same MME.

#### 8.7.3.4 Abnormal Conditions

If the eNB initiates the procedure by sending a S1 SETUP REQUEST message
including the *PLMN Identity* IEs and none of the PLMNs provided by the
eNB is identified by the MME, then the MME shall reject the eNB S1 Setup
Request procedure with the appropriate cause value, e.g., "Unknown
PLMN".

If none of the RATs indicated by the eNB in the S1 SETUP REQUEST message
is supported by the MME, then the MME shall fail the S1 Setup procedure
with an appropriate cause value.

### 8.7.4 eNB Configuration Update 

#### 8.7.4.1 General

The purpose of the eNB Configuration Update procedure is to update
application level configuration data needed for the eNB and the MME to
interoperate correctly on the S1 interface. This procedure does not
affect existing UE-related contexts, if any.

Operation.

The eNB initiates the procedure by sending an ENB CONFIGURATION UPDATE
message to the MME including an appropriate set of updated configuration
data that it has just taken into operational use. The MME responds with
ENB CONFIGURATION UPDATE ACKNOWLEDGE message to acknowledge that it
successfully updated the configuration data. If information element(s)
is/are not included in the ENB CONFIGURATION UPDATE message, the MME
shall interpret that the corresponding configuration data is/are not
changed and shall continue to operate the S1 with the existing related
configuration data.

If the supported TA(s) is/are to be updated, the whole list of supported
TAs, including those that are not to be updated, shall be included in
the *Supported TAs* IE. The MME shall overwrite the whole list of TAs.

If the supported CSG ID(s) is/are to be updated, the whole list of
supported CSG IDs, including those that are not to be updated, shall be
included in the *CSG Id List* IE. The MME shall overwrite the whole list
of CSG Ids.

If the ENB CONFIGURATION UPDATE message contains the *eNB Name* IE, the
MME may use this IE as a human readable name of the eNB.

If the *Default Paging DRX* IE is included, the MME shall overwrite any
previously stored default paging DRX value for the eNB.

If the *NB-IoT Default Paging DRX* IE is included in the ENB
CONFIGURATION UPDATE message, the MME shall overwrite any previously
stored NB-IoT default paging DRX value for the eNB.

If the *Connected en-gNB to be Added List* IE is included in the ENB
CONFIGURATION UPDATE message, the MME shall replace, if applicable, any
previously received information for the concerned en-gNBs and take it
into account as specified in TS 36.300 \[14\].

If the *Connected en-gNB to be Removed List* IE is included in the ENB
CONFIGURATION UPDATE message, the MME shall remove any stored
information for the concerned en-gNBs.

The updated configuration data shall be stored in both the eNB and the
MME and used for the duration of the TNL association or until any
further update is triggered by the eNB.

The eNB may initiate a further eNB Configuration Update procedure only
after a previous eNB Configuration Update procedure has been completed.

#### 8.7.4.3 Unsuccessful Operation

Wait* IE, the eNB shall wait at least for the indicated time before
reinitiating the ENB Configuration Update procedure towards the same
MME. Both nodes shall continue to operate the S1 with their respective
configuration data.

#### 8.7.4.4 Abnormal Conditions

If the eNB after initiating eNB Configuration Update procedure receives
neither an ENB CONFIGURATION UPDATE ACKOWLEDGE nor an ENB CONFIGURATION
UPDATE FAILURE message, the eNB may reinitiate a further eNB
Configuration Update procedure towards the same MME, provided that the
content of the new ENB CONFIGURATION UPDATE message is identical to the
content of the previously unacknowledged ENB CONFIGURATION UPDATE
message.

### 8.7.5 MME Configuration Update 

#### 8.7.5.1 General

The purpose of the MME Configuration Update procedure is to update
application level configuration data needed for the eNB and MME to
interoperate correctly on the S1 interface. This procedure does not
affect existing UE-related contexts, if any.

#### 8.7.5.2 Successful Operation

corresponding to RRC cause \"emergency\" and \"mt-Access\" in TS 36.331
\[16\]), or

\- \"only permit RRC connection establishments for high priority
sessions and mobile terminated services\" (i.e., only permit traffic
corresponding to RRC cause \"highPriorityAccess\" and \"mt-Access\" in
TS 36.331 \[16\]), or

\- \"reject only RRC connection establishment for delay tolerant
access\" (i.e., only reject traffic corresponding to RRC cause
\"delayTolerantAccess\" in TS 36.331 \[16\]), or

> \- \"not accept RRC connection requests for data transmission from UEs
> that only support Control Plane CIoT EPS Optimisation\" (i.e. not
> accept traffic corresponding to RRC cause \"mo-data\" or
> \"delayTolerantAccess\" in TS 36.331 \[16\] for those UEs), or

\- \"only permit RRC connection establishments for high priority
sessions, exception reporting and mobile terminated services\" (i.e.,
only permit traffic corresponding to RRC cause \"highPriorityAccess\",
"mo-ExceptionData" and \"mt-Access\" in TS 36.331 \[16\]),

the eNB shall:

\- if the *Traffic Load Reduction Indication* IE is included in the
OVERLOAD START message and, if supported, reduce the signalling traffic
indicated as to be rejected by the indicated percentage,

\- otherwise ensure that only the signalling traffic not indicated as to
be rejected/not accepted is sent to the MME.

NOTE: When the Overload Action IE is set to \"only permit RRC connection
establishments for emergency sessions and mobile terminated services\",
emergency calls with RRC cause \"highPriorityAccess\" from high priority
users are rejected (see TS 24.301 \[24\]).

If the *GUMMEI List* IE is present, the eNB shall, if supported, use
this information to identify to which traffic the above defined
rejections shall be applied.

If an overload action is ongoing and the eNB receives a further OVERLOAD
START message, the eNB shall replace the ongoing overload action with
the newly requested one. If the *GUMMEI List* IE is present, the eNB

8.8 S1 CDMA2000 Tunnelling Procedures
-------------------------------------

### 8.8.1 General

The purpose of S1 CDMA2000 Tunnelling procedures is to carry CDMA2000
signalling between UE and CDMA2000 RAT over the S1 Interface. This
includes signalling for pre-registration of UE with CDMA2000 HRPD
network, signalling for handover preparation for handover from E-UTRAN
to CDMA2000 HRPD/1xRTT and pre-registration and paging of UE with
CDMA2000 1xRTT CS system. The CDMA2000 messages are not interpreted by
the eNB, and their content is outside the scope of this specification,
however, additional information may be sent along with the tunnelled
CDMA2000 message to assist the eNB and the MME in the tunnelling
procedure. These procedures use an established UE-associated logical
S1-connection.

The CDMA2000 messages are transported in an IE of the DOWNLINK S1
CDMA2000 TUNNELLING or UPLINK S1 CDMA2000 TUNNELLING messages.

### 8.8.2 Successful Operations

#### 8.8.2.1 Downlink S1 CDMA2000 Tunnelling

Figure 8.8.2.1-1: Downlink S1 CDMA2000 Tunnelling Procedure

If a CDMA2000 message needs to be sent from the MME to a given UE and a
UE-associated logical S1-connection exists for that given UE, the MME
should send a DOWNLINK S1 CDMA2000 TUNNELLING message to the eNB
including the CDMA2000 message in the *CDMA2000-PDU* IE. The eNB
forwards the received *CDMA2000-PDU* IE to the UE along with an
indication of the RAT Type associated with the *CDMA2000-PDU* IE based
on the *CDMA2000 RAT Type* IE.

If the MME receives handover status information along with the tunnelled
downlink CDMA2000 message, the MME should include the handover status
information in the *CDMA2000 HO Status* IE in the DOWNLINK S1 CDMA2000
TUNNELLING message.

If the DOWNLINK S1 CDMA2000 TUNNELLING message contains the *E-RABs
Subject to Forwarding List* IE, it indicates that DL forwarding is
available for the indicated E-RABs towards the tunnel endpoint
identified by the *DL GTP-TEID* IE for those E-RABs.

#### 8.8.2.2 Uplink S1 CDMA2000 Tunnelling

Figure 8.8.2.2-1: Uplink S1 CDMA2000 Tunnelling Procedure

When the eNB has received from the radio interface a CDMA2000 message to
be forwarded to the MME in which a UE-associated logical S1-connection
for a given UE exists, the eNB shall send the UPLINK S1 CDMA2000
TUNNELLING message to the MME including the CDMA2000 message in the
*CDMA2000-PDU* IE.

If the MME receives the *CDMA2000 HO Required Indication* IE set to
"true" in UPLINK S1 CDMA2000 TUNNELLING message, the MME shall send the
necessary handover preparation information to the CDMA2000 target RAT.

If the MME receives any of the *CDMA2000 1xRTT SRVCC Info* IE, or the
*CDMA2000 1xRTT RAND* IE in the UPLINK S1 CDMA2000 TUNNELLING message,
the MME shall forward the received information to the CDMA2000 1xRTT
RAT.

If the MME receives the *E-UTRAN Round Trip Delay Estimation Info* IE in
the UPLINK S1 CDMA2000 TUNNELLING message, the MME shall forward the
received information to the target HRPD access. The MME shall forward
the received *CDMA2000 Sector ID* IE and *CDMA2000-PDU* IE to the proper
destination node in the CDMA2000 RAT.

**Interactions with E-RAB Management procedures:**

If, after an UPLINK S1 CDMA2000 TUNNELLING message with *CDMA2000 HO
Required Indication* IE set to "true" is sent before the DOWNLINK S1
CDMA2000 TUNNELLING message with *CDMA2000 HO Status* IE is received,
the source eNB receives an MME initiated E-RAB Management procedure on
the same UE associated signalling connection, the source eNB shall
terminate the MME initiated E-RAB Management procedure by sending the
appropriate response message with an appropriate cause value, e.g., "S1
inter system Handover Triggered", to the MME.

### 8.8.3 Unsuccessful Operation

Not applicable

### 8.8.4 Abnormal Conditions

If the eNB receives at least one E-RAB ID included in the *E-RABs
Subject to Forwarding Items* IE without any associated DL GTP-TEID and
DL Transport Layer Address pair in the DOWNLINK S1 CDMA2000 TUNNELLING
message, the eNB shall consider it as a logical error and act as
described in subclause 10.4.

The eNB shall ignore the *UL GTP-TEID* IE and/or *UL Transport Layer
Address* IE in the *E-RABs Subject to Forwarding Items* IE, when the IEs
are included in the DOWNLINK S1 CDMA2000 TUNNELLING message.

8.9 UE Capability Info Indication
---------------------------------

### 8.9.1 General

The purpose of the UE Capability Info Indication procedure is to enable
the eNB to provide to the MME UE capability-related information.

### 8.9.2 Successful Operation

operation.

The eNB controlling a UE-associated logical S1-connection initiates the
procedure by sending a UE CAPABILITY INFO INDICATION message to the MME
including the UE capability information. The UE CAPABILITY INFO
INDICATION message may also include paging specific UE capability
information within the *UE Radio Capability for Paging* IE. The UE
capability information received by the MME shall replace previously
stored corresponding UE capability information in the MME for the UE, as
described in TS 23.401 \[11\].

If UE CAPABILITY INFO INDICATION message contains the *LTE-M indication*
IE, the MME shall, if supported, store this information in the UE
context and use it according to TS 23.401 \[11\].

If the UE indicates the support for UE Application Layer Measurement,
the eNB shall if supported include the UE Application Layer Measurement
Capability IE in the UE CAPABILITY INFO INDICATION message. The MME
shall, if supported, store and use thie information when initiating UE
Application Layer Measurement.

If UE CAPABILITY INFO INDICATION message contains the *UE Radio
Capability -- NR Format* IE, the MME shall, if supported, use it
according to TS 23.401 \[11\].

operation.

The MME initiates the procedure by sending a WRITE-REPLACE WARNING
REQUEST message to the eNB.

Upon receipt of the WRITE-REPLACE WARNING REQUEST, eNB shall prioritise
its resources to process the warning message.

If, in a certain area, broadcast of a warning message is already ongoing
and the eNB receives a WRITE-REPLACE WARNING REQUEST message with
*Message Identifier* IE and/or *Serial Number* IE which are different
from those in the warning message being broadcast, and if the
*Concurrent Warning Message Indicator* IE is not present, the eNB shall
replace the warning message being broadcast with the newly received one
for that area.

If the eNB receives a WRITE-REPLACE WARNING REQUEST message with a
warning message identified by the *Message Identifier* IE and *Serial
Number* IE and if there are no prior warning messages being broadcast in
any of warning areas indicated in the *Warning Area List* IE, the eNB
shall broadcast the received warning message for those area(s).

If, in a certain area, broadcast of one or more warning messages are
already ongoing and the eNB receives a WRITE-REPLACE WARNING REQUEST
message with a *Message Identifier* IE and/or *Serial Number* IE which
are different from those in any of the warning messages being broadcast,
and if the *Concurrent Warning Message Indictor* IE is present, the eNB
shall schedule the received warning message for broadcast, for that
area.

If the *Concurrent Warning Message Indicator* IE is present and if a
value "0" is received in the *Number of Broadcast Requested* IE, the eNB
shall broadcast the received warning message indefinitely until
requested otherwise to stop broadcasting, except if the *Repetition
Period* IE is set to "0".

If, in a certain area, broadcast of one or more warning messages are
already ongoing and the eNB receives a WRITE-REPLACE WARNING REQUEST
message with *Message Identifier* IE and *Serial Number* IE which
correspond to one of the warning messages already being broadcast in
that area, the eNB shall not start a new broadcast or replace an
existing one but it shall still reply by sending a WRITE-REPLACE WARNING
RESPONSE message which includes the *Broadcast Completed Area List* IE
set according to the ongoing broadcast.

If *Warning Area* *List* IE is not included in the WRITE-REPLACE WARNING
REQUEST message, the eNB shall broadcast the indicated message in all of
the cells within the eNB.

If *Warning Type* IE is included in WRITE-REPLACE WARNING REQUEST
message, the eNB shall broadcast the Primary Notification irrespective
of the setting of the *Repetition Period* IE and the *Number of
Broadcasts Requested* IE, and process the Primary Notification according
to TS 36.331 \[16\].

If the *Warning Security Information* IE is included in the
WRITE-REPLACE WARNING REQUEST message, the eNB shall include this
information together with the warning type in the Primary Notification.

If the *Data Coding Scheme* IE and the *Warning Message Contents* IE are
both included in the WRITE-REPLACE WARNING REQUEST message, the eNB
shall schedule a broadcast of the warning message according to the value
of the *Repetition Period* IE and *Number of Broadcasts Requested* IE
and process the warning message according to TS 36.331 \[16\].

If the *Warning Area Coordinates* IE is included in the WRITE-REPLACE
WARNING REQUEST message, the eNB shall include this information together
with the warning message being broadcast according to TS 36.331 \[16\].

The eNB acknowledges the WRITE-REPLACE WARNING REQUEST message by
sending a WRITE-REPLACE WARNING RESPONSE message to the MME.

If the *Broadcast Completed Area List* IE is not included in the
WRITE-REPLACE WARNING RESPONSE message, the MME shall consider that the
broadcast is unsuccessful in all the cells within the eNB.

If the *Extended Repetition Period* IE is included in the WRITE-REPLACE
WARNING REQUEST message, the eNB shall ignore the value in the
*Repetition Period* IE.

#### 8.12.1.3 Abnormal Conditions

If the *Concurrent Warning Message Indicator* IE is not present and if a
value "0" is received in the *Number of Broadcast Requested* IE, the eNB
shall not broadcast the received secondary notification.

If *Concurrent Warning Message Indicator* IE is included and if a value
"0" is received in the *Repetition Period* IE, the eNB shall not
broadcast the received warning message except if the *Number of
Broadcast Requested* IE is set to "1".

If *Concurrent Warning Message Indicator* IE is not included and if a
value "0" is received in the *Repetition Period* IE, the eNB shall not
broadcast the received secondary notification except if the *Number of
Broadcast Requested* IE is set to "1".

eNB.

If the eNB receives a KILL REQUEST message and broadcast of the warning
message identified by the *Message Identifier* and *Serial Number* IE is
ongoing in an area indicated within the *Warning Area List* IE, the eNB
shall stop broadcasting the warning message within that area and discard
the warning message for that area.

If the *Warning Area* *List* IE is not included in the KILL REQUEST
message, the eNB shall stop broadcasting and discard the warning message
identified by the *Message Identifier* IE and the *Serial Number* IE in
all of the cells in the eNB.

The eNB shall acknowledge the KILL REQUEST message by sending the KILL
RESPONSE message, with the *Message Identifier* IE and the *Serial
Number* IE copied from the KILL REQUEST message and shall, if there is
an area to report where an ongoing broadcast was stopped successfully,
include the *Broadcast Cancelled Area List* IE.

If an area included in the *Warning Area List* IE in the KILL REQUEST
message does not appear in the *Broadcast Cancelled Area List* IE, the
MME shall consider that the eNB had no ongoing broadcast to stop for the
same *Message Identifier* and *Serial Number* in that area.

If the *Broadcast Cancelled Area List* IE is not included in the KILL
RESPONSE message, the MME shall consider that the eNB had no ongoing
broadcast to stop for the same *Message Identifier* and *Serial Number*.

If the *Kill-all Warning Messages Indicator* IE is present in the KILL
REQUEST message, then the eNB shall stop broadcasting and discard all
warning messages for the area as indicated in the *Warning Area List* IE
or in all the cells of the eNB if the *Warning Area List* IE is not
included. The eNB shall acknowledge the KILL REQUEST message by sending
the KILL RESPONSE message, with the *Message Identifier* IE and the

sent from the MME to the eNB.

If the eNB receives, in the *SON Configuration Transfer* IE or the
*EN-DC SON Configuration Transfer* IE, the *SON Information* IE
containing the *SON Information Request* IE, it may transfer back the
requested information either towards the eNB indicated in the *Source
eNB-ID* IE of the *SON Configuration Transfer* IE or towards the eNB
indicated in the *Source eNB-ID* IE of the *EN-DC SON Configuration
Transfer* IE by initiating the eNB Configuration Transfer procedure. If
the *X2 TNL Configuration Info* IE contains the *eNB Indirect X2
Transport Layer Addresses* IE, the eNB may use it for the X2 TNL
establishment, and may transfer back the received eNB Indirect X2
Transport Layer Addresses towards the eNB indicated in the *Source
eNB-ID* IE of the *SON Configuration Transfer* IE by initiating the eNB
Configuration Transfer procedure or towards the eNB indicated in the
*Source eNB-ID* IE of the *EN-DC SON Configuration Transfer* IE by
initiating the eNB Configuration Transfer procedure.

If the eNB receives, in the *SON Configuration Transfer* IE, the *X2 TNL
Configuration Info* IE containing the *eNB X2 Extended Transport Layer
Addresses* IE, it may use it as part of its ACL functionality
configuration actions, if such ACL functionality is deployed.

If the eNB receives, in the *SON Configuration Transfer* IE or the
*EN-DC SON Configuration Transfer* IE, the *SON Information* IE
containing the *SON Information Reply* IE including the *X2 TNL
Configuration Info* IE as an answer to a former request, it may use it
to initiate the X2 TNL establishment. If the *X2 TNL Configuration Info*
IE contains the *eNB Indirect X2 Transport Layer Addresses* IE, the eNB
may use it for the X2 TNL establishment.

In case the *IP-Sec Transport Layer Address* IE is present and the *GTP
Transport Layer Addresses* IE within the *eNB X2 Extended Transport
Layer Addresses* IE is not empty, GTP traffic is conveyed within an
IP-Sec tunnel terminated at the IP-Sec tunnel end point given in by the
*IP-Sec Transport Layer Address* IE.

In case the *IP-Sec Transport Layer Address* IE is not present, GTP
traffic is terminated at the end points given by the list of addresses
in *eNB* *GTP Transport Layer Addresses* IE within the *eNB X2 Extended
Transport Layer Addresses* IE.

In case the *eNB* *GTP Transport Layer Addresses* IE is empty and the
*IP-Sec Transport Layer Address* IE is present, SCTP traffic is conveyed
within an IP-Sec tunnel terminated at the IP-Sec tunnel end point given
in the *IP-Sec Transport Layer Address* IE, within the *eNB X2 Extended
Transport Layer Addresses* IE.

If the eNB is configured to use one IPsec tunnel for all S1 and X2
traffic (IPsec star topology) then the traffic to the peer eNB shall be
routed through this IPsec tunnel and the *IP-Sec Transport Layer
Address* IE shall be ignored.

If the eNB receives the *SON Information* IE containing the *SON
Information Reply* IE including the *Time Synchronisation Info* IE as an
answer to a former request, it may use it for over-the-air
synchronisation by means of network listening and for triggering muting
activation request.

If the eNB receives the *SON Information* IE containing the *SON
Information Report* IE, it may use it as specified in TS 36.300 \[14\].

containing the *Inter-system SON Information Report* IE, it may use it
as specified in TS 38.300 \[45\] or in TS 36.300 \[14\].

If the eNB receives the *SON Information* IE containing the *SON
Information Request* IE set to "Activate Muting", the eNB should
consider activating for over-the-air synchronisation by means of network
listening, taking into account information on the selected source of
synchronisation cell and the cells as indicated by the *Aggressor E-CGI
List* IE. In case the *Aggressor E-CGI List* IE is not present, the eNB
may consider the request applicable to all cells.

If the eNB receives the *SON Information* IE containing the *SON
Information Reply* IE including the *Muting Pattern Information* IE as
an answer to a former request, it may use it for over-the-air
synchronisation by means of network listening. The *Muting Pattern
Information* IE may apply to all cells that were requested to mute.

If the eNB receives the *SON Information* IE containing the *SON
Information Request* IE set to "Deactivate Muting", the eNB may consider
deactivating muting for over-the-air synchronisation that was activated
by a former muting request from the corresponding eNB.

9.2 Information Element Definitions
-----------------------------------

### 9.2.0 General

Subclause 9.2 presents the S1AP IE definitions in tabular format. The
corresponding ASN.1 definition is presented in subclause 9.3. In case
there is contradiction between the tabular format in subclause 9.2 and
the ASN.1 definition, the ASN.1 shall take precedence, except for the
definition of conditions for the presence of conditional elements, where
the tabular format shall take precedence.

The messages have been defined in accordance to the guidelines specified
in TR 25.921 \[40\].

When specifying information elements which are to be represented by
bitstrings, if not otherwise specifically stated in the semantics
description of the concerned IE or elsewhere, the following principle
applies with regards to the ordering of bits:

\- The first bit (leftmost bit) contains the most significant bit (MSB);

\- The last bit (rightmost bit) contains the least significant bit
(LSB);

\- When importing bitstrings from other specifications, the first bit of
the bitstring contains the first bit of the concerned information;

### 9.2.1 Radio Network Layer Related IEs

#### 9.2.1.1 Message Type

The *Message Type* IE uniquely identifies the message being sent. It is
mandatory for all messages.

The meaning of the different cause values is described in the following
table. In general, "not supported" cause values indicate that the
related capability is missing. On the other hand, "not available" cause
values indicate that the related capability is present, but insufficient
resources were available to perform the requested action.

#### 9.2.1.5 Source ID

Void.

#### 9.2.1.6 Target ID

The *Target ID* IE identifies the target for the handover. The target ID
may be, e.g., the target Global eNB-ID (for intra SAE/LTE), the RNC-ID
(for SAE/LTE-UMTS handover) or the Cell Global ID of the handover target
(in case of SAE/LTE to GERAN A/Gb mode handover).

#### 9.2.1.7 Source eNB to Target eNB Transparent Container

The *Source eNB to target eNB Transparent Container* IE is an
information element that is produced by the source eNB and is
transmitted to the target eNB. For inter-system handovers to E-UTRAN,
the IE is transmitted from the external handover source to the target
eNB.

This IE is transparent to the EPC.

#### 9.2.1.8 Target eNB to Source eNB Transparent Container

The *Target eNB to Source eNB Transparent Container* IE is an
information element that is produced by the target eNB and is
transmitted to the source eNB. For inter-system handovers to E-UTRAN,
the IE is transmitted from the target eNB to the external relocation
source.

This IE is transparent to EPC.

#### 9.2.1.19 Bit Rate

This IE indicates the number of bits delivered by E-UTRAN in UL or to
E-UTRAN in DL or by UE in sidelink within a period of time, divided by
the duration of the period. It is used, for example, to indicate the
maximum or guaranteed bit rate for a GBR bearer, or an aggregated
maximum bit rate.

#### 9.2.1.22 Handover Restriction List

This IE defines roaming or access restrictions for subsequent mobility
action for which the eNB provides information about the target of the
mobility action towards the UE, e.g., handover and CCO, or for SCG
selection during dual connectivity operation. If the eNB receives the
*Handover Restriction List* IE, it shall overwrite previously received
restriction information.

#### 9.2.1.26 Security Context

The purpose of the *Security Context* IE is to provide security related
parameters to the eNB which are used to derive security keys for user
plane traffic and RRC signalling messages and for security parameter
generation for subsequent X2 or intra eNB Handovers, or for the security
parameters for the current S1 Handover. For intra LTE S1 Handover one

9.3 Message and Information Element Abstract Syntax (with ASN.1)
----------------------------------------------------------------

### 9.3.0 General

S1AP ASN.1 definition conforms to ITU-T Rec. X.691 \[4\], ITU-T Rec.
X.680 \[5\] and ITU-T Rec. X.681 \[6\].

The ASN.1 definition specifies the structure and content of S1AP
messages. S1AP messages can contain any IEs specified in the object set
definitions for that message without the order or number of occurrence
being restricted by ASN.1. However, for this version of the standard, a
sending entity shall construct a S1AP message according to the PDU
definitions module and with the following additional rules:

\- IEs shall be ordered (in an IE container) in the order they appear in
object set definitions.

\- Object set definitions specify how many times IEs may appear. An IE
shall appear exactly once if the presence field in an object has value
\"mandatory\". An IE may appear at most once if the presence field in an
object has value \"optional\" or \"conditional\". If in a tabular format
there is multiplicity specified for an IE (i.e., an IE list) then in the
corresponding ASN.1 definition the list definition is separated into two
parts. The first part defines an IE container list where the list
elements reside. The second part defines list elements. The IE container
list appears as an IE of its own. For this version of the standard an IE
container list may contain only one kind of list elements.

NOTE: In the above "IE" means an IE in the object set with an explicit
ID. If one IE needs to appear more than once in one object set, then the
different occurrences will have different IE IDs.

If a S1AP message that is not constructed as defined above is received,
this shall be considered as Abstract Syntax Error, and the message shall
be handled as defined for Abstract Syntax Error in subclause 10.3.6.

Subclause 9.3 presents the Abstract Syntax of S1AP protocol with ASN.1.
In case there is contradiction between the ASN.1 definition in this
subclause and the tabular format in subclause 9.1 and 9.2, the ASN.1
shall take precedence, except for the definition of conditions for the
presence of conditional elements, where the tabular format shall take
precedence.

### 9.3.1 Usage of private message mechanism for non-standard use

The private message mechanism for non-standard use may be used:

\- for special operator- (and/or vendor) specific features considered
not to be part of the basic functionality, i.e., the functionality
required for a complete and high-quality specification in order to
guarantee multivendor interoperability;

\- by vendors for research purposes, e.g., to implement and evaluate new
algorithms/features before such features are proposed for
standardisation.

The private message mechanism shall not be used for basic functionality.
Such functionality shall be standardised.

 10 Handling of Unknown, Unforeseen and Erroneous Protocol Data
==============================================================

10.1 General
------------

Protocol Error cases can be divided into three classes:

\- Transfer Syntax Error.

\- Abstract Syntax Error.

\- Logical Error.

Protocol errors can occur in the following functions within a receiving
node:

Figure 10.1-1: Protocol Errors in S1AP.

The information stated in subclauses 10.2, 10.3 and 10.4, to be included
in the message used when reporting an error, is what at minimum shall be
included. Other optional information elements within the message may
also be included, if available. This is also valid for the case when the
reporting is done with a response message. The latter is an exception to
what is stated in subclause 4.1.

10.2 Transfer Syntax Error
--------------------------

A Transfer Syntax Error occurs when the receiver is not able to decode
the received physical message. Transfer syntax errors are always
detected in the process of ASN.1 decoding. If a Transfer Syntax Error
occurs, the receiver should initiate Error Indication procedure with
appropriate cause value for the Transfer Syntax protocol error.

Examples for Transfer Syntax Errors are:

\- Violation of value ranges in ASN.1 definition of messages. E.g., if
an IE has a defined value range of 0 to 10 (ASN.1: INTEGER (0..10)), and
12 will be received, then this will be treated as a transfer syntax
error.

\- Violation in list element constraints. E.g., if a list is defined as
containing 1 to 10 elements, and 12 elements will be received, than this
case will be handled as a transfer syntax error.

\- Missing mandatory elements in ASN.1 SEQUENCE definitions (as sent by
the originator of the message).

\- Wrong order of elements in ASN.1 SEQUENCE definitions (as sent by the
originator of the message).

10.3 Abstract Syntax Error
--------------------------

### 10.3.1 General

An Abstract Syntax Error occurs when the receiving functional S1AP
entity:

1\. receives IEs or IE groups that cannot be understood (unknown IE ID);

2\. receives IEs for which the logical range is violated (e.g., ASN.1
definition: 0 to 15, the logical range is 0 to 10, while values 11 to 15
are undefined), and 12 will be received; this case will be handled as an
abstract syntax error using criticality information sent by the
originator of the message);

3\. does not receive IEs or IE groups but according to the specified
presence of the concerning object, the IEs or IE groups should have been
present in the received message.

4\. receives IEs or IE groups that are defined to be part of that
message in wrong order or with too many occurrences of the same IE or IE
group;

5\. receives IEs or IE groups but according to the conditional presence
of the concerning object and the specified condition, the IEs or IE
groups should not have been present in the received message.

Cases 1 and 2 (not comprehended IE/IE group) are handled based on
received Criticality information. Case 3 (missing IE/IE group) is
handled based on Criticality information and Presence information for
the missing IE/IE group specified in the version of the specification
used by the receiver. Case 4 (IEs or IE groups in wrong order or with
too many occurrences) and Case 5 (erroneously present conditional IEs or
IE groups) result in rejecting the procedure.

If an Abstract Syntax Error occurs, the receiver shall read the
remaining message and shall then for each detected Abstract Syntax Error
that belong to cases 1-3 act according to the Criticality Information
and Presence Information for the IE/IE group due to which Abstract
Syntax Error occurred in accordance with subclauses 10.3.4 and 10.3.5.
The handling of cases 4 and 5 is specified in subclause 10.3.6.

### 10.3.2 Criticality Information

In the S1AP messages there is criticality information set for individual
IEs and/or IE groups. This criticality information instructs the
receiver how to act when receiving an IE or an IE group that is not
comprehended, i.e., the entire item (IE or IE group) which is not (fully
or partially) comprehended shall be treated in accordance with its own
criticality information as specified in subclause 10.3.4.

In addition, the criticality information is used in case of the missing
IE/IE group abstract syntax error (see subclause 10.3.5).

The receiving node shall take different actions depending on the value
of the Criticality Information. The three possible values of the
Criticality Information for an IE/IE group are:

\- Reject IE.

\- Ignore IE and Notify Sender.

\- Ignore IE.

The following rules restrict when a receiving entity may consider an IE,
an IE group, or an EP not comprehended (not implemented), and when
action based on criticality information is applicable:

1\. IE or IE group: When one new or modified IE or IE group is
implemented for one EP from a standard version, then other new or
modified IEs or IE groups specified for that EP in that standard version
shall be considered comprehended by a receiving entity (some may still
remain unsupported).

2\. EP: The comprehension of different EPs within a standard version or
between different standard versions is not mandated. Any EP that is not
supported may be considered not comprehended, even if another EP from
that standard version is comprehended, and action based on criticality
shall be applied.

### 10.3.3 Presence Information

For many IEs/IE groups which are optional according to the ASN.1
transfer syntax, S1AP specifies separately if the presence of these
IEs/IE groups is optional or mandatory with respect to RNS application
by means of the presence field of the concerning object of class
S1AP-PROTOCOL-IES, S1AP-PROTOCOL-IES-PAIR, S1AP-PROTOCOL-EXTENSION or
S1AP-PRIVATE-IES.

The presence field of the indicated classes supports three values:

1\. Optional;

2\. Conditional;

3\. Mandatory.

If an IE/IE group is not included in a received message and the presence
of the IE/IE group is mandatory or the presence is conditional and the
condition is true according to the version of the specification used by
the receiver, an abstract syntax error occurs due to a missing IE/IE
group.

If an IE/IE group is included in a received message and the presence of
the IE/IE group is conditional and the condition is false according to
the version of the specification used by the receiver, an abstract
syntax error occurs due to this erroneously present conditional IE/IE
group.

### 10.3.4 Not comprehended IE/IE group

#### 10.3.4.1 Procedure Code

The receiving node shall treat the different types of received
criticality information of the *Procedure Code* IE according to the
following:

**Reject IE:**

\- If a message is received with a *Procedure Code* IE marked with
"*Reject IE*" which the receiving node does not comprehend, the
receiving node shall reject the procedure using the Error Indication
procedure.

**Ignore IE and Notify Sender:**

\- If a message is received with a *Procedure Code* IE marked with
"*Ignore IE and Notify Sender*" which the receiving node does not
comprehend, the receiving node shall ignore the procedure and initiate
the Error Indication procedure.

**Ignore IE:**

\- If a message is received with a *Procedure Code* IE marked with
"*Ignore IE*" which the receiving node does not comprehend, the
receiving node shall ignore the procedure.

When using the Error Indication procedure to reject a procedure or to
report an ignored procedure it shall include the *Procedure Code* IE,
the *Triggering Message* IE, and the *Procedure Criticality* IE in the
*Criticality Diagnostics* IE.

#### 10.3.4.1A Type of Message

When the receiving node cannot decode the *Type of Message* IE, the
Error Indication procedure shall be initiated with an appropriate cause
value.

#### 10.3.4.2 IEs other than the Procedure Code and Type of Message

The receiving node shall treat the different types of received
criticality information of an IE/IE group other than the *Procedure
Code* IE and *Type of Message* IE according to the following:

**Reject IE:**

\- If a message *initiating* a procedure is received containing one or
more IEs/IE group marked with "*Reject IE*" which the receiving node
does not comprehend; none of the functional requests of the message
shall be executed. The receiving node shall reject the procedure and
report the rejection of one or more IEs/IE group using the message
normally used to report unsuccessful outcome of the procedure. In case
the information received in the initiating message was insufficient to
determine a value for all IEs that are required to be present in the
message used to report the unsuccessful outcome of the procedure, the
receiving node shall instead terminate the procedure and initiate the
Error Indication procedure.

\- If a message *initiating* a procedure that does not have a message to
report unsuccessful outcome is received containing one or more IEs/IE
groups marked with "*Reject IE*" which the receiving node does not
comprehend, the receiving node shall terminate the procedure and
initiate the Error Indication procedure.

\- If a *response* message is received containing one or more IEs marked
with "*Reject IE*", that the receiving node does not comprehend, the
receiving node shall consider the procedure as unsuccessfully terminated
and initiate local error handling.

**Ignore IE and Notify Sender:**

\- If a message *initiating* a procedure is received containing one or
more IEs/IE groups marked with "*Ignore IE and Notify Sender*" which the
receiving node does not comprehend, the receiving node shall ignore the
content of the not comprehended IEs/IE groups, continue with the
procedure as if the not comprehended IEs/IE groups were not received
(except for the reporting) using the understood IEs/IE groups, and
report in the response message of the procedure that one or more IEs/IE
groups have been ignored. In case the information received in the
initiating message was insufficient to determine a value for all IEs
that are required to be present in the response message, the receiving
node shall instead terminate the procedure and initiate the Error
Indication procedure.

\- if a message *initiating* a procedure that does not have a message to
report the outcome of the procedure is received containing one or more
IEs/IE groups marked with "*Ignore IE and Notify Sender*" which the
receiving node does not comprehend, the receiving node shall ignore the
content of the not comprehended IEs/IE groups, continue with the
procedure as if the not comprehended IEs/IE groups were not received
(except for the reporting) using the understood IEs/IE groups, and
initiate the Error Indication procedure to report that one or more
IEs/IE groups have been ignored.

\- If a *response* message is received containing one or more IEs/IE
groups marked with "*Ignore IE and Notify Sender*" which the receiving
node does not comprehend, the receiving node shall ignore the content of
the not comprehended IEs/IE groups, continue with the procedure as if
the not comprehended IEs/IE groups were not received (except for the
reporting) using the understood IEs/IE groups and initiate the Error
Indication procedure.

**Ignore IE:**

\- If a message *initiating* a procedure is received containing one or
more IEs/IE groups marked with "*Ignore IE*" which the receiving node
does not comprehend, the receiving node shall ignore the content of the
not comprehended IEs/IE groups and continue with the procedure as if the
not comprehended IEs/IE groups were not received using the understood
IEs/IE groups.

\- If a *response* message is received containing one or more IEs/IE
groups marked with "*Ignore IE*" which the receiving node does not
comprehend, the receiving node shall ignore the content of the not
comprehended IEs/IE groups and continue with the procedure as if the not
comprehended IEs/IE groups were not received using the understood IEs/IE
groups.

When reporting not comprehended IEs/IE groups marked with "*Reject IE*"
or "*Ignore IE and Notify Sender*" using a response message defined for
the procedure, the *Information Element Criticality Diagnostics* IE
shall be included in the *Criticality Diagnostics* IE for each reported
IE/IE group.

When reporting not comprehended IEs/IE groups marked with "*Reject IE*"
or "*Ignore IE and Notify Sender*" using the Error Indication procedure,
the *Procedure Code* IE, the *Triggering Message* IE, *Procedure
Criticality* IE, and the *Information Element Criticality Diagnostics*
IE shall be included in the *Criticality Diagnostics* IE for each
reported IE/IE group.

### 10.3.5 Missing IE or IE group

The receiving node shall treat the missing IE/IE group according to the
criticality information for the missing IE/IE group in the received
message specified in the version of this specification used by the
receiver:

**Reject IE:**

\- if a received message *initiating* a procedure is missing one or more
IEs/IE groups with specified criticality "*Reject IE*"; none of the
functional requests of the message shall be executed. The receiving node
shall reject the procedure and report the missing IEs/IE groups using
the message normally used to report unsuccessful outcome of the
procedure. In case the information received in the initiating message
was insufficient to determine a value for all IEs that are required to
be present in the message used to report the unsuccessful outcome of the
procedure, the receiving node shall instead terminate the procedure and
initiate the Error Indication procedure.

\- if a received message *initiating* a procedure that does not have a
message to report unsuccessful outcome is missing one or more IEs/IE
groups with specified criticality "*Reject IE*", the receiving node
shall terminate the procedure and initiate the Error Indication
procedure.

\- if a received *response* message is missing one or more IEs/IE groups
with specified criticality "*Reject IE*, the receiving node shall
consider the procedure as unsuccessfully terminated and initiate local
error handling.

**Ignore IE and Notify Sender:**

\- if a received message *initiating* a procedure is missing one or more
IEs/IE groups with specified criticality "*Ignore IE and Notify
Sender*", the receiving node shall ignore that those IEs are missing and
continue with the procedure based on the other IEs/IE groups present in
the message and report in the response message of the procedure that one
or more IEs/IE groups were missing. In case the information received in
the initiating message was insufficient to determine a value for all IEs
that are required to be present in the response message, the receiving
node shall instead terminate the procedure and initiate the Error
Indication procedure.

\- if a received message *initiating* a procedure that does not have a
message to report the outcome of the procedure is missing one or more
IEs/IE groups with specified criticality "*Ignore IE and Notify
Sender*", the receiving node shall ignore that those IEs are missing and
continue with the procedure based on the other IEs/IE groups present in
the message and initiate the Error Indication procedure to report that
one or more IEs/IE groups were missing.

\- if a received *response* message is missing one or more IEs/IE groups
with specified criticality "*Ignore IE and Notify Sender*", the
receiving node shall ignore that those IEs are missing and continue with
the procedure based on the other IEs/IE groups present in the message
and initiate the Error Indication procedure to report that one or more
IEs/IE groups were missing.

**Ignore IE:**

\- if a received message *initiating* a procedure is missing one or more
IEs/IE groups with specified criticality "*Ignore IE*", the receiving
node shall ignore that those IEs are missing and continue with the
procedure based on the other IEs/IE groups present in the message.

\- if a received *response* message is missing one or more IEs/IE groups
with specified criticality "*Ignore IE*", the receiving node shall
ignore that those IEs/IE groups are missing and continue with the
procedure based on the other IEs/IE groups present in the message.

When reporting missing IEs/IE groups with specified criticality "*Reject
IE*" or "*Ignore IE and Notify Sender*" using a response message defined
for the procedure, the *Information Element Criticality Diagnostics* IE
shall be included in the *Criticality Diagnostics* IE for each reported
IE/IE group.

When reporting missing IEs/IE groups with specified criticality "*Reject
IE*" or "*Ignore IE and Notify Sender*" using the Error Indication
procedure, the *Procedure Code* IE, the *Triggering Message* IE,
*Procedure Criticality* IE, and the *Information Element Criticality
Diagnostics* IE shall be included in the *Criticality Diagnostics* IE
for each reported IE/IE group.

### 10.3.6 IEs or IE groups received in wrong order or with too many occurrences or erroneously present

If a message with IEs or IE groups in wrong order or with too many
occurrences is received or if IEs or IE groups with a conditional
presence are present when the condition is not met (i.e., erroneously
present), the receiving node shall behave according to the following:

\- If a message *initiating* a procedure is received containing IEs or
IE groups in wrong order or with too many occurrences or erroneously
present, none of the functional requests of the message shall be
executed. The receiving node shall reject the procedure and report the
cause value "Abstract Syntax Error (Falsely Constructed Message)" using
the message normally used to report unsuccessful outcome of the
procedure. In case the information received in the initiating message
was insufficient to determine a value for all IEs that are required to
be present in the message used to report the unsuccessful outcome of the
procedure, the receiving node shall instead terminate the procedure and
initiate the Error Indication procedure.

\- If a message *initiating* a procedure that does not have a message to
report unsuccessful outcome is received containing IEs or IE groups in
wrong order or with too many occurrences or erroneously present, the
receiving node shall terminate the procedure and initiate the Error
Indication procedure, and use cause value "Abstract Syntax Error
(Falsely Constructed Message)".

\- If a *response* message is received containing IEs or IE groups in
wrong order or with too many occurrences or erroneously present, the
receiving node shall consider the procedure as unsuccessfully terminated
and initiate local error handling.

When determining the correct order only the IEs specified in the
specification version used by the receiver shall be considered.

10.4 Logical Error
------------------

Logical error situations occur when a message is comprehended correctly,
but the information contained within the message is not valid (i.e.,
semantic error), or describes a procedure which is not compatible with
the state of the receiver. In these conditions, the following behaviour
shall be performed (unless otherwise specified) as defined by the class
of the elementary procedure, irrespective of the criticality information
of the IEs/IE groups containing the erroneous values.

**[Class 1:]{.underline}**

Where the logical error occurs in a request message of a class 1
procedure, and the procedure has a message to report this unsuccessful
outcome, this message shall be sent with an appropriate cause value.
Typical cause values are:

\- Semantic Error.

\- Message not compatible with receiver state.

Where the logical error is contained in a request message of a class 1
procedure, and the procedure does not have a message to report this
unsuccessful outcome, the procedure shall be terminated and the Error
Indication procedure shall be initiated with an appropriate cause value.
The *Procedure Code* IE and the *Triggering Message* IE within the
*Criticality Diagnostics* IE shall then be included in order to identify
the message containing the logical error.

Where the logical error exists in a response message of a class 1
procedure, the procedure shall be considered as unsuccessfully
terminated and local error handling shall be initiated.

**[Class 2:]{.underline}**

Where the logical error occurs in a message of a class 2 procedure, the
procedure shall be terminated and the Error Indication procedure shall
be initiated with an appropriate cause value. The *Procedure Code* IE
and the *Triggering Message* IE within the *Criticality Diagnostics* IE
shall then be included in order to identify the message containing the
logical error.

10.5 Exceptions
---------------

The error handling for all the cases described hereafter shall take
precedence over any other error handling described in the other
subclauses of clause 10.

\- If any type of error (Transfer Syntax Error, Abstract Syntax Error or
Logical Error) is detected in the ERROR INDICATION message, it shall not
trigger the Error Indication procedure in the receiving Node but local
error handling.

\- In case a response message or Error Indication message needs to be
returned, but the information necessary to determine the receiver of
that message is missing, the procedure shall be considered as
unsuccessfully terminated and local error handling shall be initiated.

\- If an error that terminates a procedure occurs, the returned cause
value shall reflect the error that caused the termination of the
procedure even if one or more abstract syntax errors with criticality
"ignore and notify" have earlier occurred within the same procedure.

\- If an AP ID error is detected, the error handling as described in
subclause 10.6 shall be applied.

10.6 Handling of AP ID
----------------------

NOTE: **The "first message", the "first returned message" and the "last
message" as used below correspond to messages for a UE-associated
logical connection. The "first message" has a new AP ID from the sending
node and the "first returned message" is the first response message,
which has a new APID from the node sending the "first returned message".
Thereafter the two APIDs are included in all messages over the**
UE-associated logical connection unless otherwise allowed by the
specification. The "last message" is a message sent by a node in order
to complete the termination of a given UE-associated logical connection,
such that no other messages for the same connection are expected in
either direction.

**If a node receives a first message that includes a remote AP ID which
is erroneous, e.g., an AP ID which has been stored previously for
another** UE-associated logical connection for the same peer node**, the
receiving node shall initiate an Error Indication procedure with
inclusion of only the previously received AP ID from the peer node and
an appropriate cause value. In this case, both nodes shall initiate a
local release of any established** UE-associated logical connection
**having the erroneous AP ID as local or remote identifier.**

**If a node receives a first returned message that includes a remote AP
ID which has been stored previously for another UE-associated logical
connection for the same peer node, or that includes an AP ID pair which
is inconsistent (e.g., the local AP ID is unknown or already allocated
to another UE-associated logical connection), the receiving node shall
initiate an Error Indication procedure with inclusion of the received AP
IDs from the peer node and an appropriate cause value. Both nodes shall
initiate a local release of any established** UE-associated logical
connection **(for the same S1 interface) having these AP IDs as local or
remote identifier.**

**If a node receives a message (other than the first or first returned
messages) that includes AP ID(s) identifying a logical connection which
is unknown to the node (for the same S1 interface):**

\- if this message is not the last message for this UE-associated
logical connection, the node shall initiate an Error Indication
procedure with inclusion of the received AP ID(s) from the peer node and
an appropriate cause value. Both nodes shall initiate a local release of
any established UE-associated logical connection (for the same S1
interface) having the erroneous AP ID(s) as local or remote identifier.

\- if this message is the last message for this UE-associated logical
connection, the receiving node shall initiate a local release of any
established UE-associated logical connection (for the same S1 interface)
that have either the local or remote AP ID(s) as identifiers.

########  Annex A (informative): S1AP Transparent containers content

Transparent containers are used in order to transfer information from
one RAN node to another RAN node. Depending on the particular scenario
the behaviour of both involved RAN nodes may be either specified
according to the same radio system or according to different radio
systems. During an inter-system handover the source RAN node has to
adopt to the target RAN node and its requirements. Therefore the
container content is encoded according to the rules which are specified
for the target radio system.

In S1AP, there is a single transparent container defined for
transporting information from the source to the target RAN node and a
single transparent container for transporting information from the
target to the source RAN node during handover preparation: the *Source
to Target Transparent Container* IE and the *Target to Source
Transparent Container* IE, which may carry either NG-RAN, E-UTRAN, UTRAN
or GERAN specific information.

NOTE: The definition of generic transparent containers for handover
purposes allows to transport them through the core network in a
RAT-agnostic way.

In subclause 8.4.1.2, it is described how the transparent container
shall be encoded with respect to the scenario in which it is used.

The table below is showing all possible scenarios and definitions
according to which the content of the transparent container shall be
encoded. Additionally the reference to the specification defining
particular IE is given.

########  Annex C (informative): Processing of Transparent Containers at the MME

The encoding of the *Source to Target Transparent Container* and *Target
to Source Transparent Container* IEs in this specification is different
from the one specified in TS 25.413 \[19\].

Irrespective of the mobility scenario (inter-RAT or intra-LTE), the MME
always processes these IEs in the following way:

\- The MME shall convey to the eNodeB the information received within

\- the GTPv1-C \"UTRAN transparent field\" of the \"UTRAN Transparent
Container\" IE across the Gn-interface (see subclause 7.7.38 of TS
29.060 \[35\]), or

\- the GTPv1-C \"BSS Container\" (value part octets 4-n) of the \"BSS
Container\" IE across the Gn- interface (see subclause 7.7.72 of TS
29.060 \[35\]), or

\- the GTPv2 \"F-container field\" of the \"F-Container\" IE across the
S3/S10- interface (see subclause 8.48 of TS 29.274 \[36\]).

by including it in the octets of the OCTET STRING of the *Source to
Target Transparent Container* IE, the *Target to Source Transparent
Container* IE or the *Target to Source Transparent Container Secondary*
IE of the corresponding S1AP message.

\- The MME shall convey to the GTP peer the information received within
the octets of the OCTET STRING of the *Source to Target Transparent
Container* IE, the *Target to Source Transparent Container* IE or the
*Target to Source Transparent Container Secondary* IE by including it in

\- the GTPv1-C \"UTRAN transparent field\" of the \"UTRAN Transparent
Container\" IE across the Gn- interface (see subclause 7.7.38 of TS
29.060 \[35\]), or

\- the GTPv1-C \"BSS Container\" (value part octets 4-n) of the \"BSS
Container\" IE across the Gn- interface (see subclause 7.7.72 of TS
29.060 \[35\]), or

\- the GTPv2 \"F-container field\" of the \"F-Container\" IE across the
S3/S10- interface (see subclause 8.48 of TS 29.274 \[36\]).
