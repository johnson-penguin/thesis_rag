6 Functions of the serving MSC
==============================

The functions of the serving MSC are specified in TS 23.018. The
procedures specific to the CD supplementary service are specified in
this subclause.

6.1 Procedure Handling\_CD\_MSC
-------------------------------

This procedure is called when a CD request is received from the MS.

6.2 Procedure CD\_Reject
------------------------

This procedure is called if the CD request was treated unsuccessful in
the VLR.

6.3 Procedure CD\_Failure
-------------------------

This procedure is called if the CD request was treated unsuccessful in
the serving MSC.

6.4 Procedure CD\_UUS\_Interaction
----------------------------------

This procedure is called if the CD request was treated unsuccessful in
the serving MSC due to the interaction with the UUS supplementary
service.

6.5 Procedure CD\_Success
-------------------------

This procedure is called if the CD request was treated successful in the
serving MSC.

6.6 Procedure CD\_Notify\_SS\_Invocation
----------------------------------------

This procedure is called by the procedures CD\_OR\_Clear and CD\_Success
to send notification of the CD invocation to the gsmSCF if required.

The output signal SS Invocation Notify is sent if the SS-CSI was
received in the SIFIC ack. The SS-CSI will only be included in the SIFIC
ack if there is a requirement to notify the gsmSCF that CD has been
invoked.

7 Functions of the serving VLR
==============================

The functions of the serving VLR are specified in TS 23.018. The
procedure specific to the CD supplementary service is specified in this
subclause.

7.1 Procedure CD\_Authorization
-------------------------------

This procedure examines the authorization related to Call Deflection.

The procedure CAMEL\_Check\_CD\_Interaction is specific to CAMEL phase
2. If CAMEL phase 2 is not supported in the VLR, processing continues
from the \"No\" exit of the test \"Result=Pass?\".

The procedure CAMEL\_CHECK\_SII2\_CDTI is specific to CAMEL Phase 3 or
higher. If CAMEL Phase 3 or higher is not supported in the VLR,
processing continues from the \"Yes\" exit of the test \"Result =
Pass?\".

7.2 Procedure CAMEL\_Check\_CD\_Interaction
-------------------------------------------

This procedure examines whether a Translation Interaction Flag (TIF-CSI)
is provided for the served subscriber.

Figure 7.2: Procedure CAMEL\_Check\_CD\_Interaction

8 Interaction with other supplementary services
===============================================

8.1 Line Identification services
--------------------------------

If the serving MSC receives an Answer message from the destination C
network after the successful invocation of the call deflection
supplementary service, the process MAF039 of TS 23.081 shall be
performed. Refer to Process ICH\_MSC of TS 23.018 for further details.

8.2 Call Forwarding services
----------------------------

No impact.

8.3 Call Waiting
----------------

The MS may send a CD Request message for an incoming waiting call. Refer
to procedure Process\_Call\_Waiting\_MSC of TS 23.018 for further
details.

8.4 Call Hold
-------------

No impact.

8.5 Multi Party (MPTY)
----------------------

No impact.

8.6 Closed User Group
---------------------

The serving VLR shall perform the forwarding CUG authorisation as
defined in TS 23.085 while processing a call deflection request. Refer
to Process ICH\_VLR of TS 23.018 for details.

8.7 Advice of Charge (AoC)
--------------------------

No impact.

8.8 Call Barring Services
-------------------------

If a call deflection request is processed, the serving VLR shall check
whether the requested deflected-to number contradicts active and
operative outgoing barring programs. Refer to Procedure
CD\_Authorization (figure 6.6) for details.

8.9 Explicit call transfer (ECT)
--------------------------------

If in the originating network ECT is invoked (one call answered, the
other alerting), the serving MSC shall map a redirection number
parameter received in the ECT notification into the calling identity
parameter of the outgoing IAM message. Refer to TS 23.091 (Interaction
of Call Forwarding on mobile subscriber busy due to UDUB and explicit
call transfer) for details.

8.10 Completion of Calls to Busy Subscriber (CCBS)
--------------------------------------------------

If a call is deflected to a NDUB destination, the serving MSC shall set
the diagnostic to \"CCBS not possible\" when it releases the call
towards the calling network. Refer to Process ICH\_MSC of TS 23.018 for
further details.

The serving MSC shall remove the CCBS call Indicator from the IAM
message when deflecting a call.

9 Interaction with other network features
=========================================

9.1 Customised Applications for Mobile network Enhanced Logic (CAMEL)
---------------------------------------------------------------------

If the served subscriber is provided with a Translation Information Flag
(TIF-CSI) as defined in TS 23.018 the VLR shall neither perform checks
regarding the validity of the deflected-to number nor perform
interactions with BOIC and BOIC-exHC barring programs. Refer to
Procedure CD\_Authorization for further details.

9.2 Support of Optimal Routeing
-------------------------------

The procedures for optimal routeing of late call forwarding shall apply
if the Call Deflection supplementary service is invoked. Refer to
TS 23.079 for further details.

10 Information stored in the HLR
================================

The following logical states are applicable for the Call Deflection
service (refer to TS 23.011 for an explanation of the notation):

**[Provisioning State]{.underline} [Registration State]{.underline}
[Activation State]{.underline} [HLR Induction State]{.underline}**

(Not Provisioned, Not Applicable, Not Active, Not Induced)

(Provisioned, Not Applicable, Active and Operative, Not Induced)

The HLR shall store:

\- the logical state of the Call Deflection service (which shall be one
of the valid states listed above) on a per subscriber basis.

\- the subscription option \"notification to the calling party\" on a
per subscriber basis;\
This subscription option takes one of the following values:\
- no notification;\
- notification.

\- the subscription option \"MSISDN of the served subscriber can be
presented to the forwarded-to subscriber\" on a per subscriber basis;\
This subscription option takes one of the following values:\
- presentation restricted;\
- presentation allowed.

11 State transition model
=========================

Figure 11.1 shows the successful cases of transition between the
applicable logical states of the Call Deflection service. The state
changes are caused by actions of the service provider.

Note that error cases are not shown in the diagram as they normally do
not cause a state change. Additionally, some successful requests may not
cause a state change and are therefore not shown in the diagram.

height="1.9354166666666666in"}

Figure 11.1: State transition model

12 Transfer of information from HLR to VLR
==========================================

If the provisioning state for the Call Deflection service is
\"Provisioned\" then when the subscriber registers on a VLR the HLR
shall send that VLR information about the logical state of the Call
Deflection service In this case the following additional information
shall be sent to the VLR:

\- subscription options \"notification to the calling party\" and
\"MSISDN of the served subscriber can be presented to the forwarded-to
subscriber\".

\- Translation Information Flag (TIF-CSI) if contained in the CAMEL
subscriber data of the served subscriber (refer to TS 23.078 for further
details).

If the logical state of the Call Deflection service or the value of the
subscription options \"notification to the calling party\" or \"MSISDN
of the served subscriber can be presented to the forwarded-to
subscriber\" or the presence of the Translation Information Flag
(TIF-CSI) is changed while a subscriber is registered on a VLR then the
HLR shall inform the VLR of the new logical state or the new value of
the subscription option or the presence of the Translation Information
Flag (TIF-CSI).

13 Information stored in the VLR
================================

For the supplementary service Call Deflection the VLR shall store the
service state information, information about the subscription options
\"notification to the calling party\" and \"MSISDN of the served
subscriber can be presented to the forwarded-to subscriber\" and the
Translation Information Flag (TIF-CSI) received from the HLR.

14 Handover
===========

Handover will have no impact on the control procedures and the operation
of the service.
