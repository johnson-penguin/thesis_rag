present document are listed in 3GPP TR 21.905 \[1a\].

4 Requirement
=============

Dual Tone Multi Frequency (DTMF) is an inband one out of four plus one
out of four signalling system, primarily used from terminal instruments
in telecommunication networks. The international recommendations which
apply are ETSI ES 201 235 \[3, 4, 5\] as detailed in subclauses 6.2 and
6.3. For PCS 1900 for North America the Standards which apply are
operator specific.

In the 3GPP system the MSC must support DTMF in the mobile to land
direction.

The support of this facility in the land to mobile direction is for
further study.

The use of DTMF is only permitted:

\- when the speech teleservice is being used or during the speech phase
of alternate speech/data and alternate speech/facsimile teleservices;
the DTMF is transmitted across the radio interface as specified in
subclause 6 of this specification; and

\- during a multimedia call; the DTMF is transmitted across the radio
interface using the H.245 UserInputIndication message (see
ITU-T H.245 \[6\]). This is transparent for the MSC.

The responsibility for checking this lies in the MS.

5 Cause of DTMF generation
==========================

A user may cause a DTMF tone to be generated by depression of a key in
the Mobile Station (MS). Optionally (on a MS basis) manufacturers of
mobile equipment may choose to allow DTMF to be controlled from a remote
terminal.

The man-machine interface questions associated with this facility are
not discussed further in the present document.

6 Support of DTMF across the air interface
==========================================

6.1 General
-----------

A message based signalling system is used across the 3GPP system air
interface.

This requires that the relevant user action (e.g. a key depression) is
interpreted by the MS as a requirement for a DTMF digit to be sent, this
is converted by the MS into a message, the message is transmitted across
the air interface, and is converted by the MSC into a DTMF tone which is
applied towards the network, which should then respond with an
acknowledgement. When the user completes the key depression, an message
that the DTMF sending should cease is also passed to the MSC, which
again will respond with an acknowledgement.

6.2 Specific
------------

The messages to be sent across the air interface will use the frame
stealing mode of transmission.

The messages when sent across the air interface should contain the
following information:

a\) START DTMF: Containing the digit value (0-9,A,B,C,D,\*,\#);

b\) START DTMF ACKNOWLEDGE: Containing the digit value
(0-9,A,B,C,D,\*,\#) corresponding to the DTMF tone that the network
applies towards the remote user;

c\) STOP DTMF: No further info;

d\) STOP DTMF ACKNOWLEDGE: No further info.

Only a single digit will be passed in each START DTMF and START DTMF
ACKNOWLEDGE message.

The messages will be passed transparently through the base station and
interpreted at the MSC.

On receipt of a START DTMF message, the MSC will connect the correct
dual-tone to line. This tone will remain connected until either the call
is cleared or a STOP DTMF message is received.

As an operator option, the tone may be ceased after a pre-determined
time whether or not a STOP DTMF message has been received.

The tones that are to be generated by the MSC are specified as follows:

\- Frequencies are defined in ETSI ES 201 235-1 \[3\] (for PCS 1900 for
North America this is operator specific);

\- Tone sending levels are defined in ETSI ES 201 235-2 \[4\] (for
PCS 1900 for North America this is operator specific);

\- Durations as specified below.

6.3 Tone durations
------------------

The network shall ensure that the minimum length of tone and the minimum
gap between two subsequent tones according to ETSI ES 201 235-2 \[4\] is
achieved. For PCS 1900 for North America this is operator specific.

NOTE 1: In ETSI ES 201 235-2 \[4\] the minimum duration of a DTMF tone
is 65 ms.

NOTE 2: In ETSI ES 201 235-2 \[4\] the minimum gap between DTMF tones is
65 ms.

There is no defined maximum length to the tone, which will normally
cease when a STOP DTMF message is received from the MS. However, the
operator may choose to put a pre-defined time limit on the duration of
tones sent to line as mentioned in clause 6.2.

Figures 1 to 3 show an overview of how the DTMF should operate.

NOTE: If the Network operator implements the time limit option (see
subclause 6.2), then the tone ends if the timer expires before the
\'Stop DTMF\' is received.

7 Effect of Handover
====================

7.1 Internal Handover
---------------------

There is unlikely to be any impact on DTMF due to internal handover.

7.2 External Handover
---------------------

Depending on the exact moment when handover occurs, there may be a
slight possibility of cutting short a DTMF tone.

For protocol reasons, in the case of an MSC receiving a STOP DTMF
message when no tone is being sent, it should respond with an
acknowledgement as usual.

No other impact is seen due to external handover.
