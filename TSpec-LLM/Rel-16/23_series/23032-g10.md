Foreword
========

This Technical Specification (TS) has been produced by the 3rd
Generation Partnership Project (3GPP).

The present document defines an intermediate universal Geographical Area
Description within the 3GPP system.

The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work
within the TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the
TSG modify the contents of the present document, it will be re-released
by the TSG with an identifying change of release date and an increase in
version number as follows:

Version x.y.z

where:

x the first digit:

1 presented to TSG for information;

2 presented to TSG for approval;

3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.

y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e.
technical enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.

z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been
incorporated in the document.

1 Scope
=======

The present document defines an intermediate universal Geographical Area
Description which subscriber applications, GSM or UMTS services can use
and the network can convert into an equivalent radio coverage map.

For GSM or UMTS services which involve the use of an \"area\", it can be
assumed that in the majority of cases the Service Requester will be
forbidden access to data on the radio coverage map of a particular PLMN
and that the Service Requester will not have direct access to network
entities (e.g. BSC/BTS or RNC/Node B).

The interpretation by the PLMN operator of the geographical area in
terms of cells actually used, cells that are partly within the given
area and all other technical and quality of service aspects are out of
the scope of the present document.

This specification also provides a description of velocity that may be
associated with a universal Geographical Area Description when both are
applied to a common entity at a common time.

3.1 Definitions
---------------

For the purposes of the present document, the following definitions
apply.

Description in any protocol to inform the network about a defined area.

**Target: E**ntity whose precise geographic position is to be described.

3.2 Abbreviations

For the purposes of the present document, the abbreviations given in
GSM 01.04 \[1\] and the following apply.

GAD Geographical Area Description

GPS Global Positioning System

WGS World Geodetic System

4 Reference system
==================

The reference system chosen for the coding of locations is the World
Geodetic System 1984, (WGS 84), which is also used by the Global
Positioning System, (GPS). The origin of the WGS 84 co-ordinate system
is the geometric centre of the WGS 84 ellipsoid. The ellipsoid is
constructed by the rotation of an ellipse around the minor axis which is
oriented in the North-South direction. The rotation axis is the polar
axis of the ellipsoid, and the plane orthogonal to it and including the
centre of symmetry is the equatorial plane.

The relevant dimensions are as follows:

Major Axis (a) = 6378137 m

Minor Axis (b) = 6356752,314 m

First eccentricity of the ellipsoid
$= \ \frac{a^{2} - b^{2}}{b^{2}}\  = \ 0,\text{0066943800668}$

Co-ordinates are then expressed in terms of longitude and latitude
relevant to this ellipsoid. The range of longitude is ‑180° to +180°,
and the range of latitude is -90° to +90°. 0° longitude corresponds to
the Greenwich Meridian, and positive angles are to the East, while
negative angles are to the West. 0° latitude corresponds to the equator,
and positive angles are to the North, while negative angles are to the
South. Altitudes are defined as the distance between the ellipsoid and
the point, along a line orthogonal to the ellipsoid.

5 Shapes
========

The intention is to incorporate a number of different shapes, that can
be chosen according to need.

\- Ellipsoid Point;

\- Ellipsoid point with uncertainty circle;

\- Ellipsoid point with uncertainty ellipse;

\- Polygon;

\- Ellipsoid point with altitude;

\- Ellipsoid point with altitude and uncertainty ellipsoid;

\- Ellipsoid Arc;

\- High Accuracy Ellipsoid point with uncertainty ellipse;

\- High Accuracy Ellipsoid point with scalable uncertainty ellipse;

\- High Accuracy Ellipsoid point with altitude and uncertainty
ellipsoid;

\- High Accuracy Ellipsoid point with altitude and scalable uncertainty
ellipsoid.

Each shape is discussed individually.

5.1 Ellipsoid Point
-------------------

The description of an ellipsoid point is that of a point on the surface
of the ellipsoid, and consists of a latitude and a longitude. In
practice, such a description can be used to refer to a point on Earth\'s
surface, or close to Earth\'s surface, with the same longitude and
latitude. No provision is made in this version of the standard to give
the height of a point.

Figure 1 illustrates a point on the surface of the ellipsoid and its
co-ordinates.

The latitude is the angle between the equatorial plane and the
perpendicular to the plane tangent to the ellipsoid surface at the
point. Positive latitudes correspond to the North hemisphere. The
longitude is the angle between the half-plane determined by the
Greenwich meridian and the half-plane defined by the point and the polar
axis, measured Eastward.

Figure 1: Description of a Point as two co-ordinates

5.2 Ellipsoid point with uncertainty circle
-------------------------------------------

The \"ellipsoid point with uncertainty circle\" is characterised by the
co-ordinates of an ellipsoid point (the origin) and a distance *r*. It
describes formally the set of points on the ellipsoid which are at a
distance from the origin less than or equal to *r*, the distance being
the geodesic distance over the ellipsoid, i.e., the minimum length of a
path staying on the ellipsoid and joining the two points, as shown in
figure 2.

As for the ellipsoid point, this can be used to indicate points on the
Earth surface, or near the Earth surface, of same latitude and
longitude.

The typical use of this shape is to indicate a point when its position
is known only with a limited accuracy.

Figure 2: Description of an uncertainty Circle

5.3 Ellipsoid point with uncertainty ellipse
--------------------------------------------

The \"ellipsoid point with uncertainty ellipse\" is characterised by the
co-ordinates of an ellipsoid point (the origin), distances *r1* and *r2*
and an angle of orientation *A*. It describes formally the set of points
on the ellipsoid which fall within or on the boundary of an ellipse with
semi-major axis of length *r1* oriented at angle *A* (0 to 180^o^)
measured clockwise from north and semi-minor axis of length *r2*, the
distances being the geodesic distance over the ellipsoid, i.e., the
minimum length of a path staying on the ellipsoid and joining the two
points, as shown in figure 2a.

As for the ellipsoid point, this can be used to indicate points on the
Earth\'s surface, or near the Earth\'s surface, of same latitude and
longitude. The confidence level with which the position of a target
entity is included within this set of points is also included with this
shape.

The typical use of this shape is to indicate a point when its position
is known only with a limited accuracy, but the geometrical contributions
to uncertainty can be quantified.

> Figure 2a: Description of an uncertainty Ellipse

5.3a High Accuracy Ellipsoid point with uncertainty ellipse
-----------------------------------------------------------

The \"high accuracy ellipsoid point with uncertainty ellipse\" is
characterised by the co-ordinates of an ellipsoid point (the origin),
distances *r1* and *r2* and an angle of orientation A, as described in
clause 5.3. Compared to the \"ellipsoid point with uncertainty
ellipse\", the \"high accuracy ellipsoid point with uncertainty
ellipse\" provides finer resolution for the co-ordinates, and distances
*r1* and *r2*.

5.3b High Accuracy Ellipsoid point with scalable uncertainty ellipse
--------------------------------------------------------------------

The \"high accuracy ellipsoid point with scalable uncertainty ellipse\"
is characterised by the co-ordinates of an ellipsoid point (the origin),
distances *r1* and *r2* and an angle of orientation A, as described in
clause 5.3. Compared to the \"ellipsoid point with uncertainty
ellipse\", the \"high accuracy ellipsoid point with scalable uncertainty
ellipse\" provides finer resolution for the co-ordinates, and distances
*r1* and *r2*, and additionally provides possibility to choose
uncertainty range compared to \"high accuracy ellipsoid point with
uncertainty ellipse\".

5.4 Polygon
-----------

A polygon is an arbitrary shape described by an ordered series of points
(in the example pictured in the drawing, A to E). The minimum number of
points allowed is 3, and the maximum number of points allowed is 15. The
points shall be connected in the order that they are given. A connecting
line is defined as the line over the ellipsoid joining the two points
and of minimum distance (geodesic). The last point is connected to the
first. The list of points shall respect a number of conditions:

\- a connecting line shall not cross another connecting line;

\- two successive points must not be diametrically opposed on the
ellipsoid.

The described area is situated to the right of the lines with the
downward direction being toward the Earth\'s centre and the forward
direction being from a point to the next.

NOTE: This definition does not permit connecting lines greater than
roughly 20 000 km. If such a need arises, the polygon can be described
by adding an intermediate point.

Computation of geodesic lines is not simple. Approximations leading to a
maximum distance between the computed line and the geodesic line of less
than 3 metres are acceptable.

5.5 Ellipsoid Point with Altitude
---------------------------------

The description of an ellipsoid point with altitude is that of a point
at a specified distance above or below a point on the earth\'s surface.
This is defined by an ellipsoid point with the given longitude and
latitude and the altitude above or below the ellipsoid point. Figure 3a
illustrates the altitude aspect of this description.

> Figure 3a: Description of an Ellipsoid Point with Altitude

5.6 Ellipsoid point with altitude and uncertainty ellipsoid
-----------------------------------------------------------

The \"ellipsoid point with altitude and uncertainty ellipsoid\" is
characterised by the co-ordinates of an ellipsoid point with altitude,
distances *r1* (the \"semi-major uncertainty\"), *r2* (the \"semi-minor
uncertainty\") and *r3* (the \"vertical uncertainty\") and an angle of
orientation *A* (the \"angle of the major axis\")*.* It describes
formally the set of points which fall within or on the surface of a
general (three dimensional) ellipsoid centred on an ellipsoid point with
altitude whose real semi-major, semi-mean and semi-minor axis are some
permutation of *r1*, *r2*, *r3* with *r1* ≥ *r2*. The *r3* axis is
aligned vertically, while the *r1* axis, which is the semi-major axis of
the ellipse in a horizontal plane that bisects the ellipsoid, is
oriented at an angle *A* (0 to 180 degrees) measured clockwise from
north, as illustrated in Figure 3b.

> Figure 3b: Description of an Ellipsoid Point with Altitude and
> Uncertainty Ellipsoid

The typical use of this shape is to indicate a point when its horizontal
position and altitude are known only with a limited accuracy, but the
geometrical contributions to uncertainty can be quantified. The
confidence level with which the position of a target entity is included
within the shape is also included.

5.6a High Accuracy Ellipsoid point with altitude and uncertainty ellipsoid
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

The \"high accuracy ellipsoid point with altitude and uncertainty
ellipsoid\" is characterised by the co-ordinates of an ellipsoid point
with altitude, distances *r1* (the \"semi-major uncertainty\"), *r2*
(the \"semi-minor uncertainty\") and *r3* (the \"vertical uncertainty\")
and an angle of orientation A (the \"angle of the major axis\"), as
described in clause 5.6. Compared to the \"ellipsoid point with altitude
and uncertainty ellipsoid\", the \"high accuracy ellipsoid point with
altitude and uncertainty ellipsoid\" provides finer resolution for the
co-ordinates, and distances *r1*, *r2*, and *r3*.

5.6b High Accuracy Ellipsoid point with altitude and scalable uncertainty ellipsoid
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The \"high accuracy ellipsoid point with altitude and scalable
uncertainty ellipsoid\" is characterised by the co-ordinates of an
ellipsoid point with altitude, distances r1 (the \"semi-major
uncertainty\"), *r2* (the \"semi-minor uncertainty\") and *r3* (the
\"vertical uncertainty\") and an angle of orientation A (the \"angle of
the major axis\"), as described in clause 5.6. Compared to the
\"ellipsoid point with altitude and uncertainty ellipsoid\", the \"high
accuracy ellipsoid point with altitude and scalable uncertainty
ellipsoid\" provides finer resolution for the co-ordinates, and
distances *r1*, *r2*, and *r3*, and additionally provides possibility to
choose uncertainty range compared to \"high accuracy ellipsoid point
with altitude and uncertainty ellipse\".

5.7 Ellipsoid Arc
-----------------

An ellipsoid arc is a shape characterised by the co-ordinates of an
ellipsoid point *o* (the origin), inner radius *r1,* uncertainty radius
*r2*, both radii being geodesic distances over the surface of the
ellipsoid, the offset angle (θ) between the first defining radius of the
ellipsoid arc and North, and the included angle (β) being the angle
between the first and second defining radii. The offset angle is within
the range of 0° to 359,999...° while the included angle is within the
range from 0,000...1° to 360°. This is to be able to describe a full
circle, 0° to 360°.

This shape-definition can also be used to describe a sector (inner
radius equal to zero), a circle (included angle equal to 360°) and other
circular shaped areas. The confidence level with which the position of a
target entity is included within the shape is also included.

6 Coding
========

6.1 Point
---------

The co-ordinates of an ellipsoid point are coded with an uncertainty of
less than 3 metres.

The latitude is coded with 24 bits: 1 bit of sign and a number between 0
and 2^23^-1 coded in binary on 23 bits. The relation between the coded
number *N* and the range of (absolute) latitudes *X* it encodes is the
following (*X* in degrees):

$N \leq \frac{2^{\text{23}}}{\text{90}}X < N + 1$

except for *N*=2^23^-1, for which the range is extended to include
*N*+1.

The longitude, expressed in the range -180°, +180°, is coded as a number
between -2^23^ and 2^23^-1, coded in 2\'s complement binary on 24 bits.
The relation between the coded number *N* and the range of longitude *X*
it encodes is the following (*X* in degrees):

$N \leq \frac{2^{\text{24}}}{\text{360}}X < N + 1$

6.1a High Accuracy Point
------------------------

The co-ordinates of a high accuracy ellipsoid point are coded with a
resolution of less than 5 millimetre for latitude, and less than 10
millimetre for longitude.

The latitude for a high accuracy point, expressed in the range -90°,
+90°, is coded as a number between -2^31^ and 2^31^-1, coded in 2\'s
complement binary on 32 bits. The relation between the latitude *X* in
the range \[-90°, 90°\] and the coded number *N* is:

$N = \left\lfloor \frac{X}{\text{90}^{\circ}}2^{\text{31}} \right\rfloor$

where $\left\lfloor x \right\rfloor$ denotes the greatest integer less
than or equal to *x* (floor operator).

The longitude for a high accuracy point, expressed in the range -180°,
+180°, is coded as a number between -2^31^ and 2^31^-1, coded in 2\'s
complement binary on 32 bits. The relation between the longitude *X* in
the range \[-180°, 180°) and the coded number *N* is:

$N = \left\lfloor \frac{X}{\text{180}^{\circ}}2^{\text{31}} \right\rfloor$

6.2 Uncertainty
---------------

A method of describing the uncertainty for latitude and longitude has
been sought which is both flexible (can cover wide differences in range)
and efficient. The proposed solution makes use of a variation on the
Binomial expansion. The uncertainty *r*, expressed in metres, is mapped
to a number *K*, with the following formula:

$r = C\left( \left( 1 + x \right)^{K} - 1 \right)$

with *C* = 10 and *x* = 0,1. With 0 ≤ *K* ≤ 127, a suitably useful range
between 0 and 1800 kilometres is achieved for the uncertainty, while
still being able to code down to values as small as 1 metre. The
uncertainty can then be coded on 7 bits, as the binary encoding of *K*.

6.2a High Accuracy Uncertainty
------------------------------

The high accuracy uncertainty r, expressed in metres, is mapped to a
number *K*, with the following formula:

$r = C\left( \left( 1 + x \right)^{K} - 1 \right)$

with *C* = 0.3 and *x* = 0.02. With 0 ≤ *K* ≤ 255, a suitably useful
range between 0 and 46.49129 metres is achieved for the high accuracy
uncertainty, while still being able to code down to values as small as 6
millimetre. The uncertainty can then be coded on 8 bits, as the binary
encoding of *K*.

  -------------- ----------------------

6.2b High Accuracy Extended Uncertainty
---------------------------------------

The high accuracy extended uncertainty *r*, expressed in metres, is
mapped to a number *K*, with the following formula:

$r = C\left( \left( 1 + x \right)^{K} - 1 \right)$

with C = 0.3 and x = 0.02594, with 0 \* *K* \* 253, and *r* = 200 m with
*K*=254, and *r* \> 200 m with *K*=255 a suitably useful range between 0
and 200 metres is achieved for the high accuracy uncertainty, while
still being able to code down to values as small as 8 millimetres. The
uncertainty can then be coded on 8 bits, as the binary encoding of *K*.

  254            200 m
  255            \> 200 m
  -------------- ----------------------

6.3 Altitude
------------

Altitude is encoded in increments of 1 meter using a 15 bit binary coded
number *N*. The relation between the number *N* and the range of
altitudes *a* (in metres) it encodes is described by the following
equation:

$N \leq a < N + 1$

> except for *N*=2^15^-1 for which the range is extended to include all
> greater values of *a.*

The direction of altitude is encoded by a single bit with bit value 0
representing height above the WGS84 ellipsoid surface and bit value 1
representing depth below the WGS84 ellipsoid surface.

6.3a High Accuracy Altitude
---------------------------

High accuracy altitude is encoded as a number *N* between -64000 and
1280000 using 2\'s complement binary on 22 bits. The relation between
the number N and the altitude a (in metres) it encodes is described by
the following equation:

$a = N \times 2^{- 7}$

So, the altitude for a high accuracy point, with a scale factor of
2^-7^, ranges between -500 metres and 10000 metres. The altitude is
encoded representing height above (plus) or below (minus) the WGS84
ellipsoid surface.

6.4 Uncertainty Altitude
------------------------

The uncertainty in altitude, *h*, expressed in metres is mapped from the
binary number *K*, with the following formula:

![](media/image9.png){width="1.3423611111111111in"
height="0.19791666666666666in"}

with *C* = 45 and *x* = 0,025. With 0 ≤ *K* ≤ 127, a suitably useful
range between 0 and 990 meters is achieved for the uncertainty altitude.
The uncertainty can then be coded on 7 bits, as the binary encoding of
*K*.

Table 2: Example values for the uncertainty altitude Function

  -------------- -------------------------------
  Value of *K*   Value of uncertainty altitude
  0              0 m

  20             28,7 m

  \-             \-
  127            990,5 m
  -------------- -------------------------------

6.5 Confidence
--------------

The confidence by which the position of a target entity is known to be
within the shape description, (expressed as a percentage) is directly
mapped from the 7 bit binary number *K*, except for *K*=0 which is used
to indicate \'no information\', and 100 \< *K* ≤128 which should not be
used but may be interpreted as \"no information\" if received.

6.6 Radius
----------

Inner radius is encoded in increments of 5 meters using a 16 bit binary
coded number *N*. The relation between the number *N* and the range of
radius *r* (in metres) it encodes is described by the following
equation:

$5N \leq r < 5(N + 1)$

> Except for *N*=2^16^-1 for which the range is extended to include all
> greater values of *r.* This provides a true maximum radius of 327,675
> meters.

The uncertainty radius is encoded as for the uncertainty latitude and
longitude.

6.7 Angle
---------

Offset and Included angle are encoded in increments of 2° using an 8 bit
binary coded number *N* in the range 0 to 179. The relation between the
number *N* and the range offset (*ao*) and included (*ai*) of angles (in
degrees) it encodes is described by the following equations:

Offset angle (*ao*)

2 *N* \<= *ao* \< 2 (*N*+1) Accepted values for *ao* are within the
range from 0 to 359,9\...9 degrees.

Included angle (*ai*)

2 *N* \< *ai* \<= 2 (*N*+1) Accepted values for *ai* are within the
range from 0,0\...1 to 360 degrees.

7 General message format and information elements coding
========================================================

This clause describes a coding method for geographical area
descriptions. A geographical area description is coded as a finite bit
string. In the figures, the bit string is described by octets from top
downward, and in the octet from left to right. Number encoding strings
start with the most significant bit.

7.1 Overview
------------

A bit string encoding a geographical description shall consist of the
following parts:

\- Type of Shape;

\- Shape Description.

Such a bit string is usually part of an information element. The
structure of the information element (e.g., element identifier, length)
depends on the protocol in which the message containing the description
is defined, and is specified in the protocol specification.

This organisation is illustrated in the example shown in figure 4.

Figure 4: Example

7.2 Type of Shape
-----------------

The Type of Shape information field identifies the type which is being
coded in the Shape Description. The Type of Shape is coded as shown in
table 2a.

8 Description of Velocity
=========================

A description of velocity is applicable to any target entity on or close
to the surface of the WGS84 ellipsoid.

8.1 Horizontal Velocity
-----------------------

Horizontal velocity is characterised by the horizontal speed and
bearing. The horizontal speed gives the magnitude of the horizontal
component of the velocity of a target entity. The bearing provides the
direction of the horizontal component of velocity taken clockwise from
North.

Figure 11: Description of Horizontal Velocity with Uncertainty

8.2 Horizontal and Vertical Velocity
------------------------------------

Horizontal and vertical velocity is characterised by horizontal speed,
bearing, vertical speed and direction. The horizontal speed and bearing
characterise the horizontal component of velocity. The vertical speed
and direction provides the component of velocity of a target entity in a
vertical direction.

8.3 Horizontal Velocity with Uncertainty
----------------------------------------

Horizontal velocity with uncertainty is characterised by a horizontal
speed and bearing, giving a horizontal velocity vector
*[V]{.underline}*, and an uncertainty speed s. It describes the set of
velocity vectors *[v]{.underline}* related to the given velocity
*[V]{.underline}* as follows:

\|*[v]{.underline}* -- *[V]{.underline}*\| ≤ s

Figure 12: Description of Horizontal Velocity with Uncertainty

8.4 Horizontal and Vertical Velocity with Uncertainty
-----------------------------------------------------

Horizontal and vertical velocity with uncertainty is characterised by a
horizontal speed and bearing, giving a horizontal velocity vector
*[V]{.underline}~x,y~*, a vertical speed and direction giving a vertical
velocity component *V~z,~*and uncertainty speeds s1 and s2. It describes
the set of velocity vectors *[v]{.underline}* with horizontal and
vertical components *[v]{.underline}~x,y~*, and *v~z~* that are related
to the given velocity components *[V]{.underline}~x,y~*, and *V~z~* as
follows:

\|*[v]{.underline}~x,y~*, [ ]{.underline} -- *[V]{.underline}~x,y~*, \|
≤ s1

\|*v~z\ ~*- *V~z~*\| ≤ s2

8.5 Coding Principles
---------------------

Velocity is encoded as shown in Figure 13. The velocity type in bits 8-5
of octet 1 defines the type of velocity information in succeeding bits.

Figure 13: General Coding of Velocity

8.6 Coding of Velocity Type
---------------------------

Table 3 shows the coding of the velocity type.

  0 0 1 1        Horizontal with Vertical Velocity and Uncertainty
  other values   reserved for future use
  -------------- ---------------------------------------------------

8.7 Coding of Horizontal Speed
------------------------------

Horizontal speed is encoded in increments of 1 kilometre per hour using
a 16 bit binary coded number N. The relation between the number N and
the horizontal speed *h* (in kilometres per hour) it encodes is
described by the following equations:

N ≤ h \< N + 0.5 (N = 0)

N -- 0.5 ≤ h \< N + 0.5 (0 \< N \< 2^16^-1)

N -- 0.5 ≤ h (N = 2^16^-1)

8.8 Coding of Bearing
---------------------

Bearing is encoded in increments of 1 degree measured clockwise from
North using a 9 bit binary coded number N. The relation between the
number N and the bearing b (in degrees) it encodes is described by the
following equation:

N ≤ b \< N+1

except for 360 ≤ N \< 511 which are not used.

8.9 Coding of Vertical Speed
----------------------------

Vertical speed is encoded in increments of 1 kilometre per hour using 8
bits giving a number N between 0 and 2^8^-1. The relation between the
number N and the vertical speed *v* (in kilometres per hour) it encodes
is described by the following equations:

N ≤ v \< N + 0.5 (N = 0)

N -- 0.5 ≤ v \< N + 0.5 (0 \< N \< 2^8^-1)

N -- 0.5 ≤ v (N = 2^8^-1)

8.10 Coding of Vertical Speed Direction
---------------------------------------

Vertical speed direction is encoded using 1 bit: a bit value of 0
indicates upward speed; a bit value of 1 indicates downward speed.

8.11 Coding of Uncertainty Speed
--------------------------------

Uncertainty speed is encoded in increments of 1 kilometre per hour using
an 8 bit binary coded number N. The value of N gives the uncertainty
speed except for N=255 which indicates that the uncertainty is not
specified.

8.12 Coding of Horizontal Velocity
