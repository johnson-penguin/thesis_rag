3 Definitions and abbreviations
===============================

3.1 Definitions
---------------

**Destination B:** The entity addressed in the original call set up,
which is busy when first called by subscriber A. Similarly, MSC B, VLR B
and HLR B are the network elements pertaining to Destination B when
Destination B is a GSM mobile.

**Originating queue:** The queue that manages CCBS requests for a
subscriber, when that subscriber is the originator of those CCBS
Requests.

**SSAP**: Supplementary Service Application Part. SSAP is the protocol
used for CCBS procedures on the interface between the originating and
destination network. Communication across this interface is performed
using SCCP Connectionless Signalling (Refer to ETS 300 358).

**Subscriber A:** The user of MS A, requesting CCBS. Similarly, MSC A,
VLR A and HLR A are the network elements pertaining to Subscriber A.

**Subscriber B:** The user of destination B, who may not necessarily
subscribe to CCBS.

**Subscriber C:** The user of MS C, who is the forwarded-to-party when
call forwarding applies. Similarly, MSC C, VLR C and HLR C are the
network elements pertaining to Subscriber C.

**Target queue:** The queue that manages CCBS requests for a subscriber,
when that subscriber is the target of CCBS Requests.

**Timers:** For each of the service timers, the location, start and stop
conditions and action on expiry are given - Refer to subclause 5.1.

3.2 Abbreviations
-----------------

Abbreviations used in this specification are listed in 3GPP TR 21.905.

4 General
=========

4.1 Overview
------------

The CCBS service allows a calling subscriber A, encountering a NDUB
destination B, to be notified when destination B becomes idle and to
have the network automatically generate a CCBS call to destination B, if
subscriber A desires. Subscriber A may make distinct CCBS requests for
calls to the same destination B for different basic services.

4.2 Architecture
----------------

Figure 4.2.1 is an architectural overview of the CCBS service when
interworking between the originating and the destination networks
involved. The originating network may be a mobile network or a fixed
network and the destination network may also be a mobile network or a
fixed network.

The call related signalling for CCBS is performed on ISUP links on the
following interfaces:

VMSC A - GMSC B;

VMSC A - DLE;

OLE - GMSC B;

whereas the specific CCBS procedures are performed via the SSAP
protocol, which is signalled on the following interfaces:

HLR A - HLR B;

HLR A - DLE;

OLE - HLR B.

Figure 4.2.1: Architectural overview showing common point of
interworking

### 4.2.1 Architectural overview during roaming

Either the originating subscriber A or the destination subscriber B or
both may be located outside of their HPLMNs during the CCBS service.
When all the involved networks support CCBS service the normal handling
described in this specification applies. When some network entities do
not support CCBS service refer to clause 10 where the exceptions are
described in more detail.

The signalling between different networks described in the subclause 4.2
applies also during roaming. HLR A and HLR B belongs always to the HPLMN
of the subscriber whereas VLR A and MSC A and GMSC, VLR B and MSC B
respectively may belong to a HPLMN or VPLMN. Refer to TS 23.018 where
call handling in the mobile network is described in more detail.

5 Handling of completion of calls to busy subscriber
====================================================

Registration and erasure of CCBS are not applicable. Activation and
Invocation of CCBS are intrinsic parts of the operation of the service,
and are described in this section.

5.1 CCBS Timers
---------------

The timers used to control the operation of CCBS can be considered to
consist of two groups i.e. the timers which operate on a per subscriber
basis (see table 1) and the service duration timers (T3 and T7) which
operate on a per CCBS Request basis (see table 2).

5.2 Information flows
---------------------

Figures 5.2.1 and 5.2.2 show the flow of information between network
elements for a mobile to mobile call for the following:

Figure 5.2.1: Successful CCBS request, destination B busy when request
made, subscriber A free when destination B becomes free.

Figure 5.2.2: Subscriber A is not idle when destination B becomes free.

Figures 5.2.3 and 5.2.4 show the flow of information between network
elements for a mobile to fixed call for the same situations described in
figures 5.2.1 and 5.2.2 respectively.

Each information flow diagram has been divided where appropriate into
four distinct phases of operation. These are as follows:

\(1\) Pre-conditions (Initial Call encountering NDUB and CCBS possible
in the destination network). The detailed description of the basic call
handling can be found in TS 23.018;

\(2\) Activation;

\(3\) Invocation;

\(4\) Operation (CCBS Call Set-up).

5.3 Activation
--------------

Activation of a CCBS Request is carried out by subscriber A. VLR A is
considered to be transparent during the activation operation.

The information flows shown in figures 5.2.1 to 5.2.4 inclusive show the
information flow for the activation process.

5.4 Deactivation
----------------

Subscriber A may deactivate CCBS in any of the following ways:

\- Deactivate all outstanding CCBS requests; or

\- Deactivate a specific CCBS Request.

The different deactivation operations are identified by different MMI
commands as specified in TS 22.030.

Deactivation of CCBS requests by subscriber A shall be performed at
HLR A.

To deactivate all outstanding CCBS requests, the Deactivate CCBS
operation request shall contain the SS-Code only.

To deactivate a specific CCBS request, the Deactivate CCBS operation
request shall contain the following parameters:

\- SS-Code;

\- CCBS Index.

On receipt of the deactivation request, HLR A shall cancel the CCBS
request, i.e. remove all record of a CCBS request from the subscriber
A\'s originating CCBS queue and instruct the destination B network to
cancel the corresponding CCBS request in the destination CCBS queue of
subscriber B. HLR A shall return a result indicating whether the
deactivation attempt was successful or not.

Figure 5.4.1: Successful deactivation of all CCBS Requests/a specific
CCBS request

NOTE: CCBS Cancel shall be sent for each CCBS Request that is cancelled
in HLR A.

NOTE: In the case where a subscriber attempts to perform a deactivation
operation but the subscriber is not provisioned with the CCBS service
then, the subscriber shall receive an indication that the CCBS service
is not provisioned for him.

5.5 Interrogation
-----------------

Interrogation of CCBS shall be carried by request to HLR A. HLR A then
returns the required information or error to MS A, see figure 5.5.1.
MSC A and VLR A are considered to be transparent during the
interrogation operation.

Figure 5.5.1: General interrogation of completion of calls to busy
subscriber

The Interrogate CCBS operation request shall contain the SS-Code only.

In response to a general interrogation, MS A shall be given the
AddressOfB, BasicServiceCode and CCBS index for each CCBS Request in the
queue. The entries shall be ordered in the chronological order, the
oldest entry shall be presented first.

If there are no CCBS Requests in the queue, MS A shall be given an
indication that no entries exist in the queue.

NOTE: In the case where a subscriber attempts to perform an
interrogation operation but the subscriber is not provisioned with the
CCBS service then, the subscriber shall receive an indication that the
CCBS service is not provisioned for him.

5.6 Messages and their contents
-------------------------------

This clause contains the detailed description of the information flows
used by CCBS.

Each Information Element, IE is marked as (M) Mandatory, (C) Conditional
or (O) Optional. A mandatory information element shall always be
present. A conditional information shall be present if certain
conditions are fulfilled; if those conditions are not fulfilled it shall
be absent. An optional information element may be present or absent, at
the discretion of the application at the sending entity. This
categorisation is a functional classification, i.e., stage 2 information
and not a stage 3 classifications to be used for the protocol.

The stage 2 and stage 3 message and information element names are not
necessarily identical.

### 5.6.1 Information elements used in the messages

#### 5.6.1.1 Call Information information element

Call Information information element is formed in the MSC A during the
CCBS activation. This information element contains unmodified copy of
the SETUP message received from the MS A. If CCBS Request is activated,
the Call Information is stored in the HLR A. During CCBS Recall Call
Information is relayed back to the MS. Refer to SETUP Container
information element defined in TS 24.008.

#### 5.6.1.2 AddressOfB information element 

AddressOfB information element is formed in the MSC A during the CCBS
activation. It contains the number of the destination B dialled by the

### 6.1.1 Overview

Monitoring is the process where the subscriber state is observed and
reported. When monitoring is started, the current subscriber state is
reported and any subsequent changes of subscriber state are reported
until monitoring is stopped.

Monitoring subscriber state information will be necessary against MS B
and may also be necessary against MS A.

For both these cases the monitoring functionality is located in the
appropriate serving VMSC/VLR and is controlled from the appropriate HLR.
The actions on the A-side and B-side for monitoring are completely
independent and the following description is generic to cover either
case. The HLR sends an explicit Start Reporting signal to the VLR to
initiate monitoring. The VLR acknowledges the request confirming that
monitoring has started and indicates the current status of the
subscriber state in the VMSC/VLR. The VLR will continue to send an Event
Report to the HLR whenever the appropriate subscriber state transition
event occurs. The HLR sends an explicit Stop Reporting signal to the VLR
when reporting on the subscriber state transitions is no longer
required.

### 6.1.2 Monitoring Subscriber B-state information

The CCBS service requires monitoring of the subscriber state at the
called destination network (B-side). This monitoring enables the HLR B
to be aware of any transition of subscriber state in VMSC/VLR B while
there is an active CCBS Request in the HLR B queue. The basic service
operation is that, when the destination B subscriber state becomes Idle,
the HLR B is informed and a Remote User Free indication is sent towards
the originating A network at the appropriate time. If subsequently to
that event the destination B subscriber state becomes not Idle or not
reachable, then the HLR B is informed by the VMSC/VLR B in order that it
can take an appropriate action towards HLR A, e.g. defer sending of the
Remote User Free indication.

### 6.1.3 Monitoring Subscriber A state information:

Monitoring Subscriber A state information will be necessary if the
Remote User Free indication from Destination B network cannot be acted
upon because e.g. MS A is not idle or not reachable and leads to the
CCBS request being suspended. The service action in this event is that,
when the subscriber state subsequently becomes Idle, the HLR A is
informed and a Resume indication is sent towards the destination B
network at the appropriate time.

6.2 MSC/VLR Monitoring Model 
----------------------------

The Monitoring model represents the information related to the status of
the subscriber connection in the MSC/VLR. A generic monitoring model is
used in the MSC/VLR covering the needs of both subscriber A and
subscriber B state information for CCBS. The MSC/VLR monitoring model
for CCBS is shown in figure 6.2.1. Note that state transitions reported
to the HLR are shown as solid lines.

Figure 6.2.1: MSC/VLR Monitoring Model

### 6.2.1 Subscriber status

The monitoring model in the MSC/VLR makes use of the three subscriber
states described in table 6.2.1.

NOTE: Refer to TS 23.078 for equivalent subscriber state description.

### 6.2.2 Reporting of subscriber state transitions

Transitions between subscriber states are reported from the MSC/VLR,
while monitoring in the MSC/VLR is on going. The table 6.2.2 indicates
which transitions are monitored in the MSC/VLR and whether these are
reported to the HLR for the CCBS service. An appropriate Event Report
signal is sent from the VLR to the HLR when a relevant state transition
occurs. The Event Report signal includes a status parameter which
reflects the subscriber state information.

Table 6.2.2: Reporting of Subscriber States Transitions

  --------------------------------------- -------------------- ---------------------
  **Subscriber state transition event**   **Event reporting\   **Event report\
                                          HLR informed**       Subscriber status**

  IDLE to NOT IDLE                        Yes                  CCBS Not Idle

  IDLE to NOT REACHABLE                   Yes                  CCBS Not Reachable

  NOT IDLE to IDLE                        Yes                  CCBS Idle

  NOT IDLE to NOT REACHABLE               No                   \-

  NOT REACHABLE to IDLE                   Yes                  CCBS Idle

  NOT REACHABLE to NOT IDLE               No                   \-
  --------------------------------------- -------------------- ---------------------

#### 6.2.2.1 Start Reporting of Monitoring Events

When a Start Reporting signal is received from the HLR, the VLR shall
acknowledge the request confirming that monitoring has started and
indicate the current status of the subscriber state in the MSC/VLR. The
VLR shall subsequently continue to send the Event Reports indicated in
table 6.2.2 whenever the appropriate subscriber state transition event
occurs.

Note where a single user has a CCBS request activated against him and
has an outstanding CCBS request suspended against someone else, (i.e. is
effectively both destination B and CCBS subscriber A) reporting on both
A-side and B-side is required. In this case, the VLR shall only send a
single Event Report as indicated in table 6.2.2 whenever the appropriate
subscriber state transition event occurs. The HLR shall not send another
Start Reporting signal to the VLR if monitoring is already ongoing in
the MSC/VLR for either A-side or the B-side.

#### 6.2.2.2 Stop Reporting of Monitoring Events

When a Stop Reporting signal is received from the HLR, the VLR shall
stop sending the Event Reports.

6.3 CCBS Call Reporting 
-----------------------

### 6.3.1 Overview

As well as monitoring of the subscriber state, it is also necessary to
report the result of the CCBS Call. The basic reporting requirements are
as follows from both the A-side and the B-side.

**CCBS Call Reporting - A-side:**

The CCBS service logic in the originating network HLR A requires a
report on the outcome of the CCBS Call resulting from the acceptance of
the CCBS Recall by Subscriber A. The VLR A sends a CCBS Call Report to
the HLR A indicating the outcome of the CCBS call processing in
MSC/VLR A when e.g. an address complete message (ACM) is received from
the destination B network. CCBS Call Reporting on the A-side is
completely independent of any monitoring of subscriber state
information. The sending of CCBS Call Report is required even when there
is no monitoring ongoing in the MSC/VLR.

**CCBS Call Reporting- B-side:**

The CCBS service logic in the destination network HLR B requires a
report on the outcome of CCBS Call processing in the MSC/VLR B. The
HLR B initiates the CCBS call outcome reporting in the VLR when the VLR
is normally queried to provide routing information for mobile terminated
calls (by including an CCBS indicator in the PRN message). The VLR B
sends a CCBS Call Report to the HLR B indicating the outcome of the CCBS
call processing and the new status of the subscriber state in the
MSC/VLR B when e.g. MS B is alerted to the CCBS Call.

### 6.3.2 Originating Network (A-side) 

When a CCBS RUF signal is received by the VLR, CCBS processing in the
MSC/VLR leads to a CCBS Recall signal being sent to the MS. When the
response to the CCBS Recall is received, the VLR shall subsequently send
a CCBS Call Report when the relevant processing for the outgoing CCBS
call to the destination network is completed as shown in the SDLs for
MSC/VLR A.

### 6.3.3 Destination Network (B-side) 

When an initiate CCBS Call Reporting Request signal (B-side) is received
by the VLR in the Provide Roaming Number message, the VLR shall
subsequently send a CCBS Call Report when the relevant processing of the
incoming CCBS call is completed as shown in the SDLs for MSC/VLR B.

#### 6.3.3.1 Interaction of Event Reporting and CCBS Call Report

Reporting on subscriber state transitions will be ongoing in the MSC/VLR
B when a report on the CCBS call outcome is required.

When a subscriber state transition from IDLE to NOT IDLE occurs due to
an incoming CCBS call, an Event Report shall not be sent. Instead, a
CCBS Call Report (containing CCBS call outcome information and the
status) shall be sent to the HLR B. After the CCBS Call Report has been
sent, normal Event Reporting will continue i.e. the VLR shall
subsequently send only the Event Reports indicated in table 6.2.2 when
the next appropriate subscriber state transition event occurs.

6.4 Location Update
-------------------

The MS may roam to a new MSC/VLR area while monitoring is ongoing in the
previous MSC/VLR. When the VLR receives a Cancel Location signal from
the HLR due to normal mobility management procedures, any ongoing CCBS
related activities associated with the subscriber shall cease.

If the A-side monitoring is ongoing when the HLR receives a Location
Update request from the VLR, the Location Update signal is considered to
indicate that the subscriber state is idle and the appropriate CCBS
process in the HLR is informed. The normal mobility management
procedures will lead to a Cancel Location signal being sent to the old
VLR causing the Event Reporting to stop.

If the B-side monitoring is ongoing when the HLR receives a Location
Update request from the VLR, the normal mobility management procedures
are followed. On successful completion of Location Update procedure, the
HLR shall send a Start Reporting signal to the new VLR. If during the
handling of the normal Location Updating procedure, it is detected that
the new MSC/VLR does not support CCBS, the HLR shall not send a Start
Reporting signal to the new VLR.

NOTE: There is no impact to the MS due to CCBS monitoring, i.e. normal
Location Update procedures apply.

7 Mobility
==========

The handling for CCBS specific mobility is described below.

7.1 Mobility during Activation
------------------------------

In order to allow the activation of CCBS when the call is released, the
CC connection towards the MS shall be kept, to avoid any problems of
mobility with the MS A.

Therefore the MSC shall maintain the CC connection with the MS A while
T1 is running and until either T1 expires or the MSC sends a CCBS
REQUEST ACK or CCBS REQUEST ERROR to the MS. After MSC has sent CCBS
REQUEST ACK or CCBS REQUEST ERROR, the MSC A shall release the CC
connection with MS.

7.2 Number used within CCBS Call
--------------------------------

The activating MSC A shall store the originally dialled number in the
Call Information container. The TranslatedBNo parameter shall contain
destination B address stored in international E.164 format.

If the MS A is registered outside of the HPLMN during the initial call
or when Remote\_User\_Free is received from the destination B network
the HLR A may request the recall MSC A to change the number used for
CCBS Call to the TranslatedBNo instead. Refer to the SDLs for
originating MSC/VLR.

If CAMEL service was activated in the original call the HLR A shall not
request to change the number used for the CCBS Call.

7.3 MS does Location Update
---------------------------

CCBS does place extra requirements for the Location Update procedure in
the HLR when MS is monitored. Refer to subclause 6.4.

7.4 Mobility during CCBS Call in the destination network
--------------------------------------------------------

If MS registers to non-supporting network special handling has to be
applied. Refer to subclause 10.1.3.

8 Interaction with other supplementary services
===============================================

TS 22.093 specifies a number of interactions between CCBS and other
supplementary services. Additional details of how these interactions
apply are as follows.

8.1 Call forwarding unconditional (CFU)
---------------------------------------

If a call to destination B is forwarded to subscriber C by CFU and MS C
is NDUB, the GMSC shall inform MSC A that CCBS is not possible when it
releases the call. Refer to Process MT\_GMSC (see TS 23.018) for further
details.

If destination B activates CFU after subscriber A has activated a CCBS
Request against destination B, HLR B shall not process CCBS Requests in
the queue which are related to the relevant Basic Service Group, except
that T7 shall continue for each CCBS Request in the destination B queue.
If T7 expires for a particular request, HLR B shall cancel the request,
as described in the SDLs shown in figure 11.2.2.1.

If MSC B is monitoring MS B when CFU is activated by destination B and
all the CCBS Requests in the destination B queue subsequently become
\"Active and Quiescent\", then HLR B shall send \"Stop Reporting\" to
MSC B. If destination B deactivates CFU resulting in one or more
requests becoming \"Active and Operative\" in the destination B queue
then, HLR B shall send \"Start Reporting\" to MSC B if monitoring is not
already ongoing.

A CCBS Call shall be forwarded without the CCBS call Indicator.

8.2 Call forward on busy (CFB)
------------------------------

If a call to destination B is forwarded to subscriber C by CFB and MS C
is NDUB, the forwarding switch (GMSC or VMSC) shall inform MSC A that
CCBS is possible when it releases the call. Refer to Process MT\_GMSC or
Process ICH\_MSC (see TS 23.018) for further details.

If destination B activates CFB after subscriber A has activated a CCBS
Request against destination B, HLR B shall continue to process CCBS
Requests in the queue. If a CCBS Call subsequently arrives at MSC B and
MS B is NDUB, a network provider option exists as to whether:

\- the CCBS call shall be treated as when MS B is busy for the CCBS
call, without CFB active; or

\- the CCBS call shall be forwarded without the CCBS call Indicator.

8.3 Call forwarding on no reply (CFNRy)
---------------------------------------

If a call to destination B is forwarded to subscriber C by CFNRy and MS
C is NDUB, the forwarding switch (VMSC) shall inform MSC A that CCBS is
not possible when it releases the call. Refer to Process MT\_GMSC or
Process ICH\_MSC (see TS 23.018) for further details

If destination B activates CFNRy after subscriber A has activated a CCBS
Request against destination B, HLR B shall continue to process CCBS
Requests in the queue.

A CCBS call shall be forwarded without the CCBS call Indicator.

8.4 Call forwarding on MS not reachable (CFNRc)
-----------------------------------------------

If a call to destination B is forwarded to subscriber C by CFNRc and MS
C is NDUB, the forwarding switch (GMSC or VMSC) shall inform MSC A that
CCBS is not possible when it releases the call. Refer to Process
MT\_GMSC or Process\_ICH\_MSC (see TS 23.018) for further details.

If destination B activates CFNRc after subscriber A has activated a CCBS
Request against destination B, HLR B shall continue to process CCBS
Requests in the queue.

The CCBS call shall be forwarded without the CCBS call Indicator.

8.5 Call Waiting (CW)
---------------------

No impact.

8.6 Multiparty service (MPTY)
-----------------------------

No impact.

8.7 Closed user group (CUG)
---------------------------

No impact.

8.8 Advice Of Charge (AoC)
--------------------------

If subscriber A accepts a \"CCBS Recall\" indication but ACMmax exceeds,
then MSC A shall cancel the associated request and shall not establish
the CCBS Call.

8.9 Barring of all outgoing calls (BAOC)
----------------------------------------

If subscriber A accepts a \"CCBS Recall\" indication but MSC A detects
that BAOC is active and operative, then MSC A shall cancel the
associated request and shall not establish the CCBS Call.

8.10 Barring of outgoing international calls (BOIC)
---------------------------------------------------

If subscriber A accepts a \"CCBS Recall\" indication but the CCBS Call
would be an international call and MSC A detects that BOIC is active and
operative, then MSC A shall cancel the associated request and shall not
establish the CCBS Call.

8.11 Barring of outgoing international calls except those directed to the home PLMN country (BOIC-exHC)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If subscriber A accepts a \"CCBS Recall\" indication but the CCBS Call
would be an international call except to the home PLMN country and MSC A
detects that BOIC-exHC is active and operative, then MSC A shall cancel
the associated request and shall not establish the CCBS Call.

8.12 Barring of all incoming calls (BAIC)
-----------------------------------------

If a CCBS Request arrives at HLR B and HLR B detects that BAIC is active
and operative for the relevant Basic Service Group, then HLR B shall not
accept the activation attempt and shall indicate short term denial in
the response.

If MSC B is monitoring MS B when BAIC is activated by destination B then
all the CCBS Requests in the destination B queue subsequently become
\"Active and Quiescent\" and HLR B shall send \"Stop Reporting\" to
MSC B. If destination B deactivates BAIC resulting in one or more
requests becoming \"Active and Operative\" in the destination B queue
then, HLR B shall send \"Start Reporting\" to MSC B if monitoring is not
already ongoing.

If barring of all incoming calls becomes active and operative for a
particular Basic Service Group for destination B, such that a CCBS call
from subscriber A is not permitted, HLR B shall cancel the associated
request related to the Basic Service Group and select the next
non-suspended request in the queue for processing for other Basic
Service Groups.

8.13 Barring of incoming calls when roaming outside the home PLMN country (BIC-Roam)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If a CCBS Request arrives at HLR B and HLR B detects that BIC-Roam is
active and operative for the relevant Basic Service Group, then HLR B
shall not accept the activation attempt and shall indicate short term
denial in the response.

If MSC B is monitoring MS B when BIC-Roam is activated by destination B
then all the CCBS Requests in the destination B queue subsequently
become \"Active and Quiescent\" and HLR B shall send \"Stop Reporting\"
to MSC B. If destination B deactivates BIC-Roam resulting in one or more
requests becoming \"Active and Operative\" in the destination B queue
then, HLR B shall send \"Start Reporting\" to MSC B if monitoring is not
already ongoing.

If barring of incoming calls when roaming outside the home PLMN country
becomes active and operative for a particular Basic Service Group for
destination B, such that a CCBS call from subscriber A is not permitted,
HLR B shall cancel the associated request related to the Basic Service
Group and select the next non-suspended request in the queue for
processing for other Basic Service Groups.

8.14 Completion of calls to busy subscriber (CCBS) 
--------------------------------------------------

Subscriber A may have successfully activated one or more CCBS requests
against different destinations B, and also have one or more CCBS
requests successfully activated against him by different subscribers. In
this case, HLR A shall co-ordinate the different requests.

Checking for an identical CCBS request already existing shall include
checks in both directions, i.e. if subscriber A activates a CCBS Request
against destination B, HLR A shall check subscriber A\'s originating
queue for any previous requests activated by subscriber A against
destination B for the same basic service group. HLR A shall also check
subscriber A\'s target queue for any requests activated by destination B
against subscriber A for the same basic service group.

9 Interaction with other network features
=========================================

TS 22.093 specifies a number of interactions between CCBS and other
network features.

9.1 Customised Applications for Mobile network Enhanced Logic (CAMEL)
---------------------------------------------------------------------

For a terminating CAMEL based service which changes the destination B
address for the original call which subsequently encounters NDUB, the
GMSC shall inform originating network that CCBS is not possible when it
releases the call.

If an originating CAMEL based service determines for a CCBS Call a
different destination B Address than for the original call, the CCBS
Call shall be released and the associated CCBS Request shall be
cancelled.

If the CAMEL based service requests a call set-up to an alternative
destination after the original call has met Busy, CCBS Possible
condition, the CCBS activation shall be allowed if the alternative call
set-up also encounters Busy condition.

9.2 Support of Optimal Routeing (SOR) 
-------------------------------------

The CCBS supporting GMSC shall include CCBS Supported indicator to the
SRI message.

If HLR B receives a request for routeing information when destination B
is blocked (i.e. the HLR B is waiting for an SRI for a CCBS call set-up)
and the SRI does not include a CCBS call indicator nor CCBS supported in
the GMSC indicator and the request is from a GMSC not in the same PLMN
as HLR B, then HLR B shall return an SRI negative response indicating OR
not allowed. This will force the GMSC to route the call to a GMSC in the
same PLMN as HLR B (see TS 23.079).

The GMSC in HPLMN B should be able to include the CCBS Call indicator in
the non-OR SRI, and the CCBS call set-up will proceed, although it
won\'t be optimally routed.

If the HLR receives an SRI indicating a CCBS-capable GMSC but not a CCBS
call while awaiting SRI for a CCBS call, it can treat the request as if
the B-subscriber were busy, regardless of where the GMSC is.

10 Interworking with other networks
===================================

The point of interworking shall be the interface between HLR A and
HLR B. The flow of information across this interface shall be identical
to that between exchanges for the ISDN version of CCBS.

Interworking with ISDNs which support the ISDN version of CCBS is
therefore available without further modification.

Interworking with networks other than ISDNs, e.g. private networks, is
not specified here, but is not precluded.

CCBS shall be able to interwork through networks which do not support
CCBS. In this situation, the CCBS service may fail.

10.1 Interworking with network entities not supporting CCBS
-----------------------------------------------------------

CCBS requires support of the service by the following entities for it to
operate as specified above:

\- MS A;

\- MSC A;

\- VLR A;

\- HLR A;

\- GMSC;

\- HLR B;

\- MSC B;

\- VLR B.

The following shows the actions required to cover the situations where
these entities do not support CCBS. Note that the situation is further
complicated by mobility. For example, MSC A may support CCBS when the
initial request is made, but if subscriber A has changed location, the
new MSC A may not support CCBS.

It is assumed that the entities support the service at the points in the
call where actions are initiated by them, and that an entity which
receives an indication for the CCBS service but does not support it can
indicate its lack of support to the sending entity.

### 10.1.1 CCBS not supported by MSC A

HLR A knows whether the MSC A supports CCBS or not through the transfer
of subscriber data.

[MS B becomes idle]{.underline}

When HLR A receives the \"Remote User Free\" indication for a particular
CCBS Request and detects that the MSC A where MS A is currently
registered does not support CCBS, then HLR A shall suspend the
corresponding CCBS Request and shall send \"CCBS Suspend\" to HLR B.
When MS A registers in a different MSC which supports CCBS, HLR A shall
resume the corresponding CCBS Request and shall send \"CCBS Resume\" to
HLR B, continuing as if MS A had become free.

### 10.1.2 CCBS not supported by HLR B

Initial call encounters busy

If an MSC B that supports CCBS recognises that HLR B does not support
CCBS then \"CCBS Not Possible\" will be generated in the CCBS
diagnostic.

### 10.1.3 CCBS not supported by MSC B

HLR B knows whether the MSC B supports CCBS or not through the transfer
of subscriber data.

[CCBS Request]{.underline}

If MSC B does not support CCBS, HLR B acknowledge the request and start
T7. No processing of the destination B queue and subsequently no
monitoring of destination B will be possible until destination B
registers in a supporting MSC.

[CCBS Call set-up]{.underline}

If HLR B knows that MSC B does not support CCBS the HLR B shall delete
the corresponding CCBS Request and shall request a Roaming No without
including the CCBS Call indicator in the request. Within Send Routeing
Info Ack the HLR shall inform the GMSC to remove CCBS Call Indicator
from the IAM message.

After a \"Remote User Free\" has been sent from MSC B but before the
CCBS call set-up is completed, destination B may register in an MSC
which does not support the service. MSC B shall accept the CCBS call,
but MSC B will not be able to inform HLR B of the successful completion
of the CCBS call, so the request will remain active in HLR B until the
recall B timer (T9) expires and the request is cancelled.

11 Network entity functions
===========================

The following SDL diagrams describe the various processes and procedures
within individual network entities for handling CCBS. The SDL diagrams
are as follows:

11.1 Originating Network Processes
----------------------------------

### 11.1.1 Processes and procedures in MSC/VLR

Figure 11.1.1.1: Process MSC\_CCBS\_Recall\_Manager

This process controls the CCBS Recall handling in the MSC and controls
timers T4 and T10

Figure 11.1.1.2: Process VLR\_CCBS\_Recall\_Manager

This process controls the CCBS Recall handling in the VLR and reports
the result of the Recall directly to the HLR.

Figure 11.1.1.3: Process OCH\_CCBS\_VLR

This process controls the CCBS Call Setup in the VLR

Figure 11.1.1.4: Procedure CCBS\_Check\_OG\_Call

This procedure checks whether the outgoing call meets various conditions
set by the CCBS supplementary service. If CCBS is not implemented Pass
exit shall be taken.

Figure 11.1.1.5: Procedure CCBS\_Check\_If\_CCBS\_Possible

This procedure is called when Release message is received from the
destination network. It checks whether CCBS activation is possible.

Figure 11.1.1.6: Procedure CCBS\_Activation\_MSC

If CCBS activation is possible this procedure is called. It handles the
dialogue between MS and MSC and MSC and HLR respectively.

Figure 11.1.1.7: Procedure Page\_MS\_MSC\_For\_Recall

During CCBS recall this procedure handles paging of the MS if the

### 11.1.2 Processes and procedures in HLR

Figure 11.1.2.1: Block diagram of HLRA processes

Figure 11.1.2.2: Process HLRA\_Request\_Manager

This process is in charge of the user interface procedures and queue
handling, i.e. whether the request to processed is present in the queue
or not.

The process has three states, \"Idle\", \"Operative\" and \"Operative
Resuming\". In the \"Idle\" state the queue is empty and the only
actions to queue are creation of new request and interrogation of the
queue. In other states activation, interrogation and deactivation
procedures similarly, that is why they are grouped under \"\*\" state.

Whenever the first request is created the process changes it\'s state to
\"Operative\", in this state there are request(s) in the queue and none
of them are suspended.

When HLRA\_Request reports of suspension the process changes it\'s state
to \"Operative Resuming\" and the HLRA\_Resume is started with correct
trigger signal i.e. idle indication from MSC or recall end is waited.

Only NET suspended request can be selected and resumed, USER type
suspended requests remain as suspended until them are marked as NET
suspended. This happens when idle indication is received from the MSC.

The resuming process is paused if there is new suspended request with
cause code Not reach i.e. The resuming starts again when idle condition
is met again or there is a new recall with successful outcome i.e. the
recall ends without Not Reach indication.

The resuming process will be stopped, if there are no suspended requests
in the queue any more. The process changes it\'s state to normal
\"Operative\" or \"Idle\" state.

Figure 11.1.2.3: Process HLRA\_Request

This process is created during the activation of service and contains
all related data. The process has five different states,
\"Wait\_For\_Answer\", \"Active\", \"Recall\", \"Suspended\" and
\"Frozen\". During its creation the process sends CCBS\_Request via SSAP
interface to destination network B containing all call related data as
well originating networks retention capabilities.

In the \"Wait\_For\_Answer\" state process receives response from
destination network which is further relayed to the
HLRA\_Request\_Manager. In case of positive acknowledgement destination
network returns info whether the retention is supported in both
networks.

In \"Active\" state process waits recall from destination network,
however process can vanish if operation timer T3 expires or explicit
deletion is received from the user or destination network. In case of
deletion the process informs the queue. When the recall arrives the
process transits to the \"Recall\" state.

In the \"Recall\" state process waits the recall outcome, either
positive or negative. Depending of the recall outcome the request can be
deleted, retained or suspended. If the request is to be retained the
process transits back to the \"Active\" state. If the request is
suspended due to the T10 expiry, CCBS\_Busy condition or the MS is not
reachable the process transits to the suspended state.

If the request is deleted during \"Recall\" due SSAP\_Cancel, T3 expiry
or explicit deletion the queue is updated immediately and the request
changes it\'s state to \"Recall Deleted\" where it waits the recall to
end.

In the \"Suspended\" state actions the request can be resumed if the MS
is known to be CCBS\_Idle or the request can be deleted due to the
explicit deletion or timer T3 expiry.

The request is placed in \"Frozen\" state whenever it receives Remote
User Free indication from the destination network and the request can\'t
be fulfilled due service interaction or lack of support in MSCVLR. The
request shall indicate suspended back to the destination network and
stay in the queue. If the service becomes later possible, the request
will revert back \"Active\" state and indicate resumed to the
destination network.

Whenever the state of the process is changed, the new state is stored
and the procedure CCBS\_Notify\_SS\_Invocation is called.

Figure 11.1.2.4: Process HLRA\_Recall\_Manager

This process has two different states, \"Idle\" and \"CCBS\_Busy\".

The process let\'s only one individual process to be in recall state in
a time and have a dialogue open to the MSC and it changes it\'s state to
\"CCBS\_Busy\". In this state other requests are suspended immediately
and marked as NET suspended with cause code = Busy.

In \"CCBS\_Busy\" state the process waits recall reporting from the MSC.
Possible inputs from the MSC are CCBS\_RUF\_Ack, CCBS\_RUF\_Error and
CCBS\_Call\_Report. CCBS\_Call\_Report can be received if the subscriber
has accepted the recall, otherwise the process changes it\'s state back
to \"Idle\". If the process receives Query\_State request from the
HLRA\_Resume during the recall the process informs the resume process
whether a recall is being processed.

Figure 11.1.2.5: Process HLRA\_Resume

The process has four different states, \"Idle\", \"Resume pending\",
\"Wait For Selection\" and \"Resuming\". The process is started when a
request is suspended. For the first suspended request it is also set the
trigger point i.e. when it is correct to send out selection request for
resuming. Two triggers are provided, A\_Idle from the monitoring process
and Recall\_End from the recall handling. If the trigger is set to
A\_Idle the monitoring process is also started.

When the process is started and correct trigger is set the process waits
in the \"Resume pending\" state to receive a permission to start
resuming. When the permission is received the process asks for the first
NET request to resumed. If A\_Idle signal is received from the
monitoring process the resuming process asks the queue manager to set
all suspended requests as NET type in order to allow the selection.

When there are no active suspended request in the queue any more the
resuming process is stopped i.e. when the \"Deleted\" signal in the
HLRA\_Request\_Manager is handled.

Figure 11.1.2.6: Process HLRA\_Monitoring

Monitoring process has two different states, \"Idle\" and
\"Monitoring\". Receival of \"A\_Query\" signal transits the process to
\"Monitoring\" state. In this state the process reports \"Idle\"
condition to the resuming process and starts the monitoring again in the
MSC if location update or restore data happens.

Figure 11.1.2.7: Procedure HLRA\_CCBS\_Check\_Interactions

This procedure checks whether the Remote User Free indication can be
delivered to the MSCVLR or not.

Figure 11.1.2.8: Procedure CCBS\_Notify\_SS\_Invocation

This procedure is called by the process HLRA\_Request whenever there is
a change of state. The procedure informs the gsmSCF of the state change
if the SS-CSI applicable to CCBS is stored in the HLR.

Figure 11.1.2.1: HLRA Processes

NOTE: Figure 11.1.2.1 is one possible method of implementing queue
processing in HLR A. Manufacturers are not constrained to follow the
implementation given in figure 11.1.2.1. However, the external behaviour
of HLR A shall appear to be the same.

**Description of above signals:**

**Relation HLRA\_Request\_Manager and HLRA\_Request**

[CCBS\_Request\_Ack]{.underline} signal is acknowledgement of a
successful activation from the individual request to the queue manager.

[CCBS\_Request\_Error]{.underline} signal is sent if the destination
networks queue is full or the destination networks queue size is set to
zero. The individual request is deleted from the originating side.

[Suspend]{.underline} is used within HLRA\_Request and
HLRA\_Request\_Manager. The queue shall update it\'s internal
information.

[Delete]{.underline} is used within HLRA\_Request\_Manager and
HLRA\_Request. The queue manager instructs the individual request the
request to die.

[Deleted]{.underline} is used within HLRA\_Request\_Manager and
HLRA\_Request. The individual request informs the queue of its expiry.

[Resume]{.underline} is used within HLRA\_Request\_Manager and
HLRA\_Request. The individual request is resumed and it shall inform the
destination network of the resumption.

**Relation HLRA\_Request\_Manager and HLRA\_Resume**

[Set\_Trigger\_Recall\_End]{.underline} is used within the
HLRA\_Request\_Manager and HLRA\_Resume. If resuming is not ongoing this
signal set the resuming process to the \"ResumePending\" state and query
is sent to the recall process.

[Set\_Trigger\_A\_Idle]{.underline} is used within the
HLRA\_request\_manager and HLRA\_resume. If resuming is not ongoing this
signal set the resuming process to the \"ResumePending\" state. In all
cases this causes \"A\_Query\" signal to be sent.

[Reset\_Trigger\_A\_Idle]{.underline} is used within the
HLRA\_request\_manager and HLRA\_resume. This signal sets the resuming
process to the \"ResumePending\" state and causes \"A\_Query\" signal to
be sent.

[Select\_Resp]{.underline} is used within the HLRA\_request\_manager and
HLRA\_resume. This signal informs the resuming process to start T11.

[Not\_Selected]{.underline} is used within the HLRA\_request\_manager
and HLRA\_resume. This signal informs the resuming process that the
selection was not done and the process will transit to \"ResumePending\"
state.

[Stop\_Resume]{.underline} is used within the HLRA\_request\_manager and
HLRA\_resume. This signal informs the resuming process to stop it\'s
actions and stop the monitoring also.

[Set\_All\_Active]{.underline} is used within the HLRA\_Resume and
HLRA\_request\_manager. This signal informs the queue to set all
suspended requests as NET suspended and later on they can be resumed.

[Select\_Active\_Req]{.underline} is used within the HLRA\_Resume and
HLRA\_request\_manager. This signal informs the queue to select first
NET suspended request to be resumed. If successful the request process
will return \"Select\_Resp\", otherwise \"Not\_Selected\".

[Select\_First\_Req]{.underline} is used within the HLRA\_Resume and
HLRA\_request\_manager. This signal informs the queue to select first
suspended request to be resumed. If successful the request process will
return \"Select\_Resp\", otherwise \"Not\_Selected\".

**Relation HLRA\_Recall\_Manager and HLRA\_Request**

[Recall]{.underline} is used within HLRA\_Request and
HLRA\_Recall\_Manager. It contains all call related data in order to
form the CCBS\_Call.

[Completed]{.underline} is used within the HLRA\_Recall\_Manager and
HLRA\_Request. It informs the request of successful CCBS\_Call and
causes the request to vanish.

[Failure]{.underline} is used within the HLRA\_Recall\_Manager and
HLRA\_Request. It informs the request of unsuccessful CCBS\_Call and
causes the request to vanish.

[Busy]{.underline} is used within the HLRA\_Recall\_Manager and
HLRA\_Request. It informs the request of unsuccessful CCBS\_Call and
causes the request to vanish if retention is not supported.

[Suspend]{.underline} is used within HLRA\_ Recall\_Manager and HLRA\_
Request. The request shall change it\'s state and report the suspension
to the queue manager.

**Relation HLRA\_Monitoring and HLRA\_Resume**

[A\_Query]{.underline} is used within HLRA\_Resume and HLRA\_Monitoring.
It instruct the HLRA\_Monitoring to start it\'s actions and return the
idle condition when possible.

[A\_Idle]{.underline} is used within HLRA\_Monitoring and HLRA\_Resume.
It informs the resuming process that the subscriber is now CCBS\_Idle
and not CCBS\_Busy.

[Stop\_Monitoring]{.underline} is used with HLRA\_Resume and
HLRA\_Monitoring. It instructs the monitoring process to stop it\'s
actions and stop the monitoring from VLR also.

[Location\_Update/Restore\_Data]{.underline} events are tracked and
external reporting is started again.

----------------------------------

### 11.2.1 Procedures in GMSC

Figure 11.2.1.1: Procedure CCBS\_MT\_GMSC\_Check\_CCBS\_Call

This procedure checks from the IAM message whether the call is CCBS
call. If that is the case the CCBS Call parameter is set to the Send
Routeing Info message. This functionality shall be applied only to the
initial call leg. The procedure initialises also the CCBS Possible
variable as True, the variable is accessible to all CCBS specific
procedures in the GMSC.

Figure 11.2.1.2: Procedure CCBS\_MT\_GMSC\_Check\_CCBS\_Indicators

This procedure sets the CCBS\_Call indicator to the outgoing IAM message
when needed. This functionality shall be applied only to the initial
call leg.

Figure 11.2.1.3: Procedure
CCBS\_MT\_GMSC\_Remove\_Indicators\_Store\_FWT

This procedure removes CCBS\_Call indicator from the forwarded IAM
message and also stores the forwarding type. It also checks whether
subscriber B can be target of CCBS Requests and stores that information
for later use.

Figure 11.2.1.4: Procedure CCBS\_MT\_GMSC\_Remove\_Indicators

This procedure removes CCBS\_Call indicator from the outgoing IAM
message. CCBS activation is not possible for this call because T-CSI
modified destination address.

Figure 11.2.1.5: Procedure CCBS\_MT\_GMSC\_Check\_CCBS\_Possible

This procedure contains the core logic to handle various interactions
with CAMEL, OR and received Release message content. The procedure
alters CCBS specific global variable CCBS Target which controls setting
of the diagnostic field in the Release message towards the originating
network.

Global variables Reconnect and Resume Call are specific to CAMEL and OR
interaction respectively. They are initialised and updated in the
process MT\_GMSC or MT\_CF\_MSC, refer to TS 23.018.

### 11.2.2 Processes and procedures in HLR

Figure 11.2.2.1: Block diagram of HLRB\_processes

Figure 11.2.2.2: Process HLRB\_Request\_Manager

This process has the task of controlling the queue and determining
whether requests to be processed are present in the queue or not.

The process has two states \"idle\" and \"active\". In the \"idle\"
state there are no \"operative\" requests in the queue i.e. there are
only suspended requests or no requests at all. In the \"active\" state
there is at least one \"operative\" request in the queue which needs
processing. A transition from \"idle\" to \"active\" will trigger this
process to start the process \"HLRB\_Recall\_Manager\". Only a
transition from \"active\" to \"idle\" will result in this process
stopping the process \"HLRB\_Recall\_Manager\".

Figure 11.2.2.3: Process HLRB\_Request

This process represents an individual CCBS request on the destination
side. Reception of signals on the external interface (SSAP signalling)
are handled by this process.

Retention is handled by this process. The individual request is informed
by the Recall manager process about the outcome of the CCBS Call. The
individual request is in charge to decide on whether it will stay in the
destination queue (retention) or not according to its data stored.

T7 expiry is controlled by the individual request in that way, that it
remembers T7 expiry when it is the selected request (i.e. a CCBS Recall
has been initiated for this request). The event is detected after the
CCBS Recall when retention has kept the request in the queue.

Figure 11.2.2.4: Process HLRB\_Recall Manager

This process is in charge of the recall handling. It is started and
stopped by the process \"HLRB\_Request\_Manager\" depending on whether
there are operative requests in the terminating queue or not.

As soon as this process is started, it will start the process
\"HLRB\_Monitoring\" and wait for a response from this process. The
response indicates that user B is idle guarded i.e. a CCBS Recall can be
initiated. Hence, the process asks the request manager for selection of
an individual request from the terminating queue.

When an individual process is selected, the process initiates a CCBS
Recall via the individual request (since the external interface is tied
to the individual request), starts T9 and takes over control of the
blocking function while waiting for the CCBS Call. Control of blocking
is done by sending the signal \"Recall\_Block\" to process
\"HLRB\_Blocking\".

While waiting for the outcome of the CCBS Call, the process will be
informed either by the selected individual request in the case of
negative outcome (suspension or cancellation, both hidden to the
process), or by process \"HLRB\_Monitoring\" in the case the CCBS Call
has reached the terminating PLMN.

Figure 11.2.2.5: Process HLRB\_Monitoring

This process takes care of monitoring events received from MSC/VLR and
detects potential conditions for initiating a CCBS Recall.

The process is controlled by the \"HLRB\_Recall\_Manager\" process which
was formerly in charge of detecting the recall condition.

When the process is started, it invokes the monitoring function in the
MSC/VLR and awaits the first event report. The process keeps track of
the subscriber state changes by running a state machine which reflects
the subscriber states. When there is a transition from subscriber state
\"not idle\" to \"idle\", then T8 is started. As soon as T8 expires, the
process changes state again in order to remember that the subscriber is
now idle guarded and a recall could be initiated

Whether a CCBS Recall is initiated or not depends on whether the process
\"HLRB\_Recall\_Manager\" has asked for this information by sending a
\"B\_Query\" signal to the monitoring process. The process
\"HLRB\_Monitoring\" gives this information only if the \"B\_Query\"
signal has been received. This is done by sending the signal
\"B\_Guarded\" to the Recall Manager and it is only done once per
request. The monitoring process keeps track on whether a query was
received or not by appropriate state changes.

As the monitoring process is in charge for the idle guard function, it
also controls the blocking of incoming calls during the idle guard time
(T8). Hence, when the recall manager process has sent a \"B\_Query\"
(i.e. a CCBS request needs to be processed) then the monitoring process
starts the corresponding blocking along with T8. The blocking is only
stopped if T8 does not expire. If T8 expires, then blocking is still
needed for the following CCBS Recall. The responsibility for controlling
the blocking (i.e. switching it off) is given to the recall manager
process.

Figure 11.2.2.6: Process HLRB\_Blocking

This process controls the CCBS Call delivery reporting when the
processes are in the proper state. This means that the reporting
functionality of the outcome of the CCBS Call is not blindly triggered
whenever there is a terminating CCBS Call.

The process has three different states: \"idle\", \"Blocking\" and
\"Recall Blocking\". The \"Idle\" state reflects the case when blocking
is disabled. In the \"Blocking\" state all incoming calls are blocked
(e.g. while T8 is running). The \"Recall Blocking\" state allows one
CCBS Call to pass, which will trigger the CCBS Call delivery reporting
in the MSC/VLR via the TS 23.018 process \"SRI\_HLR\". When this
happens, the process will automatically change back to state
\"Blocking\" as no other CCBS Call is expected for now.

When the process has detected that destination B is idle, it will start
the blocking. Hence, the blocking process will change state to
\"Blocking\". As soon as the process \"HLRB\_Recall\_Manager\" has
initiated a CCBS Recall, it will cause a state change in the blocking
process to state \"Recall Blocking\". When the CCBS Call is received,
\"result = OK\" indication in signal \"SRI\_Received\_Ack\" will trigger
the reporting mechanism for CCBS Call delivery via a PRN request in the
TS 23.018 process \"SRI\_HLR\".

For Figure 11.2.2.6, sheet 2: The procedure Handle\_CFB is specified in
TS 23.018, clause 7.3.2.6.

Figure 11.2.2.7: Procedure HLRB\_CCBS\_Check\_Interactions

This procedure checks whether the request is frozen due to the
supplementary service interactions.

Figure 11.2.2.8: Procedure CCBS\_Handling\_HLR

This procedure is called during Send Routeing Info message handling in
the HLR. If blocking is active only CCBS Calls can proceed, others will
fail with busy or forward indication. For CCBS Call CCBS Call Indicator
is set to the Provide Roaming Number message.

Figure 11.2.2.9: Procedure CCBS\_Report\_PRN\_Failure

This procedure is called if Provide Roaming Number returns an error. For
CCBS call is then generated an internal call report.

The handling of multiple requests in HLR B can be further clarified by
the diagram shown in figure 11.2.2.1.

Figure 11.2.2.1: HLRB\_Processes

**Description of above signals**

**Relation Originating Network and HLRB\_Request\_Manager**

[CCBS\_Request]{.underline}: When the originating network attempts to
activate CCBS, it sends a CCBS\_Request message to HLRB Request Manager.

[CCBS\_Request\_Ack]{.underline}: When the HLRB\_Request\_Manager
acknowledges the activation, it sends CCBS\_Request Ack to originating
network.

[CCBS\_Reject:]{.underline} If the HLRB\_Request\_Manager does not
accept the activation attempt, it sends CCBS\_Reject to the originating
network indicating long term or short term denial.

**Relation Originating Network and HLRB\_Request**

[CCBS\_Suspend]{.underline}: If the originating network suspends a CCBS
Request, it sends CCBS\_Suspend to HLRB Request.

[CCBS\_Resume]{.underline}: When a request that was suspended is now
resumed, the originating network sends a CCBS\_Resume message to HLRB
Request.

[CCBS Cancel]{.underline}: When a request is cancelled in the
originating network, it sends a CCBS Cancel message to HLRB Request.

[Remote\_User\_Free]{.underline}: HLRB\_Request sends Remote\_User\_Free
to the originating network to inform the originating network that
destination B is now idle.

[CCBS\_Cancel]{.underline}: If a CCBS Request is cancelled in the
destination network, HLRB\_Request sends CCBS\_Cancel to the originating
network.

[TC\_END]{.underline}: If a CCBS Call is successfully delivered to
destination B, then HLRB\_Request ends the dialogue with the originating
network by sending a TC\_END message.

**Relation HLRB\_Request\_Manager and HLRB\_Request**

[Selection\_Request]{.underline}: Once destination B is idle guarded,
then the HLRB\_Request\_Manager will select the first non-suspended
request in the queue for processing by sending \"Select\_Request\" to
HLRB\_Request.

[Inactive]{.underline}: When a CCBS Request is either suspended or
unselectable due to the supplementary service interaction, HLRB\_Request
informs HLRB\_Request\_Manager so that the queue status can be updated.

[Re-Activated]{.underline}: When either a suspended CCBS Request is
resumed or the supplementary service interaction with the request ends,
then HLRB\_Request informs HLRB\_Request\_Manager so that the queue
status can be updated.

[Deleted]{.underline}: When a CCBS Request is cancelled, then
HLRB\_Request informs HLRB\_Request\_Manager so that the queue status
can be updated.

**Relation HLRB\_Recall\_Manager and HLRB\_Blocking**

[Stop\_Blocking]{.underline}: When the Recall manager process is stopped
by the Request Manager process or the Recall manager receives and
\'End\' signal from the Request manager, the Recall manager sends
\"Stop\_Blocking\" to HLRB\_Blocking.

[Recall\_Block]{.underline}: When a \"Send RUF\" signal is sent to
HLRB\_Request, the HLRB\_Recall\_Manager also sends \"Recall Block\" to
HLRB\_Blocking so that one CCBS Call can be delivered to destination B,
but other normal incoming calls are blocked.

**Relation HLRB Recall\_Manager and HLRB\_Request\_Manager**

[Select\_Request]{.underline}: On reception of a \"B\_Guarded\" signal,
the Recall manager sends \"Select\_Request\" to the Request manager. The
Request manager then selects the first non-suspended request in the
queue for processing.

[Start\_Recall\_Manager]{.underline}: When a CCBS Request is
successfully activated, the Request manager sends
\"Start\_Recall\_Manager\" to HLRB\_Recall\_Manager which subsequently
causes the recall manager process to start the monitoring process.

[Stop\_Recall\_Manager]{.underline}: The Request manager can stop the
Recall manager process by sending a \"Stop\_Recall\_Manager\" signal

[Select\_Request\_Response]{.underline}: When the Request manager has
selected a request for processing it sends a response to the recall
manager causing the recall manager to initiate a CCBS Recall.

**Relation HLRB\_Recall\_Manager and HLRB\_Request**

[Send\_RUF]{.underline}: The Recall manager requests the individual
process to send a Remote User Free indication to the originating network
by sending a \"Send\_RUF\" signal to the individual process.

[Recall\_Report]{.underline}: The Recall manager informs the individual
process of the result of processing a CCBS Recall by sending a \"Recall
Report\" signal.

[END]{.underline}: When a CCBS Request is suspended or cancelled the
HLRB\_Request process sends an \"End\" signal to the Recall Manager
process.

**Relation HLRB\_Recall\_Manager and HLRB\_Monitoring**

[Start\_Monitoring]{.underline}: When the Recall manager process is
started by the Request manager process, the Recall manager sends
\"Start\_Monitoring\" to the HLRB\_Monitoring process to request the
status of destination B

[Stop\_Monitoring]{.underline}: When the Recall manager process is
stopped by the Request manager process, the Recall manager sends
\"Stop\_Monitoring\" to the HLRB\_Monitoring process.

[B\_Query]{.underline}: HLRB\_Recall\_Manager requests the
HLRB\_monitoring process to get informed when destination B has become
idle guarded.

**Relation HLRB\_Monitoring and HLRB\_Recall\_Manager**

[B\_Guarded]{.underline}: HLRB\_Monitoring informs the
HLRB\_Recall\_Manager that destination B has become idle guarded.

[Call\_Delivery]{.underline}: HLRB\_Monitoring informs the
HLRB\_Recall\_Manager about the delivery of the CCBS call.

12 Information stored in the HLRs
=================================

Note that a given subscriber may be both the originator and the target
of CCBS requests; a given HLR may therefore be required to store both
the data for HLR A and the data for HLR B against a given subscriber.

12.1 Originating Network Data
-----------------------------

The following logical states are applicable for the CCBS service in the
originating network (refer to TS 23.011 for an explanation of the
notation):

**Provisioning State Registration State Activation State HLR Induction
State**

(Not Provisioned, Not Applicable, Not Active, Not Induced)

(Provisioned, Not Applicable, Active and Operative Not Induced)

The logical state shall be on a per subscriber basis and hence the same
for all basic service groups.

The HLR shall store the logical state of the CCBS service (which shall
be one of the valid states listed above) on a per subscriber basis. The
HLR shall store the following information for each CCBS Request that is
successfully activated by subscriber A:

\- AddressOfB;

\- Basic Service Group;

\- CCBS Call Information;

\- Translated Number;

\- Retention supported by destination network (if HLR A supports
retention);

\- CCBS Index;

\- CAMEL Invoked.

The HLR shall store for the served subscriber as the originator of CCBS
requests:

\- The parameter \"Max Queue Size\",

\- This parameter takes a value in the range 1 to 5.

12.2 Destination Network Data
-----------------------------

The following logical states are applicable for the CCBS service in the
destination network (refer to TS 23.011 for an explanation of the
notation):

**Provisioning State Registration State Activation State HLR Induction
State**

(Not Provisioned, Not Applicable, Not Active, Not Induced)

(Provisioned, Not Applicable, Active and Operative, Not Induced)

The logical state shall be on a per subscriber basis and hence the same
for all basic service groups.

The HLR shall store the logical state of the CCBS service (which shall
be one of the valid states listed above) on a per subscriber basis.

The HLR shall store the following information for each CCBS Request that
is successfully activated against User B :

\- Basic Service Group;

\- Retention supported by originating network (if HLR B supports
retention).

The HLR shall store on a per subscriber basis:

The parameter \"Number of terminating CCBS Requests\"

This parameter takes a value in the range 1 to 5.

12.3 Transfer of information from HLR to VLR
--------------------------------------------

If the provisioning state for CCBS supplementary service is
\"Provisioned\" then, when the subscriber registers on a VLR, the HLR
shall send that VLR information about the logical state of CCBS
supplementary service.

If the logical state of CCBS supplementary service is changed while a
subscriber is registered on a VLR, then the HLR shall inform the VLR of
the new logical state of CCBS supplementary service.

Both originating and destination network CCBS supplementary service
logical states are updated independently of each other to the VLR.

13 State transition model
=========================

13.1 State transition model for the CCBS service in the originating network
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Figure 13.1.1 shows the successful cases of transition between the
applicable logical states of the CCBS service in the originating
network. The state changes may be caused by actions of the service
provider or the network.

Figure 13.1.1: State Transition Model for CCBS Service in the
originating network

13.2 State transition model for the CCBS service in the destination network
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Figure 13.2.1 shows the successful cases of transition between the
applicable logical states of the CCBS service in the destination
network. The state changes may be caused by actions of the service
provider or the network.

Figure 13.2.1: State Transition Model for CCBS Service in the
destination network

13.3 State transition model for a CCBS Request
----------------------------------------------

Figure 13.3.1 shows the successful cases of transition between the
applicable logical states of a CCBS Request. The state changes may be
caused by actions of the served subscriber or the network.

Each subscriber can be considered to have a set of n requests, where n
is the maximum number of CCBS requests allowed for a subscriber as an
originator.

Figure 13.3.1: State Transition Model for a CCBS Request in Originating
Network

On provision of the CCBS service, all requests transit to the \"Start\"
state

Figure 13.3.2: State Transition Model for a CCBS Request in Destination
Network

13.4 Information stored in the VLRs
-----------------------------------

**Originating Network Data**

For the CCBS service in the originating network the VLR shall store the
service state information received from HLR.

**Destination Network Data**

For the CCBS service in the destination network the VLR shall store the
service state information received from HLR.

######## Annex A (informative): Message flow diagrams showing a successful CCBS request

The following message flow diagrams show a successful CCBS request.
Destination B busy when request activated, subscriber A free when
destination B becomes free (mobile-to-mobile).
