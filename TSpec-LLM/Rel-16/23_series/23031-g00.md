1 Scope
=======

This Technical Specification specifies the stage 2 description of the
Fraud Information Gathering System (FIGS) feature which provides the
means for the HPLMN to monitor the activities of its subscribers in a
VPLMN.

Three levels of FIGS service are defined, levels 1 to 3.

Level 1 will use the facilities provided by Transferred Account
Procedure (TAP).

Levels 2 and 3 will use facilities provided by Customised Applications
for Mobile network Enhanced Logic (CAMEL), in particular, the
information flows between the GSM Service Switching Function (gsmSSF)
and GSM Service Control Function (gsmSCF). Phase 1 and Phase 2 CAMEL
facilities will be used.

Connection-orientated services only are covered.

3 Definitions and abbreviations
===============================

3.1 Definitions
---------------

For the purposes of this specification the following definitions apply:

**A subscriber:** The calling mobile subscriber.

**B subscriber:** The mobile subscriber originally called by the A
subscriber.

**C subscriber:** The subscriber to whom the B subscriber has requested
that calls be forwarded. The C subscriber may be fixed or mobile.

**call**: connection-oriented service/event.

**GSM Service Control Function (gsmSCF):** A functional entity that
contains the CAMEL service logic to implement OSS. It interfaces with
the gsmSSF and the HLR.

**GSM Service Switching Function (gsmSSF):** A functional entity that
interfaces the MSC/GMSC to the gsmSCF. The concept of the gsmSSF is
derived from the IN gsmSSF, but uses different triggering mechanisms
because of the nature of the mobile network.

**Originating CAMEL Subscription Information (O-CSI):** The O-CSI
identifies the subscriber as having originating CAMEL services.

**Supplementary Service Notification CAMEL Subscription Information
(SS-CSI)**: The SS-CSI identifies the subscriber as having supplementary
service invocation notification CAMEL services.

**Terminating CAMEL Subscription Information (T-CSI):** The T-CSI
identifies the subscriber as having terminating CAMEL services.

**VMSC**: The serving MSC in the VPLMN.

4 FIGS Monitoring Levels
========================

There are three levels of monitoring of subscriber activities using
FIGS.

Level 1 an accelerated TAP procedure associated with a mechanism such as
Hot Billing is implemented in the MSC of the VPLMN.

Level 2 CAMEL is used to gather information, but only at the beginning
and the end of the call.

Level 3 CAMEL provides full information on subscriber activities, as
defined in 3GPP TS 42.031, i.e. call start and end times, and partial
call records. Notification of the invocation of Explicit Call Transfer,
Call Deflection, Call Forwarding, Call Hold and Multi Party Service is
also given.

5 FIGS Level 1: Accelerated TAP Records
=======================================

5.1 Method of FIGS Setting
--------------------------

A PLMN shall request that a VPLMN monitor a designated subscriber using
FIGS level 1 by setting a Hot Billing flag in the subscriber data stored
in the HLR of the HPLMN. This data is drawn down by the VPLMN when the
subscriber first registers in the VPLMN.

If the HPLMN wishes to begin monitoring of a subscriber using FIGS Level
1 when the subscriber is already registered in the VPLMN, it resets the
subscriber data in the VPLMN using command *Insert Subscriber Data*.

5.2 Information Flows
---------------------

If a subscriber in a VPLMN is set in the subscriber categories to be
monitored using FIGS Level 1 the VMSC shall process and return the TAP
records for that subscriber in accordance with the guidelines given in
current and future version of TAP.

6 FIGS and CAMEL Architecture for FIGS Levels 2 and 3
=====================================================

FIGS provides the following information flows to the HPLMN, with respect
to roaming subscribers monitored by FIGS Levels 2 and 3.

**FIGS Level 2:**

> **call start and end times** (both MO, MT and forwarded calls). (At
> CAMEL Phase 1 the gsmSSF will not put a timestamp on messages. The
> arrival times of messages at the gsmSCF will be used for call start
> and end times.)

**FIGS Level 3:**

As for level 2 with the addition of:

**partial call information** (accumulated duration of call still in
progress) (CAMEL Phase only);

**notification of the invocation of ECT, CD and MPTY, CF and call hold**
(CAMEL Phase 2 only).

Further phases of CAMEL will provide the functionality to check the IMEI
of the ME used by a CAMEL subscriber. Other information required by
3GPP TS 42.031, annex A, that is not provided by CAMEL Phase 1 and CAMEL
Phase 2, may also be provided by further phases of CAMEL.

The architecture of the services provided by FIGS Levels 2 and 3 is
given in the diagrams below. Thick lines indicate possible CAMEL
monitoring/control relationships.

Figure 1: FIGS architecture for MO call

Figure 2: FIGS Architecture for MT/forwarded call

Early call forwarding can be performed if the subscriber has set
Unconditional Call Forward or the HLR has determined, before the call is
extended to VPLMN B, that the B subscriber is not reachable. In all
other cases the call must be extended to the VMSC.

The information flows required by FIGS levels 2 and 3 can be provided by
the information flows on the CAP interfaces between the gsmSCF and the
gsmSSF in the interrogating and visiting networks.

The interface between the gsmSCF and the Fraud Detection System (FDS) is
non-standard.

7 FIGS Levels 2 and 3
=====================

7.1 Method of FIGS Setting
--------------------------

A PLMN shall request that a VPLMN monitor a designated subscriber using
FIGS levels 2 or 3 by setting the O-CSI, T-CSI and SS-CSI (level 3 only)
flags in the subscriber data stored in the HLR of the HPLMN. This data
is drawn down by the VPLMN when the subscriber first registers in the
VPLMN.

If the HPLMN wishes to begin monitoring of a subscriber using FIGS Level
2 or 3 when the subscriber is already registered in the VPLMN, it resets
the subscriber data in the VPLMN using command *Insert Subscriber Data*.

7.2 Information Flows
---------------------

FIGS Levels 2 and 3 will be treated together in this section but it
should be remembered that partial call records and SS notification
invocation is not available with FIGS Level 2.

Each item of call data required by FIGS will be considered in turn and
the information flows within CAMEL which provide this data given.

Text applies to the implementation of FIGS functionality using both
Phases 1 and 2, unless otherwise stated.

MO and MT calls will be treated together. If a message or DP is named as
*O/T\_Answer*, for instance, this means that if the call is MO, the
relevant DP is *O\_answer*, and that if the call is MT, the relevant DP
is *T\_answer*.

Diagrams showing the information flows for FIGS levels 2 and 3 are given
in Annex A.

### 7.2.1 Mobile Originated and Mobile Terminated Calls

#### 7.2.1.1 Call Start Time

Information regarding a call attempt can be obtained from the
*InitialDP* message sent from the gsmSSF to the gsmSCF. This message is
sent after a control relationship for the call has been set up between
the gsmSSF and gsmSCF. This message will provide notification to the FDS
that a FIGS monitored subscriber has made a call **attempt**, or that an
attempt is being made to call a FIGS monitored subscriber.

**CAMEL Phase 1**

The call, however, has not been connected at the time of the *InitialDP*
message. The gsmSCF must therefore arm DP *O/T\_answer*, so that the
gsmSSF will inform the gsmSCF when the called party answers/connects.
The gsmSCF arms the DP with message *Request\_Report\_BCSM\_Event* sent
to the gsmSSF.

**If the called party answers**, the gsmSSF sends *Event\_Report\_BCSM
(Notify and Continue)* to gsmSCF. This message provides notification to
the FDS that the attempted call has begun. The gsmSCF must then arm DP
*O/T\_Disconnect*, so that the gsmSSF will notify the gsmSCF when the
call ends.

**If the called party does not answer**, the gsmSSF terminates the
relationship for the call with the gsmSCF. It does this using message
*"ABORT*". This message provides notification to the FDS that the call
attempted did not connect.

**CAMEL Phase 2**

The call, however, has not been connected at the time of the *InitialDP*
message. The gsmSCF must therefore arm DP *O/T\_Answer*, so that the
gsmSSF will inform the gsmSCF when the called party answers/connects.
The following DP's (with trigger events given) must also be armed so
that the gsmSCF will be informed if the trigger event occurs:

*O\_Route\_Select\_Failure* (call establishment fails, MO calls only)

*O/T\_Busy* (called party is busy)

*O/T\_No\_Answer* (no answer from called party)

*O/T\_Abandon* (calling party abandons the call before the called party
has answered)

*O/T\_Not\_Reachable* (called party is not reachable)

For the purposes of FIGS, these DP's need only be armed for notification
(N).

The gsmSCF arms all these DPs with a single message
*Request\_Report\_BCSM\_Event*, sent to the gsmSSF.

**If the trigger event** for any of *O\_Route\_Select\_Failure,
O/T\_Busy, O/T\_No\_Answer, O/T\_Not\_Reachable* occurs then the gsmSCF
is informed by the gsmSSF of the failure of the call attempt with
*Event\_Report\_BCSM*, enclosing the relevant cause.

**If the called party answers**, the gsmSSF sends message
*Event\_Report\_BCSM* to the gsmSCF. This message provides notification
to the FDS of the start of a call by a FIGS monitored subscriber. The
gsmSCF must then arm DP *O/T\_Disconnect*, so that the gsmSSF will
notify the gsmSCF when the call ends.

#### 7.2.1.2 Partial Call Records

This functionality is available with CAMEL Phase 2 only.

Using the "Apply Charging" process within CAMEL Phase 2, the gsmSCF can
control the duration of a call. The gsmSCF authorises the gsmSSF to
allow the call to proceed continue for a certain time. At the conclusion
of this time period, the gsmSSF seeks further instructions from the
gsmSCF. The gsmSCF can, at this point, authorise the call to continue
for another time period (which may be different to the first) or may
instruct the gsmSSF to terminate the call.

With regard to FIGS, this functionality can be used to generate
**partial call records** for the gsmSCF, as follows:

After the gsmSCF has received the *InitialDP* message from the gsmSSF,
the gsmSCF sends message *Apply\_Charging* to the gsmSSF, containing
parameter "Tcs", the "call segment" duration. The gsmSSF will then send
message *Apply\_Charging\_Report* to the gsmSCF after *Tcs* seconds.
This message c

ontains the duration of the call since the start of charging The gsmSCF
may then instruct the gsmSSF to allow the call to continue for another
*Tcs* seconds and this sequence of events continues until the call is
released. When the call is released, *Apply\_Charging\_Report* is sent
to the gsmSCF.

The gsmSCF can therefore define how often it is to receive partial call
records on a per subscriber, per call basis, and can change how often
the partial call records are received during a call

#### 7.2.1.3 Call End Time

When either of the calling or called parties releases the call, the
*O/T-Disconnect* DP is triggered and message *Event\_Report\_BCSM* is
sent to the gsmSCF. This message provides notification to the FDS of the
call end.

### 7.2.2 Forwarded Call

#### 7.2.2.1 Call Start Time

The forwarded leg "from" the called party to the forwarded‑to number is
considered as an MO call, originated by the called subscriber, as well
as an MT call for the called subscriber. Two separate CAMEL dialogues
will therefore be set up.

The CAMEL process for the terminating leg will follow subclause 7.1 as
an MT call and the CAMEL process for the "originating" (forwarded) leg
will follow subclause 7.1 as an MO call.

#### 7.2.2.2 Partial Call Records

As for subclause 7.1.2.

#### 7.2.2.3 Call End Time 

As for subclause 7.1.3.

### 7.2.3 Supplementary Service Invocation

This functionality is available with CAMEL Phase 2 only.

From CAMEL Phase 2 (GSM 03.78 Release 97), subclause 8.11:

\"At the invocation of any of the services ECT, CD and MPTY the MSC/VLR
checks whether the criteria for sending a notification is fulfilled,
i.e. whether the subscriber is provisioned with the SS-CSI and the
particular invoked supplementary service is marked in the SS-CSI. If
this is the case a notification is sent to the gsmSCF given by the
gsmSCF address contained in the SS-CSI. The processing of the particular
SS invocation is not suspended. If the notification criteria is not
fulfilled the processing of the particular supplementary service
continues unchanged and no notification is sent.

The sending of the notification is independent of call related CAMEL
processing, i.e. processing indicated by O/T-CSI.\"

######## Annex A (informative): FIGS Data provided by CAMEL Messages

GSM 02.33 lists the information that should be present in FIGS Data
messages. Tables A.1 to A.3 show the information required by GSM 02.33
for call start and end and partial call records, and the CAMEL messages,
if any, that provide this information. Note that partial call records
are only available with FIGS Level 3.

The CAMEL message given for a particular call event, e.g. call end, will
not necessarily arrive at that event. The FDS must have the ability to
build up a full picture of a call as various CAMEL messages are
received.

**Dialed digits:** This always gives (for MO calls) the number
originally entered by the party making the call, including any
non-numeric characters.

**Modified B/C party number:** As the number is modified by the gsmSCF
itself, it is assumed that the FDS will have direct access to this field
and need not scan outgoing messages from the gsmSCF to obtain the field.
If, however, the FDS must scan outgoing messages, the field is given in
field Destination Routing Address in message Connect.

Cell Global Identifier **(CGI)**: refers to the cell used by the MS at
the start of the call.

The CAMEL message for SS invocation notification have not yet been
defined so the call information for SS invocation notification can only
be specified in general terms.

The notification of supplementary service (SS) invocation will be the
same as table A.3, except that information field "Type of Service" will
be "Type of SS", and "Call Duration" will be "Time of SS invocation".
"Type of SS" will be given in the invocation notification sent from the
gsmSSF to the gsmSCF. "Time of SS invocation" will be the timestamp in
the invocation notification or its time of arrival at the gsmSCF.
