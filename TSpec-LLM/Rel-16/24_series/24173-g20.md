4 Overview of multimedia telephony communication service and associated supplementary services in the IP Multimedia (IM) Core Network (CN) subsystem
====================================================================================================================================================

4.1 General
-----------

In accordance with the service definition and requirements in
3GPP TS 22.173 \[2\], the IMS multimedia telephony communication service
specified herein allows multimedia conversational communication between
two or more end points. An end point is typically located in a UE, but
can also be located in a network entity.

As for traditional circuit-switched telephony, the protocols for the IMS
multimedia Telephony communication service allow a user to connect to
any other user, regardless of operator and access technology.

The IMS multimedia Telephony communication service consists of two
principal parts: a basic communication part, and an optional
supplementary services part.

4.1A Roles
----------

### 4.1A.1 Multimedia telephony participant

A UE shall implement the role of a multimedia telephony participant.

### 4.1A.2 Multimedia telephony application server

An application server shall implement the role of a multimedia telephony
application server. Various application server usages are called out by
references to the various supplementary services, see subclause 4.3. It
is an implementation decision on how to allocate the functionality to
one or more application servers.

4.2 Overview of basic communication part
----------------------------------------

The basic communication part of an IMS multimedia telephony
communication service session is realised by a single SIP session. It
utilises media capabilities and flexibility provided by the SIP protocol
and the 3GPP IMS specifications. In accordance with the service
definition in 3GPP TS 22.173 \[2\], media capabilities include RTP-based
transfer of voice, real-time video, real-time text and data, and
UDPTL-based transfer of fax (IETF RFC 3362 \[28\]), as well as
TCP/MSRP-based transfer of text, arbitrary files and sharing of media
files with predefined formats.

To ensure interoperability, media handling (including codecs and
formats) is fully specified for RTP-based and MSRP-based transfer in:

\- 3GPP TS 26.114 \[12\] for 3GPP systems;

\- 3GPP2 C.S0055-A \[21\] for 3GPP2 systems; and

\- ETSI TS 181 005 \[22\] (codecs) and 3GPP TS 26.114 \[12\] (formats
and other media handling) for fixed-broadband accesses.

The service is highly dynamic in terms of media component usage: the
protocols allow a communication session to start with one or more media
components, and components can then be added and/or removed during the
communication session. The protocols allow both one-way and two ways
transfer between end points. Full duplex speech, and speech combined
with other media components, are typical media cases but the protocols
do not mandate the use of speech in all sessions.

4.3 Overview of supplementary services part
-------------------------------------------

The supplementary services part of the IMS multimedia telephony
communication service consists of a number of specified supplementary
services. These are fully standardized to ensure interoperability
between multiple end points, and between end points and network control
entities. The behaviour of supplementary services is similar to
supplementary services specified for CS speech (TS 11). Supplementary
services uses SIP as enabling protocol. Configuration of supplementary
services by the user should:

\- take place over the Ut interface using XCAP as enabling protocol as
described in 3GPP TS 24.623 \[11\]; or

\- use SIP based user configuration as described in
3GPP TS 24.238 \[20\] ;

NOTE: Other possibilities for user configuration, such as web-based
provisioning or pre-provisioning by the operator are outside the scope
of the present document, but are not precluded.

The \"SS\_domain\_setting\" leaf in 3GPP TS 24.167 \[32\] provides a
mechanism to:

a\) instruct the UE to only use the PS domain for SS setting control;

b\) instruct the UE to only use the CS domain for SS setting control; or

c\) instruct the UE to use the PS domain for SS setting control when the
PS domain is being used by the UE for voice services, and to use the CS
domain for SS setting control when the CS domain is being used by the UE
for voice services.

If one of the restrictions described in the bullets a) or c) applies,
then the \"PS\_domain\_IMS\_SS\_control\_preference\" leaf in
3GPP TS 24.167 \[32\] provides a mechanism to:

\- restrict the UE to use the Ut interface with XCAP as enabling
protocol as described in 3GPP TS 24.623 \[11\]; or

\- restrict the UE to use SIP based user configuration as described in
3GPP TS 24.238 \[20\].

5 Basic Communication
=====================

5.1 IMS communication service identifier
----------------------------------------

URN used to define the ICSI for the IMS Multimedia Telephony
Communication Service: urn:urn-7:3gpp-service.ims.icsi.mmtel. The URN is
registered at http://www.3gpp.com/Uniform-Resource-Name-URN-list.html.

Summary of the URN: This URN indicates that the device supports the IMS
Multimedia Telephony Communication Service.

The URN is intended primarily for use in the following applications,
protocols, services, or negotiation mechanisms:

This URN is most useful in a communications application, for describing
the capabilities of a device, such as a phone or PDA.

Examples of typical use: Indicating that a mobile phone can support the
IMS Multimedia Telephony Communication Service.

> Supplementary Services, stage 3\"

5.2 Session control procedures
------------------------------

The IMS multimedia telephony communication service can support different
types of media, including media types listed in 3GPP TS 22.173 \[2\].
The session control procedures for the different media types shall be in
accordance with 3GPP TS 24.229 \[13\] and 3GPP TS 24.247 \[14\], with
the following additions:

a\) Multimedia telephony is an IMS communication service and the
P-Preferred-Service and P-Asserted-Service headers shall be treated as
described in 3GPP TS 24.229 \[13\]. The coding of the ICSI value in the
P-Preferred-Service and P-Asserted-Service headers shall be according to
subclause 5.1.

b\) The multimedia telephony participant shall include the \"+g.3gpp.
icsi-ref\" header field parameter equal to the ICSI value defined in
subclause 5.1 in the Contact header field in initial requests and
responses as described in 3GPP TS 24.229 \[13\].

c\) The multimedia telephony participant shall include an Accept-Contact
header field containing the \"+g.3gpp.icsi-ref\" header field parameter
containing the ICSI value defined in subclause 5.1 in initial requests.
If the user requests capabilities other than multimedia telephony, the
Accept-Contact header field may contain other feature parameters and
feature parameter values, and other Accept-Contact header fields may be
added to express user preferences as per IETF RFC 3841 \[16\].

NOTE 1: How the user indicates other feature parameters and the feature
parameter values is outside of the scope of this document.

d\) The multimedia telephony application server shall include the
\"+g.3gpp.icsi-ref\" header field parameter equal to the ICSI value
defined in subclause 5.1 in a Feature-Caps header field in requests sent
to the terminating user and in 1xx or 2xx responses to requests from the
originating user as described in 3GPP TS 24.229 \[13\] and
IETF RFC 6809 \[31\].

e\) The multimedia telephony participant may use the presence of a
\"+g.3gpp.icsi-ref\" header field parameter equal to the ICSI value
defined in subclause 5.1 in a Feature-Caps header field in requests and
responses as described in IETF RFC 6809 \[31\] to determine that a
multimedia telephony application server is participating in the session
and multimedia telephony is the IMS communication service supported for
use in the dialog.

NOTE 2: ICSI values with subclass identifiers are considered equal to
the value defined in subclause 5.1 when determining that the multimedia
telephony application server is participating in the session.

f\) The multimedia telephony application server may insert a
Response-Source header field in accordance with the procedures in
subclause 5.7.1.0 of 3GPP TS 24.229 \[13\], where the \"role\" header
field parameter is set to \"tas\" when initiating a failure response to
any received request.

5.3 Interworking
----------------

The multimedia telephony participant could receive initial requests that
do not contain the ICSI value defined in subclause 5.1 in the
Accept-Contact header but still invoke the IMS multimedia telephony
communication service application.

5.4 Call progress indications
-----------------------------

The UE shall support the UE procedures specified in
3GPP TS 24.628 \[35\].

J.1 Scope
=========

The present annex defines IP-CAN specific requirements for a multimedia
telephony communication service and associated supplementary services in
the IP Multimedia (IM) Core Network (CN) subsystem, where the IP-CAN is
Evolved Packet System (EPS).

J.2 EPS aspects when connected to the IM CN subsystem
=====================================================

J.2.1 Procedures at the UE
--------------------------

### J.2.1.1 Service Specific Access Control

The following information is provided by lower layer:

\- BarringFactorForMMTEL-Voice: barring rate for MMTEL voice;

\- BarringTimeForMMTEL-Voice: barring timer for MMTEL voice;

\- BarringFactorForMMTEL-Video: barring rate for MMTEL video; and

\- BarringTimeForMMTEL-Video: barring timer for MMTEL video.

Upon request from a user to establish a multimedia telephony
communication session as described in subclause 5.2, the UE shall:

1\) if the multimedia telephony communication session to be established
is an emergency session, then skip the rest of steps below and continue
with session establishment as described in subclause 5.2;

2\) retrieve SSAC related information mentioned above from lower layers;

NOTE 1: The values of SSAC related information retrieved from lower
layers can depend on whether the UE has an Access Class with a value in
the range 11..15 or not. Determination of the values of the SSAC related
information is described in subclause 5.3.3.10 of 3GPP TS 36.331 \[26\].

3\) if video is offered in the multimedia telephony communication
session:

A\) if back-off timer Tx is running, reject the multimedia telephony
communication session establishment and skip the rest of steps below; or

B\) else, then:

I\) draw a new random number \"rand1\" that is uniformly distributed in
the range 0 ≤ rand1 \< 1; and

II\) if the random number \"rand1\" is lower than
BarringFactorForMMTEL-Video, then skip the rest of steps below and
continue with session establishment as described in subclause 5.2;

NOTE 2: If the BarringFactorForMMTEL-Video is set to 1, the session is
exempted from barring.

III\) else, then;

i\) draw a new random number \"rand2\" that is uniformly distributed in
the range 0 ≤ rand2 \< 1; and

ii\) start back-off timer Tx with the timer value calculated using the
formula:

Tx = (0,7 + 0,6\*rand2) \* BarringTimeForMMTEL-Video; and

iii\) reject the multimedia telephony communication session
establishment and skip the rest of steps below;

4\) if audio is offered in the multimedia telephony communication
session:

A\) if back-off timer Ty is running, reject the multimedia telephony
communication session establishment and skip the rest of steps below; or

B\) else, then;

I\) draw a new random number \"rand3\" that is uniformly distributed in
the range 0 ≤ rand3 \< 1; and

II\) if the random number \"rand3\" is lower than
BarringFactorForMMTEL-Voice, then skip the rest of steps below and
continue with session establishment as described in subclause 5.2;

NOTE 3: If the BarringFactorForMMTEL-Voice is set to 1, the session is
exempted from barring.

III\) else, then;

i\) draw a new random number \"rand4\" that is uniformly distributed in
the range 0 ≤ rand4 \< 1; and

ii\) start timer Ty with the timer value calculated using the fomula:

Ty = (0,7 + 0,6\*rand4) \* BarringTimeForMMTEL-Voice; and

iii\) reject the multimedia telephony communication session
establishment;

NOTE 4: If the multimedia telephony communication implemenation and the
access stratum protocol implementation are located in separate physical
entities, it is expected that the interconnecting protocol supports the
transfer of information elements needed for the service specific access
control enforcement.

Service Specific Access Control is not activated when the UE is in other
radio accesses (e.g. UTRAN/GERAN). And when UE camping on E-UTRAN moves
to other radio accesses (e.g. UTRAN/GERAN), back-off timer (Tx or Ty or
both) shall be stopped if running.

### J.2.1.2 Smart Congestion Mitigation

The following information is provided to the non-access stratum:

\- MO-MMTEL-voice-started;

\- MO-MMTEL-voice-ended.

\- MO-MMTEL-video-started; and

\- MO-MMTEL-video-ended;

Upon request from a user to establish an originating multimedia
telephony communication session as described in subclause 5.2, and if
the session establishment is continued after performing the Service
Specific Access Control as specified in subclause J.2.1.1:

1\) if only audio or only real-time text or only both audio and
real-time text (see subclause 4.2 for 3GPP systems) are offered in the
multimedia telephony communication session, and no other originating
multimedia telephony communication session initiated with offering only
audio or only real-time text or only both audio and real-time
textexists, the UE sends the MO-MMTEL-voice-started indication to the
non-access stratum and continue with session establishment as described
in subclause 5.2;

2\) if video is offered in the multimedia telephony communication
session, and no other originating multimedia telephony communication
session initiated with offering video exists, the UE sends the
MO-MMTEL-video-started indication to the non-access stratum and continue
with session establishment as described in subclause 5.2.

When an originating multimedia telephony communication session ends
(i.e. a response to a BYE or a failure response to the initial INVITE
request is transferred), the originating multimedia telephony
communication session was initiated with offering only audio or only
real-time text or only both audio and real-time text (i.e. in the SDP
offer in the initial INVITE request), and no other originating
multimedia telephony communication session initiated with offering only
audio or only real-time text or only both audio and real-time text
exists, the UE sends the MO-MMTEL-voice-ended to the non-access stratum.

When an originating multimedia telephony communication session ends
(i.e. a response to a BYE or a failure response to the initial INVITE
request is transferred), the originating multimedia telephony
communication session was initiated with offering video (i.e. in the SDP
offer in the initial INVITE request), and no other originating
multimedia telephony communication session initiated with offering video
exists, the UE sends the MO-MMTEL-video-ended indication to the
non-access stratum.

NOTE 1: If the UE supports other 3GPP specific mechanisms for
communicating with the non-access stratum protocol implementation, e.g.
DHCP discovery via PCO, then the UE is expected to support the transfer
of information elements needed for the smart congestion mitigation
enforcement.

NOTE 2: Adding or removing media during the multimedia telephony
communication session has no impact on the information relating to smart
congestion mitigation.

### J.2.1.3 MMTEL request timeouts

If the UE supports timer RequestTimeout, then upon a request from a user
to establish an originating multimedia telephony communication session
as described in subclause 5.2, the UE shall start timer RequestTimeout
when sending an initial INVITE request.

The UE may support being configured for the RequestTimeout timer with
the operator\'s IMS multimedia telephony communication service policy as
specified in 3GPP TS 24.275 \[36\].

### J.2.1.4 Abnormal cases

Upon request from a user to establish a MMTEL voice session as described
in subclause 5.2, if:

a\) the UE receives, from the lower layers, a notification that the
service request:

1\) was not accepted due to congestion; or

2\) resulted in starting timer T3325 (see 3GPP TS 24.008 \[80\]); and

b\) an originating initial INVITE transaction, for which a 2xx response
has not yet been received, exists;

then:

a\) if a provisional response has been received, the UE shall cancel
INVITE transaction; and

b\) if an alternative radio access network is available:

1\) if the service request was not accepted due to congestion, the UE
shall attempt the MMTEL voice session on the alternative radio access
network; or

2\) if the service request resulted in starting timer T3325, the UE
should attempt the MMTEL voice session on the alternative radio access
network.

J.3 Application usage of SIP
============================

J.3.1 Procedures at the UE
--------------------------

### J.3.1.1 3GPP PS data off

#### J.3.1.1.1 General

exempt service, one indication is valid for the UE camping in the HPLMN
or the EHPLMN, and the other indication is valid for any VPLMN the UE is
roaming in; and

2\) up to two indications whether the MMTEL video is a 3GPP PS data off
exempt service, one indication is valid for the UE camping in the HPLMN
or the EHPLMN, and the other indication is valid for any VPLMN the UE is
roaming in;

b\) the UE may support being configured with the indication whether the
MMTEL voice is a 3GPP PS data off exempt service using one or more of
the following methods:

3GPP TS 24.275 \[36\] and the EF~3GPPPSDATAOFF~ described in
3GPP TS 31.102 \[38\], then the EF~3GPPPSDATAOFF~ shall take precedence;

If the UE is configured with both the MMTEL\_video\_roaming\_exempt node
of 3GPP TS 24.275 \[36\] and the EF~3GPPPSDATAOFF~ described in
3GPP TS 31.102 \[38\], then the EF~3GPPPSDATAOFF~ shall take precedence.

When the UE is only configured with the indication valid for the UE
camping in the HPLMN or the EHPLMN, the UE shall use this indication
also when the UE is in the VPLMN.

#### J.3.1.1.2 Enforcement

If the 3GPP PS data off status is \"active\":

a\) the UE shall release according to 3GPP TS 24.229 \[13\] any

IP-CAN bearer and with:

A\) an SDP offer; or

B\) an SDP answer;

with only audio, only real-time text or only audio and real-time text;

NOTE 3: If the UE doesn\'t send an intitial SIP INVITE due to conditions
as described in bullet c.2, the UE can attempt a request for a service
equivalent to MMTel voice via the CS domain -- if supported and
available -- and, otherwise, the UE can attempt the service according to
3GPP TS 24.229 \[13\] and as described in subclause 5.2 via non-3GPP
access.

d\) if the UE is not configured with indication that MMTEL video is a
3GPP PS data off exempt service:

1\) the UE shall release according to 3GPP TS 24.229 \[13\] any

according to 3GPP TS 24.229 \[13\].

NOTE 4: Which of the bullets 1), 2), and 3) the UE performs is
influenced by other 3GPP PS data off exempt services.

J.3.2 Procedures at the multimedia telephony application server
---------------------------------------------------------------

### J.3.2.1 3GPP PS data off

A multimedia telephony application server supporting the 3GPP PS data
off can be configured with:

1\) up to two indications whether the MMTEL voice is a 3GPP PS data off
exempt service, one indication is valid for the UE camping in the HPLMN
or the EHPLMN, and the other indication is valid for any VPLMN the UE is
roaming in; and

2\) up to two indications whether the MMTEL video is a 3GPP PS data off
exempt service, one indication is valid for the UE camping in the HPLMN
or the EHPLMN, and the other indication is valid for any VPLMN the UE is
roaming in.

When the multimedia telephony application server is only configured with
the indication valid for the UE camping in the HPLMN or the EHPLMN, the
multimedia telephony application server shall use this indication also
when the UE is in the VPLMN.

If the multimedia telephony application server supports the 3GPP PS data
off, the multimedia telephony application server shall support obtaining
registration state information from a received third-party SIP REGISTER
request including information contained in the body of the third-party
SIP REGISTER request as specified in 3GPP TS 24.229 \[13\], of the
served UE.

If a received registration state information of the served UE indicates
a Contact header field with the g.3gpp.ps-data-off media feature tag
with the \"active\" value:

a\) the multimedia telephony application server shall not send according
to 3GPP TS 24.229 \[13\] a SIP message related to a multimedia telephony
communication session as described in subclause 5.2 with:

1\) an SDP offer; or

2\) an SDP answer;

containing media streams:

1\) other than only audio;

2\) other than only real-time text;

3\) other than only audio and real-time text; and

4\) not including video;

towards a contact address (or via a registration flow) of the served UE
such that the contact address (or the registration flow) was registered
or re-registered by a SIP REGISTER request with a P-Access-Network-Info
header field with \"3GPP-GERAN\", \"3GPP-UTRAN\", \"3GPP-E-UTRAN\" or
\"3GPP-NR\" access class, and with the \"network-provided\" header field
parameter;

b\) if the multimedia telephony application server is not configured
with indication that MMTEL voice is a 3GPP PS data off exempt service
for the served UE, the multimedia telephony application server shall not
send according to 3GPP TS 24.229 \[13\] a SIP message related to the IMS
multimedia telephony communication service with:

1\) an SDP offer; or

2\) an SDP answer;

containing media streams:

1\) with only audio;

2\) with only real-time text; or

3\) with only audio and real-time text;

towards a contact address (or via a registration flow) of the served UE
such that the contact address (or the registration flow) was registered
or re-registered by a SIP REGISTER request with a P-Access-Network-Info
header field with \"3GPP-GERAN\", \"3GPP-UTRAN\", \"3GPP-E-UTRAN\" or
\"3GPP-NR\" access class, and with the \"network-provided\" header field
parameter; and

c\) if the multimedia telephony application server is not configured
with indication that MMTEL video is a 3GPP PS data off exempt service
for the served UE, the multimedia telephony application server shall not
send according to 3GPP TS 24.229 \[13\] a SIP message related to a
multimedia telephony communication session as described in
subclause 5.2, with:

1\) an SDP offer; or

2\) an SDP answer;

containing media streams with video towards a contact address (or via a
registration flow) of the served UE such that the contact address (or
the registration flow) was registered or re-registered by a SIP REGISTER
request with a P-Access-Network-Info header field with \"3GPP-GERAN\",
\"3GPP-UTRAN\", \"3GPP-E-UTRAN\" or \"3GPP-NR\" access class, and with
the \"network-provided\" header field parameter.

######## Annex K (normative): IP-Connectivity Access Network specific concepts when using GPRS to access IM CN subsystem

K.1 Scope
=========

The UE may support the present annex.

The present annex defines IP-CAN specific requirements for a multimedia
telephony communication service and associated supplementary services in
the IP Multimedia (IM) Core Network (CN) subsystem, where the IP-CAN is
General Packet Radio Service (GPRS).

K.2 GPRS (Iu mode only) aspects when connected to the IM CN subsystem
=====================================================================

K.2.1 Procedures at the UE
--------------------------

### K.2.1.1 General

The UE may support any of the procedures of subclause K.2.1.

### K.2.1.2 Application specific Congestion control for Data Communication (ACDC) procedure

The following information is provided to the non-access stratum:

\- MO-MMTEL-voice-started;

\- MO-MMTEL-voice-ended.

\- MO-MMTEL-video-started; and

\- MO-MMTEL-video-ended;

Upon request from a user to establish an originating multimedia
telephony communication session as described in subclause 5.2:

1\) if only audio or only real-time text or only both audio and
real-time text (see subclause 4.2 for 3GPP systems) are offered in the
multimedia telephony communication session, and no other originating
multimedia telephony communication session initiated with offering only
audio or only real-time text or only both audio and real-time
textexists, the UE sends the MO-MMTEL-voice-started indication to the
non-access stratum and continue with session establishment as described
in subclause 5.2;

2\) if video is offered in the multimedia telephony communication
session, and no other originating multimedia telephony communication
session initiated with offering video exists, the UE sends the
MO-MMTEL-video-started indication to the non-access stratum and continue
with session establishment as described in subclause 5.2.

When an originating multimedia telephony communication session ends
(i.e. a response to a BYE or a failure response to the initial INVITE
request is transferred), the originating multimedia telephony
communication session was initiated with offering only audio or only
real-time text or only both audio and real-time text (i.e. in the SDP
offer in the initial INVITE request), and no other originating
multimedia telephony communication session initiated with offering only
audio or only real-time text or only both audio and real-time text
exists, the UE sends the MO-MMTEL-voice-ended to the non-access stratum.

When an originating multimedia telephony communication session ends
(i.e. a response to a BYE or a failure response to the initial INVITE
request is transferred), the originating multimedia telephony
communication session was initiated with offering video (i.e. in the SDP
offer in the initial INVITE request), and no other originating
multimedia telephony communication session initiated with offering video
exists, the UE sends the MO-MMTEL-video-ended indication to the
non-access stratum.

NOTE 1: If the UE supports other 3GPP specific mechanisms for
communicating with the non-access stratum protocol implementation, e.g.
DHCP discovery via PCO, then the UE is expected to support the transfer
of information elements needed for the application specific congestion
control for data communication enforcement.

NOTE 2: Adding or removing media during the multimedia telephony
communication session has no impact on the information relating to
application specific congestion control for data communication.

2\) other than only real-time text;

3\) other than only audio and real-time text; and

4\) not including video;

NOTE 2: When the 3GPP PS data off status is \"active\", an MMTEL session
which is not MMTEL voice and which is not MMTEL video (e.g. MMTEL
session with only fax) cannot be initiated.

c\) if the UE is not configured with indication that MMTEL voice is a
3GPP PS data off exempt service:

1\) the UE shall release according to 3GPP TS 24.229 \[13\] any
multimedia telephony communication session as described in
subclause 5.2, which is not an IMS emergency call, established with a
UE\'s contact address containing an IP address associated with a GPRS
IP-CAN bearer, and with only audio, only real-time text or only audio
and real-time text; and

2\) the UE shall not send according to 3GPP TS 24.229 \[13\] a SIP
message related to a multimedia telephony communication session as
described in subclause 5.2, which is not an IMS emergency call, from a
UE\'s contact address containing an IP address associated with a GPRS
IP-CAN bearer and with:

A\) an SDP offer; or

B\) an SDP answer;

with only audio, only real-time text or only audio and real-time text;

NOTE 3: If the UE doesn\'t send an intitial SIP INVITE due to conditions
as described in bullet c.2, the UE can attempt a request for a service
equivalent to MMTel voice via the CS domain -- if supported and
available -- and, otherwise, the UE can attempt the service according to
3GPP TS 24.229 \[13\] and as described in subclause 5.2 via non-3GPP
access.

d\) if the UE is not configured with indication that MMTEL video is a
3GPP PS data off exempt service:

1\) the UE shall release according to 3GPP TS 24.229 \[13\] any
multimedia telephony communication session as described in
subclause 5.2, which is not an IMS emergency call, established with a
UE\'s contact address containing an IP address associated with a GPRS
IP-CAN bearer, and with video;

2\) the UE shall not send according to 3GPP TS 24.229 \[13\] a SIP
message related to a multimedia telephony communication session as
described in subclause 5.2, which is not an IMS emergency call, from a
UE\'s contact address containing an IP address associated with a GPRS
IP-CAN bearer and with:

A\) an SDP offer; or

B\) an SDP answer;

with video; and

e\) if the UE is not configured with indication that MMTEL voice is a
3GPP PS data off exempt service and the UE is not configured with
indication that MMTEL video is a 3GPP PS data off exempt service:

1\) the UE shall de-register the binding of a UE\'s contact address
containing an IP address associated with a GPRS IP-CAN bearer from IM CN
subsystem according to 3GPP TS 24.229 \[13\];

2\) the UE shall re-register the binding of a UE\'s contact address
containing an IP address associated with a GPRS IP-CAN bearer with IM CN
subsystem with a Contact header field without the g.3gpp.icsi-ref media
feature tag; or

3\) the UE shall re-register the binding of a UE\'s contact address
containing an IP address associated with a GPRS IP-CAN bearer with IM CN
subsystem with a Contact header field with the g.3gpp.icsi-ref media
feature tag not including the urn:urn-7:3gpp-service.ims.icsi.mmtel ICSI
according to 3GPP TS 24.229 \[13\].

NOTE 4: Which of the bullets 1), 2), and 3) the UE performs is
influenced by other 3GPP PS data off exempt services.

######## Annex M (normative): IP-Connectivity Access Network specific concepts when using 5GS to access IM CN subsystem

M.1 Scope
=========

The present annex defines IP-CAN specific requirements for a multimedia
telephony communication service and associated supplementary services in
the IP Multimedia (IM) Core Network (CN) subsystem, where the IP-CAN is
5G System (5GS).

M.2 5GS aspects when connected to the IM CN subsystem
=====================================================

M.2.1 Procedures at the UE
--------------------------

### M.2.1.1 Unified Access Control

The following information is provided to the non-access stratum:

\- MO-MMTEL-voice-started;

\- MO-MMTEL-voice-ended;

\- MO-MMTEL-video-started;

\- MO-MMTEL-video-ended; and

\- handover of ongoing MMTEL voice call from non-3GPP access; and

\- handover of ongoing MMTEL video call from non-3GPP access.

Upon request from a user to establish an originating multimedia
telephony communication session as described in subclause 5.2:

1\) if the multimedia telephony communication session to be established
is an emergency session, then skip the rest of steps below and continue
with session establishment as described in subclause 5.2;

2\) if only audio or only real-time text or only both audio and
real-time text (see subclause 4.2 for 3GPP systems) are offered in the
multimedia telephony communication session, and no other originating
multimedia telephony communication session initiated with offering only
audio or only real-time text or only both audio and real-time text
exists, the UE sends the MO-MMTEL-voice-started indication to the
non-access stratum and

a\) if the barring result is \"not-barred\", continue with session
establishment as described in subclause 5.2; and

b\) if the barring result is \"barred\", reject the multimedia telephony
communication session establishment and skip the rest of steps below;
and

3\) if video is offered in the multimedia telephony communication
session, and no other originating multimedia telephony communication
session initiated with offering video exists, the UE sends the
MO-MMTEL-video-started indication to the non-access stratum and

a\) if the barring result is \"not-barred\", continue with session
establishment as described in subclause 5.2; and

b\) if the barring result is \"barred\", reject the multimedia telephony
communication session establishment and skip the rest of steps below.

NOTE: Adding or removing media during the multimedia telephony
communication session is not subject to unified access control.

When an originating multimedia telephony communication session ends
(i.e. a response to a BYE or a failure response to the initial INVITE
request is transferred), the originating multimedia telephony
communication session was initiated with offering only audio or only
real-time text or only both audio and real-time text (i.e. in the SDP
offer in the initial INVITE request), and no other originating
multimedia telephony communication session initiated with offering only
audio or only real-time text or only both audio and real-time text
exists, the UE sends the MO-MMTEL-voice-ended to the non-access stratum.

When an originating multimedia telephony communication session ends
(i.e. a response to a BYE or a failure response to the initial INVITE
request is transferred), the originating multimedia telephony
communication session was initiated with offering video (i.e. in the SDP
offer in the initial INVITE request), and no other originating
multimedia telephony communication session initiated with offering video
exists, the UE sends the MO-MMTEL-video-ended indication to the
non-access stratum.

When an ongoing multimedia telephony communication session is handed
over from non-3GPP access to 3GPP access:

1\) if only audio or only real-time text or only both audio and
real-time text (see subclause 4.2 for 3GPP systems) are used in the
multimedia telephony communication session, the UE sends the
MO-MMTEL-voice-started indication and the handover of ongoing MMTEL
voice call from non-3GPP access indication to the non-access stratum;
and

2\) if video is used in the multimedia telephony communication session,
the UE sends the MO-MMTEL-video-started indication and the handover of
ongoing MMTEL video call from non-3GPP access indication to the
non-access stratum.

### M.2.1.2 MMTEL request timeouts

If the UE supports timer RequestTimeout, then upon a request from a user
to establish an originating multimedia telephony communication session
as described in subclause 5.2, the UE shall start timer RequestTimeout
when sending an initial INVITE request.

The UE may support being configured for the RequestTimeout timer with
the operator\'s IMS multimedia telephony communication service policy as
specified in 3GPP TS 24.275 \[36\].

### M.2.1.2A Registration and authentication

If:

a\) the UE includes a \"+g.3gpp.icsi-ref\" header field parameter equal
to \"urn:urn-7:3gpp-service.ims.icsi.mmtel\" in the Contact header field
of the SIP REGISTER request; and

b\) the IP-CAN of 5GS indicated that interworking without N26 is
supported as specified in 3GPP TS 24.501 \[42\];

the UE should include a transport=tcp URI parameter in the Contact
header field of the SIP REGISTER request.

NOTE 1: The UE includes a transport=tcp parameter to ensure that the
P-CSCF uses TCP connection when it receives an initial request for a
dialog or a request for a standalone transaction destined for the UE.
The use of TCP is to ensure the reception of transmitted SIP messages in
case fallback to EPS for voice is used and the IP-CAN of 5GS supports
interworking without N26.

If:

a\) the UE changes from another IP-CAN to an IP-CAN of 5GS; and

b\) the IP-CAN of 5GS indicated that interworking without N26 is
supported as specified in 3GPP TS 24.501 \[42\];

the UE may perform re-registration of a previously registered public
user identity bound to the other IP-CAN. In this case, if the UE
includes a \"+g.3gpp. icsi-ref\" header field parameter equal to
\"urn:urn-7:3gpp-service.ims.icsi.mmtel\" in the Contact header field of
the SIP REGISTER request, the UE should include a transport=tcp URI
parameter in the Contact header field of the SIP REGISTER request.

NOTE 2: This document does not specify how the UE detects that the used
IP-CAN has changed.

NOTE 3: The UE can send the reregistration request irrespective of
whether or not it has established a SIP dialog.

### M.2.1.3 Abnormal cases

Upon request from a user to establish an MMTEL voice session as
described in subclause 5.2, if

a\) the UE receives, from the lower layers, a notification that the
service request

1\) was not accepted due to congestion; or

2\) resulted in starting timer T3525 (see 3GPP TS 24.501 \[42\]); and

b\) an originating initial INVITE transaction, for which a 2xx response
has not yet been received, exists;

then:

a\) if a provisional response has been received, the UE shall cancel the
INVITE transaction; and

b\) if an alternative radio access network is available, the UE shall
attempt the MMTEL voice session on the alternative radio access network.

M.3 Application usage of SIP
============================

M.3.1 Procedures at the UE
--------------------------

### M.3.1.1 3GPP PS data off

#### M.3.1.1.1 General

The requirements in subclause J.3.1.1.1 apply.

#### M.3.1.1.2 Enforcement

If the 3GPP PS data off status is \"active\":

a\) the UE shall release according to 3GPP TS 24.229 \[13\] any
multimedia telephony communication session as described in
subclause 5.2, which is not an IMS emergency call, established with a
UE\'s contact address containing an IP address associated with a 5GS QoS
flow using NG-RAN, with media streams:

1\) other than only audio;

2\) other than only real-time text;

3\) other than only audio and real-time text; and

4\) not including video;

NOTE 1: When the 3GPP PS data off status is \"active\", an MMTEL session
which is not MMTEL voice and which is not MMTEL video (e.g. MMTEL
session with only fax) is released.

b\) the UE shall not send according to 3GPP TS 24.229 \[13\] a SIP
message related to a multimedia telephony communication session as
described in subclause 5.2, which is not an IMS emergency call, from a
UE\'s contact address containing an IP address associated with a 5GS QoS
flow using NG-RAN, and with:

1\) an SDP offer; or

2\) an SDP answer;

with media streams:

1\) other than only audio;

2\) other than only real-time text;

3\) other than only audio and real-time text; and

4\) not including video;

NOTE 2: When the 3GPP PS data off status is \"active\", an MMTEL session
which is not MMTEL voice and which is not MMTEL video (e.g. MMTEL
session with only fax) cannot be initiated.

c\) if the UE is not configured with indication that MMTEL voice is a
3GPP PS data off exempt service:

1\) the UE shall release according to 3GPP TS 24.229 \[13\] any
multimedia telephony communication session as described in
subclause 5.2, which is not an IMS emergency call, established with a
UE\'s contact address containing an IP address associated with an 5GS
QoS flow using NG-RAN, with only audio, only real-time text or only
audio and real-time text; and

2\) the UE shall not send according to 3GPP TS 24.229 \[13\] a SIP
message related to a multimedia telephony communication session as
described in subclause 5.2, which is not an IMS emergency call, from a
UE\'s contact address containing an IP address associated with a 5GS QoS
flow using NG-RAN and with:

A\) an SDP offer; or

B\) an SDP answer;

with only audio, only real-time text or only audio and real-time text;

NOTE 3: If the UE doesn\'t send an intitial SIP INVITE due to conditions
as described in bullet c.2, the UE can attempt a request for a service
equivalent to MMTel voice via the CS domain -- if supported and
available -- and, otherwise, the UE can attempt the service according to
3GPP TS 24.229 \[13\] and as described in subclause 5.2 via non-3GPP
access.

d\) if the UE is not configured with indication that MMTEL video is a
3GPP PS data off exempt service:

1\) the UE shall release according to 3GPP TS 24.229 \[13\] any
multimedia telephony communication session as described in
subclause 5.2, which is not an IMS emergency call, established with a
UE\'s contact address containing an IP address associated with a 5GS QoS
flow using NG-RAN, and with video;

2\) the UE shall not send according to 3GPP TS 24.229 \[13\] a SIP
message related to a multimedia telephony communication session as
described in subclause 5.2, which is not an IMS emergency call, from a
UE\'s contact address containing an IP address associated with a 5GS QoS
flow using NG-RAN and with:

A\) an SDP offer; or

B\) an SDP answer;

with video; and

e\) if the UE is not configured with indication that MMTEL voice is a
3GPP PS data off exempt service and the UE is not configured with
indication that MMTEL video is a 3GPP PS data off exempt service:

1\) the UE shall de-register the binding of a UE\'s contact address
containing an IP address associated with an 5GS QoS flow using NG-RAN
from IM CN subsystem according to 3GPP TS 24.229 \[13\];

2\) the UE shall re-register the binding of a UE\'s contact address
containing an IP address associated with an 5GS QoS flow using NG-RAN
with IM CN subsystem with a Contact header field without the
g.3gpp.icsi-ref media feature tag; or

3\) the UE shall re-register the binding of a UE\'s contact address
containing an IP address associated with an 5GS QoS flow with IM CN
subsystem with a Contact header field with the g.3gpp.icsi-ref media
feature tag not including the urn:urn-7:3gpp-service.ims.icsi.mmtel ICSI
according to 3GPP TS 24.229 \[13\].

NOTE 4: Which of the bullets 1), 2), and 3) the UE performs is
influenced by other 3GPP PS data off exempt services.

### M.3.1.2 Establishing an MMTEL session

If the UE is establishing an MMTEL session offering audio and if the
IP-CAN of 5GS indicated that interworking without N26 is supported as
specified in 3GPP TS 24.501 \[42\], the UE should transmit the SIP
INVITE request using TCP as transport protocol.

NOTE: The use of TCP is to ensure the reception of transmitted SIP
messages in case fallback to EPS for voice is used and the IP-CAN of 5GS
supports interworking without N26.
