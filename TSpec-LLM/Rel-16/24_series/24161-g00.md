4 General
=========

This document specifies the following procedures for Network-Based IP
Flow Mobility (NBIFOM) as specified in 3GPP TS 23.161 \[2\] between the
User Equipment (UE) and the network. The present document specifies the
following procedures for support of NBIFOM in clause 5:

a\) Initial PDN connection establishment procedure;

b\) Extending NBIFOM traffic flows to additional access network;

c\) IP flow mobility between 3GPP and WLAN;

d\) Removal of an access from a PDN connection;

e\) IP flow mapping procedures;

f\) Handling of change of access usability; and

g\) Handling of Access stratum indication.

For a), b), e), f) and g), the procedures are always initiated by the
UE. Specifically, for e) and g), the procedures are performed only if
the network-initiated NBIFOM mode is selected as specified in
subclause 5.4 of 3GPP TS 23.161 \[2\].

For c), the procedure is initiated by:

\- the UE if the UE-initiated NBIFOM mode is selected as specified in
subclause 5.4 of 3GPP TS 23.161 \[2\]; or

\- the network if the network-initiated NBIFOM mode is selected as
specified in subclause 5.4 of 3GPP TS 23.161 \[2\].

For d), the procedure may be initiated by the UE or the network.

This document also defines the coding of the PDUs and parameters for
NBIFOM in clause 6.

5 NBIFOM control procedures
===========================

5.1 Initial PDN connection establishment procedures
---------------------------------------------------

### 5.1.1 UE procedures

#### 5.1.1.1 UE-initiated PDN connection establishment over GERAN or UTRAN

This procedure can only be executed if the UE is operating in A/Gb mode
or Iu mode. The UE shall not trigger an inter-system change to A/Gb mode
of operation or Iu mode of operation to execute this procedure.

Upon request from upper layers to setup a PDN connection with NBIFOM
support over GERAN or UTRAN, the UE shall initiate the PDP context
activation procedure according to 3GPP TS 24.008 \[3\].

In the ACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT REQUEST message of the PDP context
activation procedure:

a\) the UE shall set the request type IE to \"initial request\";

b\) the UE shall include the protocol configuration options IE. In the
protocol configuration options IE, the UE shall include the NBIFOM
request indicator; and

c\) the UE shall include the NBIFOM container IE. In the NBIFOM
container IE, the UE shall include the NBIFOM mode parameter indicating
the requested NBIFOM mode.

Upon receiving from the network an ACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT ACCEPT message
with the NBIFOM container IE containing the NBIFOM status parameter set
to \"Accepted\":

a\) the UE shall consider that NBIFOM applies to the PDN connection;

b\) the UE shall consider the NBIFOM mode parameter of the NBIFOM

the PDN MODIFICATION REJECT message as the cause of failure.

#### 5.7.1.5 Access stratum indication via untrusted WLAN

If NBIFOM applies to a PDN connection, the network-initiated NBIFOM mode
is the selected NBIFOM mode, the RAN rules control the WLAN access
selection and traffic routing as described in 3GPP TS 24.302 \[5\], the
RAN rules handling parameter is set, the PDN connection is a
multi-access PDN connection for IP flows over 3GPP accesses and over
untrusted WLAN, the move-traffic-to-WLAN indication specified in
3GPP TS 24.302 \[5\] is received from the access stratum layer of the
3GPP access, and the Local Operating Environment Information in the UE
does not contain non-radio-related conditions that prohibit the use of
WLAN access then the UE shall initiate the UE-initiated modification
procedure according to 3GPP TS 24.302 \[5\].

NOTE: The WLAN offload indication information element described in
3GPP TS 24.301 \[4\] and 3GPP TS 24.008 \[3\] does not influence
execution of the Access stratum indication via untrusted WLAN.

In the INFORMATIONAL request message of the UE-initiated modification
procedure, the UE shall include the NBIFOM\_GENERIC\_CONTAINER Notify
payload. In the NBIFOM\_GENERIC\_CONTAINER Notify payload, the UE shall
include the NBIFOM Access stratum status parameter with value indicating
the indication received from the access stratum layer of the 3GPP
access.

Upon receiving an INFORMATIONAL request message of the ePDG-initiated
modification procedure such that:

a\) the received INFORMATIONAL request message contains a PTI Notify
payload with the Related Message ID field set to the Message ID field of
the sent INFORMATIONAL request message; and

b\) the IEs of the received INFORMATIONAL request message are
acceptable;

then:

a\) if the received INFORMATIONAL request message does not contain the
NBIFOM routing rules parameter in the NBIFOM\_GENERIC\_CONTAINER Notify
payload, the UE shall send an INFORMATIONAL response message without a
Notify payload indicating an error; and

b\) if the received INFORMATIONAL request message contains the NBIFOM
routing rules parameter in the NBIFOM\_GENERIC\_CONTAINER Notify
payload:

1\) if the UE accepts the requested routing rules indicated in the
NBIFOM routing rules parameter:

A\) the UE shall send an INFORMATIONAL response message without a Notify
payload indicating an error; and

B\) the UE shall apply the requested routing rules; and

2\) if the UE rejects the requested routing rules indicated in the
NBIFOM routing rules parameter, the UE shall send an INFORMATIONAL
response message. In the INFORMATIONAL response message, the UE shall
include a Notify payload indicating an error and shall include the
NBIFOM\_GENERIC\_CONTAINER Notify payload. In the
NBIFOM\_GENERIC\_CONTAINER Notify payload, the UE shall include the
NBIFOM status parameter with appropriate error value.

If however, the UE receives an INFORMATIONAL request message of the
ePDG-initiated modification procedure such that:

a\) the received INFORMATIONAL request message contains a Notify payload
indicating an error; and

b\) the received INFORMATIONAL request message contains a PTI Notify
payload with the Related Message ID field set to the Message ID field of
the sent INFORMATIONAL request message;

then:

a\) the UE shall consider the NBIFOM status parameter of the
NBIFOM\_GENERIC\_CONTAINER Notify payload of the INFORMATIONAL request
message as the cause of failure; and

b\) the UE shall send an INFORMATIONAL response message.

Status parameter \#26 -- Insufficient resources

This status code is used by the UE or by the network to indicate that
the requested routing rule cannot be accepted due to insufficient
resources for the requested routing access.

Status parameter \#33 -- Requested service option not subscribed

This status code is used when the UE requested routing access cannot be
used to transport the requested service due to the restriction of
subscription.

Status parameter \#34 -- Service option temporarily out of order

This status code is used when the requested routing rule cannot be
accepted due to temporary outage of one or more functions required for
supporting the service via the requested routing access.

Status parameter \#31 -- Request rejected, unspecified

This status code is used by the network or by the UE to indicate that
the requested routing rule cannot be accepted due to unspecified
reasons.

Status parameter \#57 --Incorrect indication in the routing rule
operation

This status code is used by the network or the UE to indicate that the
requested routing rule cannot be accepted due to incorrect operation
code included in the request.

Status parameter \#58 -- Unknown information in IP flow filter(s)

This status code is used by the network or the UE to indicate that the
requested routing rule cannot be accepted due to unknown information
included in the routing rule\'s IP flow filter(s).

Status parameter \#111 -- Protocol error, unspecified

This status code is used to report a protocol error event only when no
other status code in the protocol error class applies.

Status parameter \#130 --Unknown routing access information

This status code is used by the network or by the UE to indicate that
the requested routing rule cannot be accepted due to unknown routing
access information.
