 Foreword
========

This Technical Specification has been produced by the 3rd Generation
Partnership Project (3GPP).

The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work
within the TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the
TSG modify the contents of the present document, it will be re-released
by the TSG with an identifying change of release date and an increase in
version number as follows:

Version x.y.z

where:

x the first digit:

1 presented to TSG for information;

2 presented to TSG for approval;

3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.

y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e.
technical enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.

z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been
incorporated in the document.

In the present document, modal verbs have the following meanings:

**shall** indicates a mandatory requirement to do something

**shall not** indicates an interdiction (prohibition) to do something

The constructions \"shall\" and \"shall not\" are confined to the
context of normative provisions, and do not appear in Technical Reports.

The constructions \"must\" and \"must not\" are not used as substitutes
for \"shall\" and \"shall not\". Their use is avoided insofar as
possible, and they are not used in a normative context except in a
direct citation from an external, referenced, non-3GPP document, or so
as to maintain continuity of style when extending or modifying the
provisions of such a referenced document.

**should** indicates a recommendation to do something

**should not** indicates a recommendation not to do something

**may** indicates permission to do something

**need not** indicates permission not to do something

The construction \"may not\" is ambiguous and is not used in normative
elements. The unambiguous constructions \"might not\" or \"shall not\"
are used instead, depending upon the meaning intended.

**can** indicates that something is possible

**cannot** indicates that something is impossible

The constructions \"can\" and \"cannot\" are not substitutes for \"may\"
and \"need not\".

**will** indicates that something is certain or expected to happen as a
result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside
the scope of the present document

**will not** indicates that something is certain or expected not to
happen as a result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which
is outside the scope of the present document

**might** indicates a likelihood that something will happen as a result
of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document

**might not** indicates a likelihood that something will not happen as a
result of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside
the scope of the present document

In addition:

**is** (or any other verb in the indicative mood) indicates a statement
of fact

**is not** (or any other negative verb in the indicative mood) indicates
a statement of fact

The constructions \"is\" and \"is not\" do not indicate requirements.

 1 Scope
=======

The present document specifies the protocol aspects for the network
resource management capability of SEAL to support vertical applications
(e.g. V2X) over the 3GPP system.

The present document is applicable to the user equipment (UE) supporting
the network resource management client functionality as described in
3GPP TS 23.434 \[2\], to the application server supporting the network
resource management server functionality as described in 3GPP
TS 23.434 \[2\] and to the application server supporting the vertical
application server (VAL server) functionality as defined in the specific
vertical application service (VAL service) specifications.

NOTE: The specification of the VAL server for a specific VAL service is
out of scope of present document.

resource management related capabilities (e.g. unicast and multicast
network resources) to one or more vertical applications. The present
document enables a SEAL network resource management client (SNRM-C) and
a VAL server that communicate with a SEAL network resource management
server (SNRM-S).

The SNRM-S obtains and controls multicast resources from the underlying
3GPP network system via the BM-SC and controls unicast resources from
the underlying 3GPP network system via the PCRF/PCF.

5 Functional entities
=====================

5.1 SEAL network resource management client (SNRM-C)
----------------------------------------------------

The SNRM-C functional entity acts as the application client for network
resource management related transactions. To be compliant with the
procedures in the present document the SNRM-C:

a\) shall support the role of XCAP client as specified in
IETF RFC 4825 \[19\];

b\) shall support the role of XDMC as specified in
OMA OMA-TS-XDM\_Core-V2\_1 \[21\]; and

c\) shall support the multicast resource management procedures in
clause 6.2.3.

5.2 SEAL network resource management SEAL server (SNRM-S)
---------------------------------------------------------

The SNRM-S is a functional entity used to provide resource management of
3GPP system network resources (e.g. unicast, multicast) to one or more
vertical applications. To be compliant with the procedures in the
present document the SNRM-S shall:

a\) shall support the role of XCAP server as specified in
IETF RFC 4825 \[19\];

b\) shall support the role of XDMS as specified in
OMA OMA-TS-XDM\_Core-V2\_1 \[21\];

c\) shall support the unicast resource management procedures in
clause 6.2.2; and

d\) shall support the multicast resource management procedures in
clause 6.2.3.

6 Network resource management procedures
========================================

6.1 General
-----------

6.2 On-network procedures
-------------------------

### 6.2.1 General

#### 6.2.1.1 Authenticated identity in HTTP request

Upon receiving an HTTP request, the SNRM-S shall authenticate the
identity of the sender of the HTTP request is authorized as specified in
3GPP TS 24.547 \[9\], and if authentication is successful, the SNRM-S
shall use the identity of the sender of the HTTP request as an
authenticated identity.

### 6.2.2 Unicast resource management

#### 6.2.2.1 General

This clause describes the procedures used for unicast resource
management. The unicast resource management comprises procedures for:

a\) activation and deactivation of bearers;

b\) modification of the QoS characteristics of a bearer; and

c\) modification of GBR due to application requirement.

The VAL client can request the VAL server to provide unicast resources
(see clause 6.2.2.2), to modify or to release unicast resources (see
clause 6.2.2.3) or to perform network resource adaptation (see
clause 6.2.2.4).

NOTE: A VAL service communication can consist of both unicast and
multicast bearers which can all need modification due to the same event.

VAL specific pre-requisites and resultant behaviour by functional
entities in performing the unicast resource management procedures are
specified in the respective VAL TS (e.g. for V2X application layer, see
3GPP TS 24.486 \[7\]).

Unicast resource management is supported with PCRF interactions with SIP
core and PCC interactions with the SNRM-S. The PCRF procedures are
specified in **3GPP TS 29.214** \[12\] and the PCF procedures are
specified in 3GPP TS 29.514 \[14\].

#### 6.2.2.2 Request for unicast resource at VAL service communication establishment procedure with SIP core

##### 6.2.2.2.1 VAL server procedure

If the VAL client requests VAL service communication with the VAL
server, the VAL server shall generate an HTTP POST request message
according to procedures specified in IETF RFC 2616 \[15\]. In the HTTP
POST request message, the VAL server:

#### 6.2.3.3 MBMS bearer announcement over MBMS bearer procedure

##### 6.2.3.3.1 General

The availability of a MBMS bearer is announced to SNRM-Cs by means of an
MBMS bearer announcement message. One or more MBMS bearer announcement
elements are included in an
application/vnd.3gpp.seal-mbms-usage-info+xml MIME body.

An MBMS bearer announcement message can contain new MBMS bearer
announcements, updated MBMS bearer announcements or cancelled MBMS
bearer announcements or a mix of all of them at the same time in an
application/vnd.3gpp.seal-mbms-usage-info+xml MIME body. Each initial
MBMS bearer announcement message announces one MBMS bearer intended to
carry a general purpose MBMS subchannel used for application level
multicast signalling in a specified MBMS service area and additionally,
the message could also announce zero or more extra MBMS bearers intended
to carry media and media control.

NOTE 1: A new MBMS bearer announcement does not implicitly remove
previously sent MBMS bearer announcements if the previously sent MBMS
bearer announcement is not included in an MBMS bearer announcement
message.

NOTE 2: The SNRM-C will use the same identity which has been
authenticated by VAL service with SIP core using SIP based REGISTER
message. If VAL service do not support SIP protocol, then HTTP based
method needs to be used.

NOTE 3: The VAL service can select appropriate procedure(s) based on
service specific requirements. If the VAL service supports both HTTP and
SIP, HTTP is prior.

When and to whom the SNRM-S sends the MBMS bearer announcement is based
on local policy in the SNRM-S.

status. The SNRM-C:

NOTE 1: The SNRM-C may determine the MBMS bearer quality by using the
BLER of the received data. When no data is received, the quality
estimation can consider the reference signals and the modulation and
coding scheme (MCS). The UE may also use predictive methods to estimate
the expected MBMS bearer quality (e.g. speed and direction) to
proactively inform the NRM server of an expected loss of the MBMS bearer
quality.

NOTE 2: The threshold used to indicate MBMS bearer quality depends on
VAL service type and the metrics used. The metrics used and the
associated thresholds are out of scope of this specification.

application/vnd.3gpp.seal-unicast-info+xml

Required parameters:

None

Optional parameters:

\"charset\" the parameter has identical semantics to the charset
parameter of the \"application/xml\" media type as specified in
section 9.1 of IETF RFC 7303.

Encoding considerations:

binary.

Security considerations:

Same as general security considerations for application/xml media type
as specified in section 9.1 of IETF RFC 7303. In addition, this media
type provides a format for exchanging information in SIP or in HTTP, so
the security considerations from IETF RFC 3261 apply while exchanging
information in SIP and the security considerations from IETF RFC 2616
apply while exchanging information in HTTP.

The information transported in this media type does not include active
or executable content.

Mechanisms for privacy and integrity protection of protocol parameters
exist. Those mechanisms as well as authentication and further security
mechanisms are described in 3GPP TS 24.229.

This media type does not include provisions for directives that
institute actions on a recipient\'s files or other resources.

This media type does not include provisions for directives that
institute actions that, while not directly harmful to the recipient, may
result in disclosure of information that either facilitates a subsequent
attack or else violates a recipient\'s privacy in any way.

This media type does not employ compression.

Interoperability considerations:

Same as general interoperability considerations for application/xml
media type as specified in section 9.1 of IETF RFC 7303. Any unknown XML
elements and any unknown XML attributes are to be ignored by recipient
of the MIME body.

Published specification:

3GPP TS 24.548 \"Network Resource Management - Service Enabler
Architecture Layer for Verticals (SEAL); Protocol specification\"
version 16.0.0, available via http://www.3gpp.org/specs/numbering.htm.
