1 Scope
=======

The present document specifies a mobile device Selective Disabling of
3GPP UE Capabilities (SDoUE) Management Object (MO) and the rules and
corresponding behaviour of the UE with regard to the selective disabling
of 3GPP UE capabilities, for example, when services or functions are
disabled/enabled.

The SDoUE MO is compatible with the OMA Device Management (DM) protocol
specifications, version 1.2 and upwards, and is defined using the OMA DM
Device Description Framework (DDF) as described in the Enabler Release
Definition OMA-ERELD-DM-V1\_2 \[8\].

The SDoUE MO consists of the relevant parameters that can be managed for
selective disabling of 3GPP UE capabilities.

The SDoUE MO defines a repository of data into the ME.

The service requirements for selective disabling of 3GPP UE capabilities
are defined in 3GPP TS 22.011 \[2\].

4 Selective Disabling of 3GPP UE Capabilities Management Object
===============================================================

The Selective Disabling of 3GPP UE Capabilities (SDoUE) Management
Object (MO) is used to manage settings of the UE for remotely disabling
selected UE capabilities.

The Management Object Identifier is: urn:oma:mo:ext-3gpp-sdoue:1.0.

The OMA DM Access Control List (ACL) property mechanism as standardized
(see Enabler Release Definition OMA-ERELD-DM-V1\_2 \[8\]) may be used to
grant or deny access rights to OMA DM servers in order to modify nodes
and leaf objects of the SDoUE MO.

The following nodes and leaf objects are possible under the SDoUE node:

release of all emergency calls that use call control procedures.
Furthermore, the UE shall not use call control procedures to establish
emergency calls until the CS\_EmergencyCalls node value is set to \"0\"
or the UE detects a change of Mobile Country Code (MCC) and Mobile
Network Code (MNC) that does not match any of the stored Country and
Network pairs of nodes.

NOTE 2: As described by the definition and structure of the SDoUE MO the
Country and Network nodes, if exist, constitute a pair of nodes.
However, it is possible to indicate only a country/region by means of
only setting the value of the Country node.

contexts (see 3GPP TS 24.008 \[3\]). Additionally, the UE shall not use
mobile-originated GPRS SM procedures for PDP contexts until the
GPRS\_SM\_PDP leaf value is set to \"0\". The UE is however allowed to
use mobile-originated GPRS SM procedure for PDP context activation in
the following cases:

\- upon receipt of an OMA DM notification message indicating that the UE
shall initiate an OMA DM session to the OMA DM server that either had
set the disable value of the GPRS\_SM\_PDP leaf or is the one stored in
the AlertServerID leaf;

\- when the mobile-originated PDP context activation procedure is
necessary in order to either establish an emergency call over IMS (if
the IMS\_EmergencyCalls value is set to \"0\") or send an OMA DM generic
alert message according to the sub-clause 5.17A.

5.12 /*\<X\>*/GPRS\_SM\_MBMS

When the EPS\_SM\_EPS leaf value is set to \"1\", the UE shall proceed
as follows:

The UE shall initiate a UE requested PDN connectivity procedure (see
3GPP TS 24.301 \[7A\]). If the APN leaf exists, the UE shall use the
value stored in the APN leaf as the APN in the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST

CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message.

After successful completion of the UE requested PDN connectivity
procedure, if the TrafficMappingInfo interior node exists, the UE shall
locally use the information provided by the TrafficMappingInfo (i.e.
packet filters) in order to determine the traffic mapping to the EPS
context established by the UE requested PDN connectivity procedure.
Furthermore, this information shall be used by the UE until the
EPS\_SM\_EPS leaf value is set to \"0\". The UE is however allowed to
temporarily stop to use the traffic mapping information in the following
cases:

\- upon receipt of an OMA DM notification message indicating that the UE
shall initiate an OMA DM session to the OMA DM server that either had
set the disable value of the EPS\_SM\_EPS leaf or is the one stored in
the AlertServerID leaf;

\- when the UE wishes to either establish an emergency call over IMS (if
the IMS\_EmergencyCalls value is set to \"0\") or send an OMA DM generic
alert message according to the sub-clause 5.17A.

Later, the UE shall initiate the signalling procedure for UE requested
PDN disconnection (see 3GPP TS 24.301 \[7A\]) of all PDNs but the one
which was established by the successful completion of the UE requested
PDN connectivity procedure.

Finally, the UE shall not use mobile-requested EPS SM procedures for EPS

are disabled.

When the 5GS\_SM\_PDU leaf value is set to \"1\", the UE shall initiate
the signalling procedure for UE-requested PDU session release procedure
(see 3GPP TS 24.501 \[7B\]). Additionally, the UE shall not use
UE-requested 5GSM procedures for PDU sessions until the 5GS\_SM\_PDU
leaf value is set to \"0\". The UE is however allowed to use
UE-requested 5GSM procedure for PDU session establishment in the
following cases:

\- upon receipt of an OMA DM notification message indicating that the UE
shall initiate an OMA DM session to the OMA DM server that either had
set the disable value of the 5GS\_SM\_PDU leaf or is the one stored in
the AlertServerID leaf; and

\- when the UE-requested PDU session establishment procedure is
necessary in order to either establish an emergency call over IMS (if
the IMS\_EmergencyCalls value is set to \"0\") or send an OMA DM generic
alert message according to the subclause 5.17A.

(see subclause 5.12A).

5.14 /*\<X\>*/Text
------------------

The Text leaf provides a means for including information that will be
displayed by the ME. The information contained in the text leaf should
be in the ME selected language, via the OMA DM standard procedure. The
information should contain information in order to assist in determining
the cause of non-availability of specific services and what to do for
example, a text string indicating the disabled service(s) and customer
service number(s). An example of possible information to be displayed:
\"The GPRS service of the handset is currently disabled. For further
information, please contact TelServices Help Centre by calling 111 from
your handset or +44 7777 111 111 whilst abroad. Alternatively, you may
wish to get in touch with us by email at help\@telservices.net\".

\- Occurrence: ZeroOrOne

\- Format: chr

\- Access Types: Get

\- Values: \<End-user displayable text string\>

When the OMA DM server updates the value of this leaf, the OMA DM server
must be configured to ensure that the information provided in the
CustomerCareNumbers, described in the sub-clauses 5.15, 5.16 and 5.17,
is updated accordingly, i.e. the same customer care service number(s)
is(are) provided by the CustomerCareNumbers.

The ME should use and display all the information provided by the Text
leaf to inform the end-user about the non-availability of services
and/or customer care service number(s). The possible interactions with
the end-user are implementation specific.

5.15 /*\<X\>*/CustomerCareNumbers/
----------------------------------

The CustomerCareNumbers interior node is used to allow a reference to a
list of customer care service numbers.

\- Occurrence: ZeroOrOne

\- Format: node

\- Access Types: Get

\- Values: N/A

When the OMA DM server updates the values of the CustomerCareNumbers
sub-nodes, the OMA DM server must be configured to ensure that the
information provided in the Text leaf, described in the sub-clause 5.14,
is updated accordingly, i.e. the same customer care service number(s)
is(are) provided by the Text leaf.

5.16 /*\<X\>*/CustomerCareNumbers/*\<X\>*
-----------------------------------------

This run-time node acts as a placeholder for one or more customer care
service numbers.

\- Occurrence: OneOrMore

\- Format: node

\- Access Types: Get

\- Values: N/A

5.17 /*\<X\>*/CustomerCareNumbers/\<X\>/CustomerCareNumber
----------------------------------------------------------

The CustomerCareNumber leaf represents one customer care service number.
This leaf provides a means for including information about customer care
service number which can be used, by the end-user, in determining the
cause of non-availability of specific services.

The CustomerCareNumber leaf value shall be either a telephone number
according to the E.164 scheme (see ITU-T Rec. E.164 \[9\]) or
nationally-specific operator number, e.g. 191, 150.

\- Occurrence: One

\- Format: chr

\- Access Types: Get

\- Values: \<Customer care service number\>

5.17A /*\<X\>*/AlertServerID
----------------------------

The AlertServerID leaf indicates the server identifier for an OMA DM
server. This leaf provides a means for informing about the fact that the
SDoUE MO has been modified.

The AlertServerID leaf value is used by the UE to send an OMA DM generic
alert message (see Enabler Release Definition OMA-ERELD-DM-V1\_2 \[8\])
any time the SDoUE MO is modified by an OMA DM server different than the
one indicated by the AlertServerID leaf value.

\- Occurrence: ZeroOrOne

\- Format: chr

\- Access Types: Get

\- Values: \<Server identifier\>

The UE shall send an OMA DM generic alert message immediately after the
SDoUE MO has been modified by an OMA DM server different than the one
identified by the AlertServerID leaf value. The Type element of the OMA
DM generic alert message shall be set to \"Reserved-Domain-Name:
org.3gpp.SDoUE.changesperformedalert\".

5.18 /*\<X\>*/ IMS\_EmergencyCalls
----------------------------------

The IMS\_EmergencyCalls interior node indicates an operator's preference
to enable or disable emergency call procedures over IMS.

NOTE 1: Disabling of emergency call control procedures over IMS is
subject to regional regulatory requirements. Therefore, emergency call
control procedures over IMS cannot be disabled in regions where support
of them is required (see 3GPP TS 22.011 \[2\]).

The emergency call procedures over IMS are specified in
3GPP TS 24.229 \[7\].

\- Occurrence: ZeroOrOne

\- Format: bool

\- Access Types: Get

\- Values: 0, 1

0 -- Indicates that emergency calls over IMS are enabled.

1 -- Indicates that emergency calls over IMS are disabled.

When the IMS\_EmergencyCalls node value is set to \"1\" and the UE
detects being under coverage of a PLMN (identified by Mobile Country
Code (MCC) and Mobile Network Code (MNC)) as indicated by any of the
stored Country and Network pairs of nodes (see sub-clauses 5.19, 5.20
and 5.21), then the UE shall initiate the signalling procedure for
release of all emergency calls over IMS. Furthermore, the UE shall not
use IMS procedures to establish emergency calls until the
IMS\_EmergencyCalls node value is set to \"0\" or the UE detects a
change of Mobile Country Code (MCC) and Mobile Network Code (MNC) that
does not match any of the stored Country and Network pairs of nodes.

NOTE 2: As described by the definition and structure of the SDoUE MO the
Country and Network nodes, if exist, constitute a pair of nodes.
However, it is possible to indicate only a country/region by means of
only setting the value of the Country node.

5.19 /*\<X\>*/IMS\_EmergencyCalls/\<X\>
---------------------------------------

This run-time node acts as a placeholder for one or more Country nodes.
Furthermore, this node provides a means for the operator to indicate
where emergency call procedures over IMS are disabled (i.e. The
IMS\_EmergencyCalls value is set to \"1\").

\- Occurrence: ZeroOrMore

\- Format: node

\- Access Types: Get

\- Values: N/A

5.20 /*\<X\>*/IMS\_EmergencyCalls/\<X\>/Country
-----------------------------------------------

The Country interior node represents one Mobile Country Code (MCC). This
node provides a means for including information that can be used to
indicate in which MCC the emergency call procedures over IMS are
disabled (i.e. The IMS\_EmergencyCalls value is set to \"1\").

The Country node value shall be a Mobile Country Code (MCC) as specified
by *ITU-T* *E.212* \[10\].

\- Occurrence: One

\- Format: chr

\- Access Types: Get

\- Values: \<Mobile Country Code\>

The UE shall only use the information stored in the Country node when
emergency call control procedures are disabled (i.e. The
IMS\_EmergencyCalls value is set to \"1\").

5.21 /*\<X\>*/IMS\_EmergencyCalls/\<X\>/Country/Network
-------------------------------------------------------

The Network leaf represents one Mobile Network Code (MNC). This leaf
provides a means, together with the Country leaf, for including
information that can be used to indicate in which MCC and MNC the
emergency call procedures over IMS are disabled.

The Network leaf value shall be a Mobile Network Code (MNC) as specified
by *ITU-T* *E.212* \[10\].

\- Occurrence: ZeroOrOne

\- Format: chr

\- Access Types: Get

\- Values: \<Mobile Network Code\>

The UE shall only use the information stored in the Network leaf when
emergency call procedures over IMS are disabled (i.e. The
IMS\_EmergencyCalls value is set to \"1\"). Furthermore, the UE shall
interpret the information stored in the Network leaf, if exists, in
conjunction with the corresponding Country node.

5.22 /*\<X\>*/Ext
-----------------

The Ext is an interior node for where the vendor specific information
about the SDoUE MO is being placed (vendor meaning application vendor,
device vendor etc.). Usually the vendor extension is identified by
vendor specific name under the ext node. The tree structure under the
vendor identified is not defined and can therefore include one or more
un-standardized sub-trees.

\- Occurrence: ZeroOrOne

\- Format: node

\- Access Types: Get

\- Values: N/A

######## Annex A (informative): Management Object DDF

This DDF is the standardized minimal set. A vendor can define it's own
DDF for the complete device. This DDF can include more features than
this minimal standardized version.
