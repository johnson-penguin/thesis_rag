4 General description
=====================

Configuration management is a SEAL service that provides the
configuration management related capabilities to one or more vertical
applications. The present document enables a SEAL configuration
management client (SCM-C) and a VAL server to manage configuration data
in a SEAL configuration management server (SCM-S).

5 Functional entities
=====================

5.1 SEAL configuration management client (SCM-C)
------------------------------------------------

The SCM-C functional entity acts as the application client for
configuration related transactions. To be compliant with the procedures
in the present document the SCM-C:

\- shall support the role of XCAP client as specified in
IETF RFC 4825 \[3\];

\- shall support the role of XDMC as specified in
OMA OMA-TS-XDM\_Core-V2\_1 \[4\];

\- shall support the procedures in clause 6.2.2;

\- shall support the procedures in clause 6.2.3; and

6 Configuration management procedures
=====================================

6.1 General
-----------

6.2 On-network procedures
-------------------------

### 6.2.1 General

#### 6.2.1.1 Authenticated identity in HTTP request

Upon receiving an HTTP request, the SCM-S shall authenticate the
identity of the sender of the HTTP request as specified in
3GPP TS 24.547 \[5\], and if authentication is successful, the SCM-S
shall use the identity of the sender of the HTTP request as an
authenticated identity.

### 6.2.2 Common procedures

#### 6.2.2.1 Management of configuration update event subscription

##### 6.2.2.1.1 SIP based procedures

##### 6.2.2.1.1.1 General {#general-2 .H6}

The VAL service will use the same identity which has been authenticated
by VAL service with SIP core using SIP based REGISTER message. If VAL
service do not support SIP protocol, then HTTP based method needs to be
used.

The SCM-C shall use mechanism provided by VAL service to add
access-token in SIP messages. The SCM-S shall identify the originating
VAL user ID from the access-token received from SCM-C using the
mechanism defined in VAL service specification.

##### 6.2.2.1.1.2 Create subscription {#create-subscription .H6}

In order to subscribe to notification of changes of one or more group
documents of VAL groups identified by VAL group IDs, a SCM-C shall send
an initial SIP SUBSCRIBE request to the network according to the UE
originating procedures specified in 3GPP TS 24.229 \[8\] and
IETF RFC 5875 \[9\]. In the initial SIP SUBSCRIBE request, the SCM-C:

a\) shall set the Request-URI to the configured public service identity
for performing subscription proxy function of the SCM-S;

b\) shall include the ICSI value
\"urn:urn-7:3gpp-service.ims.icsi.seal\" (coded as specified in
3GPP TS 24.229 \[8\]), in a P-Preferred-Service header field according
to IETF RFC 6050 \[10\];

c\) shall include the g.3gpp.icsi-ref media feature tag containing the
value of \"urn:urn-7:3gpp-service.ims.icsi.seal\" in the Contact header
field;

d\) shall include an application/resource-lists+xml MIME body. In the
application/resource-lists+xml MIME body, the SCM-C shall include one
\<entry\> element for each configuration document to be subscribed to,
such that the \"uri\" attribute of the \<entry\> element contains a

### 7.1.5 Semantics

The \<seal-user-profile\> element is the root element of the XML
document.

The \<ProfileName\> element of \<seal-user-profile\> element specifies
the name of the SEAL user profile configuration document.

The \<Status\> element of \<seal-user-profile\> element is of type
\"Boolean\" and indicates whether this particular SEAL user profile is
enabled or disabled.

The \<isDefault\> element of \<seal-user-profile\> element is of type
\"Boolean\" and indicates whether this particular SEAL user profile is
default profile for VAL user or not.

The \<user-profile-index\> element of \<seal-user-profile\> element
contains a positive number which provides profile id. This element is
used only when multiple user-profile for a VAL user is supported.

The \<profile-configuration\> element of \<seal-user-profile\> element
contains actual profile configuration. The VAL application which uses
SEAL user-profile may provide its own profile configuration specific to
VAL application.

The VAL service may further extend the \<Common\> element of the
\<profile-configuration\> element of the \<seal-user-profile\> element
to include VAL service specific common user profile configuration.

The VAL service may further extend the \<OnNetwork\> element of the
\<profile-configuration\> element of the \<seal-user-profile\> element
to include VAL service specific user profile configuration for
on-network features.

The VAL service may further extend the \<OffNetwork\> element of the
\<profile-configuration\> element of the \<seal-user-profile\> element
to include VAL service specific user profile configuration for
off-network features.

### 7.1.6 MIME type

### 7.2.5 Semantics

The \"domain\" attribute of the \<seal-UE-configuration\> element
contains the domain name of the VAL service.

The \<name\> element of the \<seal-UE- configuration\> element contains
the user displayable name of the SEAL UE configuration document.

The creator of the SEAL UE configuration document may include an
\<VAL-UE-id\> element in the version of the SEAL UE configuration
document that is uploaded to the SCM-S. If an \<VAL-UE-id\> element is
included then the SEAL UE configuration document applies only to the VAL
UE(s) identified by the \<VAL-UE-id\> element. If no \<VAL-UE-id\>
element is included then the SEAL UE configuration document applies to
all the VAL UEs of the domain.

The \<VAL-Service-id\> element contains identify of the VAL service for
which the configuration document is applicable.

If one or more optional \<Instance-ID-URN\> elements is included in the
\<VAL-UE-id\> element then the SEAL UE configuration document applies to
the VAL UE with an instance ID equal to the instance ID contained in the
\<Instance-ID-URN\> element.

The \<TAC\> element of the \<IMEI-range\> element contains the Type
Allocation Code of the VAL UE.

The optional \<SNR\> element of the \<IMEI-range\> element contains the
individual serial number uniquely identifying VAL UE within the Type
Allocation Code contained in the \<TAC\> element that the SEAL UE
configuration document applies to.

If an optional \<SNR-range\> element is included within the
\<IMEI-range\> element then the SEAL UE configuration document applies
to all VAL UEs within the Type Allocation Code contained in the \<TAC\>
element with the serial number equal or greater than the serial number
contained in the \<Low-SNR\> element and less than or equal to the
serial number contained in the \<High-SNR\> element.

If no \<SNR\> element nor \<SNR-range\> element is included within the
\<IMEI-range\> element then the SEAL UE configuration document applies
to all the VAL UE(s) with the Type Allocation Code contained within the
\<TAC\> element of the \<IMEI-range\> element.

If no \<VAL-UE-id\> element is included then the SEAL UE configuration
document applies to all VAL UEs of the VAL service identified in the
\"domain\" attribute.

The VAL service may further extend the \<Common\> element of the
\<seal-UE-configuration\> to include VAL service specific common UE
configuration.

The VAL service may further extend the \<on-network\> element of the
\<seal-UE-configuration\> to include VAL service specific UE
configuration for on-network features.

### 7.2.6 MIME type

The MIME type for VAL user profile configuration shall be set to
\"vnd.3gpp.seal-ue-config-info+xml\".
