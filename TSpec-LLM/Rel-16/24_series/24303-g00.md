4.1 Mobility management based on Dual-Stack Mobile IPv6
-------------------------------------------------------

DSMIPv6 is specified in IETF RFC 6275 \[27\] and IETF RFC 5555 \[2\].
The purpose of the DSMIPv6 procedures is to establish, manage and tear
down a mobility tunnel between the UE and the HA function. The mobility
tunnel establishment is always initiated by the UE, while the mobility
tunnel tear down can be initiated either by the UE or the network.
Communication between the UE and a correspondent node shall use the
bidirectional mode of operation. Route optimization mode of operation is
not supported by EPC in this release.

In this specification, the IETF RFC 4877 \[4\] is used to secure DSMIPv6
signalling. For this purpose, the UE performs an IKEv2 exchange with the
HA before establishing the mobility tunnel as described in
subclause 5.1.2.2. The details of the security aspects are specified in
3GPP TS 33.402 \[18\].

The mobility tunnel procedures are performed by the UE for each PDN
connection, meaning that if multiple PDNs are accessed by the UE,
multiple instances of the procedures are needed. The multiple PDN
connections behaviour is specified more in detail in subclause 4.3.

In this specification, the IETF RFC 3963 \[29\] is used for prefix
preservation. For this purpose, the UE uses the implicit mode as stated
in IETF RFC 3963 \[29\] to tell the HA that the home network prefix
would be preserved during mobility. The support of this operation is
limited to the sending and receiving of IPv6 packets containing IPv6
addresses auto-configured from the home network prefix, in addition to
the IPv6 Home Address.

In this specification, the IETF RFC 5648 \[31\], IETF RFC 6089 \[32\]
and IETF RFC 6088 \[33\] are used for IFOM. The general principles of
IFOM are listed in 3GPP TS 23.261 \[34\]. For this purpose, the UE can
decide if IFOM is to be applied to a PDN connection. The procedures used
by the UE to determine which PDN connection IFOM is to be applied and
how the IP flows are distributed are specified in 3GPP TS 24.302 \[21\].

4.2 Identities
--------------

The UE shall use Network Access Identifier (NAI) as identification
towards the HA in the IKEv2 exchange. During this process, the IPsec
security association between the UE and the HA is tied to the user
identity, set to the NAI, and to an SPI uniquely identifying this
security association. The NAI is structured according to
3GPP TS 23.003 \[17\]. The NAI can be either a root NAI, a fast
re-authentication NAI or pseudonym identity as specified in
3GPP TS 23.003 \[17\].

The UE shall use the HA-APN to identify the desired HA in the DNS-based
and DHCPv6-based HA discovery procedures. The HA-APN is constructed
according to 3GPP TS 23.003 \[17\].

NOTE: The operator is responsible to configure the DNS system so that
the same PDN GW can be discovered via HA-APN and APN. A possible way of
configuring the mapping between HA-APN and APN is to create the HA-APN
from the respective APN by using the same Network Identifier and by
adding the prefix \"ha-apn\" to the Operator Identifier.

The Binding Update and Binding Acknowledgement shall not explicitly
carry an NAI as the IPsec security association is tied to the user
identity.

4.3 Multiple PDN connectivity
-----------------------------

This specification supports multiple PDN connectivity. The UE can setup
multiple PDN connections with a given APN or multiple APNs using
multiple DSMIPv6 sessions. There is one DSMIPv6 session per each PDN
connection.

NOTE: When a UE is associated to multiple PDN connections, it is
possible for the UE to create a tunnel loop amongst the HAs by binding
home addresses to each other. This results in the possibility of HA
being flooded with packets. Packet flooding is not specific to DSMIPv6
and there exist current implementations to deal with the packet flooding
issue. As for the formation of tunnel loop, the solution to solve it in
this current specification (Release 9) is implementation specific until
a standardized solution emerges.

The procedures described in clause 5 shall be interpreted as procedures
which are executed for each PDN connection the UE established. This
implies that:

\- For the initial attachment of a PDN connection, the UE shall perform
a Home Agent address discovery (subclause 5.1.2.1), a security
association establishment via IKEv2, including the EAP-AKA
authentication and the IPv6 Home Network Prefix assignment
(subclause 5.1.2.2), and the initial binding registration
(subclause 5.1.2.4).

\- The handover procedure shall be performed for each PDN connection
separately as described in subclause 5.2.2.

\- The re-registration procedure shall be performed for each PDN
connection separately as described in subclause 5.3.2.

\- The detach procedure shall be performed for each PDN connection
separately as described in subclause 5.4.2 or in subclause 5.4.3.

In addition to the above procedures, the following procedures described
for an IFOM capable UE configured for IFOM shall be interpreted as
procedures which are executed for each PDN connection that the UE has
decided to apply the IFOM procedures. This implies that:

\- The attach to additional access network procedure, as described in
subclause 5.6.2, shall be performed by the UE separately for each PDN
connection to which the access is to be the added.

\- The inter-access flow mobility procedure, as described in
subclause 5.7.2, shall be performed by the UE separately for each PDN
connection when IP flows are to be moved amongest access networks.

\- The removal of an access network procedure, as described in
subclause 5.8.2, shall be performed by the UE separately for each PDN
connection using the access network to be removed.

5 Dual-Stack Mobile IPv6 Procedures
===================================

5.1 Dual-Stack Mobile IPv6 initial attach
-----------------------------------------

### 5.1.1 General

The DSMIPv6 initial attach is performed by the UE to establish a DSMIPv6
connection with the node acting as HA. This is also known as the
bootstrapping procedure as the UE establishes the security association
with the HA. The initial attach involves the following tasks:

**- Discovery of the Home Agent address**. The UE needs to discover the
IPv6 address as well as the IPv4 address of the HA.

**- Security association establishment**. The UE needs to establish an
IPsec security association with the HA in order to secure the DSMIPv6
signalling. IKEv2 (IETF RFC 4877 \[4\]) is used to establish this
security association.

**- IPv6 Home Network Prefix assignment**. The UE needs to be assigned
an IPv6 Network Prefix of its home network in order to configure the
global unicast Home Address to be used in DSMIPv6. The HA is responsible
of assigning the IPv6 Home Network Prefix to the UE.

**- IPv4 Home Address assignment**. Optionally, a dual-stack UE can also
request to be assigned an IPv4 Home Address to be used for IPv4-only
applications. The HA is responsible of assigning the IPv4 Home Address
to the UE.

**- Home link detection**. The UE needs to perform Home Link Detection
before initiate registration with the HA. The DSMIPv6 Home Link
Detection Function is used by the UE to detect if it is attached to the
home link from a DSMIPv6 perspective.

**- Initial binding registration**. Unless the home link detection
procedure indicates the UE is at home, the UE sends a Binding Update
message to perform its initial registration with the HA.

If the UE is an IFOM capable UE the DSMIPv6 initial attach involves also
the IFOM capability discovery.

If the UE requires additional configuration parameters, e.g.
Vendor-specific options, stateless DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 as defined in
IETF RFC 4039 \[26\] and IETF RFC 3736 \[13\] can be run over the
DSMIPv6 tunnel.

### 5.1.2 UE procedures

#### 5.1.2.1 Discovery of the Home Agent address

##### 5.1.2.1.1 General

The first procedure the UE needs to perform for DSMIPv6 initial attach
is the discovery of the node acting as the HA.

The UE can discover the IP addresses of the HA in one of the four
following ways:

\- via DNS;

\- via attach procedure for 3GPP access or trusted non-3GPP access (if
supported) based on protocol configuration options;

\- via IKEv2 during tunnel setup to ePDG for untrusted non-3GPP
accesses;

\- via DHCPv6.

If the UE does not obtain the IP addresses of the HA via PCO during the
3GPP or trusted non-3GPP (if supported) attach or via IKEv2 signalling,
it shall follow either the procedures described in subclause 5.1.2.1.5
or the procedures described in subclause 5.1.2.1.2. The UE may be
configured to perform both procedures in parallel or one of the two
procedures only in case the other failed.

##### 5.1.2.1.2 Home agent address discovery based on DNS

A UE performing Home Agent discovery based on DNS shall support the
implementation of standard DNS mechanisms.

The UE shall perform DNS Lookup by Home Agent Name as specified in
IETF RFC 5026 \[10\].The QNAME shall be set to the requested HA-APN. The
HA-APN shall be constructed as specified in 3GPP TS 23.003 \[17\]. If a
HA has both an IPv4 and an IPv6 address, the corresponding DNS record
should be configured with both \'AAAA\' and \'A\' records. Accordingly
the UE should perform one DNS lookup procedure to retrieve both \'AAAA\'
and \'A\' records. The DNS server replies with one \'AAAA\' and one
\'A\' record.

##### 5.1.2.1.3 Home agent address discovery based on protocol configuration options

The UE may request the IPv6 address and optionally the IPv4 address of
the dual stack HA using the Protocol configuration options IE during the
attach procedure for 3GPP or trusted non-3GPP access or the additional
PDN connectivity procedure. The details of this procedure for the case
of attach for 3GPP access are described in 3GPP TS 24.301 \[15\]. The
details of this procedure for the case of attach for trusted non-3GPP
access are described in 3GPP TS 24.302 \[21\].

##### 5.1.2.1.4 Home agent address discovery based on IKEv2 signalling

The UE may request the IPv6 and optionally the IPv4 address of the HA
during the tunnel establishment procedure with the ePDG. The details of
this procedure are described in 3GPP TS 24.302 \[21\].

##### 5.1.2.1.5 Home agent address discovery based on DHCPv6

The HA address discovery via DHCPv6 is possible in the following cases:

\- in 3GPP access, or

\- in trusted non-3GPP access, when a DHCPv6 relay exists in the trusted
non-3GPP access and the PDN GW is the DHCPv6 server, or

\- in trusted non-3GPP access, when the DHCPv6 server is in the trusted
non-3GPP access and it has the HA addresse information from static
configuration, or received via STa reference point as specified in
3GPP TS 29.273 \[20\].

A UE performing HA discovery based on DHCPv6 shall support the
implementation of stateless DHCPv6 as specified in IETF RFC 3736 \[13\]
and the DHCPv6 options as specified in IETF RFC 6610 \[12\].

In order to discover the address of the HA the UE shall send an
Information-Request message including the \"MIP6 Home Network ID FQDN
Option\" as described in IETF RFC 6610 \[12\].

In order to connect to a HA for a specific target PDN, the UE shall
include the desired HA-APN in the Home Network Identification FQDN field
contained in the \"MIP6 Home Network ID FQDN Option\" as described in
IETF RFC 6610 \[12\].

NOTE: The new options described in IETF RFC 6610 \[12\] are applicable
to DSMIPv6.

The HA information is provided to the UE as described in
IETF RFC 6610 \[12\] in the sub-option contained in the \"MIP6
Identified Home Network Information Option\". The sub-option can be:

\- a \"MIP6 Home Agent Address Network Information Option\" (the IPv6
address and if available, the IPv4 address of the HA); or

\- a \"MIP6 Home Agent FQDN Network Information Option\" (the HA FQDN)
as described in IETF RFC 6610 \[12\].

In the latter case the UE shall perform a DNS Lookup by Home Agent Name
as specified in IETF RFC 5026 \[10\]. The QNAME shall be set to the
received HA FQDN.

If a HA has both an IPv4 and an IPv6 address, the corresponding DNS
record should be configured with both \'AAAA\' and \'A\' records.
Accordingly the UE should perform one DNS lookup procedure to retrieve
both \'AAAA\' and \'A\' records. The DNS server replies with one
\'AAAA\' and one \'A\' record.

#### 5.1.2.1a IFOM capability discovery

An IFOM capable UE shall perform HA IFOM capability discovery, i.e. an
IFOM capable UE shall discover whether the HA supports IFOM or not. The
HA IFOM capability can be performed using the following methods:

\- as part of attach procedure for 3GPP access based on protocol
configuration options;

\- as part of a IKEv2 tunnel setup procedure with the HA; or

\- using the information received from ANDSF.

The IFOM capable UE shall support HA IFOM capability discovery performed
through IKEv2 tunnel setup procedure. The HA IFOM capability discovery
performed within IKEv2 tunnel setup procedure with the HA is described
in subclause 5.1.2.2.

If the IFOM capable UE supports IPv6 Home Network Prefix assignment via
PCO, the IFOM capable UE shall support HA IFOM capability discovery via
PCO.

The IFOM capable UE may use inter system routing policies (see
3GPP TS 24.302 \[21\] and 3GPP TS 24.312 \[36\]) to perform the HA IFOM
capability discovery for a specific APN. If the IFOM capable UE uses
inter system routing policies to perform HA IFOM capability discovery,
the UE may skip performing the HA IFOM capability discovery via PCO or
the HA IFOM capability discovery via IKEv2.

#### 5.1.2.2 Security association establishment and IPv6 Home Network Prefix assignment

The UE shall support the IKEv2 protocol (see IETF RFC 5996 \[14\]) for
negotiating the IPsec security association to secure DSMIPv6 signalling
and shall support EAP over IKEv2 as described in IETF RFC 5996 \[14\] to
perform authentication with an AAA server. In a case an additional
authentication and authorization of the IPSec security association is
needed with an external AAA server, then the additional authentication
steps during the IKEv2 exchange shall be supported as specified in
IETF RFC 4739 \[23\] and the UE shall follow the WLAN UE procedure
described in 3GPP TS 33.234 \[24\].

The UE shall support IPsec ESP (see IETF RFC 4303 \[11\]) in order to
provide authentication of Binding Update and Binding Acknowledgement
messages as specified in IETF RFC 4877 \[4\]. The UE shall support
multiple authentication exchanges in the IKEv2 protocol as specified in
IETF RFC 4739 \[23\] in order to support authentication with an external
AAA server. The UE shall support the redirect mechanism as defined in
IETF RFC 5685 \[30\].

The UE shall initiate the security association establishment procedure
by sending the IKE\_SA\_INIT request message defined in
IETF RFC 5996 \[14\] to the HA. The UE shall indicate support for the HA
reallocation by including a REDIRECT\_SUPPORTED payload in the
IKE\_SA\_INIT request as specified in IETF RFC 5685\[30\]. On receipt of
an IKE\_SA\_INIT response, the UE shall send an IKE\_AUTH request
message including the MN-NAI in the IDi payload and the Access Point
Name (APN) of the target PDN the UE wants to connect to in the IDr
payload. The APN shall be formatted as defined in 3GPP TS 23.003 \[17\].
The username part of the MN-NAI included in \"IDi\" payload may be an
IMSI, pseudonym or re-authentication ID. The UE shall include in the IDi
payload the same MN-NAI it includes in the EAP-Response/Identity within
the EAP-AKA exchange.

In the very first EAP-Response/Identity within the IKEv2 exchange the UE
shall include a NAI whose username is derived from IMSI. In subsequent
exchanges the UE should use pseudonyms and re-authentication identities
provided by the 3GPP AAA server as specified in IETF RFC 4187 \[28\].

NOTE: Fast re‑authentication mechanism is optional, and therefore is an
implementation option in the UE and operator configuration issue (i.e.
it also depends on whether the AAA server sent a re-authentication ID
during previous EAP authentication) whether to use it during security
association establishment.

EAP-AKA over IKEv2 shall be used to authenticate UE in the IKE\_AUTH
exchange, while public key signature based authentication with
certificates shall be used to authenticate the HA.

During the IKEv2 exchange, the HA may trigger the UE to perform the HA
reallocation procedure. If the UE receives as part of the IKE\_AUTH
response message a REDIRECT payload containing the IP address of a
target HA as specified in subclause 5.1.3.1, the UE shall initiate a new
IKEv2 security association with the target HA. The UE shall terminate
the IKEv2 security association with the initial HA by sending an IKEv2
Informational message with a DELETE payload as specified in
IETF RFC 5996 \[14\].

During the IKEv2 exchange, the UE shall request the allocation of an
IPv6 home prefix through the Configuration Payload in the IKE\_AUTH
request message. Since in EPS a unique IPv6 prefix is assigned to the
UE, the UE shall include a MIP6\_HOME\_PREFIX attribute in the
CFG\_REQUEST payload of the IKE\_AUTH request message as described in
IETF RFC 5026 \[10\]. In addition the UE may include the
INTERNAL\_IP6\_DNS attribute in the CFG\_REQUEST as described in
IETF RFC 5996 \[14\] to request the DNS server IPv6 address of the PLMN
it is connecting to via DSMIPv6. In the same way the UE may include the
INTERNAL\_IP4\_DNS attribute in the CFG\_REQUEST payload to request the
IPv4 address of the DNS server.

During the IKEv2 exchange, if the UE receives an IKE\_AUTH response
message containing a Notify Payload with a Private Notify Message Type
MAX\_CONNECTION\_REACHED as specified in 3GPP TS 24.302 \[21\], the UE
shall close the related IKEv2 security association states. As long as
none of existing IKEv2 security association is released, the UE shall
not attempt to establish any additional IKEv2 security association.

The UE shall then auto-configure a Home Address from the IPv6 prefix
received from the HA and shall run a CREATE\_CHILD\_SA exchange to
create the security association for the new Home Address. In the
CREATE\_CHILD\_SA exchange the UE shall include the Home Address and the
appropriate selectors in the TSi (Traffic Selector-initiator) payload to
negotiate the IPsec security association for protecting the Binding
Update and Binding Acknowledgement messages as specified in
IETF RFC 4877 \[4\].

If the UE knows the IPv6 Home Network Prefix of a PDN connection for
which the security association is to be setup, the UE shall insert a PDN
Identifier notify payload, as defined in annex B, in the IKE\_AUTH
request message. The PDN Identifier notify payload shall contain the
IPv6 Home Network Prefix of the PDN connection for which the security
association is being set up. If the UE does not know the IPv6 Home
Network Prefix of the PDN connection for which the security association
is to be set up, the UE shall not include the PDN Identifier notify
payload in the IKE\_AUTH request message.

If an IFOM capable UE performs HA IFOM capability discovery via IKEv2
procedure, the IFOM capable UE shall include the IFOM Capability notify
payload (as specified in the Annex B.2) in the IKE\_SA\_INIT request
message to perform HA IFOM capability discovery. If the IFOM capable UE
receives in the IKE\_SA\_INIT response message the IFOM Capability
notify payload, the IFOM capable UE shall behave as an IFOM capable UE
configured for IFOM as the received payload indicates that the HA
supports IFOM. If the IFOM capable UE does not receive in the
IKE\_SA\_INIT response message the IFOM Capability notify payload, the
IFOM capable UE shall behave as a UE which is not IFOM capable as the
received payload indicates that the HA does not support IFOM.

#### 5.1.2.3 Home Link Detection

The DSMIPv6 Home Link Detection Function is used by the UE to detect if
an access interface is on the home link for a PDN connection from a
DSMIPv6 perspective. The Home Link Detection function shall be performed
before sending DSMIPv6 Binding Update via the same access interface.

To perform the Home Link Detection procedure, the UE shall compare the
assigned Home Network Prefix for a PDN connection with the IPv6 prefix
or prefixes included in the Prefix Information Option in the Router
Advertisements received on the local link. The Home Network Prefix can
be assigned in a 3GPP access via PCO, as specified in
3GPP TS 24.301 \[15\], or via IKEv2 as specified in subclause 5.1.2.2.
If there is a match between the Home Network Prefix and one of the local
prefixes, the UE is attached on the home link over the respective access
interface and shall not send a Binding Update to the HA unless the UE
currently has a valid DSMIPv6 Binding Update list entry. If the UE has a
valid DSMIPv6 Binding Update list entry, the UE shall proceed to perform
the action specified in subclause 5.2.2.4. If there is not any match,
the UE shall proceed as specified in subclause 5.1.2.4.

NOTE: The UE does not need to run IKEv2 for home link detection if the
Home Network prefix is dynamically received in a PCO Information
Element.

If the IFOM capable UE performs the Home Network Prefix assignment via
Protocol Configuration Option, the IFOM capable UE shall perform in the
PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message both Home Network Prefix assignment and
the IFOM capability discovery.

#### 5.1.2.4 Initial binding registration and IPv4 Home Address assignment

After establishing the security association and obtaining the IPv6 Home
Address, the UE shall send a Binding Update message as specified in
IETF RFC 6275 \[27\] and IETF RFC 5555 \[2\] in order to register its
Home Address and Care-of Address at the HA, if it detects it is in the
foreign network.

If both IPv4 and IPv6 Care-of Address are received at the foreign
network, the UE shall first attempt to use the IPv6 Care-of Address for
its binding registration.

If IPv6 Care-of Address is used for initial binding registration, the UE
shall send the Binding Update message to the IPv6 address of the HA. In
this Binding Update message the H (home registration) and A
(acknowledge) bits shall be set. If the UE needs an IPv4 Home Address,
the UE shall include the 0.0.0.0 address in the IPv4 Home Address option
to request a dynamic IPv4 Home Address.

When IPv6 Care-of Address is used for initial binding registration, the
Alternate Care-of Address option shall be used by the UE to carry the
Care-of Address inside a Mobility Header which is protected by ESP. If
this option is present, the address included in this option is the same
address present in the source address of the IPv6 packet. The Alternate
Care-of Address option shall not be included if a BID mobility option is
added in the same Binding Update message.

If IPv4 Care-of Address is used for initial binding registration, the UE
shall send the Binding Update as follows (see IETF RFC 5555 \[2\]):

\- The IPv6 packet, with the IPv6 Home Address as the Source Address
field of the IPv6 header, shall be encapsulated in UDP.

\- The UE shall include the IPv4 Care-of Address as the Source Address
field of the IPv4 header and the HA IPv4 address as the Destination
Address field of the IPv4 header.

\- The UE shall include the IPv4 Care-of Address option containing the
IPv4 Care-of Address. The IPv4 Care-of Address option shall not be
included if a BID mobility option is added in the same Binding Update
message.

\- The UE shall set the H (home registration) and A (acknowledge) flags.

\- The UE shall set the F (UDP encapsulation required) flag to 0.

\- The UE shall set the R (Mobile Router Flag) flag to 1.

\- If the UE needs an IPv4 Home Address, the UE shall include an IPv4
Home Address option with the 0.0.0.0 address in the Binding Update
message, as defined in IETF RFC 5555 \[2\].

If the UE is an IFOM capable UE configured for IFOM, the UE extends the
Binding Update with the following options:

a\) The UE shall set the O (Overwrite) flag to \"1\";

b\) The UE shall include a BID identifier mobility option in the Binding
Update as specified in IETF RFC 5648 \[31\];

\- The UE shall set the BID-PRI field to assign the priority to the BID
as indicated in IETF RFC 6089 \[32\]; and

c\) The UE may create one or more routing rules with the HA. For each
routing rule that the UE wants to register with the HA, the UE shall
include a FID mobility option containing one traffic selector as
specified in IETF RFC 6089 \[32\].

\- The FID field shall be set to an arbitrary value;

\- The FID-PRI field shall be set to the assigned priority of the FID as
indicated in IETF RFC 6089 \[32\];

\- A Binding Reference suboption shall be included as defined in
IETF RFC 6089 \[32\]. As indicated in IETF RFC 6089 \[32\] the value
assigned to the BID is the same included in the BID mobility option
included in the Binding Update; and

\- Traffic selector suboption shall be set as specified in
IETF RFC 6089 \[32\] and IETF RFC 6088 \[33\]. The parameters described
in the traffic selector suboption represent the routing filter that
corresponds to the routing rule that the UE wants to register with the
HA.

According to IETF RFC 6089 \[32\], traffic selector suboption contains
parameters identifying downlink traffic, hence routing rules registered
with the HA bind either a Care-of Address or a Home Address to the
downlink traffic. The same bound IP address shall be used by the IFOM
capable UE configured for IFOM to route the corresponding uplink traffic
(i.e. asymmetrical routing is not allowed in this version of the
specification).

When the UE receives the Binding Acknowledgement from the HA, it shall
validate it based on the rules described in IETF RFC 6275 \[27\] and
IETF RFC 5555 \[2\]. If the Binding Acknowledgement contains the
successful status code 0 (\"Binding Update Accepted\"), the UE shall
create an entry for the registered Home Address in its Binding Update
List and may start sending packets containing its IPv6 Home Address or
other IPv6 addresses auto-configured from the assigned home network
prefix.

If the Binding Acknowledgement contains a value of 128, the UE may
re-send the BU as specified in IETF RFC 6275 \[27\]. If the Binding
Acknowledgement contains a value from 129 to 133 as specified in
IETF RFC 6275 \[27\] or a value from 140 to 143 as specified in
IETF RFC 3963 \[29\], the UE shall not send the BU to the HA and should
discover another HA.

If the Binding Acknowledgment contains an IPv4 Address Acknowledgement
option with status code value from 0 to 127 (indicating success), the UE
shall create two entries in its Binding Update List, one for the IPv6
Home Address and another for the IPv4 Home Address. If the Binding
Acknowledgement contains an IPv4 Address Acknowledgment option with
status code indicating error (i.e. 128 or higher), the UE shall create
an entry only for the IPv6 HoA in its binding update list. Moreover, if
the status code is 129 (\"Administratively prohibited\") or 132
(\"Dynamic IPv4 home address assignment not available\"), the UE shall
not re-send the Binding Update and it shall use only the IPv6 HoA. If
the Binding Acknowledgement contains an IPv4 Address Acknowledgement
option with status 128 (\"Failure, reason unspecified\"), 130
(\"Incorrect IPv4 home address\"), 131 (\"Invalid IPv4 address\") or 133
(\"Prefix allocation unauthorized\") it shall re-send the Binding Update
including the 0.0.0.0 address in the IPv4 Home Address option. If the
Binding Acknowledgement does not contain an IPv4 Address Acknowledgment
option, the UE shall create an entry only for the IPv6 HoA in its
binding update list.

NOTE 1: The value to be used to identify the IPv4 address
acknowledgement option in the mobility header is 30;

If the Binding Acknowledgment contains a BID mobility option, the UE
shall process it as specified in IETF RFC 5648 \[31\]. If the Binding
Acknowledgment contains one or more flow mobility options, the UE shall
process it as specified in IETF RFC 6089 \[32\].

If the status field of the BID mobility option is set to zero, the IFOM
capable UE configured for IFOM applies to every examined BID option the
status code contained in the status field of the Binding Acknowledgement
message as indicated in IETF RFC 5648 \[31\]. If the value of the status
field assigned to a BID mobility option is equal to 4 (\"MCOA
NOTCOMPLETE\"), 164 (\"MCOA MALFORMED\"), 165 (\"MCOA NON-MCOA\") or 167
(\"MCOA UNKOWN COA\"), the IFOM capable UE configured for IFOM performs
the operations described in IETF RFC 5648 \[31\].

NOTE 2: the above error cases, e.g. 165 (\"MCOA NON-MCOA BINDING
EXISTS\"), that do not apply to the case of initial attach can apply to
other use cases (e.g. attach to additional access).

When processing a FID mobility option, if the value of the status field
of the FID mobility option is 129 (\"Flow binding rejected\"), 130
(\"Flow identification mobility option malformed\"), 131 (\"BID not
found\") or 132 (\"FID not found\"), the IFOM capable UE configured for
IFOM performs the operations described in IETF RFC 6089 \[32\].

The UE may then send data traffic either with the IPv6 Home Address or
with the IPv4 Home Address. If the UE is located on an IP6-enabled link,
it shall send IPv6 packets as described in IETF RFC 6275 \[27\]; IPv4
traffic shall be encapsulated in IPv6 packets as described in
IETF RFC 5555 \[2\]. If the UE is located on an IPv4-only link and the
Binding Acknowledgement contains the NAT detection option with the F
flag set, the UE shall send IPv6 and IPv4 packets following the vanilla
UDP encapsulation rules specified in IETF RFC 5555 \[2\]. Otherwise the
UE shall send IPv6 and IPv4 packets encapsulated in IPv4 as specified in
IETF RFC 5555 \[2\].

Once the DSMIPv6 tunnel is established, the UE may build a DHCPv4 or
DHCPv6 message as described in IETF RFC 4039 \[26\] or
IETF RFC 3736 \[13\] respectively and send it via the DSMIPv6 tunnel as
described in IETF RFC 6275 \[27\] in order to retrieve additional
parameters, e.g. Vendor-specific options. The UE may also request
additional IPv6 prefix(es) with length of /64 or shorter by using DHCPv6
Prefix Delegation as defined in IETF RFC 6276 \[35\].

### 5.1.3 HA procedures

#### 5.1.3.1 Security association establishment and IPv6 Home Network Prefix assignment

The HA shall support the IKEv2 protocol (see IETF RFC 5996 \[14\]) for
negotiating the IPsec security association to secure DSMIPv6 signalling
and shall support EAP over IKEv2 as described in IETF RFC 5996 \[14\] to
perform UE authentication with an AAA server. If an additional
authentication and authorization of the IPSec security association were
needed with an external AAA server, then the additional authentication
steps during the IKEv2 exchange shall be supported as specified in
IETF RFC 4739 \[23\] and the HA shall follow the PDG procedure defined
in 3GPP TS 33.234 \[24\].

The HA shall support IPsec ESP (see IETF RFC 4303 \[11\]) in order to
provide authentication of Binding Update and Binding Acknowledgement
messages as specified in IETF RFC 4877 \[4\]. The HA shall support
multiple authentication exchanges in the IKEv2 protocol as specified in
IETF RFC 4739 \[23\] in order to support authentication with an external
AAA server.

The HA shall complete the IKE\_SA\_INIT exchange as specified in
IETF RFC 5996 \[14\]. The HA shall include in the IDr the same value
included by the UE in the IDr payload of the request.

Upon successful authorization and authentication, the HA shall accept
the security association establishment request by sending the IKE\_AUTH
response message with the CFG\_REPLY payload including the IPv6 Home
Network Prefix allocated to the UE in the MIP6\_HOME\_PREFIX attribute.
This prefix information shall include the prefix length as specified in
IETF RFC 5026 \[10\]. If the UE included the INTERNAL\_IP6\_DNS or the
INTERNAL\_IP4\_DNS in the CFG\_REQUEST payload, the HA shall include the
same attribute in the CFG\_REPLY payload including zero or more DNS
server addresses as specified in IETF RFC 5996 \[14\].

If the HA needs to reject a IKEv2 security association establishment due
to the network policies or capabilities to indicate that no more IKEv2
security association establishment request with any APN can be accepted
for the UE, the HA shall include in the IKE\_AUTH response message
containing the IDr payload a Notify Payload with a Private Notify
Message Type MAX\_CONNECTION\_REACHED as specified in
3GPP TS 24.302 \[21\].

If the UE included a PDN Identifier notify payload within the IKE\_AUTH
request message, the HA may apply the following procedure:

1\) Process the PDN Identifier notify payload according to
IETF RFC 5996 \[14\]; and

2\) Use the IPv6 prefix contained in the payload to identify the PDN
connection for which the security association is being set up and

\- if the HA is able to identify the PDN connection for which the
security association is being set up, the HA shall insert the previously
assigned IPv6 Home Network Prefix in the MIP6\_HOME\_PREFIX attribute in
the CFG\_REPLY payload; or

\- if the HA is not able to identify the PDN connection for which the
security association is being set up, the HA shall ignore the content of
the received PDN Identifier notify payload and allocate an IPv6 Home
Network Prefix as described below.

When allocating an IPv6 Home Network Prefix, the HA shall apply one of
the following procedures:

\- If the IKEv2 message is received over an existing PDN connection, the
assigned IPv6 network prefix of the PDN connection shall be sent to the
UE as IPv6 Home Network Prefix in the MIP6\_HOME\_PREFIX attribute; or,

\- If the IKEv2 message is not received over an existing PDN connection,
and the UE has an existing PDN connection which has no IPSec security
association established, the assigned IPv6 network prefix of the PDN
connection shall be sent to the UE as IPv6 Home Network Prefix in the
MIP6\_HOME\_PREFIX attribute; or,

\- If the IKEv2 message is not received over an existing PDN connection,
and the UE does not have an existing PDN connection which has no IPSec
security association established, a new IPv6 network prefix shall be
allocated and sent to the UE as IPv6 Home Network Prefix in the
MIP6\_HOME\_PREFIX attribute.

An IFOM capable Home Agent shall implement the IFOM Capability notify
payload. If the UE included the IFOM Capability notify payload within
the IKE\_SA\_INIT request message, the HA shall perform the following
procedures:

\- process the IFOM Capability notify payload according to
IETF RFC 5996 \[14\];

\- if the HA is IFOM capable, the HA includes the IFOM Capability notify
payload in the IKE\_SA\_INIT response message; and

\- if the HA is not IFOM capable, the HA ignores the IFOM Capability
notify payload received from the UE and in the IKE\_SA\_INIT response
message will not include the IFOM Capability notify payload.

If the 3GPP AAA server triggers the HA to perform a HA reallocation
procedure as specified in 3GPP TS 33.402 \[18\], the HA learns the IP
address of the target HA as specified in 3GPP TS 29.273 \[20\]. The HA
shall provide to the UE the target HA IP address in the REDIRECT payload
during IKE\_AUTH exchange as specified in 3GPP TS 33.402 \[18\]. The
encoding of the REDIRECT payload in the IKE\_AUTH response message is
specified in IETF RFC 5685 \[30\]. The HA shall not assign an IPv6
prefix to the UE in the IKE\_AUTH exchange. The HA shall remove the
states of the IKEv2 security association with the UE after receiving an
IKEv2 Informational message with a DELETE payload from the UE.

#### 5.1.3.2 Initial binding registration and IPv4 Home Address assignment

When the HA receives a Binding Update message from the UE, it shall
validate it as described in IETF RFC 6275 \[27\] and in
IETF RFC 5555 \[2\]. If the Alternate Care-of Address option is present,
the HA shall verify the correctness of the Alternate Care-of Address
option. If the Care-of Address specified in the Alternate Care-of
Address option and in the Source Address field of the IPv6 header of the
Binding Update packet are different, the HA shall reject the request by
returning a Binding Acknowledgement with status code 128. If the HA
accepts the Binding Update message, it shall create a new entry in its
binding cache for UE, marking it as a home registration. The lifetime of
this binding cache entry is set based on operator\'s policies. The HA
shall not perform a Duplicate Address Detection on the IPv6 Home Address
of the UE because of the uniqueness of the IPv6 prefix assigned by the
HA to the UE. Then the HA shall send a Binding Acknowledgement with R
bit set to \"1\" as specified in IETF RFC 6275 \[27\] and
IETF RFC 3963 \[29\]. The HA may include the Binding Refresh Advice
mobility option following rules defined in IETF RFC 6275 \[27\] to
indicate the remaining time until the UE should send a new home binding
update.

If the Binding Update contains an IPv4 Home Address option with the
0.0.0.0 IPv4 address, the HA shall assign an IPv4 Home Address to the
UE, including an IPv4 Address Acknowledgement option in the Binding
Acknowledgement message, as specified in IETF RFC 5555 \[2\]. If no IPv4
addresses are available at the HA, the HA shall send a Binding
Acknowledgement with status code 132 in the IPv4 address acknowledgement
option.

If in the received Binding Update the IPv4 Care-of Address in the IPv4
Care-of Address option is not the same as the IPv4 address in the Source
Address in the outer IPv4 header then a NAT was in the path. This
information shall be included in the Binding Acknowledgement within a
NAT Detection option with the F flag set and the Binding Acknowledgement
shall be encapsulated based on the vanilla UDP encapsulation specified
in IETF RFC 5555 \[2\].

If a NAT was not detected, the HA shall send the Binding Acknowledgement
without any UDP encapsulation; the message shall be encapsulated in an
IPv4 header if the Care-of Address is IPv4 or in an IPv6 header if the
Care-of Address is IPv6 as specified in IETF RFC 5555 \[2\].

If the Binding Update contains a BID mobility option, the HA shall
process it as specified in IETF RFC 5648 \[31\]. If one or more FID
mobility options are included in the received Binding Update, the HA
shall process it as specified in IETF RFC 6089 \[32\] and
IETF RFC 6088 \[33\]. If binding update is accepted and IP flow mobility
is supported, the HA shall insert the BID mobility option into the
Binding Acknowledgement message as specified in IETF RFC 5648 \[31\]. In
addition, if the received Binding Update contains FID mobility option,
the HA shall create the flow bindings accordingly and insert the FID
mobility option into the Binding Acknowledgement message as specified in
IETF RFC 6089 \[32\].

If the binding update is accepted for both IPv4 and IPv6 home addresses,
the HA creates two bindings, one for each home address as specified in
IETF RFC 5555 \[2\]. The HA shall link the IPv4 home address binding to
the IPv6 home address binding.

NOTE: How the linkage between the two bindings (e.g. separate or single
binding cache entry) is performed is implementation specific.

When the binding cache entry is created for the UE, the HA shall tunnel
all packets destined to the IPv6 Home Address, the home network prefix
and all packets destined to the IPv4 Home Address (if present) to the
UE\'s Care-of Address. If a NAT was detected, packets shall be
encapsulated in UDP and IPv4 based on vanilla UDP encapsulation
specified in IETF RFC 5555 \[2\]. If the Care-of Address is an IPv6
address, IPv4 and IPv6 packets shall be encapsulated in an IPv6 header
as specified in IETF RFC 6275 \[27\] and in IETF RFC 5555 \[2\];
otherwise, if the Care-of Address is an IPv4 address, IPv4 and IPv6
packets shall be encapsulated in an IPv4 header as specified in
IETF RFC 6275 \[27\] and in IETF RFC 5555 \[2\]. If the HA has multiple
binding cache entries with flow bindings (see 3GPP TS 23.261 \[34\]),
the HA shall route all packets destined to the IPv6 Home Address, the
home network prefix, the IPv6 prefix(es) assigned through DHCP prefix
delegation (if present) and all packets destined to the IPv4 Home
Address (if present) as described in IETF RFC 6089 \[32\].

After the DSMIPv6 tunnel is established, if DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation
request is received, the HA may assign additional IPv6 prefix(es) with
length of /64 or shorter to the UE as defined in IETF RFC 6276 \[35\].
Once the DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation procedure has been completed, the HA
shall add the assigned delegated prefix(es) into the binding cache entry
as defined in IETF RFC 6276 \[35\]. When the delegated prefix(es) is
included in the binding cache entry for UE, the HA shall tunnel all the
packets destined to the delegated prefix(es) to the UE\'s Care-of
Address.

#### 5.1.3.3 Binding Error message

When the HA receives a Binding Update and detects an unrecognized
Mobility Header, the HA shall send a Binding Error message with status
value 2 \"Unrecognized MH Type value\" as specified in
IETF RFC 6275 \[27\]. The HA shall include the Home address that was
contained in the Home Address destination option.

If NAT was not detected, the HA shall send the Binding Error without any
UDP encapsulation; the message shall be encapsulated in an IPv4 header
if the Care-of Address is IPv4 or in an IPv6 header if the Care-of
Address is IPv6 in the same manner as the Binding Acknowledgement
encapsulation specified in IETF RFC 5555 \[2\].

If NAT was detected, the HA shall send the Binding Error encapsulated in
UDP and IPv4 based on vanilla UDP encapsulation specified in
IETF RFC 5555 \[2\].

5.2 Dual-Stack Mobile IPv6 handover
-----------------------------------

### 5.2.1 General

The DSMIPv6 handover procedure is performed by the UE to update its
Care-of Address at the HA after a movement between two different
accesses (e.g. a movement from a 3GPP to a non-3GPP access). The
procedure is also used when the Care-of Address is changed for other
reasons (e.g. re-allocation of a local IP address or equivalent). When
this procedure takes place, the UE has already a valid registration at
the HA, which implies that the HA has an entry in its binding cache for
that UE and a security association to secure DSMIPv6 signalling is in
place between the UE and the HA.

The procedure involves performing the Home Link Detection, setup a
security association with the HA if there is no security association
existing, and the exchange of a Binding Update and a Binding
Acknowledgement between the UE and the HA. For the handover procedure,
at the previous access the UE shall already perform discovery of the HA
address, and may set up a security association with it, as these steps
are part of the initial attach procedure described in subclause 5.1.2.

There are different handover scenarios:

\- handover from home link to a foreign link;

\- handover from a foreign link to another foreign link; and

\- handover from a foreign link to a home link.

### 5.2.2 UE procedures

#### 5.2.2.1 General 

Following a change of access, the UE configures an IP address on the
target access system. The details of IP address configuration can be
access specific. The handling of the received Binding Acknowledgement is
the same as specified in subclause 5.1.2.4.

#### 5.2.2.2 Handover from home link to a foreign link

If the access network supports IPv6, as soon as the UE has received via
a Router Advertisement at least an IPv6 prefix which is not present in
its Prefix List, the UE shall perform the Home Link detection as
specified in subclause 5.1.2.3.

If the UE detects that it is moving from home link to foreign link, and
if there is no security association existing with the HA, the UE shall
perform the Security association establishment and Home Address
assignment procedure with the HA as specified in subclause 5.1.2.2.

Then the UE shall perform the initial binding registration and IPv4 Home
Address assignment as specified in subclause 5.1.2.4. In order to
maintain IP address preservation for the IPv4 address used in the home
link, the UE shall include the IPv4 address used on the home link in an
IPv4 Home Address option in the same Binding Update message. The IFOM
capable UE configured for IFOM shall extend the Binding Update message
as described in subclause 5.1.2.4.

If the UE does not have an IPv4 Home Address but wants to configure one,
the UE shall include the IPv4 Home Address option with the 0.0.0.0
address as specified in subclause 5.1.2.4.

If the access network supports only IPv4, as soon as the UE has
configured an IPv4 Care-of Address, the UE shall send a Binding Update
tunnelled in UDP as specified in IETF RFC 5555 \[2\]. The UE shall set
the F flag to \"0\". The UE shall set the R flag to \"1\".

Independent of an IPv6 or IPv4 access network the UE shall set the Key
Management Capability (K) bit in the Binding Update message.

If the UE receives, as response to an outstanding binding registration,
a binding acknowledgment having a status code equal to 135 (\"Sequence
number out of window\") and a sequence number different from the one
used in the outstanding binding registration, the UE shall accept the
binding acknowledgment and process it as specified in
IETF RFC 6275 \[27\].

#### 5.2.2.3 Handover from a foreign link to another foreign link

If the access network supports IPv6, as soon as the UE has received via
a Router Advertisement at least an IPv6 prefix which is not present in
its Prefix List, the UE shall perform the Home Link detection as
specified in subclause 5.1.2.3.

If the UE detects it is not attached to the home link, the UE shall send
a Binding Update to the HA including the newly configured IP address as
the Care-of Address in the Source IP address of the packet and
optionally in the Alternate Care-of Address Option IETF RFC 6275 \[27\].
The UE build the Binding Update message as specified in
IETF RFC 6275 \[27\].

If the UE has been assigned also an IPv4 Home Address and wants to
update also the binding for it, the UE shall include the IPv4 Home
Address option including the assigned IPv4 Home Address in the same
Binding Update message.

If the UE has been assigned also an IPv4 Home Address and wants to
release it, the UE shall not include any IPv4 Home Address option in the
same Binding Update.

If the UE does not have an IPv4 Home Address but wants to configure one,
the UE shall include the IPv4 Home Address option with the 0.0.0.0
address as specified in subclause 5.1.2.4.

If the access network supports only IPv4, as soon as the UE has
configured an IPv4 Care-of Address which is different from the previous
Care-of Address, the UE shall send a Binding Update tunnelled in UDP as
specified in IETF RFC 5555 \[2\]. The UE shall set the F flag to \"0\".
The UE shall set the R flag to \"1\".

Independent of an IPv6 or IPv4 access network the UE shall set the Key
Management Capability (K) bit in the Binding Update message.

If the UE is an IFOM capable UE configured for IFOM, the UE extends the
Binding Update with the following options:

a\) the UE shall set the O (Overwrite) flag to \"0\";

b\) the UE shall include a BID identifier mobility option in the Binding
Update as specified in IETF RFC 5648 \[31\];

\- the UE shall set the BID field to the value registered with the Home
Agent;

\- the UE shall set the BID-PRI field to assign the priority to the BID
as indicated in IETF RFC 6089 \[32\];

\- if the newly configured IP address used as Care-of Address is an IPv6
address, the UE shall not insert any Alternate Care-of Address option in
the Binding Update message;

\- if the newly configured IP address used as Care-of Address is an IPv4
address, the UE shall not insert any IPv4 Care-of Address option in the
Binding Update message; and

\- the UE shall insert the newly configured IP address used as Care-of
Address in the Care-of Address field of the BID identifier mobility
option insertd in the Binding Update message;

c\) the UE may create one or more routing rules. For each routing rule
that the UE wants to register with the HA, the UE shall include a FID
mobility option containing one traffic selector as specified in
IETF RFC 6089 \[32\]. Traffic selectors are defined in
IETF RFC 6088 \[33\]:

\- the UE shall set the FID field to an arbitrary value;

\- the UE shall set the FID-PRI field to assign the priority to the
routing filter as indicated in IETF RFC 6089 \[32\];

\- the UE shall include a Binding Reference suboption as indicated in
IETF RFC 6089 \[32\]. The value assigned to the BID identifies the
routing address that the UE wants to use to exchange the packets
matching the routing filters; and

\- traffic selector suboption shall be set as specified in
IETF RFC 6089 \[32\] and IETF RFC 6088 \[33\]. The parameters described
in the traffic selector suboption represent the routing filter that
corresponds to the routing rule that the UE wants to register with the
HA;

d\) The UE may insert a flow summary mobility option (as described in
IETF RFC 6089 \[32\]).

\- If the UE wants to keep some routing rules previously registered
unmodified, i.e. no flow handover, the UE lists the values of the FIDs
identifying the routing rules that the UE wants to keep unmodified in
the flow summary mobility option; and

\- If the UE wants to remove one or more previously registered routing
rules, the UE does not include in the flow summary mobility option the
FIDs identifying the routing rules that the UE wants to remove; and

e\) the UE may modify one or more routing rules with the HA. For each
routing rule that the UE wants to modify, the UE shall include a FID
mobility option as specified in IETF RFC 6089 \[32\].

\- the UE shall set the FID field to the value identifying the routing
filter the UE wants to handover;

\- the UE shall set the FID-PRI field to assign the priority to the BID
as indicated in IETF RFC 6089 \[32\]; and

\- the UE shall include a Binding Reference suboption as indicated in
IETF RFC 6089 \[32\]. The value assigned to the BID identifies the
routing address that the UE wants to use to exchange the packets
matching the routing filters.

The UE shall process the binding acknowledge message as described in
subclause 5.1.2.4.

#### 5.2.2.4 Handover from a foreign link to a home link

If the access network supports IPv6, as soon as the UE has received via
a Router Advertisement message at least an IPv6 prefix which is not
present in its Prefix List, the UE shall perform the Home Link detection
as specified in subclause 5.1.2.3 to detect if the UE is attaching to
the home link. If the UE detects it is attached to the home link and
there is a valid DSMIPv6 Binding Update list entry at the UE, the UE
shall send a Binding Update with the Lifetime field set to \"0\" in
order to remove the binding at the HA, as specified in
IETF RFC 6275 \[27\]. If an IPv4 home address was assigned to the UE, as
an optimization the UE may not include the IPv4 home address option as
the binding for the IPv4 home address will be removed by the HA.
Independent of an IPv6 or IPv4 access network the UE shall set the Key
Management Capability (K) bit in the de-registration Binding Update
message. The UE may preserve the IKEv2 session in order to avoid
re-establishing the session when the next handover occurs. If there is
not a safe assumption that the UE will remain in the home link (e.g.
switching off the non-3GPP radio interface in case of a dual radio
terminal), the UE should preserve the IKEv2 session.

If the UE receives a Binding Revocation Indication message from the HA
while there is an outstanding unacknowledged Binding Update with
Lifetime field set to \"0\" message, the UE need not send a Binding
Revocation Acknowledgement as specified in subclause 5.4.2.1.

### 5.2.3 HA procedures

#### 5.2.3.1 Handover from home link to a foreign link

In case of UE handover from home link to foreign link, the HA shall
support the initial registrstion procedure as specified in
subclause 5.1.3.

The error codes used in the Binding Acknowledgement are the same as
specified in subclause 5.1.3.2.

#### 5.2.3.2 Handover from a foreign link to another foreign link

When the HA receives a Binding Update from the UE, the HA shall validate
it as described in IETF RFC 6275 \[27\] and in IETF RFC 5555 \[2\]. If
the validation is successful, the HA shall update the binding cache
entry related to the Home Address included in the Binding Update.

If the Binding Update is an IPv6 packet, with the Alternate Care-of
Address option present, the HA shall verify the correctness of the
Alternate Care-of Address option. If the Care-of Address specified in
the Alternate Care-of Address option and in the Source Address field of
the IPv6 header of the Binding Update packet are different, the HA shall
reject the request by returning a Binding Acknowledgement with status
code 128. If the option is valid, the HA shall update the binding cache
entry with the Care-of Address in the Source Address of the IPv6 header.

If the Binding Update outer header is an IPv4 header and the IPv4
Care-of Address in the IPv4 Care-of Address option is the same as the
IPv4 address in the Source Address in the outer IPv4 header, the HA
shall update the binding cache entry with the Care-of Address in the
IPv4 Care-of Address option and shall send a Binding Acknowledgment
encapsulated in IPv4 as specified in IETF RFC 5555 \[2\].

If in the received Binding Update the IPv4 Care-of Address in the IPv4
Care-of Address option is not the same as the IPv4 address in the Source
Address in the outer IPv4 header then a NAT was in the path. This
information shall be included in the Binding Acknowledgement within a
NAT Detection option with the F bit set. The Binding Acknowledgment
shall be encapsulated in UDP and the binding cache updated as specified
in IETF RFC 5555 \[2\].

If the Binding Update contains an IPv4 Home Address option with an IPv4
Home Address previously assigned, the HA shall update also the binding
cache entry related to the IPv4 Home Address to the UE. If the Binding
Update contains no IPv4 Home Address option, the HA shall remove the
binding cache entry related to the IPv4 Home Address of the UE if
present.

If the Binding Update contains an IPv4 Home Address option with the
0.0.0.0 IPv4 address, the HA shall assign an IPv4 Home Address to the
UE, including an IPv4 Address Acknowledgement option in the Binding
Acknowledgement message.

The error codes used in the Binding Acknowledgement are the same as
specified in subclause 5.1.3.2.

If the Binding Update contains a BID mobility option and (optionally) a
Flow summary mobility option, the HA shall process the received Binding
Update message and send a Binding Acknowledgement message as described
in subclause 5.1.3.2.

If the Key Management Mobility Capability (K) bit is set in the Binding
Update and the HA supports the feature, the HA updates its IKEv2
security associations to include the UE\'s Care-of Address as the peer
address and the Binding Acknowledgement is returned with the K bit set.

The HA shall set the R bit to \"1\" in the Binding Acknowledgement.

#### 5.2.3.3 Handover from a foreign link to a home link

When a UE hands over from a foreign link to its home link, a network
based mobility protocol (PMIPv6 or GTP) in the home link creates a
binding cache entry for the UE. The DSMIPv6 binding cache entry that was
created by the UE on the foreign link shall not be overwritten. The
downlink UE packets shall be processed by the HA based on the DSMIPv6
binding cache entry before the DSMIPv6 binding cache entry is removed.

The DSMIPv6 binding cache entry shall be removed when a Binding Update
with lifetime field set to \"0\" is received by the HA from the UE. The
HA shall process the message as per IETF RFC 5555 \[2\] and
IETF RFC 6275 \[27\], removing the associated binding cache entry and
sending the Binding Acknowledge message with the Status field set to
\"0\" (Binding Update accepted). If an IPv4 home address was assigned to
the UE, the HA shall also remove the binding for the IPv4 home address
tied to the IPv6 home address included in the Binding Update.

If the HA decides to remove the DSMIPv6 binding cache entry of the UE,
prior to receiving a binding update with lifetime set to \"0\" from the
UE , the HA shall send a Binding Revocation Indication message as
specified in subclause 5.4.3.1.

NOTE: As described above, if the HA receives a Binding Update with
Lifetime field set to \"0\", the HA removes the associated binding cache
entry, but additionally the HA can store some data of the binding cache
entry for a certain time in order to allow the HA to identify a delayed
Binding Update registration message arriving at the HA after the Binding
Update de-registration.

5.3 Dual Stack Mobile IPv6 Re-Registration
------------------------------------------

### 5.3.1 General

The DSMIPv6 Re-Registration procedure can occur at any time when the UE
is already registered at the HA. The procedure is initiated by the UE
when it wishes to extend the lifetime of an existing registration, e.g.
in case the lifetime is expiring. The procedure can also be initiated by
the UE when it wishes to request an IPv4 home address or to release the
IPv4 binding while maintaining the IPv6 binding. The procedure may also
be initiated by the UE as a mechanism to refresh the NAT bindings in
order to be reachable from the HA.

NOTE: The usage of BU messages for keepalive purposes can have impacts
to the battery life of the UE. The UE can be configured to rate limiting
or avoid NAT keepalive as specified in IETF RFC 5555 \[2\].

### 5.3.2 UE procedures

As specified in IETF RFC 6275 \[27\], if the UE wants to extend the
validity of an existing binding at the HA, the UE shall send a new
Binding Update to the HA before the expiration of the lifetime indicated
in the received Binding Acknowledgement, even if it is not changing its
primary Care-of Address. This Binding Update is usually referred as
periodic Binding Update.

The UE shall follow the rules described in IETF RFC 6275 \[27\],
IETF RFC 5555 \[2\] and in subclause 5.1.2.4 to send a periodic Binding
Update and handle the associated Binding Acknowledgement. As the UE has
not performed any handover, the UE shall confirm the already registered
Care of Address and shall indicate the desired lifetime value. In a
periodic Binding Update the UE may request an IPv4 Home Address.

If a NAT was detected and the UE is not exchanging data traffic, the UE
may send a re-registration Binding Update in order to refresh the NAT
binding. The Binding Update shall be sent with the interval contained in
the Refresh Time field of the NAT detection option received when the NAT
was detected. If the Refresh Time field was set to all 1s, the UE shall
use the Binding Acknowledge lifetime as reference interval to send NAT
keepalives Binding Updates.

The UE may also send a re-registration Binding Update with the purpose
of requesting an IPv4 Home Address.

The UE may also send a re-registration Binding Update for the purpose of
releasing the IPv4 Home Address previoulsy assigned. For this purpose,
the UE shall follow the rules described in IETF RFC 5555 \[2\] sending a
re-registration Binding Update containing no IPv4 Home Address option.

If the UE is an IFOM capable UE configured for IFOM, the UE extends the
Binding Update with the following options:

a\) the UE shall set the O (Overwrite) flag to \"0\";

b\) the UE shall include a BID identifier mobility option in the Binding
Update as specified in IETF RFC 5648 \[31\];

\- the UE shall set the BID field to the value identifying the Binding
it wants to re-register;

\- the UE shall set the BID-PRI field to assign the priority to the BID
as indicated in IETF RFC 6089 \[32\]; and

c\) if the UE previously registered in the HA one or more routing
filters, the UE shall include a flow summary mobility option as
specified in IETF RFC 6089 \[32\] listing the values of the FIDs
identifying the registered routing filter.

### 5.3.3 HA procedures

When the HA receives a periodic Binding Update message from the UE, it
shall validate it as described in subclause 5.1.3.2, in
IETF RFC 6275 \[27\], IETF RFC 5555 \[2\] and IETF RFC 5648\[31\].

In processing a periodic Binding Update the HA shall follow the rules
described in subclause 5.1.3.2. In addition if the Binding Update does
not include the IPv4 home address option the HA shall remove any
associated IPv4 binding cache entry and continue to maintain the IPv6
binding.

If the HA accepts the Binding Update message, it shall update the
lifetime and sequence number of the existing entry in its binding cache
for the Home Address. If the Binding Update contains a BID mobility
option, the HA shall process it as specified in IETF RFC 5648 \[31\] and
IETF RFC 6089 \[32\]. If binding update is accepted, the HA shall insert
the BID mobility option into the Binding Acknowledgement message as
specified in IETF RFC 5648 \[31\]. The Care-of Address is not updated as
the periodic Binding Update is not used to update the Care-of Address.

5.4 Dual-Stack Mobile IPv6 detach
---------------------------------

### 5.4.1 General

The DSMIPv6 detach is performed by the UE to close the DSMIPv6 session
and the respective IKEv2 session or by the network to inform the UE that
it does not have access to a specific PDN through DSMIPv6 any longer.
After the DSMIPv6 detach procedure, the UE still has IP connectivity
provided by the access network.

There are two explicit detach procedures:

\- UE-initiated detach procedure: in this case the UE performs a DSMIPv6
de-registration with the HA and closes the IKEv2 session.

\- HA-initiated detach procedure: in this case the HA informs the UE
that the DSMIPv6 binding is no more valid. The UE shall then perform the
network-initiated detach procedure.

### 5.4.2 UE procedures

#### 5.4.2.1 Network-initiated detach

Upon receiving a Binding Revocation Indication (BRI) message according
to IETF RFC 5846 \[19\] from the HA, the UE first shall perform the
required validity checks on the BRI according to IETF RFC 5846 \[19\].

The UE shall send a Binding Revocation Acknowledgement (BRA) as
specified in IETF RFC 5846 \[19\]. In this message the UE shall set the
status field to \'Success\' to reflect that it has received the BRI
message. The BRA message may be tunnelled in UDP or IPv4 as specified in
subclause 5.1.2.4 for Binding Update messages.

The UE then shall remove the entry identified in the BRI as deregistered
from its binding update list and shall use the procedures defined in
IETF RFC 5996 \[14\] to remove the IPsec security associations
associated with the DSMIPv6 registration as described in
subclause 5.4.2.2.

#### 5.4.2.2 UE-initiated detach

To detach from a specific PDN to which it is connected through a DSMIPv6
session, the UE shall send a Binding Update with the Lifetime field set
to 0 as specified in IETF RFC 6275 \[27\].

The UE shall use the procedures defined in the IKEv2 protocol in
IETF RFC 5996 \[14\] to remove the IPsec security associations
associated with the DSMIPv6 registration. The UE shall close the
security associations associated with the DSMIPv6 registration and
instruct the HA to do the same by sending the INFORMATIONAL request
message including a DELETE payload. The Protocol ID in the DELETE
payload shall be set to \"1\" (IKE) to indicate that all IPsec ESP
security associations that were negotiated within the IKEv2 exchange
shall be deleted.

### 5.4.3 HA procedures

#### 5.4.3.1 Network-initiated detach

As soon as it receives a trigger for network-initiated detach procedure
(see 3GPP TS 29.273 \[20\]) the HA shall send a Binding Revocation
Indication (BRI) message according to IETF RFC 5846 \[19\] to the UE.
The message shall contain the Home Address, corresponding to the PDN
connection which shall be removed. The HA shall set the P (Proxy
Binding) bit to 0 (Not Proxy MIPv6 binding), G bit (Global) to 0 (only
the PDN Connection specified by the HoA is removed) and V bit (IPv4 HoA
Binding Only) to 0 (Not to terminate the IPv4 Home Address binding
only). The revocation trigger value shall be set to 1 (Unspecified). The
HA shall include the UE home address in the Type 2 routing header as per
IETF RFC 5846 \[19\] and shall not include any mobility option. The HA
shall not include a BID option in the BRI message. The BRI message may
be tunnelled in UDP or IPv4 as specified in subclause 5.1.3.2 for
Binding Acknowledgement messages.

The HA shall follow procedures according to IETF RFC 5846 \[19\] to
await the receipt of a Binding Revocation Acknowledgment (BRA) message
from the UE. These procedures are based on the timer MINDelayBRIs
defined in IETF RFC 5846 \[19\]. The HA shall not remove the entry from
its binding cache before receiving the BRA.

If the HA receives a Binding Update with Lifetime set to 0 after
initiating the network-initiated detach procedure, the HA should treat
the BU as acknowledgement to the BRI for the purposes of completing the
revocation procedures that are defined in IETF RFC 5846 \[19\]; in this
case, the HA shall remove the respective entry in its binding cache,
deleting the timer MINDelayBRIs and respond with a Binding
Acknowledgement according to IETF RFC 5555 \[2\] and
IETF RFC 6275 \[27\].

#### 5.4.3.2 UE-initiated detach

When the HA receives a Binding Update with the Lifetime field set to 0,
it shall delete any existing entry for the Home Address included in the
Binding Update. Then the HA shall send a Binding Acknowledgement as
specified in IETF RFC 5555 \[2\] and IETF RFC 6275 \[27\].

On receipt of the INFORMATIONAL request message including a DELETE
payload indicating that the UE is deleting the IPsec security
associations associated with the DSMIPv6 registration, the HA shall
close the IKE security association, and all IPsec ESP security
associations that were negotiated within it towards the UE.

5.5 Void
--------

5.5A Protection of data traffic
-------------------------------

### 5.5A.1 General

UE and HA can use the IKEv2 CREATE\_CHILD\_SA exchange procedure to
create a child security association to be used to provide integrity
protection, confidentiality protection or both, to all data traffic
exchanged within the DSMIPv6 tunnel. The procedure can be initiated by
the HA or by the UE at any time after the security association between
UE and HA has been set up. If both UE and HA independently decide to
initiate the child security association establishment, the procedure
described in IETF RFC 5996 \[14\] applies. The profiles for tunnel mode
IPsec ESP are defined in 3GPP TS 33.402 \[18\].

### 5.5A.2 UE procedures

After establishing the IPsec security association with the HA as
described in subclause 5.1.2.2, the UE may initiate the creation of
child security association pair to provide integrity protection,
confidentiality protection or both. If the UE determines that the trust
relationship of the non-3GPP access network is \"untrusted\" (see
3GPP TS 24.302 \[21\]), the UE shall not initiate the creation of child
security association. If the UE initiates the creation of child security
association pair, the UE shall send to the HA a CREATE\_CHILD\_SA
request as described in IETF RFC 4877 \[4\] and IETF RFC 5996 \[14\]
with the following additions:

a\) the content of the Security Association payload is set accordingly
for integrity protection, confidentiality protection or both as
indicated in IETF RFC 5996 \[14\] using the IPsec profiles defined in
3GPP TS 33.402 \[18\]; and

b\) the TSi shall contain all the Home Network Prefix assigned to the
UE. If prefix delegation is used, the TSi shall also contain all the
prefix(es) provided to the UE. If the UE received an IPv4 Home Address,
the TSi shall also contain the IPv4 Home Address.

When the UE receives a CREATE\_CHILD\_SA request from the HA with
selectors indicating the DSMIPv6 tunnel traffic, if the UE supports
integrity protection, confidentiality protection or both, the UE shall
reply with a CREATE\_CHILD\_SA response selecting the preferred
transform proposed by the HA as specified in IETF RFC 5996 \[14\].

If the child SA is created successfully, the UE shall start
encapsulating all the uplink packets in the DSMIPv6 tunnel in an IPsec
ESP tunnel as negotiated with the HA during the CREATE\_CHILD\_SA
procedure.

The UE can stop using integrity protection, confidentiality protection
or both, for the DSMIPv6 tunnel traffic. In order to do that, the UE
shall delete the respective child security association by sending an
INFORMATIONAL request message including the DELETE payload as specified
in IETF RFC 5996 \[14\].

### 5.5A.3 HA procedures

After establishing the IPsec security association with the UE as
described in subclause 5.1.3.1, the HA may initiate the creation of
child security association pair to provide integrity protection,
confidentiality protection or both. If the HA receives the trust
relationship indication as \"untrusted\" from the 3GPP AAA server during
the authentication and authorization procedure or the authorization
procedure (see 3GPP TS 29.273 \[20\]), the HA shall not initiate the
creation of child security association procedure. If the trust
relationship indication is not received, the initiation of the creation
of the child security association is implementation dependent (e.g.
based on configuration). If the HA initiates the creation of child
security association pair, the HA shall send to the UE a
CREATE\_CHILD\_SA request as described in IETF RFC 4877 \[4\] and
IETF RFC 5996 \[14\] with the following additions:

a\) the content of the Security Association payload is set accordingly
for integrity protection, confidentiality protection or both as
indicated in IETF RFC 5996 \[14\] using the IPsec profiles defined in
3GPP TS 33.402 \[18\]; and

b\) the TSi shall contain all the Home Network Prefix assigned to the
UE. If prefix delegation is used, the TSi shall also contain all the
prefix(es) provided to the UE. If the UE received an IPv4 Home Address,
the TSi shall also contain the IPv4 Home Address.

When the HA receives a CREATE\_CHILD\_SA request from the UE with
selectors indicating the DSMIPv6 tunnel traffic, if the HA supports
integrity protection, confidentiality protection or both, the HA shall
check whether the child security association establishment can be
accepted or not. If the HA receives the trust relationship indication
set to \"untrusted\" indication from the 3GPP AAA server (see
3GPP TS 29.273 \[20\]), the HA shall reject the child security
association establishment by using the NOTIFY payload of type
\"NO\_ADDITIONAL\_SAS\" in the CREATE\_CHILD\_SA response. If HA does
not receive the trust relationship indication, whether to accept or
reject the child security association is implementation dependent.
Otherwise, the HA shall reply with a CREATE\_CHILD\_SA response
selecting the preferred transform proposed by the HA as specified in
IETF RFC 5996 \[14\].

If the child SA is created successfully, the HA shall start
encapsulating, all the uplink packets in the DSMIPv6 tunnel in an IPsec
ESP tunnel as negotiated with the UE during the CREATE\_CHILD\_SA
procedure.

The HA can stop using integrity protection, confidentiality protection
or both, for the DSMIPv6 tunnel traffic. In order to do that, the HA
shall delete the respective child security association by sending an
INFORMATIONAL request message including the DELETE payload as specified
in IETF RFC 5996 \[14\].

5.6 Attach to additional access network
---------------------------------------

### 5.6.1 General

The operations defined within subclause 5.6 apply to an IFOM capable UE
configured for IFOMand a HA supporting IFOM.

The attach to additional access network procedure is performed by a UE
supporting IFOM that has already established a PDN connection through an
access network and decides to extend the PDN connection to another
access network.

There can be two possible scenarios:

\- the existing access network is a home link and the added access
network is a foreign link; or

\- the existing access network is a foreign link and the added access
network is a home link.

The attach to additional access network procedure involves performing
the following:

\- access specific procedure to connect and configure an IP address for
the added access network;

\- discovery of a HA IP address if the UE has not obtained the IP
address of the HA;

\- home link detection;

\- setting up a security association if there is no security existing
association between the UE and HA; and

\- exchange of Binding Update and Binding Acknowledgement with the BID
mobility option and FID mobility option between the UE and HA.

### 5.6.2 UE procedures

#### 5.6.2.1 General

For the attach to additional access network procedure, the UE is already
attached to either a home link or foreign link and discovers a new link.
The UE applies the DSMIPv6 Home Link Detection Function as specified in
subclause 5.1.2.3 to determine if the new link will be a home link or a
foreign link. If the new link is a home link, the UE follows the
procedure as specified in subclause 5.6.2.2. If the new link is a
foreign link, the UE follows the procedure as specified in
subclause 5.6.2.3.

#### 5.6.2.2 Attach to additional access network acting as home link

The UE shall perform the DSMIPv6 Home Link Detection Function as
specified in subclause 5.1.2.3.

In addition, the UE shall perform the initial binding registration and
IPv4 Home Address assignment as specified in subclause 5.1.2.4 with the
following additional rules:

a\) the UE shall send a Binding Update through the home link;

b\) the O (Overwrite) flag in the Binding Update shall be set to \"0\";

c\) the UE shall insert a BID mobility option in this Binding Update
with:

\- the \'H\' flag in the BID mobility option set to \"1\";

\- the Care-of Address field set to the IPv6 Home Address of the
binding; and

\- the BID-PRI field set to assign the priority to the BID as indicated
in IETF RFC 6089 \[32\];

d\) if routing filters were previously registered with the HA, the UE
shall include a flow summary mobility option as specified in
IETF RFC 6089 \[32\] listing the values of the FIDs identifying the
routing filter that were previously registered; and

e\) if the UE creates one or more routing rules as specified in
subclause 5.1.2.4, for each FID mobility option, the value of the BID
field in the Binding Reference suboption identifies the routing address
that the UE wants to use to exchange packets matching the routing
filter.

When the UE receives the Binding Acknowledgment from the HA, the UE
shall process the Binding Acknowledgment as specified in
subclause 5.1.2.4.

#### 5.6.2.3 Attach to an additional access acting as foreign link

The UE shall perform the same procedures described in subclause 5.1.2.4.
The UE shall send the Binding Update message through the added link. In
addition, the UE shall register the binding for the home link by
including a BID mobility option in the Binding Update message. The BID
mobility option fields for the binding for the home link are those
indicated in IETF RFC 5648 \[31\] for home binding with the following
distinctions:

\(a\) the H flag shall be set to \"1\";

\(b\) the Care-of Address field shall be set to the IPv6 HoA of the
binding; and

\(c\) the BID-PRI field shall be set to the assigned priority of the BID
as indicated in IETF RFC 6089 \[32\].

The UE shall process the received Binding Acknowledgement as specified
in subclause 5.1.2.4.

### 5.6.3 HA procedures

#### 5.6.3.1 General

The following subclauses describe the detailed HA procedures for the
case when a UE is attaching to an additional access network.

#### 5.6.3.2 Attach to an additional access network acting as home link

When receiving a Binding Update from the UE, the HA performs the same
procedure as specified in subclause 5.2.3.2. In addition, the HA shall
validate the Binding Update as described in IETF RFC 5648 \[31\],
IETF RFC 6089 \[32\] and IETF RFC 6088 \[33\].

#### 5.6.3.3 Attach to additional access acting as foreign link

When receiving a Binding Update from the UE, the HA performs the same
procedures described in subclause 5.2.3.2 and in addition the HA shall
validate the Binding Update as described in IETF RFC 5648 \[31\], and
IETF RFC 6089 \[32\] and IETF RFC 6088 \[33\]. As described in
IETF RFC 5648 \[31\], the HA shall:

\- process the IPv6 address contained in the BID option with the H flag
set to 0 as the Care-of Address; and

\- process the IPv4 address contained in the BID option with the H flag
set to 0 in the same way as the HA process the address contained in the
IPv4 Care-of Address option in subclause 5.2.3.2.

5.7 Inter-access flow mobility
------------------------------

### 5.7.1 General

The operations defined within this sub-clause apply to an IFOM capable
UE configured for IFOM and to HA supporting IFOM.

The inter-access flow mobility is performed by the UE supporting IFOM
that already established a PDN connection and exchanges packets
belonging to the PDN connection through multiple access networks. The UE
has previously registered one or more routing rules with the HA.

In this procedure, the UE updates the HA by performing any of the
following operations:

\- assigning one or more routing filters to an access network different
from the one those routing filters were previously assigned;

\- adding one or more new routing rules to the HA; or

\- removing one or more previously registered routing rules from the HA.

The procedure involves the exchange of a Binding Update and a Binding
Acknowledgement with BID and FID options between the UE and the HA.

### 5.7.2 UE procedures

The UE performs the same procedures described in subclause 5.3.2 with
the following exceptions:

\- the UE shall set the O (Overwrite) flag to 0;

\- the UE shall not include any Alternate Care-of Address option in the
Binding Update message; and

\- the UE shall not include any IPv4 Care-of Address option in the
Binding Update message.

In addition, the UE shall extend the Binding Update message with the
following options (see IETF RFC 5648 \[31\], IETF RFC 6089 \[32\] and
IETF RFC 6088 \[33\]):

a\) The UE shall include a BID identifier mobility option:

\- the BID field is set to the value identifying the routing address
used as IP Source Address of the Binding Update message;

> \- if the Binding Update message is sent over a home link, the \"H\"
> flag is set to 1;
>
> \- if the Binding Update message is sent over a foreign link, the
> \"H\" flag is set to 0;

\- the BID-PRI priority field is set to the priority assigned to the BID
as indicated in IETF RFC 6089 \[32\]; and

\- if the routing address is an IPv4 address, a NAT was detected and the
UE is not exchanging data traffic, the UE may insert the routing address
in the Care-of Address field of the BID mobility option;

b\) the UE may create one or more routing rules. For each routing rule
that the UE wants to register with the HA, the UE shall include a FID
mobility option containing one traffic selector as specified in
IETF RFC 6089 \[32\]. Traffic selectors are defined in
IETF RFC 6088 \[33\]:

\- the UE shall set the FID field to an arbitrary value;

\- the UE shall set the FID-PRI field to assign the priority to the
routing filter as indicated in IETF RFC 6089 \[32\];

\- the UE shall include a Binding Reference suboption as indicated in
IETF RFC 6089 \[32\]. The value assigned to the BID identifies the
routing address that the UE wants to use to exchange the packets
matching the routing filters; and

\- traffic selector suboption shall be set as specified in
IETF RFC 6089 \[32\] and IETF RFC 6088 \[33\]. The parameters described
in the traffic selector suboption represent the routing filter that
corresponds to the routing rule that the UE wants to register with the
HA;

c\) The UE may insert a flow summary mobility option (as described in
IETF RFC 6089 \[32\]).

\- If the UE wants to keep some routing rules previously registered
unmodified, i.e. no flow handover, the UE lists the values of the FIDs
identifying the routing rules that the UE wants to keep unmodified in
the flow summary mobility option; and

\- If the UE wants to remove one or more previously registered routing
rules, the UE does not include in the flow summary mobility option the
FIDs identifying the routing rules that the UE wants to remove; and

d\) the UE may modify one or more routing rules with the HA. For each
routing rule that the UE wants to modify, the UE shall include a FID
mobility option as specified in IETF RFC 6089 \[32\].

\- the UE shall set the FID field to the value identifying the routing
filter the UE wants to handover;

\- the UE shall set the FID-PRI field to assign the priority to the BID
as indicated in IETF RFC 6089 \[32\]; and

\- the UE shall include a Binding Reference suboption as indicated in
IETF RFC 6089 \[32\]. The value assigned to the BID identifies the
routing address that the UE wants to use to exchange the packets
matching the routing filters.

The handling of the received Binding Acknowledgement message is the same
as specified in subclause 5.1.2.4. In addition, the UE handles the FID
and BID mobility options contained in the received Binding
Acknowledgment message as specified in IETF RFC 5648 \[31\],
IETF RFC 6089 \[32\] and IETF RFC 6088 \[33\].

### 5.7.3 HA procedures

When receiving a Binding Update from the UE, the HA performs the same
procedures described in subclause 5.3.3 and in addition the HA shall
validate the Binding Update as described in IETF RFC 5648 \[31\],
IETF RFC 6089 \[32\] and IETF RFC 6088 \[33\].

5.8 UE-initiated removal of an access network from a PDN connection
-------------------------------------------------------------------

### 5.8.1 General

The operations defined within this sub-clause apply to an IFOM capable
UE configured for IFOM and to HA supporting IFOM.

The removal of an access network from a PDN connection procedure is
initiated by a UE which has a PDN connection through multiple access
networks. In this procedure, the UE stops using one of the access
network for the PDN connection.

The procedure involves the exchange of a Binding Update and a Binding
Acknowledgement between the UE and the HA.

There can be two possible scenarios:

\- home link access network is removed and foreign link access network
is maintained; or

\- foreign link access network is removed and home link access network
is maintained.

### 5.8.2 UE procedures

#### 5.8.2.1 General

The removal of an access network from a PDN connection is performed by a
UE attached to multiple access networks. The UE sends a Binding Update
message in order to update the HA binding cache removing the entry
corresponding to the removed access network. If the removed access
network is a home link, the UE follows the procedure as specified in
subclause 5.8.2.2. If the removed access network is a foreign link, the
UE follows the procedure as specified in subclause 5.8.2.3.

#### 5.8.2.2 Removal of Home link access

If the UE removes the home link from a specific PDN connection, the UE
shall perform one of the following operations:

\(a\) the UE sends a Binding Update with the Lifetime field set to 0 as
specified in IETF RFC 5555 \[2\] and IETF RFC 6275 \[27\] and with a BID
mobility option. The UE populates the BID mobility option as follows
(see IETF RFC 5648 \[31\]):

\- the BID identifier field is set to the BID corresponding to the
access network the UE wants to remove;

\- the H flag is set to 0; and

\- the Care-of Address field in the BID mobility option is omitted;

or:

\(b\) the UE sends a Binding Update message as indicated in
subclause 5.1.2.4 with the following additions:

\- the Binding Update message shall be exchanged through the maintained
access network;

\- the BID identifier field is set to the value identifying the
maintained access network; and

\- the Care-of Address field in the BID mobility option is omitted.

NOTE: The choice of the operation to follow is up to UE implementation.

#### 5.8.2.3 Removal of foreign link from a PDN connection

If the UE removes an access network acting as foreign link from a
specific PDN connection and maintains the connection to the PDN through
the home link, the UE shall send a Binding Update message with the
Lifetime field set to 0 as specified in subclause 5.4.2.2.If the UE
decides to close the security association set up with the HA, the UE
shall send the INFORMATIONAL request message including a DELETE payload
as specified in subclause 5.4.2.2.

### 5.8.3 HA procedures

#### 5.8.3.1 General

The following subclauses describe the detailed HA procedures for the
case when a UE is removing an access network from a PDN connection.

#### 5.8.3.2 Removal of home link access from a PDN connection

In case of removal of a home link from a PDN connection executed by the
UE, the HA shall perform the following operations:

\- if the Lifetime field of the received Binding Update is set to 0, the
HA processes the received Binding Update message as described in
IETF RFC 5555 \[2\] and IETF RFC 6275 \[27\] and IETF RFC 5648 \[31\];
and

\- if the Lifetime field of the received Binding Update is not set to 0,
the HA shall perform the same procedures described in subclause 5.6.3.3.

#### 5.8.3.3 Removal of foreign link from a PDN connection

When the HA receives a Binding Update with the Lifetime field set to 0,
the HA shall perform the same procedures described in subclause 5.4.3.2.

5.9 Network-initiated removal of an access network from a PDN connection
------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 5.9.1 General

The operations defined within this subclause apply to IFOM capable UE
configured for IFOM and to HA supporting IFOM.

The removal of an access network from a PDN connection procedure is
initiated by the HA for a UE that has an established PDN connection
through multiple access networks with the HA. In this procedure, the HA
informs the UE that an entry in the binding cache is no more valid over
one of the access network for the PDN connection. The UE then performs
the network-initiated removal of an access network from a PDN connection
procedure.

The procedure involves the exchange of a Binding Revocation Indication
(BRI) message and a Binding Revocation Acknowledgement (BRA) between the
UE and the HA as specified in IETF RFC 5846 \[19\].

Once the procedure is completed, the UE uses the maintained access
network for the PDN connection.

There can be two possible scenarios:

\- home link access network is removed and foreign link access network
is maintained; or

\- foreign link access network is removed and home link access network
is maintained.

### 5.9.2 UE procedures

#### 5.9.2.1 General

The following subclauses describe the detailed UE procedures for the
case when the HA removes an access network from a PDN connection.

#### 5.9.2.2 Removal of home link access from a PDN connection

Upon receiving a BRI message with a BID option, the UE shall perform the
procedure as specified in subclause 5.4.2.1 with the following
additions:

\- the UE shall process the BID mobility option as specified in
IETF RFC 5846 \[19\];

\- the UE shall include the received BID mobility option in the BRA as
specified in IETF RFC 5846 \[19\]; and

\- the UE shall not close the security associations set up with the HA.

#### 5.9.2.3 Removal of foreign link from a PDN connection

Upon receiving a BRI message without a BID mobility option from the HA,
the UE shall process the BRI message as specified in subclause 5.4.2.1.
If the UE decides to close the security association set up with the HA,
the UE shall send the INFORMATIONAL request message including a DELETE
payload as specified in subclause 5.4.2.2.

### 5.9.3 HA procedures

#### 5.9.3.1 General

The following subclauses describe the detailed HA procedures for the
case when the HA removes an access network from a PDN connection.

#### 5.9.3.2 Removal of home link access from a PDN connection

In order to remove the home link access from a PDN connection, the HA
shall perform the procedure as specified in subclause 5.4.3.1 with the
following additions:

\- the HA shall include a BID mobility option of the home link access in
the BRI message sent to the UE; and

\- the HA shall only remove the home binding of the the PDN connection
from the HA binding update cache, when a BRA message with the same BID
mobility option is received.

#### 5.9.3.3 Removal of foreign link from a PDN connection

In order to remove the foreign link access network from a PDN
connection, the HA shall perform the network initiated detach procedure
by sending a BRI message without a BID mobility option as described in
subclause 5.4.3.1.

If an INFORMATIONAL request message including a DELETE payload is
received, the HA shall perform the procedure as specified in
subclause 5.4.3.2.
