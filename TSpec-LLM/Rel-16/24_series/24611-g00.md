4 Anonymous Communication Rejection (ACR) and Communication Barring (CB)
========================================================================

4.1 Introduction
----------------

The **Communication Barring (CB)** service offers the following
services:

\- The Incoming Communication Barring (ICB) is a service that rejects
incoming communications that fulfil certain provisioned or configured
conditions on behalf of the terminating user.

\- The Anonymous Communication Rejection **(ACR)** is a particular case
of the ICB service, that allows barring of incoming communications from
an anonymous originator on behalf of the terminating user.

\- The **Outgoing Communication Barring (OCB)** is a service that
rejects outgoing communications that fulfil certain provisioned or
configured conditions on behalf of the originating user.

4.2 Description
---------------

### 4.2.1 General description

The Incoming Communication Barring (ICB**)** service makes it possible
for a user to have barring of certain categories of incoming
communications according to a provisioned or user configured barring
program and is valid for all incoming communications. A barring program
is expressed as a set of rules in which the rules have a conditional
part and an action part. Examples of conditions are whether the asserted
originating public user identity matches a specific public user identity
or whether the originating public user identity is restricted
(anonymous). The action part could specify for a rule that contains a
matching condition that the specific incoming communication is barred.
The complete set of conditions and actions that apply to this service
and their semantics is described in subclause 4.9.

The Inhibition of Incoming Forwarded Calls is a special case of the ICB
and allows the served user to reject incoming communications from users
or subscribers who have diverted the communication towards the served
user. The communication history information will be used to trigger the
service as described in subclause 4.9.

The Anonymous Communication Rejection (ACR) service allows the served
user to reject incoming communications on which the asserted public user
identity of the originating user is restricted. In case the asserted
public user identity of the originating user is not provided then the
communication is allowed by the ACR service.

An example where the originating user restricts presentation of the
asserted public user identity is when he activated the OIR service
3GPP TS 24.607 \[3\].

The originating user is given an appropriate indication that the
communication has been rejected due to the application of the ACR
service.

The Anonymous Communication Rejection (ACR) service is a special case of
the ICB service, which is highlighted here because it is a regulatory
service in many countries. The ACR service can be activated for a
specific subscriber by configuring an ICB service barring rule where the
conditional part contains the \"Condition=anonymous\" and the action
part \"allow=false\".

The Outgoing Communication Barring (OCB) service makes it possible for a
user to have barring of certain categories of outgoing communications
according to a provisioned or user configured barring program and is
valid for all outgoing communications. A barring program is expressed as
a set of rules in which the rules have a conditional part and an action
part. An example condition is whether the request uri matches a specific
public user identity. The action part can specify for a rule that
contains a matching condition that the specific outgoing communication
it to be barred. The complete set of conditions and actions that apply
to this service and their semantics is described in subclause 4.9.

The configuration over the Ut interface of a barring service can be
protected by a password. If the subscriber at provisioning time selects
the value \"by subscriber using a password\" for the subscription option
\"control of barring services\", the password is provisioned by the
operator at that time. At any later time it is possible to change the
password using mechanisms specified in 3GPP TS 24.623 \[6\].

4.3 Operational requirements
----------------------------

### 4.3.1 Provision/withdrawal

The ACR/CB service shall be provided after prior arrangement with the
service provider.

The ACR/CB service shall be withdrawn at the served user\'s request or
for administrative reasons.

The communication barring services can be offered with a subscription
option \"control of barring services\". If offered, the subscriber
selects one value for the \"control of barring services\". This
subscription option is part of the communication barring profile for the
served user. The subscription option is shown in table 4.3.1-1.

Table 4.3.1-1: Subscription option for barring services

+-----------------------------+---------------------------------------+
| Subscription option         | Value                                 |
+-----------------------------+---------------------------------------+
| control of barring services | by subscriber using a password\       |
|                             | \_\_\_\_\_\                           |
|                             | _\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ |
|                             |                                       |
|                             | by the service provider               |
+-----------------------------+---------------------------------------+

If the subscriber at provisioning time for the subscription option
\"control of barring services\" selected the value \"by subscriber using
a password\", the service provider provisions an initial password for
all communication barring services. Subsequently, the user can change
the communication barring password at any time. The procedure to
register a new communication barring password over the Ut interface is
specified in 3GPP TS 24.623 \[6\]. The procedure to register a new
communication barring password using the SIP based user configuration is
specified in 3GPP TS 24.238 \[20\].

If the subscriber at provision time has selected the value \"by the
service provider\", then an attempt to register a new communication
barring password will be rejected as specified in 3GPP TS 24.623 \[6\]
for Ut interface and 3GPP TS 24.238 \[20\] for SIP based user
configuration.

If the service provider does not offer the subscription option \"control
of barring services\", the subscriber can manipulate the barring
settings without using a password.

The subscription option \"control of barring services\" described in
this specification corresponds to the \"control of supplementary
service\" option defined in 3GPP TS 24.623 \[6\] for Ut interface and in
3GPP TS 24.238 \[20\] for SIP based user configuration.

### 4.3.2 Requirements on the originating network side

No specific requirements are needed in the network.

NOTE: Annex B includes an example of an IFC that can be used to invoke
the OCB service.

### 4.3.3 Requirements in the network

No specific requirements are needed in the network.

### 4.3.4 Requirements on the terminating network side

No specific requirements are needed in the network.

NOTE: Annex B includes an example of an IFC that can be used to invoke
the ACR/ICB service.

4.4 Coding requirements
-----------------------

### 4.4.1 ICB coding requirements

No specific requirements have been identified.

To indicate the dynamic ICB the terminating UE shall send either:

\- a 603 (Decline) response including a Reason header field containing
603 Decline; or

\- a BYE request including a Reason header field containing 603 Decline;
or

\- an initial INVITE request including a SSC command.

### 4.4.2 ACR coding requirements

The Privacy header field and the P-Asserted-Identity header fields as
defined within 3GPP TS 24.229 \[2\], are used to trigger the service.
The response code 433 (Anonymity Disallowed) defined by
IETF RFC 5079 \[18\] is used in support of ACR service.

### 4.4.3 OCB coding requirements

No specific requirements have been identified.

4.5 Signalling requirements
---------------------------

### 4.5.0 General

Configuration of supplementary services by the user should:

\- take place over the Ut interface using XCAP as enabling protocol as
described in 3GPP TS 24.623 \[6\]; or

\- use SIP based user configuration as described in
3GPP TS 24.238 \[20\].

NOTE: Other possibilities for user configuration, such as web-based
provisioning or pre-provisioning by the operator are outside the scope
of the present document, but are not precluded

If the subscription option \"control of barring services\" is set to
\"by subscriber using a password\", the subscriber needs to provide a
password when manipulating the barring supplementary service.

If the subscription option \"control of barring services\" is set to
\"by the service provider\", the barring supplementary service cannot be
manipulated by the subscriber. The manipulation of the barring
supplementary service has to be performed by the service provider. An
attempt to manipulate the barring supplementary service over Ut
interface will be rejected as specified in 3GPP TS 24.623 \[6\]. An
attempt to manipulate the barring supplementary service using SIP based
user configuration will be rejected as specified in
3GPP TS 24.238 \[20\].

For password handling, when the UE is using the Ut interface for service
configuration, the UE shall follow the procedures specified in
3GPP TS 24.623 \[6\]. The UE can learn that a password is required by
finding a \"password-required\" attribute set to \"true\" in both the
\<incoming-communication-barring\> and the
\<outgoing-communication-barring\> elements.

For password handling, when the UE is using the SIP based user
configuration, the UE shall follow the procedures specified in
3GPP TS 24.238 \[20\].

The enhancements to the XML schema for use over the Ut interface are
described in subclause 4.9.

### 4.5.1 Activation/deactivation

The services ICB, OCB and ACR are individually activated at provisioning
or at the subscribers request by using the mechanisms specified in
subclause 4.5.0.

The services ICB, OCB and ACR are individually deactivated at withdrawal
or at the subscribers request by using the mechanisms specified in
subclause 4.5.0.

#### 4.5.1A Registration/erasure

For registration of information for the services ICB, OCB and ACR, the
mechanisms specified in subclause 4.5.0 should be used. The detailed
information for the services ICB, OCB and ACR can individually be
registered at the subscribers request by using the mechanisms specified
in subclause 4.5.0.

For erasure of information for the services ICB, OCB and ACR, the
mechanisms specified in subclause 4.5.0 should be used. The detailed
information for the services ICB, OCB and ACR can individually be erased
at the subscribers request by using the mechanisms specified in
subclause 4.5.0.

#### 4.5.1B Interrogation

For interrogation of the services ICB, OCB and ACR, the mechanisms
specified in subclause 4.5.0 should be used.

For interrogation of the supported conditions and actions that can be
used in the network the Ut interface should be used.

### 4.5.2 Invocation and operation

#### 4.5.2.1 Actions at the originating UE

Procedures according to 3GPP TS 24.229 \[2\] shall apply.

#### 4.5.2.2 Void

#### 4.5.2.3 Void

#### 4.5.2.4 Actions at the originating AS

##### 4.5.2.4.1 Actions for OCB at the originating AS

The AS providing the OCB service shall operate as either an AS acting as
a SIP proxy as specified in subclause 5.7.4 of 3GPP TS 24.229 \[2\] or
an AS providing 3rd party call control, and specifically as a routeing
B2BUA, as specified in subclause 5.7.5 of 3GPP TS 24.229 \[2\]. An AS
providing the OCB service and rejecting the request shall operate as a
terminating UA, as specified in subclause 5.7.2 of 3GPP TS 24.229 \[2\].

NOTE: For the case when the session is not subject to OCB according the
requirements in this document, and is the only service being applied by
the AS, then the AS only needs to act as a SIP proxy. If additional
services are applied, then the AS might need to act as a routeing B2BUA.

The AS providing the OCB service shall reject outgoing communications
when the evaluation of the served users outgoing communication barring
rules according to the algorithm as specified in subclause 4.9.1.2
evaluates to (allow=\"false\"),.Outgoing communications towards
emergency services are always allowed irrespective of what barring
settings the user has defined. To allow emergency calls to go through,
the operator creates a white list, as described in subclause 4.9.1.3,
including emergency numbers in any useful format including emergency
service URNs specified in RFC 5031\[23\]. For the purpose of OCB, the AS
shall evaluate the \"cp:identity\" and \"ocp:external-list\" conditions
against the called party identity taken from Request-URI or additionally
taken from the To header field.

When the AS providing the OCB service rejects a communication, the AS
shall send an indication to the calling user by sending a 603 (Decline)
response Additionally, before terminating the communication the AS can
provide an announcement to the originating user. The procedure of
invoking an announcement is described within 3GPP TS 24.628 \[10\].

#### 4.5.2.5 Void

#### 4.5.2.6 Actions at the terminating AS

##### 4.5.2.6.1 Actions for ICB at the terminating AS

The AS providing the ICB service shall operate as either an AS acting as
a SIP proxy as specified in subclause 5.7.4 of 3GPP TS 24.229 \[2\] or
an AS providing 3rd party call control, and specifically as a routeing
B2BUA, as specified in subclause 5.7.5 of 3GPP TS 24.229 \[2\]. An AS
providing the ICB service and rejecting the request shall operate as a
terminating UA, as specified in subclause 5.7.2 of 3GPP TS 24.229 \[2\].

NOTE 1: For the case when the session is not subject to ICB according
the requirements in this document, and is the only service being applied
by the AS, then the AS only needs to act as a SIP proxy. If additional
services are applied, then the AS might need to act as a routeing B2BUA.

The AS shall based on local policy on how to handle PSAP callbacks
suppress ICB when the received initial INVITE request towards the served
user is identified as a PSAP callback.

The mechanism to identify an INVITE request as a PSAP callback depends
on local policy and can be based on the PSAP callback indicator
specified in IETF RFC 7090 \[21\].

The AS providing the ICB service shall reject initial incoming requests
when the evaluation of the served users incoming communication barring
rules according to the algorithm as specified in subclause 4.9.1.2
evaluates to (allow=\"false\"). For the purpose of ICB, the AS shall
evaluate the \"cp:identity\" and \"ocp:external-list\" conditions
against the calling party identity taken from the P-Asserted-Identity
header field or additionally taken from the From header field or the
Referred-By header field.

NOTE 2: The procedures give the flexibility for OPTIONS requests to be
treated differently to the equivalent INVITE requests. Unless this
capability is specifically required, care is needed in the design of the
rules to treat these identically. Rejecting an incoming OPTIONS request
can cause the originator not to attempt to place a call to the intended
recipient of the OPTIONS.

The dynamic ICB is a network option to extend the ICB functionality:

To bar an incoming request, the AS providing the dynamic ICB service
receives from the terminating UE:

\- a 603 (Decline) response including a Reason header field containing
603 Declinefor a dialog initiating request

\- a BYE request including a Reason header field containing 603 Decline
or

\- an initial INVITE request including a SSC command.

The AS providing the dynamic ICB service shall store the following
information:

**-** Actual identity of caller: Network asserted identity of the
calling user which is stored in the network and additionally the
identity included within the From header (defined in
IETF RFC 3261 \[22\]). If the received identity is a restricted identity
(a Privacy header field with the values \"user\", \"header\" or \"id\")
then the actual identity of the caller shall never be presented or be
accessable (e.g. via the blacklist maintenance) to the served user.

NOTE 3: If the barred caller has requested privacy (e.g. by subscribing
to ORI service) the served user may just see \"Anonymous\" or
\"Unknown\". However the served user can invoke dynamic ICB since the
network knows the true identity of the caller. To facilitate the
management of the list of barred callers, the served user may use the
reason field to identify the barred caller.

\- Start and end date for barring: Define the duration of barring. If
not provided, it implies that the caller should be barred permanently or
for a maximum lifetime which is set by the network operator preferences.

Depending on operator policy, the following information may be
additionally provided by the user at the time of barring and shall be
associated by the AS with the actual identity:

\- Reason: The reason for barring (e.g. \"Telemarketer\"), and

\- Published identity of caller: This consists of the actual identity of
the caller; \"a valid SIP URI\", or \"private user identity\", or
\"anonymous\" if the caller has opted for privacy. This identity is
conveyed by P-Asserted Identity or as an option by the From header
(defined in IETF RFC 3261 \[22\]).

The ACR service is a special case of the ICB service and is expressed as
the following rule:

\- Condition: =anonymous, Action: allow=false.

For any rule set that evaluates to (allow=\"false\") and where one of
the matching rules contained the anonymous condition, the AS shall
execute the procedures as specified in subclause 4.5.2.6.2.

When the AS providing the ICB service rejects a communication, the AS
shall send an indication to the calling user by sending a 603 (Decline)
response Additionally, if the barred communication is a voice or video
call, before terminating the communication the AS can provide an
announcement to the originating user. The procedure of invoking an
announcement is described within 3GPP TS 24.628 \[10\].

##### 4.5.2.6.2 Action for ACR at the terminating AS

The AS providing the ACR service shall operate as either an AS acting as
a SIP proxy as specified in subclause 5.7.4 of 3GPP TS 24.229 \[2\] or
an AS providing 3rd party call control, and specifically as a routeing
B2BUA, as specified in subclause 5.7.5 of 3GPP TS 24.229 \[2\]. An AS
providing the ACR service and rejecting the request shall operate as a
terminating UA, as specified in subclause 5.7.2 of 3GPP TS 24.229 \[2\].

NOTE: For the case when the session or transaction is not subject to ACR
according the requirements in this document, and is the only service
being applied by the AS, then the AS only needs to act as a SIP proxy.
If additional services are applied, then the AS might need to act as a
routeing B2BUA.

The AS providing the ACR service shall reject all incoming
communications where the incoming SIP request:

1)  includes the P-Asserted-Identity header field AND includes the
    Privacy header field indicating \"id\" as specified in
    IETF RFC 3325 \[13\]; or

2)  includes the P-Asserted-Identity header field AND includes the
    Privacy header field indicating \"header\" as specified in
    IETF RFC 3323 \[14\]; or

3)  includes the P-Asserted-Identity header field AND includes the
    Privacy header field indicating \"user\" as specified in
    IETF RFC 3323 \[14\].

NOTE: In all other cases the communication proceeds normally.

When the AS providing the ACR service rejects a communication, the AS
shall send an indication to the calling user by sending a 433 (Anonymity
Disallowed) response. Additionally, if the barred communication is a
voice or video call, before terminating the communication the AS can
provide an announcement to the originating user. The procedure of
invoking an announcement is described within 3GPP TS 24.628 \[10\].

If the barred communication is a voice or video call, as a service
option the AS providing the ACR service can forward the communication to
a voice message service instead of rejecting the communication with a
433 (Anonymity Disallowed) final response.

#### 4.5.2.8 Void

#### 4.5.2.9 Void

#### 4.5.2.10 Void

#### 4.5.2.11 Void

#### 4.5.2.12 Void

#### 4.5.2.13 Actions at the destination UE

Procedures according to 3GPP TS 24.229 \[2\] shall apply.

To indicate the barring, a destination UE which supports dynamic ICB
shall send:

\- a 603 (Decline) response including a Reason header field containing
603 Decline when the communication status is in early dialog; or

\- a BYE request including a Reason header field containing 603 Decline
when the communication status is in confirmed status; or

\- an initial INVITE request including an SSC command after the session
is released.

4.6 Interaction with other services
-----------------------------------

### 4.6.1 Communication HOLD (HOLD)

No impact, i.e. neither service shall affect the operation of the other

providing the CB service shall reject REFER requests with a refer-to
target that is barred by the conference creator\'s
Outgoing Communication Barring (OCB) rules.

If the conference creator activated the OCB service then, the AS
providing the CB service shall remove the URI that is barred by the
conference creator\'s Outgoing Communication Barring (OCB) rules from
the list of URIs in the \"recipient-list\" body of INVITE request.

### 4.6.7 Communication DIVersion services (CDIV)

If the served user has activated the ACR or ICB service, then the ACR or

4.9 Service configuration
-------------------------

### 4.9.1 Structure of the XML Document

#### 4.9.1.0 Definitions

Communication Barring documents are sub-trees of the *simservs* XML
document specified in 3GPP TS 24.623 \[6\]. As such, Communication
Barring documents use the XCAP application usage in
3GPP TS 24.623 \[6\].

**Data semantics:** The semantics of the communication barring XML
configuration document is specified in subclause 4.9.1. \"*Structure of
the XML Document*\".

**XML schema:** Implementations in compliance with the present document
shall implement the XML schema that minimally includes the XML Schema
defined in clause 4.9.2 \"*Communication Barring Rules*\" and the
*simservs* XML schema specified in subclause 6.3 of
3GPP TS 24.623 \[6\].

#### 4.9.1.1 General

In addition to the considerations and constraints defined by the
*simservs* XML document 3GPP TS 24.623 \[6\], the following additional
constraints and considerations for the Communication Barring sub-tree
are defined.

An instance of the simulation services configuration containing a
communication barring configuration document.

\<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?\>

\<simservs

xmlns=\"http://uri.etsi.org/ngn/params/xml/simservs/xcap\"

xmlns:cp=\"urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:common-policy\"

xmlns:ocp=\"urn:oma:params:xml:ns:common-policy\"\>

\<incoming-communication-barring active=\"true\"\>

*rule set*

\</incoming-communication-barring \>

\<outgoing-communication-barring active=\"true\"\>

*rule set*

\</outgoing-communication-barring \>

\</simservs\>

The communication barring service contains a rule set, which specifies
how the communication barring services react to external stimuli.

#### 4.9.1.2 Communication Barring elements

The communication barring configuration contains two communication
barring elements, one for incoming-communication-barring and one for
outgoing-communication-barring. Each barring element contains a rule
set. The rule set reuses the syntax as specified by the common policy
draft (see IETF RFC 4745 \[16\]).

Incoming-communication-barring element has the following form:

\<incoming-communication-barring active=\"true\"\>

\<cp:ruleset\>

*rule1*

*rule2*

\</cp:ruleset\>

\</incoming-communication-barring\>

Outgoing-communication-barring element has the following form:

\<outgoing-communication-barring active=\"true\"\>

\<cp:ruleset\>

r*ule3*

*rule4*

\</cp:ruleset\>

\</outgoing-communication-barring\>

For evaluating a rule set the AS shall use the algorithm as specified in
common policy draft (see IETF RFC 4745 \[16\], subclause 10.2).

In subclause 4.9.1.3 all allowed conditions are specified, communication
barring rules are always evaluated at communication setup time.

The shown \"active\" attribute is inherited from the simservType from
3GPP TS 24.623 \[6\], its meaning is also specified in
3GPP TS 24.623 \[6\].

#### 4.9.1.3 Communication Barring rules

The Communication Barring service is configured with an ordered set of
forwarding rules. The XML Schema reuses the rule syntax as specified by
common policy draft (see IETF RFC 4745 \[16\]). The rules take the
following form:

\<cp:rule id=\"*rule66*\"\>

\<cp:conditions\>

*condition1*

*condition2*

\</cp:conditions\>

\<cp:actions\>

\<allow\>false\</allow\>

\</cp:actions\>

\</cp:rule\>

When the AS providing the service processes a set of rules, the AS shall
start executing the first rule. If:

\- the rule has no \<conditions\> element;

\- the rule has an empty \<conditions\> element; or

\- conditions are present and they all evaluate to true;

then the rule matches and the specified action is executed.

Applied to the fragment above which shows the case where conditions are
present this means that only if the expression (*condition1* AND
*condition2*) evaluates to true then the *rule66* matches call is
executed, if there are more matching rules then the resulting actions
shall be combined according to the procedure specified in the common
policy draft (see IETF RFC 4745 \[16\]). If one of the matching rules
evaluates to allow=true then the resulting value shall be allow=true and
the call continues normally, otherwise the result shall be allow=false
and the call will be barred. If there are no matching rules then the
result shall be allow=true.

To create a white list of identities towards which outgoing
communications are always allowed, rules where the action is allow=true
can be created. User or operator provided white lists may be built.
Operator defined rules shall not be exposed over the Ut interface.

NOTE: Operator provided white lists are provisioned over a proprietary
interface.

The \"id\" attribute value of a rule shall uniquely identify the rule
within a rule set. This can be used in XCAP usage to address one
specific rule.

#### 4.9.1.4 Communication Barring rule conditions

The following conditions are allowed by the XML Schema for the
communication barring service.

**presence-status:** This condition evaluates to true when the called
user\'s current presence activity status is equal to the value set for
this condition. In all other cases the condition evaluates to false.

**cp:identity:** This condition evaluates to true when a provided
user\'s identity matches with the value of the identity element. The
interpretation of all the elements of this condition is described in the
common policy draft\
(see IETF RFC 4745 \[16\]). In all other cases the condition evaluates
to false.

**anonymous:** To comply with the requirements as set for simulation of
the ACR service, the *anonymous* element only evaluate to true when the
conditions as set out in subclause 4.5.2.6.2 for asserted originating
public user identity apply.

**request-name:** This condition evaluates to true when the incoming SIP
request name matches whith the value of the request-name element.

NOTE 1: The absence of this condition means that the barring rules apply
to all initial incoming requests.

**cp:sphere:** Not applicable in the context of the Communication
Barring service.

**cp:validity:** Specifies a period. The condition evaluates to true
when the current time is within the validity period expressed by the
value of this condition. In all other cases the condition evaluates to
false.

**media:** This condition evaluates to true when the value of this
condition matches the media field in one of the \"m=\" lines in
IETF RFC 4566 \[5\] offered in an INVITE request. It allows for barring
of specific media.

**communication-diverted:** This condition evaluates to true when the
incoming communication has been previously diverted.

NOTE 2: Diverted communication can be recognized by the presence of the
History-Info header field, as specified in 3GPP TS 24.604 \[9\].

**roaming:** This condition evaluates to true when the served user is
registered from an access network other then the served users home
network.

NOTE 3: Whether the served user is registered from another network then
the served users home network can be determined from the
P-Visited-Network-ID header field specified in IETF RFC 7315 \[15\] and
the P-Access-Network-Info header field specified in IETF RFC 7315 \[15\]
both are provided during the registration process, see
3GPP TS 24.229 \[2\], subclause 5.7.1.3.

**rule-deactivated:** This condition always evaluates to false. This can
be used to deactivate a rule, without loosing information. By removing
this condition the rule can be activated again.

**ocp:external-list:** This condition evaluates to true when a provided
users identity is contained in an external URI list stored in a
OMA-TS-XDM\_Shared \[17\] to which the value of external-list refers.
The exact interpretation of this element is specified in
OMA-TS-XDM\_Core \[17\].

**ocp:other-identity:** If present in any rule, the \"other-identity\"
element, which is empty, matches all identities that are not referenced
in any rule. It allows for specifying a default policy. The exact
interpretation of this condition is specified in
OMA-TS-XDM\_Core \[17\].

**international:** This condition evaluates to true when the request URI
of the outgoing SIP request:

\- corresponds to a telephone number, i.e. a SIP URI with a \"user\" URI
parameter set to \"phone\" or a tel URI; and

\- does not point to a destination served by a network within the
country where the originating user is located when initiating the
communication.

**international-exHC:** This condition for international barring,
excluding the home country, evaluates to true when the request URI of
the outgoing SIP request:

\- corresponds to a telephone number, i.e. a SIP URI with a \"user\" URI
parameter set to \"phone\" or a tel URI;

\- does not point to a destination served by a network within the
country where the originating user is located when initiating the
communication; and

\- does not point to a destination served within the served users home
network.

NOTE 4: In case of international and international-exHC, called users
subscribed to a network in the country in which the served user roams,
can be called irrespective where they roam. Subscribers, subscribed to
any network in another country than the one in which the served user is
located cannot be called even if they roam in the same network area as
the served users or in the served user\'s home network.

The condition elements that are not taken from the common policy draft
(see IETF RFC 4745 \[16\]) or OMA common policy schema
ETSI TS 183 038 \[4\] are defined in the simservs document schema
specified in 3GPP TS 24.623 \[6\].

Information of which of the above mentioned conditions the user is
allowed to use can be obtained from the network by using the schema
defined in subclause 4.9.3.

The \"serv-cap-media\" element lists the elements that can be used in
the \"media\" rule condition.

#### 4.9.1.5 Communication Barring rule actions

The action supported by the communication barring service is
(un)conditional barring of communications. For this the allow action has
been defined. The allow action takes a Boolean argument when the value
is true the communication are allowed to continue, when it is false the
communication is barred.

#### 4.9.1.6 Supported Conditions for Communication Barring

The supported conditions for communication barring are configured with a
list of condition capability elements. These capability elements are
read only and indicate which capabilities related to communication
barring the network has provisioned for a user. There is one rule
capability element per each rule condition.

EXAMPLE: An instance of the simulation services configuration containing
a service capabilities document for communication barring is shown in
the following example. In this example, the same capabilities as in Call
Barring in a CS network are supported.

######## Annex A (informative): Signalling flows

The following signalling flows show examples of the configuration and
the use of the ACR and CB services. These flows are not implying that
other scenarios are not valid.

A.1 ACR termination towards UE-B
================================

![](media/image3.wmf){width="4.871527777777778in"
height="3.4451388888888888in"}

Figure A.1.1: ACR termination towards UE-B

**1 to 2. INVITE request (UE to S-CSCF) - see example in figure A.1.1.**

The incoming INVITE request is sent to the S-CSCF serving UE-B. The
INVITE request includes a Privacy header field set to one of the
following values: \"id\" or \"header\" or \"user\".

**3. Evaluation of initial filter criteria.**

The initial Filter criteria indicates that the called user is subscribed
to the ACR service. Therefore the S-CSCF forwards the INVITE request to
the ACR AS.

**4 to 5. INVITE request (S-CSCF to AS) - see example in figure A.1.1.**

INVITE is sent to the AS.

**6 to 8. 433 (Anonymity Disallowed) response. (AS to UE) - see example
in figure A.1.1.**

AS has identified that the call is anonymous and answers with a 433
(Anonymity Disallowed) response.

**9 to 10. The originating party acknowledges the final response with
ACK.**

A.2 Service configuration
=========================

Figure A.2.1: Service configuration example

**1. HTTP GET request (UE to AP) - see example in table A.2-1**

The UE wants to retrieve the supported conditions for communication
barring from the AS.

**2. HTTP 401 (Unathorized) response (AP to UE) - see example in
table A.2-2**

Upon receiving an unauthorized HTTP GET request the AP authenticates the
UE.

**5. HTTP 200 (OK) response (AS to AP) - see example in table A.2-5**

The AS returns the supported conditions for communication barring. The
\<serv-cap-media\> child element of the \<serv-cap-conditions\> element
describes that audio and video media are allowed to be used as
Communication Barring rule conditions. The other child elements of the
\<serv-cap-conditions\> element list the conditions that are not
provisioned for the user. If a service capability for a condition is not
listed from the list of conditions specified in subclause 4.9.1.4 then
the condition is provisioned for the user. The following conditions are
provisioned: roaming, international, international-exHC.

######## Annex B (informative): Example of filter criteria 

This annex provides an example of a filter criterion that triggers SIP
requests that are subject to initial filter criteria evaluation.

When the initial request matches the conditions of the next unexecuted
IFC rule for the served user which points to the ACR service and the
P-Asserted-Identity header is set to \"id\", \"header\" or \"user\" or
\"critical\", the communication is forwarded to the AS.

An example of an Initial Filter Criteria (IFC) Trigger Point
configurations under the assumption that the ACR service is a standalone
service that can be invoked by a very specific triggerpoint active at
the destination S-CSCF:

-   (Method=\"INVITE\" AND \[Header=\"P-Asserted-Identity\"\] AND
    \[Header=\"Privacy\", Content=\"id\"\]); or

-   (Method=\"INVITE\" AND \[Header=\"P-Asserted-Identity\"\] AND
    \[Header=\"Privacy\", Content=\"header\"\]); or

-   (Method=\"INVITE\" AND \[Header=\"P-Asserted-Identity\"\] AND
    \[Header=\"Privacy\", Content=\"user\"\]); or

-   (Method=\"INVITE\" AND \[Header=\"P-Asserted-Identity\"\] AND
    \[Header=\"Privacy\", Content=\"critical\"\]).

NOTE 1: The coding of the Initial Filter Criteria is described in
3GPP TS 29.228 \[12\].

NOTE 2: In this case there is a one to one relationship with the
conditions that express the rejection cases for the ACR service as
specified in subclause 4.5.2.6.1 \"Action for ACR at the terminating
AS\".

NOTE 3: In practice it is more likely that all INVITE requests are
forwarded to the AS, because there is more services to execute then ACR
alone. This is already apparent when the combined service ACR/ICB is
deployed.

If the AS cannot suppress ICB for for a call identified as a PSAP
callback, an IFC bypassing the ICB AS can be used. An example IFC using
the PSAP callback indicator specified in IETF RFC 7090 \[21\] is:

-   Method: \"INVITE\" and not Priority header field with a
    \"psap-callback\" header field value.
