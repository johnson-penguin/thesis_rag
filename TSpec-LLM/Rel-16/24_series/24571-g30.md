4 General
=========

4.1 Overview
------------

### 4.1.1 NAS aspect

To enable transfer of Location Services (LCS) signaling messages between
the 5G core network (5GCN) and the UE, two Payload container types are
defined in the downlink (DL NAS TRANSPORT message) and the uplink (UL
NAS TRANSPORT message). The message protocol and procedures are
described in 3GPP TS 24.501 \[3\].

### 4.1.2 LCS aspect

LCS uses the defined payload container to transfer LCS signalling
messages between the UE and the network.

The corresponding LCS signaling messages include:

a\) LTE Positioning Protocol (LPP) messages (see 3GPP TS 36.355 \[4\])

\- Both downlink and uplink LPP messages are supported

\- Routing information is transported as the Additional information IE
in UL/DL NAS TRANSPORT message for LPP messages (see
3GPP TS 24.501 \[3\])

b\) Location services messages

\- Messages for MO-LR operations (see 3GPP TS 24.080 \[5\])

\- Messages for LocationNotification operations (see
3GPP TS 24.080 \[5\])

\- Messages for EventReport operations (see 3GPP TS 24.080 \[5\])

\- Messages for PeriodicTriggeredInvoke operations (see
3GPP TS 24.080 \[5\])

\- Messages for CancelDeferredLocation operations (see
3GPP TS 24.080 \[5\])

\- Messages for MSCancelDeferredLocation operations (see
3GPP TS 24.080 \[5\])

\- Messages for LocationPrivacySetting operations (see
3GPP TS 24.080 \[5\])

Routing information associated with the LMF is transported as the
Additional information IE in UL/DL NAS TRANSPORT message for Location
services messages that are transported from/to the LMF (see
3GPP TS 24.501 \[3\])

4.2 LCS Support capabilities
----------------------------

### 4.2.1 UE support of LCS

The UE announces to the network its ability to support LCS notification
mechanism or LPP messages or both, using the 5GMM capability IE defined
in 3GPP TS 24.501 \[3\].

### 4.2.2 Network support of LCS

The network announces to the UE its ability to support LCS in 5GC using
the 5GS network feature support IE defined in 3GPP TS 24.501 \[3\]. The
information is taken into account by the UE, in addition to UE\'s LCS
capabilities, for the UE to determine whether to initiate MO-LR
procedure in NG-RAN as specified in 3GPP TS 23.273 \[3\], subclause 6.2.

5 Support of LCS signalling
===========================

5.1 General
-----------

This clause defines the NG-RAN LCS operations (subclause 5.2) and the
format and coding of the messages (subclause 5.3).

The messages defined in this subclause can be transported in the UL/DL
NAS Transport message defined in 3GPP TS 24.501 \[3\].

5.2 LCS operations
------------------

### 5.2.1 Network initiated location services operations

#### 5.2.1.1 Supplementary Services Location Notification

##### 5.2.1.1.1 General

The supplementary services Location Notification operation enables the
AMF to trigger the end-user notification verification process on the UE
using NAS signalling. The supplementary services messages are
transported using the DL NAS Transport message and the UL NAS Transport
message defined in 3GPP TS 24.501 \[3\]. UE Location Privacy Indication
information may be included in Location Notification Return Result to
indicate whether subsequent LCS requests will be allowed or disallowed
by the UE. Figure 5.2.1.1.1.1 illustrates an example of the NAS
signalling transport applicable to a 5GC-MT-LR procedure for immediate
or deferred location.

Figure 5.2.1.1.1.1: NAS signalling transport for Supplementary Services
Location Notification

NOTE: The optional Additional Information IE of the DL/UL NAS Transport
message is not used when the LCS Location Notification signalling is
transported in the Payload container.

##### 5.2.1.1.2 Normal operation

The network invokes a location notification procedure by sending a
REGISTER message containing an LCS-LocationNotification invoke component
to the UE as defined in 3GPP TS 24.080 \[5\]. This may be sent either to
request verification for a 5GC-MT-LR or to notify the UE about an
already authorized 5GC-MT-LR.

In case of privacy verification, the UE shall respond to the request by
sending a RELEASE COMPLETE message containing the user\'s response and
optionally UE Location Privacy Indication information in a return result
component (see figure 5.2.1.1.2.1).

If the timer T(LCSN) defined in 3GPP TS 24.080 \[5\] expires in the
network before any response from the UE (e.g. due to no response from
the user), the network shall interpret this by applying the default
treatment defined in 3GPP TS 23.273 \[2\] (i.e. disallow location if
barred by subscription or allow location if allowed by subscription).

In the case of location notification, the UE shall terminate the
dialogue immediately by sending a RELEASE COMPLETE message containing a
LocationNotification return result.

If the UE is unable to process the request received from the network, it
shall return an error indication by sending a RELEASE COMPLETE message
containing a return error component. Error values are specified in
3GPP TS 24.080 \[5\].

#### 5.2.1.3 Supplementary Services Periodic or Triggered Location

##### 5.2.1.3.1 General

The supplementary services LCS PeriodicTriggered Invoke operation
enables the LMF to initiate periodic or triggered location event
reporting by a target UE as described in clause 6.3.1 of
3GPP TS 23.272 \[2\]. The supplementary services LCS PeriodicTriggered
Invoke message is transferred to the target UE via the serving AMF in a
DL NAS Transport message. A response from the target UE is similarly
returned to the LMF via the serving AMF and is transferred to the AMF in
an UL NAS Transport message.

Figure 5.2.1.3.1.1 illustrates an example of the NAS signalling
transport for initiation of periodic or triggered location,

Figure 5.2.1.3.1.1: NAS signalling transport for LCS PeriodicTriggered
messages

##### 5.2.1.3.2 Normal operation

The LMF sends a REGISTER message to the UE containing the supplementary
services LCS PeriodicTriggered Invoke component as defined in
3GPP TS 24.080 \[5\]. The REGISTER message is transported to the UE via
the serving AMF as described in figure 5.2.1.3.1.1.

If the UE can support the periodic or triggered location, the UE returns
a RELEASE COMPLETE message to the LMF containing an LCS
PeriodicTriggered return result. The RELEASE COMPLETE message is
transported to the LMF via the serving AMF as described in
figure 5.2.1.3.1.1.

If the UE is unable to process or support the request received from the
network, it shall return an error indication by sending a RELEASE
COMPLETE message containing a return error component or reject
component. Error values are specified in 3GPP TS 24.080 \[5\].

Figure 5.2.1.3.2.1 illustrates the signalling for normal operation
between the UE and the network.

#### 5.2.1.4 Supplementary Services Cancel Deferred Location

##### 5.2.1.4.1 General

The supplementary services Cancel Deferred Location operation enables
the AMF to cancel ongoing periodic or triggered location in a target UE
using NAS signalling as described in 3GPP TS 23.273 \[2\] clause 6.3.3.
The supplementary services Cancel Deferred Location messages are
transported using the DL NAS Transport message and the UL NAS Transport
message defined in 3GPP TS 24.501 \[3\]. Figure 5.2.1.4.1-1 illustrates
an example of the NAS signalling transport.

Figure 5.2.1.4.1.1: NAS signalling transport for Cancel Deferred
Location

NOTE: The optional Additional Information IE of the DL/UL NAS Transport
message is not used when the LCS CancelDeferredLocation signalling is
transported in the Payload container.

##### 5.2.1.4.2 Normal operation

The AMF invokes a cancel deferred location procedure by sending a
REGISTER message containing an LCS-CancelDeferredLocation invoke
component to the UE as defined in 3GPP TS 24.080 \[5\].

The UE shall terminate the ongoing periodic or triggered location if
this can be identified from the information in the
LCS-CancelDeferredLocation invoke component.

The UE shall then return a RELEASE COMPLETE message containing an
LCS-CancelDeferredLocation return result component (see
figure 5.2.1.4.2.1).

If the UE is unable to process the request received from the network or
cannot identify the ongoing periodic or triggered location to be
terminated, it shall return an error indication by sending a RELEASE

### 5.2.2 Mobile initiated location services operations

#### 5.2.2.1 Mobile Originiated Location Request(MO-LR)

##### 5.2.2.1.1 General

The supplementary services MO-LR operation enables the UE to launch MO
positioning session or request location assistance data using NAS
signaling. The NAS signaling are transported using the DL NAS Transport
message and the Uplink NAS Transport message defined in
3GPP TS 24.501 \[3\]. Figure 5.2.2.1.1-1 illustrates an example of the
NAS signaling transport for an MO-LR session.

Figure 5.2.2.1.1-1: NAS signaling transport for MO-LR

NOTE: The optional Additional Information IE of the UL/DL NAS TRANSPORT
message is not used when the MO-LR signaling is transported in the
Payload container.

##### 5.2.2.1.2 Normal operation

The UE invokes a MO-LR by sending a REGISTER message to the network
containing a LCS-MOLR invoke component. SS Version Indicator value 1 or
above shall be used.

The receiving network entity shall initiate the handling of location
request in the network. The network shall pass the result of the
location procedure to the UE by sending a FACILITY message to the UE
containing a LCS-MOLR return result component. When location estimate is
kept in the network entity and this information satisfies the requested
accuracy and the requested maximum age of location, then the network may
reuse this information and the positioning measurement procedure may be
skipped.

The network shall pass the result of the location procedure to the UE
only if the location estimate is given in a format that the UE supports,
as indicated by either the presence (and content) or the absence of the
parameter supportedGADShapes, which may be sent by the UE in the
LCS-MOLR operation.

The UE may terminate the dialogue by sending a RELEASE COMPLETE message
in the case of single location request (see figure 5.2.2.1.1-1). The UE
may also initiate another location request operation by sending a
FACILITY message to the network containing a LCS-MOLR invoke component
(see figure 5.2.2.1.1-2). After the last location request operation the
UE shall terminate the dialogue by sending a RELEASE COMPLETE message.

If the network is unable to successfully fulfil the request received
from the UE (e.g. to provide a location estimate or location assistance
information), it shall clear the transaction by sending a RELEASE
COMPLETE message containing a return error component. Error values are
specified in 3GPP TS 24.080 \[5\]. If the network is unable to provide a
location estimate due to lack of support in the UE for the type of shape
of the location estimate, then it shall use the error Facility Not
Supported.

If the network has returned a result to the UE in a FACILITY message
but, after some PLMN administered time period has elapsed, has not
received either a new location request operation in a FACILITY message
or a RELEASE COMPLETE message from the UE, the network may clear the
transaction by sending a RELEASE COMPLETE message.

During the MO-LR operation the UE shall run a timer T(LCSL). This timer
is started when the operation is sent, and stopped when a response is
received from the network. If this timer expires the UE shall assume
that the operation has failed, and may terminate the dialogue by sending
a RELEASE COMPLETE message, and shall inform the user of the failure.

#### 5.2.2.5 UE Location Privacy Setting Procedure

##### 5.2.2.5.1 General

The supplmentary services LocationPrivacySetting operation enables the
UE to update the UE Location Privacy Indication information via UE
Location Privacy Setting procedure as described in clause 6.12.1 of
3GPP TS 23.273 \[2\] when the UE has generated or updated the UE
Location Privacy Indication. The supplementary services
LocationPrivacySetting message is transferred to the serving AMF in a UL
NAS TRANSPORT message and an acknowledgement from the serving AMF may be
returned to the UE in DL NAS TRANSPORT message defined in
3GPP TS 24.501 \[3\].

Figure 5.2.2.5.1-1 illustrates an example of the NAS signalling
transport for UE Location Privacy Setting procedure,

Figure 5.2.2.5.1-1: NAS signalling transport for LocationPrivacySetting
messages

##### 5.2.2.5.2 Normal operation

The UE invokes a Location Privacy Setting procedure by sending a
REGISTER message containing an LocationPrivacySetting message as defined
in 3GPP TS 24.080 \[5\]. UE\'s Location Privacy Indication information
is included in LocationPrivacySetting message.

The AMF shall transfers the UE Location Privacy Indication information
in LocationPrivacySetting message to UDM and response a supplementary
services acknowledgement of LocationPrivacyIndication message

The AMF shall then return a RELEASE COMPLETE message containing a
LocationPrivacySetting Acknowledgement component (see figure
5.2.2.5.2-1) if it can handle this LocationPrivacySetting message
correctly.

If the AMF is unable to process the request received from the UE or can
not identify that provisioning the parameters of UE Location Privacy
Setting information to UDM is executed successfully, it shall return an
error indication by sending a RELEASE COMPLETE message containing a
return error component. Error values are specified in
3GPP TS 24.080 \[5\].

#### 5.2.2.6 UE initiated Event Reporting Procedure for Low Power Event Reporting and Triggered 5GC-MT-LR

##### 5.2.2.6.1 General

The supplementary services EventReport operation enables the UE to
report the periodic or triggered location event invoked by the LMF via
LCS PeriodicTriggered Invoke operation as described in clause 6.7.1 of
3GPP TS 23.273 \[2\] when certain events are detected in the UE and when
the UE supports and the LMF allows the use of Control Plane CIoT 5GS
Optimisation. The supplementary services EventReport message is
transferred to the LMF via the serving AMF in a CONTROL PLANE SERVICE
REQUEST message defined in 3GPP TS 24.501 \[3\]. A response from the LMF
may be returned to the UE via the serving AMF and be transferred to the
UE in a DL NAS TRANSPORT message defined in 3GPP TS 24.501 \[3\].

Figure 5.2.2.x.1-1 illustrates an example of the NAS signalling
transport for EventReport messages,

Figure 5.2.2.6.1-1: NAS signalling transport for EventReport messages
using Low Power Event Reporting and Triggered 5GC-MT-LR

##### 5.2.2.6.2 Normal operation

Normal operation is as described for the UE initiated Event Reporting
Procedure in clause 5.2.2.4.2.

5.3 LCS message and coding
--------------------------

### 5.3.1 Messages for Location services operations

The LCS message format and information elements coding for the MO-LR,
LocationNotification, EventReport, PeriodicTriggeredInvoke,
CancelDeferredLocation and LocationPrivacySetting operations
(subclause 5.2) are defined in 3GPP TS 24.080 \[5\] for the following
messages:

\- Register message

\- Facility message

\- Release Complete message

### 5.3.2 Messages for LTE Positioning Protocol (LPP)

#### 5.3.2.1 Downlink Positioning Information Transport using LPP messages

The AMF shall set the Payload container type to \"LPP message
container\" in the DL NAS TRANSPORT message.

The AMF includes a Routing Identifier in the Additional information IE
of the DL NAS TRANSPORT message which identifies the LMF and the
positioning session between the AMF and LMF when a positioning session
is being used.

The Routing identifier is the Correlation ID, which is defined in
3GPP TS 29.572 \[6\], so that the AMF can map the Routing identifier to
the LMF and the Correlation identifier when the AMF receives a UL NAS
TRANSPORT message including the responding LPP message.

#### 5.3.2.2 Uplink Positioning Information Transport using LPP messages

The UE shall set the Payload container type to \"LPP message container\"
in the UL NAS TRANSPORT message.

The UE includes a Routing Identifier received in the Additional
Information IE of the DL NAS TRANSPORT message in the Additional
Information IE of the UL NAS TRANSPORT message. This association of the
Routing Identifier is provided at the LPP level: the UL NAS TRANSPORT
message carries an LPP message that is a response to or instigated by
the LPP message in the DL NAS TRANSPORT message. The Routing identifier
is the Correlation ID, which is defined in 3GPP TS 29.572 \[6\], so that
the AMF can map the Routing identifier to the Correlation identifier
when the AMF receives the UL NAS TRANSPORT message.
