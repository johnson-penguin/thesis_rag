 Foreword
========

This Technical Specification has been produced by the 3rd Generation
Partnership Project (3GPP).

The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work
within the TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the
TSG modify the contents of the present document, it will be re-released
by the TSG with an identifying change of release date and an increase in
version number as follows:

Version x.y.z

where:

x the first digit:

1 presented to TSG for information;

2 presented to TSG for approval;

3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.

y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e.
technical enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.

z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been
incorporated in the document.

In the present document, modal verbs have the following meanings:

**shall** indicates a mandatory requirement to do something

**shall not** indicates an interdiction (prohibition) to do something

The constructions \"shall\" and \"shall not\" are confined to the
context of normative provisions, and do not appear in Technical Reports.

The constructions \"must\" and \"must not\" are not used as substitutes
for \"shall\" and \"shall not\". Their use is avoided insofar as
possible, and they are not used in a normative context except in a
direct citation from an external, referenced, non-3GPP document, or so
as to maintain continuity of style when extending or modifying the
provisions of such a referenced document.

**should** indicates a recommendation to do something

**should not** indicates a recommendation not to do something

**may** indicates permission to do something

**need not** indicates permission not to do something

The construction \"may not\" is ambiguous and is not used in normative
elements. The unambiguous constructions \"might not\" or \"shall not\"
are used instead, depending upon the meaning intended.

**can** indicates that something is possible

**cannot** indicates that something is impossible

The constructions \"can\" and \"cannot\" are not substitutes for \"may\"
and \"need not\".

**will** indicates that something is certain or expected to happen as a
result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside
the scope of the present document

**will not** indicates that something is certain or expected not to
happen as a result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which
is outside the scope of the present document

**might** indicates a likelihood that something will happen as a result
of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document

**might not** indicates a likelihood that something will not happen as a
result of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside
the scope of the present document

In addition:

**is** (or any other verb in the indicative mood) indicates a statement
of fact

**is not** (or any other negative verb in the indicative mood) indicates
a statement of fact

The constructions \"is\" and \"is not\" do not indicate requirements.

 1 Scope
=======

The present document specifies the protocol aspects for the location
management capability of SEAL to support vertical applications (e.g.
V2X) over the 3GPP system.

The present document is applicable to the user equipment (UE) supporting
the location management client functionality as described in 3GPP
TS 23.434 \[4\], to the application server supporting the location
management server functionality as described in 3GPP TS 23.434 \[4\] and
to the application server supporting the vertical application server
(VAL server) functionality as defined in the specific vertical
application service (VAL service) specifications.

NOTE: The specification of the VAL server for a specific VAL service is
out of scope of present document.

### 6.2.2 Event-triggered location reporting procedure

#### 6.2.2.1 General

The SLM-C sends a location reporting configuration request when it needs
to fetch location reporting configuration from the SLM-S.

The SLM-C sends a location report when at least one of the trigger
criteria is fulfilled. To send the location report the SLM-C can use an
appropriate HTTP request message.

If a location reporting trigger is met, the SLM-C checks if the
minimum-report-interval timer is running. If the timer is running, the
SLM-C waits until the timer expires. When the minimum-report-interval
timer expires, the SLM-C:

a\) shall send a location information report as specified in
clause 6.2.2.2, if any of the reporting triggers are still met.

#### 6.2.2.2 Client procedure

##### 6.2.2.2.1 Fetching location reporting configuration

In order to fetch location reporting configuration, the SLM-C shall send
an HTTP GET request message according to procedures specified in
IETF RFC 2616 \[7\] \"Fetch a Document\". In the HTTP GET request
message, the SLM-C:

a\) shall set the Request-URI to the URI identifying the XML document to
be fetched. In the Request-URI;

7.5 Data semantics
------------------

The \<location-info\> element is the root element of the XML document.
The \<location-info\> element contains the \<identity\>,
\<subscription\>, \<request\>, \<configuration\> and \<report\>
sub-elements.

\<identity\> is a mandatory element used to include the identity of a
VAL user, a VAL client or a VAL group. The \<identity\> element contains
one of following sub-elements:

a\) \<VAL-user-id\>, an element contains the identity of the VAL user.
This element contains an optional \<VAL-client-id\> attribute that
contains the identity of the VAL client; or

b\) \<VAL-group-id\>, an element contains the group identity of a set of
VAL users or VAL clients according to the VAL service.

\<subscription\> contains the following sub-elements:

a\) \<identities-list\>, an element contains one or more \<VAL-user-id\>
elements. Each \<VAL-user-id\> element contains the identity of the VAL
user whose location information is requested.

b\) \<time-interval-length\>, an element specifying the interval time
the SLM-S needs to wait before sending location reports. The value is
given in seconds.

c\) \<subscription-identifier\>, an element specifying the value to
uniquely identify the subscription.

d\) \<expiry-time\>, an element specifying expiry time for subscription
in seconds.

\<notification\> contains the following sub-elements:

a\) \<identities-list\>, an element contains one or more \<VAL-user-id\>
elements. Each \<VAL-user-id\> element contains the identity of the VAL
user whose location information needs to be notified.

b\) \<trigger-id\>, an element which can occur multiple times that
contains the value of the \<trigger-id\> attribute associated with a
trigger that has fired; and

c\) \<reports\>, an element contains one or more \<loc-info-report\>
elements. Each \<loc-info-report\> element contains the following
sub-elements:

1\) \<VAL-user-id\>, an element contains the identity of a VAL user in
the identities list;

2\) \<latest-location \>, an element contains at least one of the
following sub-elements:

i\) \<latest-serving-NCGI\>, an optional element containing the NR cell
global identity (NCGI) of the serving cell coded as specified in
clause 19.6A in 3GPP TS 23.003 \[2\];

ii\) \<neighbouring-NCGI\>, an optional element that can occur multiple
times. It contains the NCGI of any neighbouring cell the SLM-C can
detect;

iii\) \<mbms-service-area-id\>, an optional element containing the MBMS
service area id the SLM-C is using coded as specified in clause 15.3 in
3GPP TS 23.003 \[2\] for service area identifier (SAI);

iv\) \<mbsfn-area\> element, an optional element specifying that the
MBSFN area Id needs to be reported; and

v\) \<latest-coordinate\>, an optional element containing the longitude
and latitude coded as specified in clause 6.1 in 3GPP TS 23.032 \[3\];

\<report\> is a mandatory element used to include the location report.
It contains a \<report-id\> attribute. The \<report-id\> attribute is
used to return the value in the \<request-id\> attribute in the
\<request\> element. The \<report\> element contains the following
sub-elements:

a\) \<trigger-id\>, a mandatory element which can occur multiple times
that contain the value of the \<trigger-id\> attribute associated with a
trigger that has fired; and

b\) \<current-location\>, a mandatory element that contains the location
information. The \<current-location\> element contains the following
sub-elements:

1\) \<current-serving-NCGI\>, an optional element containing the NR cell
global identity (NCGI) of the serving cell coded as specified in
clause 19.6A in 3GPP TS 23.003 \[2\];

2\) \<neighbouring-NCGI\>, an optional element that can occur multiple
times. It contains the NCGI of any neighbouring cell the SLM-C can
detect;

3\) \<mbms-service-area-id\>, an optional element containing the MBMS
service area id the SLM-C is using coded as specified in clause 15.3 in
3GPP TS 23.003 \[2\] for service area identifier (SAI); and

4\) \<current-coordinate\>, an optional element containing the longitude
and latitude coded as specified in clause 6.1 in 3GPP TS 23.032 \[3\].

\<request\> is an element with a \<request-id\> attribute. The
\<request\> element is used to request a location report. The value of
the \<request-id\> attribute is returned in the corresponding
\<report-id\> attribute in order to correlate the request and the
report.

\<requested-identity\> is a mandatory element used to include the
identity of a VAL user, a VAL client or a VAL group for which a location
report is requested. The \<requested-identity\> element contains one of
following sub-elements:

a\) \<VAL-user-id\>, an element contains the identity of the VAL user.
This element contains an optional \<VAL-client-id\> attribute that
contains the identity of the VAL client; or

b\) \<VAL-group-id\>, an element contains the group identity of a set of
VAL users or VAL clients according to the VAL service.

\<configuration\> is an element with a \<configuration-scope\> attribute
that can have the value \"Full\" or \"Update\" . The value \"Full\"
means that the \<configuration\> element contains the full location
configuration which replaces any previous location configuration. The
value \"Update\" means that the location configuration is an addition to
any previous location configuration. To remove configuration elements a
\"Full\" configuration is needed. The \<configuration\> element contains
the following sub-elements:

a\) \<location-information\>, an optional element that specifies the
location information. The \<location-information\> has the sub-elements:

1\) \<serving-NCGI\>, an optional element containing the NR cell global
identity (NCGI) of the serving cell coded as specified in clause 19.6A
in 3GPP TS 23.003 \[2\];

2\) \<neighbouring-NCGI\>, an optional element that can occur multiple
times. It contains the NCGI of any neighbouring cell the SLM-C can
detect;

3\) \<mbms-service-area-id\>, an optional element containing the MBMS
service area id that the SLM-C is using. The MBMS service area id is
coded as specified in clause 15.3 in 3GPP TS 23.003 \[2\] for service
area identifier (SAI);

########  Annex A (normative): Timers

A.1 General
===========

This clause provides a brief description of the timers used in this
specification.

A.2 On network timers
=====================

The table A.2-1 provides a description of the timers used in this
specification, specifies the timer values, describes the reason for
starting of the timer, normal stop and the action on expiry.

Table A.2-1: On network timers

  Timer                           Timer value                                                                                                 Cause of start                                                                                           Normal stop                                                                 On expiry
  ------------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  TLM-1 (subscription expiry)     The timer value is negotiated between SLM-C and SLM-S while creating or modifying subscription.             The SLM-S starts the timer upon sending response to create subscription request message towards SLM-C;   On sending response to delete subscription request message towards SLM-C;   Consider that the subscription associated with the timer is terminated and shall delete all data related to the subscription.
  TLM-2 (notification interval)   The timer value is set by user in create subscription request message in \<time-interval-length\>element.   The SLM-S starts timer each time after sending location information notification.                        On sending response to delete subscription request message towards SLM-C;   If any location information data is pending to be notified then the SLM-S sends the notification.
