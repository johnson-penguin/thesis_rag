4 Malicious Communication Identification (MCID)
===============================================

4.1 Introduction
----------------

The MCID service will store session related information of incoming
communications independent of the service requested. The following
communication information shall be registered:

\- Destination Party Identity Information;

\- originating Party Identity Information; and

\- local time and date of the invocation in the network serving the
called user.

The communication information shall not be available to the terminal
equipment under the control of the called user nor the originating user.
The communication information shall be stored at a location(s) under the
control of the network operator. In order for the MCID service to
operate when two networks are involved both networks need to be within
the same trust domain for identity information transfer.

A network subscription option can be provided which allows automatic
invocation of MCID service on communications to the served user which
are not answered.

*NOTE*: The purpose of this option is to allow for registration of
communications that ring for a short time only.

A user subscription option can be provided where the MCID service can
either be invoked during the active phase of the communication, or for a
limited period after the communication has ceased.

4.2 Description
---------------

### 4.2.1 General description

The Malicious Communication Identification (MCID) service allows the
service provider to trace the identity information of the source of an
incoming communication on request of the destination user.

4.3 Operational requirements
----------------------------

### 4.3.1 Provision/withdrawal

This service shall be provided and withdrawn after pre-arrangement with
the service provider, in accordance with national legal requirements.

This service has two modes: permanent mode and temporary mode. In
permanent mode the MCID service is invoked for all incoming
communications, and in temporary mode the MCID service is invoked only
for the incoming communications declared by the served user.

As a network option, the MCID service can be offered with several
subscription options. A network providing the MCID service shall support
permanent mode at a minimum. Subscription options are summarized in
table 4.3.1.1.

Table 4.3.1.1: Subscription options for MCID services

  ---------------------- -----------------
  Subscription options   Value

  Mode                   Permanent Mode\
                         Temporary Mode
  ---------------------- -----------------

### 4.3.2 Requirements on the originating network side

No specific requirements are needed in the originating network.

### 4.3.3 Void

Void.

### 4.3.4 Requirements on the terminating network side

No specific requirements are needed in the terminating network.

NOTE: If the subscriber has a permanent or case by case subscription,
based on Initial Filter Criteria (IFC) the INVITE request is forwarded
to the AS that provides the MCID service. Annex B provides an example on
how an Initial Filter Criteria (IFC) can be configured.

4.4 Coding requirements
-----------------------

The present clause defines the XML Schema to be used for providing the
MCID Request/Response and to invoke the temporary mode of the MCID
Service.

The application/vnd.etsi.mcid+xml MIME type used to provide request of a
missing originating ID and the delivery of the requested originating id
AS of the served user shall be coded as following described:

\<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?\>

4.5 Signalling requirements
---------------------------

### 4.5.1 Activation/deactivation

The MCID service is provisioned only by the network operator. The MCID
service is activated at provisioning and de-activated at withdrawal.

4.5.1a Registration/erasure

The MCID service requires no registration. Erasure is not applicable.

4.5.1b Interrogation

Interrogation of MCID is not applicable.

### 4.5.2 Invocation and operation

#### 4.5.2.1 Actions at the originating UE

Basic communication procedures according to 3GPP TS 24.229 \[2\] shall
apply.

#### 4.5.2.2 Void

#### 4.5.2.3 Void

#### 4.5.2.4 Void

#### 4.5.2.5 Actions at the AS of the terminating user

##### 4.5.2.5.0 General

The AS shall at the minimum store the following elements of a received
INVITE request:

\- Destination Party Identity Information included in the Request-URI;

\- Originating Party Identity Information included in the
P-Asserted-Identity header field, if the\
P-Asserted-Identity header field is included in the request;

\- local time and date of the invocation in the network serving the
called user;

\- call diversion information (\"cause\" SIP URI parameter) received in
the History-Info header field, if included in the request;

\- Referred-By header field when available;

\- Contact header field;

\- To header field; and

\- From header field.

NOTE: The Originating Party Identity Information included in the
P-Asserted-Identity header field is always present in the INVITE request
if the request is originated in a trusted network.

If the INVITE request does not contain the information of the
originating party, the AS shall send an INFO request including an
Identification Request MIME body.

When receiving the INFO request containing identification information,
the AS shall in addition to the already stored information elements of
the earlier received INVITE request, at the minimum store the
information as received in the body of the INFO request.

##### 4.5.2.5.1 Subscriber has a permanent subscription

The AS shall register stored information. The exact procedure to
register the information is implementation dependent and out of scope of
the present document.

4.5.2.5.2 Subscriber has a temporary subscription

The AS shall store the required elements of a received INVITE request
for a limited period after the communication has been released. If an
initial INVITE request as specified in subclause 4.5.2.12.1 is received
during this period the AS shall register the stored information as in
subclause 4.5.2.5.1. If no MCID request is received during that period
the stored elements for the last communication can be deleted.

A received reINVITE request of the served user as defined in
subclause 4.5.2.12.1 is identified as MCID request and the AS shall
register the required information.

The exact procedure to register the information is implementation
dependent and out of scope of the present document.

After receiving a BYE request from the originating side the call state
shall be held for a current time defined by Timer\
TMCID-BYE.

With expiry of the TMCID-BYE the BYE request shall be forwarded to the
served user and the communication shall be released according to the
basic communication procedures defined in 3GPP TS 24.229 \[2\].

If no MCID request was received the stored elements for the last
communication can be deleted.

4.5.2.5.3 Request of a missing or incomplete originating Id (network
option)

The present subclause is applicable when interacting with the PSTN/ISDN.

If a received initial INVITE request does not contain an originating
identification or a incomplete originating identification and only if
requested by operator policy regarding the received P-Asserted-Identity
header field, the AS shall send a INFO request containing a XML mcid
body with MCID XML Request schema requesting the originating ID towards
the originating network. If requested by operator policy and proprietary
signalling, the AS shall skip sending the INFO request containing a XML
mcid body with MCID XML Request schema and continue with the session
setup as defined in 3GPP TS 24.229 \[2\].

NOTE: The received P-Asserted-Identity header field can contain a
specific value indicating to skip sending INFO requests as the INFO
request can indicate the request for identity towards the originating
UA. The specific content of the P-Asserted-identity header field that
triggers this behaviour is operator specific and is outside the scope of
this specification.

After sending of the INFO request requesting the originating id, timer
TO-ID (as defined in subclause 4.8) is started.

When the Identification response (INFO request containing a XML mcid
body with MCID XML Response schema containing the originating identity)
is received:

\- the timer TO-ID is stopped; and

\- the MCID information is stored;and

\- a 180 (Ringing) response is sent towards the originating user
according to the basic communication procedures.

When a Identification response INFO request is received without the
Originating Party Identity information:

\- timer TO-ID is stopped; and

\- a 180 (Ringing) response is sent towards the originating user
according to the basic communication procedures.

When the timer TO-ID expires before an Identification response INFO
request is received, a 180 (Ringing) response is sent towards the
originating user according to the basic communication procedures.

#### 4.5.2.6 Void

#### 4.5.2.7 Void

#### 4.5.2.8 Void

#### 4.5.2.9 Void

#### 4.5.2.10 Void

#### 4.5.2.11 Void

#### 4.5.2.12 Actions at the destination UE

##### 4.5.2.12.0 Subscriber has a permanent subscription

Basic communication procedures according to 3GPP TS 24.229 \[2\] shall
apply.

##### 4.5.2.12.1 Subscriber has a temporary subscription

In order to invoke the MCID service during the call the UE shall send a
reINVITE request including a XML MIME with XML mcid body with MCID XML
Request schema containing a McidRequestIndicator set to 1.

As a network operator option, the UE can skip including the XML MIME
with XML mcid body in the reINVITE.

NOTE: A reINVITE request without the XML MIME with XML mcid body can not
be clearly identified as a trigger for the MCID service in an AS and
therefore this reINVITE request will be sent towards the originating
side. Additionally, if this network option is chosen, the AS will
register MCID data for every reINVITE that the UE sends.

In order to invoke the MCID service after a completed call, the UE shall
send an initial INVITE request in accordance with 3GPP TS 24.229 \[2\]
and include a Request-URI set to an operator specific URI provided by
the user, and in the SDP offer media for which the UE can receive an
announcement.

4.6 Interaction with other services
-----------------------------------

### 4.6.1 Communication Hold (HOLD)

No impact, i.e. neither service shall affect the operation of the other
service.

### 4.6.2 Terminating Identification Presentation (TIP)

No impact, i.e. neither service shall affect the operation of the other
service.

### 4.6.3 Terminating Identification Restriction (TIR)

No impact, i.e. neither service shall affect the operation of the other
service.

### 4.6.4 Originating Identification Presentation (OIP)

No impact, i.e. neither service shall affect the operation of the other
service.

### 4.6.5 Originating Identification Restriction (OIR)

Even if the originating identification is a secret (restricted)
identification, MCID invocation is possible.

### 4.6.6 Conference (CONF)

No impact, i.e. neither service shall affect the operation of the other
service.

### 4.6.7 Communication Diversion Services (CDIV)

The MCID service can be invoked for a diverted communication. In
addition to the normal operation of the MCID service, the identity of
the first diverting user shall be registered and, as a network option,
the last diverting user can be registered.

#### 4.6.7.1 Communication Forwarding Unconditional (CFU)

If the served user has activated CFU service, once forwarding has taken
place, the forwarding user cannot invoke the MCID service.

#### 4.6.7.2 Communication Forwarding Busy (CFB)

If the served user has activated CFB, once forwarding has taken place,
the forwarding user cannot invoke the MCID service.

#### 4.6.7.3 Communication Forwarding No Reply (CFNR)

If the served user has activated CFNR, once forwarding has taken place,
the forwarding user (served user) cannot invoke the MCID service.

The MCID service shall not be automatically invoked when an alerting
communication is terminated due to the invocation of the communication
forwarding no reply service.

#### 4.6.7.4 Communication Forwarding on Not Logged-In (CFNL)

If the served user has activated CFNL, once forwarding has taken place,
the forwarding user (served user) cannot invoke the MCID service even
after a log-in procedure.

The MCID service shall not be automatically invoked when an alerting
communication is terminated due to the invocation of the communication
forwarding not logged in service.

#### 4.6.7.5 Communication Deflection (CD)

If the served user has activated communication deflection, once
deflection has taken place, the deflecting user cannot invoke the MCID
service.

The MCID service shall not be automatically invoked when an alerting
communication is terminated due to the invocation of the communication
deflection service.

### 4.6.8 Call Waiting (CW)

No impact, i.e. neither service shall affect the operation of the other
service.

### 4.6.9 Anonymous Communication Rejection and Communication session Barring (ACR/CB)

No impact, i.e. neither service shall affect the operation of the other
service.

### 4.6.10 Explicit Communication Transfer (ECT)

If the transferor invokes the malicious communication identification
service on an initial communication after that communication has been
successfully transferred then the AS will reject the request.

### 4.6.11 Enhanced Calling Name (eCNAM)

No impact. Neither service shall affect the operation of the other
service.

### 4.6.12 Multi-Device (MuD)

No impact. Neither service shall affect the operation of the other
service.

### 4.6.13 Multi-Identity (MiD)

No impact. Neither service shall affect the operation of the other
service.

NOTE: If the originating user has activated the MiD service and if the
operator policy and regulatory requirements state that for the
originating request the P-Asserted-Identity header field cannot be
modified, identities from the P-Asserted-Identity header field and the
From header field stored by the MCID service can represent different
users.

4.7 Interactions with other networks
------------------------------------

### 4.7.1 Void

### 4.7.2 Void

### 4.7.3 Void

4.8 Parameter values (timers)
-----------------------------

A new timer is identified in the destination exchange:

Timer TO-ID: 4-15 seconds.

Timer TO-ID is initiated only at the AS of the served user after sending
an MCID request in an INFO request and is stopped at the receipt of an
INFO request containing a XML mcid body with MCID XML Response schema.

At expiry of the timer, the communication continues according to the
basic communication procedures.

A new timer is identified in the AS to count the post time for invoking
the MCID temporary mode.

Timer TMCID-BYE: recommended 0-120 seconds. The timer value is defined
by the Operator.

Timer TMCID-BYE initiated only at the AS of the served user after
receiving a CANCEL request or BYE request.

At expiry of the timer, the communication continues shall be released
according to the basic communication procedures defined in
3GPP TS 24.229 \[2\].

######## Annex A (informative): Signalling Flows 

A.1 MCID invocation
-------------------

The MCID invokes, in the destination, the storage of data.

Figure A.1 shows an example signalling flow for the scenario.

![](media/image3.wmf){width="5.084722222222222in"
height="4.510416666666667in"}

Figure A.1: MCID Permanent and triggered by the B user

The steps of the flow are as follows:

1\) INVITE request (to S-CSCF).

The INVITE request is sent from the UE to S-CSCF. The INVITE request
includes P-Asserted-Identity header fields as follows:

\- P-Asserted-Identity: \"John Doe\" \<tel:+1-212-555-1111\>;

\- Privacy header field: id or Privacy header or Privacy user; and

\- P-Asserted-Identity: \"John Doe\" \<sip:user1\_public1\@home1.net\>.

2\) 100 (Trying) response (from S-CSCF).

3\) Evaluation of initial filter criteria.

The initial Filter criteria identifies that the requested URI is
subscribed to the MCID service. Therefore the S-CSCF forwards the INVITE
request to the MCID AS.

4\) INVITE request (S-CSCF to AS).

INVITE request is send to the AS.

5\) 100 (Trying) response from S-CSCF.

6\) AS stores Data.

7-12) INVITE request (S-CSCF to AS).

INVITE request is send towards the UE:B.

A.2 Identity information not present in the initial request
-----------------------------------------------------------

Hereby, we show a PSTN to IMS scenario, but notice that any call,
originated in the PSTN domain and being diverted before reaching the
served user AS, must be treated in the same manner. The terminating AS
sends a 18x provisional response previous to sending a SIP INFO request,
which requests the information from the originating network. It can then
route the call while waiting for an answer to the INFO request. Note
that the 18x response is sent reliably, this is not intended to indicate
ringing (not be a 180 (Ringing) response), and contains no SDP. This 18x
response establishes a early dialog, which is needed before the INFO
request can be sent.

Figure A.2.1:MCID with Information Request towards the ISDN/PSTN

The Terminating AS will then wait for an INFO request containing the
response to the information query in the previous INFO request. This
request provides the requested identity. If such a request is not
received within a period of time, the service cannot be provided.

A.3 MCID invocation during the call in temporary mode
-----------------------------------------------------

The MCID invokes, in the destination, the storage of data.

Figure A.3.1 shows an example signalling flow for the scenario.

The steps of the flow are as follows:

1\) INVITE request (to S-CSCF).

The INVITE request is sent from the UE to S-CSCF The INVITE request
includes a P-Asserted-Identity header fields as follows:

\- P-Asserted-Identity: \"John Doe\" \<tel:+1-212-555-1111\>, \"John
Doe\" \<sip:user1\_public1\@home1.net\>;

\- Privacy header field: id or Privacy header or Privacy user.

2\) 100 (Trying) response (from S-CSCF).

3\) Evaluation of initial filter criteria.

The initial Filter criteria identifies that the requested URI is
subscribed to the MCID service. Therefore the S-CSCF forwards the INVITE
request to the MCID AS.

4\) INVITE request (S-CSCF to AS).

INVITE request is send to the AS.

5\) 100 (Trying) response from S-CSCF.

6\) Temporarily AS stores Data.

AS stores:

\- Request URI.

\- To header field.

\- P-Asserted-Identity header fields.

\- From header field.

\- Contact header field.

\- Time and date field.

7-12) INVITE request (S-CSCF to AS).

INVITE request is send towards the UE:B.

NOTE: 180 (Ringing) response is not shown.

13-18) UE-B takes the communication. A 200 (OK) response is sent towards
UE-A.

19\) UE-B initiates the temporary mode with sending a reINVITE request -
see example in table A.3-19.

23\) The AS finally stores the regarding MCID data cached at step 6).

######## Annex B (informative): Example of filter criteria 

This annex provides an example of a filter criterion that triggers SIP
requests that are subject to initial filter criteria evaluation.

**The coding of the Initial Filter Criteria is described in**
3GPP TS 29.228 \[9\].

B.1 Terminating S-CSCF
======================

If a user identified by the Request-URI is provided with the MCID
service the IFC can be:

The S-CSCF forwards all INVITE requests to the AS providing the MCID
service.

B.2 Originating S-CSCF
----------------------

For an originating user identified as provided with the MCID service the
IFC can be:

The S-CSCF forwards all INVITE request with an operator defined service
URI to the AS providing the MCID service.
