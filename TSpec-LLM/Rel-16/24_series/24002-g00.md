1 Scope
=======

The present document describes the reference configuration for access to
a PLMN.

A user accesses a PLMN via a number of interfaces, including the MS-BS
(in A/Gb mode and GERAN Iu mode), UE-UTRAN (in UTRAN Iu mode),
UE-E-UTRAN, and UE-5G-AN interface. The purpose of this document is to
indicate the possible access arrangements that may be used in
conjunction with the MS-BS (in A/Gb mode and GERAN Iu mode), UE-UTRAN
(in UTRAN Iu mode), UE-E-UTRAN, and UE-5G-AN interface.

-----------------

Abbreviations used in the present document are listed in
3GPP TR 21.905 \[39\].

2 General definitions
=====================

The following definitions 2.1-2.3 are based on those used for ISDN.

2.1 Reference Configurations
----------------------------

Reference Configurations are conceptual configurations useful in
identifying access arrangements to a network. Two concepts are used in
defining reference configurations:

reference points and functional groups.

2.2 Functional Groups
---------------------

Functional Groups are sets of functions which may be needed in network
access arrangements. In a particular access arrangement, specific
functions in a functional group may or may not be present. Specific
functions in a functional group may be performed in one or more pieces
of equipment.

2.3 Reference Points
--------------------

Reference Points are the conceptual points dividing functional groups.
In a specific access arrangement, a reference point may correspond to a
physical interface between pieces of equipment, or there may not be any
physical interface corresponding to the reference point.

2.4 Interface Points 
--------------------

Interface Points are reference points within a PLMN at which a 3GPP
specified interface is always identified.

2.5 Terminal Definitions
------------------------

The term \'mobile station\' ( MS ) in the present document is synonymous
with the term \'user equipment\' (UE ) in 3G terminology as defined in
3GPP TR 21.905 \[39\].

The term \'TE2\' in the present document is synonymous with the term
\'TE\' in 3G terminology as defined in 3GPP TR 21.905 \[39\].

The term \'MT2\' in the present document is synonymous with the term
\'MT\' in 3G terminology as defined in 3GPP TR 21.905 \[39\].

3 Reference Configuration
=========================

3.0 General
-----------

The reference configuration for PLMN (in A/Gb mode and GERAN Iu mode)
access interfaces is shown in figure 1.

![](media/image4.png){width="0.3854166666666667in"
height="0.23958333333333334in"}: reference point.

TE2: V -type terminal.

TA: Terminal Adaptor.

GERAN: GSM/EDGE Radio Access Network.

CN: Core Network.

Figure 1: PLMN Access Reference Configuration (in A/Gb mode and GERAN Iu
mode)

There are two types of MT:

\- MT0 includes functions belonging to the functional group MT, with
support of no terminal interfaces.

\- MT2 includes functions belonging to the functional group MT, and with
an interface that complies with the 3GPP TS 27.00z series Terminal
Adaptation Function specifications \[33\], \[34\], \[35\]. Accordingly,
the interchange circuit mapping at the MT2 to TE interface shall comply
with the ITU-T V.24 \[42\] recommendation; while the physical
implementation shall conform either to the ITU-T V.28 \[43\], or to the
IrDA IrPHY Physical signalling standard specification \[44\], or to the
PCMCIA 2.1 \[45\], or to the PC-Card 3.0 \[45\], electrical
specification or to later revisions.

The MT plus any TE constitutes the Mobile Station, MS.

The terminal equipment functional groups TE2 and TA are conceptually the
same functional groups as those in the ISDN.

The reference configuration for PLMN (Iu mode) access interfaces is
shown in figure 2.

![](media/image4.png){width="0.3854166666666667in"
height="0.23958333333333334in"}: reference point.

TA: Terminal Adaptor.

MT: Mobile Termination.

ME: Mobile Equipment.

UE: User Equipment

UTRAN: UMTS Radio Access Network.

E-UTRAN: Evolved UMTS Radio Access Network.

CN: Core Network.

5G-AN: 5G Access Network.

Figure 2: PLMN Access Reference Configuration (UTRAN Iu mode, E-UTRAN,
or 5G-RAN)

There is no reference point identified for the TA Function. The TA
Function is considered as a part of the Mobile Termination and with an
interface that complies with the 3GPP TS 27.00z series Terminal
Adaptation Function specifications \[33\], \[34\], \[35\].

3.1 Mobile Termination (MT)
---------------------------

The MT performs the following functions, which performs the following
functions:

\- radio transmission termination;

\- radio transmission channel management;

\- terminal capabilities, including presentation of a man-machine
interface to a user;

\- speech encoding/decoding;

\- error protection for all information sent across the radio path. This
includes FEC (forward error correction) and, for signalling and user
data (except for transparent data services), ARQ (automatic request for
retransmission);

\- flow control of signalling and mapping of user signalling to/from
PLMN access signalling;

\- flow control of user data (except for transparent data services) and
mapping of flow control for asynchronous transparent data services;

\- rate adaptation of user data (see 3GPP TS 44.021\[14\]) and data
formatting for the transmission SAP (3GPP TS 25.322 \[41\]);

\- multiple terminal support;

\- mobility management.

4 Physical Realisation
======================

In a PLMN, the reference point Um/Uu is an interface point, i.e. it is
always implemented as a physical interface (according to 3GPP Technical
Specifications in the 44, 45, 24, 25 and 36 series). The R reference
point may be optionally implemented as physical interface. The
implementation of interfaces at this reference point is according to
3GPP TS 27.001 \[33\], 3GPP TS 27.002 \[34\] and 3GPP TS 27.003 \[35\].

Figure 3 gives examples of configurations illustrating combinations of
physical interfaces at the R reference point. The examples shown are not
exhaustive, but only serve to illustrate possible implementations of the
respective functional blocks.

Example (a) of figure 3 illustrates a fully integrated MS including data
terminal functions within the mobile station equipment.

Example (c) of figure 3 illustrates the connection of a TE2 by an ITU-T
V series interface according to 3GPP TS 27.002 \[34\] and
3GPP TS 27.003 \[35\].

Example (d) of figure 3 illustrates the connection of a MT2 PCMCIA card
to a TE2 by a PCMCIA 2.1 interface according to 3GPP TS 27.002 \[34\]and
3GPP TS 27.003 \[35\].

Example (f) of figure 3 illustrates the connection of a speech only MS.
