4 CONFerence (CONF)
===================

4.1 Introduction
----------------

The **CONFerence (CONF)** service enables a user to participate in and
control a simultaneous communication involving a number of users.

4.2 Description
---------------

### 4.2.1 General description

When the CONF service is invoked, conference resources are allocated to
the served user.

Once a conference is active, users can join and leave a conference, and
remote users can be added to or removed from the conference.

Conference participants can request to be informed of these actions.

The Management Object as defined in 3GPP TS 24.166 \[14\] provides a
mechanism for the UE to discover the Conference Factory URI to be used
for the CONF service. If the UE is not configured with the Conference
Factory URI within the Management Object then the UE shall derive a
Conference Factory URI for MMTEL as described in subclause 13.10 of
3GPP TS 23.003 \[15\] to be used for the CONF service.

NOTE: Depending on the network operator, various mechanisms can be
applied to discover the Conference Factory URI (e.g., include the
Conference Factory URI in a letter written to the user or publish it on
a website). A derived Conference Factory URI might not be a valid URI.

4.3 Operational requirements
----------------------------

### 4.3.1 Provision/withdrawal

The CONF service shall be provided after prior arrangement with the
service provider.

### 4.3.2 Requirements on the originating network side

No specific requirements are needed in the network.

### 4.3.3 Requirements in the network

No specific requirements are needed in the network.

### 4.3.4 Requirements on the terminating network side

No specific requirements are needed in the network.

4.4 Coding requirements
-----------------------

For coding requirements see 3GPP TS 24.147 \[7\], clause 5.

4.5 Signalling requirements
---------------------------

### 4.5.1 Activation/deactivation

The CONF service is activated at provisioning and deactivated at
withdrawal.

### 4.5.1a Registration/erasure

The CONF service requires no registration. Erasure is not applicable.

### 4.5.1b Interrogation

Interrogation of CONF is not applicable.

### 4.5.2 Invocation and operation

This subclause describes the usage of and the changes to the procedures
of 3GPP TS 24.147 \[7\] for invoking and operating a conference.

#### 4.5.2.1 Actions at the originating UE

##### 4.5.2.1.1 User joining a conference

Procedures according to 3GPP TS 24.147 \[7\], subclause 5.3.1.4 shall
apply.

##### 4.5.2.1.2 User inviting another user to a conference

Procedures according to 3GPP TS 24.147 \[7\], subclause 5.3.1.5 shall
apply with the following additions to subclause 5.3.1.5.3 of
3GPP TS 24.147 \[7\]:

\- A UE that has initiated an emergency call, shall not perform any
procedures to add the remote user in that call to a conference.

\- In order to avoid the establishment of a second communication to the
invited user, in case of an active session the UE may additionally
include the Replaces header in the header portion of the SIP URI of the
Refer-to header of the REFER request. The included Replaces header shall
refer to the active dialog that is replaced by the ad-hoc conference.
The Replaces header shall comply with RFC 3891 \[8\].

NOTE 1: In case of an interworking to the PSTN the routing of the INVITE
request from the conference focus to the MGCF that handles the Replaces
information is not deterministic and the replacement of the active
dialog might fail.

EXAMPLE: Refer-To: \<sip:mgcf1.home1.net;
method=INVITE?Replaces=cb03a0s09a2sdfglkj490333%3Bto-tag%3D
314159%3Bfrom-tag%3D171828&Requrie=replaces \>.

NOTE 2: If a conference participant invites another user to a conference
by using a REFER request targeted at the other user (following
3GPP TS 24.147 \[7\] , subclause 5.3.1.5.2), there can be cases where
such REFER request is intercepted by an AS serving the requesting user
which applies special REFER handling procedures according to
3GPP TS 24.628 \[11\] subclause 4.7.2.9.7.2. The consequence of this is
that the conference focus AS will receive an INVITE from the referrers
AS and not from the targeted user. This however does not affect the
conference focus procedures in any way.

##### 4.5.2.1.3 User leaving a conference

Procedures according to 3GPP TS 24.147 \[7\], subclause 5.3.1.6 shall
apply.

##### 4.5.2.1.4 User creating a conference

Procedures according to 3GPP TS 24.147 \[7\], subclause 5.3.1.3 shall
apply.

##### 4.5.2.1.5 Subscription for the conference event package

Procedures according to 3GPP TS 24.147 \[7\], subclause 5.3.1.2 shall
apply.

#### 4.5.2.2 Actions at the conferencing AS

##### 4.5.2.2.1 Conference focus

Procedures according to 3GPP TS 24.147 \[7\] , subclauses 5.3.2 and
6.3.2 shall apply with the following additions to subclause 5.3.2.5.2 of
3GPP TS 24.147 \[7\]:

\- If a Referred-By header is available in the REFER request, the AS
shall verify if the provided Referred-By header contains a valid
identity of the requesting user. If not, the AS shall replace the
Referred-By header with a valid value matching the P-Asserted-Identity
header in the REFER request.

If no Referred-By header is available in the request, the AS shall add a
Referred-By header that matches the P-Asserted-Identity header in the
REFER request.

The procedures described in subclause 5.3.2.5.5 of 3GPP TS 24.147 \[7\]
shall not apply.

##### 4.5.2.2.1A Void

##### 4.5.2.2.2 Conference notification service

In case of the subscription of a conference participant to the
conference notification service, procedures according to
3GPP TS 24.147 \[7\], subclause 5.3.3 shall apply.

#### 4.5.2.2A Procedures at the AS serving the originating user

Upon receiving a REFER request in an existing dialog or outside of an
existing dialog containing a Target-Dialog header field identifying an
existing dialog, from a user involved also in a conference, the AS
serving the originating user shall first check that the REFER request is
valid:

\- the Request-URI in the REFER request is targeted to the same UE
instance (remote UE) that is involved in the dialog; and

\- the Refer-To header in the REFER request contains an URI so that the
method constructed from the URI is equal to an INVITE request to the
Conference focus.

Otherwise, the AS may, depending on operator policy:

\- reject the REFER request; or

\- handle the REFER request with another service; or

\- proxy the REFER request on.

If any of the following is true:

\- the dialog on which the REFER request is received or the dialog which
is identified by the Target-Dialog header field in the REFER request,
was that established by an initial INVITE request that was identified as
a PSAP callback request; or

\- the Refer-To header field in the REFER request contains a URI with
which the referor is involved in a dialog where the initial INVITE
request was identified as a PSAP callback request.

the AS shall based on local policy on how to handle PSAP callbacks
reject the REFER request.

The mechanism to identify an INVITE request as a PSAP callback depends
on local policy and can be based on the PSAP callback indicator
specified in IETF RFC 7090 \[13\].

If the AS determines that the REFER request shall not be sent to the
remote UE and the AS decides to apply 3pcc the AS shall follow the
special REFER handling procedures in 3GPP TS 24.628 \[11\] with the
following addition:

\- the AS shall include the \"isfocus\" header field parameter in the
Contact header field in the INVITE request sent towards the remote UE.

#### 4.5.2.3 Void

#### 4.5.2.4 Void

#### 4.5.2.5 Void

#### 4.5.2.6 Void

#### 4.5.2.7 Actions at the destination UE

Upon receipt of an INVITE request that includes a Replaces header, the
UE shall apply the procedures described in RFC 3891 \[8\] to the INVITE
request.

#### 4.5.2.8 Void

#### 4.5.2.9 Void

4.6 Interaction with other services
-----------------------------------

### 4.6.1 Communication HOLD (HOLD)

The AS supporting the CONF service shall support the procedures for the
held UE as specified in 3GPP TS 24.610 \[12\]

### 4.6.2 Terminating Identification Presentation (TIP)

No impact, i.e. neither service shall affect the operation of the other
service.

### 4.6.3 Terminating Identification Restriction (TIR)

For the conferencing AS implementing the conference focus, the following
applies:

\- If a participant is added to the conference and if TIR is active for
the terminating party of this session, then the identity information of
that participant shall not be included in conference notifications to
other participants.

### 4.6.4 Originating Identification Presentation (OIP)

No impact, i.e. neither service shall affect the operation of the other
service.

### 4.6.5 Originating Identification Restriction (OIR)

For the conferencing AS implementing the conference focus, the following
applies:

\- If a participant joins the conference and if OIR is active for the
originating party of this session, then the identity information of that
participant shall not be included in conference notifications to other
participants.

\- If a REFER request is received and if the Privacy header field is set
to \"header\" or \"user\", then for the INVITE request to the refer-to
target, the conference AS shall:

a\) not insert the Referred-by header field, if it does not exist in the
REFER request; or

b\) remove the Referred-By header field, if the Privacy header field of
the REFER request is set to \"user\".

\- If an INVITE request with \"recipient-list\" body is received, and if
the Privacy header field is set to \"user\", then the conference AS
shall anonymize the From header field of resulting reINVITE request, if
there is established dialog between the conference controller and the
target of the reINVITE request.

### 4.6.6 CONFerence calling (CONF)

Not applicable.

NOTE: Cascading conference services are out of scope of the present
specification.

### 4.6.7 Communication DIVersion services (CDIV)

No impact, i.e. neither service shall affect the operation of the other
service.

### 4.6.8 Malicious Communication IDentification (MCID)

No impact, i.e. neither service shall affect the operation of the other
service.

### 4.6.9 Anonymous Communication Rejection and Communication Barring (ACR/CB)

The focus AS shall not accept REFER requests with a refer-to target that
is barred by the conference creators Outgoing Communication Barring
(OCB) rules.

The focus AS shall remove the URI that is barred by the conference
creator Outgoing Communication Barring (OCB) rules from the list of URIs
in the \"recipient-list\" body of INVITE request.

### 4.6.10 Explicit Communication Transfer (ECT)

No impact, i.e. neither service shall affect the operation of the other
service.

### 4.6.11 Multi-Device (MuD)

No impact.

### 4.6.12 Multi-Identity (MiD)

No impact.

4.7 Interworking with other networks

######## Annex A (informative): Signalling flows

A.0 Scope of signalling flows
=============================

This annex gives examples of signalling flows related to the Conference
(CONF) service.

These signalling flows are simplified in that they do not show the AS to
MRFC interactions nor the AS and MRFC functional split.

A.1 CONF interworking signalling flow in case of an active communication between IMS and PSTN
=============================================================================================

Figure A.1 depictures a flow where two UEs are engaged in a call, and
one of the users is located in the PSTN. At some point in time, UE A
decides to activate the CONF service and move the call to a centralized
conference. UE A creates the conference, and provides instructions to
the conference server to contact UE B and replace the initial
communication with a communication to the conference server.

Figure A.1: CONF interworking signalling flow in case of an active
communication\
between IMS and PSTN

\- Description figure A.1

NOTE: Only the most relevant messages are shown in figure A.1

UE-A is in an active voice session with a PSTN/ISDN TE (SIP dialog with
Call-ID, to-tag and from-tag between UE-A and MGCF). It then creates a
conference and invites the PSTN/ISDN TE to the conference by sending a
REFER to the conference focus, which invites the PSTN/ISDN TE to the
conference by sending an INVITE which includes the Replaces header to
the MGCF. The MGCF confirms the session, switches the existing bearer
channel to the new RTP session, and terminates the session which is
replaced.

1\. to 3. UE-A initiates a voice session with a PSTN/ISDN TE by sending
an INVITE request to the MGCF.

A.2 Call flow for 3PTY CONF
===========================

A.2.1 Invite other user to 3PTY CONF by sending REFER request
-------------------------------------------------------------

Figure A.2 depictures a flow where two UEs, UE-1 and UE-2, are engaged
in a call. At some point in time, UE-1 decides to involve UE-3 into the
communication and activate the 3PTY CONF service. UE-1 puts UE-2 on
hold, initiates a session toward UE-3 to get the user\'s permission to
start 3PTY call, creates the conference, and moves the original
communication with both UE-2 and UE-3 to the conference server.

![](media/image4.png){width="6.252777777777778in" height="9.1125in"}

Figure A.2: Call flow for 3PTY conference

UE-1 and UE-2 are in an active call. UE-1 decides to add UE-3 to make it
a 3-way conferencing call.

1\. UE-1 and UE-2 are in an active call.

2\. UE-1 puts UE-2 on hold before invoking the 3-Way Calling with UE-3.

3\~11. UE-1 establishes a call with UE-3 following normal call setup
procedure and gets UE-3\'s permission to start the 3-Way Calling.

12\~14. UE-1 sends an INVITE request to the conference server to
establish a conference session.

15\. The CS coordinates with MRFP to allocate conference resources.

16\~21. The CS sends a 200 (OK) response and receives an ACK request
from UE-1.

22\~27. UE-1 sends a REFER request to UE-2 with the Refer-To header set
to the address of the CS; UE-2 accepts the REFER request.

28\~33. UE-2 sends a NOTIFY request to UE-1 to indicate that UE-2 is
acting on the REFER request.

34\~35. UE-2 sends an INVITE request to the CS to join the conference.

36\. The CS coordinates with MRFP to allocate more resources.

37\~40. The CS sends a 200 (OK) response to UE-2 and receives an ACK
request.

41\~46. UE-2 sends a NOTIFY request to UE-1 to indicate that it has
finished action required by the REFER request.

47\~52. UE-1 sends a BYE request to terminate the call between itself
and UE-2.

53\~58. In parallel to step 22\~52, UE-1 sends a REFER request to UE-3
with the Refer-To header set to the address of the CS; UE-3 accepts the
REFER request.

59\~64. UE-3 sends a NOTIFY request to UE-1 to indicate that UE-3 is
acting on the REFER request.

65\~66. UE-3 sends an INVITE request to the CS to join the conference.

67\. The CS coordinates with MRFP to allocate more resources.

68\~71. The CS sends a 200 (OK) response to UE-3 and receives an ACK
request.

72\~77. UE-3 sends a NOTIFY request to UE-1 to indicate that it has
finished action required by the REFER request.

78\~83. UE-1 sends a BYE request to terminate the call between itself
and UE-3.

A.2.2 Invite other user to 3PTY CONF by sending INVITE request with URI list
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Figure A.3 depictures a flow where UA-A is involved in 2 communications
with UA-B and UA-C, both 2 communications are on-hold. The AS is
involved in both 2 communications as a B2BUA.

When user A intends to start the 3PTY conference, UA-A sends an INVITE
request to the AS to create the conference and indicates that certain
dialogs will be re-used for this conference, The AS sends re-INVITEs in
the indicated dialogs and connects the media to the conference bridge.
The dialogs can be indicated by adding the Call-ID header field, the
From header field and the To header field to the entries in the URI list
of the initial INVITE request.

Figure A.3: Call flow for 3PTY conference

1: Both dialogs are in the held condition. This assumes that the AS has
the correct interactions between the services call HOLD and CONF i.e.
when the conference is finished the origin dialogs 1c and 2c with
Session-ID 1 and Session-ID 2 will be resumed. This is needed to allow
resuming the held dialogs.

2: UA-A creates a conference and invites user B and user C to the
conference by sending an INVITE request to the Conference Factory URI
and including URI list in the INVITE request, UA-A indicates the dialogs
which be re-used for this conference in the uri list by the mechanism
described in 3GPP TS 24.147 \[7\].

INVITE CONF AS

\</list\>

\</resource-lists\>

2: AS verifies if the dialogs in URI list matches to a partial dialog
which AS already involved, In the case of a match the AS use this dialog
ID information to send re-INVITE request to UA-B and UA-C in the partial
dialogs between the AS and the invited users in order to connect the
media of the invited users to the MRFP.

3: After the establishment of the conference a couple of possibilities
exist:

\- Release the two held and the active dialogs.

\- Release the active dialog between UA-A and the AS and resume one of
the held dialogs to active. And let the other dialog either to user B or
C in status HOLD.

\- Release one of the connections either to user B or user C. Which
includes the release of the UA-A to AS dialog and resume the held
connection.

NOTE: There are different behaviours between mobile and fixed access
devices. While mobile devices are not able to provide more than two
dialogs (e.g. one held one active) while the fixed line access has no
restrictions. TISPAN defined in ETSI TS 183 043 \[10\] the IMS-based
PSTN/ISDN emulation where a couple of examples are given.

An example of an IFC Trigger Point configuration where the S-CSCF does
not invoke the MMTel AS for a PSAP callback:

\- Method=\"INVITE\" and not Priority header field with a
