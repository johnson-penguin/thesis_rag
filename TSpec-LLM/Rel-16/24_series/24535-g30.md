TSG modify the contents of the present document, it will be re-released
by the TSG with an identifying change of release date and an increase in
version number as follows:

Version x.y.z

where:

x the first digit:

1 presented to TSG for information;

2 presented to TSG for approval;

3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.

**might** indicates a likelihood that something will happen as a result
of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document

result of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside
the scope of the present document

In addition:

**is** (or any other verb in the indicative mood) indicates a statement
of fact

**is not** (or any other negative verb in the indicative mood) indicates
a statement of fact

NOTE 5: The constructions \"is\" and \"is not\" do not indicate
requirements.

4 General
=========

For time sensitive communication (TSC), a 5G system (5GS) can be
integrated as a bridge in a time-sensitive networking (TSN) network
(i.e. a TSN bridge). The device-side TSN translator (DS-TT) is deployed
at the UE-side edge and the network-side TSN translator (NW-TT) is
deployed at the network-side edge in order to interface with a TSN
network while achieving transparency (see 3GPP TS 23.501 \[2\]).

The DS-TT and NW-TT fulfil all functions related to IEEE 802.1AS \[4\],
which include delivery of generalized precision time protocol (gPTP)
messages. Clause 5 describes details of the gPTP message delivery.

5 gPTP message delivery
=======================

5.1 Overview
------------

For TSN time synchronization, a 5G system (5GS) can be considered as a
time-aware system, which needs to support implementation of generalized
precision time protocol (gPTP) requirements (see IEEE 802.1AS \[4\]).

Within a 5GS, a gPTP message is delivered over the user plane. While the
generic mechanisms for the gPTP message delivery are according to
IEEE Std 802.1AS \[4\], a specific requirement for the DS-TT and the
NW-TT is available in terms of the signalling of ingress time. See
clause 5.2 for further details.

5.2 Signalling of ingress time for time synchronization
-------------------------------------------------------

Upon reception of a downlink gPTP message (Sync message for one-step
operation or Follow\_Up message for two-step operation) for a given TSN
working domain, the NW-TT shall create an ingress timestamping (TSi) for
each gPTP event (Sync) message and add Suffix field with TSi to the gPTP
message encoded as specified in clause 5.3.1.

Upon reception of a gPTP message over the user plane, the UE shall
forward the gPTP message to the DS-TT. The DS-TT shall create an egress
timestamping (TSe) for every gPTP event (Sync) message. The DS-TT shall
use TSi from the Suffix field of the gPTP message (Sync message for
one-step operation or Follow\_Up message for two-step operation) to
calculate the residence time spent within the 5G system for the gPTP
event (Sync) message expressed in 5GS time as specified in
3GPP TS 23.501 \[2\] for the corresponding TSN working domain, then
shall remove the Suffix field that contains TSi from the gPTP message
before sending the gPTP message toward the downstream TSN node.

In case of multiple TSN working domains, the procedure above is repeated
for each TSN working domain sending its own gPTP messages.

In case of a gPTP message (Sync message for one-step operation or
Follow\_Up message for two-step operation) locally generated by the
NW-TT (i.e. synchronization is provided by the 5G clock), the NW-TT
makes the time generating the gPTP event (Sync) message as TSi and add
Suffix field with TSi to the gPTP message encoded as specified in
clause 5.3.1.

5.3 Encoding of organization specific TLV extensions
----------------------------------------------------

### 5.3.1 General

Organization specific TLV extensions are included the Suffix field of a
gPTP message as specified in clause 14.3 of IEEE Std 1588-2008 \[3\].
The Suffix field is coded as shown in figure 5.3.1.1 and table 5.3.1.1.
