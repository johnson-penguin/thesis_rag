Foreword
========

This Technical Specification has been produced by the 3rd Generation
Partnership Project (3GPP).

The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work
within the TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the
TSG modify the contents of the present document, it will be re-released
by the TSG with an identifying change of release date and an increase in
version number as follows:

Version x.y.z

where:

x the first digit:

1 presented to TSG for information;

2 presented to TSG for approval;

3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.

y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e.
technical enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.

z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been
incorporated in the document.

1 Scope
=======

The present document defines a Management Object (MO) for Originating
Identification Presentation (OIP) and Originating Identification
Restriction (OIR). The management object is compatible with OMA Device
Management protocol specifications, version 1.2 and upwards, and is
defined using the OMA DM Device Description Framework as described in
the Enabler Release Definition OMA-ERELD \_DM-V1\_2 \[2\].

The OIP/OIR MO consists of relevant parameters that can be managed for
the UE configuration related to the Originating Identification
Presentation (OIP) and Originating Identification Restriction (OIR)
service defined in 3GPP TS 24.607 \[3\].

2 References
============

The following documents contain provisions which, through reference in
this text, constitute provisions of the present document.

\- References are either specific (identified by date of publication,
edition number, version number, etc.) or non‑specific.

\- For a specific reference, subsequent revisions do not apply.

\- For a non-specific reference, the latest version applies. In the case
of a reference to a 3GPP document (including a GSM document), a
non-specific reference implicitly refers to the latest version of that
document *in the same Release as the present document*.

4 OIP and OIR management object
===============================

4.1 General
-----------

The OIP-OIR Management Object (MO) is used to configure the UE behaviour
for the settings related to Originating Identification Presentation
(OIP) and Originating Identification Restriction (OIR) supplementary
services.

The MO Identifier (MOID) is: urn:oma:mo:ext-3gpp-oipoir:1.0.

Protocol compatibility: This MO is compatible with OMA DM 1.2.The
following nodes and leaf objects are possible under the Name node as
described in figure 4-1:

5 Management object parameters
==============================

5.1 General
-----------

This clause describes the parameters for the Originating Identification
Presentation (OIP) and Originating Identification Restriction (OIR) MO.

5.2 Node: /\<X\>
----------------

This interior node acts as a placeholder for the OIP and OIR services
MO.

For the OIP-OIR services configuration MO, the namespace specific string
is: \"urn:oma:mo:ext-3gpp-oipoir:1.0\"

\- Occurrence: OneOrMore

\- Format: node

\- Access Types: Get, Replace

\- Values: N/A

Support for a UE is defined by the UE role as specified in
3GPP TS 24.607 \[3\].

NOTE: One node is normally used.

5.3 /*\<X\>*/Name
-----------------

The Name leaf is a name for the OIP and OIR services settings.

\- Occurrence: ZeroOrOne

\- Format: chr

\- Access Types: Get, Replace

\- Values: \<User displayable name\>

5.4 /*\<X\>*/FromPreferred
--------------------------

The FromPreferred leaf indicates operator\'s originating party identity
determination policy.

\- Occurrence: One

\- Format: bool

\- Access Types: Get, Replace

\- Values: 0, 1

0 -- Indicates that the From header field is not used for determination
of the originating party identity in OIP service.

1 -- Indicates that the identity provided within the From header field
is used for determination of the originating party identity in OIP
service, regardless the presence or absence of the P-Asserted-Identity
header field.

The default value is \'0\'.

Use of the FromPreferred leaf is specified in 3GPP TS 24.607 \[3\].

5.5 /\<x\>/Ext/
---------------

The Ext is an interior node for where the vendor specific information
about the OIP and OIR services UE configuration MO is being placed.
Usually the vendor extension is identified by vendor specific name under
the ext node and contains the vendor meaning application vendor, device
vendor etc. The tree structure under the vendor identified is not
defined and can therefore include one or more un-standardized sub-trees.

\- Occurrence: ZeroOrOne

\- Format: node

\- Access Types: Get

\- Values: N/A

######## Annex A (informative): Management object DDF

This DDF is the standardized minimal set. A vendor can define its own
DDF for the complete device. This DDF can include more features than
this minimal standardized version.
