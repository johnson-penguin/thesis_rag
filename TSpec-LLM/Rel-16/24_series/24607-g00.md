4 Originating Identification Presentation (OIP) and Originating Identification Restriction (OIR)
================================================================================================

4.1 Introduction
----------------

The **Originating Identification Presentation (OIP)** service provides
the terminating user with the possibility of receiving identity
information in order to identify the originating user.

The **Originating Identification Restriction (OIR)** service enables the
originating user to prevent presentation of its identity information to
the terminating user.

4.2 Description
---------------

### 4.2.1 General description

The OIP service provides the terminating user with the possibility of
receiving trusted (i.e. network‑provided) identity information in order
to identify the originating user.

In addition to the trusted identity information, the identity
information from the originating user can include identity information
generated by the originating user and in general transparently
transported by the network. In the particular case where the \"no
screening\" special arrangement does not apply, the originating network
shall verify the content of this user generated identity information.
The terminating network cannot be responsible for the content of this
user generated identity information.

The OIR service is a service offered to the originating user. It
restricts presentation of the originating user\'s identity information
to the terminating user.

When the OIR service is applicable and activated, the originating
network provides the destination network with the indication that the
originating user\'s identity information is not allowed to be presented
to the terminating user. In this case, no originating user\'s identity
information shall be included in the requests sent to the terminating
user. The presentation restriction function shall not influence the
forwarding of the originating user\'s identity information within the
network as part of the supplementary service procedures.

4.3 Operational requirements
----------------------------

### 4.3.1 Provision/withdrawal

#### 4.3.1.1 OIP Provision/withdrawal

The OIP service may be provided after prior arrangement with the service
provider or be generally available.

The OIP service shall be withdrawn at the subscriber\'s request or for
administrative reasons.

As a general operator policy a special arrangement may exist on a per
subscriber basis or on a general behaviour basis whereby the originating
user\'s identity information intended to be transparently transported by
the network is not screened by the network.

#### 4.3.1.2 OIR Provision/withdrawal

The OIR service, temporary mode, may be provided on a subscription basis
or may be generally available.

The OIR service, permanent mode, shall be provided on a subscription
basis.

As a network option, the OIR service can be offered with several
subscription options. A network providing the OIR service shall support
temporary mode at a minimum. Subscription options are summarized in
table 1.

Table 1: OIR Subscription options

+----------------------------+----------------------------------------+
| Subscription option values | Values                                 |

|                            |                                        |
|                            | ‑ restrict all private information     |
|                            | appearing in headers                   |
+----------------------------+----------------------------------------+

### 4.3.2 Requirements on the originating network side

As part of the basic communication procedures specified in
3GPP TS 24.229 \[3\], the following requirements apply at the
originating network side in support of the OIP service and the OIR
service. Unless noted otherwise, these requirements are meant to apply
to all requests meant to initiate either a dialog or a standalone
transaction. These procedures apply regardless of whether the
originating or terminating parties subscribe to the OIP service or the
OIR service:

1 The originating UE can insert two forms of identity information that
correspond to the following two purposes:

As a suggestion to the network as to what public user identity the
network should be included in the request as network asserted identity
information.

As a UE‑provided identity to be transparently transported by the
network.

2 In the case where no identity information is provided by the
originating UE for the purpose of suggesting a network‑provided
identity, the network shall include identity information based on the
default public user identity associated with the originating UE.

3 In the case where identity information is provided by the originating
UE for the purpose of suggesting a network-provided identity, the
network shall attempt to match the information provided with the set of
registered public identities of the originating UE. If a match is found,
the network shall include an identity based on the information provided
by the originating UE.

As a network option, if the \"no screening\" special arrangement does
not exist with the originating UE, the network may attempt to match the
UE‑provided identity information with the set of registered public
identities of the originating user. If a match is not found, the network
shall replace the UE‑provided identity with one that includes the
default public user identity.

The UE can include an indication that it wishes to have the presentation
of its identity information to be restricted. The following cases exist:

\- If the originating user has subscribed to the OIR service in the
permanent mode, then the network shall invoke the OIR service for each
outgoing request.

\- If the originating user has subscribed to the OIR service in the
temporary mode with default value \"presentation restricted\", then the
network shall invoke the OIR service for each outgoing request unless
the default value is overridden by subscriber request at the time of
outgoing request.

\- If the originating user has subscribed to the OIR service in the
temporary mode with default value \"presentation not restricted\", then
the network shall only invoke the OIR service if requested by the
subscriber at the time of outgoing initial request.

\- If the originating user has not subscribed to the OIR service but the
originating UE sends a SIP request initiating a dialog or standalone
transaction with Privacy header fields indicating a privacy request or a
digit sequence within the Request-URI that comprise the effective dial
string for restricting the presentation of identity information then,
the SIP request may be rejected by operator policy.

NOTE 1AA: Only when supporting the MMTEL for the OIP/OIR Service such a
procedure is possible. This requires an initial filter criterion to be
setup for the user who is not subscribed to the OIR service.

\- If the OIR service is not invoked, the network‑provided identity
shall be considered to be presentation allowed.

NOTE 1A: For the network to invoke the service, the S-CSCF will forward
an initial request towards the AS that hosts the OIR service. This
requires an initial filter criterion to be setup for the user who is
subscribed to the service. Annex B provides an example of an initial
filter criterion that can be applied for the OIR service.

As an originating network option, if the originating user invokes the
OIR service for a particular request, the originating network may
prevent any UE‑provided identification information (in addition to the
trusted identity information) from being displayed to the terminating
user.

NOTE 1: As an informative description, for OIP/OIR this means the
following procedures are expected to be provided by the P‑CSCF
regardless of whether the originating user does or does not subscribe to
the OIP service or OIR service. When the P‑CSCF receives an initial
request for a dialog or a request for a standalone transaction, and the
request contains a P‑Preferred‑Identity header field that matches one of
the registered public user identities, the P‑CSCF is expected to
identify the initiator of the request by that public user identity. In
particular, the P‑CSCF is expected to include a P‑Asserted‑Identity
header field set to that public user identity. When the P‑CSCF receives
an initial request for a dialog or a request for a standalone
transaction, and the request contains as P‑Preferred‑Identity header
field that does not match one of the registered public user identities,
or does not contain a P‑Preferred‑Identity header field, the P‑CSCF is
expected to identify the initiator of the request by a default public
user identity. In particular, the P‑CSCF is expected to include a
P‑Asserted‑Identity header field set to the default public user
identity. If there is more then one default public user identity
available, the P‑CSCF is expected to randomly select one of them.

NOTE 2: In the case where the S‑CSCF has knowledge of an associated
tel‑URI for a SIP URI contained in the P‑Asserted‑Identity header field
received in the request, the S‑CSCF adds a second P‑Asserted‑Identity
header field containing this tel‑URI.

NOTE 3: For the S‑CSCF to forward an initial request towards the AS that
hosts the OIR service, an initial filter criterion is to be setup for
the user who is subscribed to the service. Annex B provides an example
of an initial filter criterion that that can be applied for the OIR
service.

NOTE 4: It is assumed that the IBCF is responsible for stripping the
P‑Asserted‑Identity from the SIP header when interworking with untrusted
networks.

### 4.3.3 Requirements on the terminating network side

For terminating users that subscribe to the OIP service, and if network
provided identity information about the originator is available, and if
presentation is allowed, the network shall include that information in
the requests sent to the UE.

If the presentation of the public user identity is restricted, then the
terminating UE shall receive an indication that the public user identity
was not sent because of restriction.

If the public user identity is not available at the terminating network
(for reasons such as interworking), then the network shall indicate to
the terminating user that the public user identity was not included for
reasons other than that the originating user invoked the OIR service.

For terminating users that do not subscribe to the OIP service, the
network shall not send the network provided identity information about
the originator in the requests sent to the UE, even if that information
is available, and if presentation is allowed. Additionally, the network
may prevent the transmission of any UE‑provided identity information.

NOTE 1: The priv-value \"id\" in the Privacy header is not expected be
removed when removing any P-Asserted-Identity header as described in
3GPP TS 24.229 \[3\] subclauses 4.4.2 and 5.4.3.3.

NOTE 2: When removing the P‑Asserted‑identity any following service in
the chain could be affected. Therefore service based on the originating
identity (such as ICB and ACR), are expected to precede the OIP service
in the chain.

NOTE 3: It is assumed that the IBCF is responsible for stripping the
P‑Asserted‑Identity from the SIP header when interworking with untrusted
networks.

4.4 Syntax requirements
-----------------------

The syntax for the relevant header fields in the SIP requests are
normatively described in 3GPP TS 24.229 \[3\]. The relevant headers are:

\- The P‑Preferred‑Identity header field, which shall conform to the
specifications in IETF RFC 3325 \[7\] and IETF RFC 3966 \[9\].

\- The P‑Asserted‑Identity header field, which shall conform to the
specifications in IETF RFC 3325 \[7\] and IETF RFC 3966 \[9\].

\- The Privacy header field, which shall conform to the specifications
in IETF RFC 3323 \[6\] and IETF RFC 3325 \[7\].

NOTE: The privacy level \"session\" and \"critical\" are not used in
this specification.

\- The From header field, which shall conform to the specifications in
IETF RFC 3261 \[10\] and IETF RFC 3966 \[9\].

4.5 Signalling procedures 
-------------------------

### 4.5.0 General

Configuration of supplementary services by the user should:

\- take place over the Ut interface using XCAP as enabling protocol as
described in 3GPP TS 24.623 \[13\]; or

\- use SIP based user configuration as described in
3GPP TS 24.238 \[15\];

NOTE: Other possibilities for user configuration, such as web-based
provisioning or pre-provisioning by the operator are outside the scope
of the present document, but are not precluded.

The enhancements to the XML schema for use over the Ut interface are
described in subclause 4.10.

### 4.5.1 Activation/deactivation

The OIP service is activated at provisioning and deactivated at
withdrawal.

The OIR service is activated at provisioning and deactivated at
withdrawal.

### 4.5.1A Registration/erasure

The OIP service requires no registration. Erasure is not applicable.

The OIR service requires no registration. Erasure is not applicable.

### 4.5.1B Interrogation

For interrogation of OIP and OIR, the mechanisms specified in
subclause 4.5.0 should be used.

### 4.5.2 Invocation and operation

#### 4.5.2.1 Actions at the originating UE

As part of basic communication, the originating UE may insert a
P‑Preferred‑Identity header field in any initial SIP request for a
dialog or in any SIP request for a standalone transaction as a hint for
creation of a public user identity as described in 3GPP TS 24.229 \[3\].

NOTE 1: According 3GPP TS 24.229 \[3\], the UE can include any of the
following in the P‑Preferred‑Identity header field:

a public user identity which has been registered by the user;

a public user identity returned in a registration‑state event package of
a NOTIFY request as a result of an implicit registration that was not
subsequently deregistered or has expired; or

any other public user identity which the user has assumed by mechanisms
outside the scope of 3GPP TS 24.229 \[3\] to have a current
registration.

If the originating user wishes to override the default setting of
\"presentation not restricted\" of the OIR service in temporary mode:

\- The originating UE shall include an \"anonymous\" From header field.
The convention for configuring an anonymous From header field described
in IETF RFC 3323 \[6\] should be followed; i.e. From: \"Anonymous\"
\<sip:anonymous\@anonymous.invalid\>;tag= xxxxxxx.

\- If only the P‑Asserted‑Identity needs to be restricted the
originating UE shall include a Privacy header field \[6\] set to \"id\"
in accordance with IETF RFC 3325 \[7\].

\- If all headers containing private information that the UE cannot
anonymize itself need to be restricted, the originating UE shall include
a Privacy header field set to \"header\" in accordance with
IETF RFC 3323 \[6\].

NOTE 2: The Privacy header field value \"header\" does not apply to the
identity in the From header field.

If the originating user wishes to override the default setting of
\"presentation restricted\" of the OIR service in temporary mode:

\- The originating UE shall include a Privacy header field of privacy
type \"none\" in accordance with\
3GPP TS 24.229 \[3\] (IETF RFC 3323 \[6\]).

#### 4.5.2.2 Void

#### 4.5.2.3 Void

#### 4.5.2.4 Actions at the AS serving the originating UE

For an originating user that subscribes to the OIR service in
\"permanent mode\", the AS shall:

1\) insert a Privacy header field set to:

a\) \"id\" if only the P-Asserted-Identity header field needs to be
restricted as described in RFC 3325 \[7\]; or

b\) \"header\" if all the header fields, containing private information
that the UE cannot anonymize need to be restricted as described in
RFC 3323 \[6\]. This choice is based on the subscription option.

NOTE 1: The Privacy header field value \"header\" does not apply to the
identity in the From header field.

2\) If the request includes a Privacy header field that is set to
\"none\", remove the \"none\" value from the Privacy header field; and

3\) based on operator policy, either modify the From header field to
remove the identification information, or add a Privacy header field set
to \"user\".

For an originating user that subscribes to the OIR service in
\"temporary mode\" with default \"presentation-restricted\", if the
request does not include a Privacy header field, or the request includes
a Privacy header field that is not set to \"none\", the AS shall:

1\) insert a Privacy header field set to:

a\) \"id\" if only the P-Asserted-Identity header field needs to be
restricted as described in RFC 3325 \[7\]; or

b\) \"header\" if all the header fields, containing private information
that the UE cannot anonymize need to be restricted as described in
RFC 3323 \[6\]. This choice is based on the subscription option.

NOTE 2: The Privacy header field value \"header\" does not apply to the
identity in the From header field.

2\) based on operator policy, either modify the From header field to
remove the identification information, or add a Privacy header field set
to \"user\".

NOTE 3: When the OIR service is used, the originating UE is supposed to
already have removed identity information from the From header field.
However because this UE is not trusted, this is also done by the AS to
ensure that this information is removed.

For an originating user that subscribes to the OIR service in
\"temporary mode\" with default \"presentation-not-restricted\", if the
request includes a Privacy header field is set to \"id\" or \"header\",
based on operator policy, the AS shall either modify the From header
field to remove the identification information or add a Privacy header
field set to \"user\". As an originating network option, if the \"no
screening\" special arrangement does not exist with the originating
user, the AS may attempt to match the information in the From header
with the set of registered public identities of the originating user. If
a match is not found, the AS may set the From header to the SIP URI that
includes the default public user identity.

For an originating user who has not subscribed to the OIR service but
requests the restriction of its identity information by sending Privacy
header fields requesting privacy as defined in subclause 4.5.2.1, then
the SIP request for initiating a dialog or standalone transaction may be
rejected by operator policy with a 403(Forbidden) response including a
warning header field 399 \"OIR not subscribed\".

NOTE 4: Only when supporting the MMTEL for the OIP/OIR Service such a
procedure is possible. This requires an initial filter criterion to be
setup for the user who is not subscribed to the OIR service.

#### 4.5.2.5 Void

#### 4.5.2.6 Void

#### 4.5.2.7 Void

#### 4.5.2.8 Void

#### 4.5.2.9 Actions at the AS serving the terminating UE

If OIP service of the terminating user is not activated, then the AS
shall remove any P-Asserted-Identity or Privacy header fields included
in the request. Additionally, the Application Server may as a network
option anonymize the contents of the From header field by setting it to
a default non significant value. As a network option, if the terminating
user has an override category, the AS shall send the P-Asserted-Identity
header fields and remove the Privacy header fields.

Based on local policy, if a P-Asserted-Identity header field and a From
header field exist and carry different user identities, the AS may
remove the P-Asserted-Identity header fields. As part of this policy,
this removal can be limited to scenarios where the From header field
fulfils some operator specific prerequisites (e.g. specific national
number ranges).

NOTE 1: This option is used to achieve an identical behaviour for
different access types where just one identity is provided to the UE.

When the Privacy header field is set to \"id\", with the exception of
the cases listed above, the AS should not remove this Privacy header
entry.

NOTE 2: The priv-value \"id\" in the Privacy header will be used by the
terminating UE to distinguish the request of OIR by the originating
user.

If the request includes the Privacy header field set to \"header\" the
AS shall:

a\) anonymize the contents of all header fields containing private
information that are not \"user configurable\" in accordance with
IETF RFC 3323 \[6\];

b\) add a Privacy header field with the priv-value set to \"id\" if not
already present in the request; and

c\) remove the priv-value \"header\" from the Privacy header field in
accordance with IETF RFC 3323 \[6\].

NOTE 3: The Privacy header field value \"header\" does not apply to the
identity in the From header field.

If the request includes the Privacy header field set to \"user\" the AS
shall remove or anonymize the contents of all \"user configurable\"
headers (e.g. the From header field), and remove the priv-value \"user\"
from the Privacy header field in accordance with IETF RFC 3323 \[6\]. In
the latter case, the AS may need to act as transparent back‑to‑back user
agent as described in IETF RFC 3323 \[6\].

#### 4.5.2.10 Void

#### 4.5.2.11 Void

#### 4.5.2.12 Actions at the terminating UE

A terminating UE shall support the receipt of one or more
P-Asserted-Identity header fields in SIP requests initiating a dialog or
standalone transactions.

The UE may support the operator\'s originating party identity
determination policy.

The UE may support being configured with the operator\'s originating
party identity determination policy in the \"FromPreferred\" leaf node
of 3GPP TS 24.417 \[17\].

Editor\'s note \[CR\#0055, IOC\_UE\_conf\]: Handling of any
configuration on UICC related to the operator\'s originating party
identity determination policy is FFS.

If the UE supports the operator\'s originating party identity
determination policy:

1\) if the operator\'s originating party identity determination policy
indicates that the From header field is not used for determination of
the originating party identity in OIP service, the UE shall determine
that the identity(ies) in the P-Asserted-Identity header field(s)
is(are) the originating user identity. If the P-Asserted-Identity header
field is absent and the Privacy header field is set to \"id\", the UE
shall determine the originating party identity is anonymized. If the
P-Asserted-Identity header field is absent and the Privacy header field
is set to \"none\" or absent, the UE shall determine the originating
party identity is unavailable; and

2\) if the operator\'s originating party identity determination policy
indicates that the identity provided within the From header field is
used for determination of the originating party identity in OIP service,
then regardless of the presence or absence of the P-Asserted-Identity
header field, the UE shall determine that the identity in the From
header field is the originating user identity.

NOTE 1: The UE finds the network-asserted identity(ies) of the
originating user in the P-Asserted-Identity header field(s). The UE
finds the additional identity in the From header field.

NOTE 2: If the UE does not support the operator\'s originating party
identity determination policy, it is dependent on the UE implementation
whether the additional identity, the network-asserted identity(ies), all
or none are presented to the user.

NOTE 3: It is not guaranteed that the additional identity is trusted.

NOTE 4: If no P-Asserted-Identity header fields are present, but a
Privacy header field was present, then the one or more network-asserted
identities of the originating user can have been withheld due to
presentation restriction.

NOTE 5: If neither P-Asserted‑Identity header fields nor a Privacy
header field are present, then the network-asserted identities of the
originating user can lack availability (due to, for example,
interworking with other networks), or the user can be without a
subscription to the OIP service.

4.6 Interaction with other services
-----------------------------------

### 4.6.1 Communication Hold (HOLD)

No impact, i.e. neither service shall affect the operation of the other
service.

### 4.6.2 Terminating Identity Presentation (TIP)

No impact, i.e. neither service shall affect the operation of the other
service.

### 4.6.3 Terminating Identity Restriction (TIR)

No impact, i.e. neither service shall affect the operation of the other
service.

### 4.6.4 Originating Identity Presentation (OIP) 

The OIR service shall normally take precedence over the OIP service.

The OIP service can take precedence over the OIR service when the
destination subscriber has an override category. This is a national
matter, and is outside the scope of the present document.

### 4.6.5 Originating Identity Restriction (OIR)

The OIR service shall normally take precedence over the OIP service.

The OIP service can take precedence over the OIR service when the
destination user has an override category. This is a national matter,
and is outside the scope of the present document.

### 4.6.6 Conference calling (CONF)

No impact, i.e. neither service shall affect the operation of the other
service.

### 4.6.7 Communication diversion services (CDIV)

When a request has been diverted and the diverted‑to user has been
provided with the OIP service, the diverted‑to UE shall receive the
identity information of the original originating user. When the OIR
service has been invoked, the originating user\'s identity information
shall not be presented to the diverted‑to user unless the diverted‑to
user has an override category.

### 4.6.8 Malicious Communication IDentification (MCID)

No impact, i.e. neither service shall affect the operation of the other
service.

NOTE: When the MCID service is invoked, the identity of an incoming
communication is registered in the network whether or not the
originating user has activated the OIR service.

### 4.6.9 Incoming Communication Barring (ICB)

Within the network execution of ICB and ACR services shall precede the
OIP service.

### 4.6.10 Explicit Communication Transfer (ECT)

No impact, i.e. neither service shall affect the operation of the other
service.

### 4.6.11 Enhanced Calling Name (eCNAM)

For users that subscribe to both OIP and eCNAM, and subject to service
provider policy, the name information retrieved through eCNAM may
override any name information available via OIP. Enhanced CNAM service
is described in described in 3GPP TS 24.196 \[18\].

Subject to service provider policy, eCNAM metadata and other OIP data
may both be presented to the end user with or without individual marking
to distinguish the eCNAM service data from other call information.

If OIP is not activated, eCNAM data will not be available.

### 4.6.12 Multi-Device (MuD)

No impact. Neither service shall affect the operation of the other
service.

### 4.6.13 Multi-Identity (MiD)

No impact. Neither service shall affect the operation of the other
service.

4.7 Interactions with other networks
------------------------------------

### 4.7.1 Void

### 4.7.2 Void

### 4.7.3 Void

4.8 Signalling flows
--------------------

No OIP or OIR service specific signalling flow is necessary in addition
to the basic communication control according to 3GPP TS 24.229 \[3\].

4.9 Parameter values (timers)
-----------------------------

No specific timers are required.

4.10 Service configuration
--------------------------

### 4.10.0 General

Originating Identity documents are sub‑trees of the *simservs* XML
document specified in 3GPP TS 24.623 \[13\]. As such, Originating
Identity documents use the XCAP application usage in
3GPP TS 24.623 \[13\].

**Data semantics:** The semantics of the Originating Identity XML
configuration document is specified in subclause 4.10.1.

**XML schema:** Implementations in compliance with the present document
shall implement the XML schema that minimally includes the XML Schema
defined in subclause 4.10.2 and the *simservs* XML schema specified in
subclause 6.3 of 3GPP TS 24.623 \[13\].

An instance of an Originating Identity document is shown:

\<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?\>

\<simservs xmlns=\"http://uri.etsi.org/ngn/params/xml/simservs/xcap\"
xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" \>

\<originating-identity-presentation active=\"true\"/\>

\<originating-identity-presentation-restriction active=\"true\"\>

\<default-behaviour\>presentation-restricted\</default-behaviour\>

\</originating-identity-presentation-restriction\>

\</simservs\>

### 4.10.1 Data semantics

The OIP service can be activated/deactivated using the active attribute
of the \<originating‑identity‑presentation\> service element.

The OIR service can be activated/deactivated using the active attribute
of the \<originating‑identity‑presentation‑restriction\> service
element. Activating the OIR service this way activates the temporary
mode OIR service. When deactivated and not overruled by operator
settings, basic communication procedures apply.

The behaviour of the temporary mode OIR is configured with the optional
\<default‑behaviour\> element. There are two values that this element
can take:

**- Presentation‑restricted**: This configures the service to behave as
specified in subclause 4.5.2.4 for the case OIR service in \"temporary
mode\" with default \"presentation-restricted\".

**- Presentation‑not‑restricted**: This configures the service to behave
as specified in subclause 4.5.2.4 for the case OIR service in
\"temporary mode\" with default \"presentation-not-restricted\".

Manipulation of the active attribute of the
\<originating‑identity‑presentation\> service element and of the
\<originating‑identity‑presentation‑restriction\> service element is
subject to authorization via local policy. Unauthorized manipulation
attempts are rejected with an HTTP 409 (Conflict) response as defined in
IETF RFC 4825 \[16\].

This annex provides an example of a filter criterion that triggers SIP
requests that are subject to\
Initial Filter Criteria (IFC) evaluation.

B.1 Originating filter criteria for OIR service
===============================================

All outgoing SIP requests are forwarded to an Application Server
providing the OIR service under the following conditions:

\- the user is subscribed to the OIR service in permanent mode; or

\- the request does not include a Privacy header field.
