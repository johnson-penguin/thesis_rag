4 Overview of personal network management 
=========================================

4.1 General
-----------

PNM applications consist of the PN redirection service and the PN access
control , both applying only to the terminating service, as described in
3GPP TS 22.259 \[2\] and 3GPP TS 23.259 \[15\]. The PN redirection is a
PNM application that enables redirecting a session addressed to any of
the UEs belonging to the PN to a certain UE or a certain PNE other than
a PN UE of their PN, i.e., the default UE or default PNE other than a PN
UE for terminating services. The PN access control is a PNM application
that enables users to exercise PN access control to restrict accesses to
certain UEs or certain PNEs other than PN UEs of their PN. The PN may
consist of UEs which are only privately accessed, that is each UE may be
accessed only by other UEs of the PN. The PN-User may additionally
modify the access levels of each UE of the PN to be public or private.
In this regard the PN behaves similar to a CUG as specified in
3GPP TS 22.085 \[19\] and 3GPP TS 23.085 \[20\], with Outgoing Access
and whether Incoming Access is allowed for the PN UE is dependent on the
PN access control list for that PN UE.

In order to make the above happen, the following procedures are provided
within this document:

\- procedures for PN-registration are specified in clause 6;

\- procedures for PN-configuration are specified in clause 7;

\- procedures for PN-query are specified in clause 8;

\- procedures for session redirection are specified in clause 9; and

\- procedures for restricting access to certain UEs are specified in
clause 10.

4.2 Network capabilities
------------------------

In order to support the PNM services the following network capabilities
are assumed:

1\) provision by the home network operator of PNM specific AS on the IM
CN subsystem, as specified in 3GPP TS 24.229 \[3\];

2\) support of CAMEL phase-3 and USSD as specified in
3GPP TS 29.078 \[13\] and 3GPP TS 24.090 \[14\].

5 Functional entities
=====================

5.1 Introduction
----------------

5.2 User Equipment (UE)
-----------------------

To be compliant with this document, a UE shall implement the role of a
PN UE (see subclause 6.2, subclause 7.2, subclause 8.2, subclause 9.2
and subclause 10.2).

The UE shall implement the XCAP client role as described in
subclause 11.2.1.

The UE shall implement HTTP digest authentication (see
3GPP TS 24.109 \[5\]).

The UE shall implement Transport Layer Security (TLS) according to the
TLS profile specified in 3GPP TS 33.310 \[24\] annex E.

The UE shall implement the GBA Function as described in
3GPP TS 33.220 \[8\].

The UE shall initiate a bootstrapping procedure with the bootstrapping
server function (BSF) located in the home network, as described in
3GPP TS 24.109 \[5\].

5.3 Application Server (AS)
---------------------------

The AS implementing PNM application shall implement the role of a XCAP
server (see subclause 11.2.2).

The AS implementing PNM application shall implement the Network
Application Function (NAF) as described in 3GPP TS 33.220 \[8\].

NOTE: For terminating services, the PNM Application in IM CN subsystem
is the first Application Server of any Application Servers in the path
of the call.

The AS implementing PNM application shall remove g.3gpp.pne-id media
feature tag containing IMEI included in the Contact header field of
requests and responses of SIP methods other than the SIP REGISTER method
prior to forwarding the request or response to the destination.

5.4 Authentication Proxy 
------------------------

The generic requirements for an authentication proxy are defined in
3GPP TS 24.109 \[5\].

6 Roles for PN-registration
===========================

6.1 Introduction
----------------

The PN-registration is the procedure where a UE is added to the PN, or a
PNE is added to the PAN. As a result of a successful registration, the
UE capabilities are conveyed to the PNM application.

6.2 PN UE
---------

If a PN UE supports the PN controller functionality and is configured to
act as a PN controller the PN UE shall include in the Contact header of
the REGISTER request a g.3gpp.iari\_ref feature tag containing the IARI
value defined in subclause 10.4.

Upon receiving a REGISTER request sent from a PNE other than a PN UE via
the PAN internal interface, the PN UE shall initiate a SIP REGISTER
request as defined in 3GPP TS 24.229 \[3\] subclause 5.1.1.2.1 with the
following addition:

1)  including in the Contact header field a g.3gpp.pne-id media feature
    tag containing the PNE identifier defined in subclause 6.4.

If using the multiple registrations mechanism for registering each PNE,
the PN UE shall use a different \"reg-id\" value when registering the
PNE.

If using SIP re-registration procedures for registering another PNE, the
PN UE includes a Contact header field for each registered PNE in the SIP
REGISTER request.

There are no PNM specific requirements for registration of the PN UE to
the CS domain.

6.3 PNM Application
-------------------

### 6.3.1 PN-registration procedure in the IM CN subsystem

The PNM AS can be configured with any of various options for obtaining
information from the IM CN subsystem specified in 3GPP TS 24.229 \[3\],
3GPP TS 29.328 \[9\] and 3GPP TS 29.329 \[12\], for example:

a\) receipt of REGISTER request which causes a third-party REGISTER
request containing in the body the incoming REGISTER request from the PN
UE and the 200 (OK) response to the incoming REGISTER request to be sent
to the PNM application. The PNM application may then obtain information
from the body of the third-party REGISTER request;

b\) receipt of REGISTER request which causes a third-party REGISTER
request containing in the body a \<service-info\> element containing the
private user identity of the PN UE to be sent to the PNM application.
The PNM application may then subscribe to the reg event package for that
user to obtain information; or

c\) receipt of REGISTER request which causes a third-party REGISTER
request containing in the body a \<service-info\> element containing the
private user identity of the PN UE to be sent to the PNM application.
The PNM application may then use the Sh interface to obtain information.

This document places no requirement on the use of all or any of these
mechanisms.

After successful PN-registration, the PNM AS shall enrol the public user
identity of the registered PN UE or the registered PNE identifier in the
data base.

### 6.3.2 PN-registration procedure in the CS domain

When the gsmSCF (CAMEL service for PNM) receives a MAP\_NOTE\_MM\_EVENT
message sent from the VLR to report that the status of the UE set to
'attached', the gsmSCF sets the UE registration status in the PN to
'registered' and sends the UE status to the PNM AS.

NOTE: The interface between the gsmSCF and the PNM AS is unspecified.

When the gsmSCF (CAMEL service for PNM) receives a MAP\_NOTE\_MM\_EVENT
message sent from the VLR to report that the status of the UE set to
'detached', the gsmSCF sets the UE registration status in the PN to
'deregistered' and checks whether the PN UE was the only default UE in
the PN. If it was the only default UE in the PN, the gsmSCF generates a
USSD Notify message to the HSS to inform the user.

6.4 Definition of media feature tag g.3gpp.pne-id
-------------------------------------------------

Media feature-tag name: g.3gpp.pne-id

ASN.1 Identifier: 1.3.6.1.8.2.8

Summary of the media feature indicated by this tag: This media
feature-tag when used in a SIP request or a SIP response indicates the
identifier of a PNE other than a UE.

Values appropriate for use with this feature-tag: URN. When an IMEI is
available, the URN shall take the form of a IMEI URN (see
IETF RFC 7254 \[22\]). If no IMEI is available, the URN shall take the
form of a string representation of a UUID as a URN as defined in
IETF RFC 4122 \[23\].

The feature-tag is intended primarily for use in the following
applications, protocols, services, or negotiation mechanisms: This
feature-tag is most useful in a communications application, for
describing the capabilities of a device, such as a PC or PDA.

Examples of typical use: Indicating the identifier of a device which is
part of a Personal Area Network.

Related standards or documents: 3GPP TS 24.259: \"Personal Network
Management (PNM), stage 3\".

Security Considerations:

UE is not allowed to include g.3gpp.pne-id media feature tag containing
IMEI in the Contact header field of requests and responses of SIP
methods other than the SIP REGISTER method except when the request or
response is guaranteed to be sent to a trusted intermediary that will
remove the g.3gpp.pne-id media feature tag prior to forwarding the
request or response to the destination. Other security considerations
for this media feature-tag are discussed in subclause 12.1 of
IETF RFC 3840 \[21\].

7 Roles for PN-configuration
============================

7.1 Introduction
----------------

This clause specifies the PN-configuration and PN-deconfiguration
procedures for supporting PN UE redirection, PN access control and PN UE
name changing.

NOTE: A text string together with angled brackets (e.g. \<PNUEName\>)
represents an XML element defined by the XML schema in Annex B.

Subclause A.3 provides examples of signalling flows for PN-configuration
and PN-deconfiguration.

7.2 PN UE
---------

In order for the PN UE to initiate the PN-configuration procedure for
creating/replacing or deleting an XML document, an element within an XML
document or an attribute of an element within an XML document, the PN UE
shall know the data structure and constraints defined by the PNM XML
schema in annex B. The PN UE shall also know what HTTP URI to use based
on the naming conventions for constructing the HTTP URIs described in
annex C.

The PN UE initiates the PN-configuration procedure or the
PN-deconfiguration procedure by sending a HTTP PUT request or a HTTP
DELETE request message with:

\- Request-URI field indicating to the PNM application the desired
location where the XML document, an element within an XML document or an
attribute of an element within an XML document which is requested to be
configured as follows:

\- if the PN-configuration procedure performed for configuring an XML
document, the Request-URI is constructed with a document URI pointing to
the XML document;

\- if the PN-configuration procedure performed for configuring an
element within an XML document, the document selector of the Request-URI
is constructed with a document URI pointing to the XML document
containing the element to be configured, and the node selector of the
Request-URI with a node URI identifying the element to be configured;

\- if the PN-configuration procedure performed for configuring an
attribute of an element within an XML document, the document selector of
the Request-URI is constructed with a document URI pointing to the XML
document containing the element to be queried and the node selector of
the Request-URI with a node URI identifying the attribute to be
configured;

\- Host field indicating the Internet host and port number of the PNM
application;

\- User-Agent field containing information about the user agent
originating the request and the static string (e.g. 3gpp-gba) to
indicate to the NAF that the UE supports 3GPP-bootstrapping based
authentication;

\- Referer field indicating the address (URI) of the resource from which
the URI for the PNM application is obtained;

\- Authorization field containing the credentials obtained by means of
executing the bootstrapping procedure with the BSF as described in
3GPP TS 33.220 \[8\];

\- Content-Type field indicating

\- \"application/pnm+xml\", if the PN-configuration is performed for
configuring an XML document;

\- \"application/xcap-el+xml\" as in IETF RFC 4825 \[6\], if the
PN-configuration is performed for configuring an element within an XML
document;

\- \"application/xcap-att+xml\" as in IETF RFC 4825 \[6\], if the
PN-configuration is performed for configuring an attribute of an element
within an XML document;

If the PN-configuration is performed for creating/replacing the XML
document for the PN UE redirection purpose, the XML body of the HTTP PUT
request message shall contain:

> \- the \<RedirectedUserID\> containing the children \<PNUEID\> and
> \<PNUEName\>, and the \<RedirectingUserID\> with a unique value for
> the \"id\" attribute containing the children \<PNUEID\> and
> \<PNUEName\>, as well as the \<RedirectionLevel\> and the
> \<RedirectionPrio\>;

NOTE: A PN user decides the value of the \<RedirectionLevel\> element
based on the PN UE capabilities. According to the requirements of
3GPP TS 22.259 \[2\], this document supports three values (a global
level for all services, a service level for selected services and a
service component level for different media).

\- the value of the \"UriOfRedirectedUser\" attribute for the
\<UERedirection\> shall be populated with the public user identity of
the PN UE configured by the PN UE to be redirected and indicated by the
\<RedirectedUserID\>.

If the PN-configuration is performed for creating/replacing the XML
document for the PNE redirection purpose, the XML body of the HTTP PUT
request message shall contain:

> \- the \<RedirectedUserID\> containing the children \<PNUEID\>,
> \<PNEID\> and \<PNEName\>, and the \<RedirectingUserID\> with a unique
> value for the \"id\" attribute containing the children \<PNEID\> and
> \<PNEName\>, as well as the \<RedirectionLevel\> and the
> \<RedirectionPrio\>;

NOTE: A PN user decides the value of the \<RedirectionLevel\> element
based on the PNE capabilities. According to the requirements of
3GPP TS 22.259 \[2\], this document supports three values (a global
level for all services, a service level for selected services and a
service component level the different media).

\- the value of the \"UriOfRedirectedUser\" attribute for the
\<PNERedirection\> shall be populated with the GRUU of the PNE
configured by the PNE to be redirected and indicated by the
\<RedirectedUserID\>.

If the PN-configuration is performed for creating/replacing the XML
document for the PN access control purpose, the XML body of the HTTP PUT
request message shall contain:

> \- the \<ControllerUE\> containing the children \<PNUEID\> and
> \<PNUEName\>, the \<ControlleeUE\> with a unique value for the \"id\"
> attribute containing children \<PNUEID\> and \<PNUEName\>, and the
> \<PNAccessControlList\> and \<PNAccessControlType\>;
>
> \- the value of the \"UriOfControllerUE\" attribute of the
> \<AccessControl\> shall be populated with the public user identity of
> the controller UE indicated by the \<ControllerUE\>.

If the PN-configuration is performed for creating/replacing the XML
document for the PNE access control purpose, the XML body of the HTTP
PUT request message shall contain:

> \- the \<ControllerUE\> containing the children \<PNUEID\> and
> \<PNUEName\>, the \<ControlleePNE\> with a unique value for the \"id\"
> attribute containing children \<PNUEID\>, \<PNEID\> and \<PNEName\>,
> and the \<PNAccessControlList\> and \<PNAccessControlType\>;
>
> \- the value of the \"UriOfControllerUE\" attribute of the
> \<AccessControl\> shall be populated with the public user identity of
> the controller UE indicated by the \<ControllerUE\>

NOTE: The PNE here stands for the PNE other than a PN UE, i.e. ME, MT or
TE of a PAN.

If the PN-configuration is performed for the PN UE name changing
purpose, and if the PN UE does not know the value of the \"id\"
attribute of the \<UEName\> to be changed, the UE shall first initiate
the PN-query procedure as specified in clause 8 in order to cache a copy
of the XML document containing the value of the \"id\" attribute of that
\<UEName\>.The XML body of the HTTP PUT request message shall contain:

\- the \<PNUEID\> identified by the shared public user identity, the
\<UEName\> containing an \"id\" attribute with the attribute value
pointing to the \<UEName\> to be changed and the \<Name\> to be changed.

If the PN-configuration is performed for configuring an element within
an XML document, the XML body of the HTTP request message shall contain:

\- the XML element to be configured.

If the PN-configuration is performed for configuring an attribute of an
element within an XML document, the XML body of the HTTP request message
shall contain:

\- the value of the attribute of an element to be configured.

7.3 PNM application
-------------------

In order for the PNM application to support the PN-configuration
procedure for creating/replacing or deleting an XML document, an element
within an XML document or an attribute of an element within an XML
document, the PNM application shall know the data structure and
constraints imposed by the PNM XML schema in annex B. The PNM
application shall also be configured to be able to handle the HTTP URIs
described in annex C.

Upon receiving a HTTP PUT request or a HTTP DELETE request message, the
PNM application verifies the Authorization header by using the
bootstrapping transaction identifier B-TID and the key material Ks\_NAF
obtained from the BSF (as described in 3GPP TS 33.220 \[8\]). If the
verification succeeds, the PNM application obtains the private user
identity associated with the received public user identity. The PNM
application then authorizes the PN UE by comparing the received public
user identity with the preconfigured one identified by the private user
identity.

If the authorization succeeds, the PNM application shall perform the
requested action and generate a response in accordance with
IETF RFC 4825 \[6\].

8 Roles for PN-query
====================

8.1 Introduction
----------------

This clause specifies the PN-query procedure.

Annex A.3 provides examples of signalling flows for PN-query.

8.2 PN UE
---------

In order for the PN UE to initiate the PN-configuration procedure for
querying an XML document, an element within an XML document or an
attribute of an element within an XML document, the PN UE shall know the
data structure and constraints defined by the PNM XML schema in annex B.
The PN UE shall also know what HTTP URI to use based on the naming
conventions for constructing the HTTP URIs described in annex C.

The PN UE initiates the PN-query procedure by sending a HTTP GET request
message with:

\- Request-URI field indicating to the PNM application the desired
location of an XML document, an element within an XML document or an
attribute of an element within an XML document which is queried as
follows:

\- if an XML document is queried, the Request-URI is constructed with a
document URI pointing to the XML document;

\- if an element within an XML document is queried, the document
selector of the Request-URI is constructed with a document URI pointing
to the XML document containing the element to be queried and the node
selector of the Request-URI with a node URI identifying the element to
be queried;

\- if an attribute of an element within an XML document is queried, the
document selector of the Request-URI is constructed with a document URI
pointing to the XML document containing the element to be queried and
the node selector of the Request-URI with a node URI identifying the
attribute to be queried.

\- Host field indicating the Internet host and port number of the PNM
application;

\- User-Agent field containing information about the user agent
originating the request and the static string (e.g. 3gpp-gba) to
indicate to the NAF that the UE supports 3GPP-bootstrapping based
authentication;

\- Referer field indicating the address (URI) of the resource from which
the URI for the PNM application is obtained;

\- Authorization field containing the credentials obtained by means of
executing the bootstrapping procedure with the BSF as described in
3GPP TS 33.220 \[8\].

8.3 PNM application
-------------------

In order for the PNM application to support the PN-configuration
procedure for querying an XML document, an element within an XML
document or an attribute of an element within an XML document, the PNM
application shall know the data structure and constraints imposed by the
PNM XML schema in annex B. The PNM application shall also be configured
to be able to handle the HTTP URIs described in annex C.

Upon receiving a HTTP GET request message, the PNM application verifies
the Authorization header by using the bootstrapping transaction
identifier B-TID and the key material Ks\_NAF obtained from the BSF (as
described in 3GPP TS 33.220 \[8\]).

If the verification succeeds, the PNM application shall perform the
requested action and generate a response in accordance with
IETF RFC 4825 \[6\] with an XML body containing either the XML document,
or the element within an XML document or the attribute of an element
within an XML document as queried by the PN UE.

9 Roles for PN redirection 
==========================

9.1 Introduction
----------------

The PN redirection redirects sessions containing in the Request-URI the
address of any UEs of a PN to the default UE or the default PNE other
than a PN UE of the same PN as described in 3GPP TS 22.259 \[2\] and in
3GPP TS 23.259 \[15\].

9.2 PN UE
---------

There is no PNM specific requirement for the PN UE redirection.

Upon receiving a SIP INVITE request containing in the Request-URI the
address of a PNE, the UE shall forward the SIP INVITE request to the PNE
via the PAN internal interface.

NOTE: The PAN internal interface is out of scope of this document.

9.3 PNM application
-------------------

### 9.3.1 PN UE redirection procedure in the IM CN subsystem

When the PNM AS receives an initial request containing in the
Request-URI the address of a UE or a PNE other than a PN UE that exists
in the PN configuration due to the terminating initial filter criteria,
the PNM AS shall verify if the address in the Request-URI exists in a
\<RedirectingUserID\> element in the PN configuration. If there is a
matching \<RedirectingUserID\> element the PNM AS shall send an initial
request of the same SIP Method on a new dialog to the URI contained in
the \<RedirectedUserID\> element. The PNM AS then routes the initial
request based on the standard call setup procedures as specified in
3GPP TS 24.229 \[3\].

NOTE: The PNM AS is triggered first by forming the initial filter
criteria in the S-CSCF.

The PNM AS shall include in the request the following:

a\) a Request-URI set to the SIP URI contained in the
\<RedirectedUserID\> element (e.g. a public user identity or a GRUU);

b\) a From header set to the SIP URI of the PNM AS;

c\) a To header set to the URI contained in the \<RedirectedUserID\>
element;

d\) a P-Asserted-Identity header set to the contents of the
P-Asserted-Identity header in the original initial request;

e\) a Contact header set to the IP address or FQDN of the PNM AS;

f\) a Supported header containing the option tags from the original
initial request with the addition of the option tag \"histinfo\";

g\) a History-Info header that includes as the Targeted-to-URI the URI
from the Request-URI of the original initial request, and as the next
branch index URI, the contents of the Request-URI of this request.

h\) a Accept-Contact header with a g.3gpp.pne-id media feature tag
containing the PNE identifier or media feature tag containing the
requested device capabilites along with the parameters \"require\" and
\"explicit\".

If the PNM AS receives in response a 4xx, 5xx or 6xx response, and there
exist more \<RedirectedUserID\> elements in the PN configuration which
have not had the request forwarded to them yet, then the PNM AS shall
send an initial request of the same SIP Method on a new dialog to the
URI of the UE or the PNE other than a PN UEcontained in the next lower
priority \<PNController\> element as above.

Otherwise, if there does not exist more \<RedirectedUserID\> elements in
the PN configuration which have not had the request forwarded to them
yet, then the PNM AS shall forward the response back towards the
originator of the initial request.

If the PNM AS receives in response a 200 (OK) response, the PNM AS shall
forward the response back towards the originator of the initial request.

### 9.3.2 PN UE redirection procedure in the CS domain

When the PNM application receives an indication that the gsmSCF has
received a CAMEL IDP relating to a terminating call, the PNM application
shall:

1\) check if the re-direction is applicable for the call on the basis of
service key and called party number received in CAMEL IDP message.

2\) if the call is not subject to re-direction, cause the gsmSCF to
respond with a CAMEL CONTINUE and no further PNM specific procedures are
performed on this call.

3\) if the call is subject to re-direction, retrieve the Destination
Routing Address.

4\) if the call is subject to re-direction, cause the gsmSCF to respond
with a CAMEL CONNECT message with the Destination Routing Address set to
the MSISDN of default UE.

When the PNM application receives an indication that the gsmSCF has
received a EventReportBCSM message indicating that the default UE cannot
setup the session/call, the PNM application shall:

1\) retrive the Destination Routing Address of the other UE of the next
lower priority based on the PN-configuration.

2\) cause the gsmSCF to respond with a CAMEL CONNECT message with the
Destination Routing Address set to the MSISDN of the selected UE.

3\) if there are no more UEs selected for redirection, cause the gsmSCF
to respond with a CAMEL CONTINUE and no further PNM specific procedures
are performed on this call.

10 Roles for PN access control
==============================

10.1 Introduction
-----------------

The PN access control procedure enables the controller UE to exercise
access control to restrict accesses to certain PN controllee UE(s) of
the PN, or certain controllee PNE(s) other than the UE as described in
3GPP TS 23.259 \[15\].

10.2 PN UE
----------

When the PN UE that supports the PN controller functionality and that is
configured to act as a PN controller receives an initial request
containing an Accept-Contact header containing a g.3gpp.iari\_ref
feature tag containing the IARI value defined in subclause 10.4 and a
target URI-parameter in the Request-URI, then the PN UE shall perform
the PN controller function and indicate to the user that the PN
controller UE has received a request for the PN controllee UE, otherwise
the PN UE shall not perform the PN controller function and shall follow
the UE terminating case procedures in 3GPP TS 24.229 \[3\].

When performing the PN controller function the PN UE shall:

a\) indicate the PN controllee UE indicated by the URI in the target
URI-parameter contained in the Request-URI;

b\) indicate the identity of the originating user indicated in the
P-Asserted-Identity header.

The PN UE may offer the user the following options:

a\) allow the request to be forwarded to the PN controllee UE;

b\) deny the request (i.e reject the session);

c\) accept the request (i.e establish the session).

When allowing the request to be forwarded to the PN controllee UE the PN
UE shall send a 302 (Moved Temporarily) response. In the 302 (Moved
Temporarily) response the PN UE shall:

a\) include a Contact header containing the URI from the target
URI-parameter in the Request-URI of the incoming request;

b\) include a History-Info header copied from the incoming request
unless the user wishes not to reveal to the user of the PN controllee UE
that the request was forwarded first to the PN controller UE.

When the user allows the request to be forwarded to the PN controllee UE
the PN UE may allow the user to add the URI from the P-Asserted-Identity
header to a \<PNAccessControlList\> using the procedure in
subclause 7.2.

When denying the request to be forwarded to the PN controllee UE the PN
UE shall send either:

a\) a 480 (Temporarily Unavailable) response if the user wishes to not
allow the PN controllee UE to receive requests from the originator at
this time but may allow requests at some future time;

b\) a 410 (Gone) response if the user wishes to not allow the PN
controllee UE to receive requests from the originator at any time but
wishes the originator to not know that the request was actively blocked;
or

c\) a 403 (Forbidden) response if the user wishes to not allow the PN
controllee UE to receive requests from the originator at any time and
wishes the originator to know that the request was actively blocked.

The PN UE should only send a 480 (Temporarily Unavailable) response to
the PN controller request when the user has specifically denied the
request as this will prevent the request being forwarded to other PN
controller UEs. When the user allows the request to be forwarded to the
PN controllee UE the PN UE may allow the user to add the URI from the
P-Asserted-Identity header to a \<PNAccessControlList\> using the
procedure in subclause 7.2.

When the user accepts the request the PN UE shall follow the procedures
in 3GPP TS 24.229 \[3\].

When a PN UE that does not support the PN controller functionality or
that is not configured to act as a PN controller (i.e a PN controllee
UE) receives an initial request the PN UE shall follow the UE
terminating case procedures in 3GPP TS 24.229 \[3\].

10.2A PN UE procedures supporting PNE access control
----------------------------------------------------

When the controllee is the PNE(s) other than the UE, the PN UE
procedures in subclause 10.2 apply except that the references to \"PN
controllee UE\" are replaced by \"controllee PNE\".

10.3 PNM application
--------------------

### 10.3.1 PN access control procedure in the IM CN subsystem

When the PNM AS receives an initial request containing in the
Request-URI the address of a PN UE within the same PN as the originating
PN UE the PNM AS shall allow the request to continue normally.

When the PNM AS receives an initial request from a UE that is not a
member of the same PN as the PN UE that\'s address is contained in the
Request-URI and the PN Access Control is not enabled the PNM AS shall
return a 403 (Forbidden) response.

When the PNM AS receives an initial request from a UE that is not a
member of the same PN as the PN UE that\'s address is contained in the
Request-URI and the address in the Request-URI exists in a
\<PNController\> element in the PN access control list the PNM AS shall
allow the request to continue normally.

When the PNM AS receives an initial request due to the terminating
initial filter criteria, from a UE that is not a member of the same PN
as the PN UE that\'s address is contained in the Request-URI and the
address in the Request-URI exists in a \<PNControllee\> element in the
PN access control list the PNM AS shall verify if the address in the
P-Asserted-Identity exists in a \<PNAccessControlList\> element in the
PN access control list.

NOTE: The PNM AS is triggered first by forming the initial filter
criteria in the S-CSCF.

If there is a matching \<PNAccessControlList\> element the PNM AS shall
allow the request to continue normally.

If there is no matching \<PNAccessControlList\> element the PNM AS shall
send an initial request of the same SIP Method on a new dialog to the
URI of the PN controller UE contained in the \<PNController\> element if
it exists. If no \<PNController\> element exists then the PNM AS shall
return a 403 (Forbidden) response. When sending the initial request to
the PN controller UE the PNM AS shall include in the request the
following:

a\) a Request-URI set to the SIP URI contained in the \<PNController\>
element along with a target URI-Parameter as defined in
IETF RFC 4458 \[17\] set to the URI from the Request-URI of the original
initial request;

b\) a From header set to the SIP URI of the PNM AS;

c\) a To header set to the URI contained in the \<PNController\>
element;

d\) a P-Asserted-Identity header set to the contents of the
P-Asserted-Identity header in the original initial request;

e\) a Contact header set to the IP address or FQDN of the PNM AS;

f\) a Supported header containing the option tags from the original
initial request with the addition of the option tag \"histinfo\";

g\) a History-Info header that includes as the Targeted-to-URI the URI
from the Request-URI of the original initial request, and as the next
branch index URI, the contents of the Request-URI of this request
including the target URI-parameter along with the index parameters as
specified in IETF RFC 4244 \[16\];

h\) an Accept-Contact header containing the g.3gpp.iari\_ref feature tag
containing the IARI value
\<urn:urn-7:3gpp-application.ims.iari.PNM-Controller\>.

If the PNM AS receives in response a 302 (Moved Temporarily) response
the PNM AS shall redirect the original incoming request to the URI
contained in the Contact header of the 302 (Moved Temporarily) response.
The PNM AS shall add to the request the following:

a\) a Request-URI set to the SIP URI contained in the Contact header of
the 302 (Moved Temporarily) response;

b\) a Supported header containing the option tags from the original
initial request with the addition of the option tag \"hist-info\";

c\) a History-Info header that includes the URIs from the History-Info
header in the 302 (Moved Temporarily) response along with the contents
of the Request-URI of this request as the next branch index URI under
the top level Targeted-to-URI, along with the appropriate index
parameter as specified in IETF RFC 4244 \[16\], if the 302 (Moved
Temporarily) response contains a History-Info header;

If the PNM AS receives in response a 4xx (other than a 403 (Forbidden)
response or 410 (Gone) response or 480 (Temporarily Unavailable)
response), 5xx or 6xx response and there exist more \<PNController\>
elements in the PN access control list which have not had the request
forwarded to yet, then the PNM AS shall send an initial request of the
same SIP Method on a new dialog to the URI of the PN controller UE
contained in the \<PNController\> element as above except that the
History-Info header shall include the URIs from the History-Info header
in the 302 (Moved Temporarily) response and as the next branch index
URI, the contents of the Request-URI of this request including the
target URI-parameter along with the index parameters as specified in
IETF RFC 4244 \[16\];

Otherwise, if there do not exist more \<PNController\> elements in the
PN access control list which have not had the request forwarded to yet,
then forward the response back towards the originator of the initial
request.

If the PNM AS receives in response a 200 (OK) response, a 403
(Forbidden) response, a 410 (Gone) response or 480 (Temporarily
Unavailable) response the PNM AS shall forward the response back towards
the originator of the initial request.

### 10.3.2 PN access control procedure in the CS domain

When the PNM application receives an indication that the gsmSCF has
received a CAMEL IDP message related to a terminating call, the PNM
application shall:

1\) check if access control is applicable on the basis of the service
key and called party number received in the CAMEL IDP message.

2\) if the call is not subject to access control, cause the gsmSCF to
respond with a CAMEL CONTINUE and no further PNM specific procedures are
performed on this call.

3\) if the call is subject to access control, it causes the gsmSCF to
perform as follows:

a\) check if the calling party is configured in the PN access control
list.

b\) if the calling party is configured in the PN access control list,
cause the gsmSCF to respond with a CAMEL CONTINUE message to the GMSC.

c\) if the calling party is not configured in the PN access control
list, cause the gsmSCF to generate the USSD request message to the
controller UE.

4\) based on the controller's response cause the gsmSCF to respond with
a CAMEL CONTINUE message or a CALL RELEASE message to the GMSC.

10.4 PNM controller IMS application reference identifier
--------------------------------------------------------

The URN used to define the IARI for the PNM controller application:
value urn:urn-7:3gpp-application.ims.iari.pnm-controller. The URN is
registered at http://www.3gpp.com/Uniform-Resource-Name-URN-list.html.

Summary of the URN: This URN indicates that the device supports the PNM
controller application

The URN is intended primarily for use in the following applications,
protocols, services, or negotiation mechanisms:

\- This URN is most useful in a communications application, for
describing the capabilities of a device, such as a phone or PDA.

Examples of typical use: Indicating that a mobile phone supports the PNM
controller application.

11 Protocol at the Ut reference point
=====================================

11.1 Introduction
-----------------

The XML Configuration Access Protocol (XCAP) is used to create, read,
write, modify and delete data related to the PNM service. XCAP uses the
HTTP methods PUT, GET and DELETE for communication over the Ut reference
point.

11.2 Roles
----------

### 11.2.1 XCAP client

The XCAP client is a logical function as defined in IETF RFC 4825 \[6\].
The XCAP client provides the means to create, read, write, modify and
delete the data used for the PNM services. In doing so, it shall
generate an HTTP PUT, or an HTTP GET or an HTTP DELETE request in
accordance with IETF RFC 2616 \[7\] and 3GPP TS 24.623 \[18\].

### 11.2.2 XCAP server

The XCAP server is a logical function as defined in IETF RFC 4825 \[6\].
The XCAP server stores all data relevant for the PNM services. When the
XCAP server receives an HTTP PUT, HTTP GET or HTTP DELETE request for
manipulating the data base, the XCAP server shall first authenticate the
request in accordance with 3GPP TS 24.109 \[5\] and then perform
authorization. Afterwards the XCAP server shall perform the requested
action and generate a response in accordance with IETF RFC 2616 \[7\]
and 3GPP TS 24.623 \[18\].

######## Annex A (informative): Example signalling flows 

A.1 Scope of signalling flows
=============================

This annex gives examples of signalling flows for Personal Network
Management based on XCAP, the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) and SIP
Events.

These signalling flows provide detailed signalling flows, which expand
on the overview information flows provided in 3GPP TS 23.259 \[15\].

A.2 Introduction
================

A.2.1 General
-------------

The signalling flows provided in this annex follow the methodology
developed in 3GPP TS 24.228 \[10\]. The following additional
considerations apply:

a\) 3GPP TS 24.228 \[10\] shows separate signalling flows with no
configuration hiding between networks, and with configuration hiding
between networks. There is no personal network management specific
functionality associated with this hiding, and therefore such separate
signalling flows are not shown in the present document;

b\) 3GPP TS 24.228 \[10\] does not show the functionality between the
S-CSCF and the AS. As personal network management depends on the
functionality provided by various AS, the signalling flows between
S-CSCF and AS are shown in the present document;

c\) 3GPP TS 24.228 \[10\] breaks down the functionality of the various
CSCFs. Such intervening activity in the CSCFs is in general not relevant
to showing the functionality within personal network management, and
therefore the CSCFs are often collapsed into a single entity labelled
\"Intermediate IM CN subsystem entities\";

d\) where entities are combined as in c) above, and the signalling flow
is directed to such a combined entity, the contents of the signalling
flow represent the contents of the sending entity except when otherwise
stated;

e\) where entities are combined as in c) above and the signalling flow
originates at such a combined entity, the contents of the signalling
flow represent the contents of the receiving entity except when
otherwise stated;

f\) within the CS domain, both ISUP and BICC can be used. The signalling
flows represent only the ISUP signalling flows, and the BICC signalling
flows (which can be assumed to be similar with no additional PNM
specific content) are not shown; and

g\) additional functionality from 3GPP releases 6, 7 and 8 over and
above that shown in 3GPP TS 24.228 \[10\] is incorporated in these.

A.2.2 Key required to interpret signalling flows
------------------------------------------------

The key to interpret signalling flows specified in 3GPP TS 24.228 \[10\]
subclauses 4.1 and 4.2 applies with the additions specified below:

-   Consistent with the conventions used in 3GPP TS 24.228 \[10\]
    home1.net is used for the home network of the originating user and
    home2.net is used for the home network of the terminating user. In
    registration and configuration flows the PN UE and PNM network
    elements are considered to be in home1.net, however in scenarios
    such as PN redirection and PNM access control where the PNM elements
    are in the terminating network the PN UE and PNM network elements
    are considered to be in home2.net. Therefore in some flows
    identities shown as home2.net are equivalent to the identities shown
    as home1.net in other flows and as described further below.

For signaling flows for PN-registration (see subclause A.3.2) and
PN-configuration (see subclause A.3.3) the following applies:

\- pnmas.home1.net:1234 represents the Internet host and port number of
the PNM AS, which can be obtained by a PN UE from the address (URI) of
the resource http://pnmas.home1.net:1234/service.

\- PN\_user1\_public1\@home1.net, PN\_user1\_public2\@home1.net, etc.
represent the public user identities configured for a PN-user for the PN
UE\#1. PN\_user2\_public1\@home1.net, PN\_user2\_public2\@home1.net,
etc. represent the public user identities configured for a PN-user for
the PN UE\#2, etc. PN\_user\_public\@home1.net represents the shared
public user identity.

\- PN\_user1\_private\@home1.net represents the private user identity
configured for a PN-user for PN UE\#1. PN\_user2\_private\@home1.net
represents the private user identity configured for a PN-user for PN
UE\#2, etc.

\- PN\_user1\_friend\_public1\@home1.net,
PN\_user1\_friend\_public2\@home1.net etc represent the public user
identities of a PN access control list configured for PN UE\#1.
PN\_user2\_friend\_public1\@home1.net,
PN\_user2\_friend\_public2\@home1.net etc represent the public user
identities of a PN access control list configured for PN UE\#2, etc.

\- PN\_user1\_public1\_old and PN\_user1\_public1\_new represent the old
and the new PN UE names related to the public user identity
PN\_user1\_public1\@home1.net, PN\_user2\_public1\_old and
PN\_user2\_public1\_new represent the old and the new PN UE names
related to the public user identity PN\_user2\_public1\@home1.net.

For signaling flows for PN UE redirection (see subclause A.3.4), PN
access control (see subclause A.3.5) and inter-domain networking (see
subclause A.3.6) the following applies:

\- PN\_user1\_public\@home2.net, PN\_user2\_public\@home2.net, etc.
represent the public user identities for the PN UEs;

-   user1\_public1\@home1.net represents a user outside of the personal
    > network originating a session to a user within the personal
    > network.

In order to differentiate between messages for HTTP, SIP, Diameter and
media flows over CS and PS connections, the notation in figure A.2.2-1
is used.

A.3 Signalling flows 
====================

A.3.1 Introduction
------------------

The signalling flows demonstrate how the PN-registration,
PN-configuration, PN UE redirection and PN access control procedures
work. The following signalling flows are included:

\- subclause A.3.2.1 shows the successful PN-registration in the IM CN
subsystem using third party registration;

\- subclause A.3.2.2 shows the successful PN-registration with
subscription to reg event package;

\- subclause A.3.3.1 shows the successful PN-configuration for PN UE
redirection;

\- subclause A.3.3.2 shows the successful PN-configuration for PN access
control;

\- subclause A.3.3.3 shows the successful PN-configuration for changing
PN UE name;

\- subclause A.3.3.4 shows the successful PN-query;

\- subclause A.3.3.5 shows the successful PN-deconfiguration;

\- subclause A.3.4.1 shows the successful PN UE redirection in the IM CN
subsystem;

\- subclause A.3.4.2 shows the successful PN UE redirection in the CS
domain;

\- subclause A.3.5.1 shows the successful PN access control procedure in
IM CN subsystem;

\- subclause A.3.5.2 shows the successful PN access control procedure in
CS domain;

\- subclause A.3.6.1 shows the successful interdomain networking (IM CN
subsystem to CS domain);

\- subclause A.3.6.2 shows the successful interdomain networking (CS
domain to IM CN subsystem).

A.3.2 Signalling flows for PN-registration
------------------------------------------

### A.3.2.1 PN-registration in the IM CN subsystem using third party registration

Figure A.3.2.1-1 details the signalling flows for a successful
PN-registration in the IM CN subsystem using third party registration.
In this scenario the PN UE also performs the PN controller function.

### A.3.2.3 PN-registration procedure for PNE other than a PN UE

Figure A.3.2.3-1 details the signalling flows for a successful
PN-registration in the IM CN subsystem for two PNEs other than a PN UE.

Figure A.3.2.3-1: Successful PN-registration signalling for PNE other
than a PN UE

**1. Register request**

PNE1 sends a Register request towards UE via the PAN internal interface.
The Register request may contain the PNE identifier.

**2. SIP REGISTER request (PN UE to IM CN subsystem entities)- see
example in table  A.3.2.3-2.**

The PN UE initiates a SIP REGISTER request on behalf the PNE1. The PNE1
identifier is conveyed in the g.3gpp.pne-id media feature tag of the
Contact header field to indicate this is registration for the PNE. The
value of \"reg-id\" is set to 2.

NOTE: In this case, a successful authentication has been done before
sending the SIP REGISTER request.

After successful registration, the PNE1 is registered into the PAN, i.e.
save the bindings between UE and PNE identifiers in the database.

**12. Register request**

PNE2 sends a Register request towards UE via the PAN internal interface.
The Register request may contain the PNE2 identifier.

**13. SIP REGISTER request (PN UE to IM CN subsystem entities)- see
example in table  A.3.2.3-13.**

The PN UE initiates a SIP REGISTER request on behalf the PNE2. The PNE2
identifier is conveyed in the g.3gpp.pne-id media feature tag of the
Contact header field to indicate this is registration for the PNE2. The
value of \"reg-id\" is set to 3 to not override the previous
registration for PNE2.

-------------------------------------------

### A.3.3.1 PN-configuration for PN UE redirection

Figure A.3.3.1-1 shows the message exchange between PN UE and NAF/PNM AS
when the PN UE wants to configure the PN settings for the PN UE
redirection. The messaging only takes place after a successful
bootstrapping procedure (as described in 3GPP TS 33.220 \[8\]) in which
case the bootstrapped security association has been established before
step 1.

**1. Initial PN-configuration request (PN UE to NAF/PNM AS) - see
example in table A.3.3.1-1**

The PN UE sends an HTTP request to the NAF/PNM AS containing the
configuration request for the PN UE redirection.

2\. **Authentication/authorization and UE capability and subscription
checking**

The NAF/PNM AS verifies the Authorization header by using the
bootstrapping transaction identifier B-TID and the key material Ks\_NAF
obtained from BSF (as described in 3GPP TS 33.220 \[8\]). NAF/PNM AS
calculates the corresponding digest values using Ks\_NAF, and compares
the calculated values with the received values in the Authorization
header. If the verification succeeds, the NAF passes the private user
identity \<sip: PN\_user1\_private\@home1.net\> associated with the
public user identity \<sip: PN\_user1\_public1\@home1.net\> to the PNM
AS. The PNM AS then authorizes the UE by comparing the received public
user identity \<sip: PN\_user1\_public1\@home1.net\> with the
preconfigured one identified by the private user identity \<sip:
PN\_user1\_private\@home1.net\>. If the authorization succeeds, the
incoming request is taken in for further processing.

The NAF/PNM AS also performs the PN UE capability and subscription
checking. If the checking succeeds, the incoming request is taken in for
further processing.

NOTE: Performing the PN UE subscription checking entails the interaction
with the HSS over the sh interface (see 3GPP TS 29.328 \[9\]) which is
not shown in the message flow.

3\. **Delivery of PN-configuration response (NAF/PNM AS to PN UE) - see
example in table A.3.3-3**

The PNM AS sends a HTTP 200 OK response to the PN UE to indicate the
success of the PN-configuration.

### A.3.3.2 PN-configuration for PN access control

Figure A.3.3.2-1 shows the message exchange between PN UE and NAF/PNM AS
when the PN UE wants to configure the PN settings for the PN access
control service. The messaging only takes place after a successful
bootstrapping procedure (as described in 3GPP TS 33.220 \[8\]) in which

### A.3.3.4 PN-query 

Figure A.3.3.4-1 shows the message exchange between PN UE and NAF/PNM AS
when the PN UE wants to obtain the PN setting information from the PNM
AS. The messaging only takes place after a successful bootstrapping
procedure (as described in 3GPP TS 33.220 \[8\]) in which case the
bootstrapped security association has been established before step 1.

### A.3.4.2 PN UE redirection in the CS domain

Figure A.3.4.2-1 provides the signaling flow for PN UE redirection in
the CS domain. The GMSC will receive the ISUP containing calling party
number and called party number. The gsmSCF will invoke the service logic
in order to route the call to the Default-UE.

Figure A.3.4.2-1: Signalling flow for PN UE redirection in the CS domain

**1. ISUP IAM**

An IAM message arrives at the GMSC\#1. Specifically for this signalling
flow, the IAM includes:

\- Called Party Number parameter = \[(Numbering plan identifier =
ISDN/telephony numbering plan), (type of number = international number),
(Number digits = 12415553333)\]

\- Calling Party Number parameter = \[(Numbering plan identifier =
ISDN/telephony numbering plan), (type of number = international number),
(Number digits = 12125551111)\]

**2. MAP Send Routing Information (SRI) (GMSC\#1 to HSS)**

On receipt of the incoming call request, the GMSC queries the HSS for
routing information.

**3. Retrieval of PNM subscriber information**

The HSS provides information including the T-CSI information element
that contains information configured for the PNM subscriber, identifying
the subscriber as having terminating CAMEL services. The T-CSI IE also
includes the gsmSCF address.

**4. MAP Send Routing Information Acknowledgement (SRI ACK) (HSS to
GMSC\#1)**

The HSS returns the T-CSI information element to the GMSC in response to
the query for routing information (SRI). The GMSC now has the address of
the gsmSCF.

**5. CAMEL IDP (GMSC to gsmSCF)**

The GMSC\#1 triggers a CAMEL activity which results in sending a CAMEL
IDP message to the GSM Service Control Function (gsmSCF). The CAMEL IDP
message contains at least:

\- the calling party number;

\- the called party number;

\- the type of call; and

\- Information from the T-CSI IE received by the GMSC\#1 in the SRI ACK
from the HSS. This includes the CAMEL service key.

**6. The gsmSCF invokes PNM Redirection service logic to route the
call.**

**7. CAMEL CONNECT (gsmSCF to GMSC\#1)**

The CAMEL service function causes the gsmSCF to respond to the CAMEL IDP
message with a CAMEL CONNECT message containing:

\- The MSISDN of the Default UE: 12245678912

**8. IAM message arrived at GMSC\#2 of Default UE.**

The IAM includes:

\- Called Party Number parameter = \[(Numbering plan identifier =
ISDN/telephony numbering plan), (type of number = international number),
(Number digits = 12415553333)\]

\- Calling Party Number parameter = \[(Numbering plan identifier =
ISDN/telephony numbering plan), (type of number = international number),
(Number digits = 12125551111)\]

**9. ISUP IAM**

The call is routed to the Default UE.

**10-12. ISUP ACM**

In response an ACM is generated .There is no PNM specific content to
this response.

**13-15. ISUP ANM**

The ANM is generated after the terminating UE answers the call. There is
no PNM specific content to this response.

A.3.5 Signalling flows for PN access control
--------------------------------------------

### A.3.5.1 PN access control procedure in IM CN subsystem

Figure A.3.5.1-1 details the signalling flows for PN access control in
the IM CN subsystem.

In the following flow UE\#2a is the PN controller UE and UE\#2b is the
PN controllee UE.

The steps prior to step 1 are according to the standard procedures
specified in 3GPP TS 24.228 \[10\].

**1. INVITE\#1 (I-CSCF\#2 to S-CSCF\#2)**

**13. PNM Privacy Decision**

Based upon the IARI value the PN controller UE invokes the PN controller
application. The PN controller application provides the originators
identity from the P-Asserted-Identity header, the PN controllee UE
identity from the target URI-parameter in the Request-URI to the user
and provides the option to the user to either:

1\. Forward the session to the controllee UE

2\. Reject the session

3\. Accept the session

In the example the user determines to forward the sesssion to the
controllee UE.

**19-34. These flows follow the standard session establishment
procedures specified in 3GPP TS 24.228 \[10\].**

### A.3.5.2 PN access control procedure in CS domain.

Figure A.3.5.2-1 provides the signalling flows for the PN access control
procedure in the CS domain. PN access control services deal with a user
having access control over its personal network.

Figure A.3.5.2-1 Signalling flow for PN access control in the CS domain

**1. ISUP IAM**

A Call Request containing an IAM message arrives at the GMSC.

Specifically for this signalling flow, the IAM includes:

\- Calling Party number =12134587692

\- Called Party Number parameter = \[(Numbering plan identifier =
ISDN/telephony numbering plan), (type of number = international number),
(Number digits = 15346789043)\]

**2. MAP Send Routing Information (SRI)**

On receipt of the incoming call request, the GMSC queries the HSS for
routing information.

**3. Retrieval of PNM subscriber information**

The HSS identifies the subscriber as a PNM subscriber and provides the
configured terminated CAMEL subscription information (T-CSI) towards the
GMSC in the SRI-ACK.

**4. MAP Send Routing Information Acknowledgement (SRI ACK)**

The HSS returns the T-CSI information element which includes the gsmSCF
address to the GMSC in response to the query for routing information
(SRI).

**5. CAMEL IDP (GMSC to gsmSCF)**

The GMSC\#1 triggers a CAMEL activity which results in sending a CAMEL
IDP message to the GSM Service Control Function (gsmSCF). The CAMEL IDP
message contains at least:

\- the calling party number;

\- the called party number;

\- the type of call; and

\- information from the T-CSI IE received by the GMSC\#1 in the SRI ACK
from the HSS. This includes the CAMEL service key.

**6. PN access control**

The gsmSCF performs the PN access control. Since the calling party is
not configured in the PN access control list, the gsmSCF needs to ask
the controller UE to grant the access to the calling party.

**7-8. MAP-UNSTRUCTURED-SS-REQUEST (gsmSCF to HSS)**

As part of this process the gsmSCF starts the timer to supervise the
call establishment and sends a MAP-UNSTRUCTURED-SS-REQUEST message to
the HSS. The message contains the following information.

USSD String:- Calling Number 12134587692 and called Number 15346789043.

**9. MAP-UNSTRUCTURED-SS-REQUEST (HSS to MSC/VLR)**

The HSS relays the USSD request message to the MSC/VLR. It contains the
following information.

USSD String:- Calling Number 12134587692 and called Number 15346789043.

**10. REGISTER (MSC/VLR to controller UE)**

> This message is used between MSC/VLR and the UE to get the access
> granted for the incoming call. It contains the following information.

Facility (Invoke=UNSTRUCTURED-SS-REQUEST(USSD-Data-Coding-Scheme, USSD
String))

**11-13.** When the timer expires, the gsmSCF generates a play
announcement message containing Tone ID and Duration parameters as
specified in 3GPP TS 29.078 \[13\].

**14. FACILITY (controller UE to MSC/VLR)**

The controller UE will send the FACILITY message back to the MSC/VLR. It
contains the following information.

Facility (ReturnResult=UNSTRUCTURED-SS-REQUEST (USSD-Data-Coding-Scheme,
USSD String)) which inform that the call is accepted.

**15-16. MAP-UNSTRUCTURED-SS-REQUEST-Ack (MSC/VLR to HSS)**

After receiving the FACILITY message from the controller UE, the MSC/VLR
sends an USSD message towards the gsmSCF via the HSS. It contains the
following information.

Facility (ReturnResult=UNSTRUCTURED-SS-REQUEST(USSD-Data-Coding-Scheme,
USSD String))

**17.** As the user responds, the gsmSCF stops playing the announcement
by sending a DisconnectForwardConnection message to the GMSC.

NOTE: If the user responds before the timer started in step 7 expires,
steps 12, 13 & 17 are skipped.

**18. Call Continue/Release Call (HSS to GMSC)**

Based on the response of the controller UE the gsmSCF sends a CAMEL
CONTINUE or CAMEL RELEASE message to the GMSC.

**19-20. MAP Send Routing Information (SRI)**

On receipt of the call continue message, the GMSC queries again the HSS
for the routing information for the called party but this time with the
parameter Suppress T-CSI.

**21. MAP SRI Ack**

The HSS executes the roaming number enquiry procedure and sends this
information back to the GMSC within the SRI-Ack containing
MSRN=15346787943.

**22. Call setup**

The GMSC starts the normal call setup towards the visited MSC of the
called party to establish the call.

**5. SIP 100 (Trying) response (PNM AS to S-CSCF\#2)**

The PNM AS responds to the INVITE\#1 request with a 100 Trying
provisional response.

There is no PNM specific content to this response.

**6. PNM session redirection service control**

The PNM AS executes the PNM redirection service control logic in order
to route the call to the default UE located in the CS domain.

In this example the MSISDN of the called party is +1237654799942

**7. Steps 7 to 26 are identical to generic session setup procedure
specified in 3GPP TS 24.228 \[10\].**

### A.3.6.2 CS domain to IM CN subsystem

Figure A.3.6-2 shows the signaling flows for inter-domain networking
from CS domain to IM CN subsystem.

Figure A.3.6-2: Inter-domain networking: (CS-IM CN)

**1. ISUP IAM (coming from the originating PLMN through the CS domain)**

In this example, a call request (ISUP IAM) makes an entry from the PLMN
of the originating user (calling party) into the home PLMN of the
terminating user (called party). The first entry point of the PLMN of
the terminating user is the Gateway MSC (GMSC). The call request is a
form of an ISUP IAM (Initial Address Message) and contains the called
party number (MSISDN).

In this example the MSISDN of the called party is +12134567897

**2. MAP Send Routing Information (SRI) (GMSC to HSS)**

On receipt of the incoming call request, the GMSC queries the HSS for
routing information.

**3. Retrieval of PNM subscriber information**

The HSS provides information including the T-CSI information element
that contains information configured for the PNM subscriber, identifying
the subscriber as having terminating CAMEL services. The T-CSI IE also
includes the gsmSCF address.

**4**. **MAP send routing information acknowledgement (SRI ACK) (HSS to
GMSC)**

The HSS returns the T-CSI information element to the GMSC in response to
the query for routing information (SRI). The GMSC now has the address of
the gsmSCF.

**5. CAMEL IDP (GMSC to gsmSCF)**

The GMSC triggers a CAMEL activity which results in sending a CAMEL IDP
message to the GSM service control function (gsmSCF). The CAMEL IDP
message contains at least:

\- the calling party number;

\- the called party number;

\- the type of call; and

\- information from the T-CSI IE received by the GMSC in the SRI ACK
from the HSS. This includes the CAMEL service key.

**6. Reroute to IMS determination**

The gsmSCF invokes PNM redirection service logic to determine whether
the call needs to be rerouted to the default UE located in the IM CN
subsystem for UE redirection.

**7. CAMEL CONNECT (gsmSCF to GMSC)**

The CAMEL service function causes the gsmSCF to respond to the CAMEL IDP
message with a CAMEL CONNECT message containing

MSISDN of default UE: 12134567897

**8. IAM\#2(GMSC to MGCF)**

The GMSC generates the IAM\#2 containing the MSISDN of the default UE at
which the call is to be redirected and signals it to the MGCF.

MSISDN of default UE: 12134567897

**9. SIP INVITE (MGCF to S-CSCF)**

The MGCF interworks the IAM into the appropriate SIP message and
initiates the SIP INVITE request towards the S-CSCF via the intermediate
IM CN subsystem entities.

(MGCF towards the S-CSCF through the intermediate IM CN subsystem
entities) -- see example in table A.3.Y1

######## Annex C (normative): Definitions of the PNM XCAP application usage

XCAP requires an application usage to fulfil a number of steps in the
definition of such application usage. The remainder of this annex
specifies the required definitions of the PNM XCAP application usage.

**Application Unique ID (AUID):** Each XCAP application usage is
associated with a unique name called the Application Unique ID (AUID).
The AUID defined by the PNM application usage falls into the
vendor‑proprietary namespace of XCAP AUID, where 3GPP is considered a
vendor.

The AUID allocated to the PNM XCAP application usage is:

pnm.3gpp.org

**Default namespace:** XCAP requires application usages to declare the
default namespace. The default namespace of the PNM XCAP application
usage is:

http://uri.3gpp.org/params/xml/pnm/xcap

**MIME type:** The MIME type of PNM XML documents is:

application/pnm+xml

**Naming conventions:** By default, a PNM XML document is stored under
the user\'s Home Directory (which is located under the \"users\"
sub‑tree). In order to facilitate the manipulation of a PNM XML
document, the present document defines a default XML file name:

pnm.xml

**XCAP root URI: The XCAP root defines all contexts in which all XCAP
resources defined by the operator (**e.g., an operator with a domain
name of example.com) **exist and t**he corresponding **XCAP root URI**
is:

xcap.example.com

**XCAP User Identify (XUI):** Each user known to the XACP server is
associated with a user name, called XCAP User Identifier (XUI), which is
pre-configured at the PN UE. The XUI for PNM can be the shared public
user identity used of the PN user.

**Validation Constraints:** The \<PNUEName\> child elements of all
\<RedirectedUserID\> and \<RedirectingUserID\> child elements of a
\<UERedirection\> element shall have different values.

The \<PNUEName\> child elements of all \<ControllerUE\> and
\<ControlleeUE\> child elements of an \<AccessControl\> element shall
have different values.

**Data Semantics:** Data semantics are defined above.

**Resource Interdependencies:** There are no resource interdependencies
in this application usage beyond those defined by the schema.

**Authorization Policies:** This application usage does not change the
default authorization policy defined by XCAP.
