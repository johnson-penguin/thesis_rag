Foreword
========

This Technical Specification has been produced by the 3^rd^ Generation
Partnership Project (3GPP).

The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work
within the TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the
TSG modify the contents of the present document, it will be re-released
by the TSG with an identifying change of release date and an increase in
version number as follows:

Version x.y.z

where:

x the first digit:

1 presented to TSG for information;

2 presented to TSG for approval;

3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.

y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e.
technical enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.

z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been
incorporated in the document.

Introduction
============

**(Background)**

The use and general aspects of the A‑bis interface are given in
specification 3GPP TS 48.051. The split of telecommunications functions
and management procedures between BSC and BTS are defined in
specification 3GPP TS 48.052. Specification 3GPP TS 48.056 defines Layer
2 of the signalling messages.

The general aspects of NM are defined in specification GSM 12.00. Qx
interface and protocol stack are defined in specification GSM 12.01. GSM
12.06 provides the functional requirements supported by the present
document. The NM procedures and messages to support these operations
over the A‑bis interface are specified here. Specification GSM 12.20
provides the information model as seen on the OMC-BSC interface.
Interworking between this model and the NM messages and procedures
provided here is specified in GSM 12.22.

1 Scope
=======

The present document addresses the network management messages and
procedures across the A-bis interface, which is defined as Qx in GSM.
The information model included here defines the objects and how they are
addressed for purposes of operations and maintenance activities.

There is a requirement for the A-bis interface to be open to allow
interoperation between BTSs of different manufacturers working to the
same BSC. The present document addresses this requirement from O&M point
of view, which allows this interworking to take place. It shows the
split of NM functions between BSC and BTS. The procedures and coding of
the messages are specified in detail. In practice, in addition to the
present document it is necessary that the content of
manufacturer-dependent information fields be specified to fulfill the
functionality.

It is essential for operation that a BSC can handle the functions used
by all its BTSs. Therefore, all items in the present document are
considered mandatory unless otherwise indicated in the present document.

5 Information Model
===================

5.1 Managed Objects
-------------------

The BCF mentioned in 3GPP TS 48.052 and 3GPP TS 48.056 is the agent at
the BTS end of the A-bis O&M interface. It has four different
descriptions depending on the object that is managed: Site Manager, BTS,
Radio Carrier and Baseband Transceiver.

This model describes how objects are managed across A-bis interface, but
it doesn\'t specify how information is transferred inside the site. That
is, the manner of communication between an object and objects under it
is not specified in the present document.

As shown in Figure 1, the Object Classes used on the A-bis interface are
a subset of those found under Site Manager on the OMC-BSC interface. The
Object Classes are listed below and the functionalities that describe
them are found in table 2.

**Site Manager:** manages common control functions of several BTSs and
transceivers on one site. These can include managing external alarms,
front-end switch, etc. This model describes logical sites. There can be
multiple logical sites in one physical site. Communication between
entities within a logical site is manufacturer dependent.

**BTS:** is associated with one cell. BTSs are typically created at
installation phase by connecting transceivers to antennas thus forming
cells from the air interface point of view. The BTS can also contain
control functions common to various transceivers. The way BTSs are
formed from transceivers and how corresponding BTS numbers are
determined is configuration dependent information, which is stored
during installation.

**Radio Carrier:** represents manageable properties pertaining to radio
transmission and reception of one carrier.

**Baseband Transceiver:** represents functions common to eight radio
time slots.

**Channel:** is a physical channel in air interface, which can contain
several logical channels depending on channel combination. A Channel is
described with radio time slot and frequency hopping attributes (see
3GPP TS 45.002).

NOTE: Site Manager and BTS don\'t necessarily require separate
equipment. For example, the Site Manager and a Baseband Transceiver can
be associated with the same physical equipment.

+---------------+-------------------------+-------------------------+

NOTE: If more than one layer 2 link is defined to handle this
information model, the actual implementation may affect on which layer 2
link attributes concerning frequency hopping and front-end switch are
sent. Equipment used to implement frequency hopping can be common to
several radio carriers or located inside one radio carrier. Front-end
switch is handled by Site Manager, therefore all \'Abis Channel\'
attributes must be sent to it. Those attributes that need a link
identifier in BSC data structures are marked with an asterisk (\*).

5.2 Addressing of Objects
-------------------------

It is a GSM requirement that the BSC is capable of operating with BTSs
from different manufacturers. So, it is necessary that the differences
between BTSs, as seen by the BSC, are minimised as much as possible.
This is achieved by addressing NM messages by the Managed Object Class
and Managed Object Instance. There must be in the BSC an object model
with a complete layer 2 link description for each object instance in the
BTS (e.g., Baseband Transceiver 1, Baseband Transceiver 2, Baseband
Transceiver 3,\...). When a message has to be sent to an object instance
this mapping is used to find the correct link.

The first connection shall be established from the BTS site by using a
(semi‑) permanently programmed default TEI. Subsequent to the
establishment of the default connection to the site, further initial
connections to other objects shall be established using TEIs provided by
procedures in subclause 6.3.1.

Possible additional TEIs to an object already having an initial TEI are
assigned with a GSM 12.21 message found in subclause 6.3.1 through an
already assigned signalling link.

Object instances also have a layer 3 address. The instance number is
used to address the object instance. Regardless of whether the layer 2
address uniquely identifies the object instance or not, the layer 3
address must also be provided so that it can be used by management agent
to determine which object instance is being addressed. This combination
of layer 2 and layer 3 addressing accommodates BTS sites with either
single or multiple physical links.

Specific equipment configuration information is manufacturer dependent.
However, for interoperability, link configuration, default TEI
assignment and instance numbering must be known by both manager and
agent. This, as well as supported functions, is considered as Shared
Management Knowledge.

5.3 State Management of Objects
-------------------------------

State management in the present document is generally in line with ITU-T
Recommendation X.731. How state values are applied is explained below.

ITU-T Recommendation X.731 states that \"the management state of a
managed object represents the instantaneous condition of availability
and operability of the associated resources from the point of view of
management\".

In the present document there are two different factors (ITU-T
Recommendation X.731 defines usage state in addition to these two) that
are considered to affect the management state of a managed object. They
are:

\- administration: permission to use or prohibition against using the
resource, imposed through the management services;

\- operability: whether or not the resource is physically installed and
working.

The present document defines the following three state management
attributes to represent the management state of a managed object:

\- administrative state;

\- operational state;

\- availability status (this elaborates the operational state).

### 5.3.1 Administrative State

Administrative states of the managed objects can be controlled only by
the BSC. In fact, the control of resource usage comes from the MSC).

Setting the administrative state of a Channel to **locked** means that
it has to discontinue all transmission and reception of information on
Air interface and all telecommunication (traffic and signalling)
information transmission on A-bis interface.

Setting the administrative state of a Radio Carrier to **locked** means
that it has to discontinue all RF emission on Air interface for the
frequencies it is responsible.

Setting the administrative state of a Baseband Transceiver to **locked**
means that it has to discontinue all telecommunication tramissions and
the Channels which are affected should indicate that they are Disabled
or Degraded.

Setting the administrative state of a BTS to locked means it has to
discontinue all RF emission on all Radio Carriers and all
telecommunication transmissions on all Channels of all Baseband
Transceivers, i.e., Radio Carriers, Channels and Baseband Transceivers
are in Disabled, Dependency state.

The administrative state at the BTS site is also used to provide
information e.g., for a local MMI user at a BTS site.

The **locked** state of a 12.21 managed object means that BSC has
disconnected all the calls that go through the resource that is
represented by the managed object. No new traffic is connected through
this resource any more.

The **shutting down** state means that no new traffic is connected
through this resource any more. The on‑going calls remain.

The **unlocked** state means that new traffic is allowed through the
resource represented by the managed object.

### 5.3.2 Operational State and Availability Status

ITU-T Recommendation X.731 gives the following definitions for the
values of the operational state attribute:

\- **disabled**: the resource is totally inoperable and unable to
provide service to the user(s);

\- **enabled**: the resource is partially or fully operable and
available for use.

In the present document the value Disabled represents the following
conditions that the resources could have:

\- hardware or software is not installed;

\- power is turned off;

\- failure has occurred;

\- radio parameters has not yet been set by elementary procedures,
therefore, the resource is off line.

The availability status elaborates the operational state attribute. In
the present document the following values are used (availability status
is a set value):

**In test:** the resource is undergoing a test procedure.

**Failed:** the resource has an internal fault that prevents it from
operating. The operational state is *disabled*.

**Power off:** the resource requires power to be applied and is not
powered on. The operational state is *disabled*.

**Off line:** the resource requires some manual and/or automatic
operation(s) to be performed to make it available for the use.

**Dependency:** the resource cannot operate because some other resource
on which it depends is unavailable. The operational state is *disabled*.

**Degraded:** the service available from the resource is degraded in
some respect, such as in speed or operating capacity. The operational
state is *enabled*.

**Not installed:** the hardware or the software associated with the
managed object has not been installed at the site. Operational state is
*disabled*.

Figure 2 illustrates the operational state and availability status
behaviour of GSM 12.21 objects (i.e., Site Manager, BTS, Radio Carrier,
and Baseband Transceiver) during initialization. The initial value of
the administrative state is *locked*.

and availability status behaviour during initialization

6 Elementary Procedures
=======================

The operational procedures applicable to the BTS consist of bringing BTS
equipment and software into (or taking them out of) service, initiation
of tests at the BTS, collection of test results made at the BTS,
reporting and clearing of any BTS faults, and reporting of any BTS
external alarms. Bringing into service of equipment at the BTS will
include manual operations, including turning the switch on, and
performing local testing where relevant at the BTS, followed by an
indication of the availability of the equipment to the BTS via some
man-machine interface (MMI terminal, telephone). It is then a BSC
function to ensure that relevant data on the existence of the equipment
is resident at the BTS, and to activate (bring into service) the new
equipment. Manual procedures may also be employed for software loading,
at least initially.

As far as software is concerned, all operational software used at the
BTS shall also be kept at the BSC, and can be downloaded from the BSC.
At the BTS there may be either single instance of the software, or there
may also be back-up versions.

6.1 Definition of the Procedures
--------------------------------

All the procedures covered in the present document are based on
formatted O&M messages. Most formatted O&M messages initiated by the BSC
(or by a BTS) will receive a response or acknowledgement at Layer 3. A
pair of such messages, or single message if a response is not required,
is referred to as an elementary procedure. All messages shall be sent
using I frames at Layer 2.

A number of procedures, referred to as structured procedures (see GSM
12.22), are based on a multiplicity of elementary procedures. Some
structured procedures may also involve MMI messages, but these are not
defined in the present document. For all elementary procedures described
in Subclauses 6.2 through 6.10, the protocol scenarios are illustrated
with no further explicit reference made from their corresponding
subclauses because of their self-explanatory nature.

Descriptions of the messages and the direction of transmission are given
in the following subclauses.

No elementary procedure shall be initiated to an object instance which
has not yet replied to a previously initiated elementary procedure with
a response, an ACK or a NACK within a layer 3 time-out. The layer 3
timeout for ACK, NACK and responses shall have a default value of 10
seconds.

An ACK message is returned to inform the application which initialized
the message that the command is performed or will be performed.

The whole message must be rejected if there is something not
understood/supported in the original message.

A NACK may not be relevant for some elementary procedures.

The most relevant Nack causes, not covered by the general causes (which
are used for understanding of header fields), are given for each
elementary procedure with reference to the coding of the Nack causes in
subclause 9.4.36.

The general Nack causes are relevant for any Nack message and are also
found in subclause 9.4.36.

6.2 SW Download Management Procedures
-------------------------------------

### 6.2.1 Load Data Initiate

This message shall be sent from the BSC to the BTS to initiate the
loading of a file. It indicates the number of segments for which a Layer
3 acknowledgement is required (window size). When receiving data the BTS
shall send an ACK after this number of segments, except for the last
batch.

BSC BTS

Meaning of Ack message : Ready to receive the specified file.

Message specific Nack causes (see subclause 9.4.36): 23, 24.

### 6.2.2 Load Data Segment

These multi-segment messages shall be used to carry the files for the
transfer initiated by the Load Data Initiate message. No other file
transfer shall be allowed until the current transfer is finished.

etc.

etc.

An ACK shall be sent from the BTS to the BSC every time when *Window
Size* number of segments specified in the Load Data Initiate message are
downloaded. A reception of an ACK must not reset the value of the
*sequence number* of the subsequent message segments (see subclause
8.1.1). When all the expected blocks have been received, an ACK must be
sent regardless of the window size. If the timer for a time-out for the
Layer 3 acknowledgement expires, the BSC shall send a Load Data Abort
message and the file transfer shall be aborted.

Meaning of Ack message: A window of Load data segment messages or a
complete file has been received.

### 6.2.3 Load Data Abort

This message shall be used by either end if the file transfer can no
longer be supported. This message shall also be used by the BTS if the
received amount of data exceeds the expected amount.

BSC BTS

Meaning of Ack message : File download is successfully terminated.

Message specific Nack causes (see subclause 9.4.36): 25.

### 6.2.5 SW Activate Request

This message shall be sent by the BTS when the resource represented by
the object instance (Site Manager, BTS, Radio Carrier, or Baseband
Transceiver) has started up. The initialization of mentioned object
instance shall be started with software activation, which may include
software download continuing with attribute setting.

Meaning of Ack message : The request is granted and software activation
will be commenced.

Message specific Nack causes (see subclause 9.4.36): None.

### 6.2.6 Activate SW

This message from the BSC to the BTS shall be used to activate the
loaded software, indicating which file (or files) is to be activated.
The acknowledgement of the Activate SW indicates that the software can
be activated. If the software cannot be activated, a NACK must be sent.
The activation may include BTS internal software distribution.

BSC BTS

Activate SW

\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\--\>

Message specific Nack causes (see subclause 9.4.36): 23, 26, 27.

### 6.2.7 SW Activated Report

This message from the BTS to the BSC shall be sent from the addressed
object on the BTS at a successful completion of the software
distribution to and activation on all indicated destinations in the BTS.

BSC BTS

SW Activated Report

\<\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\--

6.3 A‑bis Interface Management Procedures
-----------------------------------------

These procedures (excluding \'Establish TEI\') are only relevant with
BTSs having flexibility to configure A-bis channels to different
Baseband Transceivers. This configuration flexibility is realized with
equipment that can be called BTS front-end switch. In other words this
switch allows an A-bis channel to be able to be connected in several
possibilities.

There must be a default connection to the Site Manager, which manages
the front-end switch. The default connection information (AbisLink, TEI)
must be (semi-)permanently programmable so that it is available at power
up. Through the default connection other A-bis connections are
established by configuring the front-end switch.

It is optional for BTS equipment to have front-end switch features.

### 6.3.1 Establish TEI

When an initial/additional TEI is to be established (see 3GPP TS
48.056), this message shall be sent from the BSC on a previously
established link giving initial/additional TEI number and the
corresponding physical connection. For establishment of additional TEI
the procedure specified in specification 3GPP TS 48.056 must be
performed and the result shall be indicated in the ACK/NACK response
message. If an initial TEI assignment fails, it can mean that TEIs
cannot be assigned through the default link (e.g., physical
implementation doesn\'t support transferring TEIs from Site Manager to
Baseband Transceivers). In that case there must be subsequent
preprogrammed TEIs to establish more links.

BSC BTS

Establish TEI

\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\--\>

ACK/NACK

\<\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\--

6.6 Test Management Procedures
------------------------------

### 6.6.1 Perform Test

This message shall be used to tell the BTS to perform a test, if
necessary to set a physical configuration for the BSC to carry out a
test on the BTS, or to perform a test using a particular configuration.
Any measurements may be performed as specific tests. Duration for the
test can be given, after which the test report may be autonomously sent
if so requested.

Three tests are defined.

1\) A radio loop test via the antenna shall be used to test all
equipment needed to provide service of one traffic channel. The loop
starts and ends in the transceiver baseband parts and loops one traffic
channel back in the air interface i.e., using actual antenna equipment.
The baseband parts of the transceiver calculate the bit error rate to
describe the quality of service that channel provides.

2\) A radio loop test via the transceiver shall be used to test most of
the equipment needed to provide service of one traffic channel. The loop
starts and ends in the transceiver baseband parts and loops one traffic
channel back inside the transceiver before the antenna combining
equipment. The baseband parts of the transceiver calculate the bit error
rate to describe the quality of service that channel provides. This test
can be used in conjunction with the previous test to discriminate the
location of a possible hardware failure.

3\) A functional object self test shall be used to activate an internal
self test procedure of a functional object on the BTS made to test
equipment that provides the services of the functional object. By its
nature this test and its results are proprietary.

BSC BTS

### 6.6.2 Test Report

This message shall be sent by the BTS giving the result of a test
ordered by the BSC and is sent autonomously as soon as the result is
available. A *Test Report* shall also be sent after a specific request
from the BSC by a *Send Test Report* message. The *Test Report*
indicates what was tested, the test type, and the result. No Ack or Nack
is returned to the BTS.

BSC BTS

### 6.6.3 Send Test Report

This message shall be sent from the BSC to ask for the result/report of
a test which was not to be sent autonomously now to be started being
reported. If the test result was already made to be autonomously
reported, this message can also be used to have the present result of
the test be reported immediately. The message must include
identification of the test.

BSC BTS

Send Test Report

test at the BTS, to reset a physical test configuration to the normal
configuration, or to stop the test and to restore to the normal physical
configuration. The message must include identification of the test being
performed.

BSC BTS

6.7 State Management and Event Report Procedures
------------------------------------------------

### 6.7.1 State Changed Event Report

An unsolicited report shall be sent from the BTS to the BSC whenever a
change of the operational state or of the optional manufacturer
dependent state of a managed object defined in the present document
occurs. The message shall be also sent when any site input changes its
state.

A failure, causing change of operational state, shall generate two event
reports: *State Changed Event Report* and *Failure Event Report*.

No Ack or Nack is returned to the BTS.

BSC BTS

State Changed Event Report

\<\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\--

### 6.7.2 Failure Event Report

An unsolicited report shall be sent from the BTS to the BSC whenever
failure events occur in the BTS.

Such failure events are:

\- fault in a resource resulting from passing a threshold but not
constituting a failure;

\- failure of a resource.

Pertaining to a failure, there shall be a report for its start and
another for its cease.

A failure causing change of operational state shall generate two event
reports: *State Changed Event Report* and *Failure Event Report*.

No Ack or Nack is returned to the BTS.

BSC BTS

Failure Event Report

\<\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\--

### 6.7.3 Stop Sending Event Reports

This inhibition of sending of event reports shall be used by the BSC to
prevent a flood of event reports which are of no benefit to the BSC. One
example of this occurs at a BTS restart following a power failure. The
operational capability of the BTS hardware is unlikely to be different
from what it was before the failure, and a flood of reports, each
stating that a piece of hardware is operating, will delay the software
download. Another example concerns the case of a frequently occurring
transient fault.

administrative state message will be sent.

Message specific Nack causes (see subclause 9.4.36): 28, 29.

### 6.7.7 Report Outstanding Alarms

This message shall be used by the BSC to ask BTS to report all
outstanding alarms related to the object instance indicated in the
message. The BTS shall report alarms by sending a series of *Failure
Event Report* messages for all outstanding alarms. Only those alarms
previously reported and still outstanding shall be re-reported through
this procedure. Any new alarms not yet reported but about to be reported
shall be excluded and they shall be reported through a separate *Failure
Event Report* procedure spontaneously initiated by the BTS itself. If
there is no outstanding alarm, the BTS shall reply with a NACK with that
cause indicated.

BSC BTS

performed.

Message specific Nack causes (see subclause 9.4.36): 19, 1A, 1E, 23.

### 6.8.2 Opstart

This message shall be sent by the BSC to tell the BTS to attempt to
operatethe identified object putting it to an initial normal operational
state (i.e., \"enabled\", see subclause 5.3.2). This message does not
affect the object\'s administrative state if there exists a value
explicitly assigned by the BSC. If there is yet no administrative state
value explicitly set by the BSC (e.g., at an initialization time), the
object shall be presumed to be administratively locked by default. No
BTS function is required to be responsible for testing the operability
of the identified resource as a consequence of this message. Prior to
this message being issued, all necessary physical and logical
preparations (such as repair of equipment, software downloading,
parameter setting, etc., as needed) are expected to have been completed.
If the object is in fact not ready to be in an enabled state, the object
will be in a fault condition as a consequence of this message, and the
condition shall be handled by the object\'s normal fault handling
function as the condition is detected.

### 6.8.3 Reinitialize

This message shall be sent by the BSC to tell the BTS to have specified
hardware resource of the indicated object start a re-initialization
procedure as sketched in figure 2. The specifics of a re-initialization
procedure, which typically takes place at the time of a cold start of
the resource, is manufacturer-dependent. For a software
reinitialization, *Activate SW* message shall be used.

7 Structured Procedures
=======================

Applicable structured A-bis procedures are described in GSM 12.22.

8 Message Details
=================

The formats of all messages in subclauses 8.3 through 8.11 are described
each by a table format illustration with no formal text description
provided because of the self-explanatory nature of the illustration.

8.1 Message Categories
----------------------

This subclause defines the transport format and coding of the four
Network. Management message categories sent over the Abis interface. The
various message categories may be sent in either direction. In each
message, the message discriminator identifies the category and is
transmitted first. In a message the octets must be sent in the order
shown in the description of the messages. In an octet, bit 1 must be
transmitted first.

In the following subclauses, M and O denote whether information elements
are mandatory or optional.

### 8.1.1 Formatted O&M Messages

The message format and coding of these messages are as below.

+-----------------------+-----+--------+-----------------+
| INFORMATION ELEMENT   | M/O | LENGTH | CODING          |
|                       |     |        |                 |
|                       |     |        | 8 1             |
+-----------------------+-----+--------+-----------------+
| Message Discriminator | M   | 1      | 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 |
+-----------------------+-----+--------+-----------------+
| Placement Indicator   | M   | 1      | 1\)             |
+-----------------------+-----+--------+-----------------+
| Sequence Number       | M   | 1      | 2\)             |
+-----------------------+-----+--------+-----------------+
| Length Indicator      | M   | 1      | Binary, 3)      |
+-----------------------+-----+--------+-----------------+
| O&M Data Field        | M   | V      | 4\)             |
+-----------------------+-----+--------+-----------------+

NOTE 1: The meanings and codings of the Placement Indicator are:

\- only: This message is contained within one segment 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0;

\- first: The first segment of a multi-segment message 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0;

\- middle: A middle segment of a multi-segment message 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0;

\- last: The last segment of a multi-segment message 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0.

NOTE 2: This is the sequence number of the segment in the message,
modulo 256, starting with 00000000. Thus a single segment message is
here coded 00000000. The number can be incremented unlimitedly being
wrapped around the modulo to transport very long multi-segment messages.

NOTE 3: The Length Indicator gives the length of the O&M data field in
the message segment being transported which is less than or equal to 255
octets. This length indicator should not be confused with the actual
length of the message at the logical level that may go over multiple
segments. This length indicator should not be confused also with
attribute value length indicator described in subclause 8.2.

NOTE 4: Coding for O&M Data field is found in subclause 8.2 and the
following subclauses.

### 8.1.2 MMI Transfer

The message format and coding of these messages are as below.

+-----------------------+-----+--------+---------------------------+
| INFORMATION ELEMENT   | M/O | LENGTH | CODING                    |
|                       |     |        |                           |
|                       |     |        | 8 1                       |

| Length Indicator      | M   | 1      | Binary, 1)                |
+-----------------------+-----+--------+---------------------------+
| MMI Data Field        | M   | V      | Proprietary               |
+-----------------------+-----+--------+---------------------------+

NOTE: The Length Indicator gives the length of the MMI data field in the
message segment being transported which is less than or equal to 255
octets. See also note 3 of subclause 8.1.1.

The protocol for MMI is not covered in the present document.

### 8.1.3 TRAU O&M Messages

These messages are required for option (ii) of subclause 4.10.1 of
specification GSM 08.60. The message format is as below.

+-----------------------+-----+--------+-----------------+
| INFORMATION ELEMENT   | M/O | LENGTH | CODING          |
|                       |     |        |                 |
|                       |     |        | 8 1             |
+-----------------------+-----+--------+-----------------+
| Message Discriminator | M   | 1      | 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 |
+-----------------------+-----+--------+-----------------+
| Channel Number        | M   | 1      | 1\)             |
+-----------------------+-----+--------+-----------------+
| Repetition Indicator  | M   | 1      | 2\)             |
+-----------------------+-----+--------+-----------------+
| TRAU O&M Message      | O   | 33     | 3\)             |
+-----------------------+-----+--------+-----------------+

NOTE 1: The channel number element shall be coded as defined for the
octet of the channel number information element of specification 3GPP TS
48.058.

NOTE 2: The meanings and codings of the Repetition Indicator are:

\- terminate sending of O&M TRAU frames: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1;

\- repeat sending of O&M TRAU frames every 20 ms until a terminate order
is received 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0;

\- send O&M TRAU frame once: 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0.

NOTE 3: The TRAU O&M message is not sent when the Repetition Indicator
is set to 00000001, but sending of the TRAU O&M message is mandatory
otherwise. All 264 bits of the TRAU O&M frame information field are sent
unchanged in the 33 octets.

### 8.1.4 Manufacturer-Defined O&M messages

The message format and coding of these messages is as below.

+------------------------+-----+--------+---------------------------+
| INFORMATION ELEMENT    | M/O | LENGTH | CODING                    |
|                        |     |        |                           |

+------------------------+-----+--------+---------------------------+
| Man-Def O&M Data Field | M   | V      | Proprietary               |
+------------------------+-----+--------+---------------------------+

NOTE 1: The Length Indicator gives the length of the
Manufacturer-defined O&M data field in the message segment being
transported which is less than or equal to 255 octets. See also note 3
of subclause 8.1.1

NOTE 2: The Length Indicator gives the length of the Manufacturer
Identifier field which must be less than or equal to 255 octets.

NOTE 3: The Manufacturer Identifier is an octet string of maximally 255
octets. This value, to be appropriately determined by an arrangement
between the operator and the manufacturer, may or may not be related to
the value of the attribute *Manufacturer Id* (Attribute Id: 1E) listed
in subclause 9.4.

Remarks: Since the Data Field of messages of this category is not
subject to a GSM standardization, it should be noted that a compliance
to messages of this category does not guarrantee an interoperability
between different manufacturers.

8.2 Structure of Formatted O&M Messages
---------------------------------------

This subclause provides details of all the formatted O&M messages.

In every case when particular header octets provide no usable
information at the receiver, they shall be coded all 1\'s.

All fields in the messages are marked with M for Mandatory or O for
Optional. This indicates whether the field is mandatory or optional to
be contained in a message, and **not** whether it is mandatory or
optional to be used or set for every BTS. This allows to change a single
attribute without having to repeat all the attributes not to be changed.

The header fields of formatted O&M messages (see below) are always
mandatory. The attributes defined for a certain message supported by the
BTS implementation are mandatory to be used if not stated otherwise in
an explanatory note.

The first octet of the formatted O&M messages shall identify the message
types. Some messages are replied by an ACK or a NACK response. The
replies shall be distinguished by different codings of the message type
(the first octet of formatted O&M messages). See subclause 9.1.

ACK messages shall return all the attributes in the original message.
NACK messages shall add a *Nack cause* field (two octets) at the end of
the message.

None of the messages concerned requires all of the capacity available in
a Layer 2 segment, so the NACK message will not need a second Layer 2
frame.

An ACK to a number of *Load Data* *Segments* shall consist of only the
header with the \'Load Data Segment Ack\' message type.

All attributes shall overwrite those defined in an earlier message since
start-up or the last restart. Optional attributes provide new
information if they have not been defined in an earlier message.

The message type and managed object identification are given in the
message header as is illustrated below:

  --------------------- ----------- ---------- -------- --------
  INFORMATION ELEMENT   REFERENCE   PRESENCE   FORMAT   LENGTH
  Message Type          9.1         M          V        1
  Object Class          9.2         M          V        1
  Object Instance       9.3         M          V        3
  --------------------- ----------- ---------- -------- --------

The Object Class information element shall be filled in with the correct
information in accordance with the present document.

The Object Instance information element shall contain three fields:

1\) the BTS Number identifies one BTS in a multi cell site;

2\) the Baseband Transceiver number or the Radio Carrier number
identifies which Baseband Transceiver or Radio Carrier is concerned in
the message;

3\) the third element identifies a radio timeslot (0-7) of the Baseband
Transceiver identified by 2).

For further information see subclause 9.3.

The FORMAT field describes the structure of each information element
using T(Tag), L(Length) and V(Value) coding. *T* is the attribute
identifier. *V* is the actual information presented. *L* must be
indicated if the the information element is of variable length and its
prediction is not possible in the context . L shall binary-represent in
a two octet space the the number of octets in the remaining part of
information element. Note that this Length code differs from the
\"Length Indicator\" described in subclause 8.1.

NOTE 1: Stop sending event reports concerning events with any of the
parameter values in this attribute list. Depending on the type of event
report that shall be stopped, one or some of the attributes shall be
sent. The effect of multiple optional attributes in one message is that
only those events that satisfy all the attributes simultaneously shall
stop. The effect of repeated uses of this message with each different
optional attribute is accumulative, thus, is different from the effect
of putting all the optional attributes listed together at once in one
message. If there occurs any inconsistency or confusion between the
conditions for stopping and starting (see subclause 8.8.4), the event
shall be reported instead of being stopped.

NOTE 2: This message with no optional attributes means that all event
reports shall be stopped from now.

report that needs to be restarted, one or some of the attributes shall

multiple messages repeated with each attribute one by one and events
that satisfy any one of the attribute set shall be reported. Note the
difference from the condition stated in note 1 of subclause 8.8.3.

9 Coding
========

This clause defines the coding of each field in the messages defined in
earlier clauses.

The following conventions are required:

\- the least significant bit shall be transmitted first, followed by
bits 2, 3, 4, etc;

\- in an element where octets are identified by an octer number, Octet 1
shall be transmitted first, then octet 2, etc;

\- when a field extends over more than one octet, the order of bit
values shall progressively decrease as the octet number increases. The
least significant bit of the field shall be represented by the lowest
numbered bit of the highest numbered octet of the field;

\- for unpredictable variable length elements, a length indication
coding method defined in subclause 8.2 shall be used. Always the length
information shall indicate the number of element units (which is octets)
following the length indicator excluding the space for the length
findicator itself;

\- all defined values are indicated in the present document. Other
values are reserved.

9.1 Message Type
----------------

The Message Type is coded with 1 octet as illustrated below.

9.2 Object Class
----------------

An Object Class shall be coded with 1 octet. The values of the object
class code are as defined below.

  -------------- ---
  Object Class   1
  -------------- ---

Object Class hexadecimal code

Site Manager 00

BTS 01

Radio Carrier 02

Baseband Transceiver 04

Channel 03

\<reserved for future use\> \<05-FE\>

NULL FF

9.3 Object Instance
-------------------

The Object Instance shall be coded with 3 octets, addressing the
specific object of the given object class as illustrated below.

  ------------------------------------------------ ---
  BTS number                                       1
  Baseband Transceiver *or* Radio Carrier number   2
  Radio Timeslot number                            3
  ------------------------------------------------ ---

All 3 octets are mandatory in the header of every message.

The BTS number distinguishes BTSs which are unique for each cells at a
site under the Site Manager.

The Baseband Transceiver *or* Radio Carrier number distinguishes either
Baseband Transceivers or Radio Carriers under the BTS.

The Radio Timeslot number distinguishes channels under the Baseband
Transceiver.

When the object class is *Site Manager*, all three octets shall be
NULLs, because there is only one Site Manager, which doesn\'t need an
identifier.

When the object class is *BTS*, octet 1 shall be a binary presentation
of the identifier of the addressed BTS. Octets 2 and 3 shall be coded
NULLs. If the BTS number is NULL, it shall be understood as referring to
all BTSs under the Site Manager.

When the object class is *Baseband Transceiver* or *Radio Carrier*,
octet 2 shall be a binary presentation of the identifier of the
addressed Baseband Transceiver or Radio Carrier object, and octet 1 is
the identiferrof the BTS above it. Octet 3 is coded NULL. If the
Baseband Transceiver or Radio Carrier number is NULL, it shall be
understood as referring to all instances of the class under the BTS.

When the object class is *Channel*, octet 3 shall be a binary
presentation of the identifier of the addressed radio timeslot, octet 2
shall be the identifier of the Baseband Transceiver, and octet 1 shall
be the identifer of the BTS above the addressed Channel. If the radio
timeslot number is NULL, it shall be understood as referring to all
Channels under the Baseband Transceiver.

To avoid unnecessary complexity of BTS implementation, it shall not be
allowed to assign a NULL value to any object above the addressed object
class. For example, if the addressed object class is the Baseband
Transceiver, it is not allowed to assign a NULL value to both BTS and
Baseband Transceiver instances (without this constraint, this could be
understood as referring to all the Baseband Transceivers of all the
BTSs).

The value for NULL shall be \<FF\> in all the cases mentioned above in
this subclause.

9.4 Attributes and Parameters
-----------------------------

The Attribute Identifier is coded with 1 octet. The number of parameters
within an attribute is at least one. The length of the parameters within
an attribute will vary. The attributes used and the coding of their
Attribute Identifier fields are listed below. The values are in
hexadecimal. The attributes marked with an X in \"Get\" column are only
*get*able by the BSC, and BSC is not permitted to alter their values.

  (cont.)                                      N
  -------------------------------------------- -----

The BTS shall make a best effort to report on all the attributes
requested by the associated *Get Attributes* message. The *Length*
indicates the length of the entire *Get Attribute Response Info* which
may possibly go over a single segment message and should not be confused
with the length of the data put in one single message frame (see
subclause 8.1.1). The *Count of not reported attributes* entry shall
indicate the binary integer coded value of the count of the attributes
requested but the BTS could not report on because the attributes are
either not supported or not yet defined. In case of a non-zero value of
the above counter, the *Each not- reported attribute id* entry shall
list the Id of each attrute not reported and shall continue as many as
indicated by the above counter. The *Each reported attribute id and its
value* entry shall list each reported attribute id and its value pair
coded and formatted for every applicable attribute or parameter as
specified in this subclause (subclause 9.4) and shall continue until all
reported attributes are included in the response.

### 9.4.65 Outstanding Alarm Sequence

  ---------------------- ---

The integer coded *Pending Reports* field indicates the number of
pending *Failure Event Report* messages to follow the current message as
a response to the associated *Report Outstanding Alarms* message. This
value being 0 signals that it is the last message for the outstanding
alarms.

### 9.4.66 HW Conf Change Info

  ---------------------------------------- -----
  Attribute Identifier                     1
  Length                                   2-3
  HW Description Position Index 1          4
  Operation Code 1                         5
  Modification Data 1 *(only if needed)*   
  \...\...                                 
  HW Description Position Index K          
  Operation Code K                         
  Modification Data K *(only if needed)*   N
  ---------------------------------------- -----

*HW Description Position Index*, *Operation Code*, and *Modification
Data* constitute an associated tripplet for each HW Description change
operation. The triplet may be repeated as many as needed. All the
changes indicated in one *Change HW Configuration* message must be
successfully conducted or the procedure must fail otherwise. The *HW
Description Position Index*, an octet coded integer, indicates the HW
Description\'s position in the HW Configuration attribute to which the
change operation indicated by the associated *Operation Code* must be
applied. In case of multiple entries, all the position indices shall be
interpreted against the initial HW Configuration sequence. There are
three possible operations as listed below:

deletion 00

insertion 01

modification 02

By a deletion operation, the indexed HW Description is deleted from the
HW Configuration attribute. A deletion operation requires no associated
Modification Data. An insertion or modification operation requires an
associated *Modification Data* which specifies the new data for the
operation. By a modification operation, the indexed HW Description in
the HW Configuration attribute is replaced with the provided
Modification Data. Deletion and modification operations are mutually
exclusive at one position. By an insertion operation, the provided
Modification Data is inserted immediately after the indexed HW
Description in the HW Configuration attribute. An insertion at a
position indexed zero (0) is interpreted as prepending to the very
beginning. More than one insertion operation at one identically indexed
position shall produce a HW Configuration sequence in which the inserted
Descriptions are ordered the way as they appear in the *HW Conf Change
Info* field.
