Foreword
========

This Technical Specification has been produced by the 3^rd^ Generation
Partnership Project (3GPP).

The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work
within the TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the
TSG modify the contents of the present document, it will be re-released
by the TSG with an identifying change of release date and an increase in
version number as follows:

Version x.y.z

where:

x the first digit:

1 presented to TSG for information;

2 presented to TSG for approval;

3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.

y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e.
technical enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.

z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been
incorporated in the document.

Introduction
============

The present document is part of a TS-family covering the 3^rd^
Generation Partnership Project; Technical Specification Group Services
and System Aspects; Telecommunication management; as identified below:

**28.651 UTRAN Network Resource Model (NRM) Integration Reference Point
(IRP); Requirements**

**28.652 UTRAN Network Resource Model (NRM) Integration Reference Point
(IRP): Information Service (IS)**

**28.653 UTRAN Network Resource Model (NRM) Integration Reference Point
(IRP); Solution Set (SS) definitions**

1 Scope
=======

The present document defines, in addition to the requirements defined in
\[1\], \[2\] and \[3\], the requirements for the present IRP: Universal
Terrestrial Radio Access Network (UTRAN) Network Resource Model (NRM).

purposes, including management of converged networks.

\- Is a member of the Federated Network Information Model (FNIM) \[4\]
and its information is derived from FNIM Umbrella Information Model
(UIM) \[5\].

In addition, the following more specific requirements apply:

**REQ-UTRAN\_NRM-CON-001:** The NRM defined by this IRP shall contain
UTRAN specific IOCs and related definitions, supporting UTRAN network
entities, which shall include FDD and TDD mode aspects.

**REQ-UTRAN\_NRM-CON-002:** The NRM defined by this IRP shall support
management of UMTS-GSM inter-system handover.

**REQ-UTRAN\_NRM-CON-003:** The NRM defined by this IRP shall support
the management of shared UTRAN.
