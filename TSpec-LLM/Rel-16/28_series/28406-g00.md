 Foreword
========

This Technical Specification has been produced by the 3rd Generation
Partnership Project (3GPP).

The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work
within the TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the
TSG modify the contents of the present document, it will be re-released
by the TSG with an identifying change of release date and an increase in
version number as follows:

Version x.y.z

where:

x the first digit:

1 presented to TSG for information;

2 presented to TSG for approval;

3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.

y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e.
technical enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.

z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been
incorporated in the document.

In the present document, modal verbs have the following meanings:

**shall** indicates a mandatory requirement to do something

**shall not** indicates an interdiction (prohibition) to do something

The constructions \"shall\" and \"shall not\" are confined to the
context of normative provisions, and do not appear in Technical Reports.

The constructions \"must\" and \"must not\" are not used as substitutes
for \"shall\" and \"shall not\". Their use is avoided insofar as
possible, and they are not used in a normative context except in a
direct citation from an external, referenced, non-3GPP document, or so
as to maintain continuity of style when extending or modifying the
provisions of such a referenced document.

**should** indicates a recommendation to do something

**should not** indicates a recommendation not to do something

**may** indicates permission to do something

**need not** indicates permission not to do something

The construction \"may not\" is ambiguous and is not used in normative
elements. The unambiguous constructions \"might not\" or \"shall not\"
are used instead, depending upon the meaning intended.

**can** indicates that something is possible

**cannot** indicates that something is impossible

The constructions \"can\" and \"cannot\" are not substitutes for \"may\"
and \"need not\".

**will** indicates that something is certain or expected to happen as a
result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside
the scope of the present document

**will not** indicates that something is certain or expected not to
happen as a result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which
is outside the scope of the present document

**might** indicates a likelihood that something will happen as a result
of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document

**might not** indicates a likelihood that something will not happen as a
result of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside
the scope of the present document

In addition:

**is** (or any other verb in the indicative mood) indicates a statement
of fact

**is not** (or any other negative verb in the indicative mood) indicates
a statement of fact

The constructions \"is\" and \"is not\" do not indicate requirements.

Introduction
============

The present document is part of a TS-family covering the 3^rd^
Generation Partnership Project; Technical Specification Group Services
and System Aspects; Telecommunication management, as identified below:

TS 28.404: \"Quality of Experience (QoE) measurement collection;
Concepts, use cases and requirements\";

TS 28.405: \"Quality of Experience (QoE) measurement collection; Control
and configuration\";

**TS 28.406: \"Quality of Experience (QoE) measurement collection;
Information definition and transport\".**

One main motivation of the mobile network evolution is to improve the
user experience, which is why the evaluation of the user experience? at
the UE side is vital to network operators. This is especially true when
the operators provide high bit rate real-time services like streaming
services (typically video services), where even intermittent quality
degradation is very annoying. Many of these streaming services are a
significant part of the commercial traffic growth rate, therefore the
focus is on the end users\' experience.

Quality of Experience (QoE) information collection provides detailed
information at session level on a number of UEs.

The capability to log information within a UE, and in particular the QoE
of an end user service, initiated by an operator, provides the operator
with QoE information. The collected information (specified in
3GPP TS 26.247 \[7\]) cannot be deduced from performance measurements in
the mobile network.

The QoE information is information collected by the end user application
in the UE.

The QoE information is collected by the management system for analysis
and/or KPI calculations.

 1 Scope
=======

The present document describes Quality of Experience (QoE) measurement
collection record content definition and management. It covers the
Quality of Experience (QoE) measurement data content, their format and
transfer across UMTS networks and LTE networks. The measurements that
are collected are DASH \[7\] and MTSI \[8\] measurements.

this text, constitute provisions of the present document.

\- References are either specific (identified by date of publication,
edition number, version number, etc.) or non‑specific.

\- For a specific reference, subsequent revisions do not apply.

\- For a non-specific reference, the latest version applies. In the case

----------------------------

### 4.2.1 QoE Metric Definitions 

#### 4.2.1.1 Introduction

This clause provides the general QoE metric definitions and measurement
framework.

The semantics are defined using an abstract syntax. Items in this
abstract syntax have one of the following primitive types (Integer,
Real, Boolean, Enum, String) or one of the following compound types:

\- Objects: an unordered sequence of (key, value) pairs, where the key
always has string type and is unique within the sequence.

\- List: an ordered list of items.

\- Set: an unordered set of items.

Additionally, there are two kinds of timestamp defined, i.e. *real time*
(wall-clock time) and *media time*.

#### 4.2.1.2 Representation Switch Events

Clause 10.2.3 in TS 26.247 \[7\] defines the metrics for representation
switch events.

#### 4.2.1.3 Average Throughput

Clause 10.2.4 in TS 26.247 \[7\] defines the metric for average
throughput.

#### 4.2.1.4 Initial Playout Delay

Clause 10.2.5 in TS 26.247 \[7\] defines the metric for initial playout
delay.

#### 4.2.1.5 Buffer Level

Clause 10.2.6 in TS 26.247 \[7\] defines the metrics for buffer level
status events.

#### 4.2.1.6 Play List

Clause 10.2.7 in TS 26.247 \[7\] defines the metric for play list.

#### 4.2.1.7 MPD Information

Clause 10.2.8 in TS 26.247 \[7\] defines the metric for MPD information.

#### 4.2.1.8 Playout Delay for Media Start-up

Clause 10.2.9 in TS 26.247 \[7\] defines the metric for playout delay
for Media Start-up.

#### 4.2.1.9 Device information

\- Buffer Level (Clause 4.2.1.5),

\- Play List (Clause 4.2.1.6), and

\- Device information (Clause 4.2.1.9).

### 4.2.3 Quality Metrics for DASH

The following metrics shall be supported by 3GP-DASH clients supporting
the QoE reporting feature:

\- List of Representation Switch Events (Clause 4.2.1.2).

\- Average Throughput (Clause 4.2.1.3).
