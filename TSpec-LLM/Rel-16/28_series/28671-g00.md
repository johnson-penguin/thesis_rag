4 Concepts and background 
=========================

HNB Subsystem is defined in TS 23.060 \[6\]. According to the
definition, a HNB subsystem consists of a HNB and a HNB GW. The HNB
Subsystem appears as an RNS to the core network and is connected by
means of the Iu-CS interface to the MSC and by means of the Iu-PS
interface to the SGSN.

Detailed functions of HNB and HNB GW are described in TS 25.467 \[7\].
To be more specific, HNB is a Customer Premise Equipment that offers the
Uu Interface to the UE. It provides RAN connectivity and supports RNC
like functions as well as UE registration over Iuh. HNB Gateway (HNB-GW)
terminates Iuh from HNB and appears as an RNC to the existing Core
network using existing Iu interface. It supports HNB registration and UE
registration over Iuh.

Based on the above characteristics, this specification defines
respective HNS NRM IRP requirements.

5 Requirements
==============

The following general and high-level requirements apply for the present
IRP:

a\) IRP-related requirements in 3GPP TS 32.101 \[2\].

b\) IRP-related requirements in 3GPP TS 32.102 \[3\].

c\) IRP-related requirements in 3GPP TS 32.600 \[4\].

The NRM defined by this IRP:

d\) Shall support communications for telecommunication network
management purposes, including management of converged networks.

e\) Is a member of the Federated Network Information Model (FNIM) \[8\]
and its information is derived from FNIM Umbrella Information Model
(UIM) \[9\]

In addition to the above, the following more specific requirements
apply:

**REQ-HNS\_GW-CON-001** The Network Resource Model defined by this IRP
shall contain HNB GW specific IOCs and related definitions.

**REQ-HNS\_GW-CON-002** The Network Resource Model defined by this IRP
shall provide support for enabling consistency between HNB GW, HNB and
related core network nodes.

**REQ-HNS\_GW-CON-003** The NRM specified by this IRP shall be able to
view configuration information of the HNB GW entity. More detailed
information is as follows:

Shall allow for the viewing of basic configuration information including
version, equipment type, equipment provider and unique identification,
etc.

Shall allow for the viewing of network configuration information
including IP address, sub-network mask, default gateway and port
configuration information, etc.

Shall allow for the viewing of service related configuration
information, for example the maximum number of HNB to be registered, the
maximum number of packets to be forwarded, etc.

**REQ-HNS\_GW-CON-004** The NRM specified by this IRP shall capture Iuh
interface information of HNB GW. More detailed information is as
follows:

Shall allow for the viewing of basic configuration information including
Iuh identification etc.

Shall allow for the viewing of network configuration information
including SCTP management information, etc.

**REQ-HNS\_GW-CON-005** The NRM specified by this IRP shall capture the
identity of registered HNB.
