Foreword

This Technical Specification\| has been produced by the 3rd Generation
Partnership Project (3GPP).

The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work
within the TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the
TSG modify the contents of the present document, it will be re-released
by the TSG with an identifying change of release date and an increase in
version number as follows:

Version x.y.z

where:

x the first digit:

1 presented to TSG for information;

2 presented to TSG for approval;

3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.

y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e.
technical enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.

z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been
incorporated in the document.

In the present document, modal verbs have the following meanings:

**shall** indicates a mandatory requirement to do something

**shall not** indicates an interdiction (prohibition) to do something

The constructions \"shall\" and \"shall not\" are confined to the
context of normative provisions, and do not appear in Technical Reports.

The constructions \"must\" and \"must not\" are not used as substitutes
for \"shall\" and \"shall not\". Their use is avoided insofar as
possible, and they are not used in a normative context except in a
direct citation from an external, referenced, non-3GPP document, or so
as to maintain continuity of style when extending or modifying the
provisions of such a referenced document.

**should** indicates a recommendation to do something

**should not** indicates a recommendation not to do something

**may** indicates permission to do something

**need not** indicates permission not to do something

The construction \"may not\" is ambiguous and is not used in normative
elements. The unambiguous constructions \"might not\" or \"shall not\"
are used instead, depending upon the meaning intended.

**can** indicates that something is possible

**cannot** indicates that something is impossible

The constructions \"can\" and \"cannot\" are not substitutes for \"may\"
and \"need not\".

**will** indicates that something is certain or expected to happen as a
result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside
the scope of the present document

**will not** indicates that something is certain or expected not to
happen as a result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which
is outside the scope of the present document

**might** indicates a likelihood that something will happen as a result
of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document

**might not** indicates a likelihood that something will not happen as a
result of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside
the scope of the present document

In addition:

**is** (or any other verb in the indicative mood) indicates a statement
of fact

**is not** (or any other negative verb in the indicative mood) indicates
a statement of fact

The constructions \"is\" and \"is not\" do not indicate requirements.

Introduction
============

The present document is part of a TS-family covering the 3rd Generation
Partnership Project; Technical Specification Group Services and System
Aspects; Telecommunication management, as identified below:

**TS 28.307: Management of Quality of Experience (QoE) measurement
collection Integration Reference Point (IRP); Requirements**

TS 28.308: Management of Quality of Experience (QoE) measurement
collection Integration Reference Point (IRP); Information Service (IS)

TS 28.309: Management of Quality of Experience (QoE) measurement
collection Integration Reference Point (IRP); Solution Set (SS)
definitions

One main motivation of mobile network evolution is to improve the user
experience why the evaluation at the UE side is vital to network
operators, especially when the operators provide some real-time services
which require for example high date rate and low latency like streaming
services (typically video services).

Quality of Experience (QoE) information collection provides detailed
information at session level on a number of UEs.

The operator can initiate logging of QoE information of an end user
service. The collected information (specified in 3GPP TS 26.247 \[2\])
cannot be deduced from performance measurements in the mobile network.

The QoE information is information collected by the end user application
in the UE.

The QoE information is collected by the management system (e.g. an
Operations System (OS) in TMN terminology) for analysis and/or KPI
calculations.

1 Scope
=======

The present document addresses Integration Reference Point (IRP)
requirements for the function Quality of Experience (QoE) measurement
collection in UMTS and LTE. The measurements that are collected are DASH
\[2\] and MTSI \[5\] measurements.

The function includes collecting QoE information from UEs frequenting a
specified area.

The following documents contain provisions which, through reference in
this text, constitute provisions of the present document.

\- References are either specific (identified by date of publication,
edition number, version number, etc.) or non‑specific.

\- For a non-specific reference, the latest version applies. In the case
of a reference to a 3GPP document (including a GSM document), a
non-specific reference implicitly refers to the latest version of that
document *in the same Release as the present document*.

=================================================

3.1 Terms
---------

For the purposes of the present document, the terms given in
TR 21.905 \[1\] and the following apply. A term defined in the present
document takes precedence over the definition of the same term, if any,
in TR 21.905 \[1\].

3.3 Abbreviations
-----------------

For the purposes of the present document, the abbreviations given in
TR 21.905 \[1\] and the following apply. An abbreviation defined in the

NRS Network Request Session

NOTE: See TS 28.404 \[3\].

RECS RECording Session

NOTE: See 3GPP TS 28.404 \[3\].

UERS UE Request Session

NOTE: See 3GPP TS 28.404 \[3\].

4 Concepts and background
=========================

The collection of QoE information for a specified end user service/end
user service type either from UEs in a specified area. The collected
*information* is transported to a collection centre, where it can be
analysed and/or KPIs can be calculated.

*A collection can be requested by an operator technician via the
management system to the traffic network. As the network do not have any
knowledge which UEs have the capability to record the requested data,
therefore the UEs will report whether they have this capability or not
when a session set up. UEs that has this capability that match the
request from the management system will be requested to start recording
the requested information when the request constraints are met. The UE
will make the recorded data available for management system.*

5 Business Level Requirements
=============================

See business level requirements in 3GPP TS 28.404 \[3\]*.*

6 Specification level requirements
==================================

6.1 Requirements
----------------

**REQ-EUSPC-FUN-1**: The IRPManager shall have a capability to request
collection of QoE information per end user service/end user service type
for a specified area.

**REQ-EUSPC-FUN-2**: The IRPManager shall have a capability to request
the collection of QoE information to be stopped before the time for the
NRS has expired.

**REQ-EUSPC-FUN-3**: The IRPAgent shall have a capability to notify the
IRPManager when a collection of QoE information has been stopped before
the time for the NRS has expired.
