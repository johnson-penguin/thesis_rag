Foreword
========

This Technical Specification has been produced by the 3^rd^ Generation
Partnership Project (3GPP).

The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work
within the TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the
TSG modify the contents of the present document, it will be re-released
by the TSG with an identifying change of release date and an increase in
version number as follows:

Version x.y.z

where:

x the first digit:

1 presented to TSG for information;

2 presented to TSG for approval;

3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.

y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e.
technical enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.

z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been
incorporated in the document.

3 Definitions and abbreviations
===============================

3.1 Definitions
---------------

For the purposes of the present document, the terms and definitions
given in 3GPP TR 21.905 \[1\] and in 3GPP TS 28.500 \[7\] and the
following apply. A term defined in the present document takes precedence
over the definition of the same term, if any, in 3GPP TR 21.905 \[1\] or
in 3GPP TS 28.500 \[7\].

3.2 Abbreviations
-----------------

For the purposes of the present document, the abbreviations given in
3GPP TR 21.905 \[1\] and in 3GPP TS 28.500 \[7\] and the following
apply. An abbreviation defined in the present document takes precedence
over the definition of the same abbreviation, if any, in 3GPP
TR 21.905 \[1\] or in 3GPP TS 28.500 \[7\].

4 Information Model Definition
==============================

4.1 Itf-N
---------

For Itf-N configuration management of virtualized network functions
which can be part of EPC or IMS, the IOCs defined in3GPP TS 28.622
\[4\], 28.708\[5\] and 28.705\[6\] shall be reused.

In 3GPP TS 28.622 \[4\], a new attribute vnfParametersList is added in
the IOC *ManagedFunction* (see clause 4.3.4 in \[4\]) to support the
configuration management of virtualized network functions which can be
part of EPC or IMS.

5 Interface Definition
======================

5.1 Itf-N
---------

For Itf-N configuration management of virtualized network functions
which can be part of EPC or IMS, the operations defined in 3GPP TS
32.602 \[2\] and TS 32.612 \[8\] and notifications defined in
3GPP TS 32.662 \[3\] shall be reused.

5.2 CM interface over Os-Ma-nfvo
--------------------------------

None.

5.3 CM interface over Ve-Vnfm-em
--------------------------------

None.

5.4 CM interface over Ve-Vnfm-vnf
---------------------------------

None.
