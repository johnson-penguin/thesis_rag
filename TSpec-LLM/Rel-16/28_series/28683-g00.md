Foreword
========

This Technical Specification has been produced by the 3^rd^ Generation
Partnership Project (3GPP).

The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work
within the TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the
TSG modify the contents of the present document, it will be re-released
by the TSG with an identifying change of release date and an increase in
version number as follows:

Version x.y.z

where:

x the first digit:

1 presented to TSG for information;

2 presented to TSG for approval;

3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.

y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e.
technical enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.

z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been
incorporated in the document.

Introduction
============

The present document is part of a TS-family covering the 3^rd^
Generation Partnership Project Technical Specification Group Services
and System Aspects, Telecommunication management; as identified below:

TS 28.680: Telecommunication management; Wireless Local Area Network
(WLAN) management; Concepts and requirements

TS 28.681: Telecommunication management; Wireless Local Area Network
(WLAN) Network Resource Model (NRM) Integration Reference Point (IRP);
Requirements

TS 28.682: Telecommunication management; Wireless Local Area Network
(WLAN) Network Resource Model (NRM) Integration Reference Point (IRP);
Information Service (IS)

**TS 28.683: Telecommunication management; Wireless Local Area Network
(WLAN) Network Resource Model (NRM) Integration Reference Point (IRP);
Solution Set (SS) definitions**

1 Scope
=======

The present document is part of an Integration Reference Point (IRP)
named Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) Management Network Resource
Model (NRM) IRP, through which an IRPAgent can communicate management
information to one or several IRPManagers concerning WLAN management.
The WLAN management NRM IRP comprises a set of specifications defining
Requirements, a protocol neutral Information Service and one or more
Solution Set(s).

The present document specifies the Solution Sets for the WLAN NRM
IRP**.**

2 References
============

The following documents contain provisions which, through reference in
this text, constitute provisions of the present document.

\- References are either specific (identified by date of publication,
edition number, version number, etc.) or non‑specific.

\- For a specific reference, subsequent revisions do not apply.

\- For a non-specific reference, the latest version applies. In the case
of a reference to a 3GPP document (including a GSM document), a
non-specific reference implicitly refers to the latest version of that
document *in the same Release as the present document*.

3 Definitions and abbreviations
===============================

3.1 Definitions
---------------

For the purposes of the present document, the terms and definitions
given in 3GPP TR 21.905 \[1\] and 3GPP TS 32.150 \[3\] apply. A term
defined in the present document takes precedence over the definition of
the same term, if any, in 3GPP TR 21.905 \[1\].

3.2 Abbreviations
-----------------

For the purposes of the present document, the abbreviations given in
3GPP TR 21.905 \[1\], 3GPP TS 32.150 \[3 and the following apply. An
abbreviation defined in the present document takes precedence over the
definition of the same abbreviation, if any, in 3GPP TR 21.905 \[1\] or
3GPP TS 32.150 \[3\].

WLAN Wireless Local Area Network

4 Solution Set definitions
==========================

Since the instances of all of the IOC(s) defined in WLAN NRM IS (3GPP TS
28.682 \[2\]) are not visible to Basic CM IRP and Bulk CM IRP, there is
no need to define solution sets in the present document.
