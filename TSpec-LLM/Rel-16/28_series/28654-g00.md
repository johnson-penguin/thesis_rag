Foreword
========

This Technical Specification has been produced by the 3^rd^ Generation
Partnership Project (3GPP).

The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work
within the TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the
TSG modify the contents of the present document, it will be re-released
by the TSG with an identifying change of release date and an increase in
version number as follows:

Version x.y.z

where:

x the first digit:

1 presented to TSG for information;

2 presented to TSG for approval;

3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.

y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e.
technical enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.

z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been
incorporated in the document.

Introduction
============

The present document is part of a TS-family covering the 3^rd^
Generation Partnership Project; Technical Specification Group Services
and System Aspects; Telecommunication management; as identified below:

**28.654: GSM/EDGE Radio Access Network (GERAN) Network Resource Model
(NRM) Integration Reference Point (IRP); Requirements**

4 Requirements
==============

The following general and high-level requirements apply for the present
IRP:

a\) IRP-related requirements in 3GPP TS 32.101 \[1\].

b\) IRP-related requirements in 3GPP TS 32.102 \[2\].

c\) IRP-related requirements in 3GPP TS 32.600 \[3\].

The NRM defined by this IRP:

a\) Shall support communications for telecommunication network
management purposes, including management of converged networks.

b\) Is a member of the Federated Network Information Model (FNIM) \[4\]
and its information is derived from FNIM Umbrella Information Model
(UIM) \[5\].

In addition to the above, the following more specific requirements
apply:

> **REQ-GERAN\_NRM-CON-001:** The Network Resource Model defined by this
> IRP shall contain GERAN specific classes and related definitions,
> supporting the management of GERAN Network entities.
>
> **REQ-GERAN\_NRM-CON-002:** The Network Resource Model defined by this
> IRP shall support management of UMTS-GSM Inter-system handover.
