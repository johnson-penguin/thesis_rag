Foreword
========

This Technical Specification has been produced by the 3^rd^ Generation
Partnership Project (3GPP).

The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work
within the TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the
TSG modify the contents of the present document, it will be re-released
by the TSG with an identifying change of release date and an increase in
version number as follows:

Version x.y.z

where:

x the first digit:

1 presented to TSG for information;

2 presented to TSG for approval;

3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.

y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e.
technical enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.

z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been
incorporated in the document.

Introduction
============

Subscription Management is a feature that permits Service Providers,
Value Added Service Providers and Mobile Operators to provision services
for a specific subscriber. Subscription Management is an area of Service
Operation Management that sets a complex challenge for Service Providers
and Operators in their support of new or existing subscribers during
their every day network operation.

The present document is part a TS-family covering the 3^rd^ Generation
Partnership Project; Technical Specification Group Services and System
Aspects; Telecommunication management, as identified below:

TS 32.140: Subscription Management (SuM) requirements.

TS 32.141: Subscription Management (SuM) architecture.

**TS 28.751: Subscription Management (SuM) Network Resource Model (NRM)
Integration Reference Point (IRP); Requirements.**

TS 28.752: Subscription Management (SuM) Network Resource Model (NRM)
Integration Reference Point (IRP); Information Service (IS).

**TS 28.753: Subscription Management (SuM) Network Resource Model (NRM)
