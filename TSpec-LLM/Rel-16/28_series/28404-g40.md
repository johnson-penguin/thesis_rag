Introduction
============

The present document is part of a TS-family covering the 3rd Generation
Partnership Project; Technical Specification Group Services and System
Aspects; Telecommunication management, as identified below:

**TS 28.404: \"Quality of Experience (QoE) measurement collection;
Concepts, use cases and requirements\";**

TS 28.405: \"Quality of Experience (QoE) measurement collection; Control
and configuration\";

TS 28.406: \"Quality of Experience (QoE) measurement collection;
Information definition and transport\";

One main motivation of mobile network evolution is to improve the user
experience, which is why the evaluation of the user experience at the UE
side is vital to network operators. This is especially true when the
operators provide high bit rate real-time services like streaming
services (typically video services), where even intermittent quality
degradation is very annoying. Many of these streaming services are a
significant part of the commercial traffic growth rate, therefore the
focus is on the end users\' experience .

Quality of Experience (QoE) information collection provides detailed
information at call level on a number of UEs.

The capability to log information within a UE, and in particular the QoE
of an end user service, initiated by an operator, provides the operator
with QoE information. The collected information (specified in TS 26.247
\[2\]) cannot be deduced from performance measurements in the mobile
network.

The QoE information is information collected by the end user application
in the UE.

The QoE information is collected by the management system for analysis
and/or KPI calculations.

1 Scope
=======

The present document addresses concepts, business level use cases and
requirements for the function Quality of Experience (QoE) measurement
collection in UMTS and LTE. The measurements that are collected are DASH
\[2\] and MTSI \[3\] measurements.

The function includes collecting QoE information from UEs frequenting a
specified area .

QoE Quality of Experience

4 Concepts and background
=========================

4.1 *Concepts*
--------------

A network request session is a session in the mobile network when the
network checks for UEs that have the capability to provide requested
information.

An UE request session is a session in the network when the network has
found an UE that has the capability to provide the requested information
and the request is forwarded to the UE.

A recording session is a session in the UE when it initiates recording
of the requested end user service/end user service type and record the
requested information.

4.2 Background
--------------

The collection of QoE information for a specified end user service/end
user service type either from UEs in a specified area . The collected
*information* is transported to a collection centre, where it can be
analysed and/or KPIs can be calculated.

*A collection can be requested by an operator technician via the
management system to the traffic network. As the network do not have any
knowledge which UEs have the capability to record the requested data,
therefore the UEs will report whether they have this capability or not
when a session set up. UEs that has this capability that match the
request from the management system will be requested to start recording
the requested information when the request constraints are met. The UE
will make the recorded data available for management system.*

5 Business Level Requirements
=============================

5.1 Requirements
----------------

### 5.1.1 Collecting QoE information from end user services for UTRAN and LTE

**REQ-EUSPC-CON-1:** The operator shall have a capability to request
collection of QoE information per end user service/end user service type
for a specified area. The request may include an address of a collection
centre to which the collected information shall be delivered.

**REQ-EUSPC-CON-2:** The application providing the end user service
performance information should have the capability to provide this
information to a collection centre.

**REQ-EUSPC-CON-3:** It should be possible to restrict the QoE
information collection to a subset of the sessions in a UE using an end
user service/end user service type.

**REQ-EUSPC-CON-4:** Void.

**REQ-EUSPC-CON-5:** The management system shall have a capability to
request collection of end user service performance information for a
specific service type provided by specific streaming sources. The
request may include information of streaming sources for which the
information shall be collected.
