Foreword
========

This Technical Specification (TS) has been produced by the 3^rd^
Generation Partnership Project (3GPP).

The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work
within the TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the
TSG modify the contents of the present document, it will be re-released
by the TSG with an identifying change of release date and an increase in
version number as follows:

Version x.y.z

where:

x the first digit:

1 presented to TSG for information;

2 presented to TSG for approval;

3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.

y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e.
technical enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.

z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been
incorporated in the document.

Introduction
============

The present document is part of a TS-family covering the 3^rd^
Generation Partnership Project; Technical Specification Group Services
and System Aspects; Telecommunication management; as identified below:

28.624 State Management Data Definition Integration Reference Point
(IRP); Requirements;

**28.625 State Management Data Definition Integration Reference Point
(IRP); Information Service (IS) ;**

**28.626 State Management Data Definition Integration Reference Point
(IRP); Solution Set (SS) definitions.**

This specification is part of a set that has been developed for
converged management solutions.

1 Scope
=======

The present document specifies the State Management Data Definition IRP
Information Service that can be communicated between an IRPAgent and an
IRPManager for telecommunication network management purposes, including
management of converged networks.

The present document specifies the semantics and behaviour of
information object class attributes and relations visible across the
reference point in a protocol and technology neutral way. It does not
define their syntax and encoding.

2 References
============

The following documents contain provisions which, through reference in
this text, constitute provisions of the present document.

\- References are either specific (identified by date of publication,
edition number, version number, etc.) or non‑specific.

\- For a specific reference, subsequent revisions do not apply.

\- For a non-specific reference, the latest version applies. In the case
of a reference to a 3GPP document (including a GSM document), a
non-specific reference implicitly refers to the latest version of that
document *in the same Release as the present document*.

### 4.2.1 Relationships 

There is no relationship.

### 4.2.2 Inheritance

There are no inheritance relationships.

4.3 Class definitions
---------------------

### 4.3.1 StateManagementEntity

#### 4.3.1.1 Definition

StateManagementEntity is an Archetype, that may represent any IOC
defined in the Network Resource Models, e.g. Generic Network Resource
Model, Core Network Resource Model, UTRAN Network Resource Model or
GERAN Network Resource Model.

The attributes defined for this Archetype can be imported and used in
any IOC of the Network Resource Models, where such attributes are
needed. These attributes shall be used in the same way as defined in the
ITU‑T Recommendation X.731 \[7\] and ITU‑T Recommendation X.733 \[8\],
unless otherwise stated. That document gives also examples of state
diagrams, defining possible state transitions when one or more of the
state attributes defined here are used in a class.

#### 4.3.1.2 Attributes

The following attributes are defined for this Archetype.

  ---------------------
  Attribute Name
  operationalState
  usageState
  administrativeState
  alarmStatus
  proceduralStatus
  availabilityStatus
  controlStatus
  standbyStatus
  unknownStatus
  ---------------------

#### 4.3.1.3 Attribute constraints

None.
