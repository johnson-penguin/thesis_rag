Foreword
========

This Technical Specification has been produced by the 3rd Generation
Partnership Project (3GPP).

The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work
within the TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the
TSG modify the contents of the present document, it will be re-released
by the TSG with an identifying change of release date and an increase in
version number as follows:

Version x.y.z

where:

x the first digit:

1 presented to TSG for information;

2 presented to TSG for approval;

3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.

y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e.
technical enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.

z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been
incorporated in the document.

Introduction
============

The present document is part of a TS-family covering the 3^rd^
Generation Partnership Project Technical Specification Group Services
and System Aspects, Telecommunication management; as identified below:

**TS 28.611: \"Evolved Packet Core (EPC) and non-3GPP access
interworking system Network Resource Model (NRM) Integration Reference
Point (IRP); Requirements\"**

TS 28.612: **\"**Evolved Packet Core (EPC) and non-3GPP access
interworking system Network Resource Model (NRM) Integration Reference
Point (IRP); Information Service (IS)**\"**

1 Scope
=======

The present document describes the Network Resource Model (NRM)
Integration Reference Point (IRP) requirements for the EPC and WLAN
interworking system according to the structure defined in 3GPP TS
23.402 \[8\] (e.g. ePDG, 3GPP AAA, etc).

The following documents contain provisions which, through reference in
this text, constitute provisions of the present document.

\- References are either specific (identified by date of publication,
edition number, version number, etc.) or non‑specific.

\- For a specific reference, subsequent revisions do not apply.

\- For a non-specific reference, the latest version applies. In the case
of a reference to a 3GPP document (including a GSM document), a
non-specific reference implicitly refers to the latest version of that

For the purposes of the present document, the abbreviations given in
TR 21.905 \[1\] and the following apply.\
An abbreviation defined in the present document takes precedence over

NRM Network Resource Model

4 Concepts and background
=========================

The architectures of enhancement for non-3GPP access (i.e. WLAN) to 3GPP
system are defined in 3GPP TS 23.402 \[8\].\
In TS 23.402, three kinds of architectures are defined, using S2a, S2b
and S2c interface separately.\
The architectures of S2a and S2c don\'t introduce new network elements
in 3GPP system,\
while the architecture S2b introduces a new network element to support
the interworking:

> \- evolved Packet Data Gateway (ePDG) (clause 4.3.4 of
> 3GPP TS 23.402 \[8\]).

The above interworking related network element should be managed by the
3GPP OAM, and the corresponding NRM IRP needs to be defined.

Based on the above characteristics, this specification defines the
evolved 3GPP interworking WLAN NRM IRP requirements.

5 Requirements
==============

The following general and high-level requirements apply for the present
IRP:

a\) IRP-related requirements in 3GPP TS 32.101 \[2\].

b\) IRP-related requirements in 3GPP TS 32.102 \[3\].

c\) IRP-related requirements in 3GPP TS 32.600 \[4\].

In addition to the above, the following more specific requirements
apply:

**REQ-EPC\_WLAN-CON-001\
**The Network Resource Model defined by this IRP shall contain ePDG
specific IOCs and related definitions.\
This requirement should be satisfied when the S2b architecture is
implemented.

**REQ-EPC\_WLAN-CON-002\
**The Network Resource Model defined by this IRP shall contain 3GPP AAA
specific IOCs and related definitions.
