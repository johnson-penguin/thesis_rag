within the TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the
TSG modify the contents of the present document, it will be re-released
by the TSG with an identifying change of release date and an increase in
version number as follows:

Version x.y.z

where:

x the first digit:

1 presented to TSG for information;

2 presented to TSG for approval;

3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.

y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e.
technical enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.

z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been
incorporated in the document.

1 Scope
=======

The document describes the requirements for Home eNodeB Subsystem
(HeNS), which include Home eNodeB (HeNB) and Home eNodeB gateway (HeNB
GW). The HeNS NRM IRP requirements are targeted on both HeNB and HeNB GW
NRM.

4 Concepts and background
=========================

HeNB Subsystem is defined in TS 23.401\[6\]. According to the
definition, a HeNB Subsystem consists of a HeNB and optionally a HeNB
GW. The HeNB Subsystem is connected by means of the standard S1
interface to the EPC (Evolved Packet Core), more specifically to the MME
(Mobility Management Entity) by means of the S1-MME interface and to the
Serving Gateway (S-GW) by means of the S1-U interface.

Detailed functions of HeNB and HeNB GW are described in TS 36.300 \[7\].
To be more specific, HeNB is a Customer Premise Equipment that offers
the LTE-Uu Interface to the UE. And it could discovery a suitable
Serving HeNB GW over S1 interface. A HeNB GW can relay UE-associated S1
application part messages between the MME serving the UE and the HeNB
serving the UE. It could terminate non-UE associated S1 application part
procedures towards the HeNB and towards the MME and optionally terminate
S1-U interface with the HeNB and with the S-GW.

Based on the above characteristics, this specification defines
respective HeNS NRM IRP requirements.

5 Requirements 
==============

The following general and high-level requirements apply for the present
IRP:

a\) IRP-related requirements in 3GPP TS 32.101 \[2\].

b\) IRP-related requirements in 3GPP TS 32.102 \[3\].

c\) IRP-related requirements in 3GPP TS 32.600 \[4\].

The NRM defined by this IRP:

d\) Shall support communications for telecommunication network
management purposes, including management of converged networks.

e\) Is a member of the Federated Network Information Model (FNIM) \[8\]
and its information is derived from FNIM Umbrella Information Model
(UIM) \[9\]

In addition to the above, the following more specific requirements
apply:

**REQ-HeNS\_GW-CON-001** The Network Resource Model defined by this IRP
shall contain HeNB GW specific IOCs and related definitions..

**REQ-HeNS\_GW-CON-002** The Network Resource Model defined by this IRP
shall provide support for enabling consistency between HeNB GW, HeNB and
related EPC nodes.
