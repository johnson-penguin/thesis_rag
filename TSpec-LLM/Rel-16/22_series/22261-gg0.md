Introduction
============

The need to support different kinds of UEs (e.g. for the Internet of
Things (IoT)), services, and technologies is driving the technology
revolution to a high-performance and highly efficient 3GPP system. The
drivers include IoT, Virtual Reality (VR), industrial control,
ubiquitous on-demand coverage, as well as the opportunity to meet
customized market needs. These drivers require enhancements to the
devices, services, and technologies well established by 3GPP. The key
objective with the 5G system is to be able to support new deployment
scenarios to address diverse market segments.

This document compiles requirements that define a 5G system.

The 5G system is characterised, for example, by:

\- Support for multiple access technologies

\- Scalable and customizable network

\- Advanced Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) (e.g. availability,
latency, reliability, user experienced data rates, area traffic
capacity)

\- Flexibility and programmability (e.g. network slicing, diverse
mobility management, Network Function Virtualization)

\- Resource efficiency (both user plane and control plane)

\- Seamless mobility in densely populated and heterogeneous environment

\- Support for real time and non-real time multimedia services and
applications with advanced Quality of Experience (QoE)

1 Scope

3 Definitions, symbols and abbreviations
========================================

3.1 Definitions
---------------

For the purposes of the present document, the terms and definitions
given in 3GPP TR 21.905 \[1\] and the following apply. A term defined in
the present document takes precedence over the definition of the same
term, if any, in 3GPP TR 21.905 \[1\].

**5G LAN-type service**: a service over the 5G system offering private
communication using IP and/or non-, i.e. UEs that are members of the
same 5G LAN-VN IP type communications.

**5G LAN-virtual network**: a virtual network capable of supporting 5G
LAN-type service.

**active communication:** a UE is in active communication when it has
one or more connections established. A UE may have any combination of PS
connections (e.g. PDP contexts, active PDN connections).

**activity factor:** percentage value of the amount of simultaneous
active UEs to the total number of UEs where active means the UEs are
exchanging data with the network.

**area traffic capacity:** total traffic throughput served per
geographic area.

**communication service availability**: percentage value of the amount
of time the end-to-end communication service is delivered according to
an agreed QoS, divided by the amount of time the system is expected to
deliver the end-to-end service according to the specification in a
specific area.

NOTE 1: The end point in \"end-to-end\" is assumed to be the
communication service interface.

NOTE 2: The communication service is considered unavailable if it does
not meet the pertinent QoS requirements. If availability is one of these
requirements, the following rule applies: the system is considered
unavailable if an expected message is not received within a specified
time, which, at minimum, is the sum of maximum allowed end-to-end
latency and survival time.

**direct network connection:** one mode of network connection, where
there is no relay UE between a UE and the 5G network.

**end-to-end latency:** the time that takes to transfer a given piece of
information from a source to a destination, measured at the
communication interface, from the moment it is transmitted by the source
to the moment it is successfully received at the destination.

**Hosted Service:** a service containing the operator\'s own
application(s) and/or trusted third party application(s) in the Service
Hosting Environment, which can be accessed by the user.

**IoT device:** a type of UE which is dedicated for a set of specific
use cases or services and which is allowed to make use of certain
features restricted to this type of UEs.

NOTE 3: An IoT device may be optimized for the specific needs of
services and application being executed (e.g. smart home/city, smart
utilities, e-Health and smart wearables). Some IoT devices are not
intended for human type communications.

**network slice:** a set of network functions and corresponding
resources necessary to provide the required telecommunication services
and network capabilities.

**NG-RAN:** a radio access network connecting to the 5G core network
which uses NR, E-UTRA, or both.

**non-public network:** a network that is intended for non-public use.

**NR:** the new 5G radio access technology.

**Positioning service availability:** percentage value of the amount of
time the positioning service is delivering the required position-related
data within the performance requirements, divided by the amount of time
the system is expected to deliver the positioning service according to
the specification in the targeted service area.

**Positioning service latency:** time elapsed between the event that
triggers the determination of the position-related data and the
availability of the position-related data at the system interface.

**priority service:** a service that requires priority treatment based
on regional/national or operator policies.

**private communication**: a communication between two or more UEs
belonging to a restricted set of UEs**.**

**private network:** an isolated network deployment that does not
interact with a public network.

**private slice:** a dedicated network slice deployment for the sole use
by a specific third party.

**relative positioning:** relative positioning is to estimate position
relatively to other network elements or relatively to other UEs.

**reliability**: in the context of network layer packet transmissions,
percentage value of the packets successfully delivered to a given system
entity within the time constraint required by the targeted service out
of all the packets transmitted.

**service area:** geographic region where a 3GPP communication service
is accessible.

NOTE 4: The service area can be indoors.

NOTE 5: For some deployments, e.g. in process industry, the vertical
dimension of the service area can be considerable.

**service continuity:** the uninterrupted user experience of a service
that is using an active communication when a UE undergoes an access
change without, as far as possible, the user noticing the change.

NOTE 6: In particular service continuity encompasses the possibility
that after a change the user experience is maintained by a different
telecommunication service (e.g. tele- or bearer service) than before the
change.

NOTE 7: Examples of access changes include the following. For EPS: CS/PS
domain change. For EPS and 5G: radio access change.

**Service Hosting Environment:** the environment, located inside of 5G
network and fully controlled by the operator, where Hosted Services are
offered from.

**survival time:** the time that an application consuming a
communication service may continue without an anticipated message.

**Time to First Fix (TTFF):** time elapsed between the event triggering
for the first time the determination of the position-related data and
the availability of the position-related data at the positioning system
interface.

**User Equipment:** An equipment that allows a user access to network
services via 3GPP and/or non-3GPP accesses.

**user experienced data rate:** the minimum data rate required to
achieve a sufficient quality experience, with the exception of scenario
for broadcast like services where the given value is the maximum that is
needed.

**wireless backhaul:** a link which provides an interconnection between
5G network nodes and/or transport network using 5G radio access
technology**.**

**5G positioning service area:** a service area where positioning
services would solely rely on infrastructures and positioning
technologies that can be assumed to be present anywhere where 5G is
present (e.g. a country-wide operator-supplied 5G network, GNSS,
position/motion sensors).

NOTE 8: This includes both indoor and any outdoor environments.

**5G Enhanced positioning area:** a subset of the 5G positioning service
area that is assumed to be provided with additional infrastructure or
deploy a particular set of positioning technologies to enhance
positioning services.

NOTE 9: The enhanced positioning service area represents for example a
factory plant, a dense urban area, an area along a road or railway
track, a tunnel and covers both indoor and outdoor environments.

4 Overview
==========

Unlike previous 3GPP systems that attempted to provide a \'one size fits
all\' system, the 5G system is expected to be able to provide optimized
support for a variety of different services, different traffic loads,
and different end user communities. Various industry white papers, most
notably, the NGMN 5G White Paper \[2\], describe a multi-faceted 5G
system capable of simultaneously supporting multiple combinations of
reliability, latency, throughput, positioning, and availability. This
technology revolution is achievable with the introduction of new
technologies, both in access and the core, such as flexible, scalable
assignment of network resources. In addition to increased flexibility
and optimization, a 5G system needs to support stringent KPIs for
latency, reliability, throughput, etc. Enhancements in the air interface
contribute to meeting these KPIs as do enhancements in the core network,
such as network slicing, in-network caching and hosting services closer
to the end points.

A 5G system also supports new business models such as those for IoT and
enterprise managed networks. Drivers for the 5G KPIs include services
such as Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) control, Augmented Reality (AR),
and factory automation. Network flexibility enhancements support
self-contained enterprise networks, installed and maintained by network
operators while being managed by the enterprise. Enhanced connection
modes and evolved security facilitate support of massive IoT, expected
to include tens of millions of UEs sending and receiving data over the
5G network.

Flexible network operations are the mainstay of the 5G system. The
capabilities to provide this flexibility include network slicing,
network capability exposure, scalability, and diverse mobility. Other
network operations requirements address the necessary control and data
plane resource efficiencies, as well as network configurations that
optimize service delivery by minimizing routing between end users and
application servers. Enhanced charging and security mechanisms handle
new types of UEs connecting to the network in different ways.

Mobile Broadband (MBB) enhancements aim to meet a number of new KPIs.
These pertain to high data rates, high user density, high user mobility,
highly variable data rates, deployment, and coverage. High data rates
are driven by the increasing use of data for services such as streaming
(e.g. video, music, and user generated content), interactive services
(e.g. AR), and IoT. These services come with stringent requirements for
user experienced data rates as well as associated requirements for
latency to meet service requirements. Additionally, increased coverage
in densely populated areas such as sports arenas, urban areas, and
transportation hubs has become essential for pedestrians and users in
urban vehicles. New KPIs on traffic and connection density enable both
the transport of high volumes of data traffic per area (traffic density)
and transport of data for a high number of connections (e.g. UE density
or connection density). Many UEs are expected to support a variety of
services which exchange either a very large (e.g. streaming video) or
very small (e.g. data burst) amount of data. The 5G system will handle
this variability in a resource efficient manner. All of these cases
introduce new deployment requirements for indoor and outdoor, local area
connectivity, high user density, wide area connectivity, and UEs
travelling at high speeds.

Another aspect of 5G KPIs includes requirements for various combinations
of latency and reliability, as well as higher accuracy for positioning.
These KPIs are driven by support for both commercial and public safety
services. On the commercial side, industrial control, industrial
automation, UAV control, and AR are examples of those services. Services
such as UAV control will require more precise positioning information
that includes altitude, speed, and direction, in addition to horizontal
coordinates.

Support for Massive Internet of Things (MIoT) brings many new
requirements in addition to those for the enhanced KPIs. The expansion
of connected things introduces a need for significant improvements in
resource efficiency in all system components (e.g. UEs, IoT devices,
radio, access network, core network).

The 5G system also aims to enhance its capability to meet KPIs that
emerging V2X applications require. For these advanced applications, the
requirements, such as data rate, reliability, latency, communication
range and speed, are made more stringent.

The 5G system shall support mobility procedures between a 5G core
network and an EPC with minimum impact to the user experience(e.g. QoS,

6 Basic capabilities
====================

6.1 Network slicing
-------------------

### 6.1.1 Description

Network slicing allows the operator to provide customised networks. For
example, there can be different requirements on functionality (e.g.
priority, charging, policy control, security, and mobility), differences
in performance requirements (e.g. latency, mobility, availability,
reliability and data rates), or they can serve only specific users (e.g.
MPS users, Public Safety users, corporate customers, roamers, or hosting
an MVNO).

A network slice can provide the functionality of a complete network,
including radio access network functions, core network functions (e.g.
potentially from different vendors) and IMS functions. One network can
support one or several network slices.

### 6.1.2 Requirements

#### 6.1.2.1 General

The serving 5G network shall support providing connectivity to home and
roaming users in the same network slice.

The 5G system shall allow the operator to assign a UE to a network
slice, to move a UE from one network slice to another, and to remove a
UE from a network slice based on subscription, UE capabilities, the
access technology being used by the UE, operator\'s policies and
services provided by the network slice.

The 5G system shall support a mechanism for the VPLMN, as authorized by
the HPLMN, to assign a UE to a network slice with the needed services or
to a default network slice.

The 5G system shall enable a UE to be simultaneously assigned to and
access services from more than one network slice of one operator.

Traffic and services in one network slice shall have no impact on
traffic and services in other network slices in the same network.

Creation, modification, and deletion of a network slice shall have no or
minimal impact on traffic and services in other network slices in the
same network.

The 5G system shall support scaling of a network slice, i.e. adaptation
of its capacity.

The 5G system shall enable the network operator to define a minimum
available capacity for a network slice. Scaling of other network slices
on the same network shall have no impact on the availability of the
minimum capacity for that network slice.

The 5G system shall enable the network operator to define a maximum
capacity for a network slice.

The 5G system shall enable the network operator to define a priority
order between different network slices in case multiple network slices
compete for resources on the same network.

different network slices.

#### 6.1.2.3 Network slice constraints

The 5G system shall support a mechanism to prevent a UE from trying to
access a radio resource dedicated to a specific private slice for any
purpose other than that authorized by the associated third party.

NOTE 1: UEs that are not authorized to access a specific private slice
will not be able to access it for emergency calls if the private slice
does not support emergency services.

The 5G system shall support a mechanism to configure a specific
geographic area in which a network slice is accessible, i.e. a UE shall
be within the geographical area in order to access the network slice.

The 5G system shall support a mechanism to limit a UE to only receiving
service from an authorized slice.

#### 6.1.2.4 Cross-network slice coordination

The 5G system shall support a mechanism to provide time stamps with a
common time base at the monitoring API, for services that cross multiple
network slices and 5G networks.

The 5G system shall provide suitable APIs to coordinate network slices
in multiple 5G networks so that the selected communication services of a
non-public network can be extended through a PLMN (e.g. the service is
supported by a slice in the non-public network and a slice in the PLMN).

The 5G system shall provide a mechanism to enable an MNO to operate a
hosted non-public network and private slice(s) of its PLMN associated
with the hosted non-public network in a combined manner.

6.2 Diverse mobility management
-------------------------------

### 6.2.1 Description

A key feature of 5G is support for UEs with different mobility
management needs. 5G will support UEs with a range of mobility
management needs, including UEs that are

\- stationary during their entire usable life (e.g. sensors embedded in
infrastructure),

\- stationary during active periods, but nomadic between activations
(e.g. fixed access),

\- mobile within a constrained and well-defined space (e.g. in a
factory), and

\- fully mobile.

Moreover, some applications require the network to ensure seamless
mobility of a UE so that mobility is hidden from the application layer
to avoid interruptions in service delivery while other applications have
application specific means to ensure service continuity. But these other
applications may still require the network to minimize interruption time
to ensure that their application-specific means to ensure service
continuity work effectively.

With the ever-increasing multimedia broadband data volumes, it is also
important to enable the offloading of IP traffic from the 5G network
onto traditional IP routing networks via an IP anchor node close to the
network edge. As the UE moves, changing the IP anchor node may be needed
in order to reduce the traffic load in the system, reduce end-to-end
latency and provide a better user experience.

The flexible nature of a 5G system will support different mobility
management methods that minimize signalling overhead and optimize access
for these different types of UEs.

### 6.2.2 General requirements

The 5G network shall allow operators to optimize network behaviour (e.g.
mobility management support) based on the mobility patterns (e.g.
stationary, nomadic, spatially restricted mobility, full mobility) of a
UE or group of UEs.

The 5G system shall enable operators to specify and modify the types of
mobility support provided for a UE or group of UEs.

The 5G system shall optimize mobility management support for a UE or
group of UEs that use only mobile originated communications.

The 5G system shall support inter- and/or intra- access technology
mobility procedures within 5GS with minimum impact to the user
experience (e.g. QoS, QoE).

### 6.2.3 Service continuity requirements

The 5G system shall enable packet loss to be minimized during inter-
and/or intra- access technology changes for some or all connections
associated with a UE.

The 5G system shall minimize interruption time during inter- and/or
intra- access technology mobility for some or all connections associated
with a UE.

NOTE: The interruption time includes all delays which have impact on
service continuity.

For applications that require the same IP address during the lifetime of
the session, the 5G system shall enable maintaining the IP address
assigned to a UE when moving across different cells and access
technologies for connections associated with a UE.

The 5G system shall enable minimizing impact to the user experience
(e.g. minimization of interruption time) when changing the IP address
and IP anchoring point for some or all connections associated with a UE.

### 6.2.4 Void

6.3 Multiple access technologies
--------------------------------

### 6.3.1 Description

The 5G system will support 3GPP access technologies, including one or
more NR and E-UTRA as well as non-3GPP access technologies.
Interoperability among the various access technologies will be
imperative. For optimization and resource efficiency, the 5G system will
select the most appropriate 3GPP or non-3GPP access technology for a
service, potentially allowing multiple access technologies to be used
simultaneously for one or more services active on a UE. New technology
such as satellite and wide area base stations will increase coverage and
availability. This clause provides requirements for interworking with
the various combinations of access technologies.

### 6.3.2 Requirements

#### 6.3.2.1 General

Based on operator policy, the 5G system shall enable the UE to select,
manage, and efficiently provision services over the 3GPP or non-3GPP
access.

Based on operator policy, the 5G system shall support steering a UE to
select certain 3GPP access network(s).

Based on operator policy, the 5G system shall be able to dynamically
offload part of the traffic (e.g. from 3GPP RAT to non-3GPP access
technology), taking into account traffic load and traffic type.

Based on operator policy, the 5G system shall be able to provide
simultaneous data transmission via different access technologies, (e.g.
NR, E-UTRA, non-3GPP), to access one or more 3GPP services.

When a UE is using two or more access technologies simultaneously, the
5G system shall be able to optimally distribute user traffic over select
between access technologies in use, taking into account e.g. service,
traffic characteristics, radio characteristics, and UE\'s moving speed.

The 5G system shall be able to support data transmissions optimized for
different access technologies (e.g. 3GPP, non-3GPP) for UEs that are
simultaneously connected to the network via different accesses.

Based on operator policy, the 5G system shall be able to add or drop the
various access connections for a UE during a session.

unlicensed bands.

#### 6.3.2.2 E-UTRA access 

The 5G system shall be able to support seamless handover between NR and
E-UTRA.

The 5G system shall support UEs with dual radio capability (i.e. a UE
that can transmit on NR and E-UTRA simultaneously) as well as UEs with
single radio capability (i.e. a UE that cannot transmit on NR and E-UTRA
simultaneously).

#### 6.3.2.3 Void

#### 6.3.2.4 Fixed broadband access

The 5G system shall be able to efficiently support connectivity using
fixed broadband access.

NOTE: The specification of fixed broadband access network is outside the
scope of 3GPP.

The 5G system shall support use of a home base station that supports
multiple access types (e.g. 5G RAT, WLAN access, fixed broadband
access).

6.4 Resource efficiency
-----------------------

### 6.4.1 Description

5G introduces the opportunity to design a system to be optimized for
supporting diverse UEs and services. While support for IoT is provided
by EPS, there is room for improvement in efficient resource utilization
that can be designed into a 5G system whereas they are not easily
retrofitted into an existing system. Some of the underlying principles
of the potential service and network operation requirements associated
with efficient configuration, deployment, and use of UEs in the 5G
network include bulk provisioning, resource efficient access,
optimization for UE originated data transfer, and efficiencies based on
the reduced needs related to mobility management for stationary UEs and
UEs with restricted range of movement.

As sensors and monitoring UEs are deployed more extensively, the need to
support UEs that send data packages ranging in size from a small status
update in a few bits to streaming video increases. A similar need exists
for smart phones with widely varying amounts of data. Specifically, to
support short data bursts, the network should be able to operate in a
mode where there is no need for a lengthy and high overhead signalling
procedure before and after small amounts of data are sent. The system
will, as a result, avoid both a negative impact to battery life for the
UE and wasting signalling resources.

For small form factor UEs it will be challenging to have more than 1
antenna due to the inability to get good isolation between multiple
antennas. Thus these UEs need to meet the expected performance in a 5G
network with only one antenna.

Cloud applications like cloud robotics perform computation in the
network rather than in a UE, which requires the system to have high data
rate in the uplink and very low round trip latency. Supposed that high
density cloud robotics will be deployed in the future, the 5G system
need to optimize the resource efficiency for such scenario.

Additional resource efficiencies will contribute to meeting the various
KPIs defined for 5G. Control plane resource efficiencies can be achieved
by optimizing and minimizing signalling overhead, particularly for small
data transmissions. Mechanisms for minimizing user plane resources
utilization include in-network caching and application in a Service
Hosting Environment closer to the end user. These optimization efforts
contribute to achieving lower latency and higher reliability.

Diverse mobility management related resource efficiencies are covered in
clause 6.2.

Security related resource efficiencies are covered in clause 8.8.

### 6.4.2 Requirements

#### 6.4.2.1 General

The 5G system shall minimize control and user plane resource usage for
data transfer from send only UEs.

The 5G system shall minimize control and user plane resource usage for
stationary UEs (e.g. lower signalling to user data resource usage
ratio).

The 5G system shall minimize control and user plane resource usage for
transfer of infrequent small data units.

The 5G system shall optimize the resource use of the control plane
and/or user plane for transfer of small data units.

The 5G system shall optimize the resource use of the control plane
and/or user plane for transfer of continuous uplink data that requires
both high data rate (e.g. 10 Mbps) and very low end-to-end latency (e.g.
1-10 ms).

The 5G network shall optimize the resource use of the control plane
and/or user plane to support high density connections (e.g. 1 million
connections per square kilometre) taking into account, for example, the
following criteria:

\- type of mobility support;

\- communication pattern (e.g. send-only, frequent or infrequent);

\- characteristics of payload (e.g. small or large size data payload);

\- characteristics of application (e.g. provisioning operation, normal
data transfer);

\- UE location;

\- timing pattern of data transfer (e.g. real time or non-delay
sensitive).

The 5G system shall efficiently support service discovery mechanisms
where UEs can discover, subject to access rights:

\- status of other UEs (e.g. sound on/off);

\- capabilities of other UEs (e.g. the UE is a relay UE) and/or;

\- services provided by other UEs (e.g. the UE is a colour printer).

The 5G system shall be able to minimise the amount of wireless backhaul
traffic (e.g. consolidating data transmissions to 1 larger rather than
many smaller), when applicable (e.g. providing service in an area
subject to power outages).

The 5G system shall support small form factor UEs with single antenna.

NOTE: Small form factor UEs are typically expected to have the diagonal
less than 1/5 of the lowest supported frequency wave length.

#### 6.4.2.2 Efficient bulk operations for IoT

The 5G system shall support a timely, efficient, and/or reliable
mechanism to transmit the same information to multiple UEs.

#### 6.4.2.3 Efficient management for IoT

The 5G network shall optimize the resource use of the control plane
and/or user plane to manage (e.g. provide service parameters, activate,
deactivate) a UE.

The 5G network shall be able to provide policies for background data
transfer to a UE so that the 5G system can optimally use the control
plane and/or user plane resources.

#### 6.4.2.4 Efficient control plane

The 5G system shall minimize the signalling that is required prior to
user data transmission.

NOTE: The amount of signalling overhead may vary based on the amount of
data to be transmitted, even for the same UE.

6.5 Efficient user plane
------------------------

### 6.5.1 Description

5G is designed to meet diverse services with different and enhanced
performances (e.g. high throughput, low latency and massive connections)
and data traffic model (e.g. IP data traffic, non-IP data traffic, short
data bursts and high throughput data transmissions).

User plane should be more efficient for 5G to support differentiated
requirements. On one hand, a Service Hosting Environment located inside
of operator\'s network can offer Hosted Services closer to the end user
to meet localization requirement like low latency, low bandwidth
pressure. These Hosted Services contain applications provided by
operators and/or trusted third parties. On the other hand, user plane
paths can be selected or changed to improve the user experience or
reduce the bandwidth pressure, when a UE or application changes location
during an active communication.

### 6.5.2 Requirements

Based on operator policy, application needs, or both, the 5G system
shall support an efficient user plane path between UEs attached to the
same network, modifying the path as needed when the UE moves during an
active communication.

The 5G network shall enable a Service Hosting Environment provided by
operator.

Based on operator policy, the 5G network shall be able to support
routing of data traffic between a UE attached to the network and an
application in a Service Hosting Environment for specific services,
modifying the path as needed when the UE moves during an active
communication.

Based on operator policy, application needs, or both, the 5G system
shall support an efficient user plane path, modifying the path as needed
when the UE moves or application changes location, between a UE in an
active communication and:

\- an application in a Service Hosting Environment; or

\- an application server located outside the operator's network.

The 5G network shall maintain user experience (e.g. QoS, QoE) when a UE
in an active communication moves from a location served by a Service
Hosting Environment to:

\- another location served by a different Service Hosting Environment;
or

\- another location served by an application server located outside the
operator's network, and vice versa.

The 5G network shall maintain user experience (e.g. QoS, QoE) when an
application for a UE moves as follows:

\- within a Service Hosting Environment; or

\- from a Service Hosting Environment to another Service Hosting
Environment; or

\- from a Service Hosting Environment to an application server located
place outside the operator's network, and vice versa.

The 5G network shall be able to interact with applications in a Service
Hosting Environment for efficient network resource utilization and
offloading data traffic to the Service Hosting Environment close to the
UE\'s point of attachment to the access network.

The 5G network shall support configurations of the Service Hosting
Environment in the network (e.g. access network, core network), that
provide application access close to the UE\'s point of attachment to the
access network.

The 5G system shall support mechanisms to enable a UE to access the
closest Service Hosting Environment for a specific hosted application or
service.

The 5G network shall enable instantiation of applications for a UE in a
Service Hosting Environment close to the UE\'s point of attachment to
the access network.

The 5G system shall be able to suspend or stop application instances in
a Service Hosting Environment.

NOTE: Not all applications will always be available in all Service
Hosting Environments. Therefore, it may be needed to instantiate an
application at a Service Hosting Environment nearby for serving a
particular UE.

Based on operator policy, the 5G system shall provide a mechanism such
that one type of traffic (from a specific application or service)
to/from a UE can be offloaded close to the UE\'s point of attachment to
the access network, while not impacting other traffic type to/from that
same UE.

6.6 Efficient content delivery
------------------------------

### 6.6.1 Description

Video-based services (e.g. live streaming, VR) and personal data storage
applications have been instrumental for the massive growth in mobile
broadband traffic. Subject to service agreement between the operator and
the content provider, the information of content and content itself can
be aware by operator. In-network content caching provided by the
operator, a third party or both, can improve user experience, reduce
backhaul resource usage and utilize radio resource efficiently.

The operation of in-network caching includes flexible management of the
location of the content cache within the network and efficient delivery
of content to and from the appropriate content caching application.
Examples of services are the delivery of popular video content from a
content caching application via broadcast, and secure storage of a
user\'s personal data or files using a distributed caching application.
Such a service could also provide a student with a wireless backpack,
where students can resume their work through the same or a different UE
at any time, with very fast response times from the network.

### 6.6.2 Requirements

The 5G system shall enable efficient delivery of content from a content
caching application under the control of the operator (e.g. a cache
located close to the UE).

The 5G system shall support a content caching application in a UE under
the control of the operator.

The 5G system shall support configurations of content caching
applications in the network (e.g. access network, core network), that
provide content close to the UE.

Based on operator policy, the 5G system shall support an efficient
mechanism for selection of a content caching application (e.g. minimize
utilization of radio, backhaul resources and/or application resource)
for delivery of the cached content to the UE.

The 5G system shall support a mechanism for the operator to manage
content distribution across content caching applications.

The 5G system shall support delivery of cached content from a content
caching application via the broadcast/multicast service.

6.7 Priority, QoS, and policy control
-------------------------------------

### 6.7.1 Description

The 5G network will support many commercial services (e.g. medical) and
regional or national regulatory services (e.g. MPS, Emergency, Public
Safety) with requirements for priority treatment. Some of these services
share common QoS characteristics such as latency and packet loss rate,
but may have different priority requirements. For example, UAV control
and air traffic control may have stringent latency and reliability
requirements but not necessarily the same priority requirements. In
addition, voice-based services for MPS and Emergency share common QoS
characteristics as applicable for normal public voice communications,
yet may have different priority requirements. The 5G network will need
to support mechanisms that enable the decoupling of the priority of a
particular communication from the associated QoS characteristics such as
latency and reliability to allow flexibility to support different
priority services (that need to be configurable to meet operator needs,
consistent with operator policies and corresponding national and
regional regulatory policies).

The network needs to support flexible means to make priority decisions
based on the state of the network (e.g. during disaster events and
network congestion) recognizing that the priority needs may change
during a crisis. The priority of any service may need to be different
for a user of that service based on operational needs and regional or
national regulations. Therefore, the 5G system should allow a flexible
means to prioritise and enforce prioritisation among the services (e.g.
MPS, Emergency, medical, Public Safety) and among the users of these
services. The traffic prioritisation may be enforced by adjusting
resource utilization or pre-empting lower priority traffic.

The network must offer ~~a~~ means to provide the required QoS (e.g.
reliability, latency, and bandwidth) for a service and the ability to
prioritize resources when necessary to meet the service requirements.
Existing QoS and policy frameworks handle latency and improve
reliability by traffic engineering. In order to support 5G service
requirements, it is necessary for the 5G network to offer QoS and policy
control for reliable communication with latency required for a service
and enable the resource adaptations as necessary.

The network needs to allow multiple services to coexist, including
multiple priority services (e.g. Emergency, MPS and MCS) and must
provide means to prevent a single service from consuming or monopolizing
all available network resources, or impacting the QoS (e.g.
availability) of other services competing for resources on the same
network under specific network conditions. For example, it is necessary
to prevent certain services (e.g. citizen-to-authority Emergency)
sessions from monopolizing all available resources during events such as
disaster, emergency, and DDoS attacks from impacting the availability of
other priority services such as MPS and MCS.

Also, as 5G network is expected to operate in a heterogeneous
environment with multiple access technologies, multiple types of UE,
etc., it should support a harmonised QoS and policy framework that
applies to multiple accesses.

Further, for QoS control in EPS only covers RAN and core network, but
for 5G network E2E QoS (e.g. RAN, backhaul, core network, network to
network interconnect) is needed to achieve the 5G user experience (e.g.
ultra-low latency, ultra-high bandwidth).

### 6.7.2 Requirements

The 5G system shall allow flexible mechanisms to establish and enforce
priority policies among the different services (e.g. MPS, Emergency,
medical, Public Safety) and users.

NOTE 1: Priority between different services is subject to regional or
national regulatory and operator policies.

The 5G system shall be able to provide the required QoS (e.g.
reliability, end-to-end latency, and bandwidth) for a service and
support prioritization of resources when necessary for that service.

The 5G system shall enable the network operator to define and statically
configure a maximum resource assignment for a specific service that can
be adjusted based on the network state (e.g. during congestion,
disaster, emergency and DDoS events) subject to regional or national
regulatory and operator policies.

The 5G system shall allow decoupling of the priority of a particular
communication from the associated QoS characteristics such as end-to-end
latency and reliability.

The 5G system shall be able to support a harmonised QoS and policy
framework applicable to multiple accesses.

The 5G system shall be able to support E2E (e.g. UE to UE) QoS for a
service.

NOTE 2: E2E QoS needs to consider QoS in the access networks, backhaul,
core network, and network to network interconnect.

The 5G system shall be able to support QoS for applications in a Service
Hosting Environment.

6.8 Dynamic policy control
--------------------------

The 5G system shall support the creation and enforcement of
prioritisation policy for users and traffic, during connection setup and
when connected.

NOTE: Prioritisation, pre-emption, and precedence of critical traffic
associated with certain priority services (e.g. MPS and Emergency) are
subject to regional/national regulatory and operator policies.

The 5G system shall support optimised signalling for prioritised users
and traffic where such signalling is prioritized over other signalling
traffic.

Based on operator policy, the 5G system shall allow flexible means for
authorized entities to create and enforce priority among the different
service flows.

Based on operator policy, the 5G system shall support a real-time,
dynamic, secure and efficient means for authorized entities (e.g. users,
context aware network functionality) to modify the QoS and policy
framework. Such modifications may have a variable duration.

Based on operator policy, the 5G system shall maintain a session when
prioritization of that session changes in real time, provided that the
new priority is above the threshold for maintaining the session.

6.10 Network capability exposure
--------------------------------

### 6.10.1 Description

3GPP SEES and (e)FMSS features allow the operator to expose network
capabilities e.g. QoS policy to third party ISPs/ICPs. With the advent

allow an authorized third party to define and reconfigure the properties
of the communication services offered to the third party.

Based on operator policy, the 5G network shall expose a suitable API to
provide the security logging information of UEs, for example, the active
3GPP security mechanisms (e.g. data privacy, authentication, integrity
protection) to an authorized third party.

Based on operator policy, the 5G network shall be able to acknowledge
within 100ms a communication service request from an authorized third
party via a suitable API.

The 5G network shall provide suitable APIs to allow a trusted third
party to monitor the status (e.g. locations, lifecycle, registration

6.11 Context aware network
--------------------------

### 6.11.1 Description

A variety of sensors such as accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer,
barometer, proximity sensor, and GPS can be integrated in a UE. Also,
different applications running on the UE can have different
communication needs (e.g. different traffic time). In addition, a UE can
support different access technologies such as NR, E-UTRA, WLAN access
technology, and fixed broadband access technology. The information
gathered by sensors, the utilized access technologies, the application
context, and the application traffic characteristics can provide useful
information to the applications installed in the UE and can also help
the 5G system utilize resources in an efficient and optimized way.

### 6.11.2 Requirements

The 5G system shall support network resource utilization efficiently and
network optimization based on system information, including:

\- network conditions, such as network load and congestion information;

\- information on served UEs such as access information (e.g. 3GPP
access, non-3GPP access), cell type (e.g. macro cell, small cell), user
experienced data rate;

\- application\'s characteristics (e.g. expected traffic over time);

\- information on prioritized communication such as user subscription
profile and priority level, priority services (e.g. MPS, Emergency, and
Public Safety), application used for priority communications (e.g.
voice, video, and data) and traffic associated with priority
communications (signalling and media);

\- subject to user consent, enhanced traffic characteristic of UE (e.g.
Mobility information (e.g. no mobility, nomadic, spatially restricted
mobility, full mobility), location, sensor-level information (e.g.
direction, speed, power status, display status, other sensor information
installed in the UE), application-level information (e.g. foreground
applications, running background application, and user settings).

The 5G system shall support mechanisms to collect system information for
network optimization within an operator configured time scale.

6.12 Self backhaul
------------------

### 6.12.1 Description

The increased density of access nodes needed to meet future performance
objectives poses considerable challenges in deployment and management
(e.g. backhaul availability, backhaul capacity and scalability). The use
of wireless backhaul for such access nodes helps to address some of the
challenges.

Wireless self-backhauling in the radio access network can enable simpler
deployment and incremental rollout by reducing reliance on the
availability of wired backhaul at each access node location. Network
planning and installation efforts can be reduced by leveraging plug and
play type features \-- self-configuration, self-organizing, and
self-optimization.

### 6.12.2 Requirements

The 5G network shall enable operators to support wireless self-backhaul
using NR and E-UTRA.

The 5G network shall support flexible and efficient wireless
self-backhaul for both indoor and outdoor scenarios.

The 5G network shall support flexible partitioning of radio resources
between access and backhaul functions.

The 5G network shall support autonomous configuration of access and
wireless self-backhaul functions.

The 5G network shall support multi-hop wireless self-backhauling.

NOTE 1: This is to enable flexible extension of range and coverage area.

The 5G network shall support autonomous adaptation on wireless
self-backhaul network topologies to minimize service disruptions.

The 5G network shall support topologically redundant connectivity on the
wireless self-backhaul.

NOTE 2: This is to enhance reliability and capacity and reduce
end-to-end latency.

6.13 Flexible broadcast/multicast service
-----------------------------------------

### 6.13.1 Description

The proliferation of video services, ad-hoc multicast/broadcast streams,
software delivery over wireless, group communications and
broadcast/multicast IoT applications have created a need for a flexible
and dynamic allocation of radio resources between unicast and multicast
services within the network as well as support for a stand-alone
deployment of multicast/broadcast network. Moreover, enabling such a
service over a network for a wide range of inter-site distances between
the radio base stations will enable a more efficient and effective
delivery system for real-time and streaming multicast/broadcast content
over wide geographic areas as well as in specific geographic areas
spanning a limited number of base stations. A flexible
multicast/broadcast service will allow the 5G system to efficiently
deliver such services.

### 6.13.2 Requirements

The following set of requirements complement the requirements listed in
3GPP TS 22.146 \[7\], TS 22.246 \[8\] and TS 22.101 \[6\], clause 32.

The 5G system shall support operation of downlink only
broadcast/multicast over a specific geographic area (e.g. a cell sector,
a cell or a group of cells).

The 5G system shall support operation of a downlink only
broadcast/multicast system over a wide geographic area in a spectrally
efficient manner for stationary and mobile UEs.

The 5G system shall enable the operator to reserve 0% to 100% of radio
resources of one or more radio carriers for the delivery of
broadcast/multicast content.

The 5G network shall allow the UE to receive content via a
broadcast/multicast radio carrier while a concurrent data session is
ongoing over another radio carrier.

The 5G system shall be able to support broadcast/multicast of UHD
streaming video (e.g. 4K/8K UHD).

NOTE: Taking into account the bandwidth needs for different streaming
video resolution.

The 5G network shall allow the operator to configure and broadcast
multiple quality levels (i.e. video resolutions) of broadcast/multicast
content for the same user service in a stand-alone 3GPP based
broadcast/multicast system.

The 5G network shall support parallel transfer of multiple quality
levels (i.e. video resolutions) of broadcast/multicast content for the
same user service to the same UE taking into account e.g. UE capability,
radio characteristics, application information.

The 5G system shall support parallel transfer of multiple
multicast/broadcast user services to a UE.

The 5G system shall support a stand-alone multicast/broadcast network
comprising of multiple cells with inter-site distances of up to 200 km.

6.14 Subscription aspects
-------------------------

### 6.14.1 Description

With the Internet of Things, it is expected that the diversity of IoT
devices (e.g. sensors, UAVs, smart flower pots) and the usage models
will largely vary. Moreover, when the IoT device is manufactured, the
deployment location and specific usage may not be known. Sometimes the
IoT devices will be added to existing subscriptions, other times they
may be part of a new subscription for the user. Sometimes the IoT
devices may be leased. During their life cycle these IoT devices go
through different stages, involving the change in ownership when the IoT
device is deployed and possibly afterwards, the activation of the IoT
device by the preferred operator, a possible change of operators, etc.
These stages need to be managed securely and efficiently. A method of
dynamic subscription generation and management is needed in addition to
statically provisioned subscription. Once the subscription is
established, subscription management becomes necessary, for example, to
modify the subscription when the ownership of the IoT device changes, to
update or refresh credentials due to suspected leakage or theft of
security keys or as a preventive measure.

The Internet of Things will also support various connectivity models:
The IoT devices can connect with the network directly. In order to
identify and manage the IoT devices, a subscription with the 5G network
is needed, even if the access is done via non-3GPP access.

### 6.14.2 Requirements

An IoT device which is able to access a 5G PLMN in direct network
connection mode using a 3GPP RAT shall have a 3GPP subscription.

The 5G system shall allow the operator to identify a UE as an IoT device
based on UE characteristics (e.g. identified by an equipment identifier
or a range of equipment identifiers) or subscription or the combination
of both.

The 5G system shall be able to provide mechanisms to change the
association between a subscription and address/number of an IoT device
(e.g. changing the owner and subscription information associated with
the IoT device) within the same operator and in between different
operators in an automated or manual way.

The 5G system shall be able to support identification of subscriptions
independently of identification of IoT devices. Both identities shall be
secure.

Based on operator policy, the 5G system shall support a mechanism to
provision on-demand connectivity (e.g. IP connectivity for remote
provisioning). This on-demand mechanism should enable means for a user
to request on-the-spot network connectivity while providing operators
with identification and security tools for the provided connectivity.

The 5G system shall support a secure mechanism for a home operator to
remotely provision the 3GPP credentials of a uniquely identifiable and
verifiably secure IoT device.

6.15 Energy efficiency
----------------------

### 6.15.1 Description

Energy efficiency is a critical issue in 5G. The potential to deploy
systems in areas without a reliable energy source requires new methods
of managing energy consumption not only in the UEs but throughout all
components of the 5G system.

Small form factor UEs also typically have a small battery and this not
only puts constrains on general power optimization but also on how the
energy is consumed. With smaller batteries it is more important to
understand and follow the limitations for the both the maximum peak and
continuous current drain.

### 6.15.2 Requirements

The 5G access network shall support an energy saving mode with the
following characteristics:

\- the energy saving mode can be activated/deactivated either manually
or automatically;

\- service can be restricted to a group of users (e.g. public safety
user, emergency callers).

NOTE: When in energy saving mode the UE\'s and Access transmit power may
be reduced or turned off (deep sleep mode), end-to-end latency and
jitter may be increased with no impact on set of users or applications
still allowed.

The 5G system shall support mechanisms to improve battery life for a UE
over what is possible in EPS.

The 5G system shall support UEs using small rechargeable and single coin
cell batteries (e.g. considering impact on maximum pulse and continuous
current).

6.16 Markets requiring minimal service levels
---------------------------------------------

### 6.16.1 Description

A key aspect of 5G system flexibility is the ability to support both the
very high-end markets as well as very low-end markets. Some systems will
be deployed in areas where there are constraints on energy resources
(e.g. sporadic access to power) and lower end user expectations for
availability, reliability, and data rates. In such cases, the system
needs additional flexibility to adapt power consumption needs based on
fluctuations in power availability. The system should be efficient in
order to provide essential services in harsh environments (e.g. far
remote rural areas, very large territories) while taking into account
the local constraints (adapting resources consumptions to long
distances, dealing with variable conditions and possibly
disconnections). Content delivery should be optimized in order to reduce
constraints on transport networks, on low-end UEs (e.g. small screen,
limited energy consumption), variable network conditions, and client
profiles.

### 6.16.2 Requirements

In constrained circumstances (e.g. reduced power supply), the 5G system
shall be able to support a minimal user experience (e.g. user
experienced data rate of \[100\] kbps, E2E latency of 50 ms, lower
availability of the network of 95%).

The 5G system shall support centralized automation and management of the
network in order to reduce local management tasks.

The 5G system shall support a mechanism to reduce data transfer rate at
the cell edge for very large coverage area (e.g. 100 kbps for more than
100 km cell coverage, 1 Mbps for 100 km cell coverage).

The 5G system shall be able to give priority to services (e.g. e-Health)
when resources are limited.

6.17 Extreme long range coverage in low density areas
-----------------------------------------------------

### 6.17.1 Description

A fully connected society is expected in the near future. The network
access everywhere over long distances (e.g. at extreme rural areas or at
sea) including both humans and machines need to be supported.

### 6.17.2 Requirements

The 5G system shall support the extreme long-range coverage (up to 100
km) in low density areas (up to 2 user/km^2^).

The 5G system shall support a minimum user throughput of 1 Mbps on DL
and 100 kbps on UL at the edge of coverage.

The 5G system shall support a minimum cell throughput capacity of 10
Mbps/cell on DL (based on an assumption of 1 GB/month/sub).

The 5G system shall support a maximum of \[400\] ms E2E latency for
voice services at the edge of coverage.

6.18 Multi-network connectivity and service delivery across operators
---------------------------------------------------------------------

### 6.18.1 Description

Given the multitude of use cases for new verticals and services, each
operator, based on its business model, may deploy a network serving only
a subset of the vertical industries and services. However, this should
not prevent an end-user from accessing all new services and capabilities
that will be accessible via 5G systems. To provide a better user
experience for their subscribers with UEs capable of simultaneous
network access, network operators could contemplate a variety of sharing
business models and partnership with other network and service providers
to enable its subscribers to access all services via multiple networks
simultaneously, and with minimum interruption when moving.

### 6.18.2 Requirements

The 5G system shall enable users to obtain services from more than one
network simultaneously on an on-demand basis.

For a user with a single operator subscription, the use of multiple
serving networks operated by different operators shall be under the
control of the home operator.

When a service is offered by multiple operators, the 5G system shall be
able to maintain service continuity with minimum service interruption
when the serving network is changed to a different serving network
operated by a different operator.

NOTE 1: A business agreement is required between the network operators.

In the event of the same service being offered by multiple operators,
unless directed by the home operator\'s network, the UE shall be
prioritized to receive subscribed services from the home operator\'s
network.

NOTE 2: If the service is unavailable (e.g. due to lack of network
coverage) from the home operator\'s network, the UE may be able to
receive the service from another operator\'s network.

NOTE 3: QoS provided by the partner operator\'s network for the same
service will be based on the agreement between the two operators and
could be different than that provided by the home operator\'s network.

6.19 3GPP access network selection
----------------------------------

### 6.19.1 Description

The 5G system will support the concept of \"network slices\" where
different NG-RANs potentially are connected to network slices of
different SSTs. A 5G UE can provide assistance information (e.g. SST) to
enable the network to select one or more network slices. A 5G system is
foreseen to support one or more SSTs, but possibly not all existing
SSTs.

A 5G network operator controls and is responsible for what SSTs that
should be available to a specific UE and subscription combination, based
on associated subscription type, network operator policies, network
capabilities and UE capabilities. The network operator can populate the
Operator Controlled PLMN Selector list with associated access technology
identifiers, stored in the 5G UE, with the PLMN/RAT combinations
enabling access to the SSTs that are available to the 5G UE with
associated subscription.

The UE uses the list of PLMN/RAT combinations for PLMN selection, if
available, typically during roaming situations. In non-roaming
situations, the UE and subscription combination typically matches the
HPLMN/EHPLMN capabilities and policies, from a SST perspective. That is,
a 5G UE accessing its HPLMN/EHPLMN should be able to access SSTs
according to UE capabilities and the related subscription.

Optionally, a 5G system supports, subject to operator policies, a User
Controlled PLMN Selector list that enables the 5G UE user to specify
preferred PLMNs with associated access technology identifier in priority
order. The user may have obtained information about suitable PLMN/RAT
combination that would support services preferred by the user.

### 6.19.2 Requirements

The following set of requirements complement the requirements listed in
3GPP TS 22.011 \[3\], clause 3.2.

The 5G system shall support selection among any available PLMN/RAT
combinations, identified through their respective PLMN identifier and
Radio Access Technology identifier, in a prioritised order. The priority
order may, subject to operator policies, be provisioned in an Operator
Controlled PLMN Selector lists with associated RAT identifiers, stored
in the 5G UE.

The 5G system shall support, subject to operator policies, a User
Controlled PLMN Selector list stored in the 5G UE, allowing the UE user
to specify preferred PLMNs with associated RAT identifier in priority
order.

6.20 eV2X aspects
-----------------

### 6.20.1 Description

The 3GPP system is expected to support various enhanced V2X scenarios.

Vehicles Platooning enables the vehicles to dynamically form a group
travelling together. All the vehicles in the platoon receive periodic
data from the leading vehicle, in order to carry on platoon operations.
This information allows the distance between vehicles to become
extremely small, i.e. the gap distance translated to time can be very
low (sub second). Platooning applications may allow the vehicles
following to be autonomously driven.

Advanced Driving enables semi-automated or fully-automated driving.
Longer inter-vehicle distance is assumed. Each vehicle and/or RSU shares
data obtained from its local sensors with vehicles in proximity, thus
allowing vehicles to coordinate their trajectories or manoeuvres. In
addition, each vehicle shares its driving intention with vehicles in
proximity. The benefits of this use case group are safer traveling,
collision avoidance, and improved traffic efficiency.

Extended Sensors enables the exchange of raw or processed data gathered
through local sensors or live video data among vehicles, Road Site
Units, UEs of pedestrians and V2X application servers. The vehicles can
enhance the perception of their environment beyond what their own
sensors can detect and have a more holistic view of the local situation.

Remote Driving enables a remote driver or a V2X application to operate a
remote vehicle for those passengers who cannot drive themselves or a
remote vehicle located in dangerous environments. For a case where
variation is limited and routes are predictable, such as public
transportation, driving based on cloud computing can be used. In
addition, access to cloud-based back-end service platform can be
considered for this use case group.

### 6.20.2 Requirements

The 3GPP system supports the transport of messages with different
performance requirements to support V2X scenarios. The associated
requirements are described in eV2X 3GPP TS 22.186 \[9\].

6.21 NG-RAN Sharing
-------------------

### 6.21.1 Description

The increased density of access nodes needed to meet future performance
objectives poses considerable challenges in deployment and acquiring
spectrum and antenna locations. RAN sharing is seen as a technical
solution to these issues.

### 6.21.2 Requirements

Requirements related to NG-RAN sharing are described in 3GPP TS 22.101
\[6\], clause 28.2.

6.22 Unified access control
---------------------------

### 6.22.1 Description

Depending on operator policies, deployment scenarios, subscriber
profiles, and available services, different criterion will be used in
determining which access attempt should be allowed or blocked when
congestion occurs in the 5G System. These different criteria for access
control are associated with Access Identities and Access Categories. The
5G system will provide a single unified access control where operators
control accesses based on these two.

In unified access control, each access attempt is categorized into one
or more of the Access Identities and one of the Access Categories. Based
on the access control information applicable for the corresponding
Access Identity and Access Category of the access attempt, the UE
performs a test whether the actual access attempt can be made or not.

The unified access control supports extensibility to allow inclusion of
additional standardized Access Identities and Access Categories and
supports flexibility to allow operators to define operator-defined
Access Categories using their own criterion (e.g. network slicing,
application, and application server).

NOTE1: Sections 4.1 through 4.4a of TS 22.011 are obsolete and replaced
by Section 6.22.2 of this specification. However, when a UE is
configured for EAB according to TS 22.011, the UE is also configured for
delay tolerant service for 5G system.

NOTE2: IAB-MT is not subject to unified access control

### 6.22.2 Requirements

#### 6.22.2.1 General

Based on operator's policy, the 5G system shall be able to prevent UEs
from accessing the network using relevant barring parameters that vary
depending on Access Identity and Access Category. Access Identities are
configured at the UE as listed in Table 6.22.2.2-1. Access Categories
are defined by the combination of conditions related to UE and the type
of access attempt as listed in Table 6.22.2.3-1. One or more Access
Identities and only one Access Category are selected and tested for an
access attempt.

The 5G network shall be able to broadcast barring control information
(i.e. a list of barring parameters associated with an Access Identity
and an Access Category) in one or more areas of the RAN.

The UE shall be able to determine whether or not a particular new access
attempt is allowed based on barring parameters that the UE receives from
the broadcast barring control information and the configuration in the
UE.

In the case of multiple core networks sharing the same RAN, the RAN
shall be able to apply access control for the different core networks
individually.

The unified access control framework shall be applicable both to UEs
accessing the 5G CN using E-UTRA and to UEs accessing the 5G CN using
NR.

The unified access control framework shall be applicable to UEs in RRC
Idle, RRC Inactive, and RRC Connected at the time of initiating a new
access attempt (e.g. new session request).

NOTE 1: \"new session request\" in RRC Connected refers to events, e.g.
new MMTEL voice or video session, sending of SMS (SMS over IP, or SMS
over NAS), sending of IMS registration related signalling, new PDU
session establishment, existing PDU session modification, and service
request to re-establish the user plane for an existing PDU session.

The 5G system shall support means by which the operator can define
operator-defined Access Categories to be mutually exclusive.

NOTE 2: Examples of criterion of operator-defined Access Categories are
network slicing, application, and application server.

The unified access control framework shall be applicable to inbound
roamers to a PLMN.

The serving PLMN should be able to provide the definition of
operator-defined Access Categories to the UE.

Access Category 0 shall not be barred, irrespective of Access
Identities.

NOTE: The network can control the amount of access attempts relating to
Access Category 0 by controlling whether to send paging or not.

6.23 QoS Monitoring 
-------------------

### 6.23.1 Description 

The QoS requirements specified for particular services such as URLLC
services, vertical automation communication services, and V2X, mandate
QoS guarantees from the network. However, the network may not be able to
always guarantee the required QoS of the service. An example reason for
this shortcoming is that the latency and/or packet error rate increase
due to interference in a radio cell. In such cases, it is critical that
the application and/or application server is notified in a timely
manner. Hence, the 5G system should be able to support QoS
monitoring/assurance for URLLC services, V2X and vertical automation.

For more information on QoS assurance see Annex F.

Vertical automation systems are locally distributed and are typically
served by wired and wireless communication networks of different types
and with different characteristics. If the operation of the system or
one of its sub-processes does not work properly, there is a need for
quickly finding and eliminating the related error or fault in order to
avoid significant operation and thus financial losses. To that end,
automation devices and applications implement diagnosis and
error-analysis algorithms, as well as predictive maintenance features.

Due to their inherent challenges, wireless communication systems are
usually under suspicion in case an error occurs in a distributed
automation application. Therefore, diagnosis and fault analysis features
for 5G systems are required. The 5G system needs to provide sufficient
monitoring information as input for such diagnosis features.

QoS monitoring can be used for the following activities:

\- assessing and assuring the dependability of network operation;

\- assessing and assuring the dependability of the communication
services;

\- excluding particular communication errors;

\- identifying communication errors;

\- analysing the location of an error including the geographic location
of the involved network component (UE; front-haul component; core node);

\- activation of application-related countermeasures.

### 6.23.2 Requirements

The 5G system shall provide a mechanism for supporting real time E2E QoS
monitoring within a system.

The 5G network shall provide an interface to application for QoS
monitoring (e.g. to initiate QoS monitoring, request QoS parameters,
events, logging information, etc.).

The 5G system shall be able to provide real time QoS parameters and
events information to an authorized application/network entity.

NOTE: The QoS parameters to be monitored and reported can include
latency (e.g. UL/DL or round trip), jitter, and packet loss rate.

The 5G system shall be able to log the history of the communication
events. This includes for examples parts of the SLA that are not met,
timestamp of the events, and event position (e.g. UEs and radio access
points associated with the events).

The 5G system shall support different levels of granularity for QoS
monitoring (e.g. per flow or set of flows).

The 5G system shall be able to provide event notification upon detecting
an error that the negotiated QoS level cannot be met/guaranteed.

The 5G system shall be able to provide information that identifies the
type and the location of a communication error. (e.g. cell id).

The 5G system shall be able to provide notification of communication
events to authorized entities per pre-defined patterns (e.g. every time
the bandwidth drops below a pre-defined threshold for QoS parameters the
authorized entity is notified and event is logged).

The 5G system shall be able to respond to a request from an authorized
entity to provide real-time QoS monitoring information within a
specified time after receiving the request (e.g. within 5s).

The 5G system shall support an update/refresh rate for real time QoS
monitoring within a specified time (e.g. at least 1 per second).

The 5G system shall be able to provide statistical information of
service parameters and error types while a communication service is in
operation.

The 5G system shall provide information on the current availability of a
specific communication service in a particular area (e.g. cell id) upon
request of an authorized entity.

6.24 Ethernet transport services
--------------------------------

### 6.24.1 Description

This clause includes common, fundamental Ethernet transport
requirements, and any requirements necessary to support a 5G LAN-type
service. The requirements applicable to the 5G system for supporting
cyber-physical applications using Ethernet are described in 3GPP TS
22.104 \[21\].

### 6.24.2 Requirements

6.25 Non-public networks
------------------------

### 6.25.1 Description

Non-public networks are intended for the sole use of a private entity
such as an enterprise, and may be deployed in a variety of
configurations, utilising both virtual and physical elements.
Specifically, they may be deployed as completely standalone networks,
they may be hosted by a PLMN, or they may be offered as a slice of a
PLMN.

In any of these deployment options, it is expected that unauthorized
UEs, those that are not associated with the enterprise, will not attempt
to access the non-public network, which could result in resources being
used to reject that UE and thereby not be available for the UEs of the
enterprise. It is also expected that UEs of the enterprise will not
attempt to access a network they are not authorized to access. For
example, some enterprise UEs may be restricted to only access the
non-public network of the enterprise, even if PLMN coverage is available
in the same geographic area. Other enterprise UEs may be able to access
both a non-public network and a PLMN where specifically allowed.

### 6.25.2 Requirements

network, i.e. a non-public network may be able to operate without
dependency on a PLMN.

Subject to an agreement between the operators and service providers,
operator policies and the regional or national regulatory requirements,
the 5G system shall support for non-public network subscribers:

\- access to subscribed PLMN services via the non-public network;

\- seamless service continuity for subscribed PLMN services between a
non-public network and a PLMN;

\- access to selected non-public network services via a PLMN;

\- seamless service continuity for non-public network services between a
non-public network and a PLMN.

A non-public network subscriber to access a PLMN service shall have a
service subscription using 3GPP identifiers and credentials provided or
accepted by a PLMN.

The 5G system shall support a mechanism for a UE to identify and select
a non-public network.

NOTE: Different network selection mechanisms may be used for physical vs
virtual non-public networks.

The 5G system shall support identifiers for a large number of non-public
networks to minimize collision likelihood between assigned identifiers.

The 5G system shall support a mechanism to prevent a UE with a
subscription to a non-public network from automatically selecting and
attaching to a PLMN or non-public network it is not authorized to
select.

The 5G system shall support a mechanism to prevent a UE with a
subscription to a PLMN from automatically selecting and attaching to a
non-public network it is not authorized to select.

The 5G system shall support a mechanism for a PLMN to control whether a
user of a UE can manually select a non-public network hosted by this
PLMN that the UE is not authorized to select automatically.

The 5G system may broadcast a human readable network name that a UE may
display for manual selection of a non-public network.

The 5G system shall support a change of host of a non-public network
from one PLMN to another PLMN without changing the network selection
information stored in the UEs of the non-public network.

6.26 5G LAN-type service
------------------------

### 6.26.1 Description

5G expands the scope and reach of 3GPP-defined technologies. There are
multiple market segments in the realm of residential, office, enterprise
and factory, where 5G will need to provide services with similar
functionalities to Local Area Networks (LANs) and VPN's but improved
with 5G capabilities (e.g. high performance, long distance access,

6.27 Positioning services
-------------------------

### 6.27.1 Description

5G positioning services aims to support verticals and applications with
positioning accuracies better than 10 meters, thus more accurate than
the ones of TS 22.071 \[24\] for LCS. High accuracy positioning is
characterized by ambitious system requirements for positioning accuracy
in many verticals and applications, including regulatory needs.

In Location-Based-Services and eHealth, higher accuracy is instrumental
to new services and applications, both outdoor and indoor.

For example, on the factory floor, it is important to locate assets and
moving objects such as forklifts, or parts to be assembled. Similar
needs exist in transportation and logistics, for example rail, road and
use of UAVs. In some road user cases, UE\'s supporting V2X
application(s) are also applicable to such needs. In cases such as
guided vehicles (e.g. industry, UAVs) and positioning of objects
involved in safety-related functions, availability needs to be very
high.

Mission Critical Organizations require mission critical services to have
accurate positioning such that first responders may be located at all
times during normal and critical operations, indoors as well as
outdoors. The level of positioning accuracy (and other KPIs) required is
much more stringent than that required by local and regional regulatory
requirements for commercial 5G users.

### 6.27.2 Requirements

The 5G system shall provide 5G positioning services in compliance with
regulatory requirements.

NOTE 1: example of regulatory requirements encompasses requirements on
emergency calls (e.g. e911), reliability and safety requirement (RAMS)
applicable to some use cases and verticals, implementation of Priority,
Precedence, Preemption (PPP) mechanisms to ensure sufficient reliability
metrics are reached, etc.

The 5G system shall provide different 5G positioning services, supported
by different single and hybrid positioning methods to supply absolute
and relative positioning.

NOTE 2: hybrid positioning methods include both the combination of 3GPP
positioning technologies and the combination of 3GPP positioning
technologies with non-3GPP positioning technologies such as, for
instance, GNSS (e.g. Beidou, Galileo, GPS, Glonass), Network-based
Assisted GNSS and High-Accuracy GNSS, Terrestrial Beacon Systems,
dead-reckoning sensors (e.g. IMU, barometer), WLAN/Bluetooth-based
positioning.

The 5G system shall enable an MCX UE to use the 5G positioning services
to determine its position with the associated uncertainty/confidence of
the position, on request, triggered by an event or periodically.

The 5G System shall be able to provide the 5G positioning services in
case of roaming.

The 5G system shall support mechanisms to determine the UE's
position-related data for period when the UE is outside the coverage of
3GPP RAT-dependent positioning technologies but within the 5G
positioning service area (e.g. within the coverage of satellite access).

The 5G system shall be able to make the position-related data available
to an application or to an application server existing within the PLMN,
external to the PLMN, or in the User Equipment.

NOTE 3: the position service latency can be tailored to the use cases.

The 5G system shall be able to manage and log position-related data in
compliance with applicable traceability, authentication and security
regulatory requirements.

The 5G system shall be able to request the UE to provide its
position-related-data on request, triggered by an event or periodically
and to request the UE to stop providing its position-related data
periodically.

NOTE 4: This requirement does not preclude whether the position is
computed in the UE or elsewhere in the 5G System (e.g. core network).

The 5G system shall support mechanisms to configure dynamically the
update rate of the position-related data to fulfil different
performances (e.g. power consumption, position service latency, etc.) or
different location modes.

NOTE 5: for example, the 5G System needs to be able to request the UE to
provide its location periodically with an update rate ranging from one
location every \[1 s-10 s\] in location normal mode to one location
every \[30 s-300 s, or more\] in location power saving mode. The 5G
System needs to allow UEs to sleep for extended periods (e.g. one week),
without requiring the UE to update its position data.

The 5G system shall allow the UE to trigger a different update rate of
the position-related data based on whether the UE is moving or not.

The 5G system shall be able to determine the position-related data of
the 5G positioning services with any update rate ranging from one set of
position-related data every 0.1 s to one set of position-related data
every month.

NOTE 6: the position service latency can be tailored to the use cases.

The 5G System shall be able to negotiate the positioning methods
according to the operator's policy or the application's requirements or
the user's preferences and shall support mechanisms to allow the network
or the UE to trigger this negotiation.

The 5G system shall supply a method for the operator to configure and
manage different positioning services for different users.

The 5G system shall be able to determine the reliability, and the
uncertainty or confidence level, of the position-related data.

The 5G system shall be able to access to the positioning methods used
for calculating the position-related data and to the associated
uncertainty/confidence indicators.

6.28 Cyber-physical control applications in vertical domains
------------------------------------------------------------

### 6.28.1 Description

The 5G system is expected to meet the service requirements for
cyber-physical control applications in vertical domains.

A vertical domain is a particular industry or group of enterprises in
which similar products or services are developed, produced, and
provided. Automation refers to the control of processes, devices, or
systems in vertical domains by automatic means. The main control
functions of automated control systems include taking measurements,
comparing results, computing any detected or anticipated errors, and
correcting the process to avoid future errors. These functions are
performed by sensors, transmitters, controllers, and actuators.

Cyber-physical systems are to be understood as systems that include
engineered, interacting networks of physical and computational
components. Cyber-physical control applications are to be understood as
applications that control physical processes. Cyber-physical control
applications in automation follow certain activity patterns, which are
open-loop control, closed-loop control, sequence control, and batch
control.

Communication services supporting cyber-physical control applications
need to be ultra-reliable, dependable with a high communication service
availability, and often require low or (in some cases) very low
end-to-end latency.

Communication in automation in vertical domains follows certain
communication patterns. The most well-known is periodic deterministic
communication, others are a-periodic deterministic communication and
non-deterministic communication.

Communication for cyber-physical control applications supports operation
in various vertical domains, for instance industrial automation and
energy automation.

### 6.28.2 Requirements

The 5G system supports the communication services for cyber-physical
control applications in the vertical domains of factories of the future
(smart manufacturing), electric power distribution, central power
generation, and rail-bound mass transit. The associated requirements are
described in 3GPP TS 22.104 \[21\].

6.29 Messaging aspects
----------------------

### 6.29.1 Description

The 5G system is expected to support advanced capabilities and
performance of messaging service especially for massive IoT
communication which are introduced by the MSGin5G Service \[x\]. The
MSGin5G Service provides one to one, group and broadcast message
services for thing-to-thing and person-to-thing communication with low
end-to-end delay and high reliability of message delivery, in a resource
efficient manner to optimize the resource usage of the both control
plane and user plane in the network, and power saving in the user
devices.

### 6.29.2 Requirements

The 5G system supports the MSGin5G Service. The associated service level
requirements of the MSGin5G Service are described in 3GPP TS 22.262
\[22\].

7 Performance requirements
==========================

7.1 High data rates and traffic densities
-----------------------------------------

Several scenarios require the support of very high data rates or traffic
densities of the 5G system. The scenarios address different service
areas: urban and rural areas, office and home, and special deployments
(e.g. massive gatherings, broadcast, residential, and high-speed
vehicles). The scenarios and their performance requirements can be found
in table 7.1-1.

\- Urban macro -- The general wide-area scenario in urban area

\- Rural macro -- The general wide-area scenario in rural area

\- Indoor hotspot -- The scenario for offices and homes, and residential
deployments.

\- Broadband access in a crowd -- The scenario for very dense crowds,
for example, at stadiums or concerts. In addition to a very high
connection density the users want to share what they see and hear,
putting a higher requirement on the uplink than the downlink.

\- Dense urban -- The scenario for pedestrian users, and users in urban
vehicles, for example, in offices, city centres, shopping centres, and
residential areas. The users in vehicles can be connected either
directly or via an onboard base station to the network.

\- Broadcast-like services -- The scenario for stationary users,
pedestrian users, and users in vehicles, for example, in offices, city
centres, shopping centres, residential areas, rural areas and in high
speed trains. The passengers in vehicles can be connected either
directly or via an onboard base station to the network.

\- High-speed train -- The scenario for users in trains. The users can
be connected either directly or via an onboard base station to the
network.

\- High-speed vehicle -- The scenario for users in road vehicles. The
users can be connected either directly or via an onboard base station to
the network.

\- Airplanes connectivity -- The scenario for users in airplanes. The
users can be connected either directly or via an onboard base station to
the network.

density scenarios.

7.2 Low latency and high reliability
------------------------------------

### 7.2.1 Overview

Several scenarios require the support of very low latency and very high
communications service availability. Note that this implies a very high
reliability. The overall service latency depends on the delay on the
radio interface, transmission within the 5G system, transmission to a
server which may be outside the 5G system, and data processing. Some of
these factors depend directly on the 5G system itself, whereas for
others the impact can be reduced by suitable interconnections between
the 5G system and services or servers outside of the 5G system, for
example, to allow local hosting of the services.

### 7.2.2 Scenarios and KPIs 

Different deployments of URLLC capabilities will depend on the 3GPP
system being able to meet specific sets of KPIs with different values
and ranges applicable for each attribute. A common, yet flexible, 5G
approach to URLLC will enable the 5G system to meet the specific sets of
KPIs needed in a given implementation. To provide clear and precise
requirements for specific types of services, the corresponding KPI
requirements are included in other specifications as follows:

> \- Cyber-physical control applications in vertical domains can be
> found in 22.104 \[21\].
>
> \- V2X can be found in 22.186 \[9\].
>
> \- Rail communications can be found in 22.289 \[23\].

Some scenarios requiring very low latency and very high communication
service availability are described below:

\- Motion control -- Conventional motion control is characterised by
high requirements on the communications system regarding latency,
reliability, and availability. Systems supporting motion control are
usually deployed in geographically limited areas but may also be
deployed in wider areas (e.g. city- or country-wide networks), access to
them may be limited to authorized users, and they may be isolated from
networks or network resources used by other cellular customers.

\- Discrete automation -- Discrete automation is characterised by high
requirements on the communications system regarding reliability and
availability. Systems supporting discrete automation are usually
deployed in geographically limited areas, access to them may be limited
to authorized users, and they may be isolated from networks or network
resources used by other cellular customers.

\- Process automation -- Automation for (reactive) flows, e.g.
refineries and water distribution networks. Process automation is
characterized by high requirements on the communications system
regarding communication service availability. Systems supporting process
automation are usually deployed in geographically limited areas, access
to them is usually limited to authorized users, and it will usually be
served by non-public networks.

\- Automation for electricity distribution (mainly medium and high
voltage). Electricity distribution is characterized by high requirements
on the communications service availability. In contrast to the above use
cases, electricity distribution is deeply immersed into the public
space. Since electricity distribution is an essential infrastructure, it
will, as a rule, be served by non-public networks.

\- Wireless road-side infrastructure backhaul in intelligent transport
systems -- Automation solutions for the infrastructure supporting
street-based traffic. This use case addresses the connection of the
road-side infrastructure, e.g. road side units, with other
infrastructure, e.g. a traffic guidance system. As is the case for
automation electricity, the nodes are deeply immersed into the public
space.

\- Remote control -- Remote control is characterised by a UE being
operated remotely by a human or a computer. For example, Remote Driving
enables a remote driver or a V2X application to operate a remote vehicle
with no driver or a remote vehicle located in a dangerous environment.

\- Rail communications (e.g. railway, rail-bound mass transit) have been
using 3GPP based mobile communication (e.g. GSM-R) already for some
time, while there is still a driver on-board of the train. The next step
of the evolution will be providing fully automated train operation that
requires highly reliable communication with moderate latencies but at
very high speeds of up to 500km/h.

For specific requirements, refer to the specifications noted above
\[21\], \[9\], \[23\].

### 7.2.3 Other requirements

#### 7.2.3.1 AR/VR

Audio-visual interaction is characterised by a human being interacting
with the environment or people, or controlling a UE, and relying on
audio-visual feedback. In the use cases like VR and interactive
conversation the latency requirements include the latencies at the
application layer (e.g. codecs), which could be specified outside of
3GPP.

Due to the separate handling of the audio and video component, VR
audio-video synchronisation is critical in order to avoid having a
negative impact on the user experience (i.e. viewers detecting lack of
synchronization), for example:

\- in the range of \[125 ms to 5 ms\] for audio delayed and

\- in the range of \[45 ms to 5 ms\] for audio advanced.

To support VR environments with low motion-to-photon capabilities, the
5G system shall support:

\- motion-to-photon latency in the range of 7-15ms while maintaining the
required user data rate of \[1Gbps\] and

\- motion-to-sound delay of \[\<20ms\].

NOTE: The motion-to-photon latency is defined as the latency between the
physical movement of a user\'s head and the updated picture in the VR
headset. The motion-to-sound latency is the latency between the physical
movement of a user\'s head and updated sound waves from a head mounted
speaker reaching their ears.

To support interactive task completion during voice conversations the 5G
system shall support low-delay speech coding for interactive
conversational services (100 ms, one-way mouth-to-ear).

#### 7.2.3.2 Wireless road-side infrastructure backhaul

Intelligent Transport Systems embrace a wide variety of
communications-related applications that are intended to increase travel
safety, minimize environmental impact, improve traffic management, and
maximize the benefits of transportation to both commercial users and the
general public.

Road-side infrastructure such as traffic light controllers, roadside
units, traffic monitoring in urban areas and along highways and streets
is wirelessly connected to traffic control centres for management and
control purposes. The backhaul communication between the road-side
infrastructure and the traffic control centre requires low-latency, high
communication service availability, and high-capacity connections for
reliable distribution of data. Road-side infrastructure is deployed
alongside streets in urban areas and alongside major roads and highways
every 1-2 km.

To support wireless road-side infrastructure backhaul the 5G system
shall support the performance requirements in table 7.2.3.2-1.

backhaul scenario

7.3 High accuracy positioning
-----------------------------

### 7.3.1 Description

Adaptability and flexibility are among the key features of the 5G system
to serve a wide diversity of verticals and services, in different
environments (e.g. rural, urban, indoor). This applies to high accuracy
positioning and translates into the ability to satisfy different levels
of services and requirements, for instance on performance (e.g.
accuracy, positioning service availability, positioning service latency)
and on functionality (e.g. security).

### 7.3.2 Requirements

#### 7.3.2.1 General

The 5G System shall provide different 5G positioning services with
configurable performances working points (e.g. accuracy, positioning
service availability, positioning service latency, energy consumption,
update rate, TTFF) according to the needs of users, operators and third
parties.

The 5G system shall support the combination of 3GPP and non-3GPP
positioning technologies to achieve performances of the 5G positioning
services better than those achieved using only 3GPP positioning
technologies.

NOTE 1: For instance, the combination of 3GPP positioning technologies
with non-3GPP positioning technologies such as for example GNSS (e.g.
Beidou, Galileo, GLONASS, and GPS), Terrestrial Beacon Systems (TBS),
sensors (e.g. barometer, IMU), WLAN/Bluetooth-based positioning, can
support the improvement of accuracy, positioning service availability,
reliability and/or confidence level, the reduction of positioning
service latency, the increase of the update rate of the position-related
data, increase the coverage (service area).

NOTE 2: The combination can vary over time to optimise the performances,
and can be the combination of multiple positioning technologies at the
same epoch and/or the combination of multiple positioning technologies
at different epochs.

The corresponding positioning information shall be acquired in a timely
fashion, be reliable, and be available (e.g. it is possible to determine
the position).

UEs shall be able to share positioning information between each other
e.g. to a controller if the location information cannot be processed or
used locally.

#### 7.3.2.2 Requirements for Horizontal and Vertical positioning service levels

The 5G system shall be able to provide positioning services with the
performances requirements reported in Table 7.3.2.2-1.

NOTE: The requirements do not preclude any type of UE, including
specific UE such as for example V2X, MTC.

positioning service levels

support mechanisms to provide a TTFF less than 10s.

NOTE 1: In some services, a TTFF of less than 10s may only be achievable
at the expense of a relaxation of some other performances (e.g.
horizontal accuracy may be 1 m or 3 m after 10 s TTFF, and reach a
steady state accuracy of 0.3 m after 30s).

The 5G system shall support a mechanism to determine the UE\'s velocity
with a positioning service availability of 99%, an accuracy better than
0.5 m/s for the speed and an accuracy better than 5 degree for the
3-Dimension direction of travel.

The 5G system shall support a mechanism to determine the UE\'s heading
with an accuracy better than 30 degrees (0.54 rad) and a positioning
service availability of 99.9 % for static users and with an accuracy
better than 10 degrees (0.17 rad) and a positioning service availability
of 99 % for users up to 10 km/h.

The 5G system shall support positioning technologies that allow the UE
to operate at Service Level 1 for at least 12 years using less than 1800
mWh of battery capacity, assuming multiple position updates per hour.

NOTE 2: This requirement aims energy-efficient positioning technologies
draining a minimal energy on the UE battery. It derives from use cases,
such as asset tracking, with a small form-factor battery representative
of an IoT device. This requirement may translate into an energy
consumption for the UE's positioning functions in the order of 20 mJ per
fix.

NOTE 3: This requirement does not preclude the use of higher energy
consumption to fulfil higher position update rates than the one above,
or other KPIs than those of Service Level 1 (e.g. more accurate service
levels).

8 Security
==========

8.1 Description
---------------

IoT introduces new UEs with different life cycles, including IoT devices
with no user interface (e.g. embedded sensors), long life spans during
which an IoT device may change ownership several times (e.g. consumer
goods), and which may not be pre-provisioned (e.g. consumer goods).
These drive a need for secure mechanisms to dynamically establish or
refresh credentials and subscriptions. New access technologies,
including licensed and unlicensed, 3GPP and non-3GPP, drive a need for
access independent security that is seamlessly available while the IoT
device is active. High-end smartphones, UAVs, and factory automation
drive a need for protection against theft and fraud. A high level of 5G
security is essential for critical communication, e.g. in industrial
automation, industrial IoT, and the Smart Grid. Expansion into
enterprise, vehicular, and public safety markets drive a need for
increased end user privacy protection. 5G security addresses all of
these new needs while continuing to provide security consistent with
prior 3GPP systems.

8.2 General
-----------

The 5G system shall support a secure mechanism to store cached data.

The 5G system shall support a secure mechanism to access a content
caching application.

The 5G system shall support a secure mechanism to access a service or an
application in an operator\'s Service Hosting Environment.

The 5G system shall enable support of an access independent security
framework.

The 5G system shall support a mechanism for the operator to authorize
subscribers of other PLMNs to receive temporary service (e.g. mission
critical services).

The 5G system shall be able to provide temporary service for authorized
users without access to their home network (e.g. IOPS, mission critical
services).

The 5G system shall allow the operator to authorize a third party to
create, modify and delete network slices, subject to an agreement
between the third party and the network operator.

Subject to HPLMN policy as well as its service and operational needs,
any USIM able to access EPS instead of a 5G USIM may be used to
authenticate a user in a 5G system to access supported services
according to the user's subscription.

The 5G system shall provide integrity protection and confidentiality for
communications between authorized UEs using a 5G LAN-type service.

The 5G LAN-VN shall be able to verify the identity of a UE requesting to
join a specific private communication.

The 5G system shall provide suitable APIs to allow use of a trusted
third party provided encryption between any UE served by a private slice
and a core network entity in that private slice.

8.3 Authentication
------------------

The 5G system shall support an efficient means to authenticate a user to
an IoT device (e.g. biometrics).

The 5G system shall be able to support authentication over a non-3GPP
access technology using 3GPP credentials.

The 5G system shall support operator controlled alternative
authentication methods (i.e. alternative to AKA) with different types of
credentials for network access for IoT devices in isolated deployment
scenarios (e.g. for industrial automation).

The 5G system shall support a suitable framework (e.g. EAP) allowing
alternative (e.g. to AKA) authentication methods with non-3GPP
identities and credentials to be used for UE network access
authentication in non-public networks.

NOTE 2: Non-public networks can use 3GPP authentication methods,
identities, and credentials for a UE to access network. Non-public
networks are also allowed to utilize non-AKA based authentication
methods such as provided by the EAP framework, for which the credentials
can be stored in the ME.

Subject to an agreement between an MNO and a third party, the 5G system
shall support a mechanism for the PLMN to authenticate and authorize UEs
for access to both a hosted non-public network and private slice(s) of
the PLMN associated with the hosted non-public network.

The 5G network shall support a 3GPP supported mechanism to authenticate
legacy non-3GPP devices for 5G LAN-VN access.

The 5G system shall support a mechanism for the non-public network to
authenticate and authorize UEs for access to network slices of that
non-public network.

8.4 Authorization
-----------------

The 5G system shall allow the operator to authorize an IoT device to use
one or more 5G system features that are restricted to IoT devices.

The 5G system shall allow the operator to authorize /de-authorize UEs
for using 5G LAN-type service.

NOTE: when a UE is de-authorized from using 5G LAN-type service, it is
removed from all 5G LAN-VNs.

Based on operator policy, before establishing a direct device connection
using a non-3GPP access technology, IoT devices may use 3GPP credentials
to determine if they are authorized to engage in direct device
connection.

Based on operator policy, the 5G system shall provide a means to verify
whether a UE is authorized to use prioritized network access for a
specific service.

8.5 Identity management
-----------------------

The 5G system shall provide a mechanism for an operator to allow access
from a UE using a temporary identifier that hides its subscriber
identity.

The HPLMN shall be able to associate a temporary identifier to a UE\'s
subscriber identity.

The 5G system shall be able to protect subscriber identity and other
user identifying information from passive attacks.

Subject to regional or national regulatory requirements, the 5G system
shall be able to protect subscriber identity and other user identifying
information from active attacks.

The 5G system shall be able to allow the equipment identifier to be
collected by legitimate entity regardless of UE\'s user interface, when
required.

The 5G system shall be able to support identification of subscriptions
independently of identification of equipment.

The 5G system shall support a secure mechanism to collect system
information while ensuring end-user and application privacy (e.g.
application level information is not to be related to an individual user
identity or subscriber identity and UE information is not to be related
to an individual subscriber identity).

Subject to regional or national regulatory requirements, the 5G system
shall be able to provide the 5G positioning services while ensuring the
protection of the privacy of the UE's user or owner, including the
respect of his consent to the positioning services.

NOTE 1: this includes the ability for the 5G system to provide the
positioning services on demand without having to track continuously the
position of the involved UE.

NOTE 2: the respect of the user's consent to some positioning services
could abide by different rules in case of emergency (for example, rules
that would also receive consent from the user, but well before the
emergency occurs).

For a private network using 5G technology, the 5G system shall support
network access using identities, credentials, and authentication methods
provided and managed by a third party and supported by 3GPP.

8.6 Regulatory
--------------

The 5G system shall support regional or national regulatory requirements
for all supported access networks.

The 5G system shall support Lawful Intercept subject to regional or
national regulatory requirements.

A 5G system shall support regulatory requirements for 5G LAN-type
services.

8.7 Fraud protection
--------------------

Subject to regional or national regulatory requirements, the 5G system
shall support a secure mechanism for allowing an authorized entity to
disable from normal operation of a UE reported as stolen.

Subject to regional or national regulatory requirements, the 5G system
shall support a secure mechanism for allowing an authorized entity to
re-enable a recovered stolen UE to normal operation.

The 5G system shall be able to protect user location information from
passive attacks.

Subject to regional or national regulatory requirements, the 5G system
shall be able to protect user location information from active attacks.

Subject to regional or national regulatory requirements, the 5G system
shall support mechanisms to protect the production of the user location
information and user positioning-related data against tampering and
spoofing.

Subject to regional or national regulatory requirements, the 5G system
shall support mechanisms to detect tampering and spoofing attempts on
the production of the user location information and the user
position-related data.

8.8 Resource efficiency
-----------------------

The 5G system shall minimize security signalling overhead without
compromising the security level of the 3GPP system.

The 5G system shall support an efficient secure mechanism to transmit
the same data (e.g. service provisioning multiple sensors) to multiple
UEs.

8.9 Data security and privacy
-----------------------------

The 5G system shall support data integrity protection and
confidentiality methods that serve URLLC and energy constrained devices.

The 5G system shall support a mechanism to verify the integrity of a
message as well as the authenticity of the sender of the message.

The 5G system shall support encryption for URLLC services within the
requested end-to-end latency.

9 Charging aspects

######## Annex C (informative): Relation of communication service availability and reliability

Communication service availability and reliability are well known terms
used not only within 3GPP but also in vertical industries (IEC 61907
\[12\]). Communication service availability addresses the availability
of a communication service, in vertical applications usually in
accordance to IEC 61907 \[12\]. Reliability addresses the availability
of the communication network. The relation of both terms is depicted in
figure C-1.

![](media/image3.wmf){width="6.6875in" height="1.84375in"}

Figure C-1: Illustration of the concepts communication service
availability and reliability.

As depicted, reliability covers the communication-related aspects
between two nodes (here: end nodes), while communication service
availability addresses the communication-related aspects between two
communication service interfaces. In other words, the \"gap\" between
both concepts is the communication interface. This might seem to be a
small difference, but this difference can lead to situations, where
reliability and communication service availability have different
values.

**Example: traffic gets \"stuck\"**

The related scenario is depicted in figure C-2.

![](media/image4.wmf){width="6.692361111111111in"
height="2.792361111111111in"}

Figure C-2: Example in which communication service availability and
reliability have different values. Packets are reliably transmitted from
the communication service interface A to end node B, but they are not
exposed at the communication service interface B.

This scenario addresses unicast communication from application A to B.
The packets are handed over from the application to the communication
network at the communication service interface A, and the packets are
then transmitted to the end node B. In this example, the packets
received by end node B are not exposed at the communication service
interface B. So, even if all packets that are handed over to end node A
are successfully delivered to end node B within the time constraint
required by the targeted service, i.e. even if the reliability is 100%,
the communication service availability is 0% since no packets arrive at
the \"end\", i.e. the communication service interface B.

**Example: less capacity than agreed**

**The related scenario is depicted in figure C-3.**

![](media/image5.wmf){width="6.697916666666667in"
height="2.6770833333333335in"}

Figure C-3: Example in which communication service availability and
reliability have different values. Only half of the packets handed over
to the end node A are actually transmitted to end node B and handed over
to application B at the communication service interface B.

This scenario describes unicast communication of evenly interspersed
packets from application A to B. The packets are handed over from the
application to the communication network at the communication service
interface A, and the packets are then transmitted to the end node B.
However, only every second packet is actually successfully handed over
to end node A and then transmitted to end node B. Thus, only half of the
packets arrive at application B. Note though that the reliability of the
mobile network is 100%, since all packets transmitted by end node A are
delivered to end node B within the time constraint required by the
targeted service. However, depending on the agreed QoS, the
communication service availability can be of the same value as the
reliability or much lower. For instance, if the agreed survival time is
larger than the time between three packets at the communication service
interface A, communication service availability and reliability have the
same value. However, if―due to the loss of packets at the communication
service interface A―the effective bandwidth between application A and B
is lower than the agreed value, the communication service availability
is 0%.

Note that the shortest time interval over which the communication
service availability should be calculated is the sum of maximum allowed
end-to-end latency and survival time.

**Example: heterogeneous network**

**The related scenario is depicted in figure C-4.**

![](media/image6.wmf){width="6.697916666666667in"
height="1.8333333333333333in"}

Figure C-4: Example in which communication service availability and
reliability have different values. Packets are delivered over a daisy
chain of a mobile network and another network (e.g. IEEE 802.11n based).
Reliability is evaluated for the mobile network only, while
communication service availability depends on the performance of both
networks.

This scenario is not in scope for this specification, since it pertains
to the particular deployment of a mobile network, but we discuss it
nonetheless, as this example provides valuable insight for network
operators.

This scenario describes unicast communication from application A to B.
The packets are handed over from the application to the communication
network at the communication service interface A, and the packets are
then transmitted to the end node B. In this example, the packets are
transmitted over two daisy-chained networks―one mobile network according
to 3GPP specifications, and another network, e.g. a network based on
IEEE 802.11n. As in the other examples above, communication service
availability is measured between the two communication service
interfaces, but the reliability is only measured between end node A and
the router node. This has implications for, e.g. the maximum
communication latency allowed for each network. In case the agreed
end-to-end latency between the service interfaces is, for instance, 100
ms, and the 802.11n network has a latency of 30 ms, the maximum
allowable latency for packages in the mobile network is 70 ms (NOTE).
So, if the latency in the mobile network exceeds 70 ms, the
communication service availability is 0%, despite the agreed QoS
stipulating a larger end-to-end latency, i.e. 100 ms.

NOTE: The transit time through the router node is not considered here.
It is assumed to be very small and much less than 100 ms.

######## Annex D (informative): Critical-communication use cases

D.1 Discrete automation -- motion control
-----------------------------------------

Industrial factory automation requires communications for closed-loop
control applications. Examples for such applications are motion control
of robots, machine tools, as well as packaging and printing machines.
All other discrete-automation applications are addressed in Annex D.2.

The corresponding industrial communication solutions are referred to as
fieldbuses. The pertinent standard suite is IEC 61158. Note that clock
synchronization is an integral part of fieldbuses used for motion
control.

In motion control applications, a controller interacts with a large
number of sensors and actuators (e.g. up to 100), which are integrated
in a manufacturing unit. The resulting sensor/actuator density is often
very high (up to 1 m^-3^). Many such manufacturing units may have to be
supported within close proximity within a factory (e.g. up to 100 in
automobile assembly line production).

In a closed-loop control application, the controller periodically
submits instructions to a set of sensor/actuator devices, which return a
response within a cycle time. The messages, referred to as telegrams,
are typically small (≤ 56 bytes). The cycle time can be as low as 2 ms,
setting stringent end-to-end latency constraints on telegram forwarding
(1 ms). Additional constraints on isochronous telegram delivery add
tight constraints on jitter (1 μs), and the communication service has
also to be highly available (99,9999%).

Multi-robot cooperation is a case in closed-loop control where a group
of robots collaborate to conduct an action, for example, symmetrical
welding of a car body to minimize deformation. This requires isochronous
operation between all robots. For multi-robot cooperation, the jitter
(1µs) is among the command messages of a control event to the group
robots.

To meet the stringent requirements of closed-loop factory automation,
the following considerations may have to be taken:

\- Limitation to short-range communications.

\- Use of direct device connection between the controller and actuators.

\- Allocation of licensed spectrum for closed-loop control operations.
Licensed spectrum may further be used as a complement to unlicensed
spectrum, e.g. to enhance reliability.

\- Reservation of dedicated air-interface resources for each link.

\- Combination of multiple diversity techniques to approach the high
reliability target within stringent end-to-end latency constraints such
as frequency, antenna, and various forms of spatial diversity, e.g. via
relaying

\- Utilizing OTA time synchronization to satisfy jitter constraints for
isochronous operation.

A typical industrial closed-loop motion control application is based on
individual control events. Each closed-loop control event consists of a
downlink transaction followed by a synchronous uplink transaction, both
of which are executed within a cycle time. Control events within a
manufacturing unit may have to occur isochronously. Factory automation
considers application-layer transaction cycles between controller
devices and sensor/actuator devices. Each transaction cycle consists of
(1) a command sent by the controller to the sensor/actuator (downlink),
(2) application-layer processing on the sensor/actuator device, and (3)
a subsequent response by the sensor/actuator to the controller (uplink).
Cycle time includes the entire transaction from the transmission of a
command by the controller to the reception of a response by the
controller. It includes all lower layer processes and latencies on the
air interface as well the application-layer processing time on the
sensor/actuator.

factory units. Step 1 (red): controller requests sensor data (or an
actuator to conduct actuation) from the sensor/actuator (S/A). Step 2
(blue): sensor sends measurement information (or acknowledges actuation)
to controller.

Figure D.1-1 depicts how communication may occur in factory automation.
In this use case, communication is confined to local
controller-to-sensor/actuator interaction within each manufacturing
unit. Repeaters may provide spatial diversity to enhance reliability.

### D.1.1 Service area and connection density

The maximum service volume in motion control is currently set by
hoisting solutions, i.e. cranes, and by the manipulation of large
machine components, e.g. propeller blades of wind-energy generators.
Cranes can be rather wide and quite high above the shop floor, even
within a factory hall. In addition, they typically travel along an
entire factory hall.

An approximate dimension of the service area is 100 x 100 x 30 m.

Note that production cells are commonly much smaller (\< 10 x 10 x 3 m).
There are typically about 10 motion-control connections in a production
cell, which results in a connection density of up to 10^5^ km^-2^.

### D.1.2 Security

Network access and authorization in an industrial factory deployment is
typically provided and managed by the factory owner with its ID
management, authentication, confidentiality and integrity.

Note that motion control telegrams usually are not encrypted due to
stringent cycle time requirements.

A comprehensive security framework for factories has been described in
IEC 62443.

D.2 Discrete automation
-----------------------

Discrete automation encompasses all types of production that result in
discrete products: cars, chocolate bars, etc. Automation that addresses
the control of flows and chemical reactions is referred to as process
automation (see clause D.3). Discrete automation requires communications
for supervisory and open-loop control applications, as well as process
monitoring and tracking operations inside an industrial plant. In these
applications, a large number of sensors distributed over the plant
forward measurement data to process controllers on a periodic or
event-driven base. Traditionally, wireline field bus technologies have
been used to interconnect sensors and control equipment. Due to the
sizable extension of a plant (up to10 km^2^), the large number of
sensors, rotary joints, and the high deployment complexity of wired
infrastructure, wireless solutions have made inroads into industrial
process automation.

This use case requires support of a large number of sensor devices per
plant as well as high communication service availability (99,99%).
Furthermore, power consumption is relevant since some sensor devices are
battery-powered with a targeted battery lifetime of several years while
providing measurement updates every few seconds. Range also becomes a
critical factor due to the low transmit power levels of the sensors, the
large size of the plant and the high reliability requirements on
transport. End-to-end latency requirements typically range between 10 ms
and 1 s. User experienced data rates can be rather low since each
transaction typically comprises less than 256 bytes. However, there has
been a shift from field busses featuring somewhat modest data rates (\~
2 Mbps) to those with higher data rates (\~ 10 Mbps) due to the
increasing number of distributed applications and also \"data-hungry\"
applications. An example for the latter is the visual control of
production processes. For this application, the user experienced data
rate is typically around 10 Mbps and the transmitted packets are much
larger.

The existing wireless technologies rely on unlicensed bands.
Communication is therefore vulnerable to interference caused by other
technologies (e.g. WLAN). With the stringent requirements on transport
reliability, such interference is detrimental to proper operation.

The use of licensed spectrum could overcome the vulnerability to
same-band interference and therefore enable higher reliability.
Utilization of licensed spectrum can be confined to those events where
high interference bursts in unlicensed bands jeopardizes reliability and
end-to-end latency constraints. This allows sharing the licensed
spectrum between process automation and conventional mobile services.

Multi-hop topologies can provide range extension and mesh topologies can
increase reliability through path redundancy. Clock synchronization will
be highly beneficial since it enables more power-efficient sensor
operation and mesh forwarding.

The corresponding industrial communication solutions are referred to as
fieldbuses. The related standard suite is IEC 61158.

A typical discrete automation application supports downstream and
upstream data flows between process controllers and sensors/actuators.
The communication consists of individual transactions. The process
controller resides in the plant network. This network interconnects via
base stations to the wireless (mesh-) network which hosts the
sensor/actuator devices. Typically, each transaction uses less than 256
bytes. An example of a controller-initiated transaction service flow is:

1\. The process controller requests sensor data (or an actuator to
conduct actuation). The request is forwarded via the plant network and
the wireless network to the sensors/actuators.

2\. The sensors/actuators process the request and send a replay in
upstream direction to the controller. This reply may contain an
acknowledgement or a measurement reading.

An example of a sensor/actuator device initiated transaction service
flow:

1\. The sensor sends a measurement reading to the process controller.
The request is forwarded via the wireless (mesh) network and the plant
network.

2\. The process controller may send an acknowledgement in opposite
direction.

For both controller- and sensor/actuator-initiated service flows,
upstream and downstream transactions may occur asynchronously.

Figure D.2-1 depicts how communication may occur in discrete automation.
In this use case, communication runs between process controller and
sensor/actuator device via the plant network and the wireless (mesh)
network. The wireless (mesh) network may also support access for
handheld devices for supervisory control or process monitoring purposes.

### D.2.1 Service area and connection density

Factory halls can be rather large and even quite high. We set the upper
limit at 1000 x 1000 x 30 m. Note that the connection density might vary
quite a bit throughout factory halls. It is, for instance much higher
along an assembly line than in an overflow buffer. Also, the density
usually increases towards the factory floor. Typically, there is at
least one connection per 10 m^2^, which results in a connection density
of up to 10^5^ km^-2^.

### D.2.2 Security

Network access and authorization in an industrial factory deployment is
typically provided and managed by the factory owner with its ID
management, authentication, confidentiality and integrity.

A comprehensive security framework for factories has been described in
IEC 62443.

D.3 Process automation
----------------------

Process automation has much in common with discrete automation (see
Annex D.2). Instead of discrete products (cars, chocolate bars, etc.),
process automation addresses the production of bulk products such as
petrol and reactive gases. In contrast to discrete automation, motion
control is of limited or no importance. Typical end-to-end latencies are
50 ms. User experienced data rates, communication service availability,
and connection density vary noticeably between applications. Below we
describe one emerging use case (remote control via mobile computational
units, see Annex D.3.1) and a contemporary use case (monitoring, see
Annex D.3.2).

Note that discrete automation fieldbuses (see Annex D.2) are also used
in process automation.

### D.3.1 Remote control

Some of the interactions within a plant are conducted by automated
control applications similar to those described in Annex D.2. Here too,
sensor output is requested in a cyclic fashion, and actuator commands
are sent via the communication network between a controller and the
actuator. Furthermore, there is an emerging need for the control of the
plant from personnel on location. Typically, monitoring and managing of
distributed control systems takes place in a dedicated control room.

Staff deployment to the plant itself occurs, for instance, during
construction and commissioning of a plant and in the start-up phase of
the processes. In this scenario, the locally deployed staff taps into
the same real-time data as provided to the control room. These remote
applications require high data rates (\~ 100 Mps) since the staff on
location needs to view inaccessible locations with high definition (e.g.
emergency valves) and since their colleagues in the control room benefit
from high-definition footage from body cameras (HD or even 4K).

For both kinds of applications, a very high communication service
availability is needed (99,9999%). Typically, only a few control loops
are fully automated and only handful of control personnel is deployed on
location, so that the connection density is rather modest (\~ 1000
km^-2^).

### D.3.2 Monitoring

The monitoring of states, e.g. the level of the liquid of process
reactors, is a paramount task. Due to the ever changing states,
measurement data is either pulled or pushed from the sensors in a cyclic
manner. Some sensors are more conveniently accessed via wireless links,
and monitoring via handheld terminals of these sensors during, e.g.
maintenance is also on the rise. This kind of application entails rather
modest user experienced data rates (\~ 1 Mps), and since this kind of
data is \"only\" indicator for, e.g. what process should be stopped in
order to avoid an overflow, and not for automated control loops, the
requirement on communication service availability is comparably low
(99,9%). Note that emergency valves and such typically are operated
locally and do not rely on communication networks. However, many sensors
are deployed in chemical plants etc., so that connection density can
readily reach 10 000 km^-2^.

### D.3.3 Service area

While, for instance, chemical plants and refineries readily can span
over several square kilometres, the dedicated control rooms are
typically only responsible for a subset of that area. Such subsets are
often referred to as plant, and their typical size is 300 x 300 x 50 m.

D.4 Electricity distribution 
----------------------------

### D.4.1 Medium voltage

An energy-automation domain that hitherto has only seen very little
application of mobile-network technology is the backhaul network, i.e.
the part of the distribution grid between primary substations (high
voltage  medium voltage) and secondary substations (medium voltage 
low voltage). In figure D.4.1-1 we depict a medium-voltage ring together
with energy-automation use cases that either are already deployed or are
anticipated within the near future.

![](media/image9.wmf){width="6.68125in" height="4.596527777777778in"}

Figure D.4.1-1: Functional, topological sketch of a medium-voltage ring.
AMI: advanced metering infrastructure; CB: circuit breaker; DMS:
distribution management system; FISR: fault isolation and system
restoration; HEM: home energy manager; PQ: power quality; RMU: ring main
unit.

The primary substation and the secondary substations are supervised and
controlled by a distribution-management system (DMS). If
energy-automation devices in the medium-voltage power line ring need to
communicate with each other and /or the DMS, a wireless backhaul network
needs to be present (orange \"cloud\" in Figure D.4.1-1).

A majority of applications in electricity distribution adhere to the
communication standard IEC 60870-5-104, however, its modern \"cousin\",
IEC 61850, experiences rapidly increasing popularity. The communication
requirements for IEC 61850 applications can be found in EC 61850-90-4.
Communication in wide-area networks is described in IEC 61850-90-12.

Usually, power line ring structures have to be open in order to avoid a
power-imbalance in the ring (green dot in the Figure). Examples for
energy-automation that already is implemented in medium-voltage grids
(albeit in low numbers) are power-quality measurements and the
measurement of secondary-substation parameters (temperature, power load,
etc.) \[13\]. Other use cases are demand response and the control of
distributed, renewable energy resources (e.g. photovoltaics).

A use case that could also be realised in the future is fault isolation
and system restoration (FISR). FISR automates the management of faults
in the distribution grid. It supports the localization of the fault, the
isolation of the fault, and the restoration of the energy delivery. For
this kind of automation, the pertinent sensors and actuators broadcast
telegrams about their states (e.g. \"emergency closer idle\") and about
actions (e.g. \"activating closer\") into the backhaul network. This
information is used by the ring main units (RMUs) as input for their
decision algorithms. We illustrate this use of automation telegrams for
an automated FISR event in figure D.4.1-1. Let us assume the
distribution lines are cut at the location indicated by the bolt of
lightning in the Figure. In that case, the RMUs between the bolt and the
green load switch (open) will be without power. The RMUs next to the
\"bolt\" automatically open their load switches after having sensed the
loss of electric connectivity between them. They both broadcast these
actions into the backhaul network. Typically, these telegrams are
repeated many times while the time between adjacent telegrams increases
exponentially. This communication patterns leads to sudden, distributed
surges in the consumed communication bandwidth. After the RMUs next to
the \"bolt\" have open their switch, the RMU that so far has kept the
power line ring open (green dot in figure D.4.1-1) close the load
switch. This event too is broadcasted into the backhaul network. The
typical maximum end-to-end latency for this kind of broadcast is 25 ms
with a peak experienced data rate of 10 Mbps. Note that the distribution
system typically subscribes to telegrams from all RMUs in order to keep
abreast with the happenings in the distribution grid.

Automatic fault handling in the distribution grid shortens outage time
and offloads the operators in the distribution control centre for more
complicated situations. Therefore, automated FISR may help to improve
performance indexes like System Average Interruption Duration Index and
System Average Interruption Frequency Index.

Automation telegrams are typically distributed via domain multicast. As
explained above, the related communication pattern can be \"bursty\",
i.e. only few automation telegrams are sent when the distribution
network operates nominally (\~ 1 kbps), but, for instance, a disruption
in the power line triggers a short-lived avalanche of telegrams from
related applications in the ring (≥ 1 Mbps).

#### D.4.1.1 Service area and connection density

Service coverage is only required along the medium-voltage line. In
Europe, the line often forms a loop (see figure D.4.1-1), while
deployments in other countries, e.g. the USA, tend to extend linearly
over distances up to \~ 100 km. The vertical dimension of the poles in a
medium voltages line is typically less than 40 m. Especially in urban
areas, the number of ring main units can be rather large (\> 10 km^-2^),
and the number of connections to each ring main unit is expected to
increase swiftly once economical, suitable wireless connectivity becomes
available. We predict connection densities of up to 1.000 km^-2^.

#### D.4.1.2 Security

Due to its central role in virtually every country on earth, electricity
distribution is heavily regulated. Security assessment for, e.g.
deployments in North America, need to adhere to the NERC CIP suite
\[14\]. Technical implementations are described in standard suites such
as IEC 62351.

### D.4.2 Energy distribution -- high voltage

In order to avoid region- or even nation-wide power outages, wide-area
power system protection is on the rise. \"When a major power system
disturbance occurs, protection and control actions are required to stop
the power system degradation, restore the system to a normal state and
minimize the impact of the disturbance. The present control actions are
not designed for a fast-developing disturbance and may be too slow.
Local protection systems are not able to consider the overall system,
which may be affected by the disturbance. Wide area disturbance
protection is a concept of using system-wide information and sending
selected local information to a remote location to counteract
propagation of the major disturbances in the power system.\" \[15\].
Protection actions include, \"among others, changes in demand (e.g. load
shedding), changes in generation or system configuration to maintain
system stability or integrity and specific actions to maintain or
restore acceptable voltage levels.\" \[16\]. One specific application is
phasor measurement for the stabilisation of the alternating-current
phase in a transport network. For this, the voltage phase is measured
locally and sent to a remote-control centre. There, this information is
processed and automated actions are triggered. One can be the submission
of telegrams to power plants, instructing them to either accelerate or
deaccelerate their power generators in order to keep the voltage phase
in the transport network stable. A comprehensive overview of this topic
can be found elsewhere in the literature \[17\].

This kind of automation requires very low end-to-end latencies (5 ms)
\[16\] and―due to its critical importance for the operation of society―a
very high communication service availability (99,9999%).

#### D.4.2.1 Service area and connection density

As is the case for medium-voltage distribution networks (see Annex
D.4.1), connectivity in high-voltage automation has to be provided
mainly along the power line. The distances to be covered can be
substantial (hundreds of kilometres in rural settings), while shorter
links are prevalent in metropolitan areas. The number of connections in
wide-area power system protection is rather low; but―due to the
sliver-shaped service area―the connection density can be rather high
(1000 km^-2^).

#### D.4.2.2 Security

Due to its central role in virtually every country on earth, electricity
distribution is heavily regulated. Security assessment for, e.g.
deployments in North America, need to adhere to the NERC CIP suite
\[14\]. Technical implementations are described in standard suites such
as IEC 62351.

D.5 Intelligent transport systems -- infrastructure backhaul
------------------------------------------------------------

Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) embrace a wide variety of
communications-related applications that are intended to increase travel
safety, minimize environmental impact, improve traffic management, and
maximize the benefits of transportation to both commercial users and the
general public. Over recent years, the emphasis in intelligent vehicle
research has turned to co-operative systems in which the traffic
participants (vehicles, bicycles, pedestrians, etc.) communicate with
each other and/or with the infrastructure.

Cooperative ITS is the term used to describe technology that allows
vehicles to become connected to each other, and to the infrastructure
and other parts of the transport network. In addition to what drivers
can immediately see around them, and what vehicle sensors can detect,
all parts of the transport system will increasingly be able to share
information to improve decision making. Thus, this technology can
improve road safety through avoiding collisions, but also assist in
reducing congestion and improving traffic flows, and reduce
environmental impacts. Once the basic technology is in place as a
platform, an array of applications can be developed.

Cooperative ITS can greatly increase the quality and reliability of
information available about vehicles, their location and the road
environment. In the future, cars will know the location of road works
and the switching phases of traffic lights ahead, and they will be able
to react accordingly. This will make for safer and more convenient
travel and faster arrival at the destination. On-board driver
assistance, coupled with two-way communication between vehicles and
between cars and road infrastructure, can help drivers to better control
their vehicle and hence have positive effects in terms of safety and
traffic efficiency. An important role in this plays the so-called
road-side units (RSUs). Vehicles can also function as sensors reporting
weather and road conditions including incidents. In this way cars can be
used as information sources for high-quality information services.

RSUs are connected to the traffic control centre for management and
control purposes. They broadcast e.g. traffic light information (RSU 
vehicle) and traffic information from the traffic-control centre (TCC)
via the RSU to the vehicles (TCC  RSU  vehicle); and collect vehicle
probe data for the traffic control centre (vehicle  RSU  TCC). For
reliable distribution of data, low-latency and high-capacity connections
between RSUs (e.g. traffic lights, traffic signs, etc.) and the TCC is
required. This type of application comes with rather tight end-to-end
latency requirements for the communication service between RSU and TCC
(10 ms) since relayed data needs to be processed in the TCC and, if
needed, the results need to be forwarded to neighbouring RSUs. Also, the
availability of the communication service has to be very high (99,9999%)
in order to compete with existing wired technology and in order to
justify the costly deployment and maintenance of RSUs. Furthermore, due
to considerably large aggregation areas (see Annex D.5.1), considerable
amounts of data need to be backhauled to the TCC (up to 10 Mbps per
RSU).

### D.5.1 Service area and connection density

It is relatively hard to provide estimates for the service area
dimension. One reason is that it depends on the placement of the base
station relative to the RSUs. Also, the RSUs can, in principle, act as
relay nodes for each other. The service area dimension stated in table
7.2.3.2-1 indicates the size of the typical data collection area of an
RSU (2 km along a road), from which the minimum spacing of RSUs can be
inferred. The connection density can be quite high in case data is
relayed between RSUs, i.e. along the road (1000 km^-2^).

######## Annex E (informative): void 

######## Annex F (informative): QoS Monitoring 

F.1 QoS monitoring for assurance
--------------------------------

This Clause discusses how QoS monitoring information can be used for
assurance purposes. For background information on assurance see \[19\]
and appendix A.3 in \[20\].

Assurance consists of four major steps (see Figure F.1-1 and \[18\]):

-   *Customer\'s QoS requirements*

This states the level of quality required by the customer of a service.
This information is divulged to the provider.

-   *Service provider\'s offerings of QoS (or planned/targeted QoS)*

> This is a statement of the level of quality expected to be offered to
> the customer by the service provider.

-   *QoS achieved/delivered*

> This is the level of quality achieved and delivered to the customer.
> Monitoring information is divulged to the customer.

-   *Customer rating of QoS*

> The customer can compare the QoS achieved by the provider with the QoS
> requirements (see above) and its own experience of the QoS. This is a
> crucial step for establishing assurance about the fulfillment of the
> customer\'s requirements.

Figure F.1-1: QoS assurance by use of QoS monitoring information

NOTE: This Figure is based on the trust model in \[18\].

F.2 Network Diagnostics
-----------------------

**Network diagnostics** helps with scanning, diagnosing and identifying
problems within a **network**. **Diagnostics includes gathering data and
continuously providing sufficient performance parameters that
characterize the quality of the network connection. This includes data
of the physical connection as well as of logical links and sub-networks.
Exposure of relevant (and possibly aggregated) performance parameters
ensures a quick reaction in case of failure as well as identifying
network** connectivity, performance and other related problems.
**Network diagnostic should be able to:**

\- be proactive (to early detect failures) and not only reactive (to
deal with faults that have already occurred).

\- accurately differentiate malfunctions/failures and evaluate their
impact on the service/network.

\- provide clear explanations about what happened.

\- suggest corrective actions, and possibly perform them automatically.

Furthermore, specific connectivity information is also of interest as
well as usage information (e.g. traffic load) of the node (e.g. RAN).

Network diagnostic information needs to be generated automatically and,
in case of a hosted or virtual network deployment, be made available to
the tenant of the network via a suitable API.
