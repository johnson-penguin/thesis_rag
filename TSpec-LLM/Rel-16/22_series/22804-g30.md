Introduction
============

5G systems will extend mobile communication services beyond mobile
telephony, mobile broadband, and massive machine-type communication into
new application domains, so-called vertical domains, with special
requirements toward communication services. Communication for automation
in vertical domains comes with demanding requirements―high availability,
high reliability, low latency, and, in some cases, high-accuracy
positioning.

Communication for automation in vertical domains has to support the
applications for production in the corresponding vertical domain, for
instance, industrial automation and energy automation, but also
transportation. This focus―together with regulations specific for
vertical domains―have led to tailored communication concepts in vertical
domains such as dependable communication as well as specific security
standards and mechanisms. The present document provides an overview on
these concepts, in order to foster a common understanding used in
communication for automation in vertical domains and 5G communication
services, as well as the inference of a common terminology.

Many vertical use cases have been analysed by 3GPP and resulted in
several vertical communication requirements that are already part of TS
22.261 \[3\]. Besides the already specified KPIs for latency, jitter,
reliability, communication service availability, and data rate, other
general vertical communication requirements need to be transposed into
potential service requirements for 5G systems.

Communication for automation in vertical domains may take place in
type-a and/or type-b networks. Network monitoring interfaces are
necessary in order to assure network operation (SLAs). Multiple
verticals and users might be using the same 5G communication network
(multi-tenancy). Furthermore, vertical domains have their own security
standards, implementations, and vertical-domain specific regulations,
leading to stage-1 potential security requirements. Finally, integration
between 5G communication systems and already existing communication
networks of vertical domains is required.

Several missing representative vertical use cases for communication in
automation in vertical domains are described in the present document and
used for the derivation of further stage-1 potential requirements. These
use cases focus on low latency, high reliability, and high communication
service availability. Examples are automated guided vehicles and
rail-bound mass transit (subways and suburban rail).

The present document provides new use cases and stage 1 potential
requirements that have not yet been covered in previous stage 1
specifications. It is based on input from relevant stakeholders of the
respective vertical domains.

 1 Scope
=======

The present document focuses on 5G communication for automation in
vertical domains. This is communication that is involved in the
production of and working on work pieces and goods, and/or the delivery
of services in the physical world. Such communication often necessitates
low latency, high reliability, and high communication service
availability. Nevertheless, other types of communication are also
possible in this area. Moreover, communications with low latency, high
reliability, and high communication service availability, and other, not
so demanding communication services, may run in parallel on the same 5G
infrastructure.

The present document identifies stage 1 potential requirements for 5G
communication for automation in vertical domains. The potential
requirements are derived from different sources:

> \- existing work on dependable communication as used in vertical
> domains; see, for instance, IEC 61907 \[2\];
>
> \- use cases describing network operation in vertical domains with,
> for instance, common usage of the network (multi-tenancy) and network
> monitoring for assurance of service level agreements;
>
> \- security mechanisms already used in vertical domains; supporting
> the specific security requirements of vertical domains;
>
> \- new (additional to already existing stage-1 work), representative
> use cases in different vertical domains based on input from relevant
> vertical interest organisations and other stakeholders.

Furthermore, the present document provides an overview of relevant
communication concepts for automation in vertical domains from the point
of view of 5G systems. This overview is provided in order to facilitate
the mapping between communication for automation in vertical domains and
communication in 5G systems.

3 Definitions, symbols and abbreviations
========================================

3.1 Definitions
---------------

For the purposes of the present document, the terms and definitions
given in 3GPP TR 21.905 \[1\] and the following apply. A term defined in
the present document takes precedence over the definition of the same
term, if any, in 3GPP TR 21.905 \[1\].

**aggregator:** Service provider managing a system of electric
generation units, storage systems, and load (consumers), with
independent control and customer support in its own coverage area.

**automation:** the automatic operation or control of a process, device,
or system.

NOTE 1: This definition is based on \[10\].

**characteristic parameter:** numerical value that can be used for
characterising the dynamic behaviour of communication functionality from
an application point of view.

**clock synchronisation service:** the service to align otherwise
independent UE clocks.

**clock synchronicity:** the maximum allowed time offset within the
fully synchronised system between UE clocks.

NOTE 2: Clock synchronicity (or synchronicity) is used as KPI of clock
synchronisation services.

**communication service availability**: percentage value of the amount
of time the end-to-end communication service is delivered according to
an agreed QoS, divided by the amount of time the system is expected to
deliver the end-to-end service according to the specification in a
specific area.

NOTE 3: The end point in \"end-to-end\" is assumed to be the
communication service interface.

NOTE 4: The communication service is considered unavailable if it does
not meet the pertinent QoS requirements. If availability is one of these
requirements, the following rule applies: the system is considered
unavailable in case an expected message is not received within a
specified time, which, at minimum, is the sum of end-to-end latency,
jitter, and survival time.

NOTE 5: This definition was taken from clause 3.1 in \[3\].

**communication service reliability:** ability of the communication
service to perform as required for a given time interval, under given
conditions.

NOTE 6: Given conditions would include aspects that affect reliability,
such as: mode of operation, stress levels, and environmental conditions.

NOTE 7: Reliability may be quantified using appropriate measures such as
meantime to failure, or the probability of no failure within a specified
period of time.

NOTE 8: This definition is based on \[2\].

**end-to-end latency:** the time that takes to transfer a given piece of
information from a source to a destination, measured at the
communication interface, from the moment it is transmitted by the source
to the moment it is successfully received at the destination.

NOTE 9: This definition was taken from clause 3.1 in \[3\].

**factory automation:** automation application in industrial automation
branches typically with discrete characteristics of the application to
be automated with specific requirements for determinism, low latency,
reliability, redundancy, cyber security, and functional safety.

NOTE 9A: Low latency typically means below 10 ms delivery time.

NOTE 9B: This definition is taken from \[19\].

**IoT device:** a type of UE which is dedicated for a set of specific
use cases or services and which is allowed to make use of certain
features restricted to this type of UEs.

NOTE 10: An IoT device may be optimised for the specific needs of
services and application being executed (e.g., smart home/city, smart
utilities, e-Health and smart wearables). Some IoT devices are not
intended for human type communications.

NOTE 11: This definition was taken from clause 3.1 in \[3\].

**isochronous**: the time characteristic of an event or signal that is
recurring at known, periodic time intervals.

NOTE 12: Isochronous data transmission is a form of [synchronous data
transmission](http://ecss.nl/glossary/synchronous-data-transmission/) where
similar (logically or in size) data frames are sent linked to a periodic
clock pulse.

NOTE 13: Isochronous data transmission ensures that data between the
source and the sink of the A/V application flows continuously and at a
steady rate.

4 Overview
==========

4.1 Background
--------------

Clause 4 serves two main purposes. One, in Clause 4.2, it discusses the
concept of a vertical domain and it provides an overview of the vertical
domains addressed in the present document. Two, in Clause 4.3, it
provides a short overview of salient concepts developed in automation
research and standardisation. In Clause 4.3.1 automation control
paradigms and related data flows are discussed. In Clause 4.3.2, models
for describing communication in automation are introduced, and the
introduced concepts and parameters are mapped onto 5G concepts. In
Clause 4.3.3, the paramount automation system attribute---i.e.
dependability---is discussed and implications for 5G communication
systems are identified. In Clause 4.3.4 these dependability attributes
are described from a 5G communication service perspective and potential
parameters for describing dependable communication services, monitoring
services, location services, and clock synchronisation services are
introduced.

4.2 Vertical Domains

4.3 Automation
--------------

### 4.3.1 Data flows in automation

#### 4.3.1.1 Introduction

The term automation stands for the control of processes, devices, or
systems in vertical domains by automatic means \[10\]. Note that a
process always includes physical entities and their attributes. By
providing particular input to a process, one tries to generate a
particular output (see Figure 4.3.1.1-1).

![process to be
controlled](media/image3.emf){width="3.5833333333333335in"
height="0.8930555555555556in"}

Figure 4.3.1.1-1: Process to be controlled \[10\]. Note that the process
always has a physical component

NOTE: Example: input = heat; process = chemical reaction in a gas. In
this example, the output is the chemical reaction products.

Examples for such processes are chemical processes in the chemical
industry, the control of subways, and factory automation with industrial
robots. Example (1): the process in question is a chemical reaction and
the input is heat; the yield of the chemical reaction, i.e., the output,
varies with said heat. Example (2): for a subway, the input can be
electrical energy, the process the acceleration of the subway, and the
output reaching the cruising velocity of the subway.

The technology related to automation is referred to as operational
technology, which \"is hardware and software that detects or causes a
change through the direct monitoring and/or control of physical devices,
processes and events in the enterprise.\" \[12\]. An overview of
operational-technology devices can be found elsewhere in the literature
**\[11\]. The last decade has seen an increased integration of
operational and information technology \[14\].** Automation technology
can be used in private settings such as factories, but it is also used
in critical infrastructure such as the electricity grid, civil aviation,
public transport, etc. \[13\].

Clause 4.3.1.2 introduces the main type of systems used in automation,
i.e. control systems. Clause 4.3.1.3 introduces the most common activity
patterns of control systems. Clause 4.3.1.4 discusses the communication
attributes of an automation system. Finally, Clause 4.3.1.5 presents the
communication patterns entailed by automation systems.

#### 4.3.1.2 Control systems

As outlined in Clause 4.3.1.1, automation is about controlling processes
by aid of automated means. This objective is accomplished by the use of
control systems. \"A **control system** is an interconnection of
components forming a system configuration that will provide a desired
\[process\] response.\" \[10\].

Four main control functions can be distinguished \[11\]:

\- measure: obtain values from sensors and feed these values as input to
a process and/or provide these values as output, for instance to a human
user;

\- compare: evaluate measured values and compare to process design
values;

\- compute: calculate, for instance, current error, historic error,
future error etc.;

\- correct or control: adjust the process.

The four functions above are typically performed by four elements
\[11\]:

\- sensor: device capable of measuring various physical properties;

\- transmitter: device that converts measurements from a sensor and
sends the signal;

\- controller: provides the logic and control instructions for the
process;

\- actuator: changes the state of the environment; here the process.

NOTE: Frequently, the combination of sensor and transmitter is referred
to as a sensor. This is the style we are adhering to in the remainder of
the present document.

There are four common patterns of automation. One is open-loop control,
the second is feedback or closed-loop control, the third is sequence
control \[10\]\[11\], and the fourth is batch control \[70\]. These
patterns are discussed in more detail in Clause 4.3.1.3.

#### 4.3.1.3 Activity patterns in automation

##### 4.3.1.3.1 Open-loop control

The salient aspect of open-loop control is the lack of output control;
when providing desired output responses to an actuator, it is assumed
that the output of the influenced process is predetermined and within an
acceptable range. Figure 4.3.1.3.1-1 depicts an open-loop control
system.

![](media/image4.emf){width="4.797916666666667in"
height="0.7979166666666667in"}

Figure 4.3.1.3.1-1: Open-loop control system \[10\]

This kind of control loop works if the influences of the environment on
process and actuator are negligible. Also, this kind of control is
applied in case unwanted output can be tolerated. For instance, the
damage done by an electric toaster (open-loop control system) by
slightly burning a slice of bread is usually assumed to be negligible.
In this example, the desired output response is the crispiness of the
toasted bread. The response can, for instance, be chosen by turning a
dial on the toaster. The actuator is the heater in the toaster. The dial
sets a certain energy level and/or toasting time. When activated, the
heater generates heat, which increases the crispiness of the inserted
slice of bread over time. This is the process. The output is the toast
itself.

##### 4.3.1.3.2 Closed-Loop Control

Closed-loop control enables the manipulation of processes even if the
environment influences the process or the performance of the actuator
changes over time. This type of control is realised by sensing the
process output and by feeding these measurements back into a controller.
**Figure 4.3.1.3.2-1 depicts such a system.**

![](media/image5.emf){width="5.273611111111111in" height="1.75in"}

Figure 4.3.1.3.2-1: Multi-variable closed-loop control system \[10\]

\"In contrast to an open-loop control system, a closed-loop control
system utilizes \[measurements\] of the actual output to compare the
actual output with the desired output response.\" \[10\]. \"An example
of a closed-loop control system is a person steering an automobile
(assuming his or her eyes are open) by looking at the auto's location on
the road and making the appropriate adjustments.\" \[10\].

##### 4.3.1.3.3 Sequence Control

Sequence control may either step through a fixed sequence or it employs
logic that performs different actions based on various system states and
system input \[10\]\[11\]. Sequence control can be seen as an extension
of both open-loop and closed-loop control, but instead of achieving only
one output instance, an entire sequence of output instances can be
produced. An example of sequence control is controlling an elevator.
Based on at what floor it currently resides, to what floor it is
summoned, and to what floor it is directed, different kinds of control
actions and actuations are taken. Note that although the name \"sequence
control\" seems to imply a pre-programmed sequence of desired output
responses, the elevator example shows that event-based control can also
be realised with sequence control.

##### 4.3.1.3.3A Batch control

Batch processes lead to the production of finite quantities of material
(batches) by subjecting input materials to a defined order of processing
actions by use of one or more pieces of equipment \[70\]. The product
produced by a batch process is called a batch. Batch processes are
discontinuous processes. Batch processes are neither discrete nor
continuous; however, they have characteristics of both.

#### 4.3.1.4 Communication attributes

##### 4.3.1.4.1 Introduction

**Communication in automation can be characterised by two main
attributes: periodicity and determinism.**

##### 4.3.1.4.2 Periodicity

**In terms of periodicity, it is possible to send messages periodically
or aperiodically.**

**Periodically means that a transmission interval is repeated. For
example, a transmission occurs every 15 ms. Reasons for a periodical
transmission can be the periodic update of a position or the repeated
monitoring of a characteristic parameter. Note that a transmission of a
temperature every 15 minutes is a periodical transmission. However, most
periodic intervals in communication for automation are rather short. The
transmission is started once and continuous unless a stop command is
provided.**

**An a-periodical transmission is, for example, a transmission which is
triggered instantaneously by an event, i.e. events are the trigger of
the transmission. Events are defined by the control system or by the
user. Example events are:**

\- Process events: events that come from the process when thresholds are
exceeded or fallen below, e.g., temperature, pressure, level, etc.

\- Diagnostic events: events that indicate malfunctions of an automation
device or module, e.g. power supply defective; short circuit; too high
temperature; etc.

\- Maintenance events: events based on information that indicates
necessary maintenance work to prevent the failure of an automation
device.

**Most events, and especially alarms, are confirmed. In this context,
alarms are messages that inform a controller or operator that an event
has occurred, e.g. an equipment malfunction, process deviation, or other
abnormal condition requiring a response. The receipt of the alarm is
acknowledged by the application that received the alarm. The receipt of
the event is usually confirmed within a short time period. If no
acknowledgment is received from the target application after a pre-set
time---the so-called monitoring time---has elapsed, the alarm is sent
again after a preset time.**

##### 4.3.1.4.3 Determinism

**Determinism refers to whether the delay between transmission of a
message and receipt of the message at the destination address is stable
(within bounds). Usually, communication is called deterministic if it is
bounded by a given threshold for the latency/transmission time. In case
of a periodic transmission, the variation of the interval is bounded.**

##### 4.3.1.4.4 Control systems and related communication patterns

**There is no straight-forward, one-to-one mapping between the type of
control and the communication pattern. However, there are preferences.
Open-loop control is characterised by one or many messages sent to an
actuator. These can be sent in a periodic or an aperiodic pattern.
However, the communication means used need to be deterministic since
typically an activity response from the receiver and/or the receiving
application is expected. For instance, for the toaster example in Clause
4.3.1.3.1, the waiting time between activating the toaster and
commencement of heating the slice of bread should not be arbitrary.**

**Closed-loop control produces both periodic and aperiodic communication
patterns. If, for instance, sensor output is only generated when a
threshold, e.g. a preset room temperature is exceeded, the timing of the
message transmitted to the controller is regulated by the process and
not a preset timer. Closed-loop control is often used for the control of
continuous processes with tight time-control limits, e.g., the control
of a printing press. In this case, one typically relies on periodic
communication patterns. Note that in both the aperiodic and periodic
case, the communication needs to be deterministic. For instance, for
periodic communication, measurements from adjacent measurement cycles
could otherwise arrive at the controller out of order and not within the
time needed to guarantee a stable operation of the controller.**

**The communication attributes required by sequence control generally
depend on whether the underlying control paradigm is open or closed.**

**Logging of device states, measurements, etc. for maintenance purposes
and such typically entails aperiodic communication patterns. In case the
transmitted logging information can be time-stamped by the respective
function, determinism is often not mandatory.**

### 4.3.2 Communication in automation

#### 4.3.2.1 Modelling of communication in automation

##### 4.3.2.1.1 Area of consideration

For our discussion of the communication in automation we apply a
definition of the area of consideration for industrial radio
communication that is found elsewhere in the literature \[17\]. This
definition is depicted in Figure 4.3.2.1.1-1.

![](media/image6.emf){width="5.86875in" height="3.36875in"}

Figure 4.3.2.1.1-1: Abstract diagram of the area of consideration for
industrial radio communication

NOTE: Blue objects: communication system; other objects: automation
application system.

Here, a distributed automation application system is depicted. This
system includes a distributed automation application, which is the
aggregation of a number of automation functions. These can be functions
in sensors, measurement devices, drives, switches, I/O devices, encoders
etc. Field bus systems, industrial Ethernet systems, or wireless
communication systems can be used for connecting the distributed
functions. The essential function of these communication systems is the
distribution of messages among the distributed automation functions.
Depending on the objectives, the dependability of the entire
communication system and/or of its devices or its links may be of
interest (more on dependability in Clause 4.3.3). Communication
functions are realised by the respective hardware and software
implementation.

In order for the automation application system to operate, messages need
to be exchanged between spatially distributed application functions. For
that process, messages are exchanged at an interface between the
automation application system and the communication system. This
interface is termed the reference interface. Required and guaranteed
values for characteristic parameters which describe the behavioural
properties of the radio communication system refer to that interface
(see Clause 4.3.4.4 and \[19\]\[62\]).

These characteristic parameters include dependability parameters of
industrial radio communication, which are defined in \[17\] and \[62\].

The conditions that influence the behaviour of wireless communication
are framed by the communication requirements of the application (e.g.,
length of the message), the characteristics of the communication system
(e.g., output power of a transmitter), and the transmission conditions
of the media (e.g., signal fluctuations caused by multipath
propagation).

If a dependability assessment is to be performed, it is necessary---in
accordance with the definition of the concept of dependability---to
specify an asset, its function, and the conditions under which the
function is to be performed. In this context, an asset is for instance a
logical link (see Clause 4.3.2.1.2).

General requirements from the application point of view for the time and
failure behaviour of a communication system are mostly related to an
end-to-end link. It is assumed in this connection that the behaviour of
the link is representative of the communication system as a whole and of
the entire scope of the application.

##### 4.3.2.1.2 Logical link

###### 4.3.2.1.2.1 Nature and function

Starting with the general approach mentioned above, the logical link can
be regarded as a possible asset within the area of consideration (see
Figure 4.3.2.1.2.1-1). The conditions under which its functions are to
be performed are vital for the dependability of the automation
application system.

![](media/image7.emf){width="6.690277777777778in" height="3.61875in"}

Figure 4.3.2.1.2.1-1: The concept of a logical link

This is the link between a logical end point in a source device and the
logical end point in a target device. Logical end points are elements of
the reference interface, which may group several logical end points
together.

The intended function of the logical link is the transmission of a
sequence of messages from a logical source end point to the correct
logical target end point. This is achieved by transforming each message
into a form that fosters error-free transmission. The transmission
process includes certain processes, e.g. repetitions, in order to fulfil
the intended function. After transmission, the message is converted back
into a form which is usable by the application. The message is to be
available and correct at the target within a defined time. The sequence
of messages at the target is to be the same as the sequence at the
source.

The functional units which are necessary to fulfil this function are
shown in Figure 4.3.2.1.2.1-2.

![](media/image8.emf){width="6.273611111111111in"
height="1.8215277777777779in"}

Figure 4.3.2.1.2.1-2: The asset \"logical link\"

The required function can be impaired by various influences, which can
lead to communication errors. Such errors are described elsewhere in the
literature \[17\]\[18\]. A summary of these errors is provided in Annex
B. The occurrence of one of these errors influences the values of the
relevant dependability parameters of the logical link.

###### 4.3.2.1.2.2 Message transformation

From an implementation point of view, it is hardly possible to identify
communication layers and interfaces in devices in a unified manner, e.g.
with reference to the Open System Interconnection (OSI) model \[15\].
However, the implementation of communication functions is mostly split
between a higher communication layer (HCL) and a lower communication
layer (LCL), which may contain different parts of the OSI reference
model from implementation to implementation. Our further discussion is
therefore based on a generic implementation view with HCL and LCL.

The messages to be transmitted for the intended function of a logical
link are defined by strings of characters with a certain semantic. Such
a character string is handed over as user data at the reference
interface for transmission. If the number of characters in a message is
too great for it to be transmitted as a unit, the message can be divided
for transmission into several packets (fragmentation). Figure
4.3.2.1.2.2-2 uses repeated sending as a hedging method for packet loss
(example of an unconfirmed service). The packets are then passed from a
higher communication layer (HCL) to a lower communication layer (LCL)
\[Figure 4.3.2.1.2.2-1\]. There, a bit stream is created and handed over
to the physical layer (PL). A signal stream corresponding to the bit
stream is transmitted from the physical layer of the source device to
the target device. In the target device, the signal stream received is
converted by physical layer into a bit stream, which is passed to the
lower communication layer. There, packets are formed, handed over by the
lower communication layer to the higher communication layer and grouped
together into a message. Suitable mechanisms (acknowledgement, parallel
transmission through different communication channels/media, multiple
transmissions of identical packets, etc.) can increase the probability
of the message reaching the application correctly when a packet is lost.
The loss of a packet is therefore not to be equated in all cases with
the loss of a message.

Figure 4.3.2.1.2.2-1 shows the transmission of a message that is broken
into two packets. The transmission includes acknowledgements. If no
acknowledgement is received within the required period (packet 2), the
packet is transmitted again (bit stream 2). This is the main difference
to, for example, Figure 4.3.2.1.2.2-2, where the packets are repeated
from the beginning to protect against loss or error directly. In Figure
4.3.2.1.2.2-2, a confirmation is not sent.

##### 4.3.2.1.3 Communication device

The communication devices---together with the physical link---determine
the function and thus the dependability of the logical link (see Figure
4.3.2.1.3-1). The function of the communication devices is the correct
sending and correct receipt of sequences of messages. The methods and
algorithms implemented in the communication devices should take the best
possible account of the transmission conditions during message
transmission, and fulfil the requirements for message transmission as
well as possible.

![](media/image11.emf){width="6.809722222222222in"
height="2.0479166666666666in"}

Figure 4.3.2.1.3-1: Asset \"communication device\"

Apart from the methods and algorithms themselves, their implementation
in hardware and software is also of importance. The errors listed in
Annex C can have an impact on dependability.

##### 4.3.2.1.4 Communication system

The communication system as an asset represents a quantity of logical
links whose message transmissions are implemented by a number of
wireless devices via one or more media. The communication system
function to be provided consists in transmitting messages for all the
logical links in the distributed application. This function is to be
performed for a defined period, the operating time of the automation
application.

In an automation application system it is paramount that requirements
pertaining to logical links are fulfilled. These requirements and the
conditions can be very different from one case and implementation to the
other. The functions (services and protocols) for individual logical
links can therefore also be different. In spite of these differences,
some of the logical links share communication devices and media.
Consequently, the communication system as a whole is an asset for
dependability assessment in the examination of system and application
aspects.

### 4.3.3 Dependable communication

#### 4.3.3.1 Introduction

According to ISO, dependability (of an item) is the \"ability to perform
as and when required\" \[20\]. This is a paramount property of any
automation system. Automation systems that are not dependable can, for
instance, be unsafe or they can exhibit low productivity. Clause 4.3.3.2
discusses system dependability in further detail, and this information
is used to analyse communication dependability and its implication for
5G systems in Clause 4.3.3.3.

#### 4.3.3.2 System dependability

Dependability can be broken down into five system properties:
reliability, availability, maintainability, safety, and integrity (see
Figure 4.3.3.2-1) \[44\].

![](media/image12.emf){width="5.595138888888889in" height="1.13125in"}

Figure 4.3.3.2-1: The five facets of system dependability: reliability,
availability, maintainability, safety, and integrity \[44\]

Definitions for each system property are provided in Table 4.3.3.2-1.

Table 4.3.3.2-1: Definitions of the five system properties into which
system dependability can be broken down (see Figure 4.3.3.2-1) \[44\].

  **System property**   **Definition**
  --------------------- -----------------------------------------------------------------
  Reliability           Continuity of correct operation
  Availability          Readiness for correct operation
  Maintainability       Ability to undergo modifications and repairs
  Safety                Absence of catastrophic consequences on user(s) and environment
  Integrity             Absence of improper system alterations

Availability indicates whether the system is ready for use at a given
time. This system property is typically quantified by the percentage of
time during which a system operates correctly. Reliability indicates how
long correct operation continues. This system property is typically
defined as the (mean) time between failures. Both properties are
illustrated with and example. In this example the system has an
availability of 99,99%. This implies that its unavailability is 0,01%,
or 53 min on average per year. If the system fails on average thrice a
year then, reliability, quantified as the mean time between failures, is
four months.

Availability and reliability are closely related to the productivity of
a system. A system featuring a low availability is rarely ready for
operation and is thus characterised by low productivity. If the system
reliability is low, i.e. the time between failures is short, the system
comes often to a halt, which contravenes continuous productivity.

#### 4.3.3.3 Definition of communication dependability and its implications

##### 4.3.3.3.1 Introduction

A composite system, where every subsystem is instrumental to the
operation of the composite system, is not dependable if any of the
subsystems is undependable. This has the following implications for the
use of communication systems in general, and 5G systems in particular.
Figure 4.3.3.3.1-1 depicts a generic, distributed automation system,
where the automation functions interact via a communication system.

Figure 4.3.3.3.1-1: Example of a distributed automation system
consisting of automation functions and a communication network

In this example, all three subsystems, i.e. the automation functions and
the communication network need to be dependable for the automation
system to be dependable.

Communication dependability is the property of a dependable
communication system. According to IEC 61907, network dependability is
the \"ability to perform as and when required to meet specified
communication and operational requirements\" \[2\]. This definition
largely agrees with 3GPP's own definition: \"A performance criterion
that describes the degree of certainty (or surety) with which a function
is performed regardless of speed or accuracy, but within a given
observational interval\" \[1\]. What does communication dependability
imply in praxis from the vantage point of the automation functions? We
address this for each of the five system properties in Figure 4.3.3.2-1.

##### 4.3.3.3.2 Reliability

According to IEC 61907, network reliability is the \"ability to perform
as required for a given time interval, under given conditions\" \[2\].

NOTE: Given conditions \"would include aspects that affect reliability,
such as: mode of operation, stress levels, environmental conditions\"
\[2\].

Automation functions need highly reliable communication. As a rule of
thumb the more infrequent communication is unavailable the better.

Note that reliability in the context of dependability has a different
meaning than employed in TS 22.261, which defines it as the \"percentage
value of the amount of sent network layer packets successfully delivered
to a given node within the time constraint required by the targeted
service, divided by the total number of sent network layer packets\"
\[3\]. This definition is more akin to the definition of network
availability (see Clause 4.3.3.3.3) and it focuses on the inner working
of the network rather than the end-to-end experience of functions
consuming the network\'s communication capabilities. In order to avoid
confusion, reliability of a communication system is henceforth referred
to as communication service reliability. We discuss this in more detail
in Clause 4.3.4.

##### 4.3.3.3.3 Availability

According to IEC 61907, network availability is the \"ability to be in a
state to perform as and when required, under given conditions, assuming
that the necessary external resources are provided\" \[2\]. Note that
given conditions \"would include aspects that affect reliability,
maintainability and maintenance support performance\" \[2\]. It is
important to point out that a communication network that does not meet
the communication requirements of the automation functions, e.g. a
maximum end-to-end latency, are considered to be unavailable.

##### 4.3.3.3.4 Maintainability

According to IEC 61907, network maintainability is the \"ability to be
retained in, or restored to, a state in which it can perform as required
under given conditions of use and maintenance\" \[2\]. Note that given
conditions of maintenance \"include the procedures and resources to be
used\" \[2\]. \"Maintainability may be quantified using such measures
as, mean time to restoration, or the probability of restoration within a
specified period of time\" \[2\]. Clause 4.3.4 discusses what
maintainability implies for a dependable communication service.

##### 4.3.3.3.5 Safety

As introduced in Clause 4.3.3.2, safety stands for the absence of
catastrophic consequences on user(s) and environment. For a distributed
automation system this implies that neither the automation functions
including their physical embodiment, nor the processes, nor the
environment should be damaged by the communication system. This
communication system property is---for instance---addressed through
regulations such as directive 2014/53/EU \[21\]. Note that in most
automation implementations the safety of the communication systems can
be treated separately and that the overall safety of the distributed
automation system is addressed by automation functions such as
functional-safety mechanisms.

##### 4.3.3.3.6 Integrity

According to IEC 61907, network integrity is the \"ability to ensure
that the data throughput contents are not contaminated, corrupted, lost
or altered between transmission and reception\" \[2\]. Note that this
communication system property is---in the communication network
community---seen as an atomic property of information security in
communication systems. More on this in Clause 6.1.

##### 4.3.3.3.7 Implications for 5G systems

In order to be suitable for automation in vertical domains, 5G systems
need to be dependable, i.e. they need to come with the system properties
in Clause 4.3.3.3.2 to Clause 4.3.3.3.6. What particular requirements
each property needs to meet depends on the particularities of the domain
and the use case. More on this in Clause 5. Clause 4.3.4 addresses what
the request for communication dependability implies for communication
services provided by 5G systems.

It is important to understand that the relationship between
communication service availability, communication service continuity,
communication service reliability, and the probability of an erroneous
message transmission anything but trivial. Understanding this
relationship is also important since communication service in this
document is not defined according to TL 9000 \[56\], for example.

According to ISO/IEC \[54\], service continuity is \"capability to
manage risks and events that could have serious impact on a service or
services in order to continually deliver services at agreed levels\".
According to TS 22.261 \[3\], the service continuity is "the
uninterrupted user experience of a service that is using an active
communication when a UE undergoes an access change without, as far as
possible, the user noticing the change". The concept of service
continuity in TS 22.261 is very narrow and limited to a "capability" of
confronting only an event of "UE undergoing an access change". The
communication service continuity can be impacted by many other events
either in the control plane or the user plane, or both, such as
intervening exceptions or anomalies, whether scheduled or unscheduled,
malicious, intentional or unintentional \[55\]. For a reliable system,
any event which might impact to the communication service continuity is
needed to be considered.

A maximum tolerable communication service unavailability of, for
instance, 10^-6^ does not always imply a maximum tolerable probability
of erroneous and prohibitively delayed end-to-end message transmission
of 10^-6^ .One of the main reasons for why this generally is not the
case is a non-zero survival time. This is illustrated with the example
below.

*Survival time revisited*

According to TS 22.261, the survival time is \"the time that an
application consuming a communication service may continue without an
anticipated message\" \[3\]. Anticipation implies following aspects:
timeliness and correctness. The communication service continuity implies
the following three conditions: firstly, the message needs to arrive in
time (timeliness); secondly, only uncorrupted messages are accepted by
the receiver; and thirdly, the received messages need to be processed
and sent out from 3GPP 5G system to the target automation function. So,
if at least one of these conditions is not fulfilled, a timer is started
by the automation function. Upon expiration of the timer, the
communication service for that application is declared \"unavailable\"
(service discontinuity; also see Clause A.2). The expiration time is
referred to as the survival time.

*Influence of survival time on the acceptable probability of untimely
message transmission*

To simplify the discussion, it is assumed that none of the transmitted
messages is corrupted or lost because of an anomaly in the communication
system and that thus the only cause of unavailability of a communication
service is that the end-to-end latency of a message lies outside the
interval specified by the jitter (see Appendix A.3 for more details on
jitter and timeliness).

Example: the update time is 50 ms. A survival time of 0 ms implies that
any untimely arrival of a message (e.g. the update time of that message
delivery is outside of the interval specified by the jitter）triggers
the communication to be declared as \"down\" by the automation function.
Thus, if the aggregate communication service unavailability is specified
as 10^-6^ and lower, an untimely arrival of messages shall only occur up
to 1 in one million cycles for periodic communication.

The situation changes markedly for non-zero survival times. For a
survival time of, e.g., 100 ms (see table 7.2.2-1 in \[3\]), the target
automation function waits two more cycles after a delayed message before
it declares the communication service as unavailable. If the likelihood
of a single untimely arrival is *p*, and if the sequential untimely
arrivals are independent of each other, the likelihood of three untimely
arrivals in a row is *p*^3^, which is the likelihood for the
communication service to be unavailable. For a target unavailability of
10^-6^, the acceptable likelihood of a single untimely arrival can thus
be as high as 0,01.

The implications for the likelihood of a single untimely arrival are
even more relaxed for longer survival times. For automated
commuter-train control, the survival time is up to five times longer
than the cycle time (see Clause5.1*.*1.2). Thus, in this case, six
untimely arrivals have to occur in a row before the communication
service is declared unavailable. The likelihood of such an event is
*p*^6^, which, for a target unavailability of 10^-6^ for this
commuter-train control, implies that *p* ≤ 0,1. In other words 1 out of
10 messages (!) may arrive outside the time interval specified by the
receiver while keeping the automation function consuming this
communication service operational.

*Influence of communication service reliability on the probability of
erroneous message transmission*

The above examples are simplistic since the influence of communication
service reliability has not been taken into account. This influence is
also discussed for a concrete example. In this example, it is assumed
that the user of the aforementioned communication service expects the
downtime of the system to be contingent and to only occur once a year.
An unavailability of 10^-6^ translates thus into a maximum continuous
unavailability of \~ 30 s per year. The implication for the tolerable
erroneous transmission probability is not trivial, since many scenarios
can result in such an excellent performance. One possible extreme is
that no erroneous transmission occurs during the most of the year, but
then the communication times out for 30 s in a row. Another possible
extreme is that the every cycle is erroneous, but that a correct message
is delivered before the survival timer runs out. In such a case, the
communication service unavailability is actually zero. In praxis, a
comprehensive stochastic analysis is needed in order to understand the
implications of communication service reliability on the tolerable
probability of erroneous message transmission, and a range of
measurements may need to be defined and carried out in order to infer
comprehensive performance requirements that guarantee high communication
fidelity. An example for such a performance requirement is related to
the maximum service unavailability time.

*Implications of data packet fragmentation for reliability*

According to TS 22.261, reliability is defined as percentage value of
the amount of sent network layer packets successfully delivered to a
given node within the time constraint required by the targeted service,
divided by the total number of sent network layer packets \[3\]. If the
messages to be transported by the communication service are so short
that they are not broken into several packets, then the above discussion
can also be applied to reliability. However, in case messages are broken
into several packets then the implications of a communication service
unavailability for the reliability of a 5G system is contingent on
implementation details such as how messages are constructed from packets
and whether timeliness issues in one packet influence that of an
adjacent packet.

### 4.3.4 Dependable communication service

#### 4.3.4.1 Introduction

Clause 4.3.4 discusses important criteria that are used for evaluating
dependable 5G communication services from an end-to-end perspective.
Dependability and its attributes are addressed in Clause 4.3.3.

#### 4.3.4.2 Network dependability

Network dependability can be classified as follows \[2\]:

> \- needed dependability: the end-users' network dependability
> requirements;
>
> \- offered dependability: the service provider's offerings of network
> dependability (or planned/targeted network dependability);
>
> \- achieved dependability: the dependability achieved or delivered by
> the service provider;
>
> \- perceived dependability: the dependability perceived/experienced by
> the end-users.

The end-users' \"dependability needs are the primary source of
information for establishing dependability requirements." \[2\]. Note
that in this framework one differentiates between needed, offered,
achieved, and perceived/experienced dependability. This is in line with
concepts developed by the ITU-T for quality in of service \[22\]. The
ITU-T differentiates between the customer\'s QoS requirements and the
offered, achieved and perceived QoS.

#### 4.3.4.3 Network serviceability

When communication functionalities are offered as services,
dependability is contingent on what is referred to as serviceability.
\"Serviceability reflects the delivery of network dependability of
service to the end-users. Higher serviceability improves availability,
provides integrity of service without excessive impairments, and reduces
service costs.

Serviceability can be described using the following performance
criteria.

a\) Service accessibility

Service accessibility is the ability of a network service to be accessed
by the user, under given conditions, for a given period of time. For
connection-oriented services, it refers to the ability to establish
connection. Accessibility can be measured in terms of service access
delay, network access capability, and service access control capability.
(\...)

b\) Service retainability

Service retainability is the ability of a network service, once
obtained, to continue to be provided under given conditions for a
requested duration. It reflects the reliability of \[the\] network.
(\...) Retainability requires network dependability support to maintain
stable operation. (\...)

c\) Service integrity

Service integrity is the delivery of information and data by the network
without excessive impairment. Service integrity relates to the transfer
of information and data known as throughput. (\...)

d\) Disengagement

Disengagement concerns the network devices and links involved in the
end-to-end communication of a user as well as network resources
(including bandwidth, channel or resources related to upper-layer
protocols) to be released when the communication connection or session
is closed. (\...) Disengagement is a characteristic affecting service
accessibility and service retainability in network serviceability.\"
\[2\].

NOTE 1: Disengagement is not so much a concern of the end user, rather
of the network operator. This aspect fosters service accessibility and
retainability by keeping the share of committed but unused communication
resources low. Also, disengagement lowers the risk of security attacks
in which an unauthorised user attains network access by re-using
identifiers of dormant communication services.

Serviceability has an additional flavour, which is operability. \"From
the user's perspective, operability refers to the ability of a service
to be successfully and easily operated by a user.\" \[2\]. This flavour
is especially important in dynamic communication scenarios and for
machine-to-machine communication.

NOTE 2: Operability is used to characterise the four serviceability
criteria above. When applying the operability criterion one can, for
instance, ask how easy it is to gain access to the communication
service, while service accessibility focuses on how access is gained.

Table 4.3.4.3-1 provides a mapping between serviceability criteria and
dependability attributes. For the latter see Clause 4.3.3.2.

Table 4.3.4.3-1: Serviceability criteria and corresponding dependability
attributes

  **Serviceability criterion**   **Corresponding dependability attribute**
  ------------------------------ ----------------------------------------------------
  Accessibility                  Availability, reliability

  Integrity                      Integrity, safety
  Disengagement                  Availability, reliability

A comparison of serviceability criteria stipulated by IEC 61907 (see
Table 4.3.4.3-1) and those stipulated by 3GPP (see the definition of QoS
in \[1\]) is provided in Table 4.3.4.3-2.

#### 4.3.4.4 Describing dependable communication services

In order to deliver a dependable communication service, one needs to
assure the \"continuity of service against failures and denial of
service access and disengagement, and the transfer of user information
against loss or interruption." \[2\]. The dependability of the service
from an end-user perspective is ensured at the service access point
(interfaces in Figure 4.3.3.3.1-1). The end-user dependability
requirements determine the required network performance, which in turn
determine the required network parameters. As outlined in Clause
4.3.4.3, dependability requirements can be sorted under four
serviceability criteria. However, as discussed in Clause 4.3.4.2, the
dependability mind set also necessitates the differentiation of
requested, offered, achieved and experienced dependability. The implied
assurance is another paramount facet of a communication service.
Assurance is a praxis that produces assurance judgments, i.e. statements
that inspire confidence of, for instance, the user of the communication
service. Ideally, assurance judgments are based on evidence. The
evidence on which an assurance judgement is based can be obtained by the
means of service monitoring. More on assurance, assurance methodology,
and assurance frameworks can be found in appendix A.3 of \[23\]. More
details on communication assurance and monitoring for assurance can be
found elsewhere in the literature \[24\]. Such monitoring could, for
instance, include the communication service availability. If the service
monitoring shows that the service has been available for more than
99,92% over a year, the following assurance statement can be made: \"The
continuous monitoring of communication service availability over a year
shows that the unavailability of the communication service is less than
0,08%. This implies that the communication service availability
requested by the user, i.e. 99,9%, is met.\" Assurance takes place at
the service interface, which is the single point of interaction between
the communication network and the users, i.e. the automation functions.
The set of facets of a dependable communication service is summarised in
Figure 4.3.4.4-1.

Figure 4.3.4.4-1: Facets of a dependable communication service

So far only automation functions have been addressed, but other types of
applications requiring dependable communication services, e.g. PMSE (see
Clause 7.8) can be served by the same conceptual framework.

So what about the related service description, in particular the service
interface? Table 4.3.4.4-1, 4.3.4.4-2 and 4.3.4.4-3 summarise candidate
interface parameters. The lists are grouped according to whether the
parameter stands for automation function requirements (Table 4.3.4.4-1),
influence quantities (Table 4.3.4.4-2), or management/control parameters
(Table 4.3.4.4-3). The meaning of the columns is explained after each
table.

NOTE 1: Some of the terminology in the following tables is defined in
Clause 3.1.

NOTE 2: The end-to-end connectivity either takes place on layer 3 (IP
traffic) or layer 2 (Ethernet) for the use cases described in the
present document. The parameters in Table 4.5.4.4-1 to 4.3.4.4-3 apply
to both types of services.

NOTE 3: Parameters described in Table 4.3.4.4-1 to 4.3.4.4-3 are
applicable to the use cases in the following Clauses: 5.1, 5.3, 5.3.1.
to 5.3.14, 5.3.18, 5.6.4, 5.6.5, 5.8.2 to 5.8.4.

NOTE 4: Not all of the parameters in Table 4.3.4.4-1 and Table
4.3.4.4.-2 would be used in a service call.

NOTE 5: Ingress and egress in this Clause are in reference to the
communication service interface between the source application and the
communication service interface (ingress) and the communication service
and the target application (egress).

**Parameter description**

*Communication service availability*

This parameter indicates if the communication system works as contracted
(\"available\"/\"unavailable\" state). The communication system is in
the \"available\" state as long as the availability criteria for
transmitted packets are met. The service is unavailable if the packets
received at the target are impaired and/or untimely (e.g. update time \>
stipulated maximum). If the survival time is larger than zero,
consecutive impairments and/or delays are ignored until the respective
time has expired (see Figure A.2-1).

*End-to-end latency*

This parameter indicates the time allotted to the communication system
for transmitting a message (see Clause 3.1) and the permitted jitter.

*Time between failures*

This parameter is an indicator for communication service reliability
(see Clause 4.3.3.3.2). This parameters states how long the
communication service has to be available before it becomes unavailable.
For instance, a mean time between failures of one day indicates that a
communication service on average has to run error-free for one day
before an error / errors make the communication service unavailable (see
above). The default value is zero.

*Time-triggered transmission*

With time triggered transmission, the messages are forwarded according
to a configurable time schedule, which is based on a reference time. The
time schedule defines the time windows when the message shall be
transmitted. Time-triggered transmission is contingent on a global
network time and suits periodic communication of very low update time.
This type of service is suitable when the target application does not
keep the time.

*Service bit rate*

*a) deterministic communication*

The target value indicates committed data rate in bit/s sought from the
communication service. This is the minimum data rate the communication
system guarantees to provide at any time, i.e. in this case target value
= user experienced data rate.

*b) non-deterministic communication*

The target value indicates the target data rate in bit/s. This is the
information rate the communication system aims at providing on average
during a given (moving) time window (unit: s). The user experienced data
rate the lower data rate threshold for any of the time windows.

*Update time*

Applicable only to periodic communication, the update time indicates the
time interval between any two consecutive messages delivered from the
egress (of the communication system) to the application (see Clause
A.4).

**Traffic classes**

In practice, vertical communication networks serve a large number of
applications exhibiting a wide range of communication requirements. In
order to facilitate efficient modelling of the communication network
during engineering and for reducing the complexity of network
optimisation, disjoint QoS sets have been identified. These sets are
referred to as traffic classes \[28\]. Typically only three traffic
classes are needed in industrial environments \[28\], i.e.

\- deterministic periodic communication;

\- deterministic aperiodic communication; and

\- non-deterministic communication.

For a discussion of determinism and periodicity see Clause 4.3.1.4.

Deterministic periodic communication stands for periodic communication
with stringent requirements on timeliness of the transmission.

Deterministic aperiodic communication stands for communication without a
preset sending time. Typical activity patterns for which this kind of
communication is suitable are event-driven actions.

Non-deterministic communication subsumes all other types of traffic.
Periodic non-real time and aperiodic non-real time traffic are subsumed
by the non-deterministic traffic class, since periodicity is irrelevant
in case the communication is not time-critical.

**Parameter description**

*Burst*

The transmission of, for instance, program code and configuration data
may be handed to the 3GPP system as data burst. In this case, the
ingress data rate exceeds the capacity of the network, which implies
that some of the data has to be stored within the ingress node of the
communication system before it can be transmitted to the egress
interface(s). However, the data of a burst needs to be transmitted
completely. This is in contrast to periodic data transmission, where new
messages overwrite old ones.

Typical metrices for bursts:

\- aperiodic data transmission: maximum user data length and minimum
transfer interval;

\- non-deterministic transmission: message length and line rate of the
service interface.

*Survival time*

The maximum survival time indicates the time period the communication
service may not meet the application\'s requirement before it is deemed
to be in an unavailable state.

NOTE 6: The survival time indicates to the communication service the
time available to recover from failure. This parameter is thus tightly
related to maintainability (see Clause 4.3.3.3.4) and the serviceability
facet \"service retainability\" (see Clause 4.3.4.3).

*Transfer interval*

Applicable only to periodic communication, the transfer interval
indicates the time elapsed between any two consecutive message delivered
by the automation application to the ingress of the communication system
(see Clause A.4).

*Message size*

The user data length indicates the (maximum) size of the user data
packet delivered from the application to the ingress of the
communication system and from the egress of the communication system to
the application. For periodic communication this parameter can be used
for calculating the requested user-experienced data rate (see Clause
A.4). If this parameter is not provided, the default is the maximum
value supported by the PDU type (e.g. Ethernet PDU: maximum frame length
is 1522 octets, IP PDU: maximum packet length is 65535 octets).

5.1 Rail-bound mass transit
---------------------------

### 5.1*.*1 Description of vertical

In order to keep the attractiveness of public transport high, some of
the key challenges mass transit operators are facing are

\- growing traffic, both in terms of passenger flow and the number of
and frequency of mass transit vehicles;

\- the need to ensure passenger safety and security;

\- improvement of travel comfort, including delivery of real-time
multimedia information and access to the internet (social networks,
etc.), both in stations and on trains.

To reach this goal, investments are not only needed in rolling stock and
infrastructure, but also in communication networks, communication
technologies, and communication end devices.

#### 5.1*.*1.1 Communication services in rail-bound mass transit

There are two main drivers behind the growing importance of
communication services in mass transit: (1) passenger information and
internet access and (2) train automation. The latter can be divided into
control and operations. Both types of train automation consist of
distributed applications that rely on dependable communication.
Typically, control applications are of higher priority than operational
applications, and the latter are typically of higher priority than
passenger services. One of the main challenges is to guarantee the
premium priority of control-related communication over other types of
communication, especially since the data bandwidth consumed for control
is typically dwarfed by data traffic stemming from the other two
application areas. Another challenge is to guarantee the super priority
of operational data communication over passenger-related communication.
Automation in public transport, especially in mass transit, has reached
one of the highest levels of automation among infrastructure
applications. Nowadays, driverless metro systems are not science
fiction, rather they become increasingly pervasive. The number of
driverless metro lines worldwide already exceeds 100, and this number is
expected to grow. Note that driverless trains are not the only source of
automation in mass transit, and thus not the only source of dependable
machine-type communication. For instance, mass transit train control
assisted by rail-to-rail-side wireless communication (MTTC), which is at
the core of driverless trains, is also used for trains exhibiting lower
grades of automation. Examples for MTTC are communication-based train
control (CBTC) \[7\] and Korea Radio-Based Train Control System (KRTCS)
\[5\]\[6\]. The grades of automation of trains are specified in IEC
62290-1 \[4\] and are summarised in Figure 5.1.1.1-1.

Figure 5.1.1.1-1: The different grades of automation (GoA) in rail
systems

Caused by increased safety awareness, onboard video surveillance/CCTV
and emergency calls play an increasing role in rolling-stock equipment.
In GoA 4 systems (see Figure 5.1.1.1-1), both applications are mandatory
in order to setup communication with passenger during emergencies, e.g.,
when trains have to stop inside tunnels. Onboard video surveillance/CCTV
system generates also excessive amount of video recordings, which need
to be archived and ultimately offloaded/ transferred from onboard into
the ground storage. Additional operational applications are train
diagnostics and voice communication for operational, service and
maintenance purposes. Other common applications for increasing passenger
satisfaction are passenger information (PIS), online advertisement, and
online internet access. Figure 5.1.1.1-2 provides an overview of the
common data services in contemporary mass transit trains.

transit, (not all services listed are shown in the diagram)

#### 5.1*.*1.2 Characteristics of main mass-transit data services

In a first level of consideration, mass-transit data services differ in
directionality and bandwidth. For instance, MTTC is a bidirectional data
service, while CCTV traffic mainly flows from train to track-side
destinations (uplink). In contrast, the PIS communication pattern is
almost reverse (dominance of downlink traffic).

In Table 5.1.1.2-1, a selection of mass-transit data services is
characterised by different attributes such as data rate, directionality,
and priority. The latter, which are not standardised, are provided for
guidance.

As Table 5.1.1.2-1 shows, MTTC is a very demanding data service, since
every related attribute―except data rate―is at the highest requirement
level. Other important services, from an operational point of view, are
CCTV and emergency voice connections. Internet access, on the other
hand, requires high aggregate data rates while it represents the least
important operation-related service of all. The maximum bit-error ratio
for control messages, e.g., MTTC messages, is 10^-6^.

Table 5.1.1.2-2 translates the above qualitative services into typical
data rates for a commuter train.

MTTC only consumes some hundred kbit/s in contrast to around 100 Mbit/s
for passenger internet access. Also, the number of networked devices per
train varies considerably from one service to the other. MTTC is at the
very low end of the list. The big number for passenger internet access
stems from the fact that passenger end devices, e.g., smart phones,
significantly outnumber automation data sources and data sinks and that
many automation devices consume comparably low data rates. Due to
constantly increasing minimum resolutions for CCTV cameras, currently
reaching up to approximately 4 Mbit/s per camera, the data rate
requirements of live real-time CCTV reaches close to that of overall
data rate of Passenger internet Access. Furthermore, the CCTV offload,
which means the transfer of CCTV archives from train to ground when the
train stops at the stations or at the depot, requires relatively high
overall data rate, similar to that required by long haul trains, i.e.,
minimum of 1 Gb/s. The transfer CCTV offload is even more challenging in
commuter trains than in long haul trains due to shorter stop times.

Note that communication service reliability is also an important
parameter for mass-transit communication. However, commonly agreed upon
values do not exist. As a rule of thumb, the time between communication
service failures needs to be maximised.

Also note that some mass-transit applications are comparably immune to
intermittent communication service dropouts. In case the unavailability
of the communication service is shorter than a pre-defined time (for
MTTC typically around 500 ms), the communicating applications do not
experience the service as unavailable. However, if the dropout exceeds
this time limit, it counts as a communication service failure. As a
general rule, the time to repair the communication service should be
kept as short as feasible.

### 5.1.2 Coexistence of MTTC service and CCTV

#### 5.1.2*.*1 Description

This use case considers the behaviour of a high-priority MTTC service in
presence of a CCTV high-priority data service. The former is
characterised by rather low data rates and the latter by rather high
data rates (see Table 5.1.1.2-1). In this use case CCTV is streamed in
real time to the rail-side, for instance to a traffic control centre.

#### 5.1.2.2 Preconditions

The high-priority service MTTC is switched on and communication between
train and ground-based train control units ensues. The priority level of
MTTC is 1 (highest level). Train-borne and ground MTTC instances are
exchanging data. The exchange fulfils the required data rate and other
relevant service parameters (see Table 5.1.1.2-1). All other data
services are switched off.

#### 5.1.2.3 Service flows

The CCTV service is switched on. The priority of this data service is 2
(one level lower than MTTC). All other data services are switched off.

The CCTV service is switched on. The desired data rate of the CCTV
service is negotiated (typically at least 100 Mbit/s). CCTV data
connections between track and train are established (CCTV cameras are
switched on and video streams relayed to a track-side video management
system, a.k.a. the CCTV data sink).

#### 5.1.2.4 Post-conditions

> \- The MTTC QoS parameters stay in the desired range while the CCTV
> service is running;
>
> \- the CCTV QoS parameters stay in the desired range.

#### 5.1.2.5 Challenges to the 5G system

> \- Isolation of communication flows;
>
> \- guarantee of user experienced data rates;
>
> \- high communication service availability;
>
> \- high communication service reliability.

### 5.1.3 Coexistence of MTTC service and a high data rate service with low priority

#### 5.1.3*.*1 Description

This use case considers the behaviour of MTTC in presence of another
data service with low priority but very high data rates. An example for
this other service is passenger internet access.

#### 5.1.3.2 Preconditions

MTTC is switched on and communication between train and ground is
maintained. The priority of the MTTC service is set to the highest
value. Train-borne and ground MTTC instances are exchanging data with
required data rate and other specified service parameters. All other
data services are switched off.

#### 5.1.3.3 Service flows

Another data service with different service parameters is switched on.
The priority of this data service is the lowest. An example service is
passenger internet access service.

The additional service is switched on. The desired data rate of the
additional service is set to, e.g., 100 Mbit/s. A pursuant data
connection between track and train is established. After successful
initialisation of the additional service, the QoS of the MTTC is
unaffected, even if the data rate of the additional service is increased
up to 500 Mbit/s.

#### 5.1.3.4 Post-conditions

The MTTC QoS parameters are in the specified range, even when the other
data service is running at the highest permissible data rate.

A                             \[This requirement is not covered yet by existing 3GPP requirements\]

### 5.1.4 Coexistence of MTTC service and high data rate service with low priority

#### 5.1.4*.*1 Description

This use case considers the behaviour of the start up of the MTTC
service in case of other already running data services.

#### 5.1.4.2 Preconditions

MTTC is switched off. Data services that consume significant bandwidth
are running. Examples for such services are

> \- CCTV;
>
> \- PIS;
>
> \- emergency voice;
>
> \- passenger internet access;
>
> \- train diagnostics.

The communication service for each application is characterised by an
individual set of QoS parameters. The resulting data rate per train is
500 Mbit/s and lower.

#### 5.1.4.3 Service flows

The MTTC service is switched on.

Trackside and train-borne MTTC instances boot and communication between
both commence.

After the MTTC start-up procedure, the MTTC service is entering the data
exchange mode.

### 5.1.5 Set-up of emergency call

#### 5.1.5*.*1 Description

This use case considers setting up emergency calls while other data
services are running.

NOTE: This use case deals with emergency calls using the train and rail
infrastructure and not public emergency services. An example for a train
emergency system is microphone/speaker boxes that are integrated into
the walls of the passenger area.

#### 5.1.5.2 Preconditions

The high priority emergency voice service is in standby mode. The
corresponding voice call devices are switched on.

Examples for such services are

> \- Real-time CCTV;
>
> \- PIS;
>
> \- emergency voice;
>
> \- passenger internet access;
>
> \- diagnostics.

The communication service, for each application, is characterised by an
individual set of QoS parameters. The resulting data rate per train is
500 Mbit/s and lower.

#### 5.1.5.3 Service flows

An emergency voice call is initiated. Trackside and train-borne voice
communication between them commences.

#### 5.1.5.4 Post-conditions

A successful voice call between train and track side devices is
established.

### 5.1.8 Wireless communication between mechanically coupled train segments

#### 5.1.8*.*1 Description

Two mass transit coaches or trains are mechanically coupled together.
The communication between both (control, operational, passenger
services) is going to be provided via a 5G RAN link. For the sake of
simplicity we henceforth refer to coaches as trains.

#### 5.1.8.2 Preconditions

Services are running in both trains. Typically, these services are of an
operational nature, but they can also include control and passenger
services. The two trains are coupled together mechanically, but
communication between both trains is not established yet.

#### 5.1.8.3 Service flows

A wireless 5G link is established between the two trains.

#### 5.1.8.4 Post-conditions

Communication services between both trains are established via the 5G
wireless link and run dependably.

#### 5.1.8.5 Challenges to the 5G system

\- Guarantee of very high user experienced data rates over a short air
gap.

\- Very high communication service availability;

\- Very high communication service reliability.

#### 5.1.8.6 Potential requirements

### 5.1.9 Wireless communication between virtually coupled trains

#### 5.1.9.1 Description

One of the important missions that the future railway service should
achieve is to increase its transport capacity and operational
efficiency. A straight-forward solution is to minimise the distance
between successive mass transit trains so that mass transit interval is
reduced. It is difficult to do so in a legacy mass transit system,
because the distance between two successive mass transit trains should
be larger than the safety braking distance.

The distance between successive trains can be shortened if the following
mass transit train immediately triggers braking as soon as the leading
mass transit train starts braking. This is the fundamental principle of
the virtual coupling. Figure 5.1.9.1-1 shows the basic concept of the
virtual coupling. Multiple mass transit trains in proximity move
together *as if they are mechanically coupled*. As two trains get
closer, trains need to communicate each other more frequently through a
very-low-latency off-network communication link for control,
operational, and passenger services. The communication between the
virtually coupled trains is provided through both on-network and
off-network communication links simultaneously for complementary use of
both links.

Figure 5.1.9.1-1: The concept of virtual coupling

#### 5.1.9.2 Pre-conditions

> 1\. Control, operational, and passenger services are running in both
> leading and following mass transit trains. Both trains are configured
> to be coupled virtually.
>
> 2\. Two mass transit trains are connected through an on-network (e.g.,
> Uu interface). Each mass transit train is capable of off-network
> communications (e.g., PC5 interface).

#### 5.1.9.3 Service flows

As the following train approaches the leading train, a very-low-latency
off-network communication link is established between two trains. Two
mass transit trains are still connected through the on-network
communication link for complementary use of both links.

#### 5.1.9.4 Post-conditions

Control, operational, and passenger communication services between
virtually coupled trains are established through both on-network and
off-network communication links simultaneously.

#### 5.1.9.5 Challenges to the 5G system

\- Guarantee of very long communication range for off-network
communication link

\- Very low end-to-end latency for off-network communication link

\- Service continuity in the application layer between on-network and
off-network

### 5.1.10 Anticipatory train control

#### 5.1.10*.*1 Description

MTTC relies on continuous run-time connectivity between train and track
side. This connectivity is currently typically realised by aid of
wireless technologies such as Wireless LAN and LTE (R11). In case the
connectivity between an \"MTTC train\" and the track side becomes
unavailable, the train stops. Rather tedious procedures have to be
executed before the train may continue its journey. These procedures can
take up to several minutes. Also---if more than one train shares the
same line---one train\'s emergency stop will bring all trains on this
line to a halt. For these reasons, solutions are sought in which the
loss of connectivity between track and track side is alleviated.

#### 5.1.10.2 Preconditions

A \"MTTC train\" is connected to a 5G system that provides the mandatory
connectivity to the track side. The \"MTTC train\" provides passenger
service along a mass transit line.

#### 5.1.10.3 Service flows

The 5G system informs the \"MTTC train\" of degraded connectivity in a
radio cell of the 5G system down the train line. This information
includes the (approximate) size and intersection of the radio cell with
the train line. The degraded connectivity will result in the loss of
connectivity between the train control and the track side. The train
control utilises this information for compensatory changes to its travel
profile and/or the consumed radio connectivity.

*Changes to the travel profile*

The train reacts to the degradation of the radio connectivity down the
train line through anticipatory changes to the travel profile. For
instance, the train (progressively) lowers the train speed. In case
connectivity in the affected radio cell is recovered the train can
(progressively) increase its speed again. By so doing, emergency brakes
and lengthy stand stills are avoided. Also, since the ratio of released
power vs. usable mechanical power (used for propelling and controlling
the train) decreases concavely with train speed, substantial amounts of
power can be saved in case the train partially decelerates instead of
coming to a complete halt. Partial deceleration is in essence more
readily and easily reversible than a \"go-no-go\" pattern. Thus, a
slightly decelerating train will be more energy efficient than one
coming to intermittent full stops. The change in velocity and thus the
predicted route can also be exchanged with other trains on the same line
(and the same direction of travel), so that they can adapt their travel
profile in a suitable way. This exchange can, for instance, take place
via a central instance or between adjacent trains.

*Adaptation of the radio connectivity*

In case the radio channel degrades gracefully, and in case more than one
communication relationship exists between track-side and train, the
train can evaluate whether an intermittent discontinuation of a
lower-priority service is possible, so that the degraded channel
capacity is reserved for mission-critical communication. For instance,
if the train currently offloads archived video footage, the train
control can decide to intermittently discontinue the related
communication service.

Another potential adaptation is the exploitation of receiver diversity.
Trains are equipped with a least two UEs (at opposite ends of the
train), and for long trains the link budget for these UEs can be quite
different. In that case, the UEs with the better link budget can be
chosen as primary receiver.

#### 5.1.10.4 Post-conditions

Connectivity is restored in the radio cell in question and the train
control is appraised of this change. The train control takes appropriate
actions.

#### 5.1.10.5 Challenges to the 5G system

> \- Signalling of communication service availability to users and a
> dedicated interface for so doing.

5.2 Building automation
-----------------------

### 5.2*.*1 Description of vertical

Building automation \[9\] refers to the management of equipment in
buildings such as heaters, coolers, and ventilators. Automation of such
systems brings several benefits, including the reduction of energy
consumption, the improvement of comfort level for people using the
building, and the handling of failure and emergency situations. Sensors
installed in the building perform measurements of the environment and
report these measurements to Local Controllers. Local Controllers (LC),
in turn, report these results to a Building Management System.

A Building Management System (BMS) may then execute different
operations:

\- Store the information into a database (e.g., for histogram purpose);

\- Send an alarm to a (third-party) Building Management System;

\- The Building Management System sends a command to an actuator (e.g.,
command to increase room temperature, turn on a light).

height="4.035416666666666in"}

Figure 5.2.1.-2: Building automation system with Building Management
System as part of Mobile Edge Computing system

NOTE: In existing building automation systems there are typically two
layers of network: the upper layer is called management network and the
lower one is called field network. In management networks, an IP-based
communication protocol is used. In field network, non-IP based
communication protocols (a.k.a., field protocols) are mainly used. There
are many field protocols used in today\'s deployment in which some
medium access control and physical layers protocols are standards-based
and others are proprietary based. The impact of such protocols in 3GPP
requirements is FFS.

### 5.2.2 Environmental monitoring

#### 5.2.2*.*1 Description

In this use case, several sensors are installed in a building and each
sensor performs measurements following a pre-defined measurement
interval. The measurement data might be used for drawing a histogram
with as detailed as 1 s granularity and a 10 times sampling rate, i.e.,
10 times per second. A Local Controller collects the measurement data
from its sensors and may transmit it to the Building Management System
at a certain interval. The latency in this use case is not a concern,
but it is important that the transmission is reliable and all sensor
values are collected within the measurement interval.

#### 5.2.2.2 Preconditions

There are several Local Controllers installed in the building, each
connected with many sensors (up to 100 sensors).

#### 5.2.2.3 Service flows

At the measurement interval, which might be as low as 1 second, and with
the needed sampling rate (e.g., 10/s), the Local Controller sends a
request to all its sensors in the building to report their measurements.

#### 5.2.2.4 Post-conditions

Every sensor reports their measurements and measurements are received
with 99,999% reliability. The Local Controller collects these
measurements and may transmit them to the building management System.

#### 5.2.3*.*1 Description

In this use case, when fire is detected, the system triggers several
actions, such as closing fire shutters and turning on fire sprinklers.

5.3 Factories of the Future 
---------------------------

### 5.3.1 Description of vertical

#### 5.3.1.1 Overview

The manufacturing industry is currently subject to a fundamental change,
which is often referred to as the \"Fourth Industrial Revolution\" or
simply \"Industry 4.0\" \[27\]. The main goals of Industry 4.0 are
―among others― the improvement of flexibility, versatility, resource
efficiency, cost efficiency, worker support, and quality of industrial
production and logistics. These improvements are important for
addressing the needs of increasingly volatile and globalised markets. A
major enabler for all this are cyber-physical production systems based
on a ubiquitous and powerful connectivity and computing infrastructure,
which interconnects people, machines, products, and all kinds of other
devices in a flexible, secure and consistent manner. Instead of static
sequential production systems, future smart factories will be
characterised by flexible, modular production systems. This includes
more mobile and versatile production assets, which require powerful and
efficient wireless communication and localisation services.

Today, the vast majority of communication technologies used in industry
is still wire-bound. This includes a variety of dedicated Industrial
Ethernet technologies (e.g., Sercos®, PROFINET® and EtherCAT®) and
fieldbuses (e.g., PROFIBUS®, CC-Link® and CAN®) \[28\]\[29\]\[30\].
These communication technologies are used, for example, for
interconnecting sensors, actuators and controllers in an automation
system. Nowadays, wireless communication is primarily used for special
applications and scenarios, for example in the process industry, or for
connecting standard IT hardware to a production network and similar
rather non-critical applications. On the one hand, this is because there
was no need for wireless connectivity in the past, due to relatively
static and long-lasting production facilities. On the other hand, this
is because most existing wireless technologies fall short of the
demanding requirements of industrial applications, especially with
respect to end-to-end latency, communication service availability,
jitter, and determinism. With the advent of Industry 4.0 and 5G,
however, this may change fundamentally, since only wireless connectivity
can provide the degree of flexibility, mobility, versatility, and
ergonomics that is required for the Factories of the Future. Thus, 5G
may significantly contribute to revolutionising the way how goods are
produced, shipped, and serviced throughout their whole lifecycle.

In this respect, several different application areas can be
distinguished, as shown in Figure 5.3.1.1-1.

![](media/image21.emf){width="3.7618055555555556in" height="2.75in"}

Figure 5.3.1.1-1: Overview of the different application areas of the
vertical \"Factories of the Future\"

These areas can be briefly characterised as follows:

> **1) Factory automation:** Factory automation deals with the automated
> control, monitoring and optimisation of processes and workflows within
> a factory. This includes aspects like closed-loop control applications
> (e.g., based on programmable logic or motion controllers), robotics,
> as well as aspects of computer-integrated manufacturing. Factory
> automation generally represents a key enabler for industrial mass
> production with high quality and cost-efficiency and corresponding
> applications are often characterised by highest requirements on the
> underlying connectivity infrastructure, especially in terms of
> latency, communication service availability and determinism. In the
> Factories of the Future, static sequential production systems will be
> more and more replaced by novel modular production systems offering a
> high flexibility and versatility. This involves a large number of
> increasingly mobile production assets, for which powerful wireless
> communication and localisation services are required.
>
> **2) Process automation:** Process automation refers to the control of
> production and handling of substances like chemicals, food & beverage,
> etc. Process automation improves the efficiency of production
> processes, energy consumption and safety of the facilities. Sensors
> measuring process values, such as pressures or temperatures, are
> working in a closed loop via centralised and decentralised controllers
> with actuators, e.g., valves, pumps, heaters. Also monitoring of
> attributes such as the filling levels of tanks, quality of material or
> environmental data are important, as well as safety warnings or plant
> shut downs. Workers in the plant are supported by mobile devices. A
> process automation facility may range from a few 100 m² to km² or may
> be geographically distributed over a certain geographic region.
> Depending on the size, a production plant may have several 10 000
> measurement points and actuators. Autarkic device power supply for
> years is needed in order to stay flexible and to keep the total costs
> of ownership low.
>
> **3) HMIs and Production IT:** Human-machine interfaces (HMIs) include
> all sorts of devices for the interaction between people and production
> facilities, such as panels attached to a machine or production line,
> but also standard IT devices, such as laptops, tablet PCs,
> smartphones, etc. In addition to that, also augmented and virtual
> reality (AR/VR) applications are expected to play an increasingly
> important role in future, which may be enabled by special AR/VR
> glasses, but also by more standard devices, such as tablet PCs or the
> like.

Production IT, on the other hand, encompasses IT-based applications,
such as manufacturing execution systems (MES) as well as enterprise
resource planning (ERP) systems. The overall goal of an MES system, for
example, is to monitor and document how raw materials and/or basic
components are transformed into finished goods, whereas an ERP system
generally provide an integrated and continuously updated view of
important business processes. Both systems rely on the timely
availability of large amounts of data from the production process.\
\
Since both HMIs and Production IT are more related to traditional IT
systems than to factory-specific operational technology (OT) systems,
they are bundled in one application area.

> **- Logistics and warehousing:** Logistics and warehousing refers to
> the organisation and control of the flow and storage of materials and
> goods in the context of industrial production. In this respect,
> intra-logistics is dealing with logistics within a certain property
> (e.g., within a factory), for example by ensuring the uninterrupted
> supply of raw materials on the shop floor level using automated guided
> vehicles (AGVs), fork lifts, etc. This is to be seen in contrast to
> logistics between different sites, for example for the transport of
> goods from a supplier to a factory or from a factory to the end
> customer. Warehousing particularly refers to the storage of materials
> and goods, which is also getting more and more automated, for example
> based on conveyors, cranes and automated storage and retrieval
> systems. For all kinds of logistics applications, generally also the
> localisation, tracking and monitoring of assets is of high importance.
>
> **- Monitoring and maintenance:** Monitoring and maintenance refers to
> the monitoring of certain processes and/or assets without an immediate
> impact on the processes themselves (in contrast to a typical
> closed-loop control system in factory automation, for example). This
> particularly includes applications such as condition monitoring and
> predictive maintenance based on sensor data, but also big data
> analytics for optimising future parameter sets of a certain process,
> for instance. For these use cases, the data acquisition process is
> typically not latency-critical, but a large number of sensors may have
> to be efficiently interconnected, especially since many of these
> sensors may only be battery-driven.

For each of these application areas, a multitude of potential use cases
exists, some of which are outlined in the following Clauses. These use
cases can be mapped to the given application areas as shown in Table
5.3.1.1-1.

#### 5.3.1.2 Major challenges and particularities

Major general challenges and particularities of the Factories of the
Future include the following aspects:

> 1\) Industrial-grade quality of service is required for many
> applications, with stringent requirements in terms of end-to-end
> latency, communication service availability, jitter, and determinism.
>
> 2\) There is not only a single class of use cases, but there are many
> different use cases with a wide variety of different requirements,
> thus resulting in the need for a high adaptability and scalability of
> the 5G system.
>
> 3\) Many applications have stringent requirements on safety, security
> (esp. availability, data integrity, and confidentiality), and privacy.
>
> 4\) The 5G system has to support a seamless integration into the
> existing (primarily wire-bound) connectivity infrastructure. For
> example, the 5G shall allow to flexibly combine the 5G system with
> other (wire-bound) technologies in the same machine or production
> line.
>
> 5\) Production facilities usually have a rather long lifetime, which
> may be 20 years or even longer. Therefore, long-term availability of
> 5G communication services and components are essential.
>
> 6\) 5G systems shall support non-public operation by deploying type-a
> network or type-b network within a factory or plant, which are
> isolated from PLMNs. This is required by many factory/plant owners for
> security, liability, availability and business reasons. Nevertheless,
> in the case of a type-a network is deployed standardised and flexible
> interfaces shall be supported for seamless interoperability and
> seamless handovers between 5G PLMNs and non-public 5G systems.
>
> 7\) The radio propagation environment in a factory or plant can be
> quite different from the situation in other application areas of the
> 5G system. It is typically characterised by very rich multipath,
> caused by a large number of---often metallic---objects in the
> immediate surroundings of transmitter and receiver, as well as
> potentially high interference caused by electric machines, arc
> welding, and the like.
>
> 8\) The 5G system shall be able to support continuous monitoring of
> the current network state in real-time, to take quick and automated
> actions in case of problems and to do efficient root-cause analyses in
> order to avoid any undesired interruption of the production processes,
> which may incur huge financial damage. Particularly if a third-party
> network operator is involved, accurate SLA monitoring is needed as the
> basis for possible liability disputes in case of SLA violations.

#### 5.3.1.3 Deployment aspects

Separate communication services may need to be provided for different
application areas. Note that \"separate\" communication service can be
physically, logically or virtually separate.

The application area \"factory automation\" consists of the use cases
\"motion control\", \"control-to-control\", \"mobile robots\" and
\"massive wireless sensor networks\". Communication services for factory
automation meet stringent requirements; and operation is limited to a
relatively small service area where no interaction with the public
network (e.g., service continuity, roaming) is required.

The application area \"process automation\" consists of the use cases
\"mobile robots\", \"massive wireless sensor networks\", \"closed-loop
process control\", \"process monitoring\" and \"plant asset
management\". Communication services for process automation meet
stringent requirements. Interaction with the public network (e.g.,
service continuity, roaming) is required.

The application area \"HMIs and production IT\" consists of the use
cases \"mobile control panels with safety\" and \"augmented reality\".
Communication services for HMIs and Production IT meet stringent
requirements; and are limited to a local service area where no
interaction with the public network (e.g., service continuity, roaming)
is required.

The application area \"logistics and warehousing\" consists of the use
cases \"control-to-control\" and \"mobile robots\". Communication
service for logistics and warehousing meet very stringent requirements;
and are limited to a local service area (both indoor and outdoor).
Interaction with the public network (e.g., service continuity, roaming)
is required.

The application area \"monitoring and maintenance\" consists of the use
cases \"massive wireless sensor networks\" and \"remote access and
maintenance\". Communication services for monitoring and maintenance
meet stringent requirements; and are limited to a local service area
(both indoor and outdoor). Interaction with the public network (e.g.,
service continuity, roaming) is required.

### 5.3.2 Motion control

#### 5.3.2*.*1 Description

Motion control is among the most challenging and demanding closed-loop
control applications in industry. A motion control system is responsible
for controlling moving and/or rotating parts of machines in a
well-defined manner, for example in printing machines, machine tools or
packaging machines. Due to the movements/rotations of components,
wireless communications based on powerful 5G systems constitutes a
promising approach. On the one hand this is because with wirelessly
connected devices, slip rings, cable carriers, etc.―which are typically
used for these applications today―can be avoided, thus reducing
abrasion, maintenance effort and costs. On the other hand, this is
because machines and production lines may be built with less
restrictions, allowing for novel (and potentially much more compact and
modular) setups.

A schematic representation of a motion control system is depicted in
Figure 5.3.2.1-1. A motion controller periodically sends desired set
points to one or several actuators (e.g., a linear actuator or a servo
drive) which thereupon perform a corresponding action on one or several
processes (in this case usually a movement or rotation of a certain
component). At the same time, sensors determine the current state of the
process(es) (in this case for example the current position and/or
rotation of one or multiple components) and send the actual values back
to the motion controller. This is done in a strictly cyclic and
deterministic manner, such that during one communication cycle time
*T*~cycle~ the motion controller sends updated set points to all
actuators, and all sensors send their actual values back to the motion
controller. Nowadays, typically Industrial Ethernet technologies are
used for motion control systems. Examples for such technologies are
Sercos®, PROFINET® IRT or EtherCAT®, which support cycle times below 50
µs. In general, lower cycle times allow for faster and more accurate
movements/rotations.

height="1.523611111111111in"}

Figure 5.3.2.1-1: Schematic representation of a motion control system

While it might be possible to move away from the strictly cyclic
communication pattern for motion control systems in the long-term, it is
hard to do so in the short-term since the whole ecosystem (tools,
machines, communication technologies, servo drives, etc.) is based on
the cyclic communication paradigm. In order to support a seamless
migration path, the 5G system therefore should support such a highly
deterministic cyclic data communication service.

Furthermore, there are many scenarios where some devices (e.g., sensors
or actuators) are added / activated or removed / deactivated while the
overall control system keeps on running. In order to support such cases,
hot-plugging support is required without any (observable) impact on the
rest of the system.

Table 5.3.2.1-1 shows some typical values for the number of nodes, cycle
times and payload sizes for some of the most important application areas
of motion control systems. However, it should be noted that these values
may vary widely in practice and that not all sensors and/or actuators in
a motion control system may have to be connected using a 5G system.
Instead, it is expected that there will be a seamless coexistence
between Industrial Ethernet and the 5G system in the future.

Table 5.3.2.1-1: Typical characteristics of motion control systems for
three major applications

  **Application**     **\# of sensors / actuators**   **Typical message size**   **Cycle time *T*~cycle~**   **Service area**
  ------------------- ------------------------------- -------------------------- --------------------------- ----------------------
  Printing Machine    \> 100                          20 byte                    \< 2 ms                     100 m x 100 m x 30 m
  Machine Tool        \~ 20                           50 byte                    \< 0.5 ms                   15 m x 15 m x 3 m
  Packaging Machine   \~ 50                           40 byte                    \< 1 ms                     10 m x 5 m x 3 m

In general, this use case has the most stringent requirements in terms
of latency and service availability. The operation is limited to a
relatively small service area, where no interaction with the public
network (e.g., service continuity, roaming) is required.

#### 5.3.2.2 Preconditions

All sensors, actuators and the motion controller are switched on and
connected to the 5G system.

#### 5.3.2.3 Service flows

Within each communication cycle of duration *T*~cycle~, the following
steps are performed in a strictly cyclic manner:

> 1\) The motion controller sends set points to all actuators.
>
> 2\) The actuators take these set points and put them into an internal
> buffer.
>
> 3\) All sensors transmit their current actual values from their
> internal buffer to the motion controller.
>
> 4\) At a well-defined time instant within the current cycle, which is
> commonly referred to as the \"global sampling point\", the actuators
> retrieve the latest set points received from the motion controller
> from their internal buffer and act accordingly on the process(es) (see
> Figure 5.3.2.1-1). At exactly the same time, the sensors determine the
> current state of the process(es) and put them as new actual values in
> their internal buffer, ready to be transmitted to the motion
> controller. It is important that there is a very high synchronicity in
> the order of 1 µs between all involved devices (motion controller,
> sensors, actuators) with respect to this global sampling point.

All messages exchanged have to be properly secured (especially in terms
of data integrity and authenticity) and the probability of two
consecutive packet errors shall be negligible. This is because a single
packet error may be tolerable, but two consecutive packet errors may
damage a machine and may lead to a production downtime with possibly
huge financial damage.

Some of the sensors/actuators may be moving and/or rotating, with
typical maximum speeds up to about 20 m/s.

#### 5.3.2.4 Post-conditions

The components controlled by the motion control system move/rotate as
requested by the motion controller.

#### 5.3.2.5 Challenges to the 5G system

> Special challenges to the 5G system associated with this use case
> include the following aspects:
>
> Very stringent requirements on latency, communication service
> availability, and determinism.
>
> Very stringent requirements on clock synchronicity between different
> nodes.
>
> Transmission of rather small chunks of data, resulting in potentially
> significant relative overhead due to signalling, security, etc.
>
> Potentially high density of UEs (sensors/actuators)

### 5.3.3 Motion control -- transmission of non-real-time data

#### 5.3.3*.*1 Description

In this use case, some additional non-real-time (NRT) data are
transmitted from the motion controller to one or several nodes (cf.
Figure 5.3.2.1-1). This is done in parallel to the regular cyclic data
transmission service as described in the previous clause. Examples for
this NRT data are software/firmware updates or maintenance information.

#### 5.3.3.2 Preconditions

All sensors, actuators and the motion controller are switched on and
connected to the 5G system. The strictly cyclic data communication
service between the motion controller and the sensors/actuators has been
successfully set up (see previous use case) and is running.

#### 5.3.3.3 Service flows

The cyclic data communication service as described in the previous
clause is running without any interruptions. In addition to that, the
following service flow occurs, assuming a downstream NRT data
transmission from the motion controller to one (or several) sensor(s)
and/or actuator(s):

> 1\) The motion controller initiates a NRT data transmission service to
> one or several sensor(s)/actuator(s).
>
> 2\) The motion controller transmits the NRT data to the respective
> sensor(s)/actuator(s) with a data rate of at least 1 Mbit/s.
>
> 3\) The recipient(s) confirm(s) the successful reception of the NRT
> data.
>
> 4\) The NRT data transmission service is disengaged.

An alternative flow with an upstream NRT data transmission service may
look as follows:

> 1\) A sensor/actuator requests a NRT data transmission service to the
> motion controller
>
> 2\) The motion controller approves the request to establish a NRT data
> transmission service from the requesting sensor/actuator to the motion
> controller.
>
> 3\) The respective sensor/actuator initiates a NRT data transmission
> service to the motion controller.
>
> 4\) The respective sensor/actuator transmits the NRT data to the
> motion controller with a data rate of at least 1 Mbit/s.
>
> 5\) The motion controller confirms the successful reception of the NRT
> data.
>
> 6\) The NRT data transmission service is disengaged.

#### 5.3.3.4 Post-conditions

The NRT data has been successfully transmitted.

The strictly cyclic data communication service between the motion
controller and the sensors/ actuators has not been affected.

#### 5.3.3.5 Challenges to the 5G system

Special challenges to the 5G system associated with this use case
include the following aspects:

> Simultaneous transmission of non-critical NRT data and highly-critical
> motion control data with highest requirements in terms of latency and
> communication service availability over the same link and to the same
> device
>
> Dynamic and efficient establishment and disengagement of NRT data
> transmission services

### 5.3.4 Motion control -- seamless integration with Industrial Ethernet

#### 5.3.4*.*1 Description

In this use case, not all sensors and actuators in a motion control
system are connected using a 5G system. Instead, a single motion control
system could integrate components of a wire-bound Industrial Ethernet
system and components of a 5G system. Therefore the 5G system must
support the seamless integration and interplay with Industrial Ethernet.

height="3.7979166666666666in"}

Figure 5.3.4.1-1: Example for an industrial Ethernet network including
5G links for motion control

#### 5.3.4.2 Preconditions

Sensors, actuators and motion controller are switched on and some of
them are connected using a 5G system and the others are connected using
Industrial Ethernet. The interconnection between Industrial Ethernet and
5G is realised using gateway UEs connected to Ethernet switches or a
device is connected directly to a PDN using an Ethernet adapter.

#### 5.3.4.3 Service flows

The conditions for cyclic and NRT communication flows apply to this use
case, with the addition that communication flows are initiated on
devices connected via (Industrial) Ethernet and directed to devices
connected via 5G or vice versa.

As Industrial Ethernet typically operates on the Ethernet Data Link
layer (Layer 2), the communication flow establishment can only be
successful if the 5G network is able to forward frames from Ethernet
sources towards 5G destinations and vice versa. In general this also
includes the handling of broadcast packets.

The Ethernet devices of a single motion control could be separated from
others on the same physical Ethernet network using Virtual LAN (IEEE
802.1Q). Therefore the 5G system must be aware of the Virtual LAN
associations when forwarding Ethernet frames. Furthermore, the Virtual
LANs Priority Code Point assignment could be utilised to determine the
5G traffic priority.

The precise time synchronisation between multiple motions controllers
connected to Industrial Ethernet and 5G may be realised using the
Precise Time Protocol (IEEE 1588). This protocol enables the estimation
of clock offsets between network end-points and in this case the motion
controllers. The support of IEEE 1588 in a 5G system introduces the
expedited processing and transmission of certain messages at any of the
intermediate devices in the communication path.

A single motion control might share the available network resources with
other applications. Current and future Industrial Ethernet protocols
offer the reservation of network resources to overcome communication
bottlenecks. Since resource reservation considers the complete
communication path, the flow of resource reservation is introduced to
the 5G system. The 5G system could be aware of the standard Ethernet
protocols as e.g., Time-Aware Scheduling defined in IEEE 802.1Qbv.

#### 5.3.4.4 Post-conditions

The components controlled by the motion control system move/rotate as
requested by the motion controller.

#### 5.3.4.5 Challenges to the 5G system

Special challenges to the 5G system associated with this use case
include the following aspects:

> Seamless integration with (Industrial) Ethernet systems.
>
> Support of certain mechanisms of the IEEE 802.1 protocol family,
> including IEEE 802.1Qbv (time-aware scheduling) and IEEE 802.1Q
> (VLANs).
>
> Support of time synchronisation based on IEEE 1588.

### 5.3.5 Control-to-control communication (motion subsystems)

#### 5.3.5*.*1 Description

Control-to-control (C2C) communication, i.e., the communication between
different industrial controllers (e.g., programmable logic controllers
or motion controllers) is already used today for a number of different
use cases, such as the following ones:

> Large machines (e.g., newspaper printing machines), where several
> controls are used to cluster machine functions, which need to
> communicate with each other. These controls typically need to be
> synchronised and exchange real-time data.
>
> Individual machines that are used for fulfilling a common task (e.g.,
> machines in an assembly line) often need to communicate, for example
> for controlling and coordinating the handover of work pieces from one
> machine to another.

Typically, a C2C network has no fixed configuration of certain controls
that need to be present. The control nodes present in the network often
vary with the status of machines and the manufacturing plant as a whole.
Therefore, hot-plugging support for different control nodes is important
and often used.

Protocols that are used for C2C communications today include Industrial
Ethernet standards, such as Sercos, PROFINET®, and EtherCAT®, as well as
OPC UA®-based communication and other protocols, which are often based
on Fast Ethernet.

With the introduction of \"Connected Industries\" or \"Industrial IoT\"
scenarios, the amount of networking between controls is assumed to rise.
Especially the number of controls participating and the amount of data
being exchanged is assumed to rise significantly. In this respect,
wireless communication using a 5G system may pave the way for highly
modular and flexible production modules that efficiently and flexibly
interact with each other.

In the following, the main focus is on control-to-control communication
between different motion (control) subsystems, as outlined in Clause
5.3.2. An exemplary application for that are large printing machines,
where it is not possible or desired to control all actuators and sensors
by one motion controller only. Such C2C systems typically have the most
demanding requirements on the underlying connectivity infrastructure.
For other C2C applications, the corresponding requirements (e.g., in
terms of clock synchronicity) become often more relaxed.

In general, this use case has very stringent requirements in terms of
latency and service availability. The required service area is usually
bigger than for \"motion control\" (see Clause 5.3.2), and interaction
with the public network (e.g., service continuity, roaming) is not
required.

#### 5.3.5.2 Preconditions

At least a subset of the controls are switched on and connected to the
5G network. The remaining controls may be interconnected with the other
controls using state-of-the-art wire-bound communication technologies,
such as the ones mentioned above.

#### 5.3.5.3 Service flows

Data transmission in control-to-control networks typically consists of
cyclic and non-cyclic data transfers. Both types may have real-time
requirements. However, the real-time requirements typically are lower
than in the case of communication between controls and sensors or
actuators (for example in case of motion control applications). Typical
cycle times for C2C communication are in the order of 4 to 10 ms.
However, the amounts of cyclic data typically are higher compared to the
communication between controls and sensors / actuators and may be more
than 1 kB per cycle.

Many C2C networks make heavy use of hot-plug features, so that
additional control nodes may be added to a running network as well as
being removed without affecting the data transfer between other nodes.

#### 5.3.5.4 Post-conditions

The different types of data transfers between the controls function as
required. The different controls act in a coordinated and tightly
coupled manner.

#### 5.3.5.5 Challenges to the 5G system

> Special challenges to the 5G system associated with this use case
> include the following aspects:
>
> Stringent requirements on end-to-end latency, communication service
> availability, and determinism.
>
> Very stringent requirements on synchronicity between different nodes.
>
> Transmission of possibly large amounts of data per cyclic data
> transmission.
>
> Potentially high density of UEs in the future

### 5.3.6 Mobile control panels with safety functions

#### 5.3.6*.*1 Description

Control panels are crucial devices for the interaction between people
and production machinery as well as for the interaction with moving
devices. These panels are mainly used for configuring, monitoring,
debugging, controlling and maintaining machines, robots, cranes or
complete production lines. In addition to that, (safety) control panels
are typically equipped with an emergency stop button and an enabling
device, which an operator can use in case of a safety event in order to
avoid damage to humans or machinery. When the emergency stop button is
pushed, the controlled equipment immediately has to come to a safe
stationary position. Likewise, if a machine, robot, etc. is operated in
the so-called special 'enabling device mode', the operator has to
manually keep the enabling device switch in a special stationary
position. If the operator pushes this switch too much or releases it,
the controlled equipment immediately has to come to a safe stationary
position as well. This way, it can be ensured that the hand(s) of the
operator are on the panel (and not under a moulding press, for example)
and that the operator does―for instance―not suffer from any electric
shock or the like. A common use case for this 'enabling device mode' is
the installation, testing or maintenance of a machine, during which
other safety mechanisms (such as a safety fence) have to be deactivated.

Due to the criticality of these safety functions, safety control panels
currently have mostly a wire-bound connection to the equipment they
control. In consequence, there tend to be many such panels for the many
machines and production units that typically can be found in a factory.
With an ultra-reliable low-latency wireless link, it would be possible
to connect such mobile control panels with safety functions wirelessly.
This would lead to a higher usability and would allow for the flexible
and easy re-use of panels for controlling different machines.

One way to realise the safety functions is to make use of a special
safety protocol in conjunction with the \"black channel\" principle
\[31\]. These safety protocols can ensure a certain safety level as
specified in \[32\] with no or only minor requirements on the
communication channel between the mobile control panel and the
controlled equipment. To this end, a strictly cyclic data communication
service is required between both ends. If the connectivity is
interrupted, an emergency stop is triggered, even if no real safety
event has occurred. That means the mobile control panel and the safety
controller (e.g., a safety programmable logic controller \[PLC\]) it is
attached to cyclically exchange messages and the machine stops if either
the connection is lost or if the exchanged messages explicitly indicate
that a safety event has been triggered (e.g., that the emergency stop
button has been pushed). Thus, guaranteeing the required safety level is
not difficult, but achieving at the same time a high availability of the
controlled equipment/production machinery is. To that end, an
ultra-reliable ultra-low-latency link is required.

The cycle times for the safety traffic always depend on the
process/machinery/equipment whose safety has to be ensured. For a
fast-moving robot, for example, the cycle times are lower than for a
slowly moving linear actuator.

Some of positioning related service requirements for this use case can
be found in \[66\].

In general, this use case has very stringent requirements in terms of
latency and service availability. The required service area is usually
bigger than for \"motion control\" (see Clause 5.3.2), and interaction
with the public network (e.g., service continuity, roaming) is not
required.

#### 5.3.6.2 Preconditions

The mobile control panel with safety functions is connected to a safety
PLC of the machine/equipment it is supposed to control. The mobile
control panel is in a predefined geographical position related to the
controlled device (defined area, free field of view). A cyclic data
communication service matching the cycle time requirements of the used
safety protocol has successfully been set up. The emergency stop button
is not pushed. The panel is not operated in enabling device mode, i.e.,
the operator does not have to keep the enabling device switch in a
dedicated stationary position for proper operation of the controlled
equipment.

#### 5.3.6.3 Service flows

A typical service flow may look as follows:

> 1\) The mobile control panel and safety PLC periodically exchange
> safety messages in intervals of *T*~cycle~ with a payload size of 40
> bytes to 250 bytes, indicating absence of any safety event. The value
> of the cycle time *T*~cycle~ depends on the controlled equipment and
> some examples can be found in the requirements given below.
>
> 2\) In parallel, a non-cyclic bi-directional data communication
> service with a data rate of at least 5 Mbit/s in each direction is set
> up between the mobile control panel and the safety PLC for
> facilitating human interaction with the machine for configuring,
> monitoring, maintaining, etc. the machine.
>
> 3\) Various bursts of non-cyclic data traffic are exchanged between
> the mobile control panel and the safety PLC in parallel to the cyclic
> data communication service for the safety traffic.
>
> 4\) The operator pushes the emergency stop button on the control
> panel, triggering the transmission of corresponding safety messages to
> the safety PLC.
>
> 5\) The controlled machine stops within a pre-defined time.

An alternative service flow covering the case of a broken link (which
should be avoided) may look as follows:

> 1\) The mobile control panel and safety PLC periodically exchange
> safety messages in intervals of *T*~cycle~ with a payload size of 40
> bytes to 250 bytes, indicating absence of any safety event. The value
> of the cycle time *T*~cycle~ depends on the controlled equipment and
> some examples can be found in the requirements given below.
>
> 2\) In parallel, a non-cyclic bi-directional data communication
> service with a data rate of at least 5 Mbit/s in each direction is set
> up between the mobile control panel and the safety PLC for
> facilitating human interaction with the machine for configuring,
> monitoring, maintaining, etc. the machine.
>
> 3\) Various bursts of non-cyclic messages are exchanged between the
> mobile control panel and the safety PLC in parallel to the enduring
> cyclic data communication service for the safety traffic.
>
> 4\) The cyclic data communication service between the mobile control
> panel and the safety PLC is interrupted or disturbed (in the sense
> that the cycle times requirement cannot be met anymore, for example),
> triggering a timeout at the safety PLC.
>
> 5\) The controlled machine stops within a pre-defined time.

All messages exchanged have to be properly secured (especially data
integrity and authenticity) and the probability of two consecutive
packet errors shall be negligible. This is because a single packet error
may be tolerable, but two consecutive packet errors may lead to a false
safety alarm and thus may lead to a lengthy production downtime.

#### 5.3.6.4 Post-conditions

Machines can be controlled in a safe way while meeting the requirements.
The controlled machine has stopped within a pre-defined time after the
emergency button has been pushed or the communication link was
disturbed. Nobody got hurt.

#### 5.3.6.5 Challenges to the 5G system

>
> \- Stringent requirements on end-to-end latency and jitter along with

### 5.3.7 Mobile robots

#### 5.3.7*.*1 Description

Mobile robots and mobile platforms, such as automated guided vehicles
(AGV), have numerous applications in industrial and intra-logistics
environments and will play an increasingly important role in the Factory
of the Future. A mobile robot essentially is a programmable machine able
to execute multiple operations, following programmed paths to fulfil a
large variety of tasks. This means, a mobile robot is able to perform
activities like assistance in work steps and transport of goods,
materials and other objects and can have a large mobility within the
industrial environment. Mobile robot systems are characterised by a
maximum flexibility in mobility relative to the environment, with a
certain level of autonomy and perception ability, i.e., they can sense
and react with their environment. AGVs are a sub-group of mobile robots.
AGVs are automatically steered and are driverless vehicles used to move
materials efficiently in a restricted facility. Mobile robots and AGVs
are monitored and controlled from a guidance control system. Radio
controlled guidance control is necessary to get an up-to-date process
information to avoid collisions between mobile robots, to assign driving
jobs to the mobile robots and manage the traffic of mobile robots. The
mobile robots are track-guided by the infrastructure with markers or
wires in the floor or guided by own surround sensors, like cameras or
laser scanners, for instance.

Mobile robot systems are sophisticated machines that represent a
complete material handling solution and which are installed in numerous
industries with a wide range of applications and environments. A
detailed overview of the state of the art of AGV systems with modern
areas of applications, AGV categories and AGV technologies is given in
\[41\].

The key aspects of mobile robots and AGV systems include:

> \- processes for handling goods and materials, especially incoming and
> outgoing goods, in warehousing and commissioning, in transportation as
> well as transfer and provision of goods;
>
> \- followed by information flows, namely the communication of
> inventory and movement reports, the outstanding order situation,
> throughput times and availability forecasts, presenting data to
> support tracking, monitoring and if needed to make decisions on
> measures to be taken, as well as the selection and implementation of
> means of data transfer;
>
> \- the use of means of transportation (cranes, lifters, conveyors,
> industrial trucks, etc.), as well as monitoring and control elements
> (sensory and actuating equipment);
>
> \- and finally the use of techniques (for active/passive security,
> data management, goods and wares recognition/identification, image
> processing, goods transfer, namely provision, sorting commissioning,
> palletising, packaging).

Mobile robot systems can be divided in operation in indoor, outdoor and
both indoor and outdoor areas. These environmental conditions have an
impact on the requirements of the communication system, e.g., the
handover process, to guarantee the required cycle times. Some examples
are given in Table 5.3.7.1-1.

+----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+

Depending on the operation area, this use case may have different
requirements:

\- in a limited service area (likely indoor), ultra-low latency is
required and not interaction with the public network (e.g., service
continuity, roaming);

\- in a wide service area (several kilometers, likely outdoors), the
latency requirement is relatively relaxed and interaction with the
public network (e.g., service continuity, roaming) may be required.

#### 5.3.7.2 Preconditions

All mobile robots and the guidance control system are switched on and
connected to the 5G network. The communication between the guidance
control system and mobile robots has been successfully set up and is
running.

#### 5.3.7.3 Service flows

***In the following, we distinguish three different cases, depending on
who is communicating with whom:***

> a\) Communication between mobile robot and guidance control system
>
> A number of mobile robots (up to 100, with a potential enrolment of up
> to 1000) are commonly in use, always guided by a guidance control
> system. The mostly centralised guidance control system communicates
> bidirectional with each mobile robot. In this respect, the following
> data is typically exchanged:
>
> \- Communication direction from guidance control system to mobile
> robot:
>
> \- Process data for control and management of mobile robots
>
> \- Emergency stop
>
> \- Communication direction from mobile robot to guidance control
> system:
>
> \- Process data (control and management data)
>
> \- Video or image data
>
> b\) Communication between mobile robots
>
> The mobile robots can exchange real-time control data with each other
> and provide a collision-free operation of autonomous mobile robots and
> synchronised actions between multiple mobile robots. For this purpose,
> the mobile robots exchange real-time control data.
>
> c\) Communication between mobile robots and peripheral facilities
>
> The mobile robots communicate with the peripheral facilities. For
> example, mobile robots are able to open and close doors or gates. For
> this purpose, the mobile robots transmit the control data to the door
> or gate control. Furthermore, mobile robots can be working together
> with fixed installations like cranes or manufacturing machines. To
> this end, the mobile robots exchange real-time control data with
> cranes or manufacturing machines.

#### 5.3.7.4 Post-conditions

Mobile robots and AGVs can be controlled in a safe way while satisfying
the requirements.

#### 5.3.7.5 Challenges to the 5G system

> Special challenges to the 5G system associated with this use case
> include the following aspects:
>
> Very stringent requirements on latency, communication service
> availability, and determinism.
>
> Very stringent requirements on clock synchronicity between different
> mobile robots.
>
> Simultaneous transmission of non-real time data, real-time streaming
> data (video) and highly-critical, real-time control data with highest
> requirements in terms of latency and communication service
> availability over the same link and to the same mobile robot.
>
> Potentially high density of mobile robots
>
> Good 5G coverage in indoor (from basement to roof), outdoor
> (plant/factory wide) and indoor/ outdoor environment is needed due to
> mobility of the robots.
>
> Seamless mobility support such that there is no impairment of the
> application in case of movements of a mobile robot within a factory or
> plant.

### 5.3.8 Massive wireless sensor networks

#### 5.3.8*.*1 Description

Sensor networks aim at monitoring the state or behaviour of a particular
environment. In the context of the Factory of the Future, wireless
sensor networks (WSN) are targeting the monitoring of a process and the
corresponding parameters in an industrial environment. This environment
is typically monitored using various types of sensors such as
microphones, CO~2~ sensors, pressure sensors, humidity sensors, and
thermometers. In particular, these sensors usually form a distributed
monitoring system. The monitored data, from such a system, is used to
detect anomalies in the data, i.e., by leveraging machine learning (ML)
algorithms. These algorithms usually require a training phase before a
trained ML algorithm can later work on a subset of the available
measured data. However, the training as well as the analysis of the data
may be realised in a centralised or distributed manner.

The placement of the monitoring function can be dynamic and thus, may
vary over time to enable dynamic up- and down-scaling of computing
resources. In particular, the placement may also be constrained by the
available WSN hardware. Given rather simple sensing devices, the
functionality needs to be placed into a centralised computing
infrastructure such as a mobile data or data centre cloud. Opposed to
that, functionality may be placed inside the sensor network, i.e., the
sensing devices, with additional external computational resources. The
computation is referred to as fog computing, multi-access edge computing
(MEC), and cloud computing, see Figure 5.3.8.1-1, when sensor devices
and gateways, gateways and edge cloud, and edge cloud and data centre
resources are involved, respectively. A more local approach, e.g., fog
computing or multi-access edge computing, is preferred over a more
centralised approach in order to keep sensitive data in a fabrication
site and keep the automated process independent of an internet
connection.

Sensor networks facilitate the complex task of monitoring an industrial
environment to detect malfunctioning and broken elements in the
surrounding environment. An appropriate detection approach along with a
classification of the anomaly can help choosing a countermeasure or
proper action to take in case of predictive maintenance. Such actions
can aid in improving the safety by automatically triggering a machine's
emergency stop in case of the detection of a critical problem. At the
same time, production efficiency can be increased as machines can
continue running in case the detected problem is not safety relevant and
only disrupts service of some elements.

Measuring the environment and propagating events may be realised in
different scenarios. In the simplest scenario, which is the least
scalable, the sensors propagate each newly measured value without any
pre-processing, i.e., in a solely proactive scenario. A more advanced
approach is to solely react to the environmental changes to reduce
traffic, e.g., by only propagating events under certain circumstances
whenever a value exceeds a certain threshold \[33\]. In such a case,
each sensor keeps measuring data but only propagates it whenever it
detects a relevant change in the environment. Depending on the hardware,
the sensing device may also be able to pause any active handling (i.e.,
polling data from sensor) as long as the given threshold is not
exceeded, e.g., by receiving an interrupt when the sensor itself
measures a sudden significant change of the environment. Usually, active
handling in such a case is triggered by a call back from the sensor or a
(remote) control unit. This optimisation enhances the sensing devices
durability by reducing its power consumption. The power consumption
reduction is an important task in WSNs since sensors are often just
equipped with a battery. Thus, the power consumption reduction has
gained a significant momentum in the WSN research. Moreover, a lot of
effort is put on specifying new messaging protocols to reduce overhead
of messaging protocols while still maintaining a high reliability and
low latency \[34\]. Additionally, the reduction of message generation,
e.g., by analysing measurements in local groups has thoroughly been
investigated.

The traffic patterns generated by the sensor network vary with the type
of measurement and the aforementioned setup. Traffic patterns may arise
in the form of self-similar and/or periodic patterns, i.e., the latter
is usually the case in proactive setups. Moreover, low-bandwidth and
high-bandwidth streams might be transmitted. Depending on the
computational resources of the gateway(s), some pre-processing of the
sensor data may reduce the network load, and with that, the uplink
requirements.

Figure 5.3.8.1-2: Sensor devices in star topology are connected to a
local gateway (i.e., small cell), which provides connectivity to a base
station

Figure 5.3.8.1-2 depicts a massive sensor network deployment. A number
of sensor devices are connected to a local gateway (small cell) which
connects to a base station at the edge to the cloud network. Hence, the
local gateway aggregates and forwards monitoring data. Also, while
aggregating, the local gateway may pre-process the incoming data to
reduce traffic load to the cloud and computational resource requirements
on the cloud. A local gateway needs to dynamically handle the attachment
requests and detachment events of sensor devices without disruption of
the monitoring service.

Figure 5.3.8.1-3: Sensor devices in a mesh topology realising multi-hop
connectivity to gateway (via edge devices)

Another topology for a massive sensor network is shown in Figure
5.3.8.1-3. Here, a set of sensor nodes is directly interconnected as a
mesh, where one sensor nodes provides an uplink to the serving gateway
(small cell). This reduces the number of locally deployed cells. In such
a topology the sensor nodes may communicate just locally to reduce the
load on more central instances such as gateways and cloud resources.

In both topologies, star and mesh, a sensor node needs to perform a
proper bootstrapping to connect to the network. It needs to be able to
attach itself to the network automatically by attaching itself to a
local cell or neighbouring mesh devices. Additionally, time
synchronisation of sensor nodes, base stations, and gateways can enhance
and ease monitoring. Time synchronisation in a massive sensor network
may be realised in local groups, using the gateways or base stations.
However, the bootstrapping of sensor nodes and the time synchronisation
is out of the scope of this document.

Table 5.3.8.1-1 provides an overview of typical service requirements in
condition monitoring. Condition monitoring for safety, i.e., monitoring
which may result in an emergency stop, requires reduced delay and
increased reliability to properly react in time. Thus, such a service
might be operated as dedicated network.

Table 5.3.8.1-2 exemplifies salient properties of commercial
off-the-shelf sensor nodes and the expected amount of data from a sensor
device. The amount and type of traffic engendered by this generated data
strongly depends on further processing of this data, e.g., compression
of raw audio or local analysis, as well as on the implemented messaging
protocol. The protocol overhead increases the amount of data due to
additional headers, redundancy, and/or acknowledgement and
retransmission mechanisms \[34\].

As provided in Table 5.3.8.1-2, an example for low traffic monitoring is
thermal monitoring. Thermostats usually slowly adapt to temperature
changes. Thus, a fairly low sampling rate is sufficient and a threshold
based propagation mechanism can be used. Accordingly, the thermal
monitoring may generate \"bursty\" traffic patterns with small data
packets, since the measured data is typically a single integer or set of
integers for a specific time frame. The audio sampling rate strongly
depends on the application. For instance, a sampling rate of 50 Hz is
only able to record a maximum frequency of up to 25 Hz, which is the
lower bound of human hearing. For machine applications, sampling rates
of 192 kHz with frequencies up to 96 kHz may be recorded, which can be
easily beyond the human hearing range.

Audio monitoring is a typical application for a sensor network with high
traffic demands. Audio sensors produce a continuous data stream per
device of tens of kilobits per second, depending on the audio encoding
and targeted frequency range. Some sensor nodes may not have the
computational resources to pre-process the audio stream. This, however,
would eliminate the possibility to realise a threshold based propagation
mechanism. A typical monitoring system needs be scalable up to hundreds
or thousands of sensor nodes with up to 100 wireless sensor nodes per
gateway \[38\].

This use case has relatively moderate latency requirements. The required
service area is usually bigger than for \"motion control\" (see Clause
5.3.2). Interaction with the public network (e.g., service continuity,
roaming) may be required.

#### 5.3.8.2 Preconditions

> \- Wireless devices are attached to local gateways
>
> \- Local gateways are connected to Cloud/MEC (via base station/wired)

#### 5.3.8.3 Service flows

> 1\. Sensing devices continuously send current sensor status to
> centralised computing instance for learning of the environment
>
> 2\. After completion of learning, devices send
>
> \- less data to centralised instance. A reduced data set is either
> pre-processed data or raw data which sent less frequently;
>
> \- data to neighbouring sensor devices or local gateway for group/mesh
> processing of environmental state. Further processing may also be
> realised on MEC/Cloud.
>
> 3\. An anomaly in the measurements, e.g., a rapidly rising temperature
> or an unusual scraping sound, is detected on either of
>
> \- Fog;
>
> \- MEC;
>
> \- Cloud.
>
> 4\. Detected event is propagated to factory's controlling instance.
>
> 5\. Action is taken by controlling instance.

#### 5.3.8.4 Post-conditions

The proper action was executed that is optimum for safety and
productivity (no operation/ machine stop/ warning) for given anomaly.

#### 5.3.8.5 Challenges to the 5G system

Special challenges to the 5G system associated with this use case
include the following aspects:

> \- large number of UEs per radio cell;
>
> \- high aggregate user experienced data rate;
>
> \- local groups need to be formed; mesh topologies need to be
> realised;
>
> \- low-latency requirements combined with high reliability;
>
> \- automated attachment of UEs without services disruption for
> connected UEs;
>
> \- interfaces to allow programmability of gateways;
>
> \- packet prioritisation techniques to meet constraints for critical
> messages.

### 5.3.9 Remote access and maintenance

#### 5.3.9*.*1 Description

Remote Access and Maintenance is a key motivation for looking beyond
conventionally wired device networks in automation. Typical industrial
networks are isolated from the internet and often based on very specific
protocols. In such industrial networks (peer-to-peer communication links
between just two devices, fieldbus with multiple devices and
controllers, LAN or WLANs), a remote access is often possible already
today, but requires gateway functionality at any transition of the
automation pyramid between bus systems, as shown in Figure 5.3.9.1-1.
Mapping of data formats, addresses, coding, units, and status is
required for a remote access to device data going down the automation
pyramid, which comes along with a huge engineering effort. This data
mapping implemented in the gateway(s) is quite static and is not
suitable for a flexible access on event-based conditions rather than a
permanent connection and data exchange, e.g., reading the device
revision in case of a diagnostic event.

through controllers\
via gateways at each transition point of the automation pyramid

Remote Access and Maintenance scenarios apply to devices which

> \- already have a \"cyclic\" connection through a communication
> service for transmitting data regularly. This ad-hoc communication
> might be requested by the same end device and just runs in parallel
> from time to time;
>
> \- act almost autonomously, i.e., they have local computing power to
> run algorithms like measurement and data analytics, but they do not
> have a regular, cyclic connected communication service;
>
> \- have local personnel to interact with, such as a machine or even a
> car. A remote connection could be requested during a service case or
> if the local operator needs remote assistance;
>
> \- sleep most of the time and which should be woken up by establishing
> a connection via a dedicated wireless network.

A special sub-set of remote accesses is when the partner is a mobile
device (geographically) near the device instead of a service far away
from the device. The device might not differentiate if it is accessed
remotely or \"locally\" via the 5G network. Use cases described here
would be the same from the device's point of view. A remote user would
expect to parse a list with devices and have them organised in trees. A
local operator has the intention to \"talk with the device in front of
her/him\" instead of walking through a list of 10 000 devices installed
at this plant. There should be means to automatically discover which 5G
devices belonging to a certain group (e.g., all 5G devices installed in
a process plant) are in the immediate vicinity of a local operator and
to provide the user with a list of all those 5G devices.

Another use case is the inventory of devices and periodic readouts of
configuration data, event logs, revision data, and predictive
maintenance information. This is often called \"asset management\", and
tools for collecting and displaying data from many connected devices are
called \"asset monitors\". Such a system may work autonomously (set of
configured periodical checks) or it is interacting with a user (\"show
me status of this device\"). A remote diagnostic system might be
connected to many or all devices of a certain plant or location. A
remote diagnostic system might be connected to many or all devices the
operator is responsible for. A remote diagnostic system could also run
as a device vendor's service to maintain all devices independent of the
device owner (plant, location).

There exist many protocols for reading and writing data to smart
devices. Some of these protocols are standardised and many others
proprietary. Assuming an IP-capability of a 5G system, it should be
possible to either use

> \- standardised IP-based protocols (such as OPC UA®, ModbusTCP®,
> HARTip®);
>
> \- pack non-IP-based protocols into IP-frames in a proprietary way.
> This can be inside standardised protocols such as http (port 80) or
> proprietary IP-based protocols (device specific ports);
>
> \- proprietary IP-based protocols (device specific ports).

Communicated data could be of any kind from single bytes, longer
telegrams of a few kilobytes to continuous streams. Volume applications
are expected with power and memory limited devices. The full range from
power-optimised applications on the one end to high performance
real-time data on the other end should be covered.

Remote access to a device may happen at any time (in case the user does
authorise). So the remote access shall be non-reactive to other
communication in the 5G network and operation and performance to other
devices. Remote access should have impact only on the contacted device.
Prioritised traffic mechanisms may solve the problem to not violate
configured real time conditions when upgrading a firmware of a device in
the same network.

The trigger to remotely access a device may come from the device itself,
based on a certain event or condition. In this case, a device initiates
a connection to another (known) device and submits data which alerts a
service to read / write specific data from / to that device.

A major concern associated with remote access and maintenance is the
potential vulnerability of devices in terms of cyber security. Most
classical wired communication protocols in industry do not consider any
cyber security relevant scenarios. Physical access to devices and
networks is almost restricted to skilled and authorised personnel.
Furthermore, protocols are not widely used outside these specific
industries and so the knowledge is kept to a limited community of
specialists.

Users might want to block a device for any remote access, others might
restrict access to only read data or just parts of data, such as
operating hour meter, but no configuration data. Some restriction levels
might be specific to the device and as such not standardised. Those
restrictions should be fully transparent to the lower communication
layers (5G in this case). A basic set of restriction levels are expected
from 5G, what could be an adoption of existing mobile communication
standards,

Electronic industrial devices do have a typical life cycle between 5 and
25 years. Customers expect old devices to remain accessible during this
time with (at least) the same functionality that was provided when they
were installed. Installations in process industry and factory automation
are continuously extended and changed, so new devices are operated in
parallel to old ones.

The operation for this use case can be in a wide service area, and
interaction with the public network (e.g., service continuity, roaming)
may be required.

#### 5.3.9.2 Preconditions

> \- Device is connected to the 5G network;
>
> \- service tool (asset management system or asset monitor) is
> connected to the 5G network via a gateway

#### 5.3.9.3 Service flows

An example service flow may look as follows:

> 1\) device detects a condition that \"call for maintenance\" is
> required and sends a message to a predefined address, i.e., that of
> the asset management tool OR an asset management tool opens a
> connection to the device;
>
> 2\) the tool checks device type and identity (starting with 5G
> information elements, going further down to device, customer, location
> specific information);
>
> 3\) the tool reads / writes data from / to the device. This could be a
> few bytes, new firmware, or read real-time monitoring data. This is
> done for a limited time; and
>
> 4\) the tool closes the connection to the device.

#### 5.3.9.4 Post-conditions

The maintenance case has been successfully completed.

#### 5.3.9.5 Challenges to the 5G system

Special challenges to the 5G system associated with this use case
include the following aspects:

> \- \"Un-configured\", sporadic network load, i.e., remote access
> injects traffic at a time not known during network setup.
>
> \- Sporadic network traffic with a particular device must not disturb
> configured and already running communication
>
> \- Low power operation of devices, i.e., long time periods without any
> communication but always ready to receive a request (or to open a

### 5.3.10 Augmented reality

#### 5.3.10*.*1 Description

It is envisioned that in future smart factories and production
facilities, people will continue to play an important and substantial
role. However, due to the envisaged high flexibility and versatility of
the Factories of the Future, shop floor workers should be optimally
supported in getting quickly prepared for new tasks and activities and
in ensuring smooth operations in an efficient and ergonomic manner. To
this end, augmented reality (AR) may play a crucial role, for example
for the following applications:

> Monitoring of processes and production flows
>
> Step-by-step instructions for specific tasks, for example in manual
> assembly workplaces
>
> Ad-hoc support from a remote expert, for example for maintenance or
> service tasks

In this respect, especially head-mounted AR devices with see-through
display are very attractive since they allow for a maximum degree of
ergonomics, flexibility and mobility and leave the hands of workers free
for other tasks. However, if such AR devices are worn for a longer
period of time (e.g., one work shift), these devices have to be
lightweight and highly energy-efficient while at the same time they
should not become very warm. A very promising approach is to offload
complex (e.g., video) processing tasks to the network (e.g., an edge
cloud) and to reduce the AR head-mounted device's functionality. This
has the additional benefit that the AR application may have easy access
to different context information (e.g., information about the
environment, production machinery, the current link state, etc.) if
executed in the network. A possible processing chain for such a setup is
depicted in Figure 5.3.10.1-1.

![](media/image28.png){width="6.143055555555556in" height="2.25in"}

Figure 5.3.10.1-1: Possible processing chain for an augmented reality\
system with offloaded tracking and rendering

Here, the AR tracking algorithm determines the current viewpoint of the
AR device and places the desired augmentations at the right positions in
the current image. One of the main challenges with such a setup is that
the displayed augmentations have to timely follow any movements of the
camera in the AR device (which may be caused by any movements of the
person wearing the AR device) since otherwise the AR user may get sick
after some time and a reasonable usage would not be possible. Therefore,
also a compression of the video stream from the AR device to the image
processing server and back should be avoided if possible in order to
reduce the overall processing latency and requirements.

Some of positioning related service requirements for this use case can
be found in \[66\] \[67\].

This use case has very stringent requirements in terms of latency and
service availability. The required service area is usually bigger than
for \"motion control\" (see Clause 5.3.2). Interaction with the public
network (e.g., service continuity, roaming) is not required.

#### 5.3.10.2 Preconditions

A user is wearing a head-mounted AR device, which is connected to an
image processing server in a (local) edge cloud via a 5G system. Some
augmentations have already been registered in the field of view of the
user and shall be tracked and rendered by the image processing server.

#### 5.3.10.3 Service flows

A possible service flow is as follows:

> 1\. A camera integrated into the AR device permanently takes new
> images, with a frame rate ≥ 60 Hz and at least HD (1280 x 720) or Full
> HD (1920 x 1080) resolution;
>
> 2\. The AR device continuously transmits all images via the 5G system
> to the image processing server, which may run in a (local) edge cloud,
> for example;
>
> 3\. The image processing server determines the current field of view
> of the camera integrated into the AR device based on the received
> image(s);
>
> 4\. The image processing server determines the optimal placements of
> the previously registered augmentations in the current image based on
> the updated viewpoint and potentially places additional augmentations
> in the current image;
>
> 5\. The image processing server renders the augmented image and sends
> it back to the AR device via the 5G system;
>
> 6\. The AR device displays the augmented image.

#### 5.3.10.4 Post-conditions

The augmentations in the view field of the user smoothly follow any
movements of the AR device in an appropriate way, offering an excellent
user experience and preventing the user to get sick after some time.

#### 5.3.10.5 Challenges to the 5G system

Special challenges to the 5G system associated with this use case
include the following aspects:

> \- very high data rate requirements along with low latency
> requirements.
>
> \- the need for seamless mobility support.

To keep a plant running, it is essential that the assets, such as pumps,
valves, heaters, instruments, etc., are maintained. Timely recognition
of any degradation and continuous self-diagnosis of components are used
to support and plan maintenance. Remote software updates enhance and
adapt the components to changing conditions and advances in technology.

The positioning requirements for this use case are mianly based on the
typical scenarios where IoT devices (e.g., sensors) are giving insight
into process or environmental conditions or inventory of material, asset
management or maintenance.

The operation for this use case can be in a wide service area, and
interaction with the public network (e.g., service continuity, roaming)
may be required.

#### 5.3.13.2 Preconditions

Smart assets including self-diagnosis and sensors providing relevant
data for asset condition are distributed over the plant. All nodes are
connected to the 5G system.

#### 5.3.13.3 Service flows

Data from smart assets and sensors are transmitted to storage within a
defined time interval. In the case of an actual failure, an event is
transmitted immediately.

In the case of a software update of smart devices, block data are
transferred to the devices. Multiple devices may be updated at the same
time.

#### 5.3.13.4 Post-conditions

Data and event information are available where needed for processing and
displaying. Assets are maintained in an optimal manner.

#### 5.3.13.5 Challenges to the 5G system

Special challenges to the 5G system associated with this use case
include the following aspects:

> \- potentially harsh propagation environments with many metallic parts
> (pipes, tanks, supports);
>
> \- potentially high density of UEs;
>
> \- potentially large communication distance over multiple kilometres;
>
> \- high energy-efficiency required in case of battery-driven sensors.

### 5.3.14 Connectivity for the factory floor

#### 5.3.14.1 Description

A factory floor has adopted 5G networks for wireless automation, where a
variety of sensors, devices, machines, robots, actuators, and terminals
are communicating to coordinate and share data. Some of these devices
may be directly connected to a local type-b network and some may be
connected via gateway(s).

An example of the deployment scenario is in Figure 5.3.14.1-1.

Figure 5.3.14.1-1: Factory of the future using a dedicated local type-b
network for industrial automation

#### 5.3.14.2 Pre-conditions

An industrial factory has been provisioned with a dedicated RAN based on
local dedicated cells and a local dedicated core network.

Factory floor equipment like sensors, controllers, operator terminals,
and actuators have been provisioned with 5G connectivity modules. These
modules have subscription information to access the local network.

Operators, technicians, and engineers have 5G enabled devices. These
devices have subscription information to access the local network. These
devices may also have subscription information for other networks.

#### 5.3.14.3 Service flows

Factory equipment and human operators and technicians have sufficient
connectivity and credentials to connect to the local network,
authenticating with the local core network. Typical closed-loop control
applications run over this network with extremely low latency and high
reliability. Due to the dedicated nature of the network there is also
high availability and consistency of latency and throughput.

In the case of a device which does not have subscription information for
the network, the local core network will reject the attempt resulting in
the local RAN refusing access to the device.

Technicians can access the network on site and ensure high availability
due to pre-emptive maintenance for the local network. Network
optimisation can also be performed with a higher level of aptitude due
to tighter integration with the process control. In the case of
catastrophic failure, technicians can repair the network on-site.

Devices can be on-boarded directly by the factory owner.

#### 5.3.14.4 Post-conditions

Typical closed-loop control applications operate with consistent and
appropriate performance.

#### 5.3.14.5 Challenges to the 5G system

> \- Integration and connectivity with factory LANs, in particular
> real-time Ethernet.
>
> \- Support of local non-public deployment with KPIs that meet specific
> industrial requirements.
>
> \- Providing isolation between machines involved in specific
> production processes and other parts of a factory network. For
> example, in Figure 5.3.14.1-1, there could be some firewall functions
> in the dedicated local core to allow for isolation.

### 5.3.15 Inbound logistics for manufacturing

#### 5.3.15.1 Description

In this example, a supply-chain company moves products between multiple
different independent manufacturing, distribution, and retail centres.
The container traverses the networks of various port operators, liner
ships, trucking companies, and warehouses. The heavy good vehicles
(HGVs) operated by the supply-chain company are wirelessly connected to
the PLMN to enable real time tracking and telematics. In these cases,
the use case often changes when the actor is in range of one or another
network. What these use cases have in common is that the actor needs to
be able to connect to the correct network at any given time to operate
correctly. The pallets carrying the materials for delivery have also
been connected via 5G UEs or IoT devices for tracking and inventory
control purposes.

Some of positioning related service requirements for this use case can
be found in \[68\].

This use case describes the scenario where a HGV arrives at the
receiving area of a factory and delivers a pallet of materials which is
subsequently incorporated into the local factory inventory management
system in an automated manner.

#### 5.3.15.2 Pre-conditions

A factory has been provisioned with a type-b local 5G network. A
supply-chain company which delivers palletised goods supplies this
factory (amongst others).

The distribution vehicle has subscription credentials for the public
macro network.

The pallet(s) for delivery to the factory have subscription credentials
for the public macro network and either (a) subscription credentials for
the factory local type-b networks or (b) facility to obtain and use
subscription credentials for the factory local type-b network.

The supply-chain company tracks the pallets and vehicles via MNO network
when in transit.

#### 5.3.15.3 Service Flows

PLMN as each item has a separate subscription. This connection is used
to report the HGVs location and telematics, and the location of the
pallets.

The HGV arrives at the industrial factory. The HGV remains connected to
the macro network but the pallet is expected to connect to the local
type-b network to track its arrival and integrate with the stock control
systems of the factory. The pallet detects the presence of the local
network of the destination factory, obtains the credentials to attach to
the network (if not already provisioned), and connects to the local
type-b network. For example, the home operator may remotely provision
the credentials via a secure mechanism, or the local type-b network may
provision the credentials via a secure mechanism.

No other pallets on the HGV (which are destined for different locations)
attempt to attach to the local type-b network.

The pallet identifies itself to the factory's stock control system and
is now tracked by the factory processes.

#### 5.3.15.4 Post-conditions

The HGV leaves the industrial premises whilst still connected to the
macro MNO network and the pallet remains, connected to the type-b
network of the factory.

#### 5.3.15.5 Challenges to the 5G system

##### 5.3.15.5.1 Identification of type-b networks and method of connection

As the use cases for local type-b networks are required to be scalable
for massive numbers of deployments, including by non-traditional MNO
actors, identification of the local type-b network need to avoid
bottleneck into PLMN ID allocation ( the PLMN IDs with limited number
space might quickly exhausted in those countries with high uptake of
local type-b networks).

In this scenario, when the 5G or IoT device attached to the pallet
detects the presence of a local type-b network, there are some options
on how the 5G UE or IoT device connects to the local type-b network.

> \- Dual subscription: the 5G device has independent subscriptions for
> public and type-b 5G networks.
>
> \- Dual registration: the 5G UE or IoT Device remains registered on
> and connected to the PLMN and establishes a second registration and
> connection to the local type-b network.
>
> \- Manual PLMN selection: where the 5G UE or IoT Device performs a
> manual PLMN selection procedure (although this process may be
> initiated by an automatic procedure outside of 3GPP scope). As a
> consequence, the network should have a human readable name to enable
> manual selection of the type-b network.

###  5.3.16 Wide-area connectivity for fleet maintenance

#### 5.3.16.1 Description

A scenario where this form of deployment scenario would be applicable is
in the automatic wide-area data collection and tuning of an automotive
fleet. In the following example, a Heavy Goods Vehicle (HGV)
manufacturer has an ongoing contract with a haulage company to
constantly track the performance of a fleet of vehicles and
automatically remap their Electronic Control Unit over-the-air to ensure
efficient performance based on haulage load. In this scenario, wide area
coverage is essential and the use case is highly latency tolerant.

An example of the deployment scenario is in Figure 5.3.16.1-1.

height="0.73125in"}![](media/image30.png){width="1.1006944444444444in"
height="0.73125in"}

#### 5.3.16.2 Pre-conditions

A HGV fleet manager has a contract for the HGV manufacturer to provide
ongoing engine control unit (ECU) updates to ensure optimal fuel
efficiency.

The HGV fleet has been provisioned with connectivity modules connected
to the ECU of their engines. These modules have a subscription to a
nationwide MNO for data connectivity.

#### 5.3.16.3 Service flows

The fleet of HGVs periodically upload telematics data via the
MNO-connected connectivity modules. This upload is very delay tolerant
(\>30 min). The data is routed via MNO network to the HGV manufacturer's
enterprise server for analytics and storage.

After analysis, a new ECU remapping is generated for an individual HGV
and is transmitted down to the vehicle for installation at a convenient
time (e.g., when the vehicle is parked). This installation may also be
scheduled to happen live with an OTA connection (again, at a convenient
time).

The vehicle continues periodic telematic upload throughout.

#### 5.3.16.4 Post-conditions

Data upload and download operates with use-case appropriate performance.

#### 5.3.16.5 Challenges to the 5G system

None.

#### 5.3.16.6 Potential requirements

None.

### 5.3.17 Variable message reliability

#### 5.3.17*.*1 Description

Many control systems operate synchronously based on a periodic control
cycle. Measurements (sent by the sensors) are usually periodic. This
allows the controller to request the actuators to perform small
adjustments in order to maintain the desired output response and a
stable system. A stable system will be operating within a desired output
response during a predefined time window.

The reliability of the transmissions has to be very high: the
measurements need to be received successfully and any commands sent to
the actuator must also be received successfully, all within tight
latency bounds.

There are some processes (or plants) that may already be in a stable
situation. As an example, a robotic arm which performs a repetitive task
(e.g., pick up a package), will require the arm to be positioned within
a target area A at a given time window T. As long as the arm is within
the target area A within window T, the system is considered stable. When
the system is stable, commands to adjust the position of the arm may not
be necessary. On the other hand, if the arm is outside the area at the
target time window, the controller will request the actuator to move the
arm toward the target area A, and such actions will have a high priority
or urgency, and therefore the command sent requires a higher reliability
from the network.

Therefore, the information regarding system state or the \"urgency\" of
the message, or the desired reliability of the message transmission, can
be used by the network to manage resources more efficiently by
scheduling resources for each of the transmissions. Similarly, if the
process or plant under control is stable, the data may not be as urgent,
and the network can give fewer resources to the sensor device to send
the measurements to the controller or to a command to keep the actuator
at the same position. That means that the desired reliability for the
message can vary dynamically, and if this information can be provided
from the controller to the network, the network can use that information
to optimise resource allocation.

The alternative to adjusting the reliability dynamically is provisioning
the system for the highest possible reliability required, which would
require more resources and therefore reduce the network efficiency.

#### 5.3.17.2 Preconditions

A robotic arm performs a repetitive task to pick up a package.

The system is considered stable if the robot's arm is positioned within
a target area A at a given time window T.

The control system operates synchronously, based on a periodic control
cycle.

#### 5.3.17.3 Service flows

The robot's sensors report measurements to the application function
(controller) in an application server outside the 3GPP domain.

The application function recognises that the system is stable and the
robot's arm is within the target area A within time window T.

The application function sends a command to the actuator in the next
cycle. As the system is stable the application function informs the 3GPP
network that the message reliability can be relaxed.

#### 5.3.17.4 Post-conditions

The message is sent with lower reliability.

#### 5.3.17.5 Challenges to the 5G system

New interface definition needed between 3GPP network and application
function.

### 5.3.18 Flexible, modular assembly area 

#### 5.3*.*18*.*1 Description

In the Factories of the Future, static sequential production systems
will increasingly be replaced by novel, modular production systems
offering high production flexibility and versatility. The concept of
modular production systems encompasses a large number of increasingly
mobile production assets, for which powerful wireless communication and
localisation services are required. An example quantity structure for
car manufacturing is provided in Annex E.

NOTE: The communication streams in this use case will usually have to
coexist with those of other applications, e.g., massive wireless sensor
networks (Clause 5.3.8) and remote access and maintenance (Clause
5.3.9).

#### 5.3*.*18*.*2 Preconditions

Life cycle chain status: a modular production environment adaptable to
the different variants of product orders is up and running. Modular
assembly stations can be added or moved inside the production area.

Communication infrastructure: a non-public, local network inside the
manufacturing hall is installed, and the deployment is adapted to the
flexible production layout. The local, type-b network or type-a network
is realised by a 5G system.

Mobile assets that are in a ready state, i.e., they are ready for
factory production. These mobile assets typically include

\- lift and lowering AGV (moveable assembly platforms);

\- convey and lift AGV;

\- mobile robots with video support for unstructured goods in stock;

\- root trains;

\- worker assistance support by aid of video up and download;

\- portable assembly tools (power screwdriver, riveting tools, staple
guns ...);

\- portal cranes.

#### 5.3*.*18*.*3 Service flows

Communication flows in the assembly area:

\- vertical: ERP to and from MES (order and resource management);

\- vertical flows to and from MES: centralised orchestration of assets,
material and quality status;

\- MES (decentralised production): in many cases, communication will be
initiated by the assembled part itself. In this document this kind of
assembled part is called MPSC (manufactured product as a smart client).
This MPSC is often moved by an AGV. Associated bi-directional
communication patterns are

\- MPSC -- MES;

\- MPSC -- asset, worker (e.g., request for processing);

\- asset -- MES (e.g., status);

\- asset -- asset (e.g., collaborating robots);

\- asset -- material (e.g., ID, localisation);

\- worker -- MES (e.g., request for assistance);

\- worker -- asset (e.g., request for localisation);

\- worker -- material (e.g., ID, localisation);

\- ERP, MES and MPSC communication:

\- status information exchange between the MPSC, MES and ERP;

\- MES or MPSC resource request for mobile assets, workers, and tools
(identification, localisation, status, commands);

\- material request based on order management: mobile robots, AGVs, and
root trains are instructed to bring parts and material to the assembly
station just in time. Sending of status information;

\- At an assembly station:

\- workers get the task of assembling parts according instructions with
real-time video assistance;

\- mobile robots get the task to assemble parts according to
instructions from the MES or MPSC. Particular collaboration with a
second robot or workers is requested;

\- information reporting: during and after the assembly process; status
and quality information---combined with position info---are contributed.

#### 5.3*.*18*.*4 Post-conditions

The planned assembly step is finalised MPSC is moved to the next process
step & assembly station by an AGV.

#### 5.3*.*18*.*5 Challenges to the 5G system

> \- Ultra-reliable wireless communication for a variety communication
> services adhering to negotiated and guaranteed QoS parameters.

\- Communication bursts when several parallel actions occur (e.g.,
parallel actions supported by real-time video assistance).

\- High density of mobile assets.

\- Changing the 5G network configuration in the production when the
layout of the assembly area is altered. The 5G network configuration
change is carried out by the production staff, supported by self
optimising algorithm. In some cases this only involves the UEs. In other
cases, base stations might have to be relocated or more base stations
might have to be added to the 5G network.

\- 5G network maintenance and communication service assurance:

\- monitoring the production environment and processes related to
communication; detect potential communication bottlenecks in the
production area;

\- the diagnosis of network error, faults, underperformance, etc.
contains recommendations for what to do for fulfilling the requested
QoS.

####  5. 3*.*18.6 Potential requirements

##### 5.3.18.6.1 Reconfiguration of the non-public 5G network for flexible production 

Changing the configuration should not compromise QoS guarantees of
operating communication services. But a change in the physical
production layout could imply changes in the communication
infrastructure. Example: dynamic size adaption of radio cells. This
requires adding geographic information in QoS communication service
requests.

##### 5.3.18.6.2 Maintaining and operating 5G communication in flexible production scenarios

Running a highly available and reliable type-b network or type-a network
for production environments requires different maintenance than for a
typical IT office network. Prohibitive capital damage can result from
the violation of the requested communication service quality. Therefore,
the maintenance of type-b networks or type-a networks in factories
requires knowledge of the production process. This is the reason for why
the type-b network or the type-a network in production is the
responsibility of the infrastructure operator (see Clause 6.2).
Management tools and rules to run and maintain a 5G network have to be
adapted to the different qualification and view of the staff in a
production environment. Furthermore, after damages with high economical
impact, analysis based on trusted, logged network monitoring information
is needed for identifying the failure origin and cause.

##### 5.3.18.6.3 Public networks in flexible production scenarios

The supply chain in the factory can include deliveries by external
companies that use automated HGVs or AGVs (see also Clause 5.3.15).
Also, intelligent tags can be attached to incoming and outcome goods and
these tags will require continuous services (e.g., localisation; clock;
communication for low-bit-rate, non-deterministic data upload). The
majority of all communication services will still run in the type-a
network, but some would be run in the PLMN. Here it is assumed that the
MNO operates both a PLMN and the type-a network in the factory. The
type-a network could be realised as a private slice of the PLMN network.

### 5.3.19 Plug and produce for field devices

#### 5.3.19*.*1 Description

This use case covers the realisation of plug-and-produce for intelligent
field devices that utilise 5G communication services. This use case is
based on the plug-and-produce use case described elsewhere in the
literature \[52\].

\"Plug and produce\" addresses the automated integration and
configuration of a (new) field device into an existing production
system. The plug-and-produce use case is applicable to discrete
manufacturing as well as continuous and batch processing. The goal of
plug and produce is to increase the flexibility and adaptability of
production systems and to speed up the commissioning process of field
devices by reducing manual overhead. The field device in question may be
an individual sensor or actuator, or a more complex production unit.

One of the main concerns when allowing this kind of dynamic integration
of field devices into a production system is to ensure that the
automation system is always complying with the automation system
security requirements. This requires controls to provide access to a
production system only to authenticated, authorised field devices. For
unconstrained field devices, the plug & produce integration of field
devices within a production system can be protected through appropriate
application layer security mechanisms. In those cases, 5G security and
security of the production system can be handled rather independently.
However, some field devices are constrained (for instance battery-driven
field devices), and some real-time automation applications might run in
an (edge) cloud environment that do not allow for application layer
security mechanisms. As "over the top security" (OTT) is not possible
here, the security of the production system has to rely on the security
of the 5G system. Thus, as a rule of thumb, factory operators strive to
offer security already at the network layer. Also, in many cases, the
factory operator also manages the communication network, and in that
role she is interested in securing the network itself. There is thus a
strong interest in securing wired and wireless communication in
factories. That is one of the reasons why factory operators have a
strong interest in type-b 5G network deployments so that factory
operators are in control on the security of the production system and
the underlying type-b 5G network.

A 3GPP-relevant feature of such field devices is that they often offer
more than one communication port (e.g., IEEE 802.11 WLAN and IEEE 802.3
Ethernet), and that some field devices may support only some
communication technologies (e.g., only 5G or only WLAN). So, the
(type-b) 5G communication system has to be integrated in a production
system using heterogeneous communication technologies. It is also
noteworthy that factory operators prefer a unified authentication of
field devices, i.e., that the same communication authentication
credential can be used with different communication technologies and
ports. After being connected and being discovered by the production
system, the field device automatically obtains the configuration
required to participate in the production process.

One of the main differences between industrial field devices and
consumer products is the longevity of the former. Typical life times of
field devices are one decade or longer. As many production systems are
subject to regulatory approvals (e.g., safety certification), changes to
a running production system have often to be avoided. This has
implication for mobile-network connectivity since the field device (UE)
will typically be integrated in a larger production system and cannot be
replaced simply.

Note that security for the field device application, i.e., the
automation function, can---in principle---be realised via OTT security
(as with 3G and 5G systems). However, so doing is not feasible for the
following special cases:

> \- battery-powered field devices;
>
> \- closed-loop control requiring low-latency communication (example:
> mobile control panel; see Clause 5.3.6);
>
> \- hosting of automation functions in 5G (edge) clouds.

The plug-and-produce use case is divided into 6 steps/scenarios,
starting from the physical connection of the field device until the
field device is fully integrated into the production process (see Figure
5.3.19.1-1).

Plug-and-produce may be realised using either wired or wireless
networking infrastructure. The present use case considers wireless
network connectivity using a type-b 5G network for plug and produce.

NOTE 1: The communication network and the application of the production
system need to be distinguished. On the one hand, there is the
communication network providing connectivity between the individual
network nodes (OSI network layers 1-3/4, steps 1 and 2 above). The
topology of this network is determined by the wiring of the
communication nodes and the wireless connectivity of the field devices.
This functionality is assumed to be provided by the wireless 5G network.
On the other hand, there is the automation application of the production
system (OSI application layers 5 to7, steps 3 to 6 above). The
communication needs of the automation application is determined by the
tasks to be performed by the production system, e.g., the collaborations
required between individual automation field devices in order to
complete a manufacturing step.

NOTE 2: The EAP framework is increasingly been used for authentication
in factory automation networks.

Classic automation systems are structured hierarchically. Exchange of
data between hierarchies or zones is only allowed between well-defined
groups of field devices (zones and conduits). A zone is a well-defined
(physical) substructure of the automation network containing devices
needed for a production step that sha­re the same security requirements
(e.g., confidentiality level). An example for a zone is a production
line. Data/information can only be exchanged between devices belonging
to different zones by the use of dedicated conduits. A conduit defines
which data is allowed to be exchanged between two zones. This approach
is an important building block for the security concept for industrial
control and automation systems. 5G needs to provide an equivalent way to
realise restricted data flow and implement (network) access control,
etc. for industrial control and automation systems.

#### 5.3.19.2 Preconditions

##### 5.3.19.2.1 The field device

The field device possesses a set of authentication credentials. The
authentication credentials were issued by either the plant operator or
the field device manufacturer. Different types of credentials are
possible, e.g.,

> X.509 credentials (e.g., for a certificate-based EAP-TLS
> Authentication);
>
> SIM/AKA.

The selection of credentials depends on the deployed factory automation
system, i.e., field devices that are added before or after commission of
the automation system need to use the same type of credentials. The
authentication credential chosen is recognised by the 5G network.

##### 5.3.19.2.2 The network

The factory communication networks have been set up. In the case of 5G,
a type-b 5G network has been set up. Only UEs with valid authentication
certificates according to Clause 5.3.19.2.1 are authorised to connect to
this type-b network. UEs with other types of credentials, i.e., for a
PLMN or another type-b 5G network, are barred from connecting to the
type-b network in question. The type-b 5G network identifier reveals
that this is a type-b network and not a PLMN.

The following services have been set up:

> \- network configuration service: used to provide network (e.g., DHCP)
> configuration.
>
> \- validation authority: this service provides information about the
> validity of a digital certificate (e.g., X.509) within the scope of
> the factory automation system.
>
> \- authentication server: verifies the authentication information sent
> by the clients. An authentication server may support different types
> of authentication, depending on the authentication mechanisms and
> credentials available on the field device. The Authentication server
> can provide additional information on user/client access rights.

#### 5.3.19.3 Service flows

The following tables describe the individual service flows for steps (1)
and (2) in Figure 5.3.19.1-1 (for more details on the service flows see
\[45\]). The other steps are out of scope for 3GPP. As a courtesy, they
are summarised in Annex D for interested readers. Here we assume that
the UE is integrated in the field device. We explicitly state \"UE\" in
situations where the differences matters.

**A. Connection - connect field device physically**

This step includes the preparation and physical installation of the
field device in the automation system. The communication solution chosen
is a 5G system. This step has no particular implications for the type-b
5G network.

  2              Field device prepared           Plug in field device                  Bring the field device into the proximity of the 5G radio access point.
  3              Field device plugged            Turn on field device                  Switch power button on.

NOTE: The field device may have multiple, different communication ports,
both wireless and wired.

**B. Discovery - discover field device**

This step includes the establishment of a network connection to the
type-b 5G network.

  **Sub-step**   **Event**                                     **Name of process/activity**             **Description of process/activity**

Here: type-b 5G connectivity at OSI layer three or two. The UE compares the network ID with what is stored in the field device. If PLMNs are accessible the field device does not join them since their network ID does not match the stored value.
  2              Field device recognised                       Assign network address                   Network access authentication: mutual authentication of field device and type-b 5G network using available, persistent credentials for type-b network access.
  3              Field device is addressable via the network   Notify field device management           Announce the field device to the field device management server to start configuring it. This can, for instance be done by the field device itself.

#### 5.3.19.4 Post-conditions

The intelligent field device is able to communicate in the 5G network.
The communication might be constrained according to the needs of the
actual production scenario (e.g., QoS settings; limited subset of
communication partners \[automation system zone\]).

#### 5.3.19.5 Challenges to the 5G system

> Network access authentication for field devices in type-b networks
> with credentials (e.g., device certificate for EAP-TLS).
>
> Backward compatibility of future Releases to the EAP framework.
>
> Support of different types of authentication credentials depending on
> the credentials available in a specific industrial site/application.
>
> Allow automation system functions (e.g., MES/SCADA) to control network
> access properties in type-b networks, e.g., limiting the range of
> network addresses accessible to a plug-and-produce field device.

NOTE: Field device communication is typically not an all-to-all or
many-to-many communication scenario. Wireless field networks need to
support the enforcement of predefined communication paths based on
engineering and resource planning information (\"virtual zones and
conduits\").

### 5.3.20 Type-a network ‒ PLMN interaction

#### 5.3.20.1 Description

An enterprise deploys a 5G type-a network within its factory complex.
The network supports robotic controls for the manufacturing equipment;
communications between the equipment and the UEs of the responsible
employees; and communications between employee UEs. The manufacturing
equipment is limited to receiving service only on the type-a network.
The employee UEs are capable of being used both on the type-a
network---for communicating with other devices on that network---and on
the PLMN, for communicating to other UEs outside of the type-a network.

The robotic controls require URLLC capabilities that ensure appropriate
actions are taken by the robots. As these requirements can be quite
different from those for supporting the employee UEs, the network
resources providing URLLC capabilities may be reserved for use by the
robotic controllers. This separation of resources is needed to prevent
an employee UE from using the URLLC radio or network resources, and
potentially interfering with a robotic controller's ability to precisely
control a factory robot.

UEs that do not belong to the factory are not allowed to access the
type-a network, to avoid any use of type-a network resources by
non-authorised UEs. Since the type-a network may overlap the coverage
are of one or more PLMNs, there is a risk of excessive resource usage
and churn if a UE that does not belong the factory finds a stronger
signal from the type-a network and attempts to attach to the type-a
network, only to be rejected later based on authentication or
authorisation validation. This is of particular concern for a URLLC type
capability where the churn may impact the ability of a time sensitive
factory UE (e.g., robotic controller) in receiving access to the
network.

Since some UEs also need to be able to communicate over the PLMN as well
as within the type-a network, the enterprise provides employees with a
selection of UEs and service providers/MNOs for their PLMN usage. These
UEs need to be able to support simultaneous service on both the type-a
network and PLMN, as in the case where the employee is receiving
communication from a piece of manufacturing equipment regarding a
processing problem and simultaneously consulting with a remote colleague
for the appropriate corrective action.

The system needs to support service continuity for UEs that cross
between the PLMN and the type-a network while actively engaged in a
communication. For example, an employee may call a colleague while
driving to work. When the employee reaches work and enters the building,
the UE is handed over to the type-a network, at which time the
communication continues with no disruption in service. The type-a
network may provide better coverage within the building as well as
support additional functionality related to the factory business that is
not available in the PLMN.

#### 5.3.20.2 Pre-conditions

The factory equipment is only able to access the type-a network.

The employee UEs may access both the type-a network and a PLMN.

The employee UEs may simultaneously be active on both the type-a network
and a PLMN.

The employee UEs may handover between the type-a network and PLMN when
entering or leaving the factory complex.

Non-authorised UEs are not allowed access to the type-a network.

#### 5.3.20.3 Service Flows

A piece of factory equipment detects an error condition and reports the
problem to the human supervisor. This communication may take place in a
variety of data formats, from a short text message to streaming video.

A robotic controller responds in a timely and efficient manner to an
alert from one of the factory robots, providing corrective instructions
that prevent an accident.

The supervisor needs to consult a colleague to address the issue. The
colleague is on the way to the factory, but currently outside the range
of the type-a network, so the remote colleague is currently receiving
service from the PLMN. If dual coverage is available by both the type-a
network and PLMN, the supervisor can select which to use for the
external call.

As the two colleagues are talking, the remote colleague reaches the
factory and the UE is handed over to receive service from the type-a
network where better coverage is available.

A person walking past the factory attempts to make a call using their
personal UE. The UE is only able to access the PLMN.

#### 5.3.20.4 Post-conditions

There is no disruption of service when the supervisor uses the type-a
network for communication with the factory equipment and the PLMN for
communication with the remote colleague.

There is no resource conflict between the robotic controller and the
employee UEs using the type-a network.

There is no disruption of service when the remote colleague reaches the
factory and is switched from PLMN to type-a network service.

There is no use of type-a network resources by the non-authorised UE.

### 5.3.21 Communication monitoring, diagnosis, and error analysis

#### 5.3.21.1 Description

An industrial automation application is a complex system that
encompasses many hardware and software products of different types and
from different vendors. Industrial automation systems are locally
distributed and are typically served by wired and wireless communication
networks of different types and with different characteristics. If the
production process---or one of its sub-processes---does not work
properly, there is the need to quickly find and eliminate the related
error or fault in order to avoid significant production and thus
financial losses. To that end, automation devices and applications
implement diagnosis and error-analysis algorithms as well as predictive
maintenance features.

Due to their inherent challenges, wireless communication systems are
usually under suspicion in case an error occurs in a distributed
automation application. Therefore, diagnosis and fault analysis features
for 5G communication systems are required. The 5G communication system
needs to provide sufficient monitoring information as input for such
diagnosis features.

The related communication services can be provided by a locally deployed
type-b network or type-a network or by a private slice in a PLMN.

#### 5.3.21.2 Preconditions

The 5G system is installed and commissioned, and it operates
appropriately. The distributed automation application is operating. At
least one communication between automation devices is established and at
least one communication service has been requested. One of the following
events occurs:

> \- The communication network is to be commissioned after installation,
> and performance information about the communication network needs to
> be included in the commissioning documents;
>
> \- A periodic report interval for the communication network expires;
>
> \- A periodic maintenance interval for the production system expires;
>
> \- The production process does not operate as required;
>
> \- The automation application reports an error;
>
> \- The production system transits into a safe state without obvious
> reason;
>
> \- The automation system fails, i.e. it completely seizes to operate.

#### 5.3.21.3 Service flows

The 5G system delivers one or several of the monitoring functionalities
listed below.

> \- Providing (time-resolved) information about a communication
> service\'s error behaviour;
>
> \- Providing detailed (time-resolved) QoS and error information about
> a communication service for -consecutive transmissions within a
> pre-defined time frame;
>
> \- Diagnosis of the end-to-end communication with respect to a
> particular communication layer of a communication service or
> connection; for instance: did the error occur at OSI level 2 or level
> 3?;
>
> \- Diagnosis of a communication service\'s transmission path including
> information on error location of a connection (\"trace function\");

#### 5.3.21.4 Post-conditions

The automation application has received information needed for, e.g.,

> \- Assessing the dependability of network operation;
>
> \- Assessing the dependability of the communication services;
>
> \- Excluding particular communication errors;
>
> \- Identifying communication errors;
>
> \- Analysing the location of an error including the geographic
> location of the involved network component (UE; front-haul component;
> core node);
>
> \- Activation of application-related countermeasures.

#### 5.3.21.5 Challenges to the 5G system

Special challenges to the 3GPP system associated with this use case
include the following aspects:

> \- Support mechanism for monitoring the QoS of the service in real
> time;
>
> \- Providing real time QoS parameters and event notifications to an
> application;
>
> \- Effective methods for managing the entailed high number of
> monitoring data and information records;
>
> \- Appropriate statistical methods for characterising time and error
> behaviour of communication services;
>
> \- Methods for locating errors and faults with an accuracy that is
> acceptable for automation applications.

5.4 Smart Living - Health Care
------------------------------

### 5.4*.*1 Description of vertical

Smart living is one of the verticals that is focused on transforming
healthcare through mobile health delivery, personalised medicine, and
social media e-health applications. Medical data is very sensitive and
private and requires a high degree of reliability in transporting the
data. There is already a lot of work done in this area, but 5G mobile
will play a significant part in advancing this area of study. Some of
the information transferred is low data readings and if they are
consistent then they can be transferred with low priority until there is
exceptional data that will generate an alarm to be raised. The use case
described here can be likened to any other use cases for monitoring
data. The uniqueness here is the sensitivity and privacy that is
required.

### 5.4.2 Telecare data traffic between home and remote monitoring centre

#### 5.4.2*.*1 Description

eHealth provides the capability for remote monitoring and care, this
eliminates the need for frequent visit to the doctors and it allows for
efficient management of chronic diseases for both patient and the
medics. This use case is about the automated monitoring of data and
suggests that such sensitive information should be managed in a secure
way and in some cases can allow for different level of authorisation of
this information. In some cases regular monitoring of patient data can
trigger an alarm to the patient depending on the information received or
in other cases it can trigger authorisation to some other parts of the
patient information received by other medical care bodies and finally
the same information with different level of authorisation can trigger a
warming from a consultant which requires a different but maybe higher
level of authorisation.

#### 5.4.2.2 Preconditions

Rules used to categorise different authorisation levels and criticality
of information are set in place using a policy server.

#### 5.4.2.3 Service flows

Most telecare data will need to be transferred to support real-time
critical alarm situations. Alarm situations normally initiate a voice
call. In such alarm situations, link availability and reliability are
major considerations.

In this use case it is assumed that the patient has a number of
monitoring device (wearables) which could also be part of or connected
to a 3GPP 5G device. In this scenario there are different types of
information that are collected and transferred via the 3GPP network to a
medical centre (data measuring and policy decision centre) which could
be on a 3GPP server belonging to a service provider or network operator.

The medical centre will determine the alarm level based on a policy and
based on this level will automatically request a call or text to be
initiated to either the patient (level1 decision maker), a medical
advisor (a nurse: Level2 decision maker) and or to a consultant (level 3
decision maker) informing them that the critical level has been reached
and the necessary contingency plan should be taken depending on the
severity of the alarm.

The 3GPP system will automatically set up a dedicated line of
communication in a secure manner, depending of the level of the alarm
and this will allow for the right level of confidentiality for the
information recipient warning them they need to either take their
medication or prepare to come to the hospital for further investigation.

Figure 5.4.2.3 Remote Monitoring and authorisation in Tele Care
Management

#### 5.4.2.4 Post-conditions

The system resets itself to the default state and measuring and
monitoring of data resumes.

#### 5.4.2.5 Challenges to the 5G system

Medical devices are often wearables. Sometimes the medical devices are
even implantable (e.g., an insulin pump). Wearable devices have a small
form factor. This implies that also the battery has to be small. A small
battery has two implications:

> the battery standby time will be limited unless power saving is used;
>
> the maximum output power is limited, which limits the uplink range.

Companies that supply medical devices generally want to be as much as
possible independent of local conditions. E.g., they prefer not to be
dependent on a specific subscription or application that the patient has
on his/her mobile phone (if the patient has a mobile phone) or not
dependent on specific fixed network subscriptions for in-home coverage.
Therefore, an independent mobile connection is generally preferred. This
can be implemented with power-efficient mobile access technology (e.g.,
eMTC).

In cases where a direct connection to the network is not feasible, a
transparent Relay UE may be used. This combines the advantage of the
subscription for the medical device being independent from the Relay UE
with battery and power efficient connectivity.

5.5 Smart city
--------------

### 5.5.1 Description of vertical

The smart city vertical covers data collection and processing to more
efficiently monitor and control city resources, and to provide services
to city residents. Domains include road traffic, electric and water
systems, waste management, public safety, schools, and other services.

### 5.5.2 Remote CCTV analysis

#### 5.5.2.1 Description

A video analytics company is contracted to analyse CCTV streams for
enforcing restricted zones at various related retail locations across a
country. The local cameras implement motion detection, and on detection
motion in their field of view, they live stream to the video analytics
company for analysis. The remote analysis is based on object & facial
recognition and provides informational alerts to employees at the retail
location guiding security responses.

The purpose of using a private slice in this scenario is to ensure that
the video streams have sufficient guaranteed quality of service to
remain at a high quality (i.e. no UE rate adaptation), consistent
latency & throughput to prevent buffering, and -- very importantly --
that the video stream is routed in such a way as to avoid network video
optimisation functions which would otherwise compress the feed, making
analysis more difficult.

An example of the deployment scenario is in Figure 5.5.2.1-1.

Figure 5.5.2.1-1: Public wide-area network with private slices for
industrial automation

#### 5.5.2.2 Pre-conditions

A video analytics company is contracted to analyse CCTV streams for
enforcing restricted zones at various related retail locations across a
country.

#### 5.5.2.3 Service flows

A camera is positioned and configured to monitor an emergency fire
escape and door and the camera is provisioned with network credentials
either prior to installation or remotely by (a) the MNO operating the
public network, (b) the CCTV operator via a platform offered by the MNO
operating the public network. The CCTV camera is also authorised to use
the \"CCTV\" private slice of the public network.

The CCTV camera detects motion and the CCTV camera is triggered by this
activity to stream its feed to a video analytics server via the 5G MNO
network covering the location.

The CCTV establishes a connection to the 5G MNO network to us the
\"CCTV\" private slice which offers sufficient GBR for 1080p\@30f/s with
low jitter & traffic routeing without a video optimisation server. The
CCTV camera sets up a stream to the configured remote server at the
video analytics company and the 5G MNO routes the traffic appropriately
with the requisite QoS.

The video analytics server performs object recognition (\"person\") and
then facial recognition (\"active security employee\") to determine that
this is not a threat and alerts the on-site operators of the retail
venue of the situation, including advice to cancel any ongoing alarms in
that area.

#### 5.5.2.4 Post-conditions

The remote server terminates the stream and the CCTV camera returns to
motion detection.

#### 5.5.2.5 Challenges to the 5G system

This use reuses several of the existing features of the 5G system such
as private slices supporting scalability, minimum reserved capacity, and
data isolation.

Special challenges to the 5G system associated with this use case are
the protection of the integrity of the user data.

5.6 Electric-power distribution
-------------------------------

### 5.6.1 Description of Vertical

#### 5.6.1.1 Overview

The energy sector is currently subject to a fundamental change, which is
caused by the evolution towards renewable energy, i.e. a very large
number of power plants based on solar and wind power. These changes lead
to bi-directional electricity flows and increasing dynamics of the power
system. New sensors and actuators are being deployed in the power system
to efficiently monitor and control the volatile conditions of the grid,
requiring real-time information exchange \[46\] \[47\].

The emerging electric-power distribution grid is also referred to as
Smart Grid. The smartness enhances insight into both the grid as a power
network and the grid as a system of systems. Enhanced insight improves
controllability and predictability, both of which drive improved
operation and economic performance and both of which are prerequisites
for the sustainable and scalable integration of renewables into the grid
and the potential transition to new grid architectures. Smart Grid
benefits spread across a broad spectrum but generally include
improvements in: power reliability and quality, grid resiliency, power
usage optimisation, operational insights, renewable integration, insight
into energy usage, safety and security.

Overviews of (future) electric-power distribution can be found elsewhere
in the literature \[63\]\[64\].

#### 5.6.1.2 Technical challenges of future electric-power distribution 

> \- Energy generation by a huge number of decentralised local units. In
> larger markets, hundreds of thousands of devices need to be connected

> also operate local energy storage systems. Their power system will be

> which communicate with other parts of the electric grid.
>
> \- Up to 100% of the energy will be produced from highly volatile,

The main goals of future electric-power distribution includes―among
others―the reduction of CO~2~ emissions by relying on renewable energy
sources (RES), decentralisation of energy production, continuous
matching of injected and outgoing energy levels, resource efficiency,
cost efficiency, maximum security, and reliable provisioning of services
to consumers.

These improvements are important for addressing the needs of
increasingly volatile and decentralised markets. A major enabler for all
this are inter-connected communication systems and computing
infrastructure, which interconnects control centres, substation
automation units, energy storage systems, and power plants of all sizes
in a flexible, secure and consistent manner.

Today, the vast majority of communication technologies used in the
energy sector is still wire-bound. This includes a variety of dedicated
Industrial Ethernet and power line solutions. These communication
technologies are used, for example, for interconnecting sensors,
actuators, and controllers in an electric network automation system.

Nowadays, wireless communication is primarily used for connecting smart
meters for customers of the power network. These meters only monitor the
energy consumption of the connected facility. There was no need for
wireless connectivity in the past, due to relatively static and
long-lasting installation of the power grid equipment. In addition, this
was because most existing wireless technologies fell short of the
demanding requirements of industrial applications, especially with
respect to end-to-end latency, communication service availability,
jitter, and reliability.

With the advent of future Smart Grids and 5G, however, this may change
fundamentally, since only wireless connectivity can provide the degree
of flexibility, mobility, versatility, and ergonomics that is required
for the energy networks of the future. Thus, 5G may significantly
contribute to revolutionising the way how electric energy is monitored,
stored, and controlled for the entire industry sector.

Figure 5.6.1.2 -- 1: Overview of different application areas in
electric-power distribution

In this respect, three different application areas can be distinguished,
as shown in Figure 5.6.1.2-1.

#### 5.6.1.3 Application areas in (future) electric-power distribution

The areas identified in Clause 5.6.1.2 can be briefly characterised as
follows:

**Primary frequency control with up to 100% RES:** The focus of this
application area is on the instant monitoring and control of the
frequency in the grid. In frequency control, the grid can be a
long-distance transmission network covering countries or large parts
there-of, or short-distance distribution networks connecting local
consumers and distributed producers of energy. Primary frequency control
ensures that a swift response on frequency variations is provided, while
it may not lead to returning the measured frequency to the nominal,
exact target value (e.g., 50 Hz in Europe). Typically, primary frequency
control uses decentralised or distributed control architectures allowing
taking corrective actions swiftly on a local level.

**Secondary frequency control with up to 100% RES:** The focus of this
application area is the second, less time-critical correction of the
frequency in the grid. Again, the grid can be a long-distance
transmission network covering countries or large parts there-of, or
short-distance distribution networks connecting local consumers and
distributed producers of energy. Secondary frequency control ensures
that an accurate and lasting response on frequency variations is
provided, and its goal is to return the measured frequency to the
nominal, exact target value (e.g., 50 Hz in Europe). Typically,
secondary frequency control uses centralised control architectures,
allowing frequency control units to take corrective actions across all
parts of the controlled power network.

**Distributed voltage control with up to 100% RES:** The focus of this
application area is monitoring and control of the voltage levels in
distribution networks. Sensors located close to the electric inverters
in the local grid measure the impedance on the grid and forward these
values to a voltage control unit co-located with a secondary substation
automation unit. The control unit analyses the impedance values and
determines the need for corrective actions. The correction action is a
target impedance value that is sent to the electric inverters so that
additional energy can be injected into the grid, or electric inverters
may throttle the energy added by power plants or storage systems.

Other application areas are differential protection, fault location,
isolation, and service restauration.

**A high-**level overview of the communication links is provided in
Figure 5.6.1.3-1.

to 100% RES

#### 5.6.1.4 Major challenges and particularities

Major general challenges and particularities include the following
aspects:

> 1\) Utility-grade quality of service is required for many
> applications, with stringent requirements in terms of end-to-end
> latency, communication service availability, jitter, and determinism.
>
> 2\) There is not only a single class of use cases, but there are use
> cases with a wide variety of different requirements, resulting in the
> need for a high adaptability and scalability of the 5G system.
>
> 3\) Many electric-power distribution applications have stringent
> requirements on safety, security (esp. availability, data integrity,
> and confidentiality), and privacy.
>
> 4\) The 5G system shall support a seamless integration into the
> existing (primarily wire-bound) connectivity infrastructure. For
> example, the 5G-based solution shall allow to flexibly combine the 5G
> system with other (wire-bound) technologies in the same power network.
>
> 5\) Most types of electrical equipment usually have a rather long
> lifetime, which may be 20 years or even longer. Therefore, long-term
> availability of 5G communication services and components is essential.
>
> 6\) 5G systems shall support non-public operation by deploying type-a
> network or type-b network within a local distribution grid, which are
> isolated from PLMNs. This is required by many distribution system
> owners (DSO) for security, liability, availability and business
> reasons. Nevertheless, in the case of a type-a network is deployed
> standardised and flexible interfaces shall be supported for seamless
> interoperability and seamless handovers between 5G PLMNs and dedicated
> 5G systems.
>
> 7\) The radio propagation environment in a building with energy
> generation or storage equipment can be quite different from the
> situation in other application areas of the 5G system. Inverters may
> be located in the basement of industrial buildings, where radio
> connectivity can be challenging. These buildings can host a large
> number of---often metallic---objects in the immediate surroundings of
> transmitter and receiver, as well as potentially high interference
> caused by electric machines, power transformers, and the like.
>
> 8\) The 5G system shall be able to support continuous monitoring of
> the current network state in real-time, to take quick and automated
> actions in case of problems, and to do efficient root-cause analyses
> in order to avoid any undesired interruption of the production
> processes, which may incur huge financial damage. Particularly, if a
> third-party network operator is involved, accurate SLA monitoring is
> needed as the basis for possible liability disputes in case of SLA
> violations.

#### 5.6.1.5 Description of this vertical's communication architecture

The communication architecture for electric-power distribution grids
(visualised in Figure 5.6.1.5-1) is mapped onto the power network it
serves. This communication architecture covers multiple network domains,
where each domain relates to a specific grid voltage and geographic
area. Every network domain instance clearly belongs to exactly one power
grid stakeholder.

![SmartGridCommunicationDomains.emf](media/image37.emf){width="6.428472222222222in"

Figure 5.6.1.5-1: Smart grid communication architecture \[48\]

> NOTE: CC: Control centre; DER: distributed energy resource; DSO:
> distribution system operator, HV: High voltage; LV: low voltage; MV:
> medium voltage; NMS: network management system; TSO: transmission
> system operator,

The following communication network domains can be distinguished:

> **Backbone network:** Communication network which connects the
> primary-substation LANs amongst each other and with regional control
> centres (often co-located) and central control centres.
>
> **Primary-substation LAN:** A primary substation LAN is quite complex
> and requires its own communication infrastructure that distinguishes
> between a process bus and a station bus. It is mainly based on a
> Gigabit Ethernet infrastructure.
>
> **Backhaul network:** Communication network which connects
> secondary-substation LANs with each other and with a control centre.
> This network domain might also connect to the respective
> primary-substation LAN in case the DSO and TSO roles are linked.
>
> **Secondary-substation LAN:** Network inside the secondary substation
> (today this network is quite trivial and may consist of just one
> single Ethernet switch / IP router). The secondary-substation LAN is
> implemented more in a distributed manner in US-Style regions, whereas
> the secondary-substation LAN is very often located in an encapsulated
> enclosure in Europe.
>
> **Access network:** Communication network which connects the customer
> premises or e.g., low-voltage sensors to a specific secondary
> substation.
>
> **Customer premises LAN:** In-building communication network whereas a
> customer is characterised by consumption and production of energy
> (prosumers) and the customer can be a residential, public or
> industrial prosumer.
>
> **Intra-DER Network:** For medium-sized DERs like wind/solar parks, a
> dedicated LAN is required for control, management and supervision
> purposes.
>
> **Intra-Control-Centre Network:** LAN within a DSO's or TSO's control
> centre.
>
> **Public network**: Fixed or mobile public communication network which
> offers different connectivity services either via dedicated services
> or via the open Internet.

Remarks:

> \- Each of the described communication network domains usually belongs
> to one electric-power distribution grid stakeholder.
>
> \- Some stakeholders―like aggregator or metering operator―do not own
> private communication infrastructure. Usually they connect to their
> assets / customers via a public network. Thus, public networks are an
> important part of the overall grid architecture.
>
> \- Not all communication network domains are mandatory to exist: for
> example the secondary-substation LAN can alternatively connect to
> prosumers via a public network service. In this case, no DSO-owned
> access network is required.

Mobile networks are used mainly for connecting secondary substation LANs
and DERs to control centres and primary substations and for connecting
devices like smart meters and sensors at customer premises to control
and data centres. The requirements of this communication are relatively
low regarding per-device bit rate, latency and communication service
availability/reliability.

Mission critical and real time communication (like tele-protection
communication) is usually not done with mobile networks due to the
relatively high latency, missing communication reliability/availability
guarantees and quality-of-service capabilities of 2G, 3G and 4G
networks. It is our expectation that suitably URLLC-enabled 5G systems
will change this, and that grid control functions might also be
connected via mobile networks.

### 5.6.2 Primary Frequency Control

#### 5.6.2.1 Description

Primary frequency control is among the most challenging and demanding
control applications in the utility sector. A primary frequency control
system is responsible for controlling the energy supply injected and
withheld to ensure that the frequency is not deviating more than 0,02%
from the nominal value, e.g., 50 Hz in Europe.

Frequency control is based on having sensors for measuring the features
in all parts of the network at all points where energy generation or
storage units are connected to the grid. At these points, electronic
power converters, also known as inverters, will be equipped with
communication units to send measurement values to other points in the
grid such as a frequency control unit, or receive control commands to
inject more, or less, energy into the local network.

With the widespread deployment of local generation units, ie solar power
units, or wind turbines, hundreds of thousands of such units, and their
inverters, may have to be connected in a larger power distribution
network. Therefore, wireless communications based on high-performance 5G
systems constitutes a promising approach. There are two key benefits of
this solution:

1\) Wirelessly connected devices, such as sensors, inverters, and
control units, do not need cables and wirelines connections, thus
reducing installation costs and maintenance effort.

2\) Devices can be connected and disconnected from the communications
network without any effort or restrictions, or lengthy preparations,
allowing for novel and swift set-ups.

A schematic representation of a communications network for frequency
control is provided in the figure below. The operation and maintenance
staff in the distribution management system (DMS) will define rules and
guidelines for frequency control which are forwarded to the automated
frequency control units. In turn, the frequency control units return
alerts, escalations and statistics to the DMS. Frequency sensors
continuously monitor the current frequency values at their local points,
they can share their values with the frequency control unit, which
analyses and compares the incoming measurements, and takes corrective
actions by instructing the inverters in the local grid to inject more or
less energy into the local network. Note that frequency sensors and
actuators (inverters) can be located on the same hardware device, and in
this case, would only require one communication point.

The format and contents of these messages will be defined for
standardisation by regulatory bodies.

![](media/image38.png){width="6.297916666666667in"
height="3.0236111111111112in"}

Figure 5.6.2.1-1 Schematic representation of frequency control system in
a distribution grid

Primary frequency control shall be carried out in one of three available
architecture options:

1\) Centralised control, all data analysis and corrective actions are
determined by a central frequency control unit

2\) Decentralised control, the automatic routine frequency control shall
be performed by the individual local inverter based on local frequency
values. Statistics and other information shall be communicated to the
frequency control unit, though.

3\) Distributed control, the automatic routine frequency control shall
be performed by the individual local inverter based on local and
neighbouring frequency values. Statistics and other information shall be
communicated to the frequency control unit, though.

Furthermore, there are many scenarios where specific devices (e.g.,
sensors or actuators) are added, activated, reconfigured, removed or
deactivated while the overall control system keeps on running. The
overall availability of the communications network, from an end-to-end
point of view must be at least *five Nines*, and utility companies will
demand that the total amount of planned and unplanned downtime is not
more than **5,26 minutes** per year.

In order to increase the availability level of the system, elements of
the communications network must have full redundancy and back-up units
during times of upgrade or update procedures.

#### 5.6.2.2 Preconditions

All frequency sensors, actuators/inverters, the frequency control units,
and the DMS are switched on and connected to the 5G system. Frequency
control units can be implemented locally depending upon the power system
network topology. The number of sensors, actuators/inverter, and other
devices depends upon the power system network topology.

#### 5.6.2.3 Service flows

At regular, frequent intervals, the following steps are performed. For
primary frequency control, the measurements are taken several times per
second.

1\) The frequency control unit requests measurements from all sensors in
its areas.

2\) All sensors send the measurement values to the frequency control
unit.

3\) The frequency control unit analyses and compares the incoming
measurements, and determines if corrective actions are necessary.

4\) In that case, the frequency control unit instructs the inverters in
the local grid to inject more or less energy into the local network.

5\) The inverters will return an acknowledgement signal after executing
the changes required by the frequency control unit.

All messages exchanged have to be properly secured (especially in terms
of data integrity and authenticity) and the probability of two
consecutive packet errors shall be negligible. This is because a single
packet error may be tolerable, but two consecutive packet errors may
lead to erroneous frequency correction commands, which may cause outages
of parts of the local grid. This may cause significant financial damage.

#### 5.6.2.4 Post-conditions

The components controlled by the primary frequency control system have
ensured that the frequency value is back to acceptable values. Note that
this value may not yet be the exact nominal value yet. *Secondary
frequency control* is used to ensure that the entire grid is back to
this nominal value.

#### 5.6.2.5 Challenges to the 5G system

Special challenges to the 5G system associated with this use case
include the following aspects:

\- Very stringent requirements on latency, communication service
availability, and reliability.

\- Very stringent requirements on clock synchronicity between different
nodes.

\- Transmission of rather small chunks of data, resulting in potentially
significant relative overhead due to signalling, security, etc.

\- Potentially high density of end devices, including sensors and
actuators.

### 5.6.3 Distributed Voltage Control with up to 100% RES 

#### 5.6.3.1 Description

In the evolution towards 100% RES, the objective of voltage control is
to balance the voltage in future low voltage distribution grids
connecting local loads and prosumers as well as energy storage
facilities. The aim is to stabilise the voltage as local as possible, so
that decisions and control commands can be issued as quickly as
possible.

The inverters, or electronic power converters, will measure the voltage
and power, and will also change the amount of power injected into the
grid, and connect and disconnect end-points from the distribution
network. The communication flow from the regional voltage control centre
of the DSO terminates at the inverter.

Figure 5.6.3.1-1 shows the communications network overview of a
distribution grid, where the distributed voltage control is performed by
*voltage controllers* co-located with the regional secondary substation
units. These controllers receive impedance and voltage measurements from
the inverters, analyse the data and take corrective actions by sending
commands to the inverter end-points.

The controllers will also communicate with the Distribution Management
System (DMS), sending statistics, reports, and alerts to the operations
centre, and receiving regulations and other updates from the centre.

In the future, microgrids and aggregators may operate parts of the
distribution grids, with independent voltage control. In this scenario,
these new sector actors will exchange measurements, control commands,
and other information with the supervising Distribution System Operator
(DSO).

Figure 5.6.3.1-1: Decentralised Architecture for Voltage Control

Distributed voltage control is a challenging and demanding control
application in the utility sector. Consumer devices rely on having
stable voltage levels to operate successfully. When future energy
networks rely on thousands of local energy generation units relying
mostly on solar and wind power, then it is crucial to stabilise the
voltage levels in all segments of the distribution grid.

With the widespread deployment of local generation units, i.e. solar
power units, or wind turbines, hundreds of thousands of such units, and
their inverters, may have to be connected in a larger power distribution
network. Therefore, wireless communications based on high-performance 5G
systems constitutes a promising approach. There are two key benefits of
this solution:

1\) Wirelessly connected devices, such as sensors, inverters, and
control units, do not need cables and wire lines connections, thus
reducing installation costs and maintenance effort.

2\) Devices can be connected and disconnected from the communications
network without any effort or restrictions, or lengthy preparations,
allowing for novel and swift set-ups.

Distributed control means that the automated voltage control shall be
performed by the local voltage control units based on local *and
neighbouring* voltage and impedance values. Statistics and other
information shall be communicated to the central DMS, though.

Furthermore, there are many scenarios where specific devices (e.g.,
sensors or actuators) are added, activated, reconfigured, removed or

### 5.6.4 Power distribution grid fault and outage management: distributed automated switching for isolation and service restoration for overhead lines

#### 5.6.4.1 Description

A power distribution grid fault is a stressful situation for operators
in the control centre. During the fault period, they have to perform a
lot of tasks in order to restore power to the \"healthy\" section of the
distribution grid as quick as possible. Among other activities, they
will:

\- collect and analyse grid status information;

\- identify faulty grid sections;

\- infer appropriate measures;

\- isolate the fault;

\- restore service;

\- inform service crews;

\- coordinate service crew operation;

\- restore normal grid configuration after the fault has been repaired.

In case disruptions affect a larger area―for example, during bad
weather―the level of stress further increases, because several outages
may occur at the same time. There are self-healing solutions for
automated switching, fault isolation and, service restoration. These
solutions help avoiding these stressful situations and allow operating
personnel to concentrate on repair work and service crew coordination.
Furthermore, these solutions are ideally suited to handle outages that
affect critical power consumers, such as industrial plants or data
centres. In these cases, supply interruptions must be fixed within less
than a second, and manual outage handling in a control centre usually
fails to achieve such short restoration time. Automated solutions are
able to restore power supply within a few hundred milliseconds.

> GOOSE: Generic Object-Oriented Substation Event; NOP: normal open
> point.

The FLISR (Fault Location, Isolation & Service Restoration) solution
consists of switch controller devices which are especially designed for
feeder automation applications that support the self-healing of power
distribution grids with overhead lines. They serve as control units for
reclosers and disconnectors in overhead line distribution grids.

The system is designed for using fully distributed, independent
automated devices. The self-healing logic resides in each individual
feeder automation controller located at the poles in the feeder level.
Each feeder section has a controller device with a programmable logic
controller (PLC). The PLC can be configured by the utility by help of a
graphical engineering tool. Using peer-to-peer communication among the
controller devices, the system operates autonomously without the need of
a regional controller or control centre. However, all self-healing steps
carried out will be reported immediately to the control centre to keep
the grid status up-to-date.

Modern communication systems primarily use the international IEC 61850
standard to support this distributed application. The IEC 61850 standard
provides the required flexibility and interactivity for the
implementation of self-healing functions. Peer-to-peer communication via
IEC 61850 GOOSE (Generic Object-Oriented Substation Event) message
provides analogue and binary data as fast as possible. Each controller
unit has its own comprehensive programmable logic designed by the
sequence editor of the graphical engineering tool to configure the
automation functionality according to the feeder layout. The controllers
conduct self-healing of the distribution line in typically 500 ms by
isolating the faults.

A distributed solution offers several benefits:

\- cost-efficient and future-proof solution for automatic and high speed
fault location and service restoration;

\- flexible solution supporting central and distributed configurations;

\- easy configuration and maintenance with graphical tools;

\- automated switching procedure to return to normal operation -- no
manual intervention required;

\- SCADA system connectivity to self-healing solution for monitoring and
control purposes;

\- improvement of distribution grid reliability indicators by reduction
of outages;

> \- prevention of penalties and secure power supply for critical loads
> like hospitals and data centres;

\- all logic resides on the distributed controllers; no central control
entity needed.

There are 5 ... 20 controller units per feeder ring. The geographical
dimension of feeders is usually up to several km^2^.

The peer-to-peer protection communication between controller units is
done via IEC 61850 GOOSE messages. GOOSE is basically carried in Layer 2
multicast message s. Although GOOSE Layer 3 (IP) transport has been
already specified by IEC 61850, it is currently not widely used . GOOSE
messages are sent periodically (with changing interval time) and are not
acknowledged. The GOOSE messages are sent by each controller to all
other controllers or a number of controllers of the same feeder. The
end-to-end latency requirement is less than 5 ms. The bit rate is low
(from less than 1 kb/s to several kb/s per controller) in steady state.
GOOSE bursts do occur, especially during fault situations (with bit
rates up to 1.5 Mb/s per controller). GOOSE messages are sent by a
number of controllers or all controller units of the feeder nearly at
the same point in time during the fault location, isolation and service
restoration procedure.

The control communication between the controller units and the control
centre runs via IEC 61850 MMS, IEC 60870-5-104 or DNP3 messages. These
are TCP/IP based messages. The end-to-end latency requirement is less
than 500 msec (round-robin time).

Configuration, supervision and firmware upgrade of the controller units
is performed via the mobile network from the control centre. This is
TCP/IP based communication. The latency requirement is less than 500 ms
(round-robin time).

The peer-to-peer protection communication between controller units with
IEC 61850 Layer 2 GOOSE messages is usually not encrypted by the devices
for performance reasons but authenticated and integrity protected (IEC
62351-6). The control communication between the controller units and the
control centre is usually encrypted, authenticated and integrity
protected (IEC 61850 MMS according to IEC 62351-4 and IEC 62351-6, IEC
60870-5-104, DNP3 according to IEC 62351-3 and IEC 62351-5).

There is a certificate and key management which is based on a public key
infrastructure (PKI), according to IEC 62351-9. The security servers are
usually located on the control centre side and the certificate and key
enrolment towards the controller units runs via the mobile network.

#### 5.6.4.2 Preconditions

The controller units have been mounted, connected, and configured during
commissioning and deployment. The configuration is usually not done via
the mobile network but via local wired connection.

The controller units are switched on and connected to the 5G network.

#### 5.6.4.3 Service flows

5G communication runs

\- between controller units serving the same feeder and

\- between the controller units of the whole area and the control
centre.

A feeder fault occurs.

Faults at the power distribution feeder are located and isolated by the
controller units and the healthy feeder sections are re-powered. This is
executed automatically, without operator intervention, within up to 500
ms.

#### 5.6.4.4 Post-conditions

5G communication runs and electricity is distributed through the
restored part of the distribution network.

#### 5.6.4.5 Challenges to the 5G system

The major challenge is the \"bursty\", peer-to-peer, layer-2, multicast
IEC 61850 GOOSE communication with end-to-end latency requirement of
less than 5 msec. The highest priority and reliability has to be applied
to the IEC 61850 GOOSE message transmission. Message loss and corruption
shall be avoided as much as possible. Interference with other, lower
priority traffic shall be minimised.

There are stringent requirements on communication service availability
and reliability, which can be achieved, among others, by appropriate
resilience and redundancy measures. The duration of communication
service interruptions must be minimised as much as possible (high
maintainability).

Wireless communication with the controller units must not be interrupted
or disturbed in case of power grid failure in affected area. This means
the 5G base stations etc. need to provide uninterruptible power supplies
(UPSs) or similar solutions.

Some power utilities require non-public wireless communication solution
either operated by their own or by a service provider under contract.
SLAs are common when service providers are involved.

Other power utilities require virtual type-a networks over a PLMN.
Traffic separation, QoS, and SLAs are essential.

The controller units usually implement state-of-the-art, end-to-end
security measures like authentication, integrity protection and
encryption. The security features of mobile networks can provide an
additional level of security, e.g., for the unencrypted IEC 61850 GOOSE
messages. The data encryption in the mobile network shall not result in
exceeding the aforementioned end-to-end latency requirement of the
time-critical IEC 61850 GOOSE communication.

Furthermore, the mobile network shall provide capabilities of
denial-of-service prevention, particularly on the air interface.

### 5.6.5 Smart Grid: synchronicity between the entities

#### 5.6.5*.*1 Description

In electric power distribution, phasor measurement units (PMUs) are
deployed along the power line. The PMUs are used for real-time
measurement and monitoring of frequency/voltage/power to reflect the
state of the system. When a fault happens, the power line generates two
voltage waves at the fault location in two directions along the power
line. Two PMUs, on both sides of the fault location, detect the waves by
the change of frequency/voltage/power and record the time of receiving
the wave. Both PMUs report the time to the server. The server can then
calculate the fault location according to the time difference of wave
detection at the two PMUs. Thus, the measurement time of the samples
produced by PMUs along the same power line needs to be highly
synchronised; otherwise the calculation of fault location is imprecise.

In current PMU solutions, time synchronisation is achieved by
time-stamping the measured synchro-phasor values. For this purpose,
high-precision time sources, e.g. GNSS clocks are used at PMU locations.
Based on this procedure, there are currently no specific requirements on
clock synchronisation of the communication network.

All PMUs are switched on and connected to the 5G system. A UE is

power line.

#### 5.6.5.3 Service flows

1\) Changes in electricity frequency/voltage/power is detected by (some)
PMUs along the power line.

2\) All PMUs send their measurements (the change of the
frequency/voltage/power and the corresponding time) to the server. The
PMU clocks should be synchronised with each other in the order of 1μs or
below so that the timestamp for the measurements is accurate and
reliable.

3\) The server analyses the information provided by the PMUs and
determines the fault location.

#### 5.6.5.4 Post-conditions

The server can inform the fault location to the reparation team.

### 5.6.6 Application of differential protection in distribution Network of Smart Grid

#### 5.6.6.1 Description

As the number of distributed power plants connecting to the electrical
grid increases worldwide, the fault characteristics of power
distribution grids has changed. Traditional methods cannot fully meet
the new fault location and isolation needs. Differential protection (DP)
has been widely used in HVAC systems and can meet these needs in
distribution grids. DP has the following advantages: simple principle,
high reliability, precise selection.

The working principle of DP is as follows. Several distribution
termination units (DTUs) compose the protection zone of DP. All DTUs
exchange their current values with neighbour DTUs in a strictly cyclic
pattern. A timestamp is associated with each current value, and the time
stamp indicates when the current value was sampled. If a fault occurs
outside the protection zone, the differential current among all DTUs is
almost zero. If the fault occurs inside the protection zone, the
differential current exceeds a threshold, protection is released, and
the circuit breaker cuts off the circuit. By so doing the fault is
isolated. Synchronisation of the DTU measurement with the voltage phase
is very important.

As illustrated in Figure 5.6.6.1-1, all DTUs (e.g., DTU-1, DTU-2, DTU-3)
are synchronised with neighbouring DTUs in the distribution grid with a
precission of 10 µs to ensure that the current value was sampled at the
same time. The DTU samples the current 24 times within each 20 ms so
that a transfer interval of 0,833 ms is required to exchange the sampled
information. Th e exchange of measurement samples is done in a strictly
cyclic and deterministic manner. The messages, containing sampled
current values, voltage values and so on, are transmitted from a DTU to
its neighbouring DTUs with an end-to-end latency of less than 15 ms. The
message size is approximately 250 bytes according to IEC 61850,
resulting in a service data rate of at least 2 Mbit/s.

Nowadays, DP can be implemented based on cable transmission
characterised by high operation and maintenance efforts and high
deployment cost. But in distribution networks, a great quantity of
stations is needed to achieve wide coverage, so it is not appropriate to
implement the established version of DP.

Figure 5.6.6.1-1: DP implementation in distribution grid

#### 5.6.6.2 Preconditions

DTU-1, DTU-2 and DTU-3 (see Figure 5.6.6.1-1) are deployed and switched
on in the distribution grid. The DTUs sample the current values
according to a pre-defined period.

#### 5.6.6.3 Service flow

1\) DTU-2 sends its sampled current value to DTU-1 and DTU-3 in a
periodic pattern.

2\) DTU-2 receives the sampled current values from DTU-1 and DTU-3 in a
periodic pattern.

3\) DTU-2 calculates the difference between the current values
simultaneously sampled by DTU-1 and DTU-2.

> The difference value between DTU-1 and DTU-2 exceeds a threshold;
> DTU-2 shuts down the circuit between DTU­1 and DTU-2.
>
> DTU-2 calculates the difference between the current value
> simultaneously sampled by DTU-3 and DTU-2.
>
> The difference value between DTU-3 and DTU-2 does not exceed the
> threshold; no further actions are triggered by DTU-2.

DTU-1 and DTU-3 carry out the same procedure as DTU-2.

#### 5.6.6.4 Post-conditions

The fault between DTU-1 and DTU-2 is isolated in due time.

#### 5.6.6.5 Challenges to 5G system

### 5.6.7 Smart Grid : Millisecond-level precise load control

#### 5.6 7*.*1 Description

Precise load control is an important basic application for
power-distribution grids. When critical HVDC (high-voltage direct
current) transmission faults happen, millisecond-level precise load
control is used to quickly remove interruptible less-important loads,
such as electric vehicle charging and non-continuous production power
supplies in factories.

Millisecond-level precise load control includes a control primary
station and load control terminals. Load information (e.g., total amount
of interruptible load, load shedding control commands) is communicated
between the control primary station and the load control terminals.

Millisecond-level precise load control system poses ultra-low end-to-end
latency requirements on the communication network. From the beginning of
the fault information collection to the successful removal of loads, the
end-to-end latency of the 5G network is less than 50 ms.

For security reasons, precise load control is a service in the
production area of the power grid. It must be completely isolated from
services in management areas.

#### 5.6 7*.*2 Preconditions

All load control terminals are switched on and connected to the 5G
system. The load control terminals include a UE each.

#### 5.6.7.3 Service flows

1\) The load control terminals report the total amount of interruptible
load.

2\) A test instrument simulates the HVDC transmission fault and the
control primary station receives the fault analyses.

3\) The control primary station decides to shed interruptible load and
sends load shedding control commands to the corresponding load control
terminals.

4\) Load shedding is successfully executed.

5\) Load control terminals report the results to the control primary
station.

#### 5.6.7.4 Post-conditions

The successful shedding of interruptible less-important load s, and HVDC
transmission fault is cleared.

#### 5.6.7.5 Challenges to the 5G system

Special challenge to the 5G system associated with this use case
includes the following aspects:

\- ultra-low end-to-end latency: milliseconds;

\- strong isolation: precise load control is a service in the production
area of the power distribution grid; its communication must be
completely isolated from that of other services;

\- high communication service availability: 99 ,9999 %.

5.7 Centralised power generation
--------------------------------

### 5.7*.*1 Description of vertical

This domain comprises all aspects of centralised power generation, i.e.
the centralised conversion of chemical energy and other forms of energy
into electrical energy. Typical electric-power outputs are 100 MW and
more. Examples for pertinent systems are large gas turbines, steam
turbines, combined-cycle power plants, and wind farms. The planning and
installation of respective equipment and plants as well as the
operation, monitoring and maintenance of these plants is encompassed by
this vertical domain.

### 5.7.2 Run-time access to operational data and control information

#### 5.7.2*.*1 Description

This use case covers applications which feature (temporary) access to an
existing local plant control system via wireless connections. The access
interface on a handheld device is typically a graphical user interface
fitted to the mobile device. The graphical user interface can be similar
to the control room operator display.

Monitoring as well as control information is transported between the
power unit and the handheld device.

There are two basis application scenarios: (1) on-site mobile access,
for example for commissioning or maintenance work; (2) remote access to
unmanned, fully-automated power units for controlling them.

#### 5.7.2.2 Preconditions

mobile device is carried out. The information transported to and fro the
mobile device conveys states of and changes in process parameters,
control settings, and/or power unit characteristic parameters with
stringent real-time requirements.

#### 5.7.2.4 Post-conditions

The 5G connection is terminated on the handheld device side.

#### 5.7.2.5 Challenges to the 5G system

(documentation of work piece quality) or raw signals from vibration
measurements (event diagnosis). Note that this data does not entail
real-time requirements. For a new plant, wired communication
infrastructures can fulfil the respective communication needs, but there
might be cases, for instance retrofitting of legacy installations or
remote installations, for which an implementation of a wired
communication infrastructure is not viable

### 5.7.5 Customised access of stakeholders to wind power plant network

#### 5.7.5.1 Description

This use case covers the dynamic setup of communication services with
different service requirements for different users or stakeholders in a
communication network of a wind farm. Users or stakeholders are wind
power plant operators, grid operators, maintenance personnel, transport
services such as helicopters and ships, remote service centres, etc.
This use case focuses on wind power plant communication networks. A
particular focus is on offshore wind farms due to more difficult
physical access to these remote installations.

The objective of the use case is to provide customised access for
different stakeholders to the communication network in a wind power
plant. In particular, this use case addresses the configuration of
network devices in the wind power plant communication network. The goal
of this configuration is to enable network management, monitoring of
wind turbines, surveillance (audio and video), and various other
value-added services. For this purpose, QoS tailored to the applications
and, as well as tenant-based access management, need to be ensured. The
communication flows triggered by the different tenants need to be
isolated from each other.

![cav-figure-5](media/image43.emf){width="6.690277777777778in"
height="3.61875in"}

Figure 5.7.5.1-1: Example of a communication network for a wind power
plant.

A wind power plant or wind farm consists of many, up to several hundred
wind turbines.

Figure 5.7.5.1-1 shows the exemplary structure of a wind power plant
communication network. The wind power plant communication network is
deployed as a type-a 5G network. It has to support deterministic
communication services with demanding vertical requirements as well as
industrial communication standards from the vertical domain. The network
is used by internal, local supervisory control and data acquisition
(SCADA), SCADA servers, turbine switches, and turbine servers. The power
plant communication network offers external interfaces for remote
services such as maintenance access, energy regulation, and grid
response. The physical communication network contains mainly wired fibre
links, but radio links are also used in some deployments. Examples for
the usage of radio links are access to difficult-to-reach areas, to
moving parts (rotor blades), and for temporary setups.

Furthermore, each wind turbine has a local wind turbine controller for
autonomous and local control of the wind turbine. These are connected to
the wind power plant communication network, but they do not rely on
continuous connectivity through the wind power plant communication
network since these controllers can operate autonomously if so required.

The local control centre system (SCADA) is part of the wind power plant
communication network and is located at the network edge. This means
that the devices with their network interfaces are part of the wind
power plant communication network. The local control centre provides a
network interface to external, wide area networks that can be used by a
remote service centre. The local control centre might be in a geographic
location that is difficult to reach. For instance, the local control
centre might be close to the actual off-shore wind farm at sea, many sea
miles away from the shore.

SCADA systems are the main monitoring and management component in a wind
power plant. They are utilised for data collection and analytics, as
well as for the remote maintenance and control of wind turbines. SCADA
helps operators with interpreting how well the wind turbines are working
and with scheduling power production and similar activities. Moreover,
SCADA is often coupled with additional data analytics and asset
management software in order to gain an overview of core business
processes, performance of the wind power plant, and storing and handling
of client and customer information.

Typical SCADA applications in a wind farm are

> \- management of wind turbine equipment;
>
> \- control applications for controlling the wind turbine operation;
>
> \- surveillance applications carrying remote video/audio data used for
> supervising the area in and around the turbine. This includes video
> and audio, which is very helpful for remote support of technicians in
> off-shore turbines. For instance, the video feed is used to visually
> check that the rotors and the landing pad of an offshore wind turbine
> are in a safe state prior to hoisting technicians by helicopter. It's
> also used to visually capture the helicopter during the hoist
> situation, to remote control from the helicopter based on visual
> feedback, and to stream video from the helicopter to, e.g., the
> control centre;
>
> \- monitoring of parameters of the wind turbine (collection of sensor
> information). This includes reports about power production.

NOTE: During the maintenance phase the aforementioned helicopter might
leave the coverage area of the wind power plant communication network.
In such cases, it is beneficial if an adjacent PLMN can provide service
continuity for at least some of the related communication services, e.g.
for supporting the video stream to and from the helicopter to, e.g., the
control centre.

The converged management, monitoring, surveillance, and control
applications all transmit over the same physical communication network.
The management, monitoring, control, and surveillance applications
typically have different functional scopes and different QoS
requirements. Field-level control traffic typically requires real-time
guarantees in terms of end-to-end latency, jitter (timeliness), and
capacity (data throughput).

Examples of SCADA control applications requiring strict end-to-end
latency bounds and reliable delivery are grid regulation signalling and
transmission of grid protection signals. Although most individual
actuators in a wind turbine are controlled autonomously by a local
turbine controller, the SCADA might override the local configuration in
order to globally optimise production or to enforce production limits.
Therefore, SCADA will also apply blade pitch angle configurations,
modifications to generator speed, yaw rotation actions or
enabling/disabling of individual turbines or whole wind power plants
based on the production limit thresholds.

Remote video surveillance, on the other hand, might have relaxed
requirements in terms of end-to-end delay, but it requires a relatively
high bandwidth (capacity, data throughput).

Specific security and isolation network properties need to be in place,
since not all stakeholders of the wind farm should be allowed to access
the local sensor, monitoring, and surveillance data. Temporary,
restricted access to the local sensor, monitoring, and surveillance data
needs to be granted to external stakeholders such as the helicopter
company.

Furthermore, some wind turbine sensors (e.g., wind speed and direction)
might transmit information where delayed arrival of packets---or even
the loss of some packets over a small number of sample
measurements---might be acceptable. However, other sensor information,
such as the temperature input for determining thermal stability extremes
or high vibration level alarms, might require immediate action and thus
timely and dependable communication. A state-of-the-art wind turbine may
host up to 3000 sensors, which provide input to local turbine
controllers. The turbine controllers often host multiple data
pre-processing modules, all communicating back to the central SCADA.
Each of these communication flows typically comes with its own QoS. Due
to regulation, reporting on power production has specific requirements
on the application and the communication.

Managing large wind power plants also means managing a large number of
wind turbines and an ever-growing number of locally hosted applications
and data sources. This results in the need for dynamic connectivity and
large bandwidths. Current wind power plants may consist of up to 650
wind turbines on-shore and up to 200 wind turbines off-shore.

The introduction of new services with added value services will require
application-specific network configurations to reflect the stakeholder's
access rights and communication requirements. Examples for such services
are as follows.

> \- Active and proactive power production---in accordance with a
> dynamic electricity market---will require the flexible management of
> distributed energy resources and energy storage capacities based on
> the per-minute saturation of the energy market and the related pricing
> model.
>
> \- External stakeholders, such as grid operators or maintenance and
> support personnel, require insight into the capabilities and
> (diagnostic) information of the wind power plant in order to utilise
> its capabilities (e.g., reaction to grid errors, production and
> consumption of reactive energy when there is little wind, etc.) and to
> perform monitoring, maintenance, and repairs.
>
> \- The deployment of data mining and remote pattern matching
> techniques for early fault recognition and identification of
> irregularities will result in a wide range of additional scenarios,
> requiring automated setups and configuration of deterministic network
> services in order to provide sensor data for processing in externally
> or internally hosted data analytics appliances.
>
> \- On-demand wireless connectivity for on-site maintenance personnel
> would be advantageous. The maintenance personnel will thus be enabled
> to easily performing maintenance tasks such as reading out
> characteristic parameters and running test procedures. Strict access
> rules and safety regulations have to be followed for these kind of
> communication scenarios.
>
> \- Remote control of wind power plant services by a remote wind power
> plant service centre through external wide area networks.

Customised access for different stakeholders of wind power plants
entails that the access for a particular service might be

> \- dynamic: it has a limited time duration and is setup during
> operation (unscheduled or scheduled);
>
> \- limited: it contains only a constrained number of devices;
>
> \- demanding: it has strict; industrial-grade QoS requirements;
>
> \- restricted: it has access to a limited functionality only;
>
> \- separated: it is isolated from other communication services in the
> wind power plant communication network.

Today, grouping and isolation of the different communication flows of
the wind power plant applications is usually done by configuring VLANs
in wind power plant communication networks. Reconfiguration of VLANs is
required for customised access for different stakeholders for particular
application services.

A fast and flexible---ideally automated---way for the dynamic
introduction and deployment of communication services in a wind power
plant network is required. It needs to be tailored to the applications
and the stakeholders. Since stakeholders typically belong to different
organisations and subsets thereof, the wind power plant communication
network needs to support multi-tenancy. The network needs thus to
consider the access level and access rights associated with the
requesting stakeholder. The wind power plant communication network also
needs to provide customised access to specific tenants and ensure
adequate isolation and service quality for different (internal and
external) applications during the network runtime. The invocation of
communication services can be quite dynamic.

#### 5.7.5.2 Preconditions

The wind power plant communication network is up and running. Static
communication services have been configured and instantiated. They
satisfy different sets of service requirements of the communication
services. These services support, for instance, deterministic control
traffic, dependable sensor information transmission, and best effort
sensor data transmission. The communication services might be running
within the wind turbine only, between the wind turbines and the internal
SCADA, or between end points of the wind power plant network and a
remote service centre. The communication services are requested by
different stakeholders with different access rights (multi-tenancy).

The wind power plant communication network supports dynamic
instantiation of communication services by exposing corresponding
interfaces and implementing the decision-making methods on where and how
to position the new services.

The wind power plant operator or the end-node applications know their
own requirements on the communication services in terms of QoS
parameters requested via the communication service network interface.
The service requirements are described in accordance with the
communication service request model provided by the service interface of
the communication network. Wind power plant operator and end-node
applications possess the knowledge of their connectivity, QoS, and
security requirements for correct operation by means of service
monitoring and unique service IDs.

The wind power plant communication network can limit or allow addition
of new services based on stakeholder access rights, available network
resources, and current network state.

Reachability between the communication service end points (applications,
controllers, SCADA, etc.) is supported by a suitable network design.

#### 5.7.5.3 Service flows

This clause describes a usage scenario in a wind power plant network.
This usage scenario contains several scenarios with encompasses several
occurrences of the use case "Customised access of stakeholders to wind
power plant network" in different situations with different
communication service requirements and different stakeholders.

In a first step, new permanent application functionality is added to an
existing wind power plant network (data analytics functionality). This
new functionality triggers a predictive maintenance action in a second
step. The maintenance process is done in several stages.

The different use case occurrences in the scenarios follow the same
general principle and general service flow. This general service flow is
given after the description of the different steps of the usage
scenario.

##### 5.7.5.3.1 Scenario: adding new functionality

New data analytic functionality for predictive maintenance is installed
at the wind turbine controllers with a remote software update. The new
functionality is added for continuous, permanent use. In principle,
there is no deadline assigned to this software installation.

The communication network sets up communication services for the
software distribution (best effort, perhaps with a deadline; also see
Clause 5.7.3.6).

For the operation of the new data analytics functions, the communication
network of the wind power plant sets up communication services for the
transmission of collected data or aggregated data analytic information
between the wind turbine controllers and the SCADA, the remote service
centre, or even an external data analytics provider. The access to the
wind power plant communication network, especially if an external
stakeholder is involved, needs to be restricted to the data relevant for
the data analytics task.

##### 5.7.5.3.2 Scenario: triggering of a maintenance action

A maintenance case is triggered either due to predicted maintenance
(based on the new data analytics functionality) or scheduled
maintenance.

If the maintenance case is triggered due to predicted maintenance based
on the new data analytics functionality (see Clause 5.7.5.3.1), a
communication service is required between the data analytics
functionality and a local or remote service centre. Predictive
maintenance action of a certain wind turbine is triggered only rarely,
and the transmission of the predictive maintenance request comes with
relaxed delay requirements. Therefore, the communication service can
usually be setup on-demand.

##### 5.7.5.3.3 Scenario: maintenance action -- first stage: acquisition of additional information

In the case of an impending maintenance action, the remote service
centre and the personnel on location require on-demand access to
additional sensor data based on the respective maintenance case.
Communication services are set up through the wind power plant
communication network between the remote service centre / personnel on
location and the wind turbine controller for accessing additional,
case-based sensor data and information.

The additional sensor data might include video surveillance of the wind
turbine in question. The video can be used for a remote visual
evaluation of the wind turbine. Communication services for video
surveillance are setup between the video cameras on and around the wind
turbine and the remote service centre / the personnel on location. The
communication service has service requirements based on the
particularities of video transmission. These are mainly requirements
toward bandwidth, communication service availability, communication
service reliability, and a typically rather relaxed end-to-end latency.
It is important that these high-bandwidth communication services must
not interfere with the existing and ongoing deterministic control
traffic of the wind turbines and the wind power plant.

Only authenticated users are granted access to the aforementioned
information and communication services on additional sensor data and
video surveillance. At this stage, the involved users are presumably
internal stakeholders that have to evaluate the technical parameters of
the wind turbine and that have to decide on the next steps for the
maintenance.

##### 5.7.5.3.4 Scenario maintenance action -- second stage: preparation for on-site maintenance action

If the decision is made for on-site maintenance by technicians, the wind
turbine in question has to be prepared for carrying out this maintenance
action. A particular focus is on the safety of the technicians.

Communication services for video surveillance of the actual situation at
the wind turbine in question are setup between the video cameras on and
around the wind turbine and the remote service centre / the personnel on
location. First, it is important to monitor the weather conditions
(wind, sleet, rain ...). It might be possible to wait for good weather
when carrying out a maintenance action triggered by predictive
maintenance analytics.

Weather conditions permitting, the maintenance technicians are flown to
and hoisted to the wind turbine by helicopter. Before the technicians
can land on the landing pad, the wind turbine has to be put into a safe
state, the vanes of the wind turbine and the landing pad in particular.
A communication service is set up between the local control centre and
the wind turbine controller for stopping the wind turbine. While the
service requirements for the communication that triggers the shutdown of
the wind turbine are rather relaxed with respect to maximum latency and
data throughput, they are strict with respect to communication service
availability, communication service reliability, authentication, and
authorisation. Only authorised personnel is allowed to shut down a wind
turbine. Furthermore, the control communication service between the wind
turbine controller and the actuators of the wind turbine usually comes
with strict and demanding requirements concerning latency, communication
service availability, and communication service reliability. The
shutdown of the wind turbine will be monitored with several video feeds.
Respective communication services for video surveillances have to be set
up.

A further communication service for video surveillance needs to be set
up between the wind turbine and the helicopter, so that the pilot can
monitor the hoisting and arrival of the technicians before leaving for a
helicopter platform. Furthermore, some wind turbine functions might be
remote controlled from the helicopter based on video surveillance.
Surveillance video is sometimes also streamed from the helicopter to,
e.g., the control centre; it is beneficial if this video stre am is not
interrupted when the helicopter (accidentally) leaves the coverage area
of the wind power plant communication network and the video is streamed
via an adjacent PLMN.

The communication services for video surveillance have service
requirements based on the particularities of video transmission (mainly
requirements pertaining to bandwidth, communication service
availability, communication service reliability, and a typically rather
relaxed end-to-end latency). These high-bandwidth communication services
must not interfere with existing and ongoing deterministic control
traffic of the wind turbines and the wind power plant.

Furthermore, specific security and isolation network properties need to
be in place, e.g., secured and isolated connection and deployment and
strict use of authentication and authorisation mechanism. This is
necessary since this activity includes several stakeholders, both
internal and external, and only selected stakeholders should be allowed
access to the local surveillance data. Furthermore, the access needs to
be restricted to a minimum of data and devices, so that only information
that is necessary for the maintenance action is actually made available.

##### 5.7.5.3.5 Scenario maintenance action -- third stage: carrying out on-site maintenance

Future deployments of wind power plant communication networks may allow
wireless access of maintenance personnel to the communication network
and data of a wind turbine on location. In this case, the technicians
will request access to the wind power plant communication network. For
security and safety reasons, the access has to follow very strict
authentication and authorisation rules, so that only authorised devices
and authorised personnel can access the actuators and data of a wind
turbine. Furthermore, the access of the technicians will be restricted
to the actuators and data of the wind turbine in question and to the
respective data of the wind turbine in the local control centre.

The maintenance device of the technicians requests setup of
communication services in order to access the relevant data of the wind
turbine and the local control centre (SCADA). These communication
services are usually subject to rather relaxed end-to-end latency
requirements.

The technicians may perform certain test procedures at the wind turbine
by means of their maintenance device. Such a test procedure might be
testing the rotation of the wind mill vanes. The rotation will be
controlled at the maintenance device. The maintenance device needs to
setup a dependable communication service with the actuators of wind mill
vanes for this deterministic control traffic. This communication service
is also characterised by a low end-to-end latency.

After the maintenance is finished, the set up communication services for
the maintenance tasks need to be disengaged (torn down). First, the
technicians tear down the communication services between their
maintenance devices and the communication network at the wind turbine in
question.

Communication services for voice communication are needed throughout the
entire maintenance action. These services are needed for voice
communication between the technicians on-site at the wind turbine and
for voice communication between the technicians on the wind turbine and
the staff at the local control centre.

After their safe return to their base location, the communication
services for the video surveillance are disengaged (torn down).

#### 5.7.5.4 Post-conditions

All communication services related to the maintenance action have been
disengaged (torn down). The wind power plant communication network is
mostly in the same configuration as before the service flows in Clause
5.7. 5.3. Furthermore, communication services for the added continuous
data analytics functionality for predictive maintenance are running.

#### 5.7.5.5 Challenges to the 5G system

##### 5.7.5.5.1 General challenges

The 5G system needs to provide interfaces for the dynamic setup of
communication services with different service requirements, fulfilling a
wide range of service requirements.

The 5G system needs to support isolation of communication services and
of stakeholders.

The 5G system needs to enable effective authentication and authorisation
or capabilities for deploying application-specific authentication and
authorisation methods.

The 5G system needs to provide a LAN service for migration scenarios.
VLAN configurations of today's wind power plant communication networks
need to be supported by the 5G system.

The 5G system needs to provide authenticated and authorised access to
remote stakeholders such as a remote service centre. The remote
stakeholder communicates with the type-a 5G network (wind power plant
communication network) through wide area networks, possibly 5G networks
of 5G network operators.

The 5G system needs to support a potentially large number of
communication services (scalability). The wind power plant communication
network might contain half to one million of sensors and actuators, many
communication services for the control of the wind turbines, plus
several other dynamically set up communication services for specific
events such as maintenance, remote service, and monitoring access. Some
communication services might be restricted to specific areas such as a
wind turbine; others might cover the entire wind power plant
communication network.

The 5G system needs to support communication services identifiers and
priorities of communication services. Communication services with high
priority such as for emergency overwrites need to preempt non-essential
communication services if necessary (insufficient network resources).

A possible solution for high communication service availability and high
reliability is multi-path connectivity. In order to use multi-path for
demanding dependable communication services, the 5G system needs to
support multi-path transmissions and their setup.

NOTE: A possible means of admission control for communication services
is multi-constrained path selection. It allows satisfying the different
sets of requirements of the dynamically set up communication services.

##### 5.7.5.5.2 KPIs for communication services in wind power plant communication networks

The KPIs of communication services in a wind power plant communication
network are listed in Table 5.7.5.5.2-1. The KPIs of the communication
service are measured over the operation time of the particular service.

5.8 Programme Making and Special Events (PMSE)
----------------------------------------------

### 5.8.1 Description of vertical

#### 5.8.1.1 Overview

The Programme Making and Special Events (PMSE) industry is the main
driver behind professional equipment for the culture and creative
industry (CCI). The PMSE industry comprises all kind of production,
event and conference technologies. It can be categorised into audio
(e.g., microphones, in-ear monitor), video (e.g., cameras, displays and
projectors) and stage control systems.

In today's typical professional live production setups, lot of wireless
PMSE equipment is in use. For instance, artists on stage use wireless
microphones in combination with wireless in-ear monitoring systems.
Another example is the delivery of live content from wireless cameras to
big video panels placed around the stage. Every wireless audio/video
link is composed of one transmitter and its destined receiver, which
provides the input data for the further processing chain, or in case of
an in-ear monitor system the audio stream for the artist on stage.

From a PMSE point of view, the complete on-site 5G system may be seen as
part of a local high quality PMSE network (see Figure 5.8.1.1-1),
processing audio and video data streams with a guaranteed quality of
service regarding latency, audio/video quality, number of wireless links
per site and reliability, as well as control data for remote control of
wireless devices. Such local, high-quality wireless networks for audio
and video are relevant for all kind of live production sites, such as
concerts, TV shows, sports events, theatres and musicals, press
conferences, and electronic news gathering.

The live event scenario, based on a local high-quality wireless network,
offers the possibility to establish new kinds of audience services,
e.g., individualised audio mixes or different camera angles, both of
which provide new means of user experience. The respective content can
be received with future standard consumer hardware (e.g., smartphones).
These services also might help people with impaired vision or hearing to
follow live events.

In the following, some of the most relevant PMSE use cases are described
and analysed in detail. These use cases can be mapped to relevant PMSE
application areas as shown in Table 5.8.1.1-1.

#### 5.8.1.2 Major challenges and particularities

Major general challenges and particularities of the PMSE industry
include the following aspects:

1\) There is not only a single class of use cases, but there are several
different use cases with a wide variety of different requirements. This
implies the need for adaptability and scalability of the 5G system.

2\) Typical PMSE deployment scenarios are confined in a local
geographical area and show short-term (e.g., from some hours to some
weeks) to long-term (e.g., from some months to some years) durations.

3\) Typical professional live production setups come with stringent
requirements in terms of end-to-end latency, communication service
availability, communication service reliability, jitter, audio/video
quality, number of wireless links per site, and synchronicity. Failures
of wireless links during a live event or a live production are
unacceptable for the CCI and their customers. Therefore, additional
efforts towards improved transmission robustness and a more effective
interference management have to be considered.

**4) For** reliable operation of the wireless equipment, professional
PMSE requires controlled interference environments, e.g., through
appropriate spectrum access and interference mitigation techniques.

5\) There is a growing demand from the end users for new and more
differentiated services. Examples are augmented reality (AR), virtual
reality (VR) and other new immersive experiences. These services will
require increasing spectrum availability.

6\) Use cases of typical PMSE applications, as described in the
following sections, are not yet covered by the technical requirements of
the ongoing discussions within Media & Entertainment (M&E) sector by
3GPP. This is because, so far, the M&E sector has focused only on media
distribution and reception rather than on production and live
audio/video production that brings in requirements of a URLLC use-case.

7\) 5G systems need to support type-b network and type-a network
deployment and operation within an event location. This is required by
many PMSE operators for security, liability, availability and business
reasons. Nevertheless, standardised and flexible interfaces shall be
supported for seamless interoperability and seamless handovers between
PLMNs and type-a network deployments.

8\) The 5G system shall be able to support continuous monitoring of the
current network state in real-time, to take quick and automated actions
in case of problems, and to conduct efficient root-cause analyses in
order to avoid any undesired interruption of the A/V content production,
which may incur huge financial damage. Particularly, if a third-party
network operator is involved, accurate run-time SLA monitoring is needed
as the basis for possible liability disputes in case of SLA violations
(see Clauses 4.3.4.2 and 4.3.4.3).

### 5.8.2 Low-latency audio streaming for live performance

#### 5.8.2.1 Description

Live performance applications are divers, which implies that e.g.,
latency limited or requirements for privacy and so on may be considered
for differently for different scenarios. However, this document tries to
summarise requirements so that most typical use-cases are covered.

In a demanding professional live-performance scenario, artists on stage
use wireless microphones while hearing themselves via the wireless IEM
system. Communication services are limited to the stage where the
performance is taking place, i.e. the service area has local character
(see Table 5.8.2-1). Artists may be moving with considerable speeds (up
to 50 km/h, see Table 5.8.2-1) around the service area, for instance if
wearing roller skaters. The audio signal coming from the microphone is
streamed to a mixing console, where the different incoming audio streams
are mixed. After mixing, several audio streams can be distinguished,
e.g., the Public Address (PA), the individual IEM, or recording mixes.
Here, IEM mixes are transmitted wirelessly, whereas most of the other
signals are streamed via wired connections.

Figure 5.8.2.1-1 shows the typical topology of current live performance
use cases. The whole setup follows a link-based approach, meaning that
every wireless audio link is based on one specific mobile terminal
connected to one specific installed transmitter (IEM) or receiver
(microphone). Similar setups can be found in live events such as TV
shows, sports events, musicals, and press conferences.

![logical topology of live performance use
case](media/image45.emf){width="5.166666666666667in"
height="5.011805555555555in"}

Figure 5.8.2.1-1: Logical topology of the live performance use case

The low latency audio streaming use case addresses key issues of
wireless audio production, and focuses on low-latency and
high-reliability aspects \[50\]. Even if the number of active wireless
audio links or data rates of the respective wireless audio streams may
vary, the requirements regarding end-to-end latency, communication
service availability and communication service reliability remain
principally the same for all kind of live audio streaming applications.

The application latency of the wireless audio-production system (Figure
5.8.1-2) must be much lower than the application latency of other speech
transmissions systems, like telephony services. This is because the
audio source (e.g., a microphone) and the audio sink (e.g., an in-ear
monitor \[IEM\]) are co-located at the head of the performing artist.
Due to human physiology (i.e. cranial bones conduction) an end-to-end
application latency greater than 4 ms would confuse the performing
artist while hearing himself through the IEM. Even though, this is the
most demanding scenario it is very common and challenges various aspects
of system design.

Low-latency streaming applications require high synchronicity between
all related devices. Therefore, a system clock, e. g., a word clock, is
provided by an external word clock generator. This generator can be a
dedicated device or it can be integrated, e.g., into the audio mixing
console. Timestamps are typically used to determine playback times of
digital audio data. All wireless audio devices involved in the live
performance production network must be enabled to capture and reproduce
their audio samples at exact the same time. In other words, every audio
sample has a precise and unique relation to the system time. The system
time and synchronisation accuracy must be much higher than the audio
sampling clock. Additionally, respective clock jitters need to be much
smaller than the audio sampling period. In order to support today's and
future professional production, a synchronicity of 1 µs (see Table
5.8.2.1-1) with respect to the system clock must be met at the
application level of all involved devices (wireless microphones, in-ears
monitors, audio mixing).

In Table 5.8.2.1-1, typical system characteristic parameters of the live
performance use case such as end-to-end delay, system delay, data rates,
reliability, and synchronicity are listed. Not all system parameters
presented in the table are discussed in detail in this document; they
are provided for guidance.

The relation between application latency and end-to-end latency for the
live performance use case is depicted in Figure 5.8.2.1-2. End-to-end
latency is to be understood as the user plane latency between two
terminal devices.

However, it must be taken into account that the audio uplink stream is
supposed to be not identical to the audio downlink stream (e.g., a
monitor mix). Mixing might take place in the MEC cloud or in another UE
connected to the same base station. That implies that the required
end-to-end latency figure depends on the implemented system topology. In
order to achieve an application latency of 4 ms, end-to-end latency for
the communication between UE and the network should be much less than
1 ms.

Furthermore, the application latency in the live performance use case
must be guaranteed for every packet of every audio stream, independently
of the system load, with the specified data rates, and for pre-defined
durations.

audio performance use-case

Finally, the all devices need to be connected to the audio mixing
console that includes also external audio hardware systems and legacy
devices.

#### 5.8.2.2 Pre-conditions

All wireless audio devices on-site (Figure 5.8.1-2) are switched on and
connected to a 5G network.

#### 5.8.2.3 Service flows

A typical service flow in a live performance production network may look
as follows:

1\) A number of wireless audio devices (microphones) capture and process
audio signals, for instance from the artists or music instruments. Each
audio signal is sampled and processed into an isochronous audio stream.

2\) The isochronous audio streams are transmitted wirelessly to the
audio mixing console.

3\) The received audio streams are mixed according to the application
requirements and several audio streams are produced (e.g., for the PA
system and individual IEM mixings for the artists and recording
mixings).

4\) The IEM mixes are transmitted wirelessly as isochronous audio
streams to the corresponding artists.

#### 5.8.2.4 Post-conditions

The live performance devices run as required by the application and
without any perceivable impairments.

#### 5.8.2.5 Challenges to the 5G System

Special challenges to the 5G system associated with this use case
include the following aspects:

\- Very stringent requirements on communication service availability,
PER and end-to-end latency throughout the whole operation time. Here,
end-to-end latency requirements are to be understood not as an average
value for the data stream, but as a limit for every packet of the
stream.

\- Very stringent requirements on clock synchronicity between different
nodes at application level. This implies that the 5G system must support
deterministic packet transfer and ultra-precise time synchronisation,
even in the user equipment. Time-sensitive networking features may be
revealed to the application or equivalent interfaces implemented.

\- Transmission of rather small chunks of data, resulting in potentially
significant overhead due to signalling, local routing, security, etc.

### 5.8.3 Low-latency audio streaming for local conference systems

#### 5.8.3.1 Description

The main task of a conference system is to distribute voice from one
participant to other participants within the same location, e.g., a room
or the conference venue. The service area encompasses the local
conference area; communication services are limited to the service area.
Remote conference systems are not covered here.

In a local conference system, the voice of several speakers is captured
by a conference unit, transmitted to the base station of the Local High
Quality Network (see Figure 5.8.3.1-1), where the mixing of the
different audio streams is done, and then distributed to all other
conference units connected to the local high-quality network. The other
conference units replay the received audio stream. Low end-to-end
latency is pivotal because the speakers always hear themselves speaking.

The main task of a conference system is to distribute voice from one
participant to other participants either within the same location, e.g.,
a room or the conference venue, or to a remote location.

The conference units can be centrally configured and controlled, and
they can start a poll among the participants. The *local conference
system* is described in more details and its typical system parameters
are listed in Table 5.8.3.1-1.Figure 5.8.3.1-1 illustrates the logical
topology of a local conference system. Each conference unit can act as a
transmitter or receiver of an audio stream. The speakers' voices are
transmitted to a conference service application via a central base
station (red arrow) from where the processed audio streams are
distributed again to the other conference units (blue arrows). The
receiving conference units can select between different channels. An
example for such channels are different mixture of the speakers' voices
or their respective language translations. The conference system can be
deployed either in a fixed installation setup or in a moving/portable
setup. In the fixed installation case, the surrounding conditions, e.g.,
the property of the radio channel, are unchanged over a longer period in
time than in the mobile case. In the portable setup case, the conference
system is deployed in an ad-hoc manner. The location and time of
deployment are only known shortly before the conference starts.

final audio streams are distributed to the corresponding conference
units or public address systems.

### 5.8.4 High data rate video streaming / professional video production

#### 5.8.4.1 Description

The use case "high data rate video streaming / professional video
production" addresses demanding applications that partially require
extensive post-processing of the material supplied by cameras. Post
processing increases the quality requirements of the source material,
which entails an increased transmission bandwidth. In particular, scenic
productions (e.g., TV-shows, theatre, award ceremonies, etc.) place high
demands on the communication network - due to their \"quasi-live\"
producing character.

In this use case, high-quality video data is streamed wirelessly from
one or several cameras to the base station of a Local High Quality
Network (see Figure 5.8.4.1-1), where it can be recorded or edited.
Moreover, the video production system allows remote operation of the
cameras (e.g., focus control) by sending and receiving control data. In
general, the operation is limited to a relatively small service area
(see Table 5.8.4.1).

The video stream sent from a camera is used for two purposes:

> As the camera signal for, e.g., \"quasi live\" editing and recording;
>
> For viewing by remote camera operators, e.g., crane operators and
> focus pullers (i.e. to maintain image sharpness of whatever subject or
> action is being filmed).

Currently, several dedicated wireless systems for video and control need
to be used in parallel. This is disadvantageous and potentially can be
improved by the use of 5G RAT as a common enabler.

The professional video production use case is quite demanding, as high
data rate is required in parallel with low latency. Especially, for the
remote lens control application, which is performed by the focus
pullers, low latency is a critical topic. This is because focus tracking
of moving objects based on delayed monitoring or outdated control
commands inevitably results in focusing faults.. Two scenarios are
defined for this use case:

> *Portable, high-data-rate video production system*: The location and
> time of deployment are flexible and can change from one occasion to
> the next. The system is in worldwide use. It is typically shipped in
> flight cases from one location to another. This scenario places major
> requirements on the wireless system, especially to delay, data rate ,
> error behaviour, ease of deployment and dismantling.
>
> *Fixed installation, high-data-rate video production system*: The
> camera part is the same as for the portable scenario. However, the
> base station(s) - including antennas and system wiring - can be
> permanently installed in a typical production studio.

The separation in two scenarios should mainly be considered for a later
product definition with respect to the base station side. The camera
part and the typical requirements for the performance of the wireless
system is the same for both scenarios. The latter are summarised in
Table 5.8.4.1-1.

Professional video systems rely on ultra-precise time synchronisation at
the application level. Each professional video terminal shall
independently refer to an accurate time reference signal that reaches
all terminal devices simultaneously, i.e. within a jitter interval much
smaller than the video sampling period.

#### 5.8.4.2 Pre-conditions

All wireless video devices on-site (see Figure 5.8.4.1-1) are switched
on and connected to a PMSE production network through a local 5G base
station.

#### 5.8.4.3 Service flows

A service flow in a professional video production network may look as
follows:

1\) high-quality video data is streamed wirelessly from one or several
cameras to the professional video production network, where the video
can be recorded or edited;

2\) control data to allow the remote operation of the cameras (e.g.,
focus control) is sent to and from the professional video production
network to the wireless cameras.

#### 5.8.4.4 Post-conditions

The video production devices run as required by the application.

#### 5.8.4.5 Challenges to the 5G System

\- Special challenges to the 5G system associated with this use case
include the following aspects:

\- Very stringent requirements on communication service availability,
packet error ratio and end-to-end latency throughout the whole operation
time.

\- Very stringent requirements on application level clock synchronicity
between different nodes. This implies that the 5G system must support
isochronous packet transfer and ultra-precise time synchronisation, even
in the user equipment. Time-Sensitive Networking features may be
revealed to the application or equivalent interfaces implemented.

\- Professional video systems rely on ultra-precise time synchronisation
at application level and would benefit from IEEE 1588 PTP and
Time-Sensitive Networking-like features.

\- Support of local type-b network deployment with KPIs that meet this
use case\'s requirement.

5.9 Smart farming
-----------------

### 5.9*.*1 Description of vertical

Smart farming is about the application of data gathering (edge
intelligence), data processing, data analysis and automation
technologies within the overall agriculture value chain. One of the
newest trends in agriculture is using the advancement in IoT technology
to make smarter decisions which may lead to reduce farming costs, and
boost production.

This Smart farming is something that is already happening, as
corporations and farm offices collect vast amounts of information from
crop yields, soil-mapping, fertiliser applications, weather data,
machinery, and animal health (e.g., animal health data collected from
sensors are used for monitoring and early detection of events and health
disorders in animals can be prevented \[57\]).

### 5.9.2 Smart farming -- automated irrigation

#### 5.9.2*.*1 Description

This use case describes a typical example of using 5G networks for
supporting smart farming when it comes to data collection and processing
of information. Automated irrigation systems contain valves and sensors
deployed around the farmland, which is centrally controlled and managed
by an information management system. The sensors include temperature,
humidity, illumination, and soil moisture level.

#### 5.9.2.2 Preconditions

Sensors are deployed to monitor agricultural production.

#### 5.9.2.3 Service flows

A farmer deploys a number of sensors in their farm for detecting air
humidity, temperature and soil moisture, and to collect data to irrigate
the farm when needed. The sensors collect data on a regular basis
(pre-defined by farmer), or until certain triggering conditions are met.
The data collected are sent to an information management system via a
secured mobile connection.

The information management system, which can be a 5G device or 5G
network services, stores and processes the data collected from the
sensors

When the soil needs to be irrigated, e.g. the moisture level is low and
humidity is also low compared to what was pre-defined. the information
management system detects the low soil moisture level and low air
humidity from the data collected from the sensor then a trigger is
automatically activated to send control messages to open the water
valve(s) and allow water to irrigate the soil and increase the level of
soil moisture. At the same time an alert is sent to the farmer to report
that the action that has taken place.

When the pre-defined level of soil moisture is reached, the sensor(s)
report(s) this to the information centre and a trigger is activated to
automatically close the water flow.

The management information systems will notify the farmer valve has
closed.

### 5.9.3 Smart farming -- 5G system that enable protection against animal poaching

#### 5.9.3*.*1 Description 

Smart Farming is about the application of data gathering (edge
intelligence), data processing, data analysis and automation
technologies on the overall agriculture value chain. Smart Farming is
strongly related, but not limited, to the concepts of Precision
Agriculture and Precision Livestock Farming. Farming modalities may
include the production of vegetables, cattle (including dairy
production) and others. One of the newest trends in agriculture is using
technology in order to make smarter decisions, reduce costs, and boost
production

This is something that\'s already happening, as corporations and farm
offices collect vast amounts of information from crop yields,
soil-mapping, fertiliser applications, weather data, machinery, and
animal health (e.g in animal health data collected from sensors \[57\]
are used for monitoring and early detection of events and health
disorders in animals can be prevented).

Poaching is a deadly crime against wildlife. According to wildlife
protection officials, legal hunters kill tens of millions of animals
every year, for each of those animals, that are killed illegally,
happens in an enclosed land such as a safari \[65\]. Typical farm range
for Safari is on average about 20km \[58\], and the animals attached in
these enclosed range typically leave orphaned young to starve. Few of
these poachers are caught or punished \[59\].

Although one of the solutions against poaching is to arrest poachers,
however to do this they have to be caught in action, and this is often a
challenge. Although armed personnel are deployed to stop poaching, they
need to be quick to reach and know that the animals are being poached
before they can act, and this, in some cases can be too late. With the
use of a 3GPP network and automated sensor monitoring, it is possible to
quickly detect animals that are being hunted. This will give the rangers
a better opportunity to be proactive rather than reactive.

Typically, data is collected by using sensors attached to the animals'
body, which can capture body temperature, body activity or movement,
pulse rate, and location. The sensor data is sent to a processing
network for analysis, and when an unusual activity is detected an alert
can be sent to the rangers, or drones can immediately be deployed for
further investigation.

The use case describes a typical example of using 3GPP network to
support smart farming and how 3GPP system can help support protection of
animal poaching.

#### 5.9.3.2 Preconditions

Animals with potential for poaching, e.g. elephants, rhinos, are often
situated in controlled areas. These animals are injected with sensors
similar to those used for cattle. Sensors are also buried in the ground
in the controlled area buried in order to detect sounds that are not
animal sound.

#### 5.9.3.3 Service flows

Consider a game reserve that has all animals tagged or injected with
sensors as shown in the picture below (Figure 5.9.3.3-1). These sensors
send data to a processing centre, i.e. an information management centre,
which can either be deployed in a 3GPP network or a 3GPP device.

On a regular basis, sensor data is sent from the animals and from the
sensors in the environment to the information management centre.

If an animal happens to be in distress, the temperature sensor on animal
may indicate an increase in temperature, and sensor pulse data also
indicates an increase in pulse rate.

The sensor data from the environment is also collected, and a
combination of all the information is processed so that a decision can
be made whether to send a drone-based sensor and to take pictures. The
data is processed together with the sound that is being picked up in the
neighbouring ground sensor to detect if it is another animal that is
chasing the distressed animal or it is being chased or chasing another
animal. If this sound indicates that it there is an external threat then
the sensor automatically initiates a drone or ranger to go view the
area. Captured pictures are sent to the information management centre
for processing.

The data collected if it's a drone is also sent to the Information
Management system which is now processed. If the picture taken from the
drone and the sound taken by the drone is analysed then this may trigger
an automatic emergency call to the rangers assuming a ranger was not
initially sent.

resumes.

6 Security
==========

6.1 Particularities of security for automation in vertical domains 
------------------------------------------------------------------

### 6.1.1 Introduction

Security concepts and solutions have mostly been developed for office IT
systems and applications. Security for automation in vertical domains
not only comes with different security priorities, it also comes with
different management & operational characteristics and requirements.
Before discussing the different security requirements in detail, the
following three Clauses present a bird\'s-eye view of the salient
differences between office IT systems and automation systems.

### 6.1.2 Security priorities

Security has the main attributes: confidentiality, integrity, and
availability (availability as in access to the system in question).
While typical office IT prioritises confidentiality over integrity, and
integrity over availability, the complete opposite is true for
automation in many vertical domains (see Figure 6.1.1-1).

height="1.4645833333333333in"}

Figure 6.1.1-1: Difference in security priorities between Office IT and
automation

In other words, availability is the main concern of automation security,
next comes integrity, and confidentiality has generally the lowest
priority.

### 6.1.3 Management and operation characteristics

As shown in Table 6.1.3-1, the management and operation characteristics
of automation and office systems are quite different.

Table 6.1.3-1: Automation and office IT systems have different
management & operation characteristics

                                      **Automation systems**                                                 **Office IT systems**
  ----------------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  *Target for security protection*    Automation resources including logistics                               IT infrastructure including personal, computers, etc.
  *Required availability*             Very high                                                              Medium; delays acceptable
  *Component lifetime*                Up to 20 years                                                         3-5 years
  *Required real-time behaviour*      Can be critical                                                        Delays acceptable
  *Physical security*                 Varying                                                                High for data centres
  *Application of security patches*   Slow; restricted by regulation                                         Regular/scheduled
  *Anti-virus programs*               Uncommon; hard to deploy; application whitelisting as an alternative   Common and widely used
  *Security testing and auditing*     Increasing prevalence                                                  Scheduled and mandated for critical infrastructure such as IT service centres

Automation systems put not only an emphasis on availability, but this
availability has to be guaranteed over typically 5-7 times longer
component lifetimes than used in IT. Real-time behaviour of automation
systems can be critical (especially for control applications). Another
big difference is the security \"culture\". Security patches are applied
rather slowly in automation, in particular due to regulatory
limitations. Also, in many installations, patches can be installed only
during scheduled maintenance windows of the automation system.
Anti-virus programmes are rather uncommon in automation, as the virus
patterns would have to be updated regularly. Instead, application
whitelisting may be used for ensuring that only authorised, unmodified
applications can be executed. While security testing and auditing is the
norm for critical IT infrastructure such as service centres, these
assurance approaches are still evolving for automation in vertical
domains. A reason for this lag is that the reliable operation of the
automation system must not be endangered by penetration tests.

### 6.1.4 Security requirements -- an overview

A high-level comparison of security requirements of automation and
office IT systems is shown in Table 6.1.4-1.

Table 6.1.4-1: Automation and office IT systems have different security
requirements

                                                                                    **Automation systems**                                                                                                                                                   **Office IT systems**

  *Non-repudiation*                                                                 Medium to high (depending on vertical)                                                                                                                                   Medium
  NOTE: For a definition of system availability and reliability see Clause 4.3.3.                                                                                                                                                                            

Security standards are well developed for office IT systems, but have
been under development for automation systems in vertical domains. In
particular, the industrial security standard IEC62443 is increasingly
adopted in many vertical domains.

While the importance of confidentiality is generally high in office
environments, it is rather low to medium for physically
access-restricted automation system such as production cells in a
factory. However, confidentiality has to be protected for
business-relevant know-how, e.g., for engineering data or for process
parameters of a chemical production process. Integrity is paramount and,
as already eluded to in Clause 6.1.2, availability and reliability are
of paramount importance. Non-repudiation may be high for automation
systems, where the correct operation of the production has to be
asserted, e.g., in pharmaceutical production, while it is typically
medium for office environments.

6.2 Industrial-security responsibilities
----------------------------------------

In vertical use cases, security is, in general, a shared responsibility
between a product supplier (typically the product manufacturer), the
integrator, and the operator of the infrastructure in question.
Hereafter, the latter is also referred to as infrastructure operator.

Let us illustrate these roles for an electric-power distribution grid
use case, i.e. the automation of an electric-power distribution grid
(see Figure 6.2-1). In this case, the infrastructure operator in
question is a utility, and the integrator is typically the company
installing the hardware. The OT infrastructure in question is the energy
automation equipment for operating the digital grid. Note that the
infrastructure operator is responsible for both the IT and OT
installation. In the case of electric-power distribution grid, an
example for OT is an adjustable transformer, and an example for IT is
consumer and prosumer billing software. The integrator can be the
utility itself or a sub-contracted company. We emphasise the role as an
OT infrastructure operator in Figure 6.2-1, since the OT infrastructure
is controlling the physical world, which makes use cases in this study
different from pure IT use cases such as multi-player gaming. In the
case of automation equipment utilising a 5G network, the suppliers
include both the supplier of the electric-power distribution grid
automation equipment and the suppliers of the 5G equipment.

To address cyber security needs of the infrastructure operator, these
actors rely on adequate processes for handling IT security as well as on
technical and procedural security means. These actors thus require
sufficiently secure products but also a secure integration of products
into systems and solutions.

![](media/image52.emf)

Figure 6.2-1: Distribution of security responsibilities for the example
of an electric-power distribution grid

Starting from the left side of Figure 6.2-1, all participants, i.e.
infrastructure operator, system integrator, and product supplier,
operate an infrastructure that needs to be managed according to the
associated risks. As noted for the infrastructure operator in Figure
6.2-1, this is specifically enforced through directives, e.g., the NIS
directive for critical infrastructures in Europe.

Risks regarding the operation of an IT infrastructure are typically
addressed with an information security management system. The ISO 27000
series defines a generalised information security management system by
specifying operational processes and procedures addressing security.
This framework also provides specific guidance on certain vertical
domains. Figure 6.2-1shows the example of an electric-power distribution
grid (a.k.a. Smart Grid), for which ISO 27019 provides an augmentation
of the general security controls described in ISO 27002 for the power
system domain.

Many of the aforementioned processes require interfaces, which come with
requirements for the integrator and the device or system manufacturer.
The integrator defines security requirements based on the intended
operational use cases and determines security levels to be achieved. One
standard supporting this is IEC 62443-3-3 \[42\] (see Clause 6.3).
Thanks to the definition of a target security level, which leaves the
actual technical realisation open, the manufacturer can choose among
various options for the implementation. As shown in Figure 6.2-1, the
product supplier typically builds products according to established
security standards. For instance, for communication security, the
product supplier can employ IEC 62351, which is a domain-specific
security standard series for the power system domain. This series,
beyond other specifications, profiles already existing security
standards like TLS for securing TCP/IP based communication. 5G security
features can also be leveraged here for supporting secure network
access.

In praxis, different deployments (based on equipment from different
automation suppliers) often use different kinds of credentials. Also, it
is noteworthy that automation devices often have different communication
ports (e.g., WLAN and Ethernet), and that authentication of the device
is done with the same credential, irrespective of the port used. In this
context it is also important to remember that the security mechanisms
used need to be supported for at least the life expectancy of the
installed devices. This life expectancy is typically ten years or more.
So, if 5G UEs etc. are installed in, for instance, a factory, the 5G
system and future updates of the system have to support the initially
used authentication mechanism for the same time span. Furthermore, it is
worth mentioning that there is a pervasive trend toward EAP as a common
authentication framework in non-3GPP communication technologies for
verticals.

6.3 Background: the industrial security standard IEC 62443
----------------------------------------------------------

5G security is essential for low-latency high-reliability communication
applied to automation, e.g., in industrial automation, Industry 4. 0,
industrial IoT, building automation, and the electric-power distribution
grid. The industrial security standard IEC 62443 \[40\] is applied in
various vertical domains, including factory automation, process
automation, building automation, transportation systems, and energy
management. Compatibility of 5G security solutions with IEC 62443 is
important so that 5G offerings can be used flexibly in different
industrial domains.

The international industrial security standard IEC 62443 is a security
framework defined by the International Electrotechnical Commission
(IEC). It covers both organisational and technical aspects of security,
without being prescriptive regarding the technical solution. In the set
of corresponding documents, security requirements are defined, which
target the solution operator and the integrator, but also the product
vendor.

As shown in Figure 6.3-1, the parts of the standard are grouped into
four clusters covering

> \- common definitions and metrics;
>
> \- requirements concerning setup of a security organisation (related
> to information security management systems), solution suppliers, and
> service provider processes;
>
> \- technical requirements and methodology for security at a
> system-wide level;
>
> \- requirements concerning the security development lifecycle of
> system components, and security requirements for such components at a
> technical level.

According to the methodology described in IEC 62443-3-2 \[41\], a
complex automation system is structured into zones that are connected by
and communicate through so-called \"conduits\" that map, for example, to
the logical network communication between two zones. Moreover, IEC
62443-3-3 defines security levels (SL) that correlate with the strength
of a potential adversary as shown in Figure 6.3-2 below \[42\].

height="2.154861111111111in"}

Figure 6.3-2: Security levels according to IEC 62443-3-3 \[42\]

In order to reach a dedicated SL, the related requirements have to be
fulfilled. For each security level, IEC 62443-3-3 defines a set of
security requirements for an automation system. Seven foundational
requirements group specific requirements:

> \- FR 1: identification and authentication control;
>
> \- FR 2: use control;
>
> \- FR 3: system integrity;
>
> \- FR 4: data confidentiality;
>
> \- FR 5: restricted data flow;
>
> \- FR 6 timely response to events;
>
> \- FR 7: resource availability.

For each of the foundational requirements, there exist several concrete
technical security requirements (SR) and further requirement
enhancements (RE) that have to be fulfilled for a specific security
level. In the context of communication security, the security levels are
specifically interesting for the conduits connecting different zones.
The following examples are taken from IEC 62443-3-3 \[42\] to illustrate
some of the requirements.

> \- FR1 SR 1.6 -- Wireless access management: The control system shall
> provide the capability to identify and authenticate all users (humans,
> software processes or devices) engaged in wireless communication.
>
> \- FR3, SR3.1 -- Communication integrity: \"The control system shall
> provide the capability to protect the integrity of transmitted
> information\".
>
> \- FR3, SR3.8 -- Session integrity: \"The control system shall provide
> the capability to protect the integrity of sessions. The control
> system shall reject any usage of invalid session IDs.\"
>
> \- FR4, SR 4.1, RE 1 -- Protection of confidentiality at rest or in
> transit via untrusted networks: \"The control system shall provide the
> capability to protect the confidentiality of information at rest and
> remote access sessions traversing an untrusted network.\"
>
> \- FR5, SR 5.2 -- Zone boundary protection: \"The control system shall
> provide the capability to monitor and control communications at zone
> boundaries to enforce the compartmentalisation defined in the
> risk-based zones and conduits model.\"

As IEC 62443 gains more acceptance in different industry domains,
different technical security solutions suitable for the application
domain and coping with the security requirements are needed.

6.4 5G security for automation applications
-------------------------------------------

### 6.4.1 Introduction

Depending on how 5G networks and 5G technologies are used by a vertical
automation application, different requirements have to be met by the
underlying 5G security solutions. Clause 6.4.2 addresses pertinent
quality properties of the security solution, and Clause 6.4.3 provides
potential requirements that were---among others---inferred from IEC
62443 \[42\] and from an application-centric study \[43\].

### 6.4.2 Quality properties of 5G security solutions

*Authentication of communication peers and the 5G system:* In many
vertical use cases, security responsibilities are complex, as they are
shared by several actors and need to be managed by credential pairs or
certificates from different sources. Authentication and verification
purposes are increasingly achieved using the EAP framework. Related
potential requirements can be found in Clause 5.3.19.6.

*Flexible subscriber access management:* Efficient management of 5G
subscriptions/permissions is important for small, medium and huge
numbers of 5G UEs that provide communication among automation system
entities (e.g., machinery on a factory floor). In this context,
\"small\" is on the order of 10, and \"huge\" on the order of 10.000 or
larger. In this context, management stands for adding UEs to a 5G
subscription so that they can use 5G communication services, but also
for removing UEs from the subscription base. One of the challenges here
is medium-sized installations, where manual management is not practical,
while fully automated solutions that require a complex infrastructure
may be too cumbersome.\
Subscriber access management may involve action on the UE side, e.g.,
installation, or activation of pre-installed security credentials in the
UE; as well as action at the network side, e.g., enabling network access
to these UEs on the factory floor.

*Long-term security:* Devices in many verticals operate over long usage
periods (in industrial environments typically 10 to 20 years), which
makes long-term security an important topic. Note that in many vertical
environments updates may be installed only during planned service
windows. Note that such updates may imply that a laborious safety
recertification has to be repeated, which generally is avoided.

It is important that an automation application system can be kept in
service over a long usage period without requiring regular physical
access to the devices for upgrades (e.g., replacing hardware components;
redesigning the technical solution). However, it is also critical for
the distributed automation application that UEs are upgradable or can be
patched (including firmware, security-related algorithms and long-term
keys) in order to maintain the security of the system to the
state-of-the art over the life span of the devices. For a related
discussion see the note 3 in the requirement Factories of the Future
19.6 (Clause 5.3.19.6).

*5G as communication infrastructure:* When the security provided by the
communication system is deemed to be insufficient for a vertical
automation application, security of the industrial solution is realised
on top (e.g., using IPsec or TLS). A non-automation example for this is
online banking. In many deployments, the 5G network is expected to
provide certain dependability guarantees independently of security.
Communication dependability is discussed in detail in Clause 4.3.3.

NOTE 1: As discussed in Clause 6.1.3, security and other patches/updates
may often only be installed during the maintenance window of the
automation system. For typical automation systems this window occurs
once a year and lasts about one week, during which the automation system
can be physically accessed.

Also---for automation traffic requiring QoS---it is important that the
required QoS can be provided irrespective of whether over-the-top (OTT)
security is used.

NOTE 2: Since the 5G system is not in control of the automation
application\'s security-related data flows, the aforementioned required
communication service dependability and QoS can perhaps not be met due
to high communication resource consumption. In this case, the automation
application, including its security functions, would need to be
optimised in order to lower the communication resource consumption and
to thus increase the communication service dependability.

NOTE 3: If security for automation is only ensured by OTT security, the
possible usages of 5G in vertical applications is limited (e.g., reduced
lifetime of battery-powered devices, limited real-time capability).

*Reliance on 5G security alone:* 5G systems may be used for connecting
IoT devices. In such deployments, realising security on top of 5G could
reduce the life time of battery-powered IoT devices, or deteriorate
experienced dependability parameters (see above). Therefore, it may be
decided to rely on 5G communication security alone. If that is the case,
the vertical automation applications need to verify that the required 5G
security mechanisms are actually active.

*Message integrity:* As outlined in Clause 6.1.2, integrity within
automation systems---and thus information integrity and communication
integrity---are of high importance, even if no encryption is in place.
Current encryption mechanisms like authenticated encryption for
protecting confidentiality typically also come with integrity protection
mechanisms. However, when encryption mechanisms are not activated,
communication integrity might not be protected. One motivation for not
activating encryption may be to reduce the end-to-end latency of a 5G
system when additional over-the-top security is in place. Another
motivation is that encryption of telecommunication may not be permitted
in certain countries.

### 6.4.3 Potential security requirements

essential for automation in vertical domains in addition to the
potential requirements in Clause 5.3.19.6.

7. Deployment for automation in vertical domains
================================================

7.1 5G deployment options
-------------------------

The present TR describes use cases for deployment of 5G technology in a
wide range of locations. Application areas broadly range from
transportation including railways, to shipping/logistics, factories of
the future, massive sensor networks, augmented reality, program making,
fleet maintenance, smart grid, and smart cities.

New deployment options support some of these application areas. For
example, private deployments may serve factories and other specific
places.

In order to ensure the requirements for availability and reliability can
be met, various deployment options can be utilised. Restricting access
to resources to only those entities belonging to the enterprise, or even
a subset of them, can ensure that specific capabilities are available
when needed. For example, in an automated factory, radio and network
resources supporting specific KPIs for reliability and latency may be
restricted for access only by the robotic controls requiring the
specific KPIs. This eliminates competition for those resources by other
UEs that do not have the same reliability and latency requirements.
Similarly, restricting access to enterprise resources by only authorised
UEs eliminates churn from unauthorised UEs (e.g., a person with a cell
phone walking past the factory) attempting access to resources they will
not be able to use.

3GPP supports a range of deployment scenarios based around macro cells
and small cells and 5G is expected to extend the supported topologies
whilst supporting both macro and small cell deployments. Specifically,
short wavelength spectrum such as mm-wave is likely to trigger new types
of cell deployment due to its radio characteristics. 3GPP also has a
host of other deployment tools such as LAA, Dedicated Core Networks,
IOPS, etc. which can offer a great number of deployment options. What is
key, is matching the appropriate network deployment to the required use
case or scenario.

As discussed in the present document, 5G communication for automation in
vertical domains requires high levels of availability, reliability, and
maintainability in order to ensure high levels of service accessibility
and productivity. To meet specific end user requirements, specific
network deployments and parameters may be utilised. For example, a
sub-surface mining operation and associated surface support have very
different levels of existing deployment & coverage, propagation
environment, existing deployed communication infrastructure, and
required services in comparison to a nationwide electricity grid with
communication services deployed via public WWAN.

  NOTE 1: The jitter interval is symmetric. However, only late arrivals count as communication error.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   

NOTE 2: The time parameters and the message size in row two and three
are to be read as follows. First, a transfer interval value that lies
within the provided interval is chosen. Then the end-to-end latency and
the survival time are inferred. For instance, one chooses 10 ms in row
four. In this case the survival time is also 10 ms, and the end-to-end
latency is smaller than 10 ms and the jitter is 5 ms. Next, the message
size is chosen; for instance, 250 kbyte.

8A Considerations on Communication Service

8A.1 Overview

*This clause provides guidelines and considerations for the definition
of the communication service interface. More detailed information can be
found in Annex H.*

*The requirements on communication in 5G networks can be classified
under real-time and non-real-time requirements, safety requirements, and
integrity requirements. Real-time and non-real time requirements may be
deterministic or non-deterministic.*

*Descriptive parameters (Dsp) describe the inherent attributes of the
application. Examples are application relation (AR) and communication
relation (CR), transfer interval, message size, and send time.*

*Quality of Service parameters (Qosp) describe the requirements of the
communication service relative to measurable parameters. Examples are
end-to-end latency, communication service availability, communication
service reliability, update time, and survival time.*

*Security parameters (Scp) describe the security requirements such as
validation, authentication, and authorization.*

*Safety parameters (Sfp) describe parameters of the application that are
required to meet safety concerns.*

8A.2 General format of communication service interface (CSIF)

*CSIF\_{( input block), (output block)}*

*The interface should describe an objective, service identification,
service reference points, and a description pertaining to clause 8A.1.*

*The input block defines the service request from the application or
user perspective. The output block describes the service request
acknowledgement and additional information pertaining to the
communication service from the provider perspective. The format of the
output block depends on the objective of the communication service
interface and the provided input block.*

8A.3 Objectives and candidate parameters of communication service
interface

*A communication service interface defines a set of mandatory and
optional parameters:*

-   *Mandatory: request objective (e.g. disengagement, setup,
    modification, and monitoring), identification, authorization and
    authentication, status.*

-   *Optional: the extent of specification of optional parameters may
    depend on the communication service request objective. The optional
    artifacts may only apply in the context of the application
    requirements relating to descriptive, safety, and QoS parameters.*

*The objective Communication Service Setup triggers the configuration or
provisioning of a new communication service.*

*The objective Communication Service Modification triggers a change to
an existing communication service.*

*The objective Communication Service Disengagement triggers a tear down
of an existing communication service.*

*The objective Communication Service Monitoring triggers a query for
statistical information on an existing communication service.*

8A.4 Potential requirements on communication service interface

*The 5G system shall provide a communication service interface that
contains an input block and an output block as functional blocks.*

*The 5G system shall provide a communication service interface that
consists of mandatory and optional artifacts.*

*The 5G system shall enable different objectives for the communication
service interface: setup, modification, disengagement, and monitoring.*

This technical report identifies potential requirements that were not
taken into account when service and performance requirements were
identified in 3GPP TS 22.261 \[3\]. Examples for this are requirements
for periodic communication services with very tight time bounds (see,
for instance, Clause 5.3.2), clock synchronisation (see, for instance
Clause 5.8.2), and requirements for user-centric communication service
monitoring (see Clause 5.3.21).

The present document also provides an overview of automation concepts
and how communication for automation is modelled in the vertical domains
(clause 4).

Additionally, the document provides an overview of security needs for
communication in vertical domains, illustrates existing security
mechanisms in these domains, and identifies potential related 5G
security requirements (clause 6).

Furthermore, the present document also discusses deployment options.

The consolidated potential requirements in Clause 8 are candidates for
normative R16 requirements.

#########  Annex A: Characteristic parameters and influence quantities

A.1 Transmission time
=====================

The transmission time is a fundamental characteristic parameter which
can be used for the assessment of the availability and real-time
capability of a wireless system. In this context, it is of interest to
know how long the transmission of user data from the source (e.g. a
sensor) to the target (e.g. a controller) takes. A consistent
understanding of this period of time requires precise stipulation of the
start and end of measurement. The transmission time is the period from
transferring the first discrete component of the application message
(e.g., bit or octet) to the interface between application and wireless
communication of a source and the handover of the last discrete
component of the same user data from the interface between the wireless
communication and application of a target (see Figure A.1-1). The type
of the interface between wireless communication and application is
always to be stated together with the characteristic parameter values.

height="3.9520833333333334in"}

Figure A.1-1: Definition of the transmission time

As shown in Figure A.1-1, the values for transmission time fluctuate,
for instance because retransmission is needed. The transmission time
cannot fall below a certain minimum, but it typically scatters around a
value close to that minimum. The value which occurs most frequent, i.e.
the modal value, is usually better suited than the mean value as a
measure of tendency for the transmission time. What is a sensible spread
parameter for the transmission time depends on the use case and
implementation. An example spread parameter is percentile P95, i.e. the
maximum value for 95% of all transmissions.

A.2 Up time, down time and up state, down state
===============================================

The assessment of communication is referring to message transmission.
Message transmission ratings can be *correctly received*, *incorrectly
received*, or *lost*. A lost message is a message which left the source
application and never reached the target application.

Up time and down time can be derived from the introduced types of
messages. As far as timely received messages are correct, the
communication is in *up state*. The time interval of this state
experienced by the target device is called *up time* or *up time
interval*. If a message loss or an incorrectly received message is
detected the communication is in *down state*. The time interval of this
state experienced by the target device is called *down time* or *down
time interval*. Alternatively, the terms *available* and *unavailable*
may be used. This behaviour is illustrated in Figure A.2-1.

![](media/image72.emf){width="6.606944444444444in"
height="4.785416666666666in"}

Figure A.2-1: Definition of up time, down time and up state, down state,
also showing survival time

The flow of events in Figure A.2-1 is as follows. The network is up and
running (blue line indicates up state). A source device starts sending
messages to a target device (orange arrows), on which an automation
function (application) is running. The communication service is, from
the point of view of the target application, in an up state (green line
is on UP). The up/down state of the application is based on correctly
received messages. Note that the up time interval of the application
starts later than the up state of the network, i.e. with the receipt of
the first message from the source device. The network transitions into
down state if it no longer can support end-to-end transmission of the
source device\'s messages to the target device according to the
negotiated communication QoS. Once the application on the target device
senses the absence of expected messages (\"Deadline for expected
message\" in Figure A.2.-1), it will wait a pre-set period before it
considers the communication service to be unavailable (\"Deadline for
message reception\" in Figure A.2-1). This is the so-called survival
time \[3\]. The survival time can be expressed as a period of time or,
especially with cyclic traffic, as maximum number of consecutive
incorrectly received or lost messages. If the survival time has been
exceeded, the application transitions the status of the communication
service into a down state (green line of application changes to DOWN in
Figure A.2-1). The application will usually take corresponding actions
for handling such situations of unavailable communication services. For
instance, it will commence an emergency shutdown. Notice that this does
not imply that the target application is shut off; rather it transitions
into a pre-defined state, e.g. a safe state. As a general rule, the
target application still \"listens\" to incoming packets or may try to
send messages to the source application. Once the network/communication
service is in the up state again (blue line in Figure A.2-1 changes to
UP), the communication service state as perceived by the target
application will change to the up state. The communication service is
thus again perceived as available (green line of communication service
changes to UP in Figure A.2-1) as soon as a message is correctly
received by the application at the target device. The state of the
application, however, depends on the counter measures taken by the
application. The application might stay in down state if it is in a safe
state due to an emergency shutdown. Or, the application may do a
recovery and change to up state again.

Note that it is the down time interval of the communication service as
experienced by the application that will be used to calculate the
availability of the communication service. For instance, in case the
communication service is expected to run for a time *T*, the
unavailability *U* of the communication service can be calculated as

$$U = \frac{\sum_{i}^{}{\mathrm{\Delta}t}_{i}}{T}$$

Where Δ*t~i~* is the length of the *i*-th downtime interval within the
time period *T.* The communication service availability *A* can then be
calculated as *A = *1--*U.*

Up state and down state and the corresponding up time interval and down
time interval are also available at the source device. However, they are
experienced a little differently with respect to the points in time as
illustrated in Figure A.2-1.

A.3 Jitter -- characterisation of timeliness
============================================

Time requirements are typically specified with two values:
characteristic time and jitter.

**Characteristic time:** is the target value of the time parameter in
question, e.g. end-to-end latency.

**Jitter**: The jitter is the variation of a (characteristic) time
parameter. An example is the variation of the end-to-end to latency. If
not stated otherwise, jitter specifies the symmetric value range around
the target value (target value ± jitter/2). If the actual time value is
outside this interval, the transmission was not successful. Figure A.3-1
shows an example of transmissions with jitter. Note that the end-to-end
latency may scatter even for successful transmissions.

![](media/image73.emf){width="6.690277777777778in"
height="6.738194444444445in"}

Figure A.3-1: End-to-end latency and end-to-end latency jitter

Typical characteristic parameters to which jitter values are ascribed
are

> \- transfer interval;
>
> \- end-to-end latency;
>
> \- update time.

Note, that jitter is not always explicitly stated in technical
documents. In such a case, the maximum value of the characteristic time
parameter needs to be known. Sometimes, also a minimum value may be
given. This time should not be undershot. A minimum value is only used
in particular use cases, for instance, when putting labels at a specific
location on moving objects.

A.4 Periodicity - cycle time, transfer interval, and update time
================================================================

In industrial automation applications, sensor data is in many cases
gathered periodically. Accordingly, actuator data is provided
periodically, too. Therefore, the transmission of this data via
communication networks is in most cases also periodic.

NOTE: Periodic communication is usually continuous. After the related
automation functions are activated---e.g. controlling, sensing, and
actuating---periodic data transmission continuous until these functions
are stopped. In extreme cases, continuous operation can extend over a
calendar year or more.

Event driven data transmission might be also used. In this case,
additional periodic control messages are introduced for dependability
reasons. These are called heart beat messages or keep alive messages.

The periodic processes within industrial automation applications are
often called *cycle* and the related interval *cycle time*.
Unfortunately, the term cycle has different meanings depending on the
point of view. With respect to the periodic communication, it is better
to use the communication-related terms transfer interval and update time
instead of cycle time.

Periodic communication means that a transmission is repeated. For
example, a transmission occurs every 15 ms. Reasons for a periodical
transmission can be the periodic update of a position or the repeated
sensing or monitoring of a characteristic parameter. Although a
transmission of a temperature every 15 minutes is a periodical
transmission, too, most periodic transfer intervals in communication for
automation are rather short. The user experienced data rate of periodic
communication of fixed message sizes is the message size divided by the
transfer interval. For instance, for a message size of 40 byte and a
transfer interval of 1 ms, the user experienced data rate is 40 byte/1
ms = 320 kb/s.

The *update time* is the equivalent of the transfer interval at the
receiver. A periodic transmission is started once and continuous unless
a stop command is provided. Figure A.4-1 illustrates transfer interval
and update time.

height="7.428472222222222in"}

Figure A.4-1 -- Transfer interval and update time of periodic
communication

NOTE: the update time may experience jitter. This can be caused by
varying waiting times until the actual transmission, for instance,
varying waiting times for the assigned timeslots in TDMA superframes.
This has to be taken into account when requirements are specified and
for the assurance of quality of service.

#########  Annex B: Communication errors

B.1 Introduction
================

IEC 61784-3-3 describes fundamental communication errors which can be
identified for applications with functional safety requirements \[25\].
The description of these communication errors refers to field buses.
These errors may however also occur in other communication systems.

B.2 Corruption
==============

Messages may be corrupted due to errors within a bus participant, due to
errors on the transmission medium, or due to message interference.

> NOTE 1: Message error during transfer is a normal event for any
> standard communication system; such events are detected with high
> probability at receivers by use of a hash function.
>
> NOTE 2: Most communication systems include protocols for recovery from
> transmission errors, so these messages will not be classed as \'loss\'
> until recovery or repetition procedures have failed or are not used.
>
> NOTE 3: If the recovery or repetition procedures take longer than a
> specified deadline, a message is classed as \'unacceptable delay\'.
>
> NOTE 4: In the very low probability event that multiple errors result
> in a new message with correct message structure (for example
> addressing, length, hash function such as CRC, etc.), the message will
> be accepted and processed further. Evaluations based on a message
> sequence number or a time stamp can result in fault classifications
> such as unintended repetition, incorrect sequence, unacceptable delay,
> insertion \[25\].

B.3 Unintended repetition
=========================

Due to an error, fault, or interference, not updated messages are
repeated at an incorrect point in time.

NOTE 1: Repetition by the sender is a normal procedure when an expected
acknowledgment/response is not received from a target station, or when a
receiver detects a missing message and asks for it to be resent.

In some cases, the lack of response can be detected, and the message
repeated with minimal delay and no loss of sequence, in other cases the
repetition occurs at a later time and arrives out of sequence with other
messages.

NOTE 2: Some field buses use redundancy to send the same message
multiple times or via multiple alternate routes to increase the
probability of good reception \[25\].

B.4 Incorrect sequence
======================

Due to an error, fault, or interference, the predefined sequence (for
example natural numbers, time references) associated with messages from
a particular source is incorrect.

NOTE 1: Field bus systems can contain elements that store messages (for
example FIFOs in switches, bridges, routers) or use protocols that can
alter the sequence (for example by allowing messages with high priority
to overtake those with lower priority).

NOTE 2: When multiple sequences are active, such as messages from
different source entities or reports relating to different object types,
these sequences are monitored separately, and errors can be reported for
each sequence \[25\].

B.5 Loss
========

Due to an error, fault, or interference, a message or acknowledgment is
not received \[25\].

B.6 Unacceptable delay
======================

Messages may be delayed beyond their permitted arrival time window, for
example due to errors in the transmission medium, congested transmission
lines, interference, or due to bus participants sending messages in such
a manner that services are delayed or denied (for example FIFOs in
switches, bridges, routers).

NOTE: In underlying field buses using scheduled or cyclic scans, message
errors can be recovered in the following ways:

> a\) immediate repetition;
>
> b\) repetition using spare time at the end of the cycle;
>
> c\) treating the message as lost and waiting for the next cycle to
> receive the next value.
>
> In case (a), all the following messages in that cycle are slightly

B.7 Masquerade
==============

Due to a fault or interference, a message is inserted that relates to an
apparently valid source entity, so a non-safety related message may be
received by a safety-related participant, which then treats it as safety
related.

NOTE: Communication systems used for safety-related applications can use
additional checks to detect masquerade, such as authorised source
identities and pass-phrases or cryptography \[25\].

B.8 Insertion
=============

Due to a fault or interference, a message is received that relates to an
unexpected or unknown source entity.

NOTE: These messages are additional to the expected message stream, and
because they do not have expected sources, they cannot be classified as
correct, unintended repetition, or incorrect sequence \[25\].

B.9 Addressing
==============

Due to a fault or interference, a safety-related message is delivered to
the incorrect safety related participant, which then treats reception as
correct \[25\].

#########  Annex C: Communication system errors

C.1 Hardware errors
===================

Hardware errors encompass the failure or disturbance of the function of
electrical, electronic and programmable components. They are caused by
physical and chemical processes which take place in the environment or
in the system. If the function of a component no longer meets the
specification, it is---as a rule---assessed as unusable and therefore as
failed.

Depending on the cause, the scope and the speed of occurrence,
distinctions are made between:

> \- random failure and deterministic failure;
>
> \- total failure and partial failure;
>
> \- sudden failure and degradation failure, and fatigue failure;
>
> \- hardware errors (may, for example, be caused by poor workmanship);
>
> \- components of sub-standard quality,
>
> \- ageing;
>
> \- overloading (e.g. clock frequency, voltage or current);
>
> \- high or low temperatures;
>
> \- frequent temperature changes;
>
> \- impacts, acceleration, or vibration;
>
> \- electrical, magnetic, or electromagnetic fields;
>
> \- ionising radiation.

C.2 Software errors or program errors
=====================================

Software errors or program errors encompass the malfunction of computer
programs. Distinctions are made between the following kinds of software
error:

> Syntax errors: infringements of the grammatical rules of the
> programming language used. A syntax error prevents compilation of the
> defective program.
>
> \- Run time errors: designates all kinds of errors which occur during
> run time; example: exceeding the value range or incorrect data types
> for variables on input, when there is no verification or an incorrect
> version of the operating system.
>
> \- Logical errors: occur due to an incorrect entry or incorrect
> algorithm.
>
> \- Design errors: are errors in the basic concept which are caused by
> the assumption of incorrect requirements or defective software design.
>
> \- Errors as a consequence of physical operating conditions:
> electromagnetic fields, radiation, mechanical stresses, temperature
> fluctuations, etc. can lead to errors even in systems that are working
> within the specification.

Considerations of software and hardware errors can be found, for
example, in IEC 62439 \[26\], which also deals with concepts of
redundancy in industrial Ethernet networks, or in IEC 62673 \[24\], in
which a general methodology for dependability assessment and assurance
in communication networks throughout their life cycles is described.

C.3 Physical link errors
========================

In wireless transmission, the physical link presents a special
challenge. The environment in which it is used has a great influence on
the dependability parameters. A distinction is made between passive
influences (where the signal transmitted is influenced on the way to the
target) and active influences (where additional signals impair
recognition of the useful signal at the target). The passive influences
include the distance (distance-related attenuation of the signal),
metallic obstacles (reflection, diffraction and refraction of the
signal), dielectric obstacles (attenuation of the signal) and heavy rain
or fog (absorption of the signal). Active influences result from the
transmission of electromagnetic waves in the vicinity of the
communication devices. The passive and active influences are referred to
as disturbances. These disturbances have an effect on the physical link
and can be the cause of transmission errors.

#########  Annex D: Plug and produce (steps c to e)

The text below augments the set of hot-plugging steps described in
Clause 5.3.19.3.

**C. Establishment of information communication of the automation
application via an application protocol**

This step includes the establishment of a connection to the automation
network by use of an application protocol, e.g. OPC UA. The sub-steps
use the communication network via the application protocol and are
independent of the underlying communication technology (5G, WLAN, etc.).

######### Annex E: Characteristic parameters for the calculation of the required communication capacity in a flexible, modular production area 

This Annex provides a quantity structure for calculating the required
communication capacity in a flexible, modular production area. The
characteristic parameters were inferred from production areas in car
manufacturing. The particular lifecycle phase addressed is engineering
and commissioning of a flexible, modular production area. Based on Table
E-1 and E-2, a rough estimate of required wireless resources can be
inferred. This calculation is contingent on the layout of the respective
production hall (fixed assets, obstructions...). The areas in the
production hall are divided into operation areas (e.g., assembly
stations) and logistic areas. Some of these areas may overlap. The
horizontal hall dimension of a car production, for instance, is
typically 400 m x 250 m and less. The hall is typically divided in a
process area and a two times smaller logistic area. This description is
generic and independent of the communication technology used.

#########  Annex H: Considerations on communication service interface 

H.1 Overview
------------

*This section classifies requirements of industrial applications
necessary for 5G communication services and provides further
classification of the requirements for different types of communications
services.*

*It also provides considerations for the definition of communication
service interfaces.*

H.2 Classification of application requirements 
----------------------------------------------

*Industrial networks support a wide range of automation functions
(applications) with various requirements on communication. These
requirements are mostly use-case centric. Regardless, there exist
general requirements on communication which may differ in the absolute
threshold values of the measured parameters but not necessarily the
parameters themselves.*

*The requirements on communication can be classified under four themes:*

*Real-time requirements*

*Non-real-time requirements*

*Safety requirements*

*Integrity requirement*

*Real-time and Non-real-time requirements are communication requirements
based on timeliness of delivery of messages or data between interacting
applications through the 5G network.*

*Safety requirements are centred on normal operation of the industrial
application such that failure in communication does not results in
endangerment of neither the user nor result in financial loss
(catastrophic situations). These requirements are mostly focused around
dependability requirements of the communication services and the 5G
network. This requirement defines the ability of the communication
service to perform as and when required. The dependability requirements
subsume communication service availability, reliability and
maintainability requirements described in \[7\].*

*Integrity requirements focus on the ability of the communication
service or network to ensure that information sent via the network stays
uncorrupted. This also falls partly under network security and
dependability requirements.*

*Under the theme real-time and non-real time, the communication is
classified into deterministic and non-deterministic communication
classes.*

*The deterministic class represents requirements on traffic with strict
measure on predictable service outcomes on transmission of messages
whether periodic or a-periodic. If a requirement is deterministic and at
the same time periodic, the requirement is called a deterministic
periodic requirement. Likewise, a-periodic requirements are called
deterministic a-periodic requirements. A real-time deterministic
requirement therefore subsumes all periodic and non-periodic
requirements that specify stringent and predictable bounds on the QoS
measurements of the timeliness of the transmissions.*

*On the other hand, the non-deterministic class subsumes all other types
of requirements that do not specify predictable bounds on the QoS
measurements of timeliness of the transmissions.*

*The timeliness parameter should consider end-to-end latency (lateness
or earliness).*

### H.2.1 Characteristic parameters for identification of requirement classes

*The class of deterministic requirements maintains a constant bound on
descriptive parameters and QoS measures throughout its operation. The
class of non-deterministic requirements imposes no bounds pertaining to
any descriptive characteristic and QoS parameter throughout the service
operation.*

### H.2.2 Descriptive parameters (Dsp)

*Application Relation (AR) and Communication Relation (CR): Most
industrial communications happen between two or more applications \[6\].
The AR parameter identifies the expected communication or traffic
pattern between interacting applications. The CR parameter describes the
different types of communication occurring in an AR instance. The CR
specifies the unique QoS requirements between interacting applications
or application functions and can be interpreted during service
provisioning for optimized resource allocations (configuration). The
AR/CR is described by three main labels: 1. Unicast 2.
Multicast\_One-2-M (one-to-many multicast) 3. Multicast\_M-2-1
(many-to-one multicast). Unicast models one-to-one relations,
Multicast\_one-2-M models one-to-many relations, and Multicast\_M-2-one
models many-to-one relations. An application may specify additional
identifiers for other applications it may wish to send messages to.*

*Transfer interval: measures the time duration for which an application
can repeat a routine task.*

*Message size: measures the amount of data (in bytes) that can be
transmitted at an instance of time by an application. The message size
for periodic applications constitutes the sum of all messages that are
sent within a cycle.*

*Send time: Measures the time instance for which an application can
begin transmission of its data. This is only required for scheduled
applications.*

### H.2.3 Quality of Service Parameters (QoSp)

*These are parameters that describe the requirements of the application
relative to the communication service performance.*

*End-2-end latency: The time required for a message to be transferred
from the ingress to the egress of a network (reference endpoints). This
is measured relative to the application send-time in the context of
periodic and a-periodic deterministic traffic.*

*Communication service availability: The ability of a service to be in a
state to perform as and when required given that all necessary
conditions (internal or external) are provided. This is part of the
dependability requirements \[7\].*

*Communication service reliability: The ability of a service to perform
as required without failures for a given time interval. This falls under
the dependability safety requirements \[7\].*

*Update time: The time interval between a message and a follow-up
message from an application measured at a reference interface or
reference point. This applies to periodic communication.*

*Survival time: The time duration for which data sent between
communicating applications (transmitting and receiving) can be lost
without affecting normal operation. In periodic communication, survival
time is often given as the number of lost messages. Any value above this
threshold results in failure.*

H.3 Requirement classification
------------------------------

### H.3.1 Deterministic periodic

*Deterministic periodic requirements are described by 4-tuples
\<transfer interval, message size per transfer interval, send-time,
QoS\> where the presence of bounds for the descriptive parameters
transfer-interval, message size per transfer interval, and QoS
identifies this group.*

### H.3.2 Deterministic a-periodic

*Deterministic a-periodic requirements are described by the 3-tuples
\<message size, send-time, QoS\> where the absence of descriptive
parameter transfer interval and the presence of bounds for the
descriptive parameters message size and QoS identifies this group.*

### H.3.3 Non-deterministic

*This requirement class specifies no bounds on QoS and descriptive
parameters within the duration of its operation. Note, transfer interval
is an irrelevant parameter within this class. Non-deterministic is
identified by the absence of bounds on descriptive as well as QoS
parameters.*

### H.3.4 Real-time and non-real-time classification

*Requirements are classified as real-time and non-real-time only by the
degree of measure of QoS parameters on timeliness. While the descriptive
parameters can unambiguously identify requirements to be deterministic
or non-deterministic (periodic and/or a-periodic), it is only the QoS
measurement parameters on timeliness that can identify a requirement to
be real-time (critical) and non-real-time (non- critical). The
criticality of the requirements is not an objective fact but a
subjective one (use-case or domain centric). This is particularly the
case given that QoS bounds, that are considered critical in one network
domain or use-case, may pass as non-critical in another. It is therefore
advised that real-time and non-real-time criteria should be defined in
the context of a domain or use-case. Domains include (but are not
limited to): industrial automation, data centers, IoT,
telecommunication, etc. Each domain may define a degree of measure for
which QoS measurements can be classified as belonging to real-time
(critical) and non-real-time (non-critical).*

### H.3.5 Other classifications

*Other aspects worth consideration are safety and integrity (security)
requirements. Though these are currently not considered in this work on
the communication service interface, their presence can give a complete
picture of requirements pertaining to accessibility, confidentiality,
and data integrity. Safety aspects are worth considering particularly in
industry automation. Safety classification should be based on
communication service availability, communication service reliability,
and maintainability requirements \[7\].*

H.4 Considerations on communication service interface 
-----------------------------------------------------

*The communication service interface contains two functional blocks: 1.
Input block 2. Output block.*

### H.4.1 Input block

*This functional block represents the service request description which
includes descriptive parameters (clause H.2.2) and communication service
QoS requirements of the applications. The content of the input block is
specified by the communication service requestor.*

*The following are sets of parameters that can be considered for input
and output functional blocks:*

*Reference end points of the communication service: These identify the
start (ingress) and end (egress) interfaces from which a communication
service can be provisioned. The endpoint identifies a single entity or a
group of entities. It can be a physical and/or logical endpoint. It
should be known to both the service provider and service requester(s)
(application).*

*Descriptive parameters (Dsp): These are parameters that describe the
inherent attributes of the application to the 5G network. These may
include as well QoS requirements.*

*QoS parameters (QoSp): These are parameters that describe the quality
of service requirements of the applications pertaining to the
communication service provided.*

*Security parameters (Scp): These are parameters for e.g.
authentication, access control, confidentiality, and data integrity
requirements of the application pertaining to the communication
service.*

*Safety parameters (Sfp): These are parameters pertaining to safety
requirements of the application.*

*Safety parameters and QoS parameters are also used to describe
dependability requirements needed by the application from the
communication service.*

### H.4.2 Output block

*This functional block represents the service response status and
additional information pertaining to the communication service. The
content of the output block is to be determined by the operation or
objective of the service request defined in clause H.5.1. The contents
of the output block are provided by the communication service provider.*

### H.4.3 Communication service interface consideration for 5G systems

*The communication service interface definition is subject to 5G
communication services and capabilities. In scenarios where an
application's requirement does not have a direct mapping to a service
parameter or capability as defined by the 5G vertical requirements, the
mapping can be made on the parameters that subsumes a similar or
analogous functionality to the definition and purpose of the parameter
as described by the 5G system.*

*The interface consists of mandatory and optional artifacts. The
optional artefacts only apply in the context of the application
requirement relating to descriptive parameters and QoS parameters. The
absence of one or more parameters in the optional artifact group should
not result in ambiguity of the classification and thus the communication
service outcome. The mandatory artifacts on the other hand are always
required for service identification, mapping decisions and responses.
The absence of these mandatory artifacts should result in immediate
cancellation of the request made on the communication service. These
artifacts may therefore not at any time be null. The mandatory artifacts
are marked by "m" and optional artifacts by "o".*

### H.4.4 General application and communication service interface format

> *CSIF\_{{input Block}, {Output Block}}*

*This presents a highlevel format of a communication service interface.*

> *CSIF\_Input\_Block { Objective\<m\>,Service Identification\<m\>,
> reference Endpoints\<o\>, Dsp\<o\>, Sfp\<o\>, QoSp\<o\>, Scp\<m\>,
> AR\<o\>,CS\<o\>}*

*This represent the input block format.*

> *CSIF\_Output\_Block { ServiceIdentification\<m\>, status\<m\>,
> (Dsp,sfp,QoSp)\<o\>}*

*This represent the output block format.*

*The interface should describe an objective, service identification,
service reference points, descriptive parameters, and communication
service dependability requirements which include safety parameters, QoS
parameters, and security parameters.*

*Service identification: This represents any form of identification that
can uniquely identify a communication service request amongst several
other communication services. It should be associated with a
communication service on the provider network.*

*Service reference endpoint: This is a unique ID that identifies the
endpoints of a communication service. This can be any form of ID that
uniquely identifies the network ingress and egress interfaces or the
user end station equipment (UE).*

H.5 Communication service objectives and candidate parameters 
-------------------------------------------------------------

*A service interface defines a set of mandatory and optional parameters
required to achieve the desired objective of the communication service
requestor. The service objective may consist of four operations:
disengagement, setup, modification and monitoring. Clauses H.5.1, H.5.2,
H.5.3, and H.5.4 illustrate these operations and parametric
consideration under each operation.*

### H.5.1 Communication service disengagement

*This operation triggers a tear down of an existing communication
service. Additional parameters required for such tear down are provided
according to the mandatory and/or optional parameters of the
communication service. Upon successful processing of this operation,
applications using this communication service should not be able any
more to send and receive message via the torn down communication service
of the 5G network. Below is an example format for communication service
disengagement.*

*CSIF\_Disengagement{{CSIF\_Input}, {CSIF\_Output}}*

> *CSIF\_Input{del\<m\>, id\<m\>, Scp\<m\>, referenceEndpoints\<o\>}*
>
> *CSIF\_Output{id\<m\>, status\<m\>}*

*CSIF\_Input: includes the service objective (del) and the service
identification (id). Reference endpoints may be optional. The service id
identifies univocally the communication service that is addressed by the
operation from all other communication services. It maps to a unique
communication service on the network. It should not be null. The
security parameters Scp should not be null. That is, a requester should
provide valid authentication credentials to carry out the operation.*

*CSIF\_Output: includes the service (id) and the status of the service
operation. The status should provide information regarding positive
(success) and negative (failure) acknowledgement of the operation.*

###  H.5.2 Communication service setup

*This triggers the configuration or provisioning of a new communication
service. A successful setup operation results in a communication service
via which the involved application can exchange messages. An
unsuccessful setup operation results in a scenario where the application
cannot exchange information via the network. Below is an example format
for communication service setup:*

*CSIF\_Setup{{CSIF\_Input}, {CSIF\_Output}}*

> *CSIF\_Input {add\<m\>, id\<m\>, Scp\<m\>, referenceEndpoint\<o\>,
> {one or more (Dsp, QoSp, Sfp)\<o\> }}*
>
> *CSIF\_Output{id\<m\>, status\<m\>, referenceEndpoints\<o\>,
> Dsp\<o\>}*

*CSIF\_Input: includes the service objective (add) and the service
identification (id). Reference endpoints may be optional. The service id
identifies univocally the to be setup communication service from all
other communication services. It will map to a unique communication
service on the network and should not be null. Additionally, it may
include one or more parameters from H.2.3.*

*CSIF\_Output: includes the service (id) and the status of the service
operation. The status provides information regarding positive (success)
and negative (failure) acknowledgement of the operation. In addition,
the output may include one or more parameters from the descriptive
parameters. Especially in the case of scheduled communication, the
network may be required to provide information on the send time or the
time an application can commence usage of the communication service. It
may also provide reference end points.*

### H.5.3 Communication service modification

*This operation triggers a change request to modify an existing
communication service. This operation specifies a communication service
id that can be used to identify a communication service of the network.
Below is an example format for communication service modification:*

*CSIF\_Setup{{CSIF\_Input}, {CSIF\_Output}}*

> *CSIF\_Input{mod\<m\>, id\<m\>, Scp\<m\>, referenceEndpoint\<o\>, {one
> or more (Dsp, QoSp, Sfp)\<o\>}}*
>
> *CSIF\_Output{id\<m\>, status\<m\>, referenceEndpoints\<o\>, {one or
> more (Dsp, QoSp, Sfp)\<o\>}}*

*CSIF\_Input: includes the service objective (mod) and the service
identification (id). The service id identifies univocally the to be
modified communication service from all other communication services. It
will map to a unique communication service on the network and should not
be null. Additionally, it includes the parameters of the modification of
the service. Security parameters (Scp) and id should not be null.*

*CSIF\_Output: includes the service (id) and the status of the service
operation. The status provides information regarding positive (success)
and negative (failure) acknowledgement of the operation. In addition,
the output may include one or more parameters from the descriptive
parameters (Dsp). Especially in the case of scheduled communication, the
network may be required to provide information of the send time or the
time an application can commence usage of the communication service. It
may also provide reference points.*

### H.5.4 Communication service monitoring 

*This triggers a query request for statistical information on an
existing communication service. This operation should not result in any
changes to the communication service on the network. The network
provides read only information regarding the specified communication
service. Below is an example format for communication service
monitoring:*

*CSIF\_Monitoring{{CSIF\_Input}, {CSIF\_Output}}*

> *CSIF\_Input{mon\<m\>, id\<m\>, Scp\<m\>, {one or more
> (QoSp,Sfp)\<o\>}}*
>
> *CSIF\_Output{id\<m\>, Scp\<m\>, status\<m\>, {one or more
> (QoSp,Sfp)\<o\>}}*

*CSIF\_Input: includes the the service objective (mon) and service
identification (id). The service id identifies univocally the
communication service. It maps to a unique communication service of the
network and should not be null. Additionally, it includes the parameters
to be monitored. Security parameters (Scp) and id should not be null. If
no QoSp nor Sfp parameters are specified, all performance metrics
related to the communication service are considered.*

*CSIF\_Output: includes the service (id) and the status of the service
operation. The status provides information regarding positive (success)
and negative (failure) acknowledgement of the operation. A success
results in the information regarding the communication service for the
requested metrics.*
