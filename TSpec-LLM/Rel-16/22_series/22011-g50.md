1.2 Definitions and abbreviations
---------------------------------

### 1.2.1 Definitions

In addition to those below, abbreviations used in this 3GPP TS are
listed in 3GPP TR 21.905 \[2\].

> **3GPP PS Data Off**
>
> A feature which when configured by the HPLMN and activated by the user
> prevents transport via PDN connections in 3GPP access of all IP
> packets except IP packets required by 3GPP PS Data Off Exempt

**PLMN**

A Public Land Mobile Network (PLMN) is a network established and
operated by an Administration or RPOA for the specific purpose of
providing land mobile communication services to the public. It provides
communication possibilities for mobile users. For communications between
mobile and fixed users, interworking with a fixed network is necessary.

A PLMN may provide service in one, or a combination, of frequency bands.

As a rule, a PLMN is limited by the borders of a country. Depending on
national regulations there may be more than one PLMN per country.

A relationship exists between each subscriber and his home PLMN (HPLMN).
If communications are handled over another PLMN, this PLMN is referred
to as the visited PLMN (VPLMN).

**PLMN Area**

The PLMN area is the geographical area in which a PLMN provides
communication services according to the specifications to mobile users.
In the PLMN area, the mobile user can set up calls to a user of a
terminating network. The terminating network may be a fixed network, the
same PLMN, another PLMN or other types of PLMN.

Terminating network users can also set up calls to the PLMN.

The PLMN area is allocated to a PLMN. It is determined by the service
and network provider in accordance with any provisions laid down under
national law. In general the PLMN area is restricted to one country. It
can also be determined differently, depending on the different
telecommunication services, or type of UE.

If there are several PLMNs in one country, their PLMN areas may overlap.
In border areas, the PLMN areas of different countries may overlap.
Administrations will have to take precautions to ensure that cross
border coverage is minimized in adjacent countries unless otherwise
agreed.

Note 1: ITU-T Recommendation Q.1001 \[4\] does not contain a definition
of the PLMN area.

**System Area**

The System Area is defined as the group of PLMN areas accessible by UEs.

Interworking of several PLMNs and interworking between PLMNs and fixed
network(s) permit public land mobile communication services at
international level.

Note 2: The System Area according to \[4\] Recommendation Q.1001
corresponds to the System Area.

**Service Area**

The Service Area is defined in the same way as the Service Area
according to ITU-T Recommendation Q.1001 \[4\]. In contrast to the PLMN
area it is not based on the coverage of a PLMN. Instead it is based on
the area in which a fixed network user can call a mobile user without
knowing his location. The Service Area can therefore change when the
signalling system is being extended, for example.

**Regionally Provided Service**

Regionally Provided Service is defined as a service entitlement to only
certain geographical part(s) of a PLMN, as controlled by the network
operator.

**Localised Service Area (LSA)**

The localised service area concept shall give the operator a basis to
offer subscribers different services (e.g. tariffs or access rights)
depending on the location of the subscriber. A LSA consists of a cell or
a number of cells within a PLMN. (3GPP TS 22.043 \[5\]).

**Tracking Area:**

> E-UTRAN utilises Tracking Areas (TA) for UE access control, location
> registration, paging and mobility management. The TA is independent of
> Location Areas (LA) and Routing Areas (RA). A TA comprises one or more
> E-UTRA cells Service requirements for E-UTRAN are specified in 3GPP TS
> 22.278 \[8\].

### 1.2.2 Abbreviations

For the purposes of the present document, the abbreviations given in
3GPP TR 21.905 \[2\] and the following apply. An abbreviation defined in
the present document takes precedence over the definition of the same
abbreviation, if any, in 3GPP TR 21.905 \[2\].

ACDC Application specific Congestion control for Data Communication

EAB Extended Access Barring

SSAC Service Specific Access Control

2 Roaming
=========

2.1 General requirements
------------------------

A UE with a valid IMSI may roam and access service in the area
authorized by the entitlement of the subscription.

If a communication has been established, the UE will in principle not
suffer an interruption within the PLMN area (provided the entitlement of
the subscription allows it). Exceptions are possible if no network
resources or radio coverage are available locally.

However, if the UE leaves the PLMN area, an established communication
may terminate. If the user then wants to continue, another network
providing service has to be selected and a new communication has to be
established (see clause 3).

Subject to roaming agreements, a visited network shall be able to
prevent incoming roamers from using a particular radio access technology
(e.g. when the home network has not implemented this radio access
technology).

2.2 International roaming
-------------------------

International roaming is a service whereby an UE of a given PLMN is able
to obtain service from a PLMN of another country.

The availability of International Roaming is subject to inter-PLMN
agreements.

2.3 National roaming
--------------------

National Roaming is a service whereby an UE of a given PLMN is able to
obtain service from another PLMN of the same country, anywhere, or on a
regional basis.

The availability of National Roaming depends on the home PLMN of the
requesting UE and the visited PLMN; it does not depend on subscription
arrangements.

2.4 Roaming in shared networks
------------------------------

The following requirements are applicable to GERAN, UTRAN and E-UTRAN
sharing scenarios:

\- Mechanisms shall be specified to enable flexible allocation of
visiting roamers among core network operators that have roaming
agreements with the same roaming partners. The core network operators
shall be able to pre-define their relative share of visiting roamers and
distribute the visiting roamers that apply automatic network selection
to different core networks connected to the radio access network
accordingly.

\- When network sharing exists between different operators and a user
roams into the shared network it shall be possible for that user to
register with a core network operator (among the network sharing
partners) that the user\'s home operator has a roaming agreement with,
even if the operator is not operating a radio access network in that
area.

\- The selection of a core network operator among those connected to the
shared radio access network can either be manual (i.e. performed by the
user after obtaining a list of available core network operators) or
automatic (i.e. performed by the UE according to user and operator
preferred settings). For further information see clause 3.2.

3 Provisions for providing continuity of service
================================================

3.1 Location registration
-------------------------

PLMNs shall provide a location registration function with the main
purpose of providing continuity of service to UEs over the whole system
area. The location registration function shall be such as to allow:

\- Fixed subscribers to call a UE by only using the directory number of
the UE irrespective of where the UE is located in the system area at the
time of the call.

\- UEs to access the system irrespective of the location of the UE.

\- UEs to identify when a change in location area has taken place in
order to initiate automatic location updating procedures.

3.2 Network selection
---------------------

### 3.2.1 General

The UE shall support both manual and automatic network selection
mechanisms (modes). The UE shall select the last mode used, as the
default mode, at every switch-on.

As an optional feature of the ME, the user shall be able to set a
preference in the ME for the mode that shall be used at switch on. If
set then the ME shall select this preference rather than the default
mode.

Note: By defaulting to the last mode used, e.g. manual network
selection, the undesired automatic selection of an adjacent PLMN instead
of the desired HPLMN in border areas, can be avoided at switch-on.

The user shall be given the opportunity to change mode at any time.

Except as defined below, the MMI shall be at the discretion of the UE
manufacturer.

The UE shall contain display functions by which Available PLMNs and the
Selected PLMN can be indicated.

In order not to confuse the user, the same definitions of PLMN names
shall be applied consistently both in registered mode and in the list
presented to the user when in manual mode.

In shared networks a radio access network can be part of more than one
PLMN. This shall be transparent to the user, i.e. the UE shall be able
to indicate those PLMNs to the user, and the UE shall support network
selection among those PLMNs, as in non-shared networks.

### 3.2.2 Procedures

#### 3.2.2.1 General

In the following procedures the UE selects and attempts registration on
PLMNs.

In this TS, the term \"PLMN Selection\" defines a UE based procedure,
whereby candidate PLMNs are chosen, one at a time, for attempted
registration.

A User Controlled PLMN Selector data field exists on the USIM to allow
the user to indicate a preference for network selection. It shall be
possible for the user to update the User Controlled PLMN Selector data
field, but it shall not be possible to update this data field over the
radio interface, e.g. using SIM Application Toolkit.

It shall be possible to have an Operator Controlled PLMN Selector list
and a User Controlled PLMN Selector list stored on the SIM/USIM card.
Both PLMN Selector lists may contain a list of preferred PLMNs in
priority order. It shall be possible to have an associated Access
Technology identifier e.g., N G-RAN, E-UTRAN (WB-S1 mode), E-UTRAN(NB-S1
mode), UTRAN, GERAN or GERAN EC-GSM-IoT associated with each entry in
the PLMN Selector lists.

The UE shall utilise all the information stored in the USIM related to
network selection, e.g. HPLMN, Operator controlled PLMN Selector list,
User Controlled PLMN Selector list, Forbidden PLMN list.

Note 1: A PLMN in a Selector list, including HPLMN, may have multiple
occurrences, with different access technology identifiers.

The UE shall ignore those PLMN + access technology entries in the User
Controlled PLMN selector and Operator Controlled PLMN selector lists
where the associated Access Technology is not supported by the UE. In
the case that there are multiple associated Access Technology
identifiers in an entry the UE shall not ignore the entry if it includes
any associated Access Technology that is supported by the UE.

It shall be possible to handle cases where one network operator accepts
access from access networks with different network IDs. It shall also be
possible to indicate to the UE that a group of PLMNs are equivalent to
the registered PLMN regarding PLMN selection, cell
selection/re-selection and handover.

It shall be possible for the home network operator to identify
alternative Network IDs as the HPLMN. It shall be possible for the home
network operator to store in the USIM an indication to the UE that a
group of PLMNs are treated as the HPLMN regarding PLMN selection. Any
PLMN to be declared as an equivalent to the HPLMN shall be present
within the EHPLMN list and is called an EHPLMN. The EHPLMN list replaces
the HPLMN derived from the IMSI. When the EHPLMN list is present, any
PLMN in this list shall be treated as the HPLMN in all the network and
cell selection procedures.

If registration on a PLMN is successful, the UE shall indicate this PLMN
(the \"registered PLMN\") and be capable of making and receiving calls
on it. The identity of the registered PLMN shall be stored on the
SIM/USIM. However, if registration is unsuccessful, the UE shall ensure
that there is no registered PLMN stored in the SIM/USIM.

If a registration is unsuccessful because the IMSI is unknown in the
home network, or the UE is illegal, then the UE shall not allow any
further registration attempts on any network, until the UE is next
powered‑up or a SIM/USIM is inserted.

If the registration is unsuccessful due to the lack to service
entitlement, specific behaviour by the UE may be required, see clause
3.2.2.4.

To avoid unnecessary registration attempts, lists of forbidden PLMNs,
TAs and LAs are maintained in the UE, see clause 3.2.2.4 and 3GPP TS
23.122 \[3\].

Registration attempts shall not be made by UEs without a SIM/USIM
inserted.

An UE/ME which has not successfully registered shall nevertheless be
able to make emergency call attempts on an available PLMN (which
supports the emergency call teleservice), without the need for the user
to select a PLMN. An available PLMN is determined by radio
characteristics (3GPP TS 23.122 \[3\]).

#### 3.2.2.2 At switch-on or recovery from lack of coverage

At switch on, when in coverage of the last registered PLMN as stored in
the SIM/USIM, the UE will attach to that network.

As an option, in automatic selection mode, when no EHPLMN list is
present, the UE may select the HPLMN. When the EHPLMN list is present,
the UE may select the highest priority EHPLMN among the available
EHPLMNs. The operator shall be able to control the UE behaviour by USIM
configuration.

As an option, if the UE is in manual network selection mode at switch-on

\- if the last registered PLMN is unavailable and no equivalent PLMN is
available,

\- and the UE finds it is in coverage of either the HPLMN or an EHPLMN

then the UE should register on the corresponding HPLMN or EHPLMN. The UE
remains in manual mode.

If the UE returns to coverage of the PLMN on which it is already
registered (as indicated by the registered PLMN stored in the SIM/USIM),
the UE shall perform a location update to a new location area if
necessary. As an alternative option to this, if the UE is in automatic
network selection mode and it finds coverage of the HPLMN or any EHPLMN,
the UE may register on the HPLMN (if the EHPLMN list is not present) or
the highest priority EHPLMN of the available EHPLMNs (if the EHPLMN list
is present) and not return to the last registered PLMN. If the EHPLMN
list is present and not empty, it shall be used. The operator shall be
able to control by USIM configuration whether an UE that supports this
option shall follow this alternative behaviour.

NOTE: At switch-on and at recovery from lack of coverage, a UE in
automatic network selection mode can attempt registration once the RPLMN
or, if the above option is applicable, the HPLMN or EHPLMN is found on
an access technology.

The default behaviour for a UE is to select the last registered PLMN.

If there is no registered PLMN stored in the SIM/USIM, or if this PLMN
is unavailable and no equivalent PLMN is available, or the attempted
registration fails, the UE shall follow one of the following procedures
for network selection:

**A) Automatic network selection mode**

The UE shall select and attempt registration on other PLMNs, if
available and allowable,if the location area is not in the list of
\"forbidden LAs for roaming\" and the tracking area is not in the list
of \"forbidden TAs for roaming\" (see 3GPP TS 23.122 \[3\]), in the
following order:

> i\) An EHPLMN if the EHPLMN list is present or the HPLMN (derived from
> the IMSI) if the EHPLMN list is not present for preferred access
> technologies in the order specified. In the case that there are
> multiple EHPLMNs present then the highest priority EHPLMN shall be
> selected. It shall be possible to configure a voice capable UE so that
> it shall not attempt registration on a PLMN if all cells identified as
> belonging to the PLMN do not support the corresponding voice service;
>
> ii\) each entry in the \"User Controlled PLMN Selector with Access
> Technology\" data field in the SIM/USIM (in priority order). It shall
> be possible to configure a voice capable UE so that it shall not
> attempt registration on a PLMN if all cells identified as belonging to
> the PLMN do not support the corresponding voice service;
>
> iii\) each entry in the \"Operator Controlled PLMN Selector with
> Access Technology\" data field in the SIM/USIM (in priority order). It
> shall be possible to configure a voice capable UE so that it shall not
> attempt registration on a PLMN if all cells identified as belonging to
> the PLMN do not support the corresponding voice service;
>
> iv\) other PLMN/access technology combinations with sufficient
> received signal quality (see 3GPP TS 23.122 \[3\]) in random order. It
> shall be possible to configure a voice capable UE so that it shall not
> attempt registration on a PLMN if all cells identified as belonging to
> the PLMN do not support the corresponding voice service;
>
> v\) all other PLMN/access technology combinations in order of
> decreasing signal quality. It shall be possible to configure a voice
> capable UE so that it shall not attempt registration on a PLMN if all
> cells identified as belonging to the PLMN do not support the
> corresponding voice service.

In the case of a UE operating in UE operation mode A or B, an allowable
PLMN is one which is not in the \"Forbidden PLMN\" data field in the
SIM/USIM. This data field may be extended in the ME memory (see
clause 3.2.2.4). In the case of a UE operating in UE operation mode C,
an allowable PLMN is one which is not in the \"Forbidden PLMN\" data
field in the SIM/USIM or in the list of \"forbidden PLMNs for GPRS
service\" in the ME.

If successful registration is achieved, the UE shall indicate the
selected PLMN.

If registration cannot be achieved on any PLMN and at least one PLMN
offering restricted local operator services has been found, the UE shall
obtain user consent for restricted local operator services and the UE
may use a list of preferred PLMNs for restricted local operator services
stored in the ME. If none of the preferred PLMNs for restricted local
operator services is available, the UE shall select any available PLMN
offering restricted local operator services . If one of these PLMNs for
restricted local operator service is chosen, the UE shall indicate the
choice. If none are selected, the UE shall wait until a new PLMN is
detected, or new location areas or tracking areas of an allowed PLMN are
found which are not in the forbidden LA or TA list(s), and then repeat
the procedure.

If registration cannot be achieved on any PLMN and no PLMN offering
restricted local operator services has been found, the UE shall indicate
\"no service\" to the user, wait until a new PLMN is detected, or new
location areas or tracking areas of an allowed PLMN are found which are
not in the forbidden LA or TA list(s), and then repeat the procedure.
When registration cannot be achieved, different (discontinuous) PLMN
search schemes may be used in order to minimize the access time while
maintaining battery life, e.g. by prioritising the search in favour of
BCCH carriers which have a high probability of belonging to an available
and allowable PLMN.

**B) Manual network selection mode**

The UE shall indicate PLMNs, including \"Forbidden PLMNs\", which are
available. If there are none, this shall also be indicated. The HPLMN of
the user may provide on the USIM additional information about the
available PLMNs, if this is provided then the UE shall indicate that
information to the user. This information, provided as free text may
include:

\- Preferred partner,

\- roaming agreement status,

\- supported services

Furthermore, the UE may indicate whether the available PLMNs are present
on one of the PLMN selector lists (e.g. EHPLMN, User Controlled,
Operator Controlled or Forbidden) as well as not being present on any of
the lists.

For the purpose of presenting the names of the available PLMNs to the
user, the ME shall use the USIM defined names if available or other PLMN
naming rules in priority order as defined in 3GPP TS 22.101 \[7\]
(Country/PLMN indication).

Any available PLMNs shall be presented in the following order:

> i\) HPLMN (if the EHPLMN list is not present); or if one or more of
> the EHPLMNs are available then based on an optional data field on the
> USIM either the highest priority available EHPLMN is to be presented
> to the user or all available EHPLMNs are presented to the user in
> priority order; if the data field is not present, then only the
> highest priority available EHPLMN is presented;
>
> ii\) PLMNs contained in the \"User Controlled PLMN Selector\" data

If a PLMN does not support voice services then this shall be indicated
to the user.

The user may select the desired PLMN and the UE shall attempt
registration on this PLMN. (This may take place at any time during the
presentation of PLMNs.)

If registration cannot be achieved on any PLMN and at least one PLMN
offering restricted local operator services has been found, the UE shall
obtain user consent for restricted local operator services and offer the
user to select one of these networks. If one of these networks is
selected, the UE shall indicate the selected PLMN, wait until a new PLMN
is detected, or new location areas or tracking areas of an allowed PLMN
are found which are not in the forbidden LA or TA list(s), and then
repeat the procedure.

If the registration cannot be achieved on any PLMN and no PLMN offering
restricted local operator services is selected, the UE shall indicate
\"No Service\". The user may then select and attempt to register on
another or the same PLMN following the above procedure. The UE shall not
attempt to register on a PLMN which has not been selected by the user.

Once the UE has registered on a PLMN selected by the user, the UE shall
not automatically register on a different PLMN unless:

i\) The new PLMN is declared as an equivalent PLMN by the registered
PLMN;

or,

ii\) The user selects automatic mode.

If a PLMN is selected but the UE cannot register on it because
registration is rejected with the cause \"PLMN not allowed\", the UE
shall add the PLMN to the \"Forbidden PLMN\" list (clause 3.2.2.4.1).
The UE shall not re-attempt to register on that network unless the same
PLMN is selected again by the user.

If a PLMN is selected but the UE cannot register for PS services on it
because registration is rejected with the cause \"GPRS services not
allowed in this PLMN\", the UE shall not re-attempt to register for
E-UTRAN or UTRAN PS or GERAN PS on that network. The PLMN is added to
the list \"Forbidden PLMN\'s for GPRS services\". The UE shall not
re-attempt to register for E-UTRAN or UTRAN PS or GERAN PS on that
network unless the same PLMN is selected again by the user. The
reception of the cause \"GPRS services not allowed in this PLMN\", does
not affect the CS service.

For requirements to restrict the access of a UE to one or several
specific RATs see clause 7.1.

If a PLMN is selected but the UE cannot register on it for other
reasons, the UE shall, upon detection of a new LA (not in a forbidden LA
list) of the selected PLMN, attempt to register on the PLMN.

If the UE is registered on a PLMN but loses coverage, different
(discontinuous) carrier search schemes may be used to minimize the time
to find a new valid BCCH carrier and maintain battery life, e.g. by
prioritizing the search in favour of BCCH carriers of the registered
PLMN.

#### 3.2.2.3 User reselection

At any time, the user may request the UE to initiate reselection and
registration onto an alternative available PLMN, according to the
following procedures, dependent upon the operating mode.

**A) Automatic Network Selection Mode**

The UE shall follow the procedure defined in clause 3.2.2.2.A) above.

**B) Manual Network Selection Mode**

The procedure of 3.2.2.2 B) is followed.

#### 3.2.2.4 Mobile Station reactions to indications of service restriction from the network

Different types of UE behaviour is required to support, for example,
national roaming, regionally provided service and temporary
international roaming restrictions. The behaviour to be followed by the
UE is indicated by the network.

##### 3.2.2.4.1 \"Permanent\" PLMN restriction

When a registration attempt by the UE is rejected by a network with an
indication of \"permanent\" PLMN restriction, the PLMN identity shall be
written to a list of \"Forbidden PLMNs\" stored in a data field in the
SIM/USIM.

If a successful registration is achieved on a PLMN in the \"Forbidden
PLMN\" list, the PLMN shall be deleted from the list.

When in automatic mode, the UE may indicate any PLMNs which will not be
selected due to their presence in the \"Forbidden PLMN\" list.

If a UE receives an equivalent PLMN list containing a PLMN which is
included in the \"Forbidden PLMN\" list, this PLMN shall be removed from
the equivalent PLMN list before this is stored by the UE.

##### 3.2.2.4.2 \"Partial\" and \"temporary\" PLMN restrictions

When a registration attempt by the UE is rejected by a network due to a
\"partial\" or a \"temporary\" PLMN restriction, the UE shall perform
one of the following procedures determined by the indication in the
location update reject cause sent by the network (see 3GPP TS
23.122 \[3\]):

i\) The UE shall store the tracking area identity or location area
identity in the list of \"5GS forbidden TA, forbidden TAs or forbidden
LAs for regional provision of service\" respectively and shall enter the
limited service state. The UE shall remain in that state until it moves
to a cell in a location area where service is allowed.

ii\) The UE shall store the tracking area identity or the location area
identity in the list of \"5GS forbidden TA, forbidden TAs or forbidden
LAs for roaming\" respectively and shall use one of the following
procedures according to the PLMN selection Mode:

A\) Automatic network selection mode:

The procedure of 3.2.2.2. A).

B\) Manual network selection mode:

The procedure of 3.2.2.2.B).

iii\) The UE shall store the tracking area identity or location area
identity in the list of \"5GS forbidden TA, forbidden TAs or forbidden
LAs for roaming\" respectively and shall search for a suitable cell in
the same PLMN.

NOTE: A suitable cell will belong to a different TA or LA which is not
in the \"forbidden TAs or LAs for roaming\". When a TA supports multiple
systems (e.g. 5GS and EPS), a cell of the TA may be a suitable cell for
one system while the cell is not a suitable cell for other systems..

##### 3.2.2.4.3 PLMN restrictions for PS services

When a registration attempt for PS services by the UE is rejected by the
network with the cause \"GPRS services not allowed in this PLMN\", the
PLMN identity shall be written to a list of \"forbidden PLMNs for GPRS
service\" in the ME. This list is deleted when the UE is switched off or
when the SIM/USIM is removed; the maximum number of possible entries in
this list is implementation dependent, but must be at least one entry
(see 3GPP TS 23.122 \[3\]).

If a successful registration is achieved on a PLMN in the \"forbidden
PLMNs for GPRS service\" list, the PLMN shall be deleted from the list.

#### 3.2.2.5 Periodic network selection attempts

A UE in Automatic Mode shall make periodic attempts to look for a higher
priority PLMN including associated Access Technology of the same country
as the currently received PLMN including associated Access Technology.
For the ranking of PLMNs the UE shall use the order used in clause
3.2.2.2. In the case that there is no associated Access Technology
identifier, the mobile shall assume that all Access Technologies
provided by a PLMN are of equal priority. Moreover, periodic network
selection shall not lead to change of access technology within the
registered PLMN.

In the case that the UE has stored a list of equivalent PLMNs, the UE
shall only select a PLMN if it has a higher priority than all the PLMNs,
in the list of equivalent PLMNs, which are of the same country as the
currently registered PLMN.

Note: In the context of this 3GPP TS, the term country is to be
interpreted not as a political entity but as a single Mobile Country
Code (MCC). For example the USA and India have multiple MCC. Such cases
are in fact treated as exceptions in the 3GPP specifications. For all
other countries, multiple MCCs may be used, however the specifications
have not taken this into account and there could be adverse effects such
as the UE being unable to detect that multiple MCCs are within the same
country.

In the case that there are multiple EHPLMNs available, the UE shall not
attempt to select a higher priority EHPLMN when an EHPLMN has already
been selected. The priorities of EHPLMNs are only applicable when the UE
is on a VPLMN and multiple EHPLMNs are available.

The UE shall only make reselection attempts while in idle mode. In case
of GPRS terminals, the UE shall only make reselection attempts while in
Idle or Stand-by mode. In case of terminals operating E-UTRA and/or NR,
the UE shall only make reselection attempts while in Idle or
RRC-Inactive mode.

In the case of a UE receiving an eMBMS transport service when in idle
mode, the UE may postpone the higher priority PLMN search and any
reselection attempt until the eMBMS transport service has finished or
been stopped.

The interval between attempts shall be stored in the SIM/USIM.

Only the service provider shall be able to select for which of the
previous situations, periodic network selection shall be attempted and
to set the interval value.

For UEs supporting only Access Technologies other than the following:
NB-IoT, GERAN EC-GSM-IoT and Category M1 \[17\] of E-UTRAN enhanced-MTC
the UE shall interpret the interval value to be between 6 minutes and 8
hours, with a step size of 6 minutes.

For UEs only supporting any of the following, or a combination of,
NB-IoT, GERAN EC-GSM-IoT \[18\], and Category M1\[13\] of E-UTRAN
enhanced-MTC, the UE shall interpret the interval value to be between 2
and 240 hours, with a step size of 2 hours between 2 and 80 hours and a
step size of 4 hours between 80 and 240 hours.

For UEs supporting a combination of IoT and non-IoT Access Technologies
the UE shall interpret the interval value to determine the timer value
as above based on the Access Technology currently in use by the UE.

One interval value shall be designated to indicate that no periodic
attempts shall be made.

In the absence of a permitted value in the SIM/USIM, or the SIM/USIM is
phase 1 and therefore does not contain the datafield, then a default
value of 60 minutes, shall be used by the UE except for those UEs only
supporting any of the following, or a combination of: NB-IoT, GERAN
EC-GSM-IoT \[18\], and Category M1 \[17\] of E-UTRAN enhanced-MTC. For
those UEs a default value of 72 hours shall be used.

Note: Use of values less than 60 minutes may result in excessive ME
battery drain.

#### 3.2.2.6 Investigation PLMN Scan

The operator shall be able to control by SIM/USIM configuration whether
an UE that is capable shall perform an investigation scan. This
investigation scan shall be performed after each successful PLMN
selection as well as during limited service state. The investigation
scan shall search for a higher prioritised PLMN that does not offer CS
voice service. If such a PLMN is available, the user shall be informed.
This enables the user to switch to such a PLMN using manual selection if
the user so prefers. The investigation scan shall not be performed when
no SIM/USIM is inserted.

#### 3.2.2.7 Void

#### 3.2.2.8 Steering Of Roaming

**Steering to a specific VPLMN**

It shall be possible for the HPLMN at any time to direct a UE, that is
in automatic mode, to search for a specific VPLMN and, if it is
available, move to that VPLMN as soon as possible. This VPLMN shall then
be regarded as the highest priority VPLMN as defined by the operator,
though any EHPLMN or PLMN on the User Controlled PLMN list shall have
higher priority. This process shall be done transparently and without
inconvenience to the user.

If the UE is in manual mode, the steering request shall be ignored.

If the UE is registered on a VPLMN that is present on the User
Controlled PLMN List, the steering request shall be ignored. PLMNs
contained on the User Controlled PLMN List shall have priority over the
steered-to-PLMN.

The UE shall attempt to register on the specified VPLMN even if the
specified VPLMN is present on a Forbidden List.

This mechanism shall be available to the HPLMN even if the VPLMN the UE
is registered on is compliant to an earlier release of the 3GPP
specifications.

**VPLMN Redirection**

It shall be possible for the HPLMN to request a UE, that is in automatic
mode, to find and register on a different VPLMN from the one it is
currently using or trying to register on, if another VPLMN, that is not
in a Forbidden List, is available. The original VPLMN shall then be
treated as the lowest priority VPLMN and would not be selected by the UE
unless it is the only one available to the UE or has been selected in
manual mode. This process shall be done transparently and without
inconvenience to the user.

If the UE is in manual mode, the redirection request shall be ignored.

If the UE is registered on a VPLMN that is present on the User
Controlled PLMN List, the redirection request shall be ignored.

This mechanism shall be available to the HPLMN even if the VPLMN the UE
is registered on is compliant to an earlier release of the 3GPP
specifications.

### 3.2.3 Network selection for Multi-mode terminals with 3GPP Capability

Different type\'s of Multi-mode terminals combining different
technologies and systems in one terminal can be produced. It is not
possible to foresee all possible configurations and provide a detailed
technical specification for network and system selection for all
possible multi-mode terminal configurations. The following provides the
generic requirements for network and system selection for Multi-mode
terminals with 3GPP Capability. These requirements are mandatory for a
3GPP capable multi-mode terminal, unless otherwise is explicitly
specified elsewhere in the 3GPP Technical Specifications.

\- a multi-mode terminal, when in 3GPP mode of operation shall be
compliant to the 3GPP specifications, including PLMN selection, cell
selection and re-selection, paging reception etc.,

\- As consequence, the multi-mode terminal when entering 3GPP mode of
operation shall act as if it were a 3GPP only UE which had just been
switched-on. Similarly, when leaving the 3GPP mode of operation the
multimode terminal shall act as if it were a 3GPP only UE which had just
been switched-off

When the multimode terminal is in 3GPP mode, the switching between modes
in the multi-mode terminal is considered an overlay functionality
selecting mode of operation. For the design of the overlay functionality
the following requirements shall be fulfilled:

\- The overlay functionality shall include a mechanism to avoid
ping-pong between systems, e.g., a timer or hysteresis function

\- The overlay functionality shall not include network priority
mechanisms, which conflict with the network priority mechanisms
specified in 3GPP specifications, e.g., the Periodic network selection
attempts scanning within 3GPP based systems for PLMNs of higher priority
than the current serving PLMN.

\- Any functionality in the overlay system, such as background scan of
other systems, shall not impact the fulfilment of 3GPP protocol
requirements (in particular in regards to paging, cell selection, cell
re-selection and PLMN selection)

\- As specified in this technical specification, the 3GPP technical
specification provides the capability for the user to set their own 3GPP
PLMN selection preferences; as well as the user can manually select any
3GPP PLMN. This has been done to ensure a fair competition environment.
These principles shall be maintained in the design of the overlay
functionality.

4 Access control
================

4.1 Purpose
-----------

Under certain circumstances, it will be desirable to prevent UE users
from making access attempts (including emergency call attempts) or
responding to pages in specified areas of a PLMN. Such situations may
arise during states of emergency, or where 1 of 2 or more co-located
PLMNs has failed.

Broadcast messages should be available on a cell by cell basis
indicating the class(es) or categories of subscribers barred from
network access.

The use of these facilities allows the network operator to prevent
overload of the access channel under critical conditions.

It is not intended that access control be used under normal operating
conditions.

It should be possible to differentiate access control between CS and PS
domains. Details are specified in TS23.122\[3\] and TS25.304 \[10\]. Not
all RATs need to support this functionality.

4.2 Allocation
--------------

All UEs are members of one out of ten randomly allocated mobile
populations, defined as Access Classes 0 to 9. The population number is
stored in the SIM/USIM. In addition, UEs may be members of one or more
out of 5 special categories (Access Classes 11 to 15), also held in the
SIM/USIM. These are allocated to specific high priority users as
follows. (The enumeration is not meant as a priority sequence):

Class 15 - PLMN Staff;

-\"- 14 - Emergency Services;

-\"- 13 - Public Utilities (e.g. water/gas suppliers);

-\"- 12 - Security Services;

-\"- 11 - For PLMN Use.

4.3 Operation
-------------

### 4.3.1 Access Class Barring

If the UE is a member of at least one Access Class which corresponds to
the permitted classes as signalled over the air interface, and the
Access Class is applicable in the serving network, access attempts are
allowed. Additionally, in the case of the access network being UTRAN the
serving network can indicate that UEs are allowed to respond to paging
and perform location registration (see, sec 3.1), even if their access
class is not permitted. Otherwise access attempts are not allowed.
**Also, the serving network can indicate that UEs are restricted to
perform location registration, although common access is permitted.** If
the UE responded to paging it shall follow the normal defined procedures
and react as specified to any network command.

Note: The network operator can take the network load into account when
allowing UEs access to the network.

Access Classes are applicable as follows:

Classes 0 - 9 - Home and Visited PLMNs;

Classes 11 and 15 - Home PLMN only if the EHPLMN list is not present or
any EHPLMN;

> Classes 12, 13, 14 - Home PLMN and visited PLMNs of home country only.
> For this purpose the home country is defined as the country of the MCC
> part of the IMSI.

Any number of these classes may be barred at any one time.

In the case of multiple core networks sharing the same access network,
the access network shall be able to apply Access Class Barring for the
different core networks individually.

The following is the requirements for enhanced Access control on
E-UTRAN.

\- The serving network shall be able to broadcast mean durations of
access control and barring rates (e.g. percentage value) that commonly
applied to Access Classes 0-9 to the UE. The same principle as in UMTS
is applied for Access Classes 11-15.

\- E-UTRAN shall be able to support access control based on the type of
access attempt (i.e. mobile originating data or mobile originating
signalling), in which indications to the UEs are broadcasted to guide
the behaviour of UE. E-UTRAN shall be able to form combinations of
access control based on the type of access attempt e.g. mobile
originating and mobile terminating, mobile originating, or location
registration. The \'mean duration of access control\' and the barring
rate are broadcasted for each type of access attempt (i.e. mobile
originating data or mobile originating signalling).

\- The UE determines the barring status with the information provided
from the serving network, and perform the access attempt accordingly.
The UE draws a uniform random number between 0 and 1 when initiating
connection establishment and compares with the current barring rate to
determine whether it is barred or not. When the uniform random number is
less than the current barring rate and the type of access attempt is
indicated allowed, then the access attempt is allowed; otherwise, the
access attempt is not allowed. If the access attempt is not allowed,
further access attempts of the same type are then barred for a time
period that is calculated based on the \'mean duration of access
control\' provided by the network and the random number drawn by the UE.

\- The serving network shall be able to indicate whether or not a UE
shall apply Access Class Barring for SMS access attempts in SMS over
SGs, SMS over IMS (SMS over IP), and SMS over S102. This indication is
valid for Access Classes 0-9 and 11-15.

\- The serving network shall be able to indicate whether or not a UE
shall apply Access Class Barring for MMTEL voice access attempts. This
indication is valid for Access Classes 0-9 and 11-15.

\- The serving network shall be able to indicate whether or not a UE
shall apply Access Class Barring for MMTEL video access attempts. This
indication is valid for Access Classes 0-9 and 11-15.

### 4.3.2 Service Specific Access Control

Additionally to the above requirements in 4.3.1;

\- In E-UTRAN it shall be possible to support a capability called
Service Specific Access Control (SSAC) to apply independent access
control for telephony services (MMTEL) for mobile originating session
requests from idle-mode and connected-mode as following:

\- The serving network shall be able to indicate (as specified in clause
4.3.1) whether or not a UE subject to SSAC shall also apply Access Class
Barring.

\- EPS shall provide a capability to assign a service probability factor
\[13\] and mean duration of access control for each of MMTEL voice and
MMTEL video:

\- assign a barring rate (percentage) commonly applicable for Access
Classes 0-9

\- assign a flag barring status (barred /unbarred) for each Access Class
in the range 11-15.

\- SSAC shall not apply to Access Class 10.

\- SSAC can be provided by the VPLMN based on operator policy without
accessing the HPLMN.

\- SSAC shall provide mechanisms to minimize service availability
degradation (i.e. radio resource shortage) due to the mass simultaneous
mobile originating session requests and maximize the availability of the
wireless access resources for non-barred services.

\- The serving network shall be able to broadcast mean durations of
access control, barring rates for Access Classes 0-9, barring status for
Access class in the range 11-15 to the UE.

\- The UE determines the barring status with the information provided
from the serving network, and perform the access attempt accordingly.
The UE draws a uniform random number between 0 and 1 when initiating
connection establishment and compares with the current barring rate to
determine whether it is barred or not. When the uniform random number is
less than the current barring rate and the type of access attempt is
indicated allowed, then the access attempt is allowed; otherwise, the
access attempt is not allowed. If the access attempt is not allowed,
further access attempts of the same type are then barred for a time
period that is calculated based on the \'mean duration of access
control\' provided by the network and the random number drawn by the UE.

### 4.3.3 Access Control for CSFB

Access control for CSFB provides a mechanism to prohibit UEs to access
E-UTRAN to perform CSFB. It minimizes service availability degradation
(i.e. radio resource shortage, congestion of fallback network) caused by
mass simultaneous mobile originating requests for CSFB and increases the
availability of the E-UTRAN resources for UEs accessing other services.

When an operator determines that it is appropriate to apply access
control for CSFB, the network may broadcast necessary information to
provide access control for CSFB for each class to UEs in a specific
area. The network shall be able to separately apply access control for
CSFB, SSAC and enhanced Access control on E-UTRAN.

The following requirements apply for CSFB to 1xRTT:

\- In E-UTRAN, the network may apply access control for mobile
originating session requests on CSFB from 1xRTT/E-UTRAN UE, The
parameters received by the UE are dealt with in accordance with CDMA2000
procedures in 3GPP2 C.S0004-A: \"Signaling Link Access Control (LAC)
Standard for cdma2000 Spread Spectrum Systems -- Addendum 2\" \[15\].

For CSFB to UTRAN or GERAN, the necessary information in the broadcast
to provide access control for CSFB is the same as that specified in
Clause 4.3.1. In addition to those requirements the following apply:

\- Access control for CSFB shall apply for Access Class 0-9 and Access
Class 11-15.It shall not apply for Access Class 10.

\- Access control for CSFB shall be applied for idle mode UE.

\- Access control for CSFB shall apply to all CSFB services.

\- Access control for CSFB may be provided by the VPLMN based on
operator policy without accessing the HPLMN.

\- If Access control for CSFB, according to the UE\'s access class,
disallows originating session requests for CSFB then a UE shall not send
mobile originating session requests for CSFB.

\- If Access control for CSFB is applied by the UE for a mobile
originating session request for CSFB, the UE shall bypass enhanced
Access control on E-UTRAN for that session.

\- The criteria on which a UE determines whether Access control for CSFB
allows or disallows originating session requests for CSFB are equivalent
to those for enhanced Access control on E-UTRAN, as described in clause
4.3.1.

\- If access is not granted for the UE, mobile originating session
requests for CSFB shall be restricted for a certain period of time to
avoid overload of E-UTRAN due to continuous mobile originating session
requests from the same UE. The duration of the period shall be
determined using the same operation specified in Clause 4.3.1.

\- In case the network does not provide the Access control for CSFB
information, the UE shall be subject to access class barring for Access
Classes 0-9 and 11-15 as described in Clause 4.3.1.

### 4.3.4 Extended Access Barring

#### 4.3.4.1 General

Extended Access Barring (EAB) is a mechanism for the operator(s) to
control Mobile Originating access attempts from UEs that are configured
for EAB in order to prevent overload of the access network and/or the
core network. In congestion situations, the operator can restrict access
from UEs configured for EAB while permitting access from other UEs. UEs
configured for EAB are considered more tolerant to access restrictions
than other UEs. When an operator determines that it is appropriate to
apply EAB, the network broadcasts necessary information to provide EAB
control for UEs in a specific area. The following requirements apply for
EAB:

-   The UE is configured for EAB by the HPLMN

> \- EAB shall be applicable to all 3GPP Radio Access Technologies used
> in EPS or UMTS.

NOTE 1: When a UE configured for EAB is located in 5G system, the UE is
considered as configured for delay tolerant service.

\- EAB shall be applicable regardless of whether the UE is in a Home or
a Visited PLMN.

\- A network may broadcast EAB information.

\- EAB information shall define whether EAB applies to UEs within one of
the following categories:

a\) UEs that are configured for EAB;

b\) UEs that are configured for EAB and are neither in their HPLMN nor
in a PLMN that is equivalent to it;

c\) UEs that are configured for EAB and are neither in the PLMN listed
as most preferred PLMN of the country where the UE is roaming in the
operator-defined PLMN selector list on the SIM/USIM, nor in their HPLMN
nor in a PLMN that is equivalent to their HPLMN

\- EAB information shall also include extended barring information for
Access Classes 0-9.

\- A UE configured for EAB shall use its allocated Access Class(es), as
defined in clause 4.2, when evaluating the EAB information that is
broadcast by the network, in order to determine if its access to the
network is barred.

\- If a UE that is configured for EAB answers to paging, initiates an
emergency call or, is a member of an Access Class in the range 11-15 and
according to clause 4.3.1 that Access Class is permitted by the network,
then the UE shall ignore any EAB information that is broadcast by the
network.

\- If the network is not broadcasting the EAB information, the UE shall
be subject to access barring as described in clause 4.3.1

\- If the EAB information that is broadcast by the network does not bar
the UE, the UE shall be subject to access barring as described in clause
4.3.1.

\- In the case of multiple core networks sharing the same access
network, the access network shall be able to apply the EAB for the
different core networks individually.

#### 4.3.4.2 Overriding extended access barring

Overriding Extended Access Barring is a mechanism for the operator to
allow UEs that are configured for EAB to access the network under EAB
conditions. The following requirements apply:

\- The UE configured with EAB may be configured by the HPLMN with a
permission to override EAB.

\- For a UE configured with the permission to override EAB, the user or
application (upper layers in UE) may request the UE to activate PDN
connection(s) for which EAB does not apply.

\- The UE shall override any EAB restriction information that is
broadcast by the network as long as it has an active PDN connection for
which EAB does not apply.

### 4.3.5 Application specific Congestion control for Data Communication (ACDC)

#### 4.3.5.1 Service description

Application specific Congestion control for Data Communication (ACDC) is
an access control mechanism for the operator to allow/prevent new access
attempts from particular, operator-identified applications in the UE in
idle mode. ACDC does not apply to UEs in connected mode. The network can
prevent/mitigate overload of the access network and/or the core network.
This feature is optional.

#### 4.3.5.2 Requirements

##### 4.3.5.2.1 General

The following requirements apply:

\- This feature shall be applicable to UTRAN PS Domain and E-UTRAN.

\- This feature shall be applicable to UEs in idle mode only that are
not a member of one or more of Access Classes 11 to 15.

\- ACDC shall not apply to MMTEL voice, MMTEL video, SMS over IMS (SMS
over IP) emergency call and paging response.

NOTE: Even if any of the above services are initiated by application,
ACDC does not apply, but they are subject to other applicable access
control methods.

\- The home network shall be able to configure a UE with at least four
and a maximum of sixteen ACDC categories to each of which particular,
operator-identified applications are associated. The categories shall be
ordered as specified in clause 4.3.5.2.2.

Note: Provisioning of the ACDC categories in the UE is the
responsibility of the home network, and the categorization is outside
the scope of 3GPP.

Note: A mechanism needs to be provided that enables the UE to verify
that the provisioning of the configuration originates from a trusted
source.

\- The serving network shall be able to broadcast, in one or more areas
of the RAN, control information, indicating barring information per each
ACDC category, and whether a roaming UE shall be subject to ACDC
control.

Note: The barring information may be similar to ACB information, and
include mean durations of access control (i.e., barring timer) and
barring rates (i.e., percentage value). If the barring timer is running
due to a previous access attempt from an application in a certain given
matched ACDC category, the UE may only allow access attempts from
applications in higher ACDC categories (according to the corresponding
barring information for those higher categories). If the barring timer
is running due to a previous access attempt from an application in a
certain given unmatched ACDC category or a uncategorised application,
the UE may only allow access attempts from applications in higher ACDC
categories than the lowest ACDC category broadcast (according to the
corresponding barring information for those higher categories).

\- The UE shall be able to control whether or not an access attempt for
a certain application is allowed, based on this broadcast barring
information and the configuration of ACDC categories in the UE.

\- The serving network shall be able to simultaneously indicate ACDC
with other forms of access control.

\- When both ACDC and ACB controls are indicated, ACDC shall override
ACB.

\- If a UE is configured for both EAB and ACDC, and the serving network
simultaneously broadcasts EAB information and ACDC barring information:

\- If the UE determines as specified in clause 4.3.4.1 that access to
the network is not barred or as specified in clause 4.3.4.2 that it is
permitted to override an EAB restriction, then access to the network is
subject to ACDC.

\- If the UE determines as specified in clause 4.3.4.1 that access to
the network is barred and as specified in clause 4.3.4.2 that it is not
permitted to override the EAB restriction, then access to the network is
barred.

\- In the case of multiple core networks sharing the same access
network, the access network shall be able to apply ACDC for the
different core networks individually. For the mitigation of congestion
in a shared RAN, barring rates should be set equal for all Participating
Operators.

##### 4.3.5.2.2 ACDC Categories

When configuring the UE with categories of applications, the home
network shall proceed as follows:

\- Applications whose use is expected to be restricted the least shall
be assigned the highest ACDC category; and

\- Applications whose use is expected to be restricted more than
applications in the highest category shall be assigned the
second-to-highest ACDC category, and so on; and

\- Applications whose use is expected to be restricted the most shall
either be assigned the lowest ACDC category, or not be categorised at
all.

For a UE with ACDC categories configured, the applications on the UE
that are not assigned to any ACDC category shall be treated by the UE as
part of the lowest ACDC category broadcast by the serving network. If
the operator requires differentiation with respect to these
uncategorized applications, the operator should avoid assigning
applications to the lowest ACDC category. When applying ACDC, the
serving network broadcasts barring information starting from the highest
to the lowest ACDC category. The home network and the serving network
may use different categorisation. The serving network decides if ACDC
applies to roaming UEs.

The number of ACDC categories in the UE may not be the same as the
number of ACDC categories broadcast by the serving network. This may
happen, e.g. when the UE is roaming and the number of categories
broadcast by the serving network is different from the home network.
Therefore the following rules shall apply:

\- If the serving network broadcasts more ACDC categories than the UE\'s
configuration, the UE shall use barring information for the matching
ACDC category, and shall bar uncategorised applications using the
barring information for the lowest category broadcast by the serving
network, and shall ignore barring information for unmatched categories.

\- If the serving network broadcasts barring information for fewer ACDC
categories than the UE\'s configuration, the UE shall use barring
information for the matching ACDC category and shall bar other
applications using the barring information for the lowest category
broadcast by the serving network.

NOTE: A matching ACDC category is an ACDC category for which barring
information is broadcast by the serving network and that has the same
rank as the rank of a configured ACDC category in the UE. An unmatched
ACDC category is either an ACDC category for which barring information
is broadcast by the serving network but with no corresponding ACDC
category configured in the UE, or an ACDC category configured in the UE
but with no corresponding barring information broadcast by the serving
network.

### 4.3.6 Void

4.4 Emergency Calls
-------------------

An additional control bit known as \"Access Class 10\" is also signalled
over the air interface to the UE. This indicates whether or not network
access for Emergency Calls is allowed for UEs with access classes 0 to 9
or without an IMSI. For UEs with access classes 11 to 15, Emergency
Calls are not allowed if both \"Access class 10\" and the relevant
Access Class (11 to 15) are barred. Otherwise, Emergency Calls are
allowed.

4.4a Multimedia Priority Service
--------------------------------

Multimedia Priority Service (TS 22.153 \[16\]) shall be assigned its own
unique access class value (i.e., one of the special access classes 11 to
15). The assigned access class value for Multimedia Priority Service is
based on regional/national regulatory requirements and operator policy.

4.5 Control of UE Capabilities
------------------------------

To protect the user from the effects of a misbehaving UE (e.g. causing
additional charges, degraded performance) and to protect the network
operator\'s network capacity, including radio resources and network
signalling and processing, means shall be provided for the HPLMN/EHPLMN
and the VPLMN to provide an indication to the UE as to which network
provided services or functions it is not allowed to use.

The Selective UE Capabilities list, shall be maintained in the UE and
the UE shall not request any services indicated as disabled. At
registration the HPLMN/EHPLMN or VPLMN may interrogate the status of the
list and provide a new list.

The Selective UE Capabilities list shall not be deleted at switch off
and will remain valid until a new list is provided by the network. The
Selective UE Capabilities list relates to the ME and not to the
subscription.

It should be ensured that UEs are not maliciously disabled, including
malicious disabling by a VPLMN, or accidentally disabled, or kept
disabled, and there shall be a mechanism for restoring disabled UEs in
all situations (e.g. in the case that the serving network does not
support the control of UE Capabilities).

The UE should use the indications given in the Selective UE Capabilities
list to inform the user of the non-availability of services or
functions.

There shall be a means for the network to provide an optional customer
service number(s) which can be used, by the user, to assist in
determining the cause of non-availability of specific services. The
specifications should also provide the capability for the network to
include an optional text string that will be displayed by the UE.

The UE Capabilities list shall take precedence over subscribed services.

The services to be included in the list are:

\- Call Control functions

\- Supplementary Services

\- Emergency Calls (including the (U)SIM-less case and subject to
regional regulatory requirements, i.e. emergency calls shall not be
disabled in regions where support of them is required)

\- SMS, via CS and PS

\- LCS, via CS and PS

\- GPRS based services

\- MBMS

\- IMS

4.6 Prevention of mobile-originating signalling and/or data traffic
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The network shall be able to control the behavior of UEs in E-UTRAN in
connected mode to prevent mobile originating signalling and/or data
traffic, while the access barring mechanisms specified under Clause 4.3
are being applied to UEs in idle mode.

5 Support of Localised Service Area (SoLSA)
===========================================

SoLSA consists of a set of service features that give the operator a
basis to offer subscribers different services (e.g. tariffs or access
rights) depending on the location of the subscriber. (3GPP TS 22.043
\[5\]). The following clause is only applicable to the support of SoLSA
functionality in GERAN.

5.1 Network selection
---------------------

The standard automatic and manual network selection procedures will be
used.

Manual network selection may be required when the PLMN providing the
users SoLSA service is not the one on which the user is currently
registered.

At manual network selection the UE shall provide the means to present
the subscribers LSA(s) for each PLMN presented.

5.2 The Idle-mode operation
---------------------------

The UE shall always select a valid LSA with the highest priority.

### 5.2.1 Subscriber moving from a normal environment to his localised service area.

The UE shall have the ability to prioritise allowed LSA cells in
reselection, making it possible to camp on a LSA cell earlier (the
function shall be network controlled).

### 5.2.2 Subscriber moving away from his localised service area to a normal environment.

The UE shall have the ability to prioritise allowed LSA cells in
reselection, making it possible to camp on a LSA cell longer (the
function shall be network controlled).

### 5.2.3 Subscriber staying in his localised service area

The UE shall have the ability to prioritise allowed LSA cells in
reselection by being more persistent (the function shall be network
controlled).

Note: Typically in indoor environments there are occasional reflections
and \"disturbances\" due to macro cells, e.g. near the windows. In such
a case LSA cells should be favoured even though there is higher field
strength available from the outdoor cells.

5.3 LSA only access
-------------------

It shall be possible to allow LSA user to access PLMN only within his
LSAs. A LSA user is not allowed to receive and/or originate a call
outside the allowed LSA area.

When UE is out of the allowed LSA area it shall be registered in PLMN
but indicate subscriber/service specific \"out of LSA area\"
notification. It shall be a network controlled function to prevent
terminated or/and originated calls. Emergency calls are however always
allowed.

5.4 Exclusive access
--------------------

Access to exclusive access cells is restricted to defined LSA
subscribers.

Non-LSA subscriber shall consider exclusive access cells as not
suitable, only allowing to camp for emergency calls (limited service
state 3GPP TS 23.122 \[3\]).

5.5 Preferential access
-----------------------

As a network controlled function it shall be possible in LSA to allocate
resources at call setup and during the active mode to LSA users compared
to non-LSA users.

6 Support of 3GPP - WLAN Interworking
=====================================

Support of 3GPP-WLAN interworking and network selection is captured in
TS 22.234 \[6\]

NOTE: The requirement specification 22.234 is no longer maintained from
Release 12 onwards.

6.1 Void
--------

6.2 Void
--------

6.3 Void
--------

7 Administrative restriction of subscribers\' access 
====================================================

7.1 Allowed Location and Routing Area identities access
-------------------------------------------------------

Means shall be standardised for an administrative restriction of
subscribers\' access without the need of having explicit
Tracking/Location/Routing Area identities in the individual subscription
profiles.

To achieve this it shall be possible to indicate per subscriber, in
subscription data, allowed categories of Tracking/ Location/Routing
Areas. It shall be possible to use this subscription information to
restrict subscribers\' access to categories of Tracking/Location/Routing
Areas in serving networks accordingly.

As a minimum, at least one of the following categories shall be
available:

a\) GERAN

b\) UTRAN

c\) E-UTRAN

d\) N G-RAN

There might be cases where the visited network has not separated the
Location/Routing area categories, in which case the administrative
restriction of subscribers\' access to only GERAN or UTRAN will not be
possible.

In EPS, an operator may introduce subscriptions supporting the 5G NR
Dual Connectivity in E-UTRAN. It shall be possible to indicate in
subscription data that a subscriber´s access to the 5G NR Dual
Connectivity in E-UTRAN service is restricted.

This administrative restriction of subscribers\' access shall be an
optional feature.

7.2 Void
--------

7.3 UE configured radio technology restriction
----------------------------------------------

A UE shall support a Man Machine Interface setting for the user to
disable use of one or more of the ME\'s radio technologies, regardless
of PLMNs. Radio technologies that individually can be disabled is
dependent on supported radio technology of the UE such as GSM/EDGE,
WCDMA, E-UTRA, and NR.

A UE shall support a Man Machine Interface setting enabling the user to
re-enable use of one or more of the ME\'s radio technologies for access
to a radio access network, regardless of PLMNs. The user can only
re-allow a radio technology that the user has previously disallowed.

NOTE: The described MMI user setting is a proprietary function of most
legacy UE products to allow a user of a UE to change the radio
capabilities of the UE. Legacy radio technologies may lack means to
mitigate some security attack. If severe enough, the home operator may
want to disallow their subscribers to access a radio access network with
such radio technology. This configuration of the UE is valid for all
PLMNs.

A UE shall support a secure mechanism for the home operator to disallow
selection of one or more of the ME\'s radio technologies for access to a
radio access network, regardless of PLMNs. Radio technologies that
individually can be disallowed are at least GSM/EDGE, WCDMA, E-UTRA, and
NR.

A UE shall support a secure mechanism for the home operator to re-allow
selection of one or more of the ME\'s radio technologies for access to a
radio access network, regardless of PLMNs. Radio technologies that
individually can be re-allowed are at least GSM/EDGE, WCDMA, E-UTRA, and
NR. The home operator can only re-allow a radio technology that the home
operator has previously disallowed.

For a prioritized service (e.g., Emergency Services, MPS, Mission
Critical Services), the UE shall support a mechanism to automatically
override user and network disallowed RATs when there are no PLMNs on the
allowed radio technologies identified that the UE is able to access.

Upon power-cycle or when the USIM is disabled, the UE configuration of
enabled/disabled radio technologies configured by the user shall remain
as it was before such events happen. The radio technologies disallowed
by the HPLMN shall remain as it was before a power cycle. The radio
technologies disallowed by the HPLMN shall be bound to the USIM

8 Support of Home NodeB and Home E-NodeB
========================================

The service requirements for Home NodeB and Home eNodeB can be found in
\[14\].

9 Control of traffic from UE-based applications toward associated server
========================================================================

9.1 Description
---------------

This feature allows operators to control traffic from UEs to an
application on a third party server or the third party server itself.
When an application on a third party server or the third party server
itself becomes congested or fails the traffic towards that server need
to be controlled to avoid/mitigate potential issues caused by resulting
unproductive use of 3GPP network resource. This will also make it
possible to allow 3GPP network to help third party servers to handle
overload and recover from failures (see \[7\]).

9.2 Requirements
----------------

Under network control, the UE shall be able to control (i.e. block
and/or prioritize) traffic from UEs to an application on a third party
server or the third party server itself without affecting traffic to
other applications on the third party server or to other third party
servers.

For this purpose, the UE shall be able to identify the traffic towards
the third party server or the application on the third party server.

When congestion or failure of the application on the third party server
or the third party server abates, the control shall be applied in a
phased manner to gradually restore traffic according to operator policy.

This feature and other forms of access control shall be able to be
applied simultaneously.

In case of simultaneous application of ACDC and this feature, this
feature shall take precedence over ACDC to control traffic from
applications in the UE, only when such traffic is allowed by ACDC.

This feature shall be applicable both to new connections being set up
and to existing connections from the UE towards an application on a
third party server or the third party server.

10 3GPP PS Data Off
===================

10.1 Description
----------------

3GPP PS Data Off is a feature which, when configured by the HPLMN and
activated by the user, prevents transport via PDN connections in 3GPP
access networks of all data packets except IP packets required by 3GPP
PS Data Off Exempt Services.

10.2 Requirements
-----------------

The 3GPP system shall provide a mechanism by which an operator can
configure which operator services are defined as 3GPP PS Data Off Exempt
Services for their own subscribers.

When 3GPP PS Data Off is activated in the UE, in order to preserve
charging consistency:

\- the UE shall inform the network that 3GPP PS Data Off is activated,

\- the UE shall cease the sending of uplink IP Packets of all services
that are not 3GPP PS Data Off Exempt Services,

\- the network shall cease the sending of downlink IP Packets to the UE
for all services that are not 3GPP PS Data Off Exempt Services,

\- the UE shall cease the sending of uplink traffic over non-IP PDN
types, and

\- the network shall cease the sending of downlink traffic over non-IP
PDN types

NOTE 1: Disabling of traffic on both the uplink and downlink is needed
in order to provide consistency of charging between HPLMN and VPLMN, as
well as consistency between what the user expects and what the user may
be billed for.

Each of the following operator services shall be configurable by the
HPLMN operator to be part of the 3GPP PS Data Off Exempt Services:

\- MMTel Voice;

\- SMS over IMS;

\- USSD over IMS (USSI);

\- MMTel Video;

\- Particular IMS services not defined by 3GPP, where each such IMS
service is identified by an IMS communication service identifier;

\- Device Management over PS

\- Management of USIM files over PS (e.g. via Bearer Independent
Protocol); and

\- IMS Supplementary Service configuration via the Ut interface using
XCAP.

3GPP PS Data Off may be activated based on roaming status, and the HPLMN
may configure up to two sets of 3GPP PS Data Off Exempt Services for its
subscribers: one is used when in HPLMN and another when roaming.

NOTE 2: The updating to the sets of configured 3GPP Data Off Exempt
Services in the VPLMNs and HPLMN is not guaranteed to take effect in
real time. The updating to the sets of configured 3GPP Data Off Exempt
Services in the UEs is not guaranteed take effect in real time.

The user should be made aware of the operator services that are 3GPP PS
Data Off Exempt Services.

NOTE 3: The system can support falling back to operate over the CS
domain in case an operator service is not configured to be a 3GPP PS
Data Off Exempt Service and an equivalent CS domain operator service
exists for the operator service.
