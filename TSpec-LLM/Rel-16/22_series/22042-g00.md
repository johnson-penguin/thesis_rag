Foreword
========

This Technical Specification has been produced by the 3^rd^ Generation
Partnership Project (3GPP).

The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work
within the TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the
TSG modify the contents of the present document, it will be re-released
by the TSG with an identifying change of release date and an increase in
version number as follows:

Version x.y.z

where:

x the first digit:

1 presented to TSG for information;

2 presented to TSG for approval;

3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.

y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e.
technical enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.

z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been
incorporated in the document.

1 Scope
=======

The present document describes the feature Network Identity and Timezone
(NITZ).

This feature provides the means for serving PLMNs to transfer current
identity, time, Daylight Saving Time and the local timezone to Mobile
Stations (MS)s, and for the MSs to store and use this information. This
enhances roaming by permitting accurate indication of PLMN identities
that are either newer than the Mobile Equipment (ME) or have changed
their name since the ME was sold. Additionally time, Daylight Saving
Time and timezone information can be utilised by MEs as desired.

3 Definitions and abbreviations
===============================

In addition to the following definitions, abbreviations used in the
present document are listed in 3GPP TR 21.905 \[1\].

NITZ The feature Network Identity and Timezone as described in the
present document.

UCS2 Universal Character Set 2

UT Universal Time

LTZ Local Time Zone, the offset from UT applying in that locality,
including any adjustments for summer time, etc.

DST Daylight Saving Time. Adjustment for summer time.

4 Description
=============

The feature Network Identities and Timezone shall make it possible for a
serving PLMN to transfer its current identity, universal time, DST and
LTZ to MSs, and for the MS to store and use this information. Each one
of these elements is optional. The feature significantly enhances
roaming as itenables the accurate indication of network identities that
are either newer than the ME or have changed their name since the ME was
manufactured or sold. Additionally time and timezone information can be
utilised by MEs as desired.

When using the default character set (see 3GPP TS 23.038 \[3\]), the
serving PLMN shall make both a \"short\" and a \"long\" name available
to the MS. As an alternative or, in addition, to the default character
set, the serving PLMN can make a name available in UCS2. The MS shall be
free to choose one of these names depending upon its own characteristics
and/or limitations, such as those of its display.

NOTE: Guidance is sought, particularly from non-European operators, as
to whether long and short name is required in UCS2 format.

The Network Operator may change the network identity at any time.
However the change of network identity need not force immediate transfer
of information to the MS.

As a network option, it shall be possible to send universal time (UT) by
the network. Time information shall include: Year, Month, Day, Hour,
Minute, Second, Timezone and DST. The expected accuracy of the time
information is in the order of minutes.

NOTE: Universal time indicates the time at which this information
element (see 3GPP TS 24.008 \[2\]) may have been sent by the network.
Thus it can be assumed that the accuracy of the time information when it
arrives at the MS is usually within a couple minutes.

The serving PLMN shall make Local Time Zone (LTZ) available to the MS as
an offset from Universal Time in units of 15 minutes.

When the LTZ is compensated for DST (summertime), the serving PLMN shall
provide a DST parameter to indicate this. The adjustment for DST can be
+1h or +2h.

For PLMNs which cover more than one timezone, it is assumed that the
Network Operator will arrange for boundaries between subsets of the PLMN
service area to be approximately aligned with timezone boundaries. When
an MS changes Local Time Zone the PLMN is not required to immediately
transfer new time zone information. Similarly the PLMN will transfer the
LTZ changes arising from summer/winter adjustments when convenient to
the network operator.

The MS will implement the new time zone information at an appropriate
time following receipt.

The information passed to MSs supporting the NITZ feature is controlled
by the serving PLMN Operator through administrative interaction. The
interface necessary to support this administrative interaction is
outside the scope of the present document.

5 Applicability
===============

Network Identity and Timezone is both an optional network feature and an
optional MS feature.

The NITZ feature is not intended to replace the existing method of PLMN
Indication, nor is it intended to discharge the administration and
maintenance of the associated MoU Permanent Document, SE13.

6 Normal procedure
==================

6.1 Transfer of NITZ information
--------------------------------

Network name, time, DST and timezone information can be transferred from
the serving PLMN to the MS:

1\) Upon registering on the network.

2\) When the MS geographically relocates to a different Local Time Zone.

3\) When the network changes its Local Time Zone, e.g. between summer
and winter time.

4\) When the network changes its identity.

5\) At any time during a signalling connection with mobile station.

Transfer of relevant information shall not unduly consume scarce network
resources.

6.2 Use of NITZ information
---------------------------

Relevant information shall be presented to the MS user at the earliest
opportunity.

It is expected that the MS will display the most up to date information
transferred to it.

Switching off the MS should not cause the updated name of the network(s)
to be deleted.

Removal of the SIM/USIM should not cause the updated name of the
network(s) to be deleted.

However, the number of different network identities retained in the ME
is a manufacturer issue.

Usage of time information in MS is a ME manufacturer issue. For example,
time information can be utilised to time stamp transactions for logging
purposes.
