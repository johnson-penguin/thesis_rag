b\) name unavailable.

The name identity of a PLMN subscriber shall always be provided by the
network.

**Calling Party:** The calling party is the originating party.

**Called Party:** The called party is the terminating party. The CNAP
service is provided to the called party.

**Calling Name Information:** The calling name information of the
calling party includes either the calling name identity or an indication
of privacy or unavailability.

3.2 Abbreviations
-----------------

In addition to the following abbreviations used in the present document,
abbreviations are listed in TS 21.905 \[1\].

CNAP Calling Name Presentation

4 Calling Name Presentation (CNAP)
==================================

4.1 Definition
--------------

The CNAP supplementary service enables the called party to receive the
calling name information of the calling party.

4.2 Description
---------------

### 4.2.1 Description

This supplementary service provides for the ability to indicate the name
information of the calling party to the called party at call set-up time
for all incoming calls.

The calling party takes no action to activate, initiate, or in any
manner provide Calling Name Identification Presentation. However, the
delivery of the calling name to the called party may be affected by
other services subscribed to by the calling party. For example, if the
calling party has subscribed to Calling Line Identification Restriction
(CLIR), then the calling line identity as well as the calling name
identity shall not be presented to the called party.

### 4.2.2 Applicability to telecommunication services

The applicability of this supplementary service is defined in TS 22.004
\[2\].

CNAP is applicable to all telecommunication services except Short
Message service. (for further study)

4.3 Normal procedures with successful outcome
---------------------------------------------

### 4.3.1 Provision

This supplementary service is provisioned for all Basic Services
subscribed to and to which it is applicable, i.e. not provisioned for
any subset of these Basic Services.

This service shall be provided after pre-arrangement with the service
provider. It may be provided on a subscription basis or be generally
available.

The override category controlling the name information is separate from
the override category for the line identity information. It is left to
the CNAP service provider to ensure that no discrepancy between these
two override categories occurs. The handling of override category within
a PLMN or between PLMNs shall follow the rules applying to the override
category of the line identification services TS 22.081 \[3\].

### 4.3.2 Withdrawal

The CNAP supplementary service shall be withdrawn at the customer\'s
request or for administrative reasons.

### 4.3.3 Registration

Not applicable.

### 4.3.4 Erasure

Not applicable.

### 4.3.5 Activation

The CNAP supplementary service is activated as a result of provision.

### 4.3.6 Deactivation

The CNAP supplementary service is deactivated as a result of withdrawal.

### 4.3.7 Invocation

The network shall automatically invoke the CNAP supplementary service in
the call set-up phase to the terminating CNAP subscriber.

CNAP is invoked when the Calling Name Information associated with an
incoming call is available and can be presented to the called party
which has subscribed to CNAP.

### 4.3.8 Normal operation with successful outcome

A user who has subscribed to the CNAP supplementary service and receives
a call shall also receive the calling name information of the calling
party, if available.

The calling party takes no action to activate, initiate, or in any
manner provide the calling name identity.

When the CNAP service is subscribed and activated, the destination
network provides the called subscriber with calling name information at
call set-up on all incoming calls or during an active call for that
particular call.

In addition to, or instead of, the calling name identity, the subscriber
may be given a presentation indicator with the relevant information.

### 4.3.9 Interrogation

**Status check**

The mobile subscriber can, by the appropriate control procedure, request
from the network the status of this supplementary service. Upon
receiving an interrogation request, the network shall send the status of
this supplementary service to the subscriber.

The information sent to the subscriber shall indicate whether the
service is provided to her.

The information sent in response to the interrogation of this
supplementary service shall not imply the status of any other
supplementary service.

4.4 Exceptional procedures or unsuccessful outcome 
--------------------------------------------------

If the name identity for a specific caller is not available, then the
CNAP subscriber shall be sent an indication that the name is
unavailable.

If the network has been unable to determine the appropriate name
information within a predefined time, then the CNAP subscriber shall be
sent an indication that the name is unavailable. The predefined time is
a network dependent value such that the called user may receive the name
in a timely manner prior to answer.

If the calling name information is not available due to a system
problem, such as signalling inter-working, then a standard error
treatment shall be provided, which may be a visual display to the
subscriber indicating the name is unavailable.

4.5 Alternate procedures 
------------------------

The decision of whether the user-defined name stored in the handset
should take precedence over the calling name identity provided by the
network is a handset implementation issue.

4.6 Interactions with other supplementary services
--------------------------------------------------

Only those supplementary services for which CNAP has any interactions
are detailed in this clause. For all other supplementary services not
mentioned in this clause no interactions were identified.

### 4.6.1 Calling Line Identification Presentation (CLIP)

No interaction.

### 4.6.2 Calling Line Identification Restriction (CLIR)

The CLIR supplementary service shall take precedence over the CNAP
supplementary service, unless the called user has an override category.
In this latter case, it is assumed that the override category for name
information has been set so that the name information is presented to
the called user.

The Calling Line Identification Restriction (CLIR) information shall be
used to restrict the delivery of the calling name to the called
subscriber. That is, if the calling party has activated CLIR then
instead of the calling name, a privacy indication shall be provided to
the called subscriber, which may be a visual display indicating
"private" (or Restricted) name. This method of restricting calling name
shall not restrict the use or implementation of other calling name
restriction methods when the calling party is a fixed subscriber. These
methods used by fixed subscribers are outside the scope of this
specification.

### 4.6.3 Call Forwarding Unconditional (CFU)

For an incoming call to a subscriber with both CNAP and Call Forwarding
Unconditional activated, the calling party name information shall not be
displayed at the forwarding subscribers terminal.

When a call has been forwarded and the forwarded-to user has been
provided with the CNAP supplementary service, the forwarded-to user
shall receive the name of the original calling party, if the calling
party has not subscribed to or invoked the CLIR supplementary service.

### 4.6.4 Call Forwarding on mobile subscriber Busy (CFB)

#### 4.6.4.1 Network Determined User Busy (NDUB)

Same as the interaction with call forwarding unconditional.

#### 4.6.4.2 User Determined User Busy (UDUB)

Same as interaction with call forwarding no reply.

### 4.6.5 Call Forwarding on No Reply (CFNRy)

For an incoming call to a subscriber with both CNAP and Call Forwarding
on No Reply activated, the calling party name information shall be
displayed by the predefined time while the call is alerting.

### 4.6.6 Call Forwarding on mobile subscriber Not Reachable (CFNRc)

Same as the interaction with call forwarding unconditional.

### 4.6.7 Call Waiting (CW)

If the served mobile subscriber is provisioned with the CNAP service,
the calling party name information shall be displayed to the subscriber
at the notification of an incoming (waiting) call as for a normal
incoming call.

### 4.6.9 Explicit Call Transfer (ECT)

For Further Study.

### 4.6.10 Support of Private Numbering Plan (SPNP)

The public number corresponding to the used PNP number is used to obtain
the calling name information for delivery to the called party's
terminal.

### 4.6.11 Completion of Calls to Busy Subscriber (CCBS)

No interaction.

### 4.6.12 enhanced Multi-Level Precedence and Pre-emption (eMLPP)

No interaction.

4.7 Service functions for roamers
---------------------------------

CNAP should be available to a roaming subscriber. However, the serving
system may elect to not offer the CNAP service to any subscriber.

4.8 Interworking considerations
-------------------------------

According to national network specific rules, the CNAP supplementary
services need not be applicable, if at least one of the two parties is
not an ISDN or PLMN subscriber.
