1 Scope
=======

This Technical Specification (TS) describes the Service Principles for
PLMNs specified by 3GPP. Principles and requirements for interworking
with WLAN are covered in TS 22.234 \[35\].

3GPP specifications provide integrated personal communications services.
The system will support different applications ranging from narrow-band
to wide-band communications capability with integrated personal and
terminal mobility to meet the user and service requirements of the
21^st^ century.

3GPP specifications allow the realisation of a new generation of mobile
communications technology for a world in which personal communications
services should allow person-to-person calling, independent of location,
the terminal used, the means of transmission (wired or wireless) and the
choice of technology. Personal communication services should be based on
a combination of fixed and wireless/mobile services to form a seamless
end-to-end service for the user.

3GPP specifications should be in compliance with the following
objectives:

a\) to provide a single integrated system in which the user can access
services in an easy to use and uniform way in all environments;

b\) to allow differentiation between service offerings of various
serving networks and home environments;

c\) to provide a wide range of telecommunications services including
those provided by fixed networks and requiring user bit rates of up to
100 Mbit/s as well as services special to mobile communications. These
services should be supported in residential, public and office
environments and in areas of diverse population densities. These
services are provided with a quality comparable with that provided by
fixed networks such as ISDN and fixed broadband Internet access;

d\) to provide services via hand held, portable, vehicular mounted,
movable and fixed terminals (including those which normally operate
connected to fixed networks), in all environments (in different service
environments - residential, private domestic and different radio
environments) provided that the terminal has the necessary capabilities;

e\) to provide support of roaming users by enabling users to access
services provided by their home environment in the same way even when
roaming.

f\) to provide audio, data, video and particularly multimedia services;

g\) to provide for the flexible introduction of telecommunication
services;

h\) to provide within the residential environment the capability to
enable a pedestrian user to access all services normally provided by
fixed networks;

i\) to provide within the office environment the capability to enable a
pedestrian user to access all services normally provided by PBXs and
LANs;

j\) to provide a substitute for fixed networks in areas of diverse
population densities, under conditions approved by the appropriate
national or regional regulatory authority.

k\) to provide support for interfaces which allow the use of terminals
normally connected to fixed networks.

4.1 Aims of 3GPP specifications
-------------------------------

It shall be capable of delivering audio, text, video and graphics direct
to people and provide them with access to the next generation of
information based services. It moves mobile and personal communications
forward from existing systems, delivering mass market low-cost digital
telecommunication and IP-based multimedia services.

The aims are:

\- to enable users to access a wide range of telecommunications
services, including many that are today undefined as well as multi-media
and high data rates.

\- to facilitate the provision of a high quality of service
(particularly speech quality) similar to that provided by fixed
networks;

\- to facilitate the provision of small, easy to use, low cost terminals
with long talk time and long standby operation;

\- to provide an efficient means of using network resources
(particularly radio spectrum).

4.2 Standardisation of Service Capabilities
-------------------------------------------

Existing systems have traditionally standardised the complete sets of
teleservices, applications and supplementary services which they
provide. As a consequence, substantial efforts are often required to
introduce new services or simply to modify the existing one
(customisation). This makes it more difficult for operators to
differentiate their services. At the same time however, this may reduce
the complexity of providing a service across different operators\'
networks.

3GPP shall therefore preferentially standardise service capabilities. In
circumstances where the service is meant to be used across different
operators\' networks, hence a common specification set is of paramount
importance, the service should be standardised to a level of detail
sufficient to ensure interoperability and interworking across different
operators\' networks. Service capabilities consist of bearers defined by
QoS parameters and the mechanisms needed to realise services. These
mechanisms include the functionality provided by various network
elements, the communication between them and the storage of associated
data. This TS provides a conceptual description of a service
architecture and architecture requirements which aim to provide service
capabilities. It is intended that these standardised capabilities should
provide a defined platform which will enable the support of speech,
video, multi-media, messaging, data, teleservices, user applications and
supplementary services and enable the market for services to be
determined by users and home environments.

### 4.2.1 Provision of service capabilities in shared networks

The provision of services and service capabilities that is possible to
offer in a network shall not be restricted by the existence of the
network sharing It shall be possible for a core network operator to
differentiate its service offering from other core network operators
within the shared network.

It shall be possible to control the access to service capabilities
offered by a shared network according to the core network operator the
user is subscribed to.

4.3 Efficient Use of Network Resources
--------------------------------------

### 4.3.1 Network Traffic Patterns

Service capabilities shall take account of the discontinuous and
asymmetric nature of most teleservices, multimedia services and user
applications and consider the overheads and signalling surge caused by
frequent transmissions of small amount of data by mobile data
application, in order to make efficient use of network resources
(particularly radio resources).

### 4.3.2 Mass Simultaneous Registration

When a large number of subscribers enter in a registration area in which
they have not registered, the core and radio access network shall be
able to provide a capability to optimize the mass simultaneous
registration traffic at a given instance of time. The core and radio
access network shall be able to keep providing the service (e.g. mobile
originated and mobile terminated services) without interruption for
those subscribers who are originally in the cell which receive the mass
simultaneous registration traffic.

### 4.3.3 Radio Interface

Service capabilities shall be provided in a wide range of radio
operating environments (where a radio environment is characterised in
terms of propagation environment, mobile equipment relative speeds and
traffic characteristics). Although 3GPP aims to minimise the number of
radio interfaces and to maximise commonality between them, it may
utilise several radio interfaces, each optimised for different
environments. Each radio interface may provide differing service
capabilities. 3GPP specifications include UTRA(N) radio interface
supporting two modes (TDD and FDD), an Evolved UTRA(N) radio interface
and GERAN radio interface. Additionally, it may be possible to connect
to the 3GPP system using radio interfaces and fixed access technologies
specified outside of 3GPP.

3GPP specifications shall provide a mechanism which will enable a piece
of user equipment (UE) to adapt to different radio interfaces as
necessary and to determine the service capabilities available. The
specifications shall also provide a mechanism which will enable a UE to
select radio interfaces capable of providing appropriate service
capabilities and support mobility between multiple radio interfaces.

### 4.3.4 Real-time Resource Usage

To enable network operators to render services efficiently, dimension
their networks and set tariffs that more accurately reflect radio
resource usage, real time information on resource usage is needed. When
requested, it shall be possible for the serving cell type (e.g. RAT),
cell ID / UTRAN Service Area Identity and cell / Service Area capability
usage (e.g. HSDPA, E-DCH) information to be made available to the core
network. Cell / Service Area capability usage information may include,
for example, user(s) identity, start and finish time of data transfer,
up-link and down-link data rates, volumes of data and other statistical
information.

### 4.3.5 Selected IP Traffic Offload (SIPTO) for PS Domain only

#### 4.3.5.1 Common Requirements for SIPTO in the Mobile Operator Network and SIPTO at the Local Network

The 3GPP system shall be able to offload selected traffic (e.g.
internet) towards a defined IP network close to the UE\'s point of
attachment to the access network.

The following requirements apply to Selected IP Traffic Offload:

\- The mobile operator may enable/disable Selected IP Traffic Offload on
a per UE per defined IP network basis (e.g. based on tariff,
subscription type etc.).

\- It shall be possible for IP traffic of a UE associated with a
particular defined IP network to be offloaded while IP traffic of that
same UE associated with other defined IP network(s) is not offloaded.

\- It shall be possible to perform Selected IP Traffic Offload for
pre-Release 10 UEs.

\- Offloading selected IP traffic for a UE shall not affect services
running in parallel for the same UE.

\- The mobile operator shall be able to collect signalling performance
measurements (e.g. session connection/disconnection, etc) related to
Selected IP Traffic Offload for each user.

\- Selected IP Traffic Offload shall not compromise the security of the
mobile operator\'s network.

\- Service Continuity of IP data session(s) for Selected IP Traffic
Offload may be supported during the following mobility events:

\- mobility between the macro network and H(e)NBs; and

\- mobility between H(e)NBs.

During both these mobility events, based on home mobile operator
policies, the impact of mobility events as perceived by the user shall
be reduced by minimising any interruption to the data flow.

\- It shall be possible for the HPLMN to provide the VPLMN with the
following information for a particular user:

\- An indication of whether the user\'s IP traffic is permitted to be
subjected to Selected IP Traffic Offload in the visited network;

\- The defined IP network(s) for which Selected IP Traffic Offload is
permitted.

Requirements specific to SIPTO at the local residential/enterprise IP
network can be found in section 5.9 in \[48\].

Some types of services (e.g. streaming services, VOIP, VPN, HTTPS-Based
Services) cannot tolerate a change of IP address of the UE without
disruption of the service.

SIPTO can be performed with or without coordination between the UE and
the network. The following requirements apply to coordinated SIPTO:

\- The 3GPP system shall be able to support multiple connections that
are associated with the same defined IP network where each connection
may or may not support IP address preservation.

\- The 3GPP system shall be able to determine if an IP flow requires IP
address preservation or not. Based on this determination, the 3GPP
network shall be able to offload selected IP traffic in coordinated
manner between UE and the network, in order to minimize service
disruption.

\- The 3GPP system shall be able to detect when a connection becomes
suboptimal and decide when to establish a new optimal connection to the
same defined IP network or use an existing connection.

Note 1: The definition of optimal and suboptimal can be based on a
number of implementation criteria like geography, topology and load
balancing etc.

\- The 3GPP system shall minimize the number of connections of a UE
without disrupting the UE's services, e.g. to ensure economical use of
network resources.

\- The 3GPP system shall be able to ensure that the actual average
aggregate bit rate for IP flows of packet data network connections
associated with the same packet data network does not significantly
exceed the subscribed aggregate maximum bit rate for this packet data
network when two connections are used with the same defined IP network.

Note 2: Requirements for Coordinated SIPTO do not apply to IMS.

#### 4.3.5.2 Requirements for SIPTO in the Mobile Operator Network

The following requirements apply to Selected IP Traffic Offload in the
mobile operator network:

\- The mobile operator shall be able to enable/disable Selected IP
Traffic Offload for certain parts of the network.

\- Selected IP Traffic Offload shall not compromise integrity and
confidentiality of offloaded traffic.

\- The mobile operator shall be able to collect statistics for the
offloaded traffic for each user.

\- The network shall be able to perform Selected IP Traffic Offload
without any user interaction based on mobile operator policies.

\- Service Continuity of IP data session(s) within the mobile operator
network shall be supported for Selected IP Traffic Offload. Based on
home mobile operator policies, the impact of mobility events within the
macro network as perceived by the user shall be reduced by either:

\- minimising any interruption to the data flow; or

\- preventing interruption to the data flow e.g. for voice services.

\- Service Continuity of IP data session(s) for Selected IP Traffic
Offload may be supported during the following mobility events:

\- mobility between the macro network and H(e)NBs; and

\- mobility between H(e)NBs.

During both these mobility events, based on home mobile operator
policies, the impact of mobility events as perceived by the user shall
be reduced by preventing interruption to the data flow e.g. for voice
services.

### 4.3.6 Paging policy selection for LTE

The 3GPP core network shall be able to use these additional criteria for
selecting a paging policy:

\- mobility information on the UE (e.g. the UE is stationary, or moving
only in a specified area)

\- application characteristics that are known and trusted at the serving
network (e.g. communication pattern, expected QoS (e.g. latency,
reliability), and priority)

\- likely location of the UE within the paging area

4.4 Compatibility with Global Standards
---------------------------------------

3GPP specifications aim to be compatible with IMT-2000 and to provide
global terminal mobility (roaming), enabling the user to take his/her
terminal to different regions of the world and to be provided with
services. It is probable that different regions of the world will adopt
different radio interface technologies. IMT-2000, as a global standard,
should therefore enable a IMT-2000 terminal to determine the radio
interface technology and the radio interface standard used in a region.
Global terminal roaming also requires the global standardisation of
service capabilities. As far as possible the method of indication of the
radio interface standard and available service capabilities shall be
aligned with IMT-2000.

3GPP specifications shall enable users to access the services provided
by their home environment in the same way via any serving network
provided the necessary service capabilities are available in the serving
network.

The 3GPP specifications will be available for the partner organisations
to adopt as their regional standards. For example in Europe, ETSI may
adopt them as standards for both GSM and UMTS.

4.5 Void

4.6 Functionality of Serving Network and Home Environment
---------------------------------------------------------

The following functionality shall be the responsibility of the home
environment:

\- User Authentication.

\- SIM/USIM Issue.

\- Billing.

\- User Profile/VHE Management.

The following functionality shall be the responsibility of the serving
network:

\- Radio or other means of access.

\- Transport and signalling.

The following functionality may be the responsibility of either the
serving network, the home environment or an appropriate combination of
both

\- Service Control.

\- QoS negotiation.

\- Mobility management, including roaming.

\- Automatic establishment of roaming agreements.

4.7 PLMN Architecture
---------------------

The network is logically divided into a radio access network and a core
network, connected via an open interface. From a functional point of
view the core network is divided into a Packet Switched CN Domain, IP
Multimedia (IM) CN subsystem \[27\] and a Circuit Switched CN Domain. IM
CN subsystem utilises PS CN domain bearer services.

CS CN domain supports bearer independent transport. There is no
difference in service offering or UE functionality due to different
transport.

A PS only 3GPP core network is possible as defined within the
specification for the Evolved Packet System (EPS) \[42\].

For further information see 3GPP TS 23.221 \[20\].

4.8 Interworking Between PLMN and Wireless LANs
-----------------------------------------------

Aspects related to interworking between PLMN and WLAN are captured in TS
22.234 \[35\].

4.9 Network Sharing
-------------------

Network sharing shall be transparent to the user.

The specifications shall support both the sharing of:

\(i\) radio access network only;

\(ii\) radio access network and core network entities connected to radio
access network

Note: In a normal deployment scenario only one or the other option will
be implemented.

It shall be possible to support different mobility management rules,
service capabilities and access rights as a function of the home PLMN of
the subscribers.

4.10 The Evolved Packet System
------------------------------

Evolved Packet System is an evolution of the 3G UMTS characterized by
higher-data-rate, lower-latency, packet-optimized system that supports
multiple RATs. The Evolved Packet System comprises the Evolved Packet
Core together with the evolved radio access network (E-UTRA and
E-UTRAN).The service requirements for the Evolved Packet System are
specified in TS22.278 \[42\].

4.11 User Data Convergence
--------------------------

### 4.11.1 Introduction

The UDC concept \[45\] supports a layered architecture, separating the
data from the application logic in the 3GPP system, so that user data is
stored in a logically unique repository allowing access from core and
service layer entities, named application front-ends. And such unique
repository shall be possible to be shared among different PLMNs that
have trusted relationships.

Network elements and functionalities should be designed to access
profile data remotely and without storing them permanently locally, i.e.
the front-ends shall work in a subscriber dataless configuration.

In some cases, services may depend on user data scattered over UDC and
other network elements. UDC may support the ability to access necessary
network elements to fetch user data on behalf of these services, while
minimizing impacts on existing Network Elements in which the data is
located.

Applications can subscribe to specific events which will likely occur on
specific user data, and those should be notified when those events do
appear. The events can be changes on existing user data, addition of
user data, and so on.

Third party applications and non trusted network elements should only be
able to access the user data after proper authentication and
authorization taking into account security and privacy requirements,
i.e. it should be possible to present different views on the data to the
parties which require access, dependent on the authorization. UDC
concept is backwards compatible with 3GPP systems, i.e. it does not have
an impact on traffic mechanisms, reference points and protocols of
existing network elements.

The UDC concept preserves user authentication and authorization of
services across domains, ensuring secured users\' access to network.

### 4.11.2 Management of user data

Due to the logical centralization of user data, it is necessary for UDC
to support the provisioning of the user data, that is, user data
manipulation like creation, deletion, reading, modification and other
operations. Provisioning shall be possible via an external system, self
care or dynamically via applications offering e.g. user service
configuration facilities.

Operations carried out in the framework of UDC shall support the ACID
(Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability) characteristics.

### 4.11.3 User Data Modelling

User Data Modelling refers to the different models that apply to user
data convergence: Information Models and Data Models.

An Information Model denotes an abstract, formal representation of
entity types, including their properties and relationships, the
operations (e.g. read, write...) that can be performed on them, and
related rules and constraints. In the information model, entities might
have network topology relationship with each other.

In order to accommodate multiple applications and services, existing and
new ones, a common baseline information model shall be developed and
shall, at minimum, clearly distinguish a number of concepts as entity
types:

\- Subscriber with relation to several users (e.g. a company and its
employees),

\- A user attached to different subscriptions (e.g. for a private and a
professional service usage)

\- A user using multiple devices (e.g. mobiles or fixed)

\- Grouping of users to certain categories

\- A particular user as member of a certain group

\- Service providers\' services provided by network operators

\- Enterprise services provided by network operators

The baseline information model shall be future proof. It shall not be
tied to any specific implementation of the data base or its interfaces.
It shall provide flexibility (in its data structure and content),
extensibility and multi-application approach.

By extensible, it shall be understood that new applications and/or new
service profiles can be added by the operator, if necessary. The
flexibility shall permit new data for existing applications to be
introduced, or modified.

Data Models are practical implementations of the information model, e.g.
Tree-like modelling. The common information model shall allow deriving
one or more data models. A reference data model shall be standardized
for the message exchange over Ud interface \[50\], in order to enable
multivendor interoperability.

Each application shall only interface the UDC for the data it is dealing
with, and not be impacted by other data that UDC stores for other
applications. It corresponds to the concept of a data view specific to a
given application.

An application can allow access by other applications to data for which
it is responsible. This can be done under certain constraint customized
by operators.

Access to the UDC data shall be independent of the structure of the data
models, i.e. the changes in the data models shall not affect the
interface.

5 Evolution
===========

5.1 Support of 2G services
--------------------------

The 3GPP specifications shall be capable of supporting existing 2G
services in a manner which is transparent to the users of these
services.

5.2 Provision and evolution of services
---------------------------------------

Since a phased approach has been adopted, the same general service
principles shall apply to each phase. Support of services from an end
user perspective is understood to be an important driver for established
mobile users to stay with their existing operator while taking the new
services into use. It is therefore important to enable operators to
offer continued support of legacy services in future releases. Previous
release services shall as a principle also be supported in the following
releases.

Networks shall be capable of providing a specified core set of
capabilities.

The core set of capabilities should permit home environment to offer a
range of distinctive services including those which cannot be
implemented on systems based on previous release specifications.

It shall be possible for the home environment to develop services with
full roaming capability.

The radio interface should not unnecessarily restrict the development of
new services (within physical limitations).

The standard shall provide a mechanism which allows a terminal to be
easily upgraded so that it can access new services which are within the
physical limitations of the terminal.

6 Classification of services
============================

In the CS CN domain, the basic services are divided into circuit
teleservices (3GPP TS 22.003 \[14\]) and bearer services (3GPP TS 22.002
\[21\]) and they can utilise standardised supplementary services (3GPP
TS 22.004 \[5\]).

The PS CN Domain provides IP bearer services. SMS, USSD and UUS can also
be considered as bearer services for some applications.

IP multimedia services are the IP based session related services,
including voice communications. IP multimedia sessions use IP bearer
services provided by the PS CN Domain.

Value added non-call related services include a large variety of
different operator specific services/applications. They are usually not
specified by 3GPP. The services can be based on fully proprietary
protocols or standardised protocols outside 3GPP.

In order to create or modify the above services (both call and non-call
related services) operators may utilise toolkits standardised by 3GPP
(such as CAMEL or LCS) or external solutions (e.g. Internet mechanisms).
Pre-paid is an example of an application created with toolkits that may
apply to all of the above services categories.

Figure 1: Service classification

7 Principles for new service capabilities
=========================================

7.1 General
-----------

3GPP specifications shall enable the user of a single terminal to
establish and maintain several connections simultaneously. It shall
efficiently cater for applications which have variable requirements
relating to specific QoS parameters (e.g. throughput) whilst meeting
other QoS targets. It shall also cater for applications which are able
to take adapt to a range of variations in QoS.

7.2 Multimedia
--------------

3GPP specifications shall support development of multimedia services and
provide the necessary capabilities.

Multimedia services combine two or more media components (e.g. voice,
audio, data, video, pictures, text) within one call. A multimedia
service may involve several parties and connections (different parties
may provide different media components) and therefore flexibility is
required in order to add and delete both resources and parties.

Multimedia services are typically classified as interactive or
distribution services.

Interactive services are typically subdivided into conversational,
messaging and retrieval services:

[Conversational services]{.underline} are real time (no store and
forward), usually bi-directional where low end to end delays (\< 100 ms)
and a high degree of synchronisation between media components (implying
low delay variation) are required. Video telephony and video
conferencing are typical conversational services.\"

[Messaging services]{.underline} offer user to user communication via
store and forward units (mailbox or message handling devices). Messaging
services might typically provide combined voice and text, audio and
high-resolution images.

[Retrieval services]{.underline} enable a user to retrieve information
stored in one or many information centres. The start at which an
information sequence is sent by an information centre to the user is
under control of the user. Each information centre accessed may provide
a different media component, e.g. high resolution images, audio and
general archival information.

Distribution services are typically subdivided into those providing user
presentation control and those without user presentation control.

[Distribution services without user control]{.underline} are broadcast
services where information is supplied by a central source and where the
user can access the flow of information without any ability to control
the start or order of presentation e.g. television or audio broadcast
services.

[Distribution services with user control]{.underline} are broadcast
services where information is broadcast as a repetitive sequence and the
ability to access sequence numbering allocated to frames of information
enables the user (or the user\'s terminal) to control the start and
order of presentation of information.

### 7.2.1 Circuit Switched (CS) multimedia calls

CS multimedia call is a Bearer Service which utilises Synchronous
Transparent Data service. The following basic requirements shall be
supported for CS multimedia calls \[24\]:

\- CS multimedia call shall be based on a 3GPP specific subset of
H.324M.

\- All call scenarios shall be supported, i.e. Mobile Originating and
Mobile Terminating call against Mobile, ISDN and PSTN call party.

\- Single and multiple numbering schemes shall be supported.

\- Fallback to speech (TS 11 \[14\]) shall be supported from 3.1kHz Ext.
PLMN multimedia bearer, i.e. if setup of the multimedia call fails the
call will be set up as a speech call.

\- Service change and fallback shall be supported for UDI/RDI multimedia
bearer and speech, to allow fallback to a less preferred service if the
preferred service is unsupported, and to change the service between
speech and multimedia during the call.

\- In the case where a CS multimedia call includes speech (e.g. video
call) then the following requirements apply:

\- A user shall be able to change between a speech and CS multimedia
call, when desired.

\- When the CS multimedia call is no longer supported, for example due
to degraded coverage conditions (including UTRAN to GERAN only
transitions), service change shall occur automatically from a CS
multimedia call to speech.

\- When a CS multimedia call can be supported, for example due to
improved coverage conditions (including GERAN only to UTRAN or
UTRAN/GERAN transitions), service change back to the CS multimedia call
may be initiated by the network.

\- Other services than CS multimedia call may exist which utilise the
Synchronous Transparent Data service. Service transition to/from speech
described for CS multimedia call in this clause shall only apply to CS
multimedia call and not Synchronous Transparent Data services in
general.

\- Different bitrates as specified at 3GPP TS 22.002 \[21\] shall be
supported.

\- Supplementary services apply to multimedia calls as for Synchronous
Transparent Data service according to 3GPP TS 22.004\[5\].

\- When accepting a multimedia call, the user shall be able to request a
service change to speech before the call is answered, such that the
multimedia path is never actually connected through to the user\'s
phone.

\- The user shall be able to deny a service change to multimedia during
the call.

### 7.2.2 IP multimedia (IM) sessions

IP multimedia services are not the evolution of the circuit switched
services but represent a new category of services, mobile terminals,
services capabilities, and user expectations. Any new multimedia
service, which may have a similar name or functionality to a comparable
standardised service, does not necessarily have to have the same look
and feel from the user\'s perspective of the standardised service. Voice
communications (IP telephony) is one example of real-time service that
would be provided as an IP multimedia application.

The following basic requirements are be supported for IP multimedia
\[27\]:

\- IP multimedia session control shall be based on SIP \[28\].

\- All session scenarios shall be supported; i.e. Mobile Originating and
Mobile Terminating sessions against Internet/Intranet, CS or IM Mobile,
ISDN, PSTN call party.

\- MSISDN and SIP URL numbering and addressing schemes shall be
supported.

\- IP multimedia applications shall as a principle, not be standardised,
allowing service provider specific variations.

### 7.2.3 Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS)

The following basic requirements are be supported for MMS:

\- Store-and-forward multimedia messaging service with mobile and
non-mobile users \[25\].

\- MMS shall be capable of supporting integration of different types of
messaging (e.g. fax, SMS, Multimedia, voicemail, e-mail etc.) in a
consistent manner.

\- Streamed and batch delivery for both message download from the
network to the terminal, and messages upload from the terminal to the
network.

### 7.2.4 Real-Time Text Conversation

Real-Time Text (RTT) conversation is a service enabled in 3GPP networks
by the Global Text Telephony ( GTT ) \[26\].

\- GTT enables real time, character by character, text conversation to
be included in any conversational service, Circuit Switched as well as
IP based.

\- It is possible to use the text component in a session together with
other media components, especially video and voice.

\- Interworking with existing text telephony in PSTN as well as emerging
forms of standardised text conversation in all networks is within the
scope of this feature.

\- The text media component can be included initially in the session, or
added at any stage during the session.

\- The text component is intended for human input and reading, and
therefore supports human capabilities in text input speed. The character
set support is suitable for the languages the users communicate in.

\- GTT specifies limited interoperation with Multimedia Messaging
Services including a possibility to divert to messaging in case of call
failure and sharing user interface equipment and external UE interfaces.

### 7.2.5 Packet Switched Streaming Service

The following basic requirements are to be supported for streaming :

\- The streaming service uses a client / server model which is
transparent to the PLMN. The client controls the initiation and
execution of the service.

\- The streaming service \[30\] shall use existing standards (codecs and
protocols \[31\]) where these are available.

\- The streaming service utilises the PS Domain with the QoS
requirements as specified in 3GPP TS 22.105 \[1\].

7.3 Service Management Requirements
-----------------------------------

3GPP specifications shall include standardised protocols enabling
service management. It shall enable control, creation and subscription
of service capabilities and services, and the management of user
profiles.

7.4 Automatic Device Detection
------------------------------

The home environment should be automatically notified when a user,
identified by a SIM/USIM, has changed ME and should be informed of the
identity of the new ME. This should be applicable to any ME. It should
also be possible to achieve Automatic Device Detection for users using
any SIM/USIM.

Note: The purpose of this is to enable an automatic configuration of
terminals by the operator for specific applications/services if so
needed. The procedure for such an automatic configuration need not to be
standardized by 3GPP.

The notification that a user has changed ME shall be given as early as
possible.

8 Service architecture
======================

In order to provide standardisation of service capabilities a service
architecture shown by Figure 2 is envisaged

Figure 2: Service Architecture

A number of bearers shall be provided that can differ in flexibility and
offer different capabilities. Bearers may be characterised by parameters
such as \"throughput\", \"delay tolerance\", \"maximum bit error rate\",
\"symmetry\" etc. These bearers enable information to be transferred
appropriate to the provision of teleservices, multimedia services and
end user applications generally, via subnetworks which typically provide
different specified qualities of service.

The assignment and release of bearers is provided by the bearer control
function. Provision should be made for several bearers to be associated
with a call and for bearers to be added to a call and/or to be released
from a call following call establishment. The bearers should be
independent of radio environments, radio interface technology and fixed
wire transmission systems.

Adaptation/Interworking functions are required in order to take account
of the differences between the bearers used for the provision of a
teleservice/multimedia service/application in the fixed network and the
bearers. Adaptation/Interworking functions are required which take
account of the discontinuous and/or asymmetrical nature of most
teleservices/multimedia services/applications.

The service platform shall provide interfaces (to serving networks and
home environments) appropriate to the support, creation and control of
supplementary services, teleservices, multimedia services and user
applications. The service platform will also provide interfaces enabling
subscribers to control supplementary services, teleservices, multimedia
services and user applications.

Supplementary service provision and control will be independent of radio
operating environment, radio interface technology and fixed wire
transmission systems.

As far as possible, the service platform is required to enable new
supplementary services, teleservices, multimedia services and/or end
user applications to be supported at minimum cost, with minimum
disruption of service and within the shortest possible time.

9 Quality of Service (QoS)
==========================

The Quality of Service (QoS) parameters should be identified together
with appropriate parameter values which set targets to be reached when
designing 3GPP specifications, and which also will serve as guidelines
for network design and service provision.

The QoS for call set-up time, as an example, can be defined in terms of
a mean value and as a percentage of cases which should not exceed a
certain time limit. Further information can be found in 3GPP TS
22.105 \[1\].

The performance requirements for the All-IP Network can be found in 3GPP
TS 22.278 \[42\].

For UE initiated QoS control OMA device management shall be the primary
method for provisioning QoS parameters.

10 Emergency Calls
==================

10.1 General requirements
-------------------------

It shall be possible to establish an emergency speech call or GTT \[26\]
call (subject to national requirements). The term \'Emergency call\'
henceforth refers to speech calls, and GTT Emergency calls if
applicable. The term \"other media\" henceforth refers to media other
than speech and GTT. Support of other media types during an emergency
call when the IM CN subsystem is used is referred to as \'IMS Multimedia
Emergency Session\' (MES) and is specified in subclause 10.4.2.
Emergency calls will be routed to the emergency services in accordance
with national regulations for where the subscriber is located. This may
be based upon one or more default emergency call numbers stored in the
ME. It shall be allowed to establish an emergency call without the need
to dial a dedicated number to avoid the mis-connection in roaming case,
such as menu, by use of a \'red button\', or a linkage to a car air bag
control. Emergency calls shall be supported by the UE without a
SIM/USIM/ISIM being present. No other type shall be accepted without a
SIM/USIM/ISIM than emergency calls and subject to operator policy and
regional regulations, restricted local operator service access.

Emergency calls shall be supported by UEs that are subject to service
restrictions, e.g. for UEs camping on a cell in a forbidden PLMN or in a
forbidden LA (see 3GPP TS 22.011 \[11\]), or on a CSG cell without the
subscriber being a member of that CSG (see 3GPP TS 22.220 \[48\]). Such
emergency calls shall be accepted by the network if required by local
regulation.

The Emergency service is required only if the UE supports voice.

Note 1: It will be left to the national authorities to decide whether
the network accepts emergency calls without the SIM/USIM/ISIM.

It shall be possible to initiate emergency calls to different emergency
call centres, depending on the type of emergency. The following types of
emergency calls shall be possible:

\- Police

\- Ambulance

\- Fire Brigade

\- Marine Guard

\- Mountain Rescue

\- Manually Initiated eCall (MIeC)

\- Automatically Initiated eCall (AIeC)

\- Spare

When a SIM/USIM is present, subscriber specific emergency call set-up
MMI shall be provided. The Home Environment operator shall specify
preferred emergency call numbers (e.g. 999 for UK citizens or 110, 118
and 119 for Japanese citizens). These emergency call numbers shall be
stored in the SIM/USIM and the ME shall read this and use any entry of
these digits to set up an emergency call. It shall be possible to store
more than one instance of this field.

Note 2: Release \'98 and earlier SIM cards have the capability to store
additional emergency call numbers. However in many cases this has not
been used.

It shall be possible to tie any emergency call number to any single
emergency call type or to any combination of emergency call types. The
association between emergency call numbers and emergency call type shall
be able to be programmed by the Home Environment operator into the
SIM/USIM.

Example:

> 19 Police (Albania)
>
> 100 Police and Fire Brigade (Greek cities)
>
> 100 Ambulance and Fire Brigade (Belgium)
>
> 112 Police and Ambulance (Italy)
>
> 112 General emergency call, all categories (Sweden)
>
> 115 Fire Brigade (Italy)
>
> 144 Ambulance (Austria)

If the UE does not recognise the emergency call numbers but the serving
network recognises the dialled number as an emergency call number used
in the country, a normal call set up shall take place over the radio
interface and after the serving network has recognised the emergency
number the call shall be routed as an emergency call.

The user friendly MMI that specifies the type of emergency call directly
(e.g. menu) should be supported for use in any (i.e. home or visited)
PLMN to avoid the mis-connection in roaming case. This shall be allowed
both with and without SIM/USIM being present.

When emergency call establishment is initiated, the emergency call type
shall be sent by the UE if it is available.

The serving network may download emergency call numbers to the UE in
order to ensure that local emergency call numbers are known to the UE.
The UE shall regard these emergency numbers as valid in that country
only (as identified by the MCC) and shall discard them when a new
country is entered.

Note 3: The UE can inform the user if the emergency call type for an
emergency number received from the serving network differs from that
configured on the USIM/SIM for the same number. How this is implemented
is outside the scope of 3GPP and takes into consideration operator
policy and regulatory requirements.

If permitted by local regulation, it shall be possible for the user to
prevent the sending of his public user identifiers and the location
information to the PSAP (i.e. emergency response centre).

Note 4: Operator policies (e.g. requirements for support of emergency
communications) may over-ride the user request for suppression.

Emergency calls over WLAN shall be supported as above with the following
caveats:

-   The UE issues an Emergency session over WLAN access to EPC only when
    3GPP access for emergency call is not possible or available (e.g. no
    3GPP coverage).

-   UEs shall only be able to establish an Emergency session over WLAN
    when the UE has been provisioned with the WLAN access parameters.

-   Service continuity for an Emergency voice call moving from 3GPP
    access CS domain to WLAN access IMS domain is not supported.

-   The level of security should not be less than that which is
    currently applied to authenticated and unauthenticated CS or IMS
    emergency calls. 

-   Emergency call numbers downloaded to the UE over WLAN from untrusted
    sources shall not be used by the UE.

NOTE 5: TS 23.402 \[57\] establishes when WLAN is trusted or not.

-   Subject to local 3GPP operator policy, the UE may use additional
    emergency call number(s) received via WLAN access for emergency
    calls via 3GPP access or WLAN access, while in the country for which
    the numbers were received.

### 10.1.1 Identification of emergency numbers

The ME shall identify an emergency number dialled by the end user as a
valid emergency number and initiate emergency call establishment if it
occurs under one or more of the following conditions. If it occurs
outside of the following conditions, the ME should not initiate
emergency call establishment but normal call establishment. Emergency
number identification takes place before and takes precedence over any
other (e.g. supplementary service related) number analysis.

a\) 112 and 911 shall always be available. These numbers shall be stored
on the ME.

b\) Any emergency call number stored on a SIM/USIM when the SIM/USIM is
present.

c\) 000, 08, 110, 999, 118 and 119 when a SIM/USIM is not present. These
numbers shall be stored on the ME.

d\) Additional emergency call numbers that may have been downloaded by
the serving network when the SIM/USIM is present.

### 10.1.2 Domains priority and selection for UE attempts to emergency call

#### 10.1.2.1 Voice and GTT only

A UE that is connected to a domain in which it is possible for the UE to
make non emergency calls using the particular media requested by the
user, shall use that domain to attempt an emergency call unless serving
network policy (based on regulatory requirements and operator needs)
requires the UE, including an unauthenticated UE, to attempt the
emergency call on a specific domain first.

If the UE is connected to more than one domain in which it is possible
for the UE to make non emergency calls using the particular media
requested by the user, the UE shall attempt an emergency call on the
same domain it would use to originate a non-emergency call using the
same media unless serving network policy (based on regulatory
requirements and operator needs) requires the UE, including an
unauthenticated UE, to attempt the emergency call on a specific domain
first.

In the case where an emergency call attempt by a UE fails, the UE should
automatically make a second attempt on the other domain if the UE
supports it.

If the user aborts the emergency call setup during the subsequent
automatic attempt and immediately tries to set up an emergency call
again, then the UE shall immediately attempt in the domain in which the
user aborted the emergency call.

#### 10.1.2.2 Other media

The following applies in addition to 10.1.2.1.

If an emergency call attempt that includes a request for both (i) voice
and/or GTT and (ii) other media cannot be supported or fails in all
connected access types in the PS CN domain, the UE shall attempt the
emergency call in the CS domain if available and shall only include the
request for voice and/or GTT.

### 10.1.3 Call-Back Requirements

Subject to local/regional regulations the network shall support a
call-back from a PSAP.

It shall be possible to supply the user\'s Directory Number/MSISDN/SIP
URI as the CLI to the PSAP to facilitate call-back. The CLI used on
call-back shall allow the PSAP to contact the same terminal that
originated the emergency call.

If the incoming call can be identified by the core network as a
call-back to an emergency call (i.e. coming from a PSAP) then
supplementary services at the terminating party shall be handled as
described in TS 22.173 \[40\] for Multimedia Telephony (e.g.
Communication Diversion, Communication Hold, Communication Barring).

Note: There is no specific callback requirement for CS supplementary
services.

A call-back may be attempted for a period of time defined by local
regulations after the emergency call release. In case of a UE in limited
service state, call-back is not required.

10.2 Emergency calls in the CS CN Domain
----------------------------------------

A CS CN Domain shall support the emergency call teleservice as defined
in 3GPP TS 22.003 \[14\] (TS12).

If a UE supports TS11(Telephony)\[14\], then it shall also support
TS12(Emergency Calls)\[14\]. It shall be possible to set up emergency
calls initiated by an emergency call number.

10.3 Emergency Calls in the PS CN Domain
----------------------------------------

Without the IM CN subsystem, emergency calls are not supported in the PS
CN domain.

10.4 Emergency calls in the IM CN subsystem
-------------------------------------------

### 10.4.1 General

The IM CN subsystem shall support IMS emergency calls. It shall be
possible to set up emergency calls initiated by an emergency call
number.

If a UE supports IMS Multimedia Telephony service with speech media as
specified in TS 22.173 \[40\] via an access network, then it shall also
support IMS emergency calls via that access network.

Subject to the regulatory requirement, the IM CN subsystem shall be able
to unambiguously identify each emergency service defined in the national
numbering plan for the country in which the UE is located.

In accordance with national regulations for where the subscriber is
located, if the UE does not recognise a dialled number as an emergency
call number but the IM CN where the subscriber is located does recognise
the dialled number as an emergency call number (e.g. a number used in
the local emergency numbering plan) then the call shall be routed as an
emergency call indicating the type of emergency service to the correct
PSAP. Subject to operator setting the call may be prioritized.

Note 1: The above does not preclude the network rejecting the call and
requesting the UE to setup a new emergency call to the same emergency
service.

The serving network may download emergency call numbers and emergency
call types, together with a validity indication of this list, for use in
the IM CN subsystem so that local emergency call numbers are made known
to the UE . Depending on the validity indication, the UE shall regard
these emergency numbers and emergency call types as valid in that
country (as identified by the MCC) and shall discard them when a new
country is entered , or the UE shall regard these emergency numbers and
emergency call types as valid in that PLMN (as identified by the MCC and
MNC) and shall discard them when the UE enters a new PLMN.

Emergency calls may be initiated using a private numbering plan \[49\].

Note 2: There can be an overlap between the private numbering plan of a
hosted enterprise and the public numbering plan, which makes translation
of emergency numbers necessary.

Emergency calls may be initiated by a service when requested by the
user.

Note 3: It is not intended to enable automatic setup of emergency calls.

Note 4: Only speech and GTT-IP \[47\] media are supported, when required
per subclause 10.1, for emergency services towards a CS PSAP.

An emergency call shall take precedence over any other services a UE may
be engaged in, if required by local regulation.

Emergency calls from an unauthenticated UE (as far as the IM CN is
concerned) shall be supported by the IM CN subsystem, if required by
local regulation.

Subject to regulatory requirements, when UEs must be authenticated, both
the network and the UE shall support the same authentication and
security methods that are used for non-emergency sessions.

### 10.4.2 IMS Multimedia Emergency Sessions

#### 10.4.2.1 General

For IMS emergency calls towards IP PSAPs, other media types may be
supported by the UE and the IMS, subject to regulatory requirements.

The media types that may be supported during an IMS MES include:

\- Real time video (simplex, full duplex), synchronized with speech if
present;

\- Session mode text-based instant messaging;

\- File transfer;

\- Video clip sharing, picture sharing, audio clip sharing;

\- Voice; and

\- Real-Time Text .

Note 1: An IMS MES need not contain voice or Real-Time Text .

To avoid interworking issues, a UE and IMS that supports text based
instant messaging shall support a common session mode text-based instant
messaging protocol.

IMS MES does not include support for legacy store and forward messaging
such as the Short Messaging Service (SMS).

Calls from non-human associated devices (e.g. fire alarms) are outside
the scope of this specification.

Adding, removing and modifying individual media to/from an IMS MES shall
be supported.

An IMS MES is not a subscription service. A UE capable of IMS emergency
calls and capable of supporting the other media types should also be
able to support initiation of an IMSMES.

An IMS MES from an unauthenticated UE (as far as the IM CN is concerned)
shall be supported by the IM CN subsystem, if required by local
regulation.

IMS MES shall be supported by UEs that are subject to service
restrictions, e.g. for UEs camping on a cell in a forbidden PLMN or in a
forbidden LA (see 3GPP TS 22.011 \[11\]), or on a CSG cell without the
subscriber being a member of that CSG (see 3GPP TS 22.220 \[48\]). Such
IMS MES shall be accepted by the network if required by local
regulation.

An IMS MES shall support providing the location of the UE, in a manner
similar to IMS emergency voice calls.

An IMS UE that supports IMS MES shall identify an emergency number
dialled by the end user as a valid emergency number utilizing the same
mechanisms as used for IMS emergency voice calls as defined in subclause
10.1.1.

Note 2: This capability supports the general public, including
facilitating emergency communications by individuals with disabilities
(e.g. persons who are deaf, deaf-blind, hard of hearing, or have a
speech disability).

An originating network and UE may support some or all of these other
media types, and support of any specific media by an originating network
or UE may be subject to regulatory requirements.

Voice call continuity per clause 21 shall be supported when a UE with an
active IMS MES with voice and other media moves out of IMS voice
coverage and voice call continuity is supported by the UE and network.
The remaining media (i.e. voice call) then becomes a CS emergency call
e.g. TS12 call for 3GPP systems as defined in 3GPP TS 22.003 \[14\].

Other media shall be dropped when a UE with an active IMS MES moves out
of IMS voice coverage, irrespective of whether or not there is an active
voice session.

#### 10.4.2.2 UE Requirements

When IMS MES are supported by the UE, the following apply:

\- An IMS UE that supports IMS MES shall also support IMS emergency
voice calls.

\- Once a UE is aware that an IMS MES has been initiated, the UE shall
be able to (subject to user configuration) avoid drawing unnecessary
attention to the user (e.g., playing audible tones or flashing brightly)
and should confirm this to the user in as private a manner as is
reasonable e.g. using text on the screen or audio if headphones are
already connected. UE behaviour in an IMS MES may need to be different
relative to the normal configuration.

\- The UE should clearly differentiate IMS emergency session-mode text
based instant messaging from IMS non-emergency session-mode text based
instant messaging on the user display.

\- The IMS UE supporting video transfer during an IMS MES should be able
to deliver recorded media in a form that allows progressive playback.
(It is desirable that all pre-recorded media sent during an emergency
session be progressively viewable.)

\- When an IP PSAP attempts to add additional media to an existing IMS
MES, the user shall be made aware of this. When additional media is
requested by the PSAP, the user shall be able to permit or deny it.

\- The UE shall provide an indication to the user for each requested
media, whether it was successfully or unsuccessfully established.

\- Further notifications of added and removed media shall be indicated
to the user while the IMS MES is active.

\- If none of the media requested by the UE is successfully established,
the IMS MES will fail and an IMS MES failure indication shall be
provided to the user.

\- In handover of an IMS MES where other media is dropped when IMS MES
is not supported, the UE shall indicate to the end user that the other
media is not supported in this area.

The following requirements for IMS emergency voice calls also apply when
an IMS MES is supported by the UE:

\- An IMS UE that supports IMS MES shall indicate to the network that
the call is an IMS emergency call as is done for an IMS emergency voice
call.

\- An IMS UE that supports IMS MES shall be able to receive an IMS
call-back from a PSAP per clause 10.1.3 with voice, GTT or other media
per clause 10.4.2.1.

\- An IMS UE that supports MES shall utilize the same trust and security
mechanisms for the other media as utilized for an IMS emergency voice
call.

\- When roaming, a UE shall originate an IMS MES in the serving network
in the same manner as for IMS emergency voice calls.

#### 10.4.2.3 Originating Network Requirements

When an IMS MES is enabled by the originating network, the following
apply:

\- Other media shall only be supported in packet-based networks that
support IMS emergency voice calls.

\- The originating network shall deliver all media to the same IP PSAP
throughout the duration of the IMS MES.

\- The network shall indicate to the UE, for each requested media,
whether it was successfully or unsuccessfully established.

\- Further notification of added and removed media shall be provided to
the UE while the IMS MES is active.

\- If none of the media requested by the UE is successfully established,
the IMS MES will fail and an IMS MES failure indication will be provided
to the UE.

The following requirements for IMS emergency voice calls also apply when
IMS MES is supported by the network:

\- Subject to regional regulatory requirements, the network shall be
able to authenticate the UE using the same procedures as for IMS
emergency voice calls.

\- The originating network shall provide the capability to enable an IMS
UE supporting IMS MES to obtain local emergency numbers or other
emergency address(es) (e.g. destination address) utilizing the same
mechanism as used for IMS emergency voice calls.

\- An IMS MES shall be provided in the local serving network.

\- For an IMS MES, any kind of emergency addressing (e.g. SIP URIs, Tel
URIs) and special indications for emergency sessions shall be treated in
the same manner as IMS emergency voice calls.

\- The originating network should detect all IMS MESs regardless of the
UE emergency call indication. According to operator policy, the
originating network may either inform the UE to enable re-origination as
an IMS MES or support origination of the initial call.

\- The originating network shall be responsible for routing the IMS MES
towards the appropriate PSAP (e.g., based on emergency service type,
location, or policy).

\- The network shall be able to provide integrity protection, and/or
privacy for other media similar to that provided for IMS emergency voice
calls.

\- An IMS MES shall utilize the same priority mechanisms as IMS
emergency voice calls.

\- Detailed log records of the IMS MES shall be generated by the
originating network in a similar manner to IMS emergency voice calls and
subject to regulatory requirements.

\- All media content within the IMS MES shall be carried with an
indication of the source, in a similar manner as for IMS emergency voice
calls.

10.6 Location Availability for Emergency Calls
----------------------------------------------

National regulations may require wireless networks to provide the
emergency caller\'s location. This requirement typically overrides the
caller\'s right to privacy with respect to their location being
revealed, but remains in effect only as long as the authorities need to
determine the caller\'s location. The interpretation of the duration of
this privacy override may also be different, subject to national
regulation. For example, some countries require location to be available
from the wireless network only while the call is up, while others may
allow PSAP\'s to unilaterally decide how long the location must be made
available.

Therefore, the requirement for providing location availability is to
allow the network to support providing a mobile caller\'s location to
the authorities for as long as required by the national regulation in
force for that network.

Note: See TS 22.071 \[44\] for location service requirements on
emergency calls.

10.7 Transfer of data during emergency calls
--------------------------------------------

Emergency calls may be supplemented with emergency related data \[1\].
Typically this data enables the accurate geographic location of a
manually or automatically activated emergency calling device e.g. an in
vehicle system (IVS), to be provided to the Public Safety Answering
Point (PSAP).

The following requirements apply to UEs designed to be able to perform
eCalls and to networks supporting eCall:

\- The data may be sent prior to, in parallel with, or at the start of
the voice component of an eCall.

\- Should the PSAP request additional data then this may be possible
during the established eCall.

\- The realisation of the transfer of data during an eCall shall
minimise changes to the originating and transit networks.

\- Both the voice and data components of the eCall shall be routed to
the same PSAP or designated emergency call centre.

\- The transmission of the data shall be acknowledged and if necessary
data shall be retransmitted.

\- The UE shall indicate at call setup if the emergency call will carry
supplementary data, i.e. is an eCall.

UEs designed to be able to perform eCalls and configured to only perform
eCalls (eCall only mode) shall comply with the following additional
requirements:

-   The UE shall not perform mobility management procedures, including
    registration on a PLMN, except when attempting to initiate and
    during an eCall, or to initiate a test or reconfiguration of the
    terminal upon request from the user.

-   For UEs that have the ability to be called back by the PSAP, the UE
    shall be capable to continue mobility management procedures for a
    limited duration following the termination of the eCall.

\- The UE shall contain an USIM application.

\- In the case where the user subscribes to other services provided by
the PLMN, it shall be possible for the network operator to reconfigure
the UE so that it can access the subscribed services.

\- It shall be possible for the user of the UE to change network
operator/service provider (i.e. to use a different USIM) or for the
subscriber to modify the existing subscription used with the UE.

\- It shall be possible for the UE upon request from the user to
initiate a call to an operator designated non-emergency MSISDN for the
purpose of accessing test and terminal reconfiguration services.

Additional national and regional requirements are as specified in Annex
A.

10.8 Supplementary service interaction during emergency calls
-------------------------------------------------------------

Supplementary services that interrupt or divert the media path between a
PSAP and the end device shall be handled as specified in TS 22.173
\[40\] (e.g. Communication Hold) for Multimedia Telephony. No such
Supplementary Services are applicable to CS Emergency Calls (TS12)
according to TS 22.004 \[5\].

11 Numbering principles
=======================

The following network addressing schemes listed below shall be supported
at the relevant domains:

\- E.164,

\- E.168,

\- E.212,

\- X.121

\- Internet (including e.g. IP address, SIP URI).

11.1 Number portability
-----------------------

### 11.1.1 Requirements for CS CN domain

Some numbering schemes shall be fully independent of the supporting
serving network and the home environment, allowing users to transfer
this number to another home environment. For further information see
3GPP TS 22.066 \[7\].

An MSISDN shall be allocated to each new user at the start of a
subscription. This number may be allocated from one of several numbering
domains. For example:

\- home / serving environment numbering scheme;

\- national numbering scheme;

\- regional numbering scheme;

\- global numbering scheme.

A user shall be able to move subscription from one home environment to
another without changing the MSISDN provided that the new home
environment offers service in the same geographic domain. It is
envisaged that home environment s will be able to allocate MSISDNs from
each of these domains as required.

### 11.1.2 Requirements for PS CN domain

None identified.

### 11.1.3 Requirements for IM CN subsystem

It shall be possible to offer number portability for E.164 numbers
within IM CN subsystem. For further information see 3GPP TS 22.066
\[7\].

11.2 Evolution path
-------------------

Since 3GPP specifications aim to be aligned with IMT-2000, a primary
goal in numbering is the provision of global user numbering in line with
steps taken by the ITU - SG2.

The numbering scheme and network implementation chosen shall allow for
international/global evolution.

11.3 Void
---------

11.4 Void
---------

11.5 Void
---------

11.6 Private numbering
----------------------

A user may wish to use private numbers for the purposes of calling
frequent numbers. Therefore there is a requirement for the use, by the
user, of Private Numbering Plans (PNPs). These schemes may belong to the
user himself, to a home environment or a third party.

11.7 Numbering schemes
----------------------

### 11.7.1 Multiple numbering scheme

The standards shall support the possibility of allowing the bearer
service associated with an MT call to be implicitly defined by the
destination MSISDN, for example to use a different MSISDN to establish
voice, fax or data . It will be possible for multiple MSISDNs to be
associated with a single subscription.

### 11.7.2 Single numbering scheme

The standards shall support the possibility of allowing MT calls of
different bearer types ( e.g. voice, fax, data) to be routed to a single
MSISDN. It is recognised that the implementation of this may depend on
the availability of bearer information associated with an incoming call
from the adjoining transit network. In particular the standards will
support this possibility in the case of an adjoining ISDN transit
network.

### 11.7.3 Additional numbers

The 3GPP system shall support the possibility to assign an additional
MSISDN, in addition to the original MSISDN, to a user with a connection
to the PS CN domain. If this additional MSISDN is available it shall be
used for correlation of CS and IMS in voice call and service continuity
as well as IMS Centralized Service. In this case the original MSISDN may
be used for charging and OA&M purposes and forwarded to the PS gateway
to other packet data networks.

11.8 Optimal routing {#optimal-routing .list-paragraph}
--------------------

The implementation of the numbering scheme used shall allow for optimal
routing; i.e. routing shall not take place simply on the number dialled.

See 3GPP TS 22.079 \[8\] for some scenarios for the CS CN domain.
Optimal routing for IP services is supported by the All-IP Network
\[42\].

11a Identification Requirements
===============================

11a.1 Subscriber Identification
-------------------------------

In 3GPP the identity of a subscriber is encoded in a identity module
application which is contained on a UICC or on a GSM SIM card. The UICC
or GSM SIM card is a removable component of the User Equipment. Three
types of identity modules are used in the 3GPP system:

\- Universal Subscriber Identity Module (USIM)

\- IMS Subscriber Identity Module (ISIM)

\- Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) according to GSM

General requirements:

\- In the 3GPP system each subscriber shall be uniquely identifiable.

\- The serving networks shall be able to authenticate any subscriber
that roams onto their network

\- If a UE, that is registered on the serving network, contains a GSM
SIM card or a UICC containing a identity module application, the serving
network shall be able to identify the associated home PLMN.

Note 1: UE support of GSM SIM is optional.

Note 2: See the chapter (USIM, UICC and Terminal) of the present
specification for a reference, which GSM phase SIMs need to be supported
by the network.

11a.2 Terminal Identification
-----------------------------

It is a requirement that the terminal can be uniquely identified by the
home environment and serving network. This shall require a terminal
identity scheme which uniquely identifies each terminal, see 3GPP TS
22.016\[12\].

11a.3 Home Environment / Serving Network Identification
-------------------------------------------------------

Home / serving environments need to route communication to the current
location of the user. This shall require a identity scheme which
uniquely identifies the serving environment and shall be used for
routing purposes.

11a.4 Serving Environment / Mobile Virtual Network Identification
-----------------------------------------------------------------

A mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) is a service provider that does
not have its own radio access network, but resells wireless services,
typically under their own brand name, using the network of a host PLMN
operator.

It should be possible to uniquely identify subscribers belonging to a
particular MVNO.

12 Human Factors and user procedures
====================================

The User Interface (MMI) from the end-user\'s point of view should be as
flexible as possible while still meeting the general service
requirements. In addition it should be capable of being updated so as to
meet new services which are still to be envisaged.

In general the following principles should be encompassed:

\- activation of services should be as simple as possible with minimum
input expected from the user;

\- feedback, to the user from the various services, should be
meaningful;

\- any error recovery procedures provided should be simple to understand
and execute.

\- input from the user and information to the user should be provided in
alternative selectable modes in order to match user capabilities,
preferences and situation.

However, a detailed specification for the User Interface shall not be
defined. In particular given the global nature of the third generation
systems, for different regions of the world, different criteria will
determine the implementation of the User Interface. Also it is unlikely
that there will be a single common handset which will meet all the
service requirements and therefore a common User Interface would be
impractical.

Given the flexibility of the services, there should be a wide range of
User Interface possibilities. These possibilities include simple
terminals with a single on/off button through to complex terminals
providing support to hearing/visually impaired users.

Control of CS CN Domain supplementary services (3GPP TS 22.004 \[5\]),
may use MMI procedures specified in 3GPP TS 22.030 \[6\] and existing
MMI related UE features (Annex A) may also be used. In particular the
following features are highly desirable for uniform UE implementation
where appropriate:

\- Mapping of numeric keys to European alphabetic keys to ensure
compatible mnemonic dialing as defined in 3GPP TS 22.030 \[6\],

\- \"+\" key function to enable one key international access as defined
in Annex A

\- Structure of the MMI as described in 3GPP TS 22.030 \[6\]

\- Presentation of IMEI (International Mobile Equipment Identity) as
defined in 3GPP TS 22.030 \[6\].

13 UICC, USIM and Terminal
==========================

This clause defines the functional characteristics and requirements of
the User Service Identity Module (USIM) and ISIM (IM Services Identity
Module). The USIM/ISIM are applications residing on a UICC.

13.1 The USIM/ISIM and User Profiles
------------------------------------

### 13.1.1 The USIM

Every USIM shall have a unique identity and shall be associated with one
and only one home environment.

It shall be possible for a home environment to uniquely identify a user
by the USIM.

The USIM shall be used to provide security features.

For access to services, provided by PS or CS CN domains, a valid USIM
shall be required. Optionally, SIM according to GSM phase 2, GSM phase
2+, 3GPP release 99, 3GPP release 4 specifications may be supported.

The USIM shall be able to support SIM Application Toolkit as specified
in 3GPP TS 22.038 \[3\].

The USIM shall reside on a UICC. USIM specific information shall be
protected against unauthorised access or alteration.

It shall be possible to update USIM specific information via the air
interface, in a secure manner.

Access to the IMS services shall be possible using the USIM application
in the event of no ISIM being present on the UICC. If an ISIM is present
on the UICC it shall be used to access the IMS.

It shall be possible to store provisioning parameters on the USIM
according to DM specifications \[37\].

It should be possible to store provisioning parameters on the USIM
according to CP specifications \[38\].

It shall be possible for the network operator to configure the USIM to
indicate (through personalisation and OTA) whether provisioning
parameters according to DM specifications or provisioning parameters
according to CP specifications shall be used.

Note: To avoid misoperation of the UE in a mixed provisioning
environment e.g. during a transition phase when both CP and DM clients
are present in the UE, the CP parameters on the USIM can be read first.
If DMinformation is present (provisioned OTA in the CP parameters.),
then use DM, otherwise use CP.

Annex A describes a number of features that may optionally be supported
by the UE and thus USIM.

### 13.1.2 User Profiles

It shall be possible for a user to be associated with one or a number of
user profiles, which the user can select and activate on a per call
basis. The user profile contains information which may be used to
personalise services for the user.

It shall be possible for one or more user profiles associated with the
same user to be active simultaneously so that the user may make or
receive calls associated with different profiles simultaneously.
Activation of profiles shall be done in a secure manner, for example
with the use of a PIN.

For terminating calls the correct profile shall be indicated by the user
address used (e.g. MSISDN, SIP URI), each profile will have at least one
unique user address associated with it. For originating calls the user
shall be able to choose from the available profiles, the appropriate one
for the call. A profile identity will need to be associated with the
call for accounting and billing purposes. User profile identities need
not be standardised but a standardised means is required for indicating
that a particular profile is being used.

Simultaneous use of the same user profile on multiple terminals for the
same type of service shall not be allowed.

User profiles associated with different home environments shall not
share the same user address.

### 13.1.3 UICC usage in GERAN only Terminals

In Release 5 and later, terminals supporting only GERAN shall support
USIM.

Note: It is strongly recommended that manufacturers implement SIM
support on GERAN only terminals until the population of SIMs in the
market is reduced to a low level.

### 13.1.4 Multiple USIMs per UICC

The standard shall support more than one USIM per UICC even when those
USIMs are associated with different home environments. Only one of the
USIMs or the SIM shall be active at a given time. While the UE is in
idle mode, it shall be possible for the user to select/reselect one USIM
application amongst those available on the UICC. At switch on, the Last
Active USIM shall be automatically selected. The Last Active USIM shall
be stored on the UICC. By default if there is no Last Active USIM
defined in the UICC, the user shall be able to select the active USIM
amongst those available on the UICC.

The standard must not prevent the coexistence of USIM applications, each
associated with different home environments on the same UICC, so long as
the security problems which arise from such a coexistence are solved.

### 13.1.5 The ISIM

Access to the IMS services shall be possible using an ISIM application.

The ISIM shall be sufficient for providing the necessary security
features for the IMS and IMS only.

The ISIM shall reside on a UICC. ISIM specific information shall be
protected against unauthorised access or alteration.

It shall be possible to update ISIM specific information via the air
interface, in a secure manner.

Note: When accessing IMS over GERAN/UTRAN/EUTRAN or I-WLAN using ISIM, a
USIM needs also be present to access the rest of the 3GPP system.
Alternatively USIM could be used to access IMS.

13.2 The UICC
-------------

**Characteristics including physical formats of a UICC are defined in TS
31.101\[36\].**

Access to services via 3GPP system with a single UICC shall be possible.

### 13.2.1 The UICC and Applications other than the USIM or ISIM

It shall be possible for the UICC to host other applications in addition
to the USIM or ISIM, see figure 3. Service providers, subscribers or
users may need to establish additional data or processes on the UICC.
Each application on an UICC shall reside in its own domain (physical or
logical). It shall be possible to manage each application on the card
separately. The security and operation of an application in any domain
shall not be compromised by an application running in a different
domain. Applications may need to use their own security mechanisms which
are separate to those specified by 3GPP e.g. electronic commerce
applications.

Examples of UICC applications are: USIM, ISIM, off-line user
applications like UPT, electronic banking, credit service, etc.

Applications should be able to share some information such as a common
address book.

It shall be possible to address applications, which reside on the UICC,
via the air interface.

Figure 3 Example of a Multifunction UICC

### 13.2.1a UICC applications and IMS

UICC applications may make use of IMS functionalities controlled by ME.

Note: This is to allow a UICC application to interact with an
Application Server (AS) through IMS. Examples of UICC applications
include identity management, banking applications, etc.

### 13.2.2 Fast Access and Retrieval of Data from UICC

An optional \"high speed\" interface may be provided between the UICC
and the ME.

If provided, this interface shall allow fast access and retrieval of
data to support functionalities requiring large amounts of data to be
transferred to and from the UICC. Examples include:

\- on-card web servers

\- rapid access to data stored on the UICC, e.g. phone book, PLMN lists
or user data

A UICC/ME interface supporting this \"high speed\" interface shall be
backward compatible with the TS 102 221 interface specified in 3GPP TS
31.101 \[36\].

13.3 Terminals and Multiple UICCs
---------------------------------

A single terminal may support the use of multiple UICC (e.g. with
applications like USIM and/or banking, credit card,\...). Only one UICC
shall be active at a time to access a PLMN. In case the active UICC
contains more than one USIM, the requirements of 13.1.4 shall apply.

If the UICC with the active USIM is removed from the mobile terminal
during a call (except for emergency calls), the call shall be terminated
immediately. If the UICC with an active ISIM is removed during an IMS
session the IMS session shall be terminated.

14 Types of features of UEs
===========================

3GPP specifications should support a wide variety of user equipment,
i.e. setting any limitations on terminals should be avoided as much as
possible. For example user equipment like hand-portable phones, personal
digital assistants and laptop computers can clearly be seen as likely
terminals.

In order not to limit the possible types of user equipment they are not
standardised. The UE types could be categorised by their service
capabilities rather than by their physical characteristics. Typical
examples are speech only UE, narrowband data UE, wideband data UE, data
and speech UE, etc..

In order to enhance functionality split and modularity inside the user
equipment the interfaces of UE should be identified. Interfaces like
UICC-interface, PCMCIA-interface and other PC-interfaces, including
software interfaces, should be covered by references to the applicable
interface standards.

UEs have to be capable of supporting a wide variety of teleservices,
multimedia services and applications provided in PLMN environment.
Limitations may exist on UEs capability to support all possible
teleservices, multimedia services and information types (speech,
narrowband data, wideband data, video, etc.) and therefore functionality
to indicate capabilities of a UE shall be specified.

The basic mandatory UE requirements are:

\- Support for USIM. Optional support of GSM phase 2, 2+, 3GPP Release
99 and Release 4 SIM cards \[34\]. Phase 1, 5V SIM cards shall not be
supported. Support for the SIM/ISIM is optional for the UE, however, if
it is supported, the mandatory requirements for SIM/ISIM shall be
supported in the UE;

Note 1: There is no Release 5 specification for the SIM, and therefore
references to \"SIM\" apply to earlier releases.

Note 2: It is strongly recommended that manufacturers implement SIM
support on terminals supporting GERAN until the population of SIMs in
the market is reduced to a low level.

\- Home environment and serving network registration and deregistration;

\- Location update;

\- Originating or receiving a connection oriented or a connectionless
service;

\- An unalterable equipment identification; IMEI, see 3GPP TS 22.016
\[12\];

\- Basic identification of the terminal capabilities related to services
such as; the support for software downloading, application execution
environment/interface, MExE terminal class, supported bearer services.

\- Terminals capable for emergency calls shall support emergency call
without a SIM/USIM/ISIM.

\- Support for the execution of algorithms required for encryption, for
CS and PS services. Support for non encrypted mode is required;

\- Support for the method of handling automatic calling repeat attempt
restrictions as specified in 3GPP TS 22.001 \[4\];

\- At least one capability type shall be standardised for mobile
terminals supporting the GERAN,UTRAN and E-UTRAN radio interfaces.

\- Under emergency situations, it may be desirable for the operator to
prevent UE users from making access attempts (including emergency call
attempts) or responding to pages in specified areas of a network, see
3GPP TS 22.011 \[11\];

\- Ciphering Indicator for terminals with a suitable display;

\- The ciphering indicator feature allows the UE to detect that the 3GPP
radio interface ciphering (user plane) is not switched on and to
indicate this to the user. The ciphering indicator feature may be
disabled by the home network operator setting data in the SIM/USIM. The
default terminal behaviour shall be to take into account the operator
setting data in the SIM/USIM. However, terminals with a user interface
that can allow it, shall offer the possibility for the user to configure
the terminal to ignore the operator setting data in the SIM/USIM. If
this feature is not disabled by the SIM/USIM or if the terminal has been
configured to ignore the operator setting data in the SIM/USIM, then
whenever a user plane connection is in place, which is, or becomes
un-enciphered, an indication shall be given to the user. In addition, if
this feature is not disabled by the SIM/USIM or if the terminal has been
configured to ignore the operator setting data in the SIM/USIM, then
additional information may also be provided about the status of the
ciphering. Ciphering itself is unaffected by this feature, and the user
can choose how to proceed;

\- Support for PLMN selection.

\- Support for handling of interactions between toolkits concerning the
access to UE MMI input/output capabilities;

\- Whenever an application (e.g. a SAT/MExE/WAP application) requires
the access to the UE MMI input/output capabilities (e.g. display,
keyboard,... ), the UE shall grant this access subject to the
capabilities of the UE. This shall not cause the termination of any
other applications (e.g. WAP browser or MExE/SAT application) which were
previously using these UE resources. The UE shall give the user the
ability to accept or reject the new application. In the case that the
application request is rejected, the access to the UE MMI input/output
capabilities is returned to the applications which were previously using
these UE resources. If the user decides to continue with the new
application, then when this new application is terminated, the access to
the UE MMI input/output capabilities shall be returned to the UE to be
re-allocated to applications (e.g. the preceding application which was
interrupted). Subject to the capabilities of the UE, the user shall have
the ability to switch the MMI input/output capabilities between
applications.

Note: Rejecting a request to access the UE MMI input/output capabilities
by an application does not necessarily mean that it is terminated, but
only that the access to the UE MMI input/output capabilities are not
granted to this application. Handling of rejection (termination, put on
hold,...) is the responsibility of the application.

Annex A describes a number of features which may optionally be supported
by the UE.

15 Relationship between subscription and service delivery
=========================================================

15.1 Subscription
-----------------

A subscription describes the commercial relationship between the
subscriber and the service provider.

Figure 4: Subscriber, subscription and services relationship

A subscription to a network operator may provide the user with access to
one or more domains. A Subscription shall identify the set of services,
within particular domains, to which the user has access (see figure 3);
each subscription may specify a different set of services. These
services may be provided by the CS CN Domain and/or a PS CN Domain
and/or an IM CN subsystem. Subscriptions relate to services such as
Basic Services (e.g. Teleservices, Bearer services), PS services and
IM-Services (IP-based multimedia services), which are typically provided
by network operators, and to value added services which typically are
provided by network operators and/or other entities that provide
services to a subscriber

The subscription identifies:

\- the services and related services information that are made available
to the subscriber by the service provider ;

In addition a subscription to a network operator may identify:

\- the domains to which the user has been granted access by the network
operator. In particular, the PS service profile and information on the
allowed QoS parameter ranges shall be contained in the subscription.

\- the identity of the subscriber within these domains.\
Note: The identity of a subscriber in the CS CN domain and PS CN domain
(e.g. her IMSI) may potentially be different to her identity in the IM
CN subsystem

\- the radio access systems over which the subscriber may access their
services e.g. UTRAN, GERAN, EUTRAN, I-WLAN.

15.2 Other concepts associated with services
--------------------------------------------

**Provision of services:**\
An action to make a service available to a subscriber. The provision may
be:

-   general: where the service is made available to all subscribers
    (subject to compatibility restrictions enforced) without prior
    arrangements being made with the service provider;

-   pre‑arranged: where the service is made available to an individual
    subscriber only after the necessary arrangements have been made with
    the service provider.

**Withdrawal:\
**An action taken by the service provider to remove an available service
from a subscriber\'s access. The withdrawal may be:

-   general: where the service is removed from all subscribers provided
    with the service;

-   specific: where the service is removed on an individual basis from
    subscribers provided with the service.

Note: Access to the IM subsystem requires IP connectivity provided, for
example, through provision of the PS CN domain.

15.3 Requirements concerning service delivery
---------------------------------------------

In general it is a requirement to allow the use of independent services
simultaneously (i.e. Basic, PS, IP multimedia and operator specific).

1\) The network usage shall be based on the services identified within
the subscription, the terminal capabilities and, where applicable,
roaming agreements between operators.

2\) The Home environment shall be able to decide on the service delivery
in a roaming scenario. I.e. it shall control how services are delivered
in line with the subscription.

3\) If an offered or required service (e.g. voice) could be provided
with different technologies within the serving network, the decision on
service delivery shall be based on preferences identified in the user
profile and serving network capabilities and conditions (e.g. load).

4\) If the user profile does not allow an alternative service delivery
method and the requested delivery method is not available in the serving
network the service shall not be provided to the subscriber. This
applies also to data bearer services with defined QoS parameters (or
parameter ranges).

Examples:

\- A terminating voice call for a subscriber with a dual/multi mode
terminal (e.g. UTRAN/GERAN) could be delivered in a hybrid network as IM
service or CS voice call (TS11). The delivery decision is based on the
preferences of service delivery within the user profile and the network
conditions. If there is no preference information of the Home
environment available the decision is made only on the network
conditions from the serving network.

\- A terminating data service (e.g. PS with QoS for real time audio)
where the network cannot provide the QoS at call setup. Both the
originating and terminating application shall be informed about the
possible QoS configuration for that call. The further handling (setup
continuation, termination) depends on the decisions of the applications.

### 15.3.1 Mobile Originated Voice calls

When a ME capable of offering voice service both on CS and IMS is CS
attached and IMS registered MO CS Voice calls (TS11) and MO IMS voice
services shall be originated on the domain specified by the Home
operator policy or users preferences. The Home Operator policy shall
have precedence to user preferences.

### 15.3.2 Mobile Terminated Voice calls

When a ME capable of offering voice service both on CS and IMS, MT CS
Voice calls (TS11) and MT IMS voice services shall be delivered over the
domain specified by the Home operator policy or users preferences. The
Home Operator policy shall have precedence to user preferences. If the
call delivery attempt fails in one domain, if specified by operator
policy, it should be possible to attempt the delivery in the other
domain or the call/communication forwarding supplementary services \[41,
40\] may be invoked if provisioned.

NOTE 1: The delivery decision will take into account aspects such as IMS
registration and CS attachment status.

NOTE 2: When the terminating network knows that the UE is either IMS
registered or CS attached in non-3GPP access (e.g. CDMA), the delivery
decision will take this into account in order to select the correct
domain.

16 Charging principles
======================

The cost of the call may cover the cost of sending, transporting,
delivery and storage. The cost of call related signalling may also be
included. Provision shall be made for charging based on time,
destination, location, volume, bandwidth, access technology and quality.
Charges may also be levied as a result of the use of value added
services.

It shall be possible for information relating to chargeable events to be
made available to the home environment at short notice. The requirements
shall include:

\- Immediately after a chargeable event is completed;

\- At regular intervals of time, volume or charge during a chargeable
event.

1.  \- Delivery of the location of the terminal to the home environment,
    > e.g. cell identification;

Standardised mechanisms of transferring charging information are
required to make these requirements possible.

It should be possible for multiple leg calls (e.g. forwarded, conference
or roamed) to be charged to each party as if each leg was separately
initiated. However, in certain types of call, the originating party may
wish/be obliged to pay for other legs (e.g. SMS MO may also pay for the
MT leg.).

It shall be possible to charge according to the location (e.g. cell, or
zone) and access technology that are being used to access network
services.

Provision shall be made for the chargeable party to be changed during
the life of the call. There shall be a flexible billing mechanism which
may include the use of stored value cards, credit cards or similar
devices.

The chargeable party (normally the calling party) shall be provided with
an indication of the charges to be levied (e.g. via the called number
automatically or the Advice of Charge supplementary service) for the
duration of the call (even though the user may change service
environment)The user shall be able to make decisions about the
acceptable level of accumulated charge dynamically or through their
service profile.

If a user is to be charged for accepting a call then their consent
should be obtained. This may be done dynamically or through their
service profile.

Charging and accounting solutions shall support the shared network
architecture so that end users can be appropriately charged for their
usage of the shared network, and network sharing partners can be
allocated their share of the costs of the shared network resources.

17 Roaming
==========

17.1 Assumptions
----------------

In order to roam, the following applies:

\- Mobile terminal can connect to the radio access network.

\- Authentication (charging/billing network) must occur in order to get
access to services (except for emergency calls).

\- The services offered to a roaming subscriber may be restricted by the
capabilities of the visited network, and the roaming agreement between
the visited and the home environment.

17.2 Principle
--------------

Long term evolution of the IM CN subsystem shall not be restricted by
the short/mid-term inter-domain roaming requirements.

17.3 Requirements
-----------------

Figure 5: Roaming requirements

\- The personalised services & capabilities available in a visited
network are dependent upon the subscription options in the home
environment. This does not preclude the visited network offering
additional services, or access to content providers.

\- Roaming from this release\'s home environment to CS (this release or
earlier) visited network is required

\- Roaming from this release\'s home environment to IM CN subsystem
visited network is required

\- Roaming from this release\'s home environment to PS (this release or
earlier) visited network is required

\- Roaming from previous releases\' home environment (or earlier) to
this release CS visited network is required

\- Roaming from previous releases\' home environment (or earlier) to
this release PS visited network is required

Note: When an operator allows a subscriber to roam to different domains,
the home environment needs to provide subscription data to the visited
network . The mapping between service data of the different domains is
not standardised; it is determined by the home environment and may be
influenced by roaming agreements.

18 Handover Requirements
========================

Any handover required to maintain an active service while a user is
mobile within the coverage area of a given network, shall be seamless
from the user\'s perspective. However handovers that occur between
different radio environments may result in a change of the quality of
service experienced by the user.

It shall be possible for users to be handed over between different
networks subject to appropriate roaming/commercial agreements.

For further information see 3GPP TS 22.129 \[9\].

19 Network Selection
====================

Network selection procedures are defined in 3GPP TS 22.011 \[11\].

Other procedures may be offered by the UE.

20 Security
===========

Security matters are considered in 3GPP TS 21.133 \[15\] and 3GPP TS
33.120 \[16\].

21 Voice Call Continuity
========================

21.1 General
------------

The 3GPP system shall be able to provide continuity between CS voice
services (Teleservice 11\[14\]) and the full duplex speech component of
IMS multimedia telephony service \[40\] with no negative impact upon the
user\'s experience of the voice service. This functionality is known as
voice call continuity. Voice call continuity shall be executed when
continuation of a voice service is required based on operator policy
across a change in the connection of the UE to the 3GPP system as the
user moves from using the CS domain to using IMS and vice versa.

The user experience shall be unaffected by the transition from a CS
voice service to a full duplex speech component of IMS multimedia
telephony and vice versa, and the user shall experience no disruption in
the voice service provided. The voice service is continued with the same
ME.

It shall be possible to support Voice call continuity between IMS and
the CS domain belonging to different operators; i.e., when the user\'s
IMS services are under the control of the home IMS and the user is
roaming in the coverage of the visited CS network.

It shall be possible for an operator to enable or disable Voice call
continuity for a given subscriber e.g. based on roaming conditions,
terminal capabilities.

21.2 Support of Supplementary Services
--------------------------------------

The voice call continuity user\'s experience shall be such that, to the
greatest degree possible, a consistency of service is provided
regardless of the underlying communication infrastructure and
technology. With regard to supplementary services, the general principle
is that CS-based supplementary services only apply whilst a VCC
subscriber is in the CS domain and equivalent services over IMS only
apply whilst a VCC subscriber is in the IMS domain, although there are
exceptions listed below. It is not required to synchronise the
supplementary service settings of the CS domain with the related service
settings of the IMS (e.g. different forwarding numbers may apply over CS
and over IMS).

The following supplementary services apply. The impact on the
supplementary services in case the VCC is executed for the calling
party, the called party, or both is described below.

### 21.2.1 Line Identification Services

A user who has subscribed to the CLIP Supplementary Service and receives
a call shall also receive the line identity or appropriate IMS
information of the calling party.

The identity presentation is not changed for the duration of the call
regardless of whether the call undergoes VCC.

If the CLIR Supplementary Service or IMS identity restriction is
applicable to the call, then at call setup time the called user shall
receive an indication that the identity is not available because of
restriction.

The indication is not changed for the duration of the call regardless of
whether the call undergoes VCC.

If COLP or a corresponding IMS service is applicable to a call the
calling subscriber shall receive the connected line identity or
appropriate IMS information at call setup time.

The identity presentation is not changed for the duration of the call
regardless of whether the call undergoes VCC.

If the COLR Supplementary Service or IMS identity restriction is
applicable to the call, then the calling user shall receive an
indication at call setup time that the identity of the connected party
is not available because of restriction.

The indication is not changed for the duration of the call regardless of
whether the call undergoes VCC.

### 21.2.2 All Call Forwardings

It shall be possible to perform VCC on a call which was forwarded due to
call forwarding supplementary services in the CS or redirecting services
in the IMS.

### 21.2.3 Call Waiting

The functionality of call waiting supplementary service in the CS domain
shall not be affected by the user\'s ability to undergo VCC.

Note: Whether the user will continue to receive call waiting
notifications in the case their call is continued in the IMS will depend
on whether a call waiting service is available in the IMS.

### 21.2.4 Call Hold

It shall be possible to re-establish a call which has been put on hold
before undergoing VCC, after the VCC has been performed.

### 21.2.5 Multiparty

It shall be possible for any party in a multiparty call to undergo VCC
and to stay in the call. It shall be possible to terminate the entire
multiparty call when the served mobile subscriber releases even if she
is connected via the IMS after undergoing VCC.

### 21.2.6 All Call Barrings

If a call were to undergo VCC and that would result in the call being
barred in the target domain/system, it shall be up to the home operator
policy whether the call continues in the target domain/system, the call
terminates, or VCC is not executed for the call.

### 21.2.7 Void

### 21.2.8 Void

### 21.2.9 All other Supplementary Services

Other supplementary services are not discussed in this section as they
do not apply to calls in progress (i.e. they apply to call set up only)
or their support and/or the need for standardised implementation has not
been identified as critical for VCC in this Release.

21.3 Quality of Service
-----------------------

Voice call continuity shall not adversely impact the quality of the
voice service experienced by the user.

21.4 Security
-------------

Voice call continuity shall not adversely impact the security of the
3GPP system.

Security mechanisms of the 3GPP system shall be reused for voice call
continuity.

21.5 Emergency calls
--------------------

Voice call continuity for emergency calls shall be applicable to dual
radio and single radio UEs.

Voice call continuity of emergency calls shall only be performed when
all the following conditions are met:

\- the source network is IMS;

\- the target network supports emergency calls;

\- the user is moving out of coverage;

\- the source and target network belong to the same operator;

\- the target network supports voice call continuity.

21.6 Charging
-------------

It shall be possible to indicate in the charging information that a VCC
event has occurred (e.g., so that appropriate ratings can be applied for
the CS and IMS parts of the continued voice call).

21.7 VCC Activation
-------------------

It shall be possible to activate VCC based on operator policies, taking
into account any of the following:

\- Radio conditions e.g. radio quality thresholds and related hysteresis

\- Coverage availability e.g.: Always prefer I-WLAN, if certain SSID are
available

22 IMS Centralized Services
===========================

22.1 General
------------

The ICS user shall receive both registered and unregistered services in
a consistent manner when the user accesses IMS either via the CS or the
PS domain (both of which can be supported by 3GPP access networks or
non‑3GPP access networks). Support of UEs enhanced with ICS capability
as well as UEs without ICS capability shall be possible.

Note: The impacts to support non-3GPP CS domains to support of ICS are
outside the scope of 3GPP.

22.2 Service Consistency
------------------------

Subscribers shall have a consistent user experience regardless of the
domain used, subject to the constraints of the UE and access network.

22.3 Service Continuity
-----------------------

ICS shall support service continuity between CS and PS domains (both of
which can be supported by 3GPP access networks or non‑3GPP access
networks), subject to the constraints of the UE and access networks.

Note : The impacts to support non 3GPP CS domains are outside the scope
of 3GPP.

The service continuity shall include:

\- Basic services

\- Non mid-call services

\- Mid-call services

The support of service continuity for fax and data (CS) media components
is not required.

22.4 IMS Services
-----------------

The set of IMS services supported by ICS shall include at least the
following, subject to the constraints of the UE and access networks:

\- IMS Multimedia Telephony services, including:

\- speech,

\- video,

\- fax,

\- data (CS),

\- Supplementary services defined within \[40\]; and

\- Multimedia priority service.

\- IMS emergency calls, including eCall.

Note: Other IMS hosted services supported by an operator or 3rd party
may be supported.

22.5 Roaming Support
--------------------

An ICS user shall be able to receive full ICS support from the HPLMN
while roaming in the VPLMN, subject to the constraints of the VPLMN
(e.g. roaming agreements, operator policies).

The Home operator shall be able to control if the UE enhanced with ICS
capability shall act without ICS capability while roaming.

23 CS IP interconnection requirements
=====================================

23.1 Introduction
-----------------

CS IP interconnect represents the interconnection of MSC Server
functionality between 2 CS networks over an underlying IP
infrastructure.

23.2 IP interconnect
--------------------

The IP connection used for CS IP interconnect shall be generic such that
it can support all combinations of core network interconnection. E.g.
the IP interconnection shall be shared between the IMS interconnection
and the CS IP interconnection.

It shall be possible to handle the inter-connection of all services over
this generic IP interface. The handling of security and charging shall
also be generic for all IP interconnect scenarios.

23.3 MSC server interconnect
----------------------------

The following requirements apply at the interconnection point when two
PLMNs are interconnected by means of IP transport technology for 2G and
3G CS services.

The system shall support the capability for CS service interoperability
and interworking.

It shall be possible to apply operator defined policy at the
interconnection point.

The system shall support the capability to control the session resources
when two different network domains are connected that may have, for
example, different IP addressing schemes.

The system shall support IP inter-connection between core networks
either by direct connection or by using an intermediate carrier (e.g.
GSMA IPX \[43\]).

The system shall support both bilateral interconnection between two
carriers and multilateral interconnection (e.g. GSMA IPX \[43\]) by
means of intermediate carrier.

The system shall support either

\- transparent relay of the IP signalling and traffic;

\- service aware interconnection

The system shall support codec negotiation across one or multiple
interconnects to minimise transcoding (and preferably eliminate it) to
provide the highest quality service to the user.

24 Service Alignment & Migration
================================

24.1 Introduction
-----------------

Services can be offered to the users via different service domains, e.g.
certain teleservices and supplementary services via CS or Multimedia
Telephony and supplementary services via IMS. Especially for the
supplementary services given below a strong relationship exists from the
user\'s point of view. Therefore means shall be provided to enable a
consistent user experience when changing from one service domain to the
other.

The requirements in this clause are applicable during the migration to
an ICS. The ability to synchronise the service settings will facilitate
the migration from a CS to an IMS based network and will allow network
operators maximum flexibility in their migration strategies.

24.2 Alignment of supplementary services settings
-------------------------------------------------

Based on user preferences and if provisioned by the home operator the
network shall automatically synchronise the parameter settings of the
supplementary services listed in the following table:

Table 24.2-1: Alignment of supplementary services settings

  ---------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  CS Voice (TS11) Supplementary Services   Equivalent Multimedia Telephony Services in IMS domain   Service Behaviour Required
  CLIP/CLIR                                OIP/OIR                                                  Consistency of presentation
  CoLP/CoLR                                TIP/TIR                                                  Consistency of presentation
  CNAP                                     OIP/OIR                                                  Consistency of presentation
  Call Forwarding                          CDIV                                                     Call forwarding/CDIV shall work consistently no matter which domain the user is in. The settings (e.g. forwarding numbers) shall remain the same across domains for all the parts of the service for which there is an equivalent.
  Call Waiting                             Communication Waiting                                    The busy state of the user shall be available to both domains so that this can be applied no matter from which domain an incoming call/communication originates. The activation status of Call Waiting and Communication Waiting shall be synchronised.
  Call Hold                                Communication HOLD                                       Any calls held in one domain shall remain held on moving to a different domain. It shall be possible to re-establish a call that was put on hold in another domain.
  Multiparty                               CONF                                                     Any conference (multiparty) calls set up in one domain shall remain in force if any user moves to another domain.
  Closed User Group                        Closed User Group                                        Consistency required across domains
  CCBS                                     CCBS                                                     Consistency required across domains
  Call Deflection                          Defined in CDIV                                          Consistency required across domains
  Explicit Call Transfer                   ECommT                                                   Consistency required across domains. The UE state (i.e. if busy or not) shall be available in both domains to ensure that this can be applied consistently.
  Call Barring                             Communication Barring                                    Call/ Communication Barring shall work consistently no matter which domain the user is in. The settings (i.e. barred numbers) shall remain the same across domains.
  AoC                                      AoC                                                      Consistent support across domains. If the user moves from one domain to the other during the communication, the AoC shall indicate the correct charge for the total duration of the communication.
  ---------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The operator shall be able to provision the user with the possibility to
define which of the above settings shall be synchronised automatically
and which settings can exist independently of each other. E.g. a user
might decide that the activation status of CLIP/OIP, CLIR/OIR, Call
Waiting/Communication Waiting etc. is synchronised but that the call
forwarding status and forwarded-to-number is different from the
communication diversion settings and the diverted-to-party address.

If the synchronisation of supplementary services, which use the UE\'s
busy state for invocation, is activated the busy state of the UE shall
be available in both domains.

Note: The \"user not reachable\" or \"user not logged in\" conditions in
the different domains are independent of each other. This means, e.g.
not being registered in the IMS does not affect the invocation of CFNRc
in the CS domain.

Synchronisation of settings means that the most recent changes which
have been applied in one domain are propagated to the other domain.

There are certain circumstances under which the synchronisation will
fail e.g. when a user inserts a SIP URI as diverted-to-party address in
the IMS domain which has no Tel URI associated with it. In such a case
there is no valid setting for the CS domain for this particular
parameter and therefore the CS domain service setting shall remain
unchanged. The user may receive a notification about the failure of the
synchronisation procedure and its cause.

25 System optimisation for communication with specific characteristics
======================================================================

25.1 Void
---------

25.2 Numbering Resource Efficiency
----------------------------------

The following optional requirement is intended to provide better
numbering resource efficiency for UEs that only require packet switched
services.

\- A network operator shall be able to provide PS only subscriptions
with or without assigning an MSISDN.

\- Remote triggering shall be supported with or without assigning an
MSISDN.

\- Remote UE configuration shall be supported without the use of an
MSISDN.

Note 1: Current remote UE configuration solutions (i.e. Device
Management and Over-the-Air configuration) are mainly based on SMS,
which assumes the use of MSISDNs.

Note 2: The requirements in this sub-clause apply to server-to-UE
communication scenarios only.

25.3 Network provided destination for uplink data
-------------------------------------------------

The Network Provided Destination for Uplink Data feature is intended for
use when all data from a UE is to be directed to a network provided
destination address.

\- For uplink data communication, the network shall be able to direct
all uplink PS data traffic to a network provided destination address.

Note: This feature may be used, for example, when all data from an
electricity meter is sent to a server maintained by the network
operator.

25.4 PS only subscriptions
--------------------------

The system shall support subscriptions that only allow packet based
services and SMS.

26 Single Sign-On (SSO) Service
===============================

26.1 Requirements
-----------------

### 26.1.1 Requirements for the UE

An SSO-capable UE **shall support** 3GPP SSO Authentication, without
user intervention, based on Operator-controlled credentials.

An SSO-capable UE shall be able to initiate the SSO Service regardless
of the access network technologies supported by the UE.

An SSO-capable UE that supports 3GPP access and non-3GPP access shall
support transparency of the SSO Service from a user perspective during
transitions between 3GPP access and non-3GPP access, whether or not the
transition occurs during a data application session.

An SSO-capable UE may support a request for SSO Local User
Authentication from a Data Application Provider or an Identity Provider
to confirm the presence of the registered user of the data application.

### 26.1.2 Requirements for a 3GPP SSO Service

The 3GPP SSO Service shall provide secure, seamless and transparent
access to data applications for users of the SSO Service independent of
the access network technology.

The 3GPP SSO Service **shall be able to interwork with Identity
Management (IdM) specifications (e.g., OpenID \[51\]).**

The 3GPP SSO Service shall support 3GPP SSO Authentication based on
Operator-controlled credentials and policies.

The 3GPP SSO Service may support negotiation and use of an agreed
authentication method between the UE and the 3GPP SSO Identity Provider.
The negotiation of an authentication method may be repeated each time
the user accesses a DAP\'s service.

The 3GPP SSO Service may support mechanisms to ensure the presence of
the registered user of the data application to satisfy policies of the
Data Application Provider.

The 3GPP SSO Service shall be transparent from a user perspective when
transitions occur between 3GPP access and non-3GPP access, whether or
not the transition occurs during a data application session.

The 3GPP SSO Service shall be transparent from a user perspective when
the user accesses a data application using an identity created through a
3rd Party SSO Identity Provider. The user shall be able to configure
which 3rd party SSO identities are used with the 3GPP SSO Service.

26a User Identity
=================

26a.1 Introduction
------------------

Identifying distinguished user identities of the user (provided by some
external party or by the operator) in the operator network enables an
operator to provide an enhanced user experience and optimized
performance as well as to offer services to devices that are not part of
a 3GPP network. The user to be identified could be an individual human
user, using a UE with a certain subscription, or an application running
on or connecting via a UE, or a device ("thing") behind a gateway UE.

Network settings can be adapted and services offered to users according
to their needs, independent of the subscription that is used to
establish the connection. By acting as an identity provider the operator
can take additional information from the network into account to provide
a higher level of security for the authentication of a user.

Note: The basic concept and relations of user identity management is
described in TR 22.904 \[61\].

26a.2 Requirements
------------------

### 26a.2.1 User Identifiers and user authentication

The User Identifier shall be independent of existing identifiers
relating to subscription or device (e.g. IMSI, MSISDN, IMPI, IMPU, SUPI,
GPSI, IMEI) and of other User Identifiers.

The User Identifier may be provided by some entity within the operator's
network or by a 3rd party.

The 3GPP system shall support to interwork with a 3rd party network
entity for authentication of the User Identity.

The 3GPP system shall support to perform authentication of a User
Identity regardless of the user\'s access, the user\'s UE and its HPLMN
as well as the provider of the User Identifier.

### 26a.2.2 Access to services

The 3GPP system shall support to [ ]{.underline} allow a UE access to a
slice based on successful User Identity authentication.

The 3GPP system shall support to deny a UE access to a slice based on
unsuccessful User Identity authentication.

### 26a.2.3 (Void)

### 26a.2.4 Operator requirements

The operator shall be able to enable or disable the use of a User
Identifier in his network.

### 26a.2.5 Privacy requirements

The 3GPP system shall protect the privacy of the user by transferring to
a service only User Identity information that is necessary to provide
the service and for which the user has consented to when registering for
the service.

27 User plane congestion management
===================================

27.1 Introduction
-----------------

RAN user plane congestion, in the context of this clause, is considered
to be downlink congestion that affects the user plane, which may last
for a few seconds, a few minutes, or a few hours due to arrival of new
active users, increase of communication intensity of existing users, the
radio environment changing, the mobile user changing location, and other
reasons, thus causing the capacity of RAN resources to transfer user
data to be exceeded. A short-duration burst of user plane traffic should
not be identified as RAN congestion.

27.2 General
------------

a\) The network shall be able to detect RAN user plane congestion onset
and abatement. Mechanisms to cope with RAN user plane congestions should
be resilient to rapid changes in the level of congestion.

b\) The network shall be able to identify whether or not an active UE is
in a RAN user plane congested cell.

c\) The network operator shall be able to configure or provision and
enforce policy rules to best deal with RAN user plane congestion.

d\) The system should react in a timely manner to manage a RAN user
plane congestion situation, i.e. that the measures taken become
effective to promptly help resolve the RAN user plane congestion.

e\) The signalling overhead caused by RAN user plane congestion
management solutions in the system shall be minimized.

f\) The network shall be able to take into consideration the RAN user
plane congestion status and the subscriber\'s profile when coping with
traffic congestion.

27.3 Prioritizing traffic
-------------------------

a\) According to operator policy, during RAN user plane congestion the
operator shall be able to select the communications which require
preferential treatment and allocate sufficient resources for such
communications in order to provide these services with appropriate
service quality.

b\) According to operator policy, the network shall be able to select
specific users (e.g. heavy users, roaming users, etc.) and adjust the
QoS of existing connections/flows and apply relevant policies to new
connections/flows depending on the RAN user plane congestion status and
the subscriber\'s profile.

Note 1: Preferably, connections/flows need to be adjusted such that the
user experience is not negatively affected.

27.4 Reducing traffic
---------------------

a\) Based on RAN congestion status and according to operator policy, the
network shall be able to reduce the user plane traffic load (e.g. by
compressing images or by adaptation for streaming applications) taking
into account UE related information (e.g. UE capabilities,
subscription).

b\) The system shall be able to adjust the communication media
parameters of real-time communications so that they consume less
bandwidth.

27.5 Void
---------

28 RAN Sharing Enhancements
===========================

28.1 General
------------

RAN Sharing Enhancements allow multiple Participating Operators to share
the resources of a single RAN according to agreed allocation schemes.
The Shared RAN is provided by a Hosting RAN Operator which can be one of
the Participating Operators.

The Shared RAN can be GERAN, UTRAN, E-UTRAN or NG-RAN as described
below.

All the following requirements shall be subject to Hosting RAN Operator
configuration.

28.2 Specific E-UTRAN and NG-RAN Sharing requirements
-----------------------------------------------------

### 28.2.1 Allocation of Shared E-UTRAN and NG-RAN resources

When E-UTRAN and NG-RAN resources are shared they can be allocated
unequally to the Participating Operators, depending on the planned or
current needs of these operators and based on service agreements with
the Hosting E-UTRAN/NG-RAN Operator.

The following requirements apply:

The Hosting E-UTRAN/NG-RAN Operator shall be able to specify the
allocation of E-UTRAN/NG-RAN resources to each of the Participating
Operators by the following:

a\) static allocation, i.e. guaranteeing a minimum allocation and
limiting to a maximum allocation,

b\) static allocation for a specified period of time and/or specific
cells/sectors,

c\) first UE come first UE served allocation.

d\) the type and number of 5G slices

Resources include both user plane and signalling plane. The Hosting
E-UTRAN/NG-RAN Operator needs to be able to manage the sharing of the
signalling traffic independently from that of the user traffic because
signalling traffic and user traffic are not always directly related. For
example for MTC devices, the signalling traffic volume can be high and
the user traffic volume low whereas for downloading video, the
signalling traffic is low and the user traffic is high.

The following requirements apply:

The management and allocation of resources of signalling traffic over
the Shared E-UTRAN/NG-RAN shall be independent from the management and
allocation of resources of the user traffic over the Shared E-UTRAN.

A Shared E-UTRAN/NG-RAN shall be capable of differentiating traffic
associated with individual Participating Operators.

A Shared E-UTRAN/NG-RAN shall be able to conduct admission control based
on the allocated E-UTRAN/NG-RAN resources for each Participating
Operator.

A Hosting E-UTRAN/NG-RAN Operator shall be able to control resource
usage taking into account the allocated E-UTRAN/NG-RAN resources for
each Participating Operator. A means of monitoring the usage of
resources shall be provided.

All shared E-UTRAN/NG-RAN capabilities offered by the Hosting
E-UTRAN/NG-RAN Operator shall be individually available for use by each
Participating Operator where this is possible.

The 3GPP System shall support a Shared RAN (E-UTRAN or NG-RAN) to cover
a specific coverage area (e.g. from a complete network to a single cell,
both outdoor and indoor).

The 3GPP System shall support service continuity for UEs that are moving
between different Shared RANs or between a Shared RAN and a non-shared
RAN.

### 28.2.2 OA&M Access to the Shared E-UTRAN/NG-RAN

Each Participating Operator can have their own OA&M capabilities, which
are used for monitoring and for selected operations in a shared
E-UTRAN/NG-RAN. Information exchange involved in those operations need
to be controlled by the Hosting E-UTRAN/NG-RAN Operator as to prevent
disclosing them to other Participating Operators, be it for business,
operational, or technical reasons.

The following requirements apply:

Selected OA&M capabilities for the Shared E-UTRAN/NG-RAN, under the
control of the Hosting E- UTRAN Operator, shall be accessible by the
Participating Operator\'s OA&M functions

This would allow, for example, the Participating Operator to do the
following:

\- test of communication path between the Participating Operator\'s
network elements and the Shared E-UTRAN/NG-RAN,

\- obtain fault reports,

\- retrieve RAN resource usage information.

### 28.2.3 Generation and retrieval of usage and accounting information

To facilitate interoperator accounting between Hosting E-UTRAN/NG-RAN
Operator and Participating Operator the Hosting E-UTRAN/NG-RAN Operator
needs to record E-UTRAN/NG-RAN resource usage by UEs of the
Participating Operator.

The following requirements apply:

A Hosting E-UTRAN/NG-RAN Operator shall be able to collect events
supporting the accounting of network resource usage separately for each
Participating Operator. Collected events may be delivered to the
subscriber\'s Participating Operator. This includes:

\- start of service in the Shared E-UTRAN/NG-RAN for a UE of the
Participating Operator,

\- end of service in the Shared E-UTRAN/NG-RAN for a UE of the
Participating Operator.

### 28.2.4 MDT Collection

MDT data from a Participating Operator\'s customer UEs allow the Hosting
E-UTRAN/NG-RAN Operator to be provided with performance measurements on
his Shared E-UTRAN/NG-RAN. The Participating Operator is responsible for
obtaining and retaining any required user consent related to privacy.

The following requirements apply:

When authorized by the Participating Operators, the Hosting
E-UTRAN/NG-RAN Operator shall be able to collect MDT data of the
Participating Operator\'s UEs connected through its E-UTRAN/NG-RAN.

Note: This functionality should also allow for the case where the
Hosting E-UTRAN/NG-RAN Operator does not have an adjunct core network.

### 28.2.5 PWS support of Shared E-UTRAN/NG-RAN

A Participating Operator potentially has regulatory obligations to
initiate the broadcast of PWS messages regardless of E-UTRAN/NG-RAN
Sharing.

The following requirements apply:

The Shared E-UTRAN/NG-RAN shall be able to broadcast PWS messages
originated from the core networks of all Participating Operators.

Note: Rel-11 design requires a shared PWS core. However, some regulatory
obligations require a solution in which no common PWS core network
entity is involved.

### 28.2.6 Support for load balancing

Hosting E-UTRAN/NG-RAN Operators have the need to optimize
E-UTRAN/NG-RAN resource usage within the shared E-UTRAN/NG-RAN for a
particular coverage area. At the same time, the agreed shares of
E-UTRAN/NG-RAN resources based on a single cell and sector for each
Participating Operator need to be respected. Likewise, Participating
Operators have the need to optimize their E-UTRAN/NG-RAN resource usage
among shared and unshared E-UTRAN/NG-RAN for a particular coverage area.

The capability to perform load balancing on an individual Participating
Operator\'s traffic basis within a shared E-UTRAN/NG-RAN shall be
supported.

The capability to perform load balancing on the combined traffic of all
the Participating Operators within a shared E-UTRAN/NG-RAN shall be
supported.

The capability to perform load balancing between an individual
Participating Operator\'s traffic within a shared E-UTRAN/NG-RAN and
traffic in that Participating Operator\'s unshared E-UTRAN/NG-RAN where
the shared and unshared E-UTRAN/NG-RAN coverage overlaps shall be
supported.

Note: Load balancing capabilities are expected to take into account the
allocation of resources to each Participating Operator and the load
level for each Participating Operator to the extent possible, so that
the principal objective to maximize throughput is not impacted.

If load balancing in a Shared E-UTRAN/NG-RAN is supported and if a
Participating Operator's EPC indicates overload to the Shared
E-UTRAN/NG-RAN in order to mitigate the overload situation then overload
mitigation measures shall have minimal impact on the communication
between the Shared E-UTRAN/NG-RAN and other Participating Operators
EPCs.

### 28.2.7 Dynamic capacity negotiation

In situations where a need for additional, unplanned, E-UTRAN/NG-RAN
capacity by a Participating Operator arises (e.g. in the case of big
mass-events) the Shared E-UTRAN/NG-RAN can provide means to allocate
available spare capacity to the Participating Operator. Based on service
level agreement between the Hosting and Participating operator such
allocation can be automated without human intervention.

The following requirements apply:

The Participating Operator shall be able to query and request spare
capacity of the Shared E-UTRAN/NG-RAN, based on policies and without
human intervention.

The Shared E-UTRAN/NG-RAN shall be able to allocate spare capacity to
Participating Operator, based on policies and without human
intervention.

28.3 Specific GERAN & UTRAN Sharing Requirements
------------------------------------------------

### 28.3.1 Allocation of Shared GERAN or UTRAN Resources

When GERAN or UTRAN resources are shared they can be allocated unequally
to the Participating Operators, depending on the planned or current
needs of these operators and based on service agreements with the
Hosting RAN Operator.

The following requirements apply:

The Hosting RAN Operator shall be able to specify the allocation of
GERAN or UTRAN resources to each of the Participating Operators by the
following:

a\) static allocation, i.e. guaranteeing a minimum allocation and
limiting to a maximum allocation,

b\) static allocation for a specified period of time and/or specific
cells/sectors,

c\) first UE come first UE served allocation.

The management and allocation of resources of signalling traffic over
the Shared GERAN or UTRAN shall be independent from the management and
allocation of resources of the user traffic over the Shared GERAN or
UTRAN.

A Shared GERAN or UTRAN shall be capable of differentiating traffic
associated with individual Participating Operators and shall be able to
limit QoS available for traffic of the UEs of a Participating Operator
(e.g. "best effort" if not enough resources are available).

A Shared GERAN or UTRAN shall be able to conduct admission control based
on the allocated GERAN or UTRAN resources for each Participating
Operator with a margin of tolerance.

A Hosting RAN Operator shall be able to control resource usage taking
into account the allocated GERAN or UTRAN resources for each
Participating Operator. A means of monitoring the usage of resources
shall be provided.

All Shared GERAN or UTRAN capabilities offered by the Hosting RAN
Operator shall be individually available for use by each Participating
Operator where this is possible.

A Hosting RAN shall be able to provide an indication to each
Participating Operator of how much capacity they are allocated at any
one time. Signalling and User traffic shall be separately identified.

a number of Participating Operators shall be provided.

### 28.3.2 OA&M Access to the Shared GERAN or UTRAN

Each Participating Operator can have their own OA&M capabilities, which
are used for monitoring and for selected operations in a Shared GERAN or
UTRAN. Information exchange involved in those operations need to be
controlled by the Hosting RAN Operator so as to prevent disclosing them
to other Participating Operators, be it for business, operational, or
technical reasons.

The following requirements apply:

Selected OA&M capabilities for the Shared GERAN or UTRAN, under the
control of the Hosting RAN Operator, shall be accessible by the
Participating Operator\'s OA&M functions

This would allow, for example, the Participating Operator to do the
following:

\- test of communication path between the Participating Operator\'s
network elements and the Shared GERAN or UTRAN,

\- obtain fault reports,

\- retrieve GERAN or UTRAN resource usage information.

### 28.3.3 Generation and retrieval of usage and accounting information

To facilitate inter-operator accounting between the Hosting RAN Operator
and the Participating Operator, the Hosting RAN Operator needs to record
GERAN or UTRAN resource usage by UEs of the Participating Operator.

The following requirements apply:

A Hosting RAN Operator shall be able to collect events supporting the
accounting of network resource usage separately for each Participating
Operator. Collected events may be delivered to the subscriber\'s
Participating Operator. This includes:

\- start of service in the Shared GERAN or UTRAN for a UE of the
Participating Operator,

\- end of service in the Shared GERAN or UTRAN for a UE of the
Participating Operator.

### 28.3.4 MDT Collection

MDT data from a Participating Operator\'s customer UEs allow the Hosting
RAN Operator to be provided with performance measurements on his Shared
GERAN or UTRAN. The Participating Operator is responsible for obtaining
and retaining any required user consent related to privacy.

The following requirements apply:

When authorized by the Participating Operators, the Hosting RAN Operator
shall be able to collect MDT data of the Participating Operator\'s UEs
connected through its GERAN or UTRAN.

The Participating Operators shall be able to retrieve this data for
their own subscribers from the Hosting RAN Operator.

Note: This functionality should also allow for the case where the
Hosting RAN Operator does not have an adjunct core network.

### 28.3.5 PWS support of Shared GERAN or UTRAN

A Participating Operator potentially has regulatory obligations to
initiate the broadcast of PWS messages regardless of GERAN or UTRAN
Sharing.

The following requirements apply:

The Shared GERAN or UTRAN shall be able to broadcast PWS.

Note: The Hosting RAN Operator is responsible for the delivery of PWS
messages to the UEs.

### 28.3.6 Support for load balancing

Hosting RAN Operators need to optimise GERAN or UTRAN resource usage
within the Shared GERAN or UTRAN for a particular coverage area while
respecting the agreed resource shares for each Participating Operator.
Similarly, Participating Operators need to optimise their GERAN or UTRAN
resource usage between Shared and unshared GERAN or UTRAN for a
particular coverage area.

The Hosting RAN Operator shall have the capability to balance the
Signalling and User Traffic load individually for each Participating
Operator within a Shared GERAN or UTRAN.

The capability to perform load balancing on the combined traffic of all
the Participating Operators within a Shared GERAN or UTRAN shall be
provided. The agreed shares of GERAN or UTRAN resources shall be
maintained. Signalling and User traffic shall be managed independently.

The capability to perform load balancing between an individual
Participating Operator\'s traffic within a Shared GERAN or UTRAN and
traffic in that Participating Operator\'s unshared GERAN or UTRAN where
the Shared and unshared GERAN or UTRAN coverage overlaps shall be
supported.

The Hosting RAN Operator shall be able to balance the load across all
Participating Operators.

granted on-demand capacity requests.

The Hosting RAN Operator shall be able to cancel a granted request based
on a Participating Operator's request or based on agreed policy.

The Hosting RAN Operator shall be able to change the amount shared by
each Participating Operator based on traffic demand. A minimum capacity
(that can be set) of the Hosting RAN shall be reserved for each
Participating Operator that cannot be allocated to other Participating
Operators.

29 Service exposure with 3^rd^ party service providers
======================================================

29.1 General
------------

The intention of service exposure is that, under the assumption of a
service agreement between MNO and a 3rd party, the 3GPP Network allows a
3rd party service provider to benefit from network provided services and
capabilities that are exposed by the PLMN. For example the 3GPP Core
Network can exchange information with the 3rd party to optimize usage
and management of 3GPP resources. A standardized exposure of network
services/capabilities reduces the complexity of different 3^rd^ parties
to access different 3GPP network services and capabilities.

General requirements for service exposure with 3rd party service
providers:

\- The operator shall be able to provide to a 3rd party service provider
secure and chargeable access to the exposed services/capabilities i.e.
to authenticate, authorize and charge the 3rd party entities.

NOTE 1: This requirement can be implemented by the existing standardised
API frameworks e.g. the OMA API framework.

\- It shall be ensured that the 3GPP services/capabilities are not
disclosed to unauthorised parties and that user privacy (avoid e.g.
trackable and traceable identity information of the concerned UE) is
maintained subject to user agreement, operator policy, service agreement
between operator and 3rd party and regulation constraints.

\- The network service/capability exposure should be generic enough to
support different application needs. Exposed 3GPP services/capabilities
may use functionalities from different network entities and different
3GPP interfaces

29.2 Exposed Services and capabilities
--------------------------------------

The 3GPP Core Network shall be able provide a standardized interface to
enable exposure of the following services and capabilities to 3^rd^
party service providers:

Support of 3^rd^ party requested MTC Device triggering

\- The 3GPP Core Network shall support a 3rd party service provider
request to trigger a UE that is served by the 3rd party service
provider, the request shall include:

\- a trigger payload, to provide information to the application on the
UE to e.g. trigger application related actions,

\- a validity period.

NOTE 1: The 3GPP Network will attempt to deliver the trigger message to
the UE until the validity period expires.

\- The 3GPP Core Network shall support the 3^rd^ party service provider
to recall or replace a trigger message that it has previously submitted.

NOTE 2: The goal of device triggering is that the UE takes action based
on the content of the trigger payload. This response can involve
initiation of communication with an MTC Server of the 3^rd^ party
service provider. The UE can initiate communication immediately or later
within the validity period.

Support of 3rd party interaction for 3GPP resource management for
background data transfer:

\- The 3GPP Core Network shall support a 3rd party service provider
request for background data transfer for a set of UEs that are served by
the 3rd party service provider, indicating:

\- the desired time window for the data transfer,

\- the volume of the data expected to be transferred in a geographic
area TS 23.032 \[56\].

\- Additionally, the 3rd party application server shall be able to
indicate to the 3GPP System when the background data transfer (a)
exceeds the agreed maximum data volume or (b) continues beyond the
agreed time window or (c) happens outside the agreed areas -- e.g. due
to movement of individual UEs, whether this background data transfer:

> \- shall be stopped by the 3GPP Sytem or
>
> \- shall continue, possibly under a different charging regime.

\- The 3GPP Core Network shall be able to inform the 3rd party service
provider in one coordinated response, based on locally available
information (e.g. congestion level) over the geographic area, about:

\- one or more recommended time windows for the data transfer and

\- for each time window the maximum aggregated bitrate for the set of
UEs in the geographical area indicated by the 3rd party service
provider.

\- Additionally, the 3GPP Core Network shall be able to inform the 3rd
party service provider about the charging policy that will be applied to
the 3^rd^ party service provider if the data are transferred within the
recommended time window and if transmission rates stay below the limits
of the respective maximum aggregated bitrate.

\- The goal of providing the time window is to favour transfer of more
traffic during non-busy hours and reason for providing the maximum
aggregate bitrate is to spread out traffic during that time. The goal of
multiple time windows is to allow the 3rd party provider to choose one
appropriate time window based on its preference like the expected
charging regime and bitrate.

Support of 3^rd^ party interaction on information for predictable
communication patterns of a UE:

\- The 3GPP Core Network shall enable a 3rd party service provider to
provide information about predictable communication patterns of
individual UEs or groups of UEs that are served by this 3rd party
service provider.\
Such communication patterns may include:

\- Time and traffic volume related patterns (e.g. repeating
communication initiation intervals, desired 'keep alive' time of data
sessions, average/maximum volume per data transmission, etc.).

\- Location and Mobility related patterns (e.g. indication of stationary
UEs, predictable trajectories of UEs, etc.).

\- This information may be used by the 3GPP system to optimize resource
usage.

Support of 3^rd^ party requested session QoS and priority

\- The 3GPP Core Network shall enable a 3^rd^ party service provider to
request setting up data sessions with specified QoS (e.g. low latency or
jitter) and priority handling to a UE that is served by the 3rd party
service provider.

Support of 3^rd^ party requested broadcast

\- The 3GPP Core Network shall enable a 3rd party service provider to
request sending a broadcast message in a specified geographic area (as
specified in TS 22.368 \[52\]) expecting to reach a group of devices
that are served by the 3rd party service provider.

Informing the 3^rd^ party about potential network issues

\- The 3GPP Core Network shall be able to indicate to a 3rd party
service provider when data transmissions have a risk of incapability to
provide expected throughput and/or QoS in a specific area (e.g. due to
forecasted high traffic load in that area). Additionally, an estimate
may be given when the high traffic load is expected to be mitigated.

Informing the 3^rd^ party about UE status

\- The 3GPP Core Network shall be able to provide the following
information about a UE that is served by the 3^rd^ party service
provider:

\- Indication of the *of the roaming status (i.e. Roaming and No
Roaming) and the serving network, when the UE starts/stops roaming*,

\- Loss of connectivity of the UE,

\- Change or loss of the association between the ME and the USIM,

\- Communication failure events of the UE visible to the network (e.g.
for troubleshooting).

> \- Reporting when the UE moves in/out of a geographic area that is
> indicated by the 3rd party,
>
> \- Reporting when the UE changes Routing Area / Tracking Area /
> Location Area / Cell.
>
> \- *Reporting when the UE changes the status of 3GPP PS Data Off.*

Note: The area indicated by a 3^rd^ party service provider can be mapped
to the area used in the 3GPP network, i.e. a list of LAs/RAs/TAs/cells.
The 3rd party service provider can define a geographical area as shapes
(e.g. polygons, circles) or civic addresses (streets, districts...) as
referenced by OMA Presence API \[53\] e.g. defined by shape areas of
IETF RFC-5491 \[54\] or by civic addresses defined in IETF RFC-5139
\[55\].

\- The 3rd party service provider shall be able to request a one time
reporting or reporting at defined times (e.g. regular intervals, certain
pre-defined time points) on the number of UEs present in a certain area
and the location of each UE as for a Location Based Service.

\- Subject to user consent, operator policy and regulatory constraints,
the user privacy shall be maintained when passing location information
to a 3rd party service provider.

Informing the 3rd party about a UE's connection properties

\- The 3GPP Core Network shall be able to inform a 3^rd^ party about a
UE's connection properties.

Note: Connection properties of a UE describe the average data rate range
or non-absolute value (e.g. high, medium or low) that the UE is likely
to be able to obtain at the current location. The connection properties
can, for example, be generated from the UE's RAT type the UE is
currently attached to, the load conditions at its current location
and/or other parameters.

Support for non-IP small data transfer with a 3^rd^ party

\- The 3GPP Core Network shall support a 3^rd^ party for submiting a
small amount of non-IP data for delivery to a UE.

\- The 3GPP Core Network shall support a 3^rd^ party application server
for receiving a small amount of non-IP data delivered from a UE.

\- The 3GPP Core Network shall support a 3^rd^ party to configuring
non-IP data delivery for a particular UE (e.g. destination address,
maximum number of messages, duration for which configuration applies).

Note: The use of the Non-IP Data Delivery feature via Service Capability
Exposure Function assumes that the UE has indicated support for 'non-IP
data transfer' and in case the Service Capability Exposure Function is
used there will be no user plane EPS bearer established.

30 Flexible Mobile Service Steering
===================================

30.1 Introduction
-----------------

In order to realize efficient and flexible mobile service steering in
(S)Gi-LAN, the network operator uses information (e.g. user profile,
network operator's policies, RAT type, application characteristics) to
define traffic steering policies. These policies are used to steer the
subscriber's traffic to appropriate enablers (e.g. NAT, antimalware,
parental control, DDoS protection) in the (S)Gi-LAN.

The term (S)Gi-LAN used in the present document represents a system
which is out of 3GPP scope.

30.2 General Requirements
-------------------------

The following requirements apply:

\- The 3GPP Core Network shall be able to define and modify traffic
steering policies that are used to steer traffic in (S)Gi-LAN containing
operator or 3^rd^ party service functions e.g. to improve e.g. the
user's QoE, apply the bandwidth limitation and provide valued added
services.

\- Traffic steering policy shall be able to distinguish between upstream
and downstream traffic.

\- The 3GPP Core Network shall be able to define different traffic
steering policies for a user's traffic on a per session basis (e.g. for
applying parental control, anti-malware, DDoS protection, video
optimization).

\- The 3GPP Core Network defines traffic steering policies based on one
or more pieces of information such as:

\- network operator's policies

\- user subscription (e.g. user's priority, the status of optional
subscriber services from the subscription data, based on service
provider used, subscribed QoS)

\- user\'s current RAT

\- the network (RAN and CN) load status

\- application characteristics such as: application type (video, web
browsing, IM, etc), application protocol ( HTTP, P2P, etc), target
address name (URL) and application provider (My tube, etc)

\- time

\- UE location

\- information (e.g. APN) of the destination network (i.e. a PDN or an
internal IP network) of traffic flow

\- In case of roaming, the HPLMN shall be able to apply traffic steering
policies for home routed traffic.

Note: Traffic steering policies for local breakout is not specified.

31 Control of traffic from UE-based applications toward associated server
=========================================================================

31.1 Description
----------------

This feature is a set of service features that allows operators to
control traffic from UEs to an application on a third party server or
the third party server itself. When an application on a third party
server or the third party server itself becomes congested or fails the
traffic towards that server need to be controlled to avoid/mitigate
potential issues caused by resulting unproductive use of 3GPP network
resource. This will also make it possible to allow 3GPP network to help
third party servers to handle overload and recover from failures. (see
\[11\])

31.2 Requirements
-----------------

### 31.2.1 Control requirements

The 3GPP network shall be able to control (i.e. block and/or prioritize)
traffic from UEs to an application on a third party server or the third
party server itself without affecting traffic to other applications on
the third party server or to other third party servers.

For this purpose, the 3GPP network shall be able to identify the third
party server or the application on the third party server, and the
traffic towards it.

When congestion or failure of the application on the third party server
or the third party server abates the 3GPP network shall be able to apply
this feature in a phased manner to gradually restore traffic according
to operator policy.

The 3GPP network shall be able to control traffic through this feature
based on:

\(1\) the traffic load on the 3GPP network,\
(2) the MNO policy,\
(3) the MNO's service subscription profiles such as access class
information, and\
(4) third party service subscription profiles

without impacting the traffic to other applications on the third party
server or other third party servers.

### 31.2.2 Requirements on awareness of third party server issue

The 3GPP network shall be able to receive a status indication from the
third party server when an application on it is experiencing congestion
or failure, and when normal operation resumes. Such a status indication
may be sent periodically, and/or when the status of the application
changes.

The 3GPP network shall be able to detect and monitor a third party
server's operational status e.g. congestion levels, failure and
unavailability of the third party server.

32 3GPP enhancement for TV application support
==============================================

32.1 Feature description
------------------------

3GPP enhancement for TV service support is a feature whereby 3GPP
networks can provide unicast and broadcast transport, referred to as "TV
transport services", to support distribution of TV programs. TV
transport services can support the three types of TV services --
Free-to-air (FTA), Free-to-view (FTV), and Subscribed services. Each
type of TV service has different requirements in order to meet
regulatory obligations and public service and commercial broadcaster's
requirements regarding content distribution, hence many requirements
captured below are optional to implement depending on the type of TV
transport services an MNO chooses to offer.

32.2 Requirements
-----------------

### 32.2.1 General requirements

The 3GPP network shall be able to support on-demand network capacity
assignment for TV services.

The 3GPP system shall allow the MNO to implement a network supporting
downlink only broadcasting based on a set of EPS functionalities and
entities which are required to offer linear TV services.

The 3GPP network shall be able to support on-demand network broadcast
service area coverage management for TV transport services.

The 3GPP network shall support content delivery up to UHD resolution.

The 3GPP network shall allow the MNO to authenticate a subscriber before
providing TV transport services via unicast.

The 3GPP network shall allow the MNO to authenticate a subscriber before
providing TV transport services via eMBMS broadcast.

The 3GPP network shall enable an MNO to allow a UE to receive TV
transport services via eMBMS broadcast without authentication.

The 3GPP network shall be able to provide FTA TV services receivable by
UEs subscribed to the MNO and roaming UEs of other MNOs. A UE supporting
enhanced TV transport services and in limited service state shall be
able to receive eMBMS broadcast TV transport services.

The 3GPP network shall provide the ability for an MNO to meet regulatory
requirements for privacy and non-identification of a receiving user by
entities outside of the MNO.

NOTE: The MNO is responsible for maintaining the privacy of personal
usage data collected as a result of providing access to the TV services.

The 3GPP network shall provide mechanisms to restrict the reception of
some or all Subscribed TV services to groups of subscribers (e.g. based
on the recipients of the services are subscribers of the MNO, roaming
subscribers of other MNOs, or not subscribed to any MNO).

The quality of experience of the TV service shall be independent from
the size of the concurrent audience. While receiving TV services in
normal service state, subscribers of the MNO and roaming subscribers
shall be able to access other subscribed services such as voice, data or
SMS.

The 3GPP network shall support combinations of SD, FHD and UHD
resolution TV transport services.

The 3GPP network shall allow the MNO to provide a TV service in a
resource efficient manner over a large area up to the size of a country.

The 3GPP network shall enable the quality of experience of the TV
service to be ensured throughout the coverage area defined for the TV
service.

### 32.2.2 Requirement for transmission performance enhancement

The 3GPP system shall be able to support 20Mbps over one logical
broadcast channel.

The mechanisms in the 3GPP network shall be designed to support at least
10 high quality video channels of 12Mbps each simultaneously via
broadcast.

The 3GPP network shall support flexible change between broadcast and
unicast per traffic demand over the same carrier.

The 3GPP network shall be able to convert network unicast capacity to
network broadcast capacity and vice versa so that each can range from 0%
to 100% of the capacity.

The 3GPP network shall be able to support using one carrier for both
unicast and broadcast distribution of TV services.

If allowed by the operator and a spare carrier is available, the 3GPP
network shall be able to make use of spare carriers or free up carriers
if not required anymore.

### 32.2.3 Requirement for network flexibility

The 3GPP network shall be able to support network broadcast capacity
assignment according to operator policies to consider the following
criteria:

-   OTT provider request (including TV service information(e.g., codec
    information, media type information, etc))

-   available network unicast/broadcast capacity of 3GPP network

Within the radio resources dedicated to TV services in a geographic area
the 3GPP network shall allow the MNO to specify the allocation of radio
resource by the following:

-   static allocation, i.e., pre-defined maximum percentage to be used
    for unicast and broadcast

-   dynamic allocation, i.e., the pre-defined maximum percentage for
    both unicast and broadcast to be changed at a time-resolution of
    \[one\] minute over a period of \[24\] hours

The 3GPP network shall be able to support network broadcast geographic
area coverage management considering following criteria:

-   OTT provider request (including the potential coverage information
    of TV service information)

-   available network unicast/broadcast capacity of 3GPP network

-   number of users under broadcast network coverage

-   The location information of UE

The 3GPP network shall be able to deliver media content via unicast and
broadcast in an efficient manner. The 3GPP system shall be capable of
ensuring the timing sequence of different media content received by
different UEs at the same location, even via different transport path,
aligning with the timing sequence of TV service of the OTT provider in
order to maintain synchronism.

A UE shall be able to receive eMBMS from one cell site while receiving
other services from the same cell site or another possibly cell site.

The 3GPP network shall allow a MNO to service all UEs in an area with
eMBMS independent of which MNO network(s) they have subscription to.

### 32.2.4 Requirement for TV application support

The eMBMS service layer should support audio and video formats typically
supported by TV Content Providers for SD and HD TV transport services
and UHD TV transport services.

The eMBMS service layer should support codecs typically supported by TV
Content Providers for HD TV services and UHD TV services. The eMBMS
service layer should support accessibility functions typically supported
by TV Content Providers (e.g. subtitling, closed captioning, audio
descriptions, anonymous reception, reporting to support ratings,
reporting enforcement, etc.).

The eMBMS service layer should support regulatory mandates typically
supported by TV Content Providers (blackouts, emergency alerts, etc.).

The eMBMS service layer should support interactivity functions typically
supported by TV Content Providers (interactive services, second screen,
personalization, etc.).

The eMBMS service layer should support ad insertion use cases typically
supported by TV Content Providers (targeted ad insertion, ad
replacement, etc.),

The eMBMS service layer should support encryption, security and
conditional access functions typically supported by TV Content
Providers.

The eMBMS service layer should support efficient concurrent delivery of
multiple application components (TV service application signalling,
statistical multiplexing, etc.).

The eMBMS service layer should support random access and channel change
times comparable to existing HD TV services.

The eMBMS service layer should support TV service content delivery over
broadcast only, unicast only and combinations of the two.

The eMBMS service layer should support delivery of real-time and
non-real-time content.

The eMBMS service layer should enable extensibility and
forward-compatibility to new requirements, formats, codecs and other
functions to the extent possible.

An eMBMS transport layer should be able to transport TV streams
formatted not compliant to 3GPP standards.

A UE should be able to access an eMBMS transport session with the
support of only transport metadata.

An eMBMS system should be able to be initiated by a UE with sufficient
metadata provided by a mechanism other than User Service Description for
non 3GPP transport services.

### 32.2.5 Requirement for RAN sharing

A participating eMBMS-enabled RAN shall be capable of distributing the
content including both free-to-air content and subscribed content in
conjunction with other participating eMBMS-enabled RANs.

The hosting eMBMS-enabled RAN network provider shall be able to manage
the shared eMBMS network to each of the participating MNOs.

Each RAN provider shall report events supporting the accounting of
network resource usage separately for each Participating MNO. This
includes:

-   Start of service in the shared eMBMS network for a UE of the
    Participating MNO

-   End of service in the shared eMBMS network for a UE of the
    Participating MNO

### 32.2.6 Requirement for wide area support

The eMBMS network shall be able to support designated coverage area, for
example national, regional and local coverage areas.

### 32.2.7 Requirement for capability exposure

The 3GPP system shall be able to support an MNO offering on-demand
broadcast availability to TV services.

Subject to MNO and 3rd OTT party agreement, to enable the MNO to
evaluate the impact on distribution of data transfer in the network, the
3rd OTT party shall be able to indicate to the MNO the desired media
format information: the volume of the data traffic expected to be
broadcast in this geographic area, indication whether the streaming
content can be accessed when the mobile users moves out/in of broadcast
coverage area, indication whether the streaming content can be cached in
the MNO network, association information among users i.e. user
information, expected media content information, device information and
group information of TV service and the timing relationship information
of different media content.

The 3GPP network shall enable an MNO to inform a 3rd party of the result
(e.g., selected media format information, mode of content delivery
(broadcast only, broadcast/unicast fall-back support, consumption-based
switching between unicast/broadcast), QoE of content delivery, cached
content indication) of delivering a TV service to a user.

### 32.2.8 Fixed reception for TV services

The 3GPP network shall allow a UE to receive a broadcast TV content
using existing TV antenna equipment.

NOTE 1: "existing TV antenna equipment" means rooftop or indoor antennas
directly connected to a TV or set-top box typically used to receive DTT
signals

The 3GPP network shall allow a UE to receive unicast TV content using
existing TV antenna equipment, at least for the downlink

NOTE 2: This might imply the uplink to take another path e.g. via a
different antenna if existing TV antenna equipment is not suitable for
transmission.

33 Usage over unlicensed access
===============================

33.1 Description
----------------

It is important to document usage over unlicensed access such that an
operator has the facility to determine which type of access the traffic
was transported over.

For example, LTE-WiFi Aggregation (LWA) and License Assisted Access
(LAA) are two features whereby a UE is connected to two access
technologies at the same time, i.e., a primary access and a secondary
access, where the secondary access technology operates in unlicensed
spectrum.

33.2 Requirements
-----------------

The 3GPP network shall be able to identify traffic which was transported
over unlicensed access.

34 Void
=======

34.1 Void
---------

34.2 Void
---------

35 Restricted local operator services
=====================================

35.1 Description
----------------

Access to restricted local operator services by unauthenticated UEs is
based on FCC regulations in the U.S. related to manual roaming as noted
in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Title 47 Chapter 1 Subchapter B
Part 20 Section 20.3 and the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Title 47
Chapter 1 Subchapter B Part 20 Section 20.12 (Resale and Roaming)
Subparagraph c \[60\].

The restricted local operator services offered by an operator are out of
scope of 3GPP. Allowing access to restricted local operator services is
completely under the local operator's control. The local operator can
restrict unauthenticated UEs to be able to access restricted local
operator services exclusively.

Authenticated UEs in limited service state may also be able to use
restricted local operator services.

NOTE: Services provided through RLOS may also be available to
authenticated UEs not in limited service state by other methods.

35.2 Requirements
-----------------

Based on operator policy and national regulations, the 3GPP system shall
support a mechanism to indicate to UEs that restricted local operator
services are available.

A UE shall be able to explicitly request access to a network offering
restricted local operator services in order to access restricted local
operator services.

A UE explicitly requesting access to a network offering restricted local
operator services in order to receive restricted local operator services
shall not be put into limited service state.

Based on operator policy and national regulations, the 3GPP system shall
support mechanisms to allow access to restricted local operator services
by unauthenticated UEs.

The network shall be able to isolate restricted local operator services
and usage from the rest of the network (i.e., similar to security for
unauthenticated CS or IMS emergency calls).

When a UE recognizes an origination attempt to a restricted local
operator service and has not received an indication from the serving
system that restricted local operator services are available, the UE
shall block the origination attempt.

The UE shall include the restricted local operator service call type
indicator when an origination attempt is made for a restricted local
operator service.

######## Annex A (normative): Description of optional user equipment features

A.1 Display of called number
----------------------------

This feature enables the caller to check before call setup whether the
selected number is correct.

A.2 Indication of call progress signals
---------------------------------------

Indications shall be given such as tones, recorded messages or visual
display based on signalling information returned from the PLMN. On data
calls, this information may be signalled to the DTE.

Call progress indicators are described in 3GPP TS 22.001 \[4\].

A.3 Country/PLMN indication
---------------------------

The country/PLMN indicator shows in which PLMN the UE is currently
registered. This indicator is necessary so that the user knows when
\"roaming\" is taking place and that the choice of PLMN is correct. Both
the country and PLMN will be indicated. When more than one visited PLMN
is available in a given area such information will be indicated.

The PLMN name is either:

\- Stored in the ME and associated with the MCC+MNC combination received
on the broadcast channel;

\- NITZ (see 22.042 \[17\]) (in which case it overrides the name stored
in the ME);

\- stored in the USIM in text and /or graphic format and associated with
the MCC+MNC combination, and optionally the LAI, received on the
broadcast channel (in which case it overrides the name stored in the UE
and -- if present -- the NITZ name).

It shall be possible to store on the USIM at least 10 PLMN
Identifications (MCC+MNC combination and optionally the LAI) for which
the same PLMN name shall be displayed.

The PLMN name stored in the USIM has the highest priority, followed by
the PLMN name provided by NITZ. The PLMN name stored in the ME has the
lowest priority.

If the PLMN name stored in the USIM is not available in text format and
the UE is unable to display the graphic format, the PLMN name provided
by NITZ has the highest priority, the PLMN name stored in the ME has the
next priority.

For a PLMN name provided by NITZ, operators using non-Latin characters
of the local language (such as Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese,
Arabic, Hindi, etc.) may include the network name in Latin characters in
addition to characters of the local language.

For a PLMN name provided by NITZ, the roaming UE should skip displaying
non-Latin character(s) if the language of those character(s) does not
match the language of the MMI for the UE. If this would lead to no
remaining Latin character in the PLMN name, the UE should skip
displaying the PLMN name provided by NITZ; the PLMN name stored in the
ME has the next priority instead.

A.4 Service Provider Name indication
------------------------------------

The service provider name is stored in the USIM in text and/or
optionally graphic format. It shall be possible to associate at least 10
PLMN Identifications (MCC+MNC combination) with the same SP Name.

When registered on the HPLMN, or one of the PLMN Identifications used
for Service Provider Name display:

\(i\) The SP Name shall be displayed;

\(ii\) Display of the PLMN Name is an operator\'s option by setting the
appropriate fields in the USIM (i.e. the Service Provider name shall be
displayed either in parallel to the PLMN Name or instead of the PLMN
Name).

When registered on neither the HPLMN, nor one of the PLMN
Identifications used for Service Provider Name display:

\(i\) The PLMN name shall be displayed;

\(ii\) Display of the SP Name is an operator\'s option by setting the
appropriate fields in the USIM.

If the UE is unable to display the full name of the Service Provider the
name is cut from the tail end. The storage of Service Provider name and
options, and choice of options, shall be under control of the network
operator.

A.4a Core Network Operator Name indication
------------------------------------------

It shall be possible for the UE to display the name of the core network
operator the user has selected.

A.5 Keypad
----------

A physical means of entering numbers, generally, though not necessarily,
in accordance with the layout shown in figure A.1.

See also 3GPP TS 22.030 \[6\] (Man-Machine Interface).

Additional keys may provide the means to control the UE (e.g. to
initiate and terminate calls).

Figure A.1

A.6 Short message indication and acknowledgement
------------------------------------------------

This feature allows the delivery of short messages to a UE from a
service centre. Such messages are submitted to the service centre by a
telecommunications network user who can also request information of the
status of the message by further interrogation of the service centre.
The service centre then transmits the message to an active UE user.

The UE must therefore provide an indication to the user that a message
has been received from the service centre and must also send an
acknowledgement signal to the PLMN to show that this indication has been
activated. The PLMN then returns this acknowledgement to the service
centre.

The short message service teleservice is described in specification 3GPP
TS 22.003 \[14\].

A.7 Short message overflow indication
-------------------------------------

An indication shall be given to the user of the short message service
when an incoming message cannot be received due to insufficient
available memory.

A.8 International access function
---------------------------------

Provision is made for a direct, standard method of gaining international
access. For this purpose the UE may have a key whose primary or
secondary function is marked \"+\". This is signalled over the air
interface and would have the effect of generating the international
access code in the network. It may be used directly when setting up a
call, or entered into the memory for abbreviated dialling.

This feature is of benefit since the international access code varies
between CEPT countries, which might cause confusion to a user, and
prevent the effective use of abbreviated dialling when roaming
internationally. Users may still place international calls
conventionally, using the appropriate international access code.

A.9 Service Indicator (SI)
--------------------------

An indication is given to the user that there is adequate signal
strength (as far as can be judged from the received signal) to allow a
call to be made. Additionally the network should be capable of
providing, and the UE may display, an indication of the serving cells\'
capabilities e.g. GPRS, HSDPA, HSUPA.

If indicated by the registered network, the UE in idle mode may display
an indication of one of the radio access technologies provided to the UE
in the network on which the UE is registered with the following priority
order: E-UTRAN, UTRAN, GERAN.

Displaying the serving cell\'s capabilities and the access technology
are mutually exclusive.

A.10 Dual Tone Multi Frequency (DTMF)
-------------------------------------

The UE shall be capable of initiating DTMF in accordance with
specifications 3GPP TS 22.003 \[14\]. Optionally, the UE may provide a
suppress function which allows the user to switch off the DTMF function.

A.11 On/Off switch
------------------

The UE may be provided with a means of switching its power supply on and
off. Switch-off shall be \"soft\", so that on activation, the UE
completes the following housekeeping functions: termination of a current
call, detach (where applicable) and storing required data in the
SIM/USIM before actually switching off. As far as possible, this
procedure should also apply on power failure (e.g. remote switch-off or
low battery).

A.12 Sub-Address
----------------

This feature allows the mobile to append and/or receive a sub-address to
a Directory Number, for use in call set-up, and in those supplementary
services that use a Directory Number.

A.13 Short Message Service Cell Broadcast
-----------------------------------------

The Short Message Service Cell Broadcast enables the mobile equipment to
receive short messages from a message handling system.

The short message service cell broadcast teleservice is described in
specification 3GPP TS 22.003 \[14\]

A.14 Short Message Service Cell Broadcast DRX
---------------------------------------------

This feature enables a mobile equipment to save on battery utilization,
by allowing the mobile equipment to not listen during the broadcast of
messages the subscriber is not interested in.

A.15 Support of the extended Short message cell broadcast channel
-----------------------------------------------------------------

This feature allows a mobile equipment by supporting of the extended
Short message cell broadcast channel to enhance the capacity of the
service. The support of the extended channel has low priority, i.e. the
UE can interrupt the reading of this channel if idle mode procedures
have to be executed.

A.16 Network Identity and Timezone
----------------------------------

The feature provides the means for serving PLMNs to transfer current
identity, universal time and the local timezone to mobile equipments,
and for the mobile equipments to store and use this information. This
enhances roaming by permitting accurate indication of PLMN identities
that are either newer than the ME or have changed their name since the
ME was sold. Additionally time and timezone information can be utilized
by MEs as desired.

The network name time and timezone information will normally be
transferred from the network to the ME:

1\) Upon registering on the network.

2\) When the UE geographically relocates to a different Local Time Zone.

3\) When the network changes its Local Time Zone, e.g. between summer
and winter time.

4\) When the network changes its identity.

5\) At any time during a signalling connection with mobile equipment.

Further details of this feature are described in 3GPP TS 22.042 \[15\].

A.17 Network\'s indication of alerting in the UE
------------------------------------------------

This feature provides the means for serving PLMNs to transfer to a UE an
indication that may be used by the UE to alert the user in a specific
manner in the following cases:

\- mobile terminating call

\- network initiated USSD

\- network initiated Mobile Originated (MO) connection, if the ME
supports the \"network initiated MO connection \" feature.

Eight different indications are defined, whether the mobile terminating
traffic is a call or USSD or related to the network initiated MO
connection procedure. These indications are sent by the network and
received by the UE:

\- Three of these indications are used as levels, reflecting some kind
of urgency: level 0 indicates that the UE shall not alert the user for
USSD and remain silent in the case of call, level 2 shall be considered
by the UE as more important than level 1 for the purpose of alerting the
user.

\- The five other indications are used as categories, identifying
different types of terminating traffic. The UE shall inform the user in
a specific manner for each of these five categories. Nevertheless, the
possible forms of the alert (different ringing tones, displayed text,
graphical symbols\...) is still up to the mobile manufacturer (some
forms of alerts can be simultaneously used, e.g. ringing tones and text
on the display).

The management of the feature by the UE requires for the handling of
categories that :

\- the SIM/USIM stores for each category an informative text (maximum 25
characters per category) describing the type of terminating traffic
associated with the category. This information could be used by the UE
when alerting the user (display on the screen). It is necessary for the
network operator to be able to change the meaning of each category.

\- The user has the ability to set up his/her own association between
the type of terminating traffic (identified by each category) and the
different types of alert provided by the UE. To help the user in this
choice, the UE uses the informative text associated with each category
(as stored in the SIM/USIM). The UE should keep this association when
switched off.

Default settings should also be defined in the ME for the following
cases :

\- when the UE receives a call, USSD or a request for a network
initiated MO connection with no alerting indication,

\- when the UE receives a call, USSD or a request for a network
initiated MO connection with a category of alerting not defined in the
SIM/USIM.

These default settings should be separated per type of mobile terminated
traffic received (call, USSD or request for a network initiated MO
connection).

A UE supporting the feature shall act according to the following points
in case of mobile terminating traffic :

\- when a mobile terminating traffic is received without any indication
(level or category), the ME shall act as if it was not supporting the
feature, i.e. use a default alert (e.g. associated with this type of
mobile terminating traffic).

\- if a level is indicated, the UE shall use an alert enabling the user
to differentiate between the three levels.

\- if a category is indicated, then :

\- if the SIM/USIM used in the UE does not store any information on that
feature, the UE shall ignore the category received with any mobile
terminating traffic and act as if it was not supporting the feature,
i.e. use a default alert (e.g. associated with this type of mobile
terminating traffic).

\- if the category is not defined in the SIM/USIM, the UE shall act as
if it was not supporting the feature, i.e. use a default alert (e.g.
associated with this type of mobile terminating traffic).

\- if the category is defined in the SIM/USIM, the UE shall use the
alert associated with this category. In addition, it would be very
useful for the user to be notified of the informative text associated
with this category (e.g. on the display).

Some interactions between this feature and other services related to
alerting are described below :

\- the call waiting service has priority on this feature, i.e. the call
waiting tone will be played and not the alert derived by this feature.
If possible, two different indications should be given to the user (e.g.
the call waiting tone and a text on the display indicating call waiting,
and in addition a text relative to the type of the new call received).

\- the presentation of the calling line identity takes priority on this
feature, if it is not possible to display this information and another
information related to this feature.

\- In case of interaction between this feature and UE specific features
to alert the user (e.g. whole silent mode), the user should still be
able to differentiate between the different levels or different types of
terminating traffic, even if the alert itself may be changed.

A.18 Network initiated Mobile Originated (MO) connection
--------------------------------------------------------

The \"Network Initiated Mobile Originated connection\" feature allows
the network to ask the mobile equipment to establish a mobile originated
connection. The serving PLMN provides the mobile equipment with the
necessary information which is used by the mobile equipment to establish
the connection.

Currently only the network initiated mobile originated call feature is
specified. It is mandatory for a UE supporting CCBS and is used in the
case of a CCBS recall.

A.19 Abbreviated dialling
-------------------------

The directory number or part of it is stored in the mobile equipment
together with the abbreviated address. After retrieval the directory
number may appear on the display.

Abbreviated dialling numbers stored in the UE or USIM may contain wild
characters.

If wild characters are used to indicate missing digits, each wild
character shall be replaced for network access or supplementary service
operation, by a single digit entered at the keypad. The completed
directory number is transmitted on the radio path.

A.20 Barring of Dialled Numbers
-------------------------------

This feature provides a mechanism so that by the use of an electronic
lock it is possible to place a bar on calling any numbers belonging to a
pre-programmed list of numbers in the SIM/USIM.

Barred Dialling Numbers stored in the /USIM may contain wild characters.

Under control of PIN2, \"Barred Dialling Mode\" may be enabled or
disabled. The selected mode is stored in the SIM/USIM.

Under PIN2 control, it shall be possible to add, modify or delete a
particular \"Barred Dialling Number\" (BDN) and to allocate or modify
its associated comparison method(s). This BDN may have the function of
an abbreviated dialling number / supplementary service control
(ADN/SSC), overflow and/or sub-address.

When BDN is inactive, no special controls are specified, and the barred
dialling numbers may be read (though not modified or deleted, except
under PIN2 control) as if they were normal abbreviated dialling numbers.
Access to keyboard and normal abbreviated dialling numbers (including
sub-address) is also permitted.

When Barring of Dialled Numbers is active:

\- Considering a number dialled by the user, if it exists a BDN for
which there is a successful comparison (see below) between that BDN and
the dialled number, then the ME shall prevent the call attempt to that
number. If there is no BDN to fulfil those conditions, the call attempt
is allowed by the ME.

With each BDN is associated one (or a combination of) comparison
method(s) used between that BDN and the number dialled by the user. At
least three different comparison methods are possible:

\- The comparison is made from the first digit of that BDN, from the
first digit of the dialled number and for a number of digits
corresponding to the length of the BDN.

\- The comparison is made from the first digit of that BDN, from any
digit of the dialled number and for a number of digits corresponding to
the length of the BDN.

\- The comparison is made backwards from the last digit of that BDN,
from the last digit of the dialled number and for a number of digits
corresponding to the length of the BDN.

\- If a BDN stored in the SIM/USIM contains one or more wild characters
in any position, each wild character shall be replaced by any single
digit when the comparison between that BDN and the dialled number is
performed.

\- If a BDN contains a sub-address, and the same number without any
sub-address or with that sub‑address is dialled, the ME shall prevent
the call attempt to that number.

\- Numbers specified as \"barred\" may only be modified under PIN2
control.

\- If the ME does not support barring of dialled numbers, the UE with a
BDN enabled USIM shall not allow the making of calls and the UE with BDN
enabled SIM shall not allow the making or receiving of calls. However,
this feature does not affect the ability to make emergency calls.

If \"Fixed Number Dialling\" and \"Barring of Dialled Numbers\" are
simultaneously active, the dialled number shall be checked against the
two features before the ME allows the call attempt. In that case, a
dialled number will only be allowed by the ME if it is in the FDN list
and if the comparison between that number and any number from the BDN
list is not successful.

The UE may support other selective barrings, e.g. applying to individual
services (e.g. telephony, data transmission) or individual call types
(e.g. long distance, international calls).

A.21 DTMF control digits separator
----------------------------------

Provision has been made to enter DTMF digits with a telephone number,
and upon the called party answering the UE shall send the DTMF digits
automatically to the network after a delay of 3 seconds (± 20 %). The
digits shall be sent according to the procedures and timing specified in
3GPP TS 24.008 \[13\].

The first occurrence of the \"DTMF Control Digits Separator\" shall be
used by the ME to distinguish between the addressing digits (i.e. the
phone number) and the DTMF digits. Upon subsequent occurrences of the
separator, the UE shall pause again for 3 seconds (± 20 %) before
sending any further DTMF digits.

To enable the separator to be stored in the address field of an
Abbreviated Dialling Number record in the SIM/USIM, the separator shall
be coded as defined in 3GPP TS 31.102 \[19\]. The telephone number shall
always precede the DTMF digits when stored in the SIM/USIM.

The way in which the separator is entered and display in the UE, is left
to the individual manufacturer\'s MMI.

MEs which do not support this feature and encounter this separator in an
ADN record of the SIM/USIM will treat the character as \"corrupt data\"
and act accordingly.

A.22 Selection of directory number in messages
----------------------------------------------

The Short Message Service (SMS), Cell Broadcast Service (CBS),
Multimedia Message Service (MMS), Network Initiated USSD or Network
Response to Mobile Originated USSD message strings may be used to convey
a Directory Number, which the user may wish to call.

A.23 Last Numbers Dialled (LND)
-------------------------------

The Last \"N\" Numbers dialled may be stored in the SIM/USIM and/or the
ME. \"N\" may take the value up to 10 in the SIM/USIM. It may be any
value in the ME. The method of presentation of these to the user for
setting up a call is the responsibility of the UE but if these numbers
are stored in both the SIM/USIM and the UE, those from the SIM/USIM
shall take precedence.

A.24 Service Dialling Numbers
-----------------------------

The Service Dialling Numbers feature allows for the storage of numbers
related to services offered by the network operator/service provider in
the SIM/USIM (e.g. customer care). The user can use these telephone
numbers to make outgoing calls, but the access for updating of the
numbers shall be under the control of the operator.

Note: No MMI is envisaged to be specified for these numbers and it is
left to mobile manufacturer implementations.

A specific example of Service Dialling Numbers is the storage of mailbox
dialling numbers on the SIM/USIM for access to mailboxes associated with
Voicemail, Fax, Electronic Mail and Other messages.

A.25 Fixed number dialling
--------------------------

This feature provides a mechanism so that by the use of an electronic
lock it is possible to place a bar on calling any numbers other than
those pre-programmed in the SIM/USIM.

Under control of PIN 2, \"Fixed Dialling Mode\" may be enabled or
disabled. The mode selected is stored in the SIM/USIM.

Fixed Dialling Numbers (FDNs) are stored in the SIM/USIM in the Fixed
Dialling Number field. FDN entries are composed of a destination
address/Supplementary Service Control. Destination addresses may have
the format relevant to the bearer services/teleservices defined in
\[21\] and \[14\]. FDN entries may take the function of an Abbreviated
Dialling Number/Supplementary Service Control (ADN/SSC), Overflow and/or
sub-address. Fixed Dialling Numbers stored in the SIM/USIM may contain
wild card characters.

The Fixed Dialling feature is optional, however when Fixed Dialling Mode
is enabled, an ME supporting the feature shall;

\- Prevent the establishment of bearer services/teleservices to
destination addresses which are not in FDN entries on a per bearer
service/teleservice basis. The list of bearer services/teleservices
excluded from the FDN check shall be stored in the SIM/USIM. Those
bearer services/teleservices are characterised by their service code as
described in \[23\]. For instance if the SMS teleservices is indicated
in this list, SMS can be sent to any destination. By default, the ME
shall prevent the establishment of any bearer service/teleservice to
destination addresses which are not in FDN entries.

\- Only allow modification, addition or deletion of Fixed Number
Dialling entries under control of PIN2.

\- Allow the establishment of bearer services/teleservice to destination
addresses stored in FDN entries. For SMS, the Service Center address and
the end-destination address shall be checked.

\- Support the reading and substitution of wildcards in any position of
an FDN entry, via the ME MMI.

\- Allow the user to replace each wildcard of an FDN entry by a single
digit, on a per call basis without using PIN2. The digit replacing the
wildcard may be used for network access or supplementary service
operation.

\- Only allow Supplementary Service (SS) Control (in Dedicated or Idle
mode) if the SS control string is stored as an FDN entry.

\- Allow the extension of an FDN entry by adding digits to the Fixed
Dialling number on a per call basis.

\- Allow the emergency numbers (see Section 8.4) to be called, even if
it is not an FDN entry.

\- Allow normal access to ADN fields (i.e. allow ADN entries to be
modified, added or deleted) and the keyboard.

\- Allow use of ADNs subject to the FDN filter.

When FDN is disabled, an ME supporting FDN shall;

\- Allow FDN entries to be read as though they were normal ADN entries.

\- Only allow modification, addition or deletion of Fixed Number
Dialling entries under control of PIN2.

\- Allow normal access to ADN fields and the keyboard.

If the ME does not support FDN, the UE shall not allow the making of
calls when Fixed Dialling is enabled in the USIM, and the UE shall not
allow the making or receiving of calls when Fixed Dialling is enabled in
the SIM. However, emergency calls (112 and other user defined emergency
numbers) shall still be possible.

Note: Wildcards are stored on the SIM/USIM. The wildcard coding is given
in 3GPP TS 31.102 \[19\].

A.26 Message Waiting Indication
-------------------------------

A short message may be used to provide an indication to the user about
the status and number of types of messages waiting on systems connected
to the PLMN. The ME shall present this indication as an icon on the
screen, or other MMI indication, and store the indication status on the
SIM/USIM to allow the status to be retained through power off/on,
SIM/USIM movement between UEs etc..

The ME shall be able to accept and acknowledge these message waiting
status short messages irrespective of the memory available in the
SIM/USIM.

A.27 Transfer of eCall Minimum Set of Data (MSD)
------------------------------------------------

A.27.1 General Requirements
---------------------------

With the exception of the following specific requirements, considered
necessary for the satisfactory operation of the eCall service, all
existing emergency call requirements shall apply.

An eCall shall consist of an emergency call supplemented by a minimum
set of emergency related data (MSD). The MSD e.g. vehicle identity,
location information and other parameters, is defined by CEN \[46\].

\- An eCall may be initiated automatically, for example due to a vehicle
collision, or manually by the vehicle occupants;

> \- An IVS, or other UE designed to support eCall functionality, shall
> include in the emergency call set-up an indication that the present
> call is either a Manually Initiated eCall (MIeC) or an Automatically
> Initiated eCall (AIeC).

\- The Minimum Set of Data (MSD) sent by the In vehicle System (IVS) to
the network shall not exceed 140 bytes;

\- Should the MSD component not be included in an eCall, or is corrupted
or lost for any reason, then this shall not affect the associated
emergency call speech functionality.

\- To reduce the time taken to establish an eCall an IVS whilst in eCall
only mode, may receive network availability information whilst not
registered on a PLMN.

\- PLMNs should make use of eCall indicators, received in the emergency
call set-up, to differentiate eCalls from other emergency calls.

\- The MIeC and AIeC should be used by the serving network to filter and
route eCalls to dedicated, eCall equipped, PSAPs.

\- The PSAP shall be given an indication that the incoming call is an
eCall.

\- When an emergency call, other than an eCall, is routed to a PSAP that
supports the eCall service, the eCall equipment shall not cause audible
interference to the emergency voice call.

Throughout the duration of the emergency call and following receipt of
the MSD by the PSAP

\- It shall be possible for the PSAP to send a confirmation to the IVS
that the MSD has been acted upon.

\- It shall be possible for the PSAP to request the IVS to re-send its
most recent MSD.

\- It shall be possible for the PSAP to instruct the IVS to terminate
the eCall.

A.27.2 Requirements for the transfer of eCall MSD in a TS12 call
----------------------------------------------------------------

The MSD should typically be made available to the PSAP within 4 seconds
measured from the time when end to end connection with the PSAP is
established;

A call progress indication shall be provided to the user whilst the MSD
transmission is in progress.

Where the eCall indicators are not supported by the serving network, the
time needed for the PSAP eCall modem to differentiate between eCalls and
other TS12 calls, before routing the call to an operator, shall not
exceed 2 seconds from when the IVS receives notification that the PSAP
has answered the call.

When an eCall is routed to a PSAP, that does not support the eCall
service, the In Vehicle System (IVS) shall not emit any audible tones
for longer than 2 seconds from the time that the call is first answered.

A.27.3 Requirements for the transfer of eCall data in an IMS emergency call
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The MSD should typically be available to the PSAP when the end to end
connection with the PSAP has been established.

Note: There are cases where a UE delivers multiple instances of an MSD
to one or more PSAPs, for example as per 3GPP TS 22.101 clause 10.1.2.,
when an IMS emergency call based eCall attempt has not been successful
but the MSD was successfully received by a PSAP. It is out of the scope
of 3GPP as to how to manage any duplicate information received by the
PSAP(s) or emergency services as a result of this.

Additional data (i.e. data not contained in the initial MSD) may be
transferred at any time during the eCall (e.g. MSD acknowledgement,
resending of the MSD if requested by a PSAP).

The call setup time of an eCall shall be the same as for an IMS
emergency call.

The IVS shall not emit any audible tones in order to transfer the MSD or
other eCall related data.

A.27.4 Interworking requirements
--------------------------------

A PSAP, which is connected to the IMS, and supports either IMS emergency
call based eCall or TS12 based eCall, shall be able to interwork with a
TS12 based IVS using IMS Centralized Service, i.e. it shall be able to
terminate the emergency call from the IVS, receive the MSD and request
additional data from the IVS, using the eCall Modem end-to-end.

An IVS that supports IMS emergency call based eCalls shall also support
TS12 based eCalls.

An IVS that supports IMS emergency call based eCalls and is attached via
LTE access with no CS access available shall support the transfer of MSD
via IMS emergency call to a TS12 based PSAP using the eCall Modem
end-to-end.

NOTE 1: It is assumed that the above scenario is very unlikely to occur
on the market. Therefore the operation of eCall Modem over a PS bearer
should be considered as an option of last resort \[58\]. As such this is
not constrained by the requirements in A.27.2 and A.27.3.

In case of interworking between TS12 and IMS emergency call based eCall
equipment the requirements given in subclause A.27.2 shall apply,
requirements given in subclause A.27.3 do not apply.

A.27.5 Domain selection 
-----------------------

A PLMN shall indicate to an IVS whether IMS emergency call based eCalls
are supported.

An IVS that supports both IMS emergency call based eCalls and TS12 based
eCalls shall support domain selection for an eCall in the same way as
for any other emergency call except for determining PLMN support for an
IMS emergency based eCall using the PLMN indication for this.

A.28 Requirements for \"In Case of Emergency\" (ICE) information
----------------------------------------------------------------

The In Case of Emergency (ICE) information are used to enable first
responders, such as paramedics, fire-fighters, and police officers, to
contact a victim\'s emergency contact(s) in order to identify the victim
and obtain important medical information or other information required
during an emergency.

A UE shall have the capability to store one or more \"ICE information\"
on the UICC. The \"ICE information\" shall list the type of information
which is to be configured by the mobile operator as described in the
table below.

Provision is made for direct and unambiguous read access from the UE to
ICE information stored on the UICC.

The subscriber may choose not to enter any ICE information.

The default configuration for this information shall be that they are
accessible even when the security features on either the UE or UICC have
been enabled (e.g. the keypad is locked). **It shall be possible for the
subscriber to change this default setting to prevent accessibility to
the ICE information (i.e.** a user configurable setting in the UICC
indicates whether the ICE information on the UICC shall be displayed or
not, if the ICE access procedure described in TS 22.030 \[6\] is
invoked**).**

The unlocking of ICE information shall not allow access to other secure
information on the UICC or UE. The ICE information value should not be
accessible to ME or UICC applications.

The ICE access procedure is described in TS 22.030 \[6\].

######## Annex B (informative): Additional number use case

Company X is customer of operator Z and has a subscription for voice and
data with 10 SIM cards. The company also decides to subscribe to the
private numbering plan feature of operator Z. A certain corporate phone
number is assigned to company X, e.g. +43 676 88888 xx (with xx being
the extensions of the users), and they can freely choose the extensions
for up to 100 SIM cards.

Initially company X take the existing 10 SIM cards (with the existing
MSISDNs) and integrate them into the private numbering plan by assigning
the extensions 11 to 20 to these cards via a web portal. This is not a
permanent assignment, the extensions can be changed easily any time, old
SIMs can be deleted from the private numbering plan and new ones can be
integrated whenever necessary. Special privileges or restrictions can be
chosen on a per SIM basis via the portal and special tariffs apply.

The CEO of company X calls a customer. The customer\'s phone displays
the corporate number + extension of the CEO as CLI. After a while the
customer decides to call back the CEO and uses the corporate number +
extension as MSISDN. Later they also exchange some short messages, again
the corporate number + extension of the CEO is used as sender\'s MSISDN.

For all these calls and short messages operator Z is able to collect
charging records containing the corporate number + extension.

The CEO also uses her smart phone to establish PS connections to browse
the internet and to access the intranet via the operator\'s gateway. The
corporate number + extension is used for authentication and
authorisation in the company\'s intranet and its web applications.
Charging for PS connections by operator Z is also based on this number.

In general the users in company X are not aware of their \"real\"
underlying MSISDNs in the system, they only see the corporate number +
their extension and there is no need for them to know the underlying
MSISDN.
