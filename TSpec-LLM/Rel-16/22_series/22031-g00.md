1 Scope
=======

This Technical Specification specifies the stage 1 description of the
Fraud Information Gathering System (FIGS) feature which provides the
means for the HPLMN to monitor the activities of its subscribers in a
VPLMN.

The purpose of this network feature is to enable the HPLMN to monitor
the activities of its subscribers while they are roaming. The VPLMN
collects information about a defined set of activities on monitored
subscribers and sends this information back to the HPLMN. This enables
the HPLMN to clear certain types of calls and so stop fraudulent use of
the GSM system.

This specification enables service providers/ network operators to use
FIGS, and service limitation controls such as Operator Determined
Barring (ODB) and Immediate Service Termination (IST), to limit their
financial exposure to subscribers producing large unpaid bills.

HPLMNs may also choose to monitor the activities of its subscribers
within the HPLMN.

3 Definitions and abbreviations
===============================

3.1 Definitions
---------------

For the purposes of this specification the following definitions apply:

**A subscriber:** The calling mobile subscriber.

**B subscriber:** The mobile subscriber originally called by the A
subscriber.

**C subscriber:** The subscriber to whom the B subscriber has requested
that calls be forwarded. The C subscriber may be fixed or mobile.

**call**: both connection-oriented and connectionless services/events.

**call information**: information about a call.

**call reference**: a reference number for a call that shall remain
constant throughout the duration of that call and that shall be unique

4 Fraud Information Gathering System high level requirements
============================================================

4.1 Description
---------------

It shall be possible for the HPLMN to request the VPLMN to supply
certain information about a subscriber from the time the subscriber
registers in that VPLMN to the time the last of the monitored activities
is finished in that VPLMN, which can be after the subscriber's
de-registration from the VPLMN. The information received by the HPLMN
shall be passed to the relevant network or service providers and used to
instruct the VPLMN to act in an appropriate way.

Fraud information gathering is controlled by the HPLMN and can be
activated and deactivated by the HPLMN only.

The information is received in the HPLMN and is forwarded to fraud
detection and control systems. Such systems are out of the scope of this
standard.

The subscriber is specified by the IMSI or MSISDN.

4.2 Applicability
-----------------

This network feature applies to all subscribed Bearer Services and
Teleservices and supplementary services of the subscriber. It is not
possible to apply FIGS independently to individual Services.

The HPLMN shall be able to specify whether it would like call
information on MO calls, MT calls, or both.

4.3 Normal Procedure
--------------------

The HPLMN shall be able to request a VPLMN to monitor a subscriber.

See Annex A for the definition of the information to be sent for each
call event.

If the VPLMN cannot monitor the subscriber, it shall indicate this as a
response to the FIGS request.

The FDS will process this information and may then limit the activities
of the subscriber using ODB or terminate the subscriber activities using
IST, or may allow the subscriber to proceed.

When the home network no longer wishes the subscriber to be monitored by
the VPLMN it requests the VPLMN to stop monitoring the activities of the
subscriber.

Figure B.1 shows the sequence of FIGS messages passed during a normal
case.

5 Service conditions
====================

5.1 Control of monitoring of subscriber activities
--------------------------------------------------

The HPLMN can request a VPLMN to begin monitoring the activities of a
subscriber when the subscriber has registers on that VPLMN or at any
time after registration. If the VPLMN is able to monitor a subscriber as
requested it shall send a confirmation of monitoring message to the
HPLMN.

The HPLMN does not need to know the status of the target subscriber
before initiation or subsequent termination of fraud information
gathering.

Fraud information cannot be switched on or off by the subscriber or
other (unauthorised) party.

Subscribers upon which fraud information gathering has been set shall
not be able by interrogating the network to determine that they are
subject to fraud information gathering.

Subscribers upon which fraud information gathering has been set shall
not be able, for example by significant changes to normal call set up
times, speech quality or general transmission characteristics, to
determine that they are subject to fraud information gathering.

If the VPLMN receives a request to monitor the activities of a
subscriber and an activity to be monitored is already ongoing it is not
necessary for the VPLMN to send information on this particular activity
to the HPLMN.

If the VPLMN receives a request to cease monitoring the activities of a
subscriber and an activity is already ongoing and being monitored, the
VPLMN shall immediately cease sending information on this activity to
the HPLMN.

5.2 Number of calls monitored by a VPLMN
----------------------------------------

If the VPLMN has to monitor the activities of a large number of
subscribers for FIGS this may degrade the performance of the VPLMN. Each
VPLMN (in reality, each network entity involved in FIGS monitoring) will
therefore have a maximum number of subscribers that it can monitor.

If the number of monitored subscribers has reached this upper limit the
VPLMN shall reject requests for monitoring of subscribers from HPLMNs
until the number of monitored subscribers decreases below the limit.

Each VPLMN may have a limit per HPLMN on the number of subscribers from
that HPLMN that it will monitor. When an HPLMN has requested a VPLMN to
monitor a number of subscribers equal to the limit for that HPLMN, the
VPLMN can refuse any subsequent requests for FIGS monitoring from that
PLMN, until the number of monitored subscribers drops below the limit.
The principles behind the setting of these limits are outside the scope
of this specification.

In order to minimise the number of subscribers that a VPLMN has to
monitor, the HPLMN should ideally limit itself to requesting information
about subscriber\'s monitored activities in:

\- the current VPLMN;

\- the last previously served VPLMN.

5.3 Interworking with non-supporting networks
---------------------------------------------

If the HPLMN does not receive a positive acknowledgement to the request
for FIGS monitoring sent to a VPLMN, it shall assume that the VPLMN does
not support FIGS. The HPLMN may then act as appropriate (e.g. put
appropriate ODB categories in place).

5.4 Information Delivery Time
-----------------------------

The need for up to date information is a critical part of any fraud
information system. The sooner data is transferred to the HPLMN, the
sooner fraud can be stopped. Therefore the prescribed information shall
be transferred from the VPLMN network to the HPLMN within two minutes of
the occurrence of a FIGS-monitored event, if real time implementations
of FIGS are used.

The information should be transferred from the VPLMN to the HPLMN over
appropriate communication links.

6 Monitored activity
====================

The authorised party can request the VPLMN to monitor both call activity
and supplementary services.

The monitoring of call activity shall take the form of transmission of
call information from the VPLMN to the HPLMN, at the start and end of
all calls. For long calls, the VPLMN shall also send partial call
information a certain time (e.g. 15 minutes) after the call has begun.

Call information shall be sent to the HPLMN by the VPLMN on the
invocation of all supplementary services, e.g.:

\- call deflection;

\- call forwarding;

\- call hold;

\- Multi Party (MPTYY);

\- Explicit Call Transfer (ECT).

The HPLMN can decide to prevent future invocation of the same or all
supplementary services using ODB. The decision mechanism is out of the
scope of this specification.

7 Interface between HPLMN and FDS
=================================

Information gathered by the HPLMN may be transferred to Non‑GSM systems,
e.g. an FDS. These systems will decide if the monitored activity is
fraudulent and will advise the home network to take appropriate action,
e.g. send an IST command to the VPLMN, change the subscriber's ODB
categories.

The contents of call information messages to be transferred on this
interface shall be specified but not the transfer mechanism. This is in
line with the approach used for the X-interface as specified in
3GPP TS 42.033. The message formats are defined in annex A.

The system needs the ability to handle the volume of information
returned to the home network.

8 Security Requirements between HPLMN and VPLMN
===============================================

It is expected that there will be a need for authentication, data
integrity and confidentiality of the communication made between PLMNs.

These issues are for study under other work items within the SMG 10 work
programme.

######## Annex A (normative): Information transferred by the VPLMN

The reports generated by the VPLMN shall take the form of \"call
information" records for each monitored subscriber. The content of the
call information will depend on the type of event (call start, end
etc.). To simplify matters, there will be one format for both MO and MT
calls with an MO/MT indicator within the call information to distinguish
between the two.

A partial call information will be sent to the HPLMN when there is an
mid-call invocation of a supplementary service and when a call in
progress has exceeded a defined duration.

Justification is given for the content of the call information message.

Table A.1: Call information content

  -----------------------
  Information
  Dialled digits
  A subscriber
  B subscriber
  C subscriber
  CGI
  IMSI
  IMEI
  Call Start Time/Date
  Call Duration
  Call Reference
  MO/MT indicator
  Visited MSC address
  Type of SS event
  Type of Basic Service
  -----------------------

The **Dialled digits** are required as these are an important indicator
in deciding if a call is fraudulent or not - certain call destinations
are more likely to be called fraudulently than others.

**A subscriber** can be used to identify the subscriber

**B, C subscriber** are relevant as some call destinations are more
subject to fraud than others.

Cell Global Identifier (**CGI**) is relevant as some cells in a PLMN are
more subject to fraud than others.

The **IMSI** is used to reference the subscriber.

The **IMEI** can be used to check if a stolen handset has been used.

The **Call Start Time/Date** is required so that the call duration can
be calculated (if the call end time and not call duration is given at
call conclusion) and because the call start time can also an important
indicator of fraudulency.

The **Call Duration** gives the duration of the call at the sending of
the partial call information - call duration can be an important
indicator of fraudulency. If call end is sent instead, the duration can
be calculated using the call start and end times.

The **Call Reference** is used to reference a particular call.

The **MO/MT indicator** is required because call charging is different
for MO and MT calls.

The **Visited MSC address** gives the PLMN on which the call was made.

The **Type of SS event** record is sent if the "call" start is actually
the invocation of a supplementary service, e.g. ECT. The Type of SS
event is required as this can help to indicate if the mobile is being
fraudulently used or not.

The **Type of Basic Service** indicates whether a teleservice or bearer
service is being used and which sort of teleservice or bearer service is
being used and is sent if the event is a call and not a supplementary
service. The Type of Basic Service is required as this can help to
indicate if the mobile station is being fraudulently used or not.
