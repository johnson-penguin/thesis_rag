3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.

y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e.
technical enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.

z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been
incorporated in the document.

1 Scope
=======

This technical report relates to a study on positioning use cases for
both outdoor and indoor environments. It analyses positioning use cases
and complements existing work on 5G use cases involving positioning
needs in order to identify potential requirements for 5G positioning
services.

This document also identifies new use cases, their scope and environment
of use along with the related KPIs. For use cases already addressed
(fully or partially) in other 3GPP studies, it consolidates and
validates the KPI and assumptions.

The document further develops the identified use cases by providing some
considerations on the suitability of positioning technologies to these
use cases. These considerations support the identification of potential
requirements that can be achieved with 3GPP positioning technologies or
with a combination of 3GPP and non-3GPP positioning technologies. The
use cases and performance targets are independent of specific solutions
even though, in order to support these considerations, the report
provides some illustrative allocation between existing positioning
technologies and 3GPP new positioning technologies (e.g. NR-based).

4 Overview
==========

Clause 5 describes the positioning use cases, categorized by verticals,
as follows:

\- Regulatory (e.g. emergency call, LI)

\- Mission Critical

\- Location-Based Services (e.g. LCS, gaming, social networking,
position-enabled advertisement)

\- Industry and eHealth (e.g. automation, asset management and tracking,
device telemetry -- metering, patient monitoring)

\- Road (e.g. vehicle environment, road-user charging)

\- Railway

\- Maritime

\- Aerials (e.g. UAV/UAS)

\- Others

A synthesis of all the use cases requirements is provided in Clause 6
summarising targets for positioning services along with a grouping of
some use cases, when this grouping is possible and relevant.

Clause 7 develops some considerations on the suitability of positioning
technologies for the identified use cases, considering both 3GPP and
non-3GPP positioning technologies. The related mapping builds on a
background material to reveal the use cases that can be covered by
existing technologies (standalone or combined) and the use cases for
which 3GPP new positioning technologies (e.g. NR-enabled) are needed to
cope with the shortcomings of existing technologies.

Clause 8 identifies initial potential requirements for 5G positioning
services based on the considerations developed in Clause 7.

5 Use cases
===========

5.1 Foreword
------------

### 5.1.1 Key Performance Indicators and Key attributes for positioning use cases

The following KPI apply to the definition of the use-cases positioning
requirements:

\- **Position accuracy**: describes the closeness of the measured
position of the UE to its true position value. The accuracy can describe
the accuracy either of an absolute position or of a relative position.
It can be further derived into a horizontal position accuracy --
referring to the position error in a 2D reference or horizontal plane,
and into a vertical position accuracy -- referring to the position error
on the vertical axis or altitude.

\- **Speed accuracy**: describes the closeness of the measured magnitude
of the UE's velocity to the true magnitude of the UE's velocity.

\- **Bearing accuracy**: describes the closeness of the measured bearing
of the UE to its true bearing. Both the measured and the true bearing
are defined in a common base coordinate system, using yaw-pitch-roll as
for aircraft principal axes. For a moving UE, the bearing is a measure
of the velocity's direction and this KPI can be combined with speed
accuracy into the velocity's accuracy.

\- **Timestamp accuracy**: the position-related data (e.g. position,
velocity) are usually associated to a timestamp, marking the time when
the position-related data has been determined. The timestamp accuracy
describes the closeness of the timestamp value to the true instant when
the related data was computed.

\- **Availability**: percentage of time when a positioning system is
able to provide the required position-related data within the
performance targets or requirements.

\- **Latency**: time elapsed between the event that triggers the
determination of the position-related data and the availability of the
position-related data at the positioning system interface. At
initialisation of the positioning system, the latency is also defined as
the Time to First Fix.

\- **Time to First Fix (TTFF)**: time elapsed between the event
triggering for the first time the determination of the position-related
data and the availability of the position-related data at the
positioning system interface. TTTF is greater or equal to Latency.

\- **Update rate**: rate at which the position-related data is generated
by the positioning system. It is the inverse of the time elapsed between
two successive position-related data.

**- Power consumption**: electrical power (usually in mW) used by the
positioning system to produce the position-related data.

**- Energy per Fix**: electrical energy (usually in mJ per fix) used by
the positioning system to produce the position-related data. It
represents the integrated power consumption of the positioning system
over the required processing interval. It considers both the processing
energy and the energy used during the idle state between two successive
productions of position-related data. This KPI can advantageously
replace the power consumption when the positioning system is not active
continuously (e.g. device tracking).

**- System scalability**: amount of devices for which the positioning
system can determine the position-related data in a given time unit,
and/or for a specific update rate.

The aforementioned Key Performance Indicators can be dependent of the
UE's dynamic and/or dependent of its location in the cell. The KPI
defines a target either for each dependence, or for the worst-case.

Furthermore, some applications can have specific needs in terms of
insurance of the quality of service, usually addressed in dedicated
certification process and standards outside 3GPP. Most of the time,
these applications are safety-critical or liability-critical
applications.

For the purpose of this document, the following additional KPIs can be
considered on a case-by-case basis.

**- Continuity**: likelihood that the positioning system functionality
will be available during the complete duration of the intended operation
if the positioning system is operational at the beginning of the
operation.

**- Reliability**: measure of the ability of a positioning system to
provide the position-related data under stated conditions for a
specified period.

**- Integrity**: measure of the trust in the accuracy of the
position-related data provided by the positioning system and the ability
to provide timely and valid warnings to the UE and/or the user when the
positioning system does not fulfil the condition for intended operation.

**- Time to alert**: time elapsed between a change of the integrity (as
defined above) and the information to the UE and/or the user.

**- Authentication**: provision of assurance that the position-related
data associated with the UE has been derived from trusted and authorised
sources (e.g. real signals and not falsified signals). This KPI is
different from security, which defines the measures to ensure that the
position-related data is safeguarded against unapproved disclosure or
usage inside or outside the positioning-system. Because it cannot be
summarised and quantified as a scalar target, this KPI is managed as a
binary field in the present report: yes or no provision of positioning
authentication is needed.

**- Security / Privacy**: measures to ensure that the position-related
data is safeguarded against unapproved disclosure or usage inside or
outside the positioning system and/or to ensure that a non-authorized
party cannot access information relating to the privacy of the user.
Because it cannot be summarised and quantified as a scalar target, this
KPI is managed as a binary field in the present report: yes or no
security and/or privacy is needed.

In addition to the aforementioned KPIs, the use cases' description can
consider the following key attributes, because they affect significantly
the positioning performances and operating conditions of the related
technologies:

**- Environment of use**: the physical environment in which the UE
operates. It describes the service area or volume (e.g. building, cell
or network coverage, regional, global coverage) as well as the
high-level properties affecting radiofrequency propagation and
positioning such as the nature of the service area (open i.e. no
obstruction, aerial, sub-urban, canyons urban or natural, indoor
including tunnels). In case of multiple environments, the attribute
shall also define whether the use case is expected to operate seamlessly
in all these environments.

\- **5G positioning service area** - a service area where positioning
services would solely rely on infrastructures and positioning
technologies that can be assumed to be present anywhere where 5G is
present (e.g. a country-wide operator-supplied 5G network, GNSS,
position/motion sensors). It corresponds to the so-called "identical
communication and positioning coverage area" in 5.55 from 3GPP TR
22.891-e20 (Feasibility study on New Services and Markets Technology
Enablers). This includes both indoor and outdoor environment, and for
the latter, any outdoor environment (rural with low density of node but
little obstruction, urban with high density of node and obstruction by
building, etc.). The 5G positioning service area can be considered for
use cases that must work in any 5G environment, for example in any
building -- commercial, public or residential alike -- e.g. to localize
a patient getting a heart attack in an apartment building

\- **Bounded service area** or **Dedicated service area** - a subset of
the 5G positioning service area where specific positioning services can
be provided (e.g. enhanced performances when compared to the
performances achieved in the whole 5G positioning service area).

\- **Enhanced positioning area** - a subset of the 5G positioning
service area that is assumed to be provided with additional
infrastructure or deploy a particular set of positioning technologies to
enhance positioning services. It corresponds to the term "Enhanced
positioning coverage area" in 5.55 from 3GPP TR 22.891-e20 (Feasibility
study on New Services and Markets Technology Enablers). For example, a
hospital (campus) could be equipped to enable tracking of patients,
personnel and assets throughout the hospital with improved accuracy and
availability (e.g. using a higher density of small cells, nodes or WLAN
access points). This additional infrastructure could use a combination
of 3GPP technologies and non-3GPP technologies, and cover both indoor
and outdoor environments.

**- UE dynamic**: the UE can be either static or moving. In the latter,
the attribute shall also provide some elements about its motion, e.g.
maximum speed, trajectory.

**- UE density**: defined as the number of UEs per km².

**- Consideration on positioning sources (or reference nodes) density
with impact on positioning KPI** - for example, some use case may
consider a specific density or deployment to improve KPI target in a
well-defined service area (e.g. hospitals, factory floor, etc.).

5.2 LBS-related use cases
-------------------------

### 5.2.1 Accurate positioning for shared bikes

#### 5.2.1.1 Description

The shared bike service allows a rider to rent a bike via a mobile app
and drop it off anywhere for the next user. The accurate locations of
shared bikes are available in the mobile app for the riders to find the
nearest bike.

This service offers the citizens a cheap and convenient way for city
trip. However, the ruthless management of bike parking will cause the
problems such as blocking sidewalks. Electronic fence is used as a tool
for regulating the parked bikes, and it requires high accuracy
positioning of shared bikes.

#### 5.2.1.2 Pre-conditions

Tom downloads an app on his smart phone, which allows him to locate and
unlock a nearby shared bike.

The shared bikes are equipped with 5G communication modules, smart lock
as well as a 5G positioning module. This positioning module can use a
combination of 3GPP technologies and non-3GPP technologies. This
includes, but not limited to, GNSS (e.g. BeiDou, Galileo, GLONASS, and
GPS), Terrestrial Beacon Systems (TBS), Bluetooth, WLAN, RFID, and
sensors.

The parking areas are categorized as strictly parking-controlled areas
and non-strictly parking-controlled areas.

For strictly parking-controlled areas which are mainly near bus hubs,
subway stations and shopping centres, riders who park bikes outside the
allowed areas (i.e., electronic areas) cannot lock them and will
continue to be charged.

For non-strictly parking-controlled areas, instead of being forced,
riders are just encouraged to park at any public bike rack or public
location that does not interfere with pedestrians or traffic.

#### 5.2.1.3 Service Flows

1\. Tom locates a nearby shared bike and unlocks it to start the trip.
5G provides positioning service with 2m horizontal position accuracy,
90% availability, less than 1s latency.

2\. Tom rides the bike to the destination at the speed of 15-20km/hour,
and during the trip the bike will report its location to the server
frequently. 5G provides positioning service with 2m horizontal position
accuracy, 90% availability, less than 1s latency.

3\. Tom has completed his trip.

a\) If the parking area is non-strictly parking-controlled area, Tom
could park the bike freely at any public location and then lock the
bike. The bike reports its location to server. 5G provides positioning
service with 2m horizontal position accuracy, 90% availability, less
than 1s latency.

b\) If the parking area is strictly parking-controlled area, the mobile
app will indicate him to park the bike in a designated electronic fence
nearby. Otherwise, Tom cannot lock the bike and will continue to be
charged. The app needs to check if the bike is precisely parked into the
dedicated area. 5G provides a positioning service with 0.2m horizontal
position accuracy, 99% availability, less than 1s latency.

#### 5.2.1.4 Post-conditions

\[Editor\'s Note: text to be provided or \"None\" to be stated\]

#### 5.2.1.5 Potential Impacts or Interactions with Existing Services/Features

\[Editor\'s Note: text to be provided or \"None\" to be stated\]

#### 5.2.1.6 Potential Requirements

The 5G system shall be able to provide a positioning service with 2m
horizontal position accuracy, 90% availability, and less than 1s latency
for the moving UE at the speed of 15-20km/hour outdoor.

The 5G system shall be able to provide a positioning service with 0.2m
horizontal position accuracy,99% availability, and less than 1s latency
for the static UE in a enhanced positioning area outdoor.

The 5G System shall be able to provide a positioning service with a TTFF
less than \[10\] s

### 5.2.2 Accurate positioning to support Augmented Reality (AR)

#### 5.2.2.1 Description

Augmented reality (AR) goggles and Head-up displays (HUD) superpose
contextual information relating to the user's position and motion on the
user's field of view. AR goggles allow, for instance, the user to
navigate, record video, identify targets and gather information about
the surrounding environment for improved performance. They also allow
the user to communicate with other users by sharing location and sending
messages or communicate with those at home privately or on social media
by sharing live video.

AR is enabled by the knowledge of the user's position, motion and
eventually, direction of view, and by access, with low latency, to
databases of contextual information and geo-localized information
systems (GIS). All users willing to interact with each other in an AR
application should be equipped and communicate among each other with low
latency.

In the field of LBS, AR supports multiple applications, including
outdoor sports and leisure activities (skiing, motorcycling, sailing,
surfing, rally, aviation and gaming) as well as social networking.
Information about the weather conditions such as strength of wind or
depth of snow layer may improve performance and help prevent dangerous
situations such as avalanches. AR may also support "Blue forces", like
firefighters, that need to know real-time information about the fire
such as temperature and severity of smoke, identify targets, safe
location, etc. This area is not covered is the current use case.

At least for gaming and sports applications, the position-related data
need to be secured and protected against tampering to dissuade from any
attempt to fraud or cheat.

#### 5.2.2.2 Pre-conditions

The UE comprises at least a self-powered AR goggles, associated to a 5G
communication module and a 5G positioning module. The 5G modules can be
integrated in the goggles or held by the user and connected to the
goggles.

The users have access to the AR Application Server through a 5G Network.
The AR Application Server has access to all relevant contextual
information, including maps of the user's surrounding. Mapping and
establishment of contextual information database are done beforehand.

#### 5.2.2.3 Service Flows

The user turns on the UE, and allows the system to initialise and
eventually calibrate (e.g. heading, field of view).

The 5G positioning module enables the 3GPP system to determine position,
velocity and goggles heading at a high rate. The frequency of the
determination may vary according to the application requirements. This
information is reported to the AR Application Server to provide the AR
goggles with contextual information.

While moving, the user visualises messages and contextual information on
the screen of the goggle. He can use the navigation feature to find a
specific location or a target, follow a friend or pursue a track (for
instance, a ski track, a route, etc.). He can use the communication
feature to find out where friends or colleagues are and what they want
to do next. He can also share live video to social media, or to a
hospital in the case of an emergency.

The user can use the additional information available on the screen of
the goggle to find out where it is best to go next for a safer and more
enjoyable journey. This information can be a weather report, heart rate,
steepness of slopes, altitude, temperature of the surroundings, etc.

#### 5.2.2.4 Post-conditions

\[Editor\'s Note: text to be provided or \"None\" to be stated\]

data against tampering and spoofing.

The 5G System shall support mechanisms to detect tampering and spoofing
attempts on the position-related data.

The 5G System shall be able to ensure the positioning related data are

### 5.2.3 Power saving mechanism of wearable devices

#### 5.2.3.1 Description

Wearable device applications are becoming more and more grateful. Some
of the top wearable device manufacturers are constantly providing new
features, such as smart watches. For some areas, smart watches can
replace mobile terminals to provide basic services, such a tracking,
activity monitoring and emergency messages, especially for minors or the
elderly people. Smart terminals focus on providing location services and
provide better positioning and monitoring functions for these
populations. But these wearable devices require higher power durability.

#### 5.2.3.2 Pre-conditions

Ryder is a minor, and his parents want to monitor his location by a
smart watch. His range of motion is regular but calls for different
working point of the monitoring function:

\- When Ryder is in school, his environment's security is relatively
high and there is less need for continuous monitoring of his location.

\- When Ryder is outside school, in various environment less secured
than the school, it is desirable for his parents to monitor continuously
his location.

Ryder wears a smart watch. As a 5G UE, it is equipped with 5G
communication and 5G positioning modules.

\- Wearable devices, such as smart watches, can be accessed into a macro
network or any 5G enabled access network.

\- Intelligent control terminals, such as mobile phones and pad, access
to the same network, and to monitor the location of the selected
wearable devices. They run a monitoring function making them a
monitoring terminal.

\- A security range set, Ryder's parents using the monitoring terminal
may access the 5G network and set the security area on the positioning
modules.

#### 5.2.3.3 Service Flows

1\. The monitoring terminal (that is an intelligent control terminal)
sets one or several security ranges through the network. The security
ranges are stored in the positioning modules of network.

2\. Ryder enters his school, identified as one of the security range in
the positioning modules of the network. His current location is
determined and available to the network. The smart watch is informed to
switch into the power-saving mode.

3\. The position update rate of the smart watch is reduced, lengthening
the update interval to save power.

4\. Ryder arrives at the school boundary or crosses the boundary. The
smart watch returns to its normal position update rate, according to the
network instruction.

#### 5.2.3.4 Post-conditions

Power normal mode, is that the smart watch provides the nominal
positioning update rate in areas where continuous monitoring is needed,
with an update interval of the position between 1s and 10s. And if the
UE is in the normal mode, the positioning service update is 2m
horizontal position accuracy, 99% availability, and less than 1s
latency.

Power saving mode, is that the smart watch switch to power saving mode
with lower update rate when the user is in secured or trusted ranges,
with an update interval of the position between 30s and 300s. By
adapting its positioning update rate to the effective monitoring needs,
the smart watch lengthens its battery lifetime. And if the UE is in the
power saving mode, the positioning service update is 2m horizontal
position accuracy, 90% availability, and less than 1s latency.

The use case could be expanded to other verticals and categories, for
instance e-health for patient tracking, industry for mobile security
monitoring, etc.

#### 5.2.3.5 Potential Impacts or Interactions with Existing Services/Features

None identified.

#### 5.2.3.6 \[Potential\] Requirements

The 5G system shall be able to provide positioning service with 2m
horizontal position accuracy, indoor \[1-3\] m vertical position
accuracy, 90% availability, and less than 1s latency for the UE in the
location power saving mode.

The 5G system shall be able to provide positioning service with 2m
horizontal position accuracy, indoor \[1-3\] m vertical position
accuracy, 99% availability, and less than 1s latency for the UE in
normal mode.

The 5G System shall be able to request the UE to provide its location
periodically with an update rate ranging from one location every
\[1s-10s\] in location normal mode to one location every \[30s-300s\] in
location power saving mode.

The 5G network shall be able to request the UE to provide its location
wherever it is indoor or outdoor.

The 5G System shall be able to provide positioning service with TTFF
less than \[10\] s.

### 5.2.4 Location-based advertising push

#### 5.2.4.1 Description

Data mining has been widely used in OTT (over the top). However,
operators do not have a flexible mechanism to apply location data.
People's activity is regular and causal. According to the records of the
UE's location in a period of time, comfort active areas can be formed.
People don\'t want to be bothered by unnecessary advertisements, except
things that are closely related to themselves in the comfort active
areas. Therefore, data analysis based on human activity location needs
to be introduced into location-based advertising push.

#### 5.2.4.2 Pre-conditions

Users of the 5G network are equipped with 5G communication module, as
well as a 5G positioning module. This positioning module can use a
combination of 3GPP technologies and non-3GPP technologies. This
includes, but not limited to, GNSS (e.g. BeiDou, Galileo, GLONASS, and
GPS), Terrestrial Beacon Systems (TBS), sensors, WLAN, and
Bluetooth-based positioning.

In the network, there will be user location analysis equipment. Users of
the 5G network periodic send location to the network. Their daily
location habits will be recorded into the analysis equipment. The
analysis of equipment will form a comfortable area of activity.

Operators have business location and advertising information in the
comfort active area.

#### 5.2.4.3 Service Flows

1\. Ryder uses 5G terminals, and often goes to the local supermarket
near home.

2\. He also plays football every week.

3\. And stick to the training centre to learn Spanish.

4\. His locations form the triangle region at the top of these three
places.

5\. The network analysis the comfort active area according to his
locations and residence time.

6\. The operator extracts the location and advertising information of
shops in his comfort area based on the analysis of his locations and
residence time.

7\. For example, Ryder often stays on the football field. Therefore, the
network extracts the advertising information of some football related
stores.

8\. The network pushes him discount information on nearby local
supermarkets and drink price tips for use during the football match in
bars in the neighbourhood.

#### 5.2.4.4 Post-conditions

None identified.

#### 5.2.4.5 Potential Impacts or Interactions with Existing Services/Features

None identified.

#### 5.2.4.6 \[Potential\] Requirements

Subject to regulatory requirements and user consent, the 5G System shall
be able to provide the UE's location information, with less than 3m
horizontal position accuracy, \[3 m\] vertical position accuracy, over
90% availability, and less than 1min latency.

### 5.2.5 Flow management in large transportation hubs

#### 5.2.5.1 Description

Airports are getting bigger and busier which calls for efficient flow
management to maximise punctuality to the benefit of passengers and
airline companies. By using a location-based mobile application, the
passengers can easily find their way around, even in unknown airports
and in a hurry, reducing time of transit in the airport and lowering
risk of delays and missed connections. In the eventuality of work or
maintenance performed in the passengers' halls, the application will
propose alternative routes to passengers.

Airline companies can be informed, by the airport and the application
server, of their passengers' situation in near real-time: they can use
the information to optimise their embarking operations and reduce risk
for last minutes call to gate, flight delays because of one passenger,
etc.

Using passengers' location information, the airport will be able to
elaborate statistics on passengers flow to optimise their organisation
and signalling to passenger.

By extension, the use case may encompasses applications for any
transportation hub (metro or rail station, etc.) facing large passenger
flows, connection and transit time issues.

#### 5.2.5.2 Pre-conditions

The passenger has a UE equipped with 5G communication modules, and 5G
positioning module.

The passenger downloads a mobile application to his UE allowing him to
find the quickest way to the gate, define a transit route accounting for
his personal needs and matters (shopping, lunch, etc.) as well as for
the need to proceed with security controls.

The application server has access to all relevant contextual
information, including a map of the airport, flight information, and
estimates transit time between different locations in the airport,
including waiting time of security lines.

Mapping and establishment of contextual information database are done
beforehand and updated in near-real time with the information reported
by the users.

#### 5.2.5.3 Service Flows

1\. The passenger turns on the application as he reaches the airport.

2\. The application will suggest an itinerary to the gate of departure
depending on preferences of the passenger (as quickly as possible, as
little walking as possible, wheelchair friendly, shopping friendly,
etc.).

3\. The passenger will be notified of the estimated time to reach the
gate, if there is a change of gate, time of departure or congestion or
queues in some areas. The application will suggest a new route if
relevant. The information in the application is provided in the language
of preference of the passenger.

4\. The passenger can use the app to find specific locations in the
airport such as information desks, bathrooms, elevators, restaurants,
shops, taxis, etc.

5\. Based on the location of the passenger, the app can mark an alert if
he is short of time and needs to proceed to the gate immediately.

6\. In real time, airport and airlines operations are notified if
passengers are delayed within their transit into the airport, or if they
face risk of being delayed (security control, shopping, etc.). They have
access to estimations of the expected time the passenger will need to
reach gate (considering its effective position and real time flow
estimation). They can use the information to organise individual call to
gate (last minute calls, etc.) and make the overall flow more fluent.

#### 5.2.5.4 Post-conditions

Passengers can get to their gates more quickly, which reduces time of
transit and time of travel in general. This will reduce delays, improve
customer experience and optimise airport operations.

Airport authority and airline companies optimise their operations thanks
to low management and improve their punctuality and efficiency.

#### 5.2.5.5 Potential Impacts or Interactions with Existing Services/Features

#### 5.2.5.6 Potential Requirements

The 5G system shall be able to provide positioning service with better
than \[10\] m horizontal positioning accuracy, \[80\] % availability and
update rate of \[0.1\] Hz in a enhanced positioning area, primarily
indoor.

The 5G system shall be able to provide positioning service with better
than \[3\] m vertical positioning accuracy, \[80\] % availability and
update rate of \[0.1\] Hz in a enhanced positioning area, primarily
indoor.

The 5G System shall be able to provide positioning service with TTFF
less than \[10\] s.

The 5G System shall be able to ensure the protection and the privacy of
the user's position-related data.

The 5G System shall be able to provide indication of the user's motion
(velocity, bearing).

5.3 Industry and eHealth related use cases 
------------------------------------------

### 5.3.1 Person and medical equipment location in hospitals

#### 5.3.1.1 Description

In some hospitals like psychiatry or geriatrics, it is necessary to
locate the patients in real time on the site of the hospitals (indoor
and outdoor) and to notify the medical staff if the patients reach a
non-authorised area in order to avoid runaway patients.

Additionally, it is necessary to locate caregivers and medical equipment
(e.g. crash cart), especially in emergency situations.

It is necessary to take into account the environment of hospitals: some
are made up of several buildings on several hectares with large green
areas and others are buildings of several floors and basements.

#### 5.3.1.2 Pre-conditions

The patient wears a device, e.g. a wrist-band which supports some
mechanisms to obtain its location, as part of a 5G positioning module.
The caregiver carries a mobile phone or tablet. The medical equipment
has a built-in 5G positioning module. It is assumed that the 5G
positioning module is linked to a communication module together forming
a UE. The positioning module can use a combination of 3GPP technologies
and non-3GPP technologies. The positioning module and related
communication module have to be able to operate with very low energy
consumption, given that the device in which it is used (e.g. patient
worn wrist band) may have very limited battery and form factor.

NOTE: the hospital can be considered an enhanced positioning area.

#### 5.3.1.3 Service Flows

The UE enables the 3GPP system to determine its current location in a
periodic or an event-triggered manner. The frequency of the location
reporting may change according to the application requirements.

The UE reports location information that may include its applicable
Equipment Identity. At any time, upon request, the UE shall be able to
report its location information.

External systems can provide additional information to the Hospital
System in order to improve location accuracy of a UE.

In case of periodic location reporting, the Hospital System supervises
the continuous supply of the location information.

The received location information is stored by Hospital System.

#### 5.3.1.4 Post-conditions

The location information of the person or medical equipment is available
in the Hospital System.

#### 5.3.1.5 Potential Requirements

The UE shall be able to provide its location to the Hospital System.

The 5G System shall be able to request the UE to provide its location.

The 5G System shall be able to request the UE to provide its location
periodically.

The 5G System shall be able to request the UE to stop providing its
location periodically.

The 5G System shall be able to handle additional location information
from other external sources.

The 5G System shall be able to provide positioning service with a
horizontal accuracy less than \[3 m\], a vertical accuracy less than \[2
m\] (i.e. floor accurate), an availability over \[99%\] and a latency
lower than \[1 minute\]. The environment of use for the provision of the
service shall be both indoor (including underground) and outdoor within
the boundaries of the Hospital.

The 5G System shall support positioning of UEs using very little energy
consumption on the UE.

NOTE1: the solution should consider UEs with limited form factor,
limited CPU power, limited peak power, and limited radio access
technology support (e.g. eMTC type communication only).

NOTE2: The aforementioned potential requirements do not preclude whether
the position is computed in the UE or elsewhere in the 5G System (e.g.
core network). Indeed, the determination of the UE's position or
location requires the UE to transmit some information (e.g. position,
OTDOA measurements made on PRS, some signal allowing the UE's
identification and UTDOA measurements in the nodes, etc.) which refers
to position-related data.

### 5.3.2 Patient location outside hospitals 

#### 5.3.2.1 Description

In some hospitals like psychiatry or geriatrics, it is necessary to
locate the patients in real time to notify the medical staff if the
patient reaches a non-authorised area in order to avoid runaway
patients.

When a patient manages to leave the hospital without authorisation, it
is necessary to locate him (in a city and in rural area) in order to
bring him back to the hospital.

Additionally, ambulatory patients with a potentially critical condition
(e.g. cardiac, diabetes, high-risk pregnancy), as well as frail elderly,
need to be localized in case their condition gets critical (e.g. elderly
falling).

#### 5.3.2.2 Pre-conditions

The patient wears a device containing a 5G communication module, and a
5G positioning module. This positioning module can use a combination of
3GPP technologies and non-3GPP technologies. The patient's wearable
device should have a battery life of at least several days.

#### 5.3.2.3 Service Flows

The 5G positioning module enables the 3GPP system to determine its
current location in a periodic or an event-triggered manner. The
frequency of the location reporting may change according to the
application requirements.

The 5G positioning module reports location information that may include
its applicable Equipment Identity. At any time, upon request, the 5G
positioning module shall be able to report its location information.

External systems can provide additional information to the Hospital
System in order to improve location accuracy of a 5G positioning module.

In case of periodic location reporting, the Hospital System supervises
the continuous supply of the location information.

Hospital System stores the received location information.

#### 5.3.2.4 Post-conditions

The medical staff localizes the patient.

#### 5.3.2.5 \[Potential\] Requirements

The 5G System shall be able to provide positioning service with a
horizontal accuracy less than \[10\] m both indoors and outdoors.
Furthermore, for indoors, the 5G System shall be able to provide
positioning service with a vertical accuracy sufficiently accurate to
determine the floor, so typically less than \[3\] m. This localization
accuracy needs to be achieved throughout the 5G positioning service
area.

### 5.3.3 Trolley location in factories

#### 5.3.3.1 Description

Factories use mobile trolleys and it is necessary to monitor their
location and track the movement of these trolleys.

It is necessary to take into account the environment of factories:
buildings have several floors and may have deep basement, some factories
are made up of several buildings distributed over several hectares (e.g.
campus with large green areas, trees, etc.). In addition, factories may
be spread over several sites in vicinity.

In addition, exchanges of trolleys between factories are possible, and
this includes exchanges between international locations: it shall
therefore be ensured that the monitoring may be enabled in multiple
locations, including in different countries.

#### 5.3.3.2 Pre-conditions

The trolleys are equipped with 5G communication modules, smart lock as
well as a 5G positioning module. This positioning module can use a
combination of 3GPP technologies and non-3GPP technologies.

#### 5.3.3.3 Service Flows

The 5G system shall be able to determine the current location of the UE
in a periodic or an event-triggered manner. The frequency of the
location reporting may change according to the application requirements.
The 5G communication module reports location information that may
include its applicable Equipment Identity. At any time, upon request,
the 5G communication modules shall be able to report its location
information.

External systems can provide additional information to the Factory
System in order to improve location accuracy of 5G modules.

In case of periodic location reporting, the Factory System supervises
the continuous supply of the location information.

The Factory System stores the received location information.

#### 5.3.3.4 Post-conditions

The location information for the connected trolley is always accessible
in the Factory System.

#### 5.3.3.5 \[Potential\] Requirements

The 5G system shall be able to provide positioning service with \[50\]
cm horizontal position accuracy, \[1-3\] m vertical position accuracy,
and less than \[20\] ms latency for the moving UE at the speed of \[50\]
km/hour indoor, taking into account at least a service area from \[1 000
to 100 000\] m².

The 5G system shall be able to provide positioning service in case of
roaming.

### 5.3.4 Waste Management & Collection

#### 5.3.4.1 Description

Cities and urban population are expending and growing generating more
and more waste to be managed and collected. Traditionally, waste
collection was organized on fixed schedules through a given route,
whether containers were full, partially full or even empty.

In order to reduce costs as well as to reduce drastically the impacts on
the environment, municipalities are required to have smarter waste
collection and management which is more efficient and optimize in
particular the collection route.

Residential bins are including sensors that can signal when they need to
be emptied. The routes taken by waste collection vehicles can then be
optimised accordingly.

The connected bins can be configured to only send a message when they
are full or to send updates once a day or even on a more regular basis
(typically every 2 hours which could be configurable to 3h, 6h\...).
This allows for the reduction in number of vehicles needed for waste
collection and thereby curbs greenhouse gas emissions. The sensors can
also detect fires in the bins and send an alarm accordingly.

Trucks and vehicles in charge of the waste collection are equipped with
positioning technology and can be send based on dedicated route to
collect only the bins that have to be collected. In particular cases,
some of these vehicles equipped to handle particular waste can be easily
diverted to address urgent needs.

Furthermore, there are more and more waste containers not only for
residential use but as well for use for retail stores, restaurants,
hotels, etc. and other uses such as construction or building sites. For
this particular case, very often these containers are not on a regular
position and are moved to new site as soon as they are not needed
anymore in their previous site. Companies that are managing many waste
containers need then to know where are their containers to be able to
re-allocate them when their use for a particular need is done.

#### 5.3.4.2 Pre-conditions

The waste bins and containers are equipped with a UE including a 5G
communication module, as well as a 5G positioning module. This location
equipment supports some mechanisms to allow the 5G System to determine
the bin's (or container's) position either on demand or on a regular
basis.

The waste collection vehicles are equipped with on-board unit including
a 5G communication module, as well as a 5G positioning module.

The two aforementioned positioning modules can use a combination of 3GPP
technologies and non-3GPP technologies such as GNSS (e.g. BeiDou,
Galileo, GLONASS, and GPS), Terrestrial Beacon Systems (TBS), sensors,
WLAN, and Bluetooth-based positioning.

The 5G system is interfaced to an application server (e.g. Waste
Management and Collection System).

#### 5.3.4.3 Service Flows

The waste collection teams prepare their work plan. For that, they
download information from the Waste Management and Collection System,
these includes information relating to the waste bins and containers
under their responsibility and supposed to be located in their area of
work: filling percentage, most recent use (e.g. bin opening and
evolution of filling following opening), position (or most recent
positions log)

The Waste Management and Collection System determines whether the bins
needs to be collected (it is full, it is expected to be full within the
week, it is not full, but is rarely filled, therefore content may
degrade and generate inconvenience to the neighbourhood: bad smell,
animals trying to get bins content, etc.).

It also identifies a few container with waste requiring some specific
handling as per regulation. The Waste Management and Collection System
checks the identification and location of the container to verify if
these are in line with regulation, and to check if owner is indeed
complying with regulation.

If a bin or container is identified in the wrong place, the Waste
Management and Collection System reports the incident, and notifies its
owner to dissuade him from using the bin beyond its purpose. The Waste
Management and Collection System may consider charging more the owner.

Knowing the bins and container to be collected, as well as the
estimation of waste, the Waste Management and Collection System can
determine the optimal work plan for the collect: number of vehicles
involved, their trajectory, as well as their size and type tailored to
the quantity and type of waste to be collected.

With the plan established, the team start the collect. They follow the
scheduled work plan and route, guided in this thanks to the trucks
position which is also determined by the 5G System

During the collect, a container equipped to report its status with low
latency reports to the System it needs to be emptied. As its location is
nearby the route of one of the collect vehicles, the Waste Management
and Collection System updates the work plan, informs the vehicle and
team (through the on-board unit) of the update. The team reroutes itself
in due time to consider the new container to be collected.

#### 5.3.4.4 Post-conditions

The bin or waste containers are collected only when relevant. The
collection vehicles collect only the relevant bins or containers, and
are guided towards these by the Waste Management and Collection System
with an optimised route.

The waste collection process is more efficient and this benefits to all
stakeholders.

#### 5.3.4.5 Potential Impacts or Interactions with Existing Services/Features

\[Editor\'s Note: text to be provided or \"None\" to be stated\]

#### 5.3.4.6 \[Potential\] Requirements

The 5G System shall be able to determine the position of the UEs (bin,
waste container) as well as the on-board units (waste collection
vehicles) and report these positions to an application server (e.g.
Waste Management and Collection system).

The 5G System shall be able to request the UE (bin/waste container) to
provide its location.

The 5G System shall be able to request the UE (bin/waste container) to
provide its location periodically with an update rate ranging from one
location every \[2 hours\] to one location every \[several days\].

The 5G System shall be able to provide positioning service with a
horizontal accuracy less than 3m, a vertical accuracy less than 2m, an
availability over \[99%\] and a latency lower than 1 minute. The
environment of use for the provision of the service shall be both
outdoor (main use) and indoor (including underground parking...).

The 5G system shall be able to fulfil the requirement of the positioning
service without affecting the UE's battery overall lifetime by more than
\[5\] % (e.g. 9 months out of a total of 15 years' lifetime).

### 5.3.5 Support to accurate and reliable handling of containers

#### 5.3.5.1 Description

Products are transported mainly in containers and autonomous container
management is becoming more and more frequent. Containers are stored in
varied places as ships, docks or factories. In order to take up as
little space as possible, they are stacked on several level and/or
floors.

In addition to the possibility of locating them, it is very useful to
have information the location on the container of the reference point
used for their location, to determine the attitude or bearing of bearing
of the container as well as to acces information on their size (width,
height, depth among the possible standards). This then helps their
autonomous handling and also allows a better spatial representation of
the 3D arrangement of containers on a storage site. The containers doors
must be well oriented in any case and this orientation must be known by
the handling system.

In addition, containers are often handled in challenging environments
for positioning technologies (For example, the high density of
containers in harbour or on board ships, the way they are stacked, etc.
create many obstructions for radio waves used by most positioning
technologies). It is therefore relevant to consider the use of multiple
sensors, sometime of different positioning technologies, to allow the
system to enhance positioning performances like accuracy, availability
even in complex situation.

A minimum of two sensors is needed in order to identify the direction of
the container. Two or more sensors enable measurement diversity which
can in turn improve availability and reliability of the measurements
when the containers are located in harsh conditions for wireless systems
(e.g. when they are stacked).

#### 5.3.5.2 Pre-conditions

The containers are equipped with 5G communication modules, smart lock as
well as a 5G positioning module. This positioning module can use a
combination of 3GPP technologies and non-3GPP technologies, involving
multiple sensors. For different reason, including accommodation of
physical constraints, protection against shock, and others, these
sensors are distributed in different places on the containers. A minimum
of two sensors is needed to determine the position and the heading of
the container.

The 5G System knows the position of the different sensors placed on a
container involved in the determination of both the position and the
heading.

The Factory System knows the relative position of the sensors involved
in the determination of both the position and the heading.

The Factory System knows the dimension of the container.

#### 5.3.5.3 Service Flows

Container C reaches an intermodal node by rail and needs to be stored
for a while before being transborded on a cargo ship. This handling
involves some automatic operation managed by the Factory System, using
among other inputs, the position and the heading of the container.

Multiple positioning sensors distributed on container C are activated
and enable the 5G System to collect the associated position-related
data. The 5G system combines these information to determine the position
and the orientation of the container C. The 5G system can also combine
data from different sensors and technologies in order to enhance the
overall performances of the positioning service (accuracy, availability
in harsh environments, reliability, etc.).

The 5G system provides all information concerning the container C
(positioning sensors and their reference) to the Factory System.

The Factory System, according information stored in its database (size,
relative position of the different sensors on the container) can
determine the exact 3D position to manage the container C's handling
operations.

#### 5.3.5.4 Post-conditions

Thanks to the high-quality position and heading data provided by the 5G
System, the Factory System was able to handle the container from the
wagon to its storing location, on top of three other containers, with
minimal shocks and risk of hazards.

The information provided by the 5G System relating to the different
sensors placed on the container allows the Factory System to mane them
and to determine the exact 3D position of the container.

#### 5.3.5.5 Potential Impacts or Interactions with Existing Services/Features

\[Editor\'s Note: text to be provided or \"None\" to be stated\]

#### 5.3.5.6 \[Potential\] Requirements

The 5G Sytem shall be able to determine relative positioning of one UE
versus another UE, in order to determine the heading of an object
carrying the UEs.

The 5G system can combine data from different technologies in order to
enhance the overall performances of the positioning service (accuracy,
availability in complex environments, reliability, etc.).

The 5G System shall be able to provide the relative positioning of UEs
to an application server.

The 5G system shall be able to provide this complementary information in
case of roaming.

5.4 Emergency and Mission Critical related use cases
----------------------------------------------------

### 5.4.1 Accurate positioning for emergency services

#### 5.4.1.1 Description

An emergency service enables a user to contact a Public Safety Answering
Point (PSAP) and requires the emergency services user/UE to have
accurate positioning such that they may be located and offered aid by
first responders. The level of positioning accuracy (and other KPIs)
required is dependent upon local and regional regulatory requirements.

This service offers the citizens within a jurisdiction to be located in
the time of need and requires high accuracy UE positioning in all
service areas, including those that could potentially be challenging for
some positioning technologies (e.g. urban canyons, indoors).

#### 5.4.1.2 Pre-conditions

Tom experiences or witnesses an emergency situation (e.g. fire,
accident, medical emergency).

Tom has a UE equipped with 5G communication module, as well as a 5G
positioning module. This positioning module can use a combination of
3GPP technologies and non-3GPP technologies. This includes, but not
limited to, GNSS (e.g. BeiDou, Galileo, GLONASS, and GPS), Terrestrial
Beacon Systems (TBS), sensors, WLAN, and Bluetooth-based positioning.

The 5G communication system includes an interface to a PSAP to dispatch
first responder(s).

#### 5.4.1.3 Service Flows

1\. Tom detects an emergency situation and dials/contacts the emergency
number for his region. This may initiate a call, video or messaging
service to a local PSAP.

2\. The 5G system initiates a positioning function, without user
intervention, with 3-dimentional position accuracy according to local
regulatory requirements (including minimal e.g. latency and other KPIs).

3\. Tom communicates his emergency situation with the PSAP.

4\. The PSAP dispatches first responders to Tom's location, where the
first responders are given a 3-Dimensional position and confidence for
his location.

5\. Tom completes his emergency communication with the PSAP.

#### 5.4.1.4 Post-conditions

The location information of the UE is available in the PSAP and the
first responder.

#### 5.4.1.5 Potential Impacts or Interactions with Existing Services/Features

N/A

#### 5.4.1.6 Potential Requirements

The 5G System shall be able to provide positioning service with
three-dimensional position accuracy and associated KPI targets,
determined by regulatory agencies (e.g. FCC), as follows:

\- Accuracy \[\< 50m\] horizontal (\[80%\]), \[\< 3 m\] vertical
(\[80%\])

\- Latency and TTFF \[\< 30 seconds\]

\- Availability \[\> 95%\]

\- Environment of use: indoor and outdoor

NOTE 1: The aforementioned requirements are based on FCC benchmarks to
be met around by 2020/2021. These may change in the future, as the
ultimate goal of the regulatory agencies is to get to sufficient
accuracy to determine 'which door to knock on' in an office or apartment
building.

NOTE 2: The aforementioned requirements are meant throughout the 5G
positioning service area.

NOTE 3: The vertical positioning requirement should be sufficiently
accurate to determine the floor.

The 5G System shall support the UE to provide the positioning methods
used in calculating the position and the associated
uncertainty/confidence of the position.

The 5G System shall be able to request the UE to provide location
information (e.g. measurements, position) with some periodicity as
necessary.

The 5G system shall be able to determine the reliability of the
positioning information.

### 5.4.2 Accurate Positioning for First Responders

#### 5.4.2.1 Description

Accurately locating a first responder who is injured or incapacitated
during mission critical operations has long been a goal of public
safety. A mission critical service such as MCPTT enables a first
responder to stay in contact with other first responders as well as
dispatch and command/control. Mission Critical Organizations require
mission critical services to have accurate positioning such that first
responders may be located at all times during normal and critical
operations. The level of positioning accuracy (and other KPIs) required
is much more stringent than that required by local and regional
regulatory requirements for commercial users.

This location service offers first responders to be located in emergency
situations and requires high accuracy UE positioning in all service
areas, including those that could potentially be challenging for some
positioning technologies (e.g. indoors).

#### 5.4.2.2 Pre-conditions

The ESA One Fire Department is dispatched to a report of a building fire
in an apartment complex. Three engines arrive to find thick smoke has
risen into the building from a fire on a lower floor, requiring all
floors of the apartment complex to be evacuated. Several residents are
suffering from smoke inhalation and are in need of medical treatment

The ESA One battalion chief establishes an Incident Command System and
assigns incoming firefighters to separate operational groups, including
"fire attack", "evacuation" and "medical operations". Each operational
team uses a separate MCPTT group to coordinate their actions. There are
also additional MCPTT groups to support communications between the group
leaders and the incident commander.

Each fire-fighter has a UE equipped with a 5G communication module, as
well as a 5G positioning module. In addition, the UEs of the ESA One
Fire Department are configured to initiate an Emergency Alert when a
connected man-down accessory detects an abnormal condition.

#### 5.4.2.3 Service Flows

1\. Members of the fire attack and evacuation groups enter the building
to fight the fire and coordinate the evacuation.

2\. The Incident Command System displays the location of each
fire-fighter within the building.

3\. While searching for trapped residents, fire-fighter McJanky is
overcome by heat and smoke, and collapses.

4\. McJanky\'s man-down accessory attached to his MCPTT UE detects the
abnormal condition (i.e. lack of movement, a horizontal tilt, or both)
and notifies the MCPTT UE.

5\. The MCPTT UE, in conjunction with the 5G system initiates a
positioning function, without user intervention, with 3-dimensional
position accuracy and other KPIs (e.g. minimal latency).

6\. The MCPTT UE sends an Emergency Alert with man-down indication to
the Incident Command System. The Emergency Alert contains his precise
location within the building.

7\. The Emergency Alert with precise location is also distributed to
other members of his group.

8\. The ESA One battalion chief sees the Alert and coordinates the
rescue. Other fire-fighters are able to locate McJanky quickly and they
take him out of the building to the emergency medical team. McJanky is
revived and lives to tell the story.

#### 5.4.2.4 Post-conditions

The precise location information of each fire-fighter UE continues to be
available in the Incident Command System.

#### 5.4.2.5 Potential Impacts or Interactions with Existing Services/Features

Mission Critical Services such as MCPTT, MCVideo, and MCData and MCX UEs
require access to the 5G positioning function.

#### 5.4.2.6 Potential Requirements

For outdoor location the 5G System shall provide a positioning service
with three-dimensional position accuracy and associated KPI targets
required by mission critical organizations as follows:

\- Accuracy \< \[1m\] horizontal \[95%\], \< \[0.3\] meters vertical
\[95%\]

\- Latency \< \[5\] seconds

\- TTFF \< \[10\] seconds

\- Availability \> \[98%\]

For indoor location the 5G System shall provide a positioning service
with three-dimensional position accuracy and associated KPI targets
required by mission critical organizations as follows:

\- Accuracy \< \[1m\] horizontal \[95%\], \< \[2\] meters vertical
\[95%\]

\- Latency \< \[1\] seconds

\- TTFF \< \[10\] seconds

\- Availability \> \[95%\]

NOTE: Both absolute position and relative position can be used to meet
the accuracy requirements based on operational needs.

The 5G System shall enable an MCX UE to use the positioning service to
calculate its position with the associated uncertainty/confidence of the
position.

The 5G System shall provide a mechanism to request an MCX UE to provide
location information (e.g. measurements, position) with remotely
adjustable periodicity.

The 5G System shall provide a mechanism to request that an MCX UE
provides an immediate location report.

The 5G System shall provide a mechanism to request an MCX UE to provide
an event-triggered location report. The 5G system shall be able to
determine the reliability of the positioning information

### 5.4.3 Alerting nearby emergency responders

#### 5.4.3.1 Description

In case of a medical emergency, all qualified individuals within close
vicinity of the victim get alerted via their phones with a request to
provide urgent care. The qualified individuals will often be layman
volunteers (i.e. not medical professionals) with a training in first
aid, such as applying CPR (Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation) and using an
AED (Automatic External Defibrillator) on a patient with SCA (Sudden
Cardiac Arrest). For example, in the Netherlands, a layman responder
network of 170,000 volunteers (\~1% of the general population) has been
equipped with an App to provide emergency care to provide timely
response to SCA. In this case, every second counts and help should be
provided within 6 minutes.

> NOTE: The scenario intended to cover in this use case does not exclude
> UEs supporting V2X applications. For example, in suburb or rural
> areas, a UE carrying a passenger or driver under emergency situation
> can get connected to nearby UE(s) supporting V2X applications so that
> the nearby qualified individual in that vehicle can immediately take
> necessary actions as an emergency responder using the related location
> information.

The purpose of this use case is to improve the localization of the
emergency responders closest to the victim, in order to safeguard the
quickest availability of care. The main requirements are to have a
robust solution that works both indoors and outdoors, that is scalable
to large numbers of responders and that maximizes privacy of the
(layman) responders (i.e. no continuous tracking).

#### 5.4.3.2 Pre-conditions

Paul and Sonia are layman responders trained in CPR/AED. They are
registered to the layman responder network and have installed the layman
responder App on their respective phones. Their phones are equipped with
a 5G positioning module. This positioning module can use a combination
of 3GPP technologies and non-3GPP technologies such as GNSS (e.g.
Beidou, Galileo, GLONASS and GPS), terrestrial beacons (e.g. Bluetooth,
RFID, TBS), dead-reckoning sensors, etc.

#### 5.4.3.3 Service Flows

1\. Joe, a 68 years old retired teacher is in reasonable health. One
particular day, Joe visits the mall. While walking through the mall, he
suddenly experiences chest pain and drops on the floor.

2\. Mary, sees Joe dropping, kneels by him and notices he's unconscious.
She immediately calls 911 and explains an elderly man grabbed his chest
in pain, suddenly dropped on the floor and remains unconscious.

3\. Andy, the 911 call center agent taking Mary's call, suspects SCA and
initiates the layman responder network.

4\. Mary's location -- as determined by her phone (see use case 5.4.1
"Accurate positioning for emergency services") -- is automatically
forwarded to the layman responder network, which notices two qualified
layman first responders in Mary's (Joe's) immediate vicinity, Paul and
Sonia. Also, an ambulance from the nearby hospital is directed to the
scene.

5\. Paul, who's just one floor away from Joe gets an instant
notification on his phone from the layman responder App, indicating that
a possible cardiac arrest victim is in need of his help. He confirms his
willingness to help, by clicking "Accept Call" in the App and is guided
towards Joe by his phone.

6\. Sonia, who's on the other side of the mall, but in close vicinity of
an AED, also gets and instant notification on her phone and also she
confirms. After this she is directed towards the nearest AED (see use
case 5.4.3 "Emergency equipment location outside hospitals"). She then
picks up the AED and heads for Joe.

7\. Paul arrives first on the scene, notices that Joe has no pulse and
starts administering CPR.

8\. Sonia arrives a little bit later with the AED and together they
apply the AED.

9\. Joe's heart starts beating again and ten minutes later the ambulance
arrives to take Joe to the hospital.

#### 5.4.3.4 Post-conditions

Joe lives, because the nearest by layman responders get notified
instantly.

#### 5.4.3.5 Potential Impacts or Interactions with Existing Services/Features

What's called for is a location-aware group messaging service, that is
scalable to very large groups of responders nationwide and that avoids
continuous tracking of individuals. This will require an interplay of
various network features and elements, specifically also because the
service needs to work across different operator networks. Also the
division of functionality between the network and the application
remains to be determined.

#### 5.4.3.6 \[Potential\] Requirements

The 5G system (in conjunction with the layman responder network) shall
be enabled to alert the group of \[\~ 10\] potential responders with
shortest travel time to the victim, scanned from a radius of \[5 km\]
from the victim. This requires localization of each responder with a
horizontal resolution of less than \[50 m\] and, indoors, a vertical
resolution sufficiently accurate to determine the floor, so typically
less than \[3 m\]. This localization accuracy needs to be achieved
throughout the 5G positioning service area.

The 5G system shall not perform continuous tracking of each layman
responder to respect his/her privacy.

The 5G system shall be scalable to address the positioning of at least
\[5%\] of all subscribers being registered to the layman responder
service.

The 5G system shall work across boundaries of individual operator
networks in the region.

### 5.4.4 Emergency equipment location outside hospitals

#### 5.4.4.1 Description

Life-saving medical equipment, such as AED's, deployed throughout public
and private spaces can be localized instantly in case of need, to be
able to take the equipment within the minimum possible amount of time to
an emergency scene. This use case is about knowing for sure where the
equipment actually is, rather than where it is supposed to be, and
making sure it does not get lost, i.e. it is about maintaining an
up-to-date location database of all equipment deployed throughout a
region or a nation.

This use case is related to use case 5.4.2 "Alerting nearby emergency
responders".

#### 5.4.4.2 Pre-conditions

The equipment (AED) is connected to the 5G network for maintenance
purposes (e.g. checking battery-level) and also provided with a 5G
positioning module. This positioning module can use a combination of
3GPP technologies and non-3GPP technologies such as GNSS (e.g. Beidou,
Galileo, GLONASS and GPS) and terrestrial beacons (e.g. Bluetooth, RFID,
TBS).

The equipment uses the 5G positioning module to provide regular updates
of its actual location to the AED positioning system (e.g. at least each
time motion is detected an update should be provided). The AED
positioning system maintains a location database of all AED's deployed
throughout a region or a nation. The layman responder app/system (as
mentioned in Section 5.4.2) has access to the AED positioning system.

The equipment can be located either indoor or outdoor.

#### 5.4.4.3 Service Flows

1\. Sonia, a lady who is subscribed to the layman responder network, has
received and accepted a call for help to resuscitate Joe, an elderly man
experiencing Sudden Cardiac Arrest.

2\. The layman responder network app (or system) interrogates the AED
positioning system which maintains an up-to-date location database of
AED's, and determines the closest AED on the way between Sonia's current
location (as determined by her 5G phone) and the location of the victim
in need for help and informs the layman responder App on Sonia's 5G
phone of this location.

3\. Sonia's 5G phone computes the quickest way to the AED.

4\. Sonia follows the instructions on her 5G phone and picks up the AED.

5\. After picking up the AED, the AED wakes up from its sleep mode,
connect to the network. The AED positioning module is activated and
position updates are provided the AED positioning system.

6\. Sonia heads for Joe following instructions on here phone and applies
the AED on Joe.

7\. After usage, the AED positioning system receives several updates to
the AED's position before it is put back on its original place.

8\. Once put back, the AED enters sleep mode for an extended period of
time, and wakes up only once per week/month to connect to the network.

#### 5.4.4.4 Post-conditions

Joe lives, because an accurate record can be maintained with the
location of critical equipment (AED).

#### 5.4.4.5 \[Potential\] Requirements

The 5G System shall be able to provide positioning service with a
horizontal accuracy less than \[10 m\] and, indoors, with a vertical
accuracy sufficiently accurate to determine the floor, so typically less
than \[3 m\]. This localization accuracy needs to be achieved throughout
the 5G positioning service area.

The 5G System shall allow UEs to sleep for extended periods of time
(e.g. one week), without requiring the UE to update its position data.

The 5G system shall allow UEs to trigger a different update rate of the
position data based on whether the UE is moving or not.

5.5 Road-related use cases
--------------------------

### 5.5.1 Accurate positioning to support Traffic Monitoring, Management and Control 

#### 5.5.1.1 Description

This use case describes the traffic monitoring, management and control
services supervised by a regional/local authority that has the objective
to optimise traffic flow when needed and provide feedback to road users
to make traffic more fluent.

NOTE: This use case is not intended to utilize the 3GPP sidelink
interface. Possible ways of collecting location fixes of vehicles of
interest and notifying lane-management information/instruction are based
on Uu-interface.

Decision relating to traffic monitoring and control, congestion and
access to some areas for some vehicle (parking, access to city centre)
are becoming more complex due to more intensive use of lane management
techniques in the future by highway operators. Currently the traffic
monitoring relies primarily on video surveillance, Priorities and rules
applications to roads and lanes are mostly static, or may be, in some
cases, updated in real time with information panels on gantries.

As traffic increase, lane choices and priorities become more complex
(more diversity in vehicles types and regulations, vehicle automation
levels increase, time-varying priorities for different type of vehicles,
incentive to use low energy vehicles or car-sharing), some level of
decision support assistance will be required. This use cases address a
more dynamic implementation, complementing video surveillance monitoring
with positioning-related data determined involving the 5G system.

The Traffic Management Server (TMS) will monitor the traffic in real
time, processing information reported messages transmitted by vehicles
and video surveillance installed at key points along roads. Depending on
the traffic situation, planned public work, need for emergency route,
etc. the Traffic Management Server (TMS) will send message to vehicles
via the 5G network to give them guidance and updates. For instance, some
of the vehicles might be requested to maintain the lane they are on
others might be asked to change to other lane due to various reasons
(crowded lane, vehicle class not allowed on the current lane etc.).
Traffic management will monitor vehicles at the level of lane, this and
therefore need to reference any positioning information to the map of
the infrastructure (roads, lanes) and manage the vehicles' positioning
information over multiple road segments and long distance. It is also
necessary to be able to distinguish superposed road segments and lanes
(typically bridges, large highway crossings, etc.). This use case
therefore needs both horizontal and vertical absolute positioning. 3GPP
TS 22.186 v15.2.0 defines relative positioning requirements, primarily
for platooning. In the case where relative positioning information is
transposed into absolute 3D positioning information using LTE
positioning technologies, the resulting accuracy would not be sufficient
for the proposed use case.

To satisfy the use cases, the vehicle position needs to be determined
with an accuracy able to identify the lane the vehicle is using.

The TMS collects data received (user location, crash alert, driving
speed, etc.) from the road traffic participants in the areas it is
covering, provides traffic guidance to road users and modifies rules and
priorities applicable to the different lanes. The TMS uses the
position-related data to check that the drivers are indeed applying the
new rules and priorities. The positioning-related data provided to the
TMS by the UE and/or the System (e.g. vehicle location, speed, heading,
etc.) need to be trustworthy and/or allow the TMS to investigate and
check their trustworthiness. For instance, Users (and third parties)
should not be able to fraud the TMS' control by tampering the
positioning-related data, for example, to drive on a newly unauthorised
lane.

#### 5.5.1.2 Pre-conditions

The vehicle is equipped with a 5G communication module and a 5G
positioning module. These modules can be integrated in the smartphone of
the vehicle's user. The positioning module provides vehicle position,
velocity and time information. This positioning module can use a
combination of 3GPP technologies and non-3GPP technologies. This
includes, but not limited to, GNSS (e.g. BeiDou, Galileo, GLONASS and
GPS), Terrestrial Beacon Systems (TBS), Bluetooth, WLAN, RFID, and
sensors, eventually complemented with data to enhance these
technologies.

A regional TMS exists and is connected to a 5G Network. The TMS is used
by relevant local authorities and overlooks only regional/local
geographic areas and has the role of ensuring proper lane management
according to the changing traffic conditions.

Environments: outdoors and indoors (tunnels), within 5G positioning
service area.

#### 5.5.1.3 Service Flows

The 5G positioning module enables the 3GPP system to determine its
current location at a high rate. The frequency of the location reporting
may change according to the application requirements.

The 5G positioning module reports location information, velocity and
heading to other vehicles and infrastructure (Road Side Unit). At any
time, the 5G positioning module shall be able to report its location
information. The TMS has access to velocity information with a certain
accuracy e.g. less than \[1\] m/s.

The Server advises for changing lanes, checks if user is allowed to be
in a lane, recommends staying in the lane, etc.

#### 5.5.1.4 Post-conditions

The vehicle's users benefit from optimized flow management, up to date
information on the traffic, and will always drive on the correct lane.

TMS collects and aggregates traffic info at lane level and allows road
operator to optimise road management (lane) to avoid congestions and
improve the traffic flow. However, at no point the TMS would know from
which vehicle (or user) this information came from and will not disclose
to 3rd parties any position -- related data provided by road users.

#### 5.5.1.5 Potential Impacts or Interactions with Existing Services/Features

#### 5.5.1.6 Potential Requirements

The 5G System shall be able to provide positioning service with a
horizontal accuracy of \[1\] m across-track and \[3\] m along-track for
UE speed up to the maximum speed authorized on highways (e.g.
\[130-160\] km/h).

NOTE: The use case is intended to support applications that performs
tasks of monitoring and reporting the effective traffic's density at
lane level, but it does not involve Safety-of-Life or critical
operations (such as those in autonomous vehicles). To identify the lane
a vehicle (of variable width: car, truck or motorbike) is using, the
positioning service should have an accuracy better than half the lane's
width, accounting for some margin and the uncertainty on the width of
the vehicle and the place where the position sensor is on the vehicle.
The lane width is typically in the range of 3 -- 4 m and the margin does
not need to be tight (because it is not a critical application),
therefore, a target accuracy of 1m seems reasonable to detect lane.

The 5G System shall be able to provide positioning service with a
vertical accuracy of \[2.5\] m for speed up to the maximum speed
authorized on highways (e.g. \[130-160\] km/h).

NOTE: Vertical separation of superposed roads may be as low as 5 meters.
The position sensors may be distributed in various places of the
vehicles, including on the upper part of the vehicle or on the roof,
hence more than one meter above the road level. This may vary
significantly from one type of vehicle to the other. To allow the system
to distinguish between two vehicles moving on superposed road, each with
position sensors in different places, a vertical accuracy in the range
2.5m seems a reasonable target.

The 5G System shall be able to provide positioning service with an
availability of \[95\] %.

The 5G System shall be able to provide positioning service with a TTFF
less than \[10\] s.

The 5G System shall be able to provide positioning service with an
update rate of \[10\] Hz.

The 5G System shall be able to provide positioning service with a
latency of less than \[30\] ms.

The 5G System shall be able to ensure the positioning-related data are
secured.

The 5G System shall support mechanisms to protect positioning-related
data against tampering and spoofing.

The 5G System shall support mechanisms to detect tampering attempts on
the position-related data and spoofing.

The 5G System shall be able to support the protection of the UE's
privacy.

### 5.5.2 Road-User Charging (RUC)

#### 5.5.2.1 Description

Road-User Charging (RUC) defines generic services monitoring a vehicles
position (and/or motion) with the aim of levying a charge or a tax on
the vehicle's user, based on the way the road infrastructure is used by
the user. It may apply to any kind of road (local and national network,
motorways and can be expanded to access control to urban areas or
parking) and may target all kinds of vehicle, primarily:

\- Personal vehicles, for applications such as Pay-as-you-drive (PyD)
such as insurance and car as a service, management of traffic congestion
and incentive for certain vehicle energy or car-sharing (dissuade use of
low occupancy vehicles on high occupancy lanes, etc.)

\- Professional vehicles, for applications such as road tolling (based
on distance, time, type of vehicle and freight, period of day or week,
availability of alternative multimodal transports schemes, etc.)

Originally, RUC services relied on static, rigid implementations, either
access control to road (tolling booth) or annual fees (insurances) and
taxes per vehicles. The development of LBS technologies allows the
implementation of dynamic and highly flexible RUC services: an On-board
Unit (OBU) enables the determination of the vehicle's position and
motion (e.g. velocity or velocity profile) and reports this information
to the RUC system (for instance, a regional or national processing
facility). The latter applies RUC algorithms to establish the fee to be
charged. The RUC algorithms may be adapted to evolving needs and
applications, expand the coverage in terms of the charged road and
conditions without the need to deploy new infrastructure like tollbooth,
gantries, etc. The RUC algorithms may also apply different charging
strategies according to traffic condition (congestion, period of day),
lane occupancy or priorities (priority vehicle, incentive for car
sharing, management of specific freight or hazardous materials, etc.),
velocity profile. Consequently, the position-related data should be
accurate enough to determine the position of the vehicle at lane level
and to determine the vehicle's velocity with good accuracy.

The positioning-related data provided to the RUC Application Server need
to be fully trustworthy: reliability, integrity, high confidence level
and protection against tampering are key aspects for any RUC service.
Users (and third parties) should not be able to fraud the RUC
Application Server by tampering the positioning-related data in order to
avoid application of the charges.

#### 5.5.2.2 Pre-conditions

The user or the user's vehicle is equipped with a RUC OBU, comprising a
5G communication module and a 5G positioning module. This positioning
module can use a combination of 3GPP technologies and non-3GPP
technologies. This includes, but not limited to, GNSS (e.g. BeiDou,
Galileo, GLONASS and GPS), Terrestrial Beacon Systems (TBS), Bluetooth,
WLAN, RFID, and sensors, to allow the RUC system to determine vehicle
position-related data.

The RUC Application Server is connected to a 5G Network, and it includes
algorithms to compute the charges, monitors the traffic and manage fraud
detection algorithms.

The environment of use is primarily outdoor, including urban areas and
rural areas (wide coverage area), but includes also road tunnels and
parking areas, which may obstruct positioning signals.

#### 5.5.2.3 Service Flows

The 5G positioning module enables the 3GPP system to determine position,
velocity (or velocity profile). The frequency of the determination may
vary according to the RUC application requirements. Indeed, depending on
the application, determination of the position-related data needs to be
achieved in close-to-real-time or not. Insurance and PyD applications
may handle charging on a regular, for instance on a monthly or yearly
basis.

This information is reported to the RUC Application Server in addition
with information relating to the user (including type of vehicle and
transported passenger or freight).

For what regards road user charging, one can distinguish two main types
of applications. The first one deals with levying a fixed tax depending
on the road that is taken by the vehicle. In this case, the position
information shall be available each time with a periodicity of 1s but
the information can be reported to the central application server by
packets in non-real time. The second type of application deals with a
dynamic fees level in order to control dynamically the traffic. In this
case, real time reporting shall be insured.

For PyD insurance applications, the position data information shall be
available each second in order to compute distances. Report shall be
sent periodically to the central server.

In all cases, Integrity of the information shall be insured all along
the information chain

#### 5.5.2.4 Post-conditions

The user is charged according to its use of the road infrastructure or
according to the use of the vehicle and driving behaviour.

The operator of the road infrastructure has access to additional
information to plan his operations (evolution and capacity increase,
maintenance, etc.).

The processing (determinist or statistical analysis) of the reported
information brings additional benefits to the road user community,
enabling by-products for the operators of road infrastructure, like for
instance:

\- Traffic flow statistics and management (including real time traffic
management, establishment of priority lanes according to period of day,
etc.)

\- Feedback of road usage, to plan for road evolution (increase of
capacity, bypass route) or maintenance (for instance, in case of more
heavy traffic on some roads or lane)

\- More secure traffic for all road users.

#### 5.5.2.5 Potential Impacts or Interactions with Existing Services/Features

\[Editor\'s Note: text to be provided or \"None\" to be stated\]

#### 5.5.2.6 Potential Requirements

The 5G System shall be able to provide positioning service with a
horizontal accuracy in the range \[1 -- 3\] m, an update rate of \[1\]
Hz and an availability of \[99\] % for speed up to \[130 km/h\].

The 5G System shall be able to provide velocity information with an
accuracy of \[2\] m/s, an update rate of \[1\] Hz and an availability of
\[99\] % for speed up to \[130 km/h\].

The 5G System shall be able to provide positioning service with a TTFF
less than \[10\] s.

The 5G System shall be able to provide positioning service with a user
density up to at least \[1000 per km²\].

The 5G System shall support mechanisms to protect positioning-related
data against tampering and spoofing.

The 5G System shall support mechanisms to detect tampering and spoofing
attempts on the position-related data.

5.6 Rail and Maritime related use cases
---------------------------------------

### 5.6.1 Asset and freight tracking (wagon, container)

#### 5.6.1.1 Description

Asset tracking is becoming a key capability for worldwide logistics like
in the railway or maritime freight sector (containers, tanks and
wagons):

\- For providers and customers: it provides means to optimise the
overall transportation efficiency, and improves end-to-end traceability.
Freight tracking enables more accurate scheduling of all involved
operations (departure and arrival time, delays, organisation of
transhipment, etc.).

\- For freight operators, it eases lean asset management (maintenance
and retrofit of assets, reduced risks relating to lost or stolen cargos,
containers and wagons)

\- Freight tracking helps securing the transportation of hazardous
materials and goods, and supports efficient operations in relation with
regulation, for instance at customs (procedures may adapt to freight,
transit route, countries through which the container / wagon travelled,
etc.).

The asset tracker should fulfil very long lifetime (up to 15 years),
with very low maintenance and power autonomy enabled by batteries
sustaining the whole lifetime or with energy harvesting (solar panel,
mechanical energy harvesting during transportation) or with both.

The position-related data need to be secured and protected against
tampering to dissuade from any unauthorized use, fraud or theft of the
transported goods.

The use case can be expanded to other verticals, as it is the case in
clause 5.43 of 3GPP TR 22.891 v14.2.0 (Feasibility Study on New Services
and Markets Technology Enablers).

#### 5.6.1.2 Pre-conditions

The UE (asset tracker installed on a container, tank, and wagon) is
equipped with a 5G communication module and a 5G positioning module. It
is self-powered using energy harvesting or long-lifetime battery, and
connects to sensors reporting relevant information about the asset
(temperature, pressure, shock and motion detection, etc.). When
installed on the asset, the UE is properly initialised, with secure
parameters and trusted initial conditions.

The service areas are categorized as follow:

\- Transportation areas: outdoor, covering very wide areas (regional and
continental level) including mountainous areas, canopy and tunnels. The
transportation areas can include areas with no terrestrial coverage
(e.g. a container on a ship at sea).

\- Storage areas: enhanced positioning areas (up to 10 km²), with
storage both indoor and outdoor (warehouse, railway stations, harbours,
etc.) and a very high density of users (above 100 000 per km²).

The Asset Management System (AMS), connected to a 5G Network, collects
and processes the information reported by all device trackers relating
to a given customer.

#### 5.6.1.3 Service Flows

Container C, equipped with an asset tracker (UE), is planned to deliver
a cargo from storage area A to C, using a train that will transit via B.
If A, B and C have different applicable regulations for the transported
freight, specific control will apply upon arrival in C. Before departure
from A, the UE is initialised securely (initial position, planned route,
etc.)

From A to C (transportation service area), the UE enables the 3GPP
system to determine its current position (and velocity), and reports
relevant parameters related to the asset or freight container (collected
parameters like freight temperature, pressure, detection of shock). The
determination of position (and velocity) is performed on a regular
basis, but not continuously, and does not need to be reported in
real-time to the AMS. Position-related data should allow to coarsely
identify where the freight is, whether it is moving and in which
direction.

Meanwhile, Container C's position-related data and parameters are
collected and used by the AMS at least to:

\- monitor the transfer and delivery by Container C, and update
stakeholders on schedule and delivery time, and eventually, raise alert
in case of delivery delays, rerouting (different route than the one
initially planned), etc.

\- support End-to-End traceability, efficient procedure at customs
(transit via B) and facilitate the control of the compliancy to
regulation.

Upon arrival in the storage area C, and until customer takes delivery of
the container's content, the UE's position is determined in 3D and used
to identify container C. High accuracy is needed to distinguish
containers on stacks. During handling, position-related data are
determined continuously, also with very high accuracy. After handling,
during storage, the UE switches to idle mode, monitors motion to detect
unauthorised handling or move, and wakes up regularly (e.g. daily basis)
to enable position check.

The position of the asset tracker must be determined all along its
travel into the transportation area to ensure continuity of the
traceability information. This includes areas with no terrestrial
coverage. Therefore, when the UE is outside coverage of 3GPP
RAT-dependent positioning technologies:

\- The UE enables non-3GPP positioning technologies to determine its
position (e.g. using a GNSS receiver). In the case that the UE
determines its position (e.g. using a GNSS receiver), it shall log the
position-related data into its memory.

\- The 5G system is able to access to the log of the position determined
outside the coverage of 3GPP RAT-dependent positioning technologies.

#### 5.6.1.4 Post-conditions

Container C was delivered in due time, with minimal latency and time
overheads. It followed a safe route, duly reported and traced in the
AMS. The customer had continuously access to the full traceability of
the delivery and is in turn able to provide evidence of traceability to
subsequent customer.

Thanks to the logged information, the freight operator may demonstrate
the compliancy to regulation with minimum effort, and use the
information collected by the AMS to improve the efficiency of his
deliveries.

#### 5.6.1.5 Potential Impacts or Interactions with Existing Services/Features

\[Editor\'s Note: text to be provided or \"None\" to be stated\]

#### 5.6.1.6 Potential Requirements

The 5G system shall be able to provide positioning service for the
static UE in an enhanced positioning area, indoor or outdoor with the
following potential requirements:

\- Absolute position accuracy: \[1\] m (horizontal and vertical), \[99\]
% availability, an update rate up to \[1\] Hz and a latency less than
\[1\] s.

\- TTFF less than \[10\] s.

The 5G system shall be able to provide positioning service for UE moving
at speed up to 180 km/h outdoor, over very wide coverage with the
following potential requirements:

\- Absolute position accuracy: \[10-30\] m horizontal position accuracy,
\[99\] % availability

\- Velocity accuracy: \[5\] m/s horizontal velocity accuracy, \[99\] %
availability

\- Position and velocity update rate: the time interval between 2
successive position fix can vary between \[300 s\] and \[24 hours\].

The UE shall support mechanisms to determine its position using non-3GPP
positioning technologies when outside the coverage of 3GPP RAT-dependent
positioning technologies.

The 5G system shall support mechanisms to access the UE's
position-related data determined when the UE is outside the coverage of
3GPP RAT-dependent positioning technologies.

The 5G System shall be able to provide a positioning service involving
an average of less than \[20 mJ\] of the UE's energy per position fix.

NOTE: the value of the energy per fix is an averaged figure, determined
over a time interval larger than the position update period (for
example, 1 hour, 24 hours, 1 week, etc.). This requirement does not
presume the positioning method, which can be in the UE or in the core
Network.

The 5G System shall support mechanisms to protect positioning-related
data against tampering and spoofing.

The 5G System shall support mechanisms to detect tampering and spoofing
attempts on the position-related data.

5.7 Aerial-related use cases
----------------------------

### 5.7.1 Accurate positioning to support Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) missions and operations

#### 5.7.1.1 Description

Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) or drones for professional or leisure
applications are used for several missions. During their mission, they
might be connected to a remote user or a Mission Application Server to
report regularly or by burst mission information that are processed to
generated added value products. The Mission information that is reported
is often images of the environment that is flown over. The images can be
optical or another type of sensor, such as an infrared sensor. The
images are in general tagged with Meta Data describing the mission.

In such a context, the images often need to be geo-localised with a high
accuracy in order to allow recombining the images as a sequence of image
representing a given scene compared or superimposed onto a ground
digital map. This allows generating benefit information from the
recombined images mapped on a given existing reference.

In other situations, several flights are performed over the same area,
and the mission of the drone's sensor is to provide information to
evaluate particular environmental evolutions at various dates. For
automatic processing of the flow of images, the images and therefore the
UAV shall be accurately geo-localised with absolute positions
information.

In addition, during the landing phase, the UAV operations need also
precise 3D geo-localisation information in order to allow automatic
landing

#### 5.7.1.2 Pre-conditions

The user's drone is equipped with a Navigation Unit, comprising a UE
with a 5G communication module and a 5G positioning module. This
positioning module can use a combination of 3GPP technologies and
non-3GPP technologies. This includes, but not limited to, GNSS (e.g.
BeiDou, Galileo, GLONASS and GPS), Terrestrial Beacon Systems,
Bluetooth, WLAN, RFID, and sensors, to allow the Navigation Unit system
to determine UAV position-related data.

The UAV Mission Application Centre is connected to a 5G Network. The
Centre includes algorithms to process the images and generate added
value information from a series of images in sequences or at various
dates.

The environment of use is primarily outdoor, including urban areas and
rural areas (wide coverage area).

#### 5.7.1.3 Service Flows

The 5G positioning module enables the 3GPP system to determine position,
velocity (or velocity profile) and date. The frequency of the
determination shall be regular typically every second.

The need for reporting the information can vary depending on the
applications. In some implementations, the UAV system may use the
information directly, and thereof, this information is not reported as
such to the Mission Application Centre.

In some cases, the information shall be reported in quasi real time in
order to allow a remote control of the mission.

In case where the position-related data is used in the processing and
analysis of the images collected by the UAV, the Mission Application
Centre processes the images reported by the UAV, either in real time or
in post processing when the UAV has landed and uploaded its images bank
to the server. Very low latency is not mandatory.

In the case where the Navigation Unit information is used for landing
operations, the position information are reported to the on-board flight
computer to control the flight in order to ensure a smooth landing.
Latency need to be commensurate to the velocity of the UAV in the
landing phase to maintain the relevancy of the accuracy requirements.

#### 5.7.1.4 Post-conditions

The images are georeferenced using the position-related data provided by
the UAV Navigation Unit, as part of Meta Data describing each image.
Based on this Meta Data, the Mission Application Centre can recombine
precisely a sequence of images to generate a scene precisely located in
space. The Centre can also compare the environment situations by
processing various images taken at various dates, with a common position
reference, or by comparing the images with any other sources of
geo-localised information.

#### 5.7.1.5 Potential Impacts or Interactions with Existing Services/Features

#### 5.7.1.6 Potential Requirements

The 5G system shall be able to provide positioning service to support
drones applications with \[10\] cm horizontal and vertical position
accuracy, 99% availability, for UE moving at \[150\] km/h outdoor.

The 5G system shall be able to provide positioning service to support
applications with under \[50\] cm/s horizontal and vertical velocity
accuracy and \[2\]º bearing accuracy, over 99% availability, for UE
moving at speed up to \[150\] km/h outdoor.

The 5G System shall be able to provide positioning service to support
applications with a TTFF less than \[10\] s.

The 5G system shall be able to provide positioning service such that the
UE\'s power consumption will be less than \[200\] mW in the worst case.

The 5G System shall support mechanisms to protect positioning-related
data against tampering.

The 5G System shall support mechanisms to detect tampering attempts on
the position-related data.

The 5G System shall be able to ensure the positioning related data are
secured, and shall allow the protection of the user's privacy.

### 5.7.2 Transport and inspection by drones for medical purposes

#### 5.7.2.1 Description

Medication and cures need to be transported between two different
buildings (for instance, pharmacy to a dedicated unit) inside a hospital
made up of several buildings on several hectares with large green areas
or between two different hospitals (in the same city). Drones can be
used for these transportations.

Some hospitals may organise and pool their stock of medication and
production of cures.

Some hospitals, part of a same group or not, may exchange medication,
for instance, in case one face empty stock, or is not equipped to store
some cures (e.g. chemotherapy).

In all these cases and situations, medication and cures need to be
transported between two distinct locations, in a trusted, secure and
time-controlled process. The locations may be distant from several tens
of kilometres. Drones can be used to ensure such transportation.

In addition to transport between buildings, drones can be used to
transport life-saving equipment (e.g. AED) from a predetermined location
to an arbitrary outdoor (or even indoor) location in close vicinity of a
patient (e.g. suffering of Sudden Cardiac Arrest). Also a drone (could
be the same drone delivering the life-saving equipment) needs to hover
over the scene and provide a live video feed to an emergency call
centre, enabling better life saving support.

The drone flies at low altitude. The drone needs to maintain a
continuous connection with the mobile network, which requires the
network supports continuous wireless coverage in low altitude flight
scenarios.

During the whole delivery process, the position and the status of the
drone needs to monitored and logged in order to ensure the full
traceability of the delivery, as well as the security of the delivery.

A drone and remote control are connected to the mobile network. A
continuous connection with the mobile network is needed, especially in
the case of transport between two hospitals requiring a way in the
public domain.

The drone is piloted with remote mode, the data being transmitted via
the network

Position accuracy is defined to minimise risk of damage to property or
life in densely populated areas.

Extreme Real-Time Communications are addressed in the NGMN 5G white
paper \[5\].

#### 5.7.2.2 Pre-conditions

The drone and its payload container are equipped with 5G communication
modules, smart lock as well as a 5G positioning module. This positioning
module can use a combination of 3GPP technologies and non-3GPP
technologies.

A drone and remote control are connected to the mobile network.

The drone is piloted with remote mode, the data being transmitted via
the network.

#### 5.7.2.3 Service Flows

Tom needs to receive a cure in emergency in Hospital A, the one close to
the place he lives. The cure must be delivered within the next 24 hours,
but is not available in Hospital A. The doctors consider Tom's health
does not allow transporting him to another Hospital. Fortunately,
Hospital A is organised with other Hospitals in the region to manage
such circumstances: it was agreed in the past that the stock of this
cure would be centralised in Hospital B and the cure distributed when
needed using drones.

Hospital A's Pharmacist requests the delivery of the cure using the
Hospital specific drone system. The trajectory and details of the
delivery (including a unique identifier linking the delivery operation,
ID of the patient, ID of Hospital A and B, ID of the cure, etc.) are
defined in the delivery management application and loaded in the drone
and its payload container. The container can only be opened upon arrival
in duly identified and authorized locations (Hospital A and Hospital B),
and if handled by authorized personnel.

The drone leaves Hospital A and reaches Hospital B less than one hour
later. Meanwhile, Hospital B's Pharmacy prepared the cure, put it in an
adequate and secured container ready for transportation.

Upon arrival of the drone, after reporting its arrival, Hospital B's
Pharmacist unlocks the drone and its container using his ID, introduces
the cure into the drone's payload container and locks it again with his
ID.

The drone flies back to Hospital A, where upon arrival, the Pharmacist
of Hospital A proceeds with similar actions as above to retrieve the
cure from the container.

The cure has reached the Pharmacy of Hospital A, and can now be handled
as if it came out of the stock of Hospital A.

During the whole operation, all relevant information about the drone's
trajectory, the status and content of the container are logged. In
addition, the drone's positioning module enabled the determination of
its position in a secure way, resilient to spoofing and tampering
attempt, this to prevent errors in the delivery, misuse and attempt to
smuggle the cure.

#### 5.7.2.4 Post-conditions

Tom receives the cure in due time. The handling of the delivery is more
efficient than the former system used by Hospital A and B, which relied
on ambulances or taxi delivery, particularly expensive in case of
emergency and in night shifts.

All information about the operation are authenticated, exchanged and
logged with adequate security for traceability

#### 5.7.2.5 \[Potential\] Requirements

The 5G system shall support:

\- Round trip latency less than \[150 ms\], including all network
components.

\- Due to the consequences of failure being loss of property or life,
reliability goal is \[near 100%.\]

\- Reliability to be at the same level for current aviation Air Traffic
Control (ATC). Link supports command and control of vehicles in
controlled airspace. The integrity of the position needs to be ensured
in compliance with the regulations.

\- Priority, Precedence, Preemption (PPP) mechanisms shall be used to
ensure sufficient reliability metrics are reached.

\- Position is to be authenticated, and logged in the system for
security and traceability.

For en-route phases and hovering over an emergency scene, the 5G system
shall be able to provide positioning service with \[50 cm\] horizontal
position accuracy and a \[30 cm\] vertical accuracy, 99% availability,
for the moving UE at the speed of up to \[50km/hour\]. The accuracy
needs to be met throughout the 5G positioning service area. The
environment of use for en-route phase is outdoor, mainly unobstructed.

During docking phases (take-off and landing), the 5G system shall be
able to provide positioning service with \[50 cm\] horizontal position
accuracy and a \[10 cm\] vertical accuracy, 99.9% availability for quasi
stationery UE in enhanced positioning area of \[10m2\]. The environment
of use for the docking-phase is outdoor, but may suffer obstruction from
buildings in the vicinity of the drone's docking stations.

The 5G System shall support mechanisms to protect positioning-related
data against tampering.

The 5G System shall support mechanisms to detect tampering attempts on
the position-related data.

5.8 Other use cases

agreement between operator's policy and 3rd party

### 5.8.2 Support location method negotiation

#### 5.8.2.1 Description

One location module in a UE may support multiple methods to supply its
position information, for example, 3GPP technologies and non-3GPP
technologies. This includes, but not limited to, GNSS (e.g. BeiDou,
Galileo, GLONASS, and GPS), Terrestrial Beacon Systems (TBS), Bluetooth,
WLAN, RFID, and sensors. Different location methods support different
level position performance and capabilities. So, it is suggested to
support negotiation of location capabilities considering user,
application, or network operator's demands.

#### 5.8.2.2 Pre-conditions

Bob is user of operator A. Bob's UE supports multiple mode location
methods, for example, 3GPP technologies and non-3GPP technologies. This
includes, but not limited to, GNSS (e.g. BeiDou, Galileo, GLONASS and
GPS), Terrestrial Beacon Systems (TBS), Bluetooth, WLAN, RFID, and
sensors.

The 3GPP system of Operator A supports multiple location methods, for
example, 3GPP technologies and non-3GPP technologies. This includes, but
not limited to, GNSS (e.g. BeiDou, Galileo, GLONASS and GPS),
Terrestrial Beacon Systems (TBS), Bluetooth, WLAN, RFID,, and sensors.
Bob has registered the location service from operator A.

#### 5.8.2.3 Service Flows

Bob is going to drive to his office. When he leaves his home, he
switches on the GNSS e.g. BeiDou location enable button in his UE and
open the Map application.

Bob's UE notifies the 3GPP system that it can support LTEand BeiDou
location methods now, and requests that which ones the system use to
supply location service.

The 3GPP system identifies that Bob's UE is in outdoor and the
navigation application is active, so responses that the LTE, 5G and
BeiDou location methods can be used.

Bob's UE receives the response and begins to supply position data to the
3GPP system periodically. During Bob is driving to his office, the 3GPP
system provides navigation location service to him.

Bob arrives his office basement and plans to park his electric car to
the wireless charging port which requires higher accuracy positioning
capability. The parking application sends positioning requirement to
3GPP system to request higher accuracy positioning requirement.

Then, the 3GPP system analyses that this higher accuracy positioning
requirement can be supported by 5G and asks Bob's UE that whether the 5G
location method can be used now. Bob's UE responses that WLAN, LTE, 5G
location methods can be used.

The 3GPP system decides to use 5G which can support higher accuracy
location performance to support parking application positioning
requirement.

The 3GPP system notifies Bob's UE of the selected location method and
parking application that its positioning request can be supported.

The 3GPP system and Bob's UE switch location method to 5G location
methods. The location service continues and helps to park Bob's car.

#### 5.8.2.4 Post-conditions

Bob is provided with different location services in different scenarios.

#### 5.8.2.5 Potential Impacts or Interactions with Existing Services/Features

None identified.

location methods to supply location service according to operator's
policy or application's requirements or user's preference.

6 Synthesis of the use cases performances targets
=================================================

6.1 Foreword
------------

Adaptability and flexibility are among the key features of the 5G system
to satisfy a diversity of services to many different verticals,
representing different classes of performances and environment of use.
This applies also to 5G positioning services, which can be supported by
either 3GPP positioning technologies or a combination of 3GPP and
non-3GPP positioning technologies to optimise the performances provided
to the different users.

The following table summarises the potential performances requirements
of the positioning use cases organised per vertical in Clause 5. Doing
so, it also features a comprehensive illustration of the diversity of
positioning services the 5G system aims to support.

</table>

Nonetheless, in spite of their diversity, those potential requirements
cannot be considered as fully independent from one use case to the
other. The considerations developed in the present clause complement the
use cases descriptions with transversal analysis. In perspective of the
requirements consolidation, they highlight potential similarities among
use cases, beyond the verticals boundaries, and lead to further grouping
of the uses cases.

6.2 Considerations on the commonalities of performances targets among use cases
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 6.2.1 Time to first fix (TTFF)

Many of the reported use cases target a TTFF less than 10 seconds. The
"Emergency call" use case requires a TTFF better than 30 seconds,
bounded by regulatory requirements. Finally, some use cases do not
consider TTFF as a primary requirement.

Even though a lower TTFF increases the user's experience, a higher TTFF
may allow for improvements in the system's capabilities in terms of
accuracy, coverage (indoor) or availability for a given complexity.

Consequently, a TTFF target of 10 seconds can be considered reasonable,
if it does not affect the system's ability to efficiently comply with
other requirements, in particular regulatory requirements.
Alternatively, the system might support mechanisms to adapt the TTFF
between 10s and 30s in order to satisfy other requirements (e.g.
regulatory).

### 6.2.2 Latency

In most of the reported use cases, the proposed latency shares a same
order of magnitude with the TTFF and the inverse of the update rate,
typically 1s or higher.

A latency lower than 500 ms is needed primarily to support:

\- Remote control (for instance for UAV), with latency target in the
order of 100 -- 200 ms.

\- Collision avoidance, for which latency is required to be better than
20 -- 30 ms (the values represent more or less the time needed to travel
the position uncertainty at the maximum speed).

Very low latency requirements might affect the complexity of the
involved positioning technologies. Moreover, the remote control
capabilities and collision avoidance functions can be supported by
multiple technological options, among other:

\- Very low latency standalone positioning technologies associated to
low latency communications,

\- Combination of accurate but high latency positioning technologies
with low latency relative positioning technologies in the UE (e.g. IMU,
positioning with D2D short range links, etc.),

\- Collision avoidance function independent of the positioning service,
using local awareness sensors like camera, ultrasound, radar, etc.

Hence, an alternative to latency requirements lower than 500 ms might be
to consider a system able to support mechanism for both remote control
and collision avoidance, for example, using a combination of positioning
technologies.

### 6.2.3 3D-position and velocity measurements

Some use cases need positioning in 3D, adding vertical accuracy targets
to the horizontal ones and featuring two classes of vertical accuracy
targets:

\- Between 2 m and 3 m. This is needed both indoor and outdoor,
typically to distinguish multiple 2D service areas overlaying each other
in a man-made environment (e.g. floors inside a building or roads
crossing each other with bridges)

\- Between 0.1 m and 0.3 m. This derives from the need to control
objects moving in 3D, in particular in vicinity of obstacles (e.g. UAV
in landing phase) whereby the positioning accuracy may be relative to
other objects (not absolute). In those cases, primarily outdoor
environment of use is considered, and these are either environment with
mild signal obstruction or enhanced positioning areas (e.g. a few tens
of meters around the docking station). Additionally, indoor use cases
with a small service area may be considered.

Accurate velocity is only required for use cases outdoor, and accuracy
better than 1 m/s is then needed only for use cases operating in
environment with mild signal obstruction.

For both the aforementioned KPIs, the combination of positioning
technologies should leverage the system's ability to support the
associated use cases.

### 6.2.4 Accuracy and availability

Horizontal accuracy and availability of the position-related data are
the primary KPIs reported by the use cases descriptions. For what
concerns positioning technologies, these two KPIs behave monotonously
with system's complexity and in opposition of each other (antagonism):

\- Higher availability, or improved accuracy of positioning-related
data, may increase the system's complexity

\- Higher availability may come at the cost of lower accuracy (and
vice-versa) for a given complexity. When measurement samples are
time-independent, their CDF provides a convenient illustration of such
behaviour.

The following figure represents two sets of data:

\- Scattered points scaled with the left axis: the availability
requirements plotted versus the horizontal accuracy requirements

\- Colour bands scaled on the right axis: the theoretical CDFs of three
normal distributions with zero-mean and standard deviation of
respectively: \[3cm -- 15cm\], \[0.5m -- 1.5m\] and \[5m -- 25m\].

NOTE: the representation of the CDF is here illustrative and does not
presume that the 5G position measurements are time-independent or follow
a normal distribution with zero mean.

height="3.4090277777777778in"}

Figure 6.2.4-1 -- Accuracy and Availability potential requirements for
the use cases

This graphical representation supports multiple interpretations, one of
them yields three groups of use cases and working points for the
horizontal accuracy:

\- Very high accuracy use cases in favourable environment of use, either
enhanced positioning areas or relatively mild outdoor environments
(limited signal obstruction). For instance, UAV, trolley and bike
sharing in dedicated areas.

\- High accuracy use cases, with less demanding availability (e.g. 90%)
or facing either outdoor or enhanced positioning areas. For instance,
most LBS use cases.

\- Use cases for which accuracy targets can be relaxed to fulfil more
demanding requirements, such as a higher availability throughout the 5G
positioning service area or low energy consumption. For instance,
emergency calls, patient location outside the hospital, and asset
management require high availability and accuracies less stringent
(above the sub-meter range).

### 6.2.5 Consideration on relative positioning 

Several use cases need positioning accuracy below 0.2 m. Their
descriptions make clear this need refers to relative positioning and a
small service area: a user need to find and pick-up the bike he rented
through a 5G-enabled application, or a UAV need to land on a docking
station. In Guidance-Navigation-Control vocabulary, such situation is
identified as a rendezvous phase, usually preceded by a homing phase.

The need to access very high accuracy, down to the decimetre level, in
2D or in 3D, during the rendezvous phase is fully justified in the
aforementioned use cases. However, until the involved UEs are in "short
range" of the rendezvous (e.g. from each other), defined as the
rendezvous service area, the positioning service primarily guides them
towards this rendezvous area. Therefore, during this homing phase, the
service can sustain less accurate positioning than during the
rendezvous.

These considerations allow deriving what "short range" is, thus defining
the size of the rendezvous service area in which relative positioning
accuracy below 0.2 m is to be achieved.

\- Prior to entering the rendezvous service area, the UEs are guided
using absolute positioning service in a enhanced positioning area. The
service must switch to rendezvous phase accuracy before the position
uncertainty of the UEs involved in the rendezvous overlap or affects the
rendezvous operations (including margin to ensure the service achieves a
high level of confidence).

\- According to the use cases description, the homing phase would be
provisioned in a enhanced positioning area, primarily outdoor, where a
positioning accuracy of 0.5m (95% or more) can be expected (potential
requirement of many use cases for this kind of service areas).

\- Therefore, the rendezvous service area does not need to be
significantly larger than 2m around the rendezvous position (e.g. around
the rented bike or the docking station).

In conclusion, the use cases requiring less than 0.2m accuracy can be
supported by the following capabilities:

\- An absolute positioning service with an accuracy less than 0.5 m in
enhanced positioning areas (homing phase)

\- A relative positioning service with an accuracy less than 0.1m (3D)
when the involved UEs are within 5 m from each other (rendezvous phase).

### 6.2.6 Respect of the user's privacy

Some use cases report the necessity to respect the user's privacy when
providing a positioning service in 5G. From the use cases description
and potential requirements, one understands that privacy is considered
in those use cases in a rather large sense, as the concepts covers,
depending on the use cases:

\- The protection of the privacy of the user or owner of the UE (e.g.
eHealth related use cases, described in clauses 5.3.1 and 5.3.2)

\- The protection of the UE's trajectory, as this trajectory can
represent a signature of the owner's identity, even if the owner's
identity is well protected or made anonymous in the system (use cases on
flow management described in clause 5.2.5, on road-user charging
described in clause 5.5.1, on support to UAV mission described in clause
5.7.1)

\- The respect of the user's consent to some positioning services (use
case on Location-based advertising push described in clause 5.2.4).

In conclusion, the following capabilities should be able to support the
use cases requiring the aforementioned privacy protection:

\- The 5G positioning services shall be able to protect, by some
mechanism, the UE's privacy and the privacy of the UE's user or owner,
including the respect of its consent to the positioning services.

NOTE 1: This includes the ability for the System to provide the
positioning services on demand without having to track continuously the
position of the involved UE.

NOTE 2: The respect of the user's consent to some positioning services
could abide by different rules in case of emergency (for example, rules
that would also receive consent from the user, but well before the
emergency occurs).

### 6.2.7 Flexibility, versatility and configurability of the positioning services

Some use cases report the need to adapt the capabilities and
performances in different situation, such as adaptation to the needs of
users, operator or 3rd parties, adaptation to the environment of use, to
the operation mode of the use case, etc. Although the needs are
expressed in different ways throughout the potential requirements of the
different use cases, they address primarily the following capabilities:

\- Adaptation of update rate to user needs, environment, energy
consumption constraints (e.g. use case on power saving mechanism
described in clause 5.2.3, waste management in described in 5.3.4)

\- Configuration by the system (also involving the user or a 3rd party)
of different working points and performances to fulfil or optimise the
service (depending on need of the user, the operator or a 3rd party), as
for instance described in clause 5.7.2 for UAV landing phase, and in a
more general way in in clauses 5.8.1 and 5.8.2.

The potential requirements sometime also make clear the aforementioned
capabilities need to be managed in a dynamic way, although latency of
any update or change to the working point is not translated in a
requirement. This is for instance the case for power saving mechanism
(described in clause 5.2.3), asset tracking (described in clause 5.6.1),
and also to support the negotiation of different location methods
(described in clause 5.8.2).

In conclusion, the following capabilities should be able to support the
use cases requiring this aforementioned adaptability and configurability
of the positioning services:

\- The 5G System shall provide different 5G positioning services with
configurable performances working points (e.g. accuracy, availability,
energy consumption, update rate, TTFF) according to the needs of users,
operators and 3rd parties.

\- The 5G system shall support mechanism to configure dynamically the
update rate of the position-related data to fulfil different
performances (e.g. power consumption, latency) or different location
modes.

6.3 Considerations on the grouping of use cases
-----------------------------------------------

In clause 5, the positioning use cases have been organised by categories
more or less mapping different verticals. They are supported by
different classes of UE, eventually transverse to some verticals, which
in turn represent another convenient way to group them:

\- Handheld and wearables UEs, primarily supporting LBS and eHealth use
cases

\- Machine-type UEs, primarily used in machine control (trolleys, UAV)
and/or transportation sector (tracking of road vehicles for traffic
management purpose)

\- Very low energy UEs, able to sustain a lifetime of 15 years with
simple batteries (e.g. AA, AAA or button-cell batteries)

As discussed in the clause 6.2, positioning accuracy supports another
reading of the use cases and another way to group them. The following
table translates the two aforementioned grouping into a common
illustration, where the cells colours are indexed on the accuracy range.

Eventually, depending on the desired level of achievement in terms of
use cases coverage (e.g. conservative, intermediate or ambitious),
different consolidated potential requirement for horizontal accuracy can
be derived from the above categories, such as those presented in table
6.3-2.

accuracy level

7 Considerations on the suitability of positioning technologies for use cases
=============================================================================

7.1 Introduction and proposed approach
--------------------------------------

In addition to the considerations developed in clause 6 on the use cases
performance targets, an initial identification of how existing
positioning technologies meet such targets is presented, with the
objective to identify targets that can be met already and in particular
others that would require new technologies to be possibly considered in
5G NR. A qualitative assessment based on a colour -- coded scale is used
as in table below.

Table 7-1: Classification scale

  ---------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------ -------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------
  Performance targets fully met (at least 95%)   Performance targets largely met (at least 68%)   Performance targets met under certain conditions   Performance targets rarely met   Performance targets never met (or met under exceptional conditions)
  ---------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------ -------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------

In the next clause, this approach is presented in more detailed tables
for the different Key Performance Indicators.

The positioning technologies captured in TS 38.305 are the baseline used
for the apportionment exercise. They can be classified into the
following categories:

\- 3GPP technologies included/to be included in TS 38.305: downlink
positioning (OTDOA), enhanced cell ID (E-CellID)

\- Non-3GPP technologies included/to be included in TS 38.305: A-GNSS,
HA-GNSS (e.g. RTK), TBS, WLAN (also with FTM, Fine-Time Measurement, as
defined in 802.11-2016), Bluetooth method

\- Positioning sensors included/to be included in TS 38.305: barometric
pressure sensor method, IMU

NOTE: TS 38.305 is expected to be updated based on the positioning
enhancements standardised for LTE Release 15 i.e. hence, the addition of
HA-GNSS to this list.

The suitability of technologies is performed for key performance
indicators and associated targets, as identified in the use cases and in
clause 6, typically:

\- Horizontal accuracy classes: 50 m, 3 m, 0.1-0.5 m (see clause 6.3)

\- Vertical accuracy: typically 2-3 m

\- Relative positioning accuracy: 0.1-0.2 m

\- Velocity accuracy: 1-5 m/s

And for different environment of use (which refers to the nature of the
environment, and not to the geographical coverage, for instance, of a
cellular network):

\- Outdoor rural (includes any outdoor with almost no obstruction)

\- Outdoor sub-urban (includes any outdoor with limited obstruction) and
urban

\- Outdoor deep urban (or any environment with very significant
obstruction)

\- Indoor

\- Enhanced positioning coverage area

The GNSS accuracy displayed below reflects performances from ETSI TS 103
246-3 \[6\] while HA-GNSS performance corresponds to state of the art
RTK results reported in literature or in technical specifications
released by GNSS receiver manufacturers. The values associated to
terrestrial positioning technologies are derived from 3GPP standards
such as TR 37.857 (Study on indoor positioning enhancements for UTRA and
LTE ) and FCC E911 Location Accuracy - Indoor Location Test Bed Report
\[7\] for 3GPP LTE and TBS, and from state of the art results for WLAN
and Bluetooth.

The potential impacts related to the infrastructure configurations and
density are reported qualitatively in the tables comments (for example,
coverage of GNSS is global, for HA-GNSS and LTE it depends on the
network deployment) or use of technologies at user level or
hybridisation of various technologies).

7.2 Suitability of existing positioning technologies for different KPIs
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

### 7.2.1 Horizontal accuracy KPI

Clause 7.2.1 maps in color-coded scale the capability of each
positioning technology to meet 3 classes of absolute horizontal accuracy
corresponding to the categorisation presented in clause 6.3: 50 m, 3 m
and 0.3 m.

7.3 Summary
-----------

The analysis presented in clause 7.2 highlights the fact that there is
no single technology capable to meet all use case positioning targets in
all environments. The results from above show that horizontal
positioning accuracy for indoor positioning may be achieved within 50
metre threshold with technologies already supported by 3GPP (including
TBS and GNSS). Using a typical indoor WLAN infrastructure with adequate
geometry, WLAN could reach the 50m target as well.

From Table 7.2.1-2 it can be seen that only GNSS satisfies a horizontal
accuracy of 3m in outdoor environments. Even in deep urban areas, GNSS
can meet this target but with an availability significantly lower than
99%.

In the case of very demanding positioning requirements, from the
positioning technologies included in LPP protocol only HA-GNSS is
suitable to meet the 0.3m target at 99% availability. Naturally, the
availability is considerably decreasing once in an urban environment.
The situation is even worse for indoor environments. To conclude, the
high accuracy positioning is not yet available in deep urban
environments, especially at an availability better than 99%. For indoor,
the situation is not better and it can be improved only by massive
infrastructure deployments. Even though in standalone mode each
positioning technology has displayed several limitations, the
performance can be significantly improved when two or more technologies
are combined. A proper integration of existing technologies, supported
by adequate infrastructure deployment may cover most need except those
marked in yellow and red, which can be a typical target for NR to
complement existing technologies (see Table 7.2-1).

met by combination multiple positioning technologies

Existing positioning technologies, 3GPP and non-3GPP such as GNSS (e.g.
BeiDou, Galileo, GLONASS, and GPS), Terrestrial Beacon Systems (TBS),
sensors (e.g. barometer, IMU), WLAN/Bluetooth-based positioning, can
cover already a wide variety of demanding use cases especially when
paired together. Even when combining all technologies, some very
demanding accuracy targets are not met and this requires new positioning
technologies, for instance based on NR. This is particularly the case to
fill the gaps of high accuracy in indoor and deep urban environments, as
well as to cover very high accuracy positioning and relative positioning
in enhanced positioning coverage . The 5G System will thereby have to
integrate a multitude of sensors and technologies based on both 3GPP and
non-3GPP positioning technologies, such as the aforementioned ones, into
a hybrid positioning scheme.

8 Consolidated potential positioning requirements
=================================================

8.1 Overall Positioning Services requirements
---------------------------------------------

\[PR-001\] The 5G System shall provide different 5G positioning
services, supported by different single and hybrid positioning methods,
to supply absolute and relative positioning.

NOTE 1: hybrid positioning methods include both the combination of 3GPP
positioning technologies and the combination of 3GPP positioning
technologies with non-3GPP positioning technologies such as GNSS (e.g.
Beidou, Galileo, GLONASS, and GPS), Terrestrial Beacon Systems (TBS),
sensors (e.g. barometer, IMU), WLAN/Bluetooth-based positioning.

\[PR-002\] The 5G System shall provide different 5G positioning services
with configurable performances working points (e.g. accuracy,
availability, energy consumption, update rate, TTFF) according to the
needs of users, operators and 3rd parties.

\[PR-003\] The 5G System shall provide 5G positioning services in
compliance with regulatory requirements.

NOTE 2: example of regulatory requirements encompasses requirements on
emergency calls (e.g. e911), reliability and safety requirement (RAMS)
applicable to some use cases and verticals, implementation of Priority,
Precedence, Preemption (PPP) mechanisms to ensure sufficient reliability
metrics are reached, etc.

\[PR-004\] The 5G system shall be able to determine the reliability, and
the uncertainty or confidence level of the position-related data.

\[PR-005\] The 5G System shall be able to provide the 5G positioning
services in case of roaming.

\[PR-006\] The 5G System shall be able to support the combination of
3GPP positioning technologies with non-3GPP positioning technologies to
achieve performances of the 5G positioning services better than those
achieved using only 3GPP positioning technologies.

NOTE 3: for instance, the combination of 3GPP positioning technologies
with non-3GPP positioning technologies such as GNSS (e.g. Beidou,
Galileo, GLONASS, and GPS), Terrestrial Beacon Systems (TBS), sensors
(e.g. barometer, IMU), WLAN/Bluetooth-based positioning, can support the
improvement of accuracy, availability, reliability and/or confidence
level. The combination of 3GPP positioning technologies with non-3GPP
positioning technologies can also support higher update rates and/or
lower latency of the position-related data.

\[PR-007\] The 5G System shall support the UE to provide its
position-related data for periods when the UE is outside the coverage of
3GPP RAT-dependent positioning technologies.

\[PR-008\] The 5G system shall be able to manage and log
position-related data in compliance with applicable traceability,
authentication and security regulatory requirements.

8.2 Positioning performance requirements
----------------------------------------

\[PR-009\] The 5G System shall be able to provide horizontal positioning
services as per the requirements and attributes reported in Table 8.2-1.

\[PR-010\] The 5G system shall be able to provide positioning service
with 3m vertical accuracy and an availability of 95% anywhere in 5G
positioning service area (for speed up to at least 160 km/h).

NOTE 1: the vertical positioning requirement should be sufficiently
accurate to determine the floor in indoor use cases and distinguish
between superposed roads in road-related use cases.

\[PR-011\] The 5G system shall be able to provide relative changes in
the UE's altitude (or height) from an initial reference point with a
vertical accuracy less than 0.2 m and an availability of 95% for some 5G
positioning services.

\[PR-012\] The 5G System shall be able to provide a relative positioning
service with a relative accuracy better than 0.2 m and an availability
of 99 % either between two UEs within 10 m of each other or between one
UE and 5G positioning nodes within 10 m of each others.

NOTE 2: 5G positioning nodes are here infrastructure equipment deployed
in the service area to enhance positioning capabilities: for instance,
some beacons deployed on the perimeter of a rendezvous area or on the
side of a warehouse.

NOTE 3: the relative positioning capability can be achieved in any
relevant 2D or 3D, Cartesian or Polar coordinate system for instance,
using either very high accuracy positioning technologies or 2-way
ranging and direction of arrival from one UE to the other.

\[PR-013\] The 5G system shall be able to provide the 5G positioning
services with a TTFF less than 30 s and, for some 5G positioning
services, shall support mechanisms to provide a TTFF less than 10s at
the expense of a relaxation of some other performances (e.g., horizontal
accuracy relaxed from 3 m to 10 m for a high accuracy positioning
service).

\[PR-014\] The 5G system shall be able to provide the 5G positioning
services with a latency lower than 1 s.

NOTE 4: the 5G system may support mechanism such as extrapolation of
position and combination of positioning technologies to provide some 5G
positioning services with latency less than 20 ms.

\[PR-015\] The 5G system shall support mechanism to determine the UE\'s
velocity outdoor with an accuracy better than 0.5 m/s and better than 5
degree bearing, and an availability of 99%.

NOTE 5: for both the aforementioned KPI, the combination of positioning
technologies will leverage the system's ability to fulfil the
requirements.

\[PR-016\] The 5G System shall be able to provide a positioning service
involving an average of less than 20 mJ of the UE's energy per position
fix and involving a peak power less than 200 mW.

NOTE 6: the 5G positioning services should be fulfilled without
affecting the UE's battery overall lifetime by more than 5 % or without
reducing the UE's battery lifetime by more than 10 months out of a total
of 15 years' lifetime.

NOTE 7: the 5G System needs to consider UEs with limited form factor,
limited CPU power, and limited radio access technology support (e.g.
eMTC type communication only).

8.3 Operational Requirements
----------------------------

\[PR-017\] The 5G system shall be able to request the UE to provide its
position-related-data on request, triggered by an event or periodically
and to request the UE to stop providing its position-related data
periodically.

NOTE 1: This requirement does not preclude whether the position is
computed in the UE or elsewhere in the 5G System (e.g. core network).
Indeed, the determination of the UE's position or location requires the
UE to transmit some information (e.g. position, OTDOA measurements made
on PRS, some signal allowing the UE's identification and UTDOA
measurements in the nodes, etc.) which refers to position-related data.

\[PR-018\] The 5G system shall allow the UE to trigger a different
update rate of the position-related data based on whether the UE is
moving or not.

\[PR-019\] The 5G system shall support mechanism to configure
dynamically the update rate of the position-related data to fulfil
different performances (e.g. power consumption, latency, etc.) or
different location modes.

NOTE 2: for example, the 5G System needs to be able to request the UE to
provide its location periodically with an update rate ranging from one
location every \[1 s-10 s\] in location normal mode to one location
every \[30 s-300 s, or more\] in location power saving mode. The 5G
System needs to allow UEs to sleep for extended periods (e.g. one week),
without requiring the UE to update its position data.

\[PR-020\] The 5G system shall be able to determine the position-related
data of the 5G positioning services with any update rate ranging from
one set of position-related data every 0.1 s to one set of
position-related data every month.

\[PR-021\] The 5G System shall be able to make the position-related data
available to an application server.

NOTE 3: the latency to make the position-related data available can be
tailored to the use cases.

\[PR-022\] The 5G System shall be able to negotiate the positioning
methods according to the operator's policy or the application's
requirements or the user's preferences and support mechanism to allow
the network or the UE to trigger this negotiation.

\[PR-023\] The 5G System shall be able to access to the positioning
methods used for calculating the position-related data and to the
associated uncertainty/confidence indicators.

\[PR-024\] The 5G system shall supply a method for either the operator
or a 3rd party to configure and manage different positioning services
for different users according to agreement between operator and 3rd
party.

\[PR-025\] The 5G system shall be able to supply a method to support the
3rd party to request 5G system to trigger location methods negotiation.

\[PR-026\] The 5G System shall enable an MCX UE to use the 5G
positioning services to determine its position with the associated
uncertainty/confidence of the position, on request, triggered by an
event or periodically.

8.4 Security-related Requirements
---------------------------------

\[PR-027\] The 5G positioning services shall be able to protect, by some
mechanism, the UE's privacy and the privacy of the UE's user or owner,
including the respect of its consent to the positioning services.

NOTE 1: this includes the ability for the System to provide the
positioning services on demand without having to track continuously the
position of the involved UE.

NOTE 2: the respect of the user's consent to some positioning services
could abide by different rules in case of emergency (for example, rules
that would also receive consent from the user, but well before the
emergency occurs).

\[PR-028\] The 5G System shall support mechanisms to protect
positioning-related data against tampering and spoofing.

\[PR-029\] The 5G System shall support mechanisms to detect tampering
and spoofing attempts on the position-related data.

9 Conclusions and recommendations
=================================

The current TR provides a number of use cases for positioning services
relating to 5G verticals such as LBS, industry and e-health, regulatory
use cases (emergency call and first responder), road, rail, maritime and
aerial.

The potential requirements reported for each use cases are compiled into
a set of potential consolidated positioning requirements, defining
different classes of positioning services, in 2D and 3D, for both
outdoor and indoor environment of use, in whole 5G positioning service
area or limited to enhanced positioning areas like, for instance, a
shopping mall or a hospital campus.

The resulting potential requirements identified in this TR can be
considered for the development of normative requirements. It is
therefore proposed to consider the inclusion of these requirements in
existing specifications for 5G services (e.g. TS 22.261).

######### Annex A: Mapping matrices between use cases' potential requirements and potential consolidated positioning requirements 

The following two tables show how the potential consolidated positioning
requirements capture the potential requirements proposed for each use
case in clause 5, either directly, or by also taking into account the
considerations developed in clauses 6 and 7.

The 1st table (Table A-1) associates each requirement of clause 8 to its
parents requirements (potential requirements from use cases in clause 5)
and to the related considerations in clauses 6 and 7.

The 2nd table (Table A-2 shows how the potential requirements of each
use case are covered by the consolidated requirements.
