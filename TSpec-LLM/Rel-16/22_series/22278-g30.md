receive traffic through multiple PDNs.

6.3 Quality of Service
----------------------

The Evolved Packet System shall have the ability to provide a quality of
service equal to or better than the QoS requirements specified for GSM
and UMTS. Quality of Service from the customer\'s perspective is to be
considered in phases as specified in ETSI TS 102 250-1\[6\].

Figure 2: Phases of service use from customer\'s point of view

Figure 2 shows the different phases (Quality of Service aspects) during
service use from the customer\'s point of view.

The meaning of these QoS aspects are:

1\) **Network Access:** The network indication on the display of the
mobile is a signal to the customer that he can use the service of this
network operator (or any other means to indicate to the user that a
network is available).

2\) **Service Access:** If the customer wants to use a service, the
network operator should provide him as fast as possible access to the
service.

3\) **Service Integrity:** This describes the Quality of Service during
service use.

4\) **Service Retainability:** Service Retainability describes the
termination of services (in accordance with or against the will of the
user).

In particular the Evolved Packet System shall provide for the following:

\- There should be no perceptible deterioration of audio quality of a
voice call during and following handover between dissimilar CS and PS
access networks, and transitions between PS access networks supporting
different IP protocol versions.

\- There should be no loss of data, as a result of handovers between
dissimilar fixed and mobile access systems, including those that support
different versions of the IP protocol.

\- There should be no discernable difference in perceived service
quality for users receiving services via unicast and users receiving the
same service via multicast.

\- The Evolved Packet System shall support QoS differentiations for
unicast bearers.

\- The Evolved Packet System shall support QoS backwards compatibility
to earlier 3GPP QoS releases.

\- It shall be possible for the Evolved Packet System to maintain
end-to-end QoS without modification when the terminal moves from one
access system to a new access system, and the new access system supports
the required QoS.

\- It shall be possible for the Evolved Packet System to change QoS,
when the terminal moves from one access system to a new access system
and the new access system can not provide the same QoS as the old access
system or the new access system can provide higher QoS.

\- It shall be possible for the Evolved Packet System to support service
continuity for a terminal changing access system and the new access
system cannot provide the same QoS as the old one.

\- The Evolved Packet System shall support transport QoS
differentiations for multicast bearers.

\- It shall be possible for the Evolved Packet System to maintain QoS
within a multicast session without QoS changes for other members of the
session when a terminal joins or leaves the multicast session or moves
to a new access system.

\- The Evolved Packet System network shall support a minimum of 8 levels
of QoS in parallel.

\- The Evolved Packet System network shall support a minimum of 4
parallel RT QoS levels with the appropriate QoS differentiation.

Note 1: The requirement for the number of simultaneously supported QoS
levels is independent of any MBMS QoS levels.

\- Multiple RT services, with similar QoS requirements, shall be served
by the same RT QoS level and multiple NRT services, with similar QoS
requirements, shall be served by the same NRT QoS level.

The maximum number of parallel RT and NRT services shall not be limited
in the Evolved Packet System including the UE. Only the number of
parallel RT and NRT QoS levels are limited to the upper value supported
by the Evolved Packet System.

\- Differentiated handling based on QoS is needed for different traffic
types.

\- The Evolved Packet System shall support parallel operation of RT and
NRT services per user.

Note 2: The different QoS levels provided for RT and NRT services would
be differentiated with regards to e.g. maximum end-to-end delay, packet
size, packet drop percentage, etc. Bandwidth is not used to define a QoS
level.

6.4 Support of Multicast and Broadcast Services
-----------------------------------------------

The Evolved Packet System shall be able to support Multicast and
Broadcast Services which shall be enhanced especially from some aspects,
e.g. optimized service provisioning procedures, better performance
compared to current MBMS system, and support of multiple access systems.

6.5 Support of Emergency Calls
------------------------------

The Evolved Packet System shall support IMS emergency calls applicable
to the PS domain, defined in TS 22.101 \[21\]

6.6 Differentiated paging for voice over E-UTRAN terminations
-------------------------------------------------------------

More efficient radio resource usage can be achieved by using a more
aggressive paging profile for voice over E-UTRAN services than for other
services using the IMS signaling bearer, requiring a distinction to be
made between voice over E-UTRAN and non-voice over E-UTRAN traffic.

As a network option, the EPS shall support a mechanism to apply a
different paging policy to E-UTRAN access for voice services vs. other
services using the IMS signaling bearer.

6.7 Support of streaming services
---------------------------------

A 3GPP system shall support a mechanism to indicate to UEs that operator
streaming services are available.

The 3GPP system shall be able to support UE caching for streaming
services.

Based on operator policy, the 3GPP system shall support a mechanism that
the subscribed UE is configured with the list of authorized content
providers and data volume for UE caching of streaming services.

The 3GPP system shall be able to schedule delivery of a
download-and-play service to UE to the off-peak hours.

The 3GPP system shall be able to support local connection to local
streaming servers according to operator's policy.

The 3GPP system shall be able to configure local streaming service area
according to operator's policy.

The 3GPP system shall be able to identify a user is in the specific
local streaming service area.

The 3GPP system shall be able to identify a user is not in the specific
local streaming service area and stop the local streaming service.

The 3GPP system shall be able to deliver streaming content via local
service delivery immediately or postponed according to user's
preference.

According to the mobility of the users who do not always stay in one
place, the 3GPP system should be able to adaptively change video server
and the route to continue supply experience for streaming service, e.g.
from a local streaming server to a non-local streaming server, vice
versa.

According to operator's policy, the 3GPP system shall be able to
configure which context information is related with streaming route.

The 3GPP system shall be able to collect context information related to
update streaming route according to operator's policy.

According to agreement between application server and Operator, the 3GPP
system shall support the operator or the 3rd party to configure which
user profile information belonging to the application server should be
shared with the 3GPP system.

According to operator's policy, the 3GPP system shall support the SHE
which is deployed in different local area (no matter belongs to operator
or the 3rd party) to configure which radio environment information can
be shared to the application layer which is hosted in the SHE.

According to operator's policy, the 3GPP system shall support the SHE
which is deployed in different local area (no matter belongs to operator
or the 3rd party) to get radio environment information based on the
configuration.

6.8 IoT resource efficiency
---------------------------

The 3GPP system shall support efficient transmission of IP data and
non-IP data to/from a UE.

The 3GPP system shall support efficient transmission of small data
to/from a UE.

The 3GPP system shall minimize control and user plane resource usage for
stationary UEs (e.g., lower signalling to user data resources usage
ratio).

The 3GPP system shall optimize the resource usage of the control plane
and/or user plane for transfer of small data units.

The 3GPP system shall support methods to minimize the usage of battery
resources at the UE.

6.9 Context aware network
-------------------------

The 3GPP system shall support network resource utilization efficiently
and network optimization based on context information, including:

\- network conditions, such as network load and congestion information;

\- information on served UEs such as access information (e.g., 3GPP
access, non-3GPP access), cell type (e.g., macro cell, small cell);

\- information on prioritized communication such as user subscription
profile and priority level, priority services (e.g., MPS, Emergency, and
Public Safety), application used for priority communications (e.g.,
voice, video, and data) and traffic associated with priority
communications (signalling and media).

 7 Multi-access and seamless mobility
====================================

7.1 Mobility management
-----------------------

### 7.1.1 Heterogeneous access systems mobility

![](media/image4.wmf){width="7.341666666666667in"
height="4.438194444444444in"}

Figure 3: Heterogeneous access system mobility between 3GPP Legacy
Systems or E-UTRAN and non 3GPP Access Systems including Fixed Access
systems

The Evolved Packet System shall support mobility between heterogeneous
access systems.

The Evolved Packet System shall provide mobility mechanisms to support
frequent handovers within and across 3GPP legacy systems or E-UTRAN and
non 3GPP access systems in order to avoid service degradation.

The Evolved Packet System shall support mobility mechanisms that
accommodates access systems within Rel-7 and earlier.

### 7.1.2 Local breakout

The Evolved Packet System shall allow for local breakout. Local breakout
means that for a user which makes mobility within and across one
operator-defined network region, routing is optimized such that user
plane traffic does not need to leave the current region. An operator may
define network regions e.g., according to administrative domains. Local
breakout is applicable for user-to-user traffic as well as for
3GPP-operator provided services (including internet access).

Local breakout shall be allowed independently from the access system
being used.

Local breakout shall be allowed in both the non-roaming and the roaming
case.

The use of local breakout shall be authorised by the HPLMN. If local
breakout is not authorised, the user plane traffic shall be handled in
the home routed mode.

### 7.1.3 Fixed Access Systems

The Evolved Packet System shall be able to support fixed access systems
with very limited or no mobility functionality.

The Evolved Packet System shall be able to support mobility within and
across 3GPP and non-3GPP access systems including fixed access systems

### 7.1.4 Service continuity

#### 7.1.4.1 General

Service shall be maintained during and following changes of 3GPP access
systems and non 3GPP systems.

Service shall be maintained during and following a change of network in
either direction between a Rel-7 and earlier network and an Evolved
Packet System.

It shall be possible to support Inter-PLMN handover with seamless
service continuity within a 3GPP specified access system (UTRAN,
E-UTRAN).

When the access system changes, Multicast and Broadcast services shall
be able to continue with their corresponding Multicast and Broadcast
services, if the corresponding services are provided in the target
access system.

NOTE: Corresponding Multicast and Broadcast services are the Multicast
and Broadcast services in the target access system which is associated
to the Multicast and Broadcast services in the source access system,
providing similar service experience, e. g. with same content but
different bit-rate.

The 3GPP system shall minimise packet loss during inter- and/or intra-
access technology changes for some or all connections associated with a
UE.

height="2.1534722222222222in"}

Figure 4: Inter-PLMN handover with seamless service continuity within a
3GPP specified access system

#### 7.1.4.2 Service continuity at domain and RAT change for TS 11, TS 12 and equivalent PS service

It shall be possible to support continuity of an established voice call,
i.e. between a TS11, TS12 and an equivalent PS service, when the UE
moves between two different domains and RATs. The user experience shall
be as far as possible unaffected by the change of domain and RAT. The
RAT change procedure executed to enable service continuity for an
established voice call shall target an interruption time not higher than
300 ms.

RAT change and domain selection shall be under the control of the
registered PLMN. When the UE is roaming, it shall be possible for the
VPLMN to take into account any user\'s HPLMN operator policy.

To support service continuity of an established voice call a UE shall
not be required to support simultaneous radio transmission via different
3GPP defined RATs

NOTE: In the case of CS emergency calls (TS12) the service continuity at
domain and RAT change can only be performed if IMS emergency calls are
supported by the target system.

#### 7.1.4.2A Voice Call Service continuity between 3GPP defined RATs and non 3GPP defined RATs

Continuity of an established voice call, i.e. between a TS11 and an
equivalent PS service, when the UE moves between 3GPP defined RATs and
non 3GPP defined RATs, shall be supported provided that the non-3GPP
defined RATs is connected to the 3GPP system via the Evolved Packet
Core.

The user experience shall be as far as possible unaffected by the change
of RAT.

#### 7.1.4.3 Service continuity between E-UTRAN and 3GPP2 accesses on Evolved Packet Core

The Evolved Packet System shall support bidirectional service continuity
between cdma2000 1xRTT Revision A \[8\], \[9\], \[10\], \[11\], \[12\],
\[13\], \[14\], \[15\] and E-UTRAN.

Note 1: if bi-directional support is not practical, service continuity
from E-UTRAN to cdma2000 1xRTT Revision A should have the higher
priority.

Note 2: The CS component of cdma2000 1xRTT Revision A is not expected to
be connected to the Evolved Packet Core.

The Evolved Packet System shall support bidirectional service continuity
between cdma2000 HRPD (1xEV-DO) Revision A \[17\], \[14\], \[15\],
\[16\] and E-UTRAN for best effort and real-time applications.

The Evolved Packet System shall support bidirectional service continuity
between cdma2000 HRPD (1xEV-DO) Revision 0 \[18\], \[14\], \[15\],
\[16\] and E-UTRAN for best effort applications.

#### 7.1.4.4 Service continuity between 3GPP and WiMAX access on Evolved Packet Core

The Evolved Packet System shall support bidirectional service continuity
between Mobile WiMAX \[20\], \[22\], \[23\], \[24\] and GERAN PS.

The Evolved Packet System shall support bidirectional service continuity
between Mobile WiMAX \[20\], \[22\], \[23\], \[24\] and UTRAN PS.

The Evolved Packet System shall support bidirectional service continuity
between Mobile WiMAX \[20\], \[22\], \[23\], \[24\] and E-UTRAN.

NOTE: The above requirements assume that the service continuity takes
place through the Evolved Packet Core.

### 7.1.5 Access network discovery

To avoid unnecessary background scan by the UE and to facilitate service
continuity by the UE it shall be possible for the VPLMN and the HPLMN to
provide the UE with access network information pertaining to locally
supported non-3GPP access technologies, in a resource efficient and
secure manner. This mechanism is meant to facilitate changes, including
service continuity, between 3GPP access systems and non 3GPP access
systems and vice versa. The information may be restricted to the access
technologies the UE can use. To reduce battery drain, a UE should
minimise the frequency of scanning for different access technologies.

When discovering non-3GPP accesses a UE shall be able to receive
information from a non-3GPP access network concerning to which PLMN, or
PLMNs, the non-3GPP access network provides access.

NOTE: The capability to provide such information by a non-3GPP access
network is out of scope of 3GPP.

When a UE receives service via a non-3GPP access it shall be possible
for the PLMN that provides the non-3GPP access to indicate local
availability of 3GPP access to the UE,, in a secure manner, subject to
capabilities of the non-3GPP access network.

### 7.1.6 Steering of access

When a UE is accessing the Evolved Packet Core via E-UTRA, the operator
of the PLMN that provides the access (registered PLMN or RPLMN for
short) may request the UE to use - any or a specific - non-3GPP RAT.
Similarly, if a UE is accessing the Evolved Packet Core via a non-3GPP
RAT then the RPLMN may want to request the UE to use E-UTRA. The reason
for such steering may be load balancing (for camped- and traffic load
balancing), operator policy, private networks/home cells, service based
mobility control etc.

The RPLMN shall be able to download on the UE a list of preferred access
technologies in priority order. If, while the UE is registered on that
PLMN, an access technology with higher priority than the one currently
used is detected, the UE shall attempt to use the higher priority access
network to access the RPLMN.

The UE shall only perform access technology selection within the RPLMN.

In case the UE is connected to the PLMN via a non-3GPP access, then the
PLMN reselection procedures specified for that access technology may be
executed.

Note 1: The PLMN operator may provide access to the Evolved Packet Core
either through an own access network (E-UTRA or non-3GPP access) or in
collaboration with an access network operator that operates a non-3GPP
access network.

Note 2: A specific non-3GPP RAT may e.g. be identified by RAT type and
the access network name (as advertized by the access network), or a list
of access network names.

The HPLMN may also provide the UE with a list of preferred access
technologies in priority order for use in the RPLMN. Only one list of
preferred access technologies can be active at a time and the list
provided by the RPLMN takes precedence over the list provided by the
HPLMN. The list of preferred access technologies received from the VPLMN
is specific to that VPLMN and PLMNs equivalent to it.

### 7.1.7 CS fallback

#### 7.1.7.1 General

For those services delivered via the HPLMN that the HPLMN only supports
in the CS domain (e.g. voice services), when such services are invoked
while the UE is configured to use CS Fallback and registered in the
E-UTRAN (either in the HPLMN or in a VPLMN), it shall be possible for
the EPS to request the UE to perform a change of radio access technology
in order to deliver the service over UTRAN or GERAN or 1xRTT.

In the case of an incoming CS service to a UE that is registered for CS
services and active in E-UTRAN, the EPS shall transfer the CLI to the UE
if available and the calling party has not restricted the presentation,
prior to triggering CS fallback. Depending on UE configuration and when
the UE is in connected mode, the user or an application on behalf of the
user may request to accept or reject CS fallback before performing a
change of radio access technology. The default behaviour of the UE is to
accept the CS fallback.

CS fallback shall not be applicable to an Indirect 3GPP Communication.

NOTE: An Evolved ProSe UE-to-Network Relay that is also in a Direct 3GPP
Communication with the network may be subject to CS fallback in the
Direct 3GPP Communication. In this case, any Indirect 3GPP Communication
supported by the Evolved ProSe UE-to-Network Relay would have to be
discontinued.

#### 7.1.7.2 Roaming in a VPLMN not supporting CS fallback

When a UE that is configured to use CS fallback registers over E-UTRAN
in a VPLMN not supporting CS fallback the default behaviour of the UE is
to attempt to select a GERAN/UTRAN/1xRTT CS radio access technology in
the VPLMN or in a PLMN equivalent to the VPLMN. The default behaviour of
the UE is not to autonomously attempt to (re-)select the E-UTRAN for the
duration of the time the UE stays in a VPLMN and PLMNs equivalent to the
VPLMN.

The default behaviour may be changed based on user preference settings.

The UE may offer the user to perform a PLMN scan and display the list of
available PLMNs. The selection of a different PLMN is performed using
the manual mode.

### 7.1.8 Service Reachability

The Evolved Packet System may provide functionality to enable user
access to PLMN IP-based services from outside of the PLMN\'s domain via
non-3GPP access technologies under conditions where there are IP
traffic-flow restrictions (e.g. allow only HTTP traffic). Such
functionality is known as Service Reachability.

When the Evolved Packet System provides Service Reachability, the
following requirements apply:

\- pre-existing EPS security shall be maintained; and

\- the third party that placed the IP traffic-flow restriction shall be
able to prohibit Service Reachability by blocking PLMN IP-based services
intentionally.

Note 1: Examples of a third party include enterprises and internet
service providers whose traffic restriction lie outside the operator\'s
domain.

Note 2: Service Reachability can also be achieved by the network
operator remotely configuring the elements with firewall function,
provided there is a trust relationship between the network operator and
the operator of the elements with firewall function.

7.2 IFOM Service requirements
-----------------------------

Simultaneous active mode of operation is an optional capability for
multimode UEs, which support 3GPP and WLAN access. UE supporting
simultaneous active mode of operation between one set of technologies
may not be capable to support simultaneous active mode of operation
between a different technology set (e.g. due to radio interference
limitations).

The following requirements apply to the case of UEs with multiple
interfaces which will simultaneously connect to 3GPP access and one
single WLAN access.

\- It shall be possible to provide service continuity when the UE moves
from the 3GPP access to WLAN access and vice versa.

\- If the UE is under the coverage of more than one access, including
3GPP and WLAN accesses and communicates using multiple accesses
simultaneously, it shall be possible to select one access when a flow is
started and re-distribute the flows to/from a UE between accesses while
connected.

\- It shall be possible for the operator to enable and control via
policies the simultaneous usage of multiple accesses.

\- It shall be possible to distribute IP flows to/from a UE between
available accesses based on the characteristics of the flows and the
capabilities of the available accesses, subjected to user\'s preferences
and operator\'s policies.

\- It shall be possible for the operator to define policies for the
control of the distribution of IP flows between available accesses. Each
policy shall include a list of preferred accesses and whether the policy
may be overridden by the user\'s preferences.

NOTE: The possibility of manual selection or user override is not
precluded.

> These policies may be defined per APN, per IP flow class under any APN
> or per IP flow class under a specific APN. The IP flow class
> identifies a type of service (e.g. IMS voice) or an operator defined
> aggregation of services.
>
> The policies apply with the following priority order:

1.  Policies per IP flow class under a specific APN.

2.  Policies per IP flow class under any APN.

3.  Policies per APN.

\- Distribution of flows to/from a UE between available accesses based
on the characteristics of the flows and/or the capabilities of the
available accesses shall be possible for flows exchanged by both
operator controlled (e.g. IMS) and non operator controlled (e.g. web and
mail access) applications/services.

\- It shall be possible to move all the flows to/from a UE out of a
certain access in case the UE loses connectivity with that access (e.g.
UE moves out of coverage of a WLAN access while maintaining connectivity
through the 3GPP access).

\- Re-distribution of flows to/from a UE between accesses may be
triggered by changes to the characteristics of the flows (e.g. QoS
requirements) or the capabilities of the available accesses (e.g. due to
network congestion, mobility event, or UE discovers a new access) during
the connection.

7A Requirements for Proximity Services
======================================

7A.0 General 
------------

The requirements listed in this clause (7A) exclude GSM and UMTS.
Proximity Services shall not impact either of GSM and UMTS.

7A.0A Feature description (Informative)
---------------------------------------

### 7A.0A.1 ProSe Discovery

ProSe Discovery identifies that ProSe-enabled UEs are in proximity of
each other, using E-UTRA (with or without E-UTRAN) or EPC when
permission, authorisation and proximity criteria are fulfilled. The
proximity criteria can be configured by the operator.

The use of ProSe Discovery must be authorised by the operator, and the
authorisation can be on a \"per UE\" basis, or a \"per UE per
application\" basis. An authorised application can interact with the
ProSe Discovery feature to request the use of certain ProSe Discovery
preferences.

The network controls the use of E-UTRAN resources used for ProSe
Discovery for a ProSe-enabled UE served by E-UTRAN.

ProSe Discovery can be used as a standalone process (i.e. it is not
necessarily followed by ProSe Communication) or as an enabler for other
services.

### 7A.0A.2 ProSe Communication

ProSe Communication enables establishment of new communication paths
between two or more ProSe-enabled UEs that are in Communication Range.
The ProSe Communication path could use E-UTRA or WLAN. In the case of
WLAN, only ProSe-assisted WLAN direct communication (i.e. when ProSe
assists with connection establishment management and service continuity)
is considered part of ProSe Communication.

The network controls the use of E-UTRAN resources used for ProSe
Communication for a ProSe-enabled UE served by E-UTRAN. The use of ProSe
Communication must be authorised by the operator.

According to operator policy a UE\'s communication path can be switched
between an EPC Path and a ProSe Communication path and a UE can also
have concurrent EPC and ProSe Communication paths.

ProSe Communication is also facilitated by the use of an Evolved ProSe
UE-to-Network Relay, which acts as a relay between E-UTRAN and Evolved
ProSe Remote UEs. The use of this relay function is controlled by the
network.

For Public Safety specific usage:

\- ProSe Communication can start without the use of ProSe Discovery if
the Public Safety ProSe-enabled UEs are in Communication Range.

\- Public Safety ProSe-enabled UEs must be able to establish the
communication path directly between Public Safety ProSe-enabled UEs,
regardless of whether the Public Safety ProSe-enabled UE is served by
E-UTRAN, as well as being able to participate in ProSe Group
Communication or ProSe Broadcast Communication between two or more
Public Safety ProSe-enabled UEs which are in proximity. Any of the
involved Public Safety ProSe-enabled UEs need to have authorisation from
the operator.

> \- In addition, ProSe Communication can also take place over a ProSe
> UE-to-UE Relay, a form of relay in which a Public Safety ProSe-enabled
> UE acts as a ProSe E-UTRA Communication relay between two other Public
> Safety ProSe-enabled UEs.

7A.1 General Requirements for Proximity Services
------------------------------------------------

Based on operator policy and user choice, the proximity of two
ProSe-enabled UEs shall be determinable; for example, using direct radio
signals or via the operator network.

Subject to user and operator settings, the 3GPP system shall be able to
support the usage of WLAN direct discovery.

In the case the ProSe-enabled UE supports WLAN direct discovery, the
3GPP network shall be able to configure applications in the UE to use
E-UTRA direct discovery or WLAN direct discovery or both for discovering
other ProSe-enabled UEs.

ProSe Discovery shall be able to determine whether or not other
ProSe-enabled UEs are of interest to a discovering ProSe-enabled UE. A
ProSe-enabled UE is of interest to a discovering ProSe-enabled UE if its
proximity needs to be known by one or more authorised applications.

Subject to user and operator settings, a ProSe-enabled UE shall be able
to be discoverable only by other ProSe-enabled UEs in proximity that are
explicitly permitted by the discoverable ProSe-enabled UE.

NOTE: \'explicitly permitted\' refers to Restricted ProSe Discovery.

Subject to user and operator settings, a ProSe-enabled UE shall be able
to be discoverable by all other ProSe-enabled UEs in proximity without
explicit permission. The ProSe-enabled UEs can be served by the same or
different PLMN, including when roaming.

NOTE: \'without explicit permission\' refers to Open ProSe Discovery.

All requirements for ProSe Discovery also apply when one or both of the
ProSe-enabled UEs involved in ProSe Discovery are roaming in a VPLMN.

Operator policy disabling or limiting individual ProSe features shall
override any user choice.

The following requirements apply to the case where ProSe-enabled UEs use
E-UTRA to determine proximity of other ProSe-enabled UEs:

\- The operator shall be able to dynamically control the proximity
criteria for ProSe Discovery. Examples of the criteria include radio
range and geographic range.

\- ProSe Discovery shall support a minimum of three range classes -- for
example short, medium and maximum range.

\- The operator shall be able to authorise per subscription the maximum
range class ProSe Discovery is allowed to use.

\- The ProSe Discovery process shall enable authorised applications to
request and to use a certain range class when discovering other
ProSe-enabled UEs.

\- The ProSe Discovery process shall enable authorised applications to
request and to use a certain range class when the ProSe-enabled UE is
being discovered by other ProSe-enabled UEs.

NOTE: For the case where ProSe-enabled UEs use WLAN direct discovery to
determine proximity of other ProSe-enabled UEs, the range is determined
by the underlying technology.

The operator shall be able to dynamically control the proximity criteria
for any ProSe E-UTRA Communication (including ProSe E-UTRA Communication
between two ProSe-enabled UEs, ProSe Group Communication and ProSe
Broadcast Communication). Examples of the criteria include:
Communication Range, channel conditions, achievable QoS.

The impact of ProSe Discovery and ProSe Communication on E-UTRA radio
usage, network usage and battery consumption should be minimized. This
requirement applies to any ProSe E-UTRA Communication between two
ProSe-enabled UEs, ProSe Group Communication, ProSe Broadcast
Communication, and ProSe-assisted WLAN direct communication.

ProSe shall support the simultaneous operation of a large number of
applications on a ProSe-enabled UE, ensuring that the 3GPP system
provides ProSe Discovery proximity information only to applications that
were authorised by the 3GPP operator.

An application on a ProSe-enabled UE shall be able to use ProSe
Discovery to request EPC ProSe to determine the proximity of another
ProSe-enabled UE; EPC ProSe shall be able to determine proximity of two
ProSe-enabled UEs and inform the requesting application of their
proximity.

The operator shall be able to enable or disable the ProSe Discovery
feature in its network.

The system shall be capable of monitoring communication characteristics
(e.g. channel condition, QoS of the path, volume of traffic etc.) on the
ProSe E-UTRA Communication path, regardless of whether there is an
existing data session on the EPS path. This requirement applies to any
ProSe E-UTRA Communication between two ProSe-enabled UEs, ProSe Group
Communication and ProSe Broadcast Communication. The monitored
communication characteristics on the ProSe E-UTRA Communication path
(e.g. channel condition, QoS of the path, volume of traffic etc.) may be
different for ProSe E-UTRA Communication between two ProSe-enabled UEs,
ProSe Group Communication and ProSe Broadcast Communication.

The establishment of a user traffic session on the ProSe E-UTRA

9 Security and privacy
======================

9.1 General
-----------

The Evolved Packet System shall provide a high level of security and
privacy for users and Evolved Packet System operators.

9.2 Security requirements
-------------------------

The Evolved Packet System shall provide a high level of security,
equivalent or better than Rel-7 3GPP systems.

Any possible lapse in security in one access technology shall not
compromise security of other accesses.

The Evolved Packet System should provide protection against threats and
attacks including those present in the Internet.

The Evolved Packet System shall support information authenticity between
the terminal and Evolved Packet Systems.

The Evolved Packet System shall allow for a network to hide of internal
network elements from the UE.

Security policy shall be under the control of the home operator.

The security solution should not interfere with service delivery or 3GPP
inter-access handovers in a way that is noticeable to end-users or
service providers.

Appropriate traffic protection measures should be provided by the
Evolved Packet System.

The Evolved Packet System shall provide appropriate mechanisms to enable
lawful intercept.

The Evolved Packet System shall ensure that no unauthorized user can
obtain a legitimate IP address that can be used to establish
communication or enable malicious attacks on evolved system entities.

Release 99 or later Releases\' USIM application on the UICC is required
to authenticate a user in an Evolved Packet System and hence allowing
the user to get services in the Evolved Packet System according to
her/his subscription.

NOTE: The above requirement is applicable when providing access to the
EPC via E-UTRAN.

Once authenticated via a 3GPP or Evolved Packet System, the USIM shall
not be required to re-authenticate upon changing between these systems,
unless specifically requested by the operator (PLMN).

NOTE: It may be possible to use other applications on the UICC in order
to provide authentication on the 3GPP or Evolved Packet System (e.g. for
connection to IMS). In addition, in case it is desirable to improve the
level of security or to add new security mechanisms for accessing the
Evolved Packet System compared to the one provided in Rel-7, a
revised/upgraded application on the UICC may be required.

9.3 Privacy requirements
------------------------

The Evolved Packet System shall provide several appropriate levels of
user privacy including communication confidentiality, location privacy,
and identity protection.

The privacy of the contents, origin, and destination of a particular
communication shall be protected from disclosure to unauthorised
parties.

The Evolved Packet System shall be able to hide the identities of users
from unauthorised third parties.

It shall be possible to provide no disclosure, at any level of
granularity, of location, location-related information, e.g. geographic
and routing information, or information from which a user\'s location
can be determined, to unauthorised parties, including another party on a
communication.

9.4 ProSe Security, Authorization and Privacy Requirements
----------------------------------------------------------

The Evolved Packet System shall support the following requirements for
ProSe security, authorization and privacy. The requirements listed in
this sub-clause exclude GSM and UMTS.

When operating ProSe (in both public safety and general cases), the EPS
shall be able to support regional or national regulatory requirements,
(e.g. lawful interception, PWS).

When offering ProSe, the EPS shall respect local regulatory frameworks
on the use of licensed spectrum.

The EPS shall ensure that the confidentiality and integrity of both user
data and network signalling over the ProSe Communication path to a level
comparable with that provided by the existing 3GPP system. This
requirement applies to any ProSe E-UTRA Communication between two
ProSe-enabled UEs, ProSe Group Communication, ProSe Broadcast
Communication and ProSe-assisted WLAN direct communication.

A mechanism shall be provided to ensure the confidentiality and
integrity of user data and signalling over the ProSe Communication path
for Public Safety UEs not served by E-UTRAN.

Existing 3GPP security mechanisms shall be reused whenever possible and
appropriate.

The level of security provided by the existing EPS shall not be
adversely affected when ProSe is enabled.

The EPS shall protect the confidentiality of the subscriber\'s, UE\'s,
and user\'s permanent identities used in the EPS when ProSe Discovery
and/or ProSe E-UTRA Communication are used. This requirement applies to
any ProSe E-UTRA Communication between two ProSe-enabled UEs, ProSe
Group Communication and ProSe Broadcast Communication. The EPS shall
have confidentiality features that enable the subscriber\'s, UE\'s, and
user\'s permanent identities to be protected when ProSe-assisted WLAN
direct communication is used.

The system shall ensure the authenticity of the ProSe Discovery
information used by an application that is authorised by the operator
and the user.

The EPS shall be able to restrict ProSe Discovery information to the
ProSe-enabled UEs and applications that have been authorised by the
users and operator.

*The permission to be discoverable is given by the user and shall be
executed by the EPS, subject to operator control, on a per-application
basis.*

Authentication shall allow for security-enablement of large groups,
regardless of whether group members have discovered each other when
being served by E-UTRAN or not.

The operator shall be able to enable or disable its ProSe Discovery
feature.

The operator shall be able to authorise discovery operations for each
individual ProSe-enabled UE, including by pre-provisioning of the UE.

The operator shall be able to authorise the ability of a ProSe-enabled
UE to be discoverable by other ProSe-enabled UEs.

The operator shall be able to authorise the ability of a ProSe-enabled
UE to discover other ProSe-enabled UEs.

The operator shall be able to authorise the use of ProSe Discovery
information by an application.

Based on user input, a ProSe-enabled UE shall be able to allow the use
of ProSe Discovery information by an application.

The network shall be able to authorise a third-party application to use
ProSe capability features, by interacting with the ProSe-enabled UE

The operator shall be able to authorise the ability of a ProSe-enabled
UE to discover ProSe-enabled UEs served by the E-UTRAN of other PLMNs.

The VPLMN shall be able to turn on or off the ability for all the
inbound roamers from a specific PLMN to be discovered using ProSe
Discovery.

When a ProSe-enabled UE is roaming in a VPLMN, its HPLMN shall be able
to authorise the ProSe-enabled UE to discover and independently be
discoverable by other ProSe-enabled UEs via settings which may be
different from those for the non-roaming case.

The network shall be able to authorise ProSe Discovery preferences (e.g.
discover and/or be discoverable) requested by third-party applications.

The network shall be able to store information of third-party
applications necessary for performing security and charging functions.

9.5 Security and Authorization Requirements for Indirect 3GPP Communication
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The 3GPP network shall be able to ensure that the end-to-end
confidentiality and integrity of data and signalling between an Evolved
ProSe Remote UE and 3GPP core network when the Evolved ProSe Remote UE
accesses the 3GPP network via an Indirect 3GPP Communication comparable
with when the Evolved ProSe Remote UE accesses the 3GPP network via a
direct 3GPP communication.

The 3GPP network shall be able to support regional or national
regulatory requirements (e.g. lawful interception, PWS) for a UE
independently of whether the UE accesses the 3GPP network via a direct
3GPP communication or an Indirect 3GPP Communication.

Based on the HPLMN operator preference, the 3GPP network shall be able
to authorize the ability of an Evolved ProSe Remote UE to access the
3GPP network via an Indirect 3GPP Communication.

NOTE: Separate authorization should be possible for home and roaming
use.

Based on the HPLMN operator preference, the 3GPP network shall be able
to authorize the ability of a UE (Evolved ProSe UE-to-Network Relay) to
relay another UE (Evolved ProSe Remote UE), separately for the HPLMN and
for roaming in VPLMNs.

9.6 Security and authorization requirements for streaming service
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Security measures shall be provided to protect access to streaming
service via different RATs or operators, e.g. the network sharing.

The 3GPP system shall be able to authorize the streaming delivery based
on a third party services policy.

10 Charging Aspects
===================

The Evolved Packet System shall support various charging models
including all those supported by the 3GPP system contained within
TS22.115 \[5\] .

Charging models that shall be supported by the Evolved Packet System
include (non-exhaustive list):

\- calling party pays

\- charging based on assured QoS

\- charging based on the transport

\- charging based on an event

\- charging based on content

\- charging adjustment (e.g. based on subscription bands)

\- alternate party charging

The Evolved Packet System shall also be able to support introduction of
new charging schemes including online and offline schemes, and charging
schemes for the multi-access system environment

Charging mechanisms of the Evolved Packet System shall provide
(non-exhaustive list):

\- Cost effective Control and Charging of IP Flows

\- Perform online charging

\- Support differentiated charging including zero rating of the bearer
and event charging

\- Awareness of subscriber identity, time-of-day, roaming status, QoS,
Service input etc

######## Annex A (informative): Requirements for further study

A.1 Management of access networks
---------------------------------

The Evolved Packet System shall be able to allow for self-managing
technologies (e.g. Plug-and-Play) for dynamically adding and removing
non-3GPP defined access networks.\
Such self-managing technologies shall take into account the Evolved
Packet System and access network policies.

E.g. depending on such policies it shall be possible to for the 3GPP
system operator to request encryption of user traffic that is
transmitted over the access network.

Note 1: The non-3GPP access network needs to have defined interworking
with 3GPP.

An example could be a WLAN (operated by some WLAN operator) that can, if
needed, automatically be connected to a PLMN. This would enable the PLMN
operator to provide additional access resources on a dynamic basis and
to provide service to more customers (e.g. at mass events).

Note 2: The degree of automation provided for network attachment is yet
to be determined, but is intended to simplify (or completely automate)
administration procedures.

A.2 Use cases for Fixed Mobile Convergence
------------------------------------------

A family has purchased a family subscription plan that is independent of
access (e.g. fixed or wireless) and location (e.g. both when at home and
away from home). The subscription contains at least the following
components:

-   Internet access: Operator specific service such as firewall and
    content filtering (parental control) independent of access for
    selected devices within the family. The service should be available
    at home, within the home mobile network and when roaming to a
    visited mobile network.

-   Voice/Multimedia: QoS and mobility between home WLAN and LTE wide
    area

-   Charging schemas connected to access type, preference and location

-   Video: Premium Video on Demand Service incl. guaranteed bandwidth
    and QoS regardless of access network.

**Description**

**Use case 1: Internet access with Parental control and personal
firewall**

The kids leave their house and take a bus to their grandparents\' house.

The operator specific services, like parental control and personal
firewall, are invoked for specific users and terminals from both fixed
network and from mobile network; this allows the kids to get the same
service and filtering inside the home, in the bus going to grandparents
and at the grandparents. In this use case the grandparents have a
separate service provider than the family but the services will still be
provided by the service provider where the family has a subscription.

**Use case 2: Voice/Multimedia and Charging**

The father travels home after work while talking on the phone with his
colleague.

The ongoing Voice/Multimedia call between the father and his colleague
is maintained while switching over between LTE Wide area and residential
fixed broadband WLAN network. Once the call is switched over to WLAN
charging for home-based access is applied. Bandwidth and QoS is
maintained for the duration of the call to guarantee the same service
delivery.

**Use case 3: Video**

The kids in the backseat of the car are watching an Internet TV show on
their laptop using LTE while driving home from the grandparent\'s house.

The TV show is sent from an Internet TV provider. Once home the terminal
detects indoor WLAN coverage where the subscriber has a WLAN Residential
Gateway connected to his Fixed Broadband network. The user or the
terminal automatically may select to switch the IP connection to the
wireline broadband connection and enable the user to resume watching the
same TV show on the same laptop, possibly with a better quality picture
as allowed by the available bandwidth, user-specific policy, network
policy and QoS setting.

**Use case 4: H(e)NB/Femtocell**

**A subscriber desires to improve coverage and access speed for their
3GPP device in their home. They purchase and install a small eNodeB
(Femtocell AP) device for their home which attaches to the home LAN and
establishes a connection back to the subscriber\'s mobile service
provider network. The mobile network provider coordinates with the
broadband access provider to deliver proper bandwidth and QoS to support
a good QoE for calls and data sessions made within the home that access
services from the mobile network. The Femtocell also allows some types
of data traffic to be shared with the home LAN, including traffic for
Internet applications. Local traffic can be discerned and accounted for
differently than traffic that is carried on the mobile network.**

**Use case 5: Application Mobility**

**A subscriber is in a multimedia call on their mobile device, and then
wishes to change the device they are using to a fixed network attached
device (e.g. Set Top Box / TV). The multimedia call is handed over from
the mobile network to the fixed network after the subscriber chooses to
transfer the multimedia call to a STB / TV. Bandwidth and QoS is
maintained for the large screen experience to be meaningful. Accounting
and settlement is supported among the application and network service
providers, and reflects the changes to the access technology and
required bandwidth.**

**Use case 6: Common Quota**

A Common Quota (CQ) can be assigned for both fixed and mobile accesses
for a limited time period for a defined set of subscriptions. During
each session the network elements monitor the CQ which may be consumed
by one or more devices over either the wireless or fixed networks.

When a defined percentage of the CQ and/or all the CQ has been consumed,
one or more subscribers in the defined set can be notified of the event
(e.g. via SMS and/or email).

When the CQ has been consumed the access to the services is blocked.

**Use case 7: Video On Demand Service**

Video On Demand (VoD) service is provided to the subscriber via the Set
Top Box to the TV or to the PC. A user orders a VoD service interacting
with the VoD infrastructure, which sends a resource request to the
network. The user may also request mid-session requests triggering the
increase/decrease of network resources. The requests will be accepted or
rejected according to the available network resources.

**Use case 8: Broadband Access Wholesale**

In Broadband network the wholesale scenario is quite important as it may
be required by the regulation, known as unbundling (access, connectivity
and services). For example the operator of the broadband access network
lease/sell transport of the connection through its own network from the
user to the buyer / leased network. So in the wholesale scenario the
renting operator has the end-to-end Service responsibility to the
customer and is viewed as the \"Retailer\" of the service or
application. While the leasing network operator has the responsibility
for the access network and for the connectivity.

######## Annex B (Normative): Void 

######## Annex B1 (Informative): Interworking between Mobile Operators and Data Application Providers

This Annex provides various scenarios and use cases applicable for
interworking between mobile operators and data applications.

B1.1 Scenarios
--------------

Figure 1 shows the non-roaming scenario where the mobile operator owns
the EPS as well as application layer entities. Access and IP
connectivity is provided by the mobile operator. Application platforms,
also provided by the mobile operator, shown in the figure connect to the
core network directly. Application platforms could be application
servers (e.g. Video on Demand Server, PSS Server, MTC Server, etc.).
Applications developed using APIs (e.g. REST, GSMA OneAPI) and resident
on the API Gateway are connected to the operator core network via the
API Gateway. The dashed lines between Operator CN and IMS as well as API
Gateway are already specified.

Figure 1: Operator owned non-roaming scenario

Figure 2 provides the non-roaming scenario where the mobile operator
does not own all the application layer entities. Access and IP
connectivity is provided by the mobile operator. The 3rd party
Application Platforms in this figure could be application servers (e.g.
Video on Demand Server, PSS Server, MTC Server, etc.) or could be 3rd
party software development platforms. The horizontal line represents the
demarcation between the mobile operator domain and the 3rd party
application provider domain. The mobile operator and 3rd party
application providers may have agreements.

B1.2 Use cases
--------------

### B1.2.1 Use cases for owned / collaborated scenarios.

**Pre-conditions**

A data application provider X develops an application customized for
streaming high definition movies to the mobile end user over 3GPP
access.

The data application provider X develops this application specifically
for a mobile network operator (MNO) Y. The data application provider X
hosts this application and establishes agreements with a mobile network
operator (MNO) Y to pilot the service. Authentication and charging are
provided by the MNO Y. The data application provider X can collaborate
with other MNOs as well.

Alice has subscribed to a 3GPP device and video services from the MNO Y.

**Use case 1: Authentication and Authorization**

Alice gets onto a train for 4-hour long ride to a neighboring country.
She turns on her device and looks at the movie catalog. She decides to
view a movie and selects the movie offered by the data application
provider X and watches it without worrying about the radio access
network she is using and any additional login/password procedures.

**Use case 2: Allocation of resources and other policy interactions**

All along the MNO Y manages the resources and the QoS needed for high
definition movie streaming to Alice. On the train, Alice gets distracted
by the scenery and misses a few scenes. She rewinds and views the
missing scenes.

**Use case 3: Simultaneous interactions with multiple application
providers**

Alice comes across an interesting gadget in the movie and decides to
pause on that scene and get a higher resolution closeup view. The close
up view prompts an advertisement to pop up for the gadget. Based on this
advertisement, Alice purchases the gadget. She is given the choice of
paying immediately or being charged on her MNO monthly bill. She decides
to charge to her MNO bill.

**Use case 4: Roaming**

Alice continues watching the movie and the train crosses the country
border. She starts roaming into another MNO Z, which has roaming
agreement with MNO Y. The movie quality is unaltered in the process of
roaming.

**Use case 5: Charging**

She gets a bill from the MNO at the end of the month which includes the
price for the movie she watched on the train and the gadget she
purchased.
