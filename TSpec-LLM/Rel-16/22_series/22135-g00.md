4 Description
=============

4.1 Description of multicall
----------------------------

The Multicall supplementary service enables a mobile subscriber to have
several simultaneous CS calls, each call using its own dedicated bearer.

Only one CS bearer can used for speech at any one times.

A speech call is one of TS11 (Telephony), TS12 (Emergency Calls), and
TS61 (Alternate speech/fax). If the bearer capability information is not
available, e.g. the call is originated/transited by a PSTN, the basic
service cannot be deduced and the network shall, for multicall purposes,
handle the call as telephony.

A held call shall be regarded as using the bearer used while the call
was active.

NOTE: The 3GPP protocol architecture allows several parallel CS calls,
the limitation being that there is only one traffic channel in GERAN,
which the different CS calls share. This is facilitated by e.g. the Call
Waiting, Call Hold, Call Transfer and Multiparty Supplementary Services.
Call configurations related to supplementary services are not considered
as Multicall. See clause 7 for interaction.

It shall be possible for each CS call to use a dedicated bearer of
independent traffic and performance characteristics. It shall be
possible to release each active CS call independently of any other CS
call.

4.2 Applicability to telecommunication services
-----------------------------------------------

The applicability of this Supplementary Service is defined in 3GPP TS
22.004.

5 Functional requirements
=========================

5.1 Provision
-------------

Multicall is provided by prior arrangement with the service provider.

Multicall shall be provisioned for all Basic Services (BS) subscribed to
and to which it is applicable, i.e. not to any subset of these BS.

When the Multicall supplementary service is provisioned the maximum
number of simultaneous CS beares available to the subscriber
(N**~br~**\_SB) shall be defined as part of the subscription. The value
for N**~br~**\_SB shall in the range from 2 up to 7.

5.2 Withdrawal
--------------

It shall be possible to withdraw the Multicall supplementary service
subscription on request of the subscriber or for administrative reasons.

5.3 Registration
----------------

The user shall be able to modify the maximum number of CS bearers
available (N**~br~**\_User) within the limitations set by the service
provider. (N**~br~**\_SB).

If the subscriber attempts to register a value for N**~br~**\_User that
is higher than the value of N**~br~**\_SB, the request shall be rejected
and the subscriber shall be informed on the unsuccessful outcome on the
request.

5.4 Erasure
-----------

Data related to the Multicall supplementary service shall be erased by
the service provider as a result of withdrawal.

5.5 Activation
--------------

The Multicall supplementary service shall be activated by the service
provider as a result of provision.

5.6 Deactivation
----------------

The Multicall supplementary service shall be deactivated by the service
provider as a result of withdrawal.

5.7 Invocation
--------------

The Multicall supplementary service shall be invoked by the system when
at least one call is in progress and another call with a dedicated
bearer is to be set up. The Multicall service applies to mobile
originating and mobile terminating calls.

5.8 Interrogation
-----------------

The user shall be able to interrogate the network for the values of
N**~br~**\_User, N**~br~**\_SB and N**~br~**\_SN.

5.9 Call related procedures
---------------------------

### 5.9.1 Terminating CS call

The indication of a terminating CS call to the mobile terminal will be
done by the Multicall supplementary service until either the maximum
number of bearer (N~br~) or the maximum number of CS mobile terminating
calls (N**~cs\_~MT**) has been reached.

If the maximum number of terminating calls (N~cs~\_MT) has been reached,
and additional terminating call shall be reject without any indication
to the subscriber.

If the maximum number of bearers (N**~br~**) has been reached an
additional terminating call will be only indicated to the user if the
user has the Call Waiting supplementary service active, see chapter
7.4.2 for interactions with Call Waiting.

If N**~br~** and N~cs~\_MT havenot been reached, a terminating call is
indicated to the user and she may react in the following way:

a\) Accept the terminating call:

\- The user/user applications shall have the possibility to allocate a
new bearer for the terminating call.

\- If the user has the Call Hold SS active, the user shall have the
possibility to reuse/share an already established bearer (e.g. release
existing calls or put an speech on hold and accept the terminating
call).

b\) Rejecting the terminating call:

\- If the user rejects the terminating call the call shall be released
in a normal way.

c\) Ignore the incoming call:

> \- If the user ignores the indication of the terminating call (i.e.
> neither accepts nor rejects it ), the normal call handling shall
> apply, e.g. after the Alerting Timer expires the call will be
> released.

If there is a terminating speech call attempt and an ongoing speech call
(active or held), the terminating call shall not be indicated to user by
the Multicall service. The Call waiting call SS shall be invoked if
applicable, see chapter 7.4.2 for interactions with Call Waiting SS.

The user can have possibility to reuse/share a bearer only when she is
provisioned for Call Hold SS. See subclause 7.4.1 for interaction with
Call Hold SS.

### 5.9.2 Originating CS call

If neither N~br~ nor N~cs~\_MO have not been reached and the user wants
to establish a new originating CS call she may act in the following way:

a)  allocate a new bearer for the originating call;

b)  reuse/share an already established bearer (e.g. to put an speech on
    hold and set-up a new call).

The user can have possibility to reuse/share a bearer only when she is
provisioned for Call Hold SS. See subclause 7.4.1 for interaction with
Call Hold SS. The mobile terminal shall not originate a speech call
requesting a new bearer when there is already an active speech call.

5.10 Charging requirements
--------------------------

Each of the calls using a dedicated bearer shall be charged
individually.

Allocation of a dedicated bearer shall be visible in the charging data.

6 Exceptional procedures or unsuccessful outcome
================================================

6.1 Exceptional operation or unsuccessful outcome
-------------------------------------------------

The number of simultaneous CS bearers supported by the system may vary
in different regions. For instance, after handover the number of
simultaneous bearers available to the served subscriber may be lower
than the number of already established bearers. Such events shall
trigger changes to individual calls in any multicall scenario.

The handover requirements for multicall are specified in 3GPP TS 22.129
\[6\].

6.2 Registration
----------------

If the system cannot accept a registration request, the served mobile
subscriber shall receive a notification that Multicall registration was
not successful. Possible causes are:

\- service not subscribed to;

-   N**~br~**\_User \> N~**br**\_~SB;

-   insufficient information.

6.3 Erasure
-----------

No exceptional operation identified.

6.4 Activation
--------------

No exceptional operation identified.

6.5 Deactivation
----------------

No exceptional operation identified.

6.6 Invocation
--------------

If the served subscriber attempts to set up a new call with a dedicated
bearer while the maximum number of bearers available to the subscriber
(N**~br~**) has been reached, the call attempt shall be rejected by
normal procedures, indicating that no more bearers are available.

6.7 Interrogation
-----------------

When a mobile subscriber who is not provided with the Multicall
supplementary service interrogates the service data of the Multicall
supplementary service, she shall be notified that she is not subscribed
to the service.

6.8 Roaming in non-supporting networks
--------------------------------------

Roaming into networks not supporting the Multicall supplementary service
shall be possible. The served subscriber will not have any access to the
Multicall supplementary service and the system should behave
accordingly.

When the served subscriber performs any procedure related to Multicall
service as described in the clauses above while roaming in a
non-supporting network, she shall be notified that the service is not
available.

7 Interaction with other services
=================================

7.1 Line Identification
-----------------------

### 7.1.1 Calling Line Identification Presentation (CLIP)

No impact, i.e. CLIP shall be provided with all calls.

### 7.1.2 Calling Line Identification Restriction (CLIR)

No impact, i.e. CLIR shall be provided with all calls.

### 7.1.3 Connected Line Identification Presentation (COLP)

No impact, i.e. COLP shall be provided with all calls.

### 7.1.4 Connected Line Identification Restriction (COLR)

No impact, i.e. COLR shall be provided with all calls.

7.2 Call Forwarding
-------------------

### 7.2.1 Call Forwarding Unconditional (CFU)

No impact.

### 7.2.2 Call Forwarding on Busy (CFB)

No impact.

NOTE: CFB shall be invoked when the network detects a NDUB condition.
The maximum number of bearers available to the subscriber (N**~br~**)
affects the NDUB condition. For the NDUB definition specific for
Multicall, see annex A.

> This means that for the case of N**~br~** = 1, the system behaviour
> shall be the same as for a subscriber who is not provided with the
> Multicall service.

### 7.2.3 Call Forwarding on No Reply (CFNRy)

No impact.

### 7.2.4 Call Forwarding on Not Reachable (CFNRc)

No impact.

7.3 Call Completion
-------------------

### 7.3.1 Call Hold (CH)

No impact, i.e. it shall be possible to put an established speech call
on hold.

Irrespective of whether the maximum number of CS bearers (N**~br~**) is
reached or not, and a terminating call is indicated to the user, she
shall be able to accept the terminating call by applying the Call Hold
service to an active speech call. By that she makes the bearer of the
held call available to the new call.

NOTE 1: This means that for the case of N**~br~** = 1, the system
behaviour shall be the same as for a subscriber who is not provided with
the Multicall service.

NOTE 2: There is no change to the maximum number of held calls allowed
for the Multicall supplementary service. The maximum number of held
calls is still 1 per a subscriber.

### 7.3.2 Call Waiting (CW)

When the subscriber has at least one ongoing call and a new terminating
call is speech; then Call Waiting shall be invoked if:

1)  there is an active speech call and Call Waiting is active and
    operative for speech or;

2)  there is a held speech call, with no active call on the same bearer,
    and Call Waiting is active and operative for speech or;

3)  there is a held speech call, with an active non-speech call on the
    same bearer, and Call Waiting is active and operative for that
    non-speech basic service or;

4)  there are no speech calls (including a call on hold), the maximum
    number of bearers (N**~br~**) has been reached and Call Waiting is
    active and operative for at least one of the basic services
    currently in use.

When the subscriber has at least one ongoing call and a new terminating
call is not speech; then Call Waiting shall be invoked if the maximum
number of bearers (N**~br~**) has been reached and Call Waiting is
active and operative for at least one of the basic services currently in
use.

NOTE: There is no change to the maximum number of waiting calls allowed
for the Multicall service. The maximum number of waiting calls is still
1 per a subscriber.

7.4 Multi Party (MPTY)
----------------------

No Impact.

The number of MPTY member may be limited by N~cs~\_MO, N~cs~\_MT and
N~cs~.

7.5 Closed User Group (CUG)
---------------------------

No impact.

7.6 Advice of Charge (AoC)
--------------------------

The subscriber shall receive the AoC indication individually for each CS
call.

For the AoCC service, the ACM (Accumulated Call Meter as defined in TS
22.024) shall reckon the sum of the charge generated by all simultaneous
CS calls.

7.7 Call Barring
----------------

No impact.

### 7.7.1 Barring of all outgoing calls

No impact.

### 7.7.2 Barring of outgoing international calls

No impact.

### 7.7.3 Barring of outgoing international calls except those directed to the HPLMN country

No impact.

### 7.7.4 Barring of all incoming calls

No impact.

### 7.7.5 Barring of incoming calls when roaming

No impact.

7.8 Explicit Call Transfer (ECT)
--------------------------------

No impact.

7.9 Completion of Call to Busy Subscriber (CCBS)
------------------------------------------------

The definition of the IDLE state of subscriber A and destination B is
not modified, i.e. a subscriber is considered to be IDLE when all the
bearers (calls) for her have been released.

A subscriber to whom CCBS can be invoked shall be regarded as NDUB under
the specific NDUB condition for Multicall (See Annex A).

7.10 Multiple Subscriber Profile (MSP)
--------------------------------------

No impact. The Multicall supplementary service shall be provisioned on a
per subscriber basis. Nbr\_SN, Nbr\_SB, and Nbr\_user shall apply over
all profiles.

7.11 Calling Name Presentation (CNAP)
-------------------------------------

No impact.

7.12 User-to-User Signalling (UUS)
----------------------------------

No Impact

7.13 enhanced Multi-Level Precedence and Pre-emption service (eMLPP)
--------------------------------------------------------------------

No impact.

7.14 Call Deflection (CD)
-------------------------

No impact.

8 Interaction with other network features and services
======================================================

8.1 CAMEL
---------

No impact.

8.2 IST
-------

No impact.

8.3 ODB
-------

No impact.

8.4 Emergency Calls
-------------------

The network shall handle emergency call at first priority. When a user
originates an emergency call, the network shall behave as follows:

-   The network, which supports Multicall, shall accept the emergency
    call within the serving network capability regardless of Multicall
    subscription limitation to the user.

-   The MS shall ensure that an emergency call setup request is
    acceptable to a serving network which does not support multicall, if
    necessary by releasing one or more existing call.

######## Annex A (normative): Busy definition

NDUB (Network Determined User Busy) occurs when:

1.  The maximum number of mobile terminating calls (N**~cs~\_MT**) has
    been reached (NOTE 1).

2.  The maximum number of bearers (N**~br~**) has been reached and the
    maximum number of waiting calls has been reached (NOTE 2, NOTE3).

NOTE 1: This can occur even if bearers are still available, e.g. when
the MS is engaged in MPTY SS. If the maximum number of mobile
terminating calls (N~cs~\_MT) has been reached, the Call Waiting SS
cannot be invoked.

NOTE 2: If Call Waiting is provisioned and activated, and when the
maximum number of bearers has been reached the Call Waiting SS can be
invoked. This case is not regarded as NDUB. See subclause 7.3.2 for
interaction with Call Waiting SS.

NOTE 3: According to the speech bearer number limitation, the incoming
speech call shall be regarded as encountering NDUB when the MS is
engaged in a speech call (including a held call) and Call Waiting SS is
not provisioned and activated for the user, irrespective of the further
availability of bearers for the user. For the condition under which Call
Waiting SS shall be invoked in this case, see subclause 7.3.2.

For User Determined User Busy (UDUB) condition see TS 22.001 Annex C.

######## Annex B (informative): Cross Phase Compatibility

This section details the cross phase compatibility requirements relating
to the service requirements in this document.

NOTE: When a change is introduced which affects the 3GPP specifications,
it is said to be \'backward compatible\' if existing equipment can
continue to operate and perform correctly with equipment that conforms
to the new implementation.

B.1 Compatibility With Existing Standards
=========================================

Where the service and operational requirements in this document relate
to core network functionality, compatibility is required.

Multicall mechanisms are not applicable for GERAN.

B.2 Compatibility With Future Releases
======================================

It is envisaged that 3GPP standards will evolve in future releleases,
for example with the addition of new service requirements. The standards
which define the technical implementation should be developed in such a
way that it is practical to add the requirements in this section in a
backward compatible manner.

Following chapters include requirements that are foreseen for future
release.

B.2.1 Multicall configuration
-----------------------------

When having one active CS call and one held call on the same bearer. It
shall be possible to create a new CS bearer and to move one of the calls
to the new bearer, resulting both calls being active within the limits
set by the operator/user and within the capability of the terminal. See
figure 2: Split of bearer.

When having two calls (multicall) on the separate bearers. It shall be
possible to join both calls to one of the two bearers, put the one of
the calls to hold and to release unused CS bearer. It shall be possible
to select which call to put on hold. See figure 2: Combination of
bearers. *(Note: there is no clear end-user service requirement for this
feature at time being)*.

NOTE: Due to that only speech calls can be put on hold, so one of the
two active Cs calls has to be a speech call.

Figure 2: Illustration for split of bearer and combination of bearers

B.2.2 Several simultaneous speech calls / bearers
-------------------------------------------------

A Key requirements for multicall is to allow several simultaneous CS
calls with dedicated bearers. The most important usage scenario is to
allow several CS data bearers to be bind at application level resulting
to higher than 64kbits/s data rates. Another important feature is to
allow simultaneous speech and data calls.

It\'s been proposed that the multicall feature could be introduced in a
phased manner; meaning that in the first phase, i.e. 3GPP release 99
does only support one active speech call at a time. However, Call
control should not prohibit a complete set of multiple speech bearer
services in future releases and UTRAN shall be designed in a flexible
way to support multiple speech bearers. The specific NDUB definition for
speech call shall be removed when multiple speech call is supported. At
this release , Supplementary Services Call Waiting, Multiparty and Call
Hold are used to offer simultaneous speech calls to user.

N~**cs**~ may be extended in further releases.

If multiple simultaneous speech calls are supported in the future then
the Call Hold service may be used to reconfigure the number of bearers
supporting speech calls if required during handover. e.g. in the case of
handover to GERAN where only one speech call can be active at a time.
This requirement is dependent on the user subscribing to Call Hold.

B.2.3 CCBS
----------

At this release CCBS no enhancements for CCBS is required.

In the future releases the definition of IDLE state of subscriber A and
destination B should be modified in away that the IDLE state is reach
even if there are active CS calls but the maximum limit of CS calls is
not reached.
