Introduction
============

The present document addresses a challenging class of vertical
applications, namely cyber-physical control applications, which require
very high levels of communication service availability, and some of them
also require very low end-to-end latencies.

Real-time Ethernet is one of the established wireline communication
technologies for cyber-physical control applications, and this
specification identifies requirements that 5G systems must meet to
support real-time Ethernet.

The present document provides new Stage 1 requirements based on the
input from relevant stakeholders of the respective vertical domains.

1 Scope
=======

The present document provides Stage 1 normative service requirements for
5G systems, in particular service requirements for cyber-physical
control applications in vertical domains. In the context of the present
document, cyber-physical systems are to be understood as systems that
include engineered, interacting networks of physical and computational
components; control applications are to be understood as applications
that control physical processes.

Communication services supporting cyber-physical control applications
need to be ultra-reliable and, in some cases, the end-to-end latency
must be very low. Communication for cyber-physical control applications
supports operation in various vertical domains, for instance industrial
automation and energy automation.

The aspects addressed in the present document include:

\- end-to-end service performance requirements and network performance
requirements related to these end-to-end service performance
requirements;

\- support for LAN-type services specific to industrial/high performance
use cases. Related Ethernet functionalities include, for example, those
in IEEE 802.1Qbv.

4.1 Introduction
----------------

For the purpose of this document, a vertical domain is a particular
industry or group of enterprises in which similar products or services
are developed, produced, and provided. Automation refers to the control
of processes, devices, or systems in vertical domains by automatic
means. The main control functions of automated control systems include
taking measurements, comparing results, computing any detected or
anticipated errors, and correcting the process to avoid future errors.
These functions are performed by sensors, transmitters, controllers, and
actuators.

In the context of this document, cyber-physical systems are referred to
as systems that include engineered, interacting networks of physical and
computational components. Cyber-physical control applications are to be
understood as applications that control physical processes.
Cyber-physical control applications in automation follow certain
activity patterns, which are open-loop control, closed-loop control,
sequence control, and batch control (see Clause 4.2).

Communication services supporting cyber-physical control applications
need to be ultra-reliable, dependable with a high communication service
availability, and often require low or (in some cases) very low
end-to-end latency.

Communication in automation in vertical domains follows certain
communication patterns. The most well-known is periodic deterministic
communication, others are aperiodic deterministic communication and
non-deterministic communication (see Clause 4.3).

Communication for cyber-physical control applications supports operation
in various vertical domains, for instance industrial automation and
energy automation. This document addresses service requirements for
cyber-physical control applications and supporting communication
services from the vertical domains of factories of the future (smart
manufacturing), electric power distribution, and central power
generation. Service requirements for cyber-physical control applications
and supporting communication services for rail-bound mass transit are
addressed in TS 22.289 \[23\].

4.2 Activity patterns in automation
-----------------------------------

**Open-loop control:** The salient aspect of open-loop control is the
lack of feedback from the output to the control; when providing commands
to an actuator, it is assumed that the output of the influenced process
is predetermined and within an acceptable range. This kind of control
loop works if the influences of the environment on process and actuator
are negligible. Also, this kind of control is applied in case unwanted
output can be tolerated \[8\].

**Closed-loop control:** Closed-loop control enables the manipulation of
processes even if the environment influences the process or the
performance of the actuator changes over time. This type of control is
realised by sensing the process output and by feeding these measurements
back into a controller \[8\].

**Sequence control:** Sequence control may either step through a fixed
sequence or employ logic that performs different actions based on
various system states and system input \[8\]. Sequence control can be
seen as an extension of both open-loop and closed-loop control, but
instead of achieving only one output instance, an entire sequence of
output instances can be produced \[9\].

**Batch control:** Batch processes lead to the production of finite
quantities of material (batches) by subjecting input materials to a
defined order of processing actions by use of one or more pieces of
equipment \[10\].

4.3 Communication attributes
----------------------------

**Communication in automation can be characterised by two main
attributes: periodicity and determinism.**

Periodicity means that a transmission interval is repeated. For example,
a transmission occurs every 15 ms. Reasons for a periodical transmission
can be the periodic update of a position or the repeated monitoring of a
characteristic parameter. Most periodic intervals in communication for
automation are rather short. The transmission is started once and
continuous unless a stop command is provided.

An aperiodic transmission is, for example, a transmission which is
triggered instantaneously by an event, i.e., events are the trigger of
the transmission. Events are defined by the control system or by the
user. Example events are:

\- Process events: events that come from the process when thresholds are
exceeded or fallen below, e.g., temperature, pressure, level, etc.

\- Diagnostic events: events that indicate malfunctions of an automation
device or module, e.g., power supply defective; short circuit; too high
temperature; etc.

\- Maintenance events: events based on information that indicates
necessary maintenance work to prevent the failure of an automation
device.

Most events, and especially alarms, are confirmed. In this context,
alarms are messages that inform a controller or operator that an event
has occurred, e.g., an equipment malfunction, process deviation, or
other abnormal condition requiring a response. The receipt of the alarm
is acknowledged usually within a short time period by the application
that received the alarm. If no acknowledgment is received from the
target application after a preset time, the so-called monitoring time,
the alarm is sent again after a preset time or some failure response
action is started.

Determinism refers to whether the delay between transmission of a
message and receipt of the message at the destination address is stable
(within bounds). Usually, communication is called deterministic if it is
bounded by a given threshold for the latency/transmission time. **In
case of a periodic transmission, the variation of the interval is
bounded.**

4.4 Control systems and related communication patterns
------------------------------------------------------

**There are preferences in the mapping between the type of control and
the communication pattern. Open-loop control is characterised by one or
many messages sent to an actuator. These can be sent in a periodic or an
aperiodic pattern. However, the communication means used need to be
deterministic since typically an activity response from the receiver
and/or the receiving application is expected.**

**Closed-loop control produces both periodic and aperiodic communication
patterns. Closed-loop control is often used for the control of
continuous processes with tight time-control limits, e.g., the control
of a printing press. In this case, one typically relies on periodic
communication patterns. Note that in both the aperiodic and periodic
case, the communication needs to be deterministic.**

**Logging of device states, measurements, etc. for maintenance purposes
and such typically entails aperiodic communication patterns. In case the
transmitted logging information can be time-stamped by the respective
function, determinism is often not mandatory.**

In practice, vertical communication networks serve a large number of
applications exhibiting a wide range of communication requirements. In
order to facilitate efficient modelling of the communication network
during engineering and for reducing the complexity of network
optimisation, traffic classes or communication patterns have been
identified \[6\]. There are three typical traffic classes or
communication patterns in industrial environments \[6\], i.e.,

\- deterministic periodic communication: periodic communication with
stringent requirements on timeliness of the transmission.

\- deterministic aperiodic communication: communication without a preset
sending time. Typical activity patterns for which this kind of
communication is suitable are event-driven actions.

\- non-deterministic communication: subsumes all other types of traffic,
including periodic non-real time and aperiodic non-real time traffic.
Periodicity is irrelevant in case the communication is not
time-critical.

Some communication services exhibit traffic patterns that cannot be
assigned to one of the above communication patterns exclusively (mixed
traffic).

4.5 Implications for 5G systems
-------------------------------

In order to be suitable for automation in vertical domains, 5G systems
need to be dependable and flexible to meet specific KPIs to serve
specific applications and use cases. They need to come with the system
properties of reliability, availability, maintainability, safety, and
integrity. What particular requirements each property needs to meet
depends on the particularities of the domain and the use case. The
requirements in this document provide various sets of performance
criteria that need to be met to satisfactorily support different use
cases of cyber-physical control applications used by various vertical
markets.

5 Performance requirements
==========================

5.1 Overview
------------

There are two fundamental perspectives concerning dependable
communication in 5G systems: the end-to-end perspective of the
communication services and the network perspective (see Figure 5.1-1).

![](media/image3.wmf){width="6.691666666666666in" height="2.0in"}

Figure 5.1-1: Network perspective of 5G system

The Communication Service in Figure 5.1-1 may be implemented as a
logical communication link between a UE on one side and a network server
on the other side, or between a UE on one side and a UE on the other
side.

In some cases, a local approach (e.g. network edge) is preferred for the
communication service on the network side in order to reduce the
latency, to increase communication service availability, or to keep
sensitive data in a non-public network on the factory site.

The tables in Clauses 5.2 through 5.5 below provide sets of
requirements, where periodicity and determinism are critical to meeting
cyber-physical control application needs in various vertical scenarios.
While many use cases have similar KPI values, the important distinction
is that in order to meet the needs of different verticals and different
uses, the 5G system will need to be sufficiently flexible to allow
deployment configurations that can meet the different sets of KPIs
specific to each use.

Communication service availability is considered an important service
performance requirement for cyber-physical applications, especially for
applications with deterministic traffic. The communication service
availability depends on the latency and reliability (in the context of
network layer packet transmissions, as defined in TS 22.261 \[2\]) of
the logical communication link, as well as the survival time of the
cyber-physical application (see Annex C.3 for further details on these
relations).

The communication service reliability requirements also depend on the
operation characteristics of the corresponding cyber-physical
applications. Typically, the communication services critical for the
automation application also come with stringent communication service
reliability requirements. Note that the communication service
reliability requirement has no direct relationship with the
communication service availability requirement.

The \"\# of UEs\" in the tables in clauses 5.2 to 5.5 is intended to
give an indication of the UE density that would need to be served within
a given service area (e.g. to understand the kind of capacity demand it
puts on the 5G system).

Clock synchronisation is needed in many \"vertical\" use cases. The
requirements and tables in Clause 5.6 provide specific criteria for
managing time sensitive communications in an industrial environment.

High accuracy positioning is becoming essential for Factories of the
Future. The reason for this is that tracking of mobile devices as well
as mobile assets is becoming increasingly important in improving
processes and increasing flexibility in industrial environments, Clause
5.7 provides positioning requirements for horizontal accuracy,
availability, heading, latency and UE speed in an industrial use case
scenario.

An example of the relationship between reliability (in the context of
network layer packet transmissions, as defined in TS 22.261 \[2\]),
survival time, and communication service availability of a logical
communication link is illustrated in the following Table 5.1-1.

Table 5.1-1: Example of relationship between reliability (as defined in
TS 22.261) and communication service availability when the survival time
is equal to the transfer interval.

5.2 Periodic deterministic communication
----------------------------------------

Periodic deterministic communication is periodic with stringent
requirements on timeliness and availability of the communication
service. A transmission occurs every transfer interval. A description of
periodic deterministic communication can be found in Clauses 4.3 and
4.4. Additional information on the underlying use cases of the sets of
requirements in Table 5.2-1 can be found in Annex A. Further information
on characteristic parameters and influence quantities used in Table
5.2-1 can be found in Annex C.

The 5G system shall be able to provide periodic deterministic
communication with the service performance requirements for individual
logical communication links that realise the communication services
reported in Table 5.2-1.

5.6 Clock synchronisation requirements
--------------------------------------

### 5.6.0 Description

Clock synchronicity, or time synchronization precision, is defined
between a sync master and a sync device. The requirement on the
synchronicity budget for the 5G system is the time error contribution
between ingress and egress of the 5G system on the path of clock
synchronization messages.

### 5.6.1 Clock synchronisation service level requirements

The 5G system shall support a mechanism to process and transmit
IEEE1588v2 / Precision Time Protocol messages to support 3^rd^-party
applications which use this protocol.

The 5G system shall support a mechanism to synchronise the user-specific
time clock of UEs with a global clock.

The 5G system shall support a mechanism to synchronize the user-specific
time clock of UEs with a working clock.

The 5G system shall support two types of synchronization clocks, the
global time domain and the working clock domains.

The 5G system shall support networks with up to 32 working clock
domains.

NOTE 1: The domain number (synchronization domain identifier) is defined
with one octet in IEEE 802.1AS \[22\].

The 5G system shall support at least 2 simultaneous working clock
domains on a UE.

The synchronicity budget for the 5G system within the global time domain
shall not exceed 900 ns .

NOTE 2: The global time domain requires in general a precision of 1 µs
between the sync master and any device of the clock domain. Some use
cases require only a precision of ≤ 100 µs for the global time domain if
a working clock domain with precision of ≤ 1 µs is available.

NOTE 3: (void)

The synchronicity budget for the 5G system within a working clock domain
shall not exceed 900 ns .

NOTE 4: The working clock domains require a precision of ≤ 1 µs between
the sync master and any device of the clock domain.

NOTE 5: Different working clock domains are independent and can have
different precision.

The 5G system shall provide a media dependent interface for one or
multiple 802.1AS sync domains \[22\].

The 5G system shall provide an interface to the 5G sync domain which can
be used by applications to derive their working clock domain or global
time domain (Reference Clock Model).

The 5G system shall provide an interface at the UE to determine and to
configure the precision and time scale of the working clock domain.

5.7 Positioning performance requirements
----------------------------------------

High accuracy positioning is becoming essential for Factories of the
Future. The reason for this is that tracking of mobile devices as well
as mobile assets is becoming increasingly important in improving
processes and increasing flexibility in industrial environments.

Table 5.7-1 below lists typical scenarios and the corresponding high
positioning requirements for horizontal accuracy, availability, heading,
latency, and UE speed.

NOTE: The column on \"Corresponding Positioning Service Level in TS
22.261\" maps the scenarios listed in Table 5.7-1 to the service levels
defined in TS 22.261 \[2\] which also include corresponding vertical
accuracy requirements.

6 Ethernet applications 
=======================

6.1 Description

This section lists the requirements applicable to the 5G system for
supporting cyber-physical applications using Ethernet.

For requirements pertaining to common, fundamental Ethernet transport
requirements, and any requirements necessary to support the 5G LAN-type
service, see Clause 6.24 in TS 22.261 \[2\].

6.2 Requirements

For infrastructure dedicated to high performance Ethernet applications,
the 3GPP system shall support clock synchronisation defined by IEEE
802.1AS across 5G-based Ethernet links with PDU-session type Ethernet.

For infrastructure dedicated to high performance Ethernet applications,
the 3GPP system shall support clock synchronisation defined by IEEE
802.1AS across 5G-based Ethernet links and other ethernet transports
such as wired and optical (EPON.)

For infrastructure dedicated to high performance Ethernet applications,
the accuracy of clock synchronisation should be better than 1µs.

For infrastructure dedicated to high performance Ethernet applications,
the 3GPP system shall support enhancements for time-sensitive networking
as defined by IEEE 802.1Q, e.g. time-aware scheduling with absolute
cyclic time boundaries defined by IEEE 802.1Qbv \[19\], for 5G-based
Ethernet links with PDU sessions type Ethernet.

For infrastructure dedicated to high performance Ethernet applications,
absolute cyclic time boundaries shall be configurable for flows in DL
direction and UL direction.

For infrastructure dedicated to high performance Ethernet applications,
the 3GPP system shall support coexistence of hard-RT traffic following a
time-aware schedule and lower priority traffic. The lower priority
traffic cannot have a performance degrading impact on the hard-RT
traffic.

The Ethernet transport service shall support routing based on
information extracted from the Ethernet header information created based
on 802.1Qbv.

A.2 Factories of the Future
===========================

A.2.1 Overview
--------------

The manufacturing industry is currently subject to a fundamental change,
which is often referred to as the \"Fourth Industrial Revolution\" or
simply \"Industry 4.0\" \[15\]. The main goals of Industry 4.0 are―among
others―the improvement of flexibility, versatility, resource efficiency,
cost efficiency, worker support, and quality of industrial production
and logistics. These improvements are important for addressing the needs
of increasingly volatile and globalised markets. A major enabler for all
this are cyber-physical production systems based on a ubiquitous and
powerful connectivity, communication, and computing infrastructure. The
infrastructure interconnects people, machines, products, and all kinds
of other devices in a flexible, secure and consistent manner. Several
different application areas can be distinguished:

**1) Factory automation:** Factory automation deals with the automated
control, monitoring and optimisation of processes and workflows within a
factory. This includes aspects like closed-loop control applications
(e.g., based on programmable logic or motion controllers) and robotics,
as well as aspects of computer-integrated manufacturing. Factory
automation generally represents a key enabler for industrial mass
production with high quality and cost-efficiency. Corresponding
applications are often characterised by highest requirements on the
underlying communication infrastructure, especially in terms of
communication service availability, determinism, and latency. In the
Factories of the Future, static sequential production systems will be
more and more replaced by novel modular production systems offering a
high flexibility and versatility. This involves many increasingly mobile
production assets, for which powerful wireless communication and
localisation services are required.

**2) Process automation:** Process automation refers to the control of
production and handling of substances like chemicals, food & beverage,
pulp, etc. Process automation improves the efficiency of production
processes, energy consumption, and safety of the facilities. Sensors
measuring process values, such as pressures or temperatures, are working
in closed loops via centralised and decentralised controllers. In turn,
the controllers interact with actuators, e.g., valves, pumps, heaters.
Also, monitoring of attributes such as the filling levels of tanks,
quality of material, or environmental data are important, as well as
safety warnings or plant shut downs. Workers in the plant are supported
by mobile devices. A process automation facility may range from a few
100 m² to several km², and the facility may be geographically
distributed. Depending on the size, a production plant may have several
10 000 measurement points and actuators. Autarkic device power supply
for years is needed in order to stay flexible and to keep the total
costs of ownership low.

**3) HMIs and production IT:** Human-machine interfaces (HMIs) include
all sorts of devices for the interaction between people and production
facilities, such as panels attached to a machine or production line, but
also standard IT devices, such as laptops, tablet PCs, smartphones, etc.
In addition, augmented- and virtual-reality applications are expected to
play an increasingly important role in future.

4\) **Logistics and warehousing**: Organisation and control of the flow
and storage of materials and goods in the context of industrial
production. In this respect, intra-logistics is dealing with logistics
within a certain property (e.g., within a factory), for example by
ensuring the uninterrupted supply of raw materials on the shop floor
level using automated guided vehicles (AGVs), fork lifts, etc. This is
to be seen in contrast to logistics between different sites. Warehousing
particularly refers to the storage of materials and goods, which is also
getting more and more automated, for example based on conveyors, cranes
and automated storage and retrieval systems.

5\) **Monitoring and maintenance**: Monitoring of certain processes
and/or assets in the context of industrial production without an
immediate impact on the processes themselves (in contrast to a typical
closed-loop control system in factory automation, for example). This
particularly includes applications such as condition monitoring and
predictive maintenance based on sensor data, but also big data analytics
for optimising future parameter sets of a certain process, for instance.
For these use cases, the data acquisition process is typically not
latency-critical.

For each of these application areas, a multitude of potential use cases
exists, some of which are outlined in the following subclauses. These
use cases can be mapped to the given application areas (see Table
A.2.1-1).

### A.2.2.1 Motion control

A motion control system is responsible for controlling moving and/or
rotating parts of machines in a well-defined manner, for example in
printing machines, machine tools or packaging machines.

A schematic representation of a motion control system is depicted in
Figure A.2.2.1-1. A motion controller periodically sends desired set
points to one or several actuators (e.g., a linear actuator or a drive)
which thereupon perform a corresponding action on one or several
processes (in this case usually a movement or rotation of a certain
component). At the same time, sensors determine the current state of the
process(es), e.g. the current position and/or rotation of one or
multiple components, and send the actual values back to the motion
controller. This is done in a strictly cyclic and deterministic manner,
such that during one application cycle the motion controller sends
updated set points to all actuators, and all sensors send their actual
values back to the motion controller. Nowadays, typically Industrial
Ethernet technologies are used for motion control systems.

*Use cases one to three*

Characteristic parameters and influence quantities for a communication
service supporting the cyclic interaction described above.

### A.2.2.2 Control-to-control communication

Control-to-control communication, i.e., the communication between
different industrial controllers is already used today for different use
cases, such as:

\- large machines (e.g., newspaper printing machines), where several
controls are used to cluster machine functions, which need to
communicate with each other; these controls typically need to be
synchronised and exchange real-time data;

\- individual machines that are used for fulfilling a common task (e.g.,
machines in an assembly line) often need to communicate, for example for
controlling and coordinating the handover of work pieces from one
machine to another.

Typically, a control-to-control network has no fixed configuration of
certain controls that need to be present. The control nodes present in
the network often vary with the status of machines and the manufacturing
plant. Therefore, hot-plugging support for different control nodes is
important and often used.

*Use case one*

Control-to-control communication between different motion (control)
subsystems, as addressed in Subclause A.2.2.1. An exemplary application
for this are large printing machines, where it is not possible or
desired to control all actuators and sensors by one motion controller
only.

### A.2.2.3 Mobile robots

Mobile robots and mobile platforms, such as automated guided vehicles,
have numerous applications in industrial and intra-logistics
environments and will play an increasingly important role in the Factory
of the Future. A mobile robot essentially is a programmable machine able
to execute multiple operations, following programmed paths to fulfil a
large variety of tasks. This means, a mobile robot can perform
activities like assistance in work steps and transport of goods,
materials and other objects. Mobile robot systems are characterised by a
maximum flexibility in mobility relative to the environment, with a
certain level of autonomy and perception ability, i.e., they can sense
and react with their environment.

Autonomous guided vehicles are a sub-group of mobile robots. These
vehicles are driverless and used for moving materials efficiently within
a facility. A detailed overview of the state of the art of
autonomous-guided-vehicle systems is provided elsewhere in the
literature \[16\].

Mobile robots are monitored and controlled from a guidance control
system. Radio-controlled guidance control is necessary to get up-to-date
process information, to avoid collisions between mobile robots, to
assign driving jobs to the mobile robots, and to manage the traffic of
mobile robots. The mobile robots are track-guided by the infrastructure
with markers or wires in the floor or guided by own surround sensors,
like cameras and laser scanners.

Mobile robot systems can be divided in operation in indoor, outdoor and
both indoor and outdoor areas. These environmental conditions have an
impact on the requirements of the communication system, e.g., the
handover process, to guarantee the required cycle times.

### A.2.3.1 Closed-loop control

In the closed-loop control use case for process automation, several
sensors are installed in a plant and each sensor performs continuous
measurements. The measurement data are transported to a controller,
which takes decision to set actuators. The latency and determinism in
this use case are crucial. This use case has very stringent requirements
in terms of latency and service availability. The required service area
is usually bigger than for motion control use cases. Interaction with
the public network (e.g., service continuity, roaming) is not required.

*Use case one*

Several sensors are installed in a plant and each sensor performs
continuous measurements. The measurement data are transported to a
controller, which takes decision to set actuators.

### A.2.3.2 Process monitoring

For process monitoring in the area of process automation, several
sensors are installed in the plant to give insight into process or
environmental conditions or inventory of material. The data are
transported to displays for observation and/or to databases for
registration and trending. The operation for this use case can be in a
wide service area, and interaction with the public network (e.g.,
service continuity, roaming) may be required.

*Use case one*

Several sensors are installed in the plant for providing insight into
process or environmental conditions, or into inventory of material. The
messages are transported to displays for observation and/or to databases
for registration and trending.

### A.2.3.3 Plant asset management

To keep a plant running, it is essential that the assets, such as pumps,
valves, heaters, instruments, etc., are maintained. Timely recognition
of any degradation and continuous self-diagnosis of components are used
to support and plan maintenance. Remote software updates enhance and
adapt the components to changing conditions and advances in

technology. The positioning requirements for this use case are mainly
based on the typical scenarios where IoT devices (e.g., sensors) are
giving insight into process or environmental conditions or inventory of
material, asset management or maintenance. The operation for this use
case can be in a wide service area, and interaction with the public
network (e.g., service continuity, roaming) may be required.

A.2.4 Human machine interfaces
------------------------------

### A.2.4.1 Mobile control panels

Control panels are crucial devices for the interaction between people
and production machinery as well as for the interaction with moving
devices. These panels are mainly used for configuring, monitoring,
debugging, controlling and maintaining machines, robots, cranes or
complete production lines. In addition to that, (safety) control panels
are typically equipped with an emergency stop button and an enabling
device, which an operator can use in case of a safety event in order to
avoid damage to humans or machinery. When the emergency stop button is
pushed, the controlled equipment immediately comes to a safe stationary
position. Likewise, if a machine, robot, etc. is operated in the
so-called special 'enabling device mode', the operator manually keeps
the enabling device switch in a special stationary position. If the
operator pushes this switch too much or releases it, the controlled
equipment immediately comes to a safe stationary position as well. This
way, it can be ensured that the hand(s) of the operator are on the panel
(and not under a moulding press, for example), and that the operator
does―for instance―not suffer from any electric shock or the like. A
common use case for this 'enabling device mode' is the installation,
testing or maintenance of a machine, during which other safety
mechanisms (such as a safety fence) are deactivated.

Due to the criticality of these safety functions, safety control panels
currently have mostly a wire-bound connection to the equipment they
control. In consequence, there tend to be many such panels for the many
machines and production units that typically can be found in a factory.
With an ultra-reliable low-latency wireless link, it would be possible
to connect such mobile control panels with safety functions wirelessly.
This would lead to a higher usability and would allow for the flexible
and easy re-use of panels for controlling different machines.

The cycle times of the control application depends on the
process/machinery/equipment whose safety has to be ensured. For a
fast-moving robot, for example, end-to-end latencies are lower than for
slowly moving linear actuators.

### A.2.4.2 Augmented reality

It is envisioned that in future smart factories and production
facilities, people will continue to play an important and substantial
role. However, due to the envisaged high flexibility and versatility of
the Factories of the Future, shop floor workers should be optimally
supported in getting quickly prepared for new tasks and activities and
in ensuring smooth operations in an efficient and ergonomic manner. To
this end, augmented reality may play a crucial role, for example for the
following applications:

\- monitoring of processes and production flows;

\- step-by-step instructions for specific tasks, for example in manual
assembly workplaces;

\- ad hoc support from a remote expert, for example for maintenance or
service tasks.

In this respect, especially head-mounted augmented-reality devices with
see-through display are very attractive since they allow for a maximum
degree of ergonomics, flexibility and mobility and leave the hands of
workers free for other tasks. However, if such augmented-reality devices
are worn for a longer period (e.g., one work shift), these devices have
to be lightweight and highly energy-efficient while at the same time
they should not become very warm. A very promising approach is to
offload complex (e.g., video) processing tasks to the network (e.g., an
edge cloud) and to reduce the augmented-reality head-mounted device's
functionality. This has the additional benefit that the
augmented-reality application may have easy access to different context
information (e.g., information about the environment, production
machinery, the current link state, etc.) if executed in the network.

A.2.5 Monitoring and maintenance
--------------------------------

### A.2.5.1 Remote access and maintenance

In factories of the future, there are needs to perform remote access and
maintenance to devices and entities, for instance, by remote control
centres. The devices and entities might be installed at geographically
distributed locations. These devices typically have firmware/software
which needs to be updated occasionally. Maintenance information also
needs to be collected and distributed from/to these devices
periodically. The devices can be both stationary and mobile. Device
maintenance may happen in parallel to the actual production process and
other communication services performed at the device side without any
negative impact on these production communication services.

A.4 Electric-power distribution
===============================

A.4.1 Overview
--------------

The energy sector is currently subject to a fundamental change, which is
caused by the evolution towards renewable energy, i.e. an increasing
number of power plants based on solar and wind power. These changes lead
to bi-directional electricity flows and increased dynamics of the power
system. New sensors and actuators are being deployed in the power system
to efficiently monitor and control the volatile conditions of the grid,
requiring real-time information exchange \[11\]\[12\].

The emerging electric-power distribution grid is also referred to as
Smart Grid. The smartness enhances insight into both the grid as a power
network and the grid as a system of systems. Enhanced insight improves
controllability and predictability, both of which drive improved
operation and economic performance and both of which are prerequisites
for the sustainable and scalable integration of renewables into the grid
and the potential transition to new grid architectures. Smart Grid
benefits spread across a broad spectrum but generally include
improvements in: power reliability and quality; grid resiliency; power
usage optimisation; operational insights; renewable integration; insight
into energy usage; and safety and security.

Overviews of (future) electric-power distribution can be found elsewhere
in the literature \[13\]\[14\].

A.4.2 Primary frequency control
-------------------------------

Primary frequency control is among the most challenging and demanding
control applications in the utility sector. A primary frequency control
system is responsible for controlling the energy supply injected and
withheld to ensure that the frequency is not deviating more than 0,02 %
from the nominal value (e.g., 50 Hz in Europe). Frequency control is
based on having sensors for measuring the features in all parts of the
network at all points where energy generation or storage units are
connected to the grid. At these points, electronic power converters,
also known as inverters, are equipped with communication units to send
measurement values to other points in the grid such as a frequency
control unit, or receive control commands to inject more, or less,
energy into the local network.

With the widespread deployment of local generation units, i.e. solar
power units, or wind turbines, hundreds of thousands of such units, and
their inverters, may have to be connected in a larger power distribution
network.

Primary frequency control is carried out in one of three ways:

1\) Centralised control, all data analysis and corrective actions are
determined by a central frequency control unit.

2\) Decentralised control, the automatic routine frequency control is
performed by the individual local inverter based on local frequency
values. Statistics and other information is communicated to the central

A.4.3 Distributed voltage control
---------------------------------

In the evolution towards 100 % renewable electric power production, the
objective of voltage control is to balance the voltage in future low
voltage distribution grids connecting local loads and prosumers, as well
as energy storage facilities. The aim is to stabilise the voltage as
locally as possible, so that decisions and control commands can be
issued as quickly as possible. Distributed voltage control is a
challenging and demanding control application. Consumer devices rely on
having stable voltage levels to operate successfully. When future energy
networks rely on thousands of local energy generation units relying
mostly on solar and wind power, then it is crucial to stabilise the
voltage levels in all segments of the distribution grid. Inverters, or
electronic power converters, measure the voltage and power and change
the amount of power injected into the grid, and they connect and
disconnect end-points from the distribution network.

Distributed control means that the automated voltage control shall be
performed by the local voltage control units based on local *and
neighbouring* voltage and impedance values. Statistics and other
information shall be communicated to the central distribution management
system, though.

A.4.4 Distributed automated switching for isolation and service restoration
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

A power distribution grid fault is a stressful situation. There are
self-healing solutions for automated switching, fault isolation and,
service restoration. Furthermore, these solutions are ideally suited to
handle outages that affect critical power consumers, such as industrial
plants or data centres. Supply interruptions must be fixed within less
than a second for critical power consumers. Automated solutions are able
to restore power supply within a few hundred milliseconds.

![](media/image6.png){width="6.5in" height="4.021527777777778in"}

Figure A.4.4-1: Depiction of a distribution ring and a failure (flash of
lighting)

The FLISR (Fault Location, Isolation & Service Restoration) solution
consists of switch controller devices which are especially designed for
feeder automation applications that support the self-healing of power
distribution grids with overhead lines. They serve as control units for
reclosers and disconnectors in overhead line distribution grids.

The system is designed for using fully distributed, independent
automated devices. The logic resides in each individual feeder
automation controller located at the poles in the feeder level. Each
feeder section has a controller device. Using peer-to-peer communication
among the controller devices, the system operates autonomously without
the need of a regional controller or control centre. However, all
self-healing steps carried out will be reported immediately to the
control centre to keep the grid status up-to-date. The controllers
conduct self-healing of the distribution line in typically 500 ms by
isolating the faults.

Peer-to-peer communication via IEC 61850 GOOSE (Generic Object Oriented
Substation Event) messages provides data as fast as possible (Layer 2
multicast message). They are sent periodically (in steady state, with
changing interval time in fault case) by each controller to several or
all other controllers of the same feeder and are not acknowledged.

The data rate per controller is low in steady state, but GOOSE bursts
with high data rate do occur, especially during fault situations. GOOSE
messages are sent by several or all controller units of the feeder
nearly at the same point in time during the fault location, isolation
and service restoration procedure with a low end-to-end latency.

automated switching for isolation and service restoration

######## Annex B (informative): Communication service errors

B.1 Introduction
================

IEC 61784-3-3 describes fundamental communication errors that can be
identified for applications with functional safety requirements \[3\].
The description of these communication errors is adjusted to field
buses. These errors may however also occur in other communication
systems. As explained in Annex C, some of these errors are also used for
the assessment of communication services that do not support
safety-critical applications.

B.2 Corruption
==============

Messages may be corrupted due to errors within an application, due to
errors on the transmission medium, or due to message interference.

NOTE 1: Message error during transfer is a normal event for any standard
communication system; such events are detected with high probability at
receivers by use of, for instance, hash functions.

NOTE 2: Most communication systems include protocols for recovery from
transmission errors, so these messages will not be classed as \'loss\'
until recovery or repetition procedures have failed or are not used.

NOTE 3: If the recovery or repetition procedures take longer than a
specified deadline, a message is classed as \"unacceptable delay\". See
also the discussion in Clause C.3.

NOTE 4: In the very low probability event that multiple errors result in
a new message with correct message structure (for example addressing,
length, hash function such as CRC, etc.), the message will be accepted
and processed further. Evaluations based on a message sequence number or
a time stamp can result in fault classifications such as unintended
repetition, incorrect sequence, unacceptable delay, insertion \[3\].

B.3 Unintended repetition
=========================

Due to an error, fault, or interference, not updated messages are
accidentally repeated.

NOTE 1: Repetition by the sender is a common procedure when an expected
acknowledgment/response is not received from a target station, or when a
receiver detects a missing message and asks for it to be resent.

In some cases, the lack of response can be detected, and the message
repeated with minimal delay and no loss of sequence, in other cases the
repetition occurs later and arrives out of sequence with other messages.

NOTE 2: Some field buses use redundancy to send the same message
multiple times or via multiple alternate routes to increase the
probability of good reception \[3\].

B.4 Incorrect sequence
======================

Due to an error, fault, or interference, the predefined sequence (for
example natural numbers, time references) associated with messages from
a source is incorrect.

NOTE 1: Field bus systems can contain elements that store messages (for
example FIFOs in switches, bridges, routers) or use protocols that can
alter the sequence (for example, by allowing messages with high priority
to overtake those with lower priority).

NOTE 2: When multiple sequences are active, such as transmission of
messages from different source entities or reports relating to different
object types, these sequences are monitored separately, and errors can
be reported for each sequence \[3\].

B.5 Loss
========

Due to an error, fault or interference, a message or acknowledgment is
not received \[3\].

B.6 Unacceptable deviation from target end-to-end latency
=========================================================

Messages may be delayed or advanced beyond their permitted arrival time
window. Causes for this behaviour include errors in the transmission
medium, congested transmission lines, interference, and applications
sending messages in such a manner that communication services are
delayed or denied.

Message errors can be recovered in the following ways using scheduled or
cyclic scans, for instance, in field buses:

a\) immediate repetition;

b\) repetition using spare time at the end of the cycle;

c\) treating the message as lost and waiting for the next cycle to
receive the next value.

In case of (a), all subsequent messages in that cycle are slightly
delayed, while in case (b) only the resent message is delayed.

Cases (a) and (b) are often not classed as an unacceptable deviation
from the target end-to-end latency.

Case (c) would be classed as an unacceptable delay for cyclic,
distributed automation functions, unless the cycle repetition interval
is short enough to ensure that delays between cycles are not significant
and that the next cyclic value can be accepted as a replacement for the
missed previous value before the survival time expiries (see Clause C.3)
\[3\].

B.7 Masquerade
==============

Due to a fault or interference, a message is inserted that relates to an
apparently valid source entity, so a non-safety related message may be
received by a safety-related participant, which then treats it as safety
related.

NOTE: Communication systems used for safety-related applications can use
additional checks to detect masquerade, such as authorised source
identities and pass-phrases or cryptography \[3\].

B.8 Insertion
=============

Due to a fault or interference, a message is received that relates to an
unexpected or unknown source entity.

NOTE: These messages are additional to the expected message stream, and
because they do not have expected sources, they cannot be classified as
correct, unintended repetition, or incorrect sequence \[3\].

B.9 Addressing
==============

Due to a fault or interference, a safety-related message is delivered to
the incorrect safety related participant, which then treats reception as
correct \[3\].

######## Annex C (informative): Characterising communication services

C.1 Modelling of communication in automation
============================================

C.1.1 Area of consideration
---------------------------

For our discussion of communication in automation we apply a definition
of the area of consideration for industrial radio communication that is
found elsewhere in the literature \[4\]. This definition is illustrated
in Figure C.1.1-1.

![](media/image7.wmf){width="5.865972222222222in"
height="3.3694444444444445in"}

NOTE: Blue objects: communication system; other objects: automation
application system.

Figure C.1.1-1: Abstract diagram of the area of consideration for
industrial radio communication

Here, a distributed automation application system is depicted. This
system includes a distributed automation application, which is the
aggregation of several automation functions. These can be functions in
sensors, measurement devices, drives, switches, I/O devices, encoders
etc. all of these functions contribute toward the control of physical
objects. Field bus systems, industrial Ethernet systems, or wireless
communication systems can be used for connecting the distributed
functions. The essential function of these communication systems is the
distribution of messages among the distributed automation functions. For
cyber-physical control applications, the dependability of the entire
communication system and/or of its devices or its links is essential.
Communication functions are realised by the respective hardware and
software implementation.

In order for the automation application system to operate, messages need
to be exchanged between spatially distributed application functions. For
that process, messages are exchanged at an interface between the
automation application system and the communication system. This
interface is termed the reference interface. Required and guaranteed
values for characteristic parameters, which describe the behavioural
properties of the radio communication system, as well as some influence
quantities refer to that interface.

The conditions that influence the behaviour of wireless communication
are framed by the communication requirements of the application (e.g.,
end-to-end latency), the characteristics of the communication system
(e.g., output power of a transmitter), and the transmission conditions
of the media (e.g., signal fluctuations caused by multipath
propagation).

General requirements from the application point of view for the time and
failure behaviour of a communication system are mostly related to an
end-to-end link. It is assumed in the present document that the
behaviour of the link is representative of the communication system as a
whole and of the entire scope of the application.

C.1.2 Logical link
------------------

### C.1.2.1 Nature and function

Starting with the general approach mentioned in Subclause C.1.1, the
logical link can be regarded as a possible asset within the area of
consideration (see Figure C.1.1-1). The conditions under which its
functions are to be performed are vital for the dependability of the
automation application system.

![](media/image8.wmf){width="6.690972222222222in"
height="3.6173611111111112in"}

Figure C.1.2.1-1: The concept of a logical link

This is the link between a logical end point in a source device and the
logical end point in a target device. Logical end points are elements of
the reference interface, which may group several logical end points
together.

The intended function of the logical link is the transmission of a
sequence of messages from a logical source end point to the correct
logical target end point. This is achieved by transforming each message
into a form that fosters error-free transmission. The transmission
process includes certain processes, for instance repetitions, in order
to fulfil the intended function. After transmission, the transported
package(s) is converted back into a message. The message is to be
available and correct at the target within a defined time. The sequence
of messages at the target is to be the same as the sequence at the
source.

The functional units, which are necessary to fulfil this function are
shown, in Figure C.1.2.1-1.

![](media/image9.wmf){width="6.275in" height="1.8208333333333333in"}

Figure C.1.2.1-2: The asset \"logical link\"

The required function can be impaired by various influences, which can
lead to communication errors. Such errors are described elsewhere in the
literature \[4\]\[5\]. A summary of these errors is provided in Annex A.
The occurrence of one of these errors influences the values of the
relevant dependability parameters of the logical link.

### C.1.2.2 Message transformation

The present document addresses both OSI-layer-3 (IP) and OSI-layer-2
communication. The model in Figure C.1.2-1 can be used for describing
both cases. The implementation of communication functions is split
between a higher communication layer (HCL) and a lower communication
layer (LCL). The partition of the layer for the two traffic options
discussed in the present document is provided in Table C.1.2.2-1. This
difference is of importance when discussing the implications of the
service performance requirements in Clause 5 and Annex A for the network
performance (see Clause C.5).

Table C.1.2.2-1: Partition into higher communication layer and lower
communication layer

  NOTE: In some vertical application, level 3 to 6 are not implemented.                                                        
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------

The messages to be transmitted for the intended function of a logical
link are defined by strings of characters with a certain semantic. Such
a character string is handed over as user data at the reference
interface for transmission. If the number of characters in a message is
too great for it to be transmitted as a unit, the message is divided for
transmission into several packets (fragmentation).

### C.1.2.3 Communication device

The communication devices---together with the physical link---determine
the function and thus the dependability of the logical link. The
function of the communication devices is the correct sending and correct
receipt of sequences of messages. The asset \"communication device\" is
depicted in Figure C.1.2.3-1.

![](media/image10.wmf){width="6.810416666666667in"
height="2.047222222222222in"}

Figure C.1.2.3-1: Asset \"communication device\"

### C.1.2.4 Communication system

The communication system as an asset represents a quantity of logical
links whose message transmissions are implemented by wireless devices
via one or more media. The communication system function to be provided
consists in transmitting messages for all the logical links in the
distributed application. This function is to be performed for a defined
period, the operating time of the automation application.

In an automation application system, it is paramount that requirements
pertaining to logical links are fulfilled. These requirements and the
conditions can be very different from one case and implementation to the
other. The functions (services and protocols) for individual logical
links can therefore also be different. Despite these differences, some
of the logical links share communication devices and media.

description of the communication service performance. The lists are
grouped according to whether the parameter stands for automation
characteristic parameters (Table C.2.2-1) or influence quantities (Table
C.2.3-1). The meaning of the columns and rows is explained after each
table.

NOTE 1: Not all parameters in Table C.2.2-1 and Table C.2.3-1 would be
used in a service call.

NOTE 2: Ingress and egress in this clause are in reference to the
communication service interface between the source application and the
communication service interface (ingress) and the communication service
and the target application (egress).

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------- --------------------------------------- ---------------------------------

**Parameter description**

*Communication service availability*

This parameter indicates if the communication system works as contracted
(\"available\"/\"unavailable\" state). The communication system is in
the \"available\" state as long as the availability criteria for
transmitted packets are met. The service is unavailable if the packets
received at the target are impaired and/or untimely (e.g. update time \>
stipulated maximum). If the survival time (see Table C.2.3-1) is larger
than zero, consecutive impairments and/or delays are ignored until the
respective time has expired.

For the mapping of communication service availability on network KPIs
such as packet error rate, it may be assumed that network equipment
failures do not happen or only with negligible probability. In this
case, only the unavailabilities caused by actual transmission errors
(e.g. lost packets, exceeded maximum end-to-end latency) will be
considered for the design of network KPIs of the 5G system.

*End-to-end latency*

This parameter indicates the time allotted to the communication system
for transmitting a message and the permitted timeliness.

*Communication service reliability*

Mean time between failures is one of the typical indicators for
communication service reliability. This parameter states the mean value
of how long the communication service is available before it becomes
unavailable. For instance, a mean time between failures of one month
indicates that a communication service runs error-free for one month on
average before an error/errors make the communication service
unavailable. Usually, an exponential distribution is assumed. This
means, there will be several failures where the time between two
subsequent errors is below the mean value (1 month in the example).

Communication service availability and communication service reliability
(mean time between failures) give an indication on the time between
failures and the length of the failures.

*Service bit rate*

*a) deterministic communication*

The target value indicates committed data rate in bit/s sought from the
communication service. This is the minimum data rate the communication
system guarantees to provide at any time, i.e. in this case target value
= user experienced data rate.

*b) non-deterministic communication*

The target value indicates the target data rate in bit/s. This is the
information rate the communication system aims at providing on average
during a given (moving) time window (unit: s). The user experienced data
rate the lower data rate threshold for any of the time windows.

*Update time*

Applicable only to periodic communication, the update time indicates the
time interval between any two consecutive messages delivered from the
egress (of the communication system) to the application.

**Traffic classes**

In practice, vertical communication networks serve applications
exhibiting a wide range of communication requirements. In order to
facilitate efficient modelling of the communication network during
engineering, and for reducing the complexity of network optimisation,
disjoint QoS sets have been identified. These sets are referred to as
traffic classes \[6\]. Typically, only three traffic classes are needed
in industrial environments \[6\], i.e.

\- deterministic periodic communication;

\- deterministic aperiodic communication; and

\- non-deterministic communication.

Deterministic periodic communication stands for periodic communication
with stringent requirements on timeliness of the transmission.

Deterministic aperiodic communication stands for communication without a
pre-set sending time. Typical activity patterns for which this kind of
communication is suitable are event-driven actions.

Non-deterministic communication subsumes all other types of traffic.
Periodic non-real time and aperiodic non-real time traffic are subsumed
by the non-deterministic traffic class, since periodicity is irrelevant
in case the communication is not time-critical.

**Usage of the parameters in Table C.2.2-1**

Control service request and response; monitoring service response and
indication.

**Parameter description**

*Burst*

The transmission of, for instance, program code and configuration data
may be handed to the 3GPP system as data burst. In this case, the
ingress data rate exceeds the capacity of the network, which implies
that some of the data has to be stored within the ingress node of the
communication system before it can be transmitted to the egress
interface(s). However, the data of a burst needs be transmitted
completely. This is in contrast to periodic data transmission, where new
messages overwrite old ones.

Typical metrices for bursts:

\- aperiodic data transmission: maximum user data length and minimum
transfer interval;

\- non-deterministic transmission: message length and line rate of the
service interface.

*Survival time*

The maximum survival time indicates the time period the communication
service may not meet the application\'s requirement before the
communication service is deemed to be in an unavailable state.

NOTE 1: The survival time indicates to the communication service the
time available to recover from failure. This parameter is thus tightly
related to maintainability \[7\].

*Transfer interval*

Applicable only to periodic communication, the transfer interval
indicates the time elapsed between any two consecutive messages
delivered by the automation application to the ingress of the
communication system.

*Message size*

The user data length indicates the (maximum) size of the user data
packet delivered from the application to the ingress of the
communication system and from the egress of the communication system to
the application. For periodic communication this parameter can be used
for calculating the requested user-experienced data rate. If this
parameter is not provided, the default is the maximum value supported by
the PDU type (e.g. Ethernet PDU: maximum frame length is 1522 octets, IP
PDU: maximum packet length is 65 535 octets).

C.3 Up time and up state vs. down state and down time
=====================================================

The assessment of periodic deterministic communication services is based
on the assessment of successful message transmission over a logical
communication link. Message transmission is either:

*- successful, if it is correctly and timely received, or*

*- unsuccessful, if it is incorrectly received, lost or untimely.*

Up time and down time can be derived from received messages. As far as
timely received messages are correct, the logical communication link
status is *up*. If a message loss or an incorrectly or untimely received
message is detected the logical communication link status is *down*. To
denote up and down states the terms "up time interval" and "down time
interval", or alternatively "*available"* and "*unavailable"* may be
used. An example of the relation between logical communication link
status, communication service status and application status is presented
in Figure C.3-1.

Figure C.3-1: Relation between logical communication link, communication
service and application statuses (example with lost messages)

The flow of events in Figure C.3-1 is as follows:

a\) The logical communication link is up and running (blue line is UP).
A source device starts sending periodic messages to a target device
(orange arrows), on which an automation function (application) is
running. The communication service is, from the point of view of the
target application, in an up state (violet line is UP) and so is the
application (green line is UP).

b\) The logical communication link status changes to down state if it no
longer can support end-to-end transmission of the source device\'s
messages to the target device in agreement with the negotiated
communication requirements. Once the application on the target device
senses the absence (or unsuccessful reception) of expected messages
(\"Deadline for expected message\" in Figure C.3-1), it will wait a
pre-set period before it considers the communication service to be
unavailable ; this is the so-called survival time. The survival time can
be expressed as

\- a period or,

\- especially with cyclic traffic, as maximum number of consecutive
incorrectly received or lost messages.

c\) If the survival time has been exceeded, both the communication
service and the application transition into a down state (violet and
green lines change to DOWN in Figure C.3-1). The application will
usually take corresponding actions for handling such situations of
unavailable communication services. For instance, it will commence an
emergency shutdown. Note that this does not imply that the target
application is \"shut off\"; rather it transitions into a pre-defined
state, e.g. a safe state. In the safe state, the target application
might still listen to incoming packets or may try to send messages to
the source application.

d\) Once the logical communication link status is in the up state again
(blue line in Figure C.3-1 changes to UP), the communication service
state as perceived by the target application will change to the up
state. The communication service is thus again perceived as available
(violet line changes to UP in Figure C.3-1). The state of the
application, however, depends on the counter measures taken by the
application. The application might stay in down state if it is in a safe
state due to an emergency shutdown. Or, the application may do a
recovery and change to up state again. The time needed for the
application to return to the up state after the communication service is
restored is shown as "Application recovery time" in Figure C.3-1.

The availability of the communication service is calculated using the
accumulated down time. For instance, in case the communication service
is expected to run for a time *T*, the unavailability *U* of the
communication service can be calculated as

![](media/image12.png){width="0.6805555555555556in"
height="0.3541666666666667in"}

Where Δ*t~i~* is the length of the *i*-th downtime interval of the
communication service within the time period *T.* The communication
service availability *A* can then be calculated as

*A = *1--*U.*

C.4 Timeliness as an attribute for timing accuracy
==================================================

C.4.1 Overview
--------------

There are several time parameters in dependability assessment. A
required value is specified for every time parameter. This value can be
a maximum, mean, modal, minimum etc. Typically, there is a deviation
from the desired value to the actual value. Jitter is often used to
characterise this variation. Since jitter generally is used for
characterising the behaviour of a measured parameter, for instance the
scatter of measured end-to-end latencies (\"the world as it is\"), it
can be quite confusing to use it for formulating service performance
requirements (\"the world as we want it to be\"). What is needed is a
concept and related parameters that allow for formulating and talking
about the end-to-end latency requirements in Clause 5 and Annex A.

The most important attribute is timeliness. Timeliness can be formulated
a permitted interval for the actual value of the time parameter.
Accuracy, earliness and lateness describe the allowed deviation from a
target value. Accuracy is the magnitude of deviation. It can be negative
(early) or positive (tardy).

C.4.2 Network latency requirement formulated by use of timeliness
-----------------------------------------------------------------

In 5G networks, the end-to-end latency KPI is a critical KPI in order to
ensure that the network can deliver the packet within a time limit
specified by an application: not too early and not too late.

In cyber-physical automation, the arrival time of a specific packet
should be strictly inside a prescribed time window. In other words, a
strict time boundary applies: \[minimum end-to-end latency, maximum
end-to-end latency\]. Otherwise, the transmission is erroneous. Although
most use cases that require timely delivery only specify the maximum
end-to-end latency, the minimum latency is also sometimes prescribed. In
the latter case, a communication error occurs if the packet is delivered
earlier than the minimum end-to-end latency. An example for a related
application is putting labels at a specific location on moving objects,
and the arrival of a message is interpreted as a trigger for this
action. In other words, the application does not keep its own time, but
interprets the message arrival as clock signal. Maximum and minimum
end-to-end latency alone do not disclose which value is preferred, i.e.
target value. The next three subclauses introduce concepts help with
relating maximum end-to-end latency, minimum end-to-end latency, and
target vale to each other.

C.4.3 Timeliness
----------------

Timeliness is described by a time interval (see Figure C.4.3-1). The
interval is restricted by a lower bound (*t*~LB~) and an upper bound
(*t*~UB~). This interval contains all values *t*~A~ that are within an
accepted \"distance\" to the target value *t*~R~.

![](media/image13.png){width="5.29375in" height="2.7805555555555554in"}

Figure C.4.3-1: Timeliness function

A message reception is considered in time, if it is received within the
timeliness interval. If it is received outside the timeliness interval,
the message reception is considered invalid. This is related to the
communication error \"unacceptable deviation from target end-to-end
latency\" (see Subclause B.6). In other words, maximum end-to-end
latency = *t*~UB~ and minimum end-to-end latency = *t*~LB~.

Timeliness is related to deviation (see Subclause C.4.4), the lower
bound *t*~LB~ is related to earliness (see Subclause C.4.5), and the
upper bound *t*~UB~ is related to lateness (see Subclause C.4.6).

C.4.4 Deviation
---------------

The term deviation describes the discrepancy between an actual value
(*t*~A~) and a target value (*t*~R~).

Deviation(*t*~A~) = *t*~A~ -- *t*~R~.

Figure C.4.4-1 shows two examples. The target value is 10 time units
(*t*~R~ = 10) in both cases. In the first case (blue) the actual value
measures 12 time units (*t*~A~ = 12). The difference of both amounts to
+2 time units, which means that the deviation is 2 time units
\[Accurracy(*t*~A~) = 2\]. The second case (purple) shows the actual
value as 9 time units (*t*~A~ = 9). The difference of both amounts to -1
time unit, which means that the deviation is --1 time units
\[Accuracy(*t*~A~) = --1\].

Figure C.4.4-1: Examples for accuracy values

Figure C.4.4-2 shows the deviation with respect to the target time (t).
The following applies:

Deviation(*t*) \< 0 for *t* \< *t*~R~; that is, the arrival is early.

Deviation(*t*) = 0 for *t* = *t*~R~; that is, the arrival is as desired,
i.e. on time.

Deviation(*t*) \> 0 for *t* \> *t*~R~; that is, the arrival is late (see
also C.4.6)

![](media/image15.png){width="3.573611111111111in"
height="2.520138888888889in"}

Figure C.4.4-2: Accuracy function

C.4.5 Earliness
---------------

Earliness describes how early the actual value is: earliness is greater
than 0 if the actual value is less than the target value (see Figure
C.4.5-1). The following applies:

Eearliness(*t*~A~) = *t*~R~ -- *t*~A~ = --Deviation(*t*~A~) for *t*~A~
\< *t*~R;~

Eearliness(*t*~A~) = 0 for *t*~A~ ≥ *t*~R~.

In an example, the target value is 10 time units (*t*~R~ = 10), and the
actual value is 7 time units (*t*~A~ = 7). The difference of both is 3
time units with respect to being early. That means that the earliness is
3 time units \[Eearliness(t~A~) = 3\].

![](media/image16.png){width="3.040277777777778in"
height="1.773611111111111in"}

Figure C.4.5-1: Earliness function

C.4.6 Lateness
--------------

Lateness describes how much greater the actual value is than the target
value: lateness is greater than 0 if the actual value is greater than
the desired value (see Figure C.4.6-1). The following applies:

L(*t*~A~) = 0 for *t*~A~ ≤ *t*~R;~

L(*t*~A~) = *t*~A~--t~R~ = Deviation(*t*~A~) for *t*~A~ \> *t*~R~.

In an example, the target value is 10 time units (*t*~R~ = 10), and the
actual value measures 14 time units (*t*~A~ = 14). The difference of
both is 4 time units with respect to being late. That means that the
lateness is 4 time units \[L(*t*~A~) = 4\].

![](media/image17.wmf){width="2.5131944444444443in" height="1.675in"}

Figure C.4.6-1: Lateness function

C.4.7 Conclusion
----------------

Using the concepts of earliness and lateness (see Subclauses C.4.5 and
C.4.6, respectively), the maximum and minimum end-to-end latency can be
rewritten as follows.

*Maximum end-to-end latency = target end-to-end latency + maximum
lateness;*

*Minimum end-to-end latency = target end-to-end latency -- maximum
earliness.*

C.5 Communication service terminology w.r.t. 5G network and vertical applications
=================================================================================

This section clarifies the wording and terminology with respect to
communication interfaces that are relevant for vertical applications.
Because the 3GPP network does not cover the complete ISO-OSI
communication stack, it is important to distinguish between

\- the vertical applications' point of view, and

\- the 3GPP network's point of view.

In this section, the relation between those two is clarified.

Figure C.5-1 shows a simplified version of the communication stack. The
PHY layer, the MAC layer and some parts of the IP layer are part of the
3GPP network. The layers that are part of the 3GPP network are referred
to as lower communication layers (LCL). The communication stack also
includes an application. The OSI layers related to providing data to the
application are referred to as the higher communication layers (HCL).
The interface between LCL and HCL is referred to as communication
service interface (CSIF).

For the assessment of the overall system performance, it is important to
differentiate between the 3GPP network's performance (i.e., including
only the LCL and measured at the CSIF) and the overall system
performance including the application layer (i.e., including both, the
LCL and the HCL). In Figure C.5-1, the orange arrow depicts the vertical
application's point of view. The blue arrows indicate two options to
measure the 3GPP network's performance, i.e., including and excluding
the IP layer.

Figure C.5-1: Network performance measurements at different
communication system interfaces (CSIF)

Figure C.5-2 illustrates how messages are transmitted from a source
application device (e.g., a programmable logic controller) to a target
application device (e.g. an industrial robot). The source application
function (AF) is executed in the source operating system (OS) and hands
over a message to the application layer interface of the source
communication device. In the higher communication layers (HCL), which
are not part of the 3GPP system, the data is processed. From the HCL the
data is transferred to the lower communication layers (LCL), which are
part of the 3GPP system. After transmission through the physical
communication channel and the LCL of the target communication device,
the data is passed to the HCL and lastly to the target application
device. Characteristic parameters with respect to time are defined in
Figure C.5-2.

From 3GPP system point of view:

\- Transfer interval of 5G system: Time between the arrival of two
pieces of data at the source CSIF.

\- End-to-end latency: Time measured from the point when a piece of data
received at the CSIF in the source communication device until the same
piece of data is passed to the CSIF in the target communication device.

From vertical application point of view:

\- Transfer interval of vertical application: Time between the
transmission of two successive pieces of data from the source
application.

\- Transmission time: Time measured from the point when a piece of data
is handed from the application layer interface of the source application
device, until the same piece of data is received at the application
layer interface of the target application device.

\- Update time: Time between the reception of two consecutive pieces of
data at the application layer interface to the target application
device.

If not stated otherwise, the terms \"end-to-end latency\" and \"transfer
interval\" refer to the 3GPP system / 5G network parameters in this
document.

######## Annex D (informative): 5G in industrial automation: different and multiple time domains for synchronization

D.1 Description
===============

The required synchronization precision is usually given as the maximum
absolute value of the time difference between sync master and any device
in the synchronisation domain (time domain or clock domain). A common
example is a synchronisation precision of ≤ 1 µs. This is equivalent to
± the precision value, so ±1 µs between sync master and any device in
the synchronisation domain, resulting in two times this value as maximum
absolute time difference between any two devices in the synchronisation
domain (2 µs in the example).

An industrial automation network generally consists of two distinct time
domains.

First is the *global time domain*. This is the time used for overall
synchronization in the system (e.g. the factory). It is used to align
operations and events chronologically. Industrial automation uses the
term *universal time domain* \[20\] for the global time domain described
in this document. Global time is known as a synonym for universal time
in industrial automation. Global time is called wall clock in certain
areas and standards.

The synchronization precision is typically ≤ 1µs \[20\]. In some areas,
a precision of ≤ 100 µs might be sufficient for the global time domain
if a working clock with precision of ≤ 1 µs is available. The assigned
timescale is usually the International Atomic Time (TAI, *temps atomique
international*), based on the precision time protocol (PTP) epoch
(starting from 1 January 1970 00:00:00 TAI) \[22\]. While there is
usually only one global time, multiple global time domains are possible.

Clock synchronization in the global time domain usually applies to all
UEs within the industrial facility in industrial automation. That is, a
global time domain covers usually the industrial facility.

Second is the *working clock domain*. Working clock domains are
constrained in size. They often consist of a single machine or a set of
neighbouring machines that physically collaborate. The restricted size
allows very precise time synchronization (≤1µs) with efficient network
components. Synchronisation to a working clock is used to align e.g.
production lines, production cells, or machines/functional units. In
these cases, the application synchronizes locally within the working
clock domains (Figure D.1-1), allowing precise synchronization with more
efficient components. A global time domain usually contains multiple
working clock domains. The starting point (epoch) is the start of the
working clock domain.

height="3.077777777777778in"}

Figure D.1-1: Global time domain and working clock domains

The assigned timescale of a working clock domain is arbitrary (timescale
ARB \[22\]). Therefore, different working clock domains may have
different timescales and different synchronisation accuracy and
precision. Robots, motion control applications, numeric control, and any
kind of clocked / isochronous application rely on the timescale of the
working clock domain to make sure that actions are precisely interwoven
as needed.

Clock synchronization in the working clock domain is constraint in size.
A specific working clock domain will contain only a subset of the UEs
within the industrial facility. Often, the UEs of the working clock
domain are connected to the same gNB. However, it is also possible that
a working clock domain contains multiple neighbouring gNBs. This depends
on the actual use case and its vertical application.

Devices may be part of multiple time domains leading to overlapping
working clock domains.

The required precision (usually ≤ 1 µs) is between the sync master and
any sync slaves (device) of the clock domain, both, global time domain
and working clock domain.

Clock domains might be called sync domains in certain areas and
standards.

D.2 Merging of working clock domains
====================================

One key issue of the integration of TSN and 5G wireless networks that
has to be handled is mobility. The integration of 5G wireless
communication into the industrial communication infrastructure allows
for mobility in the manufacturing process. This mobility enhances
flexibility in the manufacturing process, e.g. through adding certain
manufacturing capabilities on-demand by having a machine move to the
respective production line. This means that machines that are
synchronized to different working clock domains may need to interact
with each other.

The following scenario illustrates this. After the mobile machine has
arrived at the intended location and is stationary again, the two
interacting working clock domains have to be synchronized with each
other. Otherwise interaction might not be possible without interfering
with ongoing operations. An example is an autonomous mobile handling
robot adding parts to an assembly line. Without synchronization between
both, correct placement of the parts would be impossible.

However, it is not feasible to schedule these interactions beforehand.
Therefore, the interaction between different working clock domains
requires a concept for handling the communication. TSN provides already
mechanisms for this. The 5G systems and the UEs need to provide an
interface in order to exchange information of the clock domain.

Figure D.2-1: Working clock domain interactions \"Merge\" and
\"Separate\"

When members of different working clock domains interact, there are two
possible options (Figure D.2-1). Which option is used depends on the
application and its requirements.

\- Merge: The working clock domains merge into one. This option can be
used in applications where synchronization is critical, e.g. high
precision robots interacting with each other.

\- Separate: The members of the different working clock domains interact
while keeping their own separate time synchronizations. This option can
be used in applications where synchronization is non-critical, e.g. an
AGV collecting finished products from a production line.

D.3 Time synchronization with 5G networks
=========================================

For the time synchronization with 5G networks, we consider two possible
options.

The 5G system uses the 802.1AS time sync domains: In this case, the 5G
system provides a media dependent interface to the 802.1AS sync domain
\[21\], which the application can use to synchronize to the sync domain.
In the IEEE 802.1AS standard \[22\], a similar concept is detailed in
the MDSyncSend and MDSyncReceive structures.

The 5G system provides the working clock domains and global time domain:
In this case, the 5G system has to provide an interface which the
application can use to derive their working clock domain or global time
domain. A device can belong to multiple working clock domains. An
application can use each of these as the reference clock for
synchronization (reference clock model).

NOTE: The required precision (usually ≤ 1 µs) is between the sync master
and any sync slave (device) of the clock domain.
