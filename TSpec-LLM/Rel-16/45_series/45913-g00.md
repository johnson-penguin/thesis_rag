Introduction
============

The EGPRS2-B feature has been included into GERAN Rel-7 with the legacy
GMSK pulse shape. This pulse shape yields good performance and can be
used without any requirements on the operator network scenario.

Initial analysis have shown that in certain network scenarios, a
spectrally wider pulse shape can improve data throughput performance
further.

To obtain superior data throughput performance, investigation of a wider
pulse shape is needed, including the network scenarios that will benefit
from a wider pulse shape. Selection of either the legacy pulse shape or
the new pulse shape will be under operator control.

It is not clear to what degree the current spectral mask can be widened
without causing a detrimental impact on legacy mobile stations in these
networks. It is also not clear if a spectral mask relaxation is
dependent on the modulation transmitted or whether it can be assumed to
be applicable for all modulations. It is important to continue to
improve the GERAN system performance with new features, and as such it
is relevant that this topic is carefully and independently studied.

1 Scope
=======

The present document is an output of the 3GPP study item \"Optimized
Transmit Pulse Shape for Downlink EGPRS2-B\" (\"WIDER\") \[2\], the
objective of which is to optimise pulse shapes based on optimization
criteria to be agreed by TSG GERAN WG1, and provide an evaluation of the
optimized pulse shapes in a similar manner as was used in the SAIC
feasibility study TR 45.903 \[3\].

4 Objectives
============

4.1 Performance objectives
--------------------------

### 4.1.1 Data throughput improvements

The objective is to further enhance the data throughput of EGPRS2-B on
the downlink.

4.2 Compatibility objectives
----------------------------

### 4.2.1 Maintenance of voice quality

The introduction of the wide bandwidth pulse should not decrease voice
quality as perceived by the user.

The criteria for minimum call quality shall be:

1st Criterion: blocked calls \< 2 %

2nd Criterion: satisfied user criterion fulfilled:

• average call FER \< 1 % for at least 95 % users in case of network
scenarios WIDER-2 and WIDER-3 (see section 5.3);

• average call FER \< 2 % for at least 95 % users in case of network
scenarios WIDER-1 (see section 5.3).

### 4.2.2 Data throughput

The introduction of the wide bandwidth pulse shall increase overall
network throughput.

### 4.2.3 Implementation impacts to new Mobile Stations

The introduction of the wide bandwidth pulse should change MS hardware
as little as possible.

### 4.2.4 Implementation impacts to BSS

The introduction of the wide bandwidth pulse should change BSS hardware
as little as possible.

### 4.2.5 Impacts to network planning

Criteria for definition of minimum call quality performance for this
objective is defined in section 4.2.1.

The study shall take into consideration the usage of wide pulse shape at
the band edge, at the edge of an operator\'s band allocation and in
country border regions where no frequency coordination are in place.

The wide pulse is expected to fulfil the same adjacent channel
protection requirements as the linearised GMSK pulse at the 400 kHz
offset and higher (see Section 5.2.3).

When EGPRS2-B is used on a frequency which is adjacent (at a 200 kHz
offset) to a frequency which is uncoordinated (see above), then the
linearised GMSK pulse shall be used.

### 4.2.6 Compatibility with Multi-User Reusing-One-Slot (MUROS)

The feature Optimized Transmit Pulse Shape for Downlink EGPRS2-B (WIDER)
and the feature Multi-User Reusing-One-Slot (MUROS) will be studied
independently but that compatibility of both features will be
investigated after completion of the feasibility studies and before the
corresponding work items are agreed.

5 Study item pre-requisites
===========================

5.1 Introduction
----------------

Pre-requisites to the study are identified as follows:

• Preliminary boundary conditions for pulse shape optimisation, where
more than one set of boundary conditions may be considered in order to
derive a selection of pulse shape candidates.

• One or more network configurations for pulse shape evaluation. These
shall be representative of the most likely EGPRS2 deployment strategies.

• A legacy Rx filter working assumption.

5.2 Preliminary boundary conditions for pulse shape optimisation
----------------------------------------------------------------

### 5.2.1 Introduction

Boundary conditions are needed to define the scope of the optimisation.
The boundary conditions will also allow a pre-selection at the link
level if more than one pulse shape is optimised against the same set of
boundary conditions.

Only when the system evaluation is complete will it be known if the
boundary conditions were realistically set, therefore it is proposed to
denote these as \'preliminary\' boundary conditions. If they were set
too loose or too tight, then a further iteration of the study might be
necessary.

In general, the same procedure will be used for the optimisation of the
EGPRS2-B wide pulse shape on the DL as for the EGPRS2-B wide pulse shape
on the UL.

### 5.2.2 Time domain

The length of the optimised pulse shape shall not be longer than 6
reduced symbol periods. This is to avoid an increase in delay spread
which the MS equaliser needs to cope with.

### 5.2.3 Frequency domain

The adjacent channel protection of the optimised pulse shape (including
Tx impairments) shall be:

\- 50 dB at the 400 kHz offset

\- 58 dB at the 600 kHz offset

Measurements performed by network vendors will verify that these
criteria can be met for each candidate pulse shape.

For the 200 kHz offset, any criterion may be considered in the pulse
shape optimisation given that this criterion will be verified by the
System level studies (Section 9).

If an adjacent channel at the 200 kHz offset is used by a different
operator (i.e. no guard band exists), then the linearised GMSK pulse
would be the default on the allocation\'s edge channels.

5.3 Network configurations for pulse shape evaluation
-----------------------------------------------------

The network configurations that shall be used to evaluate the optimised
pulse shapes are given in Table 5.1 and 5.2.

5.4 Legacy MS Rx filter working assumption
------------------------------------------

This shall be used to calculate the Adjacent Channel Protection (ACP) of
the pulse shape candidates.

One proposal is to take the same assumption as for the EGPRS2-B wide
pulse shape for the UL i.e. the linearised GMSK filter truncated to ±160
kHz.

5.5 Legacy MS type
------------------

DARP mobiles are only able to cancel GMSK modulated interference, and
the wide pulse shape does not apply to GMSK modulation. When exposed to
an interferer using the wide pulse shape, it therefore follows that a
DARP mobile and a non-DARP mobile can be assumed to behave in the same
way.

6 Network level analysis
========================

6.1 Introduction
----------------

Network level analysis will be performed using the network
configurations defined in 4.2. This will be done for different
penetrations of optimised pulse shape being operated in downlink. The
purpose of network level analysis is to define different interferer
profiles for a certain penetration of the wider Tx pulse shape and a
given network configuration.

It is proposed to follow the same approach as the SAIC FS, whereby
network traces from system simulator generated for each of the agreed
network configurations are used to identify the median power level of
each interferer type.

6.2 Network scenarios and simulation assumptions
------------------------------------------------

The network scenarios that were considered are described in detail in
Section 5.3:

\- Scenario A: 4/12 BCCH from WIDER-1

\- Scenario B: 1/1 TCH from WIDER-1

\- Scenario C: 3/9 TCH from WIDER-2

\- Scenario D: 4/12 BCCH+3/9 TCH from WIDER-3

System simulation assumptions are in Table 2.

Additional assumptions were:

\- The wide pulse shape was the Candidate \#2 (see Section 7).

\- The back-off on BCCH for each of the EGPRS2-B modulation was assumed
to be 2 dB for QPSK and 4 dB for 16QAM and 32QAM.

\- Penetration of the wide pulse shape was set to 100 %.

\- The EGPRS2 FTP service load for the reference pulse shape was set to
saturation (the rate of newly arriving PS calls equalled the rate of
ending PS calls). For the wide pulse shape, the load was set to be equal
the reference load. Note that when equal traffic loads are assumed, a
lower activity time can be expected with the wide pulse.

\- Statistics are collected only from 18 cells around the centre of the
network to avoid border effects

### 6.2.1 Resource allocation

The PS and CS resources in Scenario A, B, C and D were allocated as
shown in Figure 6.1, Figure 6.2, Figure 6.3 and Figure 6.4. Note that
the PS and CS resources in Figure 6.3 and Figure 6.4 should be assumed
to hop over each TRX (BB hopping is used for scenario C and D).

6.3 Link to system interface
----------------------------

The link to system interface is described in detail in Section 8.2.

6.4 Interference statistics
---------------------------

In each burst, every interferer was classified into the following
categories:

\- IcX -- dominant co-channel narrow (X=N), wide (X=W) interference.

\- IaX -- dominant 1st adjacent channel narrow (X=N), wide (X=W)
interference.

\- restIcX -- sum of all co-channel interference powers excluding the
dominant interferer.

\- restIaX -- sum of all adjacent channel interference powers excluding
the dominant interferer.

The carrier to interferer ratio in each burst for each interferer was
then expressed as a CDF for each of the categories. The results are
shown in Annex B. All interferer levels were measured after slow fading
but before fast fading. This is to avoid duplicating the affects of fast
fading in the link level simulator.

The initial interference profile was DTS-2 from 3GPP TS 45.005 Annex L
(with the noise component excluded) with the interferers substituted
with wide pulse interferers in the case of wide pulse simulations
(candidate \#2 and candidate \#3).

6.5 Interference profile for link level analysis
------------------------------------------------

The interference statistics were used to construct the interferer models
using the following assumptions:

\- The median level (50th percentile in the CDF) was used to
characterise the power of each interferer type.

\- Interference ratios are specified relative to carrier-to-dominant
co-channel interference ratio (C/IcX). This makes it easier to sweep
over a range of C/I values in the link simulator. For example, to
populate the link to system mappings.

In addition, information is given about the probability of each type of
interferer.

### 6.5.1 Results

This section summarises the interference profiles for each network
scenarios and pulse shape (reference LGMSK pulse, candidate pulse \#2
and candidate pulse \#3). All levels have been given relative to the
dominant co-channel narrow interferer.Table 6.1

7 Pulse shape optimisation
==========================

7.1 Introduction
----------------

Pulse shape optimisation will be performed based on the preliminary
boundary conditions identified in 5.2. One or more candidate pulse
shapes may be proposed for each set of boundary conditions.

7.2 Candidate pulse shapes from \[4\]
-------------------------------------

### 7.2.1 Optimisation assumptions

It is specified in 5.2.3 that pulse shape optimisation shall include Tx
impairments - in particular, the ACP requirements shall be met while
taking into account the spectrum re-growth from the PA.

In the study, a memory-less parametric PA model was derived using gain
and phase measurements of a typical base station PA. Initial
verification of the PA model indicated that the spectrum re-growth was
pessimistic.

Note that while models exist in the public domain (e.g. \[5\]), these
were not felt to be sufficiently representative of a base station PA.

Numeric optimisation of the EGPRS2-B pulse shape was then performed
while taking into account the following factors:

\- Adjacent channel protection at the 1st and 2nd adjacent channel

\- Throughput maximization for EGPRS2-B

\- Spectrum re-growth after the PA, based on a PA model for BTS

\- Limited length in time domain (6 reduced symbol periods = 5 normal
symbol periods)

### 7.2.2 Results

#### 7.2.2.1 Spectrum

The spectrum of the 1st, 2nd and 3rd optimised pulse shapes with 16-QAM
are depicted in Figure 7.1, Figure 7.2 and Figure 7.3.

#### 7.2.2.2 Adjacent channel protection

The suppression of the candidate pulse shape when measured after the PA
with a linearised GMSK filter truncated to ±160 kHz is shown below for
the different frequency offsets:

Table 7.1

  ---------------------------- ----------- ------------- -------------- -------------
  **Suppression (after PA)**   **0 kHz**   **200 kHz**   **400 kHz**    **600 kHz**
  Candidate \#1                1.0         11.6 dB       48.8 dB (\*)   63.8 dB
  Candidate \#2                1.0         12.1 dB       50.1 dB        65.5 dB
  Candidate \#3                0.7         13.0 dB       52.3 dB        66.5 dB
  ---------------------------- ----------- ------------- -------------- -------------

Note. (\*) 50 dB requirement is only just not met in this case. However,
as verification of the 50 dB requirement should be with an actual PA
rather than a PA model, this could still be kept as a candidate.

8 Link level studies
====================

8.1 Introduction
----------------

Link level studies will be performed using the interferer profiles that
are obtained from the network level analysis. The purpose of the link
level studies is to: i) verify the legacy Rx model working assumption.
When there are no reports from MS vendors about legacy performance being
worse than the legacy Rx model working assumption, then the model will
be assumed to be valid; ii) evaluate the performance of candidate pulse
shapes using the MS vendors own Rx implementations for EGPRS2. The best
pulse shape in terms of throughput will be selected if there are more
than one candidate pulse shape for a given set of boundary conditions;
iii) derive the link to system interface that will be used in the system
level studies. This interface needs to consider the various MS Rx
implementations and the different services.

8.2 Link to system interface
----------------------------

### 8.2.1 Introduction

When considering a new pulse shape for EGPRS2-B, it is imperative that
both the throughput performance and the spectral characteristics of both
the new and the legacy pulse shape are captured sufficiently in the
system evaluation.

In this section, the link to system interface that is used in the Nokia
Siemens Networks system simulator to model the EGPRS2-B receiver is
described.

The interface design followed the methodology for deriving a model for
single antenna receivers described in \[6\]. One exception is the
factors used to determine the contribution of a type of interferer to
the total C/I, which have been computed from the raw BER performance of
the respective interferer type (rather than attenuation provided by the
front-end filter).

For the PS resources, the load for the reference case (data using the
LGMSK pulse shape), was set to saturation i.e. the rate of newly
arriving equalled the rate of ending PS calls. This corresponds to the
maximum offered load the network can support without being overloaded
and provided the reference load with which to compare the performance of
the LGMSK and the optimised pulse shape. When equal traffic loads are
used with the LGMSK and the optimised pulse shape, the activity time of
the optimised pulse shape can be expected to be lower.

### 8.2.2 Simulation assumptions

The link level simulator was configured using the assumptions in Table
8.1. Receiver impairments were enabled in the simulator.

Table 8.1. Link level simulator assumptions.

  -------------------- --------------------------------------------
  Parameter            Value
  Channel profile      Typical Urban (TU)
  Terminal speed       3 km/h
  Frequency band       900 MHz
  Frequency hopping    Ideal
  Interference/noise   WIDER-2 profile (see Section 6.5.1)
  Modulation backoff   None
  Antenna diversity    No
  Equalizer            Trellis based equaliser
  Tx pulse shape       LGMSK, candidate \#2 and candidate \#3
  Rx filter            RRC 325 kHz before windowing, roll-off 0.3
  Rx impairments       enabled
  Simulation length    20000 bursts per simulation point

candidate pulse \#2 and candidate pulse \#3) are given below

### 8.2.4. Legacy voice receiver

#### 8.2.4.1 Front-end filter

For the legacy voice receiver, the contribution of each interferer type
(in this case: CCI narrow, CCI wide, ACI narrow & ACI wide) to the total
interference has been characterised by its residual interference at the
output of the front-end filter (its in-band interference).

The calculation of in-band CIR was obtained by applying the relevant
attenuation of factors for each interferer type that is present in the
system before taking the sum. In Table 8.2, the attenuation factors are
given for each interferer type when assuming a LGMSK front-end filter
truncated to -160\...+160 kHz.

Table 8.2. Attenuation factors for a legacy voice receiver.

  ---------------------- --------- ---------
  Interferer             **ACI**   **CCI**
  **Ref (LGMSK)**        18.3 dB   0.0 dB
  **Wide (cand. \#2)**   12.1 dB   1.0 dB
  **Wide (cand. \#3)**   13.0 dB   0.7 dB
  ---------------------- --------- ---------

The mappings used to model the legacy voice receiver were generated from
data collected from a link level simulator which closely resembled the
conventional receiver of a mobile vendor.

### 8.2.5 EGPRS2 receiver

#### 8.2.5.1 Introduction

A state-of-the-art receiver could be expected to perform some kind of
interference processing that is in addition to the front-end filter.

To take into account the contribution of an interferer type to the
overall interference as seen by the EGPRS2 receiver, the attenuation
factors were obtained using simulated raw BER curves for each of the
respective interferer types rather than from the attenuation provided by
the front-end filter alone.

This is expected to lead to a link to system interface that better
reflects the properties of the different types of interferer.

This section gives the ACP factors for the reference LGMSK pulse,
candidate pulse \#2 and candidate pulse \#3 which were calculated from
raw BER curves obtained with the updated link level simulator.

#### 8.2.5.5 Receiver noise

The receiver thermal noise was calculated as follows:

> N (dBm) = 10log(kTB\*1000) + NF where k=1.3804e-23 J/K, T=298K,
> B=325000 or 270833 Hz, NF = 10
>
> N (dBm) = -119.5 + NF for normal symbol rate
>
> N (dBm) = -118.7 + NF for higher symbol rate

In the simulator, this noise component was implemented level relative to
the dominant co-channel narrow interferer.

pulse, candidate pulse \#2 and candidate pulse \#3.

#### 8.2.5.7 Second Stage Mapping (BER to BLER)

In this section, the second stage mappings are given, i.e. the expected
BLER as a function of the mean (µ) and the variance (σ) of the uncoded
BER for each burst of the RLC data block or speech frame that was
predicted by the 1st stage mapping.

In the case of DBS-11 and DBS-12, the RLC data block is interleaved over
a single burst, hence the variance in these cases is zero.

#### 8.2.5.8 Second Stage Mapping for Non-hopping Channel

The inter-burst correlation that exists in a non-hopping channel for a
slowly moving user can be seen in the BER to BLER mapping in the low
variance part of the surface. This is because the SNIR is correlated
between consecutive bursts resulting in a reduced variance of the BER
within a radio block.

For example, the figure below shows the surface taken from a non-hopping
simulation for DBS-5 (DTS-2 profile).

![](media/image32.wmf){width="5.240972222222222in" height="3.9375in"}

When the surface from a hopping simulation is examined, a corresponding
low variance part can also be seen. For example, the figure below shows
the surface taken from a hopping simulation for DBS-5 (DTS-2 profile).

![](media/image33.wmf){width="5.267361111111111in" height="3.9375in"}

This section investigates whether the surface obtained by a hopping
simulation can be used in non-hopping simulations.

First, the hopping surface is validated against data generated from a
hopping simulation for DBS-5 to DBS-12. In all figures, TU3 channel and
DTS-2 interference and wide Tx pulse has been assumed with the exception
of 32QAM for hopping data, where the LGMSK Tx pulse has been used.

height="2.626388888888889in"}

![](media/image35.wmf){width="5.768055555555556in"
height="2.8368055555555554in"}

The hopping surface is next validated against data generated from a
non-hopping simulation for DBS-5 to DBS-12.

![](media/image36.wmf){width="5.768055555555556in"
height="2.865972222222222in"}

![](media/image38.wmf){width="5.768055555555556in"
height="2.754861111111111in"}

The above figures show the error is negligible in both cases. It can
therefore be concluded that the BER to BLER mapping derived for the
hopping channel is also valid also for a non-hopping channel.

9 System level studies
======================

9.1 Introduction
----------------

System level studies will be performed for each network configuration,
to determine the impact of the candidate pulse shapes to legacy services
and to determine the throughput gain of the wide pulse shape compared to
the reference i.e. EGPRS2-B using the narrowband pulse shape.

9.2 System Performance Evaluation
---------------------------------

### 9.2.1 Evaluation method

The evaluation method is ffs.

### 9.2.2 System performance results

This clause contains the System performance results from Nokia & Nokia
Siemens Networks.

#### 9.2.2.1 Evaluation method

The load for the CS resources was set to give 2 % blocking. This
blocking criterion was kept across all scenarios and pulse shapes,
yielding more or less constant load in the CS resources.

In the PS resources, the load was determined by the call arrival rate,
which was determined by the number of data users in the network (one
call per user was assumed).

For the reference pulse simulation, the PS load was set to maximum,
which is when the rate of newly arrived calls equalled the rate of
ending calls (in this context a call is a temporary block flow).

For the wide pulse simulations, the PS load was first equal the PS load
in the reference pulse simulation. This is to provide an evaluation of
the existing users in the network. The PS load was then be increased to
maximum to determine if more data users can be supported with the wide
pulse without impacting legacy users (i.e. there is a \'data capacity\'
gain with the wide pulse). Note that this last step was not performed.

The PS load can be defined as the average number of active TBFs per
timeslot. This is shown in Figure 9.1 and Figure 9.3 for each
simulation. Figure 9.2 and Figure 9.4 depict the timeslot utilisation in
each simulation.

loads)

#### 9.2.2.2 Impact on speech quality

The impact of each pulse shape to legacy speech users is given in Figure
9.5 and Figure 9.6 -- reference pulse (NB) vs candidate pulse \#2
(WB\#2) vs candidate pulse \#3 (WB\#3).

The criteria for a BQC is average FER \> 1 % except in network scenario
WIDER-1 where it is \> 2 %.

The target percentage of BQCs is \< 5 %, which is more or less met in
all the scenarios.

Impact to speech quality is the difference in percentage of BQCs between
the reference pulse simulation and the wide pulse simulations.

At equal PS load, the impact is more or less the same between the
reference pulse and either of the wide pulses.

This means:

\- speech quality of legacy users is not degraded by either of the wide
pulses;

\- any increase in ACI from the wide pulse is entirely compensated by a
reduction in activity time;

\- it will not be possible to support more data users with either wide
pulse without some impact to legacy speech users.

height="2.848611111111111in"}

Figure 9.5: Percentage of BQCs at equal PS load

At maximum PS load, an impact to legacy voice users is apparent with the
candidate pulse shapes only for the network configuration WIDER-1 on the
TCH layer. This configuration has a high proportion of PS timeslots
relative to the total number of timeslots (4 PS timeslots out of a total
of 16). The impact to legacy voice users is nevertheless very small.

Figure 9.6: Percentage of BQCs at maximum PS loads

#### 9.2.2.3 Impact on data throughput

Three percentiles were evaluated for the connection throughput:

10 % - the 10 % of connections having the lowest throughput (\~cell
edge)

50 % - the throughput median (\~cell median)

90 % - 10 % of connections having the highest throughput (\~cell centre)

At equal PS load, the median throughput is about 35 kbit/s/TS for the
reference pulse. With the candidate pulse \#2, the gain was about 40 %
and with the candidate pulse \#3, the gain was about 35 %.

A constant gain can be seen for all of the users.

When the data throughput is evaluated at maximum PS loads, the median
throughput gain is lower at about 20 % for both pulse shapes. However,
there is a data capacity gain for both pulse shapes of about 20 %.

10 Summary
==========

The study considered a number of evaluation scenarios including
different network scenarios (WIDER-1, WIDER-2 and WIDER-3) and different
deployment strategies e.g. EGPRS2-B timeslot allocations on non-hopping
BCCH frequencies, hopping TCH frequencies and on hopping over both BCCH
and TCH frequencies (see 6.2 for details).

In general, the assumptions taken were worse case:

• Penetration of the EGPRS2-B service was set to 100 % (i.e. all the PS
resources were dedicated to EGPRS2-B);

• PS traffic load was set to saturation (corresponding to maximum
timeslot utilization);

• CS traffic load was set to give 2 % blocking in all the scenarios.

Two pulse shapes with different spectral properties were evaluated
(denoted as Candidate \#2 and Candidate \#3). They exhibited lower
inter-symbol interference than the LGMSK pulse shape and lower
adjacent-channel protection (see clause 7.2.2.2 for details). Their link
level performance (as well as the reference pulse\'s) was disclosed
corresponding to the TU3 propagation channel for the 900MHz band when
assuming ideal frequency hopping (see clauses 8.2.2 and 8.2.3).The
throughput performance of EGPRS2-B users was evaluated for each pulse
shape. The findings can be found in clause 9.2.2.3 and are summarized in
Table 10.1 (for the scenario where the reference load was set to
saturation and the network load when evaluating the wide pulse shapes
was set to the reference load) and in Table 10.2 (for the scenario where
the reference load and the network load when evaluating the wide pulse
shapes was set to saturation).

In the figures in Table 10.2, data capacity is defined by the call
arrival rate that can be supported before the network becomes saturated
(i.e. when the call arrival rate equaled the call ending rate) and data
capacity gain is the percentage difference in data capacity between the
wide bandwidth pulse and the LGMSK pulse. Throughput gain is the
percentage difference in the median throughput of the data calls between
the wide bandwidth pulse and the LGMSK pulse measured before the network
becomes saturated (i.e. when the call arrival rate equaled the call
ending rate). The findings demonstrate that a throughput gain of 13 --
27 % and a data capacity gain of 16 -- 24 % (depending on the network
scenario and pulse shape) can be achieved when a wide bandwidth pulse
shape is utilized. This is a result of the improved receiver performance
as a result of the lower inter-symbol interference.

The study also evaluated the impact of the lower adjacent-channel
protection on the speech quality of legacy users. The findings can be
found in clause 9.2.2.2 and are summarized in Table 10.3 and Table 10.4.

The findings demonstrate that the lower adjacent-channel protection did
not degrade the speech performance of a legacy mobile, or resulted in a
degradation considered acceptable, even though the network saturation
level was reached. This is because there were fewer PS timeslots than CS
timeslots in the evaluated scenarios. The speech performance in
Table 10.3 had the added benefit of lower timeslot occupancy of the wide
pulse shape as a result of the throughput gain.

11 Conclusion
=============

Based on the findings of the WIDER study item which have been collated
in this Technical Report, it is concluded that for the evaluated
scenarios, a throughput gain of 13 -- 27 % and a data capacity gain of
16 -- 24 % (depending on the network scenario and pulse shape) can be
achieved for EGPRS2-B users when a wide bandwidth pulse shape is
utilized without degrading the speech performance of a legacy mobile, or
resulted in a degradation considered acceptable, even though the network
saturation level was reached. While the evaluated scenarios were
believed to represent the most relevant for the EGPRS2-B service, they
should not be considered as representing all network scenarios. Hence it
is recommended that the mandatory Tx pulse shall be the linearised GMSK
pulse and the use of the wide bandwidth pulse shall be optional to an
operator.

Further investigations into the performance of a wide bandwidth pulse
shape and its impact to legacy users may be taken into account into
future versions of this Technical Report.
