1.4 Restrictions
----------------

Independently of what is stated elsewhere in this and other 3GPP
specifications, mobile station support for PBCCH and PCCCH is optional
for A/Gb-mode of operation. The network shall never enable PBCCH and
PCCCH.

2 General
=========

The radio sub‑system link control aspects that are addressed are as
follows:

‑ Handover;

‑ RF Power control in *A/Gb mode*, including fast power control for
E-TCH and enhanced power control for TCH and O-TCH;

‑ RF Power control in *Iu mode*, including fast power control for E-TCH
and enhanced power control for DBPSCH (in MAC-Dedicated and MAC-DTM
states);

‑ Radio link Failure;

‑ Cell selection and re-selection in Idle mode, in Group Receive mode,
in GPRS mode, in broadcast/multicast receive mode and in EC operation
and PEO (see 3GPP TS 43.022);

‑ Coverage class selection in EC operation;

\- CTS mode tasks.

NOTE: A distinction is made between *A/Gb mode* and *Iu mode* only when
necessary. Procedures and mechanisms described in this TS apply to both
modes of operation unless otherwise stated. In *Iu mode*, unless
otherwise stated, DBPSCH covers TCH, PDTCH and FLO.

Handover is required to maintain a call in progress as a MS engaged in a
point‑to‑point call or with access to the uplink of a channel used for a
voice group call passes from one cell coverage area to another and may
also be employed to meet network management requirements, e.g. relief of
congestion.

Handover may occur during a call from one TCH or multiple TCHs (in the
case of multislot configuration) to another TCH or multiple TCHs. It may
also occur from DCCH to DCCH or from DCCH to one or multiple TCH(s),
e.g. during the initial signalling period at call set‑up. Additionally
in *Iu mode*, handover may occur in MAC-Dedicated and MAC-DTM states:

‑ on PDTCH or multiple PDTCHs (in the case of multislot configuration)
on DBPSCH(s) to another PDTCH or multiple PDTCHs on DBPSCH(s);

‑ for FLO, from one DBPSCH or multiple DBPSCHs (in the case of multislot
configuration) to another DBPSCH or multiple DBPSCHs.

The handover may be either from channel(s) on one cell to other
channel(s) on a surrounding cell, or between channels on the same cell
which are carried on the same frequency band. Examples are given of
handover strategies, however, these will be determined in detail by the
network operator.

For a multiband MS, the handover described is also allowed between any
channels on different cells which are carried on different frequency
bands, e.g. between a GSM 900/TCH and a DCS 1 800/TCH. Handover between
two co‑located cells, carried on different frequency bands, is
considered as inter‑cell handover irrespective of the handover
procedures used.

For a multi-RAT MS, i.e. an MS supporting multiple radio access
technologies, handover is allowed between GSM and other radio access
technologies.

NOTE: At handover, the MS will normally not be able to verify the PLMN
of the target cell and will thus assume that the same system information
apply after the handover unless the network provides new system
information.

Adaptive control of the RF transmit power from an MS and optionally from
the BSS is implemented in order to optimize the uplink and downlink
performance and minimize the effects of co‑channel interference in the
system.

The criteria for determining radio link failure are specified in order
to ensure that calls which fail either from loss of radio coverage or
unacceptable interference are satisfactorily handled by the network.
Radio link failure may result in either re‑establishment or release of
the call in progress. For channels used for a voice group call, an radio
uplink failure results in the freeing up of the uplink.

Procedures for cell selection and re‑selection whilst in Idle mode (i.e.
not actively processing a call), are specified in order to ensure that a
mobile is camped on a cell with which it can reliably communicate on
both the radio uplink and downlink. The operations of an MS in Idle Mode
are specified in 3GPP TS 43.022.

Cell re-selection is also performed by the MS when attached to GPRS,
except when the MS simultaneously has a circuit switched connection.
Optional procedures are also specified for network controlled cell
re-selection for GPRS. Cell re-selection for GPRS is defined in
subclause 10.1.

For a multi-RAT MS, cell selection and re-selection is allowed between
GSM and other radio access technologies.

An MS listening to a voice group call or a voice broadcast use cell
re‑selection procedures to change cell. This may be supported by a list
of cells carrying the voice group or voice broadcast call downlink,
provided to the MS by the network. The operations of an MS in Group
Receive Mode are specified in 3GPP TS 43.022.

Information signalled between the MS and BSS is summarized in tables 1,
2 and 3. A full specification of the Layer 1 header is given in 3GPP TS
44.004, of the Layer 3 fields in 3GPP TS 44.018, and of the Layer 2
fields in 3GPP TS 44.060.

When EC operation has been enabled, Coverage Class selection is
performed by the mobile station in Idle mode to ensure that a mobile
station will be able to communicate on the extended coverage common
control channel (EC-CCCH). The Coverage Classes for uplink and downlink
dedicated channels are assigned by the network in Packet Transfer mode
to ensure that a mobile station will be able to communicate on the
extended coverage packet data traffic channel (EC-PDTCH) and its
associated control channel (EC-PACCH).

For CTS, information signalled between the CTS-MS and CTS-FP is
summarized in tables 4, 5 and 6. A full specification of the CTS Layer 3
fields is given in 3GPP TS 44.056.

For COMPACT, specific procedures are defined in clause 12.

During the reception of an MBMS session, the mobile station is in
broadcast/multicast receive mode. In this state, the MS performs
autonomous cell re-selection.

If the MS is a member of at least one Closed Subscriber Group, the MS
may perform cell re-selection to CSG cells.

3 Handover
==========

3.1 Overall process
-------------------

The overall handover process is implemented in the MS, BSS and MSC.
Measurement of radio subsystem downlink performance and signal levels
received from surrounding cells, is made in the MS. These measurements
are signalled to the BSS for assessment. The BSS measures the uplink
performance for the MS being served and also assesses the signal level
of interference on its idle traffic channels. Initial assessment of the
measurements in conjunction with defined thresholds and handover
strategy may be performed in the BSS. Assessment requiring measurement
results from other BTS or other information resident in the MSC, may be
performed in the MSC.

3GPP TS 23.009 describes the handover procedures to be used in PLMNs.

3.2 MS measurement procedure
----------------------------

A procedure shall be implemented in the MS by which it monitors the
downlink RX signal level and quality from its serving cell and the
downlink RX signal level and BSIC of surrounding BTS. The method of
identification of surrounding BTS is described in subclause 7.2. The
requirements for the MS measurements are given in subclause 8.1.

3.3 BSS measurement procedure
-----------------------------

A procedure shall be implemented in the BSS by which it monitors the
uplink RX signal level and quality from each MS being served by the
cell. In the case of a multislot configuration the evaluation shall be
performed on a timeslot per timeslot basis. A procedure shall be
implemented by which the BSS monitors the levels of interference on its
idle traffic channels.

3.4 Strategy
------------

The handover strategy employed by the network for radio link control
determines the handover decision that will be made based on the
measurement results reported by the MS/BSS and various parameters set
for each cell. Network directed handover may also occur for reasons
other than radio link control, e.g. to control traffic distribution
between cells. The exact handover strategies will be determined by the
network operator, a detailed example of a basic overall algorithm
appears in annex A. Possible types of handover are as follows:

Inter‑cell handover:

Intercell handover from the serving cell to a surrounding cell will
normally occur either when the handover measurements show low RXLEV
and/or RXQUAL on the current serving cell and a better RXLEV available
from a surrounding cell, or when a surrounding cell allows communication
with a lower TX power level. This typically indicates that an MS is on
the border of the cell area.

Intercell handover may also occur from the DCCH on the serving cell to a
TCH or multislot configuration on another cell during call
establishment. This may be used as a means of providing successful call
establishment when no suitable TCH resource is available on the current
serving cell.

Inter‑cell handover between cells using different frequency bands is
allowed for a multi band MS.

Inter‑cell handover between cells using different radio access
technologies is allowed for a multi-RAT MS.

Intra‑cell handover:

Intra‑cell handover from one channel/timeslot configuration in the
serving cell to another channel/timeslot configuration in the same cell
will normally be performed if the handover measurements show a low
RXQUAL, but a high RXLEV on the serving cell. This indicates a
degradation of quality caused by interference even though the MS is
situated within the serving cell. The intra‑cell handover should provide
a channel with a lower level of interference. Intra‑cell handover can
occur either to a timeslot on a new carrier or to a different timeslot
on the same carrier. Similarly, intra‑cell handover may occur between
different multislot configurations in the same cell. These multislot
configurations may comprise different number of timeslots and may partly
overlap.

Intra-cell handover from one of the bands of operation to another one is
allowed for a multiband MS.

3GPP TS 48.008 defines the causes for handover that may be signalled
from BSS to MSC.

4 RF power control
==================

4.1 Overall process
-------------------

RF power control is employed to minimize the transmit power required by
MS or BSS whilst maintaining the quality of the radio links. By
minimizing the transmit power levels, interference to co‑channel users
is reduced.

4.2 MS implementation
---------------------

### 4.2.1 General

RF power control shall be implemented in the MS.

In *A/Gb mode*, the power control level to be employed by the MS on each
uplink channel, except PDCH, is indicated by means of the power control
information sent either in the layer 1 header of each SACCH message
block (see 3GPP TS 44.004) on the corresponding downlink channel, or in
a dedicated signalling block (see 3GPP TS 44.018). Power control for
PDCH is defined in subclause 10.2.

Similarly in *Iu mode* in MAC-Dedicated state and MAC-DTM state, the
power control level to be employed by the MS on each uplink channel, is
indicated by means of the power control information sent either in the
layer 1 header of each SACCH message block (see 3GPP TS 44.004) on the
corresponding downlink channel, or in a dedicated signalling block.
Power control for MAC-Shared state is defined in subclause 10.2.

The MS shall employ the most recently commanded power control level
appropriate to each channel for all transmitted bursts on either a TCH
(including handover access burst), FACCH, SACCH, PDTCH or SDCCH. For FLO
in *Iu mode* the MS shall employ the most recently commanded power
control level appropriate to each DBPSCH for all transmitted bursts
(including radio packets, handover access burst and SACCH).

The MS shall confirm the power control level that it is currently
employing in the SACCH L1 header on each uplink channel. The indicated
value shall be the power control level actually used by the mobile for
the last burst of the previous SACCH period.

When on an E-TCH, the MS shall, if so indicated by the BSS in the SACCH
L1 header (see 3GPP TS 44.004) or Assignment command (see 3GPP
TS 44.018), use FPC (fast power control). The MS shall employ the most
recently commanded fast power control level on each uplink E-TCH
channel. The power control level to be employed by the MS is indicated
by means of the power control information sent via E-IACCH once every
FPC reporting period (see subclause 4.7). If FPC is in use, the MS shall
report, in the SACCH L1 header, the power control level used at the end
of the normal power control reporting period.

When on an E-TCH using 8 PSK for the uplink, the MS shall use the
E-IACCH in the uplink for fast measurement reporting.

In *A/Gb mode*, when assigned a TCH or O-TCH, the MS shall configure the
channel in enhanced power control (EPC) mode if so commanded by BSS in
the channel assignment (see 3GPP TS 44.018). On such a channel, EPC may
be used for uplink power control and/or downlink power control.

Similarly in *Iu mode*, when assigned a DBPSCH, the MS shall configure
the channel in enhanced power control (EPC) mode if so commanded by BSS
in the channel assignment. On such a channel, EPC may be used for uplink
power control and/or downlink power control.

The enhanced power control (EPC) is part of the GERAN Feature Package 2
(see 3GPP TS 24.008).

When on a channel in EPC mode,

\- the MS shall use the EPCCH in the uplink for EPC measurement
reporting (see subclause 8.4.1b).

\- the MS shall, depending on what is signalled in the L1 header of the
downlink SACCH (see 3GPP TS 44.004) and during channel assignment (see
3GPP TS 44.018), obey either the EPC Uplink Power Control Command (sent
on the EPCCH in the downlink) or the Ordered MS Power Level (sent in the
L1 header of the downlink SACCH).

\- If the signalling indicates that EPC shall be used in the uplink, the
MS shall employ the most recently commanded EPC power control level, as
indicated by the EPC Uplink Power Control Command sent on the
corresponding EPCCH in the downlink. The EPC Uplink Power Control
Command is sent once every EPC reporting period (see subclause 8.4.1b).
The MS shall ignore the Ordered MS Power Level sent in the SACCH L1
header in the downlink.

\- If the signalling indicates that normal power control shall be used
in the uplink, the MS shall ignore the EPC Uplink Power Control Command
and use normal power control.

\- the MS shall confirm, in the SACCH L1 header on the uplink, the RF
power control level used at the last burst of the previous SACCH period,
as specified for normal power control.

NOTE: The term \"normal power control\" is used in this specification
only for clarification and is otherwise only referred to as \"power
control\".

In case of a multislot configuration, each bi‑directional channel shall
be power controlled individually by the corresponding SACCH, E-IACCH or
EPCCH, whichever is applicable. Power control information on downlink
unidirectional channels shall be neglected.

### 4.2.2 (EC-)RACH

#### 4.2.2.1 Random access procedure when EC operation is not enabled

When accessing a cell on the RACH (random access) and before receiving
the first power command during a communication on a DCCH or TCH (after
an IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT), on DCS 1800 and PCS 1900 frequency bands the
MS shall use the power level defined by the MS\_TXPWR\_MAX\_CCH
parameter broadcast on the BCCH of the cell. On all other bands the MS
shall limit the power level to LB\_MS\_TXPWR\_MAX\_CCH + Band\_offset,
if LB\_MS\_TXPWR\_MAX\_CCH parameter is broadcast, otherwise the power
level is limited according to the MS\_TXPWR\_MAX\_CCH parameter.
Band\_offset equals 0 dB for GSM 850, ER-GSM 900 and GSM 900, -2 dB for
GSM 700 and -6 dB for GSM 400. As an exception, on the DCS 1800 band the
class 3 DCS 1 800 capable MS shall use the power level defined by
MS\_TXPWR\_MAX\_CCH plus the value POWER\_OFFSET also broadcast on the
BCCH of the cell.

In addition, if the network indicates support for MS power reduction by
broadcasting parameter INIT\_PWR\_RED (see 3GPP TS 44.018) and if the
latest RLA-value, RLA\_C or RLA\_P (see section 6.1) for the measured
signal strength from the BTS the MS is accessing is -48 dBm or higher
immediately before the access attempt, the MS power shall not exceed

PRED = min{(MS\_TXPWR\_MAX\_CCH, (LB\_MS\_TXPWR\_MAX\_CCH +
Band\_offset), (P5‑INIT\_PWR\_RED)} for GSM 400, GSM 700, T-GSM 810, GSM
850, ER-GSM 900 and GSM 900 and

PRED = min{ MS\_TXPWR\_MAX\_CCH, (P0+2‑INIT\_PWR\_RED)} for DCS 1800 and
PCS 1900,

where P5 and P0 are the power control levels for respective band in 3GPP
TS 45.005.

The power reduction only applies for the first transmission of the
access burst on the RACH. If the initial transmission fails due to no
response from the network, the MS shall not apply power reduction in
remaining transmissions. The power reduction also applies for DCCH or
TCH (after an IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT) under the same received signal
strength conditions until the ordered power control level in the SACCH
L1 header differs from MS\_TXPWR\_MAX\_CCH or LB\_MS\_TXPWR\_MAX\_CCH +
Band\_offset, whichever is applicable or a L3 message with a valid power
control command is received.\
If INIT\_PWR\_RED is not broadcast, no power reduction shall apply.

If a power control level defined in 3GPP TS 45.005 is received but the
level is not supported by the MS, the MS shall use the supported output
power which is closest to the output power indicated by the received
power control level.

#### 4.2.2.2 Random access procedure when EC operation is enabled

When accessing a cell on the RACH or EC-RACH when EC operation has been
enabled the MS shall use an open-loop power control in determining the
power level for the first transmission.

The calculated output power, P, to be employed by the MS for the first
transmission of the access burst (including any blind physical layer
transmissions) on (EC-)RACH after uplink coverage class selection (see
subclause 6.10.3) shall be:

P = min(MSPWR, MS\_TXPWR\_MAX\_CCH, L+TARGET\_RX\_PWR)

where

> TARGET\_RX\_PWR = BT\_Threshold\_UL + BT\_Threshold\_UL\_Margin
>
> L = BSPWR - RLA\_EC (see subclause 6.9)
>
> BT\_Threshold\_UL indicates the BS\_RX\_PWR below which blind physical
> layer transmissions are used on EC-RACH (broadcast in EC SI 2, see
> 3GPP TS 44.018 \[17\])
>
> BT\_Threshold\_UL\_Margin indicates the power margin, in dB, above
> BT\_Threshold\_UL (see 3GPP TS 44.018 \[17\]) that is used to indicate
> the targeted received power at the BTS.
>
> BSPWR is the output power of the BTS used on FCCH and EC-SCH
> (broadcast in EC SI 2 (see 3GPP TS 44.018 \[17\]))
>
> MS\_TXPWR\_MAX\_CCH is the maximum allowed output power on the
> (EC-)RACH, broadcast in EC SI 2 (see 3GPP TS 44.018 \[17\]) and
>
> MSPWR is the nominal maximum output power of the MS.

All power values are expressed in dBm, except L and
BT\_Threshold\_UL\_Margin which are expressed in dB.

If the first transmission of the access burst (including any blind
physical layer transmissions) fails (i.e., no response is received from
the network), the calculated output power for retransmissions shall be:

P = min(MSPWR, MS\_TXPWR\_MAX\_CCH).

The MS may round the calculated output power P to the nearest nominal
output power value (see 3GPP TS 45.005). The output power actually
transmitted by the MS shall fulfil the absolute accuracy as specified in
3GPP TS 45.005 \[24\]. In addition, the transmitted power shall be a
monotonic function of the calculated output power and any change of 2 dB
in the calculated value shall correspond to a change of 2 ± 1.5 dB in
the transmitted value.

If a calculated output power is not supported by the MS, the MS shall
use the supported output power which is closest to the calculated output
power.

An MS transmitting blind physical layer transmissions shall use the same
output power on all blind physical layer transmissions of the access
burst.

4.3 MS power control range
--------------------------

The range over which a MS shall be capable of varying its RF output
power shall be from its maximum output down to its minimum, in steps of
nominally 2 dB.

3GPP TS 45.005 gives a detailed definition of the RF power level step
size and tolerances.

In *A/Gb mode,* the fast power control scheme for E-TCH and the enhanced
power control scheme for TCH and O-TCH are based on differential control
to adjust the employed RF power level. Similarly in *Iu mode*, the fast
power control scheme for E-TCH and the enhanced power control scheme for
DBPSCH are also based on differential control to adjust the employed RF
power level. The possible DL power control commands are listed in the
following table.

  ---------- -----------------------------------------------------
  Codeword   Power control command
  0          Not used
  1          Increase output power by four power control levels
  2          Increase output power by three power control levels
  3          Increase output power by two power control levels
  4          Increase output power by one power control level
  5          No output power level change
  6          Decrease output power by one power control level
  7          Decrease output power by two power control levels
  ---------- -----------------------------------------------------

If a power control command is received but the requested output power is
not supported by the MS, the MS shall use the supported output power
which is closest to the requested output power.

4.4 BSS implementation
----------------------

In *A/Gb mode*, RF power control, including fast power control for E-TCH
and enhanced power control for TCH and O-TCH, may optionally be
implemented in the BSS.

Similarly in *Iu mode*, RF power control, including fast power control
for E-TCH and enhanced power control for DBPSCH, may optionally be
implemented in the BSS.

### 4.4.1 VAMOS subchannel power control for BSS in downlink

For a TCH in *VAMOS mode* in downlink, the BSS may optionally implement
VAMOS subchannel specific power control. A BSS supporting VAMOS shall
support AQPSK modulation with at least one value of $\alpha\ $(see 3GPP
TS 45.004).

4.5 BSS power control range
---------------------------

The range over which the BSS shall be capable of reducing its RF output
power from its maximum level shall be nominally 30 dB, in 15 steps of
nominally 2 dB.

3GPP TS 45.005 gives a detailed definition of the RF power level step
size and tolerances.

4.6 Strategy
------------

The RF power control strategy employed by the network determines the
ordered power level that is signalled to the MS, and the power level
that is employed by the BSS.

The power level to be employed in each case will be based on the
measurement results reported by the MS/BTS and various parameters set
for each cell. The exact strategies will be determined by the network
operator. A detailed example of a basic algorithm appears in annex A.

4.7 Timing
----------

### 4.7.1 Normal Power Control

Upon receipt of a command from an SACCH to change its power level on the
corresponding uplink channel, the MS shall change to the new level at a
rate of one nominal 2 dB power control step every 60 ms (13 TDMA
frames), i.e. a range change of 15 steps should take about 900 ms. The
change shall commence at the first TDMA frame belonging to the next
reporting period (as specified in subclause 8.4). The MS shall change
the power one nominal 2 dB step at a time, at a rate of one step every
60 ms following the initial change, irrespective of whether actual
transmission takes place or not.

In case of channel change, except for multislot configuration change,
the commanded power control level shall be applied on each new channel
immediately. The multislot configuration change message does not command
the MS to use new power control levels. For those time slots not used by
the MS before the multislot configuration change procedure, the MS shall
use the power control level used on the main channel before the
multislot configuration change.

### 4.7.2 Fast Power Control

Switching between the normal power control mechanism and FPC shall be
done if FPC is enabled or disabled via signalling in the SACCH L1
header. The respective power control mechanism to be used shall then be
active as from the first TDMA frame belonging to the next reporting
period (see subclause 8.4). The initial power control level to be used
by the MS immediately after switching shall, in both cases, be the level
last commanded by the normal power control mechanism.

The basic timing cycle for the fast power control mechanism is the FPC
reporting period of length 4 TDMA frames, which is mapped into the
26-multiframe according to the following figure.

DL measurements made during RP(n) shall be reported to the network
during the next occurance of RP((n+2) mod 6). Power control commands
received from the network during RP(n) are effectuated on the
corresponding UL channel during the next occurance of RP((n+1) mod 6).

### 4.7.3 Enhanced Power Control

When in enhanced power control (EPC) mode, the MS shall for uplink power
control obey either the EPC Uplink Power Control Commands or the Ordered
MS Power Level. This is controlled by signalling via the SACCH L1 header
in the downlink (see 3GPP TS 44.004) and during channel assignment (see
3GPP TS 44.018). The type of power control commands to be obeyed by the
MS during one SACCH period is determined by what is signalled in the L1
header during the previous SACCH period and, before any SACCH block has
been correctly decoded, by what is signalled during channel assignment.

> NOTE: This signalling via the SACCH L1 header and during channel
> assignment only controls the uplink power control mechanism. In *A/Gb
> mode*, EPC measurement procedures shall always be followed by the MS
> when on a TCH or O-TCH in EPC mode. Similarly in *Iu mode*, EPC
> measurement procedures shall always be followed by the MS when on a
> DBPSCH in EPC mode.

When the MS is ordered to obey the Ordered MS Power Level, the timing
according to subclause 4.7.1 applies.

When the MS is ordered to obey the EPC Uplink Power Control Command, it
shall, upon receipt of an EPC Uplink Power Control Command on an EPCCH
in the downlink, change to the new power level on the corresponding
uplink channel at the first TDMA frame belonging to the next EPC
reporting period (as specified in subclause 8.4.1b).

4.8 Dedicated channels used for a voice group call or voice broadcast
---------------------------------------------------------------------

The network shall not allocate the uplink of the channel used for a
voice group call to more than one MS. If marked busy, no other MS shall
transmit on the channel. This marking is indicated by the network, as
defined in 3GPP TS 43.068 and 3GPP TS 44.018. Any MS allocated the
uplink of a channel used for a voice group call shall only transmit if
the uplink is marked busy, and shall stop using the uplink if it happens
to become marked free. An MS not allocated the uplink may perform a
random access procedure on the uplink to gain access to talk, only if
the uplink is marked as free.

On a channel used during a voice group call, the uplink power control
shall only apply to the MS currently allocated that uplink, and the MS
power control level ordered by the network shall be ignored by all other
MSs listening to the downlink.

When performing a random access on a cell to gain access to the uplink
of a channel used for a voice group call, until receiving the first
dedicated power command from the network, the MS shall use the last
received power level command as defined by the MS\_TXPWR\_MAX\_CCH
parameter broadcast on the BCCH of the cell, or if MS\_TXPWR\_MAX\_CCH
corresponds to a power control level not supported by the MS as defined
by its power class in 3GPP TS 45.005, the MS shall act as though the
closest supported power control level had been broadcast.

RF downlink power control will normally not be applied on channels used
for a voice group call or voice broadcast.

5 Radio link failure
====================

5.1 Criterion
-------------

The criterion for determining Radio Link Failure in the MS shall be
based on the success rate of decoding messages on the downlink SACCH. In
*A/Gb mode*, for a circuit switched multislot configuration, only the
main SACCH shall be used for determining Radio Link Failure. Similarly
in *Iu mode*, for a multislot configuration in MAC-Dedicated State or
MAC-DTM State, only the main SACCH shall be used for determining Radio
Link Failure.

For packet transfer mode in *A/Gb mode*, Radio Link Failure is
determined by the RLC/MAC protocol (see 3GPP TS 44.060).

For *Iu mode* in MAC-Shared State, Radio Link Failure is determined by
the RLC/MAC protocol.

5.2 MS procedure
----------------

The aim of determining radio link failure in the MS is to ensure that
calls with unacceptable voice/data quality, which cannot be improved
either by RF power control or handover, are either re‑established or
released in a defined manner. In general the parameters that control the
forced release should be set such that the forced release will not
normally occur until the call has degraded to a quality below that at
which the majority of subscribers would have manually released. This
ensures that, for example, a call on the edge of a radio coverage area,
although of bad quality, can usually be completed if the subscriber
wishes.

The radio link failure criterion is based on the radio link counter S.
If the MS is unable to decode a SACCH message (BFI = 1),S is decreased
by 1. In the case of a successful reception of a SACCH message (BFI = 0)
S is increased by 2. In any case S shall not exceed the value of
RADIO\_LINK\_TIMEOUT. If S reaches 0 a radio link failure shall be
declared. The action to be taken is specified in 3GPP TS 44.018. The
RADIO\_LINK\_TIMEOUT parameter is transmitted by each BSS in the BCCH
data (see table 1).

The MS shall continue transmitting as normal on the uplink until S
reaches 0.

The algorithm shall start after the assignment of a dedicated channel
and S shall be initialized to RADIO\_LINK\_TIMEOUT.

The detailed operation shall be as follows:

\- the radio link time‑out algorithm shall be stopped at the reception
of a channel change command;

\- (re‑)initialization and start of the algorithm shall be done whenever
the MS switches to a new dedicated channel (this includes the old
channel in assignment and handover failure cases), at the latest in
*A/Gb mode* when the main signalling link (see 3GPP TS 44.018) has been
established or in *Iu mode* immediately after the MS is ready to receive
(see 3GPP TS 45.010);

\- the RADIO\_LINK\_TIMEOUT value used at (re‑)initialization shall be
that used on the previous channel (in the Immediate Assignment case the
value received on the BCCH), or the value received on SACCH if the MS
has received a RADIO\_LINK\_TIMEOUT value on the new channel before the
initialization;

\- if the first RADIO\_LINK\_TIMEOUT value on the SACCH is received on
the new channel after the initialization, the counter shall be
re‑initialized with the new value.

An MS listening to a voice group call or a voice broadcast, upon a
downlink radio link failure shall return to idle mode and perform cell
re‑selection.

5.3 BSS procedure
-----------------

The criteria for determining radio link failure in the BSS should be
based upon either the error rate on the uplink SACCH(s) or on
RXLEV/RXQUAL measurements of the MS. The exact criteria to be employed
shall be determined by the network operator.

For channels used for a voice group call, the radio link failure
procedures in the BSS shall be reset upon the re‑allocation of the
uplink to another MS. Upon a uplink radio failure, the network shall
mark it as free, see subclause 4.8.

Whenever the uplink is not used, and for channels used for voice
broadcast, the BSS radio link failure procedures shall not apply on that
channel.

6 Idle mode tasks
=================

6.1 Introduction
----------------

Whilst in idle mode, an MS shall implement the cell selection and
re‑selection procedures described in 3GPP TS 43.022. These procedures
make use of measurements and sub‑procedures described in this subclause.

The procedures ensure that the MS is camped on a cell from which it can
reliably decode downlink data and with which it has a high probability
of communications on the uplink. Once the MS is camped on a cell, access
to the network is allowed.

At cell selection, before accessing the network, the MS shall decode all
information about dynamic mapping of ARFCN numbers, if used by the
network. As an exception, a single access attempt (including repetitions
allowed for channel request) is allowed using stored information that
has been received from the same PLMN within the last 24 hours.
Alternatively a single access attempt is allowed using stored
information, received from the same PLMN, without decoding all SI 15
instances if the Dynamic ARFCN Mapping change mark (See 3GPP TS 44.018)
in the stored information is equal to that decoded from any of SI 15
instances. The MS shall always use the most recent information about
Dynamic ARFCN Mapping. EC-GSM-IoT does not support Dynamic ARFCN
Mapping.

This clause makes use of terms defined in 3GPP TS 43.022.

The MS shall not use the discontinuous reception (DRX) mode of operation
(i.e. powering itself down when it is not expecting paging messages from
the network) while performing the cell selection algorithm defined in
3GPP TS 43.022. However use of powering down is permitted at all other
times in idle mode.

For the purpose of cell selection and reselection, the MS shall be
capable of detecting and synchronizing to a BCCH carrier and read the
(EC-)BCCH data at reference sensitivity level or input level at
reference performance, whichever applicable, and reference interference
ratios or interference ratios at reference performance, whichever
applicable, as specified in 3GPP TS 45.005. An MS in idle mode shall
always fulfil the performance requirements specified in 3GPP TS 45.005
at input levels down to the reference sensitivity level and interference
ratios down to the reference interference ratio. The allowed error rates
(see 3GPP TS 45.005) might impact the cell selection and reselection
procedure, e.g. trigger cell reselection. Moreover, one consequence of
the allowed error rates is that:

\- in the case of no frequency hopping and a TU3 (TU6 for GSM 400, TU3.6
for GSM 700, TU1.5 for DCS 1 800 and PCS 1 900) propagation profile, it
can not be expected that an MS will respond to paging unless the
interference ratio is 2 dB higher than the specified reference
interference ratio for C/Ic and C/Ia; and

\- in the case of TU1.2 (no FH) propagation profile (GSM 850, GSM 900,
DCS 1800 and PCS 1900) and EC-GSM-IoT, it can not be expected that an MS
will respond to paging unless the received signal level is \[2\] dB
higher than the specified input signal level, or the interference ratio
is \[2\] dB higher than the specified cochannel or adjacent channel
interference ratio, respectively, at reference performance of EC-CCCH/D
for the used Coverage Class.

For the purposes of cell selection and reselection, the MS is required
to maintain an average of received signal levels for all monitored
frequencies. These quantities termed the \"received level averages\"
(RLA\_C), shall be unweighted averages of the received signal levels
measured in dBm. The accuracy of the received signal level measurements
for idle mode tasks shall be the same as for radio link measurements
(see subclause 8.1.2).

As an exception, an EC-GSM-IoT capable MS shall measure RLA\_EC as
specified in subclause 6.9 when evaluating an EC-GSM-IoT cell for
selection and reselection. An EC-GSM-IoT capable MS that also supports
GPRS services using GPRS or EGPRS TBFs shall measure RLA\_GC as
specified in subclause 6.9a when evaluating a non EC-GSM-IoT cell for
selection and reselection.

An MS that has enabled PEO or that supports PEO and that is attempting
to decode the Base Station Identity Code (BSIC), shall use the 9 bit
BSIC consisting of the 6 bit BSIC field transmitted in the SCH and the 3
bit Radio frequency Colour Code (RCC) field transmitted in System
Information and AGCH /PCH (see 3GPP TS 44.018 and 3GPP TS 23.003), for
later BSIC verification, see sub-clause 7.2.1.

If the MS camps on a GERAN cell as a result of a cell change order from
E-UTRAN (see 3GPP TS 36.331) or redirection from E-UTRAN (see 3GPP TS
36.304), and system information for that cell is provided by the network
in E-UTRAN, the MS may omit to acquire the system information from the
BCCH before establishing a circuit switched connection if the conditions
specified in 3GPP TS 44.018 are met.

For the specific case of CS Fallback by cell change order or redirection
from E-UTRAN, if the MS camps on a suitable cell whose LAI is different
to the one stored in the MS, the MS shall initiate a location updating
or a combined routing area updating procedure as specified in 3GPP TS
24.008.

The times given in subclauses 6.2, 6.3 and 6.6 refer to internal
processes in the MS required to ensure that the MS camps as quickly as
possible to the most appropriate cell.

For the cell selection, the MS shall be able to select the correct
(fourth strongest) cell and be able to respond to paging on that cell
within 30 seconds of switch on, when the three strongest cells are not
suitable. This assumes a valid SIM with PIN disabled and ideal radio
conditions. For an MS that supports EC-GSM-IoT, the allowed time is
\[80\] seconds with all four cells in extended coverage, i.e. received
levels below the input level for BCCH reference performance (i.e. SDCCH
reference performance for a TIGHTER MS for the static channel in Table
1w of 3GPP 45.005) equal to \[-110\] dBm, but above \[-115\] dBm. This
requirement is not applicable for multi-RAT mobile stations.

NOTE: Priorities between different frequencies or RATs provided to the
MS by system information or by dedicated signalling are not used in the
cell selection process.

The tolerance on all the timing requirements in clause 6 is ± 10 %,
except for PENALTY\_TIME where it is ± 2 s.

6.2 Measurements for normal cell selection
------------------------------------------

The measurements of this clause shall be performed by an MS which has no
prior knowledge of which RF channels are BCCH carriers.

The MS shall search all RF channels within its bands of operation, take
readings of received RF signal level on each RF channel, and calculate
the RLA\_C for each. The averaging is based on at least five measurement
samples per RF carrier spread over 3 to 5 s, the measurement samples
from the different RF carriers being spread evenly during this period.

An EC-GSM-IoT capable MS shall perform EC-GSM-IoT cell selection based
on RLA\_EC (see subclause 6.9). In case the MS also supports GPRS
services using GPRS or EGPRS TBFs, non EC-GSM-IoT cell selection shall
be based on RLA\_GC (see subclause 6.9a). Therefore, following the
RLA\_C measurements described above, the MS shall perform a second
search of the RF channels within its bands of operation, and measure:

\- RLA\_EC for the strongest EC-BCCH carrier, out of each RF channel
where an EC-SCH is detected.

\- RLA\_GC for the strongest BCCH carrier on each RF channel where an
EC-SCH is not detected, in case the MS supports GPRS or EGPRS TBFs.

The cell selected by an EC-GSM-IoT capable MS as a result of performing
the cell selection procedure shall be the suitable cell (see 3GPP TS
43.022 \[11\]) with the highest measured value (i.e., RLA\_EC if the MS
does not support GPRS services, highest of RLA\_EC and RLA\_GC if MS
supports GPRS services). When measuring candidate cells during the
selection procedure, RLA\_EC and RLA\_GC measurements may be omitted
(and the corresponding cells not considered for cell selection) for
those candidate cells for which the measured RLA\_C is more than
CELL\_SELECTION\_RLA\_MARGIN dB below the measured RLA\_EC or RLA\_GC of
the best candidate cell identified to that point in the cell selection
procedure. CELL\_SELECTION\_ RLA\_MARGIN is optionally broadcast in EC
SI in cells supporting EC-GSM-IoT, and in SI in cells not supporting
EC-GSM-IoT, see 3GPP TS 44.018 \[17\]. If not broadcast, the default
value shall be used (see table 1 in clause 9).

A multi band MS shall search all channels within its bands of operation
as specified above. The number of channels searched will be the sum of
channels on each band of operation.

BCCH carriers can be identified by, for example, searching for frequency
correction bursts. On finding a BCCH carrier, the MS shall attempt to
synchronize to it and read the BCCH data.

An EC-GSM-IoT capable MS performing measurements for cell selection on
an EC-GSM-IoT capable cell shall search for frequency correction bursts
and synchronization bursts carrying EC-SCH when identifying BCCH
carriers, see subclause 6.9. Before selecting a BCCH carrier, the MS
shall attempt to synchronize to it and read the EC-BCCH data. An
EC-GSM-IoT capable MS attempting to synchronize to a BCCH carrier in
search for an EC-GSM-IoT cell may assume that the cell is a non
EC-GSM-IoT cell if no successful decoding of EC-SCH has been done within
2 s.

The maximum time allowed for synchronization to a BCCH carrier is 0.5 s,
and the maximum time allowed to read the BCCH data, when being
synchronized to a BCCH carrier, is 1.9 s or equal to the scheduling
period for the BCCH data, whichever is greater (see 3GPP TS 45.002). The
MS is allowed to camp on a cell and access the cell after decoding all
relevant BCCH data.

An EC-GSM-IoT capable MS shall be able to synchronize to the BCCH
carrier of an EC-GSM-IoT cell within 2 s at input signal level for
reference performance of EC-BCCH. The maximum time allowed to read the
EC-BCCH data, when being synchronized to a BCCH carrier of an EC-GSM-IoT
cell, is 12 s or equal to the scheduling period for the EC-BCCH data,
whichever is greater (see 3GPP TS 45.002 \[22\]) in ideal radio
conditions. The MS is allowed to camp on an EC-GSM-IoT capable cell and
access the cell after decoding all relevant EC-BCCH data.

6.3 Measurements for stored list cell selection
-----------------------------------------------

The MS may include optional storage of BCCH carrier information when
switched off as detailed in 3GPP TS 43.022. For example, the MS may
store the BCCH carriers in use by the PLMN selected when it was last
active in the network. The BCCH list may include BCCH carriers from more
than one band in a multi band operation PLMN. A MS may also store BCCH
carriers for more than one PLMN which it has selected previously (e.g.
at national borders or when more than one PLMN serves a country), in
which case the BCCH carrier lists must be kept quite separate.

A MS supporting EC-GSM-IoT may store a separate list of BCCH carriers
configured to carry the EC-BCCH.

The stored BCCH carrier information used by the MS may be derived by a
variety of different methods. The MS may use the BA\_RANGE information
element, which, if transmitted in the channel release message (see 3GPP
TS 44.018), indicates ranges of carriers which include the BCCH carriers
in use over a wide area or even the whole PLMN. It should be noted that
the BA(BCCH) list might only contain carriers in use in the vicinity of
the cell on which it was broadcast, and therefore might not be
appropriate if the MS is switched off and moved to a new location.

The BA\_RANGE information element contains the Number of Ranges
parameter (defined as NR) as well as NR sets of parameters RANGEi\_LOWER
and RANGEi\_HIGHER. The MS should interpret these to mean that all the
BCCH carriers of the network have ARFCNs in the following ranges:

> Range*1* = ARFCN(RANGE*1*\_LOWER) to ARFCN(RANGE*1*\_HIGHER);\
> Range*2* = ARFCN(RANGE*2*\_LOWER) to ARFCN(RANGE*2*\_HIGHER);\
> Range*NR* = ARFCN(RANGE*NR*\_LOWER) to ARFCN(RANGE*NR*\_HIGHER).

If RANGEi\_LOWER is greater than RANGEi\_HIGHER, the range shall be
considered cyclic and encompasses carriers with ARFCN from range
RANGEi\_LOWER to 1 023 and from 0 to RANGEi\_HIGHER. If RANGEi\_LOWER
equals RANGEi\_HIGHER then the range shall only consist of the carrier
whose ARFCN is RANGEi\_LOWER.

If an MS includes one or more stored BCCH carrier list(s) of the
selected PLMN it shall perform the same measurements as in subclause 6.2
except that only the BCCH carriers in the list need to be measured.

NOTE: If the selected PLMN is equal to one of the equivalent PLMNs, then
stored list cell selection applies to all equivalent PLMNs.

If stored list cell selection is not successful, then as defined in 3GPP
TS 43.022, normal cell selection shall take place. Since information
concerning a number of channels is already known to the MS, it may
assign high priority to measurements on the strongest carriers from
which it has not previously made attempts to obtain BCCH information,
and omit repeated measurements on the known ones.

6.4 Criteria for cell selection and reselection
-----------------------------------------------

### 6.4.1 C1 path loss criterion

The path loss criterion (see 3GPP TS 43.022 \[11\]) parameter C1 used
for cell selection and reselection by a MS not capable of EC-GSM-IoT is
defined as:

C1 = (A ‑ Max(B,0))

The above parameters are defined in table 6.4-1.

Table 6.4-1: C1 parameters

  ----------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Parameter                     Description
  A \[dB\]                      RLA\_C ‑ RXLEV\_ACCESS\_MIN
  RLA\_C \[dBm\]                Signal level metric as defined in subclause 6.1
  RXLEV\_ACCESS\_MIN \[dBm\]    Minimum received signal level at the MS required for access to the system.
  B \[dB\]                      MS\_TXPWR\_MAX\_CCH + POWER OFFSET -- P
  MS\_TXPWR\_MAX\_CCH \[dBm\]   Maximum TX power level an MS may use when accessing the system until otherwise commanded.
  POWER OFFSET \[dB\]           The power offset to be used in conjunction with the MS\_TXPWR\_MAX\_CCH parameter by the class 3 DCS 1 800 MS. In all other cases POWER\_OFFSET=0.
  P \[dBm\]                     Maximum RF output power of the MS.
  ----------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For an EC-GSM-IoT capable MS C1 is evaluated in two differenct ways,
depending on if the cell supports EC-GSM-IoT or not.

\- For an EC-GSM-IoT capable MS evaluating the path loss criterion for
an EC-GSM-IoT cell C1 is defined as:

C1\_EC = (A\_EC ‑ Max(B\_EC,0))

The above parameters are defined in table 6.4-2.

NOTE 1: When TX diversity (antenna hopping) is active a MS may
underestimate RLA\_EC. This can be compensated for by the network in an
adjustment of the EC\_RXLEV\_ACCESS\_MIN.

NOTE 2: Use of enhanced coverage may be restricted by the network by
having previously signalled that use of enhanced coverage is restricted
(see 3GPP TS 24.008 \[46\]).

### 6.4.2 C2 reselection criterion

The reselection criterion C2 is used for cell reselection only and is,
for MS that are not EC-GSM-IoT capable, defined by:

For PENALTY\_TIME \<\> 11111:

C2 = C1 + CELL\_RESELECT\_OFFSET ‑ TEMPORARY\_OFFSET \* H(PENALTY\_TIME
‑ T)

For PENALTY\_TIME = 11111:

C2 = C1 ‑ CELL\_RESELECT\_OFFSET

where the above parameters are defined in table 6.4-4.

|                                  | the time the cell is placed by   |
|                                  | the MS on the list of strongest  |

+----------------------------------+----------------------------------+

CELL\_RESELECT\_OFFSET, TEMPORARY\_OFFSET, PENALTY\_TIME and
CELL\_BAR\_QUALIFY (see table 1a) are optionally broadcast on the BCCH
of the cell. If the parameters are not broadcast, the default values are
CELL\_BAR\_QUALIFY = 0, and the other parameters shall be set so that C2
= C1.

For an EC-GSM-IoT capable MS, C2 is evaluated in two different ways,
depending on if the cell supports EC-GSM-IoT or not.

\- For an EC-GSM-IoT capable MS evaluating the cell reselection
criterion for a cell capable of EC-GSM-IoT, C2 is defined as:

C2\_EC = RLA\_EC -Max(B\_EC,0) + EC\_CELL\_RESELECT\_OFFSET

The above parameters are defined in table 6.4-5.

Table 6.4-5: C2\_EC parameters

  ---------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Parameter                    Description
  EC\_CELL\_RESELECT\_OFFSET   EC-GSM-IoT specific version of CELL\_RESELECT\_OFFSET. In case not broadcast the parameter should be set to 0.
  ---------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\- For an EC-GSM-IoT capable MS evaluating the cell reselection
criterion for a cell not supporting EC-GSM-IoT, C2 is defined as:

For PENALTY\_TIME \<\> 11111:

C2\_GC = RLA\_GC - Max(B,0) + CELL\_RESELECT\_OFFSET --
TEMPORARY\_OFFSET \* H(PENALTY\_TIME ‑ T)

For PENALTY\_TIME = 11111:

C2\_GC = RLA\_GC -- Max(B,0) -- CELL\_RESELECT\_OFFSET

The use of C2 is described in 3GPP TS 43.022.

These described parameters are used to ensure that the MS is camped on
the cell with which it has the highest probability of successful
communication on uplink and downlink.

### 6.4.3 C4 criteria

The signal strength threshold criterion parameter C4 is used to
determine whether prioritised LSA cell reselection shall apply and is
defined by:

C4 = A - PRIO\_THR

where

A is defined as above and PRIO\_THR is the signal threshold for applying
LSA reselection. PRIO\_THR is broadcast on the BCCH. If the idle mode
support is disabled for the LSA (see 3GPP TS 51.011) or if the cell does
not belong to any LSA to which the MS is subscribed or if no PRIO\_THR
parameter is broadcast, PRIO\_THR shall be set to ∞.

### 6.4.4 Disabling of EC operation

In case a MS in EC operation disables EC operation, a cell reselection
needs to be performed to ensure that the MS finds a suitable cell for
camping. Whenever EC operation is disabled (or enabled) a MS may need to
perform a cell update (see 3GPP TS 44.018 \[17\]).

6.5 Downlink signalling failure
-------------------------------

For a MS in idle mode that has not enabled PEO or EC operation, the
downlink signalling failure criterion is based on the downlink
signalling failure counter DSC. When the MS camps on a cell, DSC shall
be initialized to a value equal to the nearest integer to 90/N where N
is the BS\_PA\_MFRMS parameter for that cell (see 3GPP TS 45.002).
Thereafter, whenever the MS attempts to decode a message in its paging
subchannel; if a message is successfully decoded (BFI = 0) DSC is
increased by 1, however never beyond the initial value, otherwise DSC is
decreased by 4. When DSC ≤ 0, a downlink signalling failure shall be
declared.

An MS in packet idle mode or MAC-Idle state that has not enabled PEO or
EC operation shall follow the same procedure for DSC management. The
counter DSC shall be initialized each time the MS enters packet idle
mode or MAC-Idle state, respectively. In case DRX period split is
supported, DSC shall be initialized to a value equal to the nearest
integer to max(10, 90\* N~DRX~), where N~DRX~ is the average number of
monitored blocks per multiframe in DRX mode according to its paging
group (see 3GPP TS 45.002 \[22\]). In non-DRX mode, the MS shall only
increment/decrement DSC for one block per DRX period according to its
paging group. The exact position of these blocks is not essential, only
the average rate.

A MS that has enabled PEO with eDRX shall, upon entering packet idle
mode, initialize PCH\_DSC to the value indicated by the PEO\_DSC field
of the *SI 13 Rest Octets* IE (see 3GPP TS 44.018 \[17\]). Thereafter,
if the MS successfully decodes a message in its paging subchannel (i.e.
using its nominal paging group) PCH\_DSC is incremented by 1, but not
beyond the initial value. Otherwise, it shall decrement PCH\_DSC by 1
and begin monitoring PCH blocks according to the shortest eDRX cycle
value (i.e. eDRX Cycle Value = 0000, see 3GPP TS 45.002 \[22\]). While
monitoring PCH blocks according to the shortest eDRX cycle value the MS
shall still monitor PCH paging occasions determined by its negotiated
eDRX value. It repeats the process of incrementing/decrementing PCH\_DSC
based on the outcome of each attempted PCH decoding until it either
successfully decodes a PCH/AGCH message at which point it resumes
monitoring only PCH blocks corresponding to its negotiated eDRX Cycle
Value, or PCH\_DSC = 0 at which point a downlink signalling failure
shall be declared. A MS that has enabled PEO shall use a non-DRX mode
period of zero seconds.

NOTE: The network sends the paging subchannel for a given MS every
BS\_PA\_MFRMS multiframes or, in case DRX period split is supported,
every 1/N~DRX~ multiframes. An exception is the case of a MS that is
using eDRX in which case the network sends paging messages using paging
sub-channels as described in 3GPP TS 45.002 \[22\]. The requirement for
network transmission on the paging subchannel is specified in 3GPP
TS 44.018 \[17\] or 3GPP TS 44.060 \[19\]. The MS is required to attempt
to decode a message every time its paging subchannel is sent.

For a MS that has enabled EC operation downlink signalling failure is
declared if the MS fails to decode EC-SCH within 2.5 seconds during an
attempt to synchronize to a cell (i.e. neither DSC nor PEO\_DSC are
used). A MS that has enabled EC operation shall use a non-DRX mode
period of zero seconds.

A downlink signalling failure shall result in the MS performing the cell
reselection procedure (i.e. if a better cell is found it is used).

6.6 Measurements for Cell Reselection
-------------------------------------

### 6.6.0 General

Upon completion of cell selection and when starting the cell
reselection tasks, the MS shall synchronize to and read the BCCH
information for the 6 strongest non‑serving carriers (in the BA) as
quickly as possible within the times specified in subclause 6.6.1. An
exception is the case of a MS that has enabled PEO or EC operation in
which case the MS shall start the cell reselection task based on the
criteria described in sub-clause 6.6.1a. For multi band MSs the
strongest non‑serving carriers may belong to different frequency bands.
If system information message type 2 ter or 2 quater is used in the
serving cell, and the MS has decoded all relevant serving cell BCCH
data, except system information message 2 ter and/or 2 quater, then the
MS shall start cell reselection measurements based on the known part of
the BA, until system information message 2 ter and/or 2 quater is
decoded and the full BA can be used.

MSs supporting SoLSA with SoLSA subscription shall perform cell
re-selection according to subclause 6.6.3. Other MSs shall perform cell
re-selection according to subclause 6.6.2.

MSs supporting other radio access technologies shall also perform
measurements according to subclause 6.6.4 and cell-reselection according
to subclause 6.6.5 or 6.6.6.

### 6.6.1 Monitoring of received signal level and BCCH data

#### 6.6.1.1 Applicability

If a MS has enabled PEO or EC operation then while in idle mode it shall
monitor the received signal level and BCCH data as described in
clause 6.6.1a. Otherwise, whilst in idle mode an MS shall continue to
monitor all BCCH carriers as indicated by the BCCH allocation (BA ‑ See
table 1). An EC-GSM-IoT capable MS that has not enabled PEO or EC
operation (e.g., because it is camping on a cell that does not support
EC-GSM-IoT or PEO) shall monitor the received signal level and BCCH data
as specified below, except that RLA\_C measurements (see subclause
6.6.1.2) shall be replaced by RLA\_EC measurements (see subclause 6.9)
for neighbour cells supporting EC-GSM-IoT, and by RLA\_GC measurements
(see subclause 6.9a) for neighbour cells not supporting EC-GSM-IoT, but
with requirements on number of samples and averaging periods according
to subclause 6.6.1.2.

#### 6.6.1.2 Monitoring of received signal level

A running average of received signal level (RLA\_C) in the preceding 5
to:

Max {5 , ((5 \* N + 6) DIV 7) \* BS\_PA\_MFRMS / 4}

seconds shall be maintained for each carrier in the BCCH allocation. N
is the number of non‑serving cell BCCH carriers in BA and the parameter
BS\_PA\_MFRMS is defined in 3GPP TS 45.002.

The same number of measurement samples shall be taken for all
non‑serving cell BCCH carriers of the BA list, and the samples allocated
to each carrier shall as far as possible be uniformly distributed over
each evaluation period. At least 5 received signal level measurement
samples are required per RLA\_C value. New sets of RLA\_C values shall
be calculated as often as possible.

For the serving cell, received signal level measurement samples shall be
taken at least for each paging block of the MS. The RLA\_C shall be a
running average determined using samples collected over a period of 5 s
to Max {5s, five consecutive paging blocks of that MS}. The samples
shall as far as possible be uniformly distributed over each evaluation
period. At least 5 received signal level measurement samples are
required per RLA\_C value. New RLA\_C values shall be calculated as
often as possible.

The list of the 6 strongest non‑serving carriers shall be updated at
least as often as the duration of the running average defined for
measurements on the BCCH allocation and may be updated more frequently.

In order to minimize power consumption, MS that employ DRX (i.e. power
down when paging blocks are not due) should monitor the received signal
levels of non‑serving cell BCCH carriers during the frames of the paging
block that they are required to listen to. The MS shall include the BCCH
carrier of the current serving cell (i.e. the cell the MS is camped on)
in this measurement routine. Received signal level measurement samples
can thus be taken on several non‑serving cell BCCH carriers and on the
serving carrier during each paging block.

#### 6.6.1.3 Monitoring of BCCH data and BSIC decoding

The MS shall attempt to decode the full BCCH data of the serving cell at
least every 30 seconds or at least as often as possible in the case that
system information scheduling period exceeds 30 seconds. As an
exception, after the first attempt at cell selection, SI15, if used,
shall be decoded at least once every 30 minutes.

If SI13 is broadcast, the MS supporting change mark in SI13 (See 3GPP
TS 44.018) is only required to confirm system information on the BCCH of
the serving cell if indicated by change mark in SI13.

The MS shall attempt to decode the BCCH data block that contains the
parameters affecting cell reselection for each of the 6 strongest
non‑serving cell BCCH carriers at least every 5 minutes, if the
parameters affecting cell reselection have not been provided by the
network in the serving cell.

When the MS recognizes that a new BCCH carrier has become one of the
6 strongest, the BCCH data shall be decoded for the new carrier within
30 seconds, if the information is not already available.

If the network indicates that it supports the SI2n message in the
serving cell, the MS in packet transfer mode or broadcast/multicast
receive mode shall not interrupt data transfer by attempting to
autonomously decode the BCCH data block that contains the parameters
affecting cell reselection, from non-serving cells. However, if relevant
reselection parameters are not received from the serving cell within 30
seconds after reselecting a new cell, the MS shall revert to autonomous
decoding of parameters from non-serving cells.

The MS shall attempt to check the BSIC for each of the 6 strongest
non‑serving cell BCCH carriers at least every 30 seconds, to confirm
that it is monitoring the same cell. If a change of BSIC is detected
then the carrier shall be treated as a new carrier and the BCCH data
re-determined.

For an MS supporting network sharing (see 3GPP TS 44.018 \[17\], 3GPP TS
23.251 \[45\] and 3GPP TS 24.008 \[46\]), only cells with allowed BSIC
shall be considered for reselection. The allowed BSIC is either a valid
BSIC with a permitted NCC part or, for cells in BA(BCCH) where no BSIC
is broadcast, a BSIC with a permitted NCC part (see subclause 7.2).

In addition, an MS supporting SoLSA with SoLSA subscription shall
attempt to decode BSIC and the BCCH data blocks that contain the
parameters affecting SoLSA cell reselection for the 6 strongest
carriers, which are included both in the BCCH allocation and in the
BA\_PREF as received in the latest CHANNEL RELEASE message (see 3GPP
TS 44.018). At least one carrier shall be searched every 5 minutes, one
after another. In the case the MS has been able to decode the BCCH data
blocks, the rules described in subclause 6.6.3 shall be followed.

#### 6.6.1.4 Determination of available PLMNs

When requested by the user, the MS shall determine which PLMNs are
available (Manual Mode) or available and allowable (Automatic Mode) (see
3GPP TS 43.022) within 10 seconds (for GSM 450), 10 seconds (for
GSM 480), 15 seconds (for GSM 700), 15 seconds (for GSM 850, ER-GSM 900
and GSM 900) or 20 seconds (for DCS 1 800 and PCS 1 900). A multi band
MS shall perform the same procedures in all bands of operation within
the sum of time constraints in the respective band of operation.

In both cases, this monitoring shall be done so as to minimize
interruptions to the monitoring of the PCH.

#### 6.6.1.5 Requirements for synchronization and reading of BCCH data

The maximum time allowed for synchronization to a BCCH carrier is 0,5 s,
and the maximum time allowed to read the BCCH data, when being
synchronized to a BCCH carrier, is 1,9 s or equal to the scheduling
period for the BCCH data, whichever is greater (see 3GPP TS 45.002).

### 6.6.1a Reduced Monitoring of received signal level and (EC-)BCCH data

#### 6.6.1a.1 General

A MS that has enabled PEO or EC operation shall, while in packet idle
mode, support relaxed mobility related procedures, i.e., a reduced
monitoring of signal levels and BCCH data (in case of PEO) or EC-BCCH
data (in case of EC operation).

#### 6.6.1a.2 Monitoring of the serving cell

The MS shall perform the following tasks for the serving cell:

\- BSIC confirmation and evaluation of the applicable C1 criterion (see
subclause 6.4.1) for the BCCH carrier of the serving cell shall be
performed before each time the paging block is monitored (i.e. eDRX is
used) or, if the MS supports EC Paging Indication Channel monitoring and
the support of this channel is indicated in EC System Information,
before each time the EC-PICH block is monitored, or each uplink
transmission. However, these evaluations need not be performed more
often than once every 30 seconds. BSIC confirmation is performed on the
(EC-)BCCH carrier of the serving cell which may not be the strongest
cell when PEO or EC operation is enabled.

\- In case of paging block monitoring or, if the MS supports EC Paging
Indication Channel monitoring and the support of this channel is
indicated in EC System Information, in case of monitoring the EC-PICH
block, the MS shall wake up sufficiently in advance so that, in the
event that cell reselection becomes necessary, there will be sufficient
time to complete the cell reselection prior to the paging block
monitoring, or, if the MS supports EC Paging Indication Channel
monitoring and the support of this channel is indicated in EC System
Information, prior to monitoring the EC-PICH block.

\- When evaluating C1, a MS that has enabled PEO shall take received
signal level measurement samples over a period of at least 5 seconds to
establish a running average RLA\_C where the samples shall, as far as
possible, be uniformly distributed over each evaluation period and at
least 5 received signal level measurement samples are required per
RLA\_C value. An EC-GSM-IoT capable MS that has enabled EC operation
shall calculate RLA\_EC as specified in subclause 6.9.

\- The MS shall keep track of two C1 values:

\- C1~a~, the best C1 value experienced in the serving cell since last
performing measurements for cell reselection, or, after cell selection,
since selecting the serving cell; and

\- C1~b~, the most recently evaluated C1 (i.e. the current C1 value)

\- Upon evaluating C1 it determines if the current C1 value (C1~b~) is
less than the best C1 value (C1~a~) by more than C1\_DELTA. C1\_DELTA is
calculated each time measurements for cell re-selection are performed,
see subclause 6.6.1a.4. Measurements for cell re-selection are triggered
if the difference is greater than C1\_DELTA. After cell selection,
C1\_DELTA shall be set to the value of the C1\_DELTA\_MIN parameter sent
in SI13 for PEO or in EC SI 3 for EC operation -- see 3GPP TS 44.018
\[17\].

\- A MS that has enabled PEO shall read the PEO\_BCCH\_CHANGE\_MARK
field when performing the packet access procedure (see 3GPP TS 44.018
\[17\]). If a change of PEO\_BCCH\_CHANGE\_MARK is detected it shall
first read SI13 before proceeding with the packet access procedure. If
no change is detected and the time elapsed since it last read SI13
exceeds 24 hours it shall read SI13 before proceeding with the packet
access procedure. Otherwise, it proceeds with the packet access
procedure without first reading SI13.

\- In addition, if the MS supports deferred system information
acquisition in PEO, the network provides the PEO Idle Mode Mobility Cell
Group definition in SI 13 (see 3GPP TS 44.018 \[17\]), and the cell it
reselects to identifies a cell in the same PEO IMM Cell Group as the
last serving cell and no increment of the change mark of the PEO IMM
Cell Group compared to the one in the last serving cell is detected, it
shall not read BCCH data of that cell prior to monitoring its paging
block on PCH. The conditions when to read BCCH data, after cell
reselection, in the serving cell are specified in 3GPP TS 44.018 \[17\].
In case the network does not provide the PEO IMM Cell Group definition
in SI 13 (see 3GPP TS 44.018 \[17\]), the MS does not apply deferred
system information acquisition in PEO and performs reading of BCCH data
of the serving cell as in normal operation for PEO.

\- A MS that has enabled EC operation shall read the EC-BCCH CHANGE MARK
field in EC-SCH before proceeding with the packet access procedure (see
3GPP TS 44.018 \[17\]). If a change of EC-BCCH CHANGE MARK is detected,
or if the time elapsed since it last read the complete EC SI message set
exceeds 24 hours, the MS shall read EC SI as necessary (see 3GPP TS
44.018 \[17\]) before proceeding with the packet access procedure.
Otherwise, it proceeds with the packet access procedure without first
reading EC SI.

\- In addition, if the MS supports deferred system information
acquisition in EC operation, the network provides the Idle Mode Mobility
Cell Group Definition in EC SI (see 3GPP TS 44.018 \[17\]), and the cell
it reselects to identifies a cell in the same IMM Cell Group as the last
serving cell and no increment of the change mark of the IMM Cell Group
compared to the one in the last serving cell is detected, it shall not
read EC-BCCH data of that cell prior to monitoring the paging block
(EC-PCH) or the corresponding paging indication block (EC-PICH), if
supported by that cell, which it has reselected to. The conditions when
to read EC-BCCH data, after cell reselection, in the serving cell are
specified in 3GPP TS 44.018 \[17\]. In case the network does not provide
the IMM Cell Group Definition in EC SI (see 3GPP TS 44.018 \[17\]), the
MS does not apply deferred system information acquisition in EC
operation and performs reading of EC-BCCH data of the serving cell as in
normal EC operation.

#### 6.6.1a.3 Criteria for triggering measurements for cell re-selection

The MS shall proceed as described in sub-clause 6.6.1a.4 if any of the
following criteria are fulfilled:

\- Cell selection has been completed and monitoring of non-serving cells
for cell reselection has not yet been performed;

\- C1 ≤ 0;

\- A change in BSIC is detected;

\- A downlink signalling failure is declared;

\- C1~a~ -- C1~b~ \> C1\_DELTA, or

\- More than 24 hours have passed since the last evaluation of C1 and C2
of non-serving cells;

\- A MS that has enabled PEO or EC operation and supports the MTA
procedure receives a paging request message that indicates a positioning
event is pending (see 3GPP TS 44.018 and 3GPP TS 43.059) except if a
cell re-selection has been performed within the last \[60\] seconds.

\- A MS for which the use of enhanced coverage was previously
restricted, receives a paging request message that indicates the removed
restriction for use of enhanced coverage (see 3GPP TS 44.018).

The MS need not monitor the BCCH carriers of the non-serving cells as
long as none of these criteria are fulfilled.

#### 6.6.1a.4 Monitoring of non-serving cells

When determining if cell reselection is possible the MS shall first
evaluate RLA\_C, RLA\_EC or RLA\_GC (whichever is applicable) for all
non‑serving BCCH carriers in the BA list and identify the N strongest
(where 3 ≤ N ≤ 6 and N is implementation specific) using samples
collected over a 5 second period.

In case the MS has enabled PEO and does not support deferred system
information acquisition in PEO, and the network does not support
transmission of the SI2n message in the serving cell then the MS shall
also synchronize to and read the BCCH information for the N strongest
non‑serving cell carriers (e.g. to acquire parameters needed for
performing C1 and C2 evaluation and to determine if the cell is barred)
as quickly as possible before determining if cell reselection is
possible.

In case the MS has enabled PEO and supports deferred system information
acquisition in PEO, and the network provides the PEO IMM Cell Group
definition in SI 13 (see 3GPP TS 44.018 \[17\]), the MS shall identify
non-serving cells based on provided broadcast frequencies assigned to
the PEO IMM Cell Group and on BSIC for cells contained in the PEO IMM
Cell Group definition. It shall then synchronize to cells with these
BCCH frequencies and monitor AGCH/PCH messages, in order to determine if
these cells belong to the same PEO IMM Cell Group as the serving cell
and if their PEO IMM Change Mark has the same value as in the serving
cell (see 3GPP TS 44.018 \[17\]). For these cells the MS does not need
to read BCCH data prior to cell reselection.

In case the MS has enabled EC operation and does not support deferred
system information acquisition in EC operation, and the network does not
support transmission of cell reselection related parameters in EC SI in
the serving cell then the MS shall also synchronize to and read the BCCH
information or EC-BCCH information (whichever is applicable) for the N
strongest non-serving cell carriers (e.g. to acquire parameters needed
for performing C1 and C2 evaluation and to determine if the cell is
barred) as quickly as possible before determining if cell reselection is
possible.

In case the MS has enabled EC operation and supports deferred system
information acquisition in EC operation, and the network provides the
IMM Cell Group definition in EC SI (see 3GPP TS 44.018 \[17\]), the MS
shall identify non-serving cells based on provided broadcast frequencies
assigned to the IMM Cell Group and on BSIC for cells contained in the
IMM Cell Group definition. It shall then synchronize to cells with these
BCCH frequencies and read the EC-SCH content in two consecutive EC-SCH
messages sent over 8\*51-multiframes, starting with 51-multiframe N with
N mod 8 = 0, in order to determine if these cells belong to the same IMM
Cell Group as the serving cell and if their IMM Change Mark has the same
value as in the serving cell (see 3GPP TS 44.018 \[17\]). For these
cells the MS does not need to read EC-BCCH data prior to cell
reselection.

For an MS supporting network sharing (see 3GPP TS 44.018 \[17\], 3GPP TS
23.251 \[45\] and 3GPP TS 24.008 \[46\]), only cells with allowed BSIC
shall be considered for reselection. The allowed BSIC is a BSIC with a
permitted NCC part. The permitted NCCs are defined by the NCC\_PERMITTED
parameter transmitted in the BCCH data.

The MS then proceeds as described in subclause 6.6.2.

After performing measurements for cell re-selection (regardless of
whether a cell re-selection has been performed or not), the MS shall
calculate the difference D between the most recent C1 of the serving
cell and the most recent C1 of the strongest (in terms of C1) evaluated
neighbour cell, and update C1\_DELTA as follows:

C1\_DELTA = min( max(D,C1\_DELTA\_MIN) , C1\_DELTA\_MAX )

If no neighbour cell has been found, C1\_DELTA shall be set to
C1\_DELTA\_MAX.

The parameters C1\_DELTA\_MIN and C1\_DELTA\_MAX are sent in SI13 for
PEO and in EC SI 3 for EC operation -- see 3GPP TS 44.018 \[17\].

### 6.6.2 Path loss criteria and timings for cell re‑selection

The MS is required to perform the following measurements (see 3GPP
TS 43.022 \[11\]) to ensure that the path loss criterion to the serving
cell is acceptable.

At least every 5 s the MS shall calculate the value of C1 and C2 for the
serving cell and re‑calculate C1 and C2 values for non serving cells (if
necessary). As an exception, a MS that has enabled PEO or EC operation
shall only perform the calculations of this subclause under conditions
given in subclause 6.6.1a.

The MS shall then check whether:

i\) The path loss criterion (C1) for current serving cell falls below
zero for a period of 5 seconds. This indicates that the path loss to the
cell has become too high.

ii\) The calculated value of C2 for a non‑serving suitable cell exceeds
the value of C2 for the serving cell for a period of 5 seconds, except;

a\) in the case of the new cell being in a different location area or,
for a GPRS attached MS, in a different routing area or always for a GPRS
attached MS in GMM Ready state (*A/Gb mode*) or RRC-Cell\_Shared state
(*Iu mode*) in which case the C2 value for the new cell shall exceed the
C2 value of the serving cell by at least CELL\_RESELECT\_HYSTERESIS dB
as defined by the BCCH data from the current serving cell, for a period
of 5 seconds; or

b\) in case of a cell reselection occurring within the previous
15 seconds in which case the C2 value for the new cell shall exceed the
C2 value of the serving cell by at least 5 dB for a period of 5 seconds.

This indicates that it is a better cell.

If a better cell is available then the MS shall reselect the non-serving
suitable cell with the highest C2 value, synchronize to that cell and
read the BCCH information sent therein. Cell reselection for any other
reason (see 3GPP TS 43.022 \[11\]) shall take place immediately, but the
cell that the MS was camped on shall not be returned to within 5 seconds
if another suitable cell can be found. If valid RLA\_C, or RLA\_EC, or
RLA\_GC values are not available, the MS shall wait until these values
are available and then perform the cell reselection if it is still
required. The MS may accelerate the measurement procedure within the
requirements in subclause 6.6.1 or in case of PEO or EC operation in
subclause 6.6.1a to minimize the cell reselection delay.

If no suitable cell is found within 10 seconds, the cell
selection algorithm of 3GPP TS 43.022 shall be performed. Since
information concerning a number of channels is already known to the MS,
it may assign high priority to measurements on the strongest carriers
from which it has not previously made attempts to obtain BCCH
information, and omit repeated measurements on the known ones.

### 6.6.3 Cell reselection algorithm for SoLSA

At least for every new sample or every second, whichever is the
greatest, the MS calculate the value of C1, C2 and C4 for the serving
cell and the non‑serving cells. The MS shall make a cell reselection if:

i\) The path loss criterion parameter (C1) for the serving cell falls
below zero for a period of 5 seconds.

ii\) A non‑serving suitable cell (see 3GPP TS 43.022 \[11\]) is
evaluated to be better than the serving cell for a period of 5 seconds.
The best cell is

> \- the cell with the highest value of C2 + LSA\_OFFSET among those
> cells that have highest LSA priority among those that fulfil the
> criteria C4 ≥ 0, or
>
> \- the cell with the highest value of C2 among all cells, if no cell
> fulfil the criterion C4 ≥ 0.
>
> LSA\_OFFSET is broadcast on BCCH. If no LSA\_OFFSET parameter is
> broadcast, LSA\_OFFSET shall be set to 0.
>
> LSA priority is defined by the list of LSAs for the subscriber stored
> on the SIM (see 3GPP TS 51.011 \[34\]). LSAs are identified by LSA
> ID(s), Cell Identity and/or Location Area Identity broadcast on BCCH.
> Cells not belonging to this list are given LSA priority lower than 0.
>
> When evaluating the best cell, the following hysteresis values shall
> be subtracted from the C2 value for the neighbour cells:

\- if the new cell is in the same location area: 0;

\- if the new cell is in a different location area:\
CELL\_RESELECT\_HYSTERESIS, which is broadcast on BCCH of the serving
cell.

\- in case of a cell reselection occurred within the previous 15
seconds: 5 dB.

Cell reselection for any other reason (see 3GPP TS 43.022 \[11\]) shall
take place immediately, but the cell that the MS was camped on shall not
be returned to within 5 seconds if another suitable cell can be found.
If valid receive level averages are not available, the MS shall wait
until these values are available and then perform the cell reselection
if it is still required. The MS may accelerate the measurement procedure
within the requirements in subclause 6.6.1 to minimise the cell
reselection delay.

If no suitable cell is found within 10 seconds, the cell
selection algorithm of 3GPP TS 43.022 \[11\] shall be performed. Since
information concerning a number of channels is already known to the MS,
it may assign high priority to measurements on the strongest carriers
from which it has not previously made attempts to obtain BCCH
information, and omit repeated measurements on the known ones.

### 6.6.4 Measurements on cells of other radio access technologies

For a multi-RAT MS, cells or frequencies with other radio access
technologies (excluding E-UTRA) may be included in 3G Cell Reselection
list (see 3GPP TS 44.018 \[17\]). If cell reselection based on ranking
is used, the network controls the measurements for reselection of these
cells by the parameter Qsearch\_I broadcast on BCCH. Qsearch\_I defines
a threshold and also indicates whether these measurements shall be
performed when RLA\_C (see subclause 6.6.1) of the serving cell is below
or above the threshold. These measurements may be performed less
frequently than measurements of GSM cells as described in
subclause 6.6.1, in order to conserve MS power.

For a multi-RAT MS supporting E-UTRA, E-UTRAN frequencies may be
included in the E-UTRAN Neighbour Cell list (see 3GPP TS 44.018 \[17\]).
The network controls the measurements for reselection of E-UTRA cells by
the parameter THRESH\_priority\_search broadcast on BCCH. This parameter
also controls measurement of inter-RAT cells or frequencies included in
the 3G Cell Reselection list when the inter-RAT cell reselection
algorithm based on priority information is used (see subclause 6.6.6).
The mobile station shall monitor cells of inter-RAT frequencies of
higher priority than the serving cell. When RLA\_C of the serving cell
is below THRESH\_priority\_search, the mobile station shall monitor
cells of inter-RAT frequencies of lower priority than the serving cell.
When RLA\_C (see subclause 6.6.1) of the serving cell is above the
threshold, the mobile station is allowed not to monitor cells of
inter-RAT frequencies of lower priority than the serving cell.

The MS shall perform the measurement processes for E-UTRAN and other
access technologies in parallel when applicable.

A UTRAN capable MS shall be able to identify and select a new best UTRAN
cell on a frequency, which is part of the 3G Cell Reselection list,
within 30 seconds (in case of cell reselection based on cell ranking) or
25+T\_reselection seconds (in case of cell reselection based on priority
information, if the UTRAN frequency has lower priority than the serving
cell and if RLA\_C of the serving cell is below
THRESH\_priority\_search) after it has been activated under the
condition that there is only one UTRAN frequency in the list (and no
E-UTRAN frequencies in the E-UTRAN Neighbour Cell list) and that no new
GSM cells are activated at the same time and under good radio
conditions. As an exception, the time is increased to
70+T\_reselectionseconds in case of a UTRAN capable MS performing cell
reselection based on priority information (see subclause 6.6.6) if the
UTRAN frequency has higher priority than the serving cell. A E-UTRAN
capable MS shall be able to identify and select a new best E-UTRAN cell
on a frequency, which is part of the E-UTRAN Neighbour Cell list, within
25+T\_reselection seconds after it has been activated if the frequency
has lower priority than the serving cell and if RLA\_C of the serving
cell is below THRESH\_priority\_search, or within 70+T\_reselection
seconds after it has been activated if the frequency has higher priority
than the serving cell, under the condition that there is only one
E-UTRAN frequency in the list (and no UTRAN frequencies in the 3G Cell
Reselection list) and that no new GSM cells are activated at the same
time and under good radio conditions. For test purposes the following
radio conditions can be used: Serving GSM cell at RXLEV= -70 dBm, with 6
GSM neighbours at RXLEV= -75 dBm. Then either an UTRAN FDD neighbour
cell or an UTRAN TDD neighbour cell or an E-UTRAN FDD neighbour cell or
an E-UTRAN TDD neighbour cell is switched on. The radio conditions for
the UTRAN FDD cell are as follows (see 3GPP TS 25.101 \[5\] for
definitions):

NOTE: The parameters in the table above are valid if
THRESH\_E-UTRAN\_high\_Q is not signalled.

The allowed time is increased

\- by 30 seconds for each additional UTRAN frequency in the 3G Cell
Reselection list when the reselection algorithm based on ranking is
used, or

\- by 30 seconds for each additional UTRAN frequency of lower priority
in the 3G Cell Reselection list when the reselection algorithm based on
priority information is used or for each additional E-UTRAN frequency of
lower priority in the E-UTRAN Neighbour Cell list under the condition
that RLA\_C of the serving cell is below THRESH\_priority\_search, or

\- by 70 seconds for each additional UTRAN frequency of higher priority
in the 3G Cell Reselection list when the reselection algorithm based on
priority information is used or for each additional E-UTRAN frequency of
higher priority in the E-UTRAN Neighbour Cell list.

However, multiple UTRAN cells on the same frequency in the 3G Cell
Reselection list does not increase the allowed time.

NOTE: The requirements above assume that only one of the frequencies in
the 3G Cell Reselection list or in the E-UTRAN Neighbour Cell list is
switched on.

A multi-RAT MS shall be able to monitor cells from other radio access
technologies, divided into (depending on the MS capability):

\- UTRAN FDD cells on up to 3 FDD frequencies, with a maximum of 32
cells per frequency; and/or\
- UTRAN TDD cells on up to 3 TDD frequencies with a maximum of 32 cells
per frequency; and/or\
- E-UTRAN FDD cells on up to 3 FDD frequencies; and/or\
- E-UTRAN TDD cells on up to 3 TDD frequencies.

The total number of monitored UTRAN cells shall not exceed 64.

*An MS supporting E-UTRAN measurements shall be capable of monitoring a
minimum total of 7 other RAT carrier frequency layers, comprising of
any* above defined *combination of E-UTRAN FDD, E-UTRAN TDD, UTRAN FDD
and UTRAN TDD layers.*

The MS shall be capable of performing RSCP and Ec/No measurements of at
least 4 best UTRAN cells per UTRAN frequency and RSRP and RSRQ
measurements of at least 4 best E-UTRAN cells per E-UTRAN frequency,
according to its supported capabilities.

The MS shall attempt to read and store UTRAN predefined configurations
using the rules defined in 3GPP TS 25.331 \[9\] with the following
exceptions:

\- The MS shall build a list of at most 16 predefined configurations,
read from the BCCH of the identified UTRAN cells of equivalent PLMNs.

\- After PLMN selection (see 3GPP TS 23.122 \[4\]), the MS shall delete
any old list of predefined configurations and as soon as possible
attempt to read the predefined configurations from one identified UTRAN
cell of the selected PLMN or of an equivalent PLMN.

\- The MS shall attempt to update the list of predefined configurations
every 60 minutes.

In case of a conflict with GSM tasks, the GSM tasks take precedence.

NOTE: Instead of reading new predefined configurations from a PLMN, the
MS may use previously received predefined configurations for that PLMN
according to the rules in 3GPP TS 25.331 \[9\].

The MS shall report the list of predefined configurations in the UTRAN
CLASSMARK CHANGE message (see 3GPP TS 44.018 \[17\]).

If the MS has no or an empty CSG Whitelist and information about PSC/PCI
split information for UTRAN/EUTRAN frequencies is available, the MS
shall disable the measurement of the cells on the frequencies with
PSC/PCI in the stored range \"CSG PSC/PCI Split Information\".

If the MS has no or an empty CSG Whitelist and information about
dedicated frequencies for UTRAN/EUTRAN is available, the MS shall
disable the measurement for cells on dedicated CSG frequencies.

### 6.6.5 Algorithm for cell re‑selection from GSM to UTRAN based on cell ranking

The algorithm in this subclause shall be used for reselection from GSM
to UTRAN if the conditions for the use of the cell reselection algorithm
based on priority information (see subclause 6.6.6) are not satisfied.

If the 3G Cell Reselection list includes UTRAN frequencies, the MS
shall, at least every 5 s update the value RLA\_C for the serving cell
and each of the at least 6 strongest non serving GSM cells.

The MS shall then reselect a suitable (see 3GPP TS 25.304 \[8\]) UTRAN
cell if:

\- for a TDD cell the measured RSCP value is equal to or greater than
TDD\_Qoffset for a period of 5 s and

\- for an FDD cell the following criteria are all met for a period of 5
s:

1\) its measured RSCP value exceeds the value of RLA\_C for the serving
cell and all of the suitable (see 3GPP TS 43.022 \[11\]) non-serving GSM
cells by the value FDD\_Qoffset,

2\) its measured Ec/No value is equal or greater than the value
FDD\_Qmin - FDD\_Qmin\_Offset, and

3\) its measured RSCP value is equal to or greater than
FDD\_RSCP\_threshold.

In case of a cell reselection occurring within the previous 15 seconds,
FDD\_Qoffset or TDD\_Qoffset is increased by 5 dB.

\- Ec/No and RSCP are the measured quantities, see subclause 8.1.5.

\- FDD\_RSCP\_threshold equals FDD\_RSCPmin -- min((P\_MAX -- 21 dBm), 3
dB) if FDD\_RSCPmin is broadcast on the serving cell, else
Qrxlevmin + Pcompensation + 10 dB, if these parameters are available,
otherwise the default value of FDD\_RSCPmin.

\- Qrxlevmin is the minimum required RX level in the UTRAN FDD cell
(dBm), see 3GPP TS 25.304 \[8\].

\- Pcompensation is max(UE\_TXPWR\_MAX\_RACH -- P\_MAX, 0) (dB), see
3GPP TS 25.304 \[8\].

\- UE\_TXPWR\_MAX\_RACH is the maximum TX power level an MS may use when
accessing the UTRAN FDD cell on RACH (dBm), see 3GPP TS 25.304.

\- P\_MAX is the maximum RF output power of the MS (dBm) in UTRAN FDD
mode, see 3GPP TS 25.304 \[8\].

\- FDD\_Qmin, FDD\_Qoffset and optionally FDD\_RSCPmin and
FDD\_Qmin\_Offset are broadcast on BCCH of the serving cell.

\- TDD\_Qoffset is broadcast on BCCH of the serving cell.

Note 1: The parameters required to determine if the UTRAN cell is
suitable are broadcast on BCCH of the UTRAN cell. An MS may start
reselection towards the UTRAN cell before decoding the BCCH of the UTRAN
cell, leading to a short interruption of service if the UTRAN cell is
not suitable.

Note 2: If FDD\_RSCPmin is broadcast, optimum GSM to UTRAN reselection
performance is achieved if UTRAN cells at UTRAN coverage border areas
are planned for +24 dBm UE power.

Note 3: The parameter TDD\_Qoffset is an absolute threshold for
reselection towards a target UTRAN TDD cell.

The MS shall store the UTRAN cell RSCP suitability criterion parameters
above, whenever decoded from a UTRAN FDD cell, which is not a CSG cell,
of a PLMN which is the registered PLMN or is in the stored list of
equivalent PLMNs (see 3GPP TS 24.008 \[46\]) while attempting to camp on
the UTRAN FDD cell. The mobile station shall store, along with decoded
RSCP suitability parameters, the frequency of the cell from which they
were decoded. The most recently stored parameters from a UTRAN FDD cell
(other than a CSG cell) of an equivalent PLMN (including the registered
PLMN) operating on the same frequency as the candidate cell are valid
reselection criteria towards any candidate UTRAN FDD cell evaluated
using the algorithm in this sub-clause. This list of parameters shall be
cleared after PLMN selection (see 3GPP TS 23.122 \[4\]).

Cell reselection to UTRAN shall not occur within 5 seconds after the MS
has reselected a GSM cell from an UTRAN cell if a suitable GSM cell can
be found.

In case of a reselection attempt towards a barred UTRAN cell, the MS
shall abandon further reselection attempts towards this UTRAN cell as
defined by the T~barred~ value on the barred UTRAN cell (see 3GPP TS
25.331 \[9\]).

In case the highest ranked UTRAN cell is not suitable (see 3GPP TS
25.304 \[8\]) due to being part of the \"list of forbidden LAs for
roaming\" or belonging to a PLMN which is not indicated as being
equivalent to the registered PLMN, the MS may abandon further
reselection attempts towards this UTRAN cell and all other cells on the
same frequency, for a period of up to 20 min. If the MS has to perform
cell selection, this limitation shall be removed. If the MS is
redirected under GERAN control to a frequency for which the timer is
running, any limitation on that frequency shall be removed.

If more than one UTRAN cell fulfils the above criteria, the MS shall
select the cell with the greatest RSCP value.

### 6.6.6 Algorithm for inter-RAT cell re-selection based on priority information

A mobile station supporting E-UTRAN shall support priority based
inter-RAT cell re-selection towards all the supported RATs. A mobile
station not supporting E-UTRAN and supporting UTRAN and supporting
priority based reselection from UTRAN to GERAN (see 3GPP TS 25.306
\[47\]) shall support priority based inter-RAT cell re-selection towards
UTRAN.

The algorithm in this sub-clause shall be used for inter-RAT cell
reselection if the following conditions are satisfied:

\- the mobile station supports priority based inter-RAT cell
re-selection, and

\- the mobile station has received the Serving Cell Priority Parameters
Description IE (see 3GPP TS 44.018 \[17\] and 3GPP TS 44.060 \[19\]) for
the serving cell.

If one or both of these conditions are not met, then inter-RAT
reselection to E-UTRAN cells is not permitted, and inter-RAT reselection
to UTRAN cells shall use the algorithm specified in sub-clause 6.6.5.

The set of valid priorities to be used for this algorithm is specified
in 3GPP TS 44.018 \[17\] and 3GPP TS 44.060 \[19\] Cells belonging to
frequencies for which no valid priority is available or no threshold is
provided by the serving cell shall not be considered for measurement and
for cell re-selection.

NOTE 1: The network may enable priority based reselection by providing
in the serving cell at least the Serving Cell Priority Parameters
Description struct and priority information (threshold and priority) for
each inter-RAT frequency in the neighbour cell list to which the
possibility of reselection by a mobile station using this algorithm is
desired (whether or not such cells support priority-based reselection).

NOTE 2: Throughout the specification, the phrase \"neighbour cell list\"
will include also the E-UTRAN Neighbour Cell list where appropriate.

NOTE 3: void

If the 3G Cell Reselection list or the E-UTRAN Neighbour Cell list
include frequencies of other radio access technologies, the MS shall, at
least every 5 s update the value RLA\_C for the serving cell and each of
the at least 6 strongest non serving GSM cells.

The MS shall then reselect a suitable (see 3GPP TS 25.304 \[8\] for
UTRAN and 3GPP TS 36.304 \[40\] for E-UTRAN) cell of another radio
access technology if the criteria below are satisfied.
S\_non-serving\_XXX is the measurement quantity of a non-serving
inter-RAT cell and XXX indicates the other radio access technology/mode
and is defined as follows:

\- for a UTRAN cell, is the measured RSCP value for the cell minus
UTRAN\_QRXLEVMIN for the cell's frequency;

\- for a E-UTRAN cell, is the measured RSRP value for the cell minus
E-UTRAN\_QRXLEVMIN for the cell's frequency if THRESH\_E-UTRAN\_high\_Q
is not provided; otherwise, if THRESH\_E-UTRAN\_high\_Q is provided, is
the measured RSRQ value for the cell minus E-UTRAN\_QQUALMIN for the
cell's frequency.

For a GSM cell, S\_GSM is defined as the C1 value for the cell (see
subclause 6.4);

Cell reselection to a cell of another inter-RAT frequency shall be
performed if any of the conditions below (to be evaluated in the order
shown) is satisfied:

\- The S\_non-serving\_XXX of one or more cells of a higher priority
inter-RAT frequency is greater than THRESH\_XXX\_high (or, in case of an
E-UTRAN target, THRESH\_E-UTRAN\_high\_Q, if provided) during a time
interval T\_reselection; in that case, the mobile station shall consider
the cells for reselection in decreasing order of priority and, for cells
of the same priority, in decreasing order of S\_non-serving\_XXX, and
reselect the first cell that satisfies the conditions above;

\- The value of S\_GSM is lower than THRESH\_GSM\_low for the serving
cell and all measured GSM cells during a time interval T\_reselection;
in this case, the mobile station shall consider for reselection the
inter-RAT cells in the following order, and reselect the first one that
satisfies the following criteria:

\- cells of a lower priority inter-RAT frequency whose
S\_non-serving\_XXX is greater than THRESH\_XXX\_low (or, in case of an
E-UTRAN target, THRESH\_E-UTRAN\_low\_Q, if provided) during a time
interval T\_reselection; these cells shall be considered in decreasing
order of priority and, for cells of the same priority, in decreasing
order of S\_non-serving\_XXX;

\- if no cells satisfy the criterion above, inter-RAT cells for which,
during a time interval T\_reselection, S\_non-serving\_XXX is higher
than S\_GSM for the serving cell by at least a specific hysteresis
*H\_PRIO*; these cells shall be considered in decreasing order of
S\_non-serving\_XXX.

A UTRAN FDD cell shall only be reselected if, in addition to the
criteria above, its measured Ec/No value is equal to or greater than
FDD\_Qmin - FDD\_Qmin\_Offset.

If E-UTRAN\_Qmin is provided for a E-UTRAN frequency, a E-UTRAN cell on
that frequency shall only be reselected if, in addition to the criteria
above, its measured RSRQ value is equal to or greater than
E-UTRAN\_Qmin.

If THRESH\_E-UTRAN\_high\_Q is provided for a E-UTRAN frequency, and if
E-UTRAN\_RSRPmin is provided, a E-UTRAN cell on that frequency shall
only be reselected if, in addition to the criteria above, its measured
RSRP value is equal to or greater than E-UTRAN\_RSRPmin. If
E-UTRAN\_RSRPmin is not provided, the default value shall be used.

If the MS does not support RSRQ based reselection from E-UTRAN (see 3GPP
TS 36.304 \[40\]), cell reselection from GERAN to E-UTRAN shall be based
on the RSRP criterion according to the rules above without considering
THRESH\_E-UTRAN\_high\_Q (i.e. as in the case when
THRESH\_E-UTRAN\_high\_Q is not provided).

E-UTRAN cells which are included in the list of not allowed cells shall
not be considered as candidates for cell reselection. If the strongest
cells on a E-UTRAN frequency are included in the list of not allowed
cells, the mobile station may reselect the strongest valid cell (see
subclause 8.4.7) on that frequency.

Cell reselection to a cell of another radio access technology (e.g.
UTRAN or E-UTRAN) shall not occur within 5 seconds after the MS has
reselected a GSM cell from an inter-RAT cell if a suitable GSM cell can
be found.

If a mobile station in *camped normally* state (see 3GPP TS 43.022
\[11\]) has valid individual priorities which do not include a priority
for the serving cell, the mobile station shall consider the serving cell
to have lowest priority (i.e. lower than the eight network configured
values).

A mobile station in *camped on* *any cell* state (see 3GPP TS 43.022
\[11\]) shall ignore individual priorities received through dedicated
signalling and shall apply priorities received from the system
information of the serving cell while attempting to find a suitable
cell. If the mobile station supports CS voice services, the MS shall
avoid reselecting acceptable (but not suitable) E-UTRA cells regardless
of the priorities provided in system information.

NOTE 4: If the MS is camping on an acceptable cell, individual
priorities are not discarded until an event leading to their deletion
occurs.

In case of a reselection attempt towards a barred UTRAN cell, the MS
shall abandon further reselection attempts towards this UTRAN cell as
defined by the T~barred~ value on the barred UTRAN cell (see 3GPP TS
25.331 \[9\]).

In case of a reselection attempt towards a barred E-UTRAN cell, the MS
shall abandon further reselection attempts towards this E-UTRAN cell for
a period of up to 20 min.

In case the MS attempts reselection to a UTRAN cell which is not
suitable (see 3GPP TS 25.304 \[8\]) due to being part of the \"list of
forbidden LAs for roaming\" or belonging to a PLMN which is not
indicated as being equivalent to the registered PLMN, the MS may abandon
further reselection attempts towards this UTRAN cell and all other cells
on the same frequency, for a period of up to 20 min. If the MS has to
perform cell selection, this limitation shall be removed. If the MS is
redirected under GERAN control to a frequency for which the timer is
running, any limitation on that frequency shall be removed.

In case the MS attempts reselection to a E-UTRAN cell which is not
suitable (see 3GPP TS 36.304 \[40\]) due to being part of the \"list of
forbidden tracking areas for roaming\" (see 3GPP TS 24.301 \[43\]), and
if the MS has received the PCID to TA Mapping information element (see
3GPP TS 44.018 \[17\] and 3GPP TS 44.060 \[19\]) for the frequency of
the cell, it shall abandon further reselection attempts towards this
E-UTRAN cell and any E-UTRAN cell which is known to belong to the same
Tracking Area until the PCID to TA Mapping information changes in the
serving cell or until cell reselection occurs. If the mobile station has
not received the PCID to TA Mapping information element for the
frequency of the cell, the MS may abandon further reselection attempts
towards this E-UTRAN cell and all other cells on the same frequency, for
a period of up to 20 min. If the MS has to perform cell selection, this
limitation shall be removed. If the MS is redirected under GERAN control
to a frequency for which the timer is running, any limitation on that
frequency shall be removed.

In case the MS attempts reselection to a E-UTRAN cell which is not
suitable (see 3GPP TS 36.304 \[40\]) due to belonging to a PLMN which is
not indicated as being equivalent to the registered PLMN, the MS may
abandon further reselection attempts towards this E-UTRAN cell and all
other cells on the same frequency, for a period of up to 20 min. If the
MS has to perform cell selection, this limitation shall be removed. If
the MS is redirected under GERAN control to a frequency for which the
timer is running, any limitation on that frequency shall be removed.

The MS shall store the UTRAN cell RSCP suitability criterion parameters
specified in sub-clause 6.6.5, whenever decoded from a UTRAN FDD cell of
a PLMN in the stored list of equivalent PLMNs (see 3GPP TS 24.008
\[46\]) while attempting to reselect to a UTRAN FDD cell as part of the
priority-based reselection algorithm. Stored RSCP suitability criteria
shall not be used to evaluate the suitability of a UTRAN cell when
evaluating a cell for reselection using the priority-based reselection
algorithm.

### 6.6.7 Cell selection and re-selection to CSG cells and hybrid cells

#### 6.6.7.1 Cell re-selection to CSG cells

If a mobile station is a member of at least one Closed Subscriber Group,
i.e. at least one CSG ID and its PLMN ID is included in the MS's CSG
Whitelist**, then,** in addition to normal cell reselection, the MS
shall use an autonomous search function to detect UTRAN and/or E-UTRAN
CSG cells. The autonomous search function shall at least detect
previously visited allowed CSG cells.

NOTE 1: The autonomous search function is implementation dependent and
controls when and/or where to search for allowed CSG cells.

NOTE 1a: (void).

NOTE 2: (void).

NOTE 3: (void).

If the strongest cell (see 3GPP TS 25.304 \[8\] and 3GPP TS 36.304
\[40\] for the definition of the strongest cell) which the MS has
detected on a UTRAN or E-UTRAN frequency during a time interval
T\_reselection is a suitable CSG cell (see 3GPP TS 25.304 \[8\] and 3GPP
TS 36.304 \[40\] for suitability criteria for UTRAN and E-UTRAN CSG
cells respectively), the MS shall reselect to this cell irrespective of
the cell reselection rules applicable for the cell on which the MS is
currently camped.

The following requirements are valid for reselection to allowed CSG
cells previously visited by the MS when the radio configuration
parameters, including the carrier frequency and PSC/PCI (whichever and
if it is applicable) of the CSG cell, non CSG cell and other neighbour
cells, are unchanged from the most recent previous visit. The autonomous
search and cell re-selection to a previously visited allowed CSG cell
shall meet the performance requirements defined as follows:

\- the MS shall perform search and re-selection to a previously visited
allowed UTRAN FDD CSG cell, that has met the CSG cell re-selection
criterion defined above, within 6 minutes in the radio conditions
specified for an UTRAN FDD CSG cell in 3GPP TS 36.133 \[39\] in terms of
parameters for CSG inter-RAT UTRAN FDD reselection; UARFCN and PSC shall
be unchanged from the most recent previous visit of the UTRAN FDD CSG
cell; Serving GSM cell at RXLEV= -70 dBm, with 6 GSM neighbours at
RXLEV= -75 dBm;

\- the MS shall perform search and re-selection to a previously visited
allowed E-UTRAN CSG cell, that has met the CSG cell re-selection
criterion defined above, within 6 minutes in the radio conditions
specified for an E-UTRAN CSG cell in 3GPP TS 25.133 \[7\] in terms of
parameters for CSG inter-RAT E-UTRA reselection; E-UARFCN and PCI shall
be unchanged from the most recent previous visit of the E-UTRAN CSG
cell; Serving GSM cell at RXLEV= -70 dBm, with 6 GSM neighbours at
RXLEV= -75 dBm.

NOTE 4: The above performance requirements are minimum requirements
defined to ensure the testability of autonomous CSG search.

The MS shall disable the autonomous search function for CSG cells if the
MS has no CSG Whitelist or the MS's CSG Whitelist is empty.

When the MS has no or an empty CSG Whitelist, and the MS has stored
\"CSG PSC Split Information\" or \"CSG PCI Split Information\", the MS
shall ignore for measurement and cell re-selection cells known to be CSG
cells, i.e.:

\- cells on a UTRAN frequency with PSC in the stored range \"CSG PSC
Split Information\" for that frequency (see 3GPP TS 25.331 \[9\]);

\- cells on an E-UTRAN frequency with PCI in the stored range \"CSG PCI
Split Information\" for that frequency (see 3GPP TS 36.331 \[41\]).

In addition, when the MS has no or an empty CSG Whitelist, the MS may
ignore for measurement and cell re-selection cells known to be CSG cells
according to implementation specific means on a frequency for which no
\"CSG PCI Split Information\" or \"CSG PSC Split Information\" is
stored.

The network may provide information about dedicated UTRAN CSG
frequencies and/or dedicated E-UTRAN CSG frequencies. In this case, the
MS may use the autonomous search function only on these dedicated
frequencies and on the other frequencies listed in the system
information. When the MS has no or an empty CSG Whitelist, the MS shall
ignore those frequencies for measurement and cell re-selection.

A mobile station which has an \"Allowed CSG list\" which is not empty
shall not use stored RSCP parameters to evaluate a candidate UTRAN FDD
CSG cell for reselection, unless those (stored) parameters were obtained
from a CSG cell with the same physical layer identifiers (frequency and
PSC).

The mobile station which has an \"Allowed CSG list\" which is not empty
may store the UTRAN cell RSCP suitability criterion parameters from a
UTRAN FDD CSG cell; in this case, these stored parameters shall be
stored separately from parameters stored as specified in sub-clauses
6.6.5 and 6.6.6 and may only be used subsequently to evaluate a
candidate CSG cell with the same physical layer identifiers.

#### 6.6.7.1a Cell re-selection to hybrid cells

If a mobile station is a member of at least one Closed Subscriber Group
then, in addition to normal cell reselection, the MS shall use an
autonomous search function to detect hybrid cells. The autonomous search
function shall at least detect previously visited hybrid cells whose CSG
IDs are included in the CSG Whitelist of the MS.

NOTE: The autonomous search for hybrid cells does not imply that the MS
needs to constantly check the CSG IDs of all cells it sees, and the
impact on battery consumption should be minimised.

If a neighbour cell has been detected as a hybrid cell and the CSG ID of
the hybrid cell is included in the CSG Whitelist of the MS, reselection
to that cell shall follow the rules for CSG cells in subclause 6.6.7.1.
Otherwise normal cell reselection rules (see subclause 6.6.5 and 6.6.6)
shall apply.

#### 6.6.7.2 Manual CSG ID selection

If NAS requests AS to search for available CSG IDs, the MS shall perform
the search and report the results to NAS as described in 3GPP TS 25.304
\[8\] for UTRAN and as described in 3GPP TS 36.304 \[40\] for E-UTRAN.

If a CSG ID is manually selected by NAS, the MS shall behave as
specified in 3GPP TS 25.304 \[8\] or in 3GPP TS 36.304 \[40\], depending
on the RAT type of the selected CSG cell.

6.7 Release of TCH, SDCCH and DBPSCH
------------------------------------

### 6.7.1 Normal case

In *A/Gb mode*, when the MS releases all TCHs or SDCCH and returns to
idle mode, packet idle mode or MAC-Idle state, it shall, as quickly as
possible, camp on the cell whose channel has just been released.
Similarly in *Iu mode*, when the MS releases all DBPSCHs and returns to
MAC-Idle state, it shall, as quickly as possible, camp on the cell whose
channel has just been released. However, in both modes (*A/Gb mode* or
*Iu mode*), if the CHANNEL RELEASE message contains a \"cell selection
indicator after release of all TCH and SDCCH\" or \"Individual
priorities\" (see TS 44.018), the MS shall as quickly as possible camp
on an indicated GSM, UTRAN or E-UTRAN cell that has been identified by
the CHANNEL RELEASE message. If UTRAN or E-UTRAN frequency only is
indicated the MS shall as quickly as possible camp on a suitable cell of
this frequency.

In case the \"cell selection indicator after release of all TCHs and
SDCCH\" or \"Individual priorities\" is not present, then if the full
(P)BCCH data for that cell was not decoded in the preceding 30s, the MS
shall attempt to decode the full (P)BCCH data. Until the MS has decoded
the (P)BCCH data required for determining the paging group, it shall
also monitor all paging blocks on timeslot 0 of the BCCH carrier or, for
GPRS if PCCCH exists and for *Iu mode*, on the PDCH indicated on BCCH
for possible paging messages that might address it. If the MS receives a
page before having decoded the full (P)BCCH data for the cell, the MS
shall store the page and respond once the relevant (P)BCCH data has been
decoded, provided that the cell is not barred and the MS\'s access class
is allowed. Reception of full BCCH(BA) information is not required
before responding to the page.

If the CHANNEL RELEASE does not contain a \"cell selection indicator
after release of all TCH and SDCCH\" or \"Individual priorities\", and
the MS has the knowledge that the cell whose channel is being released
is not suitable (see 3GPP TS 43.022 \[11\]), the MS is allowed to camp
on any suitable cell.

If the CHANNEL RELEASE contains a \"cell selection indicator after
release of all TCH and SDCCH\" or \"Individual priorities\" and

\- the MS cannot find a suitable cell from the indicated ones within 10
s, or

\- none of the indicated cells are suitable,

the MS is allowed to camp on any suitable cell.

NOTE: The received signal level measurements on surrounding cells made
during the last 5 seconds on the TCH or SDCCH in *A/Gb mode*, or on the
DBPSCH in *Iu mode*, may be averaged and used, where possible, to speed
up the process. However, it should be noted that the received signal
level monitoring while on the TCH or SDCCH in *A/Gb mode*, or on the
DBPSCH in *Iu mode*, is on carriers in BA (SACCH), while the carriers to
be monitored for cell reselection are in BA (BCCH) or BA (GPRS).

After decoding the relevant (P)BCCH data the MS shall perform cell
reselection as specified in 3GPP TS 43.022 \[11\].

### 6.7.2 Call re‑establishment

In the event of a radio link failure, call re‑establishment may be
attempted on a GSM cell (according to the procedure in 3GPP TS 44.018
\[17\]). The MS shall perform the following algorithm to determine which
cell to use for the call re‑establishment attempt.

i\) The received signal level measurement samples taken on the carriers
indicated in the BA (SACCH) received on the serving cell and on the
serving cell BCCH carrier in the last 5 seconds shall be averaged, and
the carrier with the highest average received signal level with a
permitted NCC as indicated on the SACCH of the serving cell (see
subclause 7.2) shall be taken.

ii\) On this carrier the MS shall attempt to decode the BCCH data block
containing the parameters affecting cell selection.

iii\) If the cell is suitable (see 3GPP TS 43.022 \[11\]) and call
re‑establishment is allowed, call re‑establishment shall be attempted on
this cell.

iv\) If the MS is unable to decode the BCCH data block or if the
conditions in iii) are not met, the carrier with the next highest
average received signal level with a permitted NCC shall be taken, and
the MS shall repeat steps ii) and iii) above.

v\) If the cells with the 6 strongest average received signal level
values with a permitted NCC have been tried but cannot be used, the call
re‑establishment attempt shall be abandoned, and the algorithm of
subclause 6.7.1 shall be performed.

The MS is under no circumstances allowed to access a cell to attempt
call re‑establishment later than 20 seconds after the detection within
the MS of the radio link failure causing the call re‑establishment
attempt. In the case where the 20 seconds elapses without a successful
call re‑establishment the call re‑establishment attempt shall be
abandoned, and the algorithm of subclause 6.7.1 shall be performed.

Call re‑establishment shall not be applied for voice group calls.

6.8 Abnormal cases and emergency calls
--------------------------------------

When in the limited service state (see 3GPP TS 43.022 \[11\]) the aim is
to gain normal service rapidly and the following tasks shall be
performed, depending on the conditions, as given in the table below:

a\) The MS shall monitor the received signal level of all RF channels
within its bands of operation, and search for a BCCH carrier which has
C1 \> 0 and which is not barred. When such a carrier is found, the MS
shall camp on that cell, irrespective of the PLMN identity.

b\) The MS shall search the strongest RF channels to determine which
PLMNs are available (Manual Mode) or available and allowable (Automatic
Mode). This information shall be processed according to the PLMN
selection algorithm defined in 3GPP TS 43.022 \[11\].

c\) The MS shall perform cell reselection at least among the cells of
the PLMN of the cell on which the MS has camped, according to the
algorithm of 3GPP TS 43.022 \[11\], except that a zero value of
CELL\_RESELECT\_HYSTERESIS shall be used.

6.9 RLA\_EC signal level and SLA measurements
---------------------------------------------

### 6.9.1 General

For purposes of cell selection, cell reselection, coverage class
selection and for deriving the C value in packet idle mode (see
subclause 10.2.3.1.1), a MS that has enabled EC operation or that
supports EC-GSM-IoT and is attempting to select an EC-GSM-IoT capable
cell shall measure received signal level. In addition, for purposes of
downlink coverage class selection, a MS that has enabled EC operation
shall, if so indicated by the DL\_CC\_Selection parameter (see 3GPP TS
44.018 \[17\]), measure signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio (SINR).

NOTE: If the network indicates by the DL\_CC\_Selection parameter to
measure SINR (for interference limited scenarios in extended coverage),
it should not have configured EC-PICH, i.e. it should not indicate EC
paging indication channel support in EC SI (see 3GPP TS 44.018 \[17\]).

These measurements are specified in the following subclauses.

### 6.9.2 Physical parameters

The RMS received wanted signal level at the receiver input shall be
estimated by the MS on bursts of the FCCH and/or EC-SCH channels. The
estimated received wanted signal level shall exclude contributions from
other sources such as interference and noise.

In addition, if SINR is to be measured, wanted signal level and
interference plus noise level shall be measured by the MS on the same
bursts.

NOTE: The interference plus noise level can for instance be calculated
by subtracting the received wanted signal level from the received total
signal level.

During the estimation, the MS shall attempt to synchronize to the cell,
decode the EC-SCH and decode the 9 bit BSIC value sent as part of the
EC-SCH payload space.

### 6.9.3 Statistical parameter

The estimated parameter (RLA\_EC) shall be the linear average of at
least 10 received wanted signal level measurements during at least 5 s,
expressed in dBm.

If SINR is to be measured, the parameter SLA shall be calculated as

SLA = RLA\_EC -- INA

> where INA is the linear average of the interference plus noise
> measurements on the same bursts on which RLA\_EC was based, expressed
> in dBm.

The RLA\_EC and SLA estimates are valid only if at least one successful
decoding of EC-SCH and verification of BSIC has occurred during this
time.

The RLA\_EC for the serving cell shall also be used as the C value in
packet idle mode (see subclause 10.2.3.1.1).

### 6.9.4 Accuracy requirements

RLA\_EC shall be measured for received wanted signal levels in the full
range of -122 dBm to ‑48 dBm with an absolute accuracy of ±3 dB under
both normal and extreme conditions.

If the received signal wanted level falls below -122 dBm, then the
measured level shall be within the range allowed for the absolute
accuracy specified above. In case the upper limit of this range is below
-122 dBm, then the upper limit shall be considered as equal to -122 dBm.

The relative accuracy shall be as specified in subclause 8.1.2.

The received wanted signal level values above refer to the received
wanted signal level excluding contributions from interference and noise.

SLA shall be measured for SINR levels in the range of -7 dB to 27 dB for
received wanted signal levels in the range of -122 dBm to -48 dBm and
interference plus noise levels in the range of -115 dBm to -48 dBm with
an absolute accuracy of ±3 dB under both normal and extreme conditions.

If the SINR falls below -7 dB or rises above 27 dB, the measured SLA
shall be below -4 dB and above 24 dB, respectively.

For test purposes the following radio conditions can be used:
BT\_Threshold\_DL = 8 dB, CC2\_Range\_DL = 6 dB, CC3\_Range\_DL = 6 dB.
Serving GSM cell at RXLEV= -70 dBm with two non-serving cells acting as
co-channel interferers both at -84 dBm, at -78 dBm, at -72 dBm, or at
-66 dBm, for the MS to select CC1, CC2, CC3 or CC4, respectively.

### 6.9.5 Void

6.9a RLA\_GC signal level measurements 
--------------------------------------

### 6.9a.1 General

For purposes of cell selection and cell reselection a MS capable of
EC-GSM-IoT shall when applicable (see sub-clause 6.4) measure received
signal level as specified in this subclause.

### 6.9a.2 Physical parameter

The R.M.S received signal level at the receiver input shall be estimated
by the MS on bursts transmitted on TN0 on the BCCH carrier.

### 6.9a.3 Statistical parameter

The estimated parameter (RLA\_GC) shall be the linear average of at
least 10 received signal level measurements during at least 5 s,
expressed in dBm.

### 6.9a.4 Accuracy requirements

The accuracy defined in subclause 8.1.2 for RXLEV shall apply.

6.10 Coverage class selection for EC-GSM-IoT
--------------------------------------------

### 6.10.1 General

A MS that has enabled EC operation shall, before each time the paging
block is monitored or, if the MS supports EC Paging Indication Channel
monitoring and the support of this channel is indicated in EC System
Information, before each time the EC-PICH block is monitored, or before
each uplink transmission, estimate the uplink CC (coverage class) and
the downlink CC, unless the MS has done these estimations within the
last 30 seconds.

### 6.10.2 Downlink coverage class selection

The MS shall select the downlink CC based on either RLA\_EC or SLA, as
indicated by the DL\_CC\_Selection parameter sent in EC SI 2 (see 3GPP
TS 44.018 \[17\]), according to table 6.10.2-1 and indicate it to the
network in the EC Packet Channel Request message (see 3GPP TS 44.018
\[17\]). The network shall apply the indicated downlink CC on EC-AGCH.

+----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+

BT\_Threshold\_DL indicates the RLA\_EC (in dBm) or SLA (in dB) below
which blind physical layer transmissions are used on EC-AGCH.
CC2\_Range\_DL and CC3\_Range\_DL indicate the RLA\_EC range (in dB) of
downlink CC2 and CC3, respectively.

BT\_Threshold\_DL and EC\_RXLEV\_ACCESS\_MIN are broadcast in EC SI 2
(see 3GPP TS 44.018 \[17\]).

CC2\_Range\_DL and CC3\_Range\_DL are optionally broadcast in EC SI 2.
If either of CC2\_Range\_DL and CC3\_Range\_DL is not broadcast, its
value shall be set to 0 and the corresponding downlink CC is not
supported by the network.

If RLA\_EC or SLA (whichever is applicable) is on the limit between two
CC, the MS shall select the higher CC.

In case downlink CC1 is selected, the MS shall further indicate in the
EC Packet Channel Request message (see 3GPP TS 44.018 \[17\]) the margin
of the measured RLA\_EC (or SLA) relative to BT\_Threshold\_DL. The
parameter DL\_Signal\_Strength\_Step\_Size broadcast in EC SI 2 (see
3GPP TS 44.018 \[17\]) is used to quantize the margin to report in the
EC Packet Channel Request message. The maximum margin that can be
reported is dependent on the number of Coverage Classes supported in the
cell, and whether or not the access is initiated on RACH or EC-RACH, see
3GPP TS 44.018 \[17\].

NOTE: When TX diversity (antenna hopping) is active a MS may
underestimate RLA\_EC. This can be compensated for by the NW in an
adjustment of the BT\_Threshold\_DL.

### 6.10.3 Uplink coverage class selection

The MS shall select the uplink CC to use on (EC-)RACH according to table
6.10.3-1, based on the uplink received signal strength, estimated as

BS\_RX\_PWR = RLA\_EC + min(MSPWR, MS\_TXPWR\_MAX\_CCH) -- BSPWR.

MSPWR is the nominal maximum output power of the MS. MS\_TXPWR\_MAX\_CCH
is the maximum TX power level an MS is allowed to use when accessing the
system. BSPWR is the output power of the BTS used on FCCH and EC-SCH.
MS\_TXPWR\_MAX\_CCH and BSPWR are broadcast in EC SI 2 (see 3GPP TS
44.018 \[17\]).

BT\_Threshold\_UL indicates the BS\_RX\_PWR (in dBm) below which blind
physical layer transmissions are used on EC-RACH. CC2\_Range\_UL,
CC3\_Range\_UL and CC4\_Range\_UL indicate the BS\_RX\_PWR range (in dB)
of uplink CC2, CC3 and CC4, respectively. BT\_Threshold\_UL is broadcast
in EC SI 2 while CC2\_Range\_UL, CC3\_Range\_UL and CC4\_Range\_UL are
optionally broadcast in EC SI 2 (see 3GPP TS 44.018 \[17\]). If either
of CC2\_Range\_UL and CC3\_Range\_UL is not present, its value shall be
set to 0 and the corresponding uplink CC is not used. If CC4\_Range\_UL
is not present the uplink coverage class CC5 is not used, whilst CC4
shall be considered being supported by the network. If CC4\_Range\_UL is
present and the MS does not support uplink CC5 (see 3GPP TS 24.008), it
shall ignore the CC4\_Range\_UL parameter. If BS\_RX\_PWR is on the
limit between two CC, the MS shall select the higher CC.

NOTE: The maximum BTS output power (BSPWR), EC\_RXLEV\_ACCESS\_MIN (see
table 6.4-2) and MS\_TXPWR\_MAX\_CCH (see table 6.4-2) will together
define the lowest signal level possible to estimate on the UL
(BS\_RX\_PWR). Hence, by appropriate settings of BT\_Threshold\_UL,
CC2\_Range\_UL, CC3\_Range\_UL and CC4\_Range\_UL, the set of uplink
Coverage Classes possible to select by the MS can be restricted.

### 6.10.4 Coverage class adaptation for EC-CCCH

If CC adaptation on EC-RACH and EC-AGCH is allowed (as indicated by the
CC\_Access\_Adaptation parameter broadcast in EC SI 2, see 3GPP TS
44.018 \[17\]), the MS shall gradually increase its CC as described in
3GPP TS 44.018 \[17\] and use it as its selected uplink or downlink CC.

### 6.10.5 Downlink coverage class update

For the purpose of paging block monitoring on EC-PCH or, if the MS
supports EC Paging Indication Channel monitoring and the support of this
channel is indicated in EC System Information, for the purpose of paging
indication monitoring on EC-PICH, the MS shall keep the network informed
about the selected downlink CC (see subclause 6.10.2). The MS shall
indicate the selected downlink CC using the Selected DL Coverage Class
field in the EC Packet Channel Request message. This shall be done in
advance of the next occurrence of the paging group of the MS or, if the
MS supports EC Paging Indication Channel monitoring and the support of
this channel is indicated in EC System Information, in advance of the
EC-PICH block corresponding to the paging block for the next occurrence
of the paging group of the MS, and at least if any of the following
conditions are fulfilled:

\- the selected downlink CC is higher than the last downlink CC
communicated to the network;

\- the selected downlink CC is CC1 and the last downlink CC communicated
to the network is CC4; or

\- the MS has completed an uplink data transfer in a cell not supporting
EC-GSM-IoT since the last time it communicated a downlink CC to the
network.

A downlink CC is considered to be communicated to the network at
successful contention resolution (see 3GPP TS 44.018) following a system
access triggered by an EC PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST. The communicated
downlink CC is the 'Used DL Coverage Class' if the EC IMMEDIATE
ASSIGNMENT type 2 message is used, or, is CC1 if the EC IMMEDIATE
ASSIGNMENT type 1 is used.

The network shall apply the indicated downlink CC on EC-PCH messages
sent to that MS.

7 Network pre-requisites
========================

7.1 BCCH carriers
-----------------

The BCCH carrier shall be continuously transmitted on all timeslots.

In normal operation, it shall be transmitted without variation of RF
level in case all timeslots on BCCH carrier are GMSK modulated and else
in case of different modulated timeslots with minimum variation of RF
level as specified below. An exception applies in case the BTS enters
the BCCH carrier power reduction operation, for the purpose of energy
saving, where the variation of RF level for all timeslots on BCCH
carrier, except timeslots carrying BCCH/CCCH, is relaxed as specified
below.

The RF power level may be ramped down between timeslots for instance to
facilitate switching between RF transmitters.

A BTS that is switching transmission between two or more antennas, shall
use the same antenna for transmission on a CCCH slot and the slot
immediately preceding the CCCH slot (i.e. antenna switching shall be
avoided immediately before a CCCH slot in order to avoid unpredictable
path loss changes at this point).

In normal operation, for timeslots on the BCCH carrier which are
transmitted with modulations other than GMSK, the output power (as
defined in 3GPP TS 45.005) may be lower than the output power used for
GMSK modulated timeslots. In this case, the maximum allowed difference
in output power actually transmitted by the BTS is listed for each
respective modulation of EGPRS, EGPRS2 and VAMOS in the table below.

In BCCH carrier power reduction operation, for timeslots on the BCCH
carrier, except timeslots carrying BCCH/CCCH, the output power (as
defined in 3GPP TS 45.005) may be lower than the output power used for
timeslots carrying BCCH/CCCH. In this case the maximum allowed
difference in output power actually transmitted by the BTS is 6 dB.

Furthermore, in normal operation, between a timeslot used for BCCH/CCCH
and the timeslot preceding it, the difference in output power actually
transmitted by the BTS shall not exceed 3 dB.

NOTE: The allowed output power decrease does not refer to a difference
between nominal power levels, but to the difference in output power
actually transmitted.

Maximum output power decrease on BCCH carrier in normal operation.

+----------+------------+--------------+
|          | Modulation | Output Power |
|          |            |              |
|          |            | Decrease     |
+----------+------------+--------------+
| EGPRS    | 8PSK       | 4 dB         |
+----------+------------+--------------+
| EGPRS2-A | 16QAM      | 6 dB         |
+----------+------------+--------------+
| EGPRS2-A | 32QAM      | 6 dB         |
+----------+------------+--------------+
| EGPRS2-B | QPSK       | 4 dB         |
+----------+------------+--------------+
| EGPRS2-B | 16QAM      | 6 dB         |
+----------+------------+--------------+
| EGPRS2-B | 32QAM      | 6 dB         |
+----------+------------+--------------+
| VAMOS    | AQPSK      | 4 dB         |
+----------+------------+--------------+

The MS requirements on signal strength measurements are defined for
normal operation of the BTS for the case when only GMSK modulation is
used on the BCCH carrier. There are no defined signal strength
measurement requirements for the MS in BCCH carrier power reduction
operation or if other modulations are used on the BCCH carrier.

On the PCH the network shall send valid layer 3 messages according to
3GPP TS 44.018. Unused signalling blocks on the CCCH/BCCH shall contain
L2 fill frames. Other unused timeslots shall transmit dummy bursts.

The number of neighbour cell BCCH carriers in the BCCH allocation shall
not exceed 32.

NOTE 1: This BCCH organization enables MS to measure the received signal
level from surrounding cells by tuning and listening to their BCCH
carriers. Providing that an MS tunes to the list of BCCH carriers
indicated by the network it will, providing the list is sufficiently
complete, have listened to all possible surrounding cells, i.e. the
surrounding cell list for handover purposes is effectively defined by
the MS. Refer to 3GPP TS 43.022 for definitions of the BCCH carrier
lists. This can be achieved without inter‑base station synchronization.

NOTE 2: If the operator decides to allow for the usage of modulation
types other than GMSK on the BCCH carrier in certain cells, the cell
selection, cell reselection and handover procedures involving these
cells will be somewhat sub-optimal. This is due to the fact that the
signal level measured by the MS at some instances in time will be
affected by the possibly lower output power level of the 8-PSK
modulation type used in EGPRS, and by the output power level of QPSK,
8-PSK, 16-QAM and 32-QAM modulation types used in EGPRS2, and by the
AQPSK modulation used in VAMOS respectively, and by the power
fluctuation resulting from these modulation types other than GMSK. The
extent of the performance degradation is dependent upon the measurement
schedule in each particular MS as well as upon the used output power
decrease and the current load of the modulation types other than GMSK on
the BCCH carrier. By limiting the maximum number of time slots, carrying
modulation types other than GMSK, being simultaneously allowed on the
BCCH carrier, and/or carefully selecting the values of involved network
parameters, the impact on the above mentioned procedures may be
minimised. Additionally, in areas with very low cell overlap, some
coverage loss effects may have to be taken into account by the operator
when selecting network parameters.

NOTE 3: In the case that QPSK, AQPSK, 8-PSK, 16-QAM or 32-QAM modulation
s (see Note 2) are allowed on the BCCH carrier and frequency hopping
including the BCCH carrier is used, the reception quality in connected
mode for some fast moving MS (meaning MS experiencing Doppler
frequencies of 100 Hz or more) may be degraded. This may be seen as a
backwards compatibility problem for some existing MS, most likely
occurring if the used APD is larger than 2 dB.

NOTE 4: In case the BTS supports BCCH carrier power reduction operation,
in order to yield network energy savings, the usage of this operation
mode by the operator needs some consideration. For instance in areas
with very low cell overlap, some coverage loss effects may have to be
taken into account. Additionally the operated reduction of output power
on timeslots of the BCCH carrier should be similar in neighbouring
cells, i.e. the usage of this operation mode should not be applied cell
specific, but applied to as many cells as possible in a certain
geographic area. The benefit of this operation mode in busy hour times
was investigated to be rather limited \[48\]. Thus the actual level of
operated power reduction on timeslots of the BCCH carrier except
timeslots carrying BCCH/CCCH should generally be reduced along the
increase of traffic load in cells and may be selected to be higher for
idle timeslots than for occupied timeslots. Usage of power reduction on
timeslots of the BCCH carrier carrying SDCCH in BCCH carrier power
reduction operation is not recommended.

7.2 Identification of surrounding BSS
-------------------------------------

### 7.2.1 General

It is essential for the MS to identify which surrounding BSS is being
measured in order to ensure reliable handover and/or for cell
reselection purposes. Because of frequency re‑use with small cluster
sizes, the BCCH carrier frequency may not be sufficient to uniquely
identify a surrounding cell, i.e. the cell in which the MS is situated
may have more than one surrounding cell using the same BCCH frequency.
Thus it is necessary for the MS to synchronize to and demodulate
surrounding BCCH carriers and identify the 6 bit base station
identification code (BSIC).

In networks where EC-GSM-IoT is supported, the frequency re-use cluster
size is expected to be smaller than for networks not supporting
EC-GSM-IoT. To allow unique identification of surrounding cells, the
BSIC used for EC-GSM-IoT on the EC-SCH is 9 bits. The 9 bit Base Station
Identity Code (BSIC) shall be transmitted on each BCCH carrier where the
EC-SCH is also mapped. The BSIC is sent as part of the EC-SCH payload
space (see 3GPP TS 44.018) and consists of 3 bits of Network colour code
(NCC), 3 bits of BS colour code (BCC) and 3 bits of Radio frequency
Colour Code (RCC), as defined in 3GPP TS 23.003. An MS that has enabled
EC operation shall use the 9 bit BSIC value for BSIC decoding and
confirmation of EC-GSM-IoT capable cells. The 9 bit BSIC shall also be
used by a MS in EC operation when sending a packet channel request, see
3GPP TS 45.003.

To allow unique identification of the serving cell in a network
supporting PEO, a 9 bit Base Station Identity Code (BSIC) is used, which
consists of 3 bits of Network colour code (NCC), 3 bits of BS colour
code (BCC) and 3 bits of Radio frequency Colour Code (RCC), see 3GPP TS
23.003. The NCC and the BCC are sent as part of the SCH payload space
and the RCC is included in the System Information Type 13 message and in
AGCH and PCH messages, see 3GPP TS 44.018. An MS that has enabled PEO
shall use the 9 bit BSIC value (NCC, BCC and RCC) for BSIC decoding and
confirmation of a PEO capable cell. The 9 bit BSIC shall also be used by
an MS that has enabled PEO when sending a packet channel request, see
3GPP TS 45.003.

The MS shall be able to demodulate BCCH carriers and identify the BSIC
at levels down to the reference sensitivity level or reference
interference levels as specified in 3GPP TS 45.005.

### 7.2.2 Identification of surrounding BSS for handover measurements

The MS shall use at least 4 spare frames per SACCH block period for the
purpose of decoding the BSICs (e.g. in the case of TCH/F, the four idle
frames per SACCH block period). These frames are termed \"search\"
frames.

A 6 bit Base Station Identity Code (BSIC), as defined in 3GPP TS 23.003,
shall be transmitted on each BCCH carrier. The PLMN part of the BSIC can
be regarded as a \"PLMN colour code\".

The MS shall attempt to demodulate the SCH on the BCCH carrier of as
many surrounding cells as possible, and decode the BSIC as often as
possible, and as a minimum at least once every 10 seconds. A multi-RAT
MS is allowed to extend this period to 13 seconds, if the neighbour cell
list contains cells or frequencies from other RATs. The MS shall give
priority for synchronisation attempts in signal strength order and
considering the parameter MULTIBAND\_REPORTING. A list containing
information about the timing of the surrounding cells at the accuracy
required for accessing a cell (see 3GPP TS 45.010) including the
absolute times derived from the parameters T1, T2, T3 shall be kept by
the MS. This information may be used to schedule the decoding of BSIC
and shall be used in connection with handover in order to keep the
switching time at a minimum. The network may provide Real Time
Difference (RTD, see 3GPP TS 45.010) to assist the MS in neighbour cell
synchronisation attempts. This assistance data is included in the
MEASUREMENT INFORMATION message (See 3GPP TS 44.018). RTD is provided
modulo one multiframe (51 TDMA frames). The resolution is either one
TDMA frame, in which case the MS can assume that the cells are frame
synchronised, or 1/64 TDMA frame. The MS may use other assistance data
too, if received elsewhere, e.g. for position services received
information. The actual number of carriers the MS is capable of
synchronising to, depends on the Observed Time Difference (OTD, see 3GPP
TS 45.010) for each neighbour cell and the availability of the
assistance information.

If, after averaging measurement results over 2 SACCH block periods, the
MS detects one or more BCCH carriers, among the 6 strongest, whose BSICs
are not currently being assessed, then the MS shall as a matter of
priority attempt to decode their BSICs.

In the case of a multi band MS, the MS shall attempt to decode the BSIC,
if any BCCH carrier with unknown BSIC is detected among the number of
strongest BCCH carriers in each band as indicated by the parameter
MULTIBAND\_REPORTING.

Thus an MS shall, for a period of up to 5 seconds, devote all search
frames to attempting to decode these BSICs. If this fails then the MS
shall return to confirming existing BSICs. Having re‑confirmed existing
BSICs, if there are still BCCH carriers, among the six strongest, with
unknown BSICs, then the decoding of these shall again be given priority
for a further period of up to 5 seconds.

The MS shall report a new strongest GSM cell in the measurement report
at the latest 5 s after a new strongest cell (which is part of the
BA(SACCH)) has been activated under the following network conditions:
Initial serving cell at RXLEV= -70 dBm, with 6 neighbours at RXLEV= -75
dBm. Then the new BCCH carrier is switched on at RXLEV= -60 dBm.

NOTE: Because of test equipment limitations it is acceptable to activate
the new carrier to replace one of the 6 neighbours.

If either no BSIC can be demodulated on a surrounding cell BCCH carrier,
or the BSIC is not allowed, then the received signal level measurements
on that channel shall be discarded. The allowed BSIC is either the BSIC
broadcast for that carrier in the neighbour cell list or, if no BSIC is
included or if indicated by the parameter INVALID\_BSIC\_REPORTING, a
BSIC with permitted NCC part. The permitted NCCs are defined by the
NCC\_PERMITTED parameter transmitted in the BCCH data. This is an 8 bit
map that relates to the NCC part of BSIC (e.g. NCC\_PERMITTED =
01101001, defines that only carriers having a BSIC with the NCC part =
000, 011, 101,110 shall be reported). In a shared cell, the MS
supporting Network sharing (see 3GPP TS 44.018 \[17\], 3GPP TS 23.251
\[45\] and 3GPP TS 24.008 \[46\]) shall use the NCC\_PERMITTED
applicable for the selected PLMN.

If a change of BSIC is detected on a carrier, then any existing received
signal level measurement shall be discarded and a new averaging period
commenced. This occurs when the MS moves away from one surrounding cell
and closer to another co‑channel cell.

If the BSIC cannot be decoded at the next available opportunities
re‑attempts shall be made to decode this BSIC. If the BSIC is not
decoded for more than three successive attempts it will be considered
lost and any existing received signal level measurement shall be
discarded.

If an MS receives a handover command towards a GSM cell to which it is
not synchronised to, then the MS shall search for synchronisation
information up to 300 ms. In case of failure, the MS shall refer to the
handover failure procedure (see 3GPP TS 44.018).

If a multi-RAT MS receives a handover command towards a not known cell
(see 3GPP TS 25.133 and 3GPP TS 25.123 for UTRAN), then the multi-RAT MS
shall search for synchronisation information up to 800 ms. In case of
failure, the multi-RAT MS shall refer to the handover failure procedure
(see 3GPP TS 44.018).

Details of the synchronization mechanisms appear in 3GPP TS 45.010. The
procedure for monitoring surrounding BTS with respect to HO measurement
shall begin at least at the time of assignment of a dedicated channel.

When a BCCH carrier is found to be no longer among the reported, timing
and BSIC information shall be retained for at least 10 seconds. (This is
in case a handover is commanded to this cell just after the MS stops
reporting RXLEV and RXQUAL on this cell).

7.3 Handover measurements on other radio access technologies
------------------------------------------------------------

For a multi-RAT MS, the network controls the identification and
measurements of UTRAN and CDMA2000 cells by the parameter Qsearch\_C
sent on SACCH or, if Qsearch\_C is not received, by Qsearch\_C\_Initial
sent on BCCH. Qsearch\_C defines a threshold and also indicates whether
these tasks shall be performed when RXLEV (see subclause 8.1.3) of the
serving BCCH carrier is below or above the threshold.

If the serving cell is not included in the BA(SACCH) list, the dedicated
channel is not on the BCCH carrier, and Qsearch\_C is not equal to 15,
the MS shall disregard the Qsearch\_C parameter value and always search
for UTRAN and CDMA2000 cells. If Qsearch\_C is equal to 15, the MS shall
never search for UTRAN or CDMA2000 cells.

For a UTRAN capable MS, the network enables the identification and
measurement for UTRAN cells on specific frequencies by
DEFAULT\_Measurement\_Control\_UTRAN and Measurement\_Control\_UTRAN
sent on SACCH.

For a E-UTRAN capable MS, the network controls the identification and
measurements of E-UTRAN cells by the parameter Qsearch\_C\_E-UTRAN sent
on SACCH or, if Qsearch\_C\_E-UTRAN is not received, by
Qsearch\_C\_E-UTRAN\_Initial sent on BCCH.

For a E-UTRAN capable MS, the network enables the identification and
measurement for E-UTRAN cells on specific frequencies by
DEFAULT\_Measurement\_Control\_E-UTRAN and Measurement\_Control\_E-UTRAN
sent on SACCH.

The MS may use the search frames, which are not required for BSIC
decoding, for measurements of UTRAN, CDMA2000 and E-UTRAN cells. The MS
may use up to 25 search frames per 13 seconds without considering the
need for BSIC decoding in these frames.

A UTRAN capable MS shall report a new best UTRAN cell, which is part of
the neighbour cell list, at the latest 5 seconds after it has been
activated under the condition that there is only one UTRAN frequency in
the neighbour cell list (and no E-UTRAN frequencies in the E-UTRAN
Neighbour Cell list) and that no new GSM cells are activated at the same
time and under good radio conditions. A E-UTRAN capable MS that supports
measurement reporting in dedicated mode or dual transfer mode shall
report a new best E-UTRAN cell, on a frequency contained in the
neighbour cell list, at the latest 5 seconds after it has been activated
under the condition that there is only one E-UTRAN frequency in the
neighbour cell list (and no UTRAN frequencies in the 3G Neighbour Cell
list) and that no new GSM cells are activated at the same time and under
good radio conditions. For test purposes the following radio conditions
can be used: Serving GSM cell at RXLEV= -70 dBm, with 6 GSM neighbours
at RXLEV= -75 dBm. Then either an UTRAN FDD neighbour cell or an UTRAN
TDD neighbour cell or an E-UTRAN FDD neighbour cell or an E-UTRAN TDD
neighbour cell is switched on. The radio conditions for the UTRAN FDD
cell are as follows (see 3GPP TS 25.101 for definitions):

The allowed reporting time is increased by 5 seconds for each additional
UTRAN frequency in the neighbour cell list or for each additional
E-UTRAN frequency in the neighbour cell list and by the time required
for BSIC decoding of new activated GSM cells. However, multiple UTRAN
cells on the same frequency in the neighbour cell list does not increase
the allowed reporting time.

When on TCH, identification of a UTRAN TDD cell is guaranteed only in
case of single slot operation and, for the 3.84 Mcps option, if the
UTRAN TDD cell uses synchronisation option 2 (see 3GPP TS 25.221). In
all other cases, the MS may not be able to fulfil the requirement above.
If after 5 seconds the MS has not been able to identify a UTRAN TDD
cell, the MS is allowed to stop searching for it in the current GSM
cell.

When on SDCCH, the MS may use all TDMA frames, which are not part of the
assigned channel or required for GSM signal strength measurements, for
the above task. In this case the allowed reporting time is 1.7 seconds,
with the same assumptions as above.

A multi-RAT MS shall be able to monitor cells from other radio access
technologies, divided into (depending on the MS capability):

\- UTRAN FDD cells on up to 3 FDD frequencies, with a maximum of 32
cells per frequency\
- UTRAN TDD cells on up to 3 TDD frequencies, with a maximum of 32 cells
per frequency; and/or\
- CDMA2000 cells; and/or\
- E-UTRAN FDD cells on up to 3 FDD frequencies; and/or\
- E-UTRAN TDD cells on up to 3 TDD frequencies.

The total number of monitored UTRAN and CDMA2000 cells shall not exceed
64.

*An MS supporting E-UTRAN measurements shall be capable of monitoring a
minimum total of 7 other RAT carrier frequency layers, comprising of
any* above defined *combination of E-UTRAN FDD, E-UTRAN TDD, UTRAN FDD
and UTRAN TDD layers.*

The MS shall be capable of performing RSCP and Ec/No measurements of at
least 4 best UTRAN cells per UTRAN frequency and RSRP and RSRQ
measurements of at least 4 best E-UTRAN cells per E-UTRAN frequency,
according to its supported capabilities.

A multi-RAT MS with no or an empty CSG Whitelist, or which does not
indicate support of \"UTRA CSG Cells Reporting\" in the *Classmark 3* IE
(see 3GPP TS 24.008)**,** is not required to measure, and shall not
report, cells known to be CSG cells while in dedicated mode or dual
transfer mode.

7.4 Handover measurements on UTRAN CSG cells and hybrid cells
-------------------------------------------------------------

**A UTRAN capable mobile station supporting \"**UTRA CSG Cells
Reporting**\" shall support MIB/SIB3 reading and reporting for UTRAN CSG
cells in dedicated mode and dual transfer mode.** The mobile station may
acquire the routing parameters and CSG ID of a UTRAN CSG cell by reading
MIB and SIB3 of that cell (see 3GPP TS 25.331). The MS is allowed to
autonomously skip idle frames or TDMA frames on TCH and/or, in case of
dual transfer mode, on PDCH to read MIB and SIB3 and only skips the
timeslot(s) or TDMA frame(s) during which either MIB or SIB3 is
transmitted.

A UTRAN capable mobile station **which indicates** support of \"UTRA CSG
Cells Reporting\" in the *Classmark 3* IE (see 3GPP TS 24.008) **shall
report CSG cells and hybrid cells in dedicated mode and dual transfer
mode according to the procedures in sub-clause 8.4.9 if**:

\- the cell is the strongest of any cell on the same frequency (see 3GPP
TS 25.304 \[8\] for the definition of the strongest cell); and

\- (for UTRAN FDD CSG cells) the reported value (CPICH Ec/No) is equal
to or higher than UTRAN\_CSG\_FDD\_REPORTING\_THRESHOLD and the
non-reported value (CPICH RSCP) is equal to or higher than
UTRAN\_CSG\_FDD\_REPORTING\_THRESHOLD\_2; and

\- (for UTRAN TDD CSG cells) the reported value (P-CCPCH RSCP) is equal
to or higher than UTRAN\_CSG\_TDD\_REPORTING\_THRESHOLD; and

\- the **conditions specified in** 3GPP TS 44.018 are met.

The parameters Qsearch\_C and Measurement\_Control\_UTRAN are not
applicable to UTRAN CSG cells.

If information about dedicated CSG frequencies is available to the MS,
the MS may restrict the measurement of CSG cells to only those on these
dedicated frequencies and the other frequencies listed in the system
information.

8 Radio link measurements
=========================

Radio link measurements are used in the handover and RF power control
processes.

In particular, radio‑subsystem directed handover is defined as a change
of channel(s) during a call either because of degradation of the quality
of one or more of the current serving channel(s), or because of the
availability of other channel(s) which can allow communication at a
lower TX power level, or to prevent a MS grossly exceeding the planned
cell boundaries.

Additional measurements, so called Extended measurements, can e.g. be
used for frequency planning purposes.

The measurements are made over each SACCH multiframe, which is 104 TDMA
frames (480 ms) for a TCH and DBPSCH, and 102 TDMA frames (470,8 ms) for
an SDCCH. Additionally, when in FPC mode, quality measurements shall
also be made over each FPC reporting period. Additionally, when in EPC
mode, quality measurements shall also be made over each EPC reporting
period.

For a multi-RAT MS, measurements on other radio access technologies may
be performed during search frames (see subclause 7.3 and 10.1.1.3).

8.1 Signal level
----------------

### 8.1.1 General

The received signal level may be employed as a criterion in the RF power
control and handover processes. For cells of other radio access
technology, RXLEV is replaced by the relevant measurement quantity for
that radio access technology (see subclause 8.1.5).

### 8.1.2 Physical parameter

The R.M.S received signal level at the receiver input shall be measured
by the MS and the BSS over the full range of ‑110 dBm to ‑48 dBm with an
absolute accuracy of ±4 dB from ‑110 dBm to ‑70 dBm under normal
conditions and ±6 dB over the full range under both normal and extreme
conditions. The R.M.S received signal level at the receiver input shall
be measured by the MS above -48 dBm up to -38 dBm with an absolute
accuracy of ± 9 dB under both normal and extreme conditions.

If the received signal level falls below the reference sensitivity level
for the type of MS or BSS, then the measured level shall be within the
range allowing for the absolute accuracy specified above. In case the
upper limit of this range is below the reference sensitivity level for
the type of MS or BSS, then the upper limit shall be considered as equal
to the reference sensitivity level.

The relative accuracy shall be as follows:

If signals of level x1 and x2 dBm are received (where x1 ≤ x2) and
levels y1 and y2 dBm respectively are measured, if x2 ‑ x1 \< 20 dB and
x1 is not below the reference sensitivity level, then y1 and y2 shall be
such that:

(x2 ‑ x1) ‑ a ≤ y2 ‑ y1 ≤ (x2 ‑ x1 + b) if the measurements are on the
same or on different RF channel within the same frequency band;

and

(x2 ‑ x1 ) ‑ c ≤ y2 ‑ y1 ≤( x2 ‑ x1 + d) if the measurements are on
different frequency bands:

a, b, c and d are in dB and depend on the value of x1 as follows:

  ------------------------- ----------------- ----------------- ----------------- -----------------

For single band MS or BTS and measurements between ARFN in the same band
for a multiband

MS or BTS;

s = reference sensitivity level as specified in 3GPP TS 45.005.

For measurements between ARFCN in different bands;

s = the reference sensitivity level as specified in 3GPP TS 45.005 for
the band including x1.

At extreme temperature conditions an extra 2 dB shall be added to c and
d in above table.

The selectivity of the received signal level measurement shall be as
follows:

‑ for adjacent (200 kHz) channel ≥ 16 dB;

‑ for adjacent (400 kHz) channel ≥ 48 dB;

‑ for adjacent (600 kHz) channel ≥ 56 dB.

The selectivity shall be met using random, continuous, GSM‑modulated
signals with the wanted signal at the level 20 dB above the reference
sensitivity level.

### 8.1.3 Statistical parameters

For each channel, the measured parameters (RXLEV) shall be the average
of the received signal level measurement samples in dBm taken on that
channel within the reporting period of length one SACCH multiframe
defined in 8.4. In averaging, measurements made during previous
reporting periods shall always be discarded.

When assigned a TCH or SDCCH in *A/Gb mode*, or a DBPSCH in *Iu mode*,
the MS shall make a received signal level measurement:

‑ in every TDMA frame on at least one of the BCCH carriers indicated in
the BCCH allocation (BA), one after another. Optionally, measurements
during up to 8 frames per SACCH multiframe may be omitted;

> As an exception, a multi-RAT MS may omit GSM measurements during up to
> 9 TDMA frames per SACCH multiframe and use these periods for
> measurements on other radio access technologies.\
> Furthermore, an MS on SDCCH is allowed schedule the measurements
> freely within the SACCH multiframe as long as the total number of
> measurement samples is maintained and the samples on each carrier are
> evenly spaced.

NOTE: These eight frames are the search frames and the frames
immediately preceding the search frames, in order to allow the MS to
search for BCCH synchronization (or inter-RAT measurements) over a full
TDMA frame.

‑ for each assigned bi‑directional channel, on all bursts of the
associated physical channel (see 3GPP TS 45.002), including those of the
SACCH. If frequency hopping is being used on the associated physical
channel and if, in the BCCH Cell Options, the Power Control Indicator
PWRC is set, measurements on the bursts on the BCCH frequency shall not
be used in the RXLEV averaging process.

Unless otherwise specified by the operator, for any TCH or SDCCH
assigned to an MS in *A/Gb mode*, or for any DBPSCH assigned to an MS in
*Iu mode*, the BSS shall make a received signal level measurement on all
time slots of the associated physical channel including those of the
SACCH, but excluding the idle timeslots.

### 8.1.4 Range of parameter

The measured signal level shall be mapped to an RXLEV value between 0
and 63, as follows:

RXLEV 0 = less than -110 dBm + SCALE.\
RXLEV 1 = ‑110 dBm + SCALE to ‑109 dBm + SCALE.\
RXLEV 2 = ‑109 dBm + SCALE to ‑108 dBm + SCALE.\
:\
:\
RXLEV 62 = ‑49 dBm + SCALE to ‑48 dBm + SCALE.\
RXLEV 63 = greater than ‑48 dBm + SCALE.

where SCALE is an offset that is used in the ENHANCED MEASUREMENT REPORT
and PACKET ENHANCED MEASUREMENT REPORT messages, otherwise it is set to
0.

The MS shall use the SCALE value as indicated by the parameter
SCALE\_ORD in the MEASUREMENT INFORMATION, PACKET CELL CHANGE ORDER and
PACKET MEASUREMENT ORDERmessages (see 3GPP TS 44.018 and 3GPP TS
44.060). If automatic scaling mode is indicated by SCALE\_ORD, the MS
shall choose the lowest SCALE value that is sufficient for reporting the
strongest signal level within each ENHANCED MEASUREMENT REPORT or PACKET
ENHANCED MEASUREMENT REPORT message.

The MS shall indicate the used SCALE value in each individual ENHANCED
MEASUREMENT REPORT or PACKET ENHANCED MEASUREMEMT REPORTmessage (see
3GPP TS 44.018 and 3GPP TS 44.060).

### 8.1.5 Measurement quantity for other radio access technologies

#### 8.1.5.1 UTRAN FDD

For UTRAN FDD cells, the measurement quantities to be used are CPICH
Ec/No and CPICH RSCP and RSSI. The measurement requirements are defined
in 3GPP TS 25.133.

RSCP shall be used for the cell re-selection criteria. Ec/No and RSCP
shall be used for a minimum quality requirement. Either RSCP or Ec/No
shall be used for measurement reporting as indicated by the parameter
FDD\_REP\_QUANT, sent on BCCH, SACCH, PBCCH and PACCH. In addition, if a
frequency without scrambling code is included in the neighbour cell
list, RSSI shall be reported for that frequency.

The measured value shall replace RXLEV in the measurement reports. The
mapping is defined in 3GPP TS 25.133. For RSCP, the range from
\"‑116 dBm ≤ CPICH RSCP \< ‑115 dBm\" (reported as 0) to
\"‑53 dBm ≤ CPICH RSCP \< ‑52 dBm\" (reported as 63) is used. RSCP
values below ‑116 dBm shall be reported as 0 and values -52 dBm and
above shall be reported as 63. For RSSI, the range from
\"-100 dBm ≤ UTRA carrier RSSI \< ‑99 dBm\" (reported as 1) to
\"‑38 dBm ≤ UTRA carrier RSSI \< ‑37 dBm\" (reported as 63) is used.
RSSI values below ‑100 dBm shall be reported as 0 and values ‑37 dBm and
above shall be reported as 63. For Ec/No, the range from
\"‑24 dB ≤ CPICH Ec/Io \< ‑23.5 dB\" (reported as 1) to
\"‑0.5 dB ≤ CPICH Ec/Io \< 0 dB\" (reported as 48) is used. Ec/No values
below -24 dB shall be reported as 0 and values 0 dB and above shall be
reported as 49.

#### 8.1.5.2 UTRAN TDD

For UTRAN TDD cells, the measurement quantity to be used is P-CCPCH
RSCP. The measurement requirements are defined in 3GPP TS 25.123.

NOTE: The RSCP may alternatively be measured on any beacon channel (see
3GPP TS 25.221).

The measured value shall replace RXLEV in the measurement reports. The
mapping is defined in 3GPP TS 25.123. For RSCP, the range from
116 dBm ≤ P‑CCPCH RSCP \< ‑115 dBm\" (reported as 0) to
\"‑53 dBm ≤ P‑CCPCH RSCP \< ‑52 dBm\" (reported as 63) is used. Values
below ‑116 dBm shall be reported as 0 and values ‑52 dBm and above shall
be reported as 63.

#### 8.1.5.3 cdma2000

For cdma2000 cells, the measurement quantity to be used is
PILOT\_STRENGTH of the pilot. The measurement requirements are defined
in TIA/EIA/IS-2000-5-A.

The measured value shall replace RXLEV in the measurement reports.

#### 8.1.5.4 E-UTRAN FDD

For E-UTRAN FDD cells, the measurement quantities to be used are RSRP
and RSRQ. The measurement requirements are defined in 3GPP TS 36.133.

RSRP shall be used for the priority-based cell re-selection criteria.
RSRQ may be used for the priority-based cell re-selection criteria and
shall be used for link quality determination for handover purposes.
Either RSRP or RSRQ shall be used for measurement reporting as indicated
by the parameter E-UTRAN\_REP\_QUANT, sent on BCCH, SACCH and PACCH. An
MS indicating support for E-UTRA Wideband RSRQ measurements (see 3GPP TS
24.008), shall perform these measurements on the number of resource
blocks as indicated by the parameter Measurement Bandwidth (see 3GPP TS
44.018 and 3GPP TS 44.060), sent on BCCH, SACCH and PACCH.

The measured value shall replace RXLEV in the measurement reports. For
reporting using 6 bits, the measured RSRP shall be mapped to a value
between 0 and 63, as follows:

RSRP 0 = less than ‑140 dBm\
RSRP 1 = ‑140 dBm to ‑138 dBm\
:\
:\
RSRP 17 = ‑108 dBm to ‑106 dBm\
RSRP 18 = ‑106 dBm to ‑105 dBm\
RSRP 19 = ‑105 dBm to ‑104 dBm\
:\
:\
RSRP 44 = ‑80 dBm to ‑79 dBm\
RSRP 45 = ‑79 dBm to ‑78 dBm\
RSRP 46 = ‑78 dBm to ‑76 dBm\
:\
:\
RSRP 62 = ‑46 dBm to ‑44 dBm\
RSRP 63 = greater than or equal to ‑44 dBm

NOTE 1: The mapping for RSRP is different from the one defined in 3GPP
TS 36.133.

NOTE 2: For each reporting range, the lowest value of the interval is
included whereas the highest value of the interval is excluded.

For reporting using 3 bits (see 3GPP TS 44.018), the measured RSRP shall
be mapped to a value between 0 and 7 as follows, where 'Offset' is the
value of the parameter E‑UTRAN\_FDD\_MEASUREMENT\_REPORT\_OFFSET or
E‑UTRAN\_TDD\_MEASUREMENT\_REPORT\_OFFSET and 'Step' is the value given
by the parameter REPORTING\_GRANULARITY:

RSRP 0 = Offset to Offset + Step\
RSRP 1 = Offset  + Step to Offset + 2 \* Step\
RSRP 2 = Offset  + 2 \* Step to Offset + 3 \* Step\
RSRP 3 = Offset  + 3 \* Step to Offset + 4 \* Step\
RSRP 4 = Offset  + 4 \* Step to Offset + 5 \* Step\
RSRP 5 = Offset  + 5 \* Step to Offset + 6 \* Step\
RSRP 6 = Offset  + 6 \* Step to Offset + 7 \* Step\
RSRP 7 = greater than or equal to Offset + 7 \* Step

NOTE 3: For each reporting range, the lowest value of the interval is
included whereas the highest value of the interval is excluded.

For RSRQ, the mapping is defined in 3GPP TS 36.133. For reporting using
6 bits, the range from \"‑19.5 dB ≤ RSRQ \< ‑19 dB\" (reported as 1) to
\"‑3.5 dB ≤ RSRQ \< ‑3 dB\" (reported as 33) is used. RSRQ values below
‑19.5 dB shall be reported as 0 and values ‑3 dB and above shall be
reported as 34.

In case of reporting using 3 bits (see 3GPP TS 44.018), the measured
RSRQ shall be mapped to a value between 0 and 7 as follows, where
'Offset' is the value of the parameter
E‑UTRAN\_FDD\_MEASUREMENT\_REPORT\_OFFSET or
E‑UTRAN\_TDD\_MEASUREMENT\_REPORT\_OFFSET and 'Step' is the value given
by the parameter REPORTING\_GRANULARITY:

RSRQ 0 = Offset to Offset + Step\
RSRQ 1 = Offset  + Step to Offset + 2 \* Step\
RSRQ 2 = Offset  + 2 \* Step to Offset + 3 \* Step\
RSRQ 3 = Offset  + 3 \* Step to Offset + 4 \* Step\
RSRQ 4 = Offset  + 4 \* Step to Offset + 5 \* Step\
RSRQ 5 = Offset  + 5 \* Step to Offset + 6 \* Step\
RSRQ 6 = Offset  + 6 \* Step to Offset + 7 \* Step\
RSRQ 7 = greater than or equal to Offset + 7 \* Step

NOTE 4: For each reporting range, the lowest value of the interval is
included whereas the highest value of the interval is excluded.

#### 8.1.5.5 E-UTRAN TDD

For E-UTRAN TDD cells, the measurement quantities and their mappings are
the same as for E-UTRAN FDD cells (see subclause 8.1.5.4).

8.2 Signal quality
------------------

### 8.2.1 General

The received signal quality shall be employed as a criterion in the RF
power control and handover processes.

### 8.2.2 Physical parameter

The received signal quality shall be measured by the MS and BSS in a
manner that can be related to an equivalent average BER before channel
decoding (i.e. chip error ratio), assessed over the reporting period of
1 SACCH block.

For FPC, the received signal quality for each E-TCH shall be measured by
the MS and BSS in a manner that can be related to the average BER before
channel decoding, assessed over one FPC reporting period.

In *A/Gb mode*, for each TCH or O-TCH in EPC mode, the received signal
quality shall be measured by the MS in a manner that can be related to
the average BER before channel decoding, assessed over all received
bursts, except bursts carrying a portion of a SACCH frame, during one
EPC reporting period (as specified in subclause 8.4.1b). The MS shall
include all bursts, irrespective of if downlink DTX was applied or not,
when reporting EPC quality. The BSS implementation of uplink EPC quality
measurements is left implementation dependent.

Similarly in *Iu mode*, for each DBPSCH in EPC mode, the received signal
quality shall be measured by the MS in a manner that can be related to
the average BER before channel decoding, assessed over all received
bursts, except bursts carrying a portion of a SACCH frame, during one
EPC reporting period (as specified in subclause 8.4.1b). The MS shall
include all bursts, irrespective of if downlink DTX was applied or not,
when reporting EPC quality. The BSS implementation of uplink EPC quality
measurements is left implementation dependent.

For example, the measurement may be made as part of the channel
equalization process, decoding process, pseudo‑error rate measurement
etc.

NOTE 1: Bursts carrying SACCH are excluded from the measurements in EPC
mode, since the interleaving depth of the SACCH frame is longer than the
EPC reporting period and the inclusion of SACCH therefore would preclude
the use of pseudo-error rate measurements.

NOTE 2: Since all downlink bursts are measured by the MS, EPC quality
reports that are affected by downlink DTX may not be correct.

For MEAN\_BEP and CV\_BEP reporting purposes, the received signal
quality for each channel shall be measured on a burst-by-burst basis by
the MS and BSS in a manner that can be related to the BEP (Bit Error
Probability) for each burst before channel decoding using, for example,
soft output from the receiver. For EC-GSM-IoT, the BEP for a given burst
shall be measured after the combination of all blind physical layer
transmissions of that burst.

### 8.2.3 Statistical parameters

#### 8.2.3.1 RXQUAL

For each channel, the measured parameters (RXQUAL) shall be the received
signal quality, averaged on that channel over the reporting period of
length one SACCH multiframe defined in subclause 8.4. In averaging,
measurements made during previous reporting periods shall always be
discarded.

Contrary to RXLEV measurements, in calculating RXQUAL values,
measurements on bursts on the BCCH carrier shall always be included in
the averaging process.

For E-TCH the average BER shall for every FPC reporting period be mapped
to the RXQUAL scale according to chapter 8.2.4, producing the parameter
RXQUAL\_FAST which is reported to the network via E-IACCH.

In *A/Gb mode*, for each TCH or O-TCH in EPC mode, the average BER shall
for every EPC reporting period be mapped to the RXQUAL scale according
to chapter 8.2.4, producing the parameter RXQUAL\_EPC. RXQUAL\_EPC is
reported to the network in an EPC Downlink Quality Report via EPCCH, as
specified in subclause 8.4.1b.

Similarly in *Iu mode*, for each DBPSCH in EPC mode, the average BER
shall for every EPC reporting period be mapped to the RXQUAL scale
according to chapter 8.2.4, producing the parameter RXQUAL\_EPC.
RXQUAL\_EPC is reported to the network in an EPC Downlink Quality Report
via EPCCH, as specified in subclause 8.4.1b.

#### 8.2.3.2 MEAN\_ BEP and CV\_BEP

In *A/Gb mode*, for TCH, E-TCH, O-TCH, FACCH and O-FACCH, and in *Iu
mode*, for TCH, E-TCH, O-TCH, FACCH, O-FACCH, PDTCH on DBPSCH, the MS
shall calculate the mean bit error probability and the coefficient of
variation of the bit error probability as defined below for the last 4
consecutive slots of each fully received and correctly decoded block
(see subclause 8.4.8.2) and for all SDCCH and SACCH blocks. The
coefficient of variation of the bit error probability is not calculated
for SACCH/T blocks.

Note: The coefficient of variation of the bit error probability is of
less interest in the SACCH/T case as the four SACCH bursts are
non-consecutive.

For FLO in *Iu mode*, the MS shall calculate the mean bit error
probability and the coefficient of variation of the bit error
probability as defined below for the last 4 consecutive slots of each
fully received and correctly decoded radio packet on DBPSCH. When a
radio packet is received with a TFC for which at least one transport
channel that uses a CRC is active, the radio packet is considered as
correctly decoded if at least one CRC is correct. When a radio packet is
received with a TFC where no transport channel uses a CRC, the radio
packet is always considered as correctly decoded.

\- Mean Bit Error Probability (BEP) of the block:

\- Coefficient of variation of the Bit Error Probability of the block:

Note: The receiver needs to detect if a block (or radio packet in case
of FLO) has been fully received (i.e. estimate whether it was fully
transmitted) when DTX is used because a block (or radio packet in case
of FLO) may be correctly decoded even if the last 4 slots were actually
not transmitted, especially in the case of 19 interleaving.

The calculated values shall be averaged (on a linear scale) over the
reporting period as follows:

\- MEAN\_BEP = average of MEAN\_BEP~block~.

\- CV\_BEP = average of CV\_BEP~block~.

In averaging, measurements made during previous reporting periods shall
always be discarded.

For EGPRS, the MS shall calculate the following values for each radio
block (4 bursts) addressed to it:

\- Mean Bit Error Probability (BEP) of a radio block:

\- Coefficient of variation of the Bit Error Probability of a radio
block:

An MS that has enabled EC operation shall calculate MEAN\_BEP and
CV\_BEP as defined for EGPRS, using the four burst BEP values measured
after the respective combination of the blind physical layer
transmissions of each burst (see subclause 8.2.2).

Filtering and reporting are described in subclause 10.2.3.2.

### 8.2.4 Range of parameter RXQUAL

When the quality is assessed over the full‑set and sub‑set of frames
defined in subclause 8.4, eight levels of RXQUAL are defined and shall
be mapped to the equivalent BER before channel decoding as follows:

RXQUAL\_0 BER \< 0,2 % Assumed value = 0,14 %\
RXQUAL\_1 0,2 % \< BER \< 0,4 % Assumed value = 0,28 %\
RXQUAL\_2 0,4 % \< BER \< 0,8 % Assumed value = 0,57 %\
RXQUAL\_3 0,8 % \< BER \< 1,6 % Assumed value = 1,13 %\
RXQUAL\_4 1,6 % \< BER \< 3,2 % Assumed value = 2,26 %\
RXQUAL\_5 3,2 % \< BER \< 6,4 % Assumed value = 4,53 %\
RXQUAL\_6 6,4 % \< BER \< 12,8 % Assumed value = 9,05 %\
RXQUAL\_7 12,8 % \< BER Assumed value = 18,10 %

The assumed values may be employed in any averaging process applied to
RXQUAL.

The same mapping table applies also for RXQUAL\_FAST and RXQUAL\_EPC.

The BER values used to define a quality band are the estimated error
probabilities before channel decoding, averaged over the full set or sub
set of TDMA frames as defined in subclause 8.4. The accuracy to which an
MS shall be capable of estimating the error probabilities under static
channel conditions is given in the following table. Note the exceptions
of subclause 8.4 on some data traffic channels and PDTCH.

The accuracy to which an MS shall be capable of estimating the error
probabilities under TU50 channel conditions is given in the following
table. Note the exception of subclause 8.4 on data channels using
interleaving depth 19, on half rate speech channel, and on PDTCH.

  --------------------- ----------------------- -----------------------------------------------------------------
  Range of actual BER   Expected RXQUAL\_FULL   Probability that expected RXQUAL\_FULL is reported shall exceed
  Less than 0,1 %       RXQUAL\_0/1             85 %
  0,26 % to 0,30 %      RXQUAL\_1/0/2           85 %
  0,51 % to 0,64 %      RXQUAL\_2/1/3           85 %
  1,0 % to 1,3 %        RXQUAL\_3/2/4           75 %
  1,9 % to 2,7 %        RXQUAL\_4/3/5           75 %

For channels operating in VAMOS mode, the same RXQUAL accuracy
requirements as for channels in non-VAMOS mode shall apply. The
requirements for VAMOS mode shall apply for values of SCPIR from -4 dB
to +4 dB for mobile stations indicating support of VAMOS I and for
values of SCPIR from -10 dB to +10 dB for mobile stations indicating
support of VAMOS II or VAMOS III (see 3GPP TS 24.008).

It should be noted that in the testing, the System Simulator (SS) or
(BSSTE) Base Station System Test Equipment will have to measure the
average error rate over a large number of TDMA frames.

### 8.2.5 Range of parameters MEAN\_BEP and CV\_BEP

The mapping of the MEAN\_BEP to the equivalent BEP and the accuracies to
which an MS shall be capable of estimating the quality parameters under
static channel conditions are given in the following tables for GMSK,
8-PSK and AQPSK respectively. The accuracy requirements below apply for
sensitivity limited operation for signal levels above the reference
sensitivity level for the type of MS, assuming no changes in transmitted
downlink power. In *A/Gb mode*, the requirements apply for full rate
TCH, E-TCH and O-TCH (no DTX). Similarly in *Iu mode,* the requirements
apply to DBPSCH/F (no DTX). The estimated values are averaged (cf.
subclause 8.2.3.2) over the reporting period of length 104 TDMA frames
(480 ms). Furthermore, in both *A/Gb mode* and *Iu mode*, different
requirements are given for EGPRS, in which case filtering according to
subclause 10.2.3.2.1 with forgetting factor of 0.03 is assumed. The
requirements for VAMOS mode shall apply for values of SCPIR from -4 dB
to +4 dB for VAMOS I and for values of SCPIR from -10 dB to +10 dB for
VAMOS II and VAMOS III.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------- --------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For a coding on 4 bits, the 4 most significant bits are used.

NOTE1: MEAN\_BEP is calculated and filtered in a linear scale but mapped
to a logarithmic scale for reporting.

NOTE2: The accuracy requirements above take into account possible
fluctuations of the bit error rate due to adaptiveness of receivers.

NOTE3: Testing requires measurement of the actual bit error rate and
assessment of MEAN\_BEP reports based on the same period of time.

The mapping table for the coefficient of variation of the channel
quality is defined as follows for AQPSK, 8-PSK and GMSK:

  ----------- ------ --------------- ------
  CV\_BEP 0   2.00   \> CV\_BEP \>   1.75
  CV\_BEP 1   1.75   \> CV\_BEP \>   1.50
  CV\_BEP 2   1.50   \> CV\_BEP \>   1.25
  CV\_BEP 3   1.25   \> CV\_BEP \>   1.00
  CV\_BEP 4   1.00   \> CV\_BEP \>   0.75
  CV\_BEP 5   0.75   \> CV\_BEP \>   0.50
  CV\_BEP 6   0.50   \> CV\_BEP \>   0.25
  CV\_BEP 7   0.25   \> CV\_BEP \>   0.00
  ----------- ------ --------------- ------

The accuracy requirements for CV\_BEP need not be specified since they
are directly linked to those for MEAN\_BEP. Nevertheless, the CV\_BEP
measured at the MS shall be the one used by this MS.

8.3 Aspects of discontinuous transmission (DTX)
-----------------------------------------------

When DTX is employed on a TCH, not all TDMA frames may be transmitted.
However, the following subset shall always be transmitted, except for
TCH/AFS, TCH/WFS, O-TCH/WFS, TCH/AHS, O-TCH/AHS and O-TCH/WHS, and hence
can be employed to assess quality and signal level during DTX.

  ---------------------------------- --------------------------------------------
  Type of channel                    TDMA frame subset always to be transmitted
                                     TDMA frame number (FN) modulo 104
  TCH/F                              52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59

  TCH/HS,subchannel 1                14, 16, 18, 20, 66, 68, 70, 72
  TCH/H,data,subchannel 0,uplink     52, 54, 56, 58, 60, 62, 65, 67, 69, 71
  TCH/H,data,subchannel 0,downlink   56, 58, 60, 62, 65, 67, 69, 71, 73, 75
  TCH/H,data,subchannel 1,uplink     70, 72, 74, 76, 79, 81, 83, 85, 87, 89
  TCH/H,data,subchannel 1,downlink   66, 68, 70, 72, 74, 76, 79, 81, 83, 85
  ---------------------------------- --------------------------------------------

This subset of TDMA frames is always used for transmission during DTX.
For speech TCH, when no signalling or speech is to be transmitted these
TDMA frames are occupied by the SID (Silence Descriptor) frame, see 3GPP
TS 46.012 and 3GPP TS 46.031 for detailed specification of the SID frame
and its transmission requirements. For data TCH when no information is
required to be transmitted, the L2 fill frame (see 3GPP TS 44.006
subclause 5.4.2.3) shall be transmitted as a FACCH in the TDMA frame
subset always to be transmitted. For PDTCH on DBPSCH in *Iu mode*, when
no information is required to be transmitted a dummy block shall be sent
as a PACCH in the TDMA frame subset always to be transmitted.

On the SDCCH and on the half rate traffic channel TCH/H in signalling
only mode DTX is not allowed. In these cases and on the TCH/F in
signalling only mode when DTX is not used, the same L2 fill frame shall
be transmitted in case there is nothing else to transmit.

On TCH/AFS, TCH/WFS, O-TCH/WFS, TCH/AHS, O-TCH/AHS and O-TCH/WHS, there
is no fixed subset of TDMA frames that will always be transmitted during
DTX. A detection algorithm is required in the receiver which informs
about whether a SID\_UPDATE (see 3GPP TS 45.003 and 3GPP TS 26.093)
frame was transmitted (and thus can be used for quality and signal level
estimation) or not.

If no FPC commands are received during a reporting period, the SACCH
power command shall be used.

In *Iu mode*, when DTX is employed on a DBPSCH with PDTCH or FLO, not
all TDMA frames may be transmitted. However a minimum number of blocks
shall always be transmitted during DTX. When nothing but SACCH blocks
are transmitted (hereafter referred to as silent period), the following
rules ensure that L2 dummy blocks are at least transmitted, according to
the configuration of the DBPSCH:

\- when 4 bursts rectangular interleaving is used on DBPSCH/F (PDTCH/F
or FLO), a L2 dummy block shall be sent after every silent period of 44
TDMA frames, excluding SACCH and idle frames (i.e. 220ms).

\- when 8 bursts diagonal interleaving is used on DBPSCH/F (FLO), a L2
dummy block shall be sent after every silent period of 40 TDMA frames,
excluding SACCH and idle frames (i.e. 200ms).

\- when 4 bursts rectangular interleaving is used on DBPSCH/H (PDTCH/H
or FLO), or when 4 bursts diagonal interleaving is used on DBPSCH/H
(FLO), a L2 dummy block shall be sent after every silent period of 20
TDMA frames, excluding SACCH and idle frames (i.e. 200ms).

8.4 Measurement reporting
-------------------------

### 8.4.1 Measurement reporting for the MS

In *A/Gb mode*, and in *Iu mode*, for a DBPSCH, the reporting period of
length 104 TDMA frames (480 ms) for a mobile station not indicating
support for VAMOS is defined in terms of TDMA frame numbers (FN)
according to table 8.4-2.

In *A/Gb mode*, for a mobile station indicating support for VAMOS the
reporting period and the mapping of the SACCH message block for a TCH is
dependent on the VAMOS mobile support level and the TSC set assigned
according to table 8.4-1.

indicating support for VAMOS.

For a multislot configuration, the reporting period and SACCH Message
block for each timeslot is defined as for TCH/F or PDTCH/F or DBPSCH/F
for TN = 0.

In *A/Gb mode*, when on a TCH, or in *Iu mode*, when on a DBPSCH, the MS
shall assess during the reporting period and transmit to the BSS in the
next SACCH message block the following:

‑ RXLEV for the BCCH carrier of the 6 cells with the highest RXLEV among
those with known and allowed NCC part of BSIC. For a multi band MS the
number of cells, for each frequency band supported, which shall be
included is specified in subclause 8.4.3. For a cell of other radio
access technology, see subclauses 8.1.5 and 8.4.7.

NOTE 1: Since there are 104 TDMA frames in each SACCH multiframe (and
measurement in 4 frames is optional), the number of samples on each BCCH
carrier will depend on the number of carriers defined in the BCCH
Allocation (BA) and may be different. The following table gives examples
of this.

Table 8.4-4. Number of samples per carrier in SACCH multiframe.

  ------------------------- -----------------------------
  Number of BCCH carriers   Number of samples per
  in BCCH Allocation        carrier in SACCH multiframe

  :                         :
  ------------------------- -----------------------------

These figures are increased if the MS is able to make measurements on
more than one BCCH carrier during each TDMA frame.

‑ RXLEV\_FULL and RXQUAL\_FULL:\
In *A/Gb mode,* RXLEV and RXQUAL for the full set of TCH and SACCH TDMA
frames. The full set of TDMA frames is either 100 (i.e. 104 ‑ 4 idle)
frames for a full rate TCH or 52 frames for a half‑rate TCH. Similarly
in *Iu mode* on DBPSCH*,* RXLEV and RXQUAL for the full set of TDMA
frames. The full set of TDMA frames is either 100 frames for a full rate
DBPSCH or 52 frames for a half-rate DBPSCH.

‑ RXLEV\_SUB and RXQUAL\_SUB:\
RXLEV and RXQUAL for the subset of 4 SACCH frames and the SID TDMA
frames/ SID\_UPDATE frames/L2 fill frames/dummy blocks defined in 8.3.

> In case of data traffic channels TCH/F9.6, TCH/F4.8, TCH/H4.8 and
> TCH/H2.4, the RXQUAL\_SUB report shall include measurements on the

> detected SID\_UPDATE frames in addition to the 4 SACCH frames. The
> performance requirements of subclause 8.2.4 for RXQUAL\_SUB apply only
> for active DTX periods.

NOTE 2: If measurement on the BCCH carrier is not used, the number of
TDMA frames used in the RXLEV averaging process may be lower than the
number of TDMA frames in the set see subclause 8.1.3.

In case of a multislot configuration, the MS shall report the following
according to the definition above:

‑ on the main SACCH: the RXLEV values from the adjacent cells,
RXLEV\_FULL and RXLEV\_SUB from the main channel and the worst
RXQUAL\_FULL values and RXQUAL\_SUB values from the main channel and the
unidirectional channels;

‑ on each other bi‑directional SACCH: the RXLEV values from the adjecent
cells, RXLEV\_FULL, RXLEV\_SUB, RXQUAL\_FULL and RXQUAL\_SUB from the
corresponding channel.

#### 8.4.1a Measurement reporting for the MS in FPC mode

For an E-TCH, the FPC reporting period of length 4 TDMA frames (20 ms)
is defined according to chapter 4.7,

When on an E-TCH using 8PSK for the uplink, the MS shall, in addition to
what is specified in chapter 8.4.1, assess during the FPC reporting
period and transmit to the BSS in the next scheduled FPC inband message
(see chapter 4.7) the following:

\- RXQUAL\_FAST:

> RXQUAL for the set of 4 TDMA frames.

#### 8.4.1b Measurement reporting for the MS in EPC mode

In *A/Gb mode*, for a TCH in enhanced power control (EPC) modeor O-TCH
in enhanced power control (EPC) mode, and in *Iu mode*, for a DBPSCH in
EPC mode, the EPC reporting period of length 26 TDMA frames (120 ms) for
a mobile station not indicating support for VAMOS is defined in terms of
TDMA frame numbers (FN) according to table 8.4-6.

In *A/Gb mode*, for a mobile station indicating support for VAMOS the
EPC reporting period and the mapping of the EPCCH message block is
dependent on the VAMOS mobile support level and the TSC set assigned
according to table 8.4-5.

Table 8.4-5. Mapping of EPCCH message block for a mobile station
indicating support for VAMOS.

  ---------------------- ---------------------------------- -------------------- ------------------ ---------------------

For a multislot configuration, the EPC reporting period and EPCCH
Message block for each timeslot is defined as for a full rate channel
for TN = 0.

In A/Gb mode, for a TCH or O-TCH in EPC mode, and in *Iu mode*, for a
DBPSCH in EPC mode, the MS shall, in addition to what is specified in
subclause 8.4.1, transmit an EPC Downlink Quality Report to the BSS in
each scheduled EPCCH on the uplink, containing the assessed RXQUAL\_EPC
(as specified in subclause 8.2.3.1). During one EPC reporting period,
The RXQUAL\_EPC corresponding to the previous EPC reporting period shall
be reported.

In case of a multislot configuration, the MS shall report the following
according to the definition above:

\- on the main SACCH: the worst RXQUAL\_EPC value from the main channel
and the unidirectional channels;

\- on each other bi‑directional SACCH: the RXQUAL\_EPC from the
corresponding channel.

### 8.4.2 Measurement reporting for the MS on a SDCCH

For a SDCCH, the reporting period of length 102 TDMA frames (470.8 ms)
is defined in terms of TDMA frame numbers (FN) as follows:

  --------- -------------------
            TDMA frame number
            (FN) modulo 102
  SDCCH/8   12 to 11
  SDCCH/4   37 to 36
  --------- -------------------

NOTE 1: Some SDCCH data or TCH speech, data or SID message blocks are
spread over two reporting periods. In these cases, the RXLEV and/or
RXQUAL information from the SDCCH or TCH message blocks may either be
sent as part of the measurement report of the second period, or shared
between the reports of the two periods.

When on a SDCCH, the MS shall assess during the reporting period and
transmit to the BSS in the next SACCH message block the following:

\- RXLEV for the BCCH carrier of the 6 cells with the highest RXLEV
among those with known and allowed NCC part of BSIC. For a multi band MS
the number of cells, for each frequency band supported, which shall be
included is specified in subclause 8.4.3. For a cell of other radio
access technology, see subclauses 8.1.5 and 8.4.7.

NOTE 2: With only 102 TDMA frames in each SACCH multiframe, the number
of samples used to calculate RXLEV per BCCH carrier may be slightly
different from the case of TCH described above.

\- RXLEV and RXQUAL for the full set of 12 (8 SDCCH and 4 SACCH) frames
within the reporting period. As DTX is not allowed on the SDCCH, ‑SUB
values are set equal to the ‑FULL values in the SACCH message.

NOTE 3: If measurement on the BCCH carrier is not used, the number of
TDMA frames used in the RXLEV averaging process may be lower than the
number of TDMA frames in the full set see subclause 8.1.3.

### 8.4.3 Additional cell reporting requirements for multi band MS

For a multi band MS the number of cells, for each frequency band
supported, which shall be included in the measurement report is
indicated by the parameter MULTIBAND\_REPORTING, broadcast on BCCH and
PBCCH. An MS attached to GPRS shall use the parameter broadcast on PBCCH
if it exists (See sub-clause 1.4). In all other cases, the MS shall use
the parameter broadcast on BCCH. The parameter may also be sent to the
MS on SACCH.

The meaning of different values of the parameter is specified as
follows:

**Value Meaning**

00 Normal reporting of the six strongest cells, with known and allowed
NCC part of BSIC, irrespective of the band used.

01 The MS shall report the strongest cell, with known and allowed NCC
part of BSIC, in each of the frequency bands in the BA list, excluding
the frequency band of the serving cell. The remaining positions in the
measurement report shall be used for reporting of cells in the band of
the serving cell. If there are still remaining positions, these shall be
used to report the next strongest identified cells in the other bands
irrespective of the band used.

10 The MS shall report the two strongest cells, with known and allowed
NCC part of BSIC, in each of the frequency bands in the BA list,
excluding the frequency band of the serving cell. The remaining
positions in the measurement report shall be used for reporting of cells
in the band of the serving cell. If there are still remaining positions,
these shall be used to report the next strongest identified cells in the
other bands irrespective of the band used.

11 The MS shall report the three strongest cells, with known and allowed
NCC part of BSIC, in each of the frequency bands in the BA list,
excluding the frequency band of the serving cell. The remaining
positions in the measurement report shall be used for reporting of cells
in the band of the serving cell. If there are still remaining positions,
these shall be used to report the next strongest identified cells in the
other bands irrespective of the band used.

### 8.4.4 Common aspects for the MS on a TCH, a SDCCH or a DBPSCH

In *A/Gb mode*, whether the MS is on a TCH or a SDCCH, and in *Iu mode*
when the MS is on a DBPSCH, if an SACCH message block is used for a
different Layer 3 message, the measurement report that would otherwise
be sent in that block is discarded and a new measurement report provided
for the next SACCH message.

The MS shall also transmit a bit (DTX\_USED) in the next SACCH message
block, which indicates whether or not it has employed DTX during the
reporting period. This bit shall be set even if just one burst in a TDMA
frame in the reporting period was not transmitted due to DTX.

NOTE: A speech or user data frame subject to DTX may cross the
\"border\" between two reporting periods, in which case both of the
associated SACCH message blocks will have the DTX\_USED flag set.

The measurements in the MS shall be based on the current BA list and the
current NCC\_PERMITTED (see table 1), available at the beginning of the
reporting period. At the transition from idle mode to a TCH or a SDCCH
the current BA list is the BA(BCCH), later the latest received complete
BA(SACCH). A complete BA(SACCH) for a MS shall be that contained in SI 5
and additionally SI 5bis if the EXT-IND bit in the Neighbour Cell
Description information element in both the SI 5 and SI 5bis messages
indicates that each information element only carries part of the BA. If
a SI 5ter message is subsequently received and not ignored (see 3GPP
TS 44.018) the BA(SACCH) shall be modified accordingly.

At the transition from idle mode to a TCH or a SDCCH in *A/Gb mode*, and
to a DBPSCH in *Iu mode*, the current NCC is the NCC\_PERMITTED received
on the BCCH, later the latest NCC\_PERMITTED received on the SACCH. The
measurement process on carriers contained in both lists is, therefore,
continuous.

If the current BA list does not refer to the serving cell, e.g. after a
handover, this shall be indicated and no measurement values for cells in
the BA list shall be reported.

If the MS returns to the previous cell after a failure of the handover
procedure the description above applies. As a consequence, a BA list
(and/or NCC\_PERMITTED) received on the SACCH in the cell to which the
handover failed shall be regarded as the current ones, which may lead to
interruptions in the measurement reporting as the BA list does not refer
to the serving cell. As an option, the MS may in this case remember the
last received BA list and NCC\_PERMITTED in the old cell and regard
those as the current ones when returning.

What is said in this subclause about the BA list also applies to the GSM
neighbour cell list when using enhanced measurement reporting and to the
3G neighbour cell list for a multi-RAT MS. The rules for building of and
changing between neighbour cell lists are defined in 3GPP TS 44.018.

### 8.4.5 Measurement reporting for the BSS

In *A/Gb mode*, unless otherwise specified by the operator, the BSS
shall make the same RXLEV (full and sub) and RXQUAL (full and sub)
assessments as described for the MS for all TCH\'s and SDCCH\'s assigned
to an MS, using the associated reporting periods. Simlarly in *Iu mode*,
unless otherwise specified by the operator, the BSS shall make the same
RXLEV (full and sub) and RXQUAL (full and sub) assessments as described
for the MS for all DBPSCH\'s assigned to an MS, using the associated
reporting periods. These values, together with the reported values from
the MS, shall be transmitted to the BSC as described in the 3GPP TS
48.058.

### 8.4.6 Extended measurement reporting

When on a TCH or SDCCH in *A/Gb mode*, or when on a DBPSCH in *Iu mode*,
the mobile station may receive an Extended Measurement Order (EMO)
message. The mobile station shall then, during one reporting period,
perform received signal level measurements according to the frequency
list contained in the EMO message. BSIC decoding is not required for
these frequencies. The mobile station shall then transmit the
measurement results in one single Extended Measurement Report message,
containing the following:

\- RXLEV (as defined in subclause 8.1.4) for the carriers specified by
the last received EMO message. If the EMO contains more than 21
carriers, only the 21 first carriers in the sorted EXTENDED MEASUREMENT
FREQUENCY LIST (in the EMO) are measured and reported.

\- DTX USED, as defined in subclause 8.4.4.

NOTE: the position of the signal strength measurement samples performed
by the mobile station, and the duration of these samples are not known
in a TDMA frame. Consequently, in case the signal level on the carrier
the MS has to monitor is not constant, the MS will report as the RXLEV
value, the signal strength measurements performed during its sampling
period. This value can be different from the mean value of the signal
level on the whole frame.

If reporting is not possible due to requirements to send other Layer 3
messages, the measurements shall either be discarded and new
measurements scheduled at the next possible opportunity or saved and
transmitted at the next possible opportunity. If extended measurements
can not be reported within 10 seconds after the triggering EMO was
received, they shall be discarded (and not reported).

If the EMO message contains frequencies outside the MS' frequency band,
the MS shall set the corresponding RXLEV value(s) to zero.

After a successful channel change, no Extended Measurement Report shall
be sent if the EMO was received before that channel change.

After having performed Extended Measurements during one reporting
period, the mobile station shall resume the measurements according to
the current BA list. This applies for each rescheduling of the Extended
measurements.

### 8.4.7 Additional cell reporting requirements for multi-RAT MS

A multi-RAT MS shall report the number of best valid cells, in each
supported other radio access technology/mode in the neighbour cell list
or on frequencies contained in the E-UTRAN Neighbour Cell list,
according to the value of the parameters XXX\_MULTIRAT\_REPORTING (XXX
indicates radio access technology/mode).

For UTRAN FDD, only cells with a reported value (CPICH Ec/No or CPICH
RSCP) equal or higher than FDD\_REPORTING\_THRESHOLD and a non-reported
value (CPICH Ec/No or CPICH RSCP) equal or higher than
FDD\_REPORTING\_THRESHOLD\_2, shall be reported.

For UTRAN TDD, only cells with a reported value (P-CCPCH RSCP) equal or
higher than TDD\_REPORTING\_THRESHOLD shall be reported.

For E-UTRAN FDD or E-UTRAN TDD, when 6-bit measurement reporting is used
only cells with a reported value (RSRP or RSRQ) equal or higher than
E-UTRAN\_FDD\_REPORTING\_THRESHOLD or E-UTRAN\_TDD\_REPORTING\_THRESHOLD
and with a non-reported value (RSRP or RSRQ) equal or higher than
E-UTRAN\_FDD\_REPORTING\_THRESHOLD\_2 or
E-UTRAN\_TDD\_REPORTING\_THRESHOLD\_2, respectively, shall be reported.
When 3-bit measurement reporting is used only cells with a measured
value (RSRP or RSRQ) equal or higher than
E-UTRAN\_FDD\_MEASUREMENT\_REPORT\_OFFSET or
E-UTRAN\_TDD\_MEASUREMENT\_REPORT\_OFFSET and with a non-reported value
(RSRP or RSRQ) equal or higher than
E-UTRAN\_FDD\_REPORTING\_THRESHOLD\_2 or
E-UTRAN\_TDD\_REPORTING\_THRESHOLD\_2, respectively, shall be reported.

If there are more valid non-GSM cells than can be reported, the MS shall
select the cells for each supported RAT/mode for which
XXX\_MULTIRAT\_REPORTING is non-zero according to the following
procedure:

1\. For each RAT/mode the best valid cell of each RAT/mode is included
in the report. The best cell is the cell with the highest reported value
(see subclause 8.1.5).

2 If there are further positions and cells available, the MS shall
additionally include in the report the next best valid cell on each
RAT/mode for which XXX\_MULTIRAT\_REPORTING cells have not yet been
included. In case this would result in including more cells than there
are remaining spaces in the measurement report, priority is given to
cells from RATs/modes with higher XXX\_MULTIRAT\_REPORTING value. In
case of equal XXX\_MULTIRAT\_REPORTING values, the cell for which (6 bit
reported value -- XXX\_REPORTING\_THRESHOLD + XXX\_REPORTING\_OFFSET) is
highest is reported.

> 6 bit mapping for reported values shall be used in the calculations
> even if 3 bit reporting is used. In this case, instead of
> E-UTRAN\_FDD\_REPORTING\_THRESHOLD or
> E-UTRAN\_TDD\_REPORTING\_THRESHOLD the mobile station shall use the 6
> bit mapped value from E-UTRAN\_FDD\_MEASUREMENT\_REPORT\_OFFSET or
> E-UTRAN\_TDD\_MEASUREMENT\_REPORT\_OFFSET respectively, using the
> mapping table defined in subclause 8.1.5.4 for E-UTRAN FDD or
> subclause 8.1.5.5 for E-UTRAN TDD.

3\. Step 2 is repeated until either all positions are used or no more
cells are to be reported (because, for each RAT/mode, either
XXX\_MULTIRAT\_REPORTING cells have been reported, or there are no more
valid cells to report).

The remaining positions in the measurement report shall be used for
reporting of GSM cells as defined in subclause 8.4.3.

If there are still remaining positions, these shall be used to report
the next best valid cells in supported other radio access technologies
for which XXX\_MULTIRAT\_REPORTING is non-zero. The best cell is the
cell with the highest quantity of (6 bit reported value --
XXX\_REPORTING\_THRESHOLD + XXX\_REPORTING\_OFFSET).

If the neighbour cell list contains a UTRAN FDD frequency for RSSI
reporting, an RSSI report on that frequency shall be included when and
only when a cell on that frequency is also reported (RSSI shall be
reported at most once per frequency occurence in the neighbouring cell
list). RSSI measurements for frequencies contained in the neighbour cell
list shall be reported with high priority and shall be reported before
measurements on valid 3G cell, in case of not available positions.

NOTE: The parameter XXX\_MULTIRAT\_REPORTING indicates a number of cells
to be reported in a measurement report message and does not include the
number of places taken by RSSI reporting in the measurement report
message. In the case of E-UTRAN there is only one parameter
E-UTRAN\_MULTIRAT\_REPORTING that indicates the number of cells to be
reported in a measurement report message regardless of mode.

If no measurements have been performed on a cell since last report, the
cell shall not be included in the report.

For UTRAN FDD, valid cells are identified cells where the primary CPICH
has been received when using the scrambling code provided for that
frequency in the neighbour cell list.

For UTRAN TDD, valid cells are identified cells with correct cell
parameter and sync case provided for that frequency in the neighbour
cell list.

For cdma2000, valid cells are identified cells with correct Pilot PN
sequence offset index (PILOT\_PN, as defined in TIA/EIA/IS-2000-A)
provided for that frequency in the neighbour cell list.

For E-UTRAN FDD, valid cells are identified cells on frequencies
included in the E-UTRAN Neighbour Cell list for which the physical-layer
cell identity (see 3GPP TS 36.211) has been correctly detected and is
not included in the list of not allowed cells for that frequency.

For E-UTRAN TDD, valid cells are identified cells on frequencies
included in the E-UTRAN Neighbour Cell list for which the physical-layer
cell identity (see 3GPP TS 36.211) has been correctly detected and is
not included in the list of not allowed cells for that frequency.

The XXX\_MULTIRAT\_REPORTING parameters are broadcast on BCCH and,
except for E-UTRAN parameters, on PBCCH. An MS attached to GPRS shall
use the parameters broadcast on PBCCH if it exists (See sub-clause 1.4).
In all other cases, the MS shall use the parameters broadcast on BCCH.
The parameters may also be sent to the MS on SACCH.

### 8.4.8 Enhanced Measurement Reporting

The network may request the MS to report serving cell and neighbour cell
measurements with Enhanced Measurement Report message by the parameter
REPORT\_TYPE, provided that BSIC for all GSM neighbour cells has been
sent to the MS (See 3GPP TS 44.018). This reporting is referred as
Enhanced Measurement Reporting.

If Enhanced Measurement Reporting is used, the BCCH carriers and
corresponding valid BSICs of the GSM neighbour cells are sent to the MS
within System Information messages and MEASUREMENT INFORMATION message
(See 3GPP TS 44.018). The MEASUREMENT INFORMATION message also includes
the parameters SERVING\_BAND\_REPORTING, MULTIBAND\_REPORTING,
XXX\_MULTIRAT\_REPORTING, XXX\_REPORTING\_THRESHOLD,
XXX\_REPORTING\_OFFSET, REP\_PRIORITY, REPORTING\_RATE,
INVALID\_BSIC\_REPORTING and optionally FDD\_REPORTING\_THRESHOLD\_2,
E-UTRAN\_ FDD\_REPORTING\_THRESHOLD\_2 and
E-UTRAN\_TDD\_REPORTING\_THRESHOLD\_2. XXX indicates, as applicable, GSM
frequency band (e.g. 900, 850, etc) or other radio access
technology/mode (e.g. FDD, TDD, E-UTRAN, E-UTRAN FDD, E-UTRAN TDD).

Only GSM cells with the valid BSIC shall be reported unless otherwise
stated.

#### 8.4.8.1 Reporting Priority

The MS shall include the neighbour cell measurement results using the
following priority order:

1\) the number of strongest GSM cells with known and valid BSIC and with
a reported value equal or greater than XXX\_REPORTING\_THRESHOLD, in the
frequency band of the serving cell, according to the value of the
parameter SERVING\_BAND\_REPORTING;

2\) the number of strongest GSM cells with known and valid BSIC and with
a reported value equal or greater than XXX\_REPORTING\_THRESHOLD, in
each of the frequency bands in the BA list, excluding the frequency band
of the serving cell, according to the value of the parameter
MULTIBAND\_REPORTING;

3\) the number of best valid cells and with a reported value equal or
greater than XXX\_REPORTING\_THRESHOLD, in each supported other radio
access technology/mode in the 3G neighbour cell list or on frequencies
contained in the E-UTRAN Neighbour Cell list, according to the value of
the parameters XXX\_MULTIRAT\_REPORTING. When the radio access
technology/mode is UTRAN FDD, then additionally the non-reported value
(from CPICH Ec/No and CPICH RSCP) shall be equal or greater than
FDD\_REPORTING\_THRESHOLD\_2. When the radio access technology/mode is
E-UTRAN FDD or E‑UTRAN TDD, then additionally the non-reported value
(from RSRP and RSRQ) shall be equal or greater than
E-UTRAN\_FDD\_REPORTING\_THRESHOLD\_2 or
E‑UTRAN\_TDD\_REPORTING\_THRESHOLD\_2, respectively. A valid cell is
defined in subclause 8.4.7.

4\) The remaining GSM cells with known and valid BSIC or, if indicated
by the parameter INVALID\_BSIC\_REPORTING, with known and allowed NCC
part of the BSIC in any frequency band and valid cells of other radio
access technologies for which XXX\_MULTIRAT\_REPORTING is greater than
zero. Except for cells with high reporting priority as indicated with by
the parameter REP\_PRIORITY, these cells may be reported less
frequently, if indicated by the parameter REPORTING\_RATE, but at least
once in four consecutive measurement reports. For those cells that are
not reported in every measurement report, the MS shall average the
measurements of the current and the previous reporting period (i.e. over
two reporting periods).

For UTRAN FDD cells within this priority level the non-reported value
shall be equal or greater than FDD\_REPORTING\_THRESHOLD\_2.

For E-UTRAN FDD and E-UTRAN TDD cells within this priority level the
non-reported value shall be equal or greater than
E-UTRAN\_FDD\_REPORTING\_THRESHOLD\_2 or
E‑UTRAN\_TDD\_REPORTING\_THRESHOLD\_2 respectively.

If the neighbour cell list contains a UTRAN frequency for which RSSI
shall be reported, that report shall be included whenever a cell on that
frequency is reported, as described in 8.4.7.

For each of the priority levels above, the following shall apply:

\- if the number of valid cells is less than indicated the unused
positions in the report shall be left for the lower prioritised cells;

\- if there is not enough space in the report for all valid cells, the
cells shall be reported for which the quantity (reported value --
XXX\_REPORTING\_THRESHOLD + XXX\_REPORTING\_OFFSET) is highest, where
the parameters XXX\_REPORTING\_THRESHOLD and XXX\_REPORTING\_OFFSET are
for the respective radio access technology/mode. Note that this
parameter shall not affect the actual reported value. If a cell can not
be reported due to lack of space in the report, then no cell with a
lower value shall be reported, even if one of these cells with a lower
value would fit in the report.

#### 8.4.8.2 Measurement Reporting

The reporting period shall be as specified in 8.4.1 for the MS on a TCH
in *A/Gb mode* and for the MS on a DBPSCH in *Iu mode*, and as specified
in 8.4.2 for the MS on a SDCCH.

When on a TCH in *A/Gb mode*, or on a DBPSCH in *Iu mode*, the MS shall
assess during the reporting period and transmit to the BSS in the next
SACCH message block the following:

\- RXLEV for neighbour cells in the order defined in 8.4.8.1. For a cell
of other radio access technology, see subclause 8.1.5.

\- RXQUAL\_FULL:\
In *A/Gb mode*, RXQUAL for the full set of TCH and SACCH TDMA frames.
The full set of TDMA frames is either 100 (i.e. 104 ‑ 4 idle) frames for
a full rate TCH or 52 frames for a half‑rate TCH. In *Iu mode*, RXQUAL
for the full set of TDMA frames on DBPSCH. The full set of TDMA frames
is either 100 (i.e. 104 ‑ 4 idle) frames for a full rate DBPSCH or 52
frames for a half‑rate DBPSCH.

\- RXLEV\_VAL:\
The average over the reporting period of RXLEV measured on the 4 last
time slots of each fully received and correctly decoded data block (as
defined for MEAN\_BEP and CV\_BEP in 8.2.3.2) and on all SACCH frames.
For speech traffic channels, blocks that have not been erased, shall be
considered as correctly decoded. For non-transparent data, blocks are
considered as correctly decoded according the CRC received. For
transparent data, all blocks are considered as correctly decoded. FACCH
blocks are considered as correctly decoded according to the CRC.

\- MEAN\_BEP and CV\_BEP:\
The average over the reporting period of the Mean and Coefficient of
Variation of the Bit Error Probability measures from blocks as defined
for RXLEV\_VAL above, excluding CV\_BEP~block~ measurements from SACCH/T
blocks (see subclause 8.2.3).

\- NBR\_RCVD\_BLOCKS:\
The number of correctly decoded blocks, as defined for RXLEV\_VAL,
(excluding all SID frames, RATSCCH, SACCH, PACCH and FACCH blocks) that
were completed during the measurement report period. As an exception,
FACCH or PACCH blocks shall be included in the case of signalling only
mode. For FLO in *Iu mode*, the procedure for reporting the number of
correctly decoded transport blocks is defined in subclause 8.4.8.3.

NOTE: In some cases more than one data frame needs to be received in
order to identify a block as correctly decoded, e.g. for 14.4 data where
one RLP frame consists of two consecutive blocks. In some cases a single
block carries multiple RLP frames in which case it is sufficient that
one of those RLP frames is correctly received.

\- BSIC\_SEEN:\
Indicates if a GSM cell with invalid BSIC and allowed NCC part of the
BSIC is one of the six strongest cells.

In case of a multislot configuration the MS shall report the following
according to the definition above:

\- on the main SACCH: the RXLEV values from the adjacent cells,
BSIC\_SEEN, RXLEV\_VAL and NBR\_RCVD\_BLOCKS from the main channel, the
worst RXQUAL\_FULL value and the worst MEAN\_BEP value from the main
channel and the unidirectional channels and the CV\_BEP value from the
same channel as the reported MEAN\_BEP;

\- on each other bi‑directional SACCH: the RXLEV values from the
adjacent cells, BSIC\_SEEN, RXLEV\_VAL, NBR\_RCVD\_BLOCKS, RXQUAL\_FULL,
MEAN\_BEP and CV\_BEP from the corresponding channel.

When on a SDCCH, the MS shall assess during the reporting period and
transmit to the BSS in the next SACCH message block the following:

\- RXLEV for neighbour cells as defined in 8.4.8.1. For a cell of other
radio access technology, see subclause 8.1.5.

\- RXLEV\_VAL, NBR\_RCVD\_BLOCKS, RXQUAL\_FULL, MEAN\_BEP and CV\_BEP
for the full set of 12 (8 SDCCH and 4 SACCH) TDMA frames within the
reporting period. As DTX is not allowed on the SDCCH, measurements on
all 12 TDMA frames shall be included.

\- BSIC\_SEEN:\
Indicates if a GSM cell with invalid BSIC and allowed NCC part of the
BSIC is one of the six strongest cells.

The common aspects for the MS on a TCH or a SDCCH as defined in 8.4.4
shall apply.

#### 8.4.8.3 NBR\_RCVD\_BLOCKS for FLO

For reporting the number of correctly decoded transport blocks during a
reporting period, the MS shall calculate the maximum number of transport
blocks that can be correctly decoded during that reporting period
(NbTB~max~).

NbTB~max~ is 24 × the maximum number of active transport channels (for
which a CRC is used) in a TFC of the TFCS (excluding the signalling TFC)
of the DBPSCH. If the TFCS (excluding the signalling TFC) does not
contain a TFC for which at least one transport channel that uses a CRC
is active, NbTB~max~ becomes 24 × the maximum number of active transport
channel in a TFC of the TFCS (excluding the signalling TFC).

If during a reporting period, the TFCS is reconfigured by higher layers,
NbTB~max~ shall be the highest one among the TFCSs used during the
reporting period.

When counting the correctly decoded transport blocks, the MS shall apply
the two following principles:

\- when a radio packet is received with the signalling TFC (the first
one, the one for which the TFCI=0), the transport block(s) it carries
is(are) not counted; and

\- transport blocks are considered as correctly decoded according the
CRC received. If there is no CRC, the transport block is not counted
unless the TFCS (excluding the signalling TFC) does not contain a TFC
for which at least one transport channel that uses a CRC is active, in
which case all received transport blocks are considered as correctly
decoded.

NBR\_RCVD\_BLOCKS is obtained by truncating the least significant bit(s)
of the binary representation of the number of correctly decoded
transport blocks according to the table below:

Table 8.4.8.2: Truncation

  --------- ------------
  NbTBmax   Truncation
  0 -31     none
  32 -63    1 LSB
  \> 63     2 LSB
  --------- ------------

### 8.4.9 Requirements for measurement and reporting of CSG cells and hybrid cells

The requirements in subclause 8.4.7 and 8.4.8 do not apply for the
reporting of CSG cells, but the MS shall apply the rules in this
subclause. A cell detected as hybrid cell which meets the criteria
specified in subclause 7.4 or 10.1a shall be treated as a CSG cell for
the purpose of this sub-clause; , otherwise, in respect of that cell,
the rules for reporting of non-CSG cells defined in subclause 8.4.7 and
8.4.8 shall apply.

If the criteria for reporting of a CSG cell are met (see subclause 7.4
and 10.1a), the MS shall report that cell with highest priority, except
that: i) a mobile station shall transmit a measurement report for a
given CSG cell at most 6 times in any 60 second period (in dedicated
mode or dual transfer mode) or at most 6 times in any 50 consecutive
reporting periods (in packet idle mode or packet transfer mode); ii) a
mobile station shall transmit a measurement report for any CSG cell at
most 12 times in any 60 second period (in dedicated mode or dual
transfer mode) or at most 12 times in any consecutive 50 reporting
periods (in packet idle mode or packet transfer mode). The mobile
station may exceed these limits and transmit additional reports for a
CSG cell if there is space in the report to include the report for the
CSG cell together with reports for all other valid cells (see
sub-clauses 8.4.7 and 8.4.8). No more than one CSG cell shall be
included in any measurement reporting message. Reporting priority
between CSG cells of different RATs/modes or CSG cells from different
frequencies is left implementation dependent. If there is still space in
the report, the MS shall include valid neighour non-CSG cells according
to the rules defined in subclause 8.4.7 and 8.4.8.

NOTE: The autonomous search function used to detect a CSG cell is
implementation dependent and no performance requirements apply for this
function while the mobile station is in dedicated mode, packet transfer
mode or dual transfer mode.

For UTRAN FDD CSG cells, the measurement quantities to be used are CPICH
Ec/No and CPICH RSCP and their mappings are the same as for UTRAN FDD
cells (see subclause 8.1.5.1). Ec/No shall be used for measurement
reporting irrespective of the parameter FDD\_REP\_QUANT.

For UTRAN TDD CSG cells, the measurement quantity to be used is P-CCPCH
RSCP and its mapping is the same as for UTRAN TDD cells (see subclause
8.1.5.2). RSCP shall be used for measurement reporting.

For E-UTRAN FDD CSG cells, the measurement quantities to be used are
RSRQ and RSRP and their mappings are the same as for E-UTRAN FDD cells
(see subclause 8.1.5.4). RSRQ shall be used for measurement reporting
irrespective of the parameter E-UTRA\_REP\_QUANT.

For E-UTRAN TDD CSG cells, the measurement quantities to be used are
RSRQ and RSRP and their mappings are the same as for UTRAN TDD cells
(see subclause 8.1.5.4). RSRQ shall be used for measurement reporting
irrespective of the parameter E-UTRA\_REP\_QUANT.

8.5 Absolute MS‑BTS distance
----------------------------

### 8.5.1 General

The Absolute MS‑BTS distance may be employed by the network as a
criterion in the handover processes.

### 8.5.2 Physical parameter

The information being used by the BSS to perform \"adaptive frame
alignment\" (3GPP TS 45.010) in the MS is a representation of the
absolute distance of the MS to the serving BTS.

This absolute distance may be used by the BSS to prevent MS from grossly
exceeding the planned cell boundaries.

The allowable distance is administered on a cell by cell basis by the
network operator.

For an *Iu mode* capable MS, if all the following conditions are met,
then the \"Cell selection priority\" and the \"Status for cell
reselection\" shall be set to normal (*Iu mode*):

> ‑ the cell belongs to the MS HPLMN if no EHPLMN list is available or
> is empty, or the cell belongs to any PLMN defined in the EHPLMN list;\
> ‑ the MS is in cell test operation mode;\
> ‑ the CELL\_BAR\_QUALIFY\_3 is set to \"01\";\
> ‑ the Access Control class 15 is barred;

Otherwise, if the MS is *A/Gb mode* capable, if all the following
conditions are met, then the \"Cell selection priority\" and the
\"Status for cell reselection\" shall be set to normal (*A/Gb mode*):

‑ the cell belongs to the MS HPLMN if no EHPLMN list is available or is
empty, or the cell belongs to any PLMN defined in the EHPLMN list;\
‑ the MS is in cell test operation mode;\
‑ the CELL\_BAR\_ACCESS is set to \"1\";\
‑ the CELL\_BAR\_QUALIFY is set to \"0\";\
‑ the Access Control class 15 is barred.

NOTE 1: A low priority cell is only selected if there are no suitable
cells of normal priority (see 3GPP TS 43.022).

NOTE 2: Two identical semantics are used for cross phase compatibility
reasons. This allows an operator to declare a cell always as a low
priority one for a phase 2 MS, but keeps the opportunity for an operator
to decide whether a phase 1 MS is permitted to camp on such a cell or
not.

NOTE 3: void

NOTE 4: *Iu mode* not supported.

NOTE 5: The cell is barred against the MSs supporting *Iu mode*.

NOTE 6: *Iu mode* supported and the *Iu mode* capable MS shall access
*Iu mode*.

NOTE 7: In case an optional parameter is not included in a
point-to-point signalling message, the default value of that parameter
shall replace any previously broadcast value, where applicable.

10 GPRS mode tasks
==================

10.1 Cell Re-selection
----------------------

### 10.1.0 General

In *A/Gb mode*, in GMM Standby and GMM Ready states, cell re-selection
is performed by the MS, except when the MS has an ongoing circuit
switched connection (e.g. while in dual transfer mode), in which case
the cell is determined by the network according to the handover
procedures (see subclause 3). When the circuit switched connection is
released, the MS shall resume cell re-selection (see subclause 6.7.1).

In *Iu mode*, in RRC-Idle and RRC-Connected modes, cell re-selection is
performed by the MS, except while in RRC-Cell\_Dedicated state, in which
case the cell is determined by the network according to the handover
procedures (see subclause 3). When the MS leaves the RRC-Cell\_Dedicated
state, the MS shall resume cell re-selection (see subclause 6.7.1).

The cell re-selection procedures defined in subclauses 10.1.1 to 10.1.3
apply in *A/Gb mode* to the MSs attached to GPRS if a PBCCH exists in
the serving cell (See sub-clause 1.4). In *Iu mode* these procedures
apply always.

In *A/Gb mode,* if PBCCH does not exist, the criteria and algorithms
defined in subclauses 10.1.2 and 10.1.3 shall also apply if one or more
cells are provided to the MS in a Packet Cell Change Order or Packet
Measurement Order message (3GPP TS 44.060 \[19\]). In this case, the MS
shall convert the idle mode cell re-selection parameters, received for
the other cells according to clause 6, to GPRS cell re-selection
parameters according to table 3a and use the same procedures, except
that the MS may measure received signal strength in packet idle mode
according to either subclause 6.6.1 or subclause 10.1.1.

Otherwise the MS shall perform cell re-selection according to the idle
mode procedures defined in clause 6, except that the MS is only required
to monitor full system information on BCCH of the serving cell if
indicated by change mark on BCCH or PACCH. A MS that has enabled PEO is
only required to monitor system information on BCCH of the serving cell
if indicated by the PEO\_BCCH\_CHANGE\_MARK field in a PCH/AGCH message
or the time elapsed since it last read SI13 exceeds 24 hours (see 3GPP
TS 44.018 \[17\]). A MS that has enabled EC operation is only required
to monitor full system information on EC-BCCH of the serving cell if
indicated by the EC-BCCH CHANGE MARK field sent as part of EC-SCH (see
3GPP TS 45.002 \[22\]) or the time elapsed since it last read the
complete EC SI message set exceeds 24 hours (see 3GPP TS 44.018 \[17\]).
If PBCCH exists, the MS is not required to monitor system information on
BCCH of the serving cell or any system information of the non-serving
cells and only required to monitor system information on PBCCH of the
serving cell if indicated by change mark on PBCCH, PCCCH or PACCH.

For both cases (with or without PBCCH), the details of system
information monitoring are specified in 3GPP TS 44.060 \[19\].

In packet transfer mode, broadcast/multicast receive mode or MAC-Shared
state, the MS shall always measure received signal strength according to
subclause 10.1.1.

The cells to be monitored for cell re-selection are defined in the
BA(GPRS) list, which is broadcast on PBCCH. If PBCCH does not exist,
BA(GPRS) is equal to BA(BCCH).

In addition, the network may control the cell selection as defined in
subclause 10.1.4.

For a multi-RAT MS, cell re-selection to other radio access technologies
shall also be possible. If PBCCH exists, the procedures in subclause
10.1.1.3, 10.1.3.2 and 10.1.3.3 shall apply. In *A/Gb mode*, if PBCCH
does not exist, the criteria and algorithms defined in subclauses
10.1.1.3, 10.1.3.2 and 10.1.3.3 shall also apply if GPRS cell
re-selection parameters for one or more cells are provided to the MS in
a Packet Cell Change Order or Packet Measurement Order message;
otherwise the idle mode procedures in subclause 6 shall apply.

### 10.1.1 Monitoring the received signal level and PBCCH data

#### 10.1.1.0 General

The MS shall measure the received RF signal level on the BCCH carriers
of the serving cell and the surrounding cells as indicated in the
BA(GPRS) list and optionally the NC\_FREQUENCY\_LIST, and calculate the
received level average (RLA\_P) for each carrier.

In addition the MS shall verify the BSIC of the BCCH carriers. Only
cells with allowed BSIC shall be considered for re-selection. The
allowed BSIC is either a valid BSIC or, for cells in BA(BCCH) where no
BSIC is broadcast, a BSIC with allowed NCC part (see subclause 7.2). A
valid BSIC is a BSIC broadcast for that carrier in the BA(GPRS) list.
For an MS supporting network sharing, a valid BSIC is a BSIC broadcast
for that carrier in the BA(GPRS) list with a permitted NCC part (see
subclause 7.2).

An MS that has enabled PEO or EC operation shall use the 9 bit BSIC,
consisting of the NCC, the BCC and the RCC (see 3GPP TS 23.003), to
perform BSIC decoding and confirmation for the BCCH carrier of the
serving cell (see subclause 7.2.1).

In addition to what is described in subclauses 10.1.1.1 and 10.1.1.2, an
MS supporting SoLSA with SoLSA subscription shall attempt to decode BSIC
for the 6 strongest carriers, with LSA IDs to which the MS subscribes.
At least one carrier shall be searched every 5 minutes, one after
another. In the case the MS has been able to decode the BSIC, the rules
described in 10.1.3 shall be followed. The LSA IDs of the carriers are
broadcast on PBCCH of the serving cell.

#### 10.1.1.1 Packet idle mode or MAC-Idle state

Whilst in packet idle mode or MAC-Idle state an MS shall continuously
monitor all BCCH carriers as indicated by the BA(GPRS) list and the BCCH
carrier of the serving cell. At least one received signal level
measurement sample on each BCCH carrier shall be taken for each paging
block monitored by the MS according to its current DRX mode and its
paging group. As the minimum MS shall take one measurement for each BCCH
carrier for every 4 second. As the maximum, the MS is however not
required to take more than 1 sample per second for each BCCH carrier.

RLA\_P shall be a running average determined using samples collected
over a period of 5 s to
Max {5s, five consecutive paging blocks of that MS}, and shall be
maintained for each BCCH carrier. The same number of measurement samples
shall be taken for all BCCH carriers, and the samples allocated to each
carrier shall as far as possible be uniformly distributed over the
evaluation period. At least 5 received signal level measurement samples
are required for a valid RLA\_P value.

The list of the 6 strongest non‑serving carriers shall be updated at a
rate of at least once per running average period.

The MS shall attempt to check the BSIC for each of the 6 strongest
non‑serving cell BCCH carriers at least every
14 consecutive paging blocks of that MS or 10 seconds, whichever is
greater. If a change of BSIC is detected then the carrier shall be
treated as a new carrier.

In the case of a multiband MS, the MS shall attempt to decode the BSIC,
if any BCCH carrier with unknown BSIC is detected among the number of
strongest BCCH carriers in each band as indicated by the parameter
MULTIBAND\_REPORTING (see subclause 8.4.3), broadcast on PBCCH, or if
PBCCH does not exist, on BCCH.

When requested by the user, the MS shall determine which PLMNs are
available as described in subclause 6.6.1. However, for MSs without DRX
or with short DRX period (see 3GPP TS 45.002 \[22\]), considerable
interruptions to the monitoring of PPCH or PCH can not be avoided.

When PBCCH is not present in the serving cell and the network controlled
cell reselection mode (see subclause 10.1.4) is not set to NC2, the MS
shall follow the procedures specified in section 6.6.1 for the
acquisition and periodic verification of the parameters affecting cell
reselection for the non-serving cells.

#### 10.1.1.2 Packet transfer mode or MAC-Shared state

Whilst in packet transfer mode or MAC-Shared state an MS shall
continuously monitor all BCCH carriers as indicated by the BA(GPRS) list
and the BCCH carrier of the serving cell. An exception is the case of a
MS that has enabled PEO in which case the MS shall, while in packet
transfer mode, only monitor the BCCH carrier of the serving cell, as
long as it is still considered suitable, see subclause 6.6.1a. In every
TDMA frame, a received signal level measurement sample shall be taken on
at least one of the BCCH carriers, one after the other. Optionally,
measurements during up to 8 TDMA frames per PDCH multiframe may be
omitted if required for BSIC decoding or multi-RAT measurements.

RLA\_P shall be a running average determined using samples collected
over a period of 5 s, and shall be maintained for each monitored BCCH
carrier. The same number of measurement samples shall be taken for all
monitored BCCH carriers except, if the parameter PC\_MEAS\_CHAN
indicates that the power control measurements shall be made on BCCH (see
subclause 10.2.3.1.2), for the serving cell where at least 6 measurement
samples shall be taken per 52-multiframe. The samples allocated to each
carrier shall as far as possible be uniformly distributed over the
evaluation period. At least 5 received signal level measurement samples
are required for a valid RLA\_P value.

In case of a MS that has enabled EC operation, the MS shall, while in
packet transfer mode, monitor the received signal level of the serving
cell. The received signal level shall be measured as specified for RF
power control in subclause 10.2.3.1.2. The MS need not monitor received
signal level of neighbour cells, nor decode BSIC of the serving or
neighbour cells.

In some allowed multislot configurations (see 3GPP TS 45.002 \[22\]) the
MS is not able to perform normal received signal level measurements
within the TDMA frame. In this case, the MS shall perform the
measurements whenever possible according to its measurement capability
(see 3GPP TS 45.002 \[22\]). For downlink packet transfer using any
medium access mode (see 3GPP TS 44.060 \[19\]), the MS shall perform the
measurements during the block period where the polling response is sent
(T~ra~ shall apply).

NOTE 1: The network is responsible for providing the necessary
opportunities to ensure that the MS will perform the required number of
measurements.

The MS shall attempt to check the BSIC for as many non‑serving cell BCCH
carriers as possible and as often as possible, and at least every
10 seconds. A multi-RAT MS is allowed to extend this period to 13
seconds, if the neighbour cell list contains cells or frequencies from
other RATs. The MS shall use the two Idle frames of the PDCH multiframe
for this purpose. These frames are termed \"search\" frames. A list
containing BSIC and timing information for these strongest carriers at
the accuracy required for accessing a cell (see 3GPP TS 45.010 \[25\])
including the absolute times derived from the parameters T1, T2, T3
shall be kept by the MS. This information may be used to schedule the
decoding of BSIC and shall be used when re-selecting a new cell in order
to keep the switching time at a minimum. When a BCCH carrier is found to
be no longer among the reported, BSIC and timing information shall be
retained for 10 seconds. (This is in case a cell re-selection command to
this cell is received just after the MS has stopped reporting that cell,
see subclause 10.1.4.2).

In some allowed multislot configurations (see 3GPP TS 45.002 \[22\]) the
MS is not able to perform BSIC decoding or multi-RAT measurements. In
this case, except when the MS performs FCCH search or when the SCH burst
falls into the available search window, the MS may:

a\) either skip the last transmission burst in the frame immediately
preceding the idle frame;

b\) or skip the first reception burst in the frame immediately following
the idle frame;

c\) or delay the transmission of an (E)GPRS RLC/MAC block for data
transfer occurring in the radio block period whose last timeslot
allocated for such block immediately precedes the idle frame to next
available uplink radio block period and in this case the MS may not
perform transmission on that timeslot in the block period;

in order to comply to the requirement to verify and decode BSIC
information, or in order to perform multi-RAT measurements.

If, after averaging measurement results over 4 PDCH multiframes (1 sec),
the MS detects one or more BCCH carriers, among the 6 strongest, whose
BSICs are not currently being assessed, then the MS shall as a matter of
priority attempt to decode their BSICs.

In the case of a multiband MS, the MS shall attempt to decode the BSIC,
if any BCCH carrier with unknown BSIC is detected among the number of
strongest BCCH carriers in each band as indicated by the parameter
MULTIBAND\_REPORTING (see subclause 8.4.3), broadcast on PBCCH, or if
PBCCH does not exist, on BCCH.

Thus an MS shall, for a period of up to 5 seconds, devote all search
frames to attempting to decode these BSICs. If this fails then the MS
shall return to confirming existing BSICs. Having re‑confirmed existing
BSICs, if there are still BCCH carriers, among the six strongest, with
unknown BSICs, then the decoding of these shall again be given priority
for a further period of up to 5 seconds.

The MS shall be able to send the first packet random access (PRACH) at
the latest 5+x seconds after a new strongest cell (which is part of the
BA(GPRS)) has been activated under the following network conditions:
Initial serving cell at RXLEV= -70 dBm, with 6 neighbours at RXLEV= -75
dBm. Then the new BCCH carrier is switched on at RXLEV= -60 dBm. x is
the longest time it may take to receive the necessary system information
on PBCCH in the new cell.

Note: Because of test equipment limitations it is acceptable to activate
the new carrier to replace one of the 6 neighbours.

If either no BSIC can be decoded on a surrounding cell BCCH carrier, or
the BSIC is not allowed, then the received signal level measurements on
that channel shall be discarded and the MS shall continue to monitor
that channel.

If a change of BSIC is detected on a carrier, then any existing received
signal level measurement shall be discarded and the carrier shall be
treated as a new carrier.

If the BSIC cannot be decoded at the next available opportunities
re‑attempts shall be made to decode this BSIC. If the BSIC is not
decoded for more than three successive attempts it will be considered
lost and any existing received signal level measurement shall be
discarded and the MS shall continue to monitor that carrier.

When PBCCH is not present in the serving cell and the network controlled
cell reselection mode (see subclause 10.1.4) is not set to NC2, the MS
shall follow the procedures specified in section 6.6.1 for the
acquisition and periodic verification of the parameters affecting cell
reselection for the non-serving cells.

#### 10.1.1.2a Broadcast/multicast receive mode

Whilst in broadcast/multicast receive mode, an MS shall continuously
monitor all BCCH carriers as indicated by the BA(GPRS) list and the BCCH
carrier of the serving cell. In every TDMA frame, a received signal
level measurement sample shall be taken on at least one of the BCCH
carriers, one after the other. Optionally, measurements during up to 8
TDMA frames per PDCH multiframe may be omitted if required for BSIC
decoding or multi-RAT measurements. Measurements may also be omitted in
the TDMA frames where the MS is required to monitor a system information
block or a paging block. For this task, minimum performance requirements
as for packet idle mode shall apply (see subclause 10.1.1.1).

NOTE: It is expected that in all multislot configurations allowed for
MBMS (see 3GPP TS 45.002 \[22\]) the MS is able to perform normal
received signal level measurements within the TDMA frame. Hence, no
interruption of the reception is required for this purpose.

The MS shall additionally attempt to check the BSIC for non-serving cell
BCCH carriers and, in case of a multi-RAT MS, perform measurements on
neighbour cells from other RATs using the search frames. For these
tasks, performance requirements as for packet transfer mode shall apply
(see subclause 10.1.1.2 and subclause 10.1.1.3).

When the PBCCH is not present in the serving cell, the MS shall not
attempt to decode the BCCH data block that contains the parameters
affecting cell reselection as described in section 6.6.1 for non-serving
cells that have been provided by the System Information message received
from the serving cell. Instead, this information shall be provided by
the network on PACCH or on BCCH (see 3GPP TS 44.060 \[19\] and 3GPP TS
44.018 \[17\]).

#### 10.1.1.3 Monitoring cells of other radio access technologies

For a multi-RAT MS, cells or frequencies with other radio access
technologies (excluding E-UTRA) may also be included in the GPRS 3G Cell
Reselection list to be monitored (see 3GPP TS 44.060 \[19\]). This list
may be modified by Packet Measurement Order or Packet Cell Change Order
messages (see 3GPP TS 44.060 \[19\]). If cell reselection based on
ranking is used, the network controls the measurements for reselection
of those cells by the parameter Qsearch\_P optionally broadcast on PBCCH
or on BCCH if PBCCH does not exist. Qsearch\_P defines a threshold and
also indicates whether these measurements shall be performed when RLA\_P
of the serving cell is below or above the threshold.

For a multi-RAT MS supporting E-UTRA, E-UTRA frequencies may be included
in the E-UTRAN Neighbour Cell list to be monitored (see 3GPP TS 44.060
\[19\]). This list may be modified by the Packet Measurement Order
message (see 3GPP TS 44.060 \[19\]). The network controls the
measurements for reselection of E-UTRA cells by the parameter
THRESH\_priority\_search broadcast on BCCH. This parameter also controls
measurement of inter-RAT cells or frequencies included in the GPRS 3G
Cell Reselection list when the inter-RAT cell reselection algorithm
based on priority information is used (see subclause 10.1.3.3). The
mobile station shall monitor cells of inter-RAT frequencies of higher
priority than the serving cell. When RLA\_P of the serving cell is below
THRESH\_priority\_search, the mobile station shall monitor cells of
inter-RAT frequencies of lower priority than the serving cell. When
RLA\_P (see subclause 10.1.1.3) of the serving cell is above the
threshold, the mobile station is allowed not to monitor cells of
inter-RAT frequencies of lower priority than the serving cell.

For this monitoring, the MS may use search frames that are not required
for BSIC decoding or interference measurements in packet transfer mode
or MAC-Shared state. The MS may use up to 25 search frames per 13
seconds without considering the need for BSIC decoding or packet
transfer mode / MAC-Shared state interference measurements in these
frames.

Both valid cells as defined in subclause 8.4.7, and any identified cell
on a frequency for which not full identification is included in the GPRS
3G Cell Reselection list, shall be considered for re-selection.

In packet transfer mode or MAC-Shared state, a UTRAN capable MS shall be
able to send the first access at the latest 10+x seconds (in case of
cell reselection based on cell ranking) or 5+T\_reselection+x seconds
(in case of cell reselection based on priority information, if the UTRAN
frequency has lower priority than the serving cell and if RLA\_P of the
serving cell is below THRESH\_priority\_search) after a new best UTRAN
cell, which is part of the GPRS 3G Cell Reselection list, has been
activated under the condition that there is only one UTRAN frequency in
the list (and no E-UTRAN frequencies in the E-UTRAN Neighbour Cell list)
and that no new GSM cells are activated at the same time and under good
radio conditions. x is the longest time it may take to receive the
necessary system information in the new cell. As an exception, the time
is increased to 65+T\_reselection+x seconds in case of a UTRAN capable
MS performing cell reselection based on priority information (see
subclause 10.1.3.3) if the UTRAN frequency has higher priority than the
serving cell. A E-UTRAN capable MS that supports autonomous cell
reselection to E-UTRAN in packet transfer mode shall be able to send the
first access at the latest 5+T\_reselection+x seconds after a new best
E-UTRAN cell on a frequency, which is part of the E-UTRANNeighbour Cell
list, has been activated if the frequency has lower priority than the
serving cell and if RLA\_P of the serving cell is below
THRESH\_priority\_search, or within 65+T\_reselection+x seconds after it
has been activated if the frequency has higher priority than the serving
cell, under the condition that there is only one E-UTRAN frequency in
the list (and no UTRAN frequencies in the GPRS 3G Cell Reselection list)
and that no new GSM cells are activated at the same time and under good
radio conditions. For test purposes the following radio conditions can
be used: Serving GSM cell at RXLEV= -70 dBm, with 6 GSM neighbours at
RXLEV= -75 dBm. Then either an UTRAN FDD neighbour cell or an UTRAN TDD
neighbour cell or an E-UTRAN FDD neighbour cell or an E-UTRAN TDD
neighbour cell is switched on. The radio conditions for the UTRAN FDD
cell are as follows (see 3GPP TS 25.101 \[5\] for definitions):

NOTE: The parameters in the table above are valid if
THRESH\_E-UTRAN\_high\_Q and THRESH\_E-UTRAN\_low\_Q are not signalled.

The allowed access time is increased

\- by 5 seconds for each additional UTRAN frequency in the GPRS 3G Cell
Reselection list and by the time required for BSIC decoding of new
activated GSM cells when the reselection algorithm based on ranking is
used, or

\- by 5 seconds for each additional UTRAN frequency of lower priority in
the GPRS 3G Cell Reselection list when the reselection algorithm based
on priority information is used or for each additional E-UTRAN frequency
of lower priority in the E-UTRAN Neighbour Cell list and by the time
required for BSIC decoding of new activated GSM cells under the
condition that RLA\_P of the serving cell is below
THRESH\_priority\_search, or

\- by 70 seconds for each additional UTRAN frequency of higher priority
in the GPRS 3G Cell Reselection list when the reselection algorithm
based on priority information is used or for each additional E-UTRAN
frequency of higher priority in the E-UTRAN Neighbour Cell list and by
the time required for BSIC decoding of new activated GSM cells.

However, multiple UTRAN cells on the same frequency in the GPRS 3G Cell
Reselection list does not increase the allowed access time.

NOTE: The requirements above assume that only one of the frequencies in
the GPRS 3G Cell Reselection list or in the E-UTRAN Neighbour Cell list
is switched on.

In packet transfer mode or MAC-Shared state, for some allowed multislot
configurations (see 3GPP TS 45.002 \[22\]), identification of a UTRAN
TDD cell may not be guaranteed. In such cases, the MS may not be able to
fulfil the requirement above. If after 5 seconds the MS has not been
able to identify a UTRAN TDD cell, the MS is allowed to stop searching
for it in the current GSM cell.

In packet idle mode or MAC-Idle state, a UTRAN capable MS shall be able
to identify and select a new best UTRAN cell on a frequency, which is
part of the GPRS 3G Cell Reselection list, within 30 seconds (in case of
cell reselection based on cell ranking) or 25+T\_reselection seconds (in
case of cell reselection based on priority information, if the UTRAN
frequency has lower priority than the serving cell and if RLA\_P of the
serving cell is below THRESH\_priority\_search) after it has been
activated under the condition that there is only one UTRAN frequency in
the list (and no E-UTRAN frequencies in the E-UTRAN Neighbour Cell list)
and that no new GSM cells are activated at the same time and under good
radio conditions. As an exception, the time is increased to
70+T\_reselection seconds in case of a UTRAN capable MS performing cell
reselection based on priority information (see subclause 10.1.3.3) if
the UTRAN frequency has higher priority than the serving cell. A E-UTRAN
capable MS shall be able to identify and select a new best E-UTRAN cell
on a frequency, which is part of the E-UTRAN Neighbour Cell list, within
25+T\_reselection seconds after it has been activated if the frequency
has lower priority than the serving cell and if RLA\_P of the serving
cell is below THRESH\_priority\_search, or within 70+T\_reselection
seconds after it has been activated if the frequency has higher priority
than the serving cell under the condition that there is only one E-UTRAN
frequency in the list (and no UTRAN frequencies in the GPRS 3G Cell
Reselection list) and that no new GSM cells are activated at the same
time and under good radio conditions. For test purposes the same radio
conditions as for packet transfer can be used. The allowed time is
increased

\- by 30 seconds for each additional UTRAN frequency in the GPRS 3G Cell
Reselection list when the reselection algorithm based on ranking is
used, or

\- by 30 seconds for each additional UTRAN frequency of lower priority
in the GPRS 3G Cell Reselection list when the reselection algorithm
based on priority information is used or for each additional E-UTRAN
frequency of lower priority in the E-UTRAN Neighbour Cell list under the
condition that RLA\_P of the serving cell is below
THRESH\_priority\_search, or

\- by 70 seconds for each additional UTRAN frequency of higher priority
in the GPRS 3G Cell Reselection list when the reselection algorithm
based on priority information is used or for each additional E-UTRAN
frequency of higher priority in the E-UTRAN Neighbour Cell list.

However, multiple UTRAN cells on the same frequency in the GPRS 3G Cell
Reselection list does not increase the allowed time.

NOTE: The requirements above assume that only one of the frequencies in
the GPRS 3G Cell Reselection list or in the E-UTRAN Neighbour Cell list
is switched on.

A multi-RAT MS shall be able to monitor cells from other radio access
technologies, divided into (depending on the MS capability):

\- UTRAN FDD cells on up to 3 FDD frequencies, with a maximum of 32
cells per frequency; and/or\
- UTRAN TDD cells on up to 3 TDD frequencies, with a maximum of 32 cells
per frequency; and/or\
- E-UTRAN FDD cells on up to 3 FDD frequencies; and/or\
- E-UTRAN TDD cells on up to 3 TDD frequencies.

The total number of monitored UTRAN cells shall not exceed 64.

*An MS supporting E-UTRAN measurements shall be capable of monitoring a
minimum total of 7 other RAT carrier frequency layers, comprising of
any* above defined *combination of E-UTRAN FDD, E-UTRAN TDD, UTRAN FDD
and UTRAN TDD layers.*

The MS shall be capable of performing RSCP and Ec/No measurements of at
least 4 best UTRAN cells per UTRAN frequency and RSRP and RSRQ
measurements of at least 4 best E-UTRAN cells per E-UTRAN frequency,
according to its supported capabilities.

In packet idle mode or MAC-Idle state, the MS shall attempt to read and
store UTRAN predefined configurations as specified for idle mode in
subclause 6.6.4.

### 10.1.2 Cell Re-selection Criteria

The following cell re-selection criteria are used for GPRS and *Iu
mode*, whereby (s) denotes the serving cell, and (n~i~) denotes the
neighbour cells. Different parameter values may apply for each neighbour
cell. One set of parameters is broadcast in each cell.

1\) The path loss criterion parameter C1 is used as a minimum signal
level criterion for cell re-selection for GPRS and *Iu mode* in the same
way as for GSM Idle mode. C1 is the same as defined in subclause 6.4,
except that

A = RLA\_P ‑ GPRS\_RXLEV\_ACCESS\_MIN\
B = GPRS\_MS\_TXPWR\_MAX\_CCH ‑ P

The parameters GPRS\_RXLEV\_ACCESS\_MIN and GPRS\_MS\_TXPWR\_MAX\_CCH
for the serving cell and neighbour cells are broadcast on PBCCH of the
serving cell (POWER OFFSET is not used).

> While these two parameters have not been received (because the PSI3
> information element has not been decoded) default parameters shall be
> used to calculate C1.
>
> While GPRS\_RXLEV\_ACCESS\_MIN is not available, the MS shall use the
> RXLEV\_ACCESS\_MIN parameter.\
> While GPRS\_MS\_TXPWR\_MAX\_CCH is not available, the MS shall use the
> MS\_TXPWR\_MAX\_CCH parameter.
>
> All values are expressed in dBm.

2\) The signal level threshold criterion parameter C31 for hierarchical
cell structures (HCS) is used to determine whether prioritised
hierarchical GPRS and LSA cell re-selection shall apply and is defined
by:

C31(s) = RLA\_P(s) - HCS\_THR(s) (serving cell)\
C31(n) = RLA\_P(n) - HCS\_THR(n) - TO(n) \* L(n) (neighbour cell)

where HCS\_THR is the signal threshold for applying HCS GPRS and LSA
re-selection. HCS\_THR is broadcast on PBCCH of the serving cell. If
HCS\_THR(s) is not broadcast on PBCCH of the serving cell, HCS\_THR(s)
and HCS\_THR(n) shall be assumed as infinity.

3\) The cell ranking criterion parameter (C32) is used to select cells
among those with the same priority and is defined by:

C32(s) = C1(s) (serving cell)\
C32(n) = C1(n) + GPRS\_RESELECT\_OFFSET(n) - TO(n) \* (1-L(n))
(neighbour cell)\
where

GPRS\_RESELECT\_OFFSET applies an offset and hysteresis value to each
cell

TO(n) = GPRS\_TEMPORARY\_OFFSET(n) \* H(GPRS\_PENALTY\_TIME(n) - T(n)).

L(n) = 0 if PRIORITY\_CLASS(n) = PRIORITY\_CLASS(s)\
1 if PRIORITY\_CLASS(n) ≠ PRIORITY\_CLASS(s)\
In case PRIORITY\_CLASS is undefined, L(n) = 0.

H(x) = 0 for x \< 0\
1 for x ≥ 0\
GPRS\_TEMPORARY\_OFFSET applies a negative offset to C31/C32 for the
duration of GPRS\_PENALTY\_TIME after the timer T has started for that
cell. T is defined in subclause 6.4.

GPRS\_RESELECT\_OFFSET, PRIORITY\_CLASS, GPRS\_TEMPORARY\_OFFSET and
GPRS\_PENALTY\_TIME are optionally broadcast on PBCCH of the serving
cell. If GPRS\_RESELECT\_OFFSET, GPRS\_TEMPORARY\_OFFSET and
GPRS\_PENALTY\_TIME are not broadcast on PBCCH of the serving cell, the
MS shall use the default values defined in 3GPP TS 44.060 \[19\].

### 10.1.3 Cell Re-selection Algorithm

At least for every new sample or every second, whichever is the
greatest, the MS shall update RLA\_P and calculate the value of C1, C31
and C32 for the serving cell and the non‑serving cells. The MS shall
make a cell re-selection if:

i\) The path loss criterion parameter (C1) for the serving cell falls
below zero.

ii\) A non‑serving suitable cell (see 3GPP TS 43.022 \[11\]) is
evaluated to be better than the serving cell. The best cell is the cell
with the highest value of C32 among

\- those cells that have the highest PRIORITY\_CLASS among those cells
that have highest LSA priority among those that fulfil the criterion C31
≥ 0, or

\- all cells, if no cells fulfil the criterion C31 ≥ 0.

If the parameter C32\_QUAL is set, positive GPRS\_RESELECT\_OFFSET
values shall only be applied to the neighbour cell with the highest
RLA\_P value of those cells for which C32 is compared above.

LSA priority is defined by the list of LSAs for the subscriber stored on
the SIM (see 3GPP TS 51.011 \[34\]). LSAs are identified by LSA ID(s)
broadcast on PBCCH of the serving cell. Cells not belonging to this list
are given LSA priority lower than 0. The LSA priority shall be
considered only by an MS supporting SoLSA.

PRIORITY\_CLASS and C32\_QUAL are broadcast on PBCCH of the serving
cell.

When evaluating the best cell, the following hysteresis values shall be
subtracted from the C32 value for the neighbour cells:

\- in GMM Standby state (*A/Gb mode*) or RRC-Idle mode or RRC-GRA\_PCH
state (*Iu mode*), if the new cell is in the same routing area: 0.

\- in GMM Ready state (*A/Gb mode*) or RRC-Cell\_Shared state (*Iu
mode*), if the new cell is in the same routing area:\
GPRS\_CELL\_RESELECT\_HYSTERESIS. If the parameter C31\_HYST is set,
GPRS\_CELL\_RESELECT\_HYSTERESIS shall also be subtracted from the C31
value for the neighbour cells.

\- in GMM Standby or GMM Ready state (*A/Gb mode*) or RRC-Idle or
RRC\_Connected mode (*Iu mode*), if the new cell is in a different
routing area:\
RA\_RESELECT\_HYSTERESIS.

\- in case of a cell re-selection occurred within the previous 15
seconds: 5 dB.

GPRS\_CELL\_RESELECT\_HYSTERESIS, C31\_HYST and RA\_RESELECT\_HYSTERESIS
are broadcast on PBCCH of the serving cell.

Cell re-selection for any other reason (see 3GPP TS 43.022 \[11\]) shall
take place immediately, but the cell that the MS was camped on shall not
be returned to within 5 seconds if another suitable cell can be found.
If valid RLA\_P values are not available, the MS shall wait until these
values are available and then perform the cell re-selection if it is
still required. The MS may accelerate the measurement procedure within
the requirements in subclause 10.1.1 to minimise the cell re-selection
delay.

If no suitable cell is found within 10 seconds, the cell
selection algorithm of 3GPP TS 43.022 \[11\] shall be performed. Since
information concerning a number of channels is already known to the MS,
it may assign high priority to measurements on the strongest carriers
from which it has not previously made attempts to obtain BCCH
information, and omit repeated measurements on the known ones.

While in broadcast/multicast receive mode, the MS shall apply the rules
defined above for the GMM Ready state.

#### 10.1.3.1 Abnormal cell reselection

In the event of an abnormal release with cell reselection (see 3GPP TS
44.060 \[19\]) the MS shall determine which cell to be used for this
cell reselection attempt according to the following rules.

Within the allowed time, the MS shall attempt abnormal cell reselection
on a suitable cell using one of the following two criteria:

a\) The MS shall try cells based on BA(GPRS), in the order of C2,
starting from the cell with the highest C2 value according to section
6.6.2 item ii sub-item a, excluding the timing requirement of 5 seconds.

b\) The MS shall try cells based on BA(GPRS), in the order of C32,
starting from the cell with the highest C32 value according to section
10.1.3 item ii.

The criteria, a) or b), to be used shall be determined by which cell
reselection algorithm is currently in use according to section 10.1.

The MS is under no circumstances allowed to access a cell to attempt
abnormal cell reselection later than 20 seconds after the
detection within the MS of the abnormal release causing the abnormal
cell reselection attempt. In the case where the 20 seconds elapses
without a successful abnormal cell reselection the attempt shall be
abandoned, and normal cell reselection shall be performed.

In case the MS is operating in NC2 mode, abnormal cell reselection shall
override the NC2 mode and the MS shall perform the algorithm as
described in this section.

#### 10.1.3.2 Algorithm for cell re-selection from GSM to UTRAN based on cell ranking

The algorithm in this subclause shall be used for reselection from GSM
to UTRAN if the conditions for the use of the cell reselection algorithm
based on priority information (see subclause 10.1.3.3) are not
satisfied.

If the GPRS 3G Cell Reselection list includes UTRAN frequencies, the MS
shall, at least every 5 second update the value RLA\_P for the serving
cell and each of the at least 6 strongest non serving GSM cells.

The MS shall then reselect a suitable (see TS 25.304 \[8\]) UTRAN cell
if:

\- for a TDD cell the measured RSCP value is equal to or greater than
TDD\_GPRS\_Qoffset for a period of 5 s and

\- for an FDD cell the following criteria are all met for a period of 5
s:

1\) its measured RSCP value exceeds the value of RLA\_P for the serving
cell and all of the suitable (see 3GPP TS 43.022 \[11\]) non-serving GSM
cells by the value FDD\_GPRS\_Qoffset,

2\) its measured Ec/No value is equal or greater than the value
FDD\_Qmin - FDD\_Qmin\_Offset, and

3\) its measured RSCP value is equal to or greater than
FDD\_RSCP\_threshold.

In case of a cell reselection occurring within the previous 15 seconds,
FDD\_GPRS\_Qoffset or TDD\_GPRS\_Qoffset is increased by 5 dB.

Where

\- Ec/No and RSCP are the measured quantities, se subclause 8.1.5.

\- FDD\_RSCP\_threshold equals FDD\_RSCPmin -- min((P\_MAX -- 21 dBm), 3
dB) if FDD\_RSCPmin is broadcast on the serving cell, else
Qrxlevmin + Pcompensation + 10 dB, if these parameters are available,
otherwise the default value of FDD\_RSCPmin.

\- Qrxlevmin is the minimum required RX level in the UTRAN FDD cell
(dBm), see 3GPP TS 25.304 \[8\].

\- Pcompensation is max(UE\_TXPWR\_MAX\_RACH -- P\_MAX, 0) (dB), see
3GPP TS 25.304 \[8\].

\- UE\_TXPWR\_MAX\_RACH is the maximum TX power level an MS may use when
accessing the UTRAN FDD cell on RACH (dBm), see 3GPP TS 25.304 \[8\].

\- P\_MAX is the maximum RF output power of the MS (dBm) in UTRAN FDD
mode, see 3GPP TS 25.304 \[8\].

\- FDD\_Qmin, FDD\_GPRS\_Qoffset and optionally FDD\_RSCPmin and
FDD\_Qmin\_Offset are broadcast on PBCCH of the serving cell.

\- TDD\_GPRS\_Qoffset is broadcast on PBCCH of the serving cell.

NOTE 1: The parameters required to determine if the UTRAN cell is
suitable are broadcast on BCCH of the UTRAN cell. An MS may start
reselection towards the UTRAN cell before decoding the BCCH of the UTRAN
cell, leading to a short interruption of service if the UTRAN cell is
not suitable.

NOTE 2: If FDD\_RSCPmin is broadcast, optimum GSM to UTRAN reselection
performance is achieved if UTRAN cells at UTRAN coverage border areas
are planned for +24 dBm UE power.

NOTE 3: The parameter TDD\_Qoffset is an absolute threshold for
reselection towards a target UTRAN TDD cell.

The MS shall store the UTRAN cell RSCP suitability criterion parameters
above, whenever decoded from a UTRAN FDD cell of an equivalent PLMN
while attempting to camp on the UTRAN FDD cell. The most recently
decoded parameters from one UTRAN FDD cell of an equivalent PLMN are
valid reselection criteria towards all UTRAN FDD cells. This list of
parameters shall be cleared after PLMN selection (see 3GPP TS 23.122
\[4\]).

Cell reselection to UTRAN shall not occur within 5 seconds after the MS
has reselected a GSM cell from an UTRAN cell if a suitable GSM cell can
be found.

In case of a reselection attempt towards a barred UTRAN cell, the MS
shall abandon further reselection attempts towards this UTRAN cell as
defined by the T~barred~ value on the barred UTRAN cell (see 3GPP TS
25.331 \[9\]).

In case the highest ranked UTRAN cell is not suitable (see 3GPP TS
25.304 \[8\]) due to being part of the \"list of forbidden LAs for
roaming\" or belonging to a PLMN which is not indicated as being
equivalent to the registered PLMN, the MS may abandon further
reselection attempts towards this UTRAN cell and all other cells on the
same frequency, for a period of up to 20 min. If the MS has to perform
cell selection, this limitation shall be removed. If the MS is
redirected under GERAN control to a frequency for which the timer is
running, any limitation on that frequency shall be removed.

If more than one UTRAN cell fulfils the above criteria, the MS shall
select the cell with the greatest RSCP value.

#### 10.1.3.3 Algorithm for inter-RAT cell re-selection based on priority information

This algorithm and its applicability are as specified in sub-clause
6.6.6.

#### 10.1.3.4 Cell selection and re-selection to CSG cells and hybrid cells

If a mobile station is a member of at least one Closed Subscriber Group,
i.e. at least one CSG ID and its PLMN ID is included in the MS's CSG
Whitelist**, then,** in addition to normal cell reselection, the MS
shall use an autonomous search function to detect UTRAN and/or E-UTRAN
CSG cells and hybrid cells. The autonomous search function shall at
least detect previously visited allowed CSG cells and previously visited
hybrid cells whose CSG IDs are included in the CSG Whitelist of the MS.

NOTE: The MS does not perform autonomous cell reselection to CSG cells
in packet transfer mode if NC2 mode is configured.

Measurement of CSG cells and cell re-selection to CSG cells in packet
idle mode and in packet transfer mode shall follow the same rules as in
subclause 6.6.7.1 (the performance requirements for the autonomous
search and cell re-selection to a previously visited allowed CSG cell
shall not apply in packet transfer mode). Cell re-selection to cells
detected as hybrid cells in packet idle mode and in packet transfer mode
shall follow the rules in subclause 6.6.7.1a (the performance
requirements for the autonomous search and cell re-selection to a
previously visited hybrid cell, whose CSG ID is included in the CSG
Whitelist of the MS, shall not apply in packet transfer mode). Manual
search and selection of CSG ID(s) in packet idle mode shall follow the
same rules as in subclause 6.6.7.2.

The MS is not required to perform manual search and selection of CSG
ID(s) while in packet transfer mode.

### 10.1.4 Network controlled Cell re-selection

The network may request measurement reports from the MS and control its
cell re‑selection. This is indicated by the parameter
NETWORK\_CONTROL\_ORDER. The meaning of the different parameter values
is specified as follows:

NC0 Normal MS control\
The MS shall perform autonomous cell re-selection.

NC1 MS control with measurement reports\
The MS shall send measurement reports to the network as defined in
subclause 10.1.4.1.\
The MS shall perform autonomous cell re-selection.

NC2 Network control\
The MS shall send measurement reports to the network as defined in
subclause 10.1.4.1.\
The MS shall only perform autonomous cell re-selection when the
reselection is triggered by a downlink signalling failure as defined in
subclause 6.5 or a random access failure as defined in 3GPP TS 44.018
and 3GPP TS 44.060 or if the cell is barred or the C1 criterion falls
below zero. The MS shall only determine whether the cell is barred once
camped on the cell.

RESET The MS shall return to the broadcast parameters. Only sent on
PCCCH or PACCH.

An exception is the case of a MS that has enabled PEO or EC operation in
which case the MS shall only use NC0.

The parameter values NC1 and NC2 only apply in GMM Ready state (*A/Gb
mode*) or RRC-Cell\_Shared state (*Iu mode*). In GMM Standby state
(*A/Gb mode*) or RRC-Idle mode or RRC-GRA\_PCH state (*Iu mode)*, the MS
shall always use normal MS control independent of the ordered NC mode.

While in broadcast/multicast receive mode, the MS shall operate in
Network Control mode NC0 even if it had been ordered otherwise by the
network. If in GMM Ready state, the mobile station shall move to NC0
upon entering broadcast/multicast receive mode. When returning to packet
idle mode, the mobile station shall revert to the control mode ordered
by the network before entering broadcast/multicast receive mode if the
mobile station is still in GMM Ready state. If leaving
broadcast/multicast receive mode to enter packet transfer mode, the MS
shall apply the network control mode commanded by the network in the
system information.

A set of measurement reporting parameters (NETWORK\_CONTROL\_ORDER,
NC\_REPORTING\_PERIOD(s) and optionally REPORT\_TYPE,
MULTIBAND\_REPORTING, SERVING\_BAND\_REPORTING,
XXX\_MULTIRAT\_REPORTING, XXX\_REPORTING\_OFFSET,
XXX\_REPORTING\_THRESHOLD, FDD\_REPORTING\_THRESHOLD\_2, REP\_PRIORITY,
REPORTING\_RATE, INVALID\_BSIC\_REPORTING, SCALE\_ORD, FDD\_REP\_QUANT,
Qsearch\_P, E-UTRAN\_REP\_QUANT, E-UTRAN\_FDD\_REPORTING\_THRESHOLD\_2,
E-UTRAN\_TDD\_REPORTING\_THRESHOLD\_2,
E-UTRAN\_FDD\_MEASUREMENT\_REPORT\_OFFSET,
E-UTRAN\_TDD\_MEASUREMENT\_REPORT\_OFFSET, Qsearch\_P\_E-UTRAN,
UTRAN\_CSG\_XXX\_REPORTING\_THRESHOLD,
UTRAN\_CSG\_FDD\_REPORTING\_THRESHOLD\_2 ,
E-UTRAN\_CSG\_XXX\_REPORTING\_THRESHOLD,
E-UTRAN\_CSG\_XXX\_REPORTING\_THRESHOLD\_2) is broadcast on BCCH and,
excepting E-UTRAN parameters, on PBCCH if it exists. XXX indicates, as
applicable, GSM frequency band (e.g. 900, 850, etc) or other radio
access technology/mode (e.g. FDD, TDD, E-UTRAN, E-UTRAN FDD, E-UTRAN
TDD). This set of parameters may also be sent individually to an MS on
PACCH or, excepting E-UTRAN parameters, on PCCCH in :

> \- a PACKET MEASUREMENT ORDER message, in which case it overrides the
> NC parameters broadcast in the serving cell. These individual
> parameters are only valid in the serving cell.
>
> \- a PACKET CELL CHANGE ORDER message, in which case it overrides the
> NC parameters broadcast in the target cell. These individual
> parameters are only valid in the target cell.

The individual parameters are valid until the RESET command is sent to
the MS or there is a downlink signalling failure or a random access
failure or if the cell is barred or the C1 criterion falls below zero or
the MS goes to the GMM Standby state (*A/Gb mode*) or RRC-Idle mode or
RRC-GRA\_PCH state (*Iu mode*) or MS enters dedicated mode or dual
transfer mode (*A/Gb mode*) or RRC-Cell\_Dedicated state (*Iu mode*).
Before the MS has acquired NC parameters when entering a new cell, the
MS shall assume mode NC0 unless NC0, NC1 or NC2 mode was explicitly
commanded by a PACKET CELL CHANGE ORDER message in the previous cell.

A parameter NC\_FREQUENCY\_LIST may also be sent individually to an MS
on PCCCH or PACCH. This list adds/deletes frequencies to the BA(GPRS)
both for cell re-selection and for measurement reports. The
NC\_FREQUENCY\_LIST and the REP\_PRIORITY are valid until an empty
NC\_FREQUENCY\_LIST is sent to the MS, there is a downlink signalling
failure or the MS selects a new cell or the BA(GPRS) that is modified by
the NC\_FREQUENCY\_LIST changes or MS enters dedicated mode (*A/Gb
mode*) or RRC-Cell\_Dedicated state (*Iu mode*).

The same considerations regarding validity apply to lists that include
cells with other radio access technologies.

A list given by Packet Cell Change Order applies in the new cell. This
list may also include cells with other radio access technologies.

If the MS operates in NC1 or NC2 modes, the network may control UTRAN
measurements per individual UTRAN frequency by the parameters
Measurement\_Control\_UTRAN and E-UTRAN measurements per individual
E‑UTRAN frequency by the parameters Measurement\_Control\_E-UTRAN. In
NC1 mode, cell reselection requirements shall have priority over
reporting requirements. An MS operating in NC1 mode is not required to
report a cell if the MS is not monitoring that cell for the purpose of
cell reselection.

All signalling for support of network controlled cell re-selection and
measurement reports are defined in 3GPP TS 44.060 \[19\].

#### 10.1.4.1 Measurement reporting

When ordered to send measurement reports, the MS shall continuously
monitor all carriers in BA(GPRS) or as indicated by the parameter
NC\_FREQUENCY\_LIST and the BCCH carrier of the serving cell. The
measurement requirements are defined in subclause 10.1.1 for the actual
packet mode.

For each carrier, the measured received signal level (RXLEV) shall be
the average of the received signal level measurement samples in dBm
taken on that carrier within the reporting period. The reporting period
is defined as follows:

\- in packet idle mode or MAC-Idle state, the reporting period is
NC\_REPORTING\_PERIOD\_I rounded off to the nearest smaller integer
multiple of DRX period if NC\_REPORTING PERIOD\_I is greater than DRX
period, else, the reporting period is DRX period;

\- in packet transfer mode or MAC-Shared state, the reporting period is
indicated in NC\_REPORTING\_PERIOD\_T.

In averaging, measurements made during previous reporting periods shall
always be discarded. The start of the first reporting period may be
random.

After each reporting period, the MS shall send a measurement report to
BSS (see 3GPP TS 44.060 \[19\]). The MS shall then discard any previous
measurement report, which it has not been able to send. Provided that
the MS has received BSIC for all GSM neighbour cells, the parameter
REPORT\_TYPE indicates if the MS shall use Packet Measurement Report
(normal reporting) or Packet Enhanced Measurement Report (enhanced
reporting) (see 3GPP TS 44.060 \[19\]). The measurement report shall
contain:

\- RXLEV for the serving cell;

\- received signal level for the non-serving cells:

\- If the requirements for reporting a CSG cell are met, the MS shall
follow the requirements specified in sub-clause 8.4.9 for the reporting
of a CSG cell. Requirements in sub-clause 8.4.9 take precedence over the
requirements in the following bullets.

\- For normal measurement reporting, carriers shall be reported if they
are among the 6 strongest carriers and BSIC is successfully decoded and
allowed (see subclause 10.1.1), i.e. either equal to the BSIC of the
list or with allowed NCC part of BSIC. In the latter case, which applies
for BA(BCCH) where no BSIC is given, the decoded BSIC shall be included
in the report. For an MS supporting network sharing, the cells with BSIC
equal to the BSIC of the list shall also have a permitted NCC part (see
clause 7.2). If the mobile station has acquired the GSM Neighbour Cell
list (see 3GPP TS 44.060 \[19\]), only cells present in that list shall
be included in the report. In the case of a multiband MS, the MS shall
report the number of strongest BCCH carriers in each band as indicated
by the parameter MULTIBAND\_REPORTING (see subclause 8.4.3), broadcast
on PBCCH, or if PBCCH does not exist, on BCCH. For multi-RAT MS, the MS
shall report the number of best valid cells in each other radio access
technology/mode as indicated by the parameters XXX\_MULTIRAT\_REPORTING,
see subclause 8.4.7. In this case, the received signal level is replaced
by the relevant measurement quantity (see subclause 8.1.5). Valid cells
are defined in subclause 8.4.7;

\- For Enhanced Measurement Reporting, cells shall be reported if they
are among the at least 6 strongest carriers, and BSIC is successfully
decoded and valid (see subclause 10.1.1) or, if indicated by the
parameter INVALID\_BSIC\_REPORTING, with known and allowed NCC part. For
an MS supporting network sharing, a valid BSIC is a BSIC of the list
with a permitted NCC part. The neighbour cells shall be reported
according to the priority defined in subclause 8.4.8.1. For other radio
access technology/mode, RXLEV is replaced by the relevant measurement
quantity (see subclause 8.1.5);

\- BSIC\_SEEN (only for Enhanced Measurement Reporting).\
Indicates if a GSM cell with invalid BSIC and allowed NCC part of the
BSIC is one of the six strongest cells.

In the case of Packet Transfer mode or MAC-Shared state with the
NC\_REPORTING\_PERIOD\_T = 0.48 s the MS shall report a new strongest
GSM cell in the measurement report at the latest 5 s after a new
strongest cell (which is part of the BA(GPRS)) has been activated under
the following network conditions: Initial serving cell at RXLEV= -70
dBm, with 6 neighbours at RXLEV= -75 dBm. Then the new BCCH carrier is
switched on at RXLEV= -60 dBm.

NOTE: Because of test equipment limitations it is acceptable to activate
the new carrier to replace one of the 6 neighbours.

A UTRAN capable MS shall report a new best UTRAN cell, which is part of
the neighbour cell list, at the latest 5 seconds after it has been
activated under the condition that there is only one UTRAN frequency in
the neighbour cell list (and no E-UTRAN frequencies in the neighbour
cell list) and that no new GSM cells are activated at the same time and
under good radio conditions. A E-UTRAN capable MS that supports
measurement reporting of E-UTRAN cells shall report a new best E-UTRAN
cell, on a frequency contained in the E-UTRAN Neighbour Cell list, at
the latest 5 seconds after it has been activated under the condition
that there is only one E-UTRAN frequency in theE-UTRAN Neighbour Cell
list (and no UTRAN frequencies in the 3G Neighbour Cell list) and that
no new GSM cells are activated at the same time and under good radio
conditions. For test purposes the following radio conditions can be
used:

Serving GSM cell at RXLEV= -70 dBm, with 6 GSM neighbours at RXLEV= -75
dBm. Then either an UTRAN FDD neighbour cell or an UTRAN TDD neighbour
cell or an E-UTRAN FDD neighbour cell or an E-UTRAN TDD neighbour cell
is switched on. The radio conditions for the UTRAN FDD cells are as
follows (see 3GPP TS 25.101 \[5\] for definitions):

  NOTE 1: OCNG shall be used such that the E-UTRAN cell is fully allocated and a constant total transmitted power spectral density is achieved for all OFDM symbols.                                          
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------- ----------------------

The allowed reporting time is increased by 5 seconds for each additional
UTRAN frequency in the neighbour cell list or for each additional
E-UTRAN frequency in the neighbour cell list and by the time required
for BSIC decoding of new activated GSM cells. However, multiple UTRAN
cells on the same frequency in the neighbour cell list does not increase
the allowed reporting time.

NOTE: The requirements above assume that only one UTRAN or E-UTRAN
frequency is switched on.

In case a cell is abandoned for cell reselection attempts due to being
part of the \"list of forbidden LAs for roaming\" (for UTRAN cells) or
part of the \"list of forbidden TAs for roaming\" (for E-UTRAN cells),
or belonging to a PLMN which is not indicated as being equivalent to the
registered PLMN, as defined in subclause 10.1.3.2 and in subclause
10.1.3.3, the MS may abandon monitoring and reporting this UTRAN or
E-UTRAN cell and all other cells on the same frequency for the same
period of time that reselection attempts are abandoned. If the MS has
received the PCID to TA Mapping information element for the E-UTRAN
frequency of the cell (see 3GPP TS 44.060 \[19\]), the MS may abandon,
for the same period of time that reselection attempts are abandoned,
monitoring and reporting this E-UTRAN cell and any E-UTRAN cell which
known to belong to the same Tracking Area.

NOTE: Monitoring and reporting of E-UTRAN cells whose PCID does not
belong to the PCID group associated with the forbidden Tracking Area is
not affected.

In packet transfer mode or MAC-Shared state, for some allowed multislot
configurations (see 3GPP TS 45.002 \[22\]), identification of a UTRAN
TDD cell may not be guaranteed. In such cases, the MS may not be able to
fulfil the requirement above. If after 5 seconds the MS has not been
able to identify a UTRAN TDD cell, the MS is allowed to stop searching
for it in the current GSM cell.

In packet transfer mode, a multi-RAT MS with no or an empty CSG
Whitelist is not required to measure, and shall not report, cells known
to be CSG cells; a multi-RAT MS indicating support of neither \"UTRA CSG
Cells Reporting\" nor \"E-UTRA CSG Cells Reporting\" in the *MS Radio
Access Capability* IE (see 3GPP TS 24.008 \[46\]) shall not report cells
known to be CSG cells other than as part of a cell change notification
procedure (see 3GPP TS 44.060 \[19\]) when the target cell is a CSG
cell.

#### 10.1.4.2 Cell re-selection command

A cell re-selection command may be sent from the network to an MS. When
the MS receives the command, it shall re-select the cell according to
the included cell description and change the network control mode
according to the command (see 3GPP TS 44.060 \[19\]). An exception is
the case of a MS that has enabled PEO or EC operation in which case only
autonomous cell reselection is used by the MS. The command may include
re-selection of another radio access technology/mode.

If an MS receives a cell re-selection command towards a GSM cell to
which it is not synchronised, the MS shall indicate a packet cell change
failure (see 3GPP TS 44.060 \[19\]).

If a UTRAN capable MS receives a cell re-selection command towards a not
known UTRAN cell (see 3GPP TS 25.133 \[7\] and 3GPP TS 25.123 \[6\]), or
if a E-UTRAN capable MS receives a cell re-selection command towards a
not known E-UTRAN cell (see 3GPP TS 36.133 \[39\]), then the MS shall
search for synchronisation information up to 800 ms. In case of failure,
the MS shall return to the old cell and indicate a packet cell change
failure (see 3GPP TS 44.060 \[19\]).

#### 10.1.4.3 Exceptional cases

An MS in network control mode NC1 or NC2 may enter an exceptional case
if a circuit switched connection is established, which takes precedence
over GPRS cell re-selection. This includes an MS operating in DTM.

In such a case the MS is not required to send measurement reports
according to subclause 10.1.4.1, and shall not obey any cell
re-selection command.

Whenever the exceptional case ends, the MS shall resume the GPRS mode
tasks as specified in sub-clause 10.

10.1a Measurement and Reporting of CSG Cells and hybrid cells
-------------------------------------------------------------

If a mobile station supports \"UTRA (respectively E-UTRA) CSG Cells
Reporting\", it shall support MIB/SIB reading and reporting in packet
transfer mode. The MS may acquire routing parameters and the CSG ID for
a UTRAN (respectively E-UTRAN) CSG cell by reading MIB and SIB3
(respectively MIB and SIB1) of that cell. The MS is allowed to
autonomously skip idle frames or TDMA frames on PDCH to read MIB and SIB
and only skips the timeslot(s) or TDMA frame(s) during which either MIB
or SIB is transmitted.

A multi RAT mobile station **which indicates** support of \"UTRA CSG
Cells Reporting\" (respectively \"E-UTRA CSG Cells Reporting\") in the
*MS Radio Access Capability* IE (see 3GPP TS 24.008) **shall report CSG
cells and hybrid cells in packet transfer mode according to the
procedures in sub-clause 8.4.9 if:**

\- the cell is the strongest of any cell on the same frequency (see 3GPP
TS 25.304 and 3GPP TS 36.304 for the definition of the strongest cell);
and

\- (for UTRAN FDD CSG cells) the reported value (CPICH Ec/No) is equal
to or higher than UTRAN\_CSG\_FDD\_REPORTING\_THRESHOLD and the
non-reported value (CPICH RSCP) is equal to or higher than
UTRAN\_CSG\_FDD\_REPORTING\_THRESHOLD\_2; and

\- (for UTRAN TDD CSG cells) the reported value (P-CCPCH RSCP) is equal
to or higher than UTRAN\_CSG\_TDD\_REPORTING\_THRESHOLD; and

\- (for E-UTRAN FDD CSG cells) the reported value (RSRQ) is equal to or
higher than E-UTRAN\_CSG\_FDD\_REPORTING\_THRESHOLD and the non-reported
value (RSRP) is equal to or higher than
E-UTRAN\_CSG\_FDD\_REPORTING\_THRESHOLD\_2; and

\- (for E-UTRAN TDD CSG cells) the reported value (RSRQ) is equal to or
higher than E-UTRAN\_CSG\_TDD\_REPORTING\_THRESHOLD and the non-reported
value (RSRP) is equal to or higher than
E-UTRAN\_CSG\_TDD\_REPORTING\_THRESHOLD\_2; and

\- the conditions specified in 3GPP TS 44.060 are met.

The parameters Qsearch\_P and Measurement\_Control\_UTRAN are not
applicable to UTRAN CSG cells. The parameters Qsearch\_P\_E-UTRAN and
Measurement\_Control\_E-UTRAN are not applicable to E-UTRAN CSG cells.

If information about dedicated CSG frequencies is available to the MS,
the MS may restrict the measurement of CSG cells only on these dedicated
frequencies and on the other frequencies listed in the system
information.

10.2 RF Power Control
---------------------

Sub-clauses 10.2.1 and 10.2.2 do not apply for the PDCH/H in Exclusive
MAC mode while in DTM. In this case:

\- The MS shall apply the output power ordered by the network on the
SACCH to all channels (both for the TCH/H and the PDCH/H).

\- The network shall use the same output power on the dedicated
connection and on all the blocks on the PDCH/H addressed to the MS.
Blocks not addressed to the MS may be transmitted at a lower power
level. As an exception, the bursts transmitted on the BCCH carrier shall
be transmitted at the BCCH level.

NOTE: Power control is not applicable to point-to-multipoint services if
transmission is without ARQ (see 3GPP TS 44.060).

### 10.2.1 MS output power

The RF output power, P~CH~ , to be employed by the MS on each individual
uplink PDCH shall be:

P~CH~ = min(Γ~0~ - Γ~CH~ - α \* (C + 48), PMAX), (1)

where

> Γ~CH~ is an MS and channel specific power control parameter, sent to
> the MS in an RLC control message (see 3GPP TS 44.060). For those
> uplink PDCHs, for which Γ~CH~ has not been defined, value 0 shall be
> used.
>
> Γ~0~ = 39 dBm for GSM 400, GSM 700, GSM 850, ER-GSM 900 and GSM900\
> = 36 dBm for DCS1 800 and PCS 1900
>
> α is a system parameter, broadcast on PBCCH or optionally sent to MS
> in an RLC control message (see 3GPP TS 44.018 and 3GPP TS 44.060). In
> case of EC operation, α is given by the ALPHA parameter broadcast in
> EC SI 2 (see 3GPP TS 44.018 \[17\]) and the ALPHA\_Enable parameter
> given in assignment messages (see 3GPP TS 44.018 \[17\] and 3GPP TS
> 44.060 \[19\]). If ALPHA\_Enable equals 1, the broadcast ALPHA shall
> be used. If ALPHA\_Enable equals 0, α shall be set to 0.
>
> C is the normalised received signal level at the MS as defined in
> 10.2.3.1.
>
> PMAX is the maximum allowed output power in the cell.
>
> For DCS 1800 and PCS 1900, PMAX =\
> GPRS\_MS\_TXPWR\_MAX\_CCH if present,\
> MS\_TXPWR\_MAX\_CCH otherwise:
>
> For all other bands, PMAX =
>
> LB\_MS\_TXPWR\_MAX\_CCH + Band\_offset, if LB\_MS\_TXPWR\_MAX\_CCH is
> present, otherwise GPRS\_MS\_TXPWR\_MAX\_CCH if present, otherwise
> MS\_TXPWR\_MAX\_CCH;
>
> where Band\_offset equals:
>
> 0 dB for GSM 850, ER-GSM 900 and GSM 900,
>
> -2 dB for GSM 700,
>
> -6 dB for GSM 400.

All power values are expressed in dBm.

When the MS receives new Γ~CH~ or α values, the MS shall use the new
value to update P~CH~ according to equation (1) 2 radio blocks after the
end of the frame containing the last timeslot of the message block
containing the new value, which ensures 2 blocks time for processing
even in case of timeslot reconfiguration.

The MS may round the calculated output power to the nearest nominal
output power value (see 3GPP TS 45.005) although a higher resolution is
preferred. The output power actually transmitted by the MS shall fulfil
the absolute accuracy as specified in 45.005. In addition, the
transmitted power shall be a monotonic function of the calculated output
power and any change of 2 dB in the calculated value shall correspond to
a change of 2 ± 1.5 dB in the transmitted value.

The MS shall use the same output power on all four bursts within one
radio block. An EC-GSM-IoT capable MS transmitting blind physical layer
transmissions shall use the same output power on all transmissions
within one fixed uplink allocation.

When accessing a cell on the PRACH or RACH (random access) or on the
PACCH when sending the PS Handover Access message, the MS shall use the
output power defined by min{PMAX, PRED}, where PRED is the power defined
in subclause 4.2. If INIT\_PWR\_RED is not broadcast, the MS shall use
the output power defined by PMAX for all random access attempts.

MS\_TXPWR\_MAX\_CCH is broadcast on the BCCH of the cell. A class 3
DCS1 800 MS shall add to it the value POWER OFFSET broadcast on the
BCCH.

GPRS\_MS\_TXPWR\_MAX\_CCH is broadcast on PBCCH or CPBCCH of the serving
cell and in case of DTM, sent on SACCH and optionally on main DCCH.

LB\_MS\_TXPWR\_MAX\_CCH is optionally broadcast on BCCH of the serving
cell, and on PBCCH, PCCCH and PACCH if PBCCH is present.

INIT\_PWR\_RED is broadcast on the BCCH of the cell. After a cell
re-selection, within GERAN, if access is needed before INIT\_PWR\_RED
has been acquired from the serving cell, the value in the previous cell
shall be applied.

If the MS accesses a cell on the PRACH before receiving
GPRS\_MS\_TXPWR\_MAX\_CCH on PBCCH and if LB\_MS\_TXPWR\_MAX\_CCH is not
broadcast, the MS shall determine PMAX using MS\_TXPWR\_MAX\_CCH as
default.

If a calculated output power is not supported by the MS, the MS shall
use the supported output power which is closest to the calculated output
power.

In case of DTM, if a valid C value does not exist, the MS may transmit
on each uplink PDCH with the output power signalled in the L1 header of
the main SACCH, until a valid C value exists.

The value of Γ~CH~ shall be the same for both PDCHs constituting an
uplink PDCH-pair in RTTI configuration (see 3GPP TS 44.060).

The MS may calculate the C value in dedicated mode.

### 10.2.2 BTS output power

Downlink power control can only be used when the serving BCCH or CPBCCH
and the used PDCH frequencies are in the same frequency band.

On the PDCHs that contain PBCCH or PCCCH, the BTS shall use constant
output power, which may be lower than the output power used on BCCH. The
power reduction (Pb) used on PCCCH, relative to the output power used on
BCCH, is broadcast on PBCCH. For COMPACT, on the blocks that contain
CPBCCH, CPCCCH, CFCCH, or CSCH, the BTS shall use constant output power.

On PTCCH/D, the BTS shall use the same output power as for PBCCH, or
BCCH if PBCCH does not exist. As an exception to this, the output power
for some of the PTCCH/D blocks may be lower in some cases (e.g. with
adaptive antennas), but with no requirements for the MS to decode them.
The network is however responsible to provide each MS with required TA
information.

On other PDCH radio blocks, downlink power control may be used. The BTS
shall use the same output power on all four bursts within one radio
block except for bursts transmitted on the BCCH carrier. Thus, a
procedure may be implemented in the network to control the output power
of the downlink transmission based on the Channel Quality Reports.

On PDCHs that do not contain PBCCH or PCCCH and do not use downlink
power control (as indicated in the assignment message), the BTS shall
use a constant output power with the exception that it is not required
to transmit on every block. If the output power used on the transmitted
blocks is not equal to (BCCH level -- Pb) then the MS is not required to
fulfil 3GPP TS 45.005 requirements for the first 25 blocks addressed to
this MS.

In case of downlink power control, parameter P0 is used: P0 is defined
as a power reduction relative to BCCH or CPBCCH and is included in the
assignment message. The value of P0 is not allowed to change during
Packet Transfer Mode or MAC-Shared state except in the case a
reassignment or a new assignment is established not including any of the
previously assigned PDCH(s). A MS shall only have one P0 value at a
time.

On each PDTCH/D block, the PR field of the MAC header, if present and if
downlink power control is used, shall indicate the output power level
used to send this block (see 3GPP TS 44.060). There shall be two PR
management cases, PR mode A and PR mode B, as indicated by the PR\_MODE
parameter in the assignment (see 3GPP TS 44.060):

\- in PR mode A, the PR value shall be calculated relative to the P0
value of the MS to which the RLC block is addressed;

\- in PR mode B, the network shall use the same P0 value for all the MS
with a TBF established on the same PDCH. Consequently, the PR value
shall be calculated relative to this P0 value.

The network shall not be allowed to change between PR modes during a
TBF. The network shall only allocate to an MS one PR\_MODE at a time.

NOTE: Correct MS behaviour can not be assumed if PR mode B is used with
adaptive antennas.

The MS is required to meet the 45.005 specification under the following
conditions:

For synchronisation purpose, the network shall ensure that each MS with
an active TBF in uplink or downlink receives at least one block
transmitted with a coding scheme and a modulation that can be decoded by
a MS using GPRS, EGPRS or EGPRS2 at least once every 360 millisecond
interval (78 TDMA frames) and by a MS using EC-GSM-IoT at least once
every 720 millisecond interval. As an exception, the network shall not
allocate any DL blocks to an MS with an active UL EC TBF for the
duration of a fixed uplink allocation (see 3GPP TS 44.060 \[19\]). If
downlink power control is used:

\- in PR mode A, this block shall be addressed (RLC information) to this
MS and shall contain a usable PR field (i.e. not set to Not usable as
specified in 3GPP TS 44.060);

\- in PR mode B, this block shall contain a usable PR field (i.e. not
set to Not usable as specified in 3GPP TS 44.060) and does not
necessarily have to be addressed to any particular MS. The PR field
remains optional in a downlink RLC/MAC control block (see 3GPP TS
44.060).

If downlink power control is used, the BTS shall limit its output power
on blocks addressed to a particular MS (USF or RLC blocks) to levels
between (BCCH level -- P0dB) and (BCCH level -- P0dB -- 10dB). For other
blocks the output power shall not exceed (BCCH level -- P0dB). For
COMPACT, the BCCH level shall be replaced by the CPBCCH level in these
formulas. The output power must be sufficient for the MS for which the
RLC block is intended as well as the MS(s) for which the USF is intended
(see 3GPP TS 44.060).

As an exception to the rules above, the bursts transmitted on the BCCH
carrier shall be transmitted at the BCCH level.

In DTM multislot configurations, if the BTS output power for the CS
timeslot is not within the range from the maximum downlink power allowed
for the MS on the PS timeslot(s) to a power level 10 dB lower, the MS is
not required to fulfil the requirements in 3GPP TS 45.005 on the CS
timeslot and/or the PS timeslot(s).

### 10.2.3 Measurements at MS side

A procedure shall be implemented in the MS to monitor periodically the
downlink Rx signal level and quality from its serving cell.

#### 10.2.3.1 Deriving the C value

##### 10.2.3.1.1 Packet idle mode or MAC-Idle state

In packet idle mode or MAC-Idle state, if EC operation is not enabled,
the MS shall periodically measure the received signal level of the PCCCH
or, if PCCCH is not existing, the CCCH or, for COMPACT, the CPCCCH or
CPBCCH, CFCCH, and CSCH. The MS shall measure the received signal level
of each paging block monitored by the MS according to its current DRX
mode and its paging group.

The normalised C value for each radio block is calculated:

C~block,n~ = SS~block,n~ + Pb (2)

where

SS~block,n~ is the mean of the received signal level of the four normal
bursts that compose the block.

Pb is the BTS output power reduction (relative to the output power used
on BCCH) used on the channel on which the measurements are performed.
For PCCCH, Pb is broadcast on PBCCH. If frequency hopping is being used
on the associated physical channel, Pb shall be reduced by 25% for each
burst in the block which is received on the BCCH frequency. For BCCH and
for COMPACT, Pb =0 (not broadcast).

Finally, the C~block,n~ values are filtered with a running average
filter:

C~n~ = (1-a) ∗ C~n-1~ + a ∗ C~block,n~,

where a is the forgetting factor:

a = 1/MIN(n, MAX(5, T~AVG\_W~\*N~DRX~)).

N~DRX~ = the average number of monitored blocks per multiframe (see 3GPP
TS 45.002).

T~AVG\_W~ is broadcast on PBCCH or, if PBCCH does not exist, on BCCH, or
on CPBCCH or optionally sent to mobile station in an RLC/MAC control
message (see 3GPP TS 44.060).

n is the iteration index. The filter shall be restarted with n=1 for the
first sample every time a new cell is selected. If the MS leaves
dedicated mode and then enters packet idle mode or MAC-Idle state, the
filter shall be restarted with n=1 for the first sample in case there is
no valid C value during dedicated mode. Otherwise, when entering packet
idle mode or MAC-Idle state, the filter shall continue from the n and
C~n~ values obtained during previous mode. The filter shall also
continue from its previous state if N~DRX~ is changed.

The current C~n~ value shall be used in formula (1) in subclause 10.2.1
to calculate the output power when the MS transfers its first radio
block.

A MS that has enabled EC operation shall measure the C value as
described in subclause 6.9.

##### 10.2.3.1.2 Packet transfer mode or MAC-Shared state

###### 10.2.3.1.2.1 MS that have not enabled EC operation

In packet transfer mode or MAC-Shared state, the MS shall use the same
received signal level measurements as made for cell reselection on the
BCCH carrier of the serving cell (see 10.1.1.2) or, for COMPACT, on the
CPBCCH carrier of the serving cell (see 12.4.1.2). The measurements
shall be filtered with a running average filter:

C~n~ = (1-b) ∗ C~n-1~ + b ∗ SS ~n~,

where

SS~n~ is the received signal level of the measurement samples.

b is the forgetting factor:

b = 1 for n=1;

b = 1/(6\*T~AVG\_T~).

n is the iteration index. The filter shall be restarted with n=1 for the
first sample at every cell change. When entering packet transfer mode
from packet idle mode or MAC-Shared state from MAC-Idle state, the
filter shall continue from the n and C~n~ values obtained during packet
idle mode or MAC-Idle state. In case the MS and the network support
enhanced DTM CS release procedure, when entering packet transfer mode
from DTM, the filter shall continue from the n and C~n~ values obtained
during DTM. When entering DTM from dedicated mode, the filter shall be
restarted with n=1 for the first sample in case there is no valid C
value during dedicated mode. In case the MS and the network support
enhanced DTM CS establishment procedure, when entering DTM from packet
transfer mode, the filter shall continue from the n and C~n~ values
obtained during packet transfer mode.

If indicated by the parameter PC\_MEAS\_CHAN, the MS shall instead
measure the received signal level of each radio block on one of the PDCH
s in BTTI configuration or on one of the PDCH-pairs in RTTI
configuration monitored by the MS for PACCH. If downlink power control
is used, PC\_MEAS\_CHAN shall indicate measurements on the BCCH or
CPBCCH, or the MS is not required to fulfil 45.005 requirements. The MS
may discard new PC\_MEAS\_CHAN values received during packet transfer
mode or MAC-Shared state. For each downlink radio block C~block,n~ shall
be derived according to formula (2) specified in 10.2.3.1.1 (if PBCCH
does not exist, and for COMPACT, Pb = 0). Finally, the C~block,n~ values
are filtered with a running average filter:

C~n~ = (1-c) ∗ C~n-1~ + c ∗ C~block,n~,

where c is the forgetting factor:

c = 1 for n=1;

c = 1/(12\*T~AVG\_T~).

n is the iteration index. The filter shall be restarted with n=1 for the
first sample at every cell change. When entering packet transfer mode
from packet idle mode or MAC-Shared state from MAC-Idle state, the
filter shall continue from the n and C~n~ values obtained during packet
idle mode or MAC-Idle state. In case the MS and the network support
enhanced DTM CS release procedure, when entering packet transfer mode
from DTM, the filter shall continue from the n and C~n~ values obtained
during DTM. When entering DTM from dedicated mode, the filter shall be
restarted with n=1 for the first sample in case there is no valid C
value during dedicated mode. In case the MS and the network support
enhanced DTM CS establishment procedure, when entering DTM from packet
transfer mode, the filter shall continue from the n and C~n~ values
obtained during packet transfer mode.

NOTE 1: This method is suitable in the case where BCCH or CPBCCH is in
another frequency band than the used PDCHs.

The current C~n~ value shall be used to update formula (1) in subclause
10.2.1 each time a new C~n~ value is obtained or whenever the MS applies
new Γ~CH~ or α values.

For each correctly received block on one of the PDCHs monitored by the
MS, the MS shall calculate the variance of the received signal level as:

BL\_VAR~n~ = 1/(j-1)\*SUM(SS~k~ - SS~block,n~)^2^, k = 1,\...,4

where SS~k~ is the received signal level of burst k within the block.

SS~block,n~ is the mean of the received signal level of the j normal
bursts that compose the radio block.

j is the number of bursts in the radio block = 4.

If frequency hopping is used and 1 burst of the block is received on the
BCCH carrier, that burst shall be discarded from the calculation (j =
3). If 2 bursts are received on the BCCH carrier, the whole block shall
be discarded. If 3 bursts are received on the BCCH carrier, the other
burst shall be discarded (j = 3).

If more than one PDCH are monitored the MS shall for each block period
try to find one correctly received block for the BL\_VAR calculation.
The block may be taken from any of the monitored PDCHs.

The reported value, SIGN\_VAR, shall be the average of BL\_VAR within
the reporting period. The first reporting period starts with and
includes the first assignment message for an uplink or downlink
transfer. The reporting period ends, and the subsequent reporting period
starts, no earlier than two blocks before the transmission of a quality
report and no later than one block before the transmission of a quality
report. In averaging, measurements made during previous reporting
periods shall always be discarded.

SIGN\_VAR shall be included in the channel quality report (see subclause
10.2.3.2.3). If the channel quality report is included in a PACKET
RESOURCE REQUEST message, which is retransmitted due to lack of response
(see 3GPP TS 44.060), the same or the most recent SIGN\_VAR value shall
be sent and no new reporting period shall be started. This will ensure
that a valid SIGN\_VAR value exists. The most recent SIGN\_VAR value
corresponds to the most recent average of BL\_VAR computed since the
beginning of the last reporting period.

T~AVG\_T~ and PC\_MEAS\_CHAN are broadcast on PBCCH or, if PBCCH does
not exist, on BCCH or on CPBCCH or optionally sent to mobile station in
an RLC/MAC control message (see 3GPP TS 44.060).

###### 10.2.3.1.2.2 MS that have enabled EC operation

A MS that has enabled EC operation shall for each correctly received
EC-PDTCH block and EC-PACCH block addressed to it derive C~block,n~ as
the mean of the received signal level of either all bursts of the block
if Coverage Class 1 is used, or of all blind physical layer
transmissions of all bursts of the block if a Coverage Class higher than
1 is used. The measured received signal level shall exclude
contributions from other sources such as interference and noise.

The C~block,n~ values are filtered with a running average filter:

C~n~ = (1-c) ∗ C~n-1~ + c ∗ C~block,n~,

where c is the forgetting factor defined as c = 1/(12\*T~AVG\_T~).

n is the iteration index.

When entering packet transfer mode from packet idle mode, the filter
shall be initiated with n=1 and C~0~ = the most recent C value obtained
during packet idle mode.

In addition, if the DL\_CC\_Selection parameter (see 3GPP TS 44.018
\[17\]) indicates that DL CC selection shall be based on SLA, the MS
shall for each block used to derive C~block,n~ as described above, also
derive I~block,n~ as the mean of the interference plus noise level of
all bursts of the block, if Coverage Class 1 is used, or of all blind
physical layer transmissions of all bursts of the block, if a Coverage
Class higher than 1 is used.

The I~block,n~ values are filtered with a running average filter:

I~n~ = (1-c) ∗ I~n-1~ + c ∗ I~block,n~,

where c is the forgetting factor defined above.

When entering packet transfer mode from packet idle mode, the filter
shall be initiated with n=1 and I~0~ = the most recent INA value (see
subclause 6.9) obtained during packet idle mode.

T~AVG\_T~ is not broadcast on EC-BCCH. A default value of T~AVG\_T~ =
\[1/3\] shall be used by the mobile station for EC TBF reception in CC1
or CC2 and a default value of T~AVG\_T~ = \[1/6\] for EC TBF reception
in CC3 or CC4. T~AVG\_T~ may be sent to the mobile station in an RLC/MAC
control message (see 3GPP TS 44.060 \[19\]) overwriting the default
value and being valid until the mobile station receives a new value in
the serving cell or until it reselects to another cell.

The current C~n~ value shall be used to update formula (1) in subclause
10.2.1 each time a new C~n~ value is obtained or whenever the MS applies
new Γ~CH~ or α values.

If the DL\_CC\_Selection parameter indicates that DL CC selection shall
be based on RLA\_EC, the current C~n~ is also reported to the BSS as the
C value, as described in subclause 10.2.3.2.3. If the DL\_CC\_Selection
parameter indicates that DL CC selection shall be based on SLA, the
current C~n~ and I~n~ are combined into the reported C value, as
described in subclause 10.2.3.2.3.

#### 10.2.3.2 Derivation of Channel Quality Report

The channel quality is measured as the interference signal level during
idle frames of the multiframe, when the serving cell is not
transmitting. No measurements shall be taken on the BCCH carrier of the
serving cell since the BTS transmits with constant output power on this
carrier. For COMPACT, the channel quality is measured as the
interference signal level during a PDTCH or PACCH block (see Annex C).
No measurements shall be taken on the CPBCCH, CPCCCH, PTCCH, CFCCH, or
CSCH since the BTS of the neighbouring co-channel cells either does not
transmit or transmits with constant output power.

##### 10.2.3.2.1 Packet transfer mode or MAC-Shared state

In case of a downlink dual carrier assignment, the measurements
specified in this subclause shall be made separately on both radio
frequency channels.

In case of a downlink multi carrier assignment, how to report the
measurements specified in this subclause is described in subclause
10.2.3.2.5.

In packet transfer mode or MAC-Shared state, the MS shall measure the
interference signal level on the same radio frequency channel(s) as the
assigned PDCHs. The MS shall make these measurements during the search
frames and PTCCH frames, which are not required for BSIC decoding or the
timing advance procedure. For COMPACT, the MS shall estimate the
interference level during PDTCH/PACCH bursts (see Annex C).

Additionally, a multi-RAT MS is allowed to ignore interference signal
level measurements in search frames according subclause 10.1.1.3.

The MS shall perform interference signal measurements on as many of the
channels (timeslots) as possible and as a minimum:

For multislot class type 1 MS (see 3GPP TS 45.002 \[22\]), on the PDCH
timeslot numbers TSmin to TSmax, where

> TSmin = the lowest numbered timeslot assigned (In case of downlink
> dual carrier assignment: on the respective radio frequency channel. In
> case of a downlink multi carrier assignment: on the lowest numbered
> radio frequency channel, or the radio frequency channel assigned for
> reporting (see 3GPP TS 44.060 \[19\])) for uplink or downlink transfer
> including downlink PACCH associated with an uplink transfer.
>
> TSmax = MIN(TSmin + Rx --1, 7).
>
> Rx = the maximum number of receive timeslots that the MS can use per
> TDMA frame according to its multislot class, or Equivalent multislot
> class in case of a downlink dual carrier assignment (see 3GPP
> TS 45.002 \[22\]).

In case of DTM, the type 1 MS shall perform interference measurements
also on the TCH timeslot. Interference measurements need not be
supported on PDCH timeslot numbers above the TCH timeslot plus one.

For multislot class type 2 MS (see 3GPP TS 45.002 \[22\]), on the
maximum number of receive timeslots (Rx) that the MS can use per TDMA
frame according to its multislot class, or Equivalent multislot class in
case of a downlink dual carrier assignment (see 3GPP TS 45.002 \[22\]),
in the following priority order, except that no measurements are
required on any timeslot number below those with priority 1:

1\) the PDCH timeslot numbers assigned for downlink transfer including
the downlink PACCH associated with an uplink transfer;

2\) the PDCH timeslot numbers assigned for uplink transfer;

3\) other timeslots that would be possible to add for downlink transfer
to the current assignment according to the MSs multislot class. If more
then one combination of timeslots is possible according to this rule, it
is implementation dependent which combination to chose.

Interference measurement timeslots have lower priority than real
receiver or transmit timeslot and are not compulsory in case of
conflict.

For each channel, every measurement SS~CH,n~ shall consist of the
minimum of the two signal level samples from one search frame and one
PTCCH frame. These two measurements should be spaced as closely as
possible, but there is no requirement that they shall be contiguous.
Thus the SACCH frames are avoided (except for a physical channel with
two TCH/Hs) and only the interference is measured. As an exception in
case of DTM, every measurement SS~CH,n~ on the TCH timeslot shall
consist of a signal level sample from one search frame only (since SACCH
transmission on this slot cannot occur at the search frame). For
COMPACT, for each channel, at least two interference measurement sample,
SS~CH,n~, shall shall be taken every multiframe.

The measured interference shall be averaged in a running average filter:

γ~CH,n~ = (1-d) ∗ γ~CH,n-1~ + d ∗ SS~CH,n~, γ~CH,\ 0~ = 0

where d is the forgetting factor:

d = 1/MIN(n, N~AVG\_I~).

n is the iteration index.

The filter shall be restarted with n=1 for the first sample when the MS
enters packet transfer mode or MAC-Shared state or every time a new cell
is selected. Channel reassignment during packet transfer mode or
MAC-Shared state shall be considered as start of a new packet transfer
mode or MAC-Shared state preceded by a zero length packet idle mode or
MAC-Idle state.

For each channel, the MS shall perform at least N~AVG\_I~ (rounded to
the nearest integer) measurements of SS~CH,n~ before valid γ~CH~ values
can be determined.

N~AVG\_I~ is broadcast on PBCCH or, if PBCCH does not exist, on BCCH or
CPBCCH or optionally sent to mobile station in an RLC/MAC control
message (see 3GPP TS 44.060).

During GPRS downlink TBF transfer, the MS shall measure the received
signal quality as defined in subclause 8.2. The reported value, RXQUAL,
shall be the average within the reporting period. Only successfully
decoded blocks intended for that MS shall be included in the average.
Alternatively, if CS4 only is used during the reporting period, the MS
is allowed to report RXQUAL = 7. If CS-4 is used with other CS within a
reporting period, the MS shall not take into account CS-4 blocks in the
calculation of RXQUAL: the MS shall compute the average taking into
account other CS only. If no block has been correctly decoded during the
reporting period, the MS shall report RXQUAL = 7, whatever the used CS.
The first reporting period starts with and includes the first assignment
message for the downlink transfer. The reporting period ends, and the
subsequent reporting starts, no earlier than two blocks before the
transmission of a quality report and no later than one block before the
transmission of a quality report. In averaging, measurements made during
previous reporting periods shall always be discarded.

During EGPRS and EC-GSM-IoT downlink TBF transfer, the MS shall measure
the received signal quality as defined in subclause 8.2.

In BTTI configuration, the quality parameters shall be, for the radio
blocks intended for this MS only (i.e. at least radio blocks where the
TFI identifying this MS can be decoded from the RLC/MAC header and radio
blocks where the TFI identifying this MS can be decoded from the RLC/MAC
control block header: see 3GPP TS 44.060), individually averaged per
channel (timeslot, or, for EC-GSM-IoT, if a Coverage Class higher than 1
is used, set of timeslots across which blind physical layer
transmissions of the same burst are received, where one BEP value is
derived, and where TN is the lowest numbered timeslot of the timeslot
set) and per modulation type as follows:

In RTTI configuration, the quality parameters shall be, for the radio
blocks intended for this MS only (i.e. at least radio blocks where the
TFI identifying this MS can be decoded from the RLC/MAC header and radio
blocks where the TFI identifying this MS can be decoded from the RLC/MAC
control block header: see 3GPP TS 44.060 \[19\]), individually averaged
per channel (timeslot pair where TN is the lower numbered timeslot of
the timeslot pair) and per modulation type as follows:

An MS shall calculate the overall MEAN\_BEP, and CV\_BEP per modulation
type as average over all assigned channels (timeslots, timeslot pairs
or, for EC-GSM-IoT, if a Coverage Class higher than 1 is used, sets of
timeslots across which blind physical layer transmissions of the same
burst are received, where one BEP value is derived) irrespective whether
blocks were received on a channel (timeslot, timeslot pair where TN is
the lower numbered timeslot of the timeslot pair, or timeslot set where
TN is the lowest numbered timeslot of the timeslot set) since it last
sent a measurement report to the network as follows:

where n = the iteration index at reporting time

j = the channel number.

In averaging, measurements made during previous reporting periods shall
always be discarded.

When entering packet transfer mode or MAC-Shared state and/or when
selecting a new cell, the filters shall reset the values of n to 0. When
a new channel (timeslot, timeslot pair or timeslot set) is assigned for
a downlink TBF, the filters shall reset the values of MEAN\_BEP\_TN
~n-1~ , CV\_BEP\_TN ~n-1~ and R ~n-1~ to 0 for this channel (timeslot,
timeslot pair where TN is the lower numbered timeslot of the timeslot
pair or timeslot set where TN is the lowest numbered timeslot of the
timeslot set). If frequency hopping is used, channels that only differ
in MAIO shall not be considered new in this context.

The reporting period ends no earlier than two blocks for a GPRS TBF mode
and three blocks for an EGPRS TBF mode before the transmission of a
quality report and no later than one block before the transmission of a
quality report.

##### 10.2.3.2.2 Void

##### 10.2.3.2.3 Measurement reporting

A MS using GPRS shall transfer γ~CH~ values and the RXQUAL, C and
SIGN\_VAR values (see subclause 10.2.3.1.2) to the network in the
Channel Quality Report on PACCH. An MS using EGPRS or EGPRS2 shall
instead of RXQUAL and SIGN\_VAR send MEAN\_BEP and CV\_BEP.

An MS that has enabled EC operation shall send C, MEAN\_BEP and CV\_BEP.
The reported C value shall be C (as defined in subclause 10.2.3.1.2.2)
if the DL\_CC\_Selection parameter indicates RLA\_EC based DL CC
selection, or C -- I (where C and I are defined in subclause
10.2.3.1.2.2) if the DL\_CC\_Selection parameter indicates SLA based DL
CC selection.

In case of EGPRS or EC-GSM-IoT the MS shall report the overall MEAN\_BEP
and CV\_BEP for the modulations, GMSK and/or 8-PSK (i.e.
GMSK\_MEAN\_BEP, GMSK\_CV\_BEP; and/or 8PSK\_MEAN\_BEP, 8PSK\_CV\_BEP
respectively) for which it has received blocks on at least one allocated
channel (timeslot, timeslot pair or timeslot set) since it last sent a
measurement report to the network.

Additionally, in case of EGPRS, the MS shall report MEAN\_BEP\_TNx on a
per timeslot basis in BTTI configuration, or on a per timeslot pair
basis in RTTI configuration where TNx is the lower numbered timeslot of
the timeslot pair according to what the network has ordered (see 3GPP TS
44.060 \[19\]). An MS shall only include MEAN\_BEP\_TNx values for the
modulation scheme with which it has received the larger number of blocks
on its currently assigned channels (timeslots or timeslot pairs) since
it last sent a measurement report to the network.

In case of EGPRS2 downlink the MS shall report the MEAN\_BEP and CV\_BEP
for up to two modulations schemes for all timeslots in the TBF using the
EGPRS BEP Link Quality Measurements Type 2 IE (see 3GPP TS 44.060
\[19\]). The selection of the modulation schemes to report is based on
the blocks which it has received since it last sent a measurement report
to the network.

In the case of EGPRS2-A downlink, the MS shall report the MEAN\_BEP and
CV\_BEP only for the two modulation schemes with the highest number of
received blocks, not including RLC/MAC control blocks. If an equal
number of blocks have been received for two or more modulation schemes
that are subject to reporting, the selection of which of these
modulation schemes to report is implementation dependent.

In the case of EGPRS2-B downlink, the MS shall report the MEAN\_BEP and
CV\_BEP for the (at most two) modulation schemes with the highest
non-zero values of N\_BLOCKS\_WEIGHTED, where:

\- N\_BLOCKS\_WEIGHTED = 2 x N\_BLOCKS, if the modulation scheme is
\'preferred\',

\- otherwise, N\_BLOCKS\_WEIGHTED = min(N\_BLOCKS, BEP\_PERIOD2, RP/2),
if BEP\_PERIOD2 has been received by the mobile station or
N\_BLOCKS\_WEIGHTED = min(N\_BLOCKS, BEP\_PERIOD,RP/2) if BEP\_PERIOD2
has not been received by the mobile station,

\- N\_BLOCKS is the number of blocks using the modulation scheme that
were received with a TFI value associated with a TBF corresponding to
the mobile station since the previous report, not including RLC/MAC
control blocks,

\- RP is the number of basic radio block periods that have elapsed since
the previous report (i.e. the previous instance of the EGPRS BEP Link
Quality Measurements Type 2 IE) was transmitted,

\- EGPRS2-B modulation schemes which are \'preferred\' are: GMSK, QPSK,
16-QAM HSR and 32-QAM HSR.

In case two or more modulation schemes that are subject to reporting
have an equal value of N\_BLOCKS\_WEIGHTED, the modulation scheme with
higher N\_BLOCKS shall be reported in preference. If these modulation
schemes have also equal values of N\_BLOCKS, the selection of which of
these modulation schemes to report is implementation dependent.

If fewer than two modulation schemes other than GMSK have non-zero
values of N\_BLOCKS\_WEIGHTED and one or more RLC/MAC control blocks
with a TFI value associated with a TBF corresponding to the mobile
station were received since the previous report, the MS shall also
report the link quality for GMSK.

EGPRS2-B downlink is not supported in case of downlink multi carrier
assignment.

Additionally, in case of EGPRS2, if commanded by the network according
to the LINK\_QUALITY\_MEASUREMENT\_MODE field, the MS shall report both
MEAN\_BEP\_TNx and REPORTED\_MODULATION on a per timeslot (in BTTI
configuration) or timeslot pair (in RTTI configuration where TNx is the
lower number timeslot of the timeslot pair) basis as specified in the
EGPRS Timeslot Link Quality Measurements Type 2 IE. More specifically,
for each of its currently assigned timeslots or timeslot pairs, an MS
shall report the modulation scheme (indicated using the
REPORTED\_MODULATION field) with which it has received the greatest
number of blocks since the last report and shall report the
MEAN\_BEP\_TNx of that modulation scheme (see 3GPP TS 44.060 \[19\]). In
case there are more than one modulation scheme having the same number
and the largest number of blocks on a currently assigned timeslot, the
MS shall report the MEAN\_BEP\_TNx for the highest order modulation
scheme among those modulation schemes on that timeslot.

The report contains the available γ~CH~ values for the radio frequency
channel on which the message is sent as well as the RXQUAL, C and
SIGN\_VAR values (see subclause 10.2.3.1.2) or in case of EGPRS, EGPRS2
and EC-GSM-IoT the MEAN\_BEP, C and CV\_BEP values, except for a
downlink dual carrier assignment (see subclause 10.2.3.2.4) and multi
carrier assignment (see subclause 10.2.3.2.5).

The conditions for including the different values, which are not always
mandatory, are specified in 3GPP TS 44.060 \[19\]. The mapping of γ~ch~
to the reported I\_LEVEL value is defined in subclause 10.3.

##### 10.2.3.2.4 Measurement reporting - additional requirements for downlink dual carrier

In case of a downlink dual carrier assignment, the γ~CH~, C, MEAN\_BEP
(overall and per timeslot or timeslot pair measurements) and CV\_BEP
values may be reported for each of the radio frequency channels as
specified in 3GPP TS 44.060.

If the required set of the measurements (overall MEAN\_BEP and CV\_BEP,
MEAN\_BEP\_TNx measurements and / or γ~ch~) to be reported for a given
carrier as specified in sub-clause 10.2.3.2.3 does not fit in the
message used for sending the measurements (see 3GPP TS 44.060) and would
otherwise include the overall MEAN\_BEP and CV\_BEP for two candidate
modulations, the mobile station shall, for the corresponding carrier,
only send the overall MEAN\_BEP and CV\_BEP for a single modulation,
selected as follows:

\- in case of EGPRS or EGPRS2-A, the modulation scheme for which it has
received the highest number of blocks since it last sent a measurement
report; if an equal number of blocks have been received for the two
candidate modulation schemes, the selection of which of these modulation
schemes to report is implementation dependent;

\- in case of EGPRS2-B, the modulation scheme with the highest non zero
value of N\_BLOCKS\_WEIGHTED; if the two candidate modulation schemes
have equal non zero value of N\_BLOCKS\_WEIGHTED, the modulation scheme
with higher N\_BLOCKS shall be reported in preference; if these two
modulation schemes have also equal values of N\_BLOCKS, the selection of
which of these modulation schemes to report is implementation dependent.

In addition, when not all MEAN BEP\_TNx measurements can be included in
the message used for reporting the measurements, the selection of the
timeslots for which MEAN BEP\_TNx measurements are included is left
implementation dependent.

##### 10.2.3.2.5 Measurement reporting - additional requirements for downlink multi carrier

In case of a downlink multi carrier assignment:

\- the overall MEAN\_BEP and CV\_BEP shall be reported per carrier, or
per UFPS as indicated by the applicable assignment message (see 3GPP TS
44.060).

\- In case of per carrier based reporting additional per timeslot or
timeslot pair MEAN\_BEP may be reported.

\- In case of UFPS based reporting, a single representative value for
the overall MEAN\_BEP and CV\_BEP respectively, averaged over all
assigned channels belonging to the same UFPS, is reported for one or two
modulations.

\- the C values shall be reported in a single value. If the parameter
PC\_MEAS\_CHAN indicates that the downlink measurements for power
control shall be made on PDCH a single value shall be reported for the
carrier/UFPS (depending on if carrier based or UFPS based reporting is
used, see 3GPP TS 44.060) on which the MS was polled.

\- the γ~CH~ provides the interference measurement information and is
reported for the radio frequency channel with lowest number, or on the
assigned carrier for reporting as indicated by the applicable assignment
message (see 3GPP TS 44.060). γ~CH~ is reported for a single radio
frequency channel regardless if radio frequency channels are assigned in
one or two frequency bands.If the required set of measurements (overall
MEAN\_BEP, overall CV\_BEP, C value, MEAN\_BEP\_TNx and γ~ch~) to be
reported as specified in sub-clause 10.2.3.2.3 does not fit in the
message used for sending the measurements (see 3GPP TS 44.060) the
mobile station shall always send the overall MEAN\_BEP and CV\_BEP for
the carrier/UFPS (depending on if carrier based or UFPS based reporting
is used, see 3GPP TS 44.060) on which the poll was received. If there is
room in the message the MS shall report overall MEAN\_BEP and CV\_BEP
for additional carrier(s)/UFPS(s) (if any) beginning with the next in
sequence carrier/UFPS (see 3GPP TS 44.060 for carrier/UFPS numbering).
If there is not enough room for including an additional carrier/UFPS in
the reporting message then the mobile station may attempt to enable its
inclusion by only reporting the overall MEAN\_BEP and CV\_BEP for a
single modulation for that carrier/UFPS. If the attempt is successful
then the single modulation reported shall be that for which the MS has
received the highest number of blocks since it last sent a measurement
report; if an equal number of blocks have been received for the two
candidate modulation schemes, the selection of which of these modulation
schemes to report is implementation dependent.

#### 10.2.3.3 Range of parameters MEAN\_BEP and CV\_BEP for EGPRS2

The mapping of the MEAN\_BEP to the equivalent BEP and the accuracies to
which an MS shall be capable of estimating the quality parameters under
static channel conditions are given in the following tables for EGPRS2-A
DL (16-QAM and 32-QAM) and for EGPRS2-B DL (QPSK, 16-QAM and 32-QAM)
respectively. The accuracy requirements below apply for sensitivity
limited operation for signal levels above the reference sensitivity
level for the type of MS, assuming no changes in transmitted downlink
power. The requirements apply for PDTCH/F in *A/Gb mode*, and the
estimated values are averaged applying filtering according to subclause
10.2.3.2.1 with forgetting factor of 0.03.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------ --------------------- --------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For a coding on 4 bits, i.e. for timeslot based EGPRS2 link quality
reports, the 4 most significant bits are used.

NOTE1: MEAN\_BEP is calculated and filtered according to the procedure
described in section 10.2.3.2.1.

NOTE2: The accuracy requirements above take into account possible
fluctuations of the bit error rate due to adaptiveness of receivers.

NOTE3: Testing requires measurement of the actual bit error rate and
assessment of MEAN\_BEP reports based on the same period of time.

The mapping table for the coefficient of variation of the channel
quality is defined as follows for QPSK, 16-QAM and 32-QAM:

  ----------- ------ --------------- ------
  CV\_BEP 0   2.00   \> CV\_BEP \>   1.75
  CV\_BEP 1   1.75   \> CV\_BEP \>   1.50
  CV\_BEP 2   1.50   \> CV\_BEP \>   1.25
  CV\_BEP 3   1.25   \> CV\_BEP \>   1.00
  CV\_BEP 4   1.00   \> CV\_BEP \>   0.75
  CV\_BEP 5   0.75   \> CV\_BEP \>   0.50
  CV\_BEP 6   0.50   \> CV\_BEP \>   0.25
  CV\_BEP 7   0.25   \> CV\_BEP \>   0.00
  ----------- ------ --------------- ------

The accuracy requirements for CV\_BEP need not be specified since they
are directly linked to those for MEAN\_BEP. Nevertheless, the CV\_BEP
measured at the MS shall be the one used by this MS.

### 10.2.4 Measurements at BSS side

A procedure shall be implemented in the BSS to monitor the uplink Rx
signal level and quality on each uplink PDCH, active as well as
inactive.

The BSS shall also measure the Rx signal level and the quality of a
specific MS packet transfer.

10.2a Packet-switched Handover
------------------------------

If an MS receives a packet-switched handover command towards a GSM cell
which it is not synchronised to, then the MS shall search for
synchronisation information up to 300 ms. In case of failure, the MS
shall indicate a packet cell change failure (see 3GPP TS 44.060).

If a multi-RAT MS receives a packet-switched handover command towards a
not known cell (see 3GPP TS 25.133 and 3GPP TS 25.123 for UTRAN or 3GPP
TS 36.133 for E-UTRAN), then the multi-RAT MS shall search for
synchronisation information up to 800 ms. In case of failure, the
multi-RAT MS shall indicate a packet cell change failure (see 3GPP TS
44.060).

Details of the synchronization mechanisms appear in 3GPP TS 45.010.

10.3 Measurement requirements
-----------------------------

The accuracy of the received signal level and interference measurements
shall be as defined in subclause 8.1.2. For COMPACT, the accuracy of the
interference estimate, which is based upon received signal level during
a PDTCH/PACCH block (see Annex C), is ± 2 dB in addition to the accuracy
of the received signal level defined in subclause 8.1.2 without downlink
power control activated on the serving cell. The measured signal
strength values shall be mapped to the reported C values as defined for
RXLEV in subclause 8.1.4. If included in a PACKET DOWNLINK ACK/NACK or a
PACKET RESOURCE REQUEST message, the measured interference level, γ~CH~,
shall be mapped to a reported I\_LEVEL value between 0 and 15, relative
to reported C value as follows:

I\_LEVEL 0 = interference level is greater than C\
I\_LEVEL 1 = interference level is less than or equal to C and greater
than C - 2 dB\
I\_LEVEL 2 = interference level is less than or equal to C - 2 dB and
greater than C - 4 dB\
:\
:\
I\_LEVEL 14 = interference level is less than or equal to C - 26 dB and
greater than C - 28 dB\
I\_LEVEL 15 = interference level is less than or equal to C - 28 dB

10.4 Control parameters

A non-exhaustive list of parameters employed to control the radio links
for GPRS are shown in table 3.

NOTE: (\*\*) These parameters occur also on BCCH if PBCCH does not
exist.

NOTE 1: If PBCCH does not exist, the MS shall perform cell re-selection
according to the idle mode procedures defined in clause 6 (i.e. use
parameter Qsearch\_I). In case parameter Qsearch\_P is broadcast on BCCH
it shall be used according to clause 10 only if GPRS cell re-selection
parameters for one or more cells are provided to the MS in a Packet Cell
Change Order or Packet Measurement Order message.

NOTE 2: In case an optional parameter is not included in a
point-to-point signalling message, the default value of that parameter
shall replace any previously broadcast value, where applicable.

  --------------------- ------------------------- -----------------------------

NOTE 1: A low priority cell is only selected if there are no suitable
cells of normal priority (see 3GPP TS 43.022).

The conversion of the PENALTY\_TIME into the GPRS\_PENALTY\_TIME shall
be done by use of the timer values (e.g. PENALTY\_TIME = 40s -\>
GPRS\_PENALTY\_TIME 2 = 40s). Similarly, dB values shall be used for
GPRS\_RESELECT\_OFFSET(n) conversion.

11 CTS mode tasks
=================

11.1 CTS idle mode tasks
------------------------

Whilst attempting to attach to a CTS-FP, a CTS-MS shall implement the
CTS cell selection  procedure described in 3GPP TS 43.022. This
procedure makes use of measurements and sub‑procedures described in this
clause. The procedure ensures that the CTS-MS is CTS attached to a CTS
cell from which it can reliably decode downlink data and where access to
CTS service is allowed.

Whilst in CTS idle mode, the CTS-MS shall implement procedures reporting
to the CTS-FP (AFA monitoring, BCCH detection and OFO measurement),
described in 3GPP TS 43.022. These procedure makes use of measurements
and sub-procedures described in this clause, and are used for the
frequency control of the system, described in 3GPP TS 45.056 and 3GPP TS
45.010.

This clause makes use of terms defined in 3GPP TS 43.022.

For the purpose of CTS cell selection, the CTS-MS shall be capable of
detecting and synchronizing to a CTSBCH carrier and read the CTSBCH-SB
data at reference sensitivity level and reference interference levels as
specified in 3GPP TS 45.005. A CTS-MS in CTS idle mode shall always
fulfil the performance requirement specified in 3GPP TS 45.005 at levels
down to reference sensitivity level or reference interference level.

For the purpose of CTS cell selection, the CTS-MS shall compute an
average of received signal levels for the CTSBCH carrier. This quantity
called 'received level average' shall be unweighted average of the
received signal level measured in dBm. The accuracy of the signal level
measurements for CTS cell selection and the other idle mode tasks shall
be the same as for radio link measurements.

The tolerance on all the timing requirements in this subclause is ±10 %.

### 11.1.1 CTS cell selection

#### 11.1.1.1 Synchronization and measurements for CTS cell selection

The CTS-MS shall store the CTSBCH ARFCN for each CTS-FP the CTS-MS is
enrolled with.

In the modes where CTS cell selection is required (see 3GPP TS 43.022),
for each CTS-FP the CTS-MS is enrolled with, the CTS-MS shall
periodically attempt to synchronize to the stored CTSBCH carrier. When
attempting to synchronize to the CTSBCH carrier, the CTS-MS shall
attempt to detect the frequency correction burst of the CTSBCH-FB and
when detected, to decode the synchronization burst of the CTSBCH-SB and
read the CTSBCH-SB information. The CTS-MS shall calculate the received
level average of the CTSBCH carrier, the averaging being based on at
least five measurement samples taken on the CTSBCH bursts.

The maximum time allowed to synchronize to a CTSBCH carrier and read the
CTSBCH-SB information shall be 5 seconds.

#### 11.1.1.2 Initial sychronization of CTS-MS

In order to perform upper layer procedures, e.g. the enrolment of a
CTS-MS (see 3GPP TS 44.056), a special procedure shall be implemented in
the CTS-FP, by which the initial synchronisation of a CTS-MS with the
CTS-FP is eased. This procedure of initial synchronisation of CTS-MS
shall be triggered by the CTS upper layers.

The procedure consists in transmitting the CTSBCH in every TDMA frame
with the following pattern :

if FN mod 52 = 25 then the CTSBCH-FB is transmitted

else

if FN mod 2 = 0 then the CTSBCH-FB is transmitted

if FN mod 2 = 1 then the CTSBCH-SB is transmitted

The first burst sent with this pattern shall be the next programmed
CTSBCH-FB on the TDMA frame : FN mod 52 = 25. The above transmission
pattern shall be repeated for a period of 120 52-multiframe. No CTSBCH
shifting shall be allowed during the pattern: the CTSBCH timeslot number
shall be the TNC, see 3GPP TS 45.002.

The CTS-MS shall attempt to synchronize to the CTSBCH transmitted with
the above pattern. Once synchronized, the CTS-MS shall perform the
non-hopping access procedure, e.g. for enrolment purpose (see 3GPP TS
44.056). Upon reception of the access request message by the CTS-FP, the
pattern transmission shall be stopped.

### 11.1.2 Criterion for CTS cell selection

The path loss criterion parameter C1\_CTS used for CTS cell selection is
defined by:

C1\_CTS = Received Level Average ‑ CTS\_RXLEV\_ACCESS\_MIN

where: CTS\_RXLEV\_ACCESS\_MIN = Minimum received level at the CTS-MS
required for access to the system ; this parameter shall be given by the
CTS-FP to CTS-MS during the enrolment procedure (see 3GPP TS 44.056) and
shall be stored in the CTS-MS for each CTS-FP it is enrolled with. The
parameter can be updated on request of the CTS-FP.

All values are expressed in dBm.

The path loss criterion (3GPP TS 43.022) is satisfied if C1\_CTS \> 0.

### 11.1.3 Monitoring of CTSBCH and CTSPCH

#### 11.1.3.1 Monitoring of received signal level

Whilst in CTS idle mode, the CTS-MS shall measure the received signal
level of the CTSBCH and shall calculate the received level average of
the CTSBCH carrier, the averaging being a running average on at least
five collected measurement samples and a maximum time of 11 seconds
(5\*9\*52 frames). The criterion C2\_CTS defined below shall be
calculated every time the CTS-MS decodes the CTSBCH in its CTS paging
group :

C2\_CTS = C1\_CTS + CTS\_CELL\_RESELECT\_OFFSET

If the criterion C2\_CTS falls below zero for a period of 15 seconds,
the CTS-MS shall considered itself as de-attached with the CTS-FP and
shall perform the CTS cell selection specified in subclause 11.1.1.

#### 11.1.3.2 Downlink beacon failure

The downlink beacon failure criterion is based on the downlink beacon
failure counter DBC. Whilst in CTS idle mode on a CTS cell, DBC shall be
initialized to a value equal to the nearest integer to 90/N where N is
the number of paging groups defined for the CTS-FP (see 3GPP TS 45.002
subclause 6.5.7). Thereafter, whenever the CTS-MS attempts to decode
CTSBCH-SB information bits (see 3GPP TS 45.002): if the information bits
are successfully decoded DBC is increased by 1, however never beyond the
initial value, otherwise DBC is decreased by 4. When DBC ≤ 0, a downlink
beacon failure shall be declared.

If a downlink beacon failure occurs, the CTS-MS shall consider itself as
de-attached with the CTS-FP and shall perform the CTS cell selection
specified in subclause 11.1.1.

#### 11.1.3.3 Downlink paging failure

The downlink paging failure criterion is based on the downlink paging
failure counter DPC. Whilst in CTS idle mode on a CTS cell, DPC shall be
initialized to a value equal to CTSPCH\_DECOD (this parameter shall be
given by the CTS-FP to the CTS-MS during the attachment procedure, see
3GPP TS 44.056). Thereafter, each time the CTS-MS is required to decode
a paging message on the CTSPCH (see 3GPP TS 45.002 subclause 6.5.1 ix)):
if the paging message is not successfully decoded (BFI = 1) DPC is
decreased by 1, otherwise DPC is re-initialized to CTSPCH\_DECOD. When
DPC ≤ 0, a downlink paging failure shall be declared.

If a downlink paging failure occurs, the CTS-MS shall consider itself as
de-attached with the CTS-FP and shall perform the CTS cell selection
specified in subclause 11.1.1.

### 11.1.4 Procedures with reporting to the CTS-FP

Whilst in CTS idle mode, the CTS-FP may order to the CTS-MS to complete
the procedures defined hereafter. The order for each procedure is sent
to the CTS-MS during a dedicated connection (see 3GPP TS 44.056).

For each of the procedures, a maximum time of processing is allowed.
When multiple procedures are ordered in a single dedicated connection,
the results shall be ready to be reported to the CTS-FP when the time
corresponding to the sum of the maximum time of each procedure has
expired.

#### 11.1.4.1 AFA monitoring

The reporting of the AFA monitoring procedure is used by the AFA
algorithm for the frequency management of the CTS (see 3GPP TS 45.056).

The parameters sent by the CTS-FP to the CTS-MS in the AFA monitoring
order message shall be a list of n carriers : AFA monitoring frequency
list, AMFL(1,\...,n), together with the number of AFA monitoring cycles
NAMC to perform.

For each carrier of the AMFL, the CTS-MS shall perform NAMC basic
measurements, where a basic measurement shall be the average received
signal level on the 8 timeslots of the TDMA frame. The delay between two
consecutive basic measurements shall be at least 5 seconds. The received
interference level of the carrier shall be the maximum of the NAMC basic
measurements.

The maximum processing time for this procedure shall be (NAMC x 10)
seconds.

When ordered by the CTS-FP, the CTS-MS shall report in the next AFA
monitoring report message a table of received interference level of the
carrier of the AMFL, INTERF\_LEV (1,...,n), together with the minimum of
the numbers of performed AFA monitoring cycles, NAMC\_REAL ; the
procedure shall be stopped.

#### 11.1.4.2 BCCH detection

The reporting of the BCCH detection procedure may be used by the CTS-FP
by the AFA algorithm and for the OFO request.

The parameters sent by the CTS-FP to the CTS-MS in the BCCH detection
message shall be a list of m carriers : BCCH detection frequency list,
BDFL(1,..,m).

For each carrier of the list, the CTS-MS shall attempt to synchronize to
it and decode the SCH. The BCCH detection shall be failed (BCCH not
detected) if the CTS-MS fails to decode the SCH.

The procedure shall be completed in maximum (m x 10) seconds

When ordered by the CTS-FP, the CTS-MS shall report in the next BCCH
detection report message a table of BCCH detection status of the
carriers of the list, BCCH\_DETECT (1, ..., m) ; the procedure shall be
stopped.

#### 11.1.4.3 Observed Frequency Offset (OFO) measurement

The reported OFO measurements shall be used by the CTS-FP to correct its
frequency source (see 3GPP TS 45.010).

The parameters sent by the CTS-FP to the CTS-MS in the OFO measurement
message shall be a list of k BCCH carriers : OFO measurement BCCH list,
OMBL(1,..,k).

For each BCCH carrier of the list, the CTS-MS shall attempt to assess
the frequency offset between the BCCH carrier and the CTS-FP. The
measurement status shall be \"failed\" if an offset measurement accuracy
better than 0.2 ppm cannot be ensured.

The procedure shall be completed in maximum (k x 15) seconds

When ordered by the CTS-FP, the CTS-MS shall report in the next OFO
measurement report message the table of OFO measurements and measurement
status of the BCCH carriers of the list : OFO\_MEAS(1,...,k),
OFO\_STATUS(1, ...,k) ; the procedure shall be stopped.

11.2 Intra-cell handover
------------------------

### 11.2.1 Overall process

The overall intra-cell handover process is implemented in the CTS-MS and
CTS-FP. Measurement of radio subsystem downlink performance is made in
the CTS-MS. These measurements are signalled to the CTS-FP for
assessment. The CTS-FP measures the uplink performance for the CTS-MS
being served. Initial assessment of the measurements in conjunction with
defined thresholds and intra-cell handover strategy shall be performed
in the CTS-FP.

### 11.2.2 CTS-MS measurement procedure

A procedure shall be implemented in the CTS-MS by which it monitors the
downlink RX signal level and quality from its serving CTS cell. The
requirements for the CTS-MS measurements are given in subclause 11.5.

### 11.2.3 CTS-FP measurement procedure

A procedure shall be implemented in the CTS-FP by which it monitors the
uplink RX signal level and quality from each CTS-MS being served by the
CTS cell.

### 11.2.4 Strategy

The intra-cell handover strategy employed by the CTS-FP for radio link
control determines the handover decision that will be made based on the
CTS measurement results reported by the CTS-MS and made by the CTS-FP,
and on various parameters set for each CTS-FP.

Due to the Total Frequency Hopping applied to the traffic channels in
CTS, intra‑cell handover can only occur to a different timeslot of the
CTS cell.

Intra‑cell handover from one timeslot in the CTS cell to another
timeslot in the same CTS cell will normally be performed if the CTS
measurement results show a low RXQUAL, but a high RXLEV on the serving
CTS cell. This indicates a degradation of quality caused by interference
even though the CTS-MS is situated within the coverage area of the
serving CTS cell. The intra‑cell handover should provide a timeslot with
a lower level of interference.

11.3 RF power control
---------------------

### 11.3.1 Overall process

RF power control is employed to minimize the transmit power required by
CTS-MS or CTS-FP whilst maintaining the quality of the radio links. By
minimizing the transmit power levels, interference to co‑channel users
is reduced.

### 11.3.2 CTS-MS implementation

RF power control shall be implemented in the CTS-MS.

The power control level to be employed by the CTS-MS on the uplink
channel is indicated by means of the power control information sent
either in the layer 1 header of each SACCH message block (see 3GPP TS
44.004) on the corresponding downlink channel, or in a dedicated
signalling block (see 3GPP TS 44.056).

The CTS-MS shall employ the most recently commanded power control level
(parameter CTS\_MS\_TXPWR\_REQUEST) for all transmitted bursts on either
a TCH, FACCH or SACCH.

The CTS-MS shall confirm the power control level that it is currently
employing in the SACCH L1 header on the uplink (parameter
CTS\_MS\_TXPWR\_CONF). The indicated value shall be the power control
level actually used by the CTS-MS for the last burst of the previous
SACCH period.

When accessing a cell on the ARCH (CTS access request) and before
receiving the first power command during a communication on a TCH (after
a CTS immediate assignment message), the CTS-MS shall use the power
control level defined by the CTS\_MS\_MAX\_TXPWR parameters ; this
parameters shall be given by the CTS-FP to the CTS-MS during the
enrolment procedure, and can be updated on request of the CTS-FP.

If a power control level defined in 3GPP TS 45.005 is received but the
level is not supported by the CTS-MS, the CTS-MS shall use the supported
output power which is closest to the output power indicated by the
received power control level.

### 11.3.3 CTS-MS power control range

The range over which a CTS-MS shall be capable of varying its RF output
power shall be from its maximum authorized output power
CTS\_MS\_MAX\_TXPWR, down its lowest nominal output power (as defined in
3GPP TS 45.005), in steps of nominally 2 dB.

3GPP TS 45.005 gives a detailed definition of the RF power level step
size and tolerances for a CTS-MS.

### 11.3.4 CTS-FP implementation

RF power control shall be implemented in the CTS-FP.

### 11.3.5 CTS-FP power control range

The range over which a CTS-FP shall be capable of varying its RF output
power shall be from its maximum authorized output power
CTS\_FP\_MAX\_TXPWR down its lowest nominal output power (as defined in
3GPP TS 45.056), in steps of nominally 2 dB.

3GPP TS 45.056 gives a detailed definition of the RF power level step
size and tolerances for a CTS-FP.

### 11.3.6 Strategy

The RF power control strategy employed by the CTS-FP determines the
ordered power control level that is signalled to the CTS-MS, and the
power control level that is employed by the CTS-FP.

The power control level to be employed in each case shall be based on
the CTS measurement results reported by the CTS-MS and made by the
CTS-FP, and on various parameters set for each CTS-FP.

If the CTS-MS reports in each CTS measurement results a RXQUAL\_0 and a
RXLEV greater or equal to 31, for a period of 30 seconds, the CTS-FP RF
output power shall be at the end of this period the lowest nominal
output power specified in 3GPP TS 45.056.

Under static interference free conditions, if the CTS-MS signal level
received by the CTS-FP is greater or equal to -85 dBm for a period of 30
seconds, the CTS-FP shall command the CTS-MS to reduce its RF output
power, so that the CTS-MS RF output power is at the end of this period
the lowest nominal output power specified in 3GPP TS 45.005.

### 11.3.7 Timing

Upon receipt of a command from an SACCH to change its power level, the
CTS-MS shall change to the new level at a rate of one nominal 2 dB power
control step every 60 ms (13 TDMA frames), i.e. a range change of 15
steps should take about 900 ms. The change shall begin at the first TDMA
frame belonging to the next reporting period (as specified in
subclause 11.5.4). The CTS-MS shall change the power one nominal 2 dB
step at a time, at a rate of one step every 60 ms following the initial
change, irrespective of whether actual transmission takes place or not.

In case of intra-cell handover, the commanded power control level shall
be applied on the new timeslot immediately.

11.4 Radio link failure
-----------------------

### 11.4.1 Criterion

The criterion for determining Radio Link Failure in the CTS-MS shall be
based on the success rate of decoding messages on the downlink SACCH.

### 11.4.2 CTS-MS procedure

The aim of determining radio link failure in the CTS-MS is to ensure
that calls with unacceptable voice/data quality, which cannot be
improved either by RF power control or intra-cell handover, are either
re‑established or released in a defined manner.

The radio link failure criterion is based on the radio link counter
S\_CTS. If the CTS-MS is unable to decode a SACCH message (BFI = 1),
S\_CTS is decreased by 1. In the case of a successful reception of a
SACCH message (BFI = 0) S\_CTS is increased by 2. In any case S\_CTS
shall not exceed the value of CTS\_RADIO\_LINK\_TIMEOUT. If S\_CTS
reaches 0 a CTS radio link failure shall be declared. The action to be
taken is specified in 3GPP TS 44.056. The CTS\_RADIO\_LINK\_TIMEOUT
parameter is transmitted by the CTS-FP to the CTS-MS during the
attachment procedure (see 3GPP TS 44.056). For the attachment or
enrolment procedure, the CTS\_RADIO\_LINK\_TIMEOUT shall be set to 64.

The CTS-MS shall continue transmitting as normal on the uplink until
S\_CTS reaches 0.

The algorithm shall start after the assignment of a dedicated channel
and S\_CTS shall be initialized to CTS\_RADIO\_LINK\_TIMEOUT.

The detailed operation shall be as follows:

\- the radio link time‑out algorithm shall be stopped at the reception
of a CTS intra-cell handover command;

\- (re‑)initialization and start of the algorithm shall be done whenever
the CTS-MS switches to a new timeslot, at the latest when the main
signalling link (see 3GPP TS 44.056) has been established;

\- the CTS\_RADIO\_LINK\_TIMEOUT value used at (re‑)initialization shall
be that used on the previous timeslot (in the CTS immediate assignment
case the value stored by the CTS-MS during the attachment procedure), or
the value received on SACCH if the CTS-MS has received a
CTS\_RADIO\_LINK\_TIMEOUT value on the new channel before the
initialization;

\- if the first CTS\_RADIO\_LINK\_TIMEOUT value on the SACCH is received
on the new channel after the initialization, the counter shall be
re‑initialized with the new value.

### 11.4.3 CTS-FP procedure

The criteria for determining radio link failure in the CTS-FP should be
based upon either the error rate on the uplink SACCH or on RXLEV/RXQUAL
measurements reported by the CTS-MS.

11.5 Radio link measurements
----------------------------

Radio link measurements are used in the intra-cell handover and RF power
control processes.

The measurements are made over each SACCH multiframe, which is 104 TDMA
frames (480 ms) for a TCH.

### 11.5.1 Signal strength

#### 11.5.1.1 General

The received signal level may be employed as a criterion in the RF power
control and intra-cell handover processes.

#### 11.5.1.2 Physical parameter

As specified in subclause 8.1.2, measured by the CTS-MS and CTS-FP.

#### 11.5.1.3 Statistical parameters

For each channel, the measured parameters (RXLEV) shall be the average
of the received signal level measurement samples in dBm taken on that
channel within the reporting period of length one SACCH multiframe
defined in 11.5.4. In averaging, measurements made during previous
reporting periods shall always be discarded.

When assigned a TCH, the CTS-MS shall make a received signal level
measurement on all bursts of the associated physical channel (see 3GPP
TS 45.002), including those of the SACCH.

For any TCH assigned to a CTS-MS, the CTS-FP shall make a received
signal level measurement on all bursts of the associated physical
channel including those of the SACCH.

#### 11.5.1.4 Range of parameter

As specified subclause in subclause 8.1.4.

### 11.5.2 Signal quality

#### 11.5.2.1 General

The received signal quality shall be employed as a criterion in the RF
power control and intra-cell handover processes.

#### 11.5.2.2 Physical parameter

As specified in subclause 8.2.2, measured by the CTS-MS and CTS-FP.

#### 11.5.2.3 Statistical parameters

For each channel, the measured parameters (RXQUAL) shall be the received
signal quality, averaged on that channel over the reporting period of
length one SACCH multiframe defined in subclause 11.5.4. In averaging,
measurements made during previous reporting periods shall always be
discarded.

#### 11.5.2.4 Range of parameter

As specified in subclause 8.2.4.

### 11.5.3 Aspects of discontinuous transmission (DTX)

The use of DTX is mandatory for the CTS-MS and the CTS-FP on a TCH. Not
all TDMA frames may be transmitted, however, the subset specified in
subclause 8.3 shall always be transmitted, and hence can be employed to
assess quality and signal level during DTX.

### 11.5.4 Measurement reporting for the CTS-MS on a TCH

For a TCH, the reporting period of length 104 TDMA frames (480 ms) is
defined in terms of TDMA frame numbers (FN) as follows:

  ---------------------- ----------------------------------- ---------------------
  Timeslot number (TN)   TDMA frame number (FN) modulo 104   
  TCH/F                  Reporting period                    SACCH Message block
  0 and 1                0 to 103                            12, 38, 64, 90
  2 and 3                26 to 25                            38, 64, 90, 12
  4 and 5                52 to 51                            64, 90, 12, 38
  6 and 7                78 to 77                            90, 12, 38, 64
  ---------------------- ----------------------------------- ---------------------

When on a TCH, the CTS-MS shall assess during the reporting period and
transmit to the CTS-FP in the next SACCH message block the following:

‑ CTS\_RXLEV\_FULL\_SERVING\_CELL and CTS\_RXQUAL\_FULL\_SERVING\_CELL
:\
RXLEV\_FULL and RXQUAL\_FULL for the full set of TCH and SACCH TDMA
frames. The full set of TDMA frames is 100 (i.e. 104 ‑ 4 idle) frames
for a full rate TCH;

‑ CTS\_RXLEV\_SUB\_SERVING\_CELL and CTS\_RXQUAL\_SUB\_SERVING\_CELL:\
RXLEV\_SUB and RXQUAL\_SUB for the subset of 4 SACCH frames and the SID
TDMA frames/L2 fill frames defined in 8.3. If no FACCH frames have been
received at the corresponding frame positions, the RXQUAL\_SUB report
shall include measurements on the 4 SACCH frames only. The performance
requirements of subclause 8.2.4 do not apply in this case for
RXQUAL\_SUB.

If the next SACCH message block is used for a different Layer 3 message,
the averaged data which would otherwise be sent in that block is
discarded and a new average started for the current block. i.e., any
SACCH message will report the average data for the previous reporting
period only.

The CTS-MS shall also transmit a bit (CTS\_DTX\_USED) in the next SACCH
message block, which indicates whether or not it has employed DTX during
the reporting period. This bit shall be set even if just one burst in a
TDMA frame in the reporting period was not transmitted due to DTX.

NOTE: A speech frame subject to DTX may cross the \"border\" between two
reporting periods, in which case both of the associated SACCH message
blocks will have the CTS\_DTX\_USED flag set.

11.6 Control of CTS-FP service range
------------------------------------

In order to restrict the CTS-FP service range, the CTS-FP shall monitor
the delay of the signal sent by from the CTS-MS. For each CTS-MS the
CTS-FP has allocated a TCH, a range measurement of the CTS-MS shall be
computed by the CTS-FP every five reporting period by averaging over
five reporting periods the assessed delay (as specified in 3GPP TS
45.010) for each received TCH burst of the subset always to be
transmitted, specified in subclause 8.3, and for each received SACCH
burst.

The TCH shall be released by the CTS-FP if two consecutive range
measurements are greater than 1 bit period.

11.7 Control parameters
-----------------------

The parameters employed to control the radio link are shown in table 4,
5 and 6.

12 COMPACT Mode Tasks
=====================

12.1 Introduction
-----------------

COMPACT is a radio interface mode for inter cell synchronized systems.
The mapping of control channels for up to four cells is done on the same
carrier and control channel separation is achieved by transmitting
control in different cells on different timeslots. The mapping of the
control channels is specified in 3GPP TS 45.002.

The COMPACT Mode Tasks defined in this clause applies for COMPACT
capable MSs in cells employing a CPBCCH carrier as defined in 3GPP
TS 45.002. The COMPACT Mode Tasks also applies for MSs in any cell,
where at least one CPBCCH is defined in a BA list.

Note: A mobile stations designed prior to release 99 will not find
CPBCCH carriers when it is looking for a BCCH carrier due to to the
different structure of synchronization and frequency bursts.

12.2 Network Pre-requisites
---------------------------

### 12.2.1 CPBCCH carriers

The CPBCCH carrier shall be transmitted with constant RF output power on
at least 4 radio blocks per multiframe on the serving time group (see
3GPP TS 45.002).

12.3 COMPACT Idle Mode Tasks
----------------------------

### 12.3.1 Introduction

Whilst in idle mode, a COMPACT capable MS shall implement cell selection
and cell reselection procedures as described in 3GPP TS 43.022. These
procedures make use of measurements and sub-procedures described in this
clause.

The procedures ensure that the MS is camped on a cell from which it can
reliably decode downlink data and with which it has a high probability
of communications on the uplink. Once the MS is camped on a cell, access
to the network is allowed.

The MS shall not use the discontinuous reception (DRX) mode of operation
(i.e., powering itself down when it is not expecting paging messages
from the network) while performing cell selection algorithms defined in
3GPP TS 43.022. However, use of powering down is permitted at all other
times in idle mode.

### 12.3.2 Measurements for COMPACT Cell Selection

An MS shall in the COMPACT Cell selection procedure search for CPBCCH
carriers. The MS shall search all RF channels in the system within its
band of operation, take readings of received RF signal level of each RF
channel, and calculate the RLA\_ P for each. Each reading of received RF
signal level shall be performed in such a way that it corresponds to the
RF level at occurrences when the potential CPBCCH carrier is
transmitting CPPCH, CSCH, CFCCH or CPBCCH blocks. Since the CPBCCH
carrier is discontinuous, a single random measurement will not suffice.
A single reading may instead consist of taking the maximum value out of
multiple measurements. The succeeding averaging is based on at least
five such measurement readings per RF carrier, where the readings are at
least 1 s apart. This procedure is referred to as a CPBCCH scan.

NOTE: It is allowed to only take readings of RF signal level of CPBCCH
carriers if identified.

CPBCCH carriers may be identified, for example, by searching for
frequency correction bursts and then synchronizing to and reading the
synchronization bursts at the prescribed offset from the PFCCH bursts
(see 3GPP TS 45.002). On finding a CPBCCH carrier, the MS shall attempt
to read the CPBCCH data, taking into account that the actual timeslot
allocation of the CPBCCH will change from multiframe to multiframe.

The maximum time allowed for synchronization to a CPBCCH carrier is 2.5
seconds. The maximum time allowed to read each system information
message, when being synchronized to the CPBCCH, is the time it takes to
complete a broadcast cycle of that message.

### 12.3.3 Measurements for COMPACT Stored List Cell Selection

The MS may include storage of CPBCCH carrier information when switched
off as detailed in 3GPP TS 43.022. The CPBCCH list may include CPBCCH
carriers from more than one band in a multi band operation PLMN. A MS
may also store CPBCCH carriers for more than one PLMN which it has
selected previously (e.g. at national borders or when more than one PLMN
serves a country), in which case the CPBCCH carrier lists must be kept
quite separate. The stored BCCH carrier information used by the MS may
be derived by a variety of different methods. As a minimum, the MS shall
store the last used HPLMN CPBCCH carriers. A memory shall host at least
the 24 last CPBCCH carriers from the HPLMN that the MS has camped on.

For a stored CPBCCH carrier list of the selected PLMN an MS shall
perform the same measurements as in subclause 12.3.2 except that only
the CPBCCH carriers in the list need to be measured.

NOTE: If the selected PLMN is equal to one of the equivalent PLMNs, then
stored list cell selection applies to all equivalent PLMNs.

If stored list cell selection is not successful, then as defined in 3GPP
TS 43.022, normal cell selection shall take place. Since information
concerning a number of channels is already known to the MS, it may
assign high priority to measurements on the strongest carriers from
which it has not previously made attempts to obtain CPBCCH information,
and omit repeated measurements on the known ones.

### 12.3.4 Criteria for COMPACT Cell Selection

The path loss criterion parameter C1 used for cell selection and
reselection  when in a COMPACT cell is defined by:

C1 = (A ‑ Max(B,0))

where

A = RLA\_P ‑ GPRS\_RXLEV\_ACCESS\_MIN\
B = GPRS\_MS\_TXPWR\_MAX\_CCH ‑ P

> GPRS\_RXLEV\_ACCESS\_MIN= Minimum received signal level at the MS
> required for access to the system.
>
> GPRS\_MS\_TXPWR\_MAX\_CCH= Maximum TX power level an MS may use when
> accessing the system until otherwise commanded.
>
> P= Maximum RF output power of the MS.

All values are expressed in dBm.

The path loss criterion (3GPP TS 43.022) is satisfied if C1 \> 0.

### 12.3.5 Downlink Signalling Failure

As defined for GPRS in subclause 6.5.

12.4 COMPACT Cell Reselection
-----------------------------

In GPRS Standby and Ready states (*A/Gb mode*) or RRC-Idle or
RRC-Connected mode (*Iu mode*), cell reselection is performed by the MS.
The cell reselection procedures defined in this subclause apply when an
MS is attached in a cell with a CPBCCH carrier or monitors a cell with a
CPBCCH (or both). Otherwise, the MS shall perform cell re-selection
according to subclause 10.1, or if PBCCH does not exist according to
subclause 6.6.

The cells to be monitored for cell re-selection, referred to as
neighbour cells, are defined in the BA(GPRS) list, which is broadcast on
PBCCH or CPBCCH. If PBCCH or CPBCCH does not exist, BA(GPRS) is equal to
BA(BCCH).

### 12.4.1 Monitoring the received signal level and CPBCCH data

The MS shall measure the received RF signal level on the CPBCCH or BCCH
carriers of the serving cell and the surrounding cells as indicated in
the BA(GPRS) list and optionally the NC\_FREQUENCY\_LIST, and calculate
the received level average (RLA\_P) for each carrier.

In addition the MS shall verify the BSIC of the neighbour cells. Only
cells with allowed BSIC shall be considered for re-selection. The
allowed BSIC is either a valid BSIC or, for cells in BA(BCCH) where no
BSIC is broadcast, a BSIC with allowed NCC part, (see subclause 7.2). A
valid BSIC is a BSIC broadcast for that carrier in the BA(GPRS) list.

#### 12.4.1.1 Packet idle mode or MAC-Idle state

Whilst in packet idle mode or MAC-Idle state an MS shall continuously
monitor all BCCH and CPBCCH carriers as indicated by the BA(GPRS) list
in the system information of the serving cell. Note that both BCCH and
CPBCCH carriers may be defined in the BA(GPRS) list. At least one
received signal level measurement sample on each neighbour cell shall be
taken for each paging block monitored by the MS according to its current
DRX mode and its paging group. As the minimum MS shall take one
measurement for each BCCH or CPBCCH carrier for every 4 second. As the
maximum, the MS is however not required to take more than 1 samples per
second for each neighbour cell. For CPBCCH carriers, only the TDMA
frames where common control or broadcast blocks are transmitted are used
for monitoring signal levels, see subclause 12.3.2.

RLA\_P shall be a running average determined using samples collected
over a period of 5 s to
Max {5s, five consecutive paging blocks of that MS}, and shall be
maintained for each BCCH or CPBCCH carrier. The same number of
measurement samples shall be taken for all neighbour cells, and the
samples allocated to each carrier shall as far as possible be uniformly
distributed over the evaluation period. At least 5 received signal level
measurement samples are required for a valid RLA\_P value.

The list of the 6 strongest non‑serving cells shall be updated at a rate
of at least once per running average period.

The MS shall attempt to check the BSIC for each of the 6 strongest
non‑serving cells at least every 14 consecutive paging blocks of that MS
or 10 seconds, whichever is greater. If a change of BSIC is detected
then the cell shall be treated as a new cell.

When requested by the user, the MS shall determine which PLMNs are
available as described in subclause 6.6.1. However, for MSs without DRX
or with short DRX period (see 3GPP TS 45.002), considerable
interruptions to the monitoring of PPCH can not be avoided.

#### 12.4.1.2 Packet transfer mode or MAC-Shared state

Whilst in packet transfer mode or MAC-Shared state a MS shall
continuously monitor all BCCH or CPBCCH carriers as indicated by the
BA(GPRS) list and the broadcast carrier of the serving cell. In every
TDMA frame possible, a received signal level measurement sample shall be
taken on at least one of the BCCH carriers or CPBCCH time groups, one
after another, as evenly distributed as possible among the neighbours.
As an exception for CPBCCH carriers on multislot allocations the MS
shall take at least 4 received signal level measurement samples for
CPBCCH carriers from two different time groups (2 samples/time group) in
every 52 multiframe, as evenly distributed as possible among the
neighbours. For CPBCCH carriers, only the TDMA frames where common
control or broadcast blocks are transmitted are used for monitoring
signal levels, see subclause 12.3.2.

RLA\_P shall be a running average determined using samples collected
over a period of 5 s, and shall be maintained for each BCCH and CPBCCH
carrier. The samples taken on each carrier shall as far as possible be
uniformly distributed over the evaluation period. At least 5 received
signal level measurement samples are required for a valid RLA\_P value.

The MS shall attempt to check the BSIC for as many non‑serving cells as
possible and as often as possible, and at least every 10 seconds. The MS
shall use TDMA frame 51 of the PDCH multiframe for checking BSICs of
CPBCCH carriers and TDMA frame 25 or 51 for checking BSIC of BCCH
carriers . These frames are termed search frames. A list containing BSIC
and timing information for these strongest carriers at the accuracy
required for accessing a cell (see 3GPP TS 45.010) including the
absolute times derived from the parameters T1, T2 T3 or R1, R2, TG shall
be kept by the MS. This information may be used to schedule the decoding
of BSIC and shall be used when re-selecting a new cell in order to keep
the switching time at a minimum. When a BCCH or CPBCCH carrier is found
to be no longer among the reported, BSIC and timing information shall be
retained for 10 seconds. (This is in case a cell re-selection command to
this cell is received just after the MS has stopped reporting that cell,
see subclause 10.1.4.2).

If, after averaging measurement results over 4 PDCH multiframes (1 sec),
the MS detects one or more BCCH or CPBCCH carrier, among the 6
strongest, whose BSICs are not currently being assessed, then the MS
shall as a matter of priority decode their BSICs.

The MS shall be able to send the first packet random access (PRACH) at
the latest 5+x seconds after a new strongest cell (which is part of the
BA(GPRS)) has been activated under the following network conditions:
Initial serving cell at RXLEV= -70 dBm, with 6 neighbours at RXLEV= -75
dBm. Then the new CPBCCH or BCCH carrier is switched on at RXLEV= -60
dBm. x is the longest time it may take to receive the necessary system
information on CPBCCH or BCCH in the new cell.

NOTE: Because of test equipment limitations it is acceptable to activate
the new carrier to replace one of the 6 neighbours.

In the case of a multiband MS, the MS shall attempt to decode the BSIC,
if any BCCH or CPBCCH carrier with unknown BSIC is detected among the
number of strongest CPBCCH carriers in each band as indicated by the
Multiband Reporting parameter (see subclause 8.4.3).

Thus an MS shall, for a period of up to 5 seconds, devote all search
frames to attempting to decode these BSICs. If this fails then the MS
shall return to confirming existing BSICs. Having re‑confirmed existing
BSICs, if there are still BCCH or CPBCCH carriers, among the six
strongest, with unknown BSICs, then the decoding of these shall again be
given priority for a further period of up to 5 seconds.

If either no BSIC can be decoded on a surrounding cells, or the BSIC is
not allowed, then the received signal level measurements on that channel
shall be discarded and the MS shall continue to monitor that channel.

If a change of BSIC is detected on a carrier, then any existing received
signal level measurement shall be discarded and the carrier shall be
treated as a new carrier.

If the BSIC cannot be decoded at the next available opportunities
re‑attempts shall be made to decode this BSIC. If the BSIC is not
decoded for more than three successive attempts it will be considered
lost and any existing received signal level measurement shall be
discarded and the MS shall continue to monitor that carrier.

### 12.4.2 COMPACT cell reselection criteria

The COMPACT GRPS mode cell reselection criteria follows the GPRS cell
reselection criteria described in subclause 10.1.2.

### 12.4.3 COMPACT cell reselection algorithm

The cell reselection algorithm for COMPACT follows the procedures
described for GPRS in subclause 10.1.3.

### 12.4.4 Network controlled Cell reselection

The network controlled cell reselection for COMPACT follows the
procedures described for GPRS in subclause 10.1.4.

### 12.4.5 COMPACT cell reselection measurement opportunities

COMPACT utilizes a timeslot mapping of control channel in a rotating
fashion as described in 45.002. With this timeslot rotation, a mobile
can make COMPACT neighbour cell measurements of all four time-groups.
The timeslot that an MS can use for measurements is dependent on the
timeslot number used for traffic. During one 52-multiframe, the MS is
able to measure one time-group on up to 4 frequencies once per control
block. During 1 s time period (4 multiframes), the MS is able to measure
all 4 time-groups .

The CPBCCH carrier shall be transmitted with constant RF output power as
defined in subclause 12.2.1, during a minimum number of control blocks.
The actual number of control blocks transmitted with constant RF output
power in a neighbour cell is indicated in the neighbour cell parameter
GUAR\_CONST\_PWR\_BLKS, broadcast in with the neighbour cell description
for an EGPRS neighbour cell.

######## Annex A (informative): Definition of a basic GSM or DCS 1 800 handover and RF power control algorithm

A.1 Scope
=========

This annex specifies a basic overall handover algorithm and RF power
control process that may be implemented in the GSM or DCS 1 800 system.

The specification includes a set of algorithms that are sufficient to
allow the successful implementation of an initial GSM or DCS 1 800
system, and from which more complex algorithms may be developed.

The basic solution is not mandatory for network operators.

A.2 Functional requirement
==========================

The present algorithm is based on the following assumptions:

‑ single cell BSS;

‑ the necessity to make a handover according to radio criteria is
recognized in the BSS. It can lead to either an (internal) intracell
handover or an intercell handover;

‑ evaluation of a preferred list of target cells is performed in the
BSS;

‑ cell allocation is done in the MSC;

‑ intracell handover for radio criteria (interference problems) may be
performed directly by the BSS;

‑ the necessity to make a handover because of traffic reason (network
directed handover) is recognized by the MSC and it is performed by
sending a \"handover candidate enquiry message\" to BSS;

‑ the RF power control algorithm shall be implemented in order to
optimize the RF power output from the MS (and BSS if power control is
implemented) ensuring at the same time that the signal level received at
the BSS (MS) is sufficient to keep adequate speech/data quality;

‑ all parameters controlling the handover and power control processes
shall be administered on a cell by cell basis by means of O&M. The
overall handover and power control process is split into the following
stages:

i\) BSS pre‑processing and threshold comparisons;

ii\) BSS decision algorithm;

iii\) MSC cell allocation algorithm.

A BSS decision algorithm is specified such that the BSS can fulfil the
mandatory requirement of being able to produce a preferred list of
target cells for handover.

It should be noted that since measurement results can also be sent to
the MSC in the \"handover required\" message, the handover decision
algorithm may be implemented in either the MSC or the BSS.

A.3 BSS pre-processing and threshold comparisons
================================================

For the purpose of handover and RF power control processing, the BSS
shall store the parameters and thresholds shown in table A.1. These
shall be administered on a cell by cell basis and downloaded to the BSS
by O&M procedures.

The parameters and thresholds related to the downlink power control
process are stored and used only if BSS RF power control is implemented.

The following measurements shall be continuously processed in the BSS:

i\) Measurements reported by MS on SACCH:

‑ Down link RXLEV;

‑ Down link RXQUAL;

‑ Down link surrounding cell RXLEV (RXLEV\_NCELL (n) on BCCH as
indicated in the BCCH Allocation).

ii\) Measurements performed in BTS:

‑ Uplink RXLEV;

‑ Uplink RXQUAL;

‑ MS‑BTS distance;

‑ Interference level in unassigned time slots.

Every SACCH multiframe (480 ms) a new processed value for each of the
measurements shall be calculated.

A.3.1 Measurement averaging process
-----------------------------------

The BSS shall be capable of pre‑processing the measurements by any of
the following processes:

‑ Unweighted average;

‑ Weighted average, with the weightings determined by O&M;

‑ Modified median calculation, with exceptionally high and low values
(outliers) removed before the median calculation.

The timing of the processing shall be controlled by parameters, set by
O&M, as follows:

a\) RXLEV\_XX (XX = DL or UL):

For every connection and for both links at least the last 32 samples
shall be stored (a sample is the value evaluated by the MS and BSS
during a period of 480 ms). Every 480 ms, with these samples, the BSS
shall evaluate the averaged value of the received power as defined by
the parameters Hreqave and Hreqt, applicable to RXLEV.

b\) RXLEV\_DL on BCCH carriers (RXLEV\_NCELL (n)):

For every connection and for each of up to 16 defined cells the BSS
shall store the values related to the last 32 samples. The BSS shall
average these samples as defined by the parameters Hreqave, Hreqt,
applicable to RXLEV.

c\) RXQUAL\_XX (XX = DL or UL):

For every connection and for both links at least 32 samples shall be
stored (a sample is the value calculated by the MS and BSS during period
of 480 ms). Every 480 ms, with these samples, the BSS shall evaluate the
received signal quality as defined by the parameters Hreqave and Hreqt,
applicable to RXQUAL.

d\) MS‑BTS distance:

For every connection the BSS shall average the adaptive frame alignment
value as defined by the parameters Hreqave and Hreqt, to derive an
estimate of the MS‑BTS distance.

e\) Interference level in unassigned time slots:

The BSS shall average the interference level in unassigned timeslots as
defined by the Intave parameter. The averaged results shall be mapped
into five interference categories (see 3GPP TS 48.008) whose limit O‑X5
are adjusted by O&M.

f\) Power Budget:

This assessment process may be employed by the network as a criterion in
the handover process, by setting a flag in the BSS by O&M command. If
the process is employed, every 480 ms, for every connection and for each
of allowable 32 adjacent cells, the BSS shall evaluate the following
expression:

PBGT(n) = (Min(MS\_TXPWR\_MAX,P) ‑ RXLEV\_DL ‑ PWR\_C\_D) ‑
(Min(MS\_TXPWR\_MAX(n),P) ‑ RXLEV\_NCELL(n))

Where the values of RXLEV\_NCELL(n) and RXLEV\_DL are obtained with the
averaging processes defined above. PWR\_C\_D is the difference between
the maximum downlink RF power permitted in the cell and the actual
downlink power due to the BSS power control. MS\_TXPWR\_MAX is the
maximum RF TX power an MS is permitted to use on a traffic channel in
the serving cell. MS\_TXPWR\_MAX (n) is the maximum RF TX power an MS is
permitted to use on a traffic channel in adjacent cell n. P is the
maximum TX power capability of the MS.

g\) Hreqave and Hreqt:

The values of Hreqt and Hreqave are defined by O&M for each cell for the
averaging of reported measurements. The values of Hreqave and Hreqt can
be different for each of the parameters being averaged.

Hreqave:

defines the period over which an average is produced, in terms of the
number of SACCH blocks containing measurement results, i.e. the number
of measurements contributing to each averaged measurement.

Hreqt:

is the number of averaged results that are maintained.

The BSS shall support values of Hreqave and Hreqt such that

0 \< Hreqav \< 32

and 0 \< Hreqt \< 32

where Hreqave \* Hreqt \< 32

A.3.2 Threshold comparison process
----------------------------------

### A.3.2.1 RF power control process

Every SACCH multiframe, the BSS shall compare each of the processed
measurements with the relevant thresholds. The threshold comparison
processes and the actions to be taken are as follows:

a\) Comparison of RXLEV\_XX with L\_RXLEV\_XX\_P (XX = DL or UL)

The algorithm shall be applied to the averaged RXLEV values (defined in
subclause A.3.1:a). The comparison process shall be defined by the
parameters P1 and N1 as follows:

‑ Increase XX\_TXPWR if at least P1 averages out of N1 averages are
lower than L\_RXLEV\_XX\_P. (e.g. P1 = 10 and N1 = 12)

b\) Comparison of RXLEV\_XX with U\_RXLEV\_XX\_P (XX = DL or UL)

The algorithm shall be applied to the averaged RXLEV values (defined in
subclause A.3.1:a). The comparison process shall be defined by the
parameters P2 and N2 as follows:

‑ Decrease XX\_TXPWR if at least P2 averages out of N2 averages are
greater than U\_RXLEV\_XX\_P. (e.g. P2 = 19 and N2 = 20)

c\) Comparison of RXQUAL\_XX with L\_RXQUAL\_XX\_P (XX = DL or UL)

The algorithm shall be applied to the averaged RXQUAL values (defined in
subclause A.3.1:c) The comparison process shall be defined by the
parameters P3 and N3 as follows:

‑ Increase XX\_TXPWR if at least P3 averaged values out of N3 averaged
values are greater (worse quality) than L\_RXQUAL\_XX\_P. (e.g. P3 = 5
and N3 = 7)

d\) Comparison of RXQUAL\_XX with U\_RXQUAL\_XX\_P (XX = DL or UL) The
algorithm shall be applied to the averaged RXQUAL values (defined in
subclause A.3.1:c) The comparison process shall be defined by the
parameters P4 and N4 as follows:

‑ Decrease XX\_TXPWR if at least P4 averaged values out of N4 averaged
values are lower (better quality) than U\_RXQUAL\_XX\_P. (e.g. P4 = 15,
N4 = 18)

### A.3.2.2 Handover Process

Every SACCH multiframe, the BSS shall compare each of the processed
measurements with the relevant thresholds. The threshold comparison
processes and the actions to be taken are as follows:

a\) Comparison of RXLEV\_XX with L\_RXLEV\_XX\_H (XX = DL or UL)

The algorithm shall be applied to the averaged RXLEV values (defined in
subclause A.3.1:a). The comparison process shall be defined by the
parameters P5 and N5 as follows:

‑ If at least P5 averaged values out of N5 averaged values are lower
than L\_RXLEV\_XX\_H a handover, cause XX\_RXLEV, might be required.
(e.g. P5 = 10 and N5 = 12).

b\) Comparison of RXQUAL\_XX with L\_RXQUAL\_XX\_H (XX = DL or UL)

The algorithm shall be applied to the averaged RXQUAL values (defined in
subclause A.3.1:c) The comparison process shall be defined by the
parameters P6 and N6 as follows:

‑ If at least P6 averaged values out of N6 averaged values are greater
(worse quality) than L\_RXQUAL\_XX\_H a handover, cause XX\_RXQUAL,
might be required. (e.g. P6 = 5 and N6 = 7).

c\) Comparison of RXLEV\_XX with RXLEV\_XX\_IH (XX= DL or UL)

The algorithm shall be applied to the averaged RXLEV values (defined in
subclause A.3.1:a). The comparison process shall be defined by the
parameters P7 and N7 as follows:

‑ If at least P7 averaged values out of N7 averaged values are greater
than RXLEV\_XX\_IH an internal handover might be required if RXQUAL\_XX
is also greater (worse quality) than L\_RXQUAL\_XX\_H (e.g. P7 = 10 and
N7 = 12).

d\) Comparison of MS‑BTS distance with the MAX\_MS\_RANGE

This comparison process may be employed by the network as a criterion in
the handover process by setting a flag in the BSS by O&M. If the process
is employed, the algorithm shall be applied to the averaged values
defined in subclause A.3.1:d. The comparison process shall be defined by
the parameters P8 and N8 as follows:

‑ If at least P8 averaged values out of N8 values are greater than
MS\_RANGE\_MAX a handover, cause DISTANCE, might be required. (e.g. P8 =
8 and N8 = 10).

e\) Comparison of PBGT(n) with the HO\_MARGIN(n)

If the process is employed, the action to be taken is as follows:

‑ If PBGT(n) \> O and PBGT(n) \> HO\_MARGIN(n) a handover, cause
PBGT(n), might be required.

This comparison enables handover to be performed to ensure that the MS
is always linked to the cell with the minimum path loss, even though the
quality and signal level thresholds may not have been exceeded.

A.4 BSS decision algorithm
==========================

Recognizing the necessity to request a handover the BSS shall send a
\"handover required message\" to the MSC containing the preferred list
of target cells.

The \"handover required message\" shall be also generated in answer to a
\"handover candidate enquiry message\" sent by the MSC.

The BSS decision algorithm shall be based on the following strategy:

RXLEV\_NCELL(n) \> RXLEV\_MIN(n) + Max (O, Pa) (A.1)

where: Pa = (MS\_TXPWR\_MAX(n)‑P)

(Min(MS\_TXPWR\_MAX,P) ‑ RXLEV\_DL ‑ PWR\_C\_D)
‑(Min(MS\_TXPWR\_MAX(n),P) ‑

RXLEV\_NCELL(n)) ‑ HO\_MARGIN(n) \> 0 (A.2)

All these expressions shall be evaluated using the averaged values
defined by the parameters Hreqt and Hreqave.

The BSS shall evaluate the equation (A.2) for each of the adjacent cells
that satisfies the expression (A.1) and shall compile the list of the
preferred adjacent cells ordinated depending on the value of equation
(A.2) (i.e. in the first position is the cell for which the value is the
maximum, in the second position is the cell with the second best value
and so on).

If there are any adjacent cells for which the values of RXLEV\_MIN(n),
HO\_MARGIN(n) and MS\_TXPWR\_MAX(n) are not known, i.e. the MS has
reported values from an undefined adjacent cell, then the default
parameters shall be used to evaluate equations 1 and 2, i.e.
RXLEV\_MIN\_DEF, HO\_MARGIN\_DEF, MS\_TXPWR\_MAX\_DEF. This enables
handover to occur in situations where a call is set up in unexpected
coverage area of a cell, without defined adjacent cells.

If there are several cells that satisfy the equation (A.2) with the same
results, the first cell in the list will be that one with the best
\"positive trend\". The trend shall be evaluated by the BSS using the
last Hreqt averaged values of RXLEV\_NCELL(n).

If the handover is considered imperative, that is one of the following
events is verified as the cause:

a\) the power level (UL and/or DL) is below the thresholds despite power
control (the MS or/and the BSS have reached the maximum allowed power);

b\) the quality of the link (UL and/or DL) is below the threshold while
at the same time the RXLEV approximates the threshold;

c\) the distance between MS and BTS exceeds the MAX\_MS\_RANGE.

The list of the preferred cells shall be compiled including any
candidates for which the result of the equation (A.2) is lower than 0.
Also in this case the list shall be compiled in a decreasing order of
priority.

A.4.1 Internal intracell handover according to radio criteria: (Interference problems)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The two conditions RXQUAL\_XX \> L\_RXQUAL\_XX\_H (bad quality) and
RXLEV\_XX \> RXLEV\_XX\_IH, if verified at the same time, indicate a
high probability of the presence of co‑channel interference.

This situation can be solved by changing the channel within the cell
with an intracell handover.

If internal intracell handover is supported by the BSS it shall be
performed as described in 3GPP TS 48.008.

If the BSS does not support internal intracell handover, then the
handover shall be initiated by sending a \"handover required message\"
to the MSC in which the serving cell is indicated as first priority.

A.4.2 Internal handover according to other criteria
---------------------------------------------------

Apart from radio criteria there are other criteria that may require
internal handover:

‑ O&M criteria;

‑ Resource management criteria.

In these cases, internal handover shall be triggered by the OMC or by
the resource management of the BSS.

A.4.3 General considerations
----------------------------

Since the RF power control process and the handover process are closely
linked, particular care shall be taken in order to avoid undesired
interactions between them.

In particular, the following interactions should be avoided, where
possible:

‑ a \"power increase command\" or a \"handover for RXLEV or for RXQUAL\"
subsequent to a \"power reduction command\" (e.g. by checking that the
averaged power level reduced by the Pow\_Red\_Step\_Size plus the
tolerances is greater than the L\_RXLEV\_XX\_P or L\_RXLEV\_XX\_H);

‑ a \"power reduction command\" subsequent to a \"power increase
command\".

After an action of power control the set of samples related to the
previous power level, in the corresponding link, shall not be used in
the processing.

If, during the decision process, the condition for the \"handover
required message\" is satisfied at the same time by different reasons.
The \"cause field\" in the \"handover required message\" sent to the
MSC, shall contain the reasons taking account of the following order of
priority:

‑ RXQUAL;

‑ RXLEV;

‑ DISTANCE;

‑ PBGT.

A.5 Channel allocation
======================

As described in 3GPP TS 48.008 the available channels shall be divided
into five interference categories whose limits O‑X5 are adjusted by O&M
command.

For handover, the channel allocated should be from the category with the
lowest interference level, since determination of the expected value of
C/I is not possible by the new BSS.

A.6 Handover decision algorithm in the MSC
==========================================

The MSC shall select the cell to which an MS is to be handed over by the
following criteria:

‑ Handover for radio criteria shall be handled taking into account the
following order of priority:

‑ RXQUAL;

‑ RXLEV;

‑ DISTANCE;

‑ PBGT.

e.g. if there are more handover bids to a cell than there are free
traffic channels, then the bids with cause \"RXQUAL\" shall take highest
priority.

‑ In order to avoid overload in the network, for every cell and with
reference to each of 16 adjacent cells, it shall be possible to define
(by O&M) for each adjacent cell one of at least 8 priority levels. These
shall be considered together with the list of candidates and the
interference levels in the choice of the new cell. For example, if there
are two cells which meet the criteria for handover, then the cell with
the highest priority shall be used. This enables umbrella cells, for
instance, to be given a lower priority, and only handle calls when no
other cell is available.

‑ Channel congestion on the best cell shall cause the choice of the
second best cell, if available, and so on. If no cell is found and call
queuing is employed in the MSC, then the MSC shall queue the request on
the best cell for a period equal to H\_INTERVAL (H\_INTERVAL \<
T\_Hand\_RQD shall be set by O&M). This handover shall have priority
over the queue handling new calls.

######## Annex B (informative): Power Control Procedures

Power control is important for spectrum efficiency as well as for power
consumption in a cellular system. For good spectrum efficiency quality
based power control is required. Power control for a packet oriented
connection is more complicated than for a circuit switched connection,
since there is no continuos two-way connection.

The power control formula for the MS is specified in subclause 10.2.1
(formula 1):

P = Γ~0~ - Γ~CH~ - α (C + 48) (all power calculations in dB)

This is a flexible tool that can be used for different power control
algorithms. (Note that the constants Γ~0~ and 48 are included only for
optimising the coding of Γ~CH~).For the BTS, there is no need to specify
any algorithm, but a similar formula can be used. The following are
examples of possible algorithms for uplink power control:

\- Open loop control.\
With this method the output power is based on the received signal level
assuming the same path loss in uplink and downlink. This is useful in
the beginning of a packet transmission.

\- Closed loop control.\
With this method the output power is commanded by the network based on
received signal level measurements made in the BTS in a similar way as
for a circuit switched connection.

\- Quality based control.\
This method can be used in combination with any of the two methods
above.

B.1 Open loop control
=====================

A pure open loop is achieved by setting α = 1 and keeping Γ~CH~
constant. The output power will than be:

P = Γ~0~ - Γ~CH~ - C - 48

The value Γ~CH~ can be calculated as follows to give a target value for
the received signal, SS~b~, at the BTS.

The received signal level at the MS:\
SS~m~ = P~BTS~ - P~b~ - L

where P~BTS~ = BTS maximum output power\
P~b~ = BTS power reduction due to power control\
L = path loss

The C value (normalised received signal level):\
C = SS~m~ + P~b~ = P~BTS~ - L

The MS output power: P = Γ~0~ - Γ~CH~ - C - 48 = Γ~0~ - Γ~CH~ - P~BTS~ +
L - 48

The received signal level at the BTS:\
SS~b~ = P - L = Γ~0~ - Γ~CH~ - P~BTS~ - 48

The constant value of Γ~CH~:\
Γ~CH~ = Γ~0~ - P~BTS~ - SS~b~ -48

B.2 Closed loop control
=======================

A pure closed loop is achieved by setting α = 0. The output power will
than be:

P = Γ~0~ - Γ~CH~

In this case, Γ~CH~ is the actual power level (relative to Γ~0~ )
commanded by network. It can be based on the received signal level
measured at the BTS. Power control commands can be sent when required in
order to achieve the target received signal level.

B.3 Quality based control.
==========================

In order to achieve the best performance the power control should be
quality based. The algorithm must also consider the path loss for
stability. The algorithm is not specified, it is the responsibility of
the manufacturer and/or the operator.

An example of a quality based power control algorithm is:

P~n+1~ = P~max~ - α ((C/I~n~ - C/I~min~) - (P~n~ - P~max~)) = P~ref~ - α
(C/I~n~ - P~n~)

where P is the output power from the MS.\
C/I is the received carrier to interference value at the BTS.\
P~max~ ,C/I~min~ and P~ref~ are reference values.\
α is a weighting factor.\
n is the iteration index.

In the closed loop case, this formula determines Γ~CH~:\
Γ~CH~ = Γ~0~ - P~n+1~ .

For the open loop case, we rewrite the formula. The carrier to
interference can be written:\
C/I = C~BTS~ - I~BTS~ = P - L - I~BTS~

where C~BTS~ is the received signal level at the BTS.\
I~BTS~ is the received interference level at the BTS.

thus P~n+1~ = P~ref~ - α (P~n~ - L~n~ - I~BTS,n~ - P~n~) = P~ref~ + α
(L~n~ + I~BTS,n~)

As shown above, the path loss is:\
L = P~BTS~ - C

The formula can therefore be written as (dropping the iteration index):

P = P~ref~ + α (P~BTS~ - C + I~BTS~) = Γ~0~ - Γ~CH~ - α (C - 48)

Thus, for the open loop case:\
Γ~CH~ = Γ~0~ - P~ref~ - α (P~BTS~ + I~BTS~ - 48)

The interference level I~BTS~ is measured in the BTS. The parameter
Γ~CH~ is estimated based on these measurements, considering the
appropriate weighting factor α, and the known parameters P~ref~ and
P~BTS~. The Γ~CH~ values are transferred to the MS in the Power Control
Parameters (see 3GPP TS 44.060).

B.4 BTS power control
=====================

The same algorithm as above can be used for downlink power control. The
formula for quality based control in the MS

P~n+1~ = P~ref~ + α (L~n~ + I~BTS,n~)

can be written for the BTS as:

Pd~n+1~ = P~ref~ + α (L~n~ + γ~CH,n~)

where Pd is the BTS output power (equal to P~BTS~ - P~b~).\
γ~CH~ is the received interference level at the MS.

Substituting the path loss and dropping the iteration index gives:\
P~d~ = P~ref~ + α (P~BTS~ - C + γ~CH~)

The received signal C and interference γ~CH~ is measured in the MS and
transferred to the BTS, which can calculate the output power.

B.5 Example
===========

Figure B.1 illustrates an example of the uplink power control function.

In packet idle mode or MAC-Idle state, the MS measures the C value on
each monitored PPCH block. Meanwhile, the BSS measures the interference
of the candidate PDCHs in order to have Γ~CH~ values ready for the first
transfer period. This is transferred to the MS in the Packet Uplink
Assignment.

In packet transfer mode or MAC-Shared state, the MS measures the C value
on the BCCH carrier and updates its output power. The BSS updates the MS
specific Γ~CH~ values and transfer them to the MS when needed, i.e. when
the interference level has changed.

Figure B.1: Traffic example of uplink power control

Figure B.2 illustrates an example of the downlink power control
function.

In packet idle mode or MAC-Idle state, the MS measures the C value on
each monitored PPCH block.

In packet transfer mode or MAC-Shared state, the MS measures the C value
on the BCCH carrier and the γ~CH~ values on all channels on the same
carrier as the assigned PDCH. These values are transferred to the BTS in
the Packet Downlink Ack/Nack messages. The BSS then updates the output
power.

The BTS may use the maximum power for the first transfer period and set
the polling for Ack/Nack as soon as possible to get the values measured
in packet idle mode or MAC-Idle state.

Figure B.2: Traffic example of downlink power control

B.6 Interworking between normal and fast power control for ECSD
===============================================================

Interworking between normal and fast power control in the ECSD mode is
done so that the normal power control may be running even if fast power
control is activated. This means that both the BSS and the MS shall, at
all times when in dedicated ECSD mode, estimate the radio link quality
plus send power level commands and link quality reports respectively
based on the cycle of the reporting period of length 104 TDMA frames (as
specified in subclause 8.4). When FPC is activated though, the power
level commands sent via SACCH are ignored by the MS.

Through this, a switch back to normal power control can be done very
easily since the MS always knows what power level to use immediately
after a switch. Switching between normal and fast power control always
takes place at the beginning of a reporting period.

The figure below illustrates the simultaneous operation of the two power
control mechanisms and their respective functional blocks.

![](media/image6.wmf){width="6.126388888888889in"
height="3.5069444444444446in"}

The BSC has the control over which power control loop is in use. This is
signalled with one control bit on the Abis interface to the BTS, which
in turn informs the MS, when the fast power control loop shall be used.
When FPC is not activated, there is no requirement for either the BTS
nor the MS to perform quality estimations or sending commands/reports
via E-IACCH.

The specific power control algorithm to be used for fast power control
is, as is the case for normal power control, implementation dependent
and is thus not standardised.

B.7 Interworking between normal and enhanced power control (EPC)
================================================================

Interworking between normal and enhanced power control (EPC) is done so
that the normal power control may be running even if enhanced power
control is activated. This means that both the BSS and the MS shall, at
all times when in EPC mode, estimate the radio link quality plus send
power level commands and link quality reports respectively based on the
cycle of the reporting period of length 104 TDMA frames (as specified in
subclause 8.4). When EPC in the uplink is activated though, the power
level commands sent via SACCH are ignored by the MS.

Switching between normal and enhanced power control always takes place
at the beginning of a (normal) reporting period.

The figure below illustrates the simultaneous operation of the two power
control mechanisms and their respective functional blocks.

The BSC has the control over which power control loop is in use. For the
uplink power control, this is signalled with one control bit on the Abis
interface to the BTS, which in turn informs the MS, when the enhanced
power control shall be used.

The specific power control algorithm to be used for enhanced power
control is, as is the case for normal power control, implementation
dependent and is thus not standardised.

######## Annex C (informative): Example Interference Measurement Algorithm

The following is an example algorithm for interference estimation at the
MS during the Training Sequence of a normal burst (GMSK or 8PSK). The
same technique may also be employed by the BTS.

The symbol spaced sampled complex envelope of the received signal
*r*(*t*), {*r~n~*}, can be expressed as follows:

Where {*c~i~*} represents the tap weights of the equivalent channel,
{*u~i~*} represents the complex symbols of the Training Sequence, *z~n~*
represents the interference and noise contribution, and *L1* and *L2*
are channel dispersion parameters.

STEP 1:

The channel is estimated using the first *N* symbols of the Training
Sequence (where *N* \< 26) as follows:

where $\overline{W}$represents the estimated equivalent channel
response.

$R = E\lbrack{\overline{u}}_{n}{\overline{u}}_{n^{H}}\rbrack$ is the *K*
x *K* correlation matrix of the complex symbols of Training Sequence
$\left\{ u_{n} \right\}$.

> $\overline{P} = E\lbrack{\overline{u}}_{n}r_{n^{}}\rbrack$ denotes the
> *K* x 1 cross-correlation vector between the complex symbols of
> Training Sequence and the received signal sample
> $\left\{ r_{n} \right\}$.

and
${\overline{u}}_{n} = \lbrack u_{n},u_{n - 1},\text{.}\text{.}\text{.},u_{n - K + 1}\rbrack^{T}$.

*K* will be decided based on the expected maximum equivalent channel
dispersion. Note that the equivalent channel corresponds to the combined
channel response of the physical channel and transmit and receive filter
responses. *K* represents the number of symbols over which the
equivalent channel dispersion is spanning. *K* = *L1*+*L2*+1.

STEP 2:

The interference and noise contribution (*IN*) is calculated for the
last *M* = 26-*N* symbols of the Training Sequence as follows:

Note that the accuracy of the interference estimate will improve as *M*
increases, on other hand the channel estimate may suffer because of a
reduced *N*. Optionally, the symbols in the immediate vicinity on either
side of the Training Sequence may also be used in estimating
interference.

STEP 3:

The above procedure may be performed in both the directions scanning
Training Sequence from left to right and right to left. By scanning in
both the directions, *IN* can be obtained for the first M symbols,
*IN1*, and for last M symbols, *IN2*. The interference measurement
sample SS~CH,n~ is calculated as follows.

SS~CH,n~ = (IN1+IN2)/2

######## Annex D (informative): Example Selection of Modulation and Coding Schemes based on Link Quality Reports 

The table below gives examples of Modulation and Coding Scheme (MCS)
selection based on the reported link quality estimates 8PSK\_MEAN\_BEP
and 8PSK\_CV\_BEP. The selection is designed to maximise the link
throughput. Further optimisation e.g. for the IR mode is possible. In
the same manner the MCS-1 to MCS-4 can be chosen based on
GMSK\_MEAN\_BEP and GMSK\_CV\_BEP and the Modulation and Coding Schemes
defined for EGPRS2 can be selected based on the defined modulation
specific measurements for MEAN\_BEP and CV\_BEP.
