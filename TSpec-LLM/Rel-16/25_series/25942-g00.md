4 General
=========

The present document discusses system scenarios for UTRA operation
primarily with respect to the radio transmission and reception. To
develop the UTRA standard, all the relevant scenarios need to be
considered for the various aspects of operation and the most critical
cases identified. The process may then be iterated to arrive at final
parameters that meet both service and implementation requirements.

Each scenario has four clauses:

a\) lists the system constraints such as the separation of the MS and
BTS, coupling loss;

b\) lists those parameters that are affected by the constraints;

c\) describes the methodology to adopt in studying the scenario;

d\) lists the inputs required to examine the implications of the
scenarios.

The following scenarios will be discussed for FDD and TDD modes (further
scenarios will be added as and when identified):

1\) Single MS, single BTS;

2\) MS to MS;

3\) MS to BS;

4\) BS to MS;

5\) BS to BS.

These scenarios will be considered for coordinated and uncoordinated
operation. Parameters possibly influenced by the scenarios are listed in
TS 25.101, TS 25.102, TS 25.104 and TS 25.105. These include, but are
not limited to:

\- out of band emissions;

\- spurious emissions;

\- intermodulation rejection;

\- intermodulation between MS;

\- reference interference level;

\- blocking.

The scenarios defined below are to be studied in order to define RF
parameters and to evaluate corresponding carrier spacing values for
various configurations. The following methodology should be used to
derive these results.

Define spectrum masks for UTRA MS and BS, with associated constraints on
PA.

Evaluate the ACP as a function of carrier spacing for each proposed
spectrum mask.

Evaluate system capacity loss as a function of ACP for various system
scenarios (need to agree on power control algorithm).

Establish the overall trade-off between carrier spacing and capacity
loss, including considerations on PA constraints if required. Conclude
on the optimal spectrum masks or eventually come back to the definition
of spectrum masks to achieve a better performance/cost trade-off.

NOTE: Existence of UEs of power class 1 with maximum output power
defined in TS 25.101 for FDD and in TS 25.102 for TDD should be taken
into account when worst case scenarios are studied.

Path loss is assumed to be free space i.e. 38,25 +20 log d (m) dB, where
d is the length of the sloping line connecting the transmit and receive
antennas.

Editor\'s note: This will be used to determine MCL.

4.2 Mobile Station to Mobile Station
------------------------------------

### 4.2.1 Near-far effect

**a) System constraints**

Dual mode operation of a terminal and hand-over between FDD and TDD are
not considered here, since the hand-over protocols are assumed to avoid
simultaneous transmission and reception in both modes.

The two mobile stations can potentially come very close to each other
(less than 1m). However, the probability for this to occur is very
limited and depends on deployment

![](media/image2.wmf){width="4.113194444444445in" height="1.95in"}

Figure 4.1: Possible MS to MS scenarios

NOTE: Both MS can operate in FDD or TDD mode.

**b) Affected parameters**

\[FDD and TDD\] MS Out-of-band emissions.

\[FDD and TDD\] MS Spurious emissions.

\[FDD and TDD\] MS Blocking.

\[FDD and TDD\] MS Reference interference level.

**c) Methodology**

The first approach is to calculate the minimum coupling loss between the
two mobiles, taking into account a minimum separation distance. It
requires to assume that the interfering mobile operates at maximum power
and that the victim mobile operates 3 dB above sensitivity.

Another approach is to take into account the deployment of mobile
stations in a dense environment, and to base the interference criterion
on:

\- the actual power received by the victim mobile station;

\- the actual power transmitted by the interfering mobile station,
depending on power control.

This approach gives as a result a probability of interference.

The second approach should be preferred, since the power control has a
major impact in this scenario.

**d) Inputs required**

For the first approach, a minimum distance separation and the
corresponding path loss is necessary. For the second approach, mobile
and base station densities, power control algorithm, and maximum
acceptable probability of interference are needed.

Minimum separation distance: 5 m\[ for outdoor, 1 m for indoor\].

Mobile station density: \[TBD in relation with service, cell radius and
system capacity\]

Base station density: \[cell radius equal to 4 km for rural, 0,5 km for
urban or 0,1 km for indoor\].

Power control algorithm: \[TBD\].

Maximum acceptable probability of interference: 2 %.

**e) scenarios for coexistence studies**

The most critical case occurs at the edge of FDD and TDD bands. Other
scenarios need to be considered for TDD operation in case different
networks are not synchronised or are operating with different frame
switching points.

FDD MS → TDD MS at 1 920 MHz (macro/micro, macro/pico).

TDD MS → FDD MS at 1 920 MHz (micro/micro, pico/pico).

TDD MS → TDD MS (micro/micro, pico/pico) for non synchronised networks.

These scenarios should be studied for the following services.

  ------------------- ----------------------------

### 4.2.2 Co-located MS and intermodulation

**a) System constraints**

Close mobile stations can produce intermodulation products, which can
fall into mobile or base stations receiver bands. This can occur with MS
operating in FDD and TDD modes, and the victim can be BS or MS operating
in both modes.

**b) Affected parameters**

\[FDD and TDD\] intermodulation between MS.

\[FDD and TDD\] MS and BS blocking.

\[FDD and TDD\] MS and BS reference interference level.

**c) Methodology**

The first approach is to assume that the two mobile stations are
collocated, and to derive the minimum coupling loss. It requires to
assume that both mobiles are transmitting at maximum power.

Another approach can take into account the probability that the two
mobiles come close to each other, in a dense environment, and to
calculate the probability that the intermodulation products interfere
with the receiver.

The second approach should be preferred.

**d) Inputs required**

Minimum separation distance: 5 m\[ for outdoor, 1 m for indoor\]

Mobile station density: \[TBD\]

Base station density: \[TBD in relation with MS density\]

Power control algorithm: \[TBD\]

Maximum acceptable probability of interference: 2 %

### 4.2.3 Estimated UE Out of Band Blocking

In some cases, it is possible to determine the expected out of band
blocking performance of the UE through the examination of simple
UE-to-UE interference scenarios. This is particularly true in the UE
transmit band where the performance of the duplexer in the receiver must
be sufficient to protect the UE from it's own transmitter as well as
from other nearby transmitters. During the development of the
specifications for Band I, this method was used to derive a value for
out of band blocking performance within the UE transmit band. However,
as additional frequency bands have been added to the UMTS specifications
the blocking values were specified to be similar to Band I but did not
accurately reflect the actual transmit/receive duplex spacing for the
additional bands.

For some bands it is assumed that only UMTS mobiles will be active in
the UE transmit band. However, for other bands (for example Band II and
Band V) other technologies may also be deployed and may be transmitting
near to the UE. In the analysis below it is assumed that the UMTS UE is
operating near its minimum sensitivity (i.e. \<REFSENS\> + 3 dB), the
mobiles are separated by 1m, and that the antenna gain is 0 dBi for each
device.

As an example, the impact to a UMTS UE receiver due to nearby GSM and
UMTS transmitters is calculated below:

Table 4.2A

  ----------------------------------------- --------- --------- ----------------
  Band II (1900 MHz)                        UMTS Tx   GSM Tx    Comment
  UE Max Transmit Power (a)                 24 dBm    30 dBm    
  Free Space Loss (b)                       38 dB     38 dB     1 meter
  Body Loss (total) (c)                     2 dB      2 dB      From Table 4.1
  Minimum Coupling Loss (MCL) (d)=(b)+(c)   40 dB     40 dB     
  Received Power Level (e)=(a)-(d)          -16 dBm   -10 dBm   
  ----------------------------------------- --------- --------- ----------------

In some cases, the body losses may be higher due to the close proximity
of the users head and also due to blockage of the hand on the UE. For
example, if body loss of 6 dB is included (3 dB per UE) then the
blocking requirements become -20 and -14 for UMTS and GSM interferers,
respectively. If body loss is increased to 12 dB (6 dB per UE) then the
blocking requirements become -26 and -20 dBm for UMTS and GSM
interferers, respectively. For data-only terminals there may be lower
losses as the body blockage would be reduced and the antenna gain may be
higher. Therefore, it is suggested to use -15 dBm as the UE receiver
blocking level in the UE transmit band, similar to Band I.

Similar results are shown below for Band V:

Table 4.2B

  ----------------------------------------- --------- -------- ----------------
  Band V (850 MHz)                          UMTS Tx   GSM Tx   Comment
  UE Max Transmit Power (a)                 24 dBm    33 dBm   
  Free Space Loss (b)                       31 dB     31 dB    1 meter
  Body Loss (c)                             2 dB      2 dB     From Table 4.1
  Minimum Coupling Loss (MCL) (d)=(b)+(c)   33 dB     33 dB    
  Received Power Level (e)=(a)-(d)          -9 dBm    0 dBm    
  ----------------------------------------- --------- -------- ----------------

As described above, the body losses may be higher in some cases. Also,
in general the body losses may be higher for frequencies below 1 GHz as
compared to the losses at 2 GHz. If body loss is increased to 6 dB (3 dB
per UE) then the blocking requirements become -13 and -4 for UMTS and
GSM interferers, respectively. If body loss is increased to 12 dB (6 dB
per UE) then the blocking requirements become -19 and -10 dBm for UMTS
and GSM interferers, respectively. Thus, for Band V it is suggested to
also use -15 dBm as the UE receiver blocking level in the UE transmit
band.

4.3 Mobile Station to Base Station
----------------------------------

**a) System constraints**

A mobile station, when far away from its base station, transmits at high
power. If it comes close to a receiving base station, interference can
occur.

The separation distance between the interfering mobile station and the
victim base station can be small, but not as small as between two mobile
stations.

Both the mobile and the base stations can operate in FDD and TDD modes,
thus four scenarios are to be considered, as shown in figure 4.3.

![](media/image4.wmf){width="4.113194444444445in"
height="2.1465277777777776in"}

Figure 4.3: Possible MS to BS scenarios

**b) Affected parameters**

\[FDD and TDD\] MS Out-of-band emissions.

\[FDD and TDD\] MS Spurious emissions.

\[FDD and TDD\] BS Blocking.

\[FDD and TDD\] BS Reference interference level.

**c) Methodology**

The first approach is to assume that the mobile station transmits at
maximum power, and to make calculations for a minimum distance
separation. This approach is particularly well suited for the blocking
phenomenon.

Another approach is to estimate the loss of uplink capacity at the level
of the victim base station, due to the interfering power level coming
from a distribution of interfering mobile stations. Those mobile
stations are power controlled. A hexagonal cell lay-out is considered
for the BS deployment with specified cell radius. Large cell radius are
chosen since they correspond to worst case scenarios for coexistence
studies.

The second approach should be preferred.

With both approaches two specific cases are to be considered.

Both base stations (BS~1~ and BS~2~) are co-located. This case occurs in
particular when the same operator operates both stations (or one station
with two carriers) on the same HCS layer.

The base stations are not co-located and uncoordinated. This case occurs
between two operators, or between two layers.

**d) Inputs required**

Minimum separation distance: \[30 m for rural, 15 m for urban, 3 m for
indoor\].

Base station density: \[cell radius equal to 4 km for rural/macro, 1,5
km for urban/macro, 0,5 km for urban/micro or 0,1 km for indoor/pico\].

Interfering mobile station density: \[TBD in relation with service, cell
radius and system capacity\].

Power control algorithm: \[TBD\].

Maximum acceptable loss of capacity: \[10 %\].

### 4.4.1 Near-far effect

A mobile station, when far away from its base station, receives at
minimum power. If it comes close to a transmitting base station,
interference can occur.

The separation distance between the interfering base station and the
victim mobile station can be small, but not as small as between two
mobile stations.

Both the mobile and the base stations can operate in FDD and TDD modes,
thus four scenarios are to be considered, as shown in figure 4.4.

stations in a dense environment, and to base the interference criterion
on the actual power received by the victim mobile station. This approach
gives a probability of interference. An hexagonal cell lay-out is
considered for the BS deployment with specified cell radius. Large cell
radius are chosen since they correspond to worst case scenarios for
coexistence studies.

The second approach should be preferred.

**d) Inputs required**

Minimum separation distance: \[30 m for rural, 15 m for urban, 3 m for
indoor\].

Base station density: \[cell radius equal to 4 km for rural/macro, 1,5
km for urban/macro, 0,5 km for urban/micro or 0,1 km for indoor/pico\].

Victim mobile station density: \[TBD in relation with service, cell
radius and system capacity\].

Downlink power control algorithm: \[TBD\].

Maximum acceptable probability of interference: 2 %.

### 4.4.2 Co-located Base Stations and intermodulation

**a) System constraints**

Co-located base stations can produce intermodulation products, which can
fall into mobile or base stations receiver bands. This can occur with BS
operating in FDD and TDD modes, and the victim can be BS or MS operating
in both modes.

**b) Affected parameters**

\[FDD and TDD\] intermodulation between BS.

\[FDD and TDD\] MS and BS blocking.

\[FDD and TDD\] MS and BS reference interference level.

**c) Methodology**

The first approach is to set a minimum separation distance between the
two interfering base stations and the victim.

Another approach can take into account the probability that the
intermodulation products interfere with the receiver, which does not
necessarily receive at a fixed minimum level.

The second approach should be preferred.

**d) Inputs required**

Minimum separation distance between the two BS and the victim: \[30 m
for rural, 15 m for urban, 3m for indoor\].

Mobile station density: \[TBD\].

Base station density: \[TBD in relation with MS density\].

Power control algorithm: \[TBD\].

Maximum acceptable probability of interference: 2 %.

4.5 Base Station to Base Station
--------------------------------

**a) System constraints**

Interference from one base station to another can occur when both are
co-sited, or when they are in close proximity with directional antenna.
De-coupling between the BS can be achieved by correct site engineering
on the same site, or by a large enough separation between two BS.

The base stations can operate either in FDD or TDD modes, as shown in
Figure 4.6, but the scenarios also apply to co-existence with other
systems.

![](media/image7.wmf){width="4.113194444444445in"
height="2.1680555555555556in"}

**b) Affected parameters**

\[FDD and TDD\] BS Out-of-band emissions.

\[FDD and TDD\] BS Spurious emissions.

\[FDD and TDD\] BS Blocking.

\[FDD and TDD\] BS Reference interference level.

**c) Methodology**

This scenario appears to be fixed, and the minimum coupling loss could
be here more appropriate than in other scenarios.

However, many factors are of statistical nature (number and position of
mobile stations, power control behaviour, path losses, \...) and a
probability of interference should here again be preferred.

**d) Inputs required**

Minimum coupling between two base stations, that are co-located or in
close proximity to each other: see sectin n Antenna to Antenna
Isolation.

Mobile station density: \[TBD in relation with service, cell radius and
system capacity\].

Base station density: \[cell radius equal to 4 km for rural/macro, 1,5
km for urban/macro, 0,5 km for urban/micro or 0,1 km for indoor/pico\].

Uplink and downlink power control algorithm: \[TBD\].

Maximum acceptable probability of interference: 2 %.

**e) scenarios for coexistence studies**

TDD BS → FDD BS at 1 920 MHz (macro/micro, macro/pico).

TDD BS → TDD BS (micro/micro, pico/pico) for non synchronised networks.

These scenarios should be studied for the following services.

5 Methodology for coexistence studies FDD/FDD
=============================================

5.1 ACIR
--------

### 5.1.1 Definitions

#### 5.1.1.1 Outage

For the purpose of the present document, an outage occurs when, due to a
limitation on the maximum TX power, the measured Eb/N0 of a connection
is lower than the Eb/N0 target.

#### 5.1.1.2 Satisfied user

A user is satisfied when the measured Eb/N0 of a connection at the end
of a snapshot is higher than a value equal to Eb/N0 target -0,5 dB.

#### 5.1.1.3 ACIR

The Adjacent Channel Interference Power Ratio (ACIR) is defined as the
ratio of the total power transmitted from a source (base station or UE)
to the total interference power affecting a victim receiver, resulting
from both transmitter and receiver imperfections.

### 5.1.2 Introduction

In the past, (see reference /1, 2, 3/) different simulators were
presented with the purpose to provide capacity results to evaluate the
ACIR requirements for UE and BS; in each of them similar approach to
simulations are taken.

In the present document a common simulation approach agreed in WG4 is
then presented, in order to evaluate ACIR requirements for FDD to FDD
coexistence analysis.

#### 5.1.2.1 Overview of the simulation principles

Simulations are based on snapshots were users are randomly placed in a
predefined deployment scenario; in each snapshot a power control loop is
simulated until Eb/N0 target is reached; a simulation is made of several
snapshots.

The measured Eb/N0 is obtained by the measured C/I multiplied by the
Processing gain

UE\'s not able to reach the Eb/N0 target *at the end* of a PC loop are
in outage; users able to reach at least (Eb/N0 ‑0,5 dB) at the end of a
PC loop are considered satisfied; statistical data related to outage
(satisfied users) are collected at the end of each snapshot.

Soft handover is modeled allowing a maximum of 2 BTS in the active set;
the window size of the candidate set is equal to 3 dB, and the cells in
the active set are chosen randomly from the candidate set; selection
combining is used in the Uplink and Maximum Ratio Combining in DL.

Uplink and Downlink are simulated independently.

### 5.1.3 Simulated scenarios in the FDD - FDD coexistence scenario

Different environments are considered: macro-cellular and micro-cellular
environment.

Two coexistence cases are defined: macro to macro multi-operator case
and macro to micro case.

#### 5.1.3.1 Macro to macro multi-operator case

##### 5.1.3.1.1 Single operator layout

Base stations are placed on a hexagonal grid with distance of 1 000
meters; the cell radius is then equal to 577 meters.

Base stations with Omni-directional antennas are placed in the middle of
the cell.

The number of cells for each operator in the macro-cellular environment
should be equal or higher than 19; 19 is considered a suitable number of
cells when wrap around technique is used.

![](media/image8.wmf){width="3.2152777777777777in"
height="2.1152777777777776in"}

Figure 4.7: Macro-cellular deployment

##### 5.1.3.1.2 Multi-operator layout 

In the multi-operator case, two base stations shifting of two operators
are considered:

\- (worst case scenario): 577 m base station shift;

\- (intermediate case): 577/2 m base station shift selected.

The best case scenario (0 m shifting = co-located sites) is NOT
considered.

#### 5.1.3.2 Macro to micro multi-operator case

##### 5.1.3.2.1 Single operator layout, microcell layer

Microcell deployment is a Manhattan deployment scenario.

Micro cell base stations are placed to Manhattan grid, so that base
stations are placed to street crossings as proposed in /6/. Base
stations are placed every second junction, see Figure 4.8.This is not a
very intelligent network planning, but then sufficient amount of inter
cell interference is generated with reasonable low number of micro cell
base stations.

The parameters of the micro cells are the following:

\- block size = 75 m;

\- road width = 15 m;

\- intersite distance between line of sight = 180 m.

The number of micro cells in the micro-cellular scenario is 72.

![](media/image9.wmf){width="2.495138888888889in"
height="2.701388888888889in"}

Figure 4.8: Microcell deployment

##### 5.1.3.2.2 Multi-operator layout 

The microcell layout is as it was proposed earlier (72 BSs in every
second street junction, block size 75 meters, road width 15 meters);
macro cell radius is 577 meters (distance between BSs is 1 000 meter).

Cellular layout for HCS simulations is as shown in figure 4.9. This
layout is selected in order to have large enough macro cells and low
amount number of microcells so that computation times remain reasonable.
Further, macro cell base station positions are selected so that as many
conditions as possible can be studied (i.e. border conditions etc.), and
handovers can always be done.

When interference is measured at macro cell base stations in uplink,
same channel interference is measured **only** from those users
connected to the observed base station. The measured same channel
interference is then multiplied by 1/F. F is the ratio of intra-cell
interference to total interference i.e.:

F = I~intra~(*i*)/( I~intra~(*i*) + I~inter~(*i*))

F is dependant on the assumed propagation model, however, several
theoretical studies performed in the past have indicated that a typical
value is around 0.6. An appropriate value for F can also be derived from
specific macrocell-only simulations. Interference from micro cells to
macro cell is measured by using wrap-around technique. Interference that
a macro cell base station receives is then:

I = ACIR\* I~micro~ + (1/F) \*I~macro~,

where ACIR is the adjacent channel interference rejection ratio, and
I~macro~ is same channel interference measured from users connected to
the base station.

When interference is measured in downlink, same channel and adjacent
channel interference is measured from all base stations. When
interference from micro cells is measured wrap-around technique is used.

When interference is measured at micro cells in uplink and downlink,
same channel and adjacent channel interference is measured from all base
stations. When same channel interference is measured wrap-around is
used.

When simulation results are measured all micro cell users and those
macro cell users that are area covered by micro cells are considered. It
is also needed to plot figures depicting position of bad quality calls,
in order to see how they are distributed in the network. In addition,
noise rise should be measured at every base station and from that data a
probability density function should be generated.

![](media/image10.wmf){width="3.025in" height="4.622916666666667in"}

Figure 4.9: Macro-to micro deployment

#### 5.1.3.3 Services simulated

The following services are considered:

\- speech 8 kbps;

\- data 144 kbps.

Speech and data services are simulated in separate simulations, i.e. no
traffic mix is simulated.

### 5.1.4 Description of the propagation models

Two propagation environments are considered in the ACIR analysis:
macro-cellular and micro-cellular.

For each environment a propagation model is used to evaluate the
propagation path loss due to the distance; propagation models are
adopted from /5/ and presented in the following clauses for macro and
micro cell environments.

#### 5.1.4.1 Received signal

An important parameter to be defined is minimum coupling loss (MCL),
i.e.: what is the minimum loss in signal due to fact that the base
stations are always placed much higher than the UE(s).

Minimum Coupling Loss (MCL) is defined as the minimum distance loss
including antenna gain measured between antenna connectors; the
following values are assumed for MCL:

\- 70 dB for the Macro-cellular environment;

\- 53 dB for the Microcell environment.

With the above definition, the received power in Down or Uplink can be
expressed for the macro environment as:

RX\_PWR = TX\_PWR - Max (pathloss\_macro - G\_Tx - G\_RX, MCL)

and for the micro as:

RX\_PWR = TX\_PWR - Max(pathloss\_micro - G\_Tx - G\_RX , MCL)

where:

\- RX\_PWR is the received signal power;

\- TX\_PWR is the transmitted signal power;

\- G\_Tx is the Tx antenna gain;

\- G\_RX is the Rx antenna gain.

Within simulations it is assumed 11 dB antenna gain (including cable
losses) in base station and 0 dB in UE.

#### 5.1.4.2 Macro cell propagation model

Macro cell propagation model is applicable for the test scenarios in
urban and suburban areas outside the high rise core where the buildings
are of nearly uniform height /5/.

L= 40(1-4x10-3Dhb) Log10(R) -18Log10(Dhb) + 21Log10(f) + 80 dB.

Where:

\- R is the base station - UE separation in kilometers;

\- f is the carrier frequency of 2 000 MHz;

\- Dhb is the base station antenna height, in meters, measured from the
average rooftop level.

The base station antenna height is fixed at 15 meters above the average
rooftop (Dhb = 15 m). Considering a carrier frequency of 2000 MHz and a
base station antenna height of 15 meters, the formula becomes:

L = 128.1 + 37.6 Log10(R)

After L is calculated, log-normally distributed shadowing (LogF) with
standard deviation of 10 dB should be added, so that the resulting
pathloss is the following:

Pathloss\_macro = L + LogF

NOTE 1: L shall in no circumstances be less than free space loss. This
model is valid for NLOS case only and describes worse case propagation.

NOTE 2: The path loss model is valid for a range of Dhb from 0 to 50
meters.

NOTE 3: This model is designed mainly for distance from few hundred
meters to kilometers, and there are not very accurate for short
distances.

#### 5.1.4.3 Micro cell propagation model

Also the micro cell propagation model is adopted form /5/. This model is
to be used for spectrum efficiency evaluations in urban environments
modelled through a Manhattan-like structure, in order to properly
evaluate the performance in microcell situations that will be common in
European cities at the time of UMTS deployment.

The proposed model is a recursive model that calculates the path loss as
a sum of LOS and NLOS segments. The shortest path along streets between
the BS and the UE has to be found within the Manhattan environment.

The path loss in dB is given by the well-known formula:

$L = \text{20} \cdot \text{log}_{\text{10}}\frac{4\text{πd}_{n}}{\lambda}$

Where:

\- dn is the \"illusory\" distance;

\- l is the wavelength;

\- n is the number of straight street segments between BS and UE (along
the shortest path).

The illusory distance is the sum of these street segments and can be
obtained by recursively using the expressions
$k_{n} = k_{n - 1} + d_{n - 1} \cdot c$ and
$d_{n} = k_{n} \cdot s_{n - 1} + d_{n - 1}$ where c is a function of the
angle of the street crossing. For a 90° street crossing the value c
should be set to 0,5. Further, sn-1 is the length in meters of the last
segment. A segment is a straight path. The initial values are set
according to: k0 is set to 1 and d0 is set to 0. The illusory distance
is obtained as the final dn when the last segment has been added.

The model is extended to cover the micro cell dual slope behavior, by
modifying the expression to:

$L = \text{20} \cdot \text{log}_{\text{10}}(\frac{4\text{πd}_{n}}{\lambda} \cdot D(\sum_{j = 1}^{n}s_{j - 1}))$.

Where:

$D(x) = \left\{ \begin{matrix}
\frac{x}{x_{\text{br}}},x > x_{\text{br}} \\
1,x \leq x_{\text{br}} \\
\end{matrix} \right.\ $.

Before the break point xbr the slope is 2, after the break point it
increases to 4. The break point xbr is set to 300 m. x is the distance
from the transmitter to the receiver.

To take into account effects of propagation going above rooftops it is
also needed to calculate the pathloss according to the shortest
geographical distance. This is done by using the commonly known COST
Walfish-Ikegami Model and with antennas below rooftops:

L = 24 + 45 log (d+20).

Where:

\- d is the shortest physical geographical distance from the transmitter
to the receiver in metros.

The final pathloss value is the minimum between the path loss value from
the propagation through the streets and the path loss based on the
shortest geographical distance, plus the log-normally distributed
shadowing (LogF) with standard deviation of 10 dB should be added:

Pathloss\_micro = min (Manhattan pathloss, macro path loss) + LogF.

NOTE: This pathloss model is valid for microcell coverage only with
antenna located below rooftop. In case the urban structure would be
covered by macrocells, the former pathloss model should be used.

### 5.1.5 Simulation description

Uplink and Downlink are simulated independently, i.e. one link only is
considered in a single simulation.

A simulation consists of several simulation steps (snapshot) with the
purpose to cover a large amount of all the possible UE placement in the
network; in each simulation step, a single placement (amongst all the
possible configuration) of the UEs in the network is considered.

#### 5.1.5.1 Single step (snapshot) description

A simulation step (snapshot) constitutes of mobile placement, pathloss
calculations, handover, power control and statistics collecting.

In particular:

\- at the beginning of each simulation step, the UE(s) are distributed
randomly across the network, according to a uniform distribution;

\- for each UE, the operator ( **in case of macro to macro simulation**)
is selected randomly, so that the number of users per base stations is
the same for both operators;

\- after the placement, the pathloss between each UE and base station is
calculated, adding the lognormal fading, and stored to a so-called
G-matrix (Gain matrix).

Distance attenuation and lognormal fading are kept constant during the
execution of a snapshot.

\- Based on the Gain Matrix, the active base stations (transmitting base
stations) are selected for each UE based on the **handover algorithm**.

\- Then a stabilization period (**power control loop**) is started;
during stabilization power control is executed so long that the used
powers reach the level required for the required quality.

During the power control loop, the Gain Matrix remain constant.

\- A sufficient number of power control commands in each power control
loop is supposed to be higher than 150.

\- At the end of a power control loop, statistical data are collected;
UEs whose quality is below the target are considered to be in outage;
UEs whose quality is higher the target -0,5 dB are considered to be
satisfied.

#### 5.1.5.2 Multiple steps (snapshots) execution

When a single step (snapshot) is finished, UE(s) are re-located to the
system and the above processes are executed again. During a simulation,
as many simulation steps (snapshots) are executed as required in order
to achieve sufficient amount of local-mean-SIR values.

For 8 kbps speech service, a sufficient amount of snapshots is supposed
to be 10 000 values or more; for data service, a higher number of
snapshot is required, and a sufficient amount of snapshots is supposed
to be 10 times the value used of 8 kbps speech.

As many local-mean-SIR values are obtained during one simulation step
(snapshot) as UE(s) in the simulation. Outputs from a simulation are
SIR-distribution, outage probability, capacity figures etc.

### 5.1.6 Handover and Power Control modelling

#### 5.1.6.1 Handover Modelling

The handover model is a non-ideal soft handover. Active set for the UE
is selected from a pool of base stations that are candidates for
handover. The candidate set is composed from base stations whose
pathloss is within handover margin, i.e.: base stations whose received
pilot is stronger than the received pilot of the strongest base station
subtracted by the handover margin.

A soft hand-over margin of 3 dB is assumed.

The active set of base stations is selected randomly from the candidate
base stations; a single UE may be connected to maximum of 2 base
stations simultaneously.

##### 5.1.6.1.1 Uplink Combining

In the uplink, selection combining among active base stations is
performed so that the frame with highest average SIR is used for
statistics collecting purposes, while the other frames are discarded.

##### 5.1.6.1.2 Downlink Combining

In the downlink, macro diversity is modelled so that signal received
from active base stations is summed together; maximal ratio combining is
realized by summing measured SIR values together:

$\text{SIR} = \frac{C_{1}}{I_{1} + N} + \frac{C_{2}}{I_{2} + N}$.

#### 5.1.6.2 Power Control modelling of traffic channels in Uplink

Power control is a simple SIR based fast inner loop power control.

Perfect power control is assumed, i.e.: during the power control loop
each UE perfectly achieve the Eb/N0 target, assuming that the maximum TX
power is not exceeded; with the assumption of perfect power control, PC
error is assumed equal to 0 %, and PC delay is assumed to be 0 s.

UEs not able to achieve the Eb/N0 target at the end of a power control
loop are considered in outage.

Initial TX power for the PC loop of UL Traffic Channel is based on path
loss, thermal noise and 6 dB noise rise; however, the initial TX power
should not affect the convergence process (PC loop) to the target Eb/N0.

##### 5.1.6.2.1 Simulation parameters

*UE Max TX power:*

The maximum UE TX power is 21 dBm (both for speech and data), and UE
power control range is 65 dBm; the minimum TX power is therefore -44
dBm.

*Uplink Eb/N0 target (form RTT submission);*

\- macro-cellular environment: speech 6,1 dB, data 3,1 dB;

\- micro-cellular environment: speech 3,3 dB, data 2,4 dB.

##### 5.1.6.2.2 SIR calculation in Uplink

Local-mean SIR is calculated by dividing the received signal by the
interference, and multiplying by the processing gain. Signals from the
other users are summed together and seen as interference.
Signal-to-interference-ratio will be:

$\text{SIR}_{\text{UL}} = \frac{G_{P} \cdot S}{(1 - \beta) \cdot I_{\text{OWN}} + I_{\text{OTHER}} + N_{0}}$

Where S is the received signal, Gp is processing gain, Iown is
interference generated by those users that are connected to the same
base station that the observed user, Iother is interference from other
cells, No is thermal noise and β is an interference reduction factor due
to the use of, for example, Multi User Detection (MUD) in UL.

MUD is NOT included in these simulations, therefore β = 0.

Thermal noise is calculated for 4.096 MHz band by assuming 5 dB system
noise figure. Thermal noise power is then equal to -103 dBm.

In the multi-operator case, Iother also includes the interference coming
from the adjacent operator; the interference coming from the operator
operating on the adjacent is decreased by ACIR dB.

##### 5.1.6.2.3 Admission Control Modelling in Uplink

Admission control is not included in this kind of simulation.

#### 5.1.6.3 Power Control modelling of traffic channels in Downlink

Power control is a simple SIR based fast inner loop power control.

Perfect power control is assumed, i.e.: during the power control loop
each DL traffic channel perfectly achieve the Eb/N0 target, assuming
that the maximum TX power is not exceeded; with the assumption of
perfect power control, PC error is assumed equal to 0 %, and PC delay is
assumed to be 0 s.

UEs whose DL traffic channel is not able to achieve the Eb/N0 target at
the end of a power control loop are considered in outage.

Initial TX power for the PC loop of DL Traffic Channel is chosen
randomly in the TX power range; however, the initial TX power should not
affect the convergence process (PC loop) to the target Eb/N0.

##### 5.1.6.3.1 Simulation parameters

*Traffic channel TX power:*

Working assumption for DL traffic channel power control range is 25 dBm,
and the maximum power for each DL traffic channel is (both for speech
and data) the following:

\- Macro-cellular environment: 30 dBm;

\- Micro-cellular environment: 20 dBm.

Downlink Eb/N0 target (from RTT submission):

\- macro-cellular environment: speech 7,9 dB, data 2,5 dB with DL TX or
RX diversity, 4,5 dB without diversity;

\- micro-cellular environment: speech 6,1 dB, data 1,9 dB with DL TX or
RX diversity.

##### 5.1.6.3.2 SIR calculation in Downlink

Signal-to-interference-ratio in Downlink can be expressed as:

$\text{SIR}_{\text{DL}} = \frac{G_{P} \cdot S}{\alpha \cdot I_{\text{OWN}} + I_{\text{OTHER}} + N_{0}}$

Where S is the received signal, Gp is processing gain, Iown is
interference generated by those users that are connected to the same
base station that the observed user, Iother is interference from other
cells, α is the orthogonality factor and No is thermal noise. Thermal
noise is calculated for 4.096 MHz band by assuming 9 dB system noise
figure. Thermal noise power is then equal to -99 dBm.

Iown includes also interference caused by perch channel and common
channels.

Transmission powers for them are in total:

\- macrocells: 30 dBm;

\- microcells: 20 dBm.

The orthogonality factor takes into account the fact that the downlink
is not perfectly orthogonal due to multipath propagation; an
orthogonality factor of 0 corresponds to perfectly orthogonal intra-cell
users while with the value of 1 the intra-cell interference has the same
effect as inter-cell interference.

Assumed values for the orthogonality factor alpha are /1:

\- macrocells: 0,4;

\- microcells: 0,06.

In the multi-operator case Iother also includes the interference coming
from the adjacent operator; the interference coming from the operator
operating on the adjacent is decreases by ACIR dB.

##### 5.1.6.3.3 Admission Control Modelling in Downlink

Admission control is not included in this kind of simulation.

##### 5.1.6.3.4 Handling of Downlink maximum TX power

During WG4\#2 the issue of DL BS TX power limitation was addressed,
i.e.: the case when the sum of all DL traffic channels in a cell exceeds
the maximum base station TX power.

The maximum base station TX power are the following:

\- macrocells: 43 dBm;

\- microcells: 33 dBm.

If in the PC loop of each snapshot the overall TX power of each BS is
higher than the Maximum Power allowed, at a minimum for each simulation
statistical data related to this event have to be collected to validate
the results; based on these results, in the future a different approach
could be used for DL.

The mechanism used to maintain the output level of the base station
equal or below the maximum is quite similar to an analogue mechanism to
protect the power amplifier.

At each iteration, the mobiles request more or less power, depending on
their C/I values. A given base station will be requested to transmit the
common channels and the sum of the TCHs for all the mobiles it is in
communication with.

If this total output power exceeds the maximum allowed for the PA, an
attenuation is applied in order to set the output power of the base
station equal to its maximum level. In a similar way that an RF variable
attenuator would operate, this attenuation is applied on the output
signal with the exception of common channels, i.e. all the TCHs are
reduced by this amount of attenuation.

The power of the TCH for a given mobile will be:

TCH(n+1) = TCH(n) +/- Step - RF\_Attenuation.

### 5.1.7 System Loading and simulation output

#### 5.1.7.1 Uplink

##### 5.1.7.1.1 Single operator loading

The number of users in the uplink in the single operator case is defined
as N\_UL\_single.

It is evaluated according to a 6 dB noise rise over the thermal noise in
the UL (6 dB noise rise is equivalent to 75 % of the Pole capacity of a
CDMA system):

\- a simulation is run with a predefined number of users, and at the end
the average noise rise (over the thermal noise) is measured; if lower
than 6 dB, the number of users is increased until the 6 dB noise rise is
reached;

\- the number of users corresponding to a 6 dB noise rise is here
defined as *N\_UL\_single*.

##### 5.1.7.1.2 multi-operator case (macro to macro)

The number of users in the uplink in the multi-operator case is defined
as N\_UL\_multi:

\- it is evaluated, as in the single case, according to a 6 dB noise
rise over the thermal noise in the UL; a simulation is run with a
predefined number of users, and at the end the average noise rise (over
the thermal noise) is measured; if lower than 6 dB, the number of users
is increased until the 6 dB noise rise is reached;

\- the number of users corresponding to a 6 dB noise rise is here
defined as *N\_UL\_multi*.

For a given value of ACIR, the obtained N\_UL\_multi is compared to
N\_UL\_single to evaluate the capacity loss due to the presence of a
second operator.

##### 5.1.7.1.3 multi-operator case (macro to micro)

It is very likely that noise rise does not change with the same amount
for micro and macro cell layers if number of users is changed in the
system. It is proposed that loading is selected with the following
procedure.

Two different numbers of input users are included in the simulator:

\- N\_users\_UL\_macro;

\- N\_users\_UL\_micro:

0\) an ACIR value is selected;

1\) start a simulation (made of several snapshots) with an arbitrary
number of N\_users\_UL\_micro and N\_users\_UL\_macro;

2\) measure the system loading;

3\) run another simulation (made of several snapshots) by increasing the
number of users (i.e.: N\_users\_UL\_macro or micro) in the cell layer
having lower noise rise than the layer-specific tthreshold, and
decreasing number of users ((i.e. N\_users\_UL\_micro or macro) in the
cell layer in which noise rise is higher than the layer-specific
threshold etc. etc.;

4\) redo phases 1 and 2 until noise rise is equal to the specific
threshold for both layers;

5\) when each layer reaches in average the noise rise threshold, the
input values of N\_UL\_users\_UL\_macro and micro are taken as an output
and compared to the valuse obtained in the single operator case for the
ACIR value chosen at step 0.

Two Options (Option A and Option B) are investigated in relation with
the noise rise threshold:

Option A:

\- the noise rise threshold for the macro layer is equal to 6 dB whilst
the threshold for the microlayer is set to 20 dB. The noise rise is
combination of interfernce coming from the micro and the macro cell
layers. Micro and macro cell layers are interacting, i.e. micro cell
interference affects to macro cell layer and viceversa.

Option B:

\- the noise rise threshold is set to 6dB for both the macro and the
micro layer, but the microcells are de-sensitized of 14 dB.

#### 5.1.7.2 Downlink

##### 5.1.7.2.1 Single operator loading

The number of users in the downlink for the single operator case is
defined as N\_DL\_single.

Downlink simulations are done so that single operator network is loaded
so that 95 % of the users achieve an Eb/No of at least (target Eb/No
-0,5 dB) (i.e.: 95 % of users are satisfied) and supported number of
users N\_DL\_single is then measured.\".

##### 5.1.7.2.2 multi-operator case (macro to macro)

In the multi operator case the networks is loaded so that 95 % of users
are satisfied and the obtained number of user is defined as
N\_DL\_multi.

For a given value of ACIR, the measured N\_DL\_multi is obtained and
compared to the N\_DL\_single obtained in the single operator case.

##### 5.1.7.2.3 Multi-operator case (Macro to Micro)

Similar reasoning to the UL case is applied.

#### 5.1.7.3 Simulation output

The following output should be produced:

\- capacity figures (N\_UL and N\_DL);

\- DL and UL capacity vs ACIR in the multi-operator case (see Figure 5.1
for the macro to macro case);

\- outage (non-satisfied users) distributions.

### 5.1.9 Simulation Parameters for 24 dBm terminals

#### 5.1.9.1 Uplink

The only difference in respect with the parameters listed in the

as well);

5.2 BTS Receiver Blocking
-------------------------

The simulations are static Monte Carlo using a methodology consistent
with that described in the clause on ACIR.

The simulations are constructed using two uncoordinated networks that
are on different frequencies. The frequencies are assumed to be
separated by 10 MHz to 15 MHz or more so that the BS receiver
selectivity will not limit the simulation, and so that the UE spurious
and noise performance will dominate over its adjacent channel
performance. These are factors that distinguish a blocking situation
from an adjacent channel situation in which significant BS receiver
degradation can be caused at very low levels due to the poor ACP from
the UE.

During each trial of the simulations, uniform drops of the UE are made,
power levels are adapted, and data is recorded. A thousand such trials
are made. From these results, CDF of the total signal appearing at the
receivers\' inputs have been constructed and are shown in the graphs
inserted in the result clause.

### 5.2.1 Assumptions for simulation scenario for 1 Km cell radius

The primary assumptions made during the simulations are:

1\) both networks are operated with the average number of users (50)
that provide a 6 dB noise rise;

2\) the two networks have maximal geographic offset (a worst case
condition);

3\) cell radius is 1 km;

4\) maximum UE power is 21 dBm;

5\) UE spurious and noise in a 4,1 MHz bandwidth is 46 dB;

6\) BS selectivity is 100 dB (to remove its effect);

7\) C/I requirement is --21 dB;

8\) BS antenna gain is 11 dB;

9\) UE antenna gain is 0 dB; and

10\) minimum path loss is 70 dB excluding antenna gains.

### 5.2.2 Assumptions for simulation scenario for 5 Km cell radius

The primary assumptions that are common to all simulations are:

1\) the two networks have maximal geographic offset (a worst case
condition);

2\) cell radius is 5 km;

3\) UE spurious and noise in a channel bandwidth is 46 dB;

4\) BS selectivity is 100 dB (to remove its effect);

5\) BS antenna gain is 11 dB;

6\) UE antenna gain is 0 dB;

7\) minimum path loss is 70 dB including antenna gains. In addition;

8\) for the speech simulations, maximum UE power is 21 dBm and the C/I
requirement is --21 dB;

9\) for the data simulations, maximum UE power is 33 dBm and the C/I
requirement is --11,4 dB.

NOTE: This is different from the basic assumption in the ACIR clause,
since its data power level is 21 dBm, just like the speech level.

### 5.2.3 Assumptions for macro-micro simulation scenario with 1 and 2 Km interfering macro cell radius

The primary assumptions that are common to all simulations are:

1\) the topology of the multi-operator Macro-Micro scenario as in clause
5.1.3.2. Finite micro cell layer (Manhattan grid) overlaid by a much
larger finite macro network (see Figure 5.2).

2\) interfering macro cell radius is 1 or 2 km;

3\) noise floor at BS receiver is --103 dBm for macro and --93 dBm for
micro;

4\) log-normal shadow fading standard deviation is 10 dB;

5\) BS antenna gain is 11 dB;

6\) UE antenna gain is 0 dB;

7\) MCL is 70 dB for Macro and 53 dB for Micro (including antenna
gains);

8\) for the speech simulations, maximum UE power is 21 dBm and the micro
cell C/I requirement is --23.5 dB;

9\) for the data simulations, maximum UE power is 33 dBm and the micro
C/I requirement is --12 dB.

NOTE: This is different from the basic assumption in the ACIR clause,
since its data power level is 21 dBm, just like the speech level.

1km interfering macro cell size)

### 5.2.4 Assumptions for micro-micro simulation scenario 

The layout for a single Micro network is described in chapter 5.1.3.2.
Based on this network grid, a second identical Micro network grid was
placed in the same area but with maximal geographic offset between the
Micro BSs as worst-case condition (see Figure 5.3). The number of BS in
this scenario is 72 Micro BS (network 1) plus 72 Micro BS (network 2).
This approach is consistent with the strategy used in chapter 5.2 (BTS
receiver blocking) in case of two Macro networks.

Simulation parameters are as under 5.2.2.

6 Methodology for coexistence studies FDD/TDD
=============================================

6.1 Evaluation of FDD/TDD interference
--------------------------------------

\[Editor\'s note: a better description of the parameters used to
simulate the services is needed. Eb/N0 values for FDD and TDD to be
specified in detail like in the FDD/FDD clause.\]

### 6.1.1 Simulation description

The implementation method is not exactly the same as in \[12\].

Different main parameters, which are independent of the simulated
environment, are as follows, and are assumed for both TDD and FDD mode.

\- Application of a fixed carrier spacing of 5 MHz in all cases.

\- Spectrum masks for BS and MS.

\- Maximum transmit powers for BS and MS.

\- Receiver filters for BS and MS.

\- Power Control.

#### 6.1.1.1 Simulated services

Concerning a service assumption all stations have used speech service.

#### 6.1.1.2 Spectrum mask

WG4 agreed a definition to characterise the power leakage into adjacent
channels caused mainly due to transmitter non-linearities. The agreed
definition is:

\- **Adjacent Channel Leakage power Ratio (ACLR):** The ratio of the
transmitted power to the power measured after a receiver filter in the
adjacent RF channel. Both the transmitted power and the received power
are measured within a filter response that is nominally rectangular,
with a noise power bandwidth equal to the chip rate.

Following the above definition, the ACLR for the spectrum masks for BS
and MS are given in table 6.1.

  ------------------- --------- ---------- ------- ---------- ------- ---------- ------- ------- -------

#### 6.1.1.3 Maximum transmit power

The maximum transmit powers for BS and MS are given in table 6.2.

The figures are defined according to the three environments assuming
that a speech user occupies one slot and one code in TDD and one frame
and one code in FDD.

Table 6.2: Maximum transmit power used in the simulations

  ---------------- ------- -------- -------- -------- --------

                   BS      27 dBm   20 dBm   20 dBm   27 dBm
  ---------------- ------- -------- -------- -------- --------

#### 6.1.1.4 Receiver filter

On the receiver side, in the first step an ideal RRC filter (α = 0,22)
has been implemented and in the second step a real filter has been
implemented.

WG4 agreed on an Adjacent Channel Selectivity (ACS) definition as
follows:

\- **Adjacent Channel Selectivity (ACS):** Adjacent Channel Selectivity
is a measure of a receiver\'s ability to receive a signal at its
assigned channel frequency in the presence of a modulated signal in the
adjacent channel. ACS is the ratio of the receiver filter attenuation on
the assigned channel frequency to the receiver filter attenuation on the
adjacent channel frequency. The attenuation of the filter on the
assigned and adjacent channels is measured with a filter response that
is nominally rectangular, with a noise power bandwidth equal to the chip
rate.

Following the above definition, the ACS becomes infinity with the ideal
RRC filter. The ACS with the real filter are given in table 6.3.

Table 6.3: ACS used in the simulations

  ---- --------------------------
       ACS with the real filter
  MS   32 dB
  BS   45 dB
  ---- --------------------------

#### 6.1.1.5 Power control

Simulations with and without power control (PC) have been done.

In the first step a simple C based power control algorithm has been
used. The PC algorithm controls the transmit power in the way to achieve
sensitivity level at the receiver.

In the second step a C/I based power control algorithm has been used.

The model for power control uses the Carrier to Interferer (C/I) ratio
at the receiver as well as the receiving information power level as
shown in figure 6.1.

![](media/image14.png){width="2.4166666666666665in"
height="2.4166666666666665in"}

Figure 6.1: C/I based Power Control algorithm

The model considers the interference caused by alien systems as well as
the intra-system interference. The control algorithm compares the C/I
value at the receiver with the minimum required and the maximum allowed
C/I value. In order to keep the received C/I in its fixed boundaries the
transmission power is controlled (if possible). Consequently the most
important value during power control is the C/I. If the C/I is in the
required scope, the transmission power is varied to keep the received
power in its fixed boundaries, too. Figure 6.2 shows an example of the
power algorithm. The axis of ordinate contains the C/I threshold and the
axis of abscissa contains the C-thresholds.

![](media/image15.png){width="4.322222222222222in"
height="3.2805555555555554in"}

Figure 6.2: Example of power algorithm

The two straight lines include all possible values for C/I(C) for a
received interference power I\_1 and I\_2. The area defined by the
thresholds is marked with grey. The control of the corresponding
station\'s transmission power should get the point on the straight line
into the marked area. Regarding the interference I\_1, the transmission
power must pulled up until the minimum receiving power is reached. The
upper C/I threshold demand cannot be fulfilled here. Concerning I\_2,
the grey marked area can be reached.

Figure 6.3: Power control in UL

![](media/image17.png){width="1.9375in" height="1.6875in"}

Figure 6.4: Power control in DL

It has to be remarked that the power control strategy in CDMA systems is
different for uplink and downlink. In the uplink, each mobile has to be
controlled in the way that the base station receives as low as possible
power while keeping C/I requirements. Therefore the pathloss for each
connection has to be considered. Concerning the downlink, the base
station transmits every code with the same power regardless of the
different coeval active connections. Consequently the power control must
consider the mobile with the lowest receiving power level to ensure a
working connection for each mobile.

The power control range is assumed as given in table 6.4.

The power control step size is 1 dB for both MS and BS.

### 6.1.2 Macro Cell scenario

#### 6.1.2.1 Evaluation method

Since for the macro scenario a hexagonal cell structure is assumed, a
Monte-Carlo method has been chosen for evaluation. Each Monte-Carlo (MC)
calculation cycle starts with the positioning of the receiver station
(disturbed system) by means of an appropriate distribution function for
the user path. The interfering (mobile) stations are assumed to be
uniformly distributed. The density of interferers is taken as parameter.
To start up we assume that only the closest user of the co-existing
interfering system is substance of the main interference power. However
to judge the impact of more than the one strongest interferer, some
simulation cases are performed with the 5 strongest interferer stations.
In simulations behind it was shown that taking into account more than 5
will not change the simulation results. In addition a transmitter
station in the disturbed system and a receiver station in the
interfering system are placed, i.e.: communication links in both systems
are set up. At each MC cycle the pathloss between the disturbed receiver
and the next interfering station as well as the pathloss for the
communication links are determined according to the pathloss formula
given in the next clause. Depending on the use of power control the
received signal level C at the receiver station in the disturbed system
is calculated. Finally the interference power I is computed taking into
account the transmit spectrum mask and the receiver filter. C/I is then
substance to the staistical evaluation giving the CDF.

#### 6.1.2.2 Pathloss formula

The pathloss formula for the **Macro Vehicular Environment Deployment
Model** is implemented to simulate the MS ↔ BS case (10 dB log-normal
standard deviation, see annex B, clause B.1.6.4.3 in \[9\]). Both 2 000
m and 500 m cell-radii are considered. The simulation does not support
sectorised antenna patterns so an omnidirectional pattern is used.

However \[9\] was generated before the evaluation phase of different
concepts for UTRA, which were all FDD based systems. Therefore \[9\]
does not name propagation models for all possible interference
situations. E.g. considering TDD the mobile to mobile interference
requires a model valid for transmitter and receiver antennas having the
same height. In order to cover this case the outdoor macro model in
\[18\] was used. The model is based on path loss formula from H. Xia
considering that the height of the BS antenna is below the average
building height. This is seen as reasonable approximation of the
scenario. Furthermore it has to be considered that mobiles might be very
close to each other, i.e. in LOS condition, which leads to considerably
lower path loss. To take this effect into account LOS and NLOS is
randomly chosen within a distance of 50 m (100 m) for MS - MS (BS - MS)
interference whereas the probability for LOS increases with decreasing
distance. Details can be found in \[18\].

#### 6.1.2.3 User density

The user density of the TDD system is based on the assumption that 8
slots are allocated to DL and UL, respectively. Considering 8 or 12
codes per slot this yields 64 / 96 channels per carrier corresponding to
53,4 / 84,1 Erlang (2 % blocking). Taking into account that users are
active within only one slot and that DTX is implemented we reach
effective user densities of 5,14/km² / 8,10/km² for the 500 m cell
radius (cell area = 0,649 km²) and 0,32/km² / 0,51/km² for the 2 000 m
cell radius (cell area = 10,39 km²), respectively. Note that these
figures \"sound\" rather small, since we concentrate on one slot on one
carrier. However if an average traffic of 15 mE per user is assumed,
these figures lead to 5 484 real users per km² / 8 636 real users per
km². It should be emphasised that this investigations regards user on a
single carrier at adjacent frequencies, since users on the second
adjacent frequency will be protected by higher ACP figures. In addition
one TDD carrier per operator is a very likely scenario at least in the
first UMTS start-up phase.

The user density of the FDD system is based on the ITU simulation
results given in \[16\]. For the macro environment 88 Erlang per carrier
lead to an effective user density of 4,23/km² and 67,7/km² for the 200 m
cell and 500 m cell respectively. Note that in FDD all users are active
during the entire frame.

### 6.1.3 Micro cell scenario

#### 6.1.3.1 Evaluation method

For the **Micro Pedestrian Deployment Model**, a Manhattan-grid like
scenario has been generated. A 3x3 km² area with rectangular street
layout is used. The streets are 30 m wide and each block is 200 m in
length. This is in accordance to annex B, clause B.1.6.4.2 in \[9\].

In the microcellular environment evaluation a detailed event-driven
simulation tool is used. A street-net is loaded into the simulator
(according to \[9\]). A given number of mobiles is randomly distributed
over the street-net with a randomly chosen direction. These mobiles move
with a maximum speed of 5 km/h along the streets. If they come to a
crossing there is a probability of 0,5 for going straight across the
crossing and a probability of 0,25 for turning left and right
respectively. If there is another mobile in the way, a mobile slows down
to avoid a collision. This results in a distribution of the speed that
comes close to the one described in \[9\]. Mobiles coming from the right
may cross a crossing first. The model simulates the behaviour of cars
and pedestrians in a typical Manhattan-grid layout. Based on the
observed coupling loss the received signal C and the interference power
I are determined in the same way as described for the macro scenario.

#### 6.1.3.2 Pathloss formula

Using the propagation model presented in \[17\] by J.E.Berg, only one
corner is considered, i.e. propagation along more than one corner
results in an attenuation above 150 dB and is therefore negligible. The
log normal standard deviation used is 10 dB.

#### 6.1.3.3 User density

Starting again from 64 and 96 users per slot for TDD, we reach an
effective user density of 129,36 per km² and 203,73 per km²,
respectively (e.g. 64 users → 53,4 Erlang → 6,675 Erlang per slot →
258,72 Erlang per km² (cell area = 0,0258 km², due to 72 BSs covering
the streets) → 129,36 effective users (DTX) ). Assuming on average 25 mE
per user this will lead us to 82 791 and 130 388 users per km², which
might be slightly too high in a real scenario. For that reason
simulation cases for 10 000, 5 000 and 1 000 user per km² are added.

### 6.1.4 Pico cell scenario

#### 6.1.4.1 Evaluation method

The third scenario studied is the **Indoor Office Test Environment
Deployment Model**. This scenario is referenced as the
**Pico**-scenario. It is implemented as described in annex B, clause
B.1.6.4.1 of \[9\]. The office rooms give in principle a cell structure
similar to the macro environment case, because only one floor without
corridors is implemented. For that reason the evaluation method used is
the same as in macro based on Monte-Carlo simulations.

#### 6.1.4.2 Pathloss formula

The indoor path loss formula given in \[9\] was implemented (log-normal
standard deviation 12 dB). However it is taken care that the coupling
loss is not less than 38 dB, which corresponds to a 1m free-space loss
distance.

#### 6.1.4.3 User density

Some reasonable assumptions have been made on the user density in the
pico cell scenario. If we take straight forward the ITU simulation
results based on \[9\] e.g. for FDD, we reach 220 000 active users per
km² (88 Erlang per BS, BS serves two rooms, i.e. 2 × 10 m × 10 m =
0,0002 km² with DTX = 0,5 → 220 000 active users per km²). Assuming
further on average 300mE per user, there should be 29.333.333 users per
km², which is not very realistic. For the simulations we added a 10 000
active users per km² case in FDD.

Starting from a realistic scenario we assumed that each user in a room
occupies 10 m² yielding 10 user per room or 100 000 user/km². For TDD we
get 100 000 / 8 × 0,5 (DTX) = 6 250 users per slot, which leads under
the assumption of 100 mE per user to 625 active users per km². This is
the lowest user density referred to in the simulation results clause. To
judge the impact on the results the user density is increased up to
almost 10 000 active users per km².

### 6.1.5 HCS scenario

The scenario is a multi-operator layout with a microcell TDD and a
macrocell FDD system. The microcell layout has 20 × 20 Blocks of 75 m
width separated by streets with 15m width. In an evaluation area of 12 ×
12 blocks in the middle of the manhattan grid 72 BSs are placed in every
second street junction. The FDD macrocells are placed with a distance of
1 000 m. Antenna hights are 10 m for TDD and 27 m for FDD BSs (see
figure 6.5).

Figure 6.5: Multi-operator HCS scenario

The evaluation of interference has been done by Monte Carlo simulations
where mobiles have been placed randomly on the streets and connected to
their best serving BS. The user density in the FDD system has been 44
transmitting users per cell. All mobiles have been power controlled
depending on the actual receive power and on the actual interference
situation which in the case of a victim station consisted of a randomly
chosen co-channel interference and the calculated adjacent channel,
inter-system interference. In each snapshot, the adjacent channel
interference power of the 30 strongest interferers has been summed up
and evaluated.

6.2 Evaluation of FDD/TDD interference yielding relative capacity loss
----------------------------------------------------------------------

### 6.2.1 Definition of system capacity

The capacity of the system is defined as the mean number of mobile
stations per cell that can be active at a time while the probability
that the C/I falls below a given threshold is below 5 %. All mobiles use
the same service. This definition is different but strongly related to
the so-called \"satisfied user criterion\", i.e. 98 % of all users have
to be able to complete their call without being dropped due to
interference. However the \"satisfied user criterion\" requires the
mapping of C/I to BER/BLER values and time-continuous simulation
techniques, while in \[19\] a Monte Carlo snap shot method is used.
Please note that the definition incorporates the term \"mean number of
mobile stations\". This mean that the load in different cells may be
different while the mean load, i.e. the total number of users in the
simulated scenario, remains constant during the simulation.

### 6.2.2 Calculation of capacity

A relative capacity loss is calculated as:

$C = 1 - \frac{N_{\text{multi}}}{N_{\text{sin}\text{gle}}}$,

where N~single~ is the maximum mean number of mobiles per cell that can
be active at a time in the single operator case, i.e. without adjacent
channel interference. N~multi~ is the maximum mean number of mobiles per
cell that cn be active at a time in the multi operator case, i.e. with
adjacent channel interference originating in one interfering system in
an adjacent transmit band.

#### 6.2.2.1 Calculation of single operator capacity

Following the definition of capacity in 2.1, the percentage of users
with a C/I below the given threshold has to be calculated. Since C/I is
a random value, the simulation can lead to the cumulative distribution
function:

$F_{\frac{C}{I},N_{\text{sin}\text{gle}}} = P\left( \text{cir} < \text{CIR},N_{\text{sin}\text{gle}} \right)$.

The objective of the simulation is to find the number N~single~ that
fulfils the relation:

$P\left( \text{cir} < \text{threshold},N_{\text{sin}\text{gle}} \right) \leq 5\text{\%}$.

N~single~ is determined as follows:

1\) calibrate the co-channel interference;

2\) place mobiles;

3\) calculate best server;

4\) control power;

5\) calculate co-channel interference at perturbed station;

6\) do power control for perturbed station;

7\) Evaluate C/I;

8\) remove all stations and continue with 2. Until a number of trials is
reached;

9\) calculate the CDF of C/I;

10\) increase or decrease the number N~single~ and start again as long
as the given outage probability is reached.

The co-channel interference power depends on a number of parameters,
especially on the number of mobiles, their position and their power
control behaviour. The co-channel interference power can be approximated
by a normal distribution as long as the number of sources is large and
as long as those sources are independent from each other. Although the
sources are not totally independent, the co-channel interference coming
from outside the simulated scenario is modelled by a normal
distribution. For all cells having a complete set of co-channel cells in
the simulated scenario, the co-channel interference is calculated
exactly after power control in all co-channel cells.

The mean and the variance of the random co-channel interference is
calculated with the following algorithm:

\- calculate the statistic of co-channel interference in the victim
cell;

\- assume the same mean and variance to be valid for other cells;

\- calculate the statistic again and repeat until the parameters of the
co-channel interference distribution do not change any longer.

#### 6.2.2.2 Calculation of multi operator capacity

Again following the definition of capacity in 2.1, the percentage of
users with a C/I below the given threshold has to be calculated. Since
C/I is a random value for each fixed N~multi~ the simulation can lead to
a number of cumulative distribution functions:

$F_{\frac{C}{I},N_{\text{multi}},N_{\text{other}}} = P\left( \text{cir} < \text{CIR},N_{\text{multi}},N_{\text{other}} \right)$.

N~other~ is the mean number of active mobiles per cell in the adjacent
interfering system. The objective of the simulation is to find the
number N~multi~ that fulfils the relation:

$P\left( \text{cir} < \text{threshold},N_{\text{multi}},N_{\text{other}} \right) \leq 5\text{\%}$

for a fixed number of N~other~.

The procedure to determine N~multi~ is done similar as described in
2.2.1:

1\) calibrate the co-channel interference in the victim system;

2\) place mobiles in victim and interfering system;

3\) calculate best server in victim and interfering system;

4\) control power in bothsystems;

5\) calculate co-channel interference at perturbed station;

6\) calculate adjacent interference at perturbed station;

7\) do power control for perturbed station;

8\) evaluate C/I;

9\) remove all stations and continue with 2. Until a number of trials is
reached;

10\) calculate the CDF of C/I;

11\) increase or decrease the number N~multi~ and start again as long as
the given outage probability is reached.

7 Methodology for coexistence studies TDD/TDD
=============================================

7.1 Introduction
----------------

\- Two different approaches to study the TDD/TDD coexistence are
described in the following clauses:Evaluation of the interference, as
done in the FDD/TDD case.

\- ACIR approach, similar to the FDD/FDD case.

7.2 Evaluation of the TDD/TDD interference
------------------------------------------

The eveluation method is the same as used in the corresponding clause of
the FDD/TDD coexistence study.

7.3 Evaluation of TDD/TDD interference yielding relative capacity loss
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The evaluation method is the same as used in the corresponding clause of
the FDD/TDD coexistence study yielding relative capacity loss (see
clause 6.2).

7.4 ACIR
--------

### 7.4.1 Macro to Macro multi-operator case

The relationship between ACIR and system capacity loss has been studied
for speech service in a TDD system consisting of two operators with
synchronised switching points (clause 7.3.1.1). This means that the two
operators are, at the same time, both in uplink or in downlink. In that
case uplink and downlink were studied separately.

A different set of simulations (clause 7.3.1.2) has been carried out
supposing switching point synchronisation inside each operator and
complete switching point asynchronisation between different operators.
This means that all the cells controlled by the same operator have the
same direction and that there is a complete overlapping between the
uplink of the first operator and the downlink of the second one. Aim of
this clause is to analyse capacity figures obtained by means of
simulations performed for different ACIR values in this scenario.

#### 7.4.1.1 Synchronised operators

The simulations have been performed in a macro-to-macro scenario, with
36 hexagonal cells wrapped around. Intermediate and worst case have been
analysed for speech at 8 Kbps. The results showed in the third paragraph
have been obtained using a sequential simulator that has been
\"adapted\" in order to reproduce different snapshots of the network. No
DCA technique is used. Radio resource assignment is random.

The simulator executes the following steps several times (snapshots):

\- loading of the system with a fixed number of users and mobile
distribution uniformly across the network;

\- execution of different power control loops to achieve system
stability;

\- evaluation of the total interference amount both for uplink and
downlink at the end of the power control loops.

The number of calls allowed for the multi-operator case is obtained
applying the \"6 dB noise rise\" criterion in UL and the \"satisfied
user criterion\" in DL, as illustrated in the FDD/FDD ACIR methodology
description. The former involves the average noise rise in the network
due to intracell interference, intercell interference and thermal noise,
the latter is based on the signal to noise ratio at the user equipment
and involves only intercell interference and thermal noise as perfect
joint detection is assumed. System capacity loss is evaluated comparing,
for different ACIR values, the number of calls allowed for the
multi-operator case with the number of calls allowed for the single
operator case.

#### 7.4.1.2 Non synchronised operators

Simulations have been performed in a macro-to-macro scenario with 36
hexagonal cells wrapped around. The lack of synchronisation between the
switching points of the two operators causes, with respect to the
scenario described in \[9\], a new situation from an adjacent channel
interference generation point of view. In the previous scenario, in
fact, the two operators were both in uplink or in downlink and the
adjacent channel interference was generated by the mobiles controlled by
the other operator in the first case and by the base stations belonging
to the other operator in the second one.

In this case the adjacent channel interference is generated in a
different manner. Let\'s suppose the first operator in uplink and the
second operator in downlink. The interference at each base station of
the operator 1 (uplink) is due to the following contributions:

\- co-channel interference generated by the mobiles controlled by the
operator 1;

\- adjacent channel interference due to the base stations belonging to
the operator 2 (BS-to-BS interference).

The interference at each mobile of the operator 2 (downlink) is due to
the following contributions:

\- co-channel interference due to the base stations transmitting on the
same frequency;

\- adjacent channel interference due to the mobiles controlled by the
operator 1 (MS-to-MS interference).

Therefore the adjacent channel interference due to the coexistence of
not synchronised operators is of two kinds: MS-to-MS interference,
suffered by the operator in downlink, and BS-to-BS interference,
suffered by the operator in uplink. The second one is more destructive
than the first one because of the involved powers and of the reduced
path losses (the base stations are supposed to be in line-of-sight).

In \[20\] the different scenarios obtained varying the base station
shifting of the two operators have been classified in best, intermediate
and worst case on the base of the amount of adjacent channel
interference with high probability suffered by the mobiles and by the
base stations in the system (BS-to-MS interference and MS-to-BS
interference).

In this case a new classification has to be introduced because the
adjacent channel interference is generated in a different manner. The
classification, based on the amount of BS-to-BS interference, the most
destructive interference due to the presence of a not synchronised
operator, is the following:

\- worst case scenario: 0 m base station shifting (co-siting);

\- intermediate case scenario: 577/2 m base station shifting;

\- best case scenario: 577 m base station shifting.

Our simulations aim to estimate in the intermediate scenario the
capacity loss suffered by the system because of the presence of a second
operator for different ACIR values. It is important to stress that when
we consider the uplink direction, the ACIR value applied to the adjacent
channel interference is obtained considering the ACLR and the ACS of the
base station and we will refer to this as ACIR BS-to-BS.

When we consider the downlink direction, the ACIR value applied to the
adjacent channel interference is obtained considering the ACLR and the
ACS of the mobile and we will refer to this as ACIR MS-to-MS.

##### 7.4.1.2.1 Description of the Propagation Models

###### 7.4.1.2.1.1 Minimum Coupling Loss (MCL)

The following values are assumed for the MCL (see \[20\]):

\- 70 dB for the links MS-to-BS and BS-to-MS;

\- 40 dB for the link MS-to-MS (this value has been obtained applying
the free space loss formula and considering 1 m as minimum separation
distance).

###### 7.4.1.2.1.2 BS-to-MS and MS-to-BS propagation model

We have applied the propagation model described in \[20\].

###### 7.4.1.2.1.3 BS-to-BS propagation model

The test scenario described in \[20\] implies that the base stations of
the two operators are in line-of-sight with clearance of the first
Fresnel zone. Therefore the propagation model applied is the free space
loss model (see \[17\]).

The base station antenna gain used to calculate the power received in
this case is 10 dB, instead of 13 dB, to consider the tilt of the
antennas.

Thus, since the distance between BSs of different operators is 577/2 m,
the path loss is 87 dB, and, including the antenna gains, 67 dB.

###### 7.4.1.2.1.4 MS-to-MS propagation model

The propagation model employed in NLOS condition is the outdoor macro
model based on the Xia formula described in \[16\]. The propagation
model employed in LOS condition is the free space loss model. The
standard deviation of the log‑normal fading is, in both cases, σ = 12
dB.

### 7.4.2 Simulation parameters

\[Editor\'s note: it has been clarified in the minutes of WG4 \# 6 that
the average TX power is 21 dBm and the peak power was assumed equal to
33 dBm; to be added to the list of parameters.\]

Uplink and downlink Eb/N0 targets have been derived from \[20\], where
link level simulation results for TDD mode are produced.

In table 7.1 a description of the parameters used in the simulations is
given. Changes in respect with parameters used for the FDD/FDD analysis
are reported in italic.

7A Methodology for coexistence studies of UTRA FDD with other radio technologies
================================================================================

7A.1 Introduction
-----------------

This Section includes specific simulation assumptions and parameters for
coexistence studies of UTRA FDD with other radio technologies (e.g. GSM,
IS-95) for additional frequency bands such as e.g. the 850 MHz bands
(Band V). Unless said otherwise, simulation methodologies and parameters
from Section 5 shall apply.

7A.2 Simulation layout
----------------------

Fig. 7A.1 shows the generic sectorized simulation layout and worst-case
offset between the interfereing systems. For this case, the cell radius
*R* is derived from the Inter-site distance ISD as *R = ISD/3*.

### 8.1.3 BTS Receiver Blocking

#### 8.1.3.1 Simulation Results for 1 Km cell radius

\[Editor\'s note: Please note that the results of the simulations are
still within brackets.\]

The first graph shows the overall CDF of the input signals to the
receivers, and the second shows an expanded view of the occurrences
having probability greater than .999. It can be seen that under the
conditions of this simulation, the largest signal occurs at an amplitude
of -54 dBm, and this occurs in less than 0,1 % of the cases. A minimum
coupling loss scenario would have produced more pessimistic results.

Of course, the conditions just described are for a 21 dBm terminal.
Simulations have not been done for a higher power terminal, but it is
reasonable to assume that approximate scaling of the power levels by 12
dB (from 21 dBm to 33 dBm) should occur. Therefore, it may be proposed
that -54 + 12 = -42 dBm should be considered a reasonable (if not
slightly pessimistic) maximum value for the largest W-CDMA blocking
signals.

Figure 8.7

Figure 8.8

#### 8.1.3.2 Simulation Results for 5 Km cell radius

Figure 8.9 shows the overall CDF of the input signals to the receivers
using speech only, and figure 8.10 shows an expanded view of the
occurrences having probability greater than .998. A sharp discontinuity
can be seen at the ‑49 dBm input level in the expanded view. This occurs
because in large cells there are a few occurrences of users operating at
their maximum transmitted power level of 21 dBm while they are also
close enough to another network\'s cell to produce a minimum coupling
loss condition. Therefore, for this large of a cell, the received signal
power level corresponding to 99,99 % of the occurrences is very close to
the level dictated by MCL and is about -49 dBm (= 21 dBm -- 70 dB).

The condition just described is for speech only systems with a maximum
transmitted power level of 21 dBm. It is probably reasonable to assume
that mixed speech and data systems would produce approximately the same
result if the maximum power level for a data terminal were also 21 dBm.
This is the case given in \[12\]. However, 33 dBm data terminals may
exist, so it would be desirable to consider this higher power case also.

Figures 8.11and 8.12 show the CDF of the input signals to the receivers
in mixed speech and data systems. These indicate that 99,99 % of
occurrences of the input signals to the receivers are about --40 dBm or
less. Of course, with this large of a cell, the absolute maximum signal
is dictated by MCL also and is only a few dB higher (33 dBm -- 70 dB =
-37 dBm).

Recent proposals from other companies have indicated that it may be
desirable to allow more than the 3 dB degradation in sensitivity that is
typically used in the measurement of a blocking spec. This is probably
reasonable since:

1\) the interfering UE\'s spurious and noise are going to dominate the
noise in the victim cell in a real system; and

2\) the measurement equipment is approaching the limit of its capability
in the performance of this test.

The first comment is evident by observing that the interfering UE\'s
noise two channels from its assigned frequency is probably typically in
the range of -90 dBm (= -40 dBm - 50 dB), which is greatly larger than
the typical noise floor of the receiver at -103 dBm. The second comment
is evident by observing that the typical noise floor of most high
quality signal generators is 65 dBc to 70 dBc with a W-CDMA signal. This
results in test equipment generated noise of -105 to ‑110 dBm, which can
produce a significant error in the blocking measurement.

In view of these concerns, it is probably reasonable to allow more than
a 3 dB increase in the specified sensitivity level under the blocking
condition. Other proposals recommend up to a 13 dB sensitivity
degradation in the blocking spec and a 6 dB degradation in similar specs
(like receiver spurious and IM). Motorola would consider 6 dB
preferable.

In conclusion, the in-band blocking specification for UTRA should be -40
dBm (assuming that 33 dBm terminals will exist), and the interfering
(blocking) test signal should be an HPSK carrier. A 6 dB degradation in
sensitivity under the blocking condition should be allowed.

#### 8.1.3.3 Simulation Results for macro-micro simulation scenario with 1 and 2 Km interfering macro cell radius

**Figure 8.13**: Zoom: Macro -- Micro Blocking data in one plot UE 33
dBm 1,2 and 5km (5 km case for additional information only).

Figure 8.13 shows a typical scenario for pure data UEs (33dBm) in a
Macro cell network with cell radii of 1, 2 or 5 km (5 km case for
additional information only).

According to , Sect 8.4.2.2 the target blocking probability for a
macro-macro scenario was assumed to be 1e-4 for the victim BS.
Considering that a micro BS will typically deploy only 1 carrier and
also that additional coverage may be available from an overlaid macro
network (ie single operator HCS scenario), the event of blocking a micro
BS may be considered as less severe then the blocking of a multi-carrier
macro BS. Hence, a slightly higher blocking probability of 2e-4 is
assumed for the micro BS to reflect this difference and to avoid overly
conservative blocking criteria.

It can be seen from Figure 8.13 that the Blocking performance
requirement for a general purpose BS of --40dBm interfering Signal mean
power, as it is specified in TS 25.104 (Rel.99, Rel. 4 and Rel. 5), is
not sufficient for a FDD Medium Range (Micro) base station (BS).

It has been shown in Figure 8.13 (which represents the worst case) that
for a high power UE (33dBm, data 144kbps) only in 0.02% of the cases the
received power is larger or equal to --35dBm and it is recommended to
use this value as new blocking requirement.

### 8.1.4 Transmit intermodulation for the UE

User Equipment(s) transmitting in close vicinity of each other can
produce intermodulation products, which can fall into the UE, or BS
receive band as an unwanted interfering signal. The transmit
intermodulation performance is a measure of the capability of the
transmitter to inhibit the generation of signals in its non linear
elements caused by presence of the wanted signal and an interfering
signal reaching the transmitter via the antenna.

The UE intermodulation attenuation is defined by the ratio of the output
power of the wanted signal to the output power of the intermodulation
product when an interfering CW signal is added at a level below the
wanted signal. Both the wanted signal power and the IM product power are
measured with a filter that has a Root-Raised Cosine (RRC) filter
response with roll-off α = 0,22 and a bandwidth equal to the chip rate.
This test procedure is identical to the ALCR requirement with the
exception of the interfering signal.

Therefore when performing this test, it is impossible to separate the
contribution due to ACLR due to the wanted signal which would fall into
the 1^st^ and 2^nd^ adjacent channel from the IMD product due to
addition of interfering signal. Therefore the IMD cannot be specified to
be the same value as the ALCR and has to be a lower value to account for
the worst case ALCR contribution.

It is proposed the IMD value should be lower than the ACLR value by 2
dB. This value is to ensure the overall specification is consistent.

### 8.1.5 Rational on test parameters for UE adjacent channel selectivity

Adjacent Channel Selectivity (ACS) is a measure of a receiver's ability
to receive a W-CDMA signal at its assigned channel frequency in the
presence of an adjacent channel signal at a given frequency offset from
the centre frequency of the assigned channel. ACS is the ratio of the
receive filter attenuation on the assigned channel frequency to the
receive filter attenuation on the adjacent channel(s).

However it is not possible to directly measure the ACS, instead the
lower and upper range of test parameters must be chosen where the BER
shall not exceed 0.001. The simulation scenarios and results leading to
the Case 2 test parameter on I~oac~ in \[2\] are then presented in this
section.

### 8.1.5.1 Macro / Micro Scenario

Simulation strategy: Snap-Shots:

Users are randomly placed over the system. If users in are in outage,
they are removed one-by-one. If the BS is overloaded by means of power,
remove a user, which has experienced the BS in question as "best server
during call set-up" (remove one user at a time). After each action, find
a balanced situation and continue to remove more users if needed.

Grade-of-service is obtained in the end when no users are in outage, and
all BS are below 20 W (GoS = \#users left in the system / \#users in the
beginning).

#### 8.1.5.2 OnOff Characteristic

All simulation results under this chapter are based on the assumption
that if the experienced ACI is higher than the investigated value, the
call will be dropped due to unknown characteristics of UE when received
ACI exceeds a particular one under investigation.

#### 8.2.1.2 Summary and Conclusions

Many simulations for FDD/TDD co-existence on HCS and one layer
environment considering either the ideal filter or the real filter and
C/I based power control have been investigated.

The results in the realistic condition, which are chosen from the table
in the previous clause are shown in table 8.6.

with high probability for all given scenarios in the most realistic
conditions.

##### 8.3.3.1.2 Comparison with the FDD/FDD coexistence analysis results

In tables 8.11 to 8.14 a comparison between our simulation results and
those previously presented \[27\] for FDD mode has been made. Analysis
of UL performances shows a different behavior of the TDD system when
ACIR is equal to 25 dB to 30 dB in UL, both in the intermediate and in
the worst case. On the contrary in DL system performances are similar
and we can conclude that in this case an ACIR value close to 30 dB could
be a good arrangement between system capacity and equipment realization.

Differences in UL performances are due to the noise rise criterion that
we think inadequate for systems that use JD technique. In fact in FDD
systems the high number of users and the absence of JD imply that the
total received power is almost equal to the overall disturbance. On the
contrary, in TDD systems the total received power is mainly composed by
intracell interference that can be eliminated by JD. Thus an high
average noise rise does not imply a high outage probability in the
network. An admission criterion based on C/I in UL also could be more
appropriate for the TDD case.

#### 8.3.3.2 Non synchronised operators

In figures 8.16 and 8.17 simulation results in uplink and in downlink
are produced. These results have been obtained performing 450 snapshots.

![](media/image39.wmf){width="5.084722222222222in"
height="3.8131944444444446in"}

Figure 8.17: ACIR MS-to-MS and system capacity loss in DL

Figure 8.17 shows that downlink performances are not influenced very
much by the presence of the second operator. This means that the
MS-to-MS interference is not problematic for the system for an ACIR
MS-to-MS value not lower than 30 dB.

In uplink the situation is different because of the presence of the
BS-to-BS interference. In the single operator case the system is hard
blocked. This means that the number of users per cell is determined only
on the base of the resource availability and not on the base of the
system interference. The introduction of a second operator not
synchronised implies a loss in the system capacity that becomes
acceptable for an ACIR BS-to-BS value between 50 dB and 55 dB.

8.4 Site engineering solutions for co-location of UTRA-FDD with UTRA-TDD
------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 8.4.1 General

The minimum blocking requirements and minimum ACLR requirements as
defined in \[3\] and \[4\] are not sufficient to enable the co-location
of UTRA-FDD and UTRA-TDD base stations at a minimum coupling loss of 30
dB. A single generic solution cannot cover all combinations of TDD and
FDD band allocation.

Instead site engineering solutions are required for this deployment
scenario. Such site engineering solutions will be addressed in more
detail in this section.

### 8.4.2 Interference Mechanism

For UTRA-FDD base station co-located with UTRA-TDD base stations, two
interference mechanisms have to be considered.

#### 8.4.2.1 Unwanted UTRA-TDD emissions

The unwanted emissions of the UTRA-TDD BS transmitter in the UTRA FDD
uplink bands have to be sufficiently low not to desensitise the UTRA-FDD
BS receiver. The following equation has to hold

I~acc~ ≥ P~unwant,TDD~ − CL

where

I~acc~ maximum acceptable interference level at the UTRA-FDD BS receiver

P~unwant,\ TDD~ unwanted emission at the UTRA-TDD BS transmitter
measured in the victim receive band

CL coupling loss between UTRA-TDD BS transmitter and UTRA-FDD BS
receiver

The maximum acceptable interference level I~acc~ depends on the cell
size. For macro cells the allowed interference level is typically below
the noise floor of the receiver.

The unwanted emission P~unwant,\ TDD~ of the UTRA-TDD base station in
the UTRA FDD uplink bands can be extracted from the spurious emission
and ACLR requirements specified in \[4\]. The spurious emission level
P~unwant,\ TDD~ is explicit in \[4\]. For the minimum ACLR requirement
the unwanted emission P~unwant,\ TDD~ can be calculated by

P~unwant,\ TDD~ = P~Tx,TDD~ -- ACLR

where P~Tx,TDD~ is the transmit power of the UTRA-TDD base station.

For a UTRA TDD BS that already fulfils the TS 25.105 \[4\] unwanted
emissions requirements for co-location with UTRA FDD, the ACLR and
spurious emission levels P~unwant,\ TDD~ are such that I~acc~ is below
--110 dBm for MCL = 30 dB. Additional site engineering solutions at the
aggressing UTRA TDD BS will then not be necessary for co-location.

#### 8.4.2.2 Blocking of UTRA-FDD BS receiver

To avoid blocking of the UTRA-FDD BS receiver, the following equation
has to hold

I~block~ ≥ P~TDD~ -- CL

where

I~block~ maximum acceptable level of an unwanted interferer in the
interferer transmit band

P~TDD~ transmit power of the UTRA-TDD BS

CL coupling loss between UTRA-TDD transmitter and UTRA-FDD BS receiver

The maximum acceptable level of an unwanted interferer I~block~ for the
UTRA-FDD base station can be extracted from the Adjacent Channel
Selectivity and blocking characteristics specified in \[3\].

### 8.4.3 Site engineering solutions

To enable the co-location of UTRA-FDD and UTRA-TDD base stations site
engineering has to limit the interference level at the UTRA-FDD BS
receiver as well as the maximum acceptable level of an unwanted
interferer in the interferer transmit band (blocking).

Different site engineering solutions are given in this section. These
site engineering solutions may be used alone or in combination to meet
the co-location requirements. The solutions apply either to the
aggressor (UTRA TDD BS) or the victim (UTRA FDD BS) as summarised in
Table 8.15.

Table 8.15: Parameters for co-siting and corresponding possible \[SITE
ENGINEERING SOLUTION\] UTRA TDD/FDD co-location.

+---------------------------+---------------------------+
| UTRA TDD BS (Aggressor)   | UTRA FDD BS (Victim)      |
+---------------------------+---------------------------+
| P~Tx,\ TDD~               | I~acc~ , I~block~         |
+---------------------------+---------------------------+
| ACLR, Spurious emissions  | ACS, Blocking req.        |
|                           |                           |
| \[UTRA TDD BS Tx filter\] | \[UTRA FDD BS Rx filter\] |
+---------------------------+---------------------------+
| MCL                       |                           |
|                           |                           |
| \[Antenna isolation\]     |                           |
+---------------------------+---------------------------+

The operator of the victim BS are in control of the parameters on the
right side in Table 8.15, while the parameters on the left are
controlled by the operator of the aggressing BS. The only site
engineering solution that the operator of the victim BS is in full
control of is additional UTRA FDD BS Receiver Filtering. The Scenario
Examples in Subclause 8.4.4 therefore apply FDD BS Rx filtering as site
engineering solution.

Depending on the deployment scenario for UTRA TDD BS, it is possible to
reduce the output power of the UTRA-TDD base station. In the same way,
in certain deployment scenarios the UTRA FDD BS may allow higher
interference and blocker levels. Changing those parameters are not
however generally applicable site engineering solutions.

#### 8.4.3.1 Antenna installation

The coupling loss is determined by the installation of the UTRA-TDD BS
transmit and UTRA-FDD BS receive antenna. As seen from \[28\], different
antenna configurations give raise to a large variation in coupling loss
values.

#### 8.4.3.2 RF filters

##### 8.4.3.2.1 UTRA-TDD base station transmitter filter

The unwanted emission of the UTRA-TDD base station transmitter in the
victim receive band P~unwant,\ TDD~ may be reduced by additional RF
filters incorporated into the transmitter chain of the UTRA-TDD base
station. To obtain an effective suppression of the unwanted emissions
and a negligible suppression of the wanted signal, band-pass filters
with high Q ceramic resonators can be used.

##### 8.4.3.2.2 UTRA-FDD base station receiver filter

The level of unwanted interference in the interferer transmit band
I~block~ may be decreased by additional RF filters incorporated into the
receiver chain of the UTRA-FDD base station. To obtain an effective
suppression of the unwanted interferer and only a small suppression of
the wanted receive signal, band-pass or band-stop filters with high Q
ceramic resonators can be used.

### 8.4.4 Scenario Examples

#### 8.4.4.1 General

The site-engineering solutions shown in this chapter are describing
co-location scenarios of a Wide Area BS UTRA-FDD with a Wide Area BS
UTRA-TDD that fulfils the applicable co-location requirements in \[4\].
Co-location of other BS classes (Micro, Local Area) needs to be studied
when the BS classification investigations are finalized and the Micro
and Local Area base station requirements are included in the core
specifications.

Scenario 1, 2a and 2b together, as described below, are allowing the use
of the whole FDD spectrum.

Scenario 1 in chapter 8.4.4.2 is describing the situation when UTRA-FDD
and UTRA-TDD are using adjacent frequencies at 1920 MHz. For those
adjacent FDD and TDD frequency bands co-location with 30dB is not
possible. However, those adjacent FDD and TDD frequencies can still be
used in the network given the stated minimum BS-BS coupling loss is
ensured.

Co-location site solutions for the non-adjacent FDD and TDD frequency
bands are described in Scenario 2a and Scenario 2b.

The filter attenuation that is proposed in the following chapters
8.4.4.3 and 8.4.4.4 are examples based on the requirements of TS 25.104
regarding blocking and accepted performance degradation.

#### 8.4.4.2 Scenario 1: Both TDD and FDD adjacent to 1920 MHz

\- TDD range: ... -- 1920 MHz; TDD BS output power: +43dBm

\- FDD range: 1920 --... MHz

![](media/image40.wmf){width="4.322916666666667in"
height="3.092361111111111in"}

Figure 8.18

Co-location of UTRA-FDD and UTRA-TDD with 30dB BS-BS coupling loss is
even with cryogenic technology not possible due to the adjacent FDD and
TDD channels without sufficient guard bands.

If only the site engineering solution "antenna installation" is used,
the required BS -- BS minimum coupling loss for this scenario is at
least:

+43dBm -- (-52dBm \[FDD ACS\]) = 95dB

#### 8.4.4.3 Scenario 2a: TDD 1900-1915 MHz and FDD 1920-1940 MHz

\- TDD range: 1900 -- 1915 MHz; TDD BS output power: +43dBm

\- FDD range: 1920 -- 1940 MHz

Co-location of UTRA-FDD and UTRA-TDD with 30dB BS-BS coupling loss is
possible by adding an external filter in the UTRA-FDD UL chains.

================================

9.1 Simulation results on TDD local area BS and FDD wide area BS coexistence
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 9.1.1 Introduction

The present document investigates the possibility of UTRA TDD-UTRA FDD
coexistence. There are several possible configurations in which the
likelihood of intersystem interference to occur is anticipated. This
paper describes only one such situation. There might be other scenarios
too which might require similar consideration however they are beyond
the scope of the present document.

In the present document, the interaction between UTRA TDD indoor and
UTRA FDD macro systems is studied. Here it has been considered that UTRA
TDD and UTRA FDD systems belong to two different operators and are
operating in adjacent bands. For UTRA FDD only UL is modelled. Owing to
the frequency separation between UTRA TDD and UTRA FDD DL band the
interference between UTRA TDD and UTRA FDD DL may not be very
predominant. The results are presented in terms of capacity losses.

### 9.1.2 Simulator Description

The simulator used for evaluation of UTRA TDD and UTRA FDD co-existence
is a static system level simulator. Simulations are based on snapshots
were users are randomly placed in a predefined deployment scenario. In
each snapshot a power control loop is simulated until Eb/N0 target is
reached. Simulation is made of several snapshots. The simulations are so
conducted that the first set of simulation statistics is collected for
independent environments (TDD Alone or FDD alone) and the second round
of simulations constitutes of placing the two systems TDD and FDD in
adjacent bands and the simulation statistics is recollected. The
simulation statistics collected in a standalone environment and in
adjacent channel operation environment determines the impact of the
intersystem interference between TDD and FDD operating in adjacent
bands. This is expressed in terms of capacity losses, power distribution
behaviour and interference levels in each system.

#### 9.1.2.1 Simulation procedure overview

A simulation step (snapshot) consists of mobile placement, pathloss
calculations, handover, and power control and statistics collection. At
the beginning of each simulation, UE\'s are randomly distributed. After
the placement, the path loss between each UE and the BS is calculated,
adding the lognormal fading, and stored to so called *G-matrix* (Gain
matrix). Distance attenuation and lognormal fading are kept constant
during the execution of a snapshot. Then power control loop is started.
During this the power control is executed till the used power will reach
the level required by the required quality. During the power control
loop, the Gain Matrix remains constant. Sufficient number of power
control commands in each power control loop should be greater than 150.

At the end of a power control loop, statistical data is collected. UE\'s
whose quality is below the target Eb/N0-0,5 dB are considered to be in
outage state and UE\'s whose quality is higher than the target Eb/N0-0,5
dB are considered to be satisfied.

When a single step (snapshot) is finished, UE\'s are re-located to the
system and the above process is executed again. Multiple snapshots are
executed to achieve sufficient amount for local mean SIR values.

#### 9.1.2.2 System Scenario

In the present document, hierarchical system with FDD in macro and TDD
in pico environment has been chosen. The systems have been deployed as
indicated in figure 9.1.The hexagonal cells represent the FDD macrocells
and the TDD indoor system has been mapped on to the FDD middle cell. The
TDD indoor layout has been adopted from \[9\].

![](media/image43.wmf){width="2.2305555555555556in"
height="2.7534722222222223in"}

Figure 9.1: TDD pico and FDD Macro evaluation layout; pico model chosen
from \[31\]

Here, it is assumed that TDD is operating inside the building hence the
signals entering and exiting the building are attenuated because of the
wall losses. In order to model the attenuation, an additional loss of 10
dB is added to the path loss of all signals crossing the TDD cell edge.

Statistics from FDD is collected from the central cell only. And this
cell is the COI (Cell of Interest). The multiple FDD cells have been
deployed to generate adequate FDD interference for the TDD system. The
FDD macro cell range has been set to 500 m.

#### 9.1.2.3 Propagation Model

##### 9.1.2.3.1 TDD BS to TDD UE

This model is obtained from \[9\]. The indoor path loss model expressed
in dB is in the following simplified form, which is derived from the
COST 231 indoor model. This low increase of path loss versus distance is
a worst-case from the interference point of view:

L~1~ = 37 + 30log~10~(r) + 18.3n^((n+2)/(n+1)-0.46)^

Where:

\- r is the transmitter-receiver separation given in metres;

\- n is the number of floors in the path.

NOTE: The UE-UE and BS-BS propagation model for the indoor environment
are the same as BS-UE propagation model except that the antenna gains
are different.

##### 9.1.2.3.2 FDD UE to FDD BS

The FDD UE-FDD BS propagation model, obtained originally from \[9\], is
applicable for the test scenarios in urban and suburban areas outside
the high rise core where buildings are of nearly uniform height.
Assuming, that the base station antenna height is fixed at 15 m above
the rooftop, and a carrier frequency of 2 GHz is used, the FDD UE-FDD BS
path loss *L~2~* can be expressed as \[2\]:

L~2~ = 15.3 + 37.6log~10~ (r)

Where:

*- r* is the transmitter-receiver separation in meters.

##### 9.1.2.3.3 TDD UE to FDD BS

This is determined from *L~2\ ~*described above by adding wall loss
attenuation to the calculated value.

##### 9.1.2.3.4 FDD UE to TDD UE

For this path, it depends where the FDD terminals are located if the FDD
terminals are within the indoor system then the pathless *L~1\ is~*
chosen otherwise if the FDD Terminals are outside the indoor system then
*L~2\ ~*is chosen, to *L~2\ ~*wall loss attenuation is added.

##### 9.1.2.3.5 FDD UE to TDD BS

For this path, it depends where the FDD terminals are located if the FDD
terminals are within the indoor system then the pathloss L1 is chosen
otherwise if the FDD Terminals are outside the indoor system then L2 is
chosen, to L2 wall loss attenuation is added.

##### 9.1.2.3.6 TDD BS to FDD BS

The TDD BS-FDD BS path loss is calculated with the help of *L~2~* and
the wall loss attenuation is added to *L~2.~*

In the system simulations, a log-normally distributed shadowing
component with standard deviation of 10 dB (macro cell) or 12 dB (pico
cell) is added to calculated propagation path loss.

#### 9.1.2.4 Power Control

Power control is a simple SIR based power control. Perfect power control
is assumed. With the assumption of perfect power control, PC error is
assumed equal to 0 %, and PC delay is assumed to be 0 s.

\- TDD UL Power Control Range: 65 dB.

\- TDD DL Power Control Range: 30 dB.

\- FDD UL Power Control Range: 65 dB.

#### 9.1.2.5 Interference Modelling Methodology

The interference calculations are done such that in each links (UL or
DL) the total interference is the sum of intra system interference and
inter system interference\'s). In calculations for the intersystem
interference, the RF characteristics of transmitter and receiver are
taken into account by weighting adjacent system signal with a parameter
ACIR. The definition for ACIR and other related radio parameters is
explained below.

***ACLR:*** is a measure of transmitter performance. It is defined as
the ratio of the transmitted power to the power measured after a
receiver filter in the adjacent RF channel. Both the transmitted power
and the received power are measured with a filter response that is
root-raised cosine, with a noise power bandwidth equal to the chip rate.

***ACS:*** is measure of receiver performance. It is defined as the
ratio of the receiver filter attenuation on the assigned channel
frequency to the receiver filter attenuation on the adjacent frequency.

***ACIR:*** is a measure of over all system performance. It is defined
as the ratio of the total power transmitted from a source (base station
or UE) to the total interference power affecting a victim receiver,
resulting from both transmitter and receiver imperfections. They have
following relationship:

$\text{ACIR} = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{\text{ACLR}} + \frac{1}{\text{ACS}}}$.

For these simulations ACLR\'s and ACS\'s used are have been described in
table 9.1.

### 9.1.3 Capacity Calculations

#### 9.1.3.1 Calculation of Single Operator Capacity for TDD and FDD 

In order to study the impact of capacity due to adjacent channel
interference between TDD and FDD the capacity evaluation of individual
operators is done as follows. Single operator capacity designated by
$N\text{Single}$ for each system is determined as follows:

1\) generate BS\'s as per the selected environment (indoor case selected
in these simulations);

2\) reset the output data collection counters;

3\) generate mobiles randomly;

4\) calculate the path loss between each UE and the base station;

5\) determine the best server;

6\) calculate the co-channel interference;

7\) control power till it stabilizes such that the used power will reach
the level required by the required quality. This is the stabilization
period;

8\) execute sufficient number of power control commands in each power
control loop;

9\) collect the statistical data for outage and satisfied users .This is
based on:

\- UE\'s whose SIR is lower than the target (in outage) and UEs whose
SIR is higher than the target (satisfied);

10\) increase or decrease the$N\text{Single}$ and start again till the
satisfied user criterion is achieved.

The co-channel interference is modeled in the similar manner as
described in \[12\]. Since in DL, the multiple transmitted signals are
synchronously combined the intra operator interference is multiplied by
orthogonality factor.

#### 9.1.3.2 Calculation of Multi Operator Capacity 

Mullet operator capacity designated by $N\text{Multi}$ is calculated as
follows:

1\) generate BS\'s as per the selected environment (option for
pico,micro and macro.Pico considered here);

2\) reset the output data collection counters;

3\) generate mobiles randomly;

4\) Calculate the path loss between each UE and the base station;

5\) determine the best server;

6\) calculate the co-channel interference and the adjacent channel
interference at the victim station. (If the victim is TDD adjacent
channel interference is from FDD system, if the victim is FDD adjacent
channel interference is from TDD system);

7\) control power till it stabilizes such that the used power will reach
the level required by the required quality. This is the stabilization
period;

8\) a sufficient number of power control commands in each power control
loop are executed;

9\) collect the statistical data for outage and satisfied users for each
operator .This is based on:

\- UE\'s whose SIR is lower than the target (in outage) and UEs whose
SIR is higher than the target (satisfied);

10\) increase or decrease the $N\text{Multi}$ and start again till the
satisfied user criterion is achieved.

#### 9.1.3.3 Calculation of relative capacity loss

$N\text{Single}$ and $N\text{Multi}$ were determined above. The relative
capacity loss in each system is calculated as follows:

$C = 1 - \frac{N\text{Single}}{N\text{Multi}}$,

where $C$is the relative capacity loss of the system.

The *capacity criterion* is such that the UE\'s whose SIR at the end of
the simulation is lower than the target Eb/N0 are in outage whereas
UE\'s whose SIR is above the Eb/N0 are satisfied. At each simulation
round it is assumed that 95 % of the users fulfil the satisfied user
criterion.

### 9.1.5 Simulation results

The impact of TDD interference to FDD system was studied by locating the
TDD indoor system in different locations in the FDD COI. The FDD and TDD
system capacity losses were observed as function of coupling loss
between TDD system and FDD macro BS. The results are summarised in table
9.3.

BS and TDD pico system

The results indicate that TDD indoor system capacity is not
significantly affected by adjacent channel FDD interference. This is
because there is adequate power available in TDD system to handle FDD
interference.

### 9.1.6 Conclusions

Results indicate:

\- no impact on TDD system capacity due to FDD operating in adjacent
channel in this mode (FDD macro configuration);

\- minor capacity losses are experienced by FDD UL if TDD system is too
close to FDD BS (note however 10 m separation case is not valid from
practical implementation point of view);

\- adjacent channel operation of TDD and FDD system under stated
conditions is possible;

\- also, the TX powers of TDD entities in these simulations are very
high. In practice, power levels in Local area TDD cells (in UL and DL)
are obviously lower. Thus impact on FDD UL shall be reduced further.

10 Antenna-to-Antenna Isolation
===============================

10.1 Rationale for MCL value for co-located base stations
---------------------------------------------------------

The coupling losses between two co-sited base stations are depending on
e.g. the deployment scenario and BS antenna gain values. As seen from
e.g. \[28\], different deployment scenarios give raise to a large
variation in coupling loss values. However, in order not to have
different requirements for different deployment scenarios, it is
fruitful to use one value of the minimum coupling loss (MCL)
representing all deployment scenarios.

For the case of two operators co-siting their antenna installations on a
roof-top, the antennas could be situated in each other\'s far-fields and
the isolation that occur between the sites can be analysed using the
ordinary Friis\' transmission equation:

$\text{Isolation\ }\left\lbrack \text{dB} \right\rbrack = \text{20}\ \text{log}_{\text{10}}\left( \frac{2\text{πR}}{\lambda} \right) - \text{Gain\ }\left\lbrack \text{dBi} \right\rbrack,$

where *R* is the distance between the antennas,$\lambda$ is the
wavelength and Gain is the total effective gain of the two antennas.

When applying this equation to a deployment scenario with a separation
distance of 10 meters between the two sites, both using 65^ο^ (14 dBi)
sector antennas, an isolation of about 30 dB occur when the antennas are
situated in a 35^ο^ angle compared to each other. This deployment
scenario is regarded as typical to many co-sited antenna installations.

A coupling loss value of 30 dB also coincides with the minimum coupling
loss value reported in \[29\] and one of the measured antenna
configurations in \[28\]. It is also typical to many existing
installations, as reported by several operators.

10.2 Rationale for MCL value for operation of base stations in the same geographic area
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In general, unwanted emissions limits of base stations for coexistence
are devided into requirements for operation in the same geographic area
and co-located base stations. The requirements for operation in the same
geographic area protect the victim mobile and the requirements for
co-located base stations protect the victim base station.

Due to the spectrum arrangement of TDD and FDD, 3GPP defines in addition
unwanted emission limits for TDD base stations for protection of the
victim base station for operation in the same geographic area. In the
same way as for co-located base stations, these additional limits are
based on a specific MCL value between base stations. The assumed MCL
values between base stations for operation in the same geographic area
are explained below.

### 10.2.1 Wide Area and Geneal Purpose Base Station

It is assumed that the Wide Area and General Purpose BS is mainly
deployed in Micro and Macro Environments. Due to the low receiver noise
floor of the Macro base station, it is assumed that the Macro BS to
Macro BS interference scenario is the most critical situation. That
means eventhough the coupling loss for Micro BS to Micro BS or Macro BS
to Micro BS may be lower, the desensitisation of the Micro BS would lead
to less demanding requirements.

The following scenario is captured in chapter 7.4.1.2.1.3 BS-to-BS
propogation model:

87 dB Pathloss (288 m Line-of-sight)

+13 dB TX antenna gain

+13 dB RX antenna gain

-6 dB Reduction in effective antenna gain due to antenna tilt

= 67 dB MCL

A MCL of 67 dB is considered as the reference scenario for Macro BS to
Macro BS interference for operation in the same geographic area.

For the adjacent channels, where the ACLR requirement applies, an
increase of 7 dB for the MCL is assumed, that means a MCL of 74 dB. The
increase in MCL is justified by the lower number of interfering base
stations, if only adjacent carriers are considered. Further, if the
adjacent channels are controlled by the same operator, the carriers may
not be deployed in the same hierarchical cell layer in proximity. Note
that a requirement for adjacent carriers based on a MCL of 74 dB between
Macro base stations may be as well used for Macro base stations with a
MCL of 67 dB, if a higher desensitisation of the victim base station is
acceptable. I. e. for FDD Macro base stations with a MCL of 67 dB
instead of 74 dB the desensitisation would be 3 dB instead of 0.8 dB.

### 10.2.2 Local Area Base Station

It is assumed that the Local Area is deployed in Pico Environments. Due
to the low receiver noise floor of the Macro base station, it is assumed
that the Pico BS to Macro BS interference scenario is the most critical
situation. That means eventhough the coupling loss for Pico BS to Pico
BS or Pico BS to Micro BS may be lower, the desensitisation of the Micro
and Pico BS would lead to less stringent requirements.

The Pico BS is similar to a mobile in respect to output power, antenna
gain and antenna heights. Therefore for the Pico BS to Macro BS, the
same MCL as for the UE to Macro BS is assumed. I. e. a MCL of 70 dB is
considered as the reference scenario for Pico BS to Macro BS
interference for operation in the same geographic area.

For the adjacent channels, where the ACLR requirement applies, an
increase of 7 dB for the MCL is assumed, that means a MCL of 77 dB. The
increase in MCL is justified by the lower number of interfering base
stations, if only adjacent carriers are considered. Note that a
requirement based on a MCL of 77 dB between Pico and Macro base station
may be as well used for base stations with a MCL of 70 dB, if a higher
desensitisation of the victim base station is accepted. I. e. for FDD
Macro base stations with a MCL of 70 dB instead of 77 dB to Pico base
stations the desensitisation would be 3 dB instead of 0.8 dB.

For the adjacent channels, where the ACLR requirement applies and the
carrier separation is 5 MHz or less, an additional increase of 10 dB for
the MCL is assumed, that means a MCL of 87 dB. The increase in MCL is
justified by the fact that Local Area base stations will be deployed
indoors or significantly below roof top. In these scenarios it may
possible to increase the MCL by some adjustment (e.g. deployment around
the corner or in the next room). Further, if the adjacent channels are
controlled by the same operator, the carriers may not be deployed in the
same hierarchical cell layer in proximity. The additional 10 dB assume a
typical indoor to outdoor penetration loss.

10.3 Rationale for MCL values for co-sited base stations of different classes
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The requirements for co-location of base stations assume 30dB minimum
coupling loss between base stations of the same class. However, even if
the requirements for the BS classes have been derived based on specific
deployment assumptions for each class, a co-siting of different classes
cannot be excluded. Due to the relaxed requirements for spurious
emissions and blocking for the Medium Range and Local Area BS a coupling
loss of 30 dB is not sufficient to enable co-existence in case of
co-siting of different classes. Therefore, if BS's of different classes
are co sited, the coupling loss of 30 dB assumed for co-location must be
increased by the maximum difference between the corresponding limits of
spurious emissions and blocking for the co-sited BS classes. The
corresponding additional coupling loss values to be added to the 30 dB
coupling loss for co-location are listed in table 10.1 and table 10.2.

11 Modulation accuracy
======================

11.1 Downlink modulation accuracy
---------------------------------

### 11.1.1 Simulation Condition and Definition

For simplification, degradation was evaluated in terms of BER
performance against modulation accuracy under the following assumptions
that:

\- propagation channel is static one, having a single path without
Rayleigh fading;

\- receiver has no RAKE receiver, diversity reception nor channel
coding;

\- ideal coherent demodulation is performed;

\- measured channel is all data throughout a frame;

\- each of information bit streams is generated by a pseudo random
binary sequence of 15-stage having a different initial phase, spread by
an independent orthogonal spreading code, and is multiplexed.

Modulation accuracy is supposed to be degraded by various factors like
imperfection of roll-off filters, imbalance of quadrature modulators,
phase jitters of local oscillators and etc. In the simulation, we have
not given all possible degradation factors one by one, instead of which,
we assumed that overall behaviour of error vectors caused by each
degradation factor is Gaussian. As defined in clause 6.8.2 of TS 25.104
\[3\], a vector error was deliberately introduced and added to
theoretically modulated waveform, and the square root of the ratio of
the mean error vector power to the mean signal power was calculated in a
%.

### 11.1.2 Simulation Results

Figure 11.1 shows degradation of Eb/No at a BER of 10^-3^ against the
modulation accuracy for three spreading factors (SF) of 4, 16 and 64
respectively, under condition of single code operation. In figure 11.2,
performance degradation is shown for the case that number of channels
multiplexed is 1, 4 and 16, keeping total information bit rate the same
at a traffic level of a quarter of maximum system capacity. Figure 11.3
demonstrates similar degradation for different combination of SF and
number of users, where traffic load is increased to half of maximum
system capacity in comparison to the case of figure 11.2.

Figure 11.3: Degradation for the case of a half the maximum traffic load

### 11.1.3 Considerations

Firstly, as the number of users (or channels) to be multiplexed
increases, degradation against modulation accuracy increases compared to
the case of single code transmission. Secondarily, degradation of BER
performance against modulation accuracy does not depend on a spreading
factor, SF, but on total information bit rate given to the system. For
instance, for a given modulation accuracy, single code transmission for
SF of 4 causes almost the same degradation for the multi code
transmission of 16 channels for SF of 64. Finally, in case that total
traffic load given to the system is half of full capacity, difference of
degradation at modulation accuracy of 12,5 % and 23 % is about 0,8 dB.

Though the simulation was carried out for evaluation of modulation
accuracy especially for base station, the results could also be used for
another evaluation of that for UE by referring the case for single code
operation shown in figure 11.1.

### 11.1.4 Conclusion

Though the simulation does not use measurement channel models consistent
with those used in link level simulation work appearing in the pertinent
specification documents, it gives prediction that mitigation of
modulation accuracy of 12,.5 % to 23 % may cause not negligible
degradation to BER performance. Even in the case that total traffic load
is half of maximum overall system capacity, the simulation results show
degradation of 0,8 dB, and it is obvious that as number of channels
comes close to maximum system capacity the degradation increases to a
larger extent. Therefore, Fujitsu believes that the current modulation
accuracy value of 12,5 % is quite reasonable and that the value should
be kept in the document of TS 25.104 \[3\] as it is.

11.2 Uplink Modulation Accuracy
-------------------------------

### 11.2.1 Value for Modulation Accuracy

The specification value for
![](media/image48.wmf){width="0.5541666666666667in"
height="0.22083333333333333in"} should be chosen to provide sufficient
receiver performance and to limit the extra noise power that could be
transmitted.

Receiver performance is determined by
![](media/image49.wmf){width="0.6652777777777777in"
height="0.22083333333333333in"}. A typical minimum requirement for EVM
in other cellular systems is 12,5 %. Assuming 12,5 % should be
guaranteed for ![](media/image49.wmf){width="0.6652777777777777in"
height="0.22083333333333333in"} even up to 2,048 kbps. Then
corresponding minimum requirement for
![](media/image48.wmf){width="0.5541666666666667in"
height="0.22083333333333333in"} should be 25 %. Tougher requirements
will provide unnecessary implementation constraints for terminals that
do not support these high data rates.

With 25 % ![](media/image48.wmf){width="0.5541666666666667in"
height="0.22083333333333333in"}, the maximum amplitude of the noise
error vector is 25 % of the amplitude of the signal vector. This means
that the total UE power maybe increased by maximum 0,26 dB \"noise
power\". The table below gives the relation between
![](media/image48.wmf){width="0.5541666666666667in"
height="0.22083333333333333in"} and worst-case additional power
transmitted by UE.

Considering the system performance, receiver performance and
implementation perspective, a value of 17,5 % was considered a
reasonable minimum requirement for WCDMA uplink modulation accuracy.

12 UE active set size
=====================

12.1 Introduction
-----------------

The UE is connected to one or several cells in active mode. The cells to
which the UE is connected to is called the active set (AS). The cells
maybe sectors of the same (softer handover) BS or separate (soft
handover) BS. The maximum required number of cells simultaneously in the
AS (maximum size of the AS) is studied in this paper.

The study has been done with help of a static network planning tool
where a very simple SHO criterion was applied.

12.2 Simulation assumptions
---------------------------

The used planning tool prototype can perform snapshot simulations and/or
pixel by pixel calculations. For this study the pixel by pixel
calculations were sufficient.

The SHO criterion was to include to the active set of a map pixel 1) the
best cell, meaning the largest measured received CPICH Ec/No, and 2) all
the cells within WINDOW\_ADD from the best cell. Furthermore the size of
the active set in a pixel is the number of the cells in the active set
of that pixel.

In most simulations the WINDOW\_ADD parameter was 5 dB. The basis for
this choice was to have approximately 40% soft handover probability
which was considered as a worst, but still a realistic case.

The pixels from which the UE is not able to maintain a connection due to
uplink power limitation are doomed to outage and at these pixels the
size of the active set is set to zero. In all but the last simulation
case the uplink outage was calculated for 144 kbit data. In the last
case the uplink outage was calculated for 8 kbit/s speech. The radio
network planning was targeted to better than 95 % coverage probability.

The simulations were done on the following cell layouts:

\- Case 1: Three sectored, 65° antenna;

\- Case 2: Three sectored, 90° antenna;

\- Case 3: Three sectored, 65° antenna, bad radio network planning;

\- Cases 4: Standard omni scenario used in the ACIR coexistence
analysis:

\- Case 4a: WINDOW\_ADD = 5 dB;

\- Case 4b: WINDOW\_ADD = 3 dB;

\- Case 4c: WINDOW\_ADD = 7 dB;

\- Case 5: Realistic map.

In all but the last case the distance loss was calculated as 128,1 +
37,6 × lg(R), as used in the ACIR coexistence analysis, on top of which
a log-normally distributed shadow fading term was added, with standard
deviation of 10 dB. The log normal fading was generated so that the
correlation between the fading terms from any pair of cells was 0,5. In
the last case the distance loss was calculated by an extended
Okumura-Hata model with area type correction factors fit to measured
data.

layout is depicted and then the distribution of the active set size is

12.4 Conclusions
----------------

In all simulations there were less than 1% of the area in which there
was equal number or more than 7 cells needed to the active set according
to the SHO criteria. On the other hand assuming ideal HO measurements by
UE and delay free HO procedure the gain of having more than 3 best cells
in the active set is minimal. Thus, including extreme cases it can be
concluded that UE does not have to support more than 4-6 as the maximum
size of the active set.

### 13.1.2 CDMA equations

The equations listed below describe the relationship between various
parameters under different conditions.

#### 13.1.2.1 BS Transmission Power

Transmit power of the Base Station is normalized to 1 and can be
presented as:

$\ \frac{\text{PCCPCH}_{}}{I_{\text{or}}} + \ \frac{\text{Pilot}_{}}{I_{\text{or}}} + \ \frac{\text{TPC}_{}}{I_{\text{or}}} + \ \frac{\text{TFCI}_{}}{I_{\text{or}}} + \ \frac{\text{DATA}_{}}{I_{\text{or}}} + \ \frac{\text{SCCPCH}_{}}{I_{\text{or}}} + \ \frac{\text{OCNS}_{}}{I_{\text{or}}} = 1$.

Dedicated Physical Channel consists of four different fields. Therefore,
it can be shown that:

$\ \frac{\text{DPCH}_{}}{I_{\text{or}}} = \ \frac{\text{Pilot}_{}}{I_{\text{or}}} + \ \frac{\text{TPC}_{}}{I_{\text{or}}} + \ \frac{\text{TFCI}_{}}{I_{\text{or}}} + \ \frac{\text{DATA}_{}}{I_{\text{or}}}$.

Hence, transmit power of Base Station can be presented also as:

$\ \frac{\text{PCCPCH}_{}}{I_{\text{or}}} + \ \frac{\text{DPCH}_{}}{I_{\text{or}}} + \ \frac{\text{SCCPCH}_{}}{I_{\text{or}}} + \ \frac{\text{OCNS}_{}}{I_{\text{or}}} = 1$.

#### 13.1.2.2 Rx Signal Strength for UE Not in Handoff (Static propagation conditions)

For PCCPCH we get:

$\text{PCCPCH}\ \frac{E_{c}}{I_{o}} = \frac{\ \frac{\text{PCCPCH}_{}}{I_{\text{or}}}}{\frac{I_{\text{oc}}}{{\hat{I}}_{\text{or}}} + 1}$,

and for a Dedicated Physical Channel:

$\text{DPCH}\ \frac{E_{c}}{I_{o}} = \frac{\ \frac{\text{DPCH}_{}}{I_{\text{or}}}}{\frac{I_{\text{oc}}}{{\hat{I}}_{\text{or}}} + 1}$.

For the Secondary Common Control Physical Channel we get:

$\text{SCCPCH}\ \frac{E_{c}}{I_{o}} = \frac{\ \frac{\text{SCCPCH}_{}}{I_{\text{or}}}}{\frac{I_{\text{oc}}}{{\hat{I}}_{\text{or}}} + 1}$.

$E_{b}/N_{t}$ for the PCCPCH is given as:

$\text{PCCPCH}\ \frac{E_{b}}{N_{t}} = \frac{\frac{\text{PCCPCH}_{}}{I_{\text{or}}} \times \frac{\text{Chip\ Rate}}{\text{Information\ Data\ Rate}}}{\frac{I_{\text{oc}}}{{\hat{I}}_{\text{or}}}}$.

The same for Dedicated Channels is given as:

$\text{DCH}\ \frac{E_{b}}{N_{t}} = \frac{\frac{\text{DPCH}_{}}{I_{\text{or}}} \times \frac{\text{Chip\ Rate}}{\text{Information\ \ Data\ Rate}}}{\frac{I_{\text{oc}}}{{\hat{I}}_{\text{or}}}}$.

Similar equations can be derived for the Paging Channel and for the
Forward Access Channel. For the Paging Channel we get:

$\text{PCH}\ \frac{E_{b}}{N_{t}} = \frac{\frac{\text{SCCPCH}_{}}{I_{\text{or}}} \times \frac{\text{Chip\ Rate}}{\text{Paging\ Data\ Rate}}}{\frac{I_{\text{oc}}}{{\hat{I}}_{\text{or}}}}$,

and the same for FACH is given as:

$\text{FACH}\ \frac{E_{b}}{N_{t}} = \frac{\frac{\text{SCCPCH}_{}}{I_{\text{or}}} \times \frac{\text{Chip\ Rate}}{\text{Control\ Data\ Rate}}}{\frac{I_{\text{oc}}}{{\hat{I}}_{\text{or}}}}$.

#### 13.1.2.3 Rx Strength for UE Not in Handoff (Static propagation conditions)

Let us assume that the sum of the channel tap powers is equal to one in
multi-path propagation conditions with L taps, i.e.:

$\sum_{i = 1}^{L}a_{i^{2}} = 1$,

where $a_{i}$represent the complex channel coefficient of the tap i.
When assuming that a receiver combines all the multi-paths $E_{b}/N_{t}$
for PCCPCH is given as:

$\text{PCCPCH}\ \frac{E_{b}}{N_{t}} = \frac{\text{PCCPCH}_{}}{I_{\text{or}}} \times \frac{\text{Chip\ Rate}}{\text{Information\ Data\ Rate}} \times \sum_{i = 1}^{L}\frac{a_{i^{2}}}{\frac{I_{\text{oc}}}{{\hat{I}}_{\text{or}}} + \left( 1 - a_{i^{2}} \right)}$.

As an example $E_{b}/N_{t}$ for PCCPCH in Indoor channel is:

$\text{PCCPCH}\ \frac{E_{b}}{N_{t}} = \frac{\text{PCCPCH}_{}}{I_{\text{or}}} \times \frac{\text{Chip\ Rate}}{\text{Bearer\ Data\ Rate}} \times \left( \frac{0\text{.}\text{900824}}{\frac{I_{\text{oc}}}{{\hat{I}}_{\text{or}}} + 0\text{.}\text{099176}} + \frac{0\text{.}\text{098773}}{\frac{I_{\text{oc}}}{{\hat{I}}_{\text{or}}} + 0\text{.}\text{901227}} + \frac{0\text{.}\text{000402}}{\frac{I_{\text{oc}}}{{\hat{I}}_{\text{or}}} + 0\text{.}\text{999598}} \right)$.

Using the same assumptions, $E_{b}/N_{t}$ for Dedicated Channels is
given as:

$\text{DCH}\ \frac{E_{b}}{N_{t}} = \frac{\text{DPCH}_{}}{I_{\text{or}}} \times \frac{\text{Chip\ Rate}}{\text{Information\ Data\ Rate}} \times \sum_{i = 1}^{L}\frac{a_{i^{2}}}{\frac{I_{\text{oc}}}{{\hat{I}}_{\text{or}}} + \left( 1 - a_{i^{2}} \right)}\ \text{.}$

#### 13.1.2.4 Rx Signal Strength for UE in two-way Handover

When the received power from each cell is ${\hat{I}}_{\text{or}}$ we get
for each PCCPCH Channel:

$\text{PCCPCH}\ \frac{E_{c}}{I_{o}} = \frac{\ \frac{\text{PCCPCH}_{}}{I_{\text{or}}}}{\frac{I_{\text{oc}}}{{\hat{I}}_{\text{or}}} + 2}$.

If the power received from cell 1 and cell 2 are
${\hat{I}}_{\text{or}1}$ and ${\hat{I}}_{\text{or}2}$, respectively,
then:

$\text{PCCPCH}\ \frac{E_{c}}{I_{o}}(\text{Cell\ 1}) = \frac{\ \frac{\text{PCCPCH}_{}}{I_{\text{or}1}}}{\frac{I_{\text{oc}}}{{\hat{I}}_{\text{or}1}} + \frac{{\hat{I}}_{\text{or}2}}{{\hat{I}}_{\text{or}1}} + 1}$,

and:

$\text{PCCPCH}\ \frac{E_{c}}{I_{o}}(\text{Cell\ 2}) = \frac{\ \frac{\text{PCCPCH}_{}}{I_{\text{or}2}}}{\frac{I_{\text{oc}}}{{\hat{I}}_{\text{or}2}} + \frac{{\hat{I}}_{\text{or}1}}{{\hat{I}}_{\text{or}2}} + 1}$.

Similarly:

$\text{DCH}\ \frac{E_{b}}{N_{t}} = \frac{\text{DPCH}_{}}{I_{\text{or}}} \times \frac{\text{Chip\ Rate}}{\text{Information\ Data\ Rate}} \times \sum_{i = 1}^{L}\frac{2a_{i^{2}}}{\frac{I_{\text{oc}}}{{\hat{I}}_{\text{or}}} + 1 + \left( 1 - a_{i^{2}} \right)}$,

if the channel is non-static.

13.2 Amplitude statistics for TM1, TM5 and TM6
----------------------------------------------

The amplitude statistics for TM1, TM5 and TM6 carrying QPSK, 16QAM and
64QAM modulation schemes are given for information in Figure E-1 and
Figure E-2, both as an unclipped signal and clipped signal (clipping at
a PAPR of 7 dB is used as an example) \[37\].

The unclipped waveforms in Figure 13.1 indicate that TM1 has the highest
PAPR compared to TM5 and TM6 while the clipped signals in Figure 13.2
have very similar amplitude properties. The conclusion is that
regardless of modulation scheme, TM1 is fully representative for
performing the TX requirements identified for testing with TM1 in
Clause 6.1.1.1 of TS 25.141 \[38\].

14 Rationales for unwanted emission specifications
==================================================

ITU specification splits the unwanted emissions specification in two
categories:

\- out-of band emissions;

\- spurious emissions.

The same approach was used in the TS 25.104 \[3\].

14.1 Out of band Emissions
--------------------------

Out of band emissions are unwanted emissions immediately outside the
channel bandwidth resulting from the modulation process and
non-linearity in the transmitter but excluding spurious emissions. This
out of band emission requirement is specified both in terms of spectrum
emission mask (SEM) and adjacent channel power ratio (ACLR) for the
transmitter. ACLR is specified mainly as a measure of the capability of
the transmitter to guarantee the interfering signal below an acceptable
level to the adjacent system to allow-coexistence. ACLR is also a
regulatory requirement in certain countries. SEM is specified mainly as
a measure of the capability of the transmitter to comply with certain
regional regulatory requirements.

### 14.1.1 Adjacent Channel Leakage Ratio

The system performances are linked to the ACIR values. ACIR in downlink
depends on ACS of the UE and ACLR of the Base Station. Constraints on
the UE PA design leads to UE ACLR value of 33 dB. It was then proposed
to use the same value for UE ACS (a note was added in the UE
specification to mention that requirement on the UE shall be
reconsidered when the state of the art technology progresses).

The minimum requirement for the Base Station was derived from UE ACS in
such a way that the BTS contribution on ACIR is low: a 45 dB requirement
was adopted.

Due to the small impact of ACLR2 value on system performances, a 5dB
margin was applied on ACLR1: BS ACLR2 = 50 dB.

### 14.1.2 Spectrum mask

#### 14.1.2.1 Spectrum mask for 43 dBm base station output power per carrier

The starting point for defining spectrum mask for UMTS was the FCC Part
24 recommendation, which is summarised in table 14.1.

Table 14.1

  ---------------------------- --------- ----------------------------------------
  Frequency Offset from edge   Level     Measurement bandwidth
  ≤ 1 MHz                      -13 dBm   \> \"-26 dB modulation bandwidth\"/100
  \> 1 MHz                     -13 dBm   1 MHz
  ---------------------------- --------- ----------------------------------------

The UMTS spectrum mask is derived from the one defined by the FCC
specification. The rationales for differences are detailed below:

**- Frequency offset:** in FCC, frequency offset reference is the
allocated band edge. Since spectrum definition has to be independent of
operator allocation, the reference has been changed to the centre
frequency of the measured carrier. Assuming that the nominal carrier
spacing is 5MHz for UMTS, spectrum mask definition starts at 2,5 MHz
offset.

**- Measurement bandwidth:** the \"-26 dB modulation bandwidth\" is
approximately equal to 4,4 MHz. This leads to 44 kHz-measurement
bandwidth. Since this value is not available in most measurement devices
such as spectrum analysers, a standard value of 30 kHz was adopted. The
level has been modified to reflect that change.

**- Mask shape:**

\- a flat region  was defined for the first 200 kHz to take into
account imperfections in baseband modulation. The rationales for 200 kHz
are:

\- this gives sufficient margin to cope with the unwanted spectral
response due to baseband modulation;

\- in case of narrow-band services (using 200 kHz channel raster) in the
adjacent channel, it allows to provide additional protection for the
second narrow-band channel;

\- the shape of the mask defined FCC Part 24 is a step. To reflect more
accurately PA behaviour and to provide some further guarantee on levels
in the adjacent bandwidth, the slope  was introduced in replacement of
the step;

\- the level of the slope  at 3,5 MHz has been set in order to maintain
a monotonic requirement around the 3,5 MHz offset where the measurement
bandwidth changes from 30 kHz to 1 MHz;

\- spectrum mask at offset above 3,5 MHz  and  is equivalent to FCC
part 24 requirement.

Figure 14.1

#### 14.1.2.2 Spectrum masks for other base station output powers

The spectrum masks for other base station output powers were derived
from the mask defined for 43 dBm output power.

##### 14.1.2.2.1 Output power \> 43 dBm

The FCC Part 24 requirement has to be met for any power. Hence, the
spectrum mask defined for 43 dBm is applicable for power above 43 dBm.

##### 14.1.2.2.2 39 dBm ≤ Output power ≤ 43 dBm

The spectrum mask for output power lower than 43 dBm was derived
considering:

\- ACLR1 requirement is 45 dBc;

\- ACLR2 requirement is 50 dBc;

\- overall spectrum specification (spectrum mask and spurious emission)
must be monotonic.

The ACLR values can be estimated from the spectrum mask defined for 43
dBm base station:

\- ACLR1 ≈ 49 dBc;

\- ACLR2 = 50 dBc.

Since ACLR1 has a 4 dB margin, the clauses ,  and  are unchanged when
the power decreases up to 39 dBm (= 43 dBm - 4 dB): at 39 dBm, ACLR1 is
45 dBc.

To comply with ACLR2 requirement, the clause  decreases dB per dB with
the output power.

Figure 14.2

##### 14.1.2.2.3 31 dBm ≤ Output power \< 39 dBm

The spectrum mask defined above for 39 dBm output power complies with
the ACLR1 and ACLR2 requirements. Hence, the overall mask defined for 39
dBm (clauses , ,  and ) decreases dB per dB with the power.

Figure 14.3

##### 14.1.2.2.4 Output Power \< 31 dBm

To take into account the existence of a noise floor in a transmitter,
the mask definition has to reach a limit for low output power. Since the
levels specified in spectrum mask for 31 dBm are low (compared to the
spurious class A level), then this mask is applicable for any power
below 31 dBm.

##### 14.1.2.2.5 Frequency range

In ITU-R specification SM329 \[32\], the frequency limit between out of
band emissions and spurious emissions is defined as 250 % of the
necessary bandwidth. Applying this to UMTS with a 5 MHz necessary
bandwidth lead to 12,5 MHz offset from the carrier frequency.

For low output power base station, the level at offset below 12,5 MHz
(defined by the spectrum mask) are lower than the level of spurious
emissions Category A as defined in ITU-R Recommendation SM.329 \[32\].

To ensure that the transition between spectrum mask specification and
spurious emissions specification keeps the requirements monotonous, it
was decided to extend this 12,5 MHz offset up to the edge of the UMTS
band.

As a result, the level of unwanted emissions at offset greater than 12,5
MHz from the carrier is always lower than or equal to the level of
Category A spurious emissions (-13 dBm/1 MHz).

14.2 Spurious Emissions
-----------------------

### 14.2.1 Mandatory requirements

Two categories of spurious emissions are defined for the base station in
TS 25.104:

\- Category A (clause 6.6.3.1.1) is directly transposed from ITU-R
Recommendation SM.329 \[32\];

\- Category B (clause 6.6.3.1.2): the levels are derived from ITU-R
Recommendation SM.329 \[32\], where category B limits are an example of
more stringent spurious domain emission limits than Category A limits,
based on limits defined and adopted in Europe and used by some other
countries.

The Category B limits in clause 6.6.3.1.2 are based on the limits in
SM.329 \[32\], clause 4.1, 4.3 and Annex 7, with the following
modifications:

\- The transition bandwidth definitions are modified to allow more
protection outside the UMTS band. ITU-R Recommendation SM.329 \[32\]
Category B would allow a transition bandwidth from 12,5 MHz (250 %
necessary bandwidth NB) to 60 MHz (12 x NB) where a reduced measurement
bandwidth is applicable. This transition bandwidth was reduced in UMTS
spurious emissions specification to ensure that the Category B value is
reached at offsets greater than 10MHz from the edges of the operating
band allocated for UMTS services. This will ease co-existence between
adjacent services.

\- There are no steps applied for the reduced measurement bandwidth
inside the operating band. Instead the smallest reduced measurement
bandwidth is applied across the operating band and up to 10 MHz from the
edges. Rationale and analysis of these modified limits is provided below
in subclause 14.2.3. The modification was executed in liaison between
ETSI, 3GPP and ECC \[33\].

### 14.2.2 Regional requirements

#### 14.2.2.1 Co-existence with adjacent services

To further improve protection between services, a slope in the 10 MHz
region on both sides of the UMTS bandwidth may be applicable (clause
6.6.3.6).

#### 14.2.2.2 Co-existence with other systems

Specific spurious requirements are defined for co-existence with GSM 900
(clause 6.6.3.3), DCS1800 (clause 6.6.3.4) and PHS (clause 6.6.3.5). The
values were derived from the requirements of the system under
consideration.

### 14.2.3 Background of Spurious emission limits (Category B)

When the R99 specifications were developed, the limits for spurious and
out-of-band emissions were developed in a liaison activity between 3GPP
and CEPT/ERC TG1. The resulting limits for spurious emissions were
directly transposed from SM.329 \[32\], including the Category B limits
and were included in the 3GPP specifications until the 2006‑12 versions.

A modification of the limits were considered as a result of new
frequency bands being added that gave different boundary conditions for
the limits, plus the work on E-UTRA which also includes flexible RF
bandwidths. This modification of the limits for UTRA is included in the
specifications after 2006-12. After a liaison activity between 3GPP,
ETSI and ECC, the following is concluded about the new limits as
reported in \[33\]:

1\) Compatibility between UTRA and adjacent band services has been
addressed in the relevant CEPT studies, such as ERC Report 065 \[35\].
It is essential that the out-of-band and spurious emission limits used
to demonstrate compatibility for UTRA in those studies are respected.
The new limits do not change any such limits used to demonstrate
adjacent band compatibility, and are thus consistent with ERC Report
065.

2\) The potential impact on the in-band sharing was considered, and it
was concluded that compatibility with existing technologies in the 3G
bands will not be affected by the change. Compatibility for future
similar technologies in the band will also not be affected, since the
new spurious emission limits across the band is identical to the
existing spurious emission limit for UTRA that applies for in-band
compatibility analysis.

3\) It is also noted that the new spurious emission limit can be applied
not only to UTRA, but also to other similar technologies in the UTRA
operating bands. This can give mutual advantages when multiple operators
are deployed in the 3G operating bands. The new limits can from this
aspect be technology neutral and fair between operators, since they do
not depend on technology, carrier bandwidth, number of carriers or the
position of the operator's license block.

It was for these reasons agreed between 3GPP, ETSI and CETPT/ECC that
the new limits can be included in the 3GPP and ETSI specifications.

#### 14.2.3.1 Old Category B spurious emission limits (until 2006-12)

The spurious emission requirements applicable for UTRA base stations
(R99) include as one part the Category B requirements in ITU-R Rec.
SM.329 \[32\]. These requirements as applied to UTRA are illustrated in
Figure 14.4 for two example carrier positions in operating Band I, which
has a downlink band of 2110-2170 MHz. Figure 14.5 shows examples with
two 5 MHz carriers in the band.

NOTE: There is an additional limit in 3GPP specs to protect the services
in the bands adjacent to the BS transmit band as explained in 14.2.2.1,
giving extra protection in the bands immediately adjacent to the
operating band. This additional limit is stricter than the corresponding
Category B limits and is visible as a "slope" outside the operating band
edges in Figure 14.4.

The category B requirements allow for a reduced measurement bandwidth
close to the carrier. This is described for land mobile services in
Annex 7 of \[32\]. The reduced measurement bandwidth is in 3GPP
interpreted as an increase of the spurious emission limit for the base
station in TS 25.104 Category B requirements and applies up to+/- 60 MHz
from the carrier center for UTRA (12 times the necessary bandwidth),
with transition point at +/-50 MHz.

The 3GPP interpretation has however been stricter than the ITU-R
recommendations when applied to UTRA, since the increased spurious
emission limit is only applied in the downlink part of the UMTS
operating band plus an additional 10 MHz on each side of the band as
shown in Figure 14.4 for two example carrier positions. In this band,
the Category B requirements allow an increased limit up to +/ 60 MHz
from the carrier. In 3GPP BS specifications however, the spurious
emissions limit outside of 2100-2180 MHz is always set to the stricter
level of -30 dBm, regardless of the position of the carrier in the band.

For the Band I example in Figure 14.4, where the operating band is 60
MHz wide, the 50 MHz transition point for the \"reduced measurement
bandwidth\" falls *inside* the band at one operating band edge if the
carrier is positioned at the other band edge. It gives a substantial
10dB tightening of the spurious emission requirement for a small part of
the band in this specific case It is also shown in Figure 14.4 that the
tightening does not apply if the carrier is in the middle of the band.
For operating bands II and VII, which are 75 and 70 MHz wide
respectively, the tightened requriement will apply for a larger part of
the operating band. This additional requirement has a considerable
implementation impact, but as shown in subclause 14.2.3.3, it gives no
benefits in terms of improved co-existence with other services in the
band or in adjacent bands.

carriers in two example carrier positions. The dotted red line shows the
limits as in ITU-R SM.329 \[32\].

#### 14.2.3.2 Implications for Evolved UTRA (Long Term Evolution in 3GPP)

For the evolution of UTRA to E-UTRA, the requirements in TR 25.913
\[34\] state that "E-UTRA shall operate in spectrum allocations of
different sizes, including 1.25 MHz, 2.5 MHz, 5 MHz, 10 MHz, 15 MHz and
20 MHz in both the uplink and downlink." Operation with bandwidths other
than 5 MHz will have major implications for the category B limits.

The +/-50 MHz and +/-60 MHz transition points for the Category B limits
are derived as 10 and 12 times the necessary bandwidth respectively for
bands above 1 GHz \[32\]. With a necessary bandwidth varying from
1.25 to 20 MHz for E-UTRA, the transition points between limits will
vary accordingly from 12.5 to 200 MHz and 15 to 240 MHz respectively.
For the bandwidth options 10, 15 and 20 MHz, the transition points would
now always fall outside the operating band as shown in Figure 14.6. It
is not obvious how the widening of the OOB domain should affect the
spurious emission limits immediately outside the band edge.

The limits for the 10 MHz carrier in Figure 14.6 should be compared with
the limits for 2x5 MHz in Figure 14.5. The base station is in both cases
transmitting a wideband 10 MHz signal, but the Category B limits turn
out to be very different.

Figure 14.6 The situation for one 10 MHz E-UTRA carrier in two example
carrier positions. The dotted red line shows the limits as in
ITU-R SM.329 \[32\] for a 10 MHz carrier.

A base station can also transmit a mix of different carrier bandwidths,
e.g. 2x5 + 10 MHz or any other combination of the possible bandwidths.
It then becomes more unclear what the transition points are for the
limits and how the spurious emission limits should apply.

#### 14.2.3.3 New Category B spurious emission limits (after 2006-12)

Because of the implications in different operating bands and for a
variable bandwidth system like E-UTRA, a modification is made to the
spurious emission limits. The limits are based on Category B in ITU-R
Rec. SM.329 \[32\] with the following difference compared to the present
limits:

1\) The -15 dBm limit (corresponding to the reduced measurement BW of
30 kHz in \[32\]) is applied in the spurious domain over the whole
operating band, plus in 10 MHz on each side.

2\) The spurious emission limit inside the operating band is independent
of both the carrier bandwidth(s) and the number of carriers transmitted.

For the 5 MHz bandwidth in today's UTRA specification, point 1) above
will in most cases not make any difference for the limits, unless the
base station transmits one or two isolated carriers at one of the band
edges, as shown in Figure 14.7.

for a single 5 MHz carrier in two example carrier positions. The dotted
red line shows the limits as in ITU-R SM.329 \[32\].

With point 2) above, limits become homogenous over the operating band
independent of carrier bandwidth, the width of the operating band and
the number of carriers. This is shown in Figure 14.8 for a 10 MHz
carrier example. Note that limits for a 2x5 MHz configuration will be
the same as for the 10 MHz example and that the spurious domain limits
in Figure 14.7 and Figure 14.8 are also the same.

for 2x5 MHz carriers in two example carrier positions. The dotted red
line shows the limits as in ITU-R SM.329 \[32\]. Note that the ne
spurious emission limits would be identical for a 10 MHz carrier.

#### 14.2.3.4 Co-existence studies performed for UTRA

During the development of UTRA in 3GPP, the study of limits on unwanted
emissions to facilitate in-band co-existence with other systems has been
one of the major tasks in 3GPP TSG RAN WG4. The methodology used is well
documented in the present document, aiming at repeatable results, full
understanding of the process and mutual agreements between all parties
on how to turn the analysis into useful requirements.

The present document contains a collection of system scenarios,
methodology, parameters, results and studies of UTRA co-existence,
including assumptions and models of cell layout (macro, micro, pico, and
Hierarchical cells), antennas, propagation, mobility, power control,
handoff models and system loading. Co-existence scenarios between UTRA
systems and with other technologies are described, including
step-by-step simulation descriptions. Similar studies are documented in
ECC Report 082 \[36\].

Important aspects of the methodology used in the RAN4 studies are

\- Semi-static simulations of one victim and one aggressor network.

\- Commonly agreed simulation assumptions, scenarios and parameters,
including network layout, propagation models, services used, power
control, radio resource management, interference models, performance
targets, capacity assessment etc.

\- A requirement that at least two (often 4-6) companies contribute to
*each* simulations, in order to verify the validity of the results.

The co-existence studies in the present document and in \[38\] are used
to tailor the unwanted emissions requirements for UTRA, using the
parameter ACIR, which defines the Adjacent Channel Interference Ratio.
UTRA-to-UTRA sharing on adjacent carriers is shown feasible down to ACIR
values of 30 dB for the downlink (see clause 8 of this report). The
corresponding ACLR (Adjacent Channel Leakage ratio) for the base station
was set to 45 dB, i.e. with a 15 dB margin to this value, in order to
not let the base station be the limiting link for co-existence.

The implication is that for the unwanted emissions from a UTRA base
station to have an *adverse* impact on sharing with another system, the
ACLR would have to be close to 30 dB. This corresponds to an unwanted
emission level of +7 dBm/MHz for a UTRA base station transmitting with
43 dBm output power, which is the level assumed in the studies. Note
that this level is *22 dB above* the -15 dBm/MHz spurious emission limit
(Category B) for UTRA.

It should also be noted that the -15 dBm/MHz limit is today the existing
limit across the band for almost all scenarios, and it is not to be
changed. It is for the scenario with a carrier at one band edge, where
the old limit today is -25 or -30 dBm/MHz, that the same -15 dBm/MHz
limit will apply as in the rest of the operating band. From an in-band
sharing point of view, this means that with today's UTRA spurious
emission limits, -15 dBm/MHz is already the level to apply for in-band
sharing between systems and this will not be different with the new
limit.

The studies performed in 3GPP cover sharing between UTRA and other UTRA
systems, GSM and cdma2000. This includes systems with bandwidths ranging
from 200 kHz to 5 MHz. Present sharing studies ongoing in 3GPP for the
Evolution of UTRA include also 10 MHz systems (flexible bandwidth).

It would be reasonable to assume that the results of the co-existence
studies performed for UTRA could to a large extent be applied also for
in-band sharing with systems of similar bandwidths and RF properties
under similar scenarios. Considering the very large margin of more than
20 dB between the limit of ‑15 dBm/MHz and the level where studies show
an adverse impact from BS emissions on a victim system in the band, an
adverse effect on the in-band sharing between UTRA and future
technologies in the UTRA bands is very unlikely.

15 Link Level performances
==========================

15.1 Propagation Models
-----------------------

### 15.1.1 Rationale for the choice of multipath fading Case 2

Propagation conditions are used to derive performance measurements in
static conditions or multi-path fading environment.

In the following the rationale for the choice of multi-path fading
called \"Case 2\" is described.

Propagation condition \"Case 2\" is aimed at testing the receiver under
high delay spread conditions. It contains 3 taps that for FDD are spread
over 20 μs and for TDD over 12 μs. The choice is a trade-off between the
delay spread performance desired, the resulting receiver performance and
the complexity imposed on the receiver.

From a practical point of view, this scenario will be very infrequently
encountered in reality, since it is an extreme case. For FDD however,
the 20 μs tap does not give an unreasonable complexity or performance
impact and is therefore included in the propagation conditions. Also,
for FDD an extra \"margin\" in the propagation delay requirement may be
needed to give efficient support of repeaters, since repeaters introduce
additional delay.

Although TDD is also designed to work under such conditions, it has been
concluded not to test all devices with a 20 μs tap. In this extreme case
TDD will work, but not without either degraded performance, reduced
capacity, and/or increased receiver complexity. It is also not expected
that TDD will support repeaters. For these reasons, a \"Case 2\" for TDD
has been chosen with 12 μs delay for the last tap.

15.2 Simulation results for UE TDD performance test

### 15.2.2 Downlink Simulation results and discussion

Simulations were performed for the 12,2 kbps, 64 kbps, 144 kbps and 384
kbps measurement channels. Propagation conditions were AWGN, Case 1,
Case 2 and Case 3. Two different receiver architecture were used in the
simulations, a conventional RAKE receiver and a Joint-Detector receiver
with a zero forcing algorithm (ZF-BLE).

The results for the 12,2 kbps measurement channel with RAKE receiver
structure were already presented at the last meeting. They are repeated
here for convenience. The simulations for Case 2 were redone, because
the propagation model was changed at the last meeting.

The results for the RAKE receiver in the static case (AWGN) were
compared to the FDD-mode results for the 12,2 kbps channel in Tdoc
R4-99739 and the results agreed very well. For the other measurement
channels, the coding schemes differ. In this case no direct comparison
from FDD-mode to TDD-mode can be drawn. Thus, no further benchmarking
results are presented.

Because a margin due to real channel estimation is more difficult to
determine for a joint detector than for a RAKE receiver, real channel
estimation was used in the simulations of the joint detector receiver.
Due to this, the Joint‑Detector results are slightly worse compared to
ideal channel estimation. This can be observed especially under static
conditions (AWGN), where the same results are expected for RAKE and
Joint-Detector.

The simulation results for Î~or~/I~oc~ in dB are summarised in table
15.3.

In general, the values obtained by the RAKE receiver are proposed.
However, for the high date rate services (144 kbps and 384 kbps) the
RAKE receiver and Joint-Detector differ significantly in some cases (384
kbps Case 1 with BLER 10E-2 and 384 kbps Case 3 with BLER 10E-3) or the
BLER target can not be reached with a RAKE receiver (144 kbps Case 3
with BLER 10E-2 and BLER 10E-3). If the results for the two receivers
differ by more than 3 dB, the value obtained from the Joint-Detector
plus additional 3 dB margin is proposed.

### 15.2.4 Uplink Simulation results and discussion

Simulations were performed for the 12,2 kbps, 64 kbps, 144 kbps and 384
kbps measurement channels. Propagation conditions were AWGN, Case 1,
Case 2 and Case 3. A joint-detector receiver with a zero forcing
algorithm (ZF-BLE) and real channel estimation was used in the
simulations.

No direct comparison from FDD-mode to TDD-mode can be drawn, because of
the different modulation scheme and coding. Thus, no benchmarking
results are presented.

The simulation results for Î~or~/I~oc~ in dB are summarised in table
15.6.

15.3 Simulation results for UE FDD performance test
---------------------------------------------------

### 15.3.1 BTFD performance simulation

#### 15.3.1.1 Introduction

Blind Transport format Detection (BTFD) is a technique that UE estimate
the Transport Formats of Downlink channels without TFCI bits. The
followings are simulation results for BTFD performance.

#### 15.3.1.2 Assumption

Table 15.7 shows the simulation assumptions of this simulation. Another
assumptions are defined as follows:

\- 9 diferent Transport Format Combinations (table 15.8) are informed
during the call set up procedure, so that UE have to detect correct
transport format from this 9 candidates;

\- reference measurement channels defined in annex A.4 of TS 25.101
\[1\] are used in this simulation.

Moreover, it is pointed out that \"Even if CRC check result is O.K., UE
might detect false Transport Format\", and proposed to regard this case
as Block Error. It is obvious that the fault detection of transport
format causes significant degradation to the service quality (e.g. AMR
speech glitch). Therefore it should be evaluate the probability of these
cases independently. In order to evaluate it, both BLER and FDR (False
Transport Format Detection Ratio) are defined and evaluated in this
simulation. The definitions of BLER and FDR are as follows:

\- BLER: the probability of CRC check result is N.G;

\- FDR: the probability that UE detect false transport format even CRC
check is O.K.

Considering the FDR, the additional CRC parity bit length was specified
to achieve, the better Transport Format detection performance in UE.
(this study has shown in detail in Tdoc R1-99c54). Since 16bit CRC
provides very good FDR performance (FDR=\~1E-6), it has less necessity
to evaluate such a good performance of rate detection. Besides the
testing point of view, to test higher probability with higher confidence
needs longer testing time. Therefore it is used CRC = 12bit in the
reference measurement channels.

#### 15.3.1.3 Simulation results

Figure 15.1, figure 15.2 and figure 15.3 are simulation results for BTFD
in case of static condition. Figure 15.4, figure 15.5 and figure 15.6
are results in case of multi-path fading condition case 3.

Every events are distinguish as in table 15.9.

Event (A) is a normal received case, and Event (D) can ignore because
occurrence probability is below 1E-5. Simulation results are shown by
three curves. Each curve is defined as follows:

\- BLER(CUN) is BLock Error Ratio calculated on the simulation. It can
be defined as following formula:

BLER(CUN) = {(D)+(E)+(F)+(G)} / total\_frame;

\- BLER(PRAC) is BLock Error Ratio measured in the test. Because, in the
test, whether the Block Error is correct or not can be distinguished
only from CRC check result. It can be defined as following formula:

BLER(PRAC) = {(C)+(F)+(G)} / total\_frame;

\- FDR is False transport format Detection Ratio. It can be defined as
following formula:

FDR = {(B)+(E)} / total\_frame.

Both BLER(CUN) and BLER(PRAC) can regard almost same from the following
simulation result, therefore it is possible to evaluate BLER correctly
in the test.

Simulation is performed to have 500 000 Blocks for all cases.

#### 15.3.1.4 Conclusion

From these simulation results, the value of DPCH\_Ec/Ior on BLER = 1 %
can be had. It can be decided specification values of DPCH\_Ec/Ior with
appropriate implementation margin. It is proposed the implementation
margins 2 dB for static case, and 3dB for case 3 (same as the case using
TFCI). It is because that there are no additional factor compare with
the case using TFCI).

Additionally, from the results FDR can achieve below 10^-4^ on the point
of BLER = 10^-2^ in all cases. So it can be specified that FDR should
not exceed 10^-4^ on this DPCH\_Ec/Ior value.

15.4 Simulation results for compressed mode
-------------------------------------------

### 15.4.1 Simulation assumptions for compressed mode by spreading factor reduction

The link performance of a physical channel in compressed mode is
simulated. The compressed mode reference pattern is as defined in table
15.11 and the other link simulation parameters as defined in table 15.12
are used. The power control is on and the results give the probability
distribution of the envelope when BLER target is set to 0,01. The
compressed mode off shows the same results as the static performance of
the downlink power control.

Measurements of$\ \frac{\text{Tx}\ \text{DPCH}_{}}{I_{\text{or}}}$ and
block error ratio (BLER) starts after 600 TTI\'s when the power
controller is assumed to perform at the BLER-target. Sampling then
continues for 10 000 TTI´s before simulation stops.

### 15.4.2 Simulation results for compressed mode by spreading factor reduction

#### 15.4.2.1 Summary of performance results

The simulation results presented in this clause show that average
downlink power is not really affected by the compressed mode, which is
related to the interference level in the system. However the variance of
the transmitted power is increased, in this case the required additional
downlink power is less than 1,5 dB to 1,6 dB for 90 % to 95 % of the
samples (in time). This result is valid for all lengths of the time
gaps. It seems the loss of power control due to the compressed gaps does
not increase with a longer gap. The compressed mode pattern in this case
is quite extreme, having 7 slot gaps every double frame.
