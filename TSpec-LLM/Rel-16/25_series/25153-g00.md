3 Definitions, symbols and abbreviations
========================================

3.1 Definitions
---------------

For the purposes of the present document, the following terms and
definitions apply:

**Donor coupling loss:** is the coupling loss between the repeater and
the donor base station.

**Down-link:** signal path where base station transmits and mobile
receives

**Maximum output power, Pmax:** This is the mean power level per carrier
measured at the antenna connector of the Repeater in specified reference
condition.

**Pass band:** the Repeater can have one or several pass bands. The pass
band is the frequency range that the Repeater operates in with
operational configuration. This frequency range can correspond to one or
several consecutive nominal 5 MHz channels. If they are not consecutive
each subset of channels shall be considered as an individual pass band.

**Repeater:** a device that receives, amplifies and transmits the
radiated or conducted RF carrier both in the down-link direction (from
the base station to the mobile area) and in the up-link direction (from
the mobile to the base station).

**Up-link:** signal path where mobile transmits and base station
receives.

3.2 Symbols
-----------

For the purposes of the present document, the following symbols apply:

BW~Channel~ Channel bandwidth

BW~Config~ Transmission bandwidth configuration, expressed in MHz.

BW~Meas~ Measurement bandwidth

BW~Signal~ Bandwidth of the repeater input signal filling the repeater
pass band

F~DL\_low~ The lowest frequency of the downlink operating band

F~DL\_high~ The highest frequency of the downlink operating band

F~UL\_low~ The lowest frequency of the uplink operating band

F~UL\_high~ The highest frequency of the uplink operating band

f\_offset\_PB Distance from the channel edge frequency of the first or
last channel in the pass band

N~DL~ Downlink LARFCN

N~Offs-DL~ Offset used for calculating downlink LARFCN

N~Offs-UL~ Offset used for calculating uplink LARFCN

N~RB~ Transmission bandwidth configuration, expressed in units of
resource blocks

N~UL~ Uplink LARFCN

Pmax Maximum output power

Pout Output power

3.3 Abbreviations
-----------------

For the purposes of the present document, the following abbreviations
apply:

BTS Base Transceiver Station

CW Continuous Wave (unmodulated signal)

EVM Error Vector Magnitude

FDD Frequency Division Duplex

FFS For Further Study

IMT2000 International Mobile Telecommunication-2000

4 Frequency bands and channel arrangement
=========================================

4.1 Frequency bands
-------------------

UTRA/TDD is designed to operate in the following bands;

a\) 1900 - 1920 MHz: Uplink and downlink transmission

2010 - 2025 MHz Uplink and downlink transmission

b\) 1850 - 1910 MHz Uplink and downlink transmission

1930 - 1990 MHz Uplink and downlink transmission

c\) 1910 - 1930 MHz Uplink and downlink transmission

d\) 2570 - 2620 MHz Uplink and downlink transmission

e\) 2300 - 2400 MHz Uplink and downlink transmission

f\) 1880 - 1920 MHz: Uplink and downlink transmission

Note: Deployment in existing and other frequency bands is not precluded.

4.2 TX-RX frequency separation
------------------------------

No TX-RX frequency separation is required as Time Division Duplex (TDD)
is employed. Each subframe consists of 7 main timeslots where all main
timeslots (at least the first one) before the single switching point are
allocated DL and all main timeslots (at least the last one) after the
single switching point are allocated UL.

4.3 Channel arrangement
-----------------------

### 4.3.1 Channel spacing

The channel spacing is 1.6MHz, but this can be adjusted to optimise
performance in a particular deployment scenario.

### 4.3.2 Channel raster

The channel raster is 200 kHz for all bands, which means that the
carrier frequency must be a multiple of 200 kHz.

### 4.3.3 Channel number

The carrier frequency is designated by the UTRA absolute radio frequency
channel number (UARFCN). The value of the UARFCN in the IMT2000 band is
defined in the general case as follows:

N~t~ = 5 ∗ F 0.0 ≤ F ≤ 3276.6 MHz

where F is the carrier frequency in MHz.

5 General test conditions and declarations
==========================================

This specification applies only to LCR TDD Repeater.

The requirements of this clause apply to all applicable tests in this
specification. Many of the tests in this specification measure a
parameter relative to a value, that is not fully specified in the LCR
TDD specifications. For these tests, the Minimum Requirement is
determined relative to a nominal value specified by the manufacturer.

Some requirements for the Repeater may be regional as listed in
subClause 5.6.

When specified in a test, the manufacturer shall declare the nominal
value of a parameter, or whether an option is supported.

Schematic drawings for the individual measurement set-up can be found in
the Annex A.

5.1 Acceptable uncertainty of Test System
-----------------------------------------

The maximum acceptable uncertainty of the Test System is specified below
for each test, where appropriate. The Test System shall enable the
stimulus signals in the test case to be adjusted to within the specified
tolerance, and the equipment under test to be measured with an
uncertainty not exceeding the specified values. All tolerances and
uncertainties are absolute values, and are valid for a confidence level
of 95 %, unless otherwise stated.

A confidence level of 95% is the measurement uncertainty tolerance
interval for a specific measurement that contains 95% of the performance
of a population of test equipment.

For RF test it should be noted that the uncertainties in subClause 5.1
apply to the Test System operating into a nominal 50 ohm load and do not
include system effects due to mismatch between the DUT and the Test
System.

### 5.1.1 Measurements of test environments

The measurement accuracy of the Repeater test environments defined in
SubClause 5.4, Test environments shall be.

> Pressure: ± 5 kPa.
>
> Temperature: ± 2 degrees.
>
> Relative Humidity: ± 5 %.
>
> DC Voltage: ± 1,0 %.
>
> AC Voltage: ± 1,5 %.
>
> Vibration: 10 %.

Vibration frequency: 0,1 Hz.

The above values shall apply unless the test environment is otherwise
controlled and the specification for the control of the test environment
specifies the uncertainty for the parameter.

5.2 Repeater test tolerances (informative)
------------------------------------------

The Test Tolerances defined in this subclause have been used to relax
the Minimum Requirements in this specification to derive the Test
Requirements.

The Test Tolerances are derived from Test System uncertainties,
regulatory requirements and criticality to system performance. As a
result, the Test Tolerances may sometimes be set to zero.

The test tolerances should not be modified for any reason e.g. to take
account of commonly known test system errors (such as mismatch, cable
loss, etc.)

5.3 Interpretation of measurement results
-----------------------------------------

The measurement results returned by the Test System are compared -
without any modification - against the Test Requirements as defined by
the shared risk principle.

The Shared Risk principle is defined in ETR 273 Part 1 sub-part 2
section 6.5.

The actual measurement uncertainty of the Test System for the
measurement of each parameter shall be included in the test report.

The recorded value for the Test System uncertainty shall be, for each
measurement, equal to or lower than the appropriate figure in subClause
5.1 of this specification.

If the Test System for a test is known to have a measurement uncertainty
greater than that specified in subClause 5.1, it is still permitted to
use this equipment provided that an adjustment is made as follows:

Any additional uncertainty in the Test System over and above that
specified in subClause 5.1 shall be used to tighten the Test Requirement
- making the test harder to pass.

This procedure will ensure that a Test System not compliant with
subClause 4.1 does not increase the chance of passing a device under
test where that device would otherwise have failed the test if a Test
System compliant with subClause 4.1 had been used.

5.4 Test Environment
--------------------

For each test in the present document, the environmental conditions
under which the Repeater is to be tested are defined.

### 5.4.1 Normal test environment

When a normal test environment is specified for a test, the test should
be performed under any combination of conditions between the minimum and
maximum limits stated in table 5.3.

Table 5.3: Limits of conditions for Normal Test Environment

  --------------------- ------------------------------------------ ---------
  Condition             Minimum                                    Maximum
  Barometric pressure   86 kPa                                     106 kPa
  Temperature           15°C                                       30°C
  Relative Humidity     20 %                                       85 %
  Power supply          Nominal, as declared by the manufacturer   
  Vibration             Negligible                                 
  --------------------- ------------------------------------------ ---------

The ranges of barometric pressure, temperature and humidity represent
the maximum variation expected in the uncontrolled environment of a test
laboratory. If it is not possible to maintain these parameters within
the specified limits, the actual values shall be recorded in the test
report.

NOTE: This may, for instance, be the case for measurements of radiated
emissions performed on an open field test site.

### 5.4.2 Extreme test environment

The manufacturer shall declare one of the following:

a\) The equipment class for the equipment under test, as defined in IEC
60721-3-3 \[2\].

b\) The equipment class for the equipment under test, as defined in IEC
60721-3-4 \[3\].

c\) For equipment that does not comply to the mentioned classes, the
relevant classes from IEC 60 721 documentation for Temperature, Humidity
and Vibration shall be declared.

NOTE: Reduced functionality for conditions that fall out side of the
standard operational conditions are not tested in this TS. These may be
stated and tested separately.

#### 5.4.2.1 Extreme temperature

When an extreme temperature test environment is specified for a test,
the test shall be performed at the standard minimum and maximum
operating temperatures defined by the manufacturer\'s declaration for
the equipment under test.

**Minimum temperature:**

\- The test shall be performed with the environmental test equipment and
methods of inducing the required environmental phenomena into the
equipment, conforming to the test procedure of IEC 60 068‑2‑1 \[4\],
Environmental Testing, Part 2: Tests ‑ Tests A: Cold. The equipment
shall be maintained at the stabilized condition for the duration of the
test sequence.

**Maximum temperature:**

\- The test shall be performed with the environmental test equipment and
methods of inducing the required environmental phenomena in to the
equipment, conforming to the test procedure of IEC 60 068‑2‑2 \[5\]
(Environmental Testing, Part 2: Tests ‑ Tests Bd Dry heat). The
equipment shall be maintained at the stabilized condition for the
duration of the test sequence.

NOTE: It is recommended that the equipment is made fully operational
prior to the equipment being taken to its lower operating temperature.

### 5.4.3 Vibration

When vibration conditions are specified for a test, the test shall be
performed while the equipment is subjected to a vibration sequence as
defined by the manufacturers declaration for the equipment under test.
This shall use the environmental test equipment and methods of inducing
the required environmental phenomena in to the equipment, conforming to
the test procedure of IEC 60 068‑2‑6 \[8\], Environmental Testing, Part
2: Tests ‑ Test Fc and guidance: Vibration (Sinusoidal). Other
environmental conditions shall be within the ranges specified in
subClause 4.4.1, Normal test environment.

NOTE: The higher levels of vibration may induce undue physical stress in
to equipment after a prolonged series of tests. The testing body should
only vibrate the equipment during the RF measurement process.

### 5.4.4 Power supply

When extreme power supply conditions are specified for a test, the test
shall be performed at the standard upper and lower limits of operating
voltage defined by the manufacturer\'s declaration for the equipment
under test.

**Upper voltage limit**

\- The equipment shall be supplied with a voltage equal to the upper
limit declared by the manufacturer (as measured at the input terminals
to the equipment). The tests shall be carried out at a steady state
minimum and maximum limit declared by the manufacturer for the
equipment, to the methods described in IEC 60 068‑2‑1 \[4\] Test Ab/Ad:
Cold and IEC 60 068‑2‑2 \[5\] Test Bb/Bd: Dry Heat.

**Lower voltage limit**

\- The equipment shall be supplied with a voltage equal to the lower
limit declared by the manufacturer (as measured at the input terminals
to the equipment). The tests shall be carried out at a steady state
minimum and maximum limit declared by the manufacturer for the
equipment, to the methods described in IEC 60 068‑2‑1 \[4\] Test Ab/Ad:
Cold and IEC 60 068‑2‑2 \[5\] Test Bb/Bd: Dry Heat.

5.5 Selection of configurations for testing
-------------------------------------------

Measurements shall be performed within the time slots under test as
specified individually for each test within the subclause \" Procedure
\".

Most tests in this TS are only performed for a subset of the possible
combinations of test conditions. For instance:

‑ Only one RF channel may be specified to be tested.

‑ Only one timeslot may be specified to be tested.

When a test is performed by a test laboratory, the choice of which
combinations are to be tested shall be specified by the laboratory. The
laboratory may consult with operators, the manufacturer or other bodies.

When a test is performed by a manufacturer, the choice of which
combinations are to be tested may be specified by an operator.

5.6 Regional requirements
-------------------------

Some requirements in TS 25.153 may only apply in certain regions. Table
5.4 lists all requirements that may be applied differently in different
regions.

5.8 Repeater configurations
---------------------------

### 5.8.1 Power supply options

If the repeater is supplied with a number of different power supply
configurations, it may not be necessary to test RF parameters for each
of the power supply options, provided that it can be demonstrated that
the range of conditions over which the equipment is tested is at least
as great as the range of conditions due to any of the power supply
configurations.

### 5.8.2 Combining of Repeaters

If the repeater is intended for combination with additional apparatus
connected to a repeater port and this combination is supplied as a
system, the combination of repeater together with the additional
apparatus shall also fulfil the repeater requirements. E.g. if the
repeater is intended for combination such that multiple repeaters
amplify the same signals into the same ports the combination shall also
fulfil the repeater requirements.

An example of such a configuration is shown in figure 5.1

Figure 5.1: Example of repeater configuration

6 Output power
==============

Output power, Pout, of the repeater is the mean power of one carrier at
maximum repeater gain delivered to a load with resistance equal to the
nominal load impedance of the transmitter.

Rated output power, PRAT, of the repeater is the mean power level per
carrier at maximum repeater gain that the manufacturer has declared to
be available at the antenna connector.

6.1 Definition and applicability
--------------------------------

Maximum output power, Pmax, of the repeater is the mean power level per
carrier measured at the antenna connector in specified reference
condition.

6.2 Minimum Requirements
------------------------

The requirements shall apply at maximum gain, with LCR TDD signals in
the pass band of the repeater, at levels that produce the maximum rated
output power per channel.

When the power of all signals is increased by 10 dB, compared to the
power level that produce the maximum rated output power, the
requirements shall still be met.

In normal conditions, the Repeater maximum output power shall remain
within limits specified in Table 6.1 relative to the manufacturer\'s
rated output power.

input port of the Repeater. The power level of the RF input signal shall
be at least 5 dB below the power level which, when applied within the
pass band, would produce the maximum rated output power, as declared by
the manufacturer. This is to ensure that the equipment is operating in
the linear output range.

9.2 Spurious emissions
----------------------

### 9.2.1 Definition and applicability

Spurious emissions are emissions which are caused by unwanted
transmitter effects such as harmonics emission, parasitic emission,
intermodulation products and frequency conversion products, but exclude
out of band emissions. This is measured at the base station RF output
port.

The requirements shall apply whatever the type of transmitter considered
(single carrier or multi carrier). It applies for all transmission modes
foreseen by the manufacturer's.

For 1.28 Mcps TDD option, either requirement applies at frequencies
within the specified frequency ranges which are more than 4 MHz under
the first carrier frequency used or more than 4 MHz above the last
carrier frequency used.

Unless otherwise stated, all requirements are measured as mean power.

### 9.2.2 Minimum Requirements

10 Modulation accuracy
======================

10.1 Error Vector Magnitude
---------------------------

### 10.1.1 Definition and applicability

The modulation accuracy is defined by the Error Vector Magnitude (EVM),
which is a measure of the difference between the theoretical waveform
and a modified version of the measured waveform. This difference is
called the error vector. The measured waveform is modified by first
passing it through a matched root raised cosine filter with bandwidth
1.28MHz and roll-off α=0.22. The waveform is then further modified by
selecting the frequency, absolute phase, absolute amplitude and chip
clock timing so as to minimise the error vector. The EVM result is
defined as root of the ratio of the mean error vector power to the mean
reference signal power expressed as a %.

The measurement interval is one power control group (timeslot). The
repeater shall operate with an ideal LCR TDD signal in the pass band of
the repeater at a level, which produce the maximum rated output power
per channel, as specified by the manufacturer.

### 10.1.2 Minimum requirements

The Error Vector Magnitude shall not be worse than 8 %.

### 10.1.3 Test purpose

To verify that the EVM is within the limit specified in 10.1.2 after the
signal passed through the Repeater..

### 10.1.4 Method of test

#### 10.1.4.1 Initial conditions

1\) Set-up the equipment as shown in annex A.

2\) Connect the signal generator equipment to the Repeater input port.

3\) Connect the signal analyser to the Repeater output port..

#### 10.1.4.2 Procedure

1\) Set the signal generator to transmit one signal according to table
10.1.

10.1.4.2 shall not exceed 8 %.

10.2 Peak code domain error
---------------------------

### 10.2.1 Definition and applicability

The code domain error is computed by projecting the error vector power
onto the code domain at a specific spreading factor. The error power for
each code is defined as the ratio to the mean power of the reference
waveform expressed in dB. And the Peak Code Domain Error is defined as
the maximum value for Code Domain Error. The measurement interval is one
timeslot.

### 10.2.2 Minimum requirement

The peak code domain error shall not exceed -30 dB at spreading factor
16.

### 10.2.3 Test purpose

To verify that the peak code domain error is within the limit specified
in 10.2.2 after the signal passed through the Repeater.

### 10.2.5 Test requirements

The peak code domain error measured according to subclause 10.2.4.2
shall not exceed -30 dB at spreading factor 16.

11 Input Intermodulation
========================

The input intermodulation is a measure of the capability of the repeater
to inhibit the generation of interference in the pass band, in the
presence of interfering signals on frequencies other than the pass band.

11.1 Definition and applicability
---------------------------------

Third and higher order mixing of the two interfering RF signals can
produce an interfering signal in the band of the desired channel.
Intermodulation response rejection is a measure of the capability of the
Repeater to maintain the wanted frequency free of internally created
interference.

This test applies to uplink and downlink path of the Repeater.

11.2 Minimum requirement
------------------------

### 11.2.1 General requirement

For the parameters specified in table 11.1, the power in the pass band
shall not increase with more than 10 dB at the output of the repeater as
measured in the centre of the pass band, compared to the level obtained
without interfering signals applied.

The frequency separation between the two interfering signals shall be
adjusted so that the 3^rd^ order intermodulation product is positioned
in the centre of the pass band.

Table 11.1 specifies the parameters for two interfering signals, where:

\- f~1~ offset is the offset from the channel edge frequency of the
first or last channel in the pass band of the closer carrier.

Table 11.1: Input intermodulation requirement

  ------------- --------------------------- ----------------- -----------------------
  f~1~ offset   Interfering Signal Levels   Type of signals   Measurement bandwidth
  1,0 MHz       -40 dBm                     2 CW carriers     1 MHz
  ------------- --------------------------- ----------------- -----------------------

### 11.2.2 Co-location with BS in other systems

This additional input intermodulation requirement may be applied for the
protection of TDD Repeater input when GSM900, DCS1800, PCS1900, GSM850,
UTRA FDD, UTRA TDD and/or E-UTRA BS are co-located with an LCR TDD
Repeater.

Unless otherwise stated this requirement applies to the uplink and
downlink of the repeater, at maximum gain.

For the parameters specified in table 11.2, the power in the pass band
shall not increase with more than 10 dB at the output of the repeater as
measured in the centre of the pass band, compared to the level obtained
without interfering signals applied.

The frequency separation between the two interfering signals shall be
adjusted so that the lowest order intermodulation product is positioned
in the centre of the pass band.

NOTE 1: The lowest intermodulation products correspond to the 4^th^ and
3^rd^ order for the GSM 900 and DCS 1800 bands, respectively.

NOTE 1: The co-location requirements in Table 11.2 do not apply when the
repeaters pass band frequency range is adjacent to the band for the
co-location requirement in the Table 11.2. The current state-of-the-art
technology does not allow a single generic solution for co-location with
other system on adjacent frequencies for 30dB Repeater-BS minimum
coupling loss. However, there are certain site-engineering solutions
that can be used. These techniques are addressed in TR 25.942 \[13\].

NOTE 2: The Table 11.2 assumes that two operating bands, where the
corresponding transmit and receive frequency ranges would be
overlapping, are not deployed in the same geographical area. For such a
case of operation with overlapping frequency arrangements in the same
geographical area, special co-location requirements may apply that are
not covered by the 3GPP specifications.

### 11.2.3 Co-existence with other systems

This additional input intermodulation requirement may be applied when
GSM900, DCS1800, PCS1900, GSM850, UTRA FDD, UTRA TDD and/or E-UTRA BS
operating in another frequency band co-exist with an E-UTRA FDD
Repeater.

Unless otherwise stated this requirement applies to the uplink and
downlink of the repeater, at maximum gain.

For the parameters specified in table 11.3, the power in the pass band
shall not increase with more than 10 dB at the output of the repeater as
measured in the centre of the pass band, compared to the level obtained
without interfering signals applied.

The frequency separation between the two interfering signals shall be
adjusted so that the lowest order intermodulation product is positioned
in the centre of the pass band.

NOTE 1: The lowest intermodulation products correspond to the 4^th^ and
3^rd^ order for the GSM 900 and DCS 1800 bands, respectively.

in co-existing other systems

NOTE 1: The co-existence requirements in Table 11.3 do not apply when
the repeaters pass band frequency range is adjacent to the band for the
co-existence requirement in the Table 11.3. The current state-of-the-art
technology does not allow a single generic solution for co-existence.

NOTE 2: The Table 11.3 assumes that two operating bands, where the
frequency ranges would be overlapping, are not deployed in the same
geographical area. For such a case of operation with overlapping
frequency arrangements in the same geographical area, special
co-existence requirements may apply that are not covered by the 3GPP
specifications.

11.3 Test purpose
-----------------

The purpose of this test is to verify that the Repeater meets the
intermodulation characteristics requirements as specified by the minimum
requirements.

11.4 Method of test
-------------------

### 11.4.1 Initial conditions

1\) A measurement system set-up is shown in annex A.

2\) Set the Repeater to maximum gain.

3\) Connect two signal generators with a combining circuit or one signal
generator with the ability to generate several CW carriers to the input.

4\) Connect a spectrum analyser to the output of the Repeater. Set the
resolution bandwidth to 1 MHz in the centre of the pass band. Set
averaging to 1 second or more.

### 11.4.2 Procedure

1\) Adjust the frequency of the input signals, either below or above the
pass band, so that one carrier, f~1~, is 1 MHz outside the channel edge
frequency of the first or last channel in the pass band, and the lowest
order intermodulation product from the two carriers is positioned in the
centre of the pass band, according to subclause 11.2.

2\) Take the measurement of the rise of the output signal.

3\) Repeat the measurement for the opposite path of the Repeater.

11.5 Test requirements
----------------------

The Input intermodulation measured according to subclause 11.4.2 shall
not exceed the limits specified in the relevant tables of 11.2.

12 Output Intermodulation
=========================

The transmit intermodulation performance is a measure of the capability
of the transmitter to inhibit the generation of signals in its non
linear elements caused by presence of the wanted signal and an
interfering signal reaching the transmitter via the antenna.

12.1 Definition and applicability
---------------------------------

The transmit intermodulation level is the power of the intermodulation
products when a LCR TDD modulated interference signal is injected into
the antenna connector at a mean power level of 30 dB lower than that of
the mean power of the subject signal.

The requirement is applicable for downlink signals.

12.2 Minimum requirements
-------------------------

The frequency of the interference signal shall be ±1.6 MHz, ±3.2 MHz and
±4.8 MHz offset from the subject signal. The Transmit intermodulation
level shall not exceed the out of band or the spurious emission
requirements of section 9.1 and 9.2.

12.3 Test purpose
-----------------

The test purpose is to verify the ability of the repeater to restrict
the generation of intermodulation products in the presence of a subject
signal on the repeater input and output ports, and an interfering signal
applied at the repeater output port.

12.4 Method of test
-------------------

### 12.4.1 Initial conditions

1\) A measurement system set-up is shown in annex A.

2\) Connect a signal generator to the input port of the Repeater (wanted
signal). Connect a signal generator to the circulator on the output port
(interfering signal) and make sure the signal generator power is
directed to the repeater output port.

> 3\) Detection mode: True RMS.

### 12.4.2 Procedures

1\) Set the Repeater to maximum gain.

2\) Set the signal generator at the repeater input port (subject signal)
to generate a signal in accordance to table 12.1, at the level which
produce the manufacturer specified maximum output power at maximum gain.

######## Annex B (informative): Derivation of Test Requirements

The Test Requirements in this specification have been calculated by
relaxing the Minimum Requirements of the core specification using the
Test Tolerances defined in subclause 4.2. When the Test Tolerance is
zero, the Test Requirement will be the same as the Minimum Requirement.
When the Test Tolerance is non-zero, the Test Requirements will differ
from the Minimum Requirements, and the formula used for this relaxation
is given in table B.1.

Table B.1: Derivation of Test Requirements

######## Annex C (informative): Acceptable uncertainty of Test Equipment

This informative annex specifies the critical parameters of the
components of an overall Test System (e.g. signal generators, signal
analysers etc.) which are necessary when assembling a Test System which
complies with subclause5.1 Acceptable uncertainty of Test System. These
Test Equipment parameters are fundamental to the accuracy of the overall
Test System and are unlikely to be improved upon through System
Calibration.
