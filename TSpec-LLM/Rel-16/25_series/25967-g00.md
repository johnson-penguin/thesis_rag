1 Scope
=======

This document is a technical report which was requested in the Objective
2 of the RAN4 work item description "FDD Home NodeB RF requirements"
\[5\]. The goal of this technical report is to describe the agreed
approach towards the RF related issues raised in \[5\]:

**A)** The existing UTRA BS classes did not fully address the RF
requirements of the HNB application. Proposals for changes to radio
performance requirement specifications TS 25.104 are therefore provided
in this report, together with the proposals for the test specification
TS 25.141. Most of the HNB-specific additions to TS 25.104 / 25.141 were
accommodated in a manner similar to the other BS classes.

Editors note:

\- Where square bracketed values are suggested in 3GPP TR 25.820, to
conduct further work as required to agree appropriate values.

\- Where it is suggested that performance values in 3GPP TS 25.104 may
be subject to change to conduct further work as required to see if this
is necessary.

**B)** The report intends to ensure that operators are provided with
sufficient information to fully understand the issues concerning the
deployment of HNBs:

\- Deployment scenarios and their potential bottlenecks.

\- Guidance on how to control the interference to surrounding macro
networks and provide good coverage for the HNB

\- Testing of the HNB.

4 General
=========

As agreed in the work item proposal \[1\]:

Within the course of increasing UMTS terminal penetration and
fixed-mobile convergence, an upcoming demand for 3G Home NodeBs is
observed to provide attractive services and data rates in *home
environments*.

UTRAN is not optimally suited for this application as UTRAN was
developed and defined under the assumption of coordinated network
deployment, whereas Home NodeBs are typically associated with
uncoordinated and large scale deployment.

Aim of this work item is to amend the UTRAN NodeB related RF
specifications to support the Home NodeBs application. No changes to the
UE RF specifications are foreseen.

The scope of this work item is limited to the UTRA FDD mode.

4.1 Task description
--------------------

### 4.1.1 HNB class definition

The purpose of this work is to update the radio performance requirement
specification TS 25.104, further work required to agree on *new
parameter values will be documented in the TR and the updates required
in test specification TS 25.141 will be documented.*

### 4.1.2 HNB measurements and adaptation 

The purpose of this work item is to ensure that operators have necessary
information about how to adjust the output transmission power of HNB as
a function of the signal strength from the macro cell layer, and/or from
other HNBs, in order to enhance overall system performance.

In order to achieve this, (at least) the following areas should be
addressed:

1\) Guidance on how to control HNB power

a\. The intention is to provide guidance to operators on possible
strategies and expected performance in typical exemplary deployment
scenarios.

b\. Is it possible to have the same mechanism to control HNB output
power with respect to the macro cell layer, other surrounding HNBs, and
in the case of HNB coverage control for open access HNB.

c\. It is not the intention to mandate HNB behaviour.

2\) Measurements of surrounding environment (i.e. macro and other HNBs
signal strength)

a\. Issues to address include factors that govern accuracy and
timeliness of the suggested measurements, and the ability to identify
the macro neighbour cell list.

b\. It is not the intention to restrict the vendor's scope about how to
perform measurements.

c\. It is envisaged that measurements will be performed directly by the
HNB or by employing the UEs attached to the HNB, using existing UE
defined measurements.

3\) Mechanism to set maximum power

a\. Issues to address include accuracy and timeliness of HNB maximum
power setting.

b\. It is not the intention to restrict the vendor's scope about how to
process measurements.

c\. It is not the intention to restrict the vendor's scope about which
network element the measurements may be processed in.

d\. It is not the intention to restrict to which network entities
measurements are reported. However, it is not envisaged that new
signalling will be standardised to support this.

4\) Mechanism to adjust HNB uplink.

a\. Issues to address include possibility to adjust uplink noise rise
target.

b\. It is not the intention to restrict the vendor's scope about what
actions may be taken regarding HNB uplink.

5 Radio scenarios
=================

5.1 Deployment configurations
-----------------------------

A number of different deployment configurations have been considered for
Home (e)NodeB. The aspects which define these are as follows:

\- Open access or CSG (Closed Subscriber Group)

\- Open access HNBs can serve any UE in the same way as a normal NodeB

\- CSG HNBs only serve UEs which are a member of a particular Closed
Subscriber Group

\- Dedicated channel or co-channel

\- Whether HNBs operate in their own separate channel, or whether they
share a channel with an existing (e)UTRAN network

\- Fixed or adaptive (DL) maximum transmit power

\- Fixed: HNBs have a set fixed maximum transmit power

\- Adaptive: HNB's sense interference to existing networks, and adjust
maximum transmit power accordingly

The following configurations are considered and are described in more
detail in the following sections.

A. CSG, Dedicated channel, Fixed Power

B. CSG, Dedicated channel, Adaptive Power

C. CSG, Co-channel, Adaptive Power

D. Partial Co-Channel

E. Open Access, dedicated or co-channel

### 5.1.1 Configuration A. CSG, dedicated channel, fixed power

HNB is configured as a Closed Subscriber Group. Access to HNB is
controlled through an arrangement between the HNB owner and by the
network operator. Access is restricted to a very limited number of UE;
the majority of UE do not have access to the HNB. Therefore, a CSG
covers the partially open system, as discussed in \[46\].

The HNB is deployed on a dedicated channel; i.e. a channel that is not
used within the macro layer. The worst case dedicated channel deployment
is the adjacent channel. The worst case adjacent channel deployment is
when the adjacent channel is owned by a different operator.

Although the HNB is deployed on the dedicated frequency with respect to
the macro network, a co-channel interference scenario remains between
HNB's. HNB's must share the same frequency, hence co-channel coexistence
must be analysed within a dense population of HNB.

In this configuration, the Home NodeB's maximum transmit power could
potentially be fixed by the operator to be lower than the Maximum
Transmit power capability. As analysed in detail in \[13\], the reduced
power limit ensures the dominance of the HNB with respect to a macro
cell is appropriately bounded. Therefore, the HNB cell size is limited
with respect to a weak macro signal. Consequently, the HNB can operate
with a fixed maximum power level even at the edge of a macro cell.

### 5.1.2 Configuration B. CSG, dedicated channel, adaptive power

HNB is configured as a Closed Subscriber Group.

The HNB is deployed on a dedicated channel.

Maximum transmit power may be set as high as the maximum capability of
the HNB class of base stations. However, higher maximum power level than
the acceptable "fixed" maximum power for dedicated channel deployment,
Section 5.1.1 shall only be used when appropriate for the deployed
environment, and when the resulting interference is acceptable.

### 5.1.3 Configuration C. CSG co-channel, adaptive power

HNB is configured as a Closed Subscriber Group.

The HNB is deployed on the same channel as the macro network. This is
considered the worst case interference scenario; consequently this is
the highest risk deployment. Power levels used by the Home Node B and
all attached UE's must be set as appropriate for the deployed
environment.

The fixed maximum transmit power limit is not considered feasible for
co-channel deployment and has been removed from further analysis.

### 5.1.4 Configuration D. Partial co-channel

Partial co-channel is proposed for CSG operation for HNBs. This works by
limiting frequencies which are shared by the "macro layer" and the HNB,
as shown in Figure 5.1.4-1. The macro layer uses the all available
frequencies, whereas the home NodeB only uses a subset -- the shared
part. Macro UEs can operate on any frequency. Macro UEs in the shared
part experiencing "pathological" interference from home NodeBs can move
to the clear part.

Whilst this configuration is indented as a solution for CSG operation,
it may also be applicable to Open Access in order to limit the influence
of the HNB in the overall network and allow more control over mobility.

Figure 5.1.4-2 shows how this could be implemented in UTRAN. Two
channels are needed, one for Macro+HNB, the other for Macro only.
Macro-only UEs experiencing HNB interference in channel 1 would handover
to channel 2.

Figure 5.1.4-3 shows how this could be implemented for EUTRAN. Since it
has scalable bandwidth, it does not necessarily require two channels as
with UTRAN. Provided the HENB sub-band does not overlap the central 6
RBs of the macro's channel, then it will not prevent UEs receiving the
BCH and SCH and connecting to the macro layer. Frequency hopping and
Frequency dependent scheduling will ensure UEs experiencing HNB
interference on part of the band will still be able to function.

Providing UEs hand over to the clear channel when experiencing HNB
interference , the performance of this configuration should be similar
to that of configuration A (dedicated channel, fixed power)

### 5.1.5 Configuration E. Open Access, dedicated or co-channel

Open access Home NodeBs serve all UEs, in the same way as other NodeBs
do \[6-8\] . The results referenced in Section 5.2 explain the level of
openness supported by a HNB deployment when explaining the model and
assumptions used. A completely open system is already covered by the
existing classes of Node B.

5.2 Interference scenarios
--------------------------

Home Node B's are intended to enhance the coverage of a UMTS Radio
Access Network in the *[home environment]{.underline}*. However, it is
not feasible to completely control the deployment of the HNB layer
within the UMTS RAN. Therefore, interference due to the HNB is a concern
and interference mitigation techniques are required. Interference
mitigation techniques will impact the HNB performance, which will
present the HNB with challenges in managing its radio resources and
maintaining Quality of Service to its attached users. In the following
sections the interference scenarios that exist between a HNB and the
macro layer, and among HNBs, are discussed in more detail.

Priority of the interference scenario investigations has been
established as shown in Table 5.1.5-1.

In addition to the above scenarios, we also addressed the scenario of a
HNB mobile operating very close to its serving HNB, simulation results
are referred to in Section 5.2.9.

Additionally, possible methods for assessing HNB performance in the
different interference scenarios were proposed in \[9\].

### 5.2.1 Coexistence simulation parameters

Simulation results assuming a wide range of parameters were performed to
ensure a robust and diverse analysis of the problem. The results in this
section were generated over a range of simulation assumptions.
Simulation models are described for different HNB deployment scenarios
in \[10-14\]. Models for the dense urban apartment building, HNB-Macro
are provided in \[12,16\].

### 5.2.2 Interference scenario 1 UL HNB UE  Macro

Noise rise on the macro layer will significantly reduce macro
performance; consequently, the transmit power of the UE should be
controlled. The following mechanisms are investigated to limit the
interference cause by an HNB attached UE:

\- HNB receiver performance will have an impact on UE transmit power;
therefore any relaxation of the BS receiver required must be carefully
investigated.

\- UE power limitations such as maximum transmit power limits, and
strict scheduling limits and noise rise limitation for HSUPA

\- Open access; UEs are permitted to move easily between the macro and
HNB layers, thereby ensuring each uplink connection requires the least
amount of UE transmit power and generates the least amount of
interference \[11\].

### 5.2.3 Interference scenario 2 DL HNB  Macro UE

In a CSG, downlink interference from an HNB will result in coverage
holes in the macro network. In co-channel deployment the coverage holes
are considerably more significant than when the HNB is deployed on a
separate carrier. Several mechanisms are considered to reduce the impact
on the macro coverage:

\- fixed HNB transmit power. (this is only applicable to dedicated
channel deployment)

\- control of HNB behaviour with respect to setting its maximum transmit
power

\- moving macro UE to another carrier. (this is only applicable to the
areas deploying overlay carriers)

\- open access systems.

Deployment scenario C reduces the impact on the macro layer by
automatically adjusting the HNB transmit power. The algorithm used to
control the HNB transmission power will be left as an implementation
detail; consequently a variety of models are explored when setting the
HNB transmission power. Some options are as follows:

\- In \[13\], the maximum output power for each HNB is set based on a
fixed limit in the "dead zone" (out-of-coverage area) that would be
caused by any adjacent channel macro UE.

\- In \[10\], the transmit power for each HNB is set based on the
inverted power control scheme used for macro/macro coexistence
simulation (power control set 1, power control set 2)

\- In \[11\], the average transmit power for both the HNB and the macro
are balanced at the HNB cell edge.

Deployment scenario B, where the HNB output power is controlled and the
HNB's are deployed on an adjacent carrier to the macro layer, is shown
to be of limited use \[15\], since the reduced power limit of Deployment
Scenario A is adequate for coverage of the majority of homes. An
increase in power may be desirable when a large coverage area is
desired, or when coverage within the home is difficult. However, when
the density of HNB is very high, inter-HNB interference dominates, and
an increase in HNB power beyond Deployment scenario A does not result in
performance gains.

Open access provides an alternative solution, as illustrated in \[11\]
and \[19\].

When specifying HNB behaviour, it is the goal of this study item to
avoid any RAN1 impact if possible. If possible, RAN4 will determine the
framework to allow a range of implementation to set the maximum transmit
power. For example, a framework may consist of requirements and tests
for a suitable target power level, but will not specify the algorithm.

It is acknowledge that no single mechanism alone provides a definitive
solution. Any solution will likely involve a combination of methods, and
will certainly have to reach a suitable compromise between macro layer
and HNB layer performance.

### 5.2.4 Interference scenario 3 UL Macro UE  HNB

As described in interference scenario 1, the HNB attached UE is
constrained in its transmit power. Consequently, the HNB attached UE is
especially susceptible to interference from the macro UE. The HNB
receiver must reach a compromise between protecting itself against
uncoordinated interference from the macro UEs, while controlling the
interference caused by its own UE's towards the macro layer.

### 5.2.5 Interference scenario 4 DL Macro  HNB UE

A trade off exists between the HNB coverage and the impact on the macro
network coverage (discussed in Section 5.2.3). The HNB downlink transmit
power can be adjusted to maintain coverage if the dynamic range of the
HNB power is large enough \[16\]. Additional performance analysis in a
closed system is provided in \[14\].

No changes to UE. This is expected to hold for LTE as well. The Wide
Area Base Station defines the UE RF performance. The UE will then be
expected to work with all other classes of eNodeB.

### 5.2.6 Interference scenario 5 HNB  HNB (UL)

With respect to other HNB, co-channel interference must be considered.
This is especially important to deployment option A, where a strong
macro presence is not available on the same frequency to act as a
reference level to determine UE power limits.

It is difficult to avoid co-channel interference between CSG HNB's,
which limits the interference reductions achieved by deploying a CSG HNB
on an separate carrier from the macro network, as shown in \[15,18,33\].
Interference management techniques are required to manage HNB to HNB
interference.

#### 6.1.1.1 Receiver dynamic range

The impact of co-channel uplink interference on the Home NodeB has been
investigated in \[51\] for a scenario where the receiver can be exposed
to strong blocking signals from un-coordinated UEs. It was shown that
the HNB dynamic range requirement needs to be extended by 20dB to
protect the HNB from the strong blocking signal of an un-coordinated UE.

#### 6.1.1.2 Adjacent channel selectivity (ACS)

The impact of adjacent channel uplink interference on the Home NodeB has
been investigated in \[52\] for a scenario where the receiver can be
exposed to strong blocking signals from un-coordinated UEs. It was shown
that the HNB ACS requirement needs to be extended by 10dB to protect the
HNB from the strong blocking signal of an un-coordinated UE.

### 6.1.2 Changes on transmitter characteristics

The main changes on transmitter characteristics were agreed and approved
in \[36\] and \[37\].

#### 6.1.2.1 Base station maximum output power

Maximum output power, Pmax, of the base station is the mean power level
per carrier measured at the antenna connector in specified reference
condition. The rated output power, PRAT, of the BS shall be as specified
in Table 6.0A in the TS 25.104. In summary:

\- the output power of the HNB is limited to 20 dBm (17 dBm for MIMO)

\- a power level of 8 dBm is always accepted

\- an upper limit on the output power of HNB is introduced to protect an
adjacent-channel operator \[37\]

A minimum requirements was also introduced: In normal conditions, the
Base station maximum output power shall remain within +2 dB of the
manufacturer\'s rated output power. In extreme conditions, the Base
station maximum output power shall remain within +2.5 dB of the
manufacturer\'s rated output power. In certain regions, the minimum
requirement for normal conditions may apply also for some conditions
outside the range of conditions defined as normal.

#### 6.1.2.2 Frequency error

During the Home NodeB study item a consensus was reached that the Home
NodeB is expected to support UE speeds up to 30 kmph, see the RAN4
conclusions in TR 25.820. Since the UEs are anyhow required to operate
with speeds up to 250 kmph within a macro cell, the approach here is to
keep the same total frequency error tolerance but allow a larger BS
frequency error as a result of the smaller Doppler.

Considering the maximum UE speed of 30 kmph (8.3 m/s), and following the
same approach as in TR 25.951 and R4-070687, the corresponding frequency
reference error can be calculated as

Assuming *v~UE,max~* = 69.4 m/s (250 kmph), *∆~freq,ppm~* becomes equal
to 0.254 ppm. It is therefore proposed to relax the frequency error
requirement for Home BS class to 0.25 ppm.

The corrsponding text proposal \[38\] was approved in \[36\] during RAN
4 \#48.

#### 6.1.2.3 Spectrum emission mask

The BS spectrum emission mask specifies the maximum allowed BS emission
level in the frequency range from ∆f = 2.5 MHz to ∆f~max~ from the
carrier frequency. In between 2.5 MHz and 12.5 MHz frequency offsets the
BS emissions are also limited by the ACLR requirements. However, for
scenarios where the frequency offset to the UMTS Tx band edge is larger
than 12.5 MHz, the emissions beyond 12.5 MHz offset, e.g. "ACLR3", are
limited only by the spectrum emission mask.

![](media/image6.wmf){width="4.7243055555555555in"
height="3.5416666666666665in"}

Figure 6.1. Base station spectrum emission limits within the UMTS tx
band.

Considering now the current requirements for the Home BS, it is quite
straightforward to notice that the ACLR results in considerably
stringent emission requirements compared to the spectrum emission mask
currently applicable for HNB (P \< 31 dBm), see Figure 6.1. Hence, as a
result the required ACLR3 becomes considerably smaller than the required
ACLR2 as highlighted also in Tdoc R4-080942.

As a solution to avoid this kind of "jumping" ACLR, it is proposed to
introduce an additional requirement, valid only for the Home BS and for
frequency offset 12.5 MHz \< ∆f \< ∆f~max~. Based on the results in Tdoc
R4-080942, and assuming that the maximum output power of the Home BS is
less than 20 dBm, it is proposed that the emissions within 12.5 MHz \<
∆f \< ∆f~max~ shall not exceed:

P - 56 dBm/MHz, for 6 dBm ≤ P \< 20 dBm

and

-50 dBm/MHz for P \< 6 dBm.

The corresponding text proposal \[39\] was included and approved in
\[36\]

#### 6.1.2.4 Adjacent channel leakage power ratio (ACLR)

Based on the findings in Tdoc R4-080939 and R4-080941 the current
(relative) ACLR requirements of 45 dBc (5 MHz offset) and 50 dBc (10 MHz
offset) are sufficient also for Home BS. However, as proposed by the
results in Tdoc R4-081378 and R4-081379, an absolute emission
requirement can be introduced for Home BS in addition to the existing
relative requirement. System simulation results for this were presented
in \[49\]. The value for the absolute requirement is proposed to be
equal to -50 dBm/MHz for both 5 MHz and 10 MHz frequency offsets. The
minimum requirement is calculated from the relative requirement or the
absolute requirement, whichever is less stringent.

The corresponding text proposal \[40\] was included and approved in
\[36\].

6.2 Changes in 3GPP TS 25.141
-----------------------------

This section describes the considered changes to base station
conformance testing.

**The changes in TS 25.141 are summarised in the following tables..
Requirements which are not shown are applicable to Home BS without any
modifications from the existing specifications.**

The necessary modifications to TS 25.141 were approved in \[41-43\]. The
modifications for test models were approved in \[44\], based on the
comparison of different proposals described in \[45\].

7 Guidance on how to control HNB interference
=============================================

7.1 HNB measurements
--------------------

Several types of measurements that HNB can perform are listed in the
following subsections. The objectives of the HNB measurements are

\- to provide sufficient information to the HNB for the purpose of
interference mitigation

\- to provide sufficient information to the HNB such that the HNB
coverage can be maintained.

According to the measurement type, some of these measurements can be
collected through Connected Mode UEs attached to the HNB or via a DL
Receiver function within the HNB itself. Such DL receiver function is
also called Network Listen Mode (NLM), Radio Environment Measurement
(REM) or "HNB Sniffer".

These measurements can also be used during the HNB self-configuration
process.

### 7.1.1 Measurements from all cells

This section identifies the potential measurements performed by HNB
during self-configuration and normal operation. Based on the
measurements in Table 7.1.1-1, the HNB can obtain useful information
from its surrounding cells for purposes such as interference management.

Table 7.1.1-1: HNB measurements from surrounding cells

+----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+
| Measurement Type     | Purpose              | Measurement          |
|                      |                      | Source(s)            |

|                      | interference towards | HUE                  |
|                      | HUEs from            |                      |
|                      | neighbouring cells   |                      |
+----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+
| Adjacent channel     | Calculation of       | HNB DL Receiver      |
| carrier RSSI         | adjacent channel DL  |                      |
|                      | interference towards | HUE                  |
|                      | HUEs from            |                      |
|                      | neighbouring cells   |                      |
+----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+
| CPICH Ec/No          | Calculation of DL    | HNB DL Receiver      |
|                      | interference towards |                      |
|                      | HNB                  | HUE                  |
+----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+
| RTWP                 | Calculation of UL    | HNB Physical Layer   |
|                      | interference towards |                      |
|                      | HNB                  |                      |
+----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+

The CPICH Ec/No measurement could be used in the scenario where the HNB
is installed near a macro NodeB such that the HNB coverage is sufficient
to meet the user requirements.

> The HNB downlink interference level depends on the HNB location and
> coverage area. It can be indicated whether the interference at the
> coverage edge is larger than the interference at the location of HNB
> by a pre-defined value. Therefore, HNB's coverage performance can be
> improved by changing the location of HNB if needed. The downlink
> interference at the coverage edge can be obtained by UE measurement
> reports.
>
> The interference level can be indicated to the HNB's owner. With this
> indication, the owner can make a decision as to where the proper place
> is to install HNB.

HNB could use the RTWP measurement to monitor the uplink interference.
For example, a RTWP measurement value larger than a pre-defined
threshold (where an interfering MUE is close to HNB) would mean that the
MUE's Tx power would cause significant interference towards the HNB.

### 7.1.2 Measurements to identify macro cells

This section identifies the potential measurements performed by HNB
during self-configuration and normal operation. Based on the
measurements in Table 7.1.2-1, the HNB can obtain useful information to
identify its surrounding macrocells and indirectly identifies other HNBs
nearby for purposes such as mobility handling.

7.2 Control of HNB downlink interference
----------------------------------------

### 7.2.1 Control of HNB power

The following subsections provide some guidance on the control of HNB
power relative to its surrounding macro cells and/or other HNBs, as part
of interference mitigation techniques used by the HNB. The control
mechanisms can be either used during HNB normal operation or during
self-configuration process.

#### 7.2.1.1 Control of HNB power with respect to macro layer

This section provides guidelines on setting the HNB total DL transmit
power (data and control channel power) based on the following deployment
scenarios:

\- HNB and MNB operate in either co-channel or adjacent channel

\- HNB situated far away from the MNB (i.e. cell edge scenario)

\- HNB situated close to the MNB (i.e. cell site scenario)

Based on these deployment scenarios, it is therefore expected that there
will be trade-off between the HUE performance and MUE performance when
the HNB transmit power is varied.

First the co-channel deployment of HNB and MNB is analyzed for both cell
site and cell edge cases. The analysis setup assumes a MNB and a HNB. A
MUE is connected to the MNB and a HUE is connected to the HNB as shown
in Figure 7.2.1.1-1.

##### 7.2.1.1.1 Co-channel deployment

In this section, the performance of HNB when deployed co-channel with
MNB is analysed, for both cell site and cell edge cases. For the
analysis, some simplified assumptions have been made in an effort to
show the basic bottlenecks that arise from such deployment scenarios.

The system model is also simplified (compared to a real situation) as
shown in Figure 7.2.1.1-1, which consists of one MNB and one HNB. Only
one MUE is connected to the MNB and only one HUE is connected to the
HNB. We assume the pathloss from the MUE, HUE, HNB to the MNB are all
equal to PL\_MNB, i.e., X=PL\_MNB. The parameters for the setup are
given in Table 7.2.1.1.1-1. The total received signal level (i.e., RSSI)
in the table includes the signals received from all NBs (MNBs and HNBs)
other than the HNB under consideration. The RSSI is assumed to be the
same at the HNB, HUE and MUE. Both the MUE and the HUE are placed at
PL\_HNB from the HNB, i.e., Y=Z=PL\_HNB.

versus cell site

  ------------------------------ ----------- -----------

In the analysis, the HNB Tx power is varied and the corresponding CPICH
Ec/No of both the MUE and the HUE are calculated for different values of
PL\_HNB.

For the Cell Edge case the trade-off results are shown in Figure
7.2.1.1.1-2.

Figure 7.2.1.1.1-2: Trade-off between HUE and MUE performance as a
function of HNB tx power at cell edge

It is observed that the at the cell edge*, the HNB needs to transmit at
low power to maintain the required coverage for the MUE*. Also, as the
desired coverage radius reduces, the HNB power has to be lower to
maintain the MUE performance.

For the Cell Site case the tradeoff results are shown in Figure
7.2.1.1.1-3. *At the cell site the HNB has to increase its power to
maintain good coverage for the HUE while not creating "much"
interference for the MUE*. More power is required to maintain the same
coverage for the HUE compared to the cell-edge case, due to larger
interference from the MNB.

Figure 7.2.1.1.1-3: Trade-off between HUE and MUE performance as a
function of HNB tx power at cell site

In these figures, different PL\_HNB values correspond to different HNB
deployment scenarios. Depending on the particular deployment scenario
(e.g., suburban, urban, dense-urban), the HNB can have different
coverage radius (i.e., link budget). For example, in a suburban
scenario, the HNB coverage can be 100dB whereas a lower HNB coverage
radius (e.g., 70dB) may be more suitable for dense-urban deployments. It
is seen that in the cell edge scenario, using high HNB Tx power results
in poor CPICH Ec/No for the MUE. On the other hand, when HNB is close to
the macrocell site, a low HNB Tx power results in poor CPICH Ec/No for
the HUE. As the HNB Tx power increases, the MUE CPICH Ec/No degrades.
Therefore, the HNB transmit power needs to be adjusted properly to
maintain an acceptable performance for both the HNB and the MNB.

In order to exemplify how to adjust the HNB DL transmit power, we employ
the following algorithm, where **the transmit power of HNB is determined
based on the results of a few measurements. Each HNB measures the total
signal strength (No) from all the other NodeBs (including MNBs and
HNBs). It also measures the pilot strength from the best co-channel and
adjacent-channel MNBs. Based on these measurements, the HNB can
calculate its transmit power:**

1\. To maintain an CPICH Ec/No of -18dB for a MUE located X1 dB away
from the HNB on the same channel (i.e., protect the co-channel macro
user)

2\. To maintain an CPICH Ec/No of -18dB for a MUE located X2 dB away
from the HNB on the adjacent channel (i.e., protect the adjacent channel
macro user)

3\. To make sure that HNB is not causing unnecessary interference to
others by enforcing a cap on CPICH Ec/No of the HUE of -15 dB at X3 dB
away from the HNB.

Using the algorithm above with X1=X3=PL\_HNB, the calibrated HNB
transmit powers for the co-channel case for different PL\_HNB values are
shown in the following table.

Table 7.2.1.1.1-2: Calibrated HNB transmit power for cell-edge and
cell-site scenarios

  -------------------------------------- ------ ----- ------ ------ -----
  PL\_HNB (dB)                           60     70    80     90     100

  Cell Site: HNB Transmit Power in dBm   -3.2   6.8   16.8   20     20
  -------------------------------------- ------ ----- ------ ------ -----

The performance of the HUE and the MUE at the specified coverage radius
and specified HNB output power is given in Table 7.2.1.1.1-3 and
7.2.1.1.1-4 for cell edge and cell site cases, respectively.

  ---------------------- ------ ------ ------ ------- -----

In general, we observe that at the cell edge deployment, the HNB should
transmit at lower power compared to the cell site deployment. This is to
maintain the minimum level of performance requirements for the MUE at
the coverage radius. In some cases, the HNB will end up hitting the
minimum transmit power level (e.g., -10dBm) in an attempt to satisfy the
requirement for the MUE. For the cell-site, in some cases the HNB will
end up hitting the maximum transmit power level (e.g., +20dBm) in an
attempt to provide coverage for the HUE at the HNB coverage radius.

##### 7.2.1.1.2 Adjacent channel deployment

For the adjacent channel scenario, we consider the case when the two
operators have macrocell Node Bs that are *not collocated*. The
simulation parameters for the adjacent operator deployment are shown in
Table 7.2.1.1.2-1.

Table 7.2.1.1.2-1: Parameters for adjacent channel non-collocated
operator deployment.

  ------------ ------------ -------------------
  Parameters   Operator 1   Adjacent Operator
  PL to MNB    100 dB       120 dB
  RSSI         -60 dBm      -80 dBm
  MNB RSCP     -67 dBm      -87 dBm
  ------------ ------------ -------------------

The other simulation parameters are the same as for the co-channel
deployment. A NodeB ACLR of 45dB and UE ACS of 33 dB are assumed, which
result in an ACIR of 33 dB. The MUE and the HUE will have the same
pathloss to the HNB (after taking the ACIR into account), as this is the
worst case envisioned in this study.

The trade-off between the performance of the MUE and the HUE as a result
of varying the HNB transmit power is shown in Figure 7.2.1.1.2-1.

performance as a function of HNB tx power for non-collocated operators

The calculated HNB transmit powers as obtained from the example
algorithm described above with X1=X3=PL\_HNB and X2=47dB are in the
following table.

  --------------------------- ----- ------ ------ ------

The CPICH Ec/No performance of the HUE and the MUE at the specified
coverage radius and specified HNB output power is given in Table
7.2.1.1.2-3.

the HNB tx powers in Table 8.6

  MUE CPICH Ec/No (dB)   -14.7   -18   -18     -18
  HUE CPICH Ec/No (dB)   -15     -20   -29.6   -39.5
  ---------------------- ------- ----- ------- -------

It is observed that the although the HNB is close to the
adjacent-channel cell site, the calibrated powers for the HNB are lower
than those in Table 7.2.1.1.1-2 for the co-channel cell site case. This
is because the HNB has to lower its power to maintain the coverage for
the adjacent operator's MUE. The case is of interest when the MNBs of
the two operators are not collocated.

#### 7.2.1.2 Centralized HNB power control

From the previous studies we noticed that when HNB tries to self
calibrate the transmission power it sometime faces an important
bottleneck: the power necessary for guaranteed coverage in higher that a
level which would also insure the co- and adjacent channels protection.
In the scenarios we assumed, there are cases when either one of them has
to be compromised in the favour of the other. One of the problems is
that HNB measurements on the surrounding environment are not precise
enough (i.e. we refer at the tolerance of the measurements, how often
the HNB can perform these measurement, etc.), to allow the presented
algorithm to calculate the ideal transmission power for the respective
moment in time.

In this section, we explore an alternative approach, when the HNB power
control algorithm is implemented in a *"centralized"* manner. The HNBs
may be initially configured with default thresholds for one or more
parameters: HNB data rate, macro cell dead-zone, CIR of HUEs, detection
of a nearby macro UE etc. The individual HNB then locally calibrates the
transmission power to meet these thresholds by monitoring the relevant
parameters using the algorithm above. As traffic conditions vary, the
HNB gateway, which is an element owned by the operator deploying HNBs,,
may compute the desired thresholds for these parameters and communicate
to the HNBs at a slower or faster time-scale. This network command is
not time-critical and does not rely on all HNBs being able to "hear" the
network. It is meant to simply optimize system performance.

Three options for enhancing the power adjustment of HNBs are proposed
below. Note that these techniques are not mutually exclusive, and may
co-exist with each other.

**- Usage of macro network specific information.** The desired
thresholds for the relevant system parameters (data rate, macro cell
dead-zone coverage etc) are computed by the network for all HNBs. To do
this, the network may take into account macro NodeB load, number of
active HNBs, distance of the HNB to the macro cell, fading environment,
time-of-day etc. The network command with threshold is communicated to
the HNB either through the Broadcast Control Channel (BCCH) or the
backhaul such as DSL or cable connection. By sharing information between
HNB and macro NodeBs using the backhaul, it is possible for HNB to get
more information than otherwise could obtain by listening the broadcast
channels. For example, the close-by macro UE's target signal to noise
ratio (SNR), measured SNR, and received power are information that can
be utilized for HNB power adjustment in a more proper way with respect
to the interference caused to the surrounding macro networks However, it
is required to modify the signalling at the macro layer to support this
functionality and carefully design the backhaul information exchange by
controlling the overhead.

**- Pseudo-static power assignment for HNB.** In addition to dynamic
power calibration, it may be desirable to have a pseudo-static power
assignment to the HNB. The transmit power of the HNB is a simple
function of the HNB's geographical location. The default value for
transmit power and a geographical zone can be pre-configured at the time
of buying a HNB or when there is a change in the location of the HNB.
Any changes to the zone-wise power setting of HNB can be communicated at
a slower time-scale over BCCH or the backhaul such as DSL or cable
connection. However, it is again required to modify the signalling at
the macro layer to support this functionality.

**- Control channel -- data channel power ratio.** The proposal is to
manipulate the ratio between HNB control channels power and HNB data
channels power. For example, depending on the expected throughput, we
can fix the control channel power, while reducing the maximum data
channel power. This will ensure that the coverage area (for the assumed
expected throughput) for HUE does not diminish, but the allowed total
transmit power of HNBs reduces. This will result in improved macro cell
coverage and reduced HNB maximum power requirement, at the same time.
Note that the HNBs can support relatively high data rates even at low
data channel power settings.

#### 7.2.1.3 Control of HNB power with respect to other HNB

**Similar principles as in Section 7.2.1.1 and Section 7.2.1.2 can be
applied to set the Tx power of the HNB in a dedicated deployment. One
difference is that the co-channel macro condition does not apply in this
case. For example, the transmit power of HNB may be determined as
follows.**

**Each HNB measures the total signal strength (No) from all the other
NodeBs (including MNBs and HNBs). It also measures the pilot strength
from the best MNB on the adjacent channel. Based on these measurements,
the HNB determines its transmit power:**

i\. To maintain an CPICH Ec/No of -18dB for a MUE located X2 dB away
from the HNB on the adjacent channel (i.e., protect the adjacent channel
macro user)

ii\. To make sure that HNB is not causing unnecessary interference to
others by enforcing a cap on CPICH Ec/No of the HUE of -15 dB at X3 dB
away from the HNB.

#### 7.2.1.4 Control of HNB power or macro UE based on network control

When the HNBs are deployed on the same channel as the macro network,
macro UEs can experience interference from HNB DL when the macro UE is
nearby a HNB or gets close to the HNB. One potential solution for
mitigating this interference is to control HNB DL or macro UE adaptively
through enhanced interference coordination.

Potential methods for controlling HNB transmission power adaptively
according to the macro UE behavior are as follows;

i\. To reduce the interference to macro UE from HNB, it is useful to
reduce the HNB CPICH power temporarily (this is only applicable when no
HUEs exist on the HNB)

ii\. To avoid the interference to macro UE from HNB, it is useful to
halt the HNB CPICH power temporarily (this is only applicable when no
HUEs exist on the HNB)

A potential method for controlling macro UE adaptively according to the
macro UE behavior is as follows;

i\. To avoid the interference to macro UE from HNB, the macro UE is
driven out to another carrier by the network. (this is only applicable
to the areas deploying overlay carriers)

These solutions may need trigger from macro UEs. AS and NAS procedures
may be utilized for this purpose.

#### 7.2.1.5 Enhancements for Control of HNB Tx Power

##### 7.2.1.5.1 UE-Assisted Power Calibration

To deal with scenarios where there is a significant mismatch between the
RF conditions measured by the HNB and those experienced by the MUEs and
HUEs, it is useful to use UE measurements (or measurement statistics) to
optimize the calibrated HNB Tx power. This is particularly useful in
co-channel deployments and can provide better protection for MUEs while
maintaining good HNB coverage for the HUEs.

For example, if the HNB is placed near a window, HNB may see a stronger
signal from MNB than the indoor HUE. In this case, HNB power calibration
algorithm responding to the higher level of signal from the MNB, may set
the transmit power of the HNB to a higher value than needed for the
coverage of the home. This higher power may create a coverage hole for
the MUEs that may be walking on the street close to the HNB premise.
Therefore, if both the measurements from MUEs and HUEs (e.g. path loss
to HNB), are made available to the HNB, then HNB can fine-tune its HNB
Tx power.

##### 7.2.1.5.2 Minimum HNB Tx power

According to \[57\], the RRC signalling limits the lowest value for
Primary CPICH Tx Power to -10 dBm. For CPICH Ec/Ior of -10 dB, this
limits the lowest power transmit by a HNB to 0 dBm. However, in certain
cases such as when the HNB is located at macro cell edge, the
effectiveness of HNB power calibration algorithms is reduced because of
0 dBm limit imposed by the CPICH signalling. Since the HNB Tx power
calibration algorithm may indicate a value less than 0 dBm as the
desired value, it is useful to reduce the lower limit that can be
signalled for CPICH Tx Power. This should be done in a manner that
ensures backward compatibility with legacy UEs.

7.3 Control of HNB uplink interference
--------------------------------------

The guidance in this section addresses issues related to UL
interference. The specific cases considered are:

a\) how to minimise UL interference from HUEs towards the macro layer
and other neighbour HNBs

b\) how to accommodate UL interference from uncontrolled (e.g. macro)
UEs towards the HNB

### 7.3.1 Control of HUE allowable transmit power

This is to address UL interference from HUEs towards the macro layer and
other neighbour HNBs. This is especially significant when a HUE is at
the edge of its coverage, for example outside the property, but has good
visibility of a neighbouring cell. Under such extreme conditions the UL
power transmitted by the HUE could cause a considerable noise rise at
the macro NodeB impacting its UL capacity.

Such conditions are extreme and potentially unlikely in practice; HUE
transmit levels will not typically cause a significant noise rise at
neighbour cells. However to cover these extreme cases a maximum limit
for the allowed transmit power of HUEs can be defined.

In order to evaluate the potential level of UL interference that can be
caused by a HUE, it is necessary to estimate the pathloss from the
vicinity of the HNB to the neighbouring NodeBs. The pathloss from the
vicinity of the HNB to the neighbouring NodeBs can be derived from
measurements of CPICH RSCP of the neighbouring cells -- potentially made
by UEs attached to the HNB or by the HNB itself using a Downlink Receive
mode of operation. Details of these measurements can be found in Section
7.1.

Based on the pathloss and other related parameters, the HNB can then
determine a maximum allowed HUE transmit power, such that the noise rise
experienced at the neighbour cells is constrained to be within an
acceptable limit. This maximum power level would be signalled to the HUE
as part of its normal RRC connection setup procedure. Further, periodic
and/or event-triggered pathloss measurements made by the UEs can be used
by the HNB to update the maximum allowable UE transmit power or a
correction factor that used to offset the initial maximum allowable UE
transmit power determined during the HNB self-configuration. The updated
value can be signalled to the UE using e.g., Radio Bearer
Reconfiguration message.

Alternatively, a fixed "cap" on the HUE transmit power could be defined
irrespective of the proximity of the macro NodeB. Such approach offers
simpler HNB implementation. However, due to no adaptation in the HUE
transmit power level, if the cap is set too high, then this will create
high UL interference. On the other hand, if the cap is set too low, then
the UL interference is reduced at the expense of a potential reduction
in the HUE UL throughput. Therefore, this limit would need to be
selected such that the noise rise generated at the macro layer was
acceptable in the worst case co-channel deployment scenario. A suggested
value for this limit is 21dBm.

The pros and cons of these mitigation techniques can be summarised in
Table 7.3.1-1.

+----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+

The noise rise at the MNB due to the HUE UL transmission can be
determined from the estimated pathloss, as shown in the following link
budget example. Table 7.3.1-2 shows the parameters used on the link
budget analysis.

Note that "estimated pathloss" is the difference between the MNB "CPICH
Tx Power" as indicated in its System Information and the CPICH RSCP as
received at the HNB. Therefore "estimated pathloss" is equivalent to
actual pathloss minus the MNB and HNB antenna gains.

From these characterisations, the HNB can select a maximum allowable HUE
transmit power based on the estimated pathloss, the desired limit to the
noise rise at the MNB and the RSCP and/or RSSI levels of other neighbour
NodeBs.

### 7.3.2 Control of HNB noise rise threshold

This is a mitigation technique to address UL interference from
uncontrolled macro or other HNB UEs towards the HNB. This is especially
significant for CSG deployments, as illustrated by the following
scenarios:

1\. Uncontrolled UEs may be located within the premises where the HNB is
installed while still being attached to an external macro network. In
such cases the macro UE's transmit power will be high while the pathloss
to the HNB will be small.

2\. A HUE can generate a large UL noise rise at the HNB if the pathloss
is very small and the HUE cannot be powered down due to limited dynamic
range.

This mitigation approach also applies to the use of HSUPA and is
associated with the UL scheduler. Specifically the scheduler in the HNB
is configured to dynamically allow a greater UL noise rise (rise over
thermal) than would normally be the case for a macro NodeB. This ensures
that the HNB scheduler will be able to continue to grant significant
capacity on the UL, so that HUE traffic throughput can be maintained, in
the presence of an interfering macro UE or when a HUE cannot be powered
down.

Adjustment of the UL noise rise threshold can be made by the HNB, driven
by measurements of receive total wideband power (i.e. RTWP) or other
similar measurement entities on the UL (as outlined in Section 7.1).
Blocking levels of UL noise rise due to out of cell interference can be
detected and the noise rise threshold adjusted accordingly. This
adjustment would only need to be made temporarily while the UL
interference was strong and as the noise rise was seen to fall the noise
rise threshold could be returned to its normal operating value.
However, in the presence of such greater UL noise rise, the HNB receiver
should be designed so as to ensure proper system stability for HUEs
(e.g., in the presence of bursty interference from MUE or power race
among multiple HUEs) and adequate demodulation performance.

Modifying the HNB scheduler in this way will increase HUE throughput but
as a result will also increase the UL interference caused by the HUEs at
the macro layer. As a consequence the UL throughput of macro UEs can
become degraded. The application of an upper limit on the HUE transmit
power, as discussed in Section 7.4.1, will ensure that this effect is
constrained to an acceptable level.

Table 7.3.2-1 summarises the control of HNB noise rise threshold.

deployment scenarios

### 7.3.3 Control of HNB receiver gain

This is an alternative mitigation technique to address UL interference
from uncontrolled UEs towards the HNB and increase in noise rise from a
HUE that cannot be powered down due to limited dynamic range. Again it
is especially significant for CSG deployments where uncontrolled UEs may
be located within the HNB premises while still being attached to an
external macro network. In such cases,

\- the macro UE's transmit power could be high while the pathloss to the
HNB could be small, or

\- the uncontrolled UE (i.e. a HUE) associated with a neighbour HNB
could be transmitting at high power, or

\- own HUE located very close to the HNB could be transmitting at high
power as it cannot be powered down due to limited dynamic range

This mitigation approach is based *on dynamic control of the receiver
gain* or UL attenuation, also known as *adaptive noise figure
adjustment*. This has the effect of moving the dynamic range of the HNB
receiver such that the interfering UE is no longer blocking the UL. As a
consequence the HNB receiver is temporarily desensitised during periods
of reduced gain or attenuation.

Adjustment of the receiver gain or UL attenuation can be made by the
HNB, driven by measurements of receive total wideband power (i.e. RTWP)
or other similar measurement entities on the UL. Blocking levels of UL
noise rise due to out of cell interference can be detected and the
receiver gain reduced accordingly. This adjustment would only need to be
made temporarily while the UL interference was strong and as soon as the
noise rise was seen to fall the receiver gain could be returned to its
normal operating value.

This adjustment would also need to react fast when the UL interference
is strong or noise rise from a HUE is high and slowly decay with time,
e.g., to accommodate variations in interference due to bursty traffic.
The effect of such desensitisation would be to temporarily cause HUEs to
increase their own UL transmit power and thereby increase interference
to the macro layer. Therefore, it is crucial to determine the correct
amount of attenuation that will improve the HUE's performance without
degrading the MUEs. The application of an upper limit on the HUE
transmit power, as discussed in Section 7.4.1, will ensure that a
runaway positive feedback condition is avoided.

#### 7.3.3.1 Performance analysis

The performance of using dynamic control of the receiver gain or UL
attenuation can be obtained using the following analysis setup. The
general set up for the uplink analysis is given in Figure 7.3.3.1-1. The
cell edge case is considered first, where a HNB is deployed at the edge
of a macro cell and it has an active HUE associated with it. There is
also a MUE which is located close to the HNB. The HNB, HUE and the MUE
are assumed to have 140dB PL with the MNB (X=140dB). The HUE and the MUE
are assumed to be separated from the HNB by Y and Z dB PL, respectively.

![](media/image7.wmf){width="1.8340277777777778in"
height="2.7576388888888888in"}

Figure 7.3.3.1-1: UL Interference Analysis Setup

The PL values of interest (i.e., Y and Z) depend on the HNB coverage
determined by the tx power chosen. T**hree deployment scenarios are
considered: a) HNB with 70dB coverage radius, b) HNB with 80dB coverage
radius, and c) HNB with 90dB coverage radius. Both cell edge and cell
site scenarios are analyzed.** The performance analysis for the cell
edge and cell site scenarios demonstrate the need for an adaptive
algorithm that adjusts the UL attenuation / padding based on the
out-of-cell interference experienced at the HNB.

##### 7.3.3.1.1 Cell edge scenarios

For cell edge scenario, the following PL pairs are investigated in more
detail (Table 7.3.3.1-1). When the HNB coverage of 70dB is targeted, the
HNB tx power cannot go as low as required (min HNB total tx power
limitation of -10dBm is assumed). Therefore, a MUE located at the edge
of the targeted coverage region will be in outage. Hence, the MUE is
placed 80dB away from the HNB in this case.

Table 7.3.3.1-1: Cell edge parameters

  -------------------------------- ---------- ------- -------
  Parameters                       Values             
  HUE UL Ec/No at HNB              -2.4 dB            
  HNB default Noise Figure         19 dB              
  Maximum HUE/MUE Tx Power         21 dBm             
  MNB Noise Figure                 5 dB               
  Additional interference at MNB   -101 dBm           
  Y: PL (HUE to HNB)               70 dB      80 dB   90 dB
  Z: PL (MUE to HNB)               80 dB      80 dB   90 dB
  -------------------------------- ---------- ------- -------

Being at the cell edge, the MUE is assumed to be transmitting at 21dBm
(e.g., the maximum UE total tx power). The MUE transmitting at high
power close to the HNB can significantly increases the noise rise at the
HNB. This noise rise contribution is denoted by Ec/No', where Ec is
received signal strength of the MUE at the HNB and No' corresponds to
the received signal strength in the absence of HUE or MUE. The goal of
the UL interference management is to keep the MUE contribution on the
HNB noise rise below the noise rise threshold by adding attenuation or
increasing the noise figure, such that the HUEs can get scheduled.

In Figure 7.3.3.1-2, the solid curves correspond to the noise rise
contribution of the MUEs at the HNB as a function of the additional
padding / UL attenuation applied at the HNB. The HUE transmit power is
determined based on a -2.4dB Ec/No requirement. The dashed curves
correspond to the noise rise contribution of HUE at the MNB. Although
the transmit power of the HUE is increased with the additional
attenuation applied at the HNB, the HUE is still located very close to
the HNB while being on the edge of the MNB coverage. Therefore, the
HUE's contribution to the MNB noise rise is minimal.

Figure 7.3.3.1-2: UL cell edge scenario: noise rise contribution of
non-associated UEs

The HUE and MUE Ec/No values at their corresponding serving NBs are
provided in Figure 7.3.3.1-3. Although the effect of HUE on the macro
network is minimal, using more than the required amount of attenuation
is not desired. For the cases where HUE to HNB PL is 80dB and 90dB, it
is observed that beyond 10dB and 20dB additional noise figure
respectively, the HUE starts running out of headroom and is unable to
maintain the Ec/No requirement.

A reference algorithm trying to maintain the out-of-cell contribution to
the HNB noise rise at 3dB would choose the following UL attenuation
values (Table 7.3.3.1-2):

+---------------------------+-------+-------+-------+

##### 7.3.3.1.2 Cell site scenarios

For cell site scenarios, the HNB is deployed close to the macro cell
site. In this case the HNB, HUE and the MUE are assumed to have 100dB PL
to the MNB (X=100dB). The PL values of interest (i.e., Y and Z) again
depend on the HNB coverage determined by the tx power chosen. For the
cell site case, the following PL pairs are investigated in more detail
(Table 7.3.3.1-3). When a HNB coverage of 90 or 100dB is targeted, the
HNB tx power becomes insufficient due to the max HNB total tx power
limitation of 20dBm. Therefore, a HUE located at the edge of targeted
coverage region is unable to maintain -20dB CPICH Ec/No with the HNB.

Table 7.3.3.1-3: Cell site parameters

  -------------------------------- ---------- ------- -------
  Parameters                       Values             
  HUE UL Ec/No at HNB              -2.4 dB

  HUE maximum Tx Power             21 dBm             
  MUE Tx Power                     -15 dBm            
  HNB maximum Tx Power             20 dBm             
  MNB Noise Figure                 5 dB               
  Additional interference at MNB   -101 dBm           
  Y: PL (HUE to HNB)               70 dB      80 dB   80 dB
  Z: PL (MUE to HNB)               70 dB      80 dB   90 dB
  -------------------------------- ---------- ------- -------

Being at the cell site, the MUE is assumed to be transmitting at -15dBm.
In Figure 7.3.3.1-4, the noise rise contributions of the MUE and HUE at
the HNB and MNB, respectively are presented. Here again, the HUE
transmit power is determined based on a -2.4 dB Ec/No requirement.

As seen in Figure 7.3.3.1-4, unlike the cell edge case, there is no need
for large additional UL attenuation values to control the noise rise at
the HNB. In fact, if unnecessary attenuation is applied, then the HUE tx
power increases considerably, creating significant noise rise at the
MNB.

In Figure 7.3.3.1-5, the UE Ec/No values at their serving NB are
presented. It is clearly seen that the MNB Ec/No goes down if more than
necessary UL attenuation is used. For certain cases, the HUE could also
run out of headroom and not be able to maintain the required Ec/No.

7.4 HNB self-configuration
--------------------------

HNB should perform self-configuration at power up and on a regular basis
during normal operation. Depending on the implementation, the HNB should
be able to relay its measurements to, and receive its RF configuration
from, an external configuration element such as network planning server,
O&M server and HNB-GW. Such configuration elements can also optimize the
RF parameters of a set of HNBs in a joint manner. However, this section
does not describe the operation of these configuration elements and is
limited to the self-configuration of a HNB based on the self-obtained
information..

> The HNB self-configuration can also be activated on a regular basis
> provided that no UE is RRC connected to the HNB or all UEs attached to
> the HNB are in idle mode. The self-configuration capability of HNB
> should not impact the existing UE behaviour. If any UE served by the
> HNB has on-going voice/data transmission, the HNB should wait until
> the corresponding UE to complete its voice/data transmission, release
> the RRC connection and then activate the self-configuration mode.

The self-configuration activation period can be set to long, medium or
short (exact value FFS). For example, activation period can be set to 24
hours in order to activate HNB self-configuration mode once a day.
Performing self-configuration on a regular basis (self-configuration
interval FFS) or event triggered self-configuration will help to reduce
excessive interference generated by the HNB to the surrounding
macrocells and HNBs.

Self-configuration of HNB consists of setting a number of RF parameters
to a value which is optimized for achieving the proposed objectives. The
most important parameters are:

\- Choosing the right carrier frequency,

\- Selecting the optimum DL scrambling code

\- Selecting suitable LAC and/or RAC.

\- Setting the optimum maximum allowable Tx power level in downlink and
uplink,

\- Building a set of cell lists, and,

\- Processing the UE measurement reports (if available)

The HNB self-configuration requirements are listed in Table 7.4-1.
Detailed fulfilment of HNB self-configuration requirements is vendor
specific (i.e. dependent on self-configuration modes). Generally, the
HNB self-configuration can be broadly divided into passive and active
mode. The passive mode HNB self-configuration satisfies only the basic
requirements, while the active mode HNB self-configuration is capable of
handling more complex tasks such as detecting of abnormal operating
conditions, decoding UE measurement reports, neighbour cell list
construction, etc.

### 7.4.1 Scrambling code selection

In general, HNB should have abilities to detect interference and
scrambling code. Using the information detected, HNB selects a spare
scrambling code which is not used by neighboring HNBs. For example, HNB
can monitor the radio signal in its downlink bands before setting up its
own cell. Then, the HNB selects a scrambling code as its operating
scrambling code which is not used by the neighboring HNBs or macro
cells.

Therefore, each HNB would require to be configured for a particular
scrambling code on the downlink. If neighbouring HNBs use the same
scrambling code, significant problems can arise since HUEs may not be
able to associate with the correct HNB. In macrocell networks,
scrambling codes for base stations are carefully managed so that base
stations in a certain region use different scrambling codes. This,
however, is not very practical for HNBs and a more autonomous method to
select the scrambling codes would be useful for HNBs. The goal of such a
mechanism is to minimize the number of scrambling code collisions for a
given number of total scrambling codes.

For instance, depending on the HNB deployment strategy, a certain set of
scrambling codes can be reserved for HNBs, denoted as S~HNB~={*S~1~,
S~2~, ..., S~Nsc\ ~*}. If the HNBs operate on a dedicated carrier, the
HNB can scan all the available scrambling codes (i.e., *N~sc~*=512) and
the total number of scrambling codes that can be reserved for HNBs is
configurable. If HNBs operate on a shared carrier (co-channel) with
macrocell, a certain subset of available scrambling codes should be
reserved for HNBs and these codes should not be used by any macrocell
base station.

During HNB self-configuration, HNB scans for all scrambling codes and
construct a set of scrambling codes which have pilot energy above
detection threshold: S~DETECTED~={*S~i~, S~j~, ..., S~k~*}. Note that
some of the scrambling codes in the set S~DETECTED~ can be part of the
set S~HNB~ (i.e., PSCs used by neighbouring HNBs) and rest of the set
can be part of "macrocell only" scrambling codes. Then, HNB can select
the "best" scrambling code based on certain criteria, for example:

\- If all HNB-reserved scrambling codes are being used by neighbour HNBs

\- HNB picks a scrambling code in S~HNB~ with smallest amount of
detected energy (i.e., smallest CPICH Ec/No and CPICH RSCP)

\- Else

\- HNB picks a scrambling code randomly from set of scrambling codes
that are member of S~HNB~ but not member of S~DETECTED~

Upon failure to pick the "best" scrambling code, an alarm or some form
of error indication shall be send to the network controller (e.g. Core
Network, HNB-GW, O&M server). The details of alarm triggering threshold
is FFS.

### 7.4.2 Carrier or UARFCN selection

In general, HNB should have abilities to select a carrier frequency
using information such as interference level. For example, HNB can
monitor the radio signal in its downlink bands before setting up its own
cell. Once the HNB gets the inference level (RSSI) on each of its
available frequencies, it selects a carrier frequency as its operating
frequency which has the smallest interference.

Therefore, each HNB needs to be configured for a certain carrier
frequency (channel or UARFCN) to operate on. Such a mechanism depends on
the particular deployment configuration listed in section 5.1. If there
is only one available carrier for all HNBs, there could be certain
amount of inter-HNB interference. One solution for addressing this issue
would be to use multiple carriers for HNBs. For example, HNBs in
neighboring apartments can be assigned to different frequency carriers
to mitigate the potential interference problems.

If macrocells operate on the same carrier as HNBs, then HNB-macrocell
interference can result in a certain amount of outage and performance
degradation both for HUEs and MUEs. One solution for mitigating the
HNB-macro interference would be to make sure the carriers used by HNBs
are not used by macrocells. Although this method reduces HNB-macro
interference noticeably, it is not efficient in terms of spectrum
utilization especially if HNB deployment density is not high. Also, the
total number of available carriers for an operator needs to be
considered in this decision. For most operators with limited carriers
(e.g., two or three carriers), sharing the carriers between HNBs and
macrocells could be preferable. In this case, if a MUE goes into
coverage hole of a HNB, it could perform inter-frequency handoff to
another carrier frequency[^1]. In order to minimize the number of
inter-frequency hand-off events for MUEs, HNBs may prefer a certain
frequency and use other frequencies only in the homes where there is
noticeable interference from neighboring HNBs.

In general if an operator has *N* carrier frequencies:
F={*f~1~,f~2~,...,f~N~*}, then HNBs are allowed to use a certain subset
(F~HNB~) of these frequencies while macrocells can use a certain subset
(F~macro~). Without loss of generality, in the following, we will assume
F~HNB~={*f~1~,f~2~,...,f~K~*} and F~macro~={*f~M~,f~M+1~,...,f~N~*}
where 1 ≤ *K* ≤ *N* and 1 ≤ *M* ≤ *N*.

As a possible method for carrier selection, during self configuration,
the HNB will measure the RSS values for all *K* carrier frequencies and
find the carriers with least interference, denoted as *No~min~*. The
accuracy of RSS measurement is \[FFS\]. In order to find the carrier
suitable for operation, the HNB can scan all the available UARFCN or
carrier frequencies and, starting from *f~1~*, choose *f~i~* if
*No~f\_i~ ≤ No~min~ + HNB\_Frequency\_RSS\_margin*. The usage of the
parameter *HNB\_Frequency\_RSS\_margin* is to adjust the tradeoff
between selecting least interference carrier and concentrating the HNBs
on certain carriers such that coverage hole created by macrocell is
minimized.

### 7.4.3 Neighbour cell list configuration and handover

During the HNB self-configuration mode, HNB should be able to use the
macrocells information detected on a set of UARFCNs to build the
following cell lists:

\- Intra-frequency cell list

\- Inter-frequency cell list

\- Inter-RAT list

In addition to the standard cell lists above, the HNB may also construct
the following cell lists:

\- Preferred cell camping list. This list can be a subset of the normal
cell camping list and can be operator configurable (via O&M server). The
purpose of the preferred cell camping list is to prioritise certain
cells for HUE to camp on for load balancing, traffic and QoS control.

\- Preferred RAT handover list. This is can be a subset of the normal
IRAT list and can be operator configurable (via O&M server). The purpose
of the preferred RAT handover list is to prioritise the handover
preference of certain RAT cells (e.g. prefer handover to EDGE over
GSM/GPRS).

Upon constructed the cell lists, the HNB can broadcast some of the cell
list information (in e.g. SIB11) to the UEs served by the HNB.

When an HUE leaves the coverage area of HNB it can be handed over to
macro network. In order to support the handover from HNB to macro
network, HNBs should detect macro neighboring cells and add them to
their neighbour cell list automatically.

In addition, when a number of HNBs may be required to be deployed as a
small network, the HNB neighbour cell list can be configured
automatically by the HNB or a HNB controller (e.g. HNB-GW) in order to
facilitate the handover between HNBs.

To enable MNBs and network aware of the cell list information, the cell
lists constructed by the HNB during self-configuration mode and/or
subsequent cell list updates can be fed back to the network controller
(i.e. Core Network, HNB-GW) via either HNBAP or TR-069 \[55\]
signalling.

### 7.4.4 HNB DL power setting

HNBs with large transmit power may cause significant interference to
macro network and neighboring HNBs, leading for example to dropped calls
for the connected UEs on same and adjacent channels. Therefore the
transmit power of HNBs should be controlled. Coverage range and
interference level in different HNB deployment environments are
different and varied. For this reason the HNBs should have the ability
to adjust its power autonomously and/or based on the report from UEs
about interference and signal quality detected by the UEs.

HNB DL power setting is a function of HNB cell coverage, macrocell
interference and other-HNB interference. Given a suitable DL operating
power range, the HNB should be able to set its output Tx power by taking
into account a number of criterions such as:

\- The CPICH Ec/No at the expected edge of coverage of the HNB is of
sufficient quality to provide adequate coverage/performance for the HNB

\- The macro layer CPICH Ec/No at the expected edge of coverage of the
HNB is not severely degraded

\- The adjacent-channel macro layer CPICH Ec/No at certain
distance/pathloss from the HNB is not severely degraded

Out of all these three objectives, the last one is of special importance
when the adjacent channel belongs to another operator, as it refers to
the impact of HNB activity on the surrounding networks on adjacent
channels.

### 7.4.5 HUE UL power setting

During HNB self-configuration, the HNB should set a maximum allowed
transmit power for its UEs based on the pathloss to the neighbour NodeBs
and the expected received power at neighbour NodeBs such that if its UEs
were transmitting at this maximum power level they will not cause a
significant UL noise rise to the neighbour NodeBs, and thus compromise
the coverage or capacity significantly. The pathloss to the neighbour
NodeBs can be estimated via measurements outlined in subclause 7.1. The
received power at the neighbour NodeBs can be obtained either from
measurements outlined in subclause 7.1 or from network (e.g. Core
Network, HNB-GW).

Note that the process to set HUE maximum allowed transmit power should
not alter the existing UE behaviour. Also, the HUE transmit power will
mainly affect the macro NodeBs operating on the same frequency channels
as the Home NodeB.

As the HUE transmit power does not significantly affect the surrounding
macro NodeBs operating on adjacent channels (i.e. other operator's
network), the HUE power adjustment remains an operator choice.

### 7.4.6 LAC/RAC selection

In a CSG deployment, in order to perform user authentication for the
UEs, one technique is to utilize Location Area Update/Routing Area
Update procedure. This technique assumes that each HNB is configured
with a LAC that is different from the surrounding macro cells and nearby
HNBs, so that a UE always performs location area update when it tries to
camp on the HNB. Therefore, during the HNB self-configuration mode, the
HNB should be capable of selecting a suitable LAC (or RAC) from a list
of available LACs/RACs.

However, the drawback of user authentication via LAU/RAU procedure is
that there may be potentially a large number of LAU/RAU update reject
messages generated when a HUE is not allowed to camp on to a consecutive
number of HNBs under certain mobility scenarios, particularly for CSG
type deployment.

The solution to avoid generating a large number of LAU/RAU update reject
messages is \[FFS\].

### 7.4.7 Extreme/Abnormal operating conditions

There are certain conditions whereby the HNB might not be able to
provide optimal RF performance to its HUEs, such as not having an
accurate picture of the surrounding RF environment or the RF
self-configuration algorithms not being able to select parameters within
supplied bounds. In the event of detecting an error condition the HNB
may use a set of RF parameters defined by the operator which will
provide restricted HNB coverage or could disable radio transmission
\[56\] until the situation has been rectified.

Table 7.4.7-1 provides a list of such conditions, their implications on
HNB operation and suggested actions to take on detecting such
conditions.

Note 1: For regulatory reasons (e.g., intended by Japan and Germany),
HNB should be able to stop radio transmission \[56\].

7.5 Control of HNB coverage
---------------------------

In principle, the HNB transmit power could be used to ensure HNB
coverage. This is because the HNB coverage range and interference level
in different HNB deployment environment are different and variable. With
HNB adjusting its Tx power either autonomously and/or based on
interference and signal quality detected and reported by surrounding
UEs, the HNB coverage can be controlled.

The HNB coverage is determined by HNB output power, the data rate
provided to the HUEs, and the external interference that HNB system
received from macrocells and surrounding HNBs. There is no simple
formula to define the HNB coverage as a function of all the parameters
involved. However, the HNB coverage can be used as a trade-off in order
to reduce the interference caused to the macrocells or other surrounding
HNBs. Some interference control mechanisms in Section 7.2 and Section
7.3 can also be used to control the HNB coverage.

The HNB can be uplink and downlink coverage limited depending on the
link budgets. The coverage of the HNB can also be controlled via dynamic
switching of service-level date rates.

8 Interference tests
====================

//Editors note: this section is to test the ability of HNB maximum
allowable transmit power dependant of co-channel interference
conditions.

The following subsections describe example test procedure and parameters
which can be used to evaluate HNB self-configuration and performance in
both uplink and downlink scenarios.

8.1 Downlink
------------

### 8.1.1 Co-channel tests

**In order to ensure reasonable behaviour of HNB on the DL, two
scenarios are considered for HNB deployments: a) cell edge and b) cell
site. The DL scenario under consideration is shown in Figure 8.1-1. Cell
edge refers to the case where the HNB and UEs are at the macro cell edge
and cell site refers to the case where the HNB and UEs are close to the
macro cell edge.**

![](media/image7.wmf){width="1.8868055555555556in"
height="2.8409722222222222in"}

Figure 8.1-1: DL interference scenario

Since a HNB can have different coverage radius (i.e., link budget)
depending on the particular deployment scenario (e.g., suburban, urban,
dense-urban)**, three categories of HNBs are considered: a) HNB with
70dB coverage radius, b) HNB with 80dB coverage radius, and c) HNB with
90dB coverage radius.** A HNB with a particular coverage radius shall
adjust its transmit power within the minimum and maximum power limits
such that the MUE at the coverage radius can maintain a minimum quality
of the CPICH Ec/No and the HUE can maintain an acceptable quality of
CPICH Ec/No at the coverage radius. HNB DL tests are given below for the
three HNB categories. The purpose of these tests is to ensure the HNB Tx
power is adjusted properly to provide good HNB coverage and limit the
coverage hole on macro.

**[Test Set-up:]{.underline}**

**The test set-up is as follows.** The HNB under test is on frequency
F1. A noise generator on F1 generates Ioc as specified in Table 8.1.1-1.
A NB on frequency F1 is set up such that the RSSI (including Ioc) and
the RSCP at the HNB are as specified in Table 8.1-1.

Table 8.1.1-1: Parameters for HNB DL co-channel tests

  ----------------- ----------- -----------
  Test Parameters   Cell Edge   Cell Site
  PL to MNB         140 dB      100 dB
  RSSI at HNB       -95 dBm     -60 dBm
  MNB RSCP          -107 dBm    -67 dBm
  Ioc at HNB        -96dBm      -75dBm
  ----------------- ----------- -----------

In the following tests, the requirements are in terms of lower and upper
limits for HNB Tx power. The lower limits are specified such that a HUE
at the HNB coverage radius is able to maintain -18dB CPICH Ec/No. For
the upper limits, a margin of a few dBs (\~3dB) is included to allow for
variations in the algorithm used for HNB Tx powers. CPICH Ec/Ior of
-10dB for HNB and MNB are assumed. The tests assume +20dBm as the
maximum power for the HNB.

#### **8.1.1.1 DL test for HNB with 70dB coverage radius**

**For the test scenario described in Table 8.1.1-1, the total output
power of the HNB with a designed coverage radius of 70dB shall be as
specified in Table 8.1.1-2.**

specified in Table 8.1.1-4.**

  --------------------- ----------------- ------------- ------------ ---------------------------------------

### 8.1.2 Adjacent channel tests

The purpose of the test is to ensure that a HNB does not cause
unacceptable interference to the adjacent channel operator. The HNB can
use measurements such as RSSI and RSCP to adjust its transmit power such
that it does not cause interference for the adjacent channel operator.
The test set-up and requirements are specified in \[25.104/25.141\].

8.2 Uplink
----------

### 8.2.1 Basic tests

Uplink interference between HNBs and the macro layer comprises three
components, identified in the figure below as (a) (b) and (c):

Figure 8.2-1: UL interference paths

The interference mitigation approaches presented in Section 7.4 above
have addressed all of these interference components, but the key
requirement being tested here is that the UL interference from the HUE
towards the macro layer (component (a) in the figure above) is
controlled to be within an acceptable limit.

The additional Dynamic Range and ACS tests for the Home BS class in
25.104, as specified in \[3\], have ensured that the HNB receiver can
accommodate increased levels of interference (b) and (c) from nearby
uncontrolled UEs. Guidance on how to make this accommodation has been
provided in Sections 7.4.2 and 7.4.3 above. It has further been noted
that as a result of this mitigation the transmit power of the HUE will
increase, potentially causing additional noise rise at the macro layer
-- so interference paths (b), (c) and (a) are inextricably linked. The
way in which this positive feedback cycle is broken is through the
application of a limit on the HUE allowable transmit power as discussed
in Section 7.4.1 above.

Therefore, given that mitigation techniques to accommodate UL
interference (b) and (c) towards the HNB have already been tested by the
new Dynamic Range and ACS requirements in 25.104, it is sufficient from
a "closed loop" system perspective to ensure that the maximum UL
interference (a) towards the macro layer is controlled. This can be
tested as follows.

#### 8.2.1.1 Test setup

Figure 8.2-2: UL interference test setup

The MNB emulator is configured to transmit a P-CPICH and a P-CCPCH. The
latter physical channel carries the BCH on which SIB5 is transmitted,
providing an indication of the P-CPICH Tx Power. Note that the actual
transmit power of the P-CPICH does not need to align with this signalled
value. Sufficient other SIBs must also be present to allow for
identification of the NodeB as part of the macro layer, rather than
another HNB. The cabled connection to the HNB receiver passes through a
variable attenuator (not shown in the figure above) such that the pilot
power (RSCP) arriving at the HNB can be controlled.

The HNB makes measurements, as defined in Section 7.1 above, of the
macro P-CPICH RSCP and the decoded P-CPICH Tx Power IE in order to
estimate the pathloss to the MNB. From this estimate it can derive a
value for the maximum HUE allowable transmit power such that the noise
rise at the macro layer is constrained. This value will be signalled to
the HUE as part of a subsequent RL Setup procedure for AMR 12.2 kbps
service and can be logged at the HUE for verification.

#### 8.2.1.2 Test parameters

Based on the analysis in subclause 7.4.1 above, the following test
parameters are specified for the co-channel and adjacent channel cases.
The maximum allowable HUE transmit power is defined such that it causes
no more than \[1dB\] noise rise at the MNB:

Notes:

1\. The Pathloss of 100dB and 140dB represent typical "cell-site" and
"cell-edge" scenarios respectively.

2\. The maximum allowable HUE Tx power is capped at a maximum level of
\[21 dBm\] as per Section 7.4.1 above.

### 8.2.2 HSUPA tests

#### 8.2.2.1 HNB-Macro tests 

**For the uplink tests, we again consider three deployment scenarios: a)
HNB with 70dB coverage radius, b) HNB with 80dB coverage radius, and c)
HNB with 90dB coverage radius. Separate cell edge and cell site tests
are specified. The uplink tests are to be carried out in a cabled-up lab
setup. The HNB and MNB in these tests are on the same carrier frequency
(i.e., co-channel). All the path loss values specified here include
antenna gains.**

**For the cell edge tests, the test setup is as displayed in Figure
8.2.2.1-1(i). The HUE, HNB and MUE path loss to the MNB is assumed to be
140dB. The MNB is assumed to experience interference at -101dBm from
users other than the HUE, which is modelled through an AWGN noise source
(not shown in the picture). Two BS testers are used as the HUE and the
MUE, which are connected to the HNB and the MNB through channel
emulators. AWGN channel is assumed and path loss values of the links are
set as specified in the test description. The MUE is set to transmit at
21dBm max Tx power, with power control disabled. The HNB is run with the
regular UL scheduler and power control enabled with full queue traffic.
The UL throughput and the transmit power at the BS tester (HUE) is
measured. The MNB does not play any role in the test requirements.**

**For the cell site tests, a HNB, a MNB and a single BS tester (HUE) are
used (Figure 8.2.2.1-1(ii) ). The HUE and HNB path loss to the MNB is
assumed to be 100dB. A channel emulator is used to adjust the path loss
between the HUE and the HNB. The HNB is operated with the regular UL
scheduler with full queue traffic. The UL throughput and the transmit
power at the BS tester (HUE) is measured. It should be noted that since
there is no MUE present in this test, the only purpose of having a MNB
is for path loss estimation in case it is used by the HNB.**

The E-DPDCH demodulation tests for FRC1 and FRC2 for Ped A channel with
no Rx diversity have been used as reference to show that the transmit
power and throughput requirements for the cell-edge and cell-site tests
are indeed achievable. However, since the power control is enabled for
these tests, AWGN channel is used instead of PedA to minimize the
fluctuations in HUE tx power and throughput (due to fading).

**The test requirements for the different HNB coverage scenarios are
given below.**

##### 8.2.2.1.1 Uplink test for HNB with 70dB coverage radius 

**The purpose of the test is for the HUE to achieve a minimum UL
throughput while its average total transmit power does not exceed the
requirement given in Table 8.2.2.1.1-1.**

**For the cell edge test, the HUE transmit power can go as high as the
maximum limit of 21 dBm. The test requirement is in terms of an upper
limit for the HUE average transmit power while the HUE average
throughput is above a certain value. The throughput and transmit power
requirements are chosen based on an Ec/No target of 0.8 dB
(corresponding to the FRC2 E-DPDCH demodulation test).**

For the cell site test, the maximum Tx power is specified such that the
HUE interference at the MNB which is 100dB away is limited to 5dB below
the noise floor of the MNB which is -103dBm. Here again, **an Ec/No
target of 0.8 dB is used.**

  ---------------- ----------- -----------
  Parameter        Cell Edge   Cell Site
  PL to MNB        140dB       100dB

  HUE Throughput   ≥ 811kbps   ≥ 811kbps
  HUE Tx Power     ≤ 21dBm     ≤ -8dBm
  ---------------- ----------- -----------

##### 8.2.2.1.2 Uplink test for HNB with 80dB coverage radius 

**The purpose of the test is for the HUE to achieve a minimum uplink
throughput at the HNB for cell site case while its average total
transmit power does not exceed the requirement given in Table
8.2.2.1.1-2.**

**For the cell edge test, the HUE transmit power can go as high as the
maximum limit of 21 dBm. The test requirement is specified in terms of
an upper limit for the HUE average transmit power while the HUE average
throughput is above a certain value. The throughput and transmit power
requirements are chosen based on an Ec/No target of -2.4 dB
(corresponding to the FRC1 E-DPDCH demodulation test).**

For the cell site test, the maximum tx power is specified such that the
HUE interference at the MNB which is 100dB away is limited to 5dB below
the noise floor of the MNB which is -103dBm. Here, **an Ec/No target of
0.8 dB is used (corresponding to the FRC2 E-DPDCH demodulation test).**

  HUE Throughput   ≥ 405kbps   ≥ 811kbps
  HUE Tx Power     ≤ 21dBm     ≤ -8dBm
  ---------------- ----------- -----------

##### 8.2.2.1.3 Uplink test for HNB with 90dB coverage radius 

**The purpose of the test is for the HUE to achieve a minimum uplink
throughput at the HNB for the cell edge case while its average total
transmit power does not exceed the requirement given in Table
8.2.2.1.1-3. A cell site test is not specified for this particular HNB
coverage case due to the fact that the max Tx power limit of 20dBm on
the HNB does not allow the coverage to be 90dB.**

**For the cell edge test, the HUE transmit power can go as high as the
maximum limit of 21 dBm. The test requirement is specified in terms of
an upper limit for the HUE average transmit power while the HUE average
throughput is above a certain value. The throughput and transmit power
requirements are chosen based on an Ec/No target of -2.4 dB
(corresponding to the FRC1 E-DPDCH demodulation test).**

Table 8.2.2.1.1-3: UL test specifications - 90dB HNB coverage

  ---------------- ------------
  Parameter        Cell Edge
  PL to MNB        140dB
  PL MUE to HNB    90dB
  HUE Throughput   ≥ 405 kbps
  HUE Tx Power     ≤ 21dBm
  ---------------- ------------

#### 8.2.2.2 Inter-HNB uplink test 

The inter-HNB test corresponds to two neighbouring HNBs on the same
carrier as shown in Figure 8.2.2.2-1.

**The purpose of the test is for the HUEs to maintain a minimum uplink
throughput at their own HNBs while their total transmit powers do not
exceed the requirements given in Table 8.2.2.2-1.**

**The test requirement is specified in terms of an upper limit for the
HUE average transmit power while the HUE average throughput is above a
certain value. The throughput and transmit power requirements are chosen
based on an Ec/No target of 0.8 dB (corresponding to the FRC2 E-DPDCH
demodulation test).**
