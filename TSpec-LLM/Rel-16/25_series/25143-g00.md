3 Definitions, symbols and abbreviations
========================================

3.1 Definitions
---------------

For the purposes of the present document, the following terms and
definitions apply:

**Donor coupling loss:** is the coupling loss between the repeater and
the donor base station.

**Down-link:** signal path where base station transmits and mobile
receives

**Maximum output power, Pmax:** This is the mean power level per carrier
measured at the antenna connector of the Repeater in specified reference
condition.

**Operating band:** the frequency range in which UTRA FDD operates, that
is defined with a specific set of technical requirements.

NOTE 1: The operating band(s) for an UTRA Repeater is declared by the
manufacturer according to the designations in clause 4.1, Table 4.1.

NOTE 2: Unless specified, operating band refers to the uplink operating
band and downlink operating band.

**Pass band:** the pass band is the frequency range in which the
Repeater operates in with operational configuration. This frequency
range can correspond to one or several consecutive nominal 5 MHz
channels. If they are not consecutive each subset of channels shall be
considered as an individual pass band. A repeater can have one or
several pass bands.

**Repeater:** a device that receives, amplifies and transmits the
radiated or conducted RF carrier both in the down-link direction (from
the base station to the mobile area) and in the up-link direction (from
the mobile to the base station). In operating bands specified with only
down-link or up-link, only the up-link or down-link as specified for the
operating band is repeated.

**Up-link:** signal path where mobile transmits and base station
receives.

b\) A UTRA/FDD Repeater can support both fixed and variable up-link to
down-link frequency separation.

c\) The use of other up-link to down-link frequency separations in
existing or other frequency bands shall not be precluded.

4.3 Channel arrangement
-----------------------

### 4.3.1 Channel spacing

The nominal channel spacing is 5 MHz, but this can be adjusted to
optimise performance in a particular deployment scenario.

### 4.3.2 Channel raster

The channel raster is 200 kHz for all bands, which means that the centre
frequency must be an integer multiple of 200 kHz. In addition a number
of additional centre frequencies are specified according to the table
4.4, which means that the centre frequencies for these channels are
shifted 100 kHz relative to the general raster.

### 4.3.3 Channel number

The carrier frequency is designated by the UTRA Absolute Radio Frequency
Channel Number (UARFCN).

For each operating band, the UARFCN values are defined as follows.

Uplink: N~U~ = 5 \* (F~UL~ -- F~UL\_Offset~), for the carrier frequency
range F~UL\_low~ ≤ F~UL~ ≤  F~UL\_high~

Downlink: N~D~ = 5 \* (F~DL~ -- F~DL\_Offset~), for the carrier
frequency range F~DL\_low~ ≤ F~DL~ ≤  F~DL\_high~

For each operating Band, F~UL\_Offset~, F~UL\_low~, F~UL\_high~,
F~DL\_Offset~,, F~DL\_low~ and F~DL\_high~ are defined in Table 4.3 for
the general UARFCN. For the additional UARFCN, F~UL\_Offset~,
F~DL\_Offset~ and the specific F~UL~ and F~DL~ are defined in Table 4.4.

5 General test conditions and declarations
==========================================

This specification applies only to UTRA/FDD Repeater.

The requirements of this clause apply to all applicable tests in this
specification. Many of the tests in this specification measure a
parameter relative to a value, that is not fully specified in the
UTRA specifications. For these tests, the Minimum Requirement is
determined relative to a nominal value specified by the manufacturer.

Some requirements for the Repeater may be regional as listed in
subclause 5.6.

When specified in a test, the manufacturer shall declare the nominal
value of a parameter, or whether an option is supported.

Schematic drawings for the individual measurement set-up can be found in
the Annex.

5.1 Acceptable uncertainty of Test System
-----------------------------------------

The maximum acceptable uncertainty of the Test System is specified below
for each test, where appropriate. The Test System shall enable the
stimulus signals in the test case to be adjusted to within the specified
tolerance, and the equipment under test to be measured with an
uncertainty not exceeding the specified values. All tolerances and
uncertainties are absolute values, and are valid for a confidence level
of 95 %, unless otherwise stated.

A confidence level of 95% is the measurement uncertainty tolerance
interval for a specific measurement that contains 95% of the performance
of a population of test equipment.

For RF test it should be noted that the uncertainties in subclause 5.1
apply to the Test System operating into a nominal 50 ohm load and do not
include system effects due to mismatch between the DUT and the Test
System.

### 5.1.1 Measurements of test environments

The measurement accuracy of the Repeater test environments defined in
Subclause 5.4, Test environments shall be.

> Pressure: ± 5 kPa.
>
> Temperature: ± 2 degrees.
>
> Relative Humidity: ± 5 %.
>
> DC Voltage: ± 1,0 %.
>
> AC Voltage: ± 1,5 %.
>
> Vibration: 10 %.
>
> Vibration frequency: 0,1 Hz.

The above values shall apply unless the test environment is otherwise
controlled and the specification for the control of the test environment
specifies the uncertainty for the parameter.

5.2 Repeater test tolerances (informative)
------------------------------------------

The Test Tolerances defined in this subclause have been used to relax
the Minimum Requirements in this specification to derive the Test
Requirements.

The Test Tolerances are derived from Test System uncertainties,
regulatory requirements and criticality to system performance. As a
result, the Test Tolerances may sometimes be set to zero.

The test tolerances should not be modified for any reason e.g. to take
account of commonly known test system errors (such as mismatch, cable
loss, etc.)

5.3 Interpretation of measurement results
-----------------------------------------

The measurement results returned by the Test System are compared --
without any modification -- against the Test Requirements as defined by
the share risk principle.

The share risk principle is defined in ETR 273 Part 1 sub-part 2 section
6.5.

The actual measurement uncertainty of the Test System for the
measurement of each parameter shall be included in the test report.

The recorded value for the Test System uncertainty shall be, for each
measurement, equal to or lower than the appropriate figure in subclause
5.1 of this specification.

If the Test System for a test is known to have a measurement uncertainty
greater than that specified in subclause 5.1, it is still permitted to
use this apparatus provided that an adjustment is made as follows.

Any additional uncertainty in the Test System over and above that
specified in subclause 5.1 shall be used to tighten the Test
Requirement-making the test harder to pass. (For some tests e.g.
receiver test, this may require modification of stimulus signals). This
procedure will ensure that a Test System not compliant with subclause
5.1does not increase the chance of passing a device under test where
that device would otherwise have failed the test if a Test System
compliant with subclause 5.1 had been used.

5.4 Test Environment
--------------------

For each test in the present document, the environmental conditions
under which the Repeater is to be tested are defined.

### 5.4.1 Normal test environment 

When a normal test environment is specified for a test, the test should
be performed within the minimum and maximum limits of the conditions
stated in Table 5.3.

Table 5.3: Limits of conditions for Normal Test Environment

  --------------------- ------------------------------------------ ---------
  Condition             Minimum                                    Maximum
  Barometric pressure   86 kPa                                     106 kPa
  Temperature           15°C                                       30°C
  Relative Humidity     20 %                                       85 %
  Power supply          Nominal, as declared by the manufacturer   
  Vibration             Negligible                                 
  --------------------- ------------------------------------------ ---------

The ranges of barometric pressure, temperature and humidity represent
the maximum variation expected in the uncontrolled environment of a test
laboratory. If it is not possible to maintain these parameters within
the specified limits, the actual values shall be recorded in the test
report.

NOTE: This may, for instance, be the case for measurements of radiated
emissions performed on an open field test site.

### 5.4.2 Extreme test environment

The manufacturer shall declare one of the following:

1\) the equipment class for the equipment under test, as defined in the
IEC 60 721-3-3 \[6\];

2\) the equipment class for the equipment under test, as defined in the
IEC 60 721-3-4 \[7\];

3\) the equipment that does not comply to the mentioned classes, the
relevant classes from IEC 60 721 \[6\], \[7\] documentation for
Temperature, Humidity and Vibration shall be declared.

NOTE: Reduced functionality for conditions that fall out side of the
standard operational conditions are not tested in the present document.
These may be stated and tested separately.

#### 5.4.2.1 Extreme temperature

When an extreme temperature test environment is specified for a test,
the test shall be performed at the standard minimum and maximum
operating temperatures defined by the manufacturer's declaration for the
equipment under test.

**Minimum temperature:**

The test shall be performed with the environment test equipment and
methods including the required environmental phenomena into the
equipment, conforming to the test procedure of IEC 60 068-2-1 \[8\].

**Maximum temperature:**

The test shall be performed with the environmental test equipment and
methods including the required environmental phenomena into the
equipment, conforming to the test procedure of IEC 60 068-2-2 \[9\].

NOTE: It is recommended that the equipment is made fully operational
prior to the equipment being taken to its lower operating temperature.

### 5.4.3 Vibration

When vibration conditions are specified for a test, the test shall be
performed while the equipment is subjected to a vibration sequence as
defined by the manufacturer's declaration for the equipment under test.
This shall use the environmental test equipment and methods of inducing
the required environmental phenomena in to the equipment, conforming to
the test procedure of IEC 60 068-2-6 \[10\]. Other environmental
conditions shall be within the ranges specified in subclause 5.4.1.

NOTE: The higher levels of vibration may induce undue physical stress in
to equipment after a prolonged series of tests. The testing body should
only vibrate the equipment during the RF measurement process.

### 5.4.4 Power supply

When extreme power supply conditions are specified for a test, the test
shall be performed at the standard upper and lower limits of operating
voltage defined by manufacturer's declaration for the equipment under
test.

**Upper voltage limit:**

The equipment shall be supplied with a voltage equal to the upper limit
declared by the manufacturer (as measured at the input terminals to the
equipment). The tests shall be carried out at the steady state minimum
and maximum temperature limits declared by the manufacturer for the
equipment, to the methods described in IEC 60 068-2-1 \[8\] Test Ab/Ad
and IEC 60 068-2-2 \[9\] Test Bb/Bd: Dry Heat.

**Lower voltage limit:**

The equipment shall be supplied with a voltage equal to the lower limit
declared by the manufacturer (as measured at the input terminals to the
equipment). The tests shall be carried out at the steady state minimum
and maximum temperature limits declared by the manufacturer for the
equipment, to the methods described in IEC 60 068-2-1 \[8\] Test Ab/Ad
and IEC 60 068-2-2 \[9\] Test Bb/Bd: Dry Heat.

5.5 Selection of configurations for testing
-------------------------------------------

Most tests in the present document are only performed for a subset of
the possible combinations of test conditions. For instance:

> \- only one RF channel may be specified to be tested;
>
> \- only one timeslot may be specified to be tested.

When a test is performed by a test laboratory, the choice of which
combinations are to be tested shall be specified by the laboratory. The
laboratory may consult with operators, the manufacturer or other bodies.

When a test is performed by a manufacturer, the choice of which
combinations are to be tested may be specified by an operator.

5.6 Regional requirements

5.9 Repeater configurations
---------------------------

### 5.9.1 Power supply options

If the repeater is supplied with a number of different power supply
configurations, it may not be necessary to test RF parameters for each
of the power supply options, provided that it can be demonstrated that
the range of conditions over which the equipment is tested is at least
as great as the range of conditions due to any of the power supply
configurations.

### 5.9.2 Combining of Repeaters

If the repeater is intended for combination with additional apparatus
connected to a repeater port and this combination is supplied as a
system, the combination of repeater together with the additional
apparatus shall also fulfil the repeater requirements. E.g. if the
repeater is intended for combination such that multiple repeaters
amplify the same signals into the same ports the combination shall also
fulfil the repeater requirements.

An example of such a configuration is shown in figure 5.1

Figure 5.1: Example of repeater configuration

6 Output power
==============

Maximum output power, Pmax, of the Repeater is the mean power level per
carrier at maximum Repeater gain that the manufacturer has declared to
be available at the antenna connector.

6.1 Maximum output power
------------------------

### 6.1.1 Definition and applicability

Maximum output power, Pmax, of the Repeater is the mean power level per
carrier measured at the antenna connector in specified reference
condition.

### 6.1.2 Minimum Requirements

In normal conditions as specified in section 5.4.1, the Repeater maximum
output power shall remain within limits specified in Table 6.1 relative
to the manufacturer's rated output power.

  39 ≤ P \< 43 dBm     +2 dB and -2 dB
  31 ≤ P \< 39 dBm     +2 dB and -2 dB
  P \< 31 dBm          +3 dB and -3 dB
  -------------------- -----------------

In extreme conditions as specified in section 5.4.2 and 5.4.4, the
Repeater maximum output power shall remain within limits specified in
Table 6.2 relative to the manufacturer's rated output power.

  P ≥ 43 dBm           +2,5 dB and -2,5 dB
  39 ≤ P \< 43 dBm     +2,5 dB and -2,5 dB
  31 ≤ P \< 39 dBm     +2,5 dB and -2,5 dB
  P \< 31 dBm          +4 dB and -4 dB
  -------------------- ---------------------

In certain regions, the minimum requirement for normal conditions may
apply also for some conditions outside the ranges defined for the Normal
test environment in subclause 5.4.1.

### 6.1.3 Test purpose 

To verify that the Repeater maximum output power is within the limit
specified in 6.1.2.

### 6.1.4 Method of test

#### 6.1.4.1 Initial conditions

1\) Set-up the equipment as shown in annex A.

2\) Connect the signal generator equipment to the Repeater input port.

3\) Connect the power measuring equipment to the Repeater output port.

#### 6.1.4.2 Procedure

1\) Set the signal generator to transmit a signal modulated with a
combination of PCCPCH, SCCPCH and Dedicated Physical Channels specified
as test model 1 in TS 25.141.

2\) Adjust the input power to the Repeater to create the maximum nominal
Repeater output power at maximum gain.

> 3\) Measure the mean power at the RF output port over a certain slot.
>
> 4\) Increase the power with 10 dB compare to the level obtained in
> step 2.
>
> 5\) Measure the mean power at the RF output port over a certain slot.

In addition, on one UARFCN only, the test shall be performed under
extreme power supply as defined in subclause 5.4.4

NOTE: Tests under extreme power supply also test extreme temperature.

### 6.1.5 Test Requirements

In normal conditions as specified in section 5.4.1, the Repeater maximum
output power shall remain within limits specified in Table 6.3 relative
to the manufacturer's rated output power.

In certain regions, the minimum requirement for normal conditions may
apply also for some conditions outside the ranges defined for the Normal
test environment in subclause 5.4.1.

NOTE: If the above Test Requirement differs from the Minimum Requirement
then the Test Tolerance applied for this test is non zero. The Test
Tolerance for this test is defined in subclause 5.2 and the explanation
of how the Minimum Requirement has been relaxed by the Test Tolerance is
given in Annex B.

7 Frequency stability
=====================

Frequency error is the measure of the difference between the frequency
of the received signal and the frequency of the re-transmitted signal.

7.1 Definition and applicability
--------------------------------

The frequency stability is a measure of the frequency deviation of the
output signal with respect to the input signal. The test shall address
the uplink and the downlink path of the Repeater.

7.2 Minimum Requirement
-----------------------

In normal conditions as specified in section 5.4.1 the frequency
deviation shall be within ± 0,01 ppm.

7.3 Test purpose
----------------

To verify that the Frequency Error is within the limit specified in 7.2.

7.4 Method of test
------------------

### 7.4.1 Initial conditions

> 1\) Set-up the equipment as shown in annex A.
>
> 2\) Connect the cw signal generator equipment to the Repeater input
> port.
>
> 3\) Connect the frequency counter to the Repeater output port. Both
> the signal generator and the frequency counter shall use the same
> reference frequency.
>
> 4\) Adjust the input power to the Repeater to create the maximum
> nominal Repeater output power as declared by the manufacturer at
> maximum gain.

### 7.4.2 Procedure

Measure the frequency error for both paths uplink and downlink of the
Repeater.

7.5 Test requirements 
---------------------

The measurement result of 7.4.2 shall not exceed:

\| f ~IN~ -- f out \| ≤ (f out \* 0,01 ppm) + 12 Hz

8 Out of band gain
==================

8.1 Definitions and applicability
---------------------------------

Out of band gain refers to the gain of the Repeater immediately outside
the pass band. The measurements shall apply to both paths uplink and
downlink of the Repeater.

8.2 Minimum Requirements
------------------------

The intended use of a repeater in a system is to amplify the in band
signals and not to amplify the out of band emission of the donor base
station.

In the intended application of the repeater, the out of band gain is
less than the donor coupling loss.

The repeater minimum donor coupling loss shall be declared by the
manufacturer. This is this the minimum required attenuation between the
donor BS and the repeater for proper repeater operation.

In normal conditions as specified in section 5.4.1 the gain outside the
pass band shall not exceed the maximum level specified in Table 8.1,
where:

> \- f\_offset is the distance from the centre frequency of the first or
> last 5 MHz channel within the pass band.

  12,5 MHz ≤ f\_offset                                     35 dB
  -------------------------------------------------------- --------------

For 12,5 MHz ≤ f\_offset the out of band gain shall not exceed the
maximum gain of table 8.2 or the maximum gain stated in table 8.1
whichever is lower.

  Note: The out of band gain is considered with 12,5 MHz ≤ f\_offset   
  -------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------

8.3 Test purpose
----------------

The purpose of this test is to verify that the Repeater meets the out of
band gain requirements as specified in TS 25.106.

8.4 Method of test
------------------

### 8.4.1 Initial conditions

Set-up the equipment as shown in annex A.

The test shall be performed with an offset between CW-signal and the
first or last 5 MHz channel within the pass band of 2,7 MHz, 3 MHz, 3,5
MHz, 5 MHz, 7,5 MHz, 10 MHz, 12,5 MHz, 15 MHz and 20 MHz, excluding
other pass bands. In addition the test shall also be performed for all
harmonic frequencies of the repeaters pass band up to 12,75 GHz, for
operating bands f ≤ 3,0GHz, or up to the 5^th^ harmonic of the upper
frequency edge of the DL or UL operating band, for operating bands f \>
3,0GHz.

### 8.4.2 Procedure

1\) Set the Repeater to maximum gain.

2\) Set the signal generator to generate a CW-signal, applied to the
input port of the Repeater. The power level of the RF input signal shall
be at least 5 dB below the power level which, when applied within the
pass band, would produce the maximum rated output power, as declared by
the manufacturer. This is to ensure that the equipment is operating in
the linear output range.

3\) The average output power in each case shall be measured using a
spectrum analyser connected to the output port of the Repeater and the
net gain shall be recorded compared to table 8.3 or table 8.4 whichever
is lower.

4\) With the same input power as in step 1) set the repeater gain to the
minimum specified by the manufacturer.

5\) The average output power in each case shall be measured using a
spectrum analyser connected to the output port of the Repeater and the
net gain shall be recorded and compared to table 8.3 or table 8.4
whichever is lower.

9 Unwanted emission
===================

Unwanted emissions consist of out-of-band emissions and spurious
emissions \[4\]. Out of band emissions are unwanted emissions
immediately outside the pass band bandwidth resulting from the
modulation process and non-linearity in the transmitter, but excluding
spurious emissions. Spurious emissions are emissions which are caused by
unwanted transmitter effects such as harmonics emission, parasitic
emission, intermodulation products and frequency conversion products,
but exclude out of band emissions.

The out-of-band emissions requirement for repeater is specified both in
terms operating band unwanted emissions and protection of the BS
receiver in the operating band. The Operating band unwanted emissions
define all unwanted emissions in the repeater operating band plus the
frequency ranges 10 MHz above and 10 MHz below that band. Unwanted
emissions outside of this frequency range are limited by a spurious
emissions requirement.

9.1 Out of band emission
------------------------

### 9.1.2 Operating band unwanted emissions

#### 9.1.2.1 Definitions and applicability

Operating band unwanted emissions comprise an emission mask applied
outside the repeater passband and a general requirement applied outside
the mask but inside the frequency range of the operating band unwanted
emissions.

The general operating band unwanted emissions limits are given in table
9.0.

The masks defined in Table 9.1, Table 9.2, Table 9.3, and Table 9.4
below may be mandatory in certain regions. In other regions this mask
may not be applied.

#### 9.1.2.2 Minimum Requirements

For regions where this clause applies, the requirement shall be met by a
repeater's RF-signal output at maximum gain with WCDMA signals in the
pass band of the Repeater, at levels that produce the maximum rated
output power per channel. In normal conditions as specified in section
5.4.1 emissions shall not exceed the maximum level specified in Table
9.1, Table 9.2, Table 9.3, and Table 9.4 for the appropriate Repeater
maximum output power, in the frequency range from ∆f = 2,5 MHz to ∆f
~max~ from the 5 MHz channel, where:

\- ∆f is the separation between the centre frequency of first or last 5
MHz channel used in the pass band and the nominal -3 dB point of the
measuring filter closest to the carrier frequency.

\- f\_offset is the separation between the centre frequency of first or
last 5 MHz channel in the pass band and the centre of the measuring
filter.

\- f\_offset~max~ is 12,5 MHz.

\- ∆f ~max~ is equal to f\_offset~max~ minus half of the bandwidth of
the measurement filter.

To select the table of the maximum level for the spectrum emission mask
test, use the maximum output power as defined in subclause 3.1
Definition. If one channel is used for the spectrum emission mask test
use this power for the selection. If two channels are used for the
spectrum emission mask test use the power of one of these.

In certain regions the following requirement may apply for protection of
DTT. For UTRA Repeater operating in Band XX, the level of emissions in
the band 470-790 MHz, measured in an 8MHz filter bandwidth on centre
frequencies F~filter~ according to Table 9.4D, shall not exceed the
maximum emission level P~EM,N~ declared by the manufacturer.

  ------------------------------------ ----------------------- ---------------------------------

NOTE: The regional requirement is defined in terms of EIRP (effective
isotropic radiated power), which is dependent on both the repeater
emissions at the antenna connector and the deployment (including antenna
gain and feeder loss). The requirement defined above provides the
characteristics of the repeater needed to verify compliance with the
regional requirement. Compliance with the regional requirement can be
determined using the method outlined in TS 25.104 \[1\] Annex D.

In certain regions, the following requirements may apply to UTRA
repeaters operating in Band XXXII within 1452-1492 MHz. The level of
unwanted emissions, measured on centre frequencies f\_offset with filter
bandwidth, according to Table 9.4E shall neither exceed the maximum
emission level P~EM,B32,a\ ,~ P~EM,B32,b~ nor P~EM,B32,c~ declared by
the manufacturer.

NOTE: The regional requirement, included in \[14\], is defined in terms
of EIRP per antenna, which is dependent on both the repeater emissions
at the antenna connector and the deployment (including antenna gain and
feeder loss). The requirement defined above provides the characteristics
of the base station needed to verify compliance with the regional
requirement. The assessment of the EIRP level is described in Annex H of
TS36.104 \[15\].

In certain regions, the following requirement may apply to UTRA
repeaters operating in Band XXXII within 1452-1492 MHz for the
protection of services in spectrum adjacent to the frequency range
1452-1492 MHz. The level of emissions, measured on centre frequencies
F~filter~ with filter bandwidth according to Table 9.4F shall neither
exceed the maximum emission level P~EM,B32,d~ nor P~EM,B32,e~ declared
by the manufacturer. This requirement applies in the frequency range
1429-1518 MHz even though part of the range falls in the spurious
domain.

Note for Tables 9.1, 9.2, 9.3, 9.4, 9.4A, 9.4B and 9.4C:

NOTE 1: This frequency range ensures that the range of values of
f\_offset is continuous.

NOTE 2 As a general rule, the resolution bandwidth of the measuring
equipment should be equal to the measurement bandwidth. However, to
improve measurement accuracy, sensitivity and efficiency, the resolution
bandwidth can be smaller than the measurement bandwidth. When the
resolution bandwidth is smaller than the measurement bandwidth, the
result should be integrated over the measurement bandwidth in order to
obtain the equivalent noise bandwidth of the measurement bandwidth.

#### 9.1.2.3 Test purpose

The purpose of this test is to verify that the Repeater meet the
spectrum emission requirements as specified in TS 25.106.

#### 9.1.2.4 Method of test

##### 9.1.2.4.1 Initial conditions

A measurement set‑up is shown in annex A

1\) Connect a signal generator to the input port of the Repeater for
tests of repeaters with a pass band corresponding to one 5 MHz channel.
If the pass band corresponds to two or more 5 MHz carriers, two signal
generators with a combining circuit or one signal generator with the
ability to generate several WCDMA carriers is connected to the input.
The signals shall be de-correlated as described in TS25.141 \[11\],
clause 6.1.1.6.3 of equal power.

2\) Measurements with an offset from the carrier centre frequency
between 2,515 MHz and 4,0 MHz shall use a 30 kHz measurement bandwidth.

3\) Measurements with an offset from the carrier centre frequency
between 4,0 MHz and (∆fmax -- 500 kHz) shall use a 1 MHz measurement
bandwidth. The 1MHz measurement bandwidth may be calculated by
integrating multiple 50 kHz or narrower filter measurements.

4\) Detection mode: True RMS.

##### 9.1.2.4.2 Procedures

1\) Set the Repeater to maximum gain.

2\) Set the signal generator(s) to generate signal(s) in accordance to
test model 1, TS 25.141 subclause 6.2.1.1.1, at level(s) which produce
the manufacturer specified maximum output power at maximum gain.

3\) Measure the emission at the specified frequencies with specified
measurement bandwidth and note that the measured value does not exceed
the specified value.

4\) Increase the power with 10 dB compare to the level obtained in step
2.

5\) Measure the emission at the specified frequencies with specified
measurement bandwidth and note that the measured value does not exceed
the specified value.

6\) If the pass band corresponds to more than two consecutive nominal 5
MHz channels, repeat step 2) to 5) with any combination of two WCDMA
modulated signals of equal power in the repeaters pass band.

7\) Switch of the signal generator.

8\) Measure the emission at the specified frequencies with specified
measurement bandwidth and note that the measured value does not exceed
the specified value.

#### 9.1.2.5 Test requirements

The measurement result of step 3 and 5 of 9.1.4.2 shall not exceed the
maximum level specified in tables 9.5 to 9.8 for the appropriate
Repeater maximum output power.

given in Annex B.

### 9.1.3 Protection of BS receiver in the operating band

This requirement shall be applied for the protection of UTRA-FDD BS
receivers in geographic areas in which UTRA-FDD Repeater and UTRA-FDD BS
are deployed.

The requirement applies at frequencies that are more than 10 MHz below
or more than 10 MHz above the repeater pass band.

#### 9.1.3.1 Minimum Requirement

This requirement applies to the uplink of the repeater, at maximum gain.

In the up-link direction of the Repeater the power of any spurious
emission shall not exceed:

>
> NOTE 3: The protection of R-GSM is for further study.

### 9.1.4 Co-existence with services in adjacent frequency bands

This requirement may be applied for the protection in bands adjacent to
bands I or VII, as defined in clause 4.1 in geographic areas in which
both an adjacent band service and UTRA are deployed.

The requirement applies only to the down-link direction of the repeater.

#### 9.1.4.1 Minimum requirement

The power of any spurious emission shall not exceed:

9.2 Spurious emissions
----------------------

### 9.2.1 Definition and applicability

Spurious emissions are emissions which are caused by unwanted
transmitter effects such as harmonics emission, parasitic emission,
intermodulation products and frequency conversion products, but exclude
out of band emissions. This is measured at the Repeater output port.

The requirements of either subclause 9.2.2.1 or subclause 9.2.2.2 shall
apply whatever the type of Repeater considered (one or several pass
bands). It applies for all configurations foreseen by the manufacturer's
specification.

The spurious emission limits apply from 9 kHz to 12.75 GHz (or above, as
indicated in Table 9.9 and 9.10), excluding the frequency range from 10
MHz below the lowest frequency of the repeaters operating band up to 10
MHz above the highest frequency of the repeaters operating band.
Exceptions are the requirement in Table 9.17 and 9.21 that apply also
closer than 10 MHz from repeaters operating band.

Unless otherwise stated, all requirements are measured as mean power
(RMS).

For repeaters capable of supporting both UTRA and E-UTRA, conformance to
the UTRA spurious emission requirements can also be demonstrated using
E-UTRA spurious emission test methods as described in TS 36.143 \[13\].

### 9.2.2 Minimum Requirements

In normal conditions as specified in section 5.4.1 the following
requirements shall be met.

#### 9.2.2.1 Spurious emission (Category A)

The following requirements shall be met in cases where Category A limits
for spurious emissions, as defined in ITU-R Recommendation SM.329 \[4\],
are applied.

At maximum Repeater gain, with WCDMA signals in the pass band of the
Repeater, at levels that produce the maximum rated output power per
channel, the power of any spurious emission shall not exceed the limits
specified in Table 9.9.

When the power in all channels is increased by 10 dB the requirements
shall still be met.

The requirement shall apply both with or without an input signal
applied.

#### 9.2.2.2 Spurious emission (Category B)

The following requirements shall be met in cases where Category B limits
for spurious emissions, as defined in ITU-R Recommendation SM.329 \[4\],
are applied.

At maximum Repeater gain, with WCDMA signals in the pass band of the
Repeater, at levels that produce the maximum rated power output per
channel, the power of any spurious emission shall not exceed the limits
specified in Tables 9.10 and 9.10A depending on the declared operating
band for the down- and up-link.

When the power in all channels is increased by 10 dB the requirements
shall still be met.

The requirement shall apply both with or without an input signal
applied.

These requirements may be applied for the protection of UE, MS and/or BS
operating in other frequency bands in the same geographical area. The
requirements may apply in geographic areas in which both UTRA FDD
Repeater and a system operating in another frequency band than the FDD
operating band are deployed. The system operating in the other frequency
band may be GSM900, DCS1800, PCS1900, GSM850, E-UTRA FDD and/or UTRA
FDD.

> NOTE 1: The requirements of -53dBm/100kHz in Table 9.18 and in Table
> 9.18A, which are respectively for the down link and up link direction
> of the Repeater reflect what can be achieved with present state of the

> Repeater and a UTRA TDD BS receiver.
>
> NOTE 2: The requirements shall be reconsidered when the state of the

##### 9.2.2.7.2 Co-located Repeaters and UTRA-TDD and/or E-UTRA TDD base stations

This requirement may be applied for the protection of UTRA-TDD BS
receivers when UTRA-TDD and/or E-UTRA TDD BS and UTRA-FDD Repeater are
co-located.

##### 9.2.2.7.2.1 Minimum requirement {#minimum-requirement-5 .H6}

In the down-link direction of the Repeater the power of any spurious
emission shall not exceed:

Table 9.19: UTRA Repeater down-link spurious emissions limits for
protection of co-located UTRA TDD and/or E-UTRA TDD BS receiver

10 Modulation accuracy
======================

In this section the procedure for testing the modulation accuracy of
Repeaters is defined. This test includes EVM and peak code domain error.

10.1 Error vector magnitude
---------------------------

In this section the procedure for testing the Error Vector Magnitude
(EVM) of Repeaters is defined.

### 10.1.1 Definition and applicability

The Error Vector Magnitude is a measure of the difference between the
theoretical waveform and a modified version of the measured waveform.
The modification is done according to annex E of TS25.141. This
difference is called the error vector. The EVM result is defined as the
square root of the ratio of the mean error vector power to the modified
mean reference signal power expressed as a %. The measurement interval
is one power control group (timeslot).

### 10.1.2 Minimum Requirements

In normal conditions as specified in section 5.4.1 the Error Vector
Magnitude shall not be worse than 12,5 % as defined in TS25.106.

signal passed through the Repeater..

### 10.1.4 Method of test

#### 10.1.4.1 Initial conditions

Set-up the equipment as shown in annex A.

The test is based upon the test for the base station. Test model 1 as
described in TS25.141 is used for the definition of the signal to test
on. A signal generator providing the required signals is connected to
the input of the Repeater. The Repeater is set to operate at full gain.
The signal level is adjusted to the equivalent level to obtain the
nominal output power as declared by the manufacturer. A signal analyser
connected to the output is used to measure the EVM value.

#### 10.1.4.2 Procedure

The test has to be performed in the uplink and the downlink path of the
Repeater. The EVM has to be measured according to Annex E of TS25.141

#### 10.1.4.3 Stimulus EVM effect

The stimulus signal generator EVM will RSS with the tested repeater EVM.
The target for the recorded value is adjusted accordingly in the test
requirements.

### 10.1.5 Test requirements

In normal conditions as specified in section 5.4.1, the Error Vector
Magnitude, as defined in TS25.106, shall not exceed 13,2%.

10.2 Peak code domain error
---------------------------

In this section the procedure for testing the Peak Code Domain Error of
Repeaters is defined.

### 10.2.1 Definition and applicability

The Peak Code Domain Error is computed by projecting the error vector
onto the code domain at a specific spreading factor. The Code Domain
Error for every code in the domain is defined as the ratio of the mean
power of the projection onto that code, to the mean power of the
composite reference waveform. This ratio is expressed in dB. The Peak
Code Domain Error is defined as the maximum value for the Code Domain
Error for all codes. The measurement interval is one power control group
(timeslot).

### 10.2.2 Minimum Requirements

In normal conditions as specified in section 5.4.1 the peak code domain
error shall not exceed -35 dB at spreading factor 256 as defined in
TS25.106.

### 10.2.3 Test purpose

To verify that the peak code domain error is within the limit specified
in 10.2.2 after the signal passed through the Repeater.

### 10.2.4 Method of test

#### 10.2.4.1 Initial conditions

Set-up the equipment as shown in annex A.

The test is based upon the test for the base station. Test model 3 as
described in TS25.141 is used for the definition of the signal to test
on. A signal generator providing the required signals is connected to
the input of the Repeater. The spreading factor of the signal generator
is set to 256. The Repeater is set to operate at full gain. The signal
level is adjusted to the equivalent level to obtain the nominal output
power as declared by the manufacturer. A signal analyser connected to
the output is used to measure the peak code domain error value.

#### 10.2.4.2 Procedure

The test has to be performed in the uplink and the downlink path of the
Repeater. The peak code domain error as described in TS25.141 Annex E
has to be measured.

### 10.2.5 Test requirements

In normal conditions as specified in section 5.4.1 the peak code domain
error shall not exceed -33,9 dB at spreading factor 256 as defined in
TS25.106.

10.3 Relative Code Domain Error (RCDE) for 64QAM modulation
-----------------------------------------------------------

### 10.3.1 Definition and applicability

The Relative Code Domain Error is computed by projecting the error
vector (as defined in 10.1) onto the code domain at a specified
spreading factor. Only the active code channels in the composite
reference waveform are considered for this requirement. The Relative
Code Domain Error for every active code is defined as the ratio of the
mean power of the error projection onto that code, to the mean power of
the active code in the composite reference waveform. This ratio is
expressed in dB. The measurement interval is one frame.

The requirement for Relative Code Domain Error is only applicable for
Repeater supporting 64QAM modulated codes.

See TS25.141 \[11\] Annex E for further details.

### 10.3.2 Minimum requirement

The average Relative Code Domain Error for 64QAM modulated codes shall
not exceed -21 dB at spreading factor 16.

### 10.3.3 Test purpose

on. A signal generator providing the required signals is connected to
the input of the Repeater. The spreading factor of the signal generator
is set to 16. The Repeater is set to operate at full gain. The signal
level is adjusted to the equivalent level to obtain the nominal output
power as declared by the manufacturer. A signal analyser connected to
the output is used to measure the peak code domain error value.

#### 10.3.4.2 Procedure

The test has to be performed in the uplink and the downlink path of the
Repeater. The relative code domain error as described in TS25.141 Annex
E has to be measured.

### 10.3.5 Test requirements

In normal conditions as specified in section 5.4.1 the relative code
domain error shall not exceed -19.3 dB at spreading factor 16 as defined
in TS25.106.

11 Input intermodulation
========================

The input intermodulation is a measure of the capability of the Repeater
to inhibit the generation of interference in the pass band, in the
presence of interfering signals on frequencies other than the pass band.

11.1 Definition and applicability
---------------------------------

Third and higher order mixing of the two interfering RF signals can
produce an interfering signal in the band of the desired channel.
Intermodulation response rejection is a measure of the capability of the
Repeater to maintain the wanted frequency free of internally created
interference.

The test requirements in Tables 11.2 may be applied for the protection
of FDD Repeater input when GSM900, DCS1800, PCS1900, GSM850, E-UTRA FDD
and/or UTRA FDD BS are co-located with a UTRA FDD Repeater.

The additional test requirements in Tables 11.2AA may be applied for the
protection of FDD Repeater input when a UTRA TDD BS is co-located with a
UTRA FDD Repeater.

This test applies to uplink and downlink path of the Repeater.

11.2 Minimum Requirements
-------------------------

### 11.2.1 General requirement

In normal conditions as specified in section 5.4.1 the intermodulation
performance should be met when the following signals are applied to the
Repeater:

For the parameters specified in table 11.2 and 11.2AA, the power in the
pass band shall not increase with more than 10 dB at the output of the
repeater as measured in the centre of the pass band, compared to the
level obtained without interfering signals applied.

### 11.2.3 Co-existence with other systems

In normal conditions as specified in section 5.4.1 the intermodulation
performance should be met when the following signals are applied to the
Repeater:

For the parameters specified in table 11.2A and table 11.2AAA, the power
in the pass band shall not increase with more than 10 dB at the output
of the repeater as measured in the centre of the pass band, compared to
the level obtained without interfering signals applied.

11.3 Test purpose
-----------------

The purpose of this test is to verify that the Repeater meets the
intermodulation characteristics requirements as specified in TS 25.106,
subclause 11.1.

11.4 Method of test
-------------------

### 11.4.1 Initial conditions

1\) Set-up the equipment as shown in annex A.

2\) Set the Repeater to maximum gain.

3\) Connect two signal generators with a combining circuit or one signal
generator with the ability to generate several CW carriers to the input.

4\) Connect a spectrum analyser to the output of the Repeater. Set the
resolution bandwidth to 1 MHz in the centre of the pass band. Set
averaging to 1 second or more.

### 11.4.2 Procedure

1\) Adjust the frequency of the input signals, either below or above the
pass band, so that the lowest order intermodulation product is
positioned in the centre of the pass band, according to subclause 11.2.

2\) Take the measurement of the rise of the output signal.

3\) Repeat the measurement for the opposite path of the Repeater.

11.5 Test requirements
----------------------

### 11.5.1 Mandatory requirement

In normal conditions as specified in section 5.4.1 the intermodulation
performance should be met when the following signals are applied to the
Repeater:

Table 11.3: Input intermodulation requirement

  ----------- --------------------------- ----------------- -----------------------
  f\_offset   Interfering Signal Levels   Type of signals   Measurement bandwidth
  3,5 MHz     -40 dBm                     2 CW carriers     1 MHz
  ----------- --------------------------- ----------------- -----------------------

For the parameters specified in table 11.3, the power in the pass band
shall not increase by more than 11,2 dB at the output of the Repeater as
measured in the centre of the pass band, compared to the level obtained
without interfering signals applied.

### 11.5.2 Co-location with BS in other systems 

In normal conditions as specified in section 5.4.1 the intermodulation
performance should be met when the following signals are applied to the
Repeater:

For the parameters specified in table 11.4 and in table 11.4AA, the
power in the pass band shall not increase with more than 11,2 dB at the
output of the repeater as measured in the centre of the pass band,
compared to the level obtained without interfering signals applied.

For the parameters specified in table 11.4A and table 11.4AAA, the power
in the pass band shall not increase with more than 11,2 dB at the output
of the repeater as measured in the centre of the pass band, compared to
the level obtained without interfering signals applied.

12 Output intermodulation
=========================

The output intermodulation requirement is a measure of the ability of
the repeater to inhibit the generation of intermodulation products
signals created by the presence of an interfering signal reaching the
repeater via the output port.

12.1 Definition and applicability
---------------------------------

The output intermodulation level is the power of the intermodulation
products when a WCDMA modulated interference signal is injected into the
output port at a level of 30 dB lower than that of the wanted signal.
The frequency of the interference signal shall be ±5 MHz, ±10 MHz and
±15 MHz offset from the wanted signal, but within the frequency band
allocated for UTRA FDD downlink as specified in subclause 4.1.

The requirement is applicable for downlink signals.

The normative reference for this requirement is in TS25.106 \[12\]
section 12.

12.2 Minimum requirement
------------------------

In normal conditions as specified in section 5.4.1, the output
intermodulation level shall not exceed the out of band emission or the
spurious emission requirements of section 9.1 and 9.2.

12.3 Test purpose
-----------------

The test purpose is to verify the ability of the repeater to restrict
the generation of intermodulation products in the presence of a subject
signal on the repeater input and output ports, and an interfering signal
applied at the repeater output port.

12.4 Method of test
-------------------

### 12.4.1 Initial conditions

1\) Set-up the equipment as shown in annex A.

2\) Connect a signal generator to the input port of the Repeater for
tests of repeaters with a pass band corresponding to one 5 MHz channel.
Connect a signal generator to the circulator on the output port and make
sure the signal generator power is directed to the repeater output port.

3\) Measurements with an offset from the carrier centre frequency
between 2,515 MHz and 4,0 MHz shall use a 30 kHz measurement bandwidth.

4\) Measurements with an offset from the carrier centre frequency
between 4,0 MHz and (∆fmax -- 500 kHz) shall use a 1 MHz measurement
bandwidth. The 1MHz measurement bandwidth may be calculated by
integrating multiple 50 kHz or narrower filter measurements

> 5\) Detection mode: True RMS.

### 12.4.2 Procedures

1\) Set the Repeater to maximum gain.

2\) Set the signal generator at the repeater input port (subject signal)
to generate a signal in accordance to test model 1, TS 25.141 subclause
6.1.1.1, at the level which produce the manufacturer specified maximum
output power at maximum gain.

3\) Set the signal generator at the repeater output port (interference
signal) to generate a signal in accordance to test model 1, TS 25.141
subclause 6.1.1.1, at the level producing signal power corresponding to
30 dB below the manufacturer specified maximum output power at the
repeater output port with the specified frequency offset from the wanted
signal.

4\) Measure the emission at the specified frequencies with specified
measurement bandwidth and note that the measured value does not exceed
the specified value. Measurements in the band of the interfering signal
shall be excluded. The measurements can be limited to the power of all
third and fifth order intermodulation products.

5\) Repeat from clause 3 until interference signals ±5 MHz, ±10 MHz and
±15 MHz frequency offset from the wanted signal has been tested. Note
that interfering signals outside the UTRA-FDD allocated frequency band ,
as specifies in section 4.1. need not be tested.

12.5 Test requirements
----------------------

In all measurements, the requirements according to sections 9.1.1.5 and
the downlink requirements in section 9.2.2.1 or 9.2.2.2 shall be
fulfilled.

13 Adjacent Channel Rejection Ratio (ACRR)
==========================================

13.1 Definitions and applicability
----------------------------------

Adjacent Channel Rejection Ratio (ACRR) is the ratio of the RRC weighted
gain per carrier of the repeater in the pass band to the RRC weighted
gain of the repeater on an adjacent channel.

The requirement shall apply to the uplink and downlink of Repeater where
the donor link is maintained via antennas (over the air Repeater).

13.2 Minimum Requirements
-------------------------

In normal conditions the ACRR shall be higher than the value specified
in the Table 13.1.

Table 13.1: Repeater ACRR

The 5 MHz channel filter is only required if the WCDMA signal generator
does not fulfil the unwanted emission requirement for base stations
(TS25.141 \[11\], section 6.5) with at least 10 dB margin in the
described set-up.

######## Annex B (informative): Derivation of Test Requirements

The Test Requirements in this specification have been calculated by
relaxing the Minimum Requirements of the core specification using the
Test Tolerances defined in subclause 5.2. When the Test Tolerance is
zero, the Test Requirement will be the same as the Minimum Requirement.
When the Test Tolerance is non-zero, the Test Requirements will differ
from the Minimum Requirements, and the formula used for this relaxation
is given in table B.1.

######## Annex C (informative): Acceptable uncertainty of Test Equipment

This informative annex specifies the critical parameters of the
components of an overall Test System (e.g. signal generators, signal
analysers etc.) which are necessary when assembling a Test System which
complies with subclause 5.1 Acceptable uncertainty of Test System. These
Test Equipment parameters are fundamental to the accuracy of the overall
Test System and are unlikely to be improved upon through System
Calibration.
