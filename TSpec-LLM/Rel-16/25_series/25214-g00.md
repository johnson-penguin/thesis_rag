3 Definitions and abbreviations
===============================

3.1 Definitions
---------------

For the purposes of the present document, the following terms and
definitions apply:

**Activated uplink frequency:** For a specific UE, an uplink frequency
is said to be activated if the UE is allowed to transmit on that
frequency. The primary uplink frequency is always activated when
configured while a secondary uplink frequency has to be activated by
means of an HS-SCCH order in order to become activated. Similarly, for a
specific UE, an uplink frequency is said to be deactivated if it is
configured but disallowed by the NodeB to transmit on that frequency.

**Assisting secondary serving HS-DSCH Cell(s):** In addition to the
serving HS-DSCH cell, a cell in the secondary downlink frequency, where
the UE is configured to simultaneously monitor a HS-SCCH set and receive
HS-DSCH if it is scheduled in that cell. There can be up to two
assisting secondary serving HS-DSCH cells.

**Assisting serving HS-DSCH Cell:** In addition to the serving HS-DSCH
cell, a cell in the same frequency, where the UE is configured to
simultaneously monitor a HS-SCCH set and receive HS-DSCH if it is
scheduled in that cell.

**Cell group**: A group of (one, two or three) Multiflow mode cells that
have the same CPICH timing. The cells that belong to a cell group are
indicated by higher layers.

**Configured uplink frequency**: For a specific UE, an uplink frequency
is said to be configured if the UE has received all relevant information
from higher layers in order to perform transmission on that frequency.

**Designated non-serving HS-DSCH cell**: The non-serving HS-DSCH cell
transmitting the F-DPCH that is used to estimate the F-DPCH quality for
TPC command derivation, when the UE is configured with DPCCH2 in the
uplink or E-DCH decoupling is configured.

**DL FET:** DL FET refers to early termination of DL DPCH transmission
upon receiving an acknowledgement message. In this context, a DL FET
ACK/NACK message represents an acknowledge message sent on UL DPCCH for
DL FET.

**DL\_DCH\_FET\_Config**: Higher layers signal this configuration
parameter to indicate enhanced DCH physical layer configuration. The
possible values are 0 and 1. The value 0 indicates Mode 0 configuration
where DL transport channels concatenation and UL ACK/NACK signalling are
not configured. The value 1 indicates Mode 1 where DL transport channel
concatenation and UL ACK/NACK signalling for DL FET are configured.

**E-DCH decoupling:** An E-DCH operation mode in which the Serving
HS-DSCH cell and the Serving E-DCH cell are different.

**L1 combining period**: An interval of contiguous TTIs when S-CCPCHs,
each on different RLs, may be soft combined.

**MIMO mode:** This term refers to the downlink MIMO configuration with
two transmit antennas.

**MIMO mode with four transmit antennas:** This term refers to the
downlink MIMO configuration with four transmit antennas.

**Multiflow mode:** The UE is configured in Multiflow mode when it is
configured with an assisting serving HS-DSCH cell.

**Non-time reference cell:** An HS-DSCH cell configured for a UE in
Multiflow mode that has a different timing than the time reference cell.
If the time reference cell is the Assisting Serving HS-DSCH cell then
the non-time reference cell is the Serving HS-DSCH cell. If the time
reference cell is the Serving HS-DSCH Cell, then the non-time reference
cell is the Assisting Serving HS-DSCH cell.

**Primary uplink frequency:** If a single uplink frequency is configured
for the UE, then it is the *primary uplink frequency*. In case more than
one uplink frequency is configured for the UE, then the primary uplink
frequency is the frequency on which the E-DCH corresponding to the
serving E-DCH cell associated with the serving HS-DSCH cell is
transmitted. The association between a pair of uplink and downlink
frequencies is indicated by higher layers.

**Secondary uplink frequency:** A *secondary uplink frequency* is a
frequency on which an E-DCH corresponding to a serving E-DCH cell
associated with a secondary serving HS-DSCH cell is transmitted. The
association between a pair of uplink and downlink frequencies is
indicated by higher layers.

**SRB:** Signalling Radio Bearers as defined in \[5\].

**40ms Compression Interval (40ms CI):** A time interval of 40ms
duration aligned in time with a 40ms TTI, defined for DPCH physical
layer procedures when DCH channel is configured with a single transport
channel of 40ms TTI carrying SRB data only.

**Time reference cell:** The (Serving or Assisting Serving, but not
Secondary Serving or Assisting Secondary Serving) HS-DSCH cell that

reference cell.

**UL DPCH 10ms Mode**: When configured by higher layers for the TTI to
be transmitted \[9\], UL DPCH follows physical channel procedures

DL\_DCH\_FET\_Config is configured.

**UL DPCH 20ms Mode**: When configured by higher layers for the TTI to
be transmitted \[9\], UL DPCH is transmitted continuously over a
Compression Interval of 20ms, and follows the physical channel
procedures specific to this mode. UL DPCH 20ms Mode can only happen when
DL\_DCH\_FET\_Config is configured.

**UL 20ms Compression Interval (20ms CI):** A time interval of 20ms
duration aligned in time with a 20ms TTI, defined for UL DPCH physical
layer procedures when DL\_DCH\_FET\_Config is configured by higher
layers.

**1^st^ secondary serving HS-DSCH cell:** If the UE is configured with
two uplink frequencies, the 1^st^ secondary serving HS-DSCH cell is the
secondary serving HS-DSCH cell that is associated with the secondary
uplink frequency. If the UE is configured with a single uplink
frequency, the 1^st^ secondary serving HS-DSCH cell is a secondary
serving HS-DSCH cell whose index is indicated by higher layers.

**2^nd^ secondary serving HS-DSCH cell:** If the UE is configured with

4 Synchronization procedures
============================

4.1 Cell search
---------------

During the cell search, the UE searches for a cell and determines the
downlink scrambling code and common channel frame synchronization of
that cell. How cell search is typically done is described in Annex C.

4.2 Common physical channel synchronization
-------------------------------------------

The radio frame timing of all common physical channels can be determined
after cell search.

### 4.2.1 P-CCPCH radio frame timing

The P-CCPCH radio frame timing is found during cell search and the radio
frame timing of all common physical channel are related to that timing
as described in \[1\].

### 4.2.2 S-CCPCH soft combining timing

Higher layers will provide timing information when S-CCPCHs, each on
different RLs,can be soft combined. The timing information allows the UE
to determine the L1 combining period that applies to each S-CCPCH. The
information also identifies the S-CCPCHs and the RLs that can be soft
combined. The set of S-CCPCHs that can be combined does not change
during an L1 combining period. When S-CCPCHs can be soft combined, all
S-CCPCHs shall contain identical bits in their data fields, although the
TFCI fields of the S-CCPCHs may be different. (TFC detection when
S-CCPCHs may be soft combined is discussed in \[2\].) The maximum delay
between S-CCPCHs that the UE may combine is set by UE performance
requirements. The maximum number of S-CCPCHs that UE may simultaneously
combine is defined by the UE capability in \[10\].

### 4.2.3 Radio frame timing on the MBSFN layer

MBSFN cluster search and radio frame synchronization on the MBSFN layer
can be performed via SCH and follow the same principles as described in
Annex C. After the primary scrambling code has been identified, the
P-CCPCH can be detected and MBSFN system information can be read.

### 4.2.4 Secondary serving HS-DSCH cell timing

When the UE is configured with one or more secondary serving HS-DSCH
cells, it shall not assume the presence of any common physical channel
from these cells other than CPICH. The radio frame timing and timing
reference for each of the secondary serving HS-DSCH cells are defined in
\[1\].

### 4.2.5 HS-DSCH cell timing when Multiflow is configured

When the UE is configured in Multiflow mode, the UE shall not assume any
timing relation between the serving HS-DSCH cell and the assisting
serving HS-DSCH cell. The UE can only be configured with an assisting
serving HS-DSCH cell if that cell is contained in the UE's active set.
If the UE is also configured with multiple uplink frequencies, then the
UE can only be configured with an assisting secondary serving HS-DSCH
cell if that cell is contained in the UE's active set on the secondary
uplink frequency.

The UE may assume that the serving HS-DSCH cell and the secondary
serving HS-DSCH cell, if present, have the same radio frame timing.

The UE may assume that the assisting serving HS-DSCH cell and the
assisting secondary serving HS-DSCH cell, if present, have the same
radio frame timing.

4.3 DPCCH/DPDCH/F-DPCH synchronization
--------------------------------------

### 4.3.1 Synchronization primitives

#### 4.3.1.1 General

For the dedicated channels, synchronization primitives are used to
indicate the synchronization status of radio links, both in uplink and
downlink. The definition of the primitives is given in the following
subclauses.

#### 4.3.1.2 Downlink synchronization primitives

If UL\_DTX\_Active is FALSE (see clause 6C), layer 1 in the UE shall
every radio frame check synchronization status of either the DPCH or the
F‑DPCH depending on which is configured. If UL\_DTX\_Active is TRUE (see
clause 6C), the layer 1 in the UE shall check synchronization status of
the F-DPCH for each radio frame in which the F-DPCH transmission is
known to be present in at least one slot, and for the other radio
frames, the layer 1 will not indicate any synchronization status to the
higher layers. Synchronization status is indicated to higher layers
using the CPHY-Sync-IND and CPHY-Out-of-Sync-IND primitives.

The criteria for reporting synchronization status are defined in two
different phases. Each phase is performed by the UE for each individual
downlink frequency associated with the activated uplink frequencies. The
downlink synchronization primitives are also reported to higher layers
for each individual downlink frequency associated with the activated
uplink frequencies.

The first phase starts when higher layers initiate physical dedicated
channel establishment (as described in \[5\]) or whenever the UE
initiates synchronization procedure A or synchronization procedure AA
(as described in subclauses 4.3.2.1 and 4.3.2.3A) and lasts until 160 ms
after the downlink dedicated channel is considered established by higher
layers (physical channel establishment is defined in \[5\]). During this
time out-of-sync shall not be reported and in-sync shall be reported
using the CPHY-Sync-IND primitive if the following criterion is
fulfilled:

\- The UE estimates the DPCCH quality or the quality of the TPC fields
of the F-DPCH frame received from the associated serving HS-DSCH cell
(or secondary serving HS-DSCH cell) or the quality of the TPC fields of
the F-DPCH frame received from the serving E-DCH cell (or secondary
serving E-DCH cell) when E-DCH decoupling is configured and DPCCH2 is
not configured over the previous 40 ms period to be better than a
threshold Q~in~, or over the previous 120ms or 200ms to be better than a
threshold Q~in~ if the Algorithm 3 is configured, when the length of the
slot cycle is 3 or 5 respectively. This criterion shall be assumed not
to be fulfilled before 40 ms of DPCCH or F-DPCH quality measurements
have been collected when either the Algorithm 1 or 2 is configured, or
before 120 ms or 200 ms of F-DPCH quality measurements have been
collected if the Algorithm 3 is configured, when the length of the slot
cycle is 3 or 5 respectively. Q~in~ is defined implicitly by the
relevant tests in \[7\].

\- If both DPCCH and F-DPCH are transmitted when DPCCH2 is configured,
then the UE shall use the DPCCH for the estimation of the quality of the
TPC fields.

When DL\_DCH\_FET\_Config is configured, the UE shall indicate
UL\_DPCH\_20ms\_Mode through the TFCI information carried on the UL
DPCCH while both the UE and network transmit as per UL\_DPCH\_20ms\_Mode
lasting for 160 ms after the downlink dedicated channel is considered
established by higher layers.

The second phase starts 160 ms after the downlink dedicated channel is
considered established by higher layers. During this phase both
out-of-sync and in-sync are reported as follows.

Out-of-sync shall be reported using the CPHY-Out-of-Sync-IND primitive
if any of the following criteria is fulfilled:

\- UL\_DTX\_Active is FALSE (see clause 6C) and the UE estimates the
DPCCH quality or the quality of the TPC fields of the F-DPCH frame
received from the associated serving HS-DSCH cell (or secondary serving
HS-DSCH cell) or the quality of the TPC fields of the F-DPCH frame
received from the serving E-DCH cell (or secondary serving E-DCH cell)
when E-DCH decoupling is configured and DPCCH2 is not configured over
the previous 160 ms period to be worse than a threshold Q~out~. Q~out~
is defined implicitly by the relevant tests in \[7\]. If both DPCCH and
F-DPCH are transmitted when DPCCH2 is configured, then the UE shall use
the DPCCH for the estimation of the quality of the TPC fields.

\- If PCA has the value 3 or UL\_DTX\_Active is TRUE (see clause 6C) and
the UE estimates the quality of the TPC fields of the F-DPCH from the
associated serving HS-DSCH cell (or secondary serving HS-DSCH cell) or
the quality of the TPC fields of the F-DPCH frame received from the
serving E-DCH cell (or secondary serving E-DCH cell) when E-DCH
decoupling is configured and DPCCH2 is not configured over the previous
240 slots in which the TPC symbols are known to be present to be worse
than a threshold Q~out~. Q~out~ is defined implicitly by the relevant
tests in \[7\]. If both DPCCH and F-DPCH are transmitted when DPCCH2 is
configured, then the UE shall use the DPCCH for the estimation of the
quality of the TPC fields.

\- The 20 most recently received transport blocks with a non-zero length
CRC attached, as observed on all TrCHs using non-zero length CRC mapped
to the DPDCH, have been received with incorrect CRC. In addition, over
the previous 160 ms, all transport blocks with a non-zero length CRC
attached have been received with incorrect CRC. In case no TFCI is used
this criterion shall not be considered for the TrCH(s) not using guided
detection if they do not use a non-zero length CRC in all transport
formats. If no transport blocks with a non-zero length CRC attached are
received over the previous 160 ms this criterion shall not be assumed to
be fulfilled.

For a DPCH, in-sync shall be reported using the CPHY-Sync-IND primitive
if both of the following criteria are fulfilled:

\- The UE estimates the DPCCH quality over the previous 160 ms period to
be better than a threshold Q~in~. Q~in~ is defined implicitly by the
relevant tests in \[7\].

\- At least one transport block with a non-zero length CRC attached, as
observed on all TrCHs using non-zero length CRC mapped to the DPDCH, is
received in a TTI ending in the current frame with correct CRC. If no
transport blocks are received, or no transport block has a non-zero
length CRC attached in a TTI ending in the current frame and in addition
over the previous 160 ms at least one transport block with a non-zero
length CRC attached has been received with a correct CRC, this criterion
shall be assumed to be fulfilled. If no transport blocks with a non-zero
length CRC attached are received over the previous 160 ms this criterion
shall also be assumed to be fulfilled. In case no TFCI is used this
criterion shall not be considered for the TrCH(s) not using guided
detection if they do not use a non-zero length CRC in all transport
formats.

For a F-DPCH, in-sync shall be reported using the CPHY-Sync-IND
primitive if any of the following criteria is fulfilled:

\- UL\_DTX\_Active is FALSE (see clause 6C) and the UE estimates the
quality of the TPC fields of the F-DPCH frame received from the
associated serving HS-DSCH cell (or secondary serving HS-DSCH cell) or
the quality of the TPC fields of the F-DPCH frame received from the
serving E-DCH cell (or secondary serving E-DCH cell) when E-DCH
decoupling is configured and DPCCH2 is not configured over the previous
160 ms period to be better than a threshold Q~in~. Q~in~ is defined
implicitly by the relevant tests in \[7\].

\- If PCA has the value 3 or UL\_DTX\_Active is TRUE (see clause 6C) and
the UE estimates the quality of the TPC fields of the F-DPCH from the
associated serving HS-DSCH cell (or secondary serving HS-DSCH cell) or
the quality of the TPC fields of the F-DPCH frame received from the
serving E-DCH cell (or secondary serving E-DCH cell) when E-DCH
decoupling is configured and DPCCH2 is not configured over the previous
240 slots in which the TPC symbols are known to be present to be better
than a threshold Q~in~. Q~in~ is defined implicitly by the relevant
tests in \[7\].

\- If both DPCH and F-DPCH are transmitted when DPCCH2 is configured,
then the UE shall use the DPCH in-sync reporting procedure.

How the primitives are used by higher layers is described in \[5\]. The
above definitions may lead to radio frames where neither the in-sync nor
the out-of-sync primitives are reported.

#### 4.3.1.3 Uplink synchronization primitives

Layer 1 in the Node B shall every radio frame check synchronization
status of all radio link sets. Synchronization status is indicated to
the RL Failure/Restored triggering function using either the
CPHY-Sync-IND or CPHY-Out-of‑Sync‑IND primitive. Hence, only one
synchronization status indication shall be given per radio link set.

The exact criteria for indicating in-sync/out-of-sync is not subject to
specification, but could e.g. be based on received DPCCH or DPCCH2
quality or CRC checks. One example would be to have the same criteria as
for the downlink synchronization status primitives.

### 4.3.2 Radio link establishment and physical layer reconfiguration for dedicated channels

#### 4.3.2.1 General

Three synchronization procedures are defined in order to obtain physical
layer synchronization of dedicated channels between UE and UTRAN:

\- Synchronization procedure A: This procedure shall be used when at
least one downlink dedicated physical channel (i.e. a DPCH or F-DPCH)
and one uplink dedicated physical channel are to be set up on a
frequency and none of the radio links after the
establishment/reconfiguration existed on that frequency prior to the
establishment/reconfiguration which also includes the following cases :

\- the UE was previously on another RAT i.e. inter-RAT handover

\- the UE was previously on another frequency i.e. inter-frequency hard
handover

\- the UE has all its previous radio links removed and replaced by other
radio links i.e. intra-frequency hard-handover

\- after it fails to complete an inter-RAT, intra- or inter-frequency
hard-handover \[8\], the UE attempts to re-establish \[5\] all the
dedicated physical channels which were already established immediately
before the hard-handover attempt. In this case only steps c) and d) of
synchronization procedure A are applicable.

\- the UE receives an HS-SCCH order to activate the secondary uplink
frequency as specified in \[2\] and the UE is configured with multiple
frequencies on the uplink.

For transitions from the CELL\_FACH state of a cell to the CELL\_DCH
state of the same cell,, when synchronization has already been achieved
by a synchronization procedure AA and the UE has not already released
its uplink common E-DCH resource before the time of transition to
CELL\_DCH, the synchronization procedure A shall not be executed. Else,
the synchronization procedure A shall be executed.

\- Synchronization procedure AA: This procedure shall be used when one
downlink F-DPCH and uplink dedicated physical channels are to be set up
on a frequency as a consequence of an Enhanced Uplink in CELL\_FACH
procedure.

\- Synchronization procedure B: This procedure shall be used when one or
several radio links are added to the active set on a frequency and at
least one of the radio links prior to the establishment/reconfiguration
still exists on that frequency after the establishment/reconfiguration.

\- If higher layers indicate that the UE shall not perform any
synchronization procedure for timing maintained intra- and
inter-frequency hard handover, the UE shall not perform any of the
synchronization procedures A or B. If higher layers indicate to the Node
B timing maintained intra- or inter-frequency hard handover where the UE
does not perform any of the synchronization procedures A, AA or B, the
Node B shall perform steps a) and b) of synchronization procedure B.

For all physical layer reconfigurations not listed above, the UE and
UTRAN shall not perform any of the synchronization procedures listed
above.

The three synchronization procedures are described in subclauses
4.3.2.3, 4.3.2.3A and 4.3.2.4 respectively.

#### 4.3.2.2 Node B radio link set state machine

In Node B, each radio link set can be in three different states: initial
state, out-of-sync state and in-sync state. Transitions between the
different states are shown in figure 1 below. The state of the Node B at
the start of radio link establishment is described in the following
subclauses. Transitions between initial state and in-sync state are
described in subclauses 4.3.2.3, 4.3.2.3A and 4.3.2.4 and transitions
between the in-sync and out-of-sync states are described in
subclause 4.3.3.2.

Figure 1: Node B radio link set states and transitions

#### 4.3.2.3 Synchronization procedure A

For each configured uplink frequency, the synchronization establishment
procedure, which begins at the time indicated by higher layers (either
immediately at receipt of upper layer signalling, or at an indicated
activation time), or by an HS-SCCH order to activate the secondary
uplink frequency (in the case multiple frequencies are configured on the
uplink) is as follows:

a\) Each Node B involved in the procedure sets all the radio link sets
which are to be set-up for this UE in the initial state.

b\) UTRAN shall start the transmission of the downlink DPCCH or F-DPCH
corresponding to the activated uplink frequency and may start the
transmission of DPDCH if any data is to be transmitted. The initial
downlink DPCCH or F-DPCH transmit power is set by higher layers \[6\].
Downlink TPC commands are generated as described in 5.1.2.2.1.2.

c\) The UE establishes downlink chip and frame synchronization of DPCCH
or F-DPCH corresponding to the activated uplink frequency, using the
P-CCPCH timing and timing offset information notified from UTRAN. For
DPCH, frame synchronization can be confirmed using the frame
synchronization word. Downlink synchronization status is reported to
higher layers every radio frame according to subclause 4.3.1.2.

d\) If higher layers indicate the usage of a post-verification period
for the primary uplink frequency the UE shall start transmission on the
primary uplink frequency immediately when the physical dedicated channel
establishment is initiated by the UE. When DL\_DCH\_FET\_Config is
configured, the UE shall continue to indicate and transmit as per
UL\_DPCH\_20ms\_Mode. Post-verification period shall not be used if the
Algorithm 3 is configured. Post-verification period is always used for
the secondary uplink frequency, except when Algorithm 3 is configured,
or when DTX enhancements is configured, in which case upon successfully
receiving an HS-SCCH order to activate the secondary uplink frequency,
in-sync shall be reported, and the UE shall start transmission on the
secondary uplink frequency immediately according to the DTX settings if
configured. In this case, the synchronization status evaluation shall be
performed immediately according to the second phase of the downlink
synchronization status evaluation.

e\) If higher layers do not indicate the usage of a post-verification
period for the primary uplink frequency, or if higher layers do indicate
the usage of a post-verification period (as specified in 5.1.2.2.1.1)
and the post-verification has failed, the UE shall not transmit on the
activated uplink frequency until higher layers consider the downlink
physical channel established;

\- If no activation time for uplink DPCCH has been signalled to the UE
or if the UE attempts to re-establish the DPCH after an inter-RAT,
intra- or inter-frequency hard-handover failure \[5\], uplink DPCCH
transmission shall start on the activated uplink frequency when higher
layers consider the downlink physical channel established;

\- If an activation time has been given, uplink DPCCH transmission shall
not start on the activated uplink frequency before the downlink physical
channel has been established and the activation time has been reached.
Physical channel establishment and activation time are defined in \[5\].

e\) UTRAN establishes uplink chip and frame synchronization on the
activated uplink frequency. Frame synchronization can be confirmed using
the frame synchronization word. Radio link sets remain in the initial
state until N\_INSYNC\_IND successive in-sync indications are received
from layer 1, when Node B shall trigger the RL Restore procedure
indicating which radio link set has obtained synchronization. When RL
Restore has been triggered the radio link set shall be considered to be
in the in-sync state. The parameter value of N\_INSYNC\_IND is
configurable, see \[6\]. The RL Restore procedure may be triggered
several times, indicating when synchronization is obtained for different
radio link sets.

Note: The total signalling response delay for the establishment of a new
DPCH shall not exceed the requirements given in \[5\] subclause 13.5.

#### 4.3.2.3A Synchronization procedure AA {#a-synchronization-procedure-aa .list-paragraph}

The synchronization establishment procedure, which begins at the time
defined in \[1\] for the Enhanced Uplink in CELL\_FACH state and IDLE
mode, is as follows:

a\) The Node B involved in the procedure sets the radio link which is to
be set-up for this UE in the initial state.

b\) UTRAN shall start the transmission of the downlink F-DPCH at the
time defined for the Enhanced Uplink in CELL\_FACH state and IDLE mode
in \[1\].

c\) The UE establishes downlink chip and frame synchronization of
F-DPCH, using the P-CCPCH timing and timing offset information notified
from UTRAN and based on the timing definition for the Enhanced Uplink in
CELL\_FACH state and IDLE mode as defined in \[1\]. Downlink
synchronization status is reported to higher layers every radio frame
according to subclause 4.3.1.2.

d\) The UE shall start transmission on uplink at the time defined for
the Enhanced Uplink in CELL\_FACH state and IDLE mode in \[1\] and shall
use a post-verification period for confirming the establishment of the
downlink physical channel as follows: During the first 40 ms period of
the first phase of the downlink synchronization procedure the UE shall
control its transmitter according to a downlink F-DPCH quality criterion
as follows:

\- When the UE estimates the F-DPCH quality over the first 40 ms period
of the first phase of the downlink synchronization status evaluation to
be worse than a threshold Q~in~, the UE shall shut its transmitter off
and consider post-verification failed. Q~in~ is defined implicitly by
the relevant tests in \[7\].

> If the post-verification has failed, the UE shall not transmit on
> uplink and await higher layer orders.

e\) UTRAN establishes uplink chip and frame synchronization. Frame
synchronization can be confirmed using the frame synchronization word.

#### 4.3.2.4 Synchronization procedure B

For each configured uplink frequency, the synchronization procedure B,
which begins at the time indicated by higher layers (either immediately
at receipt of upper layer signalling, or at an indicated activation
time) is as follows:

a\) The following applies to each Node B involved in the procedure:

\- New radio link sets are set up to be in initial state.

\- If one or several radio links are added to an existing radio link
set, this radio link set shall be considered to be in the state the
radio link set was prior to the addition of the radio link, i.e. if the
radio link set was in the in-sync state before the addition of the radio
link it shall remain in that state.

b\) UTRAN starts the transmission of the downlink DPCCH/DPDCH or F-DPCH
for each new radio link for which the DPCH or F-DPCH is to be
transmitted corresponding to the activated uplink frequency at a frame
timing such that the frame timing received at the UE will be within T~0~
± 148 chips prior to the frame timing of the uplink DPCCH/DPDCH at the
UE. Simultaneously, UTRAN establishes uplink chip and frame
synchronization of each new radio link. Frame synchronization can be
confirmed using the frame synchronization word. Radio link sets
considered to be in the initial state shall remain in the initial state
until N\_INSYNC\_IND successive in-sync indications are received from
layer 1, when Node B shall trigger the RL Restore procedure indicating
which radio link set has obtained synchronization. When RL Restore is
triggered the radio link set shall be considered to be in the in-sync
state. The parameter value of N\_INSYNC\_IND is configurable, see \[6\].
The RL Restore procedure may be triggered several times, indicating when
synchronization is obtained for different radio link sets.

c\) The UE establishes chip and frame synchronization of each new radio
link. Layer 1 in the UE keeps reporting downlink synchronization status
to higher layers every radio frame according to the second phase of
subclause 4.3.1.2. For DPCH, frame synchronization can be confirmed
using the frame synchronization word for the radio link where the DPCH
is transmitted.

### 4.3.3 Radio link monitoring

#### 4.3.3.1 Downlink radio link failure

The downlink radio links where F-DPCH and/or DPCH is transmitted shall
be monitored by the UE, to trigger radio link failure procedures. The
downlink radio link failure criteria is specified in \[5\], and is based
on the synchronization status primitives CPHY-Sync-IND and
CPHY-Out-of-Sync-IND, indicating in-sync and out-of-sync respectively.

#### 4.3.3.2 Uplink radio link failure/restore in CELL\_DCH state

The uplink radio link sets are monitored by the Node B, to trigger radio
link failure/restore procedures. Once the radio link sets have been
established, they will be in the in-sync or out-of-sync states as shown
in figure 1 in subclause 4.3.2. 2. Transitions between those two states
are described below.

The uplink radio link failure/restore criteria is based on the
synchronization status primitives CPHY-Sync-IND and
CPHY-Out-of-Sync-IND, indicating in-sync and out-of-sync respectively.
Note that only one synchronization status indication shall be given per
radio link set.

When the radio link set is in the in-sync state, Node B shall start
timer T\_RLFAILURE after receiving N\_OUTSYNC\_IND consecutive
out-of-sync indications. Node B shall stop and reset timer T\_RLFAILURE
upon receiving successive N\_INSYNC\_IND in-sync indications. If
T\_RLFAILURE expires, Node B shall trigger the RL Failure procedure and
indicate which radio link set is out-of-sync. When the RL Failure
procedure is triggered, the state of the radio link set change to the
out-of-sync state.

When the radio link set is in the out-of-sync state, after receiving
N\_INSYNC\_IND successive in-sync indications Node B shall trigger the
RL Restore procedure and indicate which radio link set has
re-established synchronization. When the RL Restore procedure is
triggered, the state of the radio link set change to the in-sync state.

The specific parameter settings (values of T\_RLFAILURE,
N\_OUTSYNC\_IND, and N\_INSYNC\_IND) are configurable, see \[6\].

#### 4.3.3.2A Uplink radio link failure/restore in CELL\_FACH state and IDLE mode {#a-uplink-radio-link-failurerestore-in-cell_fach-state-and-idle-mode .list-paragraph}

The uplink radio link failure/restore is under the control of the Node
B.

### 4.3.4 Transmission timing adjustments

During a connection the UE may adjust its DPDCH/DPCCH transmission time
instant.

When the UE autonomously adjusts its DPDCH/DPCCH transmission time
instant, it shall simultaneously adjust the HS-DPCCH, DPCCH2, E-DPCCH,
E-DPDCH, S-DPCCH, S-E-DPCCH and S-E-DPDCH transmission time instant by
the same amount so that the relative timing between DPCCH/DPDCH/DPCCH2
and HS-DPCCH is kept constant and that DPCCH/DPDCH and DPCCH2 and
E-DPCCH/E-DPDCH and S-DPCCH and S-E-DPCCH/S-E-DPDCH remain time aligned.

If the receive timing for any downlink DPCCH/DPDCH or F-DPCH in the
current active set has drifted, so the time between reception of the
downlink DPCCH/DPDCH in question and transmission of uplink DPCCH/DPDCH
lies outside the valid range, L1 shall inform higher layers of this, so
that the network can be informed of this and downlink timing can be
adjusted by the network.

The maximum rate of uplink TX time adjustment, and the valid range for
the time between downlink DPCCH/DPDCH or F-DPCH reception and uplink
DPCCH/DPDCH transmission in the UE are defined by the requirements
specified in \[8\].

When the UE's time reference cell for HSDPA Multiflow is changed, the UE
shall adjust its HS-DPCCH transmission timing to comply with the
definitions in \[1\].

5 Power control
===============

5.1 Uplink power control
------------------------

### 5.1.1 PRACH

#### 5.1.1.1 General

The power control during the physical random access procedure is
described in clause 6. The setting of power of the message control and
data parts is described in the next subclause.

#### 5.1.1.2 Setting of PRACH control and data part power difference

The message part of the uplink PRACH channel shall employ gain factors
to control the control/data part relative power similar to the uplink
dedicated physical channels. Hence, subclause 5.1.2.5 applies also for
the RACH message part, with the differences that:

\- *β~c~* is the gain factor for the control part (similar to DPCCH);

\- *β~d~* is the gain factor for the data part (similar to DPDCH);

\- no inner loop power control is performed.

### 5.1.2 DPCCH/DPDCH/DPCCH2

#### 5.1.2.1 General

The initial uplink DPCCH transmit power is set by higher layers.
Subsequently the uplink transmit power control procedure simultaneously
and independently controls the power of a DPCCH on each activated uplink
frequency and its corresponding DPDCHs (if present). The relative
transmit power offset between DPCCH and DPDCHs is determined by the
network and is computed according to subclause 5.1.2.5 using the gain
factors signalled to the UE using higher layer signalling.

The operation of the inner power control loop, described in sub clause
5.1.2.2, adjusts the power of the DPCCH and DPDCHs by the same amount,
provided there are no changes in gain factors. Additional adjustments to
the power of the DPCCH associated with the use of compressed mode are
described in sub clause 5.1.2.3.

Any change in the uplink DPCCH transmit power shall take place
immediately before the start of the pilot field on the DPCCH. The change
in DPCCH power with respect to its previous value is derived by the UE
and is denoted by ∆~DPCCH~ (in dB). The previous value of DPCCH power
shall be that used in the previous slot, except in the event of an
interruption in transmission due to the use of compressed mode or
discontinuous uplink DPCCH transmission operation, when the previous
value shall be that used in the last slot before the transmission gap.
If the DTX enhancements is configured, the initial UL DPCCH transmit
power value after a transmission gap on the secondary uplink carrier if
configured, shall be calculated according to subclause 5.1.2.2.1.3.

During the operation of the uplink power control procedure the UE
transmit power shall not exceed a maximum allowed value which is the
lower out of the maximum output power of the terminal power class and a
value which may be set by higher layer signalling.

Uplink power control shall be performed while the UE transmit power is
below the maximum allowed output power.

The provisions for power control at the maximum allowed value and below
the required minimum output power (as defined in \[7\]) are described in
subclause 5.1.2.6.

If DPCCH2 is configured, the initial uplink DPCCH2 transmit power is
computed (in dB) as

Uplink DPCCH2 transmit power = P~DPCCH~ + UE\_DPCCH2\_Tx\_Power\_Offset

where P~DPCCH~ is the DPCCH transmit power on the primary uplink
frequency at the start of the transmission of DPCCH2 and
UE\_DPCCH2\_Tx\_Power\_Offset is set by higher layers.

The power control procedure for DPCCH2 is described in sub clause
5.1.2.2A.

#### 5.1.2.2 Ordinary transmit power control

##### 5.1.2.2.1 General

For each activated uplink frequency, the uplink inner-loop power control
adjusts the UE transmit power in order to keep the received uplink
signal‑to‑interference ratio (SIR) on that frequency at a given SIR
target, SIR~target~.

The cells in the active set should estimate signal-to-interference ratio
SIR~est~ of the received uplink DPCH. The cells in the active set should
then generate TPC commands and transmit the commands once per slot or
once per slot cycle if Algorithm 3 is configured according to the
following rule: if SIR~est~ \> SIR~target~ then the TPC command to
transmit is \"0\", while if SIR~est~ \< SIR~target~ then the TPC command
to transmit is \"1\". When UL\_DTX\_Active is TRUE (see clause 6C) or
DL\_DCH\_FET\_Config is configured, a TPC command is not required to be
transmitted in any downlink slot starting during an uplink DPCCH slot
which is in an uplink DPCCH transmission gap as defined in subclause
6C.2, in which case it is not known to be present. When
DL\_DCH\_FET\_Config is configured, a TPC command is also required to be
transmitted on the first slot of a downlink radio frame, when the
corresponding uplink radio frame is transmitted after a transmission
gap.

Upon reception of one or more TPC commands in a TPC command combining
period, the UE shall derive a single TPC command, TPC\_cmd, for each TPC
command combining period in which a TPC command is known to be present,
combining multiple TPC commands if more than one is received in a TPC
command combining period. The TPC command combining period has a length
of one slot, beginning at the downlink slot boundary for DPCH, and 512
chips after the downlink slot boundary for F-DPCH.

The UE shall ignore any TPC commands received in an F-DPCH or DPCH slot
starting during an uplink DPCCH slot which is in an uplink DPCCH
transmission gap as defined in subclause 6C.2. When DL\_DCH\_FET\_Config
is configured, the UE shall not ignore the TPC command received in the
first DPCH slot of a downlink radio frame, when the corresponding uplink
radio frame is transmitted after an uplink transmission gap.

Further, in case of an uplink DPCCH transmission gap as defined in
subclause 6C.2, the UE shall add together the values of TPC\_cmd derived
from each TPC command combining period in which a TPC command is known
to be present and is not ignored as described above and which cannot be
applied before the uplink DPCCH transmission gap, and apply the
resulting sum of TPC\_cmd values when the uplink DPCCH transmission
resumes.

Three algorithms shall be supported by the UE for deriving a TPC\_cmd.
Which of these three algorithms is used is determined by a UE-specific
higher-layer parameter, \"PowerControlAlgorithm\", and is under the
control of the UTRAN. If \"PowerControlAlgorithm\" indicates
\"algorithm1\", then the layer 1 parameter PCA shall take the value 1,
if \"PowerControlAlgorithm\" indicates \"algorithm2\" then PCA shall
take the value 2 and if \"PowerControlAlgorithm\" indicates
\"algorithm3\" then PCA shall take the value 3.

If PCA has the value 1, Algorithm 1, described in subclause 5.1.2.2.2,
shall be used for processing TPC commands.

If PCA has the value 2, Algorithm 2, described in subclause 5.1.2.2.3,
shall be used for processing TPC commands unless UE\_DTX\_DRX\_Enabled
is TRUE or DL\_DCH\_FET\_Config is configured, in which case Algorithm 1
shall be used for processing TPC commands.

If PCA has the value 3, Algorithm 3, described in subclause 5.1.2.2.4,
shall be used for processing TPC commands unless UE\_DTX\_DRX\_Enabled
is TRUE, in which case Algorithm 1 shall be used for processing TPC
commands. The Algorithm 3 can only be configured with the F-DPCH.

The step size ∆~TPC~ is a layer 1 parameter which is derived from the
UE-specific higher-layer parameter \"TPC-StepSize\" which is under the
control of the UTRAN. If \"TPC-StepSize\" has the value \"dB1\", then
the layer 1 parameter ∆~TPC~ shall take the value 1 dB and if
\"TPC-StepSize\" has the value \"dB2\", then ∆~TPC~ shall take the value
2 dB. The parameter \"TPC-StepSize\" only applies to Algorithm 1 and
Algorithm 3 as stated in \[5\]. For Algorithm 2 ∆~TPC~ shall always take
the value 1 dB.

The length of slot cycle *X* in Algorithm 3 is a layer 1 parameter which
is derived from higher layer parameter \"Decimation Factor\" which is
under the control of the UTRAN. If \"Decimation Factor\" has the value
\"3-slot cycle\", then the layer 1 parameter *X* shall take the value 3
and if \"Decimation Factor\" has the value \"5-slot cycle \", then *X*
shall take the value 5. The parameter \"Decimation Factor\" only applies
to Algorithm 3 as stated in \[5\]. If Algorithm 3 is configured, the TPC
command is not known to be present in *X-1* slots where the TPC command
is not received.

After deriving of the combined TPC command TPC\_cmd using one of the
three supported algorithms, the UE shall adjust the transmit power of
the uplink DPCCH with a step of ∆~DPCCH~ (in dB) which is given by:

∆~DPCCH~ = ∆~TPC~ × TPC\_cmd.

##### 5.1.2.2.1.1 Out of synchronization handling {#out-of-synchronization-handling .H6}

After 160 ms after physical channel establishment (defined in \[5\]) or
immediately on the secondary uplink frequency if DTX enhancements is
configured, the UE shall independently control its transmitter on each
activated uplink frequency according to a downlink DPCCH or F-DPCH
quality criterion on the associated downlink frequency as follows:

\- If UL\_DTX\_Active is FALSE (see clause 6C), the UE shall stop
transmitting on the associated uplink frequency when the UE estimates
the DPCCH or F-DPCH quality over the last 160 ms period to be worse than
a threshold Q~out~. If UL\_DTX\_Active is TRUE (see clause 6C) or if PCA
has the value 3, the UE shall stop transmitting on the associated uplink
frequency when the UE estimates the quality of the TPC fields of the
F-DPCH from the serving HS-DSCH cell (or secondary serving HS-DSCH cell)
or the quality of the TPC fields of the F-DPCH from the serving E-DCH
cell (or secondary serving E-DCH cell) in case of E-DCH decoupling is
configured and DPCCH2 is not configured over the last 240 slots in which
the TPC symbols are known to be present to be worse than a threshold
Q~out~. Q~out~ is defined implicitly by the relevant tests in \[7\].

\- If UL\_DTX\_Active is FALSE (see clause 6C), the UE can start
transmitting on the associated uplink frequency again when the UE
estimates the DPCCH or F-DPCH quality over the last 160 ms period to be
better than a threshold Q~in.~ If UL\_DTX\_Active is TRUE (see clause
6C) or if PCA has the value 3, the UE can start transmitting on the
associated uplink frequency again when the UE estimates the quality of
the TPC fields of the F-DPCH from the serving HS-DSCH cell (or secondary
serving HS-DSCH cell) or the quality of the TPC fields of the F-DPCH
from the serving E-DCH cell (or secondary serving E-DCH cell) in case of
E-DCH decoupling is configured and DPCCH2 is not configured over the
last 240 slots in which the TPC symbols are known to be present to be
better than a threshold Q~in~. Q~in~ is defined implicitly by the
relevant tests in \[7\]. When transmission is resumed, the power of the
DPCCH shall be the same as when the UE transmitter was shut off.

\- If both DPCCH and F-DPCH are transmitted when DPCCH2 is configured,
then the UE shall use the DPCCH for determination of the quality
criterion.

If higher layers indicate the usage of a post-verification period, the
UE shall independently control its transmitter on each activated uplink
frequency according to a downlink DPCCH or F-DPCH quality criterion on
the associated downlink frequency as follows:

\- When the UE estimates the DPCCH or F-DPCH quality over the first 40
ms period of the first phase of the downlink synchronization status
evaluation to be worse than a threshold Q~in~, the UE shall stop
transmitting on the associated uplink frequency and consider
post-verification failed. Q~in~ is defined implicitly by the relevant
tests in \[7\]. When the UE transmission is resumed, the transmission of
the uplink DPCCH power control preamble shall start N~pcp~ radio frames
prior to the start of uplink DPDCH transmission, where N~pcp~ is a
higher layer parameter set by UTRAN \[5\].

In case F-DPCH is configured in the downlink, the F-DPCH quality
criterion shall be estimated as explained in subclause 4.3.1.2.

##### 5.1.2.2.1.2 TPC command generation on downlink during RL initialisation {#tpc-command-generation-on-downlink-during-rl-initialisation .H6}

When commanded by higher layers the TPC commands sent on a downlink
radio link from Node Bs that have not yet achieved uplink
synchronization shall follow a pattern as follows:

If higher layers indicate by \"First RLS indicator\" that the radio link
is part of the first radio link set sent to the UE or if the radio link
initialisation is caused by an HS-SCCH order to activate the secondary
uplink frequency and the value \'n\' obtained from the parameter \"DL
TPC pattern 01 count\" passed by higher layers is different from 0 then
:

\- the TPC pattern shall consist of n instances of the pair of TPC
commands (\"0\" ,\"1\"), followed by one instance of TPC command \"1\",
where (\"0\",\"1\") indicates the TPC commands to be transmitted in 2
consecutive slots in which the TPC symbols are known to be present,

\- the TPC pattern continuously repeat but shall be forcibly re-started
at the beginning of each frame where CFN mod 4 = 0.

else

\- The TPC pattern shall consist only of TPC commands \"1\".

The TPC pattern shall terminate once uplink synchronization is achieved.

##### 5.1.2.2.1.3 Initial uplink DPCCH power handling after discontinuous transmission for the activated secondary uplink frequency  {#initial-uplink-dpcch-power-handling-after-discontinuous-transmission-for-the-activated-secondary-uplink-frequency .H6}

If the UE is configured with DTX enhancements, when a secondary uplink
frequency is activated, the UE shall set the initial DPCCH power after a
transmission gap for the secondary uplink frequency as follows:

\- If the DPCCH transmission gap on the secondary uplink frequency is
greater than the Inactivity\_Threshold\_for\_Reset\_DPCCH\_Power, then
the initial DPCCH transmit power after transmission gap on the secondary
uplink frequency is computed (in dB) as:

> P~DPCCH,2~ = P~DPCCH,1,filtered~ +
> Secondary\_Power\_Offset\_After\_Gap
>
> where the P~DPCCH,1,filtered~ is the most recent filtered DPCCH power
> on the primary uplink frequency, which shall be updated on a per-slot
> basis according to the following:
>
> where P~DPCCH,1~(i) denotes the primary uplink frequency DPCCH power
> in slot i. When there is no uplink DPCCH transmission on the primary
> frequency as defined in subclause 6C.2, the UE shall not update
> P~DPCCH,1,filtered~. The filter coefficient$\alpha$is defined
> as$\alpha = \text{1/4}^{k}$, where k is an integer number which is set
> by higher layer. The parameters of
> Inactivity\_Threshold\_for\_Reset\_DPCCH\_Power and
> Secondary\_Power\_Offset\_After\_Gap are parameters signalled by the
> network as defined in \[5\]. The filtering on the primary frequency
> shall be started when the secondary uplink frequency is activated.

\- Otherwise, the initial DPCCH transmit power after the gap shall be
set to the previous DPCCH power value used in the last slot before the
transmission gap.

##### 5.1.2.2.2 Algorithm 1 for processing TPC commands

##### 5.1.2.2.2.1 Derivation of TPC\_cmd when only one TPC command is received in each slot {#derivation-of-tpc_cmd-when-only-one-tpc-command-is-received-in-each-slot .H6}

When a UE is not in soft handover, only one TPC command will be received
in each slot in which a TPC command is known to be present. In this
case, the value of TPC\_cmd shall be derived as follows:

\- If the received TPC command is equal to 0 then TPC\_cmd for that slot
is --1.

\- If the received TPC command is equal to 1, then TPC\_cmd for that
slot is 1.

##### 5.1.2.2.2.2 Combining of TPC commands from radio links of the same radio link set {#combining-of-tpc-commands-from-radio-links-of-the-same-radio-link-set .H6}

When a UE is in soft handover, multiple TPC commands may be received in
each slot in which a TPC command is known to be present from different
cells in the active set. In some cases, the UE has the knowledge that
some of the transmitted TPC commands in a TPC command combining period
are the same. This is the case when the radio links are in the same
radio link set. For these cases, the TPC commands from the same radio
link set in the same TPC command combining period shall be combined into
one TPC command, to be further combined with other TPC commands as
described in subclause 5.1.2.2.2.3.

##### 5.1.2.2.2.3 Combining of TPC commands from radio links of different radio link sets {#combining-of-tpc-commands-from-radio-links-of-different-radio-link-sets .H6}

This subclause describes the general scheme for combination of the TPC
commands associated with the uplink DPCCH from radio links of different
radio link sets and for which the TPC command is transmitted.

First, the UE shall for each TPC command combining period conduct a soft
symbol decision W~i~ on each of the power control commands TPC~i~, where
i = 1, 2, ..., N, where N is greater than 1 and is the number of TPC
commands from radio links of different radio link sets, that may be the
result of a first phase of combination according to subclause
5.1.2.2.2.2.

Finally, the UE derives a combined TPC command, TPC\_cmd, as a function
γ of all the N soft symbol decisions W~i~:

\- TPC\_cmd = γ (W~1~, W~2~, ... W~N~), where TPC\_cmd can take the
values 1 or -1.

The function γ shall fulfil the following criteria:

If the N TPC~i~ commands are random and uncorrelated, with equal
probability of being transmitted as \"0\" or \"1\", the probability that
the output of γ is equal to 1 shall be greater than or equal to
1/(2^N^), and the probability that the output of γ is equal to -1 shall
be greater than or equal to 0.5. Further, the output of γ shall equal 1
if the TPC commands from all the radio link sets, that are not ignored
according to subclause 5.1.2.2.1 or 5.1.2.3 are reliably \"1\", and the
output of γ shall equal --1 if a TPC command from any of the radio link
sets, that are not ignored according to subclause 5.1.2.2.1 or 5.1.2.3
is reliably \"0\".

##### 5.1.2.2.3 Algorithm 2 for processing TPC commands

NOTE: Algorithm 2 makes it possible to emulate smaller step sizes than
the minimum power control step specified in subclause 5.1.2.2.1, or to
turn off uplink power control by transmitting an alternating series of
TPC commands.

##### 5.1.2.2.3.1 Derivation of TPC\_cmd when only one TPC command is received in each slot {#derivation-of-tpc_cmd-when-only-one-tpc-command-is-received-in-each-slot-1 .H6}

When a UE is not in soft handover, only one TPC command will be received
in each slot. In this case, the UE shall process received TPC commands
on a 5-slot cycle, where the sets of 5 slots shall be aligned to the
frame boundaries and there shall be no overlap between each set of 5
slots.

The value of TPC\_cmd shall be derived as follows:

\- For the first 4 slots of a set, TPC\_cmd = 0.

\- For the fifth slot of a set, the UE uses hard decisions on each of
the 5 received TPC commands as follows:

\- If all 5 hard decisions within a set are 1 then TPC\_cmd = 1 in the
5^th^ slot.

\- If all 5 hard decisions within a set are 0 then TPC\_cmd = -1 in the
5^th^ slot.

\- Otherwise, TPC\_cmd = 0 in the 5^th^ slot.

##### 5.1.2.2.3.2 Combining of TPC commands from radio links of the same radio link set {#combining-of-tpc-commands-from-radio-links-of-the-same-radio-link-set-1 .H6}

When a UE is in soft handover, multiple TPC commands may be received in
each slot from different cells in the active set. In some cases, the UE
has the knowledge that some of the transmitted TPC commands in a TPC
command combining period are the same. This is the case when the radio
links are in the same radio link set. For these cases, the TPC commands
from radio links of the same radio link set in the same TPC command
combining period shall be combined into one TPC command, to be processed
and further combined with any other TPC commands as described in
subclause 5.1.2.2.3.3.

##### 5.1.2.2.3.3 Combining of TPC commands from radio links of different radio link sets {#combining-of-tpc-commands-from-radio-links-of-different-radio-link-sets-1 .H6}

This subclause describes the general scheme for combination of the TPC
commands from radio links of different radio link sets.

The UE shall make a hard decision on the value of each TPC~i~, where
i = 1, 2, ..., N and N is the number of TPC commands from radio links of
different radio link sets, that may be the result of a first phase of
combination according to subclause 5.1.2.2.3.2.

The UE shall follow this procedure for 5 consecutive TPC command
combining periods, resulting in N hard decisions for each of the 5 TPC
command combining periods.

The sets of 5 TPC command combining periods shall for DPCH be aligned to
the frame boundaries and for F-DPCH be aligned to 512 chips offset from
the frame boundaries, and there shall be no overlap between each set of
5 TPC command combining periods.

The value of TPC\_cmd is zero for the first 4 TPC command combining
periods. After 5 TPC command combining periods have elapsed, the UE
shall determine the value of TPC\_cmd for the fifth TPC command
combining period in the following way:

The UE first determines one temporary TPC command, TPC\_temp~i~, for
each of the N sets of 5 TPC commands as follows:

\- If all 5 hard decisions within a set are \"1\", TPC\_temp~i~ = 1.

\- If all 5 hard decisions within a set are \"0\", TPC\_temp~i~ = -1.

\- Otherwise, TPC\_temp~i~ = 0.

Finally, the UE derives a combined TPC command for the fifth TPC command
combining period, TPC\_cmd, as a function γ of all the N temporary power
control commands TPC\_temp~i~:

TPC\_cmd(5^th^ TPC command combining period) = γ (TPC\_temp~1~,
TPC\_temp~2~, ..., TPC\_temp~N~), where TPC\_cmd(5^th^ TPC command
combining period) can take the values 1, 0 or --1, and γ is given by the
following definition:

\- TPC\_cmd is set to -1 if any of TPC\_temp~1~ to TPC\_temp~N~ are
equal to -1.

\- Otherwise, TPC\_cmd is set to 1
if$\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i = 1}^{N}\text{TPC}_{\text{temp}_{i}} > 0\text{.}5$.

\- Otherwise, TPC\_cmd is set to 0.

##### 5.1.2.2.4 Algorithm 3 for processing TPC commands

##### 5.1.2.2.4.1 Derivation of TPC\_cmd when only one TPC command is received in each slot cycle {#derivation-of-tpc_cmd-when-only-one-tpc-command-is-received-in-each-slot-cycle .H6}

When a UE is not in soft handover, only one TPC command will be received
in each slot cycle, where the sets of X slots shall be aligned to the
frame boundaries and there shall be no overlap between each set of X
slots.

In the initial radio link configuration, within each slot cycle, the UE
receives one TPC command in the first F-DPCH slot with one of the slot
formats from \#1 to \#8 or in the second F-DPCH slot with one of the
slot formats \#9 and \#0.

If it is not the initial radio link configuration, within each slot
cycle, if the slot position or the slot format is not indicated by
higher layers, there is no change in the F-DPCH slot position or slot
format where the UE receives the TPC command. Otherwise the UE receives
one TPC command in the F-DPCH slot position and slot format which is
indicated by higher layers.

In this case, the value of TPC\_cmd shall be derived as follows:

\- If the received TPC command is equal to 0 then TPC\_cmd for that slot
is --1.

\- If the received TPC command is equal to 1, then TPC\_cmd for that
slot is 1.

\- In the slots when no TPC command is received, TPC\_cmd = 0.

##### 5.1.2.2.4.2 Combining of TPC commands from radio links of the same radio link set {#combining-of-tpc-commands-from-radio-links-of-the-same-radio-link-set-2 .H6}

When a UE is in soft handover, multiple TPC commands may be received in
each slot cycle in which a TPC command is known to be present from
different cells in the active set. In some cases, the UE has the
knowledge that some of the transmitted TPC commands in a TPC command
combining period are the same. This is the case when the radio links are
in the same radio link set.

Within each slot cycle, the UE receives one TPC command in the F-DPCH
slot which may be indicated by higher layers with any slot formats.

There is only one TPC combining period associated to Algorithm 3 in each
slot cycle. The TPC combining period is determined by the TPC symbol
position of the existing radio link configured with Algorithm 3.

When a new radio link configured with Algorithm 3 is added, the UE
receives the TPC command of the new radio link in the existing TPC
combining period. The existing TPC combining period is determined by the
TPC symbol position of the existing radio link configured with Algorithm
3.

For these cases, the TPC commands from the same radio link set in the
same TPC command combining period shall be combined into one TPC
command, to be further combined with other TPC commands as described in
subclause 5.1.2.2.4.3.

##### 5.1.2.2.4.3 Combining of TPC commands from radio links of different radio link sets {#combining-of-tpc-commands-from-radio-links-of-different-radio-link-sets-2 .H6}

This subclause describes the general scheme for combination of the TPC
commands associated with the uplink DPCCH from radio links of different
radio link sets where at least one radio link is configured with
Algorithm 3 and for which the TPC command is transmitted. For the radio
link configured with Algorithm 3, within each slot cycle, the UE
receives one TPC command in the F-DPCH slot which may be indicated by
higher layers with any slot format.

There is only one TPC combining period associated to Algorithm 3 in each
slot cycle. The TPC combining period is determined by the TPC symbol
position of the existing radio link configured with Algorithm 3.

When a new radio link configured with Algorithm 3 is added, the UE
receives the TPC command of the new radio link in the existing TPC
combining period. The existing TPC combining period is determined by the
TPC symbol position of the existing radio link configured with Algorithm
3.

First, in the TPC command combining period associated to Algorithm 3,
the UE shall conduct a soft symbol decision W~i~ on each of the power
control commands TPC~i~, where i = 1, 2, ..., N, where N is greater than
1 and is the number of TPC commands from radio links of different radio
link sets, that may be the result of a first phase of combination
according to subclause 5.1.2.2.4.2.

Finally, the value of TPC\_cmd is 0 for the TPC command combing period
not associated to Algorithm 3, while for the TPC command combining
period associated to Algorithm 3, the UE derives a combined TPC command,
TPC\_cmd, as a function γ of all the N soft symbol decisions W~i~:

\- TPC\_cmd = γ (W~1~, W~2~, ... W~N~), where TPC\_cmd can take the
values 1 or -1.

The function γ shall fulfil the following criteria:

If the N TPC~i~ commands are random and uncorrelated, with equal
probability of being transmitted as \"0\" or \"1\", the probability that
the output of γ is equal to 1 shall be greater than or equal to
1/(2^N^), and the probability that the output of γ is equal to -1 shall
be greater than or equal to 0.5. Further, the output of γ shall equal 1
if the TPC commands from all the radio link sets, that are not ignored
according to subclause 5.1.2.2.1 or 5.1.2.3 are reliably \"1\", and the
output of γ shall equal --1 if a TPC command from any of the radio link
sets, that are not ignored according to subclause 5.1.2.2.1 or 5.1.2.3
is reliably \"0\".

#### 5.1.2.2A Ordinary transmit power control for DPCCH2

For the primary uplink frequency, the uplink inner-loop power control
for DPCCH2 adjusts the uplink DPCCH2 transmit power in order to maintain
reliable reception of DPCCH2.

The HS-DSCH serving cell in the active set monitors the DPCCH2 quality
and provides TPC commands to adjust the uplink DPCCH2 transmit power. To
increase the UE transmit power of DPCCH2 the TPC command to transmit is
\"1\", and to decrease the power the TPC command to transmit is "0".

The TPC command associated with DPCCH2 is not required to be transmitted
in any downlink slot starting during an uplink DPCCH2 slot in which the
DPCCH2 is not transmitted.

Algorithm 1 as described in subclause 5.1.2.2.2.1, shall be used for
processing TPC commands associated with DPCCH2, i.e. only one TPC
command is received in each slot from the HS-DSCH serving cell.

After deriving the TPC command TPC\_cmd associated with DPCCH2, the UE
shall adjust the transmit power of the uplink DPCCH2 with a step of
∆~DPCCH2~ (in dB) which is given by:

∆~DPCCH2~ = ∆~TPC~ × TPC\_cmd,

where ∆~TPC~ is 1 dB.

#### 5.1.2.3 Transmit power control in compressed mode

NOTE: "Transmission gaps" correspond to transmission gaps created as a
result of compressed mode. Another type of transmission gap may exist if
DPCCH discontinuous transmission is applied (as described in clause 6C),
however these gaps are named "uplink DPCCH transmission gaps".

In compressed mode, one or more transmission gap pattern sequences are
active. Therefore some frames are compressed and contain transmission
gaps. The uplink power control procedure is as specified in subclause
5.1.2.2, using the same UTRAN supplied parameters for Power Control
Algorithm and step size (∆~TPC~), but with additional features which aim
to recover as rapidly as possible a signal-to-interference ratio (SIR)
close to the target SIR after each transmission gap.

The cells in the active set should estimate signal-to-interference ratio
SIR~est~ of the received uplink DPCH. The cells in the active set should
then generate TPC commands and transmit the commands once per slot,
except during downlink transmission gaps, according to the following
rule: if SIR~est~ \> SIR~cm\_target~ then the TPC command to transmit is
\"0\", while if SIR~est~ \< SIR~cm\_target~ then the TPC command to
transmit is \"1\".

SIR~cm\_target~ is the target SIR during compressed mode and fulfils

SIR~cm\_target~ = SIR~target~ + ∆SIR~PILOT~ + ∆SIR1\_coding +
∆SIR2\_coding,

where ∆SIR1\_coding and ∆SIR2\_coding are computed from uplink
parameters DeltaSIR1, DeltaSIR2, DeltaSIRafter1, DeltaSIRafter2
signalled by higher layers as:

\- ∆SIR1\_coding = DeltaSIR1 if the start of the first transmission gap
in the transmission gap pattern is within the current uplink frame and
UE\_DTX\_DRX\_Enabled is FALSE for the UE.

\- ∆SIR1\_coding = DeltaSIRafter1 if the current uplink frame just
follows a frame containing the start of the first transmission gap in
the transmission gap pattern and UE\_DTX\_DRX\_Enabled is FALSE for the
UE.

\- ∆SIR2\_coding = DeltaSIR2 if the start of the second transmission gap
in the transmission gap pattern is within the current uplink frame and
UE\_DTX\_DRX\_Enabled is FALSE for the UE.

\- ∆SIR2\_coding = DeltaSIRafter2 if the current uplink frame just
follows a frame containing the start of the second transmission gap in
the transmission gap pattern and UE\_DTX\_DRX\_Enabled is FALSE for the
UE.

\- ∆SIR1\_coding = 0 dB and ∆SIR2\_coding = 0 dB in all other cases.

∆SIR~PILOT~ is defined as: ∆SIR~PILOT~ = 10Log~10~
(N~pilot,N~/N~pilot,curr\_frame~),

where *N~pilot,curr\_frame~* is the number of pilot bits per slot in the
current uplink frame, and *N~pilot,N~* is the number of pilot bits per
slot in a normal uplink frame without a transmission gap.

In the case of several compressed mode pattern sequences being used
simultaneously, ∆SIR1\_coding and ∆SIR2\_coding offsets are computed for
each compressed mode pattern and all ∆SIR1\_coding and ∆SIR2\_coding
offsets are summed together.

In compressed mode, compressed frames may occur in either the uplink or
the downlink or both. In uplink compressed frames, the transmission of
uplink DPDCH(s), DPCCH and DPCCH2 shall both be stopped during
transmission gaps.

Due to the transmission gaps in compressed frames, there may be missing
TPC commands in the downlink. If no downlink TPC command is transmitted,
the corresponding TPC\_cmd derived by the UE shall be set to zero.

Compressed and non-compressed frames in the uplink DPCCH may have a
different number of pilot bits per slot. A change in the transmit power
of the uplink DPCCH would be needed in order to compensate for the
change in the total pilot energy. Therefore at the start of each slot
the UE shall derive the value of a power offset$\Delta$~PILOT~. If the
number of pilot bits per slot in the uplink DPCCH is different from its
value in the most recently transmitted slot,$\Delta$~PILOT~ (in dB)
shall be given by:

$\Delta$~PILOT~ = 10Log~10~ (N~pilot,prev~/N~pilot,curr~);

where *N~pilot,prev~* is the number of pilot bits in the most recently
transmitted slot , and *N~pilot,curr~* is the number of pilot bits in
the current slot. Otherwise, including during transmission gaps in the
downlink, $\Delta$~PILOT~ shall be zero.

Unless otherwise specified, in every slot during compressed mode the UE
shall adjust the transmit power of the uplink DPCCH with a step of
∆~DPCCH~ (in dB) which is given by:

∆~DPCCH~ = ∆~TPC~ × TPC\_cmd + $\Delta$~PILOT.~

At the start of the first slot after an uplink or downlink transmission
gap the UE shall apply a change in the transmit power of the uplink
DPCCH by an amount ∆~DPCCH~ (in dB), with respect to the uplink DPCCH
power in the most recently transmitted uplink slot, where:

∆~DPCCH~ = $\Delta$~RESUME~ +$\Delta$~PILOT.~

The value of $\Delta$~RESUME~ (in dB) shall be determined by the UE
according to the Initial Transmit Power mode (ITP). The ITP is a UE
specific parameter, which is signalled by the network with the other
compressed mode parameters (see \[4\]). The different modes are
summarised in table 1.

Table 1: Initial Transmit Power modes during compressed mode

  ----------------------------- -------------------------------------------
  Initial Transmit Power mode   Description
  0                             $\Delta$~RESUME~ = ∆~TPC~ × TPC\_cmd~gap~
  1                             $\Delta$~RESUME~ = $\delta$ ~last~
  ----------------------------- -------------------------------------------

If UE\_DTX\_DRX\_Enabled is TRUE, the UE shall behave as if the ITP mode
is 0.

In the case of a transmission gap in the uplink, TPC\_cmd~gap~ shall be
derived as follows:

\- If DPCH is configured in the downlink then TPC\_cmd~gap~ shall be the
value of TPC\_cmd derived in the first slot of the uplink transmission
gap, if a downlink TPC\_command is transmitted in that slot. Otherwise
TPC\_cmd~gap~ shall be zero if no downlink TPC\_command is transmitted
in that slot.

\- If F-DPCH is configured in the downlink then TPC\_cmd~gap~ shall be
equal to the sum of the values of TPC\_cmd derived from each TPC command
combining period in which a TPC command is known to be present and is
not ignored as described below and which cannot be applied before the
uplink transmission gap. The UE shall ignore any TPC commands received
in an F-DPCH slot starting during an uplink DPCCH slot which is in an
uplink transmission gap. In case there are no TPC commands to be summed
TPC\_cmd~gap~ shall be zero.

δ ~last~ shall be equal to the most recently computed value of δ~i~.
δ~i~ shall be updated according to the following recursive relations,
which shall be executed in all slots in which both the uplink DPCCH and
a downlink TPC command are transmitted, and in the first slot of an
uplink transmission gap if a downlink TPC command is transmitted in that
slot:

$\begin{matrix}
\delta_{i} = 0\text{.}\text{9375}\delta_{i - 1} - 0\text{.}\text{96875}\text{TPC}_{\text{cmd}_{i}}\Delta_{\text{TPC}}k_{\text{sc}} \\
\delta_{i - 1} = \delta_{i} \\
\end{matrix}$

where: TPC\_cmd~i~ is the power control command derived by the UE in
that slot;

*k~sc~* = 0 if additional scaling is applied in the current slot and the
previous slot as described in subclause 5.1.2.6, and *k~sc~* = 1
otherwise.

δ~i-1~ is the value of δ~i~ computed for the previous slot. The value of
δ~i-1~ shall be initialised to zero when the uplink DPCCH is activated,
and also at the end of the first slot after each uplink transmission
gap, and also at the end of the first slot after each downlink
transmission gap. The value of δ~i~ shall be set to zero at the end of
the first slot after each uplink transmission gap.

After a transmission gap in either the uplink or the downlink, the
period following resumption of simultaneous uplink and downlink DPCCH or
F-DPCH transmission is called a recovery period. RPL is the recovery
period length and is expressed as a number of slots. RPL is equal to the
minimum value out of the transmission gap length and 7 slots. If a
transmission gap or an Uplink DPCCH burst pattern gap as defined in
subclause 6C.2 is scheduled to start before RPL slots have elapsed, then
the recovery period shall end at the start of the gap, and the value of
RPL shall be reduced accordingly.

During the recovery period, 2 modes are possible for the power control
algorithm. The Recovery Period Power control mode (RPP) is signalled
with the other compressed mode parameters (see \[4\]). The different
modes are summarised in the table 2:

Table 2: Recovery Period Power control modes during compressed mode

  ------------------------------------ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Recovery Period power control mode   Description
  0                                    Transmit power control is applied using the algorithm determined by the value of PCA, as in subclause 5.1.2.2 with step size ∆~TPC.~
  1                                    Transmit power control is applied using algorithm 1 (see subclause 5.1.2.2.2) with step size ∆~RP-TPC~ during RPL slots after each transmission gap.
  ------------------------------------ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If UE\_DTX\_DRX\_Enabled is TRUE or if PCA has the value 3, the UE shall
behave as if the RPP mode is 0.

For RPP mode 0, the step size is not changed during the recovery period
and ordinary transmit power control is applied (see subclause 5.1.2.2),
using the algorithm for processing TPC commands determined by the value
of PCA (see sub clauses 5.1.2.2.2, 5.1.2.2.3 and 5.1.2.2.4).

For RPP mode 1, during RPL slots after each transmission gap, power
control algorithm 1 is applied with a step size ∆~RP-TPC~ instead of
∆~TPC~, regardless of the value of PCA. Therefore, the change in uplink
DPCCH transmit power at the start of each of the RPL+1 slots immediately
following the transmission gap (except for the first slot after the
transmission gap) is given by:

∆~DPCCH~ = ∆~RP-TPC~ × TPC\_cmd + $\Delta$~PILOT~

∆~RP-TPC~ is called the recovery power control step size and is
expressed in dB. If PCA has the value 1, ∆~RP-TPC~ is equal to the
minimum value of 3 dB and 2∆~TPC~. If PCA has the value 2 , ∆~RP-TPC~ is
equal to 1 dB.

After the recovery period, ordinary transmit power control resumes using
the algorithm specified by the value of PCA and with step size ∆~TPC~.

If PCA has the value 2 , the sets of slots over which the TPC commands
are processed shall remain aligned to the frame boundaries in the
compressed frame. For both RPP mode 0 and RPP mode 1, if the
transmission gap or the recovery period results in any incomplete sets
of TPC commands, TPC\_cmd shall be zero for those sets of slots which
are incomplete.

#### 5.1.2.3A Transmit power control in compressed mode for DPCCH2

In compressed mode, one or more transmission gap pattern sequences are
active. Therefore some frames are compressed and contain transmission
gaps. The uplink power control procedure is as specified in subclause
5.1.2.2A, using the Algorithm 1 as described in subclause 5.1.2.2.2 and
step size (∆~TPC~), but with additional features after each transmission
gap.

Due to the transmission gaps in compressed frames, there may be missing
TPC commands in the downlink. If no downlink TPC command is transmitted,
the corresponding TPC\_cmd derived by the UE shall be set to zero.

At the start of the first slot after an uplink or downlink transmission
gap the UE shall apply a change in the transmit power of the uplink
DPCCH2 by an amount ∆~DPCCH2~ (in dB), with respect to the uplink DPCCH2
power in the most recently transmitted uplink slot, where:

∆~DPCCH2~ = ∆~RESUME2~

The value of ∆~RESUME2~ (in dB) shall be determined by the UE according
to the Initial Transmit Power mode (ITP) as described in 5.1.2.3.

During the recovery period which is described in subclause 5.1.2.3, two
modes are possible for the power control algorithm.

For RPP mode 0, during RPL slots after each transmission gap, power
control algorithm 1 is applied with a step size ∆~TPC~ (see subclause
5.1.2.2A).

For RPP mode 1, during RPL slots after each transmission gap, power
control algorithm 1 is applied with a step size ∆~RP-TPC~ instead of
∆~TPC~. Therefore, the change in uplink DPCCH2 transmit power at the
start of each of the RPL+1 slots immediately following the transmission
gap (except for the first slot after the transmission gap) is given by:

∆~DPCCH2~ = ∆~RP-TPC~ × TPC\_cmd

∆~RP-TPC~ is called the recovery power control step size and is
expressed in dB. ∆~RP-TPC~ is equal to 2∆~TPC~.

After the recovery period, transmit power control for DPCCH2 resumes
using algorithm 1 and with step size ∆~TPC~ (see subclause 5.1.2.2A).

#### 5.1.2.4 Transmit power control in the uplink DPCCH power control preamble

An uplink DPCCH power control preamble is a period of uplink DPCCH
transmission prior to the start of the uplink DPDCH transmission. The
downlink DPCCH or F-DPCH shall also be transmitted during an uplink
DPCCH power control preamble.

The length of the uplink DPCCH power control preamble is a higher layer
parameter signalled by the network as defined in \[5\]. The uplink DPDCH
transmission shall commence after the end of the uplink DPCCH power
control preamble.

During the uplink DPCCH power control preamble the change in uplink
DPCCH transmit power shall be given by:

∆~DPCCH~ = ∆~TPC~ × TPC\_cmd.

During the uplink DPCCH power control preamble TPC\_cmd is derived
according to algorithm 1 as described in sub clause 5.1.2.2.1, if the
value of PCA is 1 or 2. If the value of PCA is 3, TPC\_cmd is derived
according to algorithm 3 as described in sub clause 5.1.2.2.4.

Ordinary power control (see subclause 5.1.2.2), with the power control
algorithm determined by the value of PCA and step size ∆~TPC,~ shall be
used after the end of the uplink DPCCH power control preamble.

#### 5.1.2.5 Setting of the uplink DPCCH/DPDCH relative powers

##### 5.1.2.5.1 General

The uplink DPCCH and DPDCH(s) are transmitted on different codes as
defined in subclause 4.2.1 of \[3\]. In the case that at least one DPDCH
is configured, the gain factors β~c~ and β~d~ may vary for each TFC.
When UL DPCH\_10ms\_Mode is configured by higher layers for a given TFC,
alternative β~c,~ and β~d~ values determine the gain factors for DPDCH
and DPCCH. There are two ways of controlling the gain factors of the
DPCCH code and the DPDCH codes for different TFCs in normal
(non-compressed) frames:

− *β~c~* and *β~d~* are signalled for the TFC, or

− *β~c~* and *β~d~* is computed for the TFC, based on the signalled
settings for a reference TFC.

Combinations of the two above methods may be used to associate *β~c~*
and *β~d~* values to all TFCs in the TFCS. The two methods are described
in subclauses 5.1.2.5.2 and 5.1.2.5.3 respectively. Several reference
TFCs may be signalled from higher layers.

The gain factors may vary on radio frame basis depending on the current
TFC used. Further, the setting of gain factors is independent of the
inner loop power control.

After applying the gain factors, the UE shall scale the total transmit
power of the DPCCH and DPDCH(s), such that the DPCCH output power
follows the changes required by the power control procedure with power
adjustments of ∆~DPCCH~ dB, subject to the provisions of subclause
5.1.2.6.

The gain factors during compressed frames are based on the nominal power
relation defined in normal frames, as specified in subclause 5.1.2.5.4.

##### 5.1.2.5.2 Signalled gain factors

When the gain factors *β~c~* and *β~d~* are signalled by higher layers
for a certain TFC, the signalled values are used directly for weighting
of DPCCH and DPDCH(s). The variable *A~j~*, called the nominal power
relation is then computed as:

$A_{j} = \frac{\beta_{d}}{\beta_{c}}$.

##### 5.1.2.5.3 Computed gain factors

The gain factors *β~c~* and *β~d~* may also be computed for certain
TFCs, based on the signalled settings for a reference TFC.

Let *β~c,ref~* and *β~d,ref~* denote the signalled gain factors for the
reference TFC. Further, let *β~c,j~* and *β~d,j~* denote the gain
factors used for the *j*:th TFC. Also let *L~ref~* denote the number of
DPDCHs used for the reference TFC and *L~,j~* denote the number of
DPDCHs used for the *j*:th TFC.

[Define the variable]{.underline}

$K_{\text{ref}} = \sum_{i}^{}{\text{RM}_{i} \cdot N_{i}}$;

where *RM*~i~ is the semi-static rate matching attribute for transport
channel *i* (defined in \[2\] subclause 4.2.7), *N~i~* is the number of
bits output from the radio frame segmentation block for transport
channel *i* (defined in \[2\] subclause 4.2.6.1), and the sum is taken
over all the transport channels *i* in the reference TFC.

[Similarly, define the variable]{.underline}

$K_{j} = \sum_{i}^{}{\text{RM}_{i} \cdot N_{i}}$;

where the sum is taken over all the transport channels *i* in the *j*:th
TFC.

The variable *A~j~*, called the nominal power relation is then computed
as:

$A_{j} = \frac{\beta_{d,\text{ref}}}{\beta_{c,\text{ref}}} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{L_{\text{ref}}}{L_{j}}}\sqrt{\frac{K_{j}}{K_{\text{ref}}}}$.

The gain factors for the *j*:th TFC are then computed as follows:

\- If *A~j~* \> 1, then $\beta_{d,j} = 1\text{.}0$ and$\beta_{c,j}$ is
the largest quantized$\beta$-value, for which the condition
$\beta_{c,j}$≤ 1 / *A~j~* holds. Since $\beta_{c,j}$ may not be set to
zero, if the above rounding results in a zero value, $\beta_{c,j}$ shall
be set to the lowest quantized amplitude ratio of 1/15 as specified in
\[3\].

\- If *A~j~* ≤ 1, then $\beta_{d,j}$ is the smallest
quantized$\beta$-value, for which the condition $\beta_{d,j}$≥ *A~j~*
holds and $\beta_{c,j} = 1\text{.}0$.

The quantized β-values are defined in \[3\] subclause 4.2.1, table 1.

##### 5.1.2.5.4 Setting of the uplink DPCCH/DPDCH relative powers in compressed mode

When UL\_DPCH\_10ms\_Mode is configured, the gain factors used during a
compressed mode frame are the same as those used in a normal frame. For
all other cases, the following procedure calculates the gain factors to
be used in compressed mode frames.

The gain factors used during a compressed frame for a certain TFC are
calculated from the nominal power relation used in normal
(non-compressed) frames for that TFC. Let *A~j~* denote the nominal
power relation for the *j*:th TFC in a normal frame. Further, let
*β~c,C,j~* and *β~d,C,j~* denote the gain factors used for the *j*:th
TFC when the frame is compressed. The variable *A~C,j~* is computed as:

$A_{C,j} = A_{j} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{\text{15} \cdot N_{\text{pilot},C}}{N_{\text{slots},C} \cdot N_{\text{pilot},N}}}$;

where *N~pilot,C~* is the number of pilot bits per slot when in
compressed mode, and *N~pilot,N~* is the number of pilot bits per slot
in normal mode. *N~slots,C~* is the number of slots in the compressed
frame used for transmitting the data.

The gain factors for the *j*:th TFC in a compressed frame are computed
as follows:

If *A~C,j~* \> 1, then $\beta_{d,C,j} = 1\text{.}0$ and $\beta_{c,C,j}$
is the largest quantized$\beta$-value, for which the condition
$\beta_{c,C,j}$≤ 1 / *A~C,j~* holds. Since $\beta_{c,C,j}$ may not be
set to zero, if the above rounding results in a zero value,
$\beta_{c,C,j}$ shall be set to the lowest quantized amplitude ratio of
1/15 as specified in \[3\].

If *A~C,j~* ≤ 1, then $\beta_{d,C,j}$ is the smallest
quantized$\beta$-value, for which the condition $\beta_{d,C,j}$≥
*A~C,j~* holds and $\beta_{c,C,j} = 1\text{.}0$.

The quantized β-values are defined in \[3\] subclause 4.2.1, table 1.

#### 5.1.2.5A Setting of the uplink HS-DPCCH power relative to DPCCH or DPCCH2 power

When one or two HS-DPCCH are active, the values for ∆~ACK~, ∆~NACK~ and
∆~CQI~ set by higher layers are translated to the quantized amplitude
ratios *A~hs~* as specified in \[3\] subclause 4.2.1.2, and shall be set
for each HS-DPCCH slot as follows.

When only one activated cell's HARQ-ACK information is mapped to a
HS-DPCCH, for each HS-DPCCH and each slot carrying HARQ Acknowledgement,
the HS-DPCCH power settings are described in Table 2a. When more than
one activated cell whose HARQ-ACK information are mapped to a specific
HS-DPCCH, the HS-DPCCH power settings are described in Table 2b. When
the UE is configured in Multiflow mode, the HARQ-ACK slot power settings
of the HS-DPCCH are described in table 2b.1.

Table 2a: HARQ-ACK power offset setting when Secondary\_Cell\_Active is
0 or when Secondary\_Cell\_Enabled is more than 3 in case UE is not
configured in MIMO mode with four transmit antennas in any cell, is more
than 1 in case the UE is configured in MIMO mode with four transmit
antennas in at least one cell and only HARQ-ACK information of one
active downlink cell is mapped to either HS-DPCCH or HS-DPCCH~2~

**When DPCCH2 is not configured the following applies:**

In non-compressed frames *β~hs~*, which is the gain factor defined in
\[3\] subclause 4.2.1.2, is calculated according to

$\beta_{\text{hs}} = \beta_{c} \cdot A_{\text{hs}}$,

where *β~c\ ~*value is signalled by higher-layer or calculated as
described in subclause 5.1.2.5.2 or 5.1.2.5.3 if at least one DPDCH is
configured. In case no DPDCH is configured, *β~c\ ~*value is set as
described in subclause 5.1.2.5C.

With the exception of the start and end of compressed frames, any DPCCH
power change shall not modify the power ratio between the DPCCH and the
HS-DPCCH. The power ratio between the DPCCH and the HS-DPCCH during
compressed DPCCH frames is described below.

During the period between the start and end of a compressed DPCCH frame,
when HS-DPCCH is transmitted, *β~hs~* is calculated according to

$\beta_{\text{hs}} = \beta_{c,C,j} \cdot A_{\text{hs}} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{N_{\text{pilot},C}}{N_{\text{pilot},N}}}$,

where $\beta_{c,C,j}$ is calculated as described in subclause 5.1.2.5.4
if at least one DPDCH is configured. In case no DPDCH is configured,
*β~c,C,j\ ~*value is set as described in subclause 5.1.2.5C.
*N~pilot,C~* is the number of pilot bits per slot on the DPCCH in
compressed frames, and *N~pilot,N~* is the number of pilot bits per slot
in non-compressed frames.

Thus the gain factor *β~hs~* varies depending on the current quantized
amplitude ratio A~hs~ and on whether the UL DPCCH is currently in a
compressed frame.

**When DPCCH2 is configured the following applies:**

In both non-compressed and compressed frames *β~hs~*, which is the gain
factor defined in \[3\] subclause 4.2.1.2, is calculated according to

,

where *β~c2\ ~*value is the gain factor of DPCCH2 defined in \[3\]
subclause 4.2.1.7.

#### 5.1.2.5B Setting of the uplink E-DPCCH and E-DPDCH powers relative to DPCCH power

##### 5.1.2.5B.1 E-DPCCH/DPCCH when one transport block is transmitted on E-DCH

The E-DPCCH gain factor computation depends on the transmitted E-TFC at
a given TTI.

In non compressed frames, if E-TFCI*~i~* is smaller than or equal to
*E-TFCI~ec,boost~* , where *E-TFCI~i~* denotes the E-TFCI of the *i*:th
E-TFC, the E-DPCCH gain factor, *β~ec~*, which is defined in \[3\]
subclause 4.2.1.3, is calculated according to

$\beta_{\text{ec}} = \beta_{c} \cdot A_{\text{ec}}$

where *β~c~* value is signalled by higher-layers or calculated as
described in subclause 5.1.2.5.2 or 5.1.2.5.3 if at least one DPDCH is
configured. In case no DPDCH is configured, *β~c\ ~*value is set as
described in subclause 5.1.2.5C. *A~ec~*  is defined in \[3\] subclause
4.2.1.3. The *E-TFCI~ec,boost\ ~*value is signalled by higher layers.

In non compressed frames if *E-TFCI~i~* is greater than
*E-TFCI~ec,boost~*, the unquantized E-DPCCH gain factor for the *i*:th
E-TFC, *β~ec,i,uq~*~,,~ is calculated according to

$\beta_{\text{ec},i,\text{uq}} = \beta_{c} \cdot \sqrt{\text{max}\left( A_{\text{ec}}^{2},\frac{\sum_{k = 1}^{k_{\text{max,}i}}\left( \frac{\beta_{\text{ed},i,k}}{\beta_{c}} \right)^{2}}{\text{10}^{\frac{{}^{\Delta_{T2\text{TP}}}}{\text{10}}}} - 1 \right)}$

where ∆*~T2TP~* is signalled by higher layers and is defined in \[3\]
subclause 4.2.1.3,$\beta_{\text{ed},i,k}$ is the E-DPDCH gain factor for
the *i*:th E-TFC on the *k*:th physical channel and *k~max,i~* is the
number of physical channels used for the *i*:th E-TFC.

If *β~ec,i,uq~* is less than the smallest quantized value of Table 1B.0A
in \[3\] subclause 4.2.1.3, then the E-DPCCH gain factor of *E-TFCI~i~*,
*β~ec,i\ ~* is set such that *β~ec,i~*/*β~c~* is the smallest quantized
value of Table 1B.0A in \[3\] subclause 4.2.1.3. Otherwise, *β~ec,i~* is
selected from Table 1B.0A in \[3\] subclause 4.2.1.3, such that
20\*log10(*β~ec,i~*/*β~c~*) is the nearest quantized value to
20\*log10(*β~ec,i,uq~*/*β~c~*).

During compressed frames where the E-DCH TTI is 2msec, the E-DPCCH gain
factor, *β~ec~*, which is defined in \[3\] subclause 4.2.1.3, is
calculated according to:

$\beta_{\text{ec}} = \beta_{c,C,j} \cdot A_{\text{ec}} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{N_{\text{pilot},C}}{N_{\text{pilot},N}}}$
if *E-TFCI~i~* is smaller than or equal to *E-TFCI~ec,boost.~*

*and according to*

$\beta_{\text{ec},i,\text{uq}} = \beta_{c,C,j} \cdot \sqrt{\text{max}\left( A_{\text{ec}}^{2},\frac{\sum_{k = 1}^{k_{\text{max,}i}}\left( \frac{\beta_{\text{ed},i,k}}{\beta_{c}} \right)^{2}}{\text{10}^{\frac{{}^{\Delta_{T2\text{TP}}}}{\text{10}}}} - 1 \right)} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{N_{\text{pilot},C}}{N_{\text{pilot},N}}}$ if
*E-TFCI~i~* is greater than *E‑TFCI~ec,boost.~*

where $\beta_{c,C,j}$ is calculated as described in subclause 5.1.2.5.4
if at least one DPDCH is configured. In case no DPDCH is configured, the
$\beta_{c,C,j}$ value is set as described in subclause 5.1.2.5C.
$\beta_{\text{ed},i,k}$ is the E-DPDCH gain factor for the *i*:th E-TFC
on the *k*:th physical channel in non-compressed frames. *N~pilot,C~* is
the number of pilot bits per slot on the DPCCH in compressed frames, and
*N~pilot,N~* is the number of pilot bits per slot in non-compressed
frames. *N~slots,C~* is the number of non DTX slots in the compressed
frame.

During compressed frames and where the E-DCH TTI is 10msec, the E-DPCCH
gain factor, *β~ec~*, which is defined in \[3\] subclause 4.2.1.3, is
calculated according to:

$\beta_{\text{ec}} = \beta_{c,C,j} \cdot A_{\text{ec}} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{\text{15} \cdot N_{\text{pilot},C}}{N_{\text{slots},C} \cdot N_{\text{pilot},N}}}$

When UL\_MIMO\_Enabled is TRUE, and the UE is transmitting two transport

The E-DPDCH gain factor, *β~ed~*, which is defined in \[3\] subclause
4.2.1.3, may take a different value for each E-TFC and HARQ offset. The
gain factors for different E-TFCs and HARQ offsets are computed as
described in subclause 5.1.2.5B.2.3 based on reference gain factor(s)
*β~ed,ref~* of E-TFC(s) signalled as reference E-TFC(s). The *β~ed,ref~
are* computed as described in subclause 5.1.2.5B.2.2. At least one E-TFC
of the set of E-TFCs configured by the network shall be signalled as a
reference E-TFC.

The gain factors may vary on radio frame basis or sub-frame basis
depending on the E-DCH TTI used. Further, the setting of gain factors is
independent of the inner loop power control.

For each reference E-TFC, a reference gain factor *β~ed,ref~* is
calculated according to

where *β~c~* value is signalled by higher-layer or calculated as
described in subclause 5.1.2.5.2 or 5.1.2.5.3 if at least one DPDCH is

Whether E-DPDCH power extrapolation formula or E-DPDCH power
interpolation formula is used to compute the gain factor *β*~ed~ is
signalled by higher layers.

Let *E-TFCI~i~* denote the E-TFCI of the *i*:th E-TFC.

For the *i*:th E-TFC:

If E-DPDCH power extrapolation formula is configured

if *E-TFCI~i~* ≥ *E-TFCI~ref,M~*, the reference E-TFC is the *M*:th

E-TFC is the *m*:th reference E-TFC such that *E‑TFCI~ref,m~* ≤
*E-TFCI~i~* \< *E-TFCI~ref,m+~*~1~.

Else If E-DPDCH power interpolation formula is configured

reference E-TFC and *K~e,i~* denote the transport block size of the
*i*:th E-TFC, where the mapping between the E-TFCI and the E-DCH
transport block size is defined in \[9\]. For the *i*:th E-TFC, the
temporary variable *β~ed,i,harq~* is then computed as:

where the HARQ offset ∆~harq~ is defined in \[3\] subclause 4.2.1.3.

When E-DPDCH power interpolation formula is configured, let *β~ed,ref,1~
and β~ed,ref~*~,2~ denote the reference gain factors of the primary and
secondary reference E-TFCs respectively. Let *L~e,ref,1~* and

secondary reference E-TFCs respectively. Let *L~e,i~* denotes the number
of E-DPDCHs used for the *i*:th E-TFC. If SF2 is used, *L~e,ref,1~* ,
*L~e,ref,2~* and *L~e,i~* are the equivalent number of physical channels
assuming SF4. Let *K~e,ref,1~* and *K~e,ref~,~2~* denote the transport

Let *K~e,i~* denotes the transport block size of the *i*:th E-TFC, where
the mapping between the E-TFCI and the E-DCH transport block size is
defined in \[9\]. For the *i*:th E-TFC, the temporary variable
*β~ed,i,harq~* is computed as:

$\beta_{\text{ed},i,\text{harq}} = \sqrt{\frac{L_{e,\text{ref},1}}{L_{e,i}}} \cdot \sqrt{\left( \left( \frac{\frac{L_{e,\text{ref},2}}{L_{e,\text{ref},1}}\beta_{\text{ed},\text{ref},2}^{2} - \beta_{\text{ed},\text{ref},1}^{2}}{K_{e,\text{ref},2} - K_{e,\text{ref},1}} \right)\left( K_{e,i} - K_{e,\text{ref},1} \right) + \beta_{\text{ed},\text{ref},1}^{2} \right)} \cdot \text{10}^{\left( \frac{\Delta\text{harq}}{\text{20}} \right)}$with
the exception that *β~ed,i,harq\ ~*is set to 0 if
$\left( \frac{\frac{L_{e,\text{ref},2}}{L_{e,\text{ref},1}}\beta_{\text{ed},\text{ref},2}^{2} - \beta_{\text{ed},\text{ref},1}^{2}}{K_{e,\text{ref},2} - K_{e,\text{ref},1}} \right)\left( K_{e,i} - K_{e,\text{ref},1} \right) + \beta_{\text{ed},\text{ref},1}^{2} \leq 0$.

For the *i*:th E-TFC, the unquantized gain factor *β~ed,k,i,uq~* for the
*k*:th E-DPDCH (denoted E‑DPDCH~k~ in \[3\] subclause 4.2.1.3) shall be
set to $\sqrt{2} \times \beta_{\text{ed},i,\text{harq}}$ if the
spreading factor for E-DPDCH~k~ is 2 and to

\- If *β~ed,k,i,uq~*/*β~c~* is less than the smallest quantized value of
Table 1B.2 in \[3\] subclause 4.2.1.3, then the gain factor of
E-DPDCH~k~, *β~ed,k~* is set such that *β~ed,k~*/*β~c~* is the smallest
quantized value of Table 1B.2 in \[3\] subclause 4.2.1.3.

\- Otherwise, *β~ed,k~* is set such that *β~ed,k~*/*β~c~* is the largest

The gain factor applied to E-DPDCH is adjusted as a result of compressed
mode operation in the following cases:

\- E-DCH transmissions that overlap a compressed frame

\- For 10msec E-DCH TTI case, retransmissions that do not themselves
overlap a compressed frame, but for which the corresponding initial
transmission overlapped a compressed frame.

The gain factors used during a compressed frame for a certain E-TFC are
calculated from the nominal power relation used in normal
(non-compressed) frames for that E-TFC. When the frame is compressed,
the gain factor used for the *i*:th E-TFC is derived from *β~ed,C,i~* as
described below.

When the E-DCH TTI is 2msec, *β~ed,C,i~* shall be calculated as follows:

If E-DPDCH power extrapolation formula is configured,

$\beta_{\text{ed},C,i} = \beta_{c,C,j} \cdot A_{\text{ed}} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{L_{e,\text{ref}}}{L_{e,i}}} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{K_{e,i}}{K_{e,\text{ref}}} \cdot \text{10}^{\left( \frac{\Delta_{\text{harq}}}{\text{20}} \right)} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{N_{\text{pilot},C}}{N_{\text{pilot},N}}}}$,

where $\beta_{c,C,j}$ is calculated for the *j*:th TFC as described in
subclause 5.1.2.5.4 if at least one DPDCH is configured. In case no
DPDCH is configured, the $\beta_{c,C,j}$ value is set as described in
subclause 5.1.2.5C. *A~ed~* *, A~ed,1\ ~*and *A~ed,2\ ~*are as defined
in \[3\] subclause 4.2.1.3. *A~ed,1\ ~*and *A~ed,2\ ~*denote the
quantized amplitude ratios assigned to the primary and secondary
reference E-TFCs respectively*.*

number of pilot bits per slot on the DPCCH in compressed frames, and
*N~pilot,N~* is the number of pilot bits per slot in non-compressed
frames.

When the E-DCH TTI is 10msec and the current frame is compressed,
*β~ed,C,i~* shall be calculated as follows:

If E-DPDCH power extrapolation formula is configured

$\beta_{\text{ed},C,i} = \beta_{c,C,j} \cdot A_{\text{ed}} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{L_{e,\text{ref}}}{L_{e,I,i}}} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{K_{e,i}}{K_{e,\text{ref}}} \cdot \text{10}^{\left( \frac{\Delta_{\text{harq}}}{\text{20}} \right)} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{\text{15} \cdot N_{\text{pilot},C}}{N_{\text{slots},I}N_{\text{pilot},N}}}}$,

largest quantized value of Table 1B.2 in \[3\] subclause 4.2.1.3, for
which the condition *β~ed,k~* ≤ *β~ed,\ k,i,uq~* holds.

#### 5.1.2.5D Setting of the uplink S-DPCCH power relative to DPCCH power

##### 5.1.2.5D.1 Setting of the uplink S-DPCCH/DPCCH power ratio when less than two transport blocks are transmitted on E-DCH

If UL\_CLTD\_Enabled is set to TRUE and UL\_CLTD\_Active is 1, or if
UL\_MIMO\_Enabled is set to TRUE and UL\_CLTD\_Active is 1 and the UE is
transmitting either one or zero transport blocks on E-DCH, the S-DPCCH
gain factor, *β~sc~*, which is defined in \[3\] subclause 4.2.1.4, is
calculated depending on the transmitted E-TFC at a given TTI.

In non compressed frames, if no transmission on E-DCH is taking place,
or if E-DCH transmission is taking place and E-TFCI*~i~* is smaller than
or equal to *E-TFCI~ec,boost~* , where *E-TFCI~i~* denotes the E-TFCI of
the *i*:th E-TFC, *β~sc~* is calculated according to

Where the *β~c~* value is signalled by higher layers or calculated as

the *i*:th E-TFC on the *k*:th physical channel and *k~max,i~* is the
number of physical channels used for the *i*:th E-TFC, and the
quantization of *β~sc,i,uq~* follows the quantization according to the
definition of *β~ec~* quantization in table 1B.0A of \[3\].

If *β~sc,i,uq~* is less than the smallest quantized value of Table 1B.0A
in \[3\], then the S-DPCCH gain factor of *E-TFCI~i~*, *β~sc,i\ ~* is
set such that *β~sc,i~*/*β~c~* is the smallest quantized value of Table
1B.0A in \[3\]. Otherwise, *β~sc,i~* is selected from that table such
that 20\*log10(*β~sc,i~*/*β~c~*) is the nearest quantized value to

where $\beta_{c,C,j}$ is calculated as described in subclause 5.1.2.5.4
if at least one DPDCH is configured. In case no DPDCH is configured,
*β~c,C,j\ ~*value is set as described in subclause 5.1.2.5C.
*N~pilot,C~* is the number of pilot bits per slot on the DPCCH in
compressed frames, and *N~pilot,N~* is the number of pilot bits per slot

##### 5.1.2.5D.2 Setting of the uplink S-DPCCH/DPCCH power ratio when two transport blocks are transmitted on E-DCH (rank-2)

When two transport blocks are transmitted on uplink E-DCH, the S-DPCCH
gain factor setting, *β~sc~*, is defined in \[3\] subclause 4.2.1.4.2.

#### 5.1.2.5E Setting of the uplink S-E-DPCCH power relative to DPCCH power

When two transport blocks are transmitted on uplink E-DCH, the S-E-DPCCH
gain factor setting, *β~sec~*, is defined in \[3\] subclause 4.2.1.5.
When one or zero transport blocks are transmitted on uplink E-DCH, the
S-E-DPCCH is not transmitted.

#### 5.1.2.5F Setting of the uplink S-E-DPDCH power relative to E-DPDCH power

When two transport blocks are transmitted on uplink E-DCH, the S-E-DPDCH
gain factor setting, *β~sed~*, is defined in \[3\] subclause 4.2.1.6*.*

When only one or zero transport blocks are transmitted on uplink E-DCH,
the S-E-DPDCH is not transmitted.

#### 5.1.2.6 Maximum and minimum power limits

When E-DCH is not configured, in the case that the total UE transmit
power (after applying DPCCH and DPCCH2 power adjustments and gain
factors) would exceed the maximum allowed value, the UE shall apply
additional scaling to the total transmit power so that it is equal to
the maximum allowed power. This additional scaling shall be such that
the power ratio between DPCCH and DPDCH, between DPCCH and HS-DPCCH, or
between DPCCH2 and HS-DPCCH if DPCCH2 is configured, and between DPCCH
and S-DPCCH remains as required by subclause 5.1.2.5, 5.1.2.5A, and
5.1.2.5D. In addition, scaling to the transmit power shall be such that
the power ratio between DPCCH and DPCCH2 remains fixed if DPCCH2 is
configured.

**Single uplink frequency configured for E-DCH**

> When E-DCH is configured on a single frequency or E-DCH is configured
> on multiple frequencies but Secondary\_EDCH\_Cell\_Active is 0,
>
> **Single transport block transmission (no MIMO)**

\- If the total UE transmit power (after applying DPCCH and DPCCH2 power
adjustments and gain factors) would exceed the maximum allowed value,
the UE shall firstly reduce all the E-DPDCH gain factors *β~ed,k~* by an
equal scaling factor to respective values *β~ed,k,reduced~* so that the
total transmit power would be equal to the maximum allowed power.

\- Also if *E-TFCI~i~* is greater than *E-TFCI~ec,boost~*, UE shall
reduce only E-DPDCH gain factors to respective values *β~ed,k,reduced~*
and E-DPCCH is transmitted using original *β~ec~* which is not
recalculated according to the reduced E-DPDCH gain factors**.**

\- After calculating the reduced E-DPDCH gain factors, if *E-TFCI~i~* is
smaller than or equal to *E-TFCI~ec,boost~*, quantization according to
table 1B.2 in \[3\] subclause 4.2.1.3 may be applied, or if *E-TFCI~i~*
is greater than *E-TFCI~ec,boost~*, quantization according to table
1B.2B in \[3\] subclause 4.2.1.3 may be applied, where each
*β~ed,k,reduced~* is quantized such that *β~ed,k~/β~c~* is the largest
quantized value for which the condition *β~ed,k~* ≤ *β~ed,k,reduced~*
holds.

\- In case a DPDCH is transmitted,

\- if any *β~ed,k,reduced~/β~c~* is less than the smallest quantized
value of Table 1B.2 in \[3\] subclause 4.2.1.3, DTX may be used on that
E-DPDCH. If DTX is used on all E-DPDCHs then DTX is also used on
E-DPCCH, else E-DPCCH is still transmitted using *β~ec~*.

\- When the UE is configured with **HS-DPCCH overhead reduction Type
1,** if DTX is used on all the E-DPDCHs and on the E-DPCCH and the total
UE transmit power still exceeds the maximum allowed value, UE shall
reduce HS-DPCCH gain factors *β~hs~* to *β~hs,\ reduced~* in a slot in
which CQI is transmitted so that the total transmit power would be equal
to the maximum allowed power. If this slot contains the start of a CQI
transmission, then CQI value 0 shall be transmitted instead of the
computed CQI report. After calculating the reduced HS-DPCCH gain
factors, quantization according to table 1A in \[3\] subclause 4.2.1.2
may be applied, where *β~hs,\ reduced~* is quantized such that *β~hs~
/β~c~* if DPCCH2 is not configured, or *β~hs~ /β~c2~* if DPCCH2 is
configured, is the largest quantized value for which the condition
*β~hs~* ≤ *β~hs,\ reduced~* holds. If any *β~hs,\ reduced~ /β~c~* when
DPCCH2 is not configured, or any *β~hs,\ reduced~ /β~c2~* when DPCCH2 is
configured, is less than the smallest quantized value of Table 1A in
\[3\] subclause 4.2.1.2, DTX may be used on that CQI field of HS-DPCCH.

\- In case no DPDCH is transmitted and regardless of the applied uplink
modulation, if any *β~ed,k,reduced~/β~c~* is less than
*β~ed,k,reduced,min~* /*β~c~*, that *β~ed,k~* shall be set to
*β~ed,k,min~* such that *β~ed,k,min~/β~c~ *= min (*β~ed,k,reduced,min~*
/*β~c~*, *β~ed,k,original~/β~c~*), where *β~ed,k,original~* denotes the
E-DPDCH gain factor before reduction.

> **Dual transport block transmission (MIMO)**

\- Also if the UE is transmitting both a set of E-DPDCHs and a set of
S-E-DPDCHs, the UE shall reduce all the E-DPDCH and S-E-DPDCH gain
factors *β~ed,k~* and *β~sed,k~* by an equal scaling factor to
respective values *β~ed,k,reduced~* and *β~sed,k,reduced~* so that the
total transmit power would be equal to the maximum allowed power.

\- After calculating the reduced E-DPDCH and S-E-DPDCH gain factors,
quantization according to table 1B.2B in \[3\] subclause 4.2.1.3 may be
applied, where each *β~ed,k,reduced~* is quantized such that
*β~ed,k~/β~c~* is the largest quantized value for which the condition
*β~ed,k~* ≤ *β~ed,k,reduced~* holds, and *β~sed,k,reduced~* is set to
the same value as the quantized *β~ed,k,reduced~*.

\- if any *β~ed,k,reduced~/β~c~* is less than *β~ed,k,reduced,min~*
/*β~c~*, that *β~ed,k~* shall be set to *β~ed,k,min~* such that
*β~ed,k,min~/β~c~ *= min (*β~ed,k,reduced,min~* /*β~c~*,
*β~ed,k,original~/β~c~*), where *β~ed,k,original~* denotes the E-DPDCH
gain factor before reduction,

\- if any *β~sed,k,reduced~/β~c~* is less than *β~ed,k,reduced,min~*
/*β~c~*, that *β~sed,k~* shall be set to *β~sed,k,min~* such that
*β~sed,k,min~/β~c~ *= min (*β~ed,k,reduced,min~* /*β~c~*,
*β~sed,k,original~/β~c~*), where *β~sed,k,original~* denotes the
S-E-DPDCH gain factor before reduction,

\- *β~ed,k,reduced,min~* is configurable by higher layers.

> **Additional scaling rules applicable to both non-MIMO and MIMO
> transmissions**

\- In the following cases, the UE shall then apply additional scaling to
the total transmit power so that it is equal to the maximum allowed
power:

\- if a DPDCH is transmitted and the total UE transmit power would still
exceed the maximum allowed value even though DTX is used on all E-DPDCHs
and the E-DPCCH, and on the CQI field of HS-DPCCH if the UE is
configured with **HS-DPCCH overhead reduction Type 1**.

\- if no DPDCH is transmitted and the total UE transmit power would
still exceed the maximum allowed value even though *β~ed,k~* is equal to
*β~ed,k,min~ for all k*.

\- Any additional scaling of the total transmit power as described above
shall be such that the power ratio between DPCCH and DPDCH, on the CQI
field between DPCCH and HS-DPCCH (if DTX is not used on CQI field of
HS-DPCCH) or between DPCCH2 and HS-DPCCH (if DTX is not used on CQI
field of HS-DPCCH andDPCCH2 is configured), on HARQ-ACK field between
DPCCH and HS-DPCCH (if HARQ-ACK field is transmitted) or between DPCCH2
and HS-DPCCH (if HARQ-ACK field is transmitted and DPCCH2 is
configured), between DPCCH and E-DPCCH if DTX is not used on E-DPCCH,
and between DPCCH and S-DPCCH, remains as required by subclauses
5.1.2.5, 5.1.2.5A, 5.1.2.5B.1, and 5.1.2.5D, and such that the power
ratio between each E-DPDCH and DPCCH remains as required by
*β~ed,k,min~/β~c~* if DTX is not used on E-DPDCH, and such that the
power ratio between DPCCH and DPCCH2 remains fixed if DPCCH2 is
configured. Any slot-level scaling of *β~ed~* , DTX of E-DPDCH, DTX of
E-DPCCH or DTX of the CQI field of HS-DPCCH as described above is
applied at layer 1 only and is transparent to higher layers.

\- If the UE is transmitting both a set of E-DPDCHs and a set of
S-E-DPDCHs, the UE shall reduce all the E-DPDCH and S-E-DPDCH gain
factors *β~ed,k~* and *β~sed,k~* by an equal scaling factor to
respective values *β~ed,k,reduced~* and *β~sed,k,reduced~* so that the
total transmit power would be equal to the maximum allowed power and the
rule that *β~sed,k,reduced~* is equal to *β~ed,k,reduced~* is always
kept.

**Two uplink frequencies configured for E-DCH**

> When Secondary\_EDCH\_Cell\_Active is 1,

\- If the total UE transmit power (after applying DPCCH and DPCCH2 power
adjustments and gain factors) would exceed the maximum allowed value,
the UE shall start by reducing all the E-DPDCH gain factors *β~ed,k~* on
the frequency with highest DPCCH power by an equal scaling factor to
respective values *β~ed,k,reduced~* so that the total transmit power
would be equal to the maximum allowed power.

\- Also if *E-TFCI~i~* is greater than *E-TFCI~ec,boost~*, UE shall
reduce only E-DPDCH gain factors to respective values *β~ed,k,reduced~*
and E-DPCCH is transmitted using original *β~ec~* which is not
recalculated according to the reduced E-DPDCH gain factors. After
calculating the reduced E-DPDCH gain factors, if *E-TFCI~i~* is smaller
than or equal to *E-TFCI~ec,boost~*, quantization according to table
1B.2 in \[3\] subclause 4.2.1.3 may be applied, or if *E-TFCI~i~* is
greater than *E-TFCI~ec,boost~*, quantization according to table 1B.2B
in \[3\] subclause 4.2.1.3 may be applied, where each *β~ed,k,reduced~*
is quantized such that *β~ed,k~/β~c~* is the largest quantized value for
which the condition *β~ed,k~* ≤ *β~ed,k,reduced~* holds.

\- If *β~ed,k,reduced~/β~c~* is less than *β~ed,k,reduced,min~* /*β~c~*
then *β~ed,k~* shall be set to *β~ed,k,min~* such that
*β~ed,k,min~/β~c~ *= min (*β~ed,k,reduced,min~* /*β~c~*,
*β~ed,k,original~/β~c~*), where *β~ed,k,original~* denotes the E-DPDCH
gain factor before reduction and *β~ed,k,reduced,min~* is individually
configured by higher layers for each frequency.

\- The UE shall then apply the same procedure on the uplink frequency
with second highest DPCCH power.

\- If *β~ed,k,min~/β~c~ *= min (*β~ed,k,reduced,min~* /*β~c~*,
*β~ed,k,original~/β~c~*) for all activated uplink frequencies, then

\- In case a DPDCH is transmitted,

\- if any *β~ed,k,reduced~/β~c~* is less than the smallest quantized
value of Table 1B.2 in \[3\] subclause 4.2.1.3, DTX may be used on that
E-DPDCH on the frequency with highest DPCCH power. If DTX is used on all
E-DPDCHs on the frequency with highest DPCCH power then DTX is also used
on E-DPCCH on the frequency with highest DPCCH power, else E-DPCCH is
still transmitted using *β~ec~*.

\- The UE shall then apply the same procedure on the uplink frequency
with second highest DPCCH power.

\- When the UE is configured with **HS-DPCCH overhead reduction Type
1,** if DTX is used on all the E-DPDCHs and on the E-DPCCH and the total
UE transmit power still exceeds the maximum allowed value, UE shall
reduce HS-DPCCH gain factors *β~hs~* to *β~hs,\ reduced~* in a slot in
which CQI is transmitted so that the total transmit power would be equal
to the maximum allowed power. If this slot contains the start of a CQI
transmission, then CQI value 0 shall be transmitted instead of the
computed CQI report. After calculating the reduced HS-DPCCH gain
factors, quantization according to table 1A in \[3\] subclause 4.2.1.2
may be applied, where *β~hs,\ reduced~* is quantized such that *β~hs~
/β~c~* if DPCCH2 is not configured, or *β~hs~ /β~c2~* if DPCCH2 is
configured, is the largest quantized value for which the condition
*β~hs~* ≤ *β~hs,\ reduced~* holds. If any *β~hs,\ reduced~ /β~c~* when
DPCCH2 is not configured, or any *β~hs,\ reduced~ /β~c2~* when DPCCH2 is
configured, is less than the smallest quantized value of Table 1A in
\[3\] subclause 4.2.1.2, DTX may be used on that CQI field of HS-DPCCH.

\- Any additional scaling of the total transmit power shall be such
that:

\- if the total UE transmit power would still exceed the maximum allowed
value even though DTX is used on all E-DPDCHs and the E-DPCCH, and on
the CQI field of HS-DPCCH if the UE is configured with **HS-DPCCH
overhead reduction Type 1**.

\- Any additional scaling of the total transmit power as described above
shall be such that the power ratio between DPCCH and DPDCH, on the CQI
field between DPCCH and HS-DPCCH (if DTX is not used on CQI field of
HS-DPCCH) or between DPCCH2 and HS-DPCCH (if DTX is not used on CQI
field of HS-DPCCH andDPCCH2 is configured), on HARQ-ACK field between
DPCCH and HS-DPCCH (if HARQ-ACK field is transmitted) or between DPCCH2
and HS-DPCCH (if HARQ-ACK field is transmitted and DPCCH2 is
configured), between DPCCH and E-DPCCH if DTX is not used on E-DPCCH,
and between DPCCH and S-DPCCH, remains as required by subclauses
5.1.2.5, 5.1.2.5A, 5.1.2.5B.1, and 5.1.2.5D, and such that the power
ratio between each E-DPDCH and DPCCH remains as required by
*β~ed,k,min~/β~c~* if DTX is not used on E-DPDCH, and such that the
power ratio between DPCCH and DPCCH2 remains fixed if DPCCH2 is
configured. Any slot-level scaling of *β~ed~* , DTX of E-DPDCH, DTX of
E-DPCCH or DTX of the CQI field of HS-DPCCH as described above is
applied at layer 1 only and is transparent to higher layers.

\- In case no DPDCH is transmitted, any additional scaling of the total
transmit power shall be such that

\- the power ratio between DPCCH and HS-DPCCH or between DPCCH2 and
HS-DPCCH if DPCCH2 is configured, and between DPCCH and E-DPCCH, for
each activated uplink frequency remains as required by subclauses
5.1.2.5, 5.1.2.5A and 5.1.2.5B.1, and such that the power ratio between
each E-DPDCH and DPCCH remains as required by *β~ed,k,min~/β~c~* and

\- the power ratio between DPCCH on the activated frequencies remains
unchanged.

**Additional generic power scaling rules**

Any scaling, and any reduction in the E-DPDCH gain factor as described
above, shall only be applied or changed at a DPCCH slot boundary. In
order that the total UE transmit power does not exceed the maximum
allowed value the scaling or E-DPDCH gain factor reduction shall be
computed using the maximum HS-DPCCH power transmitted in the next DPCCH
slot. In the case that either an ACK or a NACK transmission will start
during the next DPCCH slot, the maximum HS-DPCCH power shall be computed
using one of the following:

a\) whichever of ∆~ACK~ and ∆~NACK~ will be used according to whether
the transmission will be ACK or NACK, *or*

b\) whichever of ∆~ACK~ and ∆~NACK~ is the largest.

When transmitting on a DPCH the UE is not required to be capable of
reducing its total transmit power below the minimum level required in
\[7\]. However, it may do so, provided that the power ratio between
DPCCH and DPDCH, between DPCCH and HS-DPCCH or between DPCCH2 and
HS-DPCCH if DPCCH2 is configured, and between DPCCH and S-DPCCH remains
as specified in sub clause 5.1.2.5, 5.1.2.5A, and 5.1.2.5D. Some further
regulations also apply as follows: In the case that the total UE
transmit power (after applying DPCCH power adjustments and gain factors)
would be at or below the total transmit power in the previously
transmitted slot and also at or below the required minimum power
specified in \[7\], the UE may apply additional scaling to the total
transmit power, subject to the following restrictions:

\- The total transmit power after applying any additional scaling shall
not exceed the required minimum power, nor the total transmit power in
the previously transmitted slot;

\- The magnitude of any reduction in total transmit power between slots
after applying any additional scaling shall not exceed the magnitude of
the calculated power reduction before the additional scaling.

In the case that the total UE transmit power in the previously
transmitted slot is at or below the required minimum power specified in
\[7\] and the DPCCH power adjustment and gain factors for the current
slot would result in an increase in total power, then no additional
scaling shall be used (i.e. power control shall operate as normal).

If the UE applies any additional scaling to the total transmit power as
described above, this scaling shall be included in the computation of
any DPCCH power adjustments to be applied in the next transmitted slot.

### 5.1.3 Void

5.2 Downlink power control
--------------------------

The transmit power of the downlink channels is determined by the
network. In general the ratio of the transmit power between different
downlink channels is not specified and may change with time. However,
regulations exist as described in the following subclauses.

Higher layer power settings shall be interpreted as setting of the total
power, i.e. the sum of the power from the two antennas in case of
transmit diversity.

### 5.2.1 DPCCH/DPDCH/F-DPCH

#### 5.2.1.1 General

The downlink transmit power control procedure controls simultaneously
the power of a DPCCH and its corresponding DPDCHs. The power control
loop adjusts the power of the DPCCH and DPDCHs with the same amount,
i.e. the relative power difference between the DPCCH and DPDCHs is not
changed. In case of F-DPCH, the power control loop adjusts the F-DPCH
power. If DPCCH2 is configured, the power control loop associated with
DPCCH2 adjusts the F-DPCH power at the serving HS-DSCH cell, and the
power control loop associated with DPCCH adjusts the F-DPCH power at the
designated non-serving HS-DSCH cell. If multiple frequencies are
activated in the uplink, then the downlink transmit power control
procedure shall be followed independently for each associated downlink
frequency.

For DPCH, the relative transmit power offset between DPCCH fields and
DPDCHs is determined by the network. The TFCI and pilot fields of the
DPCCH are offset relative to the DPDCHs power by PO1 and PO3 dB
respectively. When DL\_DCH\_FET\_Config is not configured by higher
layers, or, when DL\_DCH\_FET\_Config is configured and no SRBs are
transmitted in the radio frame, the TPC fields of the DPCCH are offset
relative to the DPDCHs power by PO2; otherwise, when
DL\_DCH\_FET\_Config is configured by higher layers, and, SRB is
transmitted in the radio frame, the TPC fields of the DPCCH are offset
relative to the DPDCHs power by PO2 -- PO~SRB~. The power offsets may
vary in time. The method for controlling the power offsets within UTRAN
is specified in \[6\]. The power offsets PO1, PO2, PO3 and PO~SRB~ do
not apply to F-DPCH.

#### 5.2.1.2 Ordinary transmit power control

##### 5.2.1.2.1 UE behaviour

If Algorithm 3 is not configured for the serving radio link, the UE
behaviour is as follows.

If DPCCH2 is not configured, the UE shall generate TPC commands to
control the network transmit power and send them in the TPC field of the
uplink DPCCH. An example on how to derive the TPC commands is given in
Annex B.2.

If DPCCH2 is configured, the UE shall generate TPC commands to control
the network transmit power from the serving HS-DSCH cell and send them
in the TPC field of the uplink DPCCH2, and in addition, if E-DCH
decoupling is not configured, the UE shall generate TPC commands to
control the network transmit power from the designated non-serving
HS-DSCH cell signalled by the network and send them in the TPC field of
the uplink DPCCH.

If E-DCH decoupling is configured, the UE shall generate TPC commands to
control the network transmit power from the serving E-DCH cell and send
them in the TPC field of the uplink DPCCH.

The UE shall check the downlink power control mode (DPC\_MODE) before
generating the TPC command:

\- if DPC\_MODE = 0 : the UE sends a unique TPC command in each slot and
the TPC command generated is transmitted in the first available TPC
field in the uplink DPCCH/DPCCH2. In case uplink DPCCH slot format \#4
is used then UE may delay transmitting generated TPC command to the next
available TPC field

\- if DPC\_MODE = 1 : the UE repeats the same TPC command over 3 slots
and the new TPC command is transmitted such that there is a new command
at the beginning of the frame, unless UE\_DTX\_DRX\_Enabled is TRUE, in
which case the UE shall behave as for DPC\_MODE=0. If DPC\_MODE=1 when
uplink DPCCH slot format \#4 is configured, the UE behaviour is
undefined.

The DPC\_MODE parameter is a UE specific parameter controlled by the
UTRAN.

The UE shall not make any assumptions on how the downlink power is set
by UTRAN, in order to not prohibit usage of other UTRAN power control
algorithms than what is defined in subclause 5.2.1.2.2.

If the serving radio link is configured with Algorithm 3, the UE
generates the TPC commands in the uplink DPCCH as follows:

\- The UE shall generate one uplink TPC command in the slot where the
downlink TPC command is known to be present.

\- If the length of the slot cycle is 3, the uplink TPC commands
generated in the subsequent slots where the downlink TPC command is not
known to be present shall take the value of 0 and 1, respectively.

\- If the length of the slot cycle is 5, the uplink TPC commands
generated in the subsequent slots where the downlink TPC command is not
known to be present shall take the value of 0, 1, 0 and 1, respectively.

##### 5.2.1.2.1.1 F-DPCH quality target control {#f-dpch-quality-target-control .H6}

When DPCCH2 is not configured, the UTRAN sets a quality target for the
F-DPCH. The UE autonomously sets a SIR target value and adjusts it in
order to achieve the same quality as the quality target set by UTRAN.
The quality target is set as a downlink TPC command error rate target
value for the F-DPCH belonging to the radio link from the HS-DSCH
serving cell as signalled by the UTRAN for the case where E-DCH
decoupling is not configured. If E-DCH decoupling is configured, the
quality target is set as a downlink TPC command error rate target value
for the F-DPCH belonging to the radio link from the serving E-DCH cell
as signalled by the UTRAN. The UE shall set the SIR target when the
F-DPCH has been setup or reconfigured. It shall not increase the SIR
target value before the power control has converged on the current
value. The UE may estimate whether the power control has converged on
the current value, by comparing the averaged measured SIR to the SIR
target value. When UL\_DTX\_Active is TRUE, the UE shall ignore in the
SIR target value adjustment any TPC commands received in F-DPCH slot
starting during an uplink DPCCH slot which is in an uplink DPCCH
transmission gap.

When DPCCH2 is configured, the UE monitors two independent F-DPCH
qualities, one for the F-DPCH associated with the uplink DPCCH2
belonging to the HS-DSCH serving cell, and one for F-DPCH belonging to
the designated non-serving HS-DSCH cell. If E-DCH decoupling is
configured, the designated non-serving HS-DSCH cell is the serving E-DCH
cell. The UTRAN sets a single quality target which is set as a downlink
TPC command error rate target value for the F-DPCHs. The UE autonomously
sets a SIR target value and adjusts it in order to achieve the same
quality as the quality target set by UTRAN. It shall not increase the
SIR target value before the power control has converged on the current
value. The UE may estimate whether the power control has converged on
the current value, by comparing the averaged measured SIR to the SIR
target value. When UL\_DTX\_Active is TRUE, the UE shall ignore in the
SIR target value adjustment any TPC commands received in F-DPCH slot
starting during an uplink DPCCH slot which is in an uplink DPCCH
transmission gap.

##### 5.2.1.2.2 UTRAN behaviour

If DPCCH2 is not configured, upon receiving the TPC commands from DPCCH,
UTRAN shall adjust its downlink DPCCH/DPDCH or F-DPCH power accordingly.

If DPCCH2 is configured and DPCH is not configured, upon receiving the
TPC commands from DPCCH2, UTRAN shall adjust its downlink power of
F-DPCH associated with DPCCH2 for the serving HS-DSCH cell accordingly,
and upon receiving the TPC commands from DPCCH, UTRAN shall adjust its
downlink power of F-DPCH associated with DPCCH for the designated
non-serving HS-DSCH cell. For the serving HS-DSCH cell, both the F-DPCH
associated with DPCCH2 and the F-DPCH associated with DPCCH are
transmitted at the same power.

If DPCCH2 is configured and DPCH is configured, upon receiving the TPC
commands from DPCCH2, UTRAN shall adjust its downlink power of F-DPCH
associated with DPCCH2 for the serving HS-DSCH cell accordingly, and
upon receiving the TPC commands from DPCCH, UTRAN shall adjust its
downlink power of DPCCH/DPDCH accordingly.

For DPC\_MODE = 0, and for DPC\_MODE=1 if UE\_DTX\_DRX\_Enabled is
TRUE,UTRAN shall estimate the transmitted TPC command TPC~est~ to be 0
or 1, and shall update the power every transmitted slot. If DPC\_MODE =
1 and UE\_DTX\_DRX\_Enabled is FALSE, UTRAN shall estimate the
transmitted TPC command TPC~est~ over three slots to be 0 or 1, and
shall update the power every three slots.

After estimating the *k*:th TPC command, UTRAN shall adjust the current
downlink power *P*(*k*-1) \[dB\] to a new power *P*(*k*) \[dB\]
according to the following formula:

*P*(*k*) = *P*(*k* - 1) + *P~TPC~*(*k*) + *P~bal~*(*k*),

where *P~TPC~*(*k*) is the *k*:th power adjustment due to the inner loop
power control, and *P~bal~*(*k*) \[dB\] is a correction according to the
downlink power control procedure for balancing radio link powers towards
a common reference power. The power balancing procedure and control of
the procedure is described in \[6\].

*P~TPC~*(*k*) is calculated according to the following.

If the value of *Limited Power Increase Used* parameter is \'Not used\',
then

$P_{\text{TPC}}(k) = \left\{ \begin{matrix}
 + \Delta_{\text{TPC}} & \text{if}\ \text{TPC}_{\text{est}}(k) = 1 \\
 - \Delta_{\text{TPC}} & \text{if}\ \text{TPC}_{\text{est}}(k) = 0 \\
\end{matrix} \right.\ $, \[dB\]. (1)

If the value of *Limited Power Increase Used* parameter is \'Used\',
then the *k:*th inner loop power adjustment shall be calculated as:

$P_{\text{TPC}}(k) = \left\{ \begin{matrix}
\begin{matrix}
 + \Delta_{\text{TPC}} \\
0 \\
 - \Delta_{\text{TPC}} \\
\end{matrix} & \begin{matrix}
\text{if\ TPC}_{\text{est}}(k) = 1\text{\ \ \ and\ \ \ }\Delta_{\text{sum}}(k) + \Delta_{\text{TPC}} < \text{Power\_Raise\_Limit} \\
\text{if\ TPC}_{\text{est}}(k) = 1\text{\ \ \ and\ \ \ }\Delta_{\text{sum}}(k) + \Delta_{\text{TPC}} \geq \text{Power\_Raise\_Limit} \\
\text{if\ TPC}_{\text{est}}(k) = 0 \\
\end{matrix} \\
\end{matrix} \right.\ $, \[dB\] (2)

where

is the temporary sum of the last *DL\_Power\_Averaging\_Window\_Size*
inner loop power adjustments (in dB).

For the first (*DL\_Power\_Averaging\_Window\_Size* -- 1) adjustments
after the activation of the limited power increase method, formula (1)
shall be used instead of formula (2). *Power\_Raise\_Limit* and
*DL\_Power\_Averaging\_Window\_Size* are parameters configured in the
UTRAN.

The power control step size ∆~TPC~ can take four values: 0.5, 1, 1.5 or
2 dB. It is mandatory for UTRAN to support ∆~TPC~ of 1 dB, while support
of other step sizes is optional.

In addition to the above described formulas on how the downlink power is
updated, the restrictions below apply.

In case of congestion (commanded power not available), UTRAN may
disregard the TPC commands from the UE.

The average power of transmitted DPDCH symbols over one timeslot shall
not exceed Maximum\_DL\_Power (dB), nor shall it be below
Minimum\_DL\_Power (dB). Transmitted DPDCH symbol means here a complex
QPSK symbol before spreading which does not contain DTX.
Maximum\_DL\_Power (dB) and Minimum\_DL\_Power (dB) are power limits for
one channelisation code, relative to the primary CPICH power \[6\].

In case of F-DPCH, the power of the transmitted symbol over one timeslot
for a given UE shall not exceed Maximum\_DL\_Power (dB), nor shall it be
below Minimum\_DL\_Power (dB). Transmitted symbol means here a complex
QPSK symbol before spreading which does not contain DTX.

In the case that UL\_DTX\_Active is TRUE (see clause 6C), if no uplink
TPC command is received due to Uplink DPCCH burst pattern gap as defined
in subclause 6C.2.1, *P~TPC~(k)* derived by the Node B shall be set to
zero.

#### 5.2.1.3 Power control in compressed mode

The aim of downlink power control in uplink or/and downlink compressed
mode is to recover as fast as possible a signal-to-interference ratio
(SIR) close to the target SIR after each transmission gap.

The UE behaviour is the same in compressed mode as in normal mode,
described in subclause 5.2.1.2, except that the target SIR for a DPCH is
offset by higher layer signalling. However due to transmission gaps in
uplink compressed frames there may be incomplete sets of TPC commands
when DPC\_MODE=1.

UTRAN behaviour is as stated in subclause 5.2.1.2.2 except for DPC\_MODE
= 1 where missing TPC commands in the UL may lead the UTRAN to changing
its power more frequently than every 3 slots.

In compressed mode, compressed frames may occur in either the uplink or
the downlink or both. In downlink compressed frames, the transmission of
downlink DPDCH(s), DPCCH and F-DPCH shall be stopped during transmission
gaps.

The power of the DPCCH and DPDCH in the first slot after the
transmission gap, or the power of the F-DPCH in the first slot after the
transmission gap, should be set to the same value as in the slot just
before the transmission gap.

During compressed mode except during downlink transmission gaps, UTRAN
shall estimate the *k*:th TPC command and adjust the current downlink
power *P*(*k*-1) \[dB\] to a new power *P*(*k*) \[dB\] according to the
following formula:

*P*(*k*) = *P*(*k* - 1) + *P~TPC~*(*k*) + *P~SIR~(k)* + *P~bal~*(*k*),

where *P~TPC~*(*k*) is the *k*:th power adjustment due to the inner loop
power control, *P~SIR~(k)* is the k-th power adjustment due to the
downlink target SIR variation, and *P~bal~*(*k*) \[dB\] is a correction
according to the downlink power control procedure for balancing radio
link powers towards a common reference power. The power balancing
procedure and control of the procedure is described in \[6\].

Due to transmission gaps in uplink compressed frames, there may be
missing TPC commands in the uplink.

For DPC\_MODE = 0, and for DPC\_MODE=1 if UE\_DTX\_DRX\_Enabled is TRUE,
if no uplink TPC command is received, *P~TPC~(k)* derived by the Node B
shall be set to zero. Otherwise, *P~TPC~*(*k*) is calculated the same
way as in normal mode (see subclause 5.2.1.2.2) but with a step size
∆~STEP~ instead of ∆~TPC~.

For DPC\_MODE = 1 if UE\_DTX\_DRX\_Enabled is FALSE, the sets of slots
over which the TPC commands are processed shall remain aligned to the
frame boundaries in the compressed frame. If this results in an
incomplete set of TPC commands, the UE shall transmit the same TPC
commands in all slots of the incomplete set.

The power control step size ∆~STEP~ = ∆~RP-TPC~ during RPL slots after
each transmission gap and ∆~STEP~ = ∆~TPC~ otherwise, where:

\- RPL is the recovery period length and is expressed as a number of
slots. RPL is equal to the minimum value out of the transmission gap
length and 7 slots. If a transmission gap or an Uplink DPCCH burst
pattern gap as defined in subclause 6C.2 is scheduled to start before
RPL slots have elapsed, then the recovery period shall end at the start
of the gap, and the value of RPL shall be reduced accordingly. 

\- ∆~RP-TPC~ is called the recovery power control step size and is
expressed in dB. ∆~RP-TPC~ is equal to the minimum value of 3 dB and
2∆~TPC~.

For F-DPCH, *P~SIR~*(*k*) = 0.

For DPCH, the power offset *P~SIR~*(*k*) = δP~curr~ - δP~prev~, where
δP~curr~ and δP~prev~ are respectively the value of δP in the current
slot and the most recently transmitted slot and δP is computed as
follows:

δP = max (∆P1\_compression, ..., ∆Pn\_compression) + ∆P1\_coding +
∆P2\_coding

where n is the number of different TTI lengths amongst TTIs of all TrChs
of the CCTrCh, where ∆P1\_coding and ∆P2\_coding are computed from
uplink parameters DeltaSIR1, DeltaSIR2, DeltaSIRafter1, DeltaSIRafter2
signaled by higher layers as:

\- ∆P1\_coding = DeltaSIR1 if the start of the first transmission gap in
the transmission gap pattern is within the current frame and
UE\_DTX\_DRX\_Enabled is FALSE.

\- ∆P1\_coding = DeltaSIRafter1 if the current frame just follows a
frame containing the start of the first transmission gap in the
transmission gap pattern and UE\_DTX\_DRX\_Enabled is FALSE.

\- ∆P2\_coding = DeltaSIR2 if the start of the second transmission gap
in the transmission gap pattern is within the current frame and
UE\_DTX\_DRX\_Enabled is FALSE.

\- ∆P2\_coding = DeltaSIRafter2 if the current frame just follows a
frame containing the start of the second transmission gap in the
transmission gap pattern and UE\_DTX\_DRX\_Enabled is FALSE.

\- ∆P1\_coding = 0 dB and ∆P2\_coding = 0 dB in all other cases.

and ∆Pi\_compression is defined by :

\- ∆Pi\_compression = 3 dB for downlink frames compressed by reducing
the spreading factor by 2.

\- ∆Pi\_compression = 0 dB in all other cases.

In case several compressed mode patterns are used simultaneously, a δP
offset is computed for each compressed mode pattern and the sum of all
δP offsets is applied to the frame.

For all time slots except those in transmissions gaps, the average power
of transmitted DPDCH symbols over one timeslot shall not exceed
Maximum\_DL\_Power (dB) by more than δP~curr~, nor shall it be below
Minimum\_DL\_Power (dB). Transmitted DPDCH symbol means here a complex
QPSK symbol before spreading which does not contain DTX.
Maximum\_DL\_Power (dB) and Minimum\_DL\_Power (dB) are power limits for
one channelisation code, relative to the primary CPICH power \[6\].

For F-DPCH, for all time slots except those in transmissions gaps the
power of the transmitted symbol over one timeslot for a given UE shall
not exceed Maximum\_DL\_Power (dB), nor shall it be below
Minimum\_DL\_Power (dB). Transmitted symbol means here a complex QPSK
symbol before spreading which does not contain DTX.

#### 5.2.1.4 Power scaling of DPDCH with PO~SRB~

When DL\_DCH\_FET\_Config is configured by higher layers, and SRB is
transmitted in the radio frame, the TPC fields of the DPCCH are offset
relative to the DPDCHs power by PO2 -- PO~SRB~. The change in TPC/DPDCH
offset between PO2 and PO2 -- PO~SRB~ happens by adjusting the power of
DPCH (both TPC and DPDCH fields) according to power control rules of
Subclause 5.2.1.2.2 or 5.2.1.3, and then, scaling the DPDCH fields by a
factor of PO~SRB~ (in dB). Figure 1A describes the scaling procedure.

6 Random access procedure
=========================

6.1 Physical random access procedure
------------------------------------

The physical random access procedure described in this subclause is
initiated upon request from the MAC sublayer (cf. \[9\]). This procedure
can also be initiated if indicated by higher layers and
Fallback\_R99\_Enabled is TRUE.

Before the physical random-access procedure can be initiated, Layer 1
shall receive the following information from the higher layers (RRC):

\- The preamble scrambling code.

\- The message length in time, either 10 or 20 ms.

\- The AICH\_Transmission\_Timing parameter \[0 or 1\].

\- The set of available signatures and the set of available RACH
sub-channels for each Access Service Class (ASC). Sub-channels are
defined in subclause 6.1.1.

\- The power-ramping factor Power Ramp Step \[integer \> 0\].

\- The parameter Preamble Retrans Max \[integer \> 0\].

\- The initial preamble power Preamble\_Initial\_Power.

\- The Power offset P p-m = P~message-control~ -- P~preamble~, measured
in dB, between the power of the last transmitted preamble and the
control part of the random-access message.

\- The set of Transport Format parameters. This includes the power
offset between the data part and the control part of the random-access
message for each Transport Format.

Note that the above parameters may be updated from higher layers before
each physical random access procedure is initiated.

At each initiation of the physical random access procedure, Layer 1
shall receive the following information from the higher layers (MAC):

\- The Transport Format to be used for the PRACH message part.

\- The ASC of the PRACH transmission.

\- The data to be transmitted (Transport Block Set).

The physical random-access procedure shall be performed as follows:

1 Derive the available uplink access slots, in the next full access slot
set or in the next 8 access slots, for the set of available RACH
sub-channels within the given ASC with the help of subclauses 6.1.1. and
6.1.2. Randomly select one access slot among the ones previously
determined. If there is no access slot available in the selected set,
randomly select one uplink access slot corresponding to the set of
available RACH sub-channels within the given ASC from the next access
slot set or in the next 7 access slots. The random function shall be
such that each of the allowed selections is chosen with equal
probability.

2 Randomly select a signature from the set of available signatures
within the given ASC. The random function shall be such that each of the
allowed selections is chosen with equal probability.

3 Set the Preamble Retransmission Counter to Preamble Retrans Max.

4 If the Preamble\_Initial\_Power is below the minimum level required in
\[7\], set the Commanded Preamble Power to a value, which shall be at or
above the Preamble\_Initial\_Power and at or below the required minimum
power specified in \[7\]. Otherwise set the parameter Commanded Preamble
Power to Preamble\_Initial\_Power.

5 In the case that the Commanded Preamble Power exceeds the maximum
allowed value, set the preamble transmission power to the maximum
allowed power. In the case that the Commanded Preamble Power is below
the minimum level required in \[7\], set the preamble transmission power
to a value, which shall be at or above the Commanded Preamble Power and
at or below the required minimum power specified in \[7\]. Otherwise set
the preamble transmission power to the Commanded Preamble Power.
Transmit a preamble using the selected uplink access slot, signature,
and preamble transmission power.

6 If no positive or negative acquisition indicator (AI ≠ +1 nor --1)
corresponding to the selected signature is detected in the downlink
access slot corresponding to the selected uplink access slot:

6.1 Select the next available access slot in the set of available RACH
sub-channels within the given ASC.

6.2 Randomly select a new signature from the set of available signatures
within the given ASC. The random function shall be such that each of the
allowed selections is chosen with equal probability.

6.3 Increase the Commanded Preamble Power by ∆P~0~ = Power Ramp Step
\[dB\]. If the Commanded Preamble Power exceeds the maximum allowed
power by 6dB, the UE may pass L1 status (\"No ack on AICH\") to the
higher layers (MAC) and exit the physical random access procedure.

6.4 Decrease the Preamble Retransmission Counter by one.

6.5 If the Preamble Retransmission Counter \> 0 then repeat from step 5.
Otherwise pass L1 status (\"No ack on AICH\") to the higher layers (MAC)
and exit the physical random access procedure.

7 If a negative acquisition indicator corresponding to the selected
signature is detected in the downlink access slot corresponding to the
selected uplink access slot, pass L1 status (\"Nack on AICH received\")
to the higher layers (MAC) and exit the physical random access
procedure.

8 Transmit the random access message three or four uplink access slots
after the uplink access slot of the last transmitted preamble depending
on the AICH transmission timing parameter. Transmission power of the
control part of the random access message should be P p-m  \[dB\] higher
than the power of the last transmitted preamble. Transmission power of
the data part of the random access message is set according to subclause
5.1.1.2.

9 Pass L1 status \"RACH message transmitted\" to the higher layers and
exit the physical random access procedure.

### 6.1.1 RACH sub-channels

A RACH sub-channel defines a sub-set of the total set of uplink access
slots. There are a total of 12 RACH sub-channels. RACH sub-channel \#i
(i = 0, ..., 11) consists of the following uplink access slots:

\- Uplink access slot \#i leading by τ~p-a~ chips the downlink access
slot \#i contained within the 10 ms interval that is time aligned with
P-CCPCH frames for which SFN mod 8 = 0 or SFN mod 8 = 1.

\- Every 12^th^ access slot relative to this access slot.

The access slots of different RACH sub-channels are also illustrated in
Table 7.

### 6.1.2 RACH access slot sets

The PRACH contains two sets of access slots as shown in Figure 2. Access
slot set 1 contains PRACH slots 0 -- 7 and starts τ~p-a~ chips before
the downlink P-CCPCH frame for which SFN mod 2 = 0. Access slot set 2
contains PRACH slots 8 - 14 and starts (τ~p-a~ --2560) chips before the
downlink P-CCPCH frame for which SFN mod 2 = 1.

6.1A Physical random access procedure for Enhanced Uplink in CELL\_FACH state and IDLE mode {#a-physical-random-access-procedure-for-enhanced-uplink-in-cell_fach-state-and-idle-mode .list-paragraph}
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The physical random access procedure described in this subclause is
initiated upon request from the MAC sublayer (cf. \[9\]).

Before the physical random-access procedure can be initiated, Layer 1
shall receive the following information from the higher layers (RRC):

\- Preamble scrambling code(s) for 2 and 10ms TTI.

\- The AICH\_Transmission\_Timing parameter \[0 or 1\].

\- The set of available signatures and the set of available RACH
sub-channels corresponding to E-DCH resources for each Access Service
Class (ASC). Sub-channels are defined in subclause 6.1.1.

\- The total number of E-DCH resources configured in the cell.

\- The power-ramping factor Power Ramp Step \[integer \> 0\].

\- The parameter Preamble Retrans Max \[integer \> 0\].

\- The initial preamble power Preamble\_Initial\_Power.

\- The Power offset Pp-e = P~dpcch~ -- P~preamble~, measured in dB,
between the power of the last transmitted preamble and the initial DPCCH
transmission power.

\- The number of TTIs in which only the uplink DPCCH is sent before the
E-DCH transmission may start for 2 and 10ms TTI.

Note that the above parameters may be updated from higher layers before
each physical random access procedure is initiated.

At each initiation of the physical random access procedure, Layer 1
shall receive the following information from the higher layers (MAC):

\- The ASC of the PRACH transmission.

If Concurrent\_TTI\_Deployment\_Enabled is TRUE, Layer 1 shall also
receive the following additional parameters from the higher layers
(MAC):

\- TTI length, either 2 or 10ms.

The procedure for the selection of the TTI length is defined in
subclause 8.5.b1 in \[5\]. The TTI length may be updated by higher
layers before each preamble retransmission.

The physical random-access procedure shall be performed as follows:

1 If NT-HS-DPCCH\_Enabled is FALSE, or if NT-HS-DPCCH\_Enabled is TRUE
and the physical random-access procedure is not triggered by an HS-SCCH
order, then derive the available uplink access slots, in the next full
access slot set or in the next 8 access slots, for the set of available
RACH sub-channels within the given ASC with the help of subclauses
6.1.1. and 6.1.2. Randomly select one access slot among the ones
previously determined. If there is no access slot available in the
selected set, randomly select one uplink access slot corresponding to
the set of available RACH sub-channels within the given ASC from the
next access slot set or in the next 7 access slots. The random function
shall be such that each of the allowed selections is chosen with equal
probability. If NT-HS-DPCCH\_Enabled is TRUE and the physical
random-access procedure is triggered by an HS-SCCH order, then the next
available access slot is chosen.

2 If Concurrent\_TTI\_Deployment\_Enabled is TRUE, the scrambling code
corresponding to the indicated TTI length is chosen.

2a Randomly select a signature from the set of available signatures
within the given ASC and indicated scrambling code. The random function
shall be such that each of the allowed selections is chosen with equal
probability. If Concurrent\_TTI\_Deployment\_Enabled is TRUE, the set of
available signatures corresponds to the indicated TTI length.

3 Set the Preamble Retransmission Counter to Preamble Retrans Max.

4 If the Preamble\_Initial\_Power is below the minimum level required in
\[7\], set the Commanded Preamble Power to a value, which shall be at or
above the Preamble\_Initial\_Power and at or below the required minimum
power specified in \[7\]. Otherwise set the parameter Commanded Preamble
Power to Preamble\_Initial\_Power.

5 In the case that the Commanded Preamble Power exceeds the maximum
allowed value, set the preamble transmission power to the maximum
allowed power. In the case that the Commanded Preamble Power is below
the minimum level required in \[7\], set the preamble transmission power
to a value, which shall be at or above the Commanded Preamble Power and
at or below the required minimum power specified in \[7\]. Otherwise set
the preamble transmission power to the Commanded Preamble Power.
Transmit a preamble using the selected uplink access slot, signature,
and preamble transmission power.

6 If no positive or negative acquisition indicator (AI ≠ +1 nor --1)
corresponding to the selected signature is detected in the downlink
access slot corresponding to the selected uplink access slot:

6.1 Select the next available access slot in the set of available RACH
sub-channels within the given ASC.

6.2 Randomly select a new signature from the set of available signatures
within the given ASC. The random function shall be such that each of the
allowed selections is chosen with equal probability. If an update to the
TTI length is indicated by higher layers, then the set of available
signatures and the preamble scrambling code are also updated
correspondingly.

6.3 Increase the Commanded Preamble Power by ∆P~0~ = Power Ramp Step
\[dB\]. If the **Commanded Preamble Power** exceeds the maximum allowed
power by 6dB, the UE may pass L1 status (\"No ack on AICH\") to the
higher layers (MAC) and exit the physical random access procedure.

6.4 Decrease the Preamble Retransmission Counter by one.

6.5 If the Preamble Retransmission Counter \> 0 then repeat from step 5.
Otherwise pass L1 status (\"No ack on AICH\") to the higher layers (MAC)
and exit the physical random access procedure.

7 If a negative acquisition indicator on AICH corresponding to the
selected signature is detected in the downlink access slot corresponding
to the selected uplink access slot.

> 7.1 If no Extended Acquisition Indicator signature set is configured
> in the cell, pass L1 status ("Nack on AICH received") to the higher
> layers (MAC) and exit the physical random access procedure.
>
> 7.2 If an Extended Acquisition Indicator signature set is configured
> in the cell, detect which one of the defined Extended Acquisition
> Indicator signatures is present.
>
> 7.2.1 If the detected Extended Acquisition Indicator signature and
> modulation symbol corresponds to 'NACK' as defined in \[1\], pass L1
> status ("Nack on AICH received") to the higher layers (MAC) and exit
> the physical random access procedure.
>
> 7.2.2 If the detected Extended Acquisition Indicator signature and
> modulation symbol do not correspond to 'NACK', pass L1 status ("Ack on
> AICH received") with the corresponding E-DCH resource index as defined
> in \[1\] to higher layers (MAC) and skip step 8.
>
> 8 If a positive acquisition indicator on AICH corresponding to the
> selected signature is detected in the downlink access slot
> corresponding to the selected uplink access slot, pass L1 status ("Ack
> on AICH received") with the default E-DCH resource index corresponding
> to the selected signature as defined in \[1\] to higher layers (MAC),

9 Start transmitting DPCCH (timing as specified in \[1\] and
synchronization according to synchronization procedure AA). The initial
transmission power of DPCCH prior to starting the E-DCH transmission
should be\
Pp-e  \[dB\] higher than the power of the last transmitted preamble.

10 Proceed to transmitting E-DPCCH and E-DPDCH, and transmit HS-DPCCH if
so instructed by MAC layer after the defined number of TTIs of DPCCH
only transmission has passed.

same scrambling code as that of P-CPICH) in case the UE is configured in
MIMO mode with four transmit antennas.

9\) The number *N* of dynamic single/dual CQI reports out of a sequence

22\) HS-SCCH set to be monitored in the assisting secondary serving
HS-DSCH cell

23\) CQI\_CYCLE\_SWITCH\_TIMER, which specifies the number of subframes
without HS-PDSCH transmissions to the UE for the purpose of switching
CQI feedback cycle to CQI feedback cycle2. This is the initial value of
"CQI cycle switch timer".

If HS\_SCCH\_LESS\_STATUS is TRUE then HS-SCCH\_less\_mode=1. Otherwise
HS-SCCH\_less\_mode=0.

HS-SCCH-less\_Active shall be set to TRUE while HS-SCCH\_less\_mode=1
and HS-SCCH-less operation is activated. Otherwise HS-SCCH\_less\_Active
shall be set to FALSE. HS-SCCH-less operation shall be activated at the
time when HS-SCCH\_less\_mode is set to 1, and may be further
deactivated or activated by HS-SCCH orders as specified in \[2\]. This
ordered deactivation or activation of the HS-SCCH-less operation is
applied by the UE 12 slots after the end of the HS-SCCH subframe
delivering the order.

If the higher layers set DTX\_DRX\_STATUS to TRUE (as described in
\[5\]) then UE\_DTX\_DRX\_Enabled is FALSE until Enabling\_Delay radio
frames have passed. After the higher layers have set DTX\_DRX\_STATUS to
TRUE (as described in \[5\]) and Enabling\_Delay radio frames have
passed then UE\_DTX\_DRX\_Enabled is TRUE. Otherwise
UE\_DTX\_DRX\_Enabled is FALSE.

If the UE is not configured in Multiflow mode;

\- If the UE is configured with at least one secondary serving HS-DSCH
cell, then Secondary\_Cell\_Enabled is equal to the number of the
configured secondary serving HS-DSCH cells, otherwise
Secondary\_Cell\_Enabled is 0 and Secondary\_Cell\_Active is 0.

\- Configured secondary serving HS-DSCH cells shall be activated at the
time when Secondary\_Cell\_Enabled is changed from 0 to a value not
equal to 0, or

\- The activation status for configured secondary HS-DSCH cell(s) shall
be set as specified in \[5\] when Secondary\_Cell\_Enabled is changed
from a value n (where n is greater than 0) to a value m (where m is a
value greater than 0). Configured secondary serving HS-DSCH cells may
further be deactivated or activated by HS-SCCH orders as specified in
\[2\].

\- Secondary\_Cell\_Active shall be set to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 while
Secondary\_Cell\_Enabled is set to a value not equal to 0, and 1, 2, 3,
4, 5, 6, or 7 secondary serving HS-DSCH cells are activated
respectively; otherwise Secondary\_Cell\_Active shall be set to 0.

\- If the UE receives an HS-SCCH order for activation of a secondary
serving HS-DSCH cell that is already activated as specified in \[2\],
then the UE shall not change the activation status of that secondary
serving HS-DSCH cell, but shall transmit the HARQ-ACK acknowledging the
HS-SCCH order.

If the UE is configured in Multiflow mode and with a secondary serving
cell or an assisting secondary serving cell, all the configured cell(s)
are initially activated, and may further be deactivated or activated
using HS-SCCH orders.

> \- The Secondary Serving HS-DSCH cell can be deactivated with an order
> transmitted only by the Serving or the Secondary Serving HS-DSCH cell
> and reactivated with an order transmitted only by the serving HS-DSCH
> cell.
>
> \- The Assisting Secondary Serving HS-DSCH cell can be deactivated
> with an order transmitted only by the Assisting Serving or Assisting
> Secondary Serving HS-DSCH cell and reactivated with an order
> transmitted only by the Assisting Serving HS-DSCH cell.
>
> \- If the UE receives an HS-SCCH order for activation of a Secondary
> Serving HS-DSCH or Assisting Secondary Serving cell that is already
> activated as specified in \[2\], then the UE shall not change the
> activation status of that secondary serving HS-DSCH cell, but shall
> transmit the HARQ-ACK acknowledging the HS-SCCH order.
>
> \- If the higher layers indicate a change in the HS-DSCH cells,

\- if the new configuration contains a Secondary Serving HS-DSCH cell
that was either the Secondary Serving or Assisting Secondary Serving
HS-DSCH cell in the earlier configuration and the cell was deactivated
with HS-SCCH orders, it shall remain deactivated. Otherwise after the
change the Secondary Serving HS-DSCH cell shall be active.

\- if the new configuration contains an Assisting Secondary Serving
HS-DSCH cell that was either the Secondary Serving or Assisting
Secondary Serving HS-DSCH cell in the earlier configuration and the cell
was deactivated with HS-SCCH orders, it shall remain deactivated.
Otherwise after the change the Assisting Secondary Serving HS-DSCH cell
shall be active.

If the UE is not configured with multiple uplink frequencies, HS-SCCH
ordered deactivation or activation of the secondary serving HS-DSCH
cell(s) or the Assisting Secondary Serving HS-DSCH cell is applied by
the UE 12 slots after the end of the HS-SCCH subframe delivering the
order, and any transient behaviour related to this change should take
place before this point in time. If the activation statuses of all
secondary serving HS-DSCH cells in a frequency band (as defined in
\[7\]) remain unaffected by an HS-SCCH ordered deactivation or
activation the maximum allowed interruption time for the cells in this
band is 1 slot and the interrupt shall take place during the next
downlink HS-SCCH slot after the end of the HS-DPCCH slot that contains
the HARQ-ACK information acknowledging the HS-SCCH order. The
corresponding change of the HS-DPCCH channel coding scheme as specified
in \[2\] is applied by the UE at the first HS-DPCCH subframe boundary
after the activation or deactivation has been applied.

If the UE is configured with multiple uplink frequencies, HS-SCCH
ordered deactivation or activation of the secondary serving HS-DSCH
cell(s) or the Assisting Secondary Serving HS-DSCH cell is applied by
the UE 18 slots after the end of the HS-SCCH subframe delivering the
order, and any transient behaviour related to this change should take
place before this point in time. If:

\- the activation statuses of all secondary serving HS-DSCH cells in a
frequency band (as defined in \[7\]) remain unaffected by the HS-SCCH
ordered deactivation or activation and the serving HS-DSCH cell is not
configured in this band or

\- the activation statuses of all secondary serving HS-DSCH cells and
the secondary uplink frequency in a frequency band remain unaffected by
the HS-SCCH ordered deactivation or activation and the serving HS-DSCH
cell is configured in this band

The maximum allowed interruption time for the downlink cells and uplink
frequencies configured in this frequency band is 1 slot. The interrupt
shall take place during the next downlink HS-SCCH slot after the end of
the HS-DPCCH slot that contains the HARQ-ACK information acknowledging
the HS-SCCH order. The corresponding change of the HS-DPCCH channel
coding scheme as specified in \[2\] is applied by the UE at the first
HS-DPCCH subframe boundary after the activation or deactivation has been
applied.

### 6A.1.1 UE procedure for receiving HS-DSCH and HS-SCCH in the CELL\_DCH state

NOTE: The Node B procedure for transmitting the HS-DSCH and the HS-SCCH
is specified in subclause 6A.1.3.

In this subclause, sub-frame *n* on the HS-SCCHs refers to the sub-frame
which is associated with sub-frame *n* on the HS-PDSCH as defined in
\[1\], and sub-frame *n* on the HS-DPCCH refers to the sub-frame which
is related to sub-frame *n* on the HS-PDSCH as defined in \[1\].

If the UE did not detect consistent control information intended for
this UE on any of the HS-SCCHs in the HS-SCCH set in the immediately
preceding subframe *n *-- 1, the UE shall in sub-frame *n* monitor all
HS-SCCHs in the HS-SCCH set. The maximum size of the HS-SCCH set in the
serving HS-DSCH cell is 4.

If 64QAM is not configured for the UE and 'Support for different
HS-SCCHs in contiguous TTIs' is false, then if the UE did detect
consistent control information intended for this UE in the immediately
preceding subframe *n* -- 1, it is sufficient in sub-frame *n* to only
monitor the same HS-SCCH used in the immediately preceding subframe
*n *-- 1. If 64QAM is configured for the UE or 'Support for different
HS-SCCHs in contiguous TTIs' is true, then if the UE did detect
consistent control information intended for this UE in the immediately
preceding subframe *n* -- 1, the UE shall in sub-frame *n* monitor all
HS-SCCHs in the HS-SCCH set. These rules apply regardless of the value
of HS-SCCH\_less\_mode.

If Secondary\_Cell\_Active is not 0 and the UE is not configured in
Multiflow mode,

\- The UE shall simultaneously monitor an HS-SCCH set in each of the
activated secondary serving HS-DSCH cells, and receive HS-DSCH if it is
scheduled in that cell. The maximum size of the HS-SCCH set in a
secondary serving HS-DSCH cell is 4 and the maximum number of HS-SCCHs
monitored by the UE across

\- both the serving HS-DSCH cell and the secondary serving HS-DSCH cell
is 6 if the UE is capable of HS-DSCH reception in a maximum of 2 cells.

\- the serving HS-DSCH cell, the 1^st^ and 2^nd^ secondary serving
HS-DSCH cells is 9 if the UE is capable of HS-DSCH reception in a
maximum of 3 cells.

\- the serving HS-DSCH cell, the 1^st^ , 2^nd^ and 3^rd^ secondary
serving HS-DSCH cells is 12 if the UE is capable of HS-DSCH reception in
4 cells.

\- the serving HS-DSCH cell, the 1^st^, 2^nd^, 3^rd^ and 4^th^ secondary
serving HS-DSCH cells is 15 if the UE is capable of HS-DSCH reception in
5 cells.

\- the serving HS-DSCH cell, the 1^st^, 2^nd^, 3^rd^, 4^th^ and 5^th^
secondary serving HS-DSCH cells is 18 if the UE is capable of HS-DSCH
reception in 6 cells.

\- the serving HS-DSCH cell, the 1^st^, 2^nd^, 3^rd^, 4^th^, 5^th^ and
6^th^ secondary serving HS-DSCH cells is 21 if the UE is capable of
HS-DSCH reception in 7 cells.

\- the serving HS-DSCH cell, the 1^st^, 2^nd^, 3^rd^, 4^th^, 5^th^,
6^th^ and 7^th^ secondary serving HS-DSCH cells is 24 if the UE is
capable of HS-DSCH reception in 8 cells.

\- From the serving HS-DSCH cell, the UE shall be able to receive up to
one HS-DSCH if MIMO mode and MIMO mode with four transmit antennas is
not configured or two HS-DSCHs if MIMO mode is configured or four
HS-DSCHs if MIMO mode with four transmit antennas is configured or one
HS-SCCH order.

\- In addition, from each of the activated secondary serving HS-DSCH
cells, the UE shall be able to simultaneously receive up to one HS-DSCH
if MIMO mode and MIMO mode with four transmit antennas is not configured
or two HS-DSCHs if MIMO mode is configured or four HS-DSCHs if MIMO mode
with four transmit antennas is configured or one HS-SCCH order.

\- The maximum number of HS-SCCH orders simultaneously received by the
UE across the serving HS-DSCH cell and all the activated secondary
serving HS-DSCH cells is 2.

\- HS-SCCH-less HS-DSCH transmission shall not be used in a secondary
serving HS-DSCH cell.

\- The UE behaviour is unspecified in case more than two HS-SCCH orders
are received simultaneously or contradictory HS-SCCH orders (i.e. orders
for activation and deactivation of the same functionality) are received
from the serving HS-DSCH cell and/or any of the secondary serving
HS-DSCH cells during the same subframe.

If the UE is configured in Multiflow mode

\- The UE shall simultaneously monitor an HS-SCCH set in each of the
activated serving, assisting serving, secondary serving and assisting
secondary serving HS-DSCH cells, and receive HS-DSCH if it is scheduled
in that cell. The maximum size of the HS-SCCH set in any cell is 4 and
the maximum number of HS-SCCHs monitored by the UE across

\- both the serving HS-DSCH cell and the assisting serving HS-DSCH cell
is 6 if the UE is capable of HS-DSCH reception in a maximum of 2 cells
in Multiflow mode.

\- the (secondary) serving HS-DSCH cell(s) and the assisting (secondary)
serving HS-DSCH cell(s) is 9 if the UE is capable of HS-DSCH reception
in a maximum of 3 cells in Multiflow mode.

\- the (secondary) serving HS-DSCH cell(s) and the assisting (secondary)
serving HS-DSCH cell(s) is 12 if the UE is capable of HS-DSCH reception
in a maximum of 4 cells in Multiflow mode.

\- From the serving HS-DSCH cell, the UE shall be able to receive up to
one HS-DSCH if MIMO mode is not configured or two HS-DSCHs if MIMO mode
is configured or one HS-SCCH order.

\- In addition, from each of the assisting serving and the activated
(assisting) secondary serving HS-DSCH cell(s), the UE shall be able to
simultaneously receive up to one HS-DSCH if MIMO mode is not configured
or two HS-DSCHs if MIMO mode is configured or one HS-SCCH order.

\- HS-SCCH-less HS-DSCH transmission shall not be used in any cell other
than the serving HS-DSCH cell.

\- The UE behaviour is unspecified in case more than two HS-SCCH orders
are received simultaneously or contradictory HS-SCCH orders (i.e. orders
for activation and deactivation of the same functionality) are received
simultaneously.

The UE can be configured to simultaneously monitor a maximum of 1
HS-SCCH in one non-serving cell. This HS-SCCH is only used for HS-SCCH
orders that indicate HS-DSCH serving cell change as defined in subclause
4.6C.2.2.1 in \[2\]. Upon successfully receiving an HS-SCCH order that
indicates HS-DSCH serving cell change from this non-serving cell, the UE
shall be able to start listening to the full configured HS-SCCH set from
this new serving cell and from the new secondary serving HS-DSCH cells
if configured by higher layers, at the activation time configured by
higher layers if the activation time is not equal to "now", or otherwise
within 40 ms from the end of the subframe in which the HS-SCCH order is
received.

When the UE monitors HS-SCCHs, the UE shall only consider the control
information to be consistent if either:

\- the decoded \'channelization-code-set information\' is lower than or
equal to \'maximum number of HS-DSCH codes received\' in its UE
capability and the decoded \'modulation scheme information\' is valid in
terms of its UE capability,

or

\- the decoded \'channelization-code-set information\' and decoded
'modulation scheme information' correspond to an indication of an
HS-SCCH order as defined in \[2\] subclause 4.6C.2.

Control information for one UE shall not be transmitted from the serving
cell on more than one HS-SCCH in a single sub-frame.

If a UE detects that one of the monitored HS-SCCHs in sub-frame *n*
carries consistent control information intended for this UE, the UE
shall perform the following:

\- If the decoded \'channelization-code-set information\' and decoded
'modulation scheme information' do not correspond to an indication of an
HS-SCCH order, start receiving the HS-PDSCHs indicated by this
consistent control information

\- If **HS-DPCCH overhead reduction Type 2** and DPDCH are configured,
the used\_CQI \_feedback\_cycle is set to CQI feedback cycle, and the
"CQI cycle switch timer" is reset to CQI\_CYCLE\_SWITCH\_TIMER.

> \- If the CRC of the HS-SCCH is OK:

\- If HS-SCCH\_less\_mode=1 and the TFRI value corresponds to the
retransmissions of HS-SCCH-less operation, the transport block size
information shall be derived from the signalled transport block size
indicator as defined in \[5\] and \[9\].

\- Else if UE\_DTX\_DRX\_Enabled is TRUE or HS-SCCH\_less\_mode=1 or
Secondary\_Cell\_Enabled is not 0 or UL\_CLTD\_Enabled is TRUE or UE is
configured in MIMO mode with four transmit antennas or UE is configured
in Multiflow mode or UE is configured in Enhanced TTI switching, and the
'channelization-code-set information' and 'modulation scheme
information' correspond to an HS-SCCH order, the UE shall:

\- if the TFRI value corresponds to an HS-SCCH order as defined in \[2\]
subclause 4.6C.2,

\- If the HS-SCCH order was sent by the serving HS-DSCH cell or by one
of the secondary serving HS-DSCH cells, transmit ACK information in the
slot allocated to the HARQ-ACK in the corresponding HS-DPCCH sub-frame
as defined in \[1\] and \[2\];

\- Process the HS-SCCH orders as described in subclauses 6A.1, 6B,
6B.3.0, 6C.4, 10.6, 11.6 and 12.5.

\- else, discard the information received on this HS-SCCH.

\- Else, the transport block size information shall be derived from the
signalled TFRI value as defined in \[9\].

\- If the \'Hybrid-ARQ process information\' is not included in the set
configured by upper layers, the UE shall discard the information
received on this HS-SCCH and on the HS-PDSCHs.

\- Else, if HS-SCCH\_less\_Active is TRUE, the UE may start receiving
the HS-PDSCHs configured for HS-SCCH-less operation and attempt to
decode the HS-DSCH bits based on the set of possible HS-DSCH transport
block sizes configured for HS-SCCH-less operation. Otherwise, the UE
shall discard the information received on this HS-SCCH and HS-PDSCH.

Otherwise, if the UE does not detect consistent control information
intended for this UE on any of the HS-SCCHs in its HS-SCCH sets, the UE
shall perform the following:

\- the UE shall discard the information received on this HS-SCCH.

\- if HS-SCCH\_less\_Active is TRUE, the UE shall start receiving the
HS-PDSCHs configured for HS-SCCH-less operation and attempt to decode
the HS-DSCH bits based on the set of possible HS-DSCH transport block
sizes configured for HS-SCCH-less operation.

\- otherwise, the UE shall discard the information received on the
HS-PDSCHs.

\- if **HS-DPCCH overhead reduction Type 2** **and DPDCH are**
configured, the "CQI cycle switch timer" is decremented by one. If the
"CQI cycle switch timer" has expired, then the UE shall set the
used\_CQI\_feedback\_cycle to CQI feedback cycle2.

If UL\_DTX\_Active is TRUE (see clause 6C) and either of the following
is true:

\- the UE detects consistent control information intended for this UE
and the TFRI value does not correspond to an HS-SCCH order, or

\- the UE has successfully decoded HS-PDSCHs intended for this UE;

then, at the HS-DPCCH sub frame that contains or would contain the
HARQ-ACK corresponding to the HS-SCCH or to the HS-PDSCHs that generated
the priority change, the UE shall perform the following:

\- set CQI\_DTX\_Priority to 1 and,

\- reset the CQI nominal reporting timer to CQI\_DTX\_TIMER.

If HARQ\_preamble\_mode = 1 and the information received on HS-SCCH is
not discarded, the UE shall:

\- transmit a HARQ Preamble (PRE for HS-DPCCH slot format 0 or PRE/PRE
for HS-DPCCH slot format 1) in the slot allocated to HARQ-ACK in
HS-DPCCH sub-frame *n* -- 1 (if two HS-DPCCHs are active then a HARQ
preamble is sent on each of HS-DPCCH and HS-DPCCH~2~), unless an ACK or
NACK or any combination of ACK and NACK is to be transmitted in
sub-frame *n* -- 1 as a result of an HS-DSCH transmission earlier than
sub-frame *n* on the HS-PDSCH, and

\- if N\_acknack\_transmit \> 1, the UE shall transmit a HARQ Preamble
in the slot allocated to HARQ‑ACK in HS-DPCCH sub-frame *n* -- 2 (if two
HS-DPCCHs are active then a HARQ preamble is sent on each of HS-DPCCH
and HS-DPCCH~2~), unless an ACK or NACK or any combination of ACK and
NACK is to be transmitted in sub-frame *n* -- 2 as a result of an
HS-DSCH transmission earlier than sub-frame *n* on the HS-PDSCH.

\- if N\_acknack\_transmit \_2\> 1, the UE is configured in Multiflow
mode and the HS-SCCH corresponds to an assisting serving or assisting
secondary serving cell, then the UE shall transmit a HARQ Preamble in
the slot allocated to HARQ‑ACK in HS-DPCCH sub-frame *n* -- 2, unless an
ACK or NACK or any combination of ACK and NACK is to be transmitted in
sub-frame *n* -- 2 as a result of an HS-DSCH transmission earlier than
sub-frame *n* on the HS-PDSCH.

> The UE shall transmit the ACK/NACK information received from MAC-hs or
> MAC-ehs in the slot allocated to the HARQ-ACK in the corresponding
> HS-DPCCH sub-frame as defined in \[1\] and \[2\].
>
> When *N\_ acknack\_transmit* is greater than one, the UE shall:

\- repeat the transmission of the ACK/NACK information over the next
(*N\_ acknack\_transmit-1*) consecutive HS-DPCCH sub-frames, in the
slots allocated to the HARQ-ACK as defined in \[1\] and

\- not attempt to receive any HS-SCCH in HS-SCCH subframes corresponding
to HS-DPCCH sub-frames in which the ACK/NACK information transmission is
repeated, nor to receive or decode transport blocks from the HS-PDSCH in
HS-DSCH sub-frames corresponding to HS-DPCCH sub-frames in which the
ACK/NACK information transmission is repeated.

### 6A.1.1A UE procedure for receiving HS-DSCH and HS-SCCH in CELL\_FACH state

The HS-SCCH reception procedure is as defined in subclause 6A.1.1.

The UE shall perform these actions in the following order:

\- The UE shall monitor the first indexed HS-SCCH of the configured
HS-SCCH set with the BCCH specific H-RNTI.

\- If the UE is configured with a dedicated H-RNTI, the UE shall monitor
the HS-SCCHs of the configured HS-SCCH set with the dedicated H-RNTI. If
the UE is not configured with a dedicated H-RNTI, the UE shall monitor
the HS-SCCHs of the configured HS-SCCH set with the common H-RNTI as
defined in \[5\].

If the higher layers configure NodeB triggered HS-DPCCH transmission (as
described in \[5\]) then NT-HS-DPCCH\_Enabled is set to TRUE. Otherwise,
NT-HS-DPCCH\_Enabled is set to FALSE.

If the UE detects that one HS-SCCH carries consistent control
information intended for this UE, the UE shall perform the following:

\- If the decoded \'channelization-code-set information\' and decoded
'modulation scheme information' do not correspond to an indication of an
HS-SCCH order, start receiving the HS-PDSCHs indicated by this
consistent control information.

\- If the CRC of the HS-SCCH is OK:

\- If the 'channelization-code-set information' and 'modulation scheme
information' correspond to an HS-SCCH order as defined in \[2\]
subclause 4.6C.3,

\- if the TFRI value corresponds to an HS-SCCH order and the order
mapping is as per subclause 4.6C.3.2.1, the UE shall process the HS-SCCH
orders as described in subclause 6B. If NT-HS-DPCCH\_Enabled is TRUE,
the UE shall not transmit the associated HARQ-ACK information
acknowledging the HS-SCCH order.

\- if the TFRI value corresponds to an HS-SCCH order and the order
mapping is as per subclause 4.6C.3.2.2, the UE shall process the HS-SCCH
order as described in \[5\].

\- else, discard the information received on this HS-SCCH

\- Else, the transport block size information shall be derived from the
signalled TFRI value as defined in \[9\]. If the \'Hybrid-ARQ process
information\' is not included in the set configured by upper layers, the
UE shall discard the information received on this HS-SCCH and on the
HS-PDSCHs.

Otherwise, if the UE does not detect consistent control information
intended for this UE on any of the HS-SCCHs, the UE shall discard the
information received on this HS-SCCH and on the HS-PDSCHs.

If HS-DPCCH transmission is indicated by higher layers, the HS-DPCCH
transmission procedure as defined in subclauses 6A.1.1 and 6A.1.2 are
followed. Otherwise, the UE shall not transmit any HARQ-ACK or CQI
information and DTX shall be used on all the HS-DPCCH subframes.

### 6A.1.1B UE procedure for receiving HS-DSCH and HS-SCCH in the URA\_PCH and CELL\_PCH states

The HS-SCCH reception procedure is as defined in subclause 6A.1.1.

If the UE has detected a paging indication intended for this UE, the UE
shall perform the actions below:

In CELL\_PCH state, if the UE is configured with a dedicated H-RNTI, the
UE shall perform these actions in the following order:

\- The UE shall monitor the first indexed HS-SCCH of the configured
HS-SCCH set with the BCCH specific H-RNTI.

\- The UE shall monitor the HS-SCCHs of the configured HS-SCCH set with
the dedicated H-RNTI.

In CELL\_PCH state, if the higher layers configure NodeB triggered
HS-DPCCH transmission (as described in \[5\]) then NT-HS-DPCCH\_Enabled
is set to TRUE. Otherwise, NT-HS-DPCCH\_Enabled is set to FALSE.

If the UE is configured with a dedicated H-RNTI, and if the UE detects
that one HS-SCCH in a set of 5 associated HS-SCCH subframes (as defined
in \[1\]) carries consistent control information intended for this UE,
the UE shall perform the following:

\- If the decoded \'channelization-code-set information\' and decoded
'modulation scheme information' do not correspond to an indication of an
HS-SCCH order, start receiving the HS-PDSCHs indicated by this
consistent control information.

\- If the CRC of the HS-SCCH is OK,

\- If the 'channelization-code-set information' and 'modulation scheme
information' correspond to an HS-SCCH order as defined in \[2\]
subclause 4.6C.3,

\- if the TFRI value corresponds to an HS-SCCH order, the UE shall
process the HS-SCCH orders as described in subclause 6B. If
NT-HS-DPCCH\_Enabled is TRUE, the UE shall not transmit the associated
HARQ-ACK information acknowledging the HS-SCCH order.

\- else, discard the information received on this HS-SCCH

\- Else, the transport block size information shall be derived from the
signalled TFRI value as defined in \[9\]. If the \'Hybrid-ARQ process
information\' is not included in the set configured by upper layers, the
UE shall discard the information received on this HS-SCCH and on the
HS-PDSCHs.

If the UE is configured with a dedicated H-RNTI and the UE does not
detect consistent control information intended for this UE on any of the
HS-SCCHs, the UE shall discard the information received on this HS-SCCH
and on the HS-PDSCHs.

In CELL\_PCH state, when the UE is configured to receive HS-DSCH without
a dedicated H-RNTI, or in URA\_PCH state, the UE shall perform the
following:

\- the UE shall start receiving the HS-PDSCH configured for HS-SCCH-less
operation and attempt to decode the HS-DSCH bits of the first associated
HS-DSCH sub-frame (as defined in \[1\]) and the subsequent repetitions
in the (Number of PCCH transmissions-1) next contiguous HS-DSCH
subframes based on the set of possible HS-DSCH Transport Block Sizes
configured by higher layers.

The UE shall not transmit any HARQ-ACK or CQI information and DTX shall
be used on all the HS-DPCCH subframes.

### 6A.1.2 UE procedure for reporting channel quality indication (CQI) and precoding control indication (PCI)

The UE procedure for reporting PCI/CQI is given in subclause 6A.1.2.1
for the case when the UE is not configured in MIMO mode and not
configured in MIMO mode with four transmit antennas in any cell, in
subclause 6A.1.2.2 for the case when the UE is configured in MIMO mode
in all cells, and in subclause 6A.1.2.3 for the case when the UE is
configured in MIMO mode with four transmit antennas in all cells.

If the UE is configured in MIMO mode in at least one cell, but not in
all cells and is not configured in MIMO mode with four transmit antennas
in any cell, then the overall PCI/CQI reporting procedure shall be the
same as if the UE was configured in MIMO mode in all cells as specified
in subclause 6A.1.2.2 except that a CQI value as defined in subclause
6A.2.1 is derived and reported for the non-MIMO cells.

In the following subclauses, symbol k represents the
used\_CQI\_feedback\_cycle. The used\_CQI\_feedback\_cycle is always set
to CQI feedback cycle, except when the **HS-DPCCH overhead reduction
Type 2** is configured, in which case the used\_CQI\_feedback\_cycle may
change from the set value according to the rules defined in subclause
6A.1.1. When the UE is provided with a HS-DSCH configuration the
used\_CQI\_feedback\_cycle is reset to CQI feedback cycle.

#### 6A.1.2.1 CQI reporting procedure in case the UE is not configured in MIMO mode and not configured in MIMO mode with four transmit antennas in any cell

With the exception of the provisions of subclause 6A.3, the following
shall apply when the UE is not configured in MIMO mode and not
configured in MIMO mode with four transmit antennas in any cell:

1\) The UE derives the CQI value for the serving HS-DSCH cell as defined
in subclause 6A.2.1.

> If the UE is not configured in Multiflow mode and
> Secondary\_Cell\_Active is not 0, the UE also derives a CQI value for
> the activated secondary serving HS-DSCH cells as defined in subclause
> 6A.2.1.

>
> The CQI report(s) are constructed from the CQI value(s) as specified
> in \[2\].

2\) For k = 0, the UE shall not transmit the CQI report(s).\
For k \> 0 when DTX\_DRX\_STATUS is not TRUE, the UE shall transmit the
CQI report containing the CQI value for the serving HS-DSCH cell in each
subframe that starts *m*×256 chips after the start of the associated
uplink DPCCH frame with *m* fulfilling:

${\left( 5 \times \text{CFN} + \left\lceil m \times \text{256}\text{chip}/\text{7680}\text{chip} \right\rceil \right)\text{mod\ \{}k}^{'} = 0$
with $k^{'} = k/(2\text{ms})$,

where CFN denotes the connection frame number for the associated DPCH
and the set of five possible values of *m* is calculated as described in
subclause 7.7 in \[1\].

> For k \> 0 when DTX\_DRX\_STATUS is TRUE, the UE shall transmit the
> CQI report containing the CQI value for the serving HS-DSCH cell as
> specified in 6C.2 based on the CQI transmission pattern. The CQI
> transmission pattern is the set of HS-DPCCH subframes whose HS-DPCCH
> discontinuous transmission radio frame number CFN\_DRX and subframe
> number S\_DRX, both defined in 6C.3, verify:

((5\*CFN\_DRX - UE\_DTX\_DRX\_Offset + S\_DRX ) **MOD** k\') = 0, with
$k^{'} = k/(2\text{ms})$.

3\) The UE shall repeat the transmission of the CQI report containing
the CQI value for the serving HS-DSCH cell derived in 1) over the next
*(N\_cqi\_transmit -- 1)* consecutive HS-DPCCH sub frames in the slots
respectively allocated to the CQI as defined in \[1\]. UE does not
support the case of $k^{'} < N_{\text{cqi}_{\text{transmit}}}$.

4a) If Secondary\_Cell\_Enabled is less than 4, the UE is not in
Multiflow mode, and if an additional CQI report is derived in 1), the UE
shall transmit this CQI report over the next *N\_cqi\_transmit*
consecutive HS-DPCCH sub frames immediately following the transmission
of the CQI report in 2) and 3). UE does not support the case of
$k^{'} < 2 \cdot N_{\text{cqi}_{\text{transmit}}}$.

> 4b) If Secondary\_Cell\_Enabled is 7 and Secondary\_Cell\_Active is 7
> the UE shall for the activated cells
>
> \- Transmit the CQI report containing the CQI value of the 4^th^
> secondary serving HS-DSCH cell simultaneously as the CQI report
> containing the CQI value of the serving HS-DSCH cell.
>
> \- Transmit the CQI report containing the CQI value of the 6^th^
> secondary serving HS-DSCH cell simultaneously as the CQI report
> containing the CQI value of the 2^nd^ secondary serving HS-DSCH cell
>
> \- Transmit the CQI report containing the CQI value of the 5^th^
> secondary serving HS-DSCH cell simultaneously as the CQI report
> containing the CQI value of the 1^st^ secondary serving HS-DSCH cell
>
> \- Transmit the CQI report containing the CQI value of the 7^th^

> The CQI report is transmitted over *(N\_cqi\_transmit -- 1)*
> consecutive HS-DPCCH sub frames. The UE does not support the case of
> $k^{'} < 2 \cdot N_{\text{cqi}_{\text{transmit}}}$.

4c) If Secondary\_Cell\_Enabled is greater than 3 and
Secondary\_Cell\_Active is less than 7 the UE shall

> \- For HS-DPCCH
>
> \- Transmit the CQI reports in the same slots as it would transmit the

4d) If the UE is configured in the Multiflow mode

4d.1) If the UE is configured with the Serving HS-DSCH and Assisting
Serving HS-DSCH only, and neither of the cells is in MIMO mode, the
combined CQI report is transmitted and repeated as defined in steps 2)
and 3) and no other CQI reports are sent. The CQI reports are
constructed from the CQI value(s) as specified in subclause 4.7.4.3.1,

described in 2), 3) , 4a), 4b), 4c) and 4d).

#### 6A.1.2.2 Composite PCI/CQI reporting procedure in case the UE is configured in MIMO mode

The following types of CQI reports have to be supported by the UE when
the UE is configured in MIMO mode and single-stream restriction is not
configured:

Type A CQI reports that indicate the supported transport format(s) for
the number of simultaneously transmitted transport blocks that the UE
prefers according to the current channel conditions assuming that the
preferred primary precoding vector as indicated by the PCI value
signalled in the same HS-DPCCH sub-frame would be applied at the Node-B
for the primary transport block and in case two transport blocks are
preferred the precoding vector orthogonal to the preferred primary
precoding vector would be applied for the secondary transport block.
This type of CQI report contains information on either one transport
format or a combination of two transport formats depending on what is
currently the preferred number of transport blocks (either 1 or 2).

Type B CQI reports that indicate the supported transport format for a
single transmitted transport block according to the current channel
conditions assuming that the preferred primary precoding vector as
indicated by the PCI value signalled in the same HS-DPCCH sub-frame
would be applied at the Node-B for the primary transport block and that
no secondary transport block is transmitted.

When UE is configured in MIMO mode and single-stream restriction is
configured only type B CQI report have to be supported by the UE.

With the exception of the provisions of subclause 6A.3, the following
shall apply when the UE is configured in MIMO mode:

1\) The UE derives the PCI value for the serving HS-DSCH cell as defined
in subclause 6A.4.1 and when single-stream restriction is not configured
either a type A or a type B CQI value and when single-stream restriction
is configured type B CQI value for the serving HS-DSCH cell as defined
in subclause 6A.2.2 depending on which type of CQI shall be reported as
defined below.

> If UE is not configured in Multiflow mode and Secondary\_Cell\_Active
> is not 0, the UE also derives a PCI value for the activated secondary
> serving HS-DSCH cell(s) as defined in subclause 6A.4 and when
> single-stream restriction is not configured either a type A or a type
> B CQI value and when single-stream restriction is configured type B
> CQI value for the secondary serving HS-DSCH cell as defined in
> subclause 6A.2.2 depending on which type of CQI shall be reported as
> defined below.
>
> If the UE is configured in the Multiflow mode,

\- the UE also derives a PCI value for the assisting serving and any
activated secondary serving and assisting secondary serving HS-DSCH
cells as defined in subclause 6A.4 if the UE is configured in MIMO mode
in that cell,

\- and when single-stream restriction is not configured, either type A
or type B CQI value, and when single-stream restriction is configured,
type B CQI value for the assisting serving and any activated secondary
serving and assisting secondary serving HS-DSCH cells as defined in
subclause 6A.2.2 depending on which type of CQI shall be reported.

> The PCI/CQI report(s) in each subframe are constructed from the
> composite PCI/CQI value(s) as specified in \[2\].

2\)

a\) For k = 0, the UE shall not transmit a composite PCI/CQI value.

b\) For k \> 0 when DTX\_DRX\_STATUS is not TRUE (see subclause 6A.1),
the UE shall transmit the composite PCI/CQI value(s) for the cells in
the PCI/CQI report containing the composite PCI/CQI value for the
serving HS-DSCH cell in each subframe that starts *m*×256 chips after
the start of the associated uplink DPCCH frame with *m* fulfilling

${\left( 5 \times \text{CFN} + \left\lceil m \times \text{256}\text{chip}/\text{7680}\text{chip} \right\rceil \right)\text{mod\ \{}k}^{'} = 0$
with $k^{'} = k/(2\text{ms})$, (x1)

where CFN denotes the connection frame number for the associated DPCH
and the set of five possible values of *m* is calculated as described in
subclause 7.7 in \[1\].

When single-stream restriction is not configured and the relation

$\left\lfloor \frac{5 \times \text{CFN} + \left\lceil m \times \text{256}\text{chip}/\text{7680}\text{chip} \right\rceil\ }{k^{'}} \right\rfloor\text{mod}\ M\text{\_cqi\ }\  < \ N\text{\_cqi\_typeA}$

holds, the UE shall report a type A CQI value. Otherwise the UE shall
report a type B CQI value.

c\) For k \> 0 when DTX\_DRX\_STATUS is TRUE (see subclause 6A.1), the
UE shall transmit the CQI value for the cells in the PCI/CQI report
containing the composite PCI/CQI value for the serving HS-DSCH cell as
specified in 6C.2 based on the CQI transmission pattern. The CQI
transmission pattern is the set of HS-DPCCH subframes whose HS-DPCCH
discontinuous transmission radio frame number CFN\_DRX and subframe
number S\_DRX, both defined in 6C.3, verify:

((5\*CFN\_DRX - UE\_DTX\_DRX\_Offset + S\_DRX ) mod k\') = 0, with
$k^{'} = k/(2\text{ms})$.

When single-stream restriction is not configured and the relation

$\left\lfloor \frac{5 \times \text{CFN\_DRX} - \text{UE\_DTX\_DRX\_Offset} + \text{S\_DRX}\ }{k^{'}} \right\rfloor\text{mod}\ M\text{\_cqi\ }\  < \ N\text{\_cqi\_typeA}$

holds, the UE shall report a type A CQI value. Otherwise the UE shall
report a type B CQI value.

d\) For k\>0, each PCI value derived in 1) shall be transmitted together
with the corresponding CQI value as a composite PCI/CQI value. It should
be noted that in case that 2560 is not an integer multiple of *M*\_cqi,
the sequence of type A and type B CQI reports might not always be
periodic due to CFN roll-over.

3\) The UE shall repeat the transmission of the CQI report containing
the composite PCI/CQI value for the serving HS-DSCH cell derived above
over the next *(N\_cqi\_transmit -- 1)* consecutive HS-DPCCH sub frames
in the slots respectively allocated to CQI as defined in \[1\]. The UE
does not support the case of $k^{'} < N_{\text{cqi}_{\text{transmit}}}$.

4a) If Secondary\_Cell\_Enabled is less than 4, the UE is not in
Multiflow mode, and if an additional PCI/CQI report is derived in 1),
the UE shall transmit this PCI/CQI report over the next
*N\_cqi\_transmit* consecutive HS-DPCCH sub frames immediately following
the transmission of the CQI report in 2) and 3). UE does not support the
case of $k^{'} < 2 \cdot N_{\text{cqi}_{\text{transmit}}}$.

4b) If Secondary\_Cell\_Enabled is 7 and Secondary\_Cell\_Active is 7
the UE shall:

\- Transmit the PCI/CQI report containing the PCI/CQI value of the 4^th^
secondary serving HS-DSCH cell simultaneously as the PCI/CQI report
containing the PCI/CQI value of the serving HS-DSCH cell.

\- Transmit the PCI/CQI report containing the PCI/CQI value of the 6^th^
secondary serving HS-DSCH cell simultaneously as the PCI/CQI report
containing the PCI/CQI value of the 2^nd^ secondary serving HS-DSCH cell

\- Transmit the PCI/CQI report containing the PCI/CQI value of the 5^th^
secondary serving HS-DSCH cell simultaneously as the PCI/CQI report
containing the PCI/CQI value of the 1^st^ secondary serving HS-DSCH cell

\- Transmit the PCI/CQI report containing the PCI/CQI value of the 7^th^
secondary serving HS-DSCH cell simultaneously as the PCI/CQI report
containing the PCI/CQI value of the 3^rd^ secondary serving HS-DSCH cell

#### 6A.1.2.3 Composite NTBP/PCI/CQI reporting procedure in case the UE is configured in MIMO mode with four transmit antennas

The following types of CQI reports have to be supported by the UE when
the UE is configured in MIMO mode with four transmit antennas:

Type A:

CQI reports that indicate the supported transport format(s) for the
number of simultaneously transmitted transport blocks that the UE
prefers according to the current channel conditions assuming that the
preferred precoding matrix as indicated by the PCI value signalled in
the same HS-DPCCH sub-frame would be applied at the Node-B.

Type B:

CQI reports that indicate the supported transport format for a single
transmitted transport block according to the current channel conditions
assuming that the preferred precoding vector as indicated by the PCI
value signalled in the same HS-DPCCH sub-frame would be applied at the
Node-B for the primary transport block and that no second, third, and
fourth transport blocks are transmitted.

With the exception of the provisions of subclause 6A.3, the following
shall apply when the UE is configured in MIMO mode with four transmit
antennas:

1\) The UE derives the NTBP, PCI value for the serving HS-DSCH cell as
defined in subclause 6A.4. 2 and either a type A or a type B CQI value
for the serving HS-DSCH cell depending on which type of CQI shall be
reported as defined below.

> If Secondary\_Cell\_Active is not 0, the UE also derives NTBP, PCI
> value for the activated secondary serving HS-DSCH cell(s) as defined
> in subclause 6A.4.1 and 6A.4.2 and either a type A or a type B CQI
> value for the secondary serving HS-DSCH cell depending on which type
> of CQI shall be reported as defined below.
>
> The NTBP/PCI/CQI report(s) in each subframe are constructed from the
> composite NTBP/PCI/CQI value(s) as specified in \[2\].

2\)

a\) For k = 0, the UE shall not transmit a composite NTBP/PCI/CQI value.

b\) For k \> 0 when DTX\_DRX\_STATUS is not TRUE (see subclause 6A.1),
the UE shall transmit the composite NTBP/PCI/CQI value(s) for the cells
in the NTBP/PCI/CQI report containing the composite NTBP/PCI/CQI value
for the serving HS-DSCH cell in each subframe that starts *m*×256 chips
after the start of the associated uplink DPCCH frame with *m* fulfilling

${\left( 5 \times \text{CFN} + \left\lceil m \times \text{256}\text{chip}/\text{7680}\text{chip} \right\rceil \right)\text{mod\ \{}k}^{'} = 0$
with $k^{'} = k/(2\text{ms})$, (x1)

where CFN denotes the connection frame number for the associated DPCH
and the set of five possible values of *m* is calculated as described in
subclause 7.7 in \[1\].

c\) For k \> 0 when DTX\_DRX\_STATUS is TRUE (see subclause 6A.1), the
UE shall transmit the CQI value for the cells in the NTBP/PCI/CQI report
containing the composite NTBP/PCI/CQI value for the serving HS-DSCH cell
as specified in 6C.2 based on the CQI transmission pattern. The CQI
transmission pattern is the set of HS-DPCCH subframes whose HS-DPCCH
discontinuous transmission radio frame number CFN\_DRX and subframe
number S\_DRX, both defined in 6C.3, verify:

((5\*CFN\_DRX - UE\_DTX\_DRX\_Offset + S\_DRX ) mod k\') = 0, with
$k^{'} = k/(2\text{ms})$.

d\) For k\>0, each NTBP/PCI value derived in 1) shall be transmitted
together with the corresponding CQI value as a composite PCI/CQI value.
It should be noted that in case that 2560 is not an integer multiple of
*M*\_cqi, the sequence of type A and type B CQI reports might not always
be periodic due to CFN roll-over.

3\) The UE shall repeat the transmission of the CQI report containing
the composite NTBP/PCI/CQI value for the serving HS-DSCH cell derived
above over the next *(N\_cqi\_transmit -- 1)* consecutive HS-DPCCH sub
frames in the slots respectively allocated to CQI as defined in \[1\].
The UE does not support the case of
$k^{'} < N_{\text{cqi}_{\text{transmit}}}$.

4a) If Secondary\_Cell\_Enabled is less than 2, and if an additional
NTBP/PCI/CQI report is derived in 1), the UE shall transmit this
NTBP/PCI/CQI report over the next *N\_cqi\_transmit* consecutive
HS-DPCCH sub frames immediately following the transmission of the CQI
report in 2) and 3). UE does not support the case of
$k^{'} < 2 \cdot N_{\text{cqi}_{\text{transmit}}}$.

> 4b) If Secondary\_Cell\_Enabled is 3 and Secondary\_Cell\_Active is 3
> the UE shall:
>
> \- Transmit the NTBP/PCI/CQI report containing the NTBP/PCI/CQI value
> of the 2^nd^ secondary serving HS-DSCH cell simultaneously as the
> NTBP/PCI/CQI report containing the NTBP/PCI/CQI value of the serving
> HS-DSCH cell.
>
> \- Transmit the NTBP/PCI/CQI report containing the NTBP/PCI/CQI value
> of the 3^rd^ secondary serving HS-DSCH cell simultaneously as the
> NTBP/PCI/CQI report containing the NTBP/PCI/CQI value of the 1^st^
> secondary serving HS-DSCH cell.
>
> The NTBP/PCI/CQI report is transmitted over *(N\_cqi\_transmit)*
> consecutive HS-DPCCH sub frames. The UE does not support the case of
> $k^{'} < 2 \cdot N_{\text{cqi}_{\text{transmit}}}$.

5\) The UE shall not transmit NTBP/PCI/CQI reports in other subframes
than those described in 2), 3) , 4a) and 4b).

### 6A.1.3 Node B procedure for transmitting the HS-DSCH and HS-SCCH

#### 6A.1.3.1 Node B procedure for transmitting the HS-DSCH and HS-SCCH in the CELL\_DCH state

When transmitting to a UE for which the HS-SCCH\_less\_mode=1, the Node
B shall use the following procedures:

\- The Node B can always transmit an HS-DSCH transport block using CRC
attachment method 1 and HS-SCCH type 1.

\- If HS-SCCH\_less\_Active is TRUE, the Node B may transmit an HS-DSCH
transport block using CRC attachment method 2 and HS-SCCH type 2
according to \[2\] provided that the size of the transport block belongs
to the set of transport block sizes configured for HS-SCCH less
operation by higher layers. In this case, a maximum of two
retransmissions may be used for each HS-DSCH transport block.

Otherwise,

\- The Node B should always transmit an HS-DSCH transport block using
CRC attachment method 1 and

\- HS-SCCH type 1 in a cell where the UE is not configured in MIMO mode
and not configured in MIMO mode with four transmit antennas, or

\- HS-SCCH type 3 in a cell where the UE is configured in MIMO mode, or

\- HS-SCCH type 4 in a cell where the UE is configured in MIMO mode with
four transmit antennas.

If Node B uses CRC attachment method 1 or CRC attachment method 2 for
the first transmission of a transport block, Node B shall use CRC
attachment method 1 or CRC attachment method 2 respectively for any
retransmission of the transport block.

When transmitting/retransmitting, in a cell where the UE is not
configured in MIMO mode and not configured in MIMO mode with four
transmit antennas, a transport block using CRC attachment method 1 or
retransmitting a transport block to a UE using CRC attachment method 2,
the Node B shall transmit the corresponding control information using
HS-SCCH type 1 or HS-SCCH type 2 respectively on one of the HS-SCCHs in
the UE's HS-SCCH set.

When transmitting/retransmitting, in a cell where the UE is configured
in MIMO mode, a transport block the Node B shall use CRC attachment
method 1 and transmit the corresponding control information using
HS-SCCH type 3 on one of the HS-SCCHs in the UE's HS-SCCH set.

When transmitting/retransmitting, in a cell where the UE is configured
in MIMO mode with four transmit antennas, the Node B shall use CRC
attachment method 1 and transmit the corresponding control information
using HS-SCCH type 4 on one of the HS-SCCHs in the UE's HS-SCCH set.

If the Simplified HS-SCCH type 1 operation is configured, once a UE has
reported a low CQI value over the HS-DPCCH (i.e., CQI values from 1 to
6), the UE may assume that a HS-SCCH Type 1 transmission carrying
control information corresponding to 1 code and QPSK would be
transmitted in the first available HS-SCCH subframe once four sub-frames
have passed after the end of the sub-frame where the HS-DPCCH was
transmitted.

\- The HS-SCCH orders described in \[2\] subclause 4.6C.2.2.5, which
upon their successful reception shall be acknowledged by the UE, can be
used to start and stop a transmission interval within which any
scheduled HS-SCCH Type 1 transmission will carry control information
corresponding to 1 code and QPSK. While the UE is within such a
transmission interval, once the UE has reported a CQI value over the
HS-DPCCH (i.e. any value), the UE may assume that a HS-SCCH Type 1
transmission carrying control information corresponding to 1 code and
QPSK would be transmitted in the first available HS-SCCH subframe once
four sub-frames have passed after the end of the sub-frame where the
HS-DPCCH was transmitted. When the network has transmitted a HS-SCCH
order for stopping the transmission interval created by the HS-SCCH
orders, a fall back to the CQI based triggering mechanism occurs.

#### 6A.1.3.2 Node B procedure for transmitting the HS-DSCH and HS-SCCH in the CELL\_FACH state

When transmitting to a UE the Node B shall use the following procedures:

\- The Node B shall always transmit an HS-DSCH transport block using CRC
attachment method 1 and HS-SCCH type 1.

\- When transmitting/retransmitting a transport block the Node B shall
transmit the corresponding control information using HS-SCCH type 1 on
one of the HS-SCCHs in the configured HS-SCCH set. When
transmitting/retransmitting a transport block with the BCCH specific
H-RNTI, the Node B shall use the first indexed HS-SCCH of the configured
HS-SCCH set.

\- When the NodeB transmits an HS-SCCH order as defined in \[2\]
subclause 4.6C.3.2.2, the NodeB shall start transmitting the HS-SCCH
associated with the HS-DSCH four sub-frames after the end of the
sub-frame where the HS-SCCH order was transmitted. The UE monitors the
reception of the HS-SCCH order as specified in \[5\].

#### 6A.1.3.3 Node B procedure for transmitting the HS-DSCH and HS-SCCH in the URA\_PCH or CELL\_PCH state

The timing relation of the PICH frame to the first associated HS-SCCH
subframe and its associated HS-DSCH subframe is described in 7.2A of
\[1\].

In CELL\_PCH state, when transmitting with a dedicated H-RNTI or BCCH
specific H-RNTI, the Node B shall use the following procedures:

\- The Node B may transmit HS-SCCH type 1 in any of the 5 HS-SCCH
subframes associated with the PICH frame (as defined in \[1\]), and the
corresponding HS-DSCH transport block using CRC attachment method 1 in
the associated HS-DSCH subframe. When transmitting with the BCCH
specific H-RNTI, the Node B shall use the first indexed HS-SCCH of the
configured HS-SCCH set.

\- The Node B may retransmit the HS-DSCH in any of the subsequent
sub-frames associated with the PICH (as defined in \[1\]). All
retransmissions shall be sent with HS-SCCH type 1.

\- The Node B may also transmit an HS-SCCH order, as defined in \[2\]
subclause 4.6C.3, in any of the 5 HS-SCCH subframes associated with the
PICH frame (as defined in \[1\]).

In CELL\_PCH state, when transmitting to a UE not configured with a
dedicated H-RNTI, or in URA\_PCH state, the Node B shall use the
following procedures:

\- The Node B shall not transmit an HS-SCCH.

\- The Node B shall transmit an HS-DSCH transport block in the HS-DSCH
subframe associated with the first associated HS-SCCH subframe, with the
following parameters:

\- QPSK modulation

\- HS-PDSCH channelisation code configured for HS-SCCH less paging
operation by higher layers

\- CRC attachment method 1 for the HS-DSCH

\- the size of the transport block belongs to the set of transport block
sizes configured for HS-SCCH less paging operation by higher layers.

\- The Node B shall retransmit the HS-DSCH transport block (Number of
PCCH transmissions-1) times in the next contiguous subframes without
transmitting HS-SCCH.

\- For the first, second, third, fourth and fifth transmissions, the
redundancy and constellation version of the HS-DSCH transport block are
0, 2, 5, 6, and 1, respectively.

6A.2 Channel quality indicator (CQI) definition
-----------------------------------------------

Any overlap between the 3-slot reference period (as defined in either
6A.2.1 or 6A.2.2 or 6A.2.2A) and a DRX period (as defined in subclause
6C.3) shall not prevent the UE transmitting a CQI report.

### 6A.2.1 CQI definition when the UE is not configured in MIMO mode and not configured in MIMO mode with four transmit antennas

This definition of CQI applies only when the UE is not configured in
MIMO mode and not configured in MIMO mode with four transmit antennas.

Based on an unrestricted observation interval, the UE shall report the
highest tabulated CQI value for which a single HS-DSCH sub-frame
formatted with the transport block size, number of HS-PDSCH codes and
modulation corresponding to the reported or lower CQI value could be
received with a transport block error probability not exceeding 0.1 in a
3-slot reference period ending 1 slot before the start of the first slot
in which the reported CQI value is transmitted. Depending on the UE
category as derived by higher layers in \[5\], either Table 7A, 7B, 7C,
7D, 7E, 7F or 7G should be used.

For the purpose of CQI reporting, the UE shall assume a total received
HS-PDSCH power of
$P_{\text{HSPDSCH}} = P_{\text{CPICH}} + \Gamma + \Delta$ in dB,

where the total received power is evenly distributed among the HS-PDSCH
codes of the reported CQI value, the measurement power offset is
signalled by higher layers and the reference power adjustment $\Delta$is
given by Table 7A, 7B, 7C, 7D, 7E, 7F or 7G depending on the UE
category.

Further, for the purpose of CQI reporting, the UE shall assume the
number of soft channel bits available in the virtual IR buffer (NIR),
and redundancy and constellation version parameter (XRV) as given by
Table 7A, 7B, 7C, 7D, 7E, 7F or 7G depending on the UE category
irrespective of the actual number of HARQ processes that are configured.
The indicated HSDPA category applies independent of whether the UE is
configured in Multiflow mode or not.

If higher layer signalling informs the UE that for the relevant radio
link (i.e. the radio link from the serving HS-DSCH cell in the case of a
CQI value for the serving HS-DSCH cell, or the radio link from a
secondary serving HS-DSCH cell in the case of a CQI value for a
secondary serving HS-DSCH cell) it may use a S-CPICH as a phase
reference and the P-CPICH is not a valid phase reference, is the
received power of the S-CPICH used by the UE, otherwise is the received
power of the P-CPICH. In the case of a CQI value for the serving HS-DSCH
cell, if closed loop transmit diversity is used for the radio link from
the serving HS-DSCH cell, denotes the power of the combined received
CPICH from both transmit antennas, determined as if error-free
transmitter weights had been applied to the CPICH, where those weights
are determined as described in subclause 7.2. If STTD is used, denotes
the combined CPICH power received from each transmit antenna and if no
transmit diversity is used denotes the power received from the non
diversity antenna.

For the purpose of CQI reporting the UE shall assume that all HS-PDSCH
channelisation codes it may receive from the relevant radio link are
under the same scrambling code as the Common Pilot Channel used to
determine .

### 6A.2.2 CQI definition when the UE is configured in MIMO mode

This definition of CQI applies only when the UE is configured in MIMO
mode.

Based on an unrestricted observation interval, the UE shall report the
highest tabulated CQI value(s) for which a single HS-DSCH sub-frame
formatted with the set of transport block size(s), number of HS-PDSCH
codes and set of modulation(s) corresponding to the reported CQI
value(s) could be received with individual transport block error
probabilities not exceeding 0.1 in a 3-slot reference period ending 1
slot before the start of the first slot in which the reported CQI
value(s) is/are transmitted if the preferred primary precoding vector as
indicated by the PCI value reported in the same HS-DPCCH sub-frame would
be applied at the Node B for the primary transport block and in case two
transport blocks are preferred the precoding vector orthogonal to the
preferred primary precoding vector would be applied for the secondary
transport block. When single-stream restriction is not configured and
depending on the UE category as derived by higher layers \[5\], either
Table 7H, 7I, 7Ia or 7Ib shall be used for dual transport block type A
CQI reports, and either Table 7C, 7D, 7F or 7G shall be used for single
transport block type A or type B CQI reports.

Type A CQI reports are constructed using a CQI value that is computed
according to

$\text{CQI\ } = \left\{ \begin{matrix}
\text{15\ x\ CQI}_{1} + \ \text{CQI}_{2} + \text{31}\ \text{when\ 2\ transport\ blocks\ are\ preferred\ by\ the\ UE} \\
\text{CQI}_{S}\ \text{when\ 1\ transport\ block\ is\ preferred\ by\ the\ UE} \\
\end{matrix} \right.\ $,

where CQI~1~ indicates the supported transport format according to Table
7H, 7I, 7Ia or 7Ib for the transport block that could be received with
the specified block error probability if it was transmitted with the
preferred primary precoding vector and CQI~2~ indicates the supported
transport format according to Table 7H, 7I, 7Ia or 7Ib for the transport
block that could be received with the specified block error probability
if it was transmitted with the precoding vector orthogonal to the
preferred primary precoding vector. CQI~S~ indicates the supported
transport format according to Table 7C, 7D, 7F or 7G for the transport
block that could be received with the specified block error probability
if it was transmitted with the preferred primary precoding vector.

When single-stream restriction is not configured type B CQI reports are
constructed using the CQI value of the supported transport format
according to Table 7C, 7D, 7F or 7G for the transport block that could
be received with the specified block error probability if it was
transmitted with the preferred primary precoding vector.

When single-stream restriction is configured type B CQI reports are
constructed using the CQI value of the supported transport format
according to Table 7A, 7B, 7C, 7D, 7F or 7G for the transport block that
could be received with the specified block error probability if it was
transmitted with the preferred primary precoding vector.

For the purpose of CQI reporting, the UE shall assume a total transmit
power of HS-PDSCH

$P_{\text{HSPDSCH}} = P_{\text{CPICH}} + \Gamma$ in dB,

where the total transmit power is assumed to be evenly distributed among
the HS-PDSCH codes corresponding to the reported CQI value, and the
measurement power offset is signaled by higher layers. denotes the
combined transmit power of the set of CPICH(s) used for MIMO operation
of HS-DSCH.

When single-stream restriction is not configured and if a CQI for a
single transport block is reported, the parameter $\Delta$ that is given
by Table 7C, 7D, 7F or 7G depending on the UE category and configuration
indicates a reference power adjustment for the Node B transmit power on
the indicated HS-PDSCH(s). If a CQI for two transport blocks is
reported, the parameter $\Delta$ that is given by Table 7H, 7I, 7Ia or
7Ib depending on the UE category and configuration indicates by how much
the equivalent AWGN symbol SINR for a specific transport block would be
different from the one required to meet the predicted BLER performance.

When single-stream restriction is configured, the parameter $\Delta$
that is given by Table 7A, 7B, 7C, 7D, 7F or 7G depending on the UE
category and configuration indicates a reference power adjustment for
the Node B transmit power on the indicated HS-PDSCH(s).

When deriving the CQI value, the UE assumes that the Node B would be
using a uniform power allocation across the number of HS-PDSCH codes
corresponding to the CQI value to be reported. In case the UE reports a
CQI for two transport blocks, it is assumed by the UE that the Node B
uses an equal power per HS-PDSCH code for both of the two transport
blocks.

When the Node B schedules the UE with two transport blocks, if the Node
B does not transmit with equal power per used HS-PDSCH code or use
different power per code than indicated by the measurement power offset
, it should not assume that the reported transport block sizes can be
received with the specified block error probabilities or that
transmission of two transport blocks is preferred by the UE.

Further, for the purpose of CQI reporting, the UE shall assume the
number of soft channel bits available in the virtual IR buffer (NIR),
and redundancy and constellation version parameter (Xrv, Xrvpb, or
Xrvsb) as given by Table 7A, 7B, 7C, 7D, 7F, 7G, 7H, 7I, 7Ia or 7Ib
depending on the UE category and on the CQI report type irrespective of
the actual number of HARQ processes that are configured.

For the purpose of CQI reporting the UE shall assume that all HS-PDSCH
channelisation codes it may receive are under the same scrambling code
as the set of CPICH(s) used to determine.

### 6A.2.2A CQI definition when the UE is configured in MIMO mode with four transmit antennas

This definition of CQI applies only when the UE is configured in MIMO
mode with four transmit antennas.

Based on an unrestricted observation interval, the UE shall report the
highest tabulated CQI value(s) for which a single HS-DSCH sub-frame
formatted with the set of transport block size(s), number of HS-PDSCH
codes and set of modulation(s) corresponding to the reported CQI
value(s) could be received with individual transport block error
probabilities not exceeding 0.1 in a 3-slot reference period ending 1
slot before the start of the first slot in which the reported CQI
value(s) is/are transmitted if the preferred precoding matrix as
indicated by the PCI value reported in the same HS-DPCCH sub-frame that
would be applied at the Node B on transport blocks as indicated by the
UE. Either Table 7H, 7I, 7Ia or 7Ib shall be used for two, three or four
transport block type A CQI reports, and either Table 7C, 7D, 7F or 7G
shall be used for single transport block type A or type B CQI reports.

Type A CQI reports are constructed using a CQI value that is computed
according to

When the number of transport blocks preferred by the UE is equal to
four, CQI~1~ indicates the supported transport format according to Table
7H, 7I, 7Ia or 7Ib for the primary and fourth transport blocks that
could be received with the specified block error probability if it was
transmitted with the preferred precoding matrix and CQI~2~ indicates the
supported transport format according to Table 7H, 7I, 7Ia or 7Ib for the
second and third transport blocks that could be received with the
specified block error probability if it was transmitted with the
preferred precoding matrix.

When the number of transport blocks preferred by the UE is equal to
three, CQI~1~ indicates the supported transport format according to
Table 7H, 7I, 7Ia or 7Ib for the primary transport block that could be
received with the specified block error probability if it was
transmitted with the preferred precoding matrix and CQI~2~ indicates the
supported transport format according to Table 7H, 7I, 7Ia or 7Ib for the
second and third transport blocks that could be received with the
specified block error probability if it was transmitted with the
preferred precoding matrix.

When the number of transport blocks preferred by the UE is equal to two,
CQI~1~ indicates the supported transport format according to Table 7H,
7I, 7Ia or 7Ib for the primary transport block that could be received
with the specified block error probability if it was transmitted with
the preferred precoding matrix and CQI~2~ indicates the supported
transport format according to Table 7H, 7I, 7Ia or 7Ib for the second
transport block that could be received with the specified block error
probability if it was transmitted with the preferred precoding matrix.

When the number of transport blocks preferred by the UE is equal to one,
CQI~S~ indicates the supported transport format according to Table 7C,
7D, 7F or 7G for the transport block that could be received with the
specified block error probability if it was transmitted with the
preferred precoding vector.

Type B CQI reports are constructed using the CQI value of the supported
transport format according to Table 7C, 7D, 7F or 7G for the transport
block that could be received with the specified block error probability
if it was transmitted with the preferred precoding vector.

When D-CPICH(s) are not activated for data demodulation by Node B, for
the purpose of CQI reporting, the UE shall assume a total transmit power
of HS-PDSCH

$P_{\text{HSPDSCH}} = P_{\text{CPICH}} + \Gamma$ in dB,

where the total transmit power is assumed to be evenly distributed among
the HS-PDSCH codes corresponding to the reported CQI value, and the
measurement power offset is signaled by higher layers. denotes the
combined transmit power of the set of primary and three secondary CPICHs
used for MIMO operation of HS-DSCH.

When D-CPICH(s) are activated for data demodulation by Node B, for the
purpose of CQI reporting, the UE shall assume a total transmit power of
HS-PDSCH

$P_{\text{HSPDSCH}} = P_{\text{CPICH}} + \Gamma 1$ in dB,

where the total transmit power is assumed to be evenly distributed among
the HS-PDSCH codes corresponding to the reported CQI value, and the
measurement power offset 1 are signaled by higher layers. denotes the
combined transmit power of the set of primary and three secondary CPICHs
used for MIMO operation of HS-DSCH.

If a CQI for a single transport block is reported, the parameter
$\Delta$ that is given by Table 7C, 7D, 7F or 7G depending on the UE
category and configuration indicates a reference power adjustment for
the Node B transmit power on the indicated HS-PDSCH(s). If a CQI for two
or three or four transport blocks are reported, the parameter $\Delta$
that is given by Table 7H, 7I, 7Ia or 7Ib depending on the UE category
and configuration indicates by how much the equivalent AWGN symbol SINR
for a specific transport block would be different from the one required
to meet the predicted BLER performance.

When deriving the CQI value, the UE assumes that the Node B would be
using a uniform power allocation across the number of HS-PDSCH codes
corresponding to the CQI value to be reported. In case the UE reports a
CQI for more than one transport block, it is assumed by the UE that the
Node B uses an equal power per HS-PDSCH code for all the transport
blocks.

When the Node B schedules the UE with more than one transport block, if
the Node B does not transmit each transport block with equal power per
used HS-PDSCH code or use different power per code than indicated by the
measurement power offset , it should not assume that the reported
transport block sizes can be received with the specified block error
probabilities or that transmission of more than one transport block is
preferred by the UE.

Further, for the purpose of CQI reporting, the UE shall assume the
number of soft channel bits available in the virtual IR buffer (NIR),
and redundancy and constellation version parameter (Xrv, Xrvpb, or
Xrvsb) as given by Table 7A, 7B, 7C, 7D, 7F, 7G, 7H, 7I, 7Ia or 7Ib
depending on the UE category and on the CQI report type irrespective of
the actual number of HARQ processes that are configured.

For the purpose of CQI reporting the UE shall assume that all HS-PDSCH
channelisation codes it may receive are under the same scrambling code
as the set of CPICH(s) used to determine.

6A.3 Operation during compressed mode on the associated DPCH or F-DPCH
----------------------------------------------------------------------

During compressed mode on the associated DPCH or F-DPCH, and the
Secondary Cell Active is 0, or the Secondary Cell Active is not 0 and
the compressed mode is applied to the serving HS-DSCH cell and all the
secondary serving HS-DSCH cells, the following applies for the UE for
transmission of HS-DPCCH and reception of HS-SCCH and HS-PDSCH:

\- The UE shall neglect a HS-SCCH or HS-PDSCH transmission, if a part of
the HS-SCCH or a part of the corresponding HS-PDSCH overlaps with a
downlink transmission gap on the associated DPCH or F-DPCH. In this
case, neither ACK, nor NACK shall be transmitted by the UE to respond to
the corresponding downlink transmission.

\- If a part of a HS-DPCCH slot allocated to HARQ-ACK overlaps with an
uplink transmission gap on the associated DPCH, the UE shall use DTX on
the HS-DPCCH in that HS-DPCCH slot.

\- If in a HS-DPCCH sub-frame a part of a slot allocated for CQI
information overlaps with an uplink transmission gap on the associated
DPCH, the UE shall not transmit that CQI or composite PCI/CQI
information in that sub-frame (if HS-DPCCH slot format 0 is used) or in
that slot (if HS-DPCCH slot format 1 is used).

\- If a CQI report or a composite PCI/CQI report is scheduled in the
current CQI field according to subclause 6A.1.2.1 paragraph (2) or
subclause 6A.1.2.2 paragraph (2), and the corresponding 3-slot reference
period (as defined in subclause 6A.2.1 or subclause 6A.2.2) wholly or
partly overlaps a downlink transmission gap, then the UE shall use DTX
in the current CQI field and in the CQI fields in the next
(*N\_cqi\_transmit*--1) subframes.

During compressed mode, when Secondary\_Cell\_Active is not 0 and the
compressed mode is not applied to all the active cells, the following
applies for the UE for transmission of HS-DPCCH and reception of HS-SCCH
and HS-PDSCH on the cell(s) in which the compressed mode is applied:

\- The UE shall neglect a HS-SCCH or HS-PDSCH transmission on a cell, if
a part of the HS-SCCH or a part of the corresponding HS-PDSCH overlaps
with a downlink transmission gap on that cell. In this case, neither
ACK, nor NACK shall be transmitted by the UE to respond to the
corresponding downlink transmission.

\- If a CQI report or a composite PCI/CQI report for a cell is scheduled
in the current CQI field according to subclause 6A.1.2.1 paragraph (2)
or subclause 6A.1.2.2 paragraph (2), and the corresponding 3-slot
reference period (as defined in subclause 6A.2.1 or subclause 6A.2.2)
wholly or partly overlaps a downlink transmission gap on that cell, then
the UE shall use DTX in the current CQI field and in the CQI fields in
the next (*N\_cqi\_transmit*--1) subframes if using DTX in the CQI field
is possible. In the case that using DTX in the CQI field is not possible
due to the need to transmit a CQI or a composite PCI/CQI report of
another cell not experiencing a compressed mode gap, the UE shall
transmit a CQI or a composite PCI/CQI report based on measurements prior
to the start of the compressed mode gap for the cell experiencing the
compressed mode gap.

During compressed mode, when the UE is configured in Multiflow mode,

\- For the assisting serving HS-DSCH cell: The UE shall follow the same
compressed mode rules that are defined for the serving HS-DSCH cell.

\- For the assisting secondary serving cell, if present: The UE shall
follow the same compressed mode rules that are defined for the secondary
serving HS-DSCH cell.

6A.4 Precoding control indication (PCI) definition
--------------------------------------------------

### 6A.4.1 PCI definition when the UE is configured in MIMO mode

The UE uses the CPICH(s) transmitted from antenna 1 and antenna 2 to
calculate the preferred precoding vectors to be applied at Node B to
maximise the aggregate transport block size that could be supported
under current channel conditions. No matter whether one or two transport
blocks are preferred, it is sufficient to signal from the UE to the Node
B only the preferred primary precoding vector
$\left( w_{1}^{\text{pref}},w_{2}^{\text{pref}} \right)$, since the
optional secondary precoding vector will be a unique function of the
primary one. When single-stream restriction is not configured the
information on whether one or two transport blocks are preferred is part
of the CQI reporting as defined in subclause 6A.2.2. Since the first
precoding weight $w_{1}^{\text{pref}}$of the preferred primary precoding
vector $\left( w_{1}^{\text{pref}},w_{2}^{\text{pref}} \right)$ is
constant, it is sufficient to determine the precoding weight for antenna
2. In each TTI during which the UE derives a composite PCI/CQI report,
the UE shall calculate the optimum precoding weight
$w_{2}^{\text{pref}}$for antenna 2.

If the UE is not configured with precoding weight set restriction by the
higher layers, the optimum precoding weight $w_{2}^{\text{pref}}$ for
antenna 2 is taken from the set:

$w_{2}^{\text{pref}} \in \begin{Bmatrix}
\frac{1 + j}{2} & \frac{1 - j}{2} & \frac{- 1 + j}{2} & \frac{- 1 - j}{2} \\
\end{Bmatrix}$.

If the UE is configured with precoding weight set restriction by the
higher layers, the optimum precoding vector weight $w_{2}^{\text{pref}}$
for antenna 2 is taken from the set as defined in table 7J0.

Table 7J0 : Selection of the precoding weight set when the precoding
weight set restriction is configured by higher layers

  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Number of Transport Blocks preferred in the composite PCI/CQI report**     **Precoding weight set from which the optimum precoding weight** $w_{2}^{\text{pref}}$ **for antenna 2 is taken.**

  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The precoding weight $w_{2}^{\text{pref}}$is mapped to PCI values as
defined in table 7J.

### 6A.4.2 PCI definition when the UE is configured in MIMO mode with four transmit antennas

This section applies only when the UE is configured in MIMO mode with
four transmit antennas.

The UE uses the CPICHs transmitted from antenna 1, antenna 2, antennas 3
and antenna 4 to calculate the preferred precoding matrix to be applied
at Node B to maximise the aggregate transport block sizes that could be
supported under current channel conditions.

The preferred precoding information PCI (*pci~0~*, *pci~1~*, *pci~2~*,
*pci~3~*) is defined as the precoding weight information in subclause
4.6D.2.7 of \[2\] with the following PCI mapping to table 14B.7:

*pci~0~*, *pci~1~*, *pci~2~*, *pci~3~ = x~pwibp,1~*, *x~pwibp,2~*,
*x~pwibp,3~*, *x~pwibp,4~*.

The number of transport blocks corresnponding corresponding to table
14B.7 used in the PCI derivation corresponds to the number of transport
blocks preferred (NTBP) reported in the composite NTBP/PCI/CQI report
carrying the corresponding NTBP.

6B E-DCH related procedures
===========================

The following physical layer parameters are signalled to the UE from
higher layers:

1\) E-HICH set to be monitored for each uplink frequency for which E-DCH
is configured

2\) E-RGCH set to be monitored for each uplink frequency for which E-DCH
is configured

If the UE is configured with multiple uplink frequencies, then the
Secondary\_EDCH\_Cell\_Enabled is 1, otherwise
Secondary\_EDCH\_Cell\_Enabled is 0 and Secondary\_EDCH\_Cell\_Active is
0.

The Secondary\_EDCH\_Cell\_Active shall be set according to the
following rules:

\- Secondary\_EDCH\_Cell\_Active is set to 0 when
Secondary\_EDCH\_Cell\_Enabled is 0 or Secondary\_Cell\_Active is 0 (as
described in subclause 6A.1).

\- Secondary\_EDCH\_Cell\_Active shall remain set to 0, when
Secondary\_EDCH\_Cell\_Enabled is changed from 0 to 1.

\- Secondary\_EDCH\_Cell\_Active shall be set to 0 or 1, upon the
reception of HS-SCCH orders to deactivate or activate the secondary
uplink carrier respectively as specified in \[2\] when
Secondary\_EDCH\_Cell\_Enabled is 1 and Secondary\_Cell\_Active is not 0
(as described in subclause 6A.1) and the 1^st^ secondary serving HS-DSCH
cell is activated.

\- Secondary\_EDCH\_Cell\_Active shall be set to 0 or 1, upon the
reception of HS-SCCH orders to deactivate or activate both the secondary
uplink carrier and the 1^st^ secondary serving HS-DSCH cell as specified
in \[2\] when Secondary\_EDCH\_Cell\_Enabled is 1 (as described in
subclause 6A.1).

\- Secondary\_EDCH\_Cell\_Active can be set to 0 by higher layers (as
described in \[5\]).

Secondary\_EDCH\_Cell\_Active shall be set to 1 while
Secondary\_EDCH\_Cell\_Enabled is 1, Secondary\_Cell\_Active is not
0,1^st^ secondary serving HS-DSCH cell is activated, and the secondary
uplink frequency is activated, otherwise Secondary\_EDCH\_Cell\_Active
shall be set to 0. If the Secondary\_EDCH\_Cell\_Active is already equal
to 1 when the UE receives an HS-SCCH order for activation of the
secondary uplink frequency as specified in \[2\], then the UE shall not
change the status of Secondary\_EDCH\_Cell\_Active regarding the
contents of the order, but shall transmit the HARQ-ACK acknowledging the
HS-SCCH order.

HS-SCCH ordered deactivation or activation of the secondary uplink
frequency is applied by the UE at the same point in time as in the case
of HS-SCCH ordered deactivation and activation of the secondary serving
HS-DSCH cell for a UE configured with multiple uplink frequencies (see
subclause 6A.1).

If higher layers set READY\_FOR\_COMMON\_ERGCH to TRUE (as described in
\[5\]) then Common\_RGCH\_Enabled is TRUE. Otherwise,
Common\_RGCH\_Enabled is FALSE.

If higher layers configure concurrent deployment of 2ms and 10ms TTI in
a cell (as described in \[5\]) then Concurrent\_TTI\_Deployment\_Enabled
is TRUE. Otherwise, Concurrent\_TTI\_Deployment\_Enabled is FALSE.

If higher layers set READY\_FOR\_FALLBACK\_R99\_PRACH to TRUE (as
described in \[5\]) then Fallback\_R99\_Enabled is TRUE. Otherwise,
Fallback\_R99\_Enabled is FALSE.

If NT-HS-DPCCH\_Enabled is TRUE, the UE shall inform higher layers about
the reception of an HS-SCCH order and the order type.

6B.1 ACK/NACK detection
-----------------------

For each activated uplink frequency, the physical layer in the UE shall
detect ACK or NACK within the E-HICH set that is monitored by the UE in
the subframes where ACK/NACK is transmitted by the UTRAN and deliver the
ACK/NACK to the higher layers as follows:

\- When a UE is not in soft handover, an ACK shall be delivered to the
higher layers if a reliable ACK is detected by the physical layer in the
UE, else a NACK shall be delivered to the higher layers.

\- When a UE is in soft handover, multiple ACK/NACKs may be received in
an E-DCH TTI from different cells in the active set. In some cases, the
UE has the knowledge that some of the transmitted ACK/NACKs are the
same. This is the case when the radio links are in the same radio link
set. For these cases, ACK/NACKs from the same radio link set shall be
soft combined into one ACK/NACK information and delivered to higher
layers. If a radio link set contains only one radio link, the detection
shall be done as specified above for the case where the UE is not in
soft handover. For each radio link set containing multiple radio links,
an ACK shall be delivered to the higher layers if a reliable ACK is
detected by the physical layer in the UE after soft combining, else a
NACK shall be delivered to the higher layers.

6B.2 Relative grants detection
------------------------------

In CELL\_DCH state, for each activated uplink frequency, the physical
layer in the UE shall detect relative grants within the E-RGCH set that
is monitored by the UE and deliver the relative grants to the higher
layers as follows:

\- When a UE is not in soft handover, an UP shall be delivered to the
higher layers if a reliable UP is detected by the physical layer in the
UE, else a DOWN shall be delivered to the higher layers if a reliable
DOWN is detected by the UE, else a HOLD shall be delivered to the higher
layers.

\- When a UE is in soft handover, multiple relative grants may be
received in an E-DCH TTI from different cells in the E-DCH active set.
The UE shall handle the E-RGCH received from these cells as follows:

\- If the E-DCH serving radio link set contains only one radio link, the
detection shall be done as specified above for the case where the UE is
not in soft handover. If the E-DCH serving radio link set contains more
than one radio link, the relative grants from the E-DCH serving radio
link set are the same and shall be soft combined into one single
relative grant information; an UP shall be delivered to the higher
layers if a reliable UP is detected by the physical layer in the UE
after soft combining, else a DOWN shall be delivered to the higher
layers if a reliable DOWN is detected by the UE after soft combining,
else a HOLD shall be delivered to the higher layers.

\- Furthermore, for each relative grant received from a radio link which
does not belong to the E-DCH serving radio link set, a DOWN shall be
delivered to the higher layers if a reliable DOWN is detected by the UE,
else a HOLD shall be delivered to the higher layers. The UE shall not
soft combine relative grants received from radio links which do not
belong to the E-DCH serving radio link set.

In CELL\_FACH state, if Common\_RGCH\_Enabled is TRUE, the physical
layer in the UE shall detect relative grants within the E-RGCH set that
is monitored by the UE and deliver the relative grants to the higher
layers as follows:

\- Multiple relative grants may be received in an E-DCH TTI from
different cells that do not belong to the E-DCH serving radio link set.
For each relative grant received from a cell, a DOWN shall be delivered
to the higher layers if a reliable DOWN is detected by the physical
layer in the UE, else a HOLD shall be delivered to the higher layers.
The UE shall not soft combine relative grants received from any of the
cells.

6B.2A Absolute Grant Detection when the UE is configured with Implicit Grant Handling
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In CELL\_DCH state, when Implicit Grant Handling is configured, the UE
shall determine the presence of an E-AGCH transmission. If the presence
of the E-AGCH transmission in an E-AGCH sub-frame is detected, then the
Serving Grant Update procedure as described in subclause 11.8.1.3.1 of
\[9\] shall be applied. Otherwise, the UE shall assume that it has not
received an E-AGCH transmission in that TTI.

6B.3 E-DCH control timing
-------------------------

In subclauses 6B.3.1 and 6B.3.2 the word \"first\" refers to the
earliest point in time.

### 6B.3.0 UE procedure for switching the E-DCH TTI length due to an HS-SCCH order

When Enhanced TTI switching is configured, upon successfully receiving
an HS-SCCH order that depending on the UE's configuration indicates
single cell E-DCH TTI switching (i.e. from 2ms E-DCH TTI to 10ms E-DCH
TTI or vice versa) or dual cell E-DCH TTI switching (see Table 14B.3B in
\[2\]), the UE shall be able to start transmitting E-DCH data using the
new E-DCH TTI length according to the activation time configured by
higher layers and the time taken for E-DCH TTI reconfiguration. The
activation time is measured from the beginning of the first E-DCH radio
frame after the end of the HS-SCCH sub-frame containing the order. The
UE E-DCH TTI reconfiguration process begins after the activation time
and lasts for 20 ms, after which the UE shall be able to start
transmitting E-DCH data using the new E-DCH TTI length.

### 6B.3.1 10 ms E-DCH TTI

For each cell in the E-DCH active set, the UE shall associate the
control data received in the E-HICH frame associated with SFN *i* to the
data transmitted in the E‑DPDCH frame associated with SFN *i-3*.

For each cell which belongs to the serving E-DCH radio link set, the UE
shall first take into account E-DCH control data received in the E-RGCH
frame associated with SFN *i* in the higher layer procedures which
correspond to E-DCH transmission in the E-DPDCH frame associated with
SFN *i+1*.

For each cell which does not belong to the serving E-DCH radio link set
the UE shall first take into account E-DCH control data received in the
E-RGCH frame associated with SFN *i* in the higher layer procedures
which correspond to E-DCH transmission in the E-DPDCH frame associated
with SFN *i+1+s* where:

The UE shall first take into account E-DCH control data received in the
E-AGCH frame associated with SFN *i* in the higher layer procedures
which correspond to E-DCH transmission in the E-DPDCH frame associated
with SFN *i+1+s* where:

When a downlink F-DPCH is configured,
$\tau_{\text{DPCH},n} = \tau_{F - \text{DPCH},n}$.

### 6B.3.2 2 ms E-DCH TTI

For each cell in the E-DCH active set, the UE shall associate the E-DCH
control data received in sub-frame *j* of the E-HICH frame associated
with SFN *i* to sub-frame *t* of the E‑DPDCH frame associated with
SFN *i-s* where:

$s = 1 - \left\lfloor j/3 \right\rfloor$, and
$t = \left( j + 2 \right)\text{mod}5$

For each cell which belongs to the serving E-DCH radio link set, the UE
shall first take into account E-DCH control data received in sub-frame
*j* of the E-RGCH frame associated with SFN *i* in the higher layer
procedures which correspond to E-DCH transmission in sub-frame *j* of
the E-DPDCH frame associated with SFN *i+1*.

For each cell which does not belong to the serving E-DCH radio link set
the UE shall first take into account E-DCH control data received in the
E-RGCH frame associated with SFN *i* in the higher layer procedures
which correspond to E-DCH transmission in sub-frame *t* of the E-DPDCH
frame associated with SFN *i+1+s* where:

$s = \left\lfloor \frac{\left\lceil \frac{\text{160} - \left( \tau_{\text{DPCH},n}/\text{256} \right)}{\text{30}} \right\rceil}{5} \right\rfloor$,
and
$t = \left\lceil \frac{\text{160} - \left( \tau_{\text{DPCH},n}/\text{256} \right) - \text{150}s}{\text{30}} \right\rceil$

The UE shall first take into account E-DCH control data received in
sub-frame *j* of the E-AGCH frame associated with SFN *i* in the higher
layer procedures which correspond to E-DCH transmission in sub-frame *t*
of the E-DPDCH frame associated with SFN *i+s* where:

$s = \left\lfloor \frac{\left\lceil \frac{\text{30}j + \text{100} - \left( \tau_{\text{DPCH},n}/\text{256} \right)}{\text{30}} \right\rceil}{5} \right\rfloor$,
and
$t = \left\lceil \frac{\text{30}j + \text{100} - \left( \tau_{\text{DPCH},n}/\text{256} \right) - \text{150}s}{\text{30}} \right\rceil$

The same relationship applies for E-ROCH to S-E-DPDCH timing
relationship as is defined above for the E-AGCH to E-DPDCH timing
relationship.

When a downlink F-DPCH is configured,
$\tau_{\text{DPCH},n} = \tau_{F - \text{DPCH},n}$.

6B.4 Operation during compressed mode
-------------------------------------

### 6B.4.1 Uplink compressed mode

When E‑DCH TTI length is 2 ms, the UE shall not transmit E‑DCH data in a
TTI which fully or partly overlaps with an uplink transmission gap.

Handling of uplink compressed mode when the E-DCH TTI is 10msec is
described in \[2\].

### 6B.4.2 Downlink compressed mode

The following applies for the UE for reception of E-HICH, E-RGCH and
E-AGCH, during compressed mode on the DPCH or F-DPCH:

> \- A UE shall decode E-HICH, E-RGCH, E-ROCH or E-AGCH transmissions to
> the UE using all the slots which do not overlap a downlink
> transmission gap.
>
> \- The UE may discard E-HICH, E-RGCH, E-ROCH or E-AGCH slots which
> overlap a downlink transmission gap.

6C Discontinuous transmission and reception procedures
======================================================

Whether discontinuous uplink DPCCH transmission operation or
discontinuous downlink reception operation are applied is determined by
the settings of UL\_DTX\_Active and DL\_DRX\_Active as follows:

UL\_DTX\_Active shall be set to TRUE while UE\_DTX\_DRX\_Enabled is TRUE
and discontinuous uplink DPCCH transmission is activated. Otherwise,
UL\_DTX\_Active shall be set to FALSE.

Discontinuous uplink DPCCH transmission shall be activated at the time
when UE\_DTX\_DRX\_Enabled is set to TRUE, and may be further
deactivated or activated by layer 1 HS-SCCH orders (see subclause 6C.4).

DL\_DRX\_Active shall be set to TRUE while UE\_DTX\_DRX\_Enabled is TRUE
and UL\_DTX\_Active is TRUE and discontinuous downlink reception is
activated. Otherwise, DL\_DRX\_Active shall be set to FALSE.

Discontinuous downlink reception shall be activated at the time when
UE\_DTX\_DRX\_Enabled is set to TRUE, and may be further deactivated or
activated by layer 1 HS-SCCH orders (see subclause 6C.4).

The higher layers define the discontinuous transmission and reception
procedures using the following parameters:

For discontinuous UL DPCCH transmission:

**CQI\_DTX\_TIMER**: Specifies the number of subframes during which the
CQI reports have higher priority than the DTX pattern. This is the
initial value of CQI nominal reporting timer.

**UE\_DTX\_cycle\_1**: Uplink DPCCH burst pattern length in subframes.

**UE\_DTX\_cycle\_2**: Uplink DPCCH burst pattern length in subframes.

**Inactivity\_Threshold\_for\_UE\_DTX\_cycle\_2**: Defines a number of
consecutive E-DCH TTIs without an E-DCH transmission, after which the UE
shall immediately move from UE\_DTX\_cycle\_1 to using
UE\_DTX\_cycle\_2.

**UE\_DPCCH\_burst\_1**: Determines the Uplink DPCCH burst length in
subframes, when UE\_DTX\_cycle\_1 is applied.

**UE\_DPCCH\_burst\_2**: Determines the Uplink DPCCH burst length in
subframes, when UE\_DTX\_cycle\_2 is applied.

**UE\_DTX\_long\_preamble\_length**: Determines in slots the length of
the preamble associated with the UE\_DTX\_cycle\_2.

For both discontinuous UL DPCCH transmission and discontinuous downlink
reception:

**UE\_DTX\_DRX Offset**: Uplink DPCCH burst pattern and HS-SCCH
reception pattern offset in subframes.

**Enabling\_Delay**: defined in \[5\], ensures that the uplink DPCCH,
the downlink F-DPCH and, if configured, the downlink F-TPICH are
transmitted continuously for Enabling\_Delay radio frames after
DTX\_DRX\_STATUS is set to TRUE or ensures that, with DTX\_DRX\_STATUS
set to TRUE[,]{.underline} the uplink DPCCH on the secondary uplink
frequency is transmitted continuously for Enabling\_Delay radio frames
after application of secondary uplink frequency activation.

For discontinuous downlink reception:

**UE\_DRX cycle**: HS-SCCH reception pattern length in subframes.

**Inactivity\_Threshold\_for\_UE\_DRX\_cycle**: Defines the number of
subframes after an HS-SCCH reception or after the first slot of an
HS-PDSCH reception (as defined in 6C.3) during which the UE is required
to monitor the HS-SCCHs in the UE's HS-SCCH set continuously with the
exceptions of N\_acknack\_transmit\>1 or N\_acknack\_transmit\_2 \>1
when the UE is configured in multiflow mode or InterTTI\>1.

**UE\_DRX\_Grant\_Monitoring**: A Boolean which determines whether the
UE is required to monitor the E-AGCH and E-ROCH transmissions from the
serving E-DCH cell and the E-RGCH from cells in the serving E-DCH radio
link set when the conditions in subclause 6C.3 are met.

When DRX enhancements is configured, the following definitions also
apply:

**UE\_DRX\_cycle\_2**: HS-SCCH reception pattern length in subframes.

**Inactivity\_Threshold\_for\_UE\_DRX\_cycle\_2**: Defines a number of
consecutive subframes without an HS-SCCH reception or after the first
slot of an HS-PDSCH reception (as defined in 6C.3), after which the UE
shall immediately move from UE\_DRX\_cycle to using UE\_DRX\_cycle\_2.

6C.0 Discontinuous transmission/reception of DCH
------------------------------------------------

When DL\_DCH\_FET\_Config is configured by higher layers,
DL\_DPCH\_DYN\_DRX and UL\_DPCH\_DYN\_DTX control DTX and DRX operations
for DPCH transmission and reception. UE shall DRX DL DPDCH if
DL\_DPCH\_DYN\_DRX is TRUE. UE shall DTX UL DPDCH if UL\_DPCH\_DYN\_DTX
is TRUE.

In each slot, the values of the Boolean flags DL\_DPCH\_DYN\_DRX and
UL\_DPCH\_DYN\_DTX are determined in Subclause 6C.0.1 and 6C.0.2.

### 6C.0.1 DL\_DPCH\_DYN\_DRX and UL\_DPCH\_DYN\_DTX 

#### 6C.0.1.1 DL\_DCH\_FET\_Config = 0 

In each UL slot, the UL\_DPCH\_DYN\_DTX is set to TRUE if all of the
following conditions are satisfied:

\- This slot is in the second radio frame of 20ms CI.

\- UL\_DPCH\_10ms\_Mode is configured by higher layers.

Or, if all of the following conditions are satisfied:

\- Only a single transport channel is configured with 40ms TTI by higher
layers over UL DCH.

\- This slot is not in the first radio frame of 40ms CI.

\- This slot contains no UL DPDCH bits, i.e., no UL DCH transport blocks
are sent in this radio frame*.*

Otherwise UL\_DPCH\_DYN\_DTX is set to FALSE.

In each DL slot, the DL\_DPCH\_DYN\_DRX is set to TRUE if all of the
following conditions are satisfied:

\- This slot is in the second radio frame of 20ms CI.

\- DL DCH contains no SRBs in this radio frame*.*

\- UL\_DPCH\_10ms\_Mode is configured by higher layers.

Or, if all of the following conditions are satisfied:

\- Only a single transport channel is configured with 40ms TTI by higher
layers over DL DCH.

\- This slot is not in the first radio frame of 40ms CI.

\- DL DCH contains no SRBs in this radio frame*.*

Otherwise DL\_DPCH\_DYN\_DRX is set to FALSE.

#### 6C.0.1.2 DL\_DCH\_FET\_Config = 1

In each UL slot, the UL\_DPCH\_DYN\_DTX is set to TRUE if all of the
following conditions are satisfied, otherwise UL\_DPCH\_DYN\_DTX is set
to FALSE:

\- In this 20ms CI, excluding this slot, at least two UL DPCCH slots
that contain DL FET ACK bits (Subclause 4.3A of \[2\]) have been
transmitted.

\- UL\_DPCH\_10ms\_Mode is configured by higher layers and this slot is
in the second radio frame of 20ms CI.

In each DL slot, the DL\_DPCH\_DYN\_DRX is set to TRUE if all of the
following conditions are satisfied, otherwise DL\_DPCH\_DYN\_DRX is set
to FALSE

\- In this 20ms CI, at least two UL DPCCH slots that contain DL FET ACK
bits (Subclause 4.3A of \[2\]) have been transmitted before the end of
this DL slot.

\- UL\_DPCH\_DYN\_DTX in the UL slot started during this DL slot is
TRUE.

6C.1 Uplink CQI transmission
----------------------------

When UL\_DTX\_Active is FALSE (see clause 6C), the UE shall always
transmit the Channel-Quality Indication (CQI) in the CQI transmission
pattern defined in 6A.1.2.

When UL\_DTX\_Active is TRUE (see clause 6C), the UE shall perform the
following procedures:

\- The UE shall set the initial value of the variable CQI\_DTX\_Priority
to 1.

\- Reset the \"CQI nominal reporting timer\" to CQI\_DTX\_TIMER **at the
first HS-DPCCH subframe boundary.**

Afterwards, when UL\_DTX\_Active is TRUE, the UE sets the
CQI\_DTX\_Priority based on the status of a \"CQI nominal reporting
timer\" which is counting down to zero in HS-DPCCH subframes from the
value CQI\_DTX\_TIMER which is configured by higher layers.

The setting of CQI\_DTX\_Priority to 1 is described in subclause 6A.1.1.

Upon the expiration of the CQI nominal reporting timer, the UE shall set
CQI\_DTX\_Priority to 0.

CQI\_DTX\_Priority=0 indicates that CQI reports have lower priority than
the Uplink DPCCH burst pattern. If CQI\_DTX\_Priority is set to 0, the
UE shall transmit the Channel-Quality Indication (CQI), and all repeated
CQI transmissions (corresponding to the serving HS-DSCH cell and the
secondary serving HS-DSCH cell) according to the value of
N\_cqi\_transmit, only if the start of the CQI field corresponding to
the serving HS-DSCH cell in the CQI transmission pattern as defined in
6A.1.2 overlaps with a DPCCH transmission burst of the Uplink DPCCH
burst pattern as indicated in 6C.2.1.

CQI\_DTX\_Priority=1 indicates that CQI reports have higher priority
than the Uplink DPCCH burst pattern. If CQI\_DTX\_Priority is set to 1,

\- the UE shall always transmit the Channel-Quality Indication (CQI), in
the CQI transmission pattern defined in 6A.1.2.

\- The repeated CQI transmissions according to the value of
N\_cqi\_transmit are transmitted only if the start of the CQI field in
the CQI transmission pattern, as defined in 6A.1.2, is transmitted.

6C.2 Discontinuous uplink DPCCH/DPCCH2 transmission operation
-------------------------------------------------------------

When UL\_DTX\_Active is FALSE (see clause 6C) the UE shall transmit the
uplink DPCCH in each slot except in the following cases:

\- In the slots overlapping a compressed mode transmission gap.

\- If DL\_DCH\_FET\_Config is configured by higher layers, neither
HS-DSCH nor E-DCH is configured, and **UL\_DPCH\_DYN\_DTX is TRUE
(Subclause 6C.0).**

When UL\_DTX\_Active is TRUE (see clause 6C), in addition to the
conditions defined in 6C.5 the UE shall not transmit the uplink DPCCH in
a slot on an activated uplink frequency when all of the following
conditions are met for that uplink frequency:

1\. There is no HARQ-ACK transmission on HS-DPCCH as indicated in 6A.1
overlapping with the UL DPCCH slot,

2\. There is no CQI transmission on HS-DPCCH as indicated in 6C.1
overlapping with the UL DPCCH slot,

3\. There is no E-DCH transmission during the UL DPCCH slot,

4\. The slot is in a gap in the Uplink DPCCH burst pattern defined in
6C.2.1,

5\. The UL DPCCH preamble or postamble defined in 6C.2.2 is not
transmitted in the slot.

6\. Either the uplink frequency is a secondary uplink frequency where at
least Enabling\_Delay radio frames have passed since the activation of
the secondary uplink frequency was applied, or it is a primary uplink
frequency.

7\. If DL\_DCH\_FET\_Config is configured by higher layers,
UL\_DPCH\_DYN\_DTX is TRUE (subclause 6C.0).

The procedures for the F-DPCH transmission and reception in case of
discontinuous uplink DPCCH operation are defined in subclause 5.1.

The procedures for the F-TPICH transmission and reception in case of
discontinuous uplink DPCCH operation are defined in subclause 10.4.

When DPCCH2 is configured, DPCCH2 is transmitted only in the slots in
which DPCCH is transmitted.

### 6C.2.1 Uplink DPCCH burst pattern

The Uplink DPCCH burst pattern and the uplink DPCCH preamble and
postamble (6C.2.2) together define the discontinuous uplink DPCCH
operation.

NOTE: When the secondary uplink frequency is active and DTX enhancements
is configured, some of the parameters related to the discontinuous UL
DPCCH transmission as defined in \[5\] can be independently configured
for the two uplink frequencies.

The Uplink DPCCH burst pattern is illustrated in Figure 2A for 2ms E-DCH
TTI and Figure 2B for 10ms E-DCH TTI. The Uplink DPCCH burst pattern
defines the minimum set of slots where the UE shall transmit the
UL-DPCCH.

The Uplink DPCCH burst pattern shall be derived as follows.

If there has not been any E-DCH transmission for the last
Inactivity\_Threshold\_for\_UE\_DTX\_cycle\_2 E-DCH TTIs, and at least
this many TTIs have passed since the end of the Enabling\_Delay, then:

\- The transmission length in the Uplink DPCCH burst pattern shall be
UE\_DPCCH\_burst\_2 subframes.

\- The gap length following the DPCCH transmission burst in the Uplink
DPCCH burst pattern shall be

\- (UE\_DTX\_cycle\_2 -- UE\_DPCCH\_burst\_2) subframes,

\- The first subframe in each Uplink DPCCH burst pattern shall be such
that

\- the CFN and DPCCH subframe number S verify\
((5\*CFN - UE\_DTX\_DRX\_Offset + S) **MOD** UE\_DTX\_cycle\_2) = 0

Otherwise:

\- The transmission length in the Uplink DPCCH burst pattern shall be
UE\_DPCCH\_burst\_1 subframes.

\- The gap length following the DPCCH transmission burst in the Uplink
DPCCH burst pattern shall be

\- (UE\_DTX\_cycle\_1 -- UE\_DPCCH\_burst\_1) subframes.

\- The first subframe in each Uplink DPCCH burst pattern shall be such
that

\- the CFN and DPCCH subframe number S verify\
((5\*CFN - UE\_DTX\_DRX\_Offset + S) **MOD** UE\_DTX\_cycle\_1) = 0

In case the DTX cycle pattern changes during a transmission of an Uplink
DPCCH burst, the following shall apply:

\- the previously derived length of the Uplink DPCCH burst which has
already been started shall not be affected by the change of the DTX
cycle pattern.

\- if the UL DPCCH burst, which is derived according to the new DTX
cycle pattern, overlaps with the ongoing UL DPCCH burst, the
non-overlapping portion of the burst, if any, shall be transmitted.

\- the change in the DTX cycle pattern from UE\_DTX\_cycle\_2 to
UE\_DTX\_cycle\_1 shall occur only at the end of an E-DCH transmission.

NOTE: The E-DCH transmission start time after data transmission
inactivity may be restricted as described in \[9\] to allow
discontinuous reception at Node B.

Figure 2A: Example for Uplink DPCCH burst pattern for 2ms E-DCH TTI
beginning at CFN=1 (with UE\_DTX\_DRX\_Offset = 6)

Figure 2B: Example for Uplink DPCCH burst pattern for 10ms E-DCH TTI
beginning at CFN=1 (with UE\_DTX\_DRX\_Offset = 5)

Note: Figures 2A and 2B do not show the application of preambles and
postambles as described in subclause 6C.2.2.

### 6C.2.2 Uplink DPCCH preamble and postamble

NOTE: The "uplink DPCCH preamble" specified in this subclause is not the
same as the "uplink DPCCH power control preamble" specified in clauses 4
and 5.

#### 6C.2.2.1 Uplink DPCCH preamble and postamble for the DPCCH only transmission

If a UE will start a transmission of DPCCH based on the Uplink DPCCH
burst pattern at the start of slot s and finish its DPCCH transmission
at the end of slot t, the UE shall start the DPCCH transmission at the
start of slot s-2 and continue the DPCCH transmission till the end of
slot t+1.

#### 6C.2.2.2 Uplink DPCCH preamble and postamble for the E-DCH transmission

If a UE will start a transmission of E-DPCCH and E-DPDCH on a E-DCH TTI,
the UE shall start the DPCCH transmission 2 slots prior to the E-DCH TTI
and continue the DPCCH transmission during the E-DCH TTI and consecutive
E-DCH TTIs and 1 slot after the last consecutive E-DCH TTI.

In addition, if there has not been any E-DCH transmission for the last
Inactivity\_Threshold\_for\_UE\_DTX\_cycle\_2 E-DCH TTIs, and if a UE
will start a transmission of E-DPCCH and E-DPDCH on a E-DCH TTI, the UE
shall start the DPCCH transmission UE\_DTX\_long\_preamble\_length slots
prior to the E-DCH TTI and continue the DPCCH transmission during the
E-DCH TTI and consecutive E-DCH TTIs and 1 slot after the last
consecutive E-DCH TTI.

#### 6C.2.2.3 Uplink DPCCH preamble and postamble for the HS-DPCCH transmission

If a UE will start a transmission of HARQ-ACK, the UE shall start the
DPCCH transmission 2 slots prior to the DPCCH slot that coincides with
or overlaps the start of the HARQ-ACK field, unless the HARQ-ACK
transmission is an HARQ Preamble (PRE) in an HS-DPCCH sub-frame *n* -- 2
as defined in subclause 6A.1.1. The UE shall continue the DPCCH
transmission during the HARQ-ACK field and until the end of the first
full DPCCH slot after the end of the HARQ-ACK field.

If a UE will start a transmission of CQI, the UE shall start the DPCCH
transmission 3 slots prior to the DPCCH slot that coincides with or
overlaps the start of the CQI field, and continue the DPCCH transmission
during the CQI field and until the end of the first full DPCCH slot
after the end of the CQI field.

In addition, if there has not been any E-DCH transmission for the last
Inactivity\_Threshold\_for\_UE\_DTX\_cycle\_2 E-DCH TTIs, and if a UE
will start a transmission of CQI, the UE shall start the DPCCH
transmission (UE\_DTX\_long\_preamble\_length + 1) slots prior to the
DPCCH slot that coincides with or overlaps the start of the CQI field,
and continue the DPCCH transmission during the CQI field and until the
end of the first full DPCCH slot after the end of the CQI field. If the
transmission of the CQI is not known to the UE in advance due to the
change of CQI\_DTX\_Priority from 0 to 1, or due to the change from
UE\_DTX\_cycle\_1 to UE\_DTX\_cycle\_2, the preamble for the first CQI
after the change may start late resulting in a shorter preamble.

6C.3 Discontinuous downlink reception
-------------------------------------

The HS-SCCH reception pattern is derived from a discontinuous reception
subframe numbering as follows.

The discontinuous HS-SCCH reception subframe numbering is such that:

\- A HS-SCCH discontinuous reception radio frame is 10 ms long and is
indexed using CFN\_DRX.

\- The start of the HS-SCCH discontinuous reception radio frame of
CFN\_DRX n is aligned with the start of the HS-SCCH subframe that starts
τ~DRX~ chips after the start of the associated downlink F-DPCH of CFN n
where
$- \text{3840}\text{chips} \leq \tau_{\text{DRX}}\text{\ -}T_{0} < \text{3840}\text{chips}$.

\- The HS-SCCH subframe S\_DRX=0 is aligned with the start of the
HS-SCCH discontinuous reception radio frame. The HS-SCCH subframes are
numbered S\_DRX=0 to S\_DRX=4.

\- The HS-PDSCH discontinuous reception radio frame of CFN\_DRX n starts
τ~HS-PDSCH~ chips after the start of the HS-SCCH discontinuous reception
radio frame of CFN\_DRX n. The HS-PDSCH subframe S\_DRX=0 is aligned
with the start of the HS-PDSCH discontinuous reception radio frame. The
HS-PDSCH subframes are numbered S\_DRX=0 to S\_DRX=4.

\- The HS-DPCCH discontinuous transmission radio frame of CFN\_DRX n
starts at the HS-DPCCH subframe boundary closest in time to 1280 chips
after the start of the HS-SCCH discontinuous reception radio frame of
CFN\_DRX n as received at the UE. The HS-DPCCH subframe S\_DRX=0 is
aligned with the start of the HS-DPCCH discontinuous transmission radio
frame. The HS-DPCCH subframes are numbered S\_DRX=0 to S\_DRX=4.

If the UE has not detected consistent control information on HS-SCCH nor
received data on HS-PDSCH for the last
Inactivity\_Threshold\_for\_UE\_DRX\_cycle\_2 subframes, and at least
this many subframes have passed since the end of the Enabling\_Delay,
then:

\- The HS-SCCH reception pattern is the set of subframes whose HS-SCCH
discontinuous reception radio frame number CFN\_DRX and subframe number
S\_DRX verify:

((5\*CFN\_DRX - UE\_DTX\_DRX\_Offset + S\_DRX ) **MOD** UE\_DRX
cycle\_2) = 0

Otherwise:

\- The HS-SCCH reception pattern is the set of subframes whose HS-SCCH
discontinuous reception radio frame number CFN\_DRX and subframe number
S\_DRX verify:

((5\*CFN\_DRX - UE\_DTX\_DRX\_Offset + S\_DRX ) **MOD** UE\_DRX cycle) =
0

When the UE is configured with one or more secondary serving HS-DSCH
cells and if the UE has not detected consistent control information on
HS-SCCH nor received data on HS-PDSCH for the last
Inactivity\_Threshold\_for\_UE\_DRX\_cycle\_2 subframes, and at least
this many subframes have passed since the end of the Enabling\_Delay,
the UE shall perform the following procedures:

\- The secondary serving HS-DSCH cells shall be deactivated, and the UE
shall receive HS-SCCHs and HS-PDSCHs only from the serving HS-DSCH cell
in the HS-SCCH reception pattern according to the UE\_DRX\_cycle\_2.
HS-SCCH orders shall be used to reactivate the secondary serving HS-DSCH
cells as needed.

\- In case the secondary uplink frequency is activated, the associated
secondary serving HS-DSCH cell shall remain activated.

When DL\_DRX\_Active is FALSE (see clause 6C), the UE shall monitor and
receive all downlink physical channels continuously.

When DL\_DRX\_Active is TRUE (see clause 6C), the UE shall continue to
receive F-DPCH as described in subclause 5.1 and the UE need not receive
physical downlink channels other than the F-DPCH except for the
following cases:

1\. The UE shall receive E-HICH (sub-)frame corresponding to an E-DCH
transmission as specified in subclause 6B.

2\. The UE shall monitor the HS-SCCH subframes in the HS-SCCH reception
pattern.

3\. The UE shall receive an HS-PDSCH subframe as specified in subclause
6A.

4\. The UE has received an HS-SCCH or an HS-PDSCH subframe during the
last Inactivity\_Threshold\_for\_UE\_DRX\_cycle subframes which was not
an HS-SCCH order.

5\. The UE shall monitor E-AGCH and E-ROCH transmission from the serving
E-DCH cell in the following cases:

\- If UE\_DRX\_Grant\_Monitoring is TRUE and the E-AGCH/E-ROCH subframe
(in case of a 2ms TTI) or E-AGCH frame (in case of a 10ms TTI) overlaps
with the start of an HS-SCCH reception subframe as defined in the
HS-SCCH reception pattern,

\- When conditions defined in subclause 11.8.1.8 of \[9\] are fulfilled.

6\. The UE shall monitor E-RGCH transmission from a cell in the serving
E-DCH radio link set in the following cases:

\- If UE\_DRX\_Grant\_Monitoring is TRUE and the corresponding subframe
(in case of a 2ms TTI) or frame (in case of a 10ms TTI) of the serving
cell E-RGCH overlaps with the start of an HS-SCCH reception subframe as
defined in the HS-SCCH reception pattern.

\- When conditions defined in subclause 11.8.1.8 of \[9\] are fulfilled.

7\. The UE shall monitor the E-RGCH(s) from all the other cells in the
E-DCH active set, except from the cells in the serving E-DCH radio link
set, in the following case:

\- When conditions defined as determined in subclause 11.8.1.8 of \[9\]
are fulfilled.

The HS-SCCH reception pattern is illustrated by Figure 2C for a 2ms
E-DCH TTI. The grey subframes correspond to the HS-SCCH reception
pattern UE\_DRX\_cycle=4.

pattern, 2ms E-DCH TTI

The HS-SCCH reception pattern is illustrated by Figure 2D for a 10 ms
TTI E-DCH. The grey subframes correspond to the HS-SCCH reception
pattern *UE\_DRX\_cycle*=5.

#### 6C.3.1 Discontinuous downlink reception when the UE is in Multiflow mode

When the UE is in Multiflow mode the discontinuous downlink reception
for the time reference cell operates as defined in subclause 6C.3 for
the case when the UE is not in Multiflow mode.

The discontinuous HS-SCCH reception subframe numbering in the non-time
reference cell at the UE is such that:

\- The HS-SCCH discontinuous transmission radio frame of CFN\_DRX n in
the non-time reference cell is derived from the HS-SCCH discontinuous
transmission radio frame of CFN\_DRX n in the time reference cell, with
the related HS-PDSCH subframes are paired subframes, i.e. the
corresponding HARQ-ACK fields in the same HS-DPCCH sub-frame.

\- The HS-DPCCH discontinuous transmission radio frame of CFN\_DRX n in
the non-time reference cell is identical to the HS-DPCCH discontinuous
transmission radio frame of CFN\_DRX n in the time reference cell.

The discontinuous HS-SCCH reception subframe numbering in the non-time
reference cell at the NodeB is such that:

\- A HS-SCCH discontinuous reception radio frame is 10 ms long and is
indexed using CFN\_DRX.

\- The start of the HS-SCCH discontinuous reception radio frame of
CFN\_DRX n is aligned with the start of the HS-SCCH subframe that starts
τ~DRX~ chips after the start of the associated downlink F-DPCH of CFN n
where
$- \text{3840}\text{chips} \leq \tau_{\text{DRX}}\text{\ -}T_{0} - \text{7680} \ast \text{DRX}_{\text{OFFSET}} < \text{3840}\text{chips}$,
and *DRX\_OFFSET* is defined as
$\text{DRX}_{\text{OFFSET}} = \left\lfloor \frac{\frac{T_{\text{TX}_{\text{diff}}2}}{\text{2560}} - 0\text{.}9}{3} \right\rfloor - \left\lfloor \frac{\frac{T_{\text{TX}_{\text{diff}}1}}{\text{2560}} - 0\text{.}9}{3} \right\rfloor$,
where T~TX\_diff1~ and T~TX\_diff2~ are as defined in \[1\].

\- The HS-SCCH subframe S\_DRX=0 is aligned with the start of the
HS-SCCH discontinuous reception radio frame. The HS-SCCH subframes are
numbered S\_DRX=0 to S\_DRX=4.

\- The HS-PDSCH discontinuous reception radio frame of CFN\_DRX n starts
τ~HS-PDSCH~ chips after the start of the HS-SCCH discontinuous reception
radio frame of CFN\_DRX n. The HS-PDSCH subframe S\_DRX=0 is aligned
with the start of the HS-PDSCH discontinuous reception radio frame. The
HS-PDSCH subframes are numbered S\_DRX=0 to S\_DRX=4.

\- The HS-DPCCH discontinuous transmission radio frame of CFN\_DRX n
starts at the HS-DPCCH subframe boundary closest in time to 1280+
T~TX\_diff1~ -- T~TX\_diff2~ after the start of the HS-SCCH
discontinuous reception radio frame of CFN\_DRX n as received at the UE.
The HS-DPCCH subframe S\_DRX=0 is aligned with the start of the HS-DPCCH
discontinuous transmission radio frame. The HS-DPCCH subframes are
numbered S\_DRX=0 to S\_DRX=4.

6C.4 HS-SCCH orders
-------------------

When the UE is not configured in Multiflow mode, the Node B may activate
and deactivate the discontinuous downlink reception operation and
discontinuous uplink DPCCH transmission operation through physical layer
commands transmitted on one of the HS-SCCH in the HS-SCCH set as
specified in \[2\] and in subclause 6A.1.1.

When E-DCH\_decoupling is configured, discontinuous uplink DPCCH
transmission cannot be deactivated or activated through HS-SCCH orders.

\- The activation and deactivation of the discontinuous uplink DPCCH
transmission operation is applied by the UE at the earliest E-DCH TTI
boundary coinciding with or following the beginning of the HS-DPCCH
subframe containing the HARQ-ACK corresponding to the order.

\- The activation and deactivation of the discontinuous downlink
reception operation is applied by the UE 12 slots after the ending of
the HS-SCCH subframe delivering the order.

\- The activation and deactivation shall affect all frequencies
configured to the UE.

6C.5 Operation during compressed mode 
-------------------------------------

When in compressed mode, the UE shall behave according to subclauses
6A.3 and 6B.4 including the following rules.

The uplink discontinuous transmission operation is not impacted by the
compressed mode in the radio frames that do not overlap an uplink
compressed mode transmission gap as defined in subclause 6.1.1 of \[4\].

In radio frames that overlap an uplink compressed mode transmission gap
as defined in subclause 6.1.1 of \[4\], the uplink DPCCH shall be
transmitted in all slots in the radio frame that do not overlap the
uplink compressed mode transmission gap if either of the following is
true:

\- an uplink DPCCH transmission defined by the Uplink DPCCH burst
pattern according to subclause 6C.2.1 overlaps an uplink compressed mode
transmission gap, or

\- an uplink DPCCH preamble or postamble according to subclause 6C.2.2
corresponding to an uplink DPCCH transmission defined by the Uplink
DPCCH burst pattern overlaps an uplink compressed mode transmission gap.

If the 2 bullets above are not true, the following are not affected by
compressed mode:

\- uplink DPCCH transmission according to Uplink DPCCH burst patterns
defined in subclause 6C.2.1,

\- uplink DPCCH preamble transmission corresponding to an uplink DPCCH
transmission defined by the Uplink DPCCH burst pattern,

\- uplink DPCCH postamble transmission corresponding to an uplink DPCCH
transmission defined by the Uplink DPCCH burst pattern.

If part of an uplink DPCCH preamble or postamble corresponding to an
E-DCH or HS-DPCCH transmission overlaps an uplink compressed mode
transmission gap, then that part of the preamble or postamble shall not
be transmitted.

If an HS-SCCH subframe in the HS-SCCH reception pattern for downlink
discontinuous reception according to subclause 6C.3 overlaps with a
downlink compressed mode transmission gap, the following is true:

\- the reception of an HS-SCCH subframe is postponed to the first full
HS-SCCH subframe after the downlink compressed mode transmission gap.

\- if UE\_DRX\_Grant\_Monitoring is TRUE and the conditions defined in
subclause 11.8.1.8 of \[9\] are not fulfilled, the UE may discard the
E-AGCH/E-ROCH and E-RGCH subframe (in case of 2ms TTI) or frame (in case
of 10ms TTI) that overlaps with the start of the postponed HS-SCCH
subframe.

Note that the compressed mode parameters (see \[5\]) "UL compressed mode
method", "DL compressed mode method" and "scrambling code change" have
no effect on the UE behaviour while DTX\_DRX\_STATUS is TRUE.

7 Closed loop mode 1 transmit diversity
=======================================

The general transmitter structure to support closed loop mode transmit
diversity for DPCH transmission is shown in figure 3. Channel coding,
interleaving and spreading are done as in non-diversity mode. The spread
complex valued signal is fed to both TX antenna branches, and weighted
with antenna specific weight factors *w~1\ ~*and *w~2~*. The weight
factor *w~1~* is a constant scalar and the weight factor *w~2~* is
complex valued signal.

The weight factor *w~2~* (actually the corresponding phase adjustment)
is determined by the UE, and signalled to the UTRAN access point (i.e.
cell transceiver) using the FBI field of uplink DPCCH.

For the closed loop mode 1 different orthogonal dedicated pilot symbols
in the DPCCH are sent on the 2 different antennas. Closed-loop transmit
diversity for DPCH is not supported with downlink slot formats 17 and 18
in \[1\].

Figure 3: The generic downlink transmitter structure to support closed
loop mode transmit diversity for DPCH transmission.

Closed loop mode 1 characteristics are summarised in the Table 8. The
use of the closed loop mode 1 is controlled via higher layer signalling.

Table 8: Summary of number of feedback information bits per slot,
N~FBD~, feedback command length in slots, N~W~, feedback command rate,
feedback bit rate, number of phase bits, N~ph~, per signalling word,
number of amplitude bits, N~po,~ per signalling word and amount of
constellation rotation at UE for the closed loop mode 1.

  -------- ------ ------------- ------------------- ------- ------- ------------------------

7.1 General procedure
---------------------

The UE uses the CPICH to separately estimate the channels seen from each
antenna.

Once every slot, the UE computes the phase adjustment, *φ*, that should
be applied at the UTRAN access point to maximise the UE received power.
During soft handover, the UE computes the phase adjustment to maximise
the total UE received power from the cells in the active set. In the
case that a HS-PDSCH is associated with a DPCH for which closed loop
mode 1 is applied, the antenna weights applied to the HS-PDSCH, are the
same as the antenna weights applied to the associated DPCH. In case a
HS-PDSCH is associated with a DPCH during soft handover, the UE may
emphasize the radio link transmitted from HS-DSCH serving cell,
respectively, when calculating the antenna weights. An example of how
the computations can be accomplished is given in Annex A.2.

The UE feeds back to the UTRAN access point the information on which
phase/power settings to use. Feedback Signalling Message (FSM) bits are
transmitted in the FBI field of uplink DPCCH slot(s) (see \[1\]). Each
message is of length *N~W~* = *N~po~*+*N~ph~* bits and its format is
shown in the figure 4. The transmission order of bits is from MSB to
LSB, i.e. MSB is transmitted first. FSM~po~ and FSM~ph~ subfields are
used to transmit the power and phase settings, respectively.

Figure 4: Format of feedback signalling message. FSM~po~ transmits the
power setting and FSM~ph~ the phase setting.

The adjustments are made by the UTRAN Access Point at the beginning of
the downlink DPCCH pilot field. The downlink slot in which the
adjustment is done is signalled to L1 of UE by higher layers. Two
possibilities exist:

1\) When feedback command is transmitted in uplink slot *i*, which is
transmitted approximately 1024 chips in offset from the received
downlink slot *j*, the adjustment is done at the beginning of the pilot
field of the downlink slot (*j*+1) mod 15.

2\) When feedback command is transmitted in uplink slot *i*, which is
transmitted approximately 1024 chips in offset from the received
downlink slot *j*, the adjustment is done at the beginning of the pilot
field of the downlink slot (*j*+2) mod 15.

Thus, adjustment timing at UTRAN Access Point is either according to 1)
or 2) as controlled by the higher layers.

In case of soft handover, Layer 1 shall support different adjustment
timing values for different radio links in the same active set.

The timing of the weight adjustment of the HS-PDSCH is such that the
HS-PDSCH weight adjustment is done at the HS-PDSCH slot border,
respectively, M chips after the adjustment of the associated DPCH, where
0 ≤ M \< 2560.

7.2 Determination of feedback information
-----------------------------------------

The UE uses the CPICH transmitted both from antenna 1 and antenna 2 to
calculate the phase adjustment to be applied at UTRAN access point to
maximise the UE received power. In each slot, UE calculates the optimum
phase adjustment, *φ*, for antenna 2, which is then quantized into
$\varphi_{Q}$ having two possible values as follows:

$\varphi_{Q} = \left\{ \begin{matrix}
\pi, & \text{if\ }\frac{\pi}{2} < \varphi - \varphi_{r}(i) \leq 3\frac{\pi}{2} \\
0, & \text{otherwise} \\
\end{matrix} \right.\ $ (1)

where:

$\varphi_{r}(i) = \begin{matrix}
\left\{ 0,i = 0,2,4,6,8,\text{10},\text{12},\text{14} \middle| \right.\  \\
\end{matrix}$ (2)

If $\varphi_{Q}$= 0, a command \'0\' is send to UTRAN using the FSM~ph~
field. Correspondingly, if $\varphi_{Q}$ = π, command \'1\' is send to
UTRAN using the FSM~ph~ field.

Due to rotation of the constellation at UE the UTRAN interprets the
received commands according to table 9 which shows the mapping between
phase adjustment, $\varphi_{i}$, and received feedback command for each
uplink slot.

Table 9: Phase adjustments, *φ~i~,* corresponding to feedback commands
for the slots *i* of the UL radio frame

  --------- --- --- ------ --- ------ --- ------ --- ------ --- ------ ---- ------ ---- ------ ---
  Slot \#   0   1   2      3   4      5   6      7   8      9   10     11   12     13   14     
  FSM       0   0   π/2    0   π/2    0   π/2    0   π/2    0   π/2    0    π/2    0    π/2    0

  --------- --- --- ------ --- ------ --- ------ --- ------ --- ------ ---- ------ ---- ------ ---

The weight *w~2~* is then calculated by averaging the received phases
over 2 consecutive slots. Algorithmically, *w~2~* is calculated as
follows:

$w_{2} = \frac{\sum_{i = n - 1}^{n}{\text{cos}(\varphi_{i})}}{2} + j\frac{\sum_{i = n - 1}^{n}{\text{sin}(\varphi_{i})}}{2}$
(3)

where:

$\varphi_{i} \in \left\{ 0,\pi,\frac{\pi}{2}, - \frac{\pi}{2} \right\}$
(4)

For antenna 1, *w~1~* is constant:

$w_{1} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$ (5)

### 7.2.1 End of frame adjustment

In closed loop mode 1 at frame borders the averaging operation is
slightly modified. Upon reception of the FB command for slot 0 of a
frame, the average is calculated based on the command for slot 13 of the
previous frame and the command for slot 0 of the current frame, i.e.
*φ~i~* from slot 14 is not used:

$w_{2} = \frac{\text{cos}(\varphi_{\text{13}}^{j - 1}) + \text{cos}(\varphi_{0}^{j})}{2} + j\frac{\text{sin}(\varphi_{\text{13}}^{j - 1}) + \text{sin}(\varphi_{0}^{j})}{2}$
(6)

where:

\- $\varphi_{\text{13}}^{j - 1}$ = phase adjustment from frame j-1, slot
13.

\- $\varphi_{0}^{j}$ = phase adjustment from frame j, slot 0.

### 7.2.2 Normal initialisation

For the first frame of transmission UE determines the feedback commands
in a normal way and sends them to UTRAN.

Before the first FB command is received, the UTRAN shall use the initial
weight $w_{2} = \frac{1}{2}(1 + j)$.

Having received the first FB command the UTRAN calculates *w~2~* as
follows:

$w_{2} = \frac{\text{cos}(\frac{\pi}{2}) + \text{cos}(\varphi_{0})}{2} + j\frac{\text{sin}(\frac{\pi}{2}) + \text{sin}(\varphi_{0})}{2}$
(7)

where:

$\varphi_{0}$ = phase adjustment from slot 0 of the first frame.

### 7.2.3 Operation during compressed mode

#### 7.2.3.1 Downlink in compressed mode and uplink in normal mode

When downlink is in compressed mode but uplink is operating normally
(i.e. not compressed) the UTRAN continues it\'s Tx diversity related
functions in the same way as in non-compressed downlink mode.

In downlink transmission gaps there are uplink slots for which no new
estimate of the phase adjustment is calculated. During these slots the
following rules are applied in UE when determining the feedback command:

1\) If no new estimate of phase adjustment *φ~i~* exists corresponding
to the feedback command to be sent in uplink slot *i*:

\- If 1 \< *i* \< 15:

\- the feedback command sent in uplink slot *i*-2 is used;

\- else if *i* = 0:

\- the feedback command sent in uplink slot 14 of previous frame is
used;

\- else if *i* = 1:

\- the feedback command sent in uplink slot 13 of previous frame is
used;

\- end if.

2\) When transmission in downlink is started again in downlink slot
N~last~+1 (if N~last~+1 = 15, then slot 0 in the next frame) the UE must
resume calculating new estimates of the phase adjustment. The feedback
command corresponding to the first new estimate of *φ~i~* must be sent
in the uplink slot which is transmitted approximately 1024 chips in
offset from the downlink slot N~last~+1.

#### 7.2.3.2 Both downlink and uplink in compressed mode

During the uplink transmission gaps no FB commands are sent from UE to
UTRAN. When transmission in downlink is started again in downlink slot
N~last~+1 (if N~last~+1 = 15, then slot 0 in the next frame) the UE must
resume calculating new estimates of the phase adjustment. The feedback
command corresponding to the first new estimate of *φ~i~* must be sent
in the uplink slot which is transmitted approximately 1024 chips in
offset from the downlink slot N~last~+1.

The UTRAN continues to update the weight *w*~2~ until the uplink
transmission gap starts and no more FB commands are received. When the
transmission in downlink resumes in slot N~last~+1, the value of *w*~2~,
calculated after receiving the last FB command before the start of the
uplink transmission gap, is applied to antenna 2 signal.

After the UE resumes transmission in uplink and sends the first FB
command, the new value of *w*~2~ is calculated as follows:

\- S~1~ = {0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 14}.

\- S~2~ = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13}.

\- i = number of uplink slot at which the transmission resumes.

\- j = number of uplink slot at which the last FB command was sent
before the start of the uplink transmission gap.

\- Do while ($i \in S_{1}\ \text{and}\ j \in S_{1}$) or
($i \in S_{2}\ \text{and}\ j \in S_{2}$):

\- j = j-1;

\- if j \< 0;

\- j = 14;

\- end if;

\- end do;

\- calculate *w*~2~ based on FB commands received in uplink slots i and
j.

Note that for N~last~ = 13 the end of frame adjustment procedure shall
be based on the FB commands for the last odd slot prior to the uplink
transmission gap and slot 0.

#### 7.2.3.3 Uplink in compressed mode and downlink in normal mode

The UTRAN continues to update the value of *w*~2~ until the uplink
transmission gap starts and no more FB commands are received. Then, the
value of *w*~2~ calculated after receiving the last FB command before
the uplink transmission gap is applied to the antenna 2 signal. When the
UE resumes transmission in uplink, it shall send FB commands according
to subclause 7.2 equations 2 and 3 (normal operation) and the UTRAN
Access Point shall interpret the FB commands according to Table 9.

The calculation of w~2~ by the UTRAN following the uplink transmission
gap, and before the first two FB commands following the gap are received
is not specified.

### 7.2.4 Initialisation during compressed mode

#### 7.2.4.1 Downlink in compressed mode

When closed loop mode 1 is initialised during the downlink transmission
gap of compressed mode there are slots for which no estimate of the
phase adjustment is calculated and no previous feedback command is
available.

In this case, if the UE is required to send feedback in the uplink, the
FB command to the UTRAN shall be '0'.

When transmission in downlink is started again in slot N~last~+1 (if
N~last~+1 = 15, then slot 0 in the next frame), the UTRAN shall use the
initial weight $w_{2} = \frac{1}{2}(1 + j)$. The UE must start
calculating estimates of the phase adjustment. The feedback command
corresponding to the first estimate of *φ~i~* must be sent in the uplink
slot which is transmitted approximately 1024 chips in offset from the
downlink slot N~last~+1. Having received this feedback command the UTRAN
calculates *w~2~* as follows:

$w_{2} = \frac{\text{cos}(\varphi_{i}) + \text{cos}(\varphi_{j})}{2} + j\frac{\text{sin}(\varphi_{i}) + \text{sin}(\varphi_{j})}{2}$
(8)

where:

$\varphi_{i}$ = phase adjustment in uplink slot i , which is transmitted
approximately 1024 chips in offset from the downlink slot N~last~+1.

$\varphi_{j} = \frac{\pi}{2}$, if slot i is even (
$i \in \left\{ 0,\ 2,\ 4,\ 6,\ 8,\ \text{10},\ \text{12},\ \text{14} \right\}$
) and

$\varphi_{j} = 0$, if slot i is odd (
$i \in \left\{ 1,\ 3,\ 5,\ 7,\ 9,\ \text{11},\ \text{13} \right\}$ )

8 Idle periods for IPDL location method
=======================================

8.1 General
-----------

To support time difference measurements for location services, idle
periods can be created in the downlink (hence the name IPDL) during
which time transmission of all channels from a Node B is temporarily
seized. During these idle periods the visibility of neighbour cells from
the UE is improved.

The idle periods are arranged in a predetermined pseudo random fashion
according to higher layer parameters. Idle periods differ from
compressed mode in that they are shorter in duration, all channels are
silent simultaneously, and no attempt is made to prevent data loss.

In general there are two modes for these idle periods:

\- Continuous mode, and

\- Burst mode.

In continuous mode the idle periods are active all the time. In burst
mode the idle periods are arranged in bursts where each burst contains
enough idle periods to allow a UE to make sufficient measurements for
its location to be calculated. The bursts are separated by a period
where no idle periods occur.

8.2 Parameters of IPDL
----------------------

The following parameters are signalled to the UE via higher layers:

**IP\_Status:** This is a logic value that indicates if the idle periods
are arranged in continuous or burst mode.

**IP\_Spacing:** The number of 10 ms radio frames between the start of a
radio frame that contains an idle period and the next radio frame that
contains an idle period. Note that there is at most one idle period in a
radio frame.

**IP\_Length:** The length of the idle periods, expressed in symbols of
the CPICH.

**IP\_Offset:** A cell specific offset that can be used to synchronise
idle periods from different sectors within a Node B.

**Seed:** Seed for the pseudo random number generator.

Additionally in the case of burst mode operation the following
parameters are also communicated to the UE.

**Burst\_Start:** Specifies the start of the first burst of idle
periods. 256×Burst\_Start is the SFN where the first burst of idle
periods starts.

**Burst\_Length:** The number of idle periods in a burst of idle
periods.

**Burst\_Freq:** Specifies the time between the start of a burst and the
start of the next burst. 256×Burst\_Freq is the number of radio frames
of the primary CPICH between the start of a burst and the start of the
next burst.

8.3 Calculation of idle period position
---------------------------------------

In burst mode, burst \#0 starts in the radio frame with SFN =
256×Burst\_Start. Burst \#*k* starts in the radio frame with SFN =
256×Burst\_Start + *k*×256×Burst\_Freq( *k* = 0,1,2, ...). The sequence
of bursts according to this formula continues up to and including the
radio frame with SFN = 4095. At the start of the radio frame with SFN =
0, the burst sequence is terminated (no idle periods are generated) and
at SFN = 256×Burst\_Start the burst sequence is restarted with burst \#0
followed by burst \#1 etc., as described above.

Continuous mode is equivalent to burst mode, with only one burst
spanning the whole SFN cycle of 4096 radio frames, this burst starting
in the radio frame with SFN = 0.

Assume that IP\_Position(*x*) is the position of idle period number *x*
within a burst, where *x* = 1, 2, ..., and IP\_Position(*x*) is measured
in number of CPICH symbols from the start of the first radio frame of
the burst.

The positions of the idle periods within each burst are then given by
the following equation:

IP\_Position(*x*) = (*x* × IP\_Spacing × 150) + (rand(*x* modulo 64)
modulo (150 -- IP\_Length)) + IP\_Offset;

where rand(*m*) is a pseudo random generator defined as follows:

rand(0) = Seed;

rand(*m*) = (106×rand(*m* -- 1) + 1283) modulo 6075, *m* = 1, 2, 3, ....

Note that *x* is reset to *x* = 1 for the first idle period in every
burst.

Figure 6 below illustrates the idle periods for the burst mode case.

Figure 6: Idle Period placement in the case of burst mode operation

9 MIMO operation of HS-DSCH
===========================

There are two possibilities for operating MIMO: MIMO mode when
single-stream restriction is not configured, in which both single and
dual stream transmission can be applied, and MIMO mode when
single-stream restriction is configured, which is restricted only to
single stream transmission. This section applies only when a UE is
configured in MIMO mode.

The general transmitter structure to support MIMO operation of HS-PDSCH
transmission is shown in figure 7. Channel coding, interleaving and
spreading are done as in non-MIMO mode. When single-stream restriction
is not configured the Node B scheduler can decide to transmit one or two
transport blocks to a UE in one TTI in the serving HS-DSCH cell, and one
or two transport blocks in a secondary serving HS-DSCH cell if the UE is
configured with a secondary serving HS-DSCH cell in which MIMO is
configured, whereas when single-stream restriction is configured only
transmission of single transport block is allowed in any of the cells.
The spread complex valued signals are fed to both TX antenna branches,
and weighted with precoding weights *w~1~*, *w~2~, w~3~* and *w~4~*. The
precoding weights *w~1~* and *w~3\ ~* are constant real valued scalars
and the precoding weights *w~2~* and *w~4\ ~*are variable complex valued
scalars. The precoding weights *w~1~*, *w~2~*, *w~3~* and *w~4~* are
defined as follows:

$w_{3} = w_{1} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$,

$w_{4} = - w_{2}$,

$w_{2} \in \begin{Bmatrix}
\frac{1 + j}{2}, & \frac{1 - j}{2}, & \frac{- 1 + j}{2}, & \frac{- 1 - j}{2} \\
\end{Bmatrix}$.

If single-stream restriction is configured, or single-stream restriction
is not configured and the Node B schedules a single transport block in a
cell to a UE in one TTI, it uses the precoding vector (*w~1,~ w~2~*) for
transmission of that transport block on the HS-PDSCH sub-frame. If
single-stream restriction is not configured and the UTRAN schedules two
transport blocks in a cell to a UE in one TTI, it uses two orthogonal
precoding vectors to transmit the two transport blocks. The precoding
vector (*w~1,~ w~2~*) is called the primary precoding vector which is
used for transmitting the primary transport block and the precoding
vector (*w~3,~ w~4~*) is called secondary precoding vector which is used
for transmitting the secondary transport block, respectively.

If single-stream restriction is configured (Figure 7a) the secondary
transport block is never present. If single-stream restriction is not
configured (figure 7) the Node B can dynamically schedule the UE with
one or two transport blocks.

Figure 7: The generic downlink transmitter structure to support MIMO
operation for HS-PDSCH transmission when single-stream restriction is
not configured.

Figure 7a: The generic downlink transmitter structure to support MIMO
operation for HS-PDSCH transmission when single-stream restriction is
configured.

9.1 General procedure
---------------------

The UE uses the CPICH to separately estimate the channels seen from each
antenna. One of the antennas will transmit the Antenna 1 modulation
pattern of the P-CPICH as defined in subclause 5.3.3.1 of \[1\]. The
other antenna will transmit either the Antenna 2 modulation pattern of
the P-CPICH or the Antenna 1 modulation pattern of a S-CPICH. The Pilot
configuration in support of MIMO operation of HS-DSCH in the cell is
signalled by higher layers.

The UE determines a preferred primary precoding vector
$\left( w_{1}^{\text{pref}},w_{2}^{\text{pref}} \right)$ and signals it
to the Node B. The signalled information about the preferred primary
precoding vector is termed precoding control indication (PCI) and is
defined in subclause 6A.4. The PCI is signalled to the Node B together
with channel quality indication (CQI) as a composite PCI/CQI report
according to the procedure defined in subclause 6A.1.2.2. The UE
transmits the composite PCI/CQI report to the Node B using the CQI field
on the HS-DPCCH as defined in \[1\]. Based on the composite PCI/CQI
reports, the Node B scheduler decides when single-stream restriction is
not configured whether to schedule one or two transport blocks in a cell
to a UE in one TTI and what transport block size(s) and modulation
scheme(s) to use for each of them.

The Node B signals to the UE the precoding weight *w~2~* applied on the
HS-PDSCH sub-frame using the precoding weight indication bits of part 1
of the corresponding HS-SCCH sub-frame. The precoding weight adjustment
of each HS-PDSCH is done at the HS-PDSCH sub-frame border.

10 Uplink Closed Loop Transmit Diversity operation
==================================================

The use of uplink CLTD is controlled by higher layer signalling. If the
UE is configured with UL CLTD, then UL\_CLTD\_Enabled is set to TRUE,
otherwise UL\_CLTD\_Enabled is set to FALSE and UL\_CLTD\_Active is 0.
UL\_CLTD\_Active shall be set to 1, 2 or 3 while UL\_CLTD\_Enabled is
TRUE and *CLTD activation state 1, 2 or 3* is activated through HS-SCCH
orders respectively.

At the time when UL\_CLTD\_Enabled is set to TRUE, UL\_CLTD\_Active
shall be set to 1 or 2 as indicated by higher layer signaling. *If
activation state 1 is configured, or a transition from a different
activation state to activation state 1 occurs through an* HS-SCCH
order*, the TPI* *is initially set to the fixed precoder weight
corresponding to the bit pattern* \"*1100*\" in Table 10*.* The
parameter UL\_CLTD\_Active may be further switched to other *CLTD
activation states* through HS-SCCH orders, as described in \[2\].

*Upon higher layer signaling that does not result in a serving cell
change, the UE shall* remember *its current* UL CLTD *activation* state
and use the last received pre-coding vector after the RRC
reconfiguration. *Upon higher layer signaling that results in serving
cell change, CLTD activation state is either reset* or maintained in the
RRC reconfiguration message. *If activation state 1 is configured, the
TPI* *is initially set to the fixed precoder weight corresponding to the
bit pattern* \"*1100*\" in Table 10*.*

The secondary dedicated pilot channel, S-DPCCH, is transmitted as long
as UL DPCCH is transmitted when UL\_CLTD\_Enabled is TRUE and
UL\_CLTD\_Active is set to 1.

10.1 General procedure
----------------------

The general transmitter structure to support uplink CLTD *activation
state 1* is shown in Figure 8. Channel coding, interleaving and
spreading are done as in the case where uplink CLTD is not configured.
If UL\_CLTD\_Active is 1, the complex-valued signal after spreading is
fed to both TX antenna branches and weighted with precoding weights
*w~1~*, *w~2~, w~3~* and *w~4~*. The same precoding weights, *w~1~* and
*w~2~*, are always applied to DPCCH, DPCCH2 and DPDCH if present,
E-DPCCH, E-DPDCH and the HS-DPCCH. The S-DPCCH is pre-coded with
precoding weights *w~3\ ~*and *w~4~*.

The beamforming weight matrix is given by

$\begin{bmatrix}
w_{1} & w_{3} \\
w_{2} & w_{4} \\
\end{bmatrix}$=$\begin{bmatrix}
\text{ae}^{- j\frac{\theta}{2}} & \text{ae}^{- j\frac{\theta}{2}} \\
\text{ae}^{j\frac{\theta}{2}} & - \text{ae}^{j\frac{\theta}{2}} \\
\end{bmatrix}$

where normalized amplitude $a = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$ and
$\theta = \theta^{(n + 1)}$ is the phase to be applied in the current
*TPI update period*, which is determined as follows.

Let ${\overset{\sim}{\theta}}^{(n + 1)}$ be the currently received TPI
phase calculated by the NodeB and signalled to the UE via the F-TPICH
bit pattern, and $\theta^{(n)}$ the phase applied in the previous *TPI
update period*.

Then the final beamforming phase applied $\theta^{(n + 1)}$ for the
current *TPI update period* is calculated as:

where

and

The mapping between the F-TPICH bit pattern and the TPI phase
${\overset{\sim}{\theta}}^{(n + 1)}$ is given by Table 10.

Figure 8: The generic uplink transmitter structure to support UL CLTD
activation state 1

The channel combining for UL CLTD when UL\_CLTD\_Enabled is set to TRUE
is described in \[3\] subclause 4.2.4. When UL\_CLTD\_Active is not
equal to 1, no UL closed loop beamforming is performed for uplink
transmission.

In the case that UL\_CLTD\_Active is 2, the
DPCCH/DPCCH2/DPDCH/E-DPCCH/E-DPDCH/HS-DPCCH are transmitted on antenna
1, and S-DPCCH is switched off.

In the case that UL\_CLTD\_Active is 3, the
DPCCH/DPCCH2/DPDCH/E-DPCCH/E-DPDCH/HS-DPCCH are transmitted on antenna
2, and S-DPCCH is switched off.

10.2 Downlink TPI transmission and control timing
-------------------------------------------------

If UL\_CLTD\_Enabled is TRUE and UL\_CLTD\_Active is 1, the Node B
determines a precoding phase which is signalled to the UE using the
allocated TPI field on the F-TPICH as defined in \[1\]; see also Table
10. The following applies:

\- if the UE is configured with an HS-DPCCH, higher layers indicate to
the UE which cells in the active set transmit the F-TPICH, with the
restriction that either only the HS-DSCH serving cell transmits the
F-TPICH or all cells from the serving radio link set transmit the
F-TPICH.

\- if the UE is not configured with an HS-DPCCH, higher layers indicate
to the UE which cells in the active set transmit the F-TPICH, with the
restriction that either only one cell transmits the F-TPICH or all cells
from one radio link set transmit the F-TPICH.

\- When E-DCH\_decoupling is configured, higher layers indicate to the
UE which cells in the active set transmit the F-TPICH, with the
restriction that either only the E-DCH serving cell transmits the
F-TPICH, or only HS-DSCH serving cell transmits the F-TPICH or all cells
from the serving radio link set transmit the F-TPICH.

The TPI information update rate is 3 slots. However, the uplink channel
measurement periods are not specified for Node B. The UE shall apply the
precoding weight indicated by the TPI on the first DPCCH slot boundary,
after 512 chips after

\- the end of the TPI field carrying the second of the two bits in the
TPI bit pattern, if the F-TPICH is configured to be transmitted from one
radio link only.

\- the end of the last TPI field carrying the second of the two bits in
a TPI bit pattern received during a TPI combining period, if the F-TPICH
is configured to be transmitted from multiple radio links.

The UE shall measure the reliability of the received TPI bits over the 3
slot period in which the TPI bit pattern corresponding to a precoding
weight is received. The received TPI bits are mapped to precoding
weights and applied by the UE only if the estimated quality of the TPI
bits is determined to be better than a threshold Q~tpi~. Otherwise, the
UE shall apply the precoding weights corresponding to the last reliably
received TPI bit pattern. Q~tpi~ is defined implicitly by the relevant
tests in \[7\].

10.3 Combining TPI bits from multiple radio links
-------------------------------------------------

When a UE is in softer handover and if F-TPICH is configured to be
transmitted from multiple radio links as defined in subclause 10.2, the
UE may assume that the transmitted TPI bits from those radio links in a
TPI combining period are the same. The TPI combining period has the
length of one slot, beginning at the downlink slot boundary of the
F-TPICH. Upon reception of one or more TPI bits in a TPI combining
period, the UE combines all the TPI bits received in that TPI combining
period into a single TPI bit.

10.4 Operation during discontinuous uplink DPCCH operation
----------------------------------------------------------

When UL\_DTX\_Active is TRUE (see clause 6C), the UE shall not transmit
the uplink S-DPCCH in a slot where UE does not transmit uplink DPCCH
according to subclause 6C.2.

The UE shall ignore any TPI commands received in an F-TPICH subframe
starting during an uplink DPCCH slot which is in an uplink DPCCH
transmission gap as defined in subclause 6C.2. When uplink transmission
resumes after a transmission gap, the UE shall apply the precoding
weights corresponding to the last applied TPI before the uplink DPCCH
transmission gap until a new reliable TPI is received.

10.5 Operation during compressed mode
-------------------------------------

### 10.5.1 Uplink compressed mode

In the case that UL\_CLTD\_Active is *1*, the UE shall keep the last
applied TPI before an uplink transmission gap until a new reliable TPI
is received.

### 10.5.2 Downlink compressed mode

The following applies for the UE for reception of F-TPICH, during
compressed mode on the DPCH or F-DPCH:

The UE shall decode F-TPICH transmissions in all slots that do not
overlap with a downlink transmission gap. The UE shall ignore the other
TPI bit if one of the two slots carrying the TPI bits overlaps a
downlink transmission gap.

10.6 HS-SCCH orders
-------------------

The Node B may switch uplink CLTD activation state to one of three *CLTD
activation states* through HS-SCCH orders as described in \[2\].
*HS-SCCH ordered transitions between any CLTD activation states are
applied at the first E-DCH slot boundary after the end of the HS-DPCCH
subframe in which the ACK is sent.* The maximum allowed interruption
time is 2 slots, ending a*t the end of the HS-DPCCH subframe in which
the ACK is sent.* If the UE receives an HS-SCCH order for transitioning
to an activation state that is already being applied, then the UE shall
not change its activation state, but shall transmit the HARQ-ACK
acknowledging the HS-SCCH order.

When E-DCH\_decoupling is configured, CLTD activation state cannot be
changed through HS-SCCH orders.

11 Uplink MIMO
==============

If the UE is configured with UL MIMO, then UL\_MIMO\_Enabled is set to
TRUE, otherwise UL\_MIMO\_Enabled is set to FALSE. When
UL\_MIMO\_Enabled is set to TRUE, UL\_CLTD\_Enabled is also set to TRUE.
UL\_CLTD\_Active can be set to 1, 2 or 3 while UL\_MIMO\_Enabled is TRUE
and *CLTD activation state can be changed* through HS-SCCH orders. The
initial state of the UL\_CLTD\_Active follows the definition in clause
10.

Two separate transport blocks are transmitted via two independent
spatial streams when rank-2 transmission is used. The data rates on each
stream can be independently adapted. The number of HARQ processes in
dual stream operation is double of that in single stream operation, and
two E-HICH signature sequences are allocated, providing HARQ-ACK
feedback for each stream independently.

Rank-2 transmissions are only possible when the UL\_CLTD\_Active = 1.

The pre-coded physical channels structure for UL MIMO rank-2
transmission is depicted in Figure 9. When UL\_MIMO\_Enabled is TRUE
either single or dual-stream transmissions can take place. In case of
single stream (rank-1) transmission, the transport block is carried over
E-DPDCH(s) as in UL CLTD. In case of dual stream (rank-2) transmission,
the primary transport block is carried over 4 E-DPDCHs and the secondary
transport block is carried over 4 S-E-DPDCHs. S-E-DPCCH is used to
indicate the transport block size and retransmission sequence number of
the secondary transport block on S-E-DPDCH. S-E-DPCCH is I/Q multiplexed
with E-DPCCH and transmitted on primary pre-coding vector. S-E-DPCCH is
only sent with rank-2 transmissions. Both the E-DPDCHs and the
S-E-DPDCHs are always sent with 2xSF2 + 2xSF4 code combination for
rank-2 transmission. The UE can be configured with uplink MIMO only with
2 ms TTI on E-DCH.

For dual stream transmissions the following applies on setting the
relative transmit powers of the uplink physical channels:

> \- For the calculation of the E-DPCCH gain factors, E-DPCCH boosting
> is always applied regardless of the selected E-TFC to be transmitted,
>
> \- The S-DPCCH gain factor equals the E-DPCCH gain factor,
>
> \- The S-E-DPCCH gain factor is configured by higher layers.

UL MIMO rank-1 transmission and the setting of the channel transmit
powers function as defined for UL CLTD. The pre-coded physical channels
structure for UL MIMO rank-1 transmission is depicted in Figure 10.

Figure 9: Pre-coded physical channel structure of UL MIMO with rank-2
transmission

Figure 10: Pre-coded physical channel structure of UL MIMO with rank-1
transmission

11.1 General procedure
----------------------

The UE transmits two orthogonal pilot signals on DPCCH and S-DPCCH. Node
B estimates the preferred rank, precoding vector and S-ETFC Offset of
the two streams from the received pilot signals. The Node B transmits
the preferred precoding vector to the UE in the form of TPI bits using
the F-TPICH as in UL CLTD. The UE applies TPI as with UL CLTD. The
preferred rank and S-ETFC Offset to be applied by the UE E-TFC selection
are signalled to the UE using the E-ROCH channel.

Rank-1 transmissions occur if the maximum rank signalled over the E-ROCH
is 1, or if the UE does not have sufficient data or power headroom to
transmit at least the *Minimum E-TFCI for Rank 2 transmission* sized
transport blocks on both streams. *Minimum E-TFCI for Rank 2
transmission* is configured by higher layers.

The signal after spreading is fed to both TX antenna branches and
weighted with pre-coding weights *w~1~*, *w~2~*, *w~3~* and *w~4~*. The
same pre-coding weights, *w~1~* and *w~2~* are always applied to DPCCH,
DPCCH2, E-DPCCH, E-DPDCH, HS-DPCCH and S-E-DPCCH. The S-DPCCH and
S-E-DPDCH are pre-coded with pre-coding weights *w~3~* and *w~4~*.

11.2 Downlink TPI transmission and control timing
-------------------------------------------------

When uplink MIMO is configured, downlink TPI transmission and control
timing follows that defined for UL CLTD as defined in subclause 10.2.

11.3 Combining TPI bits from radio links of the serving radio link set
----------------------------------------------------------------------

When uplink MIMO is configured, combining TPI bits follows that defined
for UL CLTD as defined in subclause 10.3.

11.4 Operation during discontinuous uplink DPCCH operation
----------------------------------------------------------

When uplink MIMO is configured, operation during discontinuous uplink
DPCCH operation follows that defined for UL CLTD as defined in subclause
10.4.

11.5 Operation during compressed mode
-------------------------------------

When uplink MIMO is configured, operation during compressed mode follows
that defined for UL CLTD as defined in subclause 10.5.

11.6 HS-SCCH orders
-------------------

When uplink MIMO is configured, the HS-SCCH orders as defined for UL
CLTD operation in subclause 10.6 apply.

11.7 Uplink power control
-------------------------

When uplink MIMO is configured, the inner loop power control operates
without modifications as defined for non-MIMO operation.

12 MIMO operation of HS-DSCH with four transmit antennas
========================================================

This section applies only when a UE is configured in MIMO mode with four
transmit antennas.

The general transmitter structure to support MIMO operation of HS-PDSCH
transmission with four transmit antennas is shown in Figure 11. For each
transport block channel coding, interleaving, spreading and scrambling
are done as in non-MIMO mode. Symbol level interleaving between symbols
modulated from the primary and the fourth transport blocks is applied.
Similarly, symbol level interleaving between symbols modulated from the
second and the third transport block. The detailed operation for symbol
level interleaving is descried in subclause 12.2. The Node B scheduler
can decide to transmit one or two or three or four transport blocks to a
UE in one TTI in the serving HS-DSCH cell. The spread complex valued
signals are fed to all TX antenna branches, and weighted with precoding
weights *w~mn,\ ~*where m = 0,1,2,3, and n = 0 to number of transport
blocks decided. The precoding weights *w~mn\ ~* is the m^th^ row and
n^th^ column of the precoding matrix $W_{n}^{\left\{ s \right\}}$
defined in Table 14B.7 of \[2\]. The Node B can dynamically schedule the
UE with one or two or three or four transport blocks.

Figure 11: The generic downlink transmitter structure to support MIMO
mode with four transmit antennas operation for HS-PDSCH transmission.

12.1 General procedure
----------------------

The UE uses the CPICH to separately estimate the channels seen from each
antenna. One of the antennas will transmit the Antenna 1 modulation
pattern of the P-CPICH as defined in subclause 5.3.3.1 of \[1\]. The
other antennas will transmit the Antenna 1 modulation pattern of a
S-CPICH. If D-CPICHs are activated, the Antenna 3 and Antenna 4 will
transmit the Antenna 1 modulation pattern of a D-CPICH within TTIs in
which the HS-PDSCH is scheduled for a UE configured for MIMO mode with 4
transmit antennas. If D-CPICHs are activated, in addition to P-CPICH and
S-CPICHs, the UE uses the D-CPICHs as additional phase references on
antenna 3 and antenna 4 to estimate the channels for the HS-PDSCH
demodulation. The Pilot configuration in support of MIMO mode with four
transmit antennas operation of HS-DSCH in the cell is signalled by
higher layers.

The UE determines number of transport block preferred a preferred
precoding matrix and signals it to the Node B. The signalled information
about the number of transport block preferred (NTBP) also called rank
information (RI), preferred precoding matrix is termed precoding control
indication (PCI) and is defined in subclause 6A.4.2. The PCI is
signalled to the Node B together with channel quality indication (CQI)
and number of transport block preferred (NTBP) as a composite NTBP/
PCI/CQI report according to the procedure defined in subclause 6A.1.2.3.
The UE transmits the composite NTBP/PCI/CQI report to the Node B using
the CQI field on the HS-DPCCH as defined in \[1\]. Based on the
composite NTBP/PCI/CQI reports, the Node B scheduler decides whether to
schedule one, two, three or four transport blocks in a cell to a UE in
one TTI and what transport block size(s) and modulation scheme(s) to use
for each of them.

The Node B signals to the UE the transport blocks scheduled, the
precoding weights applied on the HS-PDSCH sub-frame using the precoding
weight indication bits of part 1 of the corresponding HS-SCCH sub-frame.
The precoding weight adjustment of each HS-PDSCH is done at the HS-PDSCH
sub-frame border. For an UE with dual stream capability the Node B
should not schedule more than two transport blocks.

12.2 Symbol level interleaving
------------------------------

Symbol level interleaving is applied between symbols modulated from the
second and the third transport block when the Node B schedules three
transport blocks. Symbol level interleaving is applied between symbols
modulated from the primary and the fourth transport blocks, similarly
between symbols modulated from the second and the third transport block
when the Node B schedules four transport blocks. Table 11 shows the
operation of symbol level interleaving, where x^(p)^ (i) and y^(p)^ (i),
p = 0,1,2 and 3 are the symbol interleaver input and output symbols
respectivelyrepectively.

Table 11: Operation of symbol level interleaving

  -------------------------------- --------------------------------------
  **Number of transport blocks**   **Symbol level interleaving output**
  1                                
  2                                
  3                                
  4                                
  -------------------------------- --------------------------------------

12.3 Retransmission Procedures
------------------------------

If the Node B schedules three transport blocks in any transmission, for
retransmissions the second transport block and the third transport block
are re-transmitted with the same HARQ process identifier as defined in
\[2\]. If the Node B schedules four transport blocks in any

fourth transport blocks are re-transmitted with the same HARQ process
identifier as defined in \[2\], retransmissions the second transport
block and the third transport block are re-transmitted with the same

\- If the Node B schedules two or three transport blocks, the transport

and if X~rvpb~ is set to 0, then the primary transport block is not
transmitted.

and if the transport block size information of the primary transport
block is equal to '111111' the UE shall discard the received data on the

had been successfully decoded and generate a positive acknowledgement
for the primary transport block in this HARQ process. Node B should
assume positive acknowledgement has been received for this HARQ process.

the primary and the fourth transport blocks had been successfully
decoded and generate a positive acknowledgement for the primary and the

positive acknowledgement has been received for this HARQ process.

12.4 Precoding weight restriction
---------------------------------

A UE is restricted to report PCI, and NTBP within a precoder codebook
subset specified by a bitmap parameter *PrecodingWeightRestriction*
configured by higher layer signalling. The bitmap can specify all
possible precoder codebook subsets from which the UE can assume the Node
B may be using when the UE is configured in MIMO mode with four transmit
antennas. The bitmap forms the bit sequence
$a_{\text{63}},\text{.}\text{.}\text{.},a_{3},a_{2},a_{1},a_{0}$where
$a_{0}$ is the LSB and $a_{\text{63}}$is the MSB and where a bit value
of zero indicates that the precoding indices reporting is not allowed in
the NTBP/PCI/CQI report.

12.5 HS-SCCH Orders
-------------------

The Node B may activate or deactivate D-CPICH on 3^rd^ and 4^th^
antennas through HS-SCCH orders as described in \[2\]. The UE may assume
that D-CPICHs are present 12 slots after the end of the HS-SCCH subframe
containing the order for activation of D-CPICHs. The UE is not required
to perform any operations based on the D-CPICHs 12 slots after the end
of the HS-SCCH subframe containing the order for deactivation. The
HS-SCCH order for activation or deactivation of D-CPICHs is UE-specific.

The UE can assume the initial activation status of D-CPICH as set by the
network through RRC signalling.

######## Annex A (informative): (no title) 

A.1 Antenna verification
------------------------

In closed loop mode 1, if channel estimates are taken from the Primary
CPICH, the performance will also suffer if the UE cannot detect errors
since the channel estimates will be taken for the incorrect phase
settings. To mitigate this problem, antenna verification can be done,
which can make use of antenna specific pilot patterns of the dedicated
physical channel. The antenna verification can be implemented with
several different algorithms. A straightforward algorithm can use a
4-hypothesis test per slot. Alternatively, a simplified beam former
verification (SBV) requiring only a 2-hypothesis test per slot can be
used.

Consider

$2\sum_{i = 1}^{\text{Npath}}\frac{1}{\sigma_{i}^{2}}\left\{ \sqrt{2}\text{Re}(\text{γh}_{2,i}^{(d)}h_{2,i}^{{(p)}^{}}) \right\} > \text{ln}\left( \frac{\overline{p}(\varphi_{\text{Rx}} = \pi)}{\overline{p}(\varphi_{\text{Rx}} = 0)} \right)$

Then define the variable x~0~ as 0 if the above inequality holds good
and x~0~ = π otherwise.

Similarly consider

then define the variable x~1~ as -π/2 if the above inequality holds good
and x~1~ = π/2 oherwise.

Whether x~0~ or x~1~ is to be calculated for each slot is given by the
following table , where the first row contains the UL slot index of the
feedback bit to be verified.

  ---- ------ ------ ------ ------ ------ ------ ------ ------ ------ ------ ------ ------ ------ ------ ------
  UL   0      1      2      3      4      5      6      7      8      9      10     11     12     13     14
       x~0~   x~1~   x~0~   x~1~   x~0~   x~1~   x~0~   x~1~   x~0~   x~1~   x~0~   x~1~   x~0~   x~1~   x~0~
  ---- ------ ------ ------ ------ ------ ------ ------ ------ ------ ------ ------ ------ ------ ------ ------

The estimate for the transmitted phase is now obtained from

$\text{sin}(\varphi_{\text{Tx}}) + j\text{cos}(\varphi_{\text{Tx}}) = \frac{\sum_{i = 0}^{1}{\text{sin}(x_{i})}}{\sqrt{2}} + j\frac{\sum_{i = 0}^{1}{\text{cos}(x_{i})}}{\sqrt{2}}$

where:

\- the x~i~ ­values are used corresponding to the current slot and the
previous slot taking into account the end-of-frame adjustment and the
used CL timing adjustment delay

\- $h_{2,i}^{(p)}$is the *i*\'th estimated channel tap of antenna 2
using the CPICH;

\- $h_{2,i}^{(d)}$is the *i*\'th estimated channel tap of antenna 2
using the DPCCH;

− γ*^2^* is the DPCH Pilot SNIR/ CPICH SNIR;

\- $\sigma_{i}^{2}$is the noise plus interference power on the *i*\'th
path.

In normal operation the *a priori* probability for selected pilot
pattern is assumed to be 96% (assuming there are 4% of errors in the
feedback channel for power control and antenna selection).

A.2 Computation of feedback information for closed loop mode 1 transmit diversity
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In non-soft handover case, the computation of feedback information can
be accomplished by e.g. solving for weight vector, *[w,]{.underline}*
that maximises.

*P=[w]{.underline}^H^H^H^H[w]{.underline}* (1)

where

H=\[*[h]{.underline}~1~* *[h]{.underline}~2~*\] and [w]{.underline} = \[
w~1~, w~2~ \]^T^

and where the column vectors *[h]{.underline}~1~* and
*[h]{.underline}~2~* represent the estimated channel impulse responses
for the transmission antennas 1 and 2, of length equal to the length of
the channel impulse response. The elements of [w]{.underline} correspond
to the adjustments computed by the UE.

During soft handover, the antenna weight vector, *[w]{.underline}* can
be, for example, determined so as to maximise the criteria function:

*P* = [w]{.underline}^H^(H~1~^H^H~1~+ H~2~^H^H~2~+⋅⋅⋅⋅)[w]{.underline}
(2)

where *H~i~* is an estimated channel impulse response for BS\#i. In
regular SHO, the set of BS\#i corresponds to the active set.

If HS-PDSCH is present, the UE may emphasize the HS-PDSCH serving cell.
In this case the antenna weight vector, *[w]{.underline}* can be, for
example, determined so as to maximise the criteria function:

*P* = [w]{.underline}^H^(α(H~1~^H^H~1~)+
(1-α)(H~2~^H^H~2~+⋅⋅⋅⋅))[w]{.underline}

where BS\#1 is the HS-PDSCH serving cell and coefficient α is less than
or equal to 1. For example α = 0.7 enhances HS-DSCH performance while
ensuring that there is only a small degradation on the DPCH.

######## Annex B (Informative): Power control

B.1 Downlink power control timing
=================================

The power control timing described in this annex should be seen as an
example on how the control bits have to be placed in order to permit a
short TPC delay.

In order to maximise the cell radius distance within which one-slot
control delay is achieved, the frame timing of an uplink DPCH is delayed
by 1024 chips from that of the corresponding downlink DPCH measured at
the UE antenna.

Responding to a downlink TPC command, the UE shall change its uplink
DPCH output power at the beginning of the first uplink pilot field after
the TPC command reception. Responding to an uplink TPC command, the
UTRAN access point shall change its DPCH output power at the beginning
of the next downlink pilot field after the reception of the whole TPC
command. Note that in soft handover, the TPC command is sent over one
slot when DPC\_MODE is 0 and over three slots when DPC\_MODE is 1. Note
also that the delay from the uplink TPC command reception to the power
change timing is not specified for UTRAN. The UE shall decide and send
TPC commands on the uplink based on the downlink SIR measurement. For
the DPCH, the TPC command field on the uplink starts, when measured at
the UE antenna, 512 chips after the end of the downlink pilot field. The
UTRAN access point shall decide and send TPC commands based on the
uplink SIR measurement. However, the SIR measurement periods are not
specified either for UE nor UTRAN.

Figure B.1 illustrates an example of transmitter power control timings
when a DPCH is configured on the downlink, with a slot format that
contains pilot bits.

Figure B.1: Transmitter power control timing for DPCH when downlink DPCH
slot format contains pilot bits

Figure B.1A illustrates an example of transmitter power control timings
when a DPCH is configured on the downlink, with a slot format that does
not contain pilot bits.

Figure B.1A: Transmitter power control timing for DPCH when downlink
DPCH slot format does not contain pilot bits

Figure B.2 illustrates an example of transmitter power control timings
when the F-DPCH is configured on the downlink and the F-DPCH TPC offset
N~OFF1~ of all the radio links in the RLS is 0 or 2(see Table 16C of
\[1\]). Figure B.2a illustrates an example of transmitter power control
timings for the radio link whose F-DPCH TPC offset N~OFF1~ = 0 or 2,
when the F-DPCH is configured on the downlink, and the F-DPCH TPC offset
N~OFF1~ of at least one other radio link in the RLS is \> 2. Figure B.3
illustrates an example of transmitter power control timings when the
F-DPCH is configured on the downlink and the F-DPCH TPC offset N~OFF1~
of the radio link is larger than 2. Figure B.4 illustrates an example of
transmitter power control timings when the F-DPCH is configured on the
downlink and the F-DPCH TPC offset N~OFF1~ of the radio link is larger
than 14 when uplink DPCCH slot format \#4 is used.

offset N~OFF1~ larger than 2

Figure B.4: Transmitter power control timing for F-DPCH with a TPC

B.2 Example of implementation in the UE
=======================================

The downlink inner-loop power control adjusts the network transmit power
in order to keep the received downlink SIR at a given SIR target,
SIR~target~. A higher layer outer loop adjusts SIR~target~ independently
for each connection.

The UE should estimate the received downlink DPCCH/DPDCH power of the
connection to be power controlled. Simultaneously, the UE should
estimate the received interference and calculate the
signal-to-interference ratio, SIR~est~. SIR~est~ can be calculated as
RSCP/ISCP, where RSCP refers to the received signal code power on one
code and ISCP refers to the non-orthogonal interference signal code
power of the received signal on one code. Note that due to the specific
SIR target offsets described in \[5\] that can be applied during
compressed frames, the spreading factor shall not be considered in the
calculation of SIR~est~.

The obtained SIR estimate SIR~est~ is then used by the UE to generate
TPC commands according to the following rule: if SIR~est~ \> SIR~target~
then the TPC command to transmit is \"0\", requesting a transmit power
decrease, while if SIR~est~ \< SIR~target~ then the TPC command to
transmit is \"1\", requesting a transmit power increase.

When the UE is in soft handover, the UE should estimate SIR~est~ from
the downlink signals of all cells in the active set.

B.3 UL power control when losing UL synchronization
===================================================

Each Node B operates the uplink power control independently of the other
Node Bs that may be providing RLS to the same UE. In case of multiple
RLS the UE derives the decision on power adjustment based on all the
commands received according the rules specified in subclause 5.1.2. In
this scenario, transmission of a down command by one or more of the
involved Node Bs will likely result in the UE decreasing its transmit
power.

Consequently, if and when, after successful initial RL synchronization,
the Node B loses UL synchronization for a UE and if the current number
of RLS configured for that UE is greater than one and if the Node B
reverts to a TPC pattern in such situation (i.e. generates DL TPC
commands independently of actual RL measurements), the Node B should not
use TPC commands "0" in the TPC pattern.

######## Annex C (Informative): Cell search procedure

During the cell search, the UE searches for a cell and determines the
downlink scrambling code and frame synchronization of that cell. The
cell search is typically carried out in three steps:

##### Step 1: Slot synchronization {#step-1-slot-synchronization .H6}

During the first step of the cell search procedure the UE uses the SCH's
primary synchronization code to acquire slot synchronization to a cell.
This is typically done with a single matched filter (or any similar
device) matched to the primary synchronization code which is common to
all cells. The slot timing of the cell can be obtained by detecting
peaks in the matched filter output.

##### Step 2: Frame synchronization and code-group identification {#step-2-frame-synchronization-and-code-group-identification .H6}

During the second step of the cell search procedure, the UE uses the
SCH's secondary synchronization code to find frame synchronization and
identify the code group of the cell found in the first step. This is
done by correlating the received signal with all possible secondary
synchronization code sequences, and identifying the maximum correlation
value. Since the cyclic shifts of the sequences are unique the code
group as well as the frame synchronization is determined.

##### Step 3: Scrambling-code identification {#step-3-scrambling-code-identification .H6}

During the third and last step of the cell search procedure, the UE
determines the exact primary scrambling code used by the found cell. The
primary scrambling code is typically identified through symbol-by-symbol
correlation over the CPICH with all codes within the code group
identified in the second step. After the primary scrambling code has
been identified, the Primary CCPCH can be detected. And the system- and
cell specific BCH information can be read.

If the UE has received information about which scrambling codes to
search for, steps 2 and 3 above can be simplified.

######## Annex D (Informative): F-TPICH Transmission

The F-TPICH transmission timing described in this annex should be seen
as an example on how the TPI bits have to be placed in order to ensure a
short TPI delay.

In response to the reception of the TPI bits on the F-TPICH channel, the
UE shall apply the precoding weights indicated by the TPI bits at the
first UL DPCCH slot that is transmitted at least 512 bits after the
reception of the last of the two TPI symbols. The reliability of the
received TPI bit is determined by the UE based on the downlink SIR
measurement on the F-TPICH channel.

Figure D.1 illustrates an example of F-TPICH timing for UL CLTD
operation when the F-TPICH frame starts 512 chips after the start of the
DPCH/F-DPCH frame.
