1 Scope
=======

The present document specifies the Radio Frequency (RF) test methods and
conformance requirements for UTRA Base Stations (BS) operating in the
TDD mode. These have been derived from, and are consistent with, the
UTRA base station (BS) specifications defined in 3GPP TS 25.105 \[1\].
The document covers all three options of the TDD mode, which are the
3,84 Mcps (incorporating MBSFN IMB), the 1,28 Mcps and the 7.68 Mcps
options respectively. The requirements are listed in different
subsections only if the parameters deviate.

In this TS, the reference point for RF connections (except for the
measurement of mean transmitted RF carrier power) is the antenna
connector, as defined by the manufacturer. This TS does not apply to
repeaters or RF devices which may be connected to an antenna connector
of a BS.

3 Definitions, symbols, and abbreviations
=========================================

3.1 Definitions
---------------

**Ancillary RF amplifier:** a piece of equipment, which when connected
by RF coaxial cables to the BS, has the primary function to provide
amplification between the transmit and/or receive antenna connector of a
BS and an antenna without requiring any control signal to fulfil its
amplifying function.

**BS RF bandwidth**: The bandwidth in which a Base Station
**simultaneously** transmits and/or **simultaneously** receives multiple
carriers within each supported operating band.

**BS RF bandwidth edge:** The frequency of one of the edges of the Base
Station RF bandwidth

**Bit Error Ratio:** The Bit Error Ratio is defined as the ratio of the
bits wrongly received to all data bits sent. The bits are the data bits
above the convolutional/turbo decoder. The BER is the overall BER
independent of frame erasures or when erased frames are not defined.

**Block Error Ratio:** A Block Error Ratio is defined as the ratio of
the number of erroneous blocks received to the total number of blocks
sent. An erroneous block is a Transport Block whose cyclic redundancy
check (CRC) is wrong.

**Power Spectral Density: The units of Power Spectral Density (PSD) are
extensively used in this document. PSD is a function of power versus
frequency and when integrated across a given bandwidth, the function
represents the mean power in such a bandwidth. When the mean power is
normalised to (divided by) the chip-rate it represents the mean energy
per chip. Some signals are directly defined in terms of energy per chip,
(DPCH\_Ec, Ec, and P-CCPCH\_Ec) and others defined in terms of PSD (Io,
Ioc, Ior and Îor). There also exist quantities that are a ratio of
energy per chip to PSD (DPCH\_Ec/Ior, Ec/Ior etc.). This is the common
practice of relating energy magnitudes in communication systems.**

**It can be seen that if both energy magnitudes in the ratio are divided
by time, the ratio is converted from an energy ratio to a power ratio,
which is more useful from a measurement point of view. It follows that
an energy per chip of X dBm/3,84 MHz can be expressed as a mean power
per chip of X dBm. Similarly, a signal PSD of Y dBm/3,84 MHz can be
expressed as a signal power of Y dBm.**

**Mean power:** When applied to a CDMA modulated signal this is the
power (transmitted or received) in a bandwidth of at least (1+ α) times
the chip rate of the radio access mode. The period of measurement shall
be a transmit timeslot excluding the guard period unless otherwise
stated.

NOTE: The roll-off factor α is defined in section 6.8.1.

**RRC filtered mean power:** The mean power as measured through a root
raised cosine filter with roll-off factor α and a bandwidth equal to the
chip rate of the radio access mode.

NOTE: The RRC filtered mean power of a perfectly modulated CDMA signal
is 0.246 dB lower than the mean power of the same signal.

**Code domain power:** That part of the mean power which correlates with
a particular (OVSF) code channel. The sum of all powers in the code
domain equals the mean power in a bandwidth of (1+ α) times the chip
rate of the radio access mode.

**Highest Carrier:** The carrier with the highest carrier centre
frequency transmitted/received in a specified operating band**.**

**Inter RF bandwidth gap:** The frequency gap between two consecutive RF
bandwidths that are placed within two supported operating bands
respectively.

**Multi-band Base Station:** Base Station characterized by the ability
of its transmitter and/or receiver to process two or more carriers in
common active RF components simultaneously, where at least one carrier
is configured at a different non-overlapping operating band than the
other carrier(s).

**Multi-band transmitter:** Transmitter characterized by the ability to
process two or more carriers in common active RF components
simultaneously, where at least one carrier is configured at a different
non-overlapping operating band than the other carrier(s).

**Multi-band receiver:** Receiver characterized by the ability to
process two or more carriers in common active RF components
simultaneously, where at least one carrier is configured at a different
non-overlapping operating band than the other carrier(s).

**Maximum radio bandwidth:** **Maximum frequency difference between the
upper edge of the highest used carrier and the lower edge of the lowest
used carrier.**

**Maximum BS RF bandwidth:** The maximum RF bandwidth supported by a BS
within each supported operating band.

**Output power, Pout:** The mean power of one carrier of the base
station, delivered to a load with resistance equal to the nominal load
impedance of the transmitter.

**Lower RF bandwidth edge:** The frequency of the lower of the Base
station RF bandwidth, used as a frequency reference point for
transmitter and receiver requirements.

**Lowest Carrier:** The carrier with the lowest carrier centre frequency
transmitted/received in a specified operating band.

**Maximum output power, Pmax:** The mean power level per carrier of the
base station measured at the antenna connector in a specified reference
condition. The period of measurement shall be a transmit timeslot
excluding the guard period.

**MBSFN-only operation:** Operation of a dedicated carrier solely for
the purposes of MBSFN transmission. *No receive functionality is
implemented on the specified carrier frequency.*

**Rated output power, PRAT:** Rated output power of the base station is
the mean power level per carrier that the manufacturer has declared to
be available at the antenna connector.

**Rated total output power:** Rated total output power of the base
station is the mean power level that the manufacturer has declared to be
available at the antenna connector.

**Synchronized operation:** Operation of TDD in two different systems,
where no simultaneous uplink and downlink occur.

**Total power dynamic range:** The difference between the maximum and
the minimum output power of the base station for a specified reference
condition.

**Total RF bandwidth**: Maximum sum of RF bandwidths in all supported
operating bands.

**Upper RF bandwidth edge:** The frequency of the upper edge of the Base
Station RF Bandwidth; used as a frequency reference point for
transmitter and receiver requirements.

**Unsynchronized operation:** Operation of TDD in two different systems,
where the conditions for synchronized operation are not met.

4 Frequency bands and channel arrangement
=========================================

4.1 General
-----------

The information presented in this section is based on a chip rate of
3,84 Mcps, 1,28 Mcps respectively and 7.68 Mcps .

NOTE: Other chip rates may be considered in future releases.

4.2 Frequency bands
-------------------

UTRA/TDD is designed to operate in the following bands:

a\) 1900 - 1920 MHz: Uplink and downlink transmission

2010 - 2025 MHz Uplink and downlink transmission

b\) 1850 - 1910 MHz: Uplink and downlink transmission

1930 - 1990 MHz: Uplink and downlink transmission

c\) 1910 - 1930 MHz: Uplink and downlink transmission

d\) 2570 - 2620 MHz Uplink and downlink transmission

e\) 2300 - 2400 MHz Uplink and downlink transmission

f\) 1880 - 1920 MHz: Uplink and downlink transmission

Note 1: Deployment in existing and other frequency bands is not
precluded.

Note 2: In China, Band a only includes 2010 - 2025 MHz for 1.28 Mcps TDD
option.

4.3 TX-RX frequency separation
------------------------------

### 4.3.1 3,84 Mcps TDD option

No TX-RX frequency separation is required as Time Division Duplex (TDD)
is employed. Each TDMA frame consists of 15 timeslots where each
timeslot can be allocated to either transmit or receive.

### 4.3.2 1,28 Mcps TDD option

No TX-RX frequency separation is required as Time Division Duplex (TDD)
is employed. Each subframe consists of 7 main timeslots where all main
timeslots (at least the first one) before the single switching point are
allocated UL and all main timeslots (at least the last one) after the
single switching point are allocated DL.

### 4.3.3 7,68 Mcps TDD option

No TX-RX frequency separation is required as Time Division Duplex (TDD)
is employed. Each TDMA frame consists of 15 timeslots where each
timeslot can be allocated to either transmit or receive.

4.4 Channel arrangement
-----------------------

### 4.4.1 Channel spacing

#### 4.4.1.1 3,84 Mcps TDD option

The nominal channel spacing is 5 MHz, but this can be adjusted to
optimise performance in a particular deployment scenario.

#### 4.4.1.2 1,28 Mcps TDD option

The nominal channel spacing is 1,6 MHz, but this can be adjusted to
optimise performance in a particular deployment scenario.

#### 4.4.1.3 7,68 Mcps TDD option

The nominal channel spacing is 10 MHz, but this can be adjusted to
optimise performance in a particular deployment scenario.

### 4.4.2 Channel raster

The channel raster is 200 kHz for all bands, which means that the
carrier frequency must be a multiple of 200 kHz.

#### 4.4.2.1 3,84 Mcps TDD Option

In addition a number of additional centre frequencies are specified
according to table 5.1, which means that the centre frequencies for
these channels are shifted 100 kHz relative to the general raster.

### 4.4.3 Channel number

The carrier frequency is designated by the UTRA absolute radio frequency
channel number (UARFCN). The value of the UARFCN in the IMT2000 band is
defined in the general case as follows:

N~t~ = 5 ∗ F MHz 0,0 ≤ F ≤ 3276,6 MHz

where F is the carrier frequency in MHz.

Additional channels applicable to operation in the frequency band
defined in sub-clause 5.2(d) for 3,84 Mcps are defined via the following
UARFCN definition:

N~t~ = 5 \* (F - 2150.1 MHz) 2572.5 MHz ≤ F≤ 2617.5 MHz

The 10 additional UARFCN for operations in frequency band defined in
sub-clause 5.2(d) for 3,84 Mcps are hence: 2112, 2137, 2162, 2187, 2212,
2237, 2262, 2287, 2312, 2337.

5 General test conditions and declarations
==========================================

Many of the tests in this TS measure a parameter relative to a value
that is not fully specified in the UTRA specifications. For these tests,
the Minimum Requirement is determined relative to a nominal value
specified by the manufacturer.

Certain functions of a BS are optional in the UTRA specifications. Some
requirements for the BS may be regional as listed in subclause 5.17.

When specified in a test, the manufacturer shall declare the nominal
value of a parameter, or whether an option is supported.

5.1 Base station classes
------------------------

### 5.1.1 Applicability of requirements and BS class definition 

The requirements in this specification apply to Wide Area base stations,
Local Area base stations and Home Base Stations in co-ordinated network
operation, unless otherwise stated.

Wide Area BS are characterised by requirements derived from Macro Cell
and Micro Cell scenarios with BS to UE coupling losses equal to 70 dB
and 53 dB. The Wide Area Base Station has the same requirements as the
base station for General Purpose application in Release 99 for 3,84 Mcps
option, and in release 4 for both 3,84 Mcps and 1,28 Mcps option.

Local Area BS are characterised by requirements derived from Pico Cell
scenarios with a BS to UE coupling loss equals to 45 dB.

Home Base Stations are characterised by requirements derived from Femto
Cell scenarios.

### 5.1.2 Manufacturer's declaration of supported RF configurations

The manufacturer shall declare which operational configurations the BS
supports by declaring the following parameters:

\- The intended class of the BS under test according to clause 5.1.1

\- The supported operating bands defined in clause 4.2;

\- The frequency range within the above operating band(s) supported by
the BS;

\- The maximum Base Station RF bandwidth supported by a BS within each
operating band;

\- The supported operating configurations (multi-carrier and/or single
carrier) within each operating band;

\- The rated output power per carrier, PRAT;

\- The rated total output power as a sum of all carriers;

\- Maximum number of supported carriers within each band;

\- Total number of supported carriers

If the rated total output power and total number of supported carriers
are not simultaneously supported, the manufacturer shall declare the
following additional parameters:

\- The reduced number of supported carriers at the rated total output
power;

\- The reduced total output power at the maximum number of supported
carriers.

For BS capable of multi-band operation, the parameters above shall be
declared for each supported operating band in single-band operation. In
addition the manufacturer shall declare the following additional
parameters for BS capable of multi-band operation:

\- Supported operating band combinations of the BS

\- Supported operating band(s) of each antenna connector

\- Support of multi-band transmitter and/or multi-band receiver,
including mapping to antenna connector(s)

\- Total number of supported carriers for the declared band combinations
of the BS

\- Maximum number of supported carriers per band in multi-band operation

\- Total RF bandwidth of transmitter and receiver for the declared band
combinations of the BS

\- Maximum RF bandwidth of each supported operating band in multi-band
operation

\- Maximum radio bandwidth in transmit and receive direction for the
declared band combinations of the BS

\- Any other limitations under simultaneous operation in the declared
band combinations of the BS which have any impact on the test
configuration generation

\- Total output power as a sum over all supported operating bands in the
declared band combinations of the BS

\- Maximum supported power difference between any two carriers in any
two different supported operating bands

\- The rated output power per carrier in multi-band operation

\- Rated total output power of each supported operating band in
multi-band operation.

5.2 Output power
----------------

Void

5.3 Specified frequency range and supported channel bandwidth
-------------------------------------------------------------

The manufacturer shall declare:

\- which of the frequency bands defined in sub-clause 4.2 are supported
by the BS.

\- the frequency range within the above frequency band(s) supported by
the BS. As TDD is employed, the same frequency range is used for
transmit and receive operation. For the case of MBSFN-only operation,
the frequency range is used for transmit only, since no receive
requirement exists.

For the single carrier testing, many tests in this TS are performed with
appropriate frequencies in the bottom, middle and top of the operating
frequency band of the BS. These are denoted as RF channels B (bottom), M
(middle) and T (top).

Unless otherwise stated, the test shall be performed with a single
carrier at each of the RF channels B, M and T.

When a test is performed by a test laboratory, the UARFCNs to be used
for RF channels B, M and T shall be specified by the laboratory. The
laboratory may consult with operators, the manufacturer or other bodies.

When a test is performed by a manufacturer, the UARFCNs to be used for
RF channels B, M and T may be specified by an operator.

### 5.3.1 RF bandwidth position for multi-carrier testing

Many tests in this TS are performed with the maximum RF bandwidth
located at the bottom, middle and top of the supported frequency range
in each operating band. These are denoted as B~RFBW~(bottom), M~RFBW~
(middle) and T~RFBW~ (top).

Unless otherwise stated, the test shall be performed at B~RFBW~, M~RFBW~
and T~RFBW~ defined as following:

\- B~RFBW~: maximum RF bandwidth located at the bottom of the supported
frequency range in each operating band;

\- M~RFBW~: maximum RF bandwidth located in the middle of the supported
frequency range in each operating band;

\- T~RFBW~: maximum RF bandwidth located at the top of the supported
frequency range in each operating band.

For BS capable of dual-band operation, unless otherwise stated, the test
shall be performed at B~RFBW~\_T'~RFBW~ and B'~RFBW~\_T~RFBW~ defined as
following:

B~RFBW~\_ T\'~RFBW~: the RF bandwidths located at the bottom of the
supported frequency range in the lower operating band and at the highest
possible simultaneous frequency position, within the maximum radio
bandwidth, in the upper operating band.

B\'~RFBW~\_T~RFBW:~ the RF bandwidths located at the top of the
supported frequency range in the upper operating band and at the lowest
possible simultaneous frequency position, within the maximum radio
bandwidth, in the lower operating band.

NOTE: B~RFBW~\_T'~RFBW~ = B'~RFBW~\_T~RFBW~ = B~RFBW~\_T~RFBW~ when the
declared maximum radio bandwidth spans both operating bands.
B~RFBW~\_T~RFBW~ means the RF bandwidths are located at the bottom of
the supported frequency range in the lower operating band and at the top
of the supported frequency range in the upper operating band.

When a test is performed by a test laboratory, the position of B~RFBW~,
M~RFBW~ and T~RFBW~ in each supported operating band, as well as the
position of B~RFBW~\_T'~RFBW~ and B'~RFBW~\_T~RFBW~ in the supported
operating band combinations, shall be specified by the laboratory. The
laboratory may consult with operators, the manufacturer or other bodies.

5.8 Blocking characteristics
----------------------------

The conformance requirements with respect to the parameter blocking
characteristics are dependent on the operating frequency bands of the BS
under test; see subclause 7.5.2. However, the need for a manufacturer\'s
declaration of the frequency bands supported by the BS is already
covered by subclause 5.3. The relationship between the frequency bands
supported by the BS and the mandatory blocking requirements is given in
table5.1.

5.9 Test environments
---------------------

For each test in this TS, the environmental conditions under which the
BS is to be tested are defined.

### 5.9.1 Normal test environment

When a normal test environment is specified for a test, the test should
be performed under any combination of conditions between the minimum and
maximum limits stated in table 5.2.

Table 5.2: Limits of conditions for Normal Test Environment

  --------------------- ------------------------------------------ ---------
  Condition             Minimum                                    Maximum
  Barometric pressure   86 kPa                                     106 kPa
  Temperature           15°C                                       30°C
  Relative Humidity     20 %                                       85 %

  Vibration             Negligible                                 
  --------------------- ------------------------------------------ ---------

The ranges of barometric pressure, temperature and humidity represent
the maximum variation expected in the uncontrolled environment of a test
laboratory. If it is not possible to maintain these parameters within
the specified limits, the actual values shall be recorded in the test
report.

NOTE: This may, for instance, be the case for measurements of radiated
emissions performed on an open field test site.

### 5.9.2 Extreme test environment

The manufacturer shall declare one of the following:

a\) The equipment class for the equipment under test, as defined in IEC
60721-3-3 \[2\].

b\) The equipment class for the equipment under test, as defined in IEC
60721-3-4 \[3\].

c\) For equipment that does not comply to the mentioned classes, the
relevant classes from IEC 60 721 documentation for Temperature, Humidity
and Vibration shall be declared.

NOTE: Reduced functionality for conditions that fall out side of the
standard operational conditions are not tested in this TS. These may be
stated and tested separately.

#### 5.9.2.1 Extreme temperature

When an extreme temperature test environment is specified for a test,
the test shall be performed at the standard minimum and maximum
operating temperatures defined by the manufacturer\'s declaration for
the equipment under test.

**Minimum temperature:**

\- The test shall be performed with the environmental test equipment and
methods of inducing the required environmental phenomena into the
equipment, conforming to the test procedure of IEC 60 068‑2‑1 \[4\],
Environmental Testing, Part 2: Tests ‑ Tests A: Cold. The equipment
shall be maintained at the stabilized condition for the duration of the
test sequence.

**Maximum temperature:**

\- The test shall be performed with the environmental test equipment and
methods of inducing the required environmental phenomena in to the
equipment, conforming to the test procedure of IEC 60 068‑2‑2 \[5\]
(Environmental Testing, Part 2: Tests ‑ Tests Bd Dry heat). The
equipment shall be maintained at the stabilized condition for the
duration of the test sequence.

NOTE: It is recommended that the equipment is made fully operational
prior to the equipment being taken to its lower operating temperature.

### 5.9.3 Vibration

When vibration conditions are specified for a test, the test shall be
performed while the equipment is subjected to a vibration sequence as
defined by the manufacturers declaration for the equipment under test.
This shall use the environmental test equipment and methods of inducing
the required environmental phenomena in to the equipment, conforming to
the test procedure of IEC 60 068‑2‑6 \[8\], Environmental Testing, Part
2: Tests ‑ Test Fc and guidance: Vibration (Sinusoidal). Other
environmental conditions shall be within the ranges specified in
subclause 5.9.1, Normal test environment.

NOTE: The higher levels of vibration may induce undue physical stress in
to equipment after a prolonged series of tests. The testing body should
only vibrate the equipment during the RF measurement process.

### 5.9.4 Power supply

When extreme power supply conditions are specified for a test, the test
shall be performed at the standard upper and lower limits of operating
voltage defined by the manufacturer\'s declaration for the equipment
under test.

**Upper voltage limit**

\- The equipment shall be supplied with a voltage equal to the upper
limit declared by the manufacturer (as measured at the input terminals
to the equipment). The tests shall be carried out at a steady state
minimum and maximum limit declared by the manufacturer for the
equipment, to the methods described in IEC 60 068‑2‑1 \[4\] Test Ab/Ad:
Cold and IEC 60 068‑2‑2 \[5\] Test Bb/Bd: Dry Heat.

**Lower voltage limit**

\- The equipment shall be supplied with a voltage equal to the lower
limit declared by the manufacturer (as measured at the input terminals
to the equipment). The tests shall be carried out at a steady state
minimum and maximum limit declared by the manufacturer for the
equipment, to the methods described in IEC 60 068‑2‑1 \[4\] Test Ab/Ad:
Cold and IEC 60 068‑2‑2 \[5\] Test Bb/Bd: Dry Heat.

### 5.10 Acceptable uncertainty of Test System

The maximum acceptable uncertainty of the Test System is specified below
for each test, where appropriate. The Test System shall enable the
stimulus signals in the test case to be adjusted to within the specified
tolerance and the equipment under test to be measured with an
uncertainty not exceeding the specified values. All tolerances and
uncertainties are absolute values and are valid for a confidence level
of 95 %, unless otherwise stated.

A confidence level of 95 % is the measurement uncertainty tolerance
interval for a specific measurement that contains 95 % of the
performance of a population of test equipment.

For RF tests it should be noted that the uncertainties in subclause 5.10
apply to the Test System operating into a nominal 50 ohm load and do not
include system effects due to mismatch between the DUT and the Test
System.

### 5.10.1 Measurement of test environments

The measurement accuracy of the BS test environments defined in
subclause 5.9 shall be:

> Pressure: ± 5 kPa
>
> Temperature: ± 2 degrees
>
> Relative Humidity: ± 5 %
>
> DC Voltage: ± 1,0 %
>
> AC Voltage: ± 1,5 %
>
> Vibration: 10 %
>
> Vibration frequency: 0,1 Hz

The above values shall apply unless the test environment is otherwise
controlled and the specification for the control of the test environment
specifies the uncertainty for the parameter.

### 5.11 Test Tolerances (informative)

The Test Tolerances defined in this subclause have been used to relax
the Minimum Requirements in this specification to derive the Test
Requirements.

The Test Tolerances are derived from Test System uncertainties,
regulatory requirements and criticality to system performance. As a
result, the Test Tolerance may sometimes be set to zero.

The test tolerances should not be modified for any reason, e. g. to take
account of commonly known test system errors (such as mismatch, cable
loss, etc.)

5.12 Interpretation of measurement results
------------------------------------------

The measurement results returned by the Test System are compared -
without any modification - against the Test Requirements as defined by
the shared risk principle.

The Shared Risk principle is defined in ITU-R M.1545 \[13\].

The actual measurement uncertainty of the Test System for the
measurement of each parameter shall be included in the test report.

The recorded value for theTest System uncertainty shall be, for each
measurement, equal to or lower than the appropriate figure in
subclause 5.10 of this TS.

If the Test System for a test is known to have a measurement uncertainty
greater than that specified in subclause 5.10, it is still permitted to
use this equipment provided that an adjustment is made as follows:

Any additional uncertainty in the Test System over and above that
specified in subclause 5.10 shall be used to tighten the Test
Requirement - making the test harder to pass. (For some tests, e. g.
receiver tests, this may require modification of stimulus signals).

This procedure (defined in Annex D) will ensure that a Test System not
compliant with subclause 5.10 does not increase the chance of passing a
device under test where that device would otherwise have failed the test
if a Test System compliant with subclause 5.10 had been used.

5.13 Selection of configurations for testing
--------------------------------------------

Measurements shall be performed within the time slots under test as
specified individually for each test within the subclause \"Initial
conditions\".

Most tests in this TS are only performed for a subset of the possible
combinations of test conditions. For instance:

‑ Not all TRXs in the configuration may be specified to be tested.

‑ Only one RF channel may be specified to be tested.

‑ Only one timeslot may be specified to be tested.

When a test is performed by a test laboratory, the choice of which
combinations are to be tested shall be specified by the laboratory. The
laboratory may consult with operators, the manufacturer or other bodies.

When a test is performed by a manufacturer, the choice of which
combinations are to be tested may be specified by an operator.

5.14 BS Configurations
----------------------

This TS has been written to specify tests for the standard
configurations of BS which have been assumed in UTRA requirements
specifications, in particular TS 25.105 \[1\]. However, there are other
configurations of BS which comply with these specifications, but for
which the application of these specifications is not fully defined. For
some such configurations there may be alternate ways to apply the
requirements of this specification to testing of the configuration, or
some variation in the test method may be necessary. It may therefore be
necessary for the parties to the testing to reach agreement over the
method of testing in advance.

If the BS is supplied in a number of different environmental enclosures
or configurations, it may not be necessary to test RF parameters for
each environmental configuration, provided that it can be demonstrated
that the equipment has been tested at the worst internal environmental
conditions.

Where alternative interpretations of this specification are possible for
a BS configuration under test, the interpretation which has been adopted
in performing the test shall be recorded with the test results.

Where variation in the test method within this TS has been necessary to
enable a BS configuration to be tested, the variation in the test method
which has been made in performing the test shall be recorded with the
test results. Where possible, agreement should be reached in advance
about the nature of such a variation with any party who will later
receive the test results.

Possible interpretations of this TS for some common configurations are
given in the following subclauses.

### 5.14.1 Receiver diversity

For the tests in clause 7 of the present document, the requirement
applies at each receiver antenna connector for receivers with antenna
diversity.

Receiver requirements are tested at the antenna connector, with the
remaining receiver(s) disabled or their antenna connector(s) being
terminated. If the manufacturer has declared the receiver paths to be
equivalent, it is sufficient to apply the specified test signal at any
one of the receiver antenna connectors.

For a multi-band BS, multi-band tests for blocking and intermodulation
are performed with the interferer(s) applied to each antenna connector
mapped to the receiver for the wanted signal(s), however only to one
antenna at a time. Antenna connectors to which no signals are applied
are terminated.

### 5.14.2 Duplexers

Due to TDD operation, there is no need to use a duplexer in the BS.

### 5.14.3 Power supply options

If the BS is supplied with a number of different power supply
configurations, it may not be necessary to test RF parameters for each
of the power supply options, provided that it can be demonstrated that
the range of conditions over which the equipment is tested is at least
as great as the range of conditions due to any of the power supply
configurations.

This applies particularly if a BS contains a DC rail which can be
supplied either externally or from an internal mains power supply. In
this case, the conditions of extreme power supply for the mains power
supply options can be tested by testing only the external DC supply
option. The range of DC input voltages for the test should be sufficient
to verify the performance with any of the power supplies, over its range
of operating conditions within the BS, including variation of mains
input voltage, temperature and output current.

### 5.14.4 Ancillary RF amplifiers

The requirements of this TS shall be met with the ancillary RF amplifier
fitted. At tests according to clause 6 and 7 for TX and RX respectively,
the ancillary amplifier is connected to the BS by a connecting network
(including any cable(s), attenuator(s), etc.) with applicable loss to
make sure the appropriate operating conditions of the ancillary
amplifier and the BS. The applicable connecting network loss range is
declared by the manufacturer. Other characteristics and the temperature
dependence of the attenuation of the connecting network are neglected.
The actual attenuation value of the connecting network is chosen for
each test as one of the applicable extreme values. The lowest value is
used unless otherwise stated.

Sufficient tests should be repeated with the ancillary amplifier fitted
and, if it is optional, without the ancillary RF amplifier to verify
that the BS meets the requirements of this TS in both cases.

### 5.14.5 BS using antenna arrays

A BS may be configured with a multiple antenna port connection for some
or all of its TRXs or with an antenna array related to one cell (not one
array per TRX). This subclause applies to a BS which meets at least one
of the following conditions:

\- The transmitter output signals from one or more TRX appear at more
than one antenna port, or

\- there is more than one receiver antenna port for a TRX or per cell
and an input signal is required at more than one port for the correct
operation of the receiver (NOTE: diversity reception does not meet this
requirement) thus the outputs from the transmitters as well as the
inputs to the receivers are directly connected to several antennas
(known as \"aircombining\"), or

If a BS is used, in normal operation, in conjunction with an antenna
system which contains filters or active elements which are necessary to
meet the UTRA requirements, the tests of conformance may be performed on
a system comprising the BS together with these elements, supplied
separately for the purposes of testing. In this case, it must be
demonstrated that the performance of the configuration under test is
representative of the system in normal operation, and the conformance
assessment is only applicable when the BS is used with the antenna
system.

For testing of conformance of such a BS, the following procedure may be
used:

#### 5.14.5.1 Receiver tests

For each test, the test signals applied to the receiver antenna
connectors shall be such that the sum of the powers of the signals
applied equals the power of the test signal(s) specified in the test.

An example of a suitable test set up is shown in figure 5.1.

![](media/image4.wmf){width="5.6875in" height="1.65625in"}

Figure 5.1: Receiver test set up

For spurious emissions from the receiver antenna connector, the test may
be performed separately for each receiver antenna connector.

#### 5.14.5.2 Transmitter tests

For each test, the conformance requirement shall be met by the sum of
the signals emitted by each transmitter antenna connector. This may be
assessed by separately measuring the signals emitted by each antenna
connector and summing the results, or by combining the signals and
performing a single measurement. The characteristics (e.g. amplitude and
phase) of the combining network should be such that the power of the
combined signal is maximised.

An example of a suitable test set up is shown in figure 5.2.

![](media/image5.wmf){width="3.34375in" height="1.65625in"}

Figure 5.2: Transmitter test set up

For Intermodulation attenuation, the test may be performed separately
for each transmitter antenna connector.

### 5.14.6 MIMO transmission

Unless otherwise stated, for the tests in clause 6 of the present
document, the requirement applies for each transmitter antenna connector
in the case of MIMO transmission.

Transmitter requirements are tested at the antenna connector, with the
remaining antenna connector(s) being terminated. If the manufacturer has
declared the transmitter paths to be equivalent, it is sufficient to
measure the signal at any one of the transmitter antenna connectors.

5.15 Overview of the conformance test requirements
--------------------------------------------------

Tables 5.9, 5.10 and 5.11 give an overview of the conformance test
requirements for the transmitter, the receiver and system performance,
respectively. Requirements related to receive functionality for the BS
under test do not apply for the case of MBSFN-only operation.

5.20 Test configurations for multi-carrier operation
----------------------------------------------------

The test configurations shall be constructed using the methods defined
below, subject to the parameters declared by the manufacturer for the
supported RF configurations as listed in subclause 5.1.2. The applicable
test configurations to be use for conformance testing are defined for
each supported RF configuration in clause 5.21.

Note: The test configurations in this subclause are intended for UTRA
TDD 1.28Mcps option.

### 5.20.1 UTTC1: Multi-carrier operation test configuration

The purpose of the UTTC1 is to test both BS transmitter and receiver
requirements.

#### 5.20.1.1 UTTC1 generation

UTTC1 should be constructed using the following method:

\- The RF bandwidth shall be the declared maximum supported RF
bandwidth.

\- Place two UTRA TDD 1.28Mcps option carriers adjacent to the high and
low edge of the RF bandwidth.

\- For transmitter tests, alternately place a UTRA TDD 1.28Mcps option
carrier adjacent to the already placed carriers at the low and high edge
of the RF bandwidth until there is no more space to fit a carrier or the
BS does not support more carriers. The nominal carrier spacing defined
in clause 4.4.1 shall apply.

#### 5.20.1.1 UTTC1 power allocation

Set the power of each carrier to the same level so that the sum of the
carrier powers equals the rated total output power according to the
manufacturer's declaration in sub clause 5.1.2.

### 5.20.2 UTTC2: Multi-band test configuration for full carrier allocation

The purpose of the UTTC2 is to test multi-band operation aspects
considering maximum supported number of carriers.

#### 5.20.2.1 UTTC2 generation

UTTC2 is based on re-using the exsiting test configuration applicable
per band involved in multi-band operation. It is constructed using the
following method:

● The RF bandwidth of each supported operating band in multi-band
operation shall be the declared maximum RF bandwidth of each supported
operating band in multi-band operation.

● The number of carriers of each supported operating band shall be the
declared maximum number of supported carrier of each supported operating
band in multi-band operation. Carriers shall first be placed at the
outermost edges of the declared maximum radio bandwidth. Additional
carriers shall next be placed at the edges of the RF bandwidths, if
possible.

● The allocated RF bandwidth of the outermost bands shall be located at
the outermost edges of the declared maximum radio bandwidth.

● Each concerned band shall be considered as an independent band and the
corresponding UTTC1shall be generated in each band. The mirror image of
the single-band test configuration shall be used in the highest band
being tested for the BS to ensure a narrowband carrier being placed at
both edges of the BS maximum radio bandwidth.

● If a multi-band BS supports only 3 carriers, two carriers shall be
placed in one band according to UTTC1while the remaining carrier shall
be placed at the edge of the maximum radio bandwidth in the other band.

● If the sum of the maximum RF bandwidth of each supported operating
bands is larger than the declared total RF bandwidth of transmitter and
receiver for the declared band combinations of the BS, repeat the steps
above for test configurations where the RF bandwidth of one of the
operating band shall be reduced so that the total RF bandwidth of
transmitter and receiver is not exceeded and vice versa.

● If the sum of the maximum number of supported carrier of each
supported operating bands in multi-band operation is larger than the
declared total number of supported carriers for the declared band
combinations of the BS, repeat the steps above for test configurations
where in each test configuration the number of carriers of one of the
operating band shall be reduced so that the total number of supported
carriers is not be exceeded and vice versa.

#### 5.20.2.2 UTTC2 power allocation

Unless otherwise stated, set the power of each carrier in all supported
operating bands to the same power so that the sum of the carrier powers
equals the total output power according to the manufacturer's
declaration.

If the allocated power of a supported operating band(s) exceeds the
declared rated total output power of the operating band(s) in multi-band
operation, the exceeded part shall, if possible, be reallocated into the
other band(s). If the power allocated for a carrier exceeds the rated
output power declared for that carrier, the exceeded power shall, if
possible, be reallocated into the other carriers.

5.21 Applicability of test configurations
-----------------------------------------

The present clause defines for each RF test requirement the set of
mandatory test configurations which shall be used for demonstrating
conformance. The applicable test configurations are specified in the
tables below for each supported RF configuration, which shall be
declared according to subclause 5.1.2. The generation and power
allocation for each test configuration is defined in clause 5.20.

For a BS declared to be capable of single carrier operation only, a
single carrier (SC) shall be used for testing.

For a BS declared to be capable of multi-carrier operation in contiguous
spectrum operation only, the test configurations in Table 5.14 shall be
used for testing.

Note: The applicability of test configurations in this subclause is only
applicable to UTRA TDD 1.28Mcps option.

operating in contiguous spectrum only

5.22 Requirements for BS capable of multi-band operation
--------------------------------------------------------

For BS capable of multi-band operation, the RF requirements in clause 6
and 7 apply for each supported operating band unless otherwise stated.
For some requirements it is explicitly stated that specific additions or
exclusions to the requirement apply for BS capable of multi-band
operation. In the case where multiple bands are mapped on separate
antenna connectors, the following applies:

\- Single-band transmitter spurious emissions, operating band unwanted
emissions, ACLR, transmitter intermodulation and receiver spurious
emissions requirements apply to each antenna connector.

\- If the BS is configured for single-band operation, single-band
requirements shall apply to the antenna connector configured for
single-band operation and no exclusions or provisions for multi-band
capable BS are applicable. Single-band requirements are tested
separately at the antenna connector configured for single-band
operation, with all other antenna connectors terminated.

For a BS capable of multi-band operation, the RF requirements in the
present specification assume synchronized operation, **where no
simultaneous uplink and downlink occur** between the supported operating
bands.

6 Transmitter characteristics
=============================

6.1 General
-----------

Unless otherwise stated, the requirements in clause 6 are expressed for
a single transmitter antenna connector. In case of multi-carrier
transmission with multiple transmitter antenna connectors or MIMO
transmission, the requirements apply for each transmitter antenna
connector.

A BS supporting MC-HSDPA transmits multiple carriers simultaneously on
adjacent carrier frequencies.

Unless otherwise stated, all measurements shall be made at the BS
antenna connector (test port A) with a full complement of transceivers
for the configuration in normal operating conditions. If any external
apparatus such as a TX amplifier, a filter or the combination of such
devices is used, the tests according to subclauses 5.14.4 shall be
performed to ensure that the requirements are met at test port B.

The set-up of physical channels for IMB transmitter tests shall be
according with the test models below.

6.4 Output power dynamics
-------------------------

### 6.4.1 Inner loop power control 

Inner loop power control is the ability of the BS transmitter to adjust
its code domain power in response to the UL received signal.

For inner loop correction on the Downlink Channel, the base station
adjusts the code domain power of a power controlled CCTrCH in response
to each valid power control bit received from the UE on the Uplink
Traffic Channel based on the mapping of the TPC bits in uplink CCTrCH to
downlink CCTrCH. Inner loop control is based on SIR measurements at the
UE receiver, and the corresponding TPC commands are generated by the UE.

### 6.4.2 Power control steps

#### 6.4.2.1 Definition and applicability

The power control step is the step change in the DL code domain power in
response to a TPC message from the UE.

#### 6.4.2.2 Minimum Requirements

The power control step sizes in the DL shall be 1 dB, 2 dB and 3 dB.

The tolerance of the code domain power and the greatest average rate of
change in code domain power due to the power control step shall be
within the range shown in Table 6.3.

  ----------- ----------- ------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------

The normative reference for this requirement is TS 25.105 \[1\]
subclause 6.4.2.1.

#### 6.4.2.3 Test purpose

The DL power control is applied to adjust the BS code domain power to a
value that is sufficiently high to generate a SIR at the UE receiver
equal to the target SIR, while limiting the intercell interference.

The test purpose is to verify the ability of the BS to interpret
received TPC commands in a correct way and to adjust its code domain
power according to these commands with the specified accuracy.

#### 6.4.4.5 Test Requirements

NOTE: If the Test Requirement below differs from the Minimum
Requirement, then the Test Tolerance applied for this test is non-zero.
The Test Tolerance for this test is defined in subclause 5.11 and the
explanation of how the Minimum Requirement has been relaxed by the Test
Tolerance is given in Annex D.

For all measurements, the minimum output power derived in step (4) of
subclause 6.4.4.4.2 shall be at least 29,3 dB below the maximum output
power; see 6.2.

### 6.4.5 Primary CCPCH power

#### 6.4.5.1 Definition and applicability

Primary CCPCH power is the code domain power of the Primary Common
Control Physical Channel averaged over the transmit timeslot. Primary
CCPCH power is signalled on the BCH.

#### 6.4.5.2 Minimum Requirements

The error between the BCH-broadcast value of the Primary CCPCH power and
the Primary CCPCH code domain power averaged over the timeslot shall not
exceed the values in table 6.8. The error is a function of the output
power averaged over the timeslot, Pout, and the manufacturer\'s rated
output power, PRAT.

Table 6.8: Errors between Primary CCPCH power and the broadcast value

  ------------------------------ ------------------------
  Output power in slot, dB       PCCPCH power tolerance
  PRAT - 3 \< Pout ≤ PRAT + 2    +/- 2,5 dB
  PRAT - 6 \< Pout ≤ PRAT - 3    +/- 3,5 dB
  PRAT - 13 \< Pout ≤ PRAT - 6   +/- 5 dB
  ------------------------------ ------------------------

The normative reference for this requirement is TS 25.105 \[1\]
subclause 6.4.5.

#### 6.4.5.3 Test purpose

The code domain power of the Primary CCPCH received by the UE, together
with the information on the Primary CCPCH nominal output power signaled
on the BCH, are used by the UE for path loss estimation and adjustment
of its own transmit power. Therefore, deviations of the Primary CCPCH
code domain power from its nominal value are transposed by the UE into
deviations from the wanted output power of the UE.

The test purpose is to verify that the Primary CCPCH code domain power

#### 6.4.5.5 Test Requirements

NOTE: If the Test Requirement below differs from the Minimum
Requirement, then the Test Tolerance applied for this test is non-zero.
The Test Tolerance for this test is defined in subclause 5.11 and the
explanation of how the Minimum Requirement has been relaxed by the Test
Tolerance is given in Annex D.

The Primary CCPCH power, measured according to subclause 6.4.5.4.2,
shall be within the limits defined in table 6.10

Table 6.10: Test Requirements for errors between Primary CCPCH power and
the broadcast value

  ------------------------------ ------------------------
  Output power in slot, dB       PCCPCH power tolerance
  PRAT - 3 \< Pout ≤ PRAT + 2    +/- 3,3 dB
  PRAT - 6 \< Pout ≤ PRAT - 3    +/- 4,3 dB
  PRAT - 13 \< Pout ≤ PRAT - 6   +/- 5,8 dB
  ------------------------------ ------------------------

### 6.4.6 Differential accuracy of Primary CCPCH power

#### 6.4.6.1 Definition and applicability

The differential accuracy of the Primary CCPCH power is the relative
transmitted power accuracy of PCCPCH in consecutive frames when the
nominal PCCPCH power is not changed.

#### 6.4.6.2 Minimum Requirements

The differential accuracy of PCCPCH power shall be within ± 0,5 dB.

The normative reference for this requirement is TS 25.105 \[1\]
subclause 6.4.6.

#### 6.4.6.3 Test purpose

The power of the Primary CCPCH received by the UE, together with the
information on the Primary CCPCH nominal transmit power signaled on the
BCH, are used by the UE for path loss estimation and adjustment of its
own transmit power. Therefore, a lack of accuracy of the Primary CCPCH
power over time will result in unwanted fluctuations of the transmit
power of the UE which may degrade system performance.

The test purpose is to verify that the differential accuracy of the
Primary CCPCH power remains within its specified tolerances.

6.6 Output RF spectrum emissions
--------------------------------

### 6.6.1 Occupied bandwidth

#### 6.6.1.1 Definition and applicability

Occupied bandwidth is a measure of the bandwidth containing 99% of the
total integrated power for transmitted spectrum and is centered on the
assigned channel frequency.

#### 6.6.1.2 Minimum Requirements

##### 6.6.1.2.1 3,84 Mcps TDD option

The occupied bandwidth shall be less than 5 MHz based on a chip rate of
3,84 Mcps.

The normative reference for this requirement is TS 25.105 \[1\]
subclause 6.6.1.1.

##### 6.6.1.2.2 1,28 Mcps TDD option

The occupied bandwidth shall be less than 1,6 MHz based on a chip rate
of 1,28 Mcps.

The reference for this requirement is TS 25.105 \[1\] subclause 6.6.1.2.

##### 6.6.1.2.3 7,68 Mcps TDD option

The occupied bandwidth shall be less than 10 MHz based on a chip rate of
7,68 Mcps.

The reference for this requirement is TS 25.105 \[1\] subclause 6.6.1.3.

#### 6.6.1.3 Test purpose

The occupied bandwidth, defined in the Radio Regulations of the
International Telecommunication Union ITU, is a useful concept for
specifying the spectral properties of a given emission in the simplest
possible manner; see also Recommendation ITU-R SM.328 \[7\]. The test
purpose is to verify that the emission of the BS does not occupy an
excessive bandwidth for the service to be provided and is, therefore,
not likely to create interference to other users of the spectrum beyond
undue limits.

Requirements, then the Test Tolerance applied for this test is non-zero.
The Test Tolerance for this test is defined in subclause 5.11 and the
explanation of how the Minimum Requirement has been relaxed by the Test
Tolerance is given in Annex D.

##### 6.6.1.5.1 3,84 Mcps TDD option

### 6.6.2 Out of band emission

Out of band emissions are unwanted emissions immediately outside the
channel bandwidth resulting from the modulation process and
non-linearity in the transmitter but excluding spurious emissions. This
out of band emission requirement is specified both in terms of a
spectrum emission mask and adjacent channel power ratio for the
transmitter.

#### 6.6.2.1 Spectrum emission mask

##### 6.6.2.1.1 Definition and applicability

###### 6.6.2.1.1.1 3,84 Mcps TDD option

The spectrum emission mask specifies the limit of the transmitter out of
band emissions at frequency offsets from the assigned channel frequency
of the wanted signal between 2,5 MHz and 12,5 MHz.

The mask defined in subclause 6.6.2.1.2.1 below may be mandatory in
certain regions. In other regions this mask may not be applied.

For regions in which the mask is mandatory, the requirements shall apply
to both Wide Area BS and Local Area BS.

The spectrum emission mask specifies the limit of the transmitter out of
band emissions at frequency offsets from the assigned channel frequency
of the wanted signal between 0,8 MHz and 4 MHz.

For BS capable of multi-band operation where multiple bands are mapped
on separate antenna connectors, the single-band requirements apply and
the cumulative evaluation of the emission limit in the inter RF

The normative reference for this requirement is TS 25.105 \[1\]
subclause 6.6.2.1.1

###### 6.6.2.1.2.2 1,28 Mcps TDD option

For regions where this subclause applies, the requirement shall be met
by a base station transmitting on a single RF carrier configured in
accordance with the manufacturer's specification. Emissions shall not
exceed the maximum level specified in tables 6.13A to 16A in the
frequency range of f\_offset from 0.815 MHz to f\_offset~max~ from the
carrier frequency, where:

\- ∆f is the separation between the carrier frequency and the nominal
-3dB point of the measuring filter closest to the carrier frequency.

\- f\_offset is the separation between the carrier frequency and the
centre of the measurement filter

\- f\_offset~max~ is either 4 MHz or the offset to the operating band
edge, whichever is the greater.

\- ∆f ~max~ is equal to f\_offset~max~ minus half of the bandwidth of
the mesurement filter.

For BS operating in multiple bands, inside any inter RF bandwidth gaps
with W~gap~ \< 8 MHz, emissions shall not exceed the cumulative sum of
the minimum requirements specified at the RF bandwidth edges on each
side of the inter RF bandwidth gap. The minimum requirement for RF
bandwidth edge is specified in Tables 6.13A to 6.16A below, where in
this case.

\- ∆f equal to 0.8MHz plus the separation between the RF bandwidth edge
frequency and the nominal -3dB point of the measuring filter closest to
the RF bandwidth edge.

\- f\_offset is equal to 0.8MHz plus the separation between the RF
bandwith edge frequency and the center frequency of the measuring
filter.

\- f\_offsetmax is either 4 MHz or the offset to the supported operating
band edge as defined, whichever is the greater.

\- ∆f max is equal to f\_offsetmax minus half of the bandwidth of the
mesurement filter.

For a multi-carrier BS, the definitions above apply to the lower edge of
the carrier transmitted at the lowest carrier frequency and the upper
edge of the carrier transmitted at the highest carrier frequency within
a specified frequency band.

The normative reference for this requirement is TS 25.105 \[1\]
subclause 6.6.2.1.3.

##### 6.6.2.1.3 Test purpose

The test purpose is to verify that the BS out of band emissions do not
result in undue interference to any other system (wideband, narrowband)
operating at frequencies close to the assigned channel bandwidth of the
wanted signal.

This test is independent of the characteristics of possible victim
systems and, therefore, complements the tests on occupied bandwidth in
6.6.1 (verifying the spectral concentration of the BS Tx emissions) and
on ACLR in 6.6.2.2 (simulating the perception of other UTRA receivers).

###### 6.6.2.1.4.2 Procedure

####### 6.6.2.1.4.2.1 3,84 Mcps TDD option

Measure the power of the BS spectrum emissions by applying measurement
filters with bandwidths as specified in the relevant table in subclause
6.6.2.1.2.1. The characteristic of the filters shall be approximately
Gaussian (typical spectrum analyzer filters). The centre frequency of
the filter shall be stepped in contiguous steps over the ranges of
frequency offsets f\_offset as given in the tables. The step width shall
be equal to the respective measurement bandwidth. The time duration of
each step shall be sufficiently long to capture one active time slot.

For frequency offsets of the measurement filter centre frequency in the
range 4,0 MHz ≤ f\_offset \< f\_offset~max~, the measurement shall be
performed by applying filters with measurement bandwidth of 50 kHz or
less and integrating the measured results over the nominal measurement
bandwidth 1 MHz specified in the tables in subclause 6.6.2.1.2.1.

####### 6.6.2.1.4.2.2 1,28 Mcps TDD option

1\) Measure the power of the BS spectrum emissions by applying
measurement filters with bandwidths as specified in the relevant table
in subclause 6.6.2.1.2.2. The characteristic of the filters shall be
approximately Gaussian (typical spectrum analyzer filters). The centre
frequency of the filter shall be stepped in contiguous steps over the
ranges of frequency offsets f\_offset as given in the tables. The step
width shall be equal to the respective measurement bandwidth. The time
duration of each step shall be sufficiently long to capture one active
time slot.

2\) The measurement shall be performed by applying filters with
measurement bandwidth of 50 kHz or less and integrating the measured
results over the nominal measurement bandwidth 1 MHz specified in the
tables in subclause 6.6.2.1.2.2 when the measurement bandwidth is 1MHz.

In addition, for a multi-band capable BS, the following steps shall
apply:

3\) For multi-band capable BS and single band tests, repeat the steps
above per involved band with no carrier activated in the other band.

4\) For multi-band capable BS with separate antenna connector, the
antenna connector not being under test in case of single-band or
multi-band test shall be terminated.

The same procedure specified in 6.6.2.1.4.2.1 applies to 3,84 Mcps TDD
option BS supporting 16QAM.

####### 6.6.2.1.4.2.5 7,68 Mcps TDD option

Measure the power of the BS spectrum emissions by applying measurement
filters with bandwidths as specified in the relevant table in subclause
6.6.2.1.2.3. The characteristic of the filters shall be approximately
Gaussian (typical spectrum analyzer filters). The centre frequency of
the filter shall be stepped in contiguous steps over the ranges of
frequency offsets f\_offset as given in the tables. The step width shall
be equal to the respective measurement bandwidth. The time duration of
each step shall be sufficiently long to capture one active time slot.

For frequency offsets of the measurement filter centre frequency in the
range 6,5 MHz ≤ f\_offset \< f\_offset~max~, the measurement shall be
performed by applying filters with measurement bandwidth of 50 kHz or
less and integrating the measured results over the nominal measurement
bandwidth 1 MHz specified in the tables in subclause 6.6.2.1.2.3.

Spurious emissions are emissions which are caused by unwanted
transmitter effects such as harmonics emission, parasitic emission,
intermodulation products and frequency conversion products, but exclude
out of band emissions. This is measured at the base station antenna
connector.

The requirements shall apply whatever the type of transmitter considered
(single carrier or multiple carrier). It applies for all transmission
modes foreseen by the manufacturer's specification.

For 3,84 Mcps TDD option, either requirement (except 6.6.3.2.6) applies
at frequencies within the specified frequency ranges which are more than
12,5 MHz under the first carrier frequency used or more than 12,5 MHz
above the last carrier frequency used.

For 1,28 Mcps TDD option, the mandatory spurious emission requirement
applies from 9kHz to 12.75GHz, excluding the frequency ranges from 4 MHz
below the lowest frequency of each supported operating band to4 MHz
above the highest frequency of each operating band. For BS capable of
multi-band operation where multiple bands are mapped on the same antenna
connector, this exclusion applies for each supported operating bands.
For BS capable of multi-band operation where multiple bands are mapped
on separate antenna connectors, the sinlge-band requirements apply and
the multi-band exclusions and provisions are not applicable.

For 7.68 Mcps TDD option, either requirement (except 6.6.3.2.6) applies
at frequencies within the specified frequency ranges which are more than
25 MHz under the first carrier frequency used or more than 25 MHz above
the last carrier frequency used.

Unless otherwise stated, all requirements are measured as mean power.

The normative reference for this requirement is TS 25.105 \[1\]
subclause 6.6.3.2.1.1.

###### 6.6.3.2.2.2 Co-located base stations

These requirements may be applied for the protection of other BS
receivers when GSM, DCS, E-UTRA and/or UTRA BS are co-located with a
UTRA TDD BS.

The power of any spurious emission shall not exceed the maximum level
given in table 6.32.

For BS capable of multi-band operation, the exclusions and conditions in
the Note column of Table 6.32 apply for each supported operating band.
For BS capable of multi-band operation where multiple bands are mapped
on separate antenna connectors, the exclusions and conditions in the
Note column of Table 6.32 apply for the operating band supported at that
antenna connector.

NOTE: The requirements in Table 6.36A for the Wide Area BS are based on
a minimum coupling loss of 67 dB between unsynchronised TDD base
stations. The requirements in Table 6.36A for the Local Area BS are
based on a coupling loss of 70 dB between unsynchronised Wide Area and
Local Area TDD base stations. The scenarios leading to these
requirements are addressed in TR 25.942 \[9\].

The normative reference for this requirement is TS 25.105 \[1\]
subclause 6.6.3.5.1.1.1.

####### 6.6.3.2.5.1.2 1,28 Mcps TDD option

In geographic areas where 1,28 Mcps TDD is deployed, the RRC filtered
mean power of any spurious emission shall not exceed the maximum level
given in table 6.36B.

For BS capable of multi-band operation, the exclusions and conditions in
the Note of Table 6.36B apply for each supported operating band. For BS
capable of multi-band operation where multiple bands are mapped on
separate antenna connectors, the exclusions and conditions in the Note
of Table 6.36B apply for the operating band supported at that antenna
connector.

subclause 6.6.3.5.2.1.1.

####### 6.6.3.2.5.2.2 1,28 Mcps TDD option

In geographic areas where 1,28 Mcps TDD is deployed, the RRC filtered
mean power of any spurious emission in case of co-location shall not
exceed the maximum level given in table 6.36E.

For BS capable of multi-band operation, the exclusions and conditions in
the Note of Table 6.36E apply for each supported operating band. For BS
capable of multi-band operation where multiple bands are mapped on
separate antenna connectors, the exclusions and conditions in the Note
of Table 6.36E apply for the operating band supported at that antenna
connector.

##### 6.6.3.4.2 Procedure

1\) Measure the power of the spurious emissions by applying measurement
filters with bandwidths as specified in the relevant tables of subclause
6.6.3.2. The characteristics of the measurement filter with the
bandwidth 1,28 MHz or 3,84MHz shall be RRC with roll-off α = 0,22. The
characteristics of the measurement filters with bandwidths 100 kHz and 1
MHz shall be approximately Gaussian (typical spectrum analyzer filter).
The center frequency of the filter shall be stepped in contiguous steps
over the frequency bands as given in the tables. The step width shall be
equal to the respective measurement bandwidth. The time duration of each
step shall be sufficiently long to capture one active time slot.

In addition, for a multi-band capable BS, the following steps shall
apply:

2\) For multi-band capable BS and single band tests, repeat the steps
above per involved band with no carrier activated in the other band.

3\) For multi-band capable BS with separate antenna connector, the
antenna connector not being under test in case of single-band or
multi-band test shall be terminated.

#### 6.6.3.5 Test Requirements

NOTE: If the Test Requirement below differs from the Minimum
Requirement, then the Test Tolerance applied for this test is non-zero.
The Test Tolerance for this test is defined in subclause 5.11 and the
explanation of how the Minimum Requirement has been relaxed by the Test
Tolerance is given in Annex D.

The spurious emissions measured according to subclause 6.6.3.4.2 shall
not exceed the limits specified in the relevant tables of 6.6.3.2.

For 3,84 Mcps TDD BS supporting 16QAM, the measured spurious emissions
shall not exceed the limits specified for 3,84 Mcps TDD option in
section 6.6.3.2.

For 1,28 Mcps TDD BS supporting 16QAM, the measured spurious emissions
shall not exceed the limits specified for 1,28 Mcps TDD option in
section 6.6.3.2.

For 7,68 Mcps TDD BS supporting 16QAM, the measured spurious emissions
shall not exceed the limits specified for 7,68 Mcps TDD option in
section 6.6.3.2.

6.7 Transmit intermodulation
----------------------------

### 6.7.1 Definition and applicability

The transmit intermodulation performance is a measure of the capability
of the transmitter to inhibit the generation of signals in its non
linear elements caused by presence of the wanted signal and an
interfering signal reaching the transmitter via the antenna.

The transmit intermodulation level is the power of the intermodulation
products when a CDMA modulated interference signal is injected into the
antenna connector at a power level of 30 dB lower than that of the rated
total output power in the operating band.

#### 6.7.1.1 3,84 Mcps TDD option

The carrier frequency of the interference signal shall be ±5 MHz, ±10
MHz and ±15 MHz offset from the subject signal carrier frequency, but
excluding interference carrier frequencies outside of the UTRA frequency
bands specified in 4.2a, 4.2b or 4.2c, respectively.

#### 6.7.1.2 1,28 Mcps TDD option

The interfering signal offset from the subject signal shall be as
defined in table 6.37F.

For BS capable of multi-band operation where multiple bands are mapped
on separate antenna connectors, the single-band requirements apply
regardless of the interfering signals position relative to the inter RF
bandwidth gap.

Table 6.37F: Interfering signal frequency offset

+----------------------------------------------------------+----------+
| Parameter                                                | Value    |
+----------------------------------------------------------+----------+
| Interfering signal frequency offset from the subject     | ±1,6 MHz |
| signal carrier frequency                                 |          |
|                                                          | ±3,2 MHz |
|                                                          |          |
|                                                          | ±4,8 MHz |
+----------------------------------------------------------+----------+
| Interfering signal frequency offset from the edge of RF  | ±0.8MHz  |
| bandwidth                                                |          |
|                                                          | ±2.4 MHz |
|                                                          |          |
|                                                          | ±4.0 MHz |
+----------------------------------------------------------+----------+
| NOTE 1: Interference frequencies that are outside of the |          |
| allocated frequency band are excluded from the           |          |
| requirement, unless the interfering signal positions     |          |
| fall within the frequency range of adjacent downlink     |          |
| operating bands in the same geographical area.           |          |
+----------------------------------------------------------+----------+

#### 6.7.1.3 7,68 Mcps TDD option

The carrier frequency of the interference signal shall be ±10 MHz, ±20
MHz and ±30 MHz offset from the subject signal carrier frequency, but
excluding interference carrier frequencies outside of the UTRA frequency
bands specified in 4.2a, 4.2b or 4.2c, respectively.

### 6.7.2 Minimum Requirements

The transmit intermodulation level shall not exceed the out of band or
the spurious emission requirements of subclause 6.6.2 and 6.6.3,
respectively.

The normative reference for this requirement is TS 25.105 \[1\]
subclause 6.7.1.

### 6.7.3 Test purpose

The test purpose is to verify the ability of the BS transmitter to
restrict the generation of intermodulation products in its non linear
elements caused by presence of the wanted signal and an interfering
signal reaching the transmitter via the antenna to below specified
levels.

#### 6.7.4.2 Procedure

1\) Apply the single-band test procedures for out of band and spurious
emissions as described in 6.6.2 and 6.6.3, respectively, at the
frequencies of all third and fifth order intermodulation products. The
frequency band occupied by the interference signal are excluded from the
measurements.

In addition, for a multi-band capable BS, the following steps shall
apply:

2\) For multi-band capable BS and single band tests, repeat the steps
above per involved band with no carrier activated in the other band.

3\) For multi-band capable BS with separate antenna connector, the
antenna connector not being under test shall be terminated.

NOTE: The third order intermodulation products are at frequencies (F1 ±
2F2) and (2F1 ± F2), the fifth order intermodulation products are at
frequencies (2F1 ± 3F2), (3F1 ± 2F2), (4F1 ± F2) and (F1 ± 4F2), where
F1 represents the frequencies within the bandwidth of the wanted signal
and F2 represents the frequencies within the bandwidth of the CDMA
modulated interference signal.

### 6.7.5 Test Requirements

NOTE: If the Test Requirement below differs from the Minimum
Requirement, then the Test Tolerance applied for this test is non-zero.
The Test Tolerance for this test is defined in subclause 5.11 and the
explanation of how the Minimum Requirement has been relaxed by the Test
Tolerance is given in Annex D.

The power level of the CDMA modulated interference signal shall be 30 dB
below the rated total output power in the operating band.

At the frequencies of all third and fifth order intermodulation
products, the Test Requirements for out of band and spurious emissions
as specified in subclauses 6.6.2.1.5 (Spectrum emission mask), 6.6.2.2.5
(ACLR) and 6.6.3.5 (Spurious emissions) shall be met.

The requirement is always applicable outside the Base Station RF
bandwidth or maximum radio bandwidth.

For a BS capable of multi-band operation, the requirement applies
relative to the RF bandwidth edges in each supported operating band. In
case the inter RF bandwidth gap is less than 4.8 MHz, the requirement in
the gap applies only for interfering signal offsets where the
interfering signal falls completely within the inter RF bandwidth gap.

6.8 Transmit Modulation
-----------------------

### 6.8.1 Modulation accuracy

#### 6.8.1.1 Definition and applicability

The Error Vector Magnitude is a measure of the difference between the
reference waveform and the measured waveform. This difference is called
the error vector. Both waveforms pass through a matched Root Raised
Cosine filter with bandwidth corresponding to the considered chip rate
and roll-off α =0,22. Both waveforms are then further modified by
selecting the frequency, absolute phase, absolute amplitude and chip
clock timing so as to minimise the error vector. The EVM result is
defined as the square root of the ratio of the mean error vector power
to the mean reference power expressed as a %. The measurement interval
is one timeslot. [ ]{.underline} The requirement is valid over the total
power dynamic range as specified in section 3.1. See Annex C of this
specification for further details.

NOTE: The theoretical modulated waveform shall be calculated on the
basis that the transmit pulse shaping filter is a root-raised cosine
(RRC) with roll-off α =0,22 in the frequency domain. The impulse
response of the chip impulse filter *RC*~0~(*t*) is

![](media/image12.wmf){width="2.926388888888889in"
height="0.9222222222222223in"}

Where the roll-off factor α = 0,22 and *T~C~* is the chip duration

#### 6.8.1.2 Minimum Requirements

The error vector magnitude (EVM) shall not exceed 12,5 %. The
requirement is valid over the total power dynamic range as specified in
section 3.1.

The normative reference for this requirement is TS 25.105 \[1\]
subclause 6.8.2.1.

#### 6.8.1.3 Test purpose

The test purpose is to verify the ability of the BS transmitter to
generate a sufficient precise waveform and thus to enable the UE
receiver to achieve the specified error performance.

#### 6.8.1.4 Method of test

##### 6.8.1.4.1 Initial conditions

For 1,28 Mcps BS supporting 16QAM, the EVM requirements shall be tested
with the general test set up specified in section 6.8.1.4.1.2 and also
with the special test set up for 16QAM capable base station specified in
section 6.8.1.4.1.2.

#### 6.8.1.5 Test Requirements

NOTE: If the Test Requirement below differs from the Minimum
Requirement, then the Test Tolerance applied for this test is non-zero.
The Test Tolerance for this test is defined in subclause 5.11 and the
explanation of how the Minimum Requirement has been relaxed by the Test
Tolerance is given in Annex D.

The error vector magnitude (EVM) for each carrier measured according to
subclause 6.8.1.4.2 shall not exceed 12,5 %.

### 6.8.2 Peak code domain error

#### 6.8.2.1 Definition and applicability

The code domain error is computed by projecting the error vector power
onto the code domain at a specific spreading factor. The error power for
each code is defined as the ratio to the mean power of the reference
waveform expressed in dB. And the Peak Code Domain Error is defined as
the maximum value for Code Domain Error. The measurement interval is one
timeslot.

The requirements in this subclause shall apply to both Wide Area BS and
Local Area BS.

#### 6.8.2.2 Minimum Requirements

The peak code domain error shall not exceed -28 dB at spreading factor
16. For 7.68 Mcps, the peak code domain error shall not exceed -31 dB at
spreading factor 32.

The normative reference for this requirement is TS 25.105 \[1\]
subclause 6.8.3.1.

#### 6.8.2.3 Test purpose

The test purpose is to verify the ability of the BS transmitter to limit
crosstalk among codes and thus to enable the UE receiver to achieve the
specified error performance.

#### 6.8.2.4 Method of test

##### 6.8.2.4.1 Initial conditions

code is defined as the ratio of the mean power of the error projection
onto that code, to the mean power of the active code in the composite
reference waveform. This ratio is expressed in dB. The measurement
interval is one timeslot.

The requirement for Relative Code Domain Error is only applicable for
64QAM modulated codes.

#### 6.8.3.2 Minimum requirement

The average Relative Code Domain Error for 64QAM modulated codes shall

The requirements in clause 7 are expressed for a single receiver antenna
connector. For receivers with antenna diversity, the requirements apply
for each receiver antenna connector.

For ACS, blocking and intermodulation characteristics, the negative
offsets of the interfering signal apply relative to the assigned channel
frequency of the lowest carrier frequency used and positive offsets of
the interfering signal apply relative to the assigned channel frequency
of the highest carrier frequency used.

A BS supporting 1.28Mcps MC-HSUPA receives mutilple carriers
simultaneously on adjacent carrier frequencies.

All tests unless otherwise stated in this subclause shall be conducted
on Base Station Systems fitted with a full complement of Transceivers
for the configuration. The manufacturer shall provide appropriate
logical or physical test access to perform all tests in this subclause.
Measurements shall include any RX multicoupler.

In all the relevant subclauses in this clause all Bit Error Ratio (BER),
Residual BER (RBER) and Frame Erasure Ratio (FER) measurements shall be
carried out according to the general rules for statistical testing
defined in ITU-T Recommendation O.153 \[10\] and Annex F.

The BER requirements defined for the receiver characteristics in this
clause do not assume HARQ transmissions.

When the BS is configured to receive multiple carriers, all the BER
requirements are applicable for each received carrier.

Unless otherwise stated, all tests in this clause shall be performed at
the BS antenna connector (test port A).If any external apparatus such as
a RX amplifier, a filter or the combination of such devices is used, the
tests according to subclauses 5.14.4 shall be performed to ensure that
the requirements are met at test port B.

7.5 Blocking characteristics
----------------------------

### 7.5.1 Definition and applicability

#### 7.5.1.1 3,84 Mcps TDD option

The blocking characteristics is a measure of the receiver ability to
receive a wanted signal at its assigned channel frequency in the
presence of an unwanted interferer on frequencies other than those of
the adjacent channels. The blocking performance requirements apply to
interfering signals with center frequency within the ranges specified in
tables7.6-1, 7.7-1, 7.8-1, 7.9-1, 7.6-2, 7.7-2, 7.8-2, 7.9-2, 7.9 and
7.10 respectively, using a 1 MHz step size.

In this subclause, different requirements shall apply to Wide Area BS
and Local Area BS.The requirements in tables 7.6-1, 7.7-1, 7.8-1, 7.9-1
apply to Wide Area BS, and the requirements in tables 7.6-2, 7.7-2,
7.8-2 or 7.9-2 apply to Local Area BS, depending on which frequency band
is used. The additional requirements in Tables 7.9 and 7.10 may be
applied for the protection of TDD BS receivers when GSM900 and/or
DCS1800 BTS are co-located with UTRA TDD Wide Area BS.

#### 7.5.1.2 1,28 Mcps TDD option

The blocking characteristics is a measure of the receiver ability to
receive a wanted signal at its assigned channel frequency in the
presence of an unwanted interferer on frequencies other than those of
the adjacent channels. T The interfering signal are either a narrow band
CDMA signal with one code for in-band blocking or a CW signal for
out-of-band.

The requirements shall apply to BS class, depending on which frequency
band is used.

#### 7.5.1.3 7,68 Mcps TDD option

The blocking characteristics is a measure of the receiver ability to
receive a wanted signal at its assigned channel frequency in the
presence of an unwanted interferer on frequencies other than those of
the adjacent channels. The blocking performance requirements apply to
interfering signals with center frequency within the ranges specified in
tables 7.6-1B, 7.7-1B, 7.8-1B, 7.6-2B, 7.7-2B, 7.8-2B, 7.9B and 7.10F
respectively, using a 1 MHz step size.

In this subclause, different requirements shall apply to Wide Area BS
and Local Area BS.The requirements in tables 7.6-1B, 7.7-1B or 7.8-1B
apply to Wide Area BS, and the requirements in tables 7.6-2B, 7.7-2B or
7.8-2B apply to Local Area BS, depending on which frequency band is
used. The additional requirements in Tables 7.9B and 7.10F may be
applied for the protection of TDD BS receivers when GSM900 and/or
DCS1800 BTS are co-located with UTRA TDD Wide Area BS.

The normative reference for this requirement is TS 25.105 \[1\]
subclause 7.5.0.1.

##### 7.5.2.1.2 Co-location with GSM, DCS, UTRA-FDD and/or E-UTRA FDD

This additional blocking requirement may be applied for the protection
of TDD BS receivers when GSM, DCS, UTRA-FDD and/or E-UTRA-FDD BTS are
co-located with UTRA TDD Wide Area BS.

The blocking performance requirement applies to interfering signals with
center frequency within the ranges specified in the tables below, using
a 1MHz step size.

In case this additional blocking requirement is applied, the static
reference performance as specified in clause 7.2.1 shall be met with a
wanted and an interfering signal coupled to BS antenna input using the
following parameters.

Table 7.10A: Void

Table 7.10B: Void

#### 7.5.2.2 1,28 Mcps TDD option

##### 7.5.2.2.1 General requirements

The static reference performance as specified in clause 7.2 shall be met
with a wanted and an interfering signal coupled to the BS antenna input
using the parameters specified in tables 7.6A-1, 7.7A-1,7.8A-1, 7.9A-1,
7.6A-2, 7.7A-2, 7.8A-2 or 7.9A-2, respectively.

The blocking requirement is always applicable outside the Base Station
RF bandwidth or maximum radio bandwidth edges. The interfering signal
offset is defined relative to the lower (upper) or maximum radio
bandwidth edges.

For BS capable of multi-band operation, the requirement in the in-band
blocking frequency range applies for each supported operating band. The
requirements applies in addition inside any inter RF bandwidth gap as
long as the inter RF bandwidth gap size is at least 4.8MHz. The
interfering signal offset is defined relative to the lower/upper RF
bandwidth edges inside the inter RF bandwidth gap and is equal to
-2.4MHz/+2.4MHz, respectively.

For BS capable of multi-band operation, the requirement in the
out-of-band blocking frequency ranges apply for each supported operating
band, with the exception that the in-band blocking frequency ranges of
all supported operating bands shall be excluded from the out-of-band
blocking requirement.

The normative reference for this requirement is TS 25.105 \[1\]
subclause 7.5.0.2.

##### 7.5.2.2.2 Co-location with GSM, DCS, UTRA FDD and/or E-UTRA FDD, UTRA TDD and/or E-UTRA TDD

This additional blocking requirement may be applied for the protection
of TDD BS receivers when GSM, DCS, UTRA FDD, E-UTRA FDD, FDD
unsynchonized UTRA TDD and/or unsynchronized E-UTRA TDD BTS operating in
a different frequency band are co-located with UTRA TDD Wide Area BS.

The blocking performance requirement applies to interfering signals with
centre frequency within the ranges specified in the tables below, using
a 1MHz step size.

In case this additional blocking requirement is applied, the static
reference performance as specified in clause 7.2.1 shall be met with a
wanted and an interfering signal coupled to BS antenna input using the
following parameters.

##### 7.5.2.3.4 Co-location with GSM, DCS, UTRA-FDD and/or E-UTRA FDD

This additional blocking requirement may be applied for the protection
of TDD BS receivers when GSM, DCS, UTRA-FDD and/or E-UTRA-FDD BTS are
co-located with UTRA TDD Wide Area BS.

The blocking performance requirement applies to interfering signals with
center frequency within the ranges specified in the tables below, using
a 1MHz step size.

In case this additional blocking requirement is applied, the static
reference performance as specified in clause 7.2.1 shall be met with a
wanted and an interfering signal coupled to BS antenna input using the
following parameters.

### 7.5.3 Test purpose

#### 7.5.3.1 3,84 Mcps TDD option

The test stresses the ability of the BS receiver to withstand high-level
interference from unwanted signals at frequency offsets of 10 MHz or
more, without undue degradation of its sensitivity.

#### 7.5.3.2 1,28 Mcps TDD option

The test stresses the ability of the BS receiver to withstand high-level
interference from unwanted signals at frequency offsets of 3,2 MHz or
more, without undue degradation of its sensitivity.

#### 7.5.3.3 7,68 Mcps TDD option

The test stresses the ability of the BS receiver to withstand high-level
interference from unwanted signals at frequency offsets of 20 MHz or
more, without undue degradation of its sensitivity.

### 7.5.4 Method of test

#### 7.5.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: normal; see subclause 5.9.1.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier: M; see subclause 5.3. The
BS shall be configured to operate as close to the centre of the
operating band as possible.

RF bandwidth positions to be tested for multi-carrier: M~RFBW~ in single
band operaiton, see subclause 5.3; B~RFBW~\_T'~RFBW~ and
B'~RFBW~\_T~RFBW~ in multi-band operation, see subclause 5.3;

In addition, in multi-band operation:

\- For B~RFBW~\_T'~RFBW~, out-of-band blocking testing above the highest
operating band may be omitted.

\- For B'~RFBW~\_T~RFBW~, out-of-band blocking testing below the lowest
operating band may be omitted.

\(1\) Connect an UE simulator operating at the assigned channel
frequency of the wanted signal and a signal generator to the antenna
connector of one Rx port.

\(2\) Terminate or disable any other Rx port not under test.

\(3\) Start transmission from the BS tester to the BS using the UL
reference measurement channel (12,2 kbps) defined in Annex A.2.1. For a
BS supporting multi-carrier operation, generate the wanted signal
according to the applicable test configuration (see subclause 5.20 and
5.21) using the UL reference measurement channel in Annex A.2.1on all
carriers for the BS under test. The level of the UE simulator signal
measured at the BS antenna connector shall be set according to subclause
7.5.2.2.

#### 7.5.4.2 Procedure

##### 7.5.4.2.1 3,84 Mcps TDD option

\(1\) Set the signal generator to produce an interfering signal at a
frequency offset Fuw from the assigned channel frequency of the wanted
signal which is given by

Fuw = ± (n x 1 MHz),

> where n shall be increased in integer steps from n = 10 up to such a
> value that the center frequency of the interfering signal covers the
> range from 1 MHz to 12,75 GHz. The interfering signal level measured
> at the antenna connector shall be set in dependency of its center
> frequency, as specified in tables 7.6 to 7.10. The type of the
> interfering signal is either equivalent to a continuous wideband CDMA
> signal with one code of chip frequency 3,84 Mchip/s, filtered by an
> RRC transmit pulse-shaping filter with roll-off α = 0,22, or a CW
> signal; see tables 7.6 to 7.10.

\(2\) Measure the BER of the wanted signal at the BS receiver.

\(3\) Interchange the connections of the BS Rx ports and repeat the
measurements according to steps (1) and (2).

##### 7.5.4.2.2 1,28 Mcps TDD option

\(1\) Set the signal generator to produce an interfering signal at a
frequency offset Fuw from the assigned channel frequency of the wanted
signal which is given by

Fuw=±3,2 +/- n) x 1 MHz

where n shall be increased in integer steps from n = 0 up to such a
value that the center frequency of the interfering signal covers the
range from 1 MHz to 12,75 GHz. The interfering signal level measured at
the antenna connector shall be set in dependency of its center
frequency, as specified in tables 7.6A to 7.10A. The type of the
interfering signal is either equivalent to a continuous wideband CDMA
signal with one code of chip frequency 1,28 Mchip/s, filtered by an RRC
transmit pulse-shaping filter with roll-off α = 0,22, or a CW signal;
see tables 7.6A to 7.10A.

\(2\) Measure the BER of the wanted signal at the BS receiver.

\(3\) Interchange the connections of the BS Rx ports and repeat the
measurements according to steps (1) and (2).

In addition, for a multi-band capable BS with separate antenna
connectors, the following steps shall apply:

\(4\) For single band tests, repeat the steps above per involved band
with no carrier activated in the other band.

\(5\) The interfering signal shall first be applied on the same port as

### 7.5.5 Test Requirements

NOTE 1: If the Test Requirement below differs from the Minimum
Requirement, then the Test Tolerance applied for this test is non-zero.
The Test Tolerance for this test is defined in subclause 5.11 and the
explanation of how the Minimum Requirement has been relaxed by the Test
Tolerance is given in Annex D.

In all measurements made according to subclause 7.5.4.2, the BER shall
not exceed 0,001.

NOTE 2: Annex F describes the procedure for BER tests taking into
account the statistical consequence of frequent repetition of BER
measurements within the blocking test . The consequence is: a DUT
exactly on the limit may fail due to the statistical nature 2.55
times(mean value) in 12750 BER measurements using the predefined wrong
decision probability of 0.02%. If the fail cases are ≤12, it is allowed
to repeat the fail cases 1 time before the final verdict.

the presence of two or more interfering signals which have a specific
frequency relationship to the wanted signal.

#### 7.7.4.2 Procedure

##### 7.7.4.2.1 3,84 Mcps TDD option

\(1\) Measure the power of the spurious emissions by applying the
measuring equipment with the settings as specified in table 7.14. The
characteristics of the measurement filter with the bandwidth 3,84 MHz
shall be RRC with roll-off α = 0,22. The characteristics of the
measurement filters with bandwidths 100 kHz and 1 MHz shall be
approximately Gaussian (typical spectrum analyzer filter). The center
frequency of the filters shall be stepped in contiguous steps over the
frequency bands as specified in table 7.14 and table 7.14AA. The time
duration of each step shall be sufficiently long to capture one even
(transmit) time slot.

\(2\) If the BS is equipped with more than one Rx port, interchange the
connections of the BS Rx ports and repeat the measurement according to
(1).

##### 7.7.4.2.3 7,68 Mcps TDD option

\(1\) Measure the power of the spurious emissions by applying the
measuring equipment with the settings as specified in table 7.14B. The
characteristics of the measurement filter with the bandwidth 7,68 MHz
shall be RRC with roll-off α = 0,22. The characteristics of the
measurement filters with bandwidths 100 kHz and 1 MHz shall be
approximately Gaussian (typical spectrum analyzer filter). The center
frequency of the filters shall be stepped in contiguous steps over the
frequency bands as specified in table 7.14B and 7.14BB. The time
duration of each step shall be sufficiently long to capture one even
(transmit) time slot.

\(2\) If the BS is equipped with more than one Rx port, interchange the
connections of the BS Rx ports and repeat the measurement according to
(1).

### 7.7.5 Test Requirements

NOTE: If the Test Requirement below differs from the Minimum
Requirement, then the Test Tolerance applied for this test is non-zero.
The Test Tolerance for this test is defined in subclause 5.11 and the
explanation of how the Minimum Requirement has been relaxed by the Test
Tolerance is given in Annex D.

The spurious emissions measured according to subclause 7.7.4.2 shall not
exceed the limits specified in subclause 7.7.2.

8 Performance requirements
==========================

8.1 General
-----------

Performance requirements for the BS are specified for the measurement
channels defined in Annex A and the propagation conditions in Annex B.
The requirements only apply to those measurement channels that are
supported by the base station. The performance requirements for the high
speed train conditions defined in Annex B.3 are optional. All Bit Error
Ratio (BER) and Block Error ratio (BLER) measurements shall be carried
out according to the general rules for statistical testing defined in
ITU-T Recommendation O.153 \[10\] and Annex F.

Unless stated otherwise, performance requirements apply for a single
carrier only. Performance requirements for a BS supporting MC-HSUPA are
defined in terms of single carrier requirements.

The characteristics of the white noise source, simulating interference
from other cells (I~oc~), shall comply with the AWGN interferer
definition in subclause 5.18.

The requirements only apply to a base station with dual receiver antenna
diversity unless otherwise stated. The required Î~or~/I~oc~ shall be
applied separately at each antenna port.

8.2 Demodulation in static propagation conditions
-------------------------------------------------

### 8.2.1 Demodulation of DCH

#### 8.2.1.1 Definition and applicability

The performance requirement of DCH in static propagation conditions is
determined by the maximum Block Error Ratio (BLER) allowed when the
receiver input signal is at a specified Î~or~/I~oc~ limit. The BLER is
calculated for each of the measurement channels supported by the base
station.

In this subclause, different requirements shall apply to Wide Area BS,
Local Area BS and Home BS.

#### 8.2.1.2 Minimum Requirements

##### 8.2.1.2.1 3,84 Mcps TDD option

For the parameters specified in table 8.2, the BLER should not exceed
the piece-wise linear BLER curve specified in table 8.3. These
requirements are applicable for TFCS size 16.

The normative reference for this requirement is TS 25.105 \[1\]
subclause 8.2.1.1.3.

#### 8.2.1.3 Test purpose

The test purpose is to verify the ability of the BS to receive a
prescribed test signal under static propagation conditions with a BLER
not exceeding a specified limit. Within the wanted channel, intracell
interference sources as well as an additional intercell interference
source are taken into account. Therefore, this test - as all other tests
in clause 8 - mainly checks the ability of the signal processing part of
the receiver to extract the wanted signal from the interfered-with input
signal, whereas the tests in clause 7 concentrate on the receiver RF
part.

#### 8.2.1.4 Method of test

##### 8.2.1.4.1 Initial conditions

###### 8.2.1.4.1.0 General test conditions

Test environment: normal; see subclause 5.9.1.

RF channels to be tested: B, M and T; see subclause 5.3.

###### 8.2.1.4.1.1 3,84 Mcps TDD option

Connect the BS tester (UE simulator) generating the wanted signal and a
set of interference generators to both BS antenna connectors for
diversity reception via a combining network. The set of interference
generators comprises a number of CDMA generators, each representing an
individual intracell interferer (subsequently called DPCH~0~
generators), and an additional band-limited white noise source,
simulating interference from other cells. Each DPCH~0~ generator shall
produce an interfering signal that is equivalent to a valid UTRA TDD
signal with spreading factor 16, using the same time slot(s) than the
wanted signal and applying the same cell-specific scrambling code. The
number of the DPCH~0~ generators used in each test is given in table
8.2.

###### 8.2.1.4.1.2 1,28 Mcps TDD option

Connect the BS tester (UE simulator) generating the wanted signal and a
set of interference generators to both BS antenna connectors for
diversity reception via a combining network. The set of interference
generators comprises a number of CDMA generators, each representing an
individual intracell interferer (subsequently called DPCH~0~
generators), and an additional band-limited white noise source,
simulating interference from other cells. Each DPCH~0~ generator shall
produce an interfering signal that is equivalent to a valid UTRA TDD
signal with spreading factor 8, using the same time slot(s) than the
wanted signal and applying the same cell-specific scrambling code. The
number of the DPCH~0~ generators used in each test is given in table
8.2A.

###### 8.2.1.4.1.3 7,68 Mcps TDD option

Connect the BS tester (UE simulator) generating the wanted signal and a
set of interference generators to both BS antenna connectors for
diversity reception via a combining network. The set of interference
generators comprises a number of CDMA generators, each representing an
individual intracell interferer (subsequently called DPCH~0~
generators), and an additional band-limited white noise source,
simulating interference from other cells. Each DPCH~0~ generator shall
produce an interfering signal that is equivalent to a valid UTRA TDD
signal with spreading factor 32, using the same time slot(s) than the
wanted signal and applying the same cell-specific scrambling code. The
number of the DPCH~0~ generators used in each test is given in table
8.2B.

##### 8.2.1.4.2 Procedure

###### 8.2.1.4.2.1 3,84 Mcps TDD option

\(1\) Adjust the power of the band-limited white noise source in such a
way that its power spectral density measured at the BS antenna connector
takes on the value I~oc~ as specified in table 8.2.

\(2\) For a given test defined by the information data rate and the BLER
objective, set the power of each DPCH~0~ measured at the BS antenna
connector during the active time slots to the value specified in table
8.4.

\(3\) Set up a call between the BS tester generating the wanted signal
and the BS. The characteristics of the call shall be configured
according to the information data rate to be provided and the
corresponding UL reference measurement channel defined in Annex A.
Depending on the information data rate, the UL reference measurement
channel makes use of one or two Dedicated Physical Channels (DPCH~1~ and
DPCH~2~) with different spreading factors SF. The power(s) of DPCH~1~
and DPCH~2~ (if applicable) measured at the BS antenna connector during
the active time slots shall be set to the value(s) given in table 8.4.

\(4\) Measure the BLER of the wanted signal at the BS receiver.

The normative reference for this requirement is TS 25.105 \[1\]
subclause 8.3.1.1.3.

#### 8.3.1.3 Test purpose

The test purpose is to verify the ability of the BS to receive a
prescribed test signal under defined propagation conditions (multipath
fading Case 1) with a BLER not exceeding a specified limit. Within the
wanted channel, independent intracell interference sources as well as an
additional intercell interference source are taken into account.
Therefore, this test - as all other tests in clause 8 - mainly checks
the ability of the signal processing part of the receiver to extract the
wanted signal from the distorted and interfered-with input signal,
whereas the tests in clause 7 concentrate on the receiver RF part.

#### 8.3.1.4 Method of test

##### 8.3.1.4.1 Initial conditions

###### 8.3.1.4.1.0 General test conditions

Test environment: normal; see subclause 5.9.1.

RF channels to be tested: B, M and T; see subclause 5.3.

###### 8.3.1.4.1.1 3,84 Mcps TDD option

\(1\) Connect the BS tester (UE simulator) generating the wanted signal
and a set of interference generators to both BS antenna connectors for
diversity reception via a combining network. The set of interference
generators comprises a number of CDMA generators, each representing an
individual intracell interferer (subsequently called DPCH~0~
generators), and an additional band-limited white noise source,
simulating interference from other cells. Each DPCH~0~ generator shall
produce an interfering signal that is equivalent to a valid UTRA TDD
signal with spreading factor 16, using the same time slot(s) than the
wanted signal and applying the same cell-specific scrambling code. The
number of the DPCH~0~ generators used in each test is given in table
8.5.

\(2\) The wanted signal produced by the BS tester and the interfering
signals produced by the DPCH~0~ generators are individually passed
through independent Multipath Fading Simulators (MFS) before entering
the combining network. Each MFS shall be configured to simulate
multipath fading Case 1.

###### 8.3.1.4.1.3 7,68 Mcps TDD option

\(1\) Connect the BS tester (UE simulator) generating the wanted signal
and a set of interference generators to both BS antenna connectors for
diversity reception via a combining network. The set of interference
generators comprises a number of CDMA generators, each representing an
individual intracell interferer (subsequently called DPCH~0~
generators), and an additional band-limited white noise source,
simulating interference from other cells. Each DPCH~0~ generator shall
produce an interfering signal that is equivalent to a valid UTRA TDD
signal with spreading factor 32, using the same time slot(s) than the
wanted signal and applying the same cell-specific scrambling code. The
number of the DPCH~0~ generators used in each test is given in table
8.5B.

##### 8.3.1.4.2 Procedure

###### 8.3.1.4.2.1 3,84 Mcps TDD option

\(1\) Adjust the power of the band-limited white noise source in such a
way that its power spectral density measured at the BS antenna connector
takes on the value I~oc~ as specified in table 8.5.

\(2\) For a given test defined by the information data rate and the BLER
objective, set the power of each DPCH~0~ measured at the BS antenna
connector during the active time slots to the value specified in table
8.7.

\(3\) Set up a call between the BS tester generating the wanted signal
and the BS. The characteristics of the call shall be configured
according to the information data rate to be provided and the
corresponding UL reference measurement channel defined in Annex A.
Depending on the information data rate, the UL reference measurement
channel makes use of one or two Dedicated Physical Channels (DPCH~1~ and
DPCH~2~) with different spreading factors SF. The power(s) of DPCH~1~
and DPCH~2~ (if applicable) measured at the BS antenna connector during
the active time slots shall be set to the value(s) given in table 8.7.

\(4\) Measure the BLER of the wanted signal at the BS receiver.

limits specified in table 8.6B.

### 8.3.2 Multipath fading Case 2

#### 8.3.2.1 Definition and applicability

The performance requirement of DCH in multipath fading Case 2 is
determined by the maximum Block Error Ratio (BLER) allowed when the
receiver input signal is at a specified Î~or~/I~oc~ limit. The BLER is
calculated for each of the measurement channels supported by the base
station.

The requirements in this subclause shall apply to Wide Area BS only.
There is no requirement to test Local Area BS and Home BS in multipath
fading Case 2 conditions.

#### 8.3.2.2 Minimum Requirements

##### 8.3.2.2.1 3,84 Mcps TDD option

For the parameters specified in table 8.8, the BLER should not exceed
the piece-wise linear BLER curve specified in table 8.8. These
requirements are applicable for TFCS size 16.

subclause 8.3.2.1.3.

#### 8.3.2.3 Test purpose

The test purpose is to verify the ability of the BS to receive a
prescribed test signal under defined propagation conditions (multipath
fading Case 2) with a BLER not exceeding a specified limit. Within the
wanted channel, independent intracell interference sources as well as an
additional intercell interference source are taken into account.
Therefore, this test - as all other tests in clause 8 - mainly checks
the ability of the signal processing part of the receiver to extract the
wanted signal from the distorted and interfered-with input signal,
whereas the tests in clause 7 concentrate on the receiver RF part.

RF channels to be tested: B, M and T; see subclause 5.3.

###### 8.3.2.4.1.1 3,84 Mcps TDD option

\(1\) Connect the BS tester (UE simulator) generating the wanted signal
and a set of interference generators to both BS antenna connectors for
diversity reception via a combining network. The set of interference
generators comprises a number of CDMA generators, each representing an
individual intracell interferer (subsequently called DPCH~0~
generators), and an additional band-limited white noise source,
simulating interference from other cells. Each DPCH~0~ generator shall
produce an interfering signal that is equivalent to a valid UTRA TDD
signal with spreading factor 16, using the same time slot(s) than the
wanted signal and applying the same cell-specific scrambling code. The
number of the DPCH~0~ generators used in each test is given in table
8.8.

\(2\) The wanted signal produced by the BS tester and the interfering
signals produced by the DPCH~0~ generators are individually passed
through independent Multipath Fading Simulators (MFS) before entering
the combining network. Each MFS shall be configured to simulate
multipath fading Case 2.

##### 8.3.2.4.2 Procedure

###### 8.3.2.4.2.1 3,84 Mcps TDD option

\(1\) Adjust the power of the band-limited white noise source in such a
way that its power spectral density measured at the BS antenna connector
takes on the value I~oc~ as specified in table 8.8.

\(2\) For a given test defined by the information data rate and the BLER
objective, set the power of each DPCH~0~ measured at the BS antenna
connector during the active time slots to the value specified in table
8.101.

\(3\) Set up a call between the BS tester generating the wanted signal
and the BS. The characteristics of the call shall be configured
according to the information data rate to be provided and the
corresponding UL reference measurement channel defined in Annex A.
Depending on the information data rate, the UL reference measurement
channel makes use of one or two Dedicated Physical Channels (DPCH~1~ and
DPCH~2~) with different spreading factors SF. The power(s) of DPCH~1~
and DPCH~2~ (if applicable) measured at the BS antenna connector during
the active time slots shall be set to the value(s) given in table 8.10.

\(4\) Measure the BLER of the wanted signal at the BS receiver.

subclause 8.3.3.1.3.

#### 8.3.3.3 Test purpose

The test purpose is to verify the ability of the BS to receive a
prescribed test signal under defined propagation conditions (multipath
fading Case 3) with a BLER not exceeding a specified limit. Within the
wanted channel, independent intracell interference sources as well as an
additional intercell interference source are taken into account.
Therefore, this test - as all other tests in clause 8 - mainly checks
the ability of the signal processing part of the receiver to extract the
wanted signal from the distorted and interfered-with input signal,
whereas the tests in clause 7 concentrate on the receiver RF part.

#### 8.3.3.4 Method of test

##### 8.3.3.4.1 Initial conditions

###### 8.3.3.4.1.0 General test conditions

Test environment: normal; see subclause 5.9.1.

RF channels to be tested: B, M and T; see subclause 5.3.

###### 8.3.3.4.1.1 3,84 Mcps TDD option

\(1\) Connect the BS tester (UE simulator) generating the wanted signal
and a set of interference generators to both BS antenna connectors for
diversity reception via a combining network. The set of interference
generators comprises a number of CDMA generators, each representing an
individual intracell interferer (subsequently called DPCH~0~
generators), and an additional band-limited white noise source,
simulating interference from other cells. Each DPCH~0~ generator shall
produce an interfering signal that is equivalent to a valid UTRA TDD
signal with spreading factor 16, using the same time slot(s) than the
wanted signal and applying the same cell-specific scrambling code. The
number of the DPCH~0~ generators used in each test is given in table
8.11.

\(2\) The wanted signal produced by the BS tester and the interfering
signals produced by the DPCH~0~ generators are individually passed
through independent Multipath Fading Simulators (MFS) before entering
the combining network. Each MFS shall be configured to simulate
multipath fading Case 3.

###### 8.3.3.4.1.2 1,28 Mcps TDD option

\(1\) Connect the BS tester (UE simulator) generating the wanted signal
and a set of interference generators to both BS antenna connectors for
diversity reception via a combining network. The set of interference
generators comprises a number of CDMA generators, each representing an
individual intracell interferer (subsequently called DPCH~0~
generators), and an additional band-limited white noise source,
simulating interference from other cells. Each DPCH~0~ generator shall
produce an interfering signal that is equivalent to a valid UTRA TDD
signal with spreading factor 8, using the same time slot(s) than the
wanted signal and applying the same cell-specific scrambling code. The
number of the DPCH~0~ generators used in each test is given in table
8.11A.

\(2\) The wanted signal produced by the BS tester and the interfering
signals produced by the DPCH~0~ generators are individually passed
through independent Multipath Fading Simulators (MFS) before entering
the combining network. Each MFS shall be configured to simulate
multipath fading Case 3.

###### 8.3.3.4.1.3 7,68 Mcps TDD option

\(1\) Connect the BS tester (UE simulator) generating the wanted signal
and a set of interference generators to both BS antenna connectors for
diversity reception via a combining network. The set of interference
generators comprises a number of CDMA generators, each representing an
individual intracell interferer (subsequently called DPCH~0~
generators), and an additional band-limited white noise source,
simulating interference from other cells. Each DPCH~0~ generator shall
produce an interfering signal that is equivalent to a valid UTRA TDD
signal with spreading factor 32, using the same time slot(s) than the
wanted signal and applying the same cell-specific scrambling code. The
number of the DPCH~0~ generators used in each test is given in table
8.11B.

\(2\) The wanted signal produced by the BS tester and the interfering
signals produced by the DPCH~0~ generators are individually passed
through independent Multipath Fading Simulators (MFS) before entering
the combining network. Each MFS shall be configured to simulate
multipath fading Case 3.

##### 8.3.3.4.2 Procedure

###### 8.3.3.4.2.1 3,84 Mcps TDD option

\(1\) Adjust the power of the band-limited white noise source in such a
way that its power spectral density measured at the BS antenna connector
takes on the value I~oc~ as specified in table 8.11.

\(2\) For a given test defined by the information data rate and the BLER
objective, set the power of each DPCH~0~ measured at the BS antenna
connector during the active time slots to the value specified in table
8.13.

\(3\) Set up a call between the BS tester generating the wanted signal
and the BS. The characteristics of the call shall be configured
according to the information data rate to be provided and the
corresponding UL reference measurement channel defined in Annex A.
Depending on the information data rate, the UL reference measurement
channel makes use of one or two Dedicated Physical Channels (DPCH~1~ and
DPCH~2~) with different spreading factors SF. The power(s) of DPCH~1~
and DPCH~2~ (if applicable) measured at the BS antenna connector during
the active time slots shall be set to the value(s) given in table 8.131.

\(4\) Measure the BLER of the wanted signal at the BS receiver.

### **8.3A.3 Test purpose**

The test shall verify the receiver\'s ability to receive the test signal
in high speed train conditions with a BLER not exceeding the specified
limit.

### **8.3A.4 Method of test**

#### **8.3A.4.1 Initial conditions**

##### **8.3A.4.1.1 General test conditions**

Test environment: normal; see subclause 5.9.1

##### **8.3A.4.1.1** 1.28 **Mcps TDD option**

Connect the BS tester (UE simulator) generating the wanted signal ,
Channel Simulator generating Doppler shift and a set of interference
generators to both BS antenna connectors for diversity reception via a
combining network. The set of interference generators comprises a number
of CDMA generators, each representing an individual intracell interferer
(subsequently called DPCH~0~ generators), and an additional band-limited
white noise source, simulating interference from other cells. Each
DPCH~0~ generator shall produce an interfering signal that is equivalent
to a valid UTRA TDD signal with spreading factor 8, using the same time
slot(s) than the wanted signal and applying the same cell-specific
scrambling code. The number of the DPCH~0~ generators used in each test
is given in table 8.13C.

##### **8.3A.4.2.1 3.84 Mcps TDD option**

(void)

##### **8.3A.4.2.2 1.28 Mcps TDD option**

\(1\) Adjust the power of the band-limited white noise source in such a
way that its power spectral density measured at the BS antenna connector
takes on the value I~oc~ as specified in table 8.13C.

\(2\) For a given test defined by the information data rate and the BLER
objective, set the power of each DPCH~0~ measured at the BS antenna
connector during the active time slots to the value specified in table
8.13E.

\(4\) The Channel Simulator shall be configured according to the
corresponding Doppler shift trajectories defined in annex B.

\(5\) Set up a call between the BS tester generating the wanted signal
and the BS. The characteristics of the call shall be configured
according to the information data rate to be provided and the
corresponding UL reference measurement channel defined in Annex A.
Depending on the information data rate, the UL reference measurement
channel makes use of one or two Dedicated Physical Channels (DPCH~1~ and
DPCH~2~) with different spreading factors SF. The power(s) of DPCH~1~
and DPCH~2~ (if applicable) measured at the BS antenna connector during
the active time slots shall be set to the value(s) given in table 8.13E.

\(6\) Measure the BLER of the wanted signal at the BS receiver.

##### 8.5.1.2.3 Test purpose

The test shall verify the receiver's ability to receive the test signal
under static propagation conditions with an error ratio not exceeding a
specified limit.

##### 8.5.1.2.4 Method of test

###### 8.5.1.2.4.1 Initial conditions

> Test environment: normal; see subclause 5.9.1.
>
> RF channels to be tested: B, M and T; see subclause 5.3

\(1\) Connect the BS tester generating the wanted signal and AWGN
generators to both BS antenna connectors for diversity reception via a
combining network as shown in annex B. Connect the BS tester (UE
simulator) generating the wanted signal and a set of interference
generators to both BS antenna connectors for diversity reception via a
combining network. The set of interference generators comprises a number
of CDMA generators, each representing an individual intracell interferer
(subsequently called DPCH0 generators), and an additional band-limited
white noise source, simulating interference from other cells. Each DPCH0
generator shall produce an interfering signal that is equivalent to a
valid UTRA TDD signal with spreading factor 8, using the same time
slot(s) than the wanted signal and applying the same cell-specific
scrambling code. The number of the DPCH0 generators used in each test is
given in table 8.17A.

###### 8.5.1.2.4.2 Procedure

\(1\) Adjust the power of the band-limited white noise source in such a
way that its power spectral density measured at the BS antenna connector
takes on the value Ioc as specified in table 8.17A.

\(2\) The characteristics of the wanted signal (HS-SICH) shall be
configured according to the corresponding UL reference measurement
channel defined in annex A. Set the power of HS-SICH and each DPCH0
measured at the BS antenna connector during the active time slots to the
value specified in table 8.17A.

\(3\) The test signal generator sends the ACKs with HS-SICH and DPCH0s.
Adjust the equipment so that required
$\frac{{\hat{I}}_{\text{or}}}{I_{\text{oc}}}$ specified in table 8.18A
is achieved The receiver tries to detect ACK. The error ratio is
calculated for the ACKs that have been detected.

##### 8.5.1.2.5 Test requirements

The performance of ACK error detection, P(ACK-\>NACK) should not exceed
the required error ratio for the
$\frac{{\hat{I}}_{\text{or}}}{I_{\text{oc}}}$specified in Table 8.19A.

##### 8.5.2.2.3 Test purpose

The test shall verify the receiver's ability to receive the test signal
under multipath fading propagation conditions with an error ratio not
exceeding a specified limit.

##### 8.5.2.2.4 Method of test

###### 8.5.2.2.4.1 Initial conditions

> Test environment: normal; see subclause 5.9.1.
>
> RF channels to be tested: B, M and T; see subclause 5.3

\(1\) Connect the BS tester generating the wanted signal and AWGN
generators to both BS antenna connectors for diversity reception via a
combining network as shown in annex B. Connect the BS tester (UE
simulator) generating the wanted signal and a set of interference
generators to both BS antenna connectors for diversity reception via a
combining network. The set of interference generators comprises a number
of CDMA generators, each representing an individual intracell interferer
(subsequently called DPCH0 generators), and an additional band-limited
white noise source, simulating interference from other cells. Each DPCH0
generator shall produce an interfering signal that is equivalent to a
valid UTRA TDD signal with spreading factor 8, using the same time
slot(s) than the wanted signal and applying the same cell-specific
scrambling code. The number of the DPCH0 generators used in each test is
given in table 8.20A.

\(2\) The wanted signal produced by the BS tester and the interfering
signals produced by the DPCH0 generators are individually passed through
independent Multipath Fading Simulators (MFS) before entering the
combining network. Each MFS shall be configured to simulate multipath
fading Case 3.

###### 8.5.2.2.4.2 Procedure

\(1\) Adjust the power of the band-limited white noise source in such a
way that its power spectral density measured at the BS antenna connector
takes on the value Ioc as specified in table 8.20A.

\(2\) The characteristics of the wanted signal (HS-SICH) shall be
configured according to the corresponding UL reference measurement
channel defined in annex A. Set the power of HS-SICH and each DPCH0
measured at the BS antenna connector during the active time slots to the
value specified in table 8.20A.

\(3\) The test signal generator sends the ACKs with HS-SICH and DPCH0s.
Adjust the equipment so that required
$\frac{{\hat{I}}_{\text{or}}}{I_{\text{oc}}}$ specified in table 8.21A
is achieved The receiver tries to detect ACK. The error ratio is
calculated for the ACKs that have been detected.

##### 8.5.2.2.5 Test requirements

The performance of ACK error detection, P(ACK-\>NACK) should not exceed
the required error ratio for the
$\frac{{\hat{I}}_{\text{or}}}{I_{\text{oc}}}$specified in Table 8.22A.

######## Annex B (normative): Propagation conditions

B.1 Static propagation condition
================================

The propagation for the static performance measurement is an Additive
White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) environment. No fading and multi-paths exist
for this propagation model.

B.3 High speed train conditions
===============================

High speed train conditions are as follows:

> Scenario 1: Open space
>
> Scenario 3: Tunnel for multi-antennas

The high speed train conditions for the test of the baseband performance
are two non-fading propagation channels in both scenarios.

Doppler shift for both scenarios is given by:

$f_{s}\left( t \right) = f_{d}\text{cos}\theta\left( t \right)$ (B.1)

where $f_{s}\left( t \right)$ is the Doppler shift and $f_{d}$ is the
maximum Doppler frequency. The cosine of angle
$\theta\left( t \right)$is given by:

$\text{cos}\theta\left( t \right) = \frac{D_{s}/2 - \text{vt}}{\sqrt{D_{\text{min}^{2}} + \left( D_{s}/2 - \text{vt} \right)^{2}}}$,
$0 \leq t \leq D_{s}/v$ (B.2)

$\text{cos}\theta\left( t \right) = \frac{- 1\text{.}5D_{s} + \text{vt}}{\sqrt{D_{\text{min}^{2}} + \left( - 1\text{.}5D_{s} + \text{vt} \right)^{2}}}$,
$D_{s}/v < t \leq 2D_{s}/v$ (B.3)

$\text{cos}\theta\left( t \right) = \text{cos}\theta\left( t\text{\ \ }\text{mod}(2D_{s}/v) \right)$,
$t > 2D_{s}/v$ (B.4)

where $D_{s}/2$ is the initial distance of the train from BS, and
$D_{\text{min}}$ is BS-Railway track distance, both in meters; $v$ is
the velocity of the train in m/s, $t$ is time in seconds.

Doppler shift and cosine angle is given by equation B.1 and B.2-B.4
respectively, where the required input parameters listed in table B.6
and the resulting Doppler shift shown in Figure B.1 and B.2 are applied
for all frequency bands.

######## Annex C (normative): Global in-channel Tx test

C.1 General
===========

The global in-channel Tx test enables the measurement of all relevant
parameters that describe the in-channel quality of the output signal of
the Tx under test in a single measurement process.

The parameters describing the in-channel quality of a transmitter,
however, are not necessarily independent. The algorithm chosen for
description inside this annex places particular emphasis on the
exclusion of all interdependencies among the parameters. Any other
algorithm (e.g. having better computational efficiency) may be applied,
as long as the results are the same within the accuracy limits.

All notes referred to in the various subclauses of C.2 are put together
in clause C.3

C.2 Definition of the process
=============================

C.2.1 Basic principle
---------------------

The process is based on the comparison of the actual **output signal of
the Tx under test**, received by an ideal receiver, with a **reference
signal**, that is generated by the measuring equipment and represents an
ideal error free received signal. The reference signal shall be composed
of the same number of codes at the correct spreading factors as
contained in the test signal. Note, for simplification, the notation
below assumes only codes of one spreading factor although the algorithm
is valid for signals containing multiple spreading factors. All signals
are represented as equivalent (generally complex) base band signals.

C.2.2 Output signal of the Tx under test 
----------------------------------------

The output signal of the Tx under test is acquired by the measuring
equipment, filtered by a matched filter (RRC characteristic with
roll-off α = 0,22, correct in shape and in position on the frequency
axis) and stored for further processing.

The following form represents the physical signal in the entire
measurement interval:

one vector **Z**, containing N = ns x sf + ma complex samples;

with

ns: [n]{.underline}umber of [s]{.underline}ymbols in the measurement
interval;

sf: number of chips per symbol. (sf: [s]{.underline}preading
[f]{.underline}actor) (see Note: Symbol length)

ma: number of [m]{.underline}id[a]{.underline}mble chips, or for IMB the
number of chips in the TDM pilot region

C.2.3 Reference signal
----------------------

The reference signal is constructed by the measuring equipment according
to the relevant Tx specifications.

It is filtered by the same matched filter, mentioned in C.2.2, and
stored at the intersymbol interference free instants. The following form
represents the reference signal in the entire measurement interval:

one vector **R**, containing N = ns x sf + ma complex samples;

where ns, sf and ma have the same meaning as defined above in C.2.2.

C.2.4 Classification of measurement results
-------------------------------------------

The measurement results achieved by the global in-channel Tx test can be
classified into two types:

• **Results of type \"deviation\"**, where the error-free parameter has
a non-zero magnitude. (These are the parameters that represent the
signal). These parameters are:

RF Frequency

Power (in case of single code)

Code Domain Power (in case of multi-code)

Timing (only for UE) (see Note: Deviation)

(Additional parameters: see Note: Deviation)

• **Results of type \"residual\"**, where the error-free parameter has
value zero. (These are the parameters that represent the error values of
the measured signal; ideally, their magnitude is zero). These parameters
are:

Error Vector Magnitude (EVM)

Peak Code Domain Error (PCDE)

(Additional parameters: see Note: Residual)

C.2.5 Process definition to achieve results of type \"deviation\"
-----------------------------------------------------------------

The reference signal (**R**; see subclause C.2.3) and the signal under
Test (Z; see subclause C.2.2) are varied with respect to the parameters
mentioned in subclause C.2.4 under \"results of type deviation\" in
order to achieve best fit. Best fit is achieved when the RMS difference
value between the varied signal under test and the varied reference
signal is an absolute minimum.

Overview:

$\text{FCT}\lbrack Z(\overset{\sim}{f},\overset{\sim}{t},\overset{\sim}{\phi},g_{1},g_{2},\text{.}\text{.}\text{.},g_{\text{synch}}) - R(f,t,\phi,{\overset{\sim}{g}}_{1},{\overset{\sim}{g}}_{2},\text{.}\text{.}\text{.},{\overset{\sim}{g}}_{\text{synch}})\rbrack = \text{Minimum}!$

Z: Signal under test.

R Reference signal,

with frequency f, the timing t, the phase ϕ, gain of code1 (g~1~), gain
of code2 (g~2~) etc, and the gain of the synch channel g~synch~

The parameters marked with a tilde in Z and R are varied in order to
achieve a best fit.

**R'** and **Z'** are each of length ns \* sf and depending on the
length of the measurement interval result of possibly multiple
successive applications of the minimum process.

Detailed formula: see Note: Formula for the minimum process

The varied reference signal, after the best-fit process, will be called
**R'.**

The varied signal under test, after the best fit process, will be called
**Z'.**

**R'** and **Z'** are each of length ns \* sf and depending on the
length of the measurement interval result of possibly multiple
successive applications of the minimum process.

Those parameter values, which - after the best-fit process -lead to **R'
and Z',** represent directly the wanted results of type \"deviation\".
These parameter values are expressed as deviations from the reference
value, using the same units as the corresponding reference value.

In the case of multi-code transmission, the best-fit process of the type
\"deviation\" parameters frequency, timing (and any additional parameter
as e.g. RF phase) is not done with respect to the individual codes, but
commonly for the complete code set used; therefore, the process returns
one measurement value only for each parameter.

(These parameters are [not]{.underline} varied on the individual codes
signals such that the process would return kr frequency errors\... .
(kr: number of codes in the reference signal)).

The only type-\"deviation\"-parameters varied individually are the code
domain gain factors (g1, g2, ...)

### C.2.5.1 Decision Point Power

The mean-square value of the signal-under-test, sampled at the best
estimate of the of Intersymbol-Interference-free points using the
process defined in subclause 2.5, is referred to the *Decision Point
Power* (DPP):

### C.2.5.2 Code-Domain Power

The samples, Z', are separated into symbol intervals to create ns
time-sequential vectors **z** with sf complex samples comprising one
symbol interval. The *Code Domain Power* is calculated according to the
following steps:

1\) Take the vectors **z** defined above.

2\) To achieve meaningful results it is necessary to descramble **z,**
leading to **z'**

3\) Take the orthogonal vectors of the channelization code set **C**
(all codes belonging to one spreading factor) as defined in TS 25.213
and TS 25.223 (range +1, -1), and normalize by the norm of the vectors
to produce **C**norm=**C**/sqrt(sf). (see Note: Symbol length)

4\) Calculate the inner product of **z'** with **C**norm**.**. Do this
for all symbols of the measurement interval and for all codes in the
code space.\
This gives an array of format k x ns, each value representing a specific
symbol and a specific code, which can be exploited in a variety of ways.

k: total number of codes in the code space

ns: number of symbols in the measurement interval

5\) Calculate k mean-square values, each mean-square value unifying ns
symbols within one code.\
(These values can be called \"*Absolute CodeDomainPower* (CDP)\"
\[Volt^2^\].) The sum of the k values of CDP is equal to DPP.

6\) Normalize by the decision point power to obtain

C.2.6 Process definition to achieve results of type \"residual\"
----------------------------------------------------------------

The difference between the varied reference signal (**R'**; see
subclauseC.2.5.) and the varied Tx signal under test (**Z**; see
subclause C.2.2) is the error vector **E** versus time:

**E** = **Z'** - **R'.**

Depending on the parameter to be evaluated, it is appropriate to
represent **E** in one of the following two different forms:

**[Form EVM]{.underline}** (representing the physical error signal in
the entire measurement interval)

One vector **E**, containing N = ns x sf + ma complex samples;

where ns, sf and ma have the same meaning as defined above in C.2.2.

**[Form PCDE]{.underline}** (derived from Form EVM by separating the
samples into symbol intervals)

ns time-sequential vectors **e** with sf complex samples comprising one
symbol interval.

**E** gives results of type \"residual\" applying the two algorithms
defined in subclauses C.2.6.1 and C.2.6.2.

### C.2.6.1 Error Vector Magnitude (EVM)

The Error Vector Magnitude EVM is calculated according to the following
steps:

1\) Take the error vector **E** defined in subclause C.2.6 (Form EVM)
and calculate the RMS value of **E**; the result will be called
RMS(**E**).

2\) Take the varied reference vector **R** defined in subclause C.2.3
and calculate the RMS value of **R**; the result will be called
RMS(**R**).

3\) Calculate EVM according to:

![](media/image66.wmf){width="1.75in" height="0.4583333333333333in"}
(here, EVM is relative and expressed in %)

(see Note: TDD)

(see Note: Formula for EVM)

### C.2.6.2 Peak Code Domain Error (PCDE)

The Peak Code Domain Error is calculated according to the following
steps:

1\) Take the error vectors **e** defined in subclause C.2.6 (Form PCDE)

2\) Take the orthogonal vectors of the spreading code set C (all codes
belonging to one spreading factor) as defined in TS 25.213 and TS 25.223
(range +1, -1). (see Note: Symbol length) and normalize by the norm of
the vectors to produce **C**norm= **C**/sqrt(sf). (see Note: Symbol
length)

3\) To achieve meaningful results, it is necessary to descramble **e,**
leading to **e'**

4\) Calculate the inner product of e' with **C**norm. Do this for all
symbols of the measurement interval and for all codes in the code
space.\
This gives an array of format k x ns, each value representing an
error-vector representing a specific symbol and a specific code, which
can be exploited in a variety of ways.

k: total number of codes in the code space

ns: number of symbols in the measurement interval

5\) Calculate k RMS values, each RMS value unifying n symbols within one
code.\
(These values can be called \"Absolute CodeEVMs\" \[Volt\].)

6\) Find the peak value among the k \"absolute Code-EVMs\".\
(This value can be called \"Absolute PeakCodeEVM\" \[Volt\].)

7\) Calculate PCDE according to:

![](media/image67.wmf){width="3.0416666666666665in"
height="0.5138888888888888in"}. (a relative value in dB).

see Note: TDD

see Note: Synch channel

### C.2.6.3 Relative Code Domain Error (RCDE)

The Relative Code Domain Error is calculated for a wanted code according
to the following steps:

1\) Calculate the value \"*Absolute CodeEVM*\" \[Volt\] for the wanted
code according to C.2.6.2, as an RMS value unifying ns = 2400 symbols
corresponding to the measurement interval of one timeslot.

2\) Calculate the value \"*Absolute CodeDomainPower* (CDP)\" \[Volt^2^\]
for the wanted code according to C.2.5.2, with ns = 2400 symbols
corresponding to the measurement interval of one timeslot.

3\) Calculate RCDE according to:

4\) The average RCDE across a set of wanted codes is defined as the mean
of the linear RCDE values and subsequently expressed in dB.

C.3 Notes
=========

C.3.1 Symbol length
-------------------

A general code-multiplexed signal is multi-code and multi-rate. In order
to avoid unnecessary complexity, the measurement applications use a
unique symbol-length, corresponding to a specific spreading factor,
regardless of the really intended spreading factor. Nevertheless, the
complexity with a multi-code / multi-rate signal can be mastered by
introducing appropriate definitions.

C.3.2 Deviation
---------------

It is conceivable to regard more parameters as type „deviation\", e.g.
chip clock and RF phase. However, because chip clock and RF frequency
are linked together by a statement in the core specifications \[1\], it
is sufficient to process RF frequency only.

The parameter RF phase must be varied within the best-fit process
(C.2.5). Although necessary, this parameter-variation does not describe
any error, as the modulation schemes used in the system do not depend on
an absolute RF-phase.

The parameter Timing must be varied within the best fit process (C.2.5.)
This parameter variation does not describe any error, when applied to
the Node B test. However when applied to the UE test, it describes the
error of the UE's Timing Advance.

C.3.3 Residual
--------------

It is conceivable to regard more parameters as type „residual\", e.g. IQ
origin offset. As it is not the intention of the test to separate for
different error sources, but to quantify the quality of the signal, all
such parameters are not extracted by the best-fit process, instead
remain part of EVM and PCDE.

C.3.4 TDD
---------

EVM covers the midamble (or for IMB the TDM pilot region) part as well
as the data part; however PCDE disregards the midamble (or IMB TDM
pilot) part.

C.3.5 Synch channel
-------------------

A node B signal contains a physical synch channel, which is
non-orthogonal, related to the other DPCHs. In this context note: The
code channel bearing the result of PCDE is exactly one of the DPCHs
(never the synch channel). The origin of PCDE (erroneous code power) can
be any DPCH and/or the synch channel. This means that the error due to
the synch channel is projected onto the other (orthogonal) codes that
make up the code domain.

C.3.6 Formula for the minimum process
-------------------------------------

$L(\Delta\overset{\sim}{f},\Delta\overset{\sim}{t},\Delta\overset{\sim}{\phi},\Delta{\overset{\sim}{g}}_{c},\text{.}\text{.}\text{.},\Delta{\overset{\sim}{g}}_{\text{prim}},\Delta{\overset{\sim}{g}}_{\text{sec}i},\Delta{\overset{\sim}{g}}_{\text{mid}}) = \sum_{\nu = 0}^{N - 1}{|Z(\nu) - R(\nu)}|^{2}$

where

L is the function to be minimised

The parameters to be varied in order to minimize are:

$\Delta\overset{\sim}{f}$ the RF frequency offset

$\Delta\overset{\sim}{t}$ the timing offset

$\Delta\overset{\sim}{\phi}$ the phase offset

$\Delta{\overset{\sim}{g}}_{c}\text{.}\text{.}\text{.}$ code power
offsets (one offset for each code)

$\Delta{\overset{\sim}{g}}_{\text{mid}}$ the power offset of the
midamble (or for IMB the TDM pilot region)

$\Delta{\overset{\sim}{g}}_{\text{prim}}$ the code power offset of the
primary SCH

$\Delta{\overset{\sim}{g}}_{\text{sec}i}$ the code power offsets of
secondary SCHs, (i: 1,2,3)

($\Delta{\overset{\sim}{g}}_{\text{prim}}$ and
$\Delta{\overset{\sim}{g}}_{\text{sec}i}$ are only applied, if the
timeslot under test contains the synchronisation channel.)

Z(ν) Samples of the signal under Test

R(ν) Samples of the reference signal

$\sum_{\nu = 0}^{N - 1}{}$ counting index $\nu$starting at the beginning
of the measurement interval and ending at its end.

N No of chips during the measurement interval.

Z(ν): Samples of the signal under Test. It is modelled as a sequence of
complex baseband samples Z(γ) with a time-shift ∆t, a frequency offset
∆f, a phase offset ∆ϕ, the latter three with respect to the reference
signal.

$Z(\nu) = Z(\nu - \Delta\overset{\sim}{t}) \ast e^{- j2\text{πΔ}\overset{\sim}{f}\nu} \ast e^{- \text{jΔ}\overset{\sim}{\phi}}$

R(ν): Samples of the reference signal:

$\text{codes} + (g_{\text{prim}} + \Delta{\overset{\sim}{g}}_{\text{prim}}) \ast \text{Chip}_{\text{prim}}(\nu) + (g_{\text{sec}i} + \Delta{\overset{\sim}{g}}_{\text{sec}i}) \ast \text{Chip}_{\text{sec}i}(\nu) + (g_{\text{mid}} + \Delta{\overset{\sim}{g}}_{\text{mid}}) \ast \text{Chip}_{\text{mid}}(\nu)$

where

g nominal gain of the code channel or midamble (or for IMB the TDM pilot
region)

$\Delta\overset{\sim}{g}$ The gain offset to be varied in the minimum
process

Chip(ν) is the chip sequence of the code channel or midamble (or for IMB
the TDM pilot region)

Indices at g, Δg and Chip: The index indicates the code channel:

c = 1,2,\... No of code channels

prim = primary SCH

seci = three secondary SCHs, i:1,2,3

Range for Chip~c~ : +1,-1

C.3.7 Formula for EVM
---------------------

$\text{EVM} = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{\nu = 0}^{N - 1}{|Z^{'}(\gamma) - R^{'}(\gamma)}|^{2}}{\sum_{\nu = 0}^{N - 1}{|R^{'}(\gamma)}|^{2}}} \ast \text{100}\text{\%}$

Z'(γ), R'(γ) are the varied measured and reference signals.

######## Annex D (informative): Derivation of Test Requirements

The Test Requirements in this specification have been calculated by
relaxing the Minimum Requirements of the core specification using the
Test Tolerances defined in subclause 5.11. When the Test Tolerance is
zero, the Test Requirement will be the same as the Minimum Requirement.
When the Test Tolerance is non-zero, the Test Requirements will differ
from the Minimum Requirements, and the formula used for this relaxation
is given in tables D.1 to D.3

Note that a formula for applying Test Tolerances is provided for all
tests, even those with a test tolerance of zero. This is necessary in
the case that the Test System uncertainty is greater than that allowed
in subclause 5.10. In this event, the excess error shall be subtracted
from the defined test tolerance in order to generate the correct
tightened Test Requirements as defined in subclause 5.12.

For example, a Test System having 0,9 dB accuracy for test 6.2 Maximum
output power (which is 0,2 dB above the limit specified in subclause
5.10.2) would subtract 0,2 dB from the Test Tolerance of 0,7 dB defined
in subclause 5.11.1. This new test tolerance of 0,5 dB would then be
applied to the Minimum Requirement using the formula defined in Table
D.1 to give a new range of ±2,5 dB of the manufacturer's rated output
power.

For the case where an excess error of 0.2 dB exists, when applied to a
test with a test tolerance of zero, the test tolerance used in the
formula would be -0.2 dB.

######## Annex E (informative): Acceptable uncertainty of Test Equipment

This informative annex specifies the critical parameters of the
components of an overall Test System (e.g. Signal generators, Signal
Analysers etc.) which are necessary when assembling a Test System which
complies with subclause 5.10 Acceptable Uncertainty of Test System.
These Test Equipment parameters are fundamental to the accuracy of the
overall Test System and are unlikely to be improved upon through System
Calibration.

######## Annex F (normative): General rules for statistical testing

F.1 Statistical testing of receiver BER/BLER performance
========================================================

F.1.1 Error Definition
----------------------

Bit Error Ration (BER) and Block Error Ratio (BLER) are defined in
section 3.1.

F.1.2 Test Method
-----------------

Each test is performed in the following manner:

a\) Setup the required test conditions.

b\) Record the number of samples tested and the number of occurred
events (bit error or block error)

c\) Stop the test at a stop criterion which is minimum test time or an
early pass or an early fail event.

d\) Once the test is stopped decide according to the pass fail decision
rules ( subclause F.1.7)

F.1.3 Test Criteria
-------------------

The test shall fulfil the following requirements:

a\) good pass fail decision

1\) to keep reasonably low the probability (risk) of passing a bad unit
for each individual test;

2\) to have high probability of passing a good unit for each individual
test;

b\) good balance between test time and statistical significance

3\) to perform measurements with a high degree of statistical
significance;

4\) to keep the test time as low as possible.

F.1.4 Calculation assumptions
-----------------------------

### F.1.4.1 Statistical independence

a\) It is assumed, that error events are rare (lim BER BLER  0)
independent statistical events. However the memory of the convolutional
/turbo coder is terminated after oneTTI. Samples and errors are summed
up everyTTI. So the assumption of independent error events is justified.

b\) In the BLER test with fading there is the memory of the multipath
fading channel which interferes the statistical independence. A minimum
test time is introduced to average fluctuations of the multipath fading
channel. So the assumption of independent error events is justified
approximately.

### F.1.4.2 Applied formulas

The formulas, applied to describe the BER BLER test, are based on the
following experiments:

1\) After having observed a certain number of errors (**ne**) the number
of samples are counted to calculate BER BLER. Provisions are made (note
1) such that the complementary experiment is valid as well:

2\) After a certain number of samples (**ns**) the number of errors,
occurred, are counted to calculate BER BLER.

Experiment 1) stipulates to use the following Chi Square Distribution
with degree of freedom ne:

2\*dchisq(2\*NE,2\*ne).

Experiment 2) stipulates to use the Poisson Distribution:

dpois(ne,NE)

(NE: mean of the distribution)

To determine the early stop conditions, the following inverse cumulative
operation is applied:

0.5 \* qchisq(D,2\*ne). This is applicable for experiment (1) and (2).

D: wrong decision risk per test step

Note: other inverse cumulative operations are available, however only
this is suited for experiment (1) and (2).

### F.1.4.3 Approximation of the distribution

The test procedure is as follows:

During a running measurement for a BS ns (number of samples) and ne
(number of errors) are accumulated and from this the preliminary BER
BLER is calculated. Then new samples up to the next error are taken. The
entire past and the new samples are basis for the next preliminary BER
BLER. Depending on the result at every step, the BS can pass, can fail
or must continue the test.

As early pass- and early fail-BSs leave the statistical totality under
consideration, the experimental conditions are changed every step
resulting in a distribution that is truncated more and more towards the
end of the entire test. Such a distribution can not any more be handled
analytically. The unchanged distribution is used as an approximation to
calculate the early fail and early pass bounds.

F.1.5 Definition of good pass fail decision
-------------------------------------------

This is defined by the probability of wrong decision F at the end of the
test. The probability of a correct decision is 1-F.

The probability (risk) to fail a good DUT shall be ≤ F according to the
following definition: The failed DUT is still better than the specified
error ratio (Test requirement)with a probability of ≤ F.

The probability to pass a bad DUT shall be ≤ F according to the
following definition: The passed DUT is still worse than M times the
specified error ratio (M\>1 is the bad DUT factor) with a probability of
≤ F.

This definitions lead to an early pass and an early fail limit:

Early fail: ber≥ berlim~fail~

$\text{ber}\text{lim}_{\text{fail}}(D,\text{ne}) = \frac{2 \ast \text{ne}}{\text{qchisq}(D,2 \ast \text{ne})}$
(1)

For ne≥ 7

Early pass: ber ≤berlimbad~pass~

$\text{ber}\text{lim}\text{bad}_{\text{pass}}(D,\text{ne}) = \frac{2 \ast \text{ne} \ast M}{\text{qchisq}(1 - D,2 \ast \text{ne})}$
(2)

For ne ≥ 1

With

ber (normalized BER,BLER): BER,BLER according to F.1.1 divided by Test
requirement

evaluated fraction of F, the wrong decision probability at the end of
the test. See table F.1.

F.1.6 Good balance between test time and statistical significance
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Three independent test parameters are introduced into the test and shown
in Table F.1. These are the obvious basis of test time and statistical
significance. From the first two of them four dependent test parameters
are derived. The third independent test parameter is justified
separately.

The minimum test time is derived from the following justification:

1\) For no propagation conditions and static propagation condition

No early fail calculated from fractional number of errors \<1 (see note
1)

2\) For multipath fading condition

> No stop of the test until \[990\] wavelengths are crossed during
> relevant BS reception timeslots, relevant for BER BLER testing, with
> the speed given in the fading profile.

3\) For high speed train condition

> Scenario 1: 82.3s. This corresponds to 4 complete cycles of approach
> towards and departure leave to and from a BS antenna
>
> Scenario 3: 28.8s. This corresponds to 4 complete cycles of approach
> towards and departure from a BS antenna

TSPF and TSRX form the prolongation factor and depend on the user data
rate and the TDD Option (3,84 Mchip/s or 1,28 Mchip/s )

In tables F.4 and F.5 the minimum test time is converted in minimum
number of samples.

F.1.7 Pass fail decision rules
------------------------------

No decision is allowed before the minimum test time is elapsed.

1\) If minimum Test time \< time for target number of error events then
the following applies: The required confidence level 1-F (= correct
decision probability) shall be achieved. This is fulfilled at an early
pass or early fail event.

**For BER:**

For every TTI (Transmit Time Interval) sum up the number of bits (ns)
and the number if errors (ne) from the beginning of the test and
calculate

BER~1~ (including the artificial error at the beginning of the test
(Note 1))and

BER~0~ (excluding the artificial error at the beginning of the test
(Note 1)).

If BER~0~ is above the early fail limit, fail the DUT.

If BER~1~ is below the early pass limit, pass the DUT.

Otherwise continue the test

**For BLER:**

For every TTI sum up the number of blocks (ns) and the number of
erroneous blocks (ne) from the beginning of the test and calculate

BLER~1~ (including the artificial error at the beginning of the test
(Note 1))and

BLER~0~ (excluding the artificial error at the beginning of the test
(Note 1)).

If BLER~1~ is below the early pass limit, pass the DUT.

If BLER~0~ is above the early fail limit, fail the DUT.

Otherwise continue the test

2\) If the minimum test time ≥ time for target error events, then the
test runs for the minimum test time and the decision is done by
comparing the result with the test limit.

**For BER:**

For every TTI (Transmit Time Interval) sum up the number of bits (ns)
and the number if errors (ne) from the beginning of the test and
calculate BER~0~

**For BLER:**

For every TTI sum up the number of blocks (ns) and the number of
erroneous blocks (ne) from the beginning of the test and calculate
BLER~0~

If BER~0~/BLER~0~ is above the test limit, fail the DUT.

If BER~0~/BLER~0~ is on or below the test limit, pass the DUT.

F.1.9 Practical Use (informative)
---------------------------------

See figure F.1:

\- The early fail limit represents formula (1) in F.1.5. The range of
validity is ne≥7 ( ≥8 in case of blocking test) to ne =345

\- The early pass limit represents formula (2) in F.1.5. The range of
validity is ne=1 to ne =345. See note 1

\- The intersection co-ordinates of both curves are : target number of
errors ne =345 and test limit TL =1.234.

\- The range of validity for TL is ne\>345.

A typical BER BLER test, calculated from the number of samples and
errors (F.1.2.(b)) using experimental method (1) or (2) (see F.1.4.2
calculation assumptions) runs along the yellow trajectory. With an
errorless sample the trajectory goes down vertically. With an erroneous
sample it jumps up right. The tester checks if the BER BLER test
intersects the early fail or early pass limits. The real time processing
can be reduced by the following actions:

BLER~0~ (excluding the artificial error at the beginning of the test
(Note 1)). is calculated only in case of an error event.

BER~0~ (excluding the artificial error at the beginning of the test
(Note 1)). is calculated only in case of an error event within a TTI.

So the early fail limit cannot be missed by errorless samples.

The check against the early pass limit may be done by transforming
formula (2) in F.1.5 such that the tester checks against a
[L]{.underline}imit-[N]{.underline}umber-of-samples ( NL(ne)) depending
on the current number of errors (including the artificial error at the
beginning of the test (Note 1)).

Early pass if

$\text{NL}(\text{ne}) \geq \frac{\text{qchisq}(1 - D,2 \ast \text{ne})}{2 \ast \text{TR} \ast M}$

TR: test requirement (0.001)

Figure F.1

NOTE 1: At the beginning of the test, an artificial error is introduced.
This ensures that an ideal DUT meets the valid range of the early pass
limit. In addition this ensures that the complementary experiment
(F.1.4.2 bullet point (2)) is applicable as well.

> For the check against the early fail limit the artificial erroneous
> sample, introduced at the beginning of the test , is disregarded.

Due to the nature of the test, namely discrete error events, the early
fail condition shall not be valid, when fractional errors \<1 are used
to calculate the early fail limit: Any early fail decision is postponed
until number of errors ne ≥7. In the blocking test any early fail
decision is postponed until number of errors ne ≥ 8.

NOTE 2: F=0.2% is intended to be used for a test containing a few
BER/BLER tests (e.g. receiver sensitivity is repeated 12 times(3 RF
Channels \* 2 Power-supplies \* 2 Temperatures). For a test containing
many BER/BLER tests (e.g. blocking test) this value is not appropriate
for a single BER/BLER test.

The blocking test contains approx. 12750 single BER tests. A DUT on the
limit will fail approx. 25 to 26 times due to statistical reasons using
wrong decision probability at the end of the test F= 0.2%. This shall be
solved by the following rule:

All passes (based on F=0.2%) are accepted, including the wrong decisions
due to statistical reasons.

An early fail limit based on F=0.02% instead of 0.2% is established.
That ensures that wrong decisions due to statistical reasons are reduced
to 2 to 3 in 12750 BER measurements. If the fail cases are ≤12, it is
allowed to repeat each fail cases 1 time before the final verdict.

These asymmetric test conditions ensure that a DUT on the limit consumes
hardly more test time for a blocking test than in the symmetric case and
reduces the wrong decision probability considerably and on the other
hand the repetition allowance sufficiently suppresses the residual
statistically caused wrong verdict for the aggregate test.
